Reiss.
Maloney.
Murphy. Where the hell's Murphy?
-Hey, Jafo! Go find Murphy. -Yes, sir.
Sir, Lieutenant Kress wants you on the pad.
Sir?
Sir?
Lose something?
No. You're wanted on the pad.
-Mind if I ask what you're doing? -No. I don't mind at all.
Murph, feeling any pressure?
Yeah, about 15 pounds per square inch at sea level.
Where's Montoya?
Don't you check the duty board? He's on days.
I forgot.
You're flying with that new guy, Lymangood.
-The what? -Me. Lymangood.
Outstanding.
Captain Maloney and Officer Reiss, report to Operations.
If it was me, I'd ground him.
He'll be all right.
Personally, I wouldn't fly with him for a bull that pissed Jack Daniels.
Is that right?
-All set? -Yeah. Yes, sir.
-You sure now? -Yeah.
Airship-12 rolling out at 1959 hours.
No, make that 2000 hours. Murphy and Lymangood.
Where the hell's Montoya?
They say he put in for days after that wingding that Murphy threw.
No shit. Let me call Departure.
L.A. Departure Control, Air-12 out at... ...22000. VFR 5000 will be coming to you 1.25.
...22000. VFR 5000 will be coming to you 1.25.
Traffic advisory.
Lymangood. Lymangood...
...what brings you to Air Support?
Oh, I don't know.
I just put in for observer. I kind of liked the idea of it.
No guns. No kicking in doors. You know, just quiet.
Oh, yeah.
All these people! What do you suppose they're all doing down there?
According to the latest statistics, 1,000,775,000 of them...
...are getting it on.
That many, huh?
The rest are waiting for Laverne and Shirley.
Well, let's see what we can see here.
I got a black guy in a beanie.
Looks like he's selling dope out of a van.
-Is that a red beanie? -Yeah, that's him.
This is primo, man. You want it?
He's ours. Undercover Buy Program.
Right, right.
-You were at the briefing? -Yes, sir. Guess I just forgot.
You're gonna fit right in.
Air-12, we have a 211 in progress... ...at Burbank and Vineland.
Male Negro, orange shirt and cowboy hat.
He's armed and has a hostage.
Well, call it in.
Air-12 to Central. Proceeding to the 211 at Burbank and Vineland.
Let's get out of here, man!
Bitch!
You dumb idiot!
Air-12 to ground, your guy's heading for the junkyard.
Orange shirt and a cowboy hat, huh? Whatever happened to inconspicuous?
Hit him! Hit him with the light.
I got him.
-Jesus Christ! -Welcome to Air Support.
-Call an ambulance. -Right.
Look at that guy.
Ground units! A man with a gun is behind that dumpster.
No, the other way!
We're going down. We gotta dust him.
Hit the ground, son. Hit it!
Code 4. They got it knocked.
Sir, what was that business with the watch?
Back in the Ready Room, with the watch?
Sort of a test.
If you think you're going over the edge...
If you think you're going over the edge... ...you lose your sense of time.
With your eyes shut, you can't tell 25 seconds from 5.
I get it, sir. Yes, sir.
Stop calling me "sir." You sound like David Copperfield.
Yes, sir. I mean, okay, sir.
Check that ride at 10:00.
-Which one? -Underneath the tree.
How do you see that shit?
-See it? -Yep.
-It's got no plates on it. -Well, call it in.
Abandoned vehicle.
Air-12 to Central. Reporting an abandoned vehicle. It's a--
Come on, what kind of car?
It's a light tan Chevy.
It's got no front plates. It's got no plates at all.
It's near the top of the hill on Linden Road.
Very good.
Oh, thanks.
What time have you got? You got about 10:30?
Been talking to Montoya, haven't you?
Well, he did mention something about Encino.
I suppose you deserve full initiation.
You might as well have your picture taken.
Montoya thinks she's some kind of movie actress.
Just my damn luck if they had her working overtime tonight.
Those bastards.
Slave drivers. That's what they are.
They don't care how hard they work you, as long--
Oh, my God! There she is.
She's fantastic! Do you think she knows we're out here?
All she has to do is look out the window.
10:30, right on the dot!
If there's one quality that I admire in a person, it's punctuality.
And flexibility.
If a person says that they're gonna be at a certain place--
Oh, God!
How does she do that? How does she do that?
Beats the hell out of me.
Don't push on the pedals!
Would you look at her tan?
It's so even!
Oh, my God!
-What do you want? -Get the briefcase!
I think she doesn't know.
Somebody does.
All units in the vicinity handle a rape in progress. 8792 Linden Road.
Damn it to hell. I knew it!
Identify and handle, code 3.
Oh, shit! Come on, let's go, man!
Around the back.
Hold it! Freeze!
He's bought it. Get on the other guy.
No, let them go! Please, let them go!
-Over there. -I got him.
Sir, you okay? Sir?
Fine.
Get an ambulance.
Air-12 requesting an ambulance at 3920 Linden Road.
-How's the woman? -She looks bad.
Oh, hell! It's gone.
The Chevy. The junker. The Chevy.
It's gone.
For God's sake!
Air-12, wind 150 degrees at 22, clear to land.
Air-14, 1150 degrees at 12, clear for takeoff.
The old man wants to see both of you. Right now!
-I like your haircut. -I like yours too.
You know, one of the really fun things about this job...
...is reading the complaints of the public.
For example, tonight here we have a fella...
...that didn't appreciate us disturbing his sleep.
I just hope I'm not called on by the chief to explain...
...why two of my people were hovering over Encino at 10:30...
...while Commissioner McNeely was getting beaten...
...in her own front yard in fashionable Brentwood.
McNeely? That's her?
Of the mayor's Task Force on Urban Violence.
A touch of irony, if you like that sort of thing.
-How is she? -She was shot, Frank.
She's in Intensive Care. Shot by one of the rapists.
One of the rapists?
Assault. Attempted rape. That's what they're calling it.
There wasn't any rape.
Case is closed. There's two toes tagged in the morgue.
That abandoned car we called in? The Chevy. That was a stakeout.
No stakeout. A make-out. Kids who couldn't afford a motel.
Kids go to Mulholland. That's not the pattern.
Forget patterns, Frank. And get the hell off my desk, will you?
Get off!
All right.
It doesn't bother you that car has no plates?
That it wasn't there when we came back?
That rapists don't travel in pairs?
What bothers me is, some son of a bitch may ask what you were doing...
What bothers me is, some son of a bitch may ask what you were doing... ...five miles out of your patrol area!
...five miles out of your patrol area!
When I talk to you, I'll look at you.
It was my fault. I talked Murphy into taking us there.
You're supposed to be stupid, son. Don't abuse the privilege.
You think I haven't heard about that silly twit out in Encino?
I had 20 years in this outfit when you were sitting in front of the TV...
I had 20 years in this outfit when you were sitting in front of the TV... ...watching Bugs Bunny, gnawing on your Fudgsicle.
...watching Bugs Bunny, gnawing on your Fudgsicle.
Remember, Officer Murphy, there are people who don't like police officers.
They do not like the idea of helicopters flying over their homes...
...peeking in their windows.
You know what they'll do? They'll burn you...
...me, your idiotic friend here, and my whole damn division.
I don't want my division burnt!
So here's the way it's coming down with you guys!
-You're grounded. Both of you! -Grounded?
I gotta figure out where to hide you until this crap blows over.
Get out of here, Lymangood.
I mean, dismissed.
Stick around, Frank.
The review board wants to have you up for psychiatric re-evaluation.
Oh, come on!
What do you expect after your wig-out last month?
But there's a bright side to this. And a moral.
Morals are good for you. I love morals.
And the moral of this story is: If you are walking on eggs, don't hop.
That's it.
Don't hop!
Hello. Listen, it's me.
I don't know whether a post card from Laguna means we're speaking again...
...but call me when you get in, okay?
Even if you're not speaking, call me. Please? Okay, huh? Please, huh?
Hello. I'm back.
Is there no getting rid of this chick?
The reason I'm pressing is that I've got a really big favor I need.
I'm desperate! Desperate!
No matter what time it is, call me.
Please. Bye.
Freeze!
For chrissake, Murphy!
You wanna get yourself killed?
You bozo! How many burglars come in the front door with a key?
-You scared the shit out of me. -I'm sorry.
Came to make friends.
Here's your key.
Well, I guess that makes that official.
Where's my blender? I need it.
At 3:00 a.m.?
You have this problem. You don't return phone calls.
In the kitchen.
Hold him for me.
This kid must be deaf.
-You coming? -Where?
The Shocks' anniversary party. You remember.
Annie's been open for a year now. We're gonna have guacamole...
...and margaritas...
...and chili rellenos--
Fat chance, huh?
That must've been some leave you had in Laguna.
What did you do? Spend all your time on the pistol range?
Here it is!
What's this?
This is beautiful. Really!
-Could I please borrow this--? -No.
I'll wash it. It already belongs to you. I bought it for your birthday.
It already belongs to you. I bought it for your birthday.
-Really? -I thought I gave you that damn thing.
Never mind. This is beautiful. I love it!
Frank, I miss you.
I don't eat. I don't seem to sleep.
Maybe you ought to trade me in on a surfer.
Well, I tried that once, but it didn't work.
Come to think of it, neither did he.
Good night, Murphy.
Good night, you little faker.
Watch your legs.
Frank...
...we gotta get serious.
Now, I know you have a lot of problems right now...
...and I'd really like to help you.
"You can run, but you can't hide."
-Joe Louis. That's very good. -That's what I mean!
Frank, I'm gonna have to get tough on you. Are you ready for that?
I'm ready.
Five, four, three, two, one....
Cue Mario, take one.
The top story is still the assault and attempted rape of Diana McNeely...
...of the mayor's Task Force on Urban Violence.
McNeely's still on the critical list.
We spoke to Chief Jensen about the latest news.
We have nothing on the two assailants.
They were without identification...
...probably Latin American and almost certainly illegal aliens.
Our fingerprint teams are going over their car...
...which was stolen from a Santa Monica parking lot.
It is unclear what impact this incident will have...
...on the minority community, and the increasing racial tensions that--
We've just received word...
...that Alf Hewitt is standing by St. Joseph's for a live report.
Commissioner Diana McNeely died at 8:47 a.m...
Commissioner Diana McNeely died at 8:47 a.m... ...from a gunshot wound which penetrated her neck...
...from a gunshot wound which penetrated her neck...
...and lodged beneath the third cervical vertebrae.
She never regained consciousness...
...and if she had lived, would've been paralyzed.
This is Alf Hewitt, from St. Joseph's Hospital.
I've been trying to reach you. Why don't you answer your beeper?
I just want to tell you that next time I'm suspended, so's my fucking beeper!
-Feel better? -Yeah, a little.
Get down here. We just came up with a mince pie under each arm.
You're back on flying status.
You're assigned a special detail.
This is Mr. Icelan. Mr. Fletcher of Washington.
This is Frank Murphy.
We're glad we found you. We're due at the weapons testing range at first light.
-What do they call that place? -Pinkville.
Everything I'm about to tell you is highly classified.
Don't discuss it with anybody. We're testing a new helicopter prototype.
We've got our own pilot...
...but your city's been chosen as the operational testing area...
...and your mayor is very anxious that his people participate.
Ours is not to reason why...
...ours is but to submit to the vagaries of local politicians.
Smoke? Frank, is it?
No. Yes.
No: smoke. Yes: Frank.
I understand you flew in Nam, Frank.
That's right.
-Two tours, was it? -One and a half.
Why the foreshortened tour?
You know what they say about a second chest wound.
Nature's way of telling you it's time to go home.
Yeah, right. Right.
You gonna tell us about this special detail?
A lot of people are looking forward to the Olympics out here.
For a few short weeks, the attention of the world will be on this town.
Every nutcase and terrorist... ...and crazy with a pipe bomb and a cause is drooling about it.
...and crazy with a pipe bomb and a cause is drooling about it. That's what this detail's all about.
The potential for catastrophe.
We don't want any Munich massacres out here, Frank.
Are you talking about crowd control from the air?
Give that man a cigar.
That's been tried. It didn't work out so hot.
-Where was that? -Vietnam.
We added a few new wrinkles.
-Such as? -You'll see, Frank. You'll see.
This thing has antiterrorist capabilities. You saying it's armed?
That I am. That it is.
That sounds like it now.
It's illegal to arm police helicopters.
That would depend on the circumstances, wouldn't it?
A lot of people ain't gonna like this.
What do you call this, an "airbuster"?
The Special. But somebody hung a nickname on it.
-What? -Somebody hung a nickname on it.
Blue Thunder.
Okay, gentlemen, you wanna take your seats? Here she comes.
She don't look normal...
...she don't fly normal, because she ain't normal.
This whole ship is heavily armored...
...with Nordoc NATO armor one inch thick.
This ship is equipped with a forward mounted 20 mm electric cannon.
Its six barrels are capable...
...of firing 4000 rounds of ammunition per minute.
And that, gentlemen, is one hell of a shit storm in anybody's language.
Now, let's take a look...
...and watch the lady strut her stuff.
The red dummies are terrorists, white are civilians. Innocent bystanders.
The object is for our pilot to knock out... ...the red dummies and the black cars.
He shouldn't touch any of the others.
In a riot situation, we just want to get the bad guys...
...and protect the innocents.
Oh, my God!
That kind of firepower would be used in our worst-case scenario...
...like armed insurrection.
It's comforting to know you got it on tap.
Gentlemen, let me have your attention.
Notice the selectivity of the firing.
This is not a strafing run where you tear up a whole street.
This little lady picks her targets carefully. Now you watch.
Look at that. All the red dummies are blown to hell.
And a few white ones.
One civilian dead for every 10 terrorists. An acceptable ratio.
Unless you're one of the civilians.
All right. Last pass, gentlemen. Anybody wanna bet on the school bus?
We haven't told our pilot everything about the bus.
Let's see if he can pick up on what's wrong with it.
Damn it! Bloody gun!
Now, if you come down below, we'll take a closer look...
Now, if you come down below, we'll take a closer look... ...and I'll be glad to answer any questions you may have.
Terrific shooting, colonel. It was beautiful.
Beautiful, was it?
Goddamn it! I had another stoppage.
I nearly killed you on that second pass.
If it happens again, I'll have their balls.
There's somebody I want you to meet.
Well, what do you know!
Friend of yours?
An old war buddy. The bastard tried to have me court-martialed once.
Sorry I brought it up.
Look who it isn't.
Colonel, this is Captain Braddock of Astro Division.
And Frank Murphy. He'll do the actual testing over the city.
Finally made colonel?
If you're nice, nice things happen to you.
I'll try to remember that.
Step this way for any questions.
How did we draw him?
He and his observer were assigned to us.
-I didn't realize you were acquainted. -Only too well, I'm afraid.
I'd have had him up on charges if he hadn't caught some shrapnel.
He's totally unsuitable for our purpose.
I'll call Mr. Holmes tonight.
Don't bother him. I think we can handle it.
--30 million candlepower night sun with an infrared filter.
Over here is your TV camera, with 100-to-1 zoom lens.
-We could've used this in Nam. -We could've used something.
Do you think you can fly it?
You flew it, didn't you?
I'll check you out myself.
Be on the pad, 12 sharp.
Twelve sharp.
Catch you later.
Stand back from there.
Irritating little cocksucker, isn't he?
-Hey. Tequila breath! -My man in the sky.
-How do you like day shifts? -My bride's happier. But me?
-What's happening? -I gotta go take a flight check.
-What's happening? -I gotta go take a flight check. What do you make of this?
What it is?
I found it where Diana McNeely was killed.
I think it's about that urban violence stuff.
Can you translate this? It's in Spanish. I gotta log in, but I'll get back to you later.
I gotta log in, but I'll get back to you later.
Keep it under your hat.
Right under the hat. Look at this!
I gotta get dressed. I'll see you in a second.
Hey, how you doing? Thanks for the hat.
-How's it going? -What's this "JAFO" shit?
Look up. Look down. Look left. Look right.
-Don't worry. -What's JAFO?
You know what Montoya told me?
He told me you looped one of those things. A helicopter.
He's putting me on, right?
No, he wasn't.
You actually looped a chopper?
-That's right. -When?
When I was young and stupid.
You're telling me it was a complete 360? Right over the top?
-A full loop. -I thought that was impossible.
It is. It's aerodynamically impossible.
Anyone who tells you any different is a damn liar.
Now, you take the Ranger and I'll be in my bird.
We'll have a little game. Follow my leader.
Follow my leader.
Catch you later.
Catch you later.
Murphy, this is Cochrane.
Join formation with me, echelon right. And keep it tight.
Roger that, colonel.
Wanna show me that loop, Murphy?
Negatory.
I thought so. Okay, slide over to my left.
Come on, keep it tight.
Christ!
Any closer, we start eating blades.
We're following his leader.
Now push it over and pick up speed.
Follow me through a high-speed climbing turn.
Level out at 500 feet.
All right, Mr. Murphy. You take the lead.
Roger that.
Damn! Damn it! Shit!
We got a runaway!
Jeez! What was that?
Grab your ankles and kiss your ass goodbye.
-We're going down. -Shit!
Mayday! Mayday!
We're going down.
Willowbrook and Alameda. Request ambulance, fire.
Shut the fuel off. Shut the fuel off!
What? Fuel?
Heads up!
Jesus! Where'd that bus come from?
Steady. We're gonna make a house call.
Central, this is Blue Thunder.
It seems that we have a ship down, somewhere in the Watts area.
Are you all right?
-Are you all right? -Yeah.
Get the hell off me!
I hope you broke your fucking neck!
You could've killed half of my crew!
You knocked down the whole damn shack! Get the hell out of here!
-Listen, Dick. Thanks a lot. -Be careful.
-Take care. -See you.
Rather a near thing today. I heard your turbine failed.
Or was it your flying?
Back off, asshole.
What's that I hear? Threats?
Well, what a change. We are acting brave nowadays.
Are you threatening me, Murphy?
No, I'm telling you. Back off.
Catch you later.
-Can I see your watch? -Sure.
You know where it is, don't you?
Are you losing weight?
Getting older too. I think you have to turn up here.
Getting enough sleep?
Are we having two different conversations or I am going nuts?
The train ride. The train ride. I'll find it.
-If you don't run out of gas first. -What?
When that needle points to empty, it means you're out of gas.
That's broken. We got plenty.
Mommy! You missed the train ride.
Hang on.
-Are you crazy? -This a one-way street!
I won't tell if you won't tell!
Jeez, look out!
I'll tell you one thing, it's awfully hard to read.
-Yeah, I know. -It's part of a letter.
It says something about strangers in the barrio making trouble.
I don't know. Something like that. Here's a word...
...that isn't in Spanish: "Thor."
T-H-O-R.
-Thor? No. -Mean anything?
Strangers in the barrio making trouble.
I don't know.
Maybe I've been in this too long, but I think something bad's coming down.
Most of the official family of Los Angeles, led by the mayor...
...and the City Council, gathered with family members...
...and members of the black community at McNeely's funeral...
...who was tragically murdered several days ago.
Food's up!
McNeely, who chaired the Commission on Urban Violence...
...was an outspoken critic of police department policies.
The chief was in evidence as were many of his aides.
As temperatures stay high and tempers continue to fray...
...fires continue in the Watts area...
...the City of Industry, Pacoima and East Los Angeles.
You want ketchup on your sandwich?
Now where did he go?
Hey, Frank.
Frank, did you say you wanted--?
Frank?
Frank, are you okay?
Frank.
Is this something kinky?
Goddamn your black Irish heart...
...Frances McNeil Murphy, if you've left!
These are your television monitors. You have three.
The one in the center ties into all your computer banks.
The switches:
Night vision.
Infrared filter. Target system.
Whisper mode so you can travel silent.
Audio, which controls your outside mikes which are here.
What's the sensitivity?
You can hear a mouse fart at 2000 feet.
Now, gentlemen. This is your Harrison fire control helmet.
This baby is the heart of your system.
Let's take a look and see how she works.
Watch this.
It superimposes the gun cues on the real world.
Wherever you look, the guns follow.
You can zero in on any target you want...
...just by putting the green tracer line on your target.
-You wanna give it a shot? -Yeah.
What's that, 3/4-inch video?
You know something about it?
-That was my rate in the Navy. -What ship?
-Midway. -No shit. I was on the Forrestal.
It's a hell of a setup. Let me show you.
It goes in a locked memory bank here in the belly.
Each reel is code-numbered.
This little bug erases the tape on a signal from Central Command.
The tape's gotta be inside the case to erase.
It only erases in the case? That's great.
Adjust for your eye until the red dot rides on your tracer line.
Then press the cannon button and zap! Where you look is where you hit.
Sunshine! Just blew your gizzard away.
What's all this shit I hear about you threatening Cochrane?
Thank you, sergeant.
What?
In the police garage. After your crack-up.
Feeling a little hostility?
I told him to back off, that's all.
That's all? Well, it's enough.
They don't care if you kill yourself. They got $5 million in this aircraft.
They don't want to see it totaled.
Some kind of bullshit.
Hey.
If you want my opinion...
...I think the feds are after your ass. Better watch it.
Okay, thanks.
Hey, Matusek? How do you control the oscillation of the quartz?
It's the difference between the output of the generator signals. See?
Hey, Jafo. This isn't any night school.
We got a test flight to make out there.
-Good night. -Good night, kid. Take it easy.
-Big Brother, on or off? -What's Big Brother?
The cabin mike. It records everything we say.
I think we can lose that.
I got the fuse right here.
Get your hat off those circuit breakers.
Tell me what JAFO is. I'm putting the fuse here.
You'll find out. Just be patient.
Night vision. Checked, okay.
Target systems checked, okay.
Let's see what's on HBO tonight, okay? Check.
Blue Thunder to tower, requests permission for takeoff.
Blue Thunder, Tower unable to issue departure clearance at this time.
This isn't a very good idea. He hasn't even got clearance.
It's just an orientation flight.
Holmes is arriving tonight. Let him take care of it.
-What do you want? -Clear him.
Blue Thunder, Tower. Wind 330 degrees at 15. Clear for takeoff.
Roger, Tower. Blue Thunder off at 2030.
Be coming to you. Traffic advisories.
Let's hope he knows what he's doing.
How does she fly?
It's nose-heavier than the ayatollah.
-You're crazy. This stuff's great. -Great, huh?
-Okay, let's see what this turkey's got. -Let's go!
Hey. Hey.
-Orbit right. Orbit right. -What?
-Hi, there. -Hi.
You gotta hear this.
I wondered if you knew where a guy could get something good to eat.
It depends on what a guy's hungry for. Know what I mean?
I'm going to video.
A little sushi would be nice.
-Sushi? -Remember the last time we did this?
-Try the zoom. -Zoom, right.
Seventy-five?
Are we talking about American money?
We certainly are.
Come on, lady. You know--
Look at this. Hot Chihuahua!
Honey, that's a little steep.
I want it! I want it!
Let's lose this asshole. He's breaking my heart.
Let's lose this asshole. He's breaking my heart. Come on. We gotta go to work.
Bye-bye.
I dig this police work.
Yeah. You're breathing heavy.
All right, here goes the whisper mode.
Whisper mode.
That's a check.
Hey, that's smooth!
Forest Lawn.
Hey. Check this place over here at 3:30.
Is that a state cycle in the driveway?
-That's highway patrol. -Can you make the license?
-Can you bring it around? -Yeah.
That's 221 Bravo 6.
I know that cycle. Jack Moran. Double Dork.
Double Dork?
Try that thermograph.
Thermograph. Cutting in thermograph.
Coming in.
The motor looks hot.
It hasn't been there too long.
-Want me to see if the owner's home? -Sure. Can we do it?
That guy, Matusek, he cleared me this morning.
This sucker'll do everything but cook your breakfast.
H-23.
H-23.
Let's see, the house is right here.
Let's see, the house is right here. -She's there! -How does the computer know?
-She's there! -How does the computer know?
They clear it with their security patrol...
...and then they zap it right to us.
Let the good times roll!
No. No.
Not yet. Not yet.
I'm not ready!
Stupid putz!
Sounds like old Double Dork is missing a step or two.
-We recorded all this? -It's all on tape.
Locked in the memory bank in the belly.
I think old Double Dork's entitled to a quickie. Don't you?
Absolutely.
Can you erase that tape?
The memory bank's locked, but I can get in.
Good.
This mother hears through walls, fires 4000 rounds a minute...
...and peeks down dresses at 1000 feet. Jesus Christ!
This terminal here is hooked into every data bank that there is.
A dozen of these and you could run the country.
Watch this. I feed it my name, right?
They got your whole life in here.
Hit mine.
Murphy...
...Frankie.
File under repair?
Did you break your file? That's weird.
Special Base to Blue Thunder.
Blue Thunder.
-It's a wrap tonight. Come on home. -10-4.
Right, I'd better get going.
You'd better go too, Mr. Fletcher.
I'll come along there when he's in.
Yeah, right.
Blue Thunder, wind 270 degrees at 12.
Blue Thunder to base, final approach.
Altimeter, two-niner-niner-five. Cleared to land.
Does Cochrane drive a gray Corvette?
Yeah. Why?
Check 9:00. He's in some kind of hurry.
Oh, yeah.
Listen. Check Cochrane out.
-On the computer? -Yeah. I'm gonna tag along.
Blue Thunder, this is Tower.
Do you copy? Is there a problem?
That's Cochrane, F.E., U.S. Army.
F.E. What's F.E. stand for?
"Fuck Everybody."
Gnarly!
We're almost there.
This is Tower. Do you copy?
Base, you're coming in garbled. Can't read you.
I got Washington.
Go for it.
Cannot read you, Special Base. Still garbled.
Blue Thunder, come in. Do you read me?
Breaking up, Special Base. Can't read you. Still garbled.
Here it comes.
"Sole survivor"? Is he kidding?
"Project Thor." Wait. Find out what that is.
Request information:
Thor Project.
I got it. Here it comes.
"Tactical Helicopter Offensive Response."
Offensive Response?
What does that mean?
Washington's jerking us around. They've got bigger plans for this.
-Blue Thunder, you will acknowledge. -Oh, shit!
Blue Thunder to Special Base--
Oh, shit!
-He's going in there. -Yeah.
Where are we?
-Federal Building. -Really?
Wanna find out what's going on?
Certainly. Here goes the whisper mode.
You get anything?
I just had a good shot of some guys emptying trash.
Can't use it.
Goddamn it to hell! What's going on out there?
I'm holding you responsible for that man's behavior.
Dr. Haycock strongly recommended he be grounded.
For your information, Mr. Icelan...
...there are no paranoid schizophrenics on duty here.
He checks his sanity with his wristwatch!
What do you check yours with? A dipstick?
I don't have to take crap from you.
He's finished as of now.
If there's a scratch on that aircraft, so are you.
All right, try the thermograph.
I told you it was cool.
Lovely, lovely!
-Park here. -I'll bring it around.
I got something!
-It locked! -Yeah. Hold it, hold it.
I still fail to understand.
The Astro Division is autonomous. The man was assigned to us.
-McNeely complicated it. -Fletcher!
I can't say you people have covered yourselves with glory so far.
If she hadn't started shouting, we wouldn't have had to rough her up.
Rough her up?
Is that a euphemism for "assassination"?
She had street informants, and she'd made the connection... ...between our project and the trouble in the streets.
...between our project and the trouble in the streets.
She was going public, on the record.
Who are these other guys?
-They can't hear me. -Shut up anyway!
-This pilot-- -Murphy. Frank Murphy.
Is that under control? I don't want attention.
Blue Thunder might be perceived as a threat.
-Drop the hammer on him. -What do you think?
I think, Mr. Holmes, that I should take him out.
You mean kill him?
-When? -As soon as possible.
Jesus Christ, Frank!
The boy loves me! You got this on tape?
-I got every word of it. -Good.
Give him all the help he needs.
This conversation never took place.
If it gets back to me, I'll deny it.
Oh, shit!
We're in deep shit! Let's get the hell out!
Tower, we have 330 degrees and 15.
Altimeter still 3000. Clear to land?
Air-12 traffic, 1:00 two miles north-eastbound.
It's a Cessna 182 at 5000 VFR.
Blue Thunder down at 2130.
Captain wants to see you in the office right away.
-I'll get the tape's keycard. -Be careful.
Yes, sir. I will.
Well, sir, he's-- He's not that--
Very well, sir.
I will.
All right, sir. I will.
Yes, thank you.
-Did you have a nice flight? -I enjoyed it.
I hope so. It's your last for a while.
-Now listen, Jack-- -No, you listen.
That's how it is from now on:
Me captain, you cop. Me talk, you listen.
If I don't have an ass when I get out of this chair...
...it's because the old man chewed it off.
You're beautiful when you're angry, but let's talk privately.
We don't have any secrets from Mr. Icelan.
You're off the program, Frank. You and your buddy Lymangood.
I'll be lucky if I'm not in Pacoima tomorrow...
...driving a black-and-white.
Captain Braddock speaking.
Yes, sir. He's here, colonel.
Icelan.
Guys, don't forget to check under the hood.
Just gonna get my cuff links.
Who are you conning with that phony radio bullshit?
For chrissakes, that went out 3 days after Marconi invented it!
Captain Braddock speaking.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. It's taken care of.
Who unlocked the memory bank?
That tall numb-nuts cop.
-Lymangood? -You got it.
Son of a bitch!
Hey!
Get his gun!
Take it easy.
Pay attention. Pay attention!
-We don't wanna hurt you. -We want the tape.
Let's be reasonable.
You'll tell us what we wanna know sooner or later.
And I think you'd rather it be sooner.
Because first, we're gonna break your fingers...
...then your arm, then maybe your knees.
Now, I know you don't believe me...
...so I'm gonna show you.
Now, can it be sooner?
The tape.
It's in your car?
Check the car.
You wanna tell us where it is?
You wanna write it down? Thattaboy!
All units, detain and hold for questioning...
...Officer Frank Murphy... ...in connection with the death of Officer Lymangood.
Possibly driving a black '79 Trans Am...
...California license, 909 King-Edward-Boy.
I want to get a confirmation on that.
This is Air-12 to Central.
Can we get a confirmation on that dispatch?
Black '79 Trans Am. California license 909 King-Edward-Boy.
Officer Frank Murphy. Detain and hold for questioning...
...in connection with the death of Officer Richard Lymangood.
So far, so good.
Check out Big Brother's tape in Blue Thunder to learn more.
I just heard about Lymangood. I'm really sorry.
Call me if you want to talk.
-Here's your tea, colonel. -Thank you.
Why don't we just blank the tape?
That's what it's designed for, right?
They tell me Lymangood changed the code numbers.
To go through every possible combination would take forever.
The trouble is, we don't have forever.
Hey, boss. How's it going?
Listen, I got the tape...
...but it's not safe to take it home.
So I'm gonna-- There's this drive-in that I go to...
...at Riverside and Victory, on the corner.
There's a dumpster in the back, behind the concession stand.
And I'm pretty sure they don't empty it until Monday.
So that's where I'm gonna stash the tape, okay?
This is getting kind of fun, huh? Cops and robbers, for real!
Well....
Good luck if you should decide to accept this mission.
This is Lymangood.
I forgot to tell you. I found out what "JAFO" is:
"Just Another Fucking Observer."
You're not supposed to be in there. Get the fuck out!
You talking to me, asshole?
Damn. Murphy!
This is Special Base. Come in.
Shit!
Los Angeles mobile.
Mobile, listen. Get me KBLA-TV.
That number's in your directory.
Don't give me static. This is a police emergency.
Get me KBLA now!
Good afternoon, KBLA-TV.
I want to speak to Mario Machado or Alf Hewitt.
They're out in the field. Wanna leave a message?
Tell them Officer Frank Murphy is calling.
I'm sending them a package. Do you read me?
That's Frank Astro?
No, Frank Murphy. Astro Division...
...police emergency. Got it, sweetheart?
-Yeah, I got it. -Okay. Mobile? Mobile?
-Los Angeles mobile. -Listen, I need another number.
-Hello? -Kate, it's Frank.
Where are you? I've been worried sick.
I'm okay. Do me a favor and pick up a package for me.
It's in a drive-in at the corner of Victory and Riverside.
It's near the concession stand, in a dumpster.
-And then what? -Take it to KBLA-TV.
To Mario Machado or Alf Hewitt.
-Don't stop for anything or anybody. -Got it.
-Okay. Thank you, baby. -Bye.
Where is he now?
Over the Hollywood and Ventura Freeway interchange.
Get the mayor's office on the phone.
We're gonna get the Air Force, and now!
He called Channel 8 first. The second call was to his girlfriend.
Forget about the police. Get our own cars to her place and that TV station!
The bastard wants to go public!
-We'll stop that. -We'd better!
Come on, move out!
Move, move!
-Damn it, I can't see nothing! -There she goes!
Air-7 to Special One.
Air-7 to Special One.
No shit, pendejo!
Set that thing down, man.
We got two choppers full of SWAT guys.
It's getting real cozy up here.
Return to base or we're gonna open fire.
Come on, will you, Murphy?
All right, knock him down.
Okay, amigo, how's your auto-rotation technique?
Son of a bitch!
Damn it! Hang on!
Sorry about that, my friend.
Not again!
All right, chaps. How'd you like to follow my leader?
-Pull up now! -Pull up!
Okay, lady! Pull over!
Is there a problem, officer?
A den mother in a Vega, right?
Now play it very cool. I need your license and your registration.
Sure.
-I think I left them-- -Get out of the car.
Channel 8 is bringing you live coverage of a helicopter hijacking.
Stay inside your homes. There's a sniper over Los Angeles.
We've already lost one police car and two helicopters.
Well, what now, gentlemen?
I don't plan on losing more helicopters.
May I introduce Colonel Coe of the Air Force?
-Colonel. Mr. Mayor.
A couple of F-16s are standing by at March Field.
-F-16s? -We can take him out now.
-All you've got to do is say the word. -The F-16 is armed with rockets.
The potential destruction of innocent life is unimaginable.
The F-16 is armed with heat-seeking missiles.
We can surgically remove him. Like a tumor.
We're not talking about a tumor.
You gotta make a right there!
No, Kate.
You're really riding with the angels, sweetheart.
Thattagirl. Good work!
Ray Icelan at Astro says they've scrambled two F-16s out of March.
-What about the tape? -No sign of it.
But he called KBLA. Fletcher's there to intercept.
I'll take care of you one at a time.
We'll have more help down here. Just be calm.
Sir! Sir! I've got to give this tape to Mr. Machado or Abe Hewitt.
-They're very busy right now. -Yes, but this is from Frank Murphy.
There's a crazy man in a helicopter. I'll tell somebody you're here.
The most dangerous thing is a man afraid for his job.
I'm Dick Fisher. I'll get that to Mario if you'd like.
No, I have to give this to Mr. Mocher or--
Machado.
I'm his producer. I'd be delighted to bring it up to him.
I don't think so.
Can't we erase it? Isn't that what the bug's for?
We don't know the code number.
Then erase them all.
-Why don't you give it to me--? -Frank said to give it to Mr. Hewitt--
I'm Alf Hewitt. You're the lady with the tape from Frank Murphy?
Your producer said that Mr.--
Who? I never saw this guy before in my life. Come on, let's go.
Not so fast. That's government property.
-Get your hands off me! -Stop him!
Get this bastard off me!
Son of a bitch! I'll blow your head off!
Go, go, go! I got the tape!
March Control, this is Little Brother One.
We have your target bearing 121 at 13 miles.
Request clearance to engage. Over.
Roger, Little Brother. This is March Control.
Affirmative. Engage and destroy.
I repeat: Engage and destroy.
There he is. He's all yours, cookie.
Holy shit!
What?
Well, I'll be damned.
One of your missiles just took out a barbeque shack down in Little Tokyo.
-Francis, isn't that Ray's district? -Yes, it is.
You have his number?
Call him, or they'll call him and he'll call us....
I'm on my way!
There he is, right there!
All right, everybody, this is an emergency!
-All right, clear the area. -Clear the area!
Well, what do you know!
He froze.
Okay, he's all mine now, Cookie.
Oh, my God!
I'm hit, cookie! I'm hit!
He blew my goddamn wing off!
Mayday! Mayday!
This is Little Brother One. I'm ejecting!
We just lost an F-16 and the top of the Arco Tower. Now what?
That's it. Call it off.
May I remind you there is a crazy man up there with six 20 mm cannons?
I said, call it off.
Request permission for takeoff.
Colonel, hold your position. Operation canceled.
Repeat: Hold your position. Do not take off.
Back to base.
Rough her up? Is that a euphemism for "assassination"?
She had street informants, and she'd connected our project to the trouble--
Jesus, Lollie, you ought to hear this stuff.
They sound like cops and feds.
They're stirring up the barrio to prove what that chopper can do.
Tell Mario to go easy on that "mad-sniper" stuff.
That cop may be the hottest ticket since Horatius at the bridge.
All right, let's try this.
All right, where are you?
Oh, damn it!
All right, Murphy. It's about time you put your money where your mouth is.
One, two...
...three!
Come on, you tub of shit!
That's impossible!
Catch you later.
Okay. And now it's your turn.
The $5 million prototype was destroyed when Officer Murphy, out of gas...
...set the helicopter down on the tracks in front of a freight train.
That was the end of the helicopter, but not of this story.
On the strength of a tape that Murphy delivered to this reporter...
On the strength of a tape that Murphy delivered to this reporter... ...the mayor's reopened the investigation of McNeely's death...
...the mayor's reopened the investigation of McNeely's death... ...which might also be connected with the death of Officer Lymangood.
...which might also be connected with the death of Officer Lymangood.
Half a dozen local police officers...
...and several officials of the State and Justice departments...
...have been detained for questioning.
Coming up, weather...
This is the hour, ours is the magic Ours is the power, now is the time
This is the hour, ours is the magic Ours is the power, now is the time
This is the hour, ours is the magic Ours is the power, now is the time
This is the hour, ours is the magic Ours is the power, now is the time
Ours is the hour, now is the time Ours is the hour, ours is the magic
Ours is the power
I need your seat in the upright position, please.
Come on, let's go. Come on, darling, taxi's waiting.
Come on. It's raining.
-Oh, no. -Oh, yeah, it's a lot drier in here, Dad.
-Oh, God. We need a new roof. -Yeah.
-But it's big. It's big. -I like the peg and groove floors.
-Damask curtains would look nice. -Yeah.
-Damask curtains would look nice. -Yeah. -I gotta get this roof fixed, honey. -Yeah.
-I gotta get this roof fixed, honey. -Yeah.
I found this out back. Do you want it?
Relax. What's the matter with you? Relax.
-Dad! -What? What is it? What?
Hey! What the--?
Get the hell out of here! What the hell?
Sarah, you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. He surprised me, that's all.
Yeah, I guess.
-Are you sure? -Yeah. I'm fine.
Dad.
You could wait. You know, just until you got a school uniform.
-You don't have to go now. -I can't stay home...
-You don't have to go now. -I can't stay home... ...and watch TV for the rest of my life.
Why not? I could.
I just wanna get started and get it over with.
You look good. You look good. Good luck. Jenny will pick you up.
-I'll walk. -Are you sure?
Yeah.
-Hey, scary bitch alert. -Oh, God. I thought it was Satan.
Oh, my God. She's-- She looking?
Oh, God. Oh, she's looking. Find a warm place--
A safe, warm place.
The almanac says today will bring an arrival of something.
Yeah, wonderful, I'm getting my rag.
"A new wholeness and with it, a new balance.
Earth, air, water, fire." Maybe it's our fourth.
-We don't need a fourth. -Nancy, we need someone...
...to call out the corners: north, south, east and west.
-Four would make a circle. -Maybe she can be our fourth.
-Come on. -I love a woman in uniform.
Oh, you mean, did I get laid?
Oui, beaucoup des-- Beaucoup de "laid."
What is that snail trail over there saying about me?
You know, this is L.A. We should be learning Mexican, like....
-That would be Spanish, genius. -Spanish.
She's here.
-"She" who? -Someone to be the fourth.
-"She" who? -Someone to be the fourth. She's the one.
Are you feeling okay?
That's her.
Hey, do you guys mind if I sit with you?
Because I'm supposed to find a lab group.
Okay.
No, you-- You can sit here.
Happy?
What?
-Hi. -Hi.
-You're Sarah, right? Hi, I'm Chris. -Yeah.
I wanted to apologize for those guys in French. They're assholes.
They say you are what you hang with.
Yeah, right.
Wait, did you just call me an asshole?
-You did, didn't you? -I'm sorry.
My defenses are up. People here have been really rude to me.
-Oh, really? Who else? -These three girls. Look behind you.
Don't stare.
That's slick.
-Oh, shit, it's the Bitches of Eastwick. -What?
Whatever you do, stay away from them.
Why?
Well, you see the one on the right? She's a major slut.
I mean, I don't know from experience or anything, but....
And the one in the middle, she's got these burn scars all over her body.
I haven't seen them, but friends of mine have.
Anyway, they're-- No, never mind.
What? What?
-They're witches. -Witches.
Well, that's what people say.
So, what are you doing after school?
-I don't know. Nothing, I guess. -Really?
-Really. -I'm busy.
-Really. -I'm busy. Football practice. You can come to watch.
Football practice. That is so tempting.
-Sarah. Looking for someone? -No.
Some football dicks make their girlfriends...
...come and watch them practice, as if it's interesting.
Yeah, like the girlfriend over there. Chris Hooker?
I don't even know him.
Nancy's sorry about what happened in biology.
And she's mean to everybody, so don't take it personally.
-You're Nancy? -She's Nancy.
I'm Bonnie and that's Rochelle.
-Hi. I'm Sarah. -Yeah. We know who you are.
-Do you wanna go for coffee? -No, I can't. I gotta get home.
My dad's waiting for me.
You can make something up. Rochelle's ditching practice.
-He comes on to anything with tits. -Except me.
-I'm not watching him. -He spreads disease.
I speak from personal experience.
Run, Chris! Go long! Go for the pass, baby.
He's a jerk.
Come on.
-So you're coming, right? -Where we going?
-Shopping. -Come on.
-I don't have any money. -We get a five-finger discount.
Five-finger discount.
-Sarah, where'd you live before? -San Francisco.
-Why did you move? -Because it sucks there.
My dad wanted to.
-It sucks here too. -I know. You need a car here.
-You need a car everywhere. -What's up with that?
I slit my wrists.
Sorry.
-What did you do it with? -With a kitchen knife.
-You even did it the right way. -Yeah.
Punk rock. Let's go.
The "right way"?
-How do you know the right way? -Shut up, Rochelle.
Well, how do you know?
Sarah.
What?
-Put this in your bag. -No.
Everything in nature steals, you know. Big animals steal from little ones.
They steal for survival. Besides, I already have a diary.
This is different. You put spells and power thoughts in it...
...and then you don't let anyone else read it, ever.
Except maybe us.
Here.
-You guys are really into all this? -Sort of.
-That's not for you. -I'm sorry.
What a beautiful ring. It was your mother's.
Yeah, it was.
Are you going to pay for those?
You're not like your friends.
-You know how to use candles? -Yeah. You light the wick.
More than that. Red is for love.
Black-- Actually....
Why you don't read that?
-It explains it all. -Okay.
-It explains it all. -Okay. Twenty dollars.
Twenty dollars.
You know, I've never read anything about this stuff before.
I mean, I don't follow it.
Maybe you're a natural witch. Your power comes from within.
Come on, Sarah.
-You guys, I think I should head home. -Just look straight ahead and keep up.
-Please, my baby needs some food. -I don't have anything.
Don't give them money. You're gonna get nailed.
-I don't have anything. -Hey, I know you.
I have another snake for you.
Hey, wait a second. I have to talk to you.
I had a dream about you.
In my dream, you were dead!
I'm talking to you.
Come back, child. Come back to Jesus.
Don't you run away from me! I am the god of the--
I know what I'm talking about. I'm in touch with the man!
Listen to me!
Come on, Sarah. Let's get out of here.
Oh, my God.
-Is anybody back there? -No.
We hit him. It hit him. The car hit him and we made it happen.
-Maybe, maybe not. -No.
I thought, "It's gonna hit him."
-I thought it too. -Well, I thought it too.
-Sarah, did you think it? -Yeah.
That's it. Sarah's the fourth. North, south, east and west.
That's it. Sarah's the fourth. North, south, east and west. We can make things happen. I mean, this is it. This is real.
We can make things happen. I mean, this is it. This is real.
Shit.
You guys, this is really weird.
I mean, he was after you. He was gonna hurt you, man.
-It's not our fault, I mean-- -Maybe he'll really listen now.
-Who? -Manon.
What's that? That's, like, God?
No, man invented God. This is older than that.
Do you guys worship the devil?
It's like God and the devil.
I mean, it's everything.
It's the trees, it's the ground, it's the rocks, the moon.
-It's everything. -It's nature.
If God and the devil were playing football...
...Manon would be the stadium that they played on.
It would be the sun that shone down on them.
So does stuff like tonight happen to you a lot?
No. Not like that. Other stuff.
-Where did you learn it? -I don't know.
A natural witch.
I hate it. It's always getting screwed up.
It's like sometimes I'll want it to rain...
...and a pipe will burst in my room and it'll just get flooded.
-Yeah, right. -No, really.
Or I'll want it just to be quiet, and I'll wish for it and wish for it.
And then I'll go deaf for three days straight.
If you can do that, have you ever heard of invoking the spirit?
No.
That's when you call him.
Manon.
It's like-- It's like you take him into you.
It's like he fills you.
He takes everything that's gone wrong in your life... ...and he makes it all better again.
...and he makes it all better again.
Nothing makes everything all better again.
Maybe not for you.
-Where are you going? -You guys are freaking me out.
Oh, she's scared.
-Nancy, we need her. -Like a hole in the head.
She'll be back.
What?
You sounded strange when I called last night. I didn't think you'd come.
-No, I was just surprised. -Surprised?
-I thought you'd be with those girls. -What girls?
-Those girls with the weird heads. -Weird heads?
-Yeah. -What's weird about their heads?
Well, that one girl, you know, she's got a mammoth head.
-Really? -Yeah. She looks like a St. Bernard.
-I haven't noticed her. -I hate that, that big head thing.
Of course, it's better than that shrunken head thing.
Makes you wanna hang it from the rearview mirror.
What's your obsession with heads?
Well, I was just noticing how great yours is.
-You like my head? -Yeah, it's a good head.
-"It's a good head." -It's good. It's good for kissing. Can I?
-We'll see you later, bro. -Nice meeting you, Sarah.
-Yeah, bye. -See you.
Come on. Let's go to my house. Nobody's there.
I don't-- I don't wanna go.
I can't. I gotta go home.
All right.
Are you mad?
No.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
So, hot stuff, how did it go?
-How'd what go? -Your date with Chris.
-What are you talking about? -Chris already told everybody.
-He told everybody what? -That you guys did it.
But we didn't do it.
Well, maybe he was just trying to save face then.
Because he's going around the whole school...
...saying that you're the lousiest lay he's ever had.
And coming from him, that's pretty bad.
-No, he didn't. -He did.
He said the same thing about Nancy.
I told you he was a jerk.
Can I talk to you for a sec? Chris?
I'm sorry. Chris is really busy.
Maybe we could set something up for-- Nice jacket.
--later in the week.
Why did you lie about me?
Look, I don't wanna go out with you again. Okay?
Please stop begging. It's pathetic.
Hey, Chris.
Fuck you.
No.
But I will.
She's gonna cry. And then I'm gonna cry.
Then we're all gonna cry.
This is a joke.
I can't even believe this.
Oh, wait, here she goes.
Shark!
-Very good. -Brilliant. Superb.
Oh, God, look. There is a pubic hair in my brush.
Oh, no, wait, wait.
That's just one of Rochelle's little nappy hairs.
Why are you doing this to me, Laura? Do you think you're funny?
You really wanna know why?
Yes, I really wanna know why.
Because I don't like Negroids. Sorry.
I've told you this before, but I wanna be really clear.
This is a very experimental procedure.
And we can't make any warranties regarding results or side effects.
I can tell you unofficially that there's little to no risk.
With this form of gene therapy, it's relatively non-invasive.
It can be somewhat painful, but non-invasive.
Okay, try to stay relaxed.
I'm moving the armature over you now.
And you'll feel a little sting when the needle penetrates.
And then more when the needle moves.
I'll try and keep it as brief as possible.
Hold very still, but keep breathing.
Okay?
Good. Keep your body relaxed.
Just a little more, Bonnie.
Don't move.
Ray, the light's out! Oh, man.
You-- You didn't even pay the bill. I gave you money.
You didn't pay the bill. What you doing home so late?
You're late.
It's the storm, Grace. It's the connection, Grace.
-Oh, it's a storm? -That's why the lights are out.
The neighbor's lights aren't out.
I give you money, and you tell me you paid the bill.
But you can't even pay a bill? What are you good for?
You know what I'm good for.
Hey, Sarah. We're going on a field trip.
Miss Downs, I hate to interrupt your little social gathering.
Sorry, Sister.
Watch out for those weirdoes.
We are the weirdoes, mister.
Earth, air, fire, water
Earth, air, fire, water
Earth, air, fire, water
-Water, water, water -Air, air, air
Earth, air, fire, water....
It is better that you should rush upon this blade...
...than enter the circle with fear in your heart.
-How do you enter? -With perfect love and perfect trust.
It is better that you should rush upon this blade...
...than enter the circle with fear in your heart.
-How do you enter? -With perfect love and perfect trust.
It is better that you should rush upon this blade...
...than enter the circle with fear in your heart.
How do you enter?
With perfect love and perfect trust.
That's a girl.
As above, so below.
I drink of my sisters...
...and I ask for the ability to not hate those who hate me.
Especially racist pieces of bleached-blond shit like Laura Lizzie.
Right on.
I drink of my sisters...
...and I ask to love myself more and to let myself be loved by others.
Especially Chris Hooker. I know, it's pathetic.
Definitely pathetic.
I drink of my sisters...
...and I take into myself the power to be beautiful outside as well as in.
I drink of my sisters...
...and I take into myself...
...all the power of Manon.
That's all?
Blessed be.
-Blessed be. -Blessed be. Blessed be.
I thought you were gonna burp.
-Oh, my God. -What?
Look.
-It's Manon. -It's so beautiful.
He's listening to us.
-Do you think it's working? -I don't know.
I think he just looked at me. Did he look at me?
-Is he looking? -Not right now, but he just did.
-So weird. -I know. -He's looking? -Yes.
-He's looking? -Yes.
-Is he still back there? -Yep.
-Sarah. -Yeah?
Never mind.
-It's working. -That, or he's gone completely crazy.
-You hate me, right? -No.
-You don't? -No.
Because, you see, when you're a guy, and I am, people expect things.
I mean, I know I said some nasty things about you.
-Did you tell your friends? -What?
-That you're a lying sack of shit. -No, but I will.
-I'll tell them tomorrow. I'll tell the truth. -Good.
-Can I sit with you in Mass? -Yeah, sure.
Watch this:
Chris, could you carry these for me? They're really heavy.
Oh, and Bonnie's too. She's got a bad back.
And this. Thanks.
Hey, Chris, could you hold my jock for me? It's kind of heavy.
In the book of Genesis....
What are you, the Stepford boy?
Sit.
Hey. Pay attention.
It's working. Check it out, her spell is working.
Nancy, oh, my God. Would you look?
-I'm sorry, I'm really bad. -Get one in already.
Look, it's hard, you know.
You're like-- You're like two feet away from each other.
Get off.
-I'm not that heavy. -Yeah, you're light as a feather.
-During deep space travel. -I am, actually.
Did you guys ever play that game Light as a Feather, Stiff as a Board?
No.
One girl lays down and you surround her...
...and you put your fingers underneath--
Put your fingers where?
Okay.
Now, you take your index finger and your middle finger...
...and you put it under her, like this.
Now you have to imagine she's incredibly light, made out of air.
-Her whole body, or just her head? -Cow!
You guys, come on, concentrate, or it's not gonna work.
-I think I sprained my finger. -Shut up.
Focus.
Come on, you guys. Come on. Ready?
Light as a feather Stiff as a board Light as a feather Stiff as a board
Light as a feather Stiff as a board
Holy shit.
You guys, it's not working.
Shut up, or you're gonna fall.
How do I get down?
Who's got the instructions?
Just keep concentrating.
Amazing.
Hi, I got clean towels for everyone.
Oh, my butt!
-What's going on in here? -Nothing. Why?
-Are you girls getting high? -No, Mom.
-Are you okay? -You gotta try it.
-You pulled my hair out! -Sorry, I thought I saw a bug.
They have shampoo for that, you know.
Stupid bitch.
-Laura really has split ends. -Really?
I guess this confirms she's not a natural blond.
Bleach.
What do you think will happen to Laura?
I don't know. If she leaves you alone, nothing will happen to her.
I don't know. If she leaves you alone, nothing will happen to her. -Nothing could. -Fat chance.
-Nothing could. -Fat chance.
-Who's that? -That's my real mother.
-Where is she? -She died when she was having me.
-Sorry. -It's okay.
Manon. Take my scars.
Give me beauty outside as well as in.
Manon, take my scars.
Take my scars.
Take my scars.
Thank you.
-Don't hit your head on the board. -Put a lid on it, Laura.
Oh, my God!
-What's the matter? -Oh, my God.
-What happened? -I don't know.
What does it look like?
Gross!
Now I want you to remember that we may need several passes...
...before we can see any results.
-Is it better? -I can't tell yet, dear.
-Just a minute. -What does it look like?
I don't know. Just wait.
I can't believe it.
-It worked. -What?
It worked.
Bonnie.
Seriously, if you don't stop, you can-- You can go blind.
Hairy palms?
She was supposed to come back today. Did you talk to her?
-No. -Principal Draper has called... ...a special assembly during the second half of the fifth period.
...a special assembly during the second half of the fifth period.
-Homeroom starts at 8:45 sharp. -Sorry, my pedicure ran late.
Bonnie.
-Holy shit. -Hi, Bonnie.
-How's it going? -Yeah, how's it going, Bonnie?
My God.
You look so beautiful. I can't believe it.
-You did it. -No, I didn't.
-Yeah, you did. You totally did it. -I helped.
Come on, you made Chris love you. You own him.
You made Laura Lizzie's hair fall out.
You guys should see her. She has to wear a hat every day now.
Poor Laura.
-What's wrong with Nancy? -Her spell's not working.
-What spell? -I don't know.
I think she doesn't wanna be white trash anymore or something.
I told her, like, "You're white, honey. Just deal with it."
-I can almost see through this thing. -Leave me alone!
-Jesus. -God.
-You're supposed to act like a father. -I ain't her father.
Thank God.
Her father was the one who paid you $50 for a quick bang.
Hey.
-Don't you ever hit me! -Don't touch her! Stop!
What the hell is that? Oh, my God. Oh, God.
You pig.
Ray?
-O2's flowing. -He's asystole. We got a flatline.
What's happening? What's happening to him?
I know this is a difficult time for you...
...but it is procedure that I ask just a few questions...
...before we can start processing the policy.
I don't understand. What policy?
Mr. Saunders had a whole-life pension plan through the company.
And with benefits this size, it's standard that I--
What size?
Just a second.
Sorry.
A hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars.
A hundred--?
-Wait, are you saying this goes to us? -To you.
-A hundred and seventy-five-- -What a dear, sweet man.
-A hundred and seventy-five thousand! -A hundred and seventy-five thousand!
A hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars!
-I can't believe he's dead. -Do you think we killed him?
No. Not at all.
Hi! Don't be shy, honey. Nice ass.
Hi! Don't be shy, honey. Nice ass. -What? He has a cute butt. -You're a slut.
-What? He has a cute butt. -You're a slut.
Maybe you should go ask him out, Bonnie.
"I like your butt. Do you wanna have dinner?"
This is nice!
Bedroom, bathroom....
-Hi there. -You look so pretty.
I'm so glad you could come and see our apartment.
"Our apartment." We have an apartment.
It is so big. And look at this view. Look at it.
-It's beautiful. -Oh, look at the couch.
This is our couch. I love this couch.
I saw it in the window and I said, "I have to have this couch."
The guy, what an attitude. I said, "Wrap it up, I'll take it now."
Cash.
My jukebox.
Every song on here is by Connie Francis.
Yeah, isn't that great?
Ever since I was a little girl I said: All I want in life is a jukebox...
...that plays nothing but Connie Francis records.
That's great.
-Who's Connie Francis? -Oh, shut up, honey. Listen and learn.
Connie Francis--
-Shall we go to my room, girls? -It was nice to see you again.
Connie Francis is--
Wait a minute here....
-Let's have a housewarming party. -Sorry, Mom.
This is cool.
Hey, I was reading and I found something...
...I think you guys might be into.
"Glamour. Throwing a glamour, an illusion so real as to fool an onlooker...
Throwing a glamour, an illusion so real as to fool an onlooker...
...is one of the oldest forms of magic."
-I bet you I could do that. -You think?
This is to feel
This is to be
Shape and form it
For all to see
By the power of three times three
As I will it, so shall it be
-What? -My eyes are brown.
They're usually green.
You can do that with contacts.
Yeah, but it's good. I mean, it suits you.
-Subtle, but good. -You want something bigger?
-Subtle, but good. -You want something bigger? -I want bigger. -Bigger.
-I want bigger. -Bigger.
Concentrate, come on.
Ready?
-Are you impressed? -Yeah, I'm impressed.
-You look like Loni Anderson. -You wanna touch it?
Yeah.
-It's real. -And simpler than going to a salon.
-Yeah, really. -That's amazing.
Wait, wait, wait. Watch.
-Make me blond. -Me, me.
-No, no. Make me blond. -I don't think so. No way!
-Do something to me. -What do you want?
I want a smaller ass.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Oh, no.
Hey, why didn't you answer the phone?
-It's 3:00 in the morning, Chris. -Oh, yeah. That's a good reason.
-It's 3:00 in the morning, Chris. -Oh, yeah. That's a good reason. Hey, you know what I was thinking?
Hey, you know what I was thinking?
I was thinking maybe we could move in together.
I don't think I'm ready for that kind of commitment right now.
Oh, shit. Well, it's just that, you know, I can't stop thinking about you.
Oh, shit. Well, it's just that, you know, I can't stop thinking about you. And I don't know why, but I think I love you.
And I don't know why, but I think I love you.
And I've never loved anyone before, except maybe my mom... ...and this little puppy I had when I was little--
...and this little puppy I had when I was little--
-I think you should go home, Chris. -No, Sarah, wait, please.
Sarah, please, look.
I don't know what's happening to me. I can't eat. I can't sleep.
Can I help you?
No. Nobody can help me.
Here again. What can I do for you today?
We need provisions.
I need to undo a love spell.
When you open a floodgate, how do you undo it?
If you unleash something with a spell, there is no undoing.
It must run its course.
You should let him suffer.
It's not for you to judge suffering.
-What's behind the curtain? -Yeah, what are you doing back there?
Hiding all the missing kids from the neighborhood?
-What's there? Black magic? -True magic is neither black nor white.
It's both because nature is both. Loving and cruel all at the same time.
The only good or bad is in the heart of the witch.
Life keeps a balance on its own. Do you understand?
-Not really. -Well, then, understand this:
Whatever you send out, you get back times three.
-Wait, we didn't read that in any book. -No?
It's part of a basic spiritual truth, said in many ways, in many faiths:
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
I wanna buy this book.
You want to invoke the spirit?
You must be experienced to do this. It's very dangerous.
Look, lady, I'm a big girl, okay? Now, please just sell me the book.
-How much? -Twenty-five.
What do you know?
I have money.
When things were the worst for me-- This is before I tried to kill myself.
--I used to hallucinate things.
I'd close my eyes, and all I would see were snakes and bugs everywhere.
And then I'd open them, and they'd still be there. They wouldn't go away.
They're everywhere.
You know, the serpent is a very powerful being.
You should respect it.
Aren't you powerful? Yes, you are.
All right, enough screwing around.
Let's call the corners, shall we?
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the east
Powers of air and invention, hear me!
-Us. -Hear us
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the south

Manon! Fill me!
Is he here?
Did you feel that?
He blessed me.
I can feel him running through my veins.
He's still in me.
It's so amazing.
Look at this.
It's so beautiful.
This is a gift.
These are my gifts.
I can feel you in me!
I'm your daughter now.
He's everywhere! He's in everything!
Listen, all I'm saying is I think it's enough already.
I don't know what's going on with this. I'm completely humiliating Chris...
...when all I wanted was for him to like me.
And, Bonnie, what's going on with you? You used to be nice.
Now you're completely narcissistic.
Excuse me, but I spent a big chunk of my life being a monster.
Now that I'm not, I'm having a good time. I'm sorry that bothers you.
Can you guys tell me what color that light is?
It's red.
-Doesn't red mean stop? -Yeah. Red does mean stop.
It's like what Lirio was talking about, throwing things out of balance.
I know you guys think we're getting what we want...
...but it's gonna come back to us threefold.
Are we actually having a theological conversation here?
I mean, it's fun, it's scary. Who gives a shit? Oh, Nancy, we do.
Oh, Nancy, we do.
-What do you guys think? -They don't think.
Bitch.
Stop trying to win them over because it won't work.
I'm not trying to. You're paranoid.
-I'm paranoid? I am not paranoid! -Paranoid.
Will you guys shut up?
Do you want in, or do you wanna leave the circle? Tell me right now.
Why does it always have to be that way?
Because that's the way it is.
All I'm saying is I think you should think. And I don't want out.
And I don't want out.
One of these times, the light's not gonna be green, Nancy.
Are we scared, Sarah? Are you scared?
-Nancy! -That was actually pretty close.
It just keeps falling out.
I don't understand this.
What did I do to deserve this?
Laura.
What's the matter? What happened?
-I don't know. -It's okay. Calm down. Calm down. It's okay.
I'm gonna go get somebody, okay? Stay right here.
Sarah, come on, please.
I mean, you look like you need to talk to someone anyways.
How do you know what I look like? We're talking on the phone.
It's important, okay? I mean, I just need to be alone with you.
I have to see you. I don't know why but--
Why are you being this way? It's just dinner, come on.
-I don't know. I.... -Please.
-Okay, tomorrow night. -Yes! Yes, yes!
-I'll see you then. -Bye.
So when I started hanging out with them, I was almost relieved.
I didn't have that many close friends in San Francisco.
It just felt really nice to belong.
I disagree with them once and they turn their backs on me.
That's not friendship.
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.
You do? Yeah. You know, sometimes it's like we're one person, you know?
Yeah. You know, sometimes it's like we're one person, you know?
No, I'm not sure.
I'm not sure either. That's so funny. I was just thinking:
"I have no idea what I'm talking about."
Aren't we supposed to go to a restaurant or something like that?
No.
All right. Look, Chris, I know you think you feel really intensely...
...but do you ever stop and wonder where it comes from?
No.
I can't think, I just feel. It's weird how it happened.
I just woke up one day and I couldn't wait to see you.
It's like that every day. But now that I have you, I'm not letting go.
Let's just stop and think about what you're saying here.
You don't even know me.
-Here, I'll give you a backrub. -I don't want a backrub.
-No, it'll be nice. -Chris, I don't want you to. Let go.
-Relax for a second. Turn around. -I think you should take me home.
-No, Sarah, come on. -Take me home.
Well, then just hold me, okay? Hold me first.
Fine, I'll walk.
Damn it.
-Sarah. -No.
Sarah, get back here. Come back here now.
Goddamn it! It's gonna happen. Lie still.
Chris! Chris, don't, please. Let go!
Sarah!
Oh, my God. Sarah, come here.
What happened? Are you okay?
You should have seen the look in his eyes.
It was so weird.
They seemed empty, like it wasn't even him.
Where would he be?
There's a party.
At Trey's.
No, Nancy. Just leave it alone.
Don't go. You're not gonna help anything.
I'm gonna go play.
I can't believe she's here.
-Hey, guys. Nancy Downs is here. -Nancy?
I'm here. You're here. We're all here.
Is Sarah with you?
What's going on?
Where is she?
You and me, we've had some pretty good times together.
If I remember correctly, we had some pretty hot times too.
-Remember? -I've been trying to forget.
Forget?
-Forget this? -Stop.
What's the matter?
Not in the mood?
Not to get my dick bitten off.
What makes you think that's what I wanna do?
Go away.
Go away.
What the--?
-Surprise. -Sarah?
Make love to me, Chris.
-We should not be here. -Neither should Nancy.
Rochelle.
-How's it going? -Fine.
Listen.
You're a witch!
They were right.
They usually are.
Nancy, come on. Get off the bed. Let's go.
She's a witch too, you know.
The only reason you're in love with her is because she cast a spell on you.
-No. -Yes. Sad but true.
That's why I'm here. To help you forget about her.
-What do you care? -Nancy, get off the bed.
You scared the shit out of him. Thank you very much. Let's go.
No. He's gotta pay.
You're just jealous.
Jealous? Jealous?
You don't even exist to me.
You don't even exist.
You are nothing.
You are shit. You don't exist.
The only way you know how to treat women...
...is by treating them like whores when you're the whore!
And that's gonna stop!
Do you understand? Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm sorry.
He's sorry! Oh, he's sorry, he's sorry, he's sorry!
He's sorry! He's sorry! He's sorry!
Sorry, my ass!
No!
I didn't want-- I didn't want him to get hurt.
I liked him.
I think that he was a good guy underneath it all.
-I didn't know it would go this far. -Honey, come on.
I mean, it's hard for you. It was an accident. He fell.
Dad, I need to be alone right now, okay?
-Honey, listen-- -Don't touch me.
Everything I touch turns to shit.
I bind you from doing harm, Nancy
Harm against other people And harm against yourself
I bind you from doing harm, Nancy
Harm against other people And harm against yourself
I bind you from doing harm, Nancy
Harm against other people And harm against yourself
Sarah....
Stop it!
-Stop it! -Sarah!
There you are.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
-Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine.
We heard the police came to your house.
They came to mine too.
Yeah, well, I didn't tell them anything.
Well, then why do you wanna leave the circle?
-I didn't say-- -You don't need to say it.
You're thinking it.
Look, Nancy, people are dead, okay? Chris and Ray--
Those were accidents.
-They deserved it. -Says who?
Says me. And you know it's true.
Fine, whatever. I'm out.
Fine. That's fine.
We don't really need a fourth anymore, do we, girls?
No.
But if you're gonna leave...
...you might wanna think about leaving the school.
And maybe the city too. We're not sure.
Or the planet.
And please don't do any more spells on me.
I didn't.
You know...
...in the old days...
...if a witch betrayed her coven...
...they would kill her.
Bye.
Sweet dreams, Sarah.
How have you been sleeping?
Hello?
Hello!
Yes?
Hello.
-Hi. -What's wrong?
Oh, darling, what's wrong?
Look, I know that I don't know you very well or anything...
...but I-- I just didn't know where else to go.
It's those girls that I always come in here with.
They're trying to use magic against me.
You don't understand. They killed people.
And I tried to do a binding, and it didn't work.
Now it's like they're everywhere I turn.
They're all around me, and no matter what I do, they're still there.
I don't know what to do. You don't understand.
She's inside my dreams.
She knows what's going on inside my head.
She can read my mind.
I'm so sorry. I just didn't have anywhere else to go.
Please.
Come.
What is this?
This temple is built on a place of power.
You have a tremendous light inside you. More than any witch I've ever known.
More than any witch I've ever known.
-You must not be afraid. -I can't control it. I always end up hurting somebody.
I always end up hurting somebody.
Do you hear the voice of your mother?
What about her?
She's telling you to be strong. She was a witch too, of course.
Didn't you know?
No.
You can defeat those who challenge you.
But you must surrender yourself to the higher power.
-You must invoke the spirit. -But it made Nancy crazy.
She takes it to a dark place.
-Don't be afraid. Invoke him. -I can't.
There is no other way.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the north
It's Nancy. I can't stay here.
Sarah, stop! Sarah!
Hello?
Dad?
Jenny?
Hello?
They're gone. They flew back to San Francisco.
They thought you ran away back home.
Look, Sarah, there's been an accident.
What are you talking about?
What?
It's been all over the news.
Go look at your TV.
Wreckage from the plane was scattered over a one-mile square area.
Authorities suspect wind shear may have been responsible.
The FAA has retrieved the black box. An investigation is pending.

Please stop. Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it!
Gotcha!
God. If I was as pathetic as you are...
...I would have killed myself ages ago. You should get on with it.
Where are my dad and Jenny?
Oh, you'll be seeing them soon enough.
You're going to kill yourself tonight, my dear.
No, I'm not.
Surprise.
No.
Really?
The look in your eyes tells me you might not be so sure.
After all, you have every reason in the world to do it.
I mean, you killed Chris...
...and you killed your mom.
You killed your mom coming out of her. Now, that is really special.
Even I couldn't go that low. Bravo.
Stop it, please!
What's the deal? Why doesn't she use magic on us?
Because she's weak! Weak, weak, weak.
Stop, please.
Oh, God, you're so disgusting.
Now is the end Let her go in peace
Now is the end Let her go in peace
-I didn't write that. -Doesn't matter.
Handwriting still looks the same.
What's wrong with your scars, Sarah?
-It isn't real. -Then why are you still bleeding?
Run! Run back up to your room, like the little coward that you are.
She's so pathetic!
Damn it! Stop!
-Please, somebody help me. -"I'm bleeding."
Please.
What did I do?
Rochelle, go upstairs. See what's going on.
-No. This whole thing, it's just-- -No?
No.
Get your lazy ass up those stairs or I'll slit your throat!
You're as dead as she is.
Come on, I'll go with you. Shit.

He came to me. Saved me.
Oh, and he wanted me to give you a message:
You're in deep shit.
He says you've abused what he's given you.
And now you're gonna have to pay the price.
-Did he? -He did.
By the way, what happened to Rochelle and Bonnie?
They rushed out of here without even saying goodbye.
It's bad manners.
What's going on? What is going on?
Stop it!
Stop it!
Oh, relax, it's only magic.
Now who's pathetic?
I know I'm a little crazy.
I don't mean to be.
It all got out of hand, and I'm sorry.
No more games, okay?
Sarah, I'm so sorry.
Good.
-I'm gonna go. -One thing first.
I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm
Harm against other people And harm against yourself
-Wait. -I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm
Harm against other people And harm against yourself
-Wait. -I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm
Harm against other people And harm against yourself
I bind you--
I called him first!
You bitch, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
Where are you?
Where are you, Sarah?
Where are you?
Tricky. Tricky, tricky, tricky.
Sarah?
I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm
I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm
-Sarah? -Hi, Sarah. How are you?
Good. Then again, I can sleep at night so....
How are you?
We want to apologize.
-We feel really bad about-- -Trying to kill me?
-We feel really bad about-- -Trying to kill me? Yeah.
Honestly, we never thought it would go that far.
Oh, hi, girls. How you doing?
-Hi, Mr. Bailey. -Hi, Mr. Bailey.
You know that thing on TV about the plane crash was just a glamour?
I mean, it was a practical joke. -Funny. -Sarah, wait.
-Funny. -Sarah, wait.
We were just wondering, do you still have any powers?
Because we don't.
Sorry.
So if you ever want to hang out and chant, or call the corners....
Maybe. Hold your breath until I call.
She probably doesn't have any powers anyway.
Be careful.
You don't wanna end up like Nancy.
It's you. It's you. He did it. He gave me power.
I can do whatever I want now. I can fly!
I can--
He gave you something, honey. But it ain't the power.
But I can fly. I'm flying. I'm flying.
I'm flying. I'm flying.
Yeah. Well, I don't understand where we're going...
...or why we're bothering anyhow.
-You're doing a good deed. -Wanna give us a better reason?
A maniac hijacked a municipal bus with 30 passengers on it.
I got a hunch where those passengers are and who that maniac is.
You wanna share it with us?
Phoenix. Simon Phoenix.
Send a maniac to catch one.
Phoenix!
Don't move, Phoenix.
You're under arrest.
Ha-ha-ha. Arrest? Shit.
And you're trespassing.
Where are the passengers?
Oh, yes, the passengers.
Well, they're, uh....
Fuck you.
The passengers are gone. Ha-ha-ha.
See, I told the city, I said, "Look, nobody comes down here."
Postmen figured it out...
...policemen figured it out.
But the goddamn bus drivers just wouldn't listen.
Last time, Phoenix.
Where are the hostages?
To hell with the hostages. This is between you and me.
-Yeah. -What? What?
What you got, soldier boy? Do something.
Go ahead. Ha-ha-ha.
You're up to your ass in gasoline.
Set your ass on fire.
Is it cold in here?
Or is it just me?
Where are they, Phoenix?
Now, where did I put them? Ha.
I swear, I'd lose my head if it wasn't attached.
I'll keep that in mind.
Damn it, John, I'm tired of this Demolition Man shit.
You were not supposed to come down here.
You were not supposed to attempt the arrest of Phoenix singlehanded...
...or blow anything up!
It's not me. He dumped the gas and rigged the place to blow.
You had nothing to do with it.
I know you've tried to nail this psycho for two years.
But try remembering a thing called official police procedure.
-Where are the hostages? -Not here.
-What do you mean? -He must've stashed them someplace else.
Are you sure they weren't in there?
I did a thermo check and there was eight of them, all part of his gang.
Wrong again!
-You got something to say? -Ha-ha-ha.
-Get him out of here. OFFICER: Let's go.
Oh, you motherfucker.
You and I are gonna have a nice long chat.
FIREMAN: Captain! Captain!
Over here. There are bodies everywhere.
There must be 20 or 30.
They're everywhere.
See that? I told him. He said he didn't care.
Oh, my God! How could you sacrifice all those innocent people for little old me?
What kind of man are you?
We'll spend a lot of quality time together. See you, sweetie!
Honey! Sugar!
You got a lawyer, you better call him.
SMITHERS: John Spartan, you've done great deeds for the city of Los Angeles.
So it is with some regret that I, William Smithers...
...acting as assistant warden, hereby carry out this sentence.
Skip it.
You've been sentenced to...
...70 years' sub-zero rehabilitation in the California Cryo-Penitentiary...
...for the involuntary manslaughter of 30 innocent civilians.
Skip it.
SMITHERS: You'll be placed in cryostasis for the duration of your sentence...
...during which your behavior will be altered through synaptic suggestion.
You'll be eligible for parole no earlier than the year 2046.
I'm sorry, sergeant.
MAN [OVER SPEAKER]: All personnel...
...the next scheduled parole hearing for prisoner Gilmour...
...will take place at 0715.
Warden William Smithers, report to Level A conference room.
Mellow greetings, Warden William Smithers.
Be well, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.
As it is a beautiful Monday morning...
...and as my duty log irrationally requires it...
...I'm hereby querying you on the prison population update.
Does the tedium continue?
Your questioning is as amusing as it is irrelevant.
The prisoners are ice cubes. They never move.
I find this lack of stimulus to be truly disappointing.
-Don't you think? -I try not to.
However, you're young. Think all you want.
Things don't happen anymore. We've taken care of all that.
I'll Fiber Op you back after the parole hearings.
Have a peachy day, lieutenant. Be well.

WOMAN: Be well, lieutenant.
Mellow greetings, Lenina Huxley.
Let me guess, all is serene?
On the contrary, it's been a horrific a.m.
Public buildings were defaced.
Walls smudged with...
...scandalous graffiti.
Really?
Brutal. Why wasn't there an all-cars notified?
Because there was no need to create widespread panic.
Lieutenant Huxley...
...I monitored your disheartening and distressing comments...
...to the warden this morning.
Do you really long for chaos and disharmony?
Your fascination with the 20th century seems to be affecting your judgment.
You realize you're setting a bad example for other officers and personnel.
Thank you for the attitude readjustment, Chief Earle.
Info assimilated.
Sanctimonious asshole.
COMPUTER: Lenina Huxley, you are fined one half credit...
...for a sotto voce violation of the verbal morality statute.
Thank you.
Phew, that was tense.
-That was tense? -Yes.
Tell me, Garcia...
...don't you get bored code-tracing perps who break curfew and tell dirty jokes?
No, I find my job deeply fulfilling.
I just cannot get over the reality of this office, Lenina Huxley.
You're still addicted to the 20th century.
High from its harshness. Buzzed by its brutality.
Holy smokes!
Is there anything in this office which doesn't violate Contraband Ordinance 22?
Only you, Alfredo Garcia.
Don't you ever want something to happen?
Goodness, no.
I knew you were gonna say that.
What I wouldn't give for some action.
Mr. Simon Phoenix.
One of our first and most illustrious members.
Allow me to welcome you to your parole hearing.
Let's get this one over quick.
Twenty-nine years ago, the parole system as you know it--
--was rendered obsolete.
Federal Statute 537-29--
Stop it!
Do you have anything fresh to say on your behalf?
I thought not.
Yeah, I do.

...or the noise pollution caused by the exploding devices.
Allow me to explain.
The real problem lies in the man whose initials...
...mark the detonating graffiti...
...on the streets of our peaceful city.
The man behind the E.F.:
Mr. Edgar Friendly.
For a sadly extended period of time...
...we in San Angeles have been plagued by a pack of subterranean hooligans.
You will come to know them as "scraps."
Men and women who have left the comfort of our society...
...only to spew hostility at the very bosom that they have relinquished.
There was a time when we used to look upon these scraps...
...as rather pathetic and relatively harmless.
Now they have a leader.
Mr. Friendly seems relentless in his ambition to infect our harmony with his venom.
He must, of course, be stopped.
This radical terrorist behavior, led by Mr. Friendly...
...must not be allowed to undermine our safety.
Safety above all.
I expect your trust, confidence and certitude.
If you'll excuse me.
Dr. Cocteau, a CryoCon has effected self-release from the penitentiary.
It's quite horrific. MurderDeathKills, all categories of chaos.

Get me Captain George Earle immediately.
It was just....
I mean, it was so....
How can a man be so blatantly sadistic?
It was fun for him.
I want you to do everything in your power to snare this agent of destruction.
You have my utmost confidence.
It will be done, Dr. Cocteau.
Be well.
"Utmost confidence."
"Everything in our power."

All authentic criminals.
There was a lot more business back then.
How can you justify destroying a $7-million mini mall...
...to rescue a girl whose ransom is only $25,000?
Fuck you, lady.
SPARTAN: Good answer.
This is your recommendation?
The Demolition Man's an animal.
He's clearly the man for a job such as this. You could reinstate him.
He's a musclebound grotesque...
...who hasn't worn a shield in 40 years.
Simon Phoenix is an old-fashioned criminal.
We need an old-fashioned cop.

This is within the powers of the police.
He can be released on limited parole and reinstated to active duty.
It's not enough to collect the '90s, you bring them back?
HUXLEY: Dr. Cocteau said everything within our power.
I can't think of a better idea.
That still doesn't mean it's a good one.
This man comes from a dissimilar method of law enforcement.
I'm not sure he's any different than Simon Phoenix himself.
HUXLEY: Detective?
Detective, I am Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.
The year is 2032.
-The reason you have been released is-- -How long have I been under?
Thirty-six years.
I had a wife.
What happened to my wife?
Her light was extinguished in the Big One of 2010.
Um, she died.
In an earthquake.
The earthquake.
I had a daughter.
I made a promise. What happened to her?
John Spartan, I am Chief of Police George Earle.
We didn't thaw you out for a family reunion.
Consider it fortunate the lieutenant even bothered to do a probe on your wife.
This is about you and the CryoCon Simon Phoenix.
What?
This morning, Simon Phoenix escaped from this cryo facility.
We've had 11 MurderDeathKills so far.
You see, we have become a society of peace...
...loving and understanding...
...and we are, quite frankly, not equipped to deal with this.
There have been no deaths of unnatural causes in San Angeles in 16 years.
Where?
The Santa Barbara-Los Angeles-San Diego Metroplex merged in 2011.
You are in the center of what used to be Los Angeles.
SPARTAN: That's great.
-You, get me a Marlboro. -Yes, of course. Right away.
What's a Marlboro?
It's a cigarette. Any cigarette.
Uh, smoking is not good for you.
It has been deemed that anything not good for you is bad.
Hence, illegal. Alcohol, caffeine, contact sports, meat--
Are you shitting me?
COMPUTER: John Spartan, you are fined one credit...
...for violation of the verbal morality statute.
What the hell is that?
COMPUTER: You are fined one credit.... -Bad language...
...chocolate, gasoline, uneducational toys and anything spicy.
Abortion is illegal, but so is pregnancy if you don't have a license.
EARLE: Caveman...
...let's finish with all the Rip Van Winkle and get moving.
A Mr. Phoenix has risen from the ashes.
Uh-huh. I tracked that dirtbag for two years...
...and when I finally bring him down, you turn me into an ice cube for my trouble.
Thanks, but no, thanks.
The conditions of your parole are full reinstatement into the S.A.P.D...
...and immediate assignment to the apprehension of Simon Phoenix.
Or...
...you can go back into cryostasis.
Not many people get a second chance, John Spartan.
-Here you go. -Will do.
Any new inforama on Simon Phoenix?
There is nothing, Lenina Huxley.
Where's your John Spartan?
He went to the bathroom. I guess he got all thawed out.
Sir, I formally convey my presence.
How you doing?
We are not used to physical-contact greetings.
OFFICER: Oh, germs.
Look, I don't know if you guys know it...
...but you're out of toilet paper.
GARCIA: Did you say toilet paper?
Oh. They used handfuls of wadded paper back in the 20th.
I'm happy that you're happy, but in place of the toilet paper...
...you've got a shelf with three seashells.
He doesn't know how to use the three seashells.
I can see how that could be confusing.
LAMB: I don't believe it. Is that you, Spartan?
No. Zach?
Zach Lamb?
What happened to you?
Ha-ha-ha. I got older.
My God, I remember when you were a snot-nosed rookie pilot.
They finally grounded me.
Shit, you were a damn good flyer.
COMPUTER: You are fined two credits for violation of the verbal morality statute.
I'll be right back.
They seem to be friends, yet he speaks to him in the most profane manner.
If you'd read my study, you'd know this is how insecure heterosexual males bonded.
I knew that.
Thanks a lot, you shit-brained, fuck-faced, ball-breaking...
-...duck-fucking pain in the ass. COMPUTER: You're fined five credits...
...for repeated violations of the verbal morality statute.
So much for the seashells.
See you in a few minutes.
COMPUTER: Waiting for command. Voice check, Lenina Huxley.
HUXLEY: Unfortunately Simon Phoenix was not coded.
While you were sleeping, everyone was installed code.
It was a brilliant idea by Dr. Cocteau that an organic microchip...
...be sewn into the skin.
Sensors all over the city can zero in on anyone at any time.
I can't even conceive what you police officers did before it was developed.
We worked for a living. This fascist crap makes me wanna puke.
What do you think you're scratching, caveman?
You really think we'd let you go without control?
Your code was implanted the second you thawed.
Why not just shove a leash up my ass?
-You dirty meat-eater! COMPUTER: You are fined....
No matter how Viking your era was...
...I cannot digest how you ever wore a badge.
You're going back, John Spartan. Oh, yes, you're going back.
Could you two please dump some hormones?
We need every cortex we can get here.
We don't need the Neanderthal.
Our computer has already examined every scenario...
...resulting from the appearance of Simon Phoenix.
It is determined he'll attempt to set up a new drug lab and form a crime syndicate.
COMPUTER: That is correct, Chief George Earle.
I hate to interrupt you two lovebirds, but that's really fucking stupid.
You think he wants to start a business?
Phoenix is going for a gun, plain and simple.
Trust me. He's going for a gun.
Who cares what this primate thinks?
Resonate some understanding.
The only place a person can even view a gun in this city...
...is at a museum.

They defrosted you just so you could lasso my piddly ass? Damn, you been had.
I've been dreaming about killing you for 40 years.
Yeah? Well, keep dreaming.
Oh, shit!
COMPUTER: Acc-Mag now reactivated.
It's about time.
Past is over, John. Time for something new and improved.
Oh, hell.
Holy shit! I love this gun! Goddamn!
How do you like me in the future, John, huh?
Come on, Phoenix. Come on!
That must have hurt.
Huh, soldier boy? Ha-ha-ha.
-You're on TV. -Oh, shit!
You're dead.
Forgot to say, "Simon says."
Oh, shit.
Good one.
Such a brave new world. Sorry you gotta go.
Shit.
Our noble facility has been desecrated by hooligans.
Someone will pay dearly for this.
Sir, the stress breeder is inside being demobilized as we speak.
PHOENIX: Shit. Being frozen must have thrown my aim off.
Don't worry, I'll get you with the next shot.
I don't think so.
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.
And you were doing so well.
Now, don't you have a job to do? Hmm?
Isn't there a thought repeating in that barbaric brain of yours?
The name Friendly.
Mr. Edgar Friendly.
Don't you have someone to kill?
-Yeah, I do. -Excellent.
Then go and do your job.
SPARTAN: Phoenix!
Shit. Saved by the bell.
Shit.
Damn.
You're lucky he didn't whack you.
I must say that whacking, whatever it is, sounds most disagreeable. Heh, heh.
Well, you scared him away.
I don't know how to thank you. You saved my life.
No problem.
Not bad for a 74-year-old.
Simon Phoenix knows he has some competition.
He's finally matched his meat.
You really licked his ass.
That's "met his match" and "kicked his ass."
Met? "Met his match and kicked his ass."
COCTEAU: Captain Earle.
Who is this man?
John Spartan, temporarily reinstated to the San Angeles Police Department...
...to pursue the CryoCon Simon Phoenix.
You told us to do everything in our power to capture him.
Oh, yes. Yes, I did. I did.
Yes, I do recall the exploits of Mr. John Spartan.
Yes. Didn't they call him--? Yes, of course. The Demolition Man.
It's quite all right, chief.
Unexpected. Creative.
But quite all right.
John Spartan, welcome.
Now, in honor of your arrival and your protection of the sanctity of human life...
...namely my own, ha, ha...
...I would like to invite you to join me to dinner tonight.
The both of you.
Please, I insist.
I would like you to accompany me...
...to Taco Bell.
Look forward to it. Thank you.
-Taco Bell? -Yes.
So let me get this right:
Spacely Sprockets here, who's now the man in charge, the mayor/gov...
...who wants to take me to dinner at Taco Bell--
Though I wouldn't mind a burrito.
--also built the goddamn cryoprison?
-John Spartan, you are fined one credit.... -Thanks.
Dr. Cocteau is the most important man in San Angeles.
He practically created our whole way of life, savage.
Yeah? Well, he can have it.
Phoenix could be anywhere, but not being coded could limit him.
Correct. Money is outmoded. All transactions are through codes.
So he can't buy food or a place to stay for the night.
It'd be a waste of time to mug somebody.
Unless he rips off someone's hand.
But with all officers patrolling in a citywide crisis net...
...should be a matter of tick-tocks before--
More importantly, we already have a backup plan.
We can just wait for another code to go red.
When Phoenix performs another MurderDeathKill...
...we'll know exactly where to pounce.
-Great plan. -Thank you.
He likes your plan, chief.
I've been an enthusiast of your escapades for quite some time.
In fact, I perused some newsreels from the Schwarzenegger Library. That time--
Hold it.
The Schwarzenegger Library?
Yes, the Schwarzenegger Presidential Library.
Wasn't he an actor when--?
-Stop. He was president? -Yes.
Even though he wasn't a native, his popularity caused the 61st Amendment--
I don't want to know.
President.
What the hell is this? No door? No welcome mat?
What is this?
What kind of people are these? How do they expect you to kill somebody?
Oh, shit, I love that smell. Reminds me of biscuits and gravy.
All right. A job is a job.
Edgar Friendly, whoever the fuck you are, prepare for Simon Phoenix.
So, what's with this Cocteau guy anyway?
He says I saved his life, which I'm not sure I did.
My reward is dinner and dancing at Taco Bell?
I mean, hey, I like Mexican food, but come on.
Your tone is quasi-facetious, but you do not realize...
...Taco Bell was the only restaurant to survive the Franchise Wars.
So?
So now all restaurants are Taco Bell.
No way.
Welcome to Taco Bell.
Enjoy your meal, sir.
[SINGING] Valley of the Jolly Green Giant
Good things from the garden
Garden in the valley Valley of the Jolly Green Giant
WOMAN: Be well.
I'll take that.
Oh. Here comes the Neanderthal.
Mr. Spartan, over there, please, and lieutenant....
Thank you. Would you...?
-Yes. HUXLEY: Hi.
-How are you guys doing? MAN: Mellow, thank you.
COCTEAU: Fine. Yes.
WAITER: Enjoy-joy your meal, sir.
Good thing I'm hungry.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to ask you to raise your glasses...
...to the hero of the hour, my savior...
...Detective John Spartan.
ALL: John Spartan.
Appreciate it.
Greetings and salutations.
I'm Associate Bob.
We met before, ever so briefly. I was groveling in fear at the time.
You got the salt over there, Bob?
Um, salt is not good for you, hence it is ille--
So, John Spartan, tell me...
...what do you think of San Angeles, 2032?
Considering the way things were going when I went in...
...I thought the future would be a writhing cesspool.
You weren't here when the real disturbances began.
Civilization tried to destroy itself.
The city degenerated into a total fear zone.
The citizenry at home, afraid to go out. People just wanted the madness over.
So when I saw the chance to make things right, I seized it.
If I had not, the radiance of San Angeles would not be here.
Just your rotting cesspool of hate and suffering. Which would you prefer?
Can you book me a flight out of here when the sermon's over?
John Spartan...
...for your crimes, you would surely have died in jail before now.
Even you must appreciate the persuasively tranquil humanity...
...of the cryoprison system.
I don't want to spoil your dinner, pal, but my cryo-sentence was no sweet lullaby.
I had feelings and I had thoughts.
A 36-year nightmare about people caught in a burning building.
You were awake? I don't think so.
I do think so.
My wife beating her fists against a block of ice that was her husband.
You were nice enough to wake me up...
...let me know everything that meant something in my life is gone.
Would have been more humane to stake me down and leave me to the fucking crows.
What would you say if I called you a brutish fossil...
...symbolic of a decayed era gratefully forgotten?
I don't know. "Thanks"?
I thought during rehabilitation, the prisoners were not conscious.
A person would go insane.
COCTEAU: The side effects of the cryo process are unavoidable.
You were found guilty of a crime.
You owed and still owe a debt to society.
-There's nothing I can do. -Yeah, there is.
-Call for backup. I'll be across the street. -Where are you going?
Bad guys about to do bad things. It's just one of those hunches.
MAN: Come on. FRIENDLY: Go for the truck.
The food's in the truck.
Grab the big bottle. Move, move, move.
You'll regret this the rest of your life. Both seconds of it.
Good night.
Get him!
What a fucking hero. Come on.
Please, don't.
SPARTAN: What the hell?
Such reckless abandonment.
Looks like there's a new shepherd in town.
That's "sheriff." Who were those guys?
COCTEAU: They're known as scraps.
Outcasts and deserters who choose to live beneath us...
...in sewers and abandoned tunnels.
They're a constant irritation to our harmony.
They're nothing but thugs and hooligans.
A society of thieves. The last remaining criminal element in the city.
But plans are in progress to purge this peril from our day.
You are even better live than on LaserDisc.
The way you paused to make a glib witticism before doing battle...
...with that scrap, and those punches--
This isn't the Wild West, okay?
The Wild West wasn't even the Wild West.
Hurting people's not a good thing.
Well, sometimes it is, but not when it's people looking for something to eat.
ANNOUNCER: San Angeles time is now 2215.
Huxley coding off.
Auto-drive.
COMPUTER: Auto-drive engaged.
Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you back there.
No need to make a de-hurtful retraction.
I've just assimilated too much contraband.
I fleshed you out as some "blow up the bad guy with a happy grin" he-man type.
But now I realize that you're the "moody troubled-past gunslinger...
...who will only draw when he must" type.
-Huxley, stop. -What?
I just do my job and things get--
Demolished.
I look around and I think of my daughter growing up in a place like this.
I'm afraid she's gonna think I'm a primitive.
As much as I want to see her, I almost don't want to.
Because I don't think I'll fit in to the picture very well.
Not very well at all.
It would be a misuse of police powers, but I can do a search for you.
SPARTAN: No.
Sorry.
Subject change. I got what you wanted.
Oh, great.
What do you need that for?
It's just one of those cop hunches again.
COCTEAU: Lights.
PHOENIX: No. I've changed that.
Illuminate.
Deluminate.
Hoo! Isn't that nicer?
Go ahead, you try it.
Illuminate.
Raymond, Raymond, we've got to talk.
How did you get in?
Wish I knew. I got pass codes.
Routes to underground kingdoms.
Complete access to the industrial data-grid interface.
I don't even know what that shit means.
I've been meaning to ask you, because I like it.
I like it a lot.
Your skills have been given to you for a reason.
Not for your personal amusement.
Your job is to kill Mr. Edgar Friendly and stop a revolution before it precipitates.
That was why you were rehabilitated.
All right. I'm gonna do your little dastardly deed for you.
But it's gonna be a little bit more difficult than you thought.
And I'm gonna need some help.
I'll need about five or six more special men.
And I just so happen to have a list.
I wouldn't want you to defrost any of those killer types, know what I mean?
And none of those motherfuckers from New York. They're too uptight.
So you're going to be the only killer type, right?
Exactamundo.
Fine.
Take care of it.
Just get it over with.
You're more trouble than you're worth.
Oh, Raymond, don't say that.
And what do I get out of all this?
What do you want?
Malibu.
Santa Monica. Hell, what about all the coastal cities? Ha-ha-ha.
Well, I'll bear it in mind.
-Good, I'll send you a memo. -Just do your job!
What is John Spartan doing here? Huh?
Did you invite him to this little party of ours?
Look, you finish your business and I'll stuff him back in the freezer.
Think of him as a guarantee.
A guarantee?
You don't have much of a guarantee.
I took care of Spartan once, I'll take care of him again.
Now we need those men defrosted.
SPARTAN: So this is where you live?
Very not bad.
HUXLEY: Thank you.
SPARTAN: So where will I be staying?
HUXLEY: I've procured you a domicile right down the corridor from my own.
Everything is voice coded, so if you need something, just ask.
Lights.
What do you think?
Clicked off a lot of credits to create a 20th-century apartment.
Huxley, it's very....
-Isn't it? -Ha-ha-ha.
John Spartan...
...there is, of course, a well-known and documented connection... ...between sex and violence.
...between sex and violence.
Not so much a causal effect, but a general state of neurological arousal.
And after having observed your behavior this evening...
...and my resultant condition...
...I was wondering if you would like to have sex.
-With you? -Mm-hm.
-Here? Heh, heh. Now? -Mm-hm.
Oh, yeah.
Great! Ha, ha.
I'll be right back.
Love Boat?
Okay.
There you go.
Now, just relax. We'll begin in a few seconds.
Begin what?
Having sex, of course.
Yes. Yes. Yes!
What's wrong? You broke contact.
Contact? I didn't even touch you yet.
But I thought you wanted to make love.
Is that what you call this?
Vir-sex produces high alpha waves during transference of sexual energies.
Huxley, let's do it the old-fashioned way.
Ew! Disgusting!
You mean...
...fluid transfer?
No, I mean boning, the wild mambo, the hunka-chunka.
That is no longer done.
Exchange of bodily fluids, know what that leads to?
Yeah, I do. Kids, smoking, a desire to raid the fridge.
Rampant exchange of bodily fluids was one of the major reasons...
...for the downfall of society.
After AIDS, there was NRS. After NRS, there was UBT.
One of the first things Dr. Cocteau did was to outlaw... ...and engineer all fluid transfer out of societally acceptable behavior.
...and engineer all fluid transfer out of societally acceptable behavior.
Not even mouth transfer is condoned.
-Kissing's not allowed? -Ugh!
Damn, I was a good kisser.
What about kids?
-Procreation? -Yeah.
We go to a lab.
Fluids are purified, screened...
...and transferred by authorized medical personnel only.
It is the only legal way.
What are you doing?
Breaking the law.
You are a savage creature, John Spartan.
I wish you to leave my domicile now.
Look, you know--
COMPUTER: Code accepted. Be well, John Spartan.
Lights.
"He doesn't know how to use the three seashells."
Happy Halloween.
"Behavioral engineering"?
Hi, Martin, I was thinking-- Oh, my God, I'm sorry, wrong number.
COCTEAU: Our noble facility has been desecrated by hooligans.
Someone will pay dearly for this.
Sir, the stress breeder is inside being demobilized as we speak.
PHOENIX: Shit. Being frozen must have thrown my aim off.
Don't worry, I'll get you with the next shot.
COCTEAU: I don't think so.
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.
-Detective. -Listen, I'm sorry about last night.
Here, I made this for you.
-For me? -Yeah.
Thank you.
Oh, I'll drive.
-I gotta learn to do this once in my life. -Okay.
Thank you for the lovely gift.
I don't know what you guys put into my cryo sludge.
When I thawed out, first thing I wanted to do was knit.
How come I know what a zipperfoot, a shuttle, a bobbin and a petit point is?
I could weave a throw rug right now with my eyes closed.
Ha, ha. It's part of your rehab program.
For each inmate, the computer draws up a skill or trade...
...suited to their genetic disposition.
And it would implant the knowledge and the desire...
...to carry out whatever training was assigned.
I'm a seamstress?
Oh, that's just great.
I come out of cryoprison and I'm Betsy fucking Ross.
Phoenix can access computers, operate all vehicles...
...knows the location of everything in town...
...and is stronger than when he went in?
-Can you get me his rehab program now? -Sure.
-I'm a seamstress. -Access code for Simon Phoenix.
COMPUTER: Access Simon Phoenix.
Accessing.
Access denied.
HUXLEY: What? -Security override.
This can't be right.
Access granted, Officer Huxley.
Accessing Simon Phoenix, Deepfile rehab 65-R.
Urban Combatkill. Torture Methodology. Computer Override Authority.
There must be some mistake.
Terrorism Tactics. Weapons Training. Martial Arts. MurderDeathKill.
Explosives Technician. Violent Behavior.
-This isn't a rehab program. -No kidding.
This would create a monster.
-Who develops these programs? -Cocteau Industries, of course.
But why would the benevolent Dr. Cocteau send such a brute savage into our midst?
Good question. Let's go ask him.
No. You do not accuse a savior of our city...
...of being connected with a multi-MurderDeathKiller like Phoenix. It's...
...rude.
I'll be subtle.
I'm good at subtle.
COCTEAU [ON RECORDING]: Mellow greetings.
We are happy to welcome you to the Cocteau Behavioral Engineering Complex.
Be well.
-Enhance your calm, John Spartan. -Mm.
COCTEAU: Mellow apologies for my lack of physical disposition, detective...
...but I have a city/gov to run.
Well, run this.
You programmed Phoenix's rehab to turn him into a terrorist.
And I don't think his escape was an accident.
-Very subtle. -Thank you.
Outside the museum, why didn't he blow your brains out? What did you say to him?
I honestly don't remember. Does it matter?
It matters. I saw the security disk.
He had 10 seconds to figure out where to put the hole in your fucking head.
This display of barbaric behavior was unacceptable even in your time.
Yeah. But it worked.
When a man like Phoenix has a gun to your head...
...10 seconds is 9 and a half seconds longer than you live.
Not everyone is as eager as you to resort to violence to solve life's difficulties.
Even now, I'm beginning to wonder if the chaos in the museum...
...was the result of Mr. Phoenix's presence or your own.
Wonder about this, shithead.
If you think you got this maniac under control, trust me, you don't.
Is there something specific you plan to do with that archaic device?
John Spartan.
No, I didn't think so.
Detective, the only thing I haven't got under control is you.
But that can be solved.
You, my Cro-Magnon friend, are dead.
Your family's dead, your past is dead.
Dead things cannot affect the living.
So enjoy your moment of prehistoric bravado...
...because after you leave here, it will be over.
Like everything else in your life.
Officer, return this man to cryostasis immediately.
Be well.
Be fucked.
COMPUTER: You are fined one--
COMPUTER: Greetings, citizen. How are you on this glorious day?
LAMB: I'll wait here. -Let's go.
-I don't know. -I do know. Turn that thing on.
LAMB: I hope you know what you're doing. COMPUTER: Vector, 23 degrees.
You're asking me to disobey a direct order. I'm to escort you to the cryoprison.
Do what you got to. I gotta nail that maniac and put him on ice or that's where I'll be.
-Enhance your calm. -I've had it with enhancing my calm.
I'm gonna find that psycho and enhance his calm.
When I'm done, I'm gonna turn all my attention to that Froot Loop, Cocteau.
You don't have to come with me. I'll do it alone. Okay?
Even if Simon Phoenix was programmed to escape, extinguish life and steal...
...why are you going to the wasteland?
Your city-wide manhunt didn't work, because Phoenix was in the one place that...
...A, you can't monitor...
...B, are afraid to go and, C, don't give a shit about.
I wanna go down there, find Phoenix and put him in a hurt locker.
So you wanna come with me or you wanna arrest me, huh?
Okay. I'm with you.
Let's go blow this guy.
Away. Blow this guy away.
Whatever.
Got a way with words.
SPARTAN: What's wrong, Huxley? -It's not very clean.
A real garden spot.
All right, which way?
GARCIA: Over there.
SPARTAN: All right, guys, be ready for anything.
[SINGING] My dog's better than your dog
My dog's better than yours
My dog's better 'cause he gets Ken-L Ration My dog's--
Hey.
I'm sorry, but when I'm nervous, I....
Sorry.
Over here.
What is that emanation?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Come on, guys.
No, hey, just relax. All I want is a burger and a beer, if you got one.
How am I gonna pay?
-Huxley, it is better to give.... -Ow!
-Want a slug? -Ugh.
No, thank you.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, God.
-This is fantastic. You guys gotta try one. -Oh, my.
Just don't ask where the meat comes from.
What's that supposed to mean?
Do you see any cows around here?
Rat?
This is a rat burger?
Not bad.
Matter of fact, it's the best burger I've had in years.
See you later.
They don't seem very hostile, John Spartan.
No, they don't.
Now, that's a thing of beauty.
Do you know what this is?
A 1970 Oldsmobile 442.
With a 455-cubic-inch engine.
Radial tires and bucket seats.
-I'm impressed. -I studied.
So did I. Hand over the glow-rod.
Your friends too. Come on, move.
MAN 1: Easy, pal. MAN 2: Yeah.
You got ball-balls, coming down here after the show you put on.
We're looking for a MurderDeathKiller.
Can you help or just bully us with your primitive weapons?
Well, maybe they're not so primitive.
Think you're taking me in?
Guess what. Not happening.
You tell Cocteau he can kiss my ass. Yeah, that's right.
It'll take an army to get rid of me.
I don't give a shit. I got nothing to lose.
Pal, I don't know who the hell you are, let alone want to take you anywhere.
So stay here, be well and Cocteau's an asshole!
-Hey! MAN 3: Hey, man.
MAN 4: Let's dump them up top. They're only here to spy on us.
Wait a minute.
You're the guy outside Taco Bell.
Yeah. What do you want?
You weren't part of the Cocteau plan.
Greed, deception, abuse of power. That's no plan.
-That's why everybody's down here? -Got that right.
See, according to Cocteau's plan...
...I'm the enemy, because I like to think.
I like to read. I'm into freedom of speech and choice.
I'm the kind of guy who likes to sit in a greasy spoon and wonder:
"Should I have steak or jumbo barbecued ribs with gravy fries?"
I want high cholesterol. I want to eat bacon, butter and buckets of cheese.
I want to smoke a Cuban cigar the size of Cincinnati.
I want to run through the streets naked with Jell-O all over my body...
...reading Playboy Magazine, because I might feel the need to.
I've seen the future.
It's a 47-year-old virgin in his pajamas...
...drinking a banana-broccoli shake, singing, "I'm a wiener."
Up top, you live Cocteau's way.
What he wants, when he wants, how he wants.
Your other choice: come down here.
Maybe starve to death.
Why don't you take charge and lead these people out of here?
I'm no leader.
I do what I have to do. Sometimes people come with me.
I just want to bury Cocteau up to his neck in shit and let him think happy thoughts.
Then I got bad news.
I think he wants to kill you.
All right, gentlemen, let's review.
The year is 2032.
That's 2-0-3-2. As in the 21st century.
And I'm sorry to say that the world has become a pussy-whipped...
...Brady Bunch version of itself run by a bunch of robed sissies.
All we have to do to run the whole thing...
...is to kill a man named Friendly, who put it all together.
Ah, but there's an extra added bonus.
We get to kill the man who put most of us behind the freezer.
You mean we get to kill John Spartan?
Exactly.
I want you to loot, pillage, plunder. I want you to steal.
Do all the wonderful things we used to do before all of this happened.
This world will be ours.
Let's bring back the good old days!
-Are you with me? ALL: Yeah!
-Are you with me? Let's do it! ALL: Yeah!
Yeah!
It is a curious conclusion which you have deduced, John Spartan.
But I can find no fault in your logic.
Simon Phoenix is the perfect weapon...
...to send to the savage nether regions in which we stand.
I am impressed, John Spartan.
You mean they thawed this guy out just to kill me?
-I'm flattered. -Don't be flattered. Be frightened.
This guy's a certifiable nightmare.
FRIENDLY: That's why you're down here? SPARTAN: Yeah.
I must have done something right in a previous life.
Can't imagine what that could have been.
Two for the price of one.
Let's take them, boys.
Stay down!
Friendly! Up on top!
I'll be goddamned. Like a New York cockroach.
Fuck it.
I hate when things go wrong.
Phoenix!
There's an elevator shaft on top of this place.
Does that mean we're going up?
Come on.
How nice. They must have been expecting me.
Okay. Now what?
Buckle up.
HUXLEY: There he is! He's in my car!
I'll be goddamned.
What is happening with the cops today?
Don't you know you're endangering civilians?
Shit.
-Auto-inflate. COMPUTER: Auto-inflate.
-Ha-ha-ha. -Damn.
Oh, that is just lovely.
Huxley, drive.
Okay, I've read all about this. Now, okay.
So, what do I do? I just push this pedal?
Whoa! Okay, okay. I got it, I got it.
-Punch it! -Excuse me?
Push the pedal as hard as you can! Just catch up to him!
-Hold on. -Faster!
Faster!
Shit.
No free rides!
-Emergency, doors open. -Doors opening.
Say hello to my little friend.
-Doors close. -Malfunction.
Computer, auto-drive.
Auto-drive engaged.
Gonna give you a haircut!
Remember those 40 bus passengers that you blew apart trying to catch me?
They were already dead.
Cold as Häagen-Dazs.
Man, I went to jail with a 36-year smile.
You're dead, Spartan.
Speak for yourself.
-Self-drive. -Unable to execute.
-Self-drive now. -Malfunction.
Unable to execute.
Emergency.
Go left. Right.
Self-drive engaged.
Brake. Brake.
Brake now, you Mickey Mouse piece of shit!
John Spartan? John Spartan, are you in there?
-John Spartan! SPARTAN: Who do you think it is, Huxley?
Here.
I thought your life force had been prematurely terminated.
Yeah, I thought I was history too.
What the hell happened? All of a sudden, this car turned into a cannoli.
It's securefoam, and it saved your life.
Look at you, you're in shambles.
Don't worry, I can fix it later. All I need is a needle and thread.
I really didn't say that, did I?
Damn!
John Spartan.
You caveman, you're under arrest.
You are to be returned to the cryoprison immediately.
I heard all about that. We'll talk later, chief.
I need something, anything. A shotgun, a flare gun.
Spartan.
-Holy shit. EARLE: Defensive red alert.
Stun batons on.
Relax.
Look at you. You get a bump on the noggin and think you're Pancho Villa?
-Who? -Never mind.
Time to take a stand, pal.
Well, good. While you're doing it, loan me a gun. Loan me two guns.
You'd use these weapons of mass destruction...
...against men and women who uphold the law?
We use these weapons to shop for groceries, dick.
EARLE: Spartan, wait.
You can't leave.
You're under arrest. This very concept negates the possibility of your leaving.
Skip it, chief.
Lieutenant Huxley.
Chief, you can take this job and you can shovel it.
"Take this job and shovel it."
Yeah?
Close enough.
No. No.
I hadn't counted on this, but I must say, you worked out beautifully.
People are terrified of you.
What's new? People have always been terrified of me.
Yes, but this time, they're really intimidated.
Now I'll have carte blanche to create the perfect society.
My society.
San Angeles will be a beacon of order...
...with the purity of an ant colony.
And the beauty of a flawless pearl.
You can't take away people's right to be assholes.
That's who you remind me of...
...an evil Mr. Rogers.
Will you please kill him?
He's pissing me off.
Put another log on the fire!
I'm gonna love running this place.
Well, now...
...what shall I do with you, huh, Bobby?
I am an excellent associate, sir.
I would be delighted to continue my services during your administration.
Ah. Maybe we'll use him.
BOB: Excuse me, the police are here.
Who in the hell do you think--?
I'm impressed.
Huxley!
That man has died by my hands.
It was either him or us, Huxley.
Yeah, there is that.
Where'd you learn to kick like that?
-Oh, um, Jackie Chan movies. -Ah.
Looks like the Cocteau plan just went up in smoke.
Rest in peace, Raymond Cocteau.
Oh, John Spartan, civilization as we know it will come to an end.
What will we do?
I don't know. But trust me, this is better for you.
What's that?
This is bad.
This is very bad.
He's accessed the cryoprison and he's about to defrost the entire multi-lifer wing.
Most of them don't like you.
Most of these guys don't even like their own mothers. These are bad boys.
How many are there?
Eighty. All without rehab.
They'll be reanimated within the hour.
We gotta stop this.
I'm not at all pleased about having caused the fatality of that deranged CryoCon.
But I now understand that under certain circumstances, violence is necessary.
Good.
Then I hope you understand this.
PHOENIX: Oh, I hope my butt didn't look like that.
Okay, who do we have left that's good?
Let's see.
Wilkes, Patrick.
Jeffrey Dahmer? I love that guy.
We gotta get him. How long before they're done?
-They're in the final stages of reanimation. PHOENIX: Great. Absolutely great.
Gentlemen.
Thank you very much, but your services will no longer be required.
Send a maniac to catch a maniac.
COMPUTER: Attention. Attention.
Cryoprisoner defrosting reanimation sequence...
...now entering final stage.
Countdown to reanimation of prisoner batches...
...290, 310, 480 and 570:
Ten minutes.
BOB: That's it. The very last one. PHOENIX: Excellent.
COMPUTER: Accessed.
What the hell is that?
Phoenix!
Didn't expect that one, did you?
Where are you going?
I wish you the best of luck, sir.
Stupid.
Spartan, how's it hanging, huh?
I'm sure you're familiar with the long arm of the law, aren't you?
Why don't you struggle a little bit? Make me work for it.
What do you say? How about a little target practice? What do you say?
Didn't hurt your head, did you?
Shit. Piece-of-shit gun. Damn.
Fuck.
That's it, Spartan.
You're not getting out of this one.
I could drop you in that vat of defrost over there...
...and fry your ass like a chicken.
Or with my little pinky, drop your monkey ass down--
I'll be goddamned.
Shit! Goddamn! What am I doing wrong?
COMPUTER: Cryoprisoner reanimation sequence now entering final stage.
Is it cold in here, or is it just me?
Good memory.
Come here. Come here.
Piece of shit!
I hate cops!
Look in my eyes, John. I'll see you in hell.
This is the best day of my life.
SPARTAN: Heads up!
EARLE: You have apprehended the villain responsible for murdering Cocteau?
I wouldn't exactly say apprehended. Let's just say he's history.
And the cryoprison, that's history too.
What will we do? How will we live?
We're all gonna go out drinking, get shit-faced and paint the town, literally.
Put up graffiti, slogans. It'll be a blast.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'll tell you what you're gonna do.
Why don't you get a little dirty?
You, a lot clean.
And somewhere in the middle....
I don't know. You'll figure it out.
Fucking A.
Well put.
Mr. Friendly? Greetings and salutations, Edgar Friendly.
I'm Associate Bob. And may I say...
...it would be a pleasure to assist you in creating a more humane--
-Bob. Bob. Let's talk about the hair, okay? -Hair?
Pick a color. And lose the kimono.
-You look like a couch. BOB: A couch?
FRIENDLY: Are you a surgeon with these gloves?
Thank you for rendering me unconscious.
I did it for your own good.
-We're supposed to be a team. -We are.
Oh, my. Heh.
Are all fluid-transfer activities like this?
-Better. -Better?
Oh, my.
I think I'm gonna like the future.
Now that you've demolished everything.
OK. YOUR LEG WILL BE FINE. A LOT OF SHRAPNEL CAME OUT.
I SAVED YOU THE PIECES.
YOU ARE THE PRETTIEST GIRL I'VE EVER SEEN. I DON'T THINK SO. HERE.
WOULD YOU KISS ME? NO. I'LL GET YOU SOME TEA.
IT'D MEAN SUCH A LOT TO ME.
WOULD IT?
THANK YOU.
NURSE, I CAN'T SLEEP. WOULD YOU KISS ME?
YOU'RE SO PRETTY! WILL YOU TUCK ME IN, PLEASE?
VERY FUNNY! GO TO SLEEP NOW.
DON'T ASK.
GOD, I HATE GIVING BLOOD. I CAN'T STAND NEEDLES.
IS THERE ANYBODY FROM PICTON?
PICTON? I DON'T KNOW.
I'D LIKE TO SEE SOMEBODY FROM HOME BEFORE I GO.
DO WE HAVE ANYBODY FROM PICTON?
WHY PICTON?
WHY PICTON? HE'S FROM THERE. EDGE OF LAKE ONTARIO, RIGHT, SOLDIER?
THAT'S WHERE YOUR SWEETIE'S FROM, ISN'T IT? AROUND THERE?
ASK HIM WHAT COMPANY HE'S WITH.
THIRD CANADIAN FUSILIERS. THIRD CANADIAN FUSILIERS.
DOES HE KNOW CAPTAIN McGANN? HE BOUGHT IT YESTERDAY. SHOT TO BITS.
HE BOUGHT IT YESTERDAY. SHOT TO BITS.
WHAT DID HE SAY? HE DOESN'T KNOW HIM.
HANA, GET DOWN!
Officer: COMPANY, TAKE COVER!
[SOBBING] HE'S DEAD. HE'S DEAD.
HE'S DEAD.
HE'S DEAD.
NO.
Officer: NAME, RANK, SERIAL NUMBER.
NO, SORRY. I THINK I WAS A PILOT.
I WAS FOUND IN THE WRECKAGE OF A PLANE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR.
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR.
CAN YOU REMEMBER WHERE YOU WERE BORN? AM I BEING INTERROGATED?
YOU SHOULD BE TRYING TO TRICK ME. MAKE ME SPEAK GERMAN,
WHICH I CAN, BY THE WAY. WHY? ARE YOU GERMAN?
WHY? ARE YOU GERMAN?
NO.
HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GERMAN IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING?
M-MIGHT I HAVE A SIP OF WATER?
THANK YOU.
IT'S OK. I REMEMBER LOTS OF THINGS.
I REMEMBER HER GARDEN PLUNGING DOWN TO THE SEA,
NOTHING BETWEEN YOU AND FRANCE. THIS WAS YOUR GARDEN?
OR MY WIFE'S. YOU WERE MARRIED THEN?
I THINK SO. ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE
I THINK SO. ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE OF A NUMBER OF GERMANS.
LOOK...
I HAVE THIS MUCH LUNG.
THE REST OF MY ORGANS ARE PACKING UP.
WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY MATTER IF I'M A TUTANKHAMEN?
I'M A BIT OF...TOAST, MY FRIEND.
SORRY, I CAN'T HELP YOU.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I KNOW YOU HATE TO BE MOVED. I'M SORRY.
HANA!
JAN!
HANA! HANA!
THERE'S MEANT TO BE LACE IN THE NEXT VILLAGE.
THE BOYS ARE GONNA TAKE ME. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY, DO YOU?
NOPE. JUST IN CASE THERE'S SILK.
NO! HANA, I KNOW YOU DO. COME ON!
NO! OH, COME ON!
I SWEAR TO GOD THIS'LL BE THE LAST TIME. I SWEAR. SHE'S A SOFTY. SHE LOVES ME.
I SWEAR. SHE'S A SOFTY. SHE LOVES ME.
I'LL PAY YOU BACK. I PROMISE!
I'M NOT SEWING ANYTHING ELSE FOR YOU!
I LOVE YOU! MWAH!
WHOA! CAREFUL, BOYS!
GET SOME WATER OVER HERE!
JAN. OH, NO.
HANA, WHERE YOU GOING?
STAY BACK! STOP, HANA!
STAY!
NO!
NO!
HEY! HEY!
DON'T MOVE! STAND ABSOLUTELY STILL!
YOU'RE WALKING IN A MINEFIELD!
GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.
JUST STAY STILL FOR ME.
YOU'LL BE FINE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT THE BLOODY HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!
Hana: IT'S JAN'S.
ARE YOU IN PAIN? DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?
YES. OK.
ARE YOU OK? YOU AND JAN WERE--
WE KEEP MOVING HIM IN AND OUT OF THE TRUCK. WHY?
HE'S DYING. WHAT'S THE POINT?
WELL, WE CAN HARDLY LEAVE HIM.
DO YOU MEAN LEAVE HIM?
NO, NO, I DON'T MEAN LEAVE HIM.
THIS WILL HELP YOU.
I MUST BE A CURSE.
ANYBODY WHO LOVES ME...
ANYBODY WHO GETS CLOSE TO ME...
OR I MUST BE CURSED.
WHICH IS IT?
WHEN HE DIES, I'LL CATCH UP.
IT'S NOT SAFE HERE. THE WHOLE COUNTRY'S CRAWLING WITH BANDITS
IT'S NOT SAFE HERE. THE WHOLE COUNTRY'S CRAWLING WITH BANDITS AND GERMANS AND GOD KNOWS WHAT.
IT'S MADNESS. I CAN'T ALLOW IT. THE WAR IS OVER. HOW CAN IT BE DESERTION?
IT'S NOT OVER EVERYWHERE. I DIDN'T MEAN LITERALLY.
THIS IS NORMAL. IT'S SHOCK. FOR ALL OF US. HANA--
I NEED MORPHINE. A LOT. AND A PISTOL.
IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED TO YOU, I'D NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF.
[SIGHS] WE'RE HEADING FOR LEGHORN. LIVORNO THE ITALIANS CALL IT.
WE'LL EXPECT YOU.
FINE.
THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME, MA'AM.
OH, HANA. I'LL BE OK. I'LL CATCH UP.
I'LL BE OK. I'LL CATCH UP.
GOOD.
WHAT--WHAT WAS ALL THAT BANGING?
WERE YOU--WERE YOU FIGHTING RATS OR THE ENTIRE GERMAN ARMY?
HEH! NO.
I WAS REPAIRING THE STAIRS.
I FOUND A LIBRARY,
AND THE BOOKS WERE VERY USEFUL.
BEFORE YOU FIND TOO MANY USES FOR THOSE BOOKS,
YOU MIGHT READ SOME TO ME.
I THINK THEY'RE ALL IN ITALIAN, BUT I'LL LOOK, YES.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR OWN BOOK?
MY BOOK? OH, YES.
THE HEROTODUS.
YES, YOU CAN READ HIM.
OH! I FOUND PLUMS.
WE HAVE PLUMS IN THE ORCHARD.
HERE. WE HAVE AN ORCHARD.
HEROTODUS WAS THE FATHER OF HISTORY.
DO YOU KNOW THAT? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
IT'S A--IT'S A VERY...
PLUM PLUM.
A MOUNTAIN THE SHAPE OF A WOMAN'S BACK.
GOOD, GOOD.
HELLO, GEOFFREY!
WELCOME! MADOX!
WELCOME TO THE EXPEDITION. HOW DO YOU? GEOFFREY CLIFTON.
HOW DO YOU? GEOFFREY CLIFTON. SPLENDID TO FINALLY MEET YOU ALL.
THIS IS DANTE D'AGOSTINO AND DICKY BERMANN, OUR ARCHEOLOGISTS,
AND DICKY BERMANN, OUR ARCHEOLOGISTS, AND THIS IS SHARIF A'FOUAD, EGYPTOLOGIST.
AND THIS IS MY WIFE KATHARINE. HELLO! HELLO.
WE'RE YOUR NEW APPRENTICES. Fouad: WELCOME TO THE INTERNATIONAL SAND CLUB.
TO THE INTERNATIONAL SAND CLUB. I'LL GET CUPS.
MARVELOUS PLANE. DID YOU LOOK?
YES. ISN'T IT? IT'S A WEDDING PRESENT FROM KATHARINE'S PARENTS.
WE'RE CALLING IT RUPERT BEAR.
HELLO. GEOFFREY CLIFTON. ALMASY.
WE CAN FINALLY CONSIGN MY OLD BIRD TO THE SCRAP HEAP.
HEH! MRS. CLIFTON, I'D LIKE TO PRESENT COUNT ALMASY.
HELLO. GEOFFREY GAVE ME YOUR MONOGRAPH
HELLO. GEOFFREY GAVE ME YOUR MONOGRAPH WHEN I WAS READING UP ON THE DESERT. VERY IMPRESSIVE.
WHEN I WAS READING UP ON THE DESERT. VERY IMPRESSIVE. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. I WANTED TO MEET THE MAN WHO COULD WRITE SUCH A LONG PAPER WITH SO FEW ADJECTIVES.
WELL, A THING IS STILL A THING NO MATTER WHAT YOU PLACE IN FRONT OF IT.
BIG CAR, SLOW CAR,
CHAUFFEUR-DRIVEN CAR. Geoffrey: BROKEN CAR.
STILL A CAR. NOT MUCH USE, THOUGH.
LOVE? ROMANTIC LOVE, PLATONIC LOVE, FILIAL LOVE.
QUITE DIFFERENT THINGS, SURELY. UXORIOUSNESS. THAT'S MY FAVORITE KIND OF LOVE.
UXORIOUSNESS. THAT'S MY FAVORITE KIND OF LOVE. EXCESSIVE LOVE OF ONE'S WIFE.
NOW, THERE YOU HAVE ME.
THEY'RE TOURISTS. ABSOLUTE ROT. THEY'RE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
ABSOLUTE ROT. THEY'RE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY.
SHE'S CHARMING AND HAS READ EVERYTHING.
HE'S MEANT TO BE A RUDDY GOOD FLYER. WELL, WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER PILOT.
HE CAN MAKE AERIAL MAPS OF THE WHOLE ROUTE.
YOU CAN'T EXPLORE FROM THE AIR, MADOX. IF YOU COULD EXPLORE FROM THE AIR,
IF YOU COULD EXPLORE FROM THE AIR, LIFE WOULD BE VERY SIMPLE.
CONTACT.
CONTACT.
I SHOULD TRY AND MOVE THE BED.
I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE VIEW.
IT'S GOOD. IT'S THE VIEW FROM A MONASTERY.
I CAN ALREADY SEE.
HOW? HOW CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING?
HOW? HOW CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING? NO, NO, NOT THE WINDOW.
I CAN'T BEAR THE LIGHT, ANYWAY.
I CAN SEE ALL THE WAY TO THE DESERT.
I'M TURNING YOU. AN EXPLORER BEFORE THE WAR, MAKING MAPS.
IS THERE SAND IN MY EYES?
ARE YOU CLEANING SAND FROM MY EARS? NO SAND. THAT'S YOUR MORPHINE SPEAKING.
NO SAND. THAT'S YOUR MORPHINE SPEAKING.
I CAN SEE MY WIFE IN THAT VIEW.
ARE YOU REMEMBERING MORE?
COULD I HAVE A CIGARETTE? ARE YOU CRAZY?
WHY--WHY ARE YOU SO DETERMINED
TO KEEP ME ALIVE?
BECAUSE I'M A NURSE.
Fouad: BRAVO! Katharine: GEOFFREY!
Madox: NEXT! Geoffrey: KATHARINE!
Hana: "THE KING INSISTED THAT HE WOULD FIND "SOME WAY TO PROVE BEYOND DISPUTE
"THAT HIS WIFE WAS FAIREST OF ALL WOMEN.
"I WILL HIDE YOU IN THE ROOM WHERE WE SLEEP, SAID CANDALES-- SAID CONDALESS--"
SAID CANDALES-- SAID CONDALESS--" CANDAULES.
CANDAULES.
CANDAULES.
CANDAULES TELLS GYGES THAT THE QUEEN HAS THE SAME PRACTICE EVERY NIGHT.
SHE TAKES OFF HER CLOTHES AND PUTS THEM ON THE CHAIR
BY THE DOOR TO HER ROOM.
"AND FROM WHERE YOU STAND,
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GAZE ON HER AT YOUR LEISURE."
AND THAT EVENING IT'S EXACTLY AS THE KING HAS TOLD HIM.
SHE GOES TO THE CHAIR, REMOVES HER CLOTHES ONE BY ONE,
UNTIL SHE'S STANDING NAKED IN FULL VIEW OF GYGES.
AND INDEED, SHE WAS MORE LOVELY THAN HE COULD HAVE IMAGINED.
BUT THEN THE QUEEN LOOKED UP,
AND SAW GYGES CONCEALED IN THE SHADOWS.
AND ALTHOUGH SHE SAID NOTHING, SHE SHUDDERED.
AND THE NEXT DAY
SHE SENDS FOR GYGES AND CHALLENGED HIM,
AND HEARING HIS STORY, THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID-- OFF WITH HIS HEAD.
SHE SAID, "EITHER YOU MUST SUBMIT TO DEATH "FOR GAZING ON THAT WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT,
"OR ELSE KILL MY HUSBAND WHO HAS SHAMED ME
AND BECOME KING IN HIS PLACE."
SO GYGES KILLS THE KING,
MARRIES THE QUEEN, AND BECOMES RULER OF LYDIA FOR 28 YEARS.
THE END.
SHALL I SPIN THE BOTTLE?
Madox: SO, GEOFFREY, LET THAT BE A LESSON TO YOU.
Geoffrey: HA HA HA! Katharine: D'AGOSTINO.
Hana: ARE YOU ASLEEP?
YES.
NO. I'M DROPPING OFF.
GO AWAY! GO! GO!
BUON GIORNO.
HANA?
WHAT DO YOU WANT? I MET YOUR FRIEND MARY.
SHE SAID I SHOULD STOP AND SEE IF YOU WERE ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU WERE ALL RIGHT. APPARENTLY WE'RE NEIGHBORS.
MY HOUSE IS 2 BLOCKS FROM YOURS IN MONTREAL.
CABOT, NORTH OF LAURIER.
BONJOUR.
FOR YOU. I'D LIKE TO TAKE CREDIT FOR IT,
FOR YOU. I'D LIKE TO TAKE CREDIT FOR IT, BUT IT'S FROM MARY.
MY NAME IS DAVID CARAVAGGIO, BUT NOBODY EVER CALLED ME DAVID.
CARAVAGGIO THEY FIND TOO ABSURD TO MISS OUT ON.
OH! OH, SHIT. STUPID HANDS.
STUPID HANDS. LET ME DO THAT.
THEY'RE FRESH.
I HAVEN'T HAD AN EGG IN...
HAVE YOU NOTICED THERE ARE CHICKENS?
IN ITALY, YOU GET CHICKENS, BUT NO EGGS.
IN AFRICA THERE'S ALWAYS EGGS, BUT NEVER CHICKENS.
IN AFRICA THERE'S ALWAYS EGGS, BUT NEVER CHICKENS. WHO SEPARATED THEM?
YOU WERE IN AFRICA?
YES, I WAS.
SO WAS MY PATIENT.
LOOK, I'D LIKE TO STAY FOR A WHILE. I HAVE TO DO SOME WORK HERE.
I SPEAK THE LANGUAGE. THERE ARE PARTISANS TO BE DISARMED.
WE EMBRACE THEM AND SEE IF WE CAN RELIEVE THEM OF THEIR WEAPONS,
YOU KNOW, WHILE WE HUG.
I WAS A THIEF, SO THE ARMY THOUGHT I'D BE GOOD AT IT.
SO YOU CAN SHOOT A PISTOL.
NO.
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THOSE?
NO.
WELL, I SHOULD LOOK AT THEM BEFORE YOU GO. LOOK, IT'S A BIG PLACE.
LOOK, IT'S A BIG PLACE. WE NEEDN'T DISTURB EACH OTHER.
I'LL SLEEP IN THE STABLE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE I SLEEP.
I DON'T SLEEP. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MARY TOLD YOU ABOUT ME, BUT I DON'T NEED COMPANY,
I DON'T NEED TO BE LOOKED AFTER.
THERE'S A MAN DOWNSTAIRS.
HE BROUGHT US EGGS.
HE MIGHT STAY.
WHY? CAN HE LAY EGGS?
HE'S CANADIAN.
WHY ARE PEOPLE ALWAYS SO HAPPY
WHEN THEY COLLIDE WITH SOMEONE FROM THE SAME PLACE?
WHAT HAPPENED IN MONTREAL WHEN YOU PASSED A MAN IN THE STREET? DID YOU INVITE HIM TO LIVE WITH YOU?
DID YOU INVITE HIM TO LIVE WITH YOU?
HE NEEDN'T DISTURB YOU.
HE CAN'T. I'M ALREADY DISTURBED.
THERE'S A WAR.
WHERE YOU COME FROM BECOMES IMPORTANT.
WHY? I HATE THAT IDEA.
THAT'S GONNA WORK. [CHUCKLES]
GENTLY.
OH, IT'S FINISHED.
SO YOU'RE OUR CANADIAN PICKPOCKET.
THIEF, I THINK, IS MORE ACCURATE. I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE IN AFRICA.
WHEREABOUTS?
OH...ALL OVER.
ALL OVER?
I KEPT TRYING TO COVER A VERY MODEST PORTION
AND STILL FAILED. ARE YOU LEAVING US?
YES. NOW IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SWAP WAR WOUNDS.
OH, THEN I'M DEFINITELY GOING.
DOES SHE HAVE WAR WOUNDS?
I THINK ANYBODY SHE EVER LOVES TENDS TO DIE ON HER.
ARE YOU PLANNING TO BE THE EXCEPTION?
ME? [COUGHS]
I THINK YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG END OF THE STICK, OLD BOY.
SO...
CARAVAGGIO...
HANA THINKS YOU INVENTED YOUR NAME.
AND YOU'VE FORGOTTEN YOURS.
I SAID THAT NO ONE WOULD EVER INVENT SUCH A PREPOSTEROUS NAME.
AND I SAID YOU CAN FORGET EVERYTHING...
BUT YOU NEVER FORGET YOUR NAME.
COUNT ALMASY.
THAT NAME MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?
OR KATHARINE CLIFTON?
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY?
OH, HELLO.
THEY DON'T SEE FOREIGN WOMEN IN THIS MARKET. HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY?
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY?
UM...£7, £8, I SUPPOSE.
WHICH STALL?
WHY? YOU'VE BEEN CHEATED.
OH, DON'T WORRY. WE'LL TAKE IT BACK. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT BACK. THIS IS NOT WORTH £8, MRS. CLIFTON.
THIS IS NOT WORTH £8, MRS. CLIFTON.
IT IS TO ME. DID YOU BARGAIN?
I DON'T CARE TO BARGAIN.
WELL, THAT INSULTS THEM.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. I THINK THAT YOU'RE INSULTED BY ME SOMEHOW.
I'D BE VERY HAPPY TO OBTAIN THE CORRECT PRICE FOR THIS.
I APOLOGIZE IF I APPEAR ABRUPT.
I'M RUSTY AT SOCIAL GRACES.
UH, HOW DO YOU FIND CAIRO? DID YOU VISIT THE PYRAMIDS?
EXCUSE ME.
OR THE SPHINX?
LATITUDE: 25.33. LONGITUDE: 25.16.
WE ATTEMPT TO DRIVE NORTHEAST OF KUFRA, WE LEAVE OUR BONES IN THE DESERT.
I DISAGREE. YOU'RE HUNGARIAN. GOOD EVENING, GENTLEMEN. GOOD EVENING.
GOOD EVENING. HOW IS YOUR CHARMING WIFE?
MARVELOUS, SHE, UH... SHE'S IN LOVE WITH THE HOTEL PLUMBING.
SHE'S EITHER IN THE SWIMMING POOL-- SHE SWIMS FOR HOURS. SHE'S A FISH. QUITE INCREDIBLE-- OR SHE'S IN THE BATH.
SHE'S A FISH. QUITE INCREDIBLE-- OR SHE'S IN THE BATH.
ACTUALLY, SHE'S JUST OUTSIDE.
CHAPS ONLY IN THE LONG BAR.
MRS. CLIFTON.
YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE US.
WE'RE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO THE COMPANY OF WOMEN.
NOT AT ALL. I WAS THOROUGHLY ENJOYING MY BOOK.
THE TEAM IS IN MOURNING, DARLING. OH, REALLY?
I'M AFRAID WE'RE NOT HAVING MUCH LUCK OBTAINING FUNDS FOR THE EXPEDITION.
OH. WELL, WHAT'LL YOU DO? A MORE MODEST EXPEDITION.
OR EVEN WAIT A YEAR.
IT'S A DISASTER. REMIND OUR FAMILIES WE STILL EXIST.
GOOD HEAVENS, ARE YOU MARRIED, MADOX?
VERY MUCH SO. WE ALL ARE...
SAVE MY FRIEND ALMASY HERE. OH, I FEEL MUCH BETTER. DON'T YOU, DARLING?
WE WERE FEELING RATHER SELF-CONSCIOUS.
WELL, LET'S TOAST, THEN. ABSENT WIVES.
ABSENT WIVES. ABSENT WIVES. AND PRESENT ONES.
AND FUTURE ONES.
THANK YOU.
EXCUSE ME. MAY I?
WHY DID YOU FOLLOW ME YESTERDAY? I'M SORRY. WHAT?
AFTER THE MARKET, YOU FOLLOWED ME TO THE HOTEL.
I WAS CONCERNED.
A WOMAN IN THAT PART OF CAIRO, A EUROPEAN WOMAN... I FELT OBLIGED TO.
A EUROPEAN WOMAN... I FELT OBLIGED TO. YOU FELT OBLIGED TO.
AS THE WIFE OF ONE OF OUR PARTY.
SO WHY FOLLOW ME?
ESCORT ME, BY ALL MEANS, BUT FOLLOWING ME IS PREDATORY, ISN'T IT?
COULD I... ASK YOU TO MOVE?
I'M SORRY... BUT I...
OH, I'M SORRY.
OF COURSE.
IT'S JUST WHEN YOU MOVE... HOW STUPID OF ME.
HOW STUPID OF ME. I CAN'T REALLY BEAR THE...
MMM, PRESSURE ON THE...
YOU ALL RIGHT?
I WAS DREAMING. AWFUL.
HANA.
HANA.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
LEAVE ME ALONE.
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HIM, AREN'T YOU...
YOUR POOR PATIENT?
YOU THINK HE'S A SAINT BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE LOOKS?
I DON'T THINK HE IS.
I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH HIM.
I'M IN LOVE WITH GHOSTS.
SO IS HE. HE'S IN LOVE WITH GHOSTS.
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU HE DID THIS TO ME?
HOW COULD HE HAVE? WHEN?
I'M ONE OF HIS GHOSTS, AND HE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. ASK YOUR SAINT WHO HE IS.
ASK HIM WHO HE'S KILLED.
PLEASE DON'T CREEP AROUND THIS HOUSE.
SEE, I DON'T THINK HE'S FORGOTTEN ANYTHING.
I THINK HE WANTS TO FORGET.
GENTLEMEN... TO MAP MAKING.
All: TO MAP MAKING.
AND A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO GEOFFREY AND KATHARINE,
WITHOUT WHOSE FUND-RAISING HEROICS WE'D STILL BE KICKING OUR HEELS.
TO ARM TWISTING. ARM TWISTING. ARM TWISTING.
DID KATHARINE SAY? GEOFFREY HAS TO FLY BACK TO CAIRO.
RETURN THE FAVOR. TAKE A FEW PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE ARMY.
UM, WHAT KIND OF PHOTOGRAPHS?
PORTRAITS.
THE BRIGADIER...
THE BRIGADIER'S WIFE, THE BRIGADIER'S DOG,
BRIGADIER BY THE PYRAMIDS, BRIGADIER BREATHING.
AND I SHALL, OF COURSE, BE BEREFT...
BUT FINALLY ABLE TO EXPLORE THE CAIRO NIGHT LIFE.
I SHALL PRODUCE AN AUTHORITATIVE GUIDE TO THE ZINC BARS AND...
I WANT TO SAY, HAREEMS. AM I IN THE RIGHT COUNTRY FOR HAREEMS?
Madox: HAREM. [MEN CHUCKLE]
BYE, MY LOVE.
BE SAFE.
I'LL CATCH UP IN A WEEK.
CLIFTON.
SAFE JOURNEY. YOU, TOO. GOOD LUCK.
GLAD THE FUNDS HAVE TURNED UP.
CLIFTON.
IT'S PROBABLY NONE OF MY BUSINESS.
YOUR WIFE.
DO YOU THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO LEAVE HER?
APPROPRIATE?
WELL, THE DESERT IS, IT'S, UH... FOR A WOMAN, IT'S VERY TOUGH.
I WONDER IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH FOR HER. ARE YOU MAD? KATHARINE LOVES IT HERE. SHE TOLD ME YESTERDAY.
ARE YOU MAD? KATHARINE LOVES IT HERE. SHE TOLD ME YESTERDAY.
ALL THE SAME, WERE I YOU-- I'VE KNOWN KATHARINE SINCE SHE WAS 3.
WE WERE PRACTICALLY BROTHER AND SISTER BEFORE WE WERE MAN AND WIFE.
I THINK I'D KNOW WHAT IS AND WHAT ISN'T TOO MUCH FOR HER.
I THINK SHE'D KNOW HERSELF.
VERY WELL.
WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE SO THREATENED BY A WOMAN?
I HAVE COME...TO LOVE...
THAT LITTLE TAP OF THE FINGERNAIL AGAINST THE...SYRINGE.
TAP.
TAP.
TAP.
STOP PLAYING! PLEASE. STOP PLAYING.
I DON'T HAVE THE KEY TO THAT DOOR. YOU...
THE GERMANS WERE HERE. THE GERMANS WERE ALL OVER THIS AREA.
THEY LEFT MINES EVERYWHERE.
AND PIANOS WERE THEIR FAVORITE HIDING PLACES.
I SEE. SORRY.
THEN MAYBE YOU'RE SAFE AS LONG AS YOU ONLY PLAY BACH.
HE'S GERMAN.
IS SOMETHING FUNNY?
NO. I'M SORRY.
I'VE MET YOU BEFORE.
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
LOOK. SEE?
MOVE THAT... AND NO MORE BACH.
LIEUTENANT!
YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?
FINE, SERGEANT.
SO YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE ITALIANS?
YEAH, TRYIN' TO GET THEM TO GIVE UP THEIR WEAPONS.
I WAS A THIEF, SO THE ARMY THOUGHT I'D BE GOOD AT IT.
OH, I LIKE THE ITALIANS. GRIT.
Hana: HE WANTS US TO MOVE OUT.
HE SAYS THERE COULD BE 50 MORE MINES IN THE BUILDING.
HE THINKS I'M MAD BECAUSE I LAUGH AT HIM.
HE'S INDIAN.
HE WEARS A TURBAN. NO, HE'S SIKH. IF HE WEARS A TURBAN...
NO, HE'S SIKH. IF HE WEARS A TURBAN... HE'S SIKH.
I'LL PROBABLY MARRY HIM.
REALLY?
THAT'S SUDDEN.
MY MOTHER ALWAYS TOLD ME
I WOULD SUMMON MY HUSBAND BY PLAYING THE PIANO.
I LIKED IT BETTER WHEN THERE WERE JUST THE TWO OF US.
WHY? IS HE STAYING? WITH HIS SERGEANT-- A MR. HARDY.
WE SHOULD CHARGE.
DOESN'T ANYONE... HAVE A JOB TO DO?
THEY HAVE TO CLEAR ALL THE ROADS OF MINES.
THAT'S A BIG JOB.
IN THAT CASE, I SUPPOSE WE CAN'T CHARGE.
NO, WE CAN'T.
THANK YOU.

LET ME HELP.
ALMASY! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, YES, I'M FINE.
AAAH!
I'LL BE BACK AS QUICK AS I CAN. 36 HOURS AT THE OUTSIDE.
TRY TO GET AN ADDITIONAL RADIATOR.
WE CAN STORE IT BETWEEN HERE AND POTTERY HILL.

WE PLANNED BADLY.

ALL RIGHT. COME ON, LET'S GET GOING.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO PASTE THEM INTO YOUR BOOK.
WELL, WE, UH...
WE TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS.
THERE'S NO NEED.
NO, REALLY. I'D LIKE YOU TO HAVE THEM. WELL, THERE'S REALLY NO NEED. THIS IS, UM...
THIS IS JUST A SCRAPBOOK.
THEY'RE TOO GOOD. I SHOULD...
FEEL OBLIGED. THANK YOU.
AND THAT WOULD BE UNCONSCIONABLE, I SUPPOSE, WOULDN'T IT?
TO FEEL ANY OBLIGATION?
YES, OF COURSE IT WOULD.
YOU SHOULD COME INTO THE SHELTER.
I'M QUITE ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
LOOK OVER THERE.
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?
DO YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM... THE STARS?
THEY'RE SO UNTIDY.
I WAS...TRYING TO REARRANGE THEM. NO, NO.
OVER THERE.
IN A FEW MINUTES, THERE'LL BE NO STARS.
THE AIR IS FILLING WITH SAND.
THIS IS NOT VERY GOOD, IS IT? NO.
WILL WE BE ALL RIGHT? YES.
YES.
ABSOLUTELY.
"YES" IS A COMFORT. "ABSOLUTELY" IS NOT.
Almásy: LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT WINDS.
THERE IS A...A WHIRLWIND FROM THE SOUTHERN MOROCCO...
THE AAJEJ...
AGAINST WHICH THE FELLAHIN DEFEND THEMSELVES WITH KNIVES.
AND THERE IS, UH... THE GHIB LI FROM TUNIS.
THE GHIBLI. THE GHIBLI...
WHICH ROLLS AND ROLLS AND ROLLS AND PRODUCES, UH...
UM, A RATHER STRANGE NERVOUS CONDITION.
AND THEN THERE IS THE, UH...
THE HARMATTAN...
A RED WIND...
WHICH MARINERS CALL THE SEA OF DARKNESS.
AND RED SAND FROM THIS WIND HAS FLOWN AS FAR AS THE SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND,
APPARENTLY PRODUCING... SHOWERS SO DENSE
APPARENTLY PRODUCING... SHOWERS SO DENSE THAT THEY WERE MISTAKEN FOR BLOOD.
FICTION.
WE HAVE A HOUSE ON THAT COAST, AND IT HAS NEVER, NEVER RAINED BLOOD. NO, IT'S ALL TRUE. NEVER.
NO, IT'S ALL TRUE. NEVER.
HERODOTUS... [CHUCKLES] YOUR FRIEND... MY FRIEND.
HE WRITES ABOUT IT.
AND HE WRITES ABOUT...
A...A WIND... THE SIMOON...
WHICH...A NATION THOUGHT WAS SO EVIL, THEY DECLARED WAR ON IT
AND MARCHED OUT AGAINST IT...
IN FULL BATTLE DRESS...
THEIR SWORDS... RAISED.
KATHARINE. HMM?
I NEED TO GET OUT YOUR SIDE, QUICK!
COME ON, LET ME OUT!
OF COURSE. I'M SORRY.
RIDICULOUS TO FALL ASLEEP!
UNFORGIVABLE!
DAMN! THE FLARE!
STOP! OVER HERE!
[HORN HONKING] HERE!
[HONKING] STOP!
MADOX!
Almásy: MADOX!
MADOX!
OUR TRACKS HAVE DISAPPEARED.
MADOX WILL CALCULATE HOW MANY MILES. HE'LL SOON TURN AROUND.
COULD I ASK YOU, PLEASE, TO...
PASTE YOUR PAINTINGS INTO MY BOOK?
I--I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM. I SHOULD BE HONORED.
[HORN HONKS, MUFFLED] THE OTHERS!
OH, GOD. [HORN HONKING] QUICK!
OH, HOW AWFUL. WE'VE GOT TO GET 'EM OUT! QUICK, GET THE OTHER SHOVEL!
AM I A TERRIBLE COWARD TO ASK HOW MUCH WATER WE HAVE LEFT?
A LITTLE IN OUR CAN. WE HAVE, UH, WATER IN THE RADIATOR,
WHICH CAN BE DRUNK, AND, UH...
IT'S NOT COWARDLY AT ALL. IT'S EXTREMELY PRACTICAL. WE, UH...
WE, UH... OH, COME ON, COME ON.
THERE'S ALSO A PLANT. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT,
BUT I BELIEVE YOU CAN CUT A--
A PIECE THE SIZE OF A HEART FROM THIS PLANT, AND THE NEXT MORNING, IT'LL BE FILLED
AND THE NEXT MORNING, IT'LL BE FILLED WITH A DELICIOUS LIQUID.
FIND THAT PLANT. [BEEP BEEP]
CUT OUT ITS HEART.
HERE.
HERE'S THE WINDOW.
CLEAR THE GLASS. I'LL CLEAR THE DOOR.
MIND YOUR HANDS.
IT'S OK. WE'RE HERE.
COME ON. CLEAR IT. QUICK.
HANG ON. WE'RE COMING.
I'VE GOT IT. I'VE GOT IT. [GASPING] HERE. OHHH...
Almásy: KATHARINE!
WATER.
Katharine: GEOFFREY'S NOT IN CAIRO.
HE'S NOT ACTUALLY A BUFFOON.
THE PLANE WASN'T A WEDDING PRESENT. IT BELONGS TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT.
THEY WANT AERIAL MAPS OF THE WHOLE OF NORTH AFRICA.
SO I THINK HE'S IN ETHIOPIA.
IN CASE YOU'RE COUNTING ON HIS SUDDEN APPEARANCE.
AND THE MARRIAGE,
IS THAT A FICTION?
NO, THE MARRIAGE ISN'T A FICTION.
OH, THANK GOD.
THANK GOD.
MADOX.
[CHUCKLES] IT'S MADOX.
AM I "K" IN YOUR BOOK?
I THINK I MUST BE.
Kip: "CHAPTER ONE.
"HE SAT, IN DEFIANCE OF MUNICIPAL ORDERS, ASTRIDE THE GUN ZAM ZAMMAH."
I CAN'T READ THESE WORDS.
I CAN'T READ THEM. THEY STICK IN MY THROAT.
Almásy: BECAUSE YOU'RE READING IT TOO FAST. Kip: NOT AT ALL.
YOU HAVE TO READ KIPLING SLOWLY.
YOUR EYE IS TOO IMPATIENT. THINK ABOUT THE SPEED OF HIS PEN.
WHAT IS IT? "HE SAT," COMMA,
"IN DEFIANCE OF MUNICIPAL ORDERS," COMMA,
"ASTRIDE THE GUN ZAM ZAMMAH ON HER BRICK--"
WHAT IS IT?
"BRICK PLATFORM OPPOSITE THE OLD AJAIB-GHER."
"THE WONDER HOUSE,"
COMMA,
"AS THE NATIVES CALLED THE LAHORE MUSEUM."
IT'S STILL THERE, THE CANNON, OUTSIDE THE MUSEUM.
IT WAS MADE OF METAL CUPS AND BOWLS TAKEN
FROM EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN THE CITY AS TAX, THEN MELTED DOWN.
THEN LATER THEY FIRED THE CANNON AT MY PEOPLE,
COMMA,
THE NATIVES.
FULL STOP.
WHAT EXACTLY IS IT YOU OBJECT TO, THE WRITER OR WHAT HE'S WRITING ABOUT?
THE WRITER OR WHAT HE'S WRITING ABOUT?
WHAT I REALLY OBJECT TO, UNCLE,
IS YOUR FINISHING ALL MY CONDENSED MILK.
AND THE MESSAGE EVERYWHERE IN YOUR BOOK, HOWEVER SLOWLY I READ IT,
THAT THE BEST THING FOR INDIA IS TO BE RULED BY THE BRITISH.
HANA, WE HAVE DISCOVERED A SHARED PLEASURE, THE BOY AND I.
ARGUING ABOUT BOOKS. CONDENSED MILK.
ONE OF THE TRULY GREAT INVENTIONS.
I'LL GET ANOTHER TIN.
I DIDN'T LIKE THAT BOOK EITHER.
IT'S ALL ABOUT MEN.
TOO MANY MEN.
JUST LIKE THIS HOUSE.
YOU LIKE HIM, DON'T YOU? YOUR VOICE CHANGES.
NO, I DON'T THINK IT DOES.
ANYWAY, HE'S INDIFFERENT TO ME. I DON'T THINK IT'S INDIFFERENCE.
HANA WAS JUST TELLING ME YOUR INDIFFERENCE... HEY!
TO HER COOKING.
WELL, I'M INDIFFERENT TO COOKING, NOT HANA'S COOKING IN PARTICULAR.
HAVE EITHER OF YOU TRIED CONDENSED MILK SANDWICHES?
THEY'RE VERY GOOD WITH SALT.
WELCOME BACK, MADAM.
WILL YOU NOT COME IN?
NO.
I SHOULD GO HOME. WILL YOU PLEASE COME IN?
MRS. CLIFTON...
DON'T.
I BELIEVE YOU STILL HAVE MY BOOK.
THANK YOU.
YOU STILL HAVE SAND IN YOUR HAIR.
I'M IMPRESSED YOU CAN SEW.
GOOD.
YOU SEW VERY BADLY.
WELL, YOU DON'T SEW AT ALL.
A WOMAN SHOULD NEVER LEARN TO SEW, AND IF SHE CAN SHE SHOULDN'T ADMIT TO IT.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
MAKES IT HARDER STILL. [CHUCKLES]
WHEN WERE YOU MOST HAPPY?
NOW.
AND WHEN WERE YOU LEAST HAPPY?
NOW.
WHAT DO YOU LOVE? WHAT DO I LOVE?
SAY EVERYTHING. HMM, LET'S SEE.
WATER...
THE FISH IN IT...
AND HEDGEHOGS. I LOVE HEDGEHOGS.
AND HEDGEHOGS. I LOVE HEDGEHOGS. AND WHAT ELSE?
MARMITE. I'M ADDICTED.
AND BATHS,
BUT NOT WITH OTHER PEOPLE.
ISLANDS.
AND YOUR HANDWRITING.
I COULD GO ON ALL DAY. GO ON ALL DAY.
MY HUSBAND.
WHAT DO YOU HATE MOST?
A LIE.
WHAT DO YOU HATE MOST?
OWNERSHIP.
BEING OWNED.
WHEN YOU LEAVE, YOU SHOULD FORGET ME.
Hana: WHO IS THIS?
Almásy: DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?
IS IT YOU?
[CHUCKLES] SO FAT.
THAT'S A CHRISTMAS CRACKER.
A FIRECRACKER.
THIS ISN'T YOUR HANDWRITING, IS IT? YES, IT IS.
"DECEMBER 22nd.
"BETRAYALS IN WAR
"ARE CHILDLIKE COMPARED "WITH OUR BETRAYALS DURING PEACE.
"NEW LOVERS ARE NERVOUS AND TENDER,
"BUT SMASH EVERYTHING,
FOR THE HEART IS AN ORGAN OF FIRE."
"FOR THE HEART IS AN ORGAN OF FIRE."
I LOVE THAT.
I BELIEVE THAT.
"K."
WHO IS "K"?
"K"...
IS FOR KATHARINE.
MERRY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS.
SAY YOU'RE SICK.
WHAT? NO. SAY YOU'RE FEELING FAINT.
SAY YOU'RE FEELING FAINT.
THE HEAT.
NO. I CAN'T WORK.
I CAN'T SLEEP.
I CAN'T SLEEP. KATHARINE!
COMING!
I CAN'T SLEEP.
I WAKE UP SHOUTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
GEOFFREY THINKS IT'S THE THING IN THE DESERT,
THE TRAUMA. I CAN STILL TASTE YOU.
PHILLIPA, THIS IS EMPTY.
I TRY TO WRITE
WITH YOUR TASTE IN MY MOUTH.
SWOON.
I'LL CATCH YOU.
YOU'RE GONNA MISS ALL THE FUN! OFF WE GO TO SEE MY SLED OUTSIDE!
OFF WE GO TO SEE MY SLED OUTSIDE! HO HO HO! OFF WE GO!
MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE!
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
KATHARINE! OH, MY GOODNESS!
FETCH A CHAIR.
I'M FINE. HOW SILLY.
IT'S THIS HEAT. IT'S TERRIBLE. IS SHE ALL RIGHT? SHE'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.
SHE'S QUITE ALL RIGHT. OH, GOOD.
ARE YOU PREGNANT?
I DON'T THINK SO, NO. [LAUGHS] HOW ROMANTIC.
[LAUGHS] HOW ROMANTIC.
WITH FIONA, I FELL OVER EVERY 5 MINUTES.
RONNIE CHRISTENED ME LADY DOWNFALL.
DO YOU KNOW I THINK I MIGHT GO INSIDE AND SIT DOWN FOR A FEW MINUTES.
I'LL COME WITH YOU. NO, I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. YOU STAY HERE.
ARE YOU SURE?
HAPPY CHRISTMAS!
HAVE YOU SEEN KATHARINE? WHAT?
IT'S CLIFTON UNDER HERE. OH, NO, I HAVEN'T. SORRY.
DARLING, I JUST HEARD.
POOR SAUSAGE. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M FINE. JUST TOO HOT.
LADY H THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE PREGNANT.
I'M NOT PREGNANT. I'M JUST HOT. TOO HOT. AREN'T YOU?
TOO HOT. AREN'T YOU? I'M SWELTERING.
COME ON, I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.
COME ON, I'LL TAKE YOU HOME. CAN WE REALLY GO HOME?
I CAN'T BREATHE.
ARE YOU DYING FOR GREEN, ANYTHING GREEN, OR RAIN?
IT'S CHRISTMAS, AND IT'S ALL--
I DON'T KNOW.
IF YOU ASKED, "MAY I GO HOME TOMORROW?" IF YOU WANTED.
IF YOU WANTED.
DARLING, YOU KNOW WE CAN'T GO HOME. THERE MIGHT BE A WAR.
OH, GEOFFREY,
YOU DO SO LOVE A DISGUISE.
I DO SO LOVE YOU.
WHAT DO YOU SMELL OF? WHAT?
MARZIPAN.
I THINK YOU GOT MARZIPAN IN YOUR HAIR.
NOW WONDER YOU'RE HOMESICK.
IS IT YOU?
WHAT?
IF I SAID MOOSE...
MOOSE? WHO THE HELL'S MOOSE?
I LOOK DIFFERENT. WHY SHOULDN'T YOU?
I HEARD YOUR BREATHING.
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE RAIN.
I'M DYING FOR RAIN.
I'M DYING ANYWAY, BUT I--
I LONG FOR THE RAIN ON MY FACE.
FIRST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? [CHUCKLES] I DON'T KNOW.
[CHUCKLES] I DON'T KNOW.
PAPER? IS IT? I DON'T KNOW.
IS IT? I DON'T KNOW.
PAPER.
PAPER?
DARLING, IT'S ME. LISTEN, I'M SORRY. SOMETHING'S COME UP.
Katharine: OH, NO.
NOW DON'T SULK. I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW EVENING. I'M GOING TO SULK,
AND I'M NOT MOVING TILL YOU GET BACK HERE. PROMISE? THAT'S GOOD.
PROMISE? THAT'S GOOD. OK, MY SAUSAGE. I LOVE YOU.
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GOING ANYWHERE. I'M NOT. I'M GONNA SURPRISE HER.
I'M NOT. I'M GONNA SURPRISE HER. IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY.
SHE'S FORGOTTEN, OF COURSE.
WHAT THE SYMBOL OF YOUR FIRST ANNIVERSARY?
I SHOULD GET SOMETHING. IS IT COTTON OR PAPER?
FIRST ANNIVERSARY?
WHAT? YOU TWO HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR DONKEY'S YEARS.
BEEN FRIENDS FOR DONKEY'S YEARS.
BEST FRIENDS.
SHE WAS ALWAYS CRYING ON MY SHOULDER ABOUT SOMEBODY.
I FINALLY PERSUADED HER TO SETTLE FOR MY SHOULDER.
A STROKE OF GENIUS.
MOOSE, ARE YOU THERE?
YES, GEOFFREY.
FIRST ANNIVERSARY. IS THAT COTTON?
IS WHAT COTTON?
FIRST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.
FIRST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. YOUR FIRST ANNIVERSARY IS...PAPER.
YOUR FIRST ANNIVERSARY IS...PAPER.
STOP.
PLEASE?
ST...STOP HERE.
HERE? JUST STOP RIGHT HERE.
YES, SIR.
WHAT IS THIS?
IT'S A FOLK SONG.
Katharine: ARABIC? NO, NO, IT'S HUNGARIAN.
MY DAIJK A SANG IT TO ME
WHEN I WAS A CHILD GROWING UP IN BUDAPEST.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
MM. WHAT'S IT ABOUT?
SZERELE M MEANS LOVE,
AND THE STORY, WELL, THERE'S THIS HUNGARIAN COUNT.
HE'S A WANDERER, HE'S A FOOL,
AND FOR YEARS HE'S ON SOME KIND OF A QUEST
FOR WHO KNOWS WHAT,
AND THEN ONE DAY HE FALLS UNDER THE SPELL OF A MYSTERIOUS ENGLISHWOMAN,
OF A MYSTERIOUS ENGLISHWOMAN,
A HARPY,
WHO BEATS HIM AND HITS HIM AND HE BECOMES HER SLAVE.
AND HE SEWS HER CLOAK, HE WORSHIPS--
AND HE SEWS HER CLOAK, HE WORSHIPS-- [LAUGHS] STOP THAT.
STOP. YOU'RE ALWAYS BEATING ME!
BASTARD!
YOU BASTARD. I BELIEVED YOU.
YOU SHOULD BE MY SLAVE.
I CLAIM THIS SHOULDER BLADE.
NO, WAIT, I WANT-- TURN OVER.
I WANT THIS-- THIS--
Laszlo: THIS PLACE.
I LOVE THIS PLACE. WHAT'S IT CALLED?
THIS IS MINE.
I'M GOING TO ASK THE KING PERMISSION TO CALL IT THE ALMASY BOSPORUS.
I THOUGHT WE WERE AGAINST OWNERSHIP?
I CAN STAY TONIGHT.
MADOX KNOWS, I THINK.
HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT ANNA KARENINA.
I THINK IT'S HIS IDEA OF A MAN-TO-MAN CHAT.
WELL, IT'S MY IDEA OF A MAN-TO-MAN CHAT.
THIS IS A DIFFERENT WORLD, IS WHAT I TELL MYSELF.
A DIFFERENT LIFE.
AND HERE I'M A DIFFERENT WIFE.
YEAH, YOU ARE A DIFFERENT WIFE.
OH, THEY'RE DARLING. WHAT ARE THEY, THIMBLES?
YES. THEY'RE QUITE OLD.
IT'S FULL OF SAFFRON,
JUST IN CASE YOU THINK I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU TO ENCOURAGE YOUR SEWING.
TO ENCOURAGE YOUR SEWING.
I DON'T CARE TO BARGAIN.
THAT DAY, DID YOU FOLLOW ME TO THE MARKET?
YES, OF COURSE.
SHALL WE BE ALL RIGHT?
YES.
YES.
ABSOLUTELY.
OH, DEAR.
THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER WAKE UP.
WHAT?
WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT? I LIBERATED IT.
I THINK THAT'S CALLED LOOTING. NO ONE SHOULD OWN MUSIC. THE REAL QUESTION IS,
NO ONE SHOULD OWN MUSIC. THE REAL QUESTION IS,
WHO WROTE THE SONG? IRVING BERLIN. FOR? TOP HAT.
FOR? TOP HAT.
IS THERE A SONG YOU DON'T KNOW? Hana: NOPE. HE SINGS ALL THE TIME. GOOD MORNING.
DID YOU KNOW THAT? YOU'RE ALWAYS SINGING.
I'VE BEEN TOLD BEFORE.
MM-HMM. KIP'S ANOTHER ONE.
WANG WANG BLUES.
YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.
GOOD MORNING, MISS. HELLO.
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE VERY, VERY TALL.
YOU SEEMED SO BIG AND...
GIANT...
AND I FEEL LIKE A CHILD WHO CAN'T KEEP HER BALANCE.
A TODDLER.
A TODDLER.
MY HAIR WAS LONG AT SOME POINT.
I'D FORGOTTEN WHAT A NUISANCE IT IS TO WASH.
TRY THIS. I FOUND A GREAT JAR OF IT. OLIVE OIL.
OLIVE OIL.
THANK YOU.
IS THIS FOR MY HAIR?
YES, FOR YOUR HAIR.
THERE WAS A GENERAL WHO WORE A PATCH
OVER A PERFECTLY GOOD EYE.
THE MEN FOUGHT HARDER FOR HIM.
SOMETIMES I THINK I COULD GET UP AND DANCE.
WHAT'S UNDER YOUR MITTENS?
WHAT'S UNDER YOUR MITTENS?
HE'S WAITING FOR YOU.
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT?
Officer: LOOK, MOOSE,
WE NEED YOU TO STAY IN TOBRUK. I KNOW IT'S A BIT OF A SHORT STRAW.
JERRYS GOT OUR MAPS, YOU KNOW.
AND NOW THEY'RE GETTING THEIR SPIES INTO CAIRO USING OUR MAPS.
THEY'LL GET ROMMEL INTO CAIRO USING OUR MAPS.
THE WHOLE OF THE DESERT'S LIKE A BLOODY BUS ROUTE,
AND WE GAVE IT TO THEM!
ANY FOREIGNER WHO TURNED UP, "WELCOME TO THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHIC. TAKE OUR MAPS."
YEAH. OLD MADOX WENT MAD, YOU KNOW.
DID YOU KNOW PETER MADOX? YEAH.
MAGNIFICENT EXPLORER.
THANKS, AICHA. AFTER HE'D FOUND OUT HE'D BEEN BETRAYED BY ALMASY,
HIS BEST FRIEND.
ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED THE POOR SOD.
German officer: MEIN KOMMANDANT.

Soldier: GET UP.
Soldier: GET UP AT ONCE!
Woman, crying: I DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY!
HALT!
Woman: NO!

Officer DAVID CARAVAGGIO. NO.
THIS WAS TAKEN IN CAIRO AT BRITISH HEADQUARTERS.
JULY '41.
AND SO WAS THIS.
AUGUST '41.
AND THIS.
FEBRUARY '42.
IT'S POSSIBLE...
I WAS BUYING OR SELLING SOMETHING. I'VE BEEN TO CAIRO MANY TIMES.
YOU ARE A CANADIAN SPY WORKING FOR THE ALLIES.
CODE NAME: MOOSE.
Man: JA? ALLO? [SPEAKING GERMAN]
JA?
CAN YOU GET ME A DOCTOR?
I'M SICK.
[SPEAKING GERMAN] I'M LEAKING BLOOD.
YOU WANT A DOCTOR? I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR WEEKS, MONTHS. I DON'T KNOW--
I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR WEEKS, MONTHS. I DON'T KNOW-- WE DON'T HAVE A DOCTOR.
BUT WE DO HAVE A NURSE. SURE, GREAT. A-- A NURSE WOULD BE GREAT!
LOOK... GIVE ME SOMETHING.
A NAME, A CODE, SO WE CAN ALL GET OUT OF THIS ROOM.
I CAN'T THINK IN THIS HEAT. [FLIES BUZZING]
IT'S TOO HOT.
I SLEPT WITH A GIRL.
I'VE GOT A WIFE IN TRIPOLI.
A GIRL COMES UP AND POINTS AT YOU, YOU ONLY SEE TROUBLE.
Maj. Muller: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
THIS IS YOUR NURSE, BY THE WAY. SHE'S MUSLIM,
SO SHE'LL UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS.
WHAT'S THE PUNISHMENT FOR ADULTERY? LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT.
YOU'RE MARRIED, AND YOU WERE FUCKING ANOTHER WOMAN, SO THAT'S, UH...
IS IT THE HANDS THAT ARE CUT OFF?
OR IS THAT FOR STEALING? DOES ANYONE KNOW?
WELL, YOU MUST KNOW. YOU WERE BROUGHT UP IN LIBYA, YES?
DON'T CUT ME. OR WAS IT TORONTO?
10 FINGERS.
HOW ABOUT THIS?
YOU GIVE ME A NAME FOR EVERY FINGER.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO.
I GET SOMETHING. YOU KEEP SOMETHING.
I'M TRYING TO BE REASONABLE. DON'T CUT ME. COME ON!
ARE THUMBS FINGERS?
I GET NO HELP FROM THESE PEOPLE. TELEPHON, HERR MAJOR.
I'M SICK OF THIS ROOM.
I'M SICK OF THIS HEAT! AND I'M SICK OF THIS PHONE!
GENEVA CONVENTION! HEY! COME ON, YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
COME OVER HERE. I'LL GIVE YOU NAMES.

Caravaggio: THE MAN WHO TOOK MY THUMBS?
I FOUND HIM EVENTUALLY.
I KILLED HIM.
THE MAN WHO TOOK MY PHOTOGRAPH? I FOUND HIM, TOO. THAT TOOK ME A YEAR.
HE'S DEAD.
ANOTHER MAN SHOWED THE GERMANS A WAY TO GET THEIR SPIES INTO CAIRO.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR HIM.
Madox: YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH THERE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
Almásy: I WAS LOOKING AGAIN AT BELL'S OLD MAPS.
IF WE CAN FIND A WAY THROUGH THE WADI, WE CAN DRIVE STRAIGHT INTO CAIRO,
AND THIS WHOLE SPUR IS A REAL POSSIBILITY.
SO ON THURSDAY YOU DON'T TRUST BELL'S MAP. BELL WAS A FOOL. BELL COULDN'T DRAW A MAP,
BELL WAS A FOOL. BELL COULDN'T DRAW A MAP, BUT ON FRIDAY HE'S SUDDENLY INFALLIBLE.
AND WHERE ARE THE EXPEDITION MAPS?
IN MY ROOM.
THOSE MAPS BELONG TO HIS MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT.
THEY SHOULDN'T BE LEFT LYING AROUND
FOR ANY TOM, DICK, OR HARRY TO HAVE SIGHT OF. SHH.
WHAT ON EARTH'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
DON'T BE SO BLOODY NAIVE! YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR BREAKING OUT!
THIS ARRIVED THIS MORNING.
"BY ORDER OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT:
ALL INTERNATIONAL EXPEDITIONS TO BE ABORTED BY MAY 1939."
WHAT DO THEY CARE ABOUT OUR MAPS?
WHAT DO WE FIND IN THE DESERT?
ARROWHEADS, SPEARS.
IN A WAR, IF YOU OWN THE DESERT, YOU OWN NORTH AFRICA.
OWN THE DESERT. [SCOFFS]
UM, MADOX...
THAT PLACE...
THAT PLACE AT THE BASE OF A WOMAN'S THROAT...
YOU KNOW, THE HOLLOW, HERE.
DOES IT HAVE AN OFFICIAL NAME?
FOR GOD'S SAKE, MAN,
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.
Newsreel announcer: NOWHERE IS THERE ANY WILD PATRIOTIC EXCITEMENT,
BUT EVERYWHERE THERE IS A DEEP HATRED OF WAR.
THE ANSWER LIES WITH ONE MAN.
AND THE SOLID MASS OF THE CROWDS SURGING ROUND HIS CAR
ARE A SYMBOL OF THE FACT
THAT THE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE MORE FIRMLY OF ONE MIND TODAY THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME IN OUR HISTORY.
THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME IN OUR HISTORY.
Newsreel announcer: THERE'S A GREAT TO-DO IN SANDOWN BAY
WITH ROWING AND SAILING AND NO END OF SPORT FOR EVERY WATER BABY.
SORRY.
I CAN'T. I CAN'T DO THIS.
I CAN'T DO THIS.
I CAN'T DO THIS. I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.
I BETTER GO NOW.
SAY GOOD-BYE HERE.
I'M NOT AGREEING.
DON'T THINK I'M AGREEING, BECAUSE I'M NOT.
ANY MINUTE NOW, HE'LL FIND OUT. WE'LL BARGE INTO SOMEONE. IT WILL KILL HIM.
DON'T GO OVER IT AGAIN, PLEASE.
KATHARINE...
I--
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW, I'M... I'M NOT MISSING YOU YET.
YOU WILL.
YOU WILL.
Almásy: I BELIEVE I'M RATHER LATE.
Madox: GOOD.
WE'RE ALL HERE.
A TOAST... TO THE INTERNATIONAL SAND CLUB.
MAY IT SOON RESURFACE.
All: THE INTERNATIONAL SAND CLUB.
Almásy: THE INTERNATIONAL SAND CLUB.
MISFITS, BUGGERS, FASCISTS, AND FOOLS.
GOD BLESS US EVERY ONE.
OOPS! MUSTN'T SAY "INTERNATIONAL."
DIRTY WORD. FILTHY WORD.
HIS MAJESTY. DIE FUHRER. IL DUCE. SORRY, WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
AND THE PEOPLE HERE DON'T WANT US. YOU MUST BE JOKING. THE EGYPTIANS ARE DESPERATE
YOU MUST BE JOKING. THE EGYPTIANS ARE DESPERATE TO GET RID OF THE COLONIALS.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT? FOUAD? SOME OF THEIR BEST PEOPLE
GETTING DOWN ON THEIR HANDS AND KNEES,
BEGGING TO BE SPARED A KNIGHTHOOD.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT? MMM? ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SIR RONNIE?
WHAT'S MY POINT?
OH, I'VE INVENTED A NEW DANCE! ANYBODY UP FOR IT? IT'S CALLED--
IT'S CALLED THE BOSPORUS HUG.
MADOX? BERMANN? YOU'LL DANCE WITH ME? MMM?
D'AG. COME ON, D'AGGERS. D'Agostino: LET'S EAT FIRST.
SIT DOWN.
Almásy: ♪ WE'LL BATHE AT BRIGHTON ♪ ♪ THE FISH YOU'LL FRIGHTEN ♪
♪ WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR BATHING SUIT SO THIN ♪
♪ WE'LL MAKE THE SHELLFISH GRIN ♪ ♪ FIN TO FIN ♪
THEY'RE PLAYING IT FAR TOO SLOWLY, BUT THESE WERE THE WORDS,
ACTUALLY, BEFORE THEY WERE CLEANED UP.
MIGHT BE A SONG...
FOR YOU, MRS. CLIFTON. Madox, whispering angrily: EITHER SHUT UP OR GO HOME!
YOU'RE COMPLETELY BLASTED! SIT DOWN! ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. SHUT UP, SHUT UP!
SORRY. SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.
I CAN'T THINK WHAT CAME OVER ME.
LASHING OF APOLOGIES...
ALL AROUND.
THANK YOU. [LAUGHS]
WHY WERE YOU HOLDING HIS COLLAR?
WHAT? [MOCKS] WHAT? THAT BOY, THAT LITTLE BOY.
THAT BOY, THAT LITTLE BOY.
YOU WERE HOLDING HIS COLLAR. YOU WERE GRIPPING HIS COLLAR. WHAT FOR?
IS HE NEXT? YOU'RE GOING TO DRAG HIM INTO YOUR LITTLE ROOM? WHERE IS IT? IS THIS IT?
WHERE IS IT? IS THIS IT? DON'T DO THIS. I'VE WATCHED YOU.
I'VE WATCHED YOU AT GARDEN PARTIES, ON VERANDAS, AT THE RACES.
ON VERANDAS, AT THE RACES.
HOW CAN YOU...
STAND THERE? PLEASE...
HOW CAN YOU...
EVER SMILE AS IF YOUR LIFE HADN'T...
CAPSIZED?!
YOU KNOW WHY?
DANCE WITH ME.
NO.
DANCE WITH ME.
I WANT TO TOUCH YOU.
I WANT THE THINGS WHICH ARE MINE, WHICH BELONG TO ME.
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO FEELS ANYTHING?
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?
WHY DON'T YOU GO...
AND GET SOME SLEEP?
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO?
[WHISPERS] Good night.
HANA.
KIP.
Kip: JUST WAIT.
Kip: JUST WAIT. DON'T LOOK AT ANYTHING YET.
WAIT.
KIP! [LAUGHS]
[BREATHLESS] OH, THANK YOU!
IF ONE NIGHT
I DIDN'T COME TO SEE YOU...
WHAT WOULD YOU DO? I'D TRY NOT TO EXPECT YOU.
YES, BUT IF IT GOT LATE,
AND... I HADN'T SHOWN UP.
THEN I'D THINK,
"THERE MUST BE A REASON." YOU WOULDN'T COME TO FIND ME?
HMM. THAT MAKES ME NEVER WANT TO COME HERE.
THEN I TELL MYSELF,
"HE SPENDS ALL DAY SEARCHING.
"HE SPENDS ALL DAY SEARCHING. IN THE NIGHT HE WANTS TO BE FOUND."
I DO. I DO WANT YOU TO FIND ME.
I DO WANT TO BE FOUND.
AH. I WAS LOOKING FOR LIEUTENANT SINGH.
AH. I WAS LOOKING FOR LIEUTENANT SINGH. HE'S SLEEPING. ONLY, WE BETTER GO TO WORK.
ONLY, WE BETTER GO TO WORK. I'LL TELL HIM.
WHAT IS IT? IS IT A MINE? IT'S A BOMB, UP BY THE VIADUCT.
OHH... DOES HE HAVE TO GO?
DOES HE HAVE TO GO? BEG PARDON?
WHAT IF YOU COULDN'T FIND HIM? SERGEANT, NOT TODAY, NOT THIS MORNING.
SERGEANT, NOT TODAY, NOT THIS MORNING. WHAT'S HAPPENING? AM I NEEDED? AFRAID SO, SIR.
DON'T GO. I'M FRIGHTENED.
THIS IS WHAT I DO.
I DO THIS EVERY DAY.

Almásy: HANA...HANA TELLS ME YOU'RE LEAVING.
Almásy: HANA...HANA TELLS ME YOU'RE LEAVING. Caravaggio: THERE'S GOING TO BE TRIALS.
THEY WANT ME TO INTERPRET.
THEY WANT ME TO INTERPRET. DON'T THEY KNOW I'M ALLERGIC TO COURTROOMS?
SO...
I COME ACROSS THE HOSPITAL CONVOY.
I'M LOOKING FOR THIS STUFF.
I'M LOOKING FOR THIS STUFF. THIS NURSE, MARY,
THIS NURSE, MARY, TELLS ME ABOUT YOU AND HANA
TELLS ME ABOUT YOU AND HANA HIDING IN SOME MONASTERY IN--
HIDING IN SOME MONASTERY IN-- WHAT YOU CALL IT? RETREAT?
WHAT YOU CALL IT? RETREAT? HOW YOU CAME OUT OF THE DESERT,
AND YOU WERE BURNED, AND YOU DIDN'T REMEMBER YOUR NAME,
AND YOU DIDN'T REMEMBER YOUR NAME, BUT YOU KNEW THE WORDS TO EVERY SONG THAT EVER WAS, AND YOU HAD ONE POSSESSION--
A COPY OF HERODOTUS.
AND IT WAS FILLED WITH LETTERS AND CUTTINGS.
THEN I KNEW IT WAS YOU.
ME?
I SAW YOU... WRITING IN THAT BOOK AT THE EMBASSY IN CAIRO...
WHEN I HAD THUMBS
AND YOU HAD A FACE...
AND A NAME. I SEE.
BEFORE YOU WENT OVER TO THE GERMANS.
BEFORE YOU WENT OVER TO THE GERMANS. BEFORE YOU FOUND A WAY
TO GET ROMMEL'S SPY ACROSS THE DESERT AND INSIDE BRITISH HEADQUARTERS.
HE TOOK SOME PRETTY GOOD PHOTOGRAPHS. I SAW MINE IN THAT TORTURE ROOM IN TOBRUK.
IN THAT TORTURE ROOM IN TOBRUK. SO...
IT MADE AN IMPRESSION.
IT MADE AN IMPRESSION. I HAD TO GET BACK TO THE DESERT.
I'D MADE A PROMISE. THE REST OF IT MEANT NOTHING TO ME.
THE REST OF IT MEANT NOTHING TO ME. WHAT DID YOU SAY?
THE REST...
MEANT NOTHING TO ME. THERE WAS A RESULT TO WHAT YOU DID.
THERE WAS A RESULT TO WHAT YOU DID. IT WASN'T JUST ANOTHER EXPEDITION.
IT WASN'T JUST ANOTHER EXPEDITION.
IT DID THIS. IF THE BRITISH HADN'T UNEARTHED THAT PHOTOGRAPHER,
IF THE BRITISH HADN'T UNEARTHED THAT PHOTOGRAPHER, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COULD HAVE DIED.
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COULD HAVE DIED. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DID DIE.
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DID DIE. JUST DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
LIKE MADOX?
WHAT? YOU KNOW HE SHOT HIMSELF-- YOUR PARTNER--
YOUR PARTNER-- WHEN HE FOUND OUT YOU WERE A SPY.
WHAT? KILLED... MADOX THOUGHT I WAS A SPY?
MADOX THOUGHT I WAS A SPY?
NO. NO, I WAS NEVER A SPY.
Madox: IT'S GHASTLY. IT'S LIKE A WITCH HUNT.
IT'S LIKE A WITCH HUNT. ANYBODY REMOTELY FOREIGN IS SUDDENLY A SPY. IT'S A WITCH HUNT.
IS SUDDENLY A SPY. IT'S A WITCH HUNT. RIGHT.
WE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT COUNTRIES, DID WE?
WE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT COUNTRIES, DID WE? BRITS, ARABS, HUNGARIANS, GERMANS.
HUNGARIANS, GERMANS. NONE OF THAT MATTERED, DID IT? IT WAS SOMETHING FINER THAN THAT.
YES, IT WAS.
I'LL LEAVE THE PLANE IN KUFRA OASIS.
I'LL LEAVE THE PLANE IN KUFRA OASIS. SO IF YOU NEED IT...
RIGHT. HARD TO KNOW HOW LONG ONE'S TALKING ABOUT. WE MIGHT ALL BE BACK IN A MONTH OR TWO.
I HAVE TO TEACH MYSELF NOT TO READ TOO MUCH INTO EVERYTHING.
COMES OF TOO LONG HAVING TO READ SO MUCH INTO HARDLY ANYTHING AT ALL.
GOOD-BYE, MY FRIEND.
THERE IS NO GOD.
BUT I HOPE SOMEONE LOOKS AFTER YOU.
IN CASE YOU'RE STILL WONDERING...
THIS IS CALLED A SUPERSTERNAL NOTCH.
COME AND VISIT US IN DORSET WHEN ALL THIS NONSENSE IS OVER.
YOU'LL NEVER COME TO DORSET.
Caravaggio: SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW MADOX SHOT HIMSELF?
NO.
NO. AND YOU DIDN'T KILL THE CLIFTONS?
NEVER...
SHE...
SHE'S DONE...
SHE...
MAYBE...
MAYBE I DID.
Almásy: I WAS PACKING UP OUR BASE CAMP AT THE CAVE OF THE SWIMMERS.
AT THE CAVE OF THE SWIMMERS. CLIFTON OFFERED TO FLY DOWN FROM CAIRO TO COLLECT ME.
TO COLLECT ME. HE FLEW LIKE A MADMAN ALWAYS,
HE FLEW LIKE A MADMAN ALWAYS, SO I TOOK NO NOTICE.
KATHARINE.
DEAR GOD, KATHARINE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? CAN'T GET OUT. CAN'T MOVE.
SURPRISE, HE SAID.
HE KNEW. HE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALL THE TIME.
HE WAS SHOUTING, "I LOVE YOU, KATHARINE. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH."
IS HE BADLY HURT?
I HAVE TO GET YOU OUT.
I HAVE TO GET YOU OUT. PLEASE DON'T MOVE ME. I HAVE TO GET YOU OUT.
I HAVE TO GET YOU OUT. IT HURTS TOO MUCH.
MY DARLING, I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
NOW...
WHY DID YOU HATE ME?
WHY DID YOU HATE ME? WHAT?
DON'T YOU KNOW YOU DROVE EVERYBODY MAD?
SHH.
DON'T TALK. YOU SPEAK SO MANY BLOODY LANGUAGES, AND YOU NEVER WANT TO TALK.
YOU'RE WEARING THE THIMBLE.
OF COURSE.
YOU IDIOT.
I ALWAYS WEAR IT.
I'VE ALWAYS WORN IT. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.
IT'S SO COLD.
IT'S SO COLD. I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
I'LL MAKE A FIRE.
DID YOU GET GEOFFREY OUT OF THE PLANE?
YES, I DID. GOOD. THAT'S GOOD. THANK YOU.
LISTEN TO ME, KATHARINE.
YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR ANKLE, AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TRY AND BIND IT.
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TRY AND BIND IT. I THINK YOU'VE ALSO BROKEN YOUR WRIST...
I THINK YOU'VE ALSO BROKEN YOUR WRIST... AND MAYBE SOME RIBS. WHICH IS WHY IT'S HURTING YOU TO BREATHE.
WHICH IS WHY IT'S HURTING YOU TO BREATHE. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO WALK TO EL TAJ.
ALTHOUGH GIVEN... ALL THE TRAFFIC
IN THE DESERT THESE DAYS,
I AM BOUND TO... BUMP INTO ONE ARMY OR ANOTHER.
BUMP INTO ONE ARMY OR ANOTHER. AND THEN I'LL COME BACK,
AND THEN I'LL COME BACK,
AND YOU'LL BE FINE. YOU PROMISE?
I WOULDN'T WANT TO DIE HERE. I DON'T WANT TO DIE IN THE DESERT.
I'VE ALWAYS HAD RATHER AN ELABORATE FUNERAL IN MIND.
PARTICULAR HYMNS.
PARTICULAR HYMNS. AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I WANT TO BE BURIED.
IN OUR GARDEN WHERE I GREW UP...
WITH A VIEW OF THE SEA.
WITH A VIEW OF THE SEA. PROMISE ME YOU'LL COME BACK FOR ME.
I PROMISE...
I PROMISE... I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU.
I PROMISE...
I PROMISE... I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU.
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF WATER.
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF WATER. AND, UM...FOOD.
I'LL OPEN THEM FOR YOU.
A GOOD READ.
DON'T WASTE THIS.
WOULD YOU BURY GEOFFREY?
I KNOW HE'S DEAD.
I'M SORRY, KATHARINE.
I KNOW.
EVERY NIGHT...
I CUT OUT MY HEART.
BUT IN THE MORNING IT WAS FULL AGAIN.
DARLING...

ALL RIGHT, GO ON, THEN.
HERE, YOU TAKE HIM. I'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN THIS BLOODY TRAIN ALL DAY.
DOESN'T OPEN.
SO, YES...
SHE DIED BECAUSE OF ME.
BECAUSE I LOVED HER.
BECAUSE I...
BECAUSE I HAD THE WRONG NAME.
AND YOU NEVER GOT BACK TO THE CAVE? I DID GET BACK.
I DID GET BACK. I KEPT MY PROMISE.
I WAS ASSISTED BY THE GERMANS.
I WAS ASSISTED BY THE GERMANS. THERE WAS A TRADE.
THERE WAS A TRADE. I HAD OUR EXPEDITION MAPS,
I HAD OUR EXPEDITION MAPS, AND AFTER THE BRITISH MADE ME THEIR ENEMY,
AND AFTER THE BRITISH MADE ME THEIR ENEMY, I GAVE THEIR ENEMY OUR MAPS.
I GAVE THEIR ENEMY OUR MAPS.
SO I GOT BACK TO THE DESERT AND TO KATHARINE,
IN MADOX'S ENGLISH PLANE
WITH GERMAN GASOLINE.
WHEN I ARRIVED...
IN ITALY, ON MY MEDICAL CHART
ON MY MEDICAL CHART THEY WROTE, "ENGLISH PATIENT."
THEY WROTE, "ENGLISH PATIENT." ISN'T THAT FUNNY?
AFTER ALL THAT, I BECAME ENGLISH.
YOU GET TO THE MORNING, AND THE POISON LEAKS AWAY, DOESN'T IT?
BLACK NIGHTS.
I THOUGHT I WOULD KILL YOU. YOU CAN'T KILL ME.
I DIED YEARS AGO.
NO, I CAN'T KILL YOU NOW.
WE'VE BEEN POSTED. NOT TO FLORENCE.
I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY...
YESTERDAY...
THE PATIENT AND HARDY.
THEY'RE EVERYTHING THAT'S GOOD ABOUT ENGLAND.
I COULDN'T EVEN SAY WHAT THAT WAS.
WE DIDN'T EXCHANGE 2 PERSONAL WORDS...
AND WE'D BEEN TOGETHER THROUGH SOME TERRIBLE THINGS.
THROUGH SOME TERRIBLE THINGS. SOME TERRIBLE THINGS.

Caravaggio: HANA...
THIS IS GIOIA.
-How? -Be the only one with a sword.
Easy.
Give him a hand, he fought well.
Well done, John.
Winner takes all, my friends. Winner takes all.
One more challenger and I'll be on my way.
Once in a lifetime, there comes a fighter so powerful...
...so fast, so fearless, that no man can touch him.
And while you're waiting for him to come along, you can practice on me.
You can take him on.
As sure as the sun will rise tomorrow...
...somewhere there's a man who's better than me.
Could be here. Could be today.
Go on. Yeah.
It could be you.
-He looks strong. Is he good? -Try him and see.
Go on, Mark. Only don't hurt him.
-So you're Mark, are you? -That's my name.
I'm Lancelot.
You ready?
Ready.
Well, you don't have to kill me to win, you know.
-Right. Got tight hold of your sword? -Don't you worry about that.
-Good. Can I give you some advice? -What's that?
Don't drop your sword.
Is this your sword? Well done. Give him a hand.
-Well done, Mark. -How did you do that?
How did he do that?
Was that a trick?
No, no trick. It's the way I fight.
Could I do it?
Tell me. I can learn.
Study your opponent so you know what he's gonna do before he does it.
I can do that.
You have to know that one moment in every fight...
...when you win or when you lose, and how to wait for it.
I can do that.
And you have to not care whether you live or die.
Something's going on.
Come on. Quickly. Quickly.
-Quickly. Hurry. Quickly. -Come on.
Get in. Come on, get into the back. Get in the back.
Shut the doors. Shut the doors.
Faster.
Where's Daddy?
Burn it down.
We'll be burnt alive.
We need water. Get water.
-Don't open the doors till they've gone. -We'll all be dead by then.
Malagant.
Last night, men from this village crossed the border...
...and killed three of my people.
In reprisal, I have destroyed your village.
The borderlands have been lawless long enough.
Know now that I am the law.
Quickly, now.
Mommy!
Come on.
Over here.
Go on, take it. Take it.
There she is.
Mind the dog.
-Over here, milady. Come here. -Wait one moment.
-Milady.... -I know. I won't be much longer.
There's been another attack, milady. Another border village burnt.
Anne, take my place.
-Milady. -Thank you, Jacob.
-Is it Malagant again? -Yes, milady.
A small group got away. They've just arrived.
-Are they being looked after? -They want to see you first, milady.
No, no, no, please.
Please, my poor people, after such a terrible journey, please.
We didn't know where else to turn, milady.
Our homes are gone. They've destroyed everything.
They say we're outlaws. They say we crossed the border.
-We don't dare cross the border. -I know, I know. It's lies, all lies.
He means to frighten us into submission.
Don't give in to him, milady. We'll fight, every last one of us.
Don't worry, I'm not the yielding kind.
-Jacob. -Milady?
Take these good people in and give them food and drink.
This evening, when you've rested...
...we shall all pray together for your village and for Lyonesse.
-God keep you safe, milady. -And you. Now go.
It is the third border village he's burned in a week.
What is it he wants, to destroy the world and be king of a graveyard?
He wants us to sign his treaty.
He thinks because my father's dead no one will stand up to him.
Milady, even if your father were alive--
If Prince Malagant doesn't get what he asks...
...he has the power to take it.
Well, Oswald?
You say nothing.
You know what I think, child.
Yes, I suppose I do.
Prince Malagant must be answered, milady.
He will be. I shall decide today.
Now leave me. Oswald, stay.
I had hoped to have more time.
How much time does it take to know your own heart?
Oh, I know what I want. I want to marry...
Oh, I know what I want. I want to marry... ...and I want to live and die in Lyonesse.
But I can't have everything I want, can I?
Forgive me, child...
...but an offer of marriage from Arthur of Camelot....
Yes, I know. You're right, of course.
So no more words.
-Let it be done. -You accept the offer?
I shall marry Arthur of Camelot.
My dear child...
...I was so proud to hold you in my arms at the hour of your birth.
I shall be prouder still to see you wed.
Poor Arthur.
The only dowry I bring him is a land in danger.
-But I shall love him, Oswald. -You should, child.
I could never marry a man without love. I've always known that.
Arthur wears his power so lightly...
...has such gentleness in his eyes.
I've never known anyone like him, Oswald.
How could I love anyone more?
Halt!
It could be an ambush. Look to the trees. Look to the trees. Knights take position. Watch all sides.
Knights take position. Watch all sides.
Knights to position.
-Protect the carriage. -Move to the left.
Circle in.
Don't break the line.
Wait. Wait.
Now!
Follow! Follow!
It's all right. It's all right.
They're going.
Steady now.
Wait.
Watch your flank.
We've got to jump. Come on, Elise.
-Get up there. -Roll when you hit the ground.
Petronella, come on.
-Come on, you have to. -No, I can't.
Hurry.
-Save yourself. It's me they'll follow. -No, I can't.
She must have gone to ground.
She can't be far.
There.
Don't move.
-Who are you? -Who cares?
Kill him.
-What is it? -There were three.
Don't even breathe. You, drop the sword.
All right. But can I have her when you're finished with her?
-You were after the woman? -Of course.
Have you ever seen anything so beautiful in your whole life?
-I don't know about that. -Don't tell me you don't want her.
Her soft skin, sweet lips, young firm body.
-I have my orders. -So? Who's to know?
No. I should take her back.
How about I hold her for you, you hold her for me?
It won't take long.
I don't want any trouble.
This one's no trouble. Look at her. She wants it, all right.
-What's she doing? -See for yourself. Turn her around.
Look into her eyes. See what she's got for you.
Oh, pretty. Pretty.
Now, what have you got for me, then?
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
-Why did you risk your life for me? -I didn't.
-They could have killed you. -I'm not that easy to kill.
-Do you know who I am? -Who are you?
Guinevere. I'm the lady of Lyonesse.
-Well? -Well what?
Doesn't it please you to know you saved the life of a lady?
I'd be just as pleased if you were a dairy maid.
A dairy maid couldn't reward you as I can.
If she was as pretty as you, she could give me all the reward I wanted.
-What did I do? -Insulted me.
Now I've insulted you.
How dare you? How dare you treat me like this?
I take it you know no better.
You have done me a good service and I shall forget the matter.
-Which way? -Don't know.
I've never been in this forest before.
Then how do you know it's leading to the road?
-I'm guessing. -Guessing?
See the scavenger birds?
They're looking for small animals crushed by the passing wagons.
It's not far now.
About this reward....
My man will pay you when we find my escort.
I don't want money.
I think you should know I'm on my way to be married.
If you're on your way to be married, you're not married yet.
Not married yet, you're free.
I've given my word.
I don't want your word. I want you.
I'm not to be had for the wanting, sir.
Why not? If I want you, you want me....
You may find this childish arrogance impresses servant girls....
I can tell when a woman wants me.
I can see it in her eyes.
Not in my eyes.
-You're afraid, aren't you? -I have nothing to hide.
Then look at me.
If there is any honor in you...
...promise me never to do that again.
I don't know about honor...
...but I promise you...
...I won't kiss you again until you ask me to.
And that I never will.
When do you get married?
On Midsummer's Day.
Before Midsummer's Day dawns, you'll ask me to kiss you again.
You insult me then you abandon me?
That's the road ahead.
And that, I presume, is your brave escort.
My child. Oh, thank the dear Lord.
-Are my ladies safe? -Yes, yes.
-Were you followed, milady? -No.
No, there's no one there.
Your new country awaits you, child.
-If anything should happen at home.... -I'll send word. Never fear. Send Jacob. I want to know at once, good news or bad. Promise me.
Send Jacob. I want to know at once, good news or bad. Promise me.
I promise you.
Lady Guinevere of Lyonesse. Welcome to Camelot.
God be praised, you're safe. Nothing shall ever harm you again.
My lord honors me with his kindness.
Your coming brings me a happiness I had not dared hope for.
My lord mustn't think too highly of me else I'm afraid he'll be disappointed.
You feel that too?
Then I shall just take you as I find you, if you'll do as much for me.
Well, Lyonesse will want to know if you've arrived safety.
John here will take any message you care to send.
My lord grants my wishes before I speak them.
Tell my people I'm come safe into my new country.
Tell them you saw my eyes filled with tears of joy.
Already a queen.
Up!
-Agravaine, what happened? -Ambush, sire.
-Malagant? -Has to be.
-Was Lady Guinevere in danger? -We were all in danger, sire. It was a well-planned attack. Two separate forces.
It was a well-planned attack. Two separate forces.
Lady Guinevere was in danger in the course of the second--
You weren't prepared for the second attack?
They'd lost so many men in the first strike, sire...
...how could we guess they had a second force standing by?
...how could we guess they had a second force standing by? Malagant doesn't care how many men he loses, so long as he wins.
Malagant doesn't care how many men he loses, so long as he wins.
I'll not fail you again, sire.
We fought enough battles together to know that no one is perfect...
-...but I need to know everything. -Sire.
Come.
I was still a boy when I first climbed this hill...
...and saw what was to become my city.
I named it Camelot.
It's so beautiful it almost frightens me.
Why do you say that?
I was brought up to set no faith in finery.
"Beauty doesn't last," my father always said.
Well, yes, but I remember the way he looked at you...
...and I remember him saying:
"Do all fathers think their daughters are so beautiful?"
He never said that to me.
Camelot.
Lady Guinevere!
Hey, good girl. Good girl.
Thank you.
Thank you. You saved me from a long ride.
God knows where she would have stopped.
-She's a fine animal. -Fit for a queen, if she wants her wild.
-I'm Peter. King's stableman. -Lancelot. Which king?
Which king? The king. Arthur of Camelot.
This beauty's supposed to be a gift for his new bride.
After all these years, there's those that swore he would never marry...
After all these years, there's those that swore he would never marry... ...but I knew better.
He was just waiting for the right one. Like we all do.
There'll be some feasting today, I can tell you.
Come on. The party's started.
Ready?
Come on, beat the gauntlet and meet the king.
Which one of you out there's got the heart of a lion?
Be the first to get right away through the gauntlet...
...and you'll be up there drinking ale as if he's your brother.
Come on. Get up here. Get padded up and beat the gauntlet.
What about you boys out there? Yes.
Give your support to this brave young man.
God save the king.
Beat the gauntlet and meet our lovely queen.
Will you give the victor a kiss, milady?
How's that, boys?
Beat the gauntlet and you win a kiss from the Lady Guinevere...
...soon to be our lovely queen.
Who will it be?
Look at that.
Not like that, idiot. No. Come and get padded up first.
Get down. You're mad. You'll kill yourself.
Look at that.
Go on.
Yes.
-Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. -Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.
Extraordinary. Unbelievable. What's your name?
Lancelot. Lancelot. We won't forget that name.
Lancelot. We won't forget that name.
Your prize.
Ask me.
No.
Ask me.
Never.
I dare not kiss so lovely a lady.
I only have one heart to lose.
Come.
Well done.
-Had you ever run the gauntlet before? -No, never.
So how did you do it?
It's not hard to know where danger is if you watch it coming.
Well, others have found it hard enough.
You're the first one to do it.
Perhaps fear made them go back when they should have gone forward.
-And you felt no fear? -No. I have nothing to lose.
-No home, family? -No.
-Do you have a profession? -I live by my sword.
-You fight for pay. -Yes.
Nobody paid you to run the gauntlet.
I knew I could do it, so I did it.
Well, Lancelot, you're an unusual man.
I don't believe I've ever seen such a display of courage, skill...
...nerve, grace and stupidity.
Come.
Here we believe every life is precious, even the lives of strangers.
If you must die, die serving something greater than yourself.
Better still, live and serve.
-The Round Table. -Yes.
This is where the high council of Camelot meets.
No head, no foot. Everyone equal, even the king.
"In serving each other, we become free."
That is the very heart of Camelot.
Not these stones, timbers, towers, palaces.
Burn them all and Camelot lives on.
Because it lives in us. It's a belief we hold in our hearts.
Well, no matter.
Stay in Camelot. I invite you.
Thank you, but I'll be on the road again soon.
What road?
Wherever a chance takes me. I have no plans.
So you believe that what you do is a matter of chance?
Yes.
At the end of that hallway, there are two doors...
...one to the left, one to the right.
How will you decide which door to take?
Left or right, it makes no difference. It's all chance.
Then I hope chance leads you to the left...
...because it's the only way out.
Lancelot.
Just a thought.
A man who fears nothing is a man who loves nothing.
And if you love nothing, what joy is there in your life?
I may be wrong.
Peter. Show us how she goes.
She's yours.
She's beautiful.
Peter thinks she's not suitable for a lady.
She's just the horse I would have chosen for myself.
-I know. -How do you know?
Remember last spring at Lyonesse...
...when you joined your father and me on the hunt?
You were fearless.
My father's word was "reckless."
Yes, well, he was always sparing with his praise.
Come.
So much space, we could almost be alone.
-Do you have secrets to tell me? -No.
No secrets. Just a question to ask.
Do you want to marry me?
My lord.
You don't have to marry me because your father wanted it...
...or because your country needs it.
Camelot will protect Lyonesse, whether you marry me or not.
Thank you.
You don't know what it means to me to hear you say that.
So you want to be released from the engagement?
No. I want to marry you.
Not your crown or your army or your golden city. Just you.
-Just me? -Yes. If you love me.
-Do you remember this? -Of course.
You hurt it on the thorn bush. Hadn't thought it'd leave such a scar.
Just a scratch and it bled like a war wound.
I remember.
You took my hand in yours and wiped the blood with a sleeve of your dress.
The sleeve still carries the stain.
I never thought until that moment...
...how sweet it must be to be loved by one woman.
And for the first time in my life, I wanted....
What?
Oh, what all wise men say doesn't last.
What cannot be promised or made to linger any more than sunlight...
...but I don't want to die...
...without having felt its warmth on my face.
Marry the king, Guinevere, but love the man.
I only know one way to love, my lord.
And that is body and heart and soul.
I kiss the hurt that brought me your love.
Try her.
-Shall I fetch her lady's saddle? -No need.
-She's a rare beauty, sire. -Yes, she is.
So is the mare.
May God grant us the wisdom to discover the right...
...the will to choose it... ...and the strength to make it endure. Amen.
Amen.
My friends, as you all know, I am soon to be married.
-And about time too. -Hear, hear.
We have had our share of war. Now I look forward to quieter days.
But first...
...admit our guest.
Malagant.
Prince Malagant is here at my invitation.
May I congratulate the king on his forthcoming marriage.
I see my place hasn't been taken yet.
To think that I was once first among your knights.
You left this council of your own free will.
We each of us must follow our own road... ...and mine had further to go.
...and mine had further to go.
And where does your road take you, Malagant? To Lyonesse?
Lyonesse is my neighbor.
I've offered the lady a treaty of friendship.
I still await an answer.
You call burning villages an act of friendship?
Well, yes, milady. Since your honored father's death...
...your land has been more lawless by the day.
Were you yourself not attacked on the road here?
-You know who attacked me. -I made it my business to know.
The bandits have been hunted down. Justice has been done.
What justice? You know no law higher than yourself.
"Armed forces to be given access to all Lyonesse.
Troops to assist in the enforcement of law in all Lyonesse."
-Do you want to sign this? -I'll never sign it.
There's your answer. She says no.
She's very brave...
...now she's to be married.
So is Lyonesse to come under the protection of Camelot?
Is Lyonesse in need of protection?
Come, Arthur.
I'm here to settle this business.
We both know Lyonesse is too weak to stand alone.
Let's say half each.
The lesser gives way to the greater...
...and what nation could be greater than Camelot...
...the land of justice and the hope of mankind?
Come, your hand on it. We'll all live together as friends.
You offer me what isn't yours to give.
You all know me.
You know I'm a man of my word.
Don't make an enemy of me.
I mean no harm to Camelot.
You know the law we live by.
And where is it written "Beyond Camelot live lesser people...
...people too weak to protect themselves, let them die"?
Other people live by other laws, Arthur.
Or is the law of Camelot to rule the entire world?
There are laws that enslave men and laws that set them free.
Either what we hold to be right and good and true...
...is right and good and true for all mankind under God...
...or we're just another robber tribe.
Your fine words are talking you out of peace and into war.
There's a peace that's only to be found on the other side of war.
If that battle must come, I will fight it.
-And I. -And I.
And I.
The great Arthur and his great dream.
No dream lasts forever.
What is the status of the army?
We have battalions under arms, two in reserve.
I'll double the watch on all gates.
Sire, I don't believe Malagant wants war with Camelot.
Arm the reserves. He wants war and he thinks he can win.
-He wants Lyonesse as a buffer. -He wants Camelot. He always has.
How soon could he attack?
There's no army within five days' march of Camelot.
So much for my quieter days.
Who approaches there?
I come from Lyonesse with a message for Lady Guinevere.
Enter.
-Milady, it's Jacob. -Jacob? Where?
-Coming to the north gate. -Lyonesse....
Jacob?
-Mind the step, milady. -Jacob, what is it? What's happened?
Sound the alarm!
They've taken Lady Guinevere!
Get on it.
Go! Go! Let's go!
Taken? Taken where?
-What happened? -A boat. The north gate.
-In which direction was she taken? -The forest.
I have scouts out already, sire, and dogs.
-Give me a battalion of guards. -No.
-Give me the men and I'll get her back. -No, that's exactly what he wants.
-Take one brigade, now. -Sire.
He'll not harm her, sire. She's too valuable.
He'll try to trade her to get what he wants.
That's what I'm afraid of, Agravaine.
I'd give my life for her...
...but what if he asks for more than I can give?
Welcome to my palace...
...milady.
I think we can release the lady from her bonds...
...if she so wishes.
What's this?
-Your dress is torn. Ralf. -Yes, my prince?
I gave orders that the lady was not to be harmed.
But, my prince, I didn't--
Your dress is quite spoiled, milady.
You...
...almost...
...a queen.
-Ralf. -My prince?
Did you do this?
-Yes, my prince. -You see?
This is what Arthur doesn't understand.
Men don't want brotherhood, they want leadership.
Shall we?
They say this was once the greatest castle ever built.
Now grass grows in the halls where kings once feasted...
...and peasants cart away the walls, stone by stone...
...to make shelters for their pigs.
-Such is glory. -What do you mean to do with me?
I mean to keep you here till Arthur becomes more reasonable.
He'll not trade Lyonesse for my life. I'd rather die and Arthur knows that.
Of course, self-sacrifice is very easy.
It's having to sacrifice someone you love...
...that puts your convictions to the test.
I'm sure you'll find Arthur will come round...
...to the merits of compromise.
This is what's called an "oubliette."
That's French for "a place of forgetting."
Your quarters, milady. No gates, no bars, no locks.
Just walls of air.
You can come out.
I'm unarmed and I'm alone.
-Who are you? -A messenger from the king.
-He came alone? -Yes, my prince.
So, what is your message?
I need to know that Lady Guinevere is unharmed first.
She's unharmed. I give you my word.
-I need to see with my own eyes. -My word isn't good enough for you?
I'm a common man, sir. I don't have much use for words.
He does have a message for me.
Take him to the pit, then bring him back.
Give me a chance to finish my food.
-All right, you've seen her. Let's go. -No.
You have orders to kill me... -...before I've delivered my message? -All right.
-...before I've delivered my message? -All right. We'll drag you back.
Jump on. Jump.
Down here. Get him.
Come on. Jump. Jump!
If the water can get out, so can we. Come on.
No. Hold on.
Come on. They're getting away!
Shoot.
Why have we stopped?
I'm tired.
Never.
You battle in your dreams.
What are you doing?
You'll see.
Now drink.
Again.
Where did you learn to do that?
Well, I've lived most of my life out in the open.
Don't you have a home?
No, I don't have a home.
Not for a long time.
-That must be hard. -Why? Why must it be?
I'm my own master. I go where I please.
I've nothing to lose.
Why build a house for the warlords to burn?
Is that how it happened?
God save you from such a day.
How old were you?
No!
Mother.
No.
Father.
No.
It was long ago.
God save us all from such a day.
He didn't save me.
But he did.
-For what? -It's made you who you are.
A man who fears nothing and no one.
You can use that gift for some good purpose.
If not, you might as well have died with the others.
You don't know how many times I've wished for that.
But you didn't die. You lived.
-Tell me what to do and I'll do it. -Your life is your own.
I give it to you.
You forget I'm to be married.
If you were free to do as you pleased...
...would you marry Arthur?
I am free. As free as you are.
-Prove it. -How?
Forget who you are. Let all the world go away...
...and all the people in it...
...but you and me.
Do what you want to do.
Here. Now.
On the other side.
You two, split up.
There she is.
Thank you, God.
Thank you.
Thank you. You can go.
I'm sure you have better things to do than dress me.
You have given me back my life itself.
The least I can do is give you your shirt.
My lord.
-Tell me what you want and it's yours. -I did what any man would have done.
No, no. You risked your life for another.
There is no greater love.
You have deceived me...
...but now I know the truth.
The truth is you care nothing for yourself.
Well, look at you. No wealth, no home, no goal...
...just the passionate spirit that drives you on.
God uses people like you, Lancelot...
...because your heart is open.
You hold nothing back, you give all of yourself.
If you knew me better, you wouldn't say such things.
Come on. I take the good with the bad, together.
I can't love people in slices. Now, no more protests.
Let me thank you in my own way.
They're welcoming you back.
We owe Lady Guinevere's life to one man.
Lancelot.
And I believe he comes to Camelot for a purpose...
...even though he doesn't know it himself.
And what I'm about to offer this man is already his.
One seat stands empty.
You'd make him a knight, sire?
What I offer is no life of privilege, but a life of service.
And if you want it, it's yours, with all my heart.
We don't know anything about him. They say he fights for money.
-Sire, perhaps we should discuss-- -Enough.
What do you say? Will you join us?
Milord, if I may speak?
I owe this man more than anyone here...
...and he deserves any honor you can give him.
But he doesn't belong in Camelot.
Lancelot's a man who goes his way alone...
...and in that freedom and solitude is his strength.
If you wish to honor him as I do from the bottom of my heart...
...then let's honor him as he is and not as we would make him.
Let him go, alone and free and with our love.
Well, Lancelot?
Lady Guinevere understands me well.
But here, among you... ...I have found something that I want more than freedom.
...I have found something that I want more than freedom.
I no longer know what life I am to live... ...only that it would break my heart to leave you.
...only that it would break my heart to leave you.
Oh, bravo. Then you'll join us?
-Yes. -Welcome.
This is only the beginning.
Go pass this night in prayer...
...for tomorrow at sunrise you'll be born again into a new life.
Why?
You know why.
-Please leave Camelot. -I want to be wherever you are.
You must not say such things to me.
-Well, what am I to say? -Nothing.
I will leave Camelot now if you come with me.
-No. -Then tell me you don't love me.
I don't love you.
Arise, Sir Lancelot.
Brother to brother, yours in life and death.
Brother to brother, yours in life and death.
Brother to brother...
-...yours in life and death. -Yours in life and death.
Brother to brother, yours in life....
Brother to brother, yours in life and death.
Brother to brother, yours in life and death.
Amen.
I swear to love and serve Guinevere, my true and rightful queen...
...and to protect her honor as my own.
I swear to love and serve Guinevere, my true and rightful queen...
...and to protect her honor as my own.
Jacob.
Forgive me, milady, but Malagant has taken Lyonesse.
Halt!
Lyonesse.
The gates are open.
-Make camp for the night. -Where, sire?
There.
It's too exposed, sire. We could never possibly defend--
Sire.
It's straw.
They're not here.
There's no one here.
Draw!
Loose!
Charge!
Attack. Attack.
-Archers in position, sire. -We hold position.
Their left wing's falling back, sire.
Second battalion into the left flank. Attack.
-Is our center holding? -Yes, sire.
Charge.
-They're breaking, sire. -Do not give chase. Hold your ranks.
-First battalion regrouped, sire. -Sound the advance.
-They're running, sire. Do we follow? -No, no. Let them go.
On to Lyonesse!
Well done.
Your sword, Sir Lancelot.
No.
No!
-Come out. -Come on.
-Lucky they're still alive. -Hold my arm. Hold my arm.
You're safe. Don't be afraid.
-Come along, miss. Take my arm. -I love you, milady.
-Yes, we're glad you're safe. -Thank you, Your Majesty.
Food and water for you all.
There's a step. Be careful.
Child, all the bad men are gone now. Take my arm, child.
It's all right, it's safe now.
God bless you, sir. God bless you.
It's all right now, Father. We're free, we're free.
-So old now. -Yes, we have water.
Can I go home now?
Can I go home now?
Yes.
Yes, you can go home now.
-Go to your mother. -Bless you, milady. Bless you.
Elise....
I've come to say goodbye...
...and wish you well.
It's been a long night. You've not slept.
Where will you go?
Don't know. Wherever the road leads.
And when shall we expect to see you again?
I don't think I'll be coming back.
Never?
Never.
See, I know what I must do now.
I never believed in anything before.
But I do believe in Camelot.
And I will serve it best by leaving.
Tell the king I'll always remember that he saw the best in me.
And what shall I tell myself?
That there was once a man who loved you too much to change you.
I'll not forget him.
I sheltered under a tree with him once...
...in the rain.
Lancelot.
My queen.
I owe you a kiss.
I'm asking you.
Why?
Why?
Why?!
The king asks for you, milady.
I ask you not to lie to me, even if you think you'll hurt me.
Have you given yourself to him?
No, my lord.
Do you love him?
Yes.
How did I fail you?
You've never failed me, my lord.
I saw your face as you kissed him.
Love has many faces.
I may look on you differently, but not with less love.
When a woman loves two men, she must choose between them.
I choose you.
Your will chooses me.
Your heart chooses him.
Then you have the best of it. My will is stronger than my heart.
Do you think I put so high a price on my feelings?
Feelings left for a moment and the moment passes.
My will holds me steady to my course through life.
As mine does me, and yet all I have to do is look at you...
...and everything I ever believed in fades to nothing.
And all I want is your love.
-You have it. -Do I?
Do I?
Then look on me as you looked on him.
I gave one moment to Lancelot.
Yes, you're innocent. But you love him!
Any more of this innocence and I'll go mad.
I'll do whatever you tell me to.
I don't know what to think or feel anymore.
I no longer see my way ahead.
Only fools dream of the one thing they can't have.
Forgive me.
What's to forgive?
I dreamed the dream of you.
It was a sweet dream...
...while it lasted.
-Unlock the door. -Sire.
-My lord? -I'll ask the questions.
Did you come to Camelot to betray me?
No, my lord.
You desired her. You pursued her.
-The queen is innocent. -Innocent?
I saw her in your arms.
I trusted you, loved you, and you betrayed me.
-I never meant to hurt you. -You leave me nothing. Nothing.
-My lord-- -No.
You will be charged with treason under our laws.
Defend yourself in court.
The law will judge you.
May God grant us the wisdom to discover the right...
...the will to choose it...
...and the strength to make it endure. Amen.
Amen.
I was mistaken in Lancelot. As a man, I may forgive.
As a king, I must see justice done.
There will be a public trial tomorrow at noon in the great square.
-Sire, the queen-- -In the great square?
Better to settle the matter in private, sire.
You think the honor of Camelot is a private matter?
Am I to hide in dark corners as if I'm ashamed?
Open the city gates. I want everyone there.
The people will know the truth.
Let every citizen see that the law rules in Camelot.
Guinevere, lady of Lyonesse, queen of Camelot...
...and Lancelot, knight of the high council...
...are charged in their own persons, and in collusion, one with the other...
...with dishonor to the realm...
...and violation of the king's rights under law.
These crimes constitute an act of treason... ...against the kingdom of Camelot...
...and the penalty under law is death.
Sir Lancelot may speak to the charges.
What I have to say is for the king alone.
My lord...
...the queen is innocent.
But if my life...
...or my death...
...serves Camelot...
...take it. Do what you like with me.
Brother to brother, yours in life and death.
Is it the king's wish that the queen be questioned by this court?
May God forgive me.
Is it the king's wish that the queen should be questioned by this court?
-Who goes there? -Who goes there?
-You on the roof, who goes there? -Guards!
Close the gates. Close the city gates.
Get back. Come on, now. Get back there.
Nobody move or Arthur dies.
My men control the city gates and every exit from this square.
On every roof, I have men with burning torches.
I have only to lift my arm and your golden city burns to ashes.
I am the law now.
You obeyed Arthur and now you'll obey me.
My people are unarmed, Malagant.
If it's me you want, here I am.
Look at him. Look at the great King Arthur of Camelot.
He's a man waking up from a dream.
The strong rule the weak.
That's how your God made the world.
God makes us strong only for a while, so that we can help each other.
My God makes me strong so I can live my life.
Arthur says to you, "Serve one another."
Well, when are you gonna start living for yourselves?
Now, this is the freedom I bring you.
Freedom from Arthur's tyrannical dream...
...freedom from Arthur's tyrannical law...
...freedom from Arthur's tyrannical god.
I want your people to see you kneel before me here.
-No. -No.
Kneel before me or die.
Too proud, Arthur?
You think you can better serve your people better dead?
I have no pride left in me.
What I do now I do for my people and for Camelot.
And may they forgive me.
This is my last act as your king.
Do not be afraid.
All things change.
I am Arthur of Camelot.
And I command you now, all...
...to fight! Fight like you've never fought before!
Never surrender! Never surrender! Fight like you've never--
No!
Camelot lives.
Burn it. Burn everything.
-Go! -Get him inside.
Careful.
Go on! Fight for Camelot!
Come on.
Fight for King Arthur! Fight for Camelot!
Sword.
Please, no!
You fool!
Camelot will never fall to the tyranny of Malagant.
-Is there no more we can do? -I'm sorry.
-Lancelot. -Yes, my lord?
-Where's my sword? -Here.
My truest...
...my first knight.
Camelot is your home now.
You are the future....
The future of Camelot.
You take care of her for me.
Take care of her.
I feel it now, my love.
There's 25, 30 warriors maybe.
A hundred women and children.
That's it. Here.
Hell, the warriors will turn and fight.
No avoiding that. [Al] Yup.
And give the women and children time to take cover.
[Al] One thing for damn sure they already know we're here.
-Captain Ragsdale. -[Ragsdale] Sir!
Troopers on the flat. Form a line.
-Mr. Ragsdale. -Sir.
Advance carbines.
Company, advance carbines!
Sound the march. Bugler!
[Britton Davis] The Chiricahua Apache from the American Southwest
were the last of the great tribes to defy the United States government,
in its effort to impose the reservation system.
The army, under the command of Brigadier General George Crook,
was entrusted with the responsibility of breaking this resistance.
His campaign into the Chiricahua strongholds below the Mexican border
brought to a conclusion the conflict
that had raged through the southwest for nearly two decades.
Tell Old Nana and the others we're not gonna hurt them.
We're not going anywhere.
We don't want to fight.
We came here to bring you to a reservation.
Tell your men that.
Nantan Lupan only wants peace with the Chiricahua.
Live on the reservation.
[Davis] Only one Chiricahua warrior and his band of renegades held out.
Then even he sent word that he would give himself up in two months' time.
He was called Goyakla.
But, years before, the Mexicans had given him another name,
Geronimo.
[Davis] One month before my 22nd birthday,
I reported for duty in the Arizona territory.
It was my first posting to garrison life.
And looking back, it is now clear to me that I was as much a stranger to myself
as I was to the Great Western desert.
My name is Britton Davis.
I was a participant in what the army later called the Geronimo Campaign.
It is my wish to throw some light
upon the extraordinary events that I witnessed,
and on the men that lived them.
The beginning of my life as a frontier soldier was at hand
and no amount of military training could disguise the excitement I felt.
Howdy. Welcome.
Always good to see an army fella.
Whiskey?
No, thank you, sir.
[chuckles] You don't have to "sir" me, son.
I ain't no officer.
Looks like you are, though. Second Lieutenant Britton Davis
at your service. Proud to know ya.
Where are you from, Lieutenant?
I was born in Texas, near Brownsville.
Texas? Well, son, I thought you was from back east.
Kinda got that manner about ya.
Well, I've been the last four years at West Point.
-Senor? -Yeah.
[Davis] My initial impression of First Lieutenant Charles Gatewood
remains distinct in my memory.
His brusqueness was entirely military, balanced by unfailing good manners.
In his most matter-of-fact way, he gave me my first order as an officer of the United States cavalry.
he gave me my first order as an officer of the United States cavalry.
I was to accompany him south.
We were going to bring in Geronimo.
He's due in a few days.
We'll go on down to the border and escort him to San Carlos.
That's 75 miles to the border from here, Mr. Davis.
Plenty of time to get acquainted with your new mount.
-Sir? -Yes?
Just you and me?
The General figured that with Geronimo with us, we didn't need much protection.
Yes, sir.
A small detachment means we're not threatenin' the hostiles.
You wouldn't want to pose a threat to Geronimo now, would you, Mr. Davis?
No, sir.
[Davis] The lieutenant was clearly a man of confidence
and experience in the Apache wars.
In time, I came to realize he was much admired by his peers,
much respected by his superiors.
[Gatewood] That's the border, Mr. Davis.
How will he find us? [Gatewood] Easy. We're the only ones out here.
Lieutenant?
Apache medicine man.
Probably on a pilgrimage.
The Apaches, they believe in their power. It's a kind of spirit they carry inside them.
It's a kind of spirit they carry inside them.
Sir. Geronimo's just gonna come on in and give himself up?
That's what he promised.
Chiricahua doesn't give his word much. But when he does, he keeps it.
As long as you keep yours.
[Davis] When the medicine man joined our camp, I was filled with curiosity.
By personal inclination, Lieutenant Gatewood kept his own counsel.
However, he met questions from an inexperienced officer
with patience and courtesy.
What fascinated me most
was his sympathy and knowledge of all things pertaining to the Apache.
You don't talk to them much, do you?
To an Apache, stillness is a pleasure.
It's somethin' they're taught while they're young.
Helps them when they may have to hide and wait.
What's he singing about?
Trying to locate Geronimo.
He says he'll be here tomorrow,
on a white horse.
Superstitious, aren't they?
Five dollars says he rides in here on a white horse.
Just because the medicine man says so?
You've got a bet, Lieutenant.
Question.
These scouts that we have with us, they're Apache.
Why would they work for the army? Fight against their own kind?
There are lots of different Apache tribes that don't much like each other.
Most of all, Apache go where the best fight is.
It's a morality once you understand it.
All right, I'll see your two,
and I'll raise you one.
Lieutenant, just curious, are you a family man?
I have a son and a daughter.
They and my wife are back in Virginia.
You must miss them. Every hour of every day.
Goyakla is coming. Rides a white horse.
You owe me five dollars, Mr. Davis.
[in Apache] I heard you were wearing the blue coat.
I did not believe it.
Now I know your heart.
First lieutenant, Charles B. Gatewood.
[in Apache] It is good to see the great warrior.
You speak pretty good Apache.
Second Lieutenant Britton Davis, 6th Cavalry.
[in English] You are now under the protection of the United States Army.
We will escort you to General Crook at San Carlos.
Nantan Lupan waits for you with an open heart.
They are something.
Chiricahua are special.
Even amongst the Apache.
[Davis] The second night of our trek to San Carlos,
we put up at the Overland Way station.
At the foot of the Dragoon Mountains.
The following morning, I had my first opportunity to write home,
being careful to include in the letter an offhand reference to my participation in the capture of Geronimo.
to my participation in the capture of Geronimo.
Two men are coming. Man with white hat carries shotgun.
I'm looking for the officer in charge.
Lieutenant Charles Gatewood, at your service.
I heard the army was traveling through with hostiles.
Especially one hostile in particular.
City Marshal, Joe Hawkins, Tombstone.
Apaches over yonder are under arrest.
I'm deputizin' you two to hold these criminals until we get back
with a posse and a warrant.
These Apache are in our custody.
The warrant's gonna specify the murder of white citizens,
horse thievery, and hostile Indianism. Now, is that good enough for you?
We wanna do what's right. Which is hang 'em. [snickers]
I have orders to turn these Apache in to General Crook.
And the United States Army doesn't need any help from you.
Lieutenant.
Don't sass me, bluecoat.
Great Geronimo.
Well, I think you're nothin' but a murderin' red bastard.
[Gatewood] I'd ride on if I were you, sir.
You seem to have provoked the hostiles.
And I don't think you wanna get into a contest with the 6th Cavalry.
Now, let me tell you somethin'.
Even the 6th Cavalry is subject to a federal warrant.
Justice will be served,
one way or the other.
Toothy.
Get the Apaches going, Mr. Davis.
-Now. -Sir.
[Davis] We moved north with all possible speed,
but our pack mules prevented us from making good progress.
Around 4 o'clock in the afternoon we caught sight of the Tombstone posse.
Faced with a potential enemy that possessed superior numbers,
Lieutenant Gatewood hit upon an unusual tactic.
He divided his forces,
sending me ahead with the others while he and Geronimo remained behind.
The lieutenant had two objectives,
first, to attempt a rear guard protective action.
Second, and most important, never to lose sight of Geronimo.
Easy, steady, steady.
What are you seein', Davy?
Looks like some of 'em split off.
Six or seven of 'em headed to San Carlos.
Other two up yonder.
That's more of a lynch mob than a posse.
But if they serve those warrants, I'm gonna have to give you up.
You have good long glass, Gatewood.
If I scare them off,
we trade.
I can't let you kill any of those men.
That was a great shot.
Not so great. I aimed for his head.
We best catch up to Mr. Davis and the others now.
This your name, Gatewood?
Yes. A gift from my troopers.
They must think you're a fine chief.
No, not a chief, just a soldier.
Your glass... much better than mine.
A blue stone is valuable to Apache.
Well, thank you.
[Davis] The following afternoon we arrived at the military base of operations at San Carlos.
we arrived at the military base of operations at San Carlos.
This afforded me my first glimpse of General Crook,
who the Apache called Nantan Lupan, Grey Wolf Chief.
Our arrival was laid out with great military ceremony.
The surrender of Geronimo was no small event.
General.
My compliments, Lieutenant.
Nantan Lupan. [sighs]
It does my heart good to see you, Geronimo.
I accept your surrender.
I accept the surrender of a great warrior.
Now let's have a cup of coffee and smoke a cigar.
We've got a lot to talk about.
It's old Geronimo.
[in English] Good to see you, ain't it?
You know my friend, Al Sieber.
I was always hopin' to catch up to you myself,
but guess I'll never get that chance now, will I?
Mr. Sieber. Lieutenant.
[Crook] I see you have your cigar and coffee.
Lieutenant Gatewood has reported to me about your trip up from the border.
It sounds like quite a story.
I'm glad to see that Geronimo is a man of his word.
Washington has ordered me to detain you here for a short period.
And then to send you and your band of Chiricahua on to Turkey Creek.
We keep our rifles for hunting.
Yes, but only on the reservation.
I'll put one of my officers in charge there.
Gatewood.
No, I'm sorry, Lieutenant Gatewood is a company officer.
He has his responsibilities here.
We take Davis.
I like Davis.
Well, I'm sure Mr. Davis is gonna make a fine officer,
but I had somebody more experienced in mind.
I like Davis.
What do you think, Lieutenant? Well, I'm sure it will be his privilege,
as well as his duty.
Mr. Davis it is.
To be accompanied by a small detachment of soldiers.
The Apache will be under the protection of the United States Army.
Mr. Davis is young.
Young Apache, young White-Eye, the hope of the west.
Gatewood,
you come visit me.
I would like that.
[Crook] I hope the wars are over, my friend.
Nantan Lupan wants the Chiricahua to learn to be farmers.
It's their only chance.
They must change.
The old days are gone.
Nantan Lupan says there must be no leaving this reservation.
Even for a few hours, without permission.
There must be no drinking of whiskey or tizwin.
Any violations of these rules
will result in confinement in an army prison stockade.
[in English] He want to know why these rules?
Why they be punished?
What you care if Apache drink? Soldier drink.
Nantan Lupan says if Apache drink... ...Apache fight, Apache get into trouble.
...Apache fight, Apache get into trouble.
It's bad for everyone. It's bad for the Apache,
It's bad for everyone. It's bad for the Apache, it's bad for soldiers, bad for all the White-Eyes.
it's bad for soldiers, bad for all the White-Eyes.
[in English] He say why if some Apache do bad things, all are punished?
That will not happen.
All Apache should not be punished for the mistakes of only a few.
We will determine who is responsible and only those few will be punished.
[Davis] Six weeks after I took up residence at Turkey Creek,
Lieutenant Gatewood and Al Sieber came to visit.
Sieber, as chief of scouts, was in charge of recruiting Apache for the Army.
Hello there, Mangas. Just the fella I want to see.
I want you to join the army, all right?
Wolves with bluecoats, scouts to help us fight the renegades.
Now you'll be a sergeant, wear a blue coat, stripes on your coat with army pay, all right?
wear a blue coat, stripes on your coat with army pay, all right?
I don't know, Sieber.
Well, you are a warrior, you hunt men.
You'll make your woman, make your children proud of you.
Mexicans, they take my wife, my little boy.
Well, maybe the army could help get 'em back.
I think maybe I stay here.
If I was asking you out on a raidin' party,
I expect you'd be a lot more willin', hey, Mangas?
[Davis] The federal government had forced over 500 Chiricahua
to take up residence within Turkey Creek's narrow borders.
Corn was the main crop,
but the land was not fertile enough for them to be self-sufficient.
The Chiricahua had become dependent
upon monthly allotments of government supplies for their well-being.
[Geronimo] Gatewood. You come to visit me.
Makes my heart glad to see Geronimo.
How's the life of a farmer?
Some Apaches are good farmer.
Others miss the old way.
I am not good farmer, Gatewood.
I've come here to visit my friend,
but I have some questions I need to ask you.
There are rumors that a medicine man is speakin' against the White-Eye.
That he is callin' for a return to the war trail.
It was told by a medicine man
many more Apache would die fighting White-Eye.
And in the end,
we will win because we will die free of them.
Is the only way for an Apache to be free,
to die?
Well, which medicine man is this? I should talk to him.
Find out what he's saying.
There are many.
Some have the power.
Some just talk.
He's a warrior, every bit born in battle.
Fightin' a lost cause.
I'm familiar with the type.
My two older brothers and my father fought for the army of Northern Virginia.
My oldest brother was killed.
My father was wounded, crippled.
After the war, he took me aside and said, "You'll carry the new flag."
Sent me off to the academy.
First in my family north of the Mason-Dixon line.
So, like our friend, I know what it's like to hate the bluecoat.
[in Apache] Before the White-Eye came we had a good life.
Now we are forced to stay on this tiny piece of land.
The White-Eye do not understand the way of the Apache.
The medicine man at Cibecue is called the Dreamer.
The medicine man at Cibecue is called the Dreamer. He says the dead chiefs will rise.
He say the Apache are the true keepers of the land.
I will go to him.
I want to hear his words.
Today while Gatewood talked to me, I looked into my power.
I saw a white horse running.
I saw the signs of war.
[Davis] Nothing so concentrated the bureaucratic mind in dealing with the Indians
the bureaucratic mind in dealing with the Indians as rumors of the troublesome medicine man.
When an occasional religious leader showed up among the tribes,
preaching doctrines perceived to be dangerous,
standard government policy was to have the army deal with it immediately.
I am here by order of General Crook,
Nantan Lupan.
[in Apache] The dead chiefs will not rise if you are here.
The White-Eye must leave. I pray this will happen.
This dance is a demonstration hostile to the citizens of the United States.
And this demonstration is unlawfully assembled.
I order you to stop at this instant!
Stop that. Stop him. Arrest him.
Watch it!
You didn't have to shoot him, goddamn it! I can handle this myself!
-[soldier] What's he got there? -He had a rock.
He has not done nothin'!
We're not botherin' no one.
You leave here. You leave us alone.
Arrest him. Arrest Geronimo!
[in Apache] Where is your heart?
[Captain] Arrest Geronimo. Arrest him.
-Near Dayton. -Yes, David never really me- General Crook, telegram, sir.
Pardon me.
Get a staff officer to me immediately.
Captain Ragsdale. Now.
General.
Geronimo has jumped Turkey Creek.
The Apache are out.
It all blew up at Cibecue.
The whole damn thing is a shambles.
Geronimo has taken half the reservation with him.
Men, women and children.
Spread the word. All officers to their commands.
Yes, sir.
[Davis] Geronimo had quickly divided his forces into small bands,
each headed for Mexico.
By the day after Cibecue, Crook had five columns in the field.
[Davis] The Geronimo campaign had begun.
[officer] On the point. Circle back!
Sir.
Yes, I see them, Mr. Davis.
Steady in the rank. Go slow.
Beg your pardon, sir.
Do we attack?
Hold the column.
Sergeant.
[Sergeant 1] Steady in the rank. Steady!
Sergeant. [Sergeant 1] Column, halt!
Whatever happens, the Apache will take off.
Don't let the column pursue at speed.
Whenever you can, you choose your ground to fight on.
Chato, what the hell is going on?
Raiding party split off from Goyakla.
Apache challenge Gatewood come out and fight.
Want to show off power to other Chiricahua.
Chato.
Is there anythin' that should be done?
[Davis] Geronimo's band had diverted to the east
into the copper mining country of the low hills.
His tactics were re-supplied at the expense of the civilians
who had settled on Chiricahua land.
[in English] This is Apache land.
This has always been Apache land.
[man] We ain't never done nothin' to you, uh... I mean, it ain't right, is it? [crying]
Stop cryin', damn it!
He's gonna kill you anyway.
We make things out of this country!
There was nothin' here before us, and there'd never be nothin' if we left it to you.
You are a fool!
But at least you are brave.
Get off Apache land.
The next time, I will kill you.
[soldier 1] Detail, halt!
[soldier 2] Troops, right, straight! [soldier 1] Left, right, face!
[Crook reading] "The Apache known as Dandy Jim and Skip Hey
have been found guilty by the military court, department of Arizona,
of insurrection at Cibecue Creek.
The Apache, dead shot,
sergeant, military scouts, 6th Cavalry,
has been found guilty of treason.
The sentence of the court for the three prisoners
is death by hanging."
Do any of you have anything to say to me as Chaplain?
Are any of you Christians?
Nantan Lupan,
I give you my hat.
Maybe you think... my wife, my baby.
[in Apache] Don't trust the White-Eye.
With them, there is no right way.
I am not afraid of their preacher.
The One God will welcome me.
There's three of them.
The driver should be nearby.
They didn't have to kill them just to get their horses.
No, they didn't.
[Davis] Al Sieber had had his wound from Cibecue cauterized with a hot poker,
and was back in the saddle the following day.
All told, he had suffered 17 gunshot and arrow wounds
in his many years of fighting Apache.
The General wants to deploy me and Dutchy to your column.
How's that wound, Mr. Sieber?
Which one?
I got them here, here, here, here.
Hell, I'm in real good. Ain't slowin' me down none. [chuckles]
We came across an overland. four dead, horses gone.
Well, they've burned two spreads off to the west.
They picked up horses, food, a lot of ammunition.
So, I figure I'll just keep trackin' off to those hills there. All right?
All right.
Mr. Davis, you and Sergeant Mulrey stick with Mr. Sieber.
Sir.
Be sure that he gets back to the column by sundown.
[Davis] Sir.
That raiding party is real, real close.
Yeah.
I want you to ride for the column
and bring 'em back to pick up this trail.
-On the double, pronto. Go on. Get outta here. -[man grunting]
You take him! Faster.
[Davis] The hostile Apache that Dutchy and I had been pursuing had gotten away.
Needless to say, at the time I was humiliated.
But much later, I decided the incident had come out for the best.
I'm quite content to go to my grave knowing that I've never killed an Apache.
[Gatewood] You all right, Mr. Sieber?
[Sieber] Caught up with three bucks and a string of stolen ponies.
Gave one of them to Mr. Davis. Seems he got away.
Sergeant Mulrey! Check the area for a dead hostile.
Sir.
Now, we crossing to Mexico tomorrow?
That's right.
I think we ought to send some of them scouts back
'cause I don't trust 'em down south of the border.
Geronimo's got a couple of them spooked, and they're startin' to wonder if they're on the wrong side.
and they're startin' to wonder if they're on the wrong side.
I don't think so, Mr. Sieber.
Besides, we need every scout we have.
Yes, sir.
I guess you weren't there then when they dead shot and the rest of 'em and turned on us at Cibecue.
when they dead shot and the rest of 'em and turned on us at Cibecue.
If I had been at Cibecue, they wouldn't have turned.
Whole thing wouldn't have happened, Al.
I know you don't like me much, Lieutenant. I don't really care.
I know I'm rough in some of my ways, I guess.
I ain't the gentleman type.
But, uh, I think, uh,
compared to you, I am somewhat honest.
No offense intended, Lieutenant. Speakin' off the record, sir.
I just, uh, figure you're a real sad case.
You don't love who you're fightin' for,
and you don't hate who you're fightin' against.
Perhaps, I could learn to hate with the proper vigor from you, Al.
Well, maybe you could, Lieutenant.
[Davis] Though I never managed to become a close friend of Al Sieber,
in the next few weeks of campaigning, I did learn to get along with him.
Only a fool would fail to profit from his vast experience.
I think, in his own way, he was as taken by the Apache as was Lieutenant Gatewood.
Well, sir,
your Apache rides a horse to death and eats him and steals another.
I mean, the horse is just mobile food.
I've chased them when they made 50 miles a day on horse and foot.
And hell, they can live on cactus, go 48 hours without water.
I mean, one week of that would kill your average trooper.
I hear you can track as good as any Apache.
Well, you heard right,
but there's only one of me and a thousand square miles of Apache country.
General Crook figured that out, 'cause it takes an Apache to catch an Apache.
White-Eyes can't catch 'em alone, no, sir.
If you ever get in a fight with Apache, things go bad,
If you ever get in a fight with Apache, things go bad, you save the last bullet for yourself.
You don't wanna get taken alive, no, sir.
They got lots of ways to kill you.
And one of their favorites is to strip you, tie you upside down to a wagon wheel.
They pour pitch on you, light you on fire.
[in Apache] I know you are angry about this war.
The White-Eye...
gave me no choice.
I ask your blessing.
You ask my blessing after this thing is done.
What I did is right.
Now we are fighting
Mexicans and White-Eye.
The reservation is bad, but at least we can stay alive.
We have fought the Mexicans for years...
and the White-Eye will never catch us.
Many Apache will die. I must send for Nantan Lupan.
We will talk with him. I ask that you do this.
[Davis] General Crook and a small detachment of Apache scouts
came across the border into the Canyon de Los Embudos.
Crook had agreed to negotiate terms, but he intended a hard bargain.
For the rest of his life, he never forgave Geronimo for jumping Turkey Creek.
Crook maintained his sympathy for the Apache,
but between he and Geronimo, all trust had vanished.
There is one God looking down on us all.
We are all children of one God.
I didn't come here to listen to religion.
You broke your word.
You left Turkey Creek.
You killed many White-Eye. You come back.
Washington wants you to go to Florida.
You do it or I'll come back with my army and fight.
Nantan Lupan does not understand.
The White-Eye tried to change Apache way.
The Apache were doing fine farming corn.
The problem was Geronimo.
I knew Cochise. He was a king.
He was a wise ruler of his people.
I knew Vittorio. He was a proud leader.
I know Geronimo,
who doesn't want to lead or rule or be wise.
He just wants to fight.
I didn't start this trouble.
The army killed the Dreamer.
He was calling for war.
If the medicine man had come in peaceably, he'd be alive.
There's no excuse for taking up arms against the United States Army.
The army is the best friend the Chiricahua ever had.
You know it and I know it.
With all this land, why is there no room for the Apache?
Why does the White-Eye want all land?
How long in Florida?
Maybe two years. With your families.
I think I can get that.
That's not a bad deal.
A lot of White-Eye want to see Geronimo hanged for murder.
Not murder. War.
Many bad things happen in war.
How many White-Eye did you kill since you left Turkey Creek?
Maybe 50.
Maybe more. How many Apaches did you kill?
You killed women and children.
So did you.
We gain nothing by fighting.
We can live on reservation.
I go there.
You, Nantan Lupan, are like a brother to me.
Many of my people want to surrender.
When I was young,
the White-Eye came and wanted the land of my people.
When their soldiers burnt our villages, we moved to the mountains.
When they took our food, we ate thorns.
When they killed our children,
we had more.
We killed all White-Eye that we could.
We starved and we killed,
but in our hearts we never surrendered.
[Davis] C.S. Fly, a photographer from Tombstone
had requested permission to accompany General Crook to Mexico
and record the negotiations.
Much to everyone's surprise, Crook agreed.
Even more surprising, Geronimo and the other Chiricahua also agreed.
In some mysterious way, they seemed to understand
In some mysterious way, they seemed to understand these pictures would make them immortal.
They remain the only known photographs ever taken of the American Indian
as an enemy in the field.
[in Apache] Old Nana and his people...
will return to Turkey Creek.
Many of his people are too old to fight.
Nantan Lupan will make all of you a prisoner.
We have to trust him.
There is no other way.
I called him my brother.
Go if you must. I have made my decision.
I will not surrender to the White-Eye.
I will stay with you and fight.
But now we will be very few.
"Thereby I tender my resignation as commander of this department.
I have served you well in the past, but my judgment has been called into question.
Without doubt, I made grievous error in trusting the word of Geronimo that he would surrender.
in trusting the word of Geronimo that he would surrender.
Perhaps others will be more correct or more fortunate.
The real tragedy, I know, you do not understand.
That is to the Apache people.
They've lost in me a true friend.
And they have few.
George Crook, Brigadier General, United States Army."
I was forced to send this to Washington a day ago.
They've accepted my resignation
with regrets.
General Nelson Miles will replace me.
There's nothin' to be done, General?
Nothing.
Graceful retirement for a General who could not catch Geronimo.
Settlers, prospectors, land speculators, they won't admit it.
But the truth is they'd all like to see the Indian dead.
They see the army as their weapon.
The army that fight the Apache is the only real hope of keeping the Apache alive.
Only the army can protect them.
Yes, sir.
I fought 'em a long time, General.
And I figure if I was one of 'em, I'd be standin' right next to Geronimo
shootin' at the bluecoats.
But God made me who I am. And between them or us, I figure it's us.
And between them or us, I figure it's us.
Damn it, Al, is that the only way we could win?
Well, I, I can't answer that question. Well, I'm just a hired hand.
I just want to say, General, I didn't always agree with you, but you had my respect.
I didn't always agree with you, but you had my respect.
And while you was in charge,
the army was a proper piece of work.
Yes, sir.
So, I'm gonna quit this damn fool job. I'm gonna go on down to Tucson...
and I'm gonna get drunk.
Take it easy, Al.
Yes, sir.
Al?
[Davis] General Miles brought with him an entirely new staff of line officers.
Lieutenant Gatewood, myself, and many others
had to taste the humiliation of being dismissed from the field.
I'm honored to be here with you men of the 6th Cavalry.
Honored to be here by order of the President of the United States.
We are charged with bringing in the renegade Apache Geronimo.
We will accomplish this task. We will succeed.
But we're abandoning certain practices of the past.
Over-reliance on Apache scouts,
men of divided loyalties.
I will keep troops in the field until the enemy is fully subjugated,
fully pacified.
There will be no compromise with the honor of our nation.
There will be no compromise with the honor of the United States Army.
Captain.
[Davis] As he had promised, General Miles sent troops forward without the Apache scouts.
General Miles sent troops forward without the Apache scouts.
For the next five months they relentlessly searched,
but the results were predictable.
Geronimo and his tiny band of Chiricahua
had vanished deep into the mountains of Mexico.
It seemed they were chasing a spirit more than a man.
[Miles] Lieutenant.
I doubt if you're enjoying your current assignment.
Nothing personal. I understand you're a fine officer.
Do you know why I called you here, Gatewood?
No, sir.
Tomorrow a new policy change will be announced.
As punishment for Geronimo's resistance,
all Chiricahua currently living on reservation land are to be rounded up and sent to Florida.
They will stay there until Geronimo is captured or killed.
That's a harsh penalty that he's drawn on his own people.
I hear you and Geronimo were friendly.
Any relationship I've had has never compromised
Any relationship I've had has never compromised my effectiveness in the field.
I need you to speak freely with me.
Can you find Geronimo? Talk to him?
I thought so once.
There's no way to be sure now.
The signs are that he's starving or close to it.
Living on cactus and rabbits.
I know this because I've got a net of observation points,
and 5,000 troops stretched from here to Sonora,
-searching for-- -Thirty-five Apaches, sir.
That's what I believe he'll be down to in a month's time.
Thirty-five starving Apache.
Beggin' the General's pardon, sir, but why not leave him to the Mexicans?
He can't continue to keep raidin' across the border.
He can't afford to lose any more warriors. He can't replace them.
The present political situation demands results.
I want you to find Geronimo and make him this proposal.
I have the authority to hunt this son of a bitch
all the way to South America if I have to,
but I want this nonsense to end.
Now I'm willing to give you all the scouts you need.
Hundred-man detail, regular cavalry, mule pack team.
A hundred men won't do.
How many do you want?
Three.
I'd like to pick them myself.
Whatever happens, Lieutenant,
this conversation that you and I are having never took place.
Any negotiations with Geronimo are to be strictly confidential. Is that understood?
are to be strictly confidential. Is that understood?
Two years in Florida?
Two years in Florida, with their families.
And when they return to reservation land here in Arizona territory,
every warrior gets 40 acres of land,
two mules.
I don't think you or the government intend to keep this promise.
You just offer it. None of the rest is your concern.
Do you know your scripture, sir?
"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world
and lose his soul?"
Lieutenant...
you have your orders.
[Davis] Lieutenant Gatewood chose the Apache scout, Chato, to accompany him,
as well as myself and Al Sieber, who had become bored with his retirement.
And after four weeks of attempting to track Geronimo
through the mountains of Sonora,
we came across a burning Indian village.
What we found there was unspeakable.
There's two dead women there.
Two little kids.
Scalped 'em all, all four of 'em.
Bounty hunters.
Government down here pays 200 pesos a head for the men, 100 for the women,
and 50 for those kids.
Kill any Indian, then claim they're Apache.
I don't see how any man can sink that low.
Must be Texans. Lowest form of white man there is.
[in Apache] Who are these people?
They are Yaqui, not Apache.
The dying Yaqui told me five White-Eye and a Comanche...
they attacked before dawn.
[in English] Most of the men got away.
They go up into the hills.
They come back one day, maybe two.
They come back for their families,
and build big fire and burn the bodies.
And they go join up with other Yaqui tribe.
Maybe find new wives.
They go off that way, into the hills.
After they hunt Yaqui men, they go to Soyapos...
get their money.
You and Sieber... I want you to track the bounty hunters that did this.
[in Apache] Geronimo is here.
You want me to ride? I'm ready...
You need more rest.
The women have gathered medicine.
Do we leave at dawn?
Don't worry.
We will not fight tomorrow.
Sleep.
[in Apache] I have just seen my power. An iron horse comes over the desert.
I have seen a vision. An iron horse for the Apache.
[Vaquero] Been down here...
almost 20 years.
I was in the war.
Confederate Officer.
After the hostilities ended,
I went to Texas.
Got in a little scrape with the law.
Come down here, got a new name.
New start.
Wife.
Family.
But in my heart...
Well, hell,
I'm still a Tennessee man.
My wife and her sisters,
they trade with Apache women.
They come down from the mountains.
They've done it for years.
A few days back, some Chiricahua showed up near here.
Where?
Straight up Montana Avviripe.
[in English] I didn't expect to see many Americans down here.
Where you fellas from? Texas.
I keep a house in Brewster County.
[Sieber] Awful far from home, ain't ya?
Well, we just came down here, try to make ourselves a livin'.
And what about you, friend?
It seems like you got a real curious nature.
You the law? Me? No, hell, no, no.
I'm just huntin' that son of a bitch Geronimo.
Thought you might've come across somethin' to help me out.
I'm sorry, amigo.
We ain't seen nothin'.
[Schoonover] Apache?
Why don't you sit down here while we have us a drink?
We'll take real good care of you.
Cover my back.
Anythin' happens, fire.
And keep firin'.
Sir.
That Apache is with us.
Don't look like it to me.
[Gatewood] He's a Sergeant of Scouts
in the United States Army.
Who the hell are you?
Charles Gatewood.
Lieutenant, 6th Cavalry.
[Schoonover] You boys are out of uniform.
Maybe he ought to wear one.
Somebody down here take that scalp of his.
Make themselves a little money.
Ten days ago, we came across a Yaqui village.
-All the Indians slaughtered. -[Schoonover] Hmm.
We come across the same type of thing a while back.
I tell ya, this is a crazy country.
$100...
buys that scalp back.
Nice doin' business with you, Mr. Gatewood.
But...
I changed my mind.
You rotten son of a bitch.
Amigo.
Move it, Dixie boy.
God damn.
I never thought I'd get killed tryin' to help save an Apache.
We got 'em, Mr. Sieber.
We got 'em all.
I've been gun-shot, arrow-shot 17 times.
Twenty years... chasin' old Geronimo.
Nothin' I'd love better than being there...
to finish.
You don't have to account yourself to me, Al.
You're a brave man.
I never did have no kind of luck.
Never did.
I'm gonna catch me a little sleep here...
for a minute or two.
[softly] Rotten sons of bitches.
Gatewood, no more burro!
Can't go higher!
[Gatewood] Chato and I...
are goin' on here alone.
You stay with the supplies.
Sir.
Are you giving me a choice?
That's an order, Lieutenant.
I know it's hard to come this far then stop... and I'm sorry.
Somebody's gotta go back and tell the truth.
Britton...
you're a fine officer.
You stay noble.
We're tryin' to make a country here.
It's hard.
[Mangas] Why did you bring him?
He is an enemy to his people.
He thinks you are.
He's a brave man to come here. Enough Chiricahua are dead.
[in Apache] They are dead because the White-Eye killed them.
[in English] Have they taught you to lie, Gatewood?
I don't lie.
But the truth is General Miles will hunt you for 50 years.
He's already sent your families to Florida,
which is far, far away.
Look around.
See how few warriors you have left.
If I kill White-Eyes forever,
I am still Geronimo, an Apache.
Who are you, Gatewood?
Just a man, like you,
and I wanna go home.
I wanna see my family.
My God.
My God is a God of peace.
A God of life and not death.
What does your God say?
Yosin is not here with us on the mountain.
Tell me, what is in your heart?
The war's over.
I offer this
because it has power for me.
Our fight must end here.
When I was young, I took a wife.
We lived in these mountains.
We have our family.
The Mexican soldiers came and they killed her.
They killed her and my two little girls.
They killed them because we are Apache.
I remember when I found their bodies.
I stood until much time had passed, not knowing what to do.
I had no weapon.
But I did not want to fight.
I did not pray.
I did not do anything.
I had no purpose left.
After a year had passed,
my power showed me how to get revenge.
And always since then, I get revenge.
But no matter how many I kill,
I could not bring back my family.
Yosin...
the Apache God is a God of peace.
I gave you the blue stone,
you give me this.
It will be peace.
[Davis] On September 4, 1886,
Geronimo and 34 Chiricahua men, women and children
surrendered to General Nelson Miles.
As he handed over his weapons, Geronimo simply said,
"Once I moved about like the wind, now I surrender. And that is all."
He refused any further conversation with the General.
After arranging Geronimo's final surrender,
Lieutenant Gatewood was immediately transferred
to a remote garrison in Northern Wyoming.
His continued presence would have been an embarrassing reminder
that the United States Army had failed to defeat a band of 35 Apache.
Instead of being rewarded with a medal for his heroic efforts,
Lieutenant Charles Gatewood was sentenced to obscurity.
[officer 1] Sir, formation is ready.
[officer 2] Attention!
[officer 3] Prepare to mount! [officer 2] Present arms!
[officer 3] Mount!
Detail, arms, halt!
"By order of the office of the President of the United States,
all Chiricahua scouts are under arrest
and will be transported to Fort Marion prison,
St. Augustine, Florida,
with the outlaw Apaches led by Goyakla -known as Geronimo." -[officer] Detail, halt!
"The Apache scouts from the White Mountain,
Coyotero, and Mescalero tribes are to return at once to their reservations.
are to return at once to their reservations.
They will remain within these boundaries unless given express permission to travel.
Their duties for the United States Army are at an end.
We thank them for their services."
[officer] Detail, collect arms!
I'm a good Apache. It's just not right.
I'm Sergeant Chato, a scout.
[Davis] Later that afternoon, Geronimo, his band of renegades,
and all the Chiricahua that had served the army so faithfully
were loaded into wagons and transported to the railhead at Holbrook.
There, they were to begin their journey to Florida and imprisonment.
Morning report, sir.
[Davis] Mr. Glenville, I'd like to see the General.
On what business?
[Davis] It's about Mr. Gatewood.
Sir.
I thought the U.S. Army kept its word.
I thought maybe we were the only ones left who did.
What's going on out there is a disgrace.
[Miles] Lieutenant,
you're more worried about keeping your word to a savage
than you are fulfilling your duties to the citizens of this country.
We won. That's what matters.
It's over, Lieutenant.
Geronimo, the Apache, the whole history of the west except being a farmer.
I don't think Mr. Gatewood would want me to be a part of any of this.
I hate an idealist.
There's always something messy about them.
I'm ashamed.
And you have my resignation.
[Davis] To the disappointment of family and friends,
I had ended my military career.
Over the years, the events surrounding the Geronimo campaign
have continued to haunt me.
I carry the memory of those days,
days of bravery and cruelty,
of heroism and deceit,
and I am still faced with an undeniable truth.
A way of life that endured a thousand years was gone.
This desert,
this land that we look out on,
would never be the same.
[in Apache] You were right to fight the White-Eye.
Everything they said to me was a lie.
You helped them...
I will hate you forever.
There are so few of us left...
we should not hate each other.
She has the coughing sickness.
She will die soon.
Maybe the baby, too.
No one knows why the One God
let the White-Eye take our land.
Why did there have to be so many of them?
Why did they have so many guns, so many horses?
For many years, the One God...
made me a warrior.
No gun, no bullets could ever kill me.
That was my power.
Now my time is over.
Now, maybe, the time of our people...
is over.
[Davis] Geronimo lived for another 22 years
as a prisoner of war.
Frank, thank God! I'm dead.
I'm dead.
Frank, I'm sorry. I got lost. This town is so confusing.
What a day. My wife had to work early.
My kid was crying when I took him to school. He hated to leave Chicago.
-It broke my heart, Frank. -Any more excuses?
-No. -Good. In the future be punctual.
-You got it? -I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
-Frank, how are you doing? -It's good to see you again.
-Hi, Marty. Sorry we're late. -Al, go help Jimmy and Raul.
Yeah, sure. This is his.
-You don't trust me? -I live in a crappy neighborhood.
-Have you got that funny money? -Yeah. Right here.
It looks good. It looks real good.
-We're in business. -Excellent.
There's just one problem. This guy Al....
He keeps asking all these questions about my counterfeiter.
My instinct usually tells me when something's wrong.
And there's something wrong. So I had him followed.
He's a Secret Service agent, Frank.
-What do you think I ought to do? -Be sure the body doesn't wash up.
I want you to pop him for me, okay?
-I think maybe you're with him. -You came to me, remember?
-So pop him. Show me I'm an asshole. -I'm just a businessman.
So pop him...
...and let's do some business.
Yes, Frank, that's what I'm looking for.
Come on, let's go get an omelet.
Let me get my pistol.
My gun?
You're under arrest.
You're under arrest, too. Secret Service.
You knew from the weight of the gun that it was empty, right?
There could have been one bullet there.
Hey, Frank.
Do you think we can go someplace and talk about this?
You killed guys before, Frank?
Does it get to you?
It gets to you.
I don't like this undercover stuff. I was so scared.
I joined the Secret Service...
...to protect people.
You like the idea of throwing yourself in front of a gun?
Hoping you get hit instead of the guy you're protecting?
I don't know. Maybe I'm....
-Maybe I'm just wrong for the job. -You're a good man, Al.
-You'll make a good agent. -How do you know?
I know things about people.
-Come on, let's eat. -I've got to go home to my family.
A lot of guys warned me you were a pain in the ass.
-I'll see you in the office. -Damn! The office.
-Monroe wants us to check this out. -I'll take care of it.
-I'll go with you. -No. Go hug your wife and kid.
I was not snooping, but the smoke alarm was going off.
I got scared.
I got more scared when I saw what was inside.
The smoke was from crumbs in the oven he left on.
Thirty-one years I've been in this country.
I love the United States. I've been to the White House.
Only in the United States can just anybody go to visit the President.
So when I saw this, these killing things...
...I called the police. They called the Secret Service.
That was two days ago.
The President gets 1,400 threats a year. We've got to check them all.
-You say his name's McCauley? -No, McCrawley, from Denver.
I remember it like yesterday. I cried and cried.
Joseph McCrawley, Denver.
Died over 30 years ago, age 11.
Your guy got a duplicate birth certificate...
...then used it to get a driver's license.
-Thanks, Jack. -See you.
Federal Agents. Open up!
Oh, my God! That's you.
-Yeah? -Frank Horrigan?
-Yeah? -The Secret Service agent?
-Yeah. What did I win? -My God, it's really you?
-Who the hell is this? -That was you in my apartment.
-McCrawley? -Why not call me Booth?
-Why not Oswald? -Booth had flair and panache.
The leap to the stage after he shot Lincoln.
-Where are you? -Closer than you'd imagine.
It's very exciting to talk to you. I feel like I know you.
I've read about you and seen photos. You were JFK's favorite agent.
But that was a long time ago. What keeps you going?
Let's get together and talk.
I think the less you know about me, the better.
-I'm planning to kill the President. -You shouldn't have said that.
Threatening the President is a federal offense, even if you don't mean it.
I mean it.
One need only be willing to trade one's own life for the President's.
-That's right. -I'm willing.
Going up against you raises the game to a much higher level.
Fate has brought us together, Frank.
-I just can't get over the irony. -What irony?
Your intimate involvement with the assassinations of two presidents.
Hang on a second. I've got something on the stove.
He was a tenant for three weeks.
What's really weird is the other tenants never really saw him.
Statements vary. He was between 5'8" and 6'2".
Between 165 and 180 pounds.
-Age? -Between 28 and 45.
Before an election, panic is what you've got on a good day.
-They're waiting for you. -Hey, Frank.
-Sam. -It's been a long time.
-I hear the new director isn't much fun. -I've been the director for two years.
Al D'Andrea. You know Matt Wilder.
He still owes me $20 from Super Bowl 21.
This is agent-in-charge Bill Watts and Lilly Raines.
-She's very pretty for a secretary. -And you're very old for an agent.
Lilly's an agent.
I just wanted to see if she had a sense of humor.
Have a seat. Let's talk about this guy.
I guess we're calling him Booth for now.
-What do you know about him? -He's dangerous.
-How do you know? -I know things about people.
Why didn't you take steps to know more that first night?
-We had a busy day. -Too busy to investigate properly?
-A 10-minute search of his room? -I didn't have a warrant.
-Given your reputation-- -What reputation is that?
-Let's get back on track. -What are you referring to?
Am I paranoid, or is he busting my balls?
Probably a little of both.
Bill, there was a time around here when I was almost as arrogant as you.
I don't have time for this. I've got to pull 75 agents out of Miami.
Keep me posted, Sam, will you?
-So what do we do with this guy? -We keep investigating.
-Tap my phone. -Will he call again?
-He'll call. He's got panache. -Panache?
-Yes, it means flamboyance. -I know what it means.
-Really? I had to look it up. -All right, we'll tap your phone.
By the way, Watts isn't nearly as arrogant as you were.
Just what reputation was Watts referring to, Sam?
You know.
Is it because I'm considered a borderline burn-out...
...with questionable social skills?
What do you want to talk to me about, besides your reputation?
I want to be assigned to the President.
Protection? After all these years? Frank, you're a dinosaur.
-This guy's gonna make a try. -Watts will fight me all the way.
You owe it to me.
-I've kept you in a job. -I've got to come back.
Do you really want to stand post again? At your age?
Yeah, I've got at least one pair of good shoes somewhere.
We're stopping. Traveler wants to work the ropes.
The French President's coming. Get a security man up here.
Damn it! Get back.
-What's going on here? -Horrigan had a heart attack.
-Hey, are you okay? -Get the hell out of here.
-What's going on? -I had a call about a cardiac case.
-Are you all right, Frank? -I'm on my break here.
I get it, you bastards.
Who's the wise guy?
Okay, everybody, back to work.
-All right, who was the joker? -It may not have been a joke.
-You were looking peaked today. -I'll pay him back in spades.
How can you be sure it was a him?
-You've missed my street, Al. -Why don't you have a car?
I lived in New York a long time. I like public transportation.
If you like buses, why make me go out of my way?
I like your company.
-He's a weird-looking guy. -If he still looks like that.
Pull up over here.
The President's election troubles were hardly apparent today.
He and the French President stopped twice to greet the crowds.
The Senate has yet to react to the new French trade agreement.
The French will host a formal dinner at their embassy for the President.
Presidential advisors are pleased...
...with the publicity this has brought in an election year.
It's a weird sub-culture, Al. Send some agents to check this out.
-Ask about some wackos. -I'll get on it in the morning.
Hang on, I've got the other line.
-Yeah? -Frank.
-Booth, how are you doing? -I'm fine, thanks.
Hang on, I'll get rid of the other call.
-You got it? -Yeah, keep him talking.
-Yeah? -Trying to trace me?
-Why didn't I think of that? -You did. You're a good adversary.
-But I was worried about you today. -Why?
In the motorcade, I thought you were going to pass out.
You should get in shape for that kind of duty.
-Yeah, maybe you're right. -I'm watching your movie.
-Movie? -November '63. Kennedy's last days.
The arrival in Texas.
It must have been exciting.
Dallas. That morning at Love Field.
You all look so radiant. JFK, Jackie and you.
You look so young and able, Frank.
What did happen to you that day?
The only agent to react to the shots was farther away than you.
You must have looked up at that window, but you didn't react.
Late at night when the demons come...
...do you see the rifle at the window, or Kennedy's head being blown apart?
If you'd reacted in time, could you have saved him?
If you had, that could've been your head being blown apart.
Do you wish you'd succeeded, or is life too precious?
What's done is done.
I have that Esquire article on the tenth anniversary...
...about you and the other agents.
So sad how your wife left you and took your little daughter.
You were so forthright about your drinking problem.
And that you weren't easy to live with.
I was so moved by your honesty.
The world can be a cruel place to an honest man.
What about you, Booth? What's your story?
It's an epic saga.
I'll talk to you again soon. It's nice to have a friend.
-Did you get him? -We got him.
He could have a device that makes it look like he's using another number.
look like he's using another number.
-This device, how could he get it? -He could build one.
-Can you trace it? -We could run a parity check.
-Can you trace the call? -Not if it's a para-analog line.
Give me a straight answer, or Al will shoot off his foot.
If he calls again, keep him on the line. We'll see what we can do.
You might suggest that the police don't knock down any more doors.
I have that Esquire article about you and the other agents.
about you and the other agents.
So sad how your wife left you and took your little daughter.
You were so forthright about your drinking problem.
And that you weren't easy to live with.
I was so moved by your honesty.
-Okay, but why play it for me? -Cancel the President's dinner.
The dinner at the French Embassy? This close to the election?
He manipulated the phone system.
He could have knowledge of explosives.
-Do your job. There'll be no problems. -There may be arms in the embassy.
You think the French want to knock off the President?
Why does every chief of staff--
You have no reason to think that this is anything but an idle threat.
You want me to cancel a state dinner and risk offending the French?
This guy's pushed your buttons and you're overreacting a little.
-I'm trying to protect your boss. -So am I.
We're trailing 12 points in the polls, and the election's in six weeks.
-He's got to be seen. -Even if it kills him?
How could being down 12 points look like good news?
The President was even worse off weeks ago.
He'll be out with the voters in the Midwest and then in California.
The President and First Lady of the United States.
His Excellency, the President of France and his wife.
Agent Raines, you look devastating tonight.
-Thank you. -Good enough to eat, I might add...
...if you'll pardon the expression.
I try to sympathize with you, but you really do annoy me.
Why sympathize?
The tape of that phone call. When he mentioned your wife.
-Ex-wife. -At any rate, I'm sorry.
Strange, I get sympathy from an assassin and a woman I annoy.
-Would you care to dance? -Perhaps some other time.
I get off in a couple of hours.
-What are you looking at? -Where do you hide your firearm?
Don't tell me, let me guess.
We're on our final approach to L.A. It's a beautiful day out there.
Thanks for flying with us. We hope to see you again.
-Deposit this in the new account. -I'll need to see your papers.
"Microspan Corporation." What kind of business are you in?
"Microspan Corporation." What kind of business are you in? -Software. -Up in San Jose?
-Software. -Up in San Jose?
I'm based there, but I'm opening an office in L.A.
You're not from San Jose? Where are you from?
-Minneapolis. -You're kidding! So am I.
Well, it's a small world.
I hated the winters. I used to stay in and pig out.
-What high school did you go to? -New Brighton High School.
-There isn't any New Brighton. -There was when I was there.
Well, maybe I'm just confused. It happens a lot.
-There was a school across from-- -I'm late, will this take long?
Not at all, just another minute.
Thank you.
-You have a very pleasant manner. -Thank you, Mr. Carney.
How would you like to give a colleague a ride home?
-Why do you keep flirting with me? -Am I?
-You know it can't go anywhere. -That's why I do it.
Come on, I'll buy you an ice cream. No further obligations.
Oh, boy.
-How many female agents are there? -About 125.
-Pure window dressing. -Excuse me?
Window dressing. 125 out of 2,000.
You're around so the President looks good to his feminist voters.
-Do make an effort to be obnoxious? -It's a gift.
We do a lot of window dressing. Like running with the limousine.
It'd take an anti-tank missile to put a dent in it.
But it makes the President look more presidential.
If I'm here for the feminist vote, what demographics do you represent?
Let's see.
White, piano-playing, heterosexuals over the age of 50.
There ain't a lot of us, but we do have a powerful lobby.
-Time flies when you're annoyed. -Where are you going?
-Time flies when you're annoyed. -Where are you going? -I have a date. -With whom?
That's none of your business.
-You want a ride? -I don't think so.
I like it here this time of day. I think I'll hang out.
Okay, thanks for the ice cream.
-See you. -You're welcome.
If she looks back, that means she's interested.
Come on now, give me that smug look and be on your way.
Well, Abe.... Damn, I wish I could've been there for you.
Hi, baby, how are you doing?
Yes, I missed you too.
I didn't mean to startle you. I got your address from the phone book.
-I'm not listed. -Well, I better come clean.
I followed you. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at this.
I'm new in town. I was wondering if you'd care to join me for dinner.
That's sweet, but....
I also wanted to apologize for lying to you about being from Minneapolis.
I shouldn't ask so many questions.
Did you mention our conversation to anyone at the bank?
-No! -May I?
Rory, settle down!
-Pam, what's going on? Oh, hi. -This is my roommate.
-Pam, what's going on? Oh, hi. -This is my roommate. -Sally, this is Mr. Carney. -Nice to meet you.
-Sally, this is Mr. Carney. -Nice to meet you.
-I was just on my way out. -I'm sorry, but you can't leave.
What?
You shouldn't have been from Minneapolis.
I don't know what you want, but....
-Hi, this is Sally. -This is Pam. We're not in right now.
-Leave your name and number. -And we'll call you back. Bye.
Frank, I hope you don't mind me calling you at the office.
-No, why don't you drop by? -I'd love to.
Let me take some time to welcome those who are joining us late.
I'd love to drop by. We've got so much in common.
We do? Like what?
We're both willing to trade our lives for the President's.
We were both betrayed by those we trusted.
-I wasn't betrayed, Booth. -Sure you were, Frank.
The Warren Commission reported your procedure as seriously deficient.
They criticized all the agents for being out drinking the night before.
As if Kennedy would be alive today if you'd been in bed by 10 p.m.
-Maybe they were right. -No, they weren't right.
You wanted to have agents stationed all around his car. He refused.
Do you know why? Because he had a death wish.
He talked all the time about being assassinated.
His favorite poem was "I Have a Rendezvous with Death"...
...which is not a good poem, Frank.
I think he wanted to die.
And I think he didn't care that
his death would ruin your life.
What do you think?
Frank?
-What about you? Who betrayed you? -I don't think he's scrambling it.
Some of the same people, but I'm going to get even.
I'll have my day in the sun. The question is, will you?
I think you're in for a lot more pain.
How much of this shit do I have to listen to?
He's across the street. LaFayette Park.
Booth!
I told you to get in shape, Frank.
Is this your current address?
And you didn't see anybody suspicious hanging around that phone booth?
That's him! Al, that's him!
Secret Service! I'm impounding this car. He put his hand on here.
-We got fingerprints. -Are you all right, Frank?
Hey Tony, have a look at this.
-The print from Secret Service? -Yeah, it's really strange.
This is C-12. We can't tell them.
Horrigan, I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.
-You're sure? -We ran it against everything.
I'm meeting with the President. You keep investigating.
-What should I do? -You'll think of something.
You're a real pain when things don't go your way.
Your friends warned you about that.
The President hit the campaign trail
today on a 6-day tour of 12 states.
With just a month to the election, he's trailing by 10 points.
He'll concentrate on the Midwest, where he's sagging in the polls.
The campaign will wind up in Chicago with a big rally.
Reservations.
Do you have a flight on Tuesday from Washington to L.A.?
I'd like an open-ended ticket so I can make some stops on my return.
C-5, off-load the choppers first. Who's our route agent?
That'll be Jacqueline King.
This is Watts, we have arrival at 13:15.
-Where are we keeping the cars? -Denver PD has an area for us.
This is Watts, we're ten minutes out.
Here in Denver we gather today in the shadow of giants.
Brave pioneers who overcame the wilderness and carved a new nation.
Today we are asked to match our vision to their vision.
And to pass that legacy on.
-Is sector three secure? -Sector three is secure.
The President was campaigning today in Denver.
We are living in a time of global economic transition.
We need compassion and vision to create a future...
...of peace and progress for everyone.
The President is due to arrive here in L.A. later in the month.
He'll compete for California's 54 electoral votes.
This is Sandy Riggs calling.
If you want to catch a rally in the Midwest, you'd best call me.
The President has no fixed schedule.
In answer to your other question, just send a check to party headquarters.
Ladies and gentlemen of Holly, Michigan... ...the President of the United States.
We've gone a long way toward achieving that goal....
We've got some trouble up ahead. Notify the White House staff.
Milwaukee will be easy tomorrow.
Flight 318 to Milwaukee is now boarding at Gate 21.
All passengers proceed to the boarding area now.
Checking.
Hey, pal, found any bombs today?
Did the First Lady ask about me?
Have you gotten to know them yet?
-I prefer not to get to know them. -Why is that?
They might not be worth taking a bullet for.
Here comes my replacement. Let's go to the bar.
-We can't drink on the road. -But they have a great piano player.
I've played for presidents and with presidents.
Nixon and I once did a duet of "Moonglow."
-I heard he didn't like you. -We got on all right.
His Chief of Staff didn't like me.
He once ordered me to get rid of some anti-war protesters.
I said I couldn't do that. Freedom of speech and such.
He said, "When I'm talking to you, I am the President."
He said, "When I'm talking to you, I am the President." I said, "You look like a sack of shit in a cheap suit to me, sir!"
-The "sir" was a classy touch. -I thought so.
You never wear shades when you're standing post.
I like the wackos to see the whites of my eyes.
A glare can be just as effective as a gun. Know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
You got me.
You'd better stick to the shades, sweetheart.
What are you afraid of?
I'm afraid of making a big mistake.
Good night.
Good, we've got some updates on Milwaukee.
Thanks.
-Don't answer it. -No. Oh, shit.
Raines.
Okay, I'll be right down.
Traveler's losing ground in Georgia. Milwaukee's out tomorrow.
And they're staging a rally somewhere outside Atlanta.
Damn!
What am I doing?
Oh, Lilly....
I've got to put all that shit back on, damn it!
I'm glad to see you all out here in the rain with me today.
I've been saying, "Don't just vote for me, join me."
And today you certainly have. We may get a tad damp today.
But guess who's gonna be all wet on Election Day?
How about the watch list?
Twenty-three crazies are under surveillance.
The hospital?
Extra units of Traveler's blood type are on hand.
Accessible to the alternate route too.
-Under the weather? -Sick as a dog, Lilly.
What's this? "Psychological Profile of John Booth."
-Did you make a mistake? -What?
You said you were afraid of making a big mistake.
With this job, let's be realistic. It's not like we work in a bank.
-You had an affair with an agent? -He wasn't an agent.
But he left you because you wouldn't quit your job?
I left him. I wouldn't quit my job for him.
It broke my heart.
You vowed never again to let a man come between you and your career.
But now you're in love with me and it scares you a little, doesn't it?
-Blow your nose. -Sorry.
What would happen if I gave up my job for you?
Why would you do that?
I vowed never again to let my career come between me and a woman.
Frank....
-Hey, be careful, will you? -Yeah?
This whole event's been advertised in advance. Just be alert.
Watts, it's Horrigan, it's a zoo here. We gotta take Traveler underground.
This is Watts. We are using the alternate arrival site. Underground.
-Watts, Booth may be here. -I thought you couldn't identify him.
-I can't. Just call it a hunch. -Ignore your psychic abilities.
All posts take to your positions.
-You've got a fever, Frank. -You stay alert in there, will you?
One quality above all marks this President.
It has earned him the respect of the people of this country.
That quality is courage.
The question is, will we stand
The question is, will we stand by the man who has stood by us?
-Stage right? -Stage right, all clear.
-Stage left? -Stage left, clear.
-Stage center? -Stage center, clear.
The President of the United States and the First Lady!
-Gun! -Get down!
What the hell's going on in there?
All clear.
-False alarm. -Traveler's secure. Resume positions.
-Are you hurt, Mr. President? -I'm all right.
Everything's all right, folks.
Everything's all right, folks. We had a little false alarm there.
That was exciting, wasn't it? Take your seat, please.
It was just a balloon popping. Traveler wants to continue.
Do you have any idea how many votes you cost us last night?
The President looked like a coward.
He looked all right. You were the one who looked like a coward.
-Is this just a joke to you? -No, you're a joke to me.
-You have no idea what we do. -That's enough!
I'll have you busting counterfeiters in Alaska!
Keep him away from the White House and away from me!
-The man's a disgrace. -You can't talk to him like that.
I don't work for him. You work for me. At least you did. You're off my detail.
You work for me. At least you did. You're off my detail.
My Super Bowl debt. In case I don't see you after this trip.
You know, Frank...
...if you just acknowledge that it was an unfortunate situation--
-I'm not going to apologize. -I'm not saying you should.
-But the President was humiliated. -He's alive.
-We are here to save his dignity too. -I'm not paid for that.
When Kennedy's girlfriend got into trouble, you said she was with you.
-That was just a rumor. -I heard the whole story.
You were suspended for a month in order to save his dignity.
-He was different. -Maybe you were different.
I was different. The whole country was different.
Everything would be different if I'd been half as paranoid as I am today.
Frank....
Why not just retire? Live off your pension. What's the point?
Somebody else asked me that not long ago.
You don't spend any money, except on jazz records.
I want to stay on the Booth case, Sam.
All right, but as for protective detail--
I understand.
That thing in Chicago....
I've never been on the wrong side of a judgment call like that.
You had the flu! That can impair your judgment.
Face it, Frank. You're too old for this shit.
Hello.
What happened in the Windy City, Frank?
Booth?
-Did the balloon get you panicky? -You were there.
-Did the balloon get you panicky? -You were there. Yes, yes.
I couldn't help wondering why you'd
I couldn't help wondering why you'd risk your life to save such a man.
You have such a strange job. I can't decide if it's heroic or absurd.
Why would you risk your life to kill a man like that?
-Read my psychological profile. -I don't believe in them.
Nor do I. A man's actions don't equal the sum of his psychological parts.
-It doesn't work that way. -Just how does it work?
It doesn't work. God doesn't punish the wicked and reward the righteous.
Everyone dies. Some die because they deserve to.
Others die because they come from Minneapolis. It's meaningless.
If none of this means anything, why kill the President?
-To punctuate the dreariness. -You need to get yourself laid.
You're the same. Name one thing in your life that has any meaning.
-I play the piano. -That's not enough.
How do you know? Do you play?
I've seen you in your bar alone.
There's no cause worth fighting for. All we have is the game.
-I'm on offense. You're on defense. -When do we start playing the game?
The clock's ticking, Frank. Take care.
The clock's ticking, Frank. Take care. Wait. Wait, Booth.
He scrambled it. I missed him.
Fuck!
Fucker.
Jesus, Frank.
I called for hours. I thought something happened to you.
I'm sick, I'm tired and I'm armed, too. So be careful.
-You're also maybe a genius. -Not to be recognized in this lifetime.
-Did you listen to the call? -Yeah, remember--?
Call the field office in Minneapolis.
See what you can find about accidental deaths.
Frank! Will you listen to me, please?
Frank! Will you listen to me, please? -Spit it out, damn it! -We spoke to some model builders.
-Spit it out, damn it! -We spoke to some model builders.
There is a professor at Pasadena College. I think we've got something.
I think we've got something.
I met him at a design conference in New Orleans a year ago.
We ordered a few rounds of drinks. He seemed like a nice enough guy.
But when we talked politics he got a nasty edge.
He said the government betrayed him and he was out for revenge.
The way he said it scared me.
I said, "Nice talking to you." And I got the hell out of there.
For the life of me I cannot remember his name.
But I'm pretty sure he said he was from Phoenix.
You ought to talk to a guy in Phoenix named Walter Wickland.
-We're going to Phoenix. -Let's get a police artist.
-Have a sketch faxed to us. -You figured that out by yourself?
-Kiss my ass, Frank. -I told you you'd make a good agent.
That doesn't look much like him, but it's got to be Mitch Leary.
-I haven't seen him in over a year. -What do you know about the guy?
You see this wheelchair? Mitch bought it for me.
You see this wheelchair? Mitch bought it for me. It cost over $1,000.
-You see this? -Take it easy now.
This is in case he ever comes back.
He accused me of ripping off his design.
He said my penalty for disloyalty was death.
If you put him away, I'll sleep better.
-Where can we find him? -I've got his address somewhere.
Don't move.
Drop it!
-Let him go, Horrigan. -I got him.
It's okay. We're on the same team.
-Hands, motherfucker! -I'm getting my identification!
-Give it to me. -David Coppinger. CIA.
-And who's this asshole? -He's with me.
-Goddamn it! -Are you here for Leary or me?
Mr. Leary used to be one of our operatives.
-He's threatened to kill the President. -We didn't think he was serious.
-But you knew. You and the FBI. -I understand your frustration.
You understand my frustration? You pompous son of a bitch!
What did Leary do for you? Run drugs? Sell arms to Iran?
It's a C-12 matter, so this is off the record.
If asked, I'm going to deny it.
-Leary's what we call a wet boy. -What's a wet boy, Frank?
Leary's an assassin.
Leary's an assassin. He's more like a predator.
He's more like a predator.
-Was that you shooting? -Yes.
-What kind of gun is that? -Something I made.
You made it? That beats paying for it.
-Can I see it? -Yeah.
-It's light. What's it made of? -It's composite. Like plastic.
Pretty neat! Mind if I give her a little dance?
-Not at all. -Go for it.
That is great! That is really great!
-Would you sell it? -No, I need it.
-For what? -To assassinate the President.
-Why would you want to do that for? -Why did you kill that bird, asshole?
Leary was one of our most effective contractors, but times changed.
Cutbacks had to be made. Leary didn't take it too well.
-We've not been able to locate him. -We can work together on this.
-Wouldn't that be refreshing? -We have fingerprints and photos.
-These are at least 15 years old. -He's camera-shy.
He'll be in disguise, anyway. We need photo alterations, Sam.
What I'm about to show you is highly classified.
This is a former colleague of Leary's. A close friend.
He went by Leary's home to try and get him to accept counseling.
This is how Leary treats his friends.
We need every possible variable.
We need every possible variable. Facial hair, glasses, weight change.
Keep in mind he's 15 years older now.
As good as they are, they aren't much good. The eyes are dead.
You can always tell a man by his eyes.
-Tomorrow morning I'd like you to-- -I'm resigning tomorrow.
What?
What for? Because you were scared down in Phoenix? I was scared too.
I have nightmares about that boat with the bag over my head.
I can't breathe. Phoenix clinched it.
-The service has counselors. -I've been to counselors.
-We can get this guy. -I can't do it!
Stop this cockamamie shit. Come on, pal, I need you.
Please.
Okay, Frank.
Cockamamie. That's a word your generation hasn't embraced yet.
You ought to use it once in a while to keep it alive.
-Cockamamie! -Yeah.
-Oh, God! -Well, it made you laugh.
-Oh, God! -Well, it made you laugh. You kill me, Frank.
Hello.
Hello, Frank. And let me welcome
Hello, Frank. And let me welcome all of you joining our program.
I know who you are, Leary.
I'm glad. Friends should be able to call each other by name.
-We're not friends. -Sure, we are.
I've seen what you do to friends.
-What's that supposed to mean? -You slit your friend's throat.
-You talked to Coppinger? -Yeah.
Did you de-louse? The man's a professional liar.
I saw the photos.
No, you saw what he wanted you to see.
I saw a picture of your friend with his throat cut.
What you don't know is that they sent my best friend...
What you don't know is that they sent my best friend... ...to my home to kill me!
...to my home to kill me!
-Your voice is shaking. -I haven't lied to you, Frank!
Everyone who ever knew you says you're sick.
-Your colleagues. Your wife. -What does your wife say about you?
Frank, I want you to understand.
We both used to think that this country was a very special place.
Do you have any idea what I've done for God and country?
Some horrible things!
I don't even remember who I was before they got their claws into me.
They made you into a real monster.
And now they want to destroy me.
What do you see when you're in the dark and the demons come?
I see you standing over the grave of another dead President.
-That's not gonna happen. -Fuck you, Frank.
I'm willing to trade my life for his and that's all it takes.
That President is coming home from California in a box.
-Where in California? -The address?
I'll keep you in the game, but I won't throw it for you.
-I want you to give yourself up. -To live a long and fruitful life?
Don't lie to me. I have a rendezvous with death.
So does the President. And so do you, if you get too close.
You have a rendezvous with my ass, motherfucker!
You know how easily I could kill you?
I've watched you go home.
You are alive because I have allowed you to live.
Show me some damn respect!
St. Francis Hotel!
Frank.
Take my hand, Frank.
Take it. If you don't, you'll die.
Take it.
You're gonna shoot me after I saved your life?
Shit.
The only way to save the President is to shoot me.
Are you willing to trade your life for his...
...or is life too precious?
Leary, don't move!
I got him!
Al?
There's nothing here.
Frank, you've got a phone call.
Yeah?
Frank, you looked so sad on the bus. I'm sorry, it was self-defense.
-Tell me about Skellum. -Skellum is worthless.
-Are you gonna meet him in L.A.? -You're way behind in the game.
I'm way ahead. I know what you look like. I've seen your eyes.
-They might look different next time. -Not what's behind them.
-You better pray I never find you. -You want to kill me, Frank?
That's right.
-The irony's so thick here. -There is no irony!
-The irony's so thick here. -There is no irony! The same government that trained me to kill, trained you to protect.
The same government that trained me to kill, trained you to protect.
Now you want to kill me. Up on that roof I protected you.
They'll write books about us.
-I'm tired of your bullshit! -Don't be a poor sport.
You could have taken me out, but you chose to save your ass.
It does make me wonder about Dallas.
Did you really do all you could, or did you make a choice there too?
Do you really have the guts to take a bullet?
I'll be thinking about that when I'm pissing on your grave.
There's no one named Skellum in all of Los Angeles?
-What about Louisiana? -Hang on.
No Skellums. Sorry.
Damn it!
-The election's in three weeks. -Just stay out of California.
If this guy's so smart, he's not gonna tell you where he'll do it.
I don't think he'd lie to me.
You've become that close?
California is the key to the whole race.
-We can't let up now. -We have to change our procedure.
Frisk people within 50 yards.
Frisk people within 50 yards. At $10,000 dinners?
-You're overreacting. -If I don't, the President's dead.
-Why is he even here? -He's heading this investigation.
Then let him investigate, but keep him out of sight.
If you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of a campaign.
-Frank. Hi. -Hi.
-Up late? -L.A. will be a lot of work.
-What's up? -I've got a request.
I'd like you to talk to Watts. Get me on your team.
-He thinks you'll overreact. -What do you think?
-You're too close to all this. -That's why I've got to be there.
-I can spot him. Anticipate him. -You think he'll be in California?
-Why would he tip you off? -He wants to keep the game close.
This has nothing to do with you and me. Strictly professional.
But that son of a bitch killed my partner. My friend.
I know. I'm sorry.
You're looking at a living legend.
The only active agent who ever lost a President.
Please.
Mr. Horrigan, welcome to Los Angeles.
Can the President close the gap in the little time he has left?
Today he's in California for a rally at the Bonaventure Hotel.
Field office, the advance team is at the Bonaventure.
-Any problems? -No.
We've swept the motorcade route.
Manholes are secured. Mailboxes removed. Abandoned vehicles towed.
We'll need sharpshooters on both those towers.
We need sharpshooters to cover those restricted areas.
Other polls today had the President three points behind.
He'll have to close that margin in California.
Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport.
-Raines, double-checking those exits? -Yes, this is the third time now.
Alert, section five.
Secret Service.
-Robert Stermer. -He's a bellboy. He's cleared.
-Robert, have a nice day. -No questions.
Come on, pack it up and move.
Mr. Carney, all set.
Finally we meet! You are James Carney?
-You must be Sandy Riggs. -So you really do exist.
-I'm very much human. -Let's go up to the bar.
-When does the President arrive? -Tomorrow, before dinner.
Here's an invitation. Don't lose it. The Secret Service is acting crazy.
You've got a great seat, just across from the President.
So what is Microspan Corporation all about?
I just came to meet the President. I won't bore you with business.
I don't blame you. I don't understand high-tech.
I can't wait to introduce you. Look at this beautiful view.
Yes, very pretty.
Give me the list of dinner guests. Who was the organizer?
Sanford Riggs of the California Victory Fund.
Call LAPD and make sure they have no uniforms missing.
-It's been taken care of. -Call the hospital about blood.
Your average American businessman who looks at product marketing...
...sees the length and width of it. The Japanese see the depth.
We plan the next fiscal quarter. They plan the next quarter century.
-Our people don't understand that. -Mr. Riggs, can I talk to you?
-Who's that? -Secret Service agent.
-Do you know all these people? -I sure do.
-How about these pictures here? -I went through all this yesterday.
I'll cooperate, but this is bordering on harassment.
I'm a harassing kind of guy.
No, no, no, no.
I'll be right back, Mr. Carney.
He did what anyone of us would.
He beat up a bellboy on television. I'd say he was overwrought.
We're all overwrought. Leary's out there someplace.
-You don't think he's a liability? -No.
Well, you're in the minority. I want him gone.
Well, you're in the minority. I want him gone. -Send him on to San Diego. -By whose order?
-Send him on to San Diego. -By whose order?
Traveler. Do you want to tell him or should I?
Miss Raines, somebody's approaching Traveler's suite.
-Hi. -Hi.
What are you doing up here?
What are you doing up here? Seeing what I could do.
Between the LAPD, the FBI and the rest of us...
...there are 229 people protecting Traveler tomorrow.
A lot of guns.
If Leary gets off a shot, we could be killed in the crossfire.
Frank.
-Bill Watts just called. -Heard about the bellman?
-Bill Watts just called. -Heard about the bellman? So did Traveler.
They want you to go to San Diego and assist in the advance.
Just like that.
It's not just you against Leary.
Have some faith in the rest of us.
You know something?
For years I've been listening to all these idiots... ...with their pet theories on Dallas.
...with their pet theories on Dallas.
It was the Cubans, or the CIA.
The white supremacists, or the mob.
Whether it was one weapon or whether it was five.
None of that meant too much to me.
But Leary....
He questioned whether I had the guts to take that fatal bullet.
God, that was a beautiful day.
The sun was out.
It had been raining all morning.
The first shot sounded like a firecracker.
I looked over and saw him. I could tell he was hit.
I don't know why I didn't react.
I should've reacted. I should've been running.
I just couldn't believe it.
If only I'd reacted, I could've taken that shot.
It would've been all right with me.
-What's the number in San Diego? -619 ukulele.
-Ukulele? -That's how I remember it.
You just push U-K-E-L-E-L-E.
-Ukulele? Isn't that U-K-U? -I don't know.
-Ukulele? Isn't that U-K-U? -I don't know. But the phone number is U-K-E-L-E-L-E.
U-K-E-L. Wait a second.
Jesus.
We have an arrival. Chopper standing by.
-Southwest Savings, may I help you? -Southwest?
-Yes. May I help you? Hello? -What's your address?
Taxi!
-Post check. Post 3? -In place.
-Post 6? -In place.
-Post 12? -In place.
Wait right here.
There's no Leary in our accounts.
Try to imagine him in disguise. A hat, wigs, that sort of thing.
-I haven't been here long. -Who was here before you?
-Pam Magnus. -Where can I find her?
She's dead. She was murdered.
-She was murdered. -They won't cancel.
-Then make the arrival underground. -They want a big show.
-Then make the arrival underground. -They want a big show. -We need proof. -How about a dead president?
-We need proof. -How about a dead president?
I'm pulling up all the accounts Pam made, but it'll take time.
Fax me the list as soon as you get them.
All agents in position.
-Please step back. -Empty your pockets.
Thank you.
You're from Texas, right?
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
I'm sorry?
Frank! Watts is gonna shit if he sees you!
-Have you got a fax for me? -Yeah, what is it? What's this about?
What the hell is going on, Frank?
James Carney.
Carney, James.
-Jesus. -Frank!
-What the hell is he doing here? -I don't know.
-Who gave you permission-- -He's here. His name is Carney.
-Who gave you permission-- -He's here. His name is Carney. -I want the seating chart. -Give him the chart.
-I want the seating chart. -Give him the chart.
Gun!
Stop! Put the gun down!
Get down!
Don't shoot!
Get him in the car!
Hold your fire!
Get out of his way!
He's got a hostage!
Raines to shooters. If you have a shot, take it.
Nice view.
-What's the plan, captain? -It's your man. You tell me.
Get me sharpshooters on the north and west towers.
Take the subject out.
You had the guts. You took the bullet.
-I broke my damn ribs. -Sorry, I wasn't aiming at you.
Where the hell are the shooters?
-West tower in place. No lights. -No shot from the north.
A bullet-proof vest is a bit of a cheat.
-Otherwise, you played a good game. -It's no game, Leary.
I was doing my job. What do we do now?
Do you believe in the nobility of suicide?
No.
But if you want to blow your head off, be my guest.
Nicely put, but I don't want to leave this world alone.
-West tower, do you have a shot? -Negative, too dark. Target unclear.
-It's better to die with a friend. -Friend? You're a damn killer!
I saved your life. You owe me.
-I don't owe you shit. -I was always honest with you.
-Go ahead and shoot. -It's Frank. Quiet!
-Come on. -Are you talking to me?
-What are you waiting for? -Waiting for?
I'm waiting for some gratitude.
Without me, you're a sad-eyed, piano-playing drunk.
I brought you into this game. I let you keep up with me.
-I made you a hero today. -You didn't make me anything.
I redeemed your pathetic life.
I just did my job. You're the one with a pathetic life.
-Go ahead and shoot! -If they fire you'll be hit.
-I want you to thank me first. -Shut up and shoot.
All right, Frank.
-All right, Frank. -Stand by to fire on my command.
-Sleep well, my friend. -Just one thing, aim high.
-What? -Aim high!
-Now! -You bastard!
Take my hand. If you don't, you'll die.
You want to save me, Frank?
You want to save me, Frank? To be honest, no. But it's my job.
To be honest, no. But it's my job.
Take it.
Are you okay?
We've worked with Agent Horrigan for some time.
He exemplifies courage and self-sacrifice. Frank!
I guess I overreacted again, Harry.
Agent Horrigan, why are you retiring from the Secret Service?
Well, I hate desk work and I'm too old for running around.
And thanks to all this press, I'm no good for undercover work.
How are you, Frank? The President sent his limo for you.
-That's the least he could do. -Good. I love public transportation.
Come on in.
Make yourself at home.
-So, what do you think? -I like it.
Hello, Frank. By the time you hear this, it'll be over.
The President is most likely dead and so am I.
Frank, did you kill me? Who won our game?
Not that it matters.
Among friends, like you and me, it's how you play the game.
The game's done.
It's time to get on with your life.
I worry that you have no life to get on with.
You're a good man.
You're a good man. Good men, like you and me, are destined to travel a lonely road.
Goodbye and good luck.
I bet you that brown pigeon flies off before the white one.
He was a very decent guy, as was his partner, Bo.
He was a good listener.
He loved kids.
He had patience and common sense.
He was resourceful.
Come on, let's go. Watch your step. Come on, keep it moving.
Okay, people, let's go. Let's go. Come on, let me get through.
Let me get through now. Make way, come on. Step lively now, come on.
He was just a good cop.
Charlie lived happily in Queens, where he was born and had lived all of his life.
-Yo, Charlie. -Jesu. How are you?
-Kill anybody today? -Didn't even wound anybody.
Been really slow.
You're not gonna see your wife?
No, she doesn't like me to surprise her at work.
Charlie was married to Muriel. She hated Queens.
I don't know. If he was a detective or an undercover cop...
...at least he'd have decent clothes.
You know? But that's not for him. He's gotta wear the uniform.
I feel for you, honey. Because you got driving ambition.
I know. I never pushed him enough.
I know. I never pushed him enough. If he was on the take, at least I'd say, "Okay. He has initiative."
My sister was married to a cop for 10 years. It's a no-win situation.
Either they're honest and you're broke...
...or they're crooks and they never come home.
So your sister, what did she do?
She left the cop and married an electrician. That's your real money.
I'm running out of patience. I tell you, I'm a person who needs money.
And then there was Yvonne, a waitress, who's about to get some terrible news.
Miss Biasi, according to your records here, you owe $12,000 on your MasterCard.
Your Honor, those charges were incurred by my ex-husband...
...Eddie Biasi, the actor, after I threw him out.
The bank is not aware of your divorce.
Because we're not divorced yet. But I told him, "You have to tear up the credit cards."
But I told him, "You have to tear up the credit cards." And he promised--
If you're not divorced yet... ...you're still liable for any and all debts your husband has incurred.
...you're still liable for any and all debts your husband has incurred.
But I am divorced in my heart. You know? I mean, and that's what counts.
Legally, that's not what counts.
But do you know how much it costs to get divorced?
Have you ever been divorced?
Probably not. Probably not. Probably you haven't.
Probably you've had good luck your entire life.
Which is great. Which is the opposite of me.
Miss Biasi, if the MasterCard is in your name...
...it's still your responsibility.
Listen, please. I came to New York from Pittsburgh five years ago, to be an actress.
I had done "Our Town" in college.
Let me tell you something. Played Emily. People were crying buckets.
-I'm sure they were. -Will there be anything else?
So I come to New York, and I meet Eddie.
Talk about the worst luck of all. Your Honor, he swept me off my feet.
He bought me flowers, he took me on taxi rides, and real restaurants.
With linen and wine and good lighting, you know?
Everything was so perfect, except he turned out to be this pathological liar.
And I believed every word he said...
...because I used to have all this faith in people. You know?
So.... So, like, in short...
...what are my options here?
Charlie, Muriel and Yvonne all lived in a city...
...where people prayed for miracles every day.
Like winning the $64 million lottery.
My name is Angel.
The story you're about to see, well, it's pretty much all true.
I had a dream last night.
I was playing a slot machine, and I got three cherries, but they wasn't cherries.
They were my father's face, the face of my dead father. It's a sign.
But you hated your father.
Makes no difference I hated him. A sign is a sign.
I know you think I'm nuts, but I tell you, we're gonna win.
I didn't say you were nuts.
I just said the odds of us winning the lottery are not overwhelming.
And you know what? It's okay.
One bedroom in Queens is not my idea of living.
One bedroom in Queens is fine.
If we had kids.... If we had kids, it would be another story.
We don't have the money to have kids. Of course we have the money to have kids.
Cops have kids. Firemen have kids.
If only rich people had kids, there wouldn't be public schools.
Charlie, just get the ticket this morning, please.
She gotta get real. You gotta tell her:
"I'm the man. I'm out here every day, getting it done...
...getting paid, bringing it home." You know what I'm saying? She gotta listen to you.
-You can't be serious. -It takes two minutes.
I'm starving, man.
-Hey, this is police business, step aside. -Bo, Bo.
-It'll take two minutes. -Sorry. Sorry.
This is gonna take forever. Then the Burger King's another five blocks.
So we'll eat across the street. We never went there.
What, that place? Oh, no.
-Where the hell were you? -I told you yesterday, Sal.
Five times. A personal matter, I couldn't help it. Hi, Carol.
You are two hours late. It comes off your paycheck.
What? Do you know how many sick days I have coming?
You want a sick day, get sick. If you're healthy, you work.
Get me some coffee.
-On your head, sweetie pie. -Thanks.
-That guy sets a nice tone here, huh? -Yeah, like a drill sergeant.
Here we go.
-You guys want some coffee? -Please.
Please.
-You guys know what you want? -Cheeseburger deluxe, medium.
And while I'm waiting, a blueberry muffin.
All right.
And you, officer?
You recommend the lobster thermidor?
That's really funny. I mean, I think I'm just gonna die laughing.
The kind of day I've had so far. I can't even tell you what a treat this is.
You've had a bad day?
-Call me when you're ready. -A meatball sandwich.
Really. That's what I want.
-Meatball? -Meatball.
You are very brave, officer.
She likes you. Yeah, she really likes you.
I was trying to cheer her up.
We got a store alarm on Spring Street and a naked man in traffic...
-Well, I'm full. -...on Sullivan.
Shit, I'm gonna starve to death.
-Your turn for the check. -Okay.
Miss, we gotta run, so we'll just take a check.
After that whole routine?
-When those radios go off.... -Where, where? Where did I--?
Thank you.
All right, so that's two coffees plus taxes. Two even.
Oh, jeez. I'm short.
-Fine, officer. No charge. -No, I have the check.
I just don't have enough for a tip.
-I'll live. -I can't not leave a tip.
So leave a tip.
A lottery ticket?
With my luck? Be serious. Go, get the cat out of the tree or whatever it is that you do.
No, that would be the Fire Department.
-Come on, Charlie, let's go. -In a second.
Listen, I got an idea. What's your name?
Yvonne? Yvonne, I'm Charlie Lang, and we're partners.
If this ticket wins, I'll come back tomorrow and split the proceeds.
If it doesn't, I'll still come back and leave you a tip. What do you think?
-I think I'm never gonna see you again. -You'll see me tomorrow.
-Well, I'll be here. -You've got a deal.
All right, five more minutes.
-Charlie. -Yeah.
I ordered Chinese. Come up.
-In a minute. -What, are you whipped?
No, I'm not whipped. I've got adult responsibilities. Next batter.
Hey, batter, batter, batter.
That's it. I'm out of here. Where's the ball?
I'm coming, Mom.
-Are you whipped, Jesu? -It's my mother, there's no comparison.
-See you tomorrow, kiddo. -Yeah. Night, Charlie.
Did you, by any chance, have surgery last night?
You mean these? No. No, this is just a prosthetic bra....
Charlie, come on. Don't do that next to me. That's disgusting.
-I'm just soaking my feet. -Please.
I just can't believe it's you.
Well, it's not. But it's gonna be.
-Since when did this bother you? -Since now, okay?
Oh, God! Charlie, now you're spilling water all over the place.
Maybe I should call the Red Cross. I'll tell them we're a federal disaster area.
As a matter of fact, I have some a couple of sizes larger...
...that I'll change into after work.
-Charlie. -What?
You think I should get my boobs done?
-Done? -Yeah, you know, enlarged.
So I could be like that.
What, are you nuts? It seems so extreme.
-Forget it. -I just don't think you need it.
Forget it.
Look, the problem is that I had to declare bankruptcy. My MasterCard got taken away.
What I wanna know is when I'm gonna be able to get it back.
What are my chances?
-Under 15,000 a year? MasterCard. -Shall I speak to them? Love to.
Yeah? Well....
Wait. I see.
Well, thank you. That's what I thought.
-What did they say? -Slim to none. Those are my chances.
Well, the lotto jackpot has grown to over $64 million.
We'll check the winning numbers when we return.
-You got the numbers wrong. -Wrong?
Our anniversary is on the 27th, not on the 26th.
We always celebrate on the 26th.
We got the license on the 26th. We got married on the 27th.
-So why do we go out on the 26th? -I don't know, maybe it's custom.
Look, the fact is that I specifically told you our anniversary.
To anybody with any sense in their heads, that means the day they got married.
-I am sorry, darling. -Twenty-six, 64, 84.
Did he say 26?
Those numbers, again, are...
...6, 12, 16, 26, 64, 84.
-What? -We won. We got the jackpot.
-That's unbelievable. -We're rich. We're rich. We're rich.
-The jackpot? -We're rich, rich, rich.
-What are we having, honey? -BLT down with turkey bacon.
-Any Miracle Whip? -Of course I have Miracle Whip.
No matter how broke I am, there's just certain things, certain standards.
You have to have things in your life that are stable, that are permanent, eternal.
-Oreos. Smuckers. -Exactly.
-Thank you. -Will there be anything else?
Will there be anything else?
There'll never be anything else.
God, I hate this. I feel bankrupt.
What?
Oh, God. A bowling team from Albany had the same numbers.
-They get 9 million. -Why am I not surprised?
Well, how many are there on the team?
I don't know. Twelve guys is the average league.
Okay. Do each of these guys get a piece, or do you consider them all as one?
Muriel, Muriel. The veins, they're bulging out of your neck.
You look like a psycho.
What? All right. Yeah.
Oh, my God. Okay, the bowlers, thank God, they only count as one.
But that's 16 people that picked these numbers. Oh, God.
That only leaves us with...
...four million.
We could live on that, right?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
We could live on less, even.
Let's just pray that nobody else calls in, so we don't have to split it with them.
What?
What?
What, Charlie? You're making me nervous. What?
Honey...
...I've got something to tell you.
-A complete stranger? Charlie. -I owed her a tip.
A tip? Two million dollars? Come on.
I never thought we'd win, darling. I never thought we'd win.
But we did win, just like I told you we were going to.
But if we'd used your numbers, we wouldn't have won.
Don't do that. Don't do that, Charlie. Because you know and I know...
...that in my dream, my dead father came to me through the slot machine.
And in his eyes there were dollar signs and a "4" in place of the pupil.
Come on, Charlie. You wanna blemish his sacred memory?
That's ridiculous. He was a nut job, your father, he prayed to chickens.
He wants us to have the 4 million.
My God, do you think if he intended us to have half...
...wouldn't there be a "2" instead of a "4" inside the eyeballs?
It's not the right thing.
The right thing? Charlie, what the hell is that?
You've been doing the right thing your whole entire life for everybody else.
Just this once, please, do the right thing for us.
I gave her my word.
Charlie....
-Honey, do you love me? -Of course I love you.
Then stiff her. Stiff her and smell the flowers. For me.
-What would you do? -I'd buy the Knicks.
I mean, about the girl.
I'd take her to the Garden so she could watch me play.
I'd start myself as a very small, round forward.
So you agree with Muriel, right? Giving her half is crazy?
If I can't have the Knicks, I want those season tickets...
...where you sit on the floor with Jack Nicholson and Spike Lee.
And the waiters bring you food.
-A promise is a promise. -And one of those stereo systems...
...that you can hear in every room in your house.
You see, that way you don't have to be carrying around that boom box with you.
I could tell her I just won 5,000. I could do that.
Yeah, yeah, you could.
So, what's that? Season tickets, stereo system, Mazda GL6?
I couldn't do that. I couldn't just lie like that.
A boat. I've never even been in a boat.
Come on, are you listening to me?
I know you, man. You'll do the appropriate thing.
-Which is? -I don't know. That's your field.
Okay. So we have tuna on whole wheat... ...one scrambled soft, toast crisp, tea with lemon.
-Sugar's at your table. -Thanks.
-Everything okay here? Good, good. -Yeah, thanks.
Morning.
-You're back. -I said I'd be back.
-Coffee? -No, thanks. Actually, I just wanted to--
I really wanna apologize for yesterday. I was so rude.
It's just that it was pretty much the worst day of my life, from start to finish.
-Yvonne, let's go, wake up. -Impossible today.
-I'm impossible? Yvonne's dreaming here. -Quit the socializing.
Don't go anywhere, I want to apologize to you in detail.
Okay. Western for you, Walter.
And for Timothy, some nice oatmeal like Mom used to make.
My mother never made oatmeal in her life. My mother never made food in her life.
Bloody Marys, she made. White Russians....
-But she had a great personality. -So did Imelda Marcos.
-Well, she produced a nice son, right? -You're okay, you know that?
Eat.
He's got it, huh? Yeah, a couple of years. Come in twice a week.
Yeah, a couple of years. Come in twice a week.
He's really starting to go downhill, though, you know? In and out of the hospital....
What a world, huh? Really.
Makes you wanna appreciate every moment, not be petty or spiteful.
-I know just what you mean. -Yvonne.
Speaking of which....
What I have here is a check for $9.53. What I do not have is the $9.53.
He went to get his wallet out of the car. He said--
Never let them out the door.
-What am I running here, a soup kitchen? -I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
You sure did, gorgeous. And the $9.53...
...it gets deducted from your check. Bring me some coffee.
Let me.
Enjoy.
-Now, that's coffee. -So, what'll it be?
-They're actually.... They're right.... -Amazing, but true.
We are all out of cantaloupe, and the grapefruit's all dried out, so....
No, I'm not hungry.
The thing is, I got something for you.
-For me? -It's just, you know, a trifle.
May I?
It's one of those little strings that you connect to your glasses...
...so that they hang around your neck.
And that way you'll know where they are. At all times.
This is the nicest thing anyone's ever gotten me.
-I certainly hope not. -It's close.
You sure that I can't get you anything? Like a coffee or tea?
Decaf, please. I've reached my target heart rate for the day.
Decaf it is.
-So, you've had bad luck? -Unbelievable.
When I was 11, my dog died of parvo.
I still don't even know, to this day, what parvo is.
I married the wrong man. I mean the wrong, by a lot, man.
You know?
Now I can't afford to get divorced. I mean, except for yesterday....
Now I can't afford to get divorced. I mean, except for yesterday.... You know, I'm used to my luck.
But yesterday, I actually went bankrupt before I came into work, which was....
That's why I was so rude to you.
-You went bankrupt? -Yep.
-Look. From the officer. -That's sweet, honey.
-Wait. -What?
About our little agreement.
Double the tip, or half of what I won in the lottery.
-That agreement. -How about we make it your choice.
Door one, double the tip. Door two, half of what I won in the lottery.
My choice? Okay.
Whatever. I'll take door number two. I'll take half of the lottery. Pay up.
-You're sure? -Positive.
I was hoping you'd say that. I'll bet you were. Better luck next time, right?
I'll bet you were. Better luck next time, right?
Actually, we were.... We were pretty lucky.
-Really? Did you win something? -We won something.
All right. We won something? What did we win?
Four million dollars.
-Why are you doing this? -What?
This sick joke.
-No, it's not a joke. -This is not a joke?
-No. -No? What you're telling me....
What you're saying to me.... You really....
-What, you think I'd make this up? -Yes, yes, I do.
I'm not. We won.
The lottery? The New York State--? The "lottery" lottery?
The actual New York State lottery? Four million dollars?
Yes, 4 million is our share.
It happened last night. It would've been more... ...except a bowling team from Albany called in...
...except a bowling team from Albany called in... ...they took about 9 million out of the pot, but we won.
And you're telling me that you're actually going to split it with me?
A promise is a promise.
Oh, my God.
-You all right? -Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
I can't believe it.
Now I know why all these bad things happened. I know why now.
It's so this stupendous, phenomenal...
...unbelievably great thing could happen to me.
Because I had such bad, horrible luck before, no one would even mind.
Who wants ice cream on their pie?
-I do! -Who wants pie?
Thank you.
Wait a minute. I can't accept this, can I? I mean....
I can't accept this. I mean, I want to, so desperately I want to, but.... But there's this part of me, this neurotic part of me--
But there's this part of me, this neurotic part of me--
Accept it.
-How can I? -Accept it. I want you to have it.
-With all my heart. -Yvonne, take it.
Muriel, $2 million is still an enormous amount of money.
You should be committed to an insane asylum for the rest of your natural life.
They should put you in a straitjacket and take you to the loony bin...
...on Staten Island that Geraldo Rivera is always exposing.
Now, look, sweetheart, you weren't there. Okay?
This girl, she's got customers with AIDS, and she treats them like an angel.
-She's got a boss from hell. -Why did you stop at half?
Why didn't you just give her all the money?
-Would you get off my foot? -Look, we're doing the right thing.
You know what? The whole city will admire you.
Everybody will know you. You'll be a celebrity.
Well, maybe I could get some commercial endorsements out of this.
Absolutely. "Muriel Lang, the woman with the heart of gold."
You can endorse shampoos, conditioners...
...nail polish, nail polish remover.
"Muriel Lang, the woman with the heart of gold."
Well, I'd better get something out of this.
-Bowling for dollars. Bowling for dollars. -I want my check, Harry.
I want my check.
Some of New York's luckiest people gathered here in midtown Manhattan...
..here to stake their claim in the state's $64 million lotto jackpot.
So you promised Miss Biasi if your ticket came in, you'd split it?
That's right. As a tip.
As a tip? Hey. We got a cop that gave a waitress a $2 million tip.
We're gonna open our own bowling alley. -You insulted the guy. -I insulted the guy? Next time, you talk.
-You insulted the guy. -I insulted the guy? Next time, you talk.
-I'd like a little cottage in the country. -Excuse me.
-Excuse me. Excuse me. -Mrs. Lang, how do you feel?
-I'm Mrs. Lang. -Mrs. Lang? You're Mrs. Lang.
Oh, my God. Here. These are for you.
What an incredible woman you are to give $2 million...
-...to someone you don't even know. -You have no idea.
Mrs. Lang, do you have any trouble with the fact your husband...
...split $4 million with a stranger?
Not at all. In the beauty parlor that I work, I've always been known as...
...Muriel Lang, the woman with the heart of gold.
And if there are any sponsors out there, like Denorex...
...which I personally use, you know, because the air in my--
Guys!
We've got to get the winners together for a group picture.
Miss Biasi, what are you gonna do with the money?
A new car? Bigger apartment?
I haven't thought about it yet. It's so unexpected, you know?
Well, a promise is a promise.
Muriel Lang, woman with the heart of gold.
Oh, actress briefly, but it didn't work out.
Denorex. Works out each individual dandruff.
-Officer Lang, you gonna stay on the force? -I'm gonna buy the force.
-Yvonne? -So it's "Yvonne" already?
Is this the biggest tip you've ever received?
Definitely. Muriel.
-Have you ever won anything before? -Never.
-Never. -Big smile, everybody.
Come on, she has no taste. That outfit, it looked like it came from the '60s.
I thought she looked just fine.
She's not flashy. She's just a waitress.
Beauty is my business, defer to my judgment, okay?
My God, it's Bendel's. Honey, what a feeling it is to come here with money.
God bless you.
God bless you. Would you stop giving it away to every bum on the street.
Would you stop giving it away to every bum on the street.
God bless you.
-Now I'm happy. -I'm glad, sweetheart.
-Now I'm at peace with myself. -I'm glad, sweetheart.
Just a quick stop at Tiffany's, and I'll be born again.
Fur's for animals, not for people.
Excuse me.
This is Eleanor Smith of MasterCard credit services. We're calling with the happy news that you are now eligible...
We're calling with the happy news that you are now eligible...
...Miss Yvonne Biasi, for a $20,000 line of credit.
Please call me at 1-800-555-2000.
-I've died and gone to heaven. -Hi, Yvonne, congratulations on winning.
My name is Paul, and I'd like you to spank my tushy with a wire brush.
Oh, my God. That's disgusting.
I've got to change my number.
Hello, this is Yvonne. At the beep, please leave a message.
Hello? Sweetheart?
I'll bet you're there.
I know, I know. You're mad at me because I emptied the checking account.
I know, I know. You're mad at me because I emptied the checking account. -But, baby, I can explain. -Stay out of my life, Eddie.
You are there. Hi, baby.
The only reason you're calling is you read about me and the lottery.
-You want a piece of it. -What? You won something?
-Die. -No, baby. I'm serious.
I've been out of town. What, the lottery, you said? That's fabulous.
You did good?
I did all right.
Well, that's great, baby. Nobody deserves it more. I mean that.
From the bottom of my heart.
-Hello? -Please don't ever call me again.
-So when are you retiring? -I'm not retiring.
-Yeah, right. -I'm not retiring. Get off my case.
Where's that sense of humor?
What would you do? Three in the morning, a guy calls...
...says he's holding a Luger to his head...
...unless you give him $1,000 he's pulling the trigger.
If he called me at 3:00 in the morning, I'd tell him to go ahead.
-That really happen? -Last night. This lottery thing....
From one day to the next, you become this other person.
-It's just weird. -I feel bad for you, baby.
I'm not badmouthing it, all right? I'm just saying, it's an adjustment.
Sun. How are things in the mysterious East?
-Very good. Very busy. -No unjustified price increases?
No, no, no. Never.
Good. Two coffees, one regular, one light.
-How's the wife? -She has the flu.
I'm sorry to hear that.
On the house.
-Thank you. -Thank you. That's very sweet of you.
Down there, make a right.
Our favorite Korean is getting robbed right now.
You serious?
First he tells me his wife has the flu.
Oh, man, that bitch would work if she was dead.
Then he gives me coffee for free.
Shit. He is getting robbed. How do we play it?
Stay out front so they can see you. I'll go through the basement.
-Don't be a hero. -Don't worry. Call for some back-up.
Faster.
Faster!
-Nobody moves. -Come on!
A carton of Virginia Slims.
That cop's just sitting out there.
Don't worry about the cop.
What was that?
Come here. Watch him.
Come on, let's go. Come on, pal. Move.
-What's back through there? -Nothing. No entrance.
-What about that door? -Empty. Basement. Just rats.
-Rats? -Big ones.
I hate rats. Don't you keep this place clean?
Nobody move. Nobody!
What's with this cop?
He's got nothing better to do than write tickets?
With all the crime in this city?
-What do we do? -Wait till he leaves.
-What if he doesn't leave, then what? -He'll leave. Just shut up.
-What's the matter with her? -I think she's having a heart attack.
-Shut up. -Call a doctor.
I'm the doctor here, honey.
Shit.
Come on. Get up, Charlie. Get up, man. You all right?
Get inside, inside, there's another one inside.
Get in. There's another one inside.
Come on, Charlie, get up, man. You all right, man?
-Why didn't you just shoot this asshole? -Too many customers.
-You all right, man? -Yeah, I'm great.
Oh, man, you got shot.
His heroism saved lives and prevented injuries, though not to himself.
And certainly not to the criminals he stopped.
So I give to Officer Charles Lang this citation for bravery...
...and wish him a quick recovery. Officer.
Thank you very much.
I guess this bullet was fate telling me to take it easy for a while.
At least, that's what my wife says.
I love being a cop, lottery or no lottery.
I think it's the most important job in the world.
So I'd like to announce that I'll be donating $10,000...
...to the Policemen's Widows' Fund.
Thanks a lot.
Charlie, you're too young to be hanging around here like an old man.
Hey, I'm injured. Don't you read the papers? Hero cop?
If you're such a hero, play ball with one hand.
If I could, I would.
-See you. -Yeah, see you later.
-Good afternoon, sir. -Good afternoon.
-This looks like Beirut. -Isn't it great?
Oh, honey.
The building's going co-op next year, then we'll have a six-room apartment to sell.
-Mr. Patel told me. -Who?
Mr. Patel. Hi, I'm your accountant. Hello, pleased to meet you.
By the way, all the very best on your new fortune.
Thank you.
He says that we can make $100,000, pure profit, on this apartment.
Minimum.
And then we'll beat the state and city taxes if we move to Jersey within the year.
But I don't wanna live in Jersey. I wanna stay here.
And do what? Play stickball?
It's the architect. Excuse me.
-Where's my chair? -I gave it to Goodwill.
But you know I love that chair. You could have asked me.
Why should I? You're the one that loves to give everything away.
Women. Who can live with them? And without them?
What?
-Gray's Antiques had another break-in. -Again?
Yeah. Two brothers walked off with a Biedermeier chest.
Then Gray says to me, "How could some black guys know how much this is worth?"
-Oh, come on. He said that? -Yeah. To me.
What did you say?
I said, "I guess they subscribe to the African-American Antiques Newsletter."
He pissed me off.
-I miss you, man. -I'm going out of my mind.
This is like hell.
My house is a wreck, and I got nothing to do....
Well, that's retirement.
-Well. "Yvonne's." -She bought it a couple of weeks ago.
Good for her.
-Can I get you anything else? -Tea, please.
Okay.
-Eight wants tea. -Okay.
-How's the soup? -Not enough basil.
You're kidding me. I'll see what I can do.
-Go in. Say hello. -Forget it, she's busy.
Come on, man. I know you're dying to go in there.
No, I've got to get home. By the way, I got you something.
-Season tickets to the Knicks. -Oh, shit!
-They're not on the floor-- -Knicks tickets, man? For me?
You gotta be really somebody to get them on the floor.
Don't worry about that, give me some.
-I gotta go home. -Knicks tickets.
-Man, oh, man. Seat 7. -I'm glad she's doing well.
I don't know why you had to bring this coat. It's a warm night.
Maybe I'll get a chill later. Just hold it.
-There certainly are a lot of people here. -Isn't it great?
I feel like we're at the Academy Awards.
-Thank you. -I'm going to go circulate.
Okay, sweetheart.
-Here's your lipstick. -Oh, thanks.
I won $55 million, and increased my net worth by 40 percent...
...through a variety of well-chosen mutual funds.
-Forty percent? -At virtually no risk.
S & L funds, Biotech funds. Gold funds, they were a disaster.
Stay away from those.
Oh, I will. What do you think about Treasury Bills?
Well, they're for little old ladies. Which you certainly are not.
Aren't you a tiger.
How can you not have change for 20 dollars?
It's just not possible. You drive all day.
-We go get change. -No, we cannot go get change. You have to break this.
You have to break this.
Hi.
Well, hi. Hi. Can you break a 20?
Repeat after me: "Keep the change."
-"Keep the change." -Thank you.
Thank you.
-Oh my God, the boat. -Oh, no. Wait.
Wait!
I suppose your wife is....
She's in her element. Stockbrokers, CPAs, she'll probably have the time of her life.
-What about you? -I hate boats.
You wanna know the truth? I'm relieved.
-I think this is sturgeon. -This is definitely not sturgeon.
-It's just like velvet. -Scottish salmon. The very best.
More champagne?
-For pretentious California, it's not half bad. -You're not kidding. California?
Could have fooled me.
-Oh, God. This is living. -And it's just beginning.
-You can say that again. -And it's just beginning.
Very good.
Thank you.
It's a pleasure to have you here.
Can I get you a cocktail? Or some champagne, perhaps?
-Champagne? Champagne. -Very good.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
-You decided not to become an actress? -Yeah. I decided to become a waitress.
I had the "tress" part right.
-And I was a great waitress. -The "tress" part.
I saw you bought the place.
You saw?
-I passed by the other day. -And you didn't come in?
Well, I.... I don't know, I just.... I figured you were busy.
Please, you have to come in, you have to. You have to see what I did.
I established a table with your name on it, for people who couldn't afford a meal.
No.
Of course. After what you did. Of course.
What I did? I made a promise and I kept it, period.
-Most people would've done the same. -Nobody would've done the same.
Are you kidding? What you did was like a fairy tale.
And everyone gets to live happily ever after?
-Well, that's a hopeful sight. -You think?
I don't know.
I always wonder, what's in store for them?
Are they gonna be happy?
I mean, if she puts on 50 pounds or something, will he love her anyway?
-How long were you married? -Three years.
To an actor named Eddie.
Who suggested that if we had a child, we name him Al Pacino.
-Al Pacino Biasi. -Come on.
That's what I said.
Muriel and I met in high school, in one of those cooking classes...
...where all the guys dress up like Chef Boyardee.
And you figure any minute, there's gonna be a fire drill.
And you're all outside in your aprons?
Exactly. Even now, thinking about it, I get chills.
Anyhow, we started dating, and....
Muriel was the first girl I ever....
-Really? -Yeah.
-Well, that's sweet. -I guess.
We went down to the marriage-license bureau...
...and I remember, there was this other couple there.
They were Orthodox Jews. It was an arranged marriage.
An arranged marriage?
They weren't allowed to see each other. They were surrounded by their families.
They couldn't get a glimpse of each other.
And I remember thinking, "They don't even know if they're attracted to each other.
They don't even know if they've got anything to talk about with each other."
And here it is, ten years later...
...and I bet they're happily married with six cute little kids.
But Muriel and I have nothing to say to one another.
I don't know what happened.
It's like we're on two different channels now.
I'm CNN and she's the Home Shopping Network.
How would you feel about dancing?
Oh, I'd be in favor of it.
When I was a rookie, I had the night shift, and I felt like an explorer.
Because there's this whole other city that goes on all night long.
-Am I talking incessantly? -Yes.
But I like it. I myself am a talker.
So, I don't know.
It's nice to meet somebody who you can just talk with, you know, and hang with.
Look, here's the thing. I'm free all the time, basically.
So if there's anything you ever wanna do during the day...
...or you're alone and you don't wanna be.... Really?
-Sure. -How about tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
-Too soon? -No, not at all.
Okay, great. Okay. So, I'll have Carol watch the register...
...and you could come by, pick me up at noon?
I'll be there.
-Okay. -All right.
Thank you.
-Good night. -Good night.
Hi. Weirdest thing happened. I thought I'd dropped my wallet outside.
Weirdest thing happened. I came outside because I was feeling a little seasick.
Weirdest thing happened.
I have some wonderful ideas.
-Specifically with you in mind. -Hi.
Weirdest thing happened.
Wasn't the veal fabulous?
Fabulous. That was what was so weird. I didn't expect veal. I expected chicken.
I would have come sit with you, but Mr. Gross here....
-Jack Gross. -My pleasure.
Pleased to meet you, officer.
Charlie, he's going to help us develop an economic strategy.
-What a great idea. -You have some girl here, officer. Smart.
Beautiful. And she knows what she wants.
-See? -I agree.
-See? -I agree. Thank you very much for a very stimulating evening, Mr. Gross.
Thank you very much for a very stimulating evening, Mr. Gross.
My pleasure.
If you ever need any advice, either of you....
I will be calling.
-Well, ready? -Sure.
Come on, let's get upstairs. I gotta get my coat.
-Bye-bye. -Bye-bye.
Oh, no.
-You're doing great. -I never had great balance.
I tried skiing once. They threw me off the Peter Rabbit slope.
You gotta bend your knees. That's your problem.
That's one of them.
So now, there's a little bit of a hill here, so you might want to watch it, so don't--
-Slow down. -I can't slow down.
-Sure you can. -Sure I can-- I can't.
-Charlie, turn. -Okay.
-Are you okay? -Fine.
I mean, I'll probably catch leprosy from the water, but otherwise I'm okay.
So I guess this is it for you and rollerblading?
I would have to say yes.
Okay, your turn. What next? What do you want to do?
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Charlie Lang, and I've just won the lottery.
Tonight's ride home is on me and Miss Yvonne Biasi.
What's going on?
The cop and the waitress are treating everybody.
-This is going to be hard to top. -I'll top it.
The time is now 5:16 p.m.
Thank you for riding with the New York Transit Authority.
Welcome to Charlie Lang, Yvonne Biasi...
...Officer Bo Williams...
...and all the kids from Woodside, Queens.
I know, I know. I'm trying.
Out of there!
Third base!
Out of there!
Good one.
-Go. -All right.
-Come on. -Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.
Okay. Well, hey. Hey!
It was a great day. It was a great day for me too.
-What the hell is she doing? -She's pissed, whatever she's doing.
Muriel.
Muriel!
-Congratulations, Mr. Token Man. -Oh, God.
-Honey, I'm home. -No. No, you have to leave.
These are fantastic.
-Stop eating my macadamia nuts. -Give me a kiss.
No. No, I'm serious, I'm serious.
-You can't stay here. Out. -Why? You expecting company?
-No. No. -No?
Not Officer Krupke, the saintly cop?
There's nothing going on between me and Charlie Lang. And he's not a saint...
...he's just simply a decent human being. Something you couldn't possibly--
If you eat one more of those nuts, I swear to you....
Are you having an affair with this girl? No, of course not. We just hang out together.
No, of course not. We just hang out together.
You should've heard that Russian bitch downstairs.
"Oh, your husband and that waitress."
But, okay, what's the real issue here?
What's happening between us, or what some idiot neighbor thinks?
It's been like a cold war here. And every time I've tried to talk about it, you--
-All I have done is tried to make you happy. -No, that's not all you've tried to do.
I used to come home at night, and you'd throw your arms around me.
You'd kiss me and say, "How was your day?" When's the last time that happened? Five years ago?
When's the last time that happened? Five years ago?
-I have no idea. It's not important. -No, but it is important.
It's history.
-You go around with this girl. -I'm not having an affair.
This thing between you and the cop, frankly, it's none of my business.
But there is one thing that's very important, and it's this.
Don't be afraid.
"The Eddie Biasi Players."
You want money. Of course you want money.
Just 50 grand in seed money. And then we're off and running.
Okay, honey, look. Picture this, picture this. Please, please.
Of course not. Not you, not Mr. Saintly. You're too good to have an affair.
Oh, God, Charlie. I'm just so sick of it. Your niceness and your decency.
But you wanna know what?
You're nothing. You're a working-class stiff. You are blue collar all the way.
I'm not gonna change, Muriel.
I know.
-So I want a divorce. -You want a divorce?
As soon as possible.
I have wings, Charlie. I want to fly.
Honey? Honey?
All right, look, babe, the bottom line is, I'm sticking around--
Which I have a right to do. --until you kick in.
Well, you stick around, because I am out of here.
-Where are you going, big shot? -Get away from that door.
Where are you going? The Plaza?
-Yeah, the Plaza. -Really?
Really. And if you're still here when I get back, I'm calling the cops.
And believe me, I am now in a position to get them to come.
-Where you going? -A hotel.
-You mean, you and her? -We're history.
-Can't say I'm surprised. -No? It's funny, I am.
No matter what comes before, you just don't expect this.
What hotel, Charlie? What if I wanna call you?
I'll be at the Holiday Inn on Ninth.
-Holiday Inn? -Yeah.
-Charlie, you won the lottery. -Yeah?
One night at least, stay at the Plaza.
Maybe I will. You're a real pal, you know that?
I'll see you guys.
-Good evening. -Good evening.
-I'd like to get a room. -Yes, ma'am.
I'm not that waitress, if that's what you're thinking.
I didn't think so.
-Single or double? -A single.
-Smoking or non-smoking? -Non-smoking.
Sir, can I help you?
-He moved back in. -She threw me out.
Eight-11 is this way, ma'am.
Sir? If you'll just follow me.
-That was the cop. -That's the waitress.
Checked your bathroom yet? There's a robe in it.
-Are you serious? -Swear to God.
-Well, good night. -Come in.
Come in.
Thanks.
Unbelievable. Your room is exactly like mine, except it's a different color.
Your room is exactly like mine, except it's a different color.
They really.... I mean....
Hey, would you like some fruit?
You have some in your.... Every room in this hotel probably has fruit.
It's amazing.
-There's really a robe in there? -Terry cloth.
Nice. Really nice.
It's for sale. You can buy it for like $100 or something. I think it's $100, yeah.
I'll do it.
I'll split it with you. That way we can share it.
You can have it one month, and I'll take it one month.
Or every other day, or weekends.
-Or we could get two. -We could do that.
-Why am I so nervous? -I don't know.
-We've spent so much time together. -Maybe that's why.
-Hi. -Hi.
Here we go.
There they are.
-This is unbelievable. -Make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen.
-I mean, I've seen some offices. -Walter, please.
Boy, these guys must charge you an arm and a leg.
Why don't you sit down?
Just the chairs, Charlie.
-Would you like a glass of water? -Real leather. I thought so.
-Where's Muriel? -Mrs. Lang just stepped out.
And here she is.
-You had them done. -Had what done?
-Can we proceed please? -What did she have done?
What's the mystery?
-I'll tell you later. -I'm your lawyer.
As they say in Hollywood, let's cut to the chase.
It is our contention that there be no division of the lottery money.
This was Mrs. Lang's ticket.
-That's completely unacceptable. -It's all right.
-She can have my half. -What?
Come here.
Are you nuts? Why are you giving this away without a fight?
She can have my half, period. I don't wanna discuss it.
Don't wanna discuss it? You're talking a million dollars.
Walter, please.
You gotta be kidding me.
-We concede the point. -That's a very mature attitude.
It'll certainly help speed things right along.
Well, now, as to their pre-lottery holdings...
...we have a bank account here totaling...
...$3611. I insist we split this 50-50.
Chump change.
Well, that's basically it. There's furnishings, some good linens.
Not quite accurate, Mr. Zakuto.
We are also attaching the monies given by Mr. Lang to Miss Biasi.
-What? No. -That is out of bounds.
Mr. Lang volunteered his wife's earnings from the lottery...
...without her consent or previous knowledge.
That's horrible, Muriel. For God's sake. Please, think about what you're doing.
We have every reason to believe that he and Miss Biasi...
...have had a long-standing relationship...
...that he deliberately deceived his wife about.
And toward that end... -...we have drafted this letter to Miss Biasi... -Come on!
-...we have drafted this letter to Miss Biasi... -Come on!
...demanding that she return the money... ...immediately and in full, or face substantial penalties and damages.
...immediately and in full, or face substantial penalties and damages.
-I can't believe this. -I can't listen to this screaming.
-Our whole marriage was like this. -It was not like this!
Why are you doing this?
Just to get even with Yvonne? She didn't do anything wrong.
I am tired of this physical abuse from you. Did you see that?
If you fellows need a cab, my secretary will call one.
How am I going to say this to Yvonne? How am I gonna tell her?
Charlie, you're not gonna like this...
...but you're gonna have to stop seeing her for a while.
Hi. This is Yvonne Biasi. I'm not at home right now.
Please leave a message after the beep. Thanks so much.
Yvonne, I just wanted to say I'm thinking about you.
And we're gonna win this thing, because it's right.
Don't think any of this is your fault. It isn't.
If you need me, I'll be at Bo's, 555-3840. I guess I'll see you in court.
Well, I hope you don't mind sleeping on the floor.
Oh, no, thank you.
There's beer in the fridge, and the TV's there.
Sure is nice of you to let me use your Barney blanket, Tracey.
That's okay.
-Good night. -Good night, Gail. I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it, man.
Thanks.
"The trial, which has attracted citywide interest... ...begins in civil court this morning at 9:30."
...begins in civil court this morning at 9:30."
-This whole thing is unbelievable. -My money's on Yvonne.
God, I hope so.
Now, Mrs. Lang, what are the numbers for your birthday?
Twelve, 16, 64.
Twelve, 16, 64.
And the numbers for your anniversary, my dear?
Six, 26, 84.
Six, 26....
Did I hear 26?
Twenty-six?
As a matter of fact, Mrs. Lang, weren't you married on the 27th?
Yes. So your husband picked the 26 on his own?
-Objection. What's the point? -The point is, counselor...
...the point is, Your Honor, I am demonstrating...
...that Mr. Lang is responsible for the winning ticket.
Overruled.
So, Mrs. Lang, your husband picked the 26th on his own, correct?
-No. -No?
Mrs. Lang, there was you, there was your husband.
Could you kindly tell us who else was there that morning?
My dead father.
-Excuse me? -My dead father, God rest his soul.
Quiet, please.
He came to me in a dream. "Baby," he says, as he was floating out the window.
You know, he had these big wings, you know, like angel wings.
Oh, my God. They were the perfect color of white leather.
Anyway, he says, "Baby, it's time to go to the church.
You gotta hurry up or you're gonna be late."
To my shock and surprise, I'm standing there in my wedding gown.
So I was running down Queen's Boulevard, through Flatbush.
Even though Queen's Boulevard doesn't run through Flatbush.
I came to the church: St. Catherine's of the Holy Lotto.
And then I realized I wasn't late, I was a whole day early.
God, I wanted to die.
Then my father, you know, he was there, he was standing right next to me.
And he says, "Little girl, don't cry.
Because to me, your anniversary will always be on the 26th."
Mr. Lang.
Have you ever purchased nail-polish remover for your wife?
Quiet, please.
Nail-polish remover?
-A couple of times, I guess. -And you paid for it?
-Sure. -Did you therefore consider it yours?
No, I guess I didn't.
Isn't it true that you forced your wife to split the ticket with Miss Biasi?
I only said we should do the right thing.
Mr. Lang, were you wearing a gun at the time?
No. Of course not.
-You hit her, didn't you, Mr. Lang? -I never, ever--
You are under oath, Mr. Lang.
-Okay, once I grabbed her arm-- -No further questions.
Your witness, counselor.
Miss Biasi. Would you describe your financial circumstances...
...before Mr. Lang was kind enough to offer you half his wife's winning ticket?
I was struggling to make ends meet.
Isn't it a fact you owed $12,000 on your MasterCard?
-That's because my ex-husband-- -Just answer yes or no.
Technically, yes. But that's not because I had overspent.
And isn't it also a fact that you filed for bankruptcy...
...on the very day Mr. Lang offered to split the ticket?
Yes. But that was just fate.
-Right, fate. -Yes. Really.
Let me ask you, what was your relationship...
...with Mr. Lang at the time he offered to share his wife's ticket with you?
-I'd never met him before. -Really?
Yes, really.
Describe your relationship with Mr. Lang today.
I love him more than anything in the world.
Which is why you went running off to the Plaza with him... ...on the day he separated from his wife.
-Objection. What is the relevancy of this? -Motivation.
What motivation?
Mrs. Lang had thrown Mr. Lang out of the house...
...the marriage was in complete disarray.
-Overruled. -If you're implying what I think--
Miss Biasi.
They're trying to make me into a gold digger. Him, the media.
Miss Biasi. Control yourself, please.
I've worked my whole life. And finally something wonderful happened to me.
I met a man who was intelligent and kind and full of compassion.
Just the experience of knowing him has changed my life. It's not the money.
It's because he made me believe again people were fundamentally decent.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let some lawyer make our relationship look ugly.
Are you divorced?
No.
You're married to one man, and you're in love with another.
It's only because I couldn't afford to get divorced.
Well, that's convenient.
In dramatic testimony, Yvonne Biasi was depicted by Muriel Lang's attorney...
...as a gold-digger and nymphomaniac. A verdict was expected by this evening.
-Has the jury reached a verdict? -We have, Your Honor.
What say you?
We rule in favor of the plaintiff, Mrs. Muriel Lang, on all counts.
The court would like to thank the jury for its service in this difficult case.
Court is dismissed.
-About the reports of Yvonne's adultery-- -Shut up about her.
She's down there.
Yvonne!
Yvonne!
-Mrs. Lang? Your reaction to the verdict? -Justice was done.
Don't you believe that the good deeds of your husband--?
This is not a press conference. The verdict is in. We're happy, that's all.
Very happy.
I don't even know where she is.
Look, you'll be a cop again. It's what you love.
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Go away.
Yvonne.
-No. You don't wanna be with me. -What are you talking about?
-I love you. -No. Don't you get it?
I've ruined your life.
Are you crazy? These past couple of days, I felt like half of me was missing.
You won $4 million in the lottery. Do you know what an amazing gift that is?
And because of me you have nothing.
Because of you, I have you. Why can't you understand that?
If you don't want me, that's different.
If you don't want me, I'll walk right out that door, and you'll never see me again.
But please stop talking about the money. It means nothing to me.
Do you want me to go?
No.
Never.
Never, never.
You have to excuse me sometimes, it's just... ...nobody ever loved me before.
-I guess he wants some food. -Shall we invite him in?
Why not?
We should leave New York.
I mean, we're like freaks here.
I've got a cousin that lives in Buffalo.
He keeps asking me to visit.
Maybe we can stay there for a while.
I could join the Buffalo force.
I could be a Buffalo waitress.
Tonight I, Angel Dupree, a photographer for the New York Post for 10 years...
...had the opportunity to study grace... ...and generosity under the direst of circumstances.
...and generosity under the direst of circumstances.
Even in their darkest hour...
...the stalwart Officer Lang and the good-hearted Miss Biasi...
...shared a bowl of soup with me.
When I left, this Good Samaritan gave me money from his own pocket...
...wishing it could be more.
-"Mail it to Yvonne's Coffee Shop." -It's a good idea.
It's a great idea.
I just want to make one stop.
-Sweetie. -I'm okay, I'm okay.
-I knew this was a bad idea. -No, I just wanted to see it again.
Why is the gate open?
I don't know. Well, Carol has a key.
The door's stuck.
-What is this? -It must be some kind of a mistake.
-"The Good Samaritan's Fund." -"Lotto Lovers."
"Yvonne's Coffee Shop."
-It's 5 dollars. -Oh, come on. No.
"There should be more people in the world like you. Ethel from Staten Island."
Here's a check for 10.
This is all for us. Oh, Charlie.
"You are an example to all of us. Betty and Phil, the Bronx."
"We are hoping you will have a wonderful future."
"The Garcias, Long Island City."
It took Charlie and Yvonne three days to open all their mail.
And when they were done, New York had given them a $600,000 tip.
Charlie happily went back to the force.
Yvonne got her coffee shop back.
Eddie could only get work driving a cab.
And Muriel. She married Jack Gross...
...who cleaned out their checking account and fled the country.
Muriel lives in the Bronx with her mother now and works in a nail salon.
Charlie, Muriel and Yvonne all lived in a city...
Who is he?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Just shut up, Angela. Let him do what he wants!
Just shut up, Angela. Let him do what he wants! -No! No! -No!
All right, go ahead.
No!
No! Grandpa!
No! No!
No!
Help me! Help me!
Please don't kill me.
Okay, people.
Now please take your time in answering this question.
I want you to take a good look at Mr. Boffano, the man seated in front of you there.
And tell me if you've ever seen him before.
No, sir, I haven't.
I'm sorry I can't hear you. Would you pull the mic a little closer, please?
No, sir, I haven't. -On TV? In the newspapers? -No, sir.
-On TV? In the newspapers? -No, sir.
Do you read newspapers, ma'am? When I have the time.
How often is that? Never.
I am a single mother, Your Honor, and I am trying to be a sculptor.
I have, well, a job all day and when I get home I take care of my son
I feel stupid saying that I don't keep up with the news, but...
I feel stupid saying that I don't keep up with the news, but... Well, that's just how it is. I don't. I don't have time.
Ma'am, are you saying that you've heard nothing about this case?
Well, no, I have heard something.
When I told my son that I might be picked for jury duty, he said,
"Hey, maybe you'll get picked for that big mafia case."
And I said, "What big mafia case?" And he said, "You know, Louie Boffano.
He's gonna be tried for popping those guys."
He's gonna be tried for popping those guys." And he said that popping is when you kill somebody.
I said, "Okay, I've got that. But who's Louie Boffano?"
And he said, "Mom, come on, he's the big SpaghettiO."
Okay, people. Enough!
Well, ma'am, what I want you to understand is that this may be a lengthy trial,
Well, ma'am, what I want you to understand is that this may be a lengthy trial, and that you would be sequestered during deliberations.
So if you tell me that it would prove a grave hardship for you to serve on this jury,
I'll excuse you.
Well, then I think I could get someone to take care of my son for when I'm sequestered.
to take care of my son for when I'm sequestered.
You would like to serve?
Yes, I would. Yes.
Hey, Eddie, that license is registered on the name of Annie Laird.
Hey, Eddie, that license is registered on the name of Annie Laird. 48 Seminary Lane. Pharaoh, New York.
Thanks, Joey. Take care of yourself.
Hey, guess what? You were a star today. -That's bull. I was zero-kid today. -Why?
Do you know where Jesse is on Dragon Rider?
Do you know where Jesse is on Dragon Rider? He got to the fifth dome last night, man. I can't believe it.
I can't get to the second dome without some stupid-ass troll slave clobbering me.
Well, maybe Nintendo's not your forte. Mom, it's not Nintendo. It's Sega.
Maybe you should focus on something else, like your homework.
Anyway, you were a star today. The star of county court.
I told them my son called Louie Boffano the big SpaghettiO,
and it got a big laugh.
You're on that case? Well, that's the one if they take me.
All right, she just picked up her kid at her babysitter's or something,
and we're going west on Ratner away from her house.
Well, thank you, Eddie.
Hey, stay with her. I'm gonna check out her place.
Yeah, right.
It wasn't just the old godfather that got killed.
They killed his grandson, too.
It made me start thinking about you and... I don't know. I'm always talking to you about responsibility, right?
Okay, so it wasn't such a good idea. But it is a little bit exciting.
I need a little excitement.
Eddie, what's going on?
All right, I don't know where the fuck we are. Looks like some kind of fucking whacked-out church or something.
Maybe she's some kind of religious freak. Look, Vince, I think we ought to let this one go.
I mean, this whole thing, it just don't smell right to me.
Eddie, you're fussing.
She's at work. Relax. Yeah, right. Whatever.
And, you know, anything in the Reporter Dispatch about the trial, anything at all, you're gonna have to cut it out so I don't see it.
Mom, you don't read the papers, you use it to wrap stuff. Whatever. Just do it.
And, you know, when the jury deliberates, I'll have to be sequestered, which means I'll have to stay in a motel and you'll have to stay with Mrs. Kolodny.
which means I'll have to stay in a motel and you'll have to stay with Mrs. Kolodny.
Mrs... Oh, shit! For how long? I don't know. A week, maybe two, however long it takes.
I don't know. A week, maybe two, however long it takes.
-Mom, tell me you're kidding. -I tell you I'm not kidding.
Well, why? I mean, come on. You just go in, you come back out and you say "guilty."
-Oliver. -What? -Oliver. -Say, "Fry the sucker."
Come on, how long does it take? I don't know, but do you think you can shut up?
-Six seconds? -Oliver.
-"Oliver." -Oliver.
And end the letter, "Sincerely, John Slivey.
Devotional Services Incorporated. Books for the Soul."
Oliver?
Math. Now.
All right, she's walking towards the car with her kid.
Hey, Eddie, what do you think of her? What do you mean, "What do I think of her?"
I don't think nothing of her.
Do you think she's sexy? Come on, she's a fucking mommy.
Well, I think she's sexy, and smart.
This isn't your average mommy, Eddie.
I just think she's trouble. Well, I think she's brilliant.
She makes sculptures that you can't see, that you can only feel.
Yeah, you want to get out of there? She's coming your way.
All right, they just turned into the driveway. You better get the fuck out of there.
Come on, for Christ's sake, get the fuck out of there.
They're going in the front door. Go out the back.
Vincent, what the fuck are you doing?
Oliver.
All right, they're going in the front door. You gotta get out the back. Are you hearing me?
Come on.
-I'm hungry. -What do you want?
-Is there anything to eat around here? -Maybe a cockroach or two.
Mom, it's your duty to feed me.
-No, I'm sorry, can't do it. I'm busy. -What? Feeding your buddy, Dragon Rider.
All right, you turn on the machine and I'll call for pizza.
-What do you want on it? -Some sausage.
Sausage. Get out of my face!
Sausages isn't crap. What do you mean? Sausage is good. No. Hi, yes, I'd like to order a large pizza, please.
-Use your ax. -Okay. Okay. Turn around and go and get him.
Go, go, go... Die, you sucker.
Okay, you got him. Hit him again. Hit him again. -Go. Go. -Again. Again.
-Don't get away. Hit him again. -I got him.
-I did it. -Okay. All right!
Okay. You're getting hit. Get him. There we go.
No.
-Chill out, Momba. -Okay. Okay.
Just raise your ax. -Remember, I told you. -Right there. Yeah, yeah.
Okay, now don't get hit by the fist. Hit him! You're just, like, gonna sit there.
Okay, I'm gonna get him. There we go. You cannot run from the wrath of Momba!
The Momba!
-Hey, Lainie. -Hey, Annie.
-Is she here? -Yeah, she's coming right out.
His name is Mark Cordell. He's... Well, I don't know... He's very polite, but he can be very intimidating.
He's very polite, but he can be very intimidating. You know what I mean?
He knows his shit, Annie.
He does Alice Aycock, Christy Rupp.
Anyway, he collects for himself, but mostly for friends. And I mean big, big collectors, honey, big, big shits.
And I mean big, big collectors, honey, big, big shits. Like?
Sato Makamoto. Bidi Karamora.
My stuff's gonna go to Japan? I don't know, just some of the names he mentioned.
-Wait a minute, you didn't ask who? -Of course I asked. He gave me vague.
And that was good enough for you?
Well, that and a check, for $24,000.
Half of which is yours.
God, do I need this!
Annie Laird? I thought it might be you.
Inez said you might drop by so I took a chance.
I bought some of your pieces. I'm Mark Cordell.
-Hi. -Hi.
I've got a check in my bag. Thank you. Well, I didn't pay you nearly what they're worth.
No. Please, please.
How do you know me? Have we met before?
Inez showed me your picture in the catalog. Oh, God.
Well, you know, she said that my pieces were gonna go to Japan. Is that true?
-Yeah, that's likely. -So does that mean that's it?
-Yeah, that's likely. -So does that mean that's it? I'm not gonna see them again. No, not necessarily. No.
Do you have some time to talk this over? Maybe have some lunch?
Now? You know, I'm... I'm supposed to be upstate by two o'clock for jury duty.
I'm supposed to be upstate by two o'clock for jury duty.
Well, I wouldn't wanna make you late for that.
Well, maybe just a quick bite.
So what was the first one? Okay, the first one. Let me see...
The very first one.
When my parents split-up, I went to stay with my grandmother for the summer
in Allentown, Pennsylvania. I hated it.
So I made this model of a wild meadow.
And I would keep it under the bed.
It had these bushes. It had thorns that I made out of staples,
It had these bushes. It had thorns that I made out of staples, and there was a stream made out of tin foil.
And I would reach under the bed, you know, 'cause I was afraid of the dark,
and I would reach under and just touch it
and... dream I was there.
-And that's how you got started? -Yeah.
So what about you? Were you afraid of the dark?
Well, it wasn't really very much dark in my house. We had a lot of kids. I was the youngest.
We had a lot of kids. I was the youngest.
A real madhouse, you know... a zoo.
Anyway, you wanna know where your pieces are going, yes?
Do you know Japan?
Well, contemporary art is a sort of currency there now
because its value is so inconstant.
It's so attractively pliant.
Wait a second. I'm lost.
I'm not connecting the dots here. None of that really matters. All that matters is we need to start getting new pieces,
All that matters is we need to start getting new pieces, try to record some six figure sales,
get you the right review in Artforum, a proper niche at the Basel Art Fair.
That sort of thing. But that's my job, don't you worry about that.
-Listen, Mr. Cordell, I... -Please.
Call me Mark. Okay, Mark.
-May I call you Annie? -Listen...
-May I call you Annie? -Listen... Yeah, you can call me whatever the hell you want,
but I'm not interested in having my art used as some kind of currency.
Annie, what do you think I get out of this?
You think I make money off of this? I don't. I don't need to.
What I do for a living pays me very, very well.
-Could I get you guys-- -No. Not now.
I do this so that artists like you can go into your studio
and work on your boxes and not worry
and work on your boxes and not worry whether or not your children are being fed.
So that these idiots that control the art world, these insects,
you don't have to bother with them.
So you can just do your work.
-Hey, you guys. -Okay, what do you think?
Forget about it. You're wearing the black one. -You look sexy in it. -The black one?
Juliet, will you stop it. I do not wanna look sexy.
-I'm not wearing the black one. -Well, too bad.
And promise me you won't be shy with this guy. I'm not shy.
-No? -No. I'm private.
No, no, no. You clam up.
I just don't babble to men, that's all.
Babble? Annie, this is not babble, this is an art.
First you say something to pump up his little ego, and then,
First you say something to pump up his little ego, and then, with a sly little, subtle savvy you puncture his balloon.
Then you stroke his silly little ego again,
and then you push him back, and you pull him in, and you push him back, you pull him, and you push him, and you pull him
until you've got him dizzy and staggering and falling at your feet.
-Juliet? -Yeah.
When's the last time you slept?
You mean "sleep" sleep? Not just closing my eyes for a second while I'm doing a tracheotomy?
I don't know. I slept for a couple of hours on Monday night.
-Jesus! Why aren't you at home, in bed? -Would you cut it out?
-Jesus! Why aren't you at home, in bed? -Would you cut it out? I'm going to take the kids to a movie. This is a cinch.
-Annie? -What?
How could I not come?
This thing today was the triumph of your life, girlfriend.
What?
You you You did it
What did I do? You sold three goddamn pieces!
You know what? I did!
Laozi says that returning is the movement of the Dao.
So are you a Daoist? I don't know.
Laozi says that when the foolish man first hears of the Dao,
Laozi says that when the foolish man first hears of the Dao, he laughs out loud, which is certainly true in my case, I'm afraid,
but I also find it very compelling.
"Become a valley, stop fighting against that structure
"Become a valley, stop fighting against that structure against that fate, what have you,
and everything will flow to you."
What do you think?
I think we need to take a left.
-Should I just... -Yeah, any one. It doesn't matter.
Just like the ones in the gallery. You just stick your hand under and--
Just like the ones in the gallery. You just stick your hand under and-- Cop a feel, yeah.
"The Dream of Giving Notice."
What do you feel? A keyboard.
A computer keyboard and something rough on the keys. Is it sandpaper?
This is... What is this? This is wire.
This is a cage.
This is a birdcage.
I'm caught in a birdcage.
The door is open, but I can't quite squeeze through.
And now I feel a breeze on my fingertips just beyond my reach. How did you do that?
And now a fluttering...
This is a bird. This is amazing.
This is also a little bit strange. I mean, reaching up underneath here and feeling your...
I mean, reaching up underneath here and feeling your...
Private stuff? Private stuff.
My God! Annie, it doesn't have to only be a dream.
You can give notice. You can escape that hell.
You can do nothing but just make art for the rest of your life.
Would you like to feel another one? There's a really good one right over there.
-This one? -Yeah, that one.
But I've already felt that one.
No, no. That one's the one... I just finished that one.
Well, I felt it yesterday.
Yesterday? I didn't even know you yesterday.
But I was here.
You're kidding, right?
Don't get up.
Annie, listen to me now.
You're in danger and your son is in danger. Oliver. What do you mean? Where's my son?
He went with Jesse and Juliet to the movies, didn't he?
He's gonna be all right.
Such an extraordinary child.
Remember last night, when the two of you were playing that video game upstairs
and you started to panic and he said, "Chill out, Momba." You remember that?
How do you know that?
Annie...
when I heard the two of you, together, laughing, I swore to myself that I would do everything
I swore to myself that I would do everything to make sure that he gets through this.
Do you understand me, Annie? This is a very dangerous time for him.
He could stray.
He could commit some childish error and we could lose him.
That quick.
But you know what I think? I think he's gonna be safe.
I think he'll grow up and he'll be healthy.
And your friend, Juliet, she'll be safe too. She'll be fine.
Everyone you care about, they'll all be safe as churches.
Do you hear what I'm saying? Annie, nod your head now. Do as I say.
Annie, nod your head now. Do as I say.
And, as for you...
all you have to do is wait.
That's all.
And then someone is going to contact you and tell you to say two words.
Two precisely.
Do you know what they are? Have you guessed yet?
No.
Not guilty.
Okay, Annie's home.
-Okay, brat, see you later. -Okay, I'll see you later.
What do you want me to do?
Protect him.
Tell him that your date turned out to be a creep.
Hey. Hi there.
-Hey, you all right? -Yeah.
-Hey, you all right? -Yeah. It's nice to see you.
-What's the matter? -Nothing. -Did you have a good time? -Yeah.
-Did you have a good time? -Yeah. -So what's the matter? -Nothing, nothing.
Things just didn't go great with that guy.
-Is he still gonna buy your boxes? -Doesn't matter.
-Here. -Are you okay? I am fine, sweetie. Go. I'll be up in a minute, all right.
Just go on.
I still wanna buy your boxes. No, I don't want you to buy my boxes.
I insist. Annie, this will be over before you know it.
-What? -Annie. Hey, what's up?
Boone? Yeah, it's me.
Oh, Jesus. How are you? I'm good. How the hell are you?
I'm good. How the hell are you? Hey, listen, don't go anywhere, I've to put money in the phone, okay?
Hey, listen, don't go anywhere, I've to put money in the phone, okay?
It's the 1950s here. Don't do anything. It's gonna sound like we're disconnected. Are you there?
Yes, that's better. So, I brought one of the kids down to the hospital today,
and I just thought I'd grab a chance to call you.
How long has it been? How long since we talked?
Well, I don't know, probably the fall, sometime in the fall.
No, has it been... It's been that long. You know, I've meaning to call, but I'm still three hours from the nearest phone.
but I'm still three hours from the nearest phone. It's just not that easy.
How are you guys anyway? How's Oliver?
Annie? Are you there? Yeah?
Yeah, we're okay.
Yeah, we're okay. Good. I thought I lost you. Listen, Annie, book your airline early this time, okay?
Listen, Annie, book your airline early this time, okay? Because last time you know what happened.
You know, I don't think we'll be able to make it this summer. I'm sorry.
You're not gonna make it? Annie, you'll miss the fiesta. Why?
you know, just because we had a connection once, about a million years ago,
doesn't mean that you can just keep popping up into my life whenever you want.
Annie, what's the matter?
I have someone here and he doesn't like these phone calls,
and, frankly, neither do I.
Okay.
Sorry. I didn't know.
You okay?
Yeah. And I'll be great when I can just get back to sleep.
Good night, Annie.
I'm talking to the Teacher and he says to me, "Man don't want to come out of his house. Man don't want to be killed."
So what?
So we could dig a tunnel.
-You remember what he said to me, Paulie? -I remember, Louie. I remember.
And I say to the Teacher, I say, "You wanna dig a tunnel?
Okay, dig a tunnel. Just kill that cocksucker."
Mr. DeCicco, that is you on the prosecutions tape, -isn't it? -Yeah.
It's you and Louie Boffano talking about the Teacher. Yeah.
So, who is this Teacher? I don't know.
Do you know why he's called the Teacher, Mr. DeCicco?
'Cause when you see him, school's out.
School's out. Meaning?
What the fuck you think it means? Means you're dead.
Mr. DeCicco, not here.
-Sorry. -Did you have any direct dealings with this Teacher?
No, nobody knows who he is. He just does special jobs for Louie.
But didn't you testify yesterday under direct
But didn't you testify yesterday under direct that the Teacher had suggested a strategy for negotiating with the Cali Drug Cartel.
-Maybe, but he didn't-- -It was the Teacher
who arranged the link between Louie and the Calabrian Mafia, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Two alliances Salvador Riggio bitterly opposed.
Yeah.
And then one day the Teacher said he could dig a tunnel to the house of Salvador Riggio for the purpose of killing him, right?
Right.
And Louie Boffano said, "You wanna dig a tunnel. Okay, dig a tunnel."
Yeah.
After all, the Teacher was the boss. -He can do what he wants, right? -Come on, give me a break.
-He can do what he wants, right? -Come on, give me a break. Teacher's not the boss.
You know of a single case in which his counsel wasn't followed, Mr. DeCicco?
I told you, Louie's the boss. Louie gives the orders.
You mean Louie seems to give the orders, right?
Mr. DeCicco, do you know what a puppet is?
-Objection, Your Honor. -Sustained.
I'm sorry. Let me put it another way.
This is a puppet. Maybe it seems to make its own decisions.
Objection.
Sustained. Mr. Bozeman, this is not a circus.
I withdraw the puppet. No further questions.
The reporter will strike that remark from the record.
The jury will disregard it. Counsel, take that puppet and put it away. I just sustained an objection to it.
Counsel, take that puppet and put it away. I just sustained an objection to it.
Oliver? -Oliver? -Yeah.
Please get down here.
Anybody here?
Well, I'm not in the mood, okay?
-What is it, Oliver? -Mom...
What is this? This is my math...
What is this?
I thought I told you never to come here.
Well, I... You know, I need some help.
Could I get a few bucks on next month's rent?
-What the fuck is this? -Don't touch that!
It's a piece of art.
Rodney, it's a very delicate piece of art.
There you go. Here's somebody you have got to meet. You have got to meet Lorraine.
Lorraine? Who's Lorraine? My girlfriend.
What's this? More art?
That's my girlfriend.
And, yeah, it's a piece of art. These are all pieces of art.
That's why I didn't want you dropping by unexpectedly because I'm...
working on some very important pieces.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'll see you later.
Going to do better.
You know, you've said that before.
You know what? I don't want to discuss this, okay?
Just get your coat on and let's go. We don't have anything to eat in this house.
Hey, I know you.
You're the artist, right? Box lady?
Buddy of mine, Mark Cordell, bought a couple of your pieces.
This your kid?
-Hey, how you doing? Nice to meet you. -Hi.
What were those frozen things that you like?
-You mean Bubble Pops? -Yeah, go get some.
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m. The park and ride in Banktree.
-It's off 684, you know it? -Yes.
What did I say? The park and ride, 684, in Banktree.
What time? 7:00 a.m.
Look, you'll be fine.
We're not animals.
I got a kid, too, just a little older than him. Teenager.
Anyway, I just want to tell you I know what you're going through, and hang in there.
What's your name?
I can't tell you my name.
What do I call you then?
Call me Cap'n Crunch.
Captain, thanks.
How are you holding up, Annie?
How have you been feeling lately?
Why don't you tell me? You listen to every word we say.
I don't enjoy invading your privacy.
-You don't? -No.
But we can't afford the slightest error.
Now, I'm gonna say something to you that might be unwelcome, but I'm gonna say it nonetheless,
I think you're being a little harsh with your child.
He may start to ask questions. He may talk to his friends.
He won't. He won't.
I just want to finish this as quickly and as painlessly as possible,
but I'm gonna need your help.
We have to work together, Annie. I'll do what I can, all right?
Do you understand what our strategy was in the courtroom yesterday?
What was our strategy yesterday?
Louie Boffano didn't order the killing.
He's in the mob, maybe a bad guy, but just a figurehead.
He doesn't give orders.
That's right.
And if Louie Boffano isn't guilty then who is?
And if Louie Boffano isn't guilty then who is? Who did kill Salvador Riggio?
You did.
You think I'm the Teacher, Annie?
Aren't you?
I would have you believe that.
The Teacher scares you, doesn't he, Annie?
Well, I'm sorry for the fear. If I had any choice...
Any choice... But...
if I can keep you scared... I can save your life.
Then he got down on the bed between my husband and me.
And he put his gun on Sal, on his mouth.
And what did the man do then, Mrs. Riggio? He said, "Open up, Sal, I don't wanna make a mess.
He said, "Open up, Sal, I don't wanna make a mess.
"I don't wanna scare your wife. "We gotta work together, Sal."
-And then? -Then he killed my husband.
He killed my Sal. Shot him.
And what happened next? Then the door opened and my...
Mrs. Riggio, did someone come in?
Tommy, my grandson.
He came in the room,
and he saw my Sal dead. And then what happened?
Then the man, he saw my baby.
And Tommy ran away, he ran down the hall.
He ran after him.
Then I heard the shot.
He killed my baby!
No further questions.
-Oliver? -Yeah.
Mom,you know, Juliet called again. It's only, like, the tenth time.
-What's he doing here? -What do you mean? Jesse?
You're supposed to be doing your homework. Bye, Jesse.
See you later.
Who the hell has been cutting into the newspaper?
I did. You told me to.
You know what? You never do anything that I ask you to. Why the hell did you have to do this?
'Cause you told me to!
What did it say? You're not supposed to know what it says.
You said you weren't supposed to know what's in the paper or on TV. That's not right.
You don't tell me what's right and wrong, you got it?
-Now, what the hell did it say? -I don't know.
-Now, what the hell did it say? -I don't know. Well, did it say Boffano was guilty?
-I don't know! -What did it say?
Was it compelling evidence, persuasive evidence, -do they want you to think he's guilty? -Mom, everybody knows he's guilty.
-do they want you to think he's guilty? -Mom, everybody knows he's guilty. What's the matter?
What do you mean everybody?
-Who the hell have you been talking to? -Nobody. You asked me not to.
I am not asking you, I am telling you.
You talk to anybody about this trial, and I swear to God, I will beat the shit out of you.
Do you understand me? Do you?
And that bullshit crybaby stuff stops right now!
Oh, shit.
I can't... I can't do this.
Where is everybody? Did I get this wrong again? Oh, jeez.
Did I get this wrong again? Oh, jeez.
What do you mean? What time are you supposed to be here? I was supposed to be here now.
You know what? I'm gonna go see if they're in the old practice fields.
Hold on. -Oliver! -Just hold on! Get back here! Oliver, I don't want you going!
Get back here! Oliver, I don't want you going! Just stay there!
We need to talk. I have to go. I'm gonna be late.
I have to go. I'm gonna be late. -And I-- -Walk with me.
-I can't. -What if I were in trouble? -What kind of trouble? -What if I were in really bad trouble?
-What kind of trouble? -What if I were in really bad trouble?
What is it? Like a man, or work? What is it?
What if I couldn't tell you? What do you mean, "If you couldn't tell me?" I'm your best friend. You've got to tell me.
I'm your best friend. You've got to tell me.
-So you would tell me? -Of course.
Then do that.
I can't tell you what to do, Annie, I don't have a kid.
Still you love him. You love him as much as I do. Don't you?
Tell me what to do, Juliet.
I think you've got to go to the judge.
You're gonna go to the judge,
you're gonna tell him that your son got sick.
Tell him that your son just got diagnosed with leukemia.
-He's not gonna buy that. -Yeah, he will.
If you have a note from your doctor. From me.
Okay?
I don't know.
I don't know. It just sounds sort of crazy.
You're right. What you're doing, the way you're handling it, going along with these guys. It's much smarter.
-Then why did you-- -Because I don't take orders very well.
From monsters, I don't take them at all. But that's just me.
He's your kid, Annie.
Once we're back in the car, you never talk about this. Okay?
Not a word, not a question. Say it. Say, "I'll never talk about this in the car."
I'll never talk about this in the car.
"Or in the house." Or in the house.
I knew it. -Oh, God. -You're just too smart.
I'm glad you figured it out.
And I'm glad you went to Juliet.
-Are you scared? -Yeah.
But we're gonna turn this thing around, okay? Yeah.
Excuse me, may I help you?
I just need to see the judge.
What are you doing here? I need to see you.
You know who I am.
Yes, you're a juror. Open that door, please.
I wanna talk to you alone.
Let me just explain something to you.
When you come into my chambers, this is not a trivial thing.
When a juror visits a judge, this can have serious consequences.
if you still have a problem and you wanna talk about it,
then I'll call the Defense Attorney and the DA and we'll sit down and talk--
No, I wanna talk to you alone.
I don't want them. I only wanna talk to you.
-Alone? -Alone.
Well, you can't talk to me alone and whatever that is,
Well, you can't talk to me alone and whatever that is, I don't wanna see it. Not without the attorneys present.
Are you telling me that I'm making a mistake?
Madam, what I remember about you
is that I gave you every opportunity to get out of serving on this jury.
But you insisted you wanted jury duty. Do you recall?
Well, you want to serve, you don't want to serve.
You have a problem, but you don't think the defendant has a right to hear it.
Well, I think you're wrong.
He happens to be on trial for murder.
He was every right to hear it.
Now...
shall I try to locate his counsel? No, I've changed my mind.
You and your fucking '77 Knicks.
You think your fucking Earl "The Pearl," could play John Starks?
Hey, man, Earl "The Pearl" would've blown fucking John Starks right out of the Garden, my friend.
John Starks would take Earl "The Pearl..." Annie, I'd like you to meet Rodney.
Annie, I'd like you to meet Rodney. Rodney, this is my friend, Annie.
Your girl is a fucking knockout.
Rodney, here, is about a half a gallon of sewage that just backed up from New York City, Annie.
Hey, don't give me that shit!
I offered to drive Rodney home because I think he's had a little bit too much to drink.
Annie, would you like to ride with us?
Shove it up your ass. -I'll drive my own car. -Hey, man, get in the car.
-I'll drive my own car. -Hey, man, get in the car. Come on. I want you to get into the backseat, 'cause I want Annie to ride up front with me.
Rodney is not making a great success in his sojourn here on earth.
He's a drunk, he's an imbecile. You button up that bum hole, buddy.
But his friends take good care of him. Even after all those DUIs,
he's still on the road.
Hey, you said you had some scotch, right?
Break it out, shit-for-brains.
Annie, could you reach into my bag and take out the bottle that's in there?
-This? -Yeah, that's it.
-I don't want you to spill any, Rodney. -What do you think?
I'm gonna stick this in my face? Just suck on it.
If you think it's gonna affect my high regard for you, Rodney, well, it won't.
You asshole.
Just lie down, Rodney.
I've put something in there to make you sleepy.
So go to sleep. Go to sleep.
-What are you doing? -I'm doing Rodney.
I wanna see what life is like through Rodney's eyes.
And just like I thought, it is one big blur.
Look at Rodney now, Annie, look at him. He's just like the rest of us.
Spending all of his time trying to stay out of the way of fear.
Anything to not feel fear. Anything.
Don't you ever feel fear? I feel it all the time, Annie. I had a bout with it today.
But you know, Annie, I bow to fear.
But you know, Annie, I bow to fear. It's terror that teaches me my shape, Annie.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Lacrosse. They say it's the most dangerous sport in the country,
but I guess if it weren't very dangerous,
but I guess if it weren't very dangerous, then young boys wouldn't wanna play, would they?
Oliver plays lacrosse, doesn't he?
What are we doing here? I wanna teach you what you love, Annie.
The gray suits want you to love the law, justice,
but what good are the gray suits?
Are they gonna shield you?
Are the gray suits gonna shield you, Annie?
Can the gray suits shield you from somebody like me?
I mean, look at me! I'm Rodney. I'm old, and I'm tired,
I'm Rodney. I'm old, and I'm tired,
but when I'm behind the wheel of this car, I'm a young buck again.
I might take this curve here a little too fast.
Please stop!
Look, I didn't tell the judge, I swear! I did not tell the judge.
I didn't tell him!
-Who's gonna protect you, Annie? -You will.
-Who's gonna protect you? -You will.
And I want you to say it! "The Teacher will protect me!"
The Teacher will protect me!
-Say it! -The Teacher will protect me!
-Say it again! -The Teacher will protect me!
Sure, you can put the Teacher in jail, you can sizzle Louie Boffano,
but what are you gonna do about this drunken Rodney behind the wheel of this car?
I'm looking down this road and it's just one big blur to me!
But I think I see a boy on a bicycle who looks an awful lot to me like... Hey.
Oh, God, no!
No! Oh, God! Please no!
-Who will protect you? -Please, no!
-The Teacher! -Who will protect you?
-The Teacher! -Who will shield you? -Say, "The Teacher!" -The Teacher!
-Say it, "The Teacher will protect me!" -The Teacher!
-Say it! Again! Again! Again! -The Teacher will protect me!
Here.
You can't let him drive like that! You're absolutely right, Annie.
He could hit somebody.
No!
Make sure she gets home safe, Eddie.
Where you going?
Why did he do that?
'Cause you scared him.
You don't ever wanna do that shit again 'cause he will hurt you.
I don't wanna see you get hurt.
You said you had a kid, right, captain?
Eddie. My name is Eddie.
Yeah, I got a daughter. 14.
Why do you let him do these things?
You got too many questions. Come on. Let's get out of here.
Hey, Mom. Do you think we could go to the mall later? No.
-Get some ice cream? -No.
I wanted to tell you about my day.
Did you talk to Juliet today?
Juliet? No. Why don't you finish your homework?
Did you talk to Juliet today?
Did you talk to Juliet today?
Juliet? No. Why don't you finish your homework?
He looks good. -You gonna examine me like that sometime? -You wish.
-You gonna examine me like that sometime? -You wish. You're on call on Saturday night.
You said he can be reasoned with.
But he can't.
-What happened? -We tried it your way, Juliet. And it didn't work out.
Now, you've got to promise me that you're gonna stay out of our lives.
And that's what Oliver wants, too?
Well, Oliver thinks that we should be heroes, but he's wrong.
But he's promised to keep his mouth shut so that's all that matters.
And now you've got to promise, too. Promise you what? I'm going to abandon you?
That you're gonna keep your mouth shut and stay out of our lives.
It's my life, right? Isn't that what you said? My life, my kid?
-Right? -Yeah. Promise me.
I promise you.
Hey, Oliver. Hi, Annie.
-Oliver... -Puberty.
Okay. "Guilty." "Guilty."
"Guilty."
-"Not guilty." -What?
That's what it says. Calm down.
"Guilty."
"Guilty."
"Guilty." "Guilty."
"Guilty."
"Guilty." "Guilty."
"Not guilty."
-Two... -So we have 10 guiltys and two not guiltys.
Wait a minute. I mean, I'm sorry, but how can anybody think this guy is not guilty?
I mean, who voted not guilty? Can I ask?
You can ask, but nobody has to say if they don't want to.
-I voted not guilty. -You did? Why?
I don't think the government proved its case.
-Guys, guys, come on. -"Proved?" It's open and shut. So you say.
I mean, we have the tape, right? Did you hear the tape? So you say.
Roland, you're gonna drive me nuts.
Look, suppose they were all lying, all the witnesses.
The cop, the mule, DeCicco. We still got the goddamn tape.
I mean, it's on the tape that he says... What is it about the tunnel?
-Yeah. -I says to the Teacher, I says,
"You wanna dig a tunnel, dig a tunnel, kill that cocksucker."
I mean, you think he's talking about the Tunnel of Love?
Hold on.
Don't tell me you're the other one. For Christ's sakes.
Look, that tape, I mean, does that prove anything?
-I mean, it wasn't a direct order. -Right.
"Kill that cocksucker." That's not a direct order?
-Come on, he could've just been bragging. -He was bragging.
He was bragging how he'd send a hit man to kill Riggio.
You know, maybe it's not fair to pick on the not guiltys.
You know, maybe we should have to explain our case. You know? What's our evidence? Let's start with that.
What's our evidence? Let's start with that. This is ridiculous.
Man, come on, sit down. It's the process.
We're gonna be stuck in that motel for weeks.
Despite substantial evidence in the State's case against mob boss, Louie Boffano,
speculation turns toward the possibility of a hung jury
as deliberations move into the third day. In other news...
I wanna know why you're not leaning on the union guy.
Its making me nervous.
Because he's not powerful enough. That's why. Is that right?
So this artist broad, she's the one with the power now, huh? We hope so, yeah.
Well, you know what I think? I wanna go with the union guy.
And when my father's away, I'm the boss of this family,
so I think you'd better listen to what I'm telling you, okay?
Let's go.
Joseph.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Go back to the car. Let me ask you something.
Do you take money from my family?
I take a great deal of money from your family, but that doesn't make you in charge. I mean, Joseph, your father knows what's going on.
I mean, Joseph, your father knows what's going on.
I don't like you, okay? I don't like what you're doing to my family,
I don't like the shit you're getting us into with these Cali assholes,
these fucking guys from Calabria!
You act like you're some fancy, sweet-smelling piece of shit.
You're from the same neighborhood that I'm from, that my father's from.
You know what I think? I think you're just a sick fuck.
I know you're a friendless fuck.
You always was, even when you was a little kid.
Even Eddie. He thought you were smart, he brought you into the family,
but even him, he don't like you.
Nobody likes you.
I got work to do. Hey, listen to me!
Go with that union guy.
-Hello? -When your roommate falls asleep again,
-Hello? -When your roommate falls asleep again, come out to the balcony and slide the door shut behind you.
come out to the balcony and slide the door shut behind you.
Annie. Come here.
I want you to take this and stand over there and pretend to be smoking.
It's risky to talk but I wanted you to know, Annie, that you're never out of my thoughts.
Will we win? -No. -Why not?
-No. -Why not? He's guilty.
The others, they know it.
Annie, if the jury hangs, if there's a mistrial,
then the people I work for, they will hurt you just to punish me.
Hold on a second. That's not part of the deal. I thought if I kept voting not guilty...
That's not part of the deal. I thought if I kept voting not guilty... No, no, we have to have an acquittal.
Do you understand? We have to win this thing.
You're out of your mind. Annie, that's why I chose you.
I chose you over all of the other jurors because I know who you are
I chose you over all of the other jurors because I know who you are -when you wake up. -Look, I can't turn black into white.
-when you wake up. -Look, I can't turn black into white. Louie Boffano could not possibly have done this.
You have to teach them that. He doesn't have the brains, he doesn't have the courage, he's a clown, he's disposable.
he doesn't have the courage, he's a clown, he's disposable.
But you, on the other hand, can do what I'm asking you to do
because you have the spine.
That's what you and I have in common.
We're artists. We're intelligent. We have passion.
We're intelligent. We have passion. But Louie Boffano? Please.
It just isn't possible.
What do you want me to do? Threaten them? The jury is afraid.
They're instinct is to acquit.
They're just waiting for somebody like you to march in there
They're just waiting for somebody like you to march in there and give them the excuse to do it.
I can't.
You will.
I got you something.
And I want you to wear it.
Please take it.
Don't worry. I'll be with you every step of the way.
You're being completely unreasonable.
Two people testified against the Teacher. They talk about him on the tape!
How can you admit he didn't even exist? I don't know who he is!
It doesn't matter who he is!
The only thing that matters is you know how powerful he is.
Can't you see that? Didn't that get through to you?
-Annie. -What?
-There's no need to raise your voice here. -Sorry.
What, are you crazy? Kayaking? Well, actually, what I love the most is ocean kayaking.
You know, like down South at night.
You know, there's this phosphor in the water...
-What would you like? -Fruit punch.
And it's like...
Thanks. It's, like, lit, you know?
-It's beautiful, it's amazing. -Really? It's an amazing thing to see.
You're pretty wild. You are quite a free spirit.
Well, you know...
You know, I was thinking that maybe, if you'd like,
after this is over, we could go kayaking together on the Hudson sometime.
I'd really like that. That can be really great. Sometime.
Really? That's cool.
Think about how they sounded when they said his name, "The Teacher".
Almost whispering.
And that guy, DeCicco, when he said "The Teacher,"
he was looking around that courtroom and he was scared to death.
-Bullshit. -Hey, take it easy.
Well, no, it's all right. Go ahead, Barry. What?
God damn it. Boffano is the boss! They work for him!
Thank you.
I don't know.
I think maybe Annie's got a point here. Again?
Okay. Wait, okay?
They've got all of these deals. Cali, the Calabrians,
the government of... What is that? The government of what? Curaçao, okay, so they've got that, they've got Jamaican runners.
Curaçao, okay, so they've got that, they've got Jamaican runners.
So there this whole huge web
with one spider sitting in the middle of it, one guy scheming this whole thing.
And you think that's Louie Boffano? All right, so the Teacher advises him. Big deal.
The Teacher doesn't advise Boffano.
He told him, "I'm gonna dig a tunnel to Riggio's house and I'm gonna kill him."
But Boffano gave his okay. He said, "Kill that cocksucker."
Okay, so suppose I said, "I'm gonna kill this guy right here."
And you said, "You know what? Great. Do that. Kill that cocksucker."
Now, does that make you a murderer?
I don't believe this. You really want us to let this grease ball go free?
You know, I really don't care for the term grease ball.
All right, I'm sorry. But, I mean, how much goddamn evidence
All right, I'm sorry. But, I mean, how much goddamn evidence -do you people want? -Evidence, you know, that's there...
It isn't what we want. The evidence to get is beyond a reasonable doubt...
"Reasonable." That's what I'm talking about.
Listen. What the hell is reasonable? Use common sense.
Does that mean every infinitesimal, little, teeny bit of goddamn anything that's possible?
teeny bit of goddamn anything that's possible?
-Can I finish, please? -Why should we let you go on and on? You're not saying anything new.
So what are you thinking?
What I'm thinking is these people are scum. And I...
You know what?
I don't care anymore, one way or the other.
I'm tired.
-Reasonable doubt. You got it. -Hold on a minute.
Maybe I don't understand the evidence.
But I know a kid got killed. That's it.
I mean, a little boy.
And if we set this guy free,
I know what he's going to do.
He's going to go right back to selling drugs,
hurting more people.
Annie, I don't need evidence for that.
I know it.
And, Laura, the evidence says that the Teacher ordered the killing,
the evidence says that the Teacher ordered the killing, not Boffano. The Teacher.
Do you have a child? -What does that have to do with it? -It has everything to do with it.
-What does that have to do with it? -It has everything to do with it.
I have a boy, Laura.
And I am terrified that something could happen to him some day.
And I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that we've got to protect the children.
There's all of this chaos and it just keeps getting worse and worse.
And there's nowhere to go to get away from it.
But the law says that if they don't prove that Boffano committed the crimes
But the law says that if they don't prove that Boffano committed the crimes he's charged with, prove beyond a reasonable doubt,
then we have to set him free. We have to, even though we hate it.
And you just pray that you get him next time.
But if you twist the law even just a little for the best of reasons...
then the law loses whatever power it's got.
And then my child is in even more danger than before.
And so are your grandchildren.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, do you find the defendant guilty or not guilty?
On both counts, we find the defendant not guilty.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Prisoner is released. This court is adjourned.
-Justice! -Yeah!
You can't have none of him He's our Louie
Sorry Miss DA But I think he's just wrong for you
Welcome home, Louie!
We tipped the scales on our side, eh?
This is to the trial being over.
And to a friend being home. Finally. Drink up.
I got a new boyfriend.
Okay, I know what you're thinking, but he's a very cool guy. Takes pictures, travels around the world.
Takes pictures, travels around the world.
God, I'm having just so much fun right now, I can't stand it.
Are you guys fabulous? Your wonderful personalities are coming right out--
I don't feel like celebrating. Can I be excused?
Congratulations, Louie.
I wasn't concerned, you know? Not for a minute!
I swear, if I'm lying, may God strike me dead on this spot.
Come here, come here.
-Congratulations, Louie. -Wonderful.
You know, that jury lady...
I didn't like the way she looked at me.
She made me a little uncomfortable.
Well, she's afraid of you, Louie. But I wouldn't worry about it. She's not gonna be a problem.
-No problem at all. -"No problem?"
What, is everything no problem to you?
The last time I heard "no problem" from you was with Sal fucking Riggio,
and then there's some kid who was there that you should've known about, but you didn't, and bada-bing my father's on trial for his fucking life!
but you didn't, and bada-bing my father's on trial for his fucking life!
I mean, two made guys whack each other. Who gives a fuck? But you killed a kid.
Now the state's got a hard on for my family ten fucking yards long
because you killed a kid!
You're my son. My son.
What are you gonna do? He worries about me.
He thinks you're a psycho.
Whatever he says, he says out of love for his father, so...
Go ahead. Give me the money.
Are you sure we're not gonna have any problem with this woman?
Don't worry about it, Louie. No problem. I got my eye on her.
Miss Laird, get up quietly, speak to no one. Come with me.
Your bank account shot up to $12,000 last month. -I sold some art work. -Good for you.
-I sold some art work. -Good for you. But you know what?
We don't really care how you got it.
'Cause we don't think you did this for the money.
We think these guys scared you.
They're still scaring you. Now it's time to stop being scared.
Let us get you out of this mess. How would you do that?
You help us, you testify for us,
we're gonna put you somewhere safe. You and your boy.
we're gonna put you somewhere safe. You and your boy. -And then what? -Whatever you want.
-And then what? -Whatever you want. The mob aren't what they used to be, Ms. Laird.
They don't often kill civilians.
Now can I go?
-Not yet. -Yeah, hold it.
Well, then I'd like to make this quick, 'cause I wanna to get home before my kid gets out of school.
Send a car over and have the kid picked up.
No! You just stay away from my house!
You put me in danger when you come around my house,
don't you bastards understand that? In danger, Ms. Laird? From what?
From the man in the moon.
Suppose there were an unfortunate leak to the press to the effect that you were cooperating?
"Juror brings tampering charges against Boffano." That'd make a great story, wouldn't it?
You know, you do this, and they'll kill my child.
No, they won't. You help us, they won't.
They always threaten. Always. But they don't do squat.
Who else is gonna protect you?
Look, I'm not saying no. But I'm gonna need some time to think about this.
-How much time? -Just a day or two.
-How much time? -Just a day or two. But you keep your people away from us.
You wanna watch me, okay. But don't you let anybody know you're watching. Do you hear me?
I'll give you 48 hours. When you're ready to talk, find a secure line. Dial this number.
You can trust anybody in this room.
Paul!
I had a shitty day.
-Let's see what we can do about that. -Oh, good.
-Give me another one. -That's a bad idea.
I'm a doctor. I know what I'm doing.
I want you to do something for me.
What else? What else could I possibly do for you?
I want you to take these.
What are they?
Secobarbital and Amobarbital.
Stuff like that.
No, I don't want you to take them for me. I want you to do it for Oliver.
-Who are you? -Well, haven't you figured that out yet?
I'm Annie's friend.
You had all the answers when you told Annie to go see that judge, didn't you?
When you put Oliver at risk. This boy that you care so much about.
Then you had ice in your veins.
Then you wanted to be the big heroine.
Now I'm gonna give you a chance to be a real heroine.
Because after what you've done, this is Oliver's only chance.
I care about him just as much as you do but I will kill him.
I told Annie what would happen if she betrayed us.
And I am a man of my word.
The way of power is the unvarying way.
Now the police are with Annie...
and we have to give her a little taste of grief to save Oliver.
and we have to give her a little taste of grief to save Oliver. Just a little inoculation to make sure she stays afraid.
Just a little inoculation to make sure she stays afraid.
-No! No! -Take it. -No! -Take it. Take it.
Fuck. Help!
Take it.
There. Drink it. Drink.
No one at the hospital would believe it. Why would she kill herself...
She's gone. I don't know if the feds got her in a safe house or something.
But she cleared out all her bank accounts. She took that money you gave her. -And she's gone. -Hey, it's all right.
-And she's gone. -Hey, it's all right.
I mean, she's never gonna betray us.
What are you kidding me? She hates our fucking guts.
All she needs is some time to be alone. I'm so sick of that bullshit with you.
How the fuck do you know that? Because a friend of hers died last night.
Who died? The doctor.
Annie is in great danger and her child is in great danger
and I will do everything that I can to protect them.
Now what part of that don't you understand?
I mean, I could explain it to you.
That's all right.
I don't need your explanations.
Hello? -Miss Emma Faldo? -Yes, speaking.
-Miss Emma Faldo? -Yes, speaking.
Yes. This is John Slivey in New York.
Your cousin, Annie Laird, was working for me up until about a week ago and she listed you as an emergency contact
and she listed you as an emergency contact and I have a paycheck for her and no way to reach her.
and I have a paycheck for her and no way to reach her. -Do you happen to know where I can... -I'm sorry. I can't help you.
-Do you happen to know where I can... -I'm sorry. I can't help you. -No? -No, I'm sorry.
-Well, that's too bad. -I wish I could be of more help.
Anybody else in the family might know how to... -No, I don't think so. -...reach her?
-Not since... -Really?
It is easy to lose touch.
-Talk about a surprise! -God!
-Uncle Boone. -Oliver! Look at you! Hey!
Here. Over here.
You guys are gonna love it here.
You know, tomorrow I'm gonna take you to this beautiful Mayan altar.
Wish I had more time!
More time? Annie, when you live here, it's all you have, is time.
I have to go back. And I need you to take care of Oliver.
What? Wait a minute.
Look, you have to do it. There's no one else.
There's no way you're going back. You're not leaving.
-I'm not letting you go back. -It's not your choice.
Your choice is you can take care of Oliver, or you can send him home with me to be killed.
And I'm asking you to take care of Oliver.
I know what I'm asking. I know it's too much.
But there's no one. There's nobody else I've got to go to.
Please. You're my oldest friend. Why do you want to go back?
I have to.
-Hello? -Yeah, she came back.
She what? She came back. Just like you said she would.
Yeah, she wants to meet you tomorrow. One o'clock.
-Hey. -Yeah, I'm here. Why the fuck would she come back?
Well, she had to come back.
She got her child to safety. She took him to this little village in Guatemala.
She took him to this little village in Guatemala.
Some place that I could never find them. And she had to come back.
I mean, everything that we've been through is like a marriage, Annie and I.
She couldn't let it go. She couldn't.
-No, it's too dangerous. -But it's the only way.
If he finds out you're wired, you're dead.
He won't. -What if he pats you down? -He won't.
He thinks that I'm timid.
He would never touch me unless I wanted him to.
He likes to be thought of as a gentleman. Ms. Laird, I don't wanna lose control here.
I don't wanna put you in an unsafe situation. Oh, and you think that I'm safe here with you?
Listen. Please, just give me the wire.
Please.
I will get you such juicy stuff on Boffano
that you could lock him up for the rest of his fucking life.
You could put them all away.
What do you think of them? My guardians. They're clueless.
My guardians. They're clueless. Incompetent.
They irritate me.
You know what irritates me most is their weakness.
Well, I think that you should forgive them. Their hearts are fine and they do love you, Annie.
Don't tell me that.
Don't you talk to me about love and forgiveness.
Oh, you bastard!
I hate you, you know that. I would kill you if I could.
Or is this the lesson for today, Teacher?
Or is it how terror is doing me so much good? How strong it's gonna make me?
Or is it how your love is gonna save my child?
-Annie... -You shut up!
Don't you smile at me.
Don't you ever fucking think you can smile at me.
Don't you even look at me.
You wanna know what I hate most?
I hate that you were right.
I am stronger.
Annie...
Is that all that you feel?
Stop. Just stop.
Do you hear that?
I went back to my studio again. Looked at all my old work.
And it all seemed just so restrained. Smothered.
No fire. No guts. Just the way my life has always been.
Smother the passion. Anything that you're frightened of...
lock it out.
I don't wanna live like that anymore.
I don't want any more weakness.
And this is what I don't understand.
You have all of this strength and you work for Louie Boffano, that...
Goon.
Well, he's your friend.
Louie Boffano doesn't have any friends.
He's a monster. And like most monsters, he commands some respect. But not for long.
My colleagues from Cali are growing very tired of him.
Are you gonna get rid of him?
Well, eventually we'll discard Old Louie, but for the time being, we might keep him as a figure head.
but for the time being, we might keep him as a figure head.
Take the heat off of me. Let him be a mountain. I'll be a ravine.
God, I'd like to have a place like this someday.
With a farmhouse, wood floors,
a child playing in the yard.
A child like Oliver.
And after that, I want nothing... but love.
Do you think I can turn myself into sheer love, Annie?
Do you think I have that power?
I'm sorry that you hate me.
Because I do love you.
What the hell were you doing?
The door opens, the door shuts. Then nothing.
Look, Eddie was driving around. The Teacher just never showed up.
Look, maybe he guessed something was going on. How would he guess that?
I don't know. You figure it out. Me, I'm going home.
We're not done yet, Ms. Laird.
Oh, yes, we are.
If you want anything else out of me tonight, you're gonna have to arrest me.
Annie?
Don't call me Annie. Ms. Laird?
Who the hell is this?
-Stop. -It's okay. It's okay. I know her.
-Hey, what are you, deaf? I said stop. -It's okay. -I said stop. -It's okay. I know her.
Mr. Boffano, I need to talk to you.
What can I do for you?
Do you recognize me? Yeah, sure. You're the juror lady.
What do you want? I have something to show you.
You got something for me? -What? -A gift.
-What? -A gift.
I give you a gift and you leave me, my friends and my family alone.
Of course. I would never hurt your family, nor you, nor nobody.
I would never hurt your family, nor you, nor nobody.
-Lady, I don't even know you... -Swear it, and I'll give you your gift.
Hey, I'm not interested in your fucking gift. -Oh, yes, you are. -Lady.
Hey, hey. Easy, easy, easy.
She's got something you gotta hear.
-Come here. -Go ahead.
Louie Boffano doesn't have any friends.
He's a monster. And like most monsters, he commands some respect. But not for long.
But not for long.
My colleagues from Cali are growing very tired of him.
Did you enjoy that, Mr. Boffano?
Would you like to hear more?
When did you tape this? Yesterday.
-And who wired you? -I wired myself.
Let me have it.
-Not until you swear. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, I swear.
-Not until you swear. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, I swear. I'm out of your life forever. Let me have it.
I wouldn't waste any time.
-Vince. -Hey, Ed. What are you doing here?
Louie wants to meet.
When? Today. Six o'clock. Palisades.
I don't know. The meetings are so risky, you know.
I mean, can't you just tell him to relax?
Yeah, yeah. Sure, I'll tell him. No, he says it's important.
Why all this urgency?
It's about Annie. He says he can't trust her.
Wants her taken out.
What do you think, Ed? You think she needs to be taken out?
Since when does anybody give a shit what I think? Right?
Well, I mean, you just seemed to have developed a certain amount of fondness for her lately, you know.
Yeah, well, that's history.
It's just business, right?
-Yeah. -Well...
Do what you gotta do. Six o'clock, right? Yeah.
So every other day of the year, they call him San Simón, and they treat him with great respect.
But tomorrow, they'll call him by his real name. Judas.
They take him to that tree over there and they hang him.
Oliver? What's wrong?
When's she coming back? -Dr. Boone! Doctor! -Hey, just one second.
-Dr. Boone! Doctor! -Hey, just one second.
Oliver, she left you here because she loves you,
Oliver, she left you here because she loves you, -okay? -Yeah.
Here. Go have some fun, all right. I gotta go deal with this. I'll catch up with you, all right.
I don't think we have to worry about that.
-Yeah. -What's in the case? Open it up.
I'll just have to get back to you.
Vincent. I'm glad you came.
What's this?
I want you to take your money back.
Things got a little more complicated than we hoped, so the money's yours.
Let's walk. We need to talk.
It's more than ten years, we've been working together. Isn't that right?
-Yeah. -You know what...
-Yeah. -You know what... I don't know the first thing about what makes you tick.
Isn't that funny?
I mean, in all those ten years, I don't know nothing about you.
Until this woman, I mean, this juror woman,
this morning, to my mother's grave she comes.
-And she says to me-- -What?
Annie came to see you.
She said you've been saying ugly things about me.
Said you called me a motherfucking monster.
Oh, please. Don't even try to deny it.
It's on tape.
That woman, you know the one you've gone soft over,
you think is the love of your life...
she wants you dead.
You said you were gonna discard me.
Now look who gets discarded.
Get it done.
And everybody thought you were a genius.
Hey, Joseph. Take a look at your father.
You're fucking crazy.
Bada-bing!
-Eddie? -No, it is not Eddie.
-Eddie? -No, it is not Eddie. He's right here. Would you like to speak with him?
Annie, I suppose I should be angry with you for betraying me, but I'm not.
I know that this has been hard for you.
I did things to protect you and Oliver.
It must have been difficult for you to grasp.
What you would say, what you would do to protect your child.
I mean, you bring Oliver down to Guatemala and then what?
You're gonna come back here and you're gonna destroy me?
Well, that is not going to happen.
Do you remember what I told you at the studio that night?
I told you if you would trust me, then Oliver would be safe.
But if you betrayed me, then no matter what the personal cost to me, Oliver would suffer. Do you remember that?
And I begged you to believe me. But how can I ask you to trust me
when mistrust and betrayal are rooted in your character.
I can just as easily ask you to change the pattern of the stars.
But now Oliver is going to die in the morning. We both know that.
And there's nothing we can do to stop that.
We can only witness.
Enjoy your flight, Mr. Wordham. You can board now.
Here's my ticket. I'm sorry, you've just missed this flight.
-Ma'am? -Look, I have to... My son is dying, okay. I got to get to the gate. No, ma'am. I'm sorry. Well, we can put you on another flight.
No, ma'am. I'm sorry. Well, we can put you on another flight.
If you hurry, there's another flight to Guatemala via Houston.
-Where? What gate? -126.
-Habla inglés? -Yes, I do.
-What's your name, man? -Danielle.
You think I could hire you to give me a ride somewhere?
No, I'll give you a ride. You don't have to pay.
It will be a long journey.
Can I have a car?
I got to have a car. I have a lot of money. I just need one car.
I have a lot of money. I just need one car.
Look, I don't care. Here's everything I've got, okay. Just get me there.
Oliver?
Oliver?
What is this? A fucking zoo?
-Annie! -Get back, Boone. Right now.
-Mom! -Oliver, get out of here. Get him out of here! Get him out of here!
-Let go! Mom! Get off! -Annie!
Annie, you really are astonishing.
I mean, you won over the jury...
and then you set me up with Boffano.
And now you've chartered a plane. Yep. With your money.
But you're right, Annie. You have to kill me.
I see that now. It has to be that way.
Because if you shoot me...
then you and I will be bonded forever.
No, we won't!
We do honor to your courage and speed, your strength.
CHINGACHGOOK [IN ENGLISH]: Hello! John Cameron!
JOHN: Chingachgook. How are you?
CHINGACHGOOK: The Master of Life is good, John.
Another year passed.
-How is it with you? JOHN: Getting along. Yes, I am.
JOHN: Nathaniel.
HAWKEYE: Hello, John. Cleared another quarter, I see.
JOHN: Yes, I did.
-Alexandra. -Welcome.
HAWKEYE: Jack. How are you? JACK: Hello, Nathaniel.
-How've you been? -Good, thank you.
JOHN: Where have you boys been trapping?
CHINGACHGOOK: West of the Concanoga.
ALEXANDRA: Why is Uncas with you?
He should have settled with a woman, started a family by now.
GIRL: Hey. Hey, Uncas, look.
Mohawk field we saw was five-mile long on the river.
Chief Joseph Brandt's field.
ALEXANDRA: Take much fur? -That we did.
-Lots. -The Horican is near trapped out.
Where're you trading? Castleton?
-Schuylerville. -Schuylerville, with the Dutch for silver.
French and English want to pay with wampum and brandy.
So, what is it, Jack? What brings you here?
French and Indian army are heading south
out of Fort Carillon to war against the British.
I'm helping raise New York's militia to fill the Crown's levy.
Are the people here gonna join in that fight?
JACK: We'll see in the morning.
Where you boys heading?
HAWKEYE: We'll trap over the fall and winter in Can-tuck-ee.
Find a Delaware-speaking woman for Uncas.
She will say, "You are the one." Bear him many children.
JAMES: Then you can have a boy like me.
UNCAS: Never. You're too strong.
-Turn me old too fast. ALEXANDRA: That's what he's doing to his mama.
ONGEWASGONE: John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality.
Mohawk got no quarrel with Les Français. Traded furs with Les Français.
Now, Les Français bring Huron, Ottawa, Abenaki onto Mohawk land.
Now Mohawk will fight Les Français and Huron.
I speak for the Twin River Mohawk of the Six Nations.
His Majesty King George II is very grateful for your support.
How far up the valley?
-Up to Fort William Henry. MAN 1: That's two nights and a bit from here.
Should be enough to remind you France is our enemy.
MAN 2: France is your enemy.
LIEUTENANT: What did you say?
While we're at your fort, what if the French attack our homes?
-What then, lieutenant? -For your homes, for King, for country!
That's why you men ought to join this fight!
HAWKEYE: You do what you want with your own scalp.
Do not be telling us what we ought to do with ours.
You call yourself a patriot? And loyal subject to the Crown?
I do not call myself subject to much at all.
I agree with some of what Nathaniel and John say.
But I believe England's still our sovereign.
MAN 3: I'll go. MAN 4: We're gonna go fight the French.
MAN 5: My brother and I will volunteer. MAN 6: I'll fight with you, Jack.
JOHN: I'm staying on my farm.
Any man who goes, his family's welcome to fort up with us till he comes back.
Boys, my sense of it is, we have enough here to fill the county levy.
It's a fight we ought to make.
First, we've got to get terms from General Webb.
MAN 7: What terms? MAN 8: Where are you meeting him?
We'll go to Albany.
GUARD: Attention!
-Help my men outside with the baggage. -Yes, sir.
If they're not allowed leave
to defend their families and homes if the French attack,
no colonial militia is going to the Fort William Henry.
They will report or be pressed into service.
I cannot imagine His Majesty, in all his benevolence, would ever object
to his loyal American subjects defending their hearth and home,
their women and children.
Does that mean they'll be granted leave to defend their homes
if the settlements are attacked?
Of course.
You got yourself a colonial militia, general.
MAN: Tis what we wanted.
Major Duncan Heyward reporting, sir.
En route to Fort William Henry and bearing dispatches.
Safe journey, I trust?
DUNCAN: Yes, and I didn't experience anything so surprising
from Bristol to Albany as that, that I witnessed here today.
And what was that?
The Crown negotiating the terms of service.
I know. One has to reason with these colonials to get them to do anything.
Tiring, isn't it? But that's the lay of the land.
I thought British policy is "Make the world England," sir.
I see you're to serve with the 35th Regiment of Foot
at Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro.
I'll be marching the 60th to Fort Edward.
Explain to the major he has little to fear
from this General Marquis de Montcalm in the first place,
and therefore scant need of a colonial militia in the second
because the French haven't the nature for war.
They'd rather eat and make love with their faces than fight.
Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters?
I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
You there. Uh, what does Munro call you?
The Scotsman has sent you one of his Mohawk allies to guide you.
Magua.
WEBB: The Scotsman's daughters are at the poltroon's house.
A company of the 60th will accompany you,
and Magua will show you the way.
Dawn, at the encampment, 6 a.m. sharp. See to it you're there.
SERVANT: I'll take it for you, sir.
Cora.
Duncan.
-How long have you been in Albany? -For days and days. And yourself?
Just arrived.
By God, it's good to see you.
I don't know what to say, Duncan.
I truly wish they did, but my feelings...
don't go beyond friendship.
Don't you see?
Respect and friendship. Isn't that a reasonable basis
for a man and a woman to be married? All else may grow in time.
-Some say that's the way of it. -Some?
-Cousin Eugenie, my father-- -Well, then, Cora...
in my heart, I know.
Once we're joined, we'll be the most marvelous couple in London.
I'm certain of that.
So why not let those whom you trust, your father,
help settle what's best for you?
In view of your indecision, you should rely on their judgment.
And mine.
Will you consider that?
Please consider that.
Yes.
Yes, I will.
ALICE: Duncan!
DUNCAN: By God, you've grown up.
ALICE: We leave in the morning?
-Yes, miss. -I shan't sleep tonight.
What an adventure. Have you seen the red men?
A few.
ALICE: I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square,
having been to the wilderness. It's so exciting.
Alice?
ALICE: Can we rest soon? DUNCAN: Absolutely.
You there.
Scout.
We must stop soon. Women are tired.
MAGUA: Not here. Two leagues. Better water. We stop there.
DUNCAN: No, stop in the glade just ahead.
When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
[IN HURON] Magua understand white man is a dog to his women.
When they want to eat, he puts down his tomahawk to feed their laziness.
Excuse me, what did you say?
[IN ENGLISH] Magua said, "I understand English very well."
MAN: All company on the center!
Right! Step to the right!
Prepare your firearms!
Make ready!
MAN: Make ready!
Right, men. Close your rank!
DUNCAN: Fire!
No, Duncan.
In case your aim's any better than your judgment.
Your wounded should try walking on back to Albany.
They'll never make a passage north.
ALICE: Stop it! Stop it! We need them to get out!
DUNCAN: Why's he loosing the horses? -Why don't you ask him?
Too easy to track.
They'll be heard for miles.
Find yourself a musket.
We were headed to Fort William Henry.
We'll take you as far as the fort.
We're walking out of here fast.
Unless all of you'd rather wait for the next Huron war party to come by.
Scout, I'd like to thank you for your help. How much further is it?
A night and a bit.
Appears we're well away from them.
Maybe. Maybe they ain't alone.
-That Huron captain back there-- -The guide? He's a Mohawk.
No Mohawk, he's Huron. What reason did he have to murder the girl?
What?
The dark-haired one.
Miss Cora Munro? Murder her? He never set eyes on her before today.
She's only been here a week.
No blood vengeance? No reproach or insult?
Of course not.
How is it you were so nearby?
Came across the war party. Tracked them.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
No.
Fort Edward, then?
Heading west for Can-tuck-ee.
There is a war on. How is it you are heading west?
Well, we kind of face to the north, and real sudden like, turn left.
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia.
The militia is fighting the French in the north.
I ain't your scout. And we sure ain't in no damn militia.
Clear it up any?
Ottawa, two Français.
DUNCAN: What did you say?
Mirrors, tools.
And clothes.
Everything was inside. They didn't take anything.
They were moving fast.
Another war party.
Let us look after them.
CHINGACHGOOK: Leave them.
CORA: Whoever they are, though they're strangers,
they're at least entitled to a Christian burial.
-They can't be left behind. -Let us go, miss.
I will not. I've seen the face of war before, sir,
but I've not seen war made upon women and children.
And almost as cruel is your indifference.
Miss Munro.
They're not strangers.
And they stay as they lay.
Why didn't you bury those people?
Anyone looking for our trail would see it as a sign we'd passed that way.
You knew them well?
You were acting for our benefit and I apologize.
I misunderstood you.
Well, that's to be expected.
-My father warned me about-- -Your father?
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
Oh, he did?
-He said, "Do not try to understand them." -What?
Yes, and, "Do not try to make them understand you.
That is because they are a breed apart and make no sense."
CORA: Why did they turn back?
Burial ground.
A breed apart, we make no sense?
In your particular case, miss, I'd make allowance.
Thank you so much.
Where's your real family?
They buried my ma and pa and my sisters.
Chingachgook found me with two French trappers, raised me up as his own.
I'm sorry.
I do not remember them. I wasn't but 1 or 2.
How did you learn English?
My father sent Uncas and I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was 10.
Why were those people living in this defenseless place?
After seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed here
because the frontier's the only land available to poor people.
Out here, they're beholden to none.
Not living by another's leave.
Their name was Cameron.
John and Alexandra Cameron.
My father's people say that at the birth of the sun
and of his brother, the moon, their mother died.
So the sun gave to the earth her body, from which was to spring all life.
And he drew forth from her breast the stars.
The stars he threw into the night sky to remind him of her soul.
So there's the Camerons' monument.
My folks' too, I guess.
You are right, Mr. Poe.
We do not understand what is happening here.
And it's not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London.
-Sorry to disappoint you. -No, on the contrary.
It is more deeply stirring to my blood...
than any imagining could possibly have been.
HAWKEYE: Top of the next ridge. The fort's downhill of it.
DUNCAN: The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires
and provide every comfort you desire.
I cannot wait to see Papa.
MAN: Fire!
Fire!
What now?
-I'm Major Duncan Heyward. -Captain Jeffrey Beams.
-We didn't expect you to make it through. DUNCAN: Where's Colonel Munro?
Go, boys!
Nathaniel!
It's torture, Jack!
IAN: Uncas! Thought you and Nathaniel weren't joining up.
We didn't. Just dropped in to see how you boys is doing.
Papa! Papa!
Alice! Cora! Why are you here?
And where the hell are my reinforcements?
Get Mr. Phelps.
I told you to stay away.
Why did you disobey me, girls?
When? How? I...
-My letter. -There was none.
MUNRO: What? -There was no letter.
I sent three couriers to Webb.
DUNCAN: One called Magua arrived. CORA: He delivered no such message.
-Does Webb not know we are besieged? -Sir, Webb has no idea.
He certainly does not know to send reinforcements.
-What happened to you? -On the George Road. Attacked.
We're fine.
-Are you all right? -Yes.
What will happen here, Papa?
-We'll be all right, girl. DUNCAN: This Magua led us into it.
Eighteen killed. These men came to our aid. They guided us here.
MUNRO: Thank you.
Do you need anything?
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores?
And some food.
Indebted to you.
PHELPS: Miss Cora, how are you?
Hello, Mr. Phelps.
PHELPS: Mrs. McCann will get dry clothes for you. CORA: Thank you.
Go with your sister, Alice.
It'll be all right, girl.
It'll be all right.
Might I inquire after the situation, sir,
given that I've seen the French engineering from the ridge above?
The situation is, his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them.
They keep our heads down while his troops dig 30 yards of trench a day.
When those trenches are 200 yards from the fort and within range,
he'll bring in his 15-inch mortars, lob explosive rounds over our walls
and pound us to dust.
They look to be 300 yards out.
If they're digging 30 yards a day, you have three days.
Damn. Damn.
A man here can make a run straight through to Webb.
MUNRO: Three days isn't enough to get to Albany and back with reinforcements.
Webb's not in Albany.
He marched the 60th to Fort Edward two days ago.
-Webb is at Edward? -Yes, sir.
That's only 12 miles away.
He could have reinforcements here the day after tomorrow.
You, sir. Pick your man.
Major Heyward will provide a diversion. I'll draft out a dispatch.
Captain Beams will seek you out and give it to you later.
Something else. Cameron's cabin. Frontier cabin. Came upon it yesterday.
It was burnt out, everyone murdered.
It was Ottawa, allied to the French.
Aye.
So?
It was a war party.
That means they're gonna be attacking up and down the frontier.
Thank you, sir.
People here,
-Mohawks, settlers, have family out there. -That'll be all, sir.
Things were done. Nobody was spared.
Those considerations are subordinate to the interests of the Crown.
A terrible feature of war here in the Americas, Major Heyward.
Best keep your eye fixed on our duty, to defeat France.
That hangs on a courier to Webb.
I will give you three oxen for a feast, and tomorrow,
I will sing the war song with you at the Great Council Fire.
Magua?
How are things with your English friends?
MAGUA: The English war chief, Webb, goes to Fort Edward with 60th Regiment.
He does not know that my father's army attacks Fort William Henry.
Magua was successful?
The other two couriers died in the forest.
By now, Munro would know his dispatch did not get through.
He'll send another.
The Grey Hair will try.
BOUGAINVILLE: Four or five, including two women, entered the fort.
The Grey Hair's children were under Magua's knife. They escaped.
They will be under it again.
Why do you hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart.
Before he dies, Magua will put his children under the knife
so the Grey Hair will know his seed is wiped out forever.
PHELPS: Miss Cora?
-Gentleman looking for you. -Miss Munro.
Hello.
May I?
It will seep and then it's going to draw.
UNCAS: Thank you, miss.
About done holding hands with Miss Munro?
We got some work to do.
What are you looking at, sir?
I'm looking at you, miss.
UNCAS: Munro refused to believe what happened.
He does not even want to hear it.
Well, he's gonna have to.
Get together by the west bastion. Ian, Sharitarish, Ongewasgone, and William.
UNCAS: Tight weave.
Silk. Another 40 yards.
MUNRO: And how am I to know it wasn't a raid by common thieves?
HAWKEYE: The cabin was attacked by a war party fighting with the French.
They're sweeping south down the frontier, attacking farms and Mohawk villages.
-All the men are stuck here. -I need proof more convincing
than this man's opinion before I weaken the fort's defenses
by releasing the militia.
Chingachgook's of the same opinion about the raid.
Taken together, that's gospel.
Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb's reinforcements,
-not the presence of the colonials. -I judge military matters here, not you.
Your judgment is not more important than their right under agreement
with Webb to defend their farms and families.
Major Heyward was there. He was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
MUNRO: What exactly did you see, major?
I saw nothing that would lead me to the conclusion it was other than
a raid by savages bent on thievery.
HAWKEYE: You're a liar.
Major!
Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman, not a butcher.
Easy for you to suppose. It's their women and children alone, not yours.
-You forget yourself, sir. -We're not forgetting Webb's promise.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released.
Because I need more definite proof than this man's word.
Nathaniel's word's been good on this frontier long before you got here.
This meeting is over. The militia stays.
Does the rule of English law no longer govern?
Has it been replaced by absolutism?
If English law cannot be trusted,
these people would do better making peace with the French.
That is sedition!
-That is the truth. -I'll have you beaten from this fort.
Someday, you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
Anyone advocating the leaving of Fort William Henry will be hung for sedition.
Anyone actually caught leaving will be shot for desertion.
And my decision is final. Get out.
Cora.
I wanted to talk to you.
ALICE: Talk to Duncan, Cora.
I must manage.
I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl.
-Alice. -I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
Cora, when we come together back in England,
and are married and away from this place,
what had to be done and said here will matter not at all.
-I'm certain of that. -Duncan, I promised you an answer.
You've complimented me with your persistence and patience.
The decision I have come to is that
I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than to surrender my own judgment.
Please take this as my final answer.
It must be no.
I see.
IAN: Yeah, Nathaniel, but you weren't ever for being here.
HAWKEYE: That's right. I saw it that way then and I see it that way now.
Ian, if I had kin in the settlements, hell, I'd be damn sure I'd be long gone.
What do we do about being under Crown law?
I believe if they set aside their law, as and when they wish,
their law no longer has rightful authority over us.
All they have over us then is tyranny.
And I will not live under that yoke. So I will stay here no longer.
Anyone caught leaving could be shot,
so each man make your own decision. Those who are going, be back in an hour.
Out the northern sally-port.
Strike for the east side of the swamp till you clear the French picket line.
Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast.
Fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers.
Should've skinned out of this long ago.
Got no families, captain.
Figured we'd stay and give a hand.
I'll cover you from the top of the bastion.
You're not coming with us?
I got a reason to stay.
That reason wear a striped skirt and work in the surgery?
If it does, no offense,
but it's a better-looking reason than you, Jack Winthrop.
Push hard because you've got to clear the French outpost by dawn.
Good luck, Jack.
Lord have mercy on us.
He was so brave. You should have seen him.
-Ongewasgone, are you staying? -Yes.
There's too many French.
And so few of us to fight. Not too many to die.
But we've given our word to our English fathers.
SERGEANT: You, sir. As you were!
Stand off.
Take him.
[IN MOHICAN] Why do they make my white son prisoner?
[IN MOHICAN] I helped Jack and the others leave...
As you were.
This fight is not yours.
I love you and my brother.
And you should leave this place now...
What will they do to my white son?
CORA: He saved us. We're alive only because of him.
The man encouraged the colonials to desert,
in this very room and in my presence.
-Sir! -He's guilty of sedition.
He must be tried and hanged like any criminal,
regardless of what he did for my children.
But he knew the consequences, and he stayed.
Are those the actions of a criminal?
-Duncan, do something. -He knew the penalty for his actions.
He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
You know he wouldn't send me. You falsely spoke of what you saw.
What happened at the farm was as Nathaniel said.
But not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
And who empowered these colonials to pass judgment on England's policies
in her own possessions, and to come and go without so much as a by-your-leave?
They do not live their lives by your leave!
They hack it out of the wilderness with their own hands,
burying their children along the way.
You're defending him because you've become infatuated with him!
Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable qualities.
Taken as a whole, I was wrong to have thought so highly of you.
MUNRO: Cora!
Cora.
I would do anything I could to keep you from being hurt.
But this man is guilty of sedition
and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
Justice? If that's justice, then the sooner French guns
blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for people here.
MUNRO: You don't know what you're saying! -I know exactly what I'm saying!
And if it's sedition, then I am guilty of sedition too.
They're going to hang you.
Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
Because what I'm interested in is right here.
What can I do?
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.
If they do not arrive, the fort will fall to the French.
If that happens, stay close to your father.
Stay close to him.
The French officers will try to protect the officers among the English.
No. I will find you.
Do not.
Promise me.
The whole world's on fire, isn't it?
CORA: What is it?
Remember what I told you.
Stay close to your father and the officers.
SERGEANT: Company! Left face!
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist.
I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
And I yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your prince.
But now I beg you to listen to the admonishments of humanity.
I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Perhaps the general's glass can reach as far as the Hudson
and seize the size and eminence of the army of Webb.
My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended for you.
Captain de Bougainville.
"To Colonel Munro:
Sir, I regret to inform you that I have no men available
to send to your rescue.
It is quite impossible. I advise you to seek terms for surrender.
I remain, Jerome Webb, at Fort Edward."
This is the signature of Webb. And I know the temper of our men.
Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay,
they'd fight to the end.
You've heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis.
Sir, I beg you not to sign the death warrant of so many until you have listened
to what I have to say.
Go on.
None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They are free,
so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent
and the civilian militia return to their farms.
-Their arms? -They may leave the fortress fully armed.
-My colors? -Carry them to England with pride.
Allow me to consult with my officers.
I have lived to see something which I never expected.
A British officer afraid to support another.
DUNCAN: Webb can burn in hell.
And we'll go back and dig our graves behind those ramparts.
MUNRO: Death and honor are thought to be the same...
but today I have learned that sometimes they are not.
DUNCAN: Sir.
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
Yes.
Not a warrior has a scalp, and the white men become friends.
My master owns these lands, and I have been ordered to drive off
the English squatters.
They have consented to go, so now I call them enemies no longer.
Magua took the hatchet to color with blood. It's still bright.
Only when it's red, then it will be buried.
So many suns have set since Magua struck the war post.
And where is that sun?
Magua is the son of his people, and he has come to lead many of them.
But Magua has power with his Huron people and others here, I know well.
Magua's village and lodges were burnt.
Magua's children were killed by the English.
I was taken as slave by the Mohawk who fought for the Grey Hair.
Magua's wife believed he was dead...
and became the wife of another.
The Grey Hair was the father of all that.
In time, Magua became blood brother to the Mohawk...
to become free.
But always in his heart, he is Huron.
And his heart will be whole again on the day the Grey Hair
and all his seed are dead.
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
Colonel Munro would.
But General Webb will not honor the agreement
and send their soldiers away.
I fear having let them go, which I must,
I will only fight the same men again when I drive towards Albany.
MUNRO: Monsieur, the fort is yours.
SERGEANT: Ready!
Ready, set...
MAN 1: I can't see them.
MAN 2: Let's go!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
MAGUA: Grey Hair.
Before you die, know that I will put under the knife your children,
so I will wipe your seed from the earth forever.
CORA: Leave her alone!
Got nothing better to do on the lake today, major?
When you fall into British hands again, I'll have you hanged!
Faster!
Head for the river!
DUNCAN: Where are we going? HAWKEYE: Nowhere.
DUNCAN: I don't understand. HAWKEYE: This is as far as we go.
If we're lucky, they'll figure we beached our canoes and headed across land.
If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
Our only hope is they pass us by.
If they do?
Take the south rim down the mountain.
It's 12 miles cross-country to Fort Edward.
And if they don't?
You'll just have to forego the pleasure of hanging me.
Powder.
Done.
Mine's soaking wet!
CORA: Our father!
Did you see my father?
From a distance.
Say nothing to Alice.
UNCAS: Get back!
Yes. Go ahead!
What the bloody-hell plan is this?
I want you to go.
If we go, there's a chance there won't be a fight.
There's no powder! If we don't go, then there's no chance! None!
-You understand? -Coward!
You've done everything you can do. Save yourself.
If the worst happens, if only one of us survives,
something of the other does too.
No, you stay alive!
If they don't kill you, they'll take you north up to the Huron lands.
You submit, do you hear? You're strong. You survive!
You stay alive, no matter what occurs!
I will find you.
No matter how long it takes, no matter how far.
I will find you.
[IN HURON] Your tomahawks are red...
[IN HURON] Many of the English are dead, great Sachem.
And Magua has become a great war leader and seeks your acknowledgment.
And so, I have brought three of my prisoners, to honor you.
Magua will sell the English officer to the French.
And the reward is my gift to you, wise one.
The women are the children of the white war chief, Munro.
They will burn in our fires. Then all can share in these trophies of honor.
HAWKEYE: Do you speak French, major? DUNCAN: Yes.
Translate for me into French every word as I say it.
I come to you unarmed and in peace to unstop your ears, Sachem.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free.
Take fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
[IN FRENCH] Montcalm and our friends, the French, are stronger than the English.
We do not fear English anger.
Sachem, the French fathers made peace. Magua broke it.
It is false that the French will be friends still to the Huron.
It made our French father happy to know
that he would never have to fight the same English again.
Now, the French also fear Huron. That is good.
When the Huron is stronger from their fear,
we will make the new terms of trade with the French.
We will become traders as the whites.
Take land from the Abenaki, furs from the Osage, Sauk and Fox.
Take land from the Abenaki, furs from the Osage, Sauk and Fox. Trade for gold.
No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
Would Magua use the ways of Les Français and the Yengeese?
-Would you? -[IN ENGLISH] Yes!
Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy
and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?
Would Huron have greed for more land than a man can use?
Would Huron fool Seneca into taking all the furs of the animals of the forest
for beads and strong whiskey?
Would the Huron kill every man, woman and child of their enemy?
Those are the ways of the Yengeese,
and the Français traders and their masters in Europe
infected with the sickness of greed.
Magua's heart is twisted.
He would make himself into what twisted him.
I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese.
Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook of the Mohican people.
Let the children of the dead Munro and the Yengeese officer go free.
This belt, which is a record of the days of my father's people,
speaks for my truth.
You speak poison with two tongues.
[IN FRENCH] The white man came and night...
entered our future with him.
Our council has asked the question since I was a boy.
What are the Huron to do?
Magua is a great warrior captain, but his path has never been the Huron one.
Magua take younger daughter of Munro,
so that Munro's seed doesn't die and Magua's heart is healed.
English officer will go back to English so their hatred burns less bright.
Dark child of Munro will burn in fire for Magua's dead children.
Long Rifle, go in peace.
Tell him I'll trade him. Me for her!
[IN FRENCH] Take me! A British officer. Me for her.
CORA: Alice!
We will go west to the Huron of the Lakes. This is not the voice of wisdom.
You are women. Slaves. Dogs. I spit on you.
HAWKEYE: Stop him.
I am La Longue Carabine! My death is a great honor to the Huron!
Take me!
Did you tell him?
DUNCAN: Yes.
CORA: Stop.
I said to take me.
-Take me! -My compliments, sir! Take her and get out!
Duncan! What are they doing to Duncan? Where's Alice?
Alice!
Uncas!
[IN ENGLISH] Great Spirit and the Maker of all Life...
a warrior goes to you swift and straight as an arrow shot into the sun.
Welcome him, and let him take his place at the Council Fire of my people.
He is Uncas...
my son.
Tell him to be patient and ask death for speed,
Jesus Christ!
Loomis!
I need you to come with me.
Just a minute.
-Sophie thinks I have a mistress. -Are you worried about that?
If you lived with Sophie, you'd understand.
Sometimes I yearn for our bachelor days in the army.
We were happy then, no? Well, I was happy, but you....
I wonder if you've ever been happy.
Now, it's not Sophie that worries me today.
Then what?
-Who is he? -I thought he was you.
Especially when we couldn't find you.
Then one of my men told me you were at Major Lescourt's funeral.
I thought it was a sick joke. I almost fired him.
ALAIN: But who is he? SEBASTIEN: A good question.
Come on.
We are talking to witnesses.
Apparently, he was being chased...
...and there is evidence he had been recently tortured.
-His death was not an easy one. MAN: Here's the bag, sir.
This was found in the victim's pocket.
These matches are from the Hotel Chevre d'Or.
Our men are there now. -Let's go. -Alain, wait.
-Let's go. -Alain, wait. This is not your case.
I'm not sure I want you involved at this point.
I am involved. Did you see his face?
Are you coming or what?
WOMAN: Monsieur Suverov, thank God!
This man told me you were killed in a car accident.
-Good morning, sir. WOMAN: You only had your hair cut.
-Suverov? -Yes, Mikhail Suverov.
Now, you see. If you want access to his room, why don't you ask M. Suverov?
If you want access to his room, why don't you ask M. Suverov?
Oh, good idea. May we search your room, sir?
But of course.
I trust my map to the street you asked for was satisfactory?
It was, thank you.
-Did I get any messages? -Yes, a telephone message.
Alex Bohemia.
-Did he leave a number? -No, monsieur.
Thank you.
ALAIN: You heard that woman. Suverov must've been looking for me.
A stranger with your exact face...
...and, according to the passport, your exact birth date.
He comes here and asks for directions to the very street where you live.
A mystery, yes?
An airline ticket from Nice to New York.
And a New York driver's license.
Some U.S. cash.
WOMAN: He was born five minutes after you.
I kept both of you for three months.
But I was sick. I couldn't nurse. There wasn't even enough for one of you.
I needed the money. I had to do it.
Tell me now.
-Why did you choose me? -I didn't.
I didn't have the courage. Somebody else did it for me.
Somebody else? A lawyer from Paris.
He picked up your brother because you were crying.
He saw my distress and offered me money.
He said it was a good family.
Oh, God. What have I done?
You survived. Made a home for me.
You did what you had to do. I don't blame you.
-You should've told me. -I know.
Can you remember his name, the lawyer?
Why?
Somebody killed him, Mother.
He was trying to come home and they killed him.
Alain, please....
Can you remember his name?
Etienne St. Denis. He had an office in Place Pigalle in Paris.
WOMAN [OVER P.A.]: Express for Paris is now boarding on platform two.
Parents always lie to their children...
...to prepare them for the way they'll be treated later by the government.
Maybe I'm wasting my time.
But if I don't go now, I'll regret it for the rest of my life.
What do you gain? You'll only open old wounds.
The lawyer can't bring him back.
My brother was adopted.
If I can find his family, I can learn about him.
I can get to know him.
The lawyer's office is on the sixth floor.
Remember, I'll do the talking, okay? And then seafood.
I promise, seafood before we go home.
Get out! Go! Go!
It was the man in the elevator.
WOMAN 2: Help! Please, help!
Help me!
Don't hurt me.
The adoption papers are here. My boss made me hide them.
He would not give them to anybody.
Stay with me. You'll be safe.
-No! -Come on, let's go.
WOMAN 2: Oh, my God.
Let's go.
Come on.
They've checked the entire floor. There's no one in there.
They've checked the entire floor. There's no one in there. No body, nothing.
The secretary said a Russian guy showed up...
...asked her boss a lot of questions.
Got upset with him. He locked her in her room.
Next thing she knew, the place was on fire.
Have you gone through every piece of debris in the office?
-We'll keep looking. -Good.
He was adopted by a Russian family.
The papers show the father was a Soviet diplomat...
...who lived in Paris for five years.
And then emigrated to America in 1968.
-When's the flight? -What flight?
-When's the flight? -What flight? Mikhail's flight to New York. I want his passport.
Mikhail's flight to New York. I want his passport.
No, you're a cop, that's evidence.
You think it was a coincidence that guy was Russian?
Who knows what Mikhail was involved in.
Sebastien, what happened to my brother could've happened to me.
Thirty-two years ago, it was only luck that kept me in France.
He made a sacrifice and never knew it. Hey. I've got to go.
That killer obviously did not know Mikhail is dead.
You go to New York with that face and--
Maybe he isn't.
Would you like a vodka before you sleep, Mr. Suverov?
-No, thank you. -You're welcome.
DRIVER: What you see before you is called gridlock.
Next exit.
I'm writing the great American novel right here on the job.
Literary kind of stuff, you know? Knock the fillings right out of your teeth.
I see everything, you know? That's what it is.
It's all about looking around, observing stuff. You know what I'm saying?
Take you, for instance, you know? Like that accent of yours.
What's that? That's-- Don't tell me. Don't tell me.
That maybe European or something like that?
Yeah, hey, I'll bet you've got a story to tell.
I mean, this is Davis Hartley here, you know?
I'm not some nickel-and-dime street mutt, you know what I'm saying?
I'm not trying to rip you off or anything like that, you know?
It'd be kind of stupid, a guy like you.
Got a couple of pounds of lead in his eyes.
What's that? Is that maybe grief or something like that, hm?
-You wanna talk about it? -No.
Maybe you think I'm just trying to rip off your experiences...
...so that I can put them in my novel, right?
But that's not true, okay?
Davis Hartley is not some moral cretin. You know what I'm saying?
-Not precisely. -Well, I'm trying to make a point here.
I'm a professional New York City cab driver. You know what that means? I'm the greatest individual...
You know what that means? I'm the greatest individual... ...at being able to find anything in the world.
I could find a penguin in a sandstorm.
I don't know what a penguin would be doing in a sandstorm--
Stop talking. Please, stop talking. Hello! Stop talking. You want to help?
After I stop, I'll be busy for a while.
Find a guy named Alex Bohemia.
Who do you think I am? Do you think I'm a magician?
I mean, New York City is a big place.
How the hell am I supposed to find Alex Bohemia?
Kind of like finding a penguin in a sandstorm.
Are you sure you got the right address here?
Where do you boys think this is, Atlantic City?
Jeremy, pick up your milk money and get inside!
Sorry. I'm looking for....
You're in the wrong neighborhood, man.
I'm looking for a family. Maybe you can--
Wack accent. You're way out of your hood, white boy.
You crazy or what?
-Or maybe you a cop. MAN: Hey!
Get the hell out from my building, you little shits!
Come on, old man. He's the chump.
Thank you.
Thanks.
They're not scared of you. They don't know who you are.
They're supposed to be scared? Everybody's supposed to be scared of you.
-Why? -Why?
Oh, please. A bigtime gangster like you. Rich. I thought you'd forgotten about us.
A bigtime gangster like you. Rich. I thought you'd forgotten about us.
I haven't seen you here in a long time.
I'm not who you think I am.
When his family disappeared, there was a lot of rumors.
Some said they had gone back to Russia.
Others said there was trouble with their grocery in Little Odessa.
The Russian mob controls everything in Little Odessa.
Maybe that's why he joined them.
-How old was he? -Sixteen. Forced to live on the street.
You gotta be wild and strong... ...to be a white boy growing up in this neighborhood.
...to be a white boy growing up in this neighborhood.
-Did he ever mention me? -No.
Your brother's. He kept it here all these years.
Was he happy?
Yeah, the last I saw of him. He had matured. Got real serious.
-But he had choices. -What choices? He was alone.
I'd have taken him in. He was a strange boy.
You should go back to France. What you find here could be ugly.
Did he ever mention someone named Alex Bohemia?
No.
But there's a nightclub in Little Odessa called the Bohemia.
Your vodka, Mr. Suverov.
-Excuse me-- -Mr. Suverov, you have a phone call.
Follow me.
Mikhail....
Are you crazy? What the hell are you thinking, coming in here?
Look, the reason the key wasn't in the mailbox...
...is because Darlene didn't show up tonight...
...so I don't get a break for another 20 minutes. Here.
You might as well take it now.
Jesus, you shouldn't have come in here. You should've just gone back and looked for the key later.
You should've just gone back and looked for the key later.
What's the matter? Are you all right?
MAN: Excuse me. -Alex--
You probably gave half those butt-nosed guys up there a heart attack.
I'm surprised we weren't trampled on the way to the phone.
Look, you'd better get out of here.
I'll see you as soon as I get off, all right?
Don't even think about going to sleep. We've got some catching up to do.
Just tell me, is everything gonna be okay?
Get out of here.
Mikhail, you need to go back inside. Ivan wants to talk to you.
We were family. You betrayed us.
Enough, Mikhail.
Enough!
This is your lucky day.
Get in!
That was dynamite.
-Any of those guys Alex Bohemia? -No.
Good. I guess that would've been structural letdown, eh?
-Do you know this place? -Yeah, it's a fleabag hotel.
They say that Bret Easton Ellis, he got drunk, you know...
...and he threw up in a fig tree. The thing won't stop growing.
...and he threw up in a fig tree. The thing won't stop growing. They gotta trim it. They gotta keep trimming it.
They gotta trim it. They gotta keep trimming it.
-Just relax. -He's a very good writer.
-Relax. Just relax. -Okay.
Thanks.
-I'll wait here for you. -Thank you for your help.
Wait, we're not done yet. We gotta find Alex.
My whole first chapter hangs on that.
Go home and use your imagination for chapter one.
Hi. Last time I was here I stayed in room 323.
Kind of a good-luck thing. Is it available?
-No. But I got 305 across the hall. -That's fine.
Sign.
ALEX: Good evening, Mr. Dzasokhov. -You're a very pretty girl, Alex.
ALEX: Good evening, Mr. Dzasokhov. -You're a very pretty girl, Alex. -You know that? -Thank you.
-You know that? -Thank you.
Will you do me a favor? -The band is too loud. -It's a birthday party.
-The band is too loud. -It's a birthday party.
The band is too loud.
Ten minutes, Yuri. Ten minutes.
All I asked was that you hold Mikhail for 10 minutes.
Is that a long time?
No, that is a very short time.
How long can you hold your breath, Yuri?
I knew a fellow in Odessa once... ...who could hold his breath for 5 minutes, 33 seconds.
...who could hold his breath for 5 minutes, 33 seconds.
Did Mikhail talk to anyone while he was here?
Nicholas, please, the man is trying to speak.
He was talking...
...to her.
So, what did you and Mikhail talk about?
I told him he had a phone call.
The caviar is fresh tonight.
Did I tell you what a pretty girl you are?
Let me ask you something, sweetheart.
Do you have any idea what will happen to you if you lie to me?
-I will never lie to you, Mr. Dzasokhov. -Because if you lie to me, pretty girl...
...you won't be pretty anymore.
Get back to work.
What she needs is a good--
ALEX: What are you doing over there?
I've missed you.
Mm. You're so tense. I'll help loosen you up.
What's this?
Are you playing hard to get?
Is this a game?
All right, have it your way.
But no handcuffs this time.
You've gotten a lot harder since you went away.
Ivan was all over me after you left tonight.
He kept asking me stuff.
Did I talk to you? What did I say?
He's like something that crawls out of an old pipe.
It's okay.
In a few days, this will all be behind us.
I can't do it.
I'm not Mikhail. He's dead.
Come here.
Shit.
Look, I am positive the girl went up to 323. -I had the maid-- -The room is empty. I was just up there.
-I had the maid-- -The room is empty. I was just up there.
Now, you saw her come in. When did she leave?
Do you recognize this man?
Yeah! Yeah, he checked in across the hall, room 305.
Room 305. Okay. Good, let's go!
-I found this. -Where did he go?
Where did he go? Tell me!
I want them dead.
Down.
Hold it!
Get in! Get in! Get in!
ALAIN: Go!
Keep moving.
What's wrong? Are you okay?
You were supposed to go home and write.
Who needs home? I'm always working, anyway.
I guess we got chapter one finished.
-Oh, my God. -Is this Alex Bohemia?
That's great. Unexpected development. The whole thing's so scary.
We gotta go. Come on.
Come on.
--Zanzibar Club.
Police are stating that an unidentified man and woman were being pursued....
He was in trouble.
He wouldn't admit it, though.
He always said he had everything under control.
That he had a lot of money put away. Enough for a lifetime.
Said he had a plan that would get him out of the mob.
I guess he was wrong.
They found him.
What did my brother mean to you?
Everything.
Take me to his place. I want to get to know him.
Take you to his place? Are you crazy?
You show up and start this mess that almost gets us killed.
You don't have a clue who you're dealing with, do you?
Look, if you wanna kill yourself, be my guest.
But who gave you the right to risk my life?
I can't go home. I can't go to work.
You've painted a big, red target on my back.
Where's the check?
Hey.
Mikhail used to say we can never stay in one place too long.
We have to move all the time.
It's time for us to move. They'll find us.
The cabby didn't have to die, you know.
This is just the beginning.
I've seen it before. They won't stop until you're dead too.
You can't go to the police. You can't hide.
Ivan and his boss, Kirov, are relentless.
All right, I'll bring you to your brother's home.
MAN: This explains why Mikhail picked a bank in Nice.
It looks like we've got another chance.
How did he manage to hide a twin brother from us?
Sir, Mikhail never communicated with him.
If he had, we'd have known about it.
Well, in less than 56 hours... ...that bank in Nice opens a safe-deposit box...
...and we all read about ourselves in The New York Times.
And if that happens, we'll be spending the rest of our lives...
And if that happens, we'll be spending the rest of our lives... ...wondering how the hell we screwed up so badly.
...wondering how the hell we screwed up so badly.
Remember, Washington doesn't really like federal agents...
...working for the Russian mob.
Our names are on that list.
Get the brother. Convince him to work with us in Nice.
We don't have any options.
We'll get him.
Oh, and guys, keep this one alive. I doubt if they were triplets.
Triplets....
Hey, Alex, what are you doing?
ALEX: Look at this mess.
Hey. Hey.
You know, maybe if you told me what you're looking for... ...I could help you find it.
I wouldn't know what to tell you. I'm just looking.
-What did you find? -He knew about me.
What did you do in the war?
Sniper.
Why wait five years to find me?
MAN: Jimmy! You in there?
Jimmy, open up, you shithead! This stuff's hot.
ALAIN: This is not your lucky day.
Tell your boss to leave me the fuck alone!
Ivan. You look like your parrot died.
-Mikhail's back. -Bring him to me.
How can I bring him in...
...when I've got my hands tied behind my back?
Let me deal with him my own way.
This is not a democracy. You do what I say, understand?
Mikhail has caused no trouble.
If FBI had list, believe me...
...we'd have major war with Italians, with everyone.
If he is here, the list is still in France.
I will convince Mikhail to take proper course of action.
So bring him to me.
I meant no disrespect. I'm just worried.
Remember when you told me about Goradni talking to the FBI?
And Pietro? And Andrea?
I took care of them for you, Dmitri, but Mikhail is different.
I know you feel like he's your son.
Yes, Dimitri.
ALAIN: Is this also Mikhail's place? ALEX: No, my friend's. Mikhail and I used to come here to escape.
ALEX: No, my friend's. Mikhail and I used to come here to escape.
So you looked pretty comfortable...
...with that gun stuck in that guy's neck today.
Although that didn't scare me as much...
...as when you tried to drown him in the Jacuzzi.
I lost it. Sorry.
How long you been working at the Bohemia?
About a year.
I used to dance. Nightclubs.
I make less money now, but it's a little more respectable.
You know, I doubt you'll find anything here of your brother's.
It's worth trying.
What did he do to make all these people want to kill him?
Mikhail talked about some insurance policy... ...or something that would keep him alive.
The FBI was following him, pressuring him to turn evidence on Kirov.
You think those aren't enough reasons to kill him?
The only time my brother and I connected...
...was when he died.
We both lost something.
PELLMAN: Rise and shine, boys and girls.
Special Agent Pellman, Loomis. FBI.
How are you?
Alex Bartlett and Alain Moreau.
I believe we share mutual concerns.
Now, we know you're not Mikhail. We know you're not, you know, part of the Russian mob.
We know you're not, you know, part of the Russian mob.
That's a first. What do you want?
We want to nail the guys that are trying to kill you.
And? Well, Mikhail kept a list. A detailed list.
Well, Mikhail kept a list. A detailed list.
People, places, events.
Pretty much outlines the entire Russian mob operation.
Mikhail was working with us.
He was helping us with our investigation of the Russian mob.
Fact is, your brother wanted to set things right.
Fact is, your brother wanted to set things right. He wanted to set things straight. He wanted to help us.
He wanted to set things straight. He wanted to help us. He was going to give us the list before he was killed.
He was going to give us the list before he was killed.
The list is in a safe-deposit box in a bank in Nice.
What we want you to do... ...is we want you to come with us to the bank, to Nice...
...is we want you to come with us to the bank, to Nice... ...and pretend....
That I'm Mikhail. Exactly. Exactly. We knew you'd wanna help.
Exactly. Exactly. We knew you'd wanna help.
But I don't.
Can you protect her from being killed?
Can you protect me? You sure didn't protect my brother.
Hey, pal, we're your only hope.
I'll take my chances.
Why don't we try another approach, okay? Come here.
I don't understand what's happening. They're the FBI.
I don't understand what's happening. They're the FBI. -They're supposed to help us. -At gunpoint it's not called help.
-They're supposed to help us. -At gunpoint it's not called help.
Nothing makes sense. Who isn't trying to kill us at this point?
When the FBI told you Mikhail was working with them...
...you didn't believe them, did you?
No way. He would've told me. I know he would've.
So they lied. They knew my brother was dead.
The Russians didn't know about it. The Russians were pissed at me...
...but not surprised to see me alive.
So if the Russians didn't kill him.... Follow the list. Who else cares about it?
-The FBI. -The FBI, yeah.
-Where are you going? -To see Kirov.
You can't leave me here. I'm coming with you.
It's too dangerous.
Can't believe this is happening again. First Mikhail, and now you?
Alain, you've gotta let me come with you. We're in this together, right?
Alex, I promise you I'll come back for you.
I promise.
Take me to Kirov.
Now.
Sit down.
Kirov asked me to bring him in.
I'm so sorry, Kirov.
Don't do it.
Back off!
I came to talk to Kirov.
Mikhail?
-No, you're not Mikhail. Who are you? -I'm his brother.
-If you are brother, where is Mikhail? -He's dead.
-I see I got your attention. -How did he die?
-I see I got your attention. -How did he die? -You tell me. -I had nothing to do with his death.
-You tell me. -I had nothing to do with his death. You don't need your gun. You're safe here.
You don't need your gun. You're safe here. Your people tried to kill me. They thought I was Mikhail.
Your people tried to kill me. They thought I was Mikhail. Impossible. I wanted to speak to him, not kill him.
Impossible. I wanted to speak to him, not kill him.
To speak? In what language?
They tried to kill me and almost succeeded.
-Dimitri-- -Get out.
-I just wanted-- -Get out!
Go look after Ivan.
Mikhail....
I'm sorry. What is your name?
-Alain. -Alain. Come. We need to talk.
Ivan and Mikhail, they were like sons to me.
I need a favor.
I want to go back to Nice.
Back home.
Yes, I can help you.
Mikhail had a list in a bank in Nice.
Get it for me. We help each other.
Go.
MAN: Call an ambulance.
The other side! Get him!
-Don't move! -Okay, Peter Pan.
Get in the car.
Did you know I had a contract out on him?
If you weren't protecting him, he would be dead in his cell right now.
The problem with you, Ivan, is you don't think. You kill.
You're not Kirov. What did you say?
-We need him to get the list, Ivan. -Why would he get you the list?
-We need him to get the list, Ivan. -Why would he get you the list? Because you're gonna help us make sure he understands what happens
Because you're gonna help us make sure he understands what happens if he's not a good boy in Nice.
if he's not a good boy in Nice.
And after?
We have 24 hours left. Work with us on this, and he's all yours. I don't care what you do with him.
Work with us on this, and he's all yours. I don't care what you do with him.
Ivan, listen, we know you have an alibi for Kirov's death...
Ivan, listen, we know you have an alibi for Kirov's death... ...but we also know that you had him killed.
...but we also know that you had him killed.
So after this, let's start fresh. No more trouble around here. Is that okay with you?
Listen to me. I'm running things now. My way.
That girl knows too much. She's mine now.
You have visitors.
So I'm hoping a good night's sleep is all you needed to see the light.
You win.
In a few hours we go banking. So try and get some rest.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't worry about it, Loomis. I checked it out. Everything's copacetic.
So, what's the plan?
We've got to get out of here.
No plan.
Nothing.
Alain, about tomorrow....
Tomorrow I really find out who my brother was.
They're not gonna let us go, even when they get the list.
Monsieur Suverov, welcome again.
If there is anything I can do for you, do not hesitate to make a request.
-We'd just like to go right in, if that's okay. -I'm sorry. Only Mr. Suverov.
The vault is for customers only.
PELLMAN: Sir, my colleague and I-- -I'm sorry, sir, bank policy.
Please, Monsieur Suverov, come with me.
Please make yourself comfortable and stay as long as you desire.
Unfortunately we must go through the identity protocol again.
Yeah, okay.
-Please, identify yourself. -Mikhail Suverov.
-And the second name? -Um, Alain Moreau.
-Your mother's Christian given name. -Chantal Moreau.
Clean and quiet.
Here, monsieur.
-Do you smoke? -No, sir, I don't.
-Can I get a cigarette? -Of course, monsieur.
-And some gum. Thank you. -Certainly.
-I need access to my security box. -May I see your ID?
This is the one under the name Alain Moreau.
MIKHAIL [ON RECORDING]: Only you could access this box...
...therefore one of two things has happened:
We are together again, as we should have been, a family...
...or I am dead, and you shouldn't trust anyone.
I know you are a great marksman, therefore I'm leaving you a gift.
I know you are a great marksman, therefore I'm leaving you a gift. Your favorite.
One of the boxes contains evidence against government agents...
...and the Russian mob.
Hand it over to the American Embassy.
Alain, when I found out about you, it was luck. A newspaper.
The moment I saw the picture, I knew I had a brother in this world.
You, my brother, reminded me that I had a chance...
...and I decided to quit the mob.
I didn't contact you...
...because everything I touched in my world turned to poison.
I've tried all these years to leave my life behind. To reunite us.
I'm sorry if that never happens. Please forgive me.
I want you to tell our mother that I don't blame her for what she did.
The life I've lived has taught me this.
I only hope that we are listening to this tape together.
The money is for you and our mother.
You are my only friend. God bless.
Have everything in the small box turned over to the American Embassy.
-You understand? -Perfectly, sir.
Sit down. Just sit.
Get the fuck out of here!
-We're clearing the building. -We can't leave without our guy.
You can meet him outside. Everyone is being cleared to the street.
ALAIN: Don't shoot. I'm a cop. MAN: We'll see about that.
Let's go, come on.
Sorry, sir.
Let's go.
MAN: Put your hands where we can see them and step out of the van.
Keep your hands where we can see them and step out of the van.
Back it up!
Get out!
If you move, you die.
Sebastien!
Sebastien. Come on.
Me first. Get me out!
Take a number.
Don't leave me, please. I beg you.
Help me!
-Are you okay? -Yeah, thank you.
The two men, they took the girl with them.
That way.
-Don't shoot. -Where did they go?
Down there.
I need the car. Sorry.
He's coming up.
PELLMAN: Shut up!
Try that again and you're dead! You hear me?
Come on.
Come on.
Alain!
I want you to listen to me now. I know you don't have the list.
But that doesn't matter now, see?
Because I want the money.
I know you have Mikhail's money and I want it.
Why don't you give it to me? Then you walk.
Do we have a deal?
Do we have a deal? I don't think you get it, pal! I will kill her! Do you understand me?
I don't think you get it, pal! I will kill her! Do you understand me?
The Americans are ecstatic over Mikhail's evidence.
They've made dozens of arrests.
And thanks to his money, you can afford to eat here.
Hello, Alain? Are you nervous, Alex meeting your mother?
I'm not nervous.
Okay, I'm nervous.
Well, it's too late now.
Wish me luck, okay?
Do you feel okay? Because it's no reason to be nervous.
-I'm not nervous. -Good.
You know, let's take a walk. It's nearby.
It's relaxing.
Okay, good. Because I think one of us needs to relax.
Do you know what you will say?
I'm not asking you to lie.
I don't need to lie, Alain.
I'll tell your mother the truth about Mikhail.
That he was kind and generous.
Honest.
Excuse me.
-Nervous? -No.
-I hate flying. -It's something I ate.
Maybe you're just excited about getting home.
-No, I think it's the baklavas. -Told you not to eat them.
-I've got to go to the john again. -I'll wait.
-No, I'll catch up to you. Okay? -Okay.
Passport.
Basket.
It's a frisbee.
You throw it and catch it. It's a game.
A game.
-Are you okay? -Yeah, great. Want a piece of gum?
Thank you.
See this? Janis Joplin died yesterday.
Overdose. There never was anyone like Janis.
There never was anyone like you.
Knock it off.
-You never take anything seriously. -Nothing.
-What's he saying? -I don't know.
They always have everything ass backwards in Turkey.
-Billy, what's the matter? -Passport. Susan, get on the plane.
What is it Billy? What's wrong, are you sick?
Get on the plane. Go.
I'm looking for my passport.
Harry, you'd better get rid of those grenades.
Get down.
-Name? -William Hayes.
-William... -Hayes.
Hayes.
-American? -That's right.
Yes, American. United States.
American.
-Name? -Jesus...William Hayes.
-Name? -Hayes. H-A-Y-E-S.
Howdy, Billy. How are you doing? Okay?
I think these gentlemen have finished for the time being.
If you'd like to put your clothes on.
The officer wants to know if you're afraid.
No, I'm not afraid.
The officer said there's nothing to be afraid of.
Cooperate, and you'll be on the plane home.
Where did you get the hashish?
From a cab driver.
In the playing shop at the bazaar.
Would you recognize him again?
I think so.
You decided to fly at a bad time.
Guerrillas all over the place, blowing up planes and all.
Stupid.
Four planes in four days. Don't you read the newspapers?
There's been a shit storm over the flow of heroin from Turkey.
-I didn't have heroin. -A drug is a drug.
It was my first time. It was only two kilos.
It doesn't matter if it was two or 200 kilos.
Catching you shows the world Turkey is fighting the drug trade.
-Are you with the Consulate? -Something like that. Cigarette?
-What did you pay this cab driver? -$200. My last 200.
-How much did you figure to make? -I'd only sell it to my friends.
-I'm not a pusher. Honest. -It beats working.
-Have you got a family? -Mother, father, brother, sister.
-Long Island. -It'll be tough on them.
-Girlfriend? -Yeah, she was on the plane.
She didn't know anything about it. I didn't want her to.
Lucky girl.
-She used to say I was lucky. -Let's hope so, Billy.
You seem like a nice enough kid.
But you try it, and I'll blow your brains out.
Mom and Dad, this is the hardest letter I've ever had to write.
I hoped to get out of this quickly, so you'd never know about it.
But that just isn't possible now. I don't know what's going to happen.
What can I say to you? Will "I'm sorry" make a difference?
Will it ease the pain, the shame you must be feeling?
Forgive me, please.
Could I have a blanket?
It's cold. Could I have a blanket?
-A blanket! -Too late. Tomorrow.
He'll be here tomorrow, I think.
Goodnight.
-Can you speak English? -Your cell is open.
Blankets, three cells down. You get me one.
I needed a blanket. I was cold.
William Hayes.
I needed a blanket, I was cold!
Jesus....
Come on, you must stand.
You'd better walk around, or your feet will swell up.
You've got to be crazy.
We all are. Smoke some of this, cool the pain.
You've been out for days, talking all kinds of shit.
We'll walk you down to the courtyard.
-How does it feel? -About as good as it looks.
Gecmis olsun. It's Turkish. It means, "May it pass quickly."
-It looks like a cheap hotel. -The room service is lousy.
I'm Jimmy Booth. This is Erich, something Swedish.
-Just Erich. -He cleaned you up.
Thanks. I'm Billy Hayes.
At least I used to be.
-Why peacocks? -The Turks use them instead of dogs.
They scream like mad if they're disturbed and they don't get rabies.
The old sultans used to use them to guard their harem.
Who are the kids?
Little fuckers. Thieves, rapists, murderers.... You name it, they do it.
Don't trust any of them. They tell Rifki everything.
He's the squeal around here. He sells tea...
He's the squeal around here. He sells tea... ...hash, blankets, anything for a buck.
...hash, blankets, anything for a buck.
-What are you in for, hash? -Yeah.
-Where? -At the airport, trying to get home.
That's heavy.
-You think so? -Yeah, I think so.
This ain't the good old USA.
In Turkey, it's a fucking accident if you're innocent.
-Nobody here is innocent. -Don't pay too much attention.
Anything is possible in Turkey.
He's talking about if they hit you for smuggling, it can be bad.
If they make it possession, you might even get bail.
If you make bail, you're free. Sneak across the border to Greece.
Sure, keep dreaming. See where it gets you. Like Max.
It's going to be a while before you taste a hamburger again.
You broke the law, and you got caught.
The law is sometimes wrong.
The law is never wrong, asshole.
The fucking law is.
People get on his nerves.
What's he in for?
Caught stealing from a mosque, that's heavy here.
-What did he steal? -Two candlesticks.
-That's all? -Jimmy has more balls than brains.
He was in for a year and a half before he even told his parents.
-What about you? -Hashish, like most foreigners.
-What did they give you? -12 years.
-How much you have? -I had 100 grams.
You've got to get a good lawyer. Talk to the Englishman. Max.
He's been in the longest. -How long? -Seven years.
-How long? -Seven years.
Gastro.
Stomach medicine.
It's got codeine in it. It's the best I can do around here.
Max?
Lawyers...?
Oh, yeah.
There's no straight lawyers in Turkey.
They're all bent.
Bent as hairpins. Occupational necessity.
They have special classes in corruption at night school.
If you're suspected of honesty, you're disbarred.
I knew a lawyer fellow once.
He got that Frenchman off. La Roche.
A big smuggler.
200 kilos.
He put enough bread in enough pockets. Got bail.
Vanished.
His name?
Who? The lawyer.
Lawyer?
Who got the Frenchman off.
Yesil is his name.
I don't know anything else about him.
Yesil.
The best thing to do is get your ass out of here.
Best way you can.
-Yeah, but how? -Catch the midnight express.
What's that?
It's not a train.
It's a prison word for...
...escape.
It doesn't stop around here.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Forget it.
I'll punch you in the nose later.
We've got to get you out of here.
This is a suit I brought for you.
Smarten you up a little.
-Are you all right? -Yeah.
How's Mom?
Well, she's bad.
She couldn't make the trip. You know Mom. Her boy....
Susan told us before we got your letter.
She's saving to come back here.
Don't let her come.
How's Rob? How's Peg?
They're the same. You know.
We told the neighbors you were in a hospital in Europe.
This is Stanley Daniels. He's the American Consul here.
Hello, Billy, nice to know you.
I want you to know we're gonna do everything in our power...
...to get you out of here.
That's Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you asked for.
I know exactly what you feel, but you must not worry.
We'll get the right court and the right judge.
I'll arrange everything, just right.
I understand that if you get bail, it's easy to get across the border.
That's what we're shooting for. I've spoken to the State Department.
That's what we're shooting for. I've spoken to the State Department. Right now, relations with the Turks aren't too good. Nixon upset them.
Right now, relations with the Turks aren't too good. Nixon upset them.
Our best bet is right here.
Dad, I'll pay you back for this. I promise.
Money doesn't matter, Billy. Not at this stage.
Where did you get that limp?
Nothing, I just twisted my ankle.
Where are you staying?
The Hilton.
How do you like Istanbul?
Interesting place.
The food is lousy. The crap they sell in the restaurants....
I had to run to the toilet. You should have seen the toilet.
I'm not taking any more chances.
I'll eat at the Hilton every night. Steak, french fries and ketchup.
Billy....
Why did you do it?
Money.
I know you kids smoke that stuff and we drink booze...
...but taking it across the border, that's stupid.
...but taking it across the border, that's stupid. I know.
Dad.
Get me out of here.
I promise you. Just sit tight.
Let me work with Mr. Daniels and Mr. Yesil here.
We'll get you out, okay?
Hey, Billy.
Okay?
Okay.
-What did that prosecutor say? -It's not important.
Just technical.
We made our case. You spoke well. The judge liked you.
Mr. Hayes, the judge is coming back.
-Four years, two months. -Four years?
We'll appeal, you will see.
It'll be reduced for good behavior. It is only for possession.
The prosecutor wanted a life sentence for smuggling.
That is quite a difference, believe me.
To be honest, Mr. Hayes, it is a great victory.
With good time, it works out to about...
...three years.
And then there's the appeal.
Daniels and Yesil are all working for you.
We're trying to get you transferred to a State-side prison.
Daniels thinks there might be a political amnesty any month now.
All right, Billy.
I know it sounds tough...
...but we are going to get you out.
I promise you. Don't do anything stupid.
They could play with your sentence.
All right, now....
I'm putting $500 in the bank. Anything you need...
...you write.
There's food here, candy, writing paper...
...books, cigarettes, soap, toothbrush.
I've sold insurance for 30 years.
Now I've got to see my own son....
Jesus.
If I could be where you are...
...I'd be there.
I love you, Dad.
You take good care of my boy, or I'll have your fucking head!
Dear Susan, 1970 has now passed into 1971.
You can drift in here and never know you're gone.
You can fade so far out, you don't know where you are anymore...
...or where anything else is.
I find loneliness is a physical pain that hurts all over.
You can't isolate it in one part of your body.
You know. Right there. Right there.
To the Turks everything is "söyle böyle."
It means "like this, like that." You never know what will happen.
All foreigners are "ayip." They're considered dirty.
So is homosexuality. That's a big crime here.
But most of them do it every chance they get.
There are about 1000 things that are "ayip."
There are about 1000 things that are "ayip." You can stab or shoot somebody below the waist but not above.
You can stab or shoot somebody below the waist but not above.
Because that's intent to kill.
So everybody runs around stabbing everyone else in the ass.
That's what they call "Turkish revenge."
I know it must sound crazy to you, but this place is crazy.
One day, one of the new kids was raped.
So they picked out four of the worst kids.
Then there's Rifki. The more I know of him, the more I hate him.
$10 for this shit? You pig.
There are no pigs in Turkey.
-This shit is shit. -No, it's good. Good shit.
-You big shit. -Yeah, me big shit.
You asshole.
What is it with you? Just what the hell is it, man?
You don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you.
You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.
-You rip us off on the hash. -I make special tea for you.
We have to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Shove it, Rifki. For all the money you've got, you've got nothing.
-You are American, you don't know. -Know what?
Dog eat dog.
You fuck other man before he fucks you. And you must fuck last.
Come on down. Come on.
Egbert.
Sodding cat.
William!
Are you all right?
The new American Ambassador is following your case.
He says there is progress. You want a cigarette?
But there is another route...
...that is quite possible.
For a proper amount of money, it is possible...
...to convince the ten officials to lose track of your papers...
...before the High Court in Ankara confirms the sentence...
...before the High Court in Ankara confirms the sentence... ...of a lower court in Istanbul. You would not exist.
...of a lower court in Istanbul. You would not exist.
And you could be in Greece by the time the Turkish court...
...discover their stupid clerical mistake.
But I have to act before the official sentence is handed down.
And for that I must pay certain officials.
What's that?
-The blueprints. -To what?
To the prison, man.
There was this German architect in the hospital.
He was helping the Turks build some shit around the place.
I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
It's too bad you didn't have a Xerox machine.
There are two ways out of here.
One is over the roof, but that's kind of risky.
Maybe one person. Two at the most.
The other way, I'll need your help, and that is under.
A tunnel?
-Are you serious? -This is not Stalag 17.
That's where you're wrong. The tunnel is already built.
There's a basement where they used to keep weapons.
Beneath that are the catacombs the Christians built to bury their dead.
We're sitting right on top of it here.
The kraut says that there's a bunch of hollow shafts.
They're like dumbwaiters, all along these walls.
One of them is right next to our shower.
If we get in there, we can get down into the catacombs.
With three of us working, it shouldn't take too long.
Must be around here someplace.
I swear I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
-You stop shitting me, man. Okay? -How do we get into the shaft?
We knock three times and say we're a friend of the deceased.
I'm getting this together and I don't need no gastro-head along.
You understand me?
-We go through the wall. -We go through the wall?
Go through the wall.
The kraut was right. I checked it out.
There's no reinforced steel in those shower walls.
It's real soft from underground seepage.
The water like weeps through the cement.
Twenty, thirty years. You can almost push it over.
All we have to do....
We only have to use your screwdriver to scrape the mortar out.
We pull out three stones and squeeze through....
Squeeze through, put them back, and get our ass down the shaft.
-It's a two-night operation. -What do we do in the catacombs?
What do you want, a door?
There's miles of them down there. Like a sewer system.
-You must be fucking crazy. -They've got to come up someplace.
You've had your ass stopped just one too many times.
You won't find any catacombs, you'll just finish up in section 13.
Billy. The tunnel or the roof?
Forget the wall. Rifki's always there.
Forget the wall. Rifki's always there. -The roof is guarded. -Help me get into the shaft.
-The roof is guarded. -Help me get into the shaft.
If we get caught, I'll get the shaft.
Now I'm facing another 20 months.
I'll be back up to three years again, maybe more.
Fuck it, then. You choose your own death.
I'll do this thing on my own. I'm taking the roof out of here.
No! I can't take it!
Dear Susan, Jimmy was caught and beaten badly.
He got a severe hernia and lost a testicle.
He's been in the sanatorium for months.
In comparison, my problems seem small.
But two and a half years have gone by.
The Turks are slowly draining my life away.
-Why do you keep your hair short? -To remind me.
-Remind you of what? -How much I hate it here.
Prison, monastery, cloister, cave.
Prison, monastery, cloister, cave.
Prison, monastery, cloister, cave.
Prison, monastery, cloister, cave.
Prison....
-Okay. -I've been thinking about another way.
-Another way what? -Out of here.
-Another way what? -Out of here. Oh, yeah?
When I was in the sanatorium, there was only one guard on my ward.
-I could have got out of there. -Why didn't you?
As soon as I could walk, they threw me back in here.
-Lucky you. -I tell you, Billy....
Another ward in the sanatorium had no guard on it at all.
-Who was in it? -Three guys.
-What was wrong with them? -I don't know.
-I think they were dead. -It figures.
I've got to go. It's Daniels! Turkish justice has done it again.
They're going to let me off my last 53 days. Jimmy, I'm going home!
God! "I've got to go."
What's wrong?
Sit down, Billy.
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
-Is it Dad? Mom? -No.
-You're going to have a new court. -What do you mean?
The prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession.
He wanted a smuggling conviction. The Ankara court reviewed it.
It seems everyone wanted an example made. A scapegoat.
And?
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence.
There were 35 judges in the court.
28 voted for a life sentence.
The lower court in Istanbul had to go along with the decision.
The judge likes you. He notified your dad.
What do you mean, life?
-Life for what? -Billy!
I have 53 days left! I have 53 days left! I have 53 days left!
You goddamn bastard! I have 53 days-- Let me go!
So now it's time for me to speak.
What is there for me to say?
When I finish, you'll sentence me for my crime.
So let me ask you now:
What is a crime?
What is a punishment?
It seems to vary from time to time and place to place.
What's legal today is suddenly illegal tomorrow...
...because some society says it's so.
What's illegal is suddenly legal because everybody's doing it.
You can't put everybody in jail.
I'm not saying this is right or wrong.
I'm just saying that's the way it is.
I've spent three and a half years of my life in your prison.
I think I've paid for my error.
If it's your decision today to sentence me to more years....
My lawyer-- That's a good one. He says, "Be cool, Billy.
Don't get angry. Don't get upset. Be good. I'll get you a pardon, an amnesty, an appeal."
Be good. I'll get you a pardon, an amnesty, an appeal."
This has been going on now for three and a half years.
I've been playing it cool. I've been good.
Now I'm damn tired of being good.
Because you people gave me the belief that I had 53 days left.
You hung 53 days in my face, and then you took them away.
And you!
I wish you could be standing where I'm standing right now.
Then you would know something that you don't know.
Mercy!
You would know that the concept of a society...
...is based on the quality of that mercy.
Its sense of fair play and justice.
But I guess that's like asking a bear to shit in a toilet.
For a nation of pigs, it sure is funny you don't eat them.
Jesus Christ forgave the bastards, but I can't.
I hate.
I hate you.
I hate your nation and I hate your people.
I fuck your sons and daughters because they're pigs.
You're a pig.
You're all pigs.
My hands are tied by Ankara.
I must sentence you, William Hayes, to be imprisoned...
...for a term no less than 30 years.
May it pass quickly.
Got the old Istanbul blues
Got the old Istanbul blues Istanbul blues
They give me 30 years
Ain't got nothing left to lose
We are going to get you out. I promise you.
Don't do anything stupid. They could play with your sentence.
I was busted at the border
The best thing to do is get your ass out of here.
The best way you can.
Hey, I think I found it. Come here.
Listen to that. Do you hear anything?
I told you, you suckers. You didn't believe me.
Keep it down. Keep it down. Keep it down.
Look how soft this is. It'll be easy.
Go and get Rifki's poker, but don't wake him up.
Go on. Go on! Look how soft it is.
It's really soft. It's coming.
-Jimmy, it's coming. -Here, use this.
It's coming real easy. It's coming right out.
It's easier than I thought. It's a piece of cake.
It's coming.
Like butter.
Hey, Max. Rifki.
-Keep checking for Rifki. -It's okay.
-Watch it. -I thought you wanted out of here.
-They're loose. -Let's try.
-You wanna split your hernia again. -Fuck that. Let's just get this.
-Okay? You got it? -Yeah.
-That's it. -You see it?
It's the shaft.
It's coming.
It's okay.
-Let's go, Billy. -It's too late. We're not prepared.
-We'll go tomorrow. It's too late. -Let's go now.
It's too late. We'll go tomorrow.
Let's put them back. Help me.
Any fuck-ups and we should be back by dawn.
You got everything?
Maps, railroad, bus timetables.
Okay, let's do it.
-Can you see? -No.
Come on, Max, get your ass down here.
It's easy.
This way to Istanbul, baby.
Watch it. Mind how you go there.
Are you all right? Come down this pole and cross over.
Terrific.
-All right, it's a tunnel. -Let's go.
Come on, Max.
Fuck! What is that? Shit!
Shit! It's a dead end.
The Turks must have blocked it up.
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Billy!
What the fuck are we going to do? What time is it?
4:30.
-Go back. -You must be fucking joking.
We go back, seal it up, and come back tomorrow.
Every night, until we get out.
There's got to be a way out.
Billy, they found it.
-Who? -Rifki.
No do, no do.
No! No! No!
Filthy little bastard.
This time I'm going to kick your brains all over your fucking kitchen.
Fine! Good. Man to man.
When we're finished, I'll bring Hamidou and he'll kick your ass.
Let's go, Max. Come on.
-I know what I'm going to do. -What?
-I'm going to cut his throat. -Whose?
Rifki.
What have I got to lose?
Anyway, I'd really enjoy it.
Why don't you sit down? You're in no shape to kill anybody.
-I want to cut his fucking throat. -It's already been cut.
Then I'll cut his balls off.
You know, if you really wanted to hurt Rifki....
His money. Steal that and you steal his life's blood.
Could you see his face if everything he had got snatched?
-If we only knew where he hid it. -I know where it is.
Max....
The money?
Them that hides can find, says I.
I've seen him, the big tit.
He looks at it, late at night.
Talking to it.
Where?
Max, where?
The money, where?
In his radio.
In the back of his radio.
That's why he never plays it.
-He never had one. -Soon he's back on the street.
No friends, no money, plenty of enemies.
-I'll drink to that. -Me, too.
-I've just got some news on Jimmy. -Really? What?
They sent him to the hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
-Shit! -I guess he didn't talk.
Look at Rifki, wearing a suit.
Maybe he's got a new job.
Jesus! Not again.
Hashish.
You're kidding! Me?
I didn't sell him anything.
Rifki's lying. He's a liar!
Rifki!
Please, listen to me.
Excuse me, I've been wanting to speak to you. You're an American?
Yes, America. My name is Ahmet.
I studied philosophy at Harvard many, many years...
...though Oxford is my real alma mater.
I also studied in Vienna, and now I study here.
They put me here. They say I raped a little child.
I've been here a very, very long time. They'll never let me go. They won't let you go, either.
They'll never let me go. They won't let you go, either. They tell you they'll let you go, but in fact you stay.
They tell you they'll let you go, but in fact you stay.
You'll never go from here.
You see, we all of us come from a factory.
Sometimes the factory makes bad machines that don't work.
The bad machines don't know they're bad machines.
But the people at the factory know.
They know that you are one of the machines that doesn't work.
I think we've spoken enough for today.
I wish you goodnight.
My God!
Billy!
What have they done to you?
Your family is fine.
Senator Buckley has made a special plea on your behalf.
They've called you a pawn in the game between Nixon and the Turks.
The letters are coming in. People do care.
What?
Take it off.
-You'll just make yourself-- -Take it off.
Billy....
I wish I could make it better for you. Please, don't.
Don't.
-Susan. -Yes, Billy.
-I love you. -Oh, Billy.
I love you.
Your father gave me this for you.
There's pictures of your mom and dad, and Rob and Peg.
And in the back there's a picture of your old friend Mr. Franklin.
Remember him? From the bank.
He's over in Greece now. He bought a ticket.
I'll give it to them for you.
Don't count on them. Don't count on anyone but yourself.
You're running out of time. If you stay here, you'll die.
You've got to get yourself together. You've got to get out of here.
Good morning, my American friend.
There will be trouble if you go this way.
A good Turk always walks to the right.
Left is Communist. Right is good.
You must go the other way.
The other way is good.
Where are you going? Why don't you walk the wheel?
What is the matter, my American friend?
What has upset you?
A bad machine doesn't know he's bad machine.
You still don't believe you're a bad machine?
To know yourself is to know God.
The factory knows, that's why they put you here.
You'll find out.
-In time you'll know. -I already know.
You are a bad machine, that's why the factory keeps you here.
Do you know how I know?
I know because I'm from the factory.
I make the machines.
Max.
Max!
Max!
I'm going away.
I've come to say goodbye.
You see, if I stay here, I'm going to die.
You'll die. Don't die, Max.
Please, don't die.
I'm going to come back for you.
You hang on for me.

THE SAME DETERMINATION YOU SHOWED UP IN BAKERSFIELD.
WELL, FIRST, I'VE GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU.
WE ALL KNOW YOU'RE A TOUGH GUY, BEN,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE A LONER.
IT TAKES A BIG MAN TO ADMIT HE NEEDS FRIENDS.
WE DIDN'T WANT TO BREAK UP A WINNING TEAM,
SO HERE THEY ARE, RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BEN'S BUDDIES,
HAROLD WEISS AND WILLIAM LAUGHLIN.
SON OF A BITCH!
YOU KNOW HOW THIS WORKS.
THE GAME ZONE IS DIVIDED INTO 400 SQUARE BLOCKS
LEFT OVER FROM THE BIG QUAKE OF '97.
WE WILL NEVER FORGET THAT.
ONCE INSIDE THE ZONE, RUNNERS HAVE THREE HOURS TO GO THROUGH ALL FOUR GAME QUADS.
RUNNERS HAVE THREE HOURS TO GO THROUGH ALL FOUR GAME QUADS.
THREE HOURS OR LESS AND THEY'LL NEED EVERY SECOND

DYNAMO, 3 TO 1.
TIME'S UP.
NO MORE BETS. BACK OFF! COME ON!
THEY'RE ALL SO GOOD. QUICKLY!
MY HUSBAND AND SON HAVE THEIR FAVORITES, BUT I LIKE MY MEN BIG AND CUDDLY.

A CADRE TROPHY CHAMPION WITH OVER 3O LIFETIME KILLS,
LET'S WELCOME THE INCREDIBLE ICEMAN, WHO SLICES HIS ENEMIES LIMB FROM LIMB
INTO QUIVERING BLOODY SUSHI, PROFESSOR SUBZERO!
LET'S GO!
COME ON! LET'S GO!
DAVID, HERE IN THE LOCKER ROOM,
THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT, A LOT OF ADRENALINE.
THE STALKERS KNOW THERE'S 400 SQUARE BLOCKS OF GAME ZONE,
AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE NEXT THREE HOURS.
I REMEMBER ONCE-- SORRY, CAP. I'VE JUST BEEN INFORMED
SORRY, CAP. I'VE JUST BEEN INFORMED THE RUNNERS HAVE ENTERED THE FIRST QUAD.
LET'S GO THERE, LIVE!
FASTER! FASTER! KEEP GOING!

WILL, LOOK OUT!
KILL THAT SON OF A BITCH!
COME ON! YEAH! YEAH!
HEY, KILLIAN!
HERE IS SUBZERO--
NOW PLAIN ZERO.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS JUST HORRIBLE.
WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS WHAT WE'RE ALL FEELING AT THIS VERY MOMENT.
A GREAT CHAMPION HAS FALLEN.
WE'LL BE BACK RIGHT AFTER THESE IMPORTANT MESSAGES.
PULL!
YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. BOY.
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT?
IT'S GAS.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
SURE GLAD WE TOOK CARE OF SUBZERO.
YEAH, HE WAS A REAL PAIN IN THE NECK.
I KNOW A STALKER DIED.
WELL, IT HAD TO HAPPEN SOONER OR LATER.
YEAH, WELL, IT IS A CONTACT SPORT, RIGHT?
YES, YOU GUYS AT JUSTICE, YOU CANNOT HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.
YOU WANT RATINGS, YOU WANT PEOPLE IN FRONT OF THE TV SETS
INSTEAD OF PICKET LINES--
WELL, YOU AIN'T GONNA GET THAT WITH RERUNS OF GILLIGAN'S ISLAND.
GILLIGAN'S ISLAND.
♪ DA DA-DA DA ♪ YEAH, THE ONE WITH THE BOAT.
YEAH, BUZZSAW! LEON?
I THINK MAYBE DYNAMO, BUT...
BUT BUZZSAW WAS LAST YEAR'S CHAMPION.
I CAN'T DECIDE. THEN DON'T DECIDE, LEON.
HARD DECISIONS CALL FOR HARD SOLUTIONS.
HERE ARE TWO HARD ASSES READY TO TAKE CHARGE.
YOU ASKED FOR THEM, YOU GOT THEM.
HERE THEY ARE-- BUZZSAW AND DYNAMO!
PHIL, TELL US ALL ABOUT THIS CHAMPION TAG TEAM.
LET'S GIVE A DOWN-HOME WELCOME TO BUZZSAW EDDIE VATOWSKI,
LAST SEASON'S LEADING STALKER.
BUZZSAW'S CHAINSAWS ARE MADE OF TRYLON COATED DURA-STEEL
AND CAN CUT MUSCLE, BONE OR EVEN SOLID STEEL!
THE RATINGS JUMPED EIGHT POINTS.
EIGHT? MAKE THAT NINE POINTS.
I LOVE BEN RICHARDS.
WANT ANOTHER SURPRISE? WHAT?
REMEMBER THE GIRL WHO WAS WITH RICHARDS AT THE AIRPORT?
WITH THE CUTE ASS?
THEY CAUGHT HER DOWNSTAIRS. SHE WAS PULLING THE BAKERSFIELD VIDEO.
SENSATIONAL.
SENSATIONAL. ...DYNAMO!
THANK YOU. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S BEEN AN EXCITING SHOW SO FAR.
WE'VE HAD SHOCKS, WE'VE HAD SURPRISES.
WE THOUGHT, "WHY NOT ONE MORE SURPRISE?"
HA HA! WILL YOU PLEASE HELP ME WELCOME OUR MYSTERY CONTESTANT--
MISS AMBER MENDEZ!
LET ME GO!
AMBER, NOW, I UNDERSTAND
AMBER, NOW, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE SINGLE, AMBER,
AND THAT YOU LIVE ON THE WEST SIDE.
NOT SURPRISINGLY, SHE'S FLAUNTED THE LAW
AND TRADITIONAL MORALITY ALL OF HER LIFE.
GO AHEAD. TELL SOME LIES ABOUT ME NOW.
WE DON'T LIE. PHIL, TELL US ALL ABOUT HER.
IT'S CLEAR, COME ON!
WEISS, WHAT IS IT? THE CAMERA RELAY. IT'S NOT POINTING UP.
THE CAMERA RELAY. IT'S NOT POINTING UP. WHO GIVES A DAMN?
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
LATER, SHE CHEATED ON COLLEGE EXAMS,
HAD SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH TWO, SOMETIMES THREE DIFFERENT MEN IN A YEAR,
WITH TWO, SOMETIMES THREE DIFFERENT MEN IN A YEAR,
AND THEN SHE MET "MAD DOG" BEN RICHARDS,
HER CONFEDERATE, HER LOVER.
THAT WAS A LIE!
DEAR, DEAR, DEAR. LET'S REUNITE THESE LITTLE LOVEBIRDS.
GO! AAH!
IT'S GOT TO BE HERE.
WHAT IS GOING ON?
THE RELAYS ARE THE SAME.
THEY POINT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME ZONE.
THE UPLINK TO THE NETWORK SATELLITE IS IN THERE.
NO WONDER MIC'S PEOPLE COULDN'T FIND IT.
IF WE FIND THAT UPLINK, WE CAN CRACK THE CODE. JAM THE NETWORK.
JAM THE NETWORK? THAT'S RIGHT.
FORGET THIS CRAZY BUSINESS!
FORGET THIS CRAZY BUSINESS! WE GOT TO MOVE ON.
LET'S GO! MOVE, MOVE!
CHRIST!
STALKERS, WE'VE GOT A BEAD--
2O DEGREES NORTH, MARK 7, 12 DEGREES EAST, MARK 2.
COME ON, BROTHERS!
LET'S WIN ONE FOR THE ZERO!
"UPLINKS. UNDERGROUND."
YOU GUYS DON'T SHUT UP, I'M GOING TO UPLINK YOUR ASS.
YOU'LL BE UNDERGROUND!
WATCH OUT! THE LIGHTS!
LET'S GO! SHH.
SOMEONE'S COMING.
RICHARDS, WAIT! IT'S AMBER!
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF ME.
YOU THINK I'M GLAD TO BE HERE? WHO THE HELL IS THIS?
SHE TURNED ME IN AT THE AIRPORT. THIS IS HER REWARD.
OH YEAH, GO AHEAD. MAKE JOKES.
IT'S YOUR FAULT I'M HERE.
THEY THINK I'M HELPING YOU OUT. THEY EVEN THINK I'M YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
WE'LL STRAIGHTEN THAT OUT. SEE THIS CAMERA UP THERE? I CAN STRANGLE YOU FOR THE HOME AUDIENCE.
ANOTHER RELAY. QUICK!
WEISS! WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?
WEISS! WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT? LET'S GO.
WEISS, OVER HERE!
RICHARDS! LOOK OUT!
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
RICHARDS, HELP! WAIT!
LAUGHLIN, MOVE IT!
YEAH. LET'S GO.
GIVE ME YOUR MONEY. OK. OK.
HEY, MAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HEY!
THE RESISTANCE WANTS TO JAM THE NETWORK.
HERE'S OUR CHANCE.
LET'S GO! NO. THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT.
IT'S THE UPLINK TO THE NETWORK SATELLITE.
HE'S GOING TO FIND US.
WEISS, COME ON. WEISS.
OVER THERE.
HEY!
WHO LOVES YOU, AND WHO DO YOU LOVE?
LET ME HEAR IT.

JACKPOT! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WEISS? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WEISS? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT'S THIS, WEISS? IT'S THE UPLINK INTERFACE. LOOK OUT.
GREAT! HEXAGONAL DECODE SYSTEM.
NOT IMPOSSIBLE. IT'LL JUST TAKE A LITTLE TIME.
YOUR NAME IS AMBER, RIGHT? YEAH.
AMBER, I NEED YOU TO REMEMBER THESE NUMBERS.
WE'VE GOT TO GET THEM TO MIC.
ALL RIGHT, I WILL! THEN LET'S GO!
RICHARDS, I LOVE THIS SAW.
THIS SAW IS PART OF ME. AND I'M GONNA MAKE IT PART OF YOU!
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
KEEP IT.
18, 24.
COME ON.
18, 24. 61. B.
SAY THEM. SAY THEM!
SAY THEM. SAY THEM! 18, 24, 61, B. CAN WE GO?
18, 24, 61, B. CAN WE GO? NOT YET. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
NOT YET. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
17, 17.

GO TO COMMERCIALS. JESUS CHRIST! I HAVE NO POWER.
CUT! GO TO COMMERCIAL!
KILL HIM!
NO. I WON'T KILL A HELPLESS HUMAN BEING,
NOT EVEN SADISTIC SCUM LIKE YOU.
OH, MY GOD! BOO!
COME ON! DO IT!
WHAT HAPPENED TO BUZZSAW? HE HAD TO SPLIT.
BOO! HEY, WHAT AN INCREDIBLE BATTLE!
BUZZSAW GONE, DYNAMO DOWN,
BUT THE STALK ISN'T OVER TILL THE FAT LADY SINGS,
AND THE VERY LAST CRIMINAL...
FIREBALL, REPORT TO WARDROBE AT ONCE.
FIREBALL, YOU'RE WANTED IN WARDROBE.
AND OUR HALFTIME SHOW!
LAUGHLIN, BREAK'S OVER.
COME ON. LET'S GET GOING.
I'M GOING SOMEWHERE, BUT NOT WITH YOU.
BUZZSAW TOOK CARE OF MY... TRAVELING ARRANGEMENTS.
OH, MY GOD.
WEISS?
HE IS DEAD.
BUT HE GAVE ME THE CODE,
THE SATELLITE UPLINK CODE.
THE UNDERGROUND HAS A BROADCAST CENTER IN QUADRANT FOUR.
TAKE HER. TAKE HER AND THE CODE TO MIC.
DON'T LET US DIE FOR NOTHING.
LISTEN, WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU.
DON'T LET US DOWN.
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONLY ASSHOLE IN HEAVEN. BEN.
HE SAVED MY LIFE.
IT SHOULD BE ME DOWN THERE.
WE GOT THEM? HEY, BEN?
I GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU, PAL.
YOU GOT THE WHOLE NETWORK IN AN UPROAR.
THEY'RE SHIPPING BICARB TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN CRATES.
THIS CALL IS BETWEEN US.
IT'S NOT ON THE AIR.
LISTEN CAREFULLY, BEN.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE A THREE-YEAR CONTRACT, GUARANTEED,
A CADRE CREDIT LINE, AND A BEACH-FRONT CONDO?
SOUND IMPOSSIBLE?
BEN, THAT'S THE STANDARD DEAL FOR A NETWORK STALKER.
I KNOW REAL TALENT.
I'D HATE TO SEE YOU GET CANCELED TONIGHT
WHEN YOU COULD GO THE DISTANCE.
SAY THE WORD, BEN. YOU COULD BE DOING THE STALKING.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU COLD-BLOODED BASTARD. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK OF IT,
I'LL LIVE TO SEE YOU EAT THAT CONTRACT.
BUT LEAVE ROOM FOR MY FIST
BECAUSE I'LL RAM IT INTO YOUR STOMACH
AND BREAK YOUR GODDAMN SPINE!
DAMON, IT'S FOR YOU.
W-WHO? IT'S THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
GET OUT. EVERYBODY, OUT.
COME ON. MOVE.
YES.
FIREBALL! FIREBALL! FIREBALL! FIREBALL!
COME ON, FIREBALL.
LET'S GO!
HE'S MY HERO! HE'S MY HERO!
FIREBALL!
THERE HE GOES. FIREBALL'S ON HIS WAY.
DYNAMO'S DOWN, BUT NOT OUT. BACK TO YOU, DAMON.
BACK TO YOU, DAMON. ALL RIGHT, AGNES. LISTEN NOW. BIG CHANCE FOR YA.
WIN LOTS OF PRIZES.
WE'VE STILL GOT TWO CRACK STALKERS--
DYNAMO AND FIREBALL.
WHO WILL MAKE THE NEXT KILL?
OH, BOY. THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.
GIVE IT A TRY. WHO DO YOU THINK?
OK. I THINK THE NEXT KILL
WILL BE MADE BY... BEN RICHARDS.
BEN RICHARDS. HOLD IT. HOLD IT.
AGNES, RICHARDS IS A RUNNER. YOU'VE GOT TO PICK A STALKER.
I CAN PICK ANYONE I CHOOSE,
AND I CHOOSE... BEN RICHARDS. RICHARDS?

YOU WANT IT. YOU GOT IT.
PLACE YOUR BET. PLACE YOUR BET.
SECRET BROADCAST CENTER MY ASS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT LAUGHLIN WAS TALKING ABOUT. THERE'S NOTHING OUT HERE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT LAUGHLIN WAS TALKING ABOUT. THERE'S NOTHING OUT HERE. WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT TRIP TO HAWAII.
WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT TRIP TO HAWAII.
I HAD THE SHIRT FOR IT, BUT YOU FUCKED IT UP.
JESUS CHRIST!
GUESS AGAIN.
COME ON, KEEP UP.
I'M RUNNING TOO FAST. MY FEET CAN'T KEEP UP!
THERE HE GOES, THE NUMBER-ONE RUSHER.
HE SMELLS BLOOD, AND NOTHING ON EARTH CAN STOP HIM.
WAIT. I DON'T WANT TO GO.
RICHARDS!
HERE. THIS WAY.
WHY? I WANT TO GO THAT WAY.
LET GO OF ME.
PUT ME DOWN.
YOU'RE GOING TO GET US KILLED.
AAH! STOP IT!
RICHARDS!
LET ME GO!
AMBER, GET OUT OF HERE.
GO! NOW!
AMBER!
Richards!
Richards!
Richards.
Whitman.
Price.
HADDAD.
THEY'RE RUNNING MEN.
LAST SEASON'S WINNERS.
NO. LAST SEASON'S LOSERS.
WHY CAN'T I FLY? WHY CAN'T I FLY?
HOW ABOUT A LIGHT?
WHAT A HOTHEAD.
YEAH, RICHARDS!
CAPTAIN FREEDOM TO WARDROBE ON THE DOUBLE.
FORGET IT, KILLIAN. I WON'T DO IT.
IT'S NOT A REQUEST, MORON, IT'S AN ORDER.
I DON'T NEED THIS CRAP.
THIS STUFF IS...GARBAGE!
I-- I USED TO KILL GUYS LIKE THIS WITH MY HANDS.
I'M NOT USING ANY TRICKS.
THIS IS A SPORT OF DEATH AND HONOR.
CODE OF THE GLADIATORS!
SPARE ME THE COMBAT ZEN SPEECH.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON?
THIS ISN'T A GAME!
THEY'RE BETTING ON RICHARDS UP THERE!
BULLSHIT.
GET OUT OF HERE.
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!
WHAT'S THE MATTER? STEROIDS MAKE YOU DEAF?
GET HIM OUT OF HERE NOW!
NOW WHAT?
LET'S FIND MIC'S SECRET BROADCAST CENTER,
IF IT EVEN EXISTS.
OH, SHIT!
LET'S TRY THAT WAY.
WE'RE TRAPPED.
SUBZERO, FIREBALL, AND BUZZSAW.
SAY THEIR NAMES WITH REVERENT PRIDE.
THEY PUNISHED CRIME AND SERVED THE LAW.
AS PATRIOTS, THEY DIED.
I HATE THIRD-ACT PROBLEMS. ROLL... STOCK.
FREEZE IN DIGITAL MEMORY.
AND... ACTIVATE TRAVELING MATTE.
TONY, THIS BETTER WORK, OR YOU'LL BE A DIGITAL MEMORY.
TAKE IT EASY, DAMON. WE'RE LOADING RICHARDS' IMAGE ONTO THE DATA BASE.
WHEN HE'S MAPPED ONTO THE STUNT DOUBLE, YOU'LL NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.
ALL RIGHT, BOYS. LET'S SEE YOU DANCE.
SENSATIONAL. I LOVE IT!
MR. RICHARDS, YOU'RE SO EASILY CAUGHT.
WELCOME TO THE PEOPLE'S NETWORK. WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.
THIS IS NICE, MIC,
BUT YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN OFF YOUR ASSES AND HELPED US.
WE'D HAVE BEEN SEEN.
THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE FOUND US.
LAUGHLIN, WEISS WOULD HAVE DIED FOR NOTHING.
THEY DIDN'T.
I HAVE THE UPLINK CODE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'VE GOT AN UPDATE
ON TONIGHT'S INCREDIBLE ACTION.
THE RUNNERS HAVE ENTERED THE FINAL QUAD.
CAPTAIN FREEDOM HAS HUNG UP HIS ANNOUNCER'S MIKE
AND COME OUT OF RETIREMENT.
HE'S READY FOR THE FINAL CONFLICT.
LET'S GO NOW, LIVE, TO THE GAME ZONE!
YES, IT'S ALL OVER! WHAT A COLOSSAL FIGHT! THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT IN SPORTS.
CAPTAIN FREEDOM, OUT OF RETIREMENT AND UNDEFEATED--
PROVING THAT FRIGHT AND MIGHT ARE ONE AND THE SAME!
DAMN THAT KILLIAN!
WHAT'S WRONG? YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY. WE'RE OFFICIALLY DEAD.
WE CAN DO ANYTHING. NO, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY'LL NEVER LET US OUT ALIVE.
NO, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY'LL NEVER LET US OUT ALIVE. THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. THEY'LL HUNT US DOWN.
THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. THEY'LL HUNT US DOWN.
OFF CAMERA, OF COURSE.
OK. DISMANTLE ALL THE OVERLAYS.
PUT THE DIGITAL MATTE IN THE PIXEL MEMORY STORAGE.
THE DAMN THING WORKED LIKE A CHARM.
IT SHOULD. EDITEL CHARGED US AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE SOFTWARE.
DAMON! YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO KILL HIM!
IT'S PART OF LIFE, BRENDA.
YOU BETTER FUCKING GET USED TO IT.
THAT'S ONE FOR THE AWARD SHOW.
THANK YOU. YOU'RE DOING NICE WORK.
TONY, YOU'RE FINALLY GETTING IT.
GUNS? YOU DON'T NEED GUNS TO JAM A SATELLITE.
I DO, TO KEEP IT.
THE MINUTE I STEAL THE SIGNAL, THE NETWORK WILL TRY TO SHUNT
THE MINUTE I STEAL THE SIGNAL, THE NETWORK WILL TRY TO SHUNT THE NEXT ONE IN ORBIT.
STEVIE'S GROUP WILL STOP THEM.
THESE KIDS?
THIS IS A BAD MOVE, MIC.
THEY NEED A LEADER, SOMEONE WITH EXPERIENCE.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR THE DOOR.
I TOLD KILLIAN I'D BE BACK.
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE A LIAR.
LISTEN UP, EVERYBODY.
I WANT YOU ALL TO CONSIDER YOURSELVES PICKED UP FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON.
PICKED UP FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON.
ARE YOU MY PEOPLE OR AN OIL PAINTING?
WE'RE UP NINE POINTS. COME ON, NOW. LET'S GO, CHAMP.
COME ON, NOW. LET'S GO, CHAMP.
WE'RE GOING TO SEND THE UPLINK CODE IN 20 MINUTES.
10 SECONDS LATER, I'LL GO ON THE AIR.
WE'LL BE READY.
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION, FORGET THE SPEECH.
TRY THIS INSTEAD.
WHAT IS IT?
THE ORIGINAL VIDEO FROM THE BAKERSFIELD MASSACRE
BEFORE THEY EDITED FOR BROADCASTING.
WHERE DID YOU HIDE THAT?
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
HEY, WHAT THE HELL--UH!
SIX MINUTES. BEGIN SATELLITE CODING SEQUENCE.
LOAD UPLINK CODE INTO TRANSPONDER GRID.
SHUNT POWER TO MAIN CIRCUITS.
MR. SPOCK, YOU HAVE THE COM.
WHO'S MR. SPOCK?
COME ON. LET ME HEAR IT NOW.
WHOO! WHOO!
WELCOME TO THE POSTGAME WRAP-UP SHOW.
LADIES, I LOVED YOU.
THANK YOU, YOUNG MAN.
HELLO, YOU'RE ON THE AIR.
HI, DAMON. I'M WENDY. I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT DYNAMO.
IS HE SERIOUSLY HURT? HE'LL BE FINE.
HE'LL BE FINE. GOOD LUCK.
HE'S UNDER FACTORY WARRANTY.
YOU, TOO.
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.
I FEEL BAD ABOUT THE DEAD STALKERS.
MAY I MAKE A DONATION TO THEIR FAMILIES?
WHAT A DARLING.
SEND YOUR CHECKS TO THE PATRIOT'S FUND, CARE OF THIS STATION--
THREE, TWO, ONE.
THAT'S IT. WE GOT THAT BABY!
THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.
WHO LOVES YOU, AND WHO DO YOU LOVE?
DAMON! YES! YES! YES!
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WE DON'T LIE...
LIKE OUR PREVIOUS WINNERS, WHITMAN, PRICE, AND HADDAD.
THERE THEY ARE, AT THIS VERY MOMENT,
BASKING UNDER THE MAUI SUN, THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY PAID IN FULL.
WATCH...THAT SCREEN.
YANKEE NINE-NINER. WHAT'S THE CROWD'S STATUS?
FOOD RIOT IN PROGRESS. APPROXIMATELY 1500 CIVILIANS.
NO WEAPONS EVIDENT.
PROCEED WITH PLAN ALPHA. ELIMINATE ANYTHING MOVING.
THE CROWD IS UNARMED.
THERE ARE LOTS OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
ALL THEY WANT IS FOOD!
PROCEED WITH PLAN ALPHA. ALL RIOTERS MUST BE ELIMINATED.
I WON'T FIRE AT HELPLESS PEOPLE.
WHERE'S IT COMING FROM? THE NETWORK SATELLITE.
ABORT MISSION. RETURN TO BASE.
DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL.
DETAIN RICHARDS. PROCEED AS ORDERED.
RICHARDS, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! PLEASE BEAR WITH US!
WE'RE EXPERIENCING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES!
BULLSHIT!
IT'S SHOWTIME!
GET THE PEOPLE OUT! COME ON!
THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY OUT IN THE ZONE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW, BITCH?
WHY AREN'T YOU LAUGHING?
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT A DICKLESS MORON
WITH A BATTERY UP HIS ASS.
OUT! OUT!
I'LL SHOW YOU DICKLESS!
GET OUT OF THE WAY! GET DOWN! DOWN!
LET'S GO!
HELLO, CUTIE PIE.
ONE OF US IS IN DEEP TROUBLE.
SVEN, DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO MR. RICHARDS?
WELL?
I GOT TO SCORE SOME STEROIDS.
YOU LOOK PISSED, BEN.
BELIEVE ME, YOU GOT EVERY RIGHT TO BE.
BUT WILL YOU LET ME EXPLAIN?
THIS IS TELEVISION.
IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH PEOPLE. IT'S RATINGS.
FOR 50 YEARS, WE'VE TOLD THEM WHAT TO EAT,
WHAT TO DRINK, WHAT TO WEAR.
BEN, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
AMERICANS LOVE TELEVISION.
THEY WEAN THEIR KIDS ON IT.
THEY LOVE GAME SHOWS, THEY LOVE WRESTLING.
THEY LOVE SPORTS AND VIOLENCE.
SO WHAT DO WE DO?
WE GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT!
WE'RE NUMBER ONE, BEN. THAT'S ALL THAT COUNTS.
BELIEVE ME. I'VE DONE THIS FOR 30 YEARS.
I HAVEN'T BEEN IN SHOW BUSINESS AS LONG AS YOU HAVE,
BUT I'M A QUICK LEARNER.
SO I'M GIVING THE AUDIENCE WHAT I THINK THEY WANT.
WAAH! OOH!
YOU BASTARD! DROP DEAD!
I DON'T DO REQUESTS.
NO!
WELL, THAT HIT THE SPOT.
YEAH!
ALL RIGHT! YEAH!

Look, um...Mills?
I-I thought we might find a bar someplace. You know, sit--
Well, I'd like to get to the precinct, if it's all the same.
You know, not much time for this transition thing.
I meant to ask you somethin' when we spoke on the phone before.
Yep.
Why here?
I don't follow.
Well, all this effort to get transferred.
It's the first question that popped into my head.
I guess for the same reasons as you.
Or the same reasons you had before you decided to quit. Yeah?
You, you just met me.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
It's very simple.
You actually fought to get reassigned here.
Now, I've just never seen it done that way before.
I thought I could do some good. Look, it would be great for me
if we didn't start out kicking each other in the balls.
If you're calling the shots, Lieutenant-- Yes.
I want you to look and I want you to listen, okay?
Now, I wasn't standing around guarding the Taco Bell.
I've worked Homicide, five years.
- Not here. - I understand that.
Well, over the next seven days, detective
you'll do me the favor of remembering that.
Hello? Yep.
Okay.
'Say it again.'
I thought we moved here to get away from tractor pulls.
Serpico's gotta go.
Yeah, well, you might wanna get rid of this little crusty.
This eye, Serpico.
- Did you get it? - Got it.
Good.
Coffee? No?
Nothing's been touched. Everything's like I found it.
What time was death established? Like I said..
...I didn't touch anything.
But he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti for about 45 minutes now.
Wait a minute. No one bothers with vital signs?
Did I stutter?
This guy ain't breathin' unless he started breathin' spaghetti sauce.
So that's how it's done around here? Hey, I beg your pardon, detective
but this guy's been sittin' in a pile of his own piss and shit.
If he wasn't dead, he would've stood up by now.
- Alright, thank you, officer. - Okay.
Thank you.
I wonder.
What exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
Don't know, how many times has
Don't know, how many times has Barney Fife found dead bodies that weren't dead?
Drop it.
Somebody phone Guinness. I think we've got a record here.
"Better Homes And Gardens."
Who said this was murder?
No one.
Guy's heart's gotta be the size of a canned ham.
'If this isn't a coronary' 'well, I don't know.'
How about that?
We had this case once.
'Guy dead on the ground.'
'Knife in his back.'
Gotta be murder, right?
Fuck.
'Anyway, big insurance policy involved, yeah?'
'So the guy took the tip of the blade' 'stuck it in his own shoulder blades.'
And he must've screwed up a few times because there was multiples back there.
Could you please be quiet?
Wait a minute.
What?
Got a bucket here.
What's in it?
Agh! Ugh, God.
Fucking vomit.
Any blood in it?
I-I didn't see any. Help yourself.
Are you thinking it's poison?
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.
You thinking it's poison, Somerset?
You girls have got Forensics waiting outside.
I don't know if we'll all fit, though. There's room, light's the problem.
- Hi, how are you? - Hey.
Detective Mills, would you go help the officers 'question the neighbors?'
What? Send in Forensics on your way out, please.
He's dead.
Thank you, doctor.
You've seen my files, right? You seen the things I've done.
Nope.
Well, I did my time on door-to-doors and walking the beat. I did that shit for a long time.
and walking the beat. I did that shit for a long time.
And?
Badge on my belt says "Detective." That's the same as yours.
Look, I made a decision.
I had to consider the integrity of the scene.
Couldn't worry whether you thought you were getting enough time on the playing field.
Hey, man..
...just don't be jerking me off, that's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.
He's been dead a long time.
And I can tell you, it was not from poison.
Oh, man. How does someone let themselves go like that?
(male #4) 'It took four orderlies just to get him on the table.'
How'd the fat fuck ever fit out his front door?
Please. It's obvious he was a shut-in.
Now, look at this.
See how big this stomach is?
And the strange thing is, it stretches.
Here, look at the size of the cardiac orifice where the food--
Wait, I-I see what you're pointing out but that means nothing to me.
Okay, he's got lines of distention 'across the duodenum.'
And the interior wall is ripped open.
This man ate till he burst?
He didn't really burst. Not all the way.
He was hemorrhaging internally.
And there was a hematoma in the rectus 'and transverse abdominis muscles.'
So he did die by eating.
Yes and no.
What about these bruises up here?
Well, I haven't figured that out yet.
Gun pressed against his head?
Pressed hard enough, sure.
Fuck, yeah.
Marks from the front side, flush with the muzzle.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a homicide.
(Somerset) 'Killer put a bucket beneath him, kept on serving.'
'Took his time, too.'
Coroner said this could've gone on for more than 12 hours.
'Victim's throat was swollen, probably from the effort.'
And there was definitely a point when he passed out.
That's when the killer kicked him, and he burst.
Ooph! Sadistic fucker, huh?
(Somerset) 'When you want somebody dead, you drive by and shoot him.'
You don't risk the time it takes to do this.
Unless the act itself has meaning. (male #5) Come on.
Somebody had a problem with the fat boy and decided to torture him. Simple as that.
and decided to torture him. Simple as that.
In the grocery bags, we found two receipts.
That means the killer stopped in the middle of everything
and made a second trip to the supermarket.
So?
Hey, man, it's his thing. I've been out in the rain all day.
This is beginning.
We've got one dead guy, not three.
No motive.
Don't even start that big brain of yours cooking on this, alright? Please.
cooking on this, alright? Please. I'd like to be reassigned.
- What? What, whoa? - 'What?'
- What? What, whoa? - 'What?' What in the hell are you talkin' about?
This can't be my last duty.
It's just gonna go on, and on, and on.
You're retiring.
Six more days and you're all the way gone.
'Won't be the first time you've left unfinished--'
Those other cases were taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.
And if I may speak freely?
(male #5) 'We're all friends here.'
This should not be his first assignment.
Oh, come on, I knew it.
This is not my first assignment, you dick.
- It's too soon for him. - Hey, man.
You know, I'm right here. You can say that shit to my face.
- Captain-- - It's too soon for you.
Captain, if we can just talk in private?
Obviously, this isn't working. It's a personal thing.
- Maybe-- - Just shut up, Mills.
- Maybe-- - Just shut up, Mills. Look, I don't have anyone else to put on this and you know it.
This is Metro. You don't just get to swap.
- Give it to me. - Say what?
- Give it to me. - Say what? Yeah, he doesn't want it, fuck him.
Sorry, but see you later. Have a nice time.
- Give it to me. - No. I'm putting you on something else.
Go on, Mills.
Just go on.
I'm sorry, old buddy
but it looks like you're stuck 'cleaning up the fat man.'
(Martin) Alright, here we go. Quiet down.
Alright, calm down. Calm down.
Quiet down.
'Calm down. Quiet down.'
'Now, here's how it's gonna work.'
I'll answer questions for ten minutes and ten minutes only.
If those questions do not come in a calm sane and orderly fashion
I'm on my way out here.
Detective? Detective?
Detective? Detective? Can I have a moment of your time?
I will not discuss the details of this ongoing investigation
so don't even bother asking.
- What do you guys got for me? - 'Nothing yet, boss.'
Why don't you guys, uh, go get a coffee, huh?
(woman on TV) 'We have this breaking story for you.'
'We're going to go live downtown'
where Defense Attorney Eli Gould was found murdered this morning.
'District Attorney Martin Talbot' 'is taking questions from reporters.'
(male #6) 'There could be a conflict of interest between your officers.'
That is ridiculous to the point of being offensive. 'There is no conflict whatsoever.'
And any claim that there could be is irresponsible.
And any claim that there could be is irresponsible. - 'Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot.' - Now, hold on.
- 'Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot.' - Now, hold on. (male #7) 'It's a rumor that you're far'
'from apprehending a suspect.' (Martin) 'Let me address that.' 'I've just come from a meeting'
'of law enforcement officials' and they've assured me
and they've assured me
they have their very best men on this.
This will be the very definition of swift justice.
(male #5) Pardon me, George.
- Somerset. - Come in.
- Have you heard the news? - 'Nope, haven't heard.'
Eli Gould was found murdered this morning.
Someone broke into his law firm and bled him to death.
Wrote the word "Greed" on the floor.
- Greed? - Yeah, in blood.
Mills is heading up the investigation.
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me?
Could you not do that, please?
Oh, okay.
Well, good for him.
What in the hell are you gonna do with yourself out there, Somerset?
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.
- Fix my house. - Don't you feel it?
Don't you feel that feeling?
You're not gonna be a cop anymore.
That's the whole idea.
I don't think you're leaving.
Hell, you can't leave all this.
Guy's out walking his dog.
'Gets attacked.'
'His watch is taken, his wallet.'
While he's lying there on the sidewalk, helpless..
...his attacker stabs him in both eyes.
Now, this happened just last night about four blocks from here.
Yeah, I read about it.
I don't understand this place any longer. It's the way it's always been.
- Maybe you're right. - You do this work.
You were made for it, and I don't think you can deny that.
Maybe I'm wrong.
Oh, uh, the coroner sent this down for you.
Found them in fat boy's stomach, mixed in with food.
Looks like plastic, little pieces of plastic-- Set them on the desk, please.
They were, uh..
They were fed to him.
Oh, Lord.
This was found on the wall behind the refrigerator
in the obesity murder scene.
"Long is the way and hard that out of hell leads up to light."
It's from Milton.
'"Paradise Lost."'
Alright, I'm confused.
It means that this is beginning.
This was found behind the same refrigerator.
Written in grease.
There are seven deadly sins, captain.
Gluttony.
Greed.
Sloth, wrath pride, lust..
...and envy.
- Seven. - Hold on.
This is not even my desk.
You can expect five more of these.
Now, wait a minute.
I can't get involved in this.
Somerset.
He wanted it.
- Damn. - I'm all over it.
Where you headed?
Far away from here.
- Thanks, George. - Hey.
- How you doing? - Okay.
Just a few things to look up.
Okay, sit where you'd like.
How's everybody?
- 'Whoo!' - Hi, smiley.
Come on, George, the cards are getting cold.
Duty calls.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
I'll never understand.
All these books
'a world of knowledge at your fingertips.'
And what do you do?
You play poker all night.
Hey, we got culture.
Yeah, we got culture coming out of our asses.
- 'Alright.' - 'Yeah.'
How's this for culture?
You know, smiley..
...you're really gonna miss us.
I just might.
Fucking Dante.
Goddamn poetry-writing faggot piece of shit.
Fucker.
Yeah. Yeah?
Good work, officer.
Thank you, Lord.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Be out of your way in a second.
- You want your chair? - No. You go ahead.
- You go ahead. - Yeah?
Phone.
It's a package deal. Comes with the office.
Mills.
- 'Honey.' - Honey.. - Are you okay, something wrong? - 'No.'
You, dingleberry, I, uh, I told you not to call me here when I'm workin'.
'Yeah. Why?'
Why?
- Why? - 'Come on.'
Okay.
It's my wife.
Sorry?
She'd like to speak to you.
Uh, this is Detective Somerset.
(Tracy) 'Oh, it's nice to speak with you.'
Well, it-it-it's nice to talk to you, too.
I-I appreciate the offer, but..
Well, in that case, I'd be delighted. (Tracy) 'Great.'
- Yes, thank you very much. - 'Thank you. See you later.'
Bye.
Hon, what..
Well?
- I'm sorry? Oh, uh. - What?
I've been invited to a late supper at your apartment.
I accepted.
At my.. How's that?
Tonight.
(woman over radio) '21-57.'
Hello, men.
- Hi, loser. - Hi, idiot.
This is Tracy. Tracy..
- 'Somerset.' - Hello.
I'm very happy to meet you. I've heard a lot about you.
Except, of course, your first name.
It's William.
Hmm, well, it's a good name, William.
William, I'd like you to meet David.
- David, this is William. - Okay, alright, I'm gonna..
I'll be right back.
- 'How are the kids?' - They're good.
They're in the room. Come on in.
Oh, good dogs.
How are you, good dogs? How are you, pretty?
(Mills) 'How are you?'
'How are you?'
'You are?'
- Smells good. - What?
- Uh.. - Oh, yeah. I mean, thank you.
Um, please have a seat, if you like. 'Would you like something to drink?'
Uh, no. No, thanks. Uh, I'll wait.
Uh, no. No, thanks. Uh, I'll wait. Okay, you can just throw that anywhere.
You'll have to excuse all this mess. You know, we're still unpacking.
I understand you two were high school sweethearts. (Tracy) 'Mm-hmm.'
Pretty hokey, huh?
You know something?
I knew on our first date that this was the guy I was gonna marry.
- Really? - Mm-hmm.
He was the funniest guy I'd ever met.
Really?
Well, it's kind of rare nowadays, you know.
I mean.. ...that level of commitment.
Oh, don't worry.
I won't wear it to the dinner table. No. I, uh..
No. I, uh.. You know, no matter how often I see guns, I just
I, I can't get used to them.
Same here.
Why aren't you married, William?
Oh, Trace, what the hell?
I was close once.
It just didn't happen.
It surprises me.
I mean, it really does.
Well..
Anyone who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me disagreeable.
'Just ask your husband.'
Very true.
Very, very true.
So how long have you lived here?
Too long.
How are you liking it?
You know.. ...takes time, settle in.
It'll be good.
Well, you get numb after awhile.
There are things to any city.
Subway.
- It will go away in a minute. - It's nothin'.
The real estate guy..
Fucking piece of..
Sorry, honey. He's..
He shows us the place a few times.
I think he's good. He's efficient.
'Tracy really likes him.'
But then I start wondering why will he only bring us here for five minutes at a time, yeah?
We found out the first night.
The soothing, relaxing.. ...vibrating home, huh?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, alright, laugh it up.
Y-you know, I don't know why you're laughing.
(Mills) Alright, already.
And the guy would've had to get into the building
before the office was closed and security tightened.
Now, Gould would've been working late.
I'm certain. He was the biggest defense lawyer in town.
- Infamous, really. - Now, listen.
The body was found on Tuesday morning.
The office was closed on Monday, which means.. ...the guy could've gotten in Friday
'laid low till the cleaning crew left' then had his way with Gould all day Saturday
Sunday, maybe even Monday.
Hey, look at this.
Gould was bound, right arm almost free.
He was handed a butcher's knife.
'Check out the scale.'
(Somerset) A pound of flesh?
Yeah.
"One pound of flesh No more, no less.
"No cartilage, no bone but only flesh."
- "Merchant of Venice." - Didn't see it.
"This task done and he would go free."
I'm telling you that chair was soaked through with sweat.
Of course.
The killer would've wanted Gould to take his time..
...to sit and decide which cut to make first.
'Imagine it.'
There's a gun in your face.
Which part of your body is expendable?
How about the love handle?
Cut along the side of his own stomach.
Alright, let's take a fresh look at these.
Even though the corpse is there, look through it.
'Edit out the initial shock.'
Trick is to find one item one detail and focus on it
until it's an exhausted possibility.
I'm just gonna get another beer.
Beer? Uh, wine, please.
He's preaching.
He's punishing.
The sins were used in medieval sermons.
There were seven cardinal virtues and seven deadly sins used as teaching tools.
and seven deadly sins used as teaching tools.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like in, uh, "The Parson's Tale," and..
'What's this? Uh, Dante.'
- You read them? - Yeah.
Well, parts. Hey, remember in, uh, "Purgatory?"
'Dante and his buddy, they're climbing up the hill'
they're checking out all the sinners, yeah?
Yeah, the seven terraces of purgation. Yeah, yeah, right.
But there, pride comes first.. ...not gluttony.
Yeah, well, for now, let's just consider that the books 'were the killer's inspiration.'
The sermons were about atonement for sin.
These murders are like forced attrition.
- Forced what? - Attrition.
It's when you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
Oh, like because someone's sticking a fucking gun in your face.
- No fingerprints. - Nope.
- Totally unrelated victims. - 'Yep.'
And no witnesses of any kind.
Which I don't get
because the fucker had to get back out.
Well, in any major city, minding your own business 'is a science.'
The first thing they teach women in rape prevention is never cry for help.
'Always yell "Fire."'
'Nobody answers to "Help."'
You holler "Fire," they come running.
That's fucked up.
He must've left another puzzle piece.
[sighs] You know what?
Thank you for talking this out but I gotta sleep. And walk the dogs.
but I gotta sleep. And walk the dogs. Oh, this is just strictly to satisfy my curiosity.
I'm still leaving at the end of the week. Oh, shit.
No, wait, wait.
'Gould's wife, but she was out of town at the time.'
'So this means she saw something.' What if it's a threat?
Well, I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.
(Somerset) What if it isn't something she has seen?
But something she's supposed to see but hasn't been given a chance?
Yeah, okay. What?
I don't know.
But that's the one thing.
- 'Sign us in.' - Yeah.
Gotta see Mrs. Gould.
(Mrs. Gould) 'Yeah, and treat me like a prisoner.'
'Yeah, well, why do you have a phone in my room' 'if I can't make long distance phone calls?'
Mrs. Gould? (Mrs. Gould) 'You don't treat people like this.'
Mrs. Gould, I am sorry. I truly am.
I don't understand.
Okay, I need you to look at each photo.. '...very carefully.'
'Look and see if there's anything strange' or out of place.
Um, anything at all.
- I don't see anything. - You're sure?
Please, I-I just.. I can't do this right now.
Okay.
[Somerset whispers] It's got to be now.
There may be something we haven't seen.
(Mrs. Gould) Oh, wait.
- What? - Here.
This painting, i-it's upside down.
Are you sure your men didn't move this?
Oh, no, no, no, those shots were taken before forensics.
Nothing.
There's gotta be something.
- Moved the screws to rehang it. - 'Yep.'
What the fuck is that?
Switchblade.
Goddamn it!
There must be something.
He didn't paint the fucking thing.
Now, he's fuckin' with us, that's what he's doin'.
See this? This is us.
'Yeah.'
Just wait a minute.
Now Somerset's climbing on the furniture.
Just wait a minute.
You're kiddin' me.
Call the Print Lab.
Oh, man.
Honestly, have you ever seen anything like this?
No.
(male #8) 'I can tell you, guys' just by lookin' at the swirl pattern
they're not the victim's fingerprints.
I don't know, man. I say he's whacked enough.
It doesn't fit.
(Somerset) 'He doesn't want us to help him stop.' (Mills) 'Who knows?'
So many freaks out there doin' their little evil deeds they don't wanna do.
"The voices made me do it. My dog made me do it."
"Jodie Foster told me to do it."
You know, um, I've seen this baby take as long as three days to make a match.
So, maybe you guys wanna cross your fingers somewhere else.
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?
About catching this guy. Yeah.
Hmm. Wish I still thought the way you do.
Why don't you tell me what the hell it is you think we're doin' then?
Picking up the pieces.
We're collecting all the evidence taking all the pictures and samples
writing everything down
noting the time things happened.
- That's all? - That's all.
Putting everything into neat little piles and filing it away.
On the off chance it will ever be needed in the courtroom.
Picking up diamonds on a deserted island.
Saving them in case we get rescued.
Bullshit.
Even the most promising clues usually only lead to others.
So many corpses roll away unrevenged.
Don't try to tell me you didn't get that rush tonight.
I saw you.
We're gettin' somewhere.
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.
You've got a winner.
This guy goes by the name of Victor. His real name is Theodore Allen.
'His prints were found at the scene by Homicide.'
'He's got a long history of serious mental illness.'
'His parents gave him a very strict' 'Southern Baptist upbringing.'
But somewhere along the line, they fell short.
Now, Victor dabbled in drugs, armed robbery and assault.
Spent some time in prison here a while back 'for the attempted rape of a minor.'
But his lawyer saw to it that that didn't last long.
His lawyer, by the way, is the recently-deceased Eli Gould.
- 'Greed murder victim.' - 'Yes, sir.'
Now, we're gonna finish this thing up today, ladies and germs.
'Victor's been out of circulation for a while' 'but there's still a residence in his name.'
You're not buyin' all this, are you?
Doesn't seem like our guy, does it? You tell me.
Our killer seems to have more purpose.
You ever take a bullet?
Never in my 34 years, knock wood.
I've only taken my gun out three times 'with the intention of using it.'
'Never pulled the trigger.'
Not once. You?
Yeah, but, no, I neve-never took a, never took a bullet but I pulled my gun once, shot it once.
- Really? - It was my first one of these.
We were a secondary unit.
I was pretty shaky going in. I was a rookie then.
Anyway, we bust open the door lookin' for this junkie and, uh..
...the fucker just opened fire on us.
One cop got hit in the arm.
Christ, what was his name?
'Spun him like a top.'
'You know, I mean, more like slow motion.'
I remember..
...ridin' in that ambulance.
'Well, he died right there.'
Right there.
Christ, what was his fuckin' name?
- All rise. - Let's do it. Let's do it.
(male #9) 'Go, go, go. Move.'
(male #10) 'Get up there.'
SWAT goes before dicks.
Chief.
They love this.
Police!
Clear!
- Clear! - Clear!
(male #11) 'Clear!'
(male #12) 'Clear!'
Morning, sweetheart.
Get up now, motherfucker.
Now!
Get up, you sack of shit.
Oh, fuck me.
Dicks, you'll wanna come take a look at this.
Dicks!
Oof. Jesus.
- 'Victor?' - 'What the hell?'
'Yeah, it's just Victor.'
'Yeah, it's just Victor.' - Call an ambulance. - What the fuck is this?
- Hearse would be more like it. - Also Forensics. - What's goin' on here? - California!
- What's goin' on here? - California! - Get your people out of here. - 'Go on now. Go!'
No one touches anything.
It's some kind of friggin' wax sculpture or somethin'.
"Sloth."
(Mills) 'Oh, man.'
'Goddamn.'
(Somerset) These pictures were dated three days ago.
This must be the first one. Look.
It's dated exactly one year ago today.
I got a hair sample, I got a stool sample I got piss, I got fingernails.
He's laughin' at us. You got what you deserved.
(Mills) 'He's alive, he's alive!'
- 'That cocksucker's alive!' - 'Guns down.'
- 'Still breathing!' - Guns down!
Emergency on that ambulance!
Coming through.
He's playin' games. Ah, no shit.
Look, we have to divorce ourselves from emotion here.
No matter how hard it is, we have to remain focused--
Hey, man, I feed off my emotions.
- How's that? - Are you listening to me? Yes, I can hear you.
- Excuse me. - Hey, what are you doin'?
Closed crime scene, get out fuck out of here. I got a right to be here.
- UPI photographer-- - Get out.
Hey, I got a fuckin' right to be here.
- Get out of here. - Fuckin' jerk. - Jesus. - Fuck you!
- I got your picture, man. - Oh, yeah?
- 'I got your picture.' - Oh, yeah?
Detective Mills, M-I-L-L-S, fuck off!
- 'I'm surprised you can spell.' - Fuck you!
How do they get here so fucking quick?
They pay police for the information.
And they pay well.
Hey, man, I'm sorry, I-I..
Those, ugh..
- They piss me off. - It's okay.
It's impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions.
(male #13) 'A year of immobility seems about right'
'judging by the deterioration of the muscles and the spine.'
Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his system.
Even an antibiotic, which must've been administered
Even an antibiotic, which must've been administered to keep the bed sores from infecting.
Now, has he tried to speak or, or communicate in any way?
Even if his brain were not mush, which it is
he chewed off his own tongue long ago.
Uh, doc.
Is there absolutely no chance that he might survive?
Detective, he'd die of shock right now
if you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes.
He's experienced about as much pain and suffering as anyone I've encountered, give or take.
as anyone I've encountered, give or take.
And he still has hell to look forward to.
Goodnight.
(man on radio) 'Tonight we bring you' 'the Charlie Parker Quintet.'
'Featuring, Sir Charles Thompson on piano' 'Herb Pomeroy's trumpet'
'Jimmy Woode, bass, Kenny Clarke, drums'
'and the alto saxophone of Charlie Parker.'
- Yeah? - 'Hello, William? It's Tracy.'
- Yeah? - 'Hello, William? It's Tracy.' Tracy? Is everything alright?
Tracy? Is everything alright? 'Yeah, yes, everything's fine.'
- Where's David? - 'He's just, uh..'
'He's in the other room. He's in the shower.'
'Um, I'm sorry to call you like this.'
Oh, it's alright. Um.. What can I do for you, Tracy?
I, uh..
Um, heh. I need someone to talk to.
I need someone to talk to. Do you think you could meet me somewhere
maybe tomorrow morning?
I don't understand.
'I feel stupid calling, but, uh..'
...you're the only person that I know here.
There's no one else.
'If you can, just, uh, give me a call, okay?'
'I have to go now.'
- 'Well, goodnight.' - Goodnight.
(Tracy) I mean, you know this city so well.
You've been here so long.
It can be a hard place.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Why don't you talk to him about it?
Tell him how you feel.
I can't. You know, I can't be a burden.
Especially now.
I'll get used to things.
You know? I think I just..
I wanted to talk to someone who's lived here for a long time and..
I mean, upstate, you know it's a completely different environment.
Did David tell you that I teach fifth grade?
Well, I did.
Uh, he mentioned it.
I've been going around, you know, looking at schools.
But the conditions here are horrible.
What about private schools?
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you, Tracy.
David and I are gonna have a baby.
Oh, Tracy, I..
I don't think I'm the, heh..
...I'm the one to talk to about this.
I hate this city.
I had a relationship once.
It was very much like a marriage.
We got pregnant.
This was a long time ago.
I remember getting up one morning and going to work.
Just another day like any other except it was the first day after I knew about..
...the pregnancy.
And I felt this fear for the first time ever.
I remember thinkin'.. ...how can I bring a child into a world like this?
How can.. How can a person grow up with all this around them?
I told her I didn't want to have it.
And over the next few weeks..
...I wore her down.
I wanna have children.
I can tell you now that..
I'm.. I know, I mean..
I'm positive that I made the right decision.
But there's not a day that passes
that I don't wish that I had made a different choice.
If you don't keep..
...the baby, I mean, if that's your decision..
...don't ever tell him that you were pregnant.
But if you choose to have this baby..
...you spoil that kid every chance you get.
That's about all the advice I can give you, Tracy.
I got to go.
William.
Thank you.
(Somerset) 'Victor's landlord said there was an envelope of cash'
in the office mailbox the first of every month.
Quote, "I never heard a single complaint
Quote, "I never heard a single complaint "from the tenant in Apartment 306.
'"And nobody ever complained about him.'
He's the best tenant I've ever had," end quote.
Yeah, a landlord's dream.
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.
Who pays the rent on time.
I'm sick of all this waiting. This is the job.
Why aren't we out there, huh?
W-why, why do we gotta sit here rotting waiting till the lunatic does it again?
It's dismissive to call him a lunatic. Don't make that mistake.
Come on, he's insane. Look.
Right now, he's probably dancing around i-in his, in his grandma's panties.
'Yeah, rubbing himself in peanut butter. Ooh.'
How's that? I don't think so.
His luck will run out.
He's not depending on luck.
We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he tied Victor to the bed.
One year to the day. He wanted us to.
One year to the day. He wanted us to. Don't know that for sure.
Oh, yes, we do.
This note he left.
His first words to us.
"Long is the way and hard, that out of Hell leads up to light."
Fuck him. So what?
He's right so far.
Imagine the will it takes to keep a man bound for a full year.
To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.
'To insert tubes into his genitals.'
This guy is methodical, exacting and worst of all, patient.
He's a nut bag.
And just because the, the fucker's got a library card doesn't make him Yoda.
How much money do you got? I got like 50. 50 bucks.
I propose a field trip. Come on.
We'll make a list.
At the top, we'll put "Purgatory" "Canterbury Tales."
Anything relating to the seven deadly sins.
- Ask yourself-- - Hey, wait, wait.
What would he study to do the things he's done?
What are his interests now?
Jack the Ripper, for instance.
- Where are we going? - 'Library.'
Coupons, coupons, free coupons.
Discount.. Discount coupons.
They must've had about 50 health violations
during the last inspection.
Could you at least sit across from me? I don't want people thinkin' we're dating.
Give me your money.
I'm giving you this, but for some strange reason I think I don't know what the fuck we're doin'.
Fuck.
- Hey, Somerset, how you doin'? - Okay.
Didn't figure this was gonna be a menage a trois. It's not a problem.
Sit down.
Only for you do I do this, so, it's a big risk.
So I figure we're just fair and square.
- It's a deal. - Alright.
About an hour.
Yeah, help yourself.
Well, that was money well spent.
Yeah.
Alright.
By telling you this, though I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
Good, 'cause I'm about ready to punch you.
It's probably nothin', but even if it is it's no skin off our teeth.
The guy in the pizza parlor is a friend from the Bureau.
Who, stinky man?
See, for years the FBI's been hooked into the library system keeping records.
- Mm-hm. Assessing fines? - No, monitoring reading habits.
- Look. - What?
Certain books are flagged.
Books on, say, nuclear weapons and, well, "Mein Kampf."
Anyone who checks out a flagged book..
...has his library records fed into the FBI's computers from then on.
Wait, wait, wait, how is this legal?
Oh, legal, illegal. These terms don't apply.
- Oh. - You..
You can't use the information directly. It's just a useful guide.
It might sound silly, but you can't get a library card
without, uh, an ID and a current phone bill, see?
- So they run a list. - Precisely.
If you wanna know who's reading Purgatory and Paradise Lost and Helter Skelter
and Paradise Lost and Helter Skelter the FBI's computers will tell us.
- It could give us a name. - It could.
Could get a name of some college kid
writing a term paper on 20th-century crime.
At least you're out of the office.
Get a haircut.
- How do you know all this? - I don't.
- Neither do you. - Exactly.
"The Divine Comedy." "History Of Catholicism."
There's a book called "Murderers And Madmen."
"Modern Homicide Investigation," "In Cold Blood."
"Of Human Bondage." Bondage?
- Not what you think. - Okay.
"The Marquis De Sade."
- It's "The Marquis De Sade." - Whatever.
"The Writings Of Saint Thomas Aqua.." Something.
Saint Thomas Aquinas. There it is.
He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
- Is that it? - Yeah.
- Let's try it. - Jonathan Doe?
Whatever.
We're sure about that name, are we? Yeah.
You saw, John Doe?
You wanna go back? I'll go back.
Let's take a look at him. Talk to him.
This is crazy.
- Ah, we'll just talk to him. - Uh-huh.
"Excuse me, sir. Are you by any chance a serial killer?"
Okay.
You do the talkin'.
Put that silver tongue of yours to work.
No. You been talkin' to my wife?
This is retarded.
Charlie's Fuckin' Angels.
'A name off a computer.'
Mills.
Fuck!
- You hit? - No.
He's going down, he's going down!
Fifth floor.
Mills.
(girl #1) 'Mommy?'
'Mommy?'
Police. Is there a back way out?
Lock your door.
What the hell is going on, man? Get out of the fuckin' hall, please!
- Get down. - Aah!
Hey!
Get the fuck down.
Aah! Shit.
Get the fuck out of there.
(male #14) 'Hey! Shut the fuck up!'
Goddamn it!
Get out of the fuckin' way! Move!
Mills?
No.
Mills.
Mills, you okay? I'm alright.
I'm alright.
- Where are you goin'? - I'm going in.
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
- Wait. - What are you talkin' about?
- He fuckin' shot at us. - You can't go in there.
- The hell we can't. - We need a warrant.
We got probable cause. Come on.
- Think about it, think. - We got probable cause. How did we get here? Huh? I can't tell anyone about this.
How did we get here? Huh? I can't tell anyone about this. Oh, come on, get out of the way. Get out of the way.
Oh, come on, get out of the way. Get out of the way.
We have no reason to be here.
Will you listen to me? Listen to me!
- Listen! - Get off! Get the fuck off me!
Alright, alright, alright, I'm sorry.
But would you just pay attention a minute?
If we leave a hole like this, we won't be able to prosecute.
The fucking guy will walk. Now, is that what you want?
By the time we clear a warrant, someone else.. No, fuck that.
We need a reason to knock on this door.
Think about it.
Okay?
Okay, man. Okay.
You're right. I'm all fucked up.
When you're right, you're right.
Well, no point in arguin' anymore.
Unless you can fix that.
You stupid son of a..
How much money we got left?
So, yeah, like, I noticed this guy going out a lot
when the murders was happenin', so I, um.. So..
when the murders was happenin', so I, um.. So.. So you called Detective Somerset, right?
Yeah, right, right, so I called the detective because this guy was lookin' creepy and shit.
'And-and, and one of the murders' it-it, it happened right over there.
Okay, okay, okay. I told you the rest. You got it?
- You good? Everything? - Got your story.
- Have her sign. You gotta sign. - Okay.
Okay?
- Good, good, good. - Alright. You did good.
- I did what you said. - Here you go.
You get somethin' to eat, alright? You eat.
Everybody, stay outside.
Victor.
Somerset!
Somerset! Yeah?
- What? - We had him.
What are you talkin' about?
The fuckin' photographer in the fuckin' stairs.
We had him and we let him go.
You're sure this is him?
Yup, good, good. Yup.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good, get it out.
Alright. You know, we've got nothin' to go on here. No pay stubs, no appointment books, no addresses.
- This is the best we got. - You guys keep lookin'?
Yeah, wait, let me show you something. This was under the bed. Uh, his only source of funds.
This was under the bed. Uh, his only source of funds.
No kidding, we got his money. Fuckin' A, I like it.
Yeah, wait, a-and there's one more thing
and you're probably not gonna believe this. We haven't found a fingerprint yet.
Um, not a single one. You're right, I don't believe you. Keep looking.
We could use some more men here.
Hey, man, I'm doing the best I can. 'What are you getting with all this?'
There are 2000 notebooks on these shelves.
And each notebook contains about 250 pages.
Forget it. Anything about the killings?
"What sick ridiculous puppets we are "and what a gross, little stage we dance on.
"What fun we have dancing and fucking. "Not a care in the world.
"Not knowing that we are nothing.
We are not what was intended."
No, wait, there's a lot more.
"On the subway today, a man came up to me "to start a conversation.
"He made small talk, a lonely man '"talking about the weather and other things.'
"I tried to be pleasant and accommodating.
"But my head began to hurt from his banality.
"I almost didn't notice it had happened "but I suddenly threw up all over him.
He was not pleased. And I couldn't stop laughing."
No dates.
Placed on the shelves in no discernible order.
Just his mind poured out on paper.
Looks like a life's work.
If we had 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts
If we had 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts it'd still take two months.
I know, I know, I know.
Where's that phone?
Phone? Phone?
Phone?
People, quiet.
- Hello? - 'I admire you.'
(John Doe) 'I don't know how you found me, but imagine my surprise. I..'
'I respect you law enforcement agents more every day.'
Well, I appreciate that, John.
- I tell you-- - 'No, no. You listen, alright?'
'I'll be re-adjusting my schedule' 'in light of today's little setback.'
'I just had to call and express my admiration.'
'Sorry I had to hurt one of you' 'but I didn't really have a choice, did I?'
'You will accept my apology, won't you?'
'I feel like saying more, but I don't wanna ruin the surprise.'
(John Doe on tape) '...adjusting my schedule after today's little setback.'
Got it.
Alright, everybody, back to work.
- You were right. - Hmm?
- Ugh, he's preaching. - Yeah.
These murders are his sermons to us.
Look, we know him, we know him, we know him.
Who's the blonde?
Looks like a pro.
Maybe.
She caught John Doe's eye.
(male #15) 'Yeah, he finally collected it last night.'
- Last night? - Yeah.
- This man? - Yeah, John Doe.
It's an easy name to remember. He had a limp.
What was this job you did for him? I've got a picture of it. Hang on.
One sweet piece, actually.
I thought he was one of them performance artists that's what I thought.
You know, the sort of guy that pisses in a cup on stage and, uh, and then drinks it.
- Performance art. - Hmm.
I think I undercharged him, actually.
You made this for him?
Yeah, I've made weirder shit than that, so what?
They found the blonde.
The picture.
The picture!
Fucking pigs.
- We need you to move, pal. - I'll come out, but you guys..
(male #16) 'Get the fuck off out of the booth!' I've been in this cage the whole time!
I've been in this cage the whole time! - 'Okay! Okay!' - 'I'm not fucking with you!'
Come on, this way.
Can you do something about this music?
Yeah, we're working on it. We're looking for the guy.
You from Homicide? You..
- You better see this. - 'Yeah. Alright.'
Hey, easy. Got him?
(male #17) 'Get this thing off of me.'
Oh, God, get this thing off of me!
Get this thing off of me!
- Get this off! - Get him out of here, now.
Get him out of here, now!
Come on, I wanna hear it again.
- Tell me again. - Just.. I don't know.
You heard nothing strange, you saw nothing strange.
- No. - No.
He asked me if I was married.
And I-I could see he had a gun in his hand.
- Where was the girl? - The what? What?
The girl, the prostitute. Where was she?
Someone comes to your establishment
they wanna go downstairs and wanna get a little ooh-la-la.. Whatever.
and wanna get a little ooh-la-la.. Whatever.
- They got to come to you, yeah? - Yeah.
You didn't see anyone?
With a package? A knapsack? Something under their arm?
Hey, everybody that comes in there has got a package under their arms.
Some guys are carrying suitcases full of stuff.
She was just, she was just sitting on the bed.
Who tied her down? You or him?
Do you like what you do for a living?
- These things you see? - No.
No, I don't.
But that's life, isn't it?
(male #17) 'H-h-he had a gun and, and..' He made it h-h-happen.
He made me do it.
H-h-he put that thing on me.
'And, and, and he made me wear it.'
Then h-h-he told me to fuck her.
And I did. I-I-I fucked her.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. He had a gun in my mouth.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. He had a gun in my mouth. T-t-the fucking gun was in my throat!
(male #17 on tape) 'Fuck!'
'Oh, God, God. God, help me.'
'Oh, God, God. God, help me.' 'Please, please, help me. Please, please, help me.'
'Please, please, help me. Please, please, help me.'
You know, this isn't gonna have a happy ending.
- It's not possible. - Hey, man. If we catch him, I'll be happy enough.
If we catch John Doe and he turns out to be the devil
I mean, if he's Satan himself that might live up to our expectations
but...he's not the devil.
He's just a man.
You know..
See, you bitch and you complain, and you tell me these things. These..
If you think you're preparing me for hard times.. ...thank you, but..
But you gotta be a, a hero.
You wanna be a champion. Well, let me tell you, people don't want a champion.
They wanna eat cheeseburgers play the lotto and watch television.
Hey, how did you get like this?
- I wanna know. - Ah.
It wasn't one thing, I can tell you that.
Go on.
I just don't think I can continue to live in a place that embraces and nurtures apathy
that embraces and nurtures apathy
as if it was a virtue.
You're no different, you're no better.
I didn't say I was different or better, I'm not.
Hell, I sympathize. I sympathize completely.
Apathy is a solution.
I mean, it is, it's easier to lose yourself in drugs than it is to cope with life.
in drugs than it is to cope with life. It's easier to steal what you want than it is to, to earn it.
It's easier to steal what you want than it is to, to earn it.
It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it.
Hell, love costs. It takes effort and work.
We are talking about people who are mentally ill.
We are talking about people, fucking crazies.
- No. No, we're not. No! No! - 'Yes, today.'
We're, we're talking about everyday life here.
Wait, wait. You-you-you can't afford to be this naive.
Fuck off.
See, you-you should listen to yourself. Yeah.
You say.. ...that the problem with people is that they don't care.
So I don't care about people.
It makes no sense. You know why?
- Uh, you, you care? - You wanna know.. Damn right.
- Uh, you, you care? - You wanna know.. Damn right. And you're gonna make a difference?
Whatever, the point is.. ...is that, I don't think you're quitting
because you believe these things you say. I don't.
I think you wanna believe them because you're quitting.
You want me to agree with you and you want me to say "Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.
"It's all fucked up. It's a fucking mess.
We should all go live in a fuckin' log cabin."
But I won't.
I won't say that.
I don't agree with you. I do not.
I can't.
I'm gonna go home.
Thank you, though.
I love you, honey.
So much.
So much.
I know.
911 , what's your emergency?
'Could you repeat that?' (John Doe) 'I've gone and done it again.'
What have we got?
Uh, sleeping pills.
Glued to one hand.
'Telephone glued to the other.'
You see what he did?
He sliced her up.
Then he bandaged her.
Call for help and you'll live.
But you'll be disfigured.
Or you can put yourself out of your own misery.
Come on.
Cut off her nose.
To spite her face.
And he did it very recently.
(Somerset) Listen.
I've decided to stay on till this is done. I figure one of two things will happen.
Either we'll get John Doe or he'll finish his series of seven
or he'll finish his series of seven and this case will go on for years.
Hey, man, you don't have to do me any favors. (Mills) Thank you, but I--
I'm requesting that you keep me on as your partner for a few more days.
You'd be doing me a favor.
You knew I'd say yes.
- Hey, we're here. - 'Wonderful.'
Your wife called before. Get yourself an answering machine.
(John Doe) Detective?
- After this, I'm gone. - 'Detective.'
- No big surprise. - Detective!
You're looking for me.
- Hey! - Aah! Don't you fucking move. - 'On the fucking floor.' - Keep, keep away from him!
- 'On the fucking floor.' - Keep, keep away from him!
- On the fucking floor! - I know you.
Now! Get down!
'Get down! On your stomach, you piece of shit.'
Now. All the way!
All the way, fucker! Down!
Faster! Faster! Faster, fucker!
'Now. Nose on the ground.'
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?
I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please.
Goddamn it.
(male #5) 'He cuts the skin off the tips of his fingers.
'That's why we couldn't find one single' 'usable print in his apartment.'
'Looks like he's been doin' it for quite some time.'
(Mills) 'What about the trace on his bank accounts? And the guns?'
(male #5) 'So far everything's a dead end.'
'No credit history. No employment records.'
'His bank account's only five years old' 'and it was started with cash.'
'We're even tryin' to trace his furniture.'
About the only thing we know about that guy right now
is he's independently wealthy, well-educated 'and totally insane.'
Because he's John Doe by choice.
Okay, so when do we get to question him? You don't. He goin' to court now.
You don't. He goin' to court now.
I'm telling you, there's no way he would just
'turn himself in, it doesn't make any sense.'
Well, there he sits. It's not supposed to make any sense.
He's not finished. No, he's just pissing in our faces.
We're just taking it like idiots. You know what I'm talkin' about.
For the first time ever you and I are in total agreement.
He wouldn't just stop. (Mills) 'So, what the fuck, man?'
(Somerset) 'He's two murders away from completing his masterpiece.'
We'll wait for his plea.
My client says there are two more bodies. Two more victims hidden away.
He will take Detectives Mills and Somerset to these bodies
but only Detectives Mills and Somerset 'only at 6 o'clock today.'
Why us?
He says he admires you.
It's part of the game.
My client claims that if the detectives do not accept this offer, these two bodies will never be found.
do not accept this offer, these two bodies will never be found. Frankly, counselor, I'm inclined to let them rot.
Eh-h, h-h-hey.
We've got him.
Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.
He's gonna get his free room and board 'he's gonna get his free cable TV.'
Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable. Why are we having these conversations? Mills!
Why are we having these conversations? Mills! No. Hey, somethin' stinks.
And this one here, and his three.. Yeah, you.
And this one here, and his three.. Yeah, you. In your $3000 suit and that smug smile on your face
dealing for that piece of shit. - 'I don't like--' - Mills.
I am required by law to serve my clients to the best of my abilities..
Aw, Jesus Christ.
...and to serve their best interest. We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.
My client also wishes inform you that if you do not accept
he will plead insanity across the board.
(Martin) 'Let him try it.'
- I'd like to see him try. - Come on, now, Martin.
- I'd like to see him try. - Come on, now, Martin. We all know with the extreme nature of these crimes
I could get him off with such a plea.
I'm not letting this conviction slide. I can tell you that.
He says that if you do accept under his specific conditions
he will sign a full confession, plead guilty right now.
It's your case. Make a decision.
Full confession.
- I'm in. - It has to be the both of you.
If he were to claim insanity this conversation is admissible.
The fact that he's blackmailing us with his plea.
And my client would like to remind you two more are dead.
The press would have a field day if they were find out
The press would have a field day if they were find out the police didn't seem too concerned about finding them.
'Giving them a proper burial.' If in fact there are two more dead.
(Martin) 'Lab report came up from downtown.' They did a quickie on Doe's clothing and finger nails.
'They found blood from Doe.' From him slicing his fingers.
'Blood from the woman who's face he cut off.'
And blood from a third party as yet unidentified.
You'd be escorting an unarmed man.
Let's finish it.
(Somerset) 'If John Doe's head splits open' 'and a UFO should fly out'
'I want you to have expected it.'
I will.
Hey, man, if I was to accidentally shave off a nipple
would it be covered by workman's comp?
- I suppose so. - Yeah.
- I suppose so. - Yeah. If you were man enough to actually file a claim
If you were man enough to actually file a claim I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.
If I keep coming home late, my wife's gonna think something's up.
You know..
Yeah?
What?
Let's go.
(male #18 on radio) 'Proceed Victor-5-5 take. Clear the TC.'
Pull around.
'There it is, late-model black sedan' 'at your 10 o'clock.'
Who are you, John?
- 'Who are you really?' - What do you mean?
All I mean at this stage, what harm can it do to tell us a bit about yourself?
It doesn't matter who I am who I am means absolutely nothing.
You need to stay on your left up here.
So where are we headin'?
You'll see.
We're not just going to pick up two more dead bodies, are we, John?
That wouldn't be shocking enough.
'We've got newspapers to think about, yeah?'
Wanting people to listen..
...you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore.
You have to hit them with a sledgehammer.
And then you'll notice you've got their strict attention.
(Mills) 'But the question is'
is what makes you so special that people should listen?
I'm not special.
(John Doe on radio) 'I've never been exceptional.'
'This is, though, what I'm doing.' 'My work.'
- Your work, John? - Yes.
See, I-I don't, I-I don't see anything special about it, John.
- That's not true. - No, it is true.
And the funny thing is, all this work
two months from now, no one's gonna care.
No one's gonna give a shit, and no one's gonna remember.
You can't see the whole complete act yet.
But when this is done..
'...when it's finished..'
'...it's going to be..'
People will barely be able to comprehend.
But they won't be able to deny.
Could the freak be any more vague?
'I mean, as far as master plans go, John--'
I can't wait for you to see. I really can't. It's really going to be something.
Well, you know what? I'm gonna be standing right next to you.
So when this big thing happens you be sure and let me know.
'Cause I wouldn't wanna miss it. (John Doe) 'Oh, don't worry. You won't.'
(John Doe) 'Oh, don't worry. You won't.'
You won't miss a thing.
(male #18 on radio) 'With the tour bus itself' 'give two miles separation.' (male #19 on radio) 'Uh, Roger..'
What's so exciting?
It's not too far now.
(male #18 on radio) 'High-tension lines ahead.' 'Prepare for frequency change.'
I've been trying to figure somethin' in my head.
And maybe you can help me out, yeah?
When a person is insane as you clearly are..
...do you know that you're insane?
Maybe you're just sitting around, reading "Guns And Ammo"
masturbating in your own feces 'do you just stop and go..'
"Wow, it is amazing how fucking crazy I really am?"
'Yeah? Do you guys do that?'
It's more comfortable for you to label me insane.
It's very comfortable.
It's not something I would expect you to accept.
But I did not choose. - I was chosen. - 'Well, whatever.'
- I was chosen. - 'Well, whatever.' I don't doubt that you believe that, John.
But seems to me that you're overlooking 'a glaring contradiction.'
Meaning what?
Glad you asked.
If you were chosen..
...that is, by a higher power..
...and if your hand was forced..
...seems strange to me that you'd get such enjoyment out of it.
'You enjoyed torturin' those people.'
'This doesn't seem in keeping with martyrdom, does it?'
John?
I doubt I enjoyed it any more than Detective Mills would enjoy time alone with me
than Detective Mills would enjoy time alone with me 'in a room without windows.'
Isn't that true?
How happy would it make you to hurt me with impunity.
That hurts my feelings. I would never--
That hurts my feelings. I would never-- You wouldn't only because there's consequences.
'It's in those eyes of yours, though.'
Nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.
'I won't deny my own personal desire' to turn each sin against the sinner.
Wait a minute, I thought all you did was kill innocent people.
Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny?
(John Doe) An obese man.
A disgusting man who could barely stand up.
A man if you saw him on the street you'd point him out to your friends so that
they could join you in mocking him.
A man, who if you saw him while you were eating
you wouldn't be able to finish your meal.
And after him, I picked the lawyer. And you both must have secretly been thanking me for that one.
'This is a man who dedicated his life'
to making money by lying with every breath that he could muster
to keeping murderers and rapists on the streets.
- Murderers? - A woman.
- Murderers, John, like yourse-- - A woman!
So ugly on the inside that she couldn't bear to go on living
if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside?
A d-drug dealer. A d-drug dealing pederast, actually.
And let's not forget the disease-spreading whore.
Only in a world this shitty..
...could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.
But that's the point.
We see a deadly sin on every street corner
in every home, and we tolerate it.
'We tolerate it because it's common, it's..'
'...it's trivial.'
We tolerate it morning, noon and night.
Well, not anymore.
I'm setting the example.
And what I've done is gonna be
puzzled over..
...and studied..
...and followed..
...forever.
Yeah.
Delusions of grandeur.
You should be thanking me.
Why's that, John?
Because you're going to be remembered after this.
Realize, detective the only reason that I'm here right now
'is that I wanted to be.'
No. No, we would've got you eventually.
Oh, really?
So, what were you doing, biding your time? Toying with me?
Allowing five innocent people to die until you felt like springing your trap?
'Tell me, what was the indisputable evidence' 'you were going to use on me'
right before I walked up to you and put my hands in the air?
John, calm down.
I seem to remember us knocking on your door.
Oh, that's right.
And I seem to remember breaking your face.
You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
Okay, sit back. - I spared you. - Sit back.
- I spared you. - Sit back.
Remember that, detective every time you look in the mirror
every time you look in the mirror at that face of yours for the rest of your life
or should I say, for the rest of what life..
or should I say, for the rest of what life.. - 'Sit back.' - I've allowed you to have.
Sit back, you fucking freak! 'Shut your fucking mouth!'
You're no messiah, you're, you're a movie of the week.
You're a fucking T-shirt, at best.
Don't ask me to pity those people.
I don't mourn them any more than I do
the thousands that died at Sodom and Gomorrah.
Is that to say, John, that what you were doing was God's good work?
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
'Do you see those high-tension towers?'
- 'That's where we're headed.' - 'Yeah.' 'I see where he's talkin' about, right to your 9 o'clock'
'I see where he's talkin' about, right to your 9 o'clock' 'and follow that access road.'
(male #18 on radio) 'Your signal's breaking up, Viking.'
(male #19 on radio) 'Un-fucking-avoidable, center.' 'We're in power-line city, deal with it.'
There's sure as shit is no ambush out here.
No fucking nothing out here. Can't land anywhere near those wires.
Look, they're gonna be coming up behind us in about two minutes.
I want you to go up, way up.
Thirty seconds, bank east on my mark. Thirty seconds.
I'm gettin' him out.
(male #18 on radio) 'Target is now fully into standby.'
'Got you in sight.'
(Mills) Get out.
Slowly.
Stop.
'Stay.'
What do you got?
Dead dog.
I didn't do that.
(male #18 on radio) 'We're holding on standby, copy?'
What time is it?
- Why? - I'd like to know.
7:01.
It's close.
Let's go take a look.
It's this way.
(male #18 on radio) 'Bird 2, close your distance.'
(male #19 on radio) 'This is Bird 2. They're moving away from the car.'
'Coming in closer.'
'We got them. We got them. Closing in.'
(male #18 on radio) 'Uh, that's a negative. Negative. Hold your go.'
Mills?
Down, down, down.
Watch him.
There he goes.
(John Doe) It's good we have some time to talk.
(male #18 on radio) 'Van approaching.'
Stay on the guy in red, do not take the crosshairs off the guy in red.
There's a van coming down the road. 'From the north.'
Be ready for anything, now. Wait for my signal.
Wait for me.
Get out of the van!
(Somerset) Out! Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot me.
Step away.
Turn around. Put your hands on your head.
What the hell is going on?
(Somerset) Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm just deliverin' a package, man.
I got this package for this guy, David.
Uh, Detective David Mills.
Get it. Slowly.
(male #18 on radio) 'Stay alert. He's opening the back of the van.'
'We've got him in sight.'
This guy paid me 500 bucks to bring it out here, man.
He said he wanted it here at exactly 7 o'clock.
Put it down.
(Somerset) We got a box.
We got a box. Call the bomb squad. I need a bomb squad. We got a box.
(Somerset) Face the van.
Hands up.
Turn around.
Okay. Go. Off you go. Go!
I'm sending the driver out on foot.
He's headed north along the road. Have him picked up.
Oh, I don't know.
I'm gonna open it.
When I said I admired you I meant what I said.
There's blood.
(John Doe) 'You've made quite a life' for yourself, detective. Hmm.
You should be very proud. Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.
California, stay away from here. Stay away from here, now.
California, stay away from here. Stay away from here, now. Don-don-don't come in here.
Whatever you hear, stay away.
John Doe has the upper hand. Mills!
- Here he comes. - 'Throw your gun down!'
- Here he comes. - 'Throw your gun down!' What?
I wish I could've lived like you. - Shut up. - 'Throw it away.'
The fuck you talkin' about? (Somerset) 'Gun! Throw away!'
Do you hear me, detective?
'I'm trying to tell you how much' I admire you and your pretty wife.
- What? - Tracy.
- 'Mills!' - What'd you fuckin' say?
It's disturbing how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
What the fuck?
(Somerset) Throw your gun down!
(John Doe) I visited your home this morning.
After you'd left.
- 'Mills!' - I tried to play husband.
'I tried to taste the life of a simple man.'
Throw it away!
It didn't work out.
So..
...I took a souvenir.
Her pretty head.
(Somerset) Mills.
What's the fuck is he talking about?
Give me your gun. What's goin' on over there?
Put the, gu.. Put the gun down.
I saw you with a box. What was in the box?
Because I envy your normal life.. Put the gun down, David.
...it seems that envy is my sin. Oh, what's in the box?
- Not until you give me the gun. - What's in the fucking box?
- 'Give me the gun.' - He just told you.
You lie! You're a fucking liar! Shut up!
That's what he wants. He wan.. He wants you to shoot him.
No! No.
You tell me, you tell me that's not true.
- 'That's not true.' - Become vengeance, David.
No, she's alright. You tell me. Become...wrath.
Become...wrath. Tell me she's alright!
If you murder a suspect, David.. No!
'...you'll just throw it all away.' - 'And he knows it.' - No!
She begged for her life, detective.
- Shut up! Shut up. - She begged for her life. And for the life of the baby inside of her. Shut up!
He didn't know.
Give me the gun, David.
'David.'
If you kill him..
'...he will win.'
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, fuck, he shot him!
(male #19 on radio) 'Set it down somewhere.'
'Come on, set us down.'
'Holy Christ. Somebody call somebody.'
'Call somebody.'
Well, we'll take care of him.
Whatever he needs.
Where are you gonna be?
Around.
I'll be around.
(Somerset) Ernest Hemingway once wrote
Two of the horses run off,
but that pinto you're riding hung around.
You got no idea what they were after?
Nope.
Offend anybody lately?
Not for five years.
Jefferson City?
No. Leavenworth.
Never been in there.
They just jumped you out of the blue?
I had to get up anyway.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business.
Four cowboys come by,
and we decide to ride together for a while,
friendly as can be.
I always figure, you might as well approach life
I always figure, you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is.
Don't make much difference.
Got in the middle of that frying pan,
and suddenly, everybody's pointing their gun but me.
Guess they admired my horse.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
Yep.
The whole rig.
I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay.
At least they didn't kill me.
That was right considerate, I thought.
They were laughing when they left me.
Thought it was real funny.
I walked for a little while, but it was no use,
so I gave it up.
Figured it was just bad luck.
Well, looks like those boys are headed south,
so they weren't the same ones that jumped me.
Where you going?
Where's the pinto going?
I'll get these horses tended to.
I'm good for it.
Just a minute there, fella.
When I'm done helping the lady, I'll come up here...
I'll take this one.
This one is $20.
How much to borrow it?
The guns are for sale.
All right, what can I get for that?
Look, Ma.
This is the man, Sergeant.
He claims the animal was stolen.
I know.
Yeah.
How do I know this is your horse?
Can't you see this horse loves me?
I had a gal do that to me. It didn't make her my wife.
I'll tell you what. On the underside of that saddle,
I'll tell you what. On the underside of that saddle, I got my name scratched.
Take a look and you'll see.
And what would your name be?
MAN: Paden.
P-A-D-E-N.
Hello, Cobb.
Hello, Paden.
How you doing?
You know this man, Cobb?
I surely do.
Troopers, let's take a look at this saddle.
All right.
Move along, folks.
Get these children out of here,
and you...
Get some clothes on.
I see you've been prospering without me.
It's been a while.
Where's the dog?
PADEN: Appreciate the loan.
I'm good for it.
Well, let's talk about that.
I'm looking for some men.
I've given that up.
So have I.
I got a legitimate job now.
I could use a guy like you.
You've got a legitimate job?
Yes, sir, I do. You wouldn't believe it.
You're right.
Ah, this is mighty sweet, Paden.
I think I finally found my place in the world.
Well, I'm
real happy for you, Cobb,
but I think I'll just keep looking for mine.
He's getting out.
Come on, Paden.
This ought to interest you.
COBB: Hey, look who's here, Tyree.
Our old riding buddy.
I... I invited Paden to join us,
but he's not having any.
Where's the dog?
You owe me $13.
Thirteen.
Bad luck.
I see what you like.
She's mighty pretty.
Yeah, and bridle-wise too.
The only thing I lost I really cared about...
Except for maybe my hat.
It's a great one.
Black with a pretty silver band on it.
My head spent three years training it.
Sure do miss that hat.
All right, I got to be going.
Going to Turley, was it?
Yeah. Yeah, I've got to stop off there,
Yeah. Yeah, I've got to stop off there, meet a guy, head out for Silverado.
What's Turley like?
Well...
It's a town.
Got a saloon?
I expect.
Women?
I expect.
Baxter, Hawley, where the hell you been?
You're late, and I tell you, I don't like it.
It's a bad start, boys.
I got my people down there throwing snowballs and raring to go.
throwing snowballs and raring to go. Well, I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend,
'cause my name ain't Baxter, he ain't Hawley.
You're not Baxter?
Name's Emmett.
You're not Baxter either?
No, I'm not Hawley.
God damn it.
God damn it! They ain't Baxter and Hawley!
Where the hell is Baxter and Hawley?
Quit your yelling, you old coot.
We're right here.
HOBART: Who you calling a coot?
Calm down, Mr. Hobart.
I'm Nord Baxter.
That there's my partner, Tom Hawley.
You're late. It's a bad start, boys.
Yes, sir. That means we'll just have to get you people to Silverado that much quicker. All right, let's get going.
that much quicker. All right, let's get going.
You remember my letter, don't you, Mr. Hobart?
Half now and half when we get there.
Yeah, I remember, I remember. Open the box, Eb.
Thank you.
Don't you even want to count it?
Not at all, friend.
We trust you.
Let's get this wagon train on its way to Silverado.
You bet.
What do you want?
I haven't had a drink of whiskey or slept in a bed in 10 days.
Give me a bottle.
Hey. What are you doing, Buck?
Having a drink.
No, you're not. Get out of here.
I haven't had a drink of whiskey or slept in bed in 10 days.
You ain't getting it here.
I'm real sorry to hear that.
Doesn't look quite fair.
Which way do you mean?
(ENGLISH ACCENT) What's all this, then?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
We don't serve 'em here, and you know it.
I ask him to leave, and he went crazy on us.
Now, he owes me money for all this damage.
Is that a fact?
Afraid not, Sheriff.
These other fellas started the ruckus.
Are these your friends?
I wanted a drink and a bed.
I guess I came to the wrong place.
Came to the wrong town.
I don't tolerate this kind of thing.
It's hard on the peace and it's hard on the furniture.
Now, knowing a bit about Carter here,
I'm going to let you go without paying for the damage,
but go you will, and I mean now.
Is there a place in town that takes my kind?
You misunderstand. I want you out of town.
In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
That ain't right.
I decide what's right in this jurisdiction.
Now, move.
Hey, who's going to pay for this, Sheriff?
Don't press your luck, Carter.
Now, let's talk about you chaps.
We'd rather stay.
Well, we'll see about that.
I'm Sheriff John Langston.
As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
You're kidding.
But the good citizens of Turley
have taken me in their embrace and for one simple reason.
I maintain the peace.
So when strangers come to town,
I always ask them their business.
Have you come for the hanging?
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on.
So far, I ain't been able to find him.
SHERIFF: Well, in my town, if you're looking for someone, you ask me.
All right.
He's a young fella, full of juice, about my size,
wears a fancy two-gun rig.
I know where that gentleman is.
Now, I want everyone to behave himself.
Emmett?
Emmett! Howdy, Jake.
JAKE: Oh, I'm glad to see you.
Keep back.
Thank you.
What's going on here?
You got me.
This is a crazy town, Emmett.
I... I think we ought to just get out of here.
I mean, all I did was kiss a girl.
That's why they got you in jail? Yeah.
Yeah, I kissed a girl, and...
And this guy didn't like it. And so then we had some words,
And this guy didn't like it. And so then we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
So I did. I...
I got out of there. You know me, I don't want no trouble.
And so I walked out in the street,
and this fella tries to shoot me in the back.
You had to kill him?
No, I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
You're in here for winging a guy?
No. Not exactly.
Because, see, then his friend opened up on me.
What friend's that?
He was the one with the shotgun.
The dead one.
Jake. Jake.
I'm gonna ask you once.
Was it self-defense?
Honest to God, Emmett. He would have killed me.
The jury saw it differently.
So this is the guy you're gonna hang?
Tomorrow morning, 10:00.
I was afraid of that.
Emmett, can't you help me?
You know the law, Jake.
You know what they did to me.
Blind Pete always said you'd hang.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
SHERIFF: 10:00 a.m.
Oh, right.
I always thought they did it at dawn.
So long, kid.
I'm sorry.
I hate to see any man swing.
I hate to see any man swing. It's bad luck.
Bad luck for me.
Now I got to bust him out of there.
You have to deal me out on that.
I've had some experience with that sort of thing.
I don't want any more of it.
I understand.
It's not going to be easy.
It never is, but...
He's my brother.
We're going to California together, but...
First, we're going to stop off at Silverado,
see our sister, say goodbye.
I can't show up there with a story like this.
Then I guess this is where we part ways.
Sorry.
No hard feelings.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
You ain't got any money.
All right, you buy me a drink.
You know, a good, smelly saloon
You know, a good, smelly saloon is my favorite place in the world.
I see your 50 and raise you 50.
You're wearing my hat.
What else you got that's mine?
Mister, I don't know what you're talking about.
I hope your fingers aren't tickling my ivory-handled Colt.
If you stand up real slow and let me see,
you might live through this night.
Sure.
You're making a big mistake.
That's what I told 'em.
So you mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
We sure are. We're leaving at dawn.
PADEN: I got no reason to run.
It was a fair fight, and there were plenty of witnesses.
(WHISPERING) Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
The other guy drew first.
Right.
(KNOCK ON DOOR) BOY: Sheriff! Sheriff, open up!
Sheriff Langston, come quick!
Lock the door. Don't let anybody in.
Blind Pete used to do this all by...
Touch.
All right, where is he?
He left.
Like hell.
This is the only way out.
I woke up and
he was gone.
All right, kid, come on out.
All right, kid, come on out. I know you're under there.
You, get over here.
Yeah, you. Get over here.
Give me your hands.
JAKE: Did you get him?
(LAUGHS) Thanks for giving me a hand.
Okay.
What now?
We wait.
Let's go.
Hey!
EMMETT: Come on, Jake, let's go!
MAN: Giddap!
MAN: Get them at the river!
(BULLET RICOCHETS) Yikes!
Here's a trick for you, kid.
MAN: Is that them shooting?
No, it's coming from those rocks.
MAN: Well, let's go. He ain't hitting nothing.
You idiot, he's hit everything he's aimed at.
They won't be out of our jurisdiction till they pass Blacktop.
Today my jurisdiction ends here.
Pick up my hat.
Hey, Langston!
10:00!
This a friend of yours?
PADEN: He is now.
JAKE: Who is he?
Oh, a guy who got run out of town.
Just like us.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
Look, Baxter and Hawley killed poor Eb and stole the money box.
They went north and we're going after 'em.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here.
This is bad country,
no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Your next water ain't for three days.
We got no life in Silverado without that money.
Everybody put in. That's our whole stake.
How long they been gone? HOBART: About an hour.
JAKE: I'll go with you, Mal.
Deal me in.
Jake, you know the way out of here.
I want you to get this train moving towards Silverado, and fast.
I'll go with these guys.
You men, stay with your wagons and your families.
Get rolling, keep your eyes peeled.
Wait a minute.
Even if you do get the money, how do we know you'll come back?
Well, if we don't, you can keep my brother.
I'm trusting you, mister.
CONRAD: You trusted Baxter.
I don't plan on letting these men out of my sight.
You know, mister, if I brought a pretty lady like that
You know, mister, if I brought a pretty lady like that into a place like this, I'd stay close.
into a place like this, I'd stay close.
That's none of your business.
Let's get going.
You got a point, Emmett.
Maybe I'd better stay here with her.
All right, let's get turned around and get these wagons rolling!
Come on, everybody rides!
Everybody rides!
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
EMMETT: Anybody got any ideas?
You really did it this time, Nord.
Thank you, boss.
Tom did his part, too.
Coming in!
In a minute. Should I kill him, Mr. Dawson?
I wouldn't do that, if I were you.
You're gonna need every gun when that posse gets here.
Posse? What the hell are you talking about?
Me and my partner robbed a bank in Turley. Headed out with a posse on our tails.
My partner over there caught one a ways back.
I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon.
You're Dawson, ain't you? Tex Larue.
I used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him.
Well, Andy Simms told me
there was a hideout near here, so I headed for it.
Hope you don't mind.
Mind?
You brought a posse to my best hideout,
and you ask me if I mind?
Mister, I don't know any of those names.
You're about to die.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
You don't believe me, ask them two there.
They saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
I seen him there, all right.
I don't know nothing about any bank job.
If you took the bank in Turley, where's the money?
You know, I'd get down if I were you.
They might be up there right now.
No money, huh?
It's in my saddlebags.
I ain't getting out in the open to get it.
(GUNSHOTS)
MAN: Get down!
Stop your firing until you see something!
(GUNSHOTS) If we charge them, they won't stand a chance,
but first we've got to get to them horses.
Horses? What the hell are you talking about?
Cover me!
Brave man.
I think there's only a couple of guys up there,
and this asshole is one of 'em.
EMMETT: Come on!
(EMMETT URGING HORSES) Get that guy!
Keep him from getting the horses!
(MEN EXCLAIMING)
That was some idea of yours.
Next time, you go in.
I knew it.
Now, put that box on my horse.
Mister, you got a lot to learn about people.
They got a place south of Silverado. I guess they done okay.
Good enough, anyway, so that when my mama wrote me last time,
she said they needed my help to work the place.
That was almost nine months ago, she wrote.
The letter took a while to find me,
but when it did, it was just the right time.
Where were you?
Chicago.
Working in the slaughterhouses.
Chicago? You been to Chicago?
Was it wonderful?
No.
Hey, Paden.
Where you been?
I was just...
Checking the...
You know, looking in.
Jeez, Paden, her old man ain't even cold yet.
Looks pretty shallow here. We can just go off, Emmett.
JAKE: Hey, I'll have a swim.
PADEN: Keep moving. Keep moving. Come on.
Pull 'em up.
Yeah. Yeah.
Come along! Come along!
MAL: That's all right. Let 'em go.
The bank's soft on the other side.
Hold. Hold it right there.
Come on.
Let's go.
Well...
This is it, gents.
My mama told me to head through that notch.
Good luck, Mal.
Yeah, maybe we'll see you around sometime.
Yeah. Maybe.
So long.
JAKE: So long, Mal.
Bye.
See you again, ma'am.
I think I'll ride along with the lady here.
Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado.
See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.
I'll see you around.
I'll be around.
Hey, Jake. Let's go.
JAKE: See you in Silverado, Paden.
PADEN: I'll be there.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine.
We'll work them together.
Mine starts right over there.
It's all I've ever wanted.
Pretty land, isn't it?
And a pretty lady.
A lot of men have told me that.
Maybe it's true.
I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Believe it.
They're drawn to me by that, but it never lasts.
Why?
Because they don't like what I want.
What's that?
I want to build something.
Make things grow.
That takes hard work.
A lifetime of it.
That's not why a man comes to a pretty woman.
After a while, I won't be so pretty...
But this land will be.
(SIGHING)
Kate...
Come here.
Hi, J.T.
Jake, how are you?
KATE: Come on, son.
You remember us?
Yeah.
Hi, Augie.
JAKE: It's good to be home, Kate.
Daddy?
I saw the light.
I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me.
I never thought it would be my boy. I never thought that.
Mama?
She was sick a long time.
She was sick when she wrote you,
but she didn't say it.
I never thought you'd come back.
She did.
Where's Rae?
She's gone. Gone to town.
She hated working the farm...
Just like you.
What happened?
They run me off.
They burned me out.
Made it so I couldn't do...
Just like Georgia.
You own this land.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.
Malachi,
I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in them hills.
Hiding out.
Afraid to walk my own land.
What about the law? Whose law?
Whose law? The law here runs a man down just like these cattle.
That ain't right.
I had enough of what ain't right.
What we got here is a bad situation.
These homesteaders you brought in with you are gonna make it worse.
When they come into this office to stake their claims,
it's going to be the start of big trouble.
They're gonna cut McKendrick off in the north.
You know, a man could die of thirst
before anybody offered him a drink around here.
Maybe you ought to come to California with Jake and me.
Yeah.
Augie's going to grow up here.
There's nothing wrong with the land.
It's just some of the people.
Problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie.
Emmett didn't kill anybody.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense, sure enough,
but I do think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo.
I think that's definitely the word.
The son is worse than the old man was.
He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming.
He'll do anything to keep his range free.
I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
Ah, I think Jake here can take care of himself.
I just did five years I didn't owe.
McKendrick ought to be satisfied with that and let it lie.
What brings you out of your hole, Johnson?
Who's that with you, Ezra?
This is my son. He's come home.
Ain't that sweet, Red?
I'm afraid you boys are trespassing on McKendrick land.
You got it all wrong, mister. This is our place.
RED: What?
RED: What? Mr. McKendrick bought this place from your father.
That's a lie.
Tomorrow, we're going to town and straighten that out once and for all.
The next day, we'll be back here, farming,
and them cattle better be gone.
If I find any cattle on our land after tomorrow,
I'm going to start carving them into steaks,
and believe me, that's one thing I know about.
Killing cattle is a hanging offense in these parts.
If we shot you down right now, we'd be within our rights.
Mister, you ever seen what a Henry rifle can do
in the hands of somebody who knows how to use it?
Who would that be? You?
(URGING HORSE) This ain't the end of it.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
(INHALING)
(PIANO PLAYING JAUNTY MUSIC) How are you?
Finally got the beer.
Are you gentlemen doing all right?
Oh, we're doing fine, we've had a long ride.
WOMAN: What can I do you for, stranger?
You work here?
I run the place.
What can I get you?
Bourbon.
Right.
Nifty.
The world is what you make of it, friend.
If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
I'll drink to that.
Join me, Miss...
Stella.
Paden.
Stella.
Are you the midnight star herself?
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella.
This is what I call a saloon...
Thanks. That's what I call it, too.
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
It's the only place I'm happy.
Me too.
What's wrong with us?
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, say, with the gambling?
See that fellow playing with his hair?
That's Kelly, my so-called partner.
He runs that side.
So-called?
So-called? Yeah. Apart from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat,
he's just the man I would have picked.
Why'd you go into business with him?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Who's the owner?
Here he comes right now.
(BOTH GASP) COBB: You look fine tonight, Phoebe. (PHOEBE LAUGHS)
Well, look at this.
Two of my favorite people in the world talking to each other.
Stella,
this is one of my oldest surviving friends.
Treat him right.
That was my plan.
Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along just fine.
You've got a lot in common.
Hey, Kelly.
Get over here.
You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?
(LAUGHS) Kelly, meet my friend, Paden.
Howdy.
Give the man a line of credit.
He already owes the house 13 bucks.
You got a place to stay?
I just got into town.
Stella, we've still got that extra room out back, don't we?
It's not in use at the moment.
COBB: What brings you to my saloon?
Luck, I guess.
Ah, good old Paden.
I was hoping maybe you'd changed your mind about the job.
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
Oh, that ain't the half of it, friend.
(CLEARING THROAT) Welcome to heaven.
(GUN COCKS) MAN: Where's the other one, Johnson?
Our orders are to run you two out of here.
You couldn't leave well enough alone, could you, old man?
If you tell us where your son is, there don't have to be any shooting.
You're lying, Hoyt, like always.
Not this time. I got my orders.
My son's on the way to town.
That's too bad.
You're just going to have to go by yourself.
Daddy?
Daddy.
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman,
but she's got a hard idea for living.
Yeah?
All I'm saying is you won't trip over me if you look her up.
I'm going to California with my brother.
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett.
He's a friend of mine. This is Sheriff Cobb.
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
The pleasure's mine.
The pleasure's mine. Always happy to meet a friend of Paden's.
Hey, Stella, bring Kelly out here, will you?
You're...
You're Kate Hollis' brother, aren't you?
That's right.
Ah. You're the one that killed old Murdo McKendrick.
I didn't have much choice. He was about to shoot my brother in the back.
Can't be having that, now, can we?
KELLY: You want to see me?
Kelly, we're going to make an adjustment.
I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job.
I think he could do it without getting greedy.
Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
What are you talking about?
I'm done talking, Kelly.
Get out.
You can't do this.
Really?
How about it, Paden? You want the job?
I see you're an understanding boss.
Well, nothing like that would ever happen between us.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
You'd be welcome.
No, Kelly! He'll kill you!
COBB: Stella.
Thanks for warning me.
(CLEARING THROAT) Didn't have much choice.
COBB: All right, stand back.
I never enjoy killing a man.
Excuse me.
Sheriff, I'm a gambler
who'd like to run an honest game here in your town.
To whom do I speak about that?
I hope it's not this gentleman.
That's him.
I better find somebody to clean up this mess.
You used to ride with that guy?
(GRUNTS) JAKE: What are you doing?
I told you to practice on horses not moving, huh?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Well, where you going?
Well, I got things to do, kid. I'm a busy man.
I'll go with ya.
A grown man can't have a little boy with him everywhere he goes, you know?
everywhere he goes, you know?
Well, who's a grown man?
MAL: Hello, Rae.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were done with our family.
Daddy's dead.
He was murdered.
Who did it?
I'm not sure, but I've got an idea,
and when I'm sure, they're gonna pay.
Oh, that's just fine.
Where were you when Mama and Daddy needed you?
It's too late, Mal.
Now you finally show up,
and all you can think is to get yourself killed.
You okay, Rae?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Will you introduce me to your friend?
He's not my friend. He used to be my brother.
Calvin Stanhope.
But my mother called me Slick.
Excuse me.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
That's none of your business.
Rae, all we got is each other.
I don't have any family anymore.
DANCE CALLER: Promenade.
Whoo!
I'm surprised to see you out here today.
I just come out to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Yeah.
Yeah. Jake and me will be heading out for California soon.
You came all the way out here
just to tell me you're going to California?
All you had to do was go and we'd never see each other again.
That's why I'm here.
Why?
You don't make it easy on a fella.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
Yeah.
That must have been it.
WOMAN: It's McKendrick's men!
(WOMEN SCREAMING)
Move!
All right, let's go!
God damn it!
We won't quit, you bastards!
PADEN: Is that a fair mix?
I'm saving lives here.
The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
I meant, it seemed like a lot of whiskey.
What's this?
That's the good stuff.
Oh, yeah?
How good?
Here's to the good stuff.
May it last a long time.
(DOOR OPENS) You'd better get out here.
Nothing happened, Tyree. This is my job.
Shut up.
I don't believe a lady has to explain anything to a man this ugly.
What's the trouble here?
Stay out of this, Paden.
He can't do that, Tyree. Cobb's hired him.
That's Cobb's mistake.
Come on out of there, Phoebe. You've done enough.
Go on home, Jake.
All I did was kiss the girl.
That's what you said in Turley.
Remember how that ended?
What's the matter, Paden?
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I don't want you getting anybody in my place.
I should have killed you a long time ago.
Why not now?
(STELLA GASPING) Don't do it, Tyree.
I just lost a partner.
I just lost a partner. If you kill him, I'll never get anyone to work in here.
You'd better start looking.
(PIANO PLAYING JAUNTY MUSIC)
You really are a gambler, aren't you?
Give me some of the good stuff.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
Whoa! Hold it!
Sorry about that.
Hey!
Where'd you get this horse, kid?
This is my uncle's horse.
Like hell it is.
What's the problem, Swann?
Yeah.
What's the problem?
Emmett.
McKendrick.
I didn't know you were out.
Seem short to you?
That's all over with, as far as I'm concerned, Emmett.
I'm satisfied.
Sounds good.
All right, then. Let's go.
Mr. McKendrick.
Don't you recognize this pinto?
What?
That's Lee's horse.
Shut up, Swann.
Wait a minute.
Get down from there, Augie.
EMMETT: The man who lost this horse must have been working for you.
I should have known.
But you changed your brand, Ethan.
A lot of things changed when my father died.
He must be pretty good.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
What about his brother?
We'll handle that.
He's careless.
Things are getting messy around here.
I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
I heard that, too.
Did you hear his son is still around?
Cobb, looks like you're finally gonna earn your money.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care about money.
(LAUGHING) He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does.
There's just no telling what it's gonna be.
Sheriff. Howdy, Mr. Slick.
Let me tell you about your friend Paden.
Me and him and Tyree, and a few others,
we did a good bit of riding together a few years back.
Business, you know, and business was pretty good.
We were moving around a lot,
the way you have to in that line of work.
And somewhere along the line, we picked up this dog,
and one of the boys took to feeding it,
so it followed us everywhere.
so it followed us everywhere. Anyway, this one time, we were leaving a little Missouri town
in quite a hurry, bunch of the locals hot on our tail,
and this dog somehow got tangled up with Tyree's horse.
Tyree went flying.
Tyree was pretty mad when he jumped up,
Tyree was pretty mad when he jumped up, and being Tyree, he shot the dog.
Didn't kill him, though.
And before you know it, Paden is off his horse,
and he's holding this dog.
He'd gone all strange on us.
Said we should go on without him.
Hell, I thought he was kidding at first, but he wasn't.
Tyree was ready to plug them both.
All this with a posse coming down on us.
I thought we were pals after all that riding we'd done together.
All of a sudden, he was more worried about some mutt.
Well, we did like he asked, and we left him,
and he went to jail for a dog.
You want to hear the funny part?
Paden didn't even like that damn dog.
It evened out in the end.
They locked me up, but the dog sprung me.
Where's the dog now?
He left me.
Come on, Paden. I'll buy you a drink.
I took out $13.
This is a lot of money.
I told you this was a sweet setup.
It is that.
Maybe you could run it without Stella.
This is her life.
I'll go before she does.
Easy, boy. It was just an idea.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
You know, Paden,
what makes all this work is me doing my job.
Those fellas you come to town with, they're causing some trouble.
It's going to take some straightening out.
I have my responsibilities.
I just want you to understand it has nothing to do with us.
What is it you want from me?
Nothing.
Do nothing.
Don't get between us.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
We understand each other.
Don't worry about me.
If you're taking on Emmett,
If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
You're empty, mister.
Ain't you dead yet, mister?
Cobb said he'd be hard to kill.
I guess you couldn't hear us coming.
He was practicing so hard for a fight,
he missed the whole thing.
So long, stranger.
Now, I don't want to kill you, and you don't want to be dead.
He can't be that good, Tyree.
You want to find out?
I think we should do like he says.
How you feeling?
I'd be a lot worse you hadn't come along.
Well, I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.
Jake said you were out there.
I saw him in town and he told me
I saw him in town and he told me about that business the other day.
Said you boys took a Henry rifle
off of one of McKendrick's men.
off of one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
That's it.
This was my father's.
The men who killed him took it.
I'm sorry.
I've got to get to my brother.
They'd come after me, they'll want him, too.
MAL: You'll never make it. I got to.
I'll go.
I'll bring Jake out here.
You be careful.
You're in it now.
It's going to get mean.
Augie, I've had enough of this.
Kiss your father and get in bed.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Rae, I need help.
So why come to me?
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.
The men who killed Daddy are after Jake.
I've got to talk to him.
And what's stopping you?
And what's stopping you? They're watching the Hollis' place. I can't get through.
What makes you think I could?
Why would they stop you?
'Cause I'm your sister.
He ain't in the saloon neither.
Where is that boy?
WOMAN: You're crazy.
(JAKE GRUNTING)
Why him?
You need help, don't you?
Jake said he'd meet you behind the church.
Be careful. They're all over the place.
Thanks.
Good luck.
Well, you must be Ezra Johnson's boy.
Now, don't shoot the Sheriff.
That's against the law.
So is killing a deputy.
(GROANS) Now, we're gonna give you a fair trial...
...followed by a first-class hanging.
Or you could ride out of here before dawn.
All you've got to do is tell me where I can find your friend Emmett.
Why are they doing this, Mal?
Because they enjoy it.
What happened to Emmett?
Cobb's men just about killed him.
That's what happened.
I got there just short of too late.
Lucky.
Yeah.
It's working out real good.
Where's Emmett now?
You're working for Cobb these days, aren't you?
Your friends have been beating me to find that out.
You think I'm just going to tell you?
You waltzed in here pretty easy.
You can go out the same way.
Me, they're figuring to carry out.
Is he all right?
Looks bad, Rae.
He's a hard man,
and he won't give them what they want.
It's gonna cost him.
Well, can't you stop 'em?
I don't think so.
PHOEBE: Rae.
What is it?
Oh, Kate.
Sweet Kate.
MAN: Don't.
Well, Jake's been with me all evening. I just left him.
Where is he now?
Went home.
Been with you all evening?
Even after Slick came to get him?
Slick didn't come.
(KATE SCREAMS)
KATE: No!
Stop it!
He saw us.
Bring him with us.
MAN: Fire!
The land office is on fire!
Help J.T.
Where's Augie? Her boy must be upstairs.
No. No.
They took him.
They took my Augie.
They took my Augie. (ALARM BELL RINGING)
(ALARM BELL RINGING)
Careful. Easy.
STELLA: Lafferty, you go around the back of the house.
Wyoming, you go over there and help out.
Tom, you go help with the buckets, too.
Nathan, help with that wagon.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
(GASPS)
Give it up.
I hate to see this kind of thing in my town.
I'm going to have to look into this.
Yeah, maybe I will, too.
I thought we talked about that.
We didn't talk about this.
They took the little boy, Cobb.
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)
You're still worried about the dog, aren't you?
You've got to calm down, Paden.
Everything will be put straight in a few days.
Yeah, I saw how you put Mal Johnson straight.
Never could count on you to be reasonable.
Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
Cobb, you got nothing I need.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden.
I'm worried about Stella.
What's she got to do with this?
Not a thing.
She's just a mutual friend.
But if you wind up on the wrong side of this,
she's going to get hurt.
I'm trying to save you from yourself.
Don't change your luck.
(STELLA SIGHING) STELLA: What is it that I can't figure?
What do you mean?
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
What makes you say that?
If he didn't, you would never sit still with all this going on.
You sure?
Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
No.
What's he got?
Cobb says there's no telling what you're gonna care about.
Is that what he said?
Well, he figured it okay this time.
Look who's here, Johnson.
Your sweet little sister.
Maybe I'd better search her.
Won't be easy, you know.
I only got one good hand.
Rae.
Garth.
You in there, Garth?
To my midnight star.
Cobb's using me to stop you,
so good people are being hurt because of me.
That makes me mad.
Some people think because they're stronger or meaner,
they can push you around.
I've seen a lot of that,
but it's only true if you let it be.
The world is what you make of it.
I like your attitude, but it can be risky.
I'm ready for that.
What about you?
(SIGHS) I don't want you to get hurt.
He can't hurt me
if he's dead.
Stella, come quick.
She sprung her brother all by herself, and this is what happened.
He brought her here.
Where'd he go?
I told him about Jake and the little boy.
He went off after Emmett.
Stop your crying.
Go get Doc Skinner and bring him to the shed.
(RAE GROANS) Pick her up.
I've got a place to hide her.
You'd better get in there with her until this thing is over.
Where's Jake?
McKendrick's men got him.
Is he alive?
It's worse than that, Emmett.
They took him at your sister's house.
Her husband was shot. I don't know if he's going to make it.
Kate?
She was hurt...
Pretty bad.
Emmett...
They took the little boy with them.
Put on one of these.
This ought to do.
Garth?
Fox!
(SIGHS) Get Kyle and Dusty over here, and keep your eyes open.
We're running out of deputies.
Stampede!
(MEN CLAMORING)
Whoa! Whoa, boy!
Oh, no!
(MEN SHOUTING)
Go.
I've got it, I've got it.
Augie, where's Jake?
He's dead.
What?
He was trying to get away
and he fell off his horse, off a cliff.
Jake fell off his horse?
It's all right.
Yeah.
Where's Emmett?
He's inside.
Where have you been?
Playing dead.
Let's get out of here.
Right.
Mal!
EMMETT: Jake! AUGIE: Uncle Jake!
Hi, guys!
Come on, Augie.
Come on, Augie, jump.
Come on!
You on?
(BOTH URGING HORSE) JAKE: He's on the roof, Paden.
It never should've got this far, Cobb.
This is as far as it's going.
Well, I'll do my part,
but you better watch your ass.
These guys will shoot it off.
I'm going to enjoy this.
This used to be a peaceful town.
What's going on, Sheriff?
Hide and watch.
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)
MAN: Get off the street.
Any sign of Stella?
Been looking.
Now, see if you can find Rae.
Yeah.
(LOADING GUNS) You wait till we get back.
Don't come in.
See you around.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
You're on.
Let's get 'em!
Hey, Paden.
Good luck.
(SHIVERING) I'm going for the doctor.
You're going to be all right.
Don't be afraid, babe.
I'll stay with you until your little friend comes back.
Come on out, boys!
Jake's in town! Let's start the ball!
Hey.
Mal.
I'm glad you're here. I've been watching her, but she needs a doctor.
Yeah.
Looking for this?
It's all right. I'm here now.
Mal... Mal...
EMMETT: Come on.
What a waste.
This could've been such a sweet deal for us.
Yeah.
Bad luck.
Goodbye, Cobb.
Goodbye, Paden.
To California.
ALL: To California.
Got to go.
Right.
You take care of yourself, you hear?
You too.
Jake. Paden.
Come on, Molly.
RAE: Bye-bye. Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Weren't you gonna come out and say goodbye?
I already did that.
You know where I'll be.
Yeah.
So long, Paden.
So long, Jake.
Well, you might make a farmer yet.
I got a job.
Let's get going.
You take care of your folks.
It happened in the summer of 1959, a long time ago.
But only if you measure in terms of years.
I was living in a small town in Oregon called Castle Rock.
There were only 1281 people, but to me, it was the whole world.
It's the Bossman Bob Cormier. It's a beautiful Friday morning in Portland.
It's 90 degrees and getting hotter.
Up the ladder with another platter, Bobby Day with "Rockin' Robin."
It's boss.
Hey, how do you know a Frenchman's been in your backyard?
Hey, I'm French, okay.
Your garbage cans are empty and your dog's pregnant.
Didn't I just say I was French?
-I knock. -Shit.
-Twenty-nine. -Twenty-two.
Piss up a rope.
Gordie's out. Old Gordie just bit the bag and stepped out the door.
Come on, man, deal.
Teddy Duchamp was the craziest guy we hung around with.
He didn't have much of a chance in life. His dad was given to fits of rage.
One time he held Teddy's ear to a stove and almost burned it off.
I knock.
You four-eyed pile of shit.
Pile of shit has a thousand eyes.
What? What's so funny? Come on. I've got 30, what have you got?
-Sixteen. -Go ahead, keep laughing.
You're down to your ride, pal.
Chris Chambers was the leader of our gang, and my best friend.
He came from a bad family, and everyone just knew he'd turn out bad.
Including Chris.
That's not the secret knock.
I forget the secret knock. Let me in.
Vern.
Come on, you guys, open up.
Oh, man, you guys are not gonna believe this. This is so boss.
Oh, man, wait till you hear this. You won't believe it. It's unbelievable.
Let me catch my breath. I ran all the way from my house.
Come on, you guys, listen to me. This is boss. Come on.
Okay, forget it. I don't have to tell you nothing.
Hold on, you guys. What is it, man?
Okay, great, you won't believe this, sincerely.
Screw you guys. Forget it.
What is it?
Can you guys camp tonight if you tell your folks? In my back field?
Yeah, I think so.
My dad's kind of on a mean streak. He's been drinking a lot lately.
You got to. Sincerely, you won't believe this. Can you, Gordie?
Yeah, probably.
What are you pissing and moaning about, Verno?
-I knock. -What?
You liar. You ain't got no pat hand. You didn't deal yourself no pat hand.
Make your draw, shit heap.
You guys wanna go see a dead body?
Well, I was under the porch digging, you know?
We all understood what Vern meant right away.
At the beginning of the school year, he buried a jar of pennies...
...underneath his house.
He drew a treasure map so he could find them again.
A week later, his mom cleaned out his room and threw away the map.
Vern had been trying to find those pennies for nine months.
Nine months, man.
You didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
Jesus Christ, Billy. We gotta do something.
Why? Who cares?
-We saw him. -So? It ain't nothing to us.
The kid's dead, so it ain't nothing to him.
Who gives a shit if they ever find him? I don't.
It's that kid they were talking about on the radio.
Brocker, or Brower, or Flowers, whatever his name is.
The train must have hit him.
Big fucking deal.
We had all followed the Ray Brower story very closely...
...because he was a kid our age.
Three days before, he'd gone out, and nobody had seen him since.
I think we should tell the cops.
You don't squawk to the cops after you boosted a car.
They're gonna wanna know how we got on Back Harlow Road.
They know we don't got no car.
We keep our mouth shut and they can't touch us.
Look, we could make an anonymous call.
They trace those calls, stupid.
I seen it on Highway Patrol and on Dragnet.
Yeah, right.
I just wish we never boosted that goddamned Dodge.
I wish Ace had been with us.
-Could've told the cops we was in his car. -He wasn't.
-We gonna tell him? -We're not gonna tell nobody.
Nobody, never. You dig me?
I know the Back Harlow Road.
It comes to a dead end by the Royal River. The train tracks are right there.
Me and my dad used to fish out there.
If they knew you were there, they'd have killed you.
Could he have gotten from Chamberlain to Harlow? That's really far.
Sure. He must have started walking on the train tracks...
...and just followed them the whole way. Yeah, right.
And then after dark, a train must have come along and el smacko.
Yeah.
Hey. Hey, you guys.
I bet if we find him, we get our pictures in the paper.
-Yeah, we could even be on TV. -Sure.
-We'll be heroes. -Yeah.
I don't know. Billy will know I found out.
He's not gonna care. It's gonna be us that find him...
...not Billy and Charlie Hogan.
They'll probably pin a medal on you, Vern.
-Yeah, you think so? -Sure.
-What'll we tell our folks? -Exactly what you said.
We'll tell our folks we're tenting out in your field.
You tell your folks you're sleeping over at Teddy's.
Then we're going to the drag races the next day.
-We're rock solid till dinner tomorrow. -Man, that's a plan and a half.
But if we do find that kid's body...
...they'll know we didn't go to the drag races.
Nobody will care.
Everybody's gonna be so jazzed about what we found.
-It's not gonna make a difference. -Yeah.
My dad will hide me anyway, but it's worth a hiding.
-What do you say? -All right.
-Gordie? -Sure.
-Vern? -I don't know.
-Vern. -Come on, Verno.
Vern.
-Vern. Come on, Verno. -Come on, Verno.
-Okay. -All right.
Too cool. Too cool. Very cool. Very, very cool. Yes.
I wanted to share my friends' enthusiasm, but I couldn't.
That summer at home, I had become the Invisible Boy.
Mom, do you know where my canteen is?
Mom?
It's in Denny's room.
In April, my older brother, Dennis, had been killed in a jeep accident.
Four months had passed...
...but my parents still hadn't been able to put the pieces back together again.
Gordie, I got something for you.
This, my friend, is for you.
-But, Denny, this is your Yankee cap. -No, this is your Yankee cap.
It's good luck. You know how many fish we're gonna catch?
-How much? -A bazillion.
A bazillion fish. And it looks good on you too. Just like that.
Hey, Moe, I'm going blind.
Don't start with me, porcupine. Come here, give me a hug.
You found it.
You found it.
Yeah.
Why can't you have friends like Denny's?
Dad, they're okay.
Sure they are. A thief and two feebs.
Chris isn't a thief.
He stole the milk money at school.
He's a thief in my book.
It was almost noon as we set out to find a dead kid named Ray Brower.
Right here's cool.
Hey, Chris.
-Thanks a lot. -Sure thing.
-Gordo. -Hey, man.
-You wanna see something? -Sure. What?
-Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine.
-Come on, man. -What is it?
-Man, you've gotta see this. -Come on, man. What is it?
Come on, what is it?
You wanna be the Lone Ranger or the Cisco Kid?
Walking, talking Jesus.
-Where'd you get this? -Hocked it from my old man's bureau.
-It's a .45. -I can see that.
-You got shells for it? -Yeah.
I took all that was left in the box.
My dad'll think that he used them himself shooting at beer cans while he was drunk.
-Is it loaded? -Hell, no. What do you think I am?
-Jesus! -Jesus! Let's get out of here! Come on!
Gordie did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting up Castle Rock!
-Shut up! -Hey, who did that?
Who's letting cherry bombs off out here?
Man, you should have seen your face. Damn, that was cool.
-That was really fine. -You knew it was loaded, you wet end!
I'm gonna be in trouble. That babe saw me.
-She thought it was firecrackers. -That was a mean trick.
Hey, Gordie...
...I didn't know it was loaded.
-Honest. -You swear?
Yeah, I swear.
-On your mother's name? -Yeah.
Even if she goes to hell because you lied?
Yeah, I swear.
Pinkie swear?
Pinkie swear.
Hey, girls, where you going?
Hey, come on. My brother gave me that.
-And now you're giving it to me. -Give it to me! Come on, that's mine!
You're a real asshole, you know that?
Your brother's not very polite, Eyeball. Now, Christopher,
I know you didn't mean to insult my friend.
I know he didn't mean to insult me.
That's why I'm gonna give him the opportunity of taking it back.
-Shit. -Take it back, kid.
-Come on, stop, you're hurting him. -You bastard. Let go.
-Stop it, man. Cut it out. -Take it back, kid.
-Cut it out! -Take it back.
You big-- Okay, okay, I take it back. I take it back.
There. Now I feel a whole lot better about this.
How about you?
Good.
See you later, girls.
Come on, just forget them.
What do we need a pistol for, anyway?
It's spooky sleeping out at night in the woods. You might see a bear.
Or a garbage can.
I brought a comb.
What do we need a comb for?
Well, if we get on TV we want to look good, don't we?
-That's a lot of thinking, Vern. -Thanks.
Two for flinching.
How far do you think it's gonna be?
If we follow the tracks all the way into Harlow, it'll be about 20 miles.
-Sound about right to you, Gordie? -Yeah, it might even be 30.
Maybe we should just hitchhike.
-No way, that sucks. -Why not?
We could go out to Route 7 to the Shiloh Church...
...then down the Back Harlow Road. We'll be there by sundown.
...then down the Back Harlow Road. We'll be there by sundown. -That's pussy. -Hey, it's a long ways.
-That's pussy. -Hey, it's a long ways.
Did your mother ever have any kids that lived?
What do you mean?
We have to fill up at the junkyard. My dad said it's a safe well.
-Not if Chopper's there. -If Chopper's there we'll send you in. Very funny.
Hey, I'm kind of hungry. Who's got the food?
Oh, shit. Did anybody bring anything?
Not me. Gordie?
This is great. What are we supposed to do, eat our feet?
You mean you didn't bring anything either?
This wasn't my idea, it was Vern's. Why didn't you bring something?
What am I supposed to do? I brought the comb.
What do you need a comb for? You don't have any hair.
-I brought it for you guys. -Hey, hey, hey!
Let's see how much money we got.
Yeah, I got $1.02.
And 68 cents from Chris.
Sixty cents from Teddy.
Seven cents, Vern?
I haven't found my pennies yet.
Well, 2.37 is not bad.
Quidacioluo's is at the end of that little road.
-I think we can get some stuff there. -Train coming.
Geronimo!
-Come on, Teddy. -No.
I'm gonna dodge it.
Come on, Teddy, man. Get off the tracks. You're crazy.
Train dodge. Dig it?
Get the hell off the tracks, Teddy. You wanna get yourself killed?
Just like the beach at Normandy.
-Come on, man. Come on. -No, no!
-Let me dodge the train. -Come on!
You asshole! You son of a bitch!
Don't tell me what to do, I'll kill you! You son of a bitch!
I was trying to save your life. You wanna kill yourself?
Is that what you want, goddamn it? You tried to kill yourself.
I don't need no babysitter.
You do too.
Skin it.
I could have dodged it.
Listen, Teddy, you can dodge it on the way back, man.
Peace.
Skin it.
About this time, Charlie and Billy were playing mailbox baseball...
...with Ace and Eyeball.
Shit, I'm out. Goddamn it.
Shit, I'm out. Goddamn it. Shouldn't have gone for a wooden one.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know, asshole?
Billy, you're up.
You guys win. I don't wanna play no more.
You can't quit.
We only played three innings. That'd be a non-official game.
Hey, Ace, me and--
What's with you homos? You've been acting psycho all day.
-What is it? -It's nothing. Nothing. It's nothing, right?
Then I'd like to finish this game...
...before I start collecting my goddamned Social Security, okay?
You're up, Billy. Move it. All right, give me this fucking stick.
Let's play ball.
Foul ball.
Hey, Vern, looks like your ma's been out driving again.
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.
Stand back, men.
Paratroopers, over the side!
"No Trespassing" was enforced by Milo Pressman, the junkman...
...and his dog, Chopper... ...the most-feared and least-seen dog in Castle Rock.
Legend had it that Milo had trained Chopper not just to sic...
...but to sic specific parts of the human anatomy.
Thus, a kid who had illegally scaled the junkyard fence...
...might hear the dread cry, "Chopper, sic balls!"
But right now neither the dread Chopper, nor Milo, was anywhere in sight.
Teddy's crazy. Where's the B.A.R.? Come on, men, move it out!
Where's the B.A.R.? Come on, men, move it out! Yeah. He won't live to be 20, I bet.
Yeah. He won't live to be 20, I bet.
Remember the time you saved him in the tree?
Yeah. You know, I dream about that sometimes.
Except in the dream I always miss him. I get a couple hairs and down he goes.
-It's weird. -Yeah, that is weird.
But you didn't miss him. Chris Chambers never misses, does he?
Not even when the ladies leave the seat down.
Hey, I'll race you. -No, I don't think so. -Right to the pump. Come on.
-No, I don't think so. -Right to the pump. Come on. -I'm kind of tired. Go! -You're a dead man, Lachance.
-I'm kind of tired. Go! -You're a dead man, Lachance.
It looks like Lachance has got him. He's got Chambers beat.
But what's this? Chambers is making his move.
Lachance is fading, it's Chambers at the tape.
The crowd goes wild.
You guys watching The Mickey Mouse Club lately?
-Yeah. -I think Annette's tits are getting bigger.
-You think so? -Yeah, I think so.
I think he's right. I've been noticing the A and the E...
I think he's right. I've been noticing the A and the E... ...are starting to bend around the sides.
-Annette's tits are great. -Yeah.
This is really a good time.
-The most. -A blast.
Vern didn't just mean being off-limits inside the junkyard...
...or fudging on our folks... ...or going on a hike up the railroad to Harlow.
He meant those things, but it seems to me now... ...it was more, and that we all knew it.
Everything was there and around us.
We knew exactly who we were and exactly where we were going.
It was grand.
Great, spit at the fat kid. Real good.
What time is it, Gordie?
It's a quarter after 1.
We'd better go get the food. Junkyard opens at 3. -Chopper'll be here. -Sic balls.
-Chopper'll be here. -Sic balls.
You go. You could pick us up on the way back.
-I'm not going alone. We should all go. -I'm staying right here.
-Yeah, man, I'm not going. -Girls, cool it. We'll flip for it.
Okay.
-Odd man goes. -That's you, Gordie, odd as a cod.
Flip or eat lead.
Four tails.
Oh, Jesus, man, that's a goocher.
-Come on, Vern. -That doesn't mean anything.
-Let's go again. -No, a goocher. That's really bad.
You remember when Clint Bracken and those guys got wiped out in Durham?
Billy told me they were flipping for beers.
They came up with a goocher before they got into the car, and, bang.
They all got totaled.
I don't like this. Sincerely.
Verno, nobody believes that crap about moons and goochers. It's baby stuff. Now, come on, flip again.
It's baby stuff. Now, come on, flip again.
-You gonna flip or not? -Come on, Vern, we don't have all day.
You lose, Gordie.
Gordie loses. Old Gordie just screwed the pooch.
Does the word "retarded" mean anything to you?
Gordie, go get the provisions, you morphadite.
Don't call me any of your mother's pet names.
-What a wet end you are, Lachance. -Shut up.
I don't shut up, I grow up. And when I look at you, I throw up.
And then your mother goes around the corner and she licks it up.
Finding new and preferably disgusting ways to degrade a friend's mother...
Finding new and preferably disgusting ways to degrade a friend's mother... ...was always held in high regard.
Ain't you Denny Lachance's brother?
Yes, sir.
Shame what happened to him.
The Bible says, "In the midst of life we are in death." Did you know that?
I lost a brother in Korea.
You look like your brother, Denny. People ever tell you that?
Sometimes.
I remember the year he was All-Conference. Quarterback, he played.
Boy, could he throw. Father God and Sonny Jesus.
Could be some scouts at the game tomorrow.
-I don't know, Pop. -Dad, can I have the potatoes?
-I don't know, Pop. -Dad, can I have the potatoes? -That's what I hear, son. -Are you gonna see Jane after the game?
-That's what I hear, son. -Are you gonna see Jane after the game?
I think she's a lovely girl. -Can I please have the potatoes? -Dorothy, don't talk to the boy about girls.
-Can I please have the potatoes? -Dorothy, don't talk to the boy about girls.
-Can I please have the potatoes? -Dorothy, don't talk to the boy about girls. He shouldn't be thinking about girls. This is the biggest game of his life.
He shouldn't be thinking about girls. This is the biggest game of his life.
Dennis, when you're out there tomorrow--
Did you read the story Gordie wrote? Gordie wrote a story.
-It was really good. -What did you write, sweetheart?
Now, see, that's what I'm talking about. Football takes concentration.
Start on the girls and his mind's all over the place.
Gordie, I really liked it.
-I thought it was great. -I don't want you interrupting me.
You see I'm talking to the boy, don't you?
You play football?
Do you play football?
No.
What do you do?
I don't know.
Yeah, well, your brother, Denny, sure could play football.
Here you go, kid, buck and a half of hamburger.
Hey! Hey, you, kid! What are you doing there? Come over here!
You, come back here, goddamn it! I'll sic my dog on you!
Run, Gordie, run! Run, Gordie!
Chopper, sic him! Sic him, boy!
Now, he said, "Sic him, boy."
But what I heard was, "Chopper, sic balls."
That's Chopper?
Chopper was my first lesson in the vast difference between myth and reality.
Come on, Choppie. Kiss my ass, Choppie. Kiss my ass.
Come on, bite shit.
Go on, Choppie. Sic balls, Choppie.
You kids, stop teasing that dog, you hear me? Stop teasing him.
I'm gonna beat your ass, teasing my dog like that.
I'd like to see you climb this fence, fat ass.
Don't you call me that. You little tin-weasel peckerwood loony's son.
What did you call me?
I know who you are. You're Teddy Duchamp.
Your dad's a loony.
A loony up in the nuthouse at Togus.
He took your ear and put it to a stove and burnt it off.
My father stormed the beach at Normandy.
He's crazier than a shithouse rat.
No wonder you're acting the way you are with a loony for a father.
You call my dad a loony again and I'll kill you.
Loony, loony, loony.
I'm gonna rip your head off and shit down your neck!
No, I'm gonna kill him!
You come on and try it, you slimy bastard.
He wants to go over there so he can beat the piss out of you.
You watch your mouth. Let him do his own fighting.
Sure, you only outweigh him by 500 pounds, fat ass.
I know your name.
You're Lachance. I know all you guys.
And all your fathers are gonna get a call from me.
Except for the loony up in Togus.
-Come on, man. -I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!
-You little foul-mouthed whore master. -You son of a bitch!
-You little foul-mouthed whore master. -You son of a bitch! Come back here. Come back here, you hear me?
-Nobody ranks out my old man. -Come back here.
-My father stormed Normandy. -I said come back here.
-He stormed the beach, you faggot! -Come back here!
We showed him. Thought we were a bunch of pussies.
He ranked my old man.
I wondered how Teddy could care so much for his dad... ...who'd practically killed him. I couldn't give a shit about my dad...
...who'd practically killed him. I couldn't give a shit about my dad...
...who hadn't laid a hand on me since I was 3...
...for eating bleach under the sink.
He ranked my old man.
What do you care what a fat old pile of shit like him says about your dad?
He still stormed the beach at Normandy, right?
Yeah, forget it.
You think that pile of shit was at Normandy?
-Forget it. -He don't know nothing. He's dog shit.
Whatever's between you and your old man, he can't change that.
Forget it, all right? Just forget it.
I'm sorry if I'm spoiling everybody's good time.
It's okay, man. It's okay.
'm not sure it should be a good time.
-You saying you wanna go back? -No.
But going to see a dead kid, maybe it shouldn't be a party.
Yeah. Like if he's really bad, like all cut up and blood and shit all over him.
-I might have nightmares. -Come on, Vern.
Like all guts and eyeballs all ready to jump and--
-Shut up, Vern, goddamn it. -Come on, Vern.
I can't help it.
Sorry.
It was only a quarter to 3, but it felt much later.
It was too hot and too much had happened.
We weren't even close to the Royal River yet.
We were gonna have to get moving and makes some miles before dark.
Hold still, will you?
Hold it.
So, what's with you and this Connie Palermo chick?
I've been seeing her for over a month and all she'll let me do is feel her tits.
She's a Catholic, man. They're all like that.
You wanna get laid, you gotta get yourself a Protestant.
A Jew's good.
A KLAM newsbreak. We interrupt to bring you an update on the search for...
A KLAM newsbreak. We interrupt to bring you an update on the search for... ...the missing Ray Brower.
The police have expanded efforts to include Motton...
-...Durham and the outlying areas. -Shit, when are they gonna give up?
-They're never gonna find him. -Not where they're looking.
Eyeball's right, they ain't never gonna find him.
Would you hold still? You're making me fuck up the snake part.
I'll tell you how they're gonna find him.
Ten years from now, some hunter's gonna go in the woods to take a leak...
...wind up pissing on his bones.
Bet you a thousand they find him before that.
Bet you $2000 they don't.
-Well, asshole-- -Hey, what's the big deal?
-Who cares? -Would you two just shut the fuck up?
If either one of you assholes had $2000, I'd kill you both.
We're back here with Bob Cormier.
From the racks and stacks, it's the best on wax.
It's the Chordettes, with "Lollipop."
Hey, I got some Winstons. Hocked them off my old man's dresser.
One apiece for after supper.
-Yeah, that's cool. -Yeah.
That's when a cigarette tastes best, after supper.
Right.
Do you think I'm weird? -Definitely. -No, man, seriously.
-Definitely. -No, man, seriously. Am I weird?
Yeah, but so what? Everybody's weird.
-You ready for school? -No.
Junior high. You know what that means.
By next June we'll all be split up.
What are you talking about? Why would that happen?
It's not gonna be like grammar school, that's why. You'll be taking college courses. Me, Teddy and Vern...
You'll be taking college courses. Me, Teddy and Vern... ...will be in the shop courses with the rest of the retards making birdhouses.
...will be in the shop courses with the rest of the retards making birdhouses.
You're gonna meet a lot of new guys. Smart guys.
-Meet a lot of pussies is what you mean. -No, man.
Don't say that. Don't even think that.
-I'm not going in with pussies, forget it. -Then you're an asshole.
What's asshole about wanting to be with friends?
It's asshole if your friends drag you down.
You hang with us, you'll just be another wise guy with shit for brains.
You think Mighty Mouse could beat Superman?
-What are you, cracked? -Why not?
The other day, he was carrying five elephants in one hand.
Boy, you don't know nothing.
Mighty Mouse is a cartoon. Superman is a real guy. No way a cartoon could beat up a real guy.
Superman is a real guy. No way a cartoon could beat up a real guy.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Would be a good fight though.
I mean, you could be a real writer someday, Gordie.
Fuck writing. I don't want to be a writer.
-It's stupid. It's a stupid waste of time. -That's your dad talking.
-Bullshit. -Bull true.
I know how your dad feels. He doesn't give a shit.
Denny was the one he cared about, and don't try to tell me different.
-You're just a kid, Gordie. -Oh, gee, thanks, Dad.
I wish the hell I was your dad.
You wouldn't be going around talking about taking stupid shop courses if I was.
It's like God gave you something, man, all those stories that you can make up.
He said, "This is what we got for you, kid. Try not to lose it."
Kids lose everything unless there's someone to look out for them.
And if your parents are too fucked up to do it, then maybe I should.
Come on, you guys, let's get moving.
Yeah, by the time we get there the kid won't even be dead anymore.
Any of you guys know when the next train is due?
We could go down to the Route 136 bridge.
What are you, crazy? That's five miles down the river.
You walk five miles down the river, you gotta walk five back.
That could take till dark.
We cross here, we can get to the same place in 10 minutes.
Yeah, but if a train comes, there's nowheres to go.
No, there isn't. You just jump.
-Teddy, it's a hundred feet. -Yeah, Teddy.
Look, you guys can go around if you want to. I'm crossing here.
And while you guys are dragging your candy asses halfway across the state...
...I'll be waiting for you on the other side relaxing with my thoughts.
You use your left hand or your right hand for that?
You wish.
I lost the comb.
Forget it, Vern.
Train!
Oh, shit.
Move it, man! Go on! Move it!
Get up, Vern! Damn it!
Get up! Move it!
-Shit, Vern! Get up! -I don't want to. We're gonna fall.
We're gonna die, damn it! Get up!
Go!
-Vern, you gotta go faster! -I can't, Gordie!
Run!
Run!
Run! Run, man! Move your ass, man!
Move it!
Faster! Run! Go!
-Run, goddamn it, run! -Run, run, run!
Faster!
Hey, at least now we know when the next train was due.
Man, that was the all-time train dodge. Too cool.
Vern, you were so scared, you looked like that fat guy in Abbott and Costello...
-...when he saw the mummy. -I wasn't that scared.
-Come on. -Vern.
No, really, I wasn't. Sincerely.
Then you won't mind if we check your Jockeys for Hershey squirts?
Go screw.
-You better turn yours over. -This is the way I like to do it.
-Fine. -Oh, man. Oh, no, man.
-You got any more, Gordie? -Sorry, Vern.
Not funny. What am I supposed to eat?
-Why don't you cook your dick? -It'd be a small meal.
Screw you guys, I got it.
Nothing like a smoke after a meal.
Yeah, I cherish these moments.
What? What did I say?
Hey, Gordo, why don't you tell us a story?
I don't know.
-Oh, come on. -Yeah, come on, Gordo.
But not one of your horror stories, okay?
I don't wanna hear no horror stories. I'm not up for that.
Why don't you tell us one about Sergeant Steele and his battling leathernecks?
The one I've been thinking about is different.
It's about this pie-eating contest.
The main guy of the story is this fat kid that nobody likes named Davie Hogan.
Like Charlie Hogan's brother, if he had one.
Good, Vern.
Go on, Gordie.
Well, this kid, he's our age, but he's fat. Real fat.
He weighs close to 180, but, you know, it's not his fault. It's his glands.
Oh, yeah, my cousin's like that. Sincerely.
She weighs over 300 pounds. Supposed to be a "hyboid" gland or something.
I don't know about any "hyboid" gland, but what a blimp.
No shit. She looks like a Thanksgiving turkey.
-And, you know, this one time-- -Will you shut up, Vern?
Yeah, right. Go on, Gordie. It's a swell story.
All the kids, instead of calling him Davie, they call him Lardass. Lardass Hogan.
Even his little brother and sister call him Lardass.
At school, they put this sticker on his back that says "Wide Load."
And they rank him out and beat him up whenever they get a chance.
But one day, he gets an idea.
The greatest revenge idea a kid ever had.
-Is this thing on? Can you hear me? -Yeah.
Now, the next contestant in the Great Tri-County Pie Eat...
...Principal John Wiggins.
And our celebrity contestant, from KLAM in Portland...
...The Bossman himself, Bob Cormier.
Thanks, man. Hey, from the racks and stacks, it's the best on wax.
How about another double golden-oldie sound sandwich from KLAM in Portland?
-It's.... -Boss!
Next, a newcomer to the Pie Eat...
...but one we expect great things from in the future.
Young master David Hogan.
-Are you all right, young man? -Hey, Lardass, how was your trip?
I hear you got a big appetite, Lardass.
Don't even think about winning this.
Boy, are you fat.
Don't pay attention to those fools, Lardass. I mean, Davie.
And now, the one you've all been waiting for.
The four-time champion, our own Bill Travis.
Listen, I got 10 riding on you myself, Billy Boy.
All right. Are you ready?
Hands behind your backs, gentlemen.
Drum roll.
-Hey, Lardass. Chow down, Wide Load. -Hey, Lardass. Chow down, Wide Load.
Go.
Done.
Done.
Done.
Done.
You better pace yourself if you want to hold out, boy.
Come on, Lardass!
Lardass! Lardass! Lardass!
Lardass! Lardass! Lardass!
Lardass! Lardass! Lardass!
Lardass! Lardass! Lardass!
What the audience didn't know...
...was that Lardass wasn't really interested in winning.
What he wanted was revenge.
And right before he was introduced, he'd gotten ready for it.
Principal John Wiggins.
And our celebrity contestant from KLAM in Portland...
...The Bossman himself, Bob Cormier!
Thanks, man. Hey, from the racks and stacks, it's the best on wax.
How about another double golden-oldie sound sandwich from KLAM in Portland?
It's....
Done.
Lardass! Lardass! Lardass!
Diving into his fifth pie, Lardass began to imagine that he wasn't eating pies.
He pretended he was eating cow flops and rat guts in blueberry sauce.
Done.
Lardass! Lardass! Lardass!
Slowly, a sound started to build in Lardass' stomach.
A strange and scary sound...
...like a log truck coming at you at a hundred miles an hour.
Suddenly, Lardass opened his mouth...
...and before Bill Travis knew it...
...he was covered with five pies worth of used blueberries.
The women in the audience screamed.
Bossman Bob Cormier took one look at Bill Travis...
...and barfed on Principal Wiggins.
Principal Wiggins barfed on the lumberjack that was sitting next to him.
Mayor Grundy barfed on his wife's tits.
But when the smell hit the crowd...
...that's when Lardass' plan really started to work.
Girlfriends barfed on boyfriends.
Kids barfed on their parents. A fat lady barfed in her purse.
The Donelley twins barfed on each other.
And the Women's Auxiliary barfed all over the Benevolent Order of Antelopes.
And Lardass just sat back and enjoyed what he'd created.
A complete and total barf-o-rama.
-Too cool. Too cool. -Man, that was the best, just the best.
-Yeah. -Then what happened?
-What do you mean? -I mean, what happened?
What do you mean, "What happened?" That's the end.
How can that be the end? What kind of an ending is that?
-What happened to Lardass? -I don't know.
Maybe he went home and celebrated with a couple of cheeseburgers.
Jeez, that ending sucks.
Why don't you make it so that Lardass goes home...
...and he shoots his father?
Then he runs away and he joins the Texas Rangers. How about that?
I don't know.
Something good like that.
I like the ending. The barfing was really good.
But there's one thing I didn't understand.
Did Lardass have to pay to get into the contest?
No, Vern, they just let him in.
Oh, great. Great story.
Great story, Gordie. I just didn't like the ending.
Where's the radio? Let's get some sounds.
Here.
We talked into the night.
The kind of talk that seemed important until you discover girls.
All right. All right. Mickey's a mouse, Donald's a duck, Pluto's a dog.
What's Goofy?
If I could only have one food for the rest of my life?
That's easy. Pez.
Cherry-flavored Pez. No question about it.
Goofy's a dog. He's definitely a dog.
I knew The $64,000 Question was fixed.
There's no way anybody could know that much about opera.
He can't be a dog. He wears a hat and drives a car.
Wagon Train is a really cool show...
...but did you ever notice that they never get anywhere?
They just keep wagon training.
God, that's weird.
What the hell is Goofy?
Not one of us mentioned Ray Brower, but we were all thinking about him.
-Oh, my God. -It's that Brower kid.
His ghost is out walking in the woods.
I promise I won't hock more dirty books. I won't say no more swears.
I promise I'll eat all my lima beans.
Two for flinching.
What is it, Chris?
Maybe it's coyotes.
Sounds like a woman screaming.
It's not coyotes. It's his ghost.
Don't say that.
Hey, Teddy, sit down.
I'm gonna go look for it. I wanna see the ghost.
Don't say that.
I just wanna see it. I just wanna see what he looks like.
Jesus H. bald-headed Christ!
Maybe we should stand guard.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Give me the gun. I'll take the first watch.
2300 hours. Corporal Teddy Duchamp stands guard.
No sign of the enemy. The fort is secure.
Shut up, Teddy, and keep your eyes peeled.
-Teddy, cut it out, okay? -I'm trying to sleep.
The dogfaces rested easy...
...in the knowledge that Corporal Teddy Duchamp...
...was protecting all that was dear to them.
Teddy.
It should have been you, Gordon.
Are you okay?
You were dreaming.
I didn't cry at Denny's funeral.
I miss him, Chris.
I really miss him.
I know.
Go back to sleep.
Maybe you could go into the college courses with me.
That'll be the day.
-Why not? You're smart enough. -They won't let me.
What do you mean?
It's the way people think of my family. It's the way they think of me.
I'm just one of those low-life Chambers kids.
That's not true.
Oh, it is.
No one even asked me if I took the milk money that time.
I just got a three-day vacation.
Did you take it?
Yeah, I took it. You knew I took it.
Teddy knew I took it.
Everyone knew I took it. Even Vern knew it, I think.
Maybe I was sorry and I tried to give it back.
You tried to give it back?
Maybe, just maybe.
And maybe I took it to old lady Simons and told her, and the money was all there.
But I still got a three-day vacation because it never showed up.
And maybe the next week, old lady Simons...
And maybe the next week, old lady Simons... ...had this brand-new skirt on when she came to school.
-Yeah, it was brown and it had dots on it. -Yeah.
Let's just say that I stole the milk money, but old lady Simons stole it back from me.
Just suppose that I told this story.
Me, Chris Chambers, kid brother to Eyeball Chambers.
-Do you think anyone would believe it? -No.
Do you think that bitch would have tried something like that...
...if it'd been one of those douche bags from the View?
-No way. -Hell, no.
But with me....
I'm sure she had her eye on that skirt for a long time.
Anyway, she saw her chance and she took it.
I was the stupid one for even trying to give it back.
I just never thought....
I never thought that a teacher....
Oh, who gives a fuck anyway?
I just wish that I could go someplace where nobody knows me.
I guess I'm just a pussy, huh?
No way, man.
The freight woke up the other guys.
It was on the tip of my tongue to tell them about the deer, but I didn't.
That was the one thing I kept to myself.
I've never spoken or written of it until just now.
Jeez, Gordie, how come you didn't get some breakfast stuff...
Jeez, Gordie, how come you didn't get some breakfast stuff... ...like Twinkies, and Pez, and root beer?
Sorry, Vern. I guess a more experienced shopper could've gotten more...
...for your seven cents.
With our stomachs rumbling, we pressed on toward the Royal River.
The reality of Ray Brower was growing, and kept us moving despite the heat.
For me, the idea of seeing that kid's dead body...
...was starting to become an obsession.
Gentlemen, the Royal.
God, the tracks go way out of the way.
If we cut across this field right here, we'll be there in an hour.
I think we should stick to the tracks.
I say we go across the field.
Gordie?
-Yeah. -Let's go.
Take no prisoners.
Hey, you guys, it's a lot safer if we....
-Come on, men. Let's take on.... -You don't know what's in those woods.
-Let's go. We're gonna get.... -Hey, you guys, wait up for me.
Ace, I gotta tell you something, but you gotta swear you won't tell anybody.
You got it, pal.
Hey, Eyeball, you know that Brower kid?
-What about him? -I could tell you something...
...but you gotta swear you ain't gonna tell nobody.
Billy and Charlie had managed to keep their enormous secret for about 36 hours.
A personal record for both of them.
By noon, Ace and Eyeball had told their secret to everybody in the gang.
I guess for those guys, protecting their mother's good name wasn't a top priority.
Hey, listen, Ace. Maybe me and Charlie shouldn't go.
Yeah, maybe you can go without us.
You guys are acting like my grandmother having a conniption fit.
I don't see your problem. We go up with fishing gear...
...and if a cop asks what we're doing, "We're here to take a couple of steelhead.
And look what we found."
Yeah, come on, man, we're gonna be famous.
We're gonna be on every radio and TV show in the country.
I still don't think we should go.
Okay. Okay.
You've stated your position clearly.
Now I'm gonna state mine.
Get in the fucking car. Now.
-Let's go. -Yeah, let's go.
-I hate this shortcut. -"I hate this shortcut."
You flinched. Two for flinching.
But you flinched.
I know. Two for flinching.
How are we supposed to get across this?
-We use you as a raft. -Very funny.
Hey, you know, it's not that deep. We can walk across.
I told you we should have stuck to the tracks.
Is it me, or are you the world's biggest pussy?
I suppose this is fun for you.
No, but this is.
-Come on, stop! -Want some more?
-Stop it, come on! -Come on, Teddy, act your age.
This is my age. I'm in the prime of my youth, and I'll only be young once.
Yeah, but you're gonna be stupid for the rest of your life.
-Rank-out! -That's it, Chambers.
You just signed your own death warrant. You die, Chambers.
Get him. Get Vern.
-Vern Tessio dies. -No, Teddy, you're gonna die.
Hey, where do you think you're going, Lachance?
-Yeah, Lachance. -Come on, you guys.
Pile on!
Come on, you guys. I don't wanna do this.
Pile on!
Get off!
-Sleeper hold. Sleeper hold. -Stop it. I'm serious.
-No one gets out of a sleeper hold. -Vern, there's something on your neck.
-Yeah, right, I'm not falling for that one. -Vern, there is something on your neck.
It's a leech. Leeches!
-Oh, my God! -Leeches!
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ!
Oh, my God.
-Get them off! -They're on me!
-Gordie, there's some on your back. -Get them off!
-They're on my legs! -They're on your back!
Are there any on mine, man?
Oh, Chris.
Oh, shit, Chris.
Oh, shit, man.
-Gordie, man, are you okay? -Gordie.
Can you hear me?
Gordie, are you there?
Maybe he's dead.
-He's not. He's still breathing, you idiot. -Well, I don't know.
Just cool it, you guys. He just fainted.
Gordie?
God, I never met anybody who fainted before.
Maybe he made a bad mistake and looked at your face.
Shut up, Teddy.
You okay, Gordie?
-Yeah. -Let's go.
Maybe we should take Gordie back.
Great, Chambers, now you're turning pussy too.
What's your problem? He had a leech hanging from his balls.
What are you, his mother?
-Eat shit. -You eat shit.
Hey, hey, hey.
I think Chris is right. Let's go back.
What a surprise. The king of the pussies wants to go back too.
-Stop calling me that. -What, pussy? Pussy.
-Stop it. -Pussy, pussy, pussy.
-You four-eyed psycho. -Get off me.
Two for flinching. Do you like it? Two for flinching.
-Stop it. -You like it, huh, Teddy?
-Come on, you guys. Break it up. -Stop it. Stop it!
I'm not going back.
-Idiot. -Shut up, retard.
At the time, I didn't know why I needed to see that body so badly.
Even if no one had followed me, I would have gone on alone.
No way, Ace. Not this time, man. No way.
-Go for it, Vince. Go for it. -You want to race? Oh, yeah?
Oh, my God, I got him. I got him.
You are history, guy. History.
-Fall back, Ace. -Come on, don't fuck around.
-Jesus Christ. Fall back. -What are you doing?
Come on, man, don't fuck around.
-Oh, my God. -Come on, Ace, fall back, man!
Shit, man! Shit!
I won.
You let him beat you, you cock-knocker.
Coming through the woods, I bet we saved over an hour.
-Teddy? -Yeah?
This the Back Harlow Road?
Yeah.
The Brower kid must be here someplace.
Teddy, you and Vern watch the left side of the tracks.
-We'll take the right. -All right.
There he is. I see him, look.
Look over there. I see him. I see him.
None of us could breathe.
Somewhere under those bushes was the rest of Ray Brower.
The train knocked Ray Brower out of his Keds...
...just like it had knocked the life out of his body.
Jesus.
The kid wasn't sick.
The kid wasn't sleeping.
The kid was dead.
Let's look for some long branches. We'll build him a stretcher.
Gordie?
Why did you have to die?
-What's the matter with Gordie? -Nothing.
Why don't you guys go look for some branches, okay?
Okay.
Why did he have to die, Chris?
Why did Denny have to die? Why?
I don't know.
-It should have been me. -Don't say that.
-It should have been me. -Don't say that, man.
I'm no good. My dad said it. I'm no good.
He doesn't know you.
-He hates me. -He doesn't hate you.
-He hates me. -No.
He just doesn't know you.
He hates me. My dad hates me.
He hates me. Oh, God.
You're gonna be a great writer someday, Gordie.
You might even write about us guys if you ever get hard up for material.
I guess I'd have to be pretty hard up, huh?
Yeah.
What the fuck do you know about this?
Son of a bitch. My little brother.
You wasn't planning on taking the body from us, was you, boys?
You get away, man.
We found him. We got dibs.
We better start running, Eyeball. They got dibs.
We earned him, man. You guys came in a car. That's not fair. He's ours.
"That's not fair. He's ours."
Well, not anymore.
There are four of us, Eyeball. You just make your move.
Oh, we will. Don't you worry.
Vern, you little son of a whore.
-You was under the porch. -No, I swear it wasn't me.
You peeping bung. I ought to beat the shit out of you.
You guys have two choices.
You either leave quietly and we take the body...
...or you stay and we beat the shit out of you.
And we take the body.
-Besides, me and Billy found him first. -Vern told us how you found him.
"Oh, Billy, I wish we'd never boosted that car."
"Billy, I think I just turned my Fruit of the Looms into a fudge factory."
-That's it. Your ass is grass. -Hold it.
Okay, Chambers, you little faggot. This is your last chance.
What do you say, kid?
Why don't you go home and fuck your mother some more?
You're dead.
Come on, Chris, let's split.
-They're not taking him. -This is crazy.
-They're not taking him. -He's got a knife, man.
Ace, come on, man.
You're gonna have to kill me, Ace.
No problem.
You're not taking him. Nobody's taking him.
Come on, kid, just give me the gun before you take your foot off.
You ain't got the sack to shoot a woodchuck.
Don't move, Ace.
I'll kill you. I swear to God.
Come on, Lachance, give me the gun.
You must have at least some of your brother's good sense.
Suck my fat one, you cheap dime-store hood.
What are you gonna do, shoot us all?
No, Ace, just you.
We're gonna get you for this.
Maybe you will and maybe you won't.
Oh, we will.
We're not gonna forget this, if that's what you're thinking.
This is big time, baby.
"Suck my fat one"?
Whoever told you you had a fat one, Lachance?
Biggest one in four counties.
Yeah.
Are we gonna take him?
No.
But we came all this way. We were supposed to be heroes.
Not this way, Teddy.
Chris, give me a hand.
Ray Brower's body was found...
...but neither our gang nor their gang got the credit.
In the end, we decided that an anonymous phone call...
...was the best thing to do.
We headed home. And although many thoughts raced through our minds...
...we barely spoke.
We walked through the night and made it back...
...a little past 5:00 on Sunday morning, the day before Labor Day.
We'd only been gone two days...
...but somehow the town seemed different, smaller.
Well, see you in school.
Yeah.
Yeah.
See you in junior high.
A penny.
Well, guys, I better get home... ...before my mom puts me on the 10 Most Wanted list.
Hey, Chris?
No hard feelings, okay?
No way, man.
As time went on, we saw less and less of Teddy and Vern...
...until eventually they became just two more faces in the halls.
It happens sometimes.
Friends come in and out of your life like busboys in a restaurant.
I heard Vern got married out of high school, had four kids...
...and is now the forklift operator at the Arsenault Lumber Yard.
Teddy tried to get into the Army... ...but his eyes and his ear kept him out.
Last I'd heard he'd spent some time in jail...
...and was now doing odd jobs around Castle Rock.
I'm never gonna get out of this town, am I, Gordie?
You can do anything you want, man.
Yeah, sure.
Give me some skin.
I'll see you.
Not if I see you first.
Chris did get out.
He enrolled in the college courses with me.
And although it was hard, he gutted it out like he always did.
He went on to college and eventually became a lawyer.
Last week, he entered a fast-food restaurant.
Just ahead of him, two men got into an argument.
One of them pulled a knife.
Chris, who'd always made the best peace, tried to break it up.
He was stabbed in the throat. He died almost instantly.
Dad, can we go now?
-You ready? -Yeah, we've been ready for an hour.
-Miss Flores. -Professor Cale.
Come on in. When did you get in?
A couple of days ago. I've been talking to some guides...
...hoping they might know the whereabouts of our tribe.
Any luck?
There's sufficient evidence to suspect that these people are out there...
...and can be found and studied.
At least, that's what I told the grant people.
My man seems to think the tribe was around here...
...between these tributaries. He'd found one of their markers.
-Well, that's good. -Yep, I think we may have a chance.
You get me there and I'll shoot it.
I'm counting on that. That's why I hired you.
And I'm glad you did. I really appreciate it.
Well, I wanted the best director I could get.
I think we'll make a good team.
You're a mess. What happened to you?
Oh, just a small attack of piranha. Barely escaped with my life.
Somebody's up awfully early.
Yeah, well, today's a good day.
-Is that right? -Oh, yeah.
Not every day my homegirl from SC get to direct her own documentary.
You ready?
-I think so. -That's right.
-Congratulations. -Thanks.
Mateo?
I see you made this a pleasure cruise.
Come on, you know me.
I don't mix business with pleasure.
Okay, well, what about if we go up through here?
This way better. If not, I cannot be responsible.
Okay, well, it's only 55 kilometers out of the way.
Shouldn't be a problem. Better safe than sorry.
-Morning. -Morning.
-Mateo, you understand me? -Sure, I understand.
I'm gonna need you to drift through that channel. I wanna get some shots.
As you say, chefe.
-For your approval. -Thanks.
So where's Westridge? I know he checked in.
He's probably just catching up on his beauty sleep.
Careful!
Careful! Bordeaux. Fragile. Expensive wine.
Christ!
-Morning. -Morning. How was your flight?
Actually, it was a bloody nightmare. Ongoing, I think.
One zoom lens.
You. Stow this in my room, will you?
Excuse me? I'm not the bellhop, I'm the production manager.
Then surely you can manage my things into my room.
One pompous ass.
In some cultures, that's a sign of respect...
...when somebody asks you to carry their bags.
-Respect this, sound man. -It's not me who said that.
-Mr. Westridge, Terri Flores. -Terri, this is a pleasure.
Professor Cale lent me some of your films.
I thought they were very promising.
-God, it's hot. Are we on the equator? -Well, thanks.
Welcome aboard, I guess.
-I think he likes you. -Oh, you felt that too?
Damn, Cale, you look like a little low-budget-ass Jacques Cousteau.
Yeah, well, whatever the hell that means.
It's good to see you, man.
Chefe, ready for Rio Negro.
All right. Double-check your gear, make sure it's all onboard...
...and pray you didn't forget your bug spray.
Our adventure begins 1000 miles from the mouth of the mighty Amazon...
...deep in the heart of the rain forest.
From here, we will travel by river barge...
...up through shallow tributaries and unexplored backwaters...
...in search of the elusive people of the mist:
The Shirishama tribe.
One of the last great mysteries of the rain forest.
Is it just me or does the jungle make you really, really horny?
Oh, no. I think it's the jungle.
I'm serious. I've got, like, one thing on my mind.
Can I work, please?
Help!
Save me! I'm stranded.
My boat is stranded in the roots.
Help me!
Help me! Hello!
Check it out, there's a dude on a boat over there.
Hey! Pull over to his boat.
Stop.
We'll bring you onboard.
Here.
Thank the Lord for you. Thank the Lord.
You hurt?
Are you okay?
My propeller tore off in the roots.
We can't take you back to Manaus. We're headed upriver.
At the next village, I know the people. They help me fix my boat.
-I sorry if I be trouble for you. -There's no need to apologize.
We're all at the mercy of our machines.
Yours broke.
Mateo?
Fish, river-style.
Not bad.
We're gonna have to get that on film next time.
-Ever work in a sushi bar, Mr....? -Serone. Paul Serone.
Where you from, Mr. Serone?
-Paraguay. -Really?
I started out studying for the priesthood...
...but then I needed to see the real world.
So I ended up in the jungle.
I seem to fit.
Tell me, what does a failed priest do in the jungle?
Fail?
Who says I fail?
I didn't fail.
-I'm sure you didn't. -Well, what is your calling now?
-Snakes. -Snakes?
I catch them.
For zoos and collectors. Whatever they want.
Poaching?
Poaching is illegal. May I ask what you are hunting?
We are not hunting or trapping anything.
We're making a documentary on the Shirishama Indians.
-The people of the mist? -That's right. You've heard of them?
I've seen them.
Really? You think you could show me where that was?
You people saved my life. This I can do.
I can show you exactly where I saw the Shirishama.
So slurs every other river rat after five whiskies in any bar in Manaus.
Come on, lovey.
Five whiskies?
That's breakfast on the river.
Well, does salad go well with fish river-style, Mr. Serone?
Salad would be perfect...
...little baby bird.
Okay.
Look at that.
What are those, fireflies?
It's pretty, huh?
Family Lampyridae.
On certain nights they all gather in the same tree...
...and use their night flashes to announce their readiness to mate.
Well, whose flashes, the males or the females?
Both, actually.
The females with a series of short, dainty feminine little flashes...
...about eight per second.
The males respond with a series of long, drawn-out manly flashes.
I like that.
No pick-up lines, no misunderstandings.
Just instinct and nature.
I missed you.
Shit.
Bloody racket.
Hey, hey, hey! Don't touch my radio.
You know, I could cheerfully hire someone to kill you.
A local tribesman, perhaps. Fifteen dollars should cover it.
-I could just kill you for free right now. -Oh, yeah?
-You and whose army? -Your mama's.
So are we getting close?
Just around this bend.
Perfect.
A snake totem.
This totem is Shirishama.
Shirishama worship giant snakes, anacondas...
...as gods, protectors.
There's a legend they pass down of a journey to a sacred lake.
First you must pass a waterfall protected by warrior snakes.
Once you pass those guardians...
...you travel through the land of the Shirishama...
...until you come to a wall so high, it blots out the sky--
Follow that wall for five days, finally reaching its end...
...the head of a giant anaconda.
-You know the story. -Of course.
Beautiful, beautiful legend.
I believe, however, it's a legend of the Maku.
Also the Shirishama.
Not to my knowledge.
The water is high now, but the village was right here.
You'll find them down this fork. I know, I trap snakes for a living.
And I'm sure you're very good at it.
I locate tribes for a living and I'm very good at that.
The water level is high, which by my calculations means...
...the areas to this side will be flooded...
...which would force our tribe, if they wanted to eat...
...to seek out higher ground. So over here.
Which way?
We'll go this way.
Westridge, I wanna get a shot of you with the totem.
And, Gary, you're gonna roll sound.
-Camera rolling. -Action.
Our first piece of luck: a Shirishama idol...
...although this is the subject of some dispute.
I know what I know. You can accept it or reject it.
-Leave me at the next village. -Cut.
With pleasure.
What the hell was that all about?
We're gonna go out and get some wild sound.
Well, just be careful.
We will.
See you guys.
All right.
Gary....
It's unbelievable.
-Gary? -What?
Oh, my God.
No, wait.
Do you hear that?
The silence.
Run, Gary!
-What was that? -I don't know.
Mateo, shine the light over there.
These two are fortunate to be alive.
-What happened? -You guys okay?
Man, you should have seen it. What a shot.
This guy just blasted this thing coming right at us.
Wild boar.
Gores with his tusks. Goes for the eyes.
-Denise, are you okay? -Yeah, thanks.
From now on, everybody stays onboard at night, all right?
-No exceptions. -That's a smart idea.
Mateo, let's cut him up. Food for a week.
Food?
-My turn? -No, it's my turn.
-No, it isn't. -Yeah, it is.
Mateo, do you have control of this vessel?
Lie, if you must.
Mateo.
Goddamn rope's caught in the propeller.
Well, looks like I'm gonna have to cut us loose.
It's maybe better I do it. This river can kill you in 1000 ways.
I can handle it. The only thing I'm really afraid of...
-Okay. -...is the candiru acu.
"Can do" what?
Candiru acu. It's a tiny little catfish.
It swims up into your urethra, finds a nice warm spot...
...spreads its thorny little spines and refuses to budge.
You have to cut it out.
That's it, man. I'm getting the hell back to L.A.
Terri, something's wrong!
Oh, my God.
Cale?
-He's hurt. I'm going. -Hold up, hold on. Hold it, I got it.
Gary.
Hurry up.
Come on, guys. Come on.
Steven? Oh, my God.
Is he breathing?
Faster, come on. Is he all right? Is he okay?
-Hurry. -Oh, my God.
-Dan, be careful. -What is it?
-It's okay. -What is it?
Take his mask off. Be careful, be careful.
-Get something for his head. -Okay.
-He's not breathing. -Move him.
He's not breathing.
-Something for his head. -Here.
There's something in the mouth.
Oh, dear God.
Oh, damn. What's that?
Oh, God.
A wasp.
Deadly.
Poisonous.
Well, he's still not breathing. What are we gonna do?
-Oh, God. How did this happen? -Alcohol.
I've got whiskey in my flask.
-Quickly. -What's that for? What are you---?
-He's breathing. He's breathing. -That's it. He's gonna be all right.
Here.
He seems okay. We should go now.
Man, that radio don't work. We have no communication.
Hey, I can't fix, okay?
-We can start now. -No, no, no.
Fog.
We don't get this man to a hospital soon...
...we might as well throw him in the river.
What?
Terri, we got lights.
Good. Mateo, we're just gonna double back.
Fighting the current, lose two days.
Cut back to this tributary, save us 50 miles.
This is the route you suggested we take yesterday.
Yesterday for a different reason.
Now our concern is getting Professor Cale to a hospital...
...as fast as possible.
Fine.
I hope you know what you're doing...
...because I don't know about this dude.
What choice do I have?
What the hell is this?
Hey, Terri, come here.
This is the river you know?
No, this is new.
But no cause for panic.
I'm not panicking, I'm just looking at this wall...
...that's blocking our way down this river that you know.
Well, let's just see what we can do.
Hey, is that real dynamite?
-It's always good to be prepared. -Prepared for what?
Well, you gotta be kidding me. That thing must be there for a reason.
Yeah, to keep us out.
I'm talking about upsetting the ecological balance of this river.
Well, look, I can blow it in 10 minutes...
...or if you feeling sensitive, we can turn around and lose two days.
It's up to you.
Terri?
Oh, for God's sake, blow the bloody thing.
Just give me 10 minutes, people. Ten minutes.
I'm gonna need some help. Gary, get the little boat.
-There's something down there. -That's right.
-No, I really mean it. -I really mean it too.
Hurry!
Shit.
Goddamn it. These snakes.
Oh, God.
Babies. All of them babies.
Well, how do we get them off the boat?
Come on, babies. Come on, back to your mama. Come on.
Come on.
Some of these aren't babies.
Mateo, there's more right here.
Calm.
-You little shit. -Serone, help him get it off.
Someone get this bloody thing off my freaking hand!
Get it off!
So young and yet so lethal.
Get it off me. Come on.
Later, sweetie.
You knew there were snakes here, didn't you, Serone?
It was a pleasant surprise.
What about the fuel?
There's only one drum left.
That's enough for about 100 kilometers.
About a day's ride. Well, that will have to do.
Go, go. Back to your mother.
Hey.
Hi.
How's he doing?
-He's breathing normally now. -That's good.
We'll get him home.
I just don't know what's going on, you know?
Serone's supposed to help us get back to the hospital, right?
And he acts like he owns this river.
And we run into a barrier full of snakes.
I mean, where is he taking us?
Mateo. Mateo! Stop the boat.
-Stop it. -Why are we stopping now?
Could be fuel.
You know that boat?
There's lots of boats like that.
Hello?
I get the distinct impression there's nobody home.
Mateo?
Come with me.
Hold up.
I'm gonna get this on film.
-You don't need sound, do you? -No, I'm not gonna go over there.
Go aft.
Serone?
-Kind of spooky in here. -You think so?
What the...?
Goddamn.
-Help me with this. -What's that?
Treasures.
Here.
Hey, be careful. I put my camera in here.
Mateo, that's it. Let's go.
Hey, I'm coming. I'm coming.
-What's all this? -And what about the fuel?
There wasn't no fuel.
-Great. -Where's Mateo?
I don't know. He was right behind us.
Mateo!
-I'm going back. -Serone, go with him.
Maybe some other time.
Asshole.
Stuck in the middle of nowhere and now we've lost the driver.
Mateo.
Come on, man. Stop playing.
Danny?
Danny!
Danny?
-Yeah. -You okay?
I'm all right.
I didn't see him.
How very reassuring.
Here, this is it.
-This is all you found? -Yeah.
-What the hell is this? -Anaconda skin.
-There's snakes out there this big? -This skin is three or four years old.
Whatever's shed it has grown since then.
But something like this has made a meal of our dear captain.
What?
-Snakes don't eat people. -Oh, they don't?
Anacondas are a perfect killing machine.
They have heat sensors.
A warm body like Mateo's in the water wasn't hard to find.
They strike, wrap around you, hold you tighter than your true love.
And you get the privilege of hearing your bones break...
...before the power of the embrace causes your veins to explode.
-No, Mateo's probably just lost. -Oh, wake up.
Imagine something this big, captured alive.
That's worth a lot of money, Gary.
Jesus.
Please, people...
...don't make me out a monster.
I didn't eat the captain Mateo.
Come on, everybody.
We are not sure that Mateo is dead.
-So we'll just wait here till morning. -Are you insane?
Where do you think he went, a walk in the woods?
We've got to get the hell out of here.
-Oh, get a grip, Westridge. -I've got a grip.
If it was you out there, you'd want us to stay too.
Listen, if it was me out there, I'd be dead, don't you see?
Just go into your cabin and lock the door.
Like a bad boy. All right. All right.
Where are my shoes? Where are my shoes?
-We're gonna aim lights at the boat. -That's a good idea.
Lights are a good idea.
I'm not so sure he didn't eat the captain.
He sure looks satiated.
Think he's still alive?
-No. Let's go to bed. -Okay.
Danger.
Danger is exciting, huh, Gary?
You go to bed, I'm gonna catch up to you.
-Gary, come on. -I'm just gonna talk to him a second.
-Well, hurry up, I'm scared. -I'll be right there.
-So it's out there, isn't it? -Yeah.
-You know how to catch these things? -That's right.
But you can't catch an anaconda by yourself.
You need a partner.
Capture alive...
...maybe a million dollars, Gary.
Still no Mateo.
Keep it steady, Westridge.
Steady it.
Man, what the fuck are you doing?
You can't catch anacondas without bait.
Oh, my God.
-Westridge, let's go. -No, Westridge. Stop. Not on my boat.
Your boat? You speak for everybody?
Gary? She speak for everybody?
Gary?
Well, I mean, the way I figure it, with Cale messed up, the movie's off.
Why not salvage something?
You know, let's film Serone capturing a big snake.
-Have you lost your mind? -Have I lost my mind?
No, I haven't. If anything, I'm completely lucid right now.
It's you guys who need to open up your eyes.
Yo, hold up.
How we go from taking Cale to the hospital...
-...to catching a goddamn snake? -Do you know where you are?
You're in the middle of the jungle.
Okay, all you guys do is you question and you criticize...
...but remember, you don't know shit about the shit we're in.
And neither do I, okay?
But I guarantee you I know who does: this guy.
Paul has been here.
And if we help him catch the snake...
...then he will help us get out of here alive.
And that, amigos, is not insanity. That is common freaking sense.
Come on, Gary, this-- This isn't you.
-Honey, what did he do to you? -Stop, okay?
Think about how much money this will be worth.
Imagine capturing something like this on film for the first time ever.
-What else are we supposed to do? -I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm about to throw both of you son of bitches in the river myself.
-I don't think so. -I didn't want this to happen, people.
-Let's go, Westridge. -Okay.
Gary.
Occupy yourselves. Play some cards.
Nobody move.
Gary! Gary, get the lights.
Westridge, stop the boat. Stop it.
-Get it over here, Westridge. -You're gonna get us all killed.
That's it, that's it.
Go for the eyes.
-Go for the eyes. Blind it. -Oh, man.
He's fishing for snakes. The man gotta be crazy.
Just let it go.
Westridge, come here. Come down here.
Danny!
Westridge.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Don't move. I'll get it with the tranquillizer.
Denise, get up here. Get up here.
Gary, help me.
-Get out of there. -Grab her, man.
I'm stuck.
Grab her hand.
The snake, it's in the water!
Let's go!
-Gary! -I got you.
Gary, give me your hand.
Gary!
-Gary! -No!
It's no good to me dead.
Gary!
Oh, God!
Gary!
May the souls of the faithful departed...
...through the mercy of God rest in peace. Amen.
-Westridge. -How dare you?
It was you who brought that snake.
You brought the devil.
There's the devil inside everyone.
-Get your hands off her. -Horrible.
-Westridge! -What?
Take my gear up to the pilot house.
I'm not your bloody poodle.
What you say?
How dare you presume to order me about?
Presume?
How you like I presume to throw you in the river? You like that?
Take it upstairs.
Thank you.
Everyone else, don't move.
Get back.
Get back.
Terri, let's talk.
You want something?
I just want to talk to you.
I was thinking about the myth.
I don't know if you know, but this....
This film was supposed to be my big break.
And it's turned out to be a big disaster.
Anyway, I was just thinking...
...that maybe I could film you...
...capturing the snake and then...
...it wouldn't have all been for nothing.
I don't know. It could be dangerous.
Well, I know.
But at least you'd be there to protect us.
You need protection?
Yeah.
It's been a long time...
...since I had a woman.
You think I'm stupid?
I'm not stupid.
-It worked. -Asshole in one.
-Shall I hit him again? -Let's throw him in the river.
-Haven't we had enough of that? -I'm ashamed to say I enjoyed it.
Come on, let's just tie him up, okay?
This was all one big setup, huh?
Mateo, you stranded...
...the shipwrecked boat, your route to the hospital.
How can you forget about the wasp?
See, what you do is not so hard.
I can trap a snake too.
As smart as you are, you can't survive without me.
Hey, we're gonna be home soon, okay?
I can't believe how good you're doing. Hang in there, baby.
Is it hard to drive?
It's a doddle, like driving a Cadillac Fleetwood.
Tell you what, I'll give you a driving lesson.
Right, black knobs:
up to go forward, down to go back.
Red knobs: up to go fast, down to go slow.
Wheel: four turns hard over, left and right.
If you get into trouble, turn off the ignition, all right?
-Take it for a spin. -That's it?
Take us back to civilization.
Shit, no problem.
Take us back to...
...crisp sheets and hot showers.
The playoffs and a six-pack.
Eighteen holes of golf and a quadruple gin and tonic.
L.A. traffic and my cellular phone.
Don't start.
The waterfall.
It's a beautiful sight, baby bird.
The legend was right.
What is this place?
Oh, dear.
It's absolutely beautiful.
-What was that? -I think we hit the bottom.
-We did. -Hey.
Turn the wheel hard over left.
Right. Put it in reverse.
Shut it down.
Shit.
We got to winch ourselves loose.
Whoa, what are you doing?
-We have to get in the water? -We ain't got much choice.
I figure me and you go over here, wrap a rope around that tree.
You, you wrap a rope around that tree.
Pull it tight. If not, we're stuck here forever.
We've got to make it quick, in and out.
I rather hoped I'd done my bit.
That's our rope right there.
-Just enough to go around the tree? -Yeah.
We'll take this, get it around that trunk right there.
-Make sure it's secure. -Roger.
-Hate this. -Last time I was in water like this...
...I was up all night picking leeches off my scrotum.
Aren't you gonna pray?
Never look in the eyes of those you kill.
They will haunt you forever. I know.
I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace...
...to confess my sins...
...and to amend my life. Amen.
Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus...
...baby bird.
Okay.
Hurry up.
Back on the boat. Now.
Come on! Go.
Christ.
Get on the boat. Go on, hurry.
-Come on. Come on. -Quick!
-Get up. -Hurry, it's there!
Get up!
Over here, you fat-assed bastard.
Shit.
-Westridge, go up the rocks! -Go!
Get up the rocks!
It's coming. Go!
-Go get the gun. -What are we gonna do?
Go get it.
Hurry up.
Come on, man.
Westridge, keep going, man.
Danny, watch out!
Danny, move your arm.
Westridge!
Look out!
Danny?
Danny! Danny!
Yeah?
Westridge? Westridge?
Shit.
Come on, hurry up.
I'm caught.
Come on, Danny. Hurry up.
Come on.
Danny!
No!
Danny!
Danny, hold on.
Hold on.
Come on.
You killed my warrior snake.
Get up.
The dart.
The tranquillizer's working. Get him.
Damn, the dart came out his back.
Come on, almost there.
All right.
Baby?
He lost consciousness again.
I'm gonna try to get us out of here.
-The tree knocked us loose. -All right.
Hey, Terri, look.
They might have some fuel for us.
Let's check it out.
-Need some help? -No, I'm cool.
I don't even wanna know what happened here.
Me neither.
I hope they got some fuel, though.
Damn.
Those drums. Could be fuel.
A snake skin.
-Look, there's plenty of fuel in here. -Welcome.
Time to wake up.
Monkey blood.
I'm gonna kill you, Serone! I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you!
Don't get me upset.
See this?
Human bones.
That's how it comes out.
Ashes to ashes....
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Look.
Up, on your feet. Come on.
Go.
Gotcha.
Come on.
Get loose.
Let's get the fuel and get the hell out of here.
Don't worry, just go.
Run. It's coming for you.
Danny, where are you?
-There's a whole nest up there. -I'll have him chase me.
-No, I've got the legs. -Okay, we can trap it there.
Okay.
Go. Go!
Hey! Can you climb up the top?
-I can use the rope. -Hurry up, I think I can blow him up.
-I'm about to light it. -Go ahead, I'm at the top.
-Danny! -Okay.
Danny!
-Get out, the fuse is lit. -Danny, wait!
Push it on the side! Hit the hinges!
Hurry up! You gotta jump!
-I can't, it's too high. -Just jump!
I got you. Come on.
Did we get him? Did we get him?
We got him.
You all right?
Yeah.
We should get the fuel...
...so we can get the hell out of here, all right?
Come on.
Come on!
Bitch.
Let's get out of here.
Miss Flores.
You're a mess.
Found another one.
Here, let me see that.
Shirishama.
Serone was right.
Danny.
Damn.
I'll get the camera.
Wishing and hoping

All you gotta do is hold him

Two and two, menu.
Brian, 22! Immediately!
-Guillermo! Guillermo! -Yes, sir!
-Two pigeons! -Two pigeons!
-Right away! -Right away!
V.I.P.
Very important table right here!
Give me two grain!
-I'll take that polenta! -Polenta, chef.
This is the one! This is the one I'm waiting for. Right here.
-Yes, sir! -I need that special meat right now!
-Yes, chef! -Pastry, get ready. It's coming at you.
I will kill your whole family if you don't get this right.
-I need this perfect. -Yes, sir.
I'm writing it up as
inventive and confident.
By the way, did the chap from Newsday ever call?
I'll check my machine.
Is this a real interview,
or just some cute guy that you're trying to set me up with?
Please, Julianne, I don't send you men anymore.
You haven't got the first idea what to do with them.
Hey, it's Michael. Jules, it must be months, huh?
So, I can't wait to talk to you. I'm in Chicago at the Drake Hotel.
I guess I'm...
Okay, well, call me, 4:00 in the morning, whatever. We gotta talk. Bye.
Who called? The man of the moment?
No, the opposite.
It's my Michael. Michael O'Neal.
He sounds desperate to talk to me.
The wandering sportswriter. Remind me about that one.
Sophomore year at Brown.
-We had this one hot month. -One hot month.
Yes, but, of course, you know me.
I got restless.
So, I get up the nerve to break his heart,
and he gives me this look.
And he said, "The thing that makes me wanna cry is
"I'm losing the best friend I ever had."
At that moment, I knew I felt the same way.
So, I cried for maybe the third time in my entire life,
kissed him,
and we've been best friends ever since.
We've seen each other through everything.
Losing jobs,
losing parents, losing lovers.
We've traveled all over.
Best times of my life, maybe.
Drinking and talking,
even if it's just over the phone.
Go on. This is so moving. Kindred spirits?
No, he's nothing like me.
He's like you, actually, only straight.
I remember this one night in Tucson, like, six years ago.
He takes a razor out of this tiny little Dopp kit, cuts his finger,
takes my hand, does the same to me.
-I'm going to be sick. -He says, "Swear.
When we're 28, if we've never married, we marry each other."
We never talked about it again.
I don't know what made me think of that.
You're about to be 28 in three weeks, right?
How old is he?
You think?
Desperate to talk.
No.
Cheers.
Hey, it's Michael. Jules, it must be months, huh?
I can't wait to talk to you. I'm in Chicago at the Drake Hotel.
I guess I'm...
Okay, well, call me, 4:00 in the morning, whatever. We gotta talk. Bye.
Good evening, the Drake Hotel.
Hi. Yes, I'm... I'm calling for Michael O'Neal.
But seeing as it's so late,
-if you could let me leave... -One moment, please.
Hello?
Hello.
You've been enrolled in the obscene caller of the month club.
Hey, beautiful.
It's so great to hear your voice. I miss you.
I've been calling you for over a month, you know.
Well, I've been on a book tour.
Well, I figured you were out of town.
No, I mean, my machine eats all my messages and...
Or you're just averaging 30 days to return a call.
Well, it's less when it's you.
Look, I have to ask you something, something incredibly important.
And if you turn me down, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
You know, if I could just tell you one thing first.
Well, this is... This is probably
going to hand you the biggest laugh of your adult life, I'm sure.
But I was thinking about you, and I was remembering this
unbelievably insane night that we spent in Tucson,
like, I don't know, 1,000 years ago.
And you probably won't remember this, but...
Are you kidding? I think about that night all the time.
You do?
But it's not why I called.
It's not?
I called because I met someone.
Well,
that's great, that's great.
'Cause you haven't really seen anybody, have you, since dingbat Jenny Lee?
No, you don't understand.
I've never felt this way about anybody. And she's all wrong for me.
Well, there's a good start.
No, I mean, she's a junior at the University of Chicago. She's 20.
Her name's Kim, Jules. You're gonna love her. She's beautiful.
And her dad is this billionaire,
and he owns the White Sox and some cable empire.
And you know I've always been kind of uncomfortable around rich people.
Sure.
But they're not like that. They're such wonderful people, really.
Salt of the earth.
So, you've... You've met her parents.
Yeah.
Jules, we're getting married this Sunday.
-Hello? -Michael. Michael.
Hello?
Michael, it's Wednesday night.
How can you possibly be getting married on Sunday?
Actually, it all starts tomorrow,
and it's one of these four-day weddings with all the traditional events,
and, like, 10 million people flying in from all over the world.
Okay, okay, okay, but aren't you working this weekend?
I mean, is that responsible?
Well, the Sox are at home, and Sports is letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.
You know, on Frank Thomas...
Wait. What do you mean, "irresponsible"? Taking off a weekend to get married?
Jules, I'm scared.
Maybe we should talk about this.
I need you.
If you can't come and hold my hand, I'll never get through this.
Please come.
-Please. -Well...
Oh, man, I can't wait for you to meet her.
UNITED AIRLINES
Listen, Jules, why don't we just stop and have a drink?
-You can take a later flight. -No, no, no, no. I'm a busy girl.
I've got exactly four days to break up a wedding,
steal the bride's fella, and I haven't one clue how to do it.
He adored me for nine goddamn years. Me!
I can see why.
Look, she has known him for what, like, five seconds?
Okay, plus, she's got billions of dollars.
Plus, she's apparently perfect, okay?
So don't go feeling all sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois.
I can't lose him, George. I'm gonna bring him back.
Hey, hey, there you are.
Over here! Jude!
Hi!
Can you believe I'm gonna do this?
Not hardly.
This just makes everything so perfect!
From the day I met Michael,
all I've heard is "Julianne this" and "Julianne that."
I've never had a sister.
Right off, I have this monstrous favor to ask you.
-Excuse me? -My best friend Angelique
shattered her pelvis line dancing in Abilene over spring break.
Be my maid of honor?
What?
Shouldn't you promote a bridesmaid
or someone that you've known at least 45 minutes?
My bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under the age of 40.
Debutante sisters from Nashville who are basically vengeful sluts.
Oh, my exit!
So this means I have four days to make you my new best friend.
It's time for you to force yourself to get personal.
-Do you like the color? -I think it's beautiful.
-Isn't that perfect for her? -Absolutely.
Now, this is going to be tighter.
-You don't want those things to fall out. -No, it's beautiful.
I'm not hurting you, okay?
I don't want her to trip,
so I'm going to take this up a little tiny, tiny bit.
Would you rather the daffodil?
I thought the bridesmaids all wore the same dress?
Not you.
You wouldn't be comfortable unless you were distinctive.
What else did he tell you?
You hate weddings. You never go.
You're not up for anything conventional
or anything that's assumed to be a female priority,
including marriage, romance or even...
Love?
Michael and I were a wrong fit right from the start.
He said that, too.
Well, I thought I was like you and proud to be.
Till I met rumpled, smelly old Michael.
Then I found I was just a sentimental schmuck
like all those flighty nitwits I'd always pitied.
It's funny, huh?
Yeah.
I need a cigarette.
George, how do you think I feel?
All she does is talk about her and Michael's future.
And she's just so bright-eyed and dreamy.
Fuck, the door. Jules, pull yourself together.
Yeah! And I don't know if I can do it.
Hi. Hi.
Want me to turn around or something?
-Yes. -Jules?
Not the person I was expecting.
I've seen you a lot more naked than that.
Well, things are...
Things are different now.
Yeah. Guess so.
Yeah.
You look really good without your clothes on.
Jules?
George,
she's toast.
-So the honeymoon is where, exactly? -Well, it depends.
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there,
or Phoenix, or depending on the Indiana-Cleveland game...
Garden spots, all.
A swing of maybe 40 degrees Fahrenheit represents a packing challenge,
but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suites.
It's his career. I'm supportive.
Look, I've been everywhere. I wanna be with the man I love.
That's what makes it a honeymoon.
I'm just saying he's lucky.
Takes one woman in a billion to put up with his array of shit.
The guy's a one-man festival of idiosyncratic...
Well, you've been introduced to the symphonic range...
Of his snoring? Yeah. He says it's worse than ever.
-You know that snarfle one? -Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Now it's kind of got like this phlegm-rattling thing happening behind it.
Guess what? Earplugs work.
-Oh, what about... -His cigars in bed?
I broke him of that habit.
But the bathroom's a swamp. He wears Reeboks to dinner.
He likes action movies.
He reads over my shoulder.
He loves karaoke bars, for God's sake, and I can't carry a tune.
Really?
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
That's a trademark move.
Don't touch that one.
But he sure can kiss.
You know, it's been a while.
I'm just gonna take your word on that.
After two weeks of cataloging all of his faults,
I made a command decision that changed my life.
I threw the list away.
He's not a balance sheet. He's Michael, and loving him means loving all of him.
You get nervous in small, confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to want to be protective,
but nothing ever could, ever did give me one moment's pause about this marriage.
Do you become hysterical in small, confined...
Except one.
You.
You'll always be there in his mind,
this perfect creature that he loved for all those years.
Well, perfection can get wearing after a while.
I'm not kidding. I had to face up to all of my competitive drives.
And believe me, I've got them.
-No! -After all, what am I gonna be?
Jealous of you for the rest of my life?
-Our paths will keep on crossing. -Space. Of course.
-He'll always talk about you. -It's only natural.
And the answer was so simple.
I was gonna predict that.
You win.
I've missed a step.
He's got you on a pedestal
and me in his arms.
My God, it's the bride and the woman she'll never live up to.
Are you okay, honey?
-I'm so sorry. -That would be us.
Did she say the wrong thing again? That is so in character.
-I'm Julianne Potter. -We'd be the vengeful sluts.
But you can just call us eager.
Hey, have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?
As M of H, you get first pick.
Don't pick the short, hairy, fat one. He's mine.
Kimmy's a virgin.
-Is this Michael's Julianne? -Yes.
I'm Isabelle Wallace,
and my handsome new son scarcely did you justice, girl.
Now, my husband says we should scoot you over to the ballpark
so you can hang with Michael.
But first you have to meet a lot of really old women.
That is, if you've absorbed enough profanity.
Come on! One strike!
Which of you gents ordered a beer?
Oh, let me help you with that.
Michael, you unwittingly imply that I'm clumsy.
Sorry, I was confusing you with somebody I used to know.
Julianne Potter, this is Hank and Eric from Sport magazine.
-Nice to meet you. -They were kind enough to give me a job.
-Hi, there. -How do you do?
And this is Walter, my father-in-law.
Future father-in-law.
COMISKEY PARK
Thank you.
If he gives you any grief, you come and see me.
And this guy you know.
Papa Joe.
I told him he should make you best man, darling,
but he had to go with his baby brother.
-Best-looking guy in any room! -Hello!
-Great to see you. -Hey, that'll do.
Scotty... Scotty, that'll do.
Sorry.
Now, remember, it is the duty of the best man
to dance with the maid of honor.
Dance. You can't dance.
When did you learn how to dance?
I've got moves you've never seen.
You're an impostor.
What did you do with my best friend?
I'm still your best friend.
You just haven't seen me for a while.
All I'm saying is that some people might find
that kind of perfection boring day after day, year after year...
See, that's what I thought at first. How can you like someone that perfect?
No potential for long-range likability.
But then she does have a few good traits.
-Oh, now... -Such as?
They got him.
When I hug her, even in public, I don't have to let go right away.
She lets me hold her as long as I want.
Batting second, the shortstop.
-What? -Nothing.
Yeah, I forgot.
You and that yucky love stuff.
You always get like that when it gets sentimental.
I do not!
Okay.
Well, when we were...
When you and I were...
-When we were... -Together?
Yeah.
Well, did I... When...
Yes.
"Yes" what?
Yes, you pulled away when I tried to hug you in public.
Well, I've changed.
I mean, I'm not the girl that I once was.
Really?
Any relationship over two weeks I should know about?
This is not about longevity, Michael.
This is about
being comfortable
with the yucky love stuff.
All right.
And I am.
Karaoke!
-Where'd you find this place? -The doorman told me.
And you are singing the song.
All right!
I didn't realize this was a karaoke bar.
This is so great. My two best girls.
You folks thirsty?
Margarita.
-Blended, no salt. -She wants it straight up.
-And you? -Amstel Light.
Two words for you.
-Margarita. -Yeah.
Vespa.
-Florence. -Yeah.
Me hanging on in the rain all night.
I love Florence.
And the guy with the thing...
"Where's my pass?"
"No! The pier is for fishing!"
-"French kissing?" -"Fishing!"
I've always loved Florence.
You should take her there.
She's perky. She deserves a honeymoon.
-Oh, yeah, well... -"Oh, yeah, well..."
"If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento..."
What is that? I mean, you're off the road in September.
And when does fall quarter start for you?
I'm not coming back senior year.
Don't architects find a degree sort of an asset?
I travel every week.
Got college ball, motor sports, training camps.
I think the most important thing is for us to be together.
Say, pinky, I wanna hear you sing.
-Come on. -No, thank you.
No, Kimmy hates to sing. She hates it.
Oh, yeah?
-All right, folks. -Michael, no.
Everybody, my bride-to-be here is about to kick some ass.
-What? No, it'll be fun. -No, no, no, no.
No, no, no. Michael. She doesn't want to, Michael. Leave her alone.
Come on.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Please give it up for the dazzling vocal stylings of
Miss Kimberly Wallace!
Come on!
I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
I'm so used to doing
Everything for you
You suck!
Planning everything for two
Next!
And now that we're through
I just don't know what to do with my time
You suck!
I'm so lonesome for you It's a crime
Going to the movies
Only makes me sad
Parties make me feel as bad
When I'm not with you
I don't know what to do
I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
If your new love ever turns you down
Come back I will be around
Just waiting for you
I just don't know what to do
Like a summer rose
All right.
Yeah!
I need your sweet love
I need your sweet love
To ease
All the pain
That was just terrible!
Terrible!
You won't be lonely without us?
Desperately.
Maybe we don't have to go.
Your grandmother's dinner? As bride-to-be, she's got you on a technicality.
I'd babysit you,
but my loyalty is to the bride in her time of need.
It's not really a time of need.
Okay, well, if you're sure.
Sure?
Yeah, I mean, I'll stay with Michael if you're sure.
Okay.
Call me later?
Of course.
Bye.
Have fun!
You were pretty shocked when I told you, huh?
Shocked? No.
-A little. -Okay.
A lot.
I fell off the bed.
Well, that explains the thump.
You like her, don't you?
Yeah, I do.
That's enthusiastic.
Well, I mean...
No, she's... She's great.
"No. She's great."
I mean, seriously can't sing a note.
But...
to make that kind of sacrifice.
What?
Leaving school?
All of it.
Putting her career on hold.
All to follow you around in this dumb job
where you travel, like, 52 weeks a year
to places like College Station, Texas.
Dumb job?
Well, it's not a grown-up job, Michael.
My job never bothered you before.
It doesn't bother me now, but I'm not Kimmy.
Her father owns the Sox and cable sports.
Yeah?
I'm just surprised it hasn't come up, that's all.
What "it"? What?
Corner office with a view.
You in a nice blue suit, permanent Chicago address.
-Somewhat close to Mom and Dad. -No.
Never.
She would never even think of that.
You don't know her.
But Michael loves his job.
Sure, bad games, bad pay, bad towns, bad flights, bad hotels.
Real bad food, homeless, rootless, lonely.
Your copy makes it in maybe one issue out of four.
What's not to love?
Why would he trade all that for running, say,
a piece of the PR at a powerful complex conglomerate like your father's?
That's just the sort of thing my father and I discussed.
I'm not surprised.
So, do you think he'd really accept?
Michael? A job like that?
By any yardstick that involved sanity,
it'd be the greatest thing that ever happened to him.
Present company excepted.
This is what we do.
-We make your dad a co-conspirator. -Kim.
Michael does a favor for Walter.
Walter's reorganizing his public relations
and needs a brilliant guy that he's close to
that he can completely trust.
Then you beg. "Michael, please do this for Daddy.
It's only six months. It would mean so much to me."
He'll see right through it.
Only if he wants to.
At the end of six months, he will be happy,
settled, successful.
-You look beautiful. -Thank you.
Do you have a date later or something?
Never can tell.
Hi.
Just the way you look tonight
Remember?
Okay, kid, you're up.
Well, it's really my father who needs the favor.
You see, he's reorganizing some of the divisions of the company.
Public relations is a real problem area for him.
It would only be six months, maybe.
-Or three or four. -And you knew about this?
Well, I think you ought to listen to her, Michael.
It's her life, too.
Well, you gonna tell me that Walter thought this one up?
Why don't you start by being honest for one second, Kim?
I am being honest.
What? All of a sudden I'm supposed to drop out of school,
forget my family, forget my career,
forget about all the things I had planned for my life?
Forgive me for screwing up your plans.
I'm glad I'm hearing about this now, before it's too late.
-What is that supposed to mean? -What am I supposed to do with my life?
I work in a low-paying, zero-respect job, which, unfortunately, I happen to love.
Michael, it sounds like a great opportunity.
Does it really?
How come you never took some sellout establishment job?
I'll tell you why, because that isn't you.
And guess what, Kim, that's not me either.
Okay, if that's the way you feel...
You're damn straight that's how I feel!
Just come out and say it.
My job's not good enough.
I'm not good enough.
Michael, I never said that.
Yes, you did.
Great, Kim.
You wait till two days before our wedding to lay this on me,
and I'm supposed to just roll over and drool.
No.
Fine. I'm the asshole.
I'm an insensitive sexist asshole!
-You're better off without me. -No, Michael! No!
You're so... So right.
I was so wrong.
We settled this, and I reneged. That just wasn't fair.
You have to forgive me and forget this ever happened.
Okay? Or I'll just die! Please!
I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry. -No, no.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -I'm sorry.
I love you.
George and Werner are not in.
Brevity is the order of the day.
George! Answer this, damn it!
I'm in a meltdown here!
She double-crossed me!
The little twerp groveled!
She's so wrong for him.
Michael and I are the same person.
Self-absorbed and vaguely lovable.
We deserve each other.
I'm running out of time. I'm completely out of sneaky ideas.
I have come to the end of my rapidly fraying rope!
George, you have got to think of something!
-Coffee, anyone? -Yes.
-I think that's in order. -That would be nice.
The Drake
The plane! The plane!
-Good morning, Tattoo. -Good morning, boss.
Isn't it a glorious morning?
If you say so.
George!
This is very Marcel Marceau.
Now, relax, relax. We don't want your face coming off with it, do we?
What a hideous room.
Oh, God.
Death by mini-bar, how glamorous.
You flew all the way here. You hate to fly.
And I have to get back this evening.
We have this thing with Werner's family in the Hamptons.
You're butting in.
What I mean when I say she's annoyingly perfect
is that there's nothing annoying about her perfection.
It is vulnerable and endearing, and that is annoying as shit.
And you like her.
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
This is my whole life's happiness.
I have to be ruthless.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.
I can make him happier than she can.
Yes, I am breaking her heart in the short run,
but really, really doing her a gigantic favor.
She would be so miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus.
Jules,
do you really love him,
or is this just about winning?
Seriously.
In the beginning, it was mostly this prior claim.
He belonged to me.
But now, when I'm with him,
he's just so wonderful.
How come I never knew that when I could have had him?
It's amazing the clarity that comes with psychotic jealousy.
George, believe me,
if he was feeling what I'm feeling,
then he would know how I feel.
It's horrible.
What?
Just tell him you love him.
Julianne, tell him...
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid of love.
Yeah, tell him you were afraid of love, afraid of needing.
-Needing what? -To belong to someone.
We all are, sweetheart.
I'm sorry about that.
Tell him...
Tell him this is the worst, cruelest, dumbest moment to do this to him,
but there it is.
He's got to choose.
Tell him the actual truth?
Well, maybe not the actual truth.
Highlights.
Oh, George.
Keep your arms at your sides, please.
Okay.
Good morning.
Michael, I have to talk to you.
You don't like the suit?
Actually, no, but that's not what I have to talk about.
Okay, one thing first, though. Excuse me.
Guard this with your life.
What is it?
The ring.
Why are you giving it to me?
I don't trust Scotty with it.
-Michael, I don't think I should... -Please. Please.
You're practically the best man anyway.
-Thank you. -Here, open it.
She'll like it, won't she?
Yes.
So, what'd you want to talk about?
What?
You wanted to talk to me about something?
Oh, yes, Michael,
we've known each other a long time, right? What, 20 years?
Okay, not that long, but it's a long time.
Yeah.
And in that time, we've grown...
Close.
Very close. Do you know what I mean by "close"?
-I think so. -Okay, good, so do I.
So, sometimes, when...
Could you excuse us, please?
Sometimes people think
they know how they feel about each other,
but they don't
until...
Until they do.
I have a point.
The question is, am I getting to it?
Why don't you? Whatever it is you have to say can't be that big a deal.
Oh, Michael, you know, "a big deal" is...
Is a relative term...
Who's that guy?
It's George. George. George.
I've told you about George. He's my editor.
What's he doing here? You working this weekend?
No.
He's here to be with me.
Why?
Because he's my friend. He's... He's my good friend.
My best friend these days, and...
You've been busy.
So, all of this... This has been about George?
I'm speechless.
Well, that's Jules.
Yeah. Hey...
Congratulations.
What?
I told him, puppy.
I mean, if we're engaged, we really shouldn't be ashamed of it.
He's racing back to New York. He just came in for a few hours to...
To fuck me.
Takes a few hours.
God.
-Give me your ring. -No.
-Give it to me! George! -No, you...
When you ask a girl to marry you, you have to give an engagement ring.
Julianne, I can't believe you're doing this to me.
I've come all this way to help you for this! You're insane.
Please, for one day, find me irresistible.
You got a deuce at the architecture foundation.
They'll be waiting in front of the fountain.
Stop it.
-Is something wrong? -Well...
I guess it's just the way that you always talked about George.
It always seemed...
Seemed like...
It sounded like George was...
-Gay? -Actually, yes.
Common misconception.
It is, because George likes to pretend that he's gay.
And why would you do that?
I find it attracts women.
Indeed, yes. Worked for me.
Big time.
Get off me.
Right.
Oh, my God, race you to the altar.
-Underplay. -Got it.
Hey! I'm Jules' fiancé, George.
Just in time for a quick pre-conjugal visit,
if you catch my drift.
I do.
You're going to humiliate me, aren't you?
Only if I can.
Just one thing. Stay away from...
What?
George! My God! My God!
I don't know why I'm so carried away.
It's so... It's so... Well, I don't...
-Against God's plan? -No!
Oh, no. It's just wonderful!
It's wonderful! Wonderful!
Mom! Mom!
Mom!
What? What?
You have to meet George.
-George. -You must be Kimmy's little sister.
Julianne's fiancé. They're gonna be married.
-No! -Yes!
-What's going on? -Julianne's getting married!
-Oh, my God! -Why didn't you tell us?
There hasn't really been time.
I wanted to. I wanted to shout it from the rooftops.
But Jules said, "No, pumpkin, no.
This is Kimmy's day.
Let's not take the attention away from Kimmy."
Julianne.
"Dear, sweet, adorable, chocolate-covered Kimmy."
-Those were her very words. -Really?
I think I'm gonna cry.
-Me, too. -George.
This is so sweet of you to come to our rehearsal.
I insist you stay on to lunch.
-No, no, no, no! Absolutely... -Love to.
Love the bag, love the shoes, love everything. Love to.
Thank you.
Darling, what about your flight?
Canceled.
BARRY THE CUDA'S
I can tell you this now, but I was very worried about you.
About me?
Yeah, I mean, all the stories that Michael told me were hilarious.
But, I mean, all those broken relationships, all those men.
It must have hurt going through so many guys
and never finding the right one.
Hurt? She couldn't sit down for seven years
until she met teensy-weensy little me.
And all the while,
the man of your dreams was right in front of you.
She's talking about me.
-George. -Yes, darling.
How did you and Julianne meet?
George is my editor.
Yes, but, poopy, we met a long time before that.
Actually, it's a very romantic story.
Would you like to tell it, sweet pea?
No. It's private.
Not anymore.
I first met Julianne
in a mental institution.
Julianne was there visiting some French chef
she'd sent insane with a bad review.
And I was there visiting Dionne Warwick.
Dionne Warwick?
Well, yes, he thought he was Dionne Warwick.
Who is Dionne Warwick?
Sacrilege, darling.
She's Whitney Houston's aunt.
She's very good on the Psychic Friends Network.
Isn't she?
Do you know the way to San Jose?
So, there I was with Dionne, whose real name, by the way, is Jerry.
We're having one hell of a singsong.
Then, suddenly, breezing through the doors
from the electric shock therapy room, I saw her.
A vision in pink.
Pink?
You don't wear pink.
She does, Michael. Sometimes, she does wear pink.
-George. -You do.
I do.
I said to Dionne, "Dionne, who is this vision?"
"Surely she must be the understudy to some fabulous Broadway star.
I mean, look at her skin."
-George, please. -"Who does her hair?"
And in that moment I knew...
We don't all need to know what you knew...
Yes, we do.
I'm very curious.
They do.
I knew
that someday, we would end up like this,
like some glittering Doris Day-Rock Hudson extravaganza.
I said to Dionne, "Dionne, I'm in love.
Could this siren love me?
Are the gods that kind?"
And Dionne turned to me,
opened her lovely eyes and said...
What'd she say?
The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup
I'll say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair now
While wondering what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you
Forever and ever you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you forever and ever
We never will part Oh, how I love you
Together forever, that's how it must be
To live without you would only mean
Heartbreak for me
-All right! -Go, Granddaddy!
I run for the bus, dear
While riding, I think of us, dear
-I say a little prayer for you -He says a little prayer for you
At work, I just take time
And all through my coffee break time
I say a little prayer for you
Forever and ever You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you forever and ever
We never will part Oh, how I love you
Together forever, that's how we must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me
My darling, believe me
Believe him
For me, there is no one but you
Please, love me, too
Answer his prayer
And I'm in love with you
Answer his prayer now, baby
Answer my prayer, baby
Answer his prayer
-Say you love me, too -Forever and ever
You'll stay in my heart And I will love you
Forever and ever
We never will part Oh, how I love you
Together forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me
All right now!
Well, heartbreak for you, actually.
All right, you've made your point.
Get on your plane and go,
and I will call you at the turn of the century when I've forgiven you.
Oh, Jules.
It would never have worked out, you know.
Yeah, because it was dishonest.
Different temperaments.
Look, tell him you love him.
Bite the bullet.
George.
What will he do?
He'll choose Kim.
You'll stand beside her at the wedding, kiss him good-bye, and go home.
That's what you came here to do.
So do it.
George isn't my fiancé, Michael.
It's been over for... For ages, but he can't accept it.
I'd built you up so much.
I couldn't let him lose face in front of you.
He could never stack up to the one man I measure everyone against.
I don't know. This is strange.
I gotta tell you, when you...
When you told me that you were marrying George, I...
I got this really strange...
You were jealous?
Crazy jealous.
I'm sorry.
Can we maybe spend some time alone this afternoon?
Would that be all right?
This is built in the Art Deco style from the 1920s.
You'll notice in the center of the building here,
you have a setback for light to come down to the city.
The building coming up here on the left, the first building is
home of the Quaker Oats company. You can see the Quaker smile.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple of days.
About us, I mean.
Have you?
Well, there are a lot of memories to choose from, I guess.
It's more than that.
I mean, it's...
It's kind of embarrassing to say it this way,
but you've sort of been, you know, the woman in my life.
You've been the man in mine.
And I was thinking this could be our last time alone together, you know?
Except for that hot affair we'll have twice a year.
Except for that.
I mean, you commit to this wedding,
and then...
And then it seems like this momentum, and...
And then you forget you chose it.
You and I didn't...
I mean, in our relationships with other people,
we didn't use the word "love" a lot, did we?
Kimmy says if you love someone,
you say it.
You say it right then, out loud.
Otherwise, the moment just...
-Passes you by. -Passes you by.
Yeah.
We don't even have a song.
Kimmy and I, we don't have a song.
You think that's a bad sign?
Someday
When I'm awfully low
And the world is cold
I will feel a glow
Just thinking of you
And the way you look
Tonight
Is your dance card filled?
Well, I'd have to check.
You know, I keep it on PowerBook these days.
Is that right?
With each word
Your tenderness grows
Tearing my fears apart
With each laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
WALLACE COMPANIES
One more detail.
Yeah, you have one?
Yeah, if you go with a 6% dividend.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Hi. -Hi.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
Well, I said I'd drop you at the stag. He's got a million things to do.
Sort of unofficial best man.
Yes, of course.
Well, Kim said
when Michael turned the job down that there was no friction.
Friction? No.
Good.
I haven't caused a problem, have I?
No, you haven't. Well, nobody has.
Listen, you're just a little bit early.
Actually, I needed to make some phone calls.
Would it be possible to use your office?
Of course. Right at the end of the hall on your left.
Thank you.
Take your time.
Okay.
E-mail.
email
New letter.
"To Eric Isaacson,
Senior Editor,
Sport magazine."
"From
Walter Wallace."
See, you can do this. It's easy. You just do it fast. Get it over with.
It's like it never happened.
"Eric,
I need a favor.
My daughter's
every happiness is in your hands.
I have offered Mike O'Neal,
my new son-in-law,
a great opportunity in my company.
To his own detriment,
Michael will not accept our offer
while he works for you."
"My daughter joins me in this plea for your cooperation.
With gratitude, Walter."
Do You Want To Send? Yes - No
Why would I send this?
He'd get fired.
No.
Save For Later - Delete
"Save for later."
It's not like I'm sending it.
I'm just saving it for a few hours.
Till we come back here and Michael can see it.
Perfectly harmless.
WALLACE COMPANIES
Yeah, they were all here.
What about Bill's reaction?
I don't know. I don't think he was happy with his 10% cut.
Send out this, this, not this, this.
-That's it. -Okay.
And by the way, I'm holding four or five e-mails
that I wrote over lunch. Send those out, too.
Yes, sir.
-Bye. -Bye.
All set?
I can't believe this! Did you try every key?
It's no big deal. She just gave us the wrong set of keys.
WALLACE COMPANIES
No. No, there's got to be a janitor or a...
Or a guard, or, you know, a cleaning woman,
or, you know, some kind of...
I mean, somebody has to be in this building! I need a brick.
I just need a brick.
What is the big deal about getting this file tonight?
I'm up against a deadline.
Me, too. I'm getting married tomorrow.
That's my point!
Everybody's gonna be so busy with more important things, and...
And so this is really my last chance.
If I could just get up there to Walter's office.
They're right by the computer.
Then I could just e-mail those figures right out, right now.
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Nobody's doing business.
Monday morning, crack of dawn,
-Walter'll walk you right up there. -No.
Give it up, kid.
You can't win 'em all.
The Drake
Good night.
Jules?
This thing mean that much to you?
Yes.
Come on. We'll use the phone in your room.
Walter's probably not even asleep. We'll call the house.
-I'll drive you up there. -Thank you.
I'll drive you up there, we'll get the right key
-and we'll go back down to the office. -Okay.
If I fall asleep on the altar tomorrow, you better be there to...
I'll be there.
These are all from Eric.
This fax is from Eric, too.
My wedding, you'd think my boss would leave me alone.
Maybe it's a congratulations.
What is it?
"Mike, I can't believe I'm doing this to you
on the night before your wedding,
but I think you need and deserve to know what you're marrying into."
"I received the following e-mail this afternoon.
'Eric, I need a favor. My daughter's every...'"
-Hello? -Isabelle, I need to talk to Kim.
Is there anything wrong?
No, I'm just tired. Please, put her on.
Thanks.
Jules?
Could you give me a minute?
Please.
Excuse me, miss? Are you locked out?
No, no, no. Just stepped out.
It's a no-smoking room.
Well, it's a nonsmoking floor, too.
Maybe you could go down to the lobby?
Why don't you have me arrested?
I mean it.
I am a dangerous, criminal person.
I do bad things to honest people.
You could make a citizen's arrest. I wouldn't struggle.
It'd be like getting Al Capone on tax evasion.
Can I help you, miss?
Do you smoke, "Richard"?
Yes, I do, but I'm...
-It's a nonsmoking floor. -Yeah.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
But you know what?
You know, my grandmother always said,
"This, too, shall pass."
Thanks, Richard.
I want you to quit this shit.
It'll kill you.
What happened?
It's over.
She denied it. She said I was crazy and paranoid.
A bad combination.
There's a big brunch tomorrow morning at her parents' house.
And she said, "How can I call it off? How can I...
"What am I supposed to tell everyone?"
-Oh, Michael. -No, it's for the best. It really is.
She was right.
I am crazy.
To fall for someone I hardly knew.
I'm so glad you're here.
Hey, you still got that ring?
I tried it on, and it won't come off.
Why don't we take a walk or have some food sent up or something?
I just want to be alone.
Is that okay?
Sure.
Maybe I'll...
Maybe I'll go back to New York for a while and hang with you.
-Eric'll understand. Or we could... -Yeah.
Go somewhere, if you want.
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento.
I've never been to Texas.
Yeah.
You what?
-Can I try that? -Sure.
-Excuse me. -Good luck.
So this is your basic call-off-the-wedding party?
I came here to confront everybody.
I'm not gonna just slink away like some coward.
Besides, she hasn't told anyone. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
Michael, there is a wedding at six o'clock.
Have you changed your mind?
Do you want to marry Kimmy?
I made a decision.
It's over.
I'll go tell 'em.
First...
Do you think she's all right?
Maybe you could go check on her for me.
These are the most beautiful flowers I've ever seen.
How is he?
Well, he's sort of wondering
why you haven't told your parents that the wedding's off.
Well, I don't know. I'm still...
I'm still hoping for a miracle, I suppose.
I mean, how could he think that my father and I would do such a thing?
I only minored in psych, you understand, but...
Maybe Michael couldn't commit to this marriage,
so he created a delusion,
produced an unconscious psychosomatic manifestation of...
I'm better with food.
Okay.
You are Michael.
You're in a fancy French restaurant.
You order
crème brûlée for dessert.
It's beautiful.
It's sweet.
It's irritatingly perfect.
Suddenly, Michael realizes he doesn't want crème brûlée.
He wants something else.
What does he want?
Jell-O.
Jell-O?
Why does he want Jell-O?
Because he's comfortable with Jell-O.
Jell-O makes him comfortable.
I realize, compared to crème brûlée, it's Jell-O,
but maybe that's what he needs.
-I could be Jell-O. -No.
Crème brûlée can never be Jell-O.
You could never be Jell-O.
I have to be Jell-O.
You're never gonna be Jell-O.
Now you need to come clean with your parents,
because if you're waiting for that
"do you take this man" part, it's considered poor form.
I love him.
And whatever delusions I drove Michael to, there's truth at the heart of it.
You see, I want him to work for my father.
I want to stay in school, and I want a life of my own.
Please, tell him that it's my fault and that I love him.
You're the only person that I trust.
-I'll be right back. -Thank you.
-Elliot. I love you. -I love you, too.
-How is she? -What about me, guys?
Hey, knock it off!
Yes, sir.
-I asked you, does she... -She admits that it's her fault.
Totally, completely, inexcusably her fault.
Do you think she still loves me?
Love... Well, it's a strong word.
And I don't know that I'm necessarily qualified as a...
I guess I wouldn't be totally off base if I said that, in her way,
-she does possess strong feelings... -Jules.
Sure she does, Michael.
She's crazy about you.
You fill up my senses
Like a night in the forest
Like the mountains in springtime
Like a walk in the rain
Tell her I'll marry her at six o'clock,
if she'll still have me.
Like a storm in the desert
Please.
Like a sleepy blue ocean
I'll be right... Right back.
You fill up my senses
Come love me again
What did he say?
He said,
"Marry me."
Thank God you were here.
Yeah.
I got so confused.
It happens.
Got a minute?
What's up?
I'll have to say this quick,
or I'm just gonna have this massive coronary,
and then you'll never hear it, and you have to.
This is, by far, the dumbest thing I've ever done in my entire life.
So dumb, in fact, that I can't.
Oh, but I'm gonna.
What's wrong?
Michael,
I love you.
I've loved you for nine years.
I've just been too arrogant and scared to realize it,
and, well, now, I'm just scared, so...
I realize this comes at a very inopportune time,
but I really have this gigantic favor to ask of you.
Choose me.
Marry me.
Let me make you happy.
That sounds like three favors, doesn't it?
But...
Kim!
Michael!
What are they doing?
They're just lovely together.
Aren't they?
Kim!
Michael!
That's our maid of honor.
She's from New York.
Kim!
-Michael! -Kim!
Kim!
Michael! Michael, wait!
Michael, wait! Please! You'll never catch her!
Doesn't anybody leave their car unlocked?
Nobody trusts anybody anymore!
A Good Samaritan!
Hey, come back here!
"Shy tendrils of russet pleasure
began their unbidden journey.
She moaned.
The tonnage of years of anguish, sacrifice..."
-Yes? -It is not going well!
This is what comes of telling the truth!
Or even part of it!
You know, getting what you deserve isn't fair!
Where are you?
I have stolen a bread van, and I'm chasing Michael down Michigan Avenue.
George, this is all your fault!
I told him the truth! I said that I loved him.
And I kissed him, and this is what's happened!
Jules, a question.
When you kissed Michael, did he kiss you back?
What do you mean? We were lip to lip!
I mean, was there anything on the other side of that kiss
that leads you to believe that this chase will end happily?
That's beside the point. We were interrupted.
-Who interrupted you? -Kimmy!
She ruined everything!
And Michael started chasing her before he could answer me.
-Michael's chasing Kimmy? -Yes!
-You're chasing Michael? -Yes!
Who's chasing you? Nobody. Get it?
-There's your answer. Kimmy. -No!
Yes! Jules, you are not the one!
Now, for God's sake, the wedding is at 6:00 p.m.
You have a small, but distinct,
window of opportunity to do the right thing.
George!
All aboard!
Michael!
I have a confession to make.
Another confession.
Besides that I love you, this is even worse.
The e-mail that Walter sent to your boss,
I wrote that.
I'm the bad guy.
Are you crazy?
Jules, are you... Are you completely insane?
I mean... I mean...
Jules, how could you do that?
Michael, it wasn't supposed to get sent.
I just...
I just wanted you to get mad at Kimmy.
God.
I have done nothing but underhanded, despicable,
not even terribly imaginative things since I got here.
But I was...
Michael, I was just trying to...
To win you...
To win you back.
But that doesn't excuse any of it.
I'm pond scum.
Well, lower, actually.
I'm like the fungus that feeds on pond scum.
Lower.
The pus that infects the mucous
that cruds up the fungus that feeds on the pond scum.
On the other hand...
Thank you
for loving me that much.
That way, it's pretty flattering.
Except it makes me fungus.
Well, that part, I knew.
God.
I'm glad you didn't get on that train.
Well, I came here looking for her.
Why would she be here?
This is where I proposed.
I had to cover a game in Milwaukee, and she saw me off.
And the train was starting to leave...
and I jumped up on the step, and I held the handle
and without
a thought in my head, I just shouted,
"Marry me!"
And the train was pulling out, and she just suddenly screamed, "Yes!"
Just once.
And blew me a kiss.
Well,
it would've been a nice wedding.
Michael, you can't believe that you've lost her.
I mean, sooner or later, you will find her,
and you'll look into her eyes, and you'll see all that love.
I just hope that it's sooner rather than later,
or else I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.
Okay, just wait. Wait.
We'll... We'll... We'll split up.
And you will go to every romantic place the two of you have,
and I will go, I don't know, someplace brilliant, and we'll find her.
We will find her.
Mandy!
Wallace egregious residence. Mandy speaking.
Hi, it's Jules. You guys haven't gotten a call from Kimmy, have you?
Oh, no. She slipped out, the little monkey.
-During the commotion. -Commotion?
Well, my sister was licking an ice sculpture,
and her tongue froze right to it.
And that's a commotion?
It's a sculpture of the David.
And so Kimmy would be...
She's probably with Michael doing the nasty.
Either that, or crying in her nachos down at Comiskey Park.
Excuse me?
I had this crank call from some guy who says he saw her in the luxury box.
-Right. Okay. -I said, "What would the bride be doing?"
Right, right. Listen, can you bring my dress to the church?
And I have to pick something up before the ceremony.
Okay. Don't forget to shave, now.
Here we go. Here's the hair dryer.
All right. There we go.
It's gonna be okay. No, no, no pictures. No pictures.
Please, no pictures.
Excuse me.
-Kimmy! -Kimmy!
-Kimmy! I know you're in here. -Kimmy!
The guard saw you come in!
Just leave me alone, you bitch!
Kimmy.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Catfight!
You came here pretending to be my friend, and I made you my maid of honor!
Who asked you to do that?
You knew me, what, eight minutes?
Michael trusted you, so I trusted you.
You wanted to keep me close. You didn't trust me for a second.
I was right.
Of course you were right, but that's not my fault.
You kissed him!
-At my parents' house! -That's cold.
-On my wedding day! -Bitch.
Tramp.
Shut up!
Now, I love this man, and there is no way that I'm gonna give him up
to some two-faced, big-haired food critic.
All right. Okay. All right! All right!
I kissed him.
I tried to steal him.
I lost.
He doesn't love me.
He loves you.
Kimmy, I haven't done much that I'm proud of the last three days.
I'd like to take you to the church
so you can walk down that aisle and marry the man of our dreams,
'cause he sure wants to marry you.
So raise our glasses, and wish Mike and Kim every happiness
for a long and happy life together
filled with happiness.
Well, I guess that's it.
To the bride and groom!
-Hear, hear! -Hear, hear!
Now let's hear from the maid of honor, the lovely Julianne.
I had the strangest dream.
I dreamt that some psychopath was trying to break the two of you up.
Luckily,
I woke up, and I see
that the world is just as it should be,
for my best friend
has won the best woman.
I didn't get you a gift.
However,
this is on loan
until you two find your song.
So...
Someday
When I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow
Just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
Oh, but you're lovely
With your smile so warm
With your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me
-But to love you -Ever want to love you
-Just the way you look -Oh, you look
Tonight
-It's mine! -I don't think so.
I got it!
-Good-bye! -Good-bye!
Bye.
Hello, George.
Hey, gorgeous. Having a good time?
Not particularly, but I did what I came to do.
What? You split them up?
No, I said good-bye.
Good girl. I'm proud of you.
I'd be prouder still if you were dancing.
I have big plans for dancing.
Just give me 30, 35 years.
The misery, the exquisite tragedy, the Susan Hayward of it all.
I can just picture you there sitting alone at your table in your lavender gown.
Did I tell you my gown was lavender?
Hair swept up. Haven't touched your cake.
Probably drumming your fingernails on the white linen tablecloth
the way you do when you're really feeling down.
Perhaps even looking at those nails, thinking,
"God, I should've stopped in
all my evil plotting to have that manicure.
But it's too late now."
George, I didn't tell you my dress was lavender.
Suddenly, a familiar song.
Then you're off your chair in one exquisite movement.
Wondering, searching, sniffing the wind like a dappled deer.
Has God heard your little prayer?
Will Cinderella dance again?
And then, suddenly,
the crowds part.
And there he is.
Sleek, stylish,
radiant with charisma.
Bizarrely, he's on the telephone.
But then, so are you.
And he comes towards you,
the moves of a jungle cat.
And although you quite correctly sense that he is gay,
like most devastatingly handsome single men of his age are...
You think, "What the hell.
Life goes on.
Maybe there won't be marriage. Maybe there won't be sex.
Why is there always a problem? It's a good question.
Do you want to go home? Do you want to turn around?
-Yes. -It's the Himalayas.
How long have I been talking about the Himalayas?
-How long? -Far too long.
Horst, when we get there, can you give me a hand, please?
-Yes, of course. -Ingrid, stop it.
Let's try to make the best of this.
Where's this idiot who's supposed to meet us?
Move! Move!
Mr. Harrer. I have your tickets.
-I'm late. Take me to my train. -No, you don't understand.
-What? -I am Peter Aufschnaiter.
I am leading the expedition. How do you do?
Here's our celebrity. Mr. Harrer?
May I say, Mr. Harrer, on behalf of the Reichssportsfuhrer,
we are honored to have such a great German hero on the team.
Thank you, but I'm Austrian.
Yes, but I'm sure that as a distinguished member
of the National Socialist Party,
you would be proud to plant our country's flag
on the summit of Nanga Parbat when you reach it.
Hans Lobenhoffer.
Lutz Chicken.
And a picture with your lovely wife.
And Mister...
Horst Immendorf. Family friend. No picture necessary.
When is the little one due, Mrs. Harrer?
About the time my husband reaches the base camp.
Thank you.
Why don't you tell the entire stinking country our troubles?
I'm getting on that train. Do you have anything you want to say?
Fine.
Go. Leave.
I'll see you in four months.
-Take good care of her, Horst. -I will, Heinrich.
Mr. Harrer?
We will travel 5,000 miles.
When we reach India, we will head for the Himalayas
and the ninth-highest peak on Earth, Nanga Parbat.
Germany calls it Unserberg, "Our Mountain."
Before us, four German expeditions attempted it.
All failed.
Eleven climbers were killed in storms and avalanches.
By now, the conquest of Nanga Parbat is a national obsession.
A matter of German pride.
July 29, 1939.
We have already made Camp Four at 22,000 feet.
Overhead is the Rakhiot Glacier and a difficult climb up the icefall.
The baby must be at least 1-month-old now.
I have been so confused and distracted.
I can't climb with my usual confidence.
Heinrich!
Are you all right?
Shit!
-Are you all right? -Shall we come down?
Lost a crampon.
Go ahead.
The weather's getting bad. We should rope up.
-Did you hurt yourself back there? -Just a scratch. I'll lead.
Rocks!
Look out below!
Hold me!
Heinrich!
Heinrich!
Have you got me?
Hold me.
You should have told me how bad that wound was.
I should take a look at it. I could sew it up.
It's not your problem.
Actually, it is my problem.
-It's my life. -What?
When you conceal a serious injury and put my life at risk,
I consider that my problem.
No, you put your life at risk. I saved it, so shut up.
Please, it is not your place...
Shut up!
The next time you lie about an injury, Heinrich,
you're off the team.
Try it.
August 4, Camp Five.
Some fierce storms have passed.
My team-mates are nervous about the avalanches
so we've been holed up for days.
Aufschnaiter should take advantage of this lowland weather to make high camp.
But he disagrees with me. Fool.
It seems the others don't mind sitting here waiting, hoping, doing nothing.
So much time to question one's self is not good.
I am beginning to think this whole expedition was a mistake.
Run! Avalanche! Get out!
Leave everything!
Put that down!
We are going down now!
If they're frightened of a storm, send them down to Camp Two.
I can summit on my own!
Peter, always give the best man his shot!
He's trying to tell us he's the best man.
Give me two Sherpas. I can make Camp Six by tonight
and my final attack tomorrow!
-We are going down now as a team. -I've earned that peak.
-I want that peak! -As a team. That's an order.
That is an order! An order!
Follow me.
Dalai Lama photo. Good protection.
Take it, sahib. It will protect you.
No, that means nothing to me.
Dalai Lama. Dalai Lama photo.
Sahib, take it. Good protection for you.
Good afternoon, Herr Harrer.
Well, let's hope that Germany retreats from Poland
as quickly as you did from your mountain.
It might save you some prison time.
What is this? Who are you?
I'm sorry, but you're under arrest.
What charge? Failure to summit? No, I'm afraid not.
You see, war has been declared between His Majesty's Government and Germany.
So all enemy aliens on British Empire soil are now prisoners of war.
-Stop, or I'll shoot! -Hands up!
Wait. No, you don't understand. I'm Austrian. I'm a climber.
I have nothing to do with your silly war.
I can walk myself. This is an insult.
You think you have the last word, but you don't.
Pigs! All of you, pigs!
October 15, 1939.
Reaching prison camp, I make a promise to myself.
I will be lying beside Ingrid before the summer solstice of the New Year.
The Himalayas are right in front of us.
It will be easy to escape and get lost in them.
My fourth escape attempt brings me no closer to my goal.
How far did you get this time?
All I have achieved is a certain dubious celebrity among the prisoners.
If only my hand could express what is in my heart.
I hear the guards are mailing letters for you.
-Yes. -Would you mail these?
Thank you.
Hey, Heinrich, have you read this book?
It was checked out to you.
-We need to talk to you. -What about?
About this.
Impressive. When do you plan to leave?
After monsoon season. And you?
I see you've chosen my route. Through Tibet.
You know, the few foreigners who have tried never came back. So, good luck.
-Would you like to come with us? -Why?
After all, you are the authority on jailbreak around here.
-We could benefit from your experience. -Please.
Stop this embarrassing charade.
Every time you escape, Heinrich, the patrols are doubled and tripled.
It is making life very difficult for the rest of us.
I prefer to travel on my own. Thanks for thinking of me.
The mailman has come.
Dear Heinrich.
Please sign the enclosed divorce papers and send them to my lawyer.
Horst and I intend to be married as soon as the divorce is finalized.
As for your letter, yes.
Your son, Rolf Harrer, was born while you were climbing the mountain.
He is now 2 years old and calls Horst, "Papa."
When he is old enough,
I will tell him his real father was lost in the Himalayas.
It seems the kindest thing to say,
considering you never wanted the child anyway.
Needless to say,
I have no intention of "resolving our differences" as you suggested.
They were resolved the moment you left Austria.
I'm sorry you have been imprisoned in India
and hope this dreadful war will soon be over, for everyone's sake.
Ingrid.
I'm coming with you.
This is your plan?
In my humble opinion, this is ridiculous.
Then since you are so humble, we won't ask your opinion.
Open the charts. Turn around.
Keep your back to the gate. Open the charts.
Keep talking. Wait for my signal.
We are clear. Okay.
Open the gates.
See to this. Open the gates.
I'm going off on my own.
So, good luck.
First escape from prison camp, November 18, 1939.
Rolf Harrer, three-and-a-half months old.
My 30th birthday, July 6, 1941.
Rolf Harrer, exactly one year, 11 months and 26 days.
Last escape from Dehra Dun. Rolf Harrer...
Take two and sleep it off. I'll send you a bill in the morning.
What are you doing here?
I missed you so much, Heinrich. I thought I'd pay you a visit.
What about the others?
The Italians were caught outside Nelang
and Lutz and Hans, they got sick and had to turn back.
-Sorry to hear that. -I'm sure you're heartbroken.
May I impose upon your generous nature and camp here tonight?
Be my guest.
Thank you. It is very gracious of you.
-Good. -What else do you have in there?
-Good. -What else do you have in there? A ten-piece orchestra?
By the way, I heard the Japanese have retreated all the way back to Shanghai
so even if you make it to the Chinese border,
you may have difficulty catching up with them.
I don't care if they're repelled all the way back to Tokyo.
You should if you want to get back to Austria.
-But I don't. -Don't what?
-Plan to go back. -Why not?
No particular reason.
But when you get there, tell my wife
that two years in prison camp is roughly equivalent to four years of marriage.
And I'm glad to be free of them both.
I'm not going back either, not until this shameful war is over.
-And where are you headed? -Tibet.
Then on to China, see if I can find some work there.
And you?
By my calculations, the Chinese border is 2,058 kilometers away.
Tibet is 68.
It's a long way to travel with such a heavy load.
No, just full of food.
-Precisely. -Mine.
That's too bad.
Those mountains are treacherous. There are glaciers to be crossed.
If you had roped up to me, I could've kept you alive.
Considering your performance the last time we roped up,
Considering your performance the last time we roped up, I think I'm safer without you.
Of course.
But I think you are wrong about that Tibetan border calculation.
By my measurements, it is 65 kilometers.
Care to wager a kilo of food on that?
All you've got is some stale crackers, Heinrich.
But I'm right. I'll win.
Devils! Go away.
Tibet, the roof of the world.
It feels as though we have ascended a medieval stone fortress,
towering above the center of Asia.
This is the highest country on Earth.
And the most isolated.
There it is. Tibet.
-Exactly 68 kilometers. -Congratulations.
Unfortunately, you've eaten all your winnings.
Yes.
Just smile and say yes. It's better that way.
It's amazing what you learn in prison, isn't it?
Tibet.
-No foreigners allowed in Tibet. -Oh, please.
No foreigner.
Oh, please.
Yes. Thank you. Of course.
No translation needed.
Some people are glad to see us.
Don't let it get to your head, Heinrich.
When the Tibetans clap hands, it means they are driving out evil forces.
We need to find food.
You talk to the Garpon, Governor of Province.
It is the prophecy. It says here in the final testament of great thirteenth Dalai Lama.
in the final testament of great thirteenth Dalai Lama.
"It may happen that, in Tibet, religions and government
"will be attacked by outside forces.
"Unless we can guard our own country,
"monks and their monasteries will be destroyed.
"The lands and property of government officials will be seized.
"The Dalai Lama and all the revered holders of the faith
"will disappear and become nameless."
Now you understand why we are not welcome to foreigners here?
Yes, but you must understand we're not here to threaten or harm.
We just need food, and then we'll be on our...
His Excellency, the Garpon.
Your Eminence, we're happy to see you.
We wanted to apologize.
Apologize.
And give you this very special gift.
You have nothing I want.
Please, from us.
Long live the Dalai Lama, His Holiness.
Thank you for the picture. Go back to India.
Two days into Tibet's western frontier and we are graciously kicked out.
Our guides have strict orders to escort us
to the Indian border some 40 kilometers away
and to shoot us if we attempt escape.
Must mean hello.
As long as they don't try to kiss me.
We have to stock up. I'm broke.
Don't look at me.
We have to eat, Peter. Know what time it is?
It is not negotiable.
My father gave it to me when I climbed Mont Blanc.
Everyone's climbed Mont Blanc, Peter.
If I had a watch like this, I would trade it.
-Where did you get this jacket? -North Tibet.
Communism soldier come from China. Very nice.
They give food, money. Very nice. Communism soldier.
Very nice, yeah.
You like military uniforms, yes?
I have German army boots. For you. Yes?
German army boots. Wait.
Give me these, for the guards.
Look!
Like this. You like?
Very good. They're tough.
My friend, shall I show you how German soldiers march?
You must make this face.
Come. Yes.
Stop!
Excellent. Yes. You, with practice.
Now, I will show you how German soldiers run.
Stand like this.
Guess what?
All clear.
Know what time it is?
You think I'm so happy to be traveling with you
I should foot the bill?
You are such a big man you don't need to contribute?
You have a problem, Peter?
Reminds me
what you said at the bazaar back there.
"If I had a watch like that,
"I would trade it."
You did not have one.
You cheap, lying bastard. You have three.
This is junk from some Italian prisoners.
I don't give a shit.
Haven't you ever heard of a principle?
What principle? What?
You want a watch? Go ahead. Pick one.
-And keep your principles. -Look at you.
Caught being a selfish brat and you're gloating.
You're acting like an old woman. What do you want?
Try apologizing.
Try feeling a little remorse.
And if all else fails, try wiping that smirk off your face.
Take your stinking watch and shut up.
I don't need another boring sermon from some frustrated glorified tour guide.
No wonder you are always alone.
No one can stand your miserable company.
Please, take them.
It was wrong of me to hide them.
-Keep this. -No.
I didn't deserve it, either.
Go ahead.
He'll be three-and-a-half years old now.
Pretty soon, she'll tell him I was lost in the Himalayas.
Which is fine.
Why?
Better a dead father than a lousy father.
Write him a letter.
Let him know you're still alive.
New York.
Venice.
-Paris. -Your Holiness, where are you?
It is time for your lesson.
Your Holiness, where are you?
It is time for your lesson.
Dear Rolf Harrer.
I'm a person you don't know, a man you've never met.
But you are someone who occupies my mind and my heart
in this distant land where I have gone.
If you can imagine a hidden place, tucked safely away from the world,
concealed by walls of high, snow-capped mountains,
a place rich with all the strange beauty of your night-time dreams,
then you know where I am.
In the country where I am traveling, Tibet,
people believe if they walk long distances to holy places,
it purifies the bad deeds they've committed.
They believe the more difficult the journey, the greater the depth of purification.
I've been walking from one faraway place to the next for many years.
As long as you have lived.
I have seen seasons change across the high plateaus.
I have seen wild kiangs migrate south in winter
and sweep back across the fields when spring appears.
In this place, where time stands still, it seems that everything is moving,
including me.
I can't say I know where I'm going, nor whether my bad deeds can be purified.
There are so many things I have done which I regret.
But when I come to a full stop, I hope you will understand
that the distance between us is not as great as it seems.
With deep affection, your father,
Heinrich Harrer.
Get up. Peter.
My God.
I'll give you these.
Yellow head!
-No! Wait! We have nothing! -Give me money!
-We have no money! -Give me watch!
-Give me clothes! -We have nothing for you! Nothing!
Wait!
Where are you headed?
Holy city... Lhasa...
I have permit.
Impossible, foreigners not allowed in Lhasa.
We have special permission for Lhasa.
Lhasa, I have permit.
It is unseemly for the spiritual leader of Tibet to spy on people.
Only a month ago, we were certain of death at the hands of bandits.
And today, we have reached the gates of the forbidden city of Lhasa.
It is as difficult a goal as Mecca
and precisely as attractive because it is closed to all foreigners.
Even in our miserable condition, we feel the lure of Tibet's holiest city.
Home of the Dalai Lama.
Only a few foreigners had penetrated its mysteries.
Oh, my God.
Is it over?
No, it is not over.
You are invited to stay for lunch, if you like.
We'd like that very much.
I am Tsarong. Welcome to my home.
I am Peter.
Lord Chamberlain, may I request an audience
with the Regent and ministers of the cabinet?
It's about two foreigners who came to Lhasa.
With respect, Rinpoche,
if your intention is to stop the Chinese from recruiting political allies,
if your intention is to stop the Chinese from recruiting political allies, then demanding that they stop trying to bribe monks
is not the most effective tactic.
I asked the opinion of the ministers,
not that of a mere secretary.
Of course.
Forgive me.
You may leave now. Start translating the letter as written.
Of course.
Do you realize how many men could survive such an ordeal?
We should respect them.
If we return them to India, they'll surely go back to prison.
But they have no purpose here, Kungo Tsarong. No place to live.
I have invited them to stay at my guest quarters.
Assuming you would grant them permission to remain in Lhasa, of course.
Invited them to stay at your place?
But why?
Must one have reason to help those in need?
Beast.
I think she said you stink.
You do not need to introduce yourselves.
I know who you are.
I am Pema Lhaki.
Ngawang Jigme wishes to make a gift to you, so please take off your clothes.
Come on, let's get started. I don't have all day.
Well, this is most kind of Ngawang Jigme.
Who is he to be so thoughtful?
Secretary to the ministers of the government.
He wished to make you a gift of new clothes.
Please select your preferred article of clothing.
-You're a seamstress? -I am a tailor, sir.
The only tailor in Lhasa who has been to Calcutta
and can reproduce these silly costumes.
Okay, so
-I pick? -Yes, choose whichever you like.
-And you can make any of these? -Yes.
-Very good. -Did you make this?
Yes.
-Beautiful. -Thank you.
-Do you like this? -Whichever you like.
I will have this handsome tweed jacket and this pair of sporting woolen trousers, please.
-Okay, good choice. -Thanks.
And you, sir?
Perhaps you could choose for me.
Thank you.
Please, sir, take off your chupa. I would like to measure.
Stand still, please.
This way, please.
-Please stand still. -Sorry.
-No moving, please. -I'm sorry.
That way, you will never fall. It's perfect.
Still, walking up mountains is a fool's pleasure, Heinrich.
Not so foolish, really.
Look at this.
Go ahead.
That's after I climbed the Eiger North Face.
That's Olympics. Gold medal. Not important.
Then this is another great difference between our civilization and yours.
You admire the man who pushes his way to the top
in any walk of life.
While we admire the man who abandons his ego.
The average Tibetan wouldn't think to thrust himself forward this way.
Gentlemen.
Mr. Aufschnaiter. Mr. Harrer.
I'm sorry. Have we met?
No, we have not. I am Ngawang Jigme.
Yes, of course. Forgive us.
Thank you for your generous gift.
It's wonderful. Thank you.
You are most welcome. Auf Wiedersehen. I am sure we will meet again.
Perhaps you could help us explain
why the ministers demand that the Chinese government cease making
generous financial contributions to Tibetan monasteries.
Do our gifts displease your government?
I cannot speak for the Regent nor the ministers, Excellence.
I am only a mere secretary.
Not for long, I presume.
Sit down.
A man of such obvious talent cannot be satisfied
with just translating letters.
Your diplomatic skill
would be richly rewarded here.
Serving my country faithfully is reward enough, Excellence.
I ask permission to take my leave.
-Hello, Heinrich. -Hello.
It looks like we're both in need of a good tailor today.
Yes, there's a...
Please, take a seat.
Do you like these? I'll buy them for you.
Thank you, but I don't eat much meat.
-Don't eat meat? -He says they are knives from West.
You put them on your feet to cut meat.
No.
-They are ice skates. -Yes.
You put them on your feet to skate.
To glide... Sort of, dance on ice.
-Yeah. -Why?
-Why not? -It's another fool's pleasure.
Let's get them. How...
No, for this?
Ten.
And for this?
Did you see?
Did you see that?
-Did you hurt yourself? -No, thank you. I'm okay.
Here we go. Up.
-You okay? -Did you bang your head?
No, I'm having fun.
-You must hold on. -Watch me!
-Do not look too much at the ground. -All right.
-Look only into my eyes. -Yes, all right.
-Okay? Into my eyes. -Yes.
Can I help you?
-Yes, please. -Here, take my hand.
Are you happy?
-Very happy. -Yeah?
I try to picture you, Rolf
and this is what I see:
A young boy who is strong and bright.
A boy filled with curiosity about life.
A boy who isn't afraid to learn from his mistakes.
Hello, married woman.
Hello, bachelor man.
-Heinrich. -Peter.
Congratulations.
Well, come in.
The Japanese army is facing a growing challenge
not from China's unified front
but from the powerful Chinese Communist Army.
Under the control of Mao Tse-tung...
The rumor is that the Communists have taken over
the whole of North and Central China.
Rumor? It's a fact, Peter.
Ngawang keeps me up to date on all China's war news.
So, how are things at Kungo Tsarong's?
Frankly, I wouldn't know. I moved out five months ago.
Really? It has been this long since we have seen you?
-Apparently, it has. -And have you been busy?
This is why I'm extremely busy
since I've been hired to survey the entire city of Lhasa.
Unfortunately, your place is too far out for me to include it on my map.
We like our privacy.
Yes, apparently so.
What about women? Have you met anyone you like?
Women.
Since I failed miserably with an Austrian wife
an exotic failure with a Tibetan wife seems misguided.
But to answer your question, no, I haven't.
You?
A friend's good fortune is a blessing, Heinrich.
I'm sorry you resent ours.
You must be very lonely and sad.
Heinrich!
The war is over.
Have the Communists won?
Your war, my friend. Germany has surrendered.
Where are you going?
Back home. Austria.
Letter.
We miss you.
I miss you, too.
"Dear Mr. Heinrich Harrer,
"You are not my father.
"Please stop writing me letters.
"Rolf Immendorf."
Honorable Harry Harrer?
-Yes? -A letter for you.
The Honorable Heinrich Harrer doesn't want any more letters.
It is from the Great Mother of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
Thank you for coming, Mr. Harrer.
Thank you for inviting me, Great Mother.
Do you know the rules of protocol concerning my son?
Not exactly... I know one bows and performs prostrations.
When you are in the presence of His Holiness you must always be standing
bent in obeisance, hands folded in supplication.
If seated, you must always be seated lower than he.
Never look him in the eye. Never speak before he does.
Always refer to him as "Your Holiness."
Never turn your back to him. And never, never touch him.
He is the reincarnation of Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion.
After his recognition, he was renamed
Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshi Tenzin Gyatso
Holy Lord, Gentle Glory, Eloquent, Compassionate
Learned Defender of the Faith, Ocean of Wisdom.
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, would like to meet you, Mr. Harrer.
As his advisors have not permitted a private audience with you
His Holiness has asked me
to bring you along to my monthly audience.
I'd be honored and moved.
Hello.
Yellow head.
You have hair on your arms, too? And legs?
-How about you? -Mr. Harrer.
It's an honor to meet you, Your Holiness.
Do you like movies?
I haven't seen a movie in about eight years, but as I recall, yes, very much.
So do I.
I'm glad to hear that.
I have a movie projector. And films.
I want to build a movie house. Here, at the Potala.
With seats and everything.
-Seats would be advisable. -Can you build it?
-Excuse me? -Can you build a movie house for me?
My advisors cannot disapprove, and you will be well-paid.
And you'll have to come here every day to build it, every single day.
When you are here, you'll visit me.
We can have conversations on many topics.
I would like to learn about the world you come from.
For example, where is Paris, France? And what's a Molotov cocktail?
-And who is Jack the Ripper? -Kundun.
You can tell me many things.
I'm proud to be of service, Your Holiness.
What is the problem?
-What is the problem here? -Worms.
Please, no more hurting worms. Please.
Worms?
In a past life, this innocent worm could have been your mother.
Please, no more hurting.
It's impossible. Please, no more.
But you see,
Tibetans believe all living creatures were their mothers in a past life.
So we must show them respect and repay their kindness.
And never, never harm anything that lives.
You can't ask a devout people to disregard a precious teaching.
Yes, but Your Holiness,
with due respect, we can't possibly...
I'm sorry, but we can't possibly rescue all the worms,
not if you want the theater finished in this lifetime.
You have a clever mind. Think of a solution.
And in the meantime, you can explain to me what is an "elevator."
Antarctica. That's down below.
-Here. -Yes.
Fantastic.
England.
Don't look at me for help.
Here?
Shift.
I know him. Honk.
Hello!
Turn!
Brake!
Heinrich.
Peter.
The robe of a minister is so much finer than your old brown robe, isn't it?
Please.
Everyone, please.
You must be very clever to get such a good promotion.
I did not intend to be a secretary forever.
Apparently so.
Well, congratulations.
Evil omen!
From his headquarters in Peking,
the Chairman, Mao Tse-tung, was triumphantly proclaimed leader
of the new People's Republic of China.
Chairman Mao vowed that the first task of the Communist regime
is to reunite the Chinese motherland.
He declared that the remote kingdom of Tibet
is an integral part of the Chinese territory
and must join the great new republic.
"And must join the great new republic."
People's Republic of China is advised
the government of Tibet recognizes no foreign sovereign.
We are an independent nation.
All the Chinese officials will be expelled from the borders of Tibet.
We wish you a happy return to your homeland.
Have a safe and pleasant journey back to China.
May you have a safe and pleasant journey back to China.
We wish you a happy return to your homeland.
-May you have happiness and prosperity. -Ngawang Jigme.
Let me see.
You have a very long lifeline.
Unlike others here.
When we are facing the light, it's day, yes?
When we are in shadow, it's night.
So if the sun is just rising in Lhasa
that means it is just setting
in New York City, perhaps.
That's why it can't be the same time in every place.
-Does that answer your question? -Yes.
Tell me more.
What else do you want to know?
In a few moments, you will be entering the world of mass media.
I can hear news from all over the planet?
I don't know if they have live broadcasts from the Tonga Islands
but generally speaking, yeah.
Do you listen to news from your country?
From Austria?
No, not really. Give me some light, Kundun.
Why? It's your home.
Not any more, it isn't.
But don't you have friends and family there?
A few friends, no family.
Keep the light steady, Your Holiness.
Why? Is everyone dead?
Do you know there's another sentence construction aside from the question?
I was married, but I'm divorced.
What did you do?
I didn't want a child, so I ran away to climb a mountain.
You have a child, Heinrich?
Although I've never seen him.
All right.
Let me show you how this thing works.
-Give it all you've got. -Yes, Mr. Harrer.
Happy Christmas.
Thank you.
Happy Christmas.
Thank you.
What is this special occasion?
This is Christmas. And this is for you, my friend.
Go on.
"I found it in a shop in the Barkhor.
"It has traveled a long way and finally come back home.
"Thank you for your friendship. Heinrich."
It is incredible.
Thank you for saving my life.
...must be liberated from religious oppressors.
Tibetans must be reunited
-with their brothers and sisters -Turn that off.
-of the great family of new China. -I'm very sorry.
Foreigners control Tibet's corrupt government.
Our Tibetan comrades must be liberated from foreign imperialists.
Tibet's million serfs must be freed.
How many foreigners are there in Tibet?
You, Heinrich...
Tibet will be liberated.
He asked for you, Mr. Harrer.
Kundun?
They were destroying the village I was born in, Takster in Amdo.
It was terrible.
It was just a dream. You had a bad dream. That's all.
But it was so real. Where did it come from?
My mind could never imagine such terrible things.
I can't sleep. I'm afraid the dream will come back.
A couple of insomniacs.
Tell me a story, Heinrich.
Tell me a story about climbing mountains.
That's one way to fall asleep.
Those stories bore even me.
Then tell me what you love about it.
What...
The absolute simplicity. That's what I love.
When you're climbing, your mind is clear
freed of all confusions. You have focus.
And suddenly the light becomes sharper,
And suddenly the light becomes sharper, sounds are richer
and you are filled with
the deep, powerful presence of life.
I've only felt that way one other time.
When?
In your presence, Kundun.
The Chinese have already secured much of the northern border regions.
They have ransacked a village, destroyed the monasteries,
burnt scriptures and defaced holy relics.
We've been told they've even killed some monks...
-Which village? -Takster in Amdo.
It's where His Holiness was born.
Go ahead.
When you were defense minister to the previous Dalai Lama
then you wanted to reorganize the army.
Can you do it now?
The People's Liberation Army is one million troops strong.
We have 8,000 men with 50 pieces of artillery and a few hundred mortars and machine guns.
The task is hopeless.
Then you refuse the appointment, do you?
No. I accept it with honor.
You two gentlemen know about wars. What type of weapon do you recommend?
It seems the Chinese troops are advancing toward our northern borders.
Where's His Holiness?
The glory of a British coronation.
Nowhere in the world is there anything half so wonderful.
Only once or twice in the life of each one of us comes such a day as this
when we know that we are watching history in the making,
when we know that generations to come will look back on this day.
For May 12, 1937, will be one of the dates in history
that the schoolchildren will learn about, maybe a thousand years from now.
Every moment the thrill of excitement...
Do you think someday people will look at Tibet on the movie screen
and wonder what happened to us?
The coronation coach moves forward.
I don't know.
Don't you have all the answers, Heinrich?
No.
I don't.
On the same field where Tibetans traditionally gathered for picnics
ground was cleared to build an airstrip
so that the plane carrying three Chinese generals could land.
Nearby, the Tibetan army practiced its maneuvers.
Some of the soldiers wear ancient mesh armor.
They bring old muskets and spears as artillery.
The spectacle of a peace-loving nation, vainly attempting to create a military.
The fears of war on my friends' faces
Stand at ease!
...strike a deeply-buried personal chord.
Echoes of the aggressions of my own country,
the will to overpower weaker peoples
bring shame to me.
I shudder to recall how once, long ago, I embraced the same beliefs,
how at one time I was, in fact,
how at one time I was, in fact, no different from these intolerant Chinese.
The Tibetans say an enemy is the greatest teacher
because only an enemy can help develop patience and compassion.
They believe with rock-like faith that the power of their religion
will protect them against these Chinese.
In preparation for the generals' visit,
sacred ceremonies are performed throughout Lhasa.
Sculptures of deities have been carved with great care in butter.
As the sun melts them, they become a reminder that nothing lasts.
The rising star of the cabinet, Minister Ngawang Jigme
made an offering of his own to greet the Chinese generals and lead them through Lhasa.
Raising their flag is an honor the Chinese don't deserve.
When you are not strong enough to fight, you should embrace your enemy.
With both arms around you, he cannot point a gun at you.
Nothing in politics is a matter of honor, my friend.
History repeats itself, even in paradise.
General, we shall have our audience with His...
General, the monks have been making this mandala of sand for many days.
It is a symbol of enlightenment and peace.
General!
We do not sit lower than he does.
But, General, it is our custom.
I can sit down there.
Your Holiness, this is General Chang Jing Wu,
General Than Gua Ha, General Than Gua San.
They wish to have an audience with you.
May you have happiness and prosperity.
They are promising regional autonomy and religious freedom
if Tibet accepts that China be its political master.
Until I attain my majority, the Regent is the political leader of Tibet.
You should have requested an audience with him
to discuss these important matters of the world.
My experience of such things is limited.
I am a simple Buddhist monk.
All I know is the scripture and the words of Lord Buddha.
He said, "All beings tremble before danger and death.
"Life is dear to all.
"When a man considers this, he does not kill or cause to kill."
You must understand.
These words are ingrained in the heart of every Tibetan.
It is why we are a peaceful people who reject violence on principle.
I pray you will see this is our greatest strength,
not our weakness.
I thank you for your visit.
An offering to the enlightened ones.
Religion is poison.
The Chinese have attacked the Tibetan frontier near Dengo.
No!
"Today at the dawn, 84,000 troops of the 1st and 2nd Field Armies
"under the overall command of General Chang Jing Wu
"attacked the Tibetan frontier near Dengo.
"The Tibetan army believes an attack on Chamdo is imminent.
"Ngawang Jigme, our newly appointed governor
"is preparing to send troops toward the Chinese column
"in order to stop their progression."
As you know, Ngawang Jigme, Chamdo is the gateway to Tibet.
If Chamdo falls, the whole of Tibet will fall.
If I did not know that, I would not have been appointed governor.
You do realize, our troops are committed to fighting the Chinese to the last man?
They would rather die than surrender.
Rest assured, there will be no surrender as long as I am in Chamdo.
Radio Lhasa.
Now.
We request permission to surrender.
-But there will be no surrender... -I said, "Radio Lhasa."
Permission to surrender now.
We lost the war in 11 days, Heinrich.
This surrender is our death sentence.
And I'm afraid our friend Ngawang Jigme has issued it.
He abandoned Chamdo and then destroyed the ammunition dumps.
Without weapons and ammunition
there was no hope for the troops who wanted to fight.
Our guerrillas could have held the mountain passes for months,
even years.
It would have bought us time to make appeals for help to other nations.
Now it's lost.
They broke down the gates.
Hello, my friend.
We did what was the best for our country,
for Tibet.
On the way to Lhasa, I would see Tibetans wearing these jackets.
"Chinese soldiers. Very nice. "Give food, clothes, money. Very nice."
It's strange to me that something so harmless as a jacket
could symbolize such a great lie.
After all these years, you still do not understand Tibetan ways.
To return a gift is unforgivable.
A man who betrays his culture should not preach about its customs.
There was a time I would have wished you dead
but your shame will be your torture.
And your torture will be your life.
I wish it to be long.
We pray that His Holiness, the Dalai Lama
will be granted the power to unify his people.
We humbly ask the Tibetan government to honor our request
and let the Dalai Lama attain his political majority.
You have the entire palace in a panic.
I'm hiding from the world for a day.
Kind of difficult in a glass house, no?
It's the Moonlight by Debussy.
What else?
What else do you know about this song?
Kundun.
Him, him, and him.
I hope you've received your invitation to the enthronement ceremony.
Yes. Thank you.
-It's next week. -Thank you.
Do I look like an egghead?
No, they suit you.
We have a saying in Tibet,
"If the problem can be solved, there is no use worrying about it.
"If it can't be solved, worrying will do no good."
So stop worrying, Heinrich.
You have to leave.
You have to leave Tibet, Kundun. Your life's at great risk.
Forgive my presumption, but I made arrangements to get you out. Safely.
We should leave directly after the enthronement. The Chinese would never expect it...
How can I help people if I run away from them?
What kind of leader would I be?
I have to stay here, Heinrich.
Serving others is my path to liberation.
-Then I don't go either. -Why not?
Because you are my path to liberation.
The Buddha said, "Salvation does not come from the sight of me.
"It demands strenuous effort and practice."
So work hard and seek your own salvation diligently.
I am not your son
and I never thought of you as my father.
You were much too informal with me for that.
Do you ever think about him?
And what do you think about?
It's not the conscious thought, really, Kundun.
It's just always there.
When I crossed Tibet, he was with me.
When I came to Lhasa, he was with me. When I sit beside you,
he's there with me.
I can't even imagine how I pictured the world without him in it.
Then you should go home and be his father.
I know.
You have finished your job with me.
But you have to stay for my enthronement.
I want you to see me in all my pomp and glory.
It'd be a pleasure, my friend.
From the government of Tibet,
to Your Holiness, the fourteenth Dalai Lama,
we ask you to rule your people,
as the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet.
By your prayers and wishes, I humbly accept.
Butter tea. It was never my cup of tea.
-One was enough. -Yes, we must follow the custom.
A fresh cup of tea is poured for the loved one departing.
It sits untouched, waiting for his return.
May all travelers find happiness wherever they go.
Without any effort, may they accomplish whatever they set out to do.
And having safely returned to the shore,
may they be joyfully reunited with their relatives.
Mr. Harrer
from His Holiness.
Hello.
-Hello, Horst. -Hello, Heinrich.
Rolf, come out and meet him.
No, I don't want to.
May I?
Rolf, take your time.
Hey! What are you doing cutting holes in my wagon?
Sorry, Señor Lopez. We were just waiting for Zorro.
-Go home, muchachos. -Do you think he's going to come?
Someone thinks he will.
Joaquin, Alejandro, once I carved coffins for your mother and father.
I would hate to carve ones for you. Now, go!
Alejandro, Joaquin, this is no place for you. Get back to the mission.
Don Montero, for the love of God, why are you still here?
Now, now, Don Luiz. Calm, calm.
Santa Anna's men are three miles from the town. You have to go now.
The government of Spain would like to thank you for your devoted service.
This land is the property of the Spanish government.
In two hours it will be the property of the Mexican government...
...unless I hand them over to you.
I am well acquainted with Santa Anna. He will realize that the dons...
I am well acquainted with Santa Anna. He will realize that the dons... ...will be dutiful taxpayers and he will respect your claims.
...will be dutiful taxpayers and he will respect your claims.
The rest of Alta California I have divided equally... ...among the other dons. Make sure that all of them receive their grants.
...among the other dons. Make sure that all of them receive their grants.
Get the children out of the plaza immediately.
The children should never have to see the things we do.
I want to see! Put me down.
Zorro?
I saw him. I saw Zorro. Come on.
Who are these men that you would risk your life to have killed?
Who are they? No idea.
Three peasants pulled at random from the crowd.
Where is he?
Go.
Come on.
My thanks to you, gentlemen.
Now, if you will excuse me, I'm missing my own party.
Kill him!
You would murder three innocent men to capture me?
I would murder 100 innocent men if it meant killing you.
Three men, three cuts. A small memento of Mexico, Rafael.
To remind you not to return.
Tornado, my old friend, you are getting too old for this.
Yes, me too.
Is she warm enough?
I always put on an extra blanket for you, Señor.
But the good prince was not afraid of the evil king.
He raced across the drawbridge, fighting off 100 guards.
And then, looking very handsome and dashing in the late-afternoon sun...
...he leapt onto the balcony and thrust his enchanted sword...
...under the king's chin.
"You would kill three innocent men just to capture me?"
"Yes."
Then suddenly lightning flashed and thunder shocked the wasted land.
The evil king glared at the good prince and said....
Something very forgettable.
And the good prince, what did he do?
Well, he leapt from the balcony onto his faithful old steed, Tornado...
Well, he leapt from the balcony onto his faithful old steed, Tornado... ...and raced home to his beautiful wife, Esperanza...
...and to his little child, Elena.
Never to do anything so foolish or dangerous again.
She loves to hear your stories.
It's only the sound of my voice.
One day she will have no time for them.
I never tire of them. Why should she?
Esperanza.
She already has your strength.
Today she broke the little clay horse you made for her.
Diego.
It's just a scratch.
Diego, you promised me.
No more nights waiting up praying you come home alive.
The Spaniards are going home. Today is Zorro's last ride.
From now on we will grow old together with our five children.
-Five? -Yeah. Not enough?
I love you.
Doña de la Vega, still as beautiful as ever.
Don Rafael, what an honor. The governor in my home.
-You'll stay for dinner, of course. -I have come to apologize, Esperanza.
I'm sorry that I could not protect this country from the peasants.
I'm sorry that I couldn't make you love me.
And I'm sorry that I have to leave you without a husband.
Arrest him.
Blood never lies, Zorro.
You are a traitor to your country and your class. Take him away.
Wait.
-No! -No!
I would never have let any harm come to her.
She was never yours to protect.
Elena.
I want you to live with the knowledge...
...that you have lost everything that you hold dear.
I want you to suffer as I have suffered...
...knowing that your child should have been mine.
Elena! Elena!
Let me hold her.
Let me hold her!
Rafael!
She has her mother's eyes.
Rafael! You'll never be rid of me!
Stayed on their track Bringing them back
So pay the bounty now to me 'Cause....
'Cause...?
-Nobody's tough as Jack -Nobody's tough as Jack
-Nobody's tough as Jack -Nobody's tough as Jack
Now you're getting there. Like I done told you...
...singing can lighten your terrible load.
Hey, hey, hey!
Come one, come all, for the fright of your life.
See the notorious Murrieta brothers. Robbers, horse thieves...
...bandits, people of the worst sort. Hey! Get out here.
Garcia. The Murrieta brothers.
Get over here.
These men are now in the custody of Corporal Armando Garcia.
We will take them the rest of the way.
-Claim your bounty in Tlaxco. -When bulls start wearing bloomers.
How much are we worth?
All figured, about 200 pesos.
Two hundred pesos? That's it? A lousy 200 pesos apiece?
-We are wasting time. -That's 200 for the both of you.
What? Are you crazy? Don't take it, Jack.
Touch my brother again, and I'll kill you.
Yes, he will.
Hey, I thought you were tied up.
That's because you're stupid.
Drop it. Drop it.
Hey.
-They got a strongbox on the wagon. -We know. That's why we came.
It is a fact that I, the legendary Three-Fingered Jack...
...ain't even mentioned. I ain't even mentioned.
Ain't I the one that figured to kidnap the mayor from his own outhouse?
I tell you, I am the holy guts of this gang.
Without me, the whole dang opera falls apart.
Go. Go.
Come on. Get up, get up.
Go.
Go.
I want you to know I consider this an honor.
Bury the body. Bag the head.
Of course I have feelings for you.
Yes, yes, but quick. Hide in the barn.
He's coming.
What do you want? Please don't touch me.
What do you want? Who are you?
Don Rafael!
Listen to me.
If any of you is, or ever was...
...that masked man all dressed in black known as Zorro...
...reveal himself now.
I'm Zorro!
-They took my mask, my sword-- -Silence, you old fool!
I am Zorro! I am the man you want. I am the original--
Liar! Anyone can see you are too tall.
Get him out of here before he starts to stink.
Did you find him?
He's dead.
Back to the boat. I need some sleep before landing tomorrow.
The governor has returned!
Luiz.
Welcome home, Rafael. It has been too long.
Too long, my friend.
You said once you favored me above all.
Consider this a fool's apology for ever doubting you.
Come. A crowd has gathered to greet you.
-Don Pedro. -Don Rafael, welcome.
-You're looking well. -Thank you.
-Don Hector. -Welcome back, sir.
Don Julio.
Gentlemen.
Please, please.
I know you are not really happy to see me...
...so let us all stop pretending, shall we?
You think I don't know that you have been paid...
...even threatened, to come out in the hot sun and greet me?
I understand exactly how you feel.
Why should you care about any of your leaders, past or present?
What did they ever do for you?
The Spaniards oppressed you, the Mexicans ignored you.
And the dons? Well, the dons, the dons.
The dons seem merely content to cheat and lie to you.
In fact, I put it to you. Who, in your entire history, has ever helped you?
Zorro! Zorro fought for the people.
Yes, Zorro.
Where is he now, Padre, your masked friend?
Unless I am mistaken, he hasn't shown himself in 20 years.
Twenty years!
People of California...
...the time has come to take our destiny into our own hands.
Not as Spaniards, not as Mexicans, but as Californians.
I stand here before you today with no mask.
Only a pledge, a solemn pledge that I will never abandon you.
And you have my word, the word of Rafael Montero...
...that I will do everything within my power to help you fight...
...for a free and independent California!
Father.
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce my daughter, Elena.
Thank you.
Can anyone tell me what this flower is? I know this scent.
It's called romneya.
But it only grows in California...
...and I believe this is your first visit to our shores.
Yes.
Hey, hey, hey. More whiskey.
Or whatever you call this. I don't want to see the bottom of this glass.
Money first.
Money first.
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait!
-What about this? -Silver!
Of course, silver. The finest.
-Where did you get that? -It's none of your business.
Where did you get it?
It was my brother's.
He is dead.
-I'm sorry. -You're sorry?
Why should you be sorry?
You should not trade it for a mere glass of whiskey.
Why not? You think I could get two?
Who is that?
-The man who killed my brother. -You're drunk and angry...
-The man who killed my brother. -You're drunk and angry... ...in no condition to fight a professional soldier.
Get out of my way, old man.
Would you care to try again?
You're welcome.
-For what? -For saving your life.
-I would have killed him. -No, not today. He is trained to kill.
You seem trained to drink.
You would have fought very bravely and died very quickly.
Who then would avenge your brother?
I would have found a way.
-I have never lost a fight. -Except to a crippled old man just now.
-What is your name? -Alejandro.
Alejandro.
You know, there is a very old saying:
"When the pupil is ready, the master will appear."
If you want to kill this man I can teach you how.
How to move, how to think, how to take your revenge with honor.
And live to celebrate it. It will take dedication and time.
Why are you so eager to help me?
Because once, a long time ago...
...you did the same for me.
I can't believe it.
I never thought that, one day, I would be standing in the lair of the fox.
In the lair of Zorro.
This place was devoted to the training of Zorro.
Where were you all these years? I thought you were dead.
I was dead. And we will leave it at that.
I remember the last time I saw you. You were fighting a hundred men.
-A hundred men? -I do not forget.
You were the greatest swordsman who ever lived. Yes.
Rafael Montero was the governor of California then.
Do you remember him?
What?
Rafael Montero. Do you remember him?
Yes. His soldiers killed many.
And he was the sworn enemy of Zorro. You.
-Montero has come back. -Good. Then you can kill him.
No, there are too many complications for me to ignore.
What complications?
I can see we are not gonna spend much time talking.
Montero has some design for California...
...otherwise he would not have retained the services of Captain Love.
-We must find out what that is. -And then what?
If you are ready, we will both tempt our fates.
Let's go, then.
Do you know how to use that thing?
Yes. The pointy end goes into the other man.
This is going to take a lot of work.
This is called a training circle. The master's wheel.
This circle will be your world, your whole life.
Till I tell you otherwise, there is nothing outside of it.
-Captain Love-- -There is nothing outside of it.
Captain Love does not exist until I say he exists.
As your skill improves you will progress to a smaller circle.
Each new circle brings you that much closer to your adversary.
That much closer to retribution.
-I like that part. -Shall we?
Slow. Attack slow. Attack.
Slow. Again. Slow.
First triangle. Slowly. Good.
-Good. That is good. -Thank you.
Attack.
Good.
Time for a drink.
Perfect. Do it again.
One, five, three!
Six, four, two!
And lunge.
Over-lunge!
Lesson number one: Never attack in anger.
Lesson number two:
Come with me.
What?
-So, what is lesson number three? -To get to lesson number four.
Again?
-Black Andalusian. Magnificent. -It looks like your old horse, Tornado.
Quiet, quiet.
Damned horse. What are you doing, huh? What are you doing?
I'll see you tonight.
Zorro, you look better than ever.
Be careful, señorita, there are dangerous men about.
Well, if you see any, be sure to point them out.
Listen. I'm going to give you the great honor...
Listen. I'm going to give you the great honor... ...of being my horse.
We are like one spirit.
Damn it! Stop!
Go, go, go!
Get him!
Kill him.
Zorro! The legend has returned!
Don't yell.
I need sanctuary, Father. You don't know me--
Zorro! Of course I know you.
Zorro, is it really you? The years have been kinder to you than to me.
I have no time to talk now. Father, please, hide me.
Come.
It's just like the old days.
Padre, is that you?
Is everything all right? It sounds like there is a battle going on.
Don't worry, my dear. You are safe in the house of the Lord.
Of course, Padre. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
It has been three days since my last confession.
How many sins could you have committed in three days?
Come back when you have more time, please.
-Excuse me? -Listen, señorita....
Please, go on.
-I broke the Fourth Commandment. -You killed somebody?
-That's not the Fourth Commandment. -Of course not.
In what way did you break the most sacred of Commandments?
I dishonored my father.
That is not so bad. Maybe your father deserved it.
-What did you say? -I said, tell me more, my child.
Well, I try to behave properly, the way my father would like me to.
-But I'm afraid my heart is too wild. -Too wild?
-Yes. -Could you be more specific?
I had impure thoughts about a man.
I did. I think he was a bandit or something. He wore a black mask.
-He had a deep voice? -Yes.
-Ruggedly handsome? -His face was half-covered.
But something in his eyes captured me.
Captured you.
I felt warm and feverish.
Lustful?
Yes, lustful.
Forgive me.
I forgive you.
Look over there, by the altar.
Search everything. The chapel, the loft, the rectory, all of it.
This is a house of God.
Don't worry, Padre, we'll be gone by the time he gets back.
Señorita, you have done nothing wrong.
The only sin would be to deny what your heart truly feels.
Now, go.
Elena.
-What are you doing here? -I was confessing.
-Confessing? -Yes.
To whom? The priest is here.
Stand back, Elena. Please.
Out of respect for Miss Montero, I'll deal with you later.
Horse! Come here.
Blackie! Thunder! Storm!
Stupido! Get over here now!
I warn you. I'll get another horse.
So?
What do you think?
Sir, I got the black stallion, I carved a "Z" in the--
The people will be speaking the name of Zorro again.
You think stealing a horse makes you worthy enough to wear that mask?
Be careful.
You're a thief, Alejandro. A pitiful clown.
Zorro was a servant of the people, not a seeker of fame like you.
A buffoon.
-Zorro did what was needed. -Now he is needed again.
I didn't ask for your help in the cantina...
...but I came here to learn how to fight like you.
To have your strength, your courage.
Now when I try to use them, you slap me down?
Let me tell you something. I am tired of all your training, your lecturing.
I am tired of waiting for you to tell me I am ready.
I have my own scores to settle, a new life to find.
I thought I could do it here, but I was wrong.
Alejandro!
En garde!
Choose your weapon.
Montero has invited every don in California to a banquet.
If you want to be of service, you can join them as a spy.
I think I do not understand, sir.
You have passion, Alejandro, and your skill is growing.
But I must give you something which is beyond your reach.
-Yes? What is that? -Charm.
And what is that?
Convince Montero that you are a gentleman of stature...
...and he will let you into his circle.
Me?
A gentleman?
This is gonna take a lot of work.
Yes.
Look at me. I look like a butterfly.
This is the most stupid thing I've ever done.
-I doubt that. -We'll never get away with this.
Yes, we will.
A nobleman is a man who says one thing and thinks another.
What if Montero realizes who you are?
Montero thinks of himself as a true nobleman.
He will never look a servant in the eye. Listen to me.
Listen to me!
Most important thing of all...
...do not let the dons leave the table without you.
Yes, sir.
-Good luck tonight. -Thank you.
Stand up straight. Charm.
Charm.
Don Rafael Montero? Good evening.
I am Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia.
The formal Spanish greeting. I have not seen that in years.
-My father was very strict. -Who is your father?
Don Bartolo del Castillo.
I have heard of him, but never had the pleasure of meeting him.
I arrived last week from Spain by way of Paris, Lisbon and San Francisco.
I am inspecting my family's holdings.
Queen Isabella of Spain has been very generous to us.
Very impressive. What brings you here?
I heard you were back in California and knew I must introduce myself.
Her Royal Highness speaks very highly of you.
Really?
I thought I fell out of favor with the court when California was lost.
Only in certain circles.
Her Majesty knows those unfortunate events were clearly no fault of yours.
She told me this is still a land of opportunity for a man of vision.
-And you are a man of vision? -I am a man in search of a vision.
But my timing is unfortunate. I have interrupted a party.
Perhaps I could call again?
No, it would honor me for you to join us.
No, it would honor me to do so, sir.
Please allow me to introduce my daughter, Elena.
Charmed.
I'm afraid I have brought no gift for the hostess...
...but wait a moment.
-Thank you. -A pleasure.
Bernardo, pick up your feet. Señorita. Caballero.
Don Alejandro.
My father and I would like you to join us at our table.
I would be delighted, señorita.
Don Alejandro, I'm so pleased you could join us.
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia.
Recently returned from Spain.
This is Captain Harrison Love. Not a don, but a kindred spirit.
Are you not the man who was chasing a legendary bandit recently?
-He was hardly legendary. -So you caught him?
-It's only a matter of time. -The bandit may have escaped...
...but the rest of us will think twice before going to confession.
Thank you.
With all due respect, Don Hector, I disagree.
Until these people are free to govern themselves...
...I think we will see many more Z's carved into walls.
Don Alejandro, what do you think?
I think sheep will always need a shepherd.
But certainly not this Zorro creature.
He probably wears the mask to hide his bald head and unsightly features.
-Some would call him heroic. -Heroism, a romantic illusion.
-Much like nobility. -Elena, that is enough.
I would think heroism is something to aspire to, not sneer at.
All that playing swords, shooting guns, racing around on horses...
...gives me a frightful headache.
Such sweaty pursuits are hardly the work of a gentleman.
And what is? Climbing in and out of carriages?
No, my dear.
But increasing one's holdings so as to provide lavish comfort for ladies.
Such as yourself.
A woman's grasp of politics. What can I say?
We're at a party, aren't we? May I have the honor of this dance?
I would be glad to.
Yes? Were you looking for something?
A sense of the miraculous in everyday life.
Oh, really? Look someplace else. The lady and I were trying to dance.
You were trying. She was succeeding.
Forgive me, captain. A shameless joke at your expense.
I hope it will not be the last. Don Rafael wants you back. Now.
Should we try something more robust, or do you feel unequal to the task?
No, on the contrary.
I think only of your distaste for perspiration.
Maestro.
Well, that is the way they are dancing in Madrid these days.
Excuse me, Don Rafael, I need to catch my breath.
Your daughter is a very spirited dancer.
"Spirited." Thank you for putting it so delicately.
I apologize if you're offended.
No, no, no. Completely unnecessary, I assure you.
She is young and impulsive, but her beauty is beyond compare.
And she has her father's commanding presence.
Don Rafael.
As an advisor to Her Royal Highness in matters of finance...
...it would be my pleasure to introduce you both at court.
Join us in the courtyard. There is something I want to share with you.
What is that?
A vision.
Fellow dons of California...
...all of us can recall the golden years when we ruled this country.
We commanded respect and amassed a great deal of wealth.
But there was something that we never achieved.
We never determined our own destiny.
Well, the time has come to claim what always should have been ours.
My friends...
...I give you the independent Republic of California.
Don Rafael, every man here owes you something.
The land you gave us made us all wealthy men.
However, we must question your motives.
The day you arrived, you made us look like fools.
That is absurd, Don Pedro. I was merely playing to the crowd.
And what are you doing now if not playing to the crowd?
You're inciting us to raise arms against Santa Anna.
You know perfectly well we could never defeat his army.
I was not suggesting that we fight him for California.
I was suggesting that we buy it from him.
Santa Anna is waging an expensive war with the United States...
...and is increasingly short of money.
Even if we all combined our fortunes...
...we could not come up with enough to buy this country from Santa Anna.
I have already brokered a deal with him.
You are living in a dream.
And why don't we all live in the same dream together?
Meet me here tomorrow morning for a journey...
...that will open your eyes and lay all your doubts to rest.
My friends, I give you El Dorado!
Technically, of course, all this gold belongs to Santa Anna...
...but, fortunately for us, he's completely unaware of its existence.
For the deception to work, these bars have been marked...
...with the Spanish seal so he'll think they're from Spain.
You see now, gentlemen? Is it becoming clearer to you?
Two days from now we will buy this country from Santa Anna.
We will buy it with gold dug from his own land.
-Where did you find all these people? -Anywhere we wanted.
Brilliant.
Brilliant.
It's only part of the mining process.
First we picked it up off the ground, now we're down to blasting.
So this is the future of California?
This is my vision, yes.
Up here. Well, now, ain't you a sight for sore eyes!
Full-grown vultures walking around like real folk.
Welcome. Welcome to hell's outhouse.
They call us the disappeared ones, but we ain't exactly disappeared.
-We're just hard to find. -Wait! You. I know you.
You bet you do, peckerwood.
I'm the legendary Three-Fingered Jack.
And you are a bunch of murdering trash...
...dressed up in fancy, sweet-smelling doodads.
Ignore him, gentlemen. He's a common thief.
As common as they come.
But I ain't nothing compared to you gentlemen.
I steal gold, I steal money.
But you steal people's lives.
So damn you! And damn the horse that brung you.
Peckerwood?
Is there something amusing, captain?
Strange, I'd say.
It's the second time I've shot this man while he was flying through the air.
Don Alejandro! I need to speak with you at the hacienda, alone.
-Some other time, perhaps. -Today. Alone.
Good afternoon, Bernardo.
Good afternoon, señorita.
Your voice is so calming.
He's high-spirited. He needs to hear something soothing.
Yes, I understand.
How long have you served Don Alejandro?
Sometimes it seems interminable. Sorry, I speak out of place.
Do not worry, Bernardo. He will not hear it from me.
Don Alejandro confuses me.
Sometimes he seems so arrogant, so superior.
And yet the way he looks at me and the way he dances with me....
As if he were two completely different men.
Yeah.
You look so much like your mother.
How would you know that?
Well, I don't see much of Don Rafael in you.
I know my father wishes I acted more like her.
She was very proper, my mother. Always appropriate
Is that how he describes her?
-Yes. But I do not believe him. -She was more like you.
Perhaps. It would be a way of knowing her.
My niñera told me that the departed can see you in the moonlight.
When I was young I sneaked out at night and rode across Andalusia.
I would wave at the skies so she would know it was me.
-How did she die? -Giving birth to me.
My father rarely speaks of her. I think he finds it too painful.
Yes.
I know what it is like to lose a loved one.
You?
Yeah. A daughter. Long ago.
When I see you, I remember what it felt like to be a father.
-Your mother would be proud of you. -Thank you.
Bernardo, I have to ask you, have we ever met before?
No, why would you think that?
I do not know. It's strange, your voice seems so familiar.
I haven't been to Spain since before you were born.
Of course.
Well, it's a very pleasant voice.
Thank you.
-Good day, Bernardo. -Good day...
...Elena.
Did you know that the Compa Indians of central Peru...
Did you know that the Compa Indians of central Peru... ...used to cannibalize their enemies in order to absorb their power?
The eyes in particular were most sought after.
To be able to see through the eyes of an enemy is a valuable thing.
Where are my manners? Would you care for something to drink?
No?
A different vintage perhaps?
You're a very sick person, Captain Love.
Heads in water jars, hands in wine pitchers...
Heads in water jars, hands in wine pitchers... ...must strike you as odd, I suppose.
Well, for one thing, I think you ought to fire your housekeeper.
-Who is he? -An enemy.
He has a brother out there who will share the same fate.
I wish you luck.
-To your health. -Murrieta's brother or not...
...you are more than you pretend to be.
Maybe someday I will see what I look like through your eyes...
...Captain Love.
Oh, it is beautiful.
Excuse me. How much does it cost?
It is a gift, she says, in honor of your mother.
My mother?
-She loved your mother. -She must be mistaken.
-She loved your mother. -She must be mistaken. My mother died long ago in Spain.
She says there is no mistaking...
...the daughter of Esperanza and Diego de la Vega.
She says she was your nanny. She hung flowers on your crib.
I'm sorry, I cannot accept it.
Alejandro.
Listen to me. Can you find your way back to the mine?
No.
The carriage windows were all covered.
-He didn't even trust his own dons. -Nor would I.
You must go to Montero's house tonight.
Break into the chest in his study.
-Find out what his plans are. -People in the mine are dying.
And all I can think of is Captain Love.
He will come into your circle soon enough.
-I miss my brother, sir. -Your brother is dead.
We lose the ones we love. Put it aside.
How?
How can I do what is needed...
...when all I feel is hate?
You hide it.
With this.
Santa Anna has agreed to the transfer at noon the day after tomorrow.
He insists we deliver the gold five miles north of town.
Captain Love?
It's a safe distance from the mine. The bars are stamped and ready.
I don't foresee a problem.
Tell him we agree. You have done well, Luiz. Very well.
To the independent Republic of California.
Don Rafael!
You sent men to the hills? Doubled the guard at the wall?
Yes, yes, of course.
-After all, it's only one man. -It isn't just one man. It's Zorro.
And he knows about the mine. Otherwise he wouldn't be here tonight.
-How could he possibly--? -It doesn't matter how.
You don't seem to grasp the situation.
If Santa Anna finds out about this he will have us butchered.
Do you understand?
Then we should destroy the evidence.
Set explosives. Bury the mine.
-And the workers? -We destroy all the evidence.
No witnesses.
Make sure those papers are locked up.
Guards!
-The much-debated Zorro. -No. The legendary Zorro.
Put down your weapons! Tell them.
Do as he says.
Allow me.
Come. Stop.
Face the window.
Now, bend down and touch your toes.
Bend over!
Excuse me, Captain Love. Thank you.
Kill him!
Good morning, señor.
-Good morning, señorita. -Give it back.
-Good morning, señorita. -Give it back. -What? -Whatever it is you have stolen...
-What? -Whatever it is you have stolen... ...from my father, I want it back. Give it to me.
...from my father, I want it back. Give it to me.
No.
Come on, now.
I don't have the time to give you the proper instruction.
I have had the proper instruction since I was 4.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
This will make it more difficult. Señorita....
Don't move.
-Do you surrender? -Never.
But I may scream.
I understand.
Sometimes I have that effect.
Excuse me.
Goodbye, señorita.
What are you doing? What happened?
Zorro. Zorro was here. I fought him and he left. He left.
-Did you recognize him? -No, but he was young and vigorous.
-He was very vigorous, Father. -Vigorous?
Yes.
Let's go!
Go!
Come on!
Here. This is the canyon. That is where the mine is.
They have 25, 30 guards at most.
-Nothing that Zorro can't overcome. -I'm not going with you.
What?
I'm not going with you.
There's something I must do. It's a personal matter.
-What about the prisoners? -There's nothing more I can do.
-You mean, nothing you will do. -I gave my life to them.
In return, I lose everything. My wife was murdered before my eyes...
...and my child was stolen to be raised by my mortal enemy.
Montero?
Elena.
She's your daughter.
Yeah, she was.
So...
...you will simply take your revenge.
No, I will take my daughter. And don't pretend she means nothing to you.
She does. But you taught me to see beyond personal feelings.
-Was that all a lie? -You're too young to understand.
To understand what? Betrayal?
All the work, all the training, all the wise words, for what?
To smile in the face of my brother's killer while you make your own plans?
Alejandro, I taught you everything you need to survive.
Now I must look to my own heart.
Elena is all I have left. I am not going to lose her again.
What about California? What about the people?
They still have Zorro.
I have every inch of the countryside covered. If he shows himself....
-Are you all right? -Do you have the map?
-We'll find it. -Is your army ready to fight?
-No, sir. -Then of course I'm not all right.
I'm beginning to wonder if you want this operation to succeed at all.
-What are you saying? -What I'm saying, captain...
...is that I think my horse could run this army better than you.
I said I'll find him.
That means I will.
Perhaps I can save you the trouble. Go on, reach for it, captain.
-Who are you? -I warned you long ago, Rafael.
-You would never be rid of me. -De la Vega.
Rafael.
You were not the Zorro I saw last night.
-That was your master, Don Alejandro. -Yes.
But there are many who would proudly wear the mask of Zorro.
Either way, events have been set in motion that you cannot stop.
I'm not here to stop you.
Call for Elena.
Call her.
Captain, bring my daughter to me.
Bring her to me!
You cannot imagine, Rafael, how I have dreamed of this moment.
Night and day, 20 long years.
Really? I haven't given you a second thought.
-If I die, the truth dies with me. -We shall see.
-If I die, the truth dies with me. -We shall see. Father!
-Bernardo, what are you doing? -Tell her, Rafael.
-Tell me what? What is going on? -Tell her who her real father is.
Father, what is he saying?
This unfortunate man lost a daughter once...
...and now he seeks to claim you for his own.
Tell her how her mother died.
Your daughter is lost, de la Vega. You cannot have mine.
De la Vega?
A woman in town, she told me....
Diego de la Vega?
Father?
His name is of no consequence.
I was told my niñera used to hang something on my crib.
Yes, she had her hang fresh flowers.
No!
No!
Let us finish it, Rafael. Let us finish what we started...
...the night Esperanza died.
Drop your sword or I will have no choice but to have you shot.

...she knows.
Water!
Lock them up!
The fuses are burning. Hurry it up.
Let's go!
Wait here!
Secure the wagon, stay alert.
-De la Vega. -Rafael.
Only one question.
Really? What is that?
How would you like your remains displayed?
-Now I'm free to kill you. -No!
Drop the sword. Drop it.
You really think I would have killed my own child?
Did you miss me?
Elena! Get them out!
-"M" for Murrieta. -Two men. One dead.
You're doing well. Your brother would have shot himself by now.
Alejandro.
Is it finished?
Yes, Don Diego. It's finished.
Not for Zorro.
There will be other days, other battles to fight.
It is your curse and destiny.
My beautiful Elena.
The world is a strange place.
Too have found you at last only to lose you again.
You will never lose me...
...Father.
Elena.
You are like your mother.
Same eyes.
Same mouth.
Same spirit.
Alejandro...
...Elena.
And so it was. Lightning split the sky.
Thunder shook the air.
And then all was quiet.
The great warrior known as Zorro was gone.
The people of the land gave him a hero's funeral.
The largest anyone had ever seen.
They came from far and wide to say farewell...
...to the brave and noble champion.
But don't worry, little Joaquin.
Whenever great deeds are remembered...
...your grandfather will live on.
For there must always be a Zorro.
And someday, when he is needed, we will see him again.
On his fearsome steed, Tornado, riding like the wind.
His sword blazing in the sun.
Leaping, jumping! Swinging through the air!
Fighting like a lion, fighting like a tiger!
Fighting...
...as safely as possible.
Is this your idea of putting the baby to sleep?
Sleep tight, my son.
When I sleep, I will dream of this dashing rogue, Zorro.
But what face shall I give him?
He has been many different men...
He has been many different men... ...but he has loved you as all of them.
How can I refuse such a man?
Do you know where I might find him?

They didn't say. [ Man ] We heard about that place--
heard they was all killed.
- That's why they didn't say. - Smokers?
Maybe Smokers, maybe Slavers.
So what's the word? We tradin' or not?
We'll tally it like, uh, pure hydro.
Works out to... 62 chits.
I want twice that.
I just want one sip of hydro. No, not till you tell me.
She got inkings on her back. I seen her.
They say if you read the marks on the child,
they'll lead ya all the way to Dryland.
Dryland's a myth. Some still believe.
They say the Smokers even got an eye out for her.
Well, then, we better keep it to ourselves.
- Help you? - Yeah.
Where's the store? You found it.
You don't have much.
You the man with the dirt?
Skoal.
- One more. - Make it two.
A man this rich will buy for a fellow outwater, I'm sure.
One.
That's an interesting pair of boots you got.
Trade? No.
Shame.
Enola. Hey, what are you doing?
No, you can't have it. I need another piece. I want to draw some more.
I'll get it to you. Just stay in the back.
With all those chits, you could order up a bath. Have you ever had a freshwater bath?
Have you ever had a freshwater bath? Why are you talkin' to me? Just being friendly.
Why are you talkin' to me? Just being friendly.
- Is that a tomato plant? - Yeah.
You have a keen eye.
Saw one in a picture. How much?
Half your chits.
I'll take them too. Take what?
You bought everything. I'll take them shelves.
So, what did you see out there in your 15 months?
Such as? An end to all this water.
Askin' the wrong person.
The one they buried today? Uh-huh?
She found the only end there is.
I've got a proposition for you, Mariner.
I'm not staying. We're not asking you to. All we want is your seed.
We can look to our own for impregnation,
but too much of that sort of thing gets... undesirable.
When she's pregnant, you go on your way... with all the supplies you need.
You don't have anything. You're dying.
No man stays out that long and turns down a woman.
He's hiding something. Maybe he's a Smoker spy.
When the elders say so, you can leave... and not before.
Gills.
- Mutation! - He's a mutant!
[ Screaming ] My hand!
Throw the nets!
By what right--
You pay me to keep the peace.
This isn't it.
- He has killed one of ours. - He was defending himself.
- He needs to be destroyed! - Kill him.
That may be-- Let's kill him.
but not here and not like this.
[ Boy ] What is it?
It's tied. I can't get it off.
Open the gate.
Is it a map?
You'd tell me if you knew, wouldn't you, Enola? Mm-hmm.
- What are you drawing? - I don't know.
Helen, look. Look at the prodigal child's latest vision.
How soon before we can leave?
How soon before we can leave? [ Man ] Helen, I don't have any idea yet where we can go.
I haven't figured out the tattoo on her back.
I'm a stupid man. The answer's right there.
It's just beyond me.
Maybe he knows.
Oh, yes, I see. They are webbed.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten digits. That's wonderful.
They tell me too that you have gills.
Isotropic gills. Are they merely vestigial or are they functional now?
My name is Gregor. I've just come to pay you a little vi-- vi--
Oh, my God. [ Laughing ]
I'm sorry. I'm not laughing at you.
I'm excited. Your gills. They're functional.
Ichthyus sapien. You can breathe in the water.
How deep can you go?
Look, I'm only here because I want to learn more about you.
You don't like humans very much, do you?
I can't say that I blame you. But tell me--
I can't say that I blame you. But tell me-- Are all of your kind as bad-tempered as you are?
- I have no "kind." - Oh, fish rot.
I'd be surprised if there weren't others, and if there aren't,
I'd be surprised if there weren't others, and if there aren't, there will be eventually.
Anyway, I've come here because I need to ask you a question.
Where-- Where did your dirt come from?
Is it from Dryland?
Do you know what this is?
The ancients-- They did something terrible, didn't they?
To cause all this water. Hundreds-- Hundreds of years ago.
If I tell you, will you open this lock?
I haven't a key.
There's a mooring cleat down there. What?
Good as any key. A mooring cleat?
I won't hurt anyone. I'll just leave.
- I'll be right back. - [ Man ] Gregor!
What's your business there?
Move along! I'm not a brave man.
If you know anything about Dryland, please tell me. Please.
Don't let it die with you.
No, no, no, no. Stop!
[ Man ] Gregor! Move along!
[ Elder ] After considerable deliberation of the evidence at hand,
it is our decision that this mute-o... does, indeed, constitute a threat.
Therefore, in the interest of public safety,
he is hereby sentenced to be recycled... in the customary fashion.
Proceed.
I'm sorry.
Bones to berries.
Veins to vines.
His tendons to trees. His blood to brine.
Too strange for life, he was.
This mute-o now does leave us,
recycled and entombed,
in the presence of him who leads us.
Smokers! Dead out of the sun!
To your posts!
[ Woman ] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Kill! - There!
We are safe behind these walls.
Aren't we? [ Man Shouts ]
- [ Indistinct Shouting ] - Let me out! Let me out! I'll fight!
Give me the key to the city now.
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Floor it! Floor it! Floor it!
Swab it! Swab it!
Goddamn! More ammo!
[ Smoker ] Break down the door!
- My God! - [ Screaming ]
We'll have this atoll in no time.
Crank it! Crank it!
Look!
Look out!
Oh, no!
Keep that gas goin'! Fill 'em up!
- [ Gunfire ] - [ Gregor ] Helen, come quickly!
Helen!
You're not supposed to go yet!
Infernal machine!
Gregor. Gregor, wait!
Helen, I tried. There was an accident. I can't make it stop. Hurry!
You can make it if you try. Run! Up the stairs. Run! Quickly! - Wait! Wait! - I'll throw you a rope. Run quickly!
- Wait! Wait! - I'll throw you a rope. Run quickly!
Throw the rope now. Run, Enola. Slow down! Wait!
Throw the rope. No! No! Wait!
- [ Enola ] Gregor, don't leave us! - Oh, no!
I'm sorry! It was an accident!
Helen! Enola! Helen, I'm sorry!
Shoot him. Shoot him.
If I let you out of here, you're taking us with you.
Sure.
Enola, get down.
Here. Get over here. Get down.
Hurry! Come on!
Get the gate.
[ Man ] Run!
[ Mariner ] Hurry up!
Kamikazes. Come on!
That made a hole.
Find her! Get the girl!
There!
Go get that guy! Go! Kill him!
Wow. Enola!
- [ Mariner ] You're too slow! - Run to the other side.
- [ Gunfire ] - Come on!
[ Shrieks ] Grab on! Hold on, hold on.
[ Shrieks ] Grab on! Hold on, hold on. - [ Gunfire ] - [ Craft Shuddering ]
It's stuck! I can't make it through!
- Let her go! - [ Gunfire Continues ]
Just drop her!
Turn the wheel. The wheel! Turn it!
That! Come on. Push it.
I am! Hurry! Now pull!
Push it! Push it hard! Push it hard!
Okay, okay! Now pull this! Pull this!
Pull! Pull it! Hurry!
- [ Gunfire ] - Enola, jump.
Jump. Look at me. Jump! Okay. Now!
Well, excuse me! Did I say anybody could leave before the battle was over?
Did I? No! No!
Well, do somethin'. I hate sails.
Hey! Can you steer?
Can I trust you?
Answer me this, somebody. Why is that boat still firin'?
What's that cousin's name? Chuck.
- Hey, Chuck! - [ Smoker Leader ] He's pulling him right into us.
Maybe he doesn't answer to "Chuck." Call him "Charles." Charlie!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Charles!
Adios, cousins.
She's here somewhere. Keep lookin'.
[ Screaming ] Stop it! No! Let me down!
What you got? Couple of heartbeats over there. Aren't sayin' much.
If you'll notice the arterial nature of the blood comin' from the hole in my head,
you can assume that we're all havin' a real lousy day.
So here it is-- I need to know about that tattooed girl.
First one that tells me lives.
- I saw a girl. I saw, I saw-- - It was-- Sh-She had a big tattoo on her.
- I saw a girl. I saw, I saw-- - It was-- Sh-She had a big tattoo on her. She had lots of--
You won. Start over.
I saw a girl. I'm not sure,
but I think she got on a boat with three hulls.
The boat that cost me a thousand G's of go-juice? Yeah, the mute-o's boat.
- Mute-o? - Yeah. He got these slits here,
like-- [ Laughing ] like fish gills.
He wasn't really a man.
A fluke of evolution.
Oh, I'm sorry. A fluke of, uh--
- Evolution. - I know!
No! No, you said you wouldn't kill me! Did I say that? - Witnesses, anybody, did I? - Yes, yes, yes! You said--
- Witnesses, anybody, did I? - Yes, yes, yes! You said--
You said it. Oh, I may have.
I may have.
We get to the 'Deez,
tank up that sky boat-- send it out on patrol.
We gotta keep an eye out... for that ichthy-freak.
You been there, haven't you?
Dryland?
You know where it is.
Yeah, I know where it is.
And, uh-- And we're going?
You and I are.
The kid we gotta pitch over the side.
- What? - My boat's tore up.
I'm takin' on water.
I'd be lucky to get half a hydro ration out of that.
You know-- I said I won't drink.
For 12 days?
No. It's better one of you dies now... than both of you die slow.
Wait. Wait.
We saved your life. We got you out.
No, you got me out so you could get out. We're even.
She can cook. She can fish.
So can I. Then take my necklace. Take my necklace.
I got better ones below. No, look!
After what you went through back there on the atoll,
I can understand why you would want to.
But she's a child.
Is there something else then?
Enola! Go below.
Enola.
Yeah. You said so yourself.
Been out there a long time.
Couple hours ago, I was potential dirt to you.
We're not like that. You all are.
Know what I was really thinkin'?
Why I don't drop both of you in my wake right now.
You got nothin' I need.
You're taking us to Dryland.
Killing's a hard thing to do well.
- Believe me. I'm not the one to start on. - Both of us!
How long you plan to hold that on me? As long as it takes.
- Okay. - No!
Let me out! Let me out of here!
[ Indistinct Shouting ] Don't you touch my child!
Come here! [ Indistinct Shouting ]
Okay, now don't move, okay? There.
Oh. Oh, lookin' real good, yeah.
There. There.
All done.
Now, there may be some small problem in depth perception.
Well, it better not screw up my short game.
- Well? - [ Smokers ] Looks good. I like it. Yeah.
- I like it better than your real eye. - Much better.
What do you say, Toby? The truth. Looks like shit.
That's why I love children. No guile.
It does look like shit.
And it feels like cold shit.
Deacon? What--
I'm sorry. It-It's just that there's a problem in the pit.
Maybe you should come.
- Let's drive. - [ Chattering ]
The pit. Don't bother with the scenic route.
[ Deacon ] Drive!
Hey, it's drivin' better.
Get off!
Get over there. Get out of the way.
All right, all right, all right. Okay, okay.
You guys are great. Bless all you cousins over there.
Keep up the good work. Growth is progress. Growth is progress.
Somebody! Hey, up there!
Take it off!
- Yes. - Your Deaconship.
Hello. Good morning. Or night, whichever the case may be.
What is it? I'm a busy man. I thought you should know. We're down to exactly...
We're down to exactly... four feet, nine inches of black stuff.
Thank you, sir.
- How many G's is that after refinin'? - Maybe three refuelers. We'll burn through that in two lunars. Sweet Joe!
We'll burn through that in two lunars. Sweet Joe!
We'll burn through that in two lunars. Sweet Joe! Will somebody please tell me what's happened to this place?
We outgrowed it.
All right. The only thing that is important is the tattooed girl. We don't spare any go-juice findin' her.
We don't spare any go-juice findin' her.
We don't waste it anywhere else. You cancel all those tractor pulls...
We don't waste it anywhere else. You cancel all those tractor pulls... and all that stuff until later.
You got it?
Dryland is the mother lode. [ Laughing ] On your toes.
[ Laughing ] On your toes.
Excellent.
- Hi. - Move.
[ Helen ] Enola. Enola, come here.
Come on.
Enola, come over here.
Hey!
What are ya doin'? Decorating your boat. It's ugly.
Where did you get this? From down below.
This is mine. You don't touch anything of mine.
I drew it for you. You don't draw on anything. You understand?
What--
This is my boat. I got it the way I like it.
You take up space, and you slow me down.
You know, she's just a little girl.
She doesn't know your rules. You wanna stay?
You teach her.
Enola, what'd I tell you?
You're not so tough. You know that?
How many people have you killed?
Ten? Twenty?
You talk a lot. I talk a lot 'cause you don't talk at all.
Now how many?
- Including little girls? - I'm not afraid of you.
I told Helen you wouldn't be so ugly if you cut your hair.
In fact, you talk all the time.
It's like a storm when you're around. Enola.
Hey! What are you doing?
- [ Enola ] Helen! - [ Helen ] You bastard! She can't swim! Help me! Helen!
Help me! Helen!
Helen, help me!
Helen!
[ Sobbing ] Helen, help me!
Helen! Helen!
Hold on!
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.
Oh, please, come back. Please.
Please. Oh, please.
Hey! [ Gasping ]
Hold on. Okay, almost...
there.
Thanks. I swear, if you ever touch her again--
You son of a bitch. Look at me.
You will go to bed that night, and you will never wake up.
Shut up. What?
[ Helen ] Smokers? Yeah.
Can't we outrun them?
[ Engine Humming ] Not with my sail down.
- What are you thinkin' about? - That's a nice touch.
That's them.
Don't hit the kid.
Hey!
Coward!
Fuck!
No!
Cut it!
Come on! Come on!
[ Yells ] All right. Okay.
[ Helen ] Oh, I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry. But you didn't give me much choice.
Oh, I know. But you ran away. I-- What?
What are you do-- No! Please, no! No!
Don't ever touch anything on my boat again.
She said she was sorry!
That means you're supposed to say something back!
Did you say somethin'? [ Enola ] Mm-mmm.
[ Deacon ] The child-- Did he have the girl with him? - [ Pilot ] Uh-huh. - Seems to me if we launch now,
- [ Pilot ] Uh-huh. - Seems to me if we launch now, we can cut him down just about here.
If he doesn't change course. Ah, it's not likely.
He's a wily one, that ichthy-demon.
Yeah, if he knows he's been spotted,
he'll expect us to expect him to change course,
which is exactly why he'll keep his heading.
The important question is-- where's he heading?
And does he know how precious his cargo is?
I say that he's headed here, and we take him here.
Drifter? Mm-hmm.
[ Shouting Continues ] [ Helen ] Are we gonna stop?
Look at the flag! His flag's up.
I thought you all stopped for each other.
Well, maybe he has some food!
Don't find many who follow the rules anymore.
Well, make it quick. What's your business?
Trade.
You got any resin?
Resin? He's gotta be out of his mind. He's out of his mind. I don't have any resin.
Resin? He's gotta be out of his mind. He's out of his mind. I don't have any resin. [ Babbling ] You been outwater a long time, haven't you?
[ Babbling ] You been outwater a long time, haven't you?
Must be jokin' me, man. Resin! You don't got enough. How 'bout food?
How 'bout food?
Could you say that again, please?
- How 'bout food? - Ah, yeah, food.
Yeah, that'd be good, eh?
I haven't eaten in, well, you know, forever.
Which one of you two is a cook then?
'Cause I usually fall for the waitress. [ Chuckling ]
Like you said, I don't have much.
Now listen, eh? Let's see. What do I have to do?
We can start with that wee orchard you got over there.
- [ Whooping ] - All right. Hold it there.
[ Mariner ] We can talk. [ Drifter ] Fair enough.
It's a nice rod, isn't it?
I like that rod. It's a nice rod. [ Babbles ]
Got yourself a wee harem goin' here now, do ya?
What you want for the women? We're not for sale.
Not for sale? There's no such thing as not for sale.
Not for sale. Not for sale, eh?
Are they a pair or would you consider sellin' 'em separate? No.
Our business is done here unless you got some resin or sail you can part with.
I told you once already, I don't have it.
I-I-I don't have it. Don't have it. Don't have it.
Haven't seen neither for trade in lunars now. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
I do have somethin' that'll make you change your mind.
Somethin' that you can't pass on. [ Giggles ]
I took it off an Atoller refugee camp.
The life savings of the entire clan.
Paper. [ Babbles ]
It's paper. Have you ever seen paper? Look at it.
Smell it.
I been savin' it for a special trade.
Don't you do it.
You know, maybe I'm talkin' to the wrong person here.
Whose boat is this? Is it your boat or your boat?
No. No, it's his boat. But he doesn't own us.
Half an hour.
[ Mumbling, Babbling ] Out of his mind somethin' there.
I got two pages in here, man. I mean, I'd get half a dozen girls with this, you know.
Half an hour.
- You tradin' or not? - Don't.
- You tradin' or not? - Don't. Shut up.
Okay.
Forty-five minutes with the wee one right there.
I like to do the talkin', if you know what I mean.
No!
Fair. Come, come, come, come, come!
No. My boat.
- Fair enough. Fair enough. Good, good, good. Aye. - Helen.
- Sit down. - Enola, just do as he says.
It's been a while for me now.
Guess it's been more than a while, actually.
I've only got half an hour. Half an hour, half an hour, half an hour--
[ Mumbles ] Great, great, great--
[ Gasps ] Ooh. You're so beautiful. Aye. Anyone ever told you that?
Give me that. What are you doin'? It's just a game.
Oh, I, um-- I, uh-- We was just playin'.
The trade's off.
I changed my mind.
Well, um-- Well, you can't do that.
I mean, a deal's a deal, eh?
I just did.
Hey!
She's mine. Aye. No. No, no. I own her. But-- No.
- Go on. - Get, get, get. Go, go, go. Good, good.
But don't go too far now. This won't take but a minute.
I hate this boat. I hate this boat!
You bastard.
You-- You're pretty stingy for a man who's got everything, aren't ya now?
- [ Yells ] - [ Crashing ] [ Drifter ] Ah, you bastard!
Where's me boat?
Where's me boat?
Help me to me boat.
Ow! Me boat.
Me boat.
[ Helen ] What the-- No!
You'd never catch anything with this. It's useless.
Look, I'm sorry. You were right about the pole.
You were right, but we have to eat.
Now I know you can hear me!
Now we can fish for ourselves. You show us what to do.
You must know how. Even you've gotta eat.
You just sit there.
What-- [ Mumbling ] I don't know.
Happy now?
You don't like my singing, do you?
Helen says you don't like my singing 'cause you can't sing.
- Ever try and listen? - To what?
The sound of the world.
- I don't hear anything. - That's because you're too loud,
and you're movin' around all the time.
Try sittin' still.
Eyeball?
I wish I had feet like his.
Then maybe I could swim. Enola.
[ Burps ] Sorry.
Never met a person couldn't swim before.
I can't.
People said I was weird.
Maybe they were right.
Maybe they were right about you too.
Enola wanted to give you this.
And this.
She won't take it again.
You don't look much like her.
Well, I'm not her mother if that's what you're asking. You act like it.
What are those marks on her back?
Nothing. They're just fanciful things.
- Like what she draws? - She draws what she sees.
She's like a mirror.
People on the atoll thought she was a--
Freak?
Uh-huh. Yeah.
I just thought she was special.
I'm not givin' it to her. It's just--
A loan.
Yeah. I'm not givin' it to her.
Is Dryland beautiful?
You'll see.
Enola? [ Laughing ]
Enola, what are you doing?
Those monsters'll kill her! No, they're asleep now.
Hands around my neck.
Let the water tell your arms and legs how to move.
We're goin' down. Hold your breath.
What is it? What is it?
The barter outpost.
You said we'd get to Dryland today.
Today. Tomorrow. What's it matter?
I need resin.
- What is that? - It's PortuGreek. Their own language.
Or so I thought.
There's my girl. Yeah.
Howdy, darlin'. Come on in here now.
What's going on? Smokers.
What the hell?
He's spotted us. Sound it!
Sound it! Sound it! Sound it! Sound it!
[ Helen ] Enola!
Starboard side! Now.
Get in the chair.
Watch it. He's clearin' the net.
Go to the helm.
Get the centerboard! Centerboard?
What centerboard? I don't know what to do!
It's too late. Over here!
No!
Gimme that rifle. Boy, if you wanna do somethin' right,
Gimme that rifle. Boy, if you wanna do somethin' right, you've got to do it yourself.
[ Whispers ] All right.
I winged him. I say we load...
all the go-juice onto one boat and run the freak down.
You can't catch him in ten boats, and you wanna send just one?
Well, I pray that you're jokin'.
Bring me the trackers.
He's hurt.
It's not what you think. They weren't after her.
- I saw what I saw. - What?
No more lies.
- [ Shrieks ] - What are the marks on her back?
People say it's the way to Dryland.
Dryland's a myth!
No. You said so yourself that you know where it is.
You did.
You're a fool to believe in something you've never seen before.
I've seen it. I've touched it! Dirt that was richer and darker than yours.
It was in the basket we found Enola in!
It doesn't exist! Well, how can you be so sure?
Because I've sailed farther than most have dreamed, and I've never seen it.
But the things on your boat.
"Things on my boat" what?
There are things on your boat that nobody has ever seen!
What are these shells?
And that reflecting glass?
And th-the music box? That--
Well, if not from Dryland, then where? Wh-Where?
You wanna see Dryland?
You really wanna see it?
I'll take you to Dryland.
Get in.
Well, what about Enola? There's only air for one.
Get in the water. It'll be all right.
Don't touch anything.
Okay?
I didn't know.
All this time...
I didn't know.
Nobody does.
Can you get us outta here?
I'd say there are two chances o' that.
- Hey! - No way and no how.
Shoulda bought me that drink. Come on!
This way. Come on!
Proper introductions first.
I'm the Deacon.
If you don't recall the face, perhaps it's 'cause I didn't always look like this.
Now-- [ Clears Throat ] I suspect she's somewhere real close.
So we can tear this boat apart lookin' for her,
but I'd rather somebody just tell me where she is.
And the first one that does that lives.
And the runner-up-- Well, actually, there are no runners-up.
Oh, sweet Joe, I love this part.
Choose 'em. One, two. Live or die.
You know, personally,
I'd rather shoot the sperm-of-the-devil here.
Huh? But you know somethin'?
I don't think you're gonna tell me, are ya?
Huh? Too bad.
Come on, eh? What do you say?
She's not your kind.
You don't even have a kind.
If you say it, he'll still kill us both.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
If you don't tell me,
I swear to Poseidon I will torch your boat.
Refresh my memory. What happens when neither one of 'em talks?
Never happened before. Never happened before.
[ Sighs ] All right!
If they won't tell us where she is, do 'em! Both of 'em! Just kill 'em now! [ Fires Gun ]
- No! - [ Helen ] No!
So gullible! Bring her here.
- Take and ye shall receive! - [ Helen ] No! Leave her!
So ends your daily sermonette! [ Laughing ]
All we gotta do is figure out this map. Turn her upside down here, boys. Turn her up--
Turn her upside down here, boys. Turn her up-- Does that mean anything to you at all? No.
[ Deacon ] We'll figure it out back at the 'Deez. Back at the 'Deez, boys.
Back at the 'Deez, boys. Careful with her. Careful with her!
What about them? Do 'em both.
Torch the boat.
We have to go under!
No, I can't breathe like you!
I'll breathe for both of us.
[ Enola ] Helen!
Helen, help! Helen! Helen!
My boat.
Enola.
What is this? Get those chains off her.
What are we, barbarians here?
Goodness gracious. Sakes alive.
Come on. Outta here, you big, nasty animal, you!
Rub-a-dub-dub. [ Chuckles ]
You wanna come over here and sit on my lap?
No? [ Clears Throat ]
How 'bout a cigarette?
Nothin' like a good smoke if you miss your mom.
Never too young to start.
No. Well, I got somethin' right here I know you'd like.
Like to draw, don't you? Huh?
Now they're yours...
Now they're yours... if you help me with just one problem, all right?
Now-- [ Clears Throat ] Now that tattoo on your back-- [ Clears Throat ]
I've been told that, uh-- that's actually a map?
It's the way to Dryland. Now we're gettin' someplace.
Now we're gettin' someplace.
Could you teach me how to read that?
Setback.
Well, have you ever heard any of your friends talk about it?
You know, like your mommy or your pet fish? Did he say anything?
You shouldn't make fun of him. He wouldn't like it.
Girl, I don't give a shit what he'd like. He took out my eye.
And if I ever see him again, I'm gonna cut open his head, and I'm gonna eat his brains!
You think he'd like that?
You can't kill him. He's even meaner than you are.
But he's not here.
And he ain't comin'.
And no one's gonna save you.
He'll come for me. He will.
Then you better tell me what I wanna know,
or he can see what's left of you in a goddamn jar.
We're going to die here, aren't we?
Aren't we?
After the atoll,
when I offered myself to you,
why didn't you take me?
'Cause you didn't really want me.
Not really.
Have I been asleep long?
I was dreaming.
It's funny.
I always thought Dryland floated.
That it drifted with the wind. That's why it was so hard to find.
Why did you believe in it so much?
Because we weren't made for the sea.
Got hands... and feet.
We're supposed to walk.
I miss her sound.
Don't you?
[ Gregor ] Helen!
He-- No, no, no. Helen, up here. Above you!
- [ Chuckling ] - [ Helen ] Gregor!
Smart thinking to burn your boat.
Without the smoke, I never would have found you.
Who's that with you?
Ichthyus Sapien, is that really you?
I'll throw the rope down. You catch it. I'll help you climb up.
Helen. Where's Enola?
Smokers took her. They'd have me too if it weren't for him.
My friend, thank you. Very human of you.
Go grab your things quickly. Quickly. Come.
[ Gregor ] You see? Right down there.
There's several of us survivors. We'll just start over again.
[ Man ] You can't ask us to go get her.
[ Man ] You can't ask us to go get her. [ Woman ] Enola's the reason we're in all this trouble.
[ Woman ] Enola's the reason we're in all this trouble. [ Woman #2 ] Forget it. We're not going.
[ Woman #2 ] Forget it. We're not going. [ Helen ] They don't have any reason to kill her. They need to find Dryland just like we do.
- Of course. - [ Helen ] If the mariner's willing to go, why not us?
[ Woman ] If he wants to go, then let him!
[ Woman #2 ] We don't want you here! You or the girl!
Helen. The papers the mariner brought you--
It's the same language the tattoo is written in. They're numbers.
[ Man ] Gregor, you're as crazy as she is! [ Woman ] We can't stay here!
We're wasting valuable time. More Smokers will come. We need to be moving now.
My friends, don't you see we need this child if we want to find Dryland?
I'm not goin'. Nobody is.
[ Woman ] We've already seen their smoke on the horizon. Know what that is yet?
Know what that is yet? The numbers? Yes, I think I do.
It seems to be some ancient form of geographic location-- latitude, longitude. It doesn't make sense, though. The numbers, they seem to be backwards or something.
It doesn't make sense, though. The numbers, they seem to be backwards or something.
It doesn't make sense, though. The numbers, they seem to be backwards or something. It's upside down. The world?
It's upside down. The world?
It's upside down. The world? The poles have reversed themselves?
I've been mappin' the cities below.
The world wasn't created in a deluge. It was covered by it.
- [ Man ] That's blasphemy! - [ Helen ] No, it's true. I've seen it with my own eyes. There is land. It's right under our keel.
I've seen it with my own eyes. There is land. It's right under our keel.
None of it's dry anymore. Some is.
Enola's been there. I know that now. I saw what she drew.
So that's why he's going after Enola-- to find Dryland.
I don't care about Dryland.
This is ridiculous. Going after the Smokers?
He doesn't even know which direction they came from.
[ Man ] I say let him go. [ Woman ] We're better off without them anyway!
If she's alive, I'll bring her back to you.
[ Woman ] Forget about the mute-o, Helen.
If he brings her back here, they'll kill us all!
I can't stand it. We gotta go help him. I can't ask him to do this alone.
I can't ask him to do this alone. Oh, don't worry, my dear. You're not going to have to.
You got that tattoo figured out yet?
It would be easier if it was flat-- big and flat.
It needs to be flat. What you got in mind?
Well, you cut it off her back. You stretch it, mount it.
Give us a proper look. Take her down below until I holler.
Saint Joe, we're close.
After centuries of shame.
They're gettin' ugly. Don't I know it.
Announce me, cousin.
[ Microphone Popping ] Hey. Here he is.
[ Crowd ] Deacon!
Rise up, brothers and sisters.
Turn your eyes and open your hearts... to your humble benefactor,
your spiritual shepherd and dictator for life,
the Deacon of the 'Deez.
Look out! It's mine! It's mine!
Deacon! Wahoo!
Children. Children of the provider.
Citizens of the good ship. Please now, hear me speak.
I've had a vision. [ Man ] Yeah, we're tired of your visions!
What about the land you promised us?
[ Crowd ] Yeah! Yeah!
[ Deacon ] O ye of little faith.
I've had a vision so great... that as it came to me, I wept.
- And in this splenditudinous figment of wonder, - Is that Bone's ride?
- And in this splenditudinous figment of wonder, - Is that Bone's ride? - Is that blood on the seat? - I saw--
- Is that blood on the seat? - I saw--
And you know what it is that I saw.
I saw... the land.
- Horse, that you? - [ Engine Revving ]
Look, just bring it in slow, okay? I don't have all day.
- [ Engine Revs ] - Horse!
Just bring it up slow.
I said slow! [ Screams ]
Shouldn't be doing that. You're gonna get in trouble.
Ha. That's right.
You're not afraid. You've got your pet freak comin' to rescue you.
He's not a freak, and he can take you anytime.
He's killed dozens of people, and he doesn't have any mercy or anything.
He even kills little girls.
Haven't we all?
Shit.
It's Horse.
Find him. Find him! Come on!
- [ Crowd Chanting ] - Yes! Yes! Yes!
Come on. Gettin' nervous, aren't you?
I don't get nervous.
[ Deacon ] And if there's a river, we'll dam it.
And if there's a tree, we'll ram it.
'Cause I'm talkin' progress here.
Yes, sir. I'm talkin' development.
[ Man ] Yeah! For we shall suck and savor...
the sweet flavor of Dryland.
[ Crowd Whistling ] [ Enola ] Face is all red.
Helen said with anybody that has a face that red,
he's either had too much sun or too much to drink. All right, that's it. I'm gonna burn your face. Almost time.
All right, that's it. I'm gonna burn your face. Almost time.
- [ Clanging ] What's up? - We're just talkin' about our friend.
[ Doctor ] What's his name? [ Enola ] He doesn't have a name.
So death can't find him. Nah-nah-nah.
Doesn't have a home or people to care for.
He's not afraid of anything, men least of all.
He's fast and strong like a big wind.
He can hear a hundred miles and see a hundred miles underwater. [ Gagging ] He can hide in the shadow of the noon sun.
[ Gagging ] He can hide in the shadow of the noon sun.
He could be right behind you, and you won't even know it till you're dead!
Give it a rest.
He'll come for me. He will.
[ Deacon ] We are the reason-- Yeah?
Well, I hope he does. [ Deacon ] The Lord's creation.
Remember you said that.
[ Deacon Continues ] Look at us.
Look at us here today. [ Man ] Yeah!
Dryland is not just our destination,
- but it is our destiny! - [ Cheering, Whistling ]
Find him. Find him!
How can I find... this glorious place?
And he said to me--
"A child shall lead you."
A child.
- And behold! - It's time.
The instrument of our salvation!
[ Deacon ] Our guide in the wild.
[ Deacon ] Our beacon in the darkness.
Turn her around, Nord.
She has shown me the path!
And before the holy-most moment is upon us,
let's sacrifice one to old Saint Joe.
And let's get this tub of shit up to speed.
Yep.
Pull!
Pull! Pull!
- Pull. - Pull!
So which way we rowin'? I don't have a goddamn clue.
[ Laughs ] Don't worry.
They'll row for a month before they figure out I'm fakin' it.
But, um, wh-wh--
Oh, you want details. Well, I'm not tellin' these savages...
Oh, you want details. Well, I'm not tellin' these savages... that we haven't solved the map yet.
I promised them results, and I'll get 'em if I gotta cut 'em out of her goddamn back.
Who is that? Who is that?
Maybe one of the spare rowers?
Why aren't you rowin'?
- It's him. - It is him.
You guys are in so much trouble.
Well, I'll be damned. It's the gentleman guppy.
You know, he's like a turd that won't flush.
I want the girl.
You know, I thought you were stupid, friend.
[ Gun Cocking ] But I underestimated you.
You are a total freakin' retard.
I want the girl. That's all.
Well, what on this screwed-up earth makes you think you're gonna get her?
You know what this is?
I drop it, you burn.
We all burn. Now wait, wait, wait, wait.
[ Clears Throat ] Let's not do anything rash here.
I mean, uh, are you sure she's worth all this?
She never does stop talkin'. She never shuts up.
I noticed. What is it then?
Huh? It's the map.
She's my friend.
Golly gee. A single tear rolls down my cheek.
I mean, you're gonna die for your friend.
If it comes to that.
- He's bluffing. I'll kill him. - He's not bluffing. He never bluffs.
Shut up!
I don't-- I-I-- I don't think you're gonna drop that torch, my friend.
- Why not? - Because you're not crazy.
No!
Oh, thank God.
Get him!
Let's go, goddamn it!
Don't just stand there! Kill somethin'!
Was this your big vision?
[ Yells ] I've always wanted to drive this monster.
There he is! There he is!
That's him! There!
[ Enola ] No! Let go!
[ Enola ] Let go!
[ Enola ] Let me go! Let go! [ Deacon ] Pilot!
- [ Deacon ] Pilot! - [ Enola ] Let me go!
[ Mariner Cocking Gun ] Let go! Let go-o-o-o!
[ Laughing ] You should've stayed underwater.
Now you know how to fly an airplane? You're lucky I do.
Ow! Now you stop it! You behave yourself now!
[ Helen ] It's going down.
You can see it sinking. Gregor, bring us right down on top of it.
Hurry, Gregor! [ Gregor ] Don't worry.
Hurry.
Enola! Up here!
Grab on!
[ Gregor ] Are they on yet?
- [ Gregor ] What is it? - [ Helen ] I don't know!
No!
Gotcha! I'm gonna rip your cute little lungs out.
Pull! Almost.
[ Shrieks ] [ Helen ] No! - [ Enola Screaming ] - [ Helen ] No! Enola!
Saint Joe. Hole in one.
- Helen! - [ Helen ] No! Enola! - [ Gregor ] Helen!
Hey! Hey!
Oh. Oh, no! Quick! What are we gonna do?
Tie this off.
- [ Gregor ] Hurry! - Tie it!
- Got it! - [ Enola ] Ah!
Get 'em up now.
- [ Gregor ] Of course! North is south. - What?
- South is north. - I was swimming.
I saw. [ Gregor ] My friends.
My friends, look.
If I take a bearing from the sun and reverse the coordinates on Enola's back,
then Dryland is that way.
[ Helen Laughing ] It's fresh! All of this! It's fresh!
All of this! It's fresh!
I found something!
Maybe we should put them under the dirt.
I think it was their way.
[ Gregor ] They must have known they were dying.
I'm home.
Where's the mariner? He was outside.
Wait. Wait! I want to show you this.
First time in your life you got nothin' to say?
Enola, I have to go now.
But you came back for me.
I like you.
Why are you leaving?
I don't belong here. I belong out there. You belong here.
It's too strange here. It doesn't move right.
Helen said that it's only land sickness.
Come on, Ben!
Vincent!
Hurry up!
Vincent, what are you doing?
Vincent!
Okay, Ben. You won!
Vincent?
Admit it. You're looking forward to this.
I got the weekend crowd. They're not even going to notice.
Give me a break, Ben.
You're the one that wants to go.
Vincent!
Vincent!
Ben! You little jerk!
Did you get in and the lid shut on you?
-We go now? -Yeah, right. We go now.
You'll probably play pool with Joey after you close the restaurant.
If you're dumb enough to take three kids to your class reunion...
...I'm smart enough to have a good time.
-Hey, party! -Party hearty!
Ben!
-I'm underwater! -That's great news.
Where's your brother?
I don't know.
Will you go find Vincent, please?
Did you remember the sandwiches?
Of course not.
Bethie, if your head wasn't screwed on--
You'd find it sitting by the microwave.
Then I'd have to call you in Chicago.
Who needs a head at a high-school reunion?
I want to stay with Dad and go to the restaurant.
I'm not going to Chicago!
You're going!
I hate Ben, I hate Kerry...
...and I hate....
Let me finish out the roll.
-Pat, now? -Just two shots!
By the lilacs. It'll take just a second.
All right, look at Daddy.
I know, the photographer hates having her picture taken.
Everybody say...
...meatball!
Benbo, bologna is for eating...
...not washing windows.
Your seat belt's loose.
Mom, sing me...
...that bunny song.
I wish I was still home with Dad.
Sing me, If a bunny catch a bunny
If a bunny catch a bunny
-Coming through the rye -I hate this song!
If a bunny...
...kiss a bunny
And made a bunny cry
You're here.
I'm here!
Just a second, let me get Kerry. No, no. Let me get her.
Look at her!
Watch your head, Benbo.
I'm your godmama, Kerry.
Remember me?
God love her! Look at her.
My God!
Is that Ben?
Ben! You're a grown-up.
Vincent, can you swim?
Martha's inside, waiting for you.
Come on, sweetie.
I have a surprise!
Where's your tooth?
I lost it.
Speak of the devil!
Beth, you remember Martha, the babysitter from God.
Great! Can you help with Kerry?
Sure thing, Mrs. Cappadora.
Mrs. Cappadora.
Good Christ!
Is there some kind of registration table?
You're set. I stuck it on my card.
Ellen, you can't do that!
It's 70 bucks. Who cares?
Donna Trump, I care.
Besides, I can write it off.
I've got a fashion shoot on Sunday.
Boutique on Oak Street.
You'll have to go up in that mess and rearrange it, then.
Oh, Jesus!
Is that Michelle Pulliam?
Did she ever marry that guy?
They broke up. Then she went out with--
-Elizabeth Kerry and her merry band! -Jimmy!
How're my big guys?
Wow! Vincent! You have gotten so huge!
They'd hug any man with a badge, and so would I.
What would you do if you found out I made detective?
Congratulations!
Guess who I just saw?
Cecil Lockhart.
You mean Cecilia Lockhart?
Star of stage, screen and mouthwash commercials.
My God! There she is.
Remember when she first got laid?
When she was 15, and she told us:
"I can't imagine going a month without it."
She was talking about pizza, guys.
Hey, Beth!
My God! How are you?
-Look at you! How are you? -Good, good.
Is this your new one?
Where's little Vincent?
I'm not little. No, you're not.
No, you're not. -Sandy! Bye-- -Mom, I want to go.
I want pizza!
You stay with your brother.
Martha, would you take care of the car?
-I'll handle it. -I'll pay the thing.
Vincent?
Listen. I want you to hold Ben's hand real tight.
And you guys can play on this really cool cart, okay?
Mom, my neck's hot.
My neck's killing me.
Vincent, listen.
This'll only take a second.
Stay here with Ben while I pay the lady.
When Martha comes, she'll take you swimming, okay?
Thanks.
-Sorry it took so long. -That's okay.
Where's Ben?
He wouldn't let me hold him. Would you look at my neck?
I've got a heat rash or something.
Hold on, sweetie.
Ben?
Ellen?
Ben took off. Would you...?
I'll find him. See you later.
You stay here. Don't move.
Ben?
Have you seen a little boy?
He's got a red baseball cap, 3 years old.
No, sorry.
Thanks.
Ben?
Excuse me.
Vincent... ...think hard.
Which way did Ben go?
I don't know.
Didn't you watch?
I couldn't see him.
He wasn't over there.
We should get the manager.
I don't know.
Maybe if we just wait....
Stop!
Everybody please just listen up for a second.
We need to look for Beth Kerry's little boy.
His name is Ben.
He's 3, he was wearing a red baseball cap.
He was just here a second ago.
So if you'd look around where you are.
Wait. Hold on, folks.
We'll find him. It's going to be fine.
I'm going to divide the room down the middle.
I want you to stay in your half and look around you.
If you see Ben...
...pick him up and call out to me, all right?
Pat will be here soon, right?
I didn't call him.
I thought we'd find Ben right away.
Let's make that call now, right?
Here you go.
Go ahead, Beth.
-Hello? -Patty!
Magill, talk to the female.
Coleman, come with me.
Mrs. Cappadora?
I'm Officer Magill.
You brought a lot of officers.
We take the disappearance of a child very seriously.
You're worried, then?
We'll find him.
Lost kids, we always find them.
And they're okay.
-They're not hurt. -Good.
If it gets to five hours, we usually consider it....
Anyway, we'll find him before then.
So your friend Elaine was with you?
Ellen.
She met me out front. She was waiting for me.
Besides Ellen, who was the first person you talked to?
The cheerleaders.
Would another family member...
...on your side have any reason to pick up the boy?
My folks are dead.
There's nobody.
Has he ever been fingerprinted?
No.
Yes!
The school district had a program.
It's been four hours.
We've got everybody on it, okay?
This is my boss, Detective Supervisor Bliss.
-Bliss? -Candy Bliss.
It sounds like a stripper's name.
The things parents do to kids!
I can't believe I said that.
We'll do everything we can to find your boy.
Description out? They're checking the database now.
Great.
First, I want to tell you this is nobody's fault.
Kids disappear all the time, and somebody always finds them.
That's right.
We're set up over here.
Where is he?
My son! Where is he?
My son! Where is he? We haven't found him yet--
We haven't found him yet-- Where's Ben?
Where's Bethie?
Bethie?
Pat!
How did this happen?
Okay, all right, okay.
It'll be okay.
Where is it nobody's searched? The basement?
It's just food storage. All the doors are kept locked.
But you have freezers, cabinets?
Ben loves hiding places. Take me down there.
You okay?
You sure?
I'm going downstairs a minute. You stay here with Mommy, okay?
Let's go.
Mom!
Patty!
Are you all right?
My God in heaven! How long has he been missing?
About five hours.
They'll remember. They'll make one more call.
I'll take you to the command center.
Kerry and Vincent will come...
...to the house. It's better, right?
-Where's Kerry? -Upstairs.
You'll come with Grandma, honey.
You go with Grandma, Vincent, okay?
Will you tell me when Ben gets back, Mom?
She'll tell us.
Sit down, sweetheart.
I'm sorry. Do you have any other pictures of Ben?
I lost my purse.
No, no, no. I have it, honey.
Ben!
Bethie, honey, it's okay.
Set her down!
I want Ben!
Grab her wrist and hold her down. Medic!
It's okay. It's all right.
Give her something!
Quick!
It's all right, sweetheart. It's all right.
I know, Bethie. I know.
You don't know.
I don't even know.
How long are you staying with your parents?
Do the police have leads?
Have the kidnappers tried to contact you?
How long were you gone before you noticed your son was missing?
-Who'd want to do this? -How long will you be in Chicago?
He's 3 years old...
...but he's big for his age.
And people always think he's older.
He's very verbal.
He babbles to himself.
Sometimes you can barely hear him...
...but he says his words very clearly.
He has blond hair and blue eyes. And he was wearing...
...a red baseball cap.
And he loves pizza.
He's very afraid of the water.
He loves... ...to sing songs.
Sometimes he'll sing the same song over and over again.
He was wearing...
...red shoes.
High-top sneakers with green parrots on the side.
And white socks.
And a red T-shirt...
And a red T-shirt... ...with yellow sleeves...
...and little blue shorts. Blue plaid shorts.
Call you when we get home.
Unbelievable, right?
Diane Lundgren's on her way over...
...and Cecil Lockhart signed up.
But her mother got sick.
You know who else called?
Lizzy De Nunzio.
-Where is she now, Switzerland? -I think she moved there.
-How'd she even find out about it? -Who knows?
But she just sounds sick about it.
-Everyone is, Bethie. -I know.
I know.
Laurie!
I can't believe you're here.
What was I supposed to do? Stay in Madison? Watch CNN?
Hey, Tommy.
Have you seen Candy?
-She's with McGuire. -Thanks, Ricky.
Then go to Minneapolis. How far can it be?
We've been getting bogus leads...
...every day for six weeks now. This kid is dead and you know it.
Don't tell me I know it! I don't know it.
This is interstate. I have to call the FBI.
Come on, Candy, the FBI?
Give me a break.
Hey, Bethie.
So you heard that?
I heard something about the FBI.
Come into my office.
Have a seat.
Listen, Beth.
Just because volunteers are going home...
...doesn't mean the case is closed.
Some of them got lives.
I don't.
So I'm here.
And I'm not giving up.
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I'm a jerk.
There's nothing wrong with what you just did.
There's nothing wrong with what you just did. I'm just an oversensitive jerk.
You're too involved. You can't--
I'm black.
I'm a woman. I'm a detective supervisor.
And I'm gay. Did you know that?
I always feel like the eyes of Texas are on me.
Every time I hug Katie from Crime Stoppers...
...I think she thinks I'm coming on to her.
-I wasn't-- -No, I know that.
I just wanted you to know I'm a little jerkish today.
So that calls for a Gummi Bear.
Tough guys chew Gummi Bears.
Beth, you laughed.
You only laughed.
It doesn't mean our side loses points.
It doesn't mean you'll kill your son because you laughed.
You have got to survive.
That's just it.
I don't want to survive Ben.
I don't want to face it.
Then I guess you can just...
...move into a corner in my office, and I'll use you as a coat rack.
You got to do whatever you got to do.
But you got two great kids, which I would give my right arm for.
Though you think you're a terrible mother...
...you're the only mother they have.
I should go home.
Jill's been great with Kerry.
Really great.
But I think Vincent's going to need a little time.
He'll be fine. He's been back, what, six weeks?
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Coming?
Jill, we're back!
Baby, you scared me.
How's my big guy?
Are you good?
Mom, guess what?
On Thursday, I made six baskets in a row!
Look how long your legs are.
How is she? Has she been in bed all day?
Pretty much.
How'd Vincent get home? Did you pick him up?
Yeah, I didn't have class today.
Okay, thanks.
Did she say she was coming down?
No, she didn't.
So some girl walks in, chewing gum...
...and talking through her nose...
...has legs up to her neck.
Paolo just says, "Great, you're hired!"
The new kids we got...
...don't know spaghetti from scampi.
They think the cash register is their personal savings account.
I'll tell you what...
...when I open my own place...
...this is exactly what you won't see.
Guess what happened.
I thought today was Sunday.
Isn't that funny?
Can we just please go?
I'm going to work, honey.
Beth, you downstairs?
Honey, what are you doing?
Ever been in a doctor's office without a People magazine?
One day, Ben will go to a doctor's office with whoever took him.
-And some other patient-- -Laurie, stop! Okay?
I know you mean well, but just...
...stop.
-That's real leather? -You bet!
-Thanks, Uncle Joey. -You're welcome.
Check this out, buddy.
Could be more presents.
Merry Christmas!
Joey, it's cold. Shut the door.
-Where's the tree? -Pat went to get it.
Where's my presents?
Merry Christmas, Beth!
Mom, look, Uncle Joey gave me my stocking present early...
...because it's too big to fit in the stocking.
-See? -Yeah, that's great!
Merry Christmas, Beth.
-Merry Christmas, Theresa. -How you feeling, honey?
I almost didn't make it. I started having Braxton-Hicks.
-You should breathe in a bag. -I'll try that.
-May be a Christmas baby. -I hope not.
She's carrying like it's a boy. That's what everybody says.
The gang's all here!
-My God, sis, look how big you are! -Don't rub it in.
Patty, it's beautiful!
-Who do you think these are for? -Me?
One is from me, and one's from Grandpa Angelo.
-Help me wrap. -Look at the cards.
Did you buy out the whole store?
Who's counting? It's Christmas.
Now, these are very special.
Look, Mom, they're for Ben from Grandma and Grandpa.
Rosie, what are these?
Presents for Ben.
Why did you bring presents for Ben?
I believe that Ben will be found.
When he is found, I want him to know his family didn't forget him.
Do you have the impression we've forgotten Ben?
Of course not.
-We didn't get Ben any gifts. -I understand that.
I didn't even want to go through...
...this whole, big holiday act.
You know what I wanted to do? I wanted to sleep through it.
When you do this, like he's just...
...out of town on some business trip and he'll be back anytime--
-Beth, take it easy. -Take it easy!
How can I take it easy when nobody except me...
...seems to want to accept the fact that it's over?
It's over!
We're all going to go on eating and sleeping--
You have to snap out of this. No one can talk to you.
I can't.
-Pat can't. -Butt out!
If you don't have hope Ben will come back--
Come back? He's not even 4 yet.
What's he going to do? Get an Amtrak schedule?
We didn't mean anything by it.
-Don't you think we're all grieving? -I mean it!
-Shut up! -No, Pat!
You're all scared to say this, but I'm not.
We try and call. She doesn't want to talk.
We write. She doesn't answer.
Mom, Ben will be back tomorrow.
What?
Because it's Christmas. For my present...
...I asked Santa to bring Ben home.
I think he'll do it.
-Where is she? -She's upstairs.
She still won't speak to me, will she?
I think she will.
Everybody's been calling.
After your talk with People, we reprinted the poster five times.
I think she hates my guts.
What are you doing?
Ending world hunger.
I just got off the phone with the U.N.
That's good.
Look, will you just forgive me...
...and get this over with?
I'd never give them anything unless it was the right thing to do.
I would never do a thing to hurt you.
How long have we been friends?
One thousand years.
-I know. -Then good, okay?
I have something I want you to do.
I don't believe you.
-I want you to take a picture. -I don't do that anymore.
I took early retirement.
You could use the money.
This is good money.
Good for what?
I want her to take a portrait of a Chinese family.
We are kind of tapped out, just keeping Vincent in sneakers.
You could do this.
You wouldn't even have to go out.
I threw away all my paper and stuff.
I'll go get you more paper and stuff.
Please.
Please, just this once.
Let me get rid of my guilt by doing you this one good turn.
This is not a good turn. This is a setup.
These are really beautiful.
I have to print. I have four phone calls to make.
I have to get Vincent ready for Little League.
Thought any more about Chicago?
What about it?
Could be great.
Kids'll love it there.
-I'll have my own restaurant. -I have to get Kerry up.
-There's plenty of time for that. -Okay, fine.
You go upstairs, get my diaphragm, fill it up with gunk and...
...we'll have eight minutes before I have to feed Vincent.
We can have a lot of fun in eight minutes.
Fine. You want to do it right here?
I can make toast at the same time.
It's not like I'm on top of you all the time.
We make love as often as we pay the water bill.
I don't see why you need a diaphragm every time.
I don't want to get pregnant every time.
We had three kids and we always wanted more. I miss that.
I miss this house being full of noise.
I used to want to run up the walk to lunch.
It's not going to change anything.
Another kid. It'd be like a replacement part.
Like you get a new gravy boat so you don't spoil the set.
That's a lousy fucking thing to say.
I agree. So I'll stop saying fucking lousy things.
I'm not having a baby, and I'm not moving to Chicago... ...so you can start a restaurant with your dad.
...so you can start a restaurant with your dad.
You want a new baby and restaurant? You need a new wife.
All I want is for us to be a family again.
Nothing's wrong with that.
That's healthy!
You want to know what it's like?
It's like I'm standing under this giant...
It's like I'm standing under this giant... ...snowbank.
If I move one inch in any direction...
...it's going to come crashing down...
...and bury me.
Do you know...
...I don't dare think of him for a full minute?
One inch...
...and the whole thing's going to come down.
You will have to raise these kids by yourself.
I'm doing that now.
That's right.
Pat's always been the rock.
Isn't that what it said in People?
There was Pat holding together that poor, crazy woman... ...and those sweet little kids. You're such a hero.
...and those sweet little kids. You're such a hero.
All right, stop this.
You would never have let Ben get lost. I mean it. Stop it.
You wouldn't have been such a shitty parent...
...who can't remember the sandwiches...
...who can't get Kerry's bottle together!
That's right, I wouldn't!
If you'd just pay attention to somebody besides yourself!
None of this would have happened, right?
Scream!
Come on, Kerry. Scream!
I was there to pick up after you!
You self-righteous son of a bitch!
I'm not self-righteous! I'm right!
Kids don't just vanish up in smoke.
Kids don't just get lost.
People lose them!
Vincent, what happened?
What happened, honey?
Why was she screaming?
Is she all right?
Yeah, she's fine.
Where are we going?
Just thought I'd take a drive.
She just misses him, Daddy.
That's right, Vincent.
That's right.
This is the bar and the waiting area.
That's the wine rack. Dad's personal design.
People sit here while they wait for tables.
That's the kitchen back there...
...and this is it.
The murals are done.
Tables will be through here...
...and they'll carry back over to there.
This is the dance floor.
There'll be a live band over here...
...Thursday through Sunday.
Theresa, is that a town in Italy?
You like it, honey?
It's La Bohème.
You're Mimi and I'm Rodolfo.
-Except she lives in the end. -Well, good.
-It's gorgeous. It really is. -Can you believe this place?
I don't.
I can't wait.
That's a good one. We got to get in that.
Alex, come on, listen.
So what's Mr. Tough Guy up to?
Apart from needing a haircut.
I don't know.
He's making friends, I guess.
He's been on the phone a lot lately.
If you're using that phone for your bookie operation...
-...it'll be a part of your anatomy. -I'm not, Dad. Jesus!
I got to go.
Well, this is really nice.
It is, isn't it?
New house, new restaurant.
You're doing a really good imitation of having a life.
You have the biggest snarl right here.
No, wait, Kerry. Just one more.
Are you in sixth?
Yeah. You're in third.
You were the soybean, right?
Actually, I was the feed corn.
Who do you have?
-Cook. -Yeah, I had Cook.
She's pretty decent.
Mommy?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I was leaving my number in case you needed your lawn mowed.
But I'll come back later.
I really do need my lawn mowed.
Could you do it today?
Yeah. Sure.
I'll get my stuff. I live two blocks down there.
You don't need a mower! We have a mower.
My brother's supposed to do it.
He's in high school. He's lazy!
Do you know that boy?
It's not talking to strangers if you're in your own house.
I know.
That's true. Do you know his name?
It's Jason. He's on patrol.
No, wait, I'm wrong.
Jason wears the beanie hat. He got reported.
You don't know his name?
It's Sam Kero.
Kero something.
Mom, where are you going?
Are you going to work?
You know what?
I have to take some leaf pictures.
It's okay if you go across the street and play with Blythe.
I'm taking pictures of leaves.
That's my job. I take pictures.
Shit!
Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father who takes away sin.
Have mercy on us. Have mercy on us.
I want you to go downstairs and order a pizza.
Do that, then go to Blythe's...
...get Kerry and put on a video for her.
Get the money from my purse.
I have to work in the darkroom.
It's very important and it can't wait.
I want you to give Kerry pizza. Will you do that?
Don't I always? Jesus!
It is, isn't it?
Is this possible?
Here's the aging projection they did around the time he was 8.
Who is he?
He came to the door to mow lawns. I let him mow the lawn.
He's coming back tomorrow. He ran out of gas.
Where does he live?
Two blocks.
Two blocks from here?
Did he just move here?
I don't know how long....
Kerry knows him from school, and she's been at Sandburg...
...for what, two years? Good Christ!
He's probably just some kid who looks like Ben.
-His hair is darker. -No, you're right.
Let's call Candy. Then we're going to that house.
It's late at night. He's sleeping.
We don't even know his last name.
Two blocks from here. I mean....
-When he saw you, did he-- -Nothing.
He had no idea. But he was 3, and he doesn't know this house.
I'm going to call Pop.
Don't tell him. Not until we know.
No, I just....
I'm not going to work tomorrow.
What were you doing on the porch?
I was watching the sun come up.
-You got a ride? -Kenny's dad is picking me up.
Finish up.
-I'm riding my bike. -No, you're not.
I'm 9 now. I'm older than the other 18 kids in my class.
People who live in walking distance don't ride bikes.
Besides, you don't have a bike lock.
Could you get me one?
Yes, I'll get you a bike lock today. I promise.
You can ride your bike to school tomorrow.
Come on, let's go.
Bye, Mom.
Vincent, wait.
I love you.
-I want you to know I love you. -Thank you, Mom.
I know it sounds insane.
I don't know if it's him for sure.
I don't know what I know.
It can't be Ben... ...but it's Ben.
Isn't it?
I say we go in.
He's in protective custody.
We got an unmarked in front of the suspect's house.
We snatched the kid from school.
The principal probably called the father.
What are we waiting for?
There's a process involved here.
It's not like you're bringing him home today.
He'll have to go to foster care. He'll need counseling.
There'll be a period of transition.
Anyway, we want to make sure we I.D. the boy 100%.
Look at the picture!
It's the same kid. It's Sam Karras!
Don't go off half-cocked on me. This is a big case.
It wouldn't hurt to get a warrant.
I got the warrant.
I talked to the D.A.
Bliss.
Thank you.
The fingerprints match.
You folks ready for this?
You don't get to be ready for this.
They're busting you for hot-wiring Jamie's car.
I don't think so. I'm going to call you later, okay?
Shit!
Come in here, will you please?
This is Chief Bastokovich.
Kerry's got Girl Scouts, right?
I think....
She won't be home till after five?
Right.
You saw that picture this morning.
That's why the police are here.
I thought it was a fire drill. Can I just go upstairs?
Listen to me.
We think the boy in that picture is Ben.
The kid in that house on Maple, right?
You saw him?
You saw Ben? I didn't know it was Ben. I'd see this kid goofing around.
I didn't know it was Ben. I'd see this kid goofing around. I mean, he looked--
I never really thought about it much.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me or your father?
Tell you what?
I found my long-lost brother?
Would you have listened to me?
Would you have even heard me?
When did you first see him?
How long have we lived here?
It doesn't matter now.
I'll tell you when--
-I'll tell you. -Fine. Do that.
Hi, Pop.
They're about to move on him.
Ready.
You stay here.
We'll call you in 15 minutes.
I'm coming in.
I'm coming in.
You don't say anything. Just listen.
George Karras?
-What's wrong? -I'm Detective Candy Bliss.
Do you have a 12-year-old boy named Sam living in this house?
Yes, I do.
My God, my son. Is he hurt?
No, he's fine.
He's in the custody of Protective Services.
What are you talking about? He's at school.
You're under arrest for kidnapping...
...in connection with the abduction... ...June 3rd, 1988, of Benjamin Cappadora.
You have the right to remain silent.
What you say can and will be used against you....
You've got the wrong house.
The people that lost their boy live around the corner.
Over on Drummond.
No, no.
My neighbor knows the family. This is a big mistake.
Do you understand these rights as I've read them?
Of course I do.
Can we come in?
Sure.
We have a warrant to search the premises.
-Can you step over here? -This is a mistake.
-You don't have any guns? -No, I don't.
You won't mind if the officers search here?
I didn't do anything. This is my house. I was just doing the books.
I don't even know why you people are here.
That's Cecil.
That's Cecil Lockhart.
You know her from television?
Why do you have a picture of Cecil Lockhart?
She was my wife.
Cecil gave birth in 1985...
...which is the same year Ben was born.
Apparently, the baby had complications and died.
She had a nervous breakdown. They had to put her away.
She got out three years after that, just in time...
...to make it to the reunion, where she saw Ben and snatched him.
She disappeared into Minneapolis...
...where she met George and married him.
He adopted Ben...
...and then they moved here.
About five years ago, she committed suicide.
I got to tell you, I feel...
...totally responsible...
...for a lot of what's happened.
We interviewed this woman.
I sat in this woman's house. I had tea with her.
And somewhere in there was Ben...
...and I missed him.
George Karras wasn't at all suspicious, and he adopted Ben.
So she lied to her husband.
She lied to me.
I'm supposed to know when people are lying because I'm a supercop.
I didn't find him. You guys did.
No one found him.
He found us.
Are you heading to the foster home now?
What will you say to him?
How's it feel to get your son back?
Did you contact him at all in the last two weeks?
Will you call him Ben or Sam?
Do you have any statement to make?
How are you?
I'm good.
Dad?
-Yes? -Yeah, Sam?
Stop fidgeting.
You're not hungry? I'm eating.
I'm not an industrial vacuum, like some people.
Could I have some milk?
You do milk with pizza?
I like milk with pizza.
-Good night, Kerry. -Good night, Mom.
Do you want the light on?
No, I don't sleep with a light.
Do you want an extra blanket or anything?
I'm okay.
The Bulls are home tomorrow. Do you want to go?
Good night.
I'll put an extra blanket there, just in case.
If he needs one, he'll ask for it.
He doesn't know how cold this house gets.
Please relax, honey. Okay?
-Relax. He's home. -Oh, God.
I just want to go in and look at him.
Here, just wear these.
I hate those.
You loved those socks three days ago.
It's not for church. I want tights.
Pick out whatever you want, but hurry. I have to get dressed.
Why doesn't he like us?
-Who? -Ben.
Sam.
He does.
It's just, he's....
Even though he's your brother...
...this is all very new for him.
He just needs time to--
He just needs time to get used to us.
And we have to help him, okay?
Hurry.
Today, we celebrate the presence among us...
...in their wholeness...
...of the Cappadora family.
As you all know, their son Ben was taken from them...
...and, by what can only be called...
...a modern-day miracle, returned to them just weeks ago...
...not maimed, not torn...
...but healthy and whole.
I ask you to join with them today...
...in their gratitude and their faith.
I'm also asked to remind you...
...of the celebration at Cappadora's Restaurant...
...immediately following the mass.
Are you okay?
Yeah, Dad.
-I'm so happy for you! -Thank you, Susan.
Congratulations!
That's the big brother.
I want us all to walk in together.
Yes, Mom. The perfect family.
Welcome home.
Thank you.
The table's here.
Loosen up, man.
I'll show you something.
This is called the tarantella.
It's an Italian dance. You want to learn it?
You can learn it.
I don't know this dance. I only know the Hasapiko.
-You'll have to say it again. -Hasapiko.
Hey, guys, can you hold it?
My son doesn't know the tarantella...
...but he knows the Hasapiko. You know it?
-Of course. -Great!
I better go up there.
Put your arm out.
Come over here.
Ready?
Right, back...
...right, together.
Left, together.
Right, back, right, together.
Yes, Mr. Karras?
I came to bring you Sam's records.
Photos.
This is his...
...medical chart.
This is his dental.
One cavity in his permanent teeth when he was 10.
Report cards....
You'll see.
A little trouble in math.
You know, this....
This was my wife...
...and my son.
This wasn't some lunatic and the boy she kidnapped.
Not to me.
Good night.
What did he want?
We missed a lot of years.
Where you been playing?
City League.
Traveling squad.
First string.
Traveling squad?
My goodness!
Hey, I'm in sixth.
Most of the other guys are in ninth. It's all about height.
Yeah, sure.
Play Horse?
-That was pretty. -Not bad.
You on varsity?
I will be.
Coach is such an asshole, though.
Okay, free throw.
-Right here? -Wherever.
That's an "H." Get ready for this one.
That's an "O."
I thought this was Horse.
Okay, buddy.
Ready to go downtown?
Wait a second. It's not your shot.
This ain't the city rec, Ben.
It's not "Ben."
Okay, Ben.
What are we playing to now?
Just play.
Ever seen that in the city rec, Sammy?
In girls'.
Oh, shit!
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
-What's wrong with you? -Jesus Christ, Dad!
Are you okay? Sure?
Can you go one day without making some kind of trouble?
Can you go one day without making some kind of trouble? What happened to him?
What do you care?
We were just playing ball.
Really. We were just having fun.
And that's Vincent's.
See?
It's his christening gown.
This is what we brought him home from the hospital in.
Do you want to see yours?
They're so little.
They look like doll clothes.
-What's that smell? -It's cedar.
It's from the chest.
It's supposed to keep moths away.
Haven't you ever smelled it before?
Maybe my grandmother had a chest like this.
What?
Are you remembering something?
Beth, can I see my dad today?
I really want to see him.
Sure.
I already told you. That's why I want to go to my grandma's.
It's what I do for Thanksgiving every year of my life.
It's a very special day for us.
It's a very special day for us too.
My cousins come, my grandma cooks...
...the whole week before.
After turkey, we go outside and play football.
When we come in, we have pie...
...and watch TV with my dad.
The whole family is coming.
Grandma Rosie, Grandpa Angelo-- No! I'm not staying here.
No! I'm not staying here.
Why do I have to care about them?
You never even met my grandma.
You don't like my dad.
You don't care about what he thinks.
Of course we like George, Sam.
Then let me spend Thanksgiving with him.
The fact is, you're our son.
Not George's. This is one thing we're doing as a family.
-And it's not negotiable. -You just want to show me off.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.
Life magazine! I can't believe...
...the work you're getting.
You know why I'm getting the work.
Because you're the best, kiddo.
Yeah, right.
Same reason Pat's restaurant's always full...
...and Vincent's got a lot of new friends.
Are you saying it's the celebrity?
I think the word is "notoriety."
Where are we eating? And more to the point, drinking?
Do you like clams?
Go this way.
How's it going with Vincent and Sam?
Vincent's so busy getting ready for the basketball tryouts...
...he's ignoring everyone.
Sam probably thinks....
I don't know what Sam thinks. He's still so...
...uncomfortable...
...all the time now. His grades are falling apart.
I don't know.
Well, what's Pat say?
You know Pat. He thinks Sam's going to be fine.
He thinks everything's going to be fine.
And what do you think?
I don't know.
It's just going to take some time.
Do you know what the great Chicago fire of 1871 is?
Peshtigo, there was an even worse fire...
...in the same year on the same day.
Every single building in the town burned.
Hundreds of people died. But Chicago was a big city...
...so that's the fire everybody paid attention to.
There's a beautiful graveyard. I want to get some shots.
Basically...
...it's the story of what happened. What we talked about in the car.
Look at this, Sam. He was only 14 years old.
That must've been so sad.
But look, 1869.
He died two years before the fire.
Maybe he killed himself, like my mom.
I mean, Cecilia.
Why do you think that?
Here, look through here.
Like, for Cecilia, I think she was just too sad.
So maybe this guy was...
...too sad too, you know?
What do you mean?
There could be worse things than being dead.
Like what?
You know how much we love you.
Yeah, I know you do...
...and Pat and Kerry.
And Vincent too.
Yeah, right.
Really, he's like that with all of us.
He's had a hard time.
What about me?
I love my dad.
And I loved my mom too.
She didn't mean to be sick.
Why do I have to be punished when it wasn't my fault?
Do you know how much I've missed holding you...
...all these years?
And how many years you didn't have me to hug you?
They hugged me.
They hugged me all the time.
Sam, what do you wish?
You can say.
That everything was like it was before.
But that would hurt you and Pat, and I couldn't stand that either.
I don't know.
-Sam's gone. -What do you mean?
He's not in his room. I can't find him.
-Did you look downstairs? -He's not there. I can't find him.
-Did you talk to Vincent? -He's asleep. His door's locked.
-What about Kerry? -She's asleep too.
I'm sorry. He did it again.
What'd he do?
He's been sneaking out and coming to my house.
He crawls into his old bed and sleeps.
Vincent told me he knew all about it.
-You knew? -I brought him back, didn't I?
How long has this been going on?
Not that long.
I had a feeling something was wrong, so this time...
...I brought him back myself.
You knew and didn't tell me? He's home, okay?
This time, anyhow.
-Go up to your room. -Why?
-What did I do? -You ran away!
You scared the hell out of your mom and me!
That's not going to happen. You understand me?
No, I don't understand. I'm sick of this whole thing!
No, I don't understand. I'm sick of this whole thing! I don't see why I have to live two blocks from my own house.
I don't see why I have to live two blocks from my own house.
I've been trying for three months.
Three months!
You want me to come home, Dad, right?
Come on, tell them.
He's been asking me why can't he live with me.
I told him what his mother did was very wrong.
She didn't know what she was doing.
She was sick.
We know how hard this has been for you.
We know how much you miss George.
But this is your home.
Sam, go upstairs now.
I hate you.
I hate all of you!
You too, Dad, and I'm never coming back!
Jesus, I want to do right by him.
I want him to be happy.
If you can give him the family he deserves...
...goddamn it, you give him that!
But I've never seen him like this before.
He's never been sad more than a day in his life.
Right now, he's the saddest boy in the world.
You know, what happened last night, that's just the tip of it.
I'm going to say this just once.
I love you.
I've been in love with you your whole life.
But you know what I've seen about you?
You've made a career out of being unhappy.
-That is not fair. -But I'm not like that.
If I have a chance to be happy, I'm going to be happy.
Can't you just try and let us all be happy?
What about Sam?
Just keep being a mother to him.
Help him get through this.
He doesn't know who we are.
He doesn't remember us.
We are holding him against his will.
Where are you going with this?
If you think I'm going to lose my kid again--
If you think I'm going to lose my kid again-- I can't ignore that because you finally...
...have your life the way you want it.
It's like we are the kidnappers now.
We're not the kidnappers!
Sam will be fine. He'll get through this.
It's you!
Losing your kid once wasn't enough, was it?
You know something?
You're right.
I wasn't there. I let it happen.
It only took a minute, and we've paid for it.
I have and you have...
...and Vincent has, but I don't think that means...
...that Sam has to pay for it too. Does it?
We are where we are.
How we got here doesn't matter. What matters is...
...what do we do now?
Don't push me on this, Beth.
I want to give him back.
I can't do that.
Then I want you to let me do what I have to do.
Can you get your bags okay?
I'll try Jay again, but if we can't get him out... ...for the weekend, I won't have a problem.
...for the weekend, I won't have a problem.
Don't you think he's been through enough?
Something's got to get his attention.
Maybe he's doing this to get your attention.
Candy, he's always had my attention.
He is so angry with me.
Things are really bad.
I know. But I think he's right about Vincent.
I can't win with Vincent. He hates me.
He doesn't hate you. What are you talking about? He loves you.
Have you never seen the way that he looks at you?
All he wants you to do is to forgive him.
Forgive him?
For all the shit he's pulled and the shit you don't know he's pulled.
He's so much like you. He takes everything onto himself.
How do you think he's feeling now that Sam is gone?
You okay?
I'm fine.
Do you need anything?
I think you'll have to stay here another day or so.
It's the weekend.
I'm fine.
Headache. It's no big deal.
Do you know how lucky you were?
Mr. Teeter's car was totaled.
-You could've been-- -I don't need this right now.
What are you doing here?
I've been doing fine without you.
I don't think you have been.
I'm sorry.
We're going to get you out of here.
Dad's working on it.
Pat? Jay just called.
He says we can pick Vincent up in the morning.
All right. Thank you.
Can't we get past this?
This isn't just about losing Sam.
What is it about?
Listen to me.
The Sam that's in your head...
...he doesn't exist.
The family that's in your head...
...doesn't exist either.
This family is not in my head.
It's very real.
It's you and me...
...and Kerry and Vincent.
After what he pulled, I pray I find a way... ...to get him through high school in one piece...
...to get him through high school in one piece...
...and get him to believe he can get through life without fouling up!
You are right.
You're right about Vincent, but you're wrong about Sam.
You don't know him. You don't want to know him.
And you don't know me anymore either.
I have known you--
Part of you liked it when I was falling apart...
...and you were holding this family together...
...making the decisions. But now...
...I don't need you to pull me out of bed...
...and make me pay attention to the kids.
I have to go to work.
But I do need you.
Why?
Tell me what for.
I need you to love me.
You got a visitor.
Everyone I've ever met in my life has already been here.
Name's Sam Karras.
You gonna see him or not?
So...
...you okay?
They gave me 5 to 10. But I'm reasonably okay.
I'm kidding.
Were you drunk?
I was over-served.
Yeah, Sam, I was drunk.
So what do you want?
I just thought....
I thought we could be friends.
Friends?
Tell me how we can be friends.
You come back. You leave.
You go in and out our window.
I don't know you, Ben.
Sam! Whatever your name is.
You're a concept. You follow me?
-That's not my fault. -"Not my fault"!
You always whine about whose fault it is. Who cares?
Look, I got my own life now.
It's pretty un-fun at the moment. Tell me what you want.
You're my brother.
I missed you.
Sometimes, I even thought I shouldn't have.
Whatever, you're my brother.
You should go now, Sam.
I'm sorry. You're a good kid.
You're fine, but I'm--
-Maybe I'll visit you when I'm out-- -Wait!
I gotta tell you something.
I remembered something.
What do you mean?
Well, when I was at your house...
...Beth showed me this old trunk.
It was full of old baby clothes.
I didn't remember anything.
Yeah. So?
But I remembered the smell.
From being inside the trunk.
Hide-and-seek.
Did that really happen?
Yeah.
You let the lid shut and it caught.
I knew it.
I knew it!
Finally, you came and opened the top.
You were just there.
Not scared or anything.
See? That's what I remember.
What?
That I wasn't scared.
Because I knew you'd come and find me.
What the hell are you doing?
Nothing.
Want to play?
It's midnight and it's cold, in case you haven't noticed.
Yeah. So?
Jesus, Sam! Does George know you're here?
Yeah. Come on down.
You just want to get me arrested again, don't you?
Ever heard of disturbing the peace?
We could play quiet.
What's the matter? Come on!
All right.
What are you waiting for?
-Easy, Sam. -All right.
Losers out to 11, win by 2?
What's the matter? You asleep or something?
This way?
Which way?
Quit fouling me!
You got to say, "beat." You are beat, right?
I let you.
Sure.
Let's call it a night.
Come back tomorrow for a rematch.
Well, the thing is, I'm not going back.
What do you mean?
What are you doing?
George knows.
We talked about it a lot last week.
He knows why I came here so late.
Which is why?
I didn't want to have this whole big thing with you...
...and Beth and Pat.
Sam?
Is this permanent?
I don't know.
I mean, maybe.
If I can.
Jesus, what is this, your cinder block collection?
I was the one.
I let go of your hand.
This thing is heavy.
My dad--
-George helped me carry it. -Did you hear what I said?
Yeah. So what?
I let go of your hand, Sam.
I told you to get lost. That's what I said.
-I said, "Get lost!" -Big deal.
Everybody says stuff like that. "Get lost!"
Here's the deal. Make it-take it to 11.
Gotta win by two.
Loser carries it up alone.
Come on, man!
Are you too tired to play?
Come on, let's go.
They'll wake up the neighborhood.
Let them play.
I just--
Let's get some sleep.
that the Germans dedicated manpower
and trains and trucks and energy
towards the destruction of the Jews to the last day.
Had they stopped six months before the end of the war and dedicated that energy
towards strengthening themselves, they may have carried on the war a little longer.
But it was more important to them to kill the Jews
than even winning the war.
[Irene Zisblatt] I grew up in a town called Polyana, in the Carpathian mountains.
It was a small town of two main streets.
This leads all the way up to… There is a church over there…
We had a post office and a town hall and a church and a synagogue.
Everybody knew each other.
It was beautiful.
[Renee Firestone] I lived in a town called Uzhhorod.
It was a small town,
yet it had the feel of a big, cosmopolitan town.
Right here was a little deli, right around… right here, and, uh…
My… We used to come here to have our sandwiches for the afternoon.
[Alice Lok Cahana] We lived in a town called Sárvár.
It's in Hungary, close to the, um, Austrian border.
Every day, the peasants would bring their wares from the neighboring villages
in big baskets, and they would carry it on their head or on their shoulders.
Szaszovo was a very small, little community
consisting of 3,000 people.
No electricity, no utilities at all.
So it was… I lead a very simplistic, boring life. Nothing exciting.
But then Budapest, where I ended up, was an entirely different life.
It was an enormous adjustment.
And I looked at this city just going, "Whoa!"
I mean, it was like… I've never believed anything like this exists!
[Tom Lantos] Budapest was a magnificent, world-class city,
on par with Vienna or Paris or London as a great European capital.
This magnificent Parliament building
saw the best and the worst in Hungarian history.
The bulk of the Jews in Budapest
were utterly assimilated, deeply patriotic,
and enormously proud of their Hungarian cultural heritage.
There were about 800 Jewish families  in our town.
And I think the town was 10,000 or 11,000 non-Jews.
I had non-Jewish friends. I dated non-Jewish boys.
My parents had non-Jewish friends.
We also felt quite Hungarian at the same time.
Not just Jewish.
So, Judaism was our religion,
but we were Hungarians.
[reporter 1] On August 2nd, 1934, officers and men swear the oath of allegiance
not to Germany, but to Hitler personally.
[reporter 2] As Hitler's rule over Germany became absolute,
to his alarmed neighbor Austria,
Hitler promised to keep hands off.
[Tom Lantos] In 1938, when I was 10 years old,
I bought my first newspaper.
And I saw the headlines,
"Hitler marches into Austria."
And I sensed that this historic moment
will have a tremendous impact on the lives of Hungarian Jews, my family, and myself.
[reporter 3] Germany invades Poland and Danzig.
Warsaw is bombed, blasted and shelled.
Poland is in ruins.
[Renee Firestone] There were refugees coming to Hungary running away from Poland,
and most of the Jewish families, Friday night the men went to temple
to bring these people home and give them shelter.
They would come and tell stories.
And I remembered very often…
you didn't believe them.
I heard a conversation between my father and another man.
And he was telling my father what the Nazis are doing in Poland.
And one thing that I'll never forget that I heard…
And he said the Nazis are taking our young Jewish infants,
and they're tearing them in half by their legs,
and they're throwing them in the Dniester, a river in the Ukraine.
Then later, of course,
the stories were getting worse,
and we began to hear about mass shootings and mass graves,
But there was a sort of a naive…
I hate to use the word, but I have to use the word…
patriotic feeling that we Hungarians don't do such things.
Hitler was in Germany, so what happened in Germany didn't reflect on us.
I mean, we were far away from it.
[Randolph Braham] There were two wars.
There was a military war,
and hand-in-hand with that war.
There was a second war,
the war of the SS directed against the Jews.
The dark side of the Hungarian national character
was becoming more and more obvious.
The persecution of Jews became more and more obvious.
Jews were losing their jobs, their businesses.
There was a Hungarian Nazi movement, the Arrow Cross,
and this became, of course,
the most hated and the most feared group for Hungarian Jews.
[Renee Firestone] People wonder, "How is it that we didn't do something?"
We didn't run away. We didn't hide.
Well, things didn't happen at once.
Things happened very slowly,
so each time a new law came out, or a restriction,
we said, "Well, just another thing. It'll blow over."
[Tom Lantos] Hitler moved into Hungary on the 19th of March, 1944.
I was 16 years old.
1944, March 19th.
Germans entered, the SS entered, our town.
Two motorcycles was the whole Nazi regime that occupied our town
because they were there with the people that lived there the whole time and did their dirty.
Most of them were people we thought were our friends all these years,
but they turned overnight on us
and went with the other side.
And the next restriction was
that the Jew cannot walk out on the street without the yellow star.
We heard that in Germany they to wear the yellow star
before they were taken away,
and in Poland, they did that.
So at that point we were worried.
[Tom Lantos] I did not wear a yellow star
and I was caught.
I was put into a forced-labor camp
in a place north of Budapest,
which had an important railroad bridge.
And our job was to repair the railroads,
the lines, the bridges, non-stop,
while the British and the Americans were bombing day and night.
We were obviously worried that we would die.
But we were also hoping
that the American and British bombers will hit all of their targets
and destroy this bridge
because that was the way to defeat Hitler.
I escaped from that labor camp,
and I joined the Hungarian underground.
And the next decree would be that we have to pack up 25 kilos.
And at first, we didn't understand. What do you take?
Think about your home, your own home.
What would you take, 25 kilos?
What is 25 kilos?
How much is 25 kilos?
Do you take the pillows? Your covers?
Do you take your dishes? Do you take…
What do you take?
When we were packing,
I wanted to take something that would remind me of the good times.
I was very depressed and worried.
And so I came across a bathing suit.
A bathing suit that my father brought me.
I don't want to do this.
On one of his business trips, about three years earlier,
my father came home.
And, um… he always brought us something,
my sister and myself.
And, uh…
of course, we always asked, "What did you bring?"
And he opened this box,
and out of the box came this most beautiful bathing suit.
It had a shiny satin finish
It had a shiny satin finish and a print of multicolored flowers.
and a print of multicolored flowers.
And then in the afternoon, when I heard the soldiers' boots coming up the stairs,
I ran back, and I put this bathing suit under my dress.
And that's how I left.
They broke down the front doors. They came in. They gave us a few minutes.
They said a half hour, but it was not a half hour,
to get it all our valuables together,
and they… They marched us out of the house.
I couldn't imagine that they just take out people from their homes…
because they're Jewish.
Our friends, so-called, and neighbors,
they were standing lined up alongside of the road,
and they were yelling,
"It's about time, you go on out of here. And we don't need any Jews in our town."
"We need to get rid of all you Jews."
I stood, and I could not believe my eyes.
[hesitates] The people I went to school with their children. We were friends.
We were sharing things together.
Why are they so hostile? Why do they hate us all of a sudden?
It's like when you read that the Jews went out of Egypt.
We are carrying all our baggage.
The pillows and the covers are tied to them, bundled.
And we children helped to carry. And I'm so ashamed.
[Renee Firestone] We wanted to believe they're gonna take us to Germany. And we're gonna work. We really wanted to believe it.
And we're gonna work. We really wanted to believe it.
And by then, the whole European Jewry was already in camps,
which we didn't know.
The concentration, ghettoization and deportation
took place in a concentrated manner that is within 12 weeks.
And nowhere else was the deportation program carried out
with the barbarity and speed that it was in Hungary.
They say that they will take us to a ghetto,
and we'd never heard that word.
It is not a Hungarian word, "ghetto."
[Renee Firestone] We had no idea where we were.
In the morning, when we woke up,
I realized that we are in a brickyard.
Brick factory yard.
And in April, it was rainy. It was a lot of rain.
And we were always…
And we were always… We had to change the sheet because the roof was the sheet,
We had to change the sheet because the roof was the sheet,
and we were always wet.
There were thousands of people there because they came from the whole county.
And there were guards everywhere, with dogs,
walking around all the time, big German Shepherd dogs,
on very, very tight leashes.
…because this was all these huts, with people, people all over the place.
[Robin] Do you know where your hut was? [Irene Zisblatt] Yes. My hut was right here, where these piles of bricks are.
[Irene Zisblatt] Yes. My hut was right here, where these piles of bricks are.
[sniffles] And then one day they announced
that everybody that wants to go to work to Tokay
on the vineyard to make wine should come here,
and everybody voluntary, gladly went on the train
because this was hell.
And going to work in a vineyard was like going to heaven from this.
We were taken to the railroad station by the Hungarian soldiers.
My mother said to me,
"I rolled up diamonds in your skirt, in the hem of your skirt."
"And if you don't have enough to eat, those are to buy bread."
When we arrived at the railroad station,
we realized that we're not going on passenger trains.
The cattle cars were waiting for us.
[Irene Zisblatt] My father said, "They ran out of other trains because it's wartime."
"They don't have the other train. So, they have to use what they have."
[Alice Lok Cahana] Anybody who didn't go and didn't go fast was beaten.
When they closed the doors, then I heard that knock on the outside
like a bolt closing us in there.
It wasn't normal anymore. It wasn't…
I didn't accept that they were running out of the other trains.
[Bill Basch] In Budapest, this time started getting worse.
I really had to acquire Gentile papers.
I did not exist as a Jew.
I would have been shot. I would have been killed.
You were a hunted animal, 24 hours, every day,
and you didn't know if anybody you encountered
was really on your side.
Had it not been for Wallenberg,
neither I nor the other tens of thousands would have ever survived.
Raoul Wallenberg arrived when all of Hungary,
with the exception of Budapest, was already free of Jews.
He went to Budapest at a time when, in the countryside,
the Jews had already been put into cattle cars
and shipped away from Hungary.
And he decided to join the Swedish embassy there
for the sole purpose of trying to save Jewish lives.
By issuing so-called Swedish protective passports,
he declared that the individual who had this document
at the end of the war planned to go to Sweden.
This was pure fiction, but in the chaos and the confusion of the war,
this miraculous, worthless piece of paper worked.
[Bill Basch] Several of us acted as distributors or runners
to deliver this fake passport
to the people that were waiting in those protected houses.
[Tom Lantos] Wallenberg leased large apartment houses,
put up a Swedish sign indicating that all the residents
were under the protection of the royal Swedish government.
I stayed at St. Stephen Park, number 25.
Most of these houses were upper-middle-class apartment houses,
and a three-bedroom apartment,
that may have had four, five, six people living there before this crisis,
suddenly became a hovel
with 60, 70 people jammed into a three-bedroom apartment.
[girl 1] Very uncomfortable.
It was very uncomfortable, honey,
but more importantly, it was unbelievably dangerous.
The word "protected house" obviously is a misnomer,
uh, because many of the people living in these quote-unquote "protected houses"
were rounded up, taken to the bank of the Danube, and killed.
Now, to get into the protected houses was not difficult.
Soldiers didn't care.
They were out in the front. "Go in there."
However, to come out
that was the very, very difficult thing.
If German soldiers or Hungarian Nazi soldiers were suspicious,
they ordered us to take down our pants
because we were the only people who were circumcised.
One day, I had on my body, strapped around, the fake passports,
which I was delivering to these people so they could get out of the building,
and I miscalculated.
I went through the sewer line, and I knew when to get out.
And I made a mistake,
instead of coming out in the middle of the building,
I came out in front of the building,
where two soldiers were guarding the building.
I started running as fast as I could,
crossing the street back and forth.
And they were deporting a group of Jews,
not knowing where they're taking them,
I jumped into that group of Jews thinking,
"As I got in so many times into trouble, I'll get out one more time."
"Just one more escape."
We would up five days later in Buchenwald.
[Irene Zisblatt] We were on the train for about five days.
Sitting on a heap of luggage that we carried there.
The cattle car that I was in, there was about 120 of us.
Mashed together like sardines, and it's very, very hot.
They had one pail, you know, for going to the bathroom.
And suddenly the buckets filled up, and then the odor was unbearable.
They never opened the doors to go to the bathroom.
They never gave us any water. They never gave us any food.
The children were screaming. They wanted to go home.
"Where are they taking us? Where are they taking us?"
Nobody answered.
It was total darkness.
The light seeped only through the cracks of the cattle car.
[Irene Zisblatt] My father found a crack in the cattle train.
He looked out, and he spoke out loud,
"I don't think we're going to the vineyard
because we just crossed the border, and we're heading towards Poland."
When he said Poland, I remembered the man telling the story about the children,
what they're doing to the children in Poland.
And I was holding my little brother. He was two-and-a-half years old.
I was holding him so tight.
And I said to him, I said to myself,
"I will never let him go. They will never take him from me."
When they opened the door suddenly…
and suddenly the light hit you.
And because you had your eyes for four, five days shut,
or used to this darkness,
you're almost blinded.
We were so happy because we were going to get air.
We were gonna get off, go to the bathroom like normal people,
and have water and maybe some food.
And everybody would ask, "Where are we? What's the name?"
And it was very strange name.
Auschwitz.
[Alice Lok Cahana] Here, we had to be stopped.
Here was… A lot of selection happened.
-You're all standing in a line-- -Thousands of people,
close to each other,
and confusion and noise.
And then… Don't move, and don't… [snaps fingers]
Like soldiers standing straight, you see?
And in the middle would the SS go here,
to check all of us.
Walking the dogs and just threatening.
-Single file, or people standing next to… -Five.
[Michael] Five in a row.
[Alice Lok Cahana] So it was easy to count, right.
[Renee Firestone] When I jumped off the cattle car,
I knew right away that whatever they promised us,
whatever they told us, were lies.
And you see a lot of people running in striped clothes and shaved heads.
Surrounded by Nazi soldiers and vicious dogs.
And they were yelling, and they were screaming.
"Hurry up! Leave all your luggage there. Just leave everything."
All of a sudden, there was a separation,
and my mother and my…
my mother and… [exhales]
and my brother and my sister…
She held my little brother in her arms, in one arm,
and my four-and-a-half-year-old sister in her hand. I was holding onto her hand.
This is how we were walking towards…
They were pushing us towards that destination.
[in German] When the transports came in,
the people were sorted.
It was a very basic process, a very simple one.
The people had to stand in a long line.
At the front of the line were some medical officers who would say,
"This one’s too old, over 50."
"This one goes to the right. The other goes left."
[Renee Firestone] My mother was selected at the railroad station,
going to the left while my sister and I went to the right.
My mother was taken
straight from the railroad station to the gas chambers.
By the time my sister and I were processed into the camp,
my mother was no longer alive.
[Renee Firestone] We were taken to a dressing room.
We were told we're gonna be taking a shower after this…
after this horrendous journey,
and we are going to refresh ourselves,
and then we will be assigned to our work.
[Irene Zisblatt] They ordered us to take our shoes in one hand and our clothes in the other.
And I remembered the diamonds.
And I grabbed my blue skirt, and in the crowd, you know,
I just fast took out the diamonds and held them in my hands,
and I had no clothes on my body.
And I remember I got undressed with the rest of them,
and there I was in the bathing suit, standing in the bathing suit.
I had a premonition.
I had this feeling that if I take this bathing suit off,
if I leave this bathing suit behind,
all the wonderful memories that were built in this bathing suit…
I kept remembering how I walked around the swimming pool,
and how the boys were whistling at me, and my friends were so jealous.
And now I'm going to take it off, and I'm going to leave it here.
Everything that meant anything in life to me, I'm going to leave behind.
[Irene] They kept on saying
if anybody has any valuables left, to leave them.
They had a section for that. [sniffles]
I held onto the diamonds for dear life because that was to buy bread.
So I put them in my mouth.
And then when I walked up again,
I saw they were opening people's mouths, and they were looking in,
but I was in the… I was, like, at the at the road of no return.
I couldn't give 'em up any more because I would be shot.
Why didn't I leave 'em back there?
And I had them in my mouth,
and I didn't know what to do, so I swallowed them.
We walked into the shower room,
and the dressing room was locked behind us,
and a commando came in and removed all our belongings right away.
They did give us a shower, a little, trinkly shower, and then they…
Again, there was a door on the other side
leading out to the courtyard on the other side of this building.
And at the door, they had a pile of clothes.
And they ordered everybody to pick one piece of clothing.
We waited till about midnight,
then they permitted us to walk into one of these wooden barracks.
[Alice Lok Cahana] A thousand people in a barrack.
If one person turned, everybody had to turn
because we were so close to each other.
I used to wake up so cold,
and I…
used to have returning dreams
that I'm at home,
that I'm very cold,
but my father will come and comfort me, so…
And then, you wake up.
From a whistle.
It's dark outside.
And this is a madman's hell.
[Renee Firestone] We saw this group of about 20 men coming through the camp,
and as they were marching by, I was watching.
Maybe I know somebody.
And suddenly, I recognize my father.
And my first thought was to hide.
It was terribly painful seeing him
with his shaved head and his uniform, like a prisoner.
This man who was helping everybody,
who was the kindest human being.
I just couldn't imagine how would he feel if he saw us
with the shaved heads and in this rag.
So I really just wanted to hide so he can't see me.
And at that moment, our eyes locked.
And I could see his tears rolling down his cheek.
That was the last time I saw my father.
[Irene Zisblatt] I saw trucks coming
and screams in the trucks.
And I saw two children fall out of the truck.
[Irene] And the truck stopped,
[Irene Zisblatt] And the trucks [hesitates]…
And one SS man came out from the front,
and he picked up the children… [sniffs] …like that.
And he banged him against the truck,
and the blood came running down, and threw him into the truck, so…
That's when I stopped talking to God.
They told us that we're gonna get a number.
Prisoner's number.
Well, of course, we expected to get a prisoner's number
on our clothing or somewhere.
And they set up these tables.
And at each table sat a few guards
with huge books open in front of them.
And we presumed that they are going to put our name in it,
and the number that they're going to give us.
And then we realized that they are putting this number
on our flesh,
on our arms.
They took five of us and put drops in our eyes.
We didn't know why. They didn't tell us. And they put us in the dungeon.
They closed us in there,
and we were standing in water up to our ankles, tightly packed,
and it seemed like forever.
It seemed like it was an eternity. They never opened the door.
They never gave us anything to eat or drink.
So, we drank the water we stood in.
We went to the bathroom in the water we stood in.
And then they opened the door, and they took us out.
And they brought us up into the courtyard,
and they examined our eyes.
And some of the people couldn't see for several days after that.
And they took us back to the barrack.
And then we found out later what they were doing.
They were trying to change the color of our eyes.
[in German] For those who wanted to conduct experiments on humans,
this was a useful workplace.
Many experiments were done in Auschwitz to find ways to sterilize women,
specifically Jewish women, in order to diminish the race
without going through too much trouble.
These women were then sent back to the camp.
Sometimes they were immediately transferred
because they were so-called "secret bearers."
They performed tests, then sent them back to Birkenau and gassed them.
One day, a prisoner acquaintance came to me and asked me
if I could try to gain some influence…
if anything could be done, not to send them to the gas chamber.
The only way to do that was to make them undergo more tests.
To save them, we had to keep conducting harmless tests on them.
This is what we planned to do, and somehow it worked.
And that is why I was acquitted…
in Auschwitz.
[Randolph] Having survived the first four and a half years of the war,
the Hungarian Jews were killed in the last chapter
of Hitler's war against the Jews when the leaders of the world
were already fully aware of all the details of Auschwitz.
When we came to Auschwitz,
it was during the Final Solution,
when he just was desperate already.
He was losing the war. Hitler was losing the war,
but he was not going to lose the war against the Jews.
The sadism, the cruelty,
the irrationality of the German and Hungarian Nazis,
of killing the remaining Jewish population when the war was all over,
when they could have gained brownie points
by being more civilized vis-à-vis these people,
was really not present because their hatred was so blind.
[Randolph Braham] The Nazis diverted trains and other transportation means
useful to the Germans
for purposes of deporting Jews,
to complete the Final Solution program.
While I was in Auschwitz,
the transports were coming in two, three transports a day,
with thousands of people in it.
[Randolph Braham] Within less than six weeks,
more than 438,000 Hungarian Jews
were deported to Auschwitz.
The gas chambers, the crematoria, could not cope.
The SS had to dig special pits
to burn the bodies,
using the Jews' own fat as fuel.
I saw how they were throwing people into these fire pits.
And I said to myself, "Something is wrong with me. My mind is going."
I couldn't be seeing this.
[in German] The mass graves were
about eight by ten or ten by ten meters wide.
Wood was piled on the bottom and set on fire.
Then the bodies were thrown over the fire. That was it.
If the fat burned, then the grave was working.
Then more and more bodies were thrown into it.
That simple.
[Alice Lok Cahana] What vast landscape you are seeing here.
How could people, normal people, go back
after working here,
or planned this, okay?
Somebody had to plan it.
Somebody had to be an engineer.
Somebody had to really put on a map, this kind of efficiency.
But the whole time I was in the camp, through the experiment,
every time I was selected, I swallowed the diamonds.
So, every time I swallowed them, I had to find them again.
We were allowed to go to the latrine once a day,
and I never sat on the hole because I had to go and find my diamonds.
And when the SS woman walked by the door, and she saw me in the corner…
I already had the diamonds in hand. Usually I was waiting until…
On the way back, I would rinse them off, like in the mud,
or if there was no mud,
in the soup that we were going to get next, but I had no time, and I had to swallow them.
My God, this is the latrine.
Oh my God.
At this place, I was with my sister,
with Edith next to me.
And so Edith whispers to me and says,
"It's almost Shabbat. It's Friday. It's almost Shabbat."
How we used to celebrate Shabbat in our house,
with food and with singing and with praying
and, you know, lighting the candle.
And I told her, "Why don't we celebrate inside, in the latrine?"
We ran back to the end, and we started to make our Shabbat ceremony,
and we started to sing.
And as we sang the melody,
other children came around us and started to sing with us.
Somebody was from Holland. Somebody was from Germany.
Somebody was from Hungary, Czechoslovakia. All thrown together.
And suddenly, the Hebrew songs, the prayers, the Shabbat,
united us in the latrine of Auschwitz.
[Irene Zisblatt] People couldn't endure all this pain,
the conditions and the hunger and the lice.
The lice were, like, as big as my pinky nail,
embedded into our bodies.
And we were sore from scratching and infections.
And so, when the electricity went on,
they ran to the barbed wire to commit suicide.
Then they punished us. For every man that ran to the wire,
they took 100 inmates,
and they killed them in front of everybody as an example.
They didn't even let us die when we wanted.
And then I thought of something.
They took away my parents.
They took away my identity. They took away my siblings.
They took away my possessions.
There is something that they want from me.
And then I thought of my soul.
And I said, "They're not gonna take my soul."
And I decided right then and there,
"I'm going to get up from this mud, and I'm going to fight
because I'm not going to become ashes."
[Renee Firestone] When we arrived to Auschwitz,
thousands and thousands of people were cremated every day.
The Nazis used Jewish inmates,
a special Sonderkommando,
to remove the bodies from the gas chambers
and take the bodies into the crematoria.
As far as I know, there is only four of us
that worked in the Sonderkommando alive today.
And we are the only eyewitness
that saw the whole thing from A to Z.
How the Final Solution was done.
I'm Jewish, from Greece.
And I lived in Greece until the time they took me to concentration camp.
The first week of April 1944,
I arrived in Auschwitz.
They selected some of the Greeks to go to work in crematorium.
Now is my first day there.
I don't know what was going on.
I saw 2,500 people, all naked,
go into the big chamber, which eventually…
They take only 500 people. They were putting in 2,500 people.
So nobody could do anything but stand by their children.
And 15 minutes later, you know, after they close the chambers,
and the SS threw the gas from these four openings,
you know, they open up.
What did I see? I see the people I saw 15 minutes ago.
I see them all dead, standing up, with their children black and blue.
And I said to myself, "What's going on? What's going on here?"
There was a Polish guy that was there before,
and I said, "Where is God?"
He said, "God, God is where you have your strength."
There were four crematoriums, you know, and they were working 24 hours.
And there were a lot of big shots from Berlin
coming and watching how the Jews were dying.
You know, there was a hole, in the, you know, hermetically closed,
and they were looking there how the Jewish people were dying.
Takes two to four minutes. Depends where you are.
A lot of people think that we, working in the Sonderkommando,
we were guilty of something because we were doing such kind of work.
But ourselves, you know, we couldn't get out of it.
If you don't do whatever they ask you to do, they kill you right away.
One time I had two friends of mine, very close friends of mine.
They came in, you know. Their names were the Venezias.
And… [clear throat] …I told them right away
that they were going to die.
And they asked for food, and whatever I had, I gave them to eat,
and I told them exactly where to keep themselves,
where the openings were, so they can die fast.
And after they were through, I took them out, and I washed them,
and I put them in the oven to be burned.
[Tom Lantos] We could hear the artillery moving closer and closer.
And Budapest was the battlefield
between the Germans and the Soviet Army.
And although we knew it would be weeks
before the Soviet Army would hopefully liberate the remaining Jews,
we knew that lots of hardships were still ahead.
[Alice Lok Cahana] In Auschwitz, after Christmas,
we heard more and more the bombing came closer and closer.
The Nazis didn't want anybody to get liberated,
so they were herding the people away from the camp.
[Randolph Braham] The death march was in winter.
Those who could not keep pace were simply shot by the wayside.
If anybody, anybody tries to run away
or do anything that is not permitted, will be shot on the spot.
There were three of us friends that were together up to that point.
But we swore that we would sacrifice each other's life for each other.
We would never let each other down.
Kids. You know, we had this sort of a dream that will be possible.
One of the three had an injury in his knee and had gangrene,
and one of the soldiers noticed him limping.
So, he comes up, and he wants to shoot him.
We step in front of him. He pulls out his Luger and says,
"I'll give you till three seconds. Count to three."
"Either you let him go, or all the three of you die."
Can you imagine, even so young, the decision that we had to make?
Here, we promised that we will die for each other,
but we couldn't keep that promise under threat of death.
We did let him die.
We arrived… About ten days' march or so, we arrived into Dachau.
[Bill Basch] Oh my God.
After 53 years…
it's as if it were yesterday.
You could find them here on the street, just laying,
and you didn't pay attention. You stepped over bodies.
You didn't pay any attention. It didn't mean anything.
-[Martin] Right here? -Yeah.
I never knew anybody's name.
Never wanted to know anybody.
I never wanted to know, just in case someday
someone will know this person
whose shoes I have taken off when he died.
If you can imagine that every morning, my job was for a while…
I had to go barrack to barrack to barrack
and take those bodies and bring them to the crematorium.
We had one of those push cars.
I remember the Sonderkommandos that worked in the crematorium
came out, and they opened the gate.
They took it over from here and walked it in, but we were never allowed to cross this.
They never talked about the crematorium, but we knew.
If we walked in here, we never got out.
You never got out from here, from this area.
Because, I mean, if they let him out, and he escapes,
they have witness, they have testimony. So they wouldn't let them out.
Look at that.
The inhumanity of man against man…
is beyond belief.
This is…
the most monstrous thing that man devised.
Burning human beings just, just to get rid of them quicker.
Unbelievable.
Just so emotional. It's so hard.
Now, why did I survive?
Why did God spare me?
Somebody started to yell, "Americans! Americans!"
And we didn't know what they mean by Americans. And they were pointing up to the sky.
Planes came out from behind the mountains, from nowhere,
and they just bombed the convoy.
And they they didn't touch us. None of us got hurt.
That's when I found out the first time that the United States was at war.
It was April 29th when I was ordered to go to Dachau.
Actually, the night of the 28th.
And we were ordered to take off as fast as possible to get to Dachau,
not knowing what we were facing.
We thought it was a military camp,
a German military camp that we were going in to take,
and therefore we were gonna capture it and capture the people inside.
We were in the vicinity
of what we found out to be concentration camps.
[Bill Basch] Suddenly, we hear machine guns shooting up.
First thought was that we are being killed.
Then we saw American soldiers climbing, crawling and shooting.
Then we saw German soldiers coming from that direction.
And as they met up here in the center, that Germans gave up.
But visualize 32,000 people coming out of all those barracks.
Outside the camp…
on the railroad tracks was…
40 boxcars, I believe was the count.
Absolutely full of dead bodies.
And not having had any knowledge of what we were facing,
this was…
totally unreal.
Most of them wearing flannel pajamas. That's all what they had.
Blue stripe, white stripe.
Flannel pajamas. People were weak.
Weak probably isn't even the right term.
But they were emaciated.
Some looked very old, but they weren't.
[Katsugo Miho] They were walking dead, is what we called them. Skeletons.
[Paul Parks] A few came out first,
then more came out, and more came out, and they kept coming toward us
because it was almost as if they realized…
I guess they did. They realized that we were different.
That we were people coming to help them.
And Americans held the gun against the Germans,
but they didn't kill them. They let us have them.
And taking a dozen or so German soldiers that we caught,
literally tore them apart, piece by piece.
We captured a German colonel.
And I went back and told him
that we're going to send you back to the officers to talk to you.
And he spit in my face.
Then I killed him.
It wasn't long before the war was over after that.
But by those last days,
we intended to stop Germany from ever having the opportunity
to stand up again and do this to anybody.
I've seen many a horrible sight
in that two years of… In Italy, France and Germany,
but the worst thing I've ever seen in my life
were the survivors of the Holocaust.
This is something which is…
To this day, I cannot forget.
I wasn't young anymore.
I was very old.
I was 16, but I was very old.
Returning to freedom was very difficult.
We didn't know how we're going to make peace with the outside world,
which didn't want us.
And we didn't know…
who we're going to find or not find.
They didn't know what to do with us. And they put us in a DP camp,
which is a displaced persons camp.
And the closest one from where I was, was in Austria.
And all the survivors that had no other place to go were in that camp.
So it was another camp, but it was free.
After the Soviet Army liberated Budapest,
and I became a free human being again,
I did not know for months
whether my mother or other members of my family would ever return.
[Renee Firestone] I was hoping that going back to Auschwitz is finally going to give me some closure.
And, uh, I was shocked to find out
that it opened up new questions and new doubts.
I would like to find out about my family.
[in Polish] She'd like to look for information about her and her family.
Your name, please?
Renee. R-e-n-e-e.
[Renee Firestone] This is the first time that I decided…
to find some records of my family.
And my sister was Klara.
[translator in Polish] You found something?
Yes, I found something. We can look together.
[in Polish] Please lay the cards down like this.
-Klara. -Klara. My sister.
I found records of my sister, my father, and my own,
and when I asked about my mother…
uh, the archivist, the historian, told me
that those who were taken from the railroad station
and killed immediately,
there is no record of those.
[in Polish] Take this upstairs to the archive and ring the bell, okay?
[in Polish] Thank you.
This is a test of blood or, uh, or something medical.
Subject of Klara Weinfeld.
I found out that my sister was experimented on,
that they were doing some blood tests on her.
And what does this here all mean?
And he said, "I really don't know."
He says, "Nobody ever asked me."
But there is a Dr. Münch, who was the head of this clinic,
who's still alive."
And then I found out that you're going to interview this man,
and that I may have a chance to ask him what those symbols meant.
[in German] My sister Klara died in Auschwitz… Yeah.
And I recently obtained these papers from Auschwitz.
-I would like you to explain these papers. -I will try.
Can you tell me what this is?
[Hans Münch in English] No, nothing important, no.
What kind of experiments were these?
[in German] It's nothing. Everything is good.
-Why did she die? -"Clinical Institute."
-That's my institute. -Yeah.
-[Hans Münch] She did die. -[Renee] Yeah.
When did she arrive? How long did she stay?
[in English] Six months.
-Six months. -Six months? Yeah, six months.
-[in German] And then she died. -Yeah.
Well, that is the normal period. Do you understand?
You were in Auschwitz as well? Well then, you should know.
[Renee Firestone in English] I tried to be civilized,
but he was very evasive,
and I became very angry.
I kept thinking that thousands and thousands of people died in his clinic.
I am going to go back to Crematorium V
because I know that my mother was taken there for sure.
I'm going to light some candles.
And I know that I am not coming back here anymore.
And now…
just very recently,
I got a new letter from Bergen-Belsen
that they don't have Edith Lok. They looked through their books.
But they found an Edith Schwarz.
And I remembered at one point,
my sister Edith decided
that she will use my mother's name, but I forgot it.
And all these years, I looked for Edith Lok.
-Can you find me, though, with Hungarian-- -Hungarian?
Let's just find it. Okay.
-It's not alphabetized. -Yeah?
[Alice Lok Cahana] Going back to Bergen-Belsen,
I want my husband to say a prayer with my children and with me
because we will symbolically bury Edith.
This is the cemetery where all the people were buried
who were brought after liberation to the military blocks.
We found the name of your sister.
She died here.
We think at the 2nd of June, 1945.
So, all the people who died in those days were buried here, one beside the next one.
[Alice Lok Cahana] Today is the most special day of my life.
Finally, the search is over.
And we now know what happened, and when it happened.
I brought here my mother's prayer book,
and here we will say for you
the prayers that's traditional
and light this candle in your memory.
And remember… [clears throat]… you…
forever…
as long as we live.
[Alice Lok Cahana] But there are a lot of people like me out there,
who are still looking.
Because for us…
liberation was not the last day.
[Tom Lantos] I got an announcement that I'd been selected
to receive an academic scholarship
to the University of Washington, in a town called "Seattle,"
because nobody told me it's supposed to be pronounced "Seattle."
I had a ticket on the SS Marine Falcon.
I went to bunk B-20, put down my knapsack, and they called for chow.
I had no idea what chow was. It wasn't part of my English vocabulary.
So, I got into the chow line.
We had these huge metal trays, and this was a period
when, of course, my mental preoccupation was still with hunger.
And these wonderful people slopped on wonderful things on this metal tray.
And at the end of the line,
there was a huge wicker basket of oranges.
A huge wicker basket of bananas.
My mother always taught me to do the right thing. And I didn't know what right was. So there was another huge sailor,
And I didn't know what right was. So there was another huge sailor,
and I asked him, "Sir, do I take a banana?"
"Or do I take an orange?"
And he said, "You eat all the damn bananas and all the damn oranges you want."
And then I knew I was in heaven.
[Irene Zisblatt] I loved my town, and I see it picturesque and happy.
I'm planning to go there for the first time since I left in 1944.
Look at the sign, Robin. It says "Polyana" in Russian.
You see?
The river is running on the right.
We used to go bathing here…
I'm hoping that I can find some of the people that I knew
before the Holocaust…
and maybe that I can talk to them.
-Mushrooms in the jar. See? -Yes.
[Irene in English] Maybe they can tell me things that happened while we were away.
[Irene] This one woman, Mariska, she remembered my grandparents
and my father and my mother and me.
I was most surprised that she remembered me.
I was really afraid that the people were going to be hostile to me,
that they were going to be accusing me of coming back to take something from them.
I was asked in a very nice way,
"Am I planning to take my property and come back to live there?"
And I said no.
I just want my children to know where I come from,
and I wanted to see my town where I grew up once more before I die.
[Renee Firestone] Going back to my hometown
with my family, with my child,
showing her this beautiful town, which…
Everywhere we went, the word "Jew" doesn't exist.
This building was the Jewish community center.
I wanted to go to the Jewish temple, which was a beautiful synagogue.
Look, look, look how they let this…
Oh my God.
What they did to this city, you just have no idea.
It's just unbelievable.
We went to the temple,
and there I met this man, this Jewish man.
He was also in Auschwitz.
[in Hungarian] Hello, do you speak Hungarian?
[Renee] Good morning. Are you from here?
I was born here in 1928.
[Renee] I'm from the Weinfeld family.
Weinfeld?
[Renee] My father had a shop on Cobbler's Lane.
And of course, my mother attended this temple.
I had my Bar Mitzvah here when I turned 13, in 1941.
And why did you stay here?
Because I came back from Auschwitz
on June 6, 1945.
And a few days later, the borders were closed.
[Renee in English] Then he walked us through the temple, and he explained to us
that this is no longer a Jewish temple.
[man in Hungarian] In the old days, there were Stars of David here.
[Renee] What did they do with them?
[man] They made it into a concert hall.
They removed everything.
[Renee Firestone in English] It was very painful to see
that this holy place was transformed into a place of entertainment.
The most difficult part was going back to my house.
Oh my God!
That's the… the original… That's the original gate.
-The entrance. -The entrance, yeah.
It was neglected.
This beautiful house that my father took care of always.
And everything was manicured around it.
-[Bernard] I think that's locked. -[Renee] No.
No, it isn't.
-It just doesn't open. -[Klara] Can we go?
[Renee] It doesn't open.
At that moment, I really wished I wouldn't  have seen it.
One of the neighbors
who was a young child at the time they took us away was still there.
Thank God that you are still alive.
I'm telling you, I can still remember everything as it used to be.
[Renee in English] He has now a Russian wife
who was very sympathetic.
[in Hungarian] Your own house…
To take someone's house, how could that be?
There would be a lot to tell, but you know what they say…
Even the walls have ears.
[Renee in English] She was scared to tell me what really happened after we left.
[in Hungarian] Tell me, after we were taken, did you talk about it?
We were so sorry for Klara. We heard she died on the way.
No. She died there.
Poor thing.
I have only seen it in the movies.
Did they really burn people like that?
Unfortunately, it was much worse than what they show in the movies.
[Renee in English] At that moment, I felt very lucky,
that I would have a chance to go back to the United States, to my home.
I saved the diamonds all the way, through the whole… everything.
And when I was free, I, uh, didn't talk about the Holocaust,
but I took the diamonds, and I mounted them into a teardrop-shaped pendant,
because every time I had to save them, I had to cry so much.
So, I felt that the tears are appropriate for that.
And I told my children that these diamonds should go down
from generation to generation,
to the first-born girl in the family, until forever.
…what it tastes like. [chuckles]
And you can see their different shapes and different cuts.
And they're the only thing that I…
…that I'm holding that my mother ever held.
Okay, well. I don't know what you think about…
My life today is something I myself cannot believe.
Having been elected by my constituents in California of some 600,000 people,
nine times,
it all seems like a dream.
And it all places
an incredible sense of responsibility on me…
As the only survivor of the Holocaust
ever elected to the Congress of the United States,
I know I speak for all of my colleagues,
Republicans and Democrats,
in expressing our outrage at the most recent terrorist attacks…
The central focus of my life, obviously, is human rights
because I am convinced that this is really the path
of a more civilized world.
My wife Annette and I have known each other all our lives.
We grew up as children in Budapest.
And we have been married now for 47 years.
We have two daughters
who early on came to us and said
that, uh… they plan a special gift for their parents.
[Tom] Since our families were wiped out, they will give us a large family.
And we have been blessed with 17 wonderful grandchildren,
and it's really the focus of our life.
[Renee Firestone] I would like to be known as an educator on the Holocaust.
So I go to the Museum of Tolerance,
where I was the founder of the outreach program.
And I speak to groups who come into the Museum.
…came into being.
You know, when these things are happening,
you almost begin to believe that you did something wrong.
Why would they do this to me?
I feel that it is my duty
to make the world aware of what happened during that time.
I always felt that my language is inadequate.
And that if I wanted to tell the story about my experiences,
I have to talk through a medium.
And I found art
because art transcends.
It's beyond words.
I wanted the surface to be very much layered.
It should look like a crumbled wall,
like it's papered over with yesterday's news
because people want to forget the past.
People want to forget about the Holocaust.
What keeps me going is really…
the family…
that my husband and I created.
My grandchildren.
Three wonderful children.
Two of them rabbis.
And my beautiful daughter.
She teaches me every day what is important in life.
And my husband, who is four generations Israeli.
And such a gallant man.
And he helped me to construct a life.
This painting is Arbeit Macht Frei.
When you read this welcome gate,
so to speak, Arbeit macht frei…
My art today is about the Holocaust
because I have no memorial for my people.
I… don't know where they are.
Why so many of my family members died, so many got killed.
The Basch family was almost wiped out.
We have regenerated.
So when we get together, we are quite a large group.
And the joy sitting with my family
and looking around and saying that I was so close to death.
And here I am sitting at a table, and there are 11, 12 of us,
rejoicing life.
The pleasure of living is wonderful.
One day, it was on a Sunday, someone knocked at my door
and walked into…
And I went to the door.
And they had something wrapped up in a newspaper under the arm.
He said, "You Paul Parks?" I said, "Yes."
He said, "We've been looking for you for several years."
"Off-and-on, people have been looking."
"We wanted to find you." I said, "Why?"
He said, "There was a fellow liberated by you guys at Dachau who remembered you."
"And he died several years ago."
"And he'd made a menorah in the camp."
"He made it out of concrete nails
and welded it and braided it together while he was in the camp."
"And he wants you to… He wanted you to have it."
"So we've been looking to give it to you. Here it is."
And he gave me this beautiful menorah.
[Irene Zisblatt] Liberation was like a present from the world.
And that's the first time I acknowledged God again,
that He is around, and He helped me to get to this point.
I don't think that God created the Holocaust.
I think that God gave us a mind and a heart and a free will.
And it is up to man…
what he's going to do with his life.
And I blame man, not God.
I cannot rationally explain…
emotionally explain, intellectually explain the Holocaust.
I cannot… I cannot find…
a place for…
a higher authority
in this nightmare.
What kind of people are we?
What are the books teaching us?
What is the difference between me…
and another child?
What is the Bible teaching me?
What… What is this about?
[Randolph Braham] Hitler remained a pathological anti-Semite to the end.
And one of his last testaments,
or warnings to his followers,
was for them to continue the war against the Jews.
In his will executed April 29, 1945,
he says, "Above all,
I enjoin the government and the people
to uphold the race laws to the limit,
and to resist mercilessly
the poisoner of all nations,
international Jewry."
[Randolph Braham] The Holocaust has to be thought as a chapter
in the long history of man's inhumanity to man.
One cannot ignore
the discrimination
inflicted on many people
because of race, color, or creed.
One cannot ignore slavery.
One cannot ignore the burning of witches.
One cannot ignore the killing of Christians in the Roman period.
The Holocaust perhaps is the culmination
of the kind of horror that can occur
Believe that!
-Ladies, we got picture. -What about the alarm?
Miles, what do you think I'm doing?
Just cool out. We like to run a loose crew around here.
You're the boss, Miles.
It's like that?
It's like that.
I'm gonna go check on Tulley.
Tulley, we cool down there?
Yeah, we're cool, man.
Good.
Cool is good.
Are you smoking?
No. Negative.
You're lying! I smell the menthol up here, man!
What would your mama do if she knew you were smoking?
Cut it out, man!
Stay alert.
You ready over here?
Damn it! Eddie, why you gotta do that every time?
-It's good luck. -It's bad luck if I land in it. Believe that.
Don't fall in that shit.
See you, Deke.
Good luck, guys.
How's the weather up there?
Snowing.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
You got a guard 20 feet from you.
Ten feet. He's closing in fast.
Around the corner.
He turned around.
Forget it. He's gone.
So much for the easy part. Kit.
-Shit! -Bam!
I hate it when you do that.
Eddie, check this out.
This is a Brigger 3300. Toughest safe in the world.
-What do you do? -Drill the lock.
No, you gotta check to see if it's open.
It's open!
What?
No, I'm messing with you. They would never do that.
They would never do that.
Glasses.
-I'll see you back up top. -Right.
Open sesame.
Come on, Eddie.
-Got the rock? -Miles is right behind me.
Eddie.
What the hell you doing?
Seventeen million four ways?
I'm too greedy for that.
No, just come on, man!
Shit!
Come here, gorgeous.
Got the rock. Time to roll.
Hurry! There's lots...
...of activity here. Let's go!
Shit!
Freeze!
Clear!
Let's go!
-Stay down! Don't move! -Let me see your hands!
Hey, Miles.
-Where's Eddie? -He went over already.
-You have the rock? -What?
You got the rock?
-What you doing? -Give me the rock!
You ain't got to do this!
We're supposed to split this shit, man! Why you doing this?
Shit!
Miles, you're dead, you piece of shit!
Damn!
Good doggie!
Good doggie!
Kibbles 'n Bits! Easy.
Where's the nearest exit?
Stay where you are!
Turn around!
I'm a carpenter! I was working late!
See? That's the saw! See? I was working!
You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you.
If you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
Do you understand your rights?
-Understand your rights? -Yeah, I understand them.
Ain't nothing but a free thing, baby!
Free man. Believe that.
One belt, one shoelace...
...one wallet containing $22.
One shoelace?
You know how much them shoes cost? One shoelace?
I came in here with two.
You took my shoelace? Did you take my shoelace, man?
You got two seconds to walk out that door.
Sign out...
...and leave my pen.
I'm signing out.
I got places to go, people to see.
My lady, Janiece.
Ass....
It's like that.
What you gonna do with one shoelace? Let me in on the secret.
Floss your ass?
Gotta go.
Y'all stay up, man. Don't be mad because I gotta go.
Come on, open this fence. Thanks. I'm out of here.
Where them butt-naked hoes at? Do you know?
Let me up out of here.
I'm free! I'm free at last!
Gotta go! Gotta go, gotta go!
I'm out of here!
Damn!
What happened?
Did you eat the whole time I was in there?
When I left, you was like:
Now, you're like:
Wait a minute. That's all right. I can adjust.
It's the love that counts. I can adjust to a plus-size woman.
Just more cushion for the pushing.
Janiece!
Your sad-ass sack of bones is here.
I apologize. You're her cousin.
Can I buy you some cereal?
It's okay, Shawna.
There you are. Just hot!
Baby, you are....
You look beautiful.
You are beautiful. And that's not two years of prison talking.
Baby, it must've been hard in there for you.
All alone at night in your little cot.
Tell me something, Miles.
Did you think about me?
Think about you all the time.
Think about you right now.
Then you should've thought about that before you robbed people!
I never robbed you!
I'm a rehabilitated man!
Talk to me.
I didn't come see you for two years. Wasn't that a sign?
You couldn't stand to see your man like that.
Man? You're not my man. You lie. You told me you were a banker.
Bank robber. Yeah, see, sometime I stutter.
But I'm getting that whole speech impediment thing--
You are a very smart man, but the time we spent together was one big lie.
Look, Janiece. Listen to me, okay?
I know I lied about some things, but I can change.
I don't think so.
-Bye! -Don't do me like this!
Fifth and Grand?
To protect and--
Hi. How you doing? Is this really a police station?
Of course.
Hi. I have a delivery for Traffic.
Oh, yeah. Sign by the X.
What have we got? Egg roll, orange chicken....
Hot pizza coming through. Hot pizza!
Got to get the officers their pizza.
They got to protect and serve. The police got to eat too!
Let the officers eat, please.
I'm the pizza man here to deliver the pizza. Thank you.
Officers, I got your pizzas!
"Third Floor: Robbery-Homicide."
Yeah, please be careful. Pizza's very hot.
Don't want nobody to get hurt. Just got here some pizza for you.
Pizza for you. That's how we do it down at the pizza place.
Watch it, watch it, watch it!
Two time, bring it up! Don't drop the pizza!
Pizza delivery for Robbery-Homicide.
Robbery-Homicide?
Why is it I don't see Robbery-Homicide...
...with a pizza delivery in the log-in sheet?
I'll tell you what. Why don't you leave that pizza with me?
No, I'll tell you what. Last time I left a pizza here...
...it magically disappeared.
I mean, it's just like leaving candy around me.
It's not gonna be all right. I'm gonna...chomp it up. See?
Two kinds of people get through that door:
People wearing handcuffs. People wearing a badge.
You don't have on either.
Well, I don't have a badge or handcuffs, so....
Officer Carlson.
-We wanna flip that card right over. -Sorry. Just got it.
Excuse me, officer.
The guys in Homicide ordered this pizza about an hour ago.
I don't wanna leave them with Shamu over there.
-I'm not sure what you want me to do. -Take them!
-I'm on duty. I can't do that. -Yes, you can!
Please take that!
Thank you very much!
Break it down.
Two time, left!
One time! Break it down to the ground!
Go here!
Left leg! Bring it around!
Walk!
You hid a diamond in the police station?
I didn't know it was a police station. Can you change the ID or not?
Sure, but won't they be suspicious of a pizza man with a security clearance?
I'm not going back as a pizza man.
What are you going as?
-A cop. -A cop?
A new transfer.
That's why I need that ID and a new file for detective.
Why a detective?
That's where the rock is.
It's gonna be expensive.
Uncle Lou, I thought we was like family.
Yeah, well, "like family" is not family.
If you were family, you'd want it for free, right?
Well, you ain't changed. I'll see you later.
Get down!
Put some clothes on! Get your butt-naked ass down!
Get your butt-naked ass down!
He's naked and he's stinking. Somebody get him some clothes.
He's hiding a gun in his ass!
Get on the ground. Do it now.
Don't I know you?
Freeze! Cuff him!
Yeah, cuff his ass.
I'm gonna cuff you like that.
I'm the good cop. You act up, I'll turn into the bad one.
Freeze! Get them up!
Spread your legs now.
I'm an officer of the law.
Any sign of Deacon?
Last I heard, he was pulling rip jobs in Carson.
-I warned you about that guy. -That you did.
He'll know you're out.
This is purely cosmetic. It won't check out.
Don't worry. I'll be out of there in an hour, max. Thanks.
Good luck.
Hey there, officer dog.
-I'm a detective. -Sorry, sir.
She's never done that.
Must be the pastrami.
Bitch!
Are you going up?
Yeah, yeah. Up. Third floor.
Appreciate it.
-What? -What?
The vehicle belonged to your friend, but you don't remember his name?
Do you have a last name?
Damn, these cuffs are tight, man!
Miss Green, could you tell this man to loosen these cuffs?
I can't feel my fingers, man. I'm serious. Please?
-I know it. -Detective.
Not so tight.
Maybe I could loosen them up a bit.
-Okay. -Thank you.
You got a great lawyer there. Top of the line. Here you go.
He's in here!
Jesus!
How y'all doing?
Not again, Carlson!
The guy body-slammed me, sir.
Maybe he likes you.
He did what to you?
Get him out of here! What were you thinking? Man, that's not smart!
Get him out of here.
What the hell happened up there?
Up here?
I caught him trying to escape.
Who the hell are you?
Malone. Just transferred. Right there.
Yeah, check that out. Bam!
-You know Malone? -No.
Nobody told me about it.
Guys....
-Sorry, ma'am. -Excuse me.
Let me flush, please.
I didn't know. You might not wanna go in there.
You got some paperwork for me, Malone?
We've been requesting a new detective for 8 months.
Suddenly, you just turn up. I'll never understand the system.
Burglary? Sixteen citations, mayor's commendation.
You worked out of West Covina?
Well, that's what it says right there.
You look familiar, Malone. Have we met before?
You wouldn't happen to be in a bowling league, would you?
That's it. You're a bowler.
-I try. -We could use a guy in Burglary.
Carlson.
Right here.
I thought I was gonna be assigned to a desk. Right up in here!
Are you kidding me?
A guy like you? No, you belong on the street.
And also, listen.
Carlson needs a partner with some experience. He just got promoted.
Chief, I just got a call.
Malone's gonna join us. Show him around, and....
Carlson. Let Malone do all the handcuffing, okay?
I appreciate that, yeah.
I'll review these.
All right, well, this is the bullpen here. That's Booking up there.
The holding cells are down that way. You wanna see them?
Seen one, seen them all.
This is my desk here, sir.
Nice desk.
Thanks. Let's see....
Brass is on five.
Robbery-Homicide on three.
Over there, that's the tag and bag.
-Through those doors, that's 10-17. -Roger. -Carlson. -Yes, sir.
Show him the rest later.
-Come on. -Where?
We got a call. Burglary. It's ours. I'll take this.
-Outside? -That's where all the crime is.
I just got here, and that's not a good thing.
I gotta do work in here so that I know what's going on out there.
I might need backup, right?
How long you been in Burglary?
Me? All my life, man, all my life.
I heard the chief say that you got 16 citations. That's incredible. Sixteen.
That's what happens when your Uncle Lou writes your file.
You can ride up front if you want.
I knew that.
You just gotta be real careful for the pedestrians coming out here.
Walking around out here.
Am I clear to the right? Am I clear? Have I got it?
Yeah, I just made detective.
-No kidding. -Yeah.
I worked Traffic for three years. I got pretty good at it.
You don't have to stop for the yellow. You could just drive right through.
Sir, not if you'd seen some of the accidents I've seen. No thanks.
-Well, there's your green right there. -Oh, yeah.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Yeah, sure.
How many times did you take the test?
-What test? -You know, the test for detective.
That one!
-One time. -Really?
-Aced it. -Really?
Took it out.
Took me five tries.
I did well on the written part, but my performance reviews weren't so hot.
How many times did it take you to get your driver's license, man?
Please! Wake me up when we get there.
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
Goodness, man!
It's a nice suit, sir. It's really cool.
Well, I appreciate it.
Yeah, you know? Appreciate it.
-Got any music? -Oh, yeah. Sure.
I like to jam.
Just so long as we can hear the dispatcher.
That's good.
-I never heard this station before. -Kind of funky. You like that?
Last night these shelves were loaded with Elites. Now they're gone.
Three dozen gorgeous rims.
They didn't take anything else?
They went for my good stuff. Chrome with gold trim. Five grand worth.
What about the alarm?
What about it? It went off.
But it took you guys two hours to get here.
My wheels are probably in Tijuana by now.
Here's where they came in.
Looks like they broke the glass, opened the handle...
...crawled in the window.
Exactly.
Shimmied down the shelf or something.
This is a waste of time.
That's not how they got in.
Of course it is.
Cut it out. That's not how they got in.
This is the spot here.
That's how I would've came in.
If I was a thief.
If I was a thief!
Skylight. Just cut the alarm from the inside.
I could take my time.
Why take your time?
Why would I take my time?
It's heavy.
Now, you tell me.
How long would it take to carry three dozen out and load them in a truck?
-Long time. -It would take a very long time.
But they probably had three or four guys working the damn thing--
Zip! Zip the shit up! Frank, hush.
Because you know better. Come on.
Don't lie to me. I'm the man. I'm the man, Frank.
You're the man.
Your 5000, sorry to tell you, is worth less than two on the street.
Which don't go four ways with much juice once you rent a truck.
And to rent a truck, that requires what?
Credit card...
...driver's license.
Unless, of course...
...you got your own truck.
He's not gonna let us search his truck.
What you mean, "let us"? We the police.
We need a warrant to do that.
We don't even need a key.
Detective, you can't do that. It's unconstitutional.
Look at that. Look at this.
Look. Solved the crime my first day on the job!
-We bad detectives. -There they are!
Filing a false report is a very serious crime.
I'll handle this. Bring your weeble-wobble ass over here.
-You like snacks? -Nothing makes me happier.
You'll be snacking on the bottom of this shoe if this happens again.
Now, you see them ridges?
These ridges will be imprinted on the back of your ass...
...permanently if this happens again.
You understand?
Thoroughly understand you.
Every time you look at your ass there's gonna be a print there.
It's gonna remind you of me and my partner.
-And for you lying. -Right.
Don't wanna see those ridges.
Stop eating cold cuts because it's seeping through your pores.
Will do.
I'll put one ridge on your ass.
Let's roll. That's cool. Let's get out of here.
Detective, I know I'm new at this...
...but I thought we were supposed to arrest the bad guys.
Now he owes us one.
So that's how it works.
We let the little fish go, so that we can catch the big fish later.
-I got it. I got it. -Yeah.
You mind if I drive? I know a shortcut. Yeah. Okay.
You might wanna buckle up.
Are you in a hurry, sir?
No. Just testing your car. Balancing out your shit.
When was the last time you got all up on this thing?
I've never gotten all up on anything, sir.
Yeah, well, sometimes you gotta feed some speed to your ride.
Sir! Watch it!
Hey. This is the police! Move your busted-ass vehicle!
Move, move, move!
This is the L.A.P.D.
We'll pop one in your ass.
We got guns and shit.
I could get used to this!
I like! I like!
Used to what?
Driving. See, my last partner did all the driving.
Who was your partner?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Why?
Hey, look, I'm deep, okay? There's just some places I can't talk about.
We're partners. Gotta communicate. This thing's like a marriage.
No, this is nothing like a marriage.
-What is it like? -It's more like a one-night stand.
Wham, bam, thank you, officer.
-It's like that? -It's like that.
We're just gonna fight crime and zip the rest of that shit up.
-Are you married? -No.
-Girlfriend? -Not anymore.
What happened?
-Work got in the way. -Okay.
See?
Somebody took out a fire hydrant.
-I'll handle this. -I gotta get back. I got a headache.
We're on duty.
But I need an aspirin. A big one, like a hockey puck.
Gentlemen. Excuse me.
Could you come here for a second?
Relax, sir. Just take it easy for a second.
Morning, officer.
Morning. Where's your aspirins?
Back there by the soda machines.
Appreciate it.
I wanna know how the car hit the fire hydrant.
-Open the register! -Don't shoot!
Come on, man!
-Oh, man! -Come on! The safe too!
Come on.
37-King-5. Shots fired. Request help.
418 West Fifth Street.
Detective Malone!
You okay?
Oh, shit!
Get back! Back! Get back!
Time out, time out.
All right, I'm leaving.
-I don't want-- -Freeze!
Put your hands on the pavement!
-Hands on the pavement! -There is no pavement!
Put them on the Oodles of Noodles.
-Put them on the noodles. -Chicken or beef?
Chicken.
Cool. Cool is good.
Miles?
Tulley? Oh, man, shit!
-Tulley. -What are you doing?
What am I doing? What are you doing?
I'm freaking working over here. -Detective Malone! -What?
I'm coming in!
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down!
Detective Malone, talk to me!
Go out the back way!
Go! The back way!
Go out the back way!
Detective, talk to me!
Take two steps back!
What the hell? Go!
Hold it!
Hold your fire!
-You okay? -Yeah, yeah.
Listen, it's a dead end!
No shit!
He's behind those dumpsters. He's freaking out. He's got a gun.
Back up!
Get SWAT up here! Sharpshooters can take him off from the roof.
No!
No sharpshooters.
Why the hell not?
What are you doing here, man?
-Who's he talking to? -I don't know.
He high, man. He's hallucinating. Smoking that shit!
He's high.
Put down the gun and come out!
-Hold this. Hold on. I'm going in. -What are you doing?
What are you, crazy?
Miles, what are you doing here?
I just wanna talk to you before somebody gets hurt! -Go away! -Please put down the gun!
-Go away! -Please put down the gun!
-Son, come on. -Shut up!
It hurts my heart...
...to see a kid that has so much potential.
-You're smarter than that. -I'm coming out!
Listen. All right, now, goddamn it! What are you doing?
What are you doing? You got me out here in this shit.
How many times I told you...
...forget the safe? Go straight for the cash drawer. Get in and get out.
He's in the way. Now I can't even get a shot.
I can't either.
Why are you hitting mom-and-pop stores anyway?
Look, you're a driver, man.
You got skills. You can be out there on the road, man, doing your shit.
I'm desperate! I need some money! And why the freak are we whispering?
Back up, nigga! I saw you!
-What are they talking about? -I don't know.
I'm working on something here, and you're blowing it for me, man!
I'm sorry, man. I'm messing up.
-I'm messing up. -It's all right.
Look, I'm not mad at you.
But you're gonna have to give me the gun and let me arrest you.
-No. -Tulley. Come on, man. Listen. I'll give you 10 grand. You know I'm good for it.
I'm thinking like 50, man.
Tulley, 50? That's pushing it, man! Damn!
Twenty, and you'll spend one night in jail. That's the best I can do.
That's it. Best I can do.
All right, fine. But I'm keeping my gun.
You cannot let me arrest you and keep the gun, man. Come on.
Damn, I just got this, man. This is hard to find.
But you're gonna have to give up the gun. Now, what you wanna do?
You wanna give up the gun or you want about seven bullets in your ass?
Okay, now give me that gun!
No.
Don't just hand it to me.
I gotta take it from you. They're watching.
This is gonna hurt a little.
This is gonna hurt.
Jesus!
That's incredible!
And remember: You don't know me anymore.
I sure don't.
You didn't used to be so violent.
So he's like, "Carlson, take my jacket."
He's like, "I got to do this." We're like, "What are you doing?"
He just goes right down the alley, right up to the guy.
Next thing you know, he's taking the guy's gun.
Dropped the guy with a punch. Just leveled him.
I mean, blink and you would've missed it.
Malone, in my office!
Now!
Not you, Carlson.
I've been looking through your record.
How come I never heard of you?
I was undercover. On the down low.
We need a guy to head Burglary. Is that the real reason you're here?
-Yeah, sure. -It's no secret.
Burglary's been a problem since we lost our lead detective last year.
Now, usually we promote from within the ranks...
...but these guys need someone new.
So if you want the job, you got it.
Excuse me?
You're the new lead detective. Burglary division.
Me? Now....
Technically, there's a 30-day period before I can "make it official."
But with your record I don't think there'll be any problem.
Well, say something!
Thank you.
Let's party?
What is this? High school?
Listen up. Now Detective Malone is Burglary's new acting lead detective.
-Get these processed ASAP. -Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Carlson, Carlson.
I got some things I gotta do. I'll catch up with you later.
I'll take these.
-You know what to do with these? -Sure.
Great, sir. Sorry.
-Captain Penelli? -I'm busy now.
Oh, man!
Shit!
Damn!
-Malone. -What? Yeah.
How do you want me to handle the rotation?
I don't understand. What you mean, "rotation"?
The shifts.
I can't figure out everything on the first day, all right?
I notice you guys had a leak here. What's that about?
One of the hot-water pipes burst, flooded all the vents.
-Vents? -They had to flush out the whole system.
This must be the guy everybody's talking about.
Captain Penelli, Detective Malone.
Malone, Penelli.
I hear great things. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Nice to meet you too there, sir!
Very nice to meet you!
Glad to be here.
Gotta go!
He's a strange one. Oh, yeah.
Place is closed.
I said we're closed. I should've locked up.
Nice to see you, Lou.
I'm looking for Miles.
Well, I haven't seen him.
I got an important message from his mother.
Well, I still haven't seen him.
Quiet.
Damn, you're good.
You are good.
Good morning. Listen up.
Word is that Jean LaFleur is bringing a shipment of heroin through town.
They want him in San Diego.
San Diego P.D.'s done an excellent job...
...shutting down the harbor and the airports on him.
Detective Malone just transferred. He'll head our Burglary division.
Detective...
...tell us a little about your plans.
Well, I plan to fight crime.
-You know, shit like that. -Great, then.
Does anybody have any questions for Malone?
Yeah, I got a question.
What do you think about the P-31?
P-31.
-What do you think? -It's a piece of shit.
Diaz.
What I mean is, we've all been having problems with the P-31, right?
I'm just wondering what the new lead detective here plans to do about it.
Well, all right. Well, Diaz, is it? Diaz?
What do you think we should do about it, Diaz?
I think we should scrap it.
How many people think we should scrap the P-31?
There it is.
Scrapped. Why? Because you want it scrapped.
It's out of there. P-31, out of there. No more. Gone.
You want 31 flavors?
Baskin-Robbins is where you wanna be. Be cool.
That's my partner.
Detective.
What is it?
I'd like to work with a P-40.
Yeah, the P-40's good.
P-40 it is!
What's he doing? We just got those things.
He's shaking things up. Maybe that's exactly what we need.
-I'm not a cop. -Malone.
This Tulley asshole wants to talk to you.
He's down in Interrogation.
Right away. I'll talk with him.
Interrogation's this way.
Knew that. Is he running his mouth?
Tulley says he has information about another robbery.
But he'll only talk to the officer who arrested him.
Okay, well....
I'll talk to him. Alone.
We'll be watching.
What's going on? You said I'd spend one night in jail.
What do you wanna tell me? What is it?
You said I'd only spend one night in jail.
It's only been one night.
Well, where's my 50 grand?
I said 20 grand.
Well, maybe it's 50 now! Because--
Detectives, I've been assigned to Mr. Tulley.
Well, great. That's him.
Oh, my God! What in the world?
-Help me! -What's going on?
-Help! -What is this?
Oh, my God!
Take your hands off my client!
It's no use. He ain't talking!
You have your hand over his mouth!
I think we accomplished enough for one day.
This guy said he has information on another case.
I wanna know, are you jerking our chain or not?
I'm not jerking your chain, fella.
This guy Logan owes me 50 thousand dollars.
If I don't get it soon...
-...I'm talking! -All right.
Who's Logan? And what do you know about him?
All I can tell you, sir, is that he's gay, gay, gay!
I've had enough of this!
You certainly have. Come with me. You'll be hearing from my office!
-He made me bite my tongue. -Come here.
He hit me here.
Next time use a phone book on him.
And they took my shoelace.
Hearing from your office.
Look how she's all over him.
And then he said I was ugly and I couldn't read good.
-Malone. -Hey, man. What's up?
Some guy's been calling for you.
-Who was it? -Said he's your old partner.
He hopes you found what you're looking for.
Your health benefits expire soon.
Whatever the hell that's supposed to mean.
Shit!
Bingo!
What is it with you and the heating ducts, sir?
Cold. You don't feel that?
Very cold.
But I'm busy. What is it you want?
But I'm busy. What is it you want? I just tried to pull up your records.
I couldn't find any Malone.
Oh, that's probably because it was spelled....
When I put the name in the list--
The badge number doesn't exist.
Let me talk to you.
-I wanna find out what's going on. -You're gonna find out.
Now, look.
What I'm about to tell you is classified.
You tell anyone, I will bust your ass down to parade detail.
-I've been on that detail. -You have?
-That's permanent horseshit patrol. -Okay, yes, sir.
Okay?
This place is a cesspool. But listen.
I'm not from West Covina.
I'm from Internal Affairs.
Oh, man!
All right? This place is a cesspool.
-I can't believe I didn't notice. -It is.
I mean, it doesn't seem like a cesspool.
Believe it, man. There's a lot of dirty shit going on here.
That's why they sent me here.
I'm the supercop. They said, "Go, investigate.
Do what you do. Find another supercop.
Y'all supercop up as a team, and crack down the shit.
Crack it down." That's what I'm here to do.
Are we the only guys that know about it? We're in the shit now!
You are a good cop, Carlson.
But damn it, man, you just dug too deep.
What do you want me to do?
Good thing you asked.
Keep your eyes open. Okay? I need you to be here.
And watch my back. Watch my back.
Got it, sir. I'm out of here.
The other way. Go back.
Shit!
Evidence room.
-Shit! -Malone!
There you are. I just got a call.
-There's a 413 in progress at the airport. -Go ahead. I'll catch up.
Bullshit! Someone just stole a museum exhibit from a cargo hold.
That's my problem?
You're lead detective.
Get out there now!
The FBI and Customs Service is already on the case.
-Why are you standing here? -They won't let me in.
Feds are all over it.
That's bullshit!
These boxes contained an entire Egyptian temple.
Excuse me, here. Let me see this. Man!
And who are you?
Malone. L.A.P.D.
Agent Gray. FBI.
We'll let you boys in after we're done.
Look at all this stuff.
Look. They nearly destroyed all this stuff, and they didn't take none of it.
Look, Officer Malone.
Detective.
You know, you're out of your jurisdiction, and you're over your head.
I'm over my head? No, I'm over your head...
...because your head's up your ass.
You're interfering with a federal investigation, officer.
Now, if you and your bunch wanna feel important...
...you can help secure the outer perimeter.
Are we clear?
Yeah. We clear.
And please...
...tell your men not to touch anything on their way out.
-It's like that? -Yeah, it's like that.
"Head up your ass." That was great.
I couldn't believe you said that.
He called me "officer."
I'm lead detective. I have 16 citations.
You think that comes easy?
Come on. The guy's nothing but an FBI asshole.
He thinks we're good for nothing but sucking down doughnuts.
Let them chase their own goddamn temple.
They weren't looking for no temple. They were looking for drugs. -Drugs? -Yes, drugs.
-Drugs? -Yes, drugs.
It's the oldest trick in the book.
You smuggle it in...
...boost it before it hits customs, right? Make it look like a heist.
That's how all the big boys do it.
All they have to do is look for a truck with a letter B on it.
What do you mean, B?
"Bonded."
Bonded trucks can get into bonded warehouses.
Let me ask you:
How do you know all this stuff?
Did a little work in bonded warehouses.
All right. So what are we waiting for?
Let's do something, all right? Come on. Call in air support.
Dispatch, this is 37-King-5...
...put me through to South Bay air support.
Ten-twelve. I've got a white panel truck...
...B-961, southbound on Wheeler near Manhattan Beach intersection.
Roger. We're close.
Shit!
Now you're in a hurry?
Sometimes you gotta feed a little speed to your ride.
You know what I'm saying?
Here we go.
-Check out the driver. -Yeah.
Five-foot-six, greasy hair, messy, very disheveled and--
Are you a hairdresser or a detective, man?
That's a jailhouse tat.
Driver did a stretch somewhere.
Ten-twelve. Requesting backup.
L.A.P.D., this is Agent Gray. FBI.
Stand down. I repeat: Stand down.
This is bullshit!
Screw them. Come on! Let's do it!
Come on, you!
Come on, get the door.
Come on!
Drop your weapons! Put it down.
All right, don't move! Stand still!
Put it down!
Malone! Take him! He's yours!
Don't you run from me! Don't you run!
Let's see those hands, butterball.
Come here! You wanna make me run?
Come back here!
Come back here!
Bring your ass here!
Come here! I'm not playing.
Come here!
It's okay. Don't worry. I'm a cop.
All right?
Damn!
Don't you know better than to run from the police?
-I do. -You got me tired. I don't like tired.
When I get tired, I got ass to whup.
And I think that's what I'm about to do. Get your ass up!
Bingo.
That's the shit.
We showed them, and that's what I wanted to do, you know?
-Put this into evidence. -Exactly.
Evidence. I'll go up with it.
I want you interrogating those men right now.
No. See, I need to go up with this stuff...
...and book it into evidence personally.
Why?
I gotta go through it for clues and shit.
First, interrogate the suspects. Find out where they were going.
When you get them to talk, you can go through all the evidence you want.
But, sir....
If I get the clue, it'd make for a better ass-whupping interrogation.
Let's hear it for Detective Malone!
That's it! I want a lawyer. You cops can't do this.
I got news for you. I ain't a cop.
God, he's good.
I checked. West Covina never heard of him.
-So you know. -Know what?
He's Internal Affairs.
What are you talking about? He's not I.A.
-He's not? -Hell, no. He's FBI.
But he hates the FBI.
That's to throw you off. You think this is an accident?
He knew about the heroin from the start. FBI planted him here.
Thought he'd get first jump on the burglary. Afraid we'd screw it up.
Pencil-dicks.
You don't get that training at the academy.
No, that's old school, man.
You're crushing my head!
That's federal government training.
Like Navy SEAL stuff.
Come on. Let's go give him a hand.
All right! All right! I'll talk! Oh, man!
Look at you.
-It was all worth it for you, baby. -Malone!
What are you doing up there?
I'm just so happy that we're keeping these drugs off the street.
Get over it. They're going right back out again.
-Why? -Because the FBI wants to take it...
...to their lab right away.
-Roll it out. -But--
Malone, come on!
Let's go.
Come on, Malone.
-Detective. -Malone.
That heroin belongs to Jean LaFleur.
We've been after him for 5 years.
He keeps shifting his operations between the U.S. and Mexico.
We're taking it down to our lab right now.
That's not a good idea.
Why not?
Why don't we just keep it here?
LaFleur doesn't know we have it. We could use it for bait.
You mean a sting?
Exactly. A sting!
LaFleur expects these drugs to be in San Diego in three hours.
What kind of sting operation can you get off the ground before then?
The driver told me one of the guys on the truck was new.
You can replace him with somebody else.
Then catch LaFleur when he goes to pick up the drugs. Bam, got him!
Let me get this straight.
You're volunteering to escort these drugs into the hands...
...of the most dangerous dealer in the northern hemisphere?
Hell, no!
What do you need to make it work?
-Me? -You're the man for the job!
FBI will have tactical command, but we'll follow your lead.
It's very brave. Let's go. There's not much time.
Way to go, Malone. Way to go.
-I'm just suggesting some shit. -We need more men like you!
All right. Hurry up. Go. Get out of here!
Wait. Hold up. Wait a minute.
You wanted to go. I'm getting you out of here. Go!
You wouldn't still be here unless that diamond was here.
-I want my cut! -There ain't nothing to cut.
-I want my cut! -There ain't nothing to cut. I'm trying, but I gotta get the diamond first.
Go get it. I'll wait.
I'm trying to. First, I gotta run a sting on a drug dealer.
You're a goddamn liar!
Would I make this shit up? Get out of here!
-I'll see you at Lou's tomorrow. -I wanna talk about this!
I don't know what you're doing...
...but it ain't gonna work!
And let me get my gun back!
Look. Maybe this isn't a good idea, you know?
-This is a great idea. It'll work. -Brilliant.
-LaFleur's looking for this. -We know what we're doing, detective.
-Oh, I'm a detective now. -Detective.
Give us a level, please.
All right, detective.
The objective is to have these men see you as if you were one of them:
A member of the criminal underworld. It's important your actions, speech...
...and general behavior are congruent with their expectation of a criminal.
I get it. Sort of "walk the walk."
That's right.
You have to look, act...
...and even think like a criminal.
Change your speech patterns too.
Criminals like to use slang terminology, profanity and so forth...
...especially with regard to police and authority figures.
You mean like, "Shut the hell up, you dickless FBI--"
-That's right. -"You stupid ass."
-That'll do. -"You tight--"
Enough!
All right, listen up.
LaFleur's a killer.
If he senses anything amiss, Malone is gonna be in one hell of a tight spot.
If anything happens to me, forget everything I ever told you.
You mean about Internal Affairs?
No, Carlson. I mean about everything.
-Detective, saddle up. -Okay?
Good luck.
Carlson, remember. Forget it!
Time to go.
Detective.
If my client gets a scratch on him while he's in your custody...
...I'll see your badge is revoked and you're thrown in jail. Okay?
You can't touch me.
He'll be fine, counselor. Malone, let's get this show on the road.
Drive. Buckle up.
-Give me video. -Let's get one thing straight.
This is my side here and that's your side there.
Stay on your side and I'm gonna stay on mine.
Gentlemen. Keep the chatter to a minimum.
You don't like the show, change the channel.
And keep this channel clear.
Who is this guy?
That's Malone.
I can't drive if you do that.
Drive!
We're coming up on our exit.
All units, this is Gray. Fall back and keep your distance.
We're approaching the site.
L.A.P.D., take the south side. We'll take the north.
They're headed into Warehouse 3.
Focus in. Closer.
This is it.
-You sure? -Yeah. Warehouse 3.
All right, Benny, sit tight and keep your mouth shut.
Thanks for the tip.
What's Malone doing?
They're coming in behind you.
Get ready. Here he comes.
That's what I'm talking about!
-That's the shit. -You're right!
All 500 kilos!
What are you talking about? Let's get out! I want my cut!
-You still got it? -We still have a signal.
It's just distorted.
Can you hear him?
We can't get out of here, okay? They got cops everywhere.
-So? You're one of them. -No, no, no.
I'm a drug dealer now.
Man, listen to me. You're a jewel thief.
I'm a drug dealer now!
Why you selling this when you got that diamond?
Just like old times.
I don't believe that shit!
Is this a reunion?
Look what we got here. Give it up.
Isn't that beautiful? Say bye.
Welcome to the party.
Son of a bitch!
We've lost him.
I'll enjoy doing you more than I did Eddie.
-Deacon, man-- -Shut up!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Know anything about this? -I don't know shit!
I'm gonna throw up.
What the hell? All units, stand by.
-What's going on? -I don't know!
I never know what's going on!
Take it down! Here. Bring it in.
-Out of the truck. Out of the truck! -You guys. Come on. Get out.
Benny, what's going on?
It took longer than I thought.
-What happened to your face? -Nothing. Not a big deal.
Who hired these two guys?
I did. You told me to get guys.
You didn't introduce me. How you doing?
Pete. Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.
And who might you be?
Don't mess with him. That's a stone-cold killer.
You don't want to mess with him. He's stone-cold.
That boy is bad. I seen him rip somebody's guts through their ass...
...and their eyes fell out.
Do the move you do!
The gut-and-eyes move.
That's where they went splat. Just dropped them.
I'm bad.
I'll rip your lips off and kiss my ass with them shits.
I seen him do it.
I do that. That's how I get down.
I'll rip your tongue out and lick my balls with them.
Shut up.
Check him out.
Francois, you search him.
-We're moving in. -No, wait.
This must be a part of his plan.
What plan? He's unarmed and outnumbered.
Trust me. You should see Malone's résumé.
This is like a walk in the park for him.
I must tell you, Pete.
You look the part...
...you certainly talk the talk...
...but you still stink like a cop.
Damn it! I knew he would catch us, man.
Shut up! That's bullshit.
Come on, man. Just talk to him. We might get out of here!
See? He's lying!
If I was a cop, would I have busted his shit? That's bleeding!
Lock him in the car.
Get him out of here.
If I was a cop--
Shut up!
My nose bleeding!
Damn!
You better tell us the truth.
He's a cop.
He hijacked the truck. This is a setup.
If I was a cop, FBIs would be in here right now, man...
...taking everybody to jail!
I think...
...I have an idea.
You wanna prove you aren't a cop?
You say he's lying.
Damn right.
Shoot him.
Shoot him.
No problem.
-You son of a bitch! -I meant, kill him.
You didn't say that. You just said, "Shoot him."
You wanna prove you aren't a cop?
Kill him.
There ain't no coming back for him.
That's it. We're moving in. All units, move in.
Let's go!
Shit!
Give me the diamond or I'll pop one in your ass!
You had your chance.
Freeze! L.A.P.D.!
Show me your hands!
Nice shot.
Get out of the car! Turn around!
Shit!
All units, this is Agent Gray, FBI.
We have no authority to pursue the suspect beyond our border.
Do not cross into Mexico!
Pursuit heading southbound. We have an undercover officer onboard.
I repeat: We have a friendly onboard. Over!
Roger that!
Hold on!
Shit!
Look out!
Get him! I'm glad to see y'all!
What you waiting for? Go!
We can't, Malone. We have no jurisdiction.
Damn that! Damn the jurisdiction! Go! Now!
We cannot cross into Mexico.
-You can't? You can't? -No. No!
-Watch me. -Malone. Malone!
Believe that!
-Malone! -Move your ass!
Damn it! One bullet.
Come on, Miles!
Shit!
-You're under arrest. -What are you doing?
-I'm arresting you before they get here. -Oh, yeah?
Maybe I'll blow your head off before they get here.
No, no. The way I see it is you got 30 seconds...
...before they make a piñata out of you.
What are they talking about?
Malone is an expert negotiator.
He's an expert, sir.
You got two choices.
You can wind up somebody's bitch...
...or somebody's señorita.
Make up your mind. Your choice.
I got three choices. Maybe I just tell them who you are.
You'll shut your mouth. Maybe I'll cut you in on the diamond.
Shithead, I got the goddamn diamond.
Let me get that. I'm your only way out!
Now, give me the gun.
You don't wanna go to jail in Mexico.
Nobody wanna go to jail in Mexico. They put burritos in your ass.
Shut up!
Come on, Deke. Give me the gun. Come on!
They think I'm a cop! They think I'm a cop, man!
I can help you, okay?
You don't wanna die here. Now give that up.
If you screw me, I swear to God, I'll come back for you.
I'll come back for you!
Give me the gun!
There you go. Let me get that from you.
Come on. Let it go.
There you go.
This is gonna hurt a bit.
Holy Christ!
That's for Eddie.
You son of a bitch!
Come back here!
You son of a bitch!
Miles, you die!
-You all right? -Yeah.
I needed a vacation anyway, right?
The FBI needs to talk to you, Detective Malone.
Peterson, regional director, FBI. We need to talk.
Wait a minute. Slow down.
No, lieutenant, I will not slow down.
Is this man one of yours...
...or not?
You bet your ass he is.
Well, I'm gonna find out what happened here...
...even if it means putting your entire department under federal review.
Nice work.
My office spent an hour talking to West Covina...
...and the U.S. Attorney's Office...
...trying to find out just who it is you're working for.
Now we know it's not the Bureau.
It's time that you gave us an explanation.
-I'm a federale. -A federale?
Look across that border. What do you see?
That is the Democratic Republic of Mexico.
-You're Mexican? -That's right.
On my mother's father's side.
I can see it.
Glacias, thank you.
Gentlemen, I shouldn't be telling y'all this.
I could lose my federale-hood.
-Your what? -My federale-hood!
Look, I had to throw you guys off, okay?
I was doing it for my country.
The red...
...the white...
...and the green.
If you'll excuse me, I have to cross this border...
...and school some of my compadres, you know...
...on things we like to talk about. So y'all stay up. Be cool.
What's happening? Hook a brother up with a taco!
A burrito!
I can't believe so much bad shit can happen on such a beautiful day.
Malone!
Malone.
Yeah, what?
I think your Spanish is a little rusty.
You just told those men you got a big cat in your pants.
That's a Latin thing. Macho. You wouldn't understand.
No, I think I do understand...
...Logan.
What?
How'd you know it was me?
I started thinking if I was Miles Logan...
...and had my diamond hidden in a police building, what would I do?
So I thought like a crook.
Is that right?
I don't believe this.
He's a major felon.
This is one hell of a bust, Carlson.
Yeah. It's a hell of a bust for us.
It's just too bad we can't make it.
-Say what? -Well....
You heard the FBI. They're extremely strict...
...about pursuing suspects across international borders.
And you're just out of our jurisdiction.
You're...?
Exactly, because I'm across the--
If I'm across the border and you're over there, there's no way you--
I love this jurisdiction shit! Oh, man.
I guess this is the last time I'm gonna see you boys.
Yeah. But maybe we'll catch you later.
-Is it like that? -Yeah. It's like that.
Right there. Jurisdiction.
Three minutes.
This is it. Ground zero.
Want to say a few words for the occasion?
With a gun barrel between your teeth, you speak only in vowels.
I can't think of anything.
For a second, I forget about Tyler's controlled demolition thing
and I wonder how clean that gun is.
It's getting exciting now.
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love -
well, it works both ways.
We have front-row seats for this theater of mass destruction.
The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem
wrapped the foundation columns of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.
In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges
and a few square blocks will be reduced to smoldering rubble.
I know this because Tyler knows this.
Two and a half. Think of everything we've accomplished.
Suddenly I realize that all of this - the gun, the bombs, the revolution -
has got something to do with a girl named Marla Singer.
Bob. Bob had bitch tits.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.
The big moosie slobbering all over me, that was Bob.
We're still men.
Yes, we're men.
Men is what we are.
Bob had had his testicles removed. Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch tits cos his testosterone was too high
and his body upped the estrogen.
- That was where I fit. - They'll have to drain my pecs again.
Between those huge, sweating tits
that hung enormous, the way you'd think of God's as big.
OK, you cry now.
No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.
For six months, I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't sleep...
With insomnia, nothing's real.
Everything's far away.
Everything's a copy of a copy
of a copy.
When deep-space exploration ramps up, it'll be corporations that name everything.
The IBM Stellar Sphere.
The Microsoft Galaxy.
The Planet Starbucks.
I need you out of town this week to cover some red flags.
It must have been Tuesday. He had on his cornflower-blue tie.
You want me to deprioritize my reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons. Call me if there's any snags.
He was full of pep. Must have had his grande latte enema.
Like so many others, I had become a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.
- I'd like Erika Pekkari dust ruffles. - Please hold.
If I saw something clever, a coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang, I had to have it.
The Klipsk personal office unit.
The Hovetrekke home exerbike.
Or the Ohamshab sofa with the Strinne green stripe pattern.
Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of environmentally friendly paper.
I'd flip through catalogs and wonder: "What kind of dining set defines me?"
I had it all. Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
proof they were crafted by the honest, hard-working, indigenous peoples of...
- Please hold. - ..wherever.
We used to read pornography.
Now it was the Horchow collection.
- No. You can't die from insomnia. - What about narcolepsy?
I nod off, I wake up in strange places. I have no idea how I got there.
- You need to lighten up. - Can you please give me something?
Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.
Chew some valerian root and get more exercise.
- Hey, come on. I'm in pain. - You wanna see pain?
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesdays. See the guys with testicular cancer.
That's pain.
I always wanted three kids. Two boys and a girl.
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.
We never could agree on anything.
Well, she had her first child last week.
A girl.
With her... with her new husband.
And thank God. You know?
I-I'm glad for her.
Because she deserves it.
Everyone, let's thank Thomas for sharing himself with us.
Thank you, Thomas.
I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage.
And that gives me strength.
We give each other strength.
It's time for the one-on-ones.
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example and really open ourselves up.
Could you find a partner?
And this is how I met the big moosie.
His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.
Knees together. Those awkward little steps.
- My name is Bob. - Bob?
Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.
You know that chest expansion program on late-night TV?
That was his idea.
I was a juicer.
You know - using steroids.
Diabonal and... Wisterol.
Oh, they use that on racehorses, for Chrissakes.
And now I'm bankrupt, I'm divorced,
my two grown kids won't even return my phone calls.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big, rubbery one.
Go ahead... Cornelius.
You can cry.
And then... something happened. I let go.
That's really good.
Lost in oblivion.
Dark and silent and complete.
I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.
It's OK.
Babies don't sleep this well.
I became addicted.
If I didn't say anything, people always assumed the worst.
They cried harder... then I cried harder.
Now we're going to open the green door, the heart chakra...
I wasn't really dying.
I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.
I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
Imagine your pain as a white ball of healing light.
It moves over your body, healing you.
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe.
And step forward through the back door of the room.
Where does it lead?
To your cave.
Step forward into your cave.
That's right.
You're going deeper into your cave,
and you're going to find your power animal.
Slide.
Every evening I died.
And every evening I was born again.
Resurrected.
Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too.
Being there, pressed against his tits, ready to cry.
This was my vacation.
And she... ruined everything.
This is cancer, right?
This chick, Marla Singer, did not have testicular cancer.
She was a liar.
She had no diseases at all.
I had seen her at Free And Clear, my blood parasites group, Thursdays.
Then at Hope, my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.
And again at Seize The Day, my tuberculosis, Friday night.
Marla, the big tourist.
Her lie reflected my lie.
And suddenly, I felt nothing.
I couldn't cry. So once again, I couldn't sleep.
Next group, after guided meditation,
after we open our heart chakras, when it's time to hug,
I'll grab that bitch Marla Singer and scream:
Marla, you liar! You big tourist! I need this! Now, get out!
I hadn't slept in four days.
We'll just let that dry...
When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep
and you're never really awake.
To begin tonight's communion, Chloe would like to say a few words.
Oh, yeah. Chloe.
Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton would look
if you made it walk around a party being extra nice to everybody.
Well, I'm still here.
But I don't know for how long.
That's as much certainty as anyone can give me.
But I've got some good news.
I no longer have any fear of death.
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
No one will have sex with me.
I'm so close to the end, and all I want is to get laid for the last time.
I have pornographic movies in my apartment,
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite. - Thank you, Chloe.
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.
Thank you, Chloe.
Now, let's ready ourself for guided meditation.
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.
You step inside your cave and you walk...
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.
Marla.
The scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would heal if you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
..deeper into your cave as you walk.
You feel a healing energy all around you.
Now find your power animal.
Slide.
OK. Let's partner up.
Pick someone special to you tonight.
Hey.
- We need to talk. - Sure.
- I'm onto you. - What?
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.
Sorry?
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia Plath sense, I know we're all dying.
But you're not dying the way Chloe back there is dying.
So?
So you're a tourist.
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma, I saw you at tuberculosis.
I saw you at testicular cancer!
I saw you practicing this.
- Practicing what? - Telling me off.
Is it going as well as you hoped... "Rupert"?
- I'll expose you. - Go ahead. I'll expose you.
Come together. Let yourselves cry.
- Oh, God. Why are you doing this? - Cheaper than a movie and coffee's free.
Look, this is important. These are my groups. I've been coming for over a year.
- Why do you do it? - I don't know.
When people think you're dying, they really listen to you instead of...
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.
Yeah. Yeah.
Share yourself, completely.
You don't want to get into this. It becomes an addiction.
- Really? - I'm not kidding.
I can't cry if another faker is present, and I need this.
So you gotta find somewhere else to go.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem.
Wait a second. Hold on.
We'll split up the week, OK? You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over at all.
Good. Fine. Testicular cancer should be no contest.
Technically, I have more right to be there. You still have your balls.
- You're kidding. - I dunno. Am I?
No. No.
- What do you want? - I'll take the parasites.
You can't have both. Take the blood parasites.
- I want brain parasites. - I'll take blood, I want brain dementia.
- I want that. - You can't have the whole brain.
So far, you have four. I only have two.
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.
Now we both have three...
Hey! You left half your clothes.
- What, are you selling those? - Yes, I'm selling some clothes.
We each have three. That's six. What about the seventh day? I want bowel cancer.
The girl had done her homework.
- No. No. I want bowel cancer. - That's your favorite too?
- Tried to slip it by me, eh? - Look, we'll split it.
Take the first and third Sunday of the month.
Deal.
- Looks like this is goodbye. - Let's not make a big thing out of it.
How's this for not making a big thing?
Hey, Marla! Marla!
- Maybe we should exchange numbers. - Should we?
We might wanna switch nights.
OK.
This is how I met Marla Singer.
Marla's philosophy of life was that she might die at any moment.
The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.
It doesn't have your name! Who are you?
Cornelius? Rupert? Travis? Any of the stupid names you give each night?
You wake up at SeaTac.
SFO. LAX.
You wake up at O'Hare. Dallas Fort Worth. BWI.
Pacific. Mountain. Central. Lose an hour. Gain an hour.
Check-in for that flight isn't for another two hours.
This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.
You wake up at Air Harbor International.
If you wake up at a different time, in a different place,
could you wake up as a different person?
Everywhere I travel, tiny life.
Single-serving sugar, single-serving cream, single pat of butter.
The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.
Shampoo-conditioner combos. Sample package mouthwash. Tiny bars of soap.
The people I meet on each flight, they're single-serving friends.
Between takeoff and landing, we have our time together, but that's all we get.
Welcome!
On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
I was a recall coordinator. My job was to apply the formula.
The infant went through the windshield. Three points.
A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.
The rear differential locks up.
The teenager's braces are stuck to the ashtray. Make a good anti-smoking ad.
The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.
Now, should we initiate a recall?
Father must've been huge. See where the fat burned to the seat? Polyester shirt?
Very modern art.
Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.
Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.
Multiply the result by the average out-of-court settlement, C.
A x B x C...
equals X.
If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one.
- Are there a lot of these accidents? - You wouldn't believe.
Which car company do you work for?
A major one.
Every time the plane banked too sharply on takeoff or landing,
I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.
Anything.
Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.
"If you are seated in an emergency exit row
and feel unable or unwilling to perform the duties listed on the safety card,
please ask a flight attendant to reseat you."
- It's a lot of responsibility. - Wanna switch seats?
No. I'm not sure I'm the man for that particular job.
An exit-door procedure at 30,000 feet. Mm-hm.
The illusion of safety.
Yeah. I guess so.
You know why they put oxygen masks on planes?
- So you can breathe. - Oxygen gets you high.
In a catastrophic emergency, you take giant panic breaths.
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile. You accept your fate.
It's all right here.
Emergency water landing, 600mph.
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.
That's, um...
That's an interesting theory.
- What do you do? - What do you mean?
- What do you do for a living? - So you can pretend you're interested?
OK.
You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
We have the exact same briefcase.
Soap.
- Sorry? - I make and I sell soap.
The yardstick of civilization.
And this is how I met...
"Tyler Durden."
You know if you mix gasoline and frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?
- No, I did not. Is that true? - That's right.
One can make all kinds of explosives using simple household items.
- Really? - If one were so inclined.
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting single-serving friend I've ever met.
- Everything on a plane's single-serving. - Oh, I get it. Very clever.
Thank you.
How's that working out for you?
- What? - Being clever.
- Great. - Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.
Now, a question of etiquette. As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?
How I came to live with Tyler is...
Airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage.
Was it ticking?
Throwers don't worry. Modern bombs don't tick.
- Sorry. Throwers? - Baggage handlers.
But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Nine times out of ten it's an electric razor, but... every once in a while...
it's a dildo.
It's company policy never to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.
We have to use the indefinite article - "a dildo", never "your dildo".
I don't own...
I had everything in that suitcase. My CK shirts. My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.
Never mind.
Hey! That's my car!
Home was on the 15th floor of a filing cabinet for widows, young professionals.
The walls were solid concrete.
A foot of concrete's important when your next-door neighbor
has to watch game shows at full volume.
Or when a blast of debris that used to be your personal effects
blows out of your windows and sails flaming into the night.
I suppose these things happen.
There's... nothing up there.
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.
Do you have somebody you can call?
How embarrassing. A houseful of condiments and no food.
Police later told me the pilot light might have gone out, letting out a bit of gas.
That could have slowly filled the condo - 1700 square feet with high ceilings -
for days and days.
Then the refrigerator's compressor could have clicked on.
Yeah?
I can hear you breathing, you...
If you ask me now, I couldn't tell you why I called him.
- Hello? - Who's this?
- Tyler? - Who is this?
Um...
We met... we met on the airplane.
We had the same suitcase?
- Uh... the clever guy. - Oh, yeah. Right.
I called a second ago. There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.
Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone.
- So what's up? - Uh...
Well...
You're not gonna believe this.
It could be worse.
A woman could cut off your penis while you sleep and toss it out of a car.
There's always that.
It's just, when you buy furniture, you tell yourself:
"That's the last sofa I'll need. Whatever happens, I got that sofa problem handled."
I had it all. I had a stereo that was very decent.
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.
I was close to being complete.
- Shit, man. And now it's all gone. - All gone.
All gone.
Do you know what a duvet is?
- A comforter. - It's a blanket. Just a blanket.
Why do guys like us know what a duvet is?
Is this essential to our survival in the hunter-gatherer sense?
No.
- What are we, then? - I dunno. Consumers.
Right. We're consumers.
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.
Murder, crime, poverty. These things don't concern me.
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,
television with 500 channels,
some guy's name on my underwear.
Rogaine. Viagra. Olestra.
- Martha Stewart. - Fuck Martha Stewart.
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic. It's all going down.
So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns.
I say never be complete.
I say stop being perfect.
I say let's evolve.
Let the chips fall where they may.
But that's me, and I could be wrong. Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
It's just stuff. It's not a tragedy.
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living.
Fuck, you're right. No, I don't smoke.
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...
- What? - Things you own end up owning you.
But do what you like, man.
Oh, it's late.
- Hey, thanks for the beer. - Yeah, man.
I should find a hotel.
- Oh! - What?
What?
- A hotel? - Yeah.
- Just ask, man. - What are you talking about?
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer and you still can't ask.
- What? - You called cos you need a place to stay.
- Oh, hey. No, no, no. - Yes, you did. So just ask.
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.
Would... would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
- Can I stay at your place? - Yeah.
Thanks.
- I want you to do me a favor. - Yeah, sure.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
- What? - I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Let me tell you a little about Tyler Durden.
Tyler was a night person. While the rest of us slept, he worked.
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel. It comes on a few.
So someone has to switch the projectors at the exact moment
that one reel ends and the next one begins.
If you look, you can see little dots come into the upper right corner of the screen.
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.
That's the cue for a changeover.
He flips the projectors, movie keeps going and the audience has no idea.
- Why would anyone want this shit job? - It affords him interesting opportunities.
Like splicing a frame of pornography into family films.
When the snooty cat and the courageous dog with the celebrity voices first meet,
you'll catch a flash of Tyler's contribution to the film.
- Nobody knows they saw it, they did. - A nice big cock.
Even a hummingbird couldn't catch Tyler at work.
Tyler also worked sometimes as a banquet waiter at the Pressman Hotel.
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.
Apart from seasoning lobster bisque, he farted on meringues, sneezed on endives...
As for the cream of mushroom soup...
- Go ahead, tell 'em. - You get the idea.
- You just want me to hit you? - Come on. Do me this one favor.
- Why? - Don't know. Never been in a fight. You?
- No. But that's a good thing. - You can't know yourself if you haven't.
I don't wanna die without any scars.
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve. - Oh, God. This is crazy.
So go crazy! Let it rip.
- I don't know about this. - I don't either.
Who gives a shit? No one's watching. What do you care?
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?
That's right.
- Where? Like, in the face? - Surprise me.
This is so fucking stupid.
Motherfucker! You hit me in the ear!
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry. - Ow! Christ!
Why the ear, man?
- I fucked it up. - No, that was perfect.
Ugh! Agh!
No, it's all right.
It really hurts.
Right.
- Hit me again. - No, you hit me. Come on!
We should do this again sometime.
- Where's your car? - What car?
I don't know how Tyler found that house, but he said he'd been there for a year.
It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.
Most of the windows were boarded up.
There was no lock on the front door from when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.
The stairs were ready to collapse.
I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting. Neither would've surprised me.
Yep. That's you.
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?
Yeah, thanks.
What a shithole.
Nothing worked.
Turning on one light meant another light in the house went out.
There were no neighbors. Just warehouses and a paper mill.
That fart smell of steam. The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.
Hey. What have we here?
- Hey, guys. - Hey.
Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.
By the end of the first month, I didn't miss TV.
I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.
Can I be next?
All right, man.
Lose the tie.
At night, Tyler and I were alone for half a mile in every direction.
Rain trickled down through the plaster and the light fixtures.
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.
Everywhere were rusted nails to snag your elbow on.
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
- What are you reading? - Listen to this.
It's an article written by an organ in the first person.
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata."
"Without me, Jack could not regulate his heart rate, blood pressure or breathing."
There's a whole series of these.
"I Am Jill's Nipples." "I Am Jack's Colon."
Yeah. "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."
Whoop! Agh!
After fighting, everything else in life got the volume turned down.
What?
- You could deal with anything. - Have you finished those reports?
If you could choose, who would you fight?
I'd fight my boss, probably.
Really?
- Yeah. Why? Who would you fight? - I'd fight my dad.
I don't know my dad.
I mean, I know him, but he left when I was, like, six years old.
Married this other woman and had some other kids. He did this every six years.
- He moves city and starts a new family. - Fucker's setting up franchises.
My dad never went to college, so it was real important that I go.
That sounds familiar.
So I graduate. I call him up long- distance and say, "Dad, now what?"
- He says, "Get a job." - Same here.
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again. "Dad, now what?"
He says, "I dunno. Get married."
You can't get married.
I'm a 30-year-old boy.
We're a generation of men raised by women.
I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.
Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.
But every Saturday night, we were finding something out.
We were finding out more and more that we were not alone.
It used to be when I came home angry or depressed, I'd just clean my condo,
polish my Scandinavian furniture.
I should've been looking for a new condo, haggling with my insurance company.
I should have been upset about my nice flaming little shit - but I wasn't.
The premise of cybernetting an office is make things more efficient.
Monday mornings, all I thought about was next week.
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
Absolutely.
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.
Because waste is a thief.
I showed this to my man here. You liked it, didn't you?
You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.
It was right in everyone's face. Tyler and I just made it visible.
It was on the tip of everyone's tongue. Tyler and I just gave it a name.
Come on, people, you've gotta go home!
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.
Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.
Gentlemen!
Welcome to Fight Club.
The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club.
The second rule of Fight Club is...
you do not talk about Fight Club!
Third rule of Fight Club: someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,
the fight is over.
Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight.
Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas.
Sixth rule: no shirts, no shoes.
Seventh rule: fights will go on as long as they have to.
And the eighth and final rule: if this is your first night, you have to fight.
This kid from work, Ricky,
couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black.
Ricky was a god for ten minutes when he trounced the maitre d' of a food court.
Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat, hard packing sounds over the yelling.
Or the wet choke when someone gasped and sprayed...
Stop!
You weren't alive anywhere like you were there.
But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and ends.
Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight, I wouldn't be talking to the same man.
Who you were in Fight Club is not who you were in the rest of the world.
A guy came to Fight Club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
If you could fight any celebrity, who would you fight?
- Alive or dead? - Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
Hemingway. You?
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
We all started seeing things differently.
Everywhere we went, we were sizing things up.
I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,
trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.
Is that what a man looks like?
Ah, self-improvement is masturbation.
Now, self-destruction...
Excuse me.
Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.
It wasn't about words.
The hysterical shouting was in tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.
- Is that it? - Stop!
When the fight was over, nothing was solved.
But nothing mattered.
Cool.
Afterwards, we all felt saved.
Hey, man. How about next week?
How about next month?
Irvine, you're in the middle. New guy, you too.
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.
He fell down some stairs.
I fell down some stairs.
Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails.
OK. Any historical figure.
- I'd fight Gandhi. - Good answer.
- How about you? - Lincoln.
- Lincoln? - Mm-hm.
Big guy, big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Fuck!
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.
- Hello? - Where've you been the last eight weeks?
Marla?
- How did you find me? - You left a forwarding number.
I haven't seen you at any support groups.
We split 'em up. That was the idea. Remember?
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.
- How do you know? - I cheated.
I found a new one.
- Really? - It's for men only.
Like the testicle thing?
Wah!
- Look, this is a bad time. - I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.
- Some really fucked-up people. - I'm on my way out.
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.
I took what was left of a bottle. It might have been too much.
Picture Marla Singer throwing herself around her crummy apartment.
This isn't a for-real suicide. It's probably a cry for help.
This could go on for hours.
- So you're staying in tonight? - Do you wanna hear me describe death?
Do you wanna listen and see if my spirit can use a phone?
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for two months, his door was never closed.
- You won't believe the dream I had last night. - I hardly believe anything from last night.
What are you doing here?
- What? - This is my house. What're you doing here?
Fuck you!
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!
Limber, though. Silly cooze.
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook. Guess who's on the other end.
I knew the story before he told me.
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
Do you think it'll live up to its name?
Or will it just be a death hairball?
Prepare to evacuate soul.
Ten, nine, eight...
How could Tyler, of all people, think it was a bad thing
that Marla Singer was about to die?
..five, four, three...
Hang on.
You got here fast.
Did I call you?
Huh?
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.
Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.
Oh, fuck! Somebody called the cops.
- Hey, where's 513? - End of the hall.
The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl.
She has lost faith in herself.
- Miss Singer, let us help you! - She's a monster!
- You have every reason to live. - She's infectious human waste!
- Miss Singer! - Good luck trying to save her!
If I fall asleep, I'm done for.
You're gonna have to keep me up...
all night.
Un-fucking-believable.
He was obviously able to handle it.
- You know what I mean. You fucked her. - No, I didn't.
- Never? - No.
- You're not into her, are you? - No! God, not at all.
I am Jack's raging bile duct.
- Are you sure? You can tell me. - Believe me, I'm sure.
- Put a gun to my head, spray my brains. - That's good.
She's a predator posing as a house pet. Stay away from that one.
The shit that came out of this woman's mouth, I had never heard!
My God.
I haven't been fucked like that since grade school.
- Eugh! - How could Tyler not go for that?
The other night, he was splicing sex organs into "Cinderella".
Marla doesn't need a lover, just a caseworker.
And a wash. This isn't love, it's sport fucking.
She invaded my support groups and now my home.
Hey, hey. Sit down.
- I can't have you talking to her about me. - Why would I talk to her?
You say anything about me or what goes on in this house to anybody, we're done.
- Now, promise me. - OK.
- You promise? - I promise.
- Promise. - I just said, I promise! What...
That's three times you promised.
If only I had wasted a couple of minutes and gone to watch Marla Singer die,
none of this would've happened.
Yes! Oh, harder, harder!
I could have moved to another room.
On the third floor where I might not have heard them.
But I didn't.
Ow!
- What are you doing? - Just going to bed.
- You wanna finish her off? - Ooh!
- No. No, thank you. - I found the cigarettes.
- Who were you talking to? - Shut up.
I became the calm little center of the world.
I was the Zen master.
I wrote little haiku poems.
I emailed them to everyone.
Is that your blood?
Some of it, yeah.
You can't smoke in here.
Take the rest of the day off. Come back Monday with clean clothes.
Get yourself together.
I got right in everyone's hostile face. "Yes, these are bruises from fighting."
"Yes, I'm comfortable with that. I am enlightened."
You give up the condo life and all your flaming worldly possessions,
go live in a dilapidated house in a toxic-waste part of town,
and you have to come home to this.
- Hello? - This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.
We have new information about the incident at your former condo.
- Yes? - I don't know if you're aware,
but someone sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.
They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
- No, I wasn't aware of that. - I am Jack's cold sweat.
- Does this sound strange to you? - Yes, sir. Very strange.
- The dynamite... - Dynamite?
..left a residue of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.
- Do you know what this means? - No. What does it mean?
It means it was home-made.
I'm sorry. This is just coming as quite a shock to me, sir.
Whoever set this dynamite could've blown your pilot light days before the explosion.
- The gas was just a detonator. - Who'd do such a thing?
- I'll ask the questions. - Tell him.
"The liberator who destroyed my property realigned my perceptions."
- Excuse me. Are you there? - Yes. Hard to know what to make of this.
Have you recently made enemies who might have access to home-made dynamite?
- Enemies? - "I reject civilization,
especially material possessions."
- Son, this is serious. - Yes, I know it's serious.
- I mean that. - Yes, it's very serious.
Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me. That condo was my life. OK?
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.
That was not just a bunch of stuff that got destroyed.
- It was me! - I thank the Academy.
- Is this not a good time for you? - Just tell him you fucking did it!
Tell him you blew it all up! That's what he wants to hear.
- Are you still there? - Are you saying that I'm a suspect?
No. I may need to talk to you, so you let me know if you're gonna leave town.
- OK? - OK.
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
My parents pulled this exact same act for years.
The condom is the glass slipper of our generation.
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.
You dance all night, then you throw it away.
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
What?
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.
It was worth every penny.
It's a bridesmaid's dress.
Someone loved it intensely for one day,
then tossed it.
Like a Christmas tree.
So special.
Then... bam!
It's on the side of the road.
Tinsel still clinging to it.
Like a sex-crime victim, underwear inside out, bound with electrical tape.
Well, then, it suits you.
You can borrow it sometime.
Get rid of her.
- What? You get rid of her! - Don't mention me.
I am six years old again, passing messages between parents.
- It's time you left. - Don't worry, I'm leaving.
- Not that we don't love your visits. - You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.
Thanks. Bye.
You kids!
Why do you still waste time with her?
I'll say this about Marla. At least she's trying to hit bottom.
And I'm not?
Sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken.
What are we doing tonight?
Tonight... we make soap.
- Really? - To make soap, first we render fat.
The salt balance has to be just right, the best fat for soap comes from humans.
- Wait. What is this place? - A liposuction clinic.
Aha! Pay dirt!
Richest, creamiest fat in the world. The fat of the land!
No! Don't pull it.
- Oh, God! - I'll get another one.
As the fat renders, the tallows float to the surface. Like in Boy Scouts.
- It's hard to imagine you a Boy Scout. - Keep stirring.
Once the tallow hardens, you skim off a layer of glycerin.
Add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.
If you then add sodium nitrate and sawdust, you got dynamite.
With enough soap, one could blow up anything.
Tyler was full of useful information.
Ancient peoples found clothes got cleaner when washed in one part of the river.
- You know why? - No.
Humans were once sacrificed on the hills above.
Bodies burnt, water seeped through the ashes to create lye.
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.
Once it mixed with the melted body fat, a soapy discharge crept into the river.
May I see your hand, please?
What is this?
- This is a chemical burn. - Agh! Aaagh!
It'll hurt more than you've ever been burned and leave a scar.
If meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
- Don't shut the pain out. - Oh, God!
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes, like the first monkey shot into space.
Without pain or sacrifice, we would have nothing.
I tried not to think of the words "searing" or "flesh".
Stop it! This is your pain, this is your burning hand.
I'm going to my cave to find my power animal.
No! Don't deal with this the way those dead people do! Come on!
- I get the point! - No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.
It's the greatest moment of your life, and you're missing it!
I am not...
Shut up! Our fathers were our models for God.
If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God?
Listen to me. You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you.
He never wanted you. In all probability, he hates you.
This is not the worst thing that can happen. We don't need him!
- I agree! - Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!
- I'm getting water! - You can use water and make it worse or...
Look at me!
- ..or use vinegar to neutralize the burn. - Please let me up!
First, you have to give up.
First, you have to know - not fear -
know that someday, you're gonna die.
You don't know how this feels!
It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.
OK.
Congratulations. You're one step closer to hitting bottom.
Tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar. God knows what they charged.
- This is the best soap. - Why, thank you, Susan.
It was beautiful.
We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.
He was wearing his yellow tie.
I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore.
"The first rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club"?
I'm half-asleep again. I must have left it in the copy machine.
"The second rule..." Is this yours?
Huh?
Pretend you're me. Make a managerial decision.
You find this. What would you do?
Well, I gotta tell you,
I'd be very, very careful who you talk to about that.
Because the person who wrote that is dangerous.
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho might just snap
and then stalk from office to office
with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered semiautomatic weapon,
pumping round after round into colleagues and co-workers.
This might be someone you've known for years.
Someone very, very close to you.
Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.
And I used to be such a nice guy.
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me every piece of trash you pick up.
- Compliance and Liability. - My tit's gonna rot off.
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.
- What do you mean? - I need you to check for a lump in my breast.
- Go to a hospital. - I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.
I don't know about this, Marla.
Please?
She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.
That's nice. Taking food to Mrs... Haniver and Mrs. Raines.
Where are they, exactly?
Tragically, they're dead. I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?
- No, no. - I got one for you.
Thanks for the thought.
What happened to your hand?
Oh, nothing.
- Right there? - Mm.
- Feel anything? - No.
Well, make sure.
- OK, I'm pretty sure. - You feel nothing?
No, nothing.
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
- No problem. - I wish I could return the favor.
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.
- I could check your prostate. - I think I'm OK.
Well, thanks, anyway.
- Are we done? - Yeah, we're done.
See you... around.
Cornelius?
Cornelius!
It's me! Bob!
Hey, Bob.
- We all thought you were dead. - No, no. Still here.
- How are you, Bob? - Better than I've been in my whole life.
- Really? Still Remaining Men Together? - No. I got something much better now.
Really? What is it?
Well...
The first rule is, I'm not supposed to talk about it.
And the second rule is...
I'm not supposed to talk about it.
- And the third rule is... - Bob, Bob. I'm a member.
Look at my face, Bob.
That's fucking great.
- I've never seen you there. - I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- I go Saturday. - Congratulations.
Yeah. Hey, to both of us, right?
Have you heard about the guy that invented it?
- Yeah, actually... - I hear all kinds of things.
Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution
and he sleeps only one hour a night.
- He's a great man. - Oh...
Do you know about Tyler Durden?
I didn't hurt you, did I?
Actually, you did.
Thank you for this. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Fight Club.
This was mine and Tyler's gift.
Our gift to the world.
I look around, I look around, I see a lot of new faces.
Shut up!
Which means a lot of people have been breaking the first rules of Fight Club.
I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived.
I see all this potential. And I see it squandered.
Goddammit, an entire generation pumping gas,
or waiting tables.
Slaves with white collars.
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes,
working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need.
We're the middle children of history, men. No purpose or place.
We have no Great War,
no Great Depression.
Our great war is a spiritual war.
Our great depression is our lives.
We've all been raised on TV to believe that one day we'd be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars.
But we won't.
We're slowly learning that fact.
And we're very, very pissed off.
Yeah!
First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...
Who are you?
- Who am I? - Yeah.
There's a sign on the front that says Lou's Tavern.
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?
Tyler Durden.
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone. He don't own this place. I do.
- How much money does he get? - There is no money.
- Really? - Free to all.
- Ain't that something. - It is, actually.
Look, stupid fuck!
- I want everybody out of here right now. - Hey! You should join our club.
- Did you hear what I just said? - You and your friend.
You hear me now?
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.
Still not getting it.
Agh! OK, OK, I got it.
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.
Back! All of you!
Everybody back!
Ah, Lou!
Come on, man! We really like this place.
- That's right, Lou. Get it out. - Shut the fuck up.
Oh, yeah!
Is that fucking funny?
Fucking guy's a loony, I'm telling you.
Unbelievable.
- You don't know where I've been, Lou. - Oh, my God!
You don't know where I've been!
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!
- Fucking use the basement! Christ! - I want your word! I want your word!
On my mother's eyes.
Thanks, Lou.
You too, big guy.
We'll see you next week.
This week, each one of you has a homework assignment.
You're gonna go out. You're gonna start a fight with a total stranger.
You're gonna start a fight,
and you're gonna lose.
Excellent choice, sir.
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!
Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.
What... Son of a bitch!
Most people - normal people - do just about anything to avoid a fight.
Excuse me!
You sprayed me with your hose.
That's not necessary.
Jay! Go call 911!
Put the hose down.
Stop it! Stop it!
Sorry.
You bastard!
We need to talk.
OK.
Where to begin?
With your constant absenteeism?
With your unpresentable appearance?
- You're up for review. - I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
- What? - Let's pretend.
You're the Department of Transportation, OK?
Someone informs you that this company installs front-seat mounting brackets
that never pass collision tests,
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,
and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive.
What then?
- Are you threatening me? - No...
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired! - I have a better solution.
Keep me on the payroll as an outside consultant
in exchange for my salary, my job will be never to tell people things that I know.
I don't even have to come into the office. I can do this job from home.
Who... who the fuck do you think you are, you crazy little shit?
- Security! - I am Jack's smirking revenge.
Agh!
What the hell are you doing?
That hurt.
Why would you do that?
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!
What are you doing?
Oh, God, no! Please! No!
For some reason, I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.
No!
Under and behind and inside everything this man took for granted,
something horrible had been growing.
Look. Just give me the paychecks, like I asked, and you won't ever see me again.
And right then, at our most excellent moment together...
Thank God! Please don't hit me again.
Telephone, computer, fax, 52 weekly paychecks and 48 airline flight coupons.
We now had corporate sponsorship.
This is how Tyler and I were able to have Fight Club every night of the week.
Now, nobody was the center of Fight Club except the two men fighting.
The leader walked through the crowd, out in the darkness.
Tyler was now involved in a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel
over the urine content of their soup.
I am Jack's wasted life.
Thank you, sir.
Tyler dreamed up new homework assignments.
He handed them out in sealed envelopes.
- There's a Fight Club in Delaware City. - Yeah, I heard.
There's one in Penns Grove, too. Bob even found one up in New Castle.
- Did you start that one? - No, I thought you did.
No.
- Stop. - What are we doing?
- Turn around. - What are we doing?
- Homework assignment. - What kind?
Human sacrifice.
- Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not. - It's a gun. Meet me in the back.
- Don't fuck around! - Meet me in the back.
On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
- Stop. What are you doing? - Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.
Raymond K Hessel. 1320 SE Banning, Apartment A. Cramped basement apartment?
- How did you know? - They give shitty apartments letters.
Raymond! You're going to die.
No!
Is that your mom and dad? They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor.
Pick up your dental records. Know why?
- There'll be nothing left of your face. - Come on!
An expired community college student ID. What did you study, Raymond?
- S-Stuff. - Stuff?
Were the midterms hard?
- I asked you what you studied! - Biology, mostly.
- Why? - I don't know.
What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?
The question, Raymond, was: what did you want to be?
Answer him, Raymond! Jesus!
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian. - Animals.
- Yeah. Animals and stuff. - Stuff. Yeah, I got that.
- So you need more schooling. - Too much school.
- Would you rather be dead? - No, please...
You'd rather die here, on your knees, in the back of a convenience store?
No. Please, no.
I'm keeping your license.
Gonna check in on you. I know where you live.
If you're not on your way to being a veterinarian in six weeks, you will be dead.
Now, run on home.
Run, Forrest, run!
I feel ill.
- Imagine how he feels. - Come on, this isn't funny!
What the fuck was the point of that?
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K Hessel's life.
His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I have ever tasted.
You had to give it to him.
- Come on. - He had a plan.
And it started to make sense in a Tyler sort of way.
No fear. No distractions.
The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide.
You are not your job.
You're not how much money you have in the bank.
You're not the car you drive.
You're not the contents of your wallet.
You're not your fucking khakis.
You are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.
I'll be out of your way in a sec.
You don't have to go.
Whatever.
No, I mean... It's OK.
Are you still going to groups?
Yeah.
Chloe's dead.
Wow. Chloe.
When did that happen?
Do you care?
I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while.
Yeah, well...
It was the smart move on her part.
Listen, um...
What are you getting out of all this?
What?
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...?
Is this making you happy?
Yeah, well, sometimes.
I don't know. I don't understand.
Why does a weaker person need to latch on to a strong person? What is that?
What do you get out of it?
No... That's not the same thing at all. It's totally different with us.
"Us"?
- What do you mean by "us"? - I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
- Hear what? - All that noise. Hold on.
No, wait! Don't change the subject! I want to talk about this.
- You're not talking about me, are you? - No.
- What? - You playing doctor. What was going on?
- What are you talking about? - Nothing. Nothing.
- I don't think so. - What do you want?
- Look at me. - No. What?
- What is that? - It's nothing. Don't worry.
- My God. Who did this? - A person.
Guy or girl?
- What do you care? - What do you care if I ask?
- Leave me alone. - You're afraid to say.
- I am not. Let me go. - No! Talk to me.
Let go of me. Leave me alone!
- This conversation... - This conversation...
- ..is over. - ..is over.
I just can't win with you, can I?
Hey, this is getting a little old!
What is... what is all this?
What do you think?
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?
Hey!
Too young. Sorry.
What's all that?
Tell the applicant if he's too young, too old or too fat.
Applicant?
If the applicant waits three days without food or shelter, he may enter and begin training.
Training for what?
You think this is a game? You're too young to train here, end of story.
Quit wasting our time. Get the fuck out of here.
Bad news, friend.
It's not gonna happen.
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
It's not the end of the world. Just... go away.
Go.
You're trespassing and I will have to call the police.
Don't you look at me! You're never getting in this fucking house!
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch! Get off my porch!
Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.
I'm gonna go inside and I'm gonna get a shovel.
Got two black shirts? Two pair of black pants?
- Yes, sir. - One pair black boots? Black socks?
- Sir. - One black jacket?
- Sir. - $300 personal burial money?
Yes, sir.
All right.
You're too old, fat man.
Your tits are too big. Get the fuck off my porch.
Bob! Bob!
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.
Space monkey.
Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good.
You are too fucking old, fatty!
And you... You're too fucking blond!
Get out of here, the both of you!
And so it went.
Listen up, maggots.
You are not special.
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.
You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else.
Tyler built himself an army.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.
We are all part of the same compost heap.
Why was Tyler Durden building an army?
To what purpose? For what greater good?
In Tyler we trusted.
No, no, no, no. When he was, like, "You are not your job," I was, like, "Yeah!"
- Hey, what's all this? - Hey!
OK!
- What's going on? - We're celebrating.
- What are we celebrating? - Go on.
- Hey. - Let me get that for you.
Same great taste. Pepsi. Generation Next.
Shh!
Investigators are on the scene. The police commissioner has arrived.
Could you tell us what you think has happened here?
We believe this is one of many recent acts of vandalism around the city
somehow related to underground boxing clubs.
We will be coordinating a rigorous investigation.
That was Commissioner Jacobs who just arrived on the scene
- of a four-alarm fire that broke out... - She's hot.
Back to you in the studio.
- Yeah! - Yeah!
- Holy shit! - Yeah!
What the fuck did you guys do?
Arson investigators are on the premises...
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions, sir.
Police Commissioner Jacobs is on the scene...
The victory in the war against crime will not come overnight.
It will take dedication and commitment and, most of all, cooperation.
Streets are safer now. There is hope in the inner city.
- However... - I gotta take a piss.
These are the first steps in a long journey. That is why we created Project Hope...
Bob.
..helping others with prevention and enforcement.
Project Hope'll be a joint effort between the police and community leaders.
It will be a powerful new weapon in the war against crime.
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack. - Man! His balls are ice-cold.
Hi. You're gonna call off your rigorous investigation.
You will publicly state there is no underground group,
or these guys are gonna take your balls.
They'll send one to the New York Times and one to the LA Times.
Look, the people you are after are the people you depend on.
We cook your meals. We haul your trash. We connect your calls.
We drive your ambulances. We guard you while you sleep.
Do not fuck with us.
Ball check!
Bob, this way.
Let's go.
I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.
Hey!
Yeah!
I felt like putting a bullet in every panda that wouldn't screw to save its species.
I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers
and smother all those French beaches I'd never see.
I wanted to breathe smoke.
Where did you go, psycho boy?
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
- Get him to a fucking hospital. - Yeah.
Don't worry, Mr. Durden. Airport parking. Long term.
After you, Mr. Durden.
After you.
- Something on your mind, dear? - No.
Yeah. Why wasn't I told about Project Mayhem?
First rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions.
- Why wasn't I included in the beginning? - Fight Club was the beginning.
Now it's left the basements and it's Project Mayhem.
We started Fight Club together. Remember? It's as much mine as it is yours.
- Is this about you and me? - Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?
This does not belong to us.
- We are not special. - Fuck that. You should have told me.
Hey, Tyler!
- Goddammit, Tyler! - What do you want?
A statement of purpose? Should I email you?
- Look... - You decide your level of involvement!
I will! I wanna know certain things first!
- The first rule of Project Mayhem... - Shut up!
- I wanna know what you're thinking. - Fuck what you know!
Forget about what you think you know about life, friendship,
and especially about you and me.
What is that supposed to mean? What...?
What are you doing?
What'll you wish you'd done before you die?
- Paint a self-portrait. - Build a house.
- And you? - I don't know. Nothing.
- Get in the right lane. - You have to know!
If you died now, how would you feel about your life?
I don't know! Nothing good. Is that what you want to hear me say?
- Come on! - Not good enough.
Stop fucking around! Tyler!
Jesus Christ!
Goddammit! Goddammit! Fuck you!
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla! I am sick of all your shit!
OK, man. OK.
- Quit screwing around. Steer! - Look at you!
- Steer! - Look at you! You're fucking pathetic!
- Why? What are you talking about? - Why'd you think I blew up your condo?
What?
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat. It's not a goddamn seminar.
Stop trying to control everything and just let go!
- Let go! - All right. Fine.
Fine.
I'd never been in a car accident.
This must have been what all those people felt like
before I filed them as statistics in my reports.
Goddamn!
We've just had a near-life experience!
In the world I see, you're stalking elk through the damp canyon forests
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.
You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life.
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower.
And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,
laying strips of venison in the empty car-pool lane of some abandoned superhighway.
Feel better, champ.
And then...
Tyler?
..Tyler was gone.
Was I asleep?
Had I slept?
You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...
The house had become a living thing,
wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing.
- We're all part of the same compost heap... - So many people moving, the house moved.
Planet Tyler.
I had to hug the walls, trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys.
You can't be smoking! You know how much ether is in here?
Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.
Hang on a second.
It's under control, sir.
Where's Tyler?
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not...
Right. OK.
I'm all alone.
My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.
I am Jack's broken heart.
What comes next in Project Mayhem, only Tyler knows.
The second rule is you do not ask questions.
Get the fuck away from me! Get the fuck away!
Who are all these people?
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
What?
Tyler isn't here.
Tyler went away.
Tyler's gone.
Jesus! Get some help!
Two gunshot wounds coming through! Make some fucking room!
What happened? What happened?
We were on assignment. We were supposed to kill two birds with one stone.
Destroy a piece of corporate art...
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.
We had it all worked out, sir.
- It went smooth until... - Police! Freeze!
- What? - They shot Bob.
- They shot him in the head. - Fucking pigs!
Oh, God!
- Those motherfuckers! - You morons.
You run around in ski masks trying to blow things up?
What did you think was gonna happen?
OK, quick! We gotta get rid of the evidence - this body!
- Bury him. - What?
Take him to the garden and bury him.
- Come on, people, let's go! - Get the fuck off! Get away from him!
What are you talking about? This isn't fucking evidence. This is a person.
He's my friend and you're not burying him in the garden!
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.
- This is Bob. - But, sir, in...
in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
You listen to me. This is a man and he has a name, it's Robert Paulsen, OK?
Robert Paulsen?
He's a man, and he's dead now because of us. Do you understand that?
I understand.
In death, a member of Project Mayhem has a name.
His name is Robert Paulsen.
His name is Robert Paulsen.
His name... is Robert Paulsen.
His name is Robert Paulsen.
- Come on, guys. Please. Stop it. - His name is Robert Paulsen.
Shut up! This is all over with!
- Tyler? - No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.
I need to see you...
I went to all the cities on Tyler's used ticket stubs, bar-hopping.
I didn't know how, but I could look at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.
I'm looking for Tyler Durden. It's very important that I talk to him.
I wish I could help you,
sir.
Every city I went to,
as soon as I set foot off the plane,
I knew a Fight Club was close.
Hey! Hey!
Taxi!
Look at my face. I'm a member. Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.
I'm not exposed to bespeak any such information to you,
nor would I, even if I had said information at this juncture, be able.
- You're a moron. - I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Tyler had been busy, setting up franchises all over the country.
Was I asleep? Had I slept?
Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?
- We've just heard the stories. - What stories?
- Nobody knows what he looks like. - He has plastic surgery every three years.
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami? - Is Mr. Durden building an army?
I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.
Everywhere I went, I felt I'd already been there.
It was like following an invisible man.
The smell of dried blood.
Dirty, bare footprints circling each other.
That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.
The feel of a floor still warm from a fight the night before.
I was always just one step behind Tyler.
His name is Robert Paulsen. His name is Robert Paulsen. His...
Welcome back, sir.
How have you been?
Do you know me?
- Is this a test, sir? - No. This is not a test.
You were in here last Thursday.
Thursday?
You were standing where you are now, asking how good security is.
It's tight as a drum, sir.
Who do you think I am?
- Are you sure this isn't a test? - No, this is not a test.
You're Mr. Durden.
You're the one who gave me this.
Please return your seat backs to their full upright and locked position.
- Yeah? - Marla, it's me.
- Have we ever done it? - Done what?
- Had sex. - What kind of stupid question is that?
Stupid because the answer's yes or because it's no?
- Is this a trick? - No. I need to know...
You wanna know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
- We did make love? - Is that what you're calling it?
Just answer the question! Did we do it or not?
You fuck me, then snub me. You love me, you hate me.
You're sensitive, then you turn into an asshole.
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?
We have just lost cabin pressure.
- What did you say? - What is wrong with you?
- Say my name! - Tyler Durden.
Tyler Durden, you fucking freak! What's going on?
- I'm coming over! - I'm not there!
You broke your promise.
- Jesus, Tyler. - You talked to her about me.
- What the fuck is going on? - I ask you for one thing. One thing.
Why do people think that I'm you?
Answer me!
Sit.
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?
I think you know.
- No, I don't. - Yes, you do.
Why would anyone possibly confuse you with me?
I... I don't know.
- You got it. - No.
- Do not fuck with us! - Say it.
Because...
Say it!
Because we're the same person.
That's right.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing...
- I don't understand this. - You wanted a way to change your life.
You could not do this on your own.
All the ways you wish you could be - that's me.
I look like you wanna look, fuck like you wanna fuck,
I am smart, capable, most importantly, I'm free in all the ways that you are not.
Oh, no.
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away. - What?
- This is impossible. This is crazy. - People do it every day.
They talk to themselves. They see themselves as they'd like to be.
They don't have the courage you have to just run with it.
You still wrestle with it, so sometimes you're still you.
We should do this again sometime.
Other times, you imagine you're watching me.
If this is your first time, you have to fight.
Little by little, you're just letting yourself become...
Tyler Durden.
You are not your job or how much money you have!
- No. You have a house. - Rented in your name.
- You have jobs, a life. - You work nights because you can't sleep.
- Or you stay up and make soap. - You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
Technically, you are. But it's all the same to her.
Oh, my God.
Now you see our dilemma.
She knows too much.
I think we're gonna have to talk about how this might compromise our goals.
What... what are you saying?
This is bullshit. This is bullshit! I'm not listening to this.
- You are insane! - No. You're insane.
And we simply do not have time for this crap.
It's called a changeover. The movie goes on, nobody in the audience has any idea.
- Sir! Are you checking out? - Yeah. Bill me.
I need you to initial this list of phone calls, please.
- When were these made? - Between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.
Have I been going to bed earlier every night? Have I been sleeping later?
Have I been Tyler longer and longer?
Is anybody here?
Déjà vu, all over again.
With enough soap, one could blow up anything.
Oh, my God.
- 1888. - Who am I calling?
1888 Franklin. This is Maintenance.
Hello? Hello?
1888 Franklin Street?
Yes. Can I help you?
- Hello? - Yeah, yeah.
I need to talk to your supervisor right away.
- Speaking. - OK, listen to me.
Something terrible is about to happen to your building.
It's under control, sir.
- Excuse me? - Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom! They almost broke my arm!
They were burning their fingertips with lye.
It'll take a tremendous act of faith on your part, but hear me out.
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit. - A little more faith than that.
- I don't wanna hear anything you have to say. - You have every right to be...
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.
Sir, anything you order is free of charge, sir.
- Why is it free of charge? - Don't ask.
Whatever.
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken, a baked potato, chocolate chiffon pie.
Clean food, please.
In that case, sir, I advise against the clam chowder.
No clam chowder. Thank you.
You got about 30 seconds.
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?
- I know it seems there's two sides to me... - Two sides? You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.
I deserved that. But I realized something important.
What?
The full extent of our relationship wasn't clear to me until now, for reasons I won't go into.
- I know I haven't treated you well. - Whatever.
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please! Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.
What I've come to realize is that I really like you, Marla.
- You do? - I really do.
I care about you, I don't want anything bad to happen to you because of me.
Your life is in danger.
- What? - You need to leave town for a while.
- Get out of any major city. Go camping... - You're an insane person.
- I've involved you in something terrible. - No. Shut up!
- You're not safe. - Shut up!
- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried. - I know you did.
There are things about you I like. You're smart, funny, spectacular in bed.
But... you're intolerable.
You have very serious emotional problems for which you should seek professional help.
- I know, and I'm sorry. - You're sorry, I'm sorry, everyone's sorry.
I can't do this anymore.
I can't. I won't.
- I'm gone. - You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!
- Marla, you don't understand! - Leave me alone!
I am trying to protect you!
- I never want to see you again! - If that's what it takes...
Wait right here.
Hold it right there! Shut up!
Take this money and get on this bus. I promise I will never bother you again.
Shut up!
Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.
- Why are you doing this? - They think you're a threat.
I can't explain now. Trust me. If I see where you're going, you won't be safe.
I'm not paying this back. I consider it asshole tax.
Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities for a couple of days, OK?
Tyler...
You're the worst thing that ever happened to me.
Hello. I need you to arrest me.
I am the leader of a terrorist organization
responsible for numerous acts of vandalism and assault all over this city.
In the metropolitan area, we had probably 200 members.
Chapters have sprung up in five or six other major cities already.
This is a tightly regimented organization
with many cells capable of operating independent of central leadership.
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street. That's our headquarters.
In the back, buried in the garden, you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.
In the basement, you'll find bathtubs
that have been used very recently to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
I believe the plan is to blow up the headquarters of these credit-card companies
and the TRW building.
Why these buildings? Why credit-card companies?
If you erase the debt record, then we all go back to zero.
You'll create total chaos.
Keep him talking. I need to make a phone call.
I really admire what you're doing.
- What? - You're a brave man to order this.
You're a genius, sir.
You said if anyone ever interferes with Project Mayhem, even you,
we gotta get his balls.
- Don't fight. - It's a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.
- It'll set quite an example. - You're making a big mistake!
- You said you'd say that. - I'm not Tyler Durden!
You told us you'd say that too.
All right. I am Tyler Durden.
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order. We're aborting this mission now.
You said you would definitely say that.
Let me go!
Are you fucking out of your minds? You're police officers!
Is somebody timing this?
Keep your mouth shut.
Shit!
- Some of this information checks out. - Uh-huh?
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street. - Be right there.
Hey, wait!
- Got him? - I got him.
Sir, we have to do this.
- Stop fighting! - Where's the rubber band?
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!
Get down on the floor!
First person that comes out this door gets a lead salad! Understand?
Get away! Stay away!
I ran.
I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid.
Then I ran some more.
What are you doing, running around in your underpants? You look crazy!
No. I'm onto you. I know what's going on here.
Come on, then. I got us a great place to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.
Oh, Christ.
Now what are you doing?
- I'm stopping this. - Why?
- The greatest thing you've ever done. - I can't let this happen.
There are 10 other bombs in 10 other buildings.
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
The buildings are empty. We're not killing anyone. We're setting 'em free!
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.
You wanna make an omelet, you gotta break eggs.
I'm not listening to you. You're not even there.
Wouldn't do that. Not unless I knew which wires were what.
If you know, then I know.
Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent all day thinking about the wrong ones.
You think?
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.
Pull any one but the green one.
I asked you not to do that!
Fuck!
Tyler, get away from the van.
Tyler, I'm not kidding! Get away from the van!
Goddammit!
Whoa! Whoa!
OK.
You are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
Cool it, Tyler!
Aw, come on! Don't go!
What?
Three minutes. This is it.
The beginning.
Ground zero.
- I think this is about where we came in. - Want to say a few words for the occasion?
I'm sorry?
I still can't think of anything.
Ah. Flashback humor.
It's getting exciting now.
Two and a half. Think of everything we've accomplished.
Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history.
One step closer to economic equilibrium.
- Why is she here? - I'm tying up loose ends.
Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!
- I'm begging you, please don't do this. - I'm not doing this. We are doing this.
- This is what we want. - No. I don't want this.
Right. Except "you" is meaningless now. We have to forget about you.
- You're a voice in my head. - You're a voice in mine!
You're a hallucination. Why can't I get rid of you?
- You need me. - No. I don't. I really don't any more.
You created me. I didn't create some loser alter ego to make me feel better.
- Take some responsibility. - I do.
I am responsible for all of it, and I accept that.
So, please, I'm begging you, please call this off.
Have I ever let us down?
How far have you come because of me?!
I will bring us through this.
As always, I will carry you kicking and screaming,
and in the end you will thank me.
Tyler. Tyler.
I'm grateful to you for everything that you've done for me.
But this is too much. I don't want this.
What do you want? Your shit job back? Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?
Fuck you! I won't do it.
- This can't be happening. - It's already done, so shut up!
- 60 seconds till CRI. - No.
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.
You're not real. That gun... that gun isn't even in your hand.
The gun's in my hand.
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?
Not my head, Tyler.
Our head.
Interesting.
Where are you going with this, IKEA boy?
Hey. It's you and me.
Friends?
Tyler,
I want you to really listen to me.
OK.
My eyes are open.
What's that smell?
- Where is everybody? - Oh, no. What's going on?
Mr. Durden!
Oh, my God!
Sir!
Are you... are you all right, sir?
- Oh, yeah, I'm OK. - You look terrible, sir. What happened?
- Oh, nothing. It's no problem. - No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.
- You look awful. You need assistance. - I'm fine.
Look, I'm fine. Everything's fine.
Ow! Stop it!
- Let her go. - Christ Almighty!
You!
Hi, Marla.
Leave her with me. I'll meet you downstairs.
- Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.
You fucker! What sick fucking game are you playing at, putting me on a...?
Oh, my God, your face!
Yeah, I know.
- What happened? - Don't ask.
- You're shot. - Yes, I'm shot.
Oh, my God.
- I can't believe he's standing. - Tough motherfucker.
Who did this?
I did, actually.
Find some gauze.
- You shot yourself? - Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.
I'm really OK.
The Yu Ling Lung and the Pei Ming Stance of the sect
can give one perpetual rejuvenation.
The head of Tin San Sect was Siu Yiu-tze. He had three juniors.
They were Mo Han-wan, Li Chou-shui, and her twin sister Li Chong-hoi.
Chou-shui and Chong-hoi fell for Siu Yiu-tze.
While Mo Han-wan treated Chong-hoi in a very different way.
Siu knew about Mo and Chou-shui's feelings,
so he left them behind
and lived in seclusion with Chong-hoi in Piu Miu Peak.
Unfortunately, he was poisoned by Ting Chun-chou who betrayed him.
Siu Yiu-tze was dying.
Sing-hoi, come and play this game.
If you can make it, I will give you my power.
Match my power with our treasure, Yu Ling Lung.
You'll be powerful enough to fight Li Chou-shui and Mo Han-wan.
And you can get rid of the traitor, Ting Chun-chou.
This war concerns the world of martial arts, be careful.
In this game, there are many dangerous traps.
It is Tin San Sect's treasure.
Sing-hoi, you can only break it if you have a peaceful and sound mind.
-In this game, -In this game, -there are too many changes. -there are too many changes.
-Charge! -Charge!
I wish to learn how it is changing.
-Kill the invader! -Kill the invader!
-Kill the over-confident man! -Kill the over-confident man!
-Kill those who won't surrender. -Kill those who won't surrender.
-Kill! -Kill!
Fine, let's see who will be killed.
It's no big deal!
Watch my stance!
Chop!
Chun-chou?
Master, I...
Evils will invade when your mind is not peaceful.
You are still unable to escape from Ting Chun-chou.
You can't get my power.
Forget it, take a rest.
Master, give me one more chance.
Master, give me one more chance.
Master...
Master.
Chong-hoi, I know that you are up there.
I've come specially to pick you up.
Chong-hoi!
You are not welcome here, go away!
Chong-hoi, it's me.
Mo Han-wan, leave.
Chong-hoi.
I've been searching for you all these years
just so that we can be together again.
Why do you care about what others think and hide alone?
Shut up!
Yiu-tze, how could you steal my love?
Mo Han-wan, you've gone too far!
My sister doesn't want to see you, that's why she's staying here.
Mo Han-wan, aren't you ashamed?
Li Chou-shui, this is none of your business!
This is the place of Tin San Sect is where I belong.
It is my business.
You brought the monsters of the 72 Caves to soil our place,
but I didn't blame you.
What nonsense are you talking about?
Nonsense, you say?
Long live the Heavenly Maiden!
Heavenly Maiden? Did you name yourself?
Yiu-tze, she doesn't respect you! She has named herself Heavenly Maiden.
Fakes are found everywhere.
Get lost!
Li Chou-shui, if you want to fight, then come.
Don't overestimate yourself.
Even if you could defeat me, can you defeat Yiu-tze?
Forget about getting back with my sister.
Stop trying to provoke us, let's just start our fight!
Break!
Do you think you're the only one who knows the Kiddy Stance?
You learned it secretly!
I am not that foolish!
Solar Maiden Stance!
Protected by Evil Spirit!
Stop it! How dare you cause trouble at my place?
-Save the Maiden. -Get lost!
Thank you for saving me.
Siu Yiu-tze,
you have the Pei Ming Stance, I can't defeat you.
We shall fight again in the future.
Chong-hoi.
Wait for me.
As long as I'm alive, don't worry, I will come here and save you.
Siu Yiu-tze, thank you for saving me.
My long journey here was worth it.
Shut up!
You're worse than Mo Han-wan for practicing the evil stance!
Leave right away or I'll ruin your kung fu!
How hard-hearted.
Siu Yiu-tze, you are heartless.
I will never forget this day.
My sister is no better than me!
I love her.
I'll never fall in love with another person.
I am so lucky to be loved by you both.
But it's unfortunate for you two.
The days in Piu Miu Peak are the happiest time in my life.
But we have to part with each other now.
Yiu-tze.
I can't restrain the poison any longer.
Yiu-tze,
I'll get you Yu Ling Lung so you can be reborn.
It's destined.
But I will keep my last breath.
I'm waiting for the one who is destined to get my powers.
If you see anyone with the other half of this Master Jade,
teach him the kung fu of our sect.
And ask him to kill Ting Chun-chou, the traitor.
I will do as you instructed.
Sing-hoi.
Yes, Master.
Set the board game again.
In half a year, announce my death to the public.
Then, wait for the destined man who will come to take my place.
Yes, Master.
Why do you want to eliminate our sect?
Kill those who don't submit.
Worship Sing Suk Sect, Master Ting Chun-chou is famous.
Worship Sing Suk Sect, Master Ting Chun-chou is famous.
Hand me the Sword Stance Scroll now!
You evils, we will kill you.
You aren't good enough to do so.
Where are you going?
Stop him!
Go now, I'll help you!
Where can you go?
Are you trying to distract us? Leave your bag behind!
-The Scroll of Seven Stars Sword? -Tze.
-Tai Hung. -Tze, did you get the Scroll?
What scroll?
I couldn't find it.
I think we're tricked.
This is outrageous!
Here comes Master Ting.
I am Tze.
I am Ching.
I am Tai Hung.
I am Li Ko.
I am Koo Tu.
-The elites of our sect are all here. -The elites of our sect are all here.
Welcome, Master.
I am delighted.
I finally killed that old jerk.
From this day on, Chuen Chun Sect will be under my command.
PAVILION OF HORIZON
Long live the Maiden.
Ting Chun-chou has eliminated Chuen Chun Sect.
Now, he is leading 3,000 of his disciples approaching Shaolin Temple.
The Taoists of Chuen Chun Sect are overrated.
How useless.
Did Ting Chun-chou's kung fu improve?
He's much stronger than when he attacked the 12 Caves.
He only took an hour to turn Master Sun Yong into ash.
The Melting Stance is just a basic trick of Tin San Sect.
Did he contact the Hawk Palace?
I am not sure, but I will find out shortly.
Be careful.
You'll be handsomely rewarded.
Thank you, Maiden.
I am the powerful martial world leader, Sing Suk Fairy.
How are you not kneeling to me?
That was fun!
It feels so good to be the boss.
Okay, let's try that again.
Ting Chun-chou, you old jerk,
how dare you not kneel to me?
Now, I want you to.
He's here to steal the Magic Wooden Tripod.
How could you? Do you really think that I'm blind?
Luckily, it's just me.
If Master Ting found out about this, you would be dead.
Tze.
I do this for our future.
lt is not wise to live under someone else's roof.
Let's master the Melting Stance.
And after we've stolen the Yi-kan Sutra from Shaolin when we attack it,
we'll be able to learn both powerful Stances.
We'll then be invincible.
Tai Hung, I will rely on you then.
Don't let me down, okay?
-Let's go. -Hurry.
Where are all of you going?
The Sing Suk Sect is coming, why don't you run for your life?
Hands off me!
There's nothing valuable.
I'll take the quilt then.
Master?
Master.
Why are you staying here and praying?
Yes.
Great, follow me.
Me? But...
What's your name?
I am Hui Chok.
This is destined.
During the last days of Shaolin Temple,
there was only one disciple named Hui who stayed behind.
We have nothing else left.
Thank God.
Master, why didn't you stop the monks from escaping?
Do you see a lot of people out there?
I think there are over a thousand people.
Wrong.
There are only two.
Two?
Observe with your heart.
One is fame, and the other is money.
No one can escape the temptation of being famous and rich.
What?
But monks should let go of fame and money.
They're here, please stop.
-Come and sit here. -What?
No, please.
This temple has survived for over a thousand years.
Up until today, it's very old.
I think we can't escape from the disaster brought by Ting Chun-chou.
If you can't defeat him, why don't you hide?
We can go into hiding and wait.
We may return when it's safe.
Are you telling me how to be a master?
I dare not.
I am too old to run away.
If I run away, I will be a laughing stock.
Is that why you won't leave?
Hide the Yi-kan Sutra in the Scripture Library.
Leave the mountain before dawn.
Then, take the jade buddha to look for Siu Yiu-tze at Piu Miu Peak.
Ask him to help you fight Ting Chun-chou.
Master, how can a dead person fight Ting Chun-chou?
It's destined, just do as I say.
Master, this is an important matter.
I'm just a junior here, I'm afraid...
Everything is destined.
I knew that you're destined to take this responsibility when I saw you.
Take good care of Yi-kan Sutra.
Be careful on your journey.
Master!
Master, Sing Suk Sect has arrived.
All the disciples have run away.
Only us, the weakest ones are left behind.
I am the youngest, let me go and face them.
Calm down.
Hui-chuk, go out and see how many people are there.
Yes, Master.
SHAOLIN TEMPLE
Shut up, or they will hear us.
-Master, there are... -Hui-chuk.
How many people are out there?
-There are two. -Two?
Great, we're saved!
Why did you say there are two when there are so many of them?
One is fame and one is money. You taught me that.
Take the Yi-kan Sutra and go hide in the Scripture Library.
Don't show yourself no matter what.
Yes.
HOUSE OF REALIZATION
How dare you create chaos at the temple?
How dare you not kneel to Master Ting?
You should be the one kneeling.
Ridiculous!
Steady Stance!
Be my follower!
Chasing the Moon Stance!
Get lost!
The Invincible Pole!
This is more invincible!
Melting Stance!
Amitābha.
Old monk,
Shaolin Temple will have to change its name today.
Call it the Shaolin Branch of Sing Suk Sect.
I want 70 percent of your income.
And I'll leave others to you.
Are you done with your nonsense?
Do you have the audacity to fight me?
It's time for me to do some exercise after a long time of rest.
Great, I will melt your bones.
I will give you my thanks.
I won't be suffering from arthritis during the rainy day anymore.
I will make your wish come true.
Holy Buddha!
Melting Stance!
Hold!
Old monk, you really are something.
I didn't expect to be defeated by you.
-Master! -Master!
But you'll die as you're hurt by Melting Stance.
-Master! -Master!
Worship Sing Suk Sect, Master Ting is great!
From now on, there will be no more Shaolin Temple.
Worship Sing Suk Sect, Master Ting is great.
BUDDHIST TEXT LIBRARY
-Hurry. -Stop fighting, hurry up.
Hurry.
How dare you not kneel to Master Ting.
I thought that these monks are good fighters.
I shouldn't have wasted my time to disguise myself.
Not this one. No!
Where is it?
Little monk, come out!
-Show yourself! Who are you? -I am the librarian, don't kill me.
-Give me that! -No.
Yi-kan Sutra?
Great.
It is in Sanskrit.
Little monk, since you are the librarian, you must know what's written here.
No, I just take care of the books, I am illiterate.
How can you arrange books if you are illiterate? Don't lie!
Yi-kan Sutra?
That's perfect.
I'm finally in luck.
Monk, did you attack us?
Tai Hung, I remember him. He is the Dark Faced Buddha.
Tze, what are you doing?
I'm cutting it off!
Why did you do that?
Tai Hung, chop off your leg too.
If the poison spreads all over your body, you'll die.
Chop off your legs now!
Stop hesitating!
Is it that serious?
Stop hesitating, just chop it!
Get him.
I was tricked?
Tai Hung, I really admire you.
You are so brave to have chopped your leg off.
But you betrayed Master Ting, he has asked me to keep an eye on you.
I will kill our traitor today!
However...
Well...
I love you and I can't kill you.
Tze, don't kill me. Let me go.
Don't worry. How about this?
Hand me the Magic Wooden Tripod so that I can return it to Master Ting.
You should hide for some time.
We will keep in touch in the future.
Take care, Tai Hung. See you.
-Follow me. -Where to?
Listen.
There, I've released you. Can you teach me Yi-kan Sutra now?
You are not the disciple of Shaolin, so you can't learn it.
That's simple.
I'II be your disciple.
That makes me a disciple of Shaolin. You may teach me then.
We don't accept female disciples.
Why is it so troublesome?
We monks should follow decent rules.
Well, if you break any of your rules, you can teach me then.
Okay, I'll make you break the rules.
-Open his mouth -Okay.
-Wider. -Yes.
Your lips are dirtied by the chicken leg, you've broken the rules.
Read it and teach me the kung fu.
I won't read it without the approval of my master.
You are so stubborn.
Hold the book.
Turn the pages for him.
You've broken another rule after reading Yik-kan Sutra.
Continue.
I'm not doing this out of my own will.
I'm being forced by you.
Well, I will make you read it yourself.
You haven't eaten anything for days.
If you go on starving yourself, you will die soon.
Come on.
These are vegetables, it's true.
Stop making fun of me.
I didn't offend you.
Let me go, let me go.
I'm not lying.
I can't believe I'll meet someone more stubborn than I am.
I surrender.
Don't you know you're also breaking the rule if you don't eat?
If you don't eat, you will die sooner or later.
You are killing yourself and that is breaking the rules too.
Do you get what I mean?
I believe you.
You do? Then eat now.
Here.
Is it delicious?
Miss.
I have something to tell you.
I am Tze, what's your name?
I am Hui-chuk.
It means "empty bamboo." The name fits you.
Ms. Tze,
you are not that bad.
Why did you join Sing Suk Sect and do bad things?
Stupid monk, don't get over your head.
How dare you blame me just because I'm being a little nicer?
You monks always claim that you believe in Buddha.
If there are no bad guys like us,
will others believe in you?
Without misfortune, evils, or disasters,
will people burn incense?
Without evil, there will be no Buddha, do you get it?
There will be no Buddha without evil? It's too hard to understand.
Martial Aunt.
This is the observatory machine of Chuen Chun Sect.
It allows you to observe the change of weather.
I'll give it to you as a present.
My senior is too foolish.
He missed such a good disciple.
I feel bad for you.
After listening to your words,
I feel so happy.
Thank you.
I don't think that you're happy with what you have.
After Chuen Chun Sect and Shaolin Temple,
will your next target be my Horizon of Heaven?
Martial Aunt, are you kidding?
Ordinary people like us know nothing but to fight each other.
We are not up to your level, a fairy that walks the earth.
Fame in the martial world is nothing to you.
Of course.
Other than the Pei Ming Stance and Yu Ling Lung,
nothing is important to me.
If I get these two things sooner and obtain longevity,
I would be able to kill Mo Han-wan.
Longevity?
Why haven't I heard of this before?
Who do you think you are? You don't know a lot about Tin San Sect.
Let's enjoy life while we can.
Forget all the troubles.
By the way,
don't you think that my place is like a paradise?
There's only one place that's better than Horizon of Heaven.
Where is it?
I dare not say it.
When did you go to the Hawk's Palace? Tell me!
Two weeks ago.
I was rejected by them. I didn't even step into the palace.
How thoughtful of you.
Aside from me, you also care about my senior.
You've misunderstood.
I just want to see the things left behind by Master.
But Mo Han-wan didn't allow me to enter.
Did she think she owns the Hawk's Palace?
This is ridiculous!
There's only one Heavenly Maiden.
It's stated in the rules of Tin San Sect.
The master of Hawk's Palace will be named Heavenly Maiden.
This is a fact no one can change.
Who does she think she is?
I'm better than her in kung fu and intelligence.
It's just because she went there earlier than me.
You've set up Horizon of Heaven in these eight years.
You've made it famous. Even more famous than Hawk's palace.
But I am afraid that she'll come and look for trouble.
One of you must die then.
Why don't you act first? You'll have a bigger chance to win.
Mo Han-wan.
Maiden, the Masters of the 72 Caves have been waiting long.
Okay.
-Respects to the Maiden. -Respects to the Maiden.
-We wish you a long life. -We wish you a long life.
I'm glad that you followed the rules this year.
I'll give you the antidote today.
Thank the Maiden.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
If you follow me, you will be more powerful.
If you betray me, it will make you breathless at once.
And you will suffer terribly.
Your life and death are under my control.
The Master of Ling Siu Cave is here.
Maiden, please forgive me.
Please give me back the lower part of my body.
-I've burnt it. -She has burnt it!
Well, then please let me die.
-Take him away. -Yes.
Break the rules of the Palace and you'll never reincarnate.
You may follow him if you wish to become like that.
-We dare not. -We dare not.
Here comes the Maiden.
Mo Han-wan, how are you?
How dare you call yourself the Maiden?
I am the master of Hawk's Palace.
That makes me the only Maiden.
I am the supreme.
You practiced the Solar Maiden Stance without permission,
caused our senior to leave,
then took over Hawk's Palace and named yourself the Maiden.
You planned the whole agenda.
Aren't you ashamed?
Nonsense. Look around.
The 72 masters of Tin San Caves are all under me.
How could Tin San Sect be that great if it weren't for me?
Will they listen to a witch like you if they weren't poisoned?
How dare you!
Shut up.
Cut the crap, what do you want?
There can only be one Maiden!
Where do you want to fight?
We're at Tin San, let's fight in the sky!
Mo Han-wan, follow me!
I am the fairy, you dare fight with me in the sky?
Get lost!
Li Chou-shui, stop running if you want to fight.
It's you who should be the one running away.
Solar is the sky, and Lunar is the earth.
Can you defeat my Solar Maiden Stance in the sky?
We'll find out soon.
The moon is hanging, I am the greatest in the world.
No one can defeat me!
What is she doing?
She must be taking drugs.
Why is she taking drugs at such a young age?
Ms. Tze.
The smoke is poisonous, stop taking it.
What do you know?
I will master the Melting Stance soon.
Then I will be the most invincible person in the world.
Why do you want to practice such a brutal stance?
I have to protect myself in this dangerous world.
I understand.
But the smoke may harm your health.
Do you really care about me?
No one in this world cares for me like you did.
I don't need that.
Stupid monk, I don't want your concern!
You're asking me to give up the Melting Stance.
Listen.
After I mastered the Melting Stance,
you must teach me Yi-kan Sutra.
And I will make you beg to be killed.
Stupid woman!
Who is calling me?
Where are you running?
Was that Master Ting?
If that was him, we would've been killed.
The Maiden is over there.
Who is it?
-Protect the Maiden. -Protect the Maiden.
Something's going on. Let's check it out.
Okay.
This is where you will die.
Do you really think that you're a fairy?
I'll fight with you in the sky.
Let's see how powerful you are.
Li Chou-shui and Mo Han-wan?
Why do they look so young?
Can the kung fu of Tin San Sect make someone stay young?
Who have I offended to deserve this?
What's that? It's so ugly!
Sorry, I wasn't talking about you. Don't bite me.
Yi-kan Sutra?
I'm sorry, Buddha. I didn't mean to practice it.
But I can't take it anymore!
It's useless to save your energy!
Still running?
It's a full moon tonight, my power is unlimited.
I was just warming up.
You'll die here.
A lunar eclipse?
The observatory machine is indeed useful.
Why? Do you want to come down? Go back up!
Didn't you say that you are the greatest?
Fight back!
Where is your unlimited power?
Call me Maiden and I will let you go.
Fight back, come on.
Kneel down and call me Maiden, Only then, I will let you go.
You wish.
There is only one Maiden!
Go to hell!
Get lost!
Trying to rise again?
-Maiden. -Maiden.
The Heavenly Maiden?
How are you, Martial Aunt?
Who are you?
I am the disciple of Sing Suk Sect.
You may call me Tze.
Did you see everything?
Don't you think that she deserves to die?
I didn't see anything.
Was I cruel?
No, I didn't see anything.
See you.
San and Sze, where are you?
Come out now!
Tai Hung.
-Stupid woman. -Stupid woman.
-Where can you go now? -Where can you go now?
You will die today.
-You will die today. -Hi, Master.
-After her! -Yes.
I feel so hot.
How are you?
I feel so hot.
It's killing me.
How troublesome.
I feel so hot!
Forget about him.
It's killing me.
I feel so hot.
I haven't done any good deeds before. I'm doing it just because of you.
I'll bring you along.
Where are you going, my dear sister?
Karma always strikes back.
Tai Hung, I am glad you come in time.
I have searched for you for days, going through mountains.
Finally, I've found this little monk.
He stole the Magic Wooden Tripod.
Don't you believe me? Just smell it.
You can smell the scent of Magic Wooden Tripod anywhere.
Isn't it with you?
I would have returned it to you if I have it.
You may search me.
Stupid woman!
Don't worry, not only will I search you,
I will even search inch by inch and get the Tripod.
What a big ice!
It must be Buddha.
Thank you, Buddha.
-Maiden, -Maiden,
-we wish you a long life. -we wish you a long life.
The master of Hawk's Palace?
Are you calling me that?
Han-wan, don't be afraid, I am here.
Chong-hoi.
Take a good rest, you will be all right.
Don't go.
Don't worry.
I will be with you until you get well.
I need not worry then.
Rest well.
What a pretty lady.
I must be dreaming. It must be a good dream given by Buddha.
Go back to sleep, don't wake up.
Who are you?
Get lost!
How dare you touch me?
No, please!
It's not a dream?
Who is that woman?
Oh no, where is my Buddha?
Luckily, I haven't lost it.
Should I go to Piu Miu Peak?
It's hard to decide.
My birthmark is gone.
How ugly.
The same food again?
Is there anything else other than vegetables?
Maiden, we've only got such things in this place.
Do you call this wine? There's no flavor!
Take these away and get lost!
-Maiden, -Maiden,
-we wish you a long life. -we wish you a long life.
What are you talking about?
I am not Mo Han-wan, stop it. Get lost!
-Get lost now! -Yes.
-Yes. -All right.
You, out of here!
All of you, get lost!
Why are the three of you so happy?
Yiu-Tze!
Our good relationship is already in the past.
Who will share my happiness now?
Congratulations, Martial Aunt.
Congratulations to you.
What do you mean?
You killed Mo Han-wan, the evil traitor of our sect.
That's wonderful news.
You come to the Hawk's Palace so quickly.
Are you trying to find out if I'm badly hurt or dying?
You always treat me as your nephew.
So, I've brought ginseng for you.
Tze.
How kind of you.
Do you think that I'll become weak because I'm old?
Martial Aunt, please stop making fun of me.
Martial Aunt.
This present is chosen specially for you by Master.
Other than ginseng, there are 12 fish from the South Water.
Taking and applying it will make you prettier.
Well, you don't need this at all.
You are so pretty, you may only need this 100 years later.
Kid, you're a sweet talker.
I am Tze, Martial Aunt.
We met the other day.
After seeing you, I admire you so much.
If I could be like you, even a little, I would be so happy.
All right, I'll let you be the Maiden when I retire.
I dare not accept the offer.
-Take it. -Yes.
Martial Aunt, you are so nice.
The air is fresh here because of its location.
You must feel cozy here.
It's a suffering.
Why? There are people staying with you here.
They are all rubbish.
They are no fun.
Hawk's Palace is the headquarters of our sect.
Don't compare it with the lower-class places.
The scenery here is so pretty.
Only you, a fairy who walks the earth, are a match to this place.
If I stay here any longer, I will become crazy.
I am still young.
I won't be as stupid as Mo Han-wan.
Ting Chun-chou, I've decided to move Hawk's Palace to Horizon of Heaven.
Good idea!
Since the two palaces are combined,
and your sect is one of my branches, come under me.
My sect has been established for a while, but I didn't manage it well.
It's not so well-organized yet.
I think that when I manage to organize it, then--
I've decided.
Come to Horizon of Heaven in a few days.
I am tired.
Have your dinner here, but there are not many dishes.
Ridiculous!
She is making me mad!
Ridiculous!
You old woman,
do you think you can rule over me just because I call your Martial Aunt?
She's gone too far!
I am so angry!
Master.
We can't go against her now, just bear with her.
Master.
Since she and Siu Yiu-tze have the same master,
maybe the way to counter her Killer Claw can be found in Master Siu's belongings.
Piu Miu Peak?
I don't know what kind of game So Sing-hoi has set up.
I would rather stay away from him if I could.
Master, don't make any more trouble now.
Please think wisely.
In fact, we can just say that we go there to worship Master Siu.
But we may alert them if there are too many of us.
I volunteer to go first and get everything prepared.
Save it.
You failed to obtain the Yi-kan Sutra last time.
It's better if Master does it himself.
Okay.
I've decided to go to Piu Miu Peak.
-Tze. -Yes.
Bring the disciples to wait right there, don't let anyone go up the mountain.
Ching, you will come with me.
Yes, Master.
Yes, Master.
Master is wise, you will be successful.
No one is around.
NONE PREVAILS WIT MASTER CHESS OF TRICKERY MAKES HISTORY
Is anybody here?
Is anybody here?
I am asked by the Master of Shaolin to look for Master Siu Yiu-tze.
Whatever you want, play the game first.
The game?
Why should I play it? I don't know how to play.
What should I do first?
I think I can put it anywhere.
What is this place?
Why am I here?
The same place again?
Buddha. Respects to the Buddha.
Amitābha.
-Here comes Master Ting. -Here comes Master Ting.
Welcome, Master Ting.
-Welcome, Master Ting. -Welcome, Master Ting.
So Sing-ho,
you've been hiding in Piu Miu Peak for 30 years.
What are you trying to do with this board game?
But I don't care about that.
Master Ting.
Today, I come to worship the Master.
Ting Chun-chou, you have the audacity to see Master?
I will clear the debt with you.
After the monk wins the game,
I will fix you.
How could you let a Shaolin monk play it?
I'll play it!
Don't touch him!
-The right Heavenly Generals -The right Heavenly Generals
-govern and control the world. -govern and control the world.
I am Hui-chuk, I am glad to meet you.
How dare you come into the game and challenge us?
I am told to see Siu Yiu-tze and solve the disaster of the world.
The people will be responsible for this matter.
As a monk, you should stay away from such matters.
If I don't get involved, how can I say I understand it?
What a sharp tongue! It's a sin to kill, do you dare to do it?
If I kill one to save the world, I won't mind being put in hell.
-How dare you! You big mouth. -How dare you! You big mouth.
-If you can't be a good monk, -If you can't be a good monk,
-how can you help the world? -how can you help the world?
-It's a sin to sneak away from Shaolin -It's a sin to sneak away from Shaolin
-and to be a coward. -and to be a coward.
I was forced to do so, it's none of my business.
Shut up!
You are a monk, how can you eat meat and drink?
I didn't!
You are tempted by a woman, you have shamed Buddha!
How can you continue living?
I didn't do that.
Little monk, confess now!
Nonsense! I came to save lives, but you mean to kill.
And you call yourselves Gods?
You are too mean.
You're monsters.
Since you are like monsters, I will kill you too.
-Nonsense! -Nonsense!
I am not afraid of you, I didn't do anything wrong.
I see, there's no Buddha without evil. I finally got it.
I am not afraid of you. Not at all!
You are hopeless.
-Die! -Die!
You're Gods but evil, I am not scared.
-Master Ting. -Get lost!
You won the game.
Go in!
I must check out the secret inside.
Don't act recklessly at Piu Miu Peak!
The Dragon Chronicles control the world.
They judge the good and the bad.
This is a rotating world.
Everything is controlled by the Dragon.
You have won the game.
Sir, who are you?
Weren't you looking for me?
You are the living dead, Siu Yiu-tze?
Right, I am the living dead.
In this world, Siu Yiu-tze no longer exist.
But I can't die, I have unfinished business.
I want you to succeed my inner power of Pei Ming Stance,
then help me kill the traitor, Ting Chun-chou.
What are you doing?
Don't move, I am passing all my power to you.
No, thanks.
You know Yi-kan Sutra? Great.
Take as much as you can then.
I don't want it.
You can't resist it now.
-But I don't need it. -Shut up.
Listen to me carefully.
Ting Chun-chou, what do you want?
You brought this bunch of rascals and act arrogantly here.
An ignorant man like you is short-sighted.
So Sing-hoi, let me show you the world!
Ching Fung!
Expel the evil spirit.
Sword? I'll use a sword too then.
Attack!
I'll move however I want.
The Melting Stance?
I won't let you enter.
You have no say now.
Even the Melting Stance can't melt you. You're really stubborn!
Siu Yiu-tze, so here's where you've been hiding.
You would rather pass your power to an outsider?
That's too much!
Do you think an air-wall can stop me?
Little monk, don't take it. The power belongs to me!
Little monk, remember what I told you.
Take this picture and jade to the Horizon of Heaven for this woman.
Go now!
Stay there!
No matter where you go, I'll get you!
Old man, you would rather die than giving me your power?
What did I do wrong?
I became your disciple so that I can be famous.
I'm well-known now but you won't even lay your eyes on me after death?
Fine, I will melt your body.
I will!
Pei Ming Stance Scroll?
Thank God!
You want me to stay on guard here alone in the cold weather.
Stupid old man.
I'll teach you a lesson when I get the chance.
What is that noise?
Get lost!
Who is it?
He looks familiar.
It's you, little monk.
It's none of your business, get lost!
-Go away. -Let's go.
You look much more handsome now.
Where have you been?
-Up there. -Why did you fall from up there?
Master Siu Yiu-tze of Piu Miu Peak transmitted his power to me.
Then, your master came and he threw me out.
Did Siu Yiu-tze pass you his energy?
Yes, he did, but I don't want it.
I told him that it's useless to me, but he insisted.
Since you don't want it, why not give it to me?
-Take it, it's useless to me anyway. -It's settled then. Don't lie.
-Promise me. -I won't lie. Take it.
That's great!
After learning the Pei Ming Stance, I'll be invincible.
Then, the old man will be scared of me.
How dare you!
-Tze, what did you say? -I will report to Master Ting.
Report me?
-But the dead can't talk! -Do you think you can do it?
Yes, so what?
It hurts!
You are hurt by my Painful Dart, so you will die of pain.
Are you okay?
-Get them! -Yes.
It hurts.
-Catch them! -Catch them!
It hurts.
No way.
You need to remove the poison from my body.
-Hurry up! -I can't.
I can't stand it, it hurts!
-It really hurts! -Okay, I'll try.
-Finally. -Are you all right?
No, stupid!
Oh, no.
If Ting Chun-chou comes, we will be dead meat.
But what place is safe?
Let's go to Li Chiu-shui's palace.
He is afraid of her.
Sure.
What's the relationship between you and Li? Tell me!
Who are you?
How dare you?
You had better kneel to the Heavenly Maiden.
Is she Mo who becomes a girl when wounded?
Yes. Nice to meet you, Maiden.
I am the disciple of Ting Chun-chou, Tze.
My life is threatened by my master, so I want to go to Li.
But after meeting you, I need not rely on her.
I want you to go there.
I want you to come with me and kill Li Chiu-shui.
What? You want me to kill her?
But I'm not skilled in fighting, it's like you're asking me to die.
Don't worry, I will teach you the Shifting Stance.
The Shifting Stance?
-You have to learn it too. -What?
-I am stupid, I can't do it. -Shut up.
Just do as I say!
What is the Shifting Stance?
Amazing.
Maiden, a girl named Tze wants to see you.
-Let her in. -Yes.
Stop dancing, get out.
Isn't she Li Chong-hoi, the woman in the picture?
How are you, Martial Aunt?
Why did you come here instead of following your master?
Martial Aunt,
I am worried about you, that's why I came a long way here.
What is the matter that even I have to be afraid?
Ting went to Piu Miu Peak and got Pei Ming Stance.
He wants to attack you.
I'm afraid you'll get hurt, that's why I came to warn you.
Aren't you afraid of being punished?
All I care about is informing you.
My life is not as important to me.
Well then, if anything happens, I will protect you.
Thank you.
This monk is my friend.
Ting wants to kill him too.
She is my junior, she got sick during the journey.
Greet the Maiden now.
I am Hui-chuk, respects to the Maiden.
Martial Aunt, please show mercy.
Where did you get this? Tell me!
A man called Siu Yiu-tze gave this to me before he died.
Yiu-tze.
Will you be upset?
How did he die?
If you don't tell me, I will kill you!
He...
He was killed by Ting Chun-chou.
Ting Chun-chou?
When he gave you this jade, did he tell you anything?
He asked me to look for you here.
He said he missed me, Li Chiu-shui, before he died?
Aren't you Li Chong-hoi?
I'm sorry.
I've promised him.
I won't reveal his will before I see Li Chong-hoi.
Fine.
Take him to the villa to wait for my sister.
Hurry up!
-Yes. -Yes.
Tze, go and rest with your junior.
Thank you, Martial Aunt.
Tze, I'll watch that monk with my Soul Stance.
Sit down and guard me.
I will teach you the use of Killing Charm in case of an emergency.
Yes.
Soul transmitting.
I see the monk.
Isn't this Chong-hoi's room?
Her cosmetics!
Where is Chong-hoi?
Chong-hoi.
Master, I am Li Chong-hoi.
Come here.
Let's sit there.
She is a fake.
My sister said that a friend of mine wants to tell me something.
I heard he asked you to come to me.
Master Siu Yiu-tze told me to give you this painting.
"I love her.
I will never fall for another person."
He only cared about Li Chong-hoi.
Miss, don't be too upset.
Before he died,
he said he was sorry, and he missed you so much.
Li Chong-hoi dragged him down!
Sorry, I couldn't control myself.
Don't blame yourself.
Master wanted me to tell you something.
Just go ahead.
Come and take a seat.
A monk won't tell gossip, Amitābha.
Miss, he asked me to remind you to be careful of your sister.
She's too evil and hard-hearted.
You must be wary of her and don't trust her.
Did he say so?
Yes.
I am touched.
How could he?
Miss,
I came here to learn Pei Ming Stance.
Pei Ming Stance?
Is there anything else that you haven't told me?
When I was in Piu Miu Peak,
he transmitted all his energy to me.
He wanted you to teach me how to kill Ting.
Did he transmit his energy to you?
Pei Ming Stance?
Yes, but I don't know how to use it.
Well, I do.
I can't imagine that I, Li Chiu-shui,
will be the one who's got the most powerful scroll of Tin San Sect.
Aren't you Li Chong-hoi?
Yiu-tze was too foolish to ask a stupid monk to be his disciple.
You don't deserve the kung fu, give it back!
Shift!
The Shifting Stance?
Can you escape from my Killing Claws?
Tze, I am going to give you some Killing Charms.
Go and stop Li Chiu-shui, don't let her touch the monk.
Shift.
Shift.
It's the same place. Shift.
Shift.
Shift.
It's useless, I had better use my feet.
Do you still want to go?
Return the power to me.
Killing Charm?
It's you!
Stupid woman.
I won't let you go!
-Follow me. Shift. -Shift.
What's this place?
I have to regain my power, I can't let her get Pei Ming Stance.
-Which direction did you shift to? -Down.
No wonder. You're more powerful than me.
I don't know anything.
This is like Siu Yiu-tze's place.
Impossible.
This must be the basement of Horizon of Heaven.
There is a person over there.
Who is she?
She is...
Chong-hoi!
-Li Chiu-shui? -Shift!
Wait!
She is dead.
She has been chasing us, why is she dead?
I am not dying before you!
How dare you enter the prohibited area?
Get lost!
Mo Han-wan?
Life is changing from time to time.
Love is disappearing in a flash.
Chong-hoi, I am here.
Where is your lyre? I haven't played with you yet.
It's her.
The one I hugged in the cave.
Don't touch her!
What a strong energy!
Chong-hoi, are you hurt?
Little monk, return the power to me!
Catch her.
What are you doing?
I'll take the power.
Me too.
I won't let you.
You can't say no.
Give it back.
Not that easy.
Martial Aunts, be merciful.
If this goes on, he will die.
Why is my power taken by him instead?
What's happening?
Yi-kan transmitting method?
If this goes on, we'll lose all our power.
-What should we do? -Hit me!
It's so funny. You wanted to get his power, but yours is taken instead.
You lost 70 percent while I only lost 50 percent of power.
You are more pitiful.
Not as much as you.
You pretended to be your own sister,
but no matter what, you can never compete with her.
It's because of people like you
that my sister died.
Siu Yiu-tze killed her, not me.
Where is the monk?
What are you doing here?
I feel so hot.
-I am cold. -How are you?
-I feel hot and cold. -Don't scare me.
I feel cold and hot at the same time. I am dying.
Just mix the energy with your Yi-kan Stance.
Try, come on. Mix it now.
Mixing.
You lost so much energy.
You will be as ugly as your Claw.
Remember to hide and don't scare others.
Shut up, you're turning into a witch too.
Tze, kill this woman.
And you'll be the new master of Hawk's Palace.
Yes. Wait... what?
Tze, go and check what is happening.
Sure. Shift.
Li Chiu-shui, you stupid woman.
Come out now!
Get a taste of the Pei Ming Stance.
Where are you?
Ting Chun-chou?
Traitor!
Shift.
Martial Aunts, Ting...
The ones I'm looking for are all here.
It looks like it'll be a tough job.
Stop dreaming. I am here, you can do nothing!
Traitor, who do you think you are?
Get lost now!
Shut up!
You monsters, open your eyes.
I am the only hero in this world.
If you don't leave, I will kill you!
Resist!
Kill!
-Tze, get the monk to practice. -Yes.
Get up now and practice.
Listen, send energy to your abdomen.
Yes.
Let the energy go freely.
Please, hurry up!
Ready, let the energy go freely.
Move it to the six valves.
No!
Concentrate your mind.
Then you can let the energy pass through the two important valves.
Move it right and down.
How could you fall down, stupid. Get up now.
Don't listen to her, let it go up.
Like this?
No, let it go down.
Down. Like this?
Stop playing already.
-Get the energy down now! -Come on!
How?
It's useless to practice now.
-Move the energy up. -Yes.
Just follow me!
It's heavy, I can't hold it.
Done!
Pei Ming Rope?
I was too careless.
Tell me, where is the Yu Ling Lung?
Tell me, then I'll let you live.
If you want it, find it in your next life.
You're still trying to be boastful.
Who do you think you are?
He improved so quickly.
If you don't tell me where it is, I will kill you!
-Die! -Melting Stance.
You, too?
Die!
Ching!
Maiden, did I do it right?
Well done.
Ching!
Ching!
Women can't be trusted, I'll kill you all!
Come on!
How dare you!
Break!
Hold it, I will go and help them.
Shift.
Release.
How dare you attack me?
Die!
What's the matter? Why is a dead person more powerful?
Chong-hoi!
Yiu-tze, I've got the Yu Ling Lung for you.
You can be reborn, but I can't stay with you.
Forgive me.
-Yu Ling Lung? -Chong-hoi, don't go!
How could you?
Yu Ling Lung!
Give it to me!
Do you want to get it? Never!
I would rather destroy it!
Hui-chuk be careful!
Why did it enter my body?
I am filled with power!
Do you still want to fool me?
-Killing Claw! -Melting Stance.
Get her!
You are either too old or too young.
But I am very powerful.
-Give me the Yu Ling Lung! -No!
Mo Han-wan, hold it.
Hold!
You are still holding up good.
Hui-chuk, toss it.
Toss!
Where is it?
What a joke.
I'll hold it back up.
Tze, go and help him.
Tze, try your best to hit him.
Kick!
Amazing!
Pei Ming Stance helps one to be reborn.
Thank you. If you didn't kill me, I wouldn't know it.
The Pei Ming Reborn Stance?
But I won't let you go.
I want to destroy your souls!
Tze, he has just been reborn, his soul is not well-formed.
Attack his soul.
His soul is in his shadow. Hit his shadow.
Yes, Martial Aunt.
Great, I've made it.
There is no more light.
Show his shadow!
The shadow is shown, hit it now.
Yes.
We'll die together!
Martial Aunt, I see it!
I killed him!
I am so great, right?
Life is always changing.
Fate can't be predicated.
Miss, please stay there.
Were you the woman in the ice?
You don't belong here, go now.
Life is always changing.
Fate can't be predicated.
-Greetings, Maiden. -Greetings, Maiden.
-We wish you a long life. -We wish you a long life.
From this day on, I am the new master of Hawk's Palace.
I forbid eating vegetables every day here.
I want songs and dance every day.
STRIDING SKY
Father, what's the name of this sword?
It's called The Ultimate Sword.
It is the best sword I've ever made in my life!
Which one is more important?
Martial arts or a good sword?
A good sword
can help a novice.
It can make an expert powerful.
However, the most important thing is the wielder of the sword.
Cloud, you must remember.
Kindness is invincible!
Lord Conqueror has led the Under Heaven Society
to its strong position today.
Mud Buddha, you're just praising yourself.
You're in charge of geomancy here.
And if we do well, so will you.
I hope so.
Jester, you are Lord Conqueror's right-hand man.
You are truly a servant of one and a master of thousands.
It's a dangerous way of living.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
His lordship has been waiting all day.
-Greetings, my lord! -Greetings, my lord!
CONQUEROR
You are here.
We've known each other for years.
You know me so well.
How will I do
in my duel with Sword Saint?
My lord's martial arts skills are no match in the world.
Nameless in the south and Sword Saint in the north
are not your worthy opponents.
Mud Buddha, when did you start talking like Jester?
My lord, I didn't teach him to talk like that.
If I can defeat Sword Saint,
the Under Heaven Society will soon rule the world.
But I can tell you this, my lord.
You might have to wait for another ten years
for the duel with Sword Saint.
Why do you say so?
The time has not come yet.
My lord, this is a gift for you.
What is it?
"When Wind and Cloud combine,
the Fish with Golden Scales becomes a Dragon."
These two birth charts
are of the two disciples you will have.
One of them has the name Wind.
The other is Cloud.
Wind and Cloud?
The wind is formless
and it never stays in place.
The cloud is scattered all around
and unpredictable.
As to how to find them
to build the empire for you,
that depends on your fate.
What about after I find them?
You will be invincible
for the first half of your life.
How about the last half?
You'll have to find Wind and Cloud first.
Jester.
Yes, my lord. What would you like me to do?
Use all necessary means.
You must find Wind and Cloud.
Yes, my lord.
This box
is made by Persian artisans.
It is called the Ying Yang Magic Box.
It has 108 Celestial Stems and Terrestrial Branches.
My lord is an intelligent man.
If you can find the correct combination
of the 108 Celestial Stems and Terrestrial Branches,
the box will open.
It holds the answer
to the second half of your life.
Only then will I be able to give you an explanation.
Do not use force to open this box.
If you do,
the Persian firearms inside it
will explode and all will be destroyed.
All right.
I, Conqueror, can certainly open this box.
YUK LUI SIN CITY
-Don't get in the way. Move! -Move!
By order of the Under Heaven Society, all boys with the listed birth chart
must become the disciples of the society.
Hurry up!
-Master! -Exert more force!
Master.
The Under Heaven Society is asking for Young Master's birth chart.
Don't ever let them know
Cloud's birth chart.
Got it.
Cloud.
Come here.
Hurry!
-Come on. Hurry! -Let's go!
Hurry!
Come on.
Hurry. Like this.
How was your practice?
Don't worry, Father. I didn't play around.
"When the river reaches Buddha's knee, it will burn down Ling Wan Cave."
Father, what does this mean?
This river floods all the time.
Legend says that
when Buddha's knees are covered with water,
Ling Wan Cave up in the mountains will catch fire.
So the villages will be flooded too?
Wind, I have carried you for so long.
Why don't you get down and walk?
Father, I like the feeling of being carried by you.
Father, will we get to see Mother?
Who told you that?
I'm already ten years old. I'm no longer a kid.
Promise me
to never mention your mother again.
All women
are trouble.
Conqueror, I have retired for many years.
Why are you forcing me?
Fire Unicorn Sword in the south and Ice Blizzard in the north.
My goal in life is to gather the world's ten greatest weapons.
It is a crime punishable by death that you possess the Blizzard Blade.
I have already buried it in the hills.
If you want to fight,
we'll use bamboo.
But if I win,
I'll choose between the Blizzard Blade or your wife.
If I lose today's duel,
you can have the Fire Unicorn Sword.
You must pay the price for your madness!
Whispering Prince, you used bamboo as a weapon.
This is only the first round.
I'll give you two years.
Bring the Blizzard Blade to me at Ling Wan Cave.
For now,
I will take your wife.
Wait here for me.
Father, I hope you'll bring Mother back.
It's been quite a while.
Are you alone?
Ngan Ying.
Darling.
How have you been for the past two years?
Very happy.
Whispering Prince,
you still don't get it?
Ngan Ying was the one who wanted to come with me.
I never forced her.
Ngan Ying!
Haven't you realized?
Ever since your retirement to the countryside,
I have never smiled.
What I want
is a real man who is celebrated as a hero.
I want your humble visitors
to adore me.
Now, I understand.
Only by robbing you of your love
can I arouse your fighting spirit
and force you to use the Blizzard Blade.
I will tell you a secret.
For the past two years,
I've only used her to vent my desires. I never loved her.
Conqueror, you are so despicable!
Mother!
-Mother. -Wind!
I missed you.
We will fight to the death,
but I have one request.
A request?
Tell me.
I have only one son, Wind.
If I die,
please let him live.
All right, I promise you.
WHEN THE RIVER REACHES BUDDHA'S KNEE,
IT WILL BURN DOWN LING WAN CAVE
I have done you and your father wrong.
Sorry!
Mother, don't die!
Mother!
Mother!
Father! Help!
Father!
-Wind, run! Go away! -No, I won't go!
Run!
-Hurry! Run! -Father!
Father!
What did Bou Village do to you?
Why do you have to wipe us out?
It is our lord's order.
Hand over your son and the Ultimate Sword.
Give it to the Under Heaven Society and we will spare you.
I'd rather die than surrender!
We'll find the sword after we kill all of you.
I have destroyed it. Even if you find it,
you cannot use it without my blood or my son's.
There's a child here.
Is he Striding Sky's son?
Perhaps not. He didn't shed a tear.
-Take the child and all the swords. -Yes.
Where is Father?
Calm down!
Be good.
My father brought you here.
If not, you would've been eaten by the wolves.
There's no need to look around. This is the Under Heaven Society.
I'm Charity, daughter of Lord Conqueror. He's Frost.
You were unconscious for two days.
Have some tea. I'll take you to eat later.
It's so hot. Can you drink it?
-My lord's brilliance -My lord's brilliance
-unites Heaven and Earth. -unites Heaven and Earth.
-My lord's brilliance -My lord's brilliance
-unites Heaven and Earth. -unites Heaven and Earth.
These three years, our society has been thriving.
We are the greatest clan now.
I am naming heirs to further strengthen the clan.
I hereby announce
that Frost, Striding Cloud,
and Whispering Wind will be my closest disciples.
With their Frost Fist,
Cloud Palm and Wind Kick,
the Under Heaven Society shall dominate the martial world.
-My lord's brilliance -My lord's brilliance
-unites Heaven and Earth. -unites Heaven and Earth.
"Unable to meet you for the duel as promised.
The duel will be postponed for ten years. From Sword Saint."
Mud Buddha, your predictions came true.
STRIDING CLOUD
Why didn't you attack with your full force?
Master Cloud's body is precious. I didn't dare to do so.
If I cannot handle your attacks,
then I deserve to die.
HAWK
Master Cloud.
His lordship wishes to see you
and Master Wind.
Bring the colored stones to Charity.
Yes.
Come on in.
Charity, this is forbidden ground.
We can't go in.
That applies to others.
But I'm Lord Conqueror's daughter.
This is the Sword Grave, our sword storage.
Even if it's not forbidden, it may still be dangerous.
That's why I asked you to come.
If you don't dare to come, I'll go in by myself.
You two go, I'll stand guard.
You're the nicest to me!
Let's go, Wind.
Women are trouble.
There are so many Magic Fire.
No, these are just firebugs.
I'll take some home.
Hey, someone's here! Let's go!
Okay.
Let's go.
UNDER HEAVEN SOCIETY
WITH THE UNIQUE POWERS OF WIND AND CLOUD,
LORD CONQUEROR HAS OBTAINED SUPREMACY AND EXPANDED HIS EMPIRE.
WITH THE STRENGTH OF HIS MARTIAL ARTS,
CONQUEROR HAS OVERCOME ALL BUT ONE OF HIS RIVALS, SWORD SAINT.
This prophecy is a gift from Mud Buddha.
Together with another verse,
I'll be able to find out about my fate.
That other verse
is still locked in this magic box.
I haven't been able to find the right combination for ten years,
and Mud Buddha has been missing for ten years.
Frost and Wind,
I have lost my patience.
Help me
and locate Mud Buddha quickly.
Legend says that
in order to find Mud Buddha, one must first seek the Fire Monkey.
Use this clue in your search.
Aren't you coming with us?
I am only a watchdog.
Once I step outside these gates, I'll be doomed.
I'm very delicate.
I can't take hardships.
-Jester! -Yes.
Wind, your Wind Kick lacks practical experience.
Therefore, on this journey,
-be careful and obey Frost. -I understand.
Cloud.
You have a different mission.
I'm waiting for your orders.
Dukgu Yat-fong in Matchless City wishes to become our ally.
I told him that
I wanted his Matchless Sword as a token of sincerity.
So I want you to take a trip to Matchless City.
I will bring back the Matchless Sword.
All right.
I want you to bring back
not only the sword, but also Dukgu Yat-fong's head.
Can you do it?
Yes.
All right.
You have achieved 70 percent of my skills with your Cloud Palm.
You can succeed
with Hawk's and Bat's help.
Father, I want to go too.
Charity, you want to go too?
If they can go, why can't I?
All right.
Would you like to go with Wind or Cloud?
You're going to kill people. I'm not coming with you.
Wind, I'll come with you.
We're not going to play.
Neither am I.
We'll defend the weak when we see injustice.
These are not the teachings of the Under Heaven Society.
Jester, cut the crap.
Prepare to leave tomorrow.
-Yes. -Yes, Master.
Charity, you stay.
All right.
Cloud.
Have you been to the forbidden Sword Grave with Charity?
Yes, but please don't tell Master.
Little Pigtails, wait!
Grandfather, come after me!
Little Pigtails, don't run!
Stop him! Don't let him go!
Sir, you shouldn't be here. Leave quickly.
Surround him!
-Surround him! -Hurry!
Sik Mou-zeon,
I respect you as a Shaolin monk.
Give me the Fire Monkey!
Great.
No one can turn down
DUKGU MING
an order from Matchless City.
"To find Mud Buddha, first seek the Fire Monkey."
Why do you want to find Mud Buddha?
It is my father's 60th birthday.
I want Mud Buddha to wish him well
and tell him that he will live a long life.
Life is determined by fate.
If Mud Buddha were to tell him
that he will die on his birthday,
what will happen then?
Nonsense!
Matchless City is at its strongest.
Together with the Under Heaven Society,
my father will be one of the top two rulers.
Soon, even Shaolin monks will have to suck up to us.
Fire Monkey belongs to the Shaolin Temple.
Mud Buddha stole it, so he must return it.
If you refuse to hand it over, you might not be able to return to Shaolin!
-I'm Whispering Wind. Sorry to interrupt. -Let's go.
They are about to fight. Let's go.
Sir, stay and watch what happens.
You don't know what is out there.
It might be even more dangerous out there.
How dare you act so arrogantly?
Great.
Wind Kick, Frost Fist.
Don't you recognize the masters of the Under Heaven Society?
And you said you had an alliance.
Sometimes, quantity doesn't mean anything.
We'll soon form an alliance.
That means we're on the same side.
Why do we fight among ourselves?
Don't simply say things.
Don't associate yourself with us.
Why are there so many of you fighting against a monk?
You can't possibly be good people.
So you're saying we're taking advantage?
Frost, did we hit them too hard?
I've only disabled their powers.
That's not too much at all.
Amitabha.
Your holiness,
this is my first quest.
I hope you can lend me the Fire Monkey.
I promise to return it in a month.
I told you it belongs to the Shaolin Temple.
If you must take it,
then what makes you different from those people?
Without the Fire Monkey, we can't find Mud Buddha.
How will I answer to my master?
Are you looking for Mud Buddha too?
You have no respect for me!
-That's right! Shut up! -That's right! Shut up!
Your holiness, please help us out with the Fire Monkey.
I'm sorry, but I cannot oblige.
Sir, forgive me.
Apologies.
Firey!
You can keep insulting me if you want.
Now that I have the Fire Monkey, I'm leaving.
Wind!
No need to go after them.
Why?
We only needed the Fire Monkey to find Mud Buddha.
Now that he is here,
why bother?
Sir, there's no need to hide your identity anymore.
You still see through me.
I know you're a famous master of disguise.
To keep calm in the face of such chaos,
you're no ordinary man.
Besides, the little girl is so innocent.
She cried out at the monkey when she saw it.
Of course it would blow your cover.
Grandfather, where are they taking Firey to?
Don't worry.
They won't hurt him.
I revealed too many secrets about the future.
I was punished by the Heaven
with boils all over my body.
Only the Fire Monkey can suck out the poison
and ease my pain.
Please bring it back to me.
Don't worry, sir. We'll try our best.
That's good to know.
Let's go.
Lord Conqueror must have been anxious to see me.
After you.
MATCHLESS CITY
Master Dukgu Yat-fong, you are a great man.
With 3,000 guests and a lively household with children and grandchildren,
you have all the good things that one could only desire.
For this year's birthday,
your only son, Dukgu Ming, is holding a three-day banquet for you.
How can he not be here?
He's out looking for Mud Buddha as a birthday gift for me.
-Has the Under Heaven Society sent anyone? -Not yet, Master.
Master Cloud, it's taken care of.
Master Dukgu Yat-fong looked very happy.
Everyone from Matchless City is there
except his only son, Dukgu Ming.
We'll strike at four in the morning.
-Yes! -Yes!
Who is it?
Forgive me for intruding.
I see.
It's Master Striding Cloud.
My master ordered me to bring back the Matchless Sword.
I didn't expect the Under Heaven Society to be so despicable.
Master, there's a survivor.
Please don't kill me!
Finish the job.
-What happened? -What is this?
What happened?
-Why? -Why is everyone dead?
-Why would it be like this? -Why?
Why?
So what if we found you?
So what if we found Mud Buddha?
The Fire Monkey is innocent. Don't blame it.
Your holiness.
I beg Shaolin to seek justice.
Help me seek revenge and justice.
To be able to kill all the people of Matchless City in one night...
Only the Under Heaven Society is powerful enough to do this.
Amitabha.
Wind, what are you thinking about?
My father died here.
Master rescued me.
Legend says that
Blood Bodhi fruits grow in Ling Wan Cave.
They heal all diseases and increase powers.
But no one has successfully gone in
and come out alive.
They say a Fire Beast guards the fruit.
Master Wind.
Do you know anything about your father's duel?
You've heard about this too?
Master said it was with the swordsman, Southern Unicorn.
He also died in the cave.
Can you promise me one thing?
Sir, just say it.
Little Pigtails has lost her parents.
I'm her only family.
I want to help her find a foster home.
Do you sense something wrong with the convention at the Under Heaven Society?
When the time comes,
even Mud Buddha can't guarantee his own safety.
Uncle, Father has been murdered.
He died a gruesome death.
We are all that's left of Matchless City.
Uncle, please seek justice for me!
Help us avenge Matchless City and my father.
Uncle, you must help me seek revenge.
Help me seek revenge.
SWORD SAINT
-Awesome. -Amazing.
-Awesome. -Amazing.
Awesome.
Sir, that couple agreed to adopt Little Pigtails.
Master Wind is a kind person.
If everyone in the Under Heaven Society were like you,
the martial world would be at peace.
How is Conqueror's other disciple, Striding Cloud?
Cloud is a loner and a moody person.
But his martial art is the best among all of us.
Exactly as it is destined to be.
Grandfather!
-Grandfather! -Come back here!
Don't go over there!
Come back, Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
DESTINY
THE DRAGON IS POWERFUL,
BUT IT WILL BE STRANDED WHEN WIND AND CLOUD BECOME A STORM
"The Dragon is powerful,
but it will be stranded when Wind and Cloud become a storm."
Years ago, you left without a word,
leaving me with this piece of junk.
Now, the puzzle has been revealed.
Explain to me what it means!
"Wind and Cloud will make you
and break you as well."
What does that mean?
One cannot fight against his destiny.
My lord's ten years of good fortune have passed.
It is now the turning point of your life.
"Wind and Cloud will make you and break you as well."
Obviously, it means that my life is now under the control of wind and cloud.
But does that "wind" and "cloud"
refer to my disciples,
Whispering Wind and Striding Cloud?
It is inevitable that the servants will usurp the master.
This is destiny. Even mortals cannot fight it.
Destiny?
I don't believe in destiny or fate.
My lord was a great believer
until now.
That's how mortals are.
They believe in good fortunes, but deny the bad ones.
They are deceiving themselves!
We are the masters of our own destiny!
I hold my destiny in my own hands.
I will defy God's plan and change my fate!
CLOUD
WIND
WIND
CLOUD
WIND, CLOUD
Four famous weapons of the martial world.
One blade and three swords. All priceless treasures.
The Blizzard Blade and Whispering Prince are still buried in Ling Wan Cave.
The Ultimate Sword is nowhere to be found.
The Fire Unicorn Sword and the Matchless Sword
are both mine.
How delightful.
Cloud.
You didn't disappoint me.
You taught me well.
Good!
Father!
Behave like a lady.
I heard Cloud returned.
I just wanted to see him.
Thank you for your concern.
Who's concerned about you?
I'm concerned about what you owe me.
Did you bring them?
Charity, what does Cloud owe you?
Father, your passion is to collect famous swords.
Just like you, I'm fond of collecting interesting stones.
Cloud owes me 19 colorful stones.
Ridiculous!
My lord!
Master Frost and Master Wind have returned.
Where are they?
They are outside. They don't dare to come in.
Get up!
You only lost Mud Buddha due to your inexperience.
-Thank you, Master. -Thank you, Master.
Good thing Cloud accomplished his mission
and brought back the Matchless Sword.
I'm going back to my chamber.
Striding Cloud's mood is unpredictable like a wild horse.
It's been ten years.
When word of Dukgu Yat-fong's death gets out,
I believe Sword Saint will come to me soon.
We'll finish our duel from ten years ago.
I must go into seclusion and intensively train my Trinity Strength.
Come here.
Before I go into seclusion,
I must settle something.
Among my three disciples, you have the kindest heart.
Wind, it is my wish for you marry my daughter.
I will arrange for a date.
Charity, don't you like Wind?
I don't know.
Look after her.
Master, let's discuss the wedding later.
Your father and I had betrothed you to each other.
I didn't tell you earlier
because it wasn't the right time.
You and Charity grew up together.
You're a perfect match.
If you don't agree,
how will I go into seclusion and practice my skills in peace?
Congratulations, Wind.
Skinny and Girlie.
Let me tell you something.
Well, I do like Wind.
But I also like Cloud.
Charity, it's me, Wind.
Wind.
I want to tell you something.
Come in.
This is not Sword Grave. You won't be punished.
-I'll leave after I'm done. -Go ahead.
I remember when Master brought me here,
you were the first to offer me some tea.
It felt very warm.
Father said if he hadn't rescued you,
you would have been eaten by the wolves.
I remember.
So when he mentioned about the wedding today,
I was very happy.
But I know love must come from both sides.
I don't know if this is Master's one-sided wish
or if it is your own wish.
If this is not what you want, I won't force you.
Does Charity know about this?
I'm the one to decide. She has no say in it.
Your eyes look the same as the time I took you in ten years ago.
If you're unhappy about this,
you may be excused from attending the wedding banquet.
Mr. Yu.
You're the most respected person in our village.
You must help us.
When we are sick, we come to you to seek treatment.
You help us out in times of trouble.
We respect you the most.
We have had bad harvests
and the Under Heaven Society taxes are high.
We can barely survive.
Please help us.
All right. I will represent our region and meet with Conqueror
to explain your plight.
Thank you, Mr. Yu.
-Thank you. -Please get up.
Go home.
Muse and I will depart in a few days.
Let's go home.
Muse.
Father, look at your arm. It's all red.
It does not seem to belong to me.
Sometimes, it hurts so much.
They say I can heal all diseases.
But I cannot even heal myself.
Father, are we really going to the Under Heaven Society?
Wonderful! I can go and see the world.
I can learn to mingle and explore.
What are you talking about?
I'm just saying nonsense.
UNDER HEAVEN SOCIETY
Welcome!
Master Frost!
Here, try it on.
Jester, what are you doing?
The groom will have to tie this on.
Do me a favor. See how it looks.
You look pale and sick.
Not as pale as you!
Charity is getting married. Are you feeling sad?
No. Who said so?
I watched all of you grow up. I know everything.
If you love someone, you only wish for her to be happy.
Wind has a kind heart.
It is good that Charity is marrying him.
Congratulations!
Lord Conqueror's daughter is getting married.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
It's the groom! Congratulations!
I heard that your wife
-is very beautiful. -I'm not the groom.
I'm Frost...
I'm Frost of the Under Heaven Society.
I welcome you on behalf of my master.
So you're the famous Frost.
Lord Conqueror has three disciples.
Fist, Palm, and Kick.
Each one has its own specialty. Too bad they don't use swords.
You are so crazy about swords.
-Could you be Seedy Sword-- -That's right!
Father, look over there.
Hey, the invitation card.
I'm Yu Ngok from the Lake region,
representing 320 villages in 16 towns.
-I seek a meeting with Lord Conqueror. -Where's your invitation card?
Is there a celebration?
Great! I have never been to a banquet!
Sir, is it a birthday, a wedding, or a newborn party?
Muse.
There are so many people anyway.
Having us there won't make a difference.
Please let us in to have a look.
What is it?
-Mr. Jester. -I'm Yu Ngok.
Mr. White Face, can you let us in?
What's that smell? It stinks!
It's the scent of a woman.
The scent of a woman?
We pick herbs in the mountains.
It's the smell of herbs.
-Pick herbs? -Yes.
You're the Heal-all Yu Ngok with the Fire Beast Arm?
That's right.
I thank you on behalf of Lord Conqueror.
-Come in. We'll talk after the banquet. -All right.
Let's go.
Be careful.
Leave us.
-Yes, my lord. -Yes, my lord.
Father.
It's your wedding day today.
It makes me miss your mother.
You look a lot like her.
Do I really look like Mother?
She died giving birth to you.
All these years,
though I've had other women,
the one that I loved the most...
was your mother.
I always thought you had a heart of stone.
Charity.
Do you know what I wish for the most?
Not for the best martial arts.
Not to be the ruler of the world.
But to see
my daughter live a happy life.
I hope you'll have a happy marriage.
Father.
Conqueror! Come out, you old bastard!
I seek revenge on behalf of Matchless City!
Dukgu Ming, do you think you can kick up a fuss here?
You overestimated yourself.
The Under Heaven Society killed my family, my father, and stole the Matchless Sword.
Even if I fail to seek revenge,
I must have Conqueror explain his evil deeds.
Return Matchless City! Return the Matchless Sword!
Sik Mou-zeon, what does it have to do with you?
Monks should be charitable and kind.
So I promised him
to help investigate the murder of his family.
I hope you will help in the name of Buddha.
Today is my daughter's wedding day.
I won't let any conflict interrupt tonight's celebration.
The Under Heaven Society might not be as influential as Shaolin.
But I believe no one will deny
that we're the leaders of other clans.
Excuse me for being straightforward.
Support me and you shall prosper.
Those who oppose me shall die!
Amitabha.
You have explained your position clearly,
and I have to keep the peace.
Dukgu Ming, what do you think?
My skills are not good enough.
I cannot even defeat Wind.
I am certainly no match for Conqueror.
I came to deliver this on behalf of my uncle, Sword Saint.
"Our battle should take place during the autumn solstice.
This will settle our ten-year-old appointment."
I've waited for this for so long.
Everything's fine now!
A toast, everyone! Music!
HAPPINESS
I wish I were the bride.
You're such a tomboy. Who will ever marry you?
Wind is the lord's favorite disciple, and he will be his son-in-law.
So after the ceremony, he will be twice as close!
Wind,
promise me that you will treat Charity well.
Understand?
I will obey your wishes.
Do the ritual. Come on.
Hold it!
Cloud.
Cloud.
Come with me.
Striding Cloud, how dare of you to act wantonly in my presence!
I thought you would never come!
Why did you agree to marry Whispering Wind?
You never ask why.
I cannot let another man touch you.
I can marry him and still keep seeing you.
Charity.
Get back here.
I have obeyed you the past ten years.
I'm leaving the Under Heaven Society and taking Charity with me.
If you're a man, go and fight for your wife.
Don't let the world laugh at you.
Fight for your reputation!
Cloud.
-Master! -Shut up!
Father!
Look out!
-Charity! -Charity!
Charity!
She is already my woman.
Go away!
Charity,
is it true?
I'm sorry, Wind.
Why did you agree to marry me then?
Have you ever loved me?
Yes.
It's all right if you don't love me.
Love doesn't call for an explanation.
You'll always be mine.
Charity,
I love you.
I'll always be with you.
Charity.
Master!
I killed my own daughter.
HAP MAUSOLEUM
Gratitude to the ancestors. Phoenix is finally pregnant.
The Lui family line will be continued,
and the Hap family will continue for generations and prosper!
Father, bless us.
I will take good care of your descendants.
Lui Fook.
You guard this shrine well.
Even though he is preserved with the Ice Soul,
you must still protect my late father's body.
Yes.
Phoenix.
-Take a seat. -All right.
RIGHTEOUS, INHERITANCE, LOYALTY
Who is it?
I, Striding Cloud, wish to borrow your Ice Soul.
What?
It is our family heirloom.
Who are you to take it?
I will accept any condition
as long as you agree to lend it to me.
Striding Cloud, the Ice Soul is stored in my late father's body.
I am very moved that you would take such a risk
for your loved one.
But have you considered it on our behalf?
If you take it away, how will I answer to my ancestors?
That is your problem, not mine.
Sorry, I cannot oblige.
Chase him out.
Phoenix!
-Phoenix! -Dragon!
Are you all right?
I came for the Ice Soul.
I do not wish to hurt you.
HAP MANOR
HAP MAUSOLEUM
Stop right there!
This is the mausoleum. No one is allowed to enter.
Leave if you wish to live!
-Let's go. -Hurry.
Striding Cloud, return Charity's body to me.
No one can take her away.
You think you can stop me?
I did not teach you the last move of Cloud Palm.
I...
will show it to you today so that you can die in peace.
Cloud Palm will only work with liquid,
but we are in the desert now.
I followed you here before I confronted you.
Let's see how much blood you have.
I will use it to enrich my Trinity Strength.
Charity, wait for me!
Father, look! Someone has passed out here.
-It's Striding Cloud who stole the bride! -What?
Striding Cloud.
Give me back my daughter.
I must avenge Father.
You must really love that girl.
That's so nice.
You know how to love whether you're conscious or unconscious.
Charity.
Muse, what are you doing?
Nothing. His body is still very hot. I'll get some medicine.
I've asked around.
After Conqueror killed his own daughter,
Striding Cloud took the body
and got into a lot of trouble.
Conqueror did all this to him at the royal mausoleum.
Why would there be such hatred between them?
I think he's very pitiful.
He lost his lover and his arm in one day.
-Father, will he be crippled? -Listen.
You must be very careful when picking a husband.
Who says I want to get married?
It's written all over your face.
You taught me yourself.
As a physician, it is our mission to save and help those in need.
No matter good or bad,
a life is a life, right?
Father, what's wrong?
Father!
Father, are you all right?
Are you okay?
-I'll stop thinking about getting married. -This arm...
-Since I succeeded in training my arm, -Father, are you all right?
-it has been rejecting my body. -Don't scare me.
It's as though it doesn't belong to me.
I can't control it.
Muse, quickly inform Mr. Root and Mr. Chili
to help exchange the arm. Hurry!
Since Striding Cloud's arrival,
I've had a feeling that
this arm has found its real master.
I decided to give him my Fire Beast Arm.
Striding Cloud, you ran into my daughter and me.
Take it as us repaying a debt from a previous life.
Good medicine always tastes bitter.
You are...
I am Muse.
You've been unconscious for four days.
If my father and I had not rescued you, you would have died.
My arm...
What happened?
I put it on for you.
You're awake.
It was my arm. Take it as a present from me.
-We met before at the wedding-- -Muse.
The Fire Beast Arm has finally found its rightful owner.
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
Striding Cloud, your arm is still in recovery.
It needs plenty of rest.
Muse, let's go. Don't disturb him.
I'm feeding him his medicine.
He has his arm now.
Wind.
For the past two months, you've done nothing but drink and sleep.
If you go on like this, you will be wasted!
So be it.
Let me be.
I order you to get the Blood Bodhi fruit from Ling Wan Cave with Hawk and Bat.
That's where your father died.
You're on your own now.
Cloud.
Cloud.
Cloud.
Cloud.
Cloud.
It's time to eat.
Do you still miss her?
Let me tell you.
When I saw your lover at the Under Heaven Society
in that beautiful bridal gown,
I was so envious.
Do they call you Muse because you are very pitiful?
Certainly not!
Hunan is also called Muse.
I was born here. That's why I'm called Muse.
It's as simple as that.
Thank you both for rescuing me.
Don't mention it.
Will you be returning to the Under Heaven Society?
That's for sure.
I want to seek revenge.
An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.
In this world,
some people
have no friends and no love.
And that person is me.
Father, I like the feeling of being carried by you.
Mother!
Master Wind.
Have some water.
Here.
What is that on the cliff?
The Blood Bodhi fruit! That must be the Blood Bodhi fruit!
His lordship said that by taking just one, your powers will be boosted.
Run!
Hurry! Run!
Beast!
-Come out! -Stop shouting.
-Come out! -Stop! It might really come out.
Master Wind, please don't blame us.
That day, all 296 people at Matchless City
took this colorless, scentless, flesh-rotting, and bone-eating poison.
They died in the hands of Master Cloud.
Why are you doing this?
Lord Conqueror ordered it. So we have to oblige.
It doesn't make sense.
If we bring back your head and the fruits, we'll make great contributions.
I'll give you back the fruits.
Let's call it even.
With a heart as clear as ice, the sky may fall and I will not fear.
With a heart as clear as ice, the sky may fall and I will not fear.
With a heart as clear as ice, the sky may fall and I will not fear.
Who is it?
It's me, Jester.
Congratulations, my lord.
You have achieved amazing powers! World-dominating powers!
What are you talking about?
Sword Saint overestimated himself and dared to challenge my lord.
He doesn't know you have achieved this amazing power.
Really, you're fulfilling destiny.
Fulfilling destiny?
Yes, fulfilling destiny.
Jester.
You're a sweet-talker.
You're full of nonsense!
No, I don't dare to do that.
Every word I say comes from my heart.
Get out.
Yes.
Greetings, Master.
You are the only one I don't have to worry about.
Wind and Cloud are both gone.
I want to focus on the battle tomorrow.
I can't be distracted.
So I command you to lead all three halls
to help me rule the world.
I'm worried that I'm not capable of that.
I have full confidence in you.
Frost, it is my life's ambition to beat Sword Saint.
Soon, the leadership of the Under Heaven Society
will be yours.
Thank you, Master.
In the face of battle to preserve our interests,
the Under Heaven Society cannot afford any mistakes.
Whoever is disloyal to me must die.
Get rid of Jester.
Have you seen Jester?
No.
Stop!
Please don't kill me.
Lord Conqueror is a true villain.
-He's just using you. -Bullshit!
You betrayed Master. You must die!
He tricked Wind and Cloud.
I'll take you to someone. Then, you'll understand.
It is Mud Buddha. Lord Conqueror has imprisoned him.
Jester, you look so ridiculous
in this outfit.
Let me get changed first and I'll take you to Mud Buddha.
Master Frost.
So, the man who kidnapped him the other day was Master?
I must fight.
I must hang in there.
I must hang in there.
Your parents are dead
all because of Conqueror.
I purposely gave him
Cloud's birth chart and yours
so that he would let you live.
Is it destiny?
All I know is that everything goes in cycles.
That's karma.
Everything will have its final judgment.
What should I do?
"The Dragon is powerful,
but it will be stranded when Wind and Cloud become a storm."
The Sword Saint is here.
It's a long-awaited duel!
Although I rule the martial world now,
not being able to fight you and decide the winner
is like having a bone stuck in my throat.
I'm glad you have preserved your strength.
You are still strong.
If I can defeat you today,
I will have no regrets.
I accept your challenge with my Matchless Sword.
And I want the entire Dukgu family
to concede defeat.
Wait here.
Is he human? Why is he not moving?
Don't.
Stay here.
-I'm going in. -Okay.
Uncle!
-Conqueror, I'll die with you! -Young Master, don't go.
I am so useless.
Help me seek revenge.
Mud Buddha said, Wind and Cloud must be together. Or it won't form a storm.
Cloud!
Blood Bodhi fruit can boost your powers.
Frost, announce to the world,
I have defeated Sword Saint.
I am now truly invincible.
You killed Whispering Wind and Striding Cloud's parents.
You ordered Hawk and Bat
to kill Wind.
Am I right?
So you didn't kill Jester?
Conqueror, you're so ruthless!
I was right.
Among the three of you, you are the most naive.
You never intended to let me have your position.
You're only using me!
That's right.
I want the entire martial world to know.
It's better if they owe me, rather than I owe them.
You're no exception.
Frost, where are you going?
I'm leaving Under Heaven Society.
Do you think
you can just come and go as you please?
Frost.
Both of you are still alive?
Conqueror.
Sword Saint's martial art is truly powerful.
But nothing as compared to my Trinity Strength.
Ten years ago, I asked you.
Aren't you afraid that I'll avenge my father?
If I could take you in,
I've predicted that this day would come.
Master Wind.
Do not use all your force.
Do not say all you think of.
If you go too far, destiny will prematurely end.
WHEN WIND AND CLOUD COMBINE, THE FISH WITH GOLDEN SCALES BECOMES A DRAGON
I taught you all the martial arts.
Remember, I am your Master.
Cloud is unpredictable
and Wind is formless.
You think both of you can defeat me?
Let me tell you.
This is Sword Grave.
Besides swords,
it will also be your burial ground.
Prepare to die!
I taught you Fist, Palm and Kick.
But my best martial skill
is to fight with the sword!
"The Dragon is powerful,
but it will be stranded when Wind and Cloud become a storm."
Mud Buddha, I don't believe in your predictions.
I only believe in myself.
I have destroyed it.
Even if you find it,
you cannot use it without my blood or my son's.
Father.
Father.
Father.
Father, I'm suffering. Save me.
Charity.
-Charity. -Father, I'm sorry.
-Charity. -Father, I'm suffering.
Father, save me. I'm sorry.
-Conqueror! -Conqueror, you're so ruthless!
-Conqueror! -Conqueror!
Give me back the lives of my family!
Give me back my reputation!
-Give me back my reputation! -Conqueror!
Conqueror.
Cloud!
What are you doing?
Get out of my way.
He raised us after all.
Sword Saint.
Whispering Prince.
Where are you now?
I'm the best in the world!
"If you go too far,
destiny will end prematurely."
I'm the best in the world.
I'm the best in the world.
Do you want a chocolate?
I could eat about a million-and-a-half of these.
My mama always said, "Life was like a box of chocolates."
You never know what you're gonna get.
Those must be comfortable shoes.
I bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing.
I wish I had shoes like that.
My feet hurt.
[munches] Mama always said "There's an awful lot
you can tell about a person by their shoes."
Where they're going, where they've been.
I've worn lots of shoes.
I bet if I think about it real hard I could remember my first pair of shoes.
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.
She said they was my magic shoes.
All right, Forrest, you can open your eyes now.
Let's take a little walk around.
How do those feel?
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump, as strong as I've ever seen.
But his back's as crooked as a politician.
But we're going to straighten him right up now, aren't we, Forrest?
-[thuds] -Forrest!
[Forrest] Now, when I was a baby, Mama named me
[Forrest] Now, when I was a baby, Mama named me after the great Civil War hero General Nathan Bedford Forrest.
after the great Civil War hero General Nathan Bedford Forrest.
-[piano music playing] -[Forrest] She said we was related to him
in some way. And what he did was,
he started up this club called the Ku Klux Klan.
They'd all dress up in their robes and their bedsheets
and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or somethin'.
They'd even put bedsheets on their horses and ride around.
And, anyway, that's how I got my name, Forrest Gump.
Mama said that the Forrest part was to remind me
Mama said that the Forrest part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well, just don't make no sense.
that sometimes we all do things that, well, just don't make no sense. -[braces clattering] -[music playing over radio]
Just wait, let me get it. Give it to me.
Wait, is it this way? Hold on. [grunts]
[grunts] All right.
What are y'all starin' at?
Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before?
Don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, Forrest.
If God intended everybody to be the same, he'd have given us all braces on our legs.
[Forrest] Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.
We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17,
about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama.
That's in the county of Greenbow.
Our house had been in Mama's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa
had come across the ocean about a 1000 years ago
or somethin' like that.
Since it was just me and Mama and we had all these empty rooms,
Mama decided to let those rooms out, mostly to people passing through,
like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that.
And that's how me and Mama got money.
Mama was a real smart lady.
[Mrs. Gump] Remember what I told you, Forrest. You're no different than anybody else is.
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?
You're the same as everybody else. You are no different.
Your boy's… different, Mrs. Gump.
Now, his I.Q. is 75.
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.
[Forrest] She wanted me to have the finest education, so she took me
[Forrest] She wanted me to have the finest education, so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School.
I met the principal and all.
[Mr. Hancock] I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump.
Now, this is normal.
Forrest is right here.
The state requires a minimum I.Q. of 80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.
He's gonna have to go to a special school.
Now, he'll be just fine.
What does normal mean anyway? He might be…
What does normal mean anyway? He might be… a bit on the slow side…
but my boy Forrest is gonna get the same opportunities as everyone else.
He's not going to some special school to learn how to retread tires.
We're talking about five little points here.
There must be something that can be done.
[chuckles] We're a progressive school system.
We don't want to see anybody left behind.
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?
He's on vacation.
Well, your mama sure does care about your schooling, son.
You don't say much, do you?
"Finally, he had to try. It looked easy, but…"
-"Oh, what happened. First, they--" -Mama, what's vacation mean?
-Vacation? -Where Daddy went?
Vacation's when you go somewhere…
and you don't ever come back.
[Forrest] Anyway, I guess you could say me and Mama was on our own.
But we didn't mind. Our house was never empty. There was always folks coming and going.
Our house was never empty. There was always folks coming and going.
-Supper! It's supper, everyone! Forrest! -My, my, that sure looks special.
[Forrest] Sometimes we had so many people staying with us
that every room was filled with travelers, you know,
that every room was filled with travelers, you know, -folks living out of their suitcases… -[Mrs. Gump] Well, you go ahead and start.
-and hat cases, and sample cases. -I can't find Forrest. Forrest!
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest?
[Forrest] One time, a young man was staying with us,
and he had him a guitar case.
Forrest. I told you not to bother this nice, young man.
[Elvis] Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.
I… I was showing him a thing or two on the guitar here.
Well, all right then. Supper's ready if y'all want to eat.
[Elvis] Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, ma'am.
Say, man, show me that crazy little walk you just did there.
Slow it down, son.
♪ You ain't nothing but a… ♪ -[Forrest] I liked that guitar. -♪ And you know it ♪
[Forrest] It sounded good.
I started moving around to the music, swinging my hips.
I started moving around to the music, swinging my hips. [Elvis] ♪ Cryin' all the time ♪
[Forrest] This one night, me and Mama was out shoppin',
and we walked by Vincy's furniture and appliance store, and guess what?
-♪ You ain't nothin' but a hound dog ♪ -This is not for children's eyes.
[Forrest] Some years later, that handsome young man
who they called the King…
well, he sung too many songs.
Had himself a heart attack or something.
It must be hard bein' a king.
You know, it's funny how you remember some things, but some things you can't.
You do your very best now, Forrest. -I sure will, Mama. -[tires squeal]
[Forrest] I remember the bus ride on the first day of school very well.
Are you coming along?
Mama said not to be taking rides from strangers.
This is the bus to school.
I'm Forrest, Forrest Gump.
-I'm Dorothy Harris. -Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.
This seat's taken.
It's taken.
You can't sit here.
[Forrest] You know, it's funny what a young man recollects,
'cause I don't remember being born.
I… I don't recall what I got for my first Christmas,
and I don't know when I went on my first outdoor picnic but…
and I don't know when I went on my first outdoor picnic but… I do remember the first time I heard the sweetest voice in the wide world.
I do remember the first time I heard the sweetest voice in the wide world.
[young Jenny] You can sit here if you want.
-[orchestral music playing] -[Forrest] I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life.
She was like an angel.
Well, are you gonna sit down, or aren't you?
What's wrong with your legs?
Um, nothing at all, thank you. My legs are just fine and dandy.
[Forrest] I just sat next to her on that bus
and had a conversation all the way to school.
My mama says back's crooked like a question mark.
These are gonna make me…
[Forrest] And next to Mama, no one ever talked to me or asked me questions.
Are you stupid or something?
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."
I'm Jenny. I'm Forrest, Forrest Gump.
[Forrest] From that day on, we was always together.
Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.
[Forrest] She taught me how to climb.
Come on, Forrest, you can do it!
[Forrest] I showed her how to dangle.
"A good little…"
[Forrest] She helped me learn how to read… and I showed her how to swing.
Sometimes, we'd just sit out and wait for the stars.
[young Forrest] Mama's gonna worry about me. Just stay a little longer.
[Forrest] For some reason, Jenny didn't never want to go home.
Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.
[Forrest] She was my most special friend.
My only friend.
Now my mama always told me that miracles happen every day.
Some people don't think so, but they do.
Hey, dummy!
[boy 1] Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?
[boy 2] Look, I'm Forrest Gimp. [young Jenny] Just run away, Forrest.
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!
-Get the bikes! -[boy] Hurry up. Let's get him!
Come on! Look out, dummy. Here we come. We're going to get you!
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!
Come back here, you!
Run, Forrest! Run!
[Forrest] Now you wouldn't believe it if I told you…
but I could run like the wind blows.
From that day on, if I was going somewhere,
I was running.
That boy sure is a runnin' fool.
[Forrest] Now remember how I told you that Jenny never seemed to wanna go home?
Well, she lived in a house that was as old as Alabama.
Her mama had gone up to heaven when she was five,
and her daddy was some kind of a farmer.
[young Forrest] Jenny?
[Forrest] He was a very loving man.
[young Forrest] Jenny? [Forrest] He was always kissing and touchin' her and her sisters.
And then this one time, Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.
Jenny, why didn't you come to school today? Shh. Daddy's takin' a nap.
Shh. Daddy's takin' a nap. -[thuds] -[Jenny's father] Jenny!
-[thuds] -[Jenny's father] Jenny! -Come on! -[thudding, clattering]
[Jenny's father] Jenny, where'd you run to?
You better get back here, girl!
Where you at?
[Jenny's father] Jenny! Jenny, where you at?
Jenny!
[young Jenny] Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.
-[Jenny's father] Jenny! -[Jenny] Dear God, make me a bird
-[Jenny's father] Jenny! -[Jenny] Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far, far away from here.
so I can fly far, far, far away from here.
Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far,
-far, far from here. -[birds tweeting]
[Forrest] Mama always said that God is mysterious.
-[Jenny's father] Jenny! -[Forrest] He didn't turn Jenny
-[Jenny's father] Jenny! -[Forrest] He didn't turn Jenny -into a bird that day. -[Jenny's father] You get back here!
-into a bird that day. -[Jenny's father] You get back here!
[Forrest] Instead…
he had the police say Jenny didn't have to stay -in that house no more. -[dog snarls, barks]
[Forrest] She went to live with her grandma just over on Creekmore Avenue,
which made me happy 'cause she was so close.
-[thunderclaps] -[Forrest] Some nights, Jenny'd sneak out and come on over to my house just 'cause she said she was scared.
and come on over to my house just 'cause she said she was scared.
-Scared of what, I don't know. -[door creaking]
[Forrest] But I think it was her grandma's dog.
He was a mean dog.
Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends all the way up through high school.
-[boy] Hey, stupid! -Quit it!
-[boys laughing] -Run, Forrest, run! -Hey! Did you hear me, stupid? -[hooting]
-Hey! Did you hear me, stupid? -[hooting]
-[Jenny] Run, Forrest! -[boy] Come on, get in the truck!
Get in the truck! Let's move it!
Come on! He's getting away! Move it!
Run, Forrest! Run!
-Move it, dumbass! -Yeah, you better be running!
[boy] Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Go!
Run, Forrest!
Now, it used to be I ran to get where I was going.
I never thought it would take me anywhere.
Who in the hell is that? That there is Forrest Gump, coach.
-Just a local idiot. -[pants]
[Forrest] And can you believe it? I got to go to college, too.
-[fanfare playing] -[crowd cheering]
Forrest, move it! Run! Run!
-Okay! -Run!
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!
Run, son of a bitch, run! Go! Run!
Run! Run! Go!
He must be the stupidest son of a bitch alive,
-but he sure is fast. [laughs] -Yeah! [laughs]
[Forrest] Now, maybe it's just me, but college was very confusing times.
Federal troops enforcing a court order
integrated the University of Alabama today.
Two negroes were admitted but only after Governor George Wallace
Two negroes were admitted but only after Governor George Wallace had carried out his symbolic threat to stand in the schoolhouse door.

Governor Wallace, I take it from that, uh, statement that us…
Earl, what's going on?
-Coons are trying to get into school. -Coons?
When raccoons tried getting on our back porch,
-Mama just chased them off with a broom. -Not raccoons, you idiot. Niggers.
-Mama just chased them off with a broom. -Not raccoons, you idiot. Niggers. And they want to go to school with us.
With us? They do?

[Forrest] Ma'am, you dropped your book. Ma'am--
[Chet] Governor Wallace did what he promised to do.
By being on the Tuscaloosa campus, he kept the mob from gathering…
Say, wasn't that Gump?
No, that couldn't be. It sure as hell was.
[Forrest] A few years later, that angry little man at the schoolhouse door
that angry little man at the schoolhouse door thought it'd be a good idea and ran for president.
thought it'd be a good idea and ran for president.
[Forrest] But somebody thought that it wasn't.
-[vehicle approaching] -But he didn't die.
My bus is here.
-Is it the number nine? -No, it's the number four.
It was nice talking to you.
I remember when that happened, when Wallace got shot.
I was in college.
Did you go to a girls' college or a girls' and boys' together college?
-It was coed. -'Cause Jenny went to a college
-It was coed. -'Cause Jenny went to a college I couldn't go to. It was a college just for girls.
I couldn't go to. It was a college just for girls.
But I'd go and visit her every chance I got.
-♪ And that I want you only ♪ -[Jenny groans] That hurts!
-[thuds] -[Jenny] Forrest! Forrest!
-[Billy groaning] -Forrest, stop it! Stop it! What are you doing?
Stop it! What are you doing?
-He was hurting you. -What the hell is going on here?
-No, he wasn't! Get over there! -Who is that? Who is that?
-Billy, I'm sorry. -Just get away from me.
-Billy, I'm sorry. -Just get away from me. -Don't be such… Don't go. -Get… get… get away from me!
-Don't be such… Don't go. -Get… get… get away from me! Billy, wait a second.
-[engine starting] -He doesn't know any better.
Forrest, why'd you do that?
I brought you some chocolate.
I'm sorry.
I'll go back to my college now. Forrest--
Look at you.
Come on. Come on.
-Is this your own room? -Shh!
[Jenny] Do you ever dream, Forrest…
about who you're going to be?
Who I'm going to be?
-Yeah. -Aren't… aren't I going to be me?
You'll always be you, just another kind of you.
You know? I want to be famous.
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.
I just want to be… on an empty stage with my guitar, my voice.
on an empty stage with my guitar, my voice.
Just me.
And I want to reach people on a personal level.
I want to be able to say things, just one to one.
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?
I sit next to them in my home economics class all the time.
-Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. -[Jenny] It's okay.
It's all right.
-[Jenny] It's okay. -Oh, I'm dizzy.
I'll bet that never happened in home ec.
-No. -[chuckles]
I think I ruined your roommate's bathrobe.
[whispers] I don't care. I don't like her anyway.
[crowd cheering] Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!

Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Stop!
[Forrest] College ran by real fast 'cause I played so much football.
They even put me on a thing called the all-America team
where you get to meet the President of the United States.
[announcer] President Kennedy met with the collegiate
All-American football team at the Oval Office today.
[Forrest] Now the really good thing about meeting the president
[Forrest] Now the really good thing about meeting the president of the United States is the food.
They put you in this little room with just about anything
you'd want to eat or drink.
But since, number one, I wasn't hungry but thirsty,
and number two, they was free, I must have drank me about 15 Dr Peppers.
[Kennedy] Congratulations! How does it feel to be an All-American?
[man 1] It's an honor, sir.
[Kennedy] Congratulations! How does it feel to be an All-American?
[man 2] Very good, sir.
Congratulations! How does it feel to be an All-American?
[man 1] Very good, sir.
Congratulations. How do you feel? I got to pee.
[laughs] I believe he said he had to go pee.
[Forrest] Some time later, for no particular reason,
somebody shot that nice young president when he was riding in his car.
And a few years after that, somebody shot his little brother, too,
only he was in a hotel kitchen.
Must be hard being brothers.
I wouldn't know.
Forrest Gump.
[Forrest] Now can you believe it?
After only five years of playing football, I got a college degree.
Congratulations, son.
[Forrest] Mama was so proud.
Forrest, I'm so proud of you. Here, I'll hold this for you.
Congratulations, son.
Have you given any thought to your future?
Thought?
Hello. I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.
Nobody gives a horse's shit who you are, pus ball!
You're not even a low-life, scum-sucking maggot!
Get your faggoty ass on the bus! You're in the Army now!
[man 1] Seat's taken.
Taken.
[Forrest] At first, it seemed like I made a mistake,
seeing how it was only my induction day, and I was already getting yelled at.
You can sit down if you want to.
[Forrest] I didn't know who I might meet or what they might ask.
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?
No. But I been on a real big boat.
I'm talking about a shrimp-catching boat.
I been working on shrimp boats all my life.
I started out on my uncle's boat, that's my mama's brother,
when I was about maybe nine.
I was just looking into buying a boat of my own boat and got drafted.
My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue. People call me Bubba,
just like one of them old redneck boys. Can you believe that?
My name's Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump.
[Forrest] So, Bubba was from Bayou La Batre, Alabama,
and his mama cooked shrimp.
And her mama before her cooked shrimp,
and her mama before her mama cooked shrimp, too.
Bubba's family knew everything there was to know
Bubba's family knew everything there was to know about the shrimping business.
I know everything there is to know about the shrimping business.
Matter of fact, I'm going into the shrimping business for myself
after I get out of the Army.
Okay.
Gump! What's your sole purpose in this Army?
To do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant!
Goddammit, Gump, you're a goddamn genius!
That's the most outstanding answer I've ever heard.
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160. You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump.
Listen up, people!
[Forrest] Now for some reason, I fit in the Army like one of them round pegs.
It's not really hard.
You just make your bed real neat, and remember to stand up straight,
and always answer every question with, "Yes, Drill Sergeant."
[drill sergeant] Is that clear?
[all] Yes, Drill Sergeant!
What you do is, you just drag your nets along the bottom.
On a good day, you can catch over 100 pounds of shrimp.
Everything goes all right, two men shrimping ten hours,
less what you spends on gas,
-you can-- -Done, Drill Sergeant! Gump!
Why did you put that weapon together so quickly, Gump?
-You told me to, Drill Sergeant. -Jesus H. Christ.
-You told me to, Drill Sergeant. -Jesus H. Christ. This is a new company record.
If it wouldn't be a waste of such a damn fine enlisted man,
I'd recommend you for O.C.S., Private Gump.
You are gonna be a general someday, Gump! Now disassemble your weapon and continue!
Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea.
You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.
There's, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp creole,
shrimp gumbo, pan fried, deep fried, stir fried.
There's pineapple shrimp and lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp,
and lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp,
shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich.
shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich.
That… that's about it.
[Forrest] Nighttime in the Army is a lonely time.
We'd lay there in our bunks and I'd miss my mama,
and I'd miss Jenny.
Hey, Gump. Get a load of the tits on her.
[Forrest] Turns out Jenny had gotten into some trouble
over some photos of her in her college sweater.
And she was thrown out of school. ♪ My baby does the hanky panky ♪
[Forrest] But that wasn't a bad thing,
'cause a man who owns a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,
saw those photos and offered Jenny a job singing in a show.
The first chance I got,
I took the bus up to Memphis to see her perform in that show.
That was Amber, Amber Flame. Give her a big hand, guys! Good job, Amber!
And now, for your listening and viewing pleasure,

You can't keep doing this, Forrest.
You can't keep trying to rescue me all the time.
They was trying to grab you. [Jenny] A lot of people try to grab me.
Just-- You can't keep doing this all the time.
I can't help it. I love you.
Forrest… [sighs] …you don't know what love is.
You remember that time we prayed, Forrest?
We prayed for God to turn me into a bird so I could fly far, far away.
Yes, I do.
You think I could fly off this bridge?
What do you mean, Jenny?
Nothing.
-I got to get out of here. -[vehicle approaching]
[Forrest] Wait, Jenny.
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay? You just stay away from me, please.
Can I have a ride?
-[cab driver] Where are you going? -I don't care.
-[cab driver] Get in the truck. -So bye-bye, Jenny.
They sending me to Vietnam.
It's this whole other country.
Just hang on a minute.
Listen, you promise me something, okay?
Just-- If you're ever in trouble, don't try to be brave. You just run, okay? Just run away.
You just run, okay? Just run away.
Okay.
Jenny.
I'll write you all the time.
[Forrest] And just like that, she was gone.
You come back safe to me. Do you hear?
♪ It ain't me ♪ [Forrest] Now they told us that Vietnam was going to be very different
from the United States of America.
Except for all the beer cans and the barbecues, it was.
Hey, I'll bet there's shrimp all in these waters.
They tell me these Vietnams is good shrimp.
After we win this war and we take over everything,
we can get American shrimpers
to come out here and shrimp these waters. And just shrimp all the time, man.
[man] The right side of this.
You must be my FNG's.
-[Forrest] Morning, sir. -[Bubba] Morning, sir.
Oh, get your hands down. Do not salute me.
There are goddamn snipers all around this area
who'd love to grease an officer.
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor. Welcome to fort platoon.
What's wrong with your lip?
-I was born with big gums, sir. -Yeah? Well, you better tuck that in.
-I was born with big gums, sir. -Yeah? Well, you better tuck that in. Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.
Where are you boys from in the world?
-[Forrest] Alabama, sir! -[Bubba] Alabama, sir!
You twins?
No. We are not relations, sir.
Look, it's pretty basic here.
You stick with me and learn from the guys
who've been in country a while, you'll be all right.
There is one item of GI gear that can be the difference
There is one item of GI gear that can be the difference between a live grunt and a dead grunt…
socks. Cushioned sole, OD green.
Try and keep your feet dry. And when we're out humpin',
I want you boys to remember to change your socks whenever we stop.
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet right off his legs.
Sergeant Sims. Goddammit, where's that sling rope I said to order?
I put in the requisitions at battalion…
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you call those sons of bitches…
[Forrest] Lieutenant Dan sure knew his stuff. I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.
He was from a long, great military tradition.
Somebody in his family had fought and died…
in every… single… American war.
-Goddammit, kick some ass. -I'm on it, lieutenant.
Get on it!
[Forrest] I guess you could say he had a lot to live up to.
So, you boys from Arkansas, huh? Well… I been through there.
Little Rock's a fine town.
Now, go shake down your gear. See the platoon sergeant. Draw what you need for the field.
See the platoon sergeant. Draw what you need for the field.
If you boys are hungry, we got steaks burning right over here.
Two standing orders in this platoon--
One, take good care of your feet.
Two, try not to do anything stupid, like getting yourself killed. ♪ This is the worst trip I've ever been on ♪
I sure hope I don't let him down.
[Forrest] I got to see a lot of the countryside. We would take these real long walks.
[Forrest] And we were always lookin' for this guy named Charlie. ♪ There's too much confusion ♪
-[soldier 1] Hold it up! -[soldier 2] Hold up, boys!
[Forrest] It wasn't always fun.
Lieutenant Dan was always getting these funny feelings about a rock or a trail or the road,
about a rock or a trail or the road, so he'd tell us to… [imitates Dan] "Get down, shut up."
Get down! Shut up!
[Forrest whispers] So we did.
Now I don't know much about anything,
but I think some of America's best young men served in this war.
There was Dallas from Phoenix.
Cleveland, he was from Detroit.
[whispers] Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex. Man, what the hell's going on?
Hey, Tex. Man, what the hell's going on?
[Forrest] And Tex was-- Well, I don't remember where Tex come from.
[Dan] Ah, nothing.
Fourth platoon, on your feet.
Y'all got ten clicks to go to that river. Move out.
-["Soul Kitchen" playing] -[soldiers chanting]
[Dan] Step it up! Look alive out there.
[Forrest] The good thing about Vietnam is there was always someplace to go.
Fire in the hole!
Gump, check out that hole.
[Forrest] And there was always something to do.
-[Dan] Mount 'em up! -[soldier 1] Spread out! Cover his back!
[Forrest] One day it started raining, and it didn't quit for four months.
We've been through every kind of rain there is,
little bitty stinging rain…
and big ol' fat rain,
rain that flew in sideways,
and sometimes rain even seemed to come straight up from underneath.
Shoot, it even rained at night.
-[Bubba] Hey, Forrest. -[Forrest] Hey, Bubba.
I'm gon' to lean up against you. You lean your back against me.
This way we don't have to sleep with our heads in the mud.
You know why we're a good partnership, Forrest?
'cause we be watching out for one another, like brothers and stuff.
Hey, Forrest, somethin' I been thinking about.
I got a very important question to ask you.
How would you like to go into the shrimping business with me?
Okay.
Man, I tell you what. I got it all figured out, too.
So many pounds of shrimp will pay off the boat.
So many pounds for gas. We can just live right on the boat. We ain't got to pay no rent.
We can just live right on the boat. We ain't got to pay no rent.
I'll be the captain. We can just work it together,
split everything right down the middle. Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.
And hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can eat.
That's a fine idea.
[Forrest] Bubba did have a fine idea.
[Forrest] I even wrote Jenny and told her all about it.
I sent her letters. Not every day, but almost.
I told her what I was doin' and asked her what she was doin' and told her how I thought about her always.
and told her how I thought about her always.
And how I was looking forward to getting a letter from her
-just as soon as she had the time. -[dog barking]
[Forrest] I'd always let her know that I was okay.
Then I'd sign each letter "Love, Forrest Gump."
[Forrest] This one day, we was out walking like always,
and then, just like that,
somebody turned off the rain, and the sun come out.
-[shots firing] -[Dan] Ambush!
Take cover!
-[Dan] Get that pig up here, goddammit! -Forrest! You okay?
Strongarm, Strongarm!
Hey, Dan! We got a man down!
[Dan] Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6! Over!
Roger, Strongarm! Be advised we have incoming from the tree line at point blue plus two! A.K.s and rockets!
from the tree line at point blue plus two! A.K.s and rockets!
-[soldier 1] We're getting it hard! -[soldier 2] Misfire! Misfire!
-[bombs approaching, exploding] -Goddammit!
Get that pig unfucked and on the tree line!
They got us, and it hurt.
We're going to move 'em back to the blue line.
Pull back! Pull back!
Forrest! Run, Forrest!
-Pull back! -Run! Run! Run, man!
-Pull back! -Run! Run! Run, man! -Run! -[Dan] Pull back, Gump!
-Run! -[Dan] Pull back, Gump!
Run, goddammit! Run! Get the hell out of here!
[Forrest] I ran and ran just like Jenny told me to.
I ran so far so fast that pretty soon I was all by myself,
which was a bad thing.
Bubba.
[Forrest] Bubba was my best good friend. I had to make sure he was okay.
-[soldier] Keep running down there. -[Forrest panting]
Where the hell are you?
Bubba!
And on my way back to find Bubba,
well, there was this boy laying on the ground.
Tex.
Okay.
[Forrest] I couldn't let him lay there all alone, scared the way he was,
-so I grabbed him up… -[Tex groaning] [Forrest] …and run him out of there.
[Forrest] And every time I went back looking for Bubba,
somebody else was saying, "Help me, Forrest, help me!"
Okay. Here. Here.
Don't sweat, man. Just lay back. You'll be okay. You'll be okay.
I started to get scared that I might never find Bubba.
I know my position is danger close!
We got Charlie all over this area.
I got to have those fast movers in here now. Over.
[grunts] Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!
I know he's dead! My whole goddamn platoon is wiped out!
-[sobs] Goddammit! -[indistinct chatter radio]
-[sobs] Goddammit! -[indistinct chatter radio] What are you doing?
You leave me here! Get away. Just leave me here! Get out!
[groans, screams] God, I said leave me here, goddammit!
[man] Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6 this is Strongarm.
Be advised your fast movers are inbound at this time. Over.
[Forrest] Then it felt like somethin' just jumped up and bit me.
-[screams] Something bit me! -[Dan groans]
You dang son of a bitch!
I can't leave the platoon. I told you to leave me there, Gump.
I can't leave the platoon. I told you to leave me there, Gump. -Forget about me. Get yourself out! -[bombs exploding]
Did you hear what I said?
Gump, damn it, put me down.
Get your ass out of here. [groans]
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there, god damn, you--
-Where the hell do you think you're going? -To get Bubba.
[Dan] I got an air strike inbound right now. They're gonna nape the whole area.
Gump, you stay here! Goddammit! That's an order.
I gotta find Bubba!
Forrest.
-Bubba. -I'm okay, Forrest.
I'm okay.
[hesitating] Oh… oh, Bubba, no.
[Bubba] I'll be all right.
-Come on. Come on. Come on. -[Bubba groaning]
[groaning] I'm okay, Forrest.
-[airplanes approaching] -[groans] I'm okay, Forrest. I'm fine. [groans]
[Dan] Top smoke. Get it up there.
[Forrest] If I'd have known this was gonna be the last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,
I'd of thought of something better to say.
Hey, Bubba.
[pants] Hey, Forrest.
Forrest… why did this happen?
[Forrest] You got shot.
Then Bubba said something I won't ever forget.
I want to go home.
[Forrest] Bubba was my best good friend.
And even I know that ain't something you can find just around the corner.
Bubba was gonna be a shrimping boat captain,
but instead, he died right there by that river in Vietnam.
That's all I have to say about that.
It was a bullet, wasn't it?
A bullet? That jumped up and bit you.
Oh. Yes, sir.
Bit me directly in the buttocks.
They said it was a million-dollar wound but… the Army must keep that money 'cause I still ain't seen
the Army must keep that money 'cause I still ain't seen a nickel of that million dollars.
The only good thing about being wounded in the buttocks is the ice cream.
They gave me all the ice cream I could eat.
And guess what? A good friend of mine was in the bed right next door.
Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice cream.
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!
[nurse] It's time for your bath, lieutenant.

Gump, how can you watch that stupid shit? Turn it off.
[announcer] You are tuned to the American Forces Vietnam Network.
This is Channel 6, Saigon.
-[soldier] Good catch, Gump. -[ball bounces]
You know how to play this?
Come on. Let me show you. Here.
Now, the secret to this game is, no matter what happens,
Now, the secret to this game is, no matter what happens, never, ever… take your eye off the ball.
All right. -["Hello, I Love You" playing] -[ping-pong ball bouncing]
[Forrest] For some reason, ping-pong came very natural to me.
See? Any idiot can play.
[Forrest] So I started playing it all the time.
I played ping-pong even when I didn't have anyone to play ping-pong with.
[Forrest] The hospital's people said it made me look like a duck in water,
whatever that means.
Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play.
I played ping-pong so much, I even played it in my sleep.
[breathes heavily] Now, you listen to me. We all have a destiny.
Nothing just happens. It's all part of a plan!
I should have died out there with my men,
but now I'm nothing but a goddamn cripple,
a legless freak! Look. Look! Look at me!
You see that? Do you know what it's like not to be able to use your legs?
W… y… y… yes, sir, I do.
Did you hear what I said? [breathes heavily]
You cheated me!
I had a destiny. I was supposed to die in the field
I had a destiny. I was supposed to die in the field with honor!
That was my destiny, and you… cheated me out of it!
Do you understand what I'm saying, Gump?
This wasn't supposed to happen-- Not to me.
I had a destiny. [pants]
I was… Lieutenant… Dan Taylor.
[hesitates] Y… you still Lieutenant Dan.
Look at me.
What am I gonna do now? [panting]
What am I gonna do now?
PFC Gump?
Yes, sir!
As you were.
Son, you been awarded the Medal of Honor.
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan. They want to give me a Med--
Ma'am. What'd they do with Lieutenant Dan?
They sent him home.
[Forrest] Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.
The ceremony was kicked off with a candid speech by the president
regarding the need for further escalation of the war in Vietnam.
President Johnson awarded four Medals of Honor to men
President Johnson awarded four Medals of Honor to men from each of the armed services.
America owes you a debt of gratitude, son.
I understand you were wounded. Where were you hit?
In the buttocks, sir. Well, that must be a sight. [whispers] I'd kinda like to see that.
Well, that must be a sight. [whispers] I'd kinda like to see that.
♪ God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson ♪ -Goddamn, son! -♪ Heaven holds a place ♪
[Forrest] After that, Mama went to the hotel to lay down,
so I went out for a walk to see our nation's capital.
[Isabel] Hilary, all right, I've got the vets, What do you want me to do with them? What are you doing here so late?
What do you want me to do with them? What are you doing here so late?

'cause the streets was awful crowded with people lookin' at all the statues and monuments,
and some of them people were loud and pushy.
Okay, follow me! Come on, let's move it out!
[Forrest] Everywhere I went, I had to stand in line.
[Isabel] Come on. Go!
[Hilary] Stay here.
Hey, you're a good man for doing this. Good!
Okay.
[Forrest] There was this man giving a little talk.
And for some reason, he was wearing an American flag for a shirt.
[Abbie] I'm gonna bring up some soldiers…
[Forrest] And he liked to say the "f-word" a lot. "F" this and "f" that.
And every time he said the "F" word,
people, for some reason, well, they'd cheer.
-[feedback screeching] -[cheering] -[Abbie] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! -[crowd cheering]
-[Abbie] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! -[crowd cheering]

Shut that blind, man! And get your white ass away from that window.
Don't you know we in a war here?
Hey, man. He's cool. He's one of us.
-Let me tell you about us. -Where the hell have you been?
Our purpose here is to protect our black leaders

rape our women, and destroy our black communities.
Who's the baby killer?
This is my good friend I told you about. This is Forrest Gump.
Forrest, this is Wesley.
Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,
and he's the president of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.
Let me tell you something else. We are here to offer protection
Let me tell you something else. We are here to offer protection and help for all those who need our help,

Yes. We are against any war where black soldiers go to fight

Forrest!
-[Wesley groaning] -Stop it! Stop it!
I shouldn't have brought you here.
I should have known it was gonna be some bullshit hassle!
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.
Come on, Forrest.
Sorry I had a fight in the middle of your Black Panther party.
He doesn't mean it when he does things like this. He doesn't.

That uniform is a trip, Forrest.
You look handsome in it. You do.
-You know what? -What?
I'm glad we were here together in our nation's capital.
Me, too, Forrest.
[Forrest] We walked around all night, Jenny and me, just talkin'.
[Forrest] She told me about all the traveling she'd done
and how she discovered ways to expand her mind
and learn how to live in harmony…
which must be out west somewhere,

[Forrest] Some years later, that nice young man from England
was on his way home to see his little boy
and was signing some autographs.
For no particular reason at all, somebody shot him.
They gave you… the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.
-[car horn honking] -Lieutenant Dan!
They gave you… the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Yes, sir. They surely did.
[Dan] They gave you,
an imbecile, a moron who goes on television and makes a fool out of himself
a moron who goes on television and makes a fool out of himself in front of the whole damn country,
the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Yes, sir.
Well… that… that's just perfect!
Yeah, well, I just got one thing to say to that-- Goddamn bless America.
Oh. Oh. Hey, hey! [grunts]
Whoa-- Oh, god, whoa!
[groans] Oh! Oh, God! -[thudding] -Lieutenant Dan!
[Forrest] Lieutenant Dan said he was living in a hotel
and because he didn't have no legs,
he spent most of his time exercising his arms.
[Dan] Take a right. Take a right! ♪ I don't hear a word they're saying ♪
-[taxi driver] Hey! -[taxi horn honking] -[Dan] Ah, ah! -[taxi driver] Come on, already!
[Forrest] What are you doing here in New York, Lieutenant Dan?
I'm living off the government tit.
-[horn honks] -Sucking it dry.
Hey, hey, hey, are you blind?
Why don't you go home before you kill yourself? -I'm walking here! -Get out of the way!
Ah, get out! Come on. Go, go, go!
[Forrest] I stayed with Lieutenant Dan and celebrated the holidays.
You have a great year, and hurry home. God bless you. -[crowd applauding, cheering] -[fanfare playing]
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?
I didn't know I was supposed to be looking for him, sir.
That's all these cripples down at the V.A.,
that's all they ever talk about.
Jesus this and Jesus that. [laughs]
Have I found Jesus?
They even had a priest come and talk to me.
He said God is listening, but I have to help myself.
Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart,
I'll get to walk beside him in the Kingdom of Heaven.
Did you hear what I said?
Walk… beside him in the Kingdom of Heaven.
Well, kiss my crippled ass. God is listening?
Well, kiss my crippled ass. God is listening? What a crock of shit!
I'm going to Heaven, Lieutenant Dan.
Oh?
Well…
before you go… why don't you get your ass down to the corner
-and get us more Ripple? -Yes, sir.
We're at approximately 45th street in New York City at One Astor Plaza.
This is the site of the old Astor Hotel.
[Dan] What the hell is in Bayou La Batre?
[Forrest] Shrimping boats. [Dan] Shrimping boats? Who gives a shit about shrimping boats?
[Dan] Shrimping boats? Who gives a shit about shrimping boats?
[Forrest] I gotta buy me one of them shrimpin' boats
soon as I have some money. I made me a promise to Bubba in Vietnam,
that as soon as the war was over, we'd go in partners.
He'd be the captain of the shrimpin' boat and I'd be his first mate.
But now that he's dead, I… that means I got to be the captain.
A shrimp boat captain? Yes, sir. A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.
Yes, sir. A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.
Now hear this! [laughs]
Private Gump here is gonna be a shrimp boat captain. [laughs]
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan. The day that you are a shrimp boat captain,
I will come and be your first mate. [laughs]
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain, that's the day I'm an astronaut!
Danny, what are you complaining about? [shrieks]
-Danny, how you doing, huh? -Mr. Hot Wheels!
-Who's your friend? -My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.
-[laughs] -This is Cunning Carla and Long-Limbs Lenore.
-[laughs] -[chuckles] So, where you been, babycakes, huh? Haven't seen you around lately.
So, where you been, babycakes, huh? Haven't seen you around lately. You know, you should have been here for Christmas,
You know, you should have been here for Christmas, cause Tommy bought a round on the house and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

Well, well, I had, uh… company.

Don't you just love New Year's? -You can start all over. -Hey, Lenore.
-You can start all over. -Hey, Lenore. Everybody gets a second chance.
[Forrest] It's funny, but in the middle of all that fun,
I began to think about Jenny,
[Forrest] …wondering how she was spending her new year's night out in California.
[crowd] Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
five, four, three, two, one!
[all] Happy new year!
Happy new year, Lieutenant Dan! ♪ Should auld acquaintance be forgot ♪
Oh! What are you, stupid or something? What's your problem?
-[laughs] -What's his problem?
Did… did you lose your pecker in the war or something?
-What, is your friend stupid or something? -What did you say?
I said, "Is your friend stupid or something?"
[grunts] Don't call him stupid!

Get your goddamned clothes

-Go on! Get outta here! -You big loser!
[Carla] Come on, Lenore, we don't need this shit. -Get out of here! [grunts] -[gasps, laughs]
-You retard! -Loser. You freak!
Oh, no. No.
I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.
She tastes like cigarettes.
[Forrest] I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's some things you just can't change.
He didn't want to be called crippled
just like I didn't want to be called stupid.
Happy new year, Gump.
The U.S. ping-pong team
met with President Nixon today at an Oval Office ceremony……
Wouldn't you know it… a few months later,
they invited me and the ping-pong team to visit the White House.
So I went… again.
And I met the president of the United States again.
Only this time, they didn't get us rooms in a real fancy hotel.
So, are you enjoying yourself in our nation's capital, young man?
-Yes, sir. -Well, where are you staying?
It's called the Hotel Ebbott. Oh, no, no, no. I know a much nicer hotel.
Oh, no, no, no. I know a much nicer hotel. It's brand-new. Very modern. I'll have my people take care of it for you.
It's brand-new. Very modern. I'll have my people take care of it for you.

you might want to send a maintenance man over to that office across the way.
The lights are off and they must be looking for a fuse box,
or something 'cause them flashlights, the… they're keeping me awake.
[security guard] Okay, sir. I'll check it out.
-[Forrest] Thank you. -[security guard] No problem.
-[Forrest] Goodnight. -[security guard] Goodnight.
Therefore… I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
Vice President Ford
will be sworn in as president at that hour in this office.
As I recall the high hopes for America with which we began this second term…
Forrest Gump.
-Yes, sir! -As you were.
I have your discharge papers. Service is up, son.
Does this mean I can't play ping-pong no more?
[officer] For the Army, it does.
[Forrest] And just like that, my service in the United States Army was over.
So I went home.
I'm home, Mama. I know. I know.
-Louise, he's here. -[Forrest] Now, when I got home,
-I had no idea… -He's here, everybody! [Forrest] …but Mama had all sorts of visitors.
We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest.
Everybody wants you to use their ping-pong stuff.
One man even left a check for 25,000 dollars
if you'd be agreeable to sayin' you like using their paddle.
Oh, but, Mama. I only like using my own paddle.
-Hi, Miss Louise. -Hey, Forrest.
I know that, I know that but it's 25,000 dollars, Forrest.
I thought maybe you could hold it for a while, see if it grows on you.
[Forrest] That mama, she sure was right. It's funny how things work out.
I didn't stay home for long because I'd made a promise to Bubba,
-and I always try to keep my promise. -[children clamoring]
[Forrest] So I went on down to Bayou La Batre
to meet Bubba's family and make their introduction.
Are you crazy or just plain stupid?
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.
I guess.
[Forrest] And, of course, I paid my respect to Bubba himself.
Hey, Bubba. It's me, Forrest Gump.
I remember everything you said, and I got it all figured out.
I'm taking the 24,562 dollars and 47 cent.
that I got, that it… that's left after a new haircut and a new suit and took Mama out to a real fancy dinner,
after a new haircut and a new suit and took Mama out to a real fancy dinner,
and I bought a bus ticket, then three Dr. Peppers.
[shrimper] Tell me something.
-Are you stupid or something? -Stupid is as stupid does, sir.
Well, that's what's left after me saying,
"When I was in China on the all-America ping-pong team,
I just loved playing ping-Pong with my Flex-O-Lite ping-pong paddle,"
which everybody knows isn't true, but Mama said
it was just a little white lie, so it wouldn't hurt nobody.
[inhales] So anyway, I'm putting all that on gas ropes, and new nets and a brand-new shrimpin' boat.
ropes, and new nets and a brand-new shrimpin' boat.
[Forrest] Now Bubba told me everything he knew about shrimping,
but you know what I found out?
Shrimping is tough.
I only caught five.
A couple more, you can have yourself a cocktail. [chuckles]
Hey, you ever think about namin' this old boat?
It's bad luck to have a boat without a name.
[Forrest] I'd never named a boat before, but there was only one I could think of,
the most beautiful name in the wide world.
[Forrest] Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny in a long while,
but I thought about her a lot.
And I hoped whatever she was doin' made her happy.
[Forrest] I thought about Jenny all the time.
Hey!
Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here?
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.
Well, you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan.
Yes, I know that.
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump. I had to see this for myself. [chuckles]
And… I told you if you were ever a shrimp boat captain,
that I'd be your first mate. Well, here I am. I'm a man of my word.
that I'd be your first mate. Well, here I am. I'm a man of my word. Okay.
Yeah, but don't you be thinking that I'm going to be calling you "sir."
No, sir.
It's my boat.
[Dan] I have a feeling if we head due east, we'll find some shrimp, so take a left.
we'll find some shrimp, so take a left.
-Take a left! -[Forrest] Which way?
Over there! They're over there!
Get… get on the wheel and take a left. Okay.
Gump, what are you doing? Take a left! Left!
That's where we're gonna find those shrimp, my boy! [laughs]
That's where we'll find them.
-Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan. -Okay, so I was wrong.
Well, how are we gonna find them?
Well, maybe you should just pray for shrimp.
♪ Still praying as I onward bound ♪
[Forrest] So I went to church every Sunday.
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,
though I think he left the praying up to me.
No shrimp. Where the hell's this God of yours?
It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that 'cause right then, God showed up.
[Dan] You'll never sink this boat! Now, me, I was scared… -[Dan laughing] Whoo! -[Forrest] …but Lieutenant Dan,
-[Dan laughing] Whoo! -[Forrest] …but Lieutenant Dan, -he was mad. -[Dan] Come on!
-he was mad. -[Dan] Come on!
You call this a storm? Blow, you son of a bitch! Blow!
It's time for a showdown! You and me!
I'm right here! Come and get me! [laughing hysterically]
You'll never sink this boat! [laughing hysterically]
Hurricane Carmen came through here yesterday,
destroying nearly everything in its path.
And as in other towns up and down the coast,
Bayou La Batre's entire shrimping industry
has fallen victim to carmen and has been left in utter ruin.
Speaking with local officials, this reporter has learned,
in fact, only one shrimping boat actually survived the storm.
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.
[Forrest] After that, shrimping was easy.
[Forrest] And since people still needed them shrimps for shrimp cocktails and barbecues and all and we were the only boat left standin',
for shrimp cocktails and barbecues and all and we were the only boat left standin',
Bubba Gump Shrimp's what they got.
We got a whole bunch of boats. Twelve Jennys.
A big ol' warehouse. We even have hats that say "Bubba Gump" on them.
Bubba Gump Shrimp. -It's a household name. -Hold on there, boy.
-It's a household name. -Hold on there, boy.
Are you tellin' me you're the owner of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation?
Yes. We got more money than Davy Crockett. [laughs] Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,
[laughs] Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time, but that tops 'em all. [laughing]
We were sittin' next to a millionaire.
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,
and you tell it so well, with such enthusiasm.
Would you like to see what Lieutenant Dan looks like?
[woman] Well, yes, I would.
[Forrest] That's him right there.
-Mm. -[Forrest] And let me tell you something about Lieutenant Dan.
Forrest…
I never thanked you for saving my life.
[Forrest] He never actually said so, but I think he made his peace with God.

President Ford escaped possible assassination today.

-Jenny 1. Go, Margo. -[Margo] Forrest has a phone call.
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them to call him back.
-He is indisposed at the moment. -[Margo] His mama's sick.
-Where's Mama? -She's upstairs.
Hi, Forrest.
-[doctor] I'll see you tomorrow. -Oh, all right.
We sure got you straightened out, didn't we, boy?
What's the matter, Mama? I'm dying, Forrest.
Come on in, sit down over here.
Why are you dying, Mama? It's my time.
It's just my time.
Oh, now… don't you be afraid, sweetheart.
Death is just a part of life.
Something we're all destined to do.
I didn't know it, but I was destined to be your mama.
I did the best I could. [Forrest] You did good, Mama.
Well… I happen to believe you make your own destiny.
You have to do the best with what God gave you.
What's my destiny, Mama?
You're gonna have to figure that out for yourself.
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.
You never know what you're gonna get.
[Forrest] Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.
I will miss you, Forrest.
She had got the cancer and died on a Tuesday.
I bought her a new hat with little flowers on it.
And that's all I have to say about that.
Didn't you say you were waiting for the number seven bus?
There'll be another one along shortly.
Now because I had been a football star and a war hero
and national celebrity and a shrimping boat captain
and a college graduate, the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama,
decided to get together and offered me a fine job.
So I… I never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan.
Though he did take care of my Bubba Gump money.
He got me invested in some kind of fruit company.
And so then I got a call from him saying,
"We don't have to worry about money no more." And I said,
"That's good. One less thing."
♪ I've got a new hope… ♪
Now Mama said there's only so much fortune a man really needs,
-and the rest is just for showing off. -[reverend] Praise the Lord.
[Forrest] So I gave a whole bunch of it to the Foursquare Gospel Church,
And I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital
[Forrest] And even though Bubba was dead and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.
And you know what?
She didn't have to work in nobody's kitchen no more.
That smells wonderful.
And 'cause I was a gozillionaire and I liked doing it so much,
I cut that grass for free.
But at nighttime when there was nothing to do,
and the house was all empty,
I'd always think of Jenny.
[Forrest] And then… she was there.
Hello, Forrest. Hello, Jenny.
[Forrest] Jenny came back and stayed with me.
Maybe it was because she had nowhere else to go,
or maybe it was because she was so tired 'cause she went to bed and slept and slept
or maybe it was because she was so tired 'cause she went to bed and slept and slept like she hadn't slept in years.
It was wonderful havin' her home.
Every day we'd take a walk, and I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,
and she'd listen about ping-ponging and shrimping
and Mama makin' a trip up to heaven. I did all the talking. Jenny, most of the time, was real quiet.
I did all the talking. Jenny, most of the time, was real quiet. …and rain and rain--
[sobs] How could you do… those things?
Sometimes I guess there just aren't enough rocks.
[Forrest] I never really knew why she came back, but I didn't care. It was like olden times.
but I didn't care. It was like olden times. We was like peas and carrots again.
Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers and put them in her room for her,
-and she gave me the best gift… -Okay, you can open your eyes. [Forrest] …anyone could ever get in the wide world.
[Forrest] …anyone could ever get in the wide world. They make them just for running.
[Forrest] And she even showed me how to dance.

Why don't you love me, Jenny?
I'm not a smart man,
but I know what love is.
Jenny--
Forrest, I do love you.
Where are you running off to? I'm not running.
[Forrest] That day, for no particular reason, I decided to go for a little run.
So I ran to the end of the road, and when I got there, I thought maybe I'd run to the end of town.
and when I got there, I thought maybe I'd run to the end of town.
[reporter] President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion…

I thought maybe I'd just run across Greenbow County.
Now, I figured since I run this far,
maybe I'd just run across the great State of Alabama.
And that's what I did.
I ran clear across Alabama.
For no particular reason. I just kept on goin'.
I ran clear to the ocean.
[Forrest] And when I got there, I figured since I'd gone this far,
might as well turn around, just keep on going.
And when I got to another ocean, I figured since I'd gone this far…
I might as well just turn back and keep right on going.
When I got tired, I slept. When I got hungry, I ate.
When I had to go… you know…
I went.
[chuckles] And so… you just ran.
Yeah.
-♪ Runnin' on… ♪ -[Forrest] I'd think a lot… about Mama and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.
But most of all, I thought about Jenny.

[reporter] Why are you doing this?
I just felt like running.
I just felt like runnin'.
That's you. I can't believe it's really you.
Now…for some reason, what I was doing seemed to make sense to people.
I mean, it was like an alarm went off in my head, you know?
I said, "Here's a guy that's got his act together."
"Here's somebody who's got it all figured out."
"Here's somebody who has the answer." I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.
[Forrest] So I got company.
[Forrest] And after that, I got more company. And then, even more people joined in.
Somebody later told me it gave people hope.
Now… now, I don't know anything about that,
but some of those people asked me if I could help them out.
Hey, man! Hey, listen. I was wondering if you might help me, huh?
Listen, I'm in the bumper sticker business.

Sometimes it would stop raining long enough for the stars to come out.
And then it was nice.
It was like just before the sun goes to bed down on the bayou.
There was always a million sparkles on the water…
like that mountain lake. It was so clear, Jenny,
it looked like there were… two skies, one on top of the other.
And then in the desert, when the sun comes up…
I couldn't tell where… heaven stopped
and the earth began.
It was so beautiful.
I wish I could've been there with you.
You were.
I love you.
[Forrest] You died on a Saturday morning.
And I had you placed here under our tree.
And I had that house of your father's bulldozed to the ground.
Mama…
always said that dyin' was a part of life.
I sure wish it wasn't.
Little Forrest is… he doin' just fine.
"But…"
[Forrest] About to start school again soon,
and I make his breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day.
I make sure he… combs his hair and brushes his teeth every day.
Teaching him how to play ping-pong.
Okay!
[Forrest] He's really good.
Uh, Forrest, you go. [grunts]
We fish a lot.
And every night, we read a book. He's just so smart, Jenny.
[sniffles] You'd be so proud of him.
I am.
He, uh, wrote you a… a letter.
And he says I can't read it. I'm not supposed to,
And he says I can't read it. I'm not supposed to, so I'll just leave it here for you.
Jenny… [hesitates]
I don't know if Mama was right or if it… if it's Lieutenant Dan.
I don't know…
if we each have a… destiny…
or if we're all just floatin' around accidental-like on a breeze…
but I… I think…
maybe it's both.
Maybe both is happening at the same time.
But I miss you, Jenny.
If there's anything you need… I won't be far away.
Here's your bus. Okay.
Hey. I know this.
I'm gonna share that for show-and-tell because grandma used to read it to you.
My favorite book.
[Forrest] Here we are.
Hey.
Here you go.
Hey, Forrest… don't--
I wanted to tell you I love you. I love you, too, Daddy.
I'll be right here when you get back.
General.
General.
Sir. General.
Sir. General.
General.
[MAN SHOUTS] Sir.
Lean and hungry.
Still nothing? Not a sign.
How long has he been gone? Nearly two hours.
Will they fight, sir? We shall know soon enough.
Soldier, I ordered you to move those catapults forward.
They're out of range. Range is good.
The danger to the cavalry-- It is acceptable. Agreed?
They say no.
[WHINNYING] Steady! Steady!
People should know when they're conquered.
Would you, Quintus? Would I?
Strength and honor. Strength and honor. Strength and honor.
Strength and honor. Strength and honor.
At my signal, unleash hell.
Load the catapults.
Infantry form up for advance.
Archers ready. Archers!
Nock! Nock!
Patres! MEN: Maximus!
Three weeks from now, I will be harvesting my crops.
Imagine where you will be,
and it will be so.
Hold the line! Stay with me!
If you find yourself alone,
riding in green fields with the sun on your face,
do not be troubled. For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!
Brothers,
what we do in life... echoes in eternity.
Pull!
Pull!
Pull!
MAN: Catapults ready, sir!
Archers, ignite!
Ignite!
Ignite!
MAN: Archers, draw!
Loose!
Loose!
MAN: All right, men, ready!
MAXIMUS: Hold the line!
Draw! Loose!
Loose! Loose!
Reload!
MAXIMUS: Hold the line!
Draw!
Loose!
MAXIMUS: Stay with me!
Stay with me!
MAXIMUS: Roma Victor!
[IN UNISON] Roma Victor!
Roma Victor!
Do you think he's really dying?
He's been dying for 10 years.
If he weren't really dying, he wouldn't have sent for us.
Maybe he just misses us.
And the senators? He wouldn't have summoned them-- Peace, Commodus.
He wouldn't have summoned them-- Peace, Commodus. After two weeks on the road,
After two weeks on the road, your incessant scheming is hurting my head.
He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.
He will name me.
The first thing I shall do...
when--
Is honor him with games worthy of His Majesty.
For now, the first thing I shall do is have a hot bath.
MAN: Your Highness?
MAN: We seem to be almost there, sir.
Sire. Where's the Emperor?
He's at the front, sire. They've been gone for 19 days.
The wounded are still coming in.
My horse.
MAN: My lord.
Kiss?
You have proved your valor... yet again, Maximus.
Let us hope for the last time.
There's no one left to fight, sire.
Ah. There is always someone left to fight.
How can I reward Rome's greatest general?
Let me go home.
Ah. Home.
They honor you, Caesar.
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.
MAN: Roma Victor!
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?
You have missed the war.
Father, congratulations.
I shall sacrifice a hundred bulls to honor your triumph.
Save the bulls.
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.
General. Highness.
Rome salutes you, and I embrace you as a brother.
It has been too long, my old friend. Highness. Here, Father.
Highness. Here, Father.
Take my arm.
I think it is time for me to leave.
So much for the glory of Rome.
Magnificent battle.
General. Still alive? Still alive?
The gods must have a sense of humor. The gods must love you. Valerius.
The gods must love you. Valerius.
Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?
Home. My wife, the son, the harvest.
Maximus the farmer. I still have difficulty imagining that.
You know, dirt cleans off a lot easier than blood, Quintus.
There he is. Highness.
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear,
and you'll wake up one day, and all you'll say is, "Republic, republic, republic."
Well, why not? Rome was founded as a republic.
Yes, and in a republic the Senate has the power.
But Senator Gaius isn't influenced by that, of course.
Where do you stand, General? Emperor or Senate?
The soldier has the advantage of being able to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.
GAIUS: Well, with an army behind you, you could be extremely political.
I warned you. Now I shall save you. Senators.
Maximus.
I'm going to need good men like you.
How may I be of service, Highness?
You're a man who knows what it is to command.
You give your orders, the orders are obeyed, and the battle is won.
the orders are obeyed, and the battle is won.
But these senators,
they scheme and squabble and flatter and deceive.
Maximus, we must save Rome from the politicians, my friend.
Can I count on you... when the time comes?
Highness, when your father releases me,
I intend to return home.
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.
Don't get too comfortable. I may call on you before long.
Lucilla's here. Did you know?
She's not forgotten you.
And now you're the great man.
If only you had been born a man.
What a caesar you would have made.
Father.
You would have been strong.
I wonder, would you have been just?
I would have been what you taught me to be.
How was your journey?
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come?
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come? I need your help. With your brother.
I need your help. With your brother.
[CHUCKLING] Of course.
He loves you. He always has.
And...
he will need you now more than ever.
Enough of politics.
Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter...
and I am a good father.
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?
MAN: Good morning.
MAN: I need three more horses.
COMMODUS: Two! Three!
Four! [BLADES CLANKING]
One! Two!
You sent for me, Caesar?
Caesar?
Tell me again, Maximus. Why are we here?
For the glory of the Empire, sire.
Ah, yes.
Ah, yes, I remember.
Do you see that map, Maximus?
That is the world which I created.
For 25 years...
I have conquered, spilt blood, expanded the Empire.
Since I became caesar, I've known four years without war.
Four years of peace in 20.
And for what?
I brought the sword. Nothing more.
Caesar, your life--
Please. Please don't call me that.
Come. Please.
Come sit.
Let us talk together now...
very simply, as men.
Well, Maximus... talk.
Five thousand of my men are out there in the freezing mud.
Three thousand of them are bloodied and cleaved. Two thousand will never leave this place.
I will not believe that they fought and died for nothing.
And what would you believe, Maximus--? They fought for you... And for Rome.
They fought for you... And for Rome.
And what is Rome, Maximus?
I've seen much of the rest of the world.
It is brutal and cruel and dark. Rome is the light.
Yet you have never been there.
You have not seen what it has become.
I am dying, Maximus.
When a man sees his end,
he wants to know there was some purpose to his life.
How will the world speak my name in years to come?
Will I be known as the philosopher?
The warrior? The tyrant?
Or will I be the emperor who gave Rome back her true self?
There was once a dream that was Rome.
You could only whisper it.
Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish.
It was so fragile.
And I fear that it will not survive the winter.
Maximus,
let us whisper now,
together, you and I.
You have a son.
Tell me about your home.
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.
A very simple place.
Pink stones that warm in the sun.
A kitchen garden that smells of herbs in the day,
jasmine in the evening.
Through the gate is a giant poplar. Figs, apples, pears.
The soil, Marcus-- Black.
Black like my wife's hair. [CHUCKLES]
Grapes on the south slopes, olives on the north.
Wild ponies play near my house. They tease my son. He wants to be one of them.
They tease my son. He wants to be one of them.
When was the last time you were home? Two years, 264 days, and this morning.
I envy you, Maximus.
It's a good home. Worth fighting for?
There is one more duty...
that I ask of you before you go home.
What would you have me do, Caesar?
I want you to become the protector of Rome after I die.
I will empower you to one end alone.
To give power back to the people of Rome...
and end the corruption that has crippled it.
Will you accept this great honor that I have offered you?
With all my heart, no.
Maximus,
that is why it must be you.
But surely a prefect, a senator, somebody who knows the city,
somebody who knows the city, who understands her politics.
But you have not been corrupted by her politics.
And Commodus? Commodus is not a moral man.
You have known that since you were young.
Commodus cannot rule.
He must not rule.
You are the son that I should have had.
Commodus will accept my decision.
He knows that you command the loyalty of the army.
I.. I need some time, sire.
Yes.
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.
Now embrace me as my son.
And bring an old man another blanket.
LUCILLA: My father favors you now. My lady.
It was not always so.
Many things change. Many things. Not everything.
Many things. Not everything.
Maximus, stop.
Let me see your face.
Hm. You seem upset.
I lost many men.
What did my father want with you?
[SIGHING] To wish me well before I leave for home.
You're lying. I could always tell when you were lying
because you were never any good at it.
I never acquired your comfort with it. True.
But then you never had to.
Life is more simple for a soldier.
Or do you think me heartless?
I think you have a talent for survival.
Maximus, stop.
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?
No. I'm tired from battle.
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.
Commodus expects that my father will announce his succession within days.
Will you serve my brother as you served his father?
I will always serve Rome.
Do you know, I still remember you in my prayers.
Oh, yes. I pray.
I was sad to hear of your husband's death. I mourned him.
Thank you. And I hear you have a son.
Yes. Lucius.
He'll be nearly 8 years old.
My son is also nearly 8.
I thank you for your prayers.
MAXIMUS: Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.
Blessed mother, come to me with the gods' desire for my future.
Blessed father, watch over my wife and son with a ready sword.
Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again.
Ancestors, I honor you...
and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.
Cicero?
Sir.
You don't find it hard to do your duty?
Sometimes I do what I want to do.
The rest of the time I do what I have to.
We may not be able to go home after all.
MARCUS: Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?
Yes, Father.
You will not be emperor.
Which wiser, older man is to take my place?
My powers will pass to Maximus...
to hold in trust... until the Senate is ready to rule once more.
Rome is to be a republic again.
Maximus. Yes.
My decision disappoints you?
You wrote to me once,
listing the four chief virtues.
Wisdom,
justice, fortitude...
and temperance.
As I read the list, I knew I had none of them.
But I have other virtues, Father.
Ambition.
That can be a virtue when it drives us to excel.
Resourcefulness. Courage.
Perhaps not on the battlefield, but... there are many forms of courage.
Devotion... to my family...
and to you.
But none of my virtues were on your list.
Even then it was as if you didn't want me for your son.
Oh, Commodus.
You go too far.
I search the faces of the gods... for ways to please you, to make you proud.
for ways to please you, to make you proud.
One kind word,
one full hug...
where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight,
would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years.
What is it in me you hate so much? Shh, Commodus.
Shh, Commodus.
All I've ever wanted... was to live up to you, Caesar.
was to live up to you, Caesar.
Father.
Commodus...
...your faults as a son is my failure as a father.
Come.
[SOBBING] Father.
I would butcher the whole world... if you would only love me!
Maximus, the emperor needs you. It's urgent.
Lament with me, brother. Our great father is dead.
MAXIMUS: How did he die?
COMMODUS: The surgeons say there was no pain.
His breath gave out as he slept.
Father.
Your emperor asks for your loyalty, Maximus.
Take my hand.
I only offer it once.
Quintus.
Hail, Caesar.
I must talk to the senators. I need their counsel.
Wake Gaius and Falco. Gaius and Falco.
Sword. Sword.
Maximus, please be careful. That was not prudent.
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.
QUINTUS: The Emperor died of natural causes.
Why are you armed, Quintus? Guards!
Please don't fight, Maximus.
QUINTUS: I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.
Ride until dawn... and then execute him.
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!
Promise me that you will look after my family.
Your family will meet you in the afterlife. No!
Kneel.
MAXIMUS: Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son.
Whisper to them that I live only to hold them again.
At least give me a clean death.
A soldier's death.
The frost--
Sometimes it makes the blade stick.
Praetorian!
MARCUS: When was the last time you were home?
MAXIMUS: Two years, 264 days, and this morning.
BOTH [OVERLAPPING]: Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son with a ready sword.
Whisper to them I live only to hold them again.
For all else is dust and air. Whisper to them I live only to hold them again.
Whisper to them I live only to hold them again.
For all else is dust and air.
[HORSES NEIGHING] Papa! Papa!
Don't die.
MAN: You'll meet them again. [SCREAMING]
MAN: Not yet.
No! They will clean it. Wait and see.
Don't die.
They'll feed you to the lions.
They are worth more than we are.
Better now?
Clean. You see?
MAN: Proximo! My old friend.
Every day is a great day when you are here.
Today... is your most fortunate day.
Those giraffes you sold me... they won't mate. What?
they won't mate. What? They just walk around eating and not mating.
They just walk around eating and not mating.
You sold me queer giraffes.
I want my money back.
Not a chance. Aaarggh!
I do special price for you.
On what?
Have you seen my new stock? Come and see them.
Do any of them fight? I've got a match coming up.
Some are good for fighting, others for dying.
You need both, I think.
Get up!
What's your trade?
I was a hunter.
Oh, no. I bought him from a salt mine in Carthage.
Sit down!
PROXIMO: Mark of the legion.
Deserter. MAN: Maybe so. But who cares?
He's a Spaniard. PROXIMO: I'll take six...
for 1,000. MAN: One thousand?
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000!
PROXIMO: These slaves are rotten.
It all adds to the flavor. No! No-no-no. Wait-wait.
It all adds to the flavor. No! No-no-no. Wait-wait. Wait! We can negotiate.
Wait! We can negotiate.
I'll give you 2,000... and four for the beasts.
That's 5,000 for an old friend.
Come on! How long does it take to get into my own house?
I am Proximo!
I shall be closer to you for the next few days,
which will be last of your miserable lives,
than that bitch of a mother that brought you screaming into this world!
that brought you screaming into this world!
I did not pay good money for you for your company!
I paid it so that I could profit from your death.
And as your mother was there at your beginning,
so I shall be there at your end.
And when you die, and die you shall,
your transition shall be to the sound of:
Gladiators, I salute you.
MAN 1: Red! MAN 2: Red.
[GRUNTING] Yellow!
Yellow.
Good.
Red. Red!
Spaniard!
PROXIMO: That's enough for the moment!
His time will come.
[SNICKERING] Next!
Spaniard, why don't you fight?
We all have to fight.
Is that the sign of your gods?
Will that not anger them?
The gods favor you.
Red is the gods' color.
You will need their help today.
Some of you are thinking you won't fight.
Some that you can't fight.
They all say that,
until they're out there.
Listen.
CROWD: Kill. Kill. Kill.
Thrust this into another man's flesh,
and then they will applaud and love you for that.
You--
You may begin to love them...
for that.
Ultimately, we're all dead men.
Sadly, we cannot choose how, but...
we can decide how we meet that end...
in order that we are remembered... as men.
as men.
MAN: On the left, draw your shields!
On the right, draw your swords!
CROWD: Kill. Kill.
Pair them up, red with yellow.
Next!
Next!
Go away! [ANGRY, INDISTINCT SHOUTING]
He enters Rome like a conquering hero.
But what has he conquered?
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.
I think he could do very well.
For Rome or for you?
GRACCHUS: Go to your mother, Lucius. It's what she'd like.
Lucius!
Mother!
Hail, Caesar.
Senators.
Rome greets her new emperor.
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome, Highness.
Thank you, Falco. And for the loyal subjects,
Thank you, Falco. And for the loyal subjects, I trust they weren't too expensive. Caesar.
I trust they weren't too expensive. Caesar. Gracchus.
All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.
There are many matters that require your attention.
MAN: To order, then! To order!
For your guidance, Caesar,
the Senate has prepared a series of protocols...
to begin addressing the many problems in the city.
Beginning with basic sanitation for the Greek quarter...
to combat the plague which is already springing up there.
So if Caesar-- Shh.
Don't you see, Gracchus?
That's the very problem, isn't it?
My father spent all his time at study...
At books and learning and philosophy.
He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate.
And all the while, the people have forgotten.
But the Senate is the People, sire.
Chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.
I doubt that many of the people eat so well as you do, Gracchus.
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.
I think I understand my own people.
Then, perhaps Caesar will be so good as to teach us...
out of his own extensive experience.
I call it love. [CHUCKLING]
I am their father. The people are my children.
And I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly--
Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?
No. But if you interrupt me again...
I assure you that you shall.
Senator, my brother is very tired.
Leave your list with me.
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.
My lady, as always,
My lady, as always, your lightest touch commands obedience.
Who are they to lecture me?
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.
What uses? All they do is talk.
It should be just... you and me...
It should be just... you and me... and Rome. Don't even think it!
and Rome. Don't even think it!
There's always been a Senate.
Rome has changed.
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.
Of course, but leave the people their--
Illusions.
Traditions.
My father's war against the barbarians--
He said it himself, it achieved nothing.
But the people loved him. The people always love victories.
Why?
They didn't see the battles.
What do they care about Germania? They care about the greatness of Rome.
The greatness of Rome.
Well, what is that?
It's an idea.
Greatness--
Greatness is a vision.
Exactly. A vision.
Do you not see, Lucilla?
I will give the people a vision of Rome, and they'll love me for it.
And they'll soon forget the tedious sermonizing
And they'll soon forget the tedious sermonizing of a few dry, old men.
I will give the people the greatest vision of their lives.
MAN: Vino, vino, vino! White and red wine for your drinking pleasure!
Vino, vino, vino! Red and white wine for your drinking pleasure!
Games.
One hundred and fifty days of games.
He's cleverer than I thought.
Oh, clever.
The whole of Rome would be laughing at him...
if they weren't so afraid of his Praetorians.
Fear and wonder-- A powerful combination.
You really think the people will be seduced by that?
I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob.
Conjure magic for them, and they'll be distracted.
Take away their freedom and still they'll roar.
The beating heart of Rome... is not the marble of the Senate.
It's the sand of the Colosseum.
He'll bring them death,
and they will love him for it.
CROWD: Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!
Spaniard. Spaniard.
Spaniard. Spaniard.
Spaniard. Spaniard.
Guard!
Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained?
Is this not why you are here?
MAN: Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!
CROWD [IN UNISON]: Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!
What do you want?
Girl?
Boy?
You sent for me? Yes, I did.
You're good, Spaniard, but you're not that good.
You could be magnificent.
I'm required to kill, so I kill.
That is enough.
That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.
[SQUEALS] The young emperor... has arranged a series of spectacles
to commemorate his father, Marcus Aurelius.
I find that amusing...
since it was Marcus Aurelius-- the wise, the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius
the wise, the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius --that closed us down.
So finally, after five years of scratching a living
in flea-infested villages,
we're finally going back to where we belong,
the Colosseum.
[INHALING] Oh, you should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.
Fifty thousand Romans...
watching every movement of your sword,
willing you to make that killer blow.
[WHISPERING] The silence before you strike...
and the noise afterwards,
it rises. It rises up like-- Like th-- Like a storm...
Like th-- Like a storm...
As if you were the thunder god himself.
You were a gladiator?
Yes, I was.
You won your freedom?
[IN NORMAL VOICE] A long time ago, the emperor...
presented me with a rudius.
presented me with a rudius. It's just a wooden sword.
It's just a wooden sword.
The symbol of your freedom. He--
He touched me on the shoulder, and I was free.
You knew Marcus Aurelius?
I did not say I knew him. I said he touched me on the shoulder once.
You asked me what I want.
I too want to stand in front of the emperor...
as you did.
Then, listen to me. Learn from me.
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.
I was the best because the crowd loved me.
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom.
I will win the crowd.
I will give them something they have never seen before.
So, Spaniard, we shall go to Rome together... and have bloody adventures.
And the great whore will suckle us until we are...
fat and happy and can suckle no more.
And then,
when enough men have died,
perhaps you will have your freedom.
Here. Use this.
It's somewhere out there--
My country, my home.
My wife is preparing food.
My daughters carry water from the river.
Will I ever see them again?
I think no.
Do you believe you'll see them again when you die?
I think so.
But then, I will die soon.
They will not die for many years.
I'll have to wait.
But you would... wait.
Of course.
You see, my wife... and my son...
are already waiting for me.
You'll meet them again.
But not yet.
Not yet. Unless--
Not yet. Unless-- Not yet.
Not yet.
MAN: Out!
Go, go. Out!
PROXIMO: Good to see you again, old friend.
[WHISPERING] Bring me fortune.
Have you ever seen anything like that before?
I didn't know men could build such things.
Win the crowd.
MAN: Get Inside! Move. Inside.
He sleeps so well because he's loved.
Come, brother. It's late.
I will make Rome the wonder of the ages.
That is what Gracchus and his friends don't understand.
All my desires are splitting my head to pieces.
Commodus, drink this tonic.
I think the time is almost right.
I could announce the dissolution of the Senate...
at the celebration to honor our father. You think I should?
Are the people ready?
I think you need your rest now.
Will you stay with me?
Still afraid of the dark, brother?
Still.
[CHUCKLING] Always.
Stay with me tonight?
You know I won't.
Then kiss me.
Sleep, brother.
MAN: Come on now. Get out of the way!
I want you. I want you. I want you so--
SOLDIER: All right, Let him pass!
[BETTORS CLAMORING] MAN: Sixty!
MAN: Five hundred!
The emperor wants battles, and I don't want to sacrifice my best fighters.
The crowd wants battles, so the emperor gives them battles.
And you get the battle of Carthage.
The massacre of Carthage.
Oh, why don't you go down to the prison and round up all the beggars and thieves.
We've done that.
We've done that. If you want to give away the best gladiators in the whole of the empire,
then I want double the rates.
You'll get your contract rates, or you'll get your contract canceled.
You don't like it?
Then you can crawl back down that shit-hole that you came from.
MAN: Cassius, please! Please, Cassius!
Gladiator, are you the one they call the Spaniard?
Yes.
They said you were a giant.
They said you could crush a man's skull with one hand. A man's? No.
A man's? No.
A boy's.
They have good horses in Spain? Some of the best.
This is Argento, and this is Scarto.
They were my horses.
They were taken from me.
I like you, Spaniard.
I shall cheer for you. They let you watch the games?
My uncle says it makes me strong.
And what does your father say?
My father's dead.
Master Lucius, it is time.
I have to go.
Your name is Lucius?
Lucius Verus, after my father.
MAN: Lower!
MAN: Claudius! MAN 2: Yes?
MAN: More shields!
HANDLER: When the emperor enters, raise your weapons, salute him,
raise your weapons, salute him, and then speak together!
Face the emperor and don't turn your back on him!
Go, and die with honor!
MAN: Hail, mighty Caesar!
CROWD: Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
CROWD: Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
[IN UNISON] And we who are about to die, salute you!
CASSIUS: On this day,
we reach back to hallowed antiquity...
to bring you a recreation of the second fall of mighty Carthage!
On the barren plain of Zarma,
there stood the invincible armies... of the barbarian, Hannibal.
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors from all brute nations
bent on merciless... destruction...conquest.
destruction...conquest.
Your emperor is pleased to give you
the barbarian horde!
Anyone here been in the army?
No. MAN: Yes.
I served with you at Vindobona.
You can help me.
Whatever comes out of these gates,
we've got a better chance of survival if we work together.
Do you understand?
If we stay together, we survive.
I'm pleased to bring you the legionnaires of Scipio Africanus!
To the death!
MAXIMUS: Stay close!
Come together!
Staggered columns!
Staggered columns!
MAN 1: Soon all your men will be slain. MAN 2: You don't have a chance!
MAXIMUS: Lock your shields! Stay as one!
Hold!
Hold!
As one! [IN UNISON] As one!
Well done!
Hold!
Diamond! Diamond!
Yes! [GASPS]
Hagen! [GROANS]
This column to the chariots! This column--
This column to the chariots! This column-- Stay with me! [GRUNTING]
MAXIMUS: Quickly!
Get out there! Hurry!
Maximus!
Single column! Single column!
GLADIATORS: Single column!
We win!
My history's a little hazy, Cassius,
but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage?
Uh, yes, sire.
Um, forgive me, sire.
COMMODUS: No, I rather enjoy surprises.
Who is he?
They call him the Spaniard, sire.
I think I'll meet him.
Yes, sire.
MAN: Hail to the barbarians!
MAN: Forward! Arms at ready!
Drop your weapons!
Gladiator, the emperor has asked for you.
I'm at the emperor's service.
Rise. Rise.
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard. I don't think there's ever been a gladiator to match you.
I don't think there's ever been a gladiator to match you.
As for this young man, he insists you are Hector reborn.
he insists you are Hector reborn. Or was it Hercules?
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself and tell us all your real name?
You do have a name?
My name is Gladiator.
How dare you show your back to me?
Slave!
You will remove your helmet and tell me your name.
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,
commander of the armies of the north, general of the Felix Legions,
loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius,
father to a murdered son,
husband to a murdered wife...
and I will have my vengeance...
in this life or the next.
Arms!
CROWD: Live! Live! Live!
Live! Live! Live! Live! Live! Live!
Guards, at rest!
GLADIATORS [IN UNISON]: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
Why is he still alive?
I don't know.
He shouldn't be alive.
It vexes me.
I'm terribly vexed.
I did what I had to do.
If Father had had his way, the empire would have been torn apart.
You do see that?
Yes.
What did you feel when you saw him?
I felt nothing.
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?
No more than I wounded him.
They lied to me in Germania.
They told me he was dead.
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.
If they don't respect me, how can they ever love me?
Then you must let the legions know...
their treachery will not go unpunished.
Poor sister, I wouldn't want to be your enemy.
What will you do?
This way!
Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.
I knew your brother would send assassins.
I didn't realize he would send his best.
Maximus, he doesn't know.
My family was burned and crucified while they were still alive.
I knew nothing-- Don't lie to me!
I wept for them.
As you wept for your father?
As you wept for your father?
As you wept for your father? I have been living in a prison of fear since that day.
To be unable to mourn your father for fear of your brother.
To live in terror every moment of every day
because your son is heir to the throne.
Oh, I have wept.
My son was innocent.
So is mine.
Must my son die too, before you will trust me?
What does it matter if I trust you or not?
The gods have spared you. Don't you understand?
Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the emperor of Rome.
The gods have spared me?
I am at their mercy, with the power only to amuse a mob!
That is power. The mob is Rome.
And while Commodus controls them, he controls everything.
Listen to me.
My brother has enemies, most of all in the Senate.
But while the people follow him,
no one would dare stand up to him until you.
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.
There are some politicians who have dedicated their lives to Rome.
One man above all.
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?
Do you not understand?
I may die in this cell tonight, or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!
What possible difference can I make?
This man wants what you want.
Then have him kill Commodus!
I knew a man once,
a noble man, a man of principle
who loved my father.
And my father loved him.
This man served Rome well.
That man is gone.
Your brother did his work well.
Let me help you.
Yes, you can help me.
Forget you ever knew me...
and never come here again.
Guard! The lady has finished with me.
Maximus, you commanded legions?
You had many victories?
Yes.
In Germania?
In many countries.
MAN: General.
You have a great name.
He must kill your name before he kills you.
Yes, at the far end.
Senator Gaius. Hello.
Senator Gracchus. Don't often see you
enjoying the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.
I don't pretend to be a man of the people, Senator.
But I do try to be a man for the people.
CROWD: Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
CASSIUS: People of Rome!
On the fourth day of Antioch,
we can celebrate the 64th day of the games.
And, in his majestic charity,
the Emperor has deigned this day to favor the people of Rome...
with an historical final match.
Returning to the Colosseum today... after five years in retirement, Caesar
after five years in retirement, Caesar is pleased to bring you the only undefeated champion
in Roman history,
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!
He knows too well how to manipulate the mob.
He knows too well how to manipulate the mob. Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Rome, Proximo.
Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Rome, Proximo. This is not it! This is not it!
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.
We mortals are but shadows and dust.
Shadows and dust, Maximus!
CASSIUS: Representing the training lyceum of Antonius Proximo,
Caesar is proud to give you... Aelius Maximus!
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
They embrace him like he's one of their own.
The mob is fickle, brother. He'll be forgotten in a month.
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
No, much sooner than that.
It's been arranged.
We who are about to die salute you.
MAN: We're with you, Maximus!
MAN: Come on, finish it!
No! Pull! Pull!
Yeah!
Loose! Loose! Loose! Loose!
Gut him! Kill him!
CROWD: Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!
MAN: Maximus! Maximus the Merciful!
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
MAN: Forward, guards! On battery!
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
What am I going to do with you?
You simply won't...
die.
Are we so different, you and I?
You take life when you have to... as I do.
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.
Then take it now.
They tell me your son...
squealed like a girl...
when they nailed him to the cross.
And your wife... moaned like a whore...
when they ravaged her...
again and again...
and again.
The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end,
Highness.
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
General! General!
General!
General! General! Get back!
General! Cicero!
Maximus! Maximus!
[CROWD CONTINUES CHANTING] CICERO: General!
General. Where are you camped?
General. Where are you camped? Ostia.
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
We love you, Maximus! Praise the victor!
Tell the men their general lives. Find me.
Move along! Find me!
Can they hear you?
Who? Your family, in the afterlife.
Oh, yes. What do you say to them?
To my boy,
I tell him I will see him again soon, to keep his heels down when he's riding his horse.
to keep his heels down when he's riding his horse.
To my wife--
That is not your business.
And now they love Maximus for his mercy.
So I can't just kill him, or it makes me even more unmerciful!
The whole thing's like some crazed nightmare.
FALCO: He is defying you.
FALCO: He is defying you. His every victory is an act of defiance.
The mob sees this, and so do the Senate.
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.
Kill him. No.
I will not make a martyr of him.
I have been told... of a certain sea snake...
which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey.
It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as if wounded.
Then its enemies will approach, and yet it will lie quite still.
And then its enemies will take little bites of it,
and yet it remains... still.
So...
we will lie still...
and let our enemies come to us and nibble.
Have every senator followed.
Maximus.
Cicero, my old friend. I thought perhaps I'd seen you for the last time.
I thought you were dead. Close.
How long have the men been in Ostia? All winter.
And how do they look?
Fattened and bored.
Who's in command?
Some fool from Rome.
How soon do you think they could be ready to fight? For you, tomorrow.
I need you to do something for me.
MAN: Come see. Witness.
If you haven't been in the arena, you can see the show here.
Giant Maximus is defeating our Emperor Commodus. What are we to do?
What are we to do? He's defying everyone by doing this...
He's defying everyone by doing this...
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, he got him! GUARD: Make way!
GUARD: Make way! Give way! Give way!
Give way! Give way!
MAN: Three casks of red wine...
My lady? I served your father at Vindobona.
GUARD: Back. CICERO: My lady.
I served your father at Vindobona.
Back! And I served the General Maximus.
Back! And I served the General Maximus. I serve him still.
Stop.
Stop. GUARD: Stop!
LUCILLA: Stand back.
The General sends word. He will meet your politician.
For your loyalty, soldier.
Thank you, my lady.
Up!
LUCILLA: Leave us.
Senator Gracchus.
General.
I hope my coming here today is evidence enough that...
I hope my coming here today is evidence enough that... you can trust me.
The Senate is with you? The Senate?
Yes. I can speak for them.
You can buy my freedom and smuggle me out of Rome?
To what end?
Get me outside the city walls.
Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia. My army's encamped there.
My army's encamped there.
By nightfall of the second day, I shall return at the head of 5,000 men.
But the legions all have new commanders... loyal to Commodus.
Let my men see me alive,
and you shall see where their loyalties lie.
This is madness.
No Roman army has entered the capital in a hundred years. Gracchus--
in a hundred years. Gracchus-- I will not trade one dictatorship for another!
The time for half-measures and talk is over, Senator.
And after your glorious coup, what then?
You'll take your 5,000 warriors and leave?
I will leave.
The soldiers will stay for your protection,
under the command of the Senate.
So once all of Rome is yours, you'll just give it back to the people?
Tell me why.
Because that was the last wish of a dying man.
I will kill Commodus.
The fate of Rome I leave to you.
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.
His daughter trusts you.
I will trust you.
But we have little time.
Give me two days...
and I will buy your freedom.
And you--
You stay alive.
Or I'll be dead.
Now we must go.
It won't work.
The Emperor knows too much.
And as for me,
it's becoming dangerous.
You will be paid on my return.
I give you my word. [CHUCKLES]
Your word? What if you don't return?
Do you remember what it was to have trust, Proximo?
Trust?
Who am I to trust?
I will kill Commodus.
Why would I want that?
He makes me rich.
Oh, I--
I know that you are a man of your word, General.
I know that you would die for honor.
You would die for Rome.
You would die for the memory of your ancestors.
But I, on the other hand...
...am an entertainer.
Hm? Guard!
He killed the man who set you free.
Praetorians, master.
Halt!
COMMODUS: Where have you been?
I sent for you.
Please, brother.
What's troubling you?
Does Gracchus have a new lover?
I don't know.
I thought you'd seen him.
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.
For the health of Rome, the Senate must be bled.
And he will bleed too...
very soon.
But not tonight.
Do you remember what our father said once?
"It's a dream...
a frightful dream...
life is."
Do you think that's true?
I don't know.
I think it is.
And I have only you to share it with.
Open your mouth.
You know I love you.
And I love you.
Out. Get out!
Move!
Congratulations, General.
You've got very... persuasive friends.
My brother's had Gracchus arrested.
We daren't wait any longer. You must leave tonight.
Proximo will come at midnight and take you to the gate.
Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there with horses.
You have done all this?
Yes. You risk too much.
I have much to pay for.
You have nothing to pay for.
You love your son. You're strong for him.
I am tired of being strong.
My brother hates all the world,
and you most of all.
Because your father chose me. No.
Because my father loved you.
And because I loved you.
A long time ago.
Was I very different then?
You laughed more.
I have felt alone all my life,
except with you.
I must go.
Yes.
LUCIUS: There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There.
There. There. And I've got you.
Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?
I'm not a legionnaire.
Not a legionnaire? I'm a gladiator.
A gladiator?
Gladiators only fight in the games.
Wouldn't you rather be a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?
a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!
The savior of Rome?
And who said that?
Where's Lucius?
He's with the Emperor, my lady.
LUCIUS: She couldn't. COMMODUS: Yes, she did.
She took it from a basket...
and pressed it to her breast, right here above her heart.
LUCIUS: It bit her in the breast?
Yes.
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies behave very strangely
and do very odd things in the name of love.
I think it's silly. So do I.
So do I.
Sister, join us.
I've been reading to dear Lucius.
LUCIUS: I've been reading too.
Yes. He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.
We've been reading about the great Mark Antony
and his adventures in Egypt.
The queen killed herself with a snake.
COMMODUS: And just wait until you hear what happened to our ancestors.
If you're very good,
tomorrow night I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.
He was betrayed...
by those closest to him.
By his own blood.
They whispered in dark corners... and went out late at night...
and conspired...
and conspired.
But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something.
He knew they were busy little bees.
And one night he sat down with one of them...
and he looked at her...
and he said,
"Tell me what you've been doing, busy little bee,
or I shall strike down those dearest to you.
You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."
And the Emperor was heartbroken.
The little bee had wounded him more deeply than anyone else could ever have done.
And what do you think happened then, Lucius?
I don't know, Uncle.
The little bee told him everything.
MAN: Open, in the name of the Emperor!
Proximo!
Open the gates in the name of the Emperor!
Proximo! [GATES RATTLING]
Open the gates!
Open the gates, Proximo!
Do you want to die, old man?
Here.
Everything is prepared.
Everything is prepared. It seems you've won your freedom. Proximo,
It seems you've won your freedom. Proximo,
are you in danger of becoming a good man?
Juba? All enemies of the Emperor, die!
Open the gates! The Emperor commands!
Pull!
Move! Two columns on the left!
I only need moments, so do not be careless with your lives.
If you don't want any part of this,
If you don't want any part of this, go back to your cells.
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.
ALL: Strength and honor.
Go!
Strength and honor.
Aim! Break the bars!
Shadows and dust.
Maximus!
[GAGGING] I'm sorry.
[GRUNTS] No!
It's done.
And what of my nephew?
And what of his mother?
Should they share her lover's fate?
Or should I be merciful?
Commodus the Merciful.
Lucius will stay with me now.
And if his mother...
so much as looks at me... in a manner that displeases me...
he will die.
If she decides... to be noble...
and takes her own life...
he will die.
And as for you,
you will love me...
as I loved you.
You will provide me with an heir... of pure blood...
so that Commodus and his progeny... will rule for a thousand years.
Am I not merciful?
[SHOUTING] Am I not merciful?
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus.
Maximus.
Maximus.
They call for you.
The general who became a slave.
The slave who became a gladiator.
The gladiator who defied an emperor.
A striking story.
Now the people want to know how the story ends.
Only a famous death will do.
And what could be more glorious...
than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena?
You would fight me?
Why not?
Do you think I'm afraid?
I think you have been afraid all your life.
Unlike Maximus the Invincible, who knows no fear?
I knew a man who once said, "Death smiles at us all.
All a man can do is smile back."
I wonder.
Did your friend smile at his own death?
You must know.
He was your father.
You loved my father, I know.
But so did I.
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?
Smile for me now, brother.
Strap on his armor.
Conceal the wound.
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
SOLDIER: Ring formation!
Ring formation!
MAN: Off with his head, Maximus!

Quintus, sword!

Sword! Give me a sword!
Sheathe your swords!
QUINTUS: Sheathe your swords!
QUINTUS: Maximus.
Maximus.
Quintus.
Free my men.
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.
There was a dream that was Rome.
It shall be realized.
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.
Free the prisoners! Go!
Maximus.
Lucius is safe.
[SIGHING] Go to them.
You're home.
Is Rome worth one good man's life?
We believed it once.
Make us believe it again.
He was a soldier of Rome.
Honor him.
Who will help me carry him?
Now we are free.
I will see you again.
She said it.
She did.
MAN: (ON RADIO) ...with some precipitation in the Central Valley.
Reno area, a little milder. Looking like a low predicted at 37 degrees
and a high at 42.
The low-pressure systems continue in the mountains of the Sierras.
We've got some snow flurries at times down to about 5,000 feet.
And we are gonna see some hazy sunshine in the morning.
Go, Mick, go.
Yeah, okay.
(SHUTTER CLOSING)
Good morning. Jerry.
There you are. Morning.
Oh, I've gotta plug that fridge back in. l thought it was going with you.

Congratulations, Jerry.
No parking on this street. You saw that?
Come on now, Jerry! Hey, Larry. You outlasted me. (CHUCKLES)

But you did, and uh...
Hits me deep.
Thank you.
POLLACK: l'm going back to the station. Get Becker County on the phone.
You guys should go on up. KROLAK: It's gonna be dark by the time we get up there...
Thanks.
What's up?
Juvenile homicide. Becker County.
Possible sexual assault. Little girl.
Upper lakes? Why isn't the local handling it?
Our hard-core crime unit assists that jurisdiction now.
Jerry, for Christ sake, you're retiring.
l still got six more hours.
As far as l'm concerned, you're gone. lt's Krolak's case.
He's in charge, his call. lt's fine with me.
KROLAK: If you want to leave your own party. My coat's upstairs.
REPORTER: Good evening, this is Elena Ryan and I'm just outside of Reno,
and in behind you have the crime scene
where the body of a young girl has just been found.
And we have emergency vehicles coming in and out of here. (POLICE SIREN WAILING)
We have state troopers, we have Reno police.
(SIRENS WAILING) STROM: Bruising and lacerations evident on the interior of both thighs.
Bruising and possible wrist fractures due to restraints.
Neck slashed.
KROLAK: Did you get her age in there?
SHERIFF: She, uh... She was a second-grader. l guess that'd put her about seven and a half, eight.
Coupled with initial signs of lividity, all indications
Coupled with initial signs of lividity, all indications are the victim's body was not moved from initial place of death.
SHERIFF: We checked the entire perimeter.
Even with the snow, this path's the only way in or out.
So what the fuck are you doing standing on it? Oh, l'm sorry.
STROM: ...and other weather-related contamination.
Whose fucking pen is this? STROM: Lashes on both...
Oh, Jesus, that's... lt's mine. Pardon me.
Any sign of a weapon?
Any sign of a weapon? SHERIFF: No, but, l mean, a knife like that, you could chuck it pretty far.
Assuming it was a knife. KROLAK: How long before you can wrap this up?
Couple more minutes.
Couple more minutes. Okay, I'm gonna let the Coroner know he can pick her up. (SNIFFS)
The buttons.
Have the lab guys check for prints on the buttons.
On both the coat and the dress.
Goddamn it.
(SNIFFS) Strom, be sure and secure all the buttons for lab work
before you move her out.
Hey, guys, get the buttons... KROLAK: Let's go, big guy.
What about the little girl's parents?
Duane and Margaret Larsen.
They got a turkey farm about 10 miles from here.
Good people. You can go ahead and pick her up now!
KROLAK: Have you interviewed them? SHERIFF: No.
Uh, we haven't told them yet.
None of us knew what to say.
(SIGHS) Jesus Christ.
KROLAK: Nobody told the little girl's parents.
KROLAK: ls this the little boy right here? SHERIFF 1: Yeah.
Evening, son.
Chilly out here, isn't it?
Why don't you take him back to your station. l'll talk to him there.
Right. Anything on the suspect or his truck?
Hang on.
Highway Patrol got anything?
SHERIFF 2: Todd said he put it out there.
lt's out statewide, and l got highway patrol on it.
Congratulations.
Now, who's gonna tell the parents?
Does anybody here know them?
l got one of my deputies, but he'd rather not.
He'd rather not.
Most Wednesdays, Ginny stays in town.
For music lessons with my mother.
But when she's behind on her homework,
(SOBBING) she comes straight home.
So her grandmother would've assumed that she came home?
We always let Ginny...
Yes.
(DOOR OPENS) Excuse me, um,
Pastor Holcomb's on his way over. JERRY: Thank you.
Would you mind not smoking in the house, please?
Sorry.
(SOBS) It isn't possible.
There can't be such a devil.
There are such devils.
l want to see my daughter.
l don't think that's a good idea, Mr. Larsen, uh...
(SIGHING) l know what l'm saying might sound cruel but...
l think it's better if you don't go to your Ginny now.
Why would it be better for me not to see my daughter?
Why would that be better?
Because we hardly dared to look ourselves.
You can go to your Ginny tomorrow evening.
Then there won't be anything that's, um...
MARGARET: What? JERRY: She'll look just like she fell asleep. Believe me.
Who did this?
We intend to find out, Mrs. Larsen.
Do you promise me that you will?
Yes.
Yes, Mrs. Larsen, l promise.
By your soul's salvation?
Do you swear...
By your soul's salvation on this cross,
made by the hands of our daughter?
Yes.
Yes, on my soul's salvation.
(WHISPERING) You've sworn by your salvation.
We will pray.
DEPUTY: Detective!
Detective Black?
Looks like they got him.
Highway Patrol picked up a match on the truck with an Indian driver.
KROLAK: l gave you a new headband, Toby. l know you lost yours.
KROLAK: Toby, l can't see your eyes, buddy.
You'll like this.
Let's see it.
KROLAK: Ah, Toby, you've already served time for one charge of juvenile rape now.
Statutory. The girl was 16 years old.
KROLAK: Toby, would you tell him that rape is rape?
You got three years of juvenile, you got some burglary.
You got some theft, grand theft.
KROLAK: The man likes his marijuana. Multiple counts of marijuana possession, Toby, and then that first rape.
Section Four. Man's got a mental handicap, Stan.
KROLAK: No.
Well, number one, that might not take the violence out of you.
Number two, l'm gonna get a confession.
And number three, l'm gonna do it in record time.
How you doing, chief?
Scared of this thing? Let's get it out of the way then.
KROLAK: Who you talking to, chief?
(MURMURS INDISTINCTLY) You got those little voices in your head?
You a policeman? Yeah, l'm a policeman.
l want to be a policeman too. You do, huh?
Policeman drive me here very fast. Drive me fast.
l'm just a trapper. We don't need this.
l trap beaver today.
Fifteen pounds or 25,
or 35, something like that. Maybe 80.
You mean beaver or you mean "beaver"?
Beaver. Beaver? Pretty, young pussy?
l don't know you joking me. You don't know if I'm jokin'?
l don't know.
No, l'm not joking you. So you catch beaver, huh?
Yeah, l...
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Yeah, l catch beaver. You catch beaver? Little girl?
You catch little girl today, huh? You rape little girl?
ls that what you did?
l rape, l rape.
You raped her, huh?
Yeah. KROLAK: Yeah.
He could be talking about the other rape, the one on his record.
We got a positive ID from the kid.
This is a small town. Just let him do his job.
KROLAK: Tell me about that little girl.
You rape a little girl today?
lt's okay.
You can tell me.
You killed her.
Didn't you, Toby? Hmm?
lt's all right. lt's okay, bud. Huh?
Something simply came over you today, didn't it?
All at once you became like an animal?
You attacked and you raped her.
You raped that little girl.
Then, Toby, you know, without wanting to...
You know, but sometimes you can't stop yourself, you know?
And you murdered her, didn't you?
Huh? That hurts right there, doesn't it?
Yeah? You like that, huh? (CHUCKLES)
You like that? Huh?
Toby, maybe you just wanted her to be quiet.
Huh? You just wanted her to stop screaming at you.
Something was stronger than you, Toby.
Then, when you came to yourself...
You were horrified.
Then you saw that little girl...
And you ran.
l ran. l ran, l ran. Yeah, you ran.
Yeah. l ran. lt's all right.
lt's all right, Toby.
l ran. You ran.
Yeah. lt's all right.
You want to cry?
Come here. Come here.
lt's all right. Come on.
(GRUNTS AND PANTS) Toby, you've gotta stand up for what you did, okay?
You gotta stand up.
You gotta stand up. He don't know what the heck Stan's talkin' about. Stand up and confess. Okay?
(WHISPERING) lt's all right.
I... I killed her.
You killed her?
l killed her. You killed her?
Yeah.
KROLAK: Say it. TOBY: I killed a little girl.
Say it I... I killed a little girl.
You killed that little girl? Yeah, I killed that little girl.
You killed that little girl? Yeah, yeah.
Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Say it. Just put your head up to heaven and say it, Toby.
What did you say? Say it! (GRUNTS)
Say it, Toby! (PANTS AND SOBS)
Yeah, you killed her, didn't you, Toby?
KROLAK: Yeah, it's okay. TOBY: I remember, I kill, I...
Toby, Toby, it's okay. l got you. l got you.
l got you. (SOBBING)
He practically blew him. (CHUCKLES)
Coroner just called.
They found chocolate in the little girl's stomach.
We got wrappers all over the cab of the Indian's truck.
KROLAK: Deputy! (SIGHS)
There you go.
Come on, Toby. Goddamn it!
Come on, walk like a policeman, Toby. You're a policeman now. (TOBY GROANS)
Okay to use this phone?
SHERIFF: Yeah, go ahead. Christ!
You fish the lakes up here, l'm told? Yeah.
SHERIFF: Anglers haven't been doing much. Watch your step.
But spear houses have been hitting pretty heavy. It could be the snow cover.
Could be that.
What about the noise... (GUN FIRES)
DEPUTY: He's got my gun! He's got my gun! (TOBY GRUNTS AND GROANS)
KROLAK: Tell me when, Jerry. DEPUTY: Drop it! Drop it! (TOBY GRUNTS AND GROANS)
COP 1: He's got Hamilton! DEPUTY: Let go!
JERRY: Freeze! Put it down, Toby! (GRUNTS) (SCREAMS)
No! (SCREAMS)
Don't shoot me! Please don't shoot me! Don't shoot me!
Toby, put it down! l kill little girl!
JERRY: No goddamn it. No!
Oh, God. ls everyone okay?
JERRY: Get a roll call! Fitz!
COP 2: l'm on it.
JERRY: Fitz! SHERIFF: Hamilton! Michael!
Are you hit?
l don't think so. Oh, Jesus.
All right. Oh, Mike, you all right?
Oh, my God.
Jesus Christ. You all right?
SHERIFF: Get an ambulance. Do it. COP 1: Right.
l thought he was gonna kill me. You're all right. You're okay.
KROLAK: What's that, the bullet?
His tooth.
(WOMAN ANNOUNCING OVER PA) (AIRPLANE PASSING BY)
Gate 42. And they'll be boarding in about a half an hour.
ls that Concourse E? Yes, it is, sir.
Thank you very much. You're welcome.
Next in line, please.
Hi, how are you folks today?
Thank you. Going to Cabo San Lucas today.
Wadenah had been previously convicted of similar crimes, a repeat offender, still on parole.
Regarding the alleged suicide of the suspect while in custody,
state's attorney Paul Ross has organized an investigative committee
to look into the tactics of the Becker County Sheriff's Office. Now we turn to John Qulgley in Becker County. John?
You okay?
Hmm. Yes, thank you.
Sheriff's Department investigators worked in concert
with Reno homicide detectives for several hours,
piecing together the evidence trail that led to the brisk apprehension of Wadenah.
Authorities here, while understandably disturbed
by the brief hostage-taking of one of their deputies,
are taking some comfort
in the swift justice of this very dramatic evening. (AIRPLANE PASSING BY) (SLOT MACHINE WHIRRING AND DINGS)
(SIRENS WAILING) Yet, while an investigation is underway, the consensus seems clear.
Wadenah confessed after being identified by the young snowmobiler.
His suicide brought a brutal end...
WOMAN: (ON PA) Final boarding call, Northwest flight 1607 to Cabo San Lucas.
STORE CLERK: Customer, Oliver!
Morning. Morning.
Nice day today. Can we help you with anything? Anything in particular?
Well, actually, probably there is.
l'm looking for a person. Annalise, or Anna-Lisa Hansen.
Yes. She would live above the electric store.
That would be a small unit. lt's two doors down to your left.
Okay? And if l were you, I'd go around the corner and take the stairs up.
You shouldn't have any trouble finding her.
And if you don't, come back.
Thank you very much. l appreciate your help.
You're welcome.
ANNALISE: So, what is it that you need to know?
(SIGHS) Well, l'm trying to fill in the gaps, uh...
Fit all the pieces together, Mrs. Hansen.
(INHALES) lf you could remember anything
from when you were interviewed, uh...
Anything in particular that might, um...
It was Wednesday and she never came.
They said that she never got on the bus,
never even made it to the school.
Now, l assumed that she'd gone home.
And, uh, wh... What was she like, uh...
What were your Wednesdays with Ginny...
What were they like?
Oh, she would come in with her little knapsack
and plop it on the floor.
Give me a kiss on my cheek.
Big kiss, always my left cheek.
And then, it was time for work.
The moment she would sit at the piano,
we were all business.
And l would give her
her lesson just the same as all my other pupils.
And it was no "Grandma" this or "Grandma" that.
But the moment we were done,
she was my Ginny again.
How could God be so greedy?
Ma'am, l...
And after the lesson?
Cookies.
We would have cookies, if I'd baked them.
Or sometimes l would send her down to the Land of Christmas.
The store downstairs, for candy or ice cream.
She would eat her sweets and l would read to her.
She loved Andersen.
Who?
Do you know what he wrote in his story The Angel?
No. (CHUCKLES)
Here.
"Whenever a good child dies,
"an angel of God
"comes down from heaven
"and takes the child in his arms.
"And spreads out his great white wings.
"And flies with her
"over all the places
"that she loved during her life.
"And then, the child carries
"a large handful of flowers
"up to God."
Beautiful.
JERRY: What's your name?
Becky. Becky Fiske.
And you were Ginny's best friend?
We sat together.
She died.
Yeah. l know.
Her grandmother told me that Ginny liked to tell stories.
Sometimes.
What kind of stories?
Ginny knew a giant.
Giant?
Really?
He was as big as a mountain and gave her porcupines.
She called him "The Wizard."
Ginny made a picture of him.
Ginny drew a picture of a giant?
Can l see it?
lt's on the wall in the hallway.
We put Ginny's picture.
l gotta go.
Jean, hold my calls.
I thought you were supposed to be fishing in Mexico.
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT) I know, Stan.
l went to the airport.
l heard the boarding announcement.
And I... I just didn't feel right.
Something went off. l need more time on this.
You want me to reopen a case because you got a hunch?
(MOUTHING) Yeah. Jerry, no offense, but you're retired. You don't work here anymore.
Okay.
l know, Stan.
l know. But could you run it through the system for me anyway?
You know, just a standard query.
Similar crimes, profile, victims.
Could you?
Say, for...
The last 10, 12 years.
Could you, Stan?
Please?
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
MAN: This is eight years ago when this happened. (GROANS)
I'm on the job only six months at the point when this very big deal goes down.
Talk about baptism by fire.
And to top off everything else,
it was in the summer season.
"Politics of tourism" and all that nonsense.
So we all feel the pressure to make the bogeyman of it all disappear.
The brass were pretty clear in the presumption
that it was one of those festival-goers.
Which seemed like, you know, a pretty good bet.
Not to mention, a good way to diffuse the kind of panic that people get. You know, when they feel like there's a bogeyman amongst them.
You know, when they feel like there's a bogeyman amongst them.
(GROANS) So we all figured,
and l do feel accurately, that's why we never did catch him.
The odds were on a perpetrator
who'd cleared the county before the body was ever found.
Yeah.
Look at the slit in that neck.
I don't know, but for me... For me, it's like being in a movie.
For me, it's like being in a movie.
This stuff just doesn't bother me like it does some people. You?
Luanne Rotze.
A little 10-year-old girl.
Real little. l mean, real small for her age.
You know what, though?
As horrible as that kind of thing is,
l got an adrenaline rush being part of it.
I don't know if that's bad, but, hey, don't hurt me.
That's just the way it hit me.
Nothing like it ever happened before in that area.
By the way, nothing like it ever happened since.
And l think that says a lot.
You mind if l keep this one? I couldn't let you do that.
We always like to be of help, but
strictly technically, the case is still open.
Well, then how about the report?
I'll make you a copy. How's that?
Sure would appreciate it.
But keep it between us.
I'm not sure what the policy is on this kind of thing. Okay?
My lips are sealed.
Lucy!
A two-year-old horse is like a woman. You can't predict what they're gonna do.
They're crazy.
Excuse me. Sir?
Sir?
Sir? I wonder if you could tell me where a man named James Olstad might be?
Olstad's not a patient here.
Oh. Well, l believe he's the custodian, sir.
Maybe in the building, mopping? But he's not a patient here.
Mopping in the building? Yeah, but not a patient here.
James Olstad?
I'm Jerry Black. I'm a police detective.
I'd just like to talk to you about your daughter.
What daughter?
You did have a daughter that went missing three years ago, didn't you?
Did you come here to tell me that, uh, something happened to her?
No, sir. lt was...
Did you find her dead or something?
No. No, sir. We're, uh...
We're still trying to find her.
Anything you might tell me about her?
Could you describe her?
She must be...
She must be different now.
She was so pretty.
I miss her so much!
We just used to, like, hold each other.
I was supposed to take care of her.
She was my little girl, you know? (SNIFFLES)
I just...
Where is my little girl?
Where is my baby?
The break is Monash County. Eight years ago, we got a homicide.
Same MO.
Exact same victim profile description as the Ginny Larsen case.
I interviewed one of the local officers for the particulars.
Little blonde girl, 10 years old, sexual assault, throat slit.
The photos show that she was wearing a red dress.
Detectives out at Morehead covered this case. The case is still open.
At the time of the murders,
Toby Wadenah was in Stillwater Penitentiary,
doing time on his own rape conviction.
So, he couldn't have done it. Jerry, the man shot himself.
Jerry, the man shot himself. What more do you want? You told him what he did and he believed you.
What more do you want? You told him what he did and he believed you. All right, let's just calm down here a minute and see what Jerry's got. You got something, Jerry?
And there's more. More.
Here. See here?
This is the Larsen murder. This is the Monash County girl. And here...
Here, you see this pattern?
Three years ago, l got a girl gone missing, Cathy Olstad.
Same exact description, a little blonde girl, nine years old,
last seen wearing a red dress.
And?
And?
Don't you see?
I see you've given a description that could fit any number of juvenile murders.
And a victim profile that matches every other little girl in the state, just about,
give or take the red dress.
I mean, why didn't you mention that her eyes were blue while you were at it? Come on, Jerry!
I mean, whatever made you think
that the Larsen girl wasn't murdered by Wadenah?
This did.
This convinced me.
Ginny's drawing of the Porcupine Giant.
I have reason to believe, based on my conversations and interviews,
that Ginny Larsen made this drawing just days before she was murdered.
I have reason to believe that she was meeting with this man,
seen here as a giant, all dressed in black, on a regular basis.
This is not an lndian. This is not an lndian type.
And you see this car here? This big, black car?
This is not a truck.
This is not a maroon truck like Wadenah drove.
This is a big, black station wagon.
And these right here, these, according to an interview l had
with a girl named Beck... (STAMMERS) Betsy Fiske, these are porcupines.
Betsy Fiske, these are porcupines. Okay. Whoa! Hold it.
Porcupines and giants and...
You got to get ahold of yourself, Jerry.
The case is closed.
I made a promise.
I made a promise to find
Ginny Larsen's murderer.
I intend to keep it.
Listen, Jerry.
You gotta start getting on with your life, you know?
I mean, sometimes when you go through big changes,
and retirement's definitely one of them,
it can cause a lot of added stress.
Sometimes it's a good idea just to
talk to someone. You know, someone
professional.
I made a promise, Eric.
You're old enough to remember when that meant something.
(SIGHS) Get a life.
WOMAN: Jerry, got your fresh towels here!
Most folks don't need them every day.
But I'd appreciate it if you'd not get them so dirty that they're not to be white again.
Here's your nice little sunroom. You can smoke in here.
This is the living room area. No partying, please, no.
Kitchen, of course. All the amenities of home.
Bedroom. We just put a new mattress on there. So it should be really comfy.
And, oh, yeah, trash goes in the covered dumpster.
And fish guts you gotta wrap and place in the covered pail next to the cleaning station.
Rules and regulations of Sugar Bush up here. Yep.
And no nude sunbathing.
So, l'll leave these here and I'll get Rose to come make up your bed.
If there's anything else you'll be needing, just let me know. Okeydokey?
Good morning.
I'll have a pack of lights.
That the owner?
My daddy.
What can l do for you?
Well, l was just having a look around.
How long you had this place?
Oh, 30 years.
Ever think about selling it?
No.
Well, uh, gee. What would it take to get you to think about selling?
(CLEARS THROAT) lt's not for sale. (CHUCKLES)
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you my number over where l'm staying.
At Thompson's Sugar Bush Resort.
I don't mean to be pushy, but...
If you'd think about it...
I'll wait to hear from you over at Thompson's, if it's all right.
Been a pleasure. Thanks for coming in.
Nice place.
RESORT OWNER: You didn't tell me you were a cop!
Ex-cop. Ha! Once a cop...
I'm retired.
Uh, what l wanted to tell you was that Floyd Cage called.
The fellow with the gas station. He says he wants to talk to you.
Oh. l see they're biting.
You bet. Sure does look like it.
You can use the phone up in the front cabin here.
Thank you.
Well, Floyd, Jerry signed all the papers. You're ready to go.
Well, l sure appreciate it. You've done a good job.
Good luck.
When we get a number down in Arizona, we'll give you a call, leave you our number.
I'm going to Arizona!
So if you forget something or want to know where something is,
So if you forget something or want to know where something is, or whatever...
Good luck to you. JERRY: Thank you.
WOMAN: Sure hope you're gonna be happy here.
'Cause you're never gonna be able to sell this place for what you paid for it.
Well, thank you, I'll do my best.
DRIVER: Hey, is this working or what?
I just have to get a key. I'll be right with you. Thank you.
LORI: Be right with you. JERRY: Thank you.
LORI: What can l get you?
Just a beer, thanks.
You're the city cop that bought the service station?
I'm retired from the police department.
And you bought Floyd's station?
l did.
That's a strange thing to do. You must be an angler.
How'd you guess? (LAUGHS) Nothing else to do around here.
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
These only work about half the time.
All right, just sign right there for me, if you would.
JERRY: That's for you.
Thank you and...
Here's your receipt. Thank you, sir. Have a good day.
All right, 10 regular.
Nice wagon. Sticks out around here though, doesn't it?
Never thought about it being different. (CHUCKLING)
Just know I always get them black, so they don't show the dirt as much.
Ten it is. Well, thanks for stopping by. (ENGINE STARTING)
ANNALISE: " Whenever a good child dies,
"an angel of God comes down from heaven
"and takes the dead child in his arms.
"And spreads out his great white wings.
"And flies with her
"over all the places that she loved in her life."
DOCTOR: And what do you feel is represented here?
Well, the porcupine giant. Ginny told her friends at school
that she was meeting with a giant in the forest
and that he gave her little porcupines.
What do you mean? You see these... Hmm?
What do you mean by "porcupines"?
l don't know exactly.
Those are the words of a 7-year-old girl.
Ginny's friends. Friend, sorry.
And this is in the imagination of a 7-year-old girl. Correct?
you could be right. But...
On the other hand, the car is very well depicted,
and the giant is... Giants are imaginary.
Yes? (CLEARING THROAT)
a tall, heavyset man could appear
to be a giant to a little girl.
And the Indian man, was he a tall man?
not a giant, but tall, yes.
Why did you bring this to me, Mr. Black?
Sorry?
Why did you bring this to me, Mr. Black?
I need to know who I'm looking for.
I'm like a layman looking at an X-ray.
l don't know how to read it. l need help interpreting it.
This drawing can tell you nothing about
the murderer. All that drawing can do is tell you about the child who drew it.
Without more information, l don't think l can be of any value to you.
Humor me, Doc.
Consider this a working hypothesis and assume for the moment
that this is a drawing of the murderer.
Well,
your giant certainly looks tall, massive,
very imposing.
If this really does depict the relationship between the giant and the little girl,
then these things you call porcupines would appear to be gifts
then these things you call porcupines would appear to be gifts that the little girl is accepting.
That's implying a trust.
Was the girl in Monash County killed the same way?
Exactly the same.
Do the victims resemble one another?
Yes, a lot.
And what did you say the time intervals were between the murders?
The Monash County case was eight years ago.
The little girl missing, three,
and Ginny was just... Just last winter.
So the intervals are getting shorter.
lf that's the case, then yes, you could...
Remember, this is a hypothetical case.
Mmm-hmm. But yes, you could expect another incident within...
A matter of months.
Maybe a year, if the opportunity arose.
But this could just as well be the product
of a 7-year-old child's imagination.
Right.
You came to me for help.
Yes. Do you mind if l ask you some questions?
Shoot.
You recently retired, right?
Yes.
Have you always been a chain smoker?
MARGARET: Impossible. There can't be such a devil.
You always been a chain smoker? JERRY: Yes, there are such devils.
Recent. Recent.
MARGARET: Do you swear... Are you still sexually active?
MARGARET: By your soul's salvation...
Are you still sexually active?
Are you still sexually active?
JERRY: Yes, on my soul's salvation. Does that embarrass you?
Have you experienced any...
Have you experienced any sudden fevers, perspiration?
No. POLLACK: Got to get ahold of yourself, Jerry.
Or voices. Do you hear voices?
TOBY: I kill the girl. I kill the girl. KROLAK: No, goddamn it! No!
MAN: (ON TV) Lucky West's prescription has always been that with the predatory fish,
your best bet's live bait.
Here you see Kwan Lee, who's gone from worms
to the little fishies.
Where are those pancakes?
LORI: Don't forget your orange juice, baby. MAN 1: Can l get a touchup, please?
Thanks, doll. MAN 2: l could use a little fresh-up too.
Boy. Nice picture.
Thank you.
Aren't you gonna finish your orange juice?
Mommy.
Oh, hi, Officer. It's okay, honey, he's a friend.
Pack up, 'cause the bus is coming. Any coffee?
Yes, please.
And what name would a pretty little girl like you have?
Chrissy.
(BUS HONKING) That's a nice name.
Okay, love bug, this is it. Come on, let's go.
Bye. Can l have a hug?
Have a good day.
Beautiful little girl. Oh, thank you.
JERRY: How old is she?
She'll be eight next month. First day of school's always a biggie.
Oh, l forgot your coffee. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
There you go. Oh, thank you.
Want some breakfast? Yeah.
I'd like bacon and eggs and...
How do you like your eggs? Over easy. And rye toast.
Okay. l got a question for you.
Fire away.
Where would an old bachelor like me find some used furniture?
Nothing too fancy, you know. A couch, dinette set.
Something between the not-too-expensive and poverty-stricken range.
My range. Um... (CHUCKLES)
There's a flea market up...
You go right up this road, Old Pass Road. Go north about 20, 25 miles up here.
And you're gonna hit a T-junction.
And once you get past a T-junction, it's gonna fork into two roads, two dirt roads.
There's no sign or anything that locals... Do you like shopping?
Mommy, can l have a balloon? Yeah.
What color do you want? Here, here, l got it.
Orange.
Orange. There you go. Well, you got pink.
That's okay. Pink? l like pink, too.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
l'm looking for Formica here.
lt wipes easy. That won't be a problem.
Ah, well, uh, what about this one right here? WOMAN: I think this gives a room a very warm feeling.
Now, this one's oak veneer. Veneer, huh? WOMAN: Yeah.
I can take five dollars off the top. JERRY: And what would that bring the total to?
Where's Chrissy?
Chrissy?
Where is she? She, she was just right here. Chrissy!
I'll get back to you.
Chrissy!
Chrissy!
She's on the swing.
Bye. LORI: Chrissy!
(SIGHS) Don't leave me like that. Mommy, that girl gave this to me.
lsn't it cute?
What is it?
WOMAN: It's a boot cleaner in the shape of a porcupine. lt's made by one of our local craft artists.
She makes doormats, too. Here, you want to come see?
HELEN: Fifteen apiece for the little fellows, 25 for the big. (WHIRRING)
The mats are 10 bucks even.
You don't run this whole place yourself, do you?
Are you a religious man, Mr. Black?
Um, baptized. But l'm not churchgoing.
You got a wife?
Two-time loser. What about you, ma'am?
My son, Gary, is the true gift of the Lord.
He dotes on me hand and foot, he does!
The hardest working boy you ever saw.
Works construction all summer.
Runs a snowplow for the county in the winter.
And ministers at our church.
Hmm. And, uh... What about him? Does he have a family, uh... Kids?
HELEN: No wife, no kids. No little ones.
I pray every day
he'll find a woman good enough for him.
The Lord hasn't come through yet.
God bless.
Closed!
l'm closed!
Yeah, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
Closed.
Lori?
Woman, what has happened to you? Come in. (SOBBING) So... Sorry.
(SOBBING) So... Sorry.
My ex... And I was just so scared. He was gonna kill me!
lt's all right. lt's all right. Shh. Shh.
(SOBBING) And you being a cop... Where's Chrissy? She's in the car.
Where's Chrissy? She's in the car. No, no, l got it. l got it.
Oh, no, no, no. But she's okay. It's all right, I'll take care of her. He didn't touch her. No. No. He didn't touch her.
LORI: With a restraining order, he's still gonna beat me up. JERRY: Mmm-hmm.
LORI: And then they put him in jail for it. He won't be able to pay child support payments. JERRY: All right.
That's why he's beatin' me up to begin with.
Ow. (INHALES) Uh-huh.
(SHUSHING) Just hold still. Uh-huh.
All right, this might...
All right, that's okay now.
Just hold still for a minute. (GASPING) All right. 'Cause this one might sting a little bit. Okay?
(PANTS) Yeah. All right. Just hold still. All right.
(GASPS) Right here, that's it. All right, hold still, that's it. Oh.
That's it. All right, all right, okay. (SIGHS) All right.
Yeah. (MOANS)
Yeah. Well, your eye looks okay.
(MUMBLES) I'm not sure you might not want to think about getting a stitch in that lip.
(SIGHS) I'm gonna miss that, uh, half-tooth of yours.
I'll drink out of this side for a while, anyway.
Listen, uh... Lori,
all things considered,
l think it might be best if you and your girl
stayed out here with me for a while.
That's not why I came here. Just hear me out.

This guy is real, and l know it.

Papa! Aye, aye, Pippi!
Why do we want all these necklaces and stuff?
Gifts for the Kurrekurre islanders, of course.
And I suppose these are to buy me a dress fit for a queen!
[ Laughing ] There you're wrong, me little darlin'.
They're to keep you out of the pot.
Little girl stew is a delicacy if they're still cannibals like the good old days.
Papa... save me!
[ Laughing ] I'll show you!
Right! Onto Alfonso!
Are we gonna take Alfonso ashore, Papa?
Of course. Aren't I the "Terror of the South Seas"?
We'll ride ashore in style. Maybe they'll think I'm King Neptune.
King Neptune? Never heard of him.
It's time you went back to school. Oh!
Fridolf. Yes, sir?
Take five and learn the princess some history stuff...
that'll come in handy when she's a boss like me.
Count on me, sir. All right, Pippi, history.
Take notes.
Okay, Mr. Neilson, if I have to learn this rotten old history stuff, so do you.
All right, in the beginning, there were... apples,
in the beginning, there were... apples, oranges... and bananas!
[ Together ] And Mr. Neilson loves bananas!
Into the rigging, and down with the mainsail!
It's plain as Pippi's nose, there's foul weather ahead!
Sorry, Fridolf, I can't study anymore. They need me in the crow's nest.
- Help! Papa! - What is it, Pippi?
A big wave... coming towards the ship!
- Come down now! - No way now! [ Pippi ] Help!
Take over, Fridolf. I've got to get Pippi down. Aye, aye, Captain.
Papa, I'm scared!
Lash yourself to the mast, girl!
I'm comin' up for ya!
[ Papa ] Hang on!
Papa, I'm slipping!
Hang on! If I lose you, remember the Villa Villekulla.
The Gulf Stream will take you there.
We'll come out on top like we always do.
Help! [ Screams ]
Papa! Papa, where are you?
I'm drifting away toward the island. The current's taking me.
Papa, it's taking me the other way.
[ Papa ] Grab hold of the raft.
Make for the Villa Villekulla.
Papa! Papa! [ Papa's Voice ] I'll find you somehow. I love ya, Pippi.
[ Papa's Voice ] I'll find you somehow. I love ya, Pippi.
I wish some kids lived there.
It would be fun to have best friends living right next door.
Hello. You kids live here?
No. We live in that house over there. The nice white one.
No. We live in that house over there. The nice white one. Well, who lives in this dump? Nobody. It's been empty practically forever.
Well, who lives in this dump? Nobody. It's been empty practically forever.
What did I tell ya? Absentee ownership. Probably dead.
We'll pull it down, and the whole plot'll develop.
You can't do that! We play in that tree over there sometimes.
Not anymore you don't! Come on. Take pictures of it. Lot of pictures.
I'll knock it down, and we pour cement as far as you can see. Everything living gets cut down.
[ Man ] It's another gold mine, boss!
We're drifting in the right direction, and we're not gonna starve.
Keep reeling 'em in, Mr. Neilson.
Mr. Neilson and I are very grateful to you for saving us.
[ Yawns ] But you've got to eat.
[ Mumbling ] That's all there is!
Mmm, not bad. - Blahhh! - [ Burps, Laughs ]
Well done, Mr. Neilson.
You might not be the prettiest monkey at sea, but you're the cleverest and the dearest.
- What about me? - Okay, okay, I love you too.
And now we must stick together, like the time when we were in Timbuktu.
So when Papa finds his way back, he'll say, "Well done, guys."
Wake up, Mr. Neilson. Another lovely day.
I hope Papa made it.
Don't worry, Alfonso, the Gulf Stream will take us home, just like Papa said.
[ Boy ] But, Dad, why would anyone wanna tear down Villa Villekulla?
Progress, Tommy. Mr. Blackhart has plans...
Progress, Tommy. Mr. Blackhart has plans... to build all sorts of houses and a golf course and a swimming pool.
to build all sorts of houses and a golf course and a swimming pool.
Sounds nice. Maybe we should move. [ Children ] No!
I don't wanna move! And what about our tree?
Aah. There's plenty of other trees, Tommy.
You and I'll go out and find another one together.
Besides, this town could use some changes.
Now, it's getting late. [ Children Groan ] Oh, come on.
Time to bed. Come on. Off you go. Couple more minutes?
Five minutes. Nope, lights out in half an hour.
Five minutes. Nope, lights out in half an hour. How 'bout an hour? No. Sorry.
How 'bout an hour? No. Sorry. Time for bed.
Time for bed.
Now, you know where we are if you need us, right?
Yes, good night.
You'll be all right? Yeah.
Love you. [ Children ] Love you.
Mom says the Villa is over a hundred years old.
They can't tear it down just like that. Just won't be the same anymore.
I don't wanna leave here... ever.
[ Tommy ] You know, Annika, there's something strange going on in there.
[ Annika ] You mean somebody's in there?
Or maybe even... ghosts?
[ Tommy ] Yeah! Could be even a ghost. Let's go check it out.
See anything? No.
Besides, you can't see ghosts.
Well, if you can't see ghosts, [ Door Slams ]
then what are we looking for? Shh!
[ Creaking Noise ] What was that? The step creaked. Don't follow so close.
The step creaked. Don't follow so close.
[ Tommy ] Look. It's up there. If I say run, run!
Okay. Where?
Okay. Where? Just run.
Look. Do ghosts have big shoes?
Give me the bat.
Can you hit a ghost? Shh. Stop asking so many questions.
You see? It's nothing. Probably just--
Hi. Who are you?
You're not a ghost? 'Course not.
The ghosts live up in the attic. [ Tommy ] We know. We just saw one.
It was big and white and had spots all over it.
That's my horse, Alfonso.
What's a horse doing in the attic?
Beats me. I keep telling him not to go up there, but he doesn't listen.
Alfonso, get down on the porch, where you belong.
[ Whinnying ] No way!
You see? He won't listen.
My name's Pippi. Pippi Longstocking.
I'm Tommy, and this is my sister Annika. What are you doing here?
I'm Tommy, and this is my sister Annika. What are you doing here? I live here, of course. Are you gonna stay here all by yourself?
I live here, of course. Are you gonna stay here all by yourself?
I'm not all by myself. Mr. Neilson and Alfonso live with me too.
[ Chittering ] [ Annika ] Oh, is Mr. Neilson your father?
This is Mr. Neilson. [ Chittering ]
My father is a sea captain who was washed overboard in a storm.
Did he drown? Of course not.
He lives on the Kurrekurre Island. He's the king of the cannibals.
Cannibals? Real cannibals? There's no such thing today. [ Pippi ] How do you know?
There's no such thing today. [ Pippi ] How do you know? You've never been there, have you?
And do they really... eat you?
Yeah.
Which reminds me. I'm hungry. You guys hungry?
We're always hungry. [ Pippi ] Great.

Oh, thank you. I'm-I'm so confused.

Suddenly in the middle of the night, some 11-year-old terror moves in.

But don't tease Mr. Neilson, or you'll have to come right back in.

That's because it's laundry day.
Well, that's enough of that. There is such a thing as being too clean.

What are we going to buy today, Pippi? A grand piano.
What are we going to buy today, Pippi? A grand piano. They don't sell pianos in there. They might today.
They don't sell pianos in there. They might today. Can you play the piano? How do I know until I've tried?
Can you play the piano? How do I know until I've tried?
To play the piano without a piano takes a lot of practice, I can tell you.
But how are we gonna pay?
Spanish gold. Pirates' money.
Pippi says you can find your own way home. [ Nickers ]
Do you want to go with him? No, not me. Uh-uh, no way.
He really is going home.
They missed a good sale there.
Hi, freckle-face. Don't you just love freckles?
Not much! Well, I do.
[ Pippi ] What's going on over there?
Children's home kids. Come for their haircut and teeth pulling.
Don't they ever have any fun when they come to town?
Let's go play with them.
What's wrong?
Orphans. Dad says we shouldn't.
Why not? They're just kids like us. Let's go.
[ Woman ] Quick, quick, quick. Come along.
Next two, please. Come on. You two next.
Hi! What flavor ice cream do you like best?
[ Shouting ] Chocolate! Vanilla!
Back off! It's against the rules.
Listen, I want you to go to the ice cream truck and get lots of ice cream...
and every kind of candy that they have.
Here's some gold coins. Okay. Now, go. Come on, Annika.
Here's some gold coins. Okay. Now, go. Come on, Annika. You won't get away with this.
You won't get away with this.
I'm telling Miss Bannister, and she'll soon settle your hash. Miss Bannister?
Miss Bannister?
That settles it. Now we're gonna have a ball.
[ Girl ] Miss Bannister? There's this girl.
She's creating havoc. There's this girl. She-- She went up there.
I don't see anyone. You silly, stupid girl.
Now, you mean you want 64 ice cream cones?
And Nestle's Crunch. And bubble gum.
And can we have 265 Oh Henry! bars?
[ Laughing ] You just help yourselves. It's all yours!
Come on, kids! It's Pippi Longstocking Day!
♪♪ [ Drumbeats, Accordion ]
♪♪
The ice cream! Let's get the ice cream.
That's really something, eh? Those poor kids never had such a treat.
Come on, kids! Come and get it!
Free ice cream!
There's always been a lot of talk about Villa Villekulla being an old pirate hangout.
There's always been a lot of talk about Villa Villekulla being an old pirate hangout. But I-- [ Children Shouting ]
But I-- [ Children Shouting ] I never heard anything about a buried treasure inside.
There must be records. Deeds? A bill of sale? Anything!
Look, I want that place.
And I'm willing to pay any legal costs to get it, if you know what I mean.
- Ohhh! - [ Laughing ] Tommy, throw some more. Hurry!
[ Gasps ] Well, go and get 'em! Yes, Miss Bannister.
Tommy!
I think we've done enough shopping for today. I'll be right back.
[ Child ] Hey, get some more pistachio, strawberry!
[ Child ] Hey, get some more pistachio, strawberry! Keep your eyes peeled.
Annika! Tom--
Annika! Tom-- You... dirty rat!
- Okay, Mr. Neilson, time to do your stuff. - Here we go. Here we go.
[ Whistle Blows ] You do something! Arrest somebody!
Yes, ma'am. [ Whistle Blows ]
Annika!
Tommy! Eh, watch it! Tommy!
Would you get out of my-- Get--
Would you get out of my-- Get-- Tommy!
All aboard! Come on, Annika.
Go! Come on!
- Tommy, Annika, come down this minute! - Hold on!
No, no! Stay up! - Bye, Dad! See you at dinner! - You'll pay for this!
- Bye, Dad! See you at dinner! - You'll pay for this!
I know who's responsible for this!
Riding on a motorcycle! Flying through the air!
I don't know what I would have done if they had crashed.
Honey, Pippi got them home safely as she always does.
That's what's important.
I've got a feeling Pippi would never put those kids' lives in danger.
Do you know, she told me...
that she used to ride with her father on the Wall of Death in Bangkok?
And you believe that?
That Pippi is the biggest darned liar that I have ever seen.
And I'll tell you what. There's going to be trouble.
That Miss Bannister is on the warpath. She's gonna have her way with Pippi yet.
What a shame. [ Annika ] Whee!
[ Annika ] Have you seen the splunk yet? I don't want him to get me.
[ Tommy ] I'll protect you if it does.
Be careful, and don't touch the floor. The splunk will get you.
And when he does, he'll tear your legs off...
And when he does, he'll tear your legs off... and stick 'em in your ears.
Do you know, since Pippi has arrived,
I've never seen Tommy and Annika so happy.
I never even see them anymore.
I just miss our happy, little family dinners.
Look at you.
Come on! Then let me go first. I can't.
Don't touch the floor.
Come on! [ Pippi ] Get onto the couch!
[ Tommy ] Now you've got to get onto the couch, Annika.
Come on!
I did it!
What are you kids doing? Watch out, Mom. There's a splunk on the loose!
Watch out, Mom. There's a splunk on the loose!
I got it! Get out while the going's good.
Well, come along before your father sees this mess.
[ Annika ] We've been having fun, Mom.
Pippi, would you like to come to dinner?
No, thanks, Mrs. "S." I promised this fabulous swami in Chittagong...
that I'd never eat out on Tuesdays,
and there's nothing worse than lying to a swami.
Bye-bye. Bye, Pippi.
Bye!
Let me give you a hand, ma'am.
What are you doing up there? Looking out for a storm.
Well, come down at once, please.
Why? Do you have a new game for us to play?
I'm afraid this will be no game.
I am the welfare worker from the county.
And there is a place for you in our children's home.
I have come to take you there. But I already have a place in a children's home.
I have come to take you there. But I already have a place in a children's home. Where? Well, look.
Where? Well, look.
I am a child, and this is my home. Therefore I live in a children's home.
I am a child, and this is my home. Therefore I live in a children's home. And a very comfortable one at that.
And a very comfortable one at that.
But no child can live alone. No, no, no. It's unheard of.
Every child needs adult supervision and has to go to school.
[ Alfonso Laughs ] School! Why?
To learn things, of course. What kinds of things?
Reading, writing, arithmetic, history, geography,
all those things that a person has to know.
Well,
Fridolf taught me how to count, enough to count my gold.
And as for the other stuff, I've gotten along fine without it for ten years.
So, I'm afraid you'll have to find children...
for your children's home someplace else.
Well, if you would just take ahold of that beast,
I want to see what's going on inside.
Sure.
But if I were you, I'd wait and come back on Friday,
'cause today's splunk day and they're all over the place.
I tried to warn her... sort of. [ Crashing ]
That was a trap to catch a splunk. They're such a pain, always trying to steal my gold. Get away! Bug off!
They're such a pain, always trying to steal my gold. Get away! Bug off!
If I let them stay, they'd eat me out of house and home.
And that wouldn't do, 'cause then I'd have to go to the children's home with you.
Don't, don't, don't, don't!
I don't know how to thank you and those kind people in the town for thinking so much of me.
But take this and give those poor children in the home a nice holiday...
with lots of ice cream and marshmallows.
Oh, give it here! Wretch! Hey!
Oh, give it here! Wretch! Hey! She took my hat! She took my hat!
Okay, okay, I'll tell you what. Maybe I'll visit Tommy and Annika's school.
Who knows? Might even be fun. I love drawing and painting.
Good morning. [ Chittering ]
Mr. Neilson, you sure are the cleverest monkey...
for painting all these beautiful pictures. Thank you very much.
And the dearest. Ohh!
What about me? That's enough.
[ Mumbles ] Oh, hello, Alfonso.
I love you too, Alfonso. I'm so lucky to have you guys.
Got her, boss! Outta there!
Ah, there she is. Turning my property into a pigsty.
Ain't yours yet, boss. [ Laughing ]
No, but it soon will be if you two idiots do your stuff.
Listen. She loves those two stinking animals, doesn't she?
Right, right. [ Laughing ]
Hello. I'm coming. [ Tommy ] Come on, Pippi.
Hello. I'm coming. [ Tommy ] Come on, Pippi. There's rocks ahead. Don't worry.
There's rocks ahead. Don't worry.
Catch! Oh! Oh, my gosh!
They don't make china like they used to.
Don't miss these!
What a bozo! I work my fingers to the bone cooking for you,
What a bozo! I work my fingers to the bone cooking for you, and you mess it all up!
Here's yours. Oh, thank you.
Isn't it great to be alive? What in the world did we do before Pippi came?
Practically nothing. Fished, read comics, played ball.
But now every day is fantastic.
It's one of those "perodactyl" things.
[ Tommy ] That's Jake and his new flying machine.
[ Pippi ] Gee, I've never seen anything like that before.
- He invented it himself. - You mean he actually made that thing?
He calls it his autogiro.
He even promised me and Annika he'd take us up sometime. Except Dad says no way.
He even promised me and Annika he'd take us up sometime. Except Dad says no way. He thinks it's too dangerous.
[ Man Laughs ] There it is, boss.
Look, I can fly. Pippi, don't! You'll fall! You can't really fly!
Pippi, don't! You'll fall! You can't really fly! My papa always says that if you believe in yourself, you can do anything.
My papa always says that if you believe in yourself, you can do anything.
- [ Ringing Noise ] - Shoot. That's Mom. - We gotta go now. We promised. - Bye!
- We gotta go now. We promised. - Bye!
Bye.
Leave it to us, boss. Come on. Let's go. Okay.
Pippi, there are two official-looking guys...
coming through the gate with white jackets on.
Fantastic. I just love men in uniform.
But policemen are the best.
[ Knocking ] Anyone home?
County Animal Control. Come to fix your livestock.
Hey. What are you doing? What are you doing?
[ Pippi ] Watch it!
That's pirates' gold. And anyone who touches it will turn to dust.
Look, kid, we got an order to take your animals for their shots.
Nobody shoots my animals. Whoa, whoa. We're not gonna shoot 'em.
Whoa, whoa. We're not gonna shoot 'em. We're just gonna give 'em a few jabs. Yeah.
Hey, that's my rope!
That's it, kid! Aaaah!
Okay, kid, if that's the way you want it!
And that's the bully tree. You should be ashamed, picking on a poor little girl.
And that's the bully tree. You should be ashamed, picking on a poor little girl. Ohhh!
No sense wasting such a nice day.
You little monster, you!
- Let's play "find the hat." - Come here, you! [ Yells ]
Come and get it!
Let's get the gold and get out of here.
What? With her yelling her head off in full view of everyone?
Get that ladder!
That's the idea. The view's lovely up here.
I'm gonna get that strong-armed little freak if it's the last thing I do.
Then what? They've seen our faces. Here's what we'll do.
Then what? They've seen our faces. Here's what we'll do. We'll put her in the sack, and when it gets dark, we'll get rid of her.
We'll put her in the sack, and when it gets dark, we'll get rid of her.
- Here. Don't want you to get sunstroke. - [ Yells ]
Get up there! Go on! [ Mumbling ]
Bravo! Well done. Isn't this fun? I do it every day.
Bravo! Well done. Isn't this fun? I do it every day. You little brat! I'm going to pull those pigtails clear to China.
You little brat! I'm going to pull those pigtails clear to China.
- Come on, kid! - [ Pippi Laughing ]
Get off me! Get off me! Let go!
Let go! You've had your fun.
What's wrong? I thought it was just a game.
When we're finished, we can have a feast of Coke and cookies.
Put the ladder here, kid, and we'll call it a day.
Hurry! Come on! Move it! Get out of my way!
You idiot! Why, you little--
You go for her. Get her off that horse. - I'll get you now! - [ Whinnies ]
- [ Alfonso ] I'll get you. - [ Yelling ]
Let's get outta here. This is more trouble than a truckload of baboons!
Let's get outta here. This is more trouble than a truckload of baboons! Oh! Oh-oh!
They're never gonna separate us.
Uh-uh. Never, never, never!
All you had to do was grab the horse and the monkey!
We would've been rid of her forever!
And all that money just lying there!
Be back in a couple hours.
Get, get down! Come on. Get out of there!
It's not safe now. Come on. What are you doing up here?
I just wanted to see what it was like to fly.
Careful, careful, careful. It's dangerous.
They could take your head off. Who cares?
They could take your head off. Who cares? I once ran into a headless pirate in Istanbul. He never knew which way was up.
I once ran into a headless pirate in Istanbul. He never knew which way was up.
Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to wait a few years to fly an autogiro.
Yeah, you know, I risk my life every time I go up.
That's it. That's the idea. Vroom! Vroom!
Is that all there is to it? No, no, of course not!
Uh, see, you need these to keep you up... and the prop to take you forward.
But it's really a lot more complicated than that.
Well, I bet I could do it.
Can I watch you take off? Sure!
And feel free to come around any time.
I always feel free. Thanks. Bye.
Bye!
My pop and I have been shipwrecked so many times...
that there are only eight or nine islands we haven't been to in the whole world.
Weren't you afraid?
Well, there was this hurricane, and the peas flew out of the soup.
And the ship's cat flew past me stark naked,
and his fur landed on my fork.
Excu-- What do you think you're doing?
The sugar feels sensational between your toes.
I'm sorry, but we just don't behave that way in this household.
Sorry.
[ Clears Throat ] Now, tell me,
what makes you think that your father is still alive?
I know he is. He'll be back soon. You can rely on that.
I know he is. He'll be back soon. You can rely on that. Ahhh.
I can't see a thing!
I can't see a thing! Pippi, come in the kitchen. We'll wipe off your face. It'll be all right.
Pippi, come in the kitchen. We'll wipe off your face. It'll be all right.
I think I went a little too far. That wasn't funny, Pippi. Your table manners are atrocious.
That wasn't funny, Pippi. Your table manners are atrocious.
Listen, if I promise to practice one hour each day,
will you teach me all that table manners and stuff?
I'll try.
Now I want the real truth.
Your mother-- She is dead, isn't she?
Oh, no!
[ Gasps ] You see that cloud?
Well, there's a little hole in it right above my house.
Whenever I'm in trouble or I need advice,
I see her face right about there.
She always helps me one way or another.
You okay, Pippi? You want to play upstairs? I can't. Alfonso's dying for a hay soufflé,
I can't. Alfonso's dying for a hay soufflé,
and Mr. Neilson wants a banana split.
Good night. Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Oh, wait, oh. Hold it, kids. You hold on right there.
I wanna talk to you.
Just hang on there. Just hang on. Honey, I'm really worried about Pippi.
Honey, I'm really worried about Pippi.
She's all alone in that house. There's no one to take care of her.
Look, don't get yourself all upset. Pippi is not our responsibility.
This Miss Bannister, she has a lot of support in this town.
I can see why.
The county created the children's home for kids who are lost or have no parents.
And it--
It just seems to me that Pippi fits the bill perfectly.
Poor Pippi. No mother or father to look after her.
We've gotta do something. Something drastic.
[ Pippi ] The boxes are finished. Where do we put them?
[ Jake ] Be careful how you mount them. They gotta be fixed real firm.
[ Sawing, Hammering Noise ] What? Oh.
Oh, this is too much. This is just too much!
What the heck could she be doing at 3:00 in the morning?
Can we-- I say, can we possibly have a little peace and quiet here?
can we possibly have a little peace and quiet here?
Go to bed! Don't fuss. You're getting rid of her tomorrow, aren't you?
Don't fuss. You're getting rid of her tomorrow, aren't you?
I wouldn't exactly say that I'm getting rid of her. But, eh, eh-- What, you don't approve?
But, eh, eh-- What, you don't approve? You know I don't. Not at all.
[ Children ] Twelve times sixteen... equals 192.
[ Teacher ] Children, eyes to the blackboard, please. Tommy.
[ Teacher ] Children, eyes to the blackboard, please. Tommy. Tommy?
Twelve times twelve equals one hundred and forty-four. Annika?
Pippi, how can I teach arithmetic with you sitting there? Please come inside.
Pippi, how can I teach arithmetic with you sitting there? Please come inside. Well, I don't want to upset you. I'm just curious.
Well, I don't want to upset you. I'm just curious.
I've never been to school before.
Except in Wagga Wagga. That's in Australia.
They chased wallabies all day long.
And we had koala bears sitting in on-- Enough, Pippi.
I'm afraid you can't stay there. It's disrupting the class. Children, back to your seats.
I was just hoping all that learning floating around in there...
might fly out here and stick to me... and Mr. Neilson.
He's very bad with his numbers. Yeah.
I'd like to help you, but you make that impossible.
Whenever you're ready, come to school like everyone else, and I'll teach you.
But now we must press on. Bye.
Well, I guess we'll just have to stay stupid.
Oh, dear.
Thank you. Will you wait here for five minutes, please?
You have the order? Yes, yes, yes.
Good. Then everything is absolutely legal.
Excuse me. Is all this really necessary? I mean, she's just a child.
Excuse me. Is all this really necessary? I mean, she's just a child. A child? I've seen this child in action. She's totally irresponsible.
A child? I've seen this child in action. She's totally irresponsible.
But a fire engine? Now, why do we need that?
Because the brat climbs up on roofs and in trees. And I've seen her up there.
Because the brat climbs up on roofs and in trees. And I've seen her up there. She is more slippery than that filthy monkey she lives with,
She is more slippery than that filthy monkey she lives with,
not to mention that stinking horse of hers. Why the police?
Oh, she's very strong. You should see what she did.
She threw my men up in a tree. Then she lifted me like I was a baby.
That's some baby, I'll tell ya.
I think you'll agree we have to be prepared for anything this girl may come up with.
We are agreed. Now, nobody wants to be unfair or unkind to Pippi.
But I think that once she is safe in the van,
then the whole town can just breathe a sigh of relief.
Tommy, Annika!
Pippi, they're comin' for you!
The police, the fire engine, Miss Bannister! Just about everyone.
I bet my father's with them too. They can't take you, Pippi.
We're going to run away. Please come with us.
Yeah, come with us. Mom and Dad are trying to ruin everything for us.
Well, I've never run away from anything.
But I can't let you guys go off on your own.
So I guess I'll have to come with ya. Let's go.
Good luck! Thanks, freckle-face.
[ Tommy ] How we gonna run away?
It just so happens I might have exactly what we need.
Good God! Look at that!
- All right! - Get-Get out! Get out! - We'll go after her!
- All right! - Get-Get out! Get out! - We'll go after her! If I could fly, I could catch them!
If I could fly, I could catch them!
Oh, my God!

[ Sighs ] Oh, Pippi.
How could you have done this to us?
I always thought the kids would be perfectly safe with you.
That you'd look after them... somehow.
Here, boy. Come on. Come on. [ Siren Wailing ]
[ Father ] Stop this thing now. Make it-- Come on.
Will you please stop this dang-dong bell? Stop it!
Did you find them? Not a trace.
Boy, that Pippi has really done it this time.
Are you sure they were flying? -Looked like a flying bed to me. -A bicycle. She was definitely pedaling.
-Looked like a flying bed to me. -A bicycle. She was definitely pedaling.
No! When it passed my place, it looked like that autogiro thing Jake built.
Then let's go see that crazy flying goon!
-Come on. Let's get outta here. -Stick around. Don't leave in case they come back.
[ Fire Chief ] Watch out! Don't hit the horses!
I'm starving! What are you doing, Pippi?
I learned this from a native in Borneo. Don't worry. It'll work.
It'll work fine.
See? It works! - Wow! It really did work. - [ Pippi ] No sweat.
- Wow! It really did work. - [ Pippi ] No sweat.
[ Tommy ] What are we gonna eat, Pippi? What have you got in there?
[ Tommy ] What are we gonna eat, Pippi? What have you got in there? Catch. I don't feel like hunting tonight.
Catch. I don't feel like hunting tonight.
What would you hunt here anyway, Pippi?
Oh, lions, tigers... and cannibals.
I'm very good with cannibals.
Cannibals? Here?
Just in case.
It's very quiet. You don't think it's too quiet, do you?
I promise you, with this old gun, I'll be able to defend us.
Even if we should be attacked by a splunk!
Oh, I'm gonna go take a nap. Wake me if you need me.
And keep your eyes peeled.
[ Rustling ] [ Annika ] Pippi! Pippi!
Pippi, there's something out there!
There. What did I tell you? It could be a cannibal snooping.
You can never be too careful.
Wouldn't be much use running away if we're just to be served up for dinner...
Wouldn't be much use running away if we're just to be served up for dinner... with carrots and parsley.
with carrots and parsley. I'll bet they're looking through their cookbooks right now,
learning how to make us in a special stew.
But I'll tell you this: If they ever put me...
But I'll tell you this: If they ever put me... on the same plate as spinach--
I will never, ever forgive them.
Oh, Pippi, don't talk like that.
- [ Tommy ] She shot it! - Three of them just bit the dust.
Pippi, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a pirate, just like you.
Swell. And we'll be the terrors of the Caribbean.
We'll plunder gold and jewels and hide our treasures in a cave...
with three skeletons guarding it!
And we'll sing-- [ Together ] ♪ Life is a breeze We live it for fun ♪
♪ No apologies to anyone ♪
♪ We live on the seas We do as we please ♪♪
You've got it! And everyone would turn pale and throw themselves into the sea...
to escape our bloody, bloody revenge!
What about me? I don't dare become a pirate.
Well, you can come along for the ride and dust the piano.
- Dust the piano? - Look what I found.
From a shipwrecked sailor's secret stash. [ Annika ] Thanks.
Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Darn it! We forgot to brush our teeth.
[ Annika ] Go to sleep.
Without your help, darn it, Pippi never would've been able to build that contraption.
I know. And I'm willing to help, but it's night. We'll use searchlights.
Even if I could get the autogiro up in the dark, I could never land it.
[ Man ] We gotta find those kids somehow. [ Man #2 ] It's all your fault.
[ Man ] We gotta find those kids somehow. [ Man #2 ] It's all your fault. Listen, guys-- [ Man ] You gotta help, Jake, or we'll run you out of town.
Listen, guys-- [ Man ] You gotta help, Jake, or we'll run you out of town.
If you're not too scared to fly, I'll take you up at first light,
and we'll look in places these guys could never go, okay? Okay.
What's for breakfast? [ Pippi ] Dinosaur eggs, sunny-side up.
Pippi! The plane! It's sinking!
How will we ever get back? We're supposed to be running away, aren't we?
We're lost. I want my mom.
- We can't stay gone forever. - Robinson Crusoe did. He stayed for seven years.
- Seven years? - I don't wanna stay that long.
- Seven years? - I don't wanna stay that long. Three years, okay? Whew.
It's getting hot. Wanna go for a swim before breakfast?
Come on!
Pippi, you still got all your clothes on!
I know. It's more fun this way.
They can't have gone this far!
Hey! Don't forget! They have one of my flying machines!
Hey, listen. I'm the killer whale, and you're the shipwrecked kids!
[ Pippi ] Race you to shore.
- [ Annika ] These stones hurt my feet. - [ Tommy ] Always complaining.
[ Tommy ] Come on.
Oh, no! Our clothes! They're gone!
Somebody's taken them. They have to be here somewhere.
The dinosaur, I guess. A fair exchange for the eggs.
Now you know why I swim with my clothes on. What are we gonna do?
Nah.
[ Whistles ] Sit down! You'll either lose your head or make us crash.
There's no sign of them! Go back to the lake!
If I know Pippi, she'll be finding some way back home!

Grab hold of the paddle! Hurry! [ Annika Screams ]
I'm trying! Help, Pippi!
Get it! Hurry! We'll come out on top like we always do!
[ Tommy ] We're gonna go over the falls! My barrel's leaking.
There they are-- down there! I'll drop the ladder!
I think we'll make it! Help! [ Screaming ] Help!
- [ Tommy ] Look! It's Jake! Help! Help! - Go lower!
[ Kids ] Help! Help! [ Jake ] I'll go as low as I can.
- [ Tommy ] We're down here! - Hold it steady!
- [ Tommy ] We're down here! - Hold it steady! - Yeah. Okay. I will. - [ Tommy ] Help! Help!
- Yeah. Okay. I will. - [ Tommy ] Help! Help! Kids, kids, grab hold of it! Grab hold of the ladder!
Kids, kids, grab hold of it! Grab hold of the ladder! [ Tommy ] Help!
- [ Pippi ] Grab hold of it! - [ Tommy ] I've got it! - That's good! Stay there!
[ Pippi ] Come on! Get it, Tommy!
Hold it steady! Don't move around so much!
[ Pippi ] Get ahold of it! Hang on!
- [ Tommy ] Then Dad dropped the rope! - And Pippi grabbed ahold of it.
- [ Tommy ] Then Dad dropped the rope! - And Pippi grabbed ahold of it. Then we got ahold of Pippi. We all went swinging over the treetops and fire engines.
Then we got ahold of Pippi. We all went swinging over the treetops and fire engines.
Then we got ahold of Pippi. We all went swinging over the treetops and fire engines. And now you're making it up just like-- [ Siren Wailing ]
And now you're making it up just like-- [ Siren Wailing ]
And everybody lived happily ever after.
You know, when I grow up, maybe I'm not gonna be a pirate.
I'm seriously thinking of changing it to a pilot.
Pippi, I don't think you understand.
You really went too far this time.
But there's good old Villa Villekulla still there.
Nobody's been hurt, and we all did things we've never done before, and we had a ball.
[ Kids ] Bye, Pippi! Sleep tight! See you!
Bye! See you tomorrow!
[ Pippi ] You got a neat fire engine.
Well, I hope you're satisfied, young lady.
All those poor people out of their beds and out of their minds...
All those poor people out of their beds and out of their minds... because of your stupidity-- psst, psst, psst--
and your irresponsibili-- bility.
Hi, Alfonso. You okay? [ Whinnying ]
You know, quite often, people go to bed too early anyway...
just because they haven't had anything exciting to do.
I do wish I'd asked that nice man for a ride on his fire engine.
[ Sighs ] Do you realize all those people...
have lost time and money searching for you?
Well, if that's the only problem, I've got tons of gold inside.
Come on in.
I don't want anybody to be unhappy,
so they can each have two gold coins from the Spanish Main...
to remind them of this fantastic day.
[ Groans ] This place. It's still a pigsty.
It's worse than ever.
[ Pippi ] When you've been on an expedition like we were,
you expect things to get a little dusty.
You see? [ Coins Clatter To Ground ]
What day is it? It's Friday.
Great.
I can start spring cleaning. You can help too. Hmm?
Don't you realize that it's 2:00 in the morning?
All normal children are in bed.
Pippi, dear, you can't go on like this.
You're worn out. You're dirty. [ Yawning ]
And you have no sense of values.
Now, I want you to listen just once-- just once.
We have this home... where children like you are looked after when they have no mothers or fathers.
where children like you are looked after when they have no mothers or fathers.
Now, I have the power to force you--
I urge you to come along peacefully.
This is for your own good. Now, please.
This is for your own good. Now, please. Just try. Just, say, till Christmas?
Can I ride the fire engine?
If that's what it takes.
Just till Christmas.
Don't worry, Counselor. I'll keep my eye on her.
Boy, I hope we've done the right thing. My children are just gonna hate me.
They'll adjust, like we all must eventually. [ Chuckles ]
Thank you for your help. Thank you. Yeah, and thank you.
Mr. Settigren, excuse me. Any luck with the search?
[ Sighs ] No. No. I can't seem to find any record of a sea captain...
with the name of "Efraim" or "Longstocking."
And the Coast Guard registry doesn't have any ship listed under the name of Hoptoad.
However, I am going to have a guard posted at the Villa Villekulla...
just in case anybody gets any ideas about any empty property,
just until we get to the bottom of this.
Get off my car! [ Grunts ]
[ Woman ] Class, I want you to go to work on the 12 problems I've given you...
while I go to work on another little problem.
[ All ] Yes, Miss Messerschmidt.
Pippilotta-- If that really is your ridiculous name--
I want to know: How much is 12 and 15?
If you don't know something as simple as that, you shouldn't be teaching.
If you don't know something as simple as that, you shouldn't be teaching. - I won't stand for rudeness in this class. - Then please sit down.
- I won't stand for rudeness in this class. - Then please sit down.
I'm warning you, young lady. We have ways of dealing with rude, unruly children.
- Haven't we, class? - [ All ] Yes, Miss Messerschmidt.
For your information, 12 and 15 are 27.
But if you knew, why did you ask me?
Thirteen plus fourteen?
Oh, about 67.
No. It's 27.
But you just said 12 and 15 was 27. I do wish you'd make up your mind.
Ouch! That hurt! That was my intention. You've asked for it.
That was my intention. You've asked for it.
Now, go over there, and don't speak another word till I give you permission.
It's no good. They won't even let her come to the window.
She's being disciplined. [ Tommy ] Poor Pippi.
Do you think we'll ever see her again? Oh, I'm sure we will.
[ Girl ] Jennifer! Away!
[ Girls Giggling ] [ Girl ] Thank you.
What'd you do that for? You know very well.
Hey, Pippi, you'll make the pillow all dirty.
In Australia, everybody sleeps upside down.
[ All Laughing ] I think it's time someone told you that in Australia...
it's strictly against the law to have lessons.
It may happen that one Aussie kid might sneak into his closet to study a lesson,
but it's too bad if his mother finds him.
[ All ] Whoa! How did you do that?
Arithmetic-- They don't have at all in China.
If any kid knows what 12 and 15 is,
he'll have to stand in the corner all day.
If that's true, what do they do all day in school?
Eat caramels. There's a long pipe...
Eat caramels. There's a long pipe... that goes from the caramel factory right into the classroom.
that goes from the caramel factory right into the classroom.
And it shoots candies out of it all day long.
- What does the teacher do? - Takes the paper off the caramels for the kids.
You don't think they do it themselves!
You're nothing but a great big liar, like Miss Messerschmidt says.
And who said you could braid your hair again?
Why are you so bossy all the time? Don't you ever do anything you wanna do?
We were okay until you came. But why would you want to stay here?
They give us food and shelter, and they take care of us.
Sometimes they're nice to us, if we're good and do as we're told. [ Screeches ] What are you doing in here? Get out of my dormitory, you naughty boys.
[ Screeches ] What are you doing in here? Get out of my dormitory, you naughty boys.
I don't understand. Well done, Pippi.
I really don't understand.
Pippi! How can you make all this mess?
Wait till Miss Messerschmidt sees what you've done.
Just think. How am I supposed to draw a real horse on a tiny piece of paper?
- Miss Messerschmidt! Miss Messerschmidt! - [ Mouthing Words ]
- Miss Messerschmidt! Miss Messerschmidt! - [ Mouthing Words ] - Come quick! Come and see what Pippi has done. - [ Boy ] Whoa!
- Come quick! Come and see what Pippi has done. - [ Boy ] Whoa!
You. What do you think you're doing?
I can't leave you alone for five minutes without your disrupting the class...
and defacing the school premises.
Back to your desks, class, and carry on with your work.
You see that little hut? That's called the sweat box,
where really bad children are put.
Mom, I hope you're not too busy up there,
you know, playing the harp and all.
But you know what your Pippilotta's been going through.
Why do they ask so many questions when they already know the answers?
I mean, a horse is a horse.
I'm so confused.
If only Papa were here. Then we'd know the right thing to do.
I wish he was.
What? I didn't quite hear you.
Get a message to him? But how?
In a bottle? Oh, thanks, Mom. My problem's solved.
Oh. You can go back to playing your harp now.
[ Man ] Once, I had four jacks and lost to four queens.
It'll never happen again, though.
This little hand right here should be enough to win.
Yeah. Two bucks says you ain't got-- Flush.
[ Man ] Where'd you get that, huh? Where'd you get them cards?
[ Cries Out, Muffled ] Shh. What are you doing here?
What are you doing here? You're not a ghost.
I'm Greg, of Gregory's Gripping Glue. And I'm very sleepy.
Well, there's plenty of beds downstairs.
How did you get up here? You certainly didn't come through the front door.
- I climbed up. - On a ladder?
No. Up the wall.
Up a drainpipe, I guess. I walked up.
Now you're telling whoppers worse than me. Only flies can walk up walls.
And spiders and lizards and me!
How did you do it? I'll show you.
How did you do it? I'll show you. Give me your shoe.
What is that stuff? This is a very special glue.
What is that stuff? This is a very special glue. Now the other one.
It sticks when you want it to, and it leaves go when you're through.
I invented it, and someday I'm going to be very rich.
What do we do now? Now you're going to climb up the wall.
There. Go on. You can do it.
[ Grunting ] Well, go on.
I can't do it. Of course you can. You can do almost anything you want to...
Of course you can. You can do almost anything you want to... if you believe you can!
That's what I always used to say.
Okay. Why not? [ Woman ] ♪ Sticky situation ♪
♪ My departure has to be a fast one ♪ You're doing it!
♪ Sticky situation ♪ You're walking up the wall.
♪ And had to use my ingenuity ♪ Terrific! I'm walking on the ceiling! ♪ The going gets too hot ♪
You see? No sweat! And it was fun!
Anyone up there? I don't know. Those rats get bigger every week.
[ Whispers ] Whoa. Can you write? Of course I can.
Can you write? Of course I can.
But right now, I'm going to take my little snooze.
Listen, Mr. Gregory. They don't know I have this.
But you can buy just about anything with it.
If you'll stay awake long enough to write me an S.O.S., it's yours.
It's gold! I don't want your money.
What kind of an S.O.S.? To my papa.
Please write:
"Pippilotta in the jam pot. Come quick. Villa Villekulla."
It's a little bit more difficult going down.
Well, I can try.
All right. I'll put the note in the bottle.
Throw it down to me when I get down to the ground.
All right. All right. Give me your hands.
All right. All right. Give me your hands. Just for the start. Turn me around.
Just for the start. Turn me around.
Now, Gregory's Glue won't let you down.
Now, just trust it. Remember: You must believe.
I'll try. Have a nice nap. And thanks.
You're doing it, Pippi.
This is great.
[ Grunting ] Pippi, you're doing it! - I told you-- if you would just believe. - [ Gasps ]
I can't move. I'm stuck.
Oh. Well, just jump.
Papa always says to leave room for your toes to wiggle.
Here we go!
Thanks, Gregory.
Now, I want you to swim straight to my papa, and no stops on the way.
[ Whistling Through Air ] Well, that's that.
- [ Sirens Wailing ] - Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my God! Fire!
[ All Shouting ] [ Children ] Help! Fire!
[ All Shouting ] [ Children ] Help! Fire! [ Gasps ] Oh.
[ Firefighter ] All right! Get the hose off and get that ladder over there!
Get the children out of there! Hurry up! - Please let me through! Let me through! Gregory! - Help! I'm trapped!
- Please let me through! Let me through! Gregory! - Help! I'm trapped!
Don't worry, Gregory! Pippi's back!
[ Gregory ] The whole place is on fire! Please help!
Hey, shoes, where are you? I can't climb without my shoes.
[ Officer ] How many more inside? Oh, there are ten.
Oh, that Longstocking child! Pippi, how did you get down there?
My mom lent me her wings, and I flew. Oh!
Can't you ever stop telling those stories, even at a time like this?
There's a man up there, and he surely doesn't have wings.
[ People Screaming ] Come on, kids! Hurry, hurry! Don't be frightened.
Help!
[ Confused Chattering, Screaming ] [ Man ] Move those hoses!
Volunteers to hold the net. Come on! Come on! Come on!
The ladder won't reach. Don't worry, Gregory. I'll save you.
- We're trapped! - [ Firefighter ] You can jump as soon as they open the net.
-[ Pippi ] Tell the Glue Man to jump first. -Glue Man? What's a Glue Man?
My friend up there. Gregory, you'll have to jump first.
Don't worry. I'll save them.
- Now, it's perfectly safe. - He's gonna jump.
- Now, it's perfectly safe. - He's gonna jump. - It's all right. I'll get them down! - [ Billy ] Help! Help!
- It's all right. I'll get them down! - [ Billy ] Help! Help!
It's much easier than walking down a wall. What wall?
You got a rope? Yeah. Right there in the back.
Don't worry! It's all right! I'll get them out!
Bravo, Gregory! Hi, Tommy and Annika.
Bravo, Gregory! Hi, Tommy and Annika. Oh, Pippi, I'm so glad you're okay. We came to rescue you.
Oh, Pippi, I'm so glad you're okay. We came to rescue you. You'll be safe. Whoa-oa-oa!
- Come on! Don't be afraid! Jump! - Help!
It's Chrissy and Billy! Mr. Neilson, you're exactly what I need.
You've gotta jump! Close your eyes and jump!

I did it, and I'm all right! [ Billy ] Pippi! Help!

Now, you're gonna take this rope over there. Just jump. It's not gonna hurt you.

She did it! She did it! She did-- Uh-oh.
Put your head under my arm. Okay. There.
Let them jump. We'll catch them. [ All ] No.
Here we go.
What's she trying to do? She'll never make it.
- [ Gasping ] - [ Chrissy Whimpering ] You okay? Uh-huh.
- [ All Cheering ] - Three cheers for Pippi!
[ Pippi ] Careful. Mr. Neilson, where are you?
Mr. Neilson, come over. Run along the ropes. You're a monkey, aren't you?
Mr. Neilson, I don't want roast monkey for dinner.
- [ Chittering ] - Come on. Right now. Stop fooling around.
- [ Continues Chittering ] - Very well.
- [ Cheering ] - Come on, you silly boy. Okay?
[ Tommy ] The rope! It's starting to burn!
- Ow! You're hurting me! [ Screams ] - [ All Gasping ]
- [ All Cheering ] - Mr. Neilson, you're the best monkey in the world.
- I'm so proud of you! You were terrific! - You were great!
- I'm so proud of you! You were terrific! - You were great! Oh, I'm afraid I misjudged you.
- How can I make it up to you? - I'd really like to go back to Villa Villekulla.

Once again, I found myself on my own
and going to my mother's annual turkey curry buffet.
Every year she tries to fix me up with some bushy-haired, middle-aged bore
and I feared this year would be no exception.
There you are, dumpling.
My mum, a strange creature
from the time when a gherkin was still the height of sophistication.
-Doilies, Pam? Hello, Bridget. -Third drawer from the top, Una
under the mini gherkins.
By the way, the Darcys are here. They brought Mark with them.
-[Bridget] Ah, here we go. -You remember Mark?
You used to play in his paddling pool. He's a barrister, very well off.
-No, I don't remember. -He's divorced, apparently.
His wife was Japanese. Very cruel race. Now what are you going to put on?
-This. -Oh, don't be silly, Bridget.
You'll never get a boyfriend
if you look like you've wandered out of Auschwitz.
Now run upstairs. Laid out something lovely on your bed.
[Bridget] Great. I was wearing a carpet.
Here she is.
My little Bridget.
-Hi, Uncle Geoffrey. -Got a drink?
-No. -No?
-Come on, then. -Actually, not my uncle.
Someone who insists I call him "uncle" while he gropes my arse
and asks me the question dreaded by all singletons.
-So, how's your love life? -Super. Thanks, Uncle G.
Still no fellow, then? I know them.
You career girls can't put it off forever, you know.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
-Hello, Dad. -Hello, darling.
-How's it going? -Torture.
Your mother's trying to fix you up with some divorcee.
Human rights barrister. Pretty nasty beast, apparently.
[Bridget] Who? Ding-dong.
Maybe this time Mum had got it right.
Come on. Why don't we see if Mark fancies a gherkin?
Good luck.
Mark.
Maybe this was the mysterious Mr. Right
I'd been waiting my whole life to meet.
You remember Bridget.
Maybe not.
She used to run around your lawn with no clothes on, remember?
Uh, no, not as such.
Come and look at your gravy, Pam. I think it's going to need sieving.
Of course it doesn't need sieving. Just stir it, Una.
Yes, of course. I'll be right there. Sorry. Lumpy gravy calls.
-So. [chuckles] -So.
Are you staying at your parents' for New Year?
-Yes. You? -Oh, no, no, no, no.
I was in London at a party last night, so I'm afraid I'm a bit hung over.
Wish I could be lying with my head in a toilet like all normal people.
New Year's resolution, drink less, oh, and quit smoking.
Oh. [laughs] And keep New Year's resolutions.
And stop talking total nonsense to strangers.
In fact, stop talking full stop.
Yes, well, perhaps it's time to eat.
Apparently, she lives just round the corner from you.
Mother, I do not need a blind date.
Particularly not with some verbally incontinent spinster
who smokes like a chimney, drinks like a fish, and dresses like her mother.
Yummy. Turkey curry, my favorite.
And that was it. Right there.
Right there. That was the moment.
I suddenly realized that unless something changed soon
I was going to live a life where my major relationship
was with a bottle of wine,
and I'd finally die fat and alone
and be found three weeks later half-eaten by Alsatians.
Or I was about to turn into Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction.

[Bridget] And so I made a major decision.
I had to make sure that next year I wouldn't end up shit-faced
and listening to sad FM, easy listening for the over-30s.
I decided to take control of my life and start a diary
to tell the truth about Bridget Jones, the whole truth.
Resolution number one, obviously, will lose 20 pounds.
Number two, always put last night's pants in the laundry basket.
Equally important, will find nice, sensible boyfriend to go out with
and not continue to form romantic attachments to any of the following,
alcoholics, workaholics, commitment phobics
peeping Toms, megalomaniacs, emotional fuckwits, or perverts.
And especially will not fantasize about a particular person
who embodies all these things.
Unfortunately, he just happens to be my boss,
editor-in-chief, Daniel Cleaver, and for various slightly unfair reasons
relating to this year's Christmas party, I suspect he does not fantasize about me.

[Bridget] Or maybe I'm wrong.
-Happy New Year, Mr. Fitzherbert. -Happy New Year, Brenda.
Mr. Fitzherbert. "Titspervert," more like.
Daniel's boss, who stares freely at my breasts
with no idea who I am or what I do.
Morning. I need that Kafka's Motorbike release by 11:00.
Perpetua.
Slightly senior, and therefore thinks she's in charge of me.
Most of the time, I just want to staple things to her head.
-Publicity. -All I asked,
I only asked if he wanted to come on a mini-break to Paris.
Daily call from Jude. Best friend.
Head of investment at Brightlings Bank, who spends most of her time
trapped in the ladies' toilet crying over her fuckwit boyfriend.
Am I too needy? Am I co-dependent?
No, you're not. It's not you. You're lovely. It's vile Richard.
[scoffs] He's just a big knob head with no knob.
Is some people's opinion of Kafka,
but they couldn't be more wrong.
This book is a searing vision of the wounds our century has inflicted
on traditional masculinity.
It's positively Vonnegutesque.
Thank you for calling, Professor Leavis.
-Guest list for launch party. -Ah.
F.R. Leavis?
Wow.
The F.R. Leavis who wrote Mass Civilization and Minority Culture? Mmm-hmm.
The F.R. Leavis who died in 1978?
Amazing.
[Bridget] Emergency summit with urban family for coherent discussion of career crisis.
Fuck them. Fuck the lot of them.
Tell them they can stick fucking Leavis up their fucking arses.
Good, good. That's very useful. Very useful.
Shazza, journalist. Likes to say "fuck" a lot.
Jude, what would you do if one of your assistants
made a harmless little mistake like that?
-I'd fire you, Bridge. -Excellent.
Is that Cleaver chap still as cute as ever?
Oh, God, yes.
Then I think a well-timed blowjob is probably the best answer.
-Oh, you love it. -Are you that chap that sang that song?
Yes. Yes, I am.
[Bridget] Tom, '80s pop icon who only wrote one hit record
then retired because he found that one record was quite enough
to get him laid for the whole of the '90s.
-Well, great song. -Thank you. Thank you so much.
-Total poof, of course. -More vodka?
No! Yes! Fill her up, goddamn it! Fill her up.
At least now I'm in my 30s, I can hold my drink.
-Mind the step. -She's fine. Drive on.
Apparently F.R. Leavis is coming.
Afternoon, Bridget.
What do you mean you're going on holiday?
What about Julia?
Yes.
Very difficult.
Well, he went to the meeting.
[Perpetua] Well, we could always get the bio. Yeah.
We've got a problem with the Teddy Knows Best campaign.
The only problem is the kitchen.
Quite frankly, there isn't room to swing a...
[Bridget] Message Mr. Cleaver.
Am appalled by message.
Skirt is demonstrably neither sick nor absent.
Appalled by management's blatantly size-ist attitude to skirt.
Suggest management sick, not skirt!
Right. Yeah.
No, I understand that. I understand that perfectly.
[Bridget] Very bad start to the year.
Have been seduced by informality of messaging medium
into flirting with office scoundrel.
Will persevere with resolution to find a nice, sensible man.
Will put a stop to flirting. First thing tomorrow.
Good plan.
[Daniel] If walking past office was attempt to demonstrate presence of skirt
can only say that it has failed parlously. Cleave.
[Bridget] Shut up, please. I am very busy and important.
PS. How dare you sexually harass me in this impertinent manner?
[Daniel] Message Jones. Mortified to have caused offense.
Will avoid all non-PC overtones in future. Deeply apologetic.
PS. Like your tits in that top.
[Bridget] Mustn't read too much into it, though.
And it all began, of course, with some very irresponsible e-mailing
over Bridget's nonexistent skirt.
Daniel.
-The New York office for you. -Yeah. Tell them I'll get back to them.
Daniel.
Jones.
-Evening, Kenneth. -Good evening, Daniel.
If you've got a moment, I'd like a word before you leave tonight.
Yes, certainly. Yeah.
-I'll see you in a sec. -Excellent.
-And Brenda? -Yes.
At the Kafka's Motorbike thing, thought it might be fun
if you introduce me before I introduce him.
Add a lovely sense of occasion.
Certainly, sir.
Psst. Brenda.
-What are you doing tonight? -Um, actually, I'm busy.
Right. Well, that's a shame. I just...
I thought it might be a charitable thing to take your skirt out for dinner
and try and fatten it up a bit.
-[chuckles] -Maybe you could come too.
-What about tomorrow? -No.
-Tomorrow's the launch. -Yes, of course.
Possibly the worst book ever published.
Well, in the end, that's not the ad line we've gone for.
-Then, next night. -Let's see, shall we?
'Night, Daniel.
Right. No pressure, Bridge, but your whole future happiness
now depends on how you behave on this one social occasion.
-Right. What shall I do? -First, look gorgeous.
God!
Two, then totally ignore Daniel and suck up to famous authors.
Salman. Salman. Salman.
Circulate,
oozing intelligence.
Isn't it terrible about Chechnya? Isn't it terrible about Chechnya?
Chechnya.
Introduce people with thoughtful details, such as,
Sheila, this is Daniel. Daniel, this is Sheila.
Sheila enjoys horse riding and comes from New Zealand.
Daniel enjoys publishing and comes--
-All over your face? -[Tom] Exactly.
-[laughs] -Excuse me. I'm terribly sorry to interrupt you when you're having dinner.
I'm terribly sorry to interrupt you when you're having dinner.
-It's just that-- -Yes. Yes, it was me.
Yes. Nine years ago. No current plans to record anything else.
-Thank you so much. -Oh. It's just that
your... Your chair is on my wife's coat.
-Your... Your chair, only... -Of course it is.
-I'm so terribly sorry. -Thank you so much. Thank you.
[Bridget] Hmm. Major dilemma.
If I actually do, by some terrible chance, end up in flagrante,
surely these would be most attractive at crucial moment.
However, chances of reaching crucial moment greatly increase
by wearing these, scary stomach-holding-in pants
very popular with grannies the world over.
Huh. Tricky. Very tricky.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the launch
of Kafka's Motorbike, "The Greatest Book Of Our Time."
And here to introduce it is Mr. Titspervert.
Oh! Fitzherbert. Fitzherbert. Fitzherbert.
Okay, circulate, oozing intelligence.
Ignore Daniel and be fabulous with everyone else.
I am the intellectual equal of everyone else here.
It's like a whole theory of short fiction and of the novella, you know.
And of course, the problem with Martin's definition of the novella
is that it really only applies to him.
That doesn't sound like Martin. Not.
I mean, I could be wrong. What do you think?
Do you know...
Where the toilets are?
Stay calm. Can't get any worse.
What are you doing here?
I've been asking myself the same question.
I came with a colleague. So how are you?
Well, apart from being very disappointed
not to see my favorite reindeer jumper again, I'm well.
Anyone going to introduce me?
[Bridget] Ah. Introduce people with thoughtful details.
Perpetua, this is Mark Darcy.
Mark's a prematurely middle-aged prick with a cruel-raced ex-wife.
Perpetua's a fat-ass old bag who spends her time bossing me around.
Maybe not.
Anyone going to introduce me?
Ah, Perpetua. [chuckles]
This is Mark Darcy.
Mark's a top barrister. He comes from Grafton Underwood.
Perpetua is one of my work colleagues.
Hi, Mark. I know you by reputation, of course.
Ah, Natasha.
This is Bridget Jones. Bridget, this is Natasha.
Natasha is a top attorney and specializes in family law.
Bridget works in publishing, and used to play naked in my paddling pool.
-How odd. -[chuckles nervously]
-Perpetua, how's the house hunt going? -Disaster.
Can't even go into it with you.
-By the by, that man is gorgeous. -Ah, yes, Mark.
Just give me time. Give me time.
[Daniel] You've written "a searing vision," but can you remember the rest of this?
"Of the wounds our century has inflicted on traditional masculinity.
Positively Vonnegutesque." Obviously.
Listen, you don't know where the loos are here, do you?
-Yes. They're that way. -Thanks.
One, two.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Hello.
Ladies and...
Sorry, the, uh, mike's not working.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the launch of Kafka's Motorbike
"The Greatest Book Of Our Time."
Obviously, except for your books, Mr. Rushdie,
which are also very good.
And Lord Archer.
Yours aren't bad either.
[clears throat] Anyway, what I mean is...
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for coming to the launch of one of the top 30 books of our time.
Anyway. At least.
And here to introduce it properly [chuckles nervously]
is the man we all call...
[Bridget] Titspervert.
Mister...
Titspervert.
Mister...
Titspervert.
Fitzherbert.
Uh... Because that is his name.
Mr. Fitzherbert.
Thank you.
[Fitzherbert] Thank you, Brenda.
Just switch this on.
So how autobiographical is your work, Salman?
You know, it's an amazing thing. Nobody's ever asked me that question.
Excuse me.
Jones, sod them all. It was a brilliant
postmodernist masterpiece. Oratorical fireworks, really.
You're looking very sexy, Jones.
I think I'm gonna have to take you out to dinner now
whether you like it or not, okay?
Come on. Get your stuff.
So how do you feel about this whole situation in Chechnya?
-Isn't it a nightmare? -I couldn't give a fuck, Jones.
Now look. How do you know Arsey Darcy?
Apparently I used to, um, run around naked in his paddling pool.
I bet you did, you dirty bitch.
-What about you? -Same, yeah.
No, no, I was best man at his wedding.
Um, knew him from Cambridge. -He was a mate. -And then what?
And then, uh, nothing.
You don't need to protect him. He's no friend of mine.
Well, um, then, many years later,
I made the somewhat catastrophic mistake
of introducing him to my fiancée.
And...
I couldn't say in all honesty I've ever quite forgiven him.
God. So...
He's a nasty bastard as well as a dull bastard.
Yes. Yes, I think that's fair.
Anyway, fuck him. Listen, don't let him ruin our evening.
Why don't you have some more wine
and tell me more about practicing French kissing
with the other girls at school?
-That's a very good story. -It wasn't French kissing.
Don't care. Make it up. It's an order, Jones.
[Daniel] So, how about a drink at my place?
Totally innocent, no funny business, just full sex.
No. I should get a taxi.
But thank you for the lovely dinner.
It's a pleasure, Jones.
Now, these are very silly little boots, Jones.
And this is a very silly little dress,
and these are,
fuck me, absolutely enormous pants.
-Jesus. Fuck. -No. Don't apologize. I like them.
-Hello, Mummy! -[chuckles]
I'm sorry. I have to have another look.
-They're too good to be true. -No!
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
I'm wearing something quite similar myself. Here. I'll show you.
No. [laughs]
-That was fantastic. -Oh.
-[Bridget] Daniel. -Yeah?
What happens at the office?
Oh. Well, I'm glad you asked that. You see,
it's a publishing house, so that means people write things for us
and then we print out all the pages and fasten them together
and make them into what we call a "book," Jones.
No, do you think people will notice?
-Notice what? -Us.
-Working together, sleeping together. -Hang on... Hang on a minute, Jones.
Just slow down. It started on Tuesday, and now it's Thursday.
It's not exactly a long-term relationship yet, is it?
You are a very bad man.
Bridget Jones, wanton sex goddess, with a very bad man between her thighs.
Mum. Hi.
It's a truth universally acknowledged
that the moment one area of your life starts going okay,
another part of it falls spectacularly to pieces.
[woman] Anyone else want to have it oeuf? Don't be shy, madam.
French.
Have it oeuf with the WiseCrack Egg Peeler.
Now, nice, firm grip.
Put it in the hole.
Up, down, up, down, and off it comes in your hand.
Oh! Mind the overspray. Sorry.
Darling, if I came in with my knickers on my head, he wouldn't notice.
I've spent 35 years cleaning his house
washing his clothes, bringing up his children.
I'm your child, too.
To be honest, darling, having children isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Given my chance again, I'm not sure I'd have any.
Now it's the winter of my life,
and I haven't actually got anything of my own.
I've got no power, no... No real career,
no... No sex life.
Got no life at all. I'm like the grasshopper who sang all summer.
-Like Germaine sodding Geer. -Greer.
Well, anyway, I'm not having it. And I've been talent-spotted.
Julian thinks I've got great potential.
-Who's Julian? -The man on the Shopping Channel.
Comes into the store to have his colors done.
Potential for what?
As a demonstrator on his cable show. You know, his assistant.
Apparently, it's the highest-rated show on the channel.
Well, apart from the one, you know, with the fat people who beat up their relatives.
Ooh! I must whiz. Have you heard from Mark Darcy?
Goodbye, Mum.
Julian.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
[Bridget] And a few weeks later, it got lots worse.
-Hello! -Look at this.
[Julian] [on TV] ...hanging off this heart-shaped pendant.
One of my own personal recommendations
is this absolutely stunning matching necklace and earring set.
The earrings, measuring just over a centimeter
in genuine diamante with topaz and lapis lazuli
in a lovely mock-gold finish.
The exact replica of those worn at Wimbledon in 1993
by Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Kent.
Well...
Has she actually moved out, then?
Apparently she and this tangerine-tinted buffoon
are suddenly an item.
Half our friends have had them around to bloody dinner.
She's even taking Jaundiced Julian to Una Alconbury's tarts and vicars party.
That's not the Pamela I knew. That's cruel.
Still, um, could be a golden opportunity
if you spent the entire party
flirting with other women, it would drive Mum wild with jealousy.
-Will it? -That's how I got my man.
Have you got a boyfriend? A real one?
I have, Father. I have. And he's perfect.
[Bridget] Hurrah. I am no longer tragic spinster
but proper girlfriend of bona fide sex god,
so committed that he's taking me
on a full-blown, mini-break holiday weekend.
[Daniel] Just promise me we don't have to sit in any little boats
and read ponce poetry to each other.
He's also agreed to protect me
at Uncle Geoffrey's hideous tarts and vicars fancy dress party.
This can't be just shagging. A mini-break means true love.
Suddenly feel like screen goddess in manner of Grace Kelly.
Though, perhaps, ever so slightly less elegant under pressure.
Very quiet here, isn't it? Are we the only guests or...
We have a wedding this weekend.
I believe there are just four of you not involved.
[Natasha] You do the boats. I'll do the tea.
-Oh, Jesus. -Hello there.
Hi.
Well, well.
Take it you're also heading for the Alconburys' rockery.
-Yes, that's right. -I brought Natasha.
Get a bit of work done. Thought I might make it a not-entirely-wasted weekend.
How interesting. What a gripping life you do lead.
Well, I'll see you upstairs in a second.
Well, the weakness of their case
lies in the deposition they made on August 30.
"Season of mist and mellow fruitlessness"
Oh, fuck me, I love Keats. Have you heard this one?
"There was a young woman from Ealing Who had a peculiar feeling
She lay on her back And opened her crack
And pissed all over the ceiling"
-Bollocks. Shit. -What are you doing?
I'm boarding you. -I can't see an alternative. -Don't you dare!
-I can't see an alternative. -Don't you dare!
-I'm king of the world! -No!
Oh, fuck me!
-[Daniel] Piss and bollocks. That's it. -You stupid arse!
Bollocks.
-All right. -Fuck, no!
So childish.
Yes.
[Daniel] Darce, come on in! Water's lovely.
Come on, you're working too hard, mate.
-Daniel. -Yes, Bridget.
That thing you just did is actually illegal in several countries.
That is, of course, the major reason I'm so thrilled
That is, of course, the major reason I'm so thrilled -to be living in Britain today. -[laughs]
Yes, I can't understand why the Prime Minister
doesn't mention it more in his speeches.
-You should write to him about it. -I intend to.
-Daniel. -Bridget.
-Do you love me? -Shut up, or I'll do it again.
-Do you love me? -Right. You asked for it.
-And over you go. -[laughs]
[Daniel] I'm going to give you something to bite on.
Here. Okay? Pop this in your mouth, darling.
You're begging for it.
Stop it!
I've got to go back to town. A meeting's come up.
-On a Sunday? -No, the meeting's first thing tomorrow.
I've got to work on some figures.
We could just pop into the party
for a minute and leave really, really early.
Bridge, I'm really sorry. I just can't do it. I can't...
I've got to head back.
Listen, Daniel, if you've changed your mind, you could just say so.
Because, honestly, I don't see what could be so important.
No, well, you wouldn't, would you?
'Cause you don't have the faintest bloody idea
of how much trouble the company's in.
You swan in, in your short skirt and your sexy see-through blouse
and fanny around with press releases.
You know, this is the Americans flying in 'cause they're thinking of shutting us down
for fuck's sake!
Sorry.
I'm sorry, Bridge, I'm being a prat.
I'm going to arrange a lovely car to come and pick you up
and take you back to London after the party, okay?
If you have to travel alone, travel in style.
And, um, I also think it's very important
that you win this costume competition.
Good. Good start.
Now then, Miss Jones, where does this go?
[Bridget] Oh, well, here we go.
Trying hard to fight off a vision of Mum and Auntie Una in fishnet tights.
Seems unnatural, wrong even, for 60-year-olds
to dress up as prostitutes and priests on a Sunday afternoon.
Oh, holy Jesus.
Bridget.
-Where are all the other tarts and vicars? -Oh, dear. Didn't Geoffrey call you?
Geoffrey, didn't you telephone Colin and Bridget?
How's my little Bridget?
-Geoffrey. -So, where's this chap of yours then, hey?
-Yes, well, he had to work, so... -Ha! Likely tale.
Off they run. Wee!
Bizarre what some men find attractive.
-Oh, God. -[Pam] Darling.
Geoffrey!
What on earth are you wearing? You look like a common prostitute.
-Yes, that was actually the point. -Say hi to Julian.
Hello, Julian.
My dear, you and your mother could be sisters.
And what a lovely bracelet. It's what I call an "all-rounder."
Sort of thing one can wear with anything to any occasion.
-Have... Have you spoken to my dad? -Yes. He's behaving most bizarrely.
I think he was actually trying to flirt with Penny Husbands-Bosworth, poor thing.
She was very frightened. She's only just had her ovaries done.
-I don't know what you ever saw in him. -Shh. Bad man.
Didn't tell you either?
I didn't spend as much as Bernard, thank God.
-I'm sorry, Dad. -The way she looked at me.
Well, she loves you, really.
You love each other. This is only a temporary glitch.
Is it? I don't know.
I don't know.
Ah, Bridget. There you are. Don't worry. You're not the only one.
This is Penny.
Geoffrey didn't get in touch with her either.
I'm sorry?
I was just saying, Geoffrey didn't contact you either
to tell you that the tarts and vicars concept had gone out the window.
-Oh, yes, he did. -Oh, right.
Lovely dress. Very exotic.
What a shame you couldn't bring your boyfriend, Bridget. What's his name?
-David? Darren? -Daniel Cleaver.
-Oh! Is he a friend of yours, Mark? -Absolutely not.
I hope he's good enough for our little Bridget.
I think I can say with total confidence, absolutely not.
Well, I'm sure he'd say the same about you, given your past behavior.
-Sorry? -I think you know what I mean.
Mark.
[Bridget] Hmm. Looks like Auntie Shirley didn't get the message either.
Hi.
I just really, really wanted to see a friendly face.
Now, listen. I tell you what. I have an idea.
Let me finish this, while you go home have a... Have a long hot bath
and I'll call 'round, and we'll have dinner later, okay?
-Is there someone here? -Not that I'm aware of.
Unless that Bosnian family's moved in again. Bastards.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm going mad. [chuckles]
Listen, I'm feeling really bad, actually. I should have been there, today.
No, I'm sorry.
No, no, I'm sorry. At least I got a hell of a lot of work done, as you can see.
-Yes. -Just give me one more hour, okay?
Fine. That's fine. I'll go home and de-bunny.
And you know last night when I said that I loved you?
I didn't mean it. I was being ironic.
Oh, God. Yeah, I know, I know.
All right.
Thank you, madam.
Bridge.
Bridget.
This is Lara from the New York office.
-Lara, this is Bridget. -Hey, there.
I thought you said she was thin.
[woman] [on TV] I was hoping that you would want to be a part of it.
[man] Listen, this is totally insane.
I'm 36 years old. It may be my last chance to have a child.
Alex.
[narrator] [on TV] The male penetrates the female and leaves.
Coitus is brief and perfunctory.
For the female, all there is to do now is wait and wait.
We've had very good response to the Teddy Knows Best teaser campaign
and had various local radio bids
-for author interviews, which is good-- -Look, Bridge, stop that. I feel terrible.
The thing is with Lara and me...
-Well, you know... -No, you'll have to fill me in.
Well, the truth is we're the same, Bridge, you and me.
You know, we're two people of a certain age
looking for the moment to commit and finding it really hard.
And I just think that in the end it's got to be something extraordinary,
something which makes us go that extra mile,
and I think Lara, I don't know,
being American and all. Something to do with confidence
and being so...
Well, young, you know.
We've become very close.
Well, you've only just met her. She flew in yesterday.
Silly Bridget.
-You haven't only just met her. -No.
No, I got to know her pretty well
when we were in the New York office together.
Fuck.
There's no easy way to say this...
But I want you to be the first to know that...
We're engaged.
[Bridget] At times like this, continuing with one's life seems impossible,
and eating the entire contents of one's fridge seems inevitable.
I have two choices.
To give up and accept permanent state of spinsterhood
and eventual eating by Alsatians,
or not, and this time I choose not.
I will not be defeated by a bad man and an American stick insect.
Instead, I choose vodka.
And Chaka Khan.
Why do you want to be in television?
Well, I've realized that I've become deeply committed
to communicating to the public the up-to-the-moment and in-depth news,
both political and ecological.
What do you think of the El Niño phenomenon?
Um, it's a blip.
I think basically Latin music is on its way out.
So why do you want to work in television?
Because I'm passionately committed to communicating with children.
-They are the future. -Do you have any children of your own? [groans in disgust] Christ, no.
[groans in disgust] Christ, no.
Sorry.
[man] So, why do you want to work in television?
I've got to leave my current job because I've shagged my boss.
Fair enough. Start on Monday. We'll see how we go.
And, incidentally at Sit Up Britain
no one ever gets sacked for shagging the boss.
That's a matter of principle.
Bridge, come on.
I know it's been awkward as arse, but there's no need to leave.
No, actually there is. I've been offered a job in television.
-Television? -Mmm.
And they want me to start straightaway.
So I've got to leave in about... Ooh, three minutes.
So...
Would you just... Just hold it right there, Miss Jones?
I'm sorry to inform you, but I think you will find that by contract
you are expected to give at least six weeks' notice. Ah, yes, well, I thought with the company being
Ah, yes, well, I thought with the company being
in so much trouble and all,
you wouldn't really miss the person who
"waltzes in, in a see-through top and fannies about with the press releases."
-Bridget. -I want to hear this.
Because if she gives one inch,
I am going to fire her bony little bottom anyway for being totally spineless.
What?
I just think you should know that, um,
there are lots of prospects here for a talented--
-Daniel. -Just give me a minute, would you, Simon?
-Thanks. -Right, boss man.
Lots of prospects for a person who, uh,
you know, perhaps for personal reasons has been
slightly overlooked professionally.
Thank you, Daniel. That is very good to know.
But if staying here means working within 10 yards of you,
frankly, I'd rather have a job wiping Saddam Hussein's arse.
Well, bye, everyone.
Oh, just sod off.
[man] [on TV] Hello and welcome to Sit Up Britain, a current affairs show...
Okay, everybody, it is bonfire night and we are on fire.
We have live fire station feeds from Newcastle,
Swansea, Sheffield, and Lewisham just poised for tragedy.
Bridget Jones, where are you?
I'm here, Richard.
Put on some more make-up. I want you on camera.
I'm thinking miniskirt, I'm thinking fireman's helmet.
I want you pointing a hose, I want you sliding down the pole
and then go straight to the interview.
Great. I'll do it.
No problem. Fine. Right.
So, you drop into the shot, and then interview Chief Fireman Bevan.
Yep. Yep. Yep. Go, go. Go, go. Go!
-Go? -Oh, no.
We're going to fire-fighters in Newcastle first.
Stop! Climb back up! Climb back up!
-On you in 30 seconds. -Okay.
Neville, what the fuck is going on?
She's supposed to be sliding down the pole, not climbing up it.
-Go, go. Go, go. Go! -Oh! Okay!
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Okay, we're out of time. Just wind her up.
Well, that seems to be about all we've got time for down here in Lewisham.
Chief Officer Bevan, thank you very much.
Excellent fire station.
And now back to the studio.
[Bridget] Excellent. Am national laughingstock.
Have bottom the size of Brazil
am daughter of broken home, am rubbish at everything, and...
Oh, God, am having dinner with Magda and Jeremy.
The only thing worse than a smug, married couple,
lots of smug, married couples.
Right, everyone, this is Bridget.
Bridge, this is Hugo and Jane. And obviously you know Cosmo and Woney.
-Hi, Bridge. -Hi, Bridge.
-This is Alastair and Henrietta. -Hello.
-Julia and Michael. -[both] Hey.
-Joanne and Paul. -[both] Hello.
And Jeremy's partners from chambers, this is Natasha Glenville and Mark Darcy.
-Hi, there. -Hello.
-Not in your bunny-girl outfit today? -No.
We bunnies only wear our tails on very special occasions.
-Right, B. Sit yourself down. -Right.
Hey, Bridge, how's your love life? Oh. [chuckles]
Still going out with that publishing chappie?
Uh, no, no, actually.
-Never dip your nib in the office ink. -[chuckles]
Right. [chuckles]
You really ought to hurry up and get sprogged up, old girl.
Time's a running out. Tick-tock.
Yes. Yes.
Tell me, is it one in four marriages that ends in divorce now or one in three?
One in three.
Seriously, that office is full of single girls in their 30s.
Fine physical specimens, but they just can't seem to hold down a chap.
Yes, why is it there are so many unmarried women in their 30s these days, Bridget?
Oh, I don't know.
I suppose it doesn't help that underneath our clothes,
our entire bodies are covered in scales.
I very much enjoyed your Lewisham fire report, by the way.
Thank you.
Yeah, well.
It didn't work out with Daniel Cleaver?
No, it didn't.
I'm delighted to hear it.
Look, are you and Cosmo in this together?
I mean, you seem to go out of your way to try to make me feel
like a complete idiot every time I see you,
and you really needn't bother.
I already feel like an idiot most of the time anyway,
with or without a fireman's pole.
That will be my taxi. Goodnight.
Look, um, I'm sorry if I've been...
What?
I don't think you're an idiot at all.
I mean, there are elements of the ridiculous about you.
Your mother's pretty interesting.
And you really are an appallingly bad public speaker.
And you tend to let whatever is in your head
come out of your mouth without much consideration of the consequences.
I realize that when I met you at the turkey curry buffet
that I was unforgivably rude and wearing a reindeer jumper
that my mother had given me the day before.
But the thing is...
What I'm trying to say, very inarticulately is
that, in fact, perhaps, despite appearances,
I like you very much.
Apart from the smoking, and the drinking, and the vulgar mother,
-and the verbal diarrhea. -No, I like you very much just as you are.
Mark, we really are making progress on the case in here.
Jeremy's had a most brilliant idea.
Right. Right.
I must go, because...
Bye.
"Just as you are"? Not thinner? Not cleverer?
Not with slightly bigger breasts and a slightly smaller nose?
Well, fuck me.
But this is someone you hate, right?
Yes, yes, I hate him.
[Bridget] November 9. Weight: 138 pounds.
Cigarettes: Three. Birthday: 33.
Okay, Bridget. See if you can get it right this time.
The verdict in the Aghani-Heaney case is expected today.
Get yourself down to the high court. I want a hardheaded interview.
-You do know the Aghani-Heaney case? -Yes, of course.
Big case
featuring someone called "Aghani-Heaney."
Or two people called Kafir Aghani and Eleanor Heaney?
That's the one. [chuckles]
She's a British aid worker. He's a Kurdish freedom fighter.
The government want to extradite him home where he will certainly be executed.
She's married to him, and they've fought for five years to keep him here.
-Today is the decision. -That's exciting.
Yes, it is. So what are you waiting for?
[Bridget] Am suddenly hardheaded journalist
ruthlessly committed to promoting justice and liberty.
Nothing can distract me from my dedication to the pursuit of truth.
Well, almost nothing.
Right. I'll just pop to the shop quickly for some ciggies.
14p for the Polos and a packet of Wheat Crunchies.
-[Mark] A packet of Embassy, please. -I'm sorry. I'm not quite.
Good afternoon.
Hi.
You like me just the way I am.
-Sorry? -Nothing.
Bridget, we fucked up utterly.
Eleanor Heaney and Kafir Aghani have come and gone.
Oh, God. I'll be sacked.
-Did the others get interviews? -I don't know. I was having a slash.
-Actually, nobody got interviews. -So how do you know?
Because I was defending him and I told him not to give any interviews.
Look, I have a plan.
And action.
Mr. Darcy, you were defending Mr. Aghani. You must be delighted.
Yes, Kafir Aghani has spent his entire life
defending the basic human rights of his own people,
and today's verdict has been the result of five years of struggle by this woman
Eleanor Heaney to save the man she loves from
an extradition order that would've been tantamount to a death sentence.
Right.
And, Eleanor, over to you.
Did you fancy Kafir the first time that you saw him?
This has been Bridget Jones for Sit Up Britain
with, let's face it, a bit of a crush now, actually.
Good afternoon.
Bridget Jones. Already a legend.
[Bridget] Oh, joy, I am broadcasting genius
celebrating by cooking birthday feast for close friends.
Have sneaking suspicion am also something of genius in the kitchen as well.
"Tie flavor-enhancing leek and celery together with string."
Right. String.
Perfect.
"Finely slice oranges and grate zest."
Oh, bugger. Oh, bugger, bugger!
Where the fuck is the fucking tuna?
[sighs] This is Bridget Jones for Sit Up Britain, searching for tuna.
Bridget Jones.
-Hello, darling. -Hi, Mum.
I just wanted a bit of a chat.
Ouch! Careful, you ham-fisted cow!
The thing is, darling, between you and me,
I'm not entirely sure that Julian isn't a bit of a shit.
You know, Mum, I haven't really got time right now.
Okay.
I can't deny the sex is still very surprising.
Do you know, the other night, quite unexpectedly,
I was just dozing off and I felt this huge...
Bye, Mum.
What time do you call this?
The door was open.
I, uh... I came to congratulate the new face of British current affairs.
But I see I may have come at a bad time.
How's it look?
Uh, great. It's, um, blue.
-Blue? -No, but blue is good.
If you ask me, there isn't enough blue food.
Oh, shit! It must have been the string.
-No, it's string soup. -[chuckles]
Oh, God. They're going to be here any minute.
Don't worry. I'm sure they've come to see you and not
orange parfait in sugar cages.
-Let's have a drink. -Yes.
-Happy birthday. -Thank you. [chuckles]
Did I really run round your lawn naked?
Oh, yes. You were four and I was eight.
That's a pretty big age difference.
-It's quite pervy, really. -Yes, I like to think so.
What are we going to do about this dinner then?
We can have blue soup to start, orange pudding to end,
and for the main course, you have congealed green gunge.
That is caper berry gravy, actually.
-Do you have eggs? -Yes.
Right. Omelet, it is then. With caper berry gravy.
You wouldn't by any chance have any beetroot cubes, would you?
Mini gherkin? Stuffed olive?
No, Pam.
And besides, I'm busy. The gravy needs sieving.
Surely not. Just stir it, Una.
Happy birthday!
-TV queen! -We're so proud!
Bridge, you looked so fucking thin! You looked fantastic!
-Hello. -Hello.
-Are you joining us? -Yeah. Of course.
Excellent.
Delicious. Really special.
It's really... It's really very good.
[Shazza] Really, it's very nice.
So...
Mark, why did your wife leave you?
Mmm! Eat up. Eat up. Two more lovely courses to go.
Mmm. Delicious.
I have to say, this is the most incredible shit.
-This is the worst of the three. -It does actually remind me of something.
-It tastes like-- -Marmalade.
[Tom] Well done, Bridge.
Four hours of careful cooking and a feast of blue soup, omelet, and marmalade.
-Thank you. -I think that deserves a toast, don't you?
To Bridget, who cannot cook
but who we love, just as she is.
-To Bridget, just as she is. -To Bridget, just as she is.
I'll go.
Who?
Ah... Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
I'm obviously interrupting.
Darcy. What brings you here?
Oh, right, yeah. I should have guessed, shouldn't I?
Hi, I'm Tom. It's really good to meet you at last.
Yeah, listen, I just came to...
I thought you might be on your own.
What an idiot.
Excuse me.
I've been going crazy.
I can't stop thinking about you
and thinking what a fucking idiot I've been.
Christ, is that blue soup?
Yes.
You know that Sunday in the country.
Come on outside.
It was all just going so fast.
The hotel and that weekend, meeting your parents, I just panicked.
You know me.
I'm... I'm a terrible disaster with a posh voice and a bad character.
You're the only one who can save me, Bridge. I need you.
Without you, 20 years from now, I'll be in some seedy bar with some seedy blonde.
And what about Lara?
Oh. Over. Over. Totally fucking finito.
Dumped me.
Dumped me when she realized I hadn't got over you.
I know you're thinking it's just a sex thing,
but I promise you, whenever I see that
skimpy little skirt on TV,
I just close my eyes and listen to all the intelligent things you'll say.
I was thrilled that little Kurdish bloke was set free.
Bridge, I've missed you a lot.
I'm going now. Bye.
-Mark, stay. -No, I don't think I will.
Listen, don't leave on my behalf.
I think it's about time you and I put this past behind us, don't you, Darcy?
At least stay for a birthday drink with me and Bridge, huh?
Goodbye, Bridget.
Mark.
-Why are you here? -Bridge,
I just told you why I'm here.
And why was Mark wanker Darcy here? Oh, bloody hell. Wait a minute, he's back.
-All right, Cleaver. Outside. -[scoffs] I'm sorry?
Outside?
Uh, should I bring my dueling pistols or my sword?
All right. Hang on.
I should have done this years ago.
-Done what? -This.
Fuck!
Fuck me, that hurt!
-What the fuck do you think you're doing? -This.
Oh, Christ, not again.
-Fight! -[man] What?
-Where? -Well, quick. It's a real fight!
[Daniel] All right. All right. All right. I give up. I give up.
Just give me a moment, all right?
Just let me get a moment's break here, okay?
[all] [chanting] Cheat!
I'll shin you!
-Whose side are we on? -Mark's, obviously.
He's never dumped Bridget for some naked American.
And he said he liked her just the way she is.
Yes, but he also nicked Daniel's fiancée and left him brokenhearted.
Good point. It's a very hard one to call.
-[Bridget] No, no, no, no, no, no, no. -[Tom] Oh, yes!
-I'm so sorry. -[groans]
-[man] What are you doing? -Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I really am sorry. I... I will pay.
-Had enough, Darcy? -Not quite, if that's all right by you.
[Daniel] You broke my bloody jaw!
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
[all] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday, dear what's-his-name ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
Jesus.
All right. All right. Enough.
Enough, wanker.
[Bridget] What is your problem?
-My problem? -Yes!
You give the impression of being all moral and noble
and normal and helpful in the kitchen,
but you're just as bad as the rest of them.
Well, I can see that I've been laboring under a misapprehension.
Very, very foolish mistake.
Forgive me.
Let's go back upstairs.
Come on.
We belong together, Jones.
Me, you,
poor little skirt.
Right.
If I can't make it with you...
I can't make it with anyone.
That's not a good enough offer for me.
I'm not willing to gamble my whole life on someone who's, well, not quite sure.
It's like you said, "I'm still looking for something
more extraordinary than that."
[Bridget] December 25.
Weight, 140 pounds, plus 42 mince pies.
Alcohol units, oh, thousands.
Bugger off!
Come on then, kids.
This Baroque carriage clock is a particular festive favorite of mine
incorporating the Hallelujah Chorus from Handel's Messiah
every hour, on the hour.
I can't understand it. The man's actually turned red now.
Merry Christmas, Pamela.
Well, I'm going to Bedfordshire.
-Night-night. -Night-night.
The thing is...
Well, close up, he was almost purple.
You're such a lovely normal color.
He had a filthy temper.
And, well, the jewelry is fabulous, and really very reasonably priced.
I thought I might ask if...
We could have another go.
I mean, obviously with some effort on your part
to pay a bit more attention to me.
I do realize what I'm like sometimes.
It doesn't help that you and Bridget have your lovely grown-up club of two
and are always saying, "What's silly old Mummy gone and done this time?"
You used to be mad about me.
You couldn't get enough of me.
What do you think?
I don't know, Pam.
I just don't know now.
It's been very hard.
Oh, Colin. [sniffles]
I'm joking, you daft cow.
Pam, I just don't work without you.
Awful.
Lovely. Lovely. Lovely.
Get back up those stairs, young lady. Get dressed.
What for?
The Darcy's ruby wedding party. "What for" indeed.
Mark will be there. Still divorced.
He's also still deranged. I'm not going.
Poor Mark. This is always a bad time of year for him.
You know, his Japanese wife left him on Christmas Day. Cruel race.
Yes, but I'm not quite sure he didn't deserve it, actually.
She ran off with his best friend from Cambridge.
Total scoundrel, apparently. Best man at his wedding.
Then Christmas Eve, Mark comes home early from work
finds the pair of them in a most unorthodox position
stark naked, at it like rabbits.
Just give me five minutes.
Stop! Stop the car! Stop the car!
-Dad, get out. Too slow! -Why?
-Dad, get in! Hurry! -What's the hurry?
Not too fast.
Bit snowy, isn't it?
Sorry. One moment.
Thank you for inviting me.
I didn't. It must have been my parents.
-So. -So.
Hello, Bridget. Didn't know you were coming.
Mark, your father wants to begin ASAP.
Oh, does he? Right.
Come on, Mark. Be helpful, please.
The caterers have totally screwed up. Does nothing work outside of London, hmm?
Apparently not. [chuckles]
Well, I have to...
Listen. Uh...
I owe you an apology about Daniel.
He said that you ran off with his fiancée and left him brokenhearted, he said.
No, it was the other way around. It was my wife.
My heart.
Sorry.
That's why you always acted so strangely around him
and beat him to a pulp, quite rightly.
Well done.
Can... Can we just, um,
pop out there for a moment?
Okay.
I just have something that I want to say.
you once said that you liked me just as I am
and I just wanted to say, likewise.
I mean, you wear stupid things your mum buys you. Tonight's another classic.
You're haughty, and you always say the wrong thing in every situation.
I seriously believe that you should
rethink the length of your sideburns.
But, you're a nice man...
And I like you.
If you wanted to pop by sometime, that might be nice.
More than nice.
Right.
Crikey.
[Malcolm] Ladies and gentlemen, could I have your attention for a moment, please?
Excuse me.
Of course.
...wife and companion, Geraldine.
A toast to her, my wonderful wife, Geraldine.
[all] To Geraldine.
And we, in turn, have been blessed with our son, Mark.
He's always made us proud
and we couldn't be prouder of him than on this particular day
because I'm thrilled to announce, he has just been invited
to be a senior partner in the firm of Abbott & Abbott in New York.
He also, incidentally takes with him, his brilliant partner in law, Natasha.
And I don't think they will mind, since we're amongst friends
if I say that, someday, this remarkably clever girl
is going to be something else in law as well!
I begged him not to say anything. [chuckles]
So I ask you now to charge your glasses once again
to Mark and his Natasha.
-[all] To Mark and his Natasha! -No! No!
It's just that
it's such a terrible pity...
For England
to lose such a great legal brain...
-Is she pissed? -What?
...for the people of England,
like me and you, to lose one of our top people.
Our top person, really.
Well, I better dash.
I've got another party to get to.
Loads of single people.
Mainly poofs.
Bye.
-Yes? -[all] Hi! It's us!
Great. Come on up.
Have we got the most fantastic surprise for you!
-No, you're not going to sing again? -Not that fantastic, sadly, no.
Still, pretty good. We decided to take you to Paris for the weekend
so you can forget about everything, particularly forget about Mark Darcy.
I can't believe you said what you said you said.
I know!
There goes my invite to the Darcys' next year.
If he didn't leap over the family heirlooms
and whip you up in his arms, then sod him.
Yes. He's clearly the most dreadful cold fish.
Exactly. I mean, there's been all these bloody hints and stuff,
but has he ever actually stuck his fucking tongue down your fucking throat?
No. Not once.
-Well, I think we should pack. -Passport, Bridget, and pants.
Yep. Pants.
Hurry up, Bridge. We're freezing our bollocks off out here.
Yeah. Just the keys.
I'm stuck up!
Come the fuck on, Bridget.
-[Jude] Close the door. -Bridget.
What are you doing here?
I just wanted to know if you were available
for bar mitzvahs and christenings as well as ruby weddings.
Excellent speech.
I thought that you were in America.
Well, yes, I was,
but I realized I'd forgotten something back home.
Which was?
Well, I realized I'd forgotten to, um...
Kiss you goodbye. Do you mind?
Not really, no.
So, you're not going to America, then?
No. Not.
-You're staying here? -So it would seem.
-Friends of yours? -[laughs]
No, I've never seen them before in my life.
Look, are you coming to fucking Paris or not?
Not.
-No fucking room anyway. -No.
Maybe we should just go upstairs for a minute.
-Yes, very good idea. -[Tom] No room for him either.
Close it down. Tell him we're sorry.
Uh... Give me just a minute.
Keep yourself busy. Read something. Lots of very high-quality magazines
with helpful fashion and romance tips.
I'll be right with you.
Definitely an occasion for genuinely tiny knickers.
Right.
Right.
Mark. Mark.
Mark! Mark!
Oh, shit!
Double shit.
Bollocks!
Oh, God.
-Wish me luck! -Good luck, crazy girl!
Mark!
Mark!
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean it. I mean, I meant it.
But I was so stupid that I didn't mean what I meant.
Oh, for Christ's sakes.
It's only a diary.
Everyone knows diaries are just full of crap.
I know that.
I was just buying you a new one. Time to make a new start, perhaps.
Wait a minute.
Nice boys don't kiss like that.
Oh, yes, they fucking do.
I'm delighted. You know, they're both really good friends of mine
and I think it's great that they've found each other at last.
Yeah. Brilliant. This is Pauline, by the way.
-Paula. -Paula. Paula. Paula.
Sorry. [chuckles]
How marvelous! Marvelous! [chuckles]
Nice, healthy, well-built girl.
Can't be doing with a girl who's just skin and bone.
I like a woman with a backside you can park your bike in and rest a pint on.
Malcolm.
Well, obviously, I'm disappointed.
Bitterly disappointed.
But, you know, Just because someone's got a boyfriend
doesn't necessarily mean they won't...
You know.
No, no, no. There's absolutely no bitterness, no hard feelings.
I just think it's great that in the same month that Bridge found Darce,
Ramon, hey! How's it goin'?
How you doin'? right there on the desk. There it is,
Where's she headed? She's snowbound, Ramon.
with the pink. See you went Yeah, yeah.
a pink day today. It's kind of
I'm gonna have another pickup for you on Thursday.
We'll see you then. All right. All right. Thanks, Ramon.

-Damn, how'd you manage that? -My dad set the motion detector.
Our parents are getting paranoid in their old age.
Mine still trust me.
It's beautiful.
Not a bad couple of decades. Better than the first two without you.
Better than the first two without you.
To 20 years of you and me.
And to our children, safe at home.
Hey, cool, you lost them!
Macho Mustang boys, to boot!
-We struck a blow for sisterhood! -The only "blow" you know.
Diss.
-Any raves? -Full Moon Underground.
San Bernardino. Probably Saturday.
I'll tell Mom I'm staying with you.
I can't believe you still work that scam.
What can I say? My 'rents are clueless.
I'll bring glowsticks if you buy gas.
-That's such a good idea! -Nice try, Beams.
Rest, it'll be one hell of a weekend.
-Bye, Tasha. -Don't let the bedbugs bite!
Now they call the cops on me.
Hello!
Hello!
I'm sorry I'm late.
Ruby Baker?
Yeah, I'm Ruby.
Whatever they said, I'm not missing. I just went out.
Your parents were in a car accident.
Are they okay?
-Ruby, why don't you have a seat, hon? -Are they okay?
My partner will help you have a seat. Ruby.
-I can sit down myself. -I know.
Are they okay?
-Relax. -We're here to help you.
You'll be okay.
Relax. Ruby?
You'll be okay.
-Get her pulse. -Can you hear me, Ruby?
"They are as asleep.
In the morning, they're like grass which groweth up.
In the morning, it flourisheth and groweth up.
In the evening, it is cut down and withereth...
...for we're consumed by thine anger and by thy wrath we're troubled.
Thou has set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins...
...in the light of thy countenance.
For all our days are passed away in thy wrath.
We spend our years as a tale that is told...
...so teach us to number our days...
...that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom."
I think Rhett Baker wants to say something. Rhett?
I just--
I just wanna say....
I just....
It's okay.
I didn't work with Dave and Grace or see them every day...
...but I knew them for 10 years...
...and I'm sure if they could hear this....
Well, Grace...
...would do her dismissive little giggle.
You know the one.
And Dave would mutter an "expletive deleted."
They'd hate to be remembered as anything but... ...ordinary.
Which is exactly what they were:
Anything but ordinary.
But they will live on...
...through their children and in all our hearts.
Ruby?
Do you remember me?
I'm Uncle Jack, your mom's brother.
I'll go wait by the car, okay?
If there's anything that you need...
...anything I can do...
...I don't mean in the next few weeks or months, I mean anytime....
How come I haven't seen you in, like, 10 years?
Have you even met my brother Rhett?
Well, of course I have.
I haven't seen either of you in years.
First of all, I live pretty far away. Chicago.
Then how will you help us?
I don't know. There's the phone, e-mail.
-You and my mom never wrote. -That's true.
As siblings get older, they go separate ways.
-You Rhett are close now-- -We're not.
We have nothing in common.
Used to feel that way about your mom. It's not true.
I used to think I'd take a month off and come out here...
...and get to know you, your brother and Grace again.
Nice to see you. Sorry things didn't work out.
-I'll call you later, okay? -Okay.
Ruby? Hi.
-I'm Alvin Begleiter. -Hi.
I'm so sorry.
I'm your-- I was your parents' estate lawyer.
I planned their wills...
...what they wanted to do with their money and--
The most important issue right now is who'll take care of you.
You and Rhett.
I'm assuming you know the Glasses?
I've known them my whole life.
Good. I know that your parents...
...chose them after a great deal of consideration.
And there's something else.
Your parents were extremely thrifty...
...and with your mom's share, your dad's life insurance...
...there's enough for you and Rhett for the rest of your lives.
Obviously you don't know Rhett.
That's good. I'll give you one of my cards.
I don't expect trouble.
But if you have any concerns any problems....
I'm an estate lawyer and also a trust lawyer.
I want to be someone you can trust.
-You call me, okay? -Okay.
Mr. Glass.
-Ruby. -Thank you.
My mom and dad would've loved that speech.
-They would've loved it. -Come here.
That's good. We're gonna get through this.
We'll get through it together, okay?
Oh, Ruby.
You're in good hands.
Hey!
-You guys ready for Malibu? -It'll be a change, we won't lie.
It's not the worst place. -Is this your car? -My company's, on loan for today.
-Is this your car? -My company's, on loan for today.
Sweet!
This place is huge!
Hey, Rubes, check out this view.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
-Cool, a meteorite! -It's art, Rhett.
Give them the tour. Stall them, I order dinner.
Let's get the lay of the land.
Master suite.
Home gym.
-Home theater. -Sweet.
-You never have to leave home. -If only.
Vicki comes in most days.
-Hola, niños. -Hola.
Hello!
This is your room.
It's temporary quarters, of course.
Unpack, get settled, and I'll meet you in the kitchen.
We're sharing a room?
Glance at me when I'm changing and you're busted.
We have a little calamari, a little risotto with mushrooms...
...and green salad with some Swiss chard.
-Do you have any Garfield? -What is that?
-It's crap in a can. -If it's crap, how come you eat it?
-Come on, kids. Try the calamari. -Isn't that squid?
-Honey, tonight.... -I'll call Domino's.
Thank you.
Can you turn and face the wall?
Who are you, the Blair Witch?
I'm worse. Just face the wall.
Turn that stupid thing off!
There's public school, then there's public school.
Trust me, there won't be any Bloods or Crips.
I'm not scared of getting gunned down.
-You're a great kid-- -It's not about being great.
-It's about being.... -New?
Middle-of-the-year new.
There's a saying we teach the Pain Ward patients.
"This too shall pass."
This too shall pass. This too shall pass.
Hi.
Why don't you take a seat in the back?
We have a new addition.
Would you introduce yourself, Miss Baker?
You just did.
Hi.
I'm Ruby Baker.
I used to go to Shady Lane. That's in the Valley.
Not my choice, just an accident of birth.
How come you moved here?
It was another accident.
Let's make Ruby feel welcome.
Thanks for the lift.
Sweet!
I can't believe it!
Like one of those isn't noisy enough?
No, Rubes. You can't play "Pokémon Snap" on PlayStation.
You can play "Ape Escape," but not on N-64.
Mom and Dad would freak out.
Don't talk about them.
I haven't seen one girl with blue-black hair.
The guys surf and swim all day. That sun-worshiping culture.
That sounds hot.
I checked my pager all day. I figured you'd call and you didn't.
Cell phones are banned at school. The kids don't care.
They can't see they lost their liberties.
They have so much sunstroke, they're wasted.
Ruby?
I got us an assortment of different things.
Some cold pastas, some salads.
Ruby, I think that you'd be well-served by a better attitude.
It's okay. I don't mind take-out. You're busy. It's not from Wendy's.
It's not from Wendy's.
I meant your attitude toward your new school.
-My attitude? -I overheard your conversation.
You were listening in?
No, I was trying to get a line out, but that's beside the point.
The point is, you need those kids to like you.
Otherwise, you'll isolate, sabotage yourself.
-You'll have a miserable time. -Okay, I get it.
I learned something.
Ruby?
Ruby.
-Wake up. -I'm awake.
-Wake up. -Mommy?
Mommy?
You scared the crap out of me.
I heard noises. I thought it was a burglar or coyote.
I'm not used to kids here.
Come here.
Thank you.
You must be freezing.
No more 3 a.m. swims. With all the glass, you hear everything.
I'll set the alarm at night.
Are you coming?
Drunk driving among teens has...
...steadily decreased, but we can do better.
As these images starkly attest...
...alcohol remains the No. 1 problem among teens.
This year, 20 percent of teenage drivers....
How was your first day of Driver's Ed?
-Fine, I guess. -They still show gruesome movies?
Those were the Dark Ages.
They have better ways of teaching kids today.
May I be excused?
Stupid, kid-proof piece of crap.
Ruby?
Was it awful? I mean, the driving class?
-I can just imagine. -No, it's....
I have my period.
Come with me.
Thank you.
Four doctors recommend....
This cramp, too, shall pass.
I'll turn it off when I get to a save point.
It's cool. I don't care.
It's kind of relaxing.
Erin, get out of there!
What were you doing in there? Tell me the truth!
-What are you implying? -Tell me!
No, I won't answer you! Good night!
-What the hell are you doing? -Getting ready for bed.
-Watch your language. -Don't play games with me.
-Watch your language. -Don't play games with me. You know what I'm talking about.
You know what I'm talking about.
I'm too tired to guess. I'm sick of your accusations.
Is that what you call it now?
-How many-- -I've done every--
You told me you--
Ruby?
-Hi, I'm Hannah. -Hi.
There's this rumor you were on academic probation.
Cut to the chase, huh?
I was. I had sex with the dean and he took it off my record.
Oh, not really.
I was supposed to be at my friend Tasha's...
...doing an essay, and went to this rave.
Sunday I was fried and downloaded this thing off the net.
-Tuesday, I was busted. -Hey, Hannah!
-Hey! I gotta go. -Bye.
Hey, Ruby.
My company's driving people to a premiere.
I gotta make sure everything run smooth. Wanna come?
I have homework, three more hours. Pretty heavy, so....
That's perfect.
Can we catch the end of the movie or go to the party?
Actually, the hell with Westwood.
-My drivers can handle a premiere. -Evening, sir.
Mud pie for the lady. Ketel One, rocks, for me.
Great.
Thank you.
That party'd be a mob scene. I really want to talk to you.
-Here you are. -Thank you.
I remember when you guys moved down the block 11 years ago.
It was funny. I noticed the furniture as they brought it in.
Erin noticed a little girl.
But you were upset. I guess about moving cross-country.
You wouldn't say a word.
Just hugged this plastic doll against your chest.
Malibu Barbie, I think it was. Prophetic, huh?
Think you mean "pathetic."
No, no.
-I guess you moved on years ago. -From what?
From hugging plastic dolls.
I should hope so.
Last night, when you fought...
...it wasn't about us, right?
No. Married people sometimes like to...
...push each other's buttons.
It's a form of intimacy, a lower form, nothing serious.
One thing I haven't said about Erin:
It can be lonely living with her.
But that's my cross to bear, not yours.
I think it's past my bedtime, Terry.
Of course it is.
Let's get you to bed.
Terry.
You're not wearing your shoulder belt.
Hey.
Try not to make too much noise. Rhett and Erin are asleep.
Okay?
Hamlet senses something's wrong...
Hamlet senses something's wrong... ...that he alone can set right.
I want two pages next Friday...
...about what he means and whether he succeeds.
Mr. Begleiter, before my parents--
They ever speak about guardians for Rhett and me?
Different from the Glasses? No.
-I think they wanted to. -They discussed it with you?
No, but my parents weren't friendly with them after they moved.
Ruby, the Glasses aren't your parents.
They'll never be your parents.
-If Erin or Terry has done anything-- -We sleep in one room.
That's not ideal.
The other night we were alone in Terry's car. He--
What? What did he do?
He just put my seat belt on.
The way he leaned across me wasn't-- It just-- And I felt....
I know it sounds stupid.
And then... ...Erin was shooting up. I saw her holding a needle.
...Erin was shooting up. I saw her holding a needle.
Anyway, she looked really baked.
Ruby.
Try and understand this.
The accident, in effect...
...orphaned you and your brother.
So if this doesn't work out with the Glasses...
...you've no place to go.
You'll become wards of the state.
I'm not trying to scare you.
I'm just telling you the facts of life.
I drove halfway here with the housekeeper...
...and then hitchhiked and I was scared.
But I told myself once I made it, you'd help me and Rhett.
When we met, you said I could trust you.
Okay.
All right.
I believe you. And I know who to get in touch with.
It's not gonna be easy. I can't promise you results.
But I promise you that I'll look into this. You have my word on that.
Thank you.
When we spoke after the funeral...
...you had said that...
...we had more than enough.
How much would that be exactly?
That's a question for the trust officer at the bank.
But between us, four million dollars.
So you can see, you're financially very secure.
Yeah.
Now why don't you go home. And do me one more favor?
No hitchhiking.
-This is out, okay? -Yes, sir.
Alvin Begleiter calling.
I just had a disturbing visit from Ruby Baker.
Rhett, why don't you leave that now?
Go and do some homework.
I have a lot of homework, too.
Stay a minute, would you?
What you saw last night isn't what you think.
Erin suffers from diabetes.
I hid it.
I don't want you or Rhett to worry. The disease is under control.
You saw Erin giving herself her nightly insulin injection.
Must've been a shock to walk in on.
One more thing.
Terry tells me that you got a little skittish with him last night.
That makes us feel sad. We want you to trust us, Ruby.
We need your trust.
I overreacted, I'm sorry.
There are still things I need to get used to.
We all do.
We're all under stress.
I'm gonna begin my Hamlet paper.
If you need help, let me know.
That'd be great.
That's fine. Put it in park and step out.
And Ruby? You'll get behind the wheel next.
You can apply a bit more gas.
Sorry, I'm a bad driver.
There aren't any bad, just inexperienced.
Take a breath, start driving back.
Bye.
He's not in now. I'll have him call you back.
Hi.
-I'm Ruby Baker. Terry's-- -I know who you are.
Okay. Cool.
I came to catch a ride from Terry.
He's having a powwow with some people now.
-If you wanna wait, there's a lounge. -Okay, thanks.
-Glass Transit, may I help you? -Any service technician to the office.
-What's going on, Terry? -The usual.
Not to worry. Nothing that can't be handled.
-We had a payment plan. -The dates arrive, the money doesn't.
About that payment plan Nicole had a day...
About that payment plan Nicole had a day... ...I'd call it unrealistic.
-You proposed that plan. -I know.
-It's not dishonesty. We gotta-- -What is it?
Naïve optimism.
But I'm an optimist by nature.
I'm betting on myself.
I'll be right there.
-Where's the money? -You're not listening. The money--
-Say is, as in, "the money is." -Yeah.
Can I help you?
-Whose car is this? -Hell if I know. Just showed up one day.
-One day, when? -I don't know. Few months ago?
-We had a car like this. -You really shouldn't be back here.
Ruby?
What happened was nothing. Just a business glitch.
Hope you didn't get freaked. People get weird about money.
I didn't mean to just show up. I waited for Vicki and she never came.
We had to let her go. Erin got held up at the hospital.
-Back up. You had to let Vicki go? -We had to.
She drove you without permission.
Just to Santa Monica, to the Promenade.
How did you know that she drove me?
How did we know? It's our job to know.
-Did you have a hard day at work? -It was fine, thanks.
Hamlet.
Don't you hate how he can't make up his mind?
To be, not be, not not be, be, be not.
My father drove a Saab.
Terry!
Thank you.
For finishing my paper.
That would be wrong.
-Ruby. -Yeah?
Come with me.
Sure.
Ruby Baker? I'm Nancy Ryan.
I'm an inspector with Social Services.
Your lawyer said you have problems with your guardians.
Please relax and be open. Everything said here stays private.
Please relax and be open. Everything said here stays private. Okay? So...
Okay? So... ...you're 16...
...and your brother is 11, and you share a bedroom?
Yeah, for now.
And you saw Erin Glass injecting herself?
-They said she has diabetes. -Diabetes? I'm gonna check that.
Now it's gonna be in writing twice.
My word still won't count next to the Glasses.
Which is why I'll phone the Glasses and ask them to meet me...
...so I can verify everything.
-Okay? -But...
...how can I live with them?
-Do you wanna live with them? -Sometimes things are fine.
Last night, Terry helped me with something...
Last night, Terry helped me with something... ...but maybe that was to keep me happy.
I know this is scary for you, but don't worry.
We tell the guardians that we perform a routine inspection.
If it's still in progress...
...you just act like we've never met or spoken.
You have no idea why I'm there. Okay?
This is my husband, Terry Glass. -Hello. -Hello.
-Hello. -Hello.
Is this necessary in the middle of the day?
We'll get this done as quickly as possible.
It's intrusive. Let's get it over with.
-May I...? -Of course.
Only one child sleeps here?
Yes, Rhett.
And the girl, Ruby, she has her own room?
-Of course. -She's 16.
Nice accommodations.
The kids are home. Do you want to meet them?
Yes, I would. Just to say hi.
But first, Dr. Glass, may I look upstairs?
This is awkward, but it's also important.
It's a matter of safety, so there's nothing...
...dangerous in easy reach.
-"Humulin L and U." -Diabetes. I'm insulin-dependent.
We have it totally under control.
It would appear that you do.
Here's the two best kids in the world.
Hi, you must be Rhett. I'm Nancy Ryan.
Nice to meet you.
So Rhett, how do you spend your evenings?
When I finish my homework, I read.
And you must be Ruby. You have a very nice room.
You've made a wonderful home for these children.
-Thank you, Dr. Glass. -Thank you.
We'll see you out.
You read? You lie.
Guess who I learned from?
Bye now.
Why don't we order some dinner, hon?
How do you like your new room?
Couldn't have come at a better time.
Come on, Mr. Begleiter.
-Hello? -Sorry to disturb you this late.
...but I found myself wondering, "Where's the money?"
You might as well know.
Six months ago I took on a partner. A silent partner and...
...I recently found out he was skimming cash.
You've lost me. What does this have to do with our loan?
I'm waiting, Mr. Glass.
-Mr. Glass, you still there? -Yeah.
He charged personal expenses to the company. When I want a heartbreaking human interest story...
When I want a heartbreaking human interest story...
...I'll watch the news.
Meanwhile, your payment's due tomorrow, close of business.
Do you fully understand me?
Mr. Glass?
I'm here.
I'm seeking full restitution from my partner.
Plus I found a whole new source of equity.
My big, new, personal piggy bank.
So you can expect another $30,000.
That barely covers interest. You need to pay off the principal.
But I need some more time. Not a lot more time.
A week at the most. We'll give you two days, because we like you.
We'll give you two days, because we like you.
We'd hate for you to find your beautiful house burnt down...
...with your wife inside.
Yeah?
"I unfold a tale whose word would harrow up thy soul...
...freeze thy young blood...
...make thy two eyes start from their spheres...
...and each hair to stand an end.
If thou didst thy father love...
...revenge his foul and unnatural murder. Murder most foul...
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural...."
Begleiter and Brice.
-This is Ruby Baker for Mr. Begleiter. -One moment.
-Did you get my e-mail? -No, Terry trashed my account.
Or maybe the bill didn't get paid.
Did you find out about the BMW?
Right, the BMW.
It was registered to a business: G.T.I.
Glass Transit Incorporated.
-Terry's company. -Now don't you get it?
Ruby, please come with me.
I have to call you back later. Bye-bye.
This is Miss Bassett, our vice principal.
Ruby. The paper you turned in to Mr. Kim, that was your work, nobody helped?
The paper you turned in to Mr. Kim, that was your work, nobody helped?
-No. -Not even Harold Bloom?
"Dance of contraries," didn't sound like a student.
I found it and other phrases in Mr. Bloom's book:
"Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human."
We were told there's a case of plagiarism on your school record.
You understand why we have to take decisive action--
You were told?
-By who? -That is hardly the issue here.
This sort of cheating has to have real consequences.
We've spoken to your guardians.
Of course you have.
Frankly, we're not sure whether you can continue at this school.
Well?
Why don't you ask Terry?
Or maybe it's time you took some responsibility.
Maybe it's time.
This is Jack Avery. I'm out of the country...
This is Jack Avery. I'm out of the country... ...but I'm checking my messages.
...but I'm checking my messages.
Wake up.
Don't make a sound. Get dressed. We're gonna go.
-Where? With who? -Away with me.
-Quit it! You're looking! -Like there's something to see.
It's raining. I was sleeping. I don't wanna go.
It'll be really fun.
They're giving away Dragon Ball Z at Blockbuster.
We can go and avoid the rush.
Really?
Close the door.
What if they find out?
I'll take the blame. Get in the car.
You don't know what you're doing.
Wanna slow down a little?
One thing I learned from Terry: Buckle up.
-Terry's gonna kill you! -Maybe so.
Turn that off.
Turn that shit off!
Look out!
You almost creamed that guy!
Right. Turn it off!
-I wanna go back. -We're not.
-What do you mean? -Figure it out.
We have to! You tricked me and now I'm in trouble.
-The Glasses tricked you. -What?
Did not. They're sleeping.
They were gonna send me away and you'd stay home with them.
I like Terry. I like Erin.
You like the shit they buy you. You couldn't see it.
You like the shit they buy you. You couldn't see it. They made you lie to that social worker.
They made you lie to that social worker.
I didn't know she was a social worker.
You didn't wanna lose your Nintendo.
They bought you off.
-Where are you taking us? -The point was to get away.
Crap.
Don't say anything stupid.
The highway is closed.
There's a mudslide. You need to use Malibu Canyon....
-Can I see your driver's license? -My license?
-And your registration too. -It's....
It's over there in all my stuff.
I think I saw it over here.
Pull onto the shoulder and step out.
Officer!
These are my kids.
Terry Glass, Glass Transit.
-We loaned you limos for the parade. -How are you?
Rhett, poor baby! Come with me. We have a behavior problem back at home.
We have a behavior problem back at home.
Your sister's going through a hard time right now.
-You know, teenage-girl stuff. -Got you.
Good luck.
Move over.
-You can turn around here. -Thanks.
Don't you have anything to say to me?
You killed my parents.
That's insane and hurtful.
You're threatened by your business associates. I saw it.
Like Erin said to me, "We need your trust."
You need my trust, $4 million worth.
I got a business. My wife's a successful doctor.
-I got a big, new-- -"Piggy bank."
That's just words out of context.
-What about the BMW my dad drove? -What about it?!
For their anniversary, I lent them a Beemer...
...so Dave wouldn't drive her in that Saab...
...which I repainted.
No good deed goes unpunished.
In your trashy mind, you twisted that into--
What do you think? Cut the steering, stripped the brakes?
Yeah.
It's understandable, basic psychology.
You don't wanna blame your dad.
That he had too much booze that night.
Then you'd ask why your mom and dad... ...hit the bottle. Whose behavior drove them to drink?
...hit the bottle. Whose behavior drove them to drink?
Get this straight.
You and Rhett are mine.
I suggest you forget your lurid, adolescent fantasies and start--
Help!
-Let me go, bastard! -Calm down, little girl!
What's happening out there?
Your sister is having a tantrum.
Come on. Come back to bed.
Let me go! Get off!
Let go!
You...!
Listen hard, Ruby.
Anything happens to you, we got Rhett... ...and all we need is one child.
...and all we need is one child.
Erin! Stop him, please!
Erin!
Please come help me, please! He's not gonna hurt you!
Erin, please don't! Erin, don't! No!
Thank you for listening.
You'll feel better now, Ruby. Rest, relax.
-Where to, ladies? -The mall. Time out. Has anyone heard from Ruby?
Time out. Has anyone heard from Ruby?
-Me? Not for a month. -Same. Won't even answer my e-mails.
What up with Little Miss Malibu? Too busy bodysurfing?
Then we are too busy for her.
-Hello? -Where's the rest of our money?
The bank sent me a check with the wrong zip code.
Some incompetent jerk at the bank inverted the last digits!
So I'll need another--
We gotta expand the house, a wing for the kids.
Our little boy gets bigger every day, and the girl is a teen.
I don't know if you have kids....
Anyway, construction costs in Malibu are off the charts.
I'm estimating a quarter million.
We'll need to see blueprints. There's an approval process.
You can't get them without an architect.
Mine wants a cash down payment. He's in demand.
I believe we advanced you...
...$30,000 for that purpose just last month.
But that was for a room, before I realized I needed a wing.
Isn't a guardian supposed to keep the kids comfortable?
Here's the trust.
It authorizes me to use money to enlarge the house.
And guardians aren't supposed to suffer economically...
...in fulfilling their obligations? I'm paying two tuitions.
I employ a nanny. The kids see therapists to deal with the tragedy.
I plan trips to broaden their horizons...
... and it's like a root canal when I need reimbursement.
-Where'd you get it? -You faxed it to us last week.
I'm surprised to hear you have both children at Westcott.
Did I say Westcott? We changed our minds about it. It's too glitzy.
-We gotta do what's best for them. -Isn't that the truth?
Thank you for waiting. I'll take your order.
I need five dozen 10cc syringes fentanyl...
...and I need two dozen 20cc syringes Demerol.
We sent up 60 of fentanyl on Monday.
I doubled the PCA infusion rate of Demerol in six patients.
Dr. Glass?
I'm on the phone with the pharmacy.
Dr. Wise wants to see you.
The Medical Director.
Wake up, Ruby.
Sleeping Beauty.
All you do is sleep. It scares me.
So you're losing your medical license. That's wonderful.
-I have a sickness. -Yeah, it's called self-pity.
Complicated by being born without a freaking backbone.
So I'm weak, am I?
Maybe I am.
At least I'm not greedy and reckless...
...borrowing a million from loan sharks--
Which should've been paid off! We had a good thing going...
...till you put your hand in.
A good thing? You son of a bitch!
-I was a doctor! -Yeah, but you became a junkie.
Not until you did what you did.
Where were you when I did it?
Right. I saw an opportunity, Erin.
I saw an opportunity and grabbed it.
I had what you didn't. I had the nerve, the will.
Since nobody gave me a chance, I took it.
I'm not doing this anymore.
It's already done.
This is about containing the damage. Understand?
Good.
You know we have to get rid of the girl.
Speaking of which, we're dry?
There's nothing to take care of her, so I'll get something.
If I can't find drugs in L.A....
Hi!
Wave at the camera, Ruby. Wave at the camera!
They can't catch me!
-Come in the water, Erin! -Wait! I'm coming too!
Spin me, Erin! Faster! -Good girl.
Rhett. Rhett, move away.
Erin! It took some doing...
...but I found some pharmaceutical morphine.
Erin?
God, not now.
Erin?
1875 Montego Canyon.
I thought you'd wanna know.
Ruby?
Honey?
Terry needs to talk to you kids.
You kids are a handful, you know that?
Where's your sister? Where's your damn sister?
I should've put you here from day one.
What's happening?
He got the Jag.
-He walked back in the house. -Keep working.
He's sleeping.
He fell asleep. There's gonna be a change of plans.
Why would he do that?
He's bombed!
He finished a bottle of vodka. It's right there.
I see what's weird.
Begleiter! What's going on?
You ought to have your wife take a look at that.
-She's not home. -Your office said you were home.
I kept calling but nobody answered, so here I am.
The bank blocked your guardianship account.
The officer believes there's malfeasance.
The sons of bitches!
I went out on a limb for you.
I warned you about the girl's claims...
I warned you about the girl's claims... ...about her accusations, because I trusted you, as did the Bakers.
...about her accusations, because I trusted you, as did the Bakers.
But if you've lied, the courts will step in.
If they take these children, they have no place to go.
He thought he was helping us.
Mr. Glass, where are the children?
At their music lessons. Their piano lessons.
Next, I'll have to buy them a Steinway...
...and the bank will say, "Can't they play the kazoo?"
Shit!
That's my Testarossa.
No, that's our Testarossa. Until we get our money back.
You planned to skip town today?
You planned to skip town today? Where'd you get that idea?
Where'd you get that idea? -Your wife called us this morning. -My wife?
-Your wife called us this morning. -My wife?
Before you leave, how about repay the loan in one lump cash sum.
He doesn't have our money.
-What's going on, Terry? -Ask him.
-Your partner? -Bastard robbed me blind.
-Oh, my God. I'm leaving. -No, no, no.
-You're not. -Really?
-We need an explanation. -From me?
I have nothing to do with this!
-Nobody listens anymore. -Are you happy, Terry?
Feel good about that? Terry, you're a troublemaker.
-That took care of the problem. -No. We'll discuss this in the car.
There's nothing to discuss!
Just walk like a man out to the Jag.
That was the problem. You solved it.
The rest is pure profit.
Not the Jag. The Volvo.
Wait here for a minute, okay?
-Nice little drive in our car. -No! Not in there!
Not in there! No! Not in there!
I don't even have the key!
We got all the keys to all the cars.
Take the Volvo, not the Jag!
-Let's go! -Okay, you win!
-You win. -It's over.
Just please take the Volvo, okay?
You're making this difficult.
-Whatever. -Take the Volvo.
Brand loyalty. I like that.
That little bitch!
You're some kind of joker. We'll take the Jaguar.
You're some kind of joker. We'll take the Jaguar. No!
You haven't been to our Tarzana office.
We got a handball court and a sauna...
...and way in the back we have this special room.
Totally soundproof.
What the--?
What the--?
What'd you do to this car?! What'd you do to this car?!
Hi, you guys need some help?
Yes.
-Everything under control? -We got it covered.
Terry.
You two kids stay in the car.
I have a possible T.C. Southbound, Malibu Canyon.
-I'll be investigating. -Copy that.
I have a rollover T.C... ...with one fatality. I'll need two backup units.
...with one fatality. I'll need two backup units.
Ruby.
It's okay.
Ruby, go! Drive!
-Where's the stupid key?! -It's okay!
We're gonna die here! Let's go! Come on, find them!
Ruby!
I need your help.
-He's getting closer! -I got them!
He's getting closer!
Drive! Drive! Drive!
Why are you stopping?!
It's okay, honey.
-Buckle up. -What're you doing?!
-All's forgiven. -What're you doing?
You kids okay? Go back and wait by my car.
Things will get easier from here on.
-No. -No.
Let's go over this shit one more time.
Look, they got a small dinger on the entrance door here, right? I'm gonna get them to open it. Then me and Levine are going in, right?
I'm gonna get them to open it. Then me and Levine are going in, right?
Giolito and Pederson, you go over here to this overhead door here and you block it, right?
Okay? Now, Rondell and Leppert, you'll hit the back door.
No problem. It's a piece of cake.
McKee and Cline, you're gonna be in the yard, in case we get some jump-outs. Y'all catch somebody
-trying to jump out of the window… -Foley. Excuse me a second.
Where in the hell is SWAT?
-Uh, boss, I cancelled the SWAT team. -You what?
I wouldn't raid a church bingo game without SWAT.
These guys are carjackers. They're not Equalizer, right? They're mechanics. I think we can handle this.
They're mechanics. I think we can handle this. We don't need SWAT coming here and blowing holes in all my evidence.
Besides, they might, you know, shoot somebody or something. So, let's do this.
This is your operation. I'm just an observer. But I'll be watching.
Just observe how I don't have to use SWAT, and trust me on this one, okay?
Everybody's ready here, okay, right? Nobody need to take a nervous piss or nothing, right?
We got this, okay?
Let's mount up.
[Dick] This is Dick Purtan. We've got 55 degrees outside this morning.
Now here's Motown's own Diana Ross from The Supremes, "Come See About Me."
Hey, hey! -[car horn honks] -Come on. What are you doing?
Bobby, they're here.
Any trouble with the hijack?
-Right where you say it is. -Piece of cake, man.
-Anybody hurt? -No.
Good. I don't like to see people unnecessarily injured.
Nobody got hurt, bud.
-Keys? -Ain't your truck yet, man. Not till we see some money.
I just want to look in the back.
Yes!
-♪ I've given up my friends just ♪ -♪ For you ♪ -♪ My friends are gone and you have too ♪ -♪ Have too ♪
Where's our money? Pay him.
♪ I'm gonna love you anyway ♪
Hey, hey!
Man, you think we should have used SWAT?
-Fuck SWAT. -That's what I say. Fuck SWAT.
-[knocking on door] -Some guy. What should I do? Kill him.
Oh, how you doing? Is this the illegal chop shop? One of them illegal places where they chop up cars?
'Cause I got a Buick out here, belong to my wife. I want to get this shit chopped up, 'cause the bitch ain't been acting right.
Know what I mean? Can you come out, take a look at it for me, please?
Go, go, go!
Go!
They got fucking machine guns.
I thought you said they had no guns!
They must've changed their worldview.
Get the 12-gauge.
We should've called SWAT.
[inspector] Police! Hands in the air!
-[both groan] -[Leppert] Shit!
-Move it! Go! -[Rondell] Go!
-[tense music playing] -What the…
[Orrin] Daniel, come on!
Y'all cover me. I'm going in with Todd.
No!
Axel, you on a coffee break?
Go get that son of a bitch.
Hey, boss. Hey, man! Hey! Shit!
We got a tail.
Wax that clown.
[Axel] Goddamn it!
Help me, man.
Police officer! I'm trying to catch a goddamn killer! Move it! Move it!
Get the fuck out of my way! I'm a cop! Take it easy.
Man, get the fuck out of here, all right?
Thank you. My name's Steve Fulbright. Could I see some ID, please?
Hey, man, I am a Detroit police officer. My name is Axel-- Where's my shit?
Nuh-uh. Uh-huh. I'm a Detroit police officer. I am chasing a killer. A killer who's getting away now.
-Okay? -We know. You know what?
We know.
What's happened here, Detective Foley, is you got yourself in the middle of a federal investigation.
What is this, income tax?
The fucking guy in the truck just shot a Detroit police officer!
And it's very important he not be apprehended at this time.
We want to know where he's going, with what he's got and who he's selling it to.
It's drugs? We're not DEA.
We appreciate your cooperation on this.
I checked with Washington, this guy Fulbright is kosher.
I mean, he's working on something so classified they got the ladder up behind him.
Hey, Axel, if the federal government want these guys running loose,
shouldn't we close down the investigation?
Fuck the federal government. I want the man that killed Todd. Now, what you got?
Not a hell of a lot. Plates on the van were phony. The dead mechanics were executed.
Only one was strapped, it was still holstered.
Plus, the bodies of the two shooters had 30,000 in cash.
-That's high-priced heat. -Only ID on both these shooters
-That's high-priced heat. -Only ID on both these shooters were San Diego drivers' licenses. San Diego PD's got a sheet on these guys.
were San Diego drivers' licenses. San Diego PD's got a sheet on these guys. Enforcers for hire, mostly for the Tijuana drug dealers.
Enforcers for hire, mostly for the Tijuana drug dealers.
You think this is about drugs?
An attaché case, which may belong to one of the shooters,
had a towel in it from the Wonder World Hotel, in California.
Wonder World? Did you check out that car they shot Todd from?
Yeah, rental from the airport. The renter's a Dr. Oliver Hirsch from Oklahoma City.
The renter's a Dr. Oliver Hirsch from Oklahoma City.
-A stolen ID? -Yeah.
Doctor said his wallet was lifted while he was on vacation
in an amusement park.
I hope you're gonna tell me the amusement park was Wonder World. Yeah.
Okay. Excuse me. -Wonder World. -Wonder World.
I understand that you were with him at the end.
Yeah. His last words were about you.
That does not sound like my Douglas, Axel. Try again.
[chuckles] Actually, his last words were,
"Axel, are you on a coffee break? Go and get that son of a bitch."
Those were his last words.
That sounds like my Douglas. Yeah. It sounds like a good idea too.
-[automated voice] Hello! -Hello, my name is Axel Foley. I'm looking for Billy Rosewood.
[automated voice] Welcome to the Beverly Hills Police Department.
To continue this message in English, press one pound.
For Spanish, press two star. For Farsi, press three pound.
If you have homeless people on your lawn, -press 15. -[chuckles]
[automated voice] If you need the riot rumor hotline, press 17.
Hey! Which button for Billy Rosewood?
Monsieur C'est Beau? Rosewood? In the house?
Le Rose-- Moi-- Le Rosewood!
Come in.
It's open.
-[chuckles] -[Billy] Axel Foley! Billy, how you doing, man?
-I don't believe it. -Look at your office! Look at this!
You got three windows in here, Venetian blinds, and a ficus.
One of them big, healthy ficus in your office.
[Billy chuckles] Not just the ficus. Look.
You got a refrigerator in your office?
Man, J. Edgar Hoover didn't even have a refrigerator in his office.
Just maybe some hair curlers and a dryer or something. [chuckles]
What, they promote you to captain or something? I'm DDOJSIOC.
The JG-Joe-Joe-C? What is that?
It stands for Deputy Director of Operations
for Joint Systems Interdepartmental Operational Command.
Okay.
[chuckles] Here we are. -[sirens wailing in distance] -Los Angeles.
One of the greatest cities in the world, Axel,
divided, divided by its unique geography.
Geography? L.A. is a vast metropolis
with social and economic imbalances spread over an enormous distance.
A criminal hits here, Beverly Hills, then here, West Hollywood, then here, downtown.
Whose responsibility is it? Everybody's?
Impossible. So it all comes here. Every crime that crosses the green line.
The green line? Green lines of jurisdiction.
Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Downtown, The Valley, Santa Monica.
Peace officers respect these green lines, Axel, but the criminal doesn't.
So whenever a criminal crosses between green lines, that’s when the DDOJSIOC goes to work.
That's very impressive, Billy.
I control the green lines, and Axel,
whoever controls the green lines, controls Southern California.
-You wanted to see me, Billy? -[radio chatter]
Oh, yes, I did, Jon. The sheriff's department
nabbed two guys pulling a stall-and-hook in a mall parking line.
It's the same MO as those jobs on Melrose last week.
Beautiful. I'll run out there and talk to them.
They're holding 'em in Van Nuys. -I'll call and tell them you're coming. -Good. All right.
-I'll call and tell them you're coming. -Good. All right.
Jon, I want you to meet a friend of mine. Axel Foley.
Jon, I want you to meet a friend of mine. Axel Foley. Axel, Jon Flint.
How are you? Yeah, I've heard about you. You're from Detroit, right?
Taggart used to talk about you. Hey, Taggart! Where is he? I'd love to say hello to him.
Hey, Taggart! Where is he? I'd love to say hello to him.
Then you'll have to fly to Phoenix. Taggart's retired.
Spends his days lost in the woods looking for his golf balls.
[chuckles] That's a dream I'm not too far from myself.
So, what brings you to California, Axel? Vacation?
I'm looking for a killer. In Beverly Hills?
No. Wonder World. Wo… Wonder World? You mean Rufus Rabbit has gone berserko? [chuckles]
Wo… Wonder World? You mean Rufus Rabbit has gone berserko? [chuckles]
No. My boss got gunned down in a chop shop.
The killer got away in a cream-colored Ford truck
-and I think it might be out here. -Plates?
Plates were phony. But we've got some evidence that points to Wonder World.
So what I wanna do is go down to Wonder World, look around and ask some questions. Maybe I can find something out.
look around and ask some questions. Maybe I can find something out. Would y'all know somebody down there?
Absolutely. Ellis DeWald, he's the head of park security.
Runs the biggest private security force in America.
Can you introduce me to him? As soon as I have a talk with the perps in Van Nuys, all right?
You go on out. I'll call DeWald, tell him you're coming.
He's a great guy, he's a pal of mine. I'll meet you out there.
Great. Thanks.
You'll love Wonder World, it's a great place. [chuckles softly]
And Axel, don't forget, we play by the rules around here.
Yeah. I've heard Taggart's stories.
Hey, which one of those green lines is Wonder World behind?
Hello, sir. Welcome to Wonder World. Can I help you?
Uh, yes, I'd like to talk to one of the park executives, a Mr. Ellis DeWald.
-Do you have an appointment? -I'm supposed to. My name is Axel Foley.
Okay. I'm sorry, sir. I don't have you on the list.
Maybe they haven't called yet.
A Detective Flint from the Beverly Hills Police Department
was supposed to call and get me squared away.
I'm sorry, sir, but if you don't have an appointment for park business,
you will have to buy a ticket.
-How much is a ticket? -Thirty-five dollars.
Thirty-five dollars?
That allows you and your party access to all the rides, shows and attractions.
Wait a minute. Look, I… [chuckles] I don't want to go on any rides, okay, and I don't have any party. It's just me.
I don't want to go on any rides, okay, and I don't have any party. It's just me.
And all I wanna do is talk to the director of security.
Excuse me, sir, would you step out of line for a moment, please?
-What line? -Just step over here, please, sir.
Thank you.
Is there a problem, sir? Yeah, I'll tell you what the problem is. Thirty-five dollars, that's what the problem is.
Well, if the admission seems high, we suggest you go down the road
to Fantasy Park.
You might find their ticket price more to your liking, sir.
The point is, I'm here to see Ellis DeWald, all right. Is he your boss?
Yes. Mr. DeWald is head of security and guest relations.
Do you have an appointment? -I'm supposed to have an appointment. -[chuckles]
Supposed to is not having, is it, sir?
Excuse me.
One, please. There you go. -Thank you. -Thank you.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
You know, you… you should have your tailor cut the jacket a little wider at the chest.
That way your gun won't bulge in the back.
Thank you.
[chuckles] Uncle Dave.
What's going on?
"Alien Attack"?
Can I help you?
Oh, I was just curious what Alien Attack is.
Watch.
-[alarm blaring] -[announcer] Attention! Attention! This is a red alert. Alien spacecraft are invading the city.
Board the subway trains for immediate evacuation.
This is wild.
[chuckles] Yes. It's one of our more popular attractions.
Excuse me, but, um, what are you doing in here?
You're right. I gotta go. I have a meeting. But, uh, thanks for the show.
Punch up tunnel nine. Take a look.
What do you wanna do? [man] I'll send Cooper. Get him.
[Axel] Excuse me.
-Hey! -That's not fair.
-Hey! -That's not fair. Maintenance. I gotta go grease a chain.
Hear how dry it sounds? Sorry.
Come on. Let's go.
-Hi, Mom! -Look! Up here!
Hi, Mommy! I'm here! Look, over here! Over here!
-Bring that man down. -I can't until it goes all--
-I said bring him down, goddamn it. -What are you-- Don't, don't. No.
Don't. Don't. Don't! Jesus!
-Uh-oh. -What the hell? -What's going on? -What's going on?
Code red on the Spider.
Wonder World? Axel!
-Help! -Help!
Help! Please!
Shit!
Oh, my God. Look!
-Are you all right? -Yeah, I'm okay, just don't let go.
[security officer] All units in the vicinity of Wonder World,
proceed immediately to assist in emergency rescue.
Axel!
You see this rope? We're gonna try to slide down this rope all the way to the ground.
We are? We're gonna try.
Give me your hand. I want you to come up and hold on to my neck.
Come on. It's okay.
You gonna grab onto my neck really tight, okay?
Come on. Come on. Hold on really tight.
Hold on tight. [gags] Not too tight!
[Axel] Give me your hand.
Come on. Stop that. None of that. Give me your hand. It's okay. Come on. It's okay.
Come on.
Hang on! Hang on tight!
Come on. Come on up.
Our head of security has confirmed your identity with the Detroit police.
But neither they nor I…
[chuckles] …understand what you're doing at Wonder World.
I told you I was investigating a crime. I think I'm in the right place,
'cause I've been here for ten minutes, and I've already been shot at.
Oh, yes. Some of our guest relations people, you said.
Miss Perkins is here with the surveillance tapes.
Send her right in.
This starts in the Spider maintenance tunnel.
There I am, coming down the tunnel.
What is that? Tracking fuzz. The monitors are all on a loop.
I don't see any gunman, Mr. Foley.
Who the fuck do you think I was shooting at?
You better start thinking about a lawyer, Foley. The tapes don't show your gunman.
They don't show something else, Mr. Sanderson.
They don't show Mr. Foley's courage when the ride malfunctioned.
He risked his life to save two children.
Yeah, they don't show that shit.
Well, that would be very impressive, if we knew for sure
you didn't cause the malfunction in the first place.
Mr. DeWald. Send him in.
Mr. Foley, Mr. DeWald.
You fuck! Motherfucker… That's him!
Motherfucker! That's the fucking guy I'm looking for!
Orrin, you want to tell me what's going on here?
This fucking guy shot a Detroit police officer last weekend!
Last weekend? I was at my beach house in Laguna last weekend.
Your beach home in Laguna?
Wait, wait. Hold on. I think I got the wrong guy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This is a big-- I'm cool. This is a big misunderstanding.
I didn't know you were at your beach…
Fuck! Beach house in Laguna! You motherfucker!
Miss Bruce, call the police. [Miss Bruce] They just walked in.
Axel! That's the guy! That's the killer!
Ellis DeWald?
-[thudding] -Axel!
We really appreciate this, Ellis.
Your friend is lucky Mr. Sanderson doesn't want any publicity.
You just keep him and his delusions out of my face and out of my park.
No problem, Ellis. You got it, baby. Oh, by the way, uh, are we still on for, uh, for Sunday, huh?
Bring your money, sucker.
[laughs] All right. When you have a little more time, I'd like to--
Not right now. Later, perhaps.
[waitress] Thanks.
Here we go.
Thank you.
And the usual for you, Billy.
Thanks a lot. Look, isn't it just possible that you're mistaken, Foley?
That Ellis DeWald just resembles Todd's killer?
I made the guy in Detroit. It was DeWald.
DeWald is the head of the largest private police department in Southern California.
I mean, he works with us, with the LAPD. Hell, with the governor's office.
Everybody loves him.
He's even getting an award tonight
from the National Association of Security Agencies.
Axel, it's understandable that you're distraught
and looking for justice, not to mention revenge.
But isn't it just possible that you… that you want it so much
that you saw your killer in a man who bore a slight resemblance?
Hell, we run into this all the time in police work, Axel.
Where is DeWald getting that award tonight? Axel, don't!
Hey, Flint, your friend DeWald is foul, okay? I know he's foul and I'm going down to this awards show tonight,
I know he's foul and I'm going down to this awards show tonight,
and I'm gonna put some pressure on him.
And maybe I panic him into doing something stupid.
Axel, if you go to that dinner tonight, I'm going with you.
Pick me up at the Sunset Motel.
Freeze, motherfucker!
Detective Foley? You're Uncle Dave! [laughs] Hey!
Hey, Uncle-- Oh, my God! I almost shot Uncle Dave!
I'm so embarrassed. I'm sorry. Hey, nice to meet you! Uncle Dave!
The front desk let us in to wait, Mr. Foley. I hope you don't mind.
No, it's fine. -It's Uncle Dave! Uncle Dave! -[both chuckle]
-Uncle Dave! Uncle Dave! Hey! -Thank you. -[Axel] Have a seat, please. -[Uncle Dave] Thank you.
-[Axel] Have a seat, please. -[Uncle Dave] Thank you. -I was such a fan of yours. -Oh, thank you, son.
-I was such a fan of yours. -Oh, thank you, son. -[laughs] Uncle Dave… -[Uncle Dave chuckles]
You're very kind. Um, Detective Foley, what's going on at my park?
You think there's something going on? I have no doubts.
What? I have no doubts… nor do I have any ideas.
Exactly two weeks ago, Detective Foley,
Roger Fry, the park's chief operating officer
and my friend, disappeared.
Roger Fry designed the park, every nook and cranny of it,
Roger Fry designed the park, every nook and cranny of it, from the landscaping to the concession stands.
What do you mean he just disappeared? Show him the note.
I received this interoffice the day Roger disappeared.
"This is important. Life and death. Roger"
What was so important? I don't know.
What was he doing the day he disappeared?
It was nothing special. He was probably doing one of his usual inspections.
You say this guy designed the whole park? Yes.
And he knew the place cold, right? Of course.
So, what are you thinking?
I'm thinking that he must've found something that someone didn't want him to find.
At Wonder World? What on earth could that be?
It's a place of childhood innocence and fun.
And life and death.
-You met Uncle Dave? -Yes.
Uncle Dave.
[scoffs] I don't believe it. I'd give anything to have been with you. Did he do the Oki-Doki Shuffle?
I'd give anything to have been with you. Did he do the Oki-Doki Shuffle? -[laughs] -No. [chuckles]
Outstanding.
Hi. William Rosewood with DDOJSIOC. I beg your pardon?
This is me. Thank you.
[chuckles softly] Now what you gonna do with this shit?
No way. I don't believe this! Ackwell!
Ackwell Folee! Ackwell Folee, you crazy thing. What you doing here?
-"Surge." -Serge.
-"Serge." -Serge.
-Look at your head! I love it short! -Yeah…
-Yeah, Surge. -[Serge] Turn around. -[stuttering] Would you like-- [chuckles] -[Serge] Turn around.
I don't believe how perfect you look! And then finally, you have black Hush Puppies,
which are totally retro, which I love. You… you put a really good package together.
You remember Billy Rosewood. Billy! Billy, I remember you.
-Do you remember? -Of course.
I made you an espresso at the art gallery with a lemon twist?
It was the last one I ever made.
It's terrible to drink espresso. You know why?
It stain your teeth. It makes-- I'm not gonna show you mine,
but let me see your teeth.
They're so pretty. Can I see your teeth?
Look, and you got healthy gums.
-Do you do colonics? -Excuse me?
-[Serge] Do you do colonics? -Coloni-- No. Never--
-It's my new favorite thing! -Oh, you dig the colonics?
Oh, I can't tell you what it's like
-because they stick a hose up inside… -I know--
No, but you've got to understand.
Out comes a candy bar from when you were five!
What happened to your art gallery that you had? The art gallery is completely bankrupt. In the toilet. Why?
The art gallery is completely bankrupt. In the toilet. Why?
Because we had an owner who was obstinate and stupid and ignorant.
-You shot him, remember? You remember him? -Oh, yes. I shot him.
-What are you doing now? -I'm doing guns! Come and look. Come and look.
This is my booth and it's the Survival Boutique.
We are doing weapons and protective devices and products for survival
in the helter-skelter world of today.
Okay. Now, one thing's very important. At the Survival Boutique,
I feel that it's my personality, my philosophy, that everything must conform
to the three P's, okay?
Which is protection, prestige and pretty.
I mean, why you should look ugly if you're just trying to survive?
You should be able to maintain your personal sense of style
and be safe as well. Okay, what do you think this is?
and be safe as well. Okay, what do you think this is? It looks like a key chain, but it's so much more.
It looks like a key chain, but it's so much more.
This is called a stunner. It is designed by an ex-Navy SEAL, okay?
Very serious individual, I never see him smile.
Also I never see him in a pair of pants that fit.
Someone comes up to you who is a carjacker.
Do you want to die for your Camry? I don't think so, right?
[clicks tongue] So, you say-- A little bit of deception,
"I want to separate the house keys from my car keys, okay?"
"I'm just gonna push this button, okay?" And he says, "Okay."
And then you push this button, and out it comes from the mechanism,
the brightest blinding light ever that you've seen.
He cannot see. He's… like this.
Everyone's come running to help you.
And once again, you have survived with style.
Wow. That's cool.
Billy, I want to give you one for a present, okay?
Thank you.
And Ackwell, I want to give you one because I worry about you.
I want you to be safe. Thanks.
Now, I'm going to show you something that is going to totally blow your rocks off.
It's absolutely orgasmic, and my most thing that I'm proud of.
It's the most up-to-date, the ultimate survival tool for today.

Now, who the hell is gonna buy that shit?
Are you joking? This is L.A. I'm selling hundreds of these.
It's on back order.
-[in high-pitch] Get the fuck outta here! -[in high-pitch] No, I cannot
because I am trying to tell you… [in normal voice] …I sell ten of these to Jackie Stallone for stocking stuffers.

Get the fuck outta here. Sly came in and bought 14.
-Zsa Zsa Gabor has one. Eva has one-- -[audience applauding]
-We gotta go. Thanks, Surge. -Thanks.
Ackwell, try to say "Serge." It's not so difficult.
"Surge" sounds like a detergent.
What are you gonna do, Axel?
I'm not gonna do nothing. I just wanna hear the man speak.
To keep a park like Wonder World a safe, wholesome, family environment
a safe, wholesome, family environment
in difficult times like these is an enormous challenge.
But my friend Ellis DeWald has done just that.
Couple that with Ellis's work with underprivileged kids…
some of whom are seated at the head table right now with Ellis.
And you can understand why he's our award winner.
So let's bring him up here. Ladies and gentlemen, the head of security at Wonder World
Ladies and gentlemen, the head of security at Wonder World and private law enforcement's Man of the Year award winner,
and private law enforcement's Man of the Year award winner, my dear friend, Ellis DeWald.
-Congratulations. You deserve it. -Thank you, Orrin.
-Congratulations. -Thanks, Mike.
You're not gonna do nothing, Axel. You never do nothing.
[Ellis] Thank you very much.
You know, a lot of nice things happen when you work at a nice place like Wonder World,
especially when your bosses are people like Orrin Sanderson
and Uncle Dave Thornton. And I don't think that Uncle Dave would mind
if I said that this is the nicest thing yet.
Thank you very much.
Please don't do this, Axel. Please don't do it.
-Bravo! -Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.
[Axel] Bravo, Ellis DeWald! Ellis DeWald!
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo, Ellis!
Ellis DeWald, ladies and gentlemen!
Ellis DeWald! Y'all keep it going!
Keep it going for Ellis DeWald! Come on, it's Ellis! Ellis DeWald, y'all!
You're not clapping loud enough! This is Ellis DeWald!
It's this man's night! Yes!
Ladies and gentlemen, I've traveled all the way from Detroit, Michigan,
to be with this man tonight, to honor this man tonight.
My name is Axel Foley. I'm a Detroit police officer
and it is a tremendous surprise for Mr. DeWald to have me standing right next to him right now.
for Mr. DeWald to have me standing right next to him right now.
You know, right now I can feel his body tingling!
But, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to know that there's not a night that goes by
that I don't think about what I owe Ellis DeWald.
And there's not a night that passes that I don't think about
what the people of Detroit owe Ellis DeWald.
And I'd just like to say, when I sit here, and I see y'all give him this award for, uh…
What's this here? Oh, that's beautiful.
"With gratitude for community service."
And I'm going to do the community a service
because I'm going to pay back Ellis DeWald
everything we owe him with interest!
-[audience cheers, applauds] -Ellis DeWald! Ellis DeWald!
Go on, smile. Let's get them last few smiles in.
What's the matter, Foley? You mad at me for shooting your boyfriend?
[security] I got him! I got him! I got him! I got him!
You and Billy disturbing the peace? No! [laughs]
Do me a favor. Just make your fucking phone call
and get us out of here, all right?
Sure. Sure. Sure. Let's see. Now who do I know down there? Let's see.
Hey, don't fuck with me right now.
All right. Keep your shirt on. I'll get you guys out.
Oh, incidentally, I think we found that truck you were looking for.
-Where? -By the Santa Monica pier at the beach.
I'm headed out there now. I'll pick you guys up on the way.
Oh, and Axel, in the meantime, don't take any showers.
[sighs] I'm all washed-up. Dead in the water.
You stop worrying. I talked to Flint, he's going to get us out of here.
-I really liked that office. -[door lock rattling]
[officer] Foley! You're out of here. Oh, that was quick.
Not him, just you.
[Steve] Come in.
Thank you, officer.
I ran a check on you, Foley.
You're a hell of a detective, but something of a maverick.
[inhales sharply] I know what you're doing. I know the drill.
You hassle DeWald… [sighs] …you get him to panic, make a rash move.
But Goddamn it, Foley, we do not want to panic this man.
We want him doing business as fucking usual.
Do you copy me, Foley?
Ticket to Detroit. First class. Courtesy of the Federal Government.
Also, my card.
Should you have any more thoughts about DeWald, let us handle it.
I give you my word as a gentleman I'll be on that plane.
Truck was spotted by an LAPD traffic control officer in Santa Monica.
It's a different color, but the same make and model as yours.
Read you, Lima, Charlie. Out. Beach Leader, over?
Negatory, SWAT, hold for our arrival.
ETA, 11 minutes. Out.
Billy, who were you just talking to?
A truck was discovered inside the county green line,
so I coordinated with the SMPD, BHPD,
LAPD, sheriff of Los Angeles County, supervisors of Parks and Recreation,
California State Highway Patrol, and the district attorney's office, the United States Naval Shore Patrol.
and the district attorney's office, the United States Naval Shore Patrol.
Beach Leader to Team One. Proceed.
All teams standing ready.
Go! Go! Go!
Area secured.
The lab says these are the same fibers as the truck upholstery.
No help there. There's some beach sand, probably blew in after it was abandoned.
I just had a very unpleasant conversation with my superiors.
What, about being busted? No.
There was some objection to my use of manpower on Operation Truck Siege.
What is it? You got a $50 bill?
I've got a wife and three kids. I haven't seen a 50 in 12 years.
Billy, you got a $50 bill? When do I get it back?
Man, give me $50!
[sighs] It's all I got.
This is a corner of a $50 bill like Billy's new one with the hidden barcode.
So the corner tore off a bill. It happens all the time.
No, the barcode's going up and down, which means it comes off this corner of the bill
which means it comes off this corner of the bill
If it comes off this corner and it should have some ink on it.
This doesn't. This is too big to be blank.
Look! It's Oki-Doki!
Grab your brother! And don't let him get away. I got to load my camera.
[boy] Oki-Doki!
[Axel] Hey, nice little kid. How you doing? Nice little boy.
Good to see you.
I love you, Oki-Doki! Hey, Oki, do the Oki Shuffle.
[Axel] Oki-Doki, Oki-Doki, Doki, Doki-Oki!
That's not right! It's like this.
[Axel] Listen, kid, I'm Oki-Doki and I changed the steps.
You got a problem with that?
You're supposed to be nice to me no matter what I do!
[Axel groans] You little motherfucker, I'll kick your ass.
[Axel] Yeah?
Grandma! Grandma! Oki-Doki pushed me!
[man 1] You take it already.
Come on, Sheldon. You playing or what?
[man 2] Oh, wait a minute. Who the hell ate garlic?
[man 1] Yeah, when's lunch? I want a pastrami sandwich on rye.
Hey, you guys see that new Rufus Rabbit? -[man 3] There's a woman in there? -[man 1] I'm telling you. Come on.
-[man 3] There's a woman in there? -[man 1] I'm telling you. Come on.
-Axel? -[Oki-Doki] What?
Coffee. Would you like some coffee?
[Oki-Doki] Hey, Louis, how's it going?
-[Axel] Fine, fine. -[Oki-Doki] Hey, say hi to Irene for me.
[Axel] Will do. Louis?
Follow me.
[man 1] Uh-oh. I wouldn't mind giving her a little massage.
When DeWald took over, he, um, stuck me down here
on what he calls park safety watch.
He thinks he took me out of the loop, but as long as I have a computer,
I can still access most of what's in the, uh, mainframe.
-Okay. Is this the tunnel system? -Yes.
Do any of these tunnels lead to, like, a place
where it's, like, limited access and only DeWald's boys can go there?
No. All park accesses are unrestricted to park personnel.
Well, except for the Happy Forest. That's closed while it's being redone.
Show me the Happy Forest.
Oh, that would be right… here at the end of corridor B.
-[soft music playing] -It's right after, uh…
It's right after, um…
How long's it been closed? Too long.
I'm talking about the Happy Forest ride?
-Oh. [chuckles] -[chuckles] -The Forest? -The Happy Forest, yeah. Yes, about a couple of weeks.
It wasn't a very popular ride,
so they're trying to come up with some new ideas.
Well, I think they found a new idea. Can I have this piece of thing here? Can you rip that off for me?
-Sure. -Thanks.
There you go.
You know, uh… when this thing is over-- Uh-huh?
What do-- Would you like to get together and have some dinner or something?
-[chuckles] That would be nice. -Yeah. -Can you put that down in here for me? -Sure.
-Can you put that down in here for me? -Sure. -Okay, like that. Thank you. -There you go.
-Okay. So we have a date? -A date.
All right. Can you help me put this thing on?
-Sure. Ooh. -[Axel grunts]
[Janice] There you go.
Okay. Remember, an elephant never forgets. -All right. [chuckles] -[music fades out]
-[Axel] Hey, Louis, how goes it? -[Louis] Fine. Nice to see you.
-[Axel] Say hello to Irene. -[Louis] You bet. See you around.
-[Ellis] Everything on schedule? -[man 1] Yeah.
I had to tweak the image a little bit, a bleeding problem,
I had to tweak the image a little bit, a bleeding problem, but it's under control now.
[Ellis whispers] Foley's upstairs.
Get him!
[announcer] Will the DeWald family please come to Tiny Town?
The DeWald family to Tiny Town.
But, honey, the Happy Forest is closed.
Uh-- Okay, I'll meet you at the main gate after five o'clock. Okay.
-Oh, oh, I'm sorry. -You're sorry?
Hi. This is Detective Axel Foley. I'd like to speak with Agent Fulbright, please.
Could you patch me into his radio? It's an emergency.
Fulbright, Foley.
Hey, listen, man, I found what you're looking for.
Yeah, I'm at Wonder World.
Fuck, man, get out here now!
Get me 9-1-1.
[Janice] Attention, all cars in the vicinity of Wonder World.
Proceed there immediately. We have a 10-19, 10-45 and 12-22 in progress.
Why am I not surprised?
[woman] There you go.
All right, don't shoot! Don't shoot, I'll put my gun down.
I put my gun on the ground, and I'm unarmed.
Don't shoot.
This is great.
You caught him. Good. He broke into a security area.
Hey, relax. Why don't you save that shit for new talent night at San Quentin.
I'm on to your operation. My operation?
Goddamn it, Axel, what have you done now?
He went berserk. He was firing a weapon in the park.
My God, there are hundreds of small, innocent children around.
You know they don't give out Oscars in prison, right? Fuck you!
Mr. Sanderson, there's someone here from--
Fulbright, Secret Service.
Foley.
I thought I put you on a plane to Detroit.
Look, you're gonna be really glad that I stayed 'cause, like I said,
I know what you're investigating. What you're looking for is right here.
Yeah? And what am I investigating? Paper, US Mint quality.
That's what was in that hijacked truck back in Detroit.
You wanted to follow the truck back to L.A. so you could track DeWald, find out where his fucking print shop is.
so you could track DeWald, find out where his fucking print shop is.
Well, it's right here in Wonder World. What on Earth is this maniac raving about?
He's insane! He's proved that. In Wonder World?
Man, this place is as high-tech as NASA and Nintendo combined. Look.
They got a hidden room under this closed ride
and they do all this shit in there. And I was in there.
That's why they were chasing me.
My men were pursuing Mr. Foley
because he's obviously delusionary and potentially dangerous.
This hidden room, delusionary also?
No. There is a closed ride, which we use to--
I'd better take a look at it. Yes. Maybe we'd better take look at it.
Right here. Counterfeit bills, right out of this machine.
Is this true? Afraid so, Officer.
Afraid we've been caught red-handed, right, Ellis?
Afraid so.
Would you like to see them? They're first quality. Uh, make a run, Donald.
We're calling them Wonder World dollars.
Redeemable for admission, rides, souvenirs.
It's our big Christmas promotion.
We're giving it away to elementary schools all across the country.
You must be in on this shit. Is that what it is?
You supply the equipment, he supplies the paper, right?
They changed the visual matrix from the real money to this shit the minute that I left,
from the real money to this shit the minute that I left, and as soon as we leave, they'll put it back.
and as soon as we leave, they'll put it back. What's this paper?
-Ordinary rag. -Well, then they switched it.
I am tired of these accusations, officers.
I want this man arrested for public endangerment.
Could I speak with you a moment?
Goddamn it, Foley! We spent a whole fucking year with our noses up DeWald's ass!
We spent a whole fucking year with our noses up DeWald's ass!
We're this close to locking this thing up, and you… You piss all over us?
Our case is blown.
You're going back to Detroit. And I'll tell you something else. If you weren't a cop,
I'd have you doing dead time in Leavenworth for life.
Detective Flint, he's yours.
Let's go, Axel.
Make sure he doesn't get on the plane.
God Damn it, Axel! I got a wife, three kids, a mortgage
and a pension that won't cut it.
I need that job at Wonder World. It is my retirement plan, Axel!
We're being followed.
It looks like the security guards at Wonder World.
They probably wanna make sure you get on that plane.
Because of you, my future is now in jeopardy.
I mean, real fucking jeopardy.
DeWald is pissed.
Sanderson probably doesn't think too highly of me either.
-Hold up! Stop the car! -What?
-That liquor store. Stop the car! -What? What? What?
-Oh, shit! -[car horn blaring] Wait! Wait!
Axel! Axel!
That's all right. Don't worry. Take it easy. I'll get him. I'll get him.
That's all right. Don't worry. Take it easy. I'll get him. I'll get him. When I do, I'll kill him!
Axel, I left as soon as I got your call. Are you all right? What's going on?
I'm fine, but Dave, listen, I want you to think back real hard to the night that Fry first disappeared. Maybe you forgot to tell me something.
to the night that Fry first disappeared. Maybe you forgot to tell me something. No. Why would you think that?
Because this note by itself, man… it just don't make no sense.
"This is important. Life and death. Roger."
Why would he even send that?
It don't say "Help." He don't say, "I need to talk to you." Nothing. It's just this.
Oh, shit! Fry must have found some sample paper.
And he knew they would kill him, so he sent you it.
-Look, there's a barcode on it. -What does that mean?
That means this paper used to belong to Uncle Sam.
Now we got some evidence. We can put Sanderson and DeWald's ass in jail.
-That's what it means. -I don't think so.
I figured you'd call old Uncle Dave here, so we followed him.
I actually was a real cop once, so I know how you assholes think,
which is to say, slowly.
Very slowly.
So you were carrying around the evidence in your pocket the whole time, huh, Sherlock?
Well, here's how the real ending of the story goes.
Let's see if you like it.
We, at Wonder World, heard you were on the loose.
You had a grudge against the park.
I feared you might try to harm our beloved Uncle Dave,
so I raced over here as fast as I could to try and stop you,
but alas… it was too late.
Get him in the car. Get him all the way in the car.
Take it.
Take it. What's the matter? You worried about fingerprints, Foley?
Forget it. Take a look at the gun. You'll see it's yours.
Give me your weapon.
Pick up the gun and throw it in the street!
Close the door and get over there!
Hold on, Uncle Dave. Damn it!
-[groans weakly] -Don't you die on me, man.
Hey! I got an emergency out here. It's a gut shot. Hey, come on!
Hey, that was Uncle Dave.
-What's his pressure? -It's 90 over 40 and dropping.
All right, Gene, I got to get his pressure up. Let's go, guys.
Pressure cuff. Four units. I need oxygen. Let's go. On three. One, two, three.
Let's get an arterial line in him as well. Any medical history?
Yeah, I've been shot before, but it's no big deal.
-Hey, man, where's the coffee machine? -Down the hall.
-Thanks. -So--
[officer over radio] Attention. This is an all-city alert for a suspect in the Thornton shooting.
The suspect is an African-American male in his thirties, approximately…
You hear some black guy shot Uncle Dave?
-No. -Come on, let's get out of here.
Did you hear? Somebody shot Dave Thornton.
Somebody shot Uncle Dave? Is there a TV here?
Yes, of course.
Authorities believe that Foley may have decided to attack Uncle Dave
in retaliation for some kind of personal rejection.
The much-loved Uncle Dave Thornton is undergoing emergency surgery
at this moment.
According to hospital sources, the prognosis is bleak.
How does a psycho like that live with himself?
Janice, Axel. Get out of the park! They're gonna kill
whoever knows about Roger Fry's note. I got the note. I'm taking it to the feds.
You must be looking for Janice. She can't come to the phone right now.
Can I take a message?
-If you do anything to her-- -It'll be your fault.
I want you at Wonder World within the hour.
Come to the main gate alone and unarmed.
And bring the piece of Mint paper. Oh, then you let us both go?
You don't show up here in a half-hour, alone and unarmed,
and with no cops, I kill your friend.
And it wouldn't be the first time, would it, Foley?
I've just been informed we have an amateur video
of the incident this afternoon involving Uncle Dave's suspected assassin,
Axel Foley.
-[gunshots] -[all scream]
All right, don't shoot, don't shoot. I'm putting my gun down.
I'm putting it down on the ground. I'm not armed. Don't shoot.
That was an amateur video shot earlier today by a tourist.
Would you please take special care of my car?
-Yes, sir. -Thank you.
-Shit -[Serge] Ackwell?
-Surge! Surge, I need a weapon. -Again!
I don't have any weapon. I take all back to the boutique.
-What about this? -Well, this is the floor model.
You know, people been breathing on it, coughing on it, touching it.
-It's not-- -Surge, I need a weapon now.
Donny. Donny, Achmed is in some kind of rush, okay?
So take the Annihilator and just wash it off with some swab of cologne or something.
And take the case and make sure it's nice and pretty, okay?
It's Corinthian leather.
Detective Billy Rosewood, Axel Foley calling.
Axel, listen. Am I your friend? I am your friend.
I'm sure you can explain everything, or maybe you can't explain anything, but you've gotta turn yourself in, man.
I'm going to Wonder World. No! Wait for me! Axel!
Put your arms out and hold for a pat-down.
Foley just arrived, sir.
Take him to control. We have Foley.
Come on.
How much do you want run? All of it.
Axel!
Are you okay? Let's have it, the Mint paper.
Hey, there's a Porsche parked out by the front gate. There's a phone inside.
When she calls back here, I'll give you the Mint paper.
I don't think so. Then we got a stalemate.
Not quite. Orrin.
We kill you both, the paper don't mean jack shit.
How do you know I didn't mail the paper to the Secret Service
with a little note attached to it?
He's bluffing. You think so? Call me.
Orrin, I know how cops think. The note is in the car, right?
The keys, Foley.
Give me the fucking keys.
Drop that fucking gun! Again?
Drop it!
Axel, what the hell are you doing here?
What the hell happened? It's the coolant safety system. Protects the mainframe in case of fire.
It's the coolant safety system. Protects the mainframe in case of fire.
-How do we get it open? -We can't. Not from this side.
He's trying to use an outside line. Do something!
Hello, police?
Shit!
[Ellis] Foley's loose in the park!
I repeat, Foley is loose in the park! Get him!
Mr. DeWald!
We gotta do something. Call for help!
There's no phone in here, just the modem line for the computers.
just the modem line for the computers.
I got it! Just let the computer dial--
The phone would just ring and ring on the other end, and that's it.
What good would that be?
A lot of good. We call Flint's pager.
Foley is in Hometown Square. Foley is in Hometown Square.
-[alarm blaring] -Foley is heading for Alien Attack.
[announcer over speakers] Attention. Attention. This is a red alert.
Alien spacecraft are invading the city.
Board the subway trains for immediate evacuation.
[Axel] He run up those stairs.
-Tell them I need that right away! -[phone ringing]
Ah, damn it. Not again. Excuse me.
-[siren wailing in distance] -Dispatch, this is Flint.
Trace that number that keeps calling me. 555-4085.
[dispatcher] The trace just came in.
It's a computer line at the Wonder World theme park.
Wonder World? Well, call 'em back. Tell them their computer's on the blink.
[dispatcher] We tried that, but all the voice lines
at Wonder World seem to be down.
Must have something to do with that Uncle Dave shooting.
Jesus! Somebody shot Uncle Dave? Some fool named Axel Foley.
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Where the fuck is he?
Get your phone and call the police! I'll try and find Axel!
All right!
There you are. Foley's-- Ah!
♪ Wonderful Wonder World… ♪ Name's Wild Bill Rosewood. I'm the sheriff in this town.
[Flint] What the hell happened here?
[Flint] Shit!
Damn it!
Turn that fucking song off!
Foley? Are you all right?
Hello, Fulbright. You hurt bad?
Look, Foley, I guess I owe you an apology. You were right. I got Sanderson handcuffed in the car.
You were right. I got Sanderson handcuffed in the car. He was in on it, right?
Yeah, you know, I found out about another partner that was in on it.
So long, Foley.
Axel!
You okay?
Any chance you can explain any of this to me? Hm?
Like why the fuck am I shot?
You guys okay?
Are you okay? I'm fine.
I wonder what time the park opens.
[laughs] He needs medical attention.
-Does this hurt? -Don't touch it.
[Uncle Dave] I am so very, very happy to introduce to you our new character in Wonder World,
to introduce to you our new character in Wonder World,
named after a man who's most responsible for my being here today.
[Uncle Dave] Axel Fox!
Hey, I don't think you've seen the Tunnel of Love ride, have you, Axel?
-George! -It's Saturday.
I know, but it's the first day of soccer. It's our first game.
Soccer?
I can't today. I caught a cold while sleeping.
You'll be fine.
Come on, come on, it's gonna be great.
We're going to play like Brazilians.
-Here you go. -Thanks, Mom.
Stuart, don't forget your water bottle. George....
Don't forget your cleats.
You look especially beautiful today.
Some people just know how to wear oatmeal.
Okay, open up.
Did you hear that? She said "blah-blah."
I can't believe it.
Her first word.
Where's the baby book? I'm writing it down.
I'm not sure that's technically a word.
Of course it is.
But Uncle Crenshaw says...
...that every Little starts talking by nine months.
In Uncle Crenshaw's case, never stops.
-Are you both coming to the game? -Wouldn't miss it.
Frederick.
This soccer game's making me very....
-Proud? -Anxious. Especially about....
-I'm fine. -He's fine.
All those boys stomping around with cleats. What if someone...?
Oh, honey. He's a Little. All Littles are natural athletes.
-Do you need...? -Could you?
Okay, that's it for you.
Snow, food.
Food? Is it tuna? Or herring?
Food? Is it tuna? Or herring? Or, dare I say it, is it lox?
Please be lox!
Snow, that's for you.
How about it, boys? Are we ready to play some soccer?
You bet, Dad.
Oh, great. It's glop.
Look what I'm reduced to. I'm a Handi Wipe with hair.
Wallace! Get up! There we go!
That's right! Dig! Dig! Go downfield! Downfield!
You guys, spread out! Spread out!
-Well, George is getting a workout. -Yeah.
What bothers me is that every kid has had a chance to play except Stuart.
There's plenty of time.
Plenty of time? There's 40 seconds.
He did an excellent job of handing out the orange slices...
...and that's not as easy as it looks.
I admit it. I'm glad he's not in the game. I don't want him to get hurt.
I admit it. I'm glad he's not in the game. I don't want him to get hurt. Honey, it's Pee-Wee soccer. Nobody gets hurt.
-Irwin, are you okay? -Irwin, are you okay?
Are you all right, Irwin?
Do I look all right?
Here. Come on.
Better substitute.
Tie game. We could play with just 10.
Yeah, but we have George, so it'll be like having nine.
-Wallace, we'll have none of that. -Come on, coach.
Stuart! Go in for Irwin!
Mom! Dad! I'm going in!
Yeah, Stuart!
Oh, dear.
I want you to watch your tail out there.
Don't worry, coach. I won't let you down.
Now, go get them.
Let's go, let's go! Come on!
Over here! I'm open!
I got it! I got it! I got it!
I'm going down there and snatching him off the field.
Honey, honey.
Knowing boys as I do, I think he might find that just a little....
Embarrassing.
Get it, George!
Go after it!
Pass me the ball, lame-o. Come on.
George, shoot!
I got it! I got it!
Shoot!
I got it! I got it!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, I did it!
I have to start wearing a cup.
He just looked so small out there.
So lacking in bigness. Does he really have to go back next week?
Honey, we have to give him room to grow.
I give him room to grow. I let him slice his own banana.
With a spoon.
I let him drive his car to school. No other mother does that.
With George walking right beside him every step of the way.
Well, how much more room do I have to give him?
A little more than you're giving him now.
Maybe Mom was right.
Maybe I shouldn't be playing soccer anymore.
But what does she want you to go out for?
Painting or dancing.
I guess it's my fault.
I'm sorry I kicked you into the goal.
That's okay. Hey, you won the game. That's the main thing.
No. The main thing is I hit Wallace in the face.
Bogeys, 12:00! I got him, Brooklyn!
Wouldn't it be cool if I actually flew this thing?
Wouldn't it be cool if I actually flew this thing? Yeah. There's only one problem.
-Mom. -Mom.
-Hello, Mrs Little. -Hi, Will.
-Is George home? -He's in with Stuart.
All we need to do is tighten her up and she's ready to fly.
Hi, George. Hi, Stuart.
-Hi, Will. -Hi.
George, you want to take a break? I brought my PS2.
Yeah, okay.
But what about the plane?
I want to play with Will for a while. Play with Snowbell.
Oh, well. Guess I'll have to finish it myself.
If I can just....
Oh, dear.
Hey, what's that noise?
Sounds like a lawn mower.
Inside the house?
-Stuart! -Stuart!
Stuart!
What are you doing?
-I'm not doing anything! -Pull the brake!
Get the book!
This is cool. All my brother does is jam crayons up his nose.
It says, "On takeoff, pull back on the throttle."
Takeoff? I'm in the air!
Snowbell, get out of the way!
Please, don't hurt me!
What's going on?
Nothing. Stuart's just flying in the house.
Flying in the house?
At least he's indoors, nothing bad can happen.
Watch out!
Hit the dirt!
Stuart!
Duck!
Stuart!
Stuart!
-Are you all right? -Are you okay?
I'm okay.
Everything's fine.
Fine? Stuart, you destroyed it.
-I'm sorry I wrecked it, George. -No, no, no.
I'm sure with some glue, we can fix this.
No, we can't. That's going in the trash. It's much too dangerous.
Thanks, Stuart.
Honey, why don't you take the boys home?
I think Stuart and I need to have a little talk.
Good idea.
Come on, boys. Let's go home.
She treats me like a baby.
I'll fix you both some lunch.
She just loves you so much, Stuart. It's hard for her to think of you in danger.
This has been a bad day.
Mom's mad. George doesn't want to play with me.
I know. But every cloud has a silver lining.
Doesn't that make them kind of heavy?
No, it's an expression, Stuart.
The thing about being a Little is you can look at any situation...
...no matter how bleak, how hopeless...
...and still see the bright side. The silver lining.
Like in this situation, the silver lining would be....
Help me, Dad, because I'm struggling.
Okay, George has found a new friend.
That means you could find a new friend.
You're a lot better at this than I am.
I've been a Little a lot longer than you have.
Don't worry. You'll get the hang of it.
Meantime, keep your chin up...
...your back straight and your heart open.
-Then what? -One step at a time.
And Canada is separate from the United States because...
...Canadians like to be alone.
Review tomorrow, test on Friday.
And please take your leftover lunches with you.
My husband is tired of me coming home smelling like salami.
Tony, would you like to come over to my house this afternoon?
Sorry, pal. I've got karate.
Hey, Mark.
Guitar lessons.
Stu, some of the guys are going over to Will's house...
-...to play basketball for a while. -Can I come?
They didn't exactly mention that you were invited.
That's okay. I'm busy anyway.
Just tell Mom I walked you home, okay?
I owe you one.
Sure.
Miss?
Miss?
Are you alive?
She's alive.
Out of the way, please. Out of the way. Injured bird coming through!
What's going on?
My wing.
Where am I? Hey, hey! Where's the falcon?
Falcon. What falcon?
That falcon! Drive! Get out of here!
-Oh, my! -Hey...
...get lost, you disgusting vulture!
Eat my feathers, you vile buzzard!
Do we really want to antagonize him?
Oh, boy, we've got a problem.
No, you can make it. Don't slow down.
You did it.
Yeah. I did.
So who do I have to thank?
Forgive me. My name is Stuart. Stuart Little.
I'm Margalo. Just Margalo.
Margalo.
You're so strong. Are you an athlete?
Well, yeah.
I play a little soccer, fly airplanes, race boats.
You can put me down now. My legs are fine. It's my wing that's hurt.
Yeah. Of course.
There used to be bandages in here.
-Hey, why don't we try your scarf? -Good idea.
My pin, it's....
Must have happened when that falcon smashed into me.
It was part of our nest when I was a baby. I've had it my whole life.
It's the only thing I have left of my mother's.
Gee, that's too bad.
Yeah.
There. How's that?
That's much better, thank you.
So tell me, Stuart Little, do you actually live here?
Oh, yeah. I'm a real Little. I'm the middle child.
The middle Little.
Cute.
So where do you live?
You know, here and there.
Wait, you mean you don't have a home?
Once, we lived in a box. Well, not really a box.
It was one of those things where people keep their jewelry.
A jewelry box?
Yes! That's what it must have been. A jewelry box.
It was wonderful.
Well, I've taken too much of your time. I'd better go before it gets dark.
No, no, wait. You can't go out there.
Not while you're hurt. You should stay here.
I couldn't impose. I mean, you'd really do that for me?
Sure, I have just the thing. I'll be right back.
-Meanwhile, you can use my cat's bed. -You have a cat?
Don't worry about Snowbell. He wouldn't hurt a fly.
Those flies really come back on you.
I try to eat right and yet I still feel bloated.
Maybe more food will help.
Hi, there.
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you!
Scare me? That's a laugh.
Hear that? That was a laugh.
Hairball. Major hairball.
And yet we continue to lick ourselves. Unbelievable.
Snowbell. Meet Margalo. She's gonna be staying with us for a while.
Staying? Are you out of your mind?
Stuart, you can't just drag stray birds in here.
What do you think this is? A halfway house?
Look at her. She's filthy.
No offense. She could have germs.
And how do you know she's not a vagrant or a thief? Get rid of her.
Hi, we're home. Sorry we're late.
-Little hi, Little low. -Little hey, Little ho.
What the heck was that?
That's just how we greet each other.
Interesting.
Nauseating is more like it. You're in for it now, missy.
Mother Little hates when animals walk in here off the street.
When she sees this, she's going to throw a fit.
Such a pretty little birdie.
Maybe it's just my friends she hates.
-I found her. -Found me?
He did more than that. He saved my life.
He did?
-From a falcon. -What was that?
Stuart saved this little bird from a falcon.
A falcon? They are fierce creatures.
Why does the city have falcons? That shouldn't be allowed. Write a letter.
On the other hand, we have a hero here. Way to go, Stuart.
-Hey, Dad. -What?
Silver lining.
It's a guy thing.
Is it?
Isn't it nice that Stuart has a friend?
I don't think Stuart thinks of her as a friend.
-What do you mean? -I mean he's smitten.
-He's infatuated. He's bedazzled. -Stuart?
But he's a baby.
Well, boys start having crushes really young.
Frederick, did you have many crushes?
I'm still having one.
So, Margalo, can I get you anything else?
Whip you up an omelet? Pop you a tart?
Stuart, I'm full.
Full? You eat like a bird.
Come on, Stuart, time for school.
I'm not going to school. I'm staying home to take care of Margalo.
Well, guess again. You are going to school, and I will take care of Margalo.
And look both ways when you cross the street...
...and wear galoshes and, in art class, don't run with scissors.
I'll get your backpack.
Mothers. You know.
-Well, I don't really know. -No?
See, my mom just kind of one day...
...wasn't there anymore.
So you've been completely on your own all your life?
-You bet. -I'll bet it's been scary.
Nah, it's been an adventure.
I wish I had some adventures.
I'm only allowed to paint.
Hey, life is an adventure. Just walking out that door is an adventure.
Come on, Stu. We're late.
Go for it, kid.
The adventure begins.
That feels like enough adventure for one day.
Hey, look! The Yankees won.
Okay.
There we go.
Can you say, "Walk with Mommy"?
"Mommy"?
"Walk"?
Nothing.
Martha and I are going out for a bit. Can I bring you anything?
No, thanks.
Say, "Bye-bye, birdie."
Say, "Bye-bye." Martha, say, "Bye-bye, birdie."
Fresh air.
Remember me?
You scared me.
What can I say? I'm a scary guy.
Margalo, what's going on here?
You case the joint? Any valuables? Come on, thrill me.
They ain't got much.
The mom's got a ring, but it's only two carats.
All right, okay, fine.
So, what else have they got?
Well, you know, not that much. I mean, mostly they just have each other.
A moment while I vomit.
Why don't we just try somewhere else?
Why? Because you're set up here. They trust you. They like you.
And maybe...
...you like them.
Hey, Margalo, come on.
Don't con a conman.
Well, nobody else ever invited me to live with them.
Oh, really? Who found a pitiful orphan bird...
...and plucked her out of the gutter?
Who shared his food with her...
...and, I hasten to add, taught her a trade? Who?
-You did. -I did. Right.
Well, then, straighten up and fly right.
And remember, you are here on business.
You're not here to play around.
Come on, Falcon! When I'm on a job, I never play around!
Are you cold?
I guess when the weather gets too cold, you'll just fly south for the winter?
Well, to tell you the truth, I've never flown south.
It's kind of a dream of mine.
Get out of this cold, windy city, catch that jet stream.
Fruit trees, millions of new birds to meet.
-I hear it's paradise. -Then how come you haven't gone?
-Something's always stopping me. -Yeah.
Something's always stopping me too.
Everybody around here thinks I'm too small to accomplish anything.
Hey, the way I see it, you're as big as you feel.
Yeah. Boy, I'm really glad you fell into my car.
I mean, you know.... I mean, I'm not glad you fell. I just....
Want some more popcorn?
Okay.
What?
My pin.
It's fixed. How...?
On my way home from school, I drive past the place where you crashed...
...it was no big deal.
I mean, there was finding it...
...figuring out how the pieces fit together...
...and, you know, fixing it.
And no big deal. Just....
Scottie.
One, two, three.
Good as new.
No, Stuart, it's not.
It's much, much better.
-Stay with me. -All the time.
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you and your little mouse friend.
Big mistake! Never make a friend I can eat.
Now, get me that ring!
Or the mouse is lunch.
-I'll do the dishes. -But you did them last night.
For you, I would do dishes every night.
That way, I don't have to change the baby.
She just dropped her dolly.
I'll just....
-Frederick! -What?
-My ring. It's gone. -What do you mean, "It's gone"?
It's gone!
-Are you absolutely...? -Positive. Unless....
I'll call the plumber!
What's going on?
Mom's ring went down the drain. I can't reach it.
Hey! What about me?
I can do it. Let me go, Dad.
-Go where? -Down the drain.
I can bring it back up. It's an adventure.
I don't know, Stuart. It's awfully dark down there.
And smelly and cold.
But it's Mom's ring. She loves that ring.
Come on, Dad. Let me try.
Okay, now, if it gets too cold, or too scary...
...you just tell us.
Don't worry, Dad. I can handle it.
Or yank on the string, we'll pull you right up.
Will do.
How's it so far?
Wet. There's a lot of slimy stuff all over the walls.
-What does it look like? -Like the inside of your nose.
-Can you see the bottom yet? -No, just more pipe.
And everything we ate for dinner last week.
And the pipe just seems to go on and on and on.
Well, the plumber said....
What's going on?
Is that a new top?
You know, you have such taste. Simple elegance is what I call it.
What's on the other end of that string?
-This string? -Yes.
Well, now, don't get excited, but someone that you and I love...
...has volunteered to go down the drain to get your ring.
-Stuart? -Good guess, Mom.
Stuart! You let our son go down the kitchen drain?
Now, Eleanor, don't be upset.
It's all been well thought out.
If there's a problem, I simply pull on the string and....
-Now you can be upset. -Stuart!
Are you okay? Can you hear me?
Hurry! I'm slipping.
-Get more string. -Great.
There's gotta be string around here someplace.
-There is no more. -What else can we use as string?
-Spaghetti? -We're out of spaghetti.
-Do we have macaroni? -That's too short.
-We can tie it together with.... -No.
Hurry!
Hang on, Stuart!
-Margalo, what are you doing? -Stuart, I'm coming! Here, grab on!
Lower! Lower!
I got it!
-Are you all right? -Are you hurt?
Don't scare me like that.
Margalo, you're the best friend I ever had.
What if someone had accidentally... ...turned on the garbage disposal while he was down there?
-What about that? -I would not have let that happen.
-You let him go down the drain. -He wanted to go.
If Martha wanted to go up the chimney...
...or George wanted to go into the toilet, would you let them?
Eleanor, I love Stuart as much as you do.
I just don't happen to be quite as....
Emotional? Irrational? What were you going to say?
I forget.
I know I'm being overprotective, it's just....
I can't stand the idea of Stuart getting hurt.
I'm sorry, Stuart.
What?
You people sure like your meat loaf.
You find the ring?
Everything but.
Hey, has anyone seen Margalo? I can't find her anywhere.
Maybe she just went for a walk or a little flight around the neighborhood.
Sure, to strengthen her wing.
Yeah, maybe. But why'd she leave me her pin?
You know, Stuart...
...Margalo is kind of a free spirit.
Maybe she just felt it was time to go.
Without even saying goodbye?
What are you doing?
I think I know what happened. I think that falcon got her.
-Yeah? -I'm going to find her.
And don't try to talk me out of it because I've made up my mind.
And don't try to talk me out of it because I've made up my mind. Are you crazy? You can't go out there.
You mean because I'm too small? Let me tell you something...
You mean because I'm too small? Let me tell you something... ...you're as big as you feel.
All right, then. Let me come with you.
No, no, I need you to stay here and cover for me.
Cover for you? How?
Well, make something up. You're smart.
Stuart, she's just a bird.
No, George, she's my friend.
And when you're friends with Stuart Little, you're friends for life.
Well, if you won't let me come, at least get somebody to go with you.
Snow!
Snowbell!
The good silverware's in the dining room.
Take whatever you want, but don't hurt me.
It's me. Stuart.
You. This better be important.
Margalo's still missing.
I should've been more specific. I meant important to me.
I was going out to look for her. Come with me.
Look, Stuart, do yourself a favor. Buy a parakeet and forget her.
I can't forget her. She's in terrible trouble and I have to help her.
I mean, what am I? A man or a mouse?
Is that a trick question?
Come on. It's important. You got to help me.
And why would I do that?
Well, because we're family...
...and because I'd do the same for you.
And if you don't, and the Littles ask where I've gone...
...George is gonna tell them that you ate me.
What?
Why, you little rat!
You know something?
Everybody thinks you're so nice. You're not so nice.
Come on! It'll be fun. It's an adventure.
Hey! Mario Andretti, slow down. Let's pace ourselves.
I'm gonna have a heart attack.
I think I'm having a thrombosis and I don't even know what it means.
George! Stuart! Breakfast!
Get it while it's hot.
Say, "Mama."
Say, "Dada."
Say anything?
Morning, George.
-Where's Stuart? -He already left.
He did? Without eating breakfast?
He had to get to school early...
...because he's in a school play.
Really?
Yes. He plays a mouse.
And they rehearse every morning before school.
Why didn't he tell us?
He forgot. You know, being worried about Margalo.
Right.
-Well, good. This'll keep his mind off it. -Yeah.
Got to go.
Say, "Oatmeal."
Oh, boy. This is a sign, Stuart. Like the burning bush.
Except it's a carburetor and I'm not Moses.
But it's telling us something.
Let your people go!
-We're not giving up. -Why not?
Giving up is fun. And look at all the time you save.
I'm telling you, Stuart, if more people gave up, there'd be fewer wars.
Bill.
George.
Hi, Mom.
Hi.
Where's Stuart?
You mean he's not home?
I just remembered. He told me to tell you that he's rehearsing again.
At Will's house. And he's sleeping over there tonight.
Sleepover? On a school night?
Hey, that's what he said. Got to go.
Hello?
Hey, Will. It's me, George. If my mom calls, Stuart's at your house, okay?
Hold on a second.
Hello?
Will, hi. It's Mrs Little. May I speak with Stuart, please?
-Stuart? -You know, my son.
Stuart. You mean now?
Well, now is when I'm calling.
He just went in the bathroom.
I think he's gonna be a while. He brought a magazine.
-Well, then, is your mother there? -Hold on a second.
-I told her. -Did she buy it?
Yeah, but now she wants to speak to my mom. What will I tell her?
Make something up. You're smart.
If I was smart, I wouldn't be in this situation.
She can't come to the phone right now. She's in the bathroom too.
But not the same bathroom!
-Then just let her know I called. Thanks. -Okay, Mrs Little.
-It's all clear. -I owe you one.
Yeah. But now will you tell me what's going on?
It's too complicated. Later.
Little hi, Little low.
Little hey, Little ho.
-Boys home? -Well, George is.
But Stuart is rehearsing his play...
...and then he's sleeping over at Will's house tonight.
-He's going without George? -Well, I think it'll give him room to grow.
Stuart, we've been walking for hours. I can't take another step.
You know me, I hate to be negative. But when I walk this much, I chafe.
Also, I hate to bring this up...
...but I need to go tinky.
How about the alley?
I'm a house cat. We're fastidious creatures.
We don't just yell, "Bomb's away," and go wherever we are!
Look, let's face it. We're never gonna find her.
If only we knew someone who really knew the city.
Yeah, someone who knows the city's disgusting underbelly.
Who do I know that's disgusting?
You come back here again...
...I'll run you through the Visa machine!
Don't you threaten me! What I could tell the health inspector...
...would close you down in a New York minute!
Hey, Monty!
Snowbell! Hey! Snowbell, what are you doing here?
-We've been looking all over for you. -We need your help.
Hey, Snow, buddy, are you two still friends or can I eat him?
-No, Monty, you can't eat him. -Please.
No! Now, pay attention.
What do you know about a bird called Falcon?
Falcon? That's a bad guy. You don't want to fool with him.
-You know where we can find him? -You don't want to find him.
You don't want anything to do with him. Trust me.
He'd eat you so fast you'd be a pile of falcon poop before you could yell for help.
Falcons are vicious.
They grab you by the back of the neck and carry you so high...
...you can't even see the ground.
Then they drop you. By the time you hit the pavement...
...they just drink what's left through a straw.
Snowbell, are you all right?
Oh, yeah. In fact, good news.
I no longer need a litter box.
Mop up on aisle three.
Snowy.
Stu, listen. This whole thing has been a groove and a gas...
...but it's important to know when the fun's over.
You don't want to be that last pathetic person who leaves a party.
You don't want to be that last pathetic person who leaves a party. I told you. I'm not giving up. We're going to find the falcon.
Well, all right, then. It's your funeral.
Okay, listen. Listen carefully.
The falcon lives across the park...
...at the very tiptop of the Pishkin Building.
Not many people go up there. And even fewer return.
Well, here we are, Snowbell. This is it.
Snowbell.
"Salmon, catfish, tuna."
Why do they taunt me?
Snowbell, how can you think of food at a time like this?
Stay on track, will you?
Look, I'm nervous. When I'm nervous, I eat.
Because I know in my growling gut that if anything happens to you, I'll be blamed.
I'm sure the Littles already know we're gone...
...and are planning to replace me with a hamster.
Don't worry. George has us covered.
George? George doesn't know poop from applesauce.
And I say that with a great deal of affection.
-Hello, Little residence. -George. I'm glad you answered.
Who is it? Can you speak louder, please?
George, it's me, Stuart.
Stuart!
Stuart. Where are you? How are you?
Did you find her? Are you all right? How's Snowbell?
When are you coming home? Mom and Dad are asking a lot of questions.
So are you.
I only have a second. I want you to know that we're on the trail...
...and with any luck at all, we'll be home by dinnertime.
-And, George. -Yeah?
-Thanks for covering for me. -Sure.
But where are you?
Now, listen closely. We're at the Pishkin Building.
Please deposit $0.35 for the next five minutes.
-Snowbell, I need more change. -What do I look like, a fanny pack?
-Stuart, Stuart, are you still there? -George, is that Stuart?
Let me think. Yeah.
Where is he? I thought he was coming home.
He is. Later. He and Will just need to rehearse some more.
In fact, I just left him at Will's.
Hello, Mrs. Little. Is George home?
Will?
-Will, I found it! -Found what?
-The calculator. -The calculator?
Will, where's Stuart?
Stuart?
It's all right. She knows about the play.
It's supposed to be a surprise.
I had to tell her so she'd know Stuart's at your house...
...and we're going right back over there.
Oh, yeah. Right. It's going to be great.
I just need to get the calculator.
To figure out how long they should rehearse.
Yeah, it's a very complicated play.
-Yeah, let's go. -See you later, Mrs. Little.
Okay, but, George, don't forget you two have a soccer game later.
We'll meet you there!
I can't handle this. I'm too stressed. All this lying. I've never lied before.
That's why she believes you.
-Boy, are we in trouble. -"We"?
Yeah, "we." He didn't spend the night rehearsing at my house.
What are you planning to do, Mighty Mouse, scale the wall?
I'll think of something.
So long, Snowbell!
You've got guts, kid.
Guts and spunk.
Not to mention moxie.
You've got guts, spunk and moxie.
Okay. Here we go.
All right, Falcon. Hand her over and nobody gets hurt.
Margalo? Margalo?
You up here?
Is anybody here?
I'm here.
I came for my friend Margalo. If you've hurt her, I'll....
-You'll what? -You better tell me right now.
Is she all right?
Why don't you ask her yourself, Whiskers? Margalo.
Margalo. Margalo, run!
Fly away while I've got him covered. What are you waiting for?
This kid's priceless. Tell me, Cheese-face, does this sound familiar?
"My wing. I don't think I can fly."
What are you talking about?
I can't drill through the wood. She scammed you, okay?
She played you like a harp.
Margalo, what does he mean?
Okay, now it's getting sad. Maybe this will clear things up.
My mom's ring.
I'm so sorry. I never wanted to hurt you.
But, Margalo, why?
Don't be upset, Mouse-boy.
She has conned smarter than you. Or did you think you were special?
A real friend?
I didn't lie about that, Stuart.
You are my friend.
Then come with me.
She's not going anywhere.
Yes, she is.
Was that your best shot? Now, let me show you mine.
Don't hurt him, Falcon!
I won't hurt him. The sidewalk will!
Can't we talk this over?
No! Stuart!
Let me go! No, Falcon! No!
A few days in here should provide you with an attitude adjustment.
Stuart. What have I done?
I'll bet something terrible has happened. The Littles will kill me.
I know. I'll bring home another mouse in a snazzy outfit...
...teach him to drive a sports car and pass him off as Stuart.
Who am I kidding? I have to get up there. But how?
I hope I live to regret this.
Stuart?
Stuart?
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Please don't jump out from behind anything.
Remember, I have a strong stomach, but a very weak heart.
Here, Mousie-Mousie.
Snowbell? Is that you? Is that really you?
-Margalo? Where are you? -In the can.
Okay. I'll wait.
No, in the paint can.
Why are you in there? Is this some kind of trick?
Just get me out.
Is Stuart in there too?
No, Snowbell, he's dead.
What? Stuart is dead?
Falcon killed him.
No. He can't be, he's....
I was supposed to protect him.
I wish it was me who had been killed.
Really?
No. But I am very unhappy!
Oh, dear. I'm dumped on a boat.
I'm on a garbage barge. I got to get off.
Hello! Hello, there!
I'm over here! On the barge! Can you hear me?
Help!
I'm not supposed to be here!
I need to get off!
Help me!
Help!
Rita, hi. I was in the neighborhood so I thought I'd pick up the boys.
-George and Will? -George and Stuart.
Well, George is here, but I haven't seen Stuart.
But he slept over here last night.
No.
George!
What are you going to do now?
Which way's Canada?
This is terrible.
I just want to go home.
I know a Little is supposed to always see a silver lining.
Maybe this means I'm not really a Little.
Maybe I'm just Stuart Nobody.
Stuart Nothing.
There is no silver lining!
Oh, no. What have I done?
My plane.
My plane!
The silver lining! This is it!
-All right, George, where is he? -And this time, the truth.
-I'm not sure. -George.
It is never okay to lie to your parents.
But is it okay to break a promise to your brother?
It's wrong to promise your brother that you'll lie to your parents.
Listen to the tone of my voice. I want you to tell us where Stuart is.
But it was a promise. Brother to brother.
George, I understand. I have a brother.
Whatever I promised him, if he was in danger...
...that would matter more to me than the promise.
...that would matter more to me than the promise. George, how would you feel, how would we all feel if anything happened to Stuart?
George, how would you feel, how would we all feel if anything happened to Stuart?
He's at the Pishkin Building.
-Dad. -What?
-Am I in trouble? -No, son. You're in big trouble.
-Mom, Dad, I'm really sorry. -You should be.
For all we know, Stuart could be out there now, lying face down with his....
Or he could be fine. We don't have to assume the worst.
After all, it's not the Little way.
Yes, you're right. I mean, he could be puttering home... -...right now in his shiny little car. -Smiling and happy.
-...right now in his shiny little car. -Smiling and happy.
His whiskers fluttering in the breeze.
-Mom. -Yes, George.
I don't think he's puttering home.
Who would do this?
Tiny little vandals.
That miserable falcon!
From this day forward, I vow revenge.
If that falcon were here right now, I'd rip his throat out.
I'd scratch his face off. I'd....
Snowbell, that's him.
Please. Don't hurt me.
Kill the bird, not me.
I'm going to be falcon poop.
Well, well, well. The canary is out of her cage.
And how nice. She's brought a friend for dinner.
Too bad I don't like canned food.
Snowbell, get out!
Can't. Stuck. Too fat!
Don't do it, Falcon. Or else!
Do what? What's he doing?
Or else what?
Or else you'll lose this.
Put that down, Margalo.
I'm through doing what you tell me to do. I'm leaving you, Falcon, forever.
And what do you think you'll be without me?
Free.
Big mistake. I'll be back for you, fur-ball.
Don't hurry!
-Stuart! You're alive! -So far!
Where'd you get the plane?
A garbage dump.
Sorry I asked.
I hope we're not too late.
Keep your eyes peeled. He could be anywhere.
Careful now. One step at a time.
That's it. You're going to make it. Yeah!
I'm alive. I'm alive.
Stuart! Is that you? Take me with you!
What about me? How will I get down from here?
-I think this is it. Turn here. -Okey-dokey. No problem.
-Hey, look! It's Stuart. -Stop the car!
-Stuart! -Stuart!
Look at that bird. He's bigger than me.
We got to save him. Come on.
It's the Littles. I'm saved!
Wait! It's me!
-Follow that flying mouse. -Okey-dokey.
Hey-Little, Ho-Little, Hoo-Little, Hey-Hottle, Ho-Wottle, Wo-Wittle.
There he is!
If we get out of this, I'm sticking to painting and dancing.
Hey, lady! What are you doing? Get out of the way!
He's closing in.
Oh, my goodness.
Keep it running.
Okey-dokey. No problem.
-Stuart. Stuart. -He can't hear you.
I think we lost him.
Going up?
Frederick, I feel so helpless.
A mouse needs to know his limitations.
Stuart! Pull up!
I can't! It's stuck!
Well, try harder!
Margalo! Get out! Save yourself!
No, Stuart! If we go, we go together!
-Stuart! -Stuart!
Stuart! Pull up!
-Pull up, Stuart! -Stuart, pull up!
You should've stayed in your little hole, Mouse-boy.
Stuart, we can't outrun him.
Then we'll just have to face him.
It's too dangerous. I won't let you do it.
But I have to try. I'll be back for you later.
What do you mean?
Stuart! Don't do it!
Party's over, Fur-face.
-Frederick, what's he doing? -They're gonna crash!
Stuart! Turn! Run away!
Bye-bye, Birdbrain!
Oh, dear.
Got you.
Can't I get a decent meal in this city?
Thank you.
Stuart! Are you okay?
I am now. Margalo saved me.
We saved each other.
What did you think you were doing?
-You almost gave me a heart attack. -I'm sorry, Mom.
-You ran away from home. -I know.
-And you had George lie to us. -Yeah.
Then why am I so proud of you?
Mrs. Little, this belongs to you.
My ring.
Yeah, I took it.
And now she's giving it back.
I'm just happy to have all of you back.
Snowbell!
You made it.
-Thank goodness you're all right. -Snowbell, where have you been?
You wouldn't believe what Stuart and Margalo have been through.
Snowbell.
You should have seen it. These two were so brave.
Let's go home.
And how about me? I played no part in this?
Well, I have had enough! I'm staying right here, folks!
Oh, yeah. You'll never see me again!
Snow, want some tuna when we get home?
Tuna? I love these people.
Wait! Wait for me!
I guess they're flying south for the winter?
I guess.
You've always dreamed of going, haven't you? But Falcon never let you.
Every year I'd just watch all the other birds go.
The ones who were free.
You're free.
Stuart.
We'd be so far apart.
It wouldn't change a thing.
Well....
You sure you know where you're going? We can call AAA.
We can get you maps, discount coupons.
There's a place in South Carolina...
...where they do the best pecan pie you have ever tasted.
I'm a bird. Instinct should take over.
I guess you've waited for this a long time.
All my life. Only....
Only what, dear?
Well, now it's not just talk. Now, it's the real thing.
Are you scared?
The world's pretty big, and I'm pretty small.
Somebody once told me, "You're as big as you feel."
Just spread your wings...
...and soar.
I'll miss you, Stuart.
I'll miss you too.
I'll miss all of you.
You too, Snowbell.
I'm not going to cry.
Little hi, Little low.
-Little hey, Little ho. -Little hey, Little ho.
Stuart?
Yeah, Dad?
What's the silver lining this time?
She'll be back in the spring.
Bye-bye, birdie.
Did you hear that?
I don't believe it. Her first words! She spoke!
-Of course she did. -I knew she could do it.
We have killed Mesopotamians!
We have killed Assyrians,
Mycenaeans, Sumerians.
But
we have never had the pleasure of killing
an Akkadian.
Which limb do I take first?
May the gods have pity on you
because my brother will not.
[softly] Boo.
You missed.
You're lucky we have the same mother.
[narrator] Before the time of the pyramids a fearsome horde came from the east
and swept across the barren lands of the ancient world.
By the law of the horde
their greatest warrior was proclaimed their king.
His name was Memnon.
He was the greatest swordsman the world had ever seen.
With the predictions of a sorcerer
who could foretell the outcome of every battle,
Memnon slaughtered all who resisted him
until only a brave few remained.
-Silence! -My father has called for silence!
Hold your tongues!
We are gathered in this place to put our differences aside.
There is still time for us, the last of the free tribes,
to stand together against this tyrant.
With his sorcerer at his side, no mortal can defeat Memnon.
And if the sorcerer were to die, what then?
It's too late for your schemes, Pheron.
I have raided Memnon's caravans, broken the supply lines to his troops,
but he still swept across the land like a plague.
I will not send my people to their deaths in a battle that can't be won.
And what people would that be, Balthazar?
You are the ruler of nothing but a pile of rocks and sand.
If I'm no king,
why are you on your knees before me?
Balthazar! Guards!
Akkadians. I thought they were wiped out long ago.
[King Pheron] They are the last of their kind.
By their hand, the sorcerer will die.
You put your faith in a clan of cutthroats who kill for money?
They are more than that. They are skilled assassins
trained for generations in the deadly arts.
And what price do these mercenaries ask from us, Father?
Twenty blood rubies.
-That's the last of our treasury. -Be quiet.
If these men kill the sorcerer, will you fight?
So be it.
As long as one of us still breathes
the sorcerer will die.
Assassin!
Him, we'll kill for free.
[Jesup] We can reach Memnon's encampment by nightfall.
When are you gonna get rid of that filthy beast?
He doesn't mean anything by it.
-Horses are faster. -But camels are smarter.
[Mathayus] That one's mine.
Live free.
Die well.
Stop. Stop. Listen to me. I am a high priest of Set.
Spare me, and I shall bless thee in five different languages.
You'll scream in five different languages.
-Horse thief. -Wait! Wait!
Hey! I'm not that heavy.
Look out for the fat one! He's behind you!
Help me! Help me! Whoever you are, help me!
-Oh, thank you. Thank you, good sir. -Quiet.
Surely you've heard of the enormous reward for my safe return.
[Jesup] The sorcerer's tent.
Back!
[guard 1] Make way! [guard 2] Find the other one!
You've been betrayed, Mathayus.
-You know my name? -And why you're here.
[guard 1] He's in the tent!
A living, breathing Akkadian. This is a rare pleasure.
I hear you train yourselves to bear great pain.
You must teach me this, if you live long enough.
Not looking so full of yourself, are you now, assassin?
You betrayed your own father?
You betrayed your own father? Yes. He was very shocked.
Yes. He was very shocked.
You could tell by the look on his face.
By my father's head, I pledge my allegiance.
[Memnon] You have proven your loyalty, Takmet.
This one still lives.
Beautiful.
Bring him to me.
Mathayus.
Mathayus.
Live free.
Die well, my brother.
So,
how shall this one die?
-He shall not die tonight. -Really?
-We shall see. -Nor shall he die by your hand
-We shall see. -Nor shall he die by your hand or any hand you command.
You have seen this in a vision?
To ignore this would bring great misfortune.
The gods show him favor on this night.
Just the gods?
A puzzle then.
How to kill you without using my hand or any hand I command?
[Arpid] Fascinating, isn't it?
The smoke, it causes the fire ants to abandon their homes, you see?
All the sooner to feast on our naked heads.
-You think this is funny? -It's a little bit funny. Yes.
You see, I am about to escape while you are about to die a horrible death for leaving me to die last night.
while you are about to die a horrible death for leaving me to die last night.
-So what are you waiting for? -You see that one up there?
He's been drinking that yak piss for about an hour now and sometime very soon...
Ah, you see?
Hey! Where's the horse thief?
All right. Come on. Get me outta here.
Do you promise not to kill me?
-Yes, I promise. -Remember, you are an Akkadian.
You make an oath, you always have to keep it, right?
That's right.
Promise to take me with you and share in the spoils of your adventures.
What? All right. Fine. Yes, I promise.
All right. Now hold still.
Oh, here's one. That's a big one!
My! Here comes the mother.
[Arpid] So, where are we going?
[Mathayus] To Memnon's kingdom to avenge my brother's death.
-Never touch the bow. -Not a problem.
-Who are you calling? -My ride.
It's a nice camel.
Not much room back here. Scoot up, please.
Hey! We had a deal!
That's right. And I haven't killed you yet.
[Memnon] What news from my sorceress today?
[Memnon] What news?
Your armies will conquer in the west.
Queen Isis's forces will scatter to the four winds.
Give the generals the news.
Have them make their armies ready for the final campaign.
Yes, my lord.
[Memnon] You think I'm cruel, don't you?
Perhaps you've forgotten what it's like outside these walls.
Heartless, ignorant, and savage.
But I can change that.
I will bring order after centuries of chaos.
An order which will last for 1,000 years.
Rivers of blood can never bring peace.
But they can bring obedience. That will suffice for now.
And when I have become the king of legend,
then you shall take your place beside me
on a throne and in my bed.
But, my lord,
in your bed I would lose my gift of sight
and you would lose your advantage in battle.
The day I speak of
is the day I no longer need your vision.
[Arpid] Gomorrah.
Let me tell you,
after a hard day of looting and pillaging, there is no greater city than Gomorrah.
Except maybe Sodom.
-I wish I could join you. -You're not going?
Believe me, I'd like to even the score with a few of those Red Guards myself.
But with the price I've got on my head, I'd never make it through those gates.
I have faith in you, my friend. You'll get us in.
You see? They've got the city sealed up tighter than a crab's buttocks.
I wish there was something I could do to help, but...
Oh, but there is.
What business do you have here?
I've come to collect a bounty.
-Horse thief. -Oh. I know this dog.
-Horse thief. -Oh. I know this dog. They'll behead him for sure this time.
He'll be all the prettier without it.
-What happened? -You got us in. I knew you could do it.
A jug of your finest wine for my road-weary friend here.
Wait a minute. The last thing that... That I remember was this huge Akkadian fist coming straight into...
That I remember was this huge Akkadian fist coming straight into...
Here's your wine, sir.
Please, let me know if there's anything else you'd like.
It's good to be back in the big city.
-Watch my camel for me? -Gladly.
Been working here long time?
How's the kebab?
[merchant] Merchandise of the highest quality. Virgin steel forged by the monks of Pompeii.
Here! Here they are! The world's finest swords.
You can't get respect in Gomorrah without a quality blade...
Birds of paradise, birds of prey. The most beautiful birds in the world.
Hey, soldier. Those big muscles look cramped.
-Perhaps one of us can help you relax. -Maybe all of us.
Mister, mister. Guide, mister.
You need a guide to find your way in Gomorrah.
A good guide might be able to show me a way into Memnon's palace.
But a smart guide wouldn't, or he'd be shown into Memnon's dungeon.
I don't have it.
Do you wanna earn this one?
Get ready. I'll kill half, you kill half.
All right. I'll kill them all.
How about we go around them and not kill anybody?
-Good Lord. Are you going to kill me? -Maybe later.
Memnon's always threatening to have my head.
[Philos] Don't touch that. -What is it? -That's my special magic powder.
-What is it? -That's my special magic powder.
[Tutu] Magic powder?
Yeah, magic powder.
It's a Chinese formula that I procured at great expense.
If I get the recipe right, it'll move mountains,
clear roadways in an instant.
Do great things, wonderful things.
Or terrible things.
Like all my inventions, Memnon will try to use it for war.
-Where is Memnon? -Oh, you mean to kill him, do you?
-Yes. -Well, in that case,
-Yes. -Well, in that case, I'd say he was in the training courtyard.
[Tutu] No! Let me go!
I didn't do anything!
You know the penalty for thievery.
No!
Oh, no.
No!
[guard] Intruder!
Follow me!
-You again. -How do I get outta here?
Through that door.
-What's that? -That's one of my latest inventions.
It was meant to be a means of quick transportation
but there was a little problem with the landings.
[Thorak] Open!
-Open! -Don't touch that. You'll set it off.
Right.
A man.
-What is this place? -Lord Memnon's harem.
-What is this place? -Lord Memnon's harem. -But he visits so rarely. -And it gets so lonely.
-But he visits so rarely. -And it gets so lonely.
-Can't you leave me alone, Thorak? -Watch your tongue, Philos.
Careful with those! They're delicate instruments.
You're lucky Lord Memnon has a taste for your "science," you old fool.
If I find out you had anything to do with this intruder
I will send the executioner.
We know how to please.
-Oh, I'm sure you do, ladies, but I... -Stay with us.
-Stay with us. -That's nice, but now's not a good time.
We will make your every fantasy come true.
Kill him!
After him!
Go get him!
Well, are you gonna try to kill me or just stare at me?
Take a breath.
Gods be praised!
How dare you touch me!
Sorceress, I am an Akkadian hired to kill you.
Now, I find myself in a position where you are of more use to me alive.
Don't make me change my mind.
And he said it's not the size of the hump,
it is the motion of the camel.
Alas, I must leave you now.
-There's the traitor! -Oh, great gods!
He is dead! Just admit it, you smelly camel!
I am your master now! You belong to me!
He's dead! Dead!
Dead!
You are alive. I knew it!
Right.
I was just saying to the camel,
"Camel, no one could kill our good friend Mathayus."
Get on.
Why should I make it easy for you? You're sworn to kill me.
Others will die first.
That's comforting.
-So who is your friend? -Memnon's sorcerer.
Memnon's sorcerer? Are you insane? She's going to get us all killed!
Memnon will have to leave the safety of his palace to get her.
So you're going to use me first and then kill me? I feel so much better.
I could always do it the other way around and kill you first.
So where are we going?
-The Valley of the Dead. -The Valley of the Dead?
Nobody goes to the Valley of the Dead!
That's why they call it the Valley of the Dead!
Wait for me, please!
Take a dozen of your best men, track him down, kill him,
and bring her back to me.
Send me news when he's dead.
-Yes, my lord. -My lord.
There are rumors spreading to the armies that she's gone.
-Is this true? -It is, my lord.
-Is this true? -It is, my lord. Then silence them! They must believe she is here,
Then silence them! They must believe she is here, if only for a short time.
And when you find the Akkadian,
give him this from me.
[Arpid] Are we where I think we are?
Yes.
Home.
Where are you going, Sorceress?
In a hurry to get back to Memnon?
No, I'm in a hurry to get away from you. I'll never go back to Memnon.
He's kept me prisoner since I was a child.
Why did you help me that night in the tent?
I knew you were the one man who could help me escape.
Run if you like. There are worse dangers out there than me.
[Mathayus] What do you mean you can't find it?
-I know it's around here somewhere. -What are you looking for?
Just a little place to get out of the storm.
-What storm? -You'll see.
Thorak.
Memnon didn't come, did he?
-Sent his maggots to do his work. -He's smarter than you think.
Or more cowardly.
Can I go home now?
Stay here. Cover up.
You'll be safe.
He's attacking! Alone?
The sun has fried his brain.
One thousand duranas for the one that brings me his head.
[Thorak] Akkadian bastard!
Where is he?
This way!
You two first. Come on. Go.
Stay on the stones.
Come with me.
Don't touch that.
[Thorak] Coward!
Show your face!
The Akkadian.
Mathayus!
[Arpid] You are alive! You swatted them like flies! You are invincible!
Tell me. Do you think you can save him?
His fever's high. The poison was made with scorpion venom.
His fever's high. The poison was made with scorpion venom. If he does live, the blood of the scorpion will always flow through his veins.
If he does live, the blood of the scorpion will always flow through his veins.
Sorceress.
It's a miracle.
She cured you. I knew it! I felt her magic!
It almost killed her, but the gods, they were on our side.
Why? Why would you risk your life to save mine?
Because I believe you can save the people.
The people are not my problem. Memnon is.
You and the people have the same problem.
Pardon, my lord. A message from Thorak.
Finally, the Akkadian is dead.
Is there something wrong, my lord?
Not at all. Everything is in order.
In fact, things are going so well that I'm moving up our plans.
Tomorrow night, we feast to celebrate our impending victory.
And then we'll drive the last of the rebels into the sea.
Now, go.
My lord,
it is customary for the sorceress to be present at these meetings.
Why is she not here today?
-She's indisposed. -It is nothing serious, I hope.
If it were serious, then you would know about it.
Now, go!
She is alive. She is with him and he's coming here.
Get ready.
It works! It works!
My lady. How lovely to see you out here in this desolate place!
Let me show you. It works!
Come, come, come!
My lady sorceress.
You see? I worked it out.
My Chinese formula. My magic powder works!
All I needed was salt. Petered salt.
It was here all the time. This place is just full of it.
By the way, do any of you happen to have any water?
What do you think? Is it safe to drink?
Not anymore.
Delicious. The sandstone must act as a natural filter.
Quiet.
I'm alive! I'm alive!
For the moment.
Mathayus.
Move!
Assassin. The gods are good to me.
When we last met, you offered to kill me. Now I have a chance to return the favor.
You're trespassers here.
Our survival depends on this place being kept a secret.
So we have a problem as long as you're alive.
[Arpid] No problem. I can keep a secret like no other.
In fact, I cannot remember how we got here. We took a left turn...
-It's too late for that. -[Queen Isis] Balthazar!
This place is sanctuary for all of Memnon's enemies. -You know that. -This man is dangerous.
-You know that. -This man is dangerous. -Your judgment is clouded. -My judgment keeps all of you alive.
-Your judgment is clouded. -My judgment keeps all of you alive.
This man cannot be trusted, and I'll prove it.
Bring the woman to me.
The first man to touch her will have to come through me.
I had hoped for nothing less.
That's not fair.
[woman] Get him.
No!
Yeah!
-Do you yield? -Never.
Then you're a fool.
-We're brothers in the same cause. -Brothers?
You brought death to my people. Memnon will follow you. He will come for his sorceress.
Memnon will follow you. He will come for his sorceress.
Yes, I know who she is.
And Memnon will stop at nothing till she's returned.
He'll come swifter and deadlier once he has her. Memnon will stop at nothing.
Hide here as long as you can, but believe me when I say he'll find you.
And if he isn't stopped, he'll sweep across this land and kill all of you.
And who's gonna stop him, Akkadian?
You? Will you stand alone before the fury of his armies?
Yes.
-A gentleman always lets a lady win. -You didn't. Best two out of three?
Dates?
Oh, thank you.
[Memnon] Cassandra!
I've had a vision.
Memnon will follow me here and destroy these people.
You know this?
The things I see are like shimmers in a pond.
Some are certain, and some remain shadows.
But I do know this.
Memnon will release his armies and ride straight through this place.
Memnon will die by my hand.
It seems the gods favor me tonight, Akkadian.
If you face Memnon, you'll die.
That is your destiny.
I make my own destiny.
I need your help.
Where do you think you're going with my horse?
To Gomorrah. Nothing we can say will stop him.
Without your sorceress?
She returned to save the lives of your people.
I won't let her face Memnon's wrath alone.
-Step aside. -[Balthazar] Akkadian,
-Step aside. -[Balthazar] Akkadian, you're riding to your death.
If I let you ride alone,
what glory will there be left for me?
So tonight we celebrate.
Eat and drink your fill
for tomorrow we ride into battle.
I would've captured him myself, but he ran like a coward.
He left his bow behind.
My lord.
There is something that is troubling our soldiers.
How distressing. Pray tell.
It's been said the sorceress is no longer by your side.
Soldiers will fall prey
to idle palace gossip.
You have my word, she's perfectly safe.
If the men are to fight, to die, they may need more than that.
-Do you doubt my word? -It is not that, sire.
It's just she is a symbol from which the men derive courage.
-Symbols are most effective when seen. -[Cassandra] My lord.
I am here at your request.
Pardon my absence.
I was not well.
But our impending victory has lifted my spirit.
Is this sufficient to placate your men?
Tell them what you see, Sorceress.
I see a great victory.
Your enemies will reveal themselves to you.
Halt.
-What is in the cart? -"What is in the cart"?
Actually, it is a bit of a surprise.
A gift for tonight's festivities.
Prince Takmet's request.
Very nice.
Well, now. Let's see that pretty little face.
Now go to my chambers. We have things to discuss.
My sincerest apologies, my lord.
I understand.
You are fearful, weak.
The feast is over.
To bed, men, for tomorrow we conquer.
Fortify the palace guard.
[Mathayus] All right. That was the easy part.
-Everybody know what to do? -Cripple the guards.
-Ignite the powder. -And try not to get killed.
What are you doing here? You could get hurt.
So could you.
Stay in the wagon.
You watch yourself, Akkadian.
-No need for concern, miss. -Oh, he's gonna pay for that.
-No need for concern, miss. -Oh, he's gonna pay for that. Hey, hey.
Seal the gates. Seal all the gates.
Though I'm relieved to see you unharmed,
I am somewhat surprised the Akkadian didn't kill you.
He was after you. I was merely a pawn.
But you escaped his grasp?
I'm not without my wiles.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. Bring them.
Tomorrow my victory is complete.
-That is your vision? -As I said, I have seen it.
Have you?
I sense a change in you.
You seem somehow
diminished.
I assure you. I am myself.
Good. A small demonstration shouldn't trouble you then.
A simple test.
Now go. Everyone leave.
Where am I going? Stop.
It's over there. Should be just there.
[Philos] Good man.
Well, well.
What do we have here?
One at a time.
Six urns, four cobras.
Now, let's see what you can see.
Excellent.
One empty pot left now.
Who dies first?
We're almost there.
You know what I see? Fear.
You have lost your power,
thrown it all away.
-What magic is this? -My magic.
I see your fate, hollow king.
And its time has come.
You wish to test magic against steel?
I've come for the woman and your head.
The assassin and the sorceress,
how romantic.
I'll bury you both together.
And here it is, the foundation stone.
-Hurry, we're running out of time. -I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying.
Fire in front, palace guard at your back.
Looks like I'll be keeping my head after all, Akkadian.
Kill the witch!
Mathayus!
For your father.
Die well, assassin.
It seems the gods favor me tonight, Akkadian.
Mathayus!
Hurry up and light it. You hurry up and light it. This is your invention.
Follow me.
Ready! Weapons!
Charge!
So much for not getting killed.
Catch this.
-Hail to the king! -[soldiers] Hail, hail!
I knew it from the start.
-Hail! -Yeah!
-Hail! -Yeah! Mathayus!
Stay here with us, Balthazar. There's much work to be done.
I have to look after my own people.
You're a king now, Akkadian, and a good one, I think.
Don't forget how you got here or the people you came from.
My people will live on through me.
Remember, there'll always be a place for you here.
-Live free. -Rule well.
Remember, Nubian eyes will be watching you, Scorpion King.
I see a time of great peace and prosperity ahead.
How is it you see this?
Don't the legends say you'll lose your powers if you...
Can you think of a better way to keep a king from taking advantage?
Well, neither could my ancestors.
And how long will this time of peace last?
Nothing lasts forever, my king.
Courtyard in back, south-facing garden. Perfect.
-Shouldn't we wait for the car service? -No, we'll sit in traffic forever.
-Is that the listing sheet? -There isn't one.
I heard about it this morning. It'll be gone today.
-How many more? -None. You know the market is tight.
-Sarah, do you have to ride that here? -Mom, we're in the street.
Evan!
One day you will learn to respect people's time, Lydia.
You'll realize that the world does not stop and start at your convenience.
I'm so sorry.
I'm meeting Arthur Digby Laurence in 26 minutes...
...and if you think he's the kind of man who tolerates tardiness...
...you are sadly mistaken.
You're a saint to wait for us.
-Hey. -Hello.
It's kind of between a townhouse and a brownstone.
We call it a "townstone."
Built in 1879. This is the middle of the house, the parlor floor.
Here is the living room. Formal dining is in the back.
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...
...which was renovated in '94 with all the expected amenities.
Sarah.
There are two bedroom floors above.
My God, it's amazing. Hey, kid. No scooter.
I don't have to tell you this amount of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.
It's got a yard. Sort of.
It is in a bit of disarray, but then again, 21-foot lot, 53 deep.
It allows for an expansive garden.
Working elevator.
The previous owner was disabled the last years of his life.
Highly unusual, the elevator.
You will not find this in 90 percent of brownstones.
Perhaps it's something of a fixer-upper, but we anticipate enormous interest.
It's a very emotional property.
Shall we have a look at the rest?
You should make an offer immediately.
Can I see it first?
There is nothing like this on the market right now.
You can't move from Greenwich to the Upper West Side...
...and expect to still have a house, a yard and a dog and cat, but here it is.
It's got everything you told me you wanted and more.
You'll have another family. You could have two.
It's a fortune.
Mom, it's not Barneys. You don't have to pay the price on the tag.
He can afford it.
It would be so lovely if I could show the property before I leave.
Hardwood floors throughout, as many as six working fireplaces.
This is the top floor. Two bedrooms. One at either end.
They share one small bath.
Originally, this would have been the servants' quarters.
The previous owner kept a small nursing staff.
I don't know if you have live-in help.
No, it's just the two of us.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den or what have you.
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine, the financier.
May I ask what you do, Mrs....
Altman.
Actually, I'm going back to school. Columbia.
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals.
I didn't realize you were Stephen Altman's wife.
Yes, until recently.
Master bath.
Pearlstine's been in all the papers since he died.
His kids are suing each other over the estate.
He was a recluse. Rich, paranoid.
Now they can't find half his money.
I hardly see how gossip is germane to showing the property.
Stop calling it "the property." It sounds ridiculous.
Walk-in closet.
Could the little one please stop that?
Kid, no elevator!
And we emerge in the master suite.
That's strange.
What?
Is this room smaller than it should be?
You're the first person to notice.
On caravan, no one from our office had the slightest idea.
It's called a panic room.
-What? -A safe room.
-A castle keep in medieval times. -I've read about these.
They're in vogue in high-end construction.
One can't be too careful about home invasion.
This is perfect.
The alarm goes off in the middle of the night.
What will you do? Call the police and wait till Tuesday?
Traipse downstairs in your underthings to check it out? I think not.
Concrete walls. Buried phone line, not connected to the house's main line.
Call the police, nobody can cut you off. You have your own ventilation system.
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers nearly every corner of the house.
This whole thing makes me nervous.
Why?
Ever read any Poe?
No, but I loved her last album.
What's to keep somebody from prying open the door?
Steel.
Thick steel. Very thick steel.
Full battery backup, so even if the power's out...
...it's still functional.
Oh, my God. Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he?
Open it, please.
And with kids like he's apparently got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
Please open the door.
That is highly inappropriate.
Open the door, please.
My room. Definitely my room.
This is really dangerous.
-That door is a hazard. -Not at all.
Motion detector, like an elevator.
The door won't close if it's blocked. There's another one at your ankles.
It couldn't be safer.
I know they'll take asking price.
It's working. I hooked up the phone!
Good for you, Mom. Hooked up a phone.
579 what?
3000.
Patsy's Pizza. Please hold.
Hey. Enough.
Mind the pizza?
What do you mean?
Our first night. I should've thought of something special.
I like pizza.
Fuck him.
Don't.
Fuck her, too.
I agree.
But don't.
Don't you think this place has way too many stairs?
You didn't carry anything up them.
You never asked what I thought of this house.
I didn't want you to tell me you hated it.
-I liked our old house. -Well, so did I.
You know what I was thinking?
I was thinking we could stencil the whole bookcase.
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.
Go ahead.
Oh, damn.
I forgot to set up that tour of your new school.
Dad already did it. I'm going with him on Sunday.
Oh, yeah?
So I'll take a cab and meet him there.
Is that what he said?
Isn't that what's so great about Manhattan?
You don't have to drive me everywhere?
I'll ride with you.
Why'd you bring me here if I can't go anywhere on my own?
That's it. I quit.
I'm not fighting with you till tomorrow.
Come here.
It's disgusting how much I love you.
Tell me about it.
-Mom? -Yeah.
It's too dark.
Better?
That's better.
"Bypass non-ready zone."
"Bypass non-ready zone."
"Shunt. Enter."
"Bypass non-ready zone."
"Shunt."
"Enter zone number."
"Shunt again."
In the morning I got to figure out how to turn this thing off.
Go, go back.
Do it.
Come on. Come on. Jesus fucking Christ.
Amateur.
We got a problem! We need to talk!
It's about time. I'm freezing my tits off out there.
-Who is that? -This is Raoul.
Who the fuck is Raoul?
Raoul is okay. Raoul has experience.
-Where'd you get him? -Through some people.
Open the fucking door.
-Hey. -No shit.
What is this?
There's a girl on the top floor, a woman on the third. They're asleep.
They're not supposed to be here.
-This is your department, Junior! -They are not supposed to be here!
Videotape. We're on videotape.
We've been on videotape since we got here and the tapes are upstairs.
-14-day escrow. -You fucked me!
14-day escrow! That's almost three weeks! They should not be in for another week!
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?
Business days. Escrow is always business days.
Five-day weeks always!
Right?
I'm out of here.
Just wait a minute. Wait a minute!
We can handle this. Can we still handle this?
It's just a woman and a kid?
-Unless Daddy comes home. -He's not.
They're divorcing. Daddy's banging some B model on the Upper East Side.
It's just her and the kid!
Now, can we do this?
Yeah, we can do it. Not with people here. And not with me.
Not with people here. And not with me.
-Wait! Twenty minutes! -She'll call the police.
They'll be here before I unpack my bags.
So we keep an eye on her.
Raoul can totally administrate that part.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that! He's not even supposed to be here!
Nobody gets hurt.
What about us? What if she has a gun?
Who are you?
I'm Raoul.
You know we can't do this without you!
This is still a good plan.
Fuck that! This is a great plan. It's just got a slight twist.
Yeah.
Felony kidnapping. Thirty years.
You make a lot of promises, don't you? You promise me, you promise your kids.
No family.
You're right. It's all fucked up. I fucked it up!
It's not how it's supposed to be.
But the fact of the matter is there's still $3,000,000 in this house...
...and no one but you and I even knows it's here.
Hey, I want that money. I want it!
But you...
...you need that money.
Or have you forgotten why you're here?
So let's quit dicking around, okay, and get this over with.
Kill the phones.
Top floor, little girl. I've got the mother. Give me that!
You stay here! Nobody gets past!
Wake up! Sarah!
Get up!
What did you do that for?
Where are you going?
-What's going on? -People. In the house.
They're in the elevator, heading down.
Fuck! They're coming down to you!
I told you. I don't hurt people.
They're going downstairs.
-That room. -What?
The panic room.
No, press emergency stop.
Fuck!
Coming back up!
That's you.
Shit.
Go!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Damn it! Mother--
Shit!
That's seven years' bad luck.
Shit.
Tell me they're not in there.
Oh, damn.
-It doesn't work? -It's a different phone line.
I never hooked it up.
Now what?
I can't hear a thing.
What do you think they want?
I don't know. Rob us....
I don't know.
What do we do?
We wait.
-What if they get in here? -Well, they can't.
They can't get in. It's not possible.
Mom. I heard you.
-Do you feel okay? -Yeah.
-You shaky? -No.
-Chills? -No.
Please. Don't worry about me.
He's got kids. What do you think he'll do?
Hang out while the cops waltz in? Use your head.
Here he comes.
I locked the roof access. She's not getting down from there.
-Good. -She could be in there calling the cops.
Could she have hooked it up today? No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.
No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.
She would've had to do it through Manhattan Security, my company.
I checked the paperwork and the phone is not connected.
You see? She couldn't have.
-I thought she wouldn't be here. -He said she wouldn't.
Fuck you! And fuck you! She is not supposed--
Do it.
Excuse me.
The police are on their way.
-She's lying. -You're full of--
It's not an intercom. It's a PA system.
I know. I'm just scaring her.
I suggest you leave before they get here.
-What? -He's saying that we don't have a phone.
How could he know that?
Take what you want and get out!
If only it were that easy.
Some paper. I need some paper. Give me some paper.
Hey, Zorro! You going to help us out?
You got a piece of paper?
-What is he doing? -I don't know.
"What we want is in that room"?
They're coming in here, aren't they?
No, no. I told you. They can't get in here.
What do you know about this room?
What do we know about that room?
-Let's not tell her anything. -Just a few details.
We're not coming out, and we're not letting you in!
Get out of my house!
-Say "fuck." -You fuck.
-Mom. -What?
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Get the fuck out of my house!
Okay, I have an idea.
She's a woman. Women need security.
She won't believe you.
She needs to know she's dealing with decent people and she can trust us.
Conversation's over!
What? She's not coming down?
Shut up. Will you please shut up and let me think?
Like that'll help you think.
You know what? Fine! You think!
-What if she did call the cops? -She didn't.
She said it again, that she called the cops.
If cops were coming, do you think I'd still be here?
Okay, fine. Good, excellent. We all believe you.
How do we get into that room?
What is funny about this?
Is this shit funny to you?
I spent the last 12 years building these rooms...
...to keep out people like us.
It's all so ironic and amusing, okay? Now, how do we get in?
We can't.
You can't get in the panic room.
That's the whole point. We have to get her to come out.
And why would she do that?
I don't know.
But when she does, she can't get out of this house.
We keep her here, we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...
...and I don't want any help from Joe Pesci over here.
They want to hole up in this house? Fine.
We make it impossible for them to leave.
And why would they come out in the first place?
I'm working on that.
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
Small space?
I'm okay.
-You can't wig out. -I know.
-I mean it. -I won't.
You know, people never get buried alive anymore.
I guess it used to happen all the time.
Really?
Yeah, I read that.
And when did this happen all the time?
Twenty, thirty years ago.
What are they doing now?
I don't know.
They're locking us in.
This is not happening.
Sarah, calm down.
You know what could happen if you let yourself get worked up.
Sarah!
-What the hell are you doing? -We're coming in from below.
No, you're not. Even if you got through the concrete, there's steel.
You won't even make a dent.
We'll see.
Hey. This is what I do.
If some idiot with a sledgehammer could break in...
...do you really think that I would still have a job?
Don't get that in your eye.
Neighbor.
Help!
Please help us!
-Call the police! -Do you hear us?
Help us!
Help!
-Help us, please! -Call the police!
Shit!
You guys just going to stand there?
Why? What do you got, MacGyver?
He can't get in here with a hammer, can he?
Could you be any louder?
Give me a hand with those boxes.
Listen, goddamn it!
I'm in charge here. Now, what the hell is going on?
-They're going to get in here. -No, they can't get in here.
We're going to be fine. We'll be just fine.
Oh, this is good.
This could work.
I was just thinking that we should do something like this.
-Open it. -I just did.
Open it some more.
We're just sending them a message.
They'll get the point.
Honey, get down on the ground.
Quit dicking around and open this fucking thing up.
-Don't be stupid. -Quiet!
We're trying to scare them, not kill them.
What is it?
It's bad.
They're coughing.
If they're coughing, they're going to die!
Nobody is going to die, man!
Will you please have the balls to follow through with something?
Mom.
The worst that'll happen is they'll pass out. They'll have a hangover.
How are we going to get in there if they pass out, Junior?
Cut it back a little.
They won't pass out, numb-nuts. They'll throw up first.
We can't get in if they're dead!
Stay on the ground and breathe.
Turn it down.
Turn it down! It's too much! -Don't you start up with this shit. -Keep it down!
-Don't you start up with this shit. -Keep it down!
I'm turning it down.
-Keep his ass off of me. -I'm not killing anybody.
-Tell him to turn it down! -Turn the shit off.
-No. -Turn it down.
-Mom? -Just a second.
Mom.
Get under this.
Oh, my God.
-Fucking amateurs, man! -It's my fucking idea.
Shut the fuck up! There are people trying to sleep over there.
What is that?
Turn the gas off.
Turn the gas off right now.
Get back!
Shit!
God!
Get it off me!
It's okay.
You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch! I'm coming in there!
Calm the fuck down.
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
Promise me you'll never do anything like that.
I won't.
They're moving. At least they're still moving in there.
What?
Talk to him.
Please, man, give it a rest.
-That Morse code? -SOS.
Where'd you learn that?
Titanic.
We got to talk. Downstairs.
No, no, no. Not you.
Come on, come on, come on.
Get up.
Come on.
Wake up.
The first thing I'm going to do this morning is call my plastic surgeon.
There's been a change here. $100,000 is not enough. Not for this shit.
I want a third of whatever's in that room up there.
Fine!
Okay? Full share, one-third. Congratulations.
You bought a ski mask, made $1,000,000. Your parents will be proud.
Got him.
Let me straighten out something else. Get control of your goddamn expert.
I'm not losing my half of the money because--
Slow down. Half?
Did you sleep through grade school? Five seconds ago, it was a third....
Come on.
I'm letting you know he's a problem.
But this wasn't my idea, so he's your problem.
You're right. It wasn't your idea!
None of this was your idea! It was my idea!
Come on, look over here.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Let's hope this guy's an ex-Boy Scout.
-We're here! -Help us!
We're over here!
Help! Open your window!
Help!
We're never going to get out of here.
I'm the loving grandson who put in the time with the old man...
...every goddamn weekend for two years...
...talking to him, dressing him, walking him, feeding him.
Are you done?
No. I'm the one the old man finally told about the safe.
I'm the one who found the guy who built it, and I convinced him to break into it!
Wait a minute.
-What? -The bedroom's empty. Where are they?
Two of them, on the stairs.
Where's the third guy?
I left my cell phone by the bed.
I earned that money.
I will not let you jeopardize my fucking plan...
...because you have a problem relating to others!
Got it?
If I don't come back, close this door.
-Mom. -Just do what I say.
If he touches me again, I'll shoot him.
Christ!
Wait!
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle, or can we get back to work?
Don't take no tone with me, jerk-wad.
I'll shove it up your ass and snap it off.
You're a bus driver, Raoul.
You live in Flatbush.
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard bullshit you just heard...
...because I saw that movie, too.
What is this?
I got some news for you.
Go.
Go!
Fuck!
She got something. What did she get?
No.
Charger!
She has a cell phone.
No!
All right, signal.
Come on. Signal.
I don't think they'll be talking on no cell phone from in there.
-Why not? -You can't call out from in there.
No signal.
I didn't hook up this line, but I hooked up the main line.
If we can find it, we can cut into it.
I can't go to prison, man. I'm not built for that shit.
Be careful.
Get the phone.
-It doesn't come off. -Rip it off!
Screwdriver. Phillips.
Junior, when I asked you to cut the phone lines, did you cut the main line?
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone in the kitchen?
Shit!
Strip this and expose the wires.
-What are we doing? -I have no idea.
-Okay, got it? -Yeah. Here.
Okay.
Yellow, yellow.
Okay.
Dial tone.
911 Emergency.
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street--
-Please hold. -No, no. God.
Call Dad.
How do you live in New York and not have a single Percocet?
-Hello? -Stephen. Put Stephen on the line.
-Who is this? -It's Meg.
Do you know what time it is?
-Put him on the phone, bitch. -It's your fucking wife.
Move.
-Hello? -You've got to help us.
Move!
There are three men upstairs. They broke in--
What--
-He'll do something. -No, he won't.
He'll call the police.
You don't know her. She won't let him.
No. He knows that there's trouble. He heard me.
He's across the park. That's why we got houses close to each other.
Just in case we needed each other. He'll help us.
-He won't. -Yes, he will!
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
Why?
I was trying not to tell you.
What?
I'm dizzy and hungry.
All she's got is NyQuil and fucking Midol.
Looks like that gas idea didn't work out so well.
Whose fault was that?
This is impossible.
What's the plan now, hot rod?
This is worse than impossible. This is unpleasant.
Here, drink this. All right, drink lots of water.
You dropped to the low 40s. We have to get your blood-sugar up.
Can you hear me okay?
I'm just dizzy, not deaf.
Great. Smart-ass. That's excellent.
Did you see anything in here? Any candy bars or something sweet?
Let's check it again.
Mom, I did it.
We got to stay calm, okay?
If we stay calm, everything will be fine. All right? Stay calm.
You're making me nervous.
I'm sorry.
What if I keep dropping?
You won't. I'll figure something out.
You know, he's right.
There's no way we're getting into that room.
What are you talking about?
I just got to be honest with myself here.
I don't need to be involved...
...with anything so harrowing or perilous at this point in my life.
-You're giving up? -Hell, yes.
I don't need the fucking aggravation. I'll make an anonymous phone call.
They'll find the floor safe. I'll inherit.
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.
Fuck, I'll still put away 800 or 900 grand and keep my goddamn hair.
Take it. Go out and get loaded.
Wait a minute.
Say what you just said again.
Say that shit about the money again, babycakes.
When? Before?
Yeah, before.
Splitting the money in your head, you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand.
What are you doing?
That was after tax, which makes it more than a million and a half gross.
So now you're a tax attorney.
-I'm out of here. -Wait a minute.
There's sugar in everything. Places you'd never expect. Like ketchup.
Where else?
Travel kit.
Plus, you named eight people you got to split it with...
...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks in the safe.
A fuckup like you has got to get less than everybody else...
...so now I don't know what to think.
You're adding up money you'll never touch, buddy.
How much is in there?
Mouthwash.
Saccharin.
Hey, I'm talking to you. Answer me.
Fine. There's more.
And when were you going to tell us this minor economic detail?
It doesn't matter now. It's totally fucking moot!
-Why are we having this conversation? -What were you thinking?
How did you expect to get away with this?
Did you think that I'd open that safe...
...and then me and Raoul would wait while you picked out your share?
What's the matter with you?
You got us into this mess, and you were going to fuck us?
You got yourself into this. You got the custody lawyers up your ass.
Your eyes were huge when I told you about the gig...
...so don't play innocent.
Things didn't work out.
Play past it.
Mints? Sugar-free.
I'm opening that safe. You leave, you get nothing.
It's looking doubtful there, big guy.
I will split the money with Raoul. But I don't ever want to see you again.
Cops show up on my doorstep, we will know who sent them...
...and we will fucking find you.
I'll see you, Burnham.
Later, Raoul.
Mom!
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street a couple of times...
...think you know all about it.
You don't know nothing about me.
Sarah, listen to me.
Go to the corner. Shut your eyes and don't turn around.
Okay.
You should see the look on your face.
What's happening?
-Don't move. Don't you fucking move. -No, don't.
Come here.
Come here.
-Don't shoot, please. -Come on.
Shut it, lock it and get the fuck away from it.
-Stop it, you fucking-- -Fucking what?
Clown? Idiot? Fucking asshole?
Who's the clown now?
Me.
That's right. It's burning me.
Who's got the gun?
You.
Remember that.
Find out who the fuck that is.
Give me your wallet.
Give me your wallet.
Stephen Altman.
Did your wife give you a call, Stephen?
What did she say?
Don't know. Cut off.
-Phones are dead. -Did you call anybody else?
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephen?
No.
He's telling the truth.
Yeah.
Yeah, he probably is.
Because when I do this, people don't lie.
What?
-What do you want? -Get us into that room.
-What do you want? -Get us into that room. -I can't. -Yeah, you can.
-I can't. -Yeah, you can.
You're full of ideas. You just got to squeeze one out.
You want me to just make something up?
You've got till the count of three.
Then you end up like Junior over there.
-One, squeeze. -This is ridiculous.
Two, squeeze.
I don't know what to tell you.
-Three. -Wait!
Okay.
I got an idea.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Help!, Rubber Soul...
...Yesterday and Today, Magical Mystery Tour, the White Album....
Stay warm, baby. Stay warm, all right?
Let It Be, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper....
Oh, God!
Dad?
No, no.
Take it easy.
Open the door! Open the door!
-Meg. -No.
Don't open the door!
-Just make it look good. -Don't you tell me what--
Open the door!
Don't! Don't open--
Knock it off!
You kill him, they'll never open that door.
Oh, God.
All right. Lie down. Lie down.
Lie down.
All right.
You'll be fine. Come on.
He's fucking crazy.
Get your hands off him, you frightening hillbilly motherfucker!
You're a strong girl.
You be strong. Be strong, sweetheart.
Get the fuck off him, now! Just get off him!
It's almost over.
Yeah, that's it. That's it.
Okay. All right, turn around.
I'll be right back. I'll be right back.
It's got blood on it. You might want to wear it inside out.
Get your tapes.
Who's this?
It's her kid.
What happened to her?
Who gives a fuck?
Hurry up. Get your stuff.
Hey, lady.
Mom?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
We've got your kid.
Come down here.
Let's get this over with.
Get her, get her!
Shit!
What is it? No! Let her out!
-Where's your gun? Where's your gun? -Open the door.
No!
-Where's your gun? -I don't know.
Open up!
Open it.
Shut up! Listen to me. She's got your gun.
She's got your gun!
Stop screaming. Stop it.
I know you've got the gun.
Put the gun down and step away from the door.
You got to open the door. My daughter is very sick.
She needs an injection.
Do you hear me?
Open the door so I can give her a shot.
Or I swear to God, I'll kill you both.
If I open the door, you'll shoot us.
So give her the shot yourself.
Give her the shot!
Do you need this?
Can you do this yourself?
What happens if you don't get it?
Coma.
Die.
Fuck! Open it.
Put the gun on the floor. And go all the way downstairs.
And I'll give her the shot, all right?
I told you to leave the gun!
Shit.
You fucking bitch!
If you pull any shit like that again, I will fucking kill her.
Do you hear me?
If you step outside, I'll kill her!
If I see a uniform inside this house, I'll cut her fucking throat!
Do you understand?
Yes.
But please, just give her the shot.
Please.
Please.
Don't fucking do it.
While we're in here, she'll call the cops.
Are you going to open the safe?
Don't you look at me.
All I know about this is what I see on TV.
You got to talk me through this.
This right here?
It's this?
Yeah, okay.
Nice house you guys got.
Your mom's rich.
Dad's rich. Mom's just mad.
Tap it.
I wish I could have put my kid in a place like this.
It's not that I didn't try.
Sometimes things, they don't work out the way you want them to.
Done.
Wasn't supposed to be like this.
He had it all worked out.
Nobody was supposed to even be here.
Thanks...
...Burnham.
Wasn't supposed to be like this.
She's going to be okay.
I gave her the shot. She's all right.
It'll be over soon.
Stephen.
Oh, my God.
Can you move?
Not much. I think my arm is broken.
Raise your arm.
Come on, raise your arm.
Try again.
Come on. Try again.
Meg, please don't do anything stupid.
They're going to kill us.
Just do everything they ask. It'll be okay that way.
Stephen, they'll kill her.
Holy shit. She called the goddamn cops.
The police.
You called the police?
Of course I called them.
You scared the shit out of me.
She killed the kid.
She just killed her own kid.
All right, take this.
Don't say a word.
No, her husband must have called them.
Foreign son of a bitch. I told you!
Where is she?
There.
What the fuck's she doing?
She's going to handle it.
I'm just trying to unlock....
-Is everything okay? -You all right, ma'am?
What are you.... What time is it?
It's a little after 4:00 a.m.
We got a call, ma'am.
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
What do you want?
-We'd like to come in. -No, you can't come in.
Ma'am, you sure you're all right?
I'm fine.
Ma'am, you don't look so good.
Well, you don't look so hot yourself, Officer Keeney.
Come on, I'm freezing out here.
"There are three."
What?
Your husband said you called for help.
That you said, "There are three," right before you got cut off.
Oh, that phone call.
And your neighbors...
...called in about some loud shouts or a loudspeaker of some kind?
That was the TV. It's off now.
Can I just ask you one question?
What was the end of that sentence?
When you said, "There are three"...
...what was the rest?
Look....
My husband and I just split up...
...and it's my first night in a new house...
...and I admit I was a little drunk.
And the sentence, if you insist on knowing...
...was going to be:
"There are three things that I'll do for you if you come jump into bed with me."
Thank God I came to my senses before I said all that, and I hung up...
...so nobody would ever have to know what I was thinking.
Unless, of course...
...two policemen came in the middle of the night and interrogated me.
So, Rick, you want to go?
Or do you want her to tell you which three things?
All right.
Ma'am...
...if there's something you want to say to us...
...but maybe you can't say it right now...
...you might want to make some kind of a signal...
...by blinking your eyes a few times.
Something like that.
That's something you could do safely.
Man...
...you guys are good.
You mean, like if there was somebody in the house or something?
They really train you guys.
No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Cross my heart.
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.
Night, ma'am.
This kid has seen my face.
Yeah, well, that's not my problem.
Yeah, it is. You're here with me.
You're on the hook, too.
Do one. Same price for the rest.
Stay the fuck away from me.
You know how this is going to end.
Goddamn!
What's up?
Why the hell didn't we do that?
What's she doing? What the fuck does she think she's doing?
She's got your gun. Who told you to bring a gun?
Just let me drill, man.
Empty?
Come on, man.
Bearer bonds.
One second.
Two, three, four, five....
Meg. Why are we doing this?
Because it's going to come to that.
There's 22.
$22 million.
That lying little shit!
Let's get out of here.
Lift.
Leave that. Christ, I'll buy you new tools.
You'll be okay.
It's glass. I got you. Come on.
Hurry up.
Watch the glass.
Get down here.
Wait.
Wait. You don't want to do that.
Dad, don't shoot him!
Let my daughter go.
We're finished. Your daughter's fine.
We'll go out the back door. You'll never see us again.
Let her go.
Okay.
It's okay.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Just let her go. Let her go.
Just let her go. Let her go. Let go of her!
Put that gun down.
-Sarah, come here. -Put that gun down!
-Sarah, come here. -Put that gun down! -Do as I say. -Don't be crazy, man.
-Do as I say. -Don't be crazy, man.
-Just let her go. -Let her go!
-Are you okay? -Yes.
-Did they hurt you? -No.
-Did they touch you? -No.
Stephen, shoot him. Shoot him!
Get off her!
You'll be okay now.
-Police! -Don't move!
-Nobody move! -Everybody on the ground!
Team two, upstairs. Team three, down.
Are you okay?
Are you all right?
Freeze! Don't move, motherfucker!
Don't move! I will kill you!
Move away from the wall!
Get off the fence! Move!
Put your hands in the air!
It'll be okay. It's fine, Dad.
Is there anybody else in the house?
No.
Central, I need a bus at 38 West 94th.
It's okay. I'm all right.
I want to see the palms of your hands!
Do you hear me? Open your hands!
Dad, it's okay. You're going to be fine.
Everything is going to be fine.
This sounds interesting.

He ruled a large and mighty kingdom. Yet he was sad, -
- for he was growing old, and had no child to inherit the throne.
Then, happily, a daughter was born. A princess.
And she was given the name Odette.
Kings and queens came from all around to offer gifts.
Among them was the widow Uberta and her son, Prince Derek.
Then William and Uberta happened upon the same idea:
If the children spent each summer together they might fall in love, -
- and join their kingdoms forever.
But unknown to all was the plan of the evil enchanter, Rothbart.
Odette's birth was of little concern to him.
He was preparing to take William's kingdom using the forbidden arts.
On the eve of his assault William attacked, -
- and Rothbart's powers were plunged into darkness.
Despite calls for his death, the enchanter was only banished.
I'm not finished with you yet. Someday I'll get my power back.
And then everything you own, and everything you love, will be mine!
Many feared King William was too kind.
But in time, the threat was forgotten.
All hopes turned to that summer -
- when Derek and Odette would meet.
Here they come!
Dear Uberta! As lovely as ever!
A nest!
And who might this young man be? Young Prince Derek, no doubt.
Welcome to our fair kingdom.
And to you, young princess.
Go on, Derek dear! Go on ... Derek!
Hello, Princess Odette. I'm very pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you, Prince Derek!
now I'm stuck with her all summer she can't wrestle, hunt or box
- he's conceited - what a total bummer
- I'll be lucky to get chickenpox - so happy you could come
- so happy to be here - how I'd like to run!
this is not my idea of fun
they seem to get along nicely
we'll join our lands if this clicks
that's my point precisely
- good parenting - and politics
- so happy we agree - I think it's a deal
- Derek's quite a catch - this is my idea of a match
And such fun.
good heavens, child, don't dawdle we can't keep Derek waiting
I haven't packed and Father, I get seasick
they soon will be arriving is that respect you're showing?
if I have to kiss her hand again I'm gonna be sick
one day Prince Derek will be her intended
splendid!
we tried all summer but we can't lose her
- Wait up! - Quick!
when picking teams I'd never choose her
can't she read?
- this isn't fair - we don't care
- It's all or none - this is not my idea of fun
long before they met Derek and Odette
were destined to be wedded
- however anyone could see - the only thing they could agree
was that the very thought of summer was dreaded
she tries to make me dress up she flirts with the castle guards
- don't you really sort of like her? - only if she'd lose at cards
- four sevens and a ten - I win again
every time she's won
- this is my idea of fun - this isn't my idea of fun
we need a royal wedding I'd love to be invited
at least we'd get a holiday to rest our plows and axes
someday these two will marry two lands will be united
and with luck their marriage may result in lower taxes
- what if she dislikes the merger? - urge her
for as long as I remember we've been told we'd someday wed
every June until September
- all their annoying hints - bruises from their fingerprints
- I could do better, I'm sure - he's so immature
I see him smiling and my knees start buckling
I see inside him and my doubts are gone
she started out as such an ugly duckling
and somehow suddenly became a swan
- so happy to be here - till now I never knew
it is you I've been dreaming of
- this is my idea ... - this is my idea ...
what a good idea such a romantic notion
this is my idea, such a good idea such a powerful and magic potion
this is exactly my idea
this is exactly my idea of love
this is my idea ...
this is my idea ...
this is my idea
this is my idea of love .
Arrange the marriage!
Wait!
What? You're all I ever wanted. You're beautiful.
- Thank you. But what else? - What else?
Is beauty all that matters to you?
- Derek? What else? - I ... uh ...
What else is there?
We tried, Uberta. No one can say we didn't try.
- Say goodbye, Odette. - Goodbye ... Prince Derek.
Mother! Goodbye, Princess.
All these years of planning ... wasted!
She says, "Is beauty all that matters?"
- And you say, "What else is there?" - It was dumb, I know.
You should write a book: "How to Offend Women."
- Your turn, Prince Derek. - I didn't know what else to say.
- You lost your queen. - That's twice today.
Think! You must see more than her beauty.
I do, Rogers. She's like ...
... you know ... and how about ...
I mean, right?
I don't know how to say it.
I'll prove it to her. I'll prove my love. Checkmate!
Today's the day.
Everything you own, everything you love, will be mine!
I just don't understand. What else did you want him to say?
I need to know that he loves me for myself.
Stay inside, Odette.
- It's King William's captain. - We ...
We were attacked ... A great animal.
- Odette! - Derek, wait!
Odette! Odette?
Odette?
King William ... Who did this?
- It was so quick. A great animal. - Where is Odette?
Listen to me, Derek. It's not what it seems.
- What's not? Where is Odette? - Odette is ...
Odette is ... gone.
Odette!
Don't let my spell make you sad, it doesn't even last the whole day.
As soon as the moon comes up ...
That's how it works every night.
When the moonlight on the lake touches your wings ...
This doesn't give me any pleasure. Well, maybe a teensy bit ...
But what I really want is your father's kingdom.
- Take it then. You have the power. - I've tried that.
When you steal something, you have to fight to keep it.
But if I married the only heir to the throne ...
... we'll rule your father's kingdom together, legally. King and queen.
- Never! - Where are you going?
As soon as the moonlight leaves the lake, you turn back into a swan.
- The musicians are not happy. - I know, but I have to practice.
I'm sure it'll be loads of ... fun.
- That animal won't give up easily. - You don't think she's alive?
- When I find it, I'll find Odette. - But you've looked everywhere.
- All the kingdom knows she's gone. - All the kingdom is wrong.
She's alive, and I will find her. Ready, Brom?
No peeking. Animals, assemble!
I must object! We are musicians.
Well, the servants are off today.
- But I'm an artist, not a boar! - You could have fooled me.
Come on, guys. They're harmless.
we are a band not a band of animals
this masquerade is more than I can bear
there goes my reputation such awful humiliation
and I've the lion's share
Down on all fours, and growl ferociously!
Liven it up a bit!
I want you to strike fear into my heart!
Not you, Wesley. You're a rabbit, for heaven's sake.
Archers! Ready!
Set.
Go!
- Duck! - Yes?
- Duck! - What?
Day after day, all he ever does
is practice, practice, practice
thinking of her and the way it was
practice, practice, practice
he's not happy till he has attacked us
day after day all he ever does is practice
thinking of her and the way it was practice, practice, practice
if we'd refused he'd have sacked us practice, practice, practice .
Time! Animals, assemble for counting.
You scored plenty of five-pointers, that's for sure!
Sorry, Hans.
Moose are worth two points. 16 hits ... a total of 32.
Ten seven-pointers and fourteen three-pointers!
Ten seven-pointers and fourteen three-pointers! A total of 298! Well done, Derek! And for you, Bromley ...
A total of 298! Well done, Derek! And for you, Bromley ...
Zero ... and zero ... and nothing and nil and zip.
Last but not least, the elusive 100-point white rabbit ...
- I believe that's 300, Rogers. - Good shooting, Brom!
Well? Write it down. 300 to 298.
Wait just a moment, Rogers.
- Sorry, Brom! - You're a great marksman, Derek.
But it takes more than that. It takes courage. That's my forte.
How about a quick round of "Catch and Fire."
C ... c ... catch and fire? You mean me?
You're the only one with enough c ... c ... courage.
- Are you sure you're all right? - Yes, I'm fine.
- Too tight! - Oops! So sorry!
Ready?
He's ready.
Remember, aim for the heart. Right between the shoulders.
Oh, please!
Come on, Brom. Hold it steady.
Oh please ...
Now!
52 out of 52. Well done, Derek!
Extraordinary courage, man! Just think ...
One inch lower, and that arrow would have ...
Don't lose hope, Odette. Wherever you are, I'll find you.
Quiet!
You've come up with some dumb ideas, Jean-Bob, but this one is a doozy.
Go ahead and laugh! She'll kiss me. And when she does ...
And when she does, poof! You change into a prince. I know, you told me.
Why don't you just give her flowers?
What a love-dunce! I don't want these, I must have those .
When she learns that I have risked my life, the kissing will not stop.
Then you'll change into a prince?
- Mind if I point out a problem? - I don't listen to peasants.
Suit yourself.
Flowers, kiss, concentration! Flowers, kiss, concentration!
Just curious ... How are you gonna get back?
Hurry, hurry!
Move it! No, not that!
Close ...
Grab me! Hold my arm! Hold my leg!
Hold my ... hold it!
Thank you, Odette. Let me have that.
Silence, you savages!
- Are you all right, Jean-Bob? - Oui, oui, Odette.
- What were you trying to do? - He thought ...
- I was getting the flowers for you. - You're being sneaky again.
- You deserve a nice bouquet. - And you deserve a kiss.
All right. My kiss will break your spell.
- Give it up, Jean-Bob. - I can only kiss the man I love.
- And he must ... - Make a vow of everlasting love.
- And he must ... - Make a vow of everlasting love. - And prove it to the world. - What do you think I was doing?
- And prove it to the world. - What do you think I was doing?
- Speed, make him understand! - I'm only a turtle.
If I could break this spell I'd run to him today
and somehow I know he's on his way to me
Derek, you and I were meant to be
for longer than forever
I'll hold you in my heart
it's almost like you're here with me
although we're far apart
for longer than forever
as constant as a star
I close my eyes and I am where you are
sure as the dawn brings the sunrise we've an unshakable bond
destined to last for a lifetime and beyond
for longer than forever
I swear that I'll be true
I've made an everlasting vow
to find a way to you
for longer than forever
like no love ever known
and with your love I'll never be alone
for longer than forever
much stronger than forever
and with your love
I'll never be alone .
- Is he dead? - No, it's just his wing.
- A strange-looking bird. - He must be in a lot of pain.
- You'd better hold him. - Ready.
Hello! This is your wake-up call!
It takes more than two pond punks to keep Puffin down!
Wait. I'm your friend.
So why are you holding an arrow?
The exact kind of arrow I have ...
- I took it out while you lay there. - You mean you didn't ...
Madam, I apologize. My name is Lieutenant Puffin.
A pleasure, Lieutenant Puffin. I'm Princess Odette.
And these are my best friends. Mr. Lorenzo Trudgealong ...
- Friends call me Speed. - And Jean-Bob.
I have no friends, only servants. They call me "Your Highness."
He thinks he's a prince.
I owe you, Princess. I'll stay until my debt is paid.
- But he has me under a spell. - What? You mean a magical ..?
Your knight in shining armor has come to set you free.
- Let me at him! I'll ... - Chill!
All it takes is one little word. Will you marry me?
Every night you ask that question, and I give you the same answer:
- I'll die first. - You're really starting to bug me.
- Aren't you used to it by now? - Keep pushing it!
- But some day I'm gonna boil over! - I'll never give you the kingdom.
I was hoping you'd say you'd be mine.
It looks as if you need another day to think about it.
No ...
Princess?
Beautiful! Simply beautiful!
Soon Derek will be married, and we'll have a king again.
Derek refuses to be king, unless he finds Odette.
Poppycock! All that will change at tomorrow night's ball.
They're all coming to the ball. Every princess is coming.
You see, Rogers, one of these is bound to change his mind.
Absolutely ... not.
- Do not lose one. - Oh no, no!
- Do not lose one. - Oh no, no! Is Derek still working on the mystery of the fat animal?
Is Derek still working on the mystery of the fat animal?
- The great animal, Your Highness. - It's large and has fur.
Listen, Derek, it's not what it seems.
What did King William mean?
It's not what it seems ... Of course! It's not what it seems.
Now I'll find you, Odette!
They're coming, Derek! Where are you going?
- To find the great animal! - But be back tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night? - The ball!
Mother, I can't. Please, Mother. Don't do the lip thing.
If I leave now, maybe I can be back in time.
But please, Mother, not one of your beauty pageants.
It's just a few friends ... and their daughters.
This must be big. Every princess must have her own introduction.
- But Madam, you said ... - Forget that. Send for the cooks.
Tell the band to practice. And put four footmen on every carriage!
Maybe five.
Let me get it straight. When the moonlight leaves, you ...
And the next night, if I want to be human, I have to be on the lake.
And the next night, if I want to be human, I have to be on the lake. She just needs moonlight. I have to be smooched.
She just needs moonlight. I have to be smooched.
No fear! You fly to your prince, we bring him back to the lake, -
- the moon comes up, you become a princess, and ... happy ever after!
How will I find him? I don't even know where I am.
How will I find him? I don't even know where I am. - I bet he does. - That's a great idea!
- I bet he does. - That's a great idea!
"Monsieur Rothbart, could I borrow a map?"
"Monsieur Rothbart, could I borrow a map?" That's it! A map. Let's do it!
That's it! A map. Let's do it!
we're off on a mission we're tough, in good condition
there's danger around us they'd hurt us if they found us
we have all the courage we require
try your luck, our plan will fly no fear!
- It's hanging on the wall upstairs. - She'll be lookout. We get the map.
Do you mean "we"?
this plan if applied'll be simply suicidal
- you'll be a sitting duck - no fear!
suppose that I do this who knows if we'll live through this
our team is shy one green webbed-footed volunteer
- no way, Jose, no chance! - no choice, no fear!
No, stop it!
- Quickly! - Easy for you to say.
When I have to do something quick, I always bring a turtle.
I think I pulled a muscle.
I'm gonna die. I know it!
You're going to get us all killed.
we will take any dare the other side'll dare to dream up
we play tough, we play fair but we'll win because we'll team up
- Yikes. - Head for the door.
Okay, Jean-Bob goes deep. Speed gets the hand-off.
Ready? Break!
I'm open, I'm open.
Get that map!
Saved you!
Reach!
Hey batter, batter, batter.
The crowd's going wild!
no fear
no fear if only one of us knew how to steer!
- get a grip - get set
that's our best bet no brakes , no sweat!
- we're dead - not yet!
Save me!
no fear
There's Derek's kingdom. When do we leave?
- It's a mouse. - The great animal.
A tad small, wouldn't you say?
Yes, until it changes into this.
An animal that can change its shape. A harmless creature approaches, -
- then suddenly it's too late.
- You mean it could be anything? - Anything!
Odette, I apologize for the way I've been acting.
Derek is very important to you, and I'm just thinking of myself.
- Everyone does that. - Don't make this more difficult.
Accept my apology, please! Now we can kiss and make up.
- Jean-Bob! - What did I say?
- Jean-Bob! - What did I say? Attention! It is zero hour, troops. Odette, prepare for takeoff.
Attention! It is zero hour, troops. Odette, prepare for takeoff.
- Is everyone ready? - Ready for action, sir!
How about you, Jean-Bob? Jean-Bob ..?
- Highness! - Oui , I am ready.
Good luck. Have a nice flight!
If anything happens to her, I'll have you whipped, flogged, -
- put on the rack, and then have your back legs fried in butter!
- He's in here, Brom. I can feel it. - How will you recognize it?
I'll know. Better stay close.
If you say so.
Derek? Where are you?
Sorry.
Derek?
Derek!
- We'd better watch out for hunters. - At ease, Odette.
I can smell a human a mile away.
- Where did that come from? - Derek! He's here.
You will not lose control. Follow the plan as outlined.
You will not lose control. Follow the plan as outlined. Acknowledge!
Odette?
I've got you now. Don't give me that innocent look.
Change! Go ahead, change! I'm not afraid of you.
Derek.
A swan? A swan!
Of course. It's not what it seems.
Just a little closer. Come on ... come on.
- Derek ... - This one's for Odette!
That was close! It's working, here he comes.
Slow down! You're going to lose him.
- Slow down! - He's too close.
Too close? He can't even see us ... Speed up, girl!
- That boy of yours can move. - He's faster than you thought.
Don't worry, Odette. I've been taught what to do in this situation.
When you're in the archer's sights, fly into the sun, use its light.
What did I tell you? All we have to do is stay in the sun.
All right, don't panic!
Puffin! Into the trees!
If we don't think of something quick, we're dead ducks.
Remember what the possum said: If there's no escape, play dead.
Gives it the right touch. Wait till I give you a ...
That'll put some distance between us.
- No sign of them yet. - I hope he knows what he's doing.
There they are!
It's almost time. Look!
I can't do it. He'll kill me, Puffin.
If you don't do it now, you've lost your chance.
All right. I'll do it.
- What? - Come on, come on.
Got you!
Hello, Derek.
- Derek, I've missed you so. - No one believed me.
- You can't stay. - Can't stay? I'll never let you go.
- Derek ... Oh, no! - Who is it? What's going on?
It's him. He has me under a spell.
- Let him come! - No, you must go!
- Then you're coming with me. - But I'll turn back into a swan.
- Derek, you must trust me. Go! - There must be a way to break it.
- You must vow everlasting love. - I do! It's all I've ever wanted.
You must prove it to the world. I don't know how.
Go!
The ball. Tomorrow night, come to the castle.
Before the whole world, I will make a vow of everlasting love.
- Odette! - I'm coming. Go!
- Tomorrow night! - Tomorrow night. Now go!
Odette! Didn't you hear me calling?
- I ... - I thought I heard voices.
- Odette, Odette. - Voices?
Yes, voices. What?
I've decided to be your queen.
You mean ..? Odette, you've made me so happy!
I'll be a good king. I'll wear nice clothes, and trim my beard.
You've made me so happy, Odette.
By the way, you wouldn't know who this belongs to?
"Come to the ball.
I will make a vow of everlasting love."
You thought you could fool Rothbart?
I will never be yours, you creature!
- I will marry Prince Derek. - I hate to tell you this, Odette.
But you won't be able to attend the big ball tomorrow night.
If you want to stop me, you'll have to kill me.
I don't think so. You've forgotten something very important.
Tomorrow night there is no moon.
Whatever they do, I'm one step ahead.
On the other hand, Prince Derek's vow could ruin everything.
I'm going to have to deal with him. But how?
The vow! I'll get him to offer his vow to the wrong princess.
That's it. I'll make you look like Odette.
It'll take a lot of work, but it'll be worth it.
Because when he makes his vow to the wrong girl, Odette will die.
Then I'll finish Derek off myself.
I love it! This is really classy! This is me!
it's such a hoot to see them quaking
when I'm king they'll treat me with respect
I can't wait to watch their poor hearts breaking
so much for politically correct
up till now I've pulled my punches I intend to eat their lunches
no more Mr. Nice Guy not for me
if you think that I'm hard - hearted
well lamby pie, I haven't even started
no more Mr. Nice Guy no sir-ee!
as soon as my witchcraft has zinged 'em
I'll gain control of the kingdom
as for Odette, well that's tragic
'cause I'm going back to that old black magic
good behavior, it's so much duller
time to show my one true color
Mr. Nice Guy is history
vengeance is what I believe in
I don't get mad, I get even
Odette can't go to the ball I won't bring her
I'll zap up a date who's a real dead ringer
up to no good, I love plotting
'cause I'm so good when I'm rotten
no more Mr. Nice Guy wait and see
I'll become that nasty, naughty, dirty, spiteful
wicked, wayward, way delightful
bad guy I was born to be
One more time!
lying, loathsome, never tender
indiscreet repeat offender
no more Mr. Nice Guy that's not me!
Thank you. Thank you.
- Mother ... what are these? - Roses.
They're red. I don't want red roses.
I want white ones ... like a swan.
Has anyone seen Bromley? Would you feed this to a swan?
Take it back. Get something light and fresh.
No, Rogers, hold it!
Tonight the music must be rubato. Soft and graceful, like a swan.
- A swan? - Have you ever seen a swan?
- Of course I've seen a swan. - What would it sound like in music?
Soft and graceful, Rogers.
- Where is Bromley? - No one has seen him.
- Then who's going to be best man? - You mean ..?
- Oh, Derek! - That's the stuff, Rogers!
Come on, Mother.
Don't be so secretive, Derek. Tell me who she is.
It hurts me to lock you up, Odette. It hurts me deeply.
But then, a king's day is full of tough decisions.
Now you're mad at me again. I can't do nothing right.
But that's me.
I can't leave you like this. If you're not happy, neither am I.
If you can't attend the ball, then I'll bring the ball to you.
If you can't attend the ball, then I'll bring the ball to you. The first thing you'll need is a young man.
The prince is busy, but I can arrange a substitute.
No, please! I beg you!
Poor fellow. He got lost in the woods.
Help, help! Don't go.
I'd love to stay, but if I don't leave now, I'll be late.
Don't give me that look! Had to be sneaky, didn't you?
You had to drag your prince into it.
Well that's fine with me! Fine with me!
every single princess on the planet
prayed to be invited to the ball
every Portia, Guinevere and Janet
came by coach or boat to be here they'd swim the moat to be here
just to be at this historic gala
girls would walk, run or even crawl
rumor is that at this joyous scene tonight
the prince will likely choose his future queen tonight
Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Excuse me, Your Highness. - Yes, Chamberlain?
- It's getting rather crowded. - Then begin the introductions.
And Chamberlain ...
No mistakes! It must be perfect.
Oh no! I mean, oh yes, madam!
Everything will be perfect.
Promise to tell me who it is the moment she arrives.
Don't worry, Mother. You'll know. Believe me, you'll know.
- What? - It's coming. An idea!
- A large, colossal idea! - Sounds big.
I got it! Water leaks into the dungeon, right?
So there must be a hole.
We find it, make it bigger, and ...
- She's loose. - You're forgetting two things.
- His Majesty's got a point. - Not to worry. We need a scout.
Are you crazy? Who's going to jump in the moat?
- He's got to be a good swimmer. - And small!
- Teeny-weeny. - It wouldn't hurt if he was green.
Small, good swimmer, green ... Good grief! You're talking about me.
you're off on a mission you're tough, in good condition ...
Thank you! I know some of you just abhor beauty pageants, -
- but having been a puff-puff girl in '39, I just couldn't resist!
Girls! One ... two ... three!
beauty and glamour and breeding are matched
princesses on parade
lovely, enthralling and unattached
the hoi polloi and well-bred agree each one has a royal pedigree
born for success each possesses a spark
each a remarkable maid
these royal highnesses all have plusses and no minuses
- gaze upon - these princesses on parade!
This princess comes from Colchester, where corn and cotton grow.
She plays croquet and harpsichord and sews her own clothes.
Antonia isn't known to take the path of least resistance.
She hails from Southeast Harristan and came the farthest distance.
Griselda lives to help the world. She finds no task too menial.
And all the other girls think she's the most congenial.
Brunhilde is from Stuttgart where her armor was made.
- Gaze upon ... - princesses on parade!
this is the likely occasion
the heir to the throne picks a wife
this may be the day that Prince Derek will say
"Where have you been all my life?"
brilliant, beguiling a smiling brigade
princesses on parade
each the pride of her community each a golden opportunity
when Crown Prince Derek'll have to choose he'll be hysterical
gaze upon, heap praise upon
these radiant, luminous, dazzling
princesses on parade!
Chamberlain!
All who were invited are present, are they not?
Well, yes. I mean ...
- Open the door, Chamberlain! - But I checked my list ...
It must be the milkman.
Well, it's not the milkman.
No, it can't be!
Excuse me, I've got to get through. Oh! She's lovely, isn't she?
Queen coming through here!
- Who is it? Do you know her? - I don't know.
Rogers! I know he confides in you. Who is it?
I swear I've never seen her before. Although ...
... she does look a lot like ...
But it couldn't be. Could it?
- I was so worried. I thought ... - Nothing could keep me away.
Okay, Speed draws the gators away, then you run for that hole.
If the alligators don't chew me before I get there.
Don't worry! Speed will rush to help.
Ah, yes! Mr. Molasses will rush to help.
- Suddenly I'm full of comfort! - All right. Stretch out!
How did I get talked into this?
- To your mark. - Hey leatherheads!
Come and get me!
Perfect! All right . Ready, get set ... go!
- Faster! - Yes, Jean-Bob, race to your death!
- Get moving, Slowpoke! - Slowpoke?
Any luck?
- Jean-Bob! -To the rescue, mademoiselle!
There's the signal. Time to brush up diving technique.
Yoo-hoo! Those turtles are tough. How about a little white meat?
- We broke through. Let's go! - Thank you, Jean-Bob.
When this is over, remind me to give you a kiss.
What? What is it? Stay away! What are you doing?
No, get away.
I'll tell you when.
Let's go.
Friends call me Speedy.
Go, Odette, go!
Something about you seems ...
I don't know ... different.
Don't worry. After tonight, everything will be perfect.
Yes, of course.
Rogers, I'm going to make an announcement.
Kings and queens, ladies and gentlemen ... Mother.
I have an announcement to make. Today, I have found my bride.
No, Derek! It's a trick!
I present her to you as the future queen of our fair kingdom.
And as proof of my love for her -
- I make a vow to break all vows.
A vow stronger than all the powers of the earth.
Before you, and before the whole world ...
... I make a vow of everlasting love.
Derek!
... to Odette.
No more Mr. Nice Guy No sir-ee!
Hello, little prince. Pledged your love to another, did you?
What do you mean? This is Odette.
No! Odette is mine.
It's you! You have no power here!
I made a vow of everlasting love!
You made a vow, all right! A vow of everlasting ... death!
No, Odette!
You should have left her to me. Now she will die.
Odette!
- She's fading fast, little prince! - No!
Something's gone wrong.
If you hurry, little prince, I'll let you see her one last time!
There she is.
I don't think she's gonna make it.
Keep coming, girl!
Odette?
What have I done to you? Forgive me, Odette.
- Derek? - Yes, Odette. I'm here.
Derek, I feel so weak. I think I'm ...
No, you'll live, Odette. The vow I made was for you.
I know. I love you, Derek.
Odette ..? Odette!
I made the vow for her. Do you hear?
The vow I made was for her!
- No need to shout. - Don't let her die.
Is that a threat? Oh, it is a threat!
You're the only one with the power. Now, do it!
Only if you defeat me.
- The great animal! - I'm betting on the animal.
No!
I won't let her die.
The bow! Swim to the bottom of the lake and get Derek's bow.
Throw it, throw it.
Wake up.
Goodbye.
Please, no, please!
Forgive me, Odette.
I only wanted to break the spell.
To prove my love. Forgive me.
I love you. Your kindness and courage.
I always have.
- Derek? - Odette?
Well, there you have it. Everlasting love.
Well, Rogers, old man! I suppose you owe me an apology.
Well, Rogers, old man! I suppose you owe me an apology. If it weren't for me, the great animal would still be alive.
- Dear me, no! - What?
The great animal. It's alive!
- Uberta. - Rogers.
Everyone else is free, but the prince wants a fighting air force.
And it's my job to get you birds in shape.
You're in Puffin's army now. General Puffin.
I am ready for my kiss, mademoiselle.
Don't be too disappointed if nothing happens.
Finally, after all these years, I shall return to my throne.
- Don't forget to write. - You still don't believe me.
The only thing you'll turn is red.
Well, I am ready, Odette.
Voila! Well Speed, what do you have to say now?
That's what I thought. Now, if you don't mind, -
- I've got some schmoozing to do.
- Would you like a kiss too, Speed? - No, I'm happy as a turtle.
Bonjour, madame. The ladies still fall for me.
Now, do you love your son?
Now, do you understand?
You have a $10 million insurance policy. I know that.
Follow these instructions... ...or God be with your child.
You will remove your shirt... ...and hold it out the window to ID the car.
Be professional. Come alone.
Georgina! Obey me. I will love you. Come on.
- That's how it works, huh? - That's right.
She got a sister?
How's business?
The Japanese are here in a big way.
Cheap labor, factory space, but they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso.
I ferry them back and forth. They think I'm John Wayne.
- I live like a king down here. - Yes, you do.
- You been working? - Yeah. No.
No. I've been moving around. You know. Colombia, a couple of places I can't name.
No. I've been moving around. You know. Colombia, a couple of places I can't name. Nothing catches my fancy.
You think God'll forgive us for what we've done?
- No. - You don't?
Me either.
- How long you staying? - I don't know, I just, you know...
I wanted to see you, Ray, see how you're doing.
I just came by on impulse.
I could do with some impulse.
What happened?
Family paid the ransom, then they sent the kid home after a couple of days.
Minus an ear, of course.
Now every mother in Mexico City with money wants bigger bodyguards.
Now every mother in Mexico City with money wants bigger bodyguards. - My own wife included. - I hate to break it to you, but she's right.
- My own wife included. - I hate to break it to you, but she's right. She's right.
Look, Sammy, all my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
I have a policy. AIG. My dad gave it to me.
Yeah, I know. I got it for your dad.
But what'll you do in 60 days when you can't renew it because you have no bodyguard?
I know. I had to let Emilio go.
Well, you gotta please Lisa. I mean, ass like that's hard to find.
Look. A bodyguard's like anything else. You get what you pay for, okay?
A bodyguard's like anything else. You get what you pay for, okay?
You could do this. Get one that's got a decent résumé.
We're not looking for goddamn Superman, right? Get someone cheap.
We're not looking for goddamn Superman, right? Get someone cheap. So you renew the policy, and then fire the prick for whatever, incompetence.
So you renew the policy, and then fire the prick for whatever, incompetence.
All kidding aside, the most important thing is that your daughter goes back to school,
and that your wife gets to save face.
This way you won't be the only unprotected family in the neighborhood.
That's right, a bodyguard. Your Spanish is good enough.
- You're crazy. - You even look the part.
In my state, I couldn't guard a corpse.
It's rich guys flashing their cash. It's all for show. Nothing's gonna happen.
Yeah? You think they'd hire a drunk, a has-been?
You have to keep it under control.
What if there was, you know... Just, say, a kidnapping attempt? What do I do then?
You do your best. They're not gonna be paying you enough to perform miracles.
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed, you're pretty damn good.
Yeah. A bodyguard's gotta be close to people, though.
They talk all the time. You know I'm no good at that.
You'll be the silent type. They're gonna appreciate that.
Bodyguard. So who's the guy?
Samuel Ramos. He's a young guy.
- He owns one of the plants in Juárez. - Yeah?
The Jap car industry is in the toilet.
He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him.
I think he's in trouble. His family lives in Mexico City.
He asked me if I knew anybody he could trust.
- And you thought of me? - Yeah.
Take a job, Crease. Breathe some air.
Then decide if you want to stick around.
Besides, I'm glad to see you, you know? I got nobody to talk to down here.
Listen, my wife wants someone presentable and polite.
You'll be the fifth candidate she sees this week.
Your résumé's quite impressive.
Sixteen years of military experience, extensive counter-terrorism work.
I'm surprised anybody could afford you. What's the catch?
I drink.
How does that affect you?
Coordination, reaction time.
If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, I'll do the best I can,
but the service will be on a par with the pay.
What if amateurs try it?
I'd probably kill them. Is that likely?
No one is to know about your drinking. That includes my wife.
Lisa!
Lisa!
My wife Lisa. And this is John Creasy.
- You're an American. - So are you.
It's all in there.
- Would you like a drink? - Yes. Jack and water would be good.
Have you done much of this kind of work before?
No, ma'am.
But he has a lot of experience in related fields.
- Do you have a family, Mr. Creasy? - No.
Pita? Pita.
- Yes, Mom? - Honey, this is Mr. Creasy.
It's English, honey. Do you wanna show Mr. Creasy to his room?
- This way, Mr. Creasy. - Okay.
Thank you.
Just like that?
I think it's nice that he's an American.
I think it's terrific. Are you sure?
Thank you. Thank you.
I feel better now.
That's Bruno, the gardener. And that's Maria, the cook.
We fixed the room up two weeks ago. It's nicer than before.
You've got a TV and a CD player. What kind of music do you like, Mr. Creasy?
- I don't know. - You don't know?
- I don't know. - You don't know? I don't know.
That's Bird. Emilio forgot to take him when he left.
Emilio was my last bodyguard.
Have you protected a lot of children before, Mr. Creasy?
Creasy. You can call me Creasy. And no, you're the first.
Creasy. Bye, Creasy.
Bye, Creasy.
Bye, Bird.
- School tomorrow, Peeps. - Does that mean we can get a dog?
Dad promised me one when I went back to school.
Yeah, we'll see.
If you get a dog, will you give up your bear? You're getting too old for him.
- How did you like Mr. Creasy? - Creasy. He said to call him just Creasy.
- That isn't disrespectful, is it? - No, not if he asked you.
Here. There you go.
He's like a bear too. - Yeah? - A big, sad bear.
- Yeah? - A big, sad bear.
- Is he sad? - I think. Or something.
Good night, honey.
Can you get me some floss in the morning? - Floss? - Yeah, the strawberry kind.
- Floss? - Yeah, the strawberry kind. Sure.
Good night, Bear.
Creasy Bear.
- What's that one for? - La Virgen de Guadalupe.
Business. For Toyota, for Ford.
If one dies, maybe she can resurrect the other one. I don't know.
She likes him.
- What are you talking about? - Creasy.
Pita likes him.
Pita loves school. Pita would love Count Dracula if he took her back there, honey.
Okay?
Hey. Are you okay? - I don't know. - Okay?
- I don't know. - Okay?
I don't know, Lisa. I'm trying.
Come on, Bird.
That's right, that's right. Come on.
All right. Home to Emilio.
You're home free, baby.
- Where are you from, Creasy? - The U.S.
- I know, but which state? - No state in particular.
- You can drive and talk at the same time. - No, I can't, so please let me do my job.
Are you going to stay?
My last bodyguard left. Somebody gave him more money than we could.
I guess that makes me a bargain, then, huh?
Being black. Is that a positive or a negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Time will tell.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days.
- Four a day. - Yeah? Twenty-four?
- Twenty-four. What do you think? - I think you know more than you should.
- Twenty-four. What do you think? - I think you know more than you should. Well, thank you.
Well, thank you.
- See you later. - You have to sign.
- What? - You have to sign in. Show them your ID.
Come on.
Right there.
Pita! It's so good to have you back.
Sister Anna, this is my new bodyguard, Creasy.
- Sister Anna, the headmistress. - Señor Creasy.
- Hurry. Class is about to begin. Go, go. - Bye, Creasy.
You must look after our Pita. It is not good that she is late today.
I'm very sorry. I have to get used to the routes. It won't happen again.
No offense, but I regret that your profession needs to exist.
So do I, Madre, so do I.
Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?
No, not for a long time.
The Bible says, "Be not overcome of evil..." "But overcome evil with good."
"But overcome evil with good."
That's Romans Chapter 12 Verse 21.
I am the sheep that got lost, Madre.
When you were a kid, Creasy, did you like school?
- I don't remember. - You don't remember?
No, I don't remember. No, I didn't like it.
Why not?
Because it wasn't a school like yours, Pita. There was no Sister Anna.
Were you unhappy?
Being unhappy, that's a state of mind. I really don't remember.
What happened to your hand?
- It's a birth defect. - No, it's not.
Look, no more questions, okay?
- It really wasn't a question. - It sounded like a question to me.
Listen to me. I'm being paid to protect you.
No, no, no. I'm being paid to be your bodyguard. Look at me.
I'm being paid to be your bodyguard. Look at me. I'm not being paid to be your friend, but to protect you. So no more questions, period.
I'm not being paid to be your friend, but to protect you. So no more questions, period.
- Do you hear me? - Yes.
- No crying. - I'm not crying.
Well, don't start.
You gotta understand, this is a job. In order for me to do my job...
Wait a minute.
Yeah, come in.
Mr. Creasy.
I just wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
I'm fine, thanks.
Is the food all right? Because Maria told me you didn't eat.
Yeah, the food is great. I just wasn't that hungry tonight.
So you read the Bible?
Yeah, sometimes.
Does it help? Yeah, sometimes.
- Can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure.
How are you doing with Pita?
Fine. As soon as she figures out that I'm not her new toy, it'll be fine.
- She told me about that. - Okay.
- You don't have children, do you? - I told you I didn't.
Well, they can be tenacious when they want something.
And Pita just wants to be friends. Okay.
But you're paying me to protect her, not to be her friend, right?
So... Look, maybe this isn't gonna work out.
Maybe your husband should find somebody that's a little more sociable.
No, you're right.
You're being paid to protect her.
And I'm confident that you'll do that.
I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I hope that's all right.
You think God'll forgive us for what we've done?
I'm tired of killing, Ray. I'm tired of killing, Ray.
You think God'll forgive us for what we've done?
In my state, I couldn't... I couldn't guard a corpse.
They talk all the time.
You know I'm no good at that.
You know I'm no good at that.
You know how they say...
a bullet always tells the truth?
Yeah?
- Hey. - Crease.
What's wrong?
Hey, listen, you ever have a 9mm round that didn't go off?
Yeah. Failure to fire.
I know, failure to fire and... You know, I pulled the trigger and click, nothing.
You know, I pulled the trigger and click, nothing.
- You're talking about a bad primer. - Yeah, yeah, but I...
Yeah, right. Dimple on the primer. That may be...
Well, like we used to say...
a bullet always tells the truth.
Crease? You all right?
Crease? You all right? Yeah.
What were you shooting at?
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ray. I'm sorry I woke you.
No, it's okay, it's nothing. I was watching TV.
Okay.
Pita, you have a pencil?
Thank you.
- It's hard to get used to the traffic here. - Yeah. I'm very sorry.
- See you, baby. - See you later.

- I never finish better than third. - Then maybe you are slow.
With us this evening we have Mariana Guerrero from Reforma newspaper
to speak with us about the kidnappings.
Who are the ones responsible for the kidnappings in Mexico?
It is an activity of organized crime. It's not a random kidnapping.
They are not political kidnappings like in Colombia.
How do you think he got out?
I let him go. - It's better to be free, right? - It's better for him.
- It's better to be free, right? - It's better for him.
Actually, he was driving me crazy.
Good night.

Can I see that? It's kind of a wife. Right there.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them.
Okay, like nowadays, in the West, they have one husband for one wife.
But in the olden-time cultures they had, you know, different... Different rules.
Why? You feel sorry for the husband? Yeah. Can you imagine my mom multiplied by a thousand?
Yeah. Can you imagine my mom multiplied by a thousand?
Creasy. - You're smiling. - What?

Okay, in the next ten seconds, we'll see who smiles first.
- You smiled already. See? You did. - You.

That's right. Don't smile, don't fool around if you wanna win. Trained or untrained? - Trained. - Go.
- Trained. - Go.
- Señor Creasy, nice to see you. - Good to see you, Madre.
Pita's parents are away on business in Juárez.
Today, you are her father.
I won, Creasy! I won!
- Okay. - I won!
- Once upon a time, when we were young... - When I was young.
Well, when we were young and he was younger,
and all heads turned our way,
we made a deal to take the world together.
Yeah, then one day I got a call, and you said...
"I'm in love, I'm in love!" "And I'm moving to Mexico!"
And I said:
I said, "What happened to the plan? What happened to it?"
- I said, "The plan's right here!" - Yeah, yeah. And what'd I do?
I hung up. And then I met Alicia.
And then I went, "Now I got you. I got you."
I got it. Can I kiss her?
Absolutely. Hey, what are you doing?
- You got me. - Okay, I think now's as good a time as any.
I bought it with my own money.
Thank you.
Open it.
It's Saint Jude, the patron saint of lost causes.
Well deserved.
Thank you, Pita. It's beautiful.
You're welcome.
- Dad? - Yes, sweetie?
- Can I talk to you? - Yes.
I don't wanna play piano, I wanna swim.
It's not open for discussion, honey, okay? Mr. Lozzi's a very, very famous teacher.
It's not open for discussion, honey, okay? Mr. Lozzi's a very, very famous teacher. If he accepts you as a student, you're gonna play the piano. Sorry.

If you broke all my fingers, then taped them back together,
I wouldn't be able to play piano, but I could still swim.
Sam, get back.
Don't be a crybaby. You're tougher than that.
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.
Remember the day you wanted the pencil? - Yeah. - I know why.
- Yeah. - I know why.
Yeah?
You wanted the license number off of that car. I wrote it down in my notebook.
I got it all but the last number.
I'll get it from you later. Can you belch?
Like burp. Can you burp?
- That's good. That's very good. - I just had a Coke.
- That's good. That's very good. - I just had a Coke. Listen to me. This famous teacher...
Listen to me. This famous teacher...
He teaches a lot of rich kids and plays for the symphonies and all that, right?
Belch every few minutes while you're practicing.
You apologize to him, but keep belching. You'll offend every sensibility he has.
Very good. You'll be back in the pool in 24 hours, I guarantee you.
Right, Sam?
Lupita Ramos.
For you, Creasy.
Thank you.
- How does this look? - Good. Good.
Come on in.

Creasy!
This man, John W. Creasy,
This man, John W. Creasy, an American citizen,
is under arrest for the murder of two officers of the Judicial Police
and is suspected of possible involvement in the kidnapping of Lupita Martin Ramos.
Chief Ramirez...
The two officers who were killed.
Records show they were off duty at the time.
So why were they in uniform and in a patrol car?
All I know is that they died bravely.
Of course, but what exactly were they doing
at the scene of the kidnapping?
Or were they known for their exceptional good luck?
They were known for being corrupt
and now are celebrated for being dead.
Excuse me.
Relax, okay? Relax, Sammy.
I know she's your little girl. When I tell you everything's gonna be all right,
everything's gonna be all right.
Señor Ramos.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Victor Fuentes, Anti-Kidnapping Division, Policía Judicial.
Excuse me. I'm Jordan Kalfus. I'm the family attorney.
Speak slower, please. My Russian is better than my English.
I'm conducting the negotiations, and we neither need nor want police assistance.
We're gonna handle this thing ourselves.
Señor Ramos, two police officers were killed during your daughter's abduction.
I have a written order from the Public Minister...
authorizing our participation "unofficially."
If you want to speak to Attorney General Diaz, it's on me.
Okay.
The kidnapper will tell you to deliver the money alone.
Por favor, don't do that. Or you will find yourself in a real Mexican hell. No mariachi, no tequila...
Or you will find yourself in a real Mexican hell. No mariachi, no tequila... and no Pita.
Crease? Crease.
When I heard it was this hospital, I was so pleased.
There is a pastry shop nearby. Delgado's.
There is a pastry shop nearby. Delgado's. They have the best pastries in Mexico.
Miguel Manzano. Director of the AFI.
And a former director of Interpol, in Rome.
- And you are? - A friend of his. Rayburn.
Rayburn.
Do you love your daughter, Señor Ramos?
Yes. Yes.
- Do you want to see her again? - Yes, I do.
Señor... If your daughter's life is as important to you as it is to me,
you will do as I say.
Yes? Okay, yes.
Crease. You hear me?
You got four of them, all dead.
- Pita? - It's...
It's been two days. They're negotiating a ransom.
These things take time, Mr. Creasy.
Crease.
Don't fuck with me, all right?
You have the ten million? Do you have the money?
- Yes, we have the money. - Now, if you do as I say,
the girl will be returned exactly as she was taken.
But if you deviate from the process in any way...
By the Virgin of Guadeloupe,
I swear you will never see her again.
I understand. Listen, I too worship la Virgen de Guadalupe...
I ask if you understand.
Hello, sir. This is Mr. Ramos's attorney.
He's going through a very difficult time, but he understands.
Do you understand? Repeat the drop instructions.
Okay, the money, 10 million, will be divided into two 15-gallon black canvas bags,

then driven to the house where it will be transferred to the delivery car.
You got a flat tire here.
This is for you.
Hello. Yeah.
Listen, I need a driver to drive Samuel.
No. Why?
He's got a bad ticker. He's got a heart condition.
Look, he's a nervous kid. He doesn't respond well to stress.
All right, but the car will not be powerful.
Remove the trunk lid. Use the maid's Valiant Acapulco.
You will arrive at La Diana fountain at 1 a.m.
You will drive around the circle two times.
Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window
to ID the car.
There is a payphone on the southeast corner.
The phone will ring. You will answer and wait for instructions.
There is a map on the top of the phone. Follow it.
- What are you doing? He said no phones. - Relax, relax.
I'm just trying to protect your daughter, okay?
What's going on? Hospitals can be very dangerous places,
especially when you have killed two corrupt cops.
Leave the money in the trunk of the white car
and return to your car.
Do not look back.
What's going on, guys?
Remember, I'm a professional.
If you keep your word, I will keep mine.
- Hello? - Mr. Ramos.
You betrayed me. You killed my nephew.
You took my money.
Señor Ramos...
God be with your child.
All right. Get out of here, all of you. Get the fuck out of my house!
Okay, this is Lisa...
Martin Ramos. I'm Pita's mother.
And I'm very sorry for whatever happened to your nephew, but I beg you...
Please don't harm my daughter.
This conversation is not being recorded.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I wish we had talked sooner, señora.
I'm really sorry.
Now it is too late.
Fuck off! Get the fuck out of my fucking house! Now!
Get out! Get out!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Ray. How are you...?
- Where am I? - Well, it looks like a dog hospital.
Manzano was afraid the cops were gonna kill you.
How you doing, doc?
What's the matter?
She's dead, Crease.
It's a mess. Somebody hijacked the drop and...
The kidnapper's nephew was killed, so he killed Pita.
He has gunshot wounds to the chest and the abdomen.
He has a collapsed lung which we've re-inflated. He's lucky to be alive. If he doesn't rest, he will die.
He's lucky to be alive. If he doesn't rest, he will die.
How long will he be hospitalized?
Approximately a month.
No.
No.
Did you recognize any of these men?
No. Does that make me a suspect?
No. It would be convenient, but no.
Maybe you should show me pictures of Mexican cops. Maybe we'll get somewhere.
Maybe you should show me pictures of Mexican cops. Maybe we'll get somewhere. Those were all policemen.
Bad Judicial cops,

Let's go.

Mariana something, works for Reforma.
Newspaper journalist.
I guess she thinks you're a scoop.
I'll get you up to the border.
A friend will take you to San Diego, drop you at the Naval Hospital.
I'm not going, Ray. What are you gonna do?
Let's take a ride by the crime scene. She can follow us.
Mr. Creasy?
A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm Mariana García Guerrero.
Reporter, for Reforma.
Nice to meet you. I found this across the street.
Open it.
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship.

There's a brotherhood called La Hermandad.
It protects government officials, corrupt police and organized crime
It protects government officials, corrupt police and organized crime at a level that is too difficult for me to reach.
Okay.
And I think that you and Lupita Ramos are victims of this organization.
I want to expose them. Talk to me, give me your story, and then I can help you. Please.
Help me do what?
You're gonna help me do what?
- You're a stranger here, no? - That's right.
You're going to need friends that know their way around.

- Is that a yes or is that a no? - Yeah! But... - I'm done killing. I told you that. - Okay.
Anything else is yours.
- You're talking about war, Crease. - Exactly. Can you help me?
- Yeah. - Good.
Creasy?
What are you doing here?
I came to get my stuff.
Couldn't find my Bible. I thought it might be in here.
- I borrowed it. - Okay.
It's crazy, huh?
One week we're figuring out which nightclub to go to, and the next thing I'm...
One week we're figuring out which nightclub to go to, and the next thing I'm... reading the Bible.
It's a good thing. You hold on to it.
I keep thinking if only we hadn't...
My whole life all I've ever thought about was what I could get for myself.
Not my own baby.
She needed me so much, and sometimes I felt like I had nothing to give her.
Just... I don't know what to do.
- What are you gonna do? - What I do best.
I'm gonna kill them.
Anyone involved, who profited from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.
You kill them all.
Yeah, it's me.
- Mr. Creasy. - I need the license... No, excuse me.
I need the name and address of someone whose license number is C5TK8.
I need the name and address of someone whose license number is C5TK8. That's C5TK8.
I got everything but the last digit, so I need ten possible matches.
And when do I find out which of the ten it is?
- Eventually. - But where do I reach you?
I'll call you.
Do you know who he is? Do you know what he's been doing the last 16 years?
Counter-insurgency work in Thailand, Pakistan...
Jordan, Angola, Lebanon. Yes, I know all of that.
He's an assassin... and you want to help him identify the owner of a car for him?
He can go places we can't.
If you don't want to use him... I will.
When do I get to sleep with you again? We never sleep. We fuck. Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Jorge González.
I'm a Judicial Policeman. Drive.
Okay.

I am going to ask questions.
If you don't answer fully and truthfully, you will suffer much more than you have to.
I'm going to cut your fingers off.
One by one, if I have to. This is to stop the bleeding.
Don't mess with me.
You know who I am?
A member of La Hermandad.

What do you know about a cop named Fuentes?
He's with the Anti-Kidnapping Division. He drove Samuel Ramos to the drop.
- Fuentes? - Who is she?
You can ask her later. She'll tell you anything.
What do you know about Fuentes?
Three years ago they caught him with $50,000 and a dead body in the trunk.
Never charged. The arresting officer couldn't testify because he was dead.
Was he La Hermandad?
- You know where he lives? - He lives in a Judicial compound.
He travels by motorcade.
He's better protected than the president of Mexico.
He's gonna need it. Can you take care of her?
- Yes, but how can I find you? - I'll find you.
This is my jurisdiction.
I want this man as much as Creasy does.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals.
Just stay out of his way. I plan to.
I will even help him, if I can.
But... I'd like to understand him.
Give me that.
Pita Ramos...
is a number to you.
One more dead, but a number.
What was she to Creasy, then?
She showed him it was all right to live again.
And the kidnappers took that away, huh?
And they're gonna wish they never touched a hair on her head.
A man can be an artist...
at anything, food, whatever.
It depends on how good he is at it.
Creasy's art is death.
He's about to paint his masterpiece.
I don't have anything else to say.
I need the accounts linked to this card.
PIN number is 4747.
On one condition.
I'm not here to hurt you.

Forgiveness is between them and God.

Not very sophisticated, but very powerful.
That's what you have in your ass right now.
Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.
Cheap watch, pager watch,
used to send a page to the receiver that's up your behind right now.
So... I'm gonna send you a page which you will receive...
in five minutes.
Now...
You got less than five minutes to tell me what went down
between your men and the kidnapper. I have nothing to do with the kidnapper.
- Four minutes and 30 seconds. - Nothing. I don't know him.
You don't know? Four minutes and 25 seconds.
Four minutes and 20 seconds. Are you sure?
Okay.
I got all the time in the world. You don't, but I do.
- Relax, relax, buddy. - I'm relaxed.
You got three minutes, 59 seconds.
- I saw the opportunity, and I got lucky. - And?
And I had my men ready, as we got instructions where to go.
You had your men ready to steal the drop, ready to kill one of the kidnappers, yeah?
You had your men ready to steal the drop, ready to kill one of the kidnappers, yeah? You've done this many times.
You've done this many times. What's going on, guys?
- One of the nephews of the kidnapper. - Bingo, bingo, yeah.
You've done this many times. Many times, yes.
Yeah. You've killed many victims too, haven't you?
- We just make out as best we can. - "As best we could"?
Two minutes, 47 seconds.
Wait a minute. - Come on, I have a little gift for you. - For me?
- Come on, I have a little gift for you. - For me?
- Yeah, come on. - What have you got?
There was no $10 million. There was two and a half in the bags.
The ransom was $10 million. They put it in two bags, 5 million in each bag.
The ransom was $10 million. They put it in two bags, 5 million in each bag. Two bags, true, but one has half paper,
Two bags, true, but one has half paper, the other only paper.
Maybe your men stole it.
No, no. Whoever did it took it before the exchange.
Okay. At the Ramos house, before the exchange,
At the Ramos house, before the exchange, who put the bags into the car?
- Guess what. - What?
Ramos' lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.
- Jordan Kalfus? - Yeah.
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry for the girl.
It was just business, you know? I'm a professional.
That's what everybody keeps saying: I'm just a professional.
Everybody keeps saying that to me. I'm just a professional.
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing it. Do you understand me?
What are you going to do now?
What am I gonna do? Leave. I gotta go.
Go? Hey, come on, come on. What about me?
What about you? You got 40 seconds. - Come on. - Thirty-five!
- Come on. - Thirty-five! Give me a last wish, please, please.
Last wish? I wish...
Last wish? I wish... you had more time.
Hey. Hey, hey.
- Mariana, it's me. - Creasy, where are you?
I got something like banking codes from Bankcoast in the Cayman Islands.
- I need it translated as fast as you can. - Whose account is it?
Jordan Kalfus. It looks like U.S. deposits and withdrawals. Give me the same thing on Samuel Ramos.
It looks like U.S. deposits and withdrawals. Give me the same thing on Samuel Ramos.
It looks like U.S. deposits and withdrawals. Give me the same thing on Samuel Ramos. - That's it? - That's it.
Okay.
Creasy. - Samuel. - Honey?
- Samuel. - Honey?
What's going on?
That's what I wanna know. What is going on?
Sam?
I'm gonna ask your wife a couple of questions, okay? You move...
You make one sound...
and I'll snatch the life right out of you, you understand?
What happened, Lisa?
Were you in on this, or was it just your husband?
Were you in on this, or was it just your husband? - Am I in on what? - You know what.
- Am I in on what? - You know what. Pita's kidnapping, her death. Were you a part of it?
Pita's kidnapping, her death. Were you a part of it?
- Pita got killed because the ransom... - Shut up!
Yeah, the money was stolen, you're right.
The money was stolen by Victor Fuentes. How much was stolen? Two-point-five million, right?
How much was stolen? Two-point-five million, right? - What are you talking about? - He knows what I'm talking about.
- What are you talking about? - He knows what I'm talking about.
- That's what Victor got. - What are you talking about?
- That's what Victor got. - What are you talking about? Two-point-five million. Two-point-five million to your lawyer, Jordan Kalfus.
Two-point-five million. Two-point-five million to your lawyer, Jordan Kalfus.
He put it in an account in the Cayman Islands, but he won't get to spend it.
What happened to the other five, Sam?
That's 2.5, 2.5. What is five from ten? Five. What happened to the other five?
What is five from ten? Five. What happened to the other five? Tell your wife. This is your chance.
Tell your wife. This is your chance. - You got a wife, Creasy? - No, I don't.
- You got a wife, Creasy? - No, I don't. You'll never know how hard it is to tell your wife the truth.
You'll never know how hard it is to tell your wife the truth. No, you have a wife! You tell me what happened!
No, you have a wife! You tell me what happened!
- It was in this room that my father... - I don't give a fuck about your father!
He prayed for his gambling debts and his infidelities to be forgiven.
- Samuel! - What? - I love you! Tell me the truth! - I didn't inherit a kingdom! That's the truth!
- I love you! Tell me the truth! - I didn't inherit a kingdom! That's the truth!
You wanna know the truth? I inherited his debt and his mess!
- Tell me what happened to my baby! - I inherited his lawyer!
Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Be a fucking man!
Jordan told me she'd sit in a room and watch cartoons all day.
And she'd eat ice cream. And we'd have her back in two days. He lied to me!
And we'd have her back in two days. He lied to me!
That's why he's fucking dead. I did it!
I did it, Lisa! I agreed to the kidnapping.
I did it for us. For the three of us.
I'm so sorry, Lisa.
You kill him.
You kill him, or I will.
You know how they say a...
bullet always tells the truth.
It never lies.
It didn't work for me, Samuel, but maybe...
maybe it'll work for you.
I'll pray for you.
This is definitely the address from the ATM card.
The PIN number was a great locator.
But there's no one that sounds anything like The Voice.
Who's that?
He's the man, The Voice.
My guys got into the house...
on the pretext of giving cholera shots.
We had to inject the whole barrio.
We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.
Now it's time to pursue him.
We have to put his photo in tomorrow's newspaper.
If you value your life, you won't publish those photos.
- Mr. Creasy? - Yeah, it's me.
I traced the PIN for you and I have an address.
Yeah?
The cardholder is Reina Rosas Sanchez, the wife of "The Voice."
She lives in Los Arcos, apartment 26D, via Appia.
- Good. - And another thing.
In today's paper is a picture of The Voice. "FEAR HAS A VOICE."
Good. Thank you.
He's in. What do we do?
Nothing... Nothing.
Out of my house, you son of a bitch! Stop there!
Get out. The kids out. Now!
Sit down!
Reina Rosas, yes?
Who is this? Who is this?
- Daniel. - Daniel what?
Daniel Rosas Sanchez.
The Voice?
And this is his brother?
What is his name?
What is his name?
Aurelio.
Aurelio Rosas Sanchez, okay.
Okay.
And you are Daniel's woman, right?
How do you contact him?
How do you contact him?
We page him,
and he calls back on his cellphone.
There's no signal in here.
We have to go on the roof.
Let's go outside.
Outside.
They're going to get a call. Be ready to track him.
If we're lucky he'll lead us to The Voice.
Hola, Daniel. - Señor Creasy. - Yeah.
- Señor Creasy. - Yeah. Yeah, I got your family here.
Your brother doesn't look too good.
Yeah, Reina, she's what, about eight months? Yeah?
You wanna negotiate?
The most important thing in life is family. Do you agree?
I agree.
There you are, you have my family.
Well, most of my family.
My wife and I are separated. You know how that is.
Now, tell me seriously, how much do you want?
Your brother wants to speak to you. Here, hold on.
What the hell do you want?
Listen to me! Listen!
I'll take your family apart piece by piece. You understand me?
Piece by piece! Shut up!
I don't want your money.
You understand me? You understand me? I want you!
I'm listening.
I'm listening, Daniel. I'm listening.
All right. I will give you a life for a life.
Whose life? What are you talking about?
Whose life, Daniel? I want you!
I will give you her life. For your life.
And in exchange, I will get my life back.
- What life? Whose life? - The girl's. Pita's.
- Pita's dead! - Creasy!
I'm a businessman. A girl dead is worth nothing. She's alive.
All right.
I want proof of life, you hear me? I want proof of life. I want...
I want proof of life, you hear me? I want proof of life. I want... I want the name of her bear. What does she call her bear?
You tell her to tell you to tell me what she calls her bear.
Little one... What do you call your teddy bear?
Yeah? Creasy. She calls the bear Creasy Bear.
Creasy. She calls the bear Creasy Bear.
Remember... I will give you her life for your life
and the life of my brother.
Okay. Okay.
I give you your brother, you give me the girl.
- All right. - Where?
He left the roof. We lost the signal. We got cut off.
We lost him. We lost him.
Damn.
- Hello? - Lisa, listen to me. Don't hang up.
I think Pita's alive.
I can't take this anymore.
Take the road to Puebla. Get off junction 34, south side.
I'll meet you there in two hours.
So where is she?
She's right over there. You see those two cars out there?
Pita's kidnapper, Daniel...
Here's his brother.
Here.
I'm going up on the bridge to get Pita.
Anything goes wrong, you put it to his head,
you pull the trigger, all right?
You understand?
You don't let him loose until she's with you, you got it?
until she's with you, you got it?
And you don't wait for me, okay?
- Yeah. - You'll be all right. You okay? Yeah.
Creasy!
Creasy!
Creasy!
- You all right? - Yeah.
They didn't hurt you?
Hi.
All right, your mother's waiting for you. She's at the end the bridge.
- Okay, you go home. - Okay.
- All right. - Where are you going?
I'm going home too.
I'm going to Blue Bayou.
Hey.
I got something for you.
I got the last number too.
I love you, Creasy.
And you love me, don't you? Yes, I do.
Now, come on, Pita, go.
- Go. Run. - Bye.
Pita! - Mom! - Baby, come here! It's okay!
It's alive. It's alive!
There he is! Hit it again!
Success!
Count, it's just you.
I was beginning to lose faith, Victor.
A pity your moment of triumph is being spoiled
over a little thing like grave robbery.
Yes. Yes.
I must... I must escape this place.
[Dracula] Where are you going to run, Victor?
Your peculiar experiments have made you unwelcome
in most of the civilized world.
I'll take him away, far away, where no one will ever find him.
No, no, Victor.
The time has come for me to take command of him.
What are you saying?
Why do you think I brought you here? Gave you this castle?
Why do you think I brought you here? Gave you this castle? -Equipped your laboratory? -You said...
-Equipped your laboratory? -You said... -You said you believed in my work. -And I do.
-You said you believed in my work. -And I do.
But now that it is, as you yourself have said,
a triumph of science
over God,
it must now serve my purpose.
-What purpose? -[thunder rumbling]
Good God!
I would kill myself before helping in such a task.
Feel free. I don't actually need you anymore, Victor.
I just need him.
He is the key.
I could never allow him to be used for such evil.
I could.
In fact, my brides are insisting upon it.
Igor, help me!
[Igor] You have been so kind to me, Doctor,
caring, thoughtful.
But he pays me.
Stay back.
You can't kill me, Victor.
-I'm already dead. -[thunder rumbling]
Dr. Frankenstein!
Look, it's headed for the windmill! Come on!
Burn it! Burn it down!
Why?
[woman] Vampires. -[man 1] Run for your lives! -[man 2 in Hungarian] Vampires!
Father.
Evening.
You're a big one. You'll be hard to digest.
-I'd hate to be such a nuisance. -[Mr. Hyde laughing]
I missed you in London.
No, you bloody did not! You got me good.
Dr. Jekyll, you're wanted by the Knights of the Holy Order--
It's Mr. Hyde now.
For the murder of 12 men, six women, four--
Children, three goats, and a rather nasty massacre of poultry!
So you're the great Van Helsing.
And you're a deranged psychopath.
We all have our little problems.
My superiors would like for me to take you alive
so that they may extricate your better half.
I bet they bloody would.
Personally, I'd rather just kill you and call it a day.
But let's make it your decision, shall we?
Mmm. Do let's.
[Mr. Hyde] Here I come, ready or not!
The bell! The bell!
No, no, no...
I'll bet that's upsetting.
Oh, Paris!
Come here.
I think you'll find the view over here rather spectacular.
It's been a pleasure knowing you. Au revoir!
Oh, no. No, no, no!
My turn.
-[screaming] -[thud] [in Latin] May he rest in peace.
Van Helsing.
You murderer!
[sighing] Bless me, Father, for I have-- [Father] Sinned. Yes, I know. You're very good at that.
[Father] Sinned. Yes, I know. You're very good at that.
You shattered the Rose Window.
Not to split hairs, sir, but it was Mr. Hyde who did the shattering.
Thirteenth century. Over 600 years old.
-I wish you a week in hell for that. -It would be a nice reprieve.
-I wish you a week in hell for that. -It would be a nice reprieve. Don't get me wrong. Your results are unquestionable
Don't get me wrong. Your results are unquestionable
but your methods attract far too much attention.
"Wanted" posters? We are not pleased.
Do you think I like being the most wanted man in Europe?
Why don't you and the Order do something about it?
Because we do not exist.
Well, then neither do I.
[Father] When we found you crawling up the steps of this church, half-dead,
it was clear to all of us that you had been sent to do God's work.
-Why can't he do it himself? -Don't blaspheme.
You already lost your memory as a penance for past sins.
If you wish to recover it
I suggest you continue to heed the call.
Without us, the world would be in darkness.
Governments and empires come and go
but we have kept mankind safe since time immemorial.
We are the last defense against evil.
An evil that the rest of mankind has no idea even exists.
To you, these monsters are just evil beings to be vanquished.
I'm the one standing there when they die
and become the men they once were.
For you, my good son, this is all a test of faith.
And now, we need you to go to the East.
To the far side of Romania.
An accursed land
terrorized by all sorts of nightmarish creatures.
Lorded over by a certain Count Dracula.
-Dracula? -Yes.
You've never faced one like this before.
Our story begins 450 years ago
when a Transylvanian knight, named Valerious the Elder,
promised God that his family would never rest nor enter heaven
until they vanquished Dracula from their land.
They have not succeeded
and they are running out of family.
His descendant, Boris Valerious, King of the Gypsies.
He disappeared almost 12 months ago.
His only son, Prince Velkan, and his daughter, Princess Anna.
If the two of them are killed before Dracula is vanquished,
nine generations of their family
will never enter the gates of St. Peter.
For more than four centuries this family has defended our left flank.
They gave their lives.
We cannot let them slip into purgatory.
So you're sending me into hell.
In a manner.
Valerious the Elder left this here 400 years ago.
We don't know its purpose
but he would not have left it lightly.
The Latin inscription translates as,
"In the name of God, open this door."
There is an insignia.
Yes, it matches your ring.
I think that in Transylvania you may find the answer you seek.
[Carl] Faster, please. Faster!
Faster! Faster!
Getting there. -Carl! -Ah, there you are.
Well, did you bring Mr. Hyde back, or did you kill him?
You killed him, didn't you? That's why they get so annoyed.
When they ask you to bring someone back, they don't mean as a corpse.
Oh, all right, you're in a mood. Well, come on.
I've got a few things that'll put the bit back in your mouth.
-Any idiot can make a sword. -Hey!
Sorry, Father. -Come along, Carl. -Here, take this.
-Come along, Carl. -Here, take this. Rings of garlic, holy water,
Rings of garlic, holy water,
silver stake, crucifix.
Why can't I have one of those?
You've never gone after vampires before now, have you?
Vampires, gargoyles, warlocks, they're all the same.
-Best when cooked well. -No, no, no, they're not all the same.
A vampire is nothing like a warlock. My granny could kill a warlock.
A vampire is nothing like a warlock. My granny could kill a warlock. Carl, you've never even been out of the abbey.
Carl, you've never even been out of the abbey. -How do you know about vampires? -I read.
-How do you know about vampires? -I read.
Here's something new.
Glycerin 48.
[Carl] Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
[man] What in the name of Allah is wrong with you?
The air around here is thick with envy. Ah.
This is my latest invention. It's gas-propelled.
This is my latest invention. It's gas-propelled. Capable of catapulting arrows in rapid succession
Capable of catapulting arrows in rapid succession at tremendous velocity. Just pull the trigger and hold on.
at tremendous velocity. Just pull the trigger and hold on.
I've heard the stories coming out of Transylvania.
Trust me, you'll need this. A work of certifiable genius.
-If you don't say so yourself. -No, I did say so myself.
I'm a veritable cornucopia of talent. Did you invent this?
I've been working on that for 12 years.
It's compressed magma from Mt. Vesuvius
with pure alkaline from the Gobi Desert.
-It's one of a kind. -What's it for?
Oh, I don't know, but I'm sure it'll come in handy.
Twelve years, and you don't know what it does?
I didn't say that. I said I didn't know what it's for.
What it does is to create a light source
equal to the intensity of the sun.
This will come in handy how?
I don't know. You can blind your enemies.
Charbroil a herd of charging wildebeest.
Use your imagination. No, Carl, I'm gonna use yours. That's why you're coming with me.
No, Carl, I'm gonna use yours. That's why you're coming with me. -Holy hell be damned that I am! -You cursed.
-Holy hell be damned that I am! -You cursed. Not very well, but you're a monk.
Not very well, but you're a monk. You shouldn't curse at all.
Actually, I'm still just a friar. I can curse all I want,
damn it!
The Cardinal has ordered you to keep me alive.
-For as long as possible. -But I'm not a field man.
Van Helsing...
I don't want to go to Transylvania.
Come on.
Dracula unleashed you for a reason.
Pull me up! Pull me up!
It's stuck!
-No, Anna, it will kill you! -That's my brother out there.
Cut the rope! Cut it now!
Velkan!
My gun! Find my gun!
Find Velkan's gun. It has to be the silver bullets.
Anna, hurry! Hurry!
Move.
Anna, look out!
Run!
Velkan.
God,
help us.
-So, what do you remember? -Not now, Carl.
There must be something.
I remember fighting the Romans at Masada.
-That was in 73 A.D. -You asked.
What are we doing here?
Why is it so important to kill this Dracula, anyway?
-Because he's the son of the Devil. -I mean, besides that.
If we kill him, anything bitten or created by him will also die.
I mean, besides that. Welcome to Transylvania.
-Is it always like this? -Pretty much.
[Anna] You, turn around.
-Let me see your faces. -Why?
-Let me see your faces. -Why? Because we don't trust strangers.
Strangers don't last long here. 5'7" by 2'3".
[Anna] Gentlemen, you will now be disarmed.
You can try.
[Anna] You refuse to obey our laws?
-The laws of men mean little to me. -Fine.
-The laws of men mean little to me. -Fine. Kill them.
-I'm here to help you. -I don't need any help.
Really?
Everybody inside!
[woman] Hide the children!
-Stay here -[grunts]
You stay here. They're trying to kill me.
-Marishka, kill the stranger. -Love to.
[Anna] Run!
Carl, it's not working.
[Carl] Try aiming at their hearts.
It's the sun.
Van Helsing.
Do you like to fly, Anna?
-[gasps] -Hello, Anna.
Nice to see you, too, Aleera.
Did I do something to you in a past life?
Don't play coy with me, Princess.
I know what lurks in your lusting heart.
I hope you have a heart, Aleera,
because someday I'm going to drive a stake through it.
This should do the trick.
Holy water!
Stop your teasing, Marishka, and finish him.
Too bad. So sad.
The church!
Thirty years old. Perfectly aged.
Hello, Anna, my dear.
The last of the Valerious.
I can feel fresh blood rushing through her veins.
Here she comes!
I want first bite.
-[woman] He killed a bride! -[man 1] He killed Marishka!
[man 2] You killed Marishka!
-[man 3] You killed a vampire! -But isn't that a good thing?
Vampires only kill what they need to survive.
One or two people a month.
Now they will kill for revenge.
-Are you always this popular? -Pretty much.
So what name, my good sir, do I carve on your gravestone?
His name is Van Helsing.
Your reputation precedes you.
Next time stay close. You're no good to me dead.
Well, I'll say this for you. You've got courage.
He's the first one to kill a vampire in over 100 years.
I'd say that's earned him a drink.
Marishka!
[Dracula] Why can't they just leave us alone?
We never kill more than our fill and less than our share.
Can they say the same?
Did I not stress how important it was
to be finished with Anna Valerious
before she destroys what we are trying to create?
-[Aleera] We lost Marishka. -[Verona] Master.
There, there, my darlings. Do not worry.
There, there, my darlings. Do not worry. -I shall find another bride. -What?
-I shall find another bride. -What?
-Do we mean so little to you? -Have you no heart?
No, I have no heart! I feel no love!
Nor fear,
nor joy,
nor sorrow!
I am hollow.
And I will live forever.
-My Lord. -It is not so bad.
[Dracula] I am at war with the world
and every living soul in it.
But soon the final battle will begin.
I must go and find out who our new visitor is.
You will have to make a little aperitif out of him.
We are much too close to success to be interrupted now.
[Aleera] No! [Verona] The last experiment was a failure!
Please, say you will not try again.
My heart could not bear the sorrow if we fail again.
Come.
Do not fear me.
Everybody else fears me.
Not my brides.
[Dracula] Igor.
Yes, Master.
Why do you torment that thing so?
It's what I do.
Remember, Igor, "Do unto others..."
Before they do unto me, Master.
Now go, all of you!
To Castle Frankenstein!
[Aleera] Yes, yes, we will try again.
So, how did you get here? We came by sea.
-[Anna] Really? The sea? -[Carl] Well, yes.
[Anna] The Adriatic Sea?
[Van Helsing] So, where do I find Dracula?
[Anna] He used to live in this very house four centuries ago.
No one knows where he lives now.
My father would stare at that painting for hours
looking for Dracula's lair.
-So that's why you've come? -I can help you.
-No one can help me. -I can try.
You can die trying. All of my family has.
-I can handle this myself. -So I noticed.
The vampires attacked in daylight. They never do that.
I was unprepared. It won't happen again.
So why did they attack in daylight?
Clearly they wanted to catch me off guard.
They seem almost desperate to finish off my family.
-Why is that? Why now? -You ask a lot of questions.
Usually I ask only two. What are we dealing with, and how do I kill it?
My father spent most of his life looking for answers year after year.
My father spent most of his life looking for answers year after year. Tearing through the tower, combing through the family archives.
Tearing through the tower, combing through the family archives.
-Carl, the tower. Start there. -Right.
The only way to save your family is to stay alive till Dracula's killed.
And who will kill him if not me? Who will show courage if not me?
Go alone and you'll be outmanned and outpositioned.
And you can't see in the dark.
In the morning, we will hunt him
but we'll do it together.
Some say you're a murderer, Mr. Van Helsing.
Others say you're a holy man. Which is it?
[sighing] It's a bit of both, I think.
-I promised you a drink. -Yes, you did.
The bar is down the hall. Help yourself.
As for me, I'm going to finish this once and for all.
I'm sorry you have to carry this burden alone.
On the contrary, I would wish for it no other way.
I'm sorry about your father and brother.
I will see them again.
We Transylvanians always look on the brighter side of death.
-There's a brighter side of death? -Yes. It's just harder to see.
I'm sorry about that, too.
Van Helsing!
Van Helsing?
-Velkan? -Anna.
Oh, my God, you're alive.
No. Anna, I only have a moment. -But there's a werewolf... -Never mind! Listen to me!
-But there's a werewolf... -Never mind! Listen to me! I know Dracula's secret. He has a...
I know Dracula's secret. He has a...
-Velkan? -Please.
No! No!
No, no, no!
Run, Anna.
[Van Helsing] Anna!
Anna... Are you all right? Anna?
Why does it smell like wet dog in here?
Werewolf!
Oh, right. You'll be needing silver bullets, then.
Well done.
Who's hunting whom?
Nice night. This is a bit tight for me.
Nice night. This is a bit tight for me. But for you it's a perfect fit.
But for you it's a perfect fit.
What a coincidence.
I see the wolf man hasn't killed you yet.
Don't worry, he's getting to it.
-You don't seem too bothered by him. -I'm no threat to him.
I'm just the one who cleans up after him,
if you get my meaning.
Little late to be digging graves, isn't it?
Never too late to dig graves.
You never know when you'll need a fresh one.
Oh, sorry. It's just my nature.
[Anna] No.
-[Van Helsing] Move! -[Anna] No!
-Why? -You're choking me!
-Give me a reason not to. -I can't. If people knew...
He's not your brother anymore, Anna!
-You knew? -Yes.
Before or after I stopped you from shooting him?
Before.
And still you tried to kill him!
He's a werewolf! He's gonna kill people! He can't help it! It's not his fault!
I know, but he'll do it anyway!
Do you understand forgiveness? Yes. I ask for it often.
Yes. I ask for it often.
They say Dracula has a cure.
If there's a chance I can save my brother, -I'm going after it. -No.
-I'm going after it. -No. -I need to find Dracula. -And I need to find my brother!
He gave his life for me. He's the only family I have left.
I despise Dracula more than you can ever imagine.
He has taken everything from me, leaving me alone in this world.
To have memories of those you loved and lost
is perhaps harder than to have no memories at all.
All right.
We'll look for your brother.
-Igor. -Yes, Master.
-How long before we are ready? -Soon, Master. Very soon.
It is difficult without the good doctor
but the Dwergi, they are doing well?
Good.
[Anna] For me, this is all personal. It's all about family and honor.
Why do you do it, this job of yours? What do you hope to get out of it?
I don't know. Maybe some self-realization.
What have you got out of it so far?
Nightmares.
Werewolves only shed before the first full moon.
Before the curse has completely consumed them.
-[Van Helsing] What is this place? -[Anna] Castle Frankenstein.
-[Van Helsing] What is this place? -[Anna] Castle Frankenstein. But it should be abandoned.
I don't understand. The man who lived here was killed a year ago.
-A grave robber, among other things. -A year ago.
-A grave robber, among other things. -A year ago. It was just after that that your father went missing.
Yes. He was looking for Dracula. He was on his way to the sea.
I have never been to the sea.
I'll bet it's beautiful.
Werewolves are such a nuisance during their first full moon.
So hard to control.
I send you on a simple errand
to find out who our new visitor is,
and you have to stop for a little chat with your sister.
Leave her out of this, Count. She doesn't know your secret.
And I am soon to take it to my grave.
Don't wish for death so quickly. I intend for you to be quite useful.
I would rather die than help you.
Don't be boring. Everyone who says that dies.
Besides, tonight, after the final stroke of midnight,
you will have no choice but to obey me.
Look familiar?
Father?
No!
He proved useless. But I'm hoping, with werewolf venom running through your veins
But I'm hoping, with werewolf venom running through your veins
you will be of greater benefit!
I may have failed to kill you, Count, but my sister will not.
Never! Never! Never!
-Dwergi. -Dwergi?
-Dwergi. -Dwergi? Dracula's servants. Industrious but extremely vicious.
Dracula's servants. Industrious but extremely vicious.
If you get the chance to kill one, do it -because they'll do worse to you. -Right.
-because they'll do worse to you. -Right.
They say they're using my brother in some sort of experiment.
My brother is still battling the sickness within him.
-There's still hope. -Anna.
There is no hope for your brother.
But we can still protect others by killing Dracula.
Let us begin!
[Van Helsing] You ever see these things before?
[Anna] No. What do you think they are?
Offspring. [Anna] What?
[Van Helsing] A man with three gorgeous women for 400 years.
Yes, vampires are the walking dead.
It only makes sense their children are born dead.
He's obviously trying to bring them to life.
Ladies first.
Dracula and his brides only kill one or two people a month.
If he brings all these things to life...
-Throw the switches! -[Igor] Yes, Master.
-What are you doing? -I want to see what we're up against.
So this is what you get when vampires mate.
Come on!
They need to feed. Teach them how. Teach them!
And beg the Devil
that this time they stay alive.
-This is where I come in. -No, wait!
Now that I have your attention.
[Carl] Yes, well, that's interesting.
That's not good. Must warn somebody.
I can tell the character of a man by the sound of his heartbeat.
Usually when I approach
I can almost dance to the beat. [clapping]
Strange that yours is so steady.
[Igor in Hungarian] Hurry up!
We must keep the atmosphere electrified!
Accelerate the generators!
Power the dynamos!
We are losing power.
The human is insufficient.
Velkan.
Oh, my God.
Feed, my darlings! Feed!
[in Latin] May he rest in peace.
Hello, Gabriel.
We must not lose the master's progeny!
Is this your silver stake?
How long has it been, 300, 400 years?
You don't remember, do you?
Exactly what is it I should be remembering?
You are the great Van Helsing.
Trained by monks and mullahs from Tibet to Istanbul.
Protected by Rome herself.
But, like me, hunted by all others.
The Knights of the Holy Order know all about you.
It's no surprise you would know about me.
Yes, but it's much more than this. [laughing]
We have such history, you and I, Gabriel.
Have you ever wondered why you have such horrible nightmares?
Horrific scenes of ancient battles past.
How do you know me?
-Velkan. -Anna.
-Velkan. -Anna. No, no, no. Don't unstrap me. Don't unstrap me.
No, you must not! No! Stop!
Stop it. I'm getting you out of here.
Velkan, it's all right. I'm taking you home.
So would you like me to refresh your memory a little?
A few details from your sordid past.
Perhaps that is a conversation for another time.
Allow me to reintroduce myself.
I am Count Vladislaus Dragulia.
Born 1422.
Murdered 1462.
Help me!
I think we've overstayed our welcome.
-What happened? -They just died.
How can I ever repay you?
But you can't do that. You are a monk.
Well, actually I'm just a friar.
I am sorry, master. We try and we try,
I am sorry, master. We try and we try, but I fear we are not so smart as Dr. Frankenstein.
but I fear we are not so smart as Dr. Frankenstein.
Truly.
It would appear the good doctor took the key to life to his grave.
Hunt them down.
Kill them both.
[Anna] A silver stake? A crucifix?
What, did you think we haven't tried everything before?
We've shot him, stabbed him, clubbed him,
sprayed him with holy water, staked him through the heart,
and still he lives! Do you understand?
No one knows how to kill Dracula.
Well, I could have used that information a little earlier.
Don't give me that look.
You were right. I'm sorry.
He's not my brother anymore.
Do you have any family, Mr. Van Helsing?
Not sure. I hope to find out someday. That's what keeps me going.
-Here's to what keeps you going. -Absinthe. Strong stuff.
Don't let it touch your tongue. It'll knock you on your--
Vampires!
Now I remember.
"Even a man who is pure in heart And says his prayers by night
"may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms
"and the moon is shining bright.
"Or crave another's blood when the sun goes down
"and his body takes to flight"
There's something down here.
And it's carnivorous.
Whatever it is, it appears to be human.
I'd say he's a size 17. Around 360 pounds.
Eight and a half to nine feet tall.
Eight and a half to nine feet tall. He has a bad gimp in his right leg and three copper teeth.
He has a bad gimp in his right leg and three copper teeth.
How do you know he has copper teeth?
Because he's standing right behind you. Move!
Oh, my God! The Frankenstein monster!
Monster? Who's the monster here?
I have done nothing wrong
and yet you and your kind all wish me dead!
What do you want?
To exist.
Don't! -We must kill it. -Wait.
If you value your lives and the lives of your kind,
-you will kill me. -No.
If Dracula finds me.
I am the key to my father's machine.
The key to life.
Life for Dracula's children.
He already awakened them last night.
Two. And those were from only one bride.
From one single birthing.
And they died as they did the last time he tried.
Only with me can he give them lasting life.
There are more? More of those things?
Thousands.
Thousands more.
-No. -You heard what he said.
My life, my job is to vanquish evil.
I can, I can sense evil.
This thing, man, whatever it is,
evil may have created it, may have left its mark on it.
But evil does not rule it, so I cannot kill it.
-I can. -Not while I'm here.
Your family has spent 400 years trying to kill Dracula.
Maybe this poor creature can help us find a way.
Oh, my God. He's seen us.
Now they'll come for him,
and neither you nor I will be able to stop them.
If I can get him to Rome, we can protect him there.
And then the painting came alive
and the two creatures attacked each other.
-What does it mean? -I don't know.
Listen, Carl, whatever you do, don't stare at him.
I'm staring at him.
Is that a man?
Actually, it's seven men. Parts of them, anyway.
By exposing me, you have condemned me!
Me and all of humanity!
Nothing is faster than Transylvanian horses.
Not even a werewolf.
Anything else, you're on your own.
-Let me go. -Where are you going to go?
I don't know if you've looked in the mirror lately,
but you kind of stick out in a crowd.
We must not let the creature be destroyed!
[Aleera] Save him! Save the monster!
Stakes!
No!
-[Anna] Carl! -[Carl] Oh, my God.
-[Carl] What are you doing out here? -[Anna] Carl!
-[Carl] What are you doing out here? -[Anna] Carl! [Carl] Right, right.
Don't let go!
I can help! You won't kill me?
Only if you don't hurry!
Jump!
Velkan.
Velkan.
Anna.
Forgive me.
I will see you again.
You killed him. You killed him.
Now you know why they call me murderer.
Oh, my God. You've been bitten.
Anna!
Anna.
So much trouble to my master. So much trouble.
What do you want? The master commands a trade.
The monster for the Princess.
Somewhere public. Lots of people.
A place where your master will be less inclined to expose his other side.
Tomorrow night is All Hallows' Eve.
Here in Budapest, there is a wonderful masquerade ball.
-Are you all right? -No.
He has been bitten. Bitten by a werewolf.
Now you will become that which you have hunted so passionately.
I am sorry.
May others be as passionate in their hunting of you.
Well, they won't find him in here.
I'm sure this is some sort of sin.
Don't worry, God will forgive us. We need to save Anna.
You don't think the hat's a bit much, do you?
-Carl, help me! -Oh, right.
How many commandments can we break in one day?
Anyway, according to the book you won't turn into a werewolf until the rising of your first full moon.
you won't turn into a werewolf until the rising of your first full moon.
That's two nights from now.
Even then, you'll still be able to fight Dracula's hold over you
until the final stroke of midnight.
Sounds like I have nothing to worry about.
My God, you should be terrified.
-[Van Helsing] Thank you. -Sorry.
Well, we still have 48 hours to find a solution.
You sure he can't get out of there?
Not without some help from the dead.
How does it feel to be a puppet on my string?
I won't let you trade me, Count.
I have no intention of trading you.
And if I know Van Helsing, which I do,
he is not planning on making a trade, either.
Neither of us has ever settled for half.
Ah, there they are.
You make my skin crawl.
This is not all I could do with your skin.
Carl, I need you to do something.
I'm not gonna like this, am I?
Don't we make a lovely couple?
Oh, my God. I am looking for a new bride, Anna.
Someone strong and beautiful.
One brief moment of pain,
and we can be together forever.
You have no heartbeat.
Perhaps it just needs
to be rekindled.
Anna. Anna!
Wake up.
[Dracula] Gabriel.
Oh, Gabriel.
Oh, Gabriel.
Welcome to my summer palace.
Master, Master! Look, Master, look!
We have him, Master. We have him.
You wretched undead!
I shall have my revenge!
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
"I shall fear no evil!"
You are nothing but damned bones
and damned souls,
and will burn in the flames of Hell!
Now that everything is as it should be,
ladies and gentlemen, I give to you,
Van Helsing!
Come on. Come on!
Yes!
Now I know what it's for.
Now I know what it's for. -Where are we going? -[both] Through that window!
-Where are we going? -[both] Through that window!
Carl, you're a genius!
A genius with access to unstable chemicals.
Say goodbye to your friends.
I'll find you! I'll get you back and set you free!
I swear to God!
-I must save him. -No, you can't.
Why?
I cabled Rome earlier to apprise them of our situation.
-What did they say? -Even if you somehow kill Dracula,
Rome orders you to destroy Frankenstein as well.
He isn't evil. Yes, but they say he isn't human, either.
Do they know him? Have they talked with him? Who are they to judge?
They want you to destroy him so he can never be used to harm humanity.
And what of me? Did you tell them what I'm to become?
Did they tell you how to kill me?
The correct angle of the stake
-as it enters my heart? -[Anna] No!
The exact measure of silver in each bullet? Huh?
-[Anna] Stop! -No, I left you out!
I'm sorry.
It's starting.
[Anna] They must have taken all the equipment to Dracula's lair.
Wherever that is.
Look, there's still time.
Dracula can't bring his children to life until the sun sets.
The sun sets in two hours. We've been looking for him for more than 400 years!
Yes, well, I wasn't around for those 400 years, now, was I?
[Van Helsing] All right, Carl, what have you learned?
That Count Dracula was actually the son of Valerious the Elder.
The son of your ancestor. Everybody knows that. What else?
Everybody knows that. What else? All right. Well, according to this rubbing
All right. Well, according to this rubbing
it all started when Dracula was murdered.
-Do you know who murdered him? -No, no, no,
there's just some vague reference to the Left Hand of God.
And in 1462, when Dracula died,
-he made a covenant with the Devil. -And was given a new life.
But the only way he could sustain that life
was by drinking the blood of others.
Excuse me. Are you going to let me tell the story?
[both] Sorry.
And your ancestor, having sired this evil creature,
went to Rome to seek forgiveness. That's when the bargain was made.
He was to kill Dracula in return for eternal salvation of his entire family
in return for eternal salvation of his entire family
right down the line, all the way to you.
[Anna] But he couldn't do it.
As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor couldn't kill his own son.
So he banished him to an icy fortress
sending him through a door from which there was no return.
-And then the Devil gave him wings. -Yes.
-All right, so where is this door? -I don't know.
But when your ancestor couldn't kill his son, he left clues.
So that future generations might do it for him.
That must be what my father was looking for in here.
Clues to the door's location.
The door.
The door. Of course.
You said your father spent hours
staring at this painting, trying to find Dracula's lair.
I think you were right. Quite literally. I think this is the door. He just didn't know how to open it.
I think this is the door. He just didn't know how to open it.
Look. A Latin inscription.
Maybe it works like that painting in the tower.
If this were a door, my father would have opened it long ago.
I can't finish the inscription. There's a piece missing.
-Your father didn't have this. -Where did you get that?
-Your father didn't have this. -Where did you get that? Carl, finish it.
In the name of God, open this door.
A mirror.
Dracula has no reflection in the mirror. But why?
Maybe, maybe to Dracula it's not a mirror at all.
It's cold. And it's snowing.
See you on the other side.
Be careful.
Castle Dracula.
[Carl] Do we have a plan?
It doesn't have to be Wellington's at Waterloo,
but some sort of plan would be nice.
[Van Helsing] We're going to go in there and stop Dracula.
[Anna] And kill anything that gets in our way.
[Carl] Well, you let me know how that goes.
Well, as grateful as I am to be out of the cold,
that doesn't seem like a good thing.
We'd better get moving.
-[Carl] So are all of those-- -[Anna] Yes.
-[Carl] And inside them are-- -[Van Helsing] Yes.
[Igor] Igor do this! Igor do that!
How did you find... It's impossible!
-Please don't kill me! -Why not?
Well, I...
My master has awakened.
-There is a cure. -What?
Dracula. He has a cure to remove the curse of the werewolf!
Go, find the cure! Save yourself!
Come on. You heard him. Let's find it.
Wait. Why does Dracula have a cure?
-I don't care! -I do.
Why does he need one? Why?
Because the only thing that can kill him is a werewolf.
The painting. That's what it meant.
But Dracula's been using werewolves to do his bidding for centuries.
Yes, but if one ever had the will to turn on him, he'd need a cure
Yes, but if one ever had the will to turn on him, he'd need a cure to remove the curse and make him human before it bit him.
to remove the curse and make him human before it bit him.
You're going to take these two -and lead them to the antidote. -No, I'm not.
-and lead them to the antidote. -No, I'm not.
Yes, I am.
Here's the plan. When the bell begins to toll midnight,
you'll be able to kill Dracula.
We just need to find the cure and get it into you before the final stroke.
Are you insane? What kind of plan is that?
If they even suspect you of misleading them...
Clip off one of his fingers. -I'll clip off something. -The tower over there,
-I'll clip off something. -The tower over there, -that's where it is. -And what about the other tower?
-that's where it is. -And what about the other tower?
-Give me that! -That is where we reassembled the laboratory. Would I lie to you?
we reassembled the laboratory. Would I lie to you?
Not if you wanted to live.
Now, if I'm not cured by the twelfth stroke of midnight...
-I don't think I could. -You must.
Come on.
I don't like this plan. We don't have a choice. Just don't get killed.
We don't have a choice. Just don't get killed. You still don't understand.
It doesn't matter what happens to me.
We must save my family.
If you're late, run like hell.
Don't be late.
[whispering] Now go. Go. Go.
[monster] Get off me, you vermin from hell!
What are you complaining about? This is why you were made!
To prove that God is not the only one who can create life!
And now you must give that life to my children.
Up!
There it is.
I'll go first.
[Anna] Carl!
Stay as long as you like.
You try to get Igor. Igor get you! [laughing]
-Go ahead. Grab it. -You go ahead and grab it.
-Go ahead. Grab it. -You go ahead and grab it. If there's one thing I've learned
it's never to be the first to stick your hand in a viscous material.
-Did I scare you? -No.
Then maybe I need to try a little harder.
Viscous material! What did I tell you?
Get it! Get it!
Ooh, hot. Hot, hot, hot.
-Come on! -Yes. We've got to get the antidote to Van Helsing! Go! Go!
We've got to get the antidote to Van Helsing! Go! Go!
You can't go until I say you can go! Keep running, Carl!
Come here! And I'll say you can go when you're dead!
[Carl] Oh, my God!
What are you doing? You must find the cure!
-My friends are doing it for me. -Friends.
-My friends are doing it for me. -Friends. Yes. You want one?
I can't unscrew the bolts. This is gonna hurt.
I am accustomed to pain.
It lets you know you're alive.
Give me life!
One more bolt and my young will live.
[Van Helsing] You're almost out, my friend!
Help me!
But you're supposed to die.
I want to live.
All right!
Be happy in the knowledge
that I shall weep over your dead body.
Hang on!
I'll swing you loose!
You are too late, my friend.
My children live.
Then the only way to kill them is to kill you. Correct.
So be it.
One.
No, this cannot be.
We are both part of the same grand game, Gabriel.
But we need not find ourselves on opposite sides of the board.
[monster] Go! Go and help Van Helsing!
Now! Thank you.
Oh, my God! Anna, I need a little help!
Hurry!
Throw it to me, Carl!
Yes!
You are being used, Gabriel, as was I.
You are being used, Gabriel, as was I. But I escaped. So can you.
But I escaped. So can you.
Anna, my love, it is your blood that shall keep me beautiful.
What do you think of that?
I think if you're going to kill someone, kill them.
Don't stand there talking about it.
Don't you understand?
We could be friends.
Partners!
Brothers-in-arms!
Did I mention that it was you who murdered me?
It must be such a burden. Such a curse
It must be such a burden. Such a curse to be the Left Hand of God.
All I want is life, Gabriel.
The continuation of my kind.
And perhaps the return of my ring.
Don't be afraid, Gabriel. Don't be afraid.
I shall give you back your life, your memory.
Some things are better left forgotten. [groaning]
For God!
You've promised us new drugs to fight everything from the common cold to cancer.
And we'll deliver everything that we promised. I'm sorry, Gordon, but the adventure is over.
We are exercising our option to liquidate
Byron & Mitchell Research Limited.
Jack...show these people how filthy rich we're gonna make them, please.
Gordon, I don't think you understand what I just said.
Oh, I think I understand.
Jack.
JACK: Perrinia immortalis.
The Blood Orchid.
First described in 1892 by Houghton,
the last person to see it, until our exploratory team brought a sample back from Borneo.
The Blood Orchid lies dormant for seven years and then blooms for just six months.
Which means we just got lucky as hell, gentlemen.
JACK: I don't suppose anyone here is familiar with the Hayflick limit?
Hayflick proposed that a cell could only replicate 56 times
before it died from a buildup of toxins.
According to him, it's the reason that we die.
But what if we could transcend that limit?
That would be impossible.
Not according to our data.
Our research indicates the presence of a chemical in perrinia immortalis
that can significantly prolong cellular life.
GAIL: I can't support this.
Does that mean what I think it means?
Are we talking about a pharmaceutical equivalent
to the fountain of youth?
Exactly.
That'd be bigger than Viagra.
Have you put this into human trials? We can't...yet.
Our sample was degraded in the initial study. We need more of the orchid.
We need more of the orchid.
See, and that's our only problem, gentlemen.
That orchid is only in bloom for another two weeks.
Well, what the hell are you waiting for?
Get your asses down to Borneo.
Yes.
Welcome to Borneo. Thanks.
What's wrong with this picture? I don't know. Let me see. You're in it?
We don't have a boat, okay?
Your company's had one responsibility, to get a boat,
and you've already managed to screw it up. Wait, wait, wait a minute. Your girl chartered the boat, not us.
No, no. Sam confirmed with the company last night. They're still waiting for your payment.
SAM: Hey.
Hey, I've got something. Payment cleared.
Really?
Where's the boat? It's not coming.
All of the charter companies have shut down.
No one'll risk goin' upriver until after the rainy season.
And when's that? Two, three weeks.
The orchid's only in bloom for one more week, tops.
There's a local captain named Jin-Soon.
I'm told he'll take anyone upriver, for the right price.
Are you sure this is the place?
They said the one with the red door.
I'll bet you any kind of money there's somebody playing Russian roulette in there.
Well, maybe we'll get lucky and they'll give you a turn.
JACK: Hey, why don't you two just get a room? Come on, Sam.
Wait here.
Yeah, if you insist.
Hey. Hey.
Jin-Soon.
Jin-Soon?
Your Indonesian sucks.
Stick to English. We heard you could take us upriver.
In rainy season?
Won't be cheap. We can pay you 25,000.
We can pay you 25,000.
I'll have a talk with the captain. Well, you mean you're not the captain?
Jin-Soon!
These tourists need a boat. I told them not in the rainy season.
You're Jin-Soon? Local nickname. Name's Johnson.
Name's Johnson. Bill Johnson.
It's a pronunciation thing.
And you can rent my boat for 25 grand.
Now...you want me to drive it, well...
that'll cost you 50.
Fifty grand? Are you high?
You know what? Please don't answer that question.
You know what? Please don't answer that question. There's no way I'm trusting this guy with the expedition.
Listen, lady. Let's cut the bullshit, please.
If one of the other charter companies could take you,
you'd be on the river by now.
You only came to me because you're desperate.
Fifty grand's my price.
Take it...
or leave it.
I've seen subway cars in better shape than this.
Yeah, she may be ugly...
but she puts out.
Ah, shit. What took you so long?
Hey, you try gettin' a GPS locator, a Sat-Nav EchoStar, and a UV spectrometer
a Sat-Nav EchoStar, and a UV spectrometer past Indonesian customs.
Complaining already. Yeah.
Rather be back in the office? Hell, yeah.
Girl, I had courtside seats at the Garden Saturday night.
I was gonna sit right between Spike and Woody.
Oh, man, is that our ride?
Look at the bright side, Cole. At least the weather's nice.
Ben Douglas. Team doctor. You must be Sam.
Yeah. We spoke on the phone.
Glad to have you aboard.
I'm gonna get you for this.
BEN: Oh, yeah. This could be fun.
You can forget about that, dog.
That's one car you ain't never gonna catch.
There's always a way.
Your team's a little green, huh? My former grad students.
Best in their field.
Here's a tip for Wexell-Hall.
You want the best young talent, recruit early.
GAIL: Yes, I'm sure Sam's very talented.
I think I resent that.
You and the other gal can stay in here.
You live here?
The way you say that, I can tell you're impressed.
All right.
If you need anything...
Well, if you need anything, you're shit out of luck.
Okay.
Now, this is where the exploratory team found the orchid.
In the Selatan Basin.
It took them three days to get upriver. Yeah.
Well, that was before the rainy season.
Some of these waterways could be dangerous now.
could be dangerous now. You said you could get us there safely.
And I will, but safe isn't always quick.
We'll work our way upriver one bend at a time.
If I don't like what I see, we change course. You can't chart the fastest route
You can't chart the fastest route before you begin.
Already have.
Check it. A'ight.
Now, we're uplinked in real time to NASA and AsiaSatCom.
Now, under ideal conditions, [TYPING] this is the fastest route,
this is the fastest route,
but once we superimpose weather patterns for the past 10 years
for the past 10 years and then extrapolate...
Bingo. It's Padrang to the Selatan Basin.
I'm a bad man.
Look, we got less than a week to get to that orchid.
If you can't get the job done... give us our money back
and we'll get somebody who can. I'll get you there.
God help me.
Something attacked me! Something is in there!
Oh, my God! Man, she said something attacked her.
No, no, no, no!
BILL [GENTLY]: It's okay, boy. It's okay.
What the hell did you do? You scared him.
I scared him?
This is Kong.
This is Kong. Kong lives here.
You're... guests.
Be nice.
Disgusting animal.
Uh, you-- You okay now?
I'm fine. Just keep your hands off of me.
Oh, yeah, well, it's gonna be tough, but, uh, I'll try.
No, the S-1 has to be on file before the week is out. Hello! Yeah.
No, I don't care. That's the whole point. Hello?
Hello? The S-1 needs to be on file before the week is out. We were able to get on the river.
That's the whole purpose. We need the comments back from the SEC.
Uh-huh. Yeah. Excuse me. I'm trying. It's the only place I get reception.
No, just get it done. We need to be ready to go, effective as-- Three, four days.
Hello? Hello? Hello! Bob. Damn it. Damn.
Try my phone.
Works just as good, but it's free.
Oh, okay. Okay, maybe you can use my special antenna, to boost your reception.
JACK: We're dealing with a lithophytic vine, so we want to search any rock face.
Now, this ridge here seems a good bet. Sam.
Sam.
Come on, Sam.
What do you say? We're young, we're single. We're in Borneo.
What do you got to lose?
You're not satisfied, you walk away, no commitments.
"No commitments."
That's your pitch?
Did I say, "No commitments"? I meant, "Marry me."
Am I gonna be dealing with this for the next two weeks?
Yep.
So you were one of Jack's students?
Yeah. He was teaching a seminar on botanical pharmacology.
Soon as I finished my dissertation, he hired me.
Well, that's one way to get a leg up.
What's that supposed to mean?
I had a professor who wanted to hire me right out of school.
who wanted to hire me right out of school. Of course, he wanted me to be his secretary.
Look, if I've done something to offend you in any way--
No. No, dear, not at all.
Actually, I admire you. Took me 10 years to get where I am.
Clearly, your generation has it figured out.
Man. This is good, man. Where'd you learn to cook like this?
It's just a little recipe I picked up in Sri Lanka. What were you doing there?
Doctors Without Borders.
It's my day job.
You guys expect to need a doctor for some reason?
Can't get the expedition bonded without one.
Can't get the expedition bonded without one. Well, you just think of me as a charming insurance policy.
Hey!
You've had your dinner.
Get outta here.
Ah. What'd I say?
COLE: I'm serious. I'm not sleeping up here tonight...
I ain't sleeping with no damn monkey.
Oh, shit. What was that? What the hell was that?
Something's getting eaten. By what?
Everything gets eaten out here.
It's the jungle.
Kong.
Hey, you guys seen Kong? No.
Not since last night.
Where are you?
Kong. Ch-ch-ch-ch.
We need those results by next month if we want the FDA off our backs.
Hello? H-- Shit.
I can't hear you.
Can you hear me now?
How about now?
[SHOUTING] Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now? We can.
Can you hear me now?
Oh, shit! Gail, oh, my God. Shit.
Stop the boat!
I'll go. All right.
Hey, Gail! Can you hear me now?
Oh. Oh, I'm going to kill you!
COLE: Stroke, Gail, stroke! Come on!
BILL: Watch your back. Come on, stroke! MITCHELL: Hey, Gail! How's the water?
Maybe you should drop the phone. It's probably holding you back.
All right. Stay calm, Gail. Come on.
Stay calm, Gail. Come on. MITCHELL: Use your phone as a flotation device.
JACK: All right, come on, Gail.
You're almost there, Gail. MITCHELL: Come on, it's just like a phone.
I got it.
Holy shit! Holy shit!
Come on! Come on!
Get out! SAM: Hurry up!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Come on! Come on! Gail, grab it!
Look out! Look out!
Oh, my God!
COLE: Get him, man! Get him, man! Get him in the eye, man!
Bill?
Where'd he go?
Bill! Where'd he go?
I don't see him. Where's he gone?
Where's he gone? Oh, my God.
Oh, shit, you won!
You okay? I lost my phone.
Sorry to hear it.
That was either the bravest... or the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
It's a fine line.
Good as new. Thanks.
To Gail...
who knows it's better to eat than be eaten.
Yeah, yeah, baby. To Gail. To Gail.
Almost eaten just to find a flower.
Hardly seems worth it. Oh, it's worth it.
I mean, think about it, right?
A pill that you take every day for the rest of your life.
Now, even if we charge, say, a dollar a pop...
...we're billionaires.
COLE: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, baby. At $100 a bottle,
I'll dive in that river and fight that croc myself.
So how many flowers does it take to save the world?
We figure 50 orchids'll yield about an ounce of chemical.
You could have a football field full of those orchids.
Still doesn't mean you can get it through human trials. Phew.
She doesn't even believe in you. Comes with the territory.
Comes with the territory.
In research, you've got to go out on a limb, and there's always someone waiting to chop it off.
and there's always someone waiting to chop it off.
Where the hell have you been, huh?
Damn that thing. Where you been, boy?
[SQUAWKING] Calm down. Calm down.
Poor guy. It's okay. It's all right.
Looks like he's seen a ghost.
It's all right. It's all right. [WHIMPERING] It's all right. Shh.
SAM: What if Gail's right?
I mean, cells in a petri dish are one thing.
Human trials are another. She's wrong,
and when perrinia immortalis goes to product,
and you and I can cash in our stock options,
we'll rub her face in it. Stock options.
I spoke to Mitchell.
We're each giving you half a point.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
You deserve it.
All this...
wouldn't be possible without your work.
Jack.
Thought we decided against that.
Yeah. Yeah.
You're right. It would be fun, though.
I mean, here we are, traveling upriver
to the greatest discovery of our careers and...
Now, if this orchid thing works out, then...
who knows?
Is that why I'm here?
So you can give us one more try?
You're here because you're the best researcher I've got.
BILL: Am I interrupting something?
No. I was, um... I was just going to bed.
I was, um... I was just going to bed. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, before you do that, we need to talk.
We got a problem. See the water level?
Uh-huh.
In high water, the Mendranang gets rough. Now, what we could do is turn around
Now, what we could do is turn around and try to find another course,
but that would take at least two days. We don't have the time.
If the river becomes impassable, it's gonna take a lot longer.
And if we turn back, then we're definitely screwed. You're gonna have to risk it.
You're gonna have to risk it.
What if I don't wanna risk it?
Do you have any idea what this flower means? We're talking about the biggest medical discovery
We're talking about the biggest medical discovery in history. Wow.
That does sound great, Jack,
but I was never any good at history.
You want me to risk the Mendranang, it's gonna cost you an extra 50,000.
it's gonna cost you an extra 50,000.
Done.
Done?
Don't you gotta ask the boss lady or something?
I'll pay it myself.
All right.
You got yourself a deal.
But if we hit trouble,
your people do what I say, you got that?
You're the captain.
Research proposals?
Yeah, research proposals.
You're not the only company we're in bed with.
Yeah, but we're the prettiest and most popular.
It's like sleeping with the head cheerleader.
Not quite.
Come on, you know you love us.
I love your cash.
Then why don't you let me get a look at that file?
I mean, after this orchid thing goes bust, you're gonna be finished at Wexell-Hall.
Unless you got something else lined up.
You really wanna see us fail, don't you?
No.
I just think that you will. I am a scientist, you know.
Scientist.
What're you doing at Wexell-Hall?
I like science.
I just like money better.
I'll drink to that.
River's flooded. Can't see the banks.
Miss our turnoff?
It's just ahead.
What the hell was that?
Rudder's jammed. What? Watch out.
What? Watch out.
Shit!
Get up! Everybody, up!
Hey.
MITCHELL: What's going on?
BILL: Goddamn it.
Shit. I've blown that gasket.
Are we all right?
Hey, what's going on?
What is it? We got problems.
What's wrong, man? Bill...
Rudder's shot.
Son of a bitch. Current's too strong.
We missed our turnoff. I know. Come on, baby.
BEN: Come on, man.
MITCHELL: What is it? COLE: Wh-what is it?
MITCHELL: What do you see?
Come on.
You got this. Come on, girl.
Everybody, hang on! COLE: Hang on to what?!
Come on!
Oh!
Holy shit.
TRAN: It's sinking, it's sinking!
Where's Cole? Swim to the rocks, this way.
Where's Cole? Cole!
Where's Cole? Cole! Over there! Over... Over there.
Over there! Over... Over there.
COLE: Come on, man. Give me your hand!
JACK: Come on.
You got it, Sam. Come on.
Give me your hand. I've got you, I've got you. Whoa.
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.
Okay, I've got her.
You almost got us killed!
You think I wanted this? I just lost my damn boat!
You'll lose your payday if you don't get us outta this.
You said you'd get us there safely. If you knew it was that dangerous,
you should've turned around! That's enough!
There's nothing we can do about that now.
It's a waste of energy.
What have we got?
Some specimen jars, a map, a little water, no food.
Hard drive's ruined.
Well, pretty much all the equipment's shot.
Except one of the SAT phones still works. It's online.
Thank God we can call the police.
[SCOFFS] Police. The nearest river patrol is back in Padrang.
The only way to get to us is over that. Are you saying we're stuck here?
Are you saying we're stuck here?
Maybe not.
We're here, The valley's completely flooded.
But I got a friend who operates a boat on the Tokut River.
I can give him a call, and he can meet us here, at Naga Rock.
How far is that?
I don't know, a two-day hike down the river,
but if we bushwhack, we cut at least a day off the trek. Oh, my God, you wanna go through that?
Oh, my God, you wanna go through that? It's the shortest way.
It's the shortest way.
We could be safely in the Tokut by nightfall.
So we can continue with the expedition.
Yeah. I'll get you to the flower. I don't care about that flower.
Just get us to safety. It's the same thing.
Now, we can either be on my buddy's boat in 10 hours, or we can sit here
and wait for the river patrol for days.
Your friend. Is he reliable?
Absolutely.
BILL [OVER PHONE]: You better not screw me on this.
Sounds like you're already screwed, mate.
I'll pay you two grand.
I need you on this one, John.
Yes, yes, so it seems. Uh...
Look, uh, Billy, I'd love to help you out, but, uh... I'm flat out, mate, you know? Um...
probably squeeze you in for, say... five grand?
You're killing me. Ha, that's mates' rates.
Ha, that's mates' rates. Or you could always hike
back to Padrang if you wanna save bucks.
Up to you, pal. Fine. Five.
[WHISPERS] Yes. But you better be there.
Otherwise, I'll tell your wife about that little side trip to Bangkok.
Wife's long gone, Billy.
Long gone, mate.
All right, people, we're on. Saddle up.
Stay together. This jungle is all green all the time, and you will get lost.
It's like doing a StairMaster in a sauna.
Yeah. I might die of a heat stroke, but I'll have a nice tight ass.
That's the spirit, Cole.
You want me to grab that? Is that a trick question?
Here, man.
Right between Spike and Woody.
Right between Spike and Woody.
You okay, Sam?
I'm fine.
See, a crisis separates the real men from the pretenders.
Yeah. I can see that.
What, that? That's nothing.
That's nothing.
[PANTING] I tricked him into taking my bag.
Hey. Mind if I give it a try?
Knock yourself out.
Hey.
I'm sorry about your boat.
Yeah, well...
it was a piece of shit anyway.
Can we go around?
Yeah, we could. But we'd lose another day. GAIL: Aw.
Let's go.
GAIL: Shit.
Hey. Knock it off.
Shit! What--? What was that? What was what?
Something just moved. Oh, please don't say that.
No, I'm serious. Something just moved past me.
MITCHELL: Something just moved, as in something's alive? Yeah, man-- Shit! Shit!
Yo, there it is again. There's something in here.
Cole, there's probably a million things in here. BILL: He's right.
BILL: He's right. Just keep moving.
Stop it.
I swear to God, if you don't stop it...
Very funny.
Ben?
Where'd he go? Shit!
Help me!
Run!
COLE: What the hell was that thing? BILL: Anaconda. Oh, great!
GAIL: There's snakes out here that big?
Yes, but there's no w-- But what? That thing swallowed him whole!
Calm down and listen a second. No, no, no.
I can explain to you-- No, you calm down and listen! Ben was eaten by a freaking snake, okay?
A freaking snake! Cole. Oh, God! Oh, God!
Cole. Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God, I mean--
Cole. Oh, my God, did you--? Did you see that thing?
We don't got a chance against something like that!
I mean, Mitchell. Mitchell. Listen to me, man.
I watch the Discovery Channel, okay? I'm telling you. We got no chance! We got no chance!
We're like-- We're like mice in an aquarium.
We're gonna die, girl. We're gonna die!
We're gonna die! Cole, Cole. Calm down. Okay?
Okay? All right, Jack, I'm okay. Okay. Okay.
All right, Jack, I'm okay. Okay. Okay.
I'll just--
I'm-- I'm-- I'm gonna-- I'm gonna sit right here, I'm sorry. Sorry.
Listen. Anacondas are territorial.
A snake that size will hunt a huge area.
There won't be another one for miles.
We gotta get to the boat. It's not that far,
so if we keep moving and stick together,
we should be fine. "We should be"?
How big do they get?
That was the biggest one I've ever seen, by far. A freak of nature.
The odds of running into another one that size are astronomical.
Yeah, but how do we know that the one that got Ben
is not gonna come after us? It takes them weeks to digest.
It takes them weeks to digest.
Meal like that, he'll be sleeping it off for a while.
Let's just, um... get to that boat and get home.
What about the orchid?
You've gotta be kidding me.
It won't be in bloom for another seven years.
This expedition is over, Jack. Now, hold on a second, Gail.
There's a lot of money at stake here, okay? I don't care! Ben is dead!
We have lost someone.
As Wexell-Hall's representative, I am calling this expedition off.
You don't have the authority. Check your contract. In case you hadn't noticed,
we're in the middle of the jungle.
At this point, your authority is what we say it is.
Jack, I'm with her. I gotta get the hell outta here, man.
Look, Ben was my friend, okay? I got him into this,
and no one feels worse about it than I do.
I don't want to do anything stupid.
I just want to accomplish what we came here for.
If we turn back now, Ben's death would be for nothing.
Let's just get back to the boat.
We can regroup and make our decision then.
Fine.
[QUIETLY] Jack, maybe Gail's right.
[QUIETLY] Jack, maybe Gail's right. She's just scared.
Once we get back to the boat, she'll be okay.
When we get back to the boat, this expedition is over.
The only place I'm taking these people is to safety.
Hey, hey, hey. We had a deal.
Keep your money, doc. Someone is dead.
We're officially in over our heads.
You just said we won't run into another one of those things.
And we probably won't, but I can't guarantee it.
So I'll get you to the boat,
but after that, we're done.
Well, that answers it.
That answers nothing. I'll just throw more money at him when we get back to the boat.
If he doesn't take it, I'll offer his friend the same deal.
Jack, maybe we should listen-- Sam, if we don't get to that orchid now,
all of our work would've been for nothing.
I need your support, okay? You have as much riding on this as I do.
Don't let me down.
COLE: I saw this special on Animal Planet. Anacondas are vicious, man. I mean, they hunt for sport.
They don't even need to see you to eat you.
They use their flicking tongues to sense your body heat. GAIL: Will you shut the hell up?
GAIL: Will you shut the hell up? I knew this guy who knew this other guy
I knew this guy who knew this other guy who used to shoot documentaries,
and he went down to the Amazon with this crew once, they were all eaten by snakes, and that's a true story.
You knew a guy who knew a guy, that's a urban myth.
I'm sorry about Ben.
I never should've stayed on the Mendranang.
What do you mean? Well, I figured he didn't tell the others,
Well, I figured he didn't tell the others, but I thought you knew.
Knew what?
Byron offered me an extra 50 grand to stay on the river.
I told him it might get rough, but he wanted to risk it.
[SCOFFS] Hey. Don't blame him.
It was my call.
I took the money.
I thought I could get us through.
You want to blame anyone? You blame me.
MITCHELL: These boots are killing me.
Cole. What?
You got some...
Oh! Oh, God, what is that! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!
Oh, my God! I can't get it off!
Help me! Help me! Help me! All right, hold on. Hey!
Get this off me! Calm down! Calm down.
Calm down! Calm down.
Cole! Cole!
Calm down. What is it? What is it?
Get it off. Get it off. All right, look-- Get it off.
Just a lighter. Oh, no! You ain't burning me. Just a lighter.
COLE: Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
You burn me, I'll kill you. Shh. Shh.
Shh. Shh. Okay. Okay. All right.
All right? You okay? Yeah. I'm fine.
BILL: Uh... COLE: What? BILL: Hold on. Put your arms up.
Put your arms up. What are you doing?
Why are you going under my shirt?
BILL: Jesus. COLE: "Jesus" what?
What? What is it?
What is it? What is it?
Anybody got a blowtorch?
Stop.
Careful.
What's... If that thing bit you,
you would be lumpuh.
Paralyzed like stone for two days.
JACK: What do you call this fellow? Laba laba batu. Stone spider.
We may have just discovered a valuable new anesthetic agent for Wexell-Hall.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Forget Wexell. We can get this to the highest bidder.
All right. Show and tell's over.
We gotta get to that boat. Put your boots on and let's go.
Bugger it.
What the hell was that?
Holy bloody hell.
COLE: Whoa! Wh-what was that?
Oh, my God.
What the hell was that?
Come on.
COLE: No, no, no, no! Oh, come on, man!
What the hell happened?
Livingston!
JACK: Here we go.
He got drunk and fell off the bloody boat!
Your friend! Your friend! Now, what we gonna do now?
COLE: Shit!
Search the wreckage.
Find anything we can use...
and hope to God there's a phone.
Aw, come on, come on.
Aw, come on, come on. Yes.
COLE: Hello?
Hello?
Come on, come on. Anything? Nothing.
Keep trying.
What do you think I'm doing, Jack?
Hello? Shit.
Hello? Come on, man.
Hello?
MITCHELL: All right, keep looking!
No phone? Nothing.
Nothing. Couldn't get a signal on the radio.
Now what?
COLE: What's going on?
BILL: Where'd these come from?
Lopaks. Who?
Local tribe,
descended from headhunters. What?
Been in this region for thousands of years.
Headhunters? There's still some villages around here.
Yeah, this must be one of their fishing spots. No. Excuse me. Did you say headhunters?
No. Excuse me. Did you say headhunters?
There haven't been practicing headhunters in Borneo for over a century.
Yeah, well, just because they ain't practicing, don't mean they don't remember how.
They must be along this branch of the river.
If we can find their village... maybe they can lend us a boat.
COLE: So wait a minute. We just gonna walk towards the headhunters, not away?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
Oh, God. I'm so hungry, I'd sell my grandmother for a Tic Tac.
You mention food one more time,
I'm voting you off this island.
MITCHELL: Oh, God.
Is that--? Livingston.
Oh, my God, man. What the...? What the hell happened to him?
Anaconda.
If he was eaten by the snake, then why is his body--?
If he was eaten by the snake, then why is his body--? Listen, listen, listen!
All right. These things are at their weakest when they digest,
but if threatened, they will spit up their food and attack again.
COLE: What? Are you telling me there's some snake out there with an empty stomach?
Yeah. The same one that got Ben?
No. No. There's no way that snake could've gotten to Livingston.
It had to be another one. Another one? You said there wouldn't be another for miles--
There wouldn't.
Unless... Unless what?
Unless it's mating season. Oh, my God.
Mating season? Yeah. Oh, my God.
You see, the males are territorial, but when they smell a female in heat,
they come running... from everywhere.
TRAN: Females find a nice, wet, muddy pit, and they all go after her at once.
in one big mating ball. So you're telling me
there's some snake orgy out in the jungle?
Yeah. Something like that.
Look, we're losing the light.
All we gotta do is get to that village, so please, pay attention.
Do not... stray from the group.
Let's go.
TRAN: Stay quiet. Sacred burial ground.
Jesus.
I thought you said that anaconda was the biggest you'd ever seen.
It was.
Well, this one's... Bigger.
The males must've come through here looking for the female.
Some bullshit.
They took their boats. BEN: Good for them,
bad for us.
Which one's the Mendranang? On the right.
On the right. The Tokut keeps going to the left.
Fastest way to Kotabaru. How long?
You'll be soaking in a hot tub at the Four Seasons in two days.
How, man? We don't even have a boat.
We're gonna build one.
Man, do that in my neighborhood, and that's your ass.
Shit.
Sam.
What does this look like to you?
My God.
Perrinia immortalis.
Now we know why these snakes are so big.
What?
Anacondas keep growing till they die, right? Uh-huh. And these are the biggest snakes
Uh-huh. And these are the biggest snakes Bill's ever seen.
Because they're living longer. Exactly,
because perrinia immortalis is part of the food chain.
These snakes have transcended the Hayflick limit.
The chemical in the orchid does exactly what we predicted,
and not in theory. In the real world.
This is proof, Sam, of your research, carved in stone.
This is proof?
It's anecdotal evidence at best.
Let's get to the orchid and find out. You are out of your mind. Do you have any idea how close we are?
Do you have any idea how close we are?
The orchid was found here, on the Mendranang,
just around the next bend.
We'll be going right past it. No, we won't.
No, we won't. We are going down the Tokut.
If we continue down the Mendranang, it's gonna be a week
before we reach another village. I'm not waiting that long for my bath.
Yeah, well, it's not up to you.
Jack.
Maybe we can just come back.
Come back?
In seven years? What if it's not here?
What if some local farmer decides to slash and burn the entire basin? Instead of the fountain of youth,
Instead of the fountain of youth, we'll have a giant rice paddy.
This is our only chance. You know it is.
Do you really wanna give in, now we're this close?
Look... you know I got your back, right?
We've been in the trenches a hundred times together...
but I'm not going in that jungle. Damn straight, man.
Thank you.
This is my expedition, and we're going to the orchid.
No.
We're not.
Don't be an idiot, Sam.
This is bigger than penicillin, for God's sake. Your lives will be saved by this drug.
Your lives will be saved by this drug.
People will live longer, we'll stay young longer.
If we don't put this to human trials, it's gonna be a crime against humanity.
Two people have died already.
Scientists have always risked their lives to change the world.
If they didn't, we wouldn't have cures for yellow fever, polio and smallpox.
We all knew the risks. We thought we did,
until you decided to start making decisions behind our backs.
What're you talking about? He offered Bill an extra 50 grand to keep going up the Mendranang,
to keep going up the Mendranang, even though he knew it wasn't safe.
[QUIETLY] Oh, my God.
Is that true, Jack?
I was thinking of the expedition. You were thinking of your career.
Look... ...you're my assistant.
I don't need to consult you!
I'm the one with authority here.
We're in the middle of the jungle, Jack.
At this point, your authority is what we say it is.
Guess you got a mutiny on your hands.
Thank you.
Okay. Keep it high.
Careful.
Center it right here.
All right.
What're you doing?
Never seen a man shave before?
Probably a lot sharper before you attacked that alligator.
Crocodile.
What's that mean?
That means "a new beginning." It's Korean.
I got it when I was in the military.
What brought you here?
Long story. Where am I gonna go?
All right.
Here's the deal. I was in the Special Forces.
And I saw and did things that...
and did things that... I wanted to forget.
Sometimes we do the wrong things for the right reasons, you know?
That's not very long, as stories go.
Yeah.
Well...I got out of the military,
came here, and bought The Bloody Mary.
Just wanted to... start a new life.
Thank you, Jack.
TRAN: On three. Ready?
TRAN: On three. Ready? One, two, three.
It works. Whoo!
SAM: All right.
Let me explain.
Why in the hell didn't you tell me about this?
The minute someone makes a call,
this expedition's over.
Exactly.
All I'm asking for is a few more hours.
We continue on the Mendranang,
take our orchid samples, then we call for help.
Forget about it, Jack, all right? I'm getting us outta here.
Think about this, Gordon.
You're about to become a billionaire. Do you really wanna give all that up?
I don't care about the money, all right?
I want to live.
[GASPS] It bit me.
Jack, what're you--?
What're you...?
[WEAKLY] Help.
Help.
SAM: Where's Mitchell?
Resting his feet.
Should I go get him? No, no.
Let him rest till we get everything loaded. Okay.
Those blisters are pretty nasty.
Mitchell.
You okay?
Mitchell?
What is it?
[GAGS] Tell me.
What did you do to him, Jack?
What is it? Something's wrong with Mitchell.
What're you talking about? You were in there alone with him.
What did you do?
He was resting his feet. I didn't do anything.
Shit. Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Gail, no! Stop!
Get out! No! No! Get out! Go!
COLE: Come on! Come on!
COLE: Move! Go!
The raft!
COLE: Nooooo! You son of a bitch!
We can build another one.
With what? With what, Sam?
BILL: We gotta get to the raft.
It's our only way outta here. FYI, Bill, the raft is gone!
We can get it back. How? Huh?
How? We gonna-- We gonna swim after it now?
Look.
The village is here.
Jack is following the Mendranang.
We cut across the jungle.
We can catch him on the other side. Right.
Catch him where? He's going to that orchid.
We find that flower...
...we find that raft.
Oh, thank God. It's, uh... It's Jack Byron.
Listen, something terrible has happened. We-- We took the wrong way on the Mendranang.
We-- We took the wrong way on the Mendranang.
We-- We went over a waterfall.
I haven't seen anyone since. I am...
I think I'm the only one left.
Wait, wait. Shh, shh. Listen.
Oh, shit. Come on!
It's in front of us.
Son of a bitch. It's trying to separate us.
Oh, shit.
Oh, Christ, it's everywhere. [WHISPERS] Turn that goddamn thing off. They can see it.
[WHISPERS] Turn that goddamn thing off. They can see it. Doesn't matter. They can sense our body heat.
Doesn't matter. They can sense our body heat. He's right. Let's just get the hell outta here.
He's right. Let's just get the hell outta here.
Which way? Hold on.
Any way! Which way?
Which way? Okay, okay, okay! Wait for me!
Okay, okay, okay! Wait for me! Come on!
Hold on, wait for me!
Oh. Oh, my God.
If there's a way in, there's a way out.
Oh, shit!
Guys?
Which way?
Which way? GAIL: Over here!
GAIL: Over here! All right, say it again! Say it again! Cole! Over here!
Over here! Cole!
Hello?
Guys?
Oh, God.
Come on.
Cole!
No, no, no, no! No!
Stay together.
O-- Okay. I promise. Now, can we please go?
Let's go. No problem. Okay. Okay.
Which way?
I don't know. What?
What do you mean, you don't know?
I found you, didn't I?
Tran?
Tran!
Tran!
Say something!
Oh, shit! Guys! Guys!
I can see light.
Is it a way out? I don't know.
Cole!
Tran!
Can you hear me?
Cole!
Where are you?
I think I found a way out.
Take this. Go. Now.
Where are they? Go.
Oh, my God.
Go.
COLE: Help! Cole?
Hey! Cole? Hey, right here!
Almost there.
Holy shit!
Move! It's coming up my ass!
Help me! What did I do?
Wait. Cole!
Cole! Come on!
Give me your hand. Come on! Oh, God! I'm stuck!
Give me your-- I'm stuck! All right. I'm stuck!
Pull me, man! Hurry up! Come on!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's coming! It's coming!
That's what I'm talking about! That's what I'm talking about, Sam!
Oh, my God! You're the bomb, Sam! You Lorena Bobbitt-ed that ass!
How you like her now, bitch? Huh?
She sliced you! She diced you! She cut you up!
That was like Sam with the samurai action!
Hell, no.
Cole!
Get up, Cole. Get up, man. Wake up.
Come on, man. Wake up.
No. No. No. No.
SAM: He's not breathing.
Give him air! Give him air!
Okay. Okay.
Again! Again!
Come on, wake up! Don't you die! [SOBBING] Don't die!
[SOBBING] Don't die! Come on, no!
What the fuck?! Get it off me!
Keep him down! No, no, no! It's okay! It's okay!
You're okay. I'm okay?
Yeah. Yeah. You're okay.
Perrinia immortalis.
Son of a bitch finally got his orchid. SAM: Yeah, he can have 'em.
All I care about is that raft.
Let's go.
Oh, my God. Thank God.
I think I know what happened to Mitchell.
I can't let you take that.
You guys look like hell.
You don't know what hell is. Oh, I'm sorry,
but you gave me no choice. Did you give Mitchell a choice before you killed him?
Did you give Mitchell a choice before you killed him? I didn't kill Mitchell.
No.
You just let him die.
I saw the spider bite on his arm.
What was I supposed to do, Sam? Huh?
The right thing? It's always a good place to start.
Let's not be stupid about this.
Let's get to the flower, and we can all go home.
The mating ball.
Gimme the flare.
Tie him up.
Now!
Fill it up. You gotta be kidding me.
Do I look like I'm kidding? Fill it up!
Get up!
Now get the flowers! [SOBS] Okay.
Throw me the pack.
Drop the gun!
Throw me the pack.
COLE: Get up, Bill! Get up!
Come on, man!
Get up!
Get up!
Sam! Sam! Come on! Come on!
Come on, come on, girl! Hurry up! Come on! Come on!
GAIL: Sam, come on! Hurry up, hurry up! Sam!
Come on! Come on! Come on, baby, come on! Aah!
Shit!
Come on, baby! You got it! Come on!
You're almost there!
Spider. Reach for me!
Come on, Sam, please! Just reach! Reach!
Give me your hand.
Come on! Right here!
COLE: No! No!
Oh, my God!
Come on, Sam! Come on!
Keep coming!
Climb on that log, Sam!
Keep coming! Come on, girl!
Come on! I got you!
Come on, Sam!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh!
Hey!
Over here, bitch!
Holy shit.
Nice shot.
What can I say? I'm a bad man.
I'm a bad man.
Wow, you two look like you made up.
He's not so bad.
How's that?
Much better.
I think I'll live.
Good.
It's kinda nice having you around.
So... how much further to my bath?
Kotabaru? I'd say...
another day downriver. Whoa, another day?
Oh, I'm not rowing another day, homeboy. BILL: All right.
I don't care if you're a man or a woman.
All I know is that I love you.
What's next?
Move in with me.
Great, I'll move in tomorrow.
But I won't live downstairs.
Every night, I want to sleep with your arms around me.
Promise?
Silly girl.
It's a deal then.
What's the matter?
The elevator is stuck again!
Didn't you say that you would be fine with me around?
DAY 1 OF LIVING TOGETHER...
-Put it here. -Don’t sit there!
Sam, why aren't you helping out?
-I thought you lived in the outskirts. -That's right!
But it feels like you're bringing an entire shopping mall.
Hey, watch out!
Who are these people?
Nothing tops my number one idol.
ROSE FAN LAST TANGO
Hey, where have you been?
Awesome.
This is amazing!
Hey, I'm not a delivery boy.
I'm actually moving in.
Where's the kitchen?
-Last door to your left. -All right.
That's Fish, my best friend.
Do you remember him?
Sam, today is June 10.
Right now, it's 3:40 p.m.
From now on, we'll start a new life together.
Hey, man.
Hey!
Sam.
I didn't hear you coming in.
You scared me to death.
I'll walk louder then.
Walk louder!
Walk louder!
Open sesame!
Close sesame!
What is it with you guys?
Fish, he's used to living alone!
Walk louder next time!
What a scary cat.
Bony.
-Why is she crazy for you? -Wait up!
What are you looking at?
-What about you? -What about me?
I'm her man, while you're only her friend.
But I knew her first.
What are you doing?
Relieving myself.
What?
It's not easy being a man.
How are you guys doing?
"We have troubles with the new place."
What are you saying?
You're living in a big house like this, yet you are complaining.
"We're not complaining."
"We're just not used to it."
"I miss the noise of the airplane."
Hey.
Take Sam's snoring for a change.
All right?
"I miss the hawkers down the alley."
Hey, that's just silly.
"Don't tell me that you don't miss them."
Well, I do.
However, this is the happiest moment of my life.
Even though it's too big and neat here,
and I have to walk around loudly,
as long as Sam is here, I have no complaints.
I really love Sam.
I'm the luckiest girl.
"Aren't you ashamed of yourself?"
Not really.
"Do you want to throw up?"
Not really.
Did I wake you?
What are you doing up?
You'll lose your mind if you keep talking to them.
Talk to me instead.
-Really? -Yes.
Will you be free tomorrow?
I probably will.
We'll talk tomorrow, let's sleep.
Okay.
I was thinking of refurbishing the house.
This is your place too.
Do whatever you want.
You don't have to ask me.
What?
What is this?
Move it. Can't you see that we're working?
Move it.
Fish, what is this mess?
We're refurbishing.
-Refurbishing? -No.
-It's a major overhaul. -When did I decide on that?
-Where should we put the books? -Right here.
What book?
This is a big house.
It's different from the ordinary refurbishing.
-Hey! -That won't do!
-Good morning, you're up early. -Hey.
Do whatever you want, but don't touch my study.
Didn't you say that this is my place too?
From now on, whatever you do, you have to ask me first.
A jacuzzi tub for lovers!
Yes!
Right here!
That's awesome.
In there!
THE STORY OF THE ROSE
I read your book twice. It's a page-turner.
Thank you, Rose.
Can I have your autograph?
-Thank you. -Thank you.
Rose.
Rose!
Wing!
-I love reunions! -I'm so happy.
Hey!
-Who is he? -Hey.
He's Fish.
How's Sam?
Great.
Only you have a spell over him.
Didn't you put out a record?
Why didn't you continue?
I used to be a "Man".
Look at me now.
Do I look like a female singer?
Fix that.
It's very easy.
You have to be kidding me!
I have a back problem.
I can't have two water balloons up my chest while singing and dancing.
You're full of crap.
Thank you.
I'm really busy these days.
How busy?
I have to cook, wash and iron the clothes, feed the dogs...
What can you say about that?
-I guess you are busy. -Yes.
But that doesn't sound like Sam's type at all.
-Hey! -Fish.
Well, it will work out.
The important thing is that everyone is happy, right?
I'm happy.
I believe Sam is happy too.
Sam!
Hey!
Sam, what's wrong?
-What's the matter with you? -I want you!
-Stop! -I want you!
Stop it! Hey!
What's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?
You like girls like this. It's all in the book.
What book?
The story of Rose.
What? She writes?
She can't even spell.
-She... -What rights does she have?
The first half is before she met you,
-while the second half is after that. -Hey!
Then...
Wait!
Where are you going? It's a real tear-jerker!
I'm calling my lawyer and I'll put an injunction to the book.
Is she out of her mind?
-You don't have to. -Why?
It's a sold-out, all 400,000 copies.
Shit.
You just swore.
-What? -Of course, I would swear.
This is totally insane.
There are 400,000 people out there all over my private life.
It's illegal, she needs my permission.
But she wrote great things about you.
Take a look.
You're her hero!
-Really? -Yes.
Wait a second, I can't read this.
Am I crazy?
I don't need to read about myself.
You're right.
-Am I? -Yes.
You shouldn't read it too.
Now that we're living together,
you don't need to read about me from another woman's book.
You should know me well enough.
-I hope so. -You better.
In short, both of us should not read the book.
So do you prefer women with big breasts?
Well, yes.
Then you don't like mine, given how tiny they are.
I didn't say that.
-But you said like big breasts. -Thing is...
Big is...
Big is good, it's dynamic,
but small is okay.
It's cute too.
Do you understand?
It's true that I like big breasts,
but I love you.
That means you love me, but you don't like me.
What?
What date is it?
June 20.
What time is it?
It's 8:20 p.m.
-Is it 8:20 p.m.? -Yes.
-My darling. -Yes?
It has only been ten days
and it's such a short time.
We should give ourselves more time
to decide if our relationship will work.
What if it doesn't work?
Then we'll make it work.
-I promise. -Really?
Okay.
-I trust you. -Just trust me.
Don't mess with me.
Let me take a closer look.
They're stuffed.
But they look real.
They're...
You know.
-Do you like them? -Of course.
They look great.
That's enough, you can go.
I can't sing in the morning, but I sing better at night.
Turn around.
You may go.
What are you doing?
Are you making a pass at me?
You are a creep!
A straight pretending to be gay!
What are you thinking?
No, Auntie. I...
I am...
I'm really gay.
Get out.
Yes, Auntie.
A singer? With that voice?
I can't believe it.
What a screwed up world.
Emma, the guy who just left,
call him for a second audition.
-Hey. -What?
What are you doing?
It's nothing, he's actually okay.
I know that he doesn't have a great voice,
But he is cute.
Our options are limited.
We need someone who can sing.
You know.
Not every record can be a hit.
What's wrong? Not again!
I think I'm in trouble again.
Ever since she moved in, she has turned my life upside down.
I can't even compose these days.
I really can't live with another person.
It's tough living with someone.
If it's tough on you, I bet it's tougher on her.
-Hey. -What?
Can I perhaps move back into Rose's apartment downstairs?
No problem, but in three years' time.
I just rented it under a three-year contract.
The tenant is a foreigner.
-Are you serious? -Hey.
But you told me to.
It's tough working for you.
You better get yourself another Auntie.
Sam, stop being a child.
You were the one who asked her to move in, yet now you're trying to move out.
I'm not moving out, it's only downstairs.
Just like the old days when I was with Rose.
More space for both of us.
Who knows, I'll even come to love her more.
I get it.
First, you find a woman and marry her.
Then you divorce her the next day, only to continue dating her.
Basically, you're doing all this just to love her more.
Do you think it will work?
Theoretically, it works.
But practically, it doesn't.
You can solve this problem of yours
by keeping her busy.
Okay?
Think about it.
Keep her busy?
I haven't disappeared.
I was studying music at Juilliard,
all the while saving Michael Jackson's marriage.
Then I went to visit Madonna, dropped by London,
and I even wrote
a song for the Cocteau Twins.
In fact, I had a cameo on George Michaels' MTV,
but now I'm here to stay.
Darn it, did I miss anything?
Great, my boy!
Great, my boy! Are you serious? Nobody will believe all those crap.
Are you serious? Nobody will believe all those crap.
If they believe that she's a man,
then they'll believe anything!
She'll be the toast of the town.
You're full of baloney!
Please look here!
IN LOVE WITH THE LEGEND
Today, we are really honored
to have the hottest singer, Wing, for our interview.
Please feel free to ask him any questions!
Few have claimed that Wing is Fan Fan's counterpart.
Do you agree with this?
You're great.
Do you really think that he's handsome?
Thank you.
Fan Fan's phenomenon has brought androgyny to Hong Kong's pop culture.
She was the biggest and brightest star,
who dresses like a man.
How do you see yourself, Wing?
How can I compare myself to my number one idol?
Ever since I was a kid, I have been her biggest fan.
I have collected all of her records and news clippings.
Hong Kong.
Come here, very good.
Look this way.
WEEKLY MAGAZINE
I want to thank the security guard downstairs,
the old lady who sells newspapers,
-and... -What about me?
Don't leave out my name!
Or else I'll quit.
I want to thank Fish
-and there's... -Hey, what is this?
-Did you tell others about our hot-tub? -There's also...
Be quiet.
Not to forget my goldfish and my buddy, Bo Bo.
Who else do I have to thank?
You don't have to thank every Tom, Dick, and Harry.
It's important to be direct on stage, so don't look around.
You just have to thank the audience.
Don't call me honey in front of everyone.
Wing is downstairs, quickly get ready!
Did you hear what I just said?
Wing is already downstairs!
Excuse me.
Wing is here!
-Wing is here! -Can you hear me?
Wing is here!
-Please move, Wing is here! -I heard that.
Wing is here!
-Wing! -Wing!
-Wing! -Wing!
-Wing! -Wing!
-Thank you. -I like you too.
Am I pretty?
Wing, it's your money.
Your big mansion and fancy cars.
I really pity your parents.
You're too fat to be a fan.
You look just like a pig.
-You look like you’re crazy. -I’m your biggest fan!
No way!
-Wing, I've waited a long time for you! -Hey, get out!
Get out!
-Your fans are crazy. -Look at this!
This is very expensive!
-Wing! -Wing!
-Wing! -Wing!
-Wing! -Wing!
Wing!
-You have to be good to Wing! -Hey!
-If not, I'll kill you! -Hey, let go!
Has Wing bought you a house?
Several critics said that you're "The new comrade of the era".
It seems that your new piece, "Gay Man Forties" will be out?
Several claimed that Wing gave you a hefty 30 million cash, is that true?
-Wing! -Wing!
That's Wing!
-I wish to go to your concert. -Really?
-May I have a ticket? -Sure.
-Your tickets are hard to get! -I love you!
-Wing! -This is for you!
-The show is starting, please go back. -Wing!
-Get back to your seats! -Wing!
-Emil Chow! -Go back.
I love listening to you sing!
Your songs are wonderful!
-I'm serious! -Thank you.
Don't mention it.
Can I have your signature?
Please write down, "To Wing".
My name is Wing, please don't forget me.
Of course, I won't. I've listened to your last release.
-You know who I am! -That's right.
-Of course, I do. -Thank you!
Sam loves your songs.
-Yes, Sam and I are friends. -Really?
Where is he?
Sam?
Sam!
Sam!
Sam!
Hi, Emil.
Sam is so far away.
-Sam, let's change seats. -What?
There's no need.
Come on, let's change.
There's really no need, thank you.
Thank you so much!
-Don't worry about it. -You are a star,
-Come here, have this seat. -yet you're so nice.
All right.
-Sam. -What?
My idol Fan Fan is coming tonight.
I know.
Ladies and Gentlemen, in every generation,
there is a phenomenal star.
The winner of the Lifetime Achievement Award tonight
is the star of all stars.
That's right, it's Miss Fan Fan.
Fan Fan stepped into the music industry at age 5.
At 6, she recorded her first single album.
In the following 15 years,
she has released a total of 28 albums.
That's right, at the height of her career,
she has decided to retire from the limelight.
She had entirely vanished from the entertainment industry.
From then on, nobody knew her whereabouts.
She was spotted every now and then.
She was once seen in Rio, dancing the Samba with four pineapples.
In 1989, she was spotted windsurfing near an island in the South Pacific.
In 1992, however, she helped war orphans,
by feeding them in the midst of a war zone in Mozambique.
So where exactly is she?
No one knows.
Don't worry, she is here tonight.
That's right, it's the legend of all legends.
We present to you, Miss Fan Fan!
Yes, let's welcome
a brand new image,
a never seen before Fan Fan...
New...
Hey!
What's your name?
It's none of your business, asshole.
My name is Fish, nice to meet you!
What's your name?
O!
What?
O!
O.
Last but not least,
for the category of Best Male Vocal Artist year 1996,
the winner is...
Wing!
Thank you!
Congratulations.
-Go and take your award. -The award.
Sam, let's go together.
Go.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a lot of people to thank,
but my producer asked me to make it short and quick.
So I'll just thank one person.
It's you.
You don't have to look around.
Thank you.
One, two, three!
-Wing! -Wing!
-Wing! -Back off!
-Wing! -You forgot me!
-Wing! -Wing!
Wing! Don't forget me!
Someone touched me!
-Wing! -Wing!
You're crazy, you animals.
Start driving!
-Where's Sam? Slow down! -Wait!
Hey, where's Sam?
-Forget him, he'll manage. -Sam!
Keep driving, let him take the cab.
-Wing! -Wing!
Hey!
Wait for me!
-It's Sam! -Sam!
O!
O!
Fan Fan, I'm here!
-I won't pick up awards for you anymore. -How was it?
There wasn't even a single baby backstage.
Hey, who's living upstairs?
He's noisy.
Nobody that I know of.
-It sounds like a bunch of creeps. -How would you know?
But it seems like
the creeps are having a party upstairs.
A party?
This is my house, what's the matter with you?
Make up your mind.
Do not regret this, I'm going to show you some muscles.
Don't...
What is it?
Fish, where's Wing?
Hey, Mr.
I'm not Fish, I'm...
Okay, where the hell is Wing?
I have been looking all over for her.
I saw her running around in a zebra suit a while ago,
but God knows where she is right now.
Okay, carry on.
Auntie!
You can recognize me in this?
Of course, who can miss that fat butt of yours?
Have you seen Sam?
Goodness, I throw this party so that you can meet more people.
Not to be stuck with Sam 24 hours a day, do you get it?
Go make some new friends. Just go!
Look at those lips!
What a man! I'm coming!
With all these masks, I can't even tell a man from a woman.
I don't want to hit on the wrong person.
You've never been with a man, yet you insist on liking women.
How can you be so sure?
You've never been with a woman, yet you insist on liking men.
Sam!
Wing!
Wing!
Sam!
What is so funny?
You've turned the house into a mess.
I thought you wanted me to meet more people.
I told you to meet more people,
not to bring them home.
-Then I'll just ask them to leave. -Wait.
-Just don't do it again. -I'll go get you a drink.
I thought Sam Koo hate parties.
He's not the boss around here,
Wing is the one paying all the bills.
He hasn't written a song for six months.
Sam would be down and out by now,
if not for Wing.
What did you say?
Who is the boss?
What do you know about composing songs?
I'll play with you.
I have had enough of this.
I'm going to Africa, so are you coming?
But I just came back from Africa last week.
Sorry, I took you for someone else.
What else do you want to listen to?
-Africa, tell me about Africa. -Africa?
Close your eyes and let your imagination run.
Imagine a whole bunch of women,
all naked, running wild.
It was crazy.
Then there's a group of men,
fighting the lions by ripping off their skin.
There was blood everywhere.
All on the ground.
The women even slept next to that.
-Do you want to know? -What?
There were giraffes too.
Suddenly, they were behind you.
Also,
Paul Simon's music.
"Under the African Sky"!
-Yes! -Yes!
Sam!
-Sam! -Fan Fan!
I have gotten a girl, so don't wait for me.
Who was waiting for you?
This is a crazy party!
Sam!
How exciting. Where are we going?
Mission Impossible?
Hey.
This is a strange place.
It even has a basement.
Is this a dungeon or something?
I have brought wine, Sam!
Sam!
Dim sum.
-Sweet and sour pork. -Yes.
Roast pigeon.
Fried clams at Aberdeen.
Delicious!
And Sam Koo's "Chase".
Don't you know who Sam Koo is?
Hey.
He is Hong Kong's number one composer.
He writes the greatest songs,
but he's gay.
What? Isn't he gay?
He's not gay.
Yes, he is.
Say that again and I'll...
He's gay.
I'll prove that he's not gay!
I miss you, Sam.
Why would you do that?
Just let her call you gay.
It won't hurt.
It's the alcohol.
I'm back.
Sam!
Do you have a party hangover?
That's right.
Did you get these for me? They're beautiful!
Move it, you're in my way!
Sam.
Look who's here.
Hey, I'm right behind you!
Hey!
Sam!
Don't move.
Fan Fan can tell your fortune by feeling your body.
-What are you saying? -How is his career?
-I hate this. -It's good.
-How about family? -Good.
Then it's fine, what else do you want to know?
There's one more thing, love.
It seems like...
What is it?
Good.
How about his health?
Hold up!
Can you tell if he's healthy only from that?
-Let me... -Hey, stop touching!
-I want to touch it too. -Stop that.
Hey!
Let's see how many kids he'll have.
-That's enough. -Sam.
What were you dressed as at the party?
-He was a... -Hey!
A geoduck.
Fan Fan.
Can you really tell if a guy will have kids by touching him there?
Geoduck.
Whatever it is, deny it.
I'm right behind you.
When I'm being quiet, I scare you.
When I make a noise, I still scare you.
Are you a man?
Crazy.
Every time I see something good, I get goosebumps.
Feel it.
Hey, are you taking advantage of me?
I have a black belt in karate.
You grabbed my hand first.
Do you have wet dreams sometimes?
Of course.
I have them all the time.
Guess the girl who was in my wet dream last night.
-Christie Chung. -Come on!
I had her in my dreams last week.
Her butt is really cute.
Wait, but Chung is a woman.
So?
Of course, I like her smooth butt better.
I wouldn't like a hairy one like yours.
-I don't like it. -A hairy butt has its good points too.
Are you already asleep?
Not yet.
I snore to put myself to sleep.
Do you want to talk? I'll chat with you.
Aren't you tired?
Shouldn't you be the one who is tired?
You were on the phone the whole day.
A little bit.
Do you want to know what we talked about?
No.
But you can tell me if you want.
No, don't tell me.
You should have your own secrets.
That's right, I'm an adult now.
You know, I get along with Fan Fan very well.
She has been to a lot of places, so she knows a lot.
Do you know that she has been to Africa?
We can talk for weeks.
Of course, she's so old, yet rich and free.
She can go anywhere.
You're old too, but you've never been to Africa.
I have to make money to put food on the table.
There's no need, Auntie said my records are selling well.
I'm making enough for both of us.
Anyway, you don't have any inspirations lately,
so don't compose.
Let's go to Africa, I'll pay for everything.
I'm going to bed.
Hey.
What?
Hey.
Didn't you say that you want to go to Africa?
Enough with that.
You better move elsewhere.
But it doesn't seem like she's selling me out.
If she wants to, Wing would have known about it by now.
There are only two types of women.
One, those who treat you as disposable underwear.
Only after one use, it goes into the trash.
Me? No way.
If not, then she still has feelings for you.
She doesn't want it to be over soon.
Hey.
You're kidding, it can't be.
You're such a chicken.
You should go down and talk to her.
Go down? That's dangerous.
Are you scared?
Are you scared that if you see her again, you won't be able to control yourself?
You're crazy.
Tell me the truth.
Were there fireworks that night?
You're bad.
Honestly, it was an amazing night.
I wonder how she feels.
You lied to me!
-You have something going on with her! -Wait up.
Do you think I won't know if you don't say anything?
Do you think I won't know if you don't say anything? -I am suffering! -Who told you?
-Listen! -I don't want to!
Mr. Lam, I think green is better for the study.
This one, it's brighter.
Lovely.
-Hey, let me explain. -No!
You don't have to explain! You've been lying to me!
-How much have I done for you? -Do you want the ceilings painted?
There's no need to paint them, just do the walls.
Tell me what I should do! What have I done wrong?
Tell me, what can I do?
Calm down!
-What game are you playing? -How did you know that I am?
I have accepted a role in a movie.
-Cut! -Fish.
Can you do it again from the beginning to the end?
You always stop in the middle.
How can you get an Oscar? How can you be compared to Sharon Stone?
I was going to insist, but I...
I have to find my mark and also to be in the mood.
Did you record it?
What do you mean by recording? I have to practice too.
I'm not professional.
I don't even know which button to press.
How about this?
What is this button for?
This, I don't know this word.
Ask Sam.
Read the manual.
Go read the manual.
That's strange, your reaction was good.
Did you know that I was rehearsing?
Tell me what I don't know.
Hey, a movie? What movie it is?
I've accepted a crossdressing role, as the leading actress.
You sure have guts.
What if they know that you're a girl...
They won't! How would they know?
I'm meeting someone, let's talk later.
-Hey! -Hey.
I've read the entire manual, but I still can't find the button.
You're a pain.
Do you know German?
No.
French?
English?
I've only learned the letter "S".
Okay.
Then even I can't help you.
Hey!
Who is she meeting?
Do you know Joan?
How about Linda?
Okay.
I can't help you.
Joan?
You are really "S" today.
What is "S"?
You sure know how to sweet-talk.
Of course, now where do you intend to take me today?
I hate to make plans.
That makes life more interesting.
Whatever will be will be.
-Fan Fan. -Yes?
I have something to tell you.
Just say it.
I have something to discuss with you.
-Listen to me first. -I am listening.
Don't fool around, all right?
Fan Fan.
This is the stage.
I was five when I sang and danced on that stage.
Then there he was, waving me over.
"You'll be a star," he said.
He's right.
Fan Fan, who was the one waving at you?
It was Bruce Lee.
You've seen Bruce Lee?
You better not be pulling my legs.
I have something to tell you, Fan Fan.
Fan Fan?
Yes, I would not be here today if not for her.
Who are you talking about?
Fong Fong.
Fong Fong?
Yes, she taught me a lot.
Then she helped me change my name to Fan Fan.
Fan and Fong,
they sound good together.
What's your real name?
Nothing's changed, you just have to spell it backward.
Naf Naf!
It sounds good!
-Do you think so too? -Yes!
-The fortune-teller said the same thing. -Really?
He said if I were to use my real name, I would be famous.
However, my love life is not that good.
-What about Fan Fan? -Even worse.
Is Wing your real name?
Of course, Wing is not my real name.
My real name sounds masculine.
What's your name?
Lam Chi-cheung!
Then what?
You don't know how to sing, yet you pretend to be a singer.
That's what Sam says about me.
I would like to discuss something with you.
If not for Bruce, I would just be an ordinary person.
Then I'll be much happier.
But you're doing well now. You're famous and wealthy.
However, you have something that I don't.
What is it?
A normal childhood.
Everyone has that.
When you were skipping rope, I was learning how to dance.
When you were studying, I was backstage learning lines.
When everyone is talking about their first love,
I have already played the bride 18 times in the movies,
singing scores of love songs.
If I could have my innocence and first love,
that would be great.
Why can't you?
It's because I am now Fan Fan.
I'm no longer Naf Naf.
I still think of myself as Lam Chi-cheung in the skid road.
How about this?
I let you choose.
What kind of first love would you like?
Like a rabbit.
Kind.
Simple.
Innocent.
There is someone.
Really?
Who's your first love?
Sam.
But he's not like a little rabbit.
Don't talk about him, Fan Fan.
Actually, I have something to discuss with you.
I want you to pretend to be my girlfriend.
Sam doesn't like people thinking that he's gay.
If I have a girlfriend, no one would say that he's gay anymore.
Why are you so good to Sam?
It's because he's good to me.
Really?
Sam, open the door!
Sam, open the door!
Mr. Koo, open up!
You're already in, don't wake the neighbors up.
I like to wake you up, it makes me happy.
It makes me so happy.
-It so late and you didn't call. -So happy.
You told me that I don't have to call you.
You said that I'm not a kid and I have my space.
-You have yours. -What are you doing?
-Sit down! -Let go.
-You're as drunk as a skunk. -No, I'm not.
Why should I listen to you?
No.
It's a chimney! Is there anyone there?
-Go to sleep. -Let go, I don't want to.
You can go to sleep, but I don't want to.
I want an apple. Do you want some?
It's very crispy.
Who were you with?
Why do I have to tell you?
Bitch.
Are you calling me a bitch?
Yes, I was with Fan Fan.
Bitch.
That's right,
Fan Fan even said that my song, "Chase" is very good.
Do you have no shame?
I composed that song for you.
You're crazy!
If I didn't start it, you would have not composed it.
In fact,
Fan Fan also said that she has never seen anyone
with a star quality like me.
-Are you okay? -What do you think?
All right!
What's the matter?
The toilet is this way.
You're so drunk that I feel like hitting you.
-Sam. -What?
Why did you hit me?
I had a dream that you hit me and you even told me to go to hell.
It was only a dream.
Go back to sleep.
If it's just a dream, then why does my back hurt?
I'll massage it a little, then it would no longer hurt.
-Do you feel better now? -Yes.
Go to sleep, be good.
Sleep.
-Sam! -Yes?
Do you remember me asking you?
-Who should die between the two of us? -Yes?
How come you never asked me?
Ask me now.
Do you want to die or do you want me to die?
I'll choose to die.
Okay, then you should die.
Are you not happy?
I've decided to die for you.
I am.
I'm happy, okay?
Go to sleep, it's late. Be good.
Don't cry.
I know that for a 20-year relationship...
It's not fair, but...
But I have met a girl I like.
I shouldn't give up.
You should think about me, do you understand?
It's not me who don't like you, it's...
It's her who hates you.
You're only going away for one or two months.
I will still love you and I won't leave you.
Okay?
Then it's decided.
I'll give you some shaving cream.
It will be in one stroke.
Just like an injection, there won't be any pain.
It will be very quick.
FAN AND WING GOT TOGETHER KOO IS DUMPED
Wing!
Wing!
What?
Look at this.
They have fallen into my trap.
Did you tell them to write this?
Yes.
Don't you know that I begged Fan Fan to pretend to be my girlfriend?
Now no one would say that you're gay.
This is not okay.
-Why not? -If you're the one who wrote this,
then doesn't it mean that you're dumping me?
That's not the truth, how is that possible?
You know that I love you, right?
Readers don't know what's real.
They believe what they read.
If you keep doing this,
Fan Fan would eventually find out that you're a woman.
I can always deny it.
-Deny it? -Yes.
Even if she takes off all of my clothes, I can still deny it.
-You can still deny? -Yes, you were the one who taught me.
We're just making friends.
I'll keep my distance.
Don't worry, I'm smart.
I'm going to work, you should stay at home and compose.
If you're bored, go for a shopping with Auntie or see a movie.
I'll come back right after work, okay?
Hey.
Your glasses.
I forgot, I'm not coming back tonight.
You're not coming back?
Then where are you going?
I'm going to Fan Fan's. I want to read the script with her.
-I'll be on early shift tomorrow morning. -Come here.
I don't want to wake you up.
Fan Fan said that she might move.
If she moves, why don't I move downstairs?
Then we would have our own space, right?
-Let me... -I don't have the time to talk.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing?
-Good morning. -Good morning.
How are you?
Why are you so upset this morning?
Good morning.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
Look, how nice!
Turn around.
-Come here, take the seat. -Okay.
I'll help you.
Stand up, be careful!
-It's okay. -Do you really think she's teaching you?
-She's just coming onto you. -Don't listen to him.
If your parents know that you're with a lesbian,
your parents will be upset, so will your grandparents.
Your friends will look down on you, so will your relatives and the society.
Think about it, you can't even have children!
Save it, she has left.
You won't even get a seat in the subway.
That's enough!
Why don't you start liking guys?
You look pretty dressed as a girl.
Really?
Nobody ever said that to me.
It's too bad that Sam is not here.
Remember to tell him next time.
It's Sam again.
Between Sam and I,
who do you think is more handsome?
Let me see.
You're more handsome.
You have style,
but Sam is manly.
You always compare me to a man.
I can't win.
You lack one thing.
What is it?
A glowing rod?
Yes, it's useful.
Put it at the right place and you will become powerful.
Will it glow in the dark?
Of course not.
You won't be a man just because you have a man's haircut,
or you wear men's clothing, even some fake mustaches.
-Then how? -You have to feel the ultimate manhood.
With it,
regardless of whether you're sitting or standing.
You'll even think like a man.
Really?
Of course.
I'll help you, come here.
You can't do it yourself.
All right.
Hey.
Aren't you helping me?
I'll ask someone else to do it for you.
Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean.
Atlantic City.
Atlantic City.
What?
O!
What?
I heard from Fish that you're crooked.
What? I'm not.
No.
-Don't you like women? -Yes!
-I have a question for you. -Yes?
I have a friend.
Her boyfriend and her are good together,
but recently, she has been thinking
-about another woman. -Hey!
Does she know how to rollerblade? Is she pretty?
She's not bad.
Forget it.
Hey, I'm not done.
O!
-O! -Yes?
I want to know what it's like to like a girl.
First, they would cut their hair short.
Then they would wear men's clothes,
pretending to be a man.
After that,
hiccups would follow suit.
Yes, just like that.
I don't have it.
Lastly,
when your eyes are closed,
you can only see pretty girls.
Feel it.
It's not as hairy.
Is it smooth enough?
Close your eyes and try to imagine.
Close your eyes.
Does it feel like a woman's?
A woman.
No way!
This side hasn't been shaved, it'll be better once it is shaved!
Wait, it will feel like a woman's leg!
No.
Let me shave the other leg!
No, I can see your face and smell your manly body odor.
Fish.
I don't think you can force your feelings on her.
What do you know?
I shaved my leg for her!
Would you shave for Wing?
So noisy.
Please let me through.
Mr. Koo, please wait.
Wait, Mr. Koo. We'll all go down.
Yes, come back soon.
Mr. Koo!
I'm sorry.
Don't worry.
-Actually the party that night... -I...
That was an exception.
An exception.
Of course.
It was an exception for me too.
Right, of course.
It's a secret.
A secret.
Come up for a drink whenever you have the time.
Okay, but I won't wear a mask.
Of course.
Geoduck.
FAN FAN, SAM
I want to see Sam!
It's Fan Fan again.
Damn it.
She didn't wear any clothes this time.
Sam! This time I want to see Sam!
Sam!
Sam.
It's still Fan Fan.
No.
Even this ugly woman makes me hiccup.
No way.
I'll never be straight again.
Why does this elevator take so long?
Did you press the button?
Did you not?
No, I didn't.
What's that?
We are stuck!
Hey!
What's wrong?
-I'm scared! -Don't be scared!
-I'm scared as well! -It's scary!
Don't be scared!
Why do you have a glowing rod?
It's a given.
I have been trapped in this elevator over 30 times,
so I'm well-prepared.
This will only last for half an hour.
Feel this pocket. Can you feel that?
What did you put inside there?
I was trapped here once for five hours.
That's why there are nine of them, so don't worry.
She sells seashells by the seashore!
What's wrong?
That's so weird.
Really?
Well, Wing taught me.
-No one dances like this anymore. -Really?
Of course.
Currently, it's this dance.
She sells seashells by the seashore!
Amazing, how exciting.
Hey, teach me.
Teach me.
-I'll get it if you teach me three times. -Really?
Come.
One, two, three.
-She sells seashells by the seashore! -She sells seashells by the seashore!
Geoduck!
This is very comfortable.
Don't move even if it's comfortable.
I've always been the one to massage Sam.
But being massaged instead is so comfortable.
If you like it, then come down more often.
Why are you so good to me?
It's because you're good to me.
We can still be friends without love.
Fan Fan, you're so understanding.
Perhaps is it easier to talk to women?
I find talking to you to be more comfortable than with Sam.
Men and women are different.
What's the difference?
When men like someone,
they would make themselves happy.
When women like someone,
they would make their partner happy.
Naturally, they too would feel happy.
That's true.
I always want to do things that would make Sam happy.
If he's happy, then I am too.
That's why I believe that you're not a man.
Am I not like a man?
I'm saying that you don't have their faults.
No.
As of lately,
I can feel that Sam is not that happy.
We weren't like this before.
We used to be very happy.
Is it because I moved in with him?
But he asked me to move in with him.
Maybe it's because I have two left feet.
Sam never lived with anyone before.
He had never lived with anyone.
He sacrificed a lot for me.
He said I was bored at home,
so I started singing again.
Once again, I have my own career.
So I entered the entertainment industry and became an instant hit.
After a few awards,
Sam suddenly told me...
He told me not to sing anymore.
He said my job is too tough and gives me great pressure!
He worries that others think he's gay.
It's okay, since I don't really like singing.
So I said to him,
"Let's go to Africa."
That was his dream and he's been wanting to go there.
But suddenly, he told me
to never to mention Africa again!
Never again!
I don't know what's on his mind.
At times he would say "yes", then he would say "no".
He would say "go", only to say "don't go" later.
I really don't know what to do.
But I feel very lucky.
Really.
Sorry, I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm really happy.
Believe me.
He has been good to me.
I'm only crying because I'm happy.
It's not that I'm unhappy.
Do you understand?
Do you think he's good to me?
Thank you.
Fan Fan.
What?
Why are you crying?
I'm not crying.
I'm laughing.
Do you know how happy I am?
There is still a little rabbit in the world.
If only I could have one just like you,
that would be great.
It would be perfect if you and Sam
are one person.
If only you were not gay.
When I was trapped in the elevator with you,
I was suddenly inspired and wrote a song.
-Really? -Really.
I'll go in and play it for you.
I'm in my nightgown, so it's not convenient.
How about next time?
-Okay. -Thank you.
Good night.
It feels good.
It feels so good.
Fan Fan.
I want you to kiss me.
Kiss me.
Kiss.
A kiss.
Kiss me.
Fan Fan.
Kiss me.
I'm a little rabbit,
so please kiss me.
Fan Fan.
A kiss.
A kiss.
Fan Fan.
-Fan Fan. -"Fan Fan"?
A kiss.
"A kiss"?
Hey.
It's fresh.
Don't act like this.
Why can't we be friends?
No, how can men and women be friends?
You can treat me as a man.
Don't force me.
You force me to be your friend, but I can't force you to make love.
Where is the reasoning?
Do you want it or not?
Forget it.
Don't force yourself.
Just once, only one time.
I've said it before...
-You don't even listen to me. -A half time.
How can there be a half time?
Let's just sleep through the night.
-What does that mean? -We will only sleep.
Why not? What else can I do?
You guys seem to like dancing.
Mr. Koo, give us some pointers.
-It's not bad. -Thank you.
Mr. Koo!
I picked up a piece of paper.
Is it your poker record?
We don't gamble at home.
It has "Fan" and "Sam" written on it.
Thank you.
You were supposed to say, "Everybody hit the beat out".
Why are you yelling at me?
Don't get upset.
Hey.
Fish, where's Wing?
I don't know, don't ask me.
I know, Wing and Fan have gone shooting.
They have to kiss.
Hey.
What does this paper mean?
I taught this to Wing.
To close his eyes and write down who is he thinking about.
You only have a few strokes.
Serve you right.
What? Did I scare you?
No.
How would you describe me today?
Very...
What's with that?
My mind is blank that I can't think of anything.
I know.
Are you nervous?
Very.
Here.
-Which flavor do you like? -Condoms?
Chewing gum.
I hope when we're doing the kissing scene later,
I'll taste better for you.
You're late, Mr. Koo.
I have to go to the toilet, you two should talk for a while.
Wing!
Hey.
I have to talk to you.
All right.
You've become close to Wing recently, did you notice anything strange?
Anything strange?
No.
He's nice to you.
It doesn't look like a normal friendship.
-I know. -It's not...
I know what you mean.
I was going to tell you after the film wraps.
I think Wing is happier with me.
Wing is happier with you?
Then...
He and you...
Me and you...
What is it?
What's the matter?
Calm down.
Give Wing a chance, you can be with a woman again.
Of course, I can! I...
Anyway, both of you can't be together.
Mr. Koo.
Nothing is impossible.
Face the reality.
Face the reality?
Good, you should face the reality.
He's not my boyfriend.
She's my girlfriend.
She's my girlfriend.
You have to find that feeling, can you do that?
Help me find that feeling.
It's a contradicting emotion.
Fan Fan.
Yes, that's the right emotion.
Give me more feelings, all right?
I know.
Break a leg.
Good, let's get ready.
Shot 13, take 1.
Scarlet.
Rhett.
Scarlet.
Rhett.
It doesn't matter if the world changes,
even if we only have our sweet memories.
We won't have any regrets.
Don't worry, just a little bit more. Let's do it again.
Take two.
Take 8. Take 12.
Director, let's take a break for lunch.
Another break?
Okay.
Let's eat!
-Okay! -All right!
Fan Fan, I'm sorry.
Am I being too nervous?
I want to ask you something.
If I were a man,
would you still choose me over Sam?
Forget it.
I just want to tell you.
That it was real.
Director!
Let's do it!
Take 13.
Scarlet.
Rhett.
It doesn't matter if the world changes,
whether you're a man or a woman...
even if we only have our sweet memories.
We won't have any regrets.
Who is it?
Move!
Auntie.
Hey!
I'm not answering your question,
just like how you ignored Wing when she had problems.
You don't make sense.
She needs help right now,
yet you walked out on her?
The problem is
she is now in love with a woman.
Then tell her what to do.
I don't know what to do.
That excuse doesn't justify you walking out on her.
Shit hits the fan, then you leave.
You're such a coward.
It's just the two of us, there's no need for a swimming suit.
Hey.
Look at me.
Is that you?
Christie?
Christie.
Not only is your ass fine.
It's you who seduce me.
I'm only taking your cue.
That hurts!
Please be gentle.
You said that you'll never leave me.
You said that you'll love me forever.
You said that you would rather die.
They were all lies.
"But you're in love with Fan Fan."
I wasn't!
"You liar."
She's good to me.
"Sam is good to you too."
If he really is good to me,
he wouldn't have left.
One last scene before the show is over.
Faster!
You pervert!
You pervert.
What is "concentrate"?
Help!
I have decided that I only like women.
What's with that? I just...
How could you say such a thing?
No, silly.
We were great!
I give us a B+.
B+?
I had never gotten a B+ at school.
That's right, but I think of you as a woman.
I don't need a sex-change, right?
No, silly!
Even if you become a woman, I won't be stuck with you.
There are plenty of other beautiful women.
Can you be loyal to only one woman?
No, I can't.
It's a given. Some people can, while others can't.
It's a no for both of us.
But if I think that it's possible one day,
I'll come back for you.
When?
When we're older.
When we're older.
Yes, when we're older.
Whatever.
How did I get a B+?
How did you come up with a B+?
A B+ means
that it was almost perfect.
Of course, you want to do better.
Like a "Chi".
Get a "Chu"...
It's a feel.
It's a feel.
Yes.
How to spell "feel"?
You don't have the hiccups.
What are you thinking about?
I...
What are you thinking about?
I'm thinking...
Hey.
Hey, what's wrong?
Don't cry.
It's as if I forced myself on you.
It was my first time too.
-Just now, you didn't say no. -That's not it!
I'm just thinking that...
What is today's date?
October 1st.
It has only been four months!
Yet I'm already a mess.
Four months ago, I wore a white skirt
and ran away from downtown to here.
I thought I would be with Sam forever.
But I can't believe
that I had fallen in love with you!
I understand.
You don't understand.
I know what you're thinking about.
Do you?
I don't even know myself.
Give me your hand.
Let me tell you this.
-Say it after me. -All right.
I,
"I,"
Lam Chi-wing,
"Lam Chi-wing,"
wish...
"wish..."
that it never happened
and I'll live happily ever after with Sam.
Remember this.
This is it from now on.
Fan Fan.
How about we go out dancing?
Let's put our clothes back on.
Thank you.
This is mine.
-How ugly. -There's one.
It's so big. Whose is it?
It's mine.
Is it yours? So big.
When I pretended to be a woman...
"Pretended to be a woman"? Aren't you actually one?
-It's not that big. -Let me see!
-Let me see. -Wing!
Wing!
It's Sam!
Sam!
Why would you hide when it's your home?
It should be me.
-Wing, where are you? -Handle it for me.
-Just pretend that it's your home. -Hey!
Wing.
Don't be mad at me.
I know I shouldn't have left like that.
I would never do it again, okay?
Also,
you and I are meant to last forever.
Even when you turn old.
Even if you suffer from Parkinson's or cancer,
I'll still be with you.
Why are you here?
I dozed off.
-Why didn't you doze off at your place? -I was nearby!
Where's Wing?
-She left. -Where did she go?
You should go out first, then I'll tell you.
Go out?
It's my room.
-Don't think that night-- -Nothing happened!
We slept together for one night, yet you said nothing happened?
Let me tell you...
You and my girl...
You two are bastards!
I hate both of you!
-Wing... -Let me explain.
Leave me alone!
Say whatever you like.
Wing.
I don't want to hear any of it!
As a matter of fact,
what were you two doing?
Hey!
Take it easy.
Treat each incident separately.
Solve her problem first.
Were you messing with my woman?
Shut up!
What are you saying?
Was I that unreasonable?
-Which page? -What?
Look, there.
That time,
you didn't speak to me for three days.
You were in a bad mood.
But I'm always in a bad mood.
But it's nothing personal.
There were only the two of us in the house.
How should I know it wasn't personal?
We haven't talked like this for a long time.
It's because you never talked to me.
I didn't know how to talk to you, so how could we have talked?
It's strange.
People come to know more about each other after a break-up.
Ka-ming.
Don't be too rigid.
You're giving a hard time to the ones close to you.
Fish, I want to leave alone.
Why?
I want to fly there all by myself.
You haven't taken any plane, aren't you afraid?
Let me pay for my own ticket.
I’m not a kid anymore, I really want to be alone.
But I'm still a kid!
What am I going to do without you?
Don't you trust me?
I can't even trust myself.
It's Fan Fan.
Fan Fan wants to give this to Wing.
Wait up!
What is it?
Don't you have anything to say to me?
No.
How about you?
No.
I guess that's it.
-Bye. -Bye.
I'm sorry.
Aside from the party that night,
I never lied to you.
That day, I held your hand and said,
"I, Lam Chi-wing,
wish that it never happened
and I'll live happily ever after with Sam."
You didn't seem to believe me.
I didn't have the chance to talk to you.
If you really love someone
and you believe that he loves you,
nothing can keep you from mending the broken pieces.
Also, thank you for letting me know
that little rabbit still exists.
Ten years ago, I left Hong Kong
in search of my little rabbit.
Little did I realize,
that I would one day find my innocence
at the place where I first lost it.
If I were to cross paths with you earlier,
I wouldn't have to take all the wrong turns.
-I'll miss it. -What will you miss?
I don't know.
Why do we travel by boat every time when we leave?
You can see the scenery slowly fading out
when you're on a boat.
What kind of scenery?
Wing!
Wing!
SAM, I LOVE YOU
SECOND POINT
OUTSTANDING
LET'S GO TO AFRICA!
SENSE OF SECURITY
BORING
Mr. Koo!
-What is it? -The renovation is completed.
I'll send the money to your office.
It's not a matter of money.
Mandy.
-Say it. -You do it.
Hurry up, I don't have much time.
We always dance in front of you
because we want to be noticed.
-All right, I understand. -Get to the point.
Actually, both you and Mr. Lam have always been our idols.
But our relationship...
However, ever since you both admitted it,
we're filled with courage.
To face this society.
-To come out of the closet. -I understand.
Even if Wing and I did not appear,
you should not worry about how others look at you.
It's because love can't be explained.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
Let's go.
Right, the study room has been fully furnished.
Due to Mr. Lam's request,
you weren't allowed to go in until it's done.
However, you can take a look at it now.
-Okay. -Mandy, let's go.
-Goodbye. -Bye.
Are you leaving?
Wing moved out, so why should I stay?
Hey.
Where did she go?
I won't tell you.
Hey.
Go to the study to find out.
That's it.
Wing?
Hey, it really is you.
What a coincidence.
Isn't it?
Where's Sam?
Should I change seat with him again?
He's not coming.
Don't cry.
I don't know what to do.
Leave me alone.
Can you stop fidgeting?
Economy class?
Why are you going to Africa alone?
Fish said that it's the furthest place from Hong Kong.
You still hate me.
Don't forgive me.
It's such a mess
and it's not only because of you.
I don't even trust myself anymore.
Sir?
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm just comforting my wife.
Wife?
He's a man.
So?
It's fine.
Come on, let's go home.
Africa is in our home.
All right?
Can we still go back?
Why can't we?
No matter what happened, it's still our home.
What if after a few years,
It doesn't work and we have to part again?
That won't happen.
What if it does?
In case it does?
If you don't give us a chance today,
how would you know what will happen tomorrow?
Promise me.
Promise you what?
Promise me to take the challenge...
and marry me.
-Sam. -Yes?
Let's not go.
All right, let's get off then.
Sam, the plane is leaving.
What should we do?
-Let's take an early honeymoon. -What?
Please fasten your seatbelt, sir.
What should we do?
Let's go for a holiday.
What do you mean "holiday"? It's a 20-hour flight.
-I won't make it. -You'll be fine.
It's no different than being trapped in an elevator.
-Of course it's different! -What?
-It's not the same! -What should we do?
-I'm scared. Look, it's shaky. -Just calm down!
-I need oxygen. -Calm down!
Pull it down to me!
-Calm down! -Press the bell!
-Come here! -Get a hold of yourself!
