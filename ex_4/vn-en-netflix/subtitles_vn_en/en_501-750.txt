Did you, um... Did you set the alarm before we left?
Yeah, it was the last thing I did.
No, I was the last one to leave.
I was the last one to leave and I'm sure I didn't set it.
No, darling. I was the last one out.
And I did. I promise.
You sure? -Yeah. -Okay.
No, no, I was the last one, because I went back in.
And that means the alarm is not set.
-Because I didn't set it. -Well... I guess that means we'll be coming home to a large bunch of hippies sleeping in our bed.
to a large bunch of hippies sleeping in our bed.
What? Just like your old college days?
-[rumbling] -[gasps] It's all right. It's fine. It's just turbulence, Maria.
[female announcer on PA] Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to begin our descent into Phuket Airport.
The local time is 1:30 in the afternoon...
What are you doing? It's time to sit down. -We're about to land, darling. -Lucas won't talk to me.
-We're about to land, darling. -Lucas won't talk to me.
We ask that you fasten your seatbelt
We ask that you fasten your seatbelt and return your seat to the upright position.
Take my seat.
What did I do? I didn't do anything.
It's all right. Just sit down and stop worrying. Buckle up.
[Stewardess] sit down, please, madame.
Lucas...
-Lucas. -What?
You know, you could try being a bit nicer to your brother. He's just scared.
So what else is new? Everything scares him.
I wonder who he takes after.
[Maria] All right.
Take your stuff. Don't forget all your bags.
[Maria] Thomas! Your bag.
[man] Have you been to Khao Lak before?
[Henry] No, it's our first time.
[man] This is the best holiday season ever.
All resorts are full, but this area is really quiet.
It's great for families.
The Orchid Beach Resort is brand new. We just opened a week ago. You'll love it here.
We just opened a week ago. You'll love it here. All right.
[Maria] I'm sorry, but we made a booking on the third floor. The Sea View Room.
[man] I know. We are sorry. That was a mistake.
But we feel you might like this better.
-Where do you come from? -[Henry] Japan.
[man] You don't look Japanese.
[Henry] No, well, I work for a big company there and we move around a lot. You know?
And you? You don't work?
I'm a doctor.
I'm not practicing right now. Just taking care of the kids.
I see. You got promoted.
[Henry] Oh, that's nice, isn't it?
-Mom! -Yes?
Can I have one of these, please?
Lucas, if you're thirsty, will you just...
[all] Drink some juice or a glass of water. [Maria] Exactly.
[Henry] Boys, come and see this. -Come on. -Look.
Oh, yeah, look. Look at this.
Isn't it great? Yeah?
[Simon] Dad? Can we swim in there?
[Henry] Yeah, we can go swimming. Yeah.
[all] Ten, nine, eight,
[all] Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,
seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
four, three, two, one.
Blast off!
[Thomas] That one isn't going up!
-[Maria] Yes, it is. -[Henry] It is going up.
[Thomas] No, it's not. It's going a different way than the others.
It's going all the way up now.
-It's catching up! -Yeah, it's catching up.
[Lucas] No, Dad, it's going in the opposite direction.
We got any of that wine left?
[Maria whispering] They're fast asleep.
[Henry] Hey, baby.
Good morning.
Good morning.
-[Lucas] Get off! -[Henry laughing]
Wake up!
-What are you doing? -[Simon] It's Christmas!
[Henry] It's Christmas morning! It's Christmas!
Coins!
The money's leading this way.
Oh, the money's going outside! [Maria] No, no, no!
Wait, wait! One at a time!
[all] Oh!
[Henry] Oh, a telescope!
Oh, it's the complete nova stars... It's like, you can stick on your ceiling.
-It's the whole Milky Way. -And then they light up?
-It's the whole Milky Way. -And then they light up? Oh, look at this gorgeous scarf! I love it.
Oh, look at this gorgeous scarf! I love it.
Thank you, darling. [Henry] That's all right, my love.
I mean Santa Claus.
[Henry] What have you got, wee man?
-[Simon] A ball. -[Henry] A ball?
[Henry] Come on! The ball!
I can't get to sleep.
Must be jet lag. [Maria] Yeah. Sure.
[Maria] Yeah. Sure.
Can we go outside and watch the stars?
Maybe tomorrow.
Shh. Just close your eyes and think of something nice.
One all.
-Mom! -Hi. Come play ball with me.
In a minute, darling. Play with Lucas.
Can't believe you.
-You're hopeless. -What?
I'm gonna hide that thing and forget where I put it.
I was just checking to see about the house -we put a bid on in Japan. -[chuckling] Liar.
-we put a bid on in Japan. -[chuckling] Liar.
The truth is I got a text
saying that Yunioshi has been given a two-year extension on his contract.
Which means there will be two of us doing the same job.
And that can only really mean one thing.
They can't fire you.
That would be too expensive. Don't worry.
Well, I do worry because we can't afford to lose this job, can we?
[Lucas] Hey, Dad! Come and play with us!
I could go back to work. Maybe it's time.
I could go back to work. Maybe it's time. -In Japan? -No.
-In Japan? -No.
Oh, you want to go home?
It's not the worst idea, is it?
Well, we should think about it.
But I'm gonna play with the boys now, so...
[Lucas] Here, Dad!
Dad, they are the worst trunks ever!
-Awful! -[Thomas] They're awful, Dad!
-No, you're the awful! -[Simon] Yes, they are!
-[Henry] Boys! Oh! -[Simon] Fish!
-[Thomas] Try to splash 'em! -[Lucas] Ha, ha, beat you! [Henry] Lucas!
[Henry] Oh, no!
Go get it, Lucas! Go on!
-Henry, the boys! -Lucas!
Dad!
Lucas!
[Lucas] Mom! Help!
-Lucas! -Mom!
-Lucas! -Help me!
Lucas!
Help me! Help!
Get me out of this, Mom!
Lucas! Stay there!
Mom! Hold on! Hold on!
Hold on! Hold on! Mom!
-Mom! Swim towards me! -Be careful!
Grab that mattress!
-Lucas, swim to the mattress! -Mom!
Lucas! Swim!
Mom!
Mom!
-I want to go home! -Grab my hand!
Mom!
[Lucas] Come on!
Grab on.
-Mom! -Lucas!

-Lucas! -Mom!
[man] Someone help! Someone help!
[Maria] Lucas!
Lucas, go under!
Mom!
Mom...
Mom!
No...
Mom!
Mom. Mom.
Mom... Mom!
Mom!
-Lucas! -Mom!
Never do that to me again, Mom.
Never do that to me again, Mom.
-I'm here. -Never do that to me again.
We have to find somewhere safe.
It's okay. I'm here.
Mom... Mom, look, that tree. That tree over there.
Mom, look, that tree. That tree over there. Yes. Yes. Yes, it's perfect. It's perfect.
Yes. Yes. Yes, it's perfect. It's perfect.
Careful, Lucas.
Don't... Don't move.
Stay really still.
I thought I was a brave kid, Mom.
I'm scared.
I'm scared, too.
Is it over?
Is it over?
I don't know. I don't know.
Mom?
What?
You're bleeding, Mom.
[Maria whimpering] Oh, God.
It's okay.
-I can't see you like this. -[Maria] It's okay, it's okay.
Sorry. I just... Sorry.
[Maria] You go first.
That tree there, the big one. Do you think we can climb it?
Okay, let's go.
-Wait. Did you hear that? -[screaming continues]
-There's nothing we can do. -Wait...
We are almost there. We have to get to safety.
No, we have to help that boy.
Mom, if another wave catches us down here, we will die.
We have to climb that tree right now. Come on.
Where are you? Mom, look at you! We need help!
We cannot risk it.
We can't risk it, Mom. Come on.
Listen...
What if that boy was Simon or Thomas?
What if they needed help?
You'd want someone to help them, wouldn't you?
Simon and Thomas are dead!
Even if it's the last thing we do.
[Lucas] Where are you?
Look there, Mom! I see him!
Are you okay?
-Yeah, he's okay. He's okay. -[crying]
What's your name?
I'm Lucas. What's your name?
-Daniel. -Okay, Daniel. Okay, come on.
You're gonna be okay. We're gonna get you out. Okay?
[Maria] Lift him up.
-[screaming] -It's all right. It's all right.
Okay. Are you okay?
-[Daniel crying] -It's okay, it's okay! Don't worry. Everything's okay.
Don't worry. Everything's okay. Okay? You stay here. I'll be back. Okay?
Okay? You stay here. I'll be back. Okay?
Mom, coming down. Just give me a second.
No. I can do it.
-No, Mom, I'm coming down. -I can do it, Lucas!
Just stay there. Please.
[Lucas] Mom? Mom...
Thank you. Thank you.
Did you hear that?
Mom, look! Look, they're coming for us!
[yelling] Hey! Over here!
Hey!
Go on down, Lucas.
Lucas! Please...
[sobbing] Oh, no, no, no! God, please! No...
[weakly] Lucas?
-Lucas? -Mom, I'm here.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thank you.
[sobbing] Thank you...
Thank you. Thank you so much.
My boys...
I cannot see them, my boys...
My boys.
Don't let them take me anywhere without you.
Don't worry, Mom. I'm not gonna leave you alone. I promise.
Where's Daniel? Daniel? Daniel. Lucas, where's Daniel?
-I don't know. -Daniel...
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
[sighing] It's so cold in here.
It's not cold, Mom.
Don't move.
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?
I need some antibiotics. Look in the cupboard.
Oh, God. I can't read the labels. They're all in Thai.
There's got to be some English. Look... Look on the sides. Look carefully, Lucas.
Look on the sides. Look carefully, Lucas.
Oh, thank God. Oh, please.
See that boy?
I'm all he's got in the world. Do you understand?
I'm a doctor, too. I've got a lot of bleeding.
You've got to stop it, please.
I need some antibiotics. Please help.
[male doctor] Are you okay?
I lost my husband and two children.
If anything happens to me...
What color is it?
-What? -My leg.
Is it still red?
Yeah. It's still red.
-[moans] -What does that mean? It's good. As long as it doesn't turn black.
It's good. As long as it doesn't turn black.
You need to eat something. Eat it.
You're so bossy.
I wonder who I take after.
[Maria] Hello.
What's your name?
My name's Maria. And this is my son, Lucas.
What's your name?
Hey. Give her some tangerine.
She must be starving.
Be careful.
Turn your head to the side, please. You'll choke if you don't.
Please, please, she needs help. Turn her head.
Help her, Lucas. Help her. Turn her head.
-Mom, are you okay? -[gasping]
Mom? Mom? Are you okay? What are you doing?
-Mom, are you okay? -[speaking Thai]
Stop it, Mom! That's enough! Mom, stop it!
Stop it, Mom! That's enough! Mom, stop it! -Mom... -[gasping]
Mom, stop it!
Mom? Mom?
[man] Francesca!
Francesca!
Francesca!
[woman] I need to go to the toilet.
Please...
Lucas. Look at this place. It's so busy in here.
Look at this place. It's so busy in here.
You've got to go and do something.
Go and help people. You're good at it.
[Lucas] What do you want me to do? Something.
Anything.
Will you be all right?
Come on, Lucas. I'm...
[chuckling weakly] I'm not going anywhere.
-I promise. -Okay.
Bernstrom!
Three! Bernstrom!

I will bring your pappa here. Okay?

You have to stay here because it's a very long way, and you have to rest. Okay?
-Okay. -Okay.
Bernstrom!
Where's my mom?

[man on PA] Hotel, we have prepared transport for you.
We have to move to the Sangdee camp.
Move, everyone, please. You can't just stay here.
Hey, man! You all right?
I just need to lie here a minute.
I'll be up in a second.
Don't even bother. They're sending trucks to drive us all up to the mountains.
Just hang on tight, all right? They'll be here soon.
Yeah, I know. Can you tell them I'm back?
Yeah, I know. Can you tell them I'm back? Yeah, sure. Hold on.
Hey, boys! Your daddy's back!
[Thomas and Simon] Dad! Dad! Dad!
-Dad! -Dad!
Hey. Dad, a whole lot of helicopters just flew by!
Dad, a whole lot of helicopters just flew by!
-Did they? -Yeah.
Mom and Lucas?
Why don't you come down here a minute, Thomas.
What about me?
You stay and see if you can see any more helicopters. Okay?
-Okay. -Good boy.
[man] You're almost there, buddy. You got it?
I still haven't found them.
Did you see a lot of dead people?
What happened was very serious, Thomas.
Not Mom and Lucas, right? No, I didn't see them.
I burnt my feet on the roof.
It was really hot, and everyone was leaving.
Oh. Can we leave yet?
I need you to, um...
I need you to do me a favor, Thomas.
I've heard everyone's going to the mountains,
to a shelter where it's really safe.
But I can't go with you.
You can't leave us alone again, Dad.
I have to keep looking for them, you see.
You have to look after Simon... No! No, stay with us. I can't look...
No! No, stay with us. I can't look...
I've never looked after someone before. I'm scared.
I've never looked after someone before. I'm scared. I know. I know. I'm scared, too.
I know. I know. I'm scared, too.
But do you know the most scary bit for me?
When the water hit? No. After that.
No. After that. When I came up, and I was all on my own.
That was the scariest part.
And then I saw the two of you clinging to the tree, and I...
I didn't feel so scared anymore, because I knew I wasn't on my own, you see?
What if Mommy and Lucas are on their own right now?
Imagine how scared they'll be.
We'll look for them together. No. Thomas, you have to look after Simon.
No. Thomas, you have to look after Simon.
And I'm going to keep looking for them.
Okay?
Okay?
I know you understand.
[man on PA] Everyone move out. You can't stand here.
There might be another wave coming soon. No doubt.
Hello? Yeah, I can hear you.
Nobody knows what's going on.
Are you all right? Have you lost someone?
We're fine. We just want to get out of here.
I'll call you back. Okay? Bye.
Uh, excuse me. I've been trying to place a call back home all day.
I wondered, could I use your phone?
-It would be really quick. -Look around you, man. Everybody's needing something right now.
But our battery is almost dead. We need the phone.
[female employee] Yes, as I said, we are trying to clear the road, but...
[woman] I understand, but I'd like to talk to somebody in charge who knows a little bit more.
to somebody in charge who knows a little bit more.
[Henry] I'll see you in the morning, okay?
You're not coming?
I'm not coming, wee man, no.
Thomas will take care of you, all right?
Listen to me. You're gonna behave yourselves, okay?
And you stay with this group,
and I'm gonna be with you just as soon as I can, okay?
You're gonna behave yourselves, okay?
I love you.
Will you look out for my boys for me, please?
Come with us. [whispers] You know it's useless.
I can't stop looking.
-[banging on truck] -I love you. I'll be with you tomorrow, I promise.
I love you.
[Henry] Maria!
Lucas!
Maria!
Oh, no. No.
[man] Hey, man, are you okay?
Get in the car. We'll drive you somewhere safer.
[Karl] My wife didn't want to come to Thailand for Christmas holidays,
because of my leg.
I insisted. My little girl, Gina,
she's just two.
The noise woke me up.
I was alone in the room.
I went out to the terrace and saw the sea coming inland.
It took me five seconds to reach the stairs, but the water was already there.
It was not more than five seconds.
[sniffling] On the bed, I found a note from my wife,
saying that they were at the beach.
[man] You were at the Orchid, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, my whole family were in the swimming pool when the water hit.
I found my middle son first, Thomas. He was... He was at the top of this really tall tree.
Took me ages to convince him to come down because he was so scared, you know?
And then I found my little one, Simon.
He was holding onto a palm tree.
He's only five.
I sent them to the mountains.
You know? So that I could keep looking for my wife and my other son.
Toughest choice I ever made.
-Have you called home yet? -I can't find a phone.
[Karl] I'm saving my battery. Just in case my family calls.
Please.
Thank you. I'll be very quick, I promise.
-Yes? -Brian?
Yes, Henry, thank God. How are you guys?
Did you hear from anyone yet? No, Henry, you're the first to call.
Is everybody all right? -Henry? -Maria and Lucas are not here.
-Henry? -Maria and Lucas are not here.
What do you mean, "not there"?
[sobbing] The water came and swept everyone away.
And I found... I found Thomas and Simon, but I don't know where Maria and Lucas are.
Henry? Don't do that.
And I don't know what to do, I don't know where to look for them. [sobs]
[Brian] Henry. Henry, calm down. Henry? Henry?
Brian, I have to go.
Brian, I have to go. Lots of people need to use this phone, okay?
-I'll just call you later. -Henry?
Sorry. I'm sorry, sorry.
Thank you.
What do you want me to do?
You can't leave it like that. Go on!
You can't leave it like that. Go on! -Come on! -[woman] Go on.
-Come on! -[woman] Go on.
-[man 1] Come on, man. -[man 2] Come on.
I should call him back.
-Yes, Henry? -Brian, it's me again. Look, I promise you that I won't stop looking
Look, I promise you that I won't stop looking -until I find them. Okay? -Okay.
[Henry] I don't know what I'm gonna do
because it's nighttime now, but I'll... I'll look in all the hospitals.
-[Brian] Okay. -And I'll look
in all the shelters and everything, okay? I will find them, I promise you that.
-I'll call you when I do. -Okay.
-Okay. Okay. -Okay.
[Henry] Thanks.
Can I go with you?
[Simon] I'm scared.
[Thomas] Close your eyes. Think of something nice.
[woman] May I sit with you?
How old are you?
Almost 74. And you?
Seven and a half.
Get these ants off me.
-Is he all right? -Yeah, he's asleep. He's fine.
He's got a bit of ant bites on him. He's all right.
[woman] You like looking at stars, don't you?
I do. At home I can find most of the constellations.
But here in the sky, it's different.
Some of those stars
have been burnt out for a long, long time.
Did you know that?
They're dead, aren't they?
They're dead.
But once they were so bright
that their light is still traveling through space.
We can still see them.
How can you tell which ones are dead and which ones are not?
Oh, you can't. It's impossible.
It's a beautiful mystery, isn't it?
[nurse] Lucas Bennett? Can you come with me?
Sit here.
Your name is Lucas Bennett, is that right?
Yeah. And your mother's name is Maria Bennett.
-Is that correct? -Uh-huh.
We'd like you to look at these things, please,
and see if you recognize any of them.
Have a good look.
Take your time.
[woman] Does anything look familiar?
I don't know.
You don't know?
[woman] Do you recognize anything?
-I don't think so. -You don't think so?
[nurse] Lucas...
Could you please come with us?
[Lucas] Mom.
[weakly] Where the hell have you been?
Where the hell have I been?
Where the hell were you?
You promised me you weren't going anywhere.
I thought you were dead, Mom.
I'm sorry. I thought you were dead.
[nurse] We're so sorry.
Someone must have changed her records during surgery.
How is she?
She's had surgery on her chest.
But she lost a lot of blood.
She was too weak to have her leg operated on.
She has to go back to surgery when she recovers.
But she'll be okay, right?
Nothing. What next?
We should, uh... We should try and get a ride to Takuapa Hospital.
-Where are my kids? -They're taking them away.
They wouldn't let me go with them. I'm sorry.
-Where? -I don't know.
I need to pee.
You have to wait, Simon.
Mom. Mom.
Mom. Mom. Lucas...
Mom, guess who I just saw outside?
My leg. What color is my leg?
It's still red.
Please. My mom.
Her wounds are looking really bad.
We are doing the best we can.
We are taking your mom to surgery right away.
[driver] No more sick here since yesterday.
It's full. We move out. No, no, no! Five minutes. Give me five minutes, please.
No, no, no! Five minutes. Give me five minutes, please. Please.
I don't want you to slow down.
These are the names of my little girl, Gina, and Kathy, my wife. She's American.
my wife. She's American.
Would you check the list for me?
-[Henry] Of course. -[woman] Please. They told us our daughter could be in Surat Thani.
And we've already been to this hospital.
We have checked all hospitals but this one. Please.
[Henry] Five minutes, please. Just only five minutes.
Okay. I won't be long. I'll be right back.
[weakly] Lucas.
Lucas.
Anything left in the can?
Don't worry. I'll get you something.
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
I need to pee! -Can you hold it? -No.
-Can you hold it? -No.
Simon! What are you doing?
[woman] Boys! Get back on the bus right now!
Hurry up! They're gonna leave us here! What are you doing?
No luck. Sorry.
Sorry. And thanks for waiting.
[driver] Okay. We go now.
Dad!
It's Lucas.
-Lucas! -Lucas!
-Lucas! -Lucas!
-Lucas! -Lucas!
-Lucas! -Lucas!
-Lucas! -Lucas!
Simon! Thomas! Lucas! Lucas!
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas!
Thomas! Simon! Lucas! Lucas!
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas!
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas!
-Lucas! -Simon!
Searched everywhere...
Simon. Thomas.
Are you okay?
Lucas!
Dad! Dad...
Dad! Dad... Dad. Dad?
Lucas!
-Dad! -Lucas!
Dad!
[Thomas and Simon] Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I left you both. Dad, we did it.
Dad, we did it.
Let's go. No need to wait.
Are you okay? Are you okay?
-[Lucas] Mom is here. -What?
She's really weak. She says some weird stuff sometimes.
The nurse says they're gonna try and operate on her as soon as they can.
I think it's serious.
Mom? Mom.
Look who's here.
Hey.
Hey, my darling.
[Simon] Mom.
[Henry] We're all okay.
Am I dead? No. No.
It's okay to take this off?
Here, here, here. I've got it.
-You came back. -Yes.
I can rest now.
Maria, what? What? What, darling?
I'm dying. No. No.
You're going to be fine.
Take care of our babies.
Hey, that's not what I came here for.
You're gonna be fine. They're gonna take good care of you, okay?
I promise you, we're gonna be fine.
Oh, Henry, I'm scared.
We're gonna be fine.
Henry...
Sweetheart, I promise you're gonna be okay.
We're taking her to surgery. We need to take her now.
[Henry] Okay.
I love you.
You're gonna be okay.
I love you so much. I love you.
I love you, Maria. You know that, don't you?
I'm sorry if I let you down in any way.
[Henry] Lucas.
Thanks for taking care of Mom.
We took care of each other.
[Lucas] Dad? [Henry] Yeah.
[Lucas] There's something I didn't tell Mom.
And I really need her to know.
I have a family, too.
I've been saving my strength
because I want to see them
one more time.
Oh. Do you have to?
We don't want you to feel any pain.
I'm afraid to go to sleep. Shh. You're in good hands.
Shh. You're in good hands.
Close your eyes and think of something nice.
Think of something nice.
[Henry] Lucas! [Lucas] Dad!
Mom's okay, Lucas.
We're going home.
[Henry] Be careful. You okay?
[Tudpole] Mr. Bennett! Mr. Bennett!
[Tudpole] Mr. Bennett! Mr. Bennett! I'm Oliver Tudpole from Zurich Insurance.
They sent me to take care of your family. You have nothing to worry about now.
In a few hours, you'll be at Singapore General Hospital,
where your wife will receive the best treatment in all of Asia.
These people will take you onto the plane. I'll see you once you're there.
Have a safe flight.
[Maria] Where are we going?
They'll take us to Singapore. You'll be safe there, okay?
Oh, please take your seat. We'll be taking off shortly.
Okay.
-Can I just... -Yeah. Okay. One minute.
How are you?
Here. With you.
Mom. Guess what?
I saw Daniel again.
He was so happy.
He was in somebody's arms.
I bet it was his dad, Mom.
I love you.
[sobbing] Lucas, I love you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.
[nurse] I'm sorry, but you have to go back to your seat now.
Fasten your seatbelts, please.
I don't want to. [Henry] Why not? You have to do your seatbelts up in a plane.
-You're gonna be late. -I know.
-God, that guy's such an ass. -Stacey.
What? He almost just ran me over in his douchemobile.
You shouldn't be getting out that side anyway.
Go out that side.
Honey, did you get the list from Miss Collier?
-Yeah, I've already done it. -Okay, great.
-Of course you have. -Really?
-Girls. -I hear it all day.
"Your sister was such a great student. Emma just loved this book."
Stace, enough.
So, I have a showing at 5:00. I'll be home around 6:00-ish.
-Any dinner requests? -Anything's good. Bye, Mom.
Bye, sweetie. I love you.
She's the perfect girl and I'm the bad sister.
No, you're not. Have a great day, honey. Bye.
Breathe, Em.
They're just probably gonna talk about stuff we already know.
The only reason I'm going is to get out of first period.
-We can be a little late. -Not really.
Oh, my dog, you're going to explode if you stay this tight.
Speaking of tight...
Hey, Emma.
-"Hey, Emma"? He fricking knows your name. -I guess.
Stephen Sullivan knows your name.
Can we go to class now, please?
Will you sleep with him, please? For me.
All right, listen up, everybody.
The bus will be leaving at 7:00 a.m. sharp tomorrow, so be on time.
Otherwise...
Sorry, prom queen.
-Hey, you two, find a seat. Let's go. -What?
I expect it from Mr. McMullen, but I'd hope better from you, Emma.
-Sorry, Mr. Christiansen. -All right.
So tomorrow the bus will be leaving at 7:00 a.m. sharp, all right?
Be on time, or the bus will be leaving without you.
How'd Lonely Boy get on this trip? Daddy probably bought his way on.
-What? -You know I can hear you, right?
For the first five days in Trinidad,
we'll be helping to renovate a school with Project Humanity.
The last three days, we'll be exploring the island
and going on cultural excursions throughout the country,
and it should be a lot of fun.
So, headline, Stephen knows Emma's name.
Say what?
Yeah, I'll trade you for your burger.
-You can have it. -You sure?
Yeah, I just wanted the fries.
Okay, wait, so Emma and Stephen?
-I kind of like that. -Yeah.
We have one week on the island to work our weebee magic
and get young Emma here laid by the quarterback.
-Do I have a say in this? -No, not at all.
-We're there to be helping people. -And I'm trying to "help" you.
We have jobs to do, Lizzie. I have looked at the itinerary.
You made the itinerary.
The school has every day and night planned.
So? We'll change the plans. I mean, that's life, right?
And BTdubs, I just found out that Carnival in Trinidad is when we're there.
Oh, my God. I totally have to get a new bathing suit.
-Really? -What?
Emma's scoping Lonely Boy.
He was in my middle school. He used to be really nice.
Yeah, used to be.
I heard he got kicked out of the last school he was in.
No. I think he's kind of cute
in, like, a Rebel Without a Cause, Holden Caulfield kind of way.
Let me make it simple.
Girls like our Em don't hook up with freaks like what's-his-face.
Especially when she's got the quarterback on the hook.
You can hand me that now.
-Busted! -Loser.
You can follow me to the principal's office.
Well, then lead the way.
-Way to go, pal. -Well done.
Looks like someone's not going on the trip.
Well, folks, it looks like we're in for another...
How long you planning on staying?
You can never be too prepared, Phil.
Thank you guys so much for letting me go on this.
No worries, sweetie.
So what if I had to take a second mortgage out?
Your mom may have to sell an extra mansion this month, but...
Don't tell her that.
I love our kids so much.
Man, if this is what you two are like for an eight-day trip,
I don't wanna know what's it gonna be like to send her off to college?
I know.
So I'm thinking we're gonna have to move to Princeton with you.
I support that idea.
-Right? -Yep.
Wouldn't you love that?
What are you talking about, you don't wanna go?
Know what kind of strings I had to pull to get you back on this trip?
For who, Dad? Me or you?
'Cause I don't even wanna go on this stupid trip.
Just gonna be forced to hang with a bunch of people
I never talk to when I'm here anyway.
It's an opportunity, son.
It's a chance to do something for someone other than yourself.
Can we go? We're gonna be late.
I'd be stuck here, and you'd have to look at my face all week.
Let's go, gang. All aboard!
-Be careful. -Emma, Lizzie.
-Be safe, you girls. Love you. -Say bye to Mom.
Let's get a move. Come on.
Dean, be safe.
Will do, Father.
How you doing, Emma? Crazy early, right?
That was two sentences. He's upping his game.
You are so getting laid.
Okay, everybody listen up. Project starts tomorrow.
Which means we have a few hours today
to get settled in and go hang by the pool if you want.
Then we're all gonna go have dinner.
What'd I tell you, Em? Screw your schedule.
This is gonna be the best ever.
No locals. Damn. Oh, well. Who's the lucky boy?
Don't worry, Em. I'm not gonna steal your quarterback.
All right, ladies. Let's do this.
One, two...
Yeah, ladies.
Don't splash me.
-Gotcha. -No!
All right, man, good job. Spread it out now.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Be careful up there.
Whatever you say, boss.
He's gonna get freaking killed and ruin it for all of us.
You should get some lotion on your shoulders.
You're gonna burn.
Day two and first contact has been made?
Yes, please.
This is gonna be easier than I thought.
Looks like mama's getting some vac-action.
Game on, dudes.
-Skyping. -With the 'rentals.
Okay, get off now. Seriously, it's urgent.
Honey, are you all right?
Yeah. Sorry, Miss Collier is calling lights out.
All right, all right, go ahead. We love you. Have fun.
-Get a good night's sleep, babe. -Love you guys. Bye.
-Bye, honey. -Good night.
Okay, so I'm downstairs buying freaking toothpaste because I ran out.
And can you believe they charge $5...
-Losing. -Okay.
Headline, Carnival party tonight on some local dude's boat. I know.
And Stephen invited us, and he singled you out, young Emma.
They're leaving right now, but the boat leaves in a half-hour.
-I don't know. -Shut it.
We are going. You are going,
even if I have to tie you up and drag you to the boat.
Seriously, we'll be done by midnight.
-2:00, the latest. -Okay.
Carnival!
Thank you.
Want a taxi?
Go.
Carnival, bitches!
Hurry, we're gonna miss it.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
-Don't leave. -Run for it.
This is so fun.
-Hey, ladies, what's up? -No, that's okay.
How you doin'?
Okay, let's get a cocktail and find your man.
Not my man and not drinking.
Em, you've gotta loosen up. You know, switch it around.
-Get out of your element just a little. -I like my element.
I'm gonna go find Helen.
Is that your new boyfriend?
What's it to you?
Monte Carlo.
Prepare to be boarded.
Monte Carlo, this is the Trinidad Police.
Heave to and prepare to be boarded.
Move to the front of the boat.
Move to the bow of the boat.
Monte Carlo, this is the Trinidad Police.
-Emma! -Help!
Monte Carlo, this is the Trinidad Police.
-What the hell are you doing? -What the hell does it look like? I fell.
-Where's Emma? -I don't know, I thought she was with you.
Climb up.
-You all right? -Just great.
What are you doing?
I'm in enough trouble. I can't get busted.
Are you crazy? You think we're gonna dodge the cops?
We'll be fine. We'll go back to the hotel when things cool down, okay?
On this? I wanna get back on the boat.
-They're getting too far away. -We'll just hang back and follow them.
-We'll be fine. -Hurry.
We won't be able to see the boat.
-How are we gonna get out of here? -I'm working on it, all right?
-Do you even know which way to go? -Be quiet. Let me think.
-Damn it, no motor. -No motor? What now, genius?
-I don't know. -What do you mean, you don't know?
We're stuck out here in the middle of nowhere.
This isn't some stupid little thing...
Hold on.
Please put your suitcases by the door to be loaded into the awaiting cabs.
And I'd especially like to thank those of you
who brought this unique opportunity to an abrupt end.
Welcome, gentlemen. Glad you could make it.
Too bad you're on your way home.
-Miss Collier, Emma's not here. -What?
She never came home last night.
And I didn't tell anyone because I thought,
she was with someone or something, but I really...
Okay, well, how do you know that she's not?
You know her, Miss Collier. She wouldn't just bail.
She has a schedule to keep.
And I tried her cell, and she's not answering.
All right, well, where did you see her last?
On the boat.
How far do you think we've drifted?
I don't know. Just keep an eye out. Can't be that far.
We've been out here for hours. Was this part of your brilliant plan?
I can't believe my phone got totally soaked.
Yeah, I can't believe that either.
Try your phone again.
I told you, I'm not getting reception out here.
-You want some more water? -Thanks.
I can't believe you brought water to a party.
I didn't wanna get dehydrated. That's what gives you a hangover.
Really? I thought it was the tequila.
I still can't believe there's no motor.
I mean, that's the point of the dinghy, right? For emergencies.
Why else have the damn dinghy?
-What? How is that funny? -Dinghy's funny.
It's a funny word, "dinghy."
We're floating in the middle of the Caribbean.
-You know that, right? -Yeah.
I also know that freaking out isn't gonna make us any less screwed, so...
So, what do we do?
For now, we float, I guess.
Want some gum?
Why, is my breath bad?
Probably.
-Elizabeth Kover. -Here.
Samuel Leifer.
Here.
Dean McMullen.
Dean? Dean McMullen?
Anyone seen Dean?
-You should try that. -No, thanks.
You want me to get your back?
-What's with all the Ziplocs? -What?
You carry all your crap in baggies?
It keeps things from getting messy.
How's that working out for you?
Well, at least my phone is dry.
We should've followed the police boat back to shore.
-What, with a single paddle? Sure. -I'm just saying.
Okay, first of all, I figured we'd be able to row back in later.
And second of all, lest we forget, prom queen,
you were the one who decided to take a moonlight dip into stormy waters.
I fell off the boat.
And my name is Emma.
Okay, Emma.
-Oh, my God. -What?
-Island, there. -Where?
-Right there. Okay. -That's way too far.
We should sit here until someone picks us up.
Are you kidding?
-Fine, I'll paddle. -Okay, okay.
I'll paddle. Jeez.
She never made it back to the hotel last night?
-No. And I thought that maybe she was... -Was she drinking?
-What does that have to do with anything? -Was she with Dean?
-What? No. -But he was on the boat?
Yeah, but she didn't meet anyone. And she wasn't hooking up with Dean.
-Miss Collier, tell them... -Can anything be done to find them?
More than likely, they'll find you.
I mean, this type of thing isn't terribly uncommon.
It's the youthful spirit of adventure.
No, this is my best friend we're talking about.
I know her.
She has no youthful spirit of adventure.
Dean!
You okay?
Yeah.
You?
Yeah. Think so.
No coverage. We'll have to find a phone.
Great.
Wait up.
Come on.
Really? Who's that for?
I don't know. Shoot the bad guys?
No, you finish it. I could use a coffee.
Like, a mocha ice blended with an extra shot.
Oh, man. How good would that be?
-What was that? -I hate bugs.
Well, you've come to the right place, then.
Let's just find a hotel.
We're supposed to finish working on the school today.
I'll bet everyone's probably all worried about us.
You, maybe.
I can promise you nobody's worried about me.
Yeah, this is Jack.
I'm sorry, what?
-Excuse me. Mrs. Robinson? -Barbara.
-Jack McMullen. I'm Dean's father. -Nice to meet you.
What were they doing on the boat in the first place, and who was watching them?
-Now, Mrs. Robinson... -Don't condescend to me.
Don't you dare condescend to me. I trusted you with our daughter.
They can't find her.
It's okay, we'll find her. When is the next flight?
There's a red-eye tonight from Miami that makes connections in Trinidad.
There's not an earlier flight?
No, that's the earliest there is. I can help you with some arrangements...
No, you've done enough. Thank you. Let's go.
My feet are killing me.
I fricking hate hiking.
-You wanna wear my Chucks? -It's okay.
Thanks, though.
Hey, look.
-Stop. -What? They're berries.
"White and yellow, kill a fellow. Purple and blue, good for you."
You're a little bit weird. You know that, right?
Been called worse.
Oh, my...
It's beautiful.
Come on. We gotta keep going.
-Let's just find a hotel. -What?
We may never get back here again.
-Come on. Take a picture. -We're already in enough trouble.
You know they grade this trip. I cannot mess with my GPA.
Hello? Do you know how unique this is?
Okay. What's your number-one school?
Princeton. Why?
You know how many people applying to Princeton have a 4.0?
A lot.
You know how many people have been swimming in this waterfall?
Think of the essay you could write.
Come on.
We gotta find a hotel.
So lame. Fine.
See, this is why I don't hang out with people.
I can't wait until we get to a real bathroom.
I can't wait for a coffee.
Where are we?
We've been walking for hours.
And we haven't seen a single road, a person.
We better get back to the boat.
Come on, it's gonna be a long walk.
What if we have to spend the night on this island?
I don't think we're gonna find a five-star hotel around here.
-Do you know how to make a fire? -I do.
-Perfect. -What?
A cave?
I am not sleeping in a cave.
It's the safest place to be. Dry if it rains, only one way in.
Protection from the elements.
Hey, can I use your phone?
Sure. There's no signal.
I'm not a cave person.
None of us are cave persons.
We haven't been cave people for a long...
Go, go, go.
So, that's a no on the cave.
Where's the boat?
I'm really tired.
Can we take a break soon?
-Sure. -Thanks.
You see something?
No.
Use the flare gun. You need at least two flares.
I saw it in the book.
I think it was the one with the girl who sails around the world with her cat.
You're supposed to fire two flares, one to get their attention,
and the other so they can try and locate you.
Who's "they"?
The people that are gonna come get us, I guess.
Our families and the police or whoever.
Dean, what are you doing?
What was that about?
Hey, can I borrow some of that bug stuff?
-Sure. -Thanks.
-You want a pillow? -Thanks.
-Wait a sec. -What?
Damn, you should be on that Price Is Right show.
I knew it was in here.
I put it in there in case I got hungry when we were building yesterday.
Thanks.
And I think you meant Let's Make a Deal.
Right.
That show.
-Here's some more. -Thanks.
Flight 415 from Detroit to Miami scheduled to depart at 11:00 p.m.
is now expected to depart at 12:10 a.m. from Gate 211.
We're gonna get there.
Why do you call me "prom queen"?
-Aren't you? -No.
You seem like you should be. Perfect girl, perfect world.
I can't tell if you're being mean or nice.
What do you think's out there? In the woods.
-We're gonna be fine. -I know.
-Still can't get a signal. -Here.
What are you doing? You're gonna waste the battery.
Just playing some music.
Here.
-Take my shirt. -Thank you.
Sure.
-Night. -Night.
They'll come for us. I know it.
What was that?
Hey.
You're a morning person, huh?
What are you doing?
I'm trying to save us. What are you doing?
I don't know. Might go for a swim.
-Hey, where's your phone? -Battery's dead.
We need some more water.
The police have a boat searching the area where they picked up the kids.
As soon as they come back in...
And when will they be back? When is that?
I'm not sure. They said that they would let us know when they...
Any word?
I was just telling Barbara that the police
have a boat searching the Caribbean right now.
They did say that a dinghy was missing, so...
-How long have they been looking? -What about a helicopter?
They said as soon as the winds die down, they're gonna send someone up.
Have they been searching the land as well as the water?
Have you contacted the embassy?
Is there a private team we can hire? Because money is not an issue.
I understand. No, the police are doing everything that they can
with the limited resources that they have on the island.
There is no private rescue team.
But they did say they were very, very confident
that they're going to find Dean and Emma.
The first 48 hours is the most important.
But the Chief of Police said that, you know, kids do this...
Oh, God, if I hear one more time that this is what kids do...
-Are you kidding me? -It's been almost two days.
What the hell are these people doing?
Except offering anecdotal crap about other teenagers.
-All right, look, I'm sorry. -Don't be sorry.
Help us find our children.
The hut's just gonna be something in case it rains, you know.
Rain?
You never know.
You okay? Come here.
This may sting a little. Does that hurt?
Here, keep the pressure on it.
So, why Princeton?
Why do you wanna go to Princeton?
I don't know. It's Ivy League.
It's just where we talked about me going.
It's kind of weird, right?
It's always been where I wanted to go.
Where I was supposed to go.
I don't think I ever even questioned it.
Yeah.
They're not gonna give up.
No, they'll come. For you.
Thanks, guys.
Prepare to board in five minutes.
Sorry.
Did you find her?
Not yet, but we will.
Yeah, we're gonna go back out tomorrow.
Sweetie, your mom and I are gonna need to stay a few more days.
Is that okay?
Sure. Stay however long you need.
There we go. That should hold for a bit.
Seriously?
Okay, now it's good.
Celebration swim?
Come on.
Come on, it's, like, a million degrees. We earned it.
I cannot eat anymore fruit!
-Hey, prom queen! -Don't look.
I was just gonna ask if you had anymore sunscreen left.
I don't have any more anything left. You can look for yourself.
The bottles are in the baggies. They're piled in the hut.
-I looked for them, didn't see any. -They're there, but they're empty.
I'm sure there's some aloe somewhere. Now turn around and stop looking.
You know that every time you say that, it reminds me that I should be looking?
I'm serious.
You're the one who asked me to be here and stand guard.
There's something out there. I can hear it at night.
This afternoon, according to officials, the investigation has been downgraded
from a search-and-rescue to a search-and-recovery effort,
as hope of finding the pair alive has faded.
I want you to call me every day.
-Sometimes twice a day if you can, okay? -I will, I promise.
I just hate the idea of leaving you alone down here.
I'll be fine, honey. You've gotta go back.
Stacey needs one of us there, especially now.
No, I know. You're right.
Well, it's official. They called off the rescue search.
See, what this is about, they don't have the resources down here.
That's what it is.
...for the families and the students back home,
who have kept constant...
I'm not gonna stop, Phil.
I promise, I'll bring her back home.
I know you will.
Jack, thank you for hiring this.
We'll keep covering these waters.
We still have two hours of flying time.
I miss my mom and dad.
I even miss my little sister.
And my fish.
The smell of my sheets when they first get out of the dryer.
I'll bet they're still looking for us.
They'd have to be, right?
-You think they quit? -Would you?
I mean, you keep looking for something, at some point,
you figure it's gone, right?
Why do you do this? Watch the sunset every day?
-Looking for something. -What?
Nothing. It's stupid.
Zippo's dead.
We're gonna have to learn to make our own fire now.
What is it?
Oh, my God.
How long do you think he was there?
How long do you think that he pretended that he was gonna make it home?
This guy is not us, Em.
He could've been some local fisherman or drug smuggler or anyone.
You've got people out there who love you.
People looking for you.
And you know what else? We got each other.
And that's something right there, prom queen.
We're gonna be okay. You hear me?
Nothing bad's gonna happen to you.
Why are you crying?
That was...
That felt so good.
You make that sound like a bad thing.
It's just,
for a while, I forgot where we were.
I pictured us home,
worrying about what everybody was gonna say.
I felt so normal.
Hey, where's my latte?
I'm going to the lagoon.
Dean, did you take the big water bottle?
Dean?
-Why would you do that? -Do what?
Leave me there without saying where you were going or...
-You were sleeping. -And I woke up and you were nowhere.
-What are you doing? -He deserves to be buried.
Okay? At least have a funeral.
Dean, I don't understand. What...
-Talk to me. I'm here and... -You're here and what?
We had sex once. We're stuck on an island.
We're not soul mates.
That's mean.
Yeah, I'm not a nice guy, Emma. And now you know.
I don't believe that.
Whatever it is, I'll listen. Please, just give me...
Emma!
I'm so sorry, Em. I didn't mean to...
It was an accident. I fell.
I don't know what I'd do if something happened to you.
What are we doing?
We're not some happy couple on an island vacation.
How are we gonna make it day after day, just the two of us?
What if something goes wrong? I mean, what if I broke my leg,
or one of us gets sick or something like that?
Nobody knows what's out there, Em.
There's stuff all the time that we don't know how to deal with
and we just gotta figure it out.
I didn't go to my mom's funeral.
That's why I wanted to bury that guy. Just flesh.
Ashes to ashes.
I thought maybe seeing him dead in the ground and all that
would make things make sense.
Did it?
Not really.
I guess that's the point.
It doesn't always make sense.
We need hydrotherapy.
And you kind of stink, so...
Step into my office and tell me about your problems, Mr. McMullen.
I couldn't handle
seeing all of it.
You know, the casket and all the people pitying me.
Blaming me or...
Why would they blame you?
Because I killed her.
She was driving me home from soccer practice.
We were driving down this side road, and it was dark.
And we used to play this game when it was snowing
where she'd flick on the high beams, on and off.
And it'd look like we were going into hyperspace
from, like, a Star Wars movie or something like that.
I reached over, trying to be funny, trying to be like her.
Lost control of the car.
We were laughing, and the next thing...
I was in the hospital for three days.
When I got out, she was gone.
You didn't kill her.
No.
We should maybe think about moving here.
Nice neighborhood, and I hear the public schools are great.
Nearly a month after two students here at Walt Whitman High School
went missing off the coast of Trinidad,
the search for Emmaline Robinson and Dean McMullen
now has officially been called off.
It's believed that the students have been lost at sea.
I can't believe they're gonna stop looking for her.
Even if it's just for her body or something.
Helen, that's kind of morbid.
Well, her mom's still there. Maybe she'll find her.
I know that we've been over this,
but if you would just look at the new information
regarding the weather patterns the night of the party,
you would see that we've been looking in the wrong place.
Mrs. Robinson, I've seen this information.
-Perhaps your embassy can... -I've been to the embassy twice.
Excuse me, have you seen these two?
Sorry, folks, no planes taking off today.
They say the storm could last for days.
Yep.
When my wife died,
l tried so hard to keep her here, you know.
Keep her alive.
I almost lost everything I had.
Dean and I barely spoke.
I almost lost my partnership at the firm.
I was so focused on what I'd lost, I forgot what I had.
Maybe it's time to go home, Barbara.
It's not like we haven't tried.
It's a tough call.
Whenever we were at the beach,
my mom used to talk about the green flash.
My dad and I would watch and watch.
I've never seen it.
It's supposed to be right on the horizon line,
just as the sun comes down.
I'm thinking maybe it's just a thing
people believe in
to make them feel like there's something out there, you know?
Beauty or whatever.
How long do you really think we can survive here?
We're gonna be fine, okay?
Should we feel guilty?
For what?
Not being sad all the time.
They probably think we're dead.
But we're not dead.
So we gotta live a little, right?
I just feel like we should be doing something,
like trying to find a way off or...
We tried.
We'll keep trying.
Have you been shaving?
What?
You have, like, almost no beard.
Okay, first of all, bite me.
And second of all, it'll get heavier.
I hope.
Was that okay?
I mean,
was I okay?
Emma, you are so much better than okay.
Okay?
If okay is around here somewhere, you are way over the damn palm trees.
If okay is like a little tiny grain of sand, you're the whole beach.
If okay is like a little drop of water,
you're like the whole freaking Caribbean.
Need me to go on?
Okay.
You were never like this at school.
Like what?
I don't know, fun.
-You're different, too. -No, I'm not.
Yeah, you kind of are.
How so?
No posse, no books.
I used to watch you sometimes.
That's not creepy.
You always seemed like you had a plan.
Like you had something to do or somewhere to go.
I guess now you got nowhere to go, huh?
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I kind of like where I am.
And for the record, I watched you sometimes, too.
Who was your first time?
We're playing that game?
Yeah, we are. Who?
I was a sophomore and she was a junior.
Do I know her?
No, she was in college.
I don't know.
I thought she could teach me some stuff.
Was it fun?
All five minutes were a blast.
Okay, who was your first?
No, no, no.
No.
I told you mine, now you have to tell me yours.
Football player? Band geek?
-Teacher? -You.
What?
You.
Me?
I was your...
-Is that a bad "wow"? -No.
Just a "wow."
Was it okay?
I got sand in some weird places.
I'm glad it was me.
Me, too.
So since this is all pretty new to me,
maybe we should practice more.
Yeah.
Emma, did you hear that?
Plane! Get the flare gun. I'll catch up with you.
No, no, no.
Hey! Hey!
They were too high.
Did you fire both flares? I didn't see.
No, I couldn't find the gun.
What do you mean you couldn't find the gun?
It's in the same place it's always been.
This is our chance, Dean.
I don't understand. Where could it be?
-Did you move it? -No.
You're the only one who's ever picked it up.
So you're saying I lost it?
I'm not saying anybody lost it, I'm just saying it's not there.
Someone's been taking our stuff.
The baggies and my lotions and my sunscreen and toothpaste.
That stuff ran out a long time ago.
Yeah, but I kept the bottles.
I use them for aloe and for water and...
Where's the water bottle?
I don't know, it's probably there somewhere.
I bet you were just organizing things one day...
Really, organizing?
That's what happened, I organized too much.
Hang on.
-Emma. Emma. -Get off me.
-What are you doing? -I'm leaving.
I can't. I can't do this. I cannot stay on this island anymore!
What are you gonna do, swim back?
Emma.
Hello!
There's no one out there, is there?
Hello!
We've seen one plane since we've been here.
I'm never gonna see my family again.
We'll be better off in there, long-term.
What's long-term, Dean?
Look, Em, at some point, we're gonna have to say, "This is it."
This is our life, you know? It's you and me.
You hear that?
It's nothing. It's just the wind.
I'm gonna find whatever it is and make it stop.
Dean, no.
Dean?
Dean!
-You see that? You saw it. You saw it. -I saw it. I saw it.
You saw it. We saw it. Oh, my God, we saw it.
Think it was the fish? It smelled a little weird.
You think maybe you're pregnant?
No, I'm not.
It's not that I don't want kids, it's just...
-You know. -I know.
Yeah.
You want kids?
Someday.
Me, too.
I'd give anything for some toothpaste right now.
And some chicken soup and a sad movie.
Come here, lie down. I'll make you feel better.
Do you ever think about what everybody else is doing?
Who's everybody else?
Friends, family,
people out in the world.
We're everybody else now, prom queen.
-What was that? -What the...
Okay there, buddy. Stop, stop. Okay, put it down.
Put the gun down and step away from the vehicle.
Come on, monkey, drop the gun.
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. Put it down!
Come on, little guy. I'll trade you, banana for the gun.
He didn't even take his banana.
You know what?
What the hell? What'd you do that for?
I don't wanna hope anymore.
You're acting like a crazy person. Why did you fire the...
I'm a crazy person?
No, see, crazy is thinking that we can survive
for more than a year on this stupid island.
That's crazy.
We're gonna make a life here, Em. It's gonna be better, I promise.
No noise. I mean, what's so good out there anyway, right?
Life, Dean. Life is what's so good out there.
Our families, our... Everything.
See, you're crazy if you think for one second
that I would actually choose to live like this.
This is not living, this is surviving.
Any luck?
No.
I never said thank you.
For what?
For saving me.
For being there. Here.
Emma...
-Hey! -Hey!
-Hey! -Where is it?
Here, hold this.
Load and shoot, Em.
Pull the trigger, prom queen.
-Over here! -Hey!
-Hey! Hey! Hey! -Hey! Hey! Hey!
Family and friends eagerly await the appearance
of the two young students lost at sea for more than three months.
Emmaline Robinson and Dean McMullen
were rescued yesterday by a helicopter pilot
on a sightseeing tour just off the coast of Venezuela.
-Hey, get down. -I don't think so.
-There's Emma. -Emma!
Hey, Emma!
-Over here! -Emma!
Hey, Emma!
Emma!
I never thought I'd see you again.
-Hey. -Hey.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to check on you, first night back and all.
I was just looking at Facebook and stuff.
-Weird being back, huh? -Yeah.
They said we don't have to go back to school right away.
Yeah, I know.
I think I'm gonna go next week though.
Get back into it.
-Of course you are. -What does that mean?
Nothing, just...
I guess summer's over, huh?
You're talking in code.
My dad told me about your party.
Mom's throwing it, a homecoming thing.
Are you gonna come? Lots of kids from school will be there.
-It'll be fun. -Yeah, fun.
You should probably go.
My mom and dad have been checking on me, like, every 10 minutes.
Sure.
Come to the party, okay?
First of all, thank you guys so much for coming.
It's a special day for us.
I can't imagine the courage it took to survive those days.
I really can't.
But I'm so grateful that you did.
To my girl and to Dean.
-Where is Dean? -Behind you.
I cannot thank you enough.
You kids really are an inspiration to us all.
I mean that. To Emma and to Dean.
To Emma and to Dean.
Hear, hear.
Yeah.
-Thank you for coming. -Thanks so much for having us.
How come you're not over there with everybody else?
I'm not really an everybody-else kind of guy.
Emma is. Always has been.
She's really good at that. People really like her.
Yeah, I can see that.
Did you see any sharks?
It took her, like, two seconds
to become even more popular than before you guys went away.
Yeah, I can see that, too.
-Come on. -Like the memoirs. You know what?
I can't come. Sorry.
They're calling it "The Miracle at Sea."
After more than 100 days stranded on a desert island,
two high school juniors, Emmaline Robinson and Dean McMullen,
have now safely returned to their school,
to their family, to their friends, to their lives,
that they thought they might never see again.
Welcome back.
Excuse us.
I told him I'd think about it.
Oh, my God, Em, you're my hero. You told Stephen...
You are so the bomb.
Anyway, so I'm gonna wear...
Hey, McMullen.
Come on.
Mom wanted me to tell you it was dinnertime.
-Okay. -And I was gonna feed the fish.
-Yeah, go ahead. You can feed them. -Okay.
What's with the dresses?
I don't know.
It's all feeling like...
It's all feeling like someone else.
You know, when you were gone, Mom knew I was there for once.
I didn't have to yell or get in trouble or anything.
At school, all the teachers were nice to me.
Even if it was just for pity, I didn't care.
And now, you're the girl who survived on the island,
going to prom with the f-ing quarterback, for crap's sake.
And I'm back to just being me.
Stacey, you're amazing,
and cool and funny,
and all of these things that I can never be.
And just so you know, I'm not going to prom with Stephen.
Really? Well, who are you gonna go with?
Nobody.
You wanna be my date?
I missed you, Emma.
I missed you, too. I missed you so much.
I saw it, Mom.
I saw the green flash.
It was beautiful.
And...
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry for not being there at your funeral.
And thanks for watching over us.
-What do you think? -It's amazing.
There's a cute hipster boy looking right at you, sis.
-He's looking at you, Em. -Don't think so.
Go.
-You staying in tonight? -Yeah.
You wanna borrow my tux?
Emma, you look amazing.
Stephen's gotta be going crazy.
He's kind of gross anyway, in a smoking-hot kind of way.
Come on, walk with me.
You know, I knew this was always in you.
It just took being stuck in the middle of the ocean to find it, but...
Let's get you a broody boy.
Oh, my dog.
Damn, he looks good.
Go. Be romantic.
I've been trying to come up with the perfect thing to say.
I mean, I...
I didn't even know if I could get in.
Plans are overrated.
I got you something.
-Thank you. -Wanna dance, prom queen?
I'm not the prom queen. I never was.
Never wanted to be.
I'm just a girl.
Wanna dance, girl?
It's kind of pouring.
Is it her admiration for the style and manners of the Regency era?
The number of times she has read Austen's novels?
Or her consuming love for Mr. Darcy?
-Nice cup. -Thanks.
Sexy.
Okay.
-I'll see you for lunch. -Yeah, okay.
Miss Bennet...
This is the best part.
Unbelievable.
Hey, Jane. Ex-boyfriend alert.
Hey, Horseface.
Jimmy, what are you doing here?
Well, I heard you broke up with Greg.
So that means you're free to go bowling tonight.
Jimmy! You know what?
If "no" was unclear last time...
I don't wanna see you again.
I picked you on purpose, Jane Hayes. Thirty plus, clock ticking.
I'm as good as it gets, baby.
A true aficionado of Austen does so much more
than merely read her novels and admire her world from afar.
Excuse me.
She finds her way here
to the world's only immersive Austen experience.
Is that a Chihuahua?
It's a lamb. Shut up. Just trying to hear it.
This looks really cheap.
I've toured the grounds and it's not cheap.
This is high class. This is big time.
Jane, are you really gonna blow your entire life savings on an "Austen experience"?
Now, hold on just a second,
here at Sensuous Travel,
we are not just another run-of-the-mill vacation place.
This is what we call an "LC." A Life-Changer.
You get to play the heroine of your very own Jane Austen story.
Would you like to see some of the staff?
-Yeah. -No.
Now this is Barnaby. He's a vegan.
He enjoys nightly dips in the pond, and he has a pony named Sparkles Pancake.
That is horrendous.
I also heard that people in those days didn't wear underwear.
-That's a lie. -It's not a lie.
Look, every stay at Austenland ends with a real live ball,
as in ballroom, as in happily ever after.
-Do you understand what I'm saying? -Totally.
Jane. So you go on some fancy vacation, then what do you come home to?
Nothing except for an empty bank account.
Why don't you save up for a real life-changer?
-Like what? -Well, like...
That's fine. Maybe come back another time without your friend.
We'll get you squared away.
I think I can figure out some kind of layaway program for you.
Thank you so much.
You guys take care. Thanks for being you. Appreciate you.
Listen, this is my one chance to really live in Austen's world. Okay?
I'm her biggest fan.
-Come on. -No. No.
You used to be a fan.
You are an addict.
You don't have to go in there because I'm packing. It's a mess in there.
You don't wanna go in there.
Janey. It's gotten so much worse.
I love you.
It's a collector's item and that's why I have it.
I have 10,000 a year.
I've changed my mind.
I totally support you going to this place,
because I'm sure that the fantasy will not be as fulfilling as you imagine.
I don't think you know where I'm going.
-We could make a wager on it. -Fine.
If I win, you de-Austen your room.
-Okay. -Fine.
And if you really must go, I made you a little farewell gift.
You did?
Wow.
Which historical era is this supposed to be from?
Hey, I spent three days working on it.
Come here, let's hug it out.
-Thank you. -Okay.
When you get back, just clear this crap out because it's weird.
-It's a hobby. -It's really weird.
Do you need a hand?
Yay, an American.
I can't understand what the natives say.
I think this is where we're supposed to wait, right?
-You're going to the Darcy place, too? -Yes.
I memorized the first three chapters of Pride and Prejudice when I was 13.
What's that?
So why are you going to this place?
Because I'm gonna look great in those wench gowns.
Gosh, I hope they give me a cape, too.
Were we not supposed to come in costume?
Thank goodness you're coming and not her.
I'm Jane, by the way.
Goody. Introductions. Look.
Hi.
I'm Miss Elizabeth Charming.
It's a pretty name, isn't it? I requested it.
Yes, it's very beautiful. I can't wait to pick a name.
How about Miss Pepperpot?
Or Miss Wiggly Wiggins?
Those are nice.
I knew this place would be magical.
They even got us a car from the 1800s.
Thank you so much. I'm Miss Charming.
This way.
Bloody Americans!
Mind the gap.
Sorry. I was told I was supposed to wear a costume.
So was I.
God save the Queen!
Hey, do you think this is the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car?
It's smaller than I expected.
Welcome to the Regency era.
This is just a stop before we go to the big house.
-I am Mrs. Wattlesbrook. -Okay.
Miss Charming, I hope your travel was endurable.
Yes!
-Jane Hayes. -Yes.
And I've been thinking about my pseudonym, and I was thinking Miss Joyful, maybe?
-Yes. -You've already been assigned a name.
Miss Erstwhile.
Miss Erstwhile?
Martin. Take their luggage in.
And get the carriage ready to take us up to the manor.
-Martin. -Ma'am.
-Good luck. -Thanks.
Complete immersion in the Regency era
is the only way to truly appreciate Austen's England.
Wouldn't you say so, Miss Charming?
Righto!
Just to avoid any confusion,
I'd like you to know that we do offer several distinct experiences.
You have paid for the Basic Copper package,
while the other ladies in the party are part of the Platinum Elite package.
Okay.
I'm sure you'll understand there will be some exclusions to your trip.
I mean, I'm just so excited to be here, and I've dreamed about this for so long.
All of my guests will experience romance with one of our actors.
But I must emphasize there is to be no touching
-other than the necessary social graces. -Not a chance.
I also expect all my guests to maintain appropriate manners and conversation
and to eschew all things modern.
Any flagrant disobedience will result in the early termination of your stay.
You don't have to worry about me. I know Austen's books intimately.
A big fire for a hot summer's day.
We need to push up the sisters. There we go.
That's as far as I can go.
It's looking good.
So we have this absolutely delightful chiffon piece.
And I don't know how you feel about lavender.
-I call it lilac. -"Lilac."
This I do think is very magnificent and elegant.
-Salmon! -Salmon. Absolutely.
Kinda washes you out.
Look how skinny I look with my hand behind my back.
-Let's go meet the men. -Okay.
I'm so sorry, my dear, but I'm afraid this carriage only takes two passengers.
-Okay. -Sorry.
Hey, do you think we'll be robbed by some highwaymen?
Martin, hurry up with those bags.
My God, look at those.
Hallelujah.
Do you think those are their real faces?
And for you, Miss Charming, we have our finest Platinum level room.
How old-fashioned.
Miss Erstwhile. If you follow me.
Hey! It's bloody brilliant!
Where are you? We can't dilly-dally.
And you, of course, have one of our loveliest Copper level rooms.
We meet for dinner at 8:00.
I expect you can find your own way to the drawing room.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
With me? Yes.
Jane!
Jane? Come here. All the statues look at you!
Look. It's one of those Mr. Darcy guys.
May I present Miss Elizabeth Charming.
Heiress to the vast Charming fortune.
Top of the evening to you.
And Miss Jane Erstwhile.
An orphan of no fortune, who we've taken in out of the goodness of our hearts.
Colonel Andrews, the second son of the Earl of Denton.
I have never before beheld such beauty...
And class.
What a very pleasant pleasure it is indeed.
And my dear nephew, Henry Nobley.
Goody. There's one for each of us.
And, of course, our honored guest, Lady Amelia Heartwright.
What the H?
I've been so lonely here without other young women to entertain me.
All day, stuck with these men.
And that is my husband.
Do sit down.
I do hope it will not rain on us tomorrow.
It would be so lovely to take a turn around the gardens.
I sure would like you
to turn me upside down in the garden.
Pardon me?
I think Miss Charming just means she loves the outdoors.
-Right. -Bless.
Do you see something in my eye?
I'm afraid I can't see in this low light.
Mr. Nobley.
You really are quite a bloke.
It would appear to be my duty to gaze into your eyes.
I'm a military man, I'd never shirk my duty.
Allow me, Miss Charming.
Yes. Yes, there is something there. Fire.
I say, Miss Charming, you certainly do live up to your name.
Tally-ho!
I do hope you all enjoy the food.
-Have you lost your appetite, Mr. Nobley? -Somewhat.
Something on your mind?
Absolutely nothing's on my mind, thank you.
Prudence, a little bit more of the peacock pâté, when you're ready.
I can't believe I'm really here.
-Jane. -Yeah?
Why don't you try out some of that fancy talk?
Mr. Nobley, I hear there is a ball on our last night.
-Do you enjoy dancing? -Not particularly.
Scandalous.
I am sure you have escorted many a fine lady on to the dance floor.
I would say that manners maketh man.
I look forward to having the pleasure of standing opposite you.
-But dancing is the true hallmark... -You do?
...of a gentilhomme d'honneur.
Pass the sheep's eyeballs, will you?
Traditionally, dancing is a match-making custom.
Yes.
However, it fails unless both partners are equally fond of each other.
You could say the same about any social intercourse.
Intercourse?
Such as talking to someone or having dinner with them.
Society demands that we engage in a social intercourse in order to seem courteous.
Yet, in most cases, such actions are ultimately vulgar.
I really adore conversating.
Do you really believe, Mr. Nobley,
that you can know the worth of a person at a glance?
Can you tell me that within the first few moments
of meeting each person in this room,
you didn't form firm opinions of their character?
Well, it would be a shame if my first impression of you proved correct.
Well, Miss Erstwhile, I for one am so pleased you are here.
Another woman who understands, as I do, the rocky road of love.
Mrs. Wattlesbrook told me of your tragic story.
What?
I try to learn a great deal about my clients so that I can better prepare for their stay.
You have been unlucky in love, shall we say?
We most definitely should say.
At your age, with no husband, no kinder...
I'm sorry.
-The clock is ticking. Tick-tock, tick-tock. -Bugger.
How unfortunate.
Excuse me.
Good duck.
Jane. Jane! Jane. I'm so sorry.
You know, I know how it feels to be treated badly by stupid men.
I really do.
Jane, come on. Give me a hug.
Come on. At least it's not gonna happen at this place.
Besides, you'll feel totally different tomorrow.
Think about all the people in the world that hang themselves.
And then the next day, they feel different, but there's nothing they can do about it.
Don't hang yourself, Jane.
Anyway, if you need anything, just call me. I'm right down the hall.
Well, actually, I'm not right down the hall
because you're in the servants' wing. You're in the creepy tower.
God, sometimes I think about you here at night.
Must be really scary.
-It's okay. -Anyway.
And, Jane, the maid told me that...
FYI, she said don't use the chamber pots.
Apparently the toilets really do flush here,
and they don't know what to do if it's just piled high.
Right.
Of course, he made all his money selling quicklime on the continent.
You can never have enough whitewash, as my grandfather used to say.
Then he contracted dysentery and died.
Tap-tap.
Good morrow, sir. 'Tis I.
Shall we promenade?
I say. Miss Erstwhile, do join us.
Yes, make haste.
I think I'll go find some shade.
Really? How peculiar.
-She's been too much in the sun. -Come, sir.
Your hunting excursion is commencing on the upper paddock at the stable
where you will be assigned an appropriate mount.
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm not spying on you.
I'm afraid you caught me at an unladylike moment.
Mrs. Wattlesbrook will probably rap my knuckles or something.
Tell me about it.
So you hail from the former colonies?
I'm sorry, that's pretty bad. I'm not really here to do the "ye olde" stuff.
I'm probably not supposed to be talking to the servants anyway.
I thought I'd come here and be a total pro at this, but I don't know...
Yeah. Maybe you need a coach or something.
Yeah. I'm definitely not supposed to talk to you.
And yet,
here you are.
That's... I have to...
Where are you?
Miss Erstwhile, there you are.
-Yes, hello. I... -I was just saying to Nobley here
our divine Miss Erstwhile seems to have escaped us.
And let us not see if we cannot find her out...
I was hot so I stopped in here, you know, and then I sat...
I say, Miss Erstwhile, you are tongue-tied today.
What sordid secrets is your mouth trying to hide from us?
-No, no secrets. No. -Do tell me at once.
-I simply must know. -Andrews!
-Can't you see that she's unwell? -No, I'm fine. Thank you...
Unwell? Perhaps you have a touch of the vapors? Or mange?
Either way, bell jar on the tummy. Sucks out all the vicious vapors.
-And leeches on the ankles... -Andrews, shut up.
What?
Hi. Ladies and gents, please take notice!
I've just got the schedule,
and look, it says we get to go hunting on horseback.
Can you believe it? Real horses and real guns!
Release the hounds!
Tally-ho. A-hunting we will go.
The British are coming. The British are coming!
-Shall we go? -Shall we?
Hey, stable boy. You're way too slow! Come on!
I've never shot a hunting rifle before.
Now, the whole thing with the gun, darling, is that you have to cock it.
Just hold the barrel. There.
And then gently pull the trigger.
Have you ever fired a loaded weapon before?
Actually, I think you might be quite impressed by my...
-Big cock. -...skills.
I will be.
-Just a little closer there. -Yeah, I think I get the basics.
Ready, ladies?
Face down range. Load. And make ready.
And, pull!
Fly in my eye.
My... Miss Erstwhile. What a talented little nut you are.
Yeah.
I guess I get the basics of it.
I didn't think we were really supposed to kill them.
What are we supposed to eat for dinner?
Anyone for pheasant? Me.
Of course, all these horses are thoroughbreds.
They come from the local stud. Well, I'm too busy, you see.
There's something wrong with the horse.
Crap Copper package.
Little bit tight. Have to give you a rub down tonight.
Excuse me?
-The horse. -Right, sorry.
There we go.
Thank you.
-I'll be back in a crack with a new horse. -Okay.
Hi.
-Did that stable boy abandon you? -No, he's coming right back.
Well, I wasn't raised to leave a woman alone in the woods.
I'm really... I'm fine.
Well, there's...
-All right, come on. Get up. -Both of us on the one horse?
I don't know if that's gonna really work for me...
-Right, are you ready? One, two, three. -No, no.
Okay.
We're not gonna be able to outrun the storm unless you straddle the horse.
Straddle... Not possible in this rig. Sorry.
-Get forward. Forward. That's it, more. -Forward? Okay. Well...
Take the reins.
Now, anyone who can shoot a gun like that can ride a horse.
Come on.
Do you have me?
I've got you fine. Thank you.
Jane.
-Come here. -I know, but it's a little hard...
-No, your leg, your leg. No. -Yeah, okay.
-Thank you. -Jane.
What the hell do you think you were doing leaving her alone like that?
I'm sorry, I was coming.
No, I was fine, actually, Mr. Nobley.
There you are, Mr. Nobley. I was about to arouse a search party.
Miss Erstwhile. What ghastly thing happened to you?
I think I'm just gonna go powder my nose.
Everyone, please assemble in the drawing room for this evening's whist drive.
Partners will be assigned according to ability and package status.
I do believe I start this one, do I not?
I'm just so happy. I...
See if you can beat that.
Well, there's a card.
A proper lady does not doodle the evening away, Miss Erstwhile.
You're looking well, Mr. Nobley.
The rain refreshed your spirits, did it?
Hardly.
I say, who needs the outdoors when you ladies are such a breath of fresh air?
Colonel, you really are a saucy monkey.
Miss Erstwhile, what's that earthy smell about you?
Is it perfume?
I'm not wearing any perfume.
Must be your essence.
Must be your essence. Colonel. Tremendous play. I didn't see that one.
No, no one ever does.
It's my sneaky maneuver I picked up in the Punjab.
Exotic!
My, Miss Charming, what beauteous skin you possess.
Reawy?
Well, that's because late at night when I'm all alone,
I put my face in the fire.
Really?
It's like a porcelain plate.
It's like being in a kiln.
Wake up and suddenly you're in love
Sorry. I didn't mean to bother you if you're in the middle of something or...
-You are a little lost? -No.
I was just walking around, and then I heard music and so...
Quick. Get in before Wattlesbrook confiscates this thing.
Let's hope you're not her spy.
-Mrs. Wattlesbrook? -Yeah.
She made me sign half a dozen proper behavior agreements...
Right.
Swear to keep any modern contraption out of sight of the guests.
Right.
Including you, Miss Erstwhile.
I'm not a spy. I swear.
And you don't have to call me Miss Erstwhile. It's Jane.
Martin.
I am so sorry about this afternoon.
No, no. Don't be. Don't even worry about it.
I would have been absolutely fine if it weren't for Prince Valiant showing up.
The actors are paid to be valiant. Right.
They have some "Most Valiant Player of the Month" award.
Still, it's nice to have a little break from them.
Do you mind if I turn back on your music?
No, of course not.
You're a real easy listening kinda guy, huh?
Yeah. It relaxes me.
Yeah. The easier... The easier, the better.
Here it comes.
I used to think that love was just a fairy tale
You're a really great singer.
You've got really great taste in gowns.
You make it a little hard for me to take myself seriously in this getup.
Where are you in there? There you are, yeah.
Do you slow dance?
Sure.
Suddenly life has new meaning to me
I don't remember Wattlesbrook teaching us that move.
Yeah, neither will those posh boys up at the house.
I almost forgot about it.
Do you have another girl hidden around here somewhere?
Yeah.
What was that?
You don't wanna scare her.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.
You put all the girls at ease?
Only the wild ones.
We almost missed it.
Is this horse about to have a baby right here?
I've never seen anything being born.
-Go get me some straw. -Wait a second.
Are you gonna have to stick your hands up in and flip it or something?
-Jane, just go get her some straw. -Yeah, all right.
Breathe, you can do this.
Straw. Get it. Yeah.
I found some!
Okay. Thanks, Jane.
My God, what's that?
-Jane. -I'm coming right now.
Get the straw, Jane!
Push! Push! Push!
That's it...
Oh, my... Sparkle.
I found it!
Jane, it's beautiful.
Got the straw.
Oh, my gosh!
It's the miracle of birth.
There you go. Up you get, buddy.
Run free, little Sparkle.
Prince Valiant couldn't do that.
No.
That was amazing, though. That was really amazing.
I should probably get going.
You got...
Might not want that.
Can I give you something first?
Just...
Wanted to do that for a while.
Good night, Jane Erstwhile.
Good night.
"She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley,
and some from her own heart."
I have one, too.
Mr. Darcy said to Jane,
"Jane, listen. Listen right now.
"If you were to sleep with me tonight,
"I would actually speak to you the next day,
"unlike any man that you will meet 100 years from now."
Please. Please shut your hole.
Men and women wouldn't even touch before marriage,
let alone be alone in the same room together.
I don't think he would ever say something like that, and he was a gentleman.
Why are we sewing again?
I guess this is how women must have spent a lot of their time.
Well, if the men don't come back from hunting soon,
I'm gonna ask for a refund.
What about you, Miss Erstwhile? Are you enjoying yourself?
It is a shame we are so awkwardly grouped.
Two gentlemen and three ladies,
leaving you always to bring up the rear alone.
If you'll excuse me, I think I'm gonna go to the library for a little while.
Jane.
I'm reading.
You're not really allowed to read down on the sluice gate. Okay?
You know, this is off-limits, okay? This is...
This is really very dangerous down here. Okay?
Anything could happen.
I mean, I don't have to be reading.
I just...
Martin, come on.
I'll go crazy if I have to sit up in that house all afternoon.
You love it up there.
All those guys paid to adore you.
Come on, check out the butler. He's got a 14-pack.
-You're right, I'm gonna go find him. -Yeah?
You win.
Martin, the birds.
I'll see you later?
Yeah. I just gotta put away a few fake birds. Maybe see you at the stables?
Okay.
Awful as spread, is this one.
But really. Never before...
I'm gonna need a new inkwell in my room.
-Are you? -Yeah, it's empty.
Really?
And what are you going to pen while you're there?
Maybe a little journal of your time and experiences?
-Maybe the Declaration of Independence. -Really?
Sumptuous beans. My favorite.
Yummy.
How does one go about eating a fish this big?
They're so delicious!
Baked, stewed.
Refried.
Marvelous.
Everyone. I have great news.
Captain George East has just arrived from the West Indies.
Good morning, ladies.
You're beautiful.
I hear you were just made captain.
Do tell us the story.
-Yes, we like stories. Please do. -Can't wait.
I were raised on the sea. Ferrying goods between the islands.
But when Napoleon struck, I joined arms with me British brothers.
Bravi, bravi.
Within months I were first mate,
and then came my moment of destiny.
Imagine one lone British frigate, surrounded by four French war crafts,
cap'n dead on the deck.
-"Surrender," came the cry. -Anyone buying this?
"Never," said I.
Did you die?
Now I were tempted to surrender, but I had to hearten me men.
"Death first."
But surely there could be no dishonor in surrender
with your captain dead and your men so outnumbered?
When my seaman's heart tell me what to do,
I do not fear to follow through.
That rhymes. That rhymes.
But right now,
my seaman's heart bid me do thusly.
You are a most sensual creature.
Thank you.
I say. Steady on, Captain.
This is absurd.
Watch out, Nobley.
No, don't get up too quickly, George.
I believe the ladies are needed in the drawing room with Mrs. Wattlesbrook.
Lizzie darling.
I'll be along shortly.
I'm your humble servant, My Lady.
Ladies, please join me in the parlor
for my lecture series on bonnets, bosoms and vices.
-Hi. -Hey.
What do we have planned today?
What, you couldn't find anyone else to flirt with today?
I saw you parading around with those actors.
I thought you weren't into that stuff.
Maybe I am.
Well, I've never really been able to respect the kind of women that come here.
So I guess I was fooling myself that you weren't one of them.
What, so are you breaking up with me?
Breaking up?
I didn't realize we were going steady.
No, sorry, I didn't mean it.
If I was sane when I shot you, I would have aimed for your head.
Did you see that?
That was amazing, George.
I mean, really beautiful acting.
I had to drink human breast milk supplements to get arms that big.
I mean...
Must be what makes your hair so shiny.
Can I use your power socket?
But you'll have to turn off the telly. George, do you mind?
Well, I...
-Well, we'll watch it later. -Okay.
Welcome to the Pleasure Dome.
-Thank you. -Hey, George.
-Hey, Martin. You good? -Yeah.
Welcome back, eh.
How are the ladies treating you this year?
Well, I can't complain.
I can't complain.
You really let yourself go.
What? Really? What?
Don't. Leave the boy alone.
How is life in the stables?
My horses are less trouble than women.
What do you guys think of that girl, Jane?
-What's its name? -You know, Miss...
Erstwhile.
Yeah, I could slap that between a bun.
Well, she's a bit peculiar.
-She's hot. -She's all right.
Perfect, Lady Heartwright. Perfect.
I have no words to describe it.
I say.
I would die enraptured to hear you play, Miss Erstwhile.
No, not tonight, not tonight.
-Go on, go on. -Please.
Miss Erstwhile, I insist.
Okay.
-Allow me. -Thank you.
I only really know one song.
-Play that one then. -Not surprising.
So I'll just play that.
It's getting hot in here
So take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot
I'm gonna take my clothes off
I never.
I think I will retire early.
That was frigging awesome.
Where are you going?
Sorry. Sorry. I didn't know
I became a ninja when startled in a strange place.
My father, if he were alive, would die of shame.
And here was I thinking that any father would be
delighted to have a ninja as a daughter.
Excuse me.
-Miss Erstwhile. -Yes.
I don't know if you realize that
it's not proper in this particular time, or any time,
for a lady to be alone after dark...
-Okay. -Let alone cavorting with the servants...
Cavort?
When doing so might lead to...
Did you just say "cavort"?
There's just something about that guy I really don't...
Aren't you all righteous concern, Mr. Nobley?
Thank goodness you've saved me from sullying myself with the help.
Don't be so ridiculous.
Insufferable.
Well, good evening, Miss Erstwhile.
Good evening, Mr. Wattlesbrook.
Still awake, are you? Up to some mischief, I hope.
Just needed some fresh air. If you'll excuse me.
No, no, stay a moment.
We might engage in a private game of whist.
That's a four-person game.
We could be partners.
Little wink-wink, little nudge-nudge, under the table.
I think I should go to bed now.
-Precisely my point. -No.
This is so not Regency appropriate!
We can make it part of the game. Do a little role play.
Get off of me. Get off of me!
Miss Erstwhile?
Are you all right?
Whatever is the matter? I didn't have time to locate my breeches.
Why, Mr. Wattlesbrook, not again.
Little slag attacked me!
Well, obviously. She is a ninja.
Come here.
I have to tell you, the lads are not gonna cover up for you anymore. I promise you.
Just don't tell the missus!
Well, I won't tell the missus, but...
-I'll escort you to your room. -I'm okay now.
Thank you. I just...
As long as there aren't any other Mr. Wattlesbrooks lurking around.
I cannot give Andrews a glowing reference,
though I do believe you could take him down.
Miss Erstwhile, are you sure there's nothing more I can do for you?
I'm fine.
I should just go to bed.
Good night.
Apparently I bought the cheap package.
-The cheap package? You kidding me? -No.
I don't even think my character gets the "happily ever after" storyline.
I am going to kill that travel agent.
I'm so mad I wasted all my money.
Okay, enough is enough.
You just need to come home and buy your Tercel back.
Molly, I'm kind of a mess, aren't I?
That's an understatement.
I wanna get over all of this stuff,
but if I leave now, I'll always wonder "What if?"
So, what are you gonna do?
I'm going to take charge of my story.
An Austen heroine gets engaged by the end of the book,
so that is what I'm going to do.
Why don't you go for Captain East?
Look how hot he is.
And he's a soap star.
Captain East?
Okay. East it is.
But can you help me, please?
I mean, this is not gonna work.
I've prepared my entire life for this very moment.
Someone's coming, hurry up.
Heartwright had millions of them.
She's as dumb as a light post. She'll never notice.
Oh, my God.
Look at this one.
I love stealing things from her.
Watch my mouth.
Blast.
-Blast. -Good. Good.
Bloody Americans.
Bloody Americans.
You got it. You are the queen.
Really?
...the family name's not Nobley at all,
and that's a French affectation. In fact, it's Knobble.
Knobble, just Knobble.
You can tell by the way he uses his chalk that he's a ladies' man.
He doesn't have time for that kind of conversation.
Don't mind me.
It's unusual sometimes, but he is rather shy.
Do you think he hears us?
He doesn't look over and yet his expressions and mannerisms
are a bit too determined, don't you think?
Right you are, Miss Erstwhile.
'Course I hear you.
Have to be deaf not to the way you lot are prattling on.
I say, Nobley, you are being awfully tedious today.
Good one.
You know, alone with the chaps, he's really quite a pleasant fellow.
-Really? -Yes.
No, baby.
My little kumquat. You made yourself all wet.
Allow me.
Look at you, all moist.
Couldn't you just use a handkerchief?
Captain.
Perhaps I don't find the conversation of women to be
stimulating.
I just can't imagine why you're still single.
Don't see a ring on your finger.
-Nobley. -No, no, no, it's all right.
I asked for it.
I am single because, apparently, the only good men are fictional.
Touché.
And you think that there's any good women out there?
No, no, no.
They profess honesty and fidelity,
and while you're away lecturing in Switzerland,
they run off to Brazil with your mate!
Get on with the game, you old windbag!
Someone departing?
That's my trunk.
I have discovered an unmentionable amongst your things.
Now I believe I made it perfectly clear about the rules, Miss Erstwhile.
We thank you for your stay, but I regret that your actions have forced me to cut it short.
-What? -First, that horrid little song and now this.
You're really gonna kick me out?
I'm afraid it is time for you to leave.
Go get 'em, Charming.
I'm so sorry, Jane.
If you would be so kind as to step on to the cart.
Mrs. Wattlesbrook.
Please, wait.
This is all my fault.
The modern contraption is mine.
I did not realize I had it until I first arrived.
And I was so distressed,
Miss Erstwhile kindly offered to keep it for me
where I would not have to look upon the eyesore...
Well,
I see.
So, apparently this appears to be an accident,
and I think the best thing is we should pretend like it never happened.
Lady Heartwright, I do so hope that you will continue to honor us with your presence.
Yes. Of course.
Thank you.
I forbid you to leave, ever, Miss Erstwhile.
We were just getting to know each other.
Miss Erstwhile.
Yeah. Hi.
Thank you for back there with Mrs. Wattlesbrook.
It was a pleasure to save you.
And, please, you must call me Amelia.
Really?
Make haste.
Quickly.
Amelia?
Dear Jane, now that we are bosom sisters, I can at last confide in someone.
Janey,
last year, at the ball,
Georgie...
George East and I
became engaged.
It is true.
But alas, he was a poor sailor,
and my father broke off the engagement without my assent.
If I try to explain this to him now,
George will think I only want him back because he has become a wealthy captain.
What am I to do?
I sort of thought you were into Nobley, or is that not...
No, no, no!
Dear Jane, I know you will help me find a way to be alone with Captain East.
I don't really know what I could do.
It pained me to be so dishonest with Mrs. Wattlesbrook back there.
But so long as you
are my dearest friend,
I'll keep your secret.
Or should I say secrets?
Farewell, bosom sister.
You know, I think being creative is a waste of time and money.
Well, I love ribbons and feathers and colors.
Another blue tit, please, Miss Charming.
All right, but don't copy everything I do.
I'll try.
We're not worthy, Mrs. Wattlesbrook.
Their hearts will positively burst from the rapture.
I have something of the utmost urgency to report.
Who's game for a bit of amusement?
Me! Me! I'm so bored.
Well, well, my cupcake,
Mrs. Wattlesbrook has only gone and surpassed herself
and has completed a brilliant theatrical.
You don't look like you could read or write.
It's just a trifle.
Now, there are six parts.
Three sets of lovers.
And I thought, give us something to pass the time until the ball,
we could rehearse it and perform it
for our illustrious and distinguished authoress.
Now are there any questions?
-No. -No what?
You can't make me do a play. It's humiliating.
That's not a question. It's out of the question, I'm afraid.
I've got a question.
Who gets to pick the lovers?
Well, I'm thinking maybe ladies' choice.
You know, maybe alphabetically.
Goody, goody.
Eeny, meeny, miny... You!
And you, Miss Erstwhile?
Pick wisely, Jane.
I guess Mr. Nobley.
-Sorry. Sorry. -That's okay.
Sorry.
Okay, since we have to spend so much time rehearsing this thing,
let's just... Let's try not to annoy each other.
You don't annoy me.
You make me nervous.
So, are you enjoying your stay?
Really? We're making small talk now?
Okay.
Well, the house is amazing, but it's kind of like a corset.
-I like the way it looks, but it's just... -Hard to relax in it.
Yes, exactly.
But there is so much to love here.
I mean, the civility.
The manners.
The grandeur, you know.
Simplicity.
The men.
The women.
The paintings. They're really...
-Yes, you are an artist. -No, no, no.
The thing is, those aren't real. They're just stupid sketches.
-Who's that? -Exactly.
I'm sorry. They're not all like that.
No, no. It's a...
It's a fair likeness. No apologies needed.
It is curious, however,
that there are more of me than anyone else.
I guess I've been trying to figure you out without much luck.
Surely you've come to some conclusions.
You're the resident Mr. Darcy.
Come on, you're every girl's fantasy.
So I'm your fantasy?
You play your character very well.
Right.
-Shall we rehearse, then? -Yes.
Roger.
Are they acting?
I don't know what's real or what's not anymore.
-I mean, what if she actually is... -In love with him?
Well, don't you think it's possible to confuse truth with fantasy?
I mean, what's gonna happen when the theatrical is over?
Well, it's a dangerous kind of game to play.
Don't you think, in their case anyway, those feelings that,
you know, that they can run deeper and...
Oh, my.
If you'd have asked me a week ago, I'd have said no.
-Miss Erstwhile. -Yes.
You're shivering.
Thank you.
Ladies, remember to wear your corsets nice and tight.
-Jane, hey. -Martin.
Where are the other guests?
In their private whist lesson.
It's part of the Platinum package.
I can't say that I miss that perk.
Stage curtain.
Right. Right.
I'll let you get to it, then.
I'm sorry.
I am Aphrodite, the goddess.
Often fickle in my large arse.
-Largesse. -Largesse.
I see some mortals there.
Yes, two in love, yet in despair.
Prithee, fair maid. Have thou seen my lost lamb?
Nay. Perhaps you should listen for its bleat.
Go not to Athens, I pray thee, or my heart will truly break.
-In faith and troth, I have no time to love... -Can't hear you.
-No, no, no, louder. -What?
-Louder. -Speak up!
In faith and troth, I have no time to love a lady. War is my mistress.
-Line? -I write poems of love.
I write poems of love that no fair maid hears.
And I am shedding tears that fall to the ground
but do not maketh a sound like the land...
You're rubbish. Get off the stage, you wanker.
Really!
Philistines!
I shall make everything all righty
because I am the beautiful Aphrodite.
Can I pray thee, stranger,
make me thy wife.
I seek no marriage but the cleavage...
Cleaving of my sword on mine enemy's flesh.
Then I shall die this day.
Thou cur.
You break this lady's heart, I will break your head.
-Get an ice pack. -Sorry.
Sorry.
-Get on with it. -Sorry.
What a... I've fallen upon my sword.
Is that blood upon your breast?
Alas, I am for the grave.
Then let me hold you as long as your breath lasts.
It's as if I have never known you before this moment.
And nought else matters in this world but you
and how my heart beats for you.
I love you.
You need to die, Nobley.
Sorry. Sorry.
No, we are all dead.
No!
And they all died forever.
All dead forever.
Shut up, Fartwright.
Bravo. Bravo!
Mrs. Wattlesbrook, you're a genius.
Such talent.
Lady Heartwright, you make such a beautiful corpse.
You!
You know, I was aiming for your cans, but they're such a small target.
I'll never see again.
It's okay, my baby.
Let's get out of here. Come on.
Come on.
This way.
Why are we running?
Because man and woman should never be alone unless they are in motion.
And what do the rules of etiquette say about being alone in your bedroom?
Right.
I should probably let you go before one of us gets into trouble.
I really had so much fun tonight.
So did I.
Miss Erstwhile?
Yes, Mr. Nobley?
Tomorrow evening...
Can I reserve the first two dances with you?
Yes, Mr. Nobley.
Miss Erstwhile, will you let me back in a moment?
When I look at you, I feel
certain of something.
-Guess what? -What?
I'm wearing my favorite pair of satin pink pantaloons just in case.
-Oh, my God. -Look at that.
We're gonna be the prettiest girls at the ball.
Have fun tonight, Amelia.
You look so beautiful.
-Piratey. -But like a beautiful pirate.
It's infected.
-I'm so sorry. -Maybe we should go.
-Ship's ahoy. -Baby?
It's okay, you look fine.
It looks terrible.
That does not look good.
I was hoping to dance with a goddess tonight.
Lordy.
Smother me in butter and drop me in a saucepan.
There she is. My Venus de Milo.
-Colonel Andrews. -Miss Charming.
Tally-ho.
I can't wait to see your bedroom.
-Hi. -Hey.
Wow, you look... You look amazing.
Thank you. You look very nice, too.
Topshop.
Where are all these people from?
She's got everyone here, it's the gardener, the maids, the servants.
That guy over there, that's the taxidermist.
He's particularly creepy.
-How is the baby horse? -He's good.
Yeah. He's talking and all that.
-Yeah. He was asking about you. -Really?
Yeah. He said, "Where's Straw Girl?"
I made an impression, I'm sure.
Jane, I'm really into you.
And if you wanna get out of here, I mean...
Miss Erstwhile?
Shall we?
-Shall we? -Yes.
-You're stunning. -Really?
You all right?
I'm fine. And you? Are you having fun?
I'm taking an inordinate amount of pleasure from this evening.
You're so light on your feet, you look like a nutcracker.
But none of it from the ball.
I think you just complimented me.
Jane, I need to tell you something.
I'm not meant to say or do these things,
my aunt would kill me, but...
You are my sun and my moon.
My earth and my stars.
Marry me.
Marry you? Oh, my God, of course I will.
Oh, God, I love you. I love you.
You make me the happiest man alive, dear Amelia,
if you'd be my wife.
George.
Jane. Remember our first night?
Something about bad first impressions comes to mind.
I know your opinion of me was horrible.
I was horrible.
I was nervous.
I felt out of place and I certainly didn't intend on falling in love, but...
I have.
I can't imagine leaving this place without you.
Please, tell me if I have any hope.
I didn't realize...
This is how I'd feel at this part.
Feel what?
You were right, this is a dangerous kind of game.
I don't wanna play anymore.
What do you want?
I want something real.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hey.
-Do you still wanna get out of here? -Yeah.
-Sorry. -Good night, Your Majesty.
I didn't think I was touching you inappropriately.
Well, you did. And if we're to be together,
you must never ever do anything like that ever again,
if we're to be together.
Even Prudence is getting some.
-Are you ready? -Yes.
So Wattlesbrook got Nobley to propose to me tonight.
-Yeah. Classic. -Yup.
Is that when you walked out? Just...
Man, what a tart.
I have to admit his character was pretty dreamy.
Yeah.
I wouldn't marry him.
Mainly because he's got bad knees.
-Bad knees? -Did he mention his knees?
I'm an even bigger nerd than I thought, though.
I mean, there were actual moments
when I really did believe it was real.
Don't feel bad. I mean, Wattlesbrook hires the best actors around.
Yeah.
And...
Some of her clients, you know, aren't half bad either.
I'm so glad you're outside of the fantasy.
Makes it easier to walk away from it all.
You know my flight leaves tomorrow, but I could see if I could change it.
Stay a few extra days in London.
That's an offer I... I'm not gonna refuse.
I fancy seeing you in...
I don't know, some trousers or...
Do you wear anything less 1800s, ever?
Do you?
Yeah, I do the short shorts.
Please bring soiled petticoats and undergarments...
-Jane. -Lizzie.
Are you off?
I'm off. I'm packing up.
Hey, you know, I wanted to say just...
Thanks for everything.
And I made this for you.
All the sewing we did.
That's beautiful.
I think she's way prettier than me, don't you think?
That's really great needlepoint.
So what are you gonna do now?
I thought I would stay on
and check out all the new recruits.
You know, make sure that
all of them know that Colonel Andrews is taken.
And then I thought I would ask Miss Wattlesbrook
if I can buy the place.
-You should. -I know. I think I should.
Lizzie, you know, I think...
I think that Colonel Andrews...
I think he... That he might be...
Perfect for you.
Jane, thank you.
I was so afraid you were gonna say you thought he was gay.
Farewell.
God, that was the best time so far.
Except for the eye gouging.
-You're not British? -Yeah, I know, right?
Well, that's what two years of private drama tutoring will get you.
You ended up with Nobley, right?
He was such a bore, but, you know...
He did a good job of being into you.
He asked me to pretend your cell phone was mine.
It's so sad when the trip is over, but, frankly, I am dying for a massage.
My husband's old.
Very old.
And I trust you discovered rewarding romance with one of the gentlemen?
Actually, there was someone,
but not Mr. Nobley, as you may have intended.
My dear, Henry was never meant for you.
No, his job was to take care of Lady Heartwright
until George East finished his little show.
No, Martin was scripted for you right from the very beginning.
No, but he's...
Martin's a servant.
Well, you've seen my servants.
I had to take him out just for a little while because things were
steaming up.
But I had every confidence that he could woo you back.
And your timing was very fortunate.
Most of the ladies just get a litter of kittens.
The foal is the showstopper.
The foal?
I trust you would like to be on your way, Jane?
-More than ever. -Are you upset?
No, not at all.
And please don't take it personally when I shut you down.
Shut me down?
I wasn't the first guest Mr. Wattlesbrook assaulted, was I?
I should be able to find other complaints in no time.
But...
Wow, Nobley, eh?
Tied your cravat just a wee bit too tight, didn't you?
To be honest, I can't believe you didn't get Jane.
I mean, she was... She was anyone's.
Mad dog over there.
Colonel Andrews speaking. Yes.
Yes, no. I'll tell him right away. Yes.
Yes. Yes, you have a good day. Of course. Bye-bye.
Martin, that was the old girl back at the house.
Appears you're still on the clock.
You're to go to the airport and smooth some ruffled feathers pronto.
No rest for the gorgeous.
Hi. No luggage. No.
This is a passenger announcement.
Can Jane Erstwhile please report to the information desk?
That's Jane Erstwhile to the information desk.
-Hi, I think they... -Jane. Hey.
I'm really sorry you didn't know, okay?
I'd still like to spend the night together. Yeah?
You are an actor!
Hey. Hey, but...
But you're desperately in love with me anyway?
And these sudden passionate feelings that sent you running after me
have nothing to do with Mrs. Wattlesbrook's fear
that I'm gonna report her delinquent husband?
-Of course not. Okay? -Right.
I know it all seems shady, but romances have bloomed on stonier ground.
Did Wattlesbrook write that line? Because we know you didn't.
-Okay, she wrote the line. Okay? -Right.
But I'm the one standing here saying it.
Jane!
Jolly good, the prefect's here to save the day.
You can't believe anything he's said.
I've only just realized now that Martin was assigned to you.
I know. I... Yeah.
She knows, so...
So, what are you doing here?
It's just that I don't think you understand that I'm not what you think I am.
-I have fallen for you. -Right.
My aunt was an actor, sure.
She's an odd woman, I know, but she was desperate.
What I'm saying is that your first week at the manor was my first week, too.
I'm not an actor.
Don't listen to him, Janey.
Don't call me Janey! You were paid to kiss me.
As far as you are concerned, I am Miss Erstwhile.
I mean, it's so embarrassing.
What, do you keep a supply of pregnant horses
just laying around or something?
-What? -You're not a vet!
I did a biology class at school.
Come on, you were acting, too.
Look, before you go and make your report,
you should know, gorgeous,
that what we had was real.
No, you didn't. What we had was real. Didn't we?
Surely you felt it seeping through all these costumes and pretense?
He's still acting. It's all part of his act. See the costume? He's an actor.
You're just jealous, aren't you?
Because my aunt would rather bring in a complete novice than move some
Kiwi actor up to the big house.
You're not British either?
-It's part of the Commonwealth. -Couldn't you get a job on The Hobbit?
That's it, Shakespeare.
No!
You guys.
Just... Don't actually, actually strangle him.
Okay. All right, all right.
Take that, England.
Careful of my shirt!
That's my foot!
Okay, okay. No, no, no. I'm...
Stop! No.
No! It is over. I am done with all of this!
That felt good. I should have done that a long time ago.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Did you hear that, England?
I am officially over it!
Southwest Airlines flight SA435 now boarding at Gate 20.
That's my cue to exit.
Boys,
it has been a pleasure.
Thank you for that and I'm sorry.
Look, Jane, Jane, Jane, wait, wait. Hey, I never lied to you.
It doesn't even matter that you weren't real.
You were perfect. Thank you.
Somewhere there's a light
That meets a shoreless tide
But I guess I'm resigned
To never seeing mine
I never lied
All these teenage dreams
Put them all aside
They hurt like kryptonite
And you lost a piece of me
-You're back? -Hello to you, too.
-I'm coming over. -All right, I'll see you in a minute.
That was quick. Come on in.
Do you want some tea?
Love a cup, thank you.
What are you doing here?
Well...
You left this.
Thanks.
You could've mailed it.
I...
I could have.
You're right.
What was I thinking?
Wait a minute. Hey.
You know, I'm not gonna report your aunt.
So it was a little overkill to send you all the way here.
She didn't send me.
Mr. Nobley, or whoever you actually are.
My name is Henry.
It's Henry Nobley.
I'm a history professor.
That's really nice.
I used to think my aunt's profession was somewhat grotesque,
but the truth is that I enjoyed stepping into history.
The idea of a simpler world where
love is straightforward and lasting.
I believe we have that in common.
But all of this is secondary to the fact that I am completely mad about you.
All right. Well you
may have been mad about Miss Erstwhile, but...
You don't even know me. I...
You are Miss Erstwhile.
I saw you in the theatrical. You were horrifying.
Wait a minute. You were horrifying. I was...
-I wasn't great. -My point exactly.
Neither one of us are capable of pretending.
Nobley, I just don't think this is a...
The night of the ball, you said you wanted something real.
I'd like to believe that I am real.
Is it possible that
someone like me can make you happy?
Will you let me try?
No. See, people don't do this.
I mean, this is my fantasy. This isn't...
Have you stopped to consider that you might have this all backward?
Jane...
You are my fantasy.
Tally-ho. Tally-ho.
Welcome to Austenland.
Hello, everybody. Enjoy yourselves.
Oh, my goodness. Hello.
Move, move, move! Movey, move!
Honey, honey. No touchy, no touchy.
Georgie. Georgie!
Get off it.
I love you, Captain! Georgie!
That's a very sexy bonnet.
Knob off.
A warm kebab for 2 o'clock, please.
WESTIN HOTEL, ROOM 607
What do you have to say about the missile test results?
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE UNDERCOVER VEHICLE
The estimates you gave us they're off by over two kilometers.
RUSSIAN ARMS BROKER YURI
Our technicians weren't present for the test.
Smaller arms and the older missiles are not the problem.
We worry…
-What's going on here all of a sudden? -Man, the consulate is off today too.
Get this thing to work so I can hear clearly.
NIS BERLIN STATION
- Raise the volume. - Hold on, please.
Hey, it's not time for contract yet.
Did you get a close-up of his face?
We don't see a match.
CIA, MI6, no match whatsoever.
Haven't seen a ghost in a while.
If you don't purchase the new missiles, We'll not provide the additional weapons.
ANTI-IMPERIALISM ARAB LEAGUE ASIM
And then we ran another test with North Korean technicians.
What do you say?
I said make it louder!
Let's talk another time.
My approach is let's keep going.
NORTH KOREAN EMBASSY IN BERLIN SECRET CORRESPONDENCE ROOM
I don't make the decisions. I only follow orders.
Yeah, but you have a young leader now.
You must be more flexible, comrade.
Flexible?
Your claim to oppose imperialism, but negotiating with this imperialistic logic?
Our terms are non-negotiable.
NORTH KOREAN AMBASSADOR IN BERLIN RI HAK-SU
Excuse me.
What's the problem with you two?
You came to sign the contract, not negotiate.
Let us--
This is the most reasonable deal that I've seen in years.
You're both being stubborn.
-You're slaves to the-- -I can not match his price in dollars!
Then what about Euros?
I can speak to him about this at least.
Okay, helpers. Get ready.
First, you sign the paper. Then you get the money.
The transfer first.
Action. Action!
CREDIT TRANSFERRING
Okay.
Yeah. Cut!
The contract is over. Helpers, get out now.
This is the Mossad!
Our clean up squad is here in ten minutes.
ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE AGENCY MOSSAD DAGAN
Don't make this any worse than it already is.
We can end this here.
We've got no interest in your weapon's deal.
We're only here for Russian broker and the Arab.
You've got plenty of other clients to do business with.
Target is on the roof.
Move underground to the hallway on the other side.
Distance from target…
Let's not make a scene.
Do they teach you to aim at the temple in the South?
I just need to know the transaction history and the exchanged items.
I turn my head, and you'll miss.
Fine, but I need you to come with me first.
How badly did you mess up
to cause a stir at the consulate, the embassy, and the Blue House?
You know there's no way around open fire involving national intelligence.
Now, tell me what I can report back to the Blue House.
-We have a report on the incident… -Did you record the conversation?
Does it say what's being exchanged?
You can't confirm what's on that contract.
There's no record of the dialogue.
What exactly were you recording?
I had the gun right in front of me. What more evidence…
And our agent busted his back because of that commie.
We are at a disadvantage given the international law.
Threat with no clear evidence an outburst and to say that North Korea--
Why are you putting that blame on us?
What the hell.
That North Korean agent suspect, I hear there's no record of him?
Are we sure he's from the North?
Who's going to take responsibility for this mess and how?
I asked, who and how.
Shit
Mr. Kang and his Berlin team,
Get ready to disband.
Investigator, sir.
How does disbanding solve this problem?
There were teams from other countries on the site.
Other countries?
Hand it to me.
What we are trying to uncover is not an arms exchange deal.
Kim Jong-il moved funds from Europe to Macau right before he died.
We are after this secret account that holds four billion dollars.
Once we locate that account,
we can get the information on aids from other countries to North Korea.
You are not one to make mistakes. What happened?
Yuri was an arms broker already on the American radar.
It would've been easy for South Korea to track him.
Asim is anti-American, yet it was Israeli intelligence that showed up.
One of the three leaked.
Either the Russian sold it to the Israeli,
or the Arab was a double spy for Mossad. If neither…
It would be one of us.
Hey, Pyo Jong-sung…
Get your head on straight.
Jong-sung…
listen to me carefully.
Do you know who's coming from Pyongyang as we speak?
Dong Myung-soo is on his way.
Why would they send him when you are already out here?
Pyongyang doesn't trust us.
All the higher ranks are under special surveillance since Kim Jong-un stepped up.
Even Republic's hero like you
is under watch now.
-You better watch out, or else-- -Comrade ambassador…
have you forgotten why I'm here?
Are you trying to…
I won't put your words down in the official records today.
Do you see me as nothing more than a subject of surveillance?
It's disheartening to see you weaken like this.
These are only assumptions and circumstantial evidence.
Where's the actual intelligence?
Intelligence.
How do you expect to get assigned to the US at this rate?
That Jung Jin-soo under you. He acted out in Libya too, right?
Guys like him still whining over commies will only get in your way.
I hope I won't be seeing his name on future reports.
You take care of him then. Let's talk with results.
I told you not to go to Korean restaurants.
Are you upset that I didn't cover for you?
No, sir. Today is my birthday.
So I wanted some seaweed soup. I saw this place didn't have any Koreans
I saw this place didn't have any Koreans
and asked if they can make me some seaweed soup.
I should've told you about the account earlier.
I missed the right time to tell you.
Since when was there a right time to tell me these things?
Don't you think about my position?
We aren't after some industry spy here.
We have something called a political stance.
Shut up, asshole.
What political stance with North Koreans?
We don't even take a left at a roundabout.
In any organization, when you go up as high as I do,
you value someone who listens more than someone who's good at his job.
Do you know why you haven't moved up?
You make others uncomfortable.
What are you doing here then? I must make you uncomfortable.
I get it. I'm about to leave.
What do you want me to do anyway?
I don't care if you let go of me,
or if you are appointed to the US.
But Ho-gil, who was beaten by that commie today…
he'll be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
So, do your job.
I'll do mine.
Upstairs, please.
He's already here.
He wanted to meet here today… so he picks up the check, right?
Didn't I tell you to take your ring off for external meetings?
Being a good interpreter isn't just about delivering the message.
At Bundestag, there was some mention about North Korean diplomats
It seems the Austria incident…
caught smuggling cigarettes.
…with the North Koreans is an issue.
Why is the German parliament concerned with what happened in Austria?
As I explained earlier… it was an error in the document.
If this happens again, in other countries, the German government can't help anymore.
We need to clarify our position on the smuggled goods so that…
We gave them food when we were hungry.
And this is what we get in return.
10:00 PM TRAM LINE M1 AM KUPFERGRABEN
I just need something solid to convince Bundestag with.
You know how it works.
Everything that happens need to be recorded… in Germany.
Looks like he set up quite a feast to go after the crumbs.
Perverted bastard.
Take good care of him.
That bastard. He wants to fix this at a personal level.
We need to clarify our position on the smuggled goods so that…
We gave them food when we are hungry, and this is what we get in return.
Hey!
What brings you here?
Without calling first.
You are late.
You must be tired. Wash up and sleep.
Take good care of him.
-Let's treat your wound first. -Don't worry about it.
No message from Pyongyang?
Like what?
We were supposed to leave a long time ago.
We don't make the decisions. We just follow orders.
We could at least apply to return.
When was the last self-criticism at the embassy?
Can't you ask me why first?
I guess I was wrong.
I forgot you were the hero of the Republic more so than you are my husband.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Help, somebody. She's dead.
WAITRESS COMMITS SUICIDE BY OVERDOSING
Let's find a new way to meet up.
Kids these days… they try these fancy new techniques.
Always end up getting their asses handed to them.
Then there's guys like you and me.
Two old dogs
with old tricks…
but we're still kicking. Enough with the "old dogs".
It really makes us sound old.
I hate to break it to you, pal, but we are old.
So…
what can Uncle Marty do for his favorite ally?
I need to know…
if that guy's in your database.
A North Korean?
Black or white ops?
A ghost.
You heard about the Westin Hotel kidnapping
two days ago, didn't you?
-He was there. -You were there too?
Fuck!
You knew my team was tracking Asim and his network.
Way to bend me over the barrel, pal.
I had no time.
If I'd gotten the fucking commie,
I was going to hand in the others as my present.
Well to hell with your present.
You told me you'd leak any intel you had n the North weapons deals.
-Now you tell me the shit hit the fan-- -Shut up.
I got you a very special present.
"I got you a very special preset."
A guy named…
Sigmund.
The chairman of the Advice Minister had a meeting with
the North Korean ambassador.
At the end, the ambassador told
his female translator…
to take good care of Sigmund.
I'm going home at the end of the month, alright?
The only thing I want on my plate right now--
-is my wife's home cooking. Sorry. -Hey, hold up.
Your Foreign Affairs would love it.
That took longer than I thought.
I had to take care of something upon arrival.
I wasn't told about that.
You'll know why when you see.
In my day, we never had conflicting commands.
Always just a single command.
That's not how it's done these days.
The new comrade chairman doesn't like the old ways.
You recognize her right?
Yeah, I go there often.
The German do too.
So do the South Koreans.
Comrade ambassador…
Pyongyang thinks there's a mole in our Berlin office right now.
That's not possible.
"Those who appear the most trustworthy deserve the most suspicion."
Words of comrade Stalin.
-Did you report it to the Party? -I left a record of it.
But wouldn't it be better coming from you rather than me revealing it through an investigation?
What if there's no evidence?
So you'd say the Party was wrong to say there was a leak?
Well, now.
You'd be saying the Party was wrong.
That would make the Party incompetent.
Say that again.
Who sold the information?
The woman…
the interpreter for the Embassy.
They made the reservation under the name
Ryun Jung-hee
The waitress that was a spy for South Korea turned herself in.
You know that's not true.
Are you saying that Dong Myung-soo forged the confession?
Whether he did or not doesn't matter.
That an official evidence recorded by the Party dispatch
contains your wife's name is what matters.
A name they wanted to hear at that.
If you try to protect her when the Party says she's guilty…
you'll be guilty too.
There's no real evidence other than this confession.
You were the one that said…
it could be one of us that leaked the weapons deal intel.
From where I stand, I need to provide immediate answers.
Or at least an alternative.
How much do I have?
Two days.
Black clouds are coming in…
but there's nowhere to hide from the rain.
Are you sure it was this woman?
Yes.
How's work these days?
Same old.
What you said about Pyongyang the other day…
was it because you wanted to go back?
Let's not talk about that.
I believe that we can live proud even if we are poor.
We get three that reside in Germany with more than 85% match.
Two have identifiable points.
Let's look at this travel agency guy.
This one doesn't have many pictures.
The only one we have is from when he got the cultural exchange award.
Okay.
Shit!
Hey, you interested in something hot?
What?
A North Korean official stationed in Berlin just filed for defection.
To America?
No, he's asking for political asylum through the UN to some third country.
When's the next contact?
What's going on? You never call during the day.
I had to stop by the embassy.
Have you had lunch?
I had to go to the Bundestag Library.
I don't think we can do lunch together.
Okay, see you at home.
Moran Peak 4639.
Checking on comrade Ryun Jung-hee's sign-out logs.
The next station is Brandenburger Tor.
Nothing on record.
Is the Bundestag Library at Brandenburger?
That's closer to the Bundestag station.
What's at Brandenbrug?
That's where the embassies are. British and US embassies too.
List this as a secret correspondence. I'll report it myself.
Are you going out?
You didn't say anything to me.
US EMBASSY
When is the next…
When is the next contact…
When is the next… When is the next contact…
Long time no see.
We still have two days.
Did you put a tail on Jung-hee?
I'm not here to discuss your wife.
Man, how did you end up like this?
So thorough outside and yet a wreck at home.
Something's not right here.
Is that an official statement?
We'll know soon enough.
I'm not saying you did anything wrong.
The guilty will have to stand for their own crimes.
So why are you really here?
There's a bit of a situation.
It's not my job so I can't intervene.
Look at this.
What a happy family.
We have a traitor seeking exile.
Someone from the embassy.
It's comrade Ri Hak-su.
Comrade Ri Hak-su took out all funds from the embassy safe today.
DEVICE WILL SELF DESTRUCT AFTER PLAYING
Your password will be verbally confirmed upon point of contact.
The agent's key-phrase is, "It looks like it's going to rain."
Your answer, verbatim, is, "But I've lost my folding umbrella."
Here's the time and place of contact.
Hey, what's taking you so long? What?
What's taking me so long?
You're the one that wanted some private time with the guy.
We're gonna head to the US Embassy
and into the safe house.
-You mean the laundromat? -Excuse me, do you speak English?
We got about…
three hours until the official time of contact.
So, factoring in travel, I can spare you about an hour.
We can tell him you work for the company.
You're helping us with the debrief.
And that's as far as you and I take this.
After that, it's every old dog for himself.
And regardless of what happens here,
the CIA has no affiliation, what so ever, with this operation.
There should be absolutely no records, you hear me?
What's he offering you?
Yeah, we're not sure yet.
He mentioned something about a file. Some shady account they've been managing.
He mentioned something about a file. Some shady account they've been managing. The Kim Jong-il account from Macau?
Oh, sweet Jesus.
Now wouldn't that make everyone's fucking day.
You owe me, pal.
Big time.
Eleven o'clock. Target's location confirmed.
Look more natural, will you?
You tapped my phone?
Are you out of your mind? That's CIA's target!
How is the North Korean ambassador CIA's target?
He's ours.
If you don't know shit, get out of the way.
I'll take responsibility for this.
Hey, you bastard!
He's moving towards the subway.
A follow and B go to the other side. We need to get him first.
Jong… Jong-sung.
Think hard.
Save the talk for later.
Freeze!
Put the gun down!
This is our turf. You don't want any more trouble.
Hey, I'm sorry.
You listen carefully.
Get back to headquarters, and bring me any information…
on the CIA agents here.
- But the CIA-- - Shut up, you bastard.
If you ever talk back to me again, or get in my way,
I'm gonna fucking blast your brains out you bastard.
-I got to… -What did you do in school?
I got to do a ballet.
And… would you, was it fun?
Say something.
Hi Daddy, I love you!
-Goodbye. -No…
We have… Come on, Cindy.
You know my team was tracking Asim and his network.
Way to bend me over the barrel, pal.
Hey, it's me. Send me the address of that travel agency.
Why'd you do it?
Think about it.
Why do you think Dong Myung-soo is here?
Why's your wife being suspected of being a spy?
You were willing to throw away your family and run off to the west.
We are only puppets in Dong Myung-soo's, no, his dad, Dong Jung-ho's plot
to take over the Berlin office.
How do you think Dong Jung-ho survived
despite supporting King Jong-nam not Kim Jong-un?
Because he lent a hand
when Kim Jong-un's affiliates wanted to sell weapons abroad.
CIA TRACKS DOWN ILLEGAL NORTH KOREAN ACCOUNT IN MACAU
Now that the secret Macau account is uncovered by the Americans
his family needs a new ploy in order to survive.
What exactly did you ask Jung-hee to do?
You aren't listening to a word I say.
Jong-sung
When you are stuck at sea, sing Arirang a half-key lower,
and for the chorus, sing Whistle.
The Party would like a direct report.
Tell me what they want to hear.
I'll say exactly that.
Just don't make me die a painful death.
Please.
You really don't care about your family in Pyongyang, do you?
There's not much I can do, anyway.
One would think we were falsely accusing him.
Name. Affiliation.
Ri Hak-su,
Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
Berlin Embassy.
Ambassador.
So why'd you betray us?
I just sent you the address of the travel agency.
I see frequent address changes.
It really looks like a front company.
Don't I need to report this to Mr. Kang?
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.
Hello.
There's been a break-in at my building.
The address is Einstenufer 9D.
It's a travel agency.
What happened?
What about you?
Why did you lie about where you were?
-Don't you have something to tell me? -So you knew all about it?
You weren't going to tell me?
I don't know where to start.
I guess I missed the right time.
Start from the beginning.
It was an order from the Ambassador.
-Not something I'd wanted. -You haven't told me what I want to hear.
I must not know what you want.
What the hell have you been up to?
What do you want me to do then? Entertaining is part of the command.
But…
the child I carry is ours.
This male traveler asked about the festival in the plaza,
so I told him when it was.
And this is where the gynecologist is.
Why didn't you tell me?
I was afraid you'd think it wasn't ours.
It doesn't matter what I think. Just tell me the truth.
This is the truth.
If this is the truth, why didn't you say so?
Did you ever listen to me?
Do you know how it feels to stoop so low just so we can live?
Our first child…
was gone so fast, I can't even remember.
It's already been two years.
How painful it must've been for such a little thing.
Have you thought about that?
So?
Were you going to get rid of this child?
That's all you can come up with?
We'll go to the doctor tomorrow.
-If you are lying-- -I'll be reported as a spy?
That would make you feel better, huh?
Because the Party said I'm a spy.
Comrade Ri Hak-su tried to defect to the west today.
Write down what you did in the past week. Leave nothing out.
Hey, did you get her to confess?
-We still have time left. -Shucks.
I'm disturbing your alone time, aren't I?
How'd Ri Hak-su's investigation go?
It went well, thanks to you.
He will be repatriated back to Pyongyang.
Good job.
I don't have evidence to prove Jung-hee's charges yet.
You can relax now.
Hey…
congratulations.
You've passed the Party election test.
All of this was because of Ri Hak-su.
Since the death of comrade chairman,
we noticed a significant decrease in the foreign currency coming into Pyongyang.
You see, the Party had the hunch that Ri Hak-su would rake in private assets and seek asylum,
while we were busy building up support for comrade Kim Jong-un back North.
But then they had your name on the list too.
Myself included, we all said you would never do that.
But the Party has its stance.
So I suggested a test.
Well, well.
How could the Party suspect someone who'd turn in his own wife when things go sour?
Well then,
our agents will be at your place shortly.
You go on to Pyongyang, get congratulated,
and come back here with a new promotion.
Congratulations.
You saved my face too.
How far did you hear?
You are a coward.
What the hell are you doing?
Once they find out what you're doing to me, you're a fucking dead man!
What do you think will happen to you?
Today,
a North Korean fucking commie blew a hole through my friend's head.
At Bradenburg gate?
My friend was CIA tracking Asim's group.
If I report your ID
and tell them that Israel is working with…
the North Koreans who took Asim,
your fucking face will be on every CIA watch list
before 48 hours.
What now?
Do you want to call a diplomatic dispute with America over this?
About a month ago
Pyongyang contacted Mossad Collections.
I'm not here to discuss your wife.
So thorough outside, and yet a wreck at home.
Man, how did you end up like this?
The guilty will have to stand for their own crimes.
They told us
that if we gave them the opportunity
to replace a few of their people in Berlin,
then they'd hand over the man they do business with, Asim.
The weapons deal had to fail.
It was the opportunity they needed.
Did someone on the inside betray the North?
I only know what I need to know.
But I think the North Korean agent at the scene
was double-crossed.
Noise level suddenly rose inside the house, watch out.
WIRE TAPPED
You have the phone records from that time?
You want those?
REPORTING YOU TO THE PARTY, NEVER TOLD DONG MYUNG-SOO THAT
I have recorded everything you've said here.
HEARD ABOUT BEING REPORTED FROM YOU FIRST
HOW CAN I PASS THE TEST
WHEN I NEVER REPORTED YOU? IT'S A TRAP.
WE MUST RUN!
Do you want to delete it?
Then you're gonna give me your conversation with the fucking commie!
Did you pack up?
I need to take a record for the report.
Looking for this?
These idiots.
I told them to be careful.
Why weren't they more cautious?
Hello?
Abdul.
Hello?
Sorry I'm late.
So you heard what happened to your brother?
The Mossad executed him without a trial.
I found the rat who gave your brother Asim over to the Israelis.
If you get on it now, you can still catch him.
Who is it?
It's someone we both know.
Pyo Jong-sung.
Take it.
There was a police report on a gunfight.
One of the residents there
is an interpreter at the North Korean embassy.
Hey…
You can tap the CIA satellite communication monitoring network, right?
Send over all channels within 20 km radius from the site.
Are you crazy?
Didn't I tell you to just do as you're told, bastard?
I know you're good at wire-tapping.
-See you again. -Watch your back.
You're going to run into the Mossad again one day,
and it won't be pretty.
Stop blabbering for God's sake.
Do you have a room?
I prefer to not fill out the register.
You okay?
Let's treat your wound first.
Hey, Policeman. I'm from the Consulate.
I'm here to ID the victim, okay?
Can you speak English?
-Nein. -No?
We got a call from a Korean news source.
No problem, just a moment.
Gunshot. Head, chest. Precisely one shot each.
Not circumcised.
Judging from teeth definitely North Koreans.
Hey, I need to run now.
-Hey, halt! -I'll be right back.
Those bastards…
Fine.
He killed all of our comrades and escaped.
He's good, huh? He's good, huh?
Okay.
First, have your men search every hotel within ten kilometers.
Their names will not be on record, so look for a couple who paid in cash
and checked in in the last ten minutes.
How certain are you of this?
It's what he taught me.
If you're being hunted, hide right under the hound's nose.
Hello?
This is a direct order from the boss.
Search every hotel within ten kilometers.
You're looking for a man and woman who paid cash and didn't register.
-I'm sending you their pictures now. -Okay.
North Koreans, Abdul, and Asim are all on the CIA satellite network.
- They're using Arabic. - Arabic? Location?
Concentrated within 10 km from the site of incident.
Give us the traitor.
I'd like to…
but I need to get them back as a set.
Hey listen, man…
If I become the director in Berlin,
then we cut out the broker. Everything is cheaper and faster.
We can pack up some super notes for you, if you want
because no one makes better dollars than we do.
But that's only after you drag out this bastard's corpse, isn't it?
Trust me.
Where are you now?
It's a couple?
KOOMERS BANK LOGIN
SORRY, COULD NOT MATCH LOGIN PASSWORD PLEASE TRY AGAIN
Jong-sung, when you are stuck at sea sing Arirang a half-key lower.
For the chorus, sing Whistle.
ARIRANG SHEET MUSIC
You see, the Party had a hunch
that Ri Hak-su would rake in private assets and seek asylum
because Dong Jung-ho lent a hand
when Kim Jong-un's affiliates wanted to sell weapons abroad.
But then, your name was on the list too.
Now that the Macau account was found by the Americans…
…his family needs a new ploy in order to survive.
How could the Party suspect someone who'd turn in his own wife when things go sour?
Think about it.
Why would Dong Myung-soo be here?
And why suspect your wife of being a spy?
Listen to me carefully.
Dong Myung-soo is working on a plot
to blame me for leaking some information on the embassy's secret account.
Make Ri Hak-su and me traitors
and swallow whole the Berlin embassy
with his father.
If that's true, what are you doing here?
Can I go to Pyongyang now?
This is the end for us.
Where are you going?
I can prove this all to the Party. Trust me.
The Party, the people, the country they can all doubt me,
but you…
you shouldn't have.
Are you saying you'll seek asylum?
You should be punished for being so cruel.
You can kill me anytime but not now.
We're not here to kill you.
But if you resist, we have no choice.
You've ten seconds to choose.
One, two,
three, four…
We three will live no matter what…
…six,
seven, eight,
…Only focus on that.
ten.
Gun!
You only got the woman? What about the other one?
You said there would be only two. You gave out incorrect information.
There was another man there.
What?
Another guy? A Yankee?
They said he looked like you.
It's a South Korean.
Wow…
Welcome South Korean guy!
Damn, what a gutsy move. This will be interesting.
Let me get this straight.
My team breaks up the arms deal Yuri set for Asim,
and you'll hand both of them over to us?
I don't believe you.
Now, bastard, if you want to hear the rest, drive.
Well, it's been a while, hasn't it?
This is why I like you.
Why do you think I let you go at the hotel that time?
Macau to Berlin.
Weapons deal, spy at the embassy, murder, and asylum.
How do I even begin to put these together to make sense of them?
Ri Hak-su's hidden card, that account.
Four billion dollars left behind by Kim Jong-il. That would make sense.
Now that Kim Jong-il is dead,
they need to switch over the account to Kim Jong-un
to restructure the line of command,
but Ri Hak-su and Pyongyang aren't on best terms.
Pyongyang thinks that
this diplomat doesn't have confidence in the new young leader.
Best to get rid of him before he turns against them.
And you got squeezed in as a wholesale package deal.
It's all over for you.
You are wrong.
It's not the Republic that betrayed me.
Do North and South use different words these days?
If you must know, get the facts right.
This is all Dong Jung-ho's doing.
Who?
The father of the guy that shot your friend underground.
The account doesn't belong to chairman. It's for Dong Jung-ho and other officials.
Ri Hak-su was part of that before he got thrown out.
Where's that bastard right now?
Pyo Jong-sung is in South Korean hands now.
It's all over.
You are not waiting for someone who'd turn in his own wife to save himself, right?
How about this?
Confess that Pyo Jong-sung is a double spy.
I'll take care of the rest of the story.
How long do you think you'll last doing this to us
without the Party's approval?
Who knows?
-Who knows about this place? -The person who used to use it.
It's me.
Have you gotten so full of yourself eating sausages everyday? What's taken so long?
Those South Korean bastards are they good to you?
Let Jung-hee go.
We can't have a confession without a witness.
After all, you've teamed up with the South Koreans guys.
Let me talk to Jung-hee.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Try to calm down and hang in there.
For now…
do what Myung-soo says.
I'll come for you before long.
Why are you giving her false hopes?
You better watch out if you want to die in peace.
I will die whenever I want to.
You shut up and get over here now. Understood?
Let me go, and I'll get the account for you.
Hey, Pyo Jong-sung.
Do I look like a nice person to you?
If you don't let me go, you will never see that account.
And you'll never see your wife.
An innocent woman's life is in danger.
We all die.
She is carrying a child.
It's not my child, is it?
I'll defect.
MR KANG: CAN'T GIVE SUPPORT
ALL ACTIVITY FOR THE LAST 48 HOURS HAVE NO RELEVANCE TO US.
Support might be a bit late.
With the Arabs around, more people only mean more danger for the hostage.
If you can take the back, I can handle this alone.
And when you defect,
your wife is coming South with you, right?
My wife may be against defecting with me.
You're honest, now that we're all the way out here.
You are risking your life for a wife that may or may not come with you?
If you were me, would you understand?
What makes less sense to me is why you are risking your life.
Because this is my job. Do you need a reason to work?
You just do it.
She's my wife.
I don't need a reason to save my wife.
Is he really coming?
He's going to be a while.
He won't be here till after 4:00 a.m.
Standard KGB attack time, when humans are weakest.
Like that.
Wait any longer, and it'll be sunrise.
Have you received sniper training?
I was awarded leave for excellent shooting by my division commander.
Position secured.
Be careful.
Outside… two North Koreans, two Arabs.
At the center table inside, two Arabs.
Center, three o'clock by the window one North Korean.
The woman…
is at the left end, tied to the chair.
As for her status…
she is fine.
Hey, if you hear me, shake your head.
Shake your head!
Damn it.
You can't kill a man like that.
Revenge is a dish
best served cold.
Where are your South Korean friends?
Would I bring in idiots to catch a fool?
Keep alert and bring the girl.
You tried hard to find a way out of this, huh?
You didn't need to do that.
Your family has enough to take over Berlin station regardless.
You can't have two heads atop one body.
You know hunger doesn't bother us but jealousy does.
That's all the trust there is between comrade chairman and comrade Dong?
Comrade chairman is a human after all.
Human beings tend to betray.
I'm here to be that traitor, as you wish.
If you let us go,
we'll live in hiding for the rest of our lives.
Everything you want to hear is in there.
Such an effort to live.
It's an honor to hear a Republic hero confess.
"Comrade Pyo Jong-sung has betrayed the Republic."
I can't wait.
Let's play it.
Before you do…
I have one question.
Did you set me against my wife knowing that her hospital
was near the US embassy?
You said she was pregnant, right?
I just threw it out there.
You were the one that put it together.
Protecting the innocent until proven guilty…
Isn't that your specialty?
I, Pyo Jong-sung of DPRK would like to take this time
to confess.
The Party wants to replace the Berlin branch.
But right now,
replacing the current officials isn't justified.
You bastard!
Play the rest.
If we ambush the deal Yuri is into with Asim,
then you will have the justified reasons
to replace the current officials, right?
Right. So finally, you Israelis will have Yuri and Asim.
Like you've been wanting,
we can hand them over.
Explain yourself.
What did I always tell you?
You rush too much and make critical mistakes.
You think you have everything.
Acting like the hero of the Republic and look where you are.
I'll admit you were a good teacher.♪
Don't worry.
You need to leave me to live.
You don't mean that.
I know how you feel.
If you do, hang in there and live.
It's okay. I'm on your side.
This…
Can you move?
Kill me. Kill me now.
You know that killing me won't end all.
I'll go back and talk to my father about it.
Let's wrap it up here. What do you say?
Human beings tend to betray.
Your hometown, where is it?
It's okay now.
Let's go.
Let's go, Jung-hee.
We still have…
so much to talk about.
Let's go.
We can still make it.
I'm sorry.
Jung-hee…
Come on.
Wake up.
Jung-hee.
Wake up.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go home. Let's go home.
What's the progress so far?
We just have the last step left.
It's up to him.
He can come to the South or seek asylum elsewhere through UN.
Good job, everyone.
We'll wrap up this case here then.
Anything regarding the secret account or Pyo Jong-sung should be shredded.
Keep only minimal record as top secret, classified.
There's a few steps left officially…
the President has just announced in Russia
a transcontinental gas pipeline project going through Pyongyang.
We already have a deal with Pyongyang.
Turning over the account and Pyo Jong-sung is the last term on the agreement.
Does that mean Pyo will be purged with Dong Jung-ho?
Why would Dong Jung-ho be purged?
He's the one that sealed the deal.
You know how it works. They won't go down easily.
Get out.
Get out, you commie bastard!
I can't stand to see a commie like you live a cushy life.
Go.
You couldn't protect your wife nor the child she carried.
You betrayed the guy who put his life on line for you. That's who you are.
You betrayed your country. You betrayed your people.
That's the kind of person you'll be. Live in hiding from now on.
Go unnoticed. Live like dust for the rest of your life.
Don't even think about whining
or taking sloppy revenge.
Just live enough to breathe…
like regular people.
It's me.
How are you?
Did you think that you'd live after what you did to my son?
You can't go anywhere.
We are not the only ones after you.
You don't need to look for me. I'll come to you.
You better be here soon.
You'll be on all fours begging me to kill you when you do!
Nica. There's somebody at the door. I'm busy.
Nica, please.
God!
What are you doing that's so important?
I was playing solitaire.
SARAH: The computer cheats, you know.
Yeah, well, I'm used to that.
Morning. Hi.
Got a delivery for Mrs. Sarah Pierce?
I'll... I'll sign for it.
Cool.
You know, you don't look like a Mrs.
(CHUCKLES) Oh, I'm...
I'm not. It's for my mother.
Oh, God. I'm back living with my mother, too.
It's just a fucking nightmare, right?
(SOFTLY) You have no idea.
Wait a minute. Oh, my God. I know you.
You do?
You do? Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, City College. The Psych Department, right?
That was me.
Well, when'd you graduate?
Well, when'd you graduate? I didn't. I never completed my thesis.
Oh, on what?
Uh... Completion anxiety.
Thought only guys got that.
So, is your mom home now or what?
Yeah.
Too bad.
Well, uh, see you around.
Bye.
Was that guy hitting on me?
Baby, you're beautiful.
Thank you. But I... I think that guy was hitting on me.
Maybe I should go ask him out. (LAUGHS) Nica.
(LAUGHS) Nica.
He was just being nice.
I'm sorry.
Oh, honey, I just don't ever want to see you get hurt.
I thought you swore off the Home Shopping Network.
I haven't bought anything in three weeks.
Maybe you have a secret admirer.
You sound threatened.
No. Not at all.
I just wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
Who's it from?
It doesn't say.
Must be some kind of joke.
I don't get it.
Neither do I.
He's cute.
If you say so.
Hi. I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
Alice will love him.
I DVR'd  Real Housewives.
I'm going to make tuna melts later. Okay?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Oh, God.
Mom! No.
I need an ambulance right away. It's my mother.
I don't know. I don't know. There's so much blood.
Nica.
I'm sorry. (SOBBING)
She was fine.
She was taking her meds, she was painting again.
No. No. She was fine.
How could she do that, Barbie?
How could she do that to herself?
You, uh... You remember Father Frank.
Uh... Yes. Hello, Father.
I'm so very sorry for your loss, Nica.
Thank you.
Your sister just thought it might be a good idea for me to come.
I appreciate it.
But you know my mother and I both left the church a long time ago.
But you know my mother and I both left the church a long time ago. But not in the eyes of God.
BARB: I just thought it might be nice for us to have someone to talk to.
We have each other.
Nica.
We have to pray for her. To be forgiven.
She was sick. You can't judge her.
FATHER FRANK: No one is judging her.
In fact, the church's official response to a situation like this
is not to judge, but to pity.
(SIGHS) My mother and I have had quite enough pity, thank you.
I understand.
(SIGHS) It was my fault.
I should have seen it coming.
Nica, you cannot blame yourself.
She was supposed to be taking care of you.
Hey. Hey, Ian.
Gimme a hug.
Is that a new chair?
Uh, yeah. (CHUCKLES)
It's cool. Thank you. (SNIFFLES)
Uh, this... This is Jill, my new au pair.
No, I'm just the nanny. Hi.
I'm so sorry, Nica.
Thank you. I'm, uh, I'm glad you're here.
Come here, you.
I'm so happy to see you. Me, too.
Me, too.
Did Grandma go to heaven?
Yes, sweetie, she did.
Hey, I have a surprise for you.
That's funny.
Oh, Mommy, I have to go to the bathroom.
BARB: Okay. Jill will take you.
You show her the way. Mommy needs to talk to Aunty Nica.
ALICE: Jill, let's go.
Um... I think I'm going to go with them. Okay?
Remember, you don't have to lock the door.
But somebody might come in.
We won't let anybody in.
But what about you guys? Hmm.
Honey, we really don't want to see you do your business.
Okay, bye. (BOTH CHUCKLE)
So listen, how much is she paying you again?
$400 a week.
That's more than I make. (CHUCKLES)
JILL: Well, maybe you should consider a career change.
IAN: Hey, I'd be a great nanny. $400 a week!
(ALICE HUMMING) Man.
JILL: Yeah, but no benefits. (URINATING)
What's your name?
Alice? Alice, open the door, honey!
Alice? Alice, open the door right now.
He scared me half to death.
What is this?
Well, um, Mom left the house to both of us.
So?
So.
I think we should consider selling.
What are you talking about?
Nica, this place is fabulous.
It's so much closer to us, we'd get to see you way more often.
And with your half of what we could get for the house,
you'd be set for the rest of your life.
This isn't about me. This is about money.
Well, you know we've been struggling.
Print media is dead.
Ian's working at Starbucks.
We're going to have to send Alice to public school.
And she so had her heart set on St. Bridget's.
I don't want to deprive my child.
You have a live-in nanny.
Well, actually, that's not really working out.
Barb, this is my home.
Nica, I know this is hard.
But do you really think you can manage here all by yourself?
Mom would have wanted you to be taken care of.
That's all she ever wanted.
We're back.
NICA: You found him.
He was in the bathroom.
Really?
You know, I think Grandma would have wanted you to take care of him.
BARB: It was obviously sent here by mistake.
It must belong to someone else.
It must belong to someone else. And Alice, you already have too many dolls as it is.
Yeah, but Chucky's my friend till the end!
Yeah, but Chucky's my friend till the end! I actually think it's a really nice gesture. Thank you, Aunty Nica.
I actually think it's a really nice gesture. Thank you, Aunty Nica.
It's a doll.
What's the worst that can happen, huh?
I like to be hugged.
I like to hug you, too, Chucky.
What's that, Chucky?
Oh! Chucky wants to know what's for dinner.
BARB: Well.
I guess I better get started in the kitchen.
NICA: Oh, don't be silly.
NICA: Oh, don't be silly. Uh, you guys are my guests and you must be exhausted from your flight,
please just make yourselves at home.
Father Frank, you will stay for dinner, won't you?
Well, I, uh... I'd love to, Nica. Thanks.
Uh, you're going to make dinner. For six.
Seven.
Well, I will need a chef's assistant.
And Chucky can be my assistant.
Great. Let's get cooking.
Mmm. It's really good. It's the oregano.
Did you finish setting the table?
Almost.
Pay the toll. We're on a roll.
Oh, no, honey, don't touch that. Can you grab me the napkins?
The fancy ones from last Christmas.
FATHER FRANK: This smells delicious.
NICA: Thanks. ALICE: Come on, Chucky.
IAN: Wow. Look at this, Nica. You've really outdone yourself this time.
ALICE: We are going to sit right here.
NICA: Barb, sit next to me here. BARB: Okay. If you insist.
JILL: Wow. Look at this.
NICA: Thanks, Jill. Make yourself comfortable.
BARB: Oh. You brought out the nice china.
BARB: Father, would you like to say grace?
Bless us, oh Lord, and these Thy gifts
which we are about to receive from Thy bounty.
Stop. Through Jesus Christ our Lord we pray.
Amen.
Jill? Mmm. Thank you, Ian.
Don't mind if I do.
How about you, Father?
Oh, no. I'm good.
I am starving.
Uh, wait.
Your daddy would like to make a toast.
To the chef.
Thank you. I had a great assistant.
I love chili. Do you really?
Yeah. Me, too. Love it.
(SNIFFING) Is there meat in this?
No. Not at all.
It's vegetarian.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. What?
This is amazing!
(ALL CHUCKLING) I know. I can't believe there's no meat in this.
It's so hearty.
It's the oregano.
This is just the way my mama used to make it.
Nica, could you pass me the salt?
Thank you.
You know, that doll, it looks really familiar somehow.
IAN: Oh, Father, come on.
Good Guy dolls were all the rage back in the '80s.
My brother even had one. So did mine.
Are you serious? Yes.
(LAUGHS) Oh, come on. JILL: That is wild... I...
I seem to remember seeing them on the news?
I remember seeing people standing in line overnight
just to get their hands on one of these.
just to get their hands on one of these. They were right up there with Smurfs and Cabbage Patch Kids.
Alice, honey, is something wrong?
It tastes funny.
Maybe we put too much oregano in.
Alice, sweetheart, it's not that bad.
Eat it.
Father, are you all right?
Oh, I'm...
I'm so sorry, I'm going to have to be going.
Oh, my God, Father, are you ill?
Oh, no, I'm fine.
(STAMMERING) I have an appointment back at the church.
Nica, thank you so much, the chili was delicious.
Father, are you... No, please forgive me.
I don't mean to be rude.
I'll see you all in the morning at the cemetery.
Good night.
I'm so sorry.
Where is he?
This way.
What happened?
Lost control, hit them head on.
Probably drunk.
No, no, this isn't right. I know him, I'm in his parish.
He doesn't drink anymore. You sure about that?
He's my sponsor.
Stanton, you're going to need a drink after you see this.
Jesus Christ. (GASPS)
Steel's got him pinned. He's lost a shitload of blood, but we just can't tell from where.
Father, can you hear me? Father? (RASPING)
Just hang on! We're going to get you out.
What the hell are you waiting for? Get this shit off him!
I can't make that call.
I can't make that call. He's bleeding to death! Get him out!
FIREMAN 1: Okay, set in. FIREMAN 2: On my count.
One, two, pull.
BARB: Oh. Oh. This is an oldie.
(JILL LAUGHS) JILL: Oh, my God. Is that you?
Shut up. (LAUGHS)
You're so cute.
It's called baby fat. (LAUGHS)
Look, I didn't say anything.
Go back to sleep. Will do.
Look at her.
She's so happy.
What happened to your dad?
He drowned that year, couple of weeks before Nica was born.
Mom was never the same after that.
Who's that?
Some neighbor back in Chicago, I guess.
What a weirdo.
JILL: Hey there, missy, what'cha up to?
Chucky's gone.
Not again. Well, where did you leave him?
I didn't. He's hiding.
BARB: Okay, time for bed.
And don't forget to brush your teeth and your hair.
What about Chucky?
Jill will go look for Chucky.
I'll give you a hand, Jill. Uh-uh. We're not done here yet.
ALICE: I think he's hiding under my bed.
JILL: Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'm going to be right back.
JILL: Are you sure you didn't leave him downstairs?
ALICE: I didn't leave him anywhere. He's hiding.
There he goes!
I am not in the mood for this.
Need a hand?
I need a fucking search party!
I have looked over every inch of this house and I can't find him anywhere.
God, I've missed you. Shut up.
You found him.
I think she wanted you to find him.
You know, I haven't been spending enough time with her.
It's like if I'm not working, I'm just so tired all the time.
Life is short! (LAUGHS)
Did they always say that?
I don't know.
Listen, little man, what else are you, uh,
telling my kid behind my back, huh?
I like to be hugged.
Oh. And? Hey. Wanna play?
Is that it? Hi. I'm Chucky.
And I'm your friend till the end. (LAUGHS)
That one's a classic.
That one's a classic. Ah... And it works on so many different levels.
Ah... And it works on so many different levels. Yeah, the '80s were awesome.
ALICE: Did you find him yet?
Yeah, we found him!
I'll take him up.
Ian?
Anyone?
Hello?
(EMERGENCY BELL RINGS) Oh, shit.
(RINGING CONTINUES) Coming!
See, with her, it's always something.
She needs my help and then resents me for it.
You're the only one who really appreciates me.
JILL: You know, I was thinking. Hmm?
We can get by without the money.
You don't have to sell.
I mean, this is her home.
She's a mess. You can see that.
Oh, crap.
There you are, Chucky! We've been looking for you everywhere.
Hey, want to play?
(CHUCKLES) I didn't know you could do that.
Playtime's over. It's time for bed.
Can you read us a bedtime story?
Aunty Nica's tired, sweetie. We'll let her rest now.
I'm fine.
It's important that you don't overextend yourself.
(SIGHS) Don't you think I'm the best judge of when I'm overextending myself?
Frankly, no. (SCOFFS)
Really.
I don't think you realize the strain you're under.
There's no shame in admitting that you need help.
You mean "assistance."
Nica, I am worried about your heart. Okay?
Dr. Masur said I was fine, Barb.
You're at significant risk of it happening again, you know that.
13% of all T5 paraplegics... I know the statistics.
Dr. Masur said that extreme stress,
any kind of even mild shock could bring it on.
And since last night, God knows you've had plenty of both.
(SIGHS) Alice, sweetheart, please come down from there.
I'm disabled, Barb, I am not a child.
And I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself.
Aunty Nica, you're bleeding.
Oh, my God.
I got it. Okay?
It almost looks like a knife wound.
You must have cut yourself making dinner.
I... I didn't.
Doesn't it hurt?
No. No, don't worry, sweetie.
She can't feel a thing.
All right, come on. Come on. Off to bed now.
Good night, Aunty Nica.
Good night, baby. Sweet dreams.
ALICE: Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I shall die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.
God bless Grandma, and Mommy, and Daddy, and Jill.
And especially Aunty Nica.
What about Chucky?
He says there is no God.
Who said that? Chucky did.
He said that life's a bitch and then you die, bleeding like a stuck pig.
Alice. You know it's not nice to curse.
I don't curse, Mommy. Chucky did.
Mommy, am I going to die?
No. Of course not, sweetie.
Grandma died. And Chucky says we're all going to die.
Alice, who really told you that?
Was it Jill? No.
Was it your daddy? No, it was Chucky.
Okay.
Can't we sleep in with you tonight?
(SIGHS) Alice, we've talked about this. You're a big girl now.
It's only a storm.
And Jill's going to be in in a while.
Don't forget Chucky!
Don't worry, Chucky. It's only a storm.
CUSTOMER SERVICE REP: Ma'am, thank you for holding. The package... (GARBLED THROUGH STATIC)
...evidence depository.
(STATIC RESUMES) Um... I'm... I'm sorry, you're breaking up. Did you say "evidence depository"?
I'm... I'm sorry, you're breaking up. Did you say "evidence depository"?
Hello? Hello, are you there?
Chucky, I'm scared.
You fucking should be.
Sorry.
We found him.
She sure loves that thing.
Yeah. She sure does.
But you know, I just called the delivery company,
and they said it was sent from an evidence depository.
As in crime scene evidence?
I don't know. Maybe I heard them wrong. The connection was bad.
I'm sure that's it.
Yeah, but we still don't know who sent it.
I don't care if it was the Manson family.
Anything that keeps her this happy is fine by me.
She's been so sad lately.
I better get to bed. Long day tomorrow.
Uh... Good night.
Good night, Jill.
Andy Barclay.
Charles.
(WHISPERING) She's up.
CHUCKY: Women.
Can't live with 'em. Period.
Shit.
What's going on?
Power's out again.
I'm going to go check on Alice.
What about Jill?
What about her? Well, come on, Barb.
You're paying her $400 a week to take care of our kid.
Don't you think she can handle it? (SCOFFS)
Ian, she's afraid of the dark.
It's storming out. She might need me.
Who, exactly, might need you?
Who do you think?
Right now I'm not sure what to think.
You know... (CHUCKLES)
Don't try to implicate me in your sick fantasies, okay?
I've seen the way you look at her.
Ditto.
Ian, I am not sleeping with the nanny.
No, of course, you couldn't be that stupid, Barb.
Knowing that if I could prove such a thing,
I could easily take Alice away from you.
Or I could just check the footage.
What are you talking about?
The footage from the nanny cam.
What nanny cam?
The one I hid in the doll today.
You are not taking my daughter away from me. Do you hear me?
I am not going to let you destroy this family
because of your sick, paranoid accusations.
Oh, that's right. Tune me out.
Let Barb take care of everything.
That's what you always do anyway, right?
You latte-making loser.
STANTON: What's the word from Forensics?
DISPATCH:  Won't know anything for sure till they cook his blood.
Hey, you talk to anyone at St. Paul's yet?
Said he was out at the Pierce house all day.
Okay, well, maybe they'll have some answers for us.
I'm going to head out there now.
BARB: Alice?
Alice! I don't have time to play games.
Barb?
Barb!
Barb, where's Alice?
Playing fucking hide-and-seek.
Barb, put him down.
What is wrong with you?
Look, I know that this sounds nuts, but that doll,
I think that there's something in it.
Wait a second. You know about this?
(STAMMERS) Well, I think that I do. You know what's in this?
Do you?
(GASPS) Why didn't you tell me?
I'm trying to tell you. Wait, wait. When did you find out?
What does it matter? It matters to me.
It matters to me that my own sister is out to get me.
No. No, no, no, you don't understand, this... Oh, I understand perfectly.
Oh, I understand perfectly.
Oh, I understand perfectly. I understand you resent the fact that I actually have a life.
No, Barb, this isn't about anything that... Well, you know what, Nica?
Well, you know what, Nica?
It isn't my fault. Okay?
What happened to you isn't my fault.
And it isn't my fault that you dropped out of school,
and it isn't my fault that you chose
to never leave this goddamned house.
I mean, what the hell were you waiting for, a sign from God?
No, Barb! Just put the fucking doll down!
Fuck you, Nica.
Barb!
BARB: Alice! Get down here!
Jill?
Ian!
Shit!
BARB: Alice?
Alice, don't touch anything. You hear me?
Alice, you are in big trouble, young lady!
Alice!
Alice, please.
(SIGHS) Mommy is just about sick to death of all of you.
Alice?
Alice, you come out here right this minute.
Oh, my God.
Alice.
Alice is mine.
Now she knows
there is no God.
You have your mother's eyes.
And they were always too fucking close together! (SCREAMS) No!
(PANTING)
Barbie?
Nica.
(IN SING-SONG) I'm gonna get you.
Alice!
Alice!
Ian! Ian! (CHUCKLING)
Ian! Ian!
Ian!
Ian! Ian!
Wha... Huh? What?
Ian, they're dead! What are you talking about?
Barb, Jill, they're dead, and I can't find Alice!
No! No! He's still out there!
Who?
Chucky!
Alice! Alice!
I gotta go find Alice.
Ian! What?
Ian, if you see Chucky, whatever you do, just leave him alone.
Chuck... What are you talking about?
Just stay away from that doll!
Alice?
Alice?
Ian?
Ian!
Ian!
(WHISPERING) Alice?
(ENGINE REVVING) Ian! (COUGHING) Ian!
Ian! (COUGHING) Ian!
(GULPS) No!
IAN: Nica!
No! Nica, what the hell are you doing?
He did it! It was him!
Nica! Look at me!
Give me the ax. What? No!
Give me the ax. What? No! Now, give me the goddamn ax!
Oh, my God. Nica, what have you done?
(SOBBING) Ian. Ian, please. You know I would never...
(SOBBING) Oh, my God.
(STRAINING) Ian. Ian. Take this.
I need you to inject it under my rib.
Ian.
Ian. Ian, what are you doing?
What the hell have you done with my daughter, Nica?
Ian, where's Chucky? You're sick!
Ian, I swear to God, I can prove it!
And so can I. (MUFFLED WHIMPERING)
Hey, Barb, check this out.
RadioShack, 450 bucks.
Oh, and by the way, if you're watching this, I put it on your MasterCard.
IAN: Where are you, Alice?
They'll never find me in here, Chucky.
This is the best game of hide and seek ever.
CHUCKY:  Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
Chucky, stop cursing.
(NICA YELLING)
Say hi to the little woman for me.
Maybe not.
Your turn.
My turn.
(WEAKLY) You're Charles Lee Ray.
My friends call me Chucky.
You're dead.
No, you are.
Why us?
Didn't your mother ever mention me?
I'm an old friend of the family.
Charles, come over here.
I wanna introduce you to someone.
SARAH: October 27th.
Okay.
Right against my rib cage.
Soon enough. Cannot come soon enough.
Charles, this is Sarah.
Hi. How do you do?
Her husband, Daniel. Hello, sir.
Hi, Daniel. Nice to meet you. And this is Barb.
She has her mother's eyes.
CHUCKY:  Such a nice, happy family.
But not for long.
You like 'em?
They're beautiful, thank you.
Difficult to find right now. They're not exactly in season.
Anyway, enjoy.
It's gettin' late, and I'm gonna go pick up Barbie at day care.
No!
I mean, shouldn't we have some time alone together?
What about family time?
Later.
Right now I want to have you all to myself.
(CHUCKLES) Sarah. Sarah, you've had me all day.
It isn't enough.
That's a selfish fucking attitude for a mother to take.
You don't wanna share me with her?
No. No.
Well, what's gonna happen when the baby comes?
Are you gonna keep her from me, too?
Are you gonna keep her from me, too? Because that would be very hurtful to me.
And you wouldn't wanna see me get hurt, would you?
Would you?
Would you? No. No.
I don't wanna see you get hurt.
I don't wanna see anybody get hurt.
Okay.
I'm gonna go get Barbie.
No! Please, please! Please don't.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
You told them about us?
There is no us.
Why?
Why would you want to destroy this family?
You destroyed my family.
No. (WHIMPERING)
I told you,
I've always had a thing for families.
No!
Especially kids.
You did this to me?
CHUCKY:  No, Nica, you did this to me.
You and your mommy.
She betrayed me.
Got me killed.
But I knew a way to come back.
Give me the power. I beg of you!
Took me 25 years,
but believe me,
it was worth the wait.
Twenty-five years.
Since then, a lot of families have come and gone.
The Barclays, the Kincaids, the Tillys,
but Nica, your family was always my favorite.
And now, you're the last one standing.
So to speak.
You know, you remind me a lot of Andy Barclay.
He was a whiny little bitch, just like you.
Did you kill him, too?
More or less.
I killed his childhood.
And the truth is, I killed you 25 years ago. Didn't I, Nica?
You haven't been living.
You can't call this living.
You've just been on life support.
Time to pull the fucking plug.
So you never actually killed Andy Barclay, did you?
What?
You know, it's called completion anxiety.
It's very common in males.
You are a male, aren't you?
I'm gonna kill you slow. (LAUGHING)
Yeah, no, I get that.
Twenty-five years. Must be the slowest murder in history.
I mean, what are you waiting for? A sign from God?
No!
You feel that, don't ya?
You wanna play, motherfucker? Let's play.
Police. Open up.
NICA: Help! Help me!
JUDGE:  Based on the evidence, the defendant
is declared legally incompetent
and remanded indefinitely to a facility for the criminally insane.
I'm alive, you son of a bitch. You hear me?
I'm still alive!
I'm still alive!
MAN: (ON ANSWERING MACHINE) Please leave a message.
Hey, it's me. I'm on my way. And don't forget my money.
They never learn.
So who's next?
WOMAN: Next.
Good afternoon.
Three-day, two-day, or overnight?
Overnight. It's extremely urgent.
Fragile?
Surprisingly not.
Approximate value?
Well, my mother always used to say you can't put a price on love.
Under 250, then.
Would you like to insure the package?
Oh, that won't be necessary.
It protects you and it protects the recipient.
I doubt that. (CHUCKLES)
Perishable goods? Live animal?
Just put "other."
Grandma, I'm home.
Grandma?
GAME SHOW HOST: And how are you today?
FEMALE CONTESTANT: Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.
GAME SHOW HOST: Feeling lucky?
GAME SHOW HOST: Feeling lucky? FEMALE CONTESTANT: Yeah. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
FEMALE CONTESTANT: Yeah. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) GAME SHOW HOST: Oh, that's great, Bunny.
As you know, Bunny has won 17,000...
Chucky, you found me!
I told you I would.
Where's Grandma?
In the cellar.
What's she doing down there?
Nothin'.
Chucky, Mommy and Daddy are dead.
Aunty Nica killed them.
But I'm your friend till the end, Alice.
And now it's time to play.
Hide-and-seek?
Hide the soul.
And guess what?
You're it.
Why do I always have to be it?
Because you're somebody that no one would ever suspect.
So tell me.
Tell you what?
About last night.
-I go to that new spot on Sixth and Main. -Right.
Nice atmosphere... -...beautiful women, Danny. -Shit.
Why say "shit"? I asked you to come.
I see this chick, cute girl, tight.
-Model tight? -No. No, no, no. I'm not fucking with them anorexic girls no more, dude.
No, no, no. I'm not fucking with them anorexic girls no more, dude.
-It's like fucking a bike with daddy issues. -True.
This girl, she's put together, man, I mean, nice titties, nice ass, whole package.
But I think I kind of know her.
Hey, my name is Bernie.
Good for you.
You know Angela.
-Yeah, I know Ang too. -Right, Bernie.
Yeah.
Yeah, you used to date Angela.
Date? No, I was fucking the shit out of Angela, that's what that was.
You got those edges nappy, huh?
So at this point, I'm intrigued.
Nothing makes a guy sexier than if he screwed over a chick you hate.
-It's like revenge by association. -Exactly.
So this Bernie's got a pair. It's ladies' night, I'm down, we get drunk.
-You buy? -Of course. Am I a dick?
She gets drunk, I get drunk, we go back to my place, right?
Listen to me, Danny, this chick was insane.
But he gets too drunk.
See, you always let them drink too much.
No. It is not my fault he got....
Whiskey-dick? Shame on you.
I had to keep up with her, or else I look like a pussy.
It's not my fault my friend couldn't keep it together.
Two ways to look at whiskey-dick.
The con is your dick is functionally dysfunctional.
The pro is your dick gets extra special attention for his extra special needs.
How much attention did she give you?
It was heaven. She was down there at least 20 minutes.
Any longer than that, you might as well charge.
So, I'm pulling out all the stops. I'm talking dirty, I do handwork.
I put on a goddamn slow jam. I mean, I am impressing myself.
I am like an EMT crew reviving a car crash victim.
Do you know what I mean? I'm like a hairdryer, I am blowing so hard.
But, I must admit, it was well worth the wait.
Really?
Impressive, but not threatening.
It's like the John Legend of penises.
-That is impressive. -Very.
So I'm down there and it is the....
-Best head this year. -What?
Thorough, paid attention to detail, took pride in her work, Danny.
Did she do your taxes as well?
Snarky, but I'll allow it. Only because you been crying...
...since Alison left you over a year ago.
-I'm taking my time. -Know what your problem is?
-I'm taking my time. -Know what your problem is? -You're too good-looking. -What?
Guys like me work harder than guys like you.
You guys don't appreciate the wealth of asses at your disposal.
Best thing that could happen to your face is an industrial accident. I'm serious.
You need to meet a nice-looking female...
...take her back to your place, turn her out.
-Make her feel things. -You made Joan feel things?
I made her feel like good and evil hung in the balance.
Like we were at peace talks and her orgasms were the end of genocide.
-I saved the world last night. -Appreciate it.
-I saved the world last night. -Appreciate it. You're welcome. Then she was like....
You're welcome. Then she was like....
And I'm like....
Stop. Stop, stop.
Yeah, I'm okay. Never mind, never mind, keep going.
Stop. Stop, stop. Stop, stop.
Motherfucker, I said, stop! Are you deaf, Negro?!
-And I'm like, "Well, bitch, which is it?" -I got a charley horse.
-Were your legs up around your...? -Obviously, which is so annoying.
-Were your legs up around your...? -Obviously, which is so annoying. Because I was just about to....
Come on. I'm like, finish your yoga so we can do it again.
Right, but the headline there is "again." -Yes. -We had to start all over.
-Yes. -We had to start all over.
If it was bad sex why are we hanging out with him?
It wasn't bad, it was imperfect.
-Isn't that the same thing? -Heads up, Miss Overachiever.
When it comes to sex, if you get it right the first time, you got nowhere to go.
Come on.
-Wait, there he is. -The other one's cute.
That must be his "this isn't a date" friend.
-Hey. -Come on.
-Hey. -Hey.
What's going on?
All right, well....
What do you think? It's a nice place, right?
It's okay. It's a bar.
Hey, if it's a bar, we supposed to be getting drunk.
As a matter of fact, this next round is on you two ladies.
Charming. This is my roommate, Debbie Sullivan.
How you doing? Bernie Litko.
-Good to meet you. -Hi. Nice to meet you.
This is my guy, this is Danny Martin. He works with me.
-Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.
-Hi, Danny. -Oh, shit. I'm sorry, Joan, this is Danny.
-This is who I was telling you about. -Heard a lot about you.
-So, what do you guys do? -Restaurant supply.
Exactly.
Sounds like you guys are either waiters or in the Mafia.
Sweetie, I'm gonna need you to take these unsolicited attacks down a notch.
Save the crazy for later, when I got use for that shit.
Okay.
Damn! Now, wait a minute.
Let me help you.
You see this shit?
-Got me one. -Okay.
Oh, thank you.
Okay. I'm gonna take it.
I want it! I want it!
-We gotta take another shot. -It's here!
Hey, come on. You sure you don't want another round?
-I'm fine, I got my drink. -Come on, shots.
-She never goes out unless I drag her. -That's not true.
It is true. She only sleeps with guys at her advertising firm.
-What? -It's so sad.
-She has to get it in at work. -Also not true. You're not by yourself. Let me tell you. He just as sad.
You're not by yourself. Let me tell you. He just as sad.
Yawn-fest over here ain't been out since his ex-girlfriend Alison...
Yawn-fest over here ain't been out since his ex-girlfriend Alison... -...broke up with him over a year ago. -Easy.
-...broke up with him over a year ago. -Easy.
He felt emasculated when she left him.
That happens a lot. Don't be embarrassed.
He should hook up with Debbie, and be boring together!
-Y'all should hook up and do this. -He should. Oh, yeah. I wanna do that.
-You wanna do that? -I wanna.
Let me tell you, we will never be boring.
-Me and you -Me and you -Will never be boring -Will never be boring
Public place. Get a room.
That's what I mean. Boring.
-I'm about to boo you. -It's okay, fine.
Baby, I'm gonna go to that place where you pee.
-Want me to go with you? -No, I'm fine, I'm fine!
I'm about to go to that place where she pees too.
All right.
Here I go.
Shit, yeah, I am.
Hey, hey. I'm sorry I said that shit about Alison.
-Just go. -I shouldn't have said that.
-Please. -I'm gonna beat this pussy up.
Go, please.
I'm not really boring.
Yeah, me neither.
I just pretend to be, so that she can be the crazy one.
This may be the worst date I've ever been on, and it's not even my date.
-I've definitely had worse. -Yeah?
Yeah. That's why I don't go out much.
Yeah. That's why I don't go out much. -It's not worth it, right? -Why even try something...
-It's not worth it, right? -Why even try something... ...when 95 percent of the time it's just an epic failure?
Because that other 5 percent can be pretty mind-blowing.
-Turn around. Put your hand up here. -I don't feel like a lady!
Listen. Listen.
-I'm a flower. -Okay, you're my flower.
Okay, you know what you're gonna do? You're gonna sit on me.
-That's it. I'm gonna sit on you. Okay. -Okay. Come here.
-Oh, my God, what is that?! -You flushed it!
You can turn that thing off.
It's work. I should go. I have to get up early in the morning.
Can I walk you out?
Yeah, sure.
-Are you serious? -Yep.
So, you lived in L.A. six years, and you've never been to a Dodgers game?
Nope.
I have killer seats. I'll take you.
Are you asking me out?
Yeah.
-Yeah. -Debbie?
Deborah Sullivan.
-Hello, Terrell. It's been a while. -Six months.
You're too good to return my calls?
Bitch move, Deb.
It's okay. He's taken one too many hits to the head, clearly.
-So this you now? -This is me.
Suit yourself. Life is short.
And so is he.
-He's corny. -Yeah.
-Remember that 95-percent epic failure? -Yeah.
-Exhibit A. -Really?
Yep.
I'm sorry, was that weird?
No, I'll be your fake boyfriend whenever you want.
But I wouldn't do this.
All right, so, what would you do if you were my boyfriend?
-It's nice, right? -Very, very.
What else?
Well....
I've wanted to put my hand here all night.
Then what?
Then I'd probably lean in, kind of like this.
You don't have to rush off.
Hi.
Hi.
I do, actually.
It's been a slice of heaven, really, but I have to go home now.
-Let me turn the light on. -No need to do that.
-Why? -It's a rule of mine.
You got a lot of rules, lady.
You need this?
There it is, yeah.
Thanks for that.
Should I walk you out?
No, we both know what happened the last time you did that.
That kind of makes me wanna walk you out even more, though.
Great. Thanks.
I can't believe I slept with him on the first date.
It wasn't even your date. It was mine. Tell me everything.
His eyes, his body, his mouth.
He didn't.
You lucky bitch.
-Bernie doesn't? -Of course not.
-Why not? -Well, you ask him.
Joan, where the bathroom at, baby?
Bernie? Why don't you like cunnilingus?
I don't even know who the bitch is. What are you talking about?
Hey.
I should go in there right now and force him to wear the thigh muffs.
Yeah.
Just remember, everything is covered under a full service warranty.
Food handler and VIP branch.
Temperature and cut resistant.
Hey, can I call you right back? Thanks.
-Yo. You cover for me with the Hobbit? -Yeah, I told him you went to the dentist.
-Brush your teeth to make it believable. -That's funny. That's real funny.
Hey, let's start this day off right.
'Sup, boy?
-I'm shaking your hand. -Why?
Congratulating you on growing your dick back. You banged Debbie.
How do you know this?
I banged her this morning. I'm wearing the same stuff.
-I'm lying, dude. Our girls are roommates. -She's not my girl.
-You want her to be. -She's not.
Look at me with your blue eyes, tell me you don't want her to be your girl.
I just met her. It was nothing but about last night.
-Text her? -I don't have her number.
You'll get it. After that nasty stuff you did last night, she'll find you.
Hey, what do you think of her?
You just didn't care, now you wanna know what I think?
I think she looks good, I think she's smart. Dude, straight-up wife material.
Or she could be Alison all over again.
-I'll pretend you didn't say that. -I'll act like I didn't see you check...
-I'll pretend you didn't say that. -I'll act like I didn't see you check... -...your Facebook for friend requests. -Hey, buddies, dudes, compadres.
-...your Facebook for friend requests. -Hey, buddies, dudes, compadres.
Corporate office guys are here. Did not buy the dentist thing.
-Should I tell them you were...? -I was eating pussy all night, Keller.
Wow, hey, nice.
-Why is corporate here? -Asset review.
They just showed up. I was like, "What, no phone call?"
They were like, "If you try to be funny again... ...we're gonna rip your throat out." Which is, like, so them, you know?
...we're gonna rip your throat out." Which is, like, so them, you know?
-Bernie, you're prepared, right? -Sure am, boss.
-Bernie, you're prepared, right? -Sure am, boss. -Let's do it. -Follow you, my fearless leader.
-Let's do it. -Follow you, my fearless leader.
Go get them.
-Really? -Clean it up, bitch. Stop, I'm playing.
About Summer
Debbie, are you with us?
-Did you? -Yeah.
Where you going? Are you gonna go see your little fuck-buddy?
-Hey. -I'm serious, don't go. Okay?
If you stay, I'll let you see the taint.
-No. -I wanna show it to you.
-I gotta go! -You gonna go look at Debbie's taint?
-Yeah, it's much better than yours. -James has seen my taint! You saw it.
Bernie!
-It just depends on your monthly sales-- -Bernie.
-Where's Danny? -I don't know, ask him.
-I would if I could find the man. -Debbie, where are you?
I need one more teeth-cleaning for my log.
Hey, if you're with Danny, don't brush after.
I need a challenge.
Okay, that's enough. I will hurt you in this chair.
CASEY'S IRISH PUB
-There you go. -Thank you, Case.
Thanks again for covering my ass, Danny.
And I'll get you the last two months next week. I promise.
Don't take this the wrong way, I'm just curious.
Why can't you pay? You got customers.
-Yeah, everybody's inside drinking. -Doesn't mean they're paying.
Why? Are you running tabs? What is this, 1978?
What can I do? They're my regulars.
-Get them MasterCards. -It's tough times now.
-It's not your problem. -It is my problem. They're my friends.
You gotta start looking at these guys as your customers.
-Damn sure do, Case. -That's your problem.
What is with you? Did you get back with Alison?
-Fucking a new chick. -Happy for you. Not for nothing...
-Fucking a new chick. -Happy for you. Not for nothing... ...when you were with Allison, you weren't the coolest guy to hang around with.
...when you were with Allison, you weren't the coolest guy to hang around with.
Just saying. Thanks again.
-Hey, you going to the movies tonight? -I don't know.
Are you coming to the movies tonight...
-...or are you gonna flake again? -I don't know. Why? Is Danny coming?
You two should go out in public together instead of being vampires.
I've never done a serious relationship thing, but I smell "not ready" all over him.
Well, maybe you're not sniffing in the right places.
Hello?
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother you.
You were the only house with the lights on. I just lost control of my car.
Whooped your ass, boy. And I gave you a head start.
Why you bail on Saturday?
-I was busy. -Writing in your diary?
If you don't wanna deal with Debbie, stop putting your parts in hers.
-Do you have a problem with that? -Actually I do.
You're not the one getting an earful from Joan. I am.
Nothing is more unattractive than your friend dicking over her friend.
-I'm not dicking Debbie over. -Doing the fuck-buddy dance.
-What? -The fuck-buddy dance.
When you do that dance, somebody gets hurt.
Nine times out of 10, the person with the vagina. I won't fraternize with the enemy.
That's the stupidest thing I've heard you say.
That's the stupidest thing I've heard you say. It's not stupid. You know what this is? It's the Lando Calrissian effect.
It's not stupid. You know what this is? It's the Lando Calrissian effect.
I'm out here getting pussy in Cloud City giving Han Solo a run for his money.
When they find out I'm friends with Darth Vader...
...I'll get stuck in the Millenium Falcon...
...with the racially offensive copilot. It's the Star Wars equivalent to castration.
-Either get in or get out. -Fine...
-...but I'm not the bad guy. -You will be.
-...but I'm not the bad guy. -You will be. You will be.
-Danny. -Hey.
Hi, stranger.
Told you I had great seats.
Yeah, these are great.
For you.
-Oh, thank you. -Yeah.
-There you go. -Look good?
Now you're ready. Look at that.
Can't we move closer?
We could, but these are my seats.
Yeah, but those can be our seats.
Well, it doesn't really work like that.
Why, are there seat cops?
These are my dad's seats.
He inherited them from his dad, so it's a thing.
Yeah. You get it, right?
Yeah, I get it. I do.
-These are great seats. -Good.
-Where's Joan? -She's gonna meet us here.
-Where's Joan? -She's gonna meet us here. -Where's Bernie? -He said he's gonna meet us here.
-Where's Bernie? -He said he's gonna meet us here.
-Right. -Right.
Wait, so do they know we set them up?
Yeah, baby. I mean, they ain't stupid.
I know they're not stupid. I just.... I want them to work it out.
-Are you serious, we still need these? -Yes.
-When's the last time you got tested? -I don't know. I was in college.
College? I am tested every year at my Pap smear.
-You need to get tested. -Okay, first of all...
-You need to get tested. -Okay, first of all... -...do I wanna know what a Pap smear is? -No.
-...do I wanna know what a Pap smear is? -No.
-Take the test, I'll take the test. -Thank you.
-Wait a minute. Give me a second. -I'm....
That's it, it's on.
Wait, wait, no, it's not.
-See, this is what happened last time-- -It's on. It's on.
-See, this is what happened last time-- -It's on. It's on. -Are you sure? -I'm pos-- I know when it's on.
-Are you sure? -I'm pos-- I know when it's on.
Now that I got this big old gift wrapped, let's get it going while the tree is still up.
All right. Get on top.
-I'm not getting on top. You get on top. -I got on top last time. I won't get on top.
-No, that shit fucks with my knees. -But my back is bad.
-No, that shit fucks with my knees. -But my back is bad. -Rock, Paper, Scissors, loser gets on top. -Fine.
-Rock, Paper, Scissors, loser gets on top. -Fine.
-On three. Ready? -Okay.
-One, two, three. -One, two, three.
That's a tie. We gotta go side. Lift your cheek up.
There you go, there you go, baby. There it is.
That's what I'm talking about, baby! Good defense, boy!
Nice play, get him at third, get him at third! Got him!
-Did they win? -What?
-Did they win? -No, it was just a great fucking play.
Didn't you see?
No, I blinked, and then something made you dance.
That's the thing about this game. You gotta stay in the moment, right?
You can't worry about what's gonna happen, right... ...otherwise you're gonna miss....
Miss the best part.
You know, she just needs a little-- Wait, push!
-Move your leg! -Push!
I'll make a deal. You can talk if you put the pillow under your stomach.
-Okay. -Put it under your stomach.
-Right there. Don't move. -I got it, I got it! That's it!
-That's it. Game over. -That's it!
Casey's -Dad brought me here after every game. -To a bar?
-Dad brought me here after every game. -To a bar?
Casey's is more than just a bar. I mean, just look around. It's rich.
-Is there another room? -Stop, stop. Stop.
This place is like a second home to me. I've been coming here since--
You could wrap your chubby fingers around a baseball.
-You used to be chubby. So cute. -No, he's just--
That's really cute.
See, that's an entirely different story. All right, I gotta go. I'll be back.
Sorry, pal.
-You and his dad still friends? -No, he fucked me over.
Died of bone cancer 20 years ago.
-Were you guys close? -Yeah. My best friend.
Really?
What?
-Nothing. -What?
-Nothing. -What? -Just interesting. -What's interesting?
-Just interesting. -What's interesting?
Danny has never brought a lady into this bar before.
Really? I'm the first?
-Swear on Jackie Robinson's grave. -Another first.
Well, that was good. I like that.
Wait. Wait, wait.
-You need to stretch or something? -This isn't just sex, right?
Well, this is technically sex, babe. Yes.
There's a couple variants of this theme we could do, but it's sex.
I know, but we mean something to each other, right?
Yeah. What-- Like, yes.
So am I your girlfriend?
Damn!
Yeah, you my girlfriend.
-Really? -Yes.
And you feel something for me?
Yes.
-You do? -Yes.
-You feel it? -I feel it.
-You feel it? -Oh, God.
I feel something. Hit me again, baby.
Bitch! What? Knock your damn head off! That's my ear!
-You told me to hit you again. -I didn't say hit me hard like that!
-You called me a name. You yelled at me. -Didn't mean it like that. You hit my ear.
-I didn't know-- -I can't hear you!
-I didn't know it was your ear! -Say it in the other fucking ear!
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hit you! I'm upset!
-Right. Goddamn. -Okay.
-Call me your girlfriend again. -You're my girlfriend.
-Give me a kiss! -You keep yelling at me.
-You're my girlfriend. -I'm your....
I'm your girlfriend!
So is it true?
Is what true?
You've never brought a lady there before?
He told you that?
You're the first.
So, what now?
-When's your birthday? -December 5th.
-Parents still together? -Divorced when I was 13.
How about you?
It's just my mom.
She's in D.C. She's a retired schoolteacher, so....
-Only child? -Yeah.
Why do I feel like I'm being quizzed...
...and if I get something wrong, we're gonna break up?
Did you just confirm that we're dating?
I let the cat out of the bag.
I think the cat's been out of the bag and wandering the room for some time now.
I love this.
What annoys you most?
Amusement parks.
What? Do you also hate America?
I can't stand the concept of organized fun.
You know, it's like, have fun now. You know, do it now.
Like New Year's Eve.
-Resolution now. Better life now. -Absolutely not. New Year's is awesome.
-Resolution now. Better life now. -Absolutely not. New Year's is awesome. You're just stupid.
-What? You're stupid. -Your face is stupid.
-Your penis is stupid. -My what?
-Your penis-- -Is what?
I can give you a hand.
-I love this movie. -Yeah, I love this movie too.
-You like chick-flicks? -It's not a chick-flick. It's a dude's movie.
-Chick. -Dude.
-Chick. Chick. Dude. -Dude.
-Chick. -See?
Shit. You fucking-- Okay, okay.
I see.
I don't want this to end.
I hate Sunday afternoons.
It's like, countdown to reality.
I normally play marathon sessions of All-Star Battle Royale.
I usually masturbate and watch old episodes of House.
Yep.
-That's good. -You like that?
I don't even want to check my phone.
Fuck it. We'll do it together.
Count of three.
One, two, three.
-Shit. -Shit.
Bernie Litko is an asshole. And I liked him. I really liked him.
I was so into him. And now I hope he gets hit by a car...
...and doesn't die, but his dick gets paralyzed...
...and he can only have sex through a series of hand signals.
Slow down. What happened?
Excuse me. You can't drink in here.
Alcohol only after 6 p.m.
-Isn't it after 6 p.m. in Korea? -I don't know.
I'll call my grandmother in China, ask her if she knows any Koreans.
-Nice. -Bitch.
-Did she just call me a bitch? -Stop it.
-He broke.... -Up with me.
-Get out of here. -Here's the thing.
I explained to her, technically we're not boyfriend and girlfriend.
So technically you can't break up with me.
She give a reason for not technically breaking up?
She's a woman, Danny. I mean, she bitched about a few minor things.
See, my parents....
--are coming to town, and I want to meet them.
And he's like, "No way."
And I'm like, "Why not?" And he goes, "Because you're not Jewish."
-He's.... -Jewish? How did I not know that?
A, because I'm not. And B, because when you and I were fucking...
-...you never asked to meet my parents. -True.
And so what? I dropped the Jew-bomb.
She can't say anything about it. If she does she's racist.
Bernie, dropping the Jew-bomb after months of fucking her? -Real mature. -Don't do that, Danny. Don't judge me.
-Real mature. -Don't do that, Danny. Don't judge me.
I like Joan. I think Joan is great in bed.
I think the girl's ass should be worshiped by indigenous peoples.
When you talk about girlfriend, boyfriend, and meeting parents, it's exit time for me.
Weren't you the one that said get in or get out?
Part of getting in is knowing when to get....
You're not listening.
I had to break up with him because I'm not Jewish.
What kind of weak-ass man--?
-Hold up. You said he broke up with you. -He did.
I did the only thing a red-blooded woman can do in that situation.
I forced an ultimatum. You choose me, or you choose your family and heritage.
And he chose 3000 years of beautiful tradition.
Can you believe that asshole?
-How's Bernie? -Fine. How's Joan?
-Fine. How's work? -Good. You?
-Great. -I'm hungry, woman. Let's go.
There it is.
You could really use a dining room table.
Oh, my God. Someone stole my dining room table.
And a dining room. Holy shit.
I'm serious. What do you do when people come over?
-I don't have people over. -Hello. What am I?
-I don't have people over. -Hello. What am I? -Special. -Thank you.
-Special. -Thank you.
Come here.
I thought about you all day.
-I thought about me all day too. -You're such a dick.
Been wearing that backpack for longer than three weeks now.
You're officially a lesbian.
Some of us don't live here, or roll out of bed looking perfect.
You do.
-Thank you. -Good morning.
-Good morning. -Coming back tonight?
I gotta go by my place first, get some more clothes for tomorrow.
You coming back tomorrow night? And the night after that?
Yep, I am. Why? What's wrong?
-Well, you're just always here. -Okay.
So leave some stuff. Take a drawer.
A drawer?
A whole drawer for little old me? Really, Danny?
-Yeah. -You sure? It's kind of a big deal.
Keys. A drawer and keys?
Somebody pinch me. Really.
-Keep talking that shit... -Really? ...and I will make sure you are late for work.
You know what? I knew it. I knew it.
I knew this would happen. I knew you would move in with this guy.
I feel that adults don't have roommates. They live with their significant others.
So, I am now suddenly a child because you found a guy you think you like?
-No, but Danny and I talked about it-- -For what? Five minutes in bed?
I'm giving you two months' extra rent until you find someone.
I didn't think you were one of those girls who drops her friends...
-...the second she gets regular dick. -Nice. Let me get this straight.
I finally meet someone that I really care about...
...and you think that I should force a breakup...
...sit around stuffing my face, and complain constantly.
-I'm down if you are. -If you want your 30s to be...
-I'm down if you are. -If you want your 30s to be... ...a blur of parties, punctuated by teeth cleanings, that's great.
...a blur of parties, punctuated by teeth cleanings, that's great.
I want something different. That means being spontaneous.
You know what? You are such a wild card.
That's why you're packing a week before the U-Haul gets here, huh, Deb?
Great. You know what? Go, go! Just go!
I give it two months.
Three, tops! And this is my shit, damn it!
I said, get in or get out. I didn't mean put a loaded gun to your head.
-There's nothing loaded-gun about this. -What?
We're great together. This is just the next step.
Off a cliff? It's not funny, man. Like you're laughing.
You think it's free blowjobs for the rest of your life?
Is that what you're thinking? That's not the case, man.
You don't get it. Your life is over.
No more going out all night. You understand? That's done.
One-night stands? Over.
Yo, do you hear that? I hear something. Where's it coming from? I don't know.
Oh, it's coming from right here. It's the nail hitting the damn coffin.
You don't even get it. Your life is over, dude.
I know she just saw me. Hey, sweet pea.
Excuse me?
Don't call me sweet pea.
And also.... Fuck off.
All right, babe. I'll just....
Wipe that damn smirk off your face.
You'll be me in T-minus-two months. You hear me?
-Right on. -Will you stop with the hands?
What's your problem?
Hey, Joan, listen.
-I know this must suck for you-- -Bite me.
-Blow me. -See what I'm saying?
-Blow me. -See what I'm saying? -I ain't never disrespect you like that. -Joan.
-I ain't never disrespect you like that. -Joan.
Miss that? Miss it like having a growth removed.
I wanna talk to you, man.
All that stuff that I was saying to you about her potentially being Alison....
I didn't mean it. I see a difference in you.
And I feel like it's because of her. I'm kind of, like, jealous. A little bit.
-I'm really happy for you, Danny. -Really?
Fuck, no. This is stupid.
"Really? Are you really happy?"
I think it looks pretty. Pillows are pretty. And curtains, and--
We don't need curtains. We have shades.
-No. Decorative. -I don't need this many pillows.
-We do. -I wanna get rid of all of them. See? What are you doing? Okay. All right.
See? What are you doing? Okay. All right.
About Fall
-What have you been up to? -Do you like it? I mean, if not...
-What have you been up to? -Do you like it? I mean, if not... ...the salesman said I can send it back.
A dining room table?
Yeah. Just in time for Thanksgiving.
-Thanksgiving? -Yeah.
I was thinking we could invite some friends over for Thanksgiving dinner.
Since we're cohabitating now.
It's my favorite holiday.
So, what do you think?
Do you like it? Be honest.
-You did great. -I did?
-You did really great. -I did, didn't I?
Hope you're hungry. I ordered a large pizza. Pepperoni.
Okay.
How long ago did you order this pizza?
Why?
Wondering how much time we had.
Oh, my God. Where is he? I'm starving.
-There he is. -Perfect.
I'm hungry as a motherfucker. Let's go.
-Looking for these? -Yeah.
-Yeah. -No, you don't need them.
-Go to the door naked? -Go like that.
-Go to the door naked? -Go like that. Pizza's getting cold. I won't answer the door naked.
Pizza's getting cold. I won't answer the door naked. -Underwear, please. -Come on, I dare you.
-Underwear, please. -Come on, I dare you.
-You what? -I dare you.
-You dare me? -Double dare.
-You double dare me? -Yeah.
-For real? -Yeah.
Shit. All right, woman.
No, wait! Wait, wait. Let me see.
-Come on. -I like looking at you.
I appreciate it. Thank you. Can we eat tonight?
Okay, fine.
You throw like a girl.
-I'll get the plates. -Yeah.
Alison
What is it?
I forgot we have the same phone.
Listen.
She has a psycho antenna that tells her, "Somewhere out there, Danny is happy.
And I should swoop in and blow it all to shit." I just ignore her.
But you're not ignoring it. You're letting it ring.
See, if I ignore it, it goes straight to voicemail.
And then she knows I ignored it. Then she sticks a pin in a voodoo doll.
Wait a minute. People know when you hit the ignore button?
-Yeah. -No one ever told me that.
You're such a fucking nerd.
We don't need to make this about us.
This is just Alison being crazy.
I moved in after a 10-minute conversation.
We gave it our best shot. You're right.
We gave it our best shot. You're right. -Just call U-Haul-- -You never said you wanted this.
-Just call U-Haul-- -You never said you wanted this.
I just spent a week rearranging my life and moving you in.
-Does that not say I want this? -Are we fighting?
-Does that not say I want this? -Are we fighting? -Is this our first fight? -Yeah.
-We're coming out of the gate strong. -I need to hear you say it.
-I wanna do this. -Why?
I want, like, a home.
I haven't had one in a long time, and you being here...
...makes this place a home.
-That's so amazing. -Yeah?
-Can we always be honest like this? -Absolutely.
What level of honesty would you prefer?
"I don't like it when you play Rihanna music" honest?
Or "I imagine a threesome with you and Rihanna" honest? I'm good either way.
God, I love you.
I love you too.
I'm gonna get those plates.
No, no, no, Danny!
-Who said it first? -She did. But she didn't meant to.
Women approach that phrase with the strategy of an anti-terrorist strike team.
-It was an accident. -It was no accident.
-It was an ambush. This was definitely.... -The worst thing you could do.
-I didn't plan. It just came out. -It's a disaster.
Let's go to his place, move your stuff out, start a new life in another state. Disappear.
Join Witness Protection. You're fucked.
-Is it that bad to be the first one to say it? -Yes! Know why?
-Why? -In every relationship everywhere...
...there is a person who cares more than the other person.
-And whoever says "I love you" first.... -Cares more.
That other person's gotta match that level of caring.
Which is impossible, because she will always care more.
Now you're saying things like, "I don't know if I feel the same way."
You're saying we should have just counted to three...
You're saying we should have just counted to three... ...and said it at the same time?
That's not what I'm saying, Ike. When you were with Alison...
That's not what I'm saying, Ike. When you were with Alison... ...who said "I love you" first?
-Shit. -Exactomundo, man.
-Hey, daddio, we didn't order these. -They did.
-Them bitches over there? -Yep.
-I love Halloween. -I love Halloween.
I hate Halloween.
Who are you, by the way? What's your costume? Are you Rod Stewart in drag?
I'm Tina Turner. It makes more sense when I stand next to Danny.
Right, like that's not a metaphor for something.
There they are. I only regret that he didn't let me clean his teeth.
I bet that fucker's like the Sistine Chapel of hardened plaque.
Divide and conquer?
Let's do it.
All right, so let me break it down for you. The slutty angel, she likes anal.
And the slutty nurse likes to say "Daddy" while she's having sex.
-That's her thing. -No shit.
And the slutty nun.... Oh, it's on with the slutty nun.
Well, here's to another night of sexual perversity in Los Angeles.
Wait, no, I'm not toasting with you to that.
That's not your world. You're banished into the world of couples' costumes.
That's right. I don't know anything more emasculating than that.
Who are you supposed to be? Aren't you cold?
I am Channing Tatum. Channing Tatum never gets cold.
Cheers.
-Ike, baby. -Hey, how's it going?
I gotta meet a client in the morning, so I can't stay too long.
Oh, baby, it's a holiday. You gotta work tomorrow?
It's a kids' holiday, and grown-ups have to work tomorrow.
That's a great attitude. Why don't you tell him there's no Santa?
Aren't you Jewish?
Who are you waving those singles at?
There ain't no magic in that mini-Mike.
-See what I'm talking about? -Take your little drink. Get on the way.
-See what I'm talking about? -Take your little drink. Get on the way. -I have this. -What is she...? Joan!
-I have this. -What is she...? Joan!
You better not.... Hey, Joan!
-What did you just say to them? -I just told them you gave me herpes.
That I have.... I don't have fucking herpes, Joan!
Promise me we'll never end up like them.
All's fair, Bitchko. What are you gonna do, cry about it?
Yo, you are sick. You're gone. If you didn't have a pussy...
Yo, you are sick. You're gone. If you didn't have a pussy... ...there'd be a bounty on your head.
-Can we go home now? -Little mama, let's split.
You are a psychopathic social misfit...
...who's clearly in the middle of a deep homosexual panic.
If I'm gay, it's only because after fucking you for three months...
...that seems like the next logical step!
I would rather chase another man's ass than fuck you again, Joan!
-Homosexual panic. Homosexual panic. -That's a panic? This is a panic.
-You got no idea what I'll do to you. -Better make it count...
-You got no idea what I'll do to you. -Better make it count... -...because you won't get a second one. -You make me mad!
-...because you won't get a second one. -You make me mad!
I hate your guts.
-Get away. You get away. -You better lose my number. You lose it.
I'm gonna lose the memory that you ever lived!
Security!
Security!
Hey, dude, when I tell you last night got crazy....
You remember the slutty chicks, right?
We start doing shots. We do, like, fucking 16 shots, back to back.
You should've stayed instead of leaving... -...like a little whipped punk bitch. -Yeah, I'm super jealous of you right now.
-...like a little whipped punk bitch. -Yeah, I'm super jealous of you right now.
-If you're gonna scream, don't talk to me. -I'm talking normally.
-I don't need to party. -Okay.
-I can have an enjoyable night at home. -Gonna sell me on that shit?
Keep on talking, sell me on it.
-Debbie has this thing-- -Shut the hell up. I don't wanna hear it.
-Debbie has this thing-- -Shut the hell up. I don't wanna hear it. Give a shit about that. Your life at home with Debbie. I got a hangover.
Give a shit about that. Your life at home with Debbie. I got a hangover.
Feel like a bunch of bees stinging me in my face. Daniel Martin, please, come to my office. Daniel Martin.
Daniel Martin, please, come to my office. Daniel Martin.
Am I a lost kid at Chuck E. Cheese? Why does he insist on using that?
Hey, buddy. This is Mr. Savelson, Mr. Greenberg from corporate.
They're here to talk to you about your accounts.
Specifically Casey's, and how he hasn't...
...paid us.
That's it. Should be one, two, buckle my shoe.
So let's huddle up. We'll have a nice little chat, mano-a-mano...
...a-mano-a-mano. There's four people in this scenario.
They can't cut me off.
I've been giving them business for years.
-I always pay eventually. -There's no more "eventually."
-I always pay eventually. -There's no more "eventually." I'll talk to them. They can't do this to people.
I'll talk to them. They can't do this to people. There is no "they." It's a gigantic company. I don't even know who my boss' boss is.
There is no "they." It's a gigantic company. I don't even know who my boss' boss is.
They don't care about you...
...or your bar.
What about you, Danny?
Do you care?
-Hey. -Hey.
-Don't forget about the thing tonight. -Oh, shit, Debbie.
You said you'd go. -I want you to meet the people I work with. -Fine.
-I want you to meet the people I work with. -Fine.
But I'm inviting Bernie!
Fine. Then I'm inviting Joan.
-Fine. -Fine.
-Fine. -Fine.
-Fine. -Fine.
-Fine. -I heard that.
Hey, man. Thanks for showing up. Anytime. So, dude, what are you, like, auditioning for her co-workers right now?
Anytime. So, dude, what are you, like, auditioning for her co-workers right now?
-I'm supporting her. -Financially?
-Is that what you're talking about? -Actually, no. I mean...
-Is that what you're talking about? -Actually, no. I mean... ...she might make more money than me.
She might make more money than you? What are you--?
You know she makes more money than you. Stop it.
You know what you are in this picture? Okay, let's say her life is like a bike, right?
Dude, you wouldn't be the tire, you wouldn't be the handlebar.
You wouldn't even be the damn seat. You know what you would be?
You'd be the little bell on the front of the bike.
The bell that people ring to let people know they're coming.
-Yeah. -"Here I come. Look how perfect my life is."
That's what you would be. A fucking bell.
Oh, my God. Hello. Sweetie, I'm talk-- Okay.
-Lesbian. -I don't think so.
I can't stand stuff like this. Everybody walking around with their nose in the air.
Bunch of rich people with attitudes.
These are the type of people Debbie's hanging around with.
These are the type of people you have to hang around with...
...to continue to be that little bell on her bike, man. Food for thought.
Hey, is that Joan right there?
Yeah, I'm gonna leave you to it.
You look good, Joan.
By good, I do mean tremendous.
-I was thinking-- -You were thinking?
-Shouldn't do that, you'll hurt yourself. -That's what I miss. So damn feisty, Joan.
Bother some other girl.
Maybe I don't want to bother some other girl. Maybe I want some feisty.
Here you go.
A rum and coke. Light ice, though. I don't like a lot of ice.
Bernie, this is....
I'm sorry. Your name is escaping me...
I'm sorry. Your name is escaping me... ...because I'm distracted by how straight and white your teeth are.
...because I'm distracted by how straight and white your teeth are.
Derek, like Jeter.
-Right. -Yeah.
Derek, this is Bernie...
...like Madoff.
He has gingivitis as a result of not flossing enough.
-What's up? -The hell do I do with that?
-Normal people shake it. -I'm not normal.
Bernie's gonna go to a shitty dive bar now...
Bernie's gonna go to a shitty dive bar now... ...and pick up some chick with low self-esteem.
No, I'm gonna go home.
The only chick with low self-esteem that I wanted tonight...
...is you.
Look, I'm telling you.
You wanna clear 400 K at the end of the year without lifting a finger?
You invest. Passive income. That's how you're gonna pay your taxes.
Danny, what do you do?
Honey, he wants to know what you do.
-Restaurant supply. -Interesting. In what aspect?
-Restaurant supply. -Interesting. In what aspect? I work.
Active income. It's kind of a cause-and-effect thing.
You work, someone pays you for the work.
It's an experimental thing a few companies are trying.
-Danny's a salesman. -I can see. I mean...
...he's really selling me on something.
-So how did you and Debbie meet? -We're cousins.
Danny.
Hey, I'm just trying to make conversation.
Okay, chief. Don't let me stop you.
Excuse me for a second.
What the hell was that?
That was Steven, wiping his dick with money...
That was Steven, wiping his dick with money... ...that could save people's businesses.
-That's what it was. -Why are you angry?
-That's what it was. -Why are you angry? -I'm not angry. -You call this calm?
-I'm not angry. -You call this calm?
My boss is not why you're mad. You're scared about something.
My boss is not why you're mad. You're scared about something. -I'm not scared. -Talk to me.
-I'm not scared. -Talk to me.
I hate my job.
It means I have to do things that I know aren't right, and I hate it.
-Then quit. -I can't.
-Why not? -Because I have you now. I can't do that.
I appreciate you wanting me to follow my dream, baby, but it's just unrealistic.
If you're doing this job for me, you're doing it for the wrong reasons.
-You say that, but you don't mean it. -How do you know?
You're a well-put-together person, and you want me to be a part of all that.
-No, I-- -This shit isn't pretty, all right?
You'll run when I can't be what you want!
I'm not Alison!
Hey, buddy. You wanna sit down?
I'm not really good at communicating, except with my Japanese love-doll.
-There goes my sense of humor again. -Right, right. What's up, Keller?
So since....
Two weeks after our meeting with corporate, a delivery went out to Casey's.
It's probably a computer glitch or something.
Nope. No, I actually authorized that delivery.
Right. Okay.
Well, since you violated and misappropriated company materials...
...I'm gonna have to....
You know....
Because you.... You leave me no recourse, Danny.
-Danny.... -I'll tell you what. -I'll make it easier on you. -Come on, Danny.
-I'll make it easier on you. -Come on, Danny.
Danny, don't be mad. What are you doing? Are you mad at me?
Where you going, man?
I'm walking out. That's what people do when they quit.
-You can't quit. -Oh, yeah? Watch me.
-Hey, can you hold that for a second? -Yeah.
Oh, shit.
-What? -Thanks. I'll see you later?
-Yeah. -All right, cool.
-You can't quit, because you're fired. -Go fuck yourself.
-You're still on for the company picnic? -Sure am. Yep.
There you are. Baby, you were right.
Just screw that place. I quit.
Good for you.
What's going on?
-We were being careful. -We are. I switched birth control--
-We were being careful. -We are. I switched birth control-- -Wait, we haven't had sex in forever. -We had sex three days ago.
-Wait, we haven't had sex in forever. -We had sex three days ago.
-Wait, we haven't had sex in forever. -We had sex three days ago. -Used to have sex every day. -It takes two people to have sex.
-Used to have sex every day. -It takes two people to have sex.
-What's that supposed to mean, Debbie? -Nothing. I'm not pregnant.
Thank God.
Wait, are you disappointed?
Look, Debbie. I just quit my job. I'm not--
-I'm relieved. I'm relieved. -Yeah?
Good.
-So now we got two reasons to celebrate. -Yeah.
-Yep. -You want a beer?
Love one.
Cranberry sauce, onions for stuffing.
Is Bernie coming tomorrow? Because I should warn Joan.
-I'll ask. I'm gonna see him tonight. -You going out tonight?
Yeah, it's Trent's birthday, we always go out. I didn't tell you that?
No, no. It's fine.
It's a tradition, you know? I mean, we do it every year.
We can still see our friends outside of each other, right?
Of course.
Why are you...?
Are we arguing?
No, we're talking.
You don't want me to go out?
No, do what you wanna do.
You don't want me to go out the night before Thanksgiving.
No, baby. I'm just confused. Okay?
You said that we were gonna make Thanksgiving dinner together.
It's my favorite holiday.
This is not a problem at all. Tomorrow morning we will wake up...
This is not a problem at all. Tomorrow morning we will wake up... ...we will whip up something special. I'll make sweet potato pie. Okay?
...we will whip up something special. I'll make sweet potato pie. Okay?
...we will whip up something special. I'll make sweet potato pie. Okay? It's still gonna be your favorite holiday. We're gonna do it together. Okay?
It's still gonna be your favorite holiday. We're gonna do it together. Okay?
It's still gonna be your favorite holiday. We're gonna do it together. Okay? -Thank you. -Are we making up?
-Thank you. -Are we making up? -We weren't fighting. -Make up anyway?
-We weren't fighting. -Make up anyway? Lay it on me.
Look. Look at all the doggies.
-Can I hold it? -Of course.
They need good homes.
Oh, baby, isn't he cute?
Yeah, he's adorable. Look at you. You're a little Chewbacca.
This is our dog. You wanna be our doggie?
-Our dog? -Wouldn't it be great?
Walks in the park, snuggles.
Baby, you know, they chew stuff up, they poop on floors.
You're just gonna let him kiss you in the mouth, huh? Just, wow.
It's a lot of responsibility, baby.
Thank you.
-What's wrong? -Nothing.
-What happened? -Nothing.
-Come on. Just tell me. -I feel ready, but you don't, so we aren't.
-It's cute. -It's cool.
Cool.
Now we are arguing.
-Hey, should we get a dog? -Collectively, as a group?
-I'm allergic. -I like Rottweilers.
I won't get a dog. Trent wouldn't take care of it.
-What do you mean? I love dogs. -I'd be stuck cleaning up shit.
-What do you mean? I love dogs. -I'd be stuck cleaning up shit. -I'm not cleaning up dog shit. -Debbie, the woman I live with...
-I'm not cleaning up dog shit. -Debbie, the woman I live with... ...is interested in procuring an animal for us to domesticate.
...is interested in procuring an animal for us to domesticate.
-Isn't she too busy domesticating you? -Is it that bad?
Yes, it's that bad. Dude, your balls are in your goddamn vagina.
-Dogs are practice babies. Don't do it. -I have an idea. How about you...
-Dogs are practice babies. Don't do it. -I have an idea. How about you... -...get out of there? -I can't. I live there. It's my place.
-...get out of there? -I can't. I live there. It's my place.
Wait, I got it. Fake your own death.
-Drop the Jew-bomb. -I'm not Jewish.
Details. Everything with you is about details, Danny. Just lie.
Casey, put it on my tab, huh? Good night.
Hey, real quick. Before you go, sir. Trent, that's your future.
Probably.
-Okay. Good night. -Hey, be safe, man.
Danny, watch the bar. I gotta put this highly functioning citizen into a cab.
Yep.
Casey! You see me right here, you couldn't choose me?
Danny back there is like a fox in a hen house!
What you assholes want?
-Some 1800. -Two beers.
I like the towel on your shoulder. Like a matador.
I learned the tricks of the trade from the legendary drunks. Hemingway...
I learned the tricks of the trade from the legendary drunks. Hemingway... -...Bukowski, your dad. -My dad now.
-...Bukowski, your dad. -My dad now.
Any job that lets me drink you under the table is fine.
-What'd you say? -That a challenge?
-Possibly. -Know what? I might just meet you halfway, my friend.
I might just meet you halfway, my friend.
Tomorrow's a holiday. I don't have shit to do.
-Where do we hang these? -Here.
Isaac, stop asking dumb questions, man.
Let's do this.
Do it! You better fucking do it!
Fuck you!
Go, go, go!
All the way. All the way. All the way!
-What time is it? -Almost noon.
Shit, Deb, listen. I'm really sorry. I didn't--
Can you get the turkey out of the oven? I think it's done.
What can I do to help?
You can take the turkey out of the oven. I think it's done.
Okay.
And you can be unequivocally supportive of everything I do...
...for the next 24 hours.
Oh, boy.
-Bernie! -Hey.
Give me some. Happy holiday, boy.
Look at her ass.
Hey, this is my new love, Tracy. I got you.
That bitch looks like Tracy Morgan.
I got you.
-Does she have my fucking dress? -Let me get that. Gobble, gobble.
Did she just say enchanté?
-Baby, let me introduce you. -You didn't tell me she was coming.
This is my new love, Tracy. Tracy, meet the guys.
Nice to meet you.
She's not French. I can't take it.
Dude, how long y'all been here?
An hour.
-Thank you. -Game's about to come on.
Go, boy! Go, boy!
This could be a good year for them.
This bitch is on my last nerve, I swear. Here, take this.
No, I'll just get paranoid.
Right now paranoid would be relaxed for you. Here.
I think her butt is fake. It looks like a pad.
-Do I seem different? -You just had one hit.
-Do I seem different? -You just had one hit. No, no. I mean, in general.
It is a little weird that everyone's having a great time.
Especially Bernie. You're acting like a rodent on crack.
Danny said he'd help, but he got drunk.
So I had to do this entire goddamn spread.
-I'm prettier than her, right? -I'm overworking myself...
-I'm prettier than her, right? -I'm overworking myself... ...not expressing my feelings, and becoming my mother.
...not expressing my feelings, and becoming my mother.
If this bitch was any dumber, you'd have to water her.
Oh, God, it's worse than that. I've become the person who says things...
Oh, God, it's worse than that. I've become the person who says things... -...like "becoming my mother." -You're officially high.
-...like "becoming my mother." -You're officially high. Give me that back. I gotta go handle some shit.
Give me that back. I gotta go handle some shit.
Danny. Can you make sure people use the coasters?
Should I enforce this policy with an iron fist?
Whatever you think is fine.
Wait a minute. Baby?
Are you stoned?
No. Yes. A little. My forehead weighs so much right now.
You know what? I gotta liven this party up. Come here, baby.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to take this time to make a toast to Danny and Debbie.
Without them, we'd be celebrating this holiday with binge drinking and weird sex.
Keep on drinking, people. Could still get lucky.
-Some of us have standards. -Sorry, what did you say, Joan?
-Some of us have standards. -Funny. Some of us are living proof...
-Some of us have standards. -Funny. Some of us are living proof... ...that if you get drunk enough, standards drop.
...that if you get drunk enough, standards drop.
-Obviously. I fucked you. -Fucked?
You called it fucking? I didn't.
-Don't treat me like some random chick! -You better control it.
-No, you control it. -You control it. Stop it.
-You control it. -Don't.
-Excuse me, what is your name? -I'm--
Exactly. No one cares. Because you are making a brief cameo in a very tragic porno.
-Joan. -You and I. We meant something.
You felt something, Bernie. You cried during sex with me.
I challenge any man in this room not to cry when they have sex with you.
Stop it, okay? I don't have time for this shit.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Sorry, baby.
Bring it over here.
Debbie, Danny, this is what you have to look forward to.
-Joan, no, no, don't. -I am leaving!
-I'm leaving! -No, I am!
-Stop. -Your date's here!
-Kiss my ass! -Leave me alone.
-Tracy. -Joan, don't go.
-Tracy. -Joan, don't go. I'm storming out dramatically. Get your coat.
I'm storming out dramatically. Get your coat.
I'm leaving! You ain't gonna leave before me!
-No, no, no! -Yes, yes, yes!
-I am leaving! -Get off the door!
-Get off the door, Joan! -Not your door! I open my own door!
You don't even know how to open a door!
-Don't close it on me! -Don't you-- Get away!
-Fuck you, Joan! -Fuck you, Bernie!
-Fuck you! Fuck you! -Fuck you! Fuck you back!
Fine! Go, go! Tracy, will you, please?
-Shut up! Shut up! -You shut up!
Hey, Danny. This was a great time, man. Thanks. All right?
Save me a plate.
Holy shit.
-That's not good. -Frosting, anyone?
Hey, what happened? I had this horrible nightmare...
Hey, what happened? I had this horrible nightmare... ...that we had friends over for Thanksgiving.
Yeah, it was a nightmare. But you weren't dreaming.
-Where are you going? -I gotta run out.
Oh, my God! Hi, puppy!
Danny, you got him.
-Yeah. -Hi.
Hug Mommy. Hug me.
Baby.
He needs a good home, and we have that now.
-Yes, we do. -Yeah. Thanks to you.
Hi!
He's just like a little baby.
Yeah. He's awesome.
-Why don't you pick the damn dog up? -I can't. He's gotta learn to walk.
Tell him to sit so you at least look better. You look stupid.
-Pacino. -Thanks for your time.
You have my résumé.
You're doing good. Come here.
-Good luck out there. -Yeah.
-What do you think? -Oh, my God. What a surprise.
-What do you think? -Oh, my God. What a surprise. Hello, beautiful. Come here.
Oh, he's adorable.
-What's his name? -His name's Pacino. Pacino, this is Casey.
Hey, you talking to me? You talking to me?
-That's De Niro. -I'm De Niro talking to Pacino.
-Come on. -Right.
Yeah. Casey, listen, I could use a favor.
Name it.
Hey. How was your first night bartending?
Fine, fine. I thought you'd be sleeping.
Yeah, my flight's at 7. I figured I'd stay up, sleep on the plane.
I wanted to see you.
Yeah.
You're only going to Chicago for two days.
I think we can go two days without seeing each other.
Yeah, but it's your first night.
You know what, Debbie? It's just an in-between thing...
...until I find a better job, okay?
You don't need to make a big deal out of it.
Okay.
What are we fighting about now?
I don't know. You tell me, you're picking one.
No, no, no!
Bad dog!
Damn it! My best shoe.
Why are you packing those? To look nice for Steven?
Don't throw that in my face... -...just to make yourself feel better. -I just wanted to come home...
-...just to make yourself feel better. -I just wanted to come home...
...watch Sports Center, drink a beer, and go the fuck to sleep.
-Are you storming out now? -I'm going to Joan's.
-I'll see you when I get back. -Why do you get to walk out?
Because this is your apartment, moron.
Did Mommy just call me a moron? I don't know what to do. Should I call him?
I don't know what to do. Should I call him?
I don't wanna leave angry, but I am angry.
And if I pretend like I'm not, just so we get better...
...the entire thing is gonna start all over again.
Am I boring you?
It is 5:30 in the morning.
Only Starbucks employees and babies are up at this hour.
I am exhausted and, yes, you are boring the shit out of me.
Just really want this to work, and I feel like he's giving up.
Which only makes me work harder, and then I become the bitch.
Which only makes me work harder, and then I become the bitch. -Who's texting you at this hour? -No, you don't want to know. It's fine.
-Who's texting you at this hour? -No, you don't want to know. It's fine.
-What should I do? -You want my advice all of a sudden?
You moved in with him, despite all of my excellent advice not to.
You have my permission to move out if that's what you want.
-Is somebody here? -My new roommate.
-Is it a guy? -Basically.
-Basically? -After you abandoned me...
-Basically? -After you abandoned me... ...I had to replace you.
-What's up? -Hi.
That bitch just took my last soy milk.
I hope she remembered to lift the toilet seat.
Please, come back, Deb.
Please.
So whether in L.A. or here in Chicago, with Near Field Communication...
So whether in L.A. or here in Chicago, with Near Field Communication... ...you can take the music from your phone, and just like that...
...you can take the music from your phone, and just like that... -...little tap, right in your ear. -Oh, yeah.
And just like that...
...from your phone to your speaker.
Three Olives on the rocks.
-Hi. -Alison.
I just got back from Paris. I was hoping I'd run into you.
Just not behind the bar.
What happened? I hope this has nothing to do with me.
-You are the cause of all things. -I know.
We can be friends, though, can't we?
I could really use a friend right now, and a drink.
Put your money away.
You look great.
So how have you been?
Living the dream.
Well, I can tell by your cold and distant demeanor...
-...you must be seeing someone. -Yeah, yeah.
-Debbie. -Oh, Debbie.
That's cute. It's so high school. Are you guys going steady?
I got other customers, Alison.
I'll be right here.
Thanks for the drink.
Is your suite on this floor?
No.
Stop.
-He won't know. -I would.
-Not like you have a ring on your finger. -I don't need a ring.
-Not like you have a ring on your finger. -I don't need a ring. Look at me. Don't I look different? I'm crazy about this guy.
Look at me. Don't I look different? I'm crazy about this guy. -I live with him. We have a life together. -Does he love you?
-I live with him. We have a life together. -Does he love you?
If he doesn't, he's an idiot.
Hey.
You talking to me?
I forgot what a nice guy you can be.
Yeah, I hate that about me.
-Good night. -Night.
I don't know where she lives now. She won't tell me. Should I put her in a cab?
-You can't put her in a cab like that. -Okay, so, what should I do?
Put her on a train.
Kidding.
We can't leave her here like that.
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, I got you.
I love it when you take such good care of me.
-That's what I do. -This reminds me of the old times.
-Really? -Yeah.
Okay. Do me a favor. Just sit right here.
Yes, I will sit.
That's how you want me?
-Don't start. -You want it on the chair?
-You want us sitting? -Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah. -Damn.
Okay, all right. Yeah.
-I'm gonna go away right quick, okay? -Okay.
-That's great, you just hold onto that. -All right.
-Be right back. Stay right there. -I'll be right here.
You have a puppy?
Hi, puppy. So cute.
Pacino.
Sorry about that. Here's some water.
-Water? -Drink that. L.A. tap.
Pacino, come here. Good boy.
-I'll be right back. -Be right here.
It's all right, kid. I'll get her out of here. I'll call her a cab.
Right? Then I'm gonna jerk off like I do when Mommy's not here.
And sometimes when Mommy is here.
-Hi. -Hi.
-You moved. -Yeah.
-I just wanted to be more comfortable. -Right, okay.
It's a nice couch.
This Daisy girl really has changed you, Dan-Dan.
It's Debbie. And she hasn't changed me.
She makes me wanna change myself, all right?
She pushes me. It's good.
-You like to be pushed, don't you? -It's different with her, Alison.
Right. All right.
Oh, my God. No, this is not good.
Shit, fuck. Jeez.
Know what? You should go. That would just be better.
Someone wants to play hard to get.
You're crawling. Okay.
Come on, Dan-Dan. Give me a chance to do right by you.
That's exactly what I'm doing. Trust me.
-Are you sure about that? -Yeah.
-Yeah? -Yeah, I'm sure.
Well, somebody else is telling me something very different.
Yeah, don't listen to him. He gets me in trouble every time.
Here is your coat and purse.
Here's cab fare.
You'll regret this when you've got two kids and you live in the suburbs...
...but I wish you well.
Call me when you're feeling horny.
What upsets me most is not that I had Alison over...
...or that she wanted my junk like never before. It was crazy, dude.
But, you know, I have now become that guy who cares about the damn coaster.
On top of that, I have to hear Debbie's mouth about it.
I'd rather lick Pacino's ass before I heard a woman's mouth over some coasters.
You wanna lick my dog's ass, pet him first.
Boom! Suck on that, StankbudNYC! Right between your eyes, bitch.
What? What'd you say?
That's real funny. Know what else is funny?
The fact that you haven't seen a live actual vagina.
Yeah, I have. Sucks to be 13, doesn't it? Whatever. Scoreboard, bitch.
Hey, what am I supposed to do?
-What you do is play your side! -I got it. Stop yelling.
-Get in the bunker! -I'm in. Just relax.
What do you do? Shouldn't love handle this? Love and your practice baby.
Seriously, you're like a gay couple staying together for the damn dog.
Pause it. Seriously, my phone. Pause it.
Who you texting?
So nasty. Nobody. I just gotta send something.
Hey, let me see, man. What'd she send you?
Come on, let me just live vicariously.
I know you got photos in there. She sent you pictures?
I know you got photos in there. She sent you pictures? -None of your business. -Let me see.
-None of your business. -Let me see.
-I can't let you. -Nice tits?
Stop being weird. Seriously.
She got nice titties. I knew it, man. Let me see.
-You're freaking me out. -Let me see.
It's my phone. Stop.
I'm not letting you-- Danny, get off the phone, man!
The first picture's my dick.
-Where? -Right there, man.
Give me my phone.
-You sleep with her? -No.
-I'd rather you tell me if-- -I said, no.
-Did you want to sleep with her? -If I wanted to, I could have.
About Winter
Bitch, did you send me to ignore?
I've earned a courtesy ring through to voicemail.
I miss you. Come out. Call me.
Sorry.
Wow, are you serious right now, Danny?
That was such an obvious ignore-button move.
Dude, where are you? Like, you're officially MIA right now.
Come be a friend. Come get shit-faced with your boy. Bye.
Fuck him. Merry Christmas, bitches.
To you and me. To us.
To a new year together.
-Yeah? -You still grounded?
Tell the ball and chain to lighten up, and get over here!
-Funny guy. -It's New Year's, bitch!
Talk to you later.
-Bernie? -What's left of him.
-Everyone at the Broadway? -Sounded like it.
-Let's go. -Go where?
To the Broadway. Let's go.
-Are you sure? We have this-- -Yeah, we should have some fun.
I need some fun.
I'll walk Pacino.
Here, boy.
Broadway bar
Hey, Danny!
-Over here! -Bernie!
Come over here! I got shots for you over here!
Come on this side! Hey, mother--
Look, I got it. I'm good. I'm all right!
-What's up? -What up?
Here. Make you all right. Come on.
-Yes, sir! -Hey, Bernie!
Hey. Hey, Deb.
Happy new year.
Slow down, man! What are you doing?
-Today's a holiday, baby. -No, no, no.
I only paid for one. Hey.
-Danny. Okay, okay. -Happy new year!
All right. Okay, slow down.
-Danny, I'm going to the bathroom. -What?
I'll be right back.
I love you too.
Hey, cowboy, what's up?
-Did you just get out of jail, man? -Basically, yeah.
All right, look, slow down, okay?
No, Danny. For real, slow down.
Danny. Danny, look at me. That's like four in a row, man.
One more round! Let's go!
-You didn't drive? -No.
You ain't gonna get all crazy in here. Take this. There you go. Right there.
-What is that? -A hangover patch.
-Awesome! -Okay!
Happy new year!
Debbie! Oh, my God!
I can't believe you're here! This is so great.
I can't do this. No, listen. We'll go, we're gonna find Danny, and then--
No, listen. We'll go, we're gonna find Danny, and then--
Danny just wants to be with his boys.
I don't even know why I'm here.
This isn't fun anymore.
So we'll make it fun, Deb.
I'm done, okay?
I'm calling a cab.
-This is gonna be my year. -Right. Yeah.
-Stop. I don't like that. Stop. -Danny, I'm going home.
Wow, Joan, you were right. Your friend is boring.
Hey, don't call my friend boring, dick-breath.
-Whoa, Joan. -Damn it, Joan.
-I was just joking. -Okay.
Shouldn't you be arguing with Bernie? It's what you guys do best.
-Don't disrespect me. I'm not doing-- -What?
Why you gotta throw me under the bus?
-For no reason. -My bad.
Deb, listen, we just got here.
It's a party. It's a celebration. It's New Year's Eve.
Are you coming, or what?
I really don't wanna spend tonight of all nights...
...doing what we're gonna be doing all next year.
Fighting.
That's my cue.
No. No, Debbie, no!
-Fuck. Fuck, I fucked that up. -Fucking wonderful, asshole.
You fucked that up, I'll be the first to tell you that.
-I'll see you later. -Yeah.
-What was that? -They getting good at that arguing shit.
Yes, I mean, that was some legendary Olympic 100-meter hurdle shit.
-Hey, we gotta step our game up. -Absolutely.
-We have to after that. -Yeah.
-Nine, eight, seven.... -Here we go.
-Six, five, four... -Deb! Deb!
...three, two, one!
Happy new year!
Happy new year.
Listen to me. I can't stand your goddamn guts, girl.
It's the new year. Give me a wet kiss. Let me get one. Come on.
That's what you do?
-Was it wet enough? -It's just like your damn nasty tongue.
-Jerk. -Happy new year, motherfucker.
-Jerk. -Happy new year, motherfucker. Happy new year, asshole.
I'll be back tomorrow for the rest of my stuff.
Please, don't be here.
Honestly?
For a stupid New Year's Eve party, Deb? Come on.
No. And you know it.
So why don't you just say it?
-I'm not happy. -Yeah.
That's been completely obvious since Alison.
Stop acting like I cheated on you. I never cheated on you.
I didn't realize it was such a sacrifice for you.
You think you're the only one who turned down sex from their ex?
So you're not happy either?
Why should we still try and do this?
Because I love you.
And just because shit is fucked up right now doesn't mean you stop trying.
-Deb. -Did you ever love me?
Or was it just some really long one-night stand?
I don't know.
God.
Let me see.
Is there anything else she wanted me to pick up?
Dining room table, sorry excuse for a man?
Nope. She specifically said she didn't want that shit anymore.
And by the way, I know this sucks for you.
-I feel really bad. -I bet you've been waiting a long time...
-I feel really bad. -I bet you've been waiting a long time... -...to say that. -Way too long.
-...to say that. -Way too long.
I'm so happy to have my old roommate back.
...don't floss after you eat all that.
You want another one?
-What did you just say? -Want another beer?
-What? -I'm asking you if you want a drink.
Why are you here checking on me? Why'd you leave them?
-I'm working, they're good. Want a drink? -See what's down there?
-Yes. -Are you sure?
-Yes. -Are we looking in the same direction?
-Yeah, we are. -What are we looking at?
Five pieces of pussy. That's what we're looking at. And you check on me?
What do you want me to do? They're my customers.
-Debbie-whipped! -I'm uncomfortable.
Like being pussy-whipped, except with one specific pussy!
What do I want you-- I want you to fuck these bitches, Danny! Damn it, man!
If you don't go down there and talk to these women...
...I swear to God, we are no longer friends. We are no longer friends.
Now either you talk to them, or you give me your face.
Danny Martin Friends Unfriend
I was only promoted because of this man right here.
Threw his job away on a dream and a prayer.
To Danny, for dropping out, so idiots like me can get ahead.
To Danny!
-Hey. Sorry about that. -What a cute dog.
-Thanks. -He must take after his daddy.
-I can't. -What?
I'm thinking of someone else.
You're really....
Nice.
Have a good evening.
All I'm saying is you can't be so picky. I mean, no one is gonna be Danny.
-You had Danny, now you don't want him. -When you had it good...
-You had Danny, now you don't want him. -When you had it good... ...even if it went bad, you can't go back to faking it.
Honey, I get it. I get it.
-Are you seeing someone? -No, why?
I don't know, it just looks like you gained some relationship weight.
So you didn't close? You leave a classy chick like that hanging?
No, man, classy? I picked her up at a dog park, man.
I'm sorry, Danny. Did I miss the wealth of black-tie events you've been attending?
-What are you talking about? -I don't know what happened.
Look at me. You gotta move on, man. That's crazy.
Yeah. You know, speaking of which, should I go before Keller gets back?
-No, you're fine. -Sure?
Yes, you're fine.
Hey, you know I could probably get you your job back here.
-Now I've got string-pulling abilities. -I'm good.
I can tell you're good. Pass up perfectly good dog-park pussy.
Hey, there is something you can do for me.
If you're willing to pull those, you know, strings.
-What do you need? -What is that?
Puppets. Strings.
Puppet master. That's puppets....
Controlling it.
-You need some ice, don't you? -No, I....
Amanda, be a doll, please, and bring a cup of ice in here and some napkins.
Thank you.
Moving up in the chain.
Casey's
-You got something to say? Say it. -All right.
Thought about doing a little extra with this place?
You say karaoke night, I'll punch you in the face.
Okay. Like, turn the courtyard into a beer garden.
Maybe get some patio dining going. Expand the menu just a smidge.
Of course I've thought about it. Know what it costs to do that?
-I have some savings. -Yeah.
Bernie can help out on the supply side.
Take out a second mortgage on this place, put some real money in here.
You're talking like you'll stick around for a while.
-And if I did? -I'd call the bank today.
-Call the bank. -Oh, yeah.
Bernie. Come on, man, we gotta get this stuff to the bar, baby.
Can't steal shit without the puppet master.
Bernie?
Oh, shit.
-Making that thing cluck, ain't you? -Sorry, man.
What you doing? Why you stopping?
-Sorry. -Oh, Danny Boy. Fuck a baby.
Yo, is it 3:00 already?
-Hey, man, close the door! -Yeah, right. My bad.
On the other side, you asshole!
-Let me finish. -We're not finishing!
What you mean, we ain't? We gonna finish.
-There it is. Erection gone. -Why didn't you lock the door?
You show up with a chicken mask!
You want people in here while I'm wearing a chicken mask?
Baby, calm down.
-You told me you want to fuck a chicken! -Joan?
Hey, man, close the damn door!
Are you gonna stop?
Are you gonna let me explain myself? I'm serious. Can you stop?
Look, I didn't say anything to you because this little situation...
...works for us, man.
Dude, you have no idea how sexy this shit is.
We treat each other like shit in public, but then out of nowhere...
We treat each other like shit in public, but then out of nowhere... ...we turn around and fuck like porn stars.
I mean, there's so much built-up tension and energy, man.
Why do we have to do what everybody else does?
I mean, I feel like we could have a relationship without all that bullshit, man.
We didn't get it right the first time. So what? Fuck it. Honestly, fuck it.
Who says that we even gotta get it right at all?
I mean, if you take away all the conventions...
...being in an honest relationship... ...is the most freeing feeling in the world, man.
...is the most freeing feeling in the world, man.
I can be me by just being me, and she can be her by just being her.
And when I'm with her.... Oh, my God.
There's no place else I'd rather be.
When I'm not with her, that's the only place that I wanna be.
You get it? Like, do you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Yeah, I've been there, brother.
It's mind-blowing.
That's why I don't like to talk to you, you get all sensitive and shit.
Hey, let me get two Stranahan's. Neat, please.
I'm fine. I don't need no tap.
I'm good.
I'm Bernie, baby.
You know me.
I love you.
Yeah.
HDMI, right?
Hey, here we go.
Great play.
Not the same as being there.
No, it's not the same.
Nothing is.
Super casual. Come on, Danny, relax.
Deborah Sullivan.
Hey, stranger. How's it going?
I really need an assistant.
What's that?
You know, I kind of can't hear you. I guess I got bad reception in here.
-Let's just talk over lunch. -You're not serious.
Yeah, I am.
Okay, look....
These last few months have just been miserable.
I can't stand going out...
...or being at home...
...because, you know, that reminds me of you.
I can't sleep.
Pacino can't sleep.
Everything's just kind of falling apart, Deb, and....
Because I miss you.
I need to see you.
Actually, I want to see you.
-If you just give me one more chance... -Danny.
-...I know I can-- -Danny. Danny.
-I gotta go. Bye. -No. No, no, don't--
About Spring
-The hemiparesis is on the affected side. -That's correct, the left side.
Which then is consistent with....
No! What are you doing?
Your first vacation in three years, and you spend it with Hugh Laurie.
He's the only person in the world who understands me. He's really smart.
You know why, Deb?
Because Dr. House knows something that Debbie Sullivan has yet to discover.
-What? -All the answers in the world...
-What? -All the answers in the world... ...won't solve your problems.
Call him.
You know you want to.
And also...
...I'm seeing Bernie again.
-I know. -How?
Come on. I'm depressed, I'm not stupid.
CASEY'S Irish Bar & Grill
Yeah, baby.
Don't hurt it.
I got it.
Heaven.
Eureka.
This looks great. You guys really went all out.
-Thank you. -Well, it's a very special evening.
Are you pregnant?
What? Hell, no. Come on, don't you say no shit like that. Come on, Deb.
I mean, if you wanna have a baby, I'm for what you want to do.
So don't ever think that's in question.
So are you coming to my birthday dinner next week?
-Yeah. Is Danny coming? -He won't be there, Deb.
-Yeah. Is Danny coming? -He won't be there, Deb. -Invite him. It's his best friend. -Me? Friends?
-Invite him. It's his best friend. -Me? Friends? No, I don't have no friends. You don't even know that about me.
No, I don't have no friends. You don't even know that about me. I don't believe in friends. Only thing I believe in is Joan...
I don't believe in friends. Only thing I believe in is Joan...
...and whatever mystery's lying between those legs of hers.
-My God. -You look so good in this light.
Don't you get in no trouble on this table.
-Stop it. Stop it. -Don't get in trouble. I'll take it.
Anyway, it is my birthday, and what I say goes. Right?
Obviously. That's done. You know I'm on board with that.
The phone. I'll get it.
-Got it, baby? -You guys start. Yep. It's fine.
-Girl, you look good. Real good. -Bernie, stop it.
This looks so good.
-Shut up. Girl, look at me. Get the bag. -What's this?
Listen to me. The food is vile. Hear me? The bitch cannot cook.
Whatever you do, do not swallow the fucking food.
What you do is this. You wait till she not looking, spit it in the bag, get low.
Put it in the fucking bag. Throw that shit in the trash.
Do it fast. The food eat through the bag, she'll smell it.
You're not listening. You don't give a shit. I gotta die for it, you don't have to.
You on your own. I tried to tell you. Here she comes. Put the bag down.
Telemarketers.
-Oh, God. -Awful.
They ring and ring. Babe, you didn't eat.
I'm waiting on you. Won't eat without my baby.
Can you believe this one?
-Here, take some. -Before we do that...
-...let's do the thing before we eat. -What thing?
-It's time for our special announcement. -It is.
I would like to take this time to propose a toast.
Now, I don't know to what extent you and Joan have talked about...
...the magic that's been going on in our relationship.
-Magic? -Let him finish. He wants to do this.
Baby, that's not true. I don't want to do it.
I'm doing it because we agreed I'm better at it.
-No, we didn't. -Yes, we did.
-No. -You're worried about how she'd take it.
-I said it's about the presentation. -No, I said because I'm the one with her...
-...I see her upset and crying all the time. -Baby, that's a lie.
-You talked about she'll slit her wrists. -Hey, hey! I'm moving out.
-Okay? -No.
-Yes. -Yeah.
-Yeah. -No. No. What?
I found a place. I move out end of the month.
-You're not mad? -Of course not.
Thank you so much.
Because if you were mad at me, I would totally understand.
Because I gave you so much shit about moving in with a guy.
And then I have Bernie move in.
We were together longer than you and what's-his-name. Not technically.
We were together longer than you and what's-his-name. Not technically. -We were together a lot longer. -It was on. It was magic.
-We were together a lot longer. -It was on. It was magic.
-And we were happier. -Their shit was fucked up.
-I said in the beginning it wouldn't last. -We had over and under.
Crash and burn. Crash and burn. That's what we called them.
Oh, my God.
Okay, I get it. It's cool, just didn't think you were one of those girls...
Okay, I get it. It's cool, just didn't think you were one of those girls... ...that drop your friends the second you get some regular dick.
...that drop your friends the second you get some regular dick.
You got me.
Back up. Regular dick? Ain't nothing regular about my dick.
My dick is completely irregular. -Let's set that record straight. -You got him started.
-Let's set that record straight. -You got him started. -I give it two months. -Hey, before we drink...
-I give it two months. -Hey, before we drink... ...what are we talking, with you being out?
-No rush. -But let's put a number to it.
It's the 10th, so 13....
-This month has 30-- -Thirty-one days.
-That'll be crazy. -If it's 13, it's okay.
-To you guys. -Thank you.
Oh, man. Butt-naked, running around the house.
It's on! It's on!
Your food should be right up, all right?
How was he?
-Great. -Hey, buddy. Hello.
He's getting really strong. He pulls a lot. You should get him a harness.
Will do, will do. Thanks for taking care of him.
Sure. I mean, it's my job.
-So, I'll see you Tuesday. -Yeah. All right.
Nice dog walker.
Hey. Danny Martin, professional friend.
What you gonna do? You coming to the Broadway bar?
Yeah, I'm just right around the corner, man. I gotta walk Pacino home.
Hurry up. Tell him Scent of a Woman came out on Blu-ray.
That always makes him take a shit when I walk him.
Pacino!
Hey! Pacino! Pacino!
Out of the road, asshole!
Hey.
Hey.
He's so big.
Yeah, he's all grown up now.
Yeah. I'll say.
I hope to be just like him one day.
-You going to Joan's? -Yeah.
They told me you weren't coming. I wouldn't--
No, it's cool. I'm sure they couldn't resist.
-You think? -Yeah.
I mean, old habits die hard with them.
You look good.
You too.
And Pacino looks handsome and happy.
He's doing all right.
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy.
I was just gonna take him for a walk around the park.
You wanna...? I mean, I'm sure Pacino would want to spend some quality time.
Yeah, sure.
-She's not responding. -I think he's gonna flake on me too.
-Do they know we set them up? -They're not stupid.
-I take that back. Danny is slow. -Debbie ain't no rocket scientist.
Danny might be the dumbest person I've ever met.
That bitch barely thinks. I think she spells her name with one B.
Dumbass couple.
Stupid as fuck. Right?
That's why I feel so bad, because who else is gonna be with them?
-They're dumb. -That's true.
Two people that dumb gotta stay together.
True. It takes us down, hanging around them the way that we were.
I felt that. I felt muted. My whole time, I felt like I thought for her.
Crazy, I had the same thing. I remember one time Danny was talking.
Crazy, I had the same thing. I remember one time Danny was talking. -I look at him while he talk-- -I daydream when Debbie talks.
-I look at him while he talk-- -I daydream when Debbie talks. -Something else is going on. -That's what I do.
-Something else is going on. -That's what I do. -Ignorance. -And that is why I feel awful.
-Ignorance. -And that is why I feel awful. I mean, you know, they keep avoiding each other.
-Yeah. -Dodging each other. -They were so in love. -That's how it is sometimes.
-They were so in love. -That's how it is sometimes. -You know that. -I know, I hate--
-You know that. -I know, I hate--
-Happy birthday! -There we go.
Wait a minute, is this cake chocolate?
Chocolate cake, chocolate icing, chocolate filling.
-Yeah, but I'm allergic to chocolate. -I know.
I fucking love you.
Did you just say "I love you"?
-No, I didn't finish my sentence. -Yes, you did.
I said "I fucking love." I was about to say something on the back of it.
-Bernie, you are such a girl. -Whatever.
-Bernie, you are such a girl. -Whatever. -I do love you. -Better love me.
-I do love you. -Better love me.
You can break my heart if you want to. Love you too.
Listen. I am....
I'm sorry...
...for everything.
-Truly. -Me too.
And I'm glad you're doing so well.
You too.
I think we're just gonna stay in tonight...
...so you should go have a good time with Bernie and Joan, and....
I think I will.
Do you wanna...
...go out sometime?
Yeah.
Yeah. We should catch up.
We're gonna do once more around the block.
Do you wanna join us?
Yeah, I think I will.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Pacino, let's go.
-Let's make a toast. -What are we toasting to?
-To Danny and Debbie. -Okay.
May we never end up like them.
-Okay. I'm not trying to do that. -That shit is jacked up.
-I'd take you out. -Oh, yeah.
I'd cut off your oxygen, that shit happen. Make you suffer.
-You gonna cut off my oxygen? -Don't fuck with me.
-Take your lips off, feed it to the dog. -Take your teeth out one by one.
-I'll cut your nipples off. -I'd sew your balls together like one.
-I'll cut your nipples off. -I'd sew your balls together like one. -You'll have one nut. -Leave me with a punching bag?
an assassin called Battosai, or "Pure Drawn Sword,"
roamed the streets of Kyoto, terrorizing the shogunate forces
roamed the streets of Kyoto, terrorizing the shogunate forces with cold-blooded, almost supernatural strength.
The "Boshin War" brought Japan to the verge of its modern age.
JANUARY 1868
THE BATTLE OF TOBA-FUSHIMI
There! The Shogun's men!
Battosai the Killer!
Where are you? Where are you?
Saito! The shogunate dog!
Ready!
Come on, Battosai!
We've won!
It's the Emperor's banner!
You are now rebels against His Majesty!
We've won!
So it's come, has it?
The new age...
At last.
Battosai!
It doesn't end here.
Though the world may change,
men like us...
still live and die by the sword.
Why?
Why have I been left alive?
This sword...
Could this belong to Battosai?
TOKYO, 1878
General Yamagata will speak!
Salute!
As you were!
Over the past ten years,
Japan has taken the Western powers as an example
and walked a new path.
The new government's authority has spread far and wide,
bringing our land prosperity and security.
The age when fear and violence held sway is over!
Salute!
People are weak.
They pay lip service to fine ideals,
but there are three things for which they become beasts.
For themselves, for money...
and for pleasure.
Excuse me.
You've done it.
Good job, Megumi.
Thank you.
This new type of opium will turn people into animals.
You may go.
We only need one person who knows the process.
Eeny, meeny,
miny, moe.
Which one will it be?
Let's let God decide.
Thank you!
Damn it!
-Hey! -Move!
Come on!
Let him go!
Leave him...
to Battosai.
Toasted dumplings! Get them while they're hot!
-One, please. -Welcome.
JUSTIFICATION FOR EXECUTION
He was an undercover officer.
A warning.
Battosai the Killer again? Why does he leave these things?
It's not him.
The "justification" should say why you've killed someone.
This doesn't.
It's not Battosai's style.
Huh?
"Battosai the Killer"?
"Of the Kamiya School"?
"Kasshin-ryu style"?
You!
The edict says no swords and you've got one.
You're Battosai!
Your evil deeds end here. Ready!
Whoa! Wait!
I'm not him!
Your humble servant is naught
but a poor wanderer.
You believe me?
Then why do you have that sword?
This is a back-blade.
-A "back-blade"? -See?
The cutting edge is on the back.
The opposite of a normal sword.
That won't kill...
No.
I thank you.
Who is that man?
He claims to be from my fencing school. He kills people and leaves letters.
Just like in the old days.
Huh?
Sir!
A visitor.
I'm surprised a police officer would come calling alone.
Care for one?
What's that?
Someone calling himself Battosai has killed an undercover officer.
The ghost of a samurai comes back ten years later as a murderer?
-Your Shinbashi warehouse-- -That warehouse?
We're not using it right now.
We wanted it for imported goods, but things haven't worked out.
If you really want to search it, there are procedures to follow.
Officials can no longer do as they wish in the new age.
Don't push me.
That ghost may not realize times have changed.
Food!
Look at that bunch.
Former samurai cut adrift in the new Japan.
I've hired them to keep them from starving.
They're men who can fight. Left alone, they'd cause chaos.
You never know what a hungry dog will bite.
But looking at you,
I'd say you used to be a samurai, too.
-I still am. -That's why I don't like you.
Careful.
They say cops wait for evidence, but I don't.
Sir! Megumi's gone!
What? She got away?
We've got a cop on the take.
He says a woman came to them for protection.
Damn that woman!
Don't worry about it.
If she talks about the opium, she's guilty, too.
Once a woman falls that low, you never know what she'll do.
How would you know?
What?
-I know women! -You!
Shut up!
That woman...
Get that woman back here right away.
Hands off!
What do you want?
I'll do her.
Don't kill her, Jine.
She's the only one who knows how to make Spiderweb.
Do what you have to.
Battosai.
Look, you came to us.
Tell us what's going on.
I give up.
What's happening?
-That way! -This way!
This way!
-Which way? -This way!
-Move! -He's over here!
Battosai?
Come quietly!
What happened?
Who are you?
Don't move! Halt!
This isn't magic.
It's a technique.
My sword-spirit uses your fear to paralyze you.
It's called "One Side of the Soul."
Can't breathe?
The more you fear, the worse it gets.
A cat!
Hi, kitty!
Hey...
Stop!
PORTRAIT
You're Battosai?
Why are you doing evil in the name of the Kamiya School?
It's because of you...
that the school my father left me...
Your father? What about him?
He taught that fencing...
celebrates life.
The sword is a way of life...
not death.
A woman challenges me with a wooden sword?
Quiet!
This stick won't help you.
A sword lives on blood.
Die knowing that.
You forgot this.
Who are you?
Whoever.
Are you the man who calls himself Battosai?
Those scars...
That speed...
So you're the one they talk about...
It doesn't work on you...
We must run.
Come quietly, Battosai!
So it was worth surviving...
Bring rope!
How's your arm?
Battosai!
-Get him! -That way.
This way!
I'm grateful...
but I wouldn't have cared either way.
You should tend to that arm.
"Kaoru Kamiya, Assistant Instructor."
It was always just a small school.
But a lot of people came here who were fond of my father.
But for the last six months, since this Battosai appeared...
no one comes.
I have to stop him, the sooner the better.
I wouldn't.
He's much better than you.
It's important in fencing to know your own limits.
You know what will happen the next time you meet.
The dignity of a school is not worth your life.
THE HEART TO LIVE IN AUTHENTIC TRUTH
The sword is not for killing.
Our school taught the sword that brings life to people.
To see that soiled by murder...
A wanderer...
wouldn't understand.
The sword that brings life...
Anyway, that arm should keep you here.
I'm sure your late father would not want his daughter
to give her life for his school.
Goodbye.
Look at this!
He's declared war on us.
KAMIYA FENCING DOJO
Wanderer?
Oh, it's you.
You're not happy to see Squire Yahiko Myojin?
Oh, be quiet.
Give me breakfast!
This hungry orphan needs a hot meal!
Stop it. First we train. -Get cleaning. -All right.
-Get cleaning. -All right.
THE HEART TO LIVE IN AUTHENTIC TRUTH
Who are you?
We want this dojo.
What?
You'll get a good price.
A certain gentleman will pay well.
It won't be a bad deal for you.
What?
-I'm not selling my father's dojo! -For just an Assistant Instructor...
you got a lot of nerve, honey.
Especially when your Battosai is a murderer.
He's not one of us!
Just let it go.
Nobody comes to this dojo now, anyway.
Get busy!
Don't!
Stop it!
Cut that out!
Yahiko! Stop it, will you!
Who is this kid?
I am Yahiko Myojin, defender of the weak!
Let him go!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Get tough first, then talk tough!
Yeah!
Your school teaches the sword that brings life, huh?
Let's see you take that sword and bring yourselves life.
Take your shoes off!
The sword brings life? You're dreaming!
No shoes!
Swords are for mayhem and killing.
That's what fencing is all about.
Now I'm mad.
-Wanderer. -Move!
Who are you?
I agree.
Her words are those of one whose hands are still clean.
She is dreaming.
The sword is a weapon meant for killing.
No fine words will change the truth of that.
But I vastly prefer...
Miss Kaoru's fond dreams to that truth.
Nonsense!
Fight him!
Go on!
Fight him! Get up there!
Fight him!
Battosai fought in the "High Heaven" style.
It is an old style, suited to one against many.
I wear this sword...
so that I do not kill.
It's you!
You?
Kaoru!
Careful!
-This man's dead! -He's dead.
What's going on here?
-Is that him? -No!
They attacked us.
But nobody's dead, they're just knocked out.
In here!
-Them! -Hey!
Swords are illegal, you know!
Take them!
-Move! -Get going!
What happened?
Hurry up, bastard!
It was my fault.
All of this happened because of me.
The dojo wasn't involved.
Come on!
Wait!
Wanderer.
Yes, ma'am?
At least tell me your name.
Wait!
-Kenshin Himura. -Move!
Kenshin.
"The Heart of the Sword"?
Open up!
New prisoner.
Move!
Open up!
Scars in a cross.
So it is you.
It's been a while...
Battosai.
I haven't seen you in ten years,
since Toba-Fushimi.
We need to talk.
Come out.
Battosai the Killer?
Where have you been hiding all these years?
Mr. Yamagata!
There were rumors of a man who could fight,
going around helping people.
I had them checked out.
Saito?
We've all gone different ways since ten years ago.
But all of us are still hoping for a better land.
Now he calls himself Goro Fujita. He helps me out.
What would you like?
This is being dealt openly.
Spiderweb.
It looks like regular opium, but it's completely different.
It's much more addictive.
Opium will destroy a country.
A land as powerful as China couldn't control it.
Now a part of the country is an English colony.
I am but a wanderer.
Why do you tell me this?
The people making this stuff probably have bigger plans.
We need your help.
Join with our army...
and put these arms of yours to good use.
I have no wish to serve as a killer.
A killer?
That was all to restore the Emperor's authority!
No guts anymore?
Is this a sword?
Without killing, who can you protect?
Even with this blade, I can protect the kind of people I meet now.
Let's see.
All fine words aside,
can you even protect yourself?
-Put up your sword. -No!
When a man's own blade faces him, he suffers.
Like this.
Remember how it felt?
I have abandoned my past.
I will kill no more.
Enough!
My apologies.
Not at all.
Let him go.
Hey, Kaoru!
Kaoru!
Sorry!
Are you okay?
Help me!
They're after me!
Please!
TOKYO POLICE PATROL 4TH UNIT
Miss Kaoru...
Where will you go?
Come with me.
You saved us.
You know, I was a killer.
No, I don't.
The man I met is a wanderer named Kenshin.
Everyone has things they don't want to talk about.
Right?
Here.
Take it.
Let's go.
Come on!
Let's go.
Come in.
Thank you.
Yahiko...
Yahiko Myojin. He trains here, sort of.
He moved in.
I'm just here because you need students.
He's rude, but he has potential.
I'm just here to get tough!
Yes, I know.
Kenshin's moving in, too.
That makes me "elder brother."
I'm honored.
Uh, right!
Hey!
Introduce me, too.
Who are you?
She was wet, so I heated the bath.
-Without asking? -And who's that gentleman?
Hey, wait...
Kenshin the Wanderer.
Oh, so you're him?
The boy told me.
Megumi Takani. Pleased to meet you.
The pleasure's mine.
Here's a change of clothes.
I thank you.
My father was a big man,
so these are from when he was young.
Maybe...
they're too gaudy?
No. They will be fine.
The sword brings life...
Come in!
So anyway, why are you here?
Oh, dear! She seems to think I'm in the way.
You're not from around here.
Where do you come from?
Not telling. Mystery becomes a girl.
It's ready.
-There. -I thank you.
Eat all you like. This is to thank you.
Then...
Very good.
You see?
That's hot!
-Be careful! -I know!
Kaoru.
I hear you had some trouble.
Tae...
Don't give in.
We've all decided we're not going to sell.
-Welcome! -Welcome!
Welcome!
That's Kanryuu Takeda. He's a rich businessman.
Washroom?
That way.
Sir!
Excuse me!
Are you the hero who saved the local dojo from ten men?
I am a merchant involved in trade.
Show him.
I'll be blunt.
With this we wish to hire you.
For the work of ten, ten times the pay.
How about it?
Will you be a bodyguard?
No, thank you.
This isn't enough?
"The hungry samurai picks his teeth, pretending he has eaten."
That's all very well.
But it's money that talks in this new age.
Pride won't bring you a penny these days.
It's the ones with that pride who fall furthest and hardest.
Look at all the brothels.
They're full of samurai wives and daughters.
Every gang of thieves these days are all former samurai.
It's time to forget you were ever a samurai...
and learn how to enjoy life.
That's rude.
Without money, you don't eat beef.
I'll take the money, then.
Sanosuke!
Hire me.
Why you?
I'm a street fighter.
I just got out of jail. I'm broke.
Are you tough enough...
to earn this?
Would the legendary killer care to try me...
Himura Battosai?
Hire me if I beat him.
The establishment will suffer.
Let's go outside.
Just what I wanted to hear!
Let's all go outside!
Fight! Fight!
This sword...
was made to cut down horses.
It's a 400-year-old relic.
It hasn't been maintained, so there's no edge on it.
But...
it'll still knock a man flat.
Hold it!
Himura Battosai...
Choshu Fief assassin from age 14 to 19, one of the Patriots of the Restoration.
But no one's seen him for the last ten years.
Move! Out of the way!
Move!
Put up your sword.
Draw yours
and fight!
I have no wish to.
Why not?
We have no quarrel.
Would a man like you...
serve a man like that?
Well?
What's wrong?
Well? What's wrong?
Come on, street fighter!
Flatten him!
Shut up! Don't tell me how to fight!
Forget it.
I'll just end up in jail again.
Sorry to bother you!
Go back inside, everybody!
Show's over!
My apologies.
Let's eat. We're wasting good beef.
He's the real thing.
Be careful.
We don't want Battosai angry at us.
Yes, sir!
Not enough blood.
It's still not enough blood.
This is my way.
I am the true Battosai the Killer.
Battosai again.
He kills hoodlums and cops. Whose side is he on?
Once you kill, there is no going back.
That is what killing means.
Go on ahead.
-Come on. -Hey!
I'm coming!
The men who attacked your dojo...
you could have killed them yourself.
If you had,
these officers wouldn't have died.
That back-blade of yours is very useful, isn't it?
Move!
Out of the way!
Will you be an assassin in the cause of the new age?
KYOTO, 14 YEARS EARLIER
Only if the lives I take...
bring a new age...
of peace.
Can you believe a guy getting married in these crazy times?
Sorry.
Oh, why not?
He's a happy guy.
I'm jealous.
Who's there? State your name!
You're Battosai?
You Choshu rebel!
Die!
I don't want to die.
I can't die now. I can't.
There's someone I care for.
I can't die now!
I can't die now! I can't die now!
There's someone I love...
I can't die.
I can't die...
I can't die.
I can't die now.
JUSTIFICATION FOR EXECUTION
How do I serve the new age...
DIVINE AUTHORITY
by killing those who are its future?
Am I doing the right thing?
You're nothing but a murderer.
Kenshin!
Miss Kaoru?
You hadn't come back. I was worried...
that maybe you'd gone away.
I'm hungry.
Magnificent.
I don't believe this thing.
And the plan?
Everything's ready.
We'll build a dock at that dojo and ship opium to where?
All over Japan.
No.
The world!
PURE NATION
With the money we take from the beasts it creates,
we buy guns.
The Kanryuu Empire!
I will rule this new age!
It begins.
Awaken, Battosai.
Megumi.
So here you are.
You're mixed up with opium, and that's a fact.
You're stuck with us,
or with opium, at least.
You're one of us, so I'll warn you.
Watch out.
Megumi's rice.
Kenshin's soup. And fish...
Kaoru fried the fish.
If you want to get married, you'd better learn how to cook.
You'll lose him.
Quiet!
You know what?
I need some new students.
This kid's making me rusty.
Look who's talking!
Calm down, both of you.
Let's eat.
Kaoru!
Is anyone here?
Kaoru!
Help us!
She went numb and started gasping.
We tried to find a doctor...
And?
Every doctor around here vanished two days ago.
We're at our wit's end.
Watch out.
That dojo will be mine.
Kaoru! Kaoru!
Help! Kaoru!
-Help! -What's wrong?
-You! -She collapsed.
Go inside!
In here?
What's going on?
Plague?
Somebody get a doctor!
Right here.
Fever, lethargy...
Rat poison?
Are you sure?
They need to vomit. Bring water.
But not from the wells. They might be poisoned.
Go buy some castor oil. Get towels and kettles.
-You! Buy all the water you can. -Yes.
Kaoru, is there a healer in the next village?
Yes.
I'll write a list.
We have to move fast!
-Yes, ma'am! -Yes.
Here's water!
He'll pay for this.
These are people's lives.
Miss Megumi,
isn't it time you told us who you were?
Her name's Takani?
Megumi?
You know her?
There's nobody in medicine who doesn't know the Takani family.
They're famous doctors.
They have been for generations.
But they were on the wrong side in the Boshin War.
It's said they were all killed.
But it looks like maybe a daughter survived.
You were an assassin, right?
Shouldn't you tell me about yourself before you make demands of me?
I'll bet...
those hands have killed many.
And those scars?
Battle scars?
Like a medal?
This scar...
came from a young samurai.
And this one...
came from the woman he was to marry.
I have killed...
-...more men than I can-- -I've never killed.
But I had no parents or family to depend on.
Kanryuu took me in.
I was his woman.
We used each other.
He used me to make opium and I used him...
to stay alive.
To stay alive.
Opium!
No! No!
Shut up! Keep quiet!
Kanryuu's got about 250 men.
Some are samurai, good fighters,
cut adrift by the new age.
I'll go with you.
Kenshin!
Kenshin, look!
Megumi's gone!
Oh, no.
I'll come, too.
Kaoru, you should stay here.
Your school cannot afford to lose you.
-But... -This'll take us all night.
Have breakfast for five, and the bathwater hot.
I'm coming!
Hold it!
You'll just be in the way.
-Shut up! -Yahiko.
Stay here.
Guard Miss Kaoru and the dojo.
I knew...
you'd be back.
This is the only place...
you have to come back to.
Tomorrow, -you get to work-- -I didn't come back...
-you get to work-- -I didn't come back...
to make opium.
What?
I'm here to kill you!
Don't worry.
We're stuck with each other.
I'll kill myself, too.
Don't just stand there!
Don't be stupid.
Thus, I atone!
You bitch!
After I treated you so nice!
He's here.
That man.
Kanryuu!
Hey!
I'll kick your ass, come out here!
Himura Battosai!
That's her. Megumi.
It's bad manners to come barging onto someone's property!
Oh, yeah?
Don't hold back!
Kill them!
Go on!
Kill!
Here's money!
Here's money! Kill them!
All the money you want!
Do it!
Kill them!
I don't get it. Why?
Why is Battosai doing this?
What does he stand to gain?
If he wanted gain, he'd be in the army by now.
The Patriots of the Restoration are all like that.
Tell me about it.
Hey!
Get that thing ready.
-You mean... -Just do it!
In business, you prepare for the worst!
Yes, sir.
Hey, take the woman away.
Do something for me.
Where's four-eyes?
Upstairs.
So who will fight me?
I will.
Bare fists. Time for a street fighter.
-Get going. -I thank you.
So you're Battosai?
Where's Miss Megumi?
Is that woman worth saving?
No one is not worth saving.
Fine words.
And why have you sold your soul to Kanryuu?
My soul?
I took you all for finer men than that.
Don't be stupid.
I was starving...
in this insipid new age of yours.
Hey! Hey!
Kenshin, are you okay?
Die.
What's with that sword?
It's my vow...
not to kill.
Not so fast!
Wait! Wait! Wait!
What for?
Want some?
Here.
Chicken?
The poor bird. I'm a vegetarian.
Wine?
Sure.
With all the men you've killed, you insult me with that blade?
To fight with fists,
you need to use your head!
It's been fun.
Now you're ready to fight, huh?
You're pledged not to kill?
Can you end this without killing?
Yes, I can.
Then try!
What a party.
Let's go.
Wait.
It's not over yet.
Fight.
Yes, it is.
I love this! Here.
-Light. -Sanosuke!
At least let me have a smoke.
You wrecked my house!
You wrecked it!
Where's the great Battosai? I'll show him!
I'll help you kill him.
How did you get here?
That kid came to the police.
Yahiko?
Well?
Look.
What's the matter?
He can only aim that monstrosity one way at a time.
Come one and all!
Make yourself at home! What's wrong?
I give up!
I give up. Whoa, don't shoot!
We can't fight that thing.
Right, Kenshin?
Come on out. We can't win.
I surrender.
Put your sword down.
Apologize to me. Down on your knees.
Take your clothes off! All of them!
Take off your clothes and kowtow to me!
Damn you!
Over here! Shoot! Shoot!
More! More!
Shit!
Do you know what money can't buy?
What you're begging for now.
Life.
No!
At last, I get to send you flying.
What?
I'll take it from here. Get going.
I thank you.
Miss Megumi!
I'm sorry I'm late.
You're fine now.
I'm glad you're safe.
He's got Kaoru!
So you're awake?
Don't look at me like that.
By taking you hostage, I enrage Battosai.
That anger will make him the killer he once was.
He should be here soon.
Kenshin.
You're angry.
At you, for involving her...
and at myself for letting you.
Kenshin?
That's right, Battosai.
Get mad!
Miss Kaoru!
Can you kill me with that?
Kenshin!
You didn't expect the back turn?
Kenshin!
Not yet, huh?
You're still a long way from the Battosai you once were.
Miss Kaoru!
My "One Side of the Soul" technique.
Strong enough to paralyze the lungs.
She's got two minutes.
Jine.
You don't have much time.
Let your sword speak for you.
Nicely done.
If you value your life,
lift the spell on her!
I can't break it.
There are only two ways.
She does it herself,
or you kill me...
and end my sword spirit.
Then...
To the death,
Himura Battosai.
The game is over.
I'm going to kill you.
The Battosai "Pure Draw Stance".
"High Heaven Style, Twin Dragon Strike".
Elbow shattered, tendons snapped.
You can never duel again.
And now...
I end your life.
For Miss Kaoru...
I will kill one more time.
Kill me.
Die!
Kenshin, no!
She broke it.
Miss Kaoru.
Don't go back to killing.
Killing is wrong.
You mustn't kill, Kenshin.
For the sake...
of those you've already killed.
And for...
all the people...
you've saved.
You don't have to kill...
to be of help to someone.
And...
that's...
the new age you fought for.
Miss Kaoru...
I'm going to finish this,
Battosai.
Enough.
With one arm, you have no chance.
This isn't over yet.
At heart, you're a killer.
I'm a killer too, so I know.
Once a killer, always a killer.
I'll watch from Hell as you rave
about being a wanderer.
You see?
Look what happens if you stop killing and take up that sham called justice.
Killing gives birth to hatred.
And hatred kills in its turn.
To break that chain...
I carry a sword that will not kill.
When will you ever learn?
So you're leaving?
Wandering is the easy way out.
Our only choice is...
to live and die by the sword.
-All these smuggled goods! -Hurry up.
Make sure you get everybody!
Help us!
Shut up!
-It hurts! -Get up!
Take me to the port.
Let me get away, and I'll reward you.
Yeah, right!
I've got lots of money. Right in this pocket here.
Can I go get my boot? It's hard to walk.
Hey, I'll be back!
I'll be back!
Kenshin!
You're up?
Kenshin! Where is he?
Oh, he's...
Oh, no!
Oh, hey...
Hey!
Kenshin.
You're awake, Miss Kaoru?
Don't jump to conclusions.
Kenshin's going to make dinner tonight.
I'm starving!
Meng Zi?
Meng Xiaojun.
He never imagined that in 20 years,
I'd make a career out of getting people to America.
Some see this place only as an English-language school.
They think it's the coolest place on Earth.
These are the TOEFL, GRE and ACT scores from New Dream students.
The Americans said such high scores are impossible.
You must be cheating.
Americans can be so naive sometimes.
For every 10,000 Chinese students studying in America,
three quarters came out of New Dream.
Our red flags are planted all across America.
Another flag… Wisconsin!
Wang Yang said in the past,
Chinese people spoke English with their mouth shut.
Why are you afraid to?
Because traditional education has destroyed your confidence.
You're embarrassed by your broken English.
But the one who's really having a hard time is
the audience of your bad English.
What have you got to lose?
Meng Xiaojun hates public speaking.
He prefers private consultations.
It's because you lack confidence.
He appears to talk about visas,
but he's actually teaching you about America.
Self-confidence is pivotal in American culture.
I just don't have it in me.
I'm afraid of rejection.
Mr. Meng,
I've had a crush on you for over a year now.
I'm married.
I know.
But at least I got to show you my "courage."
Meng's grandfather got his PhD in the US and returned to China in 1925.
He gave Meng his first English dictionary.
Meng's father also returned from the US with a PhD in 1955.
He gave Meng his second English dictionary.
Studying in the US was a family tradition.
It was his destiny…
and so was his romance with Liang Qin.
I suppose men's dreams usually begin with women.
Before I met my first girlfriend,
I carried buckets of hot water for a girl I liked.
Then I discovered she already had a boyfriend.
I asked her why she still allowed me to perform a service for her.
She said her boyfriend needed a break.
Even though she rejected me,
I wanted to see her every day.
Because she was my dream.
So what are dreams?
They are what makes you happy when you strive to achieve them.
Twenty years ago,
I was the one who usually gave the speeches.
According to your former employee, Niu Yongxiao,
you're one of the most unscrupulous men he's ever met.
Do you agree with him?
He should have said I'm the most.
Twenty years ago, Cheng didn't know how to tell a joke in public.
And Meng wasn't as serious-looking as he is now.
Only I haven't changed.
Meng said he once loved America.
He used the word "once."
While I,
a professed Godfather of Study Abroad,
have never been to America.
And today, we were being sued by America.
In 1979, Cheng was still a loser.
He failed the entrance exam twice.
I must take the exam again.
We can't afford it.
If you insist, we'll need a loan.
Get up now.
Uncle, get up.
Son.
Accept your fate and be a farmer.
Get up…
Mrs. Cheng, perhaps he deserves another chance?
Yes.
Our crops still grow without him.
Let him take the exam again.
All right, then.
This is your last chance.
-That's right. -Let's go.
-Finally, let's go. -Wait.
I need a loan.
A loan?
Americans will never understand how Chinese heroes can kneel
and even crawl for the right cause.
Shengqing, I love you!
Fifty-six.
Fifty-seven. Fifty-eight.
I met Wang Yang and Meng Xiaojun the first day I arrived at the university.
You're crazy!
Someone's trying to study here!
Go take a dump.
-Bastard! -Son of a bitch!
You've hit someone.
Don't leave!
Brother. Sorry.
It's all because that piece of shit.
Who?
-You. -What do you want?
Are you all right?
I'll beat you up.
Come on. Let him try.
From then on, I started to hang out with them in school.
Cheng, where do you most want to go?
-Tiananmen. -Tiananmen?
Cheng, listen.
Everyone in line for hot water here…
According to Meng, at the time, everyone wanted to go to…
America.
Okay. That's it for today.
Before we go, I have one last request.
Describe our generation in one word.
-Ambitious. -Idealistic.
-Impulsive. -Free.
-Skeptical. -Barbaric.
Lonely.
Starved for truth.
Cheng, what about you?
Forever Reds.
Ever wonder why we continue to
rehash various movements, ideologies and strategies?
Why?
It's because we want easy answers.
We want someone to tell us how to live our lives.
But the truth is, no one can tell us how to live.
Our lives belong to us.
We must find the answers for ourselves.
That is why
the most important concept for our generation is change.
Change the people, change everything around you.
But we must keep our newfound courage.
If we can do that, we can change the world.
Meng told me there was only one place where one could really change the world…
the USA.
Wang was always busy socializing.
He also accepted interviews,
even though it was prohibited by the school.
Wang later kept asking Lucy to come back to interview him.
Parasite.
Cheng, did you study Japanese before?
Your dictionary is outdated.
You should get the latest Oxford Dictionary.
Here.
"Louse" is "shizi" in Chinese.
The bug that crawls on you.
Do you think I can…
THE PROPERTY OF MENG NOT TO BE LOANED
It doesn't matter.
That day, I vowed to be like Meng one day.
I would read 800 books in four years.
I must conquer the YJU library!
I asked Wang for help.
He coaxed a female librarian to give him a spare key.
I thought I was the first person to sneak into the YJU library
not to steal books.
Stop following me.
Some girls reject you
before you even make a move.
Wang said love is like a VCR.
Sometimes it goes fast forward, sometimes it rewinds.
Sometimes there are pauses.
At this moment, Lucy hit "fast forward."
He puked?
Puked and cried the whole time.
Only one thing will make me cry…
When I make the cover of Time magazine.
Why not just say when you become the US president?
That I can't.
I had to be born in America to be the president.
America will never be rid of racism.
If a white man is alone in an elevator and sees three Black men entering,
he'll jump out of the elevator before the doors close.
In the eyes of white people,
Blacks will forever be a lazy, uneducated and uncivilized race.
As for Chinese Americans,
at least they're considered smart and hardworking.
But they're often accused of stealing the local jobs.
Professor…
have you been to the US?
Your views on the US are culled from books.
That's right, Professor. Truth comes from practical experience.
Which department do you two--
The so-called American Dream
means everyone has an equal opportunity.
The US is the only place on Earth where that's possible.
You're still too young, too naive.
Professor, I will go to America.
Sit down! Class is not over.
-Who are you? -He's my teacher.
So what?
We must treat our teachers with respect.
You can't behave this way.
-Beat them up! -Run!
If I wasn't worthy of being their friend before,
I am now!
Meng said courting Su Mei would be an uphill battle.
Wang promised to help push me uphill.
She's here!
I'll hide the ladder.
Hurry up.
Hold on tight.
The ladder…
What was she looking at?
The ladder…
Robert Frost said
a mother takes 20 years to make a man out of a boy.
It takes another woman 20 minutes to make a fool out of him.
He's making a move!
If you say no,
I'll pull you into the lake with me.
She'd rather die.
Go after her!
I can't swim!
Jump!
Su Mei ended up catching pneumonia.
Wang said we could only win this uphill battle
by waging a war of attrition.
Wearing down the enemy until she gives up.
Get lost.
You heard me. Get lost!
Just leave.
I'm contagious.
Cheng Dongqing…
why you?
Why did it have to be you?
Why not me?
I got used to the sound of her coughing.
In the end, I contracted tuberculosis
and had to take a year off school.
One day during my stay in the hospital,
Wang came to visit and invited Meng along.
I'm off.
I really can't.
I'm taking the TOEFL test soon.
I can't risk an infection.
This test is too important.
Give him this.
I read 800 books like I said I would.
People no longer mistook my spoken English for Japanese.
But in the end, America still rejected me.
On what grounds was I rejected?
I have all my papers here.
I've come here dozens of times.
Listen to me.
Let me explain.
America needs me.
Lucy said that she didn't want to leave China.
Wang gave up his visa for her.
Let's go.
Why?
Why did you reject me?
Let's go. America doesn't need you yet.
Meng.
Thanks for your note in the dictionary.
I hope to make you jealous one day.
Meng said he was born to see that day.
His grandfather and father traveled to America by ship
and returned by ship.
As for Meng, he broke his family tradition.
I'm not coming back.
Meng.
Think you're a big shot?
Don't bother coming back.
Fuck off and never come back!
Meng, I've been quite busy lately.
The students enjoy my class.
Their other classes are too demanding.
They get to nap in my class.
Also…
I was denied a visa two more times.
Class dismissed.
Mr. Cheng, a package from the US.
Meng.
You didn't send me Time magazine because you didn't make the cover yet,
right?
This magazine will suit Wang more.
But I need to censor it first without prejudice.
Water, please?
Sure.
The latest TOEFL exercise books are so expensive.
Just be patient. I'll get paid soon.
Forget it.
Careful, it's hot.
Meng, you would never guess…
…that someone as gutless as me…
What about "crow"?
…would dare moonlight for extra cash.
Cheng, you even started moonlighting!
As for me,
I'm now a teaching assistant at Columbia at the lab run by Professor Oliver.
Meng Xiaojun!
Zhang Xi?
How are you?
Long time no see.
How are you?
I got my master's degree in biology.
Where do you work now?
I graduated a while ago but can't find a job.
Why did the rooster crow before daybreak?
Why?
How's Liang Qin? Did you two get married?
She gives piano lessons in Long Island.
What brings you here?
I had a job interview.
I have to go to work.
That's great.
-Call me. -I won't keep you.
Let's have dinner sometime.
Director Gao.
I've been teaching Dongdong English for some time.
Mr. Cheng, I'm grateful.
It's my job.
Director Gao, I wanted to ask you…
about my salary. We've never discussed it.
Mr. Cheng, do you know why I chose you?
Because you're an honest man.
Education isn't about profit.
Money corrupts everything.
These are for you. Don't be shy.
I got paid in dumplings.
Where did you get the money?
From private tutoring.
Have more. I ate quite a lot earlier.
Now I'm the visa officer.
No need to practice.
I got my visa.
Cheng, I told the visa officer
Lucy broke up with Wang.
She said her VCR only goes in fast-forward now.
She wanted to return to the US.
She already had enough baggage.
Adding Wang would be too heavy.
No one will publish my poems.
You're all just trash now.
I'm an idiot!
When we two parted
In silence and tears
Half broken-hearted
To sever for years
Wang said the '80s died for him today.
Of course they're cheap.
Then get me a few trainloads.
Got any US dollars?
Foreign exchange certificates are fine, too.
Come on, let's do business.
DAHONG FASHION JINSHA COSMETICS
What's wrong with you?
Still reading Carnegie?
He's a liar.
Why did you move here?
The Americans opened a store up the street.
Do you have enough soap, toothpaste and towels?
Tell me if you run out.
Lao Zei started a business in Hainan.
He sent you coconut-flavored instant coffee.
It tastes horrible so I'm not sending it to you.
Cheng came here to call Su Mei long distance each week.
Apart from going to school and earning her scholarship, Su Mei said
her life was washing dishes at a restaurant.
Make it quick. We're closing up.
Su Mei ended every call by saying…
That's it. I'm exhausted.
Cheng, Professor Oliver treats me well.
The students are very friendly.
They set the bar high for teaching assistants.
The job is very demanding,
but compared to washing dishes, this place is paradise.
Cheng, Liang Qin and I rented an apartment close to the college,
just two blocks away.
It's a little noisy, but bright.
I'm giving so many piano lessons,
my fingers will fall off soon.
At least you have the job at the lab.
Soon we can afford to move out of this dump.
We're lucky to still work in our field.
This isn't what you wrote in your letters.
The school found out about my private tutoring business.
They might fire me.
You'll live on in the hearts of your students.
To send me to school,
my mother borrowed from everyone.
She can't pay my debts, too.
If I were you,
before they fired me, I'd quit.
Quit?
I'd starve to death.
I quit. I'm still alive.
You'd be dead if it wasn't for me.
The world has changed.
Even egg vendors make more than you these days.
You won't starve to death.
Watch the movie!
"I organized unauthorized classes, violating YJU rules.
I accept any disciplinary actions you deem fit.
But I beg my board directors for leniency
and a chance to redeem myself.
The accused, Cheng Dongqing."
Cheng…
let's break up.
That day, Beijing lost their bid to host the Olympics.
"Both of them stayed behind."
"Stayed behind."
Would you mind not sleeping in class?
You've come to the best university.
Your parents didn't spend their life savings
so that you could sleep here!
If you hate my class, just leave!
Why do you want to learn English?
I want to go to America, sir.
Do you like English?
No.
Me neither.
I never liked it.
You know my vocabulary is quite good.
It's because of you guys.
One day, a student came up to me and asked me,
"How do you pronounce this?"
It looked familiar but I didn't have a clue.
I was so ashamed.
I began memorizing dictionaries
one by one as they came out.
No one would be able to challenge me again.
When I was in school,
I was afraid of being rejected by my peers
because I was a village boy.
I was always trying to please them.
My best friends Meng and Wang compared me
to a baby born out of wedlock.
A bastard.
I said my parents were married when I was born.
But I told them my mom's a bitch, though.
I went on to date the prettiest girl in school.
After I graduated,
I took the TOEFL test and applied for a visa.
In the end, she got her visa and I didn't.
I became
"The man who was left behind."
She took my virginity the night she left for America.
Mr. Cheng, your class seems different today.
Students…
Mr. Cheng Dongqing, an instructor in the Foreign Languages faculty,
organized unauthorized classes outside the university.
His actions corrupt and undermine the education system.
After careful deliberation,
the board of directors has decided to dismiss Mr. Cheng.
Mr. Cheng Dongqing, an instructor in the Foreign Languages faculty,
organized unauthorized classes outside the university.
His actions corrupt and undermine the education system.
Cheng became the first YJU instructor ever to be fired publicly.
He set a new precedent,
something even Meng never accomplished.
He was immediately evicted from the staff dormitories.
Mr. Cheng, where do you hold your classes?
I'm taking the TOEFL test next month.
I'm afraid that I won't pass. I want you to tutor me.
No one knows him better than me.
He had no choice.
His other option was to return home in disgrace
and teach English to his crops.
CHENG'S TOEFL PREPARATION COURSE
You should have known Su Mei would never leave America.
That's why she broke up with you.
Are you all right?
I feel like my youth is over
and it's buried right here.
You make me sick.
When a person fails in love and life, he's bound to behave strangely.
Cheng couldn't stand the sight of an empty wall.
Whenever he saw one, he plastered it with posters.
Nearly every wall in the neighborhood felt his wrath.
The bastard climbed every lamppost in YJU.
I taught him the trick to get girls.
Now he used it to promote his classes.
Usually, this word…
Cheng chose this place for one reason only.
Buy a piece of chicken and you could sit here all day.
Jin-qu, Ge-xin.
Jin-qu.
Keep it down.
Progressive.
Go buy another piece of chicken.
Today's word is
"jiu-hu-che."
Remember it this way.
"I cannot die."
Huai-yun.
"I want a boy."
"Get a boy."
-Pregnant. -"Get a boy."
Experience shows us,
decisions made under desperation usually turn out to be the right ones.
I can't teach in this place forever.
I want to find someplace bigger and take in more students.
Let's join forces. You're more qualified than me.
You speak perfect English.
Let's do it together.
Here.
All successful men have the ability to adapt to the changing times.
Who said that?
Carnegie.
Didn't you say he was a liar?
But we were the biggest liars.
We thought we could change the world but we couldn't even change ourselves.
As long as we have food.
We have this place all to ourselves.
This used to be a state-owned factory.
Since they kept closing shops in the early '90s,
Cheng took advantage like a thief.
After exploiting the Americans,
he was ready to exploit his own country.
Students,
learning English is like learning bird calls.
If you make a bird call in the forest
and four birds land on your shoulder,
it means your English has reached level four.
If six birds land on your shoulder,
it means your English has reached level six.
If you attract a flock of birds, it means…
You've passed the TOEFL!
It means you've become a birdman.
Just now, a female student came to me.
She said, "I've fallen in love with a boy.
But he has nothing to offer other than his good looks.
What should I do?"
I told her, if she pursues a boy just for his looks,
we call that "hao-se."
But if a boy pursues a girl just for her looks,
we call that "shen-mei."
I kept my aesthetic pursuits within the legal limit.
I ended up dating the prettiest girl in law school.
The bastard used his past love affair to keep his students engaged.
But he must have been suffering inside.
I used Hollywood films to keep them interested.
Don't you get it?
Kind of…
Has no one here seen this film,
On the Waterfront, starring Marlon Brando?
No.
What's the last film you saw?
Ghost.
"As previously stated,"
or, "Me too."
Using the word "ditto" seems less trite,
but it conveys the deep connection between the characters.
Wang and I taught 12 classes each day
from morning till midnight.
Really tired.
Wang said, "Our memories are not as good when we are tired.
We won't remember to question the purpose of what we are doing.
As a result, we are happier."
We're rich!
We're rich!
Brother.
What if your life is filled with lies?
You're drunk.
Then tell the lies to get another life.
Giving up on your dreams is easy
I'm not afraid of the day When it's just you and me
One day I'm afraid I'll fail
Giving up on your dreams is easy
I'm not afraid that one day When it's just you and me
Meng, we didn't change the world.
The world changed us.
I lied to you.
But you lied to me, too.
You vowed to do something great in America.
Meng…
why did we come here?
My village has an old custom.
After a long journey,
you must cut your hair before entering the house.
It's Wang.
Bring some girls over tonight.
A friend came back from America.
No! He's not married.
Reserve your biggest room for us.
It's Wang, Mr. Wang.
See you tonight.
The teachers are here.
Mr. Cheng, Mr. Wang.
-Yours. -Yeah.
Hello.
Yes.
We're on the outskirts of the city,
so we give the students a place to stay.
Meng, I believe our venture has potential.
Of course it can't compare to your life in the US.
Comrade, let our leader speak.
How many students do you have?
Not many. Around 2,000.
US VISA SEMINAR
Students, our speaker today is
Mr. Meng Xiaojun.
He just completed his studies in America.
Mr. Meng has been my idol since we met.
Each time I try to catch up, he outpaces me again.
Please give Mr. Meng a warm welcome.
Being confident, honest, sensible and organized
are the four keys to getting a US visa.
Go on. Why did you stop?
Without confidence, you'll appear weak…
very weak.
They…
They think the weak are…
Students…
Mr. Meng just arrived yesterday.
He's still jet-lagged.
There's another seminar tomorrow.
Cancel it.
Why?
He just needs some sleep.
I don't think that's it.
He'd rather work himself to death.
Maybe it's stage fright.
Impossible.
He never had this problem before.
You haven't seen him in years.
I've thought it through.
No one knows America better than I do.
From now on, I won't conduct large-scale seminars.
I'll do one-on-one mock interviews.
Anyone wants to go to America will have to come through New Dream.
As for his stage fright,
Meng never mentioned it and we never asked.
We acted as if nothing happened.
I don't understand.
What's your girlfriend got to do with your visa rejection?
She ruined me!
She broke up with me a month after she left for the US.
Good.
At least she didn't lie
and wait a year to tell you.
Let's return to your visa application.
You were rejected because they thought you wanted to immigrate.
I wouldn't immigrate, even if they asked me to.
No matter what I said, they refused to listen.
If you didn't plan to immigrate,
why did you state in your application
that your purpose in the US was to increase your income?
I told the truth.
Everyone knows you make more money in the US.
Student visa applicants with any motive other than receiving an education
are automatically rejected.
You don't even know?
You were rejected because you don't understand the US.
You blame your girlfriend because you don't know women.
Overall, you know nothing about yourself.
Now go fix your application.
Mr. Meng…
Next.
Listen, visa officers want to see confident, enthusiastic students.
You can't even speak clearly.
The next day, hordes of students lined up for mock interviews with Meng.
You think lying to Americans is easy?
Just say something.
If you keep crying, I can't help you.
You need to show that a Green Card is like toilet paper.
Too rough to wipe your ass.
Today,
Wang came for a mock interview with Meng.
Using film to teach English
is slow and ineffective.
Do you know why you speak English better than I do?
It's because you had an American girlfriend.
Are you still in touch with Lucy?
None of your business.
You think you understand me?
You're probably aware the essence of spoken language
isn't in its expressions
but in its thinking.
You can speak like an American because you know how Americans think.
That's what you should teach your students.
The others can't teach that.
A student came to me and said, "My pronunciation is perfect,
grammar is accurate and vocabulary is huge.
I can comprehend the China Daily better than Chinese-language papers.
Do you think I have a good command of English?"
So I gave him a copy of the Wall Street Journal.
It covered the same story as the China Daily.
He couldn't understand a word.
He was shocked and asked me, "Why?"
I told him China Daily may be written in English,
but the Wall Street Journal embodies the American way of thinking.
If you want to master English, you must first learn to
Well said.
What about something specific?
For example, if an American visits you at home
when you answer the door, what's the first thing you say?
Americans don't greet friends that way.
They're more direct, less formal.
They would simply say, "Come on in."
Can you…
be even more specific?
If you were in a relationship with an American girl for four years
and suddenly one day, she said,
how would you respond?
Don't say anything.
Just turn around and leave.
Otherwise, she'll treat you like excess baggage.
The last person to have a mock interview with Meng was me.
Do you have dreams?
Do you always embarrass your clients?
I offer visa consultations.
Wang teaches the American way of thinking.
But they're just gimmicks.
What gives New Dream its competitive edge?
You.
You think that's funny?
I'm being sincere.
Let me put it this way.
I don't know if you have dreams.
But get this.
A loser-turned-headmaster talking about dreams…
who can top this?
Cheng…
you're our ultimate weapon against the competition.
I've drafted a speech for you.
The theme is "What are Dreams?"
It's your show now.
Students, I've never had dreams.
I don't even know what dreams are.
But I understand failure.
I'm not a a good speaker.
But I'm an expert on failure.
Chinese students have the highest failure rate in the world,
because we have the harshest exam system in the world.
According to the statistics in 1993,
only 44.1% middle school students went on to high school.
In other words, nearly six million failed.
Matriculations rates are 39.9%.
Another 1.4 million failed.
Among all the New Dream students preparing for TOEFL and GRE exams,
only one in four will earn scholarships to the US.
Another 30,000 failed.
Failure is undeniable.
Life is full of despair.
It's a fact of life!
So what do we do?
Being in deep water alone won't drown you.
Not making a move will.
So you have to keep swimming.
Those who choose to give up from the outset to avoid failure
have already failed.
Failure is nothing to be afraid of.
The only thing to fear is fear of failure.
We should seek victory in failure.
Find hope…
in despair.
Who's in charge here?
I am.
You converted an abandoned factory into a school without authorization.
It's a serious violation of building codes.
Besides,
we could shut you down for not having a license to operate.
You can't be serious.
We applied for a license long ago
but the approval was delayed.
To qualify for a school license,
the applicant must be an associate professor at minimum.
You also need approval from the university.
You failed to meet both conditions.
We've already talked to the various departments.
They've all agreed to help us.
Sorry, we're just enforcing the law.
We can't help you.
You can't just shut us down on a whim.
The government now encourages opening private schools.
We're protected under the law.
Who said you could speak?
Why can't I speak?
We applied for a license. The approval is just delayed.
We're protected under the law.
If you abuse your authority, I'll sue you!
Go ahead, sue me. I'll be right here.
No. Sorry.
He's had too much to drink.
My friend just returned from America.
He's suffering from jet lag.
So he's been to America?
The smart ones don't return.
What did you say?
No. Sit, please.
How much is the fine?
We'll pay.
Meng, this is China, not the US.
The American approach won't work here.
I never imagined you'd be more impulsive than me.
Get in.
I'm not leaving.
Cheng…
I'm staying.
I'll work for you from now on.
If New Dream was a VCR…
How does our headmaster memorize words?
…the remote control was in Meng's hand.
"I must win."
He only used one button on his remote…
"Fast forward."
"Crush it."
Good marketing is not about fancy gimmicks.
It's about sharing.
Within a year, he launched over 25 initiatives.
Thirty to be exact.
Here are the proposed course offerings for the Internet.
One of them was…
"So fat that you could die."
Meng said teachers traditionally rule the classroom.
It's the reverse at New Dream.
Our students get to rate their teachers
and decide which teachers stay.
You can try teaching.
If you can't even teach, you have one option left.
Even an idiot can do it.
Be a headmaster.
Isn't that going a bit overboard?
He can still go further.
Wang and I believed that because Meng returned from the US,
he could see things that we missed.
The Internet?
It sounds like something far in the future.
If it's easy for us, then it's easy for others, too.
That's why I gave a one-word response to his plans.
Yes.
Headmaster Cheng, your campus is the coolest
and the biggest private school in China.
What's your formula for success?
If there is one, I don't know.
From my experience,
when you realize that failure is only a bump in the road,
you're already on the path to success.
Mr. Cheng, over here, please.
Camera ready.
Wait.
A few more pictures.
Good.
Godfather of Study Abroad, Cheng Dongqing.
You made the front page?
How do I look?
Sir, this is a proposal for shareholding reform.
Cheng, yes or no?
This time I must say no.
I know this is a big decision.
Take your time, okay?
I think I heard no.
Zhang may be the teacher with the lowest score,
but he wasn't born with a sense of humor,
just like me.
We accept that he refuses to be coached.
But he publicly denounced our teaching methods.
Zhang has been with us from the start,
since our days at the abandoned factory.
Let's just put him in administration.
In other words,
instead of firing him, he's being promoted.
If you can't even fire one employee,
how do you expect to head a corporation?
I'll slowly adapt.
Li Ping…
Any left?
Yes.
Back to the shareholding reform issue, what have you decided?
Meng, can't we just wait a bit longer?
I'm fed up.
Why are you stalling? Just say yes or no.
Is it because you don't want to give up control?
It never entered my mind.
You deserve the lion's share of the credit. You've earned it.
I get 51%,
and you and Wang together get the other 49%.
You get 25%. He gets 24%.
You made this?
It's good!
Let's set a time to sign the purchase agreement.
Cheng Dongqing…
Stop it.
Isn't it enough that I talk about it every day?
How about wet dreams?
When you really listen to someone…
you don't listen to what he says
but what he didn't say.
So what didn't you say?
Oh, no.
You had an affair
and knocked up a student?
Meng.
You must stop this.
Liang Qin and I are good friends.
You're unfaithful.
Shut up.
We used questions from old GRE and TOEFL exams in our tutorials
without acquiring the rights from the US Educational Exam Services.
This could lead to future litigation.
Cheng, we've failed.
-IPO? -Yes, IPO.
Don't stress yourself out.
No one blames you for failing with EES.
On the second day of my return,
I told you we're not creating just any school.
I just didn't reveal my plan then.
Tell me, why do we need to go public?
To be number one.
Aren't we already number one?
Not outside China.
That's why we need to launch our IPO as soon as possible.
This time I must say…
Someone gave me a bottle of '82 Lafite.
We're not strapped for cash. Why go public?
I'm a teacher. I just want to teach.
New Dream is ours.
Private companies have the lowest overhead.
Once we go public, the shareholders own us.
It's like entering a cage.
Who doesn't live in a cage?
His thinking has trapped him in an even smaller cage.
New Dream needs to go international. It needs to go public.
He's not against the idea. Now just isn't the time.
Our competitors are racing to be
the first publicly traded education corporation in China.
Can we afford to wait?
No one remembers the second man to walk on the moon.
Why are we going to the moon?
He's being rash.
Education and financial capital are antithetical.
Slow and steady versus speed.
We three aren't the only passengers on board.
We have 50,000 students.
I have to ensure our ship doesn't sink.
He won't take risks because he's afraid to fail
and return to being a loser
-for one simple reason. -What?
Because he doesn't think he deserves his success.
He really said that?
Yes.
He said that he was proud of your success.
Have you considered what Meng wants?
What's the meaning of this? What is this?
You find this funny?
Cheng Dongqing, enjoy your Christmas.
This was his gift to me.
A 300 square-meter property with land rights for 70 years.
He had no idea what it was that I truly wanted.
He didn't know what Meng truly wanted.
He could only put a stop to what he didn't want.
Today is our first major shareholders meeting.
Please take a look at the business proposal.
What's this?
There's a limit to what the three of us can do.
We need the support and strength of everyone assembled.
New Dream is now co-owned by all the shareholders here.
Why has my share been reduced?
Mine was reduced, too.
I increased the number of shares issued by 30%.
Some were distributed to the senior employees.
The rest goes into an options pool.
Everyone's share has been diluted.
But you and Wang are still the biggest shareholders after me.
You knew about this?
I found out just now.
But I agree.
So I'm the last to know.
Why?
I arrived at this decision after careful consideration.
You did this to stop us from going public.
Am I right?
You're rushing things.
I want to slow down.
Otherwise, we'll miss the bigger picture.
It's all over for me now.
You are using bribes to build a majority coalition.
That means from now on anything I propose can be vetoed.
You're taking over, correct?
Yes.
This is the system now.
So this is what they call "getting at the root."
Your tactics won't work.
Cheng, we're in a different day and age.
I think you've misunderstood.
This meeting is over!
Didn't you say you have a swimming lesson? Go!
That's right, he can swim now.
Congratulations!
I'm surprised at what you've become.
Can't we discuss this in private?
The three of us aren't the only passengers on board here.
But this ship won't stop once it sets sail.
It only moves forward!
No one can stop New Dream from going public.
I have the biggest stake in New Dream.
Final decisions are made…
by me.
Because I'm the leader of New Dream.
Leader?
I put New Dream in the right direction!
Wang provided all technical support! And you?
You only put money under the bed.
Cheng Dongqing, Chinese traitor!
New Dream is for traitors!
Cheng, you sell out China!
Who are you calling a traitor?
Call the police.
Why am I branded a traitor?
When Americans bombed our embassy, you attacked an English school.
If aliens attacked the Earth,
would you destroy the aerospace headquarters?
He always stepped up when it counted.
Something I couldn't do.
You're no different from people 30 years ago.
They only knew how to bully their own
and beat their fellow countrymen.
Cowards!
Savages!
You should learn from your oppressors until you're stronger than them.
They now call him the Godfather of Study Abroad.
Everyone thought I would leave.
The total number of New Dream students
-exceeds 3,888,888! -Exceeds 3,888,888!
Actually, that's not what it was.
After YJU fired me, I began organizing classes.
Every day, I plastered lampposts with ads.
Whenever I see a lamppost now, I still get the urge.
That's life.
We're businessmen.
Kowtowing is a way of life.
We're prostitutes behaving like widows.
What is he up to these days?
He reads books on business management
and studies IPO proposals from other companies.
Yes, I've read it.
I compiled a viability report
with assessments from all sides.
Now is not the time to go public.
We should wait for the right opportunity.
What opportunity?
-I'm still waiting. -Like a fengshui master?
We've waited four years.
Four years.
Even a new company would be public by now.
We are an education corporation.
We can't just blindly go public.
The US stock market is a mess.
The Chinese companies listed on US exchanges
are all suspended or trading below par.
Most are now penny stocks.
Penny stocks are still stocks.
They generate more than just leaving money in the bank.
Ask the shareholders here if they want to go public.
I recommend delaying New Dream's IPO plan indefinitely.
Those in favor, raise your hands.
Cheng Dongqing, the people have spoken.
Then I must exercise my power of veto.
I'm the largest shareholder.
I hold the deciding vote.
I vote against going public.
You're such a coward.
Mr. Cheng, as an investment consultant, I must remind you
RMB appreciation is expected to impact many domestic industries
but benefit overseas education.
And you are…
Xu Wen, a former student of mine.
I am now New Dream's IPO consultant.
You're fired.
I took your advice. I learned how to fire people.
Cheng Dongqing, you're a piece of shit!
Mr. Meng!
You bastard!
What is this!
Are we just pawns in your game!
What makes you think you're better than us?
Are you done fighting?
I have an announcement.
I'm getting married.
But… to who?
I'd like to thank everyone here for attending my wedding.
Getting married is the best thing that I've ever done.
I'm grateful to my wife, Li Ping, for agreeing to marry me.
She made me realize that true love comes when you least expect it.
I will always…
One more kiss!
I have three pieces of advice for all the men here.
Never play mahjong with your mother-in-law.
Never sleep with women more ambitious than you are.
Right.
And never start a business with your best friends.
Let's eat and drink and enjoy yourselves.
It's time to toast…
Drink up.
Cheers.
Bottoms up.
I used to only know one way of life,
which is the opposite of other people.
Now I know
the life most people choose is worth it.
That's why I married Li Ping.
I'm very happy today. Very, very happy.
I want out.
What?
What did you say?
I'm done.
Meng, New Dream can't survive without you.
I've decided.
We've been friends for over 20 years.
Friends?
Shouldn't we talk?
When you defended Wang and me from the mob at YJU,
I believed we were friends.
When you two sent me off to America, I believed it.
But not anymore.
All right, let's come clean.
Remember that dictionary?
The note inside wasn't meant for you.
I wrote it to myself.
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.
I knew that in your eyes
I was always just a hick.
Meng, you've gone too far this time.
If it weren't for Cheng, we wouldn't be friends.
You think the world revolves around you.
Do you remember…
back when he contracted TB?
You didn't visit him once because of the TOEFL exam.
You selfish bastard.
So that's when it all started.
You thought I despised you.
So you've been waiting for the chance to thwart me and teach me a lesson.
Am I right?
What's the point, Cheng?
Right. I had a point.
I've made my point.
Leave if you want.
I'll buy you out at a million yuan per share.
Are you crazy?
What!
Ever since you convinced him to stay, he's been working his ass off.
Is this how you treat your friend?
Didn't I do the same?
Do you think I did this all for myself?
I may be selfish, but at least I have the guts to admit it!
Stop acting like sissies.
Just fight and get it over with!
Go on! Hit him!
Fight!
You suggested splitting up first.
You haven't been the same since you returned from the US. Why?
At least I put up a fight!
As for you? One American girl was enough to crush you!
Meng.
Damn you!
Get off!
Stop it!
Get off! Stop.
Now what?
Yes.
I'm crazy.
You… Godfather of Study Abroad.
Elite from America.
You two are the best.
What's become of the three of us?
What have we become?
I'm no elite.
Do you know what I did in America?
How should I know?
I wasn't even a waiter, I was a busboy.
Busboys don't get tips. You know?
I had no future there so I returned!
I had no friends…
except for the two of you!
I always told you everything, even if it offended you.
But you?
I had stage fright. I was afraid to say it.
You never asked me about it!
Is that what friends do? Is it?
And Wang, you're wrong.
I only used to think the world revolves around me…
a long time ago.
I'm going to Shenyang tomorrow.
Someone wants to start a school there.
Year after year, I worked day and night.
I did it for the two of you.
I'm fed up.
I quit.
I imagined our reunion a million times.
I imagined her telling me…
I'm proud of your accomplishments.
Cheng Dongqing…
did we change the world…
or did the world change us?
NEW DREAM ACCUSED OF STEALING EES MATERIALS
Mr. Cheng's here!
Mr. Cheng.
Is the success of New Dream founded on piracy?
Is it true that classes have to be suspended because of the lawsuit?
Have the US filed a motion to shut down New Dream?
CHENG DONGQING IS A THIEF EES SUES CHINA NEW DREAM
CONNECTING…
Are you ready for America?
At least give me the directions.
Let's get some Chinese food.
I'm dying for a bowl of rice.
Come on.
Where are we going?
Let's eat at a very American diner.
This is where I used to work.
That woman…
Well done.
…gave me small change from her tips sometimes.
She gave me the least out of everyone.
The first time I came to America,
I fed rats in a lab
and bussed tables here.
When I came here the second time
I held my head high.
We had a successful career.
I just wanted to show them that I wasn't a loser.
But they didn't…
They didn't even extend the most basic courtesy.
They had gone through my things for an hour.
Americans still think we all want to stay behind.
Six hours and eight cups of coffee later…
It was then I realized
we are really too young, too naive.
I realized that…
only when we were listed on the New York Stock Exchange
would they finally
recognize us
and show us respect.
Cheng, you were right all along.
New Dream didn't need to go public.
I wanted it for selfish reasons.
I'm sorry.
Meng, when we finish eating,
we'll take America.
Meng,
this lab has been named in your honor.
I made a donation in your name.
I wasn't happy with my last gift to you.
What do you think of this one?
"Tu bie."
I like this very much anyway.
The next day, we went to Vegas.
Cheng had a massive nosebleed after losing big.
I often reminisce
about those golden days.
Su Mei invited us to dinner at her home.
She told me success wasn't important.
What mattered was keeping your dignity,
even if you lead an ordinary life.
That night, I dreamed about Meng.
He was walking down the streets of New York in 1980.
He looked so bright and confident,
like the sunshine on the streets.
I later told him, "Wrinkles may crease your forehead.
All you can do
is never allow them to crease your heart."
YANJING UNIVERSITY
Cheng uses public speaking as a substitute for sex.
He said things no one would dare say in public.
He makes me sick.
He dims the lights not to be romantic but to save money.
He never really wanted to change the world.
