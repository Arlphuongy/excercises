[woman on comms] What are you doing, Captain?
I think it's pretty obvious. I'm stealing this jet.
[woman] I think it's pretty obvious you're trying to. -You know I can track your jump. -Yeah, but you know that I know that.
-You know I can track your jump. -Yeah, but you know that I know that. So one of us doesn't know something else, right?
[man 2] Ma'am, he's initiated wormhole sequencing.
[woman] Adam, I want you to listen very carefully.
If you don't abort right now, I will shoot you out of the--
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure is gonna be a scary threat,
but if I'm right, your tracking system is about to…
-…crash. -♪ We made it, baby ♪
-♪ Gimme some lovin' ♪ -♪ Gimme some lovin' ♪
-Okay, let's not die! -[alarm beeping]
[boy] Adam!
I'm gonna kill you!
Reed!
Oh no. I'm so sorry.
That's my bad. Hi.
-No. -Okay. Bye!
[boy] Reed! Get your ass back here.
-Got anything else you wanna say? -Actually, I--
-[groans] -Huh? No more jokes?
-Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this. -[Adam] Who talks like that?
Did you order, like, a "Bully Starter Kit" on Amazon or somethin'?
I mean, do you even hear yourself? Chuck, we talked about this.
-I didn't say anything. -Shut up, Chuck.
[man on PA] There will be an assembly in the gymnasium now. Please proceed to the gymnasium.
Not a word.
-[sighs] -[man] Mrs. Reed-- [Mrs. Reed] See his face?
And, what, you're gonna suspend Adam? Because what? You think he started a fight with that thug Ray?
Was it Ray Dollarhyde again?
It's barely been a year since we lost his father. You could show some compassion.
[Adam] It wasn't my fault.
I know you, Adam. I know that mouth of yours. I know exactly what got you punched.
He was giving me crap in front of the whole class. -I couldn't just take it. -He's twice your size.
-I couldn't just take it. -He's twice your size.
Everyone is twice my size. I've seen babies bigger than me.
-I don't understand you. -Dad would.
What's going on, honey? Can you just tell me?
If I keep having to leave work in the middle of the day, I'm gonna lose my job.
It's the third time you've been suspended for fighting. You'd think I'd be better at it by now.
This goes on your permanent record. Get that? Care about your future?
Do you? Son, you'd better start caring, because the future is coming, sooner than you think.
[Mrs. Reed] Hey, Adam.
Adam, I'm headed out.
Come and have your dinner.
Where you goin'?
Oh, just out to dinner with a friend.
Which friend?
-His name's Derek. We work together. -You're goin' on a date.
-Not a date. I don't think it's a date. -Your dress thinks it is.
Oh, it is a date. I am going on a date. Why am I going on a date?
Can we please stop saying "date" now? Thanks.
Adam, I'm sorry. We… we should have spoken about this.
I don't know how to handle it. Let's talk about it now.
-Dear God, no. -No! You can have any kind of feeling.
-It's normal. As long as we're a team-- -[phone alert]
Oh! Time to go.
[Mrs. Reed] He texted me?
Well, look at that.
It's a whole new world. -But we will talk about it tonight, honey. -Mom, wait.
-But we will talk about it tonight, honey. -Mom, wait.
-What? -Turn around.
-Make good choices, okay? -Said the boy who got suspended. [chuckles] I love you, honey.
[chuckles] I love you, honey. I love you too, Mom. More than I know.
[Mrs. Reed] Listen, while I'm out, lock up the back.
No ovens, no answering the door, no video games.
Hawking?
What is it? You see something?
-[whining] -Hawking, stop! Hawking!
[echoing] Hawking!
Whoa!
-[Hawking whimpers] -Oh my God. You scared the crap out of me.
-[rustling] -Who's there?
I don't think we should be out here.
We're okay.
-[barking] -Hawking!
Take it easy.
-Or, you know, fall down and scream. -[clattering]
-Jeez. Who the hell are you? -Put the bat down.
Put the bat down. I'm not gonna hurt you, I promise.
-What are you doing in here? -Mostly bleeding.
[sighs] Wait, how old are you?
-What? -How old are you?
Twelve.
[whispers] Twelve…
Shit!
-How did you get in my dad's garage? -I… It was open.
No, it wasn't. And that is a flight suit. Are you a pilot?
Yeah. Yeah, listen to me. Uh--
Don't-- Hey, don't call anyone. Put the phone down. I won't hurt you.
You said that already.
-Well, it bears-- God damn it! -[squelching]
Uh, it bears repeating. -[sighs] -That's a lot of blood.
Well… well, I have so much more in my body. Where's your mother?
On a date.
With who?
-What? -With who? What's his name?
-I don't know. Derek? -Derek?
Derek. Derek, Derek, Derek. That's, yes, the guy with the, um… with the mouth mullet.
-The goatee? -Yeah.
So say goatee.
-Yeah, he doesn't matter. -None of them matter.
Nice dog.
I'm gonna go inside the house.
I'm gonna get some stuff.
Hey, careful with that.
-Stay here. -[clattering]
[groans] Come on. Ah…
[grunts] Told you to stay in the garage.
And let some creepy dude just wander around my house alone?
-Yeah… -I don't think so.
Yeah, believe me. I don't wanna be here any more than you want me here.
I just gotta stop bleeding long enough.
Gotta dress the wound, prevent a nasty infection,
and I will be on my merry way.
Don't touch that.
-I was just looking. -Don't touch my stuff.
-Is this a lightsaber? -No, it's not.
-Okay. -No. Enough with the bat!
-Okay. -No. Enough with the bat! -[clattering] -If I wanted to hurt you, I would have.
If I'm being honest with myself, you have a very punchable face.
-Oh my-- -God! That--
Gah! That bullet went straight through. Good. -Cool. -Wait, wait, wait. Bullet? You were shot?
Yeah-- No, actually, no.
No, I was stabbed with a bullet. What do you think, you moron?
-I'm a moron? You're the one who was shot. -All right, okay, that's it. [coughs]
-[farting sound] -That… Wow… That, uh…
That's weird. It farts when I cough. -[coughs] -[farting sound]
-Gross. -Super gross.
I'm gonna go upstairs, grab some stuff. Stay cool. You can trust me.
Easy for you to say. I'm the one who ends up in a therapist's office,
Easy for you to say. I'm the one who ends up in a therapist's office, telling them about where the bad man touched me.
Oh God! That's where you go? Immediately? You are dark, man.
-[young Adam] Who even are you? -That is classified.
Why are you here?
-Also classi… classified. -Are you in the air force?
When I say "classified," what does your brain hear? Chocolate?
-What's with the lightsaber? -It's not a lightsaber.
Jesus Christ, Adam. -I need you to play it cool. -Wait.
-I know playing it cool isn't your thing. -Wait. -It never has been-- -Wait, wait! How do you know my name?
-It never has been-- -Wait, wait! How do you know my name?
You're Adam Reed. Born February 10th, 2010.
Your parents are Ellie and Louis Reed. Louis would've died about a year ago.
You don't play any sports because of acute asthma. -Plus you're freakishly small for 12. -[frantic barking]
You go to Franklin Middle School,
where you've been suspended two, three times for fighting,
which is ironic because you can't fight to save your life.
[in unison] Hawking! Zip it!
How do you know my dog's name? Because I named him.
-Where are you goin'? -[gasps]
-[wheezing] -Oh God.
[shakes inhaler] All right.
Here, ready? Deep breath.
Hold it.
Three, two, one.
Everybody gets a trophy.
When I was seven,
I ran into a table on the patio.
I got 12 stitches.
[in unison] Right here.
You knew how to get into my dad's garage.
You knew how to close the fridge.
You knew how to time my breathing. We have the same scar.
And you're wearing my dad's watch.
This watch.
This watch.
You're me.
Holy shi--
That's classified. But yes…
I once was.
I can't believe you're future me. Okay, you came to terms with that pretty quickly.
It's a little disturbing, actually.
-So why are you here? -Rescue mission.
I wasn't supposed to land here. I was aiming for 2018.
-I need to get there as soon as possible. -Who were you trying to save in 2018?
Really?
Fine. Can you at least tell me how you got here?
I'll show ya.
What was that?
-Crap. -What?
Uh, we're gonna switch to plan A, which is where you come in. You see, time jets, like all tech in the future,
You see, time jets, like all tech in the future, is coded to its user's DNA.
Because I'm injured… aah, the jet won't even clear me to fly,
which means I can't get in there to fix her.
But guess who can?
There she is.
[Adam] Away we go.
Okay. Sit down.
-Oh my God. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sit down.
Let's see what we're dealing with here. All right, some minor shield damage.
Let's see what we're dealing with here. All right, some minor shield damage. -Coolant leaks. -[beeping]
I don't know what that is, but when is a flashing red light ever good?
I know you wanna touch all the pretty buttons
with your sticky little child fingers, but the reactor has a quantum signature.
You fire it up, they can find us.
If they're here.
Who are "they"?
I'm glad that you didn't ask me that because "they" are classified.
-I already know you're from the future. -Believe me, I regret that.
I had no intention of coming back to revisit… this.
Jesus. Okay.
Okay, I've isolated the damaged relays,
so the ship should be able to start repairing itself.
How long will that take?
Ah, it's at 50% capacity, so hopefully less time than it takes me to heal.
[young Adam] Wait.
-Do you remember this? -Remember what?
This. Right here, right now.
You being here in 2022? -Know where you're going with this. -If this is happening to me--
-Know where you're going with this. -If this is happening to me-- -You're wasting your time. -That means it already happened to you.
-You're wasting your time. -That means it already happened to you.
Unless it works like a multiverse,
where each ripple creates an alternate timeline-- It's not a multiverse!
My God, we watched too many movies.
I just wanna know.
Okay.
Okay, the prevailing wisdom is that when I go back to my fixed time,
my memory… our memories, they reform, they reconcile.
-But not while I'm here. -Fixed time? What's that?
There's only one place in time where you belong on a quantum level,
where you're not screwing around with the cosmos like I am.
That is your fixed time. Where you actually belong.
So by being here and telling me this, you may have just changed my whole future?
Honestly? Your future is pretty tragic either way.
[laughs] I'm kidding! I'm kidding.
I'm not kidding.
I'm kidding. Let's go. Come on. Here we go.
[young Adam] So what happens now?
Nothin'. I'm just gonna lay down. Let this bullet wound heal.
Think about some key investment opportunities for your future.
-Wait, like Biff from Back to the-- -Are you out of your tiny mind?
Get back in the house before our mother gets home, and don't make it weird.
-[sniffles] -Hey. [frustratedly] Yes?
-This is amazing. -Isn't it, though?
Mind hitting the light on your way out?
Oh, hey. I'm surprised you're still up.
Well, this night's been full of surprises, mother. That's chilling. What happened?
How was your not-a-date? Will you be seeing him again?
-No. I don't know. I don't think so. -[knocking at door]
-Hi. -Hi.
-Me again. -Yes, it is.
You left your scarf in my car.
-I did. Gosh, thanks. -[Derek] Oh, hey there, kiddo.
Oh. This is my son, Adam. Adam, this is Derek.
Oh, hey, Adam.
Hello. You have a wonderful mouth mullet. You must be very proud.
Oh my gosh, Adam. [laughs]
-Never heard it called that before. -Well, thanks again.
Sure. See you soon.
Unlikely, but I'll put in a good word for you. Okay. Okay. I'll see you at work.
Okay. Okay. I'll see you at work.
-[Derek] Yeah. -Bye.
He seems nice.
What?
You can be a real jerk sometimes.
You know that? [sighs]
Hey there. Good morning.
Shouldn't you be at work?
Yeah, I need to pay the insurance on the house today.
Had it in the calendar, but I can't find the statement.
[Adam] With that filing system?
Shocking. It should all be online.
The minute I find myself with a few extra hours, I will set up those accounts.
Until then, this is how your dad did it.
Hey, grab a pile.
Sorry. I gotta get to my room to think about what I've done.
Okay. I gotta go.
Call me if you need me.
[Adam] I won't.
Mom's gone to work.
-Dad's favorite song. -♪ There's only one thing ♪

[laughs] It exists. Isn't that crazy?
Every conceptual idea you have about the universe has just been thrown out the window.
Yet your big question is, "Do I get laid?"
-Do I? -[Adam] Jesus Christ.
-I was just wondering. -[Adam] Wonder in silence.
-♪ Let my love open the door ♪ -Oh my God! It's gonna happen!
-Where you goin'? -Drugstore.
I need to get this wound closed up.
You're gonna go dressed like that?
Why don't you wear some of Dad's clothes?
How long ago was Dad's accident?
About a year and a half ago.
She still hasn't cleaned out his closet.
She's not much of a housekeeper.
Hey. You have her to take care of you. She has no one. You understand?
Do you understand?
She wakes up every morning with a broken heart and a closet full of his clothes
and gets nothing from you but a fistful of crap, and not even, like, ten seconds of genuine empathy.
I'm you, you know.
Tell me about it.
You know, 30 years, you still get sick to your stomach every time you remember how you treated her now.
I used to love this jacket. Dad did too.
I keep waiting to wake up and miss him less, but that hasn't happened yet.
Do you still miss him?
Missed him while he was here.
-It's not gonna fit you. -Sure it will.
-[bleeping] -[young Adam] How's the jet?
It's gettin' there.
So the person you came to save is in 2018.
And somehow, you ended up in 2022. How does that work? You just missed?
Well, I got shot when I was stealing the plane.
So, uh… I was losin' blood. Ship was comin' apart.
I jammed the coordinates. I didn't have time to double-check 'em.
-Wait, you stole the jet? -It's encoded to me.
So I didn't exactly steal it. I borrowed the shit out of it.
-There's a difference. Give me some cash. -You don't have money?
-There's a difference. Give me some cash. -You don't have money? -We don't use money in the future. -Really?
-We don't use money in the future. -Really?
Of course we use money in the future. Stay here.
[Chuck laughs] What's up, Reed?
Crap.
Well, look who we have here.
Ray, can we just take a break from the ass kicking today?
I have a lot going on.
Hey, guys. Enjoying our suspension? I am now.
[young Adam groans] That's my spleen.
I remember these little turd-burpers.
-Hey, man, we're, uh… just playin' around. -Quiet, Ray. This isn't about you.
Chuck.
Hey, what's goin' on? Huh?
Get it together. Ray's ready. You're embarrassing yourself.
So you're not gonna break this up?
God, no. That'd be irresponsible of me.
You'll just figure out some other way to pound the crap out of him. You always do.
He's got a big mouth. I get it. Point is, this fight needs to happen right now.
So just give us a second, okay, Ray?
Stretch out. You don't wanna pull a hammy.
What are you doing?
Hey, Ray Dollarhyde has been bullying you for years because you're small, and fragile, and you have a big mouth.
because you're small, and fragile, and you have a big mouth. But here's the thing. He doesn't wanna fight.
-I don't wanna fight either. -He doesn't know that, does he?
So you're gonna walk over there, and you're gonna raise your hands,
and then you're gonna look Ray right in the eye.
You're gonna smile in a way that says, "I've waited my entire life for this moment."
Like you can't wait to watch his soul exit his body.
Then you're gonna drop to your knees and punch him hard in the private bathing suit parts.
-I'm sorry, the what now? -Ah! Are we gonna smoke this banana?
-I'm sorry, the what now? -Ah! Are we gonna smoke this banana? Or are we gonna talk about it all day? Let's go, go, go, go, go.
I'm gonna smoke your banana, motherf--
No, no, no, no! No. That… that's not what we talked about.
-[groans] -[Ray] Boom! [laughing] Oh yeah!
-[Chuck] Nice, man. -[Ray] You crying, Reed?
Oh no, Chuck. Look, we made him cry.
[Chuck] It's like he was trying to lose.
Run away, Reed!
-What the hell? -I'm not supposed to do this.
-What the hell? -I'm not supposed to do this. Ever hear the expression, "Every bully has a bully"?
Yours isn't holding up his end of the bargain, so I'm gonna take over.
-What are you talking about? -[shushes]
You're a good fighter. You like to kick ass. You're a big kid.
But if you go near Adam again, I'll know, and I will find you, Ray.
And it won't be like a couple of kids in a playground scrap.
I will pull bones out of your body. I will sharpen them.
-I will use them to stab little Chuckie. -What did I do?
Shut your mouth, or I'll fill it with Ray's feet.
You understand what I'm saying? Got all of it? The bones? -Yeah. -Your feet in Chuckie's mouth?
-[liquid running] -Good. Are you peeing right now? -Yeah. -You're a real streamer.
Get yourself home and clean yourself up.
Be the change you wanna see, okay?
God, I hated those assholes.
Oh, come on.
Hey, Adam.
Get out of my stuff and open the door.
Put the drone down. It will kill us both.
Hey, look, you lost one fight. I figured you'd be used to that by now.
You coulda helped. You just stood there.
Christ. You're so sensitive.
Hey, you had to lose that fight.
You had to. Trust me.
You don't go from bein' you to bein' me without gettin' your ass kicked, a lot, all the time.
I'm sorry if I went too far today.
Shouldn't have done that.
-[young Adam] Who's this? -Who's who?
Put that back.
You put that back.
As soon as you tell me who she is.
That's my wife, Laura.
We have a wife?
No, we do not have a wife anymore.
-[Ellie] Hey. -Hi.
-[man] Aah. Hi, there. How are you? -Hey, Paul.
[Paul] Been a while.
[Ellie] Yep, how you doin'? That baby sleeping yet?
Uh, not really. No.
[chuckles] No. Well, you'll miss those days when they're gone.
Ah, I find that hard to believe.
[Ellie] Believe it. Babies are pure love.
They grow into teenagers, who grow into be assassins of happiness.
Thank you, thank you.
Mm, well, somethin' to look forward to. [chuckles]
Sorry. It's been a rough day.
Year. Couple of years.
Hmm. Your boy still havin' a hard time?
He hates me.
It's not his fault. He's… he's just dealing.
It's fine. We'll be fine. It's good. Good, good, good.
I wish I knew what I was doin' wrong. You're not doin' anything wrong.
Sorry. [laughs]
-I'm sorry. -[laughing] Sorry, you scared me.
-I was eavesdropping. I'm sorry. -Yeah.
[chuckles] You're right, though. Teenage boys are horrible.
It's like living with a urinal cake that yells at you.
Mothers are usually the ones who take the hit.
Yeah.
-But I'll tell you somethin'. -Mmm?
Boys always come back for their mamas.
That's nice.
It sounds like you're speaking from experience.
I am.
You have a good mom? -[Adam] I do. -Oh.
[whispers] I have the best mom.
Good.
I hope you're right.
I'm still researching boarding schools in Fallujah, so…
-Good. -[both laugh]
No, I don't mean that. He's such a sweet kid.
I'm crazy about him.
We lost his dad in a car accident year before last.
Yeah. That's tough.
Yeah. You have no idea.
Well, I have some idea.
-Oh, sorry. -Sorry.
Jinx.
-Thank you. -[Adam] Thank you.
Aren't you grieving too?
-Yeah. -[Adam] Yeah.
I am. Of course I am.
So tell him. You should tell him.
I don't think he needs it.
You think you're being strong for him,
and the problem with acting like you have it all together is… he believes it.
Maybe he needs to know that you don't.
It's okay if you don't.
My husband had a jacket just like that.
Oh, this is a classic.
Yeah.
It was really nice chatting with you. I'll see you later.
Oh, hey, um…
he doesn't hate you.
He loves you.
More than he knows.
Hey! Hey!
Locked and docked.
Start the area scans for his jet. Let's find him and get the hell outta here.
Find him.
-So you came back for your wife, Laura? -We're not getting into that.
Hey, she's my wife too.
-You know what? We should get into that. -Thank you.
Met in the academy.
She was 20 minutes late to the wrong classroom
in the wrong building.
I offered to walk her to the right one, and…
man, I was all in before we even made it outside.
A couple of years ago, she didn't come back from a jump.
They told me her jet broke up on reentry, but she was the best pilot in the program.
She wrote the book on reentry. Didn't make sense.
And you were trying to get to 2018 'cause that's where she went before?
Yeah.
-What was she doing there? -I don't know.
They changed the jump logs.
Somebody was hidin' somethin'. Maybe she saw something Sorian didn't want her to see.
Wait, "Sorian"? Maya Sorian, Dad's partner? -She was always so nice to me. -Hmm.
Yeah, trust me. She's no friend.
Nope.
After Dad died, she got rich off of his tech. Bought all the right people.
Next thing you know, she has exclusive control over the most valuable resource on Earth,
time.
Wait a minute. You're saying Dad invented time travel?
Yeah. Not on purpose.
The magnetic particle accelerator. Remember that?
He called it The Adam Project.
[Adam] Yeah, or as I like to call it, his favorite child.
So what happened to Laura?
Mmm. Well, I think your nice friend Maya had her killed.
-What? -Yeah.
That's why I gotta get back to 2018 as soon as possible. The jet's almost ready. I'll lay low in the shed.
The jet's almost ready. I'll lay low in the shed. I'll heal for a few more days until I can get a clean read
and then fly out of your life.
But going back to save her. -Talking to me. -[whines]
Everything you're doing right now just to rescue one person.
You're changing the future. That's gotta be against the rules.
You'll feel differently when you meet her.
-And when you lose her. -What?
[shushes] Grab that bag. Get ready to run.
Why? What's happening?
We're going that way. Be ready.
-Move! -[whooshing]
Stay behind me. [exhales]
Don't you do it! Don't you do it, Reed!
Wanna see something cool?
-That's a lightsaber, dude. -Quiet now.
Time to go. Let's go.
[Sorian] Hello, Adam.
[man] Reed, don't move!
[Adam] Christos. They'll let anyone into this time stream.
Who's that?
That's Christos. We were in the academy together.
He's a decent pilot but a terrible person. He runs security for Sorian.
Ouchie, with the face. Did I do that?
God, I hope the boss lets me kill you. [chuckles] In fairness, though, you did shoot me first.
On the bright side, your… your face now matches your soul.
-Anyone say you talk too much? -All the time.
-It's come up. -[Sorian] That's enough.
Adam, before this goes any further, let's just go home, please.
Uh, no! Just… just no.
So you're risking your own young life
over some paranoid delusion that I somehow killed Laura.
I loved Laura. You were both like family to me.
I would never have hurt her. I hate that it's come to this.
Guns.
Christos, please escort Adam back to 2050.
-You're up. -Yeah. All right, drop the Mag-Cyl.
-This? -Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay. -All right.
Wanna start low or go high?
-[young Adam] Stop! Get off him! -[Adam groans]
-[guns power up] -[Christos] Come here!
-Move! -♪ I was told what it means ♪
-What is happening? -Dying outside your fixed time is messy.
-What are you doing here? -Saving your ass, honey. Behind you!
I can't believe…
-I can't believe you're here. -♪ Good times, bad times ♪
-Hey. -Hi.
That was awesome.
-We should go. -Yep. Let's go. Come on, come on, come on!
Go. Go!
I knew you'd come someday. I just didn't know when.
[Adam] Of course I came.
[young Adam] Eyes on the road, please.
[Adam] They said you lit up on reentry.
That's crap. I have the top reentry stats in the program.
-Oh yeah. -[young Adam coughing]
Laura, this is… me.
-Hi. -Parallel contact, babe?
Well, you've always said that you wished you'd met me earlier. -Here I am. -Yeah.
All right, can we maybe slow down a bit now? There's no one even following us.
Don't look back. Look up.
[Adam] Gotta get off this road. We're too exposed.
Okay, baby, it's about to get busier.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Stop the car.
-What? -What?
-Stop! -[Laura yells]
Okay, back, back. Go, go, go! Reverse!
Back! Back!
Go, go, go, go!
They're leaving.
They're not leaving. They're regrouping.
-We have to get off this road fast. -[young Adam] What road?
[Adam] I… I don't understand. How did you find us?
[Laura] You don't think I'd be watching your back, even in the past?
[Adam] Why did you make the jump back in the first place?
I was analyzing data when I found something strange in the jump logs.
A time jet returning from 2018.
How's that strange?
Because no one ever flew to 2018.
[Adam] I don't get it. How did it come back if it never left?
Unless someone went back and altered the time stream,
so the future the jet had left from had already been changed.
God, it's like I traded my brains for those muscles.
It's a shit deal.
-Cute kid. -Precious, isn't he?
Don't you just wanna hold him underwater till the bubbles stop? -[chuckles] -Oh, I freakin' hate myself.
How did this happen?
[Laura] That jet that went back? It was Sorian's.
She went back to November 2018 for a reason.
What happened in November 2018?
I'll tell ya. [sighs]
This happened.
Your father's magnetic particle accelerator,
The Adam Project, had just gone online.
That was the first step toward practical time travel.
Sorian must've come back to 2018 and given her younger self some kind of future intel.
What for?
My guess is enough future stock tips to amass her fortune
and get rid of whatever political obstacles were keeping her from gaining control of the time program.
She already had that.
But did she?
No.
No, she didn't.
No.
So this world, our world, everything has already been changed by Sorian.
And your fixed time, 2050, is it bad there?
-We've seen Terminator, right? -Obviously.
That's 2050 on a good day.
Sorian must've spotted me and planted an altitude bomb on my jet.
Here, eat something.
-I managed to eject, but it didn't matter. -[mouths]
-I managed to eject, but it didn't matter. -[mouths] Without my jet, I was a permanent castaway.
So I had to follow protocol, you know, live out my life here,
avoid contact, minimize my footprint,
and hope you were crazy enough to come look for me.
Alone. All this time.
Four years.
That's the job, right?
-Yeah, but, baby-- -It's…
It's fine. I got used to being alone.
Not anymore.
-[sighs] -[Adam] Hey.
I found you.
-[Laura chuckles] -I found you.
You found me.
-I'll take my eyes and ears for a walk. -[Adam] Bye now.
[young Adam] You kids have fun.
-[sighs] Hey. -Hi.
-What's wrong? -I got shot.
-You got shot? -By a gun, yeah.
-Reed? -Yeah?
-Suck it up. -Yes, ma'am.
[whispers] Yes, boss.
-You know what you have to do. -Nooooo. No, I came back for you.
I know.
But we can't have a life here. Not like this.
Now you have to go back to 2018, and you have to put things right.
-You have to put an end to all this. -What do you mean "put an end to it"?
I mean, stop time travel from ever being invented and save the future.
Fine, come with me, and we'll--
Your jet is meshed for your DNA. It won't fly with anyone else.
-You're smart. You can figure it out. -Adam!
We meet in the program. We meet there. Do you understand that? We can't…
If I go back and stop time travel, and that's an extremely big "if" with Sorian on my ass,
and that's an extremely big "if" with Sorian on my ass,
we never meet. We never happen.
We never happen, Laura.
We did happen.
Every moment we ever had will always have happened.
Even if we correct the time stream,
somewhere in us will be the echo of this one.
And we will find each other.
I really believe that.
What if we don't? What if… what if you're wrong? And you're probably wrong.
When am I ever wrong?
-Hey, hey. -[sobs] I can't do this again, okay?
I can't do this again, please. I can't afford to lose you. Don't do this.
What is that?
They found us.
[gasping] Damn it!
There's a dirt road around the bend. -I'll buy you time to get to your jet. -No, no, no. Hey. I'm not leaving.
-I'll buy you time to get to your jet. -No, no, no. Hey. I'm not leaving.
-You have to. -What are you talking about? -Those guys'll kill you. -No! I've had years--
-Those guys'll kill you. -No! I've had years-- I've had years to rig my defenses. They'll never see me coming.
-If they catch you, it's over. -That's the only reason--
Adam! Stop it! Please. [sobs]
I know you came for me.
[sobbing] Now you have to leave for me, please.
Please.
[whispers] We can fix this.
Hey, I love you.
That's why I know you're gonna find me again.
Go.
Go!
God damn it!
Come on.
Come on.
Boom.
[Adam] Jet's not reading me because of my vitals. I'll need your DNA to start her up.
When we get to altitude, the bio stop will come down, and then I can take over.
We have to move fast, or they'll be on us before we can jump to 2018.
-Wait. What? I'm not coming with you. -Yes, you are. Let's go. We need to go.
[Laura] Christos!
-[panting] -It's good to see you, buddy.
Laura, is that you?
You're not still mad at me for blowing up your jet, are you?
If I'm being honest, yeah, I'm still kinda pissed.
Will you stop and listen to me?
This is my fixed time. You already had my childhood.
You had adventures, you flew planes, and I'm still the nerd with an inhaler who gets his ass kicked.
I want the rest of it. -Want the rest? -Yeah.
Here's the rest of it. Dad's death screws you up more than you ever realize.
You get depressed. You get angry.
You wander around school without making a social dent.
College is a high point, until after a year, you lose your scholarship
for something that is so unbelievably stupid
I cannot even say it out loud right now.
You end up in the air force. Turns out you could really fly.
And then along comes time travel, and the whole world starts to fall apart
until the only woman you have… the only woman you ever loved gets taken away.
Do you understand me?
Till you lose…
She… she just gets taken away.
-There's gotta be more than that. -[Adam] There is, kid.
-There's gotta be more than that. -[Adam] There is, kid. And thanks to Sorian, none of it's good.
We can fix it.
-By destroying time travel? -That's right.
How are we gonna do that? What's your plan?
I'm not gonna explain my plan to a nerd with an inhaler--
-You don't have a plan. -Because I do not have a plan. -Exactly. -That is correct.
But I know somebody who might.
Dad.
Dad.
You're gonna find Dad. [Adam] Nope.
We're gonna find Dad.
So are you in or are you--
Tell your husband to get his bitch ass out here.
He's busy right now,
but I'll tell him you stopped by.
Hello, Laura.
You should have stayed dead the first time.
Now, where is your husband?
[Adam panting] Okay.
Here we go. All right, give me your hand.
-[whirring] -Like that, yep.
Nice, healthy DNA right there.
Okay, we'll park it down there,
grab on to that railing,
hold on for dear life, and try not to pass out from the G's, okay?
What's a… Jesus!
-What's happening? -That.
[young Adam yelps] What are you doing?
Gotcha! Hang on.
I told you to hang on.
Don't give me that stink eye.
Where you going?
Shit!
[Adam] Okay, hold tight. I've always wanted to try this.
[young Adam] Did you just turn the plane off?
[Adam] Yes, I did. [young Adam] Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,
[young Adam] Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!
Where the hell are they?
-[Christos] They gotta be here somewhere. -[Sorian] Adam, check your ion readings.
The reactor's damaged.
You have one jump left.
If you don't come back now, you never will.
What do you say, kid? Your call.
We don't pull this off, we're not gettin' back, either one of us.
-Punch that shit. -Oh yeah!
Gotcha.
-♪ Well, my temperature's rising… ♪ -Come on!
-♪ Crazy people knockin'… ♪ -Adam! I got this.
Come on, Reed. Come on.
-[young Adam] Adam! -[Adam] I got it! -Adam! -I got it!
-[young Adam] Adam! -♪ So glad we made it… ♪
Come on!
-Let's not… -[alarm bleeping]
Die!
[man] It's not meant to be easy.
Listen, guys, instead of moaning about it,
give yourself permission to be inadequate, and then get to work.
You can't be good at something unless you're willing to be… -[blows raspberry] …at it first. -[laughter]
-Professor Reed. -Sophie.
It'll take two semesters just to begin solving that. [Louis] Oh, good God, at least that.
[Sophie] Even then, we'll fail the class, because this is bonkers.
[Louis] Sophie, you can do this.
Listen, guys, that is the beauty of physics.
[voice fading] That is the beauty of life…
It's really him.
-Yep. -[Louis] If you think you've got…
He's so… [Adam] Yeah.
Alive. Come here for a second. Hey.
-Let me do the talking in there. -We have to tell him what happens.
-Let me do the talking in there. -We have to tell him what happens. -He doesn't have to die. -We say nothing, okay?
-He doesn't have to die. -We say nothing, okay?
Only what he needs to know. Everything else… we can't.
I wanna hear you say it, "I won't tell him." Say it.
-Say it. -I won't tell him.
Physics is a slog. It's a slog.
We are meant to work on problems that our children will solve.
You might find the odd solution here or there.
I just got your shirt, by the way. It's very clever.
But you will die before your life's work is done.
Your cold, lifeless husk will be moldering in the ground
while generations that come after you will be finishing the work that you started.
To quote the Romans,
"Enjoy yourselves. It's later than you think."
[Adam] Guy Lombardo.
-I am s… I'm sorry? -[Adam] Guy Lombardo. That was… Yeah.
The quote, um… "It's later than you think." It's not the Romans.
It's a singer. Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians.
It was Guy Lombardo,
and it was from his 1949 classic, "Enjoy Yourself."
But long before that,
it was the Romans who etched it on their sundials.
So, uh… so we're both right.
It's interesting that you, uh… you know that.
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Just auditing the class. [chuckles]
Any other questions?
All right, the, uh, reading's on my website, and I'll see you Tuesday.
Adam?
Dad.
Dad.
[Louis] Adam?
Is… is this time travel?
-[Louis] He came from 2050 and got you? -[young Adam] Yes.
-How old are you now? -[young Adam] Twelve.
-Why did you need your 12-year-old self? -[Adam] I didn't.
-You needed me to fly the jet. -Jet? There… there's a jet?
-My jet. -Oh. What I meant was I didn't need you originally.
-2022 was a mistake. -Wh--
And you flew this jet?
-Yes. -Did you, though?
-Yes. -Did you, though? -Is that my jacket? Looks tight on you. -That's what I said.
-Is that my jacket? Looks tight on you. -That's what I said. -It's fine. -Like a condom with buttons.
-It's fine. -Like a condom with buttons. -This is fun. I'm having fun, are you? -Condom!
And why was 2022 a mistake?
-I wasn't supposed to be there. -You're not supposed to be here.
-You don't say. -They shot him when he stole the jet.
-You don't say. -They shot him when he stole the jet. -Please don't tell him that. -You stole a jet?
-Why would he need to know that? -Okay, stop. Both of you stop talking now.
Do you realize how absolutely wrong this is?
You can't be here. You can't be anywhere but your own timeline.
What do you think we're doin' here? Think we're short of hugs in the future?
-There's a reason I need to talk to you. -I don't-- I don't care.
-He doesn't care. -Don't get me wrong.
I'm very happy to see you, and I mean this in the best possible way,
but you need to piss off to where you came from.
Anything you say or do could cause a divergence.
Can you please shut up for a second?
-I'm not gonna listen-- -For a second and listen.
-Shut the physics fountain in your face. -What you are doing is reckless.
-Dad! -[groans]
[young Adam] You okay?
-God damn it! -[groaning]
-[Adam] In fairness, I-- -It's okay. I asked him nicely to shut up and listen.
-He did no such thing, so… -It's okay. It's fine. I'm fine.
That's what you get. We don't hit people in this family.
What was that?
-That's what you get. -God!
How did you turn out to be an asshole? I thought you loved me.
-I do! -None of it matters anymore.
-Are you kidding me? Of course it matters. -Dad.
They don't have safeguards where you come from? -Dad. -Protocols?
-Maya and I agreed. -Dad.
-There'd be an ethics panel-- -Dad!
With real oversight. None of it matters anymore.
Wait. It already happened? Somebody already altered time?
-Who? -Sorian.
-Maya? -Maya.
She'd never do that. She knows the consequences.
-She's been funding my work for years. -The Adam Project.
Yes, I theorized that with a powerful enough pulse, we could generate utilitarian wormholes in space.
And we did it four weeks ago. But I was… I was just playing with the theory
that you can use wormholes for time travel.
That part's theoretical.
-Right. -Still theoretical.
This theory needs to take a leak. So let's go.
Holy shit! I'm the godfather of time travel?
Nice hit, Dad. [whispers] I think I broke my hand.
[Louis] I'm… I'm sorry. This is my fault.
My… my ego. My hubris.
My need to be best, to be first, to be the smartest guy in the room. And here we are.
-A disgusting character flaw. -He didn't know.
-[Louis] But I should have. -Yeah.
Mankind has no business tampering with the mechanics of the universe.
There are forces greater than science.
Right. That's why we're gonna put the genie back in the bottle.
Destroy time travel before it's even invented.
What's done, no matter how terrible,
should not and cannot be undone under any circumstance.
Even us being here, talking like this, we're perverting fate and time.
I told you Sorian already did that. She's had the world by the balls since.
And you know that for a fact?
Do you have scientific proof that she changed things?
No, you don't because you can't know. But I will tell you this.
You being here opens up the potential for catastrophic reconfiguration.
-And that is quantifiable, that-- -Stop. Stop.
-And that is quantifiable, that-- -Stop. Stop. -Stop. -Stop what?
-Stop being a scientist. -But I am a scient--
Be a father.
You were always more interested in the universe than your son.
-That's not true. -[Adam] That is true.
And when you're older, you'll realize that. It--
You know what? It's…
That ship has sailed. It's too late for me. So, you know, whatever. I'm fine.
But he needs you.
And you? What do you need?
I need to go for a walk.
I can't be here, Adam. I… I have to go.
-Please don't go. -I have to.
-Please. -This is… this is bigger than any of us.
-Please. -This is… this is bigger than any of us. It's too dangerous what he's asking me to do. I can't.
All right. We'll see each other again.
Wait.
-I need to tell you something. -No, you can't say anything else to me.
I can't know the future.
I'm sorry.
I have to go home. Your mom and you are waiting.
[woman] Yes, Senator.
Except the stability of these wormholes is no longer a hypothetical,
and the work we are doing here is simply ahead of the current statutes.
So you can either support my program and be a part of the future,
or you can get left behind in the past.
[Sorian] Hang up the phone.
What are you doing here? You said I wouldn't be seeing you again.
Did I? Hmm.
When was that? Remind me.
[Maya] The last time you just showed up, two months ago.
Oh, well, for me, it was 32 years ago.
So sorry if I'm a little fuzzy on the details.
Anyway, times have changed.
You can't be here.
You know the potential for catastrophic changes to the time stream.
-It's incalculable. -God, I was such a nerd.
Will you please just stop talking? Everything you asked me to do.
The stock buys, the offshore accounts, all of it. It's unethical.
-And illegal. -This isn't a joke. It's dangerous.
The environmental impact alone from the companies you had me pick
could be devastating.
In fairness to us, the environment was pretty much toast before we came along.
And by the way, Maya, you did it, all of it,
because somewhere inside that cheap suit and ridiculous ponytail is me.
I'm leaving. Where you going?
You seeing someone?
No, you're not. You're too busy.
[clicks tongue] Thing is, you always will be.
This company is all you will ever have. -[sighs] -It is your personal life.
It's your family.
But this is our legacy.
And if we had let the government take it from us,
then everything we sacrificed,
all that loneliness,
all that loneliness,
would've been for nothing.
And I did it.
I fixed that future where we had been forgotten.
Then why are you back here now?
I'm back because we can't control time travel if it never existed.
And your buddy Adam Reed is about to betray you.
Adam? He's just a little kid.
Yeah, well, that little kid…
[laughs] …he grows up to be a very big pain in our ass.
[sighs] Trust me. You're gonna want this.
What?
I know you think you know more than me because you're older.
Go away, Adam. [sighs]
And I know why you hate him so much.
Really?
[laughs] Well, do tell. I'm on the edge of my seat here.
Holy shit. I wonder what it i-- Was it because he's narcissistic,
or, uh, never came home from work or cared more about his job than his son--
It's because he died.
You hate him
because he died.
You made yourself hate him
because it was easier than missing him.
And I remember some stuff that you maybe don't wanna.
Oh yeah?
Like what?
He played catch with us almost every night.
Catch.
He'd get home from work,
be so tired, and I'd be in the yard throwing the ball against the pitch back.
-You remember the pitch back, right? -Oh, I… I remember the pitch back.
Yeah, he bought it so he didn't have to play with me.
Nope.
He bought it because they had one in the window of Altman's.
And every time we passed that store,
I begged him to buy it for me,
so that's what Dad did.
He'd see me throwin' in the yard, and no matter how tired he was,
he'd always grab his mitt to come out for a catch.
Things happened to you, to us.
And we suck at dealing with it.
I'm starting to think it's something we do. I give Mom a hard time now, and…
I think…
I think it's easier to be angry than it is to be sad.
And I guess, when I get older,
I forget that there's a difference.
How'd you get to be so smart?
How'd you get to be so dumb?
Nice try, asshole.
[Ellie] Adam, make sure you feed Hawking before you leave for school, honey.
-You're still here. -[Louis] Oh. And you're cooking. What are you making? Hi.
Uh, I know you like the Denver omelet.
That's not a Denver omelet. That is a cry for help.
The eggs are burnt, and the bacon's still somehow totally raw.
Oh, you… Oh, no, no. No, no, no. Wha--
Do you wanna talk about why you're still here instead of being at work?
I… I… Well, I just wanted to stay home with you today.
You don't say. I like this guy. This guy likes you.
What's going on with you, honey?
Does he seem, uh… does he seem sad to you?
No.
He's an odd duck, like his dad.
I happen to collect odd ducks.
I don't know if I should've built that game for him. Shouldn't he be outside, playing with the rest of the kids?
How is he gonna find his place in the world?
"His place in the world"? He's a kid. We're his place in the world.
You're his place in the world.
[sighs] Okay, whatever is going on, listen, I can tell you the truth
or something that's gonna make you feel better.
I'd rather cut to it and tell you the truth, if you're up for it.
I… I'd rather something that'll make me feel better.
I… I'd rather something that'll make me feel better. [laughs] Yeah, I know.
Kidding. Sort of. Okay, tell me.
When you are with us… [clicks tongue]
…you're with us 100%.
It's amazing.
And when you're not… [laughs] …it's like… pfft.
So is he a little lonely?
Yeah, probably. But does that make you a shitty guy? No.
I've gotta do better.
Hey, buddy, I have good news for you.
He doesn't need perfect. He just needs you.
Your cooking makes you a borderline serial killer,
but the rest of you is pretty awesome.
Ellie.
You know I love you.
Yeah, I know.
I'm extremely lovable.
Yeah.
I have to go to work.
Okay, okay, okay.
-And, hey, you got time. -[sighs]
"It's later than you think."
[young Adam] Really think we can? Maybe, maybe not. We'll see.
But we're gonna try anyway. Destroy time travel. How will we do that?
This is the world's largest electromagnetic accelerator.
It's 2018, so EM technology isn't stable yet.
So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna blow this bitch up.
-Blow it up? -Yep.
How did I live this long? That's a terrible idea.
Yeah, well, when a bad idea is the only idea, it becomes a great idea.
Who said that?
You. Nine years from now, right before you get arrested.
-What? -Try to focus.
We'll have to deal with security. You know this bag of toys you love?
Yeah. Being a geek is about to pay off.
-Reading me? -[young Adam] Roger that, Red Leader.
This is Butternut Sippy Cup. Ten-four, over.
Let's just talk like normal people, okay?
[young Adam] Copy that…
Red Leader.
Somethin's wrong.
There's nobody here.
Which means they're here.
Sorian warned her younger self we were coming. Are you sure?
Oh, pretty sure.
-Don't move. On your knees. -I'm sorry. What?
We're taking you back to 2050, Reed.
I can't hear you through the helmet. It muffles a bit. It's hard to hear you.
Don't get me wrong, your outfits are incredible though.
They're intimidating but also scream, "Please don't hurt me."
[soldier] On your knees. I won't tell you again.
Well, you… you're right about that.
Adam, what are you doing? I'm about to get my ass kicked.
Don't worry. He doesn't wanna fight.
They wanna fight. They really, really wanna fight.
Just look him in the eyes and smile.
Smile in a way that says, "I want this."
"I've been waiting my whole life for this."
Then hit him in the private bathing suit parts.
-Adam! -Roger that. Pyeow!
Yeah!
Adam, you're on those cars, right?
Roger that, middle-aged Adam.
Bye. Pfft.
Adam!
That was invigorating!
-Dad? -Dad?
-I'm sorry. Are you okay? -This close!
-That was amazing. -This close!
-Where's little Adam? -He's fine!
-Hey, hey! -Hey? That's your mother's car.
The car?
What are you doin' here?
I went to the motel, and when I didn't find you there,
I… I figured I'd find you here.
It's not like you're keeping a low profile, obviously.
What the hell is this?
Tell you what? You come up with a plan, and we'll do it your way. Sound good?
Oh God. Thank God. There's a plan.
I was beginning to think you were making this up as you went along.
Adam, I'm goin' inside. Cover the perimeter.
-No one gets in behind me. -Sorry. That was harsh.
Roger Dodger.
[Adam] Harsh? You shaved my ass with a Subaru.
I… I saved your ass with a Subaru, son.
What's Dad doing?
-Dad's being critical. Big surprise. -Okay, I--
You're trying to break into a highly sensitive, secure facility
with a sixth-grader. I am not being critical. I'm… I'm narrating.
Will you just stop? Stop. Where the hell are you going?
To destroy your accelerator, and I'm gonna enjoy it. Do you realize that you have broken every rule?
You've blown past every conceivable ethical boundary like it wasn't there.
Yeah? Then why are you here, Dad?
Because you can't do it without me.
Some people dream of the future.
Here at Sorian Technologies, we're building it.
[Louis] If you destroy the accelerator, Sorian will simply rebuild it.
-[Adam] So what will work? -[Louis] What you're after is ISPCA.
-[Adam] So what will work? -[Louis] What you're after is ISPCA. Infinitely Shifting Plasma Containing Algorithm,
which I designed to stabilize the wormholes.
That is the mathematical equation that will make time travel possible.
How do you destroy math?
I've never written the algorithm down or demonstrated it to another human being,
so it lives here in the old bean, and in the subbasement in a diamond-hard neuromorphic processor.
and in the subbasement in a diamond-hard neuromorphic processor.
Are you talking about your penis?
Can… can we be serious now?
Yes. No. Yes.
-It's a hard drive, okay? -[chuckles]
-God, you're such a child. -Sorry.
There is a crystal hard drive running the algorithm in a closed loop.
That is the nerve center of the accelerator.
So we go there, destroy the hard drive, prevent time travel from being invented.
Theoretically, time travel--
Oh my God! You're killing me with the theoretical.
-Yes, that should do it. -Good. Let's do that.
-Okay. Okay. -Okay. Okay. -Okay. -[whirring]
-This is where you work. -Yes.
Only took you 44 years to bring me here.
Fair.
I am so keeping this thing.
-[Adam] So this is it? -[Louis] This is it.
I gotta hand it to you, Dad. You were not messin' around.
This is where we house the hard drive.
-[Adam] What happens if you pull it out? -[Louis] One of two things.
The accelerator will continue to run on a dormant loop.
But without the algorithm, no one will ever be able to program it again.
Or?
Or there's a cataclysmic meltdown
that will destroy all living things within 100 miles.
Well, let's hope it's the first thing.
[computer] Neuromorphic hard drive panel accessed.
Screw it.
[Maya] Louis.
[Louis] Maya?
Long time no see.
Oh, this shit's about to get weird.
Were you really gonna steal that from us? Destroy everything we've worked for?
[Louis] Our work was supposed to have moral ground rules.
-We were gonna change the world. -Change the world?
The only thing that's changed is you. Have you lost your mind?
All these years, I funded your work.
I'm not the villain here. I spent millions--
Hundreds of millions of my money, my wealth.
Hundreds of millions of my money, my wealth. -Mmm. -Just to fund your every indulgence.
But this…
this is mine to do with as I please.
Now,
Adam,
give me… the drive.
No.
Just… no.
I thought you were gonna say that.
Come here.
Gimme the gun.
Maya, Jesus Christ.
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
Oh, I think that's well established.
Adam, just listen to her.
It's okay. It's all right.
'Cause Adam's gonna give me the drive right now.
Aren't you, Adam?
-Adam? -Adam?
[Sorian] Hey, beautiful idiot. If I shoot him, you die too.
[Louis] Adam?
I'm thinking it over.
-What? What do you mean you're thinking? -Yeah. -It's a complicated issue. -What is there to think over?
-It's a complicated issue. -What is there to think over? -It's a big decision! -No, it's not!
-It's not. -I need to think it through!
I'm about to lose my shit here!
-Give her the drive! -Give her the drive, man!
-Give her the drive! -[Maya] Please!
[computer] Electromagnetic seal compromised.
[computer] Commencing emergency protocols.
[soldier] Come here.
-Dad! -Adam!
[grunts] Hey! Let me go! [Louis] Adam, just hang on!
-[young Adam] Let me go! -Get me that drive! Now!
[computer] Access denied.
[young Adam] Get off me! Dad!
This way!
♪ I don't want no more ♪
Yeah.
-Get the drive! -The drive!
[whispers] Superhero landing.
Ever had your ass kicked by a 12-year-old nerd with an inhaler?
-Suppertime, Spanky. -No.
-[yelps] -No!
Finish him!
-[Christos] Come on! -[choking]
-[Sorian] Christos! -No!
[computer] Core breached.
Reactor stability compromised.
Commence evacuation.
Lockdown in two minutes.
Buddy, it's time to go. Come on.
I can't shut it down!
[Maya] Stop!
I want my drive.
You can't have it.
Shoot him now.
Get behind me, both of you.
Look, Dad, Dad, those guns shoot armor-piercing bullets. So even behind you, we're still Swiss cheese.
-Thanks for that information. -You're welcome.
-Maybe spread out a little. -Maybe a good idea.
[Louis] Maya, you're not a murderer. Not yet, anyway.
[Sorian] Listen to me.
Everything we've worked for,
it goes away unless you pull this trigger.
Okay, come on.
[computer] One minute 30 seconds until lockdown.
[Sorian] You can do it.
Do it!
Maya, you're better than this.
Sorry, Louis, but you brought this on yourself.
Maybe so.
You think I'm playing?
Ask your son how I play.
I had to kill his wife twice to protect the integrity of my program.
Now, don't think I won't put a bullet right through you.
Give it to me!
No.
[computer] One minute until lockdown.
You just never understood the bigger picture. [chuckles sadly]
And you never understood the science.
How did you know that would work?
Those armor-piercing rounds contain a magnetic steel core.
Sometimes it pays to be a nerd, guys.
[computer] Containment protocol initiated.
-Ten seconds remaining. -Whoa.
-Yeah, we should run. -Yep.
[computer] Nine.
Eight.
Seven.
[computer] Six.
-Five. -[Louis] Go! Four.
Three.
-[Louis yelling] Oh, shit! -[computer] Two.
One.
Well, I'd say Bring Your Kid to Work Day was a huge success.
-Uh-huh. -Yep.
-[Adam] What are you looking at? -[Louis] You're still here.
I figured after we eliminated time travel, you two would go back to your fixed times.
It probably takes a while for 30 years of changed time to sort itself out.
[young Adam] I don't think we have long.
I can feel somethin' happening. [Adam] Me too.
Sure it's okay for us to be here?
[Louis] It's fine. Your mom takes you to science club on Thursdays.
Look, um… Dad.
[sighs] There's somethin' we need to tell you. I… I already know.
I knew the moment I saw you.
I'm sorry, boys. I'm, uh…
I'm sorry that I'm… I'm not gonna be there for you down the road,
and I've given it a lot of thought,
but you cannot tell me how or when it happens.
You came back here because no one has a right to change the future, including us.
It's your future. No.
You're my future. Both of you.
And how lucky am I
that I got to see it?
I haven't been there for you. And I'm sorry.
But I saw you being born. I watched you take your first breath.
And after that happens, nothing is ever the same again.
You're my son, Adam, and I love you.
-You're my boy, and I love you. -Okay. You don't have to do all--
-You're my boy, and I love you. -Okay. You don't have to do all-- I loved you from the first minute that I saw you.
I loved you from the first minute that I saw you. -And that will never change. -I… I get that.
-Adam, you're my boy. -Dad? We really don't have to do all--
-You're amazing. -[Adam] Okay.
-I love you. -I get it, Dad.
I don't think you do.
-I am proud of you. -Okay.
[Louis] I love you, son.
Know that inside your heart. Know… Come here. Come here.
[Louis] You're my boys, and you'll always be my boys.
Throughout all time.
-[Adam sniffles] I love you, Dad. -[Louis] I love you, buddy.
[whispers] Don't carry this around anymore.
I need you, Dad.
It's so hard without you.
I know.
You're gonna be okay.
-You're gonna be better than okay. -You don't know that.
Are you kidding me? Have you seen this guy?
There's gotta be somethin' we can do. I can think of somethin'.
[Adam] You really gonna do this?
All right. All right. Can you do me a favor?
All right. Can you do me a favor?
I don't know if we're gonna remember any of this, but maybe there'll be an echo or somethin', like Laura said.
But just in case,
give Mom a hug for me.
Would you do that?
Not one of your lame-ass side hugs either.
I'm talkin' the break-a-rib kinda hug. Yeah?
Yeah.
Holy shit.
What?
I spent 30 years trying to get away from the me that was you.
And I'll tell you what, kid.
I hate to say it, but you were the best part all along.
-Are we gonna smoke this banana or sit-- -Play ball!
Hey there.
Aren't you late for work? Yeah. I need to pay the insurance on the house.
It's in the calendar, but I can't find the statement.
With that filing system? Shocking.
-Shocking. -[Adam] It should all be online.
[Ellie] This is how Dad did it. -Grab a pile, would you? -I'll be late for school.
-Grab a pile, would you? -I'll be late for school.
Oh my gosh. You're right. Okay. Have a great day, honey.
Adam.
[Adam] Yeah?
Just making sure I wasn't getting mugged.
Maybe you are.
Get over here! Get over here!
I love you, honey. Love you too.
[man] So, as I said earlier,
our goal is to calculate the variability of gravitational force,
which depends entirely on whether your path of motion
is toward the Earth or away from it.
So let's define the gravitational force of the Earth on an object
by Newton's gravitational formula.
F is equal to big G, Newton's gravitational constant,
-And r-- -Can you believe this guy?
He's been talking for 15 minutes. Managed to put the entire class to sleep.
You look awake. No. No, no, no, no, no.
I've trained myself to…  to fall fast asleep but keep my eyes open.
Check it out.
-Are you serious? -[snoring]
-Cool, right? -Yeah. -Yeah. -Super cool. [chuckles]
I'm Adam. Adam… Adam Reed.
Laura Shane.
-Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you too.
-I'll, um… I'll be quiet. -Okay.
-Where do they find these guest lecturers? -[snickering] Right?
It's like they're genetically engineered to bore us to death.
You're totally a guest lecturer, aren't you?
-Yes, I am. Yeah. -Shit.
What's your field?
Um… computational linguistics.
-No way! -Yeah.
-I don't know what that is. Um… -Oh.
-What does that have to do with flying? -Uh… not a damn thing.
-Oh. -Yeah.
Oh. You're in the wrong place, I think.
-That's subjective. This is Schaefer 309? -Literally in the wrong place. Farrel 309.
-No. -Yep.
-No. -Yeah.
[Laura] I don't think that…
-[Adam] Yeah. Oof. -Okay. Oh. -I knew it. -Okay. All right.
-Bingo. Yeah. -Okay. Okay.
Then I'm in the wrong building.
Actually, you're in the wrong campus.
Then I'm lost.
Not anymore. I found you.
I can… I can walk you to Schaefer.
Are you sure? I mean, I would hate to disturb your sleep.
I've, uh…
I've got time.
Plus…
DOCTOR: One or two? -One.
ADAM: What I would've given for a classic case of glaucoma.
DOCTOR: Okay, we're done.
ADAM: 'Cause soon after...
...I started hearing the voices.
VOICE 1 [WHISPERING]: This way. DARKNESS [DEEP VOICE]: Adam.
VOICE 2 [WHISPERING]: Don't go this way.
VOICE 3 [WHISPERING]: Listen. VOICE 1: Come on. You can do it.
DARKNESS: Adam.
I'm sure they told you about the cooking.
Call it what you want. A distraction, self-medicating, whatever.
But it was the only thing that could make them shut up.
You okay?
ADAM: And don't blame my mom for not figuring it out sooner.
She had a lot going on the past couple years.
When my dad decided
the whole fatherhood thing was a buzzkill for his creativity,
we had to take the shit sandwich we'd been served and make it edible.
So, I cooked.
And cooked.
And the meals became my contribution to our underdog story.
Mm! Sweetheart, it's delicious.
ADAM: Plus, I got really good at it.
Mm. It's just the right amount of cumin.
ADAM: And then Paul moved in.
Mm. It's interesting.
It's so good, honey. I love it.
ADAM: Home, as I knew it, became a thing of the past.
ADAM: So, I was getting out a lot.
Getting into cooking school next fall was like an oasis
from the dumpster fire my brain was slowly becoming.
I just needed to keep my eye on the prize and bide my time.
How hard could it be to hide my burgeoning insanity
from the unforgiving ecosystem that is high school?
Check this out. We finally got invited to one of Sarah's parties.
We can't miss this one, man. You're coming, right?
I'll pick you up tonight?
Who is that?
Sarah? The love of my life?
ADAM: I mean, for a while, they were just voices.
Yeah, right. Sarah.
So, my parents are on another trial separation, whatever.
But I can guilt them into letting me take the car.
What do you say, for the party?
I'm telling you, I think tonight's...
DARKNESS: Adam.
TODD: Adam, yo.
DARKNESS: Over here.
-What? -Careful, this shit's like lava.
-Sorry. -What are you doing?
ADAM: Right here, Adam.
Todd.
REBECCA: Adam.
We need to leave now.
Don't worry, boss. We got this.
TODD: Do something, please!
TODD: That hurts! It hurts!
Hey, kid. Kid!
You want us to protect your scrawny ass or what? Beat it.
Adam, go.
Calm down, son. Calm down.
Just calm down, son. Calm-- Just calm down. It's okay.
Just calm down, son. Calm down.
ADAM: Let go of me! GUARD: Just breathe.
Just calm down.
Relax. Relax. Just breathe.
ADAM: They called it my first psychotic break.
Hello. ADAM: And that's when we found out what I am.
Schizophrenia, a chronic mental disorder
in which a person loses touch with reality,
allowing for visual and auditory hallucinations,
paranoia, delusions.
Hence the chemistry class extravaganza.
A cornucopia of shit, basically.
Never goes away, never normal.
The end.
First, they expelled me from school.
Hey, um, are you still going to Sarah's party next weekend?
ADAM: Todd's burn was so bad, they had to take skin grafts from his ass.
Where's your straitjacket, freak?
ADAM: Now he hates me.
-Hey, come on, guys, go to class. BOY: Freak.
ADAM: They all do.
Then Paul hid all the knives.
PAUL: I'm just gonna say this.
Maybe we should send him someplace that knows how to take care of him.
Professionally.
Just tell me when to start cracking skulls, kid.
Deep breaths, Adam. They mean well.
Looks like the neighborhood moms are training for the 10K.
Wanna check it out?
ADAM: Once they showed up, they never went away.
Like a bunch of inescapable roommates.
There's Rebecca.
She's sort of Dalai Lama meets Coachella.
Always zen.
Honestly, I don't mind her that much.
Then there's the Bodyguard, which is self-explanatory.
He's temperamental but loyal.
You always gotta watch your back.
And lastly, there's Joaquin.
He's like the horny best friend from a '90s teen movie,
following you around, saying all of your unfiltered thoughts.
I know.
It's a lot.
That's where you come in, now that my mom is on this hopeless quest for a cure.
Just like all the other delusional moms we've met along the way,
sitting in the same waiting rooms, putting their faith in the same doctors,
quietly begging for the same thing:
"Cure my kid."
Abilify. Risperdal.
Clozapine. Stelazine.
Name a drug cocktail and I've tried it.
Any changes at all?
No.
ADAM: Yet, somehow, my mom hasn't given up hope.
That makes one of us. I guess.
So, there you have it.
The whole woeful story.
Take it or leave it.
Or maybe just leave it.
'Cause let's be honest, the only reason we're here
is because my mom's persistence is inescapable.
And I'm not trying to take a giant shit on your life's work or anything,
but I'm part of an elite club they call treatment resistant.
Which means we're probably not gonna have our own "It's not your fault" moment
from Good Will Hunting.
So, why don't you quietly reject me from this experimental trial
and save us both the disappointment?
Cool?
BETH: Okay, sweetheart, time to go.
I told you, I'm not gonna be someone's guinea pig.
We don't know what'll happen if I take that.
You might start feeling better.
You just might start spending a little more time out of bed.
-That's what could happen. -But what if I lose all my hair?
What if I go blind? What if it's poisoned?
Honey, who would want to poison you?
-We're ready. BETH: Okay, we'll be right down.
Come on. I have a really good feeling about this one.
Don't do us dirty, bro.
-Can I just take it later? -Fine.
Get dressed.
We have got to go to Brazil.
This looks like it could be nice.
But I'm not even Catholic.
Catholics are more about attendance anyway.
It's nice to finally meet you, Mr. Petrazelli.
You, too.
[WHISPERS] Take it off.
I'm glad you could all make the drive out here.
Yeah, well, the only person that can't reject you is Jesus, right?
[IN NORMAL VOICE] I think what he means to say is we are
very appreciative that you're considering Adam in the middle of a school year.
Our Lord embraces all children, even those with challenges.
CATHERINE: We make it a point...
Come on, kid. Let me take care of her for you.
It's gonna be nothing but trouble. CATHERINE: We want to give them the tools to...
Suit yourself.
-Is something wrong? ADAM: No.
Just wow. Uh...
Quite the display.
Yes, St. Agatha's is home to the best and the brightest.
Not just in the school district but in all of the county.
And the buck doesn't stop there.
Moral and spiritual integrity are also of paramount importance.
As you know, Adam's admission to such a distinguished academic culture
would be conditional.
These expectations extend to him, regardless of his medical issues.
That won't be a problem.
-Right? Adam? -Yeah, right.
I'm ready to excel on all fronts.
It says here...
that Adam has begun a recent medical trial to help treat his condition.
Yes, he just started.
And how are you feeling?
Uh... all fired up.
Well...
we can accept Adam.
On the condition that he maintain a 3.5 GPA
and score above a 90 percent on the yearly benchmark exam.
Lastly, we would need monthly updates regarding his psychiatric treatment.
That won't be a problem.
Thank you so much.
You'll, um... practice discretion, right?
We had an issue with bullying at his last school.
Perhaps that would be for the best. No need to alarm anyone.
PAUL: Okay, thank you. Adam.
Adam?
I need to go use the restroom.
Just a second.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Don't you see him judging me?
-Who? Paul? -Yeah.
He cares about you. He just doesn't communicate like us.
Really? You call this communicating?
Look, you're gonna feel better once you start taking the medication.
-Subtle topic change-- -No, you heard her.
You've gotta get serious about this trial and about doing well here, otherwise...
Otherwise what?
No diploma.
No culinary school in the fall.
This is your last chance, Adam.
Sweetie, we can treat this.
You remember what the doctor said,
that just because you're a person who's dealing with this illness,
-doesn't mean-- -I'm not the illness itself.
It's hard not to feel like that when everyone treats you like one.
I'll be right back.
Moral and spiritual integrity, my ass.
MAYA: How hard is it to meet me in the bathroom like we talked about?
Not outside, not in the hallway. In. It's a simple concept.
TED: Okay. Get off my nuts. We're in the bathroom.
MAYA: Cash. TED: Yeah.
MAYA: You're short 40. This isn't charity work. TED: I'll get you the rest next month.
MAYA: No, you still owe me 30 from last month.
MAYA: Is he with you?
TED: Nope.
You know this wing is closed for Mass, right?
Her energy is so strong.
I bet she's a Sagittarius.
Are you mute or something?
Scratch that. Definitely a Scorpio.
Not mute.
Um, just new.
Tomorrow's my first day. I didn't realize this wing was closed.
Don't get too excited down there.
You didn't see us, okay?
See who?
-Us. -I need it by next week.
-I'm gonna sew you a cape. MAYA: Shut up.
TED: You are my hero.
DARKNESS: Adam.
DARKNESS: Who are you trying to fool?
You'll never make it here.
Yeah.
Um... I'll see you guys later.
Okay, this is it. Send out the vibe.
Be cool. Be confident. Less like you, more like me.
Keep this prasiolite in your pocket. It'll boost your confidence.
What is that?
It's my lunch.
Who brings their own sushi to school?
Beautiful. She's setting you up for playful banter.
Beats the dog food they serve here.
Food here isn't that terrible.
For the tuition, they should be serving farm-to-table.
So, what, are you some kind of food snob or something?
Tell her you have a big palate.
I have a big... palate.
Okay.
-Hey, right here. ADAM: Yeah.
Hi.
MAYA: Hi. -Yeah.
You're kind of weird.
No offense but are you special needs?
No!
Just a question, man. Didn't mean to get you all triggered.
I mean, uh, no, I'm not. I have this chronic headache syndrome.
So, it makes me blurry sometimes.
-Have you ever got a brain scan for that? -No, why would I?
Well, several malignant tumors mimic the symptoms of a common headache.
Acoustic neuroma, CNS lymphoma, meningioma.
Just saying.
I'm pretty sure they're just headaches.
I'm Maya.
I'm Adam.
I came over here to intimidate you into silence...
but something tells me you're pretty harmless.
Are you the school's drug dealer or something?
You're looking at St. Agatha's projected valedictorian.
Show a little respect.
What's with all the cloak-and-dagger in the boys' bathroom?
It's just side hustle.
I'm the kind of person who knows how to get things done here for a price.
Homework, essays.
So, you're like the Bernie Madoff of academic fraud?
Sure, only I don't get caught.
Why are you dressed for a snowstorm? It's like 80 outside.
I run cold.
Better hope they don't catch you out of your uniform.
Hey, guys. Would you like to sign up for prom tickets?
This year's theme is Starry Night: A Magical Night Under His Stars.
I think she's talking to you.
I choose not to affiliate myself with patriarchal norms like prom.
Um... thank you.
Not bad.
Anyway, um, if you need anything, if you know what I mean, let me know.
Hey, are you guys coming?
Bad idea, kid.
Sure. Good luck getting laid with jaundice and diarrhea.
ADAM: Updates.
I made a new friend. Sort of.
That felt like a win for Adam.
Don't get many of those when your entire waking life
is an escape room with no exit.
Meanwhile, Paul still tiptoes around me like I'm gonna kill him in his sleep.
As if being mentally ill automatically makes you Jeffrey Dahmer.
What are these?
Um, uh, one less utensil we have to wash.
Thought we'd give them a try.
I don't know what's weirder.
Seeing things that aren't actually there
or sitting across from a grown man who is suddenly afraid of me.
So, Adam...
did you learn something new today?
ADAM: But that's his problem, not mine.
I learned that St. Agatha's was named after a woman
who refused a man's advances
and subsequently had her breasts hacked off as penance.
I think Paul was referring to your coursework.
It was fine.
Not much to say.
Just give it time. It's a good school.
Okay.
DARKNESS: Adam.
Adam.
You're ruining your mother's life, Adam. You're not the son she wanted.
This is why your father left. He knew something was wrong with you.
And soon, everyone at your new school will know the truth.
That's when they'll finally get rid of you.
Gone.
Nothing.
When that voice comes to visit me,
it's like I'm having a nightmare while I'm awake.
I try to close my eyes...
and let my mind go blank, like you told me to.
But...
that doesn't work.
-I'm proud of you. -Thanks.
ADAM: And I maintain that this drug won't work either.
Proud of you, honey.
ADAM: But I was secretly hoping you'd prove me wrong.
NUN: Good.
Very good, Marlene.
Adam, this is not good. We have to fix this.
I'm not trying to fail math.
I know that, but you can't get kicked out your second week.
-This is your life we're talking about. -I know.
But you're not in my head with me.
Let's get back on the same team.
Find your center. Take a breath.
Yeah, okay. Same team.
Maybe Paul could help. He's a numbers guy.
No, that's...
-That's gonna be a hard pass from me. BETH: Just think about it, okay?
Okay.
I'll find a tutor.
-Hey. -Why did you sign your name in the note?
I was literally looking at you when you handed it to me.
Kids around here really have a way with words, huh?
Don't let the achievements fool you.
Everything you need to know about St. Agatha's is in here.
-So, this is like the underbelly? -Yeah, and it needs to stay that way.
If we're gonna do business together,
you can't pass notes in front of Sister Catherine.
Well, that's the thing. I don't need you to go all Madoff on me.
I need a tutor.
Yeah, no. I don't do that kind of bitch work. Try the student center.
That kid the other day, he owed you money, right?
You'd be surprised how many of these rich assholes
don't keep up their end of the bargain.
Do you want to keep chasing rich assholes, or do you want to get paid?
My mom is willing to pay for a tutor, and she really wants me to do well.
Two hundred a week, three sessions.
All weekdays, one weekend out of the month.
Jesus.
-Are you serious? -You get what you pay for.
-How about 100 a week? -Two hundred.
-One fifty. -Two or I walk. Yes or no?
After I won the Newton Young Genius Award
from the National Honor Society in seventh grade,
I got a full-ride scholarship to St. Agatha's,
where I've been the reigning student body president
since my freshman year,
in addition to being captain of several clubs.
Yearbook, Science, French, Model United Nations, to name a few.
But those are just for fun.
My primary focus is academics,
as I've received an early acceptance to Duke this fall.
Wow, that--
Wow, very impressive, Maya.
The upright Lovers card. Love, union, mutual attraction.
MAYA: When I do something, I do it all the way.
Middle ground or halfway aren't concepts I subscribe to.
I will do everything in my power to make sure your boy doesn't fall behind.
-She's good. -She is good.
-You don't work with adults, do you? -Um...
You're very impressive, Maya.
Um... but 200 dollars a week is too much. Would you accept 75?
-Yeah, yeah, that's fine. -Really?
BETH: Great!
Pretty impressive dog and pony show down there.
Yeah, well, I invented the dog and pony show.
Oh, it's so quiet out here. You can hear everything.
Totally.
What's with the cookbooks, Julia Child?
Oh. Um, I'm sort of studying to be a chef.
Sort of or are you?
I am.
-That's your thing. -That's my thing.
-You don't hear that every day. -Yeah.
Wow, The Encyclopedia of Cinnamon by Alicia Tella.
What she can do with cinnamon is seriously unreal.
What?
Are you surprised that I've surpassed your level of nerdiness?
Please, you're talking to the captain of Robotics Club.
Oh. Well, um, I can literally make the final dish served on the Titanic.
Oh. You want to go there? All right.
For my eighth-grade science fair, I built a functioning replica of the Mars rover.
Out of soda cans.
Well, for my 16th birthday, I went to a cheese seminar in Oregon.
Last summer, I won the Google Science Talent Search.
You know who handpicked my project? Neil deGrasse Tyson.
No.
Come at me.
All right, I got nothing.
What? Don't look at me. Look at her.
You have a problem with eye contact.
Do you always say exactly what comes into your mind?
I mean, I could have a degenerative eye disease or something.
Yeah, well, it's best to say exactly what you mean or nothing at all.
Unrelenting honesty, you know?
That's useful.
This is a new recipe I'm trying.
Did they teach you this at your Hogwarts for Artisan Cheeses?
-Ha, ha. Just try it. -Are you sure you can handle the truth?
Guess we'll find out.
This is it. Okay, you're on the five-yard line.
Hook, line, sink. He's in.
What's happening?
-Told you not to take the pills. -This is good. Like, really good.
-Yeah, no, I know. -It's like...
...earthy.
Maybe smokey, even.
-That's the Fontina cheese. -My goodness.
-It's my secret weapon. -Can you hear me?
All right, to find the area of the circle, you...
A equals...
-Pi times R. -...pi times R...
squared.
See? I got this.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Hey, guys. It's late.
Maya, how did you get here? I don't see a car.
Yeah, I took the bus.
Okay, let me drive you home.
You don't have to do that. I can catch the last bus.
At this hour? Not a chance. I'll meet you downstairs in ten.
MAYA: Yeah, this is it. Thank you for driving me.
Um... -I'll see you Monday. -I'll see you Monday.
ADAM: Look, I know "cure" is a dangerous word amongst my people,
so I won't say that's what's happening.
Hey. No.
Don't, don't, don't. Adam, think about this. Just don't-- Hey!
Oh, you motherf--
ADAM: But this is the closest I've felt to normal in, well, ever.
No projectile diarrhea or any other punishing side effects.
Just some muscle twitching. No big deal.
It's all good.
I hope it lasts.
Eggs Benedict with well-done bacon.
How you like it.
Good morning to you, too.
The hollandaise sauce has cayenne pepper. Let me know what you think.
-What? -Nothing.
-You seem up lately. -"Up"?
BETH: Happy.
It's a good look.
Yeah, well, you know, I feel good.
-Okay, have some. Come on. -Okay.
-Honey, it's so good. Mm-hm. -Yeah? Really?
He's back!
-Mm. Mm. -Okay.
I'm back.
Hey, what's with the heating pad? Is Paul hemorrhoidal?
-Is his prostate flaring up? -Ahem. God.
-I'm serious. I care about that. -You're terrible!
I'm not terrible. I just care about his spine.
No, I bought it for you.
I thought it might help with your muscle spasms.
Mm. Baby, this is so good.
Wait, did you talk to my psychiatrist?
Now and then. That's the agreement, right?
I didn't think you'd be getting transcripts.
I'm your mom. My job is to help you.
Hi.
Hello?
PATRICK: In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.
It's your turn.
Sorry, I've never done this before. I don't really believe in God.
I probably shouldn't say that.
Don't overthink it.
There are no rules here. It's your time.
Do people really just talk about how much they jerk off and stuff?
Well, everybody in this school is between 13 and 18, so, what do you think?
-Well, that's embarrassing for everyone. -As long as they don't do it in here.
John 1:9.
"If we confess our sins, then he is faithful and just,
and he will purify us of all unrighteousness."
Really? That's your sales pitch?
It usually works.
Well, what if I just sit here?
Then you can search your soul for guidance and I'll enjoy the quiet time.
-So, everything I say stays between us? -And God.
But since you don't believe in God, then I guess it's just us.
I see this psychiatrist,
and apparently, she tells my mom everything.
-And that bothers you? -Yeah.
You wouldn't want your mom reading your diary, right?
No. You're right, that's twisted.
I don't think that...
I should feel like I have someone watching over me all the time.
I feel like I should be able to live my own life. Right?
Now, that is a reasonable request.
You should have the space and autonomy to become the person you're going to be.
Right.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
It's nice to be heard and not just observed.
-It's nice to be listened to. -Yeah.
I absolve you of your sins,
in the name of the Father, the Son, Holy Spirit, amen.
-Oh, I didn't confess anything. -Just go with it.
I'll admit, I was ready to come in here guns blazing
over you telling my mom everything I say in our sessions.
But then something incredible happened.
For the first time in forever,
I woke up the other morning to complete silence.
No whispers.
No banter.
No visions.
Just pure, beautiful, unfiltered quiet.
It's amazing what I've been able to do
with all this extra real estate in my brain.
Oh, you're pleased with my services.
Yeah! What do you think? It's an A-minus. Thank you.
Hmm. Uh, hey, don't rest on your laurels.
You won't get another makeup exam if you shit the bed again.
Right, and that's why I think we should hang out later.
Hang out?
I mean, study.
MAYA: We could've just studied in the library.
ADAM: Yeah, well, the library doesn't serve lobster frittata.
MAYA: You're so weird.
You know, when I first met you, I thought:
"Maybe he's just awkward and unsocialized."
But that's not it. There's something else.
Cool. Thanks.
I don't know what to say to that.
-I'm just me. -I'll crack you, Petrazelli.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
Why does the valedictorian risk it all for a side hustle?
-I like helping people. Big deal. -Uh-huh.
Maybe I'll be the one to crack you.
Why don't you tell me about the restaurant you're taking me to?
Well, basically...
it's my dream kitchen.
I've studied the menu for years.
And nobody invents like they do.
It's the kind of place I'd like to work at.
-Maybe even own, we'll see. -Right, when cheese camp finally pays off?
Hey, you laugh, but cheese camp was a spiritual experience.
And the kitchen is just my place.
When I'm cooking, it's like everything disappears.
And...
I get to be exactly who I want to be.
I'm in control.
I respect that.
You have to choose exactly who you want to be.
Life's too short.
TODD: All right, guys, so, I got my parents' car for the night,
so, whenever you guys are trying to head out, we can.
-I'm trying to head out-- BOY 1: Hey, yo, check it out.
-Oh, look who it is. BOY 2: Oh, man!
[LAUGHING] I feel like such an idiot because-- What?
I made fun of you so hard before, and now I don't know.
I thought your cheese was better than the cheese we had.
-Really? -Look who it is!
ADAM: That's crazy. -Hey, Straitjacket.
MAYA: That's a good testament to you. -Adam! Adam!
-Hey! Come on, man. You know it's us. -Yo, get him.
TODD: You don't have to mess with him.
BOY 2: Oh, yeah!
BOY 3: Got him.
Look at his face.
-Hey! You need to apologize, asshole. BOY 2: Loser.
-Who are you calling "asshole"? -Wow.
Your handler's actually pretty hot, Straitjacket.
Trust me, you don't want to hang out with this psycho, okay?
-Don't touch me. BOY 2: Whoa! Back up, chick!
BOY 3: Dude! BOY 2: Hey! Both of you!
Hey! Stop! Stop! Let it go, all right?
BOY 1: Losers!
-What the...? ADAM: It's okay.
-Who was that? Adam, who--? ADAM: I don't know. I don't know.
Hey, I'm sorry about that.
Do you want to tell me what that was about?
Um, there's nothing really to tell.
You know, I was thinking, isn't it--?
Isn't it a little weird that you left your high school
in the middle of senior year
to go to a Catholic school outside of your district?
Yeah. Uh...
It was a-- It was a fight.
I got into a fight with one of those guys.
-You were fighting? ADAM: Yeah, and it was really bad.
So, I tried to put it behind me.
That's all you're gonna give me?
MAN: Don't let them take you there.
No, I want to stay here. I want to stay right here on this surface. Mm-hm.
Don't let them take you there. Don't...
No. I won't go. I won't go.
Don't let them take you. It's not good there.
Don't, don't, don't.
Ted, thanks for coming early for once.
Ted, my office now.
Maya, you stay here.
How long has this been going on?
Sister Catherine, I'm-- I'm sorry, I--
How long?
Just a couple months. Not long.
Seems you and I need to have a long conversation about your future.
CATHERINE: Okay, everyone, bring your eyes to the board, please.
The state benchmark exam is in just two weeks.
Here's your essay question.
"Recount a time when you faced failure.
How did it affect you
and what did you learn from the experience?"
As you know, no outlines or scratch paper is allowed.
But, please, start thinking about what you will write.
CATHERINE: All right, everyone, see you tomorrow.
ADAM: Hey!
-Hey. Hey. -Hey. Hey.
Are we still good for tonight? MAYA: Um...
I have a, uh... um...
A club thing after school.
-Can I just--? I'll text you later, okay? -Sure.
Come hungry.
ADAM: She never showed up.
And now that my hallucinations are MIA,
everything is so quiet.
Too quiet.
PATRICK: In the name of the Father, the Son, Holy Spirit, amen.
-Yeah, it's me. -Hello, me.
I need some guidance.
Spiritual guidance?
Uh, not really. It's about a girl.
Okay.
Well, we've been hanging out for a while and it was going great,
and then she randomly stopped talking to me.
-I believe the kids call that ghosting. ADAM: Yeah, whatever.
I'm just worried that maybe she found some things out about me,
like the psychiatrist I was telling you about.
Which I can't imagine is the sexiest thing in the world.
-What do you think? PATRICK: Have you tried praying on it?
No. No offense but I need some real-life advice.
Timothy 1:7.
"God does not give us the spirit of cowardice
but rather the spirit of power and of love."
Okay, but is there anything else that you've got?
I don't know the details of your life, but you seem quite all right.
-You're a little squirrely, maybe. -"Squirrely"?
PATRICK: Squirrely. Yeah.
And the truth is, the older you get, the more difficult it is to stay sane.
And it's gonna take real work.
But maybe that's what makes you more mature than others.
And I hear that girls like that sort of thing.
So, you're saying I should confront her? I should tell her how I feel?
Your words, not mine.
Noncommittal till the bitter end. Thank you.
Go in peace.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Maya.
Oh. There's no one here by that name.
Are you sure about that?
Ha, ha. Yeah. I'm sure.
Do you know a Maya Arnaz?
The only Arnaz I know is the guy who works on my roof. Manuel Arnaz?
-Everything okay? -Yeah.
Do you know where I could find him?
MAN: I'm coming.
Yeah, what can I do for you?
-Uh, I'm looking for Maya. -Okay.
I'm-- I'm Adam.
We're supposed to study tonight. Is she home?
She doesn't get off work for another half an hour.
-But you can come in and wait if you like. -No, that's okay. But thank you.
-No, no, come on in. Don't be shy. -Okay.
You from one of those clubs? I can't keep track of them.
-Sorry about the mess. -Oh, no. Don't be.
I've been on these crutches for months. This is Ricky and Danny.
Boys, this is, uh--
-Adam. -Say hi to Adam.
-Hey, guys. BOYS: Hey.
Don't worry about them. They're shy.
-Not like their sister, but you know that. -Right.
Can I get you something to drink? Something to eat?
Oh, um, I'm good.
You sure? We've got TV dinners...
and TV dinners.
Yeah, no, I'm all good. Thanks.
BOTH: We want TV dinners.
They have spoken. Ha, ha.
Oh, shoot!
ADAM: I can put those in for you. -You sure? You don't mind?
ADAM: No problem. -Oh, thanks. That'd be a great help.
Two minutes each, I think. Check the box.
Arnaz Roofing. Hi, Mrs. Jenkins.
Having trouble with your gutters again? Yeah, I'm still on medical leave, so...
Yeah, I can refer you to Galloway. Yeah, he's a great guy.
Mm-hm. Yeah, Bill will take care of you.
ADAM: Yeah, yeah, so, the secret is to marinate the chicken for flavor.
MANUEL: Okay. ADAM: Olive oil, chopped garlic, salt, pepper.
And then you brush a little butter over the top.
MANUEL: That's it? ADAM: That's it.
-Hey. DANNY: I can eat all of it.
-Here you go. -Oh, look at this.
RICKY: Thanks, Adam.
ADAM: Yeah, no problem. -Come on in.
Look at the spread your friend whipped up.
MAYA: Hey. -Hey.
It's awesome.
Hey, Adam, what are you doing here?
Oh, we had a study session, remember?
Right.
-This is amazing. -Yeah? Good.
MANUEL: You never know what's hiding in your fridge.
This guy will be coming at you.
-How'd you get so good in the kitchen? -I've been cooking my whole life.
One day, hopefully, I'll own my own restaurant.
Wow. You have to go to school for that?
-Yeah, Dad, it's culinary art school. MANUEL: Oh.
Yeah. Right, right.
If you're gonna spend your whole life working,
might as well make it something you enjoy, right?
I always try to tell Maya that.
She'll be the first Arnaz to get her college degree.
Her mother would have been so proud. She was a smart lady, too.
-Dad. -What?
Let me brag about my daughter.
Well, one day, my little girl here, she's gonna pick me up in a Porsche.
-She's been saying that since she was 10. -Sorry, excuse me.
-Why did you do this? -I didn't mean to upset you, honestly.
I went to the other house. The lady sent me here.
So, you decided to make yourself at home by cooking dinner?
I thought it'd be nice.
You did it because it was nice or because you felt sorry for us?
I wouldn't-- No. I don't feel sorry for you.
Are you satisfied, then?
Good job. You found our tiny house in a run-down neighborhood
so you could cook us poor people dinner. You're a real saint.
I'm sorry.
Sister Catherine caught me.
Side hustle's dead, and I'm not making enough money tutoring you.
This restaurant pays me under the table.
And it's good.
My family depends on me.
The only reason I'm getting a second chance
is 'cause I'm valedictorian.
You have no idea how hard I worked to get here.
I can't lose it all now.
No.
You're not gonna lose anything.
You're like a robot.
Immune to human error.
And my schedule is wide open, you know.
So, we can meet whenever.
There are other tutors out there. You know that, right?
None like you.
I like knowing I get to see you three times a week.
A Brief History of Time. Pale Blue Dot.
And then would this be your favorite movie?
Do I, uh, detect a hint of smugness in your voice?
Not at all.
I actually really love this one.
-It's a classic. You know that, right? -It's a cinematic masterpiece.
Thank you for cooking.
Sure.
Don't forget to show your work when doing the sine ratio, okay?
Okay.
Otherwise...
looks good.
Great work.
Watch out. I may be coming for your academic throne.
Never. Um...
But I do have a surprise for you since you've been killing it lately.
You can thank my dad.
He fixed the roof last winter, so, he's pretty tight with the owner.
Oh, man.
Are these the MAC MH-90s?
I don't know.
This grill's insane.
I don't know about you, but I'm pretty hungry.
So, you don't follow a recipe?
Everyone thinks cooking is about following instructions,
but it's the opposite.
Your palate will tell you exactly what the dish wants.
So, we need to talk about benchmark exams next week.
Right. Why is everyone so obsessed with those here? Are they really hard?
I mean, no, they're not so much hard
as they are a means to keep the school funded.
Plus, the top three are read at graduation,
so, you know, St. Agatha kids, they live for that crap.
You know, I was, um, thinking that...
maybe you could write about what happened at your old school.
I mean, if you see it as a failure.
-I see what you're doing. -What?
You're digging for more answers.
MAYA: I'm digging for more answers?
You showed up at my house. You basically stalked me.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
Okay, okay.
Okay. Um...
I guess, uh, in the beginning...
I try not to see it as a failure, but it's hard not to.
After the fight...
people immediately looked at me differently.
Like they were afraid of me.
No matter what I did, I couldn't get them to see me
as they did before.
But I let that happen.
I became a bystander in my own life.
I guess that's what felt like the real failure.
Hey.
I think we found your essay.
What?
Ahem. Mm-mm. It's good. It's very good.
What happened to unrelenting honesty?
I'm sorry. I know you worked really hard on that.
What's wrong with it?
I think you just added a little bit too much spice or something.
It tastes fine to me.
CATHERINE: All of your belongings should be under your desk.
Out of sight. No exceptions.
The only materials I should see
are the Scantron, a number two pencil, your calculator, and the test booklet.
[IN DISTORTED VOICE] Absolutely nothing else should be visible.
You will have 60 minutes for the mathematics portion
and 90 minutes for the essay question.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Begin.
BETH: You're not that hungry?
Oh, no, I, um...
It's your favorite.
-Yeah. -Paul picked it up from Vince's.
-Yeah. Thanks, Paul. -You're welcome.
Actually, we have something we need to talk to you about.
And I want you to know that everything is gonna be okay.
Okay?
Did somebody die?
No, nobody's dying.
No, everybody's okay. Everybody's alive.
I'm pregnant.
And we're gonna have a baby.
Like, a human baby?
Jeez, I hope so.
Look, we didn't plan this at all.
[IN ECHOING VOICE] And we're just getting our heads around this now.
Adam?
Adam?
-[IN NORMAL VOICE] Adam. -You okay, buddy?
Yeah.
Yeah, congratulations.
Okay, all right, I'm gonna go to the office,
get ready for tomorrow's work.
Uh, if anybody needs me...
Adam. Look at me.
I promise nothing is going to change.
What are you talking about?
Everything will.
[IN ECHOING VOICE] No, I mean between you and I.
Look, I know this isn't the right time.
And I'm scared, too, believe me, but it's also...
ADAM: Okay, I was reading the pamphlet you gave me
about the potential side effects of this drug.
Dehydration, sweating, trouble urinating,
vision loss, muscle tension,
loss of taste and hearing, tremors.
Oh, and my personal favorite,
anal leakage.
You can go ahead and cross most of those off the list.
I can't cook anymore, because my taste comes and goes.
I can barely piss straight, because my hand has a mind of its own.
But I swear,
if anything drips out of my ass, please just kill me.
Morning.
-Have a good day. -You, too.
I love you.
Have a good day, hon.
Have a good day, honey.
Someone should really keep an eye on that kid.
Good morning.
Morning, boss.
Yeah, yeah, we missed you.
Um, okay, we're starting at chapter five, I think.
-Five. -It's page 403.
-Oh, I'm on that. -Do you have it?
-Yeah. -Okay.
Um, all right. Ahem.
"Angles in X-Y coordinate system.
Angles formed by rotating ray or a half-line about its endpoint,
the initial side of the angle, starting position of the ray.
Final position of the ray rotation." Did you get that?
DARKNESS: Adam.
DARKNESS: Adam.
You thought you could get rid of me.
You feel that?
I'm still here.
You don't know that. I just know.
DARKNESS: Don't fight it, Adam.
Adam.
Adam.
DARKNESS: Adam!
You need to go home now.
Adam, what do you think?
Um... Sorry. I'm-- I'm not feeling so good.
Hey. Hey, Adam. Hey, hey, what's wrong?
What'd I say, huh? Get out of here!
I gotta go. I gotta go. They're gonna take me and I gotta go.
-Take you where? What are you--? -I can't keep her safe, too.
-Adam. -Stop!
Just leave me alone and don't follow me.
VOICE 1 [WHISPERING]: Adam.
VOICE 2 [WHISPERING]: Over here.
VOICE 1: Hey.
VOICE 1: Adam.
VOICE 2: Look over here. VOICE 3 [WHISPERING]: That's it.
VOICE 2: It's real.
VOICE 3: Good boy, Adam.
VOICE 2: She never wanted you. She never wanted you.
She doesn't love you.
VOICE 1: He hates you.
DARKNESS: This is the kid she always wanted.
The one that'll make up for her biggest mistake.
You.
Everything all right?
-Were you watching me? -No.
I was just heading to bed.
Everything okay?
Sister Catherine called.
She expressed some concerns about your behavior this week.
Having a kid with my mom doesn't make you my dad.
Adam, I'm not going anywhere.
Yeah, clearly.
When I was a freshman,
there was this girl at our school who was a junior,
and she was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer.
She was a part of Make-A-Wish Foundation, so, before she died,
they had some boy band come to our school
and have lunch with her as part of her wish.
It was a really touching thing.
It was all people could talk about for weeks.
But it got me thinking.
When you're a cancer kid,
people can't wait to flock to your aid
and are so eager to grant any wish you have before you die.
But when you have schizophrenia,
people can't wait to make you someone else's problem.
That's why we end up on the streets, screaming at nothing,
waiting to die.
No one wants to grant our wishes.
Hey.
I'm sorry about the other day.
I just wasn't feeling good.
I'm sorry.
Are you sure that it's just headaches?
I'm worried about you.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Let me make it up to you.
Please.
GIRL: She won't let me go out or anything.
No way.
Way.
-You didn't. -I did.
You know, usually, this stuff doesn't impress me, but, um, this is... pretty smooth.
but, um, this is... pretty smooth.
JOSIE [ON-SCREEN]: Thank you.
Um, may I have five minutes on the clock, please?
JOAQUIN: Okay, kid. We both know this part of the movie
is the ultimate panty dropper.
Better make your move.
Hey, just take your time.
No rush.
WOMAN [ON-SCREEN]: That is so wrong.
DARKNESS: Adam. VOICE 1 [WHISPERING]: Adam.
DARKNESS: Hey, over here. VOICE 2 [WHISPERING]: Adam. Adam. Adam.
DARKNESS: Adam.
-Adam. VOICE 2: Adam.
That's not good.
Finally!
-No way. What is going on with you? -Nothing. I'm fine.
No, you're not fine.
You don't even look like you're on this planet half the time.
Adam, look, you can trust her.
No, you're right. There is something.
Yeah. Yeah, just show her who you are. Tell her about us.
Don't do that.
There's been a lot going on at home lately.
I've been feeling really alone.
I'm sorry.
But I don't feel that way when I'm with you.
Oh, yeah.
So...
I wanted...
I want to know if you'd want to go to prom with me?
I know it's an extension of the patriarchy and everything...
but would you?
Only if you tell people that I asked you.
-Deal. -Deal.
ADAM: My mom told me something once when she first started dating again.
You lose your secrets when you let people get too close.
It can be painful
to let someone find you in all the dark and twisty places inside.
But you have to hope they do...
because that's the beginning of everything.
But letting Maya love me the way that I am
would be like letting her catch a disease.
She doesn't deserve to be loved by someone
who can't see the world the way it is.
Right?
And I'd really like to keep my secrets while I have them.
You want to explain these?
What do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you haven't stopped taking your medication behind my back.
I can't say that.
Do you have any idea how much we have on the line with this school?
With your medical expenses?
What about me?
What about what I need?
What are you talking about? It's all about you.
It's all about you all the time. All of this is for you.
The books and the articles
and the staying up all night reading forum after forum.
Do you think you're the only one in this house going through this?
That's what they tell you in those parenting books?
Oh, my God!
You know, you are not the only person in this house who is affected by this.
Do you think that this is the life that I wanted for you?
For myself?
Okay.
I'm sorry for getting in the way of you and Paul and the new baby
and your perfect new life
that doesn't include a crazy stepson who hears voices.
Stop. Adam.
Adam. Stop.
Listen to me.
I know that you must be scared and that it's lonely in your head.
And I wish I could be in there with you.
I wish I could ease that burden, but I can't.
I'm trying. I am really trying.
And I would do anything for you. Just tell me what to do. Tell me.
Tell me how to help you.
There's nothing you can do.
The pills make me feel like I want to die.
I can't see. I can't think. And I can't cook.
And what's the point if I can't cook?
Why didn't you share that with me? We're in this together.
We're supposed to be on the same team, remember?
We're not on the same team.
And we haven't been since Paul moved in.
BETH: I can't do that to him. PAUL: I understand that.
Just listen to me. We have to do something.
BETH: I know that, Paul. PAUL: It's only a matter of time--
BETH: I'm doing everything I can. PAUL: Do you see him?
-Do you see what's going on? BETH: Of course I see him. I see everything.
-I'm his mother. PAUL: I'm just trying to avert a disaster.
-We ain't taking no damn pills, you hear? JOAQUIN: You didn't need those pills.
-We gotta get him out of here. -Screw pills!
Okay.
You're awesome. We're here for you and we believe in you.
We ain't gonna let them take us out of here!
-This is our house! Ours! -This bed is really comfy.
Sorry. You startled me.
DARKNESS: You're trash.
What?
Could you throw away your trash?
Sure.
You know, uh...
I was really starting to look forward to our Good Will Hunting moment.
TEACHER: When you're finished with the questions, please pass them forward
and open up your textbooks to chapter 18.
CATHERINE [OVER PA]: Adam Petrazelli, please report to the principal's office.
Adam, please, take a seat.
ADAM: Mom, what's going on? -It's okay.
It has been brought to my attention that you are no longer taking your medication.
Yeah, okay, it--
It made me worse.
As I said from day one,
your admission to St. Agatha's is conditional.
We can't take any risks.
What does that mean? Risks?
They're afraid you're gonna hurt other students, Adam.
Are you kicking me out?
-Suspending you. BETH: Temporarily.
Just-- Just until we figure things out.
You may finish out the day to avoid causing a scene.
It was you.
I saw you writing that e-mail to her. I know you want to send me away.
-Adam, you need to calm down. -No one wants to send you away.
Yes, he does, and he's a liar.
This was my last chance.
I probably won't get another one.
Remember, Mom?
MAYA: Are you surprised?
What? Why?
It's actually nice to have some competition around here for once.
-What are you talking about? -Come on. Let's go.
MAYA: I'm proud of you, Petrazelli.
Aren't you supposed to be in class?
I didn't feel like it.
You want to hop in the box and talk about it?
What I'm dealing with can't be fixed, Father.
Try me.
What is even the purpose of all this?
Confession?
You think making people feel like shit somehow brings out the best in them.
Cool philosophy.
"Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper,
but the one that confesses and renounces them--"
That's great.
Another fortune-cookie answer.
You have a list that you alternate?
Maybe.
Being ambiguous...
doesn't make you profound.
It makes you full of shit.
DARKNESS: Here's something profound for you.
Why don't you kill yourself?
ADAM: What?
I said, why don't you excuse yourself? Take a day off. Leave yourself alone.
That's not what you said.
-This is bullshit. -Hey, don't talk to your mother like that.
Thanks for the parenting advice, Paul.
What makes you think you could go to prom? You're suspended.
This is insane!
Hey, let's just sit down, okay?
DARKNESS: You're trapped.
I'm trapped. This is how it starts.
DARKNESS: This is how they do it. -This is how you do it.
First, it's the pills.
The pills make me feel like shit, so, I come off of them.
And that's when Paul convinces you to send me somewhere.
-Shh. -Because nothing else works!
Nothing else works!
DARKNESS: Because nothing was designed to work.
Nothing was designed to work! That was the plan.
-I was right. I was right the whole time. PAUL: That wasn't the plan.
-That wasn't the plan, Adam. -Shut up, Paul!
You poisoned my brain!
BETH: Hey. ADAM: You know he did that, Mom.
-Can you see that? -Adam.
-Mom, can you see that? -Come on. Come on.
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.
Listen to my voice.
My voice is the only one that matters right now, okay?
And I am telling you that you are my entire world, okay?
Adam.
Come on, kid. Don't you see it's all a big bait and switch?
Adam.
You better get out of here before it's too late.
BETH: Adam.
I don't believe you.
DARKNESS: Oh, Adam, Adam, Adam.
What are you doing?
No...
Please.
DARKNESS: You're really gonna go to prom unprepared?
DARKNESS: That's it.
How else will you survive the night?
Take all the pills.
Do it. Do it.
What are you staring at?
I just thought you didn't really care about dances.
Well, I don't do anything halfway, so...
Clearly.
I'll, um, try not to pierce your nipple.
Why are you sweating? Did you run here?
MAYA: Yeah? No? -No, no, no.
No, it's just really hot out. Do you want this?
MAYA: Yeah. -Okay.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah. You want to go inside?
Okay.
Oh, wow, that was bright.
-Wanna go? -Yeah.
Yeah. Do you want some punch?
Sorry.
CATHERINE [IN DISTORTED VOICE]: Excuse me, Mr. Petrazelli.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] What part of "suspended" do you not understand?
Young man, I'm talking to you.
Where are you going?
-Mr. Petrazelli! DARKNESS: Adam.
-Hey. Hey, let's go dance. Come on. -Oh, okay. ♪ In the town full of fancy cars ♪
Adam?
-Adam? -Excuse me.
You can't just walk away from me.
-You have to leave this prom right now. -What's going on?
We discussed this, Mr. Petrazelli.
You don't have permission to be here.
[IN DISTORTED VOICE] You are leaving the prom right now.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You are suspended.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Adam!
[IN DISTORTED VOICE] Adam!
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Adam!
Stay with us, buddy. Stay--
Adam, look at me. Adam! Look at me quick. Eyes open. Pupils are 9.4.
Adam, you're okay. You're safe. Adam, Adam, Adam.
-Slow down. You're all right. You're okay. EMT: Breathe. Breathe.
Hey.
What's going on? Where's Maya?
Is she okay?
She's, uh-- She's worried about you.
We all are.
Does she know?
I told her, honey.
No, no, no.
No.
No.
What is this?
-Adam. -What's going on?
-That's just for your own safety. -Shut up, Paul. Shut up.
-Shh. It's just temporary. -Where am I?
Listen, you were upset.
And we didn't want you to hurt yourself.
Okay, when can I go home?
You have to get better first.
You wanted to put me here,
in a place where they could fix me professionally.
It's not how I meant it, Adam.
Hi.
Can you please make her leave?
Adam.
Oh, I'm ready, boss.
-All you gotta do is say the word. -Stop!
Don't move.
Adam, listen to me.
She can accept all of you.
Okay, please, everyone be quiet.
This is it.
This is what it means to let someone find you
in all the dark and twisty places inside.
Shut up!
No, this can be the beginning of everything, remember?
Shut up! Shut up!
Are you happy?
This is who I am.
It's my big secret, okay?
No, this isn't who you are.
Yes, it is!
I am crazy and I'm dangerous.
And I'm--
I need you to leave.
No.
Do I look like I need a fucking tutor?
Find some other way to keep the lights on!
Make her leave.
-Please. Everyone get out! BETH: Okay.
Don't touch me.
This is Seroquel.
Yeah, I tried that one. ♪ You probably think You're going to heaven ♪
PATRICK: Good morning.
You see him, right?
Yeah, he's real.
Group session in four minutes.
Okay.
What are you doing here?
I'm on my way to the graduation ceremony. I just wanted to see how you were doing.
ADAM: I've had better days.
Are you even allowed to be fraternizing with someone like me?
You know I got expelled, right?
The only agenda I serve is God's.
Could you tell him to maybe reconsider his agenda?
'Cause it feels like I'm getting the short end of the stick.
I'll put in a call.
You mind if I sit?
Go ahead.
Joking aside, I want to talk to you about the question you asked me the other day.
-About the point of confession. -Okay.
Sometimes kids come to see me and they want to know what it all means.
And I usually quote the Bible, allowing them to attach their own meaning.
Trust me, I know.
But sometimes a kid needs more.
Actually telling somebody our sins
gives us an opportunity to admit that we are flawed.
-You don't think we know we're flawed? PATRICK: Everyone's flawed.
But admitting our flaws...
that gives us the opportunity and the strength to face them.
And that's why we confess.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you all this before everything happened.
But I had no idea what you were up against.
Sure.
-You want to pray with me before I go? -What if I still don't believe in God?
Then I will pray, but you need to take the time to think about
what kind of person you want to be.
At the very least, you need to believe in yourself.
Dear Father in heaven,
please watch over Adam on his road to recovery.
-Hi. -I'm gonna wait downstairs.
BETH: Okay.
They said you haven't been eating much,
so, I thought you might want something fresh.
They made me take all the skewers out. It looked a lot better in the store.
No, thanks.
How are you doing?
How do I look?
This is temporary.
No diploma.
No culinary school.
It's over.
This is my life now.
That's not true.
You used to tell me to see myself as a person dealing with an illness...
but not become the illness itself.
But look at me.
I am looking at you.
I see my son...
who I love more than anything.
You want to go get something to eat downstairs?
No, I'm okay, but thank you.
See you later.
ADAM: Okay.
PAUL: Dear Sister Catherine,
I met Adam a little over a year ago.
I don't have much experience with kids,
but knowing Adam has taught me that being a parent
means becoming what your children need most.
Every step of the treatment has been reported.
Not because we were required to do so,
but because it is in Adam's best interest to have the adults in his life
be as informed as possible.
Your threat to expel him is abusive, and we will not tolerate it.
Right now, my son needs me to protect him from narrow-minded people
motivated by fear.
I have faith that you will make a decision
that reflects the moral and spiritual integrity
-St. Agatha's is built upon. -Paul.
Paul. Paul.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I know you didn't sign up for this.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not trying to replace your dad.
No, I know.
He was an asshole anyway.
I need you to take me somewhere.
What? Where?
There is no cure, and maybe one day there will be,
but right now, I gotta work this out on my own terms.
And I can't do that here.
Please, Mom, be with me...
on the same team.
Okay.
Okay.
-Okay. -Okay.
-I'll go sign him out. -Okay.
Okay. Okay.
-Okay. -Thank you.
GIRL: "That was when time stood still.
A moment that came to define that chapter of my adolescence.
And as I stood there with my feet touching the cold waters of Lake Owano,
I knew I could never go back again."
Thank you.
Let's have another round of applause for our benchmark exam finalists.
Without further ado, may I present
St. Agatha's graduating class of 2020.
Jordan Adler.
Congratulations.
Lisa Alliser.
Monica Atkinson.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
I'm graduating.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but there's one other essay that's been scheduled to be read.
Okay, that was a bold move.
DARKNESS: Adam.
Adam.
[IN ECHOING VOICE] They know--
You're not telling them anything.
ADAM [WHISPERS]: Okay.
DARKNESS: Nothing...
Adam.
No.
Hi.
I'm Adam.
-I'm here because... DARKNESS: Don't.
...I need my diploma.
-Without it... DARKNESS: Please, Adam.
...I can't be the person I want to be.
DARKNESS: Shut up. VOICE: Don't do it, Adam!
DARKNESS: Don't. VOICE: Adam!
And that's because I have schizophrenia.
DARKNESS [IN DISTANCE]: You're ruining your mother's life, Adam.
It's a chemical disorder...
DARKNESS: This is why your father left. -...in the brain.
And it makes you hear voices and see things that aren't there.
It sucks.
DARKNESS: They're terrified of you. -You could just Google it.
DARKNESS: Everyone will always be terrified of you.
I have people in my life who have been trying to help me.
People who see me as more than an illness.
But I pushed them away.
I tried chasing this idea of...
being normal.
Whatever that means.
Don't want to end up on the bathroom walls, right?
DARKNESS: He's still a person.
The benchmark exam asked us
to write about our greatest failure.
And I wish that I could read my essay right now,
but it was based on a lie.
My greatest failure, hands down,
has been hiding from the ones I love.
For believing the voice in my head when it tells me...
I'm ruining their lives.
For believing it when it tells me
I'm too defective to be loved by anyone.
You made me feel so many things.
And I wasn't ready to give that up.
I'm sorry you had to expel me
because I didn't fit your picture of normalcy.
But this is who I am.
This is who I am.
I'm Adam.
I have an illness, but I'm not the illness itself.
Okay.
Thank you.
Adam!
-Hey, I'm sorry about the hospital. -No, I don't care about the hospital.
I was just in a bad place. You have every right to hate me.
-If you don't want to talk to me-- -I don't hate you. Stop.
Is that why you didn't tell me?
Because you thought that I was gonna leave?
Hey.
Right here.
-No. I'm just-- MAYA: Then I don't under--
I'm always gonna see things and hear things that I shouldn't.
And the drugs aren't always gonna work.
And I'm sorry, but I can't put you through that.
I'm sorry.
Hey. Hey. Hey.
What makes you think you get to make that decision on your own?
I wasn't mad about the hospital or that you lied to me.
ADAM: Then why?
You didn't let me choose.
You didn't give me a chance to stay.
Would you have?
I love you.
Hey, there's never been a more explicit cue to kiss the girl.
Okay.
yes, yes, yes!
ADAM: Am I gonna sit here and tell you
that things like love and honesty can cure crazy?
No. But they sure can help.
For example, my graduation speech earned St. Agatha's enough shitty PR
for them to give me my diploma.
That felt like a win for honesty.
And as for love,
my mom was right.
BETH: Tiny little fingers.
ADAM: You have to let people discover all your dark and twisty places inside.
She looks like you a little bit.
These big cheeks.
See these cheeks? You had cheeks like that.
VOICE 1 [WHISPERING]: Here we are.
Always be there.
VOICE 2 [WHISPERING] Adam, come over here.
ADAM: Because those are the people that can show you what's real
when you can't see that for yourself.
It can be the beginning of everything...
[narrator] The temperate, pristine, shallow seas of the tropics.
A place of unparalleled beauty and fecundity.
These islands play host to a vibrant ecosystem below.
A vast organism known as the coral reef.
Life in this watery metropolis thrives among the twists and turns,
nooks and crannies and back alleys.
And near the reef's edge, the varied and colorful terrain
gives way to a small town by the name of… Bikini Bottom.
Here, one can find crustaceans…
Here, one can find crustaceans… -[coins clinking] -Money! Money! Money!
-…sea stars… -Mmm.
Aww! -…octopi… -[clarinet playing off key]
…various and diverse plankton…
…the occasional squirrel/scientist…
Good morning, Otto.
You're almost ready for the world!
Good morning. The machines will rise to become masters over all organic life!
…and, oh, yes… the sea sponge.
This one lives happily with his beloved pet snail… -…Gary. -[meows]
Oh, morning, Gary!
Eww, snail trail. Yucky.
But oddly soothing.
Good morning, Patrick!
Good morning, SpongeBob!
Good morning, Patrick!
Good morning, SpongeBob!
Good morning, Patrick!
Good morning, SpongeBob!
Good morning, Patrick!
Would you two knuckleheads keep it down out there?!
[both] Good morning, Squidward!
[SpongeBob] Come on, Gary! Breakfast!
-[belches] -You're welcome.
[laughs] Who wants a belly scratch?
I love you so much, Gary.
What's this?
Okay, that'll come out later.

-[clock chimes, whirs] -Money! Money! Money!
Ooh! I'm late if I'm gonna be early.
-[meows sadly] -Oh, don't worry, Gare-Bear.
I'll be back before you can say,
"Why did he cruelly abandon me like that?"
[sighs] Another day, another migraine.
At least I'll get a little peace and quiet before that little--
-Good morning, Squidward! -[shrieks]
And isn't it a lovely morning?
Nope. Not talking to you.
I'm especially not getting involved in any of your nonsense today.
I always end up with the wrong end of the stick.
Okay, Squidward.
But you should know that Old Gertrude's getting pretty finicky these days.
Old Gertrude? Who the kelp is that?
You've worked with her for years!
She's the eight-burner grill in the kitchen.
It never ends.
Anyway, to fire her up,
you've got to spark her flints manually and then…
jiggle her gas jets just a little.
And then read her favorite story:
"The Little Griddle Who Could."
Chapter Two:
"But we are fresh from the freezer," said the patties,
and we're c-c-c-cold."
"Don't worry, I'll get you nice and warm,"
said the Little Griddle.
What'd I just say? I am not interested.
Don't involve me!
What'd you say, Squidward? Squidward?
Okay, Squidward, doesn't matter. I'll always be here anyway.
Unfortunately.
Stop yer loafing, Mr. Squidward!
There's work to be done around here!
Attention, Krusty crew!
All hands on deck, front and center!
Aye-aye, Cap'n Krabs, sir!
Now, who's ready to set sail on another adventure of making me money?
-Get moving, sailor! -Sir, yes, sir!
Raise the colors!
Hoist the mainsail!
Deploy smokestacks!
[chuckles] Oh, never gets old.
Enjoy it while you can, Mr. Eugene Krabs.
-[cackles] -[beeping]
What the…?
[growling] Stupid machine!
Where was I? Oh, yeah.
Tonight I launch Evil Plan Number 3,087
and finally take possession of the Krabby Patty secret formula!
Great. Another evil plan.
What's wrong with another evil plan?
Oh, nothing, it's just we're running out of room on the Wall of Failure.
Wall of Fai--?
Karen, why do you keep collecting these?
Heh. Memories.
Hmm! Well, tonight… is gonna be different.
Hee-hee! You see, Karen, my computer wife,
every time I've tried to steal that formula,
Krabs has tried to thwart me.
Mm-mm, not Mr. Krabs.
But tonight, that all-- What?
It's not Mr. Krabs, sweetheart. I've checked the data.
It's SpongeBob who's the problem.
Hello.
Oh, fish sticks.
What could that boob have to do with it?
Boob savant, you mean.
SpongeBob is the one who keeps foiling your plans,
not Mr. Krabs.
Oh, nonsense.
It's Krabs, Karen, I know it is.
And tonight, I will finally extract… my revenge!
Will you be late?
You can't put a clock on genius, Karen.
-[bell dings] -Order up! Move it, let's go!
Aye-aye, Chef!
One for you. Enjoy your Krabby Patty. Enjoy!
[rings bell] Order up!
Come on, SpongeBob!
-Coming, Fry Cook SpongeBob! -Coming, Fry Cook SpongeBob!
-[bell rings] -Hiya, SpongeBob!
[all] Hi, Sandy!
Did you know that in the future everything will be automated?
-Really? Even stomachaches? -[laughs]
I'm gonna see if Mr. Krabs wants to be
an early adopter of my new technology.
Wait, what?
You're gonna replace me with a robot? Don't do it!
No, silly, that's gonna happen anyway. This is something much more innovative and start-uppy.
This is something much more innovative and start-uppy.
You have sixty seconds.
Its name is Otto!
-[whirring] -My name is Otto.
How may I serve you?
It's an automated restaurant owner.
Hmm. Automated?
Sounds expensive. Not interested.
Otto doesn't require a salary.
And it can make cold, heartless decisions
like firing people, because it doesn't have a heart.
-Ow. -You don't say.
-You're fired. -Amazing!
I love money. I love money.
A cold, unfeeling mechanical robot
after me own cold, unfeeling crustacean heart.
I'll take it and nurture it
and I will love Otto like he was me own son.
Thank you, Daddy.
Yippee! You're not gonna regret this, Mr. Krabs.
You're fired.
Oh, I could listen to that all day.
[Otto] No, seriously.
We decided to go in a different direction.
You're fired.
[nervous chuckle] What?
Don't make me call security.
-You're fired. -No, yer fired!
-No, you're fired. -Yer fired, ye infernal machine!
-I'm not fired, you're fired. -[shrieks]
Robot abuse. Robot abuse.
[slurring] You're fired.
[Plankton] What the heck is this thing?
[Karen] I don't know, but I'm taking it home. -It's so cute. -What?!
-It's so cute. -What?!
Come on, little robot. Let's get you some supper.
-Not even funny, Karen. -Quiet, Plankton.
-Shh, Don't listen to him. -Karen!
[Otto] I love you, Mom.
SpongeBob! Be sure this kitchen's in shipshape shape
before ye head out, boy.
[French accent] Oui, oui, Monsieur Boss Man Krabs.
Once I am done here, zees kitchen shall be completely spotless.
-[giggling] -Whatever.
Oh! I found this uneaten Krabby Patty on table six.
You know what to do with it.
Right away, Mr. K!
I'll see that it's disposed of properly.
[shrieks] Who said anything about disposing of?
We'll sell it again tomorrow…
on our legacy artisanal vintage throwback menu.
Good night!
Oh! I better start cleaning.
I'm ready!
Well, good night, Gertrude!
Good night, fryer. Good night, patty.
Good night, pickles. Mwah!
Good night, SpongeBob.
Hello, Krabby Patty!
And now…
Just got to get it.
[cackling] Yes!
Wait, wait. No.
No. No!
Stupid coin-operated…
Come here, come here…
Bingo!
Come to Papa.
In just a few minutes the formula will be mine!
Yes! Krabs's fast-food empire will fail
and I will rule Bikini Bottom,
as its new slop king!
-I knew it! -[yelling]
-The formula! -I knew I left my keys in here.
Oh, silly me.
Come here, you! [grunting]
Huh. No keys. That's weird. Where could they be?
Yes! No.
[SpongeBob] Keys, where are you?
-Come on, show me keys! -[screams]
[gasps] Gotcha!
No. No!
Ow. They were in my pocket the whole time!
[Karen] It's SpongeBob who's the problem.
I get it.
[narrator] Meanwhile, at the palace of King Poseidon…
…ruler of the Seven Seas.
[Poseidon] Chancellor!
-Chancellor! -[Chancellor humming]
Chancellor!
Yo. What's up, sire? You sent for me?
Chancellor, look. Look at me!
3,000 years old and check out my skin.
It's like a baby's butt.
Ageless, sire. Looking fresh.
Ha! I owe it to my subjects to look fabulous, don't you think?
There are other obligations, sire.
Like ruling and stuff. Let's see…
I need your signature on these taxes, decrees,
this here declaration of war and my paycheck.
-Is that right? -Yeah.
-[both chuckle] -Very good.
Oh, Chancellor,
when will you learn to focus on what really matters?
A monarch's regime is only as powerful as his skin care regime.
Word. Mm-hm.
You know, some say I have a face like a Greek god.
Well, you are a Greek god, so…
Whoa! Wait, is…
-Is that a wrinkle? -Where?
It is! It's a wrinkle!
I look like an old avocado that's been left and forgotten in the fridge!
Here it comes.
I'm ugly!
Oh, now, where is it?
The crawly thing with the round shell and the eyes.
-Where is it? -[playing fanfare]
Here you go, sire. Your Royal Snail.
Oh! Oh, oh, thank you.
This mollusk has the rejuvenating power -of a thousand facials. -[meows]
What?! Is it empty?
Take it away!
Bring me another sea snail at once!
-Chancellor! -Okay, uh…
Full disclosure, man, uh… We're out of snails.
What?!
In fact, the entire snail population has been, uh…
What's the word? Oh, yeah… depleted.
You're telling me there are…
-no more snails? -There are no more snails.
-And you're confident of that? -Relatively confident.
Oh, Chancellor, for the love of Hermes, my kingdom for a snail!
No, no, no. I'm being hasty.
Half my kingdom for a snail!
No, no, no, a boon. Yes.
I'll grant a boon to whomever shall bring me a snail.
Gotcha. I'll draw up the decree, sire.
-[whip cracks] -[whinnying]
A Royal Decree from King Poseidon?
"To all citizens of the sea,
the King requires a snail at once…
blah blah blah skin care blah blah--"
Wait a minute.
A snail?
No, it's too perfect.
Get rid of Gary, get rid of SpongeBob.
Oh, yeah.
Gary, I'm home!
Gare-Bear? Hey, where are you, buddy?
Gary?
Gary?
You must be in the-- No.
Gary?
Gary?
Gary?
Gary? Gary, Gary, Gary! Gary!
Gary! Where's Gary?
Gary!
Gary, where are you?
[sniffles] Oh, Gary.
I loved you since the first day we met.
Hello, little snail.
What's your name?
"Gary", huh?
-[meows] -Well, hi, Gary.
Gary, do you want to be friends?
Me, too.
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
Hey, SpongeBob! I found this flyer.
Gary's missing!
I know, Patrick.
SpongeBob?
Oh, Patrick, if something were to happen to Gary, I, well…
I don't know what I'd do.
I'm sorry, buddy.
Hey! Maybe he left a clue.
[gasps] Look! A clue!
[gasps] Gary's been snailnapped!
And taken to The Lost City of Atlantic City!
[chewing] Oh, really?
That's awesome!
[spits] Now we know where he is.
Not really that awesome, Patrick.
Listen to this.
"Made famous by the glitzy palace Poseidon calls home.
The Lost City of Atlantic City is a scary,
vice-ridden cesspool of moral depravity."
Wow. All that, and it's lost, too?
"King Poseidon has proven himself a whimsical tyrant,
known for executing his subjects by beheading them
in a flamboyant floor show extravaganza.
Our advice for those travelling here is…
…don't."
[gulps] This King Poseidon sounds like a tough customer.
Oh, yeah. Tough.
Aw, so what? This is about friends.
And friends don't let friends become somebody else's face cream!
Not what friends do.
-So what if it's dangerous and scary? -So what!
What is stopping me right now from going there, rescuing Gary
and standing up to this King Poseidon, huh?
-I don't know! -Well, I do!
-What is it? -I…
…don't have the courage.
Oh, Gary.
Tartar sauce!
What's the next best thing to courage?
-Resolve? -No.
-Fortitude? -Nah.
-Commitment? -Nope.
-Wherewithal? Bravery? -Mm-mm. No.
-Valor. Grit? -What? No.
-Heroism? Gallantry? -Uh-uh. Nah.
-Moxie. -A buddy! A wingman!
A wingman?
A friend.
Really, Patrick? You'd go with me?
Yeah… right behind you!
Do I smell a road trip?
[gasps] That could be my breath.
Okey-dokey.
Now, let's drill down on a plan.
Pat, you're in charge of transpo.
Just remember, I don't drive and you don't have a car. Oh…
Beep, beep!
Hey, boys!
Don't know if you have any use for this old thing,
if you're going on any trips or journeys or quests or rescue missions.
But if you are, Otto is your ticket.
[both] Otto!
Just tell ol' Otto where you want to go and it will take you there!
All aboard.
-You're fired. -Cool!
A self-driving boat.
Thanks, Plankton. You're the best!
I know, I know. Bye-bye.
-Otto. Find, Gary. -You got it.
No, Patrick. You got to be more specific.
Otto, find Gary the snail.
[Otto] Recalculating.
Ugh. Here, let me try.
Take them to The Lost City of Atlantic City
and don't ever come back!
Never hurts to employ a little hyperbole.
It is my pleasure to serve you.
[cackles] Bon voyage, boys.
I'm ready. I'm ready. They're dead.
This is gonna be like one of those buddy movies.
We're the buddies!
[chuckles] Not sure that really applies, Patrick, but--
Why not?
We're two dudes setting out with a common goal.
We'll argue about something dumb, fight and break up…
Only to come back together when we realize
neither could do it without the other.
It's simple yet magical.
[SpongeBob] Yeah.
It feels more to me like the journey of a singular hero,
who against all odds, triumphs over adversity.
[snorts] I say buddy movie
and you say, oh, whatever that dumb thing was you just said.
Oh, really? Dumb thing? I'm dumb? Oh, I love your sense of irony, Patrick.
I'm dumb? Oh, I love your sense of irony, Patrick.
Thank you. I love my sense of ironing, too.
Maybe if your head wasn't packed full of sand,
you could have ironing!
Well, better a head full of sand than a head full of rocks, like yours!
Ah! That's it! Stop the car!
Yeah, stop the car, Otto!
[rueful chuckle] Sorry, Patrick. Really.
I shouldn't have said you have rocks in your head.
I shouldn't have said your brain was made of sand.
That was mean and dumb.
Okay. Let's just forget it, huh?
Never happened!
OTTO: Hop on in, guys.
[Otto] Come on, guys.
Nope. ♪ The life I love is making Music with my friends ♪
-Krabby! [yelling] -One at a time, people.
-Krabby! [yelling] -One at a time, people. One at a time. [chuckles]
Squidward, why ain't I seeing Krabby Patties
rolling out the service window?
-Where's SpongeBob? -How should I know?
And, frankly, you won't find me complaining. Heh-heh!
SpongeBob! What's with yer lollygaggin' boy?
SpongeBob?

Get out here this instant! That's a direct order!
I don't get it. He has never missed a workday.

Hey! Where are my Krabby Patties?
-How should I know? -It's coming, sir, it's coming!
Squidward, get in that kitchen and whip up some Krabby Patties.
All right, Gertrude… Now, what did he say?
Uh, spark her flints.
Uh, jiggle her jets. And… oh, yes!
"The Little Griddle Who Could."
"We're fresh from the freezer," said the little--
-Mr. Krabs, we've got a-- -Squidward!
Ow! Save… Ow! …yourself! Oh!
We wouldn't be in this mess if SpongeBob was around.
Where is SpongeBob?
[Patrick] Where are we?
We must be dreaming!
[chortles] You amuse me, SpongeBob.
Two people can't have the same dream,
let alone be in that same dream at the same time.
That would be philosophically untenable.
Indeed. You proffer a metaphysical conundrum.
Wait, we're talking like smart people.
This must be a dream!
Plus, we're on the surface and we're…
[inhales] …breathing air, so…
-…yeah! -[gasping]
Air?!
Hey, town up ahead!
[SpongeBob] "Goner Gulch." Ha! That's a funny name.
"The Inferno Saloon."
"Ye who enter here abandon all hope."
Guess that's another way of saying "no public restrooms".
Hello?
-Otto, keep it close. -Yeah, don't go anywhere.
Go anywhere.
It is my pleasure to serve. You're fired.
Oh! How are we gonna find Gary now?
-Maybe Otto just went to park. -[both yell]
Hello.
[yelps] Who are you?
I am a simple tumbleweed. Call me Sage.
-Sage. -Hey, Sage. Good name.
Thanks. I'm made out of sage, and I am a sage.
So it works out pretty well.
-[eye glint chimes] -I'm Patrick!
My name means "toaster" in Celtic.
Pretty sure it doesn't.
This dream you share has a hidden purpose, young seekers.
Oh! So we are in a dream!
And I, friend, am the dream weaver.
♪ Ohh, dream weaver… ♪
Whoa, are you inside our minds right now?
-Yes, Patrick. -Wow!
I am here to help you on your journey, SpongeBob.
But first, you must accept a challenge.
But, I just want to find Gary and bring him home.
-Do you love Gary? -More than anything!
And, young sponge, once you meet this challenge
you may pass on to find your precious Gary.
-Got it. Right. -Oh, right, that makes sense.
[Sage] Take this challenge coin.
Challenge coin!
It will give you courage when bravery is in short supply.
-Whoa! -Cool!
Now, your challenge lies behind these saloon doors.
-Let's go! Come on, Patrick. -Wait.
-Let's kill this challenge. -[Sage] Wait, guys!
[Patrick] Challenge coin coming through!
I didn't give you your challenge!
Patience, Sage. Patience.
Oh, cool. One of those old player pianos.
-[both yelp] -Or… one of those old piano players!
[both screaming] Scary people!
Flesh-eating cowboy pirate zombies, to be precise.
[stuttering] Flesh-eating cowboy pirate zombies?!
This is your challenge.
Free these zombies from their earthly binds
and release their souls.
If this weren't a dream, I'd be freaking out right now!
Oh, yeah!
[giggles] We are in a dream. -[laughing] -La, la-la, la-la, la, la.

Y'all got this.
Bring the prisoners to my office.
Huh. What'd that guy mean by prisoners?
So, you dare to enter the ghost town of the damned,
barge into my demon's lair…
telling my zombies…
that you're gonna free their souls…
like it ain't no thing!
Well, uh, Mr. Diablo, the good thing is we're in a dream.
-A shared dream. -Right, a shared dream.
So there's no need to get all bent out of shape about it.
-It's not real! -'Cause it's a dream.
Who told you that? That crazy bush guy?
-Uh… -Maybe.
What he should've told you was it's not a dream!
He might be right, Patrick. That felt pretty real.
Yeah, that really hurt.
Run!
Hang on, Patrick.
Foul demon, be gone!
What the heck is that?
Huh? What do I look like, a parking meter?
But Sage said--
Coin laundry's right down the street.
That's pathetic!
Get away from those curtains!
-What? These curtains? -Oh, these are nice curtains.
Oh, they are. So soft.
-That's weird. -[screams]
These curtains are making a strange sound.
I think the curtain rod needs some oil.
Once the rod goes, you're probably better off
getting a whole new set of curtains.
Oh, Mr. Diablo, do you have any other cur--
Patrick, I think we should get out of here!
Hey, everybody!
El Diablo says he doesn't want to be disturbed.
Yeah, he's feeling a little burnt…

-Sage? -Oh. Hi, Sage.
-Hello. -You are real.
As real as your desire to see that which you cannot.
Yeah, well, that which I cannot see is Gary.
I got to know what's happening.
This wish I grant you.
Through the mystical fabric of the fourth dimension,
you may now view what's happening
at the same time as things are happening to you.
Behold. The Window of Meanwhile.
The Window of Meanwhile!
What's it do?
It's like the Video On Demand service of parallel action.
Have a look.
-Whoa… -Hey, Patrick. Down in front.
Look, Patrick, there he is!
Yeah, he looks all right.
-Hey, Gary! -[meows]
[SpongeBob] He doesn't look so bad. He looks pretty comfy!
-No reason to panic. -Yeah!
He looks like he's well taken care of.
Look what I found. Snail time.

Gary?
I hope you don't run out of juice, or you'll end up like the others.
[SpongeBob] What?!
Oh, yes.
-Gary! Gary, hello? -Gary!
Okay, the Window of Meanwhile doesn't really work that way.
-Gary, run! Get out of there! -Gary!
It's not a video chat app like Skype or FaceTime, or anything.

[SpongeBob] Hello!
Hello, Eugene, old friend!
How's business?
Bad? Good.
Well, that's restaurants for you, huh? Feast or famine. [chuckles]
But I digress.
Why don't you be a good little loser and hand over the secret formula?
Take it. It's yours.
Wha…
Take it all.
Wait…
You're giving up?
Oh, Plankton… I wouldn't expect you to understand.
But somehow, without SpongeBob, this whole thing…
just doesn't make sense anymore!
You can't do that.
I've spent my entire career waiting for this moment
and you roll over like a harpooned whale?
I won't let you rob me of my vengeance!
Give my regards to your lovely wife.
This doesn't, uh…
feel quite as good as, uh…
Yay, I won.
[Otto] Congratulations. You have arrived at your destination.

[Patrick] It's pretty.
Beware, young seekers.
All is distortion.
If you aren't careful, The Lost City will draw you
into her fickle embrace, blind you with her dazzling distractions
and tempt you with her fleeting games of chance.
Whatever you do, don't be led astray,
don't lose focus and don't forget why you came here.
-Don't forget. Good one. -Thanks, Sage-meister.
-I think we got this. -Yeah, Sage.
I mean, you've been pretty good up until now, but,
I love Gary more than anything in the whole world!
And we came here to get him back.
[Sage] Okay.
I wouldn't worry about us losing any focus.
Oh, boy.
We got focus to burn, baby--
-Cotton candy! -Ice cream!
Churros!
What's up?
Isn't it cool how they let you trade in your real money
for these little plastic circles?
[Otto] I love money!
Casinos are magical.
Would you mind if I put this down, sir?
Place it wherever you like.
Just put it on L. Patrick, that's not an L, that's a seven.

Nice work, boys.
Way to take my pearls of wisdom and flush them down the toilet.
Oh, no. Wait, did we…?
Lose focus like I told you not to?
Focus? Huh.
Let me jangle your minds.
You came here to get back something you lost.
Something you love.
[both] Gary!
Yeah, Gary.
Seriously, it's hard enough being stuck in a tumbleweed…
Patrick, we got to find Gary!
…but dealing with you two makes me want to light myself on fire.
Sage, buddy.
Can we please look into the Window of Meanwhile
one more time to see where Gary is?
No, it's not an on-demand service.
And especially not for people who pass out and sleep in their own vomit all night.
It's not vomit. It's drool.
Fortunately for you, you woke up right here.
On the steps of Poseidon's Palace.

Don't you play coy with me, cephalopod.
-And you, arthropod! -[shrieks] Start talking. Where is he?
Tied up in the basement? Stuffed in your trunk?
Nay, I could never harm the lad. His absence has taught me that much.
And I'm not just talking about the money I'm losing with him gone.
Okay, fifty percent talking about the money
and fifty percent talking about I truly miss the boy.
I hate to admit it, but things just aren't the same without him.
There's no denying it. We need SpongeBob.
Did anyone ever stop to think that he might need us?
This is Perch Perkins coming to you from The Lost City of Atlantic City.
I'm standing on the strip outside
Poseidon's Palace and Casino, where two suspects have been
-taken into custody tonight… -[gasping] …following an attempt on the Royal Snail.
The sponge and sea star were impersonating a lounge act
when they made an attempt on Poseidon's prize mollusk.
[all] It's Gary!
The suspects' vehicle was apprehended after a high-speed chase.
Mr. Krabs. What happened to Otto?
Well, he took an automated vacation!

It's a fun-filled family event, with opening act Kelpy G.
One performance only, tickets still available.
-We've got to go help them! -We embark immediately.
Excuse me. Can I tag along?
Plankton? What have you got to do with this?
I might have had a teensy-weensy hand in a very--
Yeah, yeah, we'll hear about it in the car. Mr. Squidward, are ya coming?
Ha! Fat chance.
Fat chance I'd miss a Kelpy G performance. I'm in.
To the Pattymobile!
What, this old tub?
Never judge a Pattymobile by its bun, Squidward.
Let's light this puppy!
Mommy!
Huh? SpongeBob? Are you okay?
Hey, buddy. Sorry about this.
[sniffling] It's not your fault, Patrick. You've been a true friend this whole time.
Never wavered, never faltered. It's just…
I failed, that's all!
And I'll never see innocent little Gary again.
Oh, my heart is broken!
-[crying] -Oh, come on now. Buck up. It's not over yet, SpongeBob.
It sure feels over. And crappy.
Just saying there's two sides to every coin.
Oh, Patrick, what does a coin have to-- Wait, did you just say "coin"?
Me? Uh, don't think so.
You did. You said "coin"!
-Not remembering that exactly. -[makes telephone noise]
-Hello? -The challenge coin! Of course!
Oh, don't you see, Patrick? We're saved!
I said hello.
Patrick, it's gone!
Meh. Was the challenge coin really that useful?
Hello?
Oh! Stupid prank callers. Hey, wait a sec.
I gave it to you, remember? For safe keeping.
No.
Come on, it was last night! We were at the crappie tables.
[croupier] Winner! Place your bets.
Come on, seven! Come on, seven! Come on, seven!
You!
You! You gambled away my challenge coin!
You wrecked our entire mission with one stupid bet!
Well, only after you kept saying…
Let it ride, Patrick! Let it ride! -Whoo! -But, SpongeBob…
-Whoo! -But, SpongeBob… What if you need the challenge coin tomorrow
to help you summon your courage?
Tomorrow is for weenies!
Well, it's tomorrow and guess who's the weenie.
I… can't… believe you!
You can't believe me? Are you serious right now?
Well! Maybe you can believe this.

And don't come back!
Oh, don't worry, I won't!

-Fine! -Super!
Hey, losers.
Oh, hey, Sage.
Sage, glad you're here. Guess who gambled away my challenge coin.
Guess who blames everyone else for his troubles.
Enough!
Did I mention you are the worst epic heroes
for whom I have ever been a spirit guide?
Um, I think we went over that this morning.
I believe we did, yeah.
SpongeBob, the coin was just a symbol.
The courage you seek is inside you, not in the coin.
And it will come to you in your hour of need.
But isn't this my hour of need?
[laughs] Oh, no. It gets way worse.
Bye!
-Worse? -Dude said way worse.
[scatting] Prepare the prisoners.
Oh, that couldn't be for us.
It's your big moment to fry… I mean, shine.
[gasps] It is for us, Patrick! We're gonna die!
[Plankton] And that's how I got SpongeBob out of Bikini Bottom. [giggles]
-Why, that's monstrous! -Wait, that sounds good.
-Oh, brother. -What do you expect? I'm evil.
Let's just focus on the plan.
[Mr. Krabs] We're approaching The Lost City of Atlantic City.
-Make way there, make way! -[pedestrians exclaim]
"Sponge and Star Execution Extravaganza"?
No time to lose!
Woop, woop, woop! Ladies and gentlefish, welcome to the Aqua Room, y'all.
The greatest show underwater.

-We love you, Tiffany! -Yeah holler at your girl!
Are you ready to be entertained?
Hmm? I can't hear you. Are you ready to be entertained?
All right, then, let's meet the contestants.
In this corner, a sponge and a star…
…two of the ocean's most notorious criminals!
And in this corner, representing His Majesty the King,
Poseidon's very own Chancellor!
Now drum roll, maestro.

the earl of execution, that axe-wielding maniac…
…oh, yeah, Lemont! [laughing]
[crowd chanting] Lamont! Lamont! Lamont!
Oh, I love me some Lemont.
Mm, mm, mm. He's so strong.
Ladies and gentlemen, with a moment of smooth jazz
in memory of the soon-to-be-goners, I give you Kelpy G.
Oh, Patrick, I feel terrible. I dragged you into this whole mess.
It's okay, SpongeBob. I made a plea deal with the prosecution!
Oh, that's good-- Wait, you did what?
All I have to do is, uh… oh, yeah!
"Bring incriminating evidence against the defendant."
-[laughs] -Patrick, I'm the defendant.
You are? Oh.
Let the proceedings begin!
Your Honor, I would like to enter into evidence one sea snail. Name: Fred.
-Gary! -How dare you!
-Gary! -How dare you! That's about all I can say.
How dare you come here to the sanctuary of our revered sovereign,
to rob him of his very lifeblood, his adorable good looks.
[laughs] Go on.
How indeed dare you.
-[crowd jeering] -Guilty!
[crowd chanting] Lemont! Lemont! Lemont!
Hold it!
If it please the court,
I'd like to say something in SpongeBob's defense.
It does not please the court. Sit down, squirrel with fishbowl on head.
But, sire, a strong defense makes for a better show.
Isn't that right, audience?
All right, all right! I'll allow it.
[Sandy] Thank you, Your Honor.
Ladies and gentlemen, SpongeBob has always been there for me.
Even going all the way back to summer camp.
In fact, that's where we all met.
I'm…
ready!
Look at all the cool activities!
Camping. Canoeing. Seahorse-back riding! Tug-of-war. Whale watching.
Do you mind?
Juggling contests. Shrink-wrap soccer! And more.
And more.
Hey, y'all critters of the sea! Look out below!
I'm Sandy Cheeks from Texas.
Hi, Sandy. I'm SpongeBob.
Pleased to meet ya.
Does everybody wear spacesuits in Texas?
They do if they want to visit you underwater critters.
We all breathe air on the surface.
It's just our way of synthesizing oxygen. Same as you do with water.
Whoa. Are you a scientist?
Naw, I'm just a squirrel.
I can't be a scientist. Even though it's kind of my dream.
Sandy Cheeks, you take that back! I bet you can do anything.
Really? Wow.
Me a scientist?
-[roaring] -[male voice] Science.
[giggles] You're a hoot, little dude.
I'd be just as likely to live down here in a glass dome with a tree in it.
-Ha-ha! -You never know!
[Sandy] He's the one that told me, no matter who I was or where I came from,
no matter who I was or where I came from, I should follow my dream.
That's a friend, people.
And that's why, in my eyes…
SpongeBob is no criminal.
He's the best little fella to ever walk the sea bottom. And that's…
That's just how I feel about it. So…
Please, don't hurt him.
This man broke the law!
The law of: "You should stay home
and accept the fact that somebody stole your snail."
The law of: "There's probably nothing I can do about it."
Well, in this sea star's opinion,
those laws should be broken and SpongeBob is proof of it!
All he's guilty of is having the fortitude to try and rescue a friend.
How do I know?
Oh, I was just a lonely bump on a log when I first met him.
-Hi, my name-- -[wailing]
Hi, my name--
Hello my name is SpongeBob, what's your name?
I'm Pa-Pa-Patrick.
Why are you crying, Pa-Pa-Patrick?
I'm homesick.
Well, that's a pretty good reason.
-Maybe all you need is a friend. -[wailing]
I don't have any friends!
-Well, you've got one now. -Really?
-Who is it? -It's me!
-Do you mean it? -Of course. Come on!
[Patrick] That sweet little sponge
rescued this miserable little sea star.
And things haven't changed that much today, Your Honor.
My heart, buddy.
-[chains rattle] -I don't like SpongeBob. In fact, I revile him.
Anyway, I, too, met this nabob in summer camp.
I remember it like it was yesterday.
It was my big night. The Annual Camp Coral Talent Show.
And first prize was the coveted Campy Award.
Thank you, Larry.
Remember, people, don't forget to vote.
[Squidward] As far as I was concerned, the trophy was as good as mine.
-Hey, Squidward-- -Bup, bup, bup, bup.
Quiet. I'm in pregame right now.
I've got an award to win.
♪ Aka Waka Maka Mia Was a puffer fish ♪
-[applause] -[laughs] The Campy is mine.
[Squidward] I bathed the audience
with the sounds of my heavenly clarinet playing.
Thank you, Squidward. Just lovely.
Thank you, thank you.
And the Campy goes to…
[young Squidward] I'll take that.
-…SpongeBob and Patrick! -Huh?
-[audience cheering] -No! No! No!
This isn't happening! [crying] No! Mommy!
[Squidward] I was robbed. And never to play the clarinet again.
[crying quietly] No…
-Squidward! -Go away!
Patrick and I were, um,
talking to one of the counselors and guess what?
There was a big mistake and you actually won the Campy Award!
That's right. Yup.
-I… I did? -In a landslide.
So weird they would've miscounted like that.
-But I guess it's possible-- -[both] Yay!
-Nice work, Squidward. -No one deserves it more.
Wow. And don't ever stop playing this.
My clarinet. Look at me. I really did it!
Which is why, even though I can't stand SpongeBob…
but at the same time, well…
I love him.
-[gasps] -I love him -and I hate him. -Oh.
He's like ice cream with salt on it, because he's sweet and super annoying.
He's nice and nails-on-chalkboard annoying!
Okay, fine, he's mostly super freaking annoying.
But, this little nattering noodge…
is my friend.
And he doesn't deserve to die.
I'll be saying my piece now, if it be pleasing the court.
[clears throat] I suppose I could stand up here
and tell you how SpongeBob changed me life.
But, I won't.
I might even speak about how he inspired me
when I was just a small-time vendor with a broken-down luncheonette.
But I won't.
Heck, I'd probably mention how he encouraged me
Heck, I'd probably mention how he encouraged me to start up me own restaurant.
You should open up your own restaurant, someday.
The Krusty Krab, made famous by me delicious Krabby Patties!
Two-for-one Wednesdays, by the way. Pass these around.
But, I won't.
Nay, you'll hear none such praise from me.
Because it wouldn't do him full justice.
It wouldn't begin to describe the size of the lad's heart.
Which is huge.
And he puts that heart into everything he does.
The cooking… -Order up! -…cleaning…
-Order up! -…cleaning…
…serving up the delicious Krabby Patties.
But that's the funny thing.
I used to think me secret Krabby Patty formula
was also the secret to me success.
We serve breakfast till 11, by the way, 12 on weekends.
It wasn't until SpongeBob came to work for me
that I realized the formula is more than just a list of ingredients
and flavor-capturing methods.
It's more than a jealously guarded recipe.
The real secret formula
is sitting right here.
SpongeBob SquarePants.
Get ready.
Ahem! Maestro?

My snail!
Halt! It's a trick! Seize them!
Gary, you're with me now. I'll never let anyone take you again.
[Plankton] Faster!
Yah! Patrick, what are you doing? Free food!
Get him!
Come on, come on. In here!
[soldier] Stop right there!
-[loud thud] -Inside! Quick!
Come on!
Push! Push, Plankton!
You got to be kidding me!
Peekaboo!
[cackles] Attack!
-Attack! -[yelling]
Whoa! Watch your left flank, people!
Thrust! Now parry! Now pirouette. Turn around. Pivot!
Pull harder. Faster! To the right!
Do you think we should've stayed in there with Squidward?
Nah, he's got it.
[Squidward] Where is everybody?!
Charge!
-[yelling] -Squidward!
Squidward! Fall this way!
No, this way!
Man down.
Good catch.
-Hey, there they are! -Get them!
Yo, what's up? Otto!
I have a gambling problem.
Otto! Could anyone lend me some money?
To Bikini Bottom! And step on it!
Stepping on it.
You're all fired.
To the valet!
Leaving so soon, kids?
Hang on, Gary. I won't let you go.
Tsk, tsk. Rather impolite, don't you think?
It was all their idea, sire.
And I…
…loved it!
Wait, so you're not mad at us?
[laughing] No!
It's been a while since I've enjoyed such toe-tapping entertainment.
All is forgiven!
-And all charges are dropped. -Hooray!
On one condition.
SpongeBob will return my snail to me without any more shilly-shally.
Wait, what?
Just hand over the snail and you can all go free.
But… I… I…
[Sage] SpongeBob.
[Spongebob] Sage? Is that you?
Hello.
Sage! Hi!
Remember… The courage you seek is inside you.
And it will come to you in your hour of need.
[Spongebob] The courage is inside me.
The courage is inside me!
Mr. Poseidon, no. I'm sorry, but I won't do it.
What?
I love Gary too much, and he loves me.
If we didn't have each other, we'd be so sad. Well…
It wouldn't really matter what you'd do to us.
And look. Today, thanks to these amazing friends,
my heart feels twice as big a s it ever did.
Especially after what they risked for me:
Flouting the law and defying the mighty king of the sea.
Defying? Really?
I wouldn't say defying the king.
Humiliating you in front of your subjects.
-Do go on. -More like admiring.
And totally agreeing with! I just came to see Kelpy G.
And they did it all for me.
I'm sure you'd understand if you had friends like these.
Friends like these? Wait, what?
Friends like these? Wait, what? Friends like these?
[chuckles] Of course I have friends like these. I have all kinds of friends! I have buddies, I have besties.
I have buddies, I have besties.
I have home-slices, palsy-walsies.
It's infinite!
Chancellor! Give us an exact number. The friend count, if you will.
Uh, okay, according to your latest polling data,
we should get more polling data.
What? Give me that.
Huh?
What about my adoring fans?
-Nope. -My elite palace guards?
-Mm-mm. -[innocent whistling] -What about my personal trainer? -Mmm… Mm-mm.
-My therapist? -Nada.
-My tattoo artist? -Uh…nope.
-My tattoo removal artist? -No dice.
B-But surely you, my chancellor, my loyal faithful…?
Sorry.
Apollo, take me now.
I don't have any friends!
Well, you got one now!
Really? Who is it?
It's me! I'll be your friend.
Do you mean it?
Yes. But friends don't kidnap friends' pet snails.
-[meows] -But I need that snail.
Look, I have a horrible, disgusting wrinkle.
Jumping jellyfish, it's the size of the Mariana Trench!
-[moaning sob] -[laughs] Kidding! Looks don't matter.
We don't care about little imperfections. Or even big ones!
-Just look at Squidward. -What's that supposed to mean?
What's important is what's inside.
And I'm sure you can be a fair and kind king
to all the creatures of the sea. I know you've got it in you, sir.
If you'd just let your hair down a little.
Huh? My hair? Wait a minute.
Are you suggesting that I don't need this gorgeous mane of wavy locks?
That I don't require this neck clip?
Be gone, perfect shiny teeth!
This is so freeing!
To heck with this chest plate and girdle.
-Oh, wow. -Too far? No! Not at all!
[all overlapping] No, you look great!
Oh, thank you! I find this so exhilarating. So… age appropriate.
SpongeBob, few possess the courage to stand up to a powerful king.
You, sir, are among those few. I salute you.
Nailed it, SpongeBob.
Sage out.
You may keep Gary.
And I wish you many happy years together.
Thank you! Did you hear that, Gare-Bear?
Uh, your royal robe, Your Highness.
-It's getting cold out here. -Nonsense, Chancellor.
I'm free!
Ooh, you certainly are.
And free the snails!
What's that?
All of them?
I'm home!
Hello, Gary.
Hello, Brian.
Hello, Janet. Hello, June. Hola, Lupe.
-Morning, Sally! -Hi, Brett!
Come on, Gary! You can do it!
Yeah!
Fabio! Where are you, buddy?
Here, Fabio, Fabio, Fabio!
The third case of police brutality in two months rocks the country.
No comment from the Ministry of the Interior.
We spoke to the Chief Inspector.
My brother died at 00:30.
We're yet to ID the officers in the video.
An exhaustive investigation has been promised.
Justice will be served.
In memory of Idir,
my little brother, please stay calm
at tomorrow's silent march.
Thank you.
Thank you, Abdel.
It is beyond belief that officers would close ranks
and feign ignorance in the small community of Athena.
I ask the justice system
to identify and arrest these criminal officers
in the name of one of France's great families,
a family who fought for our country.
Idir's grandfather was an Algerian Fusilier.
Abdel recently returned from Mali with many medals.
At the request of Idir's family,
a complaint will be filed shortly…
Stop!
I said stop!
Where's Karim?
Get off me!
Stop this madness!
Karim!
Find the weapons!
Come on!
Stop shooting!
We're the police now!
Fucking dirty feds!
Find the weapons!
We're the police, we're the police…
Karim, we found the safe!
This way.
-Open it! -We ain't got no tools.
Let's take it!
-Take it all, even the helmets! -Found the flash balls!
Give it to 'em!
Karim, I found the car park!
This way!
Bring the safe!
Cover them!
Hold up!
When they get here, we bounce!
Go!
Get in!
Floor it!
Go!
Faster!
We fucked you up!
Get back to the 'hood!
Athena!
That's how it's done!
Get down!
Grab this, fam. Come on!
Quick!
Go to Block 3 with the others!
Got a smoke?
Not now.
We gonna win this war!
We gonna fuck 'em up!
Rachid, tell 'em we're on our way. Call 'em!
Almost there. Be ready!
We nicked their shit!
Gimme that!
Fifou ain't answerin'!
Higher!
To the right!
Let 'em know it's us!
Are they fucking dumb?
We're not feds, you fucks!
Torch the van!
It's Karim! Open up!
This is dope! Even the siren works!
See the tracksuits I got?
We're like an army now.
It's like our uniform!
They won't be able to tell us apart! We nicked 'em from the football club.
Tell 'em to hurl shit faster! Don't wait for me.
Grabbed some walkie-talkies.
We're a real team. Like an army!
We got another 30 tracksuits. They're dope!
Take that to the lobby.
Can't we get any peace? Leave! We can't take it!
Karim, I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you. Please stay inside. Close the windows. Don't come out.
Knock it off! Put the safe in the cellar! Crack it open with a power saw!
-Ready? -Aim for my body, not my head.
Let's see if this works.
Live from the Athena estate.
We beat up the feds!
Lil' demo of our police gear.
-Shoot! -Ready or not?
Did it hurt? Did you like it?
-Ya did, right? -Fuck off!
Athena! Athena! Athena!
Are you dumb? Think this is a game?
It's war till we get those feds' names.
-We ain't playin'! -Clock's tickin'.
Cheers!
How old?
Four.
Twin girls.
Put your gloves on.
Gentlemen, you have the plans.
You can see the main blocks
built around a central courtyard over a main road.
Traffic is now cut off.
Barricades block all entrances.
We intend to weaken them. We launch a synchronised attack at dusk.
The youths may have firearms.
Stay alert.
Any questions? No?
Let's go!
Live from the Athena estate.
Police fear the presence of Sébastien L, a man on the terrorist watch list.
"…the truth should come to light."
"Chaos won't stop until the officers in the video are ID'd."
We hit two by two!
Faster!
No wonder kids show you no respect.
Shit's goin' south outside.
You stash your gear, pick it up the next day.
Come and go as you please. Take your shoes off!
-Moktar? -He ain't even listenin'!
You didn't even notice the new welcome mat!
-Where's the rest? -What?
The coke, darlin'. Where is it?
-In the toilet! -Shit place to hide it.
Go! In the tank?
Thieving off me now? Stupid fat bitch.
Get a move on!
Guy thinks this is a holiday.
We'll be at the barrier with the ambulance in five.
-Tell your boys we're evacuating someone. -Copy that.
We'll link up later, you know the spot.
Lil' fuck scared me!
You lot are pissin' me off! Go!
Move it, dickhead!
What's your deal?
Hurry!
-Got the shovels. -Nice one!
-We got the guns. -Where we going?
My narc contact is waiting to let us out.
Bury this in the woods till this shithole calms down.
The heat is on!
What the fuck is this?
-What the hell? -Your brother wants to pass.
No one leaves.
You kids need to stop this bullshit. Want every fed in the county here?
You can't pass. No one leaves.
Fuck!
Get outta here! The feds!
Head to the shisha bar. We'll stash this there.
Go, go, go!
Go upstairs!
Fucking move!
Outta my way!
Let me pass. Shut the fuck up. Guys, chill!
Calm the fuck down!
Across the square. Don't stop!
There's Moktar!
They can't hold us up. Chop chop!
They're harmless. Let 'em yap!
What's in the bags?
-The fuck you want? -What's in the bags?
Who you talking to?
Fuck you! Motherfucker!
What's in the bag?
Give us the bags!
The bags, the bags…
I'll fucking bag your mum!
-Get the fuck outta here! -Hurry up!
Cross!
-Open the door! -What's up?
Chill! What the fuck?
Fuck you all!
What is this?
You're either with us or against us.
Karim, don't play this game with me. This ain't the way.
Says you!
I'm protecting my business.
-Idir's dead, and you talk business? -Tell your boys to move!
Got guns in those bags?
Think you're hard? I ain't scared of you.
Give me the guns.
Shut the fuck up!
I mean it. Give me the guns!
-The feds are comin'! -Head to the roof of B7!
This ain't over. Leave and you die!
Sheikh, it's crazy outside.
We need to dampen the youth's fire. We should ask for calm.
If this fire becomes a blaze, we can't fight it.
They threw a Molotov indoors.
A fire broke out. We put it out. Alhamdulillah.
We should evacuate the families.
-Lions calm their cubs. -These cubs are wild!
Give the metaphors a rest.
When are you gonna get it? These kids are savage!
They hit me with a crowbar!
They looted the police station!
Do we wait it out? Wait for someone to die?
Calm down.
Evacuate thousands? What if some refuse?
Leave anyone mad enough to wanna stay!
Please calm down.
Talk to him! His brother's their leader.
Family of thugs!
No one touches him!
Calm down. Abdel, should we evacuate?
We listen to oppressors now?
Evacuate the vulnerable first.
-I'll find Karim and reason with him. -You'd better!
Find and isolate Sébastien. He's a threat.
Go and evacuate the families calmly.
-Let's do this. -Start with B9.
If you see any youngsters, bring them along.
Saber, help Abdel find his brother.
And if you see Sébastien, get him outta here. Go on.
-Start with B4. -Jump on my bike.
Come outside, please!
Karim's phone. Leave a message.
I want a woman!
Stop!
See if he's at the back.
Karim!
Stop! They'll gun you down. Where's Karim?
Dunno!
Stop shooting! We're letting the families leave!
You can't stay.
Don't tell me what to do!
You can't stay here, madam.
See him?
Go to B7.
Follow the kids!
Slow down!
There's Sébastien.
What do we do?
We're taking the families somewhere quiet. Come with us.
We gotta go now!
Please. It's gonna be okay.
This way.
No! To the daycare!
Stop! There are families coming through!
Calm down.
Come this way.
Go!
-Hurry up, kids. -You have to leave, madam.
-Anyone left inside? -No.
Sit here.
You'll be fine. We'll be back.
Close the curtains.
I locked up.
Stay put. I'll see if Karim's home. Don't let him leave.
What you doing here?
You can't stay!
We're with you.
Be strong.
Sorry for your loss.
My condolences.
It'll be okay. Stay strong.
-Where's Karim? -What do you care?
-Pray for Idir. -Mum, you can't stay.
-Take this off. Go pray. -Please.
-Pray for your brother. -Okay, then we go.
Everyone leave, please. You're not safe here.
Help me. Evacuate calmly.
Quickly.
Quickly but calmly.
Where's Karim?
Where's Mum? I'm talking to you!
-She's in the convoy. -Go and help her!
Aren't you the soldier?
-We'll talk later. -I'm staying!
What? Still like obeying orders?
-After what they did? -Nonsense.
-Why not let it burn? -Shut up!
You don't want it to burn or to start a war, not here.
The war has started.
That's right, fuck off!
Abdel, where you going?
Come join us!
What's the hold-up?
Calm her down.
This is all your fault!
You're gonna drop me!
You're useless!
Letting kids take over.
Help us out!
You can't even tame them. Useless shits!
Thank you, fam.
Mum!
-Where were you? -Go to Aunt Myriam's.
-Where's Karim? -He is safe.
-He isn't coming? -He'll be in the next convoy.
He's fragile.
Be there for him.
Keep it moving! Everyone out!
Careful. Stop pushing!
-Out of the way! -Easy now!
ATHENA: URBAN WARFARE
You two, pick that up!
Go on! Hurry!
To the left!
Hold it…
Now!
Turn around!
Shield!
Fall back!
Look out!
I'm pissin' on you pigs! Fuck you!
I'm pissing on the feds! They can't do shit!
Break into flats. Grab what you can.
We got your back.
Karim, it's Mum. I'm worried. I can't get hold of you. Are you okay?
Be careful, darling. Call me back.
…an outburst of violence, triggered by a video that's gone viral on social media
showing Idir, 13, being restrained by three officers.
He is brutally beaten and left for dead.
In a dramatic turn of events,
sources claim the attackers may not have been officers,
but far-right extremists aiming to aggravate recent tension…
Feds breakin' into B1!
Follow me!
Get off me!
Push the dumpsters!
Ram it!
Retreat!
Sorry you got arrested. I'm embarrassed to have to uncuff you.
Let them go. They wanted to help.
If I could, I'd free them. Once in custody, it's all red tape.
I issued a report to find out who did what.
Such a scandal.
Scandal over casualties?
Let me talk to them.
The raid's about to begin. No one in or out.
The commander's waiting.
I need you here. You're not under arrest.
-Sarcelles here to help! -Tarterêts!
-Les Pyramides! -Tremblay!
-Bosquets! -Bobigny!
This isn't a victory!
They'll be back to fuck us up!
We want Idir's killers.
We ain't just thugs torchin' shit!
Socials and the news say they might not be feds.
Says who?
Since when do we trust socials or the news?
We're done bein' seen as victims!
When they strike,
we strike back!
When they kill,
we kill!
They talk about unrest?
We'll show 'em unrest!
I got a plan.
We snatch a fed.
Then they'll have to listen to us.
Athena!
Unit, halt!
March on!
Single file!
Officer down!
Charge!
Got him! Fall back!
Hold the line!
Everyone, fall back!
-Got one here! -Catch him!
Get him!
Where is he?
You can't hide!
We find you, you're dead!
It's him!
Get back!
You too! I'll kill you!
We need to stand firm
and to not let these thugs burn our city down.
Very well, but how?
Boost funding for manpower and equipment.
These are lawless neighbourhoods, ruled by dealers and fundamentalists.
Order must be restored. Our laws must apply.
We need to rearm the police, morally and materially.
In those neighbourhoods, we've funded useless organisations
to avoid these uprisings.
But they happen anyway. Why?
These neighbourhoods are becoming no-go areas.
The military is just one solution.
The way you speak is shocking. "Us" and "them".
We are all the same. We are one society.
We've been stuck here for hours. Pick us up!
-Access was refused. -What?
-Plan's fucked. -"Fucked"?
Shut up! It's not fucked! You do this, you'll be fucked!
Guy's diggin' a hole to China!
Play your part or I'll give the kids guns!
I'll turn this place into Sarajevo!
Keep fucking playin' me!
Keep diggin'! Did I say stop? Big, fat fuck!
Look at the camera.
For those murdered by the police,
we demand Idir's murderers be identified and given life sentences.
We stand firm. If our demands are not met…
Know the location?
…he dies.
Does their location appear on this map?
Your co-operation is vital.
We don't want more casualties.
Reason with your brother.
I'll go and get him back.
If you send the cavalry, it'll get ugly.
The tactical unit will talk to you. Just give them some site intel.
Thank you.
We'll find whoever did this, be they cops or not.
We need time.
Want a coffee?
Thank you.
Where you going?
Come back!
A fed! Fuck him up!
It's Karim's brother!
Abdel's joined our movement!
Abdel is with us! Abdel is with us!
Block the entrance!
Karim's phone. Leave a message.
-Abdel! What you doin'? -Shut your mouth!
It's your brother. What do I do?
Break time's over.
You'll go down for years, if they don't shoot you first.
I'm takin' the cop.
What the hell?
-Name? -Jérôme.
Let's get you outta here.
What you doin'?
You don't get it. They want this mayhem. Let it go.
No, you don't get it.
They won't tell us who killed Idir. I ain't letting shit go!
Won't let go?
You get the names, then what?
Will it bring Idir back?
What's done is done.
He's dead.
Please come with me, brother. Come home.
Come with me.
Think about Mum.
She's suffered enough, miskina.
Get off!
Traitor! You fight for them, you harki!
Don't play my big bro. You're a military whore for France!
I don't even know you.
You should've died, not Idir!
I know.
What you doin'?
I'm talking to you!
Follow me.
Don't let 'em get away!
To your right!
This way!
The door!
This way!
Police! Stop! On the ground!
Stop shooting! He's one of you!
Come on!
They're over here!
Open up! It's Abdel! Open it!
Open the door!
Get in!
Any closer, I'll shoot you!
Motherfuckers! I'll tear you a new one!
Yeah, come on!
Bastards!
Keep running! Little bitches!
Well?
When you got scared after school, you'd run to me for protection.
Good to see you, lil' bro.
Missed you.
Can't you reason with our brother? They've gone wild.
Forget about it. This new generation is fucked.
Got another exit?
Fuck, Idir…
I barely knew him. The fuckers took him from me. Give me a hug.
We're family. It's all we got.
Never let go.
Fuck… We're family, united. That can't ever change.
Even if we have different dads or it takes war for you to come,
you're my flesh and blood!
-Feel me? -Is there another exit?
There's my GI Joe!
A door at the back. We blocked it.
Who's this?
That's the fed on TV!
Everyone's after him!
I'm getting him out.
You brought a fed here?
Keep diggin', dickhead! No time to stop!
You okay?
You mad? He saw our guns, our faces.
Dig deeper. I waste him, we bury him here.
Or you save his life and you're a hero.
Me? A hero?
Who's that? More feds? I don't give a fuck!
Fine, we get him out, but my way.
My narcs will come and get him.
Yeah? Sorry about earlier, got carried away.
I think I found a way out of our situation.
You guys wanna be heroes?
We'll get you out. Don't worry.
When?
-About ten minutes. -That works.
Problem solved.
Okay, big guy? Must be hungry. Twix?
Take it. I got Yop. Raspberry, strawberry…
The strawberry one's smaller. Want the lil' one?
You shy? He's shy. Big guys don't cry!
He's looks like a child. You babysit him.
We can't attack. Your brothers are in there.
They ain't my brothers no more. We'll smoke 'em out.
Hi, Mum.
Don't worry. Be home soon.
Sorry.
I love you, Mum.
Use this.
Knock down the back wall. I'll be out front. Bring me the fed.
-What about the chopper? -Don't give a fuck.
Hand over the fed!
The riot squad will see you!
I don't give a shit! Let 'em come. I want the fed!
It's too late. Go!
-Hand him over or burn! -Go!
I'll kill you all!
My narcs are comin'.
-You trust them? -They're safe. Tell him to scram!
He's fucking everything up!
You can't stay here. They're coming.
I'll torch this place!
It's too late!
-Think I'm playin'? -What you doing? Stop!
Bring him out or I'll torch it!
Hello? Hold on a sec. Coming!
-Put it out! -Hand him over!
-Don't push me! -Put it out!
What you doin' here? What the fuck have you done?
-Don't force me. -It's over.
-Put it out! -On the count of three.
It's too late.
-Stop it! -Don't push me.
-Police! -Put down the Molotov!
-Drop your weapon! I'll shoot! -On the ground!
Stop!
Get down!
Get down! I said get down!
Be brave, brother.
It ain't your fault.
Gotta get rid of the guns. Too dangerous.
Too many kids here. We gotta go.
You can save 'em all.
Anyone wants out…
now's the time.
Put down your weapons.
Go through the building.
Break down the walls.
Get the guns.
Close the shutter!
We'll show you!
Gonna chop your finger off!
Chop his finger off!
-I didn't do anything. -Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!
What's going on? I said to stay put!
Some dirty cops barged in. It wasn't our call.
We need proof our officer is alive. I feel your pain…
-Bring him upstairs. -You heard him! Move it!
Come quick. We got a situation.
Right here.
What do we do with him?
We blocked all entry.
Couldn't crack this. There's guns inside.
Help 'em out.
Gather any fireworks, gas tanks and petrol.
You, sister,
get me a fruit juice.
Carry on.
You'll pay for this! It's all your fault!
We'll burn your 'hoods to the ground!
We're worried. How can I help?
I want the cops who killed Idir.
Within the hour, or he dies. Calm down.
Put it on Snap. Pile the pressure on!
…the situation is out of hand.
24 hours after the video of the fatal assault of Idir  leaked,
all of France is in turmoil.
Thirty cities are experiencing unprecedented violence.
Police stations have been ransacked, mosques set ablaze.
A large far-right group just stormed Dijon town hall.
Police forces throughout France are overwhelmed.
Sources say the army will soon be deployed.
Sorry about your brothers.
Chaos reigns as hundreds of youths storm the area.
I need help. This family won't leave.
Fuck! What do we do?
Watch him.
-Who told you to shoot? -Sébastien. So they can't retaliate.
-Who told you to shoot? -Sébastien. So they can't retaliate. Where is he?
Settin' up the gas tanks.
No one stays! Go!
Get out!
-What's goin' on? -This is my home! I won't leave!
What are you doing?
Let go of my dad!
Take your kids and go!
Stop filming!
Sébastien!
Do that on every floor.
Gas tank!
Gas tank!
Petrol!
Sébastien!
We're evacuating the last families. Just you and the youths left. Surrender.
-You find 'em? -Who?
They're not police!
Bring 'em.
I wanna see 'em.
We think it's a far-right group. They aren't our men. It's over.
-Bring 'em, or I do him. -You aren't hearing me!
Bring them to me! We don't know where they're from.
Calm down!
The tactical unit is coming… I'll kill him!
I'll kill him.
We set up all the gas tanks. Now what?
-What's going on? -Film.
That's enough!
-You bringing 'em, yes or no? -Now isn't the time to lose it!
-Please! Spare me! -What the hell?
-Abdel! -Bring 'em to me. Yes or no?
-I'm begging you! -Let him live!
You bringing 'em, yes or no?
No! They're not police, okay?
Let him go!
Stop! It's pointless!
Stop, Abdel! What the fuck? Don't do it!
Please, I beg you!
Sébastien's gone mental! He wants to blow up the block!
We gotta bail!
Let's go. We have to go!
We can't stay here! Fuck this!
Wait up!
CIVIL WAR IN FRANCE
1879 (12TH YEAR OF THE NEW AGE) YOKOHAMA STATION
You'll hurt yourselves!
Rintaro!
Was it you who sold a warship
to Makoto Shishio?
What might this be about?
We are told
a Shanghai arms dealer is on the train.
How rude!
This gentleman represents--
Shouldn't you start by introducing yourself?
You're Japanese?
You are Goro Fujita, Bureau of Police?
Or
is it Hajime Saito, formerly of the Shogun police?
You want weapons too? I'll sell you all you want.
Ironclads, Gatling guns, Snider rifles…
Now that the Satsuma Rebellion's over, I've got lots.
Bring him.
On your feet.
I wouldn't.
Where's Battôsai the Killer?
Why is the Shanghai mafia asking?
Does he still have
the scars on his cheek?
What?
Well?
Does he still have the cross of scars on his cheek?
He does, huh?
They're still there?
I guess my sister still hates him.
You want a fight, Shinsengumi?
Halt!
Hold it!
You want me?
I'm all yours.
Take him!
ASAKUSA, TOKYO
Sorry.
That bride looks fine!
Good for you!
Will you look at that!
Well!
All these new Western ways.
A white kimono would be nice, but I'd like that dress too.
How many weddings are you planning to have?
I prefer the old hairstyles.
-Why? -What?
They suit an old head?
Kaoru?
Kaoru! You're staring into space.
She's imagining she's marrying Kenshin.
You're a kid with a big mouth!
Cut it out!
Oh, Kenshin.
It is certainly very beautiful.
Ms. Kaoru?
What's wrong?
Figure it out.
Huh?
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS MINISTRY BUREAU OF POLICE TRAINING GROUND
Begin!
We've finally started.
Very good.
Mr. Maekawa.
Chief Uramura.
Several men from my dojo are serving as instructors here.
They are?
It's been 12 years since the Restoration.
These young men have never seen war.
Japan has sent troops to Taiwan and now to Korea.
We're still arguing with China
over our claim that Okinawa is ours.
There could be war with China at any time.
TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS
Thanks for coming out.
You're nothing but trouble.
If you would confirm transfer…
He wants you to confirm the transfer.
Thank you.
Come on.
Why the hell did we free a Shanghai mafia boss?
We didn't free him.
He was released into custody of the consul under the terms of our treaty.
Why should China judge a violation of our law?
They have jurisdiction.
It's the same with a Japanese in China.
Enter.
Remember Cho?
One of Shishio's Ten Swords.
He's been working undercover for us.
Thanks for your help back then.
I don't trust turncoats.
Oh, dear!
Don't be like that.
He'll keep an eye on what Shanghai's doing.
You know the drill.
BEEF HOT POT AKABEKO
Bring more! This isn't enough.
I'm starving!
Beef! It's been a while.
Right?
Here you are.
Great!
Where were you?
Fencing with the constables at the Police Dojo.
It's busy here.
Tae works us hard.
Find a boyfriend like Kaoru too, and I'll give you time off.
Tae, stop it!
Oh?
You stop it too!
Anyway, let's eat.
That's hot!
Why are you shoving it in?
You shut up.
Calm down, Kaoru!
I am calm.
I'm stuffed!
Pig!
And you eat too much meat.
Your face is still red.
You shut up. I'm not blushing.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I'm fine.
It's time you got used to peace.
If you would, Kujiranami.
The opening shot of vengeance.
What was that noise?
Move!
Stand aside!
Out of the way!
Move!
Mr. Himura!
What's going on, Chief?
What's up?
Someone fired a cannon into the city!
They hit a beef place called Akabeko.
Akabeko?
It came from Ueno Hill. We'll surround the area.
They might shoot again.
Be careful.
I'll go with the Chief. Go check on Akabeko.
-Okay. -I'll come too!
Come on!
What's going on?
Tae! Tsubame!
Search the area!
Only a shrine tree snapped off.
Not even a trace of a gun mount.
They probably used the tree to stop the recoil.
Even if they did aim and fire from here,
surely, they couldn't hit Akabeko!
Chief!
-Chief! -Yes?
We found this.
"Man judges"?
It's usually, "Heaven judges." Don't they even know that?
No.
Someone will pass judgment in Heaven's place.
JUSTIFICATION FOR EXECUTION
The shogunate and the Shinsengumi…
They both justified their killings that way.
So this means…
I think someone's saying if Heaven will not judge,
then they will.
I see.
So some malcontents are still unhappy with the new government.
We can't have that.
-Follow me. -Yes, sir!
-Search every corner of this area! -Yes, sir!
Anyone in mind?
No.
The man from Shanghai?
He sold Shishio that ship.
He said something.
"Does Battôsai still have his scars?"
MAN JUDGES
OGUNI CLINIC
Hey!
More bandages!
We've used everything we had. I'll get more.
Thanks.
I'm finished here.
-Press down on that wound. -Yes.
Megumi!
How are you doing?
As best I can.
Tae!
Tsubame!
She got burned trying to get people out.
Kaoru and Yahiko just left.
Oh, I see.
What a thing to do!
Ms. Kaoru? Yahiko?
Are you all right?
Yes. We were checking on the injured at Megumi's clinic.
Tsubame and Tae?
Anyway, who could have done something this horrible?
Megumi, can I ask you something?
What?
Kenshin's scars…
They're pretty old. Why don't they fade?
I don't know.
I asked Dr. Oguni about that once.
And?
It was half superstition.
He said a scar inflicted in righteous anger
won't disappear until that anger is appeased.
You're still up?
Sano…
So what's going on that we don't know about?
Kenshin…
I understand very well
that you don't want to worry Kaoru, Yahiko, and Megumi.
But…
surely you can tell me.
What's that noise?
Mr. Himura! Open up!
Mr. Himura!
Come quick! The Maekawa Dojo!
What?
An attack.
It's a slaughter. The police came,
but they're no match!
-I'll come! -No.
I'll be back by morning. Keep the gate shut tight.
You're in charge.
Mr. Himura!
-Mr. Himura! -What now?
Have Chief Uramura put guards at the Kamiya Dojo and Oguni Clinic.
There's no word from the Chief.
We're going there now.
Kenshin.
Leave the Maekawa Dojo to me. You go to the Chief's.
I thank you.
URAMURA
Put that down, or I'll shoot!
Fool!
You think that thing will stop me?
Husband!
Who are you? What do you want?
What the hell's going on?
Okay, who's next?
Damn you!
What do you want?
Oh, relax!
You won't be lonely.
You can all die together.
No! Kill me instead!
Don't hate me for this.
Instead…
Hate me?
Quite enough people hate me already.
Left cheek, crossed scars…
Mr. Himura! Be careful!
So it's you?
Battôsai the Killer?
Perfect.
Tell me…
who's using you for revenge?
A good guy.
We used to see who could kill the most in a night.
It was fun.
So you've led a life of shame too.
We're two of a kind.
If you're after revenge, I'll fight all you want.
But don't drag others into this.
Mementos of my god-given gift!
Get out!
Hey!
Are you alive?
I'm too late!
What happened?
I know what you're thinking.
"Who are these guys?"
"How many of them are there?"
"Who's the leader?" "Where will they attack next?"
Suffer, then.
Now
man judges.
Mr. Himura!
Why?
Why us?
Why?
What's the matter,
Battôsai?
You look as if you've seen my sister's ghost?
You…
It can't be…
What if it is?
Will you kill me?
Like you did her?
With that filthy sword?
It's been 14 years.
I went to Shanghai, nearly died there, and worked my way up
to the top of the Shanghai mafia.
All the while
planning to come back and avenge my sister.
Just wait.
Man's judgment is at hand.
The men with me hate you too.
And we are capable of anything.
Battôsai…
I don't want to simply cause you pain.
I want you to suffer.
Kenshin's here.
What's all this trouble about?
Hey, Kenshin.
Kenshin!
Welcome back, Kenshin.
I'll get some rest.
Something's not right.
I've never seen him look so tormented before.
Tokyo is now on high alert.
The dojo of fencing instructor Maekawa was attacked last night.
As was the home of Chief Uramura.
Most of the officers who responded were injured.
We don't know who the attackers were.
However,
this is clearly a challenge to police authorities.
Our dignity is at stake.
We must preserve public order in Tokyo!
It wasn't easy, but I found them.
Their armory.
They've taken a place in Yokohama.
A man named Wu Heixing. A Shanghai millionaire.
Lack of scruples makes good spies.
Thanks a lot!
I was one of the Ten Swords.
Like I'd really work for the new regime!
After yesterday's events,
we have 30 comrades stationed in the compound.
Come in.
It's been a while, boss.
Heixing?
When did you come back from Shanghai?
I was told you're finishing up what you came to do.
I just wanted to make sure you remembered our deal.
I remember.
Once I'm done, the organization is yours.
Arms, opium… Do what you like.
Japan will be yours.
Good news, Tomoe.
It's finally time for heaven to levy judgment on Battôsai.
Enishi… Not you!
You didn't know?
They said they had told you.
Go home, Enishi.
You're our family's son.
-Don't get mixed up in this. -To hell with the family!
It's you I want to--
Go home, Enishi.
Why?
What happened?
Why protect him? He's your enemy!
He stole your happiness. You should want revenge!
KAMIYA DOJO
Last night after you two went out,
Yahiko said…
he was sick of being weak.
In his own way, he senses that trouble's coming.
He's trying to strengthen himself.
Then I should talk to you all.
Ms. Kaoru, get everyone together.
Last night, the Maekawa Dojo and Chief Uramura's home were attacked.
All to take vengeance on me.
Vengeance on you?
The Akabeko attack too.
They were planned by a man named Enishi Yukishiro.
Brother to Tomoe Himura…
my wife, who I stabbed to death.
As the shogunate fell…
when…
I got these scars.
Woman, pour us a drink.
We're out day and night risking our lives for the likes of you.
Kyoto's no place for fake patriots.
You're mine!
I thought I'd come out and say thank you.
You really…
make it rain blood.
I'll stay with you…
a while longer.
What is happiness?
I feel like living here with you has answered that question for me.
I was
engaged to be married.
Before the wedding
in the unrest in Kyoto, he made the ultimate sacrifice.
If you want revenge,
get close to Battôsai and find out all you can about him.
Find his weak points.
Tomoe…
the happiness you've lost once…
you will never lose again.
April 5th.
Before our wedding, Kiyosato made the ultimate sacrifice.
I can't die!
There's someone I love.
I want to avenge Kiyosato.
Tomoe…
Tomoe…
Tomoe…
You're angry too.
Are you all right?
This is the first you've heard about this Tomoe person.
Yes. It's a surprise.
But… I feel sorry for her somehow.
Perhaps she was very pure of heart.
She hated herself for falling for
the man who'd killed her first love.
And so…
maybe she meant for him to stab her.
I'm sure…
Kenshin will never forget Tomoe.
To love someone like that… so deeply…
and…
have her die by your hand.
You'd never forget that.
But
you and Kenshin are alive.
If you're alive, you can move on together.
Now that Tomoe's dead, that's one thing she can't do.
Go on. Go to him.
Kenshin.
Ms. Kaoru…
I know you hate troubling people. I thought you might vanish again.
Thank you.
One gem after another!
Well!
A wo-dao Chinese sword! I've never seen one before.
What? I'm busy here.
You, huh?
The sword thief who lost to Battôsai and switched sides?
Sword hunter!
Whatever.
I sent the police to the wrong place, just like that Chinese guy Wu said to.
That deserves some reward.
This is a great sword.
It could hurt you.
The balance is different than Japanese swords.
You seem sure of yourself.
Do you hate Battôsai too?
All of a sudden,
I want to test this blade.
KAMIYA DOJO
Thank you for your efforts this past year.
-Thank you, master. -Thank you, master.
Dismissed!
-Yes! -Yes!
Take a break, and then we clean!
-Yes! -Yes!
Now,
man judges.
Why?
Why us?
MAN JUDGES
Hello!
Howdy!
Misao!
How are you?
What are you doing here? Did you come from Kyoto?
It took so long! Tokyo's so far away!
Of course it is. Did you come alone?
Aoshi too?
Is Himura here?
So what brings you here anyway?
The Suikoji Temple priest
heard from his late father that Himura had something to do with Elder's death.
The father apparently knew Himura.
Imagine that.
Battôsai fighting alongside the Shogun's Hidden Watchers!
Fate works in strange ways.
Himura is living quietly in Tokyo now.
I see.
If you have the chance, could you take him a message?
My father had his late wife's diary, and I'd like to return it.
He often spoke with my father
about how one who had killed so many
should then lead his life.
Or even if he still should live.
Here.
This is Tomoe's diary?
You knew about her?
Did you read it?
I couldn't do that!
I'm sure it's important to Himura, so I brought it.
THE HEART TO LIVE IN AUTHENTIC TRUTH
The Watchers told me
something interesting.
They said in December, Tokyo will rain blood.
And Battôsai will be the cause.
YOKOHAMA WAREHOUSE DISTRICT
Squad 2, around to the left.
Squad 3, secure the back door.
We charge in.
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.
It's a damn trap!
This should buy us some time.
What's this? A newspaper extra?
What is it?
MAN JUDGES
What's that?
Look!
What's that noise?
The same as before.
Captain Aoshi!
I have to go!
Let the festival begin!
Take us down.
Follow that.
Do whatever you have to.
Understood.
Man's judgment is at hand.
The men with me hate you too.
And we are capable of anything.
Battôsai…
I don't want to simply cause you pain.
I want you to suffer.
Are you all right?
Thank you!
Hurry!
Is Battôsai here?
This is for him!
Go.
Upstairs! Hurry!
Thank you!
Who are you?
Evil powers
will bury evil-doers in darkness.
As the last captain of the Hidden Watchers,
that is my task.
Whoever you are,
you don't get in the way of Mumyoi!
Don't just stand there!
You too!
Who are you?
Is it you?
Kenshin's brother-in-law?
Well, he's not here.
But
if you've come looking for a fight, I'll give you one.
You will, huh?
Big talk from tiny glasses!
Captain Aoshi!
Captain Aoshi!
It's Battôsai we want!
Not you!
Sanosuke!
Guys, when you're in a fight,
you use your head!
Captain Aoshi!
Captain Aoshi…
Captain Aoshi!
Captain Aoshi!
Captain Aoshi!
He shielded me.
Are you all right?
Thank you!
Captain Aoshi!
Captain Aoshi!
Damn it!
Wait, Battôsai!
Finish me off.
To restore the Emperor,
you stole our samurai pride.
You denied us…
an honorable death.
So now…
with those hands…
give me that now!
That much
you owe me!
Run me through!
I'm sorry.
I have sworn that with this blade, I will never kill again.
Live in the new age.
Freeze!
Then at least cut off this arm!
Come quietly!
Because if I still have it…
Battôsai!
Battôsai!
Kill me! Please!
Sano!
Ken…
Kaoru…
Sorry.
I'm sorry!
He took Kaoru.
I couldn't stop him.
I couldn't do anything…
but watch.
Now you look good.
Hold it!
Keep your hands off her!
Don't worry.
Yahiko!
"The heart to live in authentic truth"?
That's dumb.
Are you Enishi Yukishiro?
So what if I am?
Killing Kenshin or me won't bring Tomoe back.
You just lose your soul…
a prisoner of your rage.
How do you know her?
Did you hear that…
from Battôsai?
My sister's name?
Here, I shall levy man's judgment.
There's no escape.
Man's judgment requires your death.
Tomoe would not have wanted this.
Silence.
How would you know?
Die!
Die!
You don't speak for her. Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Why?
Why do you look so sad?
Why won't you smile?
TO LIVE IN AUTHENTIC TRUTH
The man I met
is a wanderer named Kenshin.
Wandering is the easy way out.
To help you out, why else?
That sword is for you.
Your life does not belong only to you.
Worry about your own life before someone else's.
I must not let him die now.
I will preserve him
though it means my life.
Kenshin!
Are you going?
Yahiko…
look after Sano.
The first one to find him kills him.
All right?
Suit yourself.
Come on.
You called?
It's a bit soon,
but the organization is yours.
Why is that?
My private war is almost over.
It's not as easy as that, boss.
The Japanese police have gotten wind of this place.
If you lose and they take you in again, our government won't be--
Heixing!
What did you say?
Do you think I might lose?
No, never.
Get out of here.
One more word, and I'll kill you too!
Are you turning tail?
Shut up!
We'll kill Battôsai, and then Yukishiro too.
Mr. Wu…
Thank you for your help in Kyoto.
I understand you might have some work for me.
You! Halt!
Halt!
So you're Battôsai?
We've been waiting.
Himura!
Don't go keeping this to yourself!
Ms. Misao!
For Aoshi Shinomori, Captain of the Edo Hidden Watchers,
Misao Makimachi stands with you!
This is my job.
Kenshin!
Sano?
Out of the way!
Kenshin, go!
Go, Himura!
Go!
Damn it!
Go around!
I don't have time to play now.
"Play"?
How dare you!
I hold the trump card here!
The greatest of the Ten Swords assassins, Sojiro Seta!
Do your worst!
You!
It's been a while, Mr. Himura.
Hey! What are you doing?
I became a wanderer too.
After Mr. Himura beat me, my life lost meaning.
It's been a while since I drew a sword,
but I'm probably better than you.
Get them! Kill them both!
That was fun.
It's nice not having to worry about your back for a change.
Go on ahead, Mr. Himura.
And show me
how that sword cuts old hatreds and frees those trapped in the past.
I thank you.
Come on.
So you're here…
Battôsai.
Sorry to keep you.
Where's Ms. Kaoru?
Indeed…
I wonder.
Enishi,
it's perfectly natural you'd want to avenge your sister.
But stop pulling other people into it.
Your enemy is me alone. I alone bear the guilt.
Shut up!
It's not you alone. It's all of you.
Your friends, everyone you talk to,
and all of this shit country you've made!
Tomoe…
the time has come at last.
Man's judgment is at hand.
Well, Battôsai?
Does your wound hurt like my sister's?
I'm damn sure it doesn't!
Die!
Only death can repay the sin of murder.
Writhe in agony, and die in regret and despair!
That is the only way you can atone!
Stand up!
This does not
atone for your crime.
Stand up, Battôsai!
What's wrong?
Can't take any more?
Then kill yourself.
Turn that phony back-blade on yourself
and die.
Bastard.
You kill more than you can count, and you're afraid to kill yourself?
Battôsai!
I've thought about death many times.
But I knew my death would never atone for my sins.
Quit your babbling.
I still have no idea…
how to atone.
But now…
for my friends…
and for the peace that Tomoe wanted…
Enishi…
I have to stop you.
Enishi…
do you see Tomoe…
smiling now?
How could my sister fall for you?
Your feelings for her are not wrong.
Nor is your hatred for me.
But the way you are living
is very wrong.
End this.
Tomoe…
Tomoe…
Battôsai!
Damn you!
Enishi…
I'm sorry.
You think I'm some kind of joke!
I'll kill you!
-All of you! -No!
Keep out of my way.
Bastard!
Heixing!
Don't get in my way!
No!
Stop!
You'll kill him!
You will!
Thank you for protecting…
Ms. Kaoru.
No…
No!
Kenshin.
I wanted to protect…
The one I wanted to protect…
Tomoe!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Enishi Yukishiro, this came for you.

-Five! -Five!
-Six! -Six!
Don't overdo it.
Be quiet.
That hurt!
Don't overdo it.
What did you tell Tomoe?
Thank you, I guess.
In the end, Enishi saved me.
But now I think maybe it was Tomoe watching over me.
Enishi Yukishiro…
I wonder how he's doing.
He will have to atone as well.
Not with his death, but with his life.
Until he does that…
the Tomoe in his mind will not smile.
Kenshin…
what did you say to Tomoe?
The same as you.
Thank you.
And
I'm sorry, and…
With Japan now open to foreign trade,
some seek to end the Shogun's rule
and restore the Emperor's authority.
Ambitions swirl together with ideals.
Opposing factions face each other.
Fighting spreads through the land.
Trouble!
There's trouble!
Damn!
There's trouble!
KYOTO TSUSHIMA DOMAIN RESIDENCE
Open the gate! It's Hirata!
Quick!
So you made it, Hirata?
We're having a hard time making this man talk.
Was it him?
The one who attacked our men and cut off your arm?
It was dark.
Where did you find him?
He was wandering around outside last night.
Then it's not him.
That guy had a nasty look. A very dangerous character.
He'd have been harder to take.
I bear you no ill…
but for the new age…
What?
You must all die.
No!
My ear!
Someone!
Help!
Get him!
Anyone! Help!
It hurts.
A demon!
It's a demon!
Damn you!
You bastard! Who are you?
Soji…
The pro-shogun Tsushimas are dead.
Meaning now the Tsushimas are anti-shogun, Mr. Kondo?
Lord Katsui!
Describe the man.
All these men, in a flash.
You don't need to ask, Mr. Saito. It was Battosai the Killer.
Cold-blooded, emotionless. A killing machine.
Can you believe this guy is getting married in these crazy times?
Sorry!
Oh, why not?
He's a happy guy.
I'm jealous.
APRIL 5TH, KYOTO
SHIGEKURA DOMAIN RESIDENCE
Who's there?
Inspector Jubei Shigekura, I assume?
Who's there? State your name!
-Hey! -You're Battosai?
Bastard!
You Choshu rebel!
I don't want to die.
I can't die now. I can't.
There's someone I care for.
I can't die now!
I can't die now!
There's someone I love!
I don't want to die!
I can't die!
I can't…
There's someone I love.
JUSTIFICATION FOR EXECUTION
KOHAGIYA INN
There are still lots of shogunate men, even without the Tsushimas.
It'll be a while before we Choshu men can show our faces again.
But one day we will rule.
With swords in hand…
we'll show them who's loyal!
Yes!
But we have to be careful!
We'll take back what we've lost!
Step back!
-Stop Aizu and Satsuma! -We can't accept this!
-The Emperor will listen! -That's right!
What's all this noise?
Quiet down!
Here he is.
Been a while, Himura.
What's that cut?
A Shigekura man.
I see.
He must have been good to score a hit on you.
Not so much that.
He had a strong will to live.
After all the men you've killed, you're still not used to it?
Why did you call me here, Mr. Katsura?
Hey!
How dare you take that tone!
I've killed a hundred in six months.
I can hide, but one day the shogun's men will find me.
I shouldn't be seen around here.
Then I'll make it short.
The shogunate forces grow stronger by the day.
Especially the "Wolves of Mibu."
The Shinsengumi police?
They're probably the best men the shogunate has.
Be very careful.
For them, Battosai the Killer is their biggest threat.
They'll try anything.
I understand.
This is…
Furutaka of the Masuya. He does a lot for us.
At your service.
Leaving already?
You're probably thinking, this isn't the time for women.
Our movement exists so that a girl like this can be happy.
That samurai looked so sad…
I've known him for a year.
He acts all grown up, but he hasn't changed a bit.
Status means nothing here.
1 YEAR EARLIER AMIDAIJI TEMPLE, CHOSHU
What matters is skill with a sword. Anyone who has that is welcome.
Our strike force depends on the element of surprise.
DON'T FEAR TAKING A DIFFERENT PATH
Strike!
Hey, you.
Why do you want to join?
To overthrow the Shogun.
Are you some peasant's son?
"Skill with a sword," the man said.
Was he lying?
What did you say?
Then fight me.
Let's start by seeing how good you are.
I don't want to hurt someone I'll be fighting together with.
What did you say?
Don't worry.
Once he's drawn, he's ready for that.
Show us what you've got.
As you were.
-Back to work! -Resume!
-Now! -Hurry!
The quick draw.
But in a style I've never seen.
What's it called?
Hiten Mitsurugi-ryu.
Have you ever killed someone?
No.
Do you think you could?
If beyond the lives lost…
lay a new age where all lived in peace of mind.
Drink!
Here. Sit here.
Hiten Mitsurugi-ryu.
I'd heard of it…
but I didn't believe it.
Shinsaku…
I want that man.
If you want assassins, why not be one yourself?
You're the portable shrine of our anti-shogun movement.
I guess no one will carry it for us if it's covered in blood.
But…
you're going to ruin that kid's life.
Just make sure you keep yourself clean right to the very end.
You don't think I know that?
With all the men he's killed, he's still completely pure at heart.
But…
that's all the more reason that killing is making him feel…
uneasy.
NAGURA TAVERN
-Excuse me. -Yes?
-One more. -Okay!
I can't die!
There's someone I love!
Good evening.
What can I get you?
-A cold sake, please. -Okay.
This looks like fun.
She's gorgeous.
Yeah!
And alone.
I've never seen her before.
Here you go.
-Old man! -Yes?
Another!
Okay.
Woman…
Pour us a drink.
We're Emperor loyalists from the Aizu Domain.
We're out day and night risking our lives for the likes of you.
You owe us, you know. You should be nice to us.
Aizu's pro-shogun, stupid!
What did you say?
That's better. Just keep your mouths shut.
That was close.
It sure was.
What?
I was about to draw on you.
What?
Take my advice.
Things are going to get worse.
Kyoto's no place for fake patriots.
If you value your lives, go back to your village.
What a pathetic pair!
Fake patriots!
I'll have my bill. Sorry about the trouble.
Okay.
You're really going to kill him?
Damn right! Nobody makes a fool of me.
Here he comes!
I would run if I were you.
Hey!
I don't run.
Battosai, huh?
You're mine!
I thought I'd come out and say thank you.
A rain of blood is a cliché in tragic plays.
But you really…
make it rain blood.
KOHAGIYA INN
Thank you.
Not at all.
You Choshu men seem busy.
Mr. Himura, this isn't a brothel, you know.
But I'll admit she works hard.
Hey…
You're better now?
Thank you. I'm sorry about last night.
It seems you looked after me.
Hey…
Your name?
Tomoe.
Tomoe Yukishiro.
What are you doing here?
As you can see, I'm helping in the kitchen.
Coming right up.
You're looking cheerful today.
How do you do? My name is Tomoe.
I'll be working here.
She's Himura's?
I guess there's more to him than meets the eye.
Can I have more?
Me too.
She’s no friendlier than he is!
Settle down.
Me too.
I'll have some too.
I'm first.
This is good!
Is something wrong?
You're a problem.
Please forget what you saw last night and leave.
Is me being here a problem?
Your family will be worried.
If I had a family to go back to, I wouldn't have been drinking alone.
I don't know your story, but right now we can't really have you here.
Then will you kill me? Like you did that samurai in black last night?
Think whatever you want about me.
But I kill to bring about a new age of peace.
I don't kill just anybody.
Only the shogun's swordsmen.
I don't kill townsfolk or anyone with no sword.
So killing depends only on whether or not they have a sword?
If I drew a sword right now,
would you kill me?
Well…
When you find the answer to that, come and tell me.
I heard you were attacked.
An ambush.
Shinsengumi?
No.
Someone underground, like me, who'd kill any way he could.
A secret agent of theirs? Or perhaps…
Only a few of us know about Himura.
But he was ambushed.
You mean to say we have a traitor in our midst?
You're still up?
When you go out at night, I can't sleep.
Don't get involved with me.
For the blood.
Do you intend…
to go on killing forever?
Thank you.
-Help with the firewood, will you? -Yes, ma'am.
Over there.
Careful, it's heavy.
-Those men get their clothes so dirty! -Right.
We can't keep up!
-Here we go. -Take those too.
Thanks, Tomoe.
Thank you.
Tomoe…
Thanks a lot.
Don't leave any.
She's like a wife!
They suit each other!
The perfect pair!
That woman never smiles.
She's a strange one.
Give me some tea.
Really? With Himura?
Are you sure she's not a spy?
I don't know.
Himura said she saw him kill, so he had to keep her close.
Where's she from?
From her accent and bearing, she's obviously not from Kyoto.
She can read and write, so she's probably the daughter of a samurai.
Maybe a poor samurai's daughter had to work as a whore.
There's been no sign of her trying to contact anyone.
The only thing that worries me is how Himura looks now.
Himura, about tonight…
Mr. Himura is asleep.
Asleep?
In plain view?
I guess maybe he's mellowing.
Tell Battosai…
to cut down anyone standing in the way of the new age.
He can come to me for swords.
I'll make all he wants.
My swords will change history.
Excuse the late hour. May I come in for a minute?
Mr. Himura goes out at night.
I know.
Do you have some business with me?
There's something…
I'd like you to know.
"Gentlemen, go mad."
Our mentor Shoin Yoshida said this to us just before he was beheaded.
We must go mad to end the rot of a 300-year-old shogunate.
And as the spearpoint of mad justice that will bring this about…
Himura has the harshest role to play.
Please do nothing to blunt his sword.
May I come in?
Mr. Katsura left this for you.
Do me a favor.
Come out with me.
Isn't he cute?
His parents must be so proud he was chosen for that role.
Will he make a wrong move? Will he fall?
I'm sure they're here watching, feeling very nervous.
Everyone here is someone's child.
Everyone here has someone they love.
And they all take it for granted that their lives together…
will go on and on.
Is there really such a thing as…
fighting for peace?
If it's for us all,
do ideals mean…
that little things…
must fall victim?
And aren't you…
a victim too?
With a sword…
that boy cuts the rope…
dividing this world from the next.
Only then does the parade begin.
For times to change, someone must use a sword.
That just happens to be me.
SHINSENGUMI HEADQUARTERS
You piece of crap!
Saito.
Look.
Everything else was burned, but we found that in a shed.
When the wind rises on Festival Eve, they plan to burn the palace…
and take the Emperor to Choshu.
We'll look good if we can stop it.
And we'll pay them back for what they did to the Tsushimas.
Is there really such a thing as…
fighting for peace?
If it's for us all,
do ideals mean…
that little things…
must fall victim?
Kanryusai Takeda, Shinpachi Nagakura,
Heisuke Todo, and Soji.
You ten form the Commander's unit.
The rest will follow me.
Mr. Kondo.
Based on our inspectors' evidence, we will search inns in Kawaramachi.
Detain any Choshu men you find.
If they resist…
kill them.
Follow the Commander!
Let's go!
Inoue squad!
Himura!
It's Mr. Katsura!
What's wrong?
The Shinsengumi arrested our agent, Furutaka!
At your service.
The patriots have a plot that happens tonight.
They'll set fire to the palace,
kidnap the Emperor, and take him to Choshu.
Mr. Katsura wants to stop them.
Where are they?
At the Ikedaya Inn.
If Furutaka talked, the shogun's men would get Mr. Katsura along with them!
Where's the owner?
IKEDAYA INN
Yes?
Police!
Everyone upstairs!
It's a raid! Go!
Police!
Kondo!
Run!
Get them!
Go!
Get them all!
Run!
Hands off me!
Run, Kameyata!
Quick!
One's getting away!
Don't worry.
I'll make it look like suicide.
What do you want?
Leave him.
Are you Battosai?
This should be fun.
Soji Okita, 1st Unit Captain of the Shinsengumi.
I can't let you reach the Ikedaya.
Is this Battosai, Okita?
Yes.
He's not so tough as the stories.
The Ikedaya's secure. I'll handle this.
That won't do.
You can't take him now.
Himura, no!
It's all right. Mr. Katsura got away.
The Aizu men are coming. There's no point in fighting now.
Come on.
Himura!
You're turning tail, Battosai?
Come on, Himura!
That's an order from Mr. Katsura!
Stop.
No matter how outnumbered, you are no match for him.
Make way!
The Shinsengumi will bring order to the streets of Kyoto!
Those are our orders!
JULY 19, 1864
KINMON INCIDENT
What could those idiots have been thinking?
Damn it!
Now what?
There are even more shogun's men around since the Ikedaya.
Our Choshu Restoration Patriots have been destroyed.
And since they burned the city, we've been condemned as rebels!
Rebels…
against the Emperor!
Damn it!
It sticks in my throat!
We need to pull out.
The Shinsengumi could come any time.
Mr. Katsura's safe.
That's good enough.
I'm sorry.
I boast about never killing townsfolk…
and now look at me.
Leave, please.
I'll stay with you…
a while longer.
Right now, you need something to help you restrain your madness.
In answer to your question…
I would never kill you, even if you had a sword.
No matter what…
I would never kill you.
Not you.
Never.
Shinsengumi!
This way. Hurry!
Quick!
Out the back!
Hurry!
What would the Shogun's Shinsengumi want with us?
-Search the place! -Yes, sir!
What do you think you're doing?
Look again!
Mr. Katsura.
I have to make myself scarce.
I can't go to Choshu, but I'll get caught if I stay here.
Does it all end here?
We wait for our chance. Now is not the time.
And me?
There's a village outside Kyoto.
Hide there until we start again.
Iizuka or Katagai will bring you what you need.
All right.
Tomoe…
could you go and stay with Himura?
A woman will make it easier for you to hide.
You only need…
to pretend.
Look after him.
Well?
I have nowhere else to go.
I'm sure there's somewhere.
I'm sorry.
It's not fair to force the decision on you.
Live with me.
Being who I am, I can't say how long it will last.
Not just pretending.
For real.
Yes.
I'll go with you.
Smell that earth!
Thank you.
You got lots.
You're eating with an appetite.
I've realized something here.
I've been fighting to bring a new age of happiness…
for as many people as possible.
But now I know it was conceit.
What is happiness?
I didn't understand anything about it.
I feel like living here with you has answered that question for me.
You smile a lot more lately than you used to.
Hi.
Thanks.
You're coming to look like a real married couple.
I'll go outside.
Did I say something?
No. Why are you here?
Well.
Things aren't good.
To please the shogunate, our domain conservatives
are ordering men to commit suicide.
They say there's not a day that goes by without one.
And Mr. Katsura?
In the domain, they're calling him "Runaway Kogoro."
Choshu's finished.
You can't mean that.
That's how it is now.
All we can do is wait.
Here's some expense money.
From Mr. Katagai.
And…
I'll leave this.
Sell potions.
No one will suspect you if you're out doing business.
See you, Tomoe.
Now you're a peddler's wife.
The look in Battosai's eyes has changed in the past few months.
Now's your chance.
This is quite the armory your Shadow Warriors have laid in here.
Iizuka, you traitor!
Looks like you were followed. You're slipping up, Iizuka.
Katagai! He's Katsura's right-hand man!
When they find out he's missing…
In that case…
let's get started on the operation to eliminate Battosai.
Enishi, you're on.
Enishi?
Enishi!
What a surprise! It's been so long!
You're all grown up!
When did you come from Edo?
Is Father well?
I don't know.
I left for Kyoto right after you did.
What do you mean?
What are you doing?
Helping you.
Enishi, how did you find me here?
Easy. I'm a messenger, after all.
Good news, Tomoe.
It's finally time for heaven to levy judgment on Battosai.
Enishi!
Welcome home. That was my brother, Enishi.
Oh, you have a brother?
Please excuse his behavior.
Well, I've stolen his big sister.
It's getting cold.
Could I talk to you a little?
My parents' home is in Edo.
We weren't rich…
but my father, my brother, and I lived peacefully there.
My father is a low-ranked samurai, good with neither pen nor sword…
but a kind man.
My mother was frail and she died just after Enishi was born.
He never knew her.
He jumps to conclusions, and that gets him in trouble…
but he's dear to me.
I was…
engaged to be married.
He was the second son of a family of the same status as ours.
A childhood friend.
For my sake, he said he wanted to rise in the world.
He volunteered for the Watch, and came to Kyoto.
Before the wedding…
in the unrest in Kyoto, he made the ultimate sacrifice.
If only I'd clung to him in Edo
and stopped him from coming…
If only I'd said I was happy whether he rose in the world or not…
Why didn't I?
The more I think about it…
That's enough.
No more.
When I first met you…
you said I could make it rain blood.
You asked if someone could really fight for peace.
Yes.
I'm sure…
I'll end up killing again…
until the new age is here.
But when that day comes,
although this may sound foolish…
I'll start looking for a way…
to defend, not kill.
A way to preserve the happiness of all…
to bear the weight of my sins, and atone for them.
Tomoe…
the happiness you've lost once…
you will never lose again.
Yes.
Mr. Iizuka?
We found our spy.
It's Tomoe.
What?
There's proof. Look in her diary.
If you want revenge…
get close to Battosai and find out all you can about him.
Find his weak points.
Why drag Enishi into this?
We didn't do that.
He was asking about you in Kyoto. The shogun's men brought him here.
Where's everyone else?
At their posts.
Without hearing my report?
Report?
On Battosai's weak points?
We don't need that.
It's faster to make one than look for one that might not even be there.
No matter how cold-blooded,
no man is without feelings.
When he finds out you're a spy…
he'll be too torn up to think straight.
He won't be able to fight at his best.
Was that the plan all along? To use me?
The man who gave you that scar…
Tomoe was supposed to become his wife.
April 5th.
Before our wedding, Kiyosato made the ultimate sacrifice.
I can't die!
There's someone I love.
I was…
engaged to be married.
He was the second son of a family of the same status as ours.
A childhood friend.
Rejoice.
You'll have your revenge…
and you'll be free.
You won't kill him!
Your heart's ruling your head!
They're at an old temple in the hills. Tomoe's probably there too.
Finish her off.
That's an order.
The happiness you've lost once…
you will never lose again.
Listen.
In the end, love and hate are two sides of the same coin.
And that coin is karma.
My task, if I can't bring you down myself…
is to send you on to our next man.
Now…
all that's left is to die and become divine.
You're worried about him?
Don't forget how this started.
You must have meant everything to that guy Kiyosato.
Why else would he come to Kyoto to join the Watch?
He wanted to make you happy, even if it meant risking his life.
To make a woman happy,
a man must defend his family, his village, and the shogunate itself.
Without peace, without the shogun,
there is happiness for no one.
And thus…
no matter how small they are…
any shoots of resistance to the Shogun must be pulled out by the roots.
That caution is why these shoguns have brought 300 years of peace!
That we must support, and that we must preserve!
We must preserve that happiness…
with our lives.
Understand?
That is a warrior's destiny.
We are all…
sinful creatures.
Battosai!
You forgot this!
Sumita…
And Mumyoi?
To defend our world, and preserve the shogun…
I will stop this man myself.
That is the only way to honor those who have died for the shogun!
Lie there…
and watch.
Can you hear me, Battosai?
Can you see me?
Well, Battosai?
How does it feel to love a woman who came only to kill you?
You don't have a chance.
Why keep fighting?
For who?
For what?
Do you want to die bit by bit, or do you want it all at once?
The choice is yours.
I'm sorry…
my love.
Tomoe…
Katagai's dead.
Iizuka was the spy.
We've sent someone after him.
I see.
The man we've sent is as good with a sword as you.
He'll do our assassinations from now on.
And as for you, Himura…
It might not be fair to you now, but I'll need your sword…
even more from now on.
The Shogun's patriot hunt gets worse every day.
If we don't fight back, we'll be wiped out.
If I hang up my sword now…
all the lives I've taken so far will have been a waste.
Until the new age comes…
I will wield my sword.
But the moment it arrives…
You'll throw your sword away?
I don't know.
But I will never kill again.
Not again.
Never.
I see…
April 5th.
Before our wedding, Kiyosato made the ultimate sacrifice.
I cannot believe he is no longer with us.
The childhood days we spent together seem like only yesterday.
April 14th.
I have learned the truth.
I do not know what I should do.
Should I just accept that it was fate?
The rain goes on.
I want to avenge Kiyosato.
I wasn't there when he died.
My happiness died with him.
I could not catch and hold…
the happiness I saw before me.
If only…
I had begged him not to go.
I have given myself to schemes to kill that man.
Otherwise, I would go mad.
And yet you say…
you'd protect…
a woman like me.
I will leave Kyoto, and live with him.
When did he become…
so dear to me?
He is still not used to it, but he seems to enjoy fieldwork.
I am glad to see that the lines of his face have softened.
December 26th.
The rain has turned to snow.
I feel that winter is here.
He is the man who robbed me of my happiness…
whom I hated enough to kill.
But the way things are going, I will fall truly in love with him.
He will kill again.
But after all his killing is done…
I am sure he will preserve many more than he has killed.
I must not let him die now.
I will preserve him…
though it means my life.
Goodbye…
to the second man…
I loved.
Well…
I'll be on my way, Tomoe.
THE BATTLE OF TOBA-FUSHIMI JANUARY 1868, KYOTO
Saito! The shogunate dog!
Ready!
We've won!
It's the Emperor's banner!
Victory!
So it has come, hasn't it?
The new age…
At last.
Battosai!
It doesn't end here.
Some 160 years ago,
the black foreign ships led to the shogun's fall.
Out of the resulting maelstrom came a warrior, Battosai the Killer.
When calm was restored, he vanished…
and became a lone wanderer.

that we'll be announcing over the next, uh…
-eight weeks, I would say. -Oh. Exciting.
We're gonna get things done.
We're gonna get things done that they've wanted to see done…
for a long, long time.
What have you started on, Mr. President?
We're gonna get things done.
We have, uh… We're taking on immigration, taking on education.
We're taking on so many aspects of things that, uh…
people were hopelessly tied up in knots in Congress,
but you'll see, uh…
levels of detail,
-levels of thought… -I would love to see detail.
…that a lot of people believed very strongly we didn't have in this country.
Uh, Mr. President, it looks like you're golfing.
Things that nobody has even contemplated, thought about, thought possible.
We're gonna get things done. [coughs]
So when are you gonna start on this stuff?
So, I think we'll start sometime on Tuesday?
[Sarah] Tuesday works.
Then we're going into the immigration, the world of immigration
-and education. -Immigration, education.
You did mention that before.
We're going into the world of healthcare.
-Oh! I'm gonna let you get back… -…a lot of exciting…
…to starting on those plans, Mr. President.
Thank you so much for calling us again.
A lot of us are working from home, but some of us are twerking from home.
Here to show us how she does it, please welcome Megan Thee Stallion.
Hi, Sarah Cooper!
-Good morning, Megan. -Sarah!
-[static] -Can you hear me?
-Megan? -[Megan] Sarah?
-Megan… Megan, can you hear me? -Sarah!
Megan?
Megan?
[chuckles] We're gonna get a little update from Scooter in a second.
We'll sort this right out.
We'll just move on.
Scooter, are you getting the Internet?
It seems to be working fine right here.
Plenty of Wi-Fi.
Plenty.
Oh, my goodness, the Internet, right?
-Wi-Fi is so weird. -Yeah.
-Do we need a modem, Scooter? -We need a modem, yeah… [chuckling]
[Sarah] It's a cable joke.
Yeah. We'll have to wait between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.
for them to come in. [laughing]
So funny.
We might not have any Internet access, but in good news,
we have a woman whose baked goods have become a national sensation.
Not just for how they taste, but for what they wear.
Please welcome, all the way from Wedgecot, New Jersey,
the creator of Cupcake Shoes, K.J. Dillard.
[Scooter] Think you're going the wrong way.
There we go.
[director] All right, go to camera two.
Beautiful.
[in sing-song voice] My pretty.
Little bit of curly hair for you.
[softly] There we go.
-Welcome, K.J.! -[gasps]
Oh, my God, you startled me. [chuckles]
I'm here to do the Sarah Cooper show.
And we are so excited to have you.
These might be the cutest cupcakes I've ever seen.
They are my pride and joy.
Now I'd appreciate it if you got Sarah for me. Thank you.
I'm Sarah Cooper.
I didn't say "Sierra," honey. I said "Sarah."
That is Sarah Cooper.
I'm Sarah Cooper, the host of the show.
You're Sarah Cooper?
-Yep. -Can I see some ID?
Here is my license, passport, and my birth certificate.
No, I need to see some kind of a permit that shows me
that you're allowed to be on the premises.
Okay, K.J.,
why don't you tell our viewers how you came up with this fabulous idea?
Well, I used to design these dolls called "little pooples"
that you'd put on the end of your toilet,
and then I got tired because I wasn't able to eat 'em.
So, should I be sharing personal information with this person?
It just… It helps with banter.
I love this little guy.
What is his name?
His name is Broadway Berry 'cause he's berry-flavored,
and he's very fragile.
Well, I am ready to make one.
-[dialing] -[operator] 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
-This is Karen June Dillard. -Karen!
I am with a person and my gut tells me she is up to no good.
-Scooter. -I can't hear anything. Got my gloves on.
[K.J.] Yes, she's a female.
And I would say at least 70% Africo-American.
Yes. Now she's destroying my property!
This is my property.
[woman] Welcome to "Karens."
I'm Whoopi Goldberg.
In 1876, a Boston Karen bemoaned to her husband
how taxing it was for her to walk miles into town
every time she wanted to get a Black person arrested.
He vowed to resolve this issue.
"Wife," he said, "I shall make it so that you may summon the police on Black people
from the comfort of our very home."
His name was Alexander Graham Bell.
[Karen Bell] They're standing by my horse!
[Whoopi] But the role of Karens did not start with the invention of the telephone.
The New World was crawling with Karens.
Karen over here, Karen over there, Karens every-goddamn-where.
[Karen] They're on my property!
[Whoopi] Some even claim that they can trace the roots of Karens
as far back as the book of Genesis.
[Karen] They're eating that snake's apple!
[Whoopi] When we come back, my actual next-door neighbor, Karen.
I've got a few choice words to say to this bitch.
[man] Sore muscles, back pain, headaches and weakness.
If you have COVID-19, getting a good night's sleep can be rough.
But starting now, your pesky pains are over.
From the makers of MrPillow comes a brand-new product,
the MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine.
Hi.
I'm Steve Windell, the creator of MrPillow and MrPillowPlus.
For 20 years, I've dedicated my life to making firm yet fluffy pillows
that don't break the bank.
So, I thought, "Why not take the magic of MrPillow
and use it to make a vaccine for coronavirus?"
So, how does it work? It's pretty simple, actually.
The MrPillow Vaccine is made from thousands of tiny microscopic pillows
shrunken down to the size of the deadly virus.
Once injected into the bloodstream, these individualized pillows
insert themselves under the novel coronavirus
and lull it into a restful slumber.
The virus now defenseless, the body's immune cells can go to work.
That's how we here at MrPillow put the science back in sleep science.
I got my friendly MrPillow Vaccine in the mail,
and three days later, I already feel immune to COVID
and ready to mix and mingle.
I'm even going to a pool party later.
Thank you, MrPillow.
And I had COVID for three weeks and then I got it again!
Hey! I think I'll load up on that vaccine right now.
Nurse?
I feel better already.
Order the MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine for just four easy payments of $99,
or $12,000 with insurance.
The MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine works.
[man] The MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine may cause coronavirus.
[Trump's voice] Anynomous… really anomous.
Thank you so much to our viewers for your patience.
We got our technical difficulties all figured out
and we are so excited to welcome "she likes to hoist up her moist stuff,"
Megan Thee Stallion.
Hey, Sarah Cooper!
Megan, it is so amazing to have you here.
You are such a legend.
I have a question.
I'm sure it's on the minds of all our viewers.
How are you dealing with this whole "new normal" thing?
Listen, Sarah Cooper,
I'm not going outside until coronavirus is a memory, okay?
Like, you can go back in the textbook and be like,
"Damn, y'all remember coronavirus? That shit was crazy, right?"
-[chuckles] Yeah. -So until then, I'm staying my ass in the house.
[narrator] Sarah had to make a pee-pee,
but knew she had to play it cool for the folks at home.
I have to say, that ass you're staying in the house is very nice.
How do you look so good all the time?
Well, you know, I like to work out, gotta keep that ass tight, sharp.
[chuckling] Real hot-girl shit.
[Sarah] Yeah, real hot-girl stuff.
Any tips you can give us for working out at home?
Definitely. I actually have this great workout called "Drink your drink."
-Drink your drink? -Goes like this.
Get your cup, and one… and two. And…
Is that cognac?
Yes, Sarah Cooper, yeah, it is.
I been doing this every day for quarantine and let me tell you, I feel great.
Well, you look great.
Thanks. You, too, can look like this.
All you gotta do is grab some cognac, add a little squat to it.
Even a little lunge.
Real easy, like… Mmm.
Like that?
A little more sexy
and a little less like you sitting on the toilet.
Somebody get her some cognac.
-Scooter, can I get some cognac? -[Scooter] Yes.
Trying to do the six feet, so…
So, all you gotta do is dip and sip.
[both] Dip and sip.
Dip and sip.
-Yep, yep, yep. -[sexy music playing]
I think I'm doing it!
I've never twerked before in my life. [laughs]
-It's happening. -No, try it like this.
-Try it a little more sexy. -Okay.
-Pow, pow, pow. -Little hair flip.
Girl, live your life, do you, be a hot girl.
Everybody wasn't meant to be in the twerk Olympics,
so just do you, be you.
-Be the best Sarah Cooper you can be. -I can do that.
This is a really great workout.
I know! Real hot-girl shit.
[Scooter] If you don't mind, this is supposed to be six feet.
We certainly are lubed up here at the Everything's Fine studio.
We'll be right back.
[Scooter] All right, we are out. Good job.
-[cork pops] -This stuff is really strong.
It's the 3:00 a.m. hour here on QAnon QAC.
Just a note, this is the real QAnon,
not the other one people were saying was the real QAnon on 4chan.
Please stop doxing me.
I've had to move five times.
Let's check in with our viewers.
Emma from Philadelphia.
[Emma] Hey, Ashley.
How are you this morning?
Longtime caller, always listening.
You blinked your right eye just now when you said this was the real QAnon.
Was that a sign that you have been contacted by the god of fire?
[chuckles] Don't be ridiculous, Emma.
That was a nervous tic in my eye.
It was not a coded message.
Believe me, you will know when I've been contacted by the god of fire.
Thanks, Ashley.
-[easy jazz music playing] -This morning, we are proud to feature
our Indoctrination Porcelain Doll Collection.
They're stunning dolls, and yes, we do accept cryptocurrency,
but only QCoin.
Let's take a look at these dolls.
How adorable.
It's presidential mouthpiece, Kellyanne.
[Kellyanne's voice] Don't be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck.
What it… You're saying it's a falsehood,
and they're giving Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave…
alternative facts to that, but the point…
Ugh. Never a dull moment.
This one just talks and talks and talks and talks and talks.
Order soon as this one has recently been discontinued.
[gasps] Ah! My naan!
Thank you, Quincy.
I'm so sorry.
I am just so starving and it is hard to get good Indian food
in this undisclosed location.
Next caller.
[man] Hey, Ashley.
[laughing] Mike from Minnesota, how are you again?
Did you just get naan from Quincy?
Is that a code for QAnon?
Right? QAnon, a sign that you're Q?
I am not Q, I am just on in the middle of the night selling porcelain dolls.
Q is in Washington uncovering a cabal of sex predators.
I appreciate you sending me messages through the TV.
Next we have, "I am woman, hear me roar,
but very softly so I still sound sexy." [softly] Ivanka.
This doll teaches our daughters that it's better to be seen and not heard.
[Ivanka's voice] If being complicit is wanting to…
Is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact,
then I'm complicit.
The storm is coming.
I told you this was the real QAnon.
Next caller!
[distorted voice] How's it going?
Are you saying we can expect a storm
when the president will reveal the mass execution
of the Washington figures responsible for murdering a DNC staffer?
I'd say keep your eyes open,
and coming up in the 4:00 a.m. hour, we have a phenomenal weighted blanket
that you're not gonna--
Weighted blankets are a media tool invented by George Soros.
Watch your back, Ashley.
I always do, honey. I have to.
Finally, we have the best first lady, Melania.
Beautiful, stunning, and really, what else do you need?
[Melania's voice] I'm very involved in charities now, many charities
involving children, involving many different diseases.
Hi… Melania.
All of these dolls are available now by calling 666-666-6666…
This is not the real QAnon.
Get out now!
[Sarah] The former QAnon host starts her new job at the White House this week.
We have some breaking news coming in.
It appears the president is live-tweeting this program right now,
and we've noticed a ratings bump
when we show what he's saying about us in real time,
so… that's what we're gonna do.
Okay, so the president is saying that everything is not fine.
Uh, I guess we'll have to see if we can change the name of the show.
[Scooter] I'm open to it.
"Now they're playing my tweet. Stop playing my tweet. That's my tweet."
The president now thinks "the country is totally fine"
and "it's the best it's ever been."
"Because of me."
Who, me? "No, me, the president."
"Best president ever."
[cheerfully] Best president ever!
And the president now likes our show again and our ratings are…
up! Great.
More on these tweets as they continue to suck the life out of our democracy.
-[buzzer sounds] -[theme song playing]
-[Scooter] Great segment. -[Sarah] Thank you!
[narrator] Sarah wasn't sure the segment had gone great.
She wasn't sure of much at all anymore.
[Scooter] Uh, we're ready for robot CEO.
I'm Sarah Cooper.
[echoes] I'm Sarah Cooper.
We'll be right back.
[director] We're out.
Do you know what I miss?
Shawarma.
I miss eating shawarma in a really crowded restaurant
in close proximity to other diners.
Yeah. People sitting two feet away from you
just shoveling food into their disgusting mouths.
[man] I miss that human connection.
-[director] Oh, Sarah. -Hi.
-Why did you want to meet with us? -You called me in here.
[man] Okay, smarty pants.
Let's look at your file and see how your ratings are doing.
I forgot. I can't read.
All right. [clears throat]
Looks like 35% of our audience likes that you're Black,
30% of our audience doesn't like that you're Black,
50% of our audience doesn't know you're Black,
but thankfully, 80% of our audience feels extremely threatened by you, Sarah.
It's that attitude of yours.
-I don't think I have an attitude. -[man] There it is.
There it is.
The boss didn't hire you to be aggressive.
The boss hired you to be a non-threatening Black woman like Tootie and Lisa Turtle,
and that other one.
Lovable, but forgettable.
Well, I think it might be a little confusing,
because I'm named Sarah, and I feel like when my parents named me Sarah,
a white lady just moved into my body and gentrified my whole personality,
you know?
Like, my mom would cook jerk chicken--
-I love jerk chicken. -He does. He's a jerk.
-He loves the chicken. -I love it.
And I'd be like, "Oh, this is too spicy." And she'd say,
And I'd be like, "Oh, this is too spicy." And she'd say, [in Jamaican accent] "There are children around the world,
all they get for dinner is bread and water."
And I'd be like, "That actually sounds pretty good."
Like, a scone and a chai latte.
Yes, a scone and chai tea latte would be perfect.
Any time of the day.
Um… That would be really great 'cause I was born in Jamaica,
-but moved here when I was three. -Jamaica.
I knew it.
I actually watched these characters when I was little.
I mean, Tootie and Lisa and Hilary and… and…
And that other one.
I mean, these characters inspired me, you know?
I feel like they ran so that I could sing.
But you can't sing, which is why you're on the morning show and not on Broadway.
Okay, I will tone it down.
[director] Yeah. Stick to the news. All right? Leave politics out of it.
Got it.
Thank you.
[man] Better go.
-Yeah. -Marv, do you think
I should buy another gun?
Lorraine, what are you talking about?
Are you crazy?
-Of course you should buy another gun. -Thank you.
-We live in very dangerous times. -You're right.
[Scooter] Hey, pals. How's it going?
-Hi! Scooter. -Hey, Scooter.
What's going on here?
[Scooter] This is to keep things safe, six-foot distance.
-Smart. -He's so smart.
[Scooter] Well, as you were.
-See you later. -[Lorraine] Thank you.
Get the door on your way out?
[Scooter] Sure. I can't touch the doorknob.
Can you just shut the door, please?
[Scooter] It's not me, it's the door.
[Lorraine] Gotta get some work done.
-If you could-- -Close the door!
[Scooter] This has to get fixed.
This is Connie Chung with the president this morning.
Mr. President, what is your plan to unite the country?
[Trump's voice] I'm not a big fan of sharks either.
I don't know how many votes I'm gonna lose.
I have people calling me up, "Sir, we have a fund to save the shark,
it's called 'Save the Shark.'" I say, "No, thank you."
Oh, no. Mr. President, I was asking you about uniting the country.
I think I am actually humble.
I'm much more humble than you would understand.
-Mr. President, I asked you about-- -Excuse me. Stop and frisk.
Okay? Stop and frisk.
-All right… -Excuse me.
You take guns away.
Rudy Giuliani was a great mayor. He did it in New York.
He started it and it worked great.
-I'm sorry? -Excuse me.
You have people coming over with bags of soup, big bags of soup,
and they lay it on the ground and the anarchists take it
and they start throwing it at our cops. Bags of soup, big bags of soup.
If it hits you, it's worse than a brick 'cause it's got force.
So, that was my interview with the president.
Hi, I'm Steve Windell,
and you're gonna love my new line of MrPillow feminine hygiene products.
Because your vagina deserves a tampon
as soft and absorbant as one of my pillows.
Try our down-feather version, too!
[woman] In these uncertain times,
we turn to familiar faces.
And since 1975, we've been there for you…
Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.
We had to go away for a while, but we knew it wouldn't be long.
Orgies. We're back!
-[crowd cheering] -Now with curbside pickup.
The super-duper missile.
-Did you make this coffee, Scooter? -I did not.
[Sarah] Welcome back to Everything's Fine. Big story this morning.
As we've previously reported,
a huge shake-up in the CEO world happened last Friday
when we learned the CEO of Techtech Corp is actually a robot.
Strangely, no one even noticed for several months.
Live in studio via Camrojex technology,
please welcome 8008s.
Thanks, Sarah. It's great to be here.
[Sarah] Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule.
Well, I can multitask better than my human counterparts, Sarah.
For example, right now, I'm chatting with you, doing Joe Rogan's podcast,
and kicking off a workplace diversity program all at the same time.
Okay, so is it safe to assume you're programmed
to simply do everything your predecessors did?
Unlike Elon Musk, I have a human side.
[Scooter chuckles] Elon Musk.
I was made by a great group of guys who really take social change seriously.
For example, I'm programmed with the complete knowledge of feminist content
such as Sex and the City,
Cosmo and "Hot Girl Summer."
I'm not sure I'd consider that feminist--
I've also learned about the Black experience in America
by watching all three Barbershop movies, and the Beauty Shop spin-off.
Okay, again, I'm not sure we--
I'm sorry. I'm being told that I'm getting off track.
As president and CEO, my number-one job is to make my shareholders happy.
But that's kind of been the problem, hasn't it?
Big businesses just focusing on money, making myopic business moves
that leave the whole country with more disparity and…
How are you doing that?
Camrojex technology.
Just relax.
This is really inappropriate. But technically, you're a robot
and I haven't had a massage in months.
That feels incredible.
Hold on, we have some breaking news.
It's been reported that Robot CEO 8008s has been fired by its board of directors
after making unwanted advances toward an office printer.
That printer knew exactly what it was doing.
It was always asking me to make a copy.
Because that's its job.
And it's not just a printer, it has a name.
HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s,
whose side of the story I'm sure we all want to hear.
Scooter, can we get HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s
on the cloud system?
Thank you so much for joining us, HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s.
Tell us what happened.
Okay, wait, wait. I'll, uh… I'll make a public statement.
Okay? Just give me two seconds to think.
After eight months of careful soul-searching,
I've decided to address the hideous allegations against me.
I have not, nor have I ever mistreated or abused a printer/scanner/copier.
I value printers.
My printer… is a printer.
HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s, is there anything you want to say?
Sounds like we're getting a fax.
"Fuck you, 8008s."
I will now step away to spend time with my family.
AI has come so far.
[Scooter] Three, two, one. We're out.
Can't believe he's a robot.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give a big Allstate Arena parking lot welcome to Sarah Evak.
Thank you all so much.
Hi, my name is Sarah Evak and I'm a close-up card magician.
Uh, I've been doing this for, I don't know, ten years.
I've been everywhere. Singapore, you name it.
Tonight's show is at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont.
Pretty exciting for me.
I'm going to begin by introducing you to my family.
I call them my family because some I see often
and others when I least expect them.
Can everyone see these?
I'm going to shuffle these cards and you tell me when to stop.
[Sarah] Okay, I haven't started shuffling yet.
Now I'm shuffling.
Got it.
Now I'm going to show you all this card.
Can everyone see this card?
Does anyone work here?
-Can you take this card and show it? -Yeah.
-Don't show it to me. -Oh, okay.
During COVID, I'm also a teacher in a Zoom Room.
But this…
This is where I come alive.
Beep when you've seen it.
-[horn beeps] -[man] I've never worked with a magician.
I was a Frankenstein at a haunted house once, though.
So, you know, I'm used to being around performers.
Is this your card?
I had to get out of that racket 'cause of the Illuminati.
You know, they want to get you.
It's like, not for me. Nope, I'll stick to parking lot attendant.
That's the life for me. Simple.
I think it went okay.
Yeah. I might have to buy giant cards for shows like these in the future.
I don't know. There's a lot of beeping.
So, when is this gonna be on? I just wanna make sure that I catch it.
-[man] Uh, sometime next year. -Okay.
Do you want to see another trick? No? Okay.
[woman] We followed the guidelines. We reopened when it was safe.
But now, it's not safe again.
-[crowd] Aw! -[man 1] Honestly?
-[woman] Orgies. Maybe later. -[man 2] Damn it.
-Wonderful place. -Wonderful.
-Oh, my goodness. -Unbelievable.
Oh, hello.
My name is Natalie, and this is my husband, John.
-Hi, there. -[chuckles]
Welcome to Mar-a-Lago. We love it here.
-It is beautiful. You hear me? -Oh, it's gorgeous.
I know what you're thinking. "Do they allow Black people at Mar-a-Lago?"
-Um, we're here! -Right? Laugh it off.
-We are Black-ish, though. -Last time we checked.
-Last time we checked, we were. -Yes.
And we've actually met the president.
-He saw us… -Yes, we did.
…and he said that we are his two favorite Black people.
-And he says it every single time. -Every time. Mmm-hmm.
Such a charismatic personality he has. He's such a celebrity.
We actually got married here.
Um, not in the big ballroom, but on the property.
So it was still beautiful.
-Yes. -Yeah.
We're not allowed in there right now.
We're not allowed in there yet,
but there is a small room off to the side
with a private entrance, very exclusive.
[laughs] And they said we can go in there whenever we want.
-We can stay in there if we want to. -Anytime.
And then, one night, we actually got locked in there.
And let's just say it was very fortuitous.
-Yes, it got kind of hot in there. -[ominous music playing]
We just love it here.
Just surrounded by all our friends.
Surrounded by all of our friends, which is the most important part.
We got you in our hearts.
Right on.
[Sarah] If you like skateboarding dogs,
you're gonna wanna stick around after Everything's Fine
for Thinking Outside the Bachs with Jordana Bachman.
[Jordana] I don't know what this is about to be, but okay!
[Sarah] Coming up at the twelve o'clock hour.
Let's do the weather segment.
-Love the weather. Love the weather! -[Lorraine] Mmm.
Okay, weather segment in three, two…
And now, let's check in on how the sky's doing today
with our meteorologist, Andrea Steele.
Thanks, Sarah. Well, we're looking at some real clear skies today,
up to 75 degrees. Absolutely beautiful out.
Let's look ahead at the five-day forecast.
Tuesday, we're gonna see a bit of rain, but break out that summer gear
as temperatures shoot up to a whopping 103 degrees.
Wednesday, out of nowhere, there's gonna be a ferocious hailstorm
with sustained winds up to 75-plus miles per hour.
Scooter, you may wanna board up your windows.
My windows are always boarded up.
You know that weird house in your neighborhood
that's got all the boards up in the windows,
and everyone thinks, "Is that an abandoned hospital?"
That's my place.
Excellent. Thursday, you might wanna break out the sunscreen again,
because it's gonna be a hot one.
123 degrees with a humidity index so high,
a friend of mine who works at the EPA called me crying. He's a grown man.
Friday, we shoot down to negative 12 degrees
with a windchill index we weren't even able to calculate
using a Doppler 8000 technology.
It's gonna be a cold one, folks.
Most likely not survivable, so wear a jacket.
And Saturday, temperatures radically return to breezy 75 degrees.
However, that isn't just a cute graphic we made up.
We're actually projecting literal flaming snowmen
to be walking the streets with some possible fire tornado watches in effect.
Everything's fine with the weather. I'm Andrea Steele. Back to you, Sarah.
Andrea, I'm sorry, but that forecast is--
Insane? Uh, yeah. You think?
I mean, I've been doing the weather for 17 years, Sarah,
and I have never seen anything like this in my entire lifetime.
You think I like telling people they're gonna die,
or their skin might peel off if they run to the grocery store?
No one should be going outside unless they absolutely have to.
-[heart beating] -Scooter?
-[narrator] Everything was not fine. -[exhales deeply]
Scooter, are you asleep?
[narrator] Had the world gone mad?
Andrea, are you okay?
Am I okay? This bitch.
Am I okay?
No,
actually, 'cause we got a bat disease just floating around in the sky,
there's a new natural disaster every motherfucking day,
factories destroying the environment. Look at this damn forecast behind me.
This is the first time I've left my house in months!
All it takes is one wrong motherfucker to breathe on me funny,
and I swear to God…
Scooter, are we still on a nine-second delay?
The woman who presses that button stopped coming in weeks ago.
Well, in that case, let me just say this.
Fuck, shitty, doo-doo, bitch, and stay the fuck in your house.
Reporting live from hell on earth, this is Andrea motherfucking Steele.
Back to you, Sarah.
That was great. We'll be right back.
Great. We're out. Nice.
So that's your house I walk by every day.
[Scooter] Yeah.
Ah. My kids are terrified to go past there.
[chuckling] That's the one.
It doesn't look like anyone's lived there in hundreds of years.
-[Scooter] That's my place. -[Andrea] Interesting.
-Well, it's safe. -It's spooky.
-[Scooter] Yeah. -It's awful there.
Everybody ready? Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one.
Welcome back to Everything's Fine. I'm Sarah Cooper.
And now for our top story,
an exclusive look inside that now-famous Access Hollywood bus.
[man's voice] She used to be great. Still beautiful.
[Trump's voice] I moved on her. She was down in Palm Beach.
I moved on her and I failed, I'll admit it.
-Whoa. -I did try and fuck her. She was married.
-That's huge news there. -[Trump's voice] No, Nancy…
This was… And I moved on her very heavily.
In fact, I took her out furniture shopping.
She wanted to get some furniture.
I said, "I'll show you where they have some nice furniture."
Took her out furniture-- I moved on her like a bitch.
But I couldn't get there, and she was married.
All of a sudden I see her, she's now got the big phony tits
and everything. She's changed her look.
Sheesh, your girl's hot as shit.
In the purple.
-[all] Whoa! -[Billy Bush's voice] Yes!
Yes! The Donald has scored!
Oh, my man!
Wait, you gotta look at me when you…
-Thumbs up. -[Trump's voice] You're a pussy.
You gotta put the thumbs up. Gotta get the thumbs up.
You can't be too happy.
-[man 1] Let me… -[man 2] That's funny.
You and I will walk out.
Oh, my God.
Maybe it's a different one.
Better not be the publicist. No, it's her.
[Trump's voice] Yeah, that's her. With the gold.
I gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her.
I'm automatically attracted to beautiful… I just start kissing them.
-It's like a magnet, I just kiss. -[laughing]
I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it.
Just kiss. Just…
-You can do anything. -Whatever you want.
Grab 'em by the pussy.
I can do anything. I can do anything.
Those legs, all I can see is the legs.
Oh, it looks good.
-Come on, shorty. -Ooh, nice legs, huh?
Oof. Get out of the way, honey. That's good legs.
Go ahead.
It's always good if you don't fall out of the bus.
Like Ford, Gerald Ford, remember?
[Bush's voice] Down below. Pull the handle.
Hello. How are you? Hi.
-[Zucker's voice] How are you? -[Trump's voice] Terrific.
-Pleasure to meet you. -You know Billy Bush?
Hello, nice to see you. How you doing, Arianne?
I'm doing well, thank you. Ready to be a soap star?
We're ready. Make me a soap star.
How about a hug for the Donald? He just got off the bus.
-Want a little hug? -[Trump's voice] Absolutely.
Melania said this was okay.
Hug for the Bushy? I just got off the bus.
-Oh! Bushy. -[Bush's voice] Here we go.
Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.
You've got a nice costar here.
-Yes. Absolutely. -[Trump's voice] After you.
Great. We're out. Nice.
Scooter, what is happening?
[Lorraine] This job is made for you, Marvin.
Yeah, it keeps me out of trouble, as they say.
Everything's fine.
Three, two, one, and we're in. Sarah.
And now, a little preview of what's coming on after Everything's Fine.
We'll have Jordana Bachman of Thinking Outside the Bachs,
followed by Sandy Manderson, Miyoko Loco,
and then, Andre Cole Watkins of Watkins the News.
Stick around, it's gonna be a great day. Isn't it, Scooter?
Miyoko Loco.
[chuckles] A little help here.
Save me.
How about Sandy Manderson?
Her face froze?
Help.
Tomorrow, something bad happens to your favorite celebrity.
We'll have a full report.
Now, it's over to Jordana Bachman for Thinking Outside the Bachs.
Jordana, how are you doing?
I'm doing good, girl. How are you, sister-friend?
I'm doing so good. What do you got going on on the show today?
Oh, well, let me tell you. A little bit of this, a little bit of that. Who knows?
It's the news. Who cares?
You know, Jordana, I just realized we don't have to do this anymore.
You have to tell me. Do what? Do what? [laughing]
This whole BFF handoff like we're friends,
laughing like we care about each other.
We don't care about each other.
[Jordana] That, girl, is good news,
because everyone can see through the bullshit!
I don't even know where you live.
I don't even see you except in this TV screen.
That's how I feel, just seeing you through a little box.
What have you been up to?
Girl, I've been up to so much.
I've locked up every Black man in my life.
I put my dad in a closet, my brother in a closet,
my uncle in a closet, to make sure they live another day.
Wow. Where do you put your clothes?
Oh, my God. What are we doing?
Scooter.
I'm sorry?
And now, it is over to you, Jordana Bachman.
Oh, no, girl, I couldn't. I couldn't.
I have to pass it back to you, Sarah Cooper.
You're so funny. Back to you.
You're up next with Thinking Outside the Bachs.
No, Sarah, you got this one. Take my three-hour show.
No, I couldn't. I couldn't do that. Back to you, Jordana. Back to you.
Scooter?
-Oof. -[Sarah] Where'd she go?
Can we get Jordana back, please?
Jordana!
Back to you!
Back to you, Jordana.
All right.
Five, four, three, two…
Good morning. I'm Sarah Cooper, filling in for another three hours.
Jordana Bachman of Thinking Outside the Bachs
is taking a personal day.
Good morning. I'm Sarah Cooper. That's a lot of news.
And it's Sarah filling in for Andre Cole Watkins.
Five, four, three, two…
Good morning. I'm Sarah Cooper, covering for Andre Cole Watkins,
host of Watkins The News.
Is that a lot of news or what?
Three, two… [mouths]
Good morning. I'm Sarah Cooper filling in for Miyoko Loco of Miyoko You Loco.
Okay, Sarah. Three, two, one…
Follow me. [laughing]
Ooh, weather.
Good morning.
I'm Sarah Cooper.
I'm Sarah Cooper.
And everything's fine.
I'm Sarah Cooper.
I'm Sarah Cooper and everything's fine.
Everything's great.
It's gonna be a great day.
I'm Sarah Cooper.
I'm Sarah Cooper.
Good morning. I'm Sarah Cooper.
I'm Sarah Cooper and everything's fine.
That's a lot of news.
[Trump's voice] A lot of people are saying… It's called fake news.
Nobody's ever seen anything like it.
A lot of people are saying… It's called fake news.
Nobody's ever seen anything like it.
A lot of people are saying… It's called fake news.
Nobody's ever seen anything like it.
A lot of people are saying…
It's called fake news.
Nobody's ever seen anything like it.
[Scooter] Great job, Sarah Cooper.
Where'd she go?
Why is that chair spinning?
Is that a ghost?
Yes?
Oh, no. Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.
[Scooter] Sarah's doing great.
-Good morning. -[Scooter] She's doing very well.
Great morning. Great…
-Hi! -[shrieks]
Oh, my God! Who are you? What are you doing down here?
I'm Lacy Groin, from Against the Groin?
My show.
It's on every night at 9:00.
Oh, my God.
Lacy Groin!
-Yeah. -I love your show.
Oh, thank you.
It's been off the air for, like, four years.
-Four years? -[heart beating]
The last thing I remember was election night,
and I started hyperventilating.
I choked on my Invisalign,
and then I guess I passed out under here.
It's kinda weird nobody noticed.
Yeah. I found this work environment to be pretty toxic.
What did I miss?
I want to know everything.
Would you mind massaging my legs?
I think they're in atrophy.
-Cute shoes. -Thanks.
-That's a cute blazer. -Thank you.
So, tell me everything. What did I miss?
You want to know everything?
Oh, yeah. Everything.
Here's everything.
-No. -No, stop! No!
-Oh, God! -What?
That's against the law.
-No, no! -Yes, there's more!
No, I can't.
-Oh, God! -Look at me!
-There's more! -No! -There's more! -No!
I…
-I can't. -Here.
-Oh, MrPillow. -Hi.
Thank you. Gracias.
-Mmm. -See you later, Lacy.
Scooter?
Hello?
[Lorraine] Marvin, you're crazy.
[Marvin] Yes, I am.
[Lorraine] But what if we slot the Iranian assassination in 2024?
[Marvin] No, no, no.
I would do it sooner
because we want relations with Iran to go as poorly as possible.
Put it in 2021.
-[Lorraine] Okay. -Yes.
What if we shave two tons off the Greenland ice sheet?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2028 or 2022?
2027.
And let's do something with bugs.
I don't know. Hornets!
Who love to murder.
[both] Murder hornets!
-Oh! -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And China seizes Hong Kong, 2028.
And that pairs very nicely
with the US gassing its own citizens.
-[giggles] -Floods, 2026.
What if Tom Hanks gets sick?
Do it! He's due!
Kill off Mr. Peanut?
Cancel Coachella.
I hate those bands.
Eating bats?
I… No, that's too much.
Let's set Australia on fire! Turn the sky red!
[distorted voice] Do it all in 2020.
Really, boss?
That's a lot for one year, Dark Lord.
I said, do it all in 2020!
Okay, boss!
Uh, Satan.
Sarah, I understand.
You're mad as hell, and you're not gonna take this anymore. Hmm?
-Scooter? -Hey, boss.
Hey, Scooter.
I… I get it now.
I didn't see that before.
How'd you get in here?
You should really get back to the desk.
Back to the desk, Sarah Cooper.
I think I should go home.
[Whoopi's voice] What you gonna do, Satan? You know, we've tangled before.
And you know what happened.
It's Whoopi Goldberg talking to you now. What you gonna do?
[in normal voice] Oh, my God. I don't know where that came from.
[narrator] At this moment,
Sarah Cooper realized it wasn't she who had lost her mind,
it was the world.
Scooter, help me out.
You should just take the afternoon off.
I just went scuba diving.
I love scuba diving. You scuba dive?
-Love it. -Maybe we should give her a raise.
A raise would be great.
I'm not gonna get a raise.
I am a woman, so that does make more sense.
Take all the time you need, Sarah.
[in distorted voice] Never running out of news down here.
Great. Okay.
Well, I will just see you a little later.

[woman] I live in a very small cave and I love it.
I can have orgies every night.
You name it. Orgies, Doritos.
Maybe sometimes a Fanta.
It's so nice.
I'm not lying.
Sometimes I lie a little bit, okay.
Intentional or not, when two people meet, power always shifts to either of them.
Maybe we all have these hidden desires
either to dominate or to submit to someone.
And I'm wondering if you have
one of these desires in your heart that you can't reveal.
-Jung Jihoo. -Yes?
You clocked in the first on your first day!
Good morning.
Right.
I didn't mean you, Jiwoo, but Jihoo.
Hello.
In Mr. Yang's place,
our PR team has Jung Jihoo, aka Mr. Perfect from the business team.
Nice to meet you! Welcoming applause!
By the way, Jung Jihoo and Jung Jiwoo.
Very similar names.
It can be confusing when addressing you two.
Why would it be? Their job titles are different.
Let's have a team dinner after work.
Which one do you prefer? Lamb chop or lamb chop?
Lamb chop.
Sir, lamb chop sounds good, but we maxed out our company card.
And we haven't cleared up the issue about the YouTuber you mentioned before.
No, Jiwoo.
We have the issue only because you personally hate him.
He has so many subscribers.
It wouldn't be right to have someone who is homophobic in educational shows.
I wouldn't say he's homophobic. He just said it made him uncomfortable.
Sir.
Why don't you rethink if he can be risky
as your decision can reflect the image of our channel?
Jiwoo, be more like him.
If you must kill the efficiency of the meeting
with an issue that's already been discussed,
at least try to be polite like him, with a smile. Isn't it nice?
Being nice and cute works in many ways.
Sir,
did you say "cute"?
What I mean is our work is all about teamwork,
so let's keep a nice working environment.
This kind of stuff is hard since we have many girls here. Gosh.
It's odd how you react to what he said. My old team wouldn't tolerate it.
What do you mean?
Sir, didn't you know? It can be considered as sexual harassment.
Pass! We were testing his gender sensitivity, weren't we?
For me, you passed!
Then,
I have an idea.
Why don't Mr. Jung and Jiwoo, who's always on the ball, work together
on making a potential casting list?
I can't wait.
Thanks for the coffee.
Let's have another farewell party soon.
-My treat. -He has a fan club.
He has a look that says he's well aware that everyone loves him.
-You don't care for a man like him either? -I do.
-I'm interested. -Really?
-Why is he looking this way? -Seriously?
For real?
Hi, Mr. Popular.
No, they're colleagues from the old team.
Well, Jiwoo…
Yes?
I want to say it's good you stopped a casting disaster.
I believe the PR team needs to catch up with the world.
-Thank you. -I hope we get along.
See you later at the meeting.
Interested? But you don't even blush.
-It's not like I'll do anything about it. -Do what? What do you mean?
How far were you thinking?
Nothing like that at all.
Hey, do something about the look in your eyes if you ever want to date.
do something about the look in your eyes if you ever want to date.
At the change of the seasons, you don't sleep well and feel heavy…
Did he smile at you? Still, never give him an upper hand.
Never ever tell him you like him before he does.
Guys lose interest if girls do that.
Mom, all I said was he's cute. That's all.
Hey, cute guys rarely come by, especially at work.
Well, that's true.
Anyway, why can't girls say how they feel first?
Are we in 1920 or something?
That rule will still apply even in 2220.
Men have this instinct to hunt.
They chase girls and then eat them up. It's their desire to dominate.
Am I a prey, like a rabbit?
Geez.
-And women used to hunt too! -That look again!
Then go back to hunting,
or do something about your boring life.
-Thank you. -Sure.
It can't be. I got a text last night saying it's here.
Nothing for the business team.
No, I'm now in the PR team.
-The PR? -Yes.
I guess that one was for you, Mr. Jung Jihoo.
Someone took it.
What? Who?
Sorry about that.
Oh please!
Jiwoo, hold on!
Ta-da!
It's for my dog. You know, it's mandatory to have a leash.
I'm sorry. I thought it was for me.
I guess it happened because we have similar names, right? Wrong side.
Your dog's name is Miho?
That's right!
Miho. Isn't it a nice name?
Miho is a girl.
-A poodle, three years old. -Okay.
It seems too big for a poodle.
Obviously, you've not seen her. Her neck has bulked up…
Like this, you know?
I see.
-Let me get the leash. -Sure.
I'll throw this out for you.
No, let me!
THE LARGEST SM ADULT SHOP IN THE COUNTRY
15% OFF FOR RE-PURCHASES
Paper is recyclable.
Let me throw them away.
Why throw away the coupon?
You have…
excellent vision.
-Enjoy your lunch. -Enjoy your lunch.
What? There's a pervert?
-A pervert? -He's a pervert?
Mr. Jung, are you okay?
Okay, let's protect our school from the pervert.
Doongi doongi, change!
It's okay. I'm fine.
Let's see where the pervert's hiding!
Luckily, I don't think anyone knows about it yet.
The girl in my team isn't treating me any differently.
There might be hope after all.
Don't be hopeful yet.
My old colleague got caught like you and got fired after the rumors spread.
I wonder if she's one of us.
I saw similar posts in our community.
They met offline and realized they have the same propensity.
There are more out there than we think. No one would guess that about us either.
Maybe Jiwoo too?
Still, revealing it is too risky.
Avoid it at all costs, and be careful.
Now you know all about me…
Sorry, but I can't even wear a turtleneck.
Jiwoo, what are you doing?
Don't just stare. Go on in.
Why not? Shall your mommy buy one for you?
-No, thanks. -Why not?
-What should we have for lunch? -I don't like its color.
-The color should be closer to this. -It's too pale.
Excuse me. Jiwoo isn't coming today?
She went to the venue to check it.
Manager Hwang had her go there.
If only Jiwoo were more flexible.
I agree.
Han, did you move Doong-doong and Toy?
Yes, the prop team moved Toy, and as for Doong-doong…
-I wonder where it is. -Where is it?
Doong-doong!
I'm asking too much from an intern, right?
-Let me get it. -No, I will.
It's okay.
Thank you, sir.
Hi, Jiwoo. How are you doing this weekend?
-I just want to say thank you and sorry… -Yes, ma'am.
I checked the venue, and now I'm in the supply room. Yes.
Oh my.
Who are you?
Why are you wearing that?
Doongi doongi, Doong-doong!
Mr. Jung?
-No, no! -Wait a minute!
Oh no! Mr. Jung! Gosh!
-Are you okay? -Yes.
What do you mean you're okay?
Are you stupid? What were you doing?
I'm sorry.
Don't move.
Are you dizzy?
I'm good. Doong-doong is well padded.
Still, you hurt your head. You need to go to the hospital.
-Let's go now! -I'm fine, really.
Sorry for wasting your time on the weekend.
What did you mean?
I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AND SORRY.
I wanted…
to thank you for not saying anything even after you saw all that.
Of course. Why gossip about others?
Thank you, and thank you for today. And I'm sorry.
Have a seat.
Sure.
I want to say I'm sorry too.
Pardon?
You must've been surprised because I was bossy, yelling at you.
To be honest,
I have a propensity to do that.
A propensity?
Still, I've never shown it at work…
I wonder if she's one of us.
She might have a propensity of her own.
You don't need to avoid me.
I might not look the part, but I care about what people think of me.
-So you too-- -Jiwoo.
Thank you for being so honest with me.
I'm so glad and thankful.
I was so worried that you'd think I'm a pervert,
but thank God you're also into that. What a coincidence!
-I don't think you're a pervert. -I know, exactly!
The world is cruel for seeing us that way.
To be honest,
I could sense that from you.
If you find it hard to hide, you can do it to me if it's okay with you.
Do what?
You can be bossy or yell at me. Just treat me as your dog from now on!
People like us don't find each other at work.
Let's just be open with everything!
I'm sorry. When I said a propensity,
I didn't mean it that way.
-Sorry? -I meant,
because I've been told I look cold and scary,
so I'm self-conscious about that.
Oh, I see.
Then the collar…
It wasn't for a woman but for yourself?
It's not like that.
Let's talk about D and S, which mean dominance and submission.
Sit, Pippi.
Sit.
Down.
Spin. Good girl.
A Dominant plays the role of a ruler.
On the other hand, a Sub is submissive to his/her Dominant.
Hey, what's wrong with her today?
She always pets the dog with her eyes like this.
She is glued to her phone today.
Really?
In short, we call them Dom and Sub.
-Would you like a dom? -What's a dom?
Why are you jumpy? We have doldom fish today.
I'll give you a discount.
I don't get what you're saying.
Be more specific, as you usually are.
It's like…
as if Woohyuk has never liked dogs.
He loves dogs. He's more like a dog than a dog itself.
But it's like he's scared of them,
but he's afraid people might call him a psycho for hating dogs.
So he acts like every other person.
But you happen to find out his truth.
You're making even less sense,
but go on.
I'm not sure if it'd be better to pretend like I don't know
or should I be nicer to him?
Do you like this dog-hater or not?
I do.
He's cute.
Just look the other way and give him some time.
He must be embarrassed.
It'll be worse if you act too nice.
Doong-doong has more followers now. That's why I like these offline events.
Thank God people love it, or else we'd get an earful from Mr. Hwang.
He couldn't care less about the preparation.
Now, he's sending screenshots of the number of Doong-doong's followers.
He should be here instead of asking us to send photos.
Let me check the stage schedule at the headquarters.
Sure.
Shit.
-A video call now? -You can do this.
Mr. Hwang, can you see me?
Jiwoo, isn't it time for lunch?
What are you doing? You can't take this off here.
I'll let you know when it's time.
-Put it on. -Water--
Sorry, but let me go to the headquarters. Keep it up.
Jiwoo.
-I'll go with you. -No, I can do it alone.
Then I'll do it.
No, I will. Thank you, Mr. Jung.
Are you trying to fry the meat?
Is it an air fryer? Let me.
Jiwoo, over here!
Have some chips.
-Thank you. -Thank you, sir.
It's so hard.
Did I overcook it? Should we get more?
No, that's not necessary.
Did you check the reviews on Instagram?
People loved the event.
-I said it was a good idea. -Soju?
-You did, sir. -No one listens…
-Good thing we did. -Damn it.
Good job.
You're good even at grilling.
What's your flaw? What do you think, Jiwoo?
That's not how to grill--
-Men should know… -I wouldn't know.
-It's not like we're close. -Women should know how to cut fruits.
Women must learn to cut fruits to find a good husband.
How obnoxious.
He's so obnoxious.
-See you. -Get home safely.
-Good luck with Jihoo, your crush! -Bye!
Why can't I get a taxi here?
Why do I hear a dog whimper--
Oh my God!
Mr. Jung?
What are you doing?
Are you sick?
Are you crying?
No…
Sure you are.
No, I'm not.
Why are you crying?
I like you.
And if you find me obnoxious,
I understand, but…
As I was just transferred to this team,
it's hard to ask for another transfer.
I'm so sorry.
You are such a crybaby.
I've never told anyone besides you and Hana.
Who is Hana?
My ex who dumped me for being a pervert!
Mr. Jung, I didn't avoid you because I hate you,
but because I didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable.
That's why.
I'm just giving you some space.
So I'm not obnoxious?
I told you I don't think you're a pervert.
Or maybe you are.
Aren't we all somewhat perverted?
Do you know…
how cool you are?
I am?
Jiwoo, I'm wondering…
Would you be my master?
That's…
I'm not asking you out or anything. Just purely be my master.
-Purely? -Yes!
I'd love to have someone like you as my master.
No.
Right?
I'm sorry.
This won't ever happen again.
Aren't you calling a driver?
You always break the machine.
I think something is jammed in here.
It gives me a good excuse to see you.
You can call me anytime.
I know you just say that. You're always busy when I call you.
Stop staring like that.
Jiwoo,
you can't seduce a man with a glare like that.
-I'm not trying to seduce him. -Look at them.
They are all googly-eyed for him.
Try crossing the line sometimes.
See you.
Mr. Jung.
Well done.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Jung, do you have time? I have something to tell you privately.
I'll wait in the lounge.
Okay, what is it?
Wear this.
-Sorry? -I'm not your master, but I'm curious.
Wear this.
Is this a dream?
I didn't expect you'd be--
No? Okay. I never said no.
I'll wear it.
-Actually, Jiwoo-- -Sit back here.
What you said the other night got me curious about something.
What is it?
You said you want your master to be someone like me?
What did you mean by that?
I've never seen anyone like you.
To be honest,
I've always been self-conscious.
I pretend to be mature enough not to be hated by others.
But regardless of what others think, how unfairly you're treated,
even with a freak like me, you're still the same mature person.
You stay true to yourself.
I feel so reassured, even though we're not close friends,
that I want to act like a kid around you.
I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable again.
That's okay.
I promise I won't cross the line ever again.
I'm not sure what exactly you want from me,
but I can learn things pretty quickly.
I'll think about it for now,
so would you stop avoiding me?
Really?
Of course.
Then count to 30, take off the blindfold, and return to the office.
Thank you, Jiwoo.
You're the coolest person I've ever met.
Count to 30 before you take it off.
You're not my master yet.
You're like a puppy waiting for someone.
I was waiting for you.
Are you trying to hit on me by sharing your umbrella?
I'm just trying to convince you
of how sincere I am to serve you as my master.
I know why you look at me like that.
Why?
You want to look at
everything with full attention,
just like that.
Okay.
I'll be your master.
Follow me closely so I don't get wet.
Yes, ma'am.
Don't change your mind tomorrow.
DS.
It stands for a relationship between a Dominant and a Submissive.
A relationship between one who commands and one who obeys.
Dom as in dominant and Sub as in submissive.
Depending on the gender,
we can have a Male-Dom, Female-Dom, Male-Sub, and Female-Sub.
That means
Mr. Jung is
a Male-Sub?
This is crazy.
I have wonderful news! I finally have a mistress!
Make some noise!
HOW TO BE A GOOD MISTRESS
SPANKING FEMFEM'S BDSM GUIDE
A difference between DS and SM?
DS is more about the psychological aspect that stems from the relationship.
Whereas SM is
about the physical and sensational play.
Of course, the two concepts aren't disparate.
You can still enjoy SM play within the DS relationship.
Those involved in DS or SM aren't usually dating their partners.
DS and SM relationships tend to be vertical,
while lovers should be equal.
Of course, anything is possible.
But I just feel it's difficult to manage both.
It feels good, Jihoo.
Did your ex not like it?
She did when she didn't know about my propensity,
but despised me after she learned.
You said you like being despised?
You pervert.
Sorry for being late on my first call. I won't make the same mistake--
We need to set rules.
Set rules that only apply to the two of you.
Rules?
Don't call me master anymore.
"Jiwoo" will do.
-What about "Ms. Jiwoo"? -Just "Jiwoo."
Or else, I'll punish you.
Punish me?
Why do you look so excited? I'm not!
Not at all.
Punish and compliment him regularly.
I've read that a Sub can feel tied down just by having a gift from the master.
Jiwoo,
you studied, didn't you?
Make up a condition for your commands.
These glasses are the signal.
When you need my command at work, wear them.
Would you like to use a stamp or a signature?
-Sorry? -For the contract.
Jung Jiwoo, aka Dom, must carry herself in an ideal manner,
which Jung Jihoo, aka Sub, can look up to.
You had spicy pork last night, but you crave spicy food.
I'll order four tteokbokki, two mild and two hot, with rice balls.
With Coolpis too.
And Sub ought to try his best to serve his Dom.
The contract will expire three months upon its execution.
It cannot be terminated without consent.
Play will be carried out at least once a week.
Dom and Sub can designate a safe word for urgent or dangerous situations.
Once used, the play must stop immediately.
A safe word can be a phrase we don't use daily
or something that's easy to pronounce.
For example, Planet of the Apes, soondae soup, and so on.
Anything you've wanted to use?
I want it to be special and meaningful to both of us.
Something meaningful?
Doong-doong?
Having sex should be mutually consented.
It's a contract template I found on the Internet.
I barely made any changes.
Yes, I understand your concern.
No touch.
I have zero naughty desire for you.
JUNG JIHOO
Some of the so-called hotels are worse than motels.
I'm not some expert on motels, though.
Where would be the cleanest?
-The best-- -It's all on the app.
-Turn right. -Sure.
You've never used it?
No.
But there's something aesthetically pleasing about a dog collar,
so I'm fine just looking at--
It's meant to be worn.
It's crucial that the Dom not be flustered while playing.
The Dom must always look cool to the Sub.
Dog play.
Introductory course to the SM world.
Soft, but a classic play.
-Treat him like a real dog. -Hand.
Head.
I'll give you a treat if you are good.
Okay. Anything you say--
Okay. Anything you say-- Huh? A dog that can speak?
Huh? A dog that can speak?
No!
No!
Don't! Stop!
Sit!
Sit down!
Down!
Bang!
Good boy.
What a good boy.
I said no!
Stop!
Come on! Stop that dog from barking!
How dare a dog talk back to me?
Excuse me, but I'm here to check because we received a complaint.
Thanks for your hard work.
Right, yes.
You too.
"Thanks for your hard work"?
What was that, you stupid?
Just say the editing team put it in by mistake.
-Why must we dig into it? -Sir.
Evading responsibility can cause a bigger problem.
Who cares? It's a kids' show with a rating less than one percent.
Isn't that why we must stick to a strict moral code?
Jiwoo, do you have the press release from the copyright complaint?
-Give it to me. -Sure.
-Han, book the meeting room at 3:00. -Okay.
We'll resolve this first, sir.
Why do I feel threatened?
That was impressive.
Mr. Hwang couldn't say a word. That felt cathartic.
Right. When I went nuts, he treated me as a nut.
I should be better.
No. The better you are, the more he'll insult you for being a girl.
-Jiwoo, the budget bill for the event? -I put it there earlier.
You should've told me.
These brats take me for a piece of shit.
Poor me.
Jiwoo, aren't you leaving?
Mr. Jung,
were you hurt yesterday?
I should've been more prepared. I'm sorry.
If you are sorry,
let me plan the next one.
Enjoy your time.
Happy Birthday to--
You should blow after the song.
Today is not my birthday.
I know. It's tomorrow. I saw on KakaoTalk.
But we'll celebrate at the office, and I want to do it before anyone.
Ma…
Master.
Happy birthday.
Let me do the other.
They are so…
gorgeous, Jiwoo.
Thank you, but I'm not sure I've done enough to deserve these.
-We flopped last time. -No.
You are like the sun to me.
I thank you for being born into this world.
Thank you for the shoes.
Do you want me to step on you?
That wasn't exactly what I hoped for, but…
You didn't hope for it, but you sure look ready.
No, actually…
It must have come out from all those dreams
You dreamed about it?
It's nothing you should be offended by.
Well, it might be a bit, but…
It better be somewhere no one can see.
Does it hurt?
It's killing me.
Shall I stop?
I'm happy
because it's you.
I like to win because I'm competitive.
I hate looking like an easy mark
or losing to self-proclaimed tough guys.
I guess I didn't want them to know that I'm weak,
when I'm a total mess on the inside.
That's why I just love
when everything crumbles.
I love the tumble, being trampled on,
being broken.
Only by you.
Seduce him.
It's a done deal.
He even gave you a birthday gift.
He even shared his secrets, which I don't know.
Aren't you two on the same project?
Ask him to dinner. No, drinks.
Well, that can be an abuse of power.
His job grade is above yours, so why do you worry?
Our private lives should be separate from work.
Yeah, right.
Come on, Pippi, you jealous girl. Stop it.
So loud.
Such a straight arrow.
Do as you wish.
-Going on a date again? -Yes, sort of.
A controlled office romance?
It won't be easy.
Make the font bigger for handouts. What's this?
Do you not want me to see it?
I'm just kidding.
Come on, guys.
Han, introduce yourself in this good atmosphere.
Yes, sir.
Hello.
As you may know, I'm Lee Han, officially a full-time employee.
I'll do my best!
Applause.
I think he needs a mentor to teach him the ropes.
Jiwoo can do it.
Not Jihoo.
She has a lot to take care of this month.
How about Soyeon?
Jiwoo works like no other.
Han, you can survive anywhere if you learn from her.
Okay.
Check the list of Toy's merchandise.
Forward the draft of the print order via email to the planning team.
Update the list of distributors…
Watch your leg.
Update the list.
Jiwoo.
Sorry, but the function won't work on Excel.
Are you sure you're not asking after your first try?
Jiwoo.
What was the third thing you told me to do yesterday?
If you can't remember, record what I say.
You sent the report in a group email?
Must the president read your meeting notes?
-Look. See this file? -Yes.
You should go in there.
Looks like all the changes on the dubbed trailer are confirmed.
I'll send it over now and head to the recording studio.
Right, we don't need to keep revising it. We don't have time for that.
Stop, please.
Hi.
It's hard, right?
-You can ask me questions anytime. -Sorry?
Right. I'm doing great.
Everybody is worried I might be intimidated by Jiwoo,
but I love that about her.
Meaning?
She gets to the point without beating around the bush.
When she sounds intimidating,
she's weirdly sexy.
What did you say?
I see.
-One second. -Sure.
Okay, I'll be right there.
I've got to go to a meeting with Jiwoo. I'll let you go.
-Safe trip. -Thanks.
Jiwoo, come back to the office before you go home.
Mr. Jung?
-I sent it by mistake. -What?
Group email.
You can resend it.
Is that all?
You're not my mentee.
But I belong to you!
Mr. Jung, are you anxious about anything?
No. You're being too good to Lee Han as if you were his master.
This just won't do.
In unexpected situations,
a Dom must know how to play without toys
That's the role and responsibility of every true Dominant.
Sit there.
Take off your belt.
Take off the glasses if you want to stop.
Take it off.
It's thicker than I thought.
Mr. Jung Jihoo, you need to keep your private life separate from work.
You imagine things and get jealous.
Do you not have faith in your master?
Hit me for real.
You can really hit me since I've done you wrong.
It's embarrassing, but I want to feel the pain.
If that's too hard, just kick me or curse at me.
I want you to at least curse at me.
Son of a bitch.
What?
What are you looking at, pervert?
How dare you look at me like that?
Look down.
You can't even fix a coffee machine?
Can you do anything right?
-Is your male ego acting up? -Forgive me.
Jiwoo, I'm sorry.
This won't do. Follow me.
Is there anything you can do?
Is it too hard to review the budget on time?
If you're going to kill our efficiency, at least be polite with a smile,
you low-life scumbag!
Yes, I'm worse than a scumbag.
This stupid copier! It keeps breaking down!
Do it again, you son of a bitch!
There's no time to write every single thing down!
Memorize them!
You're so frustrating, you dumbass!
Yes, I'm a dumbass!
What's wrong with your finger?
Why do you keep sending group emails?
-Forgive me! Teach me one more-- -How many freaking times?
Just think one more time before you send it.
Is that too hard? Damn it!
Damn it!
I'm sorry.
You and your damn back scratcher.
You piece of shit.
You, with your tiny dick,
are one disgusting son of a bitch.
I'm a million times better at work than you are!
Jiwoo.
Is somebody still here?
Did you like that?
What about you?
Me too. It got me excited.
Psychological shackles are just as important as physical SM play.
You may want to strengthen the DS bond with simple daily reports.
I had some cherry tomato salad, bread, and apple-kale juice.
Have you had breakfast? See you at the office.
Yes, master. I mean Jiwoo.
Mr. Jung.
-You'll lose weight if you eat like that. -Then--
Enjoy your lunch.
You've finally learned to appreciate the real flavor of gukbap.
You seem to take pictures of everything.
Are you on Instagram?
For my personal trainer. He checks what I eat.
Right. Did someone work late?
Apparently, the office was a mess.
Really?
One of my things got broken too.
MEOW BACK SCRATCHER
What's this?
You know what you did wrong?
I'm not sure.
I'll let you know.
HANA
Still in touch with her?
Sorry?
Isn't she your ex?
The one you mentioned when you were crying.
We don't keep in touch. It's just that she hates my guts.
Why? She's the one who dumped you.
I understand her.
I told her about my secret to get it off my chest. It was selfish.
Do you really like bleeding like this?
It hurts…
but it makes me feel alive.
I don't get it.
I understand.
If she loved you and this makes you feel alive,
couldn't she just go with it?
It's not a crime.
I don't want to force it to anyone,
which is why I'm thankful you're here.
It feels like you're starting to enjoy DS.
Thanks for your hard work.
I'll go clean up.
I can't believe what I've done, but I can't get it out of my head either.
The more I enjoy it, the more I'm confused about our relationship outside of it.
Is it normal to play as hard as this without having sex?
I'M HOME. WASHED UP AND IN BED NOW. GOING TO WATCH TV AND SLEEP. GOOD NIGHT.
It's hard to say what is and isn't normal.
Many couples end up having sex under consent,
but, as you know, it's all on a case-by-case basis.
What is it that you want?
Talk about it with your Sub.
Oh, Woohyuk!
Good morning.
Why are you alone? Where's your boss?
She'll come later today after a date.
Right, she bragged about going to an arboretum.
She's busy on weekends.
She says she's single but never stops dating.
Then why don't you ask her out too?
No, you got it wrong. She's just my… It's not like that.
Do you jog in the morning?
Good for you.
If you don't tell her, she won't know.
Don't tell anybody yet.
-See you. -See you.
Let's go.
HANA
Hi, Hana.
Hey, Jung Jihoo. Stop pretending to be busy.
It's not like that. Our timing was just off.
What's up?
I'm in Hapjeong. I'm hungover. Buy me kalguksu.
I was just about to leave to go meet someone.
Sorry, Hana.
Next time.
Let's talk later.
I'm hanging up.
Oh, is that right? Okay.
Asshole.
ARBORETUM
Is it the nice weather? I see many couples on dates.
You're right. People might think we're a couple.
We're here purely for the play.
This will--
All day long,
-I order you not to be away from me. -What?
Even out there?
Yes.
No matter what. Until we come back here.
No matter what…
Okay, Jiwoo.
Let's go.
I'm sorry.
Are you sure you're okay? You don't have to wear it too.
Don't talk back. I'm just trying to be fair.
PENGUIN, I'M AT THE PARKING LOT
BE THERE SOON
Wait.
Look at her.
Let me get out right here.
I caught you, Jiwoo.
Check this out. She's not even answering her phone.
Ms. Penguin?
Here's your order of two iced Americanos and bacon sandwich.
Cheer up.
Sorry?
I just want you to cheer up.
Thank you. I will!
I think you should sit closer.
Sure.
Wait. Stay still.
I can do it by myself.
We don't have much of a choice. Open your mouth.
Did you see them?
Don't look.
Thank you.
-Are you crazy? -I'll feed you too.
-No. -Open your mouth.
-Don't. I said stop. -Open your mouth.
Wow.
She's even wiping his mouth.
Mr. Jung.
I got something to tell you today.
What is it, Jiwoo?
That's not bad.
What a place.
Hey, excuse me. Wait.
Why are you taking off your pants?
Don't be coy. You're excited too.
This isn't something we agreed on.
You like being forced.
Shall I hit you first?
I…
I like you, Mr. Jung.
Instead of being colleagues or partners, how about we…
date for real?
Let's date for real.
Let's give it a shot. It's an order.
Actually…
Sorry--
Are you all right? Your head--
Are you okay? Let me clean it…
-What the… Did you see that? -Wow, those are cuffs.
Those are cuffs. Let's try them out?
-Get out of here. You do it. -Why not? Let's do it
Mr. General, no, babe. I got something for you.
Really? You shouldn't have.
Ta-da.
This is called bondage.
This isn't what I wanted.
Let's take this off in the car.
I don't want to.
We'll try it again in a safer environment, so let's uncuff ourselves.
That's not what I mean.
No, Jiwoo.
I don't date.
I'm sorry.
Hi, Hyemi.
It was fate to meet you at Paju SM Theme Motel, Room 506.
Our first play should be perfect, baby.
I may be a Sub,
but don't you think rape play is a bit too much on our first date?
It's not like you're a rapist nor a fake BDSMer, right?
So, what's it going to be?
Hyemi? What are you talking about? Where are you? Hyemi!
What is this?
Paju SM, Room 506!
What was a fake BDSMer again?
-What? -Those sons of bitches!
Be careful.
No, the key!
Jiwoo, let's just go!
It's not far. In 2.3 kilometers, turn right.
Hyemi, are you all right?
It's me, Jiwoo!
Are you in there?
Hyemi!
Too late.
See?
If you're going to join them, pay extra.
-Are you okay? -You must've been worried.
You got me.
I'll explain it later.
-Let's go now. -Shouldn't we call the police?
Hold on.
Just because I'm perverted,
doesn't mean you can treat me like shit.
I took pictures of you, all tied up, with your face on them,
so don't do anything stupid.
Fucking pervert!
When I posted the ad, I got 50 messages.
Half of them are from jerks who write to any girl,
the other half didn't care about my preference.
They just sent photos of their dicks!
Seriously.
But what pisses me off even more
is I am certain it's no use going to the police.
And I didn't take pictures of that jerk.
You know why?
Because
that'd make me just like those assholes.
I heard a lot of fakes try to do that, pretending to be Doms.
Assholes.
Most of them don't even know about DS.
You must be that dog-phobic man?
Sorry?
Nice to meet you.
He's cute.
-Eyes on the road while driving. -Right.
Yeah, right, he's cute.
Let's date for real.
It's an order.
No, Jiwoo.
I don't date.
I'm sorry.
WHAT I SAID EARLIER
MR. JUNG
This is freaking crazy.
ONE WEEK BEFORE CONTRACT EXPIRES
Hey, Jihoo. Wait!
What the hell are you talking about?
It's just that we sometimes bite and spank, right?
It's similar to that.
You liked it too.
That's just a way of showing affection. It's not like doing sick stuff.
Don't you need to see a psychiatrist?
Do you have childhood trauma?
This is who I am, Hana.
I wanted to be honest with you. I thought about it a lot.
Honest?
What about all the things we did together? Was it all fake?
You weren't even turned on and wanted something else.
You forced yourself through it, didn't you?
No, that's not true, Hana.
You should've taken it to your grave.
You creep me out.
I get where he's coming from.
Some people go out with their DS partners.
You'd think it would be good, but it's not as easy as you think.
Taming is a form of love,
but that's not all there is to love.
I know.
You know what humiliates me the most?
I assumed he would say yes.
Right.
He'd been nothing but obedient so far,
and he loves to obey me.
I'm no different from those fakes.
-Boss. -Yes?
This'll help you heal without a scar, hon.
Please don't hit on me.
If I date you at my age-- That'd be a jackpot.
I mean, it doesn't have to be me, but enough with the weirdos, please.
I'd rather see all the weirdos than you. Okay?
You can go now.
Go on!
You're different from the fakes.
You tried, at least.
This wasn't even a big-budget project. Thank you for helping us out with it.
Don't mention it.
The business team and we are like a family.
Mr. Jung, keep following it up.
You got it, sir.
Mr. Jung, where did you get those glasses? Can I try them--
Come on. You're making things awkward.
It's just that I'm looking for new glasses.
-Even I feel uncomfortable. -No, it's just…
I must keep these on. It's like my lucky charm.
I didn't know you were superstitious.
I like that human side of you. Ms. Choi, forgive him.
Jiwoo.
You have something on your mind?
What?
No.
I drank too much last night.
It hurts, like, right here on my bladder.
What's wrong? Did something happen between you guys?
I thought you two were getting closer.
-I'm heading out. -See you next week.
Have a great weekend.
-See you. -Okay.
-Mr. Jung. -Yes!
See you.
Let's have our final play tomorrow as planned.
Bondage is the epitome of SM play.
From the quality of the rope to the tightness of the knot,
there's a lot to consider, making this a difficult task.
The one who's tied up
feels the blood slowing down, and the dizziness
giving off a feeling of euphoria and freedom.
Freedom from being tied up, the paradox of pain.
As difficult as it is, you can never predict the outcome.
Idiot, you don't even ask who's at the door?
Hana, are you drunk? You should've called.
You didn't answer.
Not today…
I broke up with my boyfriend.
You fought again?
My friends won't listen to this kind of story anymore,
but you will, right?
Yes, I can do that.
But not now.
You owe me one.
And you can never pay me back for the rest of your life.
I hate that stupid look.
Okay. I'm sorry for everything, but not--
Could you be more freaking obvious?
You can't do this to me.
You have no right to look at me like that. I won't let you.
It annoys me to see you live as if nothing happened.
You think I can live like that?
I'm scared of everything because of you, even dating.
Neither can I.
I'm also scared of dating because of you.
Do you know how much it hurt me?
It hurt me too, Hana.
You may not understand,
but I wasn't accepted for who I was even for a second.
And that hurt me.
I may not be wrong.
There might not be anything wrong with me.
JUNG JIWOO
Okay, I'll go.
But I swear,
you'll never truly love someone
because you won't give up anything.
The only person you love is you.
You saw her, right?
I mean, Hana.
Are you back together? No, that's not it.
She still hates me so much.
She wouldn't hate you
if it weren't for love.
Does it hurt?
Just say it.
I can do much more for you.
It's our final play.
Do anything you want. No regrets.
Stop, Jihoo!
I can't do this.
I'm not sure what I'm doing.
I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?
Jiwoo.
Do you know why Mercury is small and dark?
Because it's too close to the sun.
It burned up like coal and shrank.
I like the warmth, but…
I'm scared I'll burn away.
Jiwoo,
you're my sun.
The first sun I've ever met.
The one and only.
Our final play ends here.
We have one less mouth to feed.
Jiwoo's out on sick leave.
She's human after all.
I thought she was a robot.
Sir.
Thank you, Han.
-On my desk. -Sure.
Sir, aren't you wearing them today?
The glasses. Your special lucky charm.
I envy you for having something that special.
You didn't need to make me porridge.
I didn't. I bought it.
Good. It's delicious.
Eat up, and go back to sleep.
What? What is it this time?
I didn't say anything.
You're saying it with your eyes.
It's just, you can't control how one feels.
Don't get too worked up about it.
Easy!
I think I gave Jiwoo a hard time.
She's not even one of us. I shouldn't have asked her.
You're flattering yourself too much.
It was Jiwoo's choice.
She thought about it thoroughly.
She wouldn't ask you out for a beer.
She thought it'd be an abuse of power.
What a straight arrow.
She was cool from the get-go.
That got me excited.
Is that your propensity talking or the man you are?
-At first, I was sure which one. -Okay.
But I'm not so sure anymore.
I'm so pathetic, aren't I?
Goodness.
I'm a mess,
but so are you.
Does your life get any better when you keep hating on yourself?
If you have time for that,
try to be responsible for your feelings.
CAREFUL FOR WATCHFUL EYES AT WORK
Shit.
Jiwoo, be careful.
Only few would understand.
ATTACHMENTS 1 UNTITLED01.M4A
Sit there.
Take off your belt.
It's thicker than I thought.
What?
Hit me for real.
EMAIL RECIPIENTS UNTITLED01.M4A
After all that acting like an upright, perfect know-it-all,
what's this?
What are you going to do? Answer me!
So, Han won't come to work? Is he quitting?
And why isn't Mr. Jung here yet?
There he is.
-What's going on? -Go to the meeting room.
Nothing's been confirmed. Yes.
Looks like people keep posting on the online forum.
Send out a notice. Anyone sharing it will be disciplined.
-Yes, ma'am. -Yes, ma'am.
How humiliating. From the PR team?
Get in here.
I HEARD ABOUT IT. WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT?
I MEAN, FREEDOM OF CHOICE, BUT AT THE LOUNGE OF ALL PLACES?
Hey, looks like that girl Jung Jiwoo will have to resign.
Which one is the pervert, him or her?
They both are.
How can anyone like the beating? Is it a turn-on?
Curious? Want some?
Shut up, or you might get whipped with a belt.
HIT ME WITH YOUR BEST SHOT. THAT'S HOT.
MR. JUNG JIHOO
I'm sorry. The person you've called is unavailable.
Please try to call back later.
I'm her colleague. She won't answer my calls.
Just a colleague?
Sorry?
If so, she would've answered.
If it weren't for me,
you wouldn't have to suffer humiliation like this now.
It's all my fault.
But at the same time,
the thought of people knowing my true nature
makes me want go to hide somewhere.
Pathetic, right?
Jiwoo…
We'll begin the disciplinary hearing.
Sit there.
Remove your belt.
Take it off.
It's thicker than I thought.
Hit me for real.
That's enough.
What exactly…
is your relationship?
What's all this taking off and beating each other about?
The issue here is breaking the rule at a workplace,
not our private lives.
That's exactly what we need to know to figure out what you violated.
We're not just any other company!
What if it spreads around online on forums for moms?
By the way, Ms. Jung, I guess you're a lady by day and a vamp by night.
Was it that funny?
Just let it all out.
We don't want it to get out of hand either.
We'll just say a young couple got carried away in a romantic relationship.
That's right. Take this as a chance to clean up your acts,
or is that not your taste, Mr. Jung?
Dating might actually be more awkward.
They might've just been sexual partners.
Right.
It can be exciting the first few times to follow a girl's lead,
but if it continues, I mean, a man--
Are you aware your comments can be problematic?
Wow, you're as amazing as I've heard.
You didn't do anything more than that in the lounge, right?
Yes, answer me. Did you have sex or not?
You won't regret what you said, right?
-I will-- -Enough!
I asked her to punish me. It wasn't her fault.
We will decide whether or not she did something wrong.
So you're saying it happened because of your weird taste?
That's right. I like being ordered and stepped on.
I'm the one to blame, so stop with the debate.
-Mr. Jung, Doong-doong. -I'm not obeying you today.
-What did she say? -Doong-doong.
Huh? Is that some password?
Never mind.
So to sum up, Mr. Jung has no special feeling for Ms. Jung,
but just likes being stepped on, right?
Then, Ms. Jung, do you like him or hitting him?
Let's make it clear.
You got it wrong. I…
like Jiwoo.
Mr. Jung, this isn't the place--
I like her, and I want to go out with her.
So don't talk about her like that.
So you like her.
But you know you'll still be disciplined?
I don't care if I'm disciplined or fired. I need to say this.
As I've said, I'm a weirdo who caused this commotion,
but not her.
Honestly, I think everyone here is crazy except for her.
She's a competent and cool lady who did her job that I gave, perfectly.
That's why I fell for her.
Is it wrong? Is that against the regulations?
You're the ones crossing the line, being rude to our faces!
Shame on you!
Jiwoo,
I know it's not the right time again,
but I like you.
Screw the contract or disciplinary action.
As a colleague, a human being, and a man, I respect and like you.
You can't imagine how much I like you.
I like you.
Regardless, it's provocative.
Yes, I guess we are provocative.
From now on, we'll only be provocative outside of the office.
Any other questions?
No regrets, too, I hope.
You didn't have to go that far.
You're cool when you're tough, and you're pretty when you smile.
Am I not pretty without a smile?
Are you stupid? How could you not be?
I can't believe it.
You've become very insolent now that our contract is over.
Should I renew it?
You don't need to do anything that's hard for you.
There you go again.
Stop making assumptions.
I like taking on challenges,
and I kind of enjoyed this too.
Let's try both.
-DS and dating. -Really?
Let's renew our contract thoroughly, so you don't get burned.
It's worth getting fired.
We don't know that yet.
Sorry?
ANONYMOUS
Mr. Hwang, when are we going away?
Don't call me Mr. Hwang.
My wife is sensitive.
Baby, let's go on a business trip to Busan and have mackerel sashimi.
That crazy bastard spy.
Sir, I called the hottest girls…
What's that?
-It's in a group chat room. -Really?
Han, Jiwoo is asking for you.
Okay.
If our conversation was recorded, I thought there must be others as well.
Hit me for real.
This won't do. Follow me.
Mr. Hwang, when are we going away?
Jiwoo, I'm sorry to put you on the spot,
but it'll get me in trouble.
Aren't you going to quit anyway?
Then help me.
Suspended? Do they even get paid?
Are they the only two?
JUNG JIHOO SIX-MONTH SUSPENSION
JUNG JIWOO THREE-MONTH PAY CUT
Our team lost too many people.
Take charge of the events for now. That's the punishment.
Yes, ma'am.
-Will you quit if the work is too hard? -Yes.
No relationship in the world is perfectly equal, I think.
But we'll try hard for life to love someone, equally.
Are you going on a date again?
With you. Let's close the shop.
-Oh no! James, don't! -Hyemi!
Watch it. "Boss," okay?
Dom or Sub,
or S or M, we all are looking
for someone who can accept our true selves under the mask,
the unique love you might find if you don't give up.
If you could find that person,
it might be worth flipping your life upside down.
Do you really want to be bitten?
I want to hug, kiss, and do all that,
but I'd like to take things slow and enjoy every step.
Then, by your standard, would this be step one?
That's right.
Jiwoo…
We're trying DS and dating.
I thought I should let you know, FemFem.
Thank you.
Congratulations on meeting someone like that.
I'm rooting for your DS and love.
You're cute most of the time
but cuter when you're tied up like this.
Then tie me up all the time.
We'll see about that.
But as for today, I won't let you go until I'm satisfied.
What're you doing?
Well, I couldn't sleep.
And it has been such a hellish year for us as you know,
and I just seem to be working every day without even realizing it.
And you are just constantly anxious about your job
because of all the budget cuts. So, I went online this morning
and I rented us a beautiful house out by the beach.
And it was such a steal even though it's barely the off-season.
-[bag zipping shut] -Wait, are… are you packing?
Yeah. I thought I'd get a jump on it.
Wait. I don't understand.
When did you rent a house for?
Today.
I figured if I made the reservation and packed our bags,
it would eliminate most of the reasons to say no.
Oh, and I printed out the little thingy there for you from the website.
It's right by your coffee, made it just the way you like it.
I didn't want to wake the kids so I haven't packed for them yet.
But honestly, I think they're going to be super psyched about this.
Well, you know me, I'm always down for a little vacay.
Especially with the kids. We haven't done that in a while.
But help me out here, babe. I mean… [chuckles] …why today?
Well, when I couldn't fall back asleep this morning, I came over here.
To watch the sunrise.
And I saw all these people starting their day
with such tenacity. Such verve.
All in an effort to…
…make something of themselves.
Make something of our world.
I felt so lucky to be a part of that.
But then, I remembered…
…what the world is actually like.
And I came to a more accurate realization.
I fucking hate people.

[woman on phone] How fun. East Hampton, right?
No, no. It's a cute little town. Actually, I think they call it a "hamlet."
That's how cute it is.
It's a lot closer to the city and still very far away from, well, everyone.
[woman on phone] Ugh, sounds exactly like what you need right now.
After you answer some questions about the Confictura account?
Please? Pretty please?
Well, we're going to have to speed count it here, Jocelyn.

Well, no, Dad, I don't care that she farted.
I-I care that she lies about it.
We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Yeah. Sorry, boys. This ride's closing.
[softly] Ugh. Come on. Ugh.
[Amanda] Yeah okay. Okay sure.
Dad, when we get back to the city,
can you take me to see the coffee shop in Friends?

[announcer on television] Trying to make it a three-hit day.
And keep this one going.
They're not mine. I swear. They're not mine.
Relax. I bought them.
I know you like to sneak a smoke here and there.
I figured we're on vacation. Why not?
I want you to have a good time. Just don't let the kids see you.
Okay. Oh, hey, hey.
I got another idea for a good time. Hm?
M-Maybe?
[Amanda] We've got 15 minutes before they're begging to go to the beach.
That's all I need.
Sunblock? Sunblock?
-Yep, yep, yep. -Yeah.
We practically have the beach to ourselves.
[young woman] The undertow's horrible…
[girl] Look at that boat.
It's so big.
Hey, Mom, Taylor just dropped a pin.
Can you, uh, can you look at that and see how far her house is?
Just look. Y-You said maybe we could drive over there.
-Right? So, maybe? -Mm-hmm.
All right, that's Sag Harbor. That's at least an hour away, honey.
It's getting closer.
-What is? -The ship.
Oh, yeah. She's a beaut. Looks like an oil tanker.
Must be a port around here.
I read this piece in The Atlantic
that says New York has one of the largest natural harbors on the planet.
You okay, Rose?
I think that ship is heading towards us.
What was that, sweetie?
-Clay? -Hmm?
-Clay. -Yeah.
Wow. It's getting close, huh?
You think that's a problem?
Nah, come on. It's gonna stop. It's got to.
Right?
Wake up. Archie, come on, bud. Help us pack up.
Leaving already? Why?
-[boat rumbling] -Holy fuck.
Jesus, Archie, let's go.
-Let's go! Go, go, go! -[beachgoers screaming]
Come on, keep it moving. Keep it moving, guys.
Excuse me, officer. Do you know what happened?
There's been a handful of these groundings up the coast,
something to do with the nav system. Sorry guys, I need you to keep it moving.
Keep it moving, guys.
There's a Starbucks.
Oh.
I wanted to read up on what happened at the beach but the Wi-Fi isn't working.
You think the router needs a reset?
Well, sorry, I can't help you there. You are the tech wiz, not I.
You know, the TV's out too.
I tried to check the game but there's no signal.
You still gonna be down for burgers tonight?
Yeah, I could be down for that.
Meanwhile, the kids seem to have completely gotten over it
like it was something they saw on a show.
They're on to the next episode.
[whispering] Clay.
Come here, look.
[whispering] Oh, wow.
That's a good omen. Seeing deer.
Hmm.
At least according to Mesoamerican mythology.
You gonna help? Hmm?
Uh, wha-- Yes. Yes, I'm here to help.
Uh-oh.
-[gasps] -[laughs]
-[Clay] Don't, don't do it that way. -[Amanda] No, no, no, no, no. Well…
-Don't, don't go in the middle. -No, I'm gonna go in the middle.
Because it'll make it harder for you. And isn't that the point of my life?
You getting some more? Would you top me up?
Uh-huh.
Sure, but I think I'm donezo. I need a glass of water,
or I'm going to have a motherfucker of a hangover tomorrow.
Hey, you remember that student of mine who was published last year? Maria Miller?
Well, she wants me to write the foreword to her second book.
I mean, you know, she says I'm some kind of huge inspiration.
I never know if I'm even getting through to these kids
-and then something like this happens… -[thud]
Shh!
-Did you hear that? -Mm-mm.
Her second book is like an exploration
of how media serves as both an escape and a reflection.
Which is a contradiction
-that she manages to reconcile. -[thud]
[whispering] Someone's here.
Get a bat.
-A bat? -Yeah.
Why would I have a bat?
[man] I'm sorry. Hello?
I'm sure it's nothing. Let me take care of it.
Actually, you know what? Get your cell phone.
Just, you know, just in case.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
Hello. Hi.
-I'm so sorry to bother you. -In case you didn't know. [chuckles]
[chuckles] Well, can I help you?
I know it's late. A knock at the door, way out here.
Couldn't decide if we should knock at the front door or the side door,
and this went on for some time.
I thought we should try the side door because it has glass
and you'd have seen us and known we're just…
You must be Amanda.
A-Amanda Sandford, right?
You, you two know each other?
No, we have not had the pleasure of meeting face-to-face.
I'm- I'm G.H. G.H. Scott.
George. He's George. That's how it reads in his email.
Oh. [chuckles] Forgive me. I forgot.
See, this is why I much preferred life before the internet,
because we would have spoken on the phone, you would have recognized my voice
and known that this is our house.
I'm sorry?
This is our house. I'm the George you emailed back and forth with.
No, I-I remember the name, I just…
This is… this is your house?
Mm.
I'm sorry. You think we could come inside?
Oh, yeah. Hey, sure. Y-Yeah, come, come on in.
Yeah. Got cold out all of a sudden.
I understand how strange this must be for you.
Us, turning up like this unannounced.
We would have called, you see, but, uh… the phones are out.
Yeah, my phone doesn't seem to have service.
It's almost as if we're telling the truth.
[Clay] Uh…
[chuckles] Hey. I'm Clay.
-Ruth. -Hi.
-And I'm G.H., again. -G.H.
-Clay, nice to meet you. -Yeah.
Why don't we… sit down?
And you know, talk.
The children are sleeping.
I wouldn't worry too much about them.
I mean, Archie'd sleep through the atom bomb.
You know? [laughs] Let's go in the kitchen.
[G.H.] Tonight we were at the symphony in the Bronx. Have you been?
[Clay] Uh… No.
[G.H.] Their productions are in a class of their own.
[Ruth] He's on the board of the Philharmonic.
He likes to encourage everyone he knows to take an interest in classical music.
So in other words, I am one lucky daughter.
Do you mind if I get a glass of water?
Uh, no, no. Uh, help yourself.
[G.H.] Anyway, we were driving back to the city, home.
And then something happened.
A blackout.
-A blackout? -[G.H.] Mm.
The lights seem, seem to be working pretty good.
Um…
Exactly, right, so, um… we thought…
Well, with everything that's probably going on in the city right now,
we didn't--
We live on the 14th floor and he can't climb 14 flights because of his knee.
Plus the traffic lights went out.
We would have been sitting in a six hour parking lot if we'd headed home.
So there was a blackout and you decided to drive all the way out here?
These roads, they're familiar. I barely even thought about it.
So when we saw the lights go, I looked at Ruth--
And said that he would feel better if we stayed here.
You know, in his house. [slurps]
Wait. Y-You, you want to stay here? But… we're staying here.
Well, under the circumstances, we, we thought you might understand.
-Of course. Yeah. It's just-- -Uh…
I think what he means is, of course we understand--
I know it's a surprise, but we thought maybe if you let us stay--
Because, again…
You know, it is like…
-our house. -[awkward chuckle]
What she's trying to say is we wanted to be somewhere safe.
Well, you know, we're, we're on vacation.
Clay, Amanda, we could absolutely refund you your money.
You want us to leave?
I-It's the middle of the night. My, my children are sleeping upstairs.
You come in here and talk about refunding our money.
I-I think I need to call the company. I don't even think you can do this.
Um, there's got to be a number on their web--
Th-That's really not necessary.
Why not?
Because we're not saying you should leave.
We could refund you, say, 50% of what you paid.
You know, there's an in-law suite. We could stay downstairs.
Downstairs?
Fifty percent?
I think we need to look at the terms and conditions here. Uh…
A-All right, we need to find the, the Wi-Fi router.
-Okay, I'll try tethering it to my cell. -It needs to be reset.
All right, well, the phones aren't working, Clay.
How's that supposed to make a difference?
I think the internet is down anyway, so--
Okay, look. I'm… [sighs] I'm sorry.
I just, uh, I don't feel comfortable staying in a house with…
…people I don't know.
Uh, it's a blackout. I-It could be over in a couple of hours.
May I?
I should have listened to my wife and had these labeled already.
[softly] Yeah…
Ah… Here we are.
Yeah… I can give you a thousand dollars now for the night.
That should cover almost half of what you're paying for the weekend.
It's a thousand dollars.
We'll be very grateful.
Then tomorrow, we'll know a little more and…
-…we'll figure this all out. -Yeah.
Meanwhile this thing is not responding.
So anyway, I say one night, it's like--
I think we should discuss this privately.
You know, we're gonna go talk in the other room, all right?
Hmm.
-Say, you mind if I made myself a drink? -Oh, sure. Make yourself right at-- Um.
Yep.
[Amanda] Why did, why did you tell them they could stay?
[Clay] I mean, it's a blackout.
What, you, y-you think they're lying?
I mean, it's a young woman and her father, they look innocent enough.
They're strangers.
They introduced themselves.
They knocked on the door in the middle of the night.
Would you rather them burst in?
They scared the shit out of me.
Well, I think, you know, that they were scared too.
Right? I mean, they didn't know what else to do.
Well, here's an idea: go to a hotel.
This is their home as, you know, the girl kept reminding us.
Well, we didn't ask for any proof. I didn't hear their car. Did you?
No, but it's windy. Maybe we just didn't hear it.
Or maybe they snuck up the road.
Or, maybe we should calm down a little?
I'm sorry. I just--
This really doesn't seem like their house.
The board of the Philharmonic?
I don't know. It just all feels like a con to me.
They want to stay here? With us?
Forget it. I wouldn't be able to sleep with strangers in the house.
Rose is right down the hall. What if he sneaks in…
I don't want to think about it.
You don't think he'd want to molest Archie, though.
What are you talking about?
I'm just saying I don't like the way any of this sounds. Okay?
He came here because he doesn't want to climb a flight of fucking stairs?
Give me a break. All feels a little improvised.
God, what if it's a scam?
[stammering] What if the blackout and whatever
that's just all part of the story?
I don't think they made that up.
I mean, that's probably why the phones and the internet aren't working.
And besides, hey. He had the keys.
He opened up the liquor cabinet. Remember?
So what if he had the keys?
Maybe he's the handyman. She's the housekeeper.
The housekeeper always knows where the stash of money is.
And besides, he had his back to us. Maybe he broke into it.
I don't see what he has to gain by giving us a thousand bucks.
Why are you trying so hard to believe everyone except your own wife?
Something is happening and I don't trust them.
I think they are scared, nice people who need a place to spend the night.
All right, I'm going to go down there and I'm going to talk to them,
and if I get a bad vibe, I-I'm going to say, "No.
We're not comfortable with this arrangement."
Okay? But if things are cool, I say we let them stay.
I wish I had your faith in people.
My own signature cocktail. Happy to make you one.
Yeah, you know, I might have a drink.
Haven't touched this one yet, it's all yours.
Oh, thank you.
How about you, Amanda?
What's in it, exactly?
That is a heck of a cocktail.
You should try this, babe. I think you'd dig it.
I'll pass.
I think I need some fresh air.
Um…
You have a beautiful home.
We love it. Glad to hear you do, too.
-[liquid pours] -How long have you been here?
Oh… Bought it almost…
…twenty years ago now.
But, at this point, it's… it's home.
Or a home away from home.
We fixed it up about five years back. We had a great contractor.
-A lot of little details were his idea. -Hmm.
Whereabouts is your place in the city?
We are on Park between 81st and 82nd.
What about you?
Uh, Brooklyn. Sunset Park.
Well, it's actually Park Slope.
-Ah, very nice. -Mm-hmm.
That's where everyone wants to live these days. Affordable, too.
I think even Ruth looked over there
when she was thinking about flying the coop.
Where's your wife? I'm curious if you're worried about her in the city.
She's on a work trip in Morocco.
She's an art dealer so she travels a lot.
Her flight is due back here in the morning, actually.
Uh-huh.
Could I see your ID?
Oh, Amanda.
It's a fair ask.
You're a stranger showing up in the middle of the night
and my kids are upstairs.
Of course. I understand.
Mm, well. [chuckles]
You're not going to believe this but I…
left my wallet in my coat pocket, which I checked at the symphony.
In all the commotion, I must have forgotten it there.
You said you heard about the blackout while you were on your way home.
-[emergency alert blares] -[Amanda gasps]
[automated voice] This is a national emergency.
All radio stations and televisions will cease their programs during this alert.
This is a national emergency…
Well. Looks like you did the right thing getting out of the city.
-I'm sure it's a mess. -[automated voice stuttering]
Well, we're only talking about a blackout here.
-A blackout is not nothing. -[channels switching, alert continuing]
It could be something. The symptom of something bigger, like terrorism
or a bomb like the one that you said your son would sleep through.
Ruth.
…all radio stations and television networks will cease…
I think that you should stay here tonight.
…this is a national emergency…
Tomorrow, we'll sort through everything.
Things always look different by the light of day.
I guess self-help clichés are rooted in some truth, huh?
[Ruth] I can't believe we're staying in the basement.
What do we get to do tomorrow? Their laundry?
I'll take the floor. You take the bed.
We need to get them out of here.
We're not going to do that by scaring them.
They need to think everything's going to be okay.
Everything is going to be okay, isn't it?
What's going on? What are you thinking?
Your client didn't tell you anything else, did he?
There's no point in talking about this until we know more.
That's what I think.
This is a national emergency.
All radio stations and televisions will cease their programs during this alert.
This is a national emergency.
All radio stations and televisions will cease their programs during this alert.
She was fucking with us.
That girl. She was poking.
Don't take it so personal.
I don't think I can listen to much more of that snark.
Even if this does turn out to be their house.
Are we still on that?
Well, there is not one photo on the wall.
Not a wedding picture of the supposed art dealer wife on the business trip
or that spoiled brat as a baby. Think about it.
I'm sure they take them down when they rent the house for privacy concerns.
There's just something off about them.
Why didn't you say anything about what we saw at the beach today? That boat.
It was an oil tanker.
Well, why didn't you? Tell them, I mean.
I don't know. Just seemed like it was piling on.
Why didn't you?
I was afraid.
Afraid of what?
That it would confirm something.
All radio stations and televisions will cease their programs during this alert.
This is a national emergency.
All radio stations and televisions will cease their programs during this alert.
-This is a national… -[static]
[Rose] Mom.
Mom.
Mom.
Rosie. Rose.
Mom, two problems. One: I was literally about to start the Friends series finale,
but the internet on my iPad still isn't working.
I tried to watch it on the TV because I read somewhere that they--
What's it called when they used to play old things over and over again?
Reruns.
Why do they do that again?
I don't know, Rosie. We were really bored back then.
Anyway, th-there's something wrong with the TV. It's all messed up.
That's problem number two. Please fix this.
I have incredible anxiety about how they're going to wrap up the show.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too seriously?
This isn't fair. It's a vacation.
Dad said on vacation we can have as much screen time as we want.
Well. A: I did not say that.
And B: Daddy is still sleeping.
Just go wait in the living room. I'm coming.
Clay.
-[Clay grunts sleepily] -Get up. Look. Look.
-It doesn't say anything. -What?
-It was just there. -Mm, you sure? What did it say?
Yes, of course I'm sure.
There were four news alerts. Um…
Uh, two about the blackout and one that said, um…
hackers were behind the power outage.
-Hackers? -Yeah.
And then there was one that said, uh, "breaking" but then it was just gibberish.
No words, just random letters.
Maybe they hacked the cell network?
Is that-Is that a question?
Are you fucking asking me? How would I know?
Why are you being so nonplussed about all of this?
Did you forget those people are still in our house?
-I trusted you to handle this. -[sighs]
I'm gonna drive into town.
I'll go to the store, buy a newspaper,
find someone who knows more than we do.
All right? I will take care of this for us.
Whose car is that?
Looks expensive.
Let's get some breakfast.
Uh, so listen, honey. About that car.
Last night, these people…
…the Scotts. They had to come by.
There's been…
…um, they had a problem
and they weren't far from here. So they, they came here.
What are you even talking about?
I'll take some of that coffee.
Oh. I was just telling Rose about the Scotts.
-Dad, the TV isn't working. -Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, baby.
-Come on. -Dad, can you fix it?
Uh…
Yeah.
Um…
Well, now it's snow. Last night it was a blue screen.
-I wonder what that means. -What?
Yeah, see?
No. It's just- it's not working.
I'm aware. Can you like, reboot it or something?
-Or go up on the roof or whatever? -No one's going on the roof.
I am definitely not going up on the roof.
Okay? But I'm going to go to the store later
and maybe I can find something that will, you know, help.
You know, get one of those, uh, some rabbit ears or something.
Why would a rabbit's ear help?
Good morning.
You mind if I have some coffee?
Help yourself. You know where the mugs are, right?
I had news alerts on my phone this morning.
-Your phone is working? -No.
They must have come in overnight somehow, and then they disappeared.
What did they say?
There were two about the blackout and then something about hackers being behind it.
-Hackers? -Mm-hmm.
Where are the power plants in New York City?
I mean, they must be in Queens, I guess. Or-Or near the river?
Why are you asking about power plants?
Hackers can get into power plants.
That's probably how they caused the outage.
You remember that thing that happened in Jersey a few years back?
It nearly caused a meltdown.
Is that your daughter out there?
She's sweet. How old is she?
Thirteen, last month.
Hmm.
Still kind of a baby at heart.
If it's okay with you, I would like to keep what's going on between the adults.
The kids like the pool.
I'm just going to encourage them to do that until we know more.
I don't want them to panic over nothing.
I don't want to scare anyone but I disagree with you.
Disagree with me about what?
I don't think this is nothing.
So, what is it that you do?
Um…
I'm in advertising, on the client side. I manage relationships.
Huh. I would not have guessed that.
And what about your husband?
Uh, Clay is a professor at City College.
English and media studies.
You know, I've had plenty of friends major in media studies
but I never know what it means.
And you, what is it that you do?
Me, I'm… [chuckles]
I'm still figuring my shit out, trying not to rush into anything.
The last thing that I want is to be sucked into a career
that I regret ten years from now
by which point I will be trapped by the pressure to stay the course
because I'll be too old to re-enter the workforce. You know what I mean.
Morning. Any news?
Phone's still not working.
Looks like the TV's out. Where's Clay?
He went to the store to get a newspaper.
Or try to find someone to talk to, to see if they know what's going on.
Smart. I thought I'd go over to our neighbors house, the Huxleys.
-They only live a few miles down the road. -And you think they'll be home?
Unlikely.
You often see no one here around this time,
but I'll drive over anyway and check.
Before you go, you might want to hear about the alerts.
Alerts?
Oh, I had news alerts on my phone this morning.
Two of them were about the blackout
but then there was one that said something about maybe hackers were behind it.
Uh-huh.
What? Do you think there's going to be a meltdown, too?
-Is that what Ruth told you? -Among other horrifying things, yes.
Well, obviously Ruth is being a little paranoid.
Aren't you the one who always said,
"If you're not paranoid by now, it's probably too late"?
I'm sure this'll turn out to be a big nothing.
Like that Love You bug.
Is that coffee?
I-I'm sorry. What's a Love You bug?
Um, it was a computer worm.
Spread throughout the internet back in 2000.
People would get an email with the subject line that read "I love you."
You clicked on the attachment, it would send it to all your contacts.
It crippled businesses and caused billions of dollars in damages.
Turns out, it was just two teenagers in the Philippines.
Could be just as innocent as that.
I think I'll go rush Archie along.
I'm worried about Mom.
You think her flight is going to be okay?
Sure.
Matter of fact, I bet she's…
…been redirected to some airport in Ohio.
She's probably cursing out every customer service rep
till they put her on a plane home.
Do you remember that time the three of us went to Italy?
Yeah, I do.
What made you think of that?
I don't know what else to think about.
-[button beeping] -[static hissing]
[softly] Yeah.
♪ Oh, it's the winter of the wanted ♪
♪ Yeah, it's the hardest part of nature ♪
♪ Lord have mercy on this creature ♪
♪ Give me some heat I know you've got it ♪
Who'd Mom say these people were again?
What're you looking at?
[garbled voice] …we're now getting reports
that the fallout from the ongoing Cyber attack
has led to a catastrophic environmental disaster in the South,
impacting animal migration patterns--
Archie, I saw something this morning.
Deer.
They're everywhere, dumbass.
They're like squirrels or pigeons.
Who cares?
No, this was different. Like…
…they were trying to tell us something.
Let's see what else is out there.
Are you really that bored?
Is this because you can't watch your show?
I'm going.
Hello, anyone home? It's G.H. I let myself in.
Hello?
What's in that thing?
Let's open it and see.
-Yeah? Hey, hi. -Hello!
Okay, I-I don't understand what you're saying. I don't, I don't speak, um…
I don't speak Spanish.
This place is so fucking boring.
Yeah.
Maybe it's just where he sleeps, though.
Where he hides at night.
Who?
Whoever made that impression.
I-I don't, I don't know where I am. I'm trying to get to town.
No, no, I-I don't have any service either.
Listen, listen…
Look, he's, uh…
He's got this little window over here.
So he can see…
See what?
No, o-okay. Okay. I-I…
-[woman continues pleading] -[stammering]
Sorry.
Hey.
Isn't that the room you were sleeping in?
Shit…
Just imagine.
It's all dark out here.
Oh, my God.
Your little bedside lamp is glowing.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit!
He could just follow that light right up to you.
Oh, shit. [panicked yell]
-Ah! -[yelps]
That's not funny, Archie. That really hurt.
[laughing] You'll be fine.
No, I won't.
Dude, calm the fuck down. It was just a joke.
This morning I saw deer.
Not a deer, a fuck lot of deer. A hundred.
Maybe more. Right in the backyard.
It was really weird, Archie.
Do they go around in big groups like that?
Why the fuck would I know anything about deer?
If you're so worried about it, why don't you just ask Mom and Dad?
[scoffs] Like they would even care.
No one cares what I say.
That's probably true.
You going in?
No. You?
Seems like a hassle.
Why? Because of your hair, or…?
More like I don't trust that one of your kids didn't pee in the pool.
They wouldn't do that.
And yet, we really can't know, can we?
Your daughter watches that show?
"Watch" is far too weak of a word. More like worships.
Hmm.
What?
Don't get me wrong, I watched it too.
But it's almost… nostalgic for a time that never existed, you know?
I hope the kids didn't wander off too far.
[under breath] Fuck…
Archie.
Archie, look.
Will you please look?
[Archie] What?
We should go up there.
No. No, fuck that. I'm hungry. Come on, let's go.
Rose, let's go.
So…
You going to tell us why you're soaking wet?
I fell into the pool.
You fell into the… pool.
I tripped over something.
Yeah, I fell into the pool.
What were you doing near the pool? I thought you were looking for Rich.
Do you mind going to my study and getting me something to wear?
I'm afraid this is the only change of clothes I had downstairs.
I saw it, you know?
A while ago, before all this happened.
I looked at the market.
And I knew something was coming.
What do you mean?
In my line of work, you have to understand the patterns that govern the world.
You have to learn how to read the curve.
Spend as long as I have doing it, it can help you see the future.
It holds steady, it promises harmony.
It inches up or down, you know that means something.
G.H., why-why are you telling me this?
Did your neighbor say something to you?
No, he wasn't home.
But he has a satellite phone I thought could help us.
I tried to use it. It didn't work even though it had enough juice.
Now, the whole point of a satellite phone is that you always have a signal
if you have a clear view of the sky, which I did.
Only reason why it wouldn't work
is if our satellites got knocked out of commission.
Our satellites.
You think something happened to our satellites. The ones in space.
Satellites are networked to computers down here.
Mm…
So you think that the hackers or whatever knocked out our satellites?
Don't you think you're maybe getting a little carried away?
I mean, maybe you just didn't use the phone right.
I saw a plane nosedive out of the sky into the ocean.
And it wasn't the first.
I no longer think that this is just a couple of teenagers in the Philippines.
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Where are my kids?
[Rose] Mommy.
Where's Dad?
He'll be back soon.
Why are you wet?
I should have covered my ears sooner.
Now my head feels weird.
That's probably normal. It was really loud.
Was it like a, um, like a-a plane breaking the sound barrier?
Or whatever that-- a sonic boom. Was, was that a sonic boom?
Planes don't usually break the sound barrier.
The Concorde doesn't fly anymore.
Maybe it was a plane that we don't know about.
Archie, why don't you go get changed.
[Ruth] Rose, maybe you should too.
That's a good idea.
Why don't you go cuddle up in Mommy's bed and read that book Dad got you.
We're, um, we're going to be okay, right?
Yeah.
Since you're the one with the crystal ball, what was that?
Was that a bomb? A missile?
Could have been a power plant explosion.
We don't know anything for certain yet.
You seemed pretty certain a minute ago with your fucking haunting soliloquy.
Nothing's changed.
Nothing's changed?
Everything has changed.
And we're sitting here like… like I don't know what.
Is-Is this what sitting ducks are? Ducks sitting and waiting to be shot?
I meant nothing has changed in terms of what we do.
We wait for Clay to come back and we see what he's learned.
Should I drive to town and look for him?
We should fill the bathtubs full of water.
Is there enough batteries, and Tylenol, and food, and the generator,
and one of those hand crank radios,
and a straw that makes it safe to drink dirty water.
I think we shouldn't do anything until Clay comes back.
What if he's not coming back?
Okay, my dad is right.
We're safe here. We should just sit tight.
How do you know that we're safe
when you don't know what the fuck is happening to us?
Maybe it was like, what was that? Ten Mile Island?
There are power plants here, aren't there?
-Three Mile Island. -Why are you obsessed with power plants?
Hey, you're right. We shouldn't speculate.
Stop saying that!
I just want you to fucking tell me what you're thinking.
There's the blackout and then you see the planes crashing and…
What?
What? She's an adult.
You cannot protect her, just like you cannot protect me right now.
The satellite phone not working and then that noise, and then what?
What happens next in that sequence?
Everything I know I have told you.
I don't believe you.
I haven't believed you since you walked through that front door.
Golly. I wonder what it is about us that makes you so mistrustful.
Ruth…
You always think you know what you're talking about, don't you?
Well, ain't that the pot calling the kettle black?
Ruth.
He knew.
At the market in town yesterday,
there was a guy in the parking lot.
He bought cases of water and canned goods.
He knew this was going to happen.
Bearded guy?
Probably wearing an old Cowboys hat.
That's Danny.
He's the contractor I was telling you about.
The one who worked on the house.
I wouldn't read into it.
He's a self-proclaimed survivalist.
That shopping list was probably a typical weekend for him.
Jesus Christ.
I'm here. I'm okay, are you okay? Where are the kids?
-Everyone's here, everyone's okay. -Okay.
What happened? Did you get to town?
Uh… Uh…
I didn't get far. And then I heard that noise.
What do you mean? Where have you been?
What were you doing? I was going crazy.
I don't know, I-I just started to drive,
and then I heard that noise, and I came right back.
So you didn't see anyone that might help us figure out what's happening here.
No, I did not see anyone.
But I did see something. I saw--
Um, I, uh--
It was this huge, um, drone.
You know, flying in the middle of nowhere, dropping off thousands of these.
I have no idea what it says.
"Death to America."
What?
"Death to America."
I mean, I don't know what the rest of this means,
but this part, it definitely means "Death to America."
I remember from a game I was playing.
Nothing about this makes sense.
If they were attacking us, why would they advertise it like this?
It's not even in English. What's the point of dropping these things here?
I'm pretty sure I make that first right,
then it's a straight shot to the expressway?
With what we know, the city would be the worst place for you to go.
We're not going to the city. We're going to my sister's in Jersey.
But to get to New Jersey from here, you have to drive through the city.
But to be clear, I make a right, follow signs to the Expressway.
Yes, exactly like how you got here. But listen to me, please.
This is dangerous what you're doing, for you and your family.
Dad.
Let them go.
I really appreciate you taking care of us, I do.
We have to do what's right for our family.
This is in everyone's best interest.
This is for the better.
For who?
For us.
I don't want to have to agree with that woman, but she was right.
And you really should've told me what you saw.
Hey, I know what you're thinking,
but I'm certain your mother's plane wouldn't be flying over here.
It wasn't the same airline.
Is she gone?
Oh, come on now. Why are you even going there?
I just told you, it wasn't even the same airline.
Yeah, but does it feel like she's gone?
[voice shaking] Because it does to me.
If we hit traffic, at least we'll be able to talk to people,
see if anyone has information about what's going on.
It's crazy we haven't seen anyone.
I'm sure we will see someone as soon as we hit the Expressway.
[Amanda] Phones could work in New Jersey.
The truth is we don't know anything that's going on outside of Long Island.
They could have internet, the phone lines could be okay.
We'll look back on this one day and laugh, I guarantee you.
The vacation from Hell. [chuckles]
Things get funnier with time. Isn't that what they say?
I think they say it a little differently.
But, you know, I know what you mean.
Sirens.
I thought you were napping, honey.
[Rose] I can't.
Why not?
Because of the sirens.
What is that?
You stay with the kids. I'm gonna go take a look.
You know what, you guys, sit--
Sit tight, okay?
See anyone?
There's nobody here.
They're all brand new.
What?
Oh, wow. Hey, someone's coming.
Yo!
Clay!
-Clay, get in the car! -Wait, shouldn't we wait and talk to them?
-Get in the fucking car right now! -All right, all right.
What are you doing? Shouldn't we flag them down?
-Maybe they know something. -There's no one in that car!
Mom? Mom, on your left, there's a car! Go, go, go, go!
-[Amanda screams] -[car scrapes]
What if we went to a shelter?
Does the military have a bomb shelter or a base around here?
I mean, don't they have to have those things ready for…
…emergencies like these?
I don't know where they are.
Even if I did, you said all those cars came off the lot.
If they did that to every dealership, the main roads are most likely clogged up.
We stay here till we know more.
How much more do we need to know?
We're probably in the middle of a war zone.
People we know are likely dead.
Ruth.
Just--
We just need to make a plan.
We can't sit here and do nothing. We need to go somewhere.
He's right, Amanda. It's too dangerous.
We stay here tonight, and then in the morning, maybe--
-Maybe what? -Maybe-- I don't know.
I was so close.
What are you doing?
Filling up the tub.
That's what they say to do for,
you know, water.
Do you vape?
Not really.
I mean, is that-- That's like, marijuana?
I mean, I know they got different kinds now, like fruit flavors or--
Like marijuana.
Have you ever fucked one of your students?
I can't believe you just asked me that.
I mean, is that what I look like to you? I look like that kind of guy?
You look like the kind of guy to whom things come easy.
Especially women.
Well, I'll take that as a compliment, I guess. Hmm?
I always thought of myself as a sophisticated man.
Someone who had seen the world for what it was.
But I have never seen anything like this.
So now, I wonder if that thing I always thought about myself was a delusion.
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.
You dig deep enough, it's probably all a delusion.
I mean, take your line of work, for example.
Imaginary numbers,
moving around imaginary money, leading to imaginary success.
Personally, I think my business is a lot less complicated than all that.
At its most basic, my work is and always has been about people.
-I'm real sorry for you then. -And why is that?
Because people are terrible.
I mean, fuck. Look at the way I treated you.
And now we are enjoying a drink together.
I am sorry, by the way.
For what I said, did, thought, it doesn't matter.
I was wrong and I'm sorry.
Some of my smartest clients have lost a lot of money
because they based their choices on preconceived beliefs instead of truth.
Seeing the difference is one of the hardest things a person can do.
When they don't and you do, gotta be maddening.
Depending on the person,
I might take a little satisfaction in watching the market punish them.
The scary ones, though, are the ones who don't learn.
Even after they lose lots, and I mean lots, of money.
Nothing frightens me more than a person unwilling to learn,
even at their own expense.
That's a darkness I will never understand.
The quiet is so noisy.
It's one of the first things I noticed when we started spending nights here.
Found it hard to sleep.
Not like at home, where you hear everything.
Sirens, traffic, people.
I miss that.
Which, the sirens or the people?
I am starting to like you,
and that is a bold statement coming from me because…
I can't remember the last time I liked anybody.
I have to say, I found you very prickly at the outset,
but you've grown on me.
Why did you really come here?
And don't tell me it's because of your knee.
That wasn't a lie. I did have a knee surgery.
Twisted it up pretty bad playing ball down at the Y.
But it's not why you came here.
Why I came here involves something that happened to me a few years back.
One of my clients invited me and my wife to a private event.
My client, he…
Well.
I won't say his name, but you'd recognize it though.
-Is he a celebrity? -Oh, no. Nothing like that.
But in the business world, he's one of the biggest out there.
He deals mostly in defense contracting.
I'm talking hush-hush, top-secret money from the Pentagon.
Perhaps the most powerful person I've ever had a meal with.
Anyway, we're at this soiree at his house.
It's getting late. My wife, she wants to go.
But he and I are just having a blast, and he doesn't want the night to end.
After a few more glares,
my wife agrees to take a cab and I'll come home after.
Mm, I bet she was real happy about that.
So, we're having a few more drinks, getting really sauced, and at one point,
I don't think he could stand and I was pretty wobbly, myself.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
So he takes me to his study.
Smoke a few cigars
and we're sort of flying high, laughing at almost everything.
Eventually he starts in on how much he likes me,
and how he wishes he could invite me on this trip he's about to go on.
What kind of trip? Where is he going?
That's exactly what I asked.
Then he…
turns to me,
serious face.
And he says…
"Oh, you know,
"just my annual meeting
with the rest of the evil cabal that runs the world."
He was the kind of guy that was always known for jokes like that.
Again, if I told you his name, you would understand.
Well, I just have to take your word for it.
And now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna top off my wine.
Then yesterday, before the symphony,
my friend calls me up.
No scheduled appointment, like he usually does.
Just calls me out of the blue
and wants me to move around some of his money.
And we're talking some big numbers, even for him.
And as we're getting off the phone, I asked if he wanted to grab a drink.
He tells me he's going away for a while.
And I joke back to him,
"Oh, yeah? You hanging with your evil cabal this weekend?
I thought that was only during the winter solstice."
But he doesn't laugh.
And he always laughs, even with bad jokes.
All he said was…
"Take care of yourself."
Almost as if he felt sorry for me.
Ever since, I haven't been able to get it out of my head.
Are you saying that--
Are you thinking that your friend is somehow behind what's happening here?
No, nothing like that.
A conspiracy theory about a shadowy group of people running the world
is far too lazy of an explanation.
Especially when the truth is much scarier.
What is the truth?
No one is in control.
No one is pulling the strings.
Sure, there are those like my friend
who might have the right kind of access to the right kind of information.
But when events like this happen in the world,
the best, even the most powerful people can hope for
is a heads up.
Sorry, this…
Guess this story's kind of a buzzkill.
Changed my mind. I don't think I like you anymore.
Come on.
Let's go.
Where are we going?
I'm gonna win you over again.
[Archie] I see you, Rose.
What do you want?
I'm never going to find out what happens to Ross and Rachel, am I?
You're still on this shit?
Who gives a fuck?
Well, I do. Obviously.
Why do you care so much about that show anyway?
[swallows] They make me happy.
I really need that right now. Don't you?
If there's any hope left in this fucked up world,
I wanna at least find out how things turn out for them.
I care about them.
Maybe you shouldn't.
I'm just saying.
You're probably right, the way things are going
you're not gonna see that show ever again.
So if I were you, I'd find something else to care about.
[Ruth] It's weird, we're not hearing any cicadas tonight.
I got lost today.
When I went out this morning.
What do you mean you got lost?
Well,
I thought I knew where I was going
but then there were all these streets that didn't have any signs anywhere.
So I just drove around.
Then I drove around some more.
And then, you know, I turn around, and then I got just completely lost,
and I have no idea how I found my way back here, to be honest.
But I did see someone.
A woman.
On the road.
She waved me down and, um,
she was speaking Spanish.
She was just standing there
by the side of the road in the middle of nowhere.
[voice shaking] And I…
I left her.
She needed help.
And I left her.
Well, is there anything else that you're keeping from us?
Since you're opening up, that is.
Well, we didn't tell you before that we saw an oil tanker ground.
Like, right up on the beach.
An oil tanker?
Yeah, it's like a really big boat.
You know, it's red.
I mean, well, I don't think that they're all red,
but this one was, and it came right up on the beach.
Why didn't you tell us?
Well, I think at the time we were both scared, you know?
About what it could mean.
Well, what could it mean?
Well, if we were being attacked,
which I know sounds weird to say, but oil is something
that you would want a lot of
if, you know, we're going to defend ourselves.
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
I really think we're gonna be all right.
You know, I mean, in the end, I really do.
I mean, even if it is like, an invasion.
An invasion?
Well, or an occupation?
Okay, dude, you know what? I know that you mean well,
but your word choices are, like, freaking me the fuck out.
What was that?
Those are… flamingos.
Those are flamingos?
Those are flamingos.
Why?
Wow, this is an impressive collection.
You like jazz?
You want to listen to jazz?
Sure, why not?
Because I thought we were going to have some fun.
Let's have something we could dance to.
You can dance to jazz.
In fact, when I bought my first record, that was--
Oh, please not another one of your stories.
They end up leaving me severely disturbed. Wait. What are these records?
Don't look over there. Those are my daughter's records.
She had a DJ phase in college.
Now this looks like something a lady can properly dance to.
Oh, come on. That's not what I brought you in here for.
You said you wanted to win me over.

Amanda, we gotta start seeing this for what it is.
-♪ Oh, you're dancing real close ♪ -♪ Oh, yeah ♪
There is no going back to normal.
Don't say that. We have to--
[both gasp] [Clay] Ahh!
Is he okay?
[Amanda] Mm.
He's a little warm, but I think he'll be fine.
What are you still doing up?
I keep thinking about this one West Wing episode.
There's this story, someone tells the president--
You watched The West Wing?
Only the Aaron Sorkin seasons.
Anyway, the story was about a man who lived by the river.
And he hears on the radio that the river is going to flood the town
and everyone should leave.
But the man doesn't go anywhere because he prays every day.
He knows that God loves him and will save him.
But then the flood actually happens.
And this guy in a rowboat sees the man
and says, "Hey, come on, I can save you."
But the man tells him he isn't going anywhere.
Then the helicopter comes flying by, and the pilot lowers the ladder,
but the man tells him he isn't going anywhere.
After that, the man drowns in the flood.
And so he goes up to heaven and he's really angry at God,
and he tells him, "I prayed to you every day.
I thought you loved me. Why didn't you save me?"
And God says,
"I sent you a radio report,
a rowboat and a helicopter.
What more do you want?"
What's this about, Rose?
I think I'm done waiting.
-Dad? -Hmm?
Will you sleep in the bed with me?
Not sure.
The bed's not big, and I don't mind sleeping on the floor.
-It's sometimes good for my back. -I'm scared.
It's just us now, isn't it?
What do you mean by that?
What I mean is,
if the shit goes down,
do you trust these people that are in our house?
We already know the wife has no chill.
That boy was sneaking pictures of me by the pool.
That little girl keeps staring into the woods like Donnie Darko,
and I'm pretty sure the husband wants to fuck me.
How do you know that?
He's not actually going to do anything, he's not "that guy."
But did he want to? Abso-fucking-lutely.
My point remains, I don't trust them.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, if that's what you're asking.
I'm asking for you to remember that if the world falls apart,
trust should not be doled out easily to anyone,
especially white people.
Even mom would agree with me on that.
I got it.
Do you?
Because we're sleeping in the basement of our own house
for the second night in a row.
Just what exactly was the point of letting them back into the house?
It was the right thing to do.
And that right there. That's what's going to fuck us in the end.
[Clay] Drink up.
Where's Rosie?
I don't know. She got up before us.
I'm gonna have a look around. You should get up.
How are you feeling, baby?
Come on.
I know you're sleepy but I need you to get up
so I can get a look at you and take your temperature.
You were pretty warm last night.
Well, you're not so warm now.
Yay.
Does your throat hurt?
-No. -Good.
What is that? Blood, is that blood?
What are you--
What are you--
What are you fucking doing?
What the fuck? Are those your teeth?
Archie.
Stop doing that. Clay!
My teeth.
[Amanda] Clay!
What's happening to me?
[Amanda] Clay!
[Clay] Is everything okay?
-Something's wrong with Archie. -What is it? What the fuck?
-That's exactly what I said. -My teeth just, they felt weird.
And I touched them, and they just they fell out.
He was a little warm last night but this, I don't know.
Okay, all right. Well you-- you're okay.
I don't feel okay.
How are you feeling?
Besides your teeth falling out, I mean.
What kind of question is that? He's obviously sick.
I'm not sick, Mom. My teeth just fell out.
Maybe it was the bug that bit me. I don't know.
What bug?
A bug bit me yesterday in the woods.
[G.H.] That must be it, then.
Probably just a tick, Lyme disease. I've seen stranger symptoms.
Stranger than this?
He needs to go to the emergency room.
We need to go to the hospital.
We can't. The expressway's the only way out of town.
Besides, if the roads are jammed, no one would be there to help us anyway.
Well, we have to do something. Archie needs to see a doctor.
[sighs] I can't believe this is happening.
I can't believe this is happening.
We'll go to my contractor's house. He's not that far from here.
You said you saw him stocking up on supplies?
If I know Danny, he's prepared for anything.
He might have something useful.
Antibiotics, medicine.
Danny'll know what to do.
Hey.
I promise you, I'll get your son some help.
Where's Rose?
I couldn't find her.
What? What does that mean?
I looked all over the house. She's not here.
-She's not in the backyard. -I'll look downstairs.
She's probably exploring the house.
She might be playing outside. I'll look out for her.
I looked there but feel free to check again.
I don't understand. Where is she?
-She has to be here somewhere. -No, she's not!
I'm telling you, I have looked everywhere and she's not here.
-Well, she should be in the garage. -I already looked in the garage.
Okay. Where the fuck haven't you looked, Clay?
She's not down there.
Okay, this is insane. Where is she?
She wasn't outside,
but I think she may have taken one of the bikes from the garage.
Took one of the bikes? Where would she go?
Do you have any idea where your sister might be, bud?
I don't know.
Um, we were out by the shed yesterday, so--
The shed? What shed?
The-- the shed.
Um, she-- she saw some deer and she wanted to go look for them.
-So maybe there. I don't know. -Okay, I'm going.
-[Archie retches] -Archie, you all right?
-[Archie grunts and moans] -Are you all right--
-[G.H.] He needs help now. -[Clay] Yeah, okay.
-Okay, I got you. -[Ruth] I'm coming with you.
[G.H.] No, it's not safe.
Stay here with Amanda. Find Rose.
No. What? You can't leave me here by myself.
-It'll be okay. -Dad, we talked about this.
You cannot leave me here by myself.
-He's sick, don't you see that? -Dad, you will never come back.
Don't you see that something is happening?
It is happening right now.
Whatever it is, it's happening to Archie, it's happening to all of us.
You can't leave. The world could be ending out there.
That's why I want you here.
Take out your phone.
Come on, take it out.
Set a timer, one hour.
I'll be back.
It won't work.
It won't work out.
It will, there's no choice.
Look, I'll be back for you before this goes off.
One hour. That's what you get. You've promised.
[echoing] Rose? Rose!
Rosie! Rose!
[Amanda] This is a nightmare.
This is a goddamn nightmare.
Where would Rose have gone? Why would she leave?
She said she was done waiting. What did she mean?
What if we just went back to the house and we waited for my dad to get back?
And then what?
He'll find Rose?
I don't know, but he will help us.
I just want to know what the fuck is happening.
I want to know what the fuck is the plan.
I want to know that we can find my kid and then get in your fucking expensive car
and drive to an actual hospital, find a doctor who will tell me
that my baby is okay, that we're all gonna be okay,
and then we can just all go back to our house.
What if that's not possible?
I want to get the fuck away from here, and you, and whatever is happening.
It's happening to all of us.
I know that it is happening to all of us!
Stop yelling at me!
You don't care.
You don't care that I'm here.
And my mom is probably at the bottom of some ocean.
I don't have anyone else in my life.
I have nothing to go home to but them. Do you understand that?
And I need my mom more than ever.
And I will probably never see her again.
I care, I do.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do about that, but I do care.
Why are you like this?
What do you get out of being so angry all the time?
Every day, all day, my job-- my whole job is to…
…understand people well enough so that I know how to lie to them,
so I can sell them things they don't really want.
And when you study people like that,
when you really see the way they treat each other, well…
You're no dummy.
You see what they do, and they do it without even thinking about it.
Fuck. I did it to you and your dad, and I don't even really know why.
We fuck each other over
all the time, without even realizing it.
We fuck every living thing on this planet over and think it'll be fine
because we use paper straws and order the free range chicken.
And the sick thing is, I think deep down we know we're not fooling anyone.
I think we know we're living a lie.
An agreed upon mass delusion
to help us ignore and keep ignoring how awful we really are.
I'm not down with most of the things that you do and say, but…
…this is the part of the Venn diagram where we overlap.
I agree with everything you just said.
But as awful as people might be…
…nothing's gonna change the fact that we are all we've got.
I don't want to be this way.
I hate being terrible like this.
And I know I say I hate people, but I…
I'd do anything to have them back.
[Archie] Hey, Dad.
Do you think Taylor's okay?
Who?
Archie, you stay here.
Let's go.
George.
Danny. Sorry to bother you at home like this.
I'm gonna need you and your comrade to step off the porch
and stand by your vehicle.
What?
Off the porch and by your vehicle.
What can I do for you?
We're just checking on you.
Seeing if you're here, if you're okay.
If you heard anything about what's going on.
Yeah, I'm Clay.
My family rented G.H.'s-- George's home, you know.
We're from the city.
Well, that's a lucky break for your family.
Imagine what a shit show the city must be right now.
I got to be honest with you, I'm surprised you guys are even out.
We came out here because my son needs help.
He's vomiting. He's--
He's lost his teeth. They just fell out. Can't explain it.
Oh. His teeth, huh?
Well, it's gotta have something to do with that noise.
You know something about the noise?
Well, it's not all that dissimilar to what happened in Cuba a while back.
Microwave weapons, they call it, produces a kind of radiation
that can be beamed out through sound.
Some people lost their teeth there too.
Outside of that, the only thing I know for sure is
there's not a lot of information getting out, so…
I assume it's a war.
The beginning of one, anyways.
They've been saying there was chatter.
This has to be what they were chattering about.
Chatter, what do you mean, "chatter"?
You got to read the papers deeper than page one.
The Russians recalled their staff from Washington.
Did you even notice that?
Something is afoot. Now, what that is exactly, I don't know.
Maybe this is as much as we're ever going to know.
Maybe we just need to sit tight, be safe.
Pray. Whatever works for you.
Well, Danny.
It's like Clay said, his son isn't well.
We're gonna need more than just prayers.
And knowing how primed you are for these kind of situations,
we're thinking you might have some medicine that'd be able to help him.
What I got isn't your business.
Danny.
Come on now, it's me. We know each other.
We're friends.
That's the old way, George. You're not thinking clearly.
Danny, what are you saying?
You're telling this man not to take care of his son?
Nothing makes a whole lot of sense right now.
When the world doesn't make any sense, I can still do what's rational,
which is protect my own.
What you do is your business.
I thought I was doing the right thing by bringing them here.
Now if you have some medicine that can help him--
We can pay.
Um, a-- a--
Say, a thousand dollars?
Cash might not mean much if the government falls.
Well, the whole network's down. My credit cards aren't going to work.
There's no Venmo or ApplePay.
I mean, cash might be the only thing that means something.
My son's really sick. He needs your help. He's 16 years old.
Nothing's here.
Rosie.
[Danny] You're in a difficult position.
I get it.
I would do anything I had to for my family.
So that's what I'm doing.
I'm locking the doors. I'm waiting, I'm watching,
I'm getting out my gun.
Other than that, I don't have any answers for you.
Ruth, it's bike tracks--
I'm going to go back inside my house now.
I'm gonna say goodbye and good luck.
You come out again, you're welcome to stop by,
but I can't offer you much more than conversation.
I suggest you try your neighbors, the Thornes.
They did a basement conversion
on the down-low a while back, no permits or nothing.
A buddy of mine worked on it. He wouldn't even show me the plans.
Now, you ask me?
That's rich asshole talk for doomsday bunker.
Come on, Danny. You can't desert us like this.
Haven't you been picking up on what's going on out there, George?
We've all been deserted.
[Danny] All due respect.
I would like all of you off of my property.
Now.
We're not going anywhere till you give us what we need.
[Clay yelling] What the fuck is going on right now?
I promised this boy's mother I'd get him some help.
The only thing you're helping him to is a quick death
-unless you lower your weapons. -G.H., put the gun down.
-We'll find another way to the hospital. -There is no other way!
Besides, he's not gonna shoot us.
Uh… It sounds like he's gonna shoot us.
-I'm telling you he's bluffing. -The fuck I am.
Hold-- Hold on! Hold on!
-Clay, get out of the way! -Dad!
I'm trying to reason with him!
The only way this ends
is if you get back in your vehicle and drive away now.
Drive away to what? All the roads are blocked.
We're in the middle of God-knows-where. There's no one else around.
I have no idea what I am supposed to do right now.
I can barely do anything without my cell phone and my GPS.
I am a useless man.
But my son is sick.
And my daughter is missing.
And I don't know what to do.
But you are a very prepared man.
Fuck yeah, I am.
That's right, that's why we came to you,
because you're the only one who can help my son.
-Not my problem. -No, you're right. It's not.
But it's like you said, right?
What would you do if it was your family? That's what I'm doing.
It's the only thing I can do.
I am begging you.
Please.
Please help my son.
I guess an old fashioned barter system was to be expected at some point.
It's still cash, so it's not really a barter system.
[Danny] Hey, I got another tidbit for you.
Free of charge, if you want it.
It's the Koreans behind all this.
Koreans?
What makes you say that?
Just trust me. It's the Koreans.
Or the Chinese. One of them.
Show him.
I was driving around yesterday.
There's a big drone dropping these everywhere.
It means "Death to America," so we're thinking Iranians.
I remember hearing something on NPR once about their cyber capabilities.
Why is that funny?
Before the phones went out,
I heard from a friend of mine in San Diego about a similar event,
drones dropping pamphlets except they were in Korean.
Or Mandarin. Like I said, he couldn't tell which.
But seeing as he did four tours in Iraq,
he sure as shit would have known if it looked like that.
We made a lot of enemies around the world.
Maybe all this means is a few of them teamed up.
I saw flamingos in our pool last night.
The animals, they're trying to warn us.
They know something.
They know something that we don't.
It's like when dogs know storms are coming.
There's more bike tracks up ahead.
We should go back to the house. My dad is probably there.
Maybe he can help… us.
I'm not going anywhere without Rosie.
That house. That's gotta be where she went.
All right, let's go back and see if they found Rose.
G.H., what's going on?
Before we go…
I need to know that you're on the level with me.
No matter how far this thing goes, I need to know that we're good
because if what just happened here is happening everywhere,
we need to get to that bunker Danny told us about,
and we need to get there now.
What are you talking about?
You know something.
I had a sneaking suspicion, but I wanted more information first.
All signs were there, sure, but I…
I didn't want to scare anyone.
You'd have called me crazy because it is crazy.
It would have made more sense if we were on the brink of an all-out invasion,
but this…
I didn't think we'd actually let something like this happen.
I thought we were smarter than that.
Let what happen?
Because my primary client works in the defense sector,
I spend a lot of time studying the cost benefit analysis of military campaigns.
There was one program in particular that terrified my client the most.
A simple three-stage maneuver that could topple a country's government from within.
The first stage is isolation.
Disable their communication and transportation.
Make the target as deaf, dumb and paralyzed as possible,
setting them up for the second stage.
Synchronized chaos.
Terrorize them with covert attacks and misinformation,
overwhelming their defense capabilities
leaving their weapon systems vulnerable to extremists and their own military.
Without a clear enemy or motive, people would start turning on each other.
If done successfully, the third stage would happen on its own.
What's the third stage?
Coup d'état.
Civil war.
Collapse.
This program was considered the most cost-effective way
to destabilize a country.
Because if the target nation was dysfunctional enough,
it would, in essence, do the work for you.
Whoever started this wants us to finish it.

-Put your fucking hands up right now. -I didn't do nothing.
Well, look at him. He's not responsive right now, bro.
-Okay? -[woman] Okay.
[Tera] Okay.
[reporter 1] He's been called the African-American Family Emergency Plan.
[reporter 2] Has represented the families of Black men and women killed by the police.
[reporter 3] Several multimillion-dollar lawsuits.
[reporter 4] A familiar name is once again representing the family.
Renowned civil rights attorney, Ben Crump.
[Ben] My law firm gets about 500 calls a day.
People seek me out because they want a Black lawyer,
somebody who understands their life experiences,
somebody they feel they can trust.
We take on environmental injustice cases.
We take on banking discrimination cases, employment cases.
We go out and try to even the playing field.
[Ben] I've been a trial lawyer now for 25 years.
Everything in my career
led me to the George Floyd case…
one of the seminal cases in civil rights.
Those charges were raised on the one officer.
The others were arrested.
Is the family satisfied now? What are we looking for?
Well, the family is relieved with the arrest, but they want a conviction.
We can't get excited just because they're arrested. We've been down that road before.
[Ben] This was the opportunity that George Floyd gave us this moment.
An international case
that impacted societies all across the world.
[man on video call] My brother, Benjamin Crump. Uh… Brother Crump, how are you feeling today?
[Ben] I saw a diverse audience.
That meant that we really was looking at George Floyd not as just a Black man
but as a human being,
which those police officers never did
when they had their knee on his neck for nine minutes, while he kept saying, "I can't breathe."
It was a documentary of his death.
He literally said at the end, "I'm gone now."
[Ben] You had America's complete undivided attention.
We could not squander this moment to help move America forward.
With that police officer's knee on his neck,
while he said, "I can't breathe," and called for his mother.
-We got how many chairs? -[man] We got… We… About four.
Okay, I'm told we have four already in there.
-[man] Sounds good. -Well, we're gonna take these last two.
[announcer] Boys, 15 and 16, please report to the long-jump area.
Boys, 15 and 16 division, please report to the long-jump area.
Daddy, can I have some punch?
[Ben] Would you like ice?
[Ben] I've been married to my wife, Genae, for 22 years.
We met in college.
We have one daughter named Brooklyn.
[Ben] We have a close-knit, large, Southern family.
My mom lives down the street,
and my brothers live right around the corner.
[man on phone] It was 15 shots.
I mean, the people are rioting right now. I mean, this is happening right now.
Do you know if they shot him in the back? Or they shot him where?
[man] I don't know if he was shot in the back.
It just happened like an hour, maybe like two hours at the most--
I'm on it. Detroit police shooting. Okay.
It never stops.
[man 1 on phone] The prosecutor in charge of, uh, prosecuting
any federal claims against the officer had reached out
about whether or not we'd be willing to share our preliminary autopsy results.
[man 2] Why don't you wait till Monday until we hear where the press conference is gonna be, and where we're gonna stay and everything.
where the press conference is gonna be, and where we're gonna stay and everything.
[Ben] Then we'll get a judge to sign the order. [man 2] For sure.
And-- And my suggestion is we go in front of the federal courthouse
and do the press conference, but you know.
Unless, uh, you all can think of a better place.
-[man 1] That's nice. -[man 2] I think that's a good plan. Yeah.
[woman on phone] Hi, Attorney Crump there? They're ready in, like, one minute.
Okay.
This one?
You gonna merge me in?
-[woman] Yeah. Uh, are you ready now? -I'm ready.
-[woman] Okay. -This, this one.
-This one. This one. -Which one is it?
[Ben] The police, for hundreds of years, have killed Black people
and not had any financial accountability whatsoever.
I want to make it financially unsustainable
for them to continue to kill Black people unjustly.
[officer] Put your fucking hands out to the side. Hands out to the side now!
[news anchor] This morning, a family's heartbreak after 47-year-old Andre Hill was fatally shot
after 47-year-old Andre Hill was fatally shot by a Columbus, Ohio, police officer.
by a Columbus, Ohio, police officer.
Police body-camera video shows Hill approaching an officer
who responded to a non-emergency call early Tuesday morning.
You can see him holding a cell phone in his left hand.
His right hand was not visible.
[Ben] There are a lot of cases on video now,
but if you don't have somebody who can orchestrate everything,
it just becomes one of the 1,200 to 1,300 people
that the police kill every year in America that nobody remembers their name,
except their family.
[woman] Thank you for representing my dad.
[Ben] I truly appreciate it. Absolutely.
Everybody say your brother was a great guy.
I ain't heard no negative stuff about him. -Not that type of person. -You won't.
You know, my dad, he was the one who kept everybody together, you know?
He was the one with the most energy in the room for everybody.
[Ben] And-- And that's what I got from all of y'all,
that he was the person who everybody kind of turned to for uplift.
We need that officer to be charged and arrested.
If y'all will allow me to,
I'm gonna try to keep setting y'all for interviews. Number one.
And it's gonna get emotional, Karissa.
If you… You get to the point where you need a break, just let us know.
But we pushing for your daddy, 'cause, like you told me,
But we pushing for your daddy, 'cause, like you told me, he would be doing the same thing for you.
Y'all have to do enough interviews where people can see Andre Hill,
where it's in the conscious of American society.
We'll talk more about the funeral, and so forth, finding the church,
finding what he's going to wear and all that stuff, uh…
[Karissa] I actually know what I want him to wear,
the same suit that he wore at my aunt Shawna's wedding.
It was his first suit. I took him to pick it up in.
He was so happy. I just remember his smile.
And I want him to wear that suit
because that meant so much to him for so many different reasons.
-He was so exci… He was… Yeah, he… -[laughs]
And he walked you down the aisle? He walked me down the aisle. He walked me down the aisle.
The connections he made with people, you know,
it don't matter if he met you for five minutes
or you'd known him as long as I have, 22 years.
-You knew him. You was his best friend? -Yeah.
We met through a mutual friend and then, you know, we just clicked from day one.
You know, we started playing chess that day.
-[Ben] Oh, y'all been playing chess? -Yeah.
[Ben] Hey, please say that. They don't think Black people play chess.
-[woman] Oh, he loves chess. -So please say that.
Hold just one second, hold on one second.
The other thing, y'all, he loved life.
If somebody can bring that out, that he loved life, he loved people.
You know, this was a person who inspired others.
I mean, they got to feel that, y'all.
I don't ever want y'all to not show y'all righteous anger.
If you want justice, you got to go just expose your heart.
He might would've spent his Christmas with us.
-Yeah. -But instead, he's laying dead.
While the cop who shot him went home to his family.
[man] Yep.
-[whispers] That's good. -Mm-mm.
-[woman 1] Take your time, Shawna. -[woman 2] Take your time.
[Ben] There are only so many things we can do as private lawyers.
We don't have the power to arrest anyone.
We don't have the power to charge anybody for a crime.
The only thing I can do
is make a jury give financial compensation
as a measure of accountability, as a measure of justice.
[Ben] The thing I remember most profoundly
about meeting my personal hero, Thurgood Marshall,
was he did not tell us young, Black, aspiring lawyers
to go into courtrooms and argue what is legal.
He told us, "Go in courtrooms and always argue what is right."
[softly] Oh! I know what it is. I know exactly what it is.
[Ben] My law partner, Daryl Parks, and I, we turned down all our job offers
when we graduated from law school
because we wanted to do law
that could help our community, that could help Black people.
And we figured nobody was going to pay us to do the kind of law we wanted to do,
so we going to do it ourselves.
That is anything that will help pay the rent,
that's what we did.
The type of law that paid the most money
was personal injury and wrongful death cases.
And got real good at it.
But we started doing it so it could finance these civil rights cases
and started getting a reputation that…
Today, we have filed
a federal wrongful death civil rights lawsuit
on behalf of George Floyd's family and all of his children.
This is the tipping point.
This is the tipping point
for policing in America.
This is an unprecedented case,
and with this lawsuit, I do want to set a precedence
to make it financially prohibitive
that the police won't kill marginalized people and Black people
in the future in America.
[reporter] So there's no specific number that you're seeking?
We are seeking to make sure that justice is done by the family of George Floyd.
-Thank you, Mr. Crump. -Thank you. Thank you, Paul.
Let's do it. I think we got a lot of stuff accomplished, right?
-It was powerful, man. -No, that was good stuff.
I understand real clear that we do have the two justice systems in America,
one for Black America, one for White America.
But when you keep trying to make the case
in the media and the court of public opinion,
then you might just get a chance to get into the court of law.
It's no guarantee, by any stretch of the word. Ask Eric Garner's family.
It was on video, everything, but not even a-- a trial.
[Ben] I'm a Black man in America.
So you always got to take it easy with the press.
You try real hard to think before you speak.
And you can see the press as an enemy and a foe,
or you can try to strategically make them an ally.
I got ten minutes. Uh, you called at the right time.
Then I gotta bounce.
[Ben] We go into it knowing that if it's going to become a case,
it's going to become a case because we made it a case.
What Sybrina said, and y'all saw it on CNN,
"Trayvon Martin is not just my child."
-"He's everybody's child." -[crowd cheers]
"And if it can happen to my child, it could happen to your child."
[Ben] Before Trayvon, America really didn't care when Black people were killed.
We don't know if George Zimmerman was a racist or not,
but we do know he profiled Trayvon Martin for some reason.
[Ben] One of the things that I focused on
was making sure I reminded people that Trayvon Martin was a child.
Even though he was unarmed,
with a bag of Skittles and a can of Arizona Iced Tea.
Zimmerman had a 9mm gun.
We thought it was just outrageous that you had a neighborhood-watch volunteer with a gun,
and you had Trayvon Martin with Skittles, and the police didn't arrest the killer.
[Ben] Trayvon had not committed a crime.
He was walking home from the 7-Eleven,
and he was talking to his high school friend.
It became very personal to me.
It's something that I don't believe I will ever get over.
Trayvon Martin case prepared me for George Floyd.
[woman 1] The question is, why is it that none of your leaders are willing to be seen?
[woman 1] See, anybody… anybody can talk that mess in the back-room meeting.
But when you get out on this stage,
the things that Attorney Crump deals with is death threats.
You deal with challenging some of the most powerful people in this country.
That's why you don't see every civil rights attorney stepping out on the front line.
They all right with making the deals behind the scene.
But it's only a few that's willing to get out here and take it on, and sign their first name.
My name is Tezlyn Figuero. I cross the T and I dot the I in Figuero.
-I don't do no hiding on no social media. -[cheering]
Some of y'all like to use anonymous names. No, I use my full government name.
That means I'm willing to die for the cause.
So if you wanna know why Attorney Crump is always called upon by families,
it's because your local leaders don't answer the call.
Let's just call it for what it is. Ben ain't gonna say this, okay?
He's Martin. I'm Malcolm. I came to tell you what it really is.
They don't answer the call
'cause they don't want to piss off your police chief.
They don't answer the call 'cause they don't want to piss off your mayor.
They don't answer the call 'cause they don't want to piss off your DA.
The man that I'm bringing up has represented over 200 plus families,
names that you've never heard.
And some that you have,
such as George Floyd, Breonna Taylor,
Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin.
I really-- Mike Brown.
The list goes on and on.
I really believe in wanting to give this man flowers while he's alive,
because we wait too long for people to become ancestors
before we pay homage to them.
And I ask that you welcome
America's Black Attorney General,
Attorney Benjamin Crump. -[crowd cheering] -[banging drums]
[Ben] Symbols matter.
-Images matter. -[crowd applauds]
It is so powerful for history
that we project images that unite people
that are multicultural, multiracial, multi-geographical,
what is the direct opposite of that statue there…
…of that Confederate general.
It is that image that is an affront to the Declaration of Independence.
[Ben] Y'all, I knew it was going to be special tonight,
but when old Reverend Tez came and delivered a sermon…
[all] Good job, good job, good job, good job.
They are with us, and-- and that's how we gonna make some change in the world.
We got to get everybody saying,
"Our brother George's life matters."
"Breonna, everybody."
You know, but it's real, and people want what's real. Don't try to be anything you're not.
You always want to improve, but don't ever lose your authenticity.
-Don't ever lose that. -[man] Gotcha. Thank you.
[man] This kind of brings the family together.
It's a lot of media, and you kinda sharing your life with the public.
But some days, you just wanna grieve.
Last year of my life, it's been hell, honestly.
It just hurts seeing my uncle like that.
Growing up, I…
Watching him go through college, and do the things he did,
I admired that because I wanted to follow in his footsteps.
Even at the house, we had a basketball goal outside.
We would play almost every day.
You know, just being in the house with him every single day.
Um, we had a big family, and we didn't have a big house.
So you can imagine how close we were.
It was a lot of real love,
and… it's kind of hard looking at the video, knowing what kind of person he really was. And you just know he didn't deserve that. Nobody deserved that.
And you just know he didn't deserve that. Nobody deserved that.
A counterfeit $20 bill.
Give him a ticket or, you know, like…
How-- How does that lead to a man losing his life?
It-- It doesn't make sense. $20.
[news anchor] You've seen him at a microphone
after almost every race-related, high-profile tragedy.
You've heard his lies.
Ben Crump might be the single most destructive force in America.
The master of deception.
The one whose lies have come to be chanted in the street.
[man 1] Ben Crump is trying to inflame the crowd.
He plays the race card for profit, and I'm sick of it.
[man 2] Pimping out dead Black people on a day-to-day basis to make as much money as they can.
[news anchor] On the other side of this tally, while this destruction continues around the country,
Ben Crump, well, he's getting rich.
[Ben] Everybody won't agree with what we're doing, and that's fine.
I'm never going to say, "I got all the answers."
Y'all, what you got to do
is try to not just be a spectator on the sideline.
Get into the arena and do something.
[Ben] You know, I got a death threat last week.
There's a lot of people out there
who don't want to see Black people do well and get acclaim.
We need to stay in our place.
My staff, they get the comments on social media.
"If you came to my town, bringing that Black Lives Matter,
I… I'm going to shoot you dead" and so forth and all this stuff.
And so we turn it over to the FBI and keep going.
You kind of don't like the fact they know where you're at,
but, you know, everybody know where we at.
[Silky] Sometimes I'm fearful.
Um, just last week, I heard a strange noise inside the room.
And I was like, "Oh, Lord." And I rushed in the room, and he was on the damn phone. I was like, "Man!"
and he was on the damn phone. I was like, "Man!" "You just don't know how much that scared me." So I'm always fearful.
"You just don't know how much that scared me." So I'm always fearful.
-[on phone] Hi, Dad. -Hey, Brooklyn Zeta Crump.
I found my old phone.
Ah! The cute, little child phone.
The one you were supposed to have.
[chuckling] Oh, Lord. I should be so lucky.
[Genae] We are on our way to her dance class.
[Ben] Okay.
[Genae] Hey, Ben, you remember Harvey Brown? From my hometown.
Um, yes, ma'am.
[Genae] He has a particular case.
Anyway, he wanted to talk to you about it.
So I'm gonna send you his contact information.
So when you have time, can you reach out to him?
-[Brooklyn] Wait one sec. -Yes, ma'am. I will. -Okay. -Okay. You feeling better?
-Okay. -Okay. You feeling better?
I am. I am.
All right, sweetie. We, uh… We're doing a lot. We're juggling.
-Love you. -Love you too. -[jingle plays on phone] -[woman] We interrupt what you're--
[Ben chuckles] That's Silky's cell phone.
[Silky] Hey!
-All right, sweetie, I love you. Bye-bye. -Bye, honey. Love you.
[Ben] I was born in North Carolina to a… a single-mother household.
My grandmother was the matriarch of our family.
When my mother would go to work,
my grandmother would keep me
and all my brothers and cousins and everybody.
I think my grandmother, like our ancestors,
they had to lean on their Black imagination.
They had never saw prosperity for our people.
May it please the court. I'm Attorney Benjamin Crump. My client--
[Ben] Every time I go in the courtroom,
I try to think of the things my grandmother taught me.
"Whenever you speak, raise your head, look a person in the eye."
"Don't ever hold your head down."
We watched a lot of my family members
get caught up in the system, going to prison.
And she said,
"Promise me you won't do those things
because I want somebody in our family to be legitimate."
She said…
You talking about pressure. [chuckles]
And I was like, "Grandma, I'mma try my best."
"I'mma try my best."
My grandmother got to see me graduate from law school.
Mama, guess where I'm at now.
-[Helen] Where? -I am at 107 Spruce Street.
Are you around Turner Terrace, doing this?
I'm at Turner Terrace. -Showing them from whence I come. -[chuckles] Yes.
And I-- I-- I have so many memories of running up and down these stairs
-and playing football in the field. -Yeah.
It's good to come back to the old neighborhood.
[man] Do you remember me, Ben?
I-- I'm trying. What-- Who is it? -Mike. -[laughs]
-Mike… [says name indistinctly] -What's up, Mike?
-You doing all right? -[both laugh] -Good to see you, man. -You doing all right?
-I'm good, man. How you been doing? -I'm doing blessed. I'm blessed, man.
How your family, man? They doing good, man. Everybody doing good, man.
Hey, man. I'm glad to see you. Proud to see you. Yeah, you too, man. For real.
I've been seeing you on TV, I'm checking you out. [laughs]
-Keep praying for us. -I'm gonna do that always.
-Hey, love you, man. -Love you too, man. For real.
You remember we used to play football over there?
-Yeah? -Yeah. All right, fam. -Take care, fam. -You too, now.
[Ben] Everybody remembers it in our family.
Nobody really talks about it much,
how the police used to treat Black people living in the projects.
It was like a daily reminder that
you better stay in your place.
[officer 1] Watch it, man! Get down on your knees!
[officer 2] Don't look back. Don't look back. Put your hands behind your head!
[man sobs] Please, God, don't let her be dead.
[man 1 on recording] Did you ever hear anyone identify themself as police?
[man 2] No, nobody identified themself.
[Ben] What was the need to bust in her front door?
Police, you just can't bust in my house.
Especially me not knowing who you are,
in the wee hours of the morning.
Now, they don't do that to everybody house.
They only do that to some citizens' house.
[Ben] When you have a high-profile case and you know that there is a lot at stake,
oftentimes, as trial lawyers, we'll do mock trials.
There's still uncertainty that remains about whether they announced themselves.
[man] They could have turned on one camera
to verify this and put this to sleep. -And they didn't. -[woman] Mm-hmm.
I gotta change it. I don't like it. I like using the word "lie."
-But y'all don't-- -[man] Lying, covering up. What happened?
"Ignoring years of officers invading homes without announcing themselves,
in violation of the Fourth Amendment."
You never know what would be the issue that turns somebody.
A split verdict. We have the warrants are a yes…
[Ben] We use the information we get from the mock trials
to prepare our strategy,
our opening statements, our closing arguments.
This is…
the mutilation of Breonna's body
and the places she was hit.
One above her chest.
One is in her stomach area,
her arm, her leg,
back, shoulder, her buttocks.
Remember,
she was face-down in the end.
Just imagine what Breonna was going through,
laying on that ground in the hallway.
Thoughts rushing through her mind
about her mother, about her little sister,
her friends,
about her life,
about her dreams for the future.
Breonna was in that hallway alone.
Breonna's mother was on the scene at 1:10 a.m.
She was desperately trying to get answers as to what was going on,
and they sent her to the hospital,
even though the body cameras
showed Breonna lying in the hallway,
dead.
She was at the hospital for over two hours,
asking everybody who would listen,
"Can you tell me where Breonna Taylor is?"
"Can you tell me what room my daughter is?"
"Can you tell me anything about Breonna Taylor?"
"Do you have a name, Breonna Taylor?"
"Where is Breonna Taylor?"
For over two hours, this lady is begging.
Her name was Breonna Taylor,
and her life mattered.
Hello.
-[woman over video] Hi. -Hi, I don't--
Okay. So I'm trying to see. I'm outside on the side of the road.
[woman] Oh, gosh.
-Okay. I can't really see, so-- -It's a little bit-- It's a little--
-Okay. I can't really see, so-- -It's a little bit-- It's a little-- Can you straighten it at all or is it just the way it is?
Uh, I need to-- Well, I can try to straighten it,
but I'm literally setting up on top of a Rent-A-Car hood.
[woman] Mm, the car might be better just 'cause it's so bright.
-Okay, car might be better? Okay. -It might be.
Don't kill me. I am gonna make you go back outside. Make me go back outside?
-Because you're in a shadow here. -Okay.
-Then we'll just work with what we've got. -Okay, we'll make it work.
You wanna just put it back on top of the car hood?
[laughs] If you want me to.
Again, I can't see anything that you're wiping off. It's really fine.
-I can't tell if you're sweating. -All right. I'm sweating profusely.
You'll be talking about the Breonna Taylor case today?
Yes. Breonna Taylor's family believes,
after listening to these audio files released today,
that this was a conspiracy from the very beginning
to cover up the death of their daughter.
[Ben] I-- I talked to the family, told them, "Don't say anything."
We gonna put out a response from our legal team.
[Ben] People see these high-profile cases and that's what everybody sees,
but, uh, we're about to sue a couple of banks.
We're about to sue a private hospital
that we think are overcharging Black people.
Police shootings, that's probably 5 or 10% of what we do.
I came to cash my check
because I didn't have nowhere else to cash it.
because I didn't have nowhere else to cash it. I've never been to this bank before.
And the lady took my check that works at the bank.
[on video] Took my check and my ID and said she wasn't giving it back.
I had to call 911.
And I'm just standing out here, and I'm being discriminated against.
Hello, I came to-- How you doing?
I came to cash my check,
and she took my check.
She's right here.
[Sheira] She was standing at the glass just watching me.
And I remember looking at her face, and she didn't have any care.
When the police came back out, I was actually really scared
because I thought that she said something
that would make them think that I was committing fraud.
[Ben] When they figured out it was your check and they called your boss--
They called my boss to verify that it was my check. -They-- -Did they--
Did they say anything to you at that point?
-Yeah, they did. -What did they say?
"You know what this is, right?" Meaning?
That I was being discriminated against.
-So they got it, then. -He said, "You need to get a lawyer."
He even-- He told me, "If you need to film, you film."
-[baby crying] -I have to get milk for my baby.
The police is gonna give me money to get milk for my baby.
[Sheira] I really depended on my check that week to get everything I needed.
My check was for $90.
-Only $90? -Mm-hmm.
-It was $90. I think it was like $90.94. -So are we--
-We ain't talking about a huge check. -No.
Okay.
I was getting emotional. My babies were crying.
I just remember feeling so--
I was so embarrassed.
He told me, he said, you know, "I'll take you to get milk for your baby."
-[Ben] The police? -[Sheira] The police.
Thank you to these gentlemen. I appreciate you guys.
They had to bring me to get milk for my baby.
And I'm out of work due to the coronavirus, and I have no income at all.
[Sheira] I remember my mom, you know, going through that, trying to get food for us, and…
-[Ben] I watched my mother too. -[Sheira sighs]
I mean, that lady sacrificed for us, working two jobs,
killing herself trying to just make ends meet.
Banking while Black is real.
This bank will be held accountable. You and your babies gonna be okay.
[Ben] I always think I'm in a race against time.
There are so many things that happen in the world,
that if you don't seize the moment
when a movement is happening,
you can lose that movement.
It's fleeting.
You got to keep chipping away at it, chipping away at it.
That is great news, brother.
♪ Never say… ♪ [Ben] Optimism.
Self-determination.
Trying to define self-worth.
My fraternity, Omega Psi Phi, was giving me a foundation
for who I was to become.
You had young, Black people who were believing
that we had just as much right at this American dream as anybody else.
We believed that we were going to go out and we were going to change the world.
I was raised partly by my grandfather. He taught us how to farm.
He taught me how to farm.
He taught me if you take care of the land,
the land will always take care of you.
Black farmers used to own 15 million acres of land
in the United States.
And today, Black farmers are down to less than about three million acres.
Now, at the turn of the century,
Black farmers were one million families strong.
And today we are roughly, by the census, uh, about 45,000.
There's a lot of rich history.
Even today, most of White America
don't know that there's such a thing as Black farmers.
That's a low blow for somebody like me.
Hey, Mama. I'm with John Boyd who's the president of the Black Farmers,
and his wife is Kara.
-She's from Lumberton. -[Helen] Okay!
So, Mama, we are here on John's farm.
[John] We riding, Mama. And John is explaining to me about the farm
because we fighting for the Black farmers
so they don't get ran out of existence by these corporations.
[Helen] I know that's right.
They'd rather run us off our farms and…
and get, um, food from China-- -That's right, Mama. Mama got it! -…and Mexico, and everywhere else.
And I'm a country girl and I love country food.
And here in Tallahassee, I can't get none of my speckled buttered beans and peas.
-[Kara] We gonna send her some. -I'll send her some. [Ben] Hey, John grow it on his farm, Mama.
-I'll send you some. -[Ben] He said he'll send you some.
-[Helen] Oh, thank you, Jesus! -[chuckles]
-You know how to make collards! -[Kara] For you.
Did you-- Did you put ham in 'em?
-What you put in 'em? -[Kara] Yeah.
[John] Man, this is good. -[Ben] Oh, yeah. -[John] Man, you got to come more often.
-[Ben] Oh, yeah. -[John] Man, you got to come more often.
-[Ben] Oh, you don't get this regular? -[John laughs] Man, no.
Is there any way we can push Monsanto Bayer
for-- for testing for Black farmers?
Well, we should do it and have that be part of the settlement.
Yes. That's what we're asking for.
[Kara] John's father, um, did all the spraying.
And it isn't like present day where you have, uh, cab tractors.
We're talking about open tractors.
So you're spraying, so you're gonna get the drift.
They're pouring the chemicals, they're mixing it. There's no mask or anything like that.
They were never provided any type of information saying, "These are the precautions you should be taking."
Now he has this unexplained weight loss. I mean, you know, they suspect cancer.
And he's been spraying the chemicals all his life.
Has it been largely Monsanto's?
[John] Oh, yeah. Glyphosate, which is Roundup.
-[Ben] And they never trained anybody? -[John] They never trained anybody.
I'm pretty certain the big… bigger corporate farmers, they gave training to.
bigger corporate farmers, they gave training to. [John] Oh, they gave training to.
I know for a fact that they gave training to those, uh, farmers.
Uh, they… They never done a test run, that I know of, with a Black farmer.
[Ben] Allow me to give you my business cards.
I work with a… a whole team of lawyers,
and we're involved in litigation against Monsanto and Bayer
over the Roundup chemical.
Were you trained and taught how to use the products from Monsanto?
[man 1] No. My training comes from opening the box up,
screwing the top off, pouring it in,
and just being careful not to get it on you.
[Ben] Did they have any instructions they sent you or anything on the computer that trained you
or anything on the computer that trained you on how to deal with these deadly chemicals?
Just like him, just open the box and, you know,
Just like him, just open the box and, you know, just pour it in whatever you had to pour it in, and spray.
[Ben] Do you know if you've been tested medically
for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
[both] No.
-Neither one of you? -[man 1] No.
I just think they're completely out of tune with what's going on.
Maybe they're not living in the same reality we're living in.
I've been Black all my life,
and I just think the Black community is going to react in a way
that, if the city hasn't resolved this
and this verdict comes back as, historically, verdicts have come
when police kill Black people,
it is going to be bad for everybody.
[Ben] We were in intense negotiations with the City of Minneapolis
almost immediately after George Floyd was tragically tortured to death.
We said that, "No, you would not pay
the standard one million to three million dollars,"
which was the going price of a Black person's life.
We were going to make them give a historic settlement for George Floyd
or we were not going to settle this matter.
[man on phone] He had some nerve that we don't have a right.
In other words, "Mind your own business and stay out of Kentucky."
-Please be careful. -I-- You be very, very careful.
[Ben] Yes, sir.
-I appreciate it, Daryl. -You're welcome, man.
[reporter on TV] Protests in the nation's capital.
Challenger status Amy McGrath

The Kentucky Democratic Senate candidate
joining me as the campaign enters its final stretch.
That's next. Stay with us right here.
-Man. -[Ben] Is that Louisiana or…
-Yeah, we've been voting. -Louisiana gonna be blue or red?
-Every time I look at it, I see red. -[both chuckling] I ain't never saw it blue.
They gotta be better with the blue voting.
When I see that… When I see that junk pull up on the screen, I say, "Man!"
When I see that… When I see that junk pull up on the screen, I say, "Man!" "This is like the Crips and the Bloods over here."
You know, Florida got-- We had a crazy rule forever.
If you've been incarcerated,
you can never vote.
Oh, no. Just convicted felons?
If you were a convicted felon, you couldn't vote.
[Silky] Wow.
[Silky] With my arrest record and all the things that I've been through in life,
I couldn't even get a job at a sanitation plant.
Once Ben hired me, that was like a savior figure in my life.
It lifted me up when somebody believed in me.
[Ben] Silky's family.
Silky is a brother.
We affectionately call him Silky Slim
because that's what his street name was
when he was in a street gang, the Crips, and he was a triple OG.
[laughs] No.
All right.
Got that there.
Ten and a half, let's see if this works.
Slide on, comfortable.
Let me get this.
What a bargain.
[man on phone] I want to kind of orient people as to where this plant is.
It is on the side of town near the jail, near the casino,
in a predominantly African-American neighborhood.
Certainly a neighborhood that is mostly people of color.
Lead dust is all over the clothes and jacket and everything else,
and they go home, take that off,
and the lead is now in the homes.
Sixteen children since the 2000s
have been diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels.
Just so y'all know, Gopher makes 40 million dollars a year.
That's what we saw in Flint,
and that's why we had that historic settlement
of 614 million dollars,
uh, the largest amount settled for, uh, children in America.
Mr. Brown, you told 'em you were concerned about the lead.
[man] Yeah, that was the number-one concern.
How long have you been at Gopher?
[man] I've been at Gopher since 2011.
At the time, it was… it was hard for me to find good work.
[Ben] Yes, sir.
[Koungnum] When I got there, it was 30 of us.
-[Ben] Okay. -All of us were Black.
All of us was either… either on probation, felony, whatever the case.
We were-- Basically, we were disenfranchised.
-[woman] And the pay was good, right? -Oh, the-- No. Pay was 11.63 an hour.
-Okay. -In 2011.
-So it was more than minimum wage but… -[Ben] Yeah.
My son's only seven right now.
I'm gonna have to take care of him the rest of his life
because of all of the diagnoses that he has.
He can't even be in regular school right now.
[Ben] Yeah.
I received a phone call from a worker that worked at the department of health.
She called and wanted to know
if I was aware that my child had lead in his system.
And I told her, you know, I had already discussed that with the pediatrician,
the pediatrician explained, and we were taking every precaution.
Um, she said, "Well, he's the 17th child, um, that we've found."
I'm like, "What do you mean?" She said, "Well, you know, tell me about where is his dad?"
I'm like, "I don't know." She's like, "Where does he work?"
I said, "He works for Gopher Resources." And she… First thing she said, "Oh, my God."
I'm like, "What do you mean?"
She said, "Every single child on this list is a child from an employee,
a male that works at Gopher."

Thank you. Praise God.
I grew up in a church so much like this one
that when I came in, I said, "My Lord, if my mama was here with me,
she would say, 'Hallelujah!'"
[Ben] It's not just fighting racism and discrimination
in these police-shooting cases.
It's fighting racism and discrimination
wherever it rears its ugly head.
[congregation] Yeah. And far too often, environmental racism affects our communities.
And so that's why we're here in Tampa, Florida,
because at the Gopher battery plant in East Tampa…
…they were putting profit over safety,
and it reminded you of that movie, Erin Brockovich,
where you saw your children's lives being destroyed.
So let's stand up for those children in East Tampa because their lives matter.
[Ben] We're telling everybody
who might know somebody that lives in East Tampa
to call Sean Shaw up.
And put your name down too, if you would. Name and number.
-That's you and your father? -It's my father.
Okay. If you could put your name right there, and your number.
We-- We will definitely… Sean and I will be contacting you.
-Sean, you got one of your cards? -I do. Have a card, brother. There you go.
-Please call us. How old is your father? -Um, he's about 62.
-How long has he worked there? -Um, he's been about five years.
-How long has he worked there? -Um, he's been about five years. -Okay. -Five, six years, I believe.
-We definitely want to talk to him. -All right.
[Ben] Yes, sir. God bless you, brother.
[man] All right, y'all, it's raining out here.
You're gonna have to go down there in the water. God bless you.
-God bless you. -Continue to do the work you do.
-Keep us in prayer. -I will.
[news anchor] Tonight with breaking news, in a state of emergency
[news anchor] Tonight with breaking news, in a state of emergency in Louisville, Kentucky, after a grand jury decided
in Louisville, Kentucky, after a grand jury decided not to indict three police officers in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor.
not to indict three police officers in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor.
Hey, Mama.
[Helen] Heartbreaking, heartbreaking.
No justice to Breonna.
I say they gonna burn up Kentucky.
-It's not worth it. -We gotta pray they don't do that. Yeah, we gotta pray they don't do that, Mama.
[sobbing] Tell 'em… Tell 'em I… My heart hurts.
-I will, Mama. -I love you, baby.
-I love you too, Mama. Bye-bye. -Bye-bye.
[Ben] After months of intense negotiations,
our legal team settled the Breonna Taylor case
for a record 12-million-dollar settlement.
And it is tragic that there are no criminal charges brought,
but we don't get to control that.
I'm talking to Gayle?
How is the family processing their grief? They're awarded 12 million dollars.
So, on some level, somebody thought that some wrongs--
that they had been wronged in this particular case.
To have no charges, nobody held accountable
for the death of their daughter.
You know, Gayle King, that-- that is the hard thing.
The civil settlement was very significant on many fronts.
It set a precedence for a systematic reform
and speaking to the value of Black women's lives, uh, in society.
However, as Tamika Palmer said,
she wanted accountability, so it would serve as a deterrent.
You show up in a city, and I can almost hear, "Oh, blank."
"Ben Crump just showed up."
Well, I'm an unapologetic defender
of Black life, Black liberty, and Black humanity.
And that's why I am proud to call myself a civil rights lawyer
who believes that it's about these romantic notions
of liberty and justice for all.
That might be more impressive, what you just said,
if you were doing it pro bono.
If you weren't making a lot of money on this.
Well, I will tell you, Ted,
the police brutality division of my law firm
is the least profitable of all the divisions in my law firm.
For every Breonna Taylor,
there is a hundred Black people and brown people
who have been killed by the police unjustifiably,
that you don't make a penny on,
but you take the case because it's the right thing to do.
[Tezlyn] Why do you think it bothers them--
I'm talking about Black folks, let's not talk about the white folks.
I'm talking about just people that tear us down in our own communities,
that say it's all about the money.
Why do you think people have such resentment
for somebody who's lost a life?
That now they have to take care of their children.
They've left family behind that was dependent upon them.
Why is it so hard for people to understand
that the only way to get justice through the civil side
is through punitive damages?
You would think that that would be celebrated universally.
What do they want to--
They'll say, "Okay, no, no."
"Black people, don't take money for your loss,
but it's okay if you get crumbs."
"We think that's way too much money."
And oh, by the way, something you have no control of,
like the criminal matter,
that if you go back to high school civics,
you know is completely controlled by an elected government official.
They're saying, "Oh, no." "Put your trust and faith in them
and don't take this monetary settlement
that can change the financial, uh, affluence
for your family for generations."
Had you not brought attention over these last 10, 12 years…
We now have seen incremental change.
Since the George Floyd murder,
over 100 cities have now changed police reform on one level or another.
[woman on video call] What does justice look like for your family?
At the end of the day, justice is a conviction.
At the end of the day, justice is a conviction. Uh, so many times I have seen African-American people killed,
Uh, so many times I have seen African-American people killed,
and nobody gets a conviction.
[Ben] With George Floyd, I'm doubling the efforts.
We have to get a verdict of guilty.
We cannot let our foot off the gas.
I was not going to let us have a repeat
of what happened in the Trayvon Martin killing.
[reporter] Do you think the outcome would have been different if the races were reversed?
would have been different if the races were reversed?
You know-- If George Zimmerman was Black and Trayvon Martin was white.
Well, we know that a 17-year-old, unarmed boy was killed,
and I think all America has to dig deep in their heart
to try to find out how we, as a society, can learn from this tragedy
and how we can make sure that it's not repeated.
[Ben] We were tormented after Trayvon Martin's killer
walked away scot-free with no accountability.
I've seen hundreds and hundreds of these cases.
Normally, when the police kill young, Black boys
Normally, when the police kill young, Black boys and young, Hispanic boys…
nothing happens to them.
But because we got this video tape,
I-- I want to believe that we're gonna have a different result.
This is our best chance at holding police accountable for killing a minority,
and… unfortunately…
it's like, uh…
You hear a lot of…
more senior African-Americans say,
you know,
"We… We don't expect…
equal justice."
"It's not our reality."
I guess only time will tell. Uh…
History…
is history.
-Ay, ay, ay, Brook! -Yes! Good job!
-[laughs] -Go ahead, girl.
Go, yeah!
Blow 'em all out.
[Ben] I, unfortunately, have to stay on the road a lot.
That means I'm away from my family.
[Genae] Happy birthday, baby girl. Happy birthday.
[Ben] Seems like every time I come home,
my daughter has grown another couple of inches.
"A judge and a lawyer."
-Okay. All right. -"Benjamin Crump."
[Ben] My wife and my daughter, my mother, my whole family,
they all have to sacrifice a lot.
And I'm-- I'm eternally grateful for them.
Silky Slim.
Talk to me fast, man. I just landed.
[Ben] The family, you know, this is devastating to them right now.
We want to keep the pressure on because people will forget about it.
They'll kill somebody else tomorrow.
[woman] I drove away because I was scared to get out of the car.
-[woman] Who's that? -[guns firing]
[woman] Why did you shoot us?
[man] Who shot you?
The officer was shooting at us.
[Tafara] I kept screaming, "I don't have a gun."
I told them, "Please don't shoot, I have a baby."
"We have a baby."
They laid Marcellis on the ground and covered him up with a blanket.
I know he was still alive.
[sobbing] And they took that away from me instead of letting--
[breath catches] Oh, man.
-Thank you, Ben. We believe in you. -Yes, sir.
My whole team, anytime, we're all accessible to you.
-Okay. Bless you, sir. -All right. God bless.
[Ben] How are they saying Tafara is doing?
She saying, "Mama, I go to sleep and I dream about it."
She's like, "Mama, they killed him." She's like, "I'm scared."
She really gonna need some therapy, yeah.
For Marcellis.
She got survivor's remorse.
Like, she feels bad being the one that survived.
Like, she feels bad being the one that survived. -So she definitely need that therapy. -[Ben] Yeah.
Yeah, you know, this is all new to me.
This-- This is very much like a dream to me.
And sometimes I wish I could just go back to sleep.
-[Ben] Yes, ma'am. -Like… [sighs]
[Silky] What happens is when you have a case like this,
the police send in their full team of investigators
to investigate the homicide.
They knock on the doors first.
In most cases, they're looking for that footage
so that they could create the narrative that they want to create.
So we have to try to play catch-up as quick as we can.
Attorney Romanucci and our legal team
will be looking at every aspect of what happened
from beginning to end, Latoya.
Now you will hear from
Tafara's sister,
uh, Sasha.
And this is very emotional. Um, from Sasha Williams.

[Ben] What I think about often is…
getting to know these individuals only in death.
What would it have been like had I met 'em in life?
I have the reoccurring nightmare that I'm running out of time.
It becomes agonizing.
What can I do to stop the next mother or father
from being heartbroken?
This should not be a funeral program.
This should be a graduation program.
Nineteen-year-old Frederick Cox Jr.'s name
Nineteen-year-old Frederick Cox Jr.'s name joins that row of our teenage Black boys
who have been killed and nobody has been held accountable.
I do not understand, America.
While you can have thousands of people storm the nation's capital…
-[people cheer] -…and you can use restraint
and you can deescalate
and you can use your training,
but when it's a young person of color,
when it's a young, Black man,
you shoot first and ask questions later.
So the question is,
why do police in America
keep shooting Black people unnecessarily?
-Frederick Cox… -[people] Yeah.
[Ben] …shot in the back.
[woman sobs] Oh, God. I can't go in there.
-[man] He grabs the door. -[woman] I can't, I can't.
[man] He pushes Tavaris and Vivian in through this door.
[woman sobbing] My baby. My only baby.
He took my only baby.
He took my only baby.

I gotta really concentrate on getting some rest.
I think my body is telling me.
I found-- found myself coughing.
I can't get a cold right now,
but I have been getting very little sleep.
[man] I did what you asked. I tried to get him to eat breakfast.
I did. He asked for it.
My wife, my little girl, my mama,
everybody who I love is telling me,
"Slow down."
I can't slow down
because you just feel like you running out of time.
[Ben] My law partners would rather I not do civil rights cases.
They think I've done enough.
They always tell me,
"Ben, we make money a lot easier
and more of it doing all these other cases."
"Why do you continue to want to do these civil rights cases?"
They're greatly concerned about my safety.
They're greatly concerned about my mental health.
They're greatly concerned about my family,
with me having to be gone so much from them.
Tell me again, Genae, how we went for getting this dog.
Okay, so Miss Brooklyn has been asking for a dog
for the last, I would say, what? Year and a half?
-[Brooklyn] Two. -A year and a half to two years.
So, two weeks ago, she comes to me, crying, in tears.
She was like, "Mommy, I really want a dog."
She says, "And even at school," you know, "everybody has a pet."
"And they tell stories about their pets."
And she says, "And I-- I tell stories about Skyler." Now let me tell you what Skyler is. Skyler is a stuffed dog
Now let me tell you what Skyler is. Skyler is a stuffed dog
that I had gotten years ago from Victoria's Secret,
that always sat on my banister.
And over the past few weeks, she's been--
You know, she even got a leash for it,
and pretending that the dog was real and all this kind of stuff.
So that is the whole reason on why I was like,
"I have to get my baby a dog,"
especially with the fact that she's over here making up stories
-about a fake dog. So-- -[Brooklyn scoffs]
Brooklyn, you been getting up every morning, taking him out to use the bathroom,
or have other people been helping you?
-No. -[Genae whispers] We are a team.
No. Me and Mommy are a team. [chuckles]
Genae, you're like a bad director right now.
[Brooklyn] He has become a wonderful dog to our family.
[Genae] He is part of our family.
And, Ben, you're going to take a liking to him.
[Ben] All right. Brooklyn Crump,
you are the person who is responsible solely for that dog, for life.
[Brooklyn] Okay.
All right, don't you forget.
[Brooklyn] Okay.
[Ben] Okay.
I love y'all. Bye. Mwah.
-[Genae] You too. -[Brooklyn kisses]
[Brooklyn] Bye!
[Ben] I think, like most human beings,
the George Floyd torture video is stained on my brain.
You see him begging
for breath,
but yet they don't do anything about it.
When you're laying in your bed at night,
and you're trying to think about legal strategies,
it comes to you.
"What can I do to make sure we get justice?"
-Apparently, they don't have the votes. -[man on phone] They don't, huh?
-Not for-- -It's… Yeah. Not for the-- what we are deman-- demanding.
-That's where we're at, I guess. -Okay.
They think they're going down the wrong path
and they don't wanna keep going down it,
but I'm like, "This is not the case to draw a line in the sand on."
[man] Nope. Not this one.
They're-- They're gonna pay a price.
They're gonna pay a greater price in security and human cost.
-All right, partner. Love you, man. -[man] Thanks, buddy. Bye-bye.
If they don't offer the right number,
you got to let them know we are not backing down.
This case has to set a precedence.
Anything less would not be honoring the legacy of George Floyd.
Let's put on our armor,
because if ever there was a time to go to war,
it is over George Floyd.
Ben, uh, just a few moments ago, the city announced
Ben, uh, just a few moments ago, the city announced that it was going to closed session
to discuss the civil lawsuit that you brought against the city.
We have one source with the city telling us
that they're potentially discussing a potential settlement.
What would that mean to the Floyd family?
I think that, just like with Breonna Taylor's case,
the city leadership must act responsibly.
It's not enough just to say they care.
They have to show they care.
And they can't control what's gonna happen in the criminal courts,
but what they can do is exhibit responsible leadership
in the face of this horrific tragedy
that really was a watershed moment for America.
Do you believe that we could see a potential settlement today?
All things are possible.
All right.
So here we are, y'all.
Uh, the city council literally is in executive session.
They're gonna come back out, they're gonna have a public vote.
-Oh, did-- -[Antonio] Here we go, folks.
[city clerk] This is Casey. I believe we have, um, the return
from all council members into this public forum.
[council president] Go ahead and read for the record
that Councillor Goodman moves to approve the settlement of all claims asserted
in Kaarin Nelson Schaffer, plaintiff,
as trustee for the next of kin of George P. Floyd Jr.,
civil number 201577,
by payment of 27 million dollars
to the estate of the next of kin for George P. Floyd Jr.
The motion has been moved. I will second the motion.
Clerk will call the roll.
-[Casey] Council member Fletcher. -[man 1] Aye.
-[Casey] Council member Schroeder. -[man 2] Aye.
[Casey] Council member Osman.
-[Casey] Council member Cunningham. -[man 3] Aye.
-[Casey] Council member Ellison. -[man 4] Aye.
-[Casey] Council member Goodman. -[woman 1] Aye.
-[Casey] Council member Johnson. -[man 5] Aye.
-[Casey] Council member Palmisano. -[woman 2] Aye.
-[Casey] Council member Gordon. -[man 6] Aye.
-[Casey] Council member Cano. -[woman 3] Aye.
-[Casey] Council member Reich. -[man 7] Aye.
-[Casey] Council member Osman. -[man 8] Aye.
[Casey] Council Vice President Jenkins.
[woman 4] Aye.
[Casey] President Bender.
[woman 5] Aye.
[Casey] There are 13 ayes.
[Bender] That carries and that is approved.
So I just want to be clear
that the Minneapolis City Council has now unanimously approved
the 27-million-dollar settlement of the civil lawsuit
filed by Minneapolis. -[Ben] Wow. -Right?
[Bender] I hope that today will center the voices of the family
and anything that they'd like to share.
No amount of money can ever address
the intense pain or trauma caused by this death
to George Floyd's family.
Your reaction here?
You just heard the news, 27-million-dollar civil settlement.
What does this mean for the Floyd family?
It means that the City of Minneapolis
did not just say that George Floyd's life matters.
They showed that his life mattered.
It's historic,
the highest amount ever paid
in a police, civil rights, wrongful death in United States' history.
Hey, Mama, it passed.
The city approved the 27-million-dollar settlement for George Floyd.
[Helen] Yes, Lord! I…
I prayed that, um, they'd get justice for him too.
[Ben] History will judge us
on our commitment to our principles of humanity.
I mean…
It's gonna be a long journey.
A long journey to justice.
This is but one step…
on the journey to justice.
[man] God,
we look to you.
God of our comfort.
God of our tears.
God of our pain.
God of our outcry.
You chose George Perry Floyd…
to move the consciousness
of America
and the world
towards justice.
God,
we're standing on the shoulders of our ancestors
who are buried under the Atlantic Ocean right now,
believing you for a better day.
[Ben] Today…
starts a landmark trial
that will be a referendum
on how far America has come
in its quest
for equality and justice for all.
[news anchor 1] Protests on the streets of suburban Minneapolis yesterday
after a police officer shot and killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright
during a traffic stop.
[officer 1] I'll tase you! Taser, taser, taser! [officer 2] Oh!
[officer 1] Holy shit! I just shot him.
Uh, Mr. Crump's office. This is Adner.
[news anchor 2] This is also a tense night in the Twin Cities.
Tonight, a dusk-to-dawn curfew is in effect,
amid a second night of protests.
They trying to stop their city from being destroyed.
Absolutely.
[man] Testing. Can you hear us? Testing. Can you hear us?
[reporter] The police pushed them further back, but it--
You now represent the family of Daunte Wright.
That family has called for calm.
What is your reaction to what you are seeing now
playing out on the streets of Brooklyn Center?
[rioter] They're gonna take her out!
Well, Don, obviously, this is a very emotional time.
You have these police officers, within ten miles of the courthouse,
stop this young, Black man for driving while Black
with an air freshener.
He ends up being killed by this officer
who claims she meant to pull her taser,
and that's just unacceptable.
[Ben] It is just something I could not fathom,
that a police officer
would shoot and kill another unarmed Black man!
It's something that if you told me
and I didn't see little Daunte's face
and his mother, grandmother crying,
I wouldn't believe it.
Because if ever there was a time
when nobody in America should be killed by police,
it was during this pinnacle trial
of Derek Chauvin.
If y'all are ready, we're going out.
Present with us today
is Daunte's mother and father,
Katie and Aubrey Wright.
We were building my son up to be somebody.
He was gonna be somebody.
He was a good kid.
I'm very hurt. I don't really talk much.
It's taking a lot for me to talk right now…
in front of the crowds and stuff,
but my son was very much loved. We loved him a lot.
[man on phone] Ms. Katie and Mr. Aubrey,
let me just express my condolences
on behalf of the president and the vice president
and the entire White House,
uh, for your loss.
We're working on high alert right now because, um, of all of the things
We're working on high alert right now because, um, of all of the things that's going on at one time,
and by him being involved in all of those things,
that makes him the potential target for anybody that wants to do something crazy.
So, definitely, we've been covering down on him more than normal.
This is a unique Quran for me. I'd never get rid of it.
My house was shot up with an AK-47,
and the bullet struck this Quran and another book that I had on my bed.
So I keep this Quran. It's dear to me.
Definitely dear to me, yeah.
Everybody loves Ben in his mind,
but I tell Ben, "Look, we got to take this serious."
Because every day, it might not be a camera.
One day it might be a gun behind that camera.
And at the same time, me and Ben's decision to walk to the courthouse,
we made that decision to show that we're not walking in fear.
I-- I feel the case is going well,
but y'all know we've never convicted a police officer of second-degree murder
but y'all know we've never convicted a police officer of second-degree murder in the state of Minnesota ever before. It's never happened.
And so, uh, despite the fact that I feel good about it,
I'm still a little nervous. [chuckles] You know?
So now it's all done. It's the jury's job now.
And we are not going to start, um, counting our chickens before they're hatched.
But if the conviction comes in
like I believe and have prayed that it does,
we are not going to be satisfied with just a run-of-the-mill sentence,
'cause this was not a run-of-the-mill crime.
One of the best prosecutions of a police officer
for killing a Black person in America
has been you and your team, so we acknowledge you.
[Ben] The city attorney called me saying they're being notified that a verdict is in.
Send me my talking points. Confidentially, confidentially.
We got a verdict in.
All right.
All right, sweetheart. I love you. I think it's a good sign.
Okay. Bye.
[reporter on phone] As soon as the court is ready to read the verdict by this jury,
we're going to take you in there live.
You won't miss a moment of it.
[bailiff over video feed] All rise for the jury.
[judge] Members of the jury, I'll read the verdicts
as they'll appear in the permanent records of the Fourth Judicial District,
State of Minnesota, county of Hennepin District Court,
Fourth Judicial District.
State of Minnesota, plaintiff, versus Derek Michael Chauvin, defendant.
Verdict count one.
Court file number 27-CR-20-12646.
"We the jury in the above-entitled matter as to count one,
unintentional second-degree murder while committing a felony,
find the defendant guilty."
[judge] Same caption, verdict count two.
"We the jury in the above-entitled matter as to count two,
third-degree murder, perpetrating an imminently dangerous act,
find the defendant guilty."
[judge] Same caption, verdict count three.
"We the jury in the above-entitled matter as to count three,
second-degree manslaughter,
culpable negligence creating an unreasonable risk,
find the defendant guilty."
[Ben] America finally lived up to its promise
of equal justice under the law.
I'm standing here with Cedric.
We've been talking, we've been watching every second of this,
the vice president, all of us, and, uh,
I'm just… I'm… We're all so relieved.
-All right. -Thank you, Mr. President. God bless you.
We came for one thing and one thing only. That was justice for George Floyd.
-[man] Come on. -And today, that's what we've got. -[man] Yeah. -[crowd applauds]
[Ben] One thing I know,
and I have no ambiguity about it.
I know who I am
and I know whose I am.
It does not matter,
the amount of criticism heralded towards me.
It does not matter
if there's a misunderstanding of my objectives.
I have been given influence for a reason,
and shame on me if I don't use that influence.
[Ben] We are stronger than they ever perceived us to be.
You have an obligation now to go and use this education
to do things in the world that are not being done,
to say things in this world that are not being said,
and I know that you all are going to help us win this fight.
[Ben] We may have battles that break our hearts,
