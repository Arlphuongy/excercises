Hello, Villon! Where are you?
I'm on my way.
You already left. Where are you?
I said I'm on my way!
Just tell me where the spare key is so I can empty it.
No, the keys are with me.
How many times do I have to say that I don't have a spare?
Are the jerks on their way there?
Are you nuts? The rat squad is on its way!
So hurry up!
Okay, okay!
Make sure no one touches my things.
Make sure no one touches my things. Someone's calling.
Okay, okay. Hurry up!
Hello?
Brother, where are you now?
I'm almost there. I'm on my way.
I'm almost there.
Is that so?
Okay. Is Auntie coming?
No, she can't walk properly.
Okay, how about Mom's dress?
It's with me.
That's good. Mom might haunt us if she's not wearing that dress.
How's Yanni?
Yanni is at the chapel.
Uncle and his family already left.
They couldn't wait for you. They won't come back tomorrow.
Mom's siblings are so…
Okay, okay.
Okay, bye.
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
Hello.
-Hello, Papa. Where are you? -Baby?
I told you I'm on my way there.
I'm on the way.
Did you buy the toy you promised me?
I have it with me.
I'm on my way.
-Okay, Papa- -Okay, baby. I have to go. Bye.
Fuck!
Fuck, shit!
Fuck.
Please move ahead.
Please sir.
Good evening, sir.
Good evening.
Checkpoint, sir.
I'm Detective Edmund Villon.
Oh!
What happened?
Only a checkpoint.
Looks like you're busy.
Just doing some overtime, sir.
Okay, I'll go ahead. Thank you.
We're not done here.
Wait.
You've been drinking.
I can smell you.
What?
You smell like booze!
You should know what to do.
Just let it go.
That's a violation.
That's in RA1056, section 6.
You can be detained, sir.
What's fucking section 6 again?
Sir, it's simple.
There's a liquor ban, you're driving under the influence. Give me your license.
Bro…
Just give it.
The truth is there's been a death in the family.
I'm just going through a hard time.
Can you please just let it go?
I'm not driving far.
Condolences, sir.
-Thank you. -Give me your license.
I still need your license.
Bro, I'm sorry.
Actually, my mother died.
I'm just going through a tough time.
-It's the last night of the wake. -It's not allowed.
-Let it go. -Just give it.
-Just give me your license, sir. -I just drank a little.
It's not a big deal.
It's simple, just give me your license, sir.
Please bro, let me go this time.
Wait, sir. Just stay there.
Hey! I told you to stay, dumbass!
Watch him!
Yes sir.
Sir!
What?
This arrogant jerk won't cooperate.
-Sir! -What's the problem?
Good evening, sir.
I'm Detective Edmund Villon.
Sorry, I just drank a bit.
I'm just going through something.
Tomorrow is my mother's burial.
Please do me a favor and let this go.
Sir, he tried to escape.
-No! -He was about to back up.
Why would I run? I'm here asking nicely, sir.
I'm just having a tough time. Please help me out here. Okay?
I'm also a cop. We're all cops here.
-You're a cop? Where? -Show us your ID.
Or your badge. Where is it?
Give them to us.
I'm from the PNP Intel Division.
From which precinct?
We can call them up.
Give me the number.
And the local number too.
So? You're stalling.
4-4-4-
Wait, wait!
Slow down.
4-4-4
1-0-1-1
local 1308, got it?
-This is right? -Why would it be wrong?
Verify it.
-Go ahead, call. -Do you have prepaid minutes?
Of course!
-Sir-- -Verify it.
Can you give me a free pass?
I'm asking for a favor here.
-Okay, just wait a minute. -My destination is not far from here.
Sir! I know why he's in a hurry.
-He was probably involved in a crash. -Hey, don't touch my car!
-Take a look at this. -Don't touch that!
This bastard.
Look at this fucker.
Hey!
-Stop! -Hold him!
You're fighting back?
Get up!
Sir, they confirmed it.
What?
He's a PNP Intel officer.
What's his name?
Edmund Villon.
We're all cops here. Show some respect.
Why is this locked?
Do you have the keys?
Locked?
Whose desk is this?
It's Villon's.
Where is he?
At his mother's wake.
Get me something to open this, right now!
Sir, I have a hammer. Wait, I'll get it.
What's inside?
He just said not to open it.
What?
You know how he is.
He's different when he's mad.
Son of a bitch.
Here it is, sir.
Open it.
Hey, Mr. Kickboxer.
Bitch.
Fuck.
You broke my tooth, you idiots! Take a look!
Look!
What if I knock out your tooth?
Sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
Just sorry?
This is my favorite.
What's up, bro?
Mr. Hit-and-Run?
You'll throw me in jail during my mom's wake?
What's my name?
No, what's your name?
You bastard.
Sir, sorry. But next time you drink, please don't drive.
You should've verified his info faster.
-As if you stood up to him earlier. -Shut up.
You know I was just doing my job.
Hey! You bastards!
Motherfuckers!
Especially you!
This is a lot of money!
So many bunches.
You guys are too much.
You can't escape from this.
What's all this ruckus?
Chief.
Why are you here this late at night?
Detective Villon's mother has not been buried.
And now you're accusing him when he's not here to defend himself.
What the hell?
Are you even humans?
We're just following orders.
Leave now. Come back after the funeral.
Didn't you hear me? Get out!
Everyone who receives bribes are listed here.
Bribes from all kinds of businesses.
I said get out.
Elton Dizon - 50,000
Elmer de Asis - 200,000
Arturo Gopez - 200,000
Edmund Villon - 200,000
And more than half a million…
Chief, you're truly on a different level.
CALL ME NOW!
INTERNAL AFFAIRS RAIDED US!
VILLON, WHERE ARE YOU?
Fuck.
Shit!
Fuck!
Hello.
Where are you?
What? Wait! Can you give me a break here!
We already need Mother's clothes.
Okay, okay, okay.
-Bro! -I said yes already!
Shit! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck!
Brother.
Where's Erica?
She's waiting at the morgue.
Bring this to her so she can dress Mom.
Mama!
Mama!
Papa, what took you so long?
I had to go far to get your grandmother's dress.
Where's the toy you promised me?
Next time, baby.
When I have time.
You always say that, Papa.
Baby, please understand our situation now.
I'll make time.
I'll buy it. I promise, baby.
Okay?
This is a big problem.
Chief, can we please finish this after the funeral?
Hey Villon, you need to take responsibility for this.
Wait, wait.
Are you asking me to take the fall?
And you're asking me at my mom's wake? Wow!
Bro, please bear with us.
But we can't all go down just because of your list.
Take responsibility. I'll take care of you.
You? You're the one who wants me to take the fall!
All of you are on that list! Especially you!
All of your bar exploits are listed there!
-You listed those? -Miss Lumaylay, right?
-Three times a month, mostly yours- -Brother.
Not once, but thrice a month!
Mom is ready.
Villon, this is all just wrong timing. I'm sorry.
You have our condolences.
Sir, condolences.
Bro, condolences.
We'll go ahead.
Bro, sorry.
Internal Affairs ransacked our office.
I couldn't even find an envelope.
This is all I could give you.
Condolences.
Get this done already.
Fix her makeup.
It's good you were able to bring a proper dress.
-Yeah. -Yes, our brother brought it in time.
Are you going to leave the jewelry on her?
I'll let our brother decide.
Okay. Don't worry, we'll fix her up nicely.
IA MIGHT GO THERE. CLEAN UP YOUR CAR.
Who will stay for the night?
We'll talk about it later.
Chief, let's find dirt on the guys from Internal Affairs.
We need leverage against them.
If you can find some. They're not called IA for nothing!
They're still just cops. Don't put them on a pedestal, sir.
Don't overestimate them.
Wait, isn't that Villon?
Why does he have balloons?
What's this guy doing?
Okay, close the casket.
Sir.
Can I talk to you for a bit?
Of course.
I want to be with my mother for the last time.
-For you, sir. -Wait, you don't have to give me this.
A token of gratitude.
Okay,
if you insist.
Thank you.
You can stay only until midnight.
We need to move your mother to the chapel.
Okay.
-What are the balloons for? -For my daughter.
Mom, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God!
Why are you there? Go to your station.
I'm sorry, sir.
Mama! Mama!
Mama! Mama!
I'm really sorry, Mom.
It sounded scary!
-Come with me. -Really?
You've here for so long and you're still scared?
I heard something.
Mama!
Pick up, Central.
This is Central, copy.
Central, please check if someone's in Room B-20.
Negative. I can't see anything. You need to go inside.
Please bring the keys down.
Who will man my post?
You come and get them.
You're so lazy, man.
Okay, I'll come up.
Hey, don't leave me!
Son of a--
Wait, stay there. Catch!
What happened?
Sir, Ma'am heard noises in Room B-20.
Sir, I heard noises, like echoes.
What echoes? I know someone's inside.
What were you thinking?
No need for keys, it's not locked.
Someone's inside.
You may go.
Did you move it?
Oh, I rotated it earlier.
It's almost midnight. She needs to be moved, right?
-Yes, I'll call my men. -Okay. Someone might still visit.
I almost forgot.
All right.
We'll go home first, brother.
Please take care of her.
Bring me some clothes for the funeral tomorrow.
Okay.
What?
No, Father.
No.
-It's heavy. -So heavy, isn't it?
Be a good girl. Okay.
Thank you, Father, for the service.
-Condolences. -Thank you.
If you need me, I'm always here for your family.
He really loves your Mom.
Internal Affairs already backed out.
They confiscated all the money, so now we're even.
We did everything we could to clear your name.
See? We made it work somehow.
You just don't trust us.
Thank you, Chief. I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay. Take care.
Shit.
Boss, it looks like you're drunk.
Here.
Sir.
What the-- who told you to park there on the corner?
Sorry, sir.
Don't just say sorry! Fix this!
-You'll cause an accident! -I'll remove it.
So stupid.
What do we do? Chief will kill us!
We recently confiscated this homemade C-4 in a raid.
It's small.
But it's strong and has a wide blast range.
And most of all, it can be detonated from afar.
They're so desperate to look good
in front of the new National Police Chief.
Once this button is pressed,
the bomb will explode in two minutes.
Now, let's begin the demonstration.
We will blow up the symbols of the different types of corruption.
They will now install the cage, so we will be safe.
Don't worry, the cage is blast-proof.
And we only used a small amount of C-4.
Okay.
Ready.
Armed.
Hey, Villon's here.
How was the funeral?
It was okay, sir.
Man, it must be hard on you.
Of course. Plus, you wanted me to take the fall, so it became harder.
That's enough.
Don't be sarcastic, Villon.
Arturo was the one who found a way to fix everything.
See? You should be thanking me.
One round is on you.
Okay, all right.
Nice!
We need to be careful. IA might still be watching us.
Relax.
It's going to explode.
That's nothing.
That was intense.
We're dead meat.
Chief.
What's up, man?
Why is this not working?
Cold cases
and those near their statute of limitations. Fuck!
They were just assigned to us.
We're too old for this shit!
Why did they give these to us?
Probably, our punishment.
Elton, get some AR's from the armory.
Boys, let's move. We got a tip.
Here, let's go.
Abet Hogar a.k.a. "Apyong."
You're the target now.
Hey Villon, let's go!
Abet Hogar a.k.a. "Apyong."
Here, take a good look at him.
He's fronting as the owner of a high-end bar for the rich.
He's been reported before.
He killed some of his competitors.
His bar houses his drug operation.
So if we catch this lowlife, maybe
we can also get the entire organization.
We won't only redeem ourselves.
We might even get promoted.
Nice, a promotion.
This is your chance, Villon.
-Good afternoon, sir. -Good afternoon.
We have a search warrant
for Abet Hogar a.k.a. "Apyong."
Open the gate.
Let's go, sir.
Are there other people renting here?
No one rents here anymore, sir.
It was abandoned 10 years ago.
Sir Apyong is our only tenant, sir.
Why does the bad guy always hide in a warehouse?
-This way, sir. -Where?
Here, sir.
Sir, this is Mr. Apyong's office.
Do you have the keys?
No, sir.
Open it.
Wait. That's not allowed.
It's fine, I'll take responsibility.
There's nothing there.
I thought we'll hit the jackpot.
Sir, positive. This is Apyong's unit.
But it's negative on drugs.
So, what are we going to do now?
Search the place. We need to find evidence.
Okay, let's go.
-Where's the restroom? -That way, sir.
You come with me.
Bro!
What's up, bro?
Sir!
Someone reported a car accident here.
When?
The other day.
Are there casualties?
According to the report, the victim was loaded in the trunk.
Who tipped you off?
Anonymous, sir.
He hung up before we could trace the call.
Villon, did you find anything?
-Hey! -Sir!
It's you.
Chief, you remember Lt. Franco?
He helped us with Internal Affairs.
He's a subordinate.
-Is that so? -Sir.
This is Mark.
What brings you here?
Hit and run, sir.
The suspect drove off with the victim in his car.
Is that so?
It's not a hit-and-run, but a hit-and-take-home.
Do you have a lead?
Not yet, sir.
Actually, I still need to check the CCTV footage.
This way, sir.
There.
We also need to check it out.
We might also find a lead to Apyong.
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.
Okay, go with him.
Sir, I'll go, too.
No need, Arturo can go alone.
I'll go, since I don't have anything better to do.
All right.
Don't forget to feed Castro.
Then let's meet at the office.
-Yes, sir. -Okay.
Don't worry. Let's relax for now.
A lot of eyes are still on us.
Okay, just update me.
All right.
What did you do?
Did you find anything?
-Sir. -Yes.
Nice.
Anything new, bro?
The video has low resolution.
It's blurry and the accident happened at a blind spot.
It probably happened on this spot.
The video is too dark.
Right, it's too dark.
Do that later, let's eat first!
Let's eat!
Castro! Yummy, it's still hot.
Sir.
Hey, hold on.
Rewind it.
What?
Rewind it.
Play.
Go on.
Look, he's on the wrong lane, right?
See, he's on the wrong lane.
It means he avoided something.
Okay.
Then he swerved and got back on the right lane.
And then, bang! He hit something!
Where did you get the shards?
Show me.
Looks like it was hit here and landed there.
Right.
Forward it, look for the dog.
There, there.
Look at the dog.
So cute!
No, he seems to be watching.
It means something's happening there.
Go back to the car.
Check it out.
Stop.
Rewind it a bit.
It's a Vios, right?
It's a gray Vios, sir.
Gray or green?
-I think it's gray, sir. -Slate gray. Write it down.
Can you read the plate number?
I can't make out the letters.
But I can read the numbers.
Seven…
Six.
-Seven, six. -Seven, six. What's next?
Looks like eight?
Three?
What do you think?
I think it's three.
Three?
No, no. I think it's eight.
Three.
Eight.
That's a three.
That's an eight. Seven, six, eight.
Right? Okay.
Write it down.
I vote for eight.
What about the last number?
It's more blurred.
It's too dark, sir.
One?
Seven? One?
Looks more like one.
-It's fuzzy. -One or seven?
One?
Seven? One?
I think it's one, sir.
Too fuzzy, I give up.
Let's eat first.
Just one last number, sir.
Let's eat. Give up on that.
Because of the great amount of loss,
residents of the said barangay are seeking help,
even the parish priest of the said parish, Fr. Inocencio Santos
for financial assistance coming from the government.
Here, brother.
Your coffee.
It's hot.
Is the outing for Yanni's birthday still on?
Of course.
Okay.
Brother, I have a question.
Don't get mad.
It depends.
The shop tenant's contract is about to end.
Can I be the one to rent it?
I want to put up a pastry shop.
Let's wait for their contract to end first.
Maybe they want to renew their contract.
Just don't renew their contract.
You're a cop, right?
Hey, I'm a cop not a gangster.
What was that for?
Where will you get the capital?
From you, brother.
Please, brother. I don't want to be dependent on you forever.
Admit it, a pastry shop is a good idea.
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's wait if they'll renew the contract.
Okay.
I almost forgot.
Did Mom have a boyfriend?
What?
I went to a fortune teller.
She said, Mom has a man.
And she's with him until now.
It's really weird.
Everything she said was right.
My failed business, the flower shop.
And that you're separated from your wife.
She was only wrong about that.
Maybe Mom really has a man?
Mom had a lover?
Maybe?
So what?
PNP Intel, hello.
-Good afternoon. -Good afternoon.
I want to report a wanted man.
Okay, sir. Go ahead.
I have information about Apyong Hogar.
Who?
I just saw Apyong Hogar.
Sir, if this is a prank and you're just wasting our time,
don't call this line because
-I can sue you. -No, I'm telling the truth.
Understood?
Sir, I'm really--
PNP Intel.
Tell him to answer my call.
It's the one who just called.
What?
He wants to talk to you.
Okay, okay.
Sir, didn't I tell you to stop wasting my time?
I can easily file a case against you for this prank.
I just want to file a report.
I'm not doing anything wrong.
All right, what is it?
Like I said before, I saw Apyong Hogar.
Really now? Where did you see him?
That's what I wanted to ask you.
What did you say?
I said, that's what I wanted to ask you.
Bastard! Are you mocking me?
What I meant was, where did you take him?
What are you saying?
Is he in heaven or in hell?
Did you throw him in the ocean?
Or did you bury him?
You drive a gray Vios, right?
PNP Intel.
Please tell him to answer my call.
Villon, he said to answer his call.
-What? -On your cellphone.
Hello.
I know that you killed Apyong.
I think you're calling the wrong person.
I saw you run him over.
Can you sleep at night knowing you killed a man?
I don't understand.
-Who are you? -You already had your car fixed.
So what if I had my car fixed?
So what if I crashed and the insurance had it fixed?
Is that not allowed?
Can't say anything now?
Wow, you've also prepared your alibi!
Alibi? You're wasting my time, you fucker.
I'll end this call, so stop pestering me.
I'll just report that Apyong's body is at the cemetery.
I hope you buried him deep in the ground.
That didn't happen, bro.
What are you saying?
What the hell are you saying?
Okay, end the call. I'll really report you.
You're really the one who killed him, right?
Who are you, motherfucker?
What do you need from me, bastard?
Swear one more time and I'll go straight to the police.
You're not in the position to be arrogant, Villon.
I won't tell you what I want for now.
And don't ever look for me.
Because if I get mad, everyone will know what you did.
You look fine.
You don't look guilty at all.
I applaud your fighting spirit.
Crazy!
What the fuck? This guy's crazy!
This bastard, hey!
CAN YOU CATCH UP???
Where are you going?
Fuck!
Villon.
You're having a nightmare.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
And you're just here.
Get out.
The cemetery where your mom is buried is really big.
We explored it earlier.
Why were you there?
The signal of Apyong's cell phone was last traced near there.
It was turned off.
Cell phone?
Yes.
Your bumper is new, right? So smooth and shiny!
Had an accident?
-Yeah, I told you about it. -Right.
You weren't hurt?
-No. -Good.
You got a call.
See you at the office. Let's go.
How can a cop be so bad at a chase?
Did you think about it? Can we talk now?
I have a question.
How did you see me bury Apyong?
It was pitch dark.
It was dark, but it doesn't mean I couldn't see you.
Okay, go ahead.
Let's not get sidetracked here.
No.
You saw nothing.
You didn't see it.
You're just making it all up, motherfucker.
If you want to chase after me, if you want to investigate me,
go ahead. I don't care.
Because you don't really know where Apyong is! You son of a bitch!
You didn't see me bury Apyong, asshole!
Bastard! You don't have proof!
Villon, your phone is ringing. Answer it.
Are you hiding from someone?
No.
He called again?
You've been getting calls all day.
It's just a prank caller with nothing to do.
You motherfucking asshole! Asshole!
-Motherfucker! -Why are you hurting him?
Do you want me to expose you?
-What's the problem? -Boss, calm down.
Why are you attacking a member of our squad?
-Your squad? -Yes.
He's a cop?
Man, sorry, sorry.
I'm sorry. You just look like the man who conned me.
Sorry, sorry. I'm really sorry.
Bro, I'm sorry.
Chief, this is Lt. Franco.
He's the one who helped us with the IA investigation.
Thank you so much.
He's our savior! We owe him big time!
He's our hero.
Sir.
Thank you, sir.
-Elmer De Asis. -Sir.
-Elton Dizon. -Sir.
And the one you beat up, Det. Edmund Villon.
Really?
-He's Villon? -Yeah.
He's popular for being a sharp cop.
I'm sorry again. I mistook you for someone else.
Pretty Boy Villon, sorry.
Sorry, man.
Fuck man, sorry. I got it wrong.
Sorry, boss. I'm really sorry, Chief.
-Thank you, again. -Sorry.
Take care.
Are you okay?
He said sorry. Now, let's eat.
Let's go.
Franco.
There are two types of animals in this world, Villon.
One who hides his tail in front of an Alpha.
While the second type,
always retaliates no matter what.
Which one are you, Villon?
-So you're a cop. -So what?
Are you scared because I'm a cop?
What do you want?
That's the best question you've asked me all day, Villon.
Give me Apyong's body.
How can I do that?
I really don't know where he is.
Boss, boss, wait!
Wait, wait!
It hurts!
Boss, wait! Wait!
Bro, enough. It hurts. Bro.
Stop it, man.
Don't beat up a cop.
That was painful!
I wonder how much pain Apyong felt?
Stop it, man.
You're nothing.
Bring Apyong to me by tonight.
You fucker.
Sorry. I'm sorry, Mom.
Sorry, Mom.
Son of a bitch.
Shit!
What do you want to tell me, fucker?
Hello, Apyong.
Where are you, man?
I can't reach you.
I have a gig later.
You're hard to come by lately.
Hey, Apyong!
What's wrong?
Apyong!
Who's this?
Hello, bro. Please triangulate the cell phone number I sent you.
-What? -And send me a mug shot.
Right now?
Yes, right now.
Okay, sure, sure.
When you've traced the signal, I need you to send me the address.
What? That's not allowed. You need a warrant for that.
-What? -A warrant is needed.
There's no need for a fucking warrant.
Don't worry, bro. It's on me. I'll take the heat.
-Come on! -Okay, sure.
Okay.
Hey, bro.
Where's Villon?
Beats me.
Where has he been going?
A letter from traffic.
Overspeeding…
North Luzon Expressway
N-A-C,…
7-6-…
8-7…
Sir, inspection please.
And the entrance fee.
-How much? -500.
It's 500.
Thank you.
Come again, sir?
One beer, please.
Here, sir.
Thank you.
Hey, get some drinks. It's on me.
Thanks, bro.
-Hi, Babe! -Give me my shirt.
Kiss later, I'm drenched in sweat.
-We played well? -Yes.
-You almost made a mistake earlier. -Yeah, sorry.
Good thing you recovered.
-Be more careful on our next set. -Sure.
-Wait, I'm still getting dressed. -You're so sweaty.
Of course, I performed.
Cheers!
Hey, wait for me. Hey!
The next band is also good.
I missed you.
Yeah, louder!
Let's get crazy tonight!
You were great earlier.
-Let's make a toast. -Later.
Give me a minute, my bag… I'll come back.
-Where are you going? -I'll just get something.
Fuck!
-What do you need from me? -You ran away.
Hey, it hurts! Asshole!
Come with me.
What now?
Mommy!
What?
Go ahead!
-Having fun? -Boss, let me go!
Now, you call me "boss."
Put your foot out.
-Boss, this is too high! -Put your foot out!
-Please. -I'll shoot you.
Make me do something else.
Bitch! Your foot!
-I can't-- -Down.
Boss, this shit is high!
Son of a bitch, this is high!
Mommy!
Please let me go! I don't know anything!
-I'll really let you go! -Boss, don't!
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!
Are you ready to talk?
-Boss, please don't. Fuck! -What now?
I've just been waiting for you.
-I don't know! -Don't know?
Why is Franco looking for Apyong?
Boss, boss! Mommy, Mommy!
You really won't talk?
Then, I'll just drop you! What now? What?
-I'll talk! -What?
Apyong stole Franco's key!
What key?
-Please let me go now. -What key?
To the safe!
What's inside the safe?
Boss, I'm begging you…
-What's inside the safe? -Fuck!
Drugs!
Drugs!
The safe contains fucking drugs!
Franco is a big-time drug lord.
It started when he was assigned to head drug raids.
They confiscated a lot of drugs from dealers.
Police officials like him.
They thought he reported all confiscated drugs before disposing of them.
They thought he's straight. They trusted him.
They didn't know he is stealing drugs.
He found a way to process drugs dissolved in water.
He has his own drug lab with Apyong.
They were able to create a unique formula from those drugs.
Plus, it's even more potent.
They mix it in alcohol and they sell it exclusively in Franco's bars.
He deals with a lot of businessmen, drug lords and syndicates.
They all love Franco's concoction. The high is one of a kind.
It's expensive but they clamor for it.
That's why they got rich off of his formula.
Millions, maybe billions. You will never know.
Maybe that's why Apyong betrayed him, he got greedy.
He didn't know that Franco is truly a demon.
He'd look for him no matter the cost because he stole the key to his safe.
Franco killed a lot of men looking for Apyong.
He shows no mercy and kills everyone.
Of course, all his money is in that safe.
Franco will do anything to find Apyong.
Apyong will keep the key in his body.
I know him. Everything important is inside his body.
Fuck, man.
Son of a bitch! Shit!
Villon!
Stay there. Don't move.
-Bro, relax. -Don't move!
Relax. Please, please!
-Drop it! Drop it! -Okay, okay.
There.
Bro, relax. Please.
-What the hell are you doing? -I didn't do this, bro.
So what's that?
I didn't kill him. Please believe me.
Fuck, he was already dead!
-He was fucking shot! -Look!
Take a look.
Your car was already wrecked before you crashed into the patrol car.
Am I still wrong?
Okay, okay, okay…
I can explain, man. Lower your gun first.
Fuck, man. Wait, bro!
Fuck, man! God damn it!
What the fucking hell!
Fuck, man.
I know we're no model cops, but we're not killers.
How did you end up like this?
Just turn me in…
I'll confess everything.
I'll talk. I'm just so tired. I want to rest.
Rest?
How can you think of resting now?
Well, at this rate, you might be resting for most of your life.
You'll be facing manslaughter…
Disposal of body…
Didn't you think of your daughter?
You drive me crazy.
You're crazy.
Fuck it.
Do what you must. It's your life.
Here.
Do you think I'll sleep better if I lock you up?
Bro…
Your mom just…
Your mom just died and then this?
Bro…
-Bro… -No need to thank me. It's okay.
Bro, please help me.
I'm helping you right now.
Not this, bro.
A cop is blackmailing me.
-That's this nonsense? -It's true. He's a cop.
That guy, Apyong, I accidentally ran him over.
Lt. Franco, that fucker…
I really think he's the one who killed him.
Believe me, man.
I'm sure he's the killer.
Who's that?
Pretty boy,
are you with Arturo?
Get out of the car. This is important.
Are you watching us?
Get out if you don't want Arturo to get involved in this.
What's wrong?
Well, well.
Look who's ordering me around?
Listen, bro, where the hell are you?
Don't ask, just cross the road.
You want Apyong, right?
No, you come here. I'll wait for you.
No, this place is big. I'll wait right here.
Right now. I'll be waiting.
I have places to be.
-What? Come! -There. Just stay there.
Where are you?
Hello?
Hello?
-Okay, go! -Are you there? Hello!
So, how's the aim?
The operator is good, right?
Now, let's stop this nonsense.
Just get Apyong and bring him to me at 6 a.m.
You bastard. Why'd you have to drag him into this?
Fuck, I told you I'd give him to you, right-
Hey, hey, are you crying?
I'll rat you out, you motherfucker!
I didn't know you're so emotional.
Let's go to jail together, you motherfucker!
Villon, just focus on the work at hand.
Coming.
-Who are you? -I'm Lt. Franco, we spoke earlier.
But my brother is not here.
I'm talking to him right now.
Hello, Villon.
I'm here at your condo.
-Come in. -I'm coming in.
I'll come in and wait for you.
I'm inside. Thank you.
Hey!
I'm in your house.
-Don't touch my family, you bastard! -Hi, Jeff!
-Fucking Bitch! -I met Jeff.
You must be Villon's daughter.
-No, no, no, no! -What's your name?
Yanni, sir.
Oh, it's Yanni.
-Yanni, Yanni! -Your daughter draws well, man.
Don't fucking hurt her, you son of a bitch!
Brother?
What's wrong?
Where is he?
-Brother, what happened? -Who?
-Brother, wait. -What's happening?
Brother? Brother!
What's wrong?
-Where is he? -Who?
-Where the fuck is he? -Brother, what are you doing?
-Lower your gun, brother. -Where is he?
Brother, please calm down. What's wrong?
Where's Yanni? Yanni!
She's in the room.
-Brother. -Where is he?
What happened?
-Where did he go? -Who?
He already left.
-The guy who went here? -Yes, the lieutenant.
Your friend. I let him in because he said he'll wait for you.
Fuck! What did he say?
-He said he'll come back. -Why did you let him in?
He said he'll come back.
-Why'd you have to let him in? -I don't know.
Brother.
SO? CAN YOU STILL TAKE IT? BRING APYONG TO THIS LOCATION.
Erika.
As soon as Yanni wakes up tomorrow, get out of the house.
Get away from Manila.
-What? -Go to bank and get some cash.
Then text me where you're going so I can follow. Understood?
Okay, I will.
Are you all right, brother?
Tell me if you have a problem.
-I'm fine. -Are you sure?
Yeah.
Brother, did you fight with someone?
No.
Just do it.
Be careful, brother.
Sir, here's the live ammo you requested.
Sign here, sir.
Right here.
Where? It's all filled out.
Wait, sir. I'll get a new sheet.
You motherfucker.
Let's see if you can take this.
Okay, slow down.
Stop.
Bring Apyong now.
Stop, don't move.
What's this?
Move.
Hey! It's still here!
Like I thought, it's still here.
He's been shot several times.
You shot him, right?
Yes, I shot him.
Then, boom! You ran him over.
So, which one of us killed him?
Is it still important now, Villon?
Are we done?
You want a receipt?
Villon.
Fuck!
I thought we were done, man?
Fuck! Then go right ahead and shoot me.
If you kill me now, you'll be dead tomorrow.
I've been a cop for 10 years, man.
Would I come here without an insurance?
I made a report of all your crimes.
Everything you've done!
All the details of your drug deals, bar operation…
And what you did to Apyong and Arturo. Everything.
So go ahead, shoot me.
Because for sure, you'll be in jail tomorrow.
Shoot me now.
-That's it? -Go ahead. What now?
Shit, bro.
Go on, shoot me.
Shoot me.
Go on, shoot me!
If you're not gonna use it man, then keep it!
Kill me!
I can still use you, Villon.
We're in this together.
Why not just join me?
You're my accomplice, anyway.
Join the big league.
Leave the small-time cons to your colleagues.
Do it for Yanni.
Hey, shoot me! Shoot me!
Go on, shoot! Shoot me!
If you're not gonna shoot me, then put away your gun!
Fuck! Man, you're good!
I'm your fan, pretty boy!
You impressed me there, man!
So?
Think about what I said, Villon. Okay?
-So, did you think about it? -Yeah.
-Let's talk about it, Villon. -Okay.
You'll fit right in, man!
Your skills.
Your spunk and strength.
-You have it in you! -Yeah.
Plus, your acting ability fucking floored me!
-Okay, man? -Yeah, okay.
-Yes? -Okay, okay, yes.
-Yeah! Rock 'n roll! -Okay, bye.
Rock 'n roll!
-Hello, Erica? -Hello, Brother.
What time will you come here?
I'm about to leave now.
I'll pass by the station first, then I'll go straight there.
How's Yanni? Is she having fun?
Yeah, she's having a blast.
Wait, I'll call her.
Yanni, your dad called.
The station first, then here.
-Hello, Papa. -Hello, baby.
Happy Birthday.
Papa, what time are you coming here?
I'm about to leave now.
-See you soon. -Okay.
Hurry up.
Love you.
Love you, baby.
Good, you're still here.
I caught up to you.
Thank God.
Were you surprised?
I was surprised, too.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here!
Throwing stuff now?
Still fighting back?
You're nothing.
So?
You motherfucker.
Just wait and see, you filthy animal.
You think you're the boss?
Fuck you.
You can't win over me, idiot!
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
You think you can take me on?
-You can't handle me, idiot. -Come at me!
You want me?
Fuck you!
Motherfucker.
You think you can take me on?
Fuck you.
What now?
-Fuck you. -What?
What?
Wow! Heavy!
You're still up?
Hey!
You think I'll leave you alive? Think again, fucker.
Idiot.
What now?
So?
Hey! Still alive?
Still fighting!
I see, It's not game over yet!
Come here. Come here.
Let's see what you got.
Come out!
You want to play?
Villon!
You want more, Villon?
Villon!
Villon!
Villon!
You can't escape from me.
Fuck you, Villon!
Let me go, Villon! Villon!
Get back here or else… You'll have a taste of-- Let me go!
Can you still dance?
You won't get out of there. Just stay there!
You're done for!
That's mine!
That's mine!
That's mine!
That's mine!
Son of a bitch!
You stink!
Fuck you!
Robbery,
extortion,
drugs,
homicide,
hit-and-run.
and covering up the evidence.
The worst.
Rotten.
Rotten to the core.
This will bury us all.
Especially when news comes out.
This should never get out.
Why did this happen,
when the new PNP Chief just took office?
This is so humiliating.
Truly humiliating.
I understand how you feel.
But life is just like that, Villon.
A year passes so fast.
Relax.
After you're done thinking,
go back to being a cop.
You did well
in giving your separation pay to Arturo's mother.
That's a big help to them.
But what other job can you do aside from being a cop?
Who knows? There are many jobs out there.
I'll find something to do.
Just think about it, Villon.
I'll delay the approval of your resignation.
It's okay.
Thank you, Chief.
Can you do it?
You guys be careful.
You've been playing for a long time.
Brother, what do you want to eat? Healthy or not?
This one's mine.
She's fine.
-She's almost riding it. -She can do it.
-Brother. -Yeah?
What do you plan to do now that you're no longer a cop?
Well, I plan to buy a secondhand food truck.
-Why a food truck? -Let's buy a food truck first.
Once we've saved up enough, we can open up a pastry shop.
-That can work. -Yes!
-You're sure? Promise? -Yeah, I'm sure.
Then, I can talk to Chief.
Believe me, this is a good idea.
A lot of people there.
Do you remember the place I used to frequent outside?
-The food's delicious. -Yes, the one near the fishball stall.
That's a busy area.
-There's a store there, right? -Yeah.
That spot is what I'll ask for.
-Okay, that's a good spot. -Yeah, the one on the right.
Hope it goes well.
Yeah and I already spoke with the seller of the truck.
What did he say?
He said okay…
Fifty percent down.
Fifty percent is big.
Do you want some more?
What do you want?
-Yes, sir? -Private Piggy Bank?
This way, sir.
Boss, a client's here.
Hey, man.
The key?
Boss.
-Will you withdraw? -Yes.
How much?
Everything.
-Everything? -Yeah.
Okay.
-Go with him. -Yes, boss.
This way, sir.
My father also lost his life while performing a suicide attack.
I have a brother, but he is scared.
I am not sad about doing this!
I must press this button, not the other one.
My last wish
is for my brother to follow the same path.
He must choose jihad.
-Go! -Come on!
-Kick it! -Take it from him!
They ran away!
Let's go.
I will just do it.
-Hey! Don't shoot! -Don't shoot!
-He's just a kid. -Chocolate?
Baaz!
Baaz!
-No! -Go! Leave for now!
Time is a great healer.
Go. Go now.
-Stay away! -Stay away!
Allah is the greatest.
-This woman is a suicide bomber! -It's an ambush!
NO ONE IS WORTHY OF WORSHIP EXCEPT ALLAH AND MOHAMMAD IS HIS MESSENGER
Greetings. May the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be with you.
I am Abdullah Qazar.
I am the commander of the area from Kunnar to Nooristan.
Be it Russians or Americans, everyone has been scared of this region.
To destroy this region means
to conquer Afghanistan.
These westerners are scared of us, Talibans.
We will destroy them here at their military post
and then defeat them in Kabul too.
All these outsiders
are here to rule us.
The Afghans and other countries
that support these western forces are also our enemies.
They are our targets.
Good evening, sir.
We have confirmed intel on Qazar.
The Taliban leader is in this village.
The entire area below the entry point to Khost is a Taliban stronghold.
We should bomb the village.
Sir, our people…
Sir, we have our people residing in that area.
These outsiders are demons, not human beings.
Infidels!
Every Afghan is their enemy.
Nooristan and Kabul are the slaughterhouses of Americans.
We will kill them at their own military bases.
Come on all. Get them!
Get here.
Swear to god!
We will achieve this by making our children suicide bombers.
Take out the gun.
Shut up or I will kill you.
Yes, I am just looking for him.
Excuse me, sir. Are you Mr. Nasser Khan?
Excuse me, sir.
Are you Mr. Nasser Khan?
Are you all right?
It is the last call for boarding. Please come for boarding.
I've lost my boarding card.
Hello, my friend! Welcome.
Long time no see.
Thank you for coming.
I know it was difficult for you. Thanks.
Sorry, I didn't reply to your emails and phone calls.
I know. I can understand.
I was sure you would come.
So, I never gave up hope.
-He's Abdullah. -Greetings, sir.
He'll drop you off at the guest house.
Sir, do you like shawarma and falafel?
You will not get them here anymore.
Noor-e-labab, the Lebanese restaurant, was destroyed.
Shalimar is gone too.
They made delicious biryani.
Almost 54 died.
The French restaurant, Le Jardin, was destroyed too.
But only 12 got killed there.
How many died in the Lebanese restaurant?
-Not many. Just five… -Stop the car.
Did you call me?
Five died in the Lebanese restaurant.
-And 12 in Le Jardin. -Yes.
Why?
People keep dying here and there. It's normal, sir!
Sadiq, what's going on there?
Are reporters here for interviews?
Forget that!
Those three boys from the Pakistani refugee camp
have a real cricket ball.
The one professionals use.
Really? A real cricket ball from Pakistan!
-Let me see the ball. -Please show it to me.
Please let me see it.
Please ask him to show it. We're not going to eat it up.
Show it.
Hey! Show us the ball, Baaz!
Did you steal it?
It's only been two days since you arrived and you're already stealing things!
You want to play with it,
don't you?
Hey.
I lost my red ball near the American compound.
Gulab, they stole it!
What are you saying? We got it from Pakistan.
Look at it from a distance.
It is a real one.
Afridi has used it.
He took six wickets with it.
How did you get Afridi's ball?
We got it from the match venue.
We used to watch many matches in Pakistan.
We met all the cricket players there.
We met Virat Kohli too.
Liar!
They are liars!
I swear! We have met all the players.
All the cricket teams visit Pakistan,
but they never come here.
They are scared of bomb blasts.
Who is the leader here?
Gulab-ud-din.
Gulab-ud-din.
This ball belongs to me now.
-No, Baaz. Don't! -No, Baaz!
Son of a bitch! Motherfucker!
Run!
-Did you get it? -You idiot!
What are you looking at me for? Catch him!
Come on, Baaz!
We have won it!
Oh, god!
Oh, god!
Gulab,
I suggest you resolve the matter.
Talk it out.
The ball is ours.
Get a bat if you want to play.
A real bat for a real ball. What do you say, Baaz?
Okay.
-Ali Sher. -Yes?
You get the bat
from your father's factory.
Let's go.
Gulab.
He is the Talib
who came from Pakistan last month.
His mother was a suicide bomber!
Thank you.
What do the children of Afghanistan need?
-Education. -Etiquette.
-Food. -Peace.
Peace.
Fulfilling their dreams is Tomorrow's Hope's dream.
So join us in giving these people a ray of hope.
Greetings.
In Dari we say, this is your home.
We have been experiencing this destruction for the past 30 years.
My father had sent me off to the USA when the Russians attacked.
While studying there, I had just one dream.
To come back here and work for my people.
But when I came back, the situation had worsened.
Right then, I met Meera.
She gave me courage and faith.
Tomorrow's Hope.
It is now home to about a thousand children and their families.
Meera's husband, Dr. Nasser Khan is here today.
I would like to call him on the stage.
FREEDOM
Photo?
GOD DO NOT LIKE JOBLESS PEOPLE
Sir, please don't roam around like this.
These days they are targeting Indians too.
I've survived for five years, Ayesha.
Times have changed.
So did my outlook and feelings.
I know you want to help me but those children's faces…
Ayesha, some things in life cannot be forgiven.
Nasser, everyone needs a purpose.
It was Meera's purpose in life to help these people.
Aren't you proud of her?
Please visit the refugee camp before you leave.
Her dream has given many people a new life.
Please, Nasser.
I'm leaving the day after.
Abdullah!
- Abdullah! -Yes, sir? What happened?
Where did this come from?
A man had come to meet you. He left it here.
He wanted to see you. I said you're sleeping.
-Should I call him now? -No.
Good morning, sir.
Please sit. Let me get you some tea.
Oh, no!
You broke it again!
There is nothing left to break in this house anymore.
-Give it to me. -No.
-I will break this bat! -Wait.
Don't vent it out on the bat!
I got it for him. It has the signatures of all his favorite players.
It has Dhoni's, Malinga's, and Sehwag's.
Do whatever you wish!
Let him destroy the entire house. I don't care.
I've received the official letter.
I am being posted at the embassy in Kabul.
I have to leave next Sunday.
Nasser, I am missing my work.
Afghanistan has always been on my mind.
I have always wanted to do something for the children of war!
I will open an NGO there.
I'll serve the crisis-afflicted people.
Tea for you, sir.
Bravo, Baaz!
Come on! Bowl him out.
-Come on! Bowl him out! -Bravo!
-Bravo! -Take his wicket.
Bravo, Baaz!
Catch it.
-Come on. Throw it! -How sloppy!
-Bravo, Baaz! Dismiss him! -Good bowling, Baaz!
-Pitch it at a good length. -Dismiss him!
-Go back a little. -Bravo!
-Bravo! -Well done!
Come on, Baaz!
Nasser, we run classes here.
Two shifts every day for the children.
So everyone can attend at their convenience.
The tent there is a distribution center.
That one is the medical clinic.
The entire refugee camp -has been adopted by Tomorrow's Hope. -Ayesha.
-has been adopted by Tomorrow's Hope. -Ayesha. -Yes? -We need to talk. It is urgent.
-Yes? -We need to talk. It is urgent.
Nasser, I will be back.
Bravo, Baaz! Bravo!
Come on!
Come on!
-Catch it! -It's in the air!
Hey, throw back the ball!
Hey, give it!
Give the ball back.
Can't you hear me?
Gulab, he is not giving the ball back.
-Go there and ask him. -All right.
Give back our ball!
It's a dangerous match.
We are all in a bad mood!
Gulab, he is not returning the ball.
Hey, crazy man! Give our ball back.
-Hey, run! -Get it.
Gulab, he threw our ball!
Hey!
He is here again!
Why are you back here?
Search him.
Why do you come every day?
-Come out. -Why did you come?
-Come out. -Wait.
Get aside.
Why are you here?
This is all I have of him…
Niaz!
Nice.
Let's go there.
Is it here?
Niaz!
Niaz!
Aryan!
Come here quickly. Hurry up!
Allah!
Allah!
This is painful!
Take another boy.
He is not breathing.
NATO retaliated against the Taliban attack by bombing our village.
My family
and my house were destroyed.
I didn't even realize
when somebody poisoned
his innocent mind!
Niaz would often say that Aryan
resembled his younger brother.
He loved him dearly.
A lot.
Please forgive me!
Please forgive my Niaz.
Your son, Niaz, was a good boy.
May Allah bless us with a kind and patient heart.
Why so much hatred?
What’s wrong with your beings?
Torn from their branches
They are trampled in dirt
Have mercy on these innocent flowers
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!
Have mercy
-Abdullah, shift it a little. -Sure.
Shift it.
To the left. Move it.
Keep it straight.
Shift.
Put it there to the left.
-Make it straight. -Nasser.
Thank God, I thought you left.
How could I?
The office needs to be set up.
Ayesha.
People say militants
are scared of American air and drone attacks.
But no.
You are doing something that's scaring them!
I am with you.
You're mad!
May I get a job at Tomorrow's Hope?
I am a qualified doctor.
Why don't you play football with them?
I can't kick the ball hard.
But I am good at cricket.
I am a cricket-lover too.
-We will play together one day. Okay? -Okay.
Yes, Afghanistan is going to create history
if they can beat former champions like Sri Lanka,
West Indies, Pakistan, and India.
What do you say?
Bless you. God bless you, kids.
Bless you.
Consider this your own home. Sit down.
Here.
Yes!
What a shot!
Come.
-Bravo! What a shot! -Amazing.
Afghanistan cricket team's victory
has kindled hope and happiness among the locals.
This is a proud moment for the entire nation.
More problems in the world should be solved
by playing cricket matches instead of fighting wars.
Before the match, the Taliban spokesperson called up the cricket board
and wished good luck to the team
-Hip hip… -…hooray!
Gulab.
He's the same guy
who had thrown our ball away!
I know he is eyeing our playground.
He got his team along today.
Mr. Nasser.
Hey.
Amazing!
Where have you brought us to play the match?
Playing in the open is more fun.
-Hi, Bill. -Hi, there.
-Let's go and play. Are you ready? -Yes.
-Come on. -Let's go!
Listen, Baaz.
Listen, Baaz. A lot of Americans and outsiders
have come to our camp.
They are playing cricket at our ground.
Ball, bat, and pad.
They have everything.
And the one you wear inside your underwear for protection.
They have a real leather ball.
I love it.
I love their bat more.
If I get it,
I can become a great batsman!
-Hey! -Come on, Bill!
Such awful players!
We play without shoes and gear,
and we are still better than them.
Throw the ball!
Catch it.
-Throw it! -Out! Yes!
-Yes! -Well done!
Gulab, ask them if we can play.
Come on!
Howzat!
This side…
Ask him. Go.
Howzat!
Why didn't you?
-You should have asked. -Go, ask him.
-Sir! -Hey!
Come on.
It's your face! He didn't even hear you.
-Pitch the ball. -Yes.
Yes.
-Bravo! Very good! -A six!
-Nasser. -Come on.
It was a good game!
It was fun!
Will they play every day, Gulab?
-Sadiq. -Yes?
-Will they let us play today? -God knows.
Should we ask?
It was a high one.
Let Abdullah bowl.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Sir, take us on the team.
It is our ground.
It's public ground. Anyone can play here.
Go sit over there.
Go on.
Dear God! He hits a six every time!
Hey, motherfucker!
Hey, motherfucker!
He called you.
Hey, kid! Don't say that.
Come here.
-Do you all want to play? -Yes.
-Do you? -Yes.
Go there.
-Hooray! -Go on.
Come on.
What's your name?
Gulab.
-Will you bowl? -Sure.
-Come on, pal! -Hey!
Come, if you want to play.
What?
We don't want to play with you guys!
Sir, let me bowl as well!
-Do you want to? -Yes.
Give him the ball.
Come on, let's go. This is rubbish!
Let's go.
He is bowling really well. Come on, Fareed, hit it.
Let's play, Baaz.
No, we won't. Come.
Hey, you!
Come hurry up!
We trained them in Pakistan.
You have to find these boys for us.
Our camp was attacked by the American forces,
the families of these boys took this chance and brought them here.
We know
they are hiding in the refugee camps here.
They are our soldiers.
Our own people should help us!
It is your duty
towards your country, your faith, and your people.
Allah does not approve of your ways.
These are children.
You are misusing the name jihad, the holy fight against evil.
Jihad is sanctified to protect the innocent and weak.
I cannot commit such a sin.
The holy command is only for those
who carry faith to follow through!
Allah, please,
I said it for your sake.
I said kind words.
Children.
Today, you don't have to target the blocks.
Shoot here.
Shoot on the head!
Shut up!
One!
Two!
Three!
Some special kahwah for you.
Afghani kahwah.
Afghani kahwah and Afghani cricket team
are both incomparable.
India, Pakistan and all other teams are nothing in front of Afghanistan!
I mean, the Indian team is good. But no one else can do that.
A six!
I have seen courage in their hearts
and dreams in their eyes.
They are looking for a chance.
I want to start a cricket training camp
for children of the refugee camp.
They will be trained
and readied for selection.
Good players will be admitted to the Kabul Cricket Club.
With God's grace,
they may even get to play in the national team someday.
They are orphans,
homeless,
and have lost everything!
Nobody helped them. So what?
The dreams are ours,
the efforts should also be ours.
Despite such odds,
you are standing tall.
I've also lost my dear ones here.
Come.
Let's make a new beginning together.
So, tell me…
Who is a good batsman?
-It's me! -I can!
-Me! -Me!
Bowler?
-Me! -Me!
Gulab is the best batsman!
But Ali Sher bowled him out.
He is a great spinner.
Dear, God!
They are already fighting. You handle them now.
You handle them now.
Baaz or I will be the captain.
Come here, Baaz.
Hey, are you crazy?
He is talking nonsense!
There is no better player than Gulab in this refugee camp.
There is. Baaz is better.
Baaz!
This Talib doesn't have the courage to fight me.
He is a Talib!
A Taliban supporter!
He says Taliban want progress for our country.
If you kill the infidel, you'll go to heaven.
The Americans make our own Afghan army fight against the Taliban.
They make Afghans fight each other.
Son of a bitch! What are you telling him? Talk to me!
You're the son of a Talibani.
Your entire family was Talibani!
Your father, uncle…
And your father!
He was a coward. A traitor.
He was a policeman.
The Taliban killed him.
I'll grow up to be an army captain
and kill Talibanis like you.
I will grow up to be a Taliban.
And kill cowards and traitors like you.
His mother was also a Taliban supporter. She was a murderer.
A holy warrior
not a murderer.
She is a martyr!
Come on.
Hey, stop! Where are you going?
We are ready to fight!
A holy warrior is not afraid of anybody!
I have my parents' permission.
I will cut the enemy's throat.
Allah is with us.
My blood is raging.
I will tear the enemy apart
with a bomb
and with this knife!
I have my parent's blessings!
I will cut their throats, will attack every enemy,
and destroy them.
Baaz!
Baaz.
Do you want a ride?
Baaz.
Want a ride?
Baaz.
Stop. Baaz, stop.
You do not like me.
Outsiders are not to be trusted!
Go back to where you came from.
I am from India.
I've heard you are a terrific player.
A fast-bowler and a superb batsman.
I've heard you used to be in the army.
Yes, I was.
I was a doctor.
I helped people and saved their lives.
The world has its eyes fixed on the Afghan team.
Their victory has left everyone awestruck.
I need a player like you.
There is no better player than Baaz in this camp.
Even in Pakistan, he was the best.
Shut up!
Listen, come for the practice.
You will go far.
At least come and watch, okay?
Hey, Baaz, it's 2 p.m. okay?
It was a close save!
He doesn't know how to hold a bat!
Coach.
What's all this? They are worthless! We are the good players.
Yes, Coach. Let us play.
Don't waste our time!
Shut up!
Go, practice.
Practice catching! Go!
-Come on! -They can't play!
-Hit a six. -Nasser…
The boy from the Pakistani refugee camp will be a good player.
These kids can't do it.
I've told you repeatedly! Bat and pad.
Keep the bat and pad aligned.
There shouldn't be any gap.
Don't you get it? How will you play?
-Play well, okay? -Sure, Coach.
He is dying to play.
But such ego…
They are Pashtuns.
Win their heart and they'll sacrifice their life for you.
I don't want their life.
I want to form a team.
Very good!
Gulab will be
our opening batsman.
Khosh Bakht!
Give the ball back!
Stay.
Let's see
if he will pick up the ball.
-Hey! -Hey!
Why did you throw away the ball?
How dare you do that to Gulab?
Hey, Talib!
Looks like your time is over!
Should I send you to hell to be with your mother and father?
Come here, you son of a bitch!
I'll parade you naked.
-Hey! -Let me go.
Calm down!
Focus on the game!
Today is the last day for selection.
Tomorrow, children from outside will come and play with you.
They are great players.
Go practice!
What?
He's Wahid and he's Imlal.
Very dangerous bowler!
Lovely high-arm action.
He is gifted with pace and aggression.
Mind your head while playing!
-What's this, Coach? -What?
They're Hazaras. We're Pathans. Pashtun.
We can't play with them.
Why not?
They're players too.
Gulab, you go and bat first!
-Are you scared? -Coach!
You're an outsider,
you don't understand our culture.
The Pashtuns and Hazaras are archenemies.
We will not play with them.
-Right, Khoda Baksh? -Yes.
I will not play either.
-What do you say, Gulab? -Yes.
-Ali Sher? -Yes. You're right.
Coach, I told you, they will not play with us.
Bloody cowards! Shame on you!
Hey, dimwit!
Who are you calling a coward?
Go, bowl!
-Sadiq, come on! -Yes.
Let's teach him a lesson.
Coach! Go sit there.
Yes, sir.
Hit it, Gulab!
Aim for his face.
-Come on, Gulab! -Good job, Gulab!
Do well, Imlal! Bravo!
What a delivery!
Good bowling.
Yes.
Come on, Gulab.
-Gulab, hit his face. -Yes.
What happened, Hazara?
You forgot how to bowl?
Loser!
Hey!
Are you all right?
Hey! What did you do?
Come on, Gulab. Get up!
Hit his face, Gulab!
Come on, Gulab!
-Out! -He's dismissed!
What?
Darn!
Get lost now.
Any other Pathan wants to play?
Gulab.
Him!
Talib is here.
He picked up the bat!
Wow!
Gulab, he lost the ball again!
Stupid! He hit a sixer!
-Wow! -Amazing!
Horray!
Yes!
-Baaz. -Come here, Gulab and Baaz.
Shake hands.
Fuck you.
Motherfucker!
Hey. No need for such words, kid.
Leave it.
Leave it!
Get lost now!
Yes!
It's okay. Don't be sad!
Baaz hit the shot, and the fielder missed.
The ball crosses the rope!
The next delivery. Baaz hits it again.
What a shot!
Can we talk?
I will not join your team.
He's my son, Aryan.
He also loved cricket.
He would be about your age now.
Where's he? In India?
Up there.
With his mother.
God is quick to call the good ones up there.
I haven't seen destruction like you.
But I can understand the pain of losing loved ones.
This talent and this life
that you have now,
it's a gift from God.
Don't throw it away!
You are a good player.
-Hey, here. -Come on!
Quiet!
He's here.
-Keep quiet! -Hey!
-Good morning. -Good morning.
-Hello. -Hello.
-We are strong. -We are strong.
I speak Pashto too.
What's this, Coach?
It's an oxygen mask. Here.
I believe we can make a formidable team.
And for that, we need some more formidable players.
People shouldn't say that boys from refugee camps can't play.
-Absolutely! -Yes, sir.
-Abdullah! -Yes, sir?
-Yes, sir. -Imlal and Wahid.
Imlal and Wahid.
Come on.
Wahid and Imlal will play for our team.
Coach.
Playing against them is fine.
But we can't play on the same team.
Their stature is lower than us Pathans!
-Coach I told you, they are vile! -Hey!
-Hey! -Mind your tongue!
-Hey! -Calm down! Stop it!
What nonsense is this?
I want a good team. That's all!
Coach.
Your job is to train us!
Don't meddle in our affairs
-Okay? -He's right. They can't play.
Okay.
So I am just a coach!
Why should I waste my time on you then?
-Let's go, Abdullah. -Coach.
Coach.
-Coach! -Coach!
Coach!
Gulab, let's practice by ourselves.
Coach is upset. I don't think he will come.
You always talk crap, Sadiq!
Why did you say such rude things in front of him?
Why? You also didn't want to play with the Hazaras.
-Let us in. -Let us in.
-Let us in. -Quiet!
Kids!
-Let us. -What's this noise? No!
-We want to meet the coach. -There's no coach here.
-Coach! -Stop them! Go away!
-Coach! -Stop them!
-Coach! -Go away!
What are you doing here?
Forgive us, Coach. Fellow Afghans are brothers.
Go away!
You idiot! Shut up!
-Pashtuns and Hazaras are brothers! -We are all like brothers.
-We are brothers. -We are brothers.
-We are all like brothers. -Pashtuns and Hazaras are brothers.
Okay. Don't waste your time here. Go, practice!
-Tomorrow's the test. -Yes. Let's go.
-Come on. -Let's go. Yes.
-I'll bat. -Come on.
This boy doesn't leave my mind.
He was so little
when he saw his mother make the ultimate sacrifice.
Western powers should not forget
that Afghanistan is the land of Allah.
These children are like fierce desert storms
that will destroy the enemy.
It's written on their faces
that these falcons will rise again.
In the name of Allah.
-He is the greatest! -He is the greatest!
In the name of Allah.
-He is the greatest! -He is the greatest!
In the name of Allah.
-He is the greatest! -He is the greatest!
I am a black falcon!
So am I!
This machine will throw balls now? What about bowlers then?
Sir.
Welcome. I am Shariyar Khan.
-Greetings. -The head coach, -Kabul Cricket Academy. Have a seat. -Sure.
-Kabul Cricket Academy. Have a seat. -Sure.
-So you are from India, right? -Yes.
Tell me. What can I do for you?
The children from the refugee camp…
They are really talented.
They are good players, not scared of losing.
They need to learn the techniques.
I've disciplined them to an extent.
I'd be thankful if you could coach them.
Look, Mr. Nasser,
I am a frank person.
These children from the refugee camp,
their mindset is not right.
They grow up hearing
if you do a suicide attack, you'll be sent to heaven.
You are wasting your time.
Take my advice. Stay away from this mess!
I'm a frank person too.
Let me be straight with you.
I will train these children
and they will make a great team, you'll see.
Hey. I am sorry.
Don't get upset.
I am just trying to give you good advice.
I can bet, one of these days
one of the boys will strap a bomb on his body
and kill himself and many innocent people.
Mr. Shariyar,
let's make this bet.
My team will play against your team.
If we defeat your under-16 team,
you'll train them at your academy.
If we lose,
I'll pay you 4,000 dollars.
Challenge accepted, Mr. Nasser!
I'll see you on the field.
-Greetings. -Greetings.
-Greetings. -Greetings.
Listen up.
-He's Harpal, sir. I call him Billu. -Billu.
He will coach you from now on.
-Greetings, Coach. -Greetings.
-Are you Pashtun? -Yes.
A Punjabi Pakhtun! Go run six laps! Go!
-Run! Come on! -Start!
Sir, Afghanistan?
It is a dangerous place! Why are you doing this?
Chill! It's not that bad.
No. I have made arrangements.
-What? -Look!
What the hell man?
Here, balance your front foot, okay?
Very good, Gulab.
Sit on your toes.
Oh, hey!
Hey!
Listen, sir.
They need proper gear, equipment, and a special diet.
Can we arrange for sponsorship?
Obaid, can you do something?
Obaid told me cricket is popular worldwide.
I also watch it on TV.
Here. This is a photo of our boss!
Use it on your team banner.
I'll also talk to Shariyar
and arrange access to the Kabul academy to train for a few hours.
Thanks a lot, sir.
Try touching the nose.
Come on! Quick!
Harder. Come on!
Only if you work hard, you will get selected. Understood?
Bravo!
Last night, a NATO airstrike targeted a Taliban hideout
in the mountainous region near Kabul.
According to sources, senior Taliban commander
Mullah Mohammed Qazar and his associate Habibullah Khan
were present at the hideout
and both were killed during the airstrike.
I seek refuge in God From Satan the accursed
Allah, the eternal refuge He neither begets nor is born
Nor is there to Him any equivalent
Thy Lord is Holy and clear Of all that is alleged against Him
And He is exalted
May the peace of Allah Be upon the Messengers
Traitors and westerners are sitting fearlessly in Kabul.
We will kill them in their stronghold!
Greetings! May God's mercy and blessings be upon you.
Recently the western forces made another attack on us.
They are spreading rumors that I, Abdullah Qazar,
and Commander Habibullah have died in the attack.
We don't die.
We achieved martyrdom.
Our spirits are high and resolve is unshaken.
We will hit back hard!
This is a message for those who are trying to destroy Taliban.
The day Taliban is destroyed,
this country and the whole world will burn!
People who call us suicide attackers are ignorant fools.
We are martyrdom seekers, holy warriors!
And it is a matter of pride for us.
We will put restrictions on everything.
Cinema, music. There will be attacks everywhere.
In Herat, Kunduz,
American military posts.
Kabul will bleed now.
Switch on the TV, sir! There have been blasts in the city.
There's destruction everywhere.
Today, 20km towards the west of the Afghan capital,
40 people were killed in an attack.
Sources say it was a suicide attack.
It targeted freshly-graduated policemen.
It was a suicide attack aimed at police officers.
Baaz!
Come inside.
Yes!
Baaz, give the ball back!
Allah.
Light up the lives of these children
with your blessings.
Amen.
-Greetings. -Greetings.
-Greetings, Coach. -Sit down.
Today I have brought the video recording of an amazing match.
Where are Baaz, Khosh Bakht, and Bakht?
-They didn't come today. -Are they?
Why? Go call them.
Coach, they have not been around since yesterday.
Bakht's uncle and cousin came yesterday
and those three went with them.
Nobody has seen them ever since.
Look.
Tell them not to miss practice sessions.
The final match is close. Okay?
Coach, there are boys from another camp who can play.
Should I call them?
Should I replace you?
No, Coach.
Greetings.
Allah is great!
Those with determination and an unshakable faith
will never be deterred from their path.
You disappointed me, Baaz.
Your mother used to say
one life should be for action!
Mere thoughts are not enough.
This life you are so proud of
is dirt!
A falcon
doesn't get deterred in the storm.
What will you say
when Allah questions you on the judgment day?
You will be ashamed.
Your father and mother will be ashamed.
I always aspired
to make the ultimate sacrifice.
But someone told me,
you take away lives.
Your questions are valid, Baaz.
And difficult too.
But I will answer
all your questions.
Hail Allah.
Hail Allah.
Some of you are already trained.
Bravo!
The two must always be together.
Nothing.
The house is empty.
I will talk to others.
Okay?
Don't worry. We'll find the boys.
Okay? Let's go there.
Why this destruction everywhere?
Where has the peace gone?
Who planted explosives in your garden?
Who has cursed this fate on mankind?
Why painful screams Of the innocent fill the air?
Why are they suffering?
Where will this injustice end?
Torn from their branches
They are trampled in dirt
Have mercy on these young flowers
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord! Have mercy
Greetings. Mr. Nasser, how are you?
Greetings, Ms. Ayesha. How are you?
He's Mr. Nasser. A close friend.
He is doing a good work in our country.
How are you?
Many come here promising to hold our hand.
All of them leave.
He's a friend too.
I'm thinking of appealing to the Afghan government
to close down all detention centers,
and youth remand homes
and open cricket clubs instead.
Children living in refugee camps are not terrorists.
In fact, they are the first victims of terrorism.
Put bats in their hands and see the magic.
Terrorists don't want progress.
They don't want these children to choose the path of progress.
Nasser.
Here, try this. Afghanistan's special Kebab.
Obaid.
I need your help.
Tell me.
I want to meet Qazar.
It's extremely dangerous.
Let me see what I can do.
-Greetings. -Greetings.
Nasser, he's Ali. He will help us.
I REFUSE TO RUN
Greetings.
I want to meet Qazar.
I want to talk to him
about these kids.
Uncle!
Stop.
I will kill you today!
You want the boys.
You want those children? They are my lions.
My soldiers.
They belong to me!
Stop it.
Quiet.
-Leave him. -Okay.
Such madness!
What's your intention?
I like cricket.
But these children are our soldiers.
They have been trained for a bigger purpose.
I've heard a lot about you.
The people of Afghanistan dread you.
The common man and the army.
But I am not scared of you.
These innocent children deserve
the small joys of childhood.
Their innocence died the day
they saw their homes and families destroyed.
These western powers
have given us such pain. They have destroyed our generations!
Even Allah says, "don't snatch someone's dreams."
These children need
hope and faith.
In hope of a better life
and to serve justice,
we've sacrificed everything.
We are hiding here and fighting!
What's your motive? To make them play cricket?
Or do you intend to do something else?
You pray five times to seek fulfillment of your purpose.
And I pray five times…
for the happiness of these children.
Let's see whose prayer is granted.
You are a different kind of crazy!
But I can't accept your request.
Every country, every man, wants you dead.
I'm not here to defeat you.
I want to win you over.
These children deserve a chance.
They have worked so hard for this match.
The Taliban also play cricket.
We like it.
I like bowling.
You are a kind person, fearless, and courageous.
My heart says
I should forgive you.
Their life is dedicated to a higher purpose.
Don't misguide them.
Go back to your country
and let these children serve their faith!
If their faith is real,
they will remain true to it.
But if it's shaken, it wasn't their faith but your indoctrination!
Just one match.
This match can become an example!
Just one.
The world will be watching it.
The media will cover these refugee kids as they take on a professional team.
Entire Afghanistan will watch them.
Just one match, Qazar.
Calm down. Let go!
Just one.
Okay. But make it quick. Hold the match this Friday.
Don't forget your purpose.
Here.
Catch it.
Baaz, where were you?
Practice catching.
Come on, Gulab!
Baaz!
What's wrong with him?
-What happened to the Talib? -I don't know!
Sir.
I want to talk to you.
The coach has called me,
Baaz, and Khosh Bakht to the mosque to offer prayers.
Sit here.
Go, but remember this.
Our fight is our highest purpose.
Ours is a different world.
Listen.
Tell your coach not to act smart.
We are keeping an eye on him.
Do you understand?
We want to tell the whole world.
That NATO and the Americans
have forcefully attacked
and occupied
our country.
And unfortunately,
our own Afghan army
is against our mission to destroy them.
We have an idea about those refugee boys.
Okay, we know they probably met with Qazar and his men.
And they're probably meeting with militant groups right now.
NATO and the Afghan army are against us!
They hate our holy warriors!
Their opposition has made our youth's resolve stronger.
That's why our educated youth is also joining this fight against non-believers.
And this Nasser, he's completely crazy!
Okay, this whole cricket match, I'm thinking, was a bad idea.
We have created an army against the enemy,
that is eager to die for the cause.
Our next generations will be told stories of our valor and sacrifice.
I trust those boys. They cannot hurt anybody.
Khan, they are trained soldiers!
They're just innocent boys
who are being entrapped.
I hope you are right. I really do.
Even just for a moment of attention,
we must make noise everyday.
Sure.
My house was beautiful.
We lived atop a mountain.
But the entire family was wiped off in just a day!
It's nothing but a burial ground now.
Our village was under attack for many days.
When the fighting subsided,
Mother sent us to the shop to get some food.
Dodging bullets was an everyday affair.
I thought my brother tripped.
He was lying on the ground.
My uncle told me it was a foreign soldier.
Mother always taught me
to be noble,
to hurt no one.
And one day…
People call me Talib.
I was told
being a self-sacrificing soldier is the ultimate cause.
I lost Aryan and Meera here.
I saw their smiles
for the last time here.
When I sleep,
it all feels like a nightmare.
I talk to them. Play cricket with Aryan.
It feels as if they are alive.
But when I open my eyes…
I am as heartbroken about Niaz's death
as Aryan's.
Over 2,000 people are here to watch the match.
This is a very unique match because for many
it's a symbol of hope and pride, especially for the young kids.
We are so excited that from our beloved and friendly country India,
this guy has come
to guide our Afghani kids
towards peace and harmony.
We would like to extend our gratitude to him.
He's an ex-army colonel.
He taught these refugee children to play cricket.
-Come on, boys! -Good! He is a noble soul.
Kabul Juniors has won the toss.
Bravo!
People from faraway places have come to see the new Afghanistan.
To watch these children play
in this violence-ridden country,
such moments of joy are indeed rare.
It is your victory, Baaz.
Go! Come on!
It's a cakewalk for us! Bravo!
Bowl well, Imlal.
Imlal is the opening bowler from team Torbaaz.
His first delivery…
A wide ball
Come on! Do better.
Played on the leg-side towards the boundary.
It's with Ali Sher.
A chance for a run-out. A lost chance!
It's a no-ball.
The batting side gets a free-hit.
Bravo, Imlal!
Another wide.
The next one.
And that's a six!
Torbaaz has conceded 11 runs in just 2 balls.
Listen to me.
Team Torbaaz is concerned.
Captain Gulab looks stressed.
Catch it!
All that discussion was of no use.
-Another no-ball because of overstepping. -What are you doing?
Team Torbaaz looks nervous.
-Catch it! -Another boundary!
They are not able to.
Team Kabul Juniors stands at
20 runs without any loss.
Khosh Bakht is the next bowler.
Come on!
This match seems like a one-way street.
You are right, sir.
Catch it.
Today is a bad day!
It is a magnificent sweep-shot.
A boundary. Kabul Juniors have scored 42 without any loss.
Another boundary. The score is 53 runs in 5 overs.
I will bowl.
I will.
Let me bowl.
I want to.
A small kid is the next bowler.
A wide ball!
An extra four runs!
Useless drama!
The situation is tense in the city.
Keep an eye on these refugee children.
I have heard there are many sympathizers in their camp.
Mr. Shariyar, we are doing our job.
Please worry about yours.
Your team could get in trouble.
Sadiq is bowling!
Out!
Torbaaz claims their first wicket! Kabul Juniors 58 at a loss of 1.
Sadiq tricked the batsman!
The batsman could not read it.
Doesn't look like losing a wicket has affected them.
The vice-captain, Baaz, is an all-rounder.
-He's the bowler. Let's see. -Howzat?
-Howzat? -Hey!
Close one!
The next delivery.
He claims the wicket. Baaz strikes!
Kabul Juniors is at 103 runs at a loss of 2.
Up next is Imlal. Let's see what Imlal does now.
The next one.
It is a marvelous catch!
The score is 140 runs at a loss of 3.
Bravo!
A strong appeal. A dismissal! The fourth one!
What a fightback! Imlal eyes a hat-trick.
He does it! A hat-trick!
Imlal has fought back in style!
Amazing performance by Imlal.
It is high in the air.
A fielder is following it.
A catch! Dismissal!
Torbaaz is on fire!
The score is 149 for 6.
Another dismissal! It's at 156 for 7.
Catch it! Come on!
Hooray!
It's now 164 for 9.
Amazing! That's superb.
At 165, Kabul Juniors have lost all their wickets and their final score
is 165.
It's a tough task for Team Torbaaz to chase a score of 166.
-Watch the ball, play the shot. Okay? -Absolutely!
Mr. Nasser.
Your team is playing really well.
Thank you.
-I'm sorry to hear about your brother. -Torbaaz!
Afghanistan has become a graveyard.
People like us have donned the uniform
to try and bring peace.
As I said, it is going to be a tough match. Especially since Team Torbaaz is facing professional players.
Especially since Team Torbaaz is facing professional players.
A boundary to start with!
They are good players!
Run!
-A dismissal! -Howzat!
Torbaaz is one wicket down! They are now at five for one.
Bravo!
What's happening?
What's happening, umpire?
-What's happening? -What's this, Nasser?
-What's happening? -What's this, Nasser? He's a good batsman but needs a runner.
What's this? This is cricket. This is not done.
If he's handicapped, let him stay home!
-This is unfair. -How will he run?
Let him stay home. Why make him play?
The batsman has to run himself.
Looks like the umpire is not in favor of Wahid.
Wahid must run himself.
Captain Gulab is batting magnificently.
Amazing! He's on fire.
Wahid's shot landed in the fielder's hands.
He's misfielded!
Wahid can't run. Gulab has to go back.
What a throw at the bowler's end.
Out! A wonderful run-out!
Now Torbaaz is at 38 for 2.
Kabul Junior was at 103 for 2.
They are already two down.
Bravo, Baaz!
-Baaz! -Baaz!
-The vice-captain is here. -Baaz!
Let's see what he does.
A six off the first delivery!
He's boosted his team's morale.
Come on!
Wahid can't run well. Hope he doesn't affect Baaz's game.
He's doing it.
Baaz hits another six!
Wahid's lofty shot…
Oh, dear! And he's out.
Wahid is out.
Torbaaz is at 58 for 3.
Coach, I must go.
They are in trouble.
-Yes. Ali Sher! -Yes?
-Come back. -Yes.
Imlal, you go.
Imlal scores a six!
He's in good form!
He needs to maintain this.
Imlal can't seem to stop! Another six!
Yes!
Imlal hits another six.
-Imlal! -Imlal!
Imlal hits in the air, there is a fielder below it.
Imlal is out!
Imlal was playing really well. He's caught.
Team Torbaaz at 98 for 4. It's disappointing.
Khosh Bakht is the next batsman.
-Do you know the meaning of Khosh Bakht? -Tell me…
His name means good luck.
Good luck.
It means good fortune.
He is living up to his name.
The audience is all pumped-up.
Two adept batsmen on the pitch.
Kabul Juniors are in trouble.
They are both playing well.
Khosh Bakht comes down the pitch and hits a boundary!
-Torbaaz! -Torbaaz!
-Torbaaz! -Torbaaz!
Bowled!
He couldn't read the ball.
Torbaaz is at 138 for 5.
Khosh Bakht… your good luck is gone, sir.
Yes, but the next one is Bakht.
Good is gone but luck is still with us.
Just a few balls left. 28 runs left to score.
He takes a single. Now, Baaz is on strike.
Come on.
-Baaz calls a second run. Bakht refuses. -No, Baaz, go back.
-Wow! -Run!
A boundary!
Bravo!
Yes!
The next one, he's hit!
He seems injured.
Everything's fine.
The next one.
Out!
He's out on the last bowl of the 19th over.
Torbaaz is 145 for 6.
They need 21 runs off the last over.
It's 21 runs off 6 balls.
-Sadiq is on the pitch. -Sadiq.
Baaz is on strike. They will need 21 runs off 6 balls to win.
First ball of the over. He strikes a boundary!
-It's 17 off 5 balls now. -Good! Very good, Baaz!
Keep it up.
Next one.
A straight drive and a six-down long-off.
Baaz just wants to finish it off.
Just 11 runs off 4 balls is needed now.
What's this? Pitch it fully.
Target the legs.
A call for a couple.
-Baaz! -Sadiq says no!
I called for a couple. Don't you get it?
It would've been a dismissal.
-Torbaaz! -Torbaaz!
-Torbaaz! -Torbaaz!
Go!
Ten off three balls and Sadiq is on strike.
The next one.
Sadiq has hit it and has taken a single.
He left the bat!
Nine runs off two balls. Baaz is on strike.
The next one.
He hits it.
Bravo! A six!
It was a decisive delivery.
Three runs off one ball needed.
Be with me, Lord.
Come on!
Run!
-Hit it! -A chance for a run-out.
Out!
Kabul Juniors has won it!
Bravo!
Not out! What!
-Run, Sadiq! -Umpire says it's not out!
An overthrow. Sadiq runs for another one.
They are running the third one.
They completed the run…
And Torbaaz won!
Kabul Juniors could have never imagined it!
Congratulations to Team Torbaaz!
Wow!
What a feat these refugee children have achieved!
Entire Afghanistan will remember this match.
Absolutely, sir.
Baaz.
Baaz.
-Have you seen Baaz? -He must be here, somewhere.
Hey, Baaz.
Run!
Come quickly!
Run! Hurry up! Run faster.
Almas?
Come over here!
Go faster.
Get that boy up.
Go to the other side.
Over here!
Come here as fast as you can.
Coach.
Don't do it, Baaz.
Everything will be fine. I am here.
Don't do it.
Come as fast as you can.
It will be fine.
Come over here. Take the right side.
In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.
In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.
Mother would've been proud of me today.
In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.
In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.
Run faster.
This match was the best moment of my life.
Why should we, children, sacrifice every time?
Habibullah is ready for the sacrifice.
What are you doing here, Baaz?
What are you doing, Baaz?
Go there.
Your resolve is firm.
Fulfill your objective.
I don't want to go to heaven alone.
Let's go together.
Shameless boy. Let go of me.
Baaz!
I promise
I will not let you down.
Forgive me, Coach.
I couldn't be a part of the team.
But don't be sad.
Gulab,
he'll be the best batsman ever.
And Imlal,
he's a terrific bowler.
But he's short-tempered.
Sadiq is too young,
but he's very brave.
Coach,
take care of them all.
Oh, yes.
I just saw my eldest son for the first time in a while.
He's grown so big, and he's got a strong look in his eye.
He no longer needs his father.
Let's just calm down.
Shut up!
Who the hell are you?!
I'm a housewife!
Are you okay?
Yes.
So you're Ed and Al's father. What a surprise.
I'm the one who's surprised to run into their teacher.
It seems you taught them well.
I didn't do much.
I wasn't a good father. I abandoned them.
When you left, you should have explained it to them better.
If you had, maybe they wouldn't have been so lonely
as to try resurrecting their mother.
I just didn't want to involve them.
Izumi? What's wrong?
Sig, get the car.
Hurry!
Okay.
Izumi, you met Truth?
What did you sacrifice?
Some of my organs.
I was trying to revive my dead child.
As a result, I can never get pregnant again.
I see.
I feel better.
I can't replace what you've lost, but I fixed up your organs a little.
Fixed up? Those bullets earlier…
What are you?
You returned despite opening the Gate of Truth.
That makes you quite special.
It's possible you're being targeted as a potential human sacrifice.
Targeted by whom?
The promised day is almost upon us.
If I yield to him…
this country and everyone in it will perish.
I've got a feeling this is going to be bad.
Yeah.
No… Brother.
Hey, what should I do?
How should I know?
Father will be angry.
Father? You have a father?!
I do.
The one who made the homunculi?
He knows everything.
Then he'll know where my brother went?!
Probably.
That's right.
I don't know for sure that he's dead.
Snap out of it! We promised to get our bodies back together!
Gluttony, take me to your father!
Scar, I've only just closed the wound.
I want to know the truth.
Lin!
Monster!
Kill me.
Kill me.
Split up!
Wait!
We can get out. This might be the way out!
Help us, Envy!
I didn't know there was anything like this under Central.
Those are guards.
But they won't do anything while you're with me.
If the homunculi truly do have power over this country
we'll have to do whatever we can to take back control.
Yes, sir.
First we need to determine who in Central Headquarters is friend or foe.
Mustang!
Lt. General Raven.
Hey! How's it going?
Everything is fine.
Is there something on your mind?
Nothing in particular,
but every day I'm hurt by the baseless rumors spread by the citizens.
Rumors are nothing to worry about.
But what sort of rumors?
That Scar's been feeding a black and white cat,
that an immortal person has appeared,
that Führer Bradley is a homunculus.
The citizens seem to have a lot to complain about.
It's not something to bother the top brass about.
Gentlemen.
Colonel Mustang just told me something funny.
Listen to this.
That joke you just told.
What was it?
That the Führer…
is a homunculus?
What is it, Colonel Mustang?
What if I am a homunculus?
Is that a problem?
Father!
I brought a human sacrifice.
A human sacrifice.
Who are you?
Father?!
These are all of them.
Just like I thought.
This is a circle for human transmutation, but the basis is a regular human.
What does that mean?
It just occurred to me.
It may be impossible to perform human transmutation on the dead,
but what about on a living person?
I mean, maybe I could perform human transmutation on myself.
It would still be human transmutation, so the gate would open.
So if you open the real Gate of Truth, we can get out of here?
What happens if you fail?
There would be a rebound.
Worst case scenario, we all die.
If we do nothing, we'll die anyway.
So hurry up and do it.
Here we go.
Now, Lin! Jump!
I'm trusting you.
Alchemist!
Good. Here it is.
Al!
Al!
Come on! Hurry!
No. You're not my soul.
I can't go with you.
Damn it!
Alphonse!
I'll come back for you someday.
Wait for me!
Brother!
Al! That means…
We made it back.
Brother! You're okay!
That hurts. Calm down.
I'm so glad you're alive.
I'm sorry.
I made you worry.
Limbs of steel,
and armor.
You must be the Elric brothers.
Hohenheim?!
Hohenheim?
Do you mean Van Hohenheim?
How do you know him?
He's our father.
What a surprise.
So he had children.
I see.
Listen.
Until the awaited day, take good care of your bodies.
What the hell are you? It's unbelievable.
There are a countless number of people inside you. Too many.
You must be the prince from Xing that Wrath told me about.
Gluttony, you may eat him.
Wait a minute! He's our friend.
He's of no use to me.
Gluttony.
I won't let you!
Our alchemy doesn't work!
Calm down, shorty.
Who is that bearded freak?!
You have spirit.
That's right.
I can't waste any human resources.
So that's what he's going to do.
What do you mean?
By submerging a Philosopher's Stone in a human's blood,
you can make a homunculus from a human.
Most die from the power of the stone, though.
The Philosopher's Stone!
As it turns out, we have an open spot for Greed.
Or should I say, my greed?
Turn him into a homunculus?
Stop! You monster!
He has someone waiting for him!
Don't move!
I came to this country to find the Philosopher's Stone.
He says he'll put one inside me. That's exactly what I want.
You want to become my greed?
How interesting.
Give me your body.
I, Greed, will make use of it.
Be my guest, greedy one.
I yield my body to you!
What a determined brat. Just don't regret it.
If I go home empty-handed,
how could I face my vassal who cut off her own arm to serve me?
You're insatiable. I like that.
Come on, Greed.
I accept you!
Lin.
This is a nice body.
Thank you for giving me life, Father.
Where's Lin?
He was a funny kid.
But I'm sorry to say that this body now belongs to Greed.
He can't be that easy to take over.
Lin! Answer me!
A guard.
How dare you hurt Alphonse… Prepare to be punished!
That won't work--
Why does your alchemy work here?
Yes.
It certainly does work.
Body Disrupting Attack.
Or rather, deconstruction.
A second longer and I would have been dust.
Scar!
May!
It's time to retreat.
Don't be so reckless.
A dust explosion. Those punks.
Greed is gone too.
My, my.
So rebirth hasn't cured his rebellious attitude.
I'm different from the other homunculi.
I was originally a human.
A Philosopher's Stone was put into my blood,
which changed me from a human into a homunculus.
So I became Wrath.
In other words, I was imbued with the emotion of fury.
If you were once human, can't you live as a human now?
Please don't misunderstand.
We homunculi are proud of our ability to transcend humanity.
Why are you letting me live?
You still have some use left.
I'm glad you're safe.
I was wrong in thinking that some of the top brass were corrupted.
Then Führer Bradley isn't…
No.
All of them. All of the top brass are corrupt.
Where the hell were you?!
I even called the military but no luck.
And you finally bother to call only after I left a message with Mustang.
I don't care if he is a colonel!
She's as crazy as ever.
What did she say?
She said to go and see Hohenheim.
Father?
She said he's probably in Reole
and we should ask him about the "Promised Day."
Promised Day?
I'm sure it's related to the awaited day the bearded guy mentioned.
Looks like it'll be finished soon.
You've dug an amazing tunnel.
I'm sorry, everyone.
I need to use you.
Is that the trump card you think will defeat that guy?
This is the research notebook my brother left me.
What's written in it?
A combination of Xing's Purification Arts and Amestris's alchemy.
What is it? What does it say?
The information is correct, but nothing new yet.
What could the Promised Day be?
Lin!
You still do nothing but eat.
I feel alive again.
But I'm glad you returned to yourself.
No. I'm still a homunculus.
But…
The guy who took over my body, Greed, is quite the rebellious child.
He rebelled against his father before, and was killed for it.
So you're still Greed?
I'd call it coexistence or maybe a tug of war.
I have my body back for now, but who knows when he'll take over again.
Really?
Before that happens, there's something I need to tell you.
We have a lot to ask you…
Lin?
Lin!
Don't give in to him!
On the awaited day, he will open the Gate.
You mean the Gate of Truth? What is he trying to do?!
Ed, you have to stop him.
Hey, Lin!
Damned prince of Xing. You talk way too much.
Greed?
Yes.
I have no desire to fight you.
Like this one said.
I cut ties with the other homunculi. I'm not your enemy.
Then tell me about the Promised Day.
I mean, the awaited day.
I can't tell you that. I'm not your ally, either.
Find the answer yourselves.
Later.
Are we going to just let him go?
He's still half Lin.
He's not so easy to take over.
These important papers got all mixed up.
Mixed up?
Hey!
It's strange how many words here mean gold or immortality.
So?
If I rearranged these and laid those words on top of each other, what would happen?
Here, I'll help you.
These designs seem to all be connected.
No way.
This is a Transmutation Circle for the Philosopher's Stone.
"Reole."
Hold on. This is a map?
"Cameron."
"Fisk."
"Pendleton."
This is Amestris.
The State Alchemists…
If you transmuted a Philosopher's Stone with a circle the size of the country,
how many people would be sacrificed?
Brother!
All of these points are places where coups or civil wars have happened.
Could the military be systematically carving crests of blood?
And to do that, they shed a lot of people's blood at each place.
You mean the war in Ishval was just a part of this plan?
They intentionally started a civil war…
to send the innocent people of Ishval
to their deaths?
They won't get away with this.
The military is involved in each crest of blood.
Lt. Col. Hughes must have figured this out.
That's why he was killed.
Damn it.
The first civil war happened when the country was founded,
so they've been planning this for over 300 years.
There's one place in the north without a crest of blood yet.
Briggs.
Al.
You find Hohenheim and ask him about the Promised Day.
And you?
I won't let them carve a crest of blood at Briggs.
I'm going north.
Edward went north. I gave him a letter of introduction.
The defender of the border with Drachma,
Major General Armstrong, who they call the Northern Wall of Briggs,
will be difficult to sway.
It seems that Alphonse is headed east.
To meet his father, he said.
His father?
My only clue is that he said he was going to Reole.
I wonder if I'll be able to find him.
They say the weather in the mountains changes often, but this is too much.
I'm totally lost.
Izumi said a part of her training was surviving for a month here in winter.
But that's impossible!
She said she killed a bear
that was over two meters tall.
A bear!
Wait!
That's a State Military uniform. You're a Briggs soldier?
Resistance is useless, Drachma spy!
I'm not a spy. I'm a State Alchemist, Edward Elric.
I'm here to see Maj. Gen. Armstrong, the commander of Briggs.
I have a letter of introduction from their brother, Major Armstrong.
Brother?
What is it, Buccaneer?
I'm sorry for the trouble, Maj. Gen. Armstrong.
Major General?
So the Major's sibling is actually his older sister?
They look nothing alike.
It's really from Alex.
This means nothing to me. I can form my own opinions.
Come in, Fullmetal Alchemist.
There must be something else.
All my brother's research couldn't be just a guess at their plans.
I've rearranged it hundreds of times, but there's nothing else there.
No.
Don't give up. There must be something more behind it.
Behind?
Scar, it must be behind!
Let's turn all of this over.
You were right. This might be what we need to stop them.
Your brother was a really talented man.
This fuses the wisdom of both countries to neutralize the Transmutation Circle.
A reverse nationwide Transmutation Circle.
So this is the impregnable fortress guarded by the fierce soldiers of Briggs.
Is my brother Alex well?
Yes! He's very well.
What is it?!
Intruder below!
What is that thing?
What a drag.
This is wide open.
Can I stop digging now?
A homunculus!
Fire!
The bullets don't hurt him?
Stop the alarm! Don't let Drachma know we're having trouble!
Remove the fuses!
Load in sequence!
Fire!
Give him all you've got!
We're out of ammunition!
Push him!
Keep going!
Push him off the cliff!
It's cold.
What a drag.
It's a composite fuel for cold weather.
Even in the cold, it evaporates instantly, taking all body heat with it.
You'll be there until spring, you lazy idiot.
What the hell?
That monster dug all this?
Why is Lt. General Raven here?
He just arrived from Central. He says it's urgent.
And he called for me? How did he know I was here?
It's been a long time, Major General Armstrong.
Winry! What are you doing here?
You came all this way because the Military called you?
They said you wanted the cold weather version of your automail.
I'm sorry, I didn't know it would be such an issue.
It's clearly a warning.
If I do anything they don't like, they'll hurt you.
You're a hostage.
A hostage? I'm holding you back.
That's not true. You're really not.
Without you, I couldn't do any alchemy anyway.
All you guys want is to return to your original bodies.
Why do you have to get dragged all over the place?
It's all right, Winry.
Don't worry.
That slob dug all this?
This is far enough.
No one will hear us down here.
I was just relieved from my duty as commander of Briggs.
What?
And
I was told to return that monster to this tunnel
I was told he's no threat, but a part of a secret military operation.
But I don't care if it's a lieutenant general or whoever else,
I will not give anyone free reign here!
Fullmetal Alchemist.
Tell me everything you know. Don't hold anything back.
Everything.
The Philosopher's Stone, homunculi, King Bradley, Father,
and the Promised Day.
It's all so hard to believe.
So, to stop them from carving a crest of blood via some kind of battle,
you came here to Briggs?
Then tell me, what is this tunnel?
I don't know for certain,
but an important factor of alchemy is using circles to conduct power.
I think this tunnel is a giant circle surrounding Amestris.
What is it?!
The Drachma army has launched simultaneous attacks!
What?
Why would Drachma attack now?
Raven must have done something.
Damn! He got the jump on us.
The Drachma army is very strong.
To win will mean heavy casualties on both sides.
They'll carve a crest of blood here too.
We have no way to stop it now.
Don't be glum.
Hit them with all we've got!
Yes, ma'am!
Commence artillery fire!
Ready? We'll hit them all at once!
Now's the time to show them the strength of Briggs!
Miles and the Briggs soldiers will see you safely to Resembool.
Don't worry about me.
Hey, Winry.
Take your grandma and Den and flee the country.
Why should we flee?
Aren't you going to stop whatever is happening?
I'm going to stop it.
But just in case…
There is no just in case! You have to stop them.
Save this country.
And you and Al have to come home in your real bodies.
I'll do whatever it takes too!
Okay.
I'll take care of the Promised Day, and then I'll come back to you.
Bake me an apple pie and wait for me.
What did you hear from the Fullmetal Alchemist?
About the origins of this country, and the homunculi.
And about your true identity, sir.
You still answered my summons after hearing all that?
I have no small interest in immortality myself.
Excellency, give me that idiot's…
I mean, give me Lt. General Raven's position.
How funny.
All right. It's yours.
In exchange,
I want the Briggs soldiers.
As you wish.
I trained them carefully. They are strong soldiers.
I am sure they will please you, sir.
Brings back memories.
But I need to find Father right away.
Shopkeep. How's this?
Hohenheim, you can take a rest now.
After you took me in and cared for me, it's the least I can do.
That armor is from my collection!
It's me. Didn't Pinako tell you?
Alphonse?
So you met him?
He looked just like you.
You guys are going to try to prevent the Promised Day?
I see.
So this is also our fate.
Alphonse, since it's come to this,
I'll tell you everything.
Hey… You.
Over here.
Here. Behind you!
What…
are you?
You gave your blood for an experiment.
I was born from that blood.
Huh.
I'm Slave Number 23.
You don't have a name?
Then let me give you one as thanks.
Let's see.
How about Van Hohenheim?
Van Hohenheim…
It's spelled… Wait, can you read and write?
I can work without knowing how to do those things.
But then things are always going to be the same for you.
Freedom and rights.
Don't you want those?
I will give you knowledge.
Then you will be able to free yourself from slavery.
Hohenheim.
What should I call you?
You can call me the dwarf in the flask.
You've come a long way from the slave that you were.
And you grew a beard.
You look splendid, Hohenheim.
Quiet.
Immortality?
Why does every man want that as soon as they get a taste of power?
We're in front of the King.
It's fine!
Enough chit-chat.
Can you give me immortality or not?
I can.
I'll teach you the secret to immortality.
Amazing.
The King is going to become immortal.
This is the moment of the century!
What is…?
What? What's happening?
What have you done?!
Now, you and I…
are the center of everything.
Everyone is dead.
What is this?
Somebody…
Somebody answer me.
Impossible. They've been drained of their souls.
The King! You're safe--
I used the information in your blood to create a vessel for myself.
You…
The dwarf in the flask?
You gave me your blood, so I gave you a name and knowledge.
And now, I gave you a body that will never die
in exchange for every human soul in this country.
What have you done?
Well, half of the souls went to me.
Thank you for your cooperation…
Hohenheim.
May, it's me.
Where's Alphonse?
He's not back yet? Where's Scar?
He finally found the real meaning behind his brother's research.
A reverse nationwide Transmutation Circle! Scar went to prepare it.
A reverse nationwide Transmutation Circle?
Yo.
Lin!
I'm Greed.
You still don't trust me.
Of course not. You're a homunculus.
Even though I'm helping you patrol?
Give Lin back control of his body.
I can't do that.
I really like this body.
He's going to kick you out of there someday.
Al!
You made it!
What is it?
Is something wrong?
Ed! Get away from him.
That was close!
Greed, are you on their side?
Your soul is too weak.
You know him?
This is Pride.
He's my oldest brother, but even I think he's a monster.
You again?
I'm glad to see you're all right!
I was waiting for you, Ranfun!
Ed, let's leave this to Ranfun and find Pride's vessel.
Vessel?
His main body must be hiding in the shadows of the forest.
You had me fooled, Selim.
I never thought a little kid like you would be a homunculus.
Appearances are merely symbols,
little alchemist.
Foo!
His shadows vanish when they're separated from his body.
You talk too much. What a useless little brother.
Oh? He's nearby.
Hohenheim.
You've been giving my sons a lot of trouble, haven't you?
You're finally here.
The hero always arrives late.
Hero? You think you can defeat me?
No, I won't.
You're too scary.
Distracting me so you can attack from behind?
What a lame strategy.
He went out of his way to be a hostage. Your son is a weirdo too.
Don't mock my son.
That was fast!
Complete darkness?
Now you can't use your powers.
But you can't leave here, either.
So we'll see who has more patience.
I suppose…
we'll stay here until the Promised Day has passed.
Damn.
You dragged Al into this?!
This was Al's idea.
This is how he thinks he can keep us all alive.
Al.
My preparations are complete.
The reverse nationwide Transmutation Circle?
There are multiple routes to the central area underground.
We should split up.
Now, while Alphonse has the most troublesome minion locked up,
we'll take out the big boss.
Damn it! Don't order everyone around!
Al!
After we deal with that bearded freak underground, I'll come right back.
There will be a solar eclipse soon.
Where are the Briggs soldiers?
Due to the train accident yesterday, they haven't arrived yet.
Mustang is leading a coup.
Is that true?
I'm going back to Central.
You're late, Colonel.
We were about to leave without you.
You weren't followed?
If we were, this guy would have let us know.
You sure are helpful.
He deserves a rank.
I can't believe Mustang would do this.
Success. The Führer has been blown up!
Colonel, your orders?
All we have now is a one-way ticket to the battlefield.
So I have only one order for you.
Stay alive. That is all.
Yes, sir!
What? Mustang?!
A coup?!
We don't even know if the Führer is safe or not!
The Briggs soldiers are on their way to Central Headquarters!
Aren't the Briggs soldiers supposed to be training in the east?
What's going on, Armstrong?!
They are no longer under my command.
You.
You know something.
A new world is dawning.
And we will become immortal.
We are the chosen elite.
You dare defy us?
There's no hope for any of you.
You're a traitor now, Armstrong?!
I wonder.
When everything is over, perhaps I'll be a hero.
You again?
Come at me, you lazy slob!
Central Headquarters is now under the control of Major General Armstrong.
We're going to crush the Central Army!
Are you all right, Sister?
Who do you think you're talking to, Alex?
What a drag.
What a drag to have to fight for real.
What is that speed?
I'm the fastest homunculus.
You really are just a kid.
Or is that some kind of signal?!
Pride, I found you.
I got tired of waiting for you.
I'm tired. I need to replenish my energy.
Pride, no!
What is this place?
There's a Philosopher's Stone Transmutation Circle here too.
What are these people?!
You guys again?
They just keep coming!
Need a hand, Fullmetal?
You always butt in at just the right moment.
Their weak spot is the head!
What do you think, Scar?
The Colonel is a State Alchemist who fought in Ishval.
You're still alive?
That's right.
I'm the one you hate, the one who killed Hughes.
I like that expression!
If we don't hate each other like humans, it's no fun at all.
There's no need to say any more, Envy.
First I'll burn that tongue off at the root.
Then the eyes!
You'll die in endless pain.
Human scum! Who are you looking down on?!
Is that your true form?
How pitiful.
No, stop! Help!
I'll burn you, slowly.
What are you doing, Lieutenant?
That's enough, Colonel. I'll take care of the rest.
I just need to burn him once more.
-Lower your gun. -I can't!
Stop screwing around! I said lower it!
Fullmetal.
Give it to me.
No.
Give it to me, Fullmetal!
Or I'll burn your hand along with it.
Fine by me! Let's fight!
But first, look at your face!
You plan to lead this country looking like that?
Is this who you want to be?!
I have no right to stop another man's revenge.
But when a man acts like a beast
and wears human skin, what kind of world will he create?
We shall see.
I won't let you kill it!
But this thing killed Hughes.
What you're doing now…
is not for the sake of the country, or to help your comrades.
You're consumed by the desire for revenge.
I can't let you stoop so low.
What is going on here?
My soldiers are angry with me,
and the man who hunted me as an enemy admonished me.
I made you do this.
I'm…
a complete fool.
Put down your gun, Lieutenant.
I'm sorry.
Idiot. What drivel!
Why?! Damn it!
You're jealous of people.
When we get hit, when we're humbled, when we lose our way,
we stand up and try again and again.
Those around us help us to stand.
That's what you envy about people.
You humans make me hate myself.
How incredibly humiliating!
It killed itself?
Coward.
You came alone?
Slave Number 23.
You've become so boring.
You used to be more emotional and funny.
Right, dwarf in the flask?
Lust, greed, sloth,
gluttony, envy, wrath, pride.
You purged yourself of those seven emotions via the homunculi
and became even less human.
I have no desire to be human.
I wish to be perfect.
I will take the 500,000 souls in you for the Philosopher's Stone.
Your expression finally changed.
What did you do?
The souls that just entered your body
are working with me.
That's ridiculous. They're just particles of energy.
You think it's impossible?
I have already finished
speaking with the 536,329 souls of the citizens of Xerxes
who were inside me.
With all of our strength together,
we will destroy that vessel.
Feel the pain of those you looked down on.
Is it not you who despised them?
Hohenheim.
Don't think that you are the only one to make any progress!
Where was it?
I need to find the underground entrance quickly.
Sister, hurry.
I'm here to help.
Am I dying?
Oh, well.
Living is such a drag.
Are you Izumi Curtis?
Did Ed tell you about me?
You were the one who toyed with my Briggs soldiers for a month.
Sister, it's Captain Buccaneer.
What is it?
We've taken 90% of Central Headquarters.
Victory is ours!
Nice work, Buccaneer.
I'm back, gentlemen!
He's still alive.
King Bradley!
Where is he?
In front of you.
What is this?!
To enter my own castle,
is there any reason I should go through the back door?
Greed, if you stand in my way, I'll show no mercy.
I'm greedy.
I want your life too!
Nice work, old man.
You're Greed now.
You give off a sickening aura from my prince's body.
Is this the man who shredded my granddaughter's arm?
Selim!
You human sacrifices
are finally going to make yourselves useful.
Fullmetal!
Foo!
The Xing Prince?
Once again,
you put your life at risk for something you should throw away.
Someone that soft can never become King.
My prince, I'm an old man so just leave me.
That's not what I want to become.
A man unworthy to be king?
He must be defeated.
Harden up, Greed.
Protect the prince's body!
Become King.
Let this old man
go to his eternal rest!
You fool!
Even when one has the eyes of a god,
you can't avoid a hidden attack.
Old man, I'll go with you to hell.
I'm grateful.
Grandfather!
Let me go!
It's my duty to protect you, my prince.
Don't be stupid! Help your grandfather!
It's already too late.
Teacher!
What the hell is going on here?
Al!
There's still someone missing.
Hohenheim?!
Father!
I'm sorry to let you see me like this.
What is this black thing?
The one the homunculi call Father.
That bearded freak?!
Welcome, my sacrifices!
There's no time left.
Colonel, will you please perform human transmutation and open the Gate?
What?
We're short one sacrifice. It doesn't matter who you transmute.
Your late parents, a lover, a friend.
I refuse.
Colonel!
It doesn't matter if you don't want to do it.
We will make you open the Gate.
I've got him secured. Get out of the way, Wrath.
Now, what part of you will be taken?
Let's start the human transmutation, Colonel Mustang.
Colonel!
All five of them are here.
Are you all right?
Fullmetal, where are we?
We're in the boss's place. What happened?
I was thrown in front of a huge gate in a white void.
You opened the Gate?!
What did it take? A limb?
What's going on? It's so dark, I can't see anything.
What are you saying?
I can't…
see.
Truth is cruel.
One who seeks the warmth of his dead mother loses his limbs,
The other cannot feel warmth at all.
She who seeks her lost child can never have another baby.
And the one who looks ahead to his country's future
loses the ability to see anything.
To keep humanity from becoming arrogant,
you are given righteous despair.
That is the existence of what you humans call God.
It is Truth.
Scar, this is the center. They're below this.
I feel the souls of many people.
Alphonse!
Colonel!
I won't let you get in Father's way!
Now you can't use your right hand.
You forgot about my left.
This is a new Transmutation Circle
that I took from my brother's research notebook.
The time has come!
Have any of you
ever thought of the Earth as one living body?
A living body to record the information of the vastness of space.
If you open that Gate,
just how powerful could you become?
With you as the sacrifices,
here and now,
I will open that Gate!
It's happening!
Winry!
When Hohenheim comes back,
I'm going to punch him.
God!
Answer my soul!
Come!
I will drag you down to Earth,
and make you a part of me!
What happened?
It's awfully quiet.
It can't be.
They've all been used to make a Philosopher's Stone?
That's right.
Except for this central area.
Damn. He succeeded.
I appreciate your cooperation.
My human sacrifices.
Everyone, get beside me.
Hurry!
Goodbye, everyone.
None of you leave my side!
Oh.
A Philosopher's Stone with 500,000 souls made you fairly strong.
But next time, it will not be enough.
That's…
Now that God is mine,
I can even create a sun in my hand.
Be gone, alchemists!
Did you notice it?
That heartbeat that's been echoing here for some time?
The souls of the people of this country
are still attached to their bodies by way of their spirits.
What have you done, Hohenheim?
Over many months and years,
after endless calculations,
in anticipation of this day,
I placed Philosopher's Stones,
who are my comrades, in every corner of this land.
For what purpose?
You can't transmute without a circle.
I have a circle.
An extraordinarily large and powerful one that will come down from the sky.
The shadow of the moon that falls on the Earth during an eclipse.
The umbra!
Are you going to get in my way, Hohenheim?!
That's why I'm here,
Dwarf in the flask!
You okay?
Winry,
are you all right?
Father!
Now all the souls should have returned to their rightful owners.
I will not allow the tragedy of Xerxes to be repeated.
He still has this much energy left?
I can't push it back!
Hang on, Father!
You big jerk! Don't you dare let up!
This is a tough spot.
It makes me want to show you what I can do.
Aren't you ready yet, Scar?!
Heaven has sent me a sophisticated opponent.
Revenge for your grandfather?
That is as it should be.
Any last words?
No!
I lived my life as it was prescribed to me.
But thanks to you humans…
Well…
The last part of my life…
was challenging…
and worth living.
This is the center.
Big Brother.
It's here!
Your seal against alchemy doesn't work anymore!
Serves you right.
This is the power of what Scar's brother created,
the reverse nationwide Transmutation Circle!
Well?
You must have your hands full just trying to keep God in that body.
He's going to try to make another Philosopher's Stone!
Brother!
Go on!
I'll take care of this guy.
Let's go, Al. We have to stop him.
Don't you dare lose, Ed!
I won't!
Let me absorb you!
Okay, here I come!
You turned yourself into a Philosopher's Stone to invade me?!
I've got you now, Pride!
Get out of me!
So this is your true form?
Colonel!
Colonel, are you all right?!
My eyes are damaged.
Can you still fight?
Yes!
Wait there, stupid Selim.
Stop resisting.
Not yet.
There's no shortage of resources!
Scum!
That's not good!
Alphonse, you did this to save me?
He's nearing the end of his strength.
We have to keep chipping away at the strength of stone.
Did I hit him?
You just missed. Five degrees to the right!
Keep it up!
Run.
Get away.
May, I need to ask a favor.
My brother sacrificed his right arm to pull me out of that place.
So the opposite should be possible. The law of equivalent exchange.
Alphonse, what are you thinking?
All you have to do is make a path.
But if I do that, you'll…
Philosopher's Stone.
May, please.
Run away!
Edward!
What are you doing, Al?
Defeat him, Brother.
No!
Stop!
Is it time?
Yes. Now I just need to trust my brother.
Hey.
You're back inside yourself.
Will he come back for you?
Absolutely.
I'm looking forward to seeing what he will sacrifice.
Idiot!
It's working.
It's going to work.
Edward!
Go, Ed!
Edward!
Edward!
Go!
Fullmetal!
Get up, you pathetic slob!
I'll show you just how different we are!
Why?
I have God inside me, but a human's bare hand hurt me.
Father, I will take God!
Give me the stone.
No!
Hang in there, Greed!
I wanted everything in this world.
But maybe what I really wanted was comrades like you.
You are our comrade!
Prince of Xing, become a great ruler.
So long.
Greed!
Ranfun! Now!
Greed, why do you disobey me?
I'm just having a late teenage rebellious phase, Father.
Greed!
Insolence! Now you will die, Greed!
Now, Ed!
Go back to where you came from,
Dwarf in the flask!
No! I don't want to go back!
I don't want to be trapped there anymore.
No!
Despair for the arrogant. This is the end you asked for.
What's happening? Did we win?
Yes.
But Alphonse hasn't come back from that place yet.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault. It was Al's decision.
Edward.
Use my life…
to bring Alphonse back.
I have one soul left inside me.
Don't be stupid. You know I can't do that!
And besides
I promised Al we'd never use a human life to restore our bodies.
Edward!
Your bodies
ended up like this
because of me.
I'm so sorry.
At the end of my life…
let me be a father for once.
Don't say stupid stuff, Dad!
Never say that again! I'll knock you out!
Finally…
you called me "Dad."
No one ever told the two of us…
to give up.
A human Transmutation Circle…
I gotta go.
The Fullmetal alchemist is going to perform his last transmutation!
Did you come here to take your brother back?
But at what price?
Would you give me your body?
The price is this.
A big one.
There is a Gate of Truth within every person.
That means that all people have the power to use alchemy.
Will you go back to being a normal person who can't use alchemy?
I've always been a normal person.
All is one, one is all.
Even without alchemy, I still have all of them.
My friends and comrades.
Correct, Alchemist.
You've beaten me.
Take him. All of him.
What a reckless thing to do.
I've come for you.
Let's go home.
Everyone's waiting.
Al!
Alphonse!
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I made you do something difficult.
Hey.
Father.
Welcome back.
I'm here.
You're warm.
Al, you did wonderfully.
Don't cry, Major.
You're a greater man than your older brother.
What? No way, Lin.
Major, you're crying too much.
You're now in the custody of Major General Armstrong.
I'm allowed to live again?
Come back to Ishval with me, and we'll work to restore it.
Half of the blood in my veins is Ishvalan.
Your hands will save our people from death.
You mean there's a reason I was kept alive?
Big Brother.
The Yao family will be the next on the throne.
But don't worry.
The Yao family will protect yours.
I will accept the Chang family and all the other families.
Now let's go
back to our country!
Here you are.
My eyes
can no longer see the future I once envisioned.
But Colonel, you swore
that you would become the foundation of the country and protect its people.
I know we'll find a way to restore your sight.
Until then, I will be your eyes.
Now let's go…
and step out into the sunshine.
Hohenheim?
You old fool.
What a happy expression you have in death.
Hey.
You're here already?
Is everything all right?
Yes.
We've done our part.
Now the world will raise our children to be strong.
I'm home.
We're home.
Welcome back.
Oil it every day, and check for loose screws.
Are you listening?
Yep.
Ugh!
You could have gotten your leg back, couldn't you?
Yes.
But this is a reminder to myself.
I'm excited to see what there is out west.
Huh?
Nothing. It's just that no matter how old you get, you can't stay put.
But don't be reckless.
You can't use alchemy anymore.
I know that.
Well, then.
Okay.
Well, I…
What? Just say it?
An equivalent exchange!
I'll give you half of my life, so you give me half of yours!
That's so stupid!
What?
Why do alchemists always talk about equivalent exchange?
It's just so stupid.
I'll give you all of it. Not half.
What?
No, I'm sorry.
You're really something, you know that?
You can even overturn the law of equivalent exchange.
Don't make fun of me.
Wait for me, Winry.
