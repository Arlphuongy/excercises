Thao!
Do you remember me?
Nhu Quynh?
You're my biggest idol.
Biggest idol?
Sure. Posting your sex pictures online for all to see!
You're the kind of person who would destroy her friends
just to get what she wants.
Aren't you?
Uh…
…But in the end…
…Everyone still loves me…
…Right?
That's right! Amazing!
Thao Nara is truly a star whom we all love,
isn't that right?
I know.

Will the tragic death of Pham Thi Mai Thao
remind us of what happened to Le Thi Huynh Anh one year ago?
Phong! When did you get here?
Does Nhu know you're here?
She's upstairs.
My goodness, why didn't you go inside?
You poor thing. You know, our home is your home.
Come inside!
Hey Phong, where's your new bike?
New bike?
The one you posted on Facebook.
Hey, is that it over there?
Hey Phong, can we go for a ride?
Come inside Bao.
Phong and Nhu have somewhere to go.
Next time, okay?
Pinky shake.
Mommy! Phong promised to take me on his new bike.
Stop playing around. Take a bath now.
You scared me.
I'll wait for you downstairs.
Ever since she was young, all Thao wanted was to be famous.
Now, all that's over.
Someone once said that before we die
our whole life flashes before our eyes.
Like the most perfect, most beautiful dream…
In it, we have everything we ever wanted in life.
And we'll want to live in that dream forever.
I bet that's where Thao is now.
But every dream has to an end, Phong.
Sooner or later, we all have to wake up.
Look at you! Why'd you tie this so tight?
We should go.
I want to get there a little early.
Sad huh? Gone too soon for such a hot piece of ass.
Hold on a second.
New girlfriend?
Nah. Just added her on Facebook.
Ooh, you're killing me, you perverted little thing!
Hey Phong, I still don't get it.
Nhu is your girlfriend.
Why aren't you guys friends on Facebook?
How could I? I don't have Facebook.
I've seen your Facebook page!
Then you should go check your eyes!
A few days before Thao died,
I saw she had added a sicko on Facebook.
How do you know?
Because I follow him on Facebook.
What for?
His Facebook has pictures that I, uh…
…like to collect.
Punk ass! Sex pics again?
Here, let me show you this freak's Facebook picture.
Gives me the heebie-jeebies.
You guys know anyone who goes by 'Dream Man' on Facebook?
Damn it! Why no signal?
Your phone's just tired bro. Bogged down by porn.
Seems you and this 'Dream Man' have a lot in common.
You should add him on Facebook,
you pornholio!
Your driving scares me!
You sure that's really your bike?
What's wrong? Tired?
Get some rest. I'm gonna go inside, ok?
This afternoon, at the funeral,
what were you and Cuong talking about?
Just friends consoling each other.
Why? Are you jealous?
I'm just a bumpkin.
How could I be jealous?
But I gave you that photo.
Do you still have it?
Wow, you really kept your word!
My dad took this with his Polaroid back in the day,
so it really is one-of-a-kind.
They didn't have selfies or 360° back then…
That's why this one is special.
Here you are.
It's yours and yours alone, got that?
In love, we give our hearts to each other, right?
Oh god, so cheesy!
Cheesy but sincere, okay?
Piece of crap!
Damn!
My brutha, my brutha…
Look at all them melons, bro!
Whoa…
That's the girl who messaged me today.
Thuy Trinh…
Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Thang?
Uh, yeah. Who's this?
It's me. Trinh.
Trinh?
Uh… how did you get this number?
You just friended 'Dream Man'.
Yeah, but… Uh, what's up?
I'm just feeling so… so sad.
Can you come over here with me?
Uh… where are you at?
I'm at the motel on Su Van Hanh.
The one you mentioned on Facebook.
Uh… I did?
Uh… ok, sure. I'll be there.
Excuse me. Have you seen the guard anywhere?
Excuse me. Can you open the door? I need to go home.
We'll pause right there, and hit it when I get back.
Where's that guy who was just here?
What are you talking about?
Haven't seen anyone all night.
You're making plans to see other girls, aren't you?
Ah… no, I'm not.
What's so funny?
You. You're lying.
No. I told you already.
From now on, there's only you.
Really?
Of course!
Do you swear?
I swear.
Then kiss me.
Hey, you've posted pictures of other girls on Facebook
but none of me.
Are you ashamed to show me off?
You really want me to post your picture on Facebook?
Smile, ok?
Hello?
Son! My son!
Don't take my son!
At least let me put some pants on him!
Let me put some pants on him! Don't take my son!
Son! My son!
Taking him all naked like that!
Did Thang go anywhere before you found him?
No. He was with you guys, then came home…
and didn't leave his room.
He didn't go anywhere!
Dammit. It's blocked.
Check your friend list again.
See if there's anyone named 'Dream Man'.
There isn't. I don't have many Facebook friends.
How about you?
I don't have Facebook.
What is wrong with you?
Goddammit!
I'm okay.
Auntie, I'm going home…
Are you okay, Phong?
I don't know why…
…somehow I feel like this is all my fault.
You're thinking too much.
We're all just really stressed out.
Why are you home so late?
I, uh…
Next time you go off like that, let me know, okay?
So if anything happens, I'll know where you are.
Is something wrong?
No, nothing Mom…
I feel so sorry for Thao.
So who went there today?
Was Cuong there?
For some reason, I really love that kid.
What are you making mom?
I couldn't sleep… …so I heated up some 'bánh ít'…
…for you to bring to school tomorrow …and share with your friends.
Mom, no one does that here.
But you love my 'bánh ít.'
Now who would call at this hour?
Hello?
Here, eat one.
I just took Nhu home a little while ago…
Yes, just now.
Did something happen to Nhu?
Yes, ok… ok… I know…
I… I'll be right over.
-What wrong? -Mom, I have to go.
She left without saying a word.
Where would she go without taking her phone?
Hey, Phong!
I told you to go to bed.
-Is sis back yet? -Not yet.
NHU: You guys know I don't use Facebook.
Hello? What's up man?
Hello?
Hello?
I know where to find 'Dream Man.'
What? Where?
Hey, hey, hey! What's wrong with you?
Get down. I'm driving.
So… where are we going?
Well, the 'Location' on Facebook was somewhere around…
Are you kidding me?
How are we going to find the right house in this mess?
There he is!
Where'd you go?
We have looked for you everywhere.
He says two people used to live here
but they left the city.
Gone all the way back to their hometown.
But what do you boys want with them anyway?
Ms. Lan and her son, Vu
holed up in here the whole time.
No one ever saw them.
Do you know where they came from?
Of course I know!
They came from…
Now where was it again?
-Binh Phuoc. -What?
-They came from Binh Phuoc. -How do you know?
No, not Binh Phuoc.
Now, where was it again?
Anyway, listen…
That Vu was one strange kid.
Would lock himself all day in that room. Never letting anyone in.
When they left
we had to bring in a Buddhist master
to drive away the evil spirits.
The charms are still untouched. See?
So much dark energy in that room.
Who'd ever want to go in?
Um, okay… we'd better get going.
Thanks for your help.
When you couldn't find me earlier…
…I was in Vu's room.
That neighbor's room of magical charms?
Here. I found this.
The Binh Phuoc Newspaper?
"After the death of Le Thi Huynh Anh last November…"
Why would Vu keep something like this?
Huynh Anh was his first victim.
But look at the photo.
That's pretty sick. Who would paste Nhu's picture here?
There's only one copy of that photo And it belongs to me.
Now do you see why we need to go?
Come on, dude…
Nhu is always pulling these tricks.
What's she thinking trying to get us to go to Binh Phuoc?
If you don't want to go, then I'll go alone.
You're really gonna look for that woman and her son?
Binh Phuoc's really far.
The highway will be crawling with cops.
-Check please! -That'll be 30,000.
Thank you.
Binh Phuoc's really far, man.
Take care driving out there.
You won't find them.
Hurry up, I've gotta go.
Move over. I'm driving.
What are you looking at?
With you driving to Binh Phuoc, we'd both die for sure.
Wait here.
Excuse me, sir.
Do you know where Ms. Lan's house is?
Excuse me, can you tell me where Ms. Lan's house is?
Ms. Lan and Vu…?
You shouldn't go there. It's a bad place.
Thanks.
Nhu!
Hey!
Lan and Vu's house is over there. Get on.
Is there anyone home?
Is anyone home?
Phong, Look.
Why is his face scratched out in all the photos?
Here too.
I'll give you one guess as to which one is Vu.
"Mai Tuan Vu"
Child…
Ma'am, we'd like to see your son.
Is he home?
Ma'am, you're Ms. Lan, right?
Is Vu home?
Vu?
Are you his friends?
Uh… yes. We know Vu online.
Oh, that's right.
My son has a lot of friends online.
People here don't understand him
but online, he has a lot of admirers.
I even saw a picture of his girlfriend online…
Pretty…
So pretty…
Is Hyunh Anh, Vu's girlfriend?
No! Huynh Anh is the ex.
What was the new girl's name again?
Oh, I remember!
The new girl's name is…
…Nhu!
Where is Vu?
You know the answer to that.
But he'll only meet real friends.
Are you his real friend?
No! This one stays here.
He's not a real friend.
You go on alone.
You're the 'Dream Man'?
What have you done to my girlfriend?
I don't know what you're talking about!
I want to know what you've done to Nhu.
Huynh Anh?
HE's taken Nhu?
What will HE do to her?
What do I have to do to save Nhu?
What do I have to do to save Nhu!
Tell me!
It's done. What now?
I don't understand.
You…!
What have you done to Nhu? You bastard!
What have you done to my girlfriend?
I'm so humiliated.
My parent's reputation… My family's…
All of it ruined.
Pham Thi Mai Thao is the latest victim of 'Phong Do Mo Mong',
the anonymous Facebook user who, one year ago,
posted sensitive photos of Le Thi Huynh Anh on social media
leading Huynh Anh to tragically end her life.
I don't know why he's doing this to me.
What did I ever do to him?
Time to go!
You'll be late again!
Did you hear what I said?
Why do you always lock the door?
Vu! I told you not to go online again, didn't I?
Do you hear me? Vu!
Vu! Are you deaf?
Are you deaf, Vu?
Vu!
Have you seen my bike?
No, the 600.
600? What are you, dreaming kid?
Dammit! 'Phong Do Mo Mong' just posted pictures of Thao again.
Just this morning.
-And they still don't know who he is? -Nope.
How are you doing?
Doesn't matter. There's nothing we can do.
It'll be okay. Try not to think about it too much.
What are you laughing at?
Uh… sorry.
It's just that my friend here has something to say to Nhu.
Uh… I wrote a new poem…
Read it when you get a chance, okay?
Um… thank you.
Uh… what else? That's all. Come on, let's go.
Bye Nhu. We'll be leaving now.
There's another admirer.
Stop making fun of me, dork. Shall we go in?
And then I invited her to… UHH!
One shot. And it was on!
Gross!
This is how she liked it.
Come on, how about a smile?
-Cuong -What?
Look.
Huh?
Oh no, what now?
His mom's here.
It's okay. They're fine.
Here.
My mom brought you guys some 'banh ít.'
Awesome!
Cuong's Mom's 'bánh ít' are the best!
…you know, people like 'Phong Do Mo Mong' are delusional…
Remember when he actually believed Le Thi Huynh Anh was in love with him?
Remember when he actually believed Le Thi Huynh Anh was in love with him? I do remember.
They'd only known each other online, right?
Didn't Huynh Anh have a boyfriend at the time?
'Phong Do Mo Mong' posted those pictures
in an attempt to break them up.
But why is he posting your pictures now?
To tell you the truth…
I don't understand it either.
It's been a really tough month for me.
I went online today…
and he'd posted more pictures of me.
These past few days…
Oh, you poor thing!
It's often said
we should be grateful for our hardships and difficulties
because they help us become stronger, more confident.
That's why today I'd like to thank 'Phong Do Mo Mong'
for making me a stronger, more confident person.
And thanks to him, I get to be on your show, right?
You are so courageous!
Even without 'Phong Do Mo Mong,
it's an honor to have you on our show today.
Thank you.
Now, you want to be a model, isn't that right?
Actually, I'm a model, an actress, a singer
as well as an MC.
Oh, that's right. My apologies.
As a token of our appreciation,
"Fresh New Faces" has a very special gift for you:
That would be, an epic photoshoot
with a world famous photographer.
And you will appear in the upcoming issue of Vogue.
-What do you say? -Oh, thank you!
Our photos are beautiful. We have to own them.
We can't let just anyone do what they want with them.
Isn't that right, everyone?
SORRY U ALWAYS HAVE 2 B THE BAD GUY
Someone's here for you again.
You hear me?
I know what you're doing when you lock the door.
What do you want?
Nhu wants you to post another batch of photos.
Again? I'm chatting with her right now. She didn't said anything.
She's probably shy. You know… women.
The cops are looking for me. It's dangerous to post anything right now.
This'll be the last time.
You can ask Nhu yourself if you don't believe me.
I stopped doing this a long time ago.
I'm only doing it now because of Nhu.
Post them up as soon as you can, huh?
Who is that? Why does he keep coming to see you?
He's my friend.
You don't have friends. A real friend, or someone online?
-What do you mean by that? -What do I mean?
Why did I have to leave my home to come to this place where I don't know anyone.
Whose fault is that? Vu!
Go ahead, go back online.
I thought coming here you'd be different.
But you haven't changed one bit.
Always locking yourself in that room.
Vu!
Sure, go ahead and kill someone else!
You goddamn wretch!
I thought if we came here you'd have friends, that you'd be like a normal kid.
Vu!
Whoa!
After today's episode of "Fresh New Faces"
the 'Likes' were burning up Facebook, huh?
Maybe I should post my own hot photos.
See who's hotter.
Who'd want to see your pictures?
Hey! Not true. I've got some angles that are pretty damn hot.
Right, Thang?
Stupid.
Thao knows I'm just joking, right?
But seriously, you know who I think 'Phong Do Mo Mong' is?
You guys know Vu, that weirdo kid from school?
If you don't like him, just say so.
It's not that.
Remember the bike he posted on his Facebook?
After that, I noticed him constantly staring at my bike.
Everyone stares at your bike, not just him.
Just saying, if I were the police, I'd investigate him immediately.
Good thing you're not the police then, huh?
Why are you always defending him?
Because he likes her.
Of course she has to stand up for him.
I don't need everyone to like me. Unlike some people.
You might not know it, but… a lot of guys are nice in person.
On Facebook, they're monsters.
That's why I hate Facebook.
Hate it all you want. No one's forcing you to like it.
You're way too good for Facebook anyway.
Alright, so what is it? Are you upset about Vu, or about the photo?
That photo didn’t mean anything to you, did it?
My dad took that picture. It's the only one there is.
That’s why when I let you have it. It meant something.
I'm cheesy like that.
I told you, I didn't lose it.
I'll find it, okay?
I guess I’m as obsessed with photos as everyone else.
It's just a picture, right?
Sure. It's just a picture.
You'd better watch out. Soon you'll be posting clips like:
'I'm gonna be on this show!' Or 'Look how sad I am in this photo!' Or…
'Look at my poop from this morning!'
Who knows? Maybe Nhu Quynh will even invite you onto her show.
You follow Thao's Facebook pretty closely, huh?
No. Thang shows me all that stuff.
He put some kind of hidden app on Thao's phone.
It secretly records all of her Facebook posts.
That's how I know.
A secret app that records Thao's posts?
That's disgusting!
He's just looking. No harm done.
And yet you freak out when Vu just glances at your bike.
Hey, Vu's not just checking out my bike.
But my girlfriend also. That's the problem!
I didn't know you were so possessive.
Of course. When your girlfriend is that cheesy,
you have no choice but to be cheesy yourself.
That line was super cheesy.
Alright, that's about all the cheese I can stand.
You go inside. I'm gonna go home.
SORRY I DIDNT TELL U EARLIER
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Vu?
It's me.
It's Nhu.
Why aren't you saying anything?
Uh… you don't have a camera?
My camera's broken. I need to get it fixed.
Isn't this good enough for you?
No. It is.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier
that I needed you to post another batch of photos.
I didn't think it'd be such a big deal.
It's not a big deal. It's just that…
It's just what?
Well, I know we have to keep 'us' a secret.
But sometimes it seems like…
…you and Cuong still have feelings for each other.
Are you jealous?
I've told you already.
It's complicated between Cuong and me.
But things aren't what they seem on the outside.
Then how do I know that you're true to me?
Um… Do you still have that picture I gave you?
It never leaves my side.
Then why do you have to ask if I'm true to you?
What do you mean?
That picture was taken with a Polaroid.
There's only one of its kind in the world.
You couldn't make a copy.
And I put it in a heart-shaped locket so you'll know
that my heart belongs to you alone…
What are you doing?
Uh… nothing.
Do you believe me now?
I believe you.
Just so you know… In love,
we give our true hearts to one another, right?
That's right.
Okay, I'm going to bed now.
Sleep well. Kisses.
Kisses.
Vu!
Vu! I want to talk to you.
Did you hear what I just said?
You have something that's mine, you know that?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What did you post on Facebook last night? You did post something, didn't you?
I really don't know what you're talking about.
I think you do know. I don't care what you do on Facebook.
But you can't take people's stuff like that, got it?
Get out of my way.
Other people might not know who you are.
But I do… …'Phong Do Mo Mong'.
Now give me that photo or I'll…
Dammit!
That's mine! You liar!
Goddammit!
Don't make me do this Vu. Give it back!
Give it to me!
Let go!
Bastard! Take my stuff, huh?
I'll fucking kill you! Son of a bitch!
Stop it! That's enough!
That picture is mine!
-Leave it. Stop fighting. -But he took that picture.
I'll give you another one. Leave it.
-But it was mine and he took it! -No. I'll give you another one.
Any idea how Vu could have gotten that locket I gave to Cuong?
It's your stuff. Why are you asking me?
Are you using him?
What are you talking about?
You're using Vu, aren't you?
That loser?
For what?
I think he'd be useful to someone like you.
What do you mean 'someone like me'?
Someone willing to do anything to become famous.
Since when do you have the right to judge me, Nhu?
Since I saw my picture getting mixed up in your schemes.
How about me getting mixed up with you my entire life? How about that?
Always having to be your sidekick…
The one who's not as pretty as Nhu, not as smart as Nhu…
Everything is Nhu, Nhu, Nhu!
But now…
I get to be the person I want to be.
Can't believe it can you?
You're right Thao. I can't believe it.
Your life is too perfect.
You wouldn't understand, Nhu.
Okay. If that's all you're gonna say
then I'll just have to ask Vu myself.
Let's hope I don't find out something that could get you in trouble.
Who are you looking for?
Um… Is Nhu home, ma'am?
How do you know Nhu?
Um… I'm a friend of hers from school.
-From school? -Yes, ma'am.
Why haven't I seen you before?
What's your name?
Um… My name is Vu.
-Vu? -Yes ma'am.
No, Nhu isn't home.
She went to a friend's house.
She went to her boyfriend's house!
Quiet! Grown-ups are talking.
She isn't home.
I guess you can go then, huh?
Yes ma'am.
What sort of friend shows up at this hour?
Haha. On a crappy bike too!
Enough. Go to bed.
"ACCOUNT 'NHU BABY' HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DELETED!"
What if he goes and talks to the real Nhu?
If they find out 'Nhu Baby' is actually you, we're screwed.
Really?
Just be careful. You're not the only one involved in this.
And whose fault is that?
Why didn't you think of that when you were getting me naked?
You didn't seem so worried then.
You gotta admit, those pictures I took
were pretty hot, huh?
Sucks that someone else got to post them.
Look at you.
Always showing off on Facebook, this girl and that girl…
But just one little poke,
and you're limp as a gimp.
Hey, I've helped you out a lot.
Oh yeah. You had to give up your phone.
Without me, who else would dare
give Vu those pictures to post on Facebook?
And what about Nhu's stupid locket thing?
So goddamn cheesy!
When I gave it to him, I thought the kid was gonna… ENH!
…right then and there.
Disgusting!
But I gotta say, you're really good.
Even the cops couldn't find him,
but you just tap on a few keys,
and bam! There he is. 'Phong Do Mo Mong.'
How'd you do it?
A friend told me.
Who?
He's helping me out with a few things.
-For free? -Oh, please!
You think you're the only guy who wants to help out a pretty girl?
I have to go.
He's here.
So… do I look pretty?
Uh…
…yeah.
He likes to look at pretty things.
Don't worry.
'Phong Do Mo Mong' will never speak to Nhu again.
I promise.
Time's up, son.
Can you pay now?
Is it real?
A picture that hot has gotta be real.
Who'd post something like that?
'Phong Do Mo Mong' again?
Who do you think?
If he has photos of Thao Nara, he should have pictures of Nhu too.
Those girls are friends you know.
That picture was taken with a Polaroid instant camera.
There's only one of its kind in the world.
You couldn't even make a copy if you wanted to.
There's Nhu.
You bastard! Freak! Pervert!
I'm gonna kill you!
Why? Why did you do it?
Nhu always stood up for you. Why did you do that to her? Huh?
Son of a bitch! Why did you do it?
Answer me!
Someone once said
that before we die
our whole life flashes before our eyes.
Like the most perfect,
most beautiful dream…
In it, we have everything we ever wanted.
And we'll want to live in that dream forever.
But every dream has to end, Phong.
Sooner or later, we all have to wake up.
Vu!
Police in Ward 13, Binh Thanh District report that
blogger Mai Tuan Vu, aka 'Phong Do Mo Mong,'
was found dead in his home yesterday evening.
Mai Tuan Vu was suspected of posting sensitive photos
of several young women on social media…
The account you are calling cannot be reached at the moment.
Please try your call again later.
Even though I can't deny the evidence,
I still don't believe Vu would have done that to me.
You probably think I'm silly huh?
Can I take you home?
No, I'll be okay.
How can you be so reckless!
Now there's a dead kid.
The cops are gonna be all over this for sure!
Are you the "Lord of the Lo"?
Where do you plan to go?
I thought Nhu Quynh wanted you back on her show.
My friend is putting on a big show for me.
It's gonna be kinda huge.
Wait, I deleted that post…
How do you know about it?
Uh… because…
…someone told me. I forgot.
So… is that his car?
Yeah.
Alright, I'm gonna go.
Put away that "Lord of the Lo" face, will you?
Vu solved his own problem for us.
You should be happy.
Just don't tell anyone that you got that from me.
I got it. Now get outta here.
Just two days after the death of blogger Mai Tuan Vu,
also known as 'Phong Do Mo Mong,'
we've received startling news that has shocked the online community.
Pham Thi Mai Thao, aka 'Thao Nara,'
using the fake Facebook account 'Nhu Baby'
took advantage of 'Phong Do Mo Mong's' online following,
and leaked her own nude pictures to gain notice online.
An anonymous classmate turned over this USB drive
containing several chat sessions between Thao and Vu.
detailing 'Thao Nara's' manipulation of 'Phong Do Mo Mong'…
That Thao Nara is really nasty!
We've also learned that a falsified photo of a fellow female student
was leaked online by Thao, and not 'Phong Do Mo Mong' as previously believed.
Pham Thi Mai Thao is currently being sought by the authorities.
Everything related to Thao Nara…
You gave the reporters that USB didn't you?
What USB?
Come on, I know it was you.
How do you know it wasn't Thang? He's better at this than I am.
You're joking! Thang would never do something like that.
The only person into those cheesy heroics is you.
That's nothing. Here's cheesy heroics.
Two pictures.
Shall we go in?
…a falsified photo of a fellow female student
was leaked online by Thao, and not 'Phong Do Mo Mong' as previously believed.
Pham Thi Mai Thao is currently being sought by authorities.
Any information relating to her whereabouts
should be directed to the following hotline: 1900 0012…
Thao, you're the kind of person who would destroy your friends
just to get what you want. Aren't you?
Uh…
…But in the end…
…everyone still loves me…
…right?
That's right! Amazing!
Hey Cai! I want to ask you something.
I know what it is.
It will be embarrassing if someone sees us together.
Nothing embarrassing. We'll get married anyway.
Our wedding must be fun, right?
Yeah, Vang will be the groomsman.
Hey Vang! Wanna come to our wedding?
See! He accepts!
Like it?
Vang. Go playing!
You go serve them
to pay my debt.
Being a maid in Sir Ba's mansion is in a bed of roses, why are you crying?
Stay still!
Raise your head!
You don't look bad.
Be a maid in this house,
you must be here whenever the bell rings,
no matter where you are and no matter what you do.
She's here to take care of the third lady.
You're no better than a dog when you're poor.
I mean my life.
The garden is the only valuable thing we have.
If we sell it… how can we earn our living…
No land no life!
Co… Co…
Where are you going?
Cai, Cai…
Cai… Cai…
Keep doing it!
I just wanna see Cai for once.
Guard!
-Let me. -Cai, Cai!
Cai.
She's now the maid here.
Nobody can see her. Get out!
I just want to tell her one thing.
-Stay there! -He dared to hit me. Take him!
I'll mark him so you guys remember not to let him in.
Wait for me, I'll come to take you back!
How dare you hit Sir Ly?
Gosh, they're here. I have to go.
Co…
Take this money,
Then go south to work at a rubber plantation. You'll earn some money anyway.
Where the heck are you, Co? Come, now!
Break the door down! Arrest him!
Yes!
You want to hide!
-Catch him! Moc, catch him. -There he is.
Stop!
Damn dog, you've bitten me!
Poor him.
If it hadn't been the dog
I'd have put him in jail until he died.
If he kicked his groin,
would it end our lineage?
Don't say such unlucky things.
Sir! Your father has called on you!
Hey!
Send Third Lady this for me.
Tell her it's the lotus tea from Mr. Thuong.
You're now a village chief
who manages hundreds of households.
How could you act like that unreasonably?
Those lowlives will be unruly
and put their feet on our necks if we're not strict with them first.
You're still inexperienced,
remember that, bully the weak and fear the strong.
Moreover, when those crumbs put their feet on our necks,
that's time for our punishment.
Ah,
there is a cup of lotus tea,
my mom asked me to give you.
How kind! Will you thank her for me please?
It's true what they say, that
three ducks make up a noisy market.
Should all three ducks be chubby,
then which one do you want to "eat"?
I used hundreds of doses of aphrodisiac,
but it's bloody useless.
The new bride comes to visit the first and the second lady!
This family has its rules. You have to follow them.
The first rule, you can't live here if you're unable to give birth.
Understand?
Water, water, water
You call this water?
Bring us a drink that we can get drunk on.
It's the essence of nature.
It's very nice of you not to be afraid of a long trip!
Hey, let me down, let me greet Sir Ba's third wife.
Oh almighty God, oh almighty God!
This village is holding a dragon underneath, so it usually gets angry.
This place is sacred but not good.
Hey Moc, go see Mr. Hoang. Quick!
Yes, here is the essence of nature.
If it disappears and appears suddenly,
then my visit will be worthless.
If I fail to find out the "Dragon Vein".
Sir, I thought you came here to do a misfortune cleansing ritual
and prepare meds so that the third lady can get pregnant soon?
Insolent!
Your third lady is a blue-blood.
Her child must be a blue-blooded son.
But it can only happen if she drinks water from the Dragon Vein.
-Got it? -Yes Sir!
How kind! Thank you very much!
Moc!
Look! The Dragon Vein!
You two want Mr. Hac?
Ah!
We were just passing by and saw the well, so we just want to ask for some water.
Some people just stare at his garden, so suspicious!
They just messed with Sir Ba's family,
Don't get involved with them or you'll get in trouble.
Mr. Hac, listen to the official's order!
You must quickly come to the community house for a hearing.
Hurry up!
Sir, what am I guilty of?
Your fault is…
being the father of the one who dared oppose the village chief.
My son wouldn't say boo to a goose,
SirLy must have…
Your son kicked Sir Ly's groin,
you keep denying it, huh?
Co has gone to work at a rubber plantation in the south.
How can you judge him and why did you bring me here?
That's it!
Then we have to take you to the sub-prefecture
so the officials can interrogate you.
-Police commissioner Truong? -Yes.
No, who will feed Vang if I'm taken to the sub-prefecture?
Wait,
we can reconsider because it seems you're a good person.
But we have been here early for your hearing.
Are you really gonna let us
leave with nothing?
How is it?
-This is top secret, -Yes.
can't say it in public.
Sir Ba's family have been living on the dragon without knowing.
This brings you both good fortune and misfortune.
Despite how wealthy and powerful you are,
your lineage seems to be uneasy.
You're right!
My son is already grow-up but he hasn't got married yet.
Whatever our advice he never minds.
It's my own thing, mom and the second lady please don’t mind.
Shut up!
The village chief
who manages thousands of villagers that look down on nature is unacceptable.
A sudden death may come to you at anytime.
Everything is up to you.
I Ba Kien assure a great reward for you.
This old well is the "Dragon Vein".
Whoever has the "Dragon Vein" will own the whole world.
Should you want peace and fortune,
you must move your ancestor's grave here.
Mr. Hoang, how about my third wife's pregnancy?
Told you.
You have the "Dragon Vein", you have everything.
Just use the water from that well for the making of medicines.
It's not possible, ma'am.
My husband feels sympathy for your situation
so he offers you such a high price as this.
This is my ancestor's land.
I can't sell it, ma'am!
Your garden looks green, doesn’t it?
There wasn't a drop of rain last month,
but thanks to this well. So now you see!
My garden is still growing well like this!
Honestly, there is a fortune teller
saying that my sickness can only be cured by water from your well.
So I'm here to…
Please just ask him to come here for water,
I don't mind.
What?
Refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit! Let me see!
Shut up, don't you know who I am?
Moc. Mung!
-Yes! You called me. -Help!
Hey, the girls baling water By the road
Why did you bale the moonlight out too?
My moonlight
Hey, the guy is hoeing up The ground there
Don't be curious You will cut your leg
Or even your c…o…ck.
Sir Ly is here. Can I tell you something?
Nonsense! Go to the village's communal house to tell.
Sir Ly, you like the girl in pink or yellow? I can be the matchmaker!
I don't like female villagers.
Hey, Sir Ly!
You're like the star fruit Falling into the garden
I'm like the girl craving for sour things
Craving for soul things
Hey hey,
why on earth have we a man who always runs away when he sees girls?
The other day I passed by your garden
with the third lady and the fortune teller.
I know.
He told Sir Ba that the well
-Hi, Sir Ly. -Hi.
He's so scary!
Sir Ba's eldest son?
The day I left, he was as timid as a rabbit.
Now he's the chief.
Recognize me?
Binh Tu?
You guys must learn by heart the poem I've taught.
Yes!
Pray God for rain
So we have water to drink
Have fields to work on
Have bowls full of rice
Have brooms to clean the house
-The rooster picks rice -Excuse me teacher,
I want to ask if we have many rivers in the place where Co is living?
Phu Rieng is located in Dong Nai province, it has lots of rivers.
We have been through some harvests since he left here…
but I haven't heard anything from him yet.
Then…
I've come to ask you to write him a letter.
Do you know his address?
No.
Once sent, it will arrive one way or another.
So wait, I'll get ink and paper.
You already knew that letter couldn't be sent,
why do you still lie to him?
Sometimes we can't just tell the truth, but
honest white lies may help.
In this village,
they'll call you a fool if you're gentle.
Once a fool, forever a fool.
Damn it!
Nobody comes to see me?
When were you back and why didn't you inform me?
I have spent two years in prison, spent three years in the military,
I didn't fear arrows or bullets though.
Then I fucking fear nobody!
Hey Binh Tu, watch your mouth as you're currently in the community house.
You shouldn't swear like that in front of your wife and kid anyway.
Wife?
She told me everything.
Fuck,
The deputy village chief passed by after gambling late.
You, village commissioner, also flirted with my wife.
Even you too, police commissioner Truong.
All of you!
Binh Tu, do you know how defamation would be punished?
You slut!
Am I right?
Speak!
Have you all seen it?
Have you all heard it clearly? I'll kill her if she lies.
And I will kill anyone who dares to flirt with my wife.
I wanna go to jail now!
Oh dear, it's Binh Tu here.
How brave!
Hi Sir Ba!
A brave man shouldn't let his family live in poverty like this.
Go buy food and clothes for your kids.
Thank you, sir.
And you.
Why don't we have a drink together?
Co!
It's been years and you have not written me any letters.
Vang and I miss you so much!
Hey, Vang! Catch this.
Oh Vang! You're home.
Why are you home so late, I was really worried!
Good boy. Stay still, let me see!
Oh…
Why did you take it back?
You…
You wet my letter.
If your dad doesn't get that letter he'll hate you!
Got it? I'll ignore you!
Ah no. No.
I love you. Nobody loves you as I do!
Let me write another letter
to send to your dad! Stay still!
Ah oi…
Ah…
An ant tried to shake a big tree
You rejected me for being poor
Who else would you marry to be rich
Ah oi
Where are you taking the buffalos to?
This is my garden.
Get out… Get out.
Vang, Vang!
-Go! -Quick!
Get out!
Vang.
-Go away… -Go.
Get out of my garden…
‎Get out.
-Get out. -Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you doing that? Call your buffaloes back.
I beg you.
-Don't take away my buffaloes. -Go.
Sir, these people are not from our village.
Call on those buffaloes to get out.
Catch them all.
I will leave them to rot in jail for vandalism.
Yes! Go.
You keep planting, they keep destroying.
You can't fight against them alone.
Your neighbors cannot help you in this matter.
I cannot be here in time to help you because it's too far.
Please go back home, leave me alone.
My father still wants to buy your land.
Your tax payment is due soon, by the way…
have you prepared enough money yet?
Good…
Good boy!
Tie like this to ease your pain, okay!
Right…let me see…
Have you heard it?
Mr. Hac's garden was badly destroyed!
Gosh!
He's such a nice man,
who would ever do that to him?
I suppose…
I only dare to say when Sir Ba is not home.
Nothing, he'll kill me if he knows I'm blabbing.
What happens here, stays here.
Understand?
Yes! Understood!
But…
I care about Mr. Hac.
All the water for your medicines
is from the well at Mr. Hac's place.
Hey,
where are you taking my books to?
It's no use keeping them!
Sell them to get money to help people.
My god!
Do you know all these books are rare?
These books are rare, but can't be turned into medicines.
Don't you recognize that Mr. Hac is getting skinny?
Teacher, you want to cross the river?
Remember the day when the levée breached,
I threw all the clothes and stuff just to save these books.
See, there are still lots of water stains here.
We cannot sell these books.
We will find another way to help Mr.Hac.
-Go there to clean. -Yes.
Thanks for helping me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let us know if you need assistance next time.
This is a gift from Sir Ba.
Please!
Drink to forget everything.
Regarding Mr. Hac's garden,
don't push him too far, my dear!
I heard that a gang of buffalos came to destroy his garden
and Ly Cuong was the instigator.
It's none of your business.
Your business is to get pregnant.
You've been here for several years.
Still no child.
My two other wives won't let you
live in peace if you're still childless. Got that?
Cai.
Cai…
I will come back when I have enough money.
I will take you out.
Wait for me!
Vang! Why are you here alone?
Sometimes he gets here, he may miss Co.
Do you have any news of Co?
Please come in and have tea.
I come here today… honestly,
I would like to ask you to teach me to write.
You should learn from childhood,
now it's really hard for you to remember.
I will try my best.
I want to write to Co by myself.
This is letter "A", round shape, with a hook.
Remember?
Letter "A" looks like an egg with a fishhook.
Good, now…good boy, good boy.
Remember?
Vang! I owe you a life.
Understand what I'm saying?
He will get better if he is fed.
Yes, thank you.
If you hadn't helped,
I wouldn't have been able to survive and reunite with my family.
Not a big deal.
We're all neighbors, so don't mention it.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I gotta go.
Someone wants to harm you deliberately.
Then please take care!
Kick it!
Dismiss!
Who the hell dares stop the fight?
Dismiss now!
I asked who the hell is rudely speaking?
Your father is speaking.
My apology, father, I didn't notice.
Get lost!
Sir Ly, you don't have anything else to care for other than these cockfights?
I do deal with many important things, keep the population and land records,
collect taxes,
-Really? -prevent riots,
-and… -Stop.
The most important thing right now is to take the "Dragon Vein."
The ancestor's grave must be moved before the Tet holiday.
Dog bait.
Oh my god!
Vang, Vang, Vang…
Where are you Vang? Vang, Vang…
Oh my God.
Vang is here…
Do you know someone is trying to harm you?
Stupid. Stupid.
You're stupid.
You have to put it into his food to poison him.
Stop!
You're grown-up but not smart.
I need the well, I need the land.
Why do you just keep worrying about that dog?
That goddamn dog.
You eat.
I know that you're not full yet.
Here… Here… Yeah
Come on. Let eat … good
It is fine for me to hungry a bit. I am getting used to it.
Come on…good boy.
I don't know if I have anything else to feed you next?
Teacher! Teacher!
What happened?
Someone wants to destroy your garden again?
I have no choice but to sell Vang.
Why do you have to do that?
There's nothing left for him to eat.
It will be a good deal if we sell him now.
My tax payment is due soon, anyway.
Just wait, perhaps we will find another solution.
Why do you have to come here just to say this?
I'm afraid Vang will hear this.
He'll be sad.
Poor him!
Not sure if he heard what I just said to you guys?
I must go home now.
Vang! Let's go home.
Ma'am! You want to take medicine right now or later?
Give it to me.
Ma'am… How are you?
Let me see.
Cai. Take her to get rest,
Yes, ma'am.
Give her some water.
Yes, ma'am.
Be careful.
She acts as if she were a princess.
She was still a peasant on the field few years ago.
She's lucky our husband brought her as his third wife.
You shut up!
Why do you nag me?
From the look of things, she is already pregnant.
You'd better worry about yourself.
Please enter the temple. I'll wait outside.
Why do you want to see me, ma'am?
Please don't call me ma'am.
I'm just the same age as your child.
I'm from the south.
We were so poor I had to become Sir Ba's third wife.
I and Cai are alike.
I'm pregnant because of the water from your well.
Will anyone get an incense burner please?
Let me do it.
How is it?
Congratulations! It's a boy!
The conception has occurred right in zodiac period.
He will be born to be a person of rank.
How blessed! All your prayers are answered.
Great bliss… great bliss.
We must open a big party to celebrate this event.
The third lady's not here yet.
Sir! musical instruments are ready.
Do you want to start now?
Hold on,
I want my son to be able to hear the music from his mom's belly.
Play it.
Now we are men of wealth
Be grateful to the creator
Life is like a dream
You dream of the great thing
I dream of you
Ma'am.
-Take the third lady in. -Yes sir.
Hurry up!
You guys hide inside.
But… please just catch him till he finishes his food.
Hey…
Hurry up. Nobody pays such a high price like us.
Hey…
Where is Vang?
Vang… come here to eat.
Vang… Come home to eat.
Hey… Vang…
Come here…
This tastes good!
This tastes good! Hey… Eat… Hey…
This is your favorite. Just eat…
Come here.
Eat…
Vang…
Eat…
No.
Catch him.
Catch him.
The diamond, have you found the diamond to cut yet?
Just wait.
You're still tired, where do you want to go?
I want to buy some star-fruits,
been craving for sour things.
-Moc. -Yes.
You go with the third lady.
I already called Cai.
-Oops! -I’m over here. Let's hide.
Gotcha.
Wrong one… Wrong one…
Then I'll just try one more time!
Will your parents accept a poor guy like me?
My mom likes you.
The problem is my dad.
But my dad loves me a lot.
You pestle these gingers finely, then use them for the third lady's foot soak.
Yes sir.
-Hi Sir Ly. -Ah…
Binh Tu, I have a task for you.
What is it?
Have you seen if Mr. Hac's garden is growing well again?
You and your dad have not given him enough trouble yet?
Fine if you're not interested in money,
I will easily find another one.
You want to hurt him, you must kill me first.
I'm Ly Cuong,
not my father.
So I will treat you differently.
The sky is high above our heads
Move the cloud And you'll see the blue sky
You bring it to Mr. Hac.
You treasure these books very much, don't you?
You won't earn much by selling them.
Books are dirt cheap in the decline of culture.
You think you can escape by jumping into water?
Vang.
I am going to buy wine.
Stop, are you gonna let me do it alone?
I'll be right back.
Don't be smart with me.
You want to take some money for wine?
Then we will go together.
Wine here, wine here.
Good wine.
Got all the seasonings?
Don't worry, the bunch of apricot leaves is enough.
Ma'am, please have some porridge.
Gamecock legs cooked with green peas are really healthy.
Have you…
Oh dear, your health is more important than this cock.
I cooked it myself. The lotus tea can't compare with this.
It's delicious!
I can give you whatever you like.
The troupe came here last time is excellent.
Can you invite them again?
Everyone?
Yeah!
Do I have to introduce myself?
If not, how can we know who you are.
I… I'm Teu, born in Meu Village.
Good people, I give money,
bad people, I give a punch.
My skin is fair because I love sunlight.
My voice is echoing because I love singing.
Do you guys recognize my voice?
Yes!
I miss every single acquaintance of mine.
I hope to see them again.
Why are you doing this job?
Because it brings me the chance to find you.
I have been traveling from place to place for years.
Do you hate my parents
since they forced me to get married for money?
I'm used to tragedies.
I'm satisfied, seeing you this time.
Do you have a good life as the third wife of Sir Ba?
No love, no happiness,
it's a marriage in name only!
Hey, we see each other every once in a while.
Why are you crying?
Ma'am!
The puppet show is done.
I have to go now.
Mo!
I'm staying here in a few days.
We'll meet again.
You're home?
Vang… Come here with me.
Oh… Good boy… Good boy
Hey… Hey… Listen to me.
Days without you are really sad! You know what?
The house is so empty without you.
I thought you would never come back.
Hey… Stay still…
Ew… Where have you been? Why are you so dirty?
Let me see whether you get lice or not!
Stay still. I'll help you search for lice, if any.
Good boy.
God…
How can you come back here?
I already took their money.
Go… Go away…
You're no longer my dog. You belong to someone else now.
Get out… Get out now… Go away…
Please forgive me.
Please don't hate me.
I love you to the moon and back.
Vang…
Tell the truth or die.
Why did you and the third lady come home late after the show?
Ma'am, we came home right after the show.
Liar.
Someone saw you were looking for the third lady at the end of the show.
Is it true?
No, I swear.
You swear, you swear… you swear.
-I swear it was true! -Swear… Swear.
Fool… where is the evidence?
It's a shame if it's exposed.
It's obviously adultery.
There's only one way to hide this.
Hurry up.
Ly… Ly…
I need your help,
it's…
-You go first. -Yes.
I know what it is,
but his fault is quite big.
We're just old acquaintances.
Please have mercy on him.
I will jump into the fire,
or I will even die if you tell me to do so.
But what do I get in return?
Tell me what you like, I can ask Sir Ba to prepare it.
There are things that only you can give me.
But if you're not okay with my request, I'll go now.
Ly… Ly, calm down.
No, I will be dead if Sir Ba finds out.
Why do you have to fear my father
while I'm really in charge here?
while I'm really in charge here? No… It can't be.
I thought you didn't get married because…
Because I'm not into girls, right?
All the girls in this village are nothing to me.
You know why? Because of you.
No, please…please don't
I thought you wanted to trade your life for his life.
It's day now.
Wait for me at the granary tonight.
You will have everything you want.
Nobody has ever dared to break the promise with me.
Remember that.
Please don't forget what I asked earlier.
Sir, they all hid away.
Find them.
-Yes sir. -Yes sir.
Lucky for you that I keep my promises.
Damn it.
A dependant
is not a real man!
-Let me go! -Go.
Go! Quick!
Let my husband and children go. Get off me!
Go with me!
Fuck it!
-Quick! -Let me go…
She deserves a head shaving, then tie her and float her down the river.
But she's carrying my own son in her belly.
She will be punished after giving birth.
Hey.
You stay home and guard her well.
Sir, but if she needs…
Only Cai can bring her food and water.
Yes.
That slut doesn't even deserve dregs.
Did you see Binh Tu?
Bring Pham Van Hac, Pham Van Co here.
On your knees.
Why is there only the father here?
Where is the ungrateful son?
The Judge,
everyone knows that Co went to work at a rubber plantation in the south long ago.
Rules are rules.
Long undeclared absence now counts as presence in the area.
All types of taxes must be fully paid anyway.
Land tax and poll tax for two people
are nine Dong in total.
are nine Dong in total. Nine Dong?
How can I have nine Dong?
Taxes are compulsory.
People in this village are so stubborn indeed.
Judge, according to
the customs of the council of notables, one's properties
will be seized and then put on sale if one cannot pay enough tax.
In addition, the village chief suggests that the indictee must pay nine Dong
as a penalty for age fabrication. So it's 18 Dong in total.
I'm innocent, Judge!
I'm over 60 this year,
which means I don't need to pay taxes. That's the law.
The Judge, according to the record,
Pham Van Hac was born in the year of the snake,
which means he's 47 now.
Judge, please look at me.
Does anyone believe I'm only 47 years old?
There is neither witness
nor birth certificate for this man.
-Guards! -Yes.
Wait.
Okay, as per Sir Ba's advice,
and that you're also an old man
I give you three days to pay your taxes,
otherwise you will be taken to the sub-prefecture.
That land has to be mine.
You're wrong, Sir.
That land belongs to my son, Co.
Stop, you can't fight against me.
You will lose, and I will win anyway.
Let's… see.
Quick!
I want to see The Judge.
For what?
I want to sue the chief and his dad.
Sue for what?
For forcing Mr. Pham Van Hac and for attempted demolition.
Let me see.
An ant is trying to shake a big tree.
Okay, just take it and go home, I will check it tomorrow.
I'll go to the county or district
to sue them if it it's not possible to do so here.
Keep drinking.
-Catch him. -Yes sir.
Teacher. Let go of my teacher.
This is evidence of an attempted anti-government riot.
My husband is not guilty. Please let him go.
-What the hell are you doing? -Release my husband…
Let him go…
Sir Ba, I want to see him.
Where is Sir Ba? I need to see him.
Moc. Moc, where is Mung?
Ma'am, I'm guarding down here.
Anybody!
Sir Ba.
What happened?
Sir Ba, give me a bottle of wine.
No wine for the son of a bitch. Get out.
-Guards! -Yes!
How stingy! I don't fucking need it anymore.
Moc, who is guarding the granary? Why are you here?
Your wound doesn't heal yet,
be careful.
I don't know how to thank you.
Quick!
Let me do that by myself.
No Ly, please don't.
I got pregnant with your father.
So what? You have to be mine.
Mo.
We won't escape if we don't go faster.
You're so kind.
I'm broke now so. I don't know how to repay you?
I don't do this for money.
Then why did you save us?
You know Vang, Mr. Hac's dog?
A dog even knows how to behave kindly towards others,
while people don't.
-Stop! -Hurry up.
Stop! Catch them!
Catch them!
No!
Here, have some.
It's not as good as the food back in the day.
Now we are broke,
then we don't have any choice.
Please eat, Vang.
Mr. Hac!
Why is it so noisy?
I'm going to visit my husband, so can you watch my house please?
Why are they so cruel?
We are all neighbors but some still treat their neighbors as wild animals.
They have power.
We are just lowlifes,
it's like throwing eggs against rocks.
Don't be pessimistic.
We still don't know who is better,
teacher!
Co!
I keep this land
as a marriage portion for you.
This cup of wine I drink with you, my wife.
I'm seeing you soon.
We can be together again.
I'm so happy.
Hac, who led a decent life Please rest in peace
Please rest in peace…
Mr. Hac, please rest in peace…
Find that document at all costs.
Hurry up… hurry up.
Dig… Keep digging.
Think you can bring the document with you?
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Sir, I'm scared.
Useless!
It's just been buried, nothing to be scared of!
Hey, beat him up.
Kill him.
Beat them up!
I have enough money to take Cai out.
Sir Ba? Where's Sir Ba?
The "Dragon Vein"…the "Dragon Vein"…
The "Dragon's vein"…
I'm not Ly Cuong, Don't bite me…
You still want to go?
There's nothing worth staying for here.
Teacher,
Teacher!
Please help me
Should know the depth of martial arts
And master the movement of your body
Let the storm be your strike
Those who seek the peak of a fight

Those who seek the peak of a fight

My Ngoc Tran Ngan Dai is the most powerful.
Can't compare to my Lao Mai Quyen.
Trung Binh Tan is the best.
What are stances good for?
18 exercises of horse stance!
How many would it be when I learn movements?
Lower, a bit lower. Keep your back straight.
It'll be 36 when it comes to movements.
What? 36?
Hi teacher Phong.
Martial arts is to build your body…
Not to beat people. You say that everyday.
You guys find Khoa?
We're looking for Khoa to… fly a kite.
Has Khoa finished practicing?
It's enough for today. Go hang out.
Go, quickly.
My dad's Hung Ke Quyen is the most powerful here.
One day I'll become the number one fighter like him.
You're coughing like a rooster. How powerful!
Rooster is Ke, just like the movements I've been practicing.
Why are you staring at me? Wanna eat the rooster?
You pervert.
About tomorrow… Shall we… Just friendly.
We should do that sometimes…
to know where we're at.
Come on… Fighting… Fighting.
Is he from the city?
Yeah, he can't beat our teacher Phong. He's the best fighter in our hometown.
Hung Ke Quyen.
Khoa, study.
Hung Ke Quyen.
Hung Ke Quyen.
Dad! Fighting!
‎Hung Ke Quyen.
Dad!
Dad.
Dad, are you okay, dad?
Dad, are you okay?
Dad, are you alright?
Dad! Are you alright?
Mom, why did everybody quit?
Khoa.
I want to keep learning. I want to learn Hung Ke Quyen!
Khoa.
Is this your Hung Ke Quyen? Loser.
Even his dad lost, not to mention him.
He didn't lose.
He died, so he lost.
My dad didn't lose, my dad didn't lose!
Stop!
My dad didn't lose, get out.
My dad didn't lose.
My dad didn't lose…
-Here you are. -Thank you.
What? Huh? Never seen a single man?
Uncle… My mom…
Hey, I've been a virgin for 40 years.
Never had a kid before.
You're making a scene with the wrong person.
But my mom… Uncle!
Get lost.
Uncle… Let me finish.
My mom is Tai. Ba Tai, from Binh Dinh.
-My mom… -What?
Tell your mom to come here.
She's in…
Tell her not to be shy, come here.
I mean, it's only me here. She's in our hometown.
-She's in her hometown? -Yes.
Now it's me who is embarrassed.
Gosh, I thought your mom was here, so…
Then?
What now?
My mom has a letter for you.
Geez… Who writes letters nowadays?
"Dear Quang,"
-So lovable. -Yes.
"Although you're not my husband,
and Khoa, although he's not your son
you have to treat him right."
What? What does that mean?
Hey, behave well.
If you ever try drugs, gambling, prostitutes, weed…
-I'll beat you up. -Yes.
Hey.
-Where are you going? -My room.
First thing first,
one-month deposit, one-month payment,
Two million in total.
Beat him, yeah.
Hide!
Throw a hook!
Knock him out.
Go, knock him out!
Yeah, we won.
Cao Thien Hoang won. What a big win.
Yeah. White and big.
-What is white and big? -No.
-Big win. -Big win, big win.
-Big win. -Big win…
You have to know what is just for watching.
Okay…
I know, uncle Quang is taking good care of me.
Don't worry mom, okay.
Okay…
One coffee please,
Oh please, I'm not disabled. Stop bothering me.
Thief!
Thief, thief, thief. Catch him!
Get out!
You chose the wrong day to rob me.
Allow me.
Go!
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm alright, I'm okay.
Hey!
Your money or your life!
Where are you going? I'll give you a lift.
Wow, great.
Hey, wear this.
Thanks for your help.
-I'm Khanh Trang. -Ah, right… I'm Khoa.
Where are we going?
Van Lang University.
Ah… VL.
I'm a sophomore there.
Wow… Turns out I'm going to the same school with you, sister.
Hey, don't call me elder sister. Girls are sensitive about their age.
Ah no, you're still young though.
Hey, let's go to the council meeting.
Hey, when you return the shirt, come to the Vietnamese Martial Arts club,
tell them to pass it to Khanh Trang.
Hey, who is that good-looking guy?
We just met on the street. A freshman.
Really? Cool!
Hey, I have to admit, you are a carnivore,
any guy with you is beaten up. Cool!
Go, Nhat Anh.
Hi.
Everyone get in your seat, quickly!
Hello, Trang's friend, right?
-Yeah, hello. -I'm Trang's friend too. What's your name?
I'm Anh Khoa
Anh Khoa.
What? You just called yourself "minh"?
"Minh" is for spouses to call their partners
or used between lovers.
Or you think I'm your spouse?
-Right? -I don't mean it.
You don't mean it? So sad though.
By the way, I'm Nhat Anh. Let's be friends.
-Nhat Anh. -Okay Nhat Anh
Actually my nickname is "Baby", and I'm younger than you.
Can you call me "Baby"?
No? You have no chill!
Silence, silence please. You guys are all here?
Our chairman has said that
enrolling in clubs is compulsory
for end-of-term evaluation.
There are many different clubs for you to choose
based on your hobbies,
like yoga or aerobics.
If you love dancing,
join my club.
Among all clubs,
there is an MMA DC club.
MMA is a freestyle martial arts
made up of various combat sports and martial arts
like boxing, kickboxing, muay, or judo.
A full-contact combat sport.
The club's chairman is Cao Thien Hoang, a junior.
That is our club.
What are you doing?
Why are you interrupting my speech? How rude!
Look at your colorful heads. Go back to your seats!
My dear friends,
aside from MMA,
we also have a Vietnamese Martial Arts club.
The club features Vietnam's traditional martial arts,
led by martial artist Ba Long,
a senior at our school.
You guys must have heard about him, right?
Is that similar to Binh Dinh Martial Arts?
Like this?
Wow,
You treat me with Binh Dinh's Tre on my first visit to your house?
What will I get the next time…
I'm gonna eat this… So in love with this.
Excellent, yummy.
You know what? Vietnamese Martial Arts club features
all traditional martial arts in Vietnam.
I know everything.
You know these guys from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?
They're truly Kung Fu masters.
They can fight, they can flip,
they can fly, they can break walls.
Literally they can do everything!
-Why does it sound like a thief? -Right.
No, no. Here, oh god.
Ah! Our school's Cao Thien Hoang.
You should focus on this guy, Ba Long.
-Hung Ke Quyen. -Exactly.
Wow, so cool.
Ba Long is great.
He's a senior, also a great fighter in our Vietnamese Martial Arts club.
Recently, our Vietnamese Martial Arts club and the MMA club
had a friendly match.
Despite his shoulder injury,
Ba Long won by Hung Ke Quyen.
This place looks nice.
Anyway, my place still has vacancies, want to move there?
My place is clean and neat.
No, I can't. My mom wants me to live here.
Haizz, living alone is unsafe. Right?
It's much safer
to live with another, right?
So silly, come to…
Hey Khoa
Ah uncle… This is my friend, also my schoolmate.
He visits to know where I live, so we can study together.
Ah a friend…
Hi uncle
I'm not married.
It's late now so I'm gonna go home.
I'm going home now, see you later.
I wish you health…
OMG, what a headache.
Perfect.
Hi.
Is this the Vietnamese Martial Arts club?
What a clown.
Don't know.
I came to return a shirt to Khanh Trang.
Oh… hey… Khanh Trang.
Someone must be sneezing right now.
Stop!
Stop!
Why did you come here to fight?
Chan, apologize to Long.
Sorry.
We just passed by to see how your club is training.
Here.
Hey, keep training, don't let the kids win too soon.
Let's go.
Bye!
You, stay away from Khanh Trang.
-Thank you! -Uhm, are you okay?
A bit hurt, but it's okay.
-Come on, it's our turn now. -Go all the way.
They treat us like we are invisible.
Gotta show them who's the boss in this school.
That's right, Long, go for it.
Hoang, stop doing that.
Don't come to my brother's place and do that again.
How dare I do anything to Long? But…
I'll beat any guy you date.
Hi… Hey, I'll scream if you don't let me in.
No, don't come in.
Pervert, rapist, pervert!
Huh? How do you know I live here?
Nhat Anh, the little bird.
Sorry, you were beaten this morning because of me.
Try this. It's homemade.
Thanks. It's not your fault anyway.
I have something for you. Follow me.
Hello.
-You were in your room? -Yeah.
Wow, Casanova.
No, this is my schoolmate.
She came here so we can study together.
I've heard this before.
Hello.
Tada… My old bike. Just use it for now!
Err… Is it a bit too feminine?
It's cute, give it a try.
OK.
Go.
Hey Casanova…
Don't come home late or you'll stay outside.
I know.
He's just been here a few days, and he's surrounded by boys and girls.
Oh my gosh!
Men's talk?
Done. You two are really close!
I've only known her for a few days though!
I'm Long, Trang's brother. This is Tri.
Ah yes, Nhat Anh showed me the video before.
You won by Hung Ke Quyen. Great win.
His shoulder twisted after the win though.
-It's fine now. -Bro, Khoa also loves martial arts!
I've been into it since I was a kid but have not found any place to study.
Especially Vietnamese Martial Arts.
It's hard to find young people loving Vietnamese Martial Arts nowadays.
Come on.
Mom, I have something to say.
In an international school, besides English,
it's really important to join clubs,
like different communities and sports.
So I decided to choose Vietnamese Martial Arts.
I've told you.
It's your passion
but you have to care for the people around you.
No martial arts.
Okay, I know.
Bro!
Continue.
Hello.
Everyone comes here.
This is Anh Khoa, freshman, our new member.
This is Tri, A Lu and Alex.
They are my coaching assistants.
Hello everyone.
If you need any help, just call us two!
Who are "us two"? Wanna fight? Remove your hand.
-Tell me if anyone bullies you. -Okay.
Tell me if someone bullies you.
We'll have an inter-school competition in two months.
We have to win.
Yes!
We can work hard to achieve that, okay?
Okay.
Okay… Everyone keep on practicing.
Those who seek the peak of a fight
Should know the depth of martial arts
And master the movement of your body
Let the storm be your strike
And the floating cloud be your move
Shape your mind like water That your enemy will fail to catch
Two, three.
You're dead wrong.
They say, "We all should practice martial arts,
so we can protect our homeland at all costs."
Okay. Very good.
You surprised me.
Can I ask something? Ouch, are you okay?
I just did the Invisible Kick. You'll learn it one day.
Now just hold your stance.
A Lu.
Do you know when I can learn Hung Ke Quyen?
You'll learn when Long teaches you. Now you have to hold your stance.
-To control my breath? -Yeah.
I've heard that all my life!
Really? So you have to wait for your life to end then.
You're gonna hear that many times more.
Practice your basic techniques,
you can't learn any movement without them.
I got it.
Work hard! I'll go now.
I feel stuffy.
Darling!
Embarrassing.
Nothing to be embarrassed about.
Wow, what is that powerful movement?
Lao Mai Quyen.
This is Trang's special secret weapon.
Just beat it, not gonna hit me though.
-Scared of me now? -Scared? Hell no.
Enough, enough, you two.
Come here quickly. What are you doing?
Why do you guys always stick together?
Hey… I really love this…
I hope you will teach me.
No. I can't teach you this.
We'll all die if my brother finds out.
"We"? That shouldn't be the case.
Should or shouldn't what?
Nothing.
Long and I are talking about Hoang's MMA competition videos.
Do you guys know this channel?
You don't need to know.
This is the latest video of Hoang fighting the Karate Full Bright team.
Watch!
Why do I see it as similar to smack down?
It's not acting. That is a real fight.
If he's fighting like this against our club then…
The inter-school competition has its own rules. Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Hey, it's the perfect time to go swimming. Wanna go?
Nhat Anh! Come here.
Why do they always show off?
Hey, if you won't swim, then go buy me some food.
Geez, you're acting like a queen now.
Nhat Anh! I've just swum for a while and it is empty now.
What? Empty?
Ah your stomach? Got it, wait a bit…
Why do you keep looking at me?
Because… you're beautiful.
Wow, didn't expect you to be this flirty.
Did it work though?
Hey, don't forget my brother is your teacher now!
Right.
Long treats you so nice.
It must be fun when you're home!
Not as much as you think.
My brother and parents don't get along
since they want him to take over my family's business…
instead of doing martial arts.
Did he do what your parents asked?
Of course… not.
That's why he's moved out for a few years now.
Hey, change the topic.
What topic?
Then talk about love!
You and Hoang, you guys…
Are you guys really this curious?
Because… I want to know.
Okay I'll tell you then.
When I first came here last year, he flirted with me.
He seems like a cool and handsome guy, so I was into him a bit.
But then all he cared about was winning,
not to mention his jealousy.
He messed up with anyone friending me on Facebook.
I didn't feel like we could continue, so we broke up.
How about you?
Can we be together for a long time?
Kidding, we just got to know each other.
Huh? I didn't think anything.
But I already thought about it.
Kidding again… You're so gullible.
Hey, why are you so tense?
Huh?
Never mind, forget about it.
-Jesus! -You scared me.
Just like a thief.
Learn the Lao Mai Quyen song.
Lao Mai Quyen.
Apricot blossoms
Walking on the cloud
Stepping back to stance
It's all about inner power.
In one year, you can blow out the candles, In a few years, you can tear the clothes.
Please.
Hey, I told you to focus on your inner power, not powerful fists.
Lao Mai is much more powerful than I thought.
Of course, I'm not that easy to bully.
Think about it carefully. I'll check frequently.
This old apricot blossom is difficult as hell.
That apricot blossom is "Mai"?
Not that simple.
The old monkey waits patiently
Then suddenly attack
Butterflies wander around
The moon looks like a hook that you throw
Do you know Lao Mai means old monkey in our hometown?
Change your leg, see? Turn around, yes…
Then, push your body… See? Give me a fulcrum and I will…
Here.
Wow, fruit. I love you the best.
Smooth talker!
I have to be one, or you guys won't allow me to dance.
Practice like this and you want to win?
Like the U13 champion?
Sorry, I'm exhausted today.
Sorry… Why don't you say sorry on the stage?
From now on, you will practice six hours a day.
Okay?
Hey, there are more fires in buildings recently.
I did it! Was I good?
Busted!
Hey, keep your distance. What are you doing?
You're a fast learner!
Thank you.
Hey, wanna see me perform?
There will be many
famous underground bands in Saigon to perform at that place tomorrow.
You've never watched our performances, right?
Okay… Tomorrow!
Good?
More than good. You've been superb.
I was lucky.
I've been practicing for a month but still failed.
But I still tried anyway, to see how far I can go.
Wake up, wake up. Go home.
You must be happy seeing me perform last night!
Unrequited love
Sometimes I'm happy to see you smile
Do you know that I've fallen for you?
Sometimes I'm innocent with you
And still telling myself not to confess
So we can still be together
-God, oh god. -Are you alright?
You, you tripped me.
-Liar. It was you who tripped us. -What?
Hey, that was clueless. I was raising my leg a bit too high.
Hey! Vietnamese Martial Arts club is messing with us.
Shut up, you guys are too much.
Why trip other people?
Let's go, I'm afraid they'll bite us, then we have to go for a vaccine.
Hey, who are you talking about?
-You. -They called us dogs.
-Am I wrong though? -You.
Let's go.
Hey you coward! Trang didn't let you sleep last night?
Hey, don't mention her!
I like to, so what?
Only a freshman and you think you can get the school's hottest girl.
-How brave! -What are you talking about?
Hey, Vietnamese Martial Arts club hits people!
They beat people, they beat people.
Don't think I'm easy-going so you can bully me.
Chan.
Why do you keep messing up?
Only because this school is too small.
What?
You saw that,
A club always worshiping sportsmanship now messes around.
Oh god, how can you say that?
Shut up, stop making things up like that!
That was wrong though. Everyone saw he beat Chan. Right?
Right?
You guys talked about Trang first.
I don't know why, but everyone saw you guys beat our people.
Now how do you plan to deal with that?
This is not related to the Vietnamese Martial Arts club.
Okay if you already said so.
Let it go, Khoa.
I haven't finished yet.
I don't want to be known as a freshman bully.
So if Khoa can hit me once,
I'll let it go.
Don't be so clueless.
Oh, I forgot to say.
-I'm not using my arms though. -Don't need to do that.
Let it go Khoa. No fighting.
It was because of me. You're afraid that I'll lose?
-Khoa. -Let's start.
Khoa… Khoa.
A friendly match only, okay?
Stop.
Stop.
Sorry, I haven't competed with you for a while.
I thought your shoulder had recovered.
Do what you want at the competition.
Let's go, so Long can rest.
Are you okay Khoa? Suddenly you started a fight at school.
What would happen to the club's prestige
if the school board hears about this?
Tri, he was tripped. We can quit the competition, just chill.
Hey, don't quarrel.
We're all club members.
Sorry.
Sorry? Do you know how long we have been waiting for this?
Stop.
Today's session ends early. Everyone goes home.
Khoa, stay here with me.
I'll boil some eggs you can use later.
Fighting.
You have quick reactions and raw talent with sharp techniques.
But when you meet the strong opponents, you'll die not holding your stance still.
Why did you do that?
Look at you. I've never seen you this enthusiastic for me.
I told you before. Stay away from my beloved!
Only a peck on the cheek and he is now your beloved?
You stalked me?
I just want to know more about him.
Trang, he doesn't deserve you.
Deserve or not, I'll decide for myself.
You keep being like that. Then don't ask me to leave him alone.
Hoang.
Even if it's not Khoa, I'm not gonna get back with you.
I want to know everything about Khoa.
I lost to him, and Trang is mad at me. I'm such a failure, Long.
-Oh you wanted to win over him? -No, I…
60, 61, 62, 63…
65, 66, 67…
It's okay, she was just worried about you.
Tired?
No…
Not a big deal. I've got six packs now.
Good, 20 rounds more for set two, so you can get even eight packs.
Witty.
Hey, why did you step here?
I have something to tell you.
I can't join the inter-school competition this time.
-What, Long? -What are you saying?
Long, how can we win over Hoang's team without you?
Is it because of your shoulder?
I think you should rest for a few days to see how your shoulder will be.
I'm really not ready for this competition.
I considered carefully,
Tri and A Lu are the best two among us,
along with Khoa, they will go this time.
I believe Khoa is ready.
Anh Khoa… Anh Khoa… Anh Khoa.
We'll try hard together.
Okay.
What do you think, Tri?
We always trust you.
Khoa.
I'll try my best to help our club win.
Cố lên!
Hold your stance still.
Left fist.
Left elbow.
Left knee.
Do those three, each 1000 times.
Huh? That means 3000 times?
What? Do you want to win?
-Even 6000 is okay. -Good.
Use your left even when cleaning or doing anything!
Even when eating and masturbating?
No, you have to use your right then.
Why?
The left to click the mouse.
Click the mouse?
You talkative bastards, get out!
Why did you hit him so hard?
Now you lost the chance to compete with him.
He was so wrong to let that kid replace him though. He wants to embarrass you.
-Even more fun -What?
2997..2998…
2999… 3000
This is Bui Thi Xuan's Song Phuong Kiem, right?
Not bad.
Leave that for me
I'm not gonna go easy on a younger guy.
You're not easy on older guys like me either.
I like you already!
Don't worry. My girl, my girl
2997… 2998…
2999… 3000
What are you doing?
Go home.
If you keep avoiding me, I'm gonna scream.
Ah, pervert, rapist.
Up, go go!
Are you insane? My parents are gonna kill me!
What happened?
Nothing, I'm watching a horror movie.
Turn down the volume, it's late now.
Okay.
You’re so good at imitating me. I didn't know you were that stubborn.
Because I wanted to see you.
For?
Ah… see you to thank you.
I know that treatment gel was yours.
Well… There are many guys in the club,
maybe it was from Alex.
But… it was the same brand as the one Long used.
Homemade gel has no brand though…
Okay… you already thanked me, now go home…
Umm, sorry about the other day!
Umm, you said sorry,
now go home.
Hoang tried to.
So he provoked me the other day, who could stand that?
So you started to hit him for being provoked?
I know it's my fault!
What?
I miss that kiss.
Miss that kiss…
Why is it so noisy?
It was hot so I went for some air.
-Be careful though. -Yes.
Okay. Go to sleep soon, mom!
Keep making mistakes Because you're allowed to
Keep loving although we're silly
A Lu's Ngoc Trang Ngan Dai is a Vietnamese Martial Arts movement.
It contains all the basic things
It contains all the basic things of traditional martial arts.
So I decided to let Khoa compete with Tri today.
Why is that?
Why do they compete with each other but you tell me to warm up?
Don't be mad. Back to your seat.
I'm not mad.
It's like I'm here for your entertainment.
These guys are so special. Sit here then.
Khoa and Tri come here.
Interesting!
Start!
Huh? Why does it look like my Song Phuong Kiem?
He stole my Ngoc Trang Quyen already.
Tri's weakness is that he follows the movements,
but Miu Quyen is very flexible.
Wild cats are not easy to bully.
You guys were great.
I know you love Hung Ke Quyen. So do you know why it is powerful?
Yeah, Hung Ke Quyen attacks from every direction, 3-4 strikes at 1 point.
My dad was very passionate about this.
Come here.
Hung Ke Quyen was invented by Nguyen Lu, king of Eastern Conquering.
And was put into training for Tay Son soldiers at that time.
It's deadly
and is one of the quintessential martial arts in Binh Dinh.
However, Vietnamese Martial Arts always praise sportsmanship and encourage people to stop in-time.
That is the spirit of Vietnamese people that I need to promote.
Try your best!
Hey, are you thinking about some girl?
No, the competition is tomorrow. I'm just worried.
Don't worry…
Now you're even better than me!
I like your Hung Ke Quyen!
To be honest,
every time talking about Hung Ke Quyen,
I miss my dad.
He lost a match.
His pneumonia then got serious and he passed away.
Since then my mom banned me from learning martial arts.
Just try your best tomorrow. Don't overthink!
Hello my loves,
I'm at the inter school competition now.
I'm very excited.
You know why? See?
It's very crowded here.
Now we're gonna interview some people
Now we're gonna interview some people to know what they're thinking.
Come on.
Hi,
Hi, how do you feel now?
-Ah, I think… -Okay okay.
Oh my gosh, they are very touched and speechless right now.
Oh my god, see? It's very exciting here.
Khoa!
Fighting!
I know you're very excited,
but you have to stay calm and focused.
Safety first, okay?
-Yeah. -Okay, warm up now.
Ladies and gentlemen, and The Inter School Competition.
Starts… now…
Lu…
Are you okay?
Not only ugly, but also useless.
-I was hit, not useless. -Sit up.
Oh, I'm dizzy from the hit.
Are you guys ready?
And the first round
of the Inter School Competition starts now.
Ba Cuong is eliminated because of his unsportsmanlike conduct.
Duc Tri won.
-Stay away. -Yes.
-Get the splint. -Yes.
Stop, why do you keep beating after the whistle is blown?
Sorry.
What do you hit like?
You guys collude with each other right?
What are you saying?
Don't defame other people.
What are you saying?
All clubs please stay calm.
If any has rowdy conduct, the candidates will be disqualified.
Hear that?
You want to be eliminated? Go back.
-Who got hit? -No, no one
This one got hit. I thought it was painful so I just screamed.
Sorry, I let you down.
They were unsporting to Tri
to give them the advantage to win.
You can do it, right?
VIETNAMESE MARTIAL ARTS - THE CHAMPION
Only knew you for a while and you surprised me so many times, Khoa.
What do you want?
Turns out your dad is Tran Anh Phong.
That's none of your business.
Is it?
Notice that man?
Is he the one who beat your dad?
My dad has come here to see your Hung Ke Quyen.
And now is the first semi-final
between Tran Anh Khoa from Vietnamese Martial Arts club
and Cao Chan from the DC MMA club.
Is this your Hung Ke Quyen?
Is this your Hung Ke Quyen?
Even his dad lost, so he'll lose too.
-My dad didn't lose. -He died, so he lost.
My dad didn't lose, my dad didn't lose.
Khoa. Stand up, stay focused.
Stand up! Stand up!
Khoa!
My dad didn't lose!
My dad didn't lose!
My dad didn't lose!
Khoa.
Khoa, Stop. What are you doing?
Khoa!
Khoa, are you out of your mind?
Violating the rules of the tournament, Anh Khoa is eliminated.
Khoa.
-Khoa, what's happened? -Let me go, don't follow me.
Khoa.
Khoa.
What do you want?
I don't want you to repeat my mistake.
So you're regretting it now after killing people?
If I were the murderer, you were the partner in crime then.
If you hadn't distracted him,
I was beaten.
I couldn't accept my failure back then.
I lost my control.
I've been haunted by that all these years.
I lost my control and my sportsmanship.
And I believe, teacher Phong wouldn't want you to repeat that.
I won't fight, I won't fight anymore.
I won't allow you to learn martial arts, got it?
Okay.
Thank you.
Sorry.
This time I won faster than expected.
This is not the proper way to win.
Winning is too easy for me.
You knew from the start this cup would be mine.
One day,
your competitiveness will kill you like me.
You can lose,
but I can't.
Why?
Why are you here?
Want my congratulations?
Trang, that guy doesn't deserve you.
You're gloating right?
I didn't do anything?
He lost by himself.
He couldn't stand the pressure and had to go back to his place.
But it was just a game, Khoa isn't that kind of person.
Not that kind of person?
He lost control when seeing my dad.
He's still mad at my dad for winning over his dad.
How do you know that?
I told you I'll know what I want to know.
So you invited your dad there on purpose.
You tripped Tri and then Khoa.
Now you're going back to your mean self.
Don't you see the gap between me and him?
I do.
You'll do anything just to be number one,
I'm always number two.
Khoa is different.
You would trade anything just to be number one,
I'm always number two.
This is not the proper way to win.
Those who seek the peak of a fight
Those who seek the peak of a fight ‎Should know the depth of martial arts
-Mom, I… -I know everything.
Sorry.
No, it's okay.
I'm a disgraceful son.
Dad died because of me.
What are you talking about, Khoa?
Cao Hung told me everything.
Cao Hung?
I'm also sorry about this.
I'll fund Khoa to finish college.
I hope I can help you a bit.
I hope you won't reject this for his good.
Think about that,
if your dad hit him hard and caused any trouble,
his son would hate our family forever.
This is much better, right?
Khoa, if your dad didn't hurt anyone for your sake,
we have to be happy about that. Right?
-But… -I know,
I left the feather duster inside.
Go burn incense sticks for your dad.
Okay.
You, come here too.
Dad, you taught me martial arts to build my body,
but I wasn't strong enough.
I don't deserve to be your son.
You heard him.
Now I will punish him on your behalf.
You'll have to eat four bowls of rice.
-Don't say no -Okay!
So… Tai!
I think it's my fault too.
So please punish me by eating 6 bowls!
Okay.
What are you doing there?
Give me a hand!
Yes!
Miss your dad?
Yeah, I miss him practicing martial arts, doing Hung Ke Quyen.
Your dad is respected not only for his mastery, but also his manner.
That's what made me fall for him too.
We still have one final.
This is the Bau Da wine I made.
I plan to save that for Khoa's wedding.
Ah, then keep it, it's no occasion today.
Yes, you're having a match tomorrow, so drink some to get energy.
Didn't you hear that?
You should go to the match tomorrow.
Huh? Didn't you ban him from martial arts?
If you don't have any other thoughts but martial arts,
then competing to see where you are is good.
I got it. Thanks, mom.
Drink.
Know your limits, son.
I know, don't worry.
-Khoa, where are you going? -Brother Long.
Long,
sorry for bothering you guys.
We all know everything.
Long and I came here to cheer for you.
Try your best.
Long, I'll go alone this time!
Okay, I understand.
Trang,
I'm sorry.
I was angry back then.
Be careful.
I'll do my best.
You'd better do it.
You lost your right arm, stop.
This is enough.
You have quick reactions and raw talent with sharp techniques.
But when you meet the strong opponents,
you'll die not holding your stance still.
Left elbow…
and left knee.
Vietnamese martial arts are like Vietnamese people.
The stronger opponents we face, the stronger we get.
-Nice move. -You too.
You can compete with me again anytime.
Yeah!
Yeah, excellent! you're brilliant Khoa.
To be honest, I was very worried,
so I kept this wrench to use if something happened.
But it's unnecessary now.
You're so great.
-Are you okay? -I'm alright.
Mom, Long.
Good job, kiddo.
Hoang, you did well too.
I'll let you know, don't be so arrogant.
We'll know who's better at 5 p.m.
We can even wait till dusk.
Then wait here, I'm gonna go home.
Nonsense,
we're talking about Hoang and Khoa. What are you saying? 5 p.m. what?
I thought it was about the lottery.
Hey look who came.
Oh my darling is back.
It's been a while.
Oh, my darling is here…
Why do you look so gross now? Oh, blood…
Everyone, blood…
It's okay, as long as you came back. But you must have lost by the look of it.
Don't be so rude.
You're so rude.
Then who's the winner?
Here.
Draw.
No no, I don't accept that.
I'm very competitive. We have to win. But don't be disappointed though.
What? What?
-Ah, we just accidentally held hands. -Accidentally…
Accidentally, accidentally…
So accidentally, holding hands. You're in love, right?
Don't deny it. There's nothing to be shy about, just confirm it.
Oh, they love each other.
The girl is older though.
What do you mean? You mean I'm old?
No no you got it wrong.
I said you're like his sister, backing up for him when he falls.
I'm here now. Everything's okay.
Take your medicine honey.
If only… I could help stop your nightmares.
The nightmares are getting worse.
Honey.
Why don't you… take a day off tomorrow?
I can't do that, honey.
Tomorrow is an important day.
I know.
But the most important thing right now is your health.
I'm alright. Don't worry honey.
Then you should try to get some rest.
Test the projector in the conference room.
Honey. I put extra sugar in there for you today.
Yes, I'm here.
Also prepare some tea and cookies, okay?
Oh really?
Alright, thank you.
I already took Peppy for a walk this morning.
Did you decide on what to wear tonight yet?
Tonight?
It's my company party.
But if you're tired… It's ok if you don't go.
No it's not. It's my husband's party.
I'm off to work.
No need to be scared.
It's just me, not a ghost.
Phuong Anh.
The meds I gave you had no effect at all?
I've tried everything.
But a lot of times…
The nightmares… are so real.
Sounds scary.
If I was you, I wouldn't sleep at all.
If only… a dreamy man would chase me everyday.
Phuong Anh! Vy!
What is it?
-You two haven't heard the news? -What news?
Gosh!
-The operation is in an hour. -We know.
Yeah,stop being cranky. "He" is here to observe us again.
Is it "him"?
Who else but the Director of the Hospital?
Oh, I'm dead meat. I get the shakes every time I see him.
He's just a man, not a ghost.
Why are you so scared?
Excuse me.
20 blade
Vy, 20 blade.
Hemorrhage!
Suction!
Phuong Anh!
What's up?
Tell me the truth, is something wrong?
You're acting very strange.
No, nothing's wrong.
Look! Listen to me.
I'm not a professional,
but I've researched cases of sleepwalking and nightmares like yours.
The thing is, meds don't really help much in these cases.
But more than 70% of these cases can be treated with cognitive therapy.
Phuong Anh.
Thanks for today.
If it weren't for you, I'd be a goner.
It was nothing.
Phuong Anh. I'd also like to thank you very much.
I'll go back to my room first. Bye.
Bye.
Here she is.
I'd like to introduce you to Doctor Phuong Anh.
Head of the children's ward of our hospital.
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
You're so accomplished at a very young age.
How can she not be? She's Doctor Huynh Minh Tuong's daughter.
She is the youngest surgeon we have here.
How old are you?
-I'm-- -Old enough. Talented enough.
Dedicated enough for us to believe that she can handle this project.
You can rest assured.
-Thank you. -Well then…
I'll leave you two alone.
The center has a total of 300 hospital beds,
25 specialists, and 60 nurses.
We're expected to meet the…
Sir, if I'm speaking too fast for you to follow,
please let me know.
No, it's not that. Your presentation is excellent.
You can… come sit by me.
So that it is easier to talk.
But I still have a lot to cover--
Listen to me. Come over here.
Relax.
Sorry, sir, perhaps I was too rushed.
-I was going too fast, wasn't I? -No.
Your presentation was very clear.
I feel that… This children's center project is stellar.
I'll support it 100%. Don't you worry.
I'm so glad to hear you say that. Thank you so much!
I can see that you're really passionate about this project.
Very. I believe this it is an important project for the community,
but it still lacks funding.
That's why for this project,
-I'd like us to-- -Hold on. That's enough.
I have a suggestion.
Let's find some place… Say, at my place.
And what ever you've got planned, I'll listen.
How does that sound?
What do you mean, sir?
What I mean is…
It's so stuffy in here.
We should go some place more spacious.
And besides… this project is worth a billion dong.
I need to feel confident that I'm handing it to someone…
Who understands me the most.
What happened, Phuong Anh?
Why does Mr. Tri want you fired?
You need to tell me, so I can help you.
Will the children's center be alright?
Luckily.
But… He wants you to see a psychiatrist.
But I don't have any mental problems.
He's doing this to punish you.
You don't need to see any doctor.
This problem with Mr. Tri… Just let me handle it.
This matter aside, if you need anything else,
then just let me know, Phuong Anh.
Just relax and go back to your work.
Sir.
Actually…
I think I should see a psychiatrist.
Mr. Trong, what can I do for you?
You can't hide for the rest of your life.
I'm sorry. I didn't know that you've been trying to contact me.
You'd like that!
I still have my life.
You want to take that too? Huh!
Trong, please calm down. Just calm down.
Today is my daughter's birthday.
She would've started first grade this year!
Do you have kids?
I'm sorry.
I tried my best to save Mai.
I only had one daughter.
And she died under your care. I won't let you off that easy!
Do you think it was Trong?
That was so long ago.
How can he still hold a grudge against you?
His only child died on my operating table.
Even though it wasn't my fault, he still can't forgive me.
You did all you could. Life and death are fated.
Let's get going.
The man of the hour can't be late.
Let's toast to the man of the hour, and toast to the billion-dong deal he closed!
Thank you!
Please come. Congratulations!
Thank you! Thanks, everyone!
Let's all toast to him!
Here's to you!
Let's give a big round of applause for Dr. Huynh Phuong Anh.
Sir, are you okay?
That young woman is My Linh.
She's only been at the company two months,
but she's already the top seller for those two months.
Impressive.
With a body like that, you can ask for anything.
But… Honestly speaking, My Linh stands no hope compared to you!
Yeah, and you are hopeless!
Did you have to be so direct?
If you had accepted my proposal,
then you would never have these nightmare problems.
I should get going now.
What… What road are you taking?
What are you doing?
I can't tell what's real and what's a dream anymore.
Truth is… I shouldn't have let you go home alone.
You're just getting home now?
We went to a bar.
My boss got too drunk. I had to take him home.
Tomorrow… I'll drive you to work.
I won't take no for an answer.
I can't even remember how I got into the house.
It's like reality and nightmares…
are blended together.
It sounds incredibly confusing.
This is such a coincidence.
I should tell you about this story.
The other night, after a birthday party
I tried to get a taxi, just like you did.
When I got into the car, the driver turned to me with a freezing cold stare.
He asked me one question. "Where are you going?"
So I told him to drive me home.
But he didn't seem happy with my answer.
So he asked me another question.
"Where do you live?"
You're crazy!
You're so lame.
Can't you see Phuong Anh is going through something?
I was sharing a real story that happened to me.
Honey. I think that's Mr. Trong.
I have to teach him a lesson!
-Please, don't! -Hold this for me. Let me handle it.
Get out.
What do you want?
I'm so sorry. I got the wrong person.
What the hell are you doing?
-You got the wrong person? -Yes.
-You like grabbing people's shirts? -Please.
I can mess with you too. You like that?
No. I don't.
You wanna come at me?
You'd better watch your back.
Just tell me what you're thinking!
I have nothing to say. No thoughts at all.
Truth is, there's nothing to discuss.
From Mr. Trong to the car, you think that I'm making it all up, don't you?
Why would I do that?
So you will buy me a new car?
You say you don't think so, but your attitude says differently.
Now that you have told me about the nightmares,
Let's talk about why you think Mr. Trong wanted to attack you?
Her name was Mai.
She was transferred here in terrible condition.
I…
I tried everything I could.
Even now, I can't get over it.
When a patient doesn't make it,
that pain will always stay with you.
I've talked a lot today.
Thank you.
I got you!
I got you good, right? You should have seen your face!
Oh, hey now!
Hey
Should we call a tow truck?
I can fix it. Let me.
Mr. Trong.
Yeah, this looks serious.
Why is he driving a different car?
It's all good now.
-Thanks, Golden Hands. -No problem.
Oh my dear Khoa.
-Miss, are you alright? -Are you alright?
A guy in that alley attacked me!
Calm down. Stay here.
There's nothing here!
Hello?
Sorry about that.
Let's go, honey. Sorry.
There's a guy following me.
He's also trying to recreate my nightmares.
About the attacker without a face… I've been researching other cases.
It's a reflection of fears, of trauma, a secret that the patient dares not talk about.
a secret that the patient dares not talk about.
Their subconscious tries to stop them.
by making them forget,
or they will manifest images
to help them feel more at ease.
Miss Phuong Anh, is there a fear that you need to confront?
I don't really know.
Phuong Anh. Someone sent these flowers for you.
Thank you.
"Meet me at Zumwhere at noon."
Are you here yet?
I've been waiting for you a long time.
Oh, did we have a date?
How come I don't recall anything?
Well, you sent flowers and asked me to lunch.
What flowers? I've been in a meeting all day.
Phuong Anh.
Phuong Anh?
Phuong Anh.
Where are you? Hello?
Hello? Phuong Anh!
Please say something! Hello?
The flowers you like are really hard to find.
Why are you doing this? What do you want?
You know it.
Babe!
-Have you been waiting long? -I just got here.
Is anyone in there?
Why did you attack me? Who are you?
Me? I didn't attack you!
I'm just a server here.
Server?! The person who left the toilet was wearing black shoes like yours!
Black shoes?
They're part of our uniform. Everyone wears them!
There's no doubt.
Someone is doing this on purpose to hurt me.
Who would do this to you? And why?
Honey.
Lately, we haven't been spending enough time together.
Ever since I got a promotion, I've been buried in projects.
If I've done anything wrong, then tell me directlly.
-What are you driving at? -You know it.
From the nightmares to the threatening phone calls,
and then the restaurant incident…
You think I did all this myself, that I made it all up?
I'm really trying to understand everything you've been telling me.
Can we… go back to the way things were?
Remember when we used to invite our friends over for dinner?
Phuong Anh!
I just got your text.
What's going on this weekend?
Come over for dinner. You, me and Minh.
Three of us, as usual.
But what's the occasion?
No occasion.
We haven't gotten together for so long.
Also, why do we need a reason to share a meal?
Okay.
Ah, when you come over, there's going to be a surprise gift for you.
A surprise?
Tonight's dish looks delicious!
Do you want a knuckle sandwich?
Why so fierce? I'll eat what you offer.
Is that Vy? Come on in!
Your gift is a surprise!
Phuong Anh, you are truly an ideal housewife!
You're so talented, making all these dishes.
Look at this beef! So tender and tasty!
By the way, how's your sleep lately?
Are you still having nightmares?
Let's change the subject.
But I want to know what's going on.
Phuong Anh said a creepy psycho is stalking her.
Wow. Creepy!
Hey, this sounds interesting.
Do you know who he is?
Why didn't you tell me?
It's just like in her nightmares.
-Really? -That's enough.
No it's not. We need to get to the bottom of this!
She thinks it's the same person. Happy now?
Huh?
So what you're saying is…
Phuong Anh is….
Why aren't you saying anything?
You think so too, don't you?
Phuong Anh. Minh didn't say anything.
Not only him, but everyone here thinks I have mental problems, right?
Tonight was so fun.
Who knows when we can have a night like this again.
You think they'd invite you back?
Hey, hey, hey. This is Minh's fault.
He's treating her so badly. All this mess is his doing.
What're you saying?
Minh loves her so much.
It's because you don't know. Let me tell you something…
Phuong Anh's family is loaded.
She inherited a huge fortune from her father.
Did you know that?
Are jealous of their happiness?
There's nothing to be jealous of.
There. Your car is here.
Why don't you cancel yours and we can share this ride?
-Want some of this? -Why you gotta be like that?
Peppy.
Peppy!
Peppy!
Peppy!
Peppy!
Peppy.
Peppy?
Peppy!
Minh!
Peppy…
Peppy?
Hey Peppy.
Peppy!
Peppy!
Phuong Anh.
-Did I wake you? -It's okay.
You should go back to sleep.
You have a business trip tomorrow.
How about I cancel it tomorrow?
I can't leave you home alone like this.
I'm okay.
No need to worry about me. It's only for one night.
Vy. Do you have plans this weekend?
My guy Thien just called.
He already made plans for us.
This weekend, we're going to Vung Tau.
I'm so excited!
In that case, you two have fun.
What's wrong? Did something happen?
I wanted to ask you to come hang out while Minh's away.
Then why don't you go to Vung Tau with us?
Down there, we're going to party hard!
Just text me where and when to meet.
Don't be wishy-washy!
I'm not that unreasonable. Don't wanna be a third wheel.
I respect your privacy.
Coming through! Outta the way.
If you get burned, then it's on you!
Wait, wait, wait a second.
Milk tea, 50% ice, 30% sugar. No topping.
Thank you sweet gentleman.
Hey, are you free this weekend?
Come cheer our sister up!
No thanks, I'm swamped! Swamped!
You two… Weirdos.
Exhausting.
That's my Thien calling.
"That's my Thien calling."
Gross.
Phuong Anh.
If you ever need anything… Just call me.
24/7. Anytime. Okay?
Don't be shy.
Oh?
Why did you just say you were swamped with work?
Well… the work I'm swamped with… is you.
Nonsense. I told you, I'm alright.
You don't have to act tough in front of me.
I know that lately you've had to deal with a lot.
I just want to be by your side.
As a friend.
Have a good weekend. I'm heading home.
Ah, Phuong Anh.
I almost missed the chance to give you the invite for our end-of-the-year party.
Here. To my most excellent doctor.
Hello?
Phuong Anh.
Who is this?
You know…
Who are you?
Who? Me?
You didn't save my number?
I'm so bummed.
Open the door for me Phuong Anh.
I'm the guy you almost married…
But you treat me like this?
Thai? What are you babbling about?
I know what you're thinking right now.
Truth is you love me too, right?
You love me, so why pretend to set me up with other girls?
If you want something, the two of us--
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
Is that you Thai?
I told you to go home!
Thai?
You've gone too far!
Go home!
Thai, I'm telling you one last time.
If you keep doing this, I'll call security.
Hello miss, I'm calling from the credit bureau.
Would you like to take out a loan?
I'm calling security!
I'm coming in. Better get ready.
Come here! I dare you!
I've checked the fuse box.
You just blew a fuse.
You two. Come inside and see this.
Hurry!
I've analyzed the scene. There are at least 4 to 5 burglars!
It was me. I threw the dishes at the attacker.
You two follow me in here.
There's nothing wrong here.
He broke into this room.
But the door is locked.
And there's no sign of forced entry. Who could come in?
But I know he chased me around here.
I even fell and bruised my knee.
-Such a coward! -If you're so brave then open the door!
We have to. We're the security.
Fine. Whoever ever it is, we'll take him down!
Yep!
Phuong Anh--
You… Why you…
So so sorry. I didn't mean to.
When you're done eating, you can crash on the sofa.
You should try to get some sleep, too.
I'm probably going to stay up all night.
I can't possibly sleep now.
Did you just wake up? Are you feeling better?
Oh…This just happened this morning.
It's just a small wound. It's nothing.
You should go home.
How can I do that? You're home alone.
Forget it. I'll leave tomorrow morning.
Minh just called…
He told me that he's already on the way home.
Thank you.
You can go home.
Really?
Here Peppy.
Peppy!
Here Peppy!
Phuong Anh!
Hey Phuong Anh!
What happened?
Peppy is lost?
Since when, honey?
Since this morning.
I've searched the whole neighborhood but I can't find him anywhere.
Honey, I know for sure someone took Peppy.
Honey… It's probably not that.
He's probably somewhere around here.
Our neighborhood is very safe.
You weren't home. How would you know?
I've been calling you since last night and you haven't picked up.
My phone ran out of battery.
Phuong Anh!
My Dad gave Peppy to me.
He was the weakest of the litter.
Dad told me… that I had to take care of him.
For the past ten years…
he has been my only friend.
Can you talk a bit more about your father?
You've been avoiding this subject for a long time.
He was the one who started the Children's Center project.
He put all his time and energy into that project.
He didn't have time… not even to spend with me.
At the time it was happening…
I felt… I was very furious.
And now?
In your heart…
How do you feel about him?
I miss him so much.
Every time I think of him,
I feel very… conflicted.
Because I know that he suffered from depression.
Phuong Anh! Hey.
About last night…
Before you left, did you see Peppy anywhere?
He's still at your house.
Why, what's up?
Hey…
Hey!
What's wrong with you?
Honey… Why are you sitting out here?
What happened?
Peppy was killed.
Peppy's dead.
Sir… Do you have any updates?
We're very sorry.
Peppy's safe and sound!
Peppy…
I feel unsure about everything now.
Doctor Dung.
Do you think…
everything is because of me?
Am I crazy?
I've gone crazy, right?
Phuong Anh.
Is there anything…
You haven't told me?
‎Phuong Anh.
There's still something else that happened to you, right?
It must have been something very painful.
That's why your subconscious intentionally erased it.
Or maybe you blamed yourself for whatever happened.
It's okay…
We still have many chances.
Even though you have cast that memory aside,
it's still there.
You must try to remember.
Missing dog.
If you are still afraid to confront your past pain,
regardless how many therapy sessions you have, they won't work.
Your nightmares will continue to haunt you…
even when you are awake.
Why are you sitting here?
Who were you talking to?
It was just a business call.
Those new contracts I just signed.
Who exactly was it?
It was Thai, who else?
Give me the phone.
Phuong Anh. You're overstepping.
Where do you think I went?
Phuong Anh!
Do whatever you want. I'm done talking.
You set up everything, didn't you?
Set up what?
The night you pretended to be on a work trip.
It was you who attacked me.
You're the only one with a house key.
And then the night at the movies.
It's always "my phone ran out of batteries"
or "I left my phone at the office".
Can't you come up with a better excuse?
You're imagining things.
-Imagining things? -Exactly.
I have proof!
That other poor dog was killed.
I saw its corpse in the fridge with my own eyes.
Today I went to the dogowner's house to confirm the story.
I can't believe you would do something so barbaric.
You came up with the perfect plan.
You made everyone think your wife was hallucinating!
Phuong Anh!
What the hell are you talking about?
Why would I do any of this?
So that everyone will think that I'm going mental.
And what would I gain from doing that?
Money.
From my father's fortune.
Or for your girlfriend.
What do you want me to do now?
Do you want me to kneel down and beg for forgiveness?
You're right.
I am a terrible husband.
But since you became the director of the new center,
all you care about is work!
When we found out you were pregnant, do you know how happy I was?
I thought it was a chance… for us to start over.
But then the miscarriage happened.
And that ended everything.
Do you know what I thought?
You never wanted that baby.
Thai!
Thai!
I'm sorry. I was so drunk the other night.
Please forgive me.
Let's move past that.
Have you seen Minh in the last few days?
Minh?
Come to think of it, I haven't seen him lately.
Nonsense! There's no way that's true.
My Linh is having an affair with the boss, not with Minh.
-How can you be so sure? -Oh come on!
Because everyone knows the drama.
Just the other day, his wife came to the office and caused a ruckus.
Let me tell you.
Once he and My Linh were coming back from breakfast, all cozy and confident.
The wife jumps out from behind the gate, grabbed her hair and started punching her!
She had just thrown a punch when he jumped in to break it up and bam!
Took three lumps in the throat!
One, two, three
That's not all!
After that she was sure he would dump My Linh, but no.
He dumped the wife and went back to My Linh.
Are you done?
That's the end of it, yeah.
Two days ago, around 10PM, did you call Minh?
Yes. I did call him that night.
Minh just got back and landed a sweet deal.
I called him to quickly lock down the contract.
So he really was on a work trip?
Phuong Anh!
What're you mumbling about?
Miss Phuong Anh has mental problems.
That's probably why she comes to see you.
Phuong Anh.
Trong is also just a patient of mine.
I've never disclosed anything you shared with me to anyone.
Believe me. It's not like you think.
Hey Khoa!
This guy.
Khoa?
Phuong Anh…
Khoa!
Hang in there, you hear me? Hang in there!
Hang on.
Vy! Vy, come help me! Khoa's been hurt. Vy!
That's gonna be difficult.
The patient has lost a lot of blood.
Let me handle it.
I will take care of both of you neatly.
Vy.
What's happening, Vy?
What do you think?
Thien…
Minh is my "Thien."
I've loved him ever since we were in school.
You were the one who broke us up.
He didn't like that we became close.
But that was the only way for me to be close to him.
It's all your fault!
The nightmares feel so real.
You didn't deserve him.
He deserves to be with someone who loves him more than a stupid dog.
Are you crazy, Vy?
-Have you gone crazy? -No… I'm not crazy.
I just know what I need to do to get him back.
You have to die!
Run, Phuong Anh!
Khoa, stay awake!
Khoa…
Vy! What the hell are you doing?
Phuong Anh.
My god. What has happened here?
Vy…
What the hell have you done, Vy?
-Let me help you. -Get away from me!
She deserves this. She deserves to die!
Don't do this.
Vy… Calm down. Pull yourself together.
Phuong Anh. She is delusional.
You're the only one I ever loved!
I am not delusional! Thien, don't leave me.
Shut up!
Don't ever call me by that name!
We are just friends. You have to let go of the past!
Vy… Stop trying to find ways to break up my marriage.
Please.
What do you mean, Thien?
Thien… Don't leave me.
I'm so scared.
-Thien. -I'm sorry.
Thien!
Vy! Hold on tight!
Hold tight…
Now everyone can get a good night's sleep.
Don't!
No!
Everyone give a round applause to Dr. Huynh Phuong Anh,
Director of the Children's Center!
Phuong Anh.
-Congratulations. -Thank you.
Give it up for Dr. Huynh Phuong Anh, the youngest Chief of Surgery!
Thank you, everyone, for your generous support.
Sir!
Congratulations!
Sir, are you alright?
Let me take you to bandage that up.
Isn't she going to give a speech?
Where is she going?
Do you still remember
I used to visit your house often?
Every time I'd bring you so many toys.
You were so shy, so your father had to accept it for you.
Here, let me.
Sir. What are you doing?
You… never thanked me.
Just stand still.
-I'm not going to bite you. -I have to get going.
Sir! What're you doing?
I've been supporting you.
Ever since you were little I've been so good to you.
Why haven't you ever shown gratitude?
After you raped me…
You carried me to the emergency room.
You even told everyone… that I had been attacked in the garage.
While it was you,
who battered me.
and kept me bedridden for days.
It was the perfect opportunity…
for you to fill me with tranquillizers…
to blur my memory.
That cocktail of drugs…
No one ever suspected,
because they were personally prescribed by the head of the hospital.
It went on like this, for days… and weeks…
I continued to be drugged.
While you reminded me daily,
how fortunate it was that I survived,
after the vicious attack in the garage.
Your plan was going so perfectly
until the day… I stopped taking the drugs.
What are you trying to do?
I want everyone to know your true face.
and all of the horrifying things you have done to me.
so that you will never do it to anyone else.
Let's see what you can do to me.
Who will believe you?
Will they believe a respectful chief with a good reputation,
whom all these years, have never made a single mistake?
Or will they believe a young girl who is being treated for mental illness?
Her father even went crazy, and committed suicide.
Looks like everything has come full circle.
Father and daughter… are both stubborn alike.
This chair…
your father could not win it from me.
Who the hell are you?
Don't ever use my assault on you to threaten me.
If you ever speak out about it,
you will be the one who gets shamed.
If you know what's good for you,
Looking for Paradise.
It's a short, five-minute film that was made by a student.
Back then, Director Bong was not the Director Bong he is now.
When did you watch that film?
Well, in terms of the life span of Yellow Door,
I'd say it was either the beginning or the middle, not the latter years.
One day, Director Bong…
Back then, we just called him Joon Ho.
He said he got some money after working as a tutor.
I think he had worked for a month or two.
Anyway, he bought a camera with that money
and made a film using his living room as the backdrop.
It was about a caterpillar looking for its paradise.
He made this tiny little caterpillar.
And since it was a stop-motion animation, he had to move it one cut at a time.
At the end, the caterpillar fights a stuffed monkey in the living room.
And eventually, it continues its journey to paradise.
It was incredible. I was in shock. I was so amazed by it back then.
He didn't seem like the Joon Ho I knew.
The film was about five minutes long.
It was 23 minutes.
And you got the protagonist and the villain mixed up.
I got them mixed up? VILLAIN - PROTAGONIST
-Wasn't the caterpillar the protagonist? -It was the gorilla.
I thought it was the caterpillar.
Oh, it was the gorilla?
I see.
I found this wooden box after a really long time.
About 20 years or so.
I used to store a lot of stuff in here.
And here's something I found.
Oh, 8 mm films?
These are the 8 mm films from our Yellow Door workshop.
These are…
-Wow! -I have all of them here.
-This many. -Look at that!
I got all kinds of stuff here. I don't quite remember what we did.
We filmed all kinds of nonsense.
I hope these will help us through this Rashomon situation.
They are all here.
You still have the gorilla, right?
Yes, the gorilla.
I do have it, but…
Let's just say it's gone.
It's embarrassing, you know.
"I'm reminded of my hidden debut film, which I've never mentioned anywhere else."
"Before I made my self-proclaimed first short film, White Man,
"Before I made my self-proclaimed first short film, White Man, I once made a short animated film entitled Looking for Paradise."
I once made a short animated film entitled Looking for Paradise."
I interviewed Director Bong Joon Ho while writing The Debut.
He spoke as if he was a spy sharing a secret.
He glanced left and right as he said, "Actually, I once made this other film."
So I thought, "I should leave this out. I guess I won't be able to use this."
But the story was so interesting.
"I invited 20 or so people to the Yellow Door Christmas party
and had my very first movie premiere with a completely flushed face."
"The only people on Earth who have seen that movie
are the people who were there that day."
Jong-tae, can you hear me?
Hey. Hi!
Can you see me?
Yes, I can see you.
-You must be busy. -Yes, I guess.
Your film will be released in a few days.
Your film will be released in a few days. Yeah, I've been busier because the production was small.
Yeah, I've been busier because the production was small.
I had to make some things happen.
-It's been so long, Se-bum. -Hey, Ban.
Did you dye your hair? Your hair…
Well, I have to.
It's completely gray unless I dye it.
He looks like a minister today.
You know, like the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport.
-Oh, Byung-hoon. -It's working.
-Oh, Byung-hoon. -It's working. Hey!
Is that Byung-hoon? Man.
Wow, Byung-hoon.
-Can you see us? -Can't he see us?
-I don't think he can. -He can.
-Hey. -Can you hear us?
-I see you. -Okay.
What time is it over there? Is it after midnight?
What time is it over there? Is it after midnight? It's almost eleven o'clock.
11:00 p.m.?
-Yes. -Gosh.
Hey, your Korean has gotten a bit awkward now.
Oh, come on.
Should we do this in English? Byung-hoon, should we?
-Hi. Oh my! -Min-hyang!
-Hi, there! -Hey!
Hi. Hey!
-Oh my. Who are they? -When was this?
Oh my! Look at them.
-Why is it so… -Out of focus.
I couldn't stand this kind of thing back then.
I mean, we were in a film club.
But they're all out of focus.
This is hilarious. Seriously, who took these?
Let's find the culprit.
It wasn't me. I'm in the photo.
I'm in it too.
Wait, I'm not in the photo!
Is that me?
Why did we keep taking photos of gum?
-It must've been a focus test. -It was for a focus test.
We didn't know the basic mechanism of cameras.
So, basic things like exposure, aperture…
Yes, right. Shutter speed, focus, and other things.
Shutter speed, focus, and other things.
It was a workshop for us to become familiar with those things.
It was a workshop for us to become familiar with those things. So these photos are far from art.
It's just a parade of dull photos.
Wasn't this Kim Hye-ja's house?
Yes, it was Ms. Kim's house.
When we looked out the window of our office,
we would see Ms. Kim's garden, you know.
Yes, her front gate as well.
We used to take a lot of pictures in front of that stone wall
because it was so pretty.
Wow, look at Dae-yup's sexy pose.
If I had known there was a club there, I would've looked out a little more often.
All I ever thought at the time was, "They can see my house from upstairs."
So you never know what will happen in life, right?
The most heartwarming memory I have of Joon Ho is this.
After the release of Memories of Murder,
you called me at night. It must've been around 10:00 p.m.
-Yes. -And you said…
"Jong-tae, do you know where I am? I'm in front of Gyeongseo Building."
-That's what you said on the phone. -Right.
I guess you were feeling good about your film's success,
and so you were reminiscing about the rough old days.
Gyeongseo Building. Yes.
This was probably a private house, but now it's changed.
This was probably a private house, but now it's changed. Right.
It's been 30 years.
This was our route to the Yellow Door office.
Yes.
To be honest, it didn't feel like we were doing anything particular at Yellow Door.
it didn't feel like we were doing anything particular at Yellow Door.
It felt like a picnic where we could hang out.
But why were we in the Gyeongseo Building?
Did Jong-tae already have an office there?
Jong-tae was a graduate student at Dongguk University at the time.
He took some time off and rented the office
to start a modeling agency with his friends.
After my first day of grad school, I was really disappointed.
It was supposed to be grad school,
but they didn't teach us much.
I still remember this. There was a 16 mm camera at the school.
It would've been good if they'd taught us how to use it.
But they only showed it to us and said, "This is a 16 mm camera."
-And that was it? -That was it.
Around that time…
Uh… Dong-hoon.
That's when I met Lee Dong-hoon.
I was working part-time
at a bookshop called Today's Books in front of Yonsei University.
Cell phones and pagers didn't exist.
So if you looked at the bulletin board at Today's Books,
there were notes saying where people were and telling others to come.
I asked to be introduced to a film student,
and I was introduced to Choi Jong-tae, a grad student who was taking time off from his film studies.
a grad student who was taking time off from his film studies.
I was asked to teach him about film.
So I just told them to send him over.
It's interesting how it turned out.
I mean, if it were now,
I wouldn't have even considered teaching a stranger about film.
But back then, the universities and the clubs had an innocence about them.
But back then, the universities and the clubs had an innocence about them. So it was a very natural thing.
If no one asked me to teach them about film,
my life would've been very different.
It might've been different in a good sense, or…
Actually, it might've been much better.
I wasn't looking to make anything specific in particular.
But I went anyway and poked around.
Dong-hoon said there was a senior he knew
and asked if he could bring him, so I said yes.
I thought I couldn't suffer alone, so I dragged Director Bong into it.
I've loved movies ever since my elementary and middle school days,
and I wanted to become a director.
I'm not sure why.
Maybe because all I ever did was watch TV. My family never did anything.
We didn't travel. We didn't play sports.
The whole family just watched TV.
There are things that come as a shock when you watch a film without any context.
In elementary school, I watched The Wages of Fear.
And The Bicycle Thieves too.
I had once lost my bicycle as a kid,
so I was overly immersed as I watched it.
I watched it knowing nothing about Vittorio De Sica or neorealism.
I watched it knowing nothing about Vittorio De Sica or neorealism. That's why I was simply shocked.
That's why I was simply shocked.
It was my chance, for the first time ever,
to properly discuss and study film as much as I wanted
and watch them over and over.
I didn't major in film studies. I had never worked on a film set before.
But for the first time, I was able to do something with films.
I sat Bong Joon Ho and Lee Dong-hoon down
and started with Understanding Movies.
That was when books about film first began to come out.
Right. Now there's a whole section of them in the bookstore.
Now there's a whole section of them in the bookstore.
But back then, just the idea of books on film was so unfamiliar.
There was Understanding Movies by Louis D. Giannetti…
Plus, A History of Film by Jack C. Ellis. Only those two.
Plus, A History of Film by Jack C. Ellis. Only those two. -That was it. -And others were…
-That was it. -And others were…
This was when we first began to see convenience stores.
So back then, I…
Can you leave out what he said about convenience stores?
That's so… It totally sounds like…
Were there really no convenience stores then?
There weren't.
Right. We used to drink coffee at places like Doutor.
Right. Doutor. It's not around anymore.
I had to teach them something, but there was nothing I could do.
Back then, Joon Ho had been working as a part-time manager at a study room.
He had a lot of free time.
So I told him to transcribe A History of Film instead of just sitting around.
But I never transcribed A History of Film.
Director Bong would've done it.
I'm sure he transcribed A History of Film.
I didn't do it, but I think he definitely would have.
This is the Rashomon effect.
How could I have transcribed that huge book?
I don't understand. I don't understand it at all.
I may finally lose my faith in the human soul.
Bong, don't you remember?
I read it thoroughly since you told me to, but I never transcribed it.
I remember you showing me your notebook.
-Really? -Yeah, that's how I remember it.
-One second. -How else would I know?
This is the book.
-Right. -A History of Film by Jack C. Ellis.
So you did do it. I remember your notebook.
-I see. -You probably quit after a few pages.
Like the to-infinitive section of an English grammar book.
Yes, the to-infinitive section.
You never get past the first chapter.
That's why all Koreans  know about the to-infinitive.
That was the beginning.
Bong Joon Ho, Choi Jong-tae, and I were there at the beginning, and then…
One day, I was lying around at home,
and suddenly, I was engulfed by this passion to study film.
and suddenly, I was engulfed by this passion to study film. It came out of nowhere. I couldn't sleep from that day on.
It came out of nowhere. I couldn't sleep from that day on.
-Hoon-a was one of the early members. -Right.
I had a friend, a psychology major who loved music as much as I did.
My friend said there was a guy named Bong Joon Ho in sociology who likes films,
so I should give him a call.
"Bong Joon Ho? What a unique name."
"I should memorize it as bonjour." So that's what I did!
When I called him, he told me to come to a place in Hongdae.
Jong-tae, you, me, and Hoon-a.
Jong-tae, you, me, and Hoon-a. Do you remember the first seminar the four of us had?
Do you remember the first seminar the four of us had?
We said we'd each bring a film of our choice.
Jong-tae picked Theo Angelopoulos's Landscape in the Mist.
I picked François Truffaut's…
-That one. -Truffaut played the role of a director.
-Day for Night. -Day for Night!
-What was yours? -I didn't really study back then.
-What was yours? -I didn't really study back then. -I don't remember! -We watched four different films.
-I don't remember! -We watched four different films.
Right. We watched the films we each picked, and then we just talked about them.
We watched the films we each picked, and then we just talked about them.
Yes, we did.
One day, I was walking down Baekyang-ro.
I ran into a friend of mine I often used to bump into.
She was walking down the opposite side of the street.
We started talking about movies. Back then, I was into movies.
I told her I'd been into movies lately, and she said,
"Really? I'm in this film group,
and we're going to watch a Turkish film called Yol.
Do you want to come?"
So I said, "Okay, sure." That's how I came to Yellow Door.
That friend was Lim Hoon-a.
Yes.
Now that she mentions it, I'm starting to remember.
But actually, I had known Min-hyang before then.
The College of Liberal Arts put on a play,
and a very cool student played the role of Jesus
in a play called Jesus of Gold Crown.
I was deeply impressed by it,
and the student who played Jesus was Min-hyang.
At the time, our group didn't even have a structure.
But I remember that we all joined
just because we loved films and wanted to study them.
When I think of Eun-sim, I'm reminded of that day.
She turned up with a male bust that art students use to sketch.
She said, "Let's start sketching now." She suddenly wanted us to draw!
It was so random.
I thought, "Why did she bring that plaster bust here?"
But then, some of us started sketching.
So there were a lot of quirky people in the club.
It was a tiny little space,
It was a tiny little space, and we had a round table there that could fit about seven people.
and we had a round table there that could fit about seven people.
And we would just chat away.
We'd watch a film and chat about whatever we knew,
share things we heard somewhere and our thoughts too.
That was the level we were at.
Jong-tae was our leader, and he had no plans at all.
And we loved that we had no plans or structure.
A band of social misfits, so to speak.
Yes, I give you Choi Jong-tae and Five Kids.
A group of fluid people who got together to share dreams.
I'm not sure why, but people studied film like crazy in the early '90s.
This is what I felt.
Social movements were active back then, yet we felt like we hit a wall.
What with perestroika and glasnost, and the Soviet Union coming down and all.
-That's such a… -Too much?
-That's such a macroscopic analysis. -But then--
There were lots of clubs that got together and studied film.
I'm not exactly sure why.
Well, in my case,
Well, in my case, I jumped in and studied film to find myself.
I jumped in and studied film to find myself.
-To find yourself? -Yes.
-To find yourself? -Yes. I kind of wanted to find something that I liked.
I kind of wanted to find something that I liked.
Back then, we were all about bringing down the dictatorship
and repealing the Constitution.
I think everyone felt despondent after the party was over.
Of course, it's not like I did anything notable.
So we didn't know where to go.
We didn't know what to do with all our energy.
The student movements were already over.
So we came together like a cluster of dust.
To put it nicely, we came together like a ripening grape.
To put it nicely, we came together like a ripening grape. I think that's what happened.
I used to be asked this at foreign film festivals
during the early to mid-2000s.
How did Korean films suddenly…
Get their break?
We had films bursting out in the 2000s, drawing attention at film festivals.
"Where had these directors been until then?"
"What on earth had happened?"
Then I'd bring up Yellow Door.
For example, I'd say,
"We were the first cinephile generation."
"My generation was probably the first to actually study film."
We were the first.
"I think we were the first generation to become filmmakers as cinephiles."
I guess it makes it easier to write articles.
So that's why I told them that we have this generation and so on.
The Night Before Strike, a low-budget 16 mm film
that the government banned from screening… THE NIGHT BEFORE STRIKE BY JANGSANGOT HAWKS PREMIERES NATIONWIDE
THE NIGHT BEFORE STRIKE BY JANGSANGOT HAWKS PREMIERES NATIONWIDE
Jangsangot Hawks were superstars back then.
There were many fans who waited for their films every year.
Youth was another solid team.
After Cinematheque 1895 changed its name to SA/sé,
it became renowned as a private cinematheque with the longest history.
as a private cinematheque with the longest history.
It was as if the cinephiles who had been hiding
were suddenly pouring out onto the streets.
I think that was the crazy situation in the '90s.
This is what I think.
The government must've drugged the water supply back then.
I think it was a nationwide project to turn all citizens into cinephiles.
Compared to these groups, Yellow Door was a mysterious, peculiar…
-Jangsangot Hawks was the Premier League. -Yes.
Jung Ji-woo's Youth was the Bundesliga. We were like…
-An amateur club. -An amateur club compared to them.
I had to pay my tuition for the fourth semester,
and it felt like such a waste!
I realized I could buy a lot of materials for the club
with that money.
I decided to get myself in serious trouble, and so…
I founded a film institute.
Of course, my family had no idea.
Yellow Door was on the second floor of a building in Seogyo-dong at the time.
And it was…
a rectangular building, like this.
There was a corridor in the middle.
And the door to the Yellow Door Institute stood right here.
When you opened the door,
you'd see a round table on the left.
Usually, Joon Ho would be studying there.
In the front, there was a tiny television.
I think we often watched music videos and stuff.
We painted all the furniture yellow.
Didn't Dae-yup paint with us?
From what I recall, you and Jong-tae bought the paint.
They weren't yellow at first,
but you said, "We're going all yellow." Then you painted everything, right?
At the time, I just liked yellow for some reason.
Bright yellow, to be specific.
The color yellow was just so beautiful to me.
From what I remember, we just had some yellow paint.
I did some construction work elsewhere and had some paint left,
which just happened to be yellow.
I didn't see the need to buy more,
so we just ended up using it. It didn't mean anything, actually.
At first, it wasn't called Yellow Door.
No. -It was Film Institute something, and… -Film Institute…
-It was Film Institute something, and… -Film Institute…
Then we studied semiotics and eventually ended up with Yellow Door.
That's right.
We would discuss things like signifiant and signifié.
Oh wow! This is embarrassing.
We'd tack those words on.
-We made it sound fancy like that. -Yes.
We only had scraped the surface but dared to talk about it.
"The signified and signifier don't match."
"See, there's an actual yellow door." We'd be like this.
Right!
That must be why the critique department was called "S-S."
-Signifiant, signifié. -Yes, I think so.
-The same goes for SA/sé. -Yes, right.
Signifiant, signifié.
-A famous cinematheque in Daehak-ro. -Yes.
-That's what the name means. -Yes.
We brought up signifiant and signifié in everything, didn't we?
Yes, you're right.
I mean, the words signifiant and signifié were very unfamiliar to us.
I mean, the words signifiant and signifié were very unfamiliar to us. Yes.
I guess we were proud of ourselves for learning that concept.
Why were we so obsessed with semiotics back then?
Semiology, postmodernism…
Postmodernism. -And post-structuralism. -Right.
-And post-structuralism. -Right.
Back then, Roland Barthes and such concepts were a fad.
We barely understood them, but still sat ourselves down
and had seminars about them.
I'm not sure if they still do this, but in front of our schools, there were…
-Copy places. -Popular copy places.
When you go there, they would have copies of renowned original books on display.
they would have copies of renowned original books on display.
There were anthologies too.
And Jong-tae would go, "We have to read this and this."
No. I didn't pick them out myself.
I just got everything. I didn't know what they were about!
I just bought them in bulk.
We picked out a few of them and did stuff like…
We studied Dudley Andrew's book together.
Dudley Andrew!
-Dudley Andrew. -The man who gave us a tough time.
Translating his book was a real pain.
Min-hyang was good at English. You majored in English Literature.
But it was still gibberish to me.
The other members' English was so-so.
Se-bum, when you were with us, what year were you in your Ph.D. program?
I was with you right before I began my program.
-It was right before? -Yes.
-But we all called you "Doctor." Dr. Ban. -Yes, Dr. Ban.
You knew I'd become one before I even started.
We gave you a weird nickname.
-An exegetic. -An exegetic scholar.
-An exegetic! -We would…
I remember. When we had seminars,
we'd divide pages and translate them.
If there were any errors, you would point them all out.
I'd point out each word and its meaning,
discussing how to translate them. That earned me that nickname.
Theoretical seminars seem great when you do it,
but you never remember anything once you're done.
Were you working for Director Kim Sung-su and his directing team at that time?
Yes, of course. I worked on many short films.
Most of the 16 mm short films back then.
Dae-yup, you know Beat, right? Jung Woo-sung's Beat.
-Yeah. -Yes, I know it too.
Seok-woo was the assistant director for that film.
Oh, I see. Back then, Director Kim Sung-su's team was highly renowned.
Back then, Director Kim Sung-su's team was highly renowned.
They worked people hard over there.
The people who survived through that were pretty much…
Then, out of the people we know, Seok-woo was the first to work on sets.
So, in your shoes, it must've been interesting…
So, in your shoes, it must've been interesting… Well, it'd be mean to say "funny."
After working on actual sets, you would come to Yellow Door
and find us excited about studying books in their original language.
To put it nicely, we were academic.
But to be frank, didn't it seem funny to you?
How did you feel about us holding weird seminars,
underlining and studying English books with Se-bum?
underlining and studying English books with Se-bum? Well, at the time,
Well, at the time,
it felt a bit amateurish.
-Right? -Yeah.
I was too stuck-up back then.
As I keep saying, sorry I was like that.
As I keep saying, sorry I was like that. No, that's not what I meant.
I was dying to make a short film,
but I didn't know anything and I had no experience.
So I thought, "If I rely on Seok-woo and sponge off him,
I might be able to start something."
Yoon-a, were you already in grad school at the time?
I was in my second semester of grad school.
Weren't you getting ready to study abroad?
I was married by then, good sir.
Oh, really?
Actually, I had just gotten married, so I couldn't participate much.
Actually, I had just gotten married, so I couldn't participate much. Well, I was a diligent member, but I couldn't do more.
Well, I was a diligent member, but I couldn't do more.
My life was too hectic.
So you were like Dae-yup. You were part of the grown-up group.
If we had to divide the club into two, we had the grown-ups and the kids.
So when we talked, I had to be formal with her.
It didn't matter if we were close or not.
She was a married woman, so I had to be respectful.
so I had to be respectful.
What's with that?
-What is that? -Go ahead.
I have a question. Am I the only one who remembers this?
We often ordered in for our meals.
Yes, we first used the name "Yellow Door" when we ordered Chinese food.
We'd order food during construction and say,
"Yes, come to the unit with the yellow door on the second floor."
-That's how we got the name. -Oh, that's why.
Yes, if someone wanted to visit us, we'd tell them,
Yes, if someone wanted to visit us, we'd tell them, "You'll see a yellow door. Come in that way."
"You'll see a yellow door. Come in that way." Then one day, Jong-tae said, "Let's just call ourselves Yellow Door."
Then one day, Jong-tae said, "Let's just call ourselves Yellow Door."
And we added meaning to it.
People would reference films,
but we had never seen the films that were being referenced,
so we had no idea what they were talking about.
For example, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, a German expressionist film.
For example, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, a German expressionist film. In the film history book, there would be one still image.
In the film history book, there would be one still image.
But we couldn't watch it, so we'd just imagine the film while studying it.
To show The Arrival of a Train to the students,
we had to make copies on videotape. There was no YouTube.
But now, we have everything.
Then what? We had to watch films.
And obtaining those films
was the greatest mission of a film institute.
Whenever we heard someone had a copy of a film,
we'd borrow it and make a copy of it.
That was our main task,
and Director Bong was in charge of that.
Back in our day, there weren't many places we could rent movies.
You know, these so-called art films.
But Director Bong had a knack for finding them.
Since things weren't digital back then, when we made copies,
we had to watch the film until the copy was finished.
We had no other choice.
If we made two copies, we had to watch it twice.
We'd make three to four copies of a movie.
Since we made multiple copies of the original video,
we would see interference on all the copies.
If we copied a video from the US,
it would start with an FBI warning.
WHOLESOME VIDEOS ARE LIKE GREAT ENVIRONMENTS
Korean videos would mention tigers and smallpox
Korean videos would mention tigers and smallpox  to discourage us from making illegal copies.
But making illegal copies was the only way we could watch them.
We'd write the title on the tape.
We'd write the title on a sticker and stick it on the tape.
We'd write the title on a sticker and stick it on the tape. But it didn't seem cool to see it handwritten.
But it didn't seem cool to see it handwritten. BREATHLESS JEAN-LUC GODARD, 1960
So I'd write the title of Godard's films in French.
I could've written down the Korean title.
The localized Korean title would've been just fine. But I wrote it in French.
I knew the spelling.
I still don't know how to pronounce it.
Those who speak French would know.
I'd print the titles on an A4 sheet.
Then I'd hold it up to a light and put the videotape stickers on top,
print the titles once again, and they would be in the right spots.
print the titles once again, and they would be in the right spots. Then I'd stick those on.
I put those little skills to use.
You'll find handwritten titles on some of the tapes,
but after a certain point in time, they'll be neatly printed on the stickers.
Making copies of films
Making copies of films and building our archive, tape by tape.
and building our archive, tape by tape.
We became very enthusiastic about it.
Obsession is what gets enthusiasts going.
The actions of an enthusiast seem very weird to a non-enthusiast.
But for the enthusiast, their motivation comes quite naturally.
I think our hunger for film-related materials is what led to our obsession.
We'd only need a spreadsheet nowadays.
But we had to do everything by hand.
I think…
Yes, I think I learned how to use a mouse from Joon Ho.
"This is called a mouse because it looks like one."
That's how he taught me.
-Since 1992. -Yes, since 1992.
"Video Library List."
"Managed by Bong."
-Nice handwriting. -What are the starred ones?
-Perhaps… -Ones we shouldn't lose?
Maybe. Or else…
Battleship Potemkin.
Before the Revolution by Bertolucci.
Maybe the starred ones are the ones…
-Ones we couldn't check out? -Right, something like that.
The Conversation by Coppola. We watched it together.
Yes, we did.
We bought some tapes too.
-We went to Hwanghak-dong. -Yes.
-There were wholesale stores. -Wholesale stores.
Street vendors were selling cheap videos.
-Those tapes were 2,500 won each. -Oh, were they?
-It was like a treasure hunt. -Yes.
Among these weird, lousy films, we'd find films by Kim Ki-young.
Among these weird, lousy films, we'd find films by Kim Ki-young. -Right. Yes. -Or Dušan Makavejev.
-Right. Yes. -Or Dušan Makavejev.
-Or something by Abel Ferrara. -Andrzej Wajda.
King of New York. Andrzej Wajda.
They were hidden here and there,
but the titles were oddly translated.
-Exactly. -So we needed to know how to find them.
The person who often gave us a list of new films,
information, and tips was Director Kim Hong-joon.
information, and tips was Director Kim Hong-joon. -Oh, I see. -One of the first-generation cinephiles.
-Oh, I see. -One of the first-generation cinephiles.
He's now the director of the Korean Film Archive.
He published a book too.
It had a long title. What was it?
Two or Three Things I Know About Film.
-It sold pretty well in the early '90s. -It did.
-Many people like us bought that book. -Yes.
If it was the '60s or '70s,
when it was impossible to watch any films mentioned in the book,
the book would've been useless.
If it was easy to watch films like now,
all of the information in that book wouldn't have been as useful.
Only a limited number of films were shown in theaters back then,
but the videotapes were all around us. So many films became available.
The influx made it almost impossible to tell the good ones from the bad.
"You may not be aware,
"You may not be aware, but this renowned director's work was published under this title."
but this renowned director's work was published under this title."
"And the title is quite absurd."
For example, "Something of Love." But the actual title…
So if we studied the book first…
-You'd know the basics. -We could find the film in Hwanghak-dong.
I believe Director Kim Hong-joon used a pseudonym.
I believe Director Kim Hong-joon used a pseudonym. -He didn't use his real name. -No.
-He didn't use his real name. -No. -Right. -It was Gu…
-Gu Hoe-yeong. -Gu Hoe-yeong!
It means "a cinephile who looks back on the '90s."
It was my first time writing an article about film for the mass media.
I got a little scared and didn't want to use my real name,
so I made up a pseudonym. That was Gu Hoe-yeong.
Later, people said it meant "a cinephile who looks back on the '90s,"
and I thought it sounded cool, but that's not true.
I was just wondering what name I should use
and found a newspaper next to me. The Hankyoreh, I think.
In the obituaries, I saw the name Gu Yeong-hoe,
In the obituaries, I saw the name Gu Yeong-hoe, so I just changed it to Gu Hoe-yeong for no reason.
so I just changed it to Gu Hoe-yeong for no reason.
Back then, the cultural status of film in our society was very poor.
It was a time when having a job in the film industry
was considered a disgrace to one's family.
How do we still have this? Count how many films we used to have.
Right.
You're good at counting.
Yes, I just eyeballed it.
About 300, 400 films?
-About 427 films? -Not as many as I thought.
-How many lines are on a page? -About 30 lines per page.
-There are 26 letters in the alphabet. -I have to count them.
-Four, five. -Let's say 20.
Eight.
Nine, ten.
Eleven and a half.
-I think-- -About 17 pages. 17 times 3.
-That would be 510. -510.
-We had about 500 tapes. -Yes.
Only those on record. But we stopped recording after a while.
Right.
When I first went to Yellow Door,
you were drawing a table on a huge piece of paper.
-A table? -Yes.
You often wrote stuff on big sheets.
Was it a list of late fees?
I have a tendency to be obsessive, so I was the perfect man for the job.
How should I put it? I was like the class monitor.
On duty for the whole year.
Yes, sort of.
A student who keeps track of those who chatted during class.
Those who didn't return the videotapes.
Those who didn't return the videotapes. "If you don't manage the tapes well,
you might lose in less than a month what took a year to collect."
Someone told me that, so I began to chase people around.
I asked, with a scary face,
"Why won't you return the Godard film you borrowed?"
That's what I did!
"Return the video. I know you took it two weeks ago."
You really are despicable.
I was serious about protecting the collection.
What do you mean by "despicable"?
What's that?
Wow. My gosh.
This was when we watched films and analyzed them.
"Detailed scene analysis."
"Apply the analysis framework by genre, director, and movement."
As if we could actually do these things!
We didn't know much, but we wrote it down anyway.
It says, "Analyze a film by scene."
It says, "Analyze a film by scene."
Jog Shuttle VTR.
Jog Shuttle VTR. Safe! Out!
-Safe! -It's out!
Let's check with the Jog Shuttle.
The Jog Shuttle catches every action.
-The jog dial was released. -Right.
Nowadays,
we can use iPhone apps or other mobile apps to edit videos
and even add visual effects, so this may sound too primitive.
But when the jog dial was released, we were thrilled.
But when the jog dial was released, we were thrilled. Right, yes.
We could fast-forward and rewind movies and analyze scenes frame by frame.
We could check how it was edited and how the double actions were done.
The cinephiles just before our generation,
such as Mr. Jung Sung-il, Director Kim Hong-joon,
they had to go to Goethe-Institut or Institut Français to watch films.
-And they couldn't rewind them. -Right.
-And they couldn't rewind them. -Right. But we got to analyze films using jog dials for the first time.
But we got to analyze films using jog dials for the first time.
I remember this.
We decided to hold the first text analysis seminar.
Wait, did I analyze Raging Bull? And Citizen Kane?
I did watch all of these films. City Lights, The Sacrifice.
I probably did analyze them. Do you have the materials?
I probably did analyze them. Do you have the materials? -Yes, we have them. -Really?
-Yes, we have them. -Really?
That's how we came to publish this.
I didn't do it by myself.
All the departments wrote the analyses and put them together.
It wasn't much, but we did it.
I think the first issue was the most important one,
but we couldn't keep this going.
Man, this is…
I went through so much trying to find this.
I went through so much trying to find this. -Where did you get this? -From Yoon-a.
-Where did you get this? -From Yoon-a.
-Oh, so Yoon-a had it. -Yes.
There's an analysis of Coppola's The Godfather in here.
I drew these.
"The Godfather is a rigid, textbook film in terms of formatting."
I wrote all kinds of nonsense as if I knew stuff.
This was from our seminar, right?
Yes.
I see I worked very hard on this one.
Thanks.
The suspense.
This is what you just mentioned, Director Lee.
The control of information.
The information in this view is only available to the audience.
-That's how suspense is created. -Suspense is created.
-That's how suspense is created. -Suspense is created. VIEW, SUSPENSE, CONTROL OF INFORMATION
I should have shown this to Coppola when I met him,
but I only told him about it.
There's a film festival held in Lyon.
Every year, the main event of the festival
is to invite big industry names and pay tribute to them.
That year, Coppola was the main guest.
They were going to present him with an achievement award,
and I was told to be the presenter.
So I went upstage and said this…
"Back when I was a university student, I also studied your films."
"I analyzed this scene from The Godfather."
I said something like that.
"Why was the camera there? Why did the shot change there?"
Why did this scene have to follow this one?
Why does the actor look that way at this moment?
I asked myself these questions and drew the scenes from The Godfather one by one.
and drew the scenes from The Godfather one by one.
My heart still pounds at this moment.
It hit me differently when I got to meet him in person up on the same stage,
sharing that story with him.
It felt marvelous and surreal.
Since then, even to this day, I watch films in units of cuts and shots.
In those shots, I look for the light sources,
the mise-en-scène, and all the details as I watch the film.
I loved what we did at first, but later on, it wasn't so great.
I began to wonder,
"Do I have to study languages and analyze each scene?"
"No way. This is so boring." That's what happened to me.
I realized it didn't sit well with me to analyze every single piece of a film.
That's the power of a film. It captures you without you knowing it.
I enjoyed watching films together since it was nice to know
that I had friends who also wanted to watch these films.
Yellow Door was a place where we gathered and talked
and learned things we didn't know before.
This just occurred to me.
In this movie, the actor lights a candle and then covers it as he walks,
trying to make sure it doesn't go out.
It was a film by Tarkovsky which I would find boring now.
I have no idea why I was so hooked on it.
As I watched it, I realized that film was art,
that I could dedicate my life to it.
I think that scene went on for over five minutes.
"What the heck? Is this what they call a film?"
Back then, that's what I thought.
Joon Ho really loved Martin Scorsese.
Its original title was Raging Bull.
But weirdly, the video company released it as The Fist of Fury.
But weirdly, the video company released it as The Fist of Fury. THE FIST OF FURY RAGING BULL
The Korean subtitles on that video had so many problems.
But despite that, the boxing sequence and everything
was just overwhelming, so I remember us going crazy as we watched it.
so I remember us going crazy as we watched it.
Director Lee, you also talked a lot about the editing and camerawork.
I was in my early days of studying film.
I used to think that complicated cuts and camerawork made good scenes.
But as you know, that scene is extremely simple.
It's simple, chilling, and funny, and you feel very sad once the scene ends.
You see Joe Pesci's face, and then a few more shots.
Then the camera pans just once.
When De Niro walks up the stairs, it's very scary.
When De Niro walks up the stairs, it's very scary. After he walks up, we see this crazy, wild violence.
After he walks up, we see this crazy, wild violence.
-It's terrifying. -I remember something else you said.
-That scene begins with a broken TV. -Yes.
De Niro is fixing the TV.
You said the broken TV sets the overall tone of the scene,
and I remember realizing that then.
-We said stuff like that? -No, well…
You did!
I don't remember a thing, not even what happened yesterday.
There was an animated film entitled The Man Who Planted Trees.
I guess I seemed miserable back then.
Hoon-a said to me,
"Jong-tae, when life is hard and you feel overwhelmed,
you should watch films like this. It will help you."
It was so nice.
I guess I was rather impudent with my words.
I thought Jong-tae was the one who told me to watch it.
I thought, "He introduced me to such a great film."
It really is a wonderful film. I watched it many more times after that.
It's the best film for me.
Oh, I'm not crying. My eyes are teary because they're old!
The two of you have different memories.
Yes, this is just like Rashomon.
-I see the yellow door. -That's the door.
Yes, you're right.
-Someone's directing. -We're doing something.
She's repeating her stiff performance.
These are the 8 mm films.
These were at home for the last 30 years in the wooden box.
You can see everything.
Cameras were not easy to come by.
Yes.
Especially video cameras. The films were too expensive.
Especially video cameras. The films were too expensive. -Right. -Our hands would shake as we filmed.
-Right. -Our hands would shake as we filmed.
It was frightening to use up 24 frames in a mere second.
It was probably around 1992.
It was probably around 1992. I had to save up the money.
He saved up the money from working at the study room.
I think he was paid 300,000 won a month.
He asked me if he could get a decent camera with that money.
You could find all kinds of electronics in Sewoon Plaza and Cheonggyecheon.
It was an expensive camera at the time. Hitachi 8200 Super VHS.
I bought it and took it to Yellow Door the next day.
I held it in my arms like this during the seminar.
It was huge too.
I'd flip the pages with the camera in my arms, patting it.
Nervous, should I say?
It was our first piece of equipment, so we were pleasantly nervous about it.
I did all my part-time jobs with the 8200, such as filming wedding videos.
I'd get all kinds of filming gigs
at all sorts of family events from birthday parties to weddings.
-Everyone's here. -This one.
We look great in this photo. It's nice.
Byung-hoon and Seok-woo are right next to each other.
There's a rumor that Byung-hoon left the industry because of me.
Seok-woo feels bad for you, Byung-hoon.
Why? What for?
Because he yelled at you so much while shooting short films.
Joon Ho is hiding back there.
Joon Ho is hiding back there. -Yes. -What is he up to?
I have no idea when this was taken.
I'm not really sure either. How did we end up taking this photo?
A spur-of-the-moment thing, maybe?
But we're all too dressed up.
Gosh, Hoon-a!
-Yes, it's the same day. -Right.
Am I bowing to someone here?
-I think it's a rite. -Yeah.
I see the head of the Hitachi 8200 over there.
-It's our opening ceremony! -It is!
-It says so right there. -That's it.
-I think so. -I remember that pig's head!
We couldn't afford an actual pig's head, so I drew that on paper.
-That's my drawing. -Yes, Joon Ho drew that.
I wrote the order of events on that huge sheet of paper.
-Really? -So that was your handwriting.
-The handwriting here? -Yes. That's not my handwriting.
I can see Gorilla written on it.
-Two. Yes, Gorilla 2. -Yes.
Gorilla 2.
-That was Gorilla 2? -Yes.
-Is that Looking for Paradise? -Yes, Looking for Paradise.
Gorilla 2, as if it was an actual series. How embarrassing.
Director Choi Jong-tae formed this club with a few younger people who were passionate about film.
with a few younger people who were passionate about film.
They said they were having an end-of-year screening.
Choi Jong-tae, Woo Hyun, and Ahn Nae-sang.
Hyun and Nae-sang are very busy actors now.
The three of them were a trio.
So Hyun and Nae-sang often came to Yellow Door.
We had lots of drinks too.
Yes.
A screening?
I thought it would be grandiose and fancy.
But it was held in a tiny room, a tiny office.
But it was held in a tiny room, a tiny office. I remember attending the event.

It was kind of boring. Rather tedious. I thought, "Yeah, I didn't expect much."
It was kind of boring. Rather tedious. I thought, "Yeah, I didn't expect much." So I wasn't really interested, and then…
So I wasn't really interested, and then…
As soon as Joon Ho's film started playing, I thought,
"What is this?" And I was completely sucked in.
I really want to watch it again. I mean it.
What did you do for the animated film?
Do you mean Gorilla?
-Were you controlling the stuffed toys? -We took turns.
Or were you handling the camera?
No, whoever got tired was in charge of the camera.
-Whoever had more energy moved the toys. -That's you, right?
-Whoever had more energy moved the toys. -That's you, right? Then we had to go up the ladders and hang it up high too.
Then we had to go up the ladders and hang it up high too.
Then we had to go up the ladders and hang it up high too. -Yes, you did the dangerous stuff. -I did those.
-Yes, you did the dangerous stuff. -I did those.
-Hang it off the pipes. -Yes.
I thought it'd be really fun.
-At first? -Yes, at first.
For about two days,
we shot in the basement of Daerim Apartment,
we shot in the basement of Daerim Apartment, the place with the pipes in Barking Dogs Never Bite.
the place with the pipes in Barking Dogs Never Bite.
There, we moved the stuffed gorilla little by little to shoot the film.
There, we moved the stuffed gorilla little by little to shoot the film. It was really tough.
The Hitachi 8200 offered many features.
I used it to shoot and edit the film.
And I could also insert subtitles,
not in Korean, but in English.
I had no choice but to make it silent and add English subtitles at the bottom.
The main character, Gorilla, goes up on a stone and poops.
-Yes, we had a stone. -Right?
It poops on top of the stone.
That voice was Director Bong's. The grunting as it poops.
The poop turns into a poop worm and attacks the gorilla.
And then…
It's embarrassing just to hear this.
In a way, it was also a monster flick. A mysterious creature appears in it.
We made those monster worms with white clay.
I thought it would be too gross to use brown clay.
Too disgusting.
The monsters attack the gorilla, and they start a fight.
The story was about the gorilla trying to get to a place without monsters.
A gorilla that lives in a dark, dirty basement
A gorilla that lives in a dark, dirty basement escapes to find its paradise.

There was a lush tree in the middle of a field.

but this one climbs up the gray pipes on the ceiling of the basement instead, dreaming of its escape.
When the gorilla began to move and make an effort to achieve its goal,
I thought, "How strange. This is a simple plot, a simple story."
"But when it's combined with cinematic imagination,
one can create something amazing."
Maybe it was because I wasn't a part of the production.
I didn't understand how hard it was to make a film like that.
I couldn't just say, "I don't think it's that great."
All the members who studied film gave him good reviews,
so I couldn't say otherwise.
So I just said, "Oh, nicely done."
So I just said, "Oh, nicely done." That was about the only critique I could give regarding that film.
Having said that, I was stuck-up back then,
I didn't think much of the film.
It's called stop-motion animation, right?
It's also called "release shooting."
I think I simply thought, "Well, if the camera has the function,
anyone can shoot it."
I was so embarrassed when I played it at the year-end party.
I remember my face going red.
I think it was the first time I created something with a narrative.
And there were about 15 to 20 people there too.
So they were like an audience.
It was just another year-end party, so everyone was like,
"Let's watch it already. Get it over with and start drinking."
But I was very nervous.
I remember turning completely red up to my ears.
That's when I decided to give up on animated films
That's when I decided to give up on animated films and turn to live-action.
and turn to live-action.
I had to move the toys a tiny bit at a time,
so later on, I began to have this animosity toward the main character.
I kept thinking, "Can you please move an inch by yourself?"
Naturally, I turned to live-action where the actors move on their own.
-Yes. -That's why.
But if you think back on it now, don't you think we were kind of insane?
The fact that we stayed up all night shooting it.
We set up at around eight o'clock.
Was the weather cold or hot?
I don't remember that. I was so focused, I forgot about it.
-No, I think it was cold. -It was chilly.
I think we had coats on.
-At that time, your mother… -Yes, my mom came downstairs.
-At that time, your mother… -Yes, my mom came downstairs. She came downstairs late at night and looked at us with pity in her eyes.
She came downstairs late at night and looked at us with pity in her eyes.
-She asked if we were done yet. -She did.
At that time, I was already discharged from the army.
At that time, I was already discharged from the army. Yes, right.
Her grown-up son was in the basement
with a stuffed gorilla in the middle of the night.
-Right. -It must've upset her so much.
She must've been really frustrated.
I believe the essential components of Director Bong's current films
were already established in Gorilla.
Most of his films have scenes shot in the basement.
Oh, you can go down to the basement and do your business.
The restroom in the maintenance office is too far from here.
This is the story from when this apartment was built.
Back in 1988, when apartment construction was booming…
Since you got discharged from the army and came to the factory in this town,
there have been a series of incidents.
I don't think this is forgery or crime.
I'm going to this university next year.
Oh, you had everything planned out!
-"He's going to make it." -Yes.
That I knew, but not that he'd make it this big.
You know, Hyun is…
He's very quick with numbers. He never wastes money on anything.
This guy funded Director Bong's first short film,
White Man.
I thought you gave him about three million won.
-No. -How much did you give him?
-No, I barely remember. -Is that so?
-No, I barely remember. -Is that so? A portion.
That's how I remember it, but he recorded the actual amount.
That's how I remember it, but he recorded the actual amount. -500,000 won. Yeah. -Is he sure?
-500,000 won. Yeah. -Is he sure? You told me it was three million won.
You told me it was three million won.
-I did? -You lied to me.
Hyun was there at the year-end party, and he watched my animated film.
Thanks to that, when I was shooting White Man,
he made a partial investment, so to speak.
He gave me some money when I shot the short film.
Woo Hyun-hui? Apparently, Joon Ho didn't know my name.
Does he still think… No, he must know your name now.
This might sound kind of awkward,
but this is the first time I've ever helped someone
and regretted it.
I didn't regret it back then.
But after a few years…
he made Memories of Murder.
MEMORIES OF MURDER BONG JOON HO, 2003 When I walked out after watching the film,
my heart felt heavy and stunned.
I was engulfed in deep emotions.
I said to myself,
"I should've paid for all of it."
"The entire production."
"Why was I so stingy and only paid for some of it?"
That's what I actually thought.
At the very end of the film, there was a single tree.
The film was entitled Looking for Paradise.
Now that I think about it,
I guess everyone wanted to find something.
I'm having such thoughts.
At the end, the gorilla reaches the tree and stands in front of it.
We're looking at the gorilla from behind, but as the camera slowly zooms out…
it turns out that the banana tree is actually inside a television.
I think I teared up at the end.
It was put together so well that you can relate to the gorilla.
Back then, I was still hanging around the school.
I was unemployed, not making any money.
I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do
or what I was supposed to do,
but I was certain about what I didn't want to do.
So, in a way,
I was like the gorilla.
Yes, I was.
When you consider video culture,
the new theater opening tomorrow will bring a wonderful revolution.
I actually paid a visit first.
Everything explodes around 1995, in the 100th year of cinema.
The very first art film theater in Korea will open tomorrow.
After Russia, Tarkovsky's Nostalghia probably performed best in Korea.
And about 60,000 people watched The Sacrifice.
Everyone would go and watch films like that, and…
then they would get a headache.
Countless magazines like Cine 21 and Kino were publishing their first issues.
They all read Mr. Jung Sung-il's articles in magazines. It was all the rage.
Statistics showed that what Jurassic Park, an American film, earned a few years ago
Statistics showed that what Jurassic Park, an American film, earned a few years ago was more than the total annual exports of all Korean automobiles.
was more than the total annual exports of all Korean automobiles.
I think, as we went through the mid to late '90s, the film industry started to take shape.
as we went through the mid to late '90s, the film industry started to take shape.
Some people suddenly became famous.
Some suddenly became the chief editor of a magazine.
Conglomerates have joined the film industry…
I think we were also motivated as we watched everything unfold.
Back in the '70s and '80s,
young people from my generation who loved movies used to get together
and complain about the industry.
"Why doesn't Korea have a film festival?"
"Why doesn't Korea have a film school?"
"Why doesn't Korea financially support short film productions?"
"I'm sure there's a paradise for film somewhere outside this country."
"I hope to go there someday."
The first-ever international film festival in Korea,
the Pusan International Film Festival,
the Pusan International Film Festival, kicked off splendidly tonight for its nine-day run.
One day…
I was busy writing my thesis for grad school at the time.
I wrote my thesis about film.
And I bumped into Joon Ho at Gangnam Station one day.
I asked him what he was doing there.
It felt really odd to see him there since we always met in Hongdae.
He told me that he was trying to get into a film academy.
He had to take an English test to get in,
so he was on his way to an English academy.
That's what he was doing at the time, studying English.
So I was surprised at that time. I was young too, so I thought,
"Joon Ho really takes film seriously."
To me, it was an escape from reality,
but to him, it was a career path.
I only realized this after looking back at that time.
Watching films and talking about them at the Yellow Door Film Institute,
I just thought that was enough.
I didn't know what the members wanted.
The biggest thing that I missed was that they wanted to make films.
They wanted to shoot films.
I guess the members had different expectations for the club.
There were discrepancies in the curriculum and the direction
that the members wanted to take.
Because of these discrepancies, there came a moment
Because of these discrepancies, there came a moment when we felt uncomfortable with one another.
Whatever it may be,
it's heartbreaking to watch something that has passed its prime.
Although Yellow Door wasn't something alive,
it had its decline like every living thing.
And I watched that process.
Everyone had different preferences and tastes.
We may have been one group,
but I think it's also true that we each had different dreams.
There was definitely something that couldn't bring us together.
And so, we decided to dissolve the club.
But after that,
I felt a little empty.
We dreamed together so passionately and achieved many other things too.
That's what we were,
but it only took a moment for us to fall apart.
And when it fell apart,
it instantly disappeared, like the tide going out.
And then there was the trip.
We decided to go on a trip. So we went somewhere in Gangwon-do by the East Sea.
So we went somewhere in Gangwon-do by the East Sea.
Those who wished to join got together at Cheongnyangni Station.
It was a fabulous trip.
I still remember it like it was yesterday.
Just as we were passing Jeongdongjin and the sun was about to rise,
the train began playing "Moonlight Sonata."
It was wonderful.
The announcement was telling us the last stop was near.
As "Moonlight Sonata" kept playing,
the train slid alongside the beach.
I think our time with Yellow Door
was like an act of a play.
So in whatever way, the act needed to come to an end
so that the play could go on to the second, third, and fourth acts.
As we went on with our lives for the next 30 years,
we continued to move on to the next acts.
We learned from what we lacked in the first act
and utilized what we learned in different ways.
That's how I think we were able to move forward.
The same applied to my life too.
Do you know that feeling? Let's say you had a person dear to you. Everything was great.
Let's say you had a person dear to you. Everything was great.
You walked holding their hand, but it couldn't last forever.
You have to let go at some point, but when you do, it's very awkward.
I think that's how I felt.
Me, personally,
I think it was for the best that we split up.
I mean, it was born out of our pure passion for film.
If we stayed together for a financial purpose or a clear goal,
we would've restructured the club to pursue something new.
I stopped watching movies soon after that.
I stopped watching movies soon after that. LIM HOON-A MEMBER OF YELLOW DOOR
The films I watched at Yellow Door
felt completely different from the films I watched outside.
I even asked myself if I really used to like those films.
Strangely, the films I watched at Yellow Door
felt like they meant more than what they seemed on the surface.
Once I returned to reality and bought tickets to watch films in the theater,
I no longer felt that way about them.
At the time, I was really saddened by its end.
And for a long time after that, I couldn't stop missing the old days.
But now, I think it's become an old but good memory of mine.
As I entered middle age,
I became very disheartened by it. Yes.
By how it all became nothing but a memory.
Film has been my path for a long time.
For a long time ever since, even until now.
I still think the search for one's path is meaningful,
even if it leads to a banana inside the TV.
I mean, that might be a process of self-realization.
Those who haven't begun their journey would be in the basement,
Those who haven't begun their journey would be in the basement, believing that there are bananas up there.
In a way, there are moments
when I think I can see the tree that was on the screen.
ROAD FEVER KIM MIN-HYANG (2014)
I'm not sure how much time I have left,
but I have a feeling that I can get close to the tree and finally touch it.
I think I can do that now.
It's embarrassing to say this, but when I began to paint,
I found myself painting something close
to the last scene of Looking for Paradise without even realizing it.
It was an image of a young girl looking for something.
I wasn't thinking about Yellow Door when I painted it.
But when I think about it today,
I must have painted my desire to look for something new.
The fact that we made a lot of memories together 30 years ago,
and that for a brief moment,
we had fun just hanging out with no worries about the future.
It feels like a piece of a puzzle.
Everything I shared until now
are stories from about 30 years ago.
But to think that 30 years have passed,
I just can't believe it.
We lit up like a flame in 1992 and 1993.
I'm sure we all have different memories from that time.
Some were there only briefly. Some stayed for a long time.
And there's Jong-tae, who was in the eye of the storm.
I'm sure the memory is different for all of us.
When I look back on it,
I don't think
I have ever been as passionate about film as I was then.
They are the times that made me who I am today,
and the times I want to remember.
And even after leaving the club,
it showed me the path for me to follow afterward.
It was my beginning.
Yellow Door.
Do you think we'd do a good job if we did it again now?
"About the Yellow Door Film Institute."
"The Yellow Door Film Institute is a group  of people who assembled to study film."
"We don't think studying film is something one can do on one's own."
"As we shared information and materials, the group gradually got bigger."
"As we shared information and materials, the group gradually got bigger." "Now there are more than 30 of us."
"Although we still have a long way to go, we have named ourselves a film institute."
"According to the cinematic path of our choice,
we are divided into departments for critique, directing, and screenwriting."
"These departments each conduct their own various activities."
"The members of the film institute include a variety of people,
from those who were just introduced to film studies, to graduate students,
as well as other graduate and doctorate students of humanities."
"But we all have one thing in common."
"We wish to unfold our life's journey through the medium of film."
"The institute provides suitable programs to meet the needs
of members of different levels."
"We believe this is a good place for those who wish to begin their studies
with a theoretical approach."
"Of course, each department also provides
a training program for creative projects."
"The Yellow Door Film Institute
awaits young, enthusiastic, and talented film students."
"Knock on the yellow door of the institute and push that hefty door open,
"Knock on the yellow door of the institute and push that hefty door open, leading you to your life with film and the Korean film industry."
leading you to your life with film and the Korean film industry."
That was grandiose.
Talk about grandiosity!
Ryo.
Ryo.
Ryo!
Ryo!
Ryo!
Somebody!
Anyone here?!
Is anyone here?!
-All right, listen up. -Yes, sir.
There might be more people under the rubble. We should…
There might be more people under the rubble. We should… Excuse me! I can't find my son!
Where are the rescued…
Ryo.
Mr. Kanda. You're okay.
Yuko, are you all right?
I'll get some blankets.
Have you seen my son?
Mr. Kanda.
What's going on?
Hello?
Somebody…
It's not safe in there!
Wait.
Wait.
Hey!
Are you okay?
Thank goodness.
I woke up washed up on the beach.
No one is responding to me and I can't feel any physical touch.
I didn't know what was going on and then you called out--
I understand.
First…
Let's try to calm down first.
Take a deep breath.
It was a pretty big one.
For now, come to our place.
Oh, can you walk?
Like I said, I came up with the idea for this star sand.
Okay?
You've seen these in souvenir shops, right?
I used to buy them for my family on work trips.
Right?
That's all me.
There he goes again.
It's the truth, okay?
You see, I participated in a student protest, right?
I went completely broke back then, so I ran away to Iriomote Island.
And you stuffed the sand in bottles and sold them, right? We heard.
Oh, do we have a new guest?
From that earthquake?
Probably.
Well, hi there.
You must've been through a lot.
That… It was huge.
Michael.
Um, what's this place?
Well…
It's hard to explain, but…
It's all right.
Don't worry.
We've got plenty of time, okay?
Kaori, give her a tour.
Sure. I'm Kaori.
This way.
I'm sorry.
What is all this?
I-I don't want to explain.
Well…
People who have regrets in the living world are gathered here.
Well, it's not just here.
There are places like this all over the country.
Regrets?
What do you mean?
Hey, Akira.
Don't beat around the bush.
Then you tell her, Shori.
So basically, you died.
But you can't go over to the other side because you have some unfinished business.
Died?
I died…
Now, now. Come on. Get some rest for today.
We have alcohol too.
I don't want any.
Come with me, okay?
You'll be fine.
There's probably a guy. Probably.
Really? At her age?
Hang on.
This way.
The last occupant left.
So feel free to stay here.
I know it's a lot to handle all at once.
So get a good night's rest.
Are you all the same as me?
That's right. We're your seniors.
We're quite the experts.
Goodnight.
Here's your baby. Congratulations.
Why won't you understand?!
I'm--
That's what you want!
Mind your own business!
There, there.
Ryo, come here. Scary!
Happy birthday to…
Congratulations!
-Look. -Move.
What are you doing?!
Mommy, look. Stop!
Hurry up and go.
-I don't want to go! -Why? I have to go to work!
I don't want to go to school!
Mommy.
Wake up.
-Mommy! -Ryo!
-Hey. -Morning.
Good morning.
Hey.
Hi there. Good morning.
Good morning. Kaori, I'd like some coffee too.
Sure thing.
Here.
What's that?
It's yoga.
A dead person doing yoga and trying to stay healthy?
Shut it.
Yoga.
I'm the one who brought yoga to Japan.
Enough already. It's the truth.
That's how I hurt my back. Right here.
Good morning.
Hey, miss. Good morning.
You look cute in daylight.
What's your name?
Minako Kawakami.
Minako.
Man, really. You're pretty.
Michael. You can't say things like that in this day and age.
What? Really? Why?
This old man here is Michael.
And the guy who brought you here is Akira.
That young man is Shori.
He used to be a yakuza.
That's Mr. Tanaka, a former banker
and I'm Kaori, a former hostess of a bar.
J-Join us.
Hey!
STOCK MARKET CRASH
1990 OCTOBER 2
This…
Well, it's an old habit of mine.
Can I borrow your car key?
Huh?
Oh, sure.
She's got a bad attitude.
PLEASE CONTACT US IF YOU HAVE INFORMATION ON MISSING CHILDREN LISTED BELOW
Chinatsu!
Aiko!
Kazuki!
You too?
I got separated from my family.
I thought I might find them if I shout their names out every day.
But…
if they can hear me, it means they're dead.
I hope… you find your family too.
The highway acted as a breakwater, so urban areas were less affected.
We haven't found Kawakami yet.
Let's hope she's safe.
The rescue teams are doing their best to find the missing people.
What we can do right now is to work with the police
and report accurate news promptly.
Get to work.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Kanda, I'm right here.
-Oh, welcome back. -Hi.
Uh, yeah.
Oh, thank you.
Great timing. We're having hot pot tonight.
You wanna join us?
Sorry, I'm not in the mood for it.
That's exactly why you should come.
Okay?
Oh…
It is now autumn
At this empty beach
Even if
A single dream breaks
His one-thousandth time.
I won't forget you
Because I promised the sand
No matter how sad I am
I will not die
"Empty Beach."
I-It's such a good song. Right, Shori?
Sure, sure.
Minako, do you want to sing something?
No thanks.
Yeah? That's a shame.
Okay, here it is. The hot pot's ready!
Come on.
-Done. -Come here.
Thank you.
So heavy!
Kaori's special hot pot!
Looks good!
-Have some meat. -Come on. Let's eat.
Meat gives you energy.
-Let's dig in. -Let's eat.
Yum!
Um…
Do you all have regrets in the living world?
Well, yeah.
R-Regret is all we have.
Is that why you're all lazing around?
I wouldn't say we're lazing around.
Huh?
Well, I guess it does look like we're just fooling around.
I don't mean to be rude,
but I can't waste my time like this.
Minako.
Could you stick around for just today?
Why?
Because
we might be able to help you.
Y-Yeah. That's what I was going to say.
Yeah, right.
It's time. Hurry up and eat!
Hurry.
Hi there.
We can't start without doing this, right?
Start what?
We always do this as a purification ritual before making films.
He's a self-proclaimed film producer.
Come see when you have time. They're all masterpieces.
Y-You can watch them all in the cinema over there.
All right. Let's get going.
Okay, then. Let's go.
What's everyone doing?
Once a month,
on the night of a new moon, we all get together and search.
What?
We search for the ones we're looking for.
This is so strange.
I didn't think I'd be with people when I died.
Shori.
Trying to make sense of a contradiction is a contradiction in itself.
That's true.
Oh, hey. Hey!
I found them.
Chinatsu.
Dear…
Aiko.
-Dad. -Dad…
Kazuki.
I'm sorry.
Strange, isn't it?
We're dead, but we're here.
We definitely exist in this world.
We exist.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't protect you.
My back hurts.
Kaori, beer please.
Okay.
Here.
-Thank you. -Does Minako want any?
I'll give it to her.
Thanks.
Here.
What did you think?
What?
Uh…
I was surprised…
and confused.
Who wouldn't be?
Minako, I hope you find your boyfriend soon too.
Hey! That's enough.
Why?
It's my son.
I… I have a son I raised alone named Ryo. He's seven.
I have a son I raised alone named Ryo. He's seven.
My only concern is whether he's alive or not.
Will you let me stay here a little longer?
Thumbs up to that.
O-Of course you can.
We'll find him. Thumbs up?
Thumbs up then.
Thumbs up.
Right, come here. Let's have a toast.
We understand.
Kaori.
-All right. Cheers. -Cheers.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
It's open.
Oh, come in.
W-What are these?
These are the notes I've been taking.
But you know,
I'll summarize them into one story. I am an author.
Right.
Something wrong?
Um, thank you for asking me to stick around the other day.
I feel a little better.
No worries. I know what you're going through.
Are you looking for someone too?
Oh, no. I'm not.
I just want to take note of all this.
I want to keep a record that there's a world like this after we die.
Is that your unfinished business?
I'm not sure.
Oh. You want the car, right?
You can use it whenever you want.
Thank you.
We'll definitely find him.
Don't worry.
You can rely on us more.
Minako.
Please let me interview you sometime.
Tell me about your life.
If you'd like.
Hi there.
Hey.
Nice.
Looking good.
Shut up.
I made a yakuza film a long time ago.
One of those half-assed films, right?
No, it's a very good one. I'll show it to you sometime.
Sure, sure.
Okay, I'm off.
CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY CONFERENCE IN CHAOS

MISSING FROM HOSHISUNA, MINAKO KAWAKAMI (35)
Boss, happy birthday.
Congratulations.
I appreciate it.
Drink up.
Thank you.
Dad, happy birthday.
Eat. Thank you.
WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE?
I'm back.
Hi.
Kaori, b-beer please.
Sure thing.
-I'll leave it here. -Yeah.
What's wrong, Shori?
You look glum.
Huh? Do I?
Today was your dad's birthday, right?
How was he?
Well, he's gotten pretty old.
Well, yeah.
It's already been seven years since you came here.
I wonder sometimes.
That it wouldn't have been this way if I stayed by his side.
I made a yakuza film before.
But the yakuza t-today have it rough.
They're a symbol of society.
B-But they were separated from society and they're not even given human rights.
I'll show it to you when you come to the cinema next time.
Yeah, okay. I got it.
What's your unfinished business, Shori?
What's with the sudden interest?
I told my story to everyone.
I ended up here because I was killed in a yakuza conflict seven years ago.
I left my wife behind.
Huh? You were married?
Well, not exactly a wife.
It wasn't official.
He's actually quite a softie.
What? Keep your mouth shut.
You've been looking for her for seven years?
Well, I'm not really sure.
Maybe I don't want to see her.
It's not like I can hold her anymore.
WHAT HAPPENS IF UNFINISHED BUSINESS IS LEFT UNRESOLVED?
Hello?
Is everyone else safe?
I see. Let's do our best.
Yeah.
Bye.
1970, OKINAWA
It is now autumn
At this empty…
Sasaki, Tamashiro was arrested.
I see.
Authorities are coming with an iron fist.
They're coming for you next.
Keep a low profile.
I know.
Tamashiro's arrest will be the headline for tomorrow's flyer.
Yeah. I'll get it done by the end of the day.
So, Maiko.
See you tomorrow.
Koga.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Don't worry.
The other day our comrade, Tamashiro, was unlawfully arrested on the street.
We will never give in to such oppression from the authorities!
That's right!
Now is the time for students--
We cannot let you occupy the university any longer.
Remove the barricade and come out immediately.
Sprechchor!
Sprechchor!
Give Okinawa back to us!
Give Okinawa back to us!
We're against the Vietnam War!
We're against the Vietnam War!
Remove the U.S. military base!
Remove the U.S. military base!
Charge!
Unite!
Unite!
Unite!
Unite!
Koga!
What time is it?
It's still midnight. You should lie down.
Does it hurt?
You scared me!
Sorry. I kind of just walked in.
M-M-Minako.
W-What a surprise.
What was that film called?
Oh. In Search for Lost Time.
It's great, right?
Yeah. It ended halfway though.
Yeah, I know. It's not complete because I died.
Really?
This film will leave a very huge impact on young people today.
It's incredible.
The poster was going to be Maiko, the heroine, standing alone on the beach.
And bam! The title right on top.
It was going to be a huge hit.
The poster was decided already?
O-O-Of course it was.
I was the decision-maker for everything.
The theme, story, and all of it.
But why did you want to shoot a film about a student protest?
Oh, this.
This is a true story about me.
It's an autobiography?
Not exactly…
You see, I was participating in a student protest.
Regardless of whether it was right or w-wrong,
there was unity.
Films are the same.
A bunch of grown-ups working passionately towards the same goal. It's amazing.
You really loved films, huh?
Yeah.
If it's an autobiography, was Maiko your girlfriend?
Yeah, well. I-I guess s-she was.
What happened to you two?
Well, you know. A-A lot happened.
But I wish she could've seen the completed film.
I think she might still be waiting.
Nah.
I wonder.
I'm home.
Welcome back.
Hey, dinner's ready.
Come on, Kenta.
She said dinner's ready.
Hey, Kenta. Stop playing your game.
-Riko, this is for Mom. -Okay.
Kenta! I said dinner.
Here.
You? The usual amount.
-Kenta? -I want a lot.
A lot… This good?
Yeah, thanks.
Kenta, you're gobbling up the food.
So? How are your club activities going?
Seconds.
-You have a match next week? -Yeah.
Think you can win?
Piece of cake.
-They were mercy-ruled last time. -Don't say that!
W-Why'd you… I saw that game too.
Don't bring it up.
The baby kicked.
Really?
Wait, hold on… Do it again.
-The baby kicked! -Yeah.
-Kenta. -I'm good.
Come.
It's vintage, but it's still usable.
Look, it's so shiny.
Hey, Minako.
Good morning.
What are you doing?
I was deeply moved by your words yesterday!
What? Which words?
Why did you get him worked up? I've got plans today.
Seriously, I'm not following.
Minako, you worked in TV, right?
More like a journalist.
Okay, then. Take this.
Listen,
I decided to complete that film.
Come again?
All right. Everyone listen.
TV shows come and go, but films are unforgettable.
I can't have you doing this halfheartedly.
So what are we supposed to--
Right. Akira, you look slow. So you can hold this.
What? This?
Kaori, you do the recording.
Wow, that's an important job.
-Tanaka, you're the assistant director. -Yes. Yes.
And Shori.
Y-You're good looking, s-so you can play my son.
Here's the script. What?
IN SEARCH FOR LOST TIME
Michael, you're the director?
I'm the lead and the director. It's Yang Ik-june style.
What? What style?
-Huh? -Okay, then.
Let's begin.
Take one.
Ready.
Start.
It's been… 50 years since then.
What's next?
-"I want to see her again." -Huh? What?
What?
"I want to see her again."
Cut!
Ready, roll!
What was it?
Um…
Oh, your board is in the shot.
"I want to see her again."
It's not about the lines.
It's the emotion.
Okay. Once more.
I'm into it already.
It doesn't open smoothly.
"I want to see her again."
I know that.
Too bright!
How long do I have to wait?
Just get into… Watch me and prepare for your role.
-Let's do this in one take. -Yeah.
-It's been 50 years since then. -I know that.
W-W-What? W-Why are you turning it?
It's nothing.
We can start with "It's been…"
O-Oh, well. It's still the first day.
The team is not one yet.
Is that how it is?
Yes, it is.
Filmmaking is all about teamwork. Right?
Why are you asking me?
Anyway, I think we all need to hold a review meeting.
Minako, I'll teach you about the camera.
I'm good.
-Why? Come on. -Huh?
Is that a guest?
I'll go.
At such a young age…
Hello.
You can see me?
What's going on?
I'm new here too.
Let's go over there for now.
Your name?
Nana.
Hi there.
You like films? What?
Nice to meet you.
I know. It's shocking, right?
I'm sorry, but-- I'm not sorry.
I'm so glad my shitty life ended.
We've got one very jaded kid in the house.
Huh? Who the hell are you?
Okay.
Young lady, there's a place you can rest. Let's go.
That girl is you-know-what, right, Tanaka?
Probably.
Okay, I'm off.
Shori.
Huh?
Congratulations starting your seventh year.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, Shori.
I've decided to dissolve the group.
KATO FAMILY
THANKS FOR LETTING ME RIDE ON YOUR PRECIOUS MOTORBIKE!
I'm home.
Hi.
You're home early.
Yeah. I sent you a text.
I didn't realize. Sorry.
Curry for dinner?
Yeah, thanks.
Mizuki.
I got a day off next week.
Do you want to visit my parents?
I haven't had the chance to introduce you.
Yeah. Sounds good.
I think we should talk about our future too.
You're right.
It's been a while.
You haven't changed at all.
He seems like a good guy.
Well, I'm better looking than him though.
I'm sorry.
Have a good life.
…memories of you
Even if you do not return
I won't…
-You're back late. -Hey.
Kaori, I'll have a hard one.
Sure thing.
Because I promised the sky
No matter how lonely I am
I will not die
No matter how lonely I am…
Shori, did something happen?
…I will not die
I saw her.
What?
Seems like she's already over me.
She looked well.
I think she's getting married.
That's a relief, huh?
Yeah.
And you know what?
Her new man is such a great guy.
The complete opposite of me.
I'm so glad.
She'll be okay now.
I'm sure.
Hey, Shori!
Y-You haven't seen my film yet.
You're right.
I'll watch it.
Your boring yakuza film.
Yeah, t-that's what I'm talking about.
Then, let's go. Let's go now.
-Akira, get the car. -Let's go.
Let's go!
-You're gonna be moved. -Are you sure?
Hey, kid.
Make sure to live your life.
What?
You have anywhere to go?
You wanna join us? Boss, what are you--
Oh, come on.
Doesn't hurt to have a bigger family.
What's your name?
Masashi…
Yamada.
So? It's good, right?
It's all right.
Come over once things are settled.
Let's go.
Shall we go?
Yeah.
I'm the one who made yoga popular.
Not again.
It was 30 years ago. I was in advertising, right?
There was a fitness boom back then--
Shori's gone so there's no one here to stop him.
-I was the one-- -Nana, good morning.
Morning.
Where's that yakuza guy?
He went to the other side.
Y-You're not making sense.
Do you have regrets or unfinished business from when you were alive?
What?
I think that's the reason you're here.
You're freaking me out. Is this some kind of cult?
A cult? How rude.
Oh, hey. Do you want to shoot a film with us?
-Minako, shall we go? -Ew.
Sure.
Nana, take a seat.
DECEASED
Every day, I'm scared to look through this.
I wonder what'll happen to me if I find Ryo's name here.
Yeah.
So you want to know about my life?
Yes.
I want to know more about you before you move on to the other side.
Um…
I'm Minako Kawakami. 35 years old.
I was a journalist here, for Hokuto TV, and a single mother to a seven-year-old.
Your husband?
We split up soon after Ryo was born.
I wanted to work but he didn't want me to.
Since then, it's just been Ryo and me.
What was this world like for you?
You mean the living world?
Yes.
I don't know.
I was so frantic with work and parenting.
Looking back, I don't know why I was trying so hard.
If you could go back, what would you like to do?
I want to…
go on a trip with Ryo.
Because I've never been able to take him on one.
And…
I want to apologize to him.
There are lots of unknown facts in the world we can't see,
such as atoms, electrons and elementary particles.
For example, what we're experiencing is three dimensional.
Four dimensional, if we add time.
Lisa Randall, a scientist…
It's gonna go viral.
This is genius.
Are you gonna post it?
-So true. -Hey…
Yasuko.
Don't slit your wrist like Nana, okay? It's so annoying.
Everything okay there?
-Yup. -Sorry.
So let's review the word "dimension."
It is defined as an indicator for measurement of space.
Okay. What is one dimension? It is a line.
Here's dessert.
Hey.
Oh, Nana.
I get that I died, but…
Can I kill a person?
There's someone I wanna kill.
Hey, Nana.
Don't say things like that.
We can't harm people in the living world from this world.
How stupid.
I mean, you're all dead.
Hey.
It has no taste at all.
How long do I have to stay in this hell?!
Nana.
Why don't you come with us?
I want to show you something.
What?
Trust me and just tag along.
All right, then. Let's go!
Huh?
What's this?
Everyone who died and left behind those who are important to them.
We all search together…
for the ones we are looking for.
The ones we're looking for…
I don't know what your regret is,
but we can help if you want.
Hey, over here!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
-Isn't this good? -I got a message!
I…
There's someone I want to apologize to.
This is your baby's face. There's the eyes and nose.
Here's the mouth.
I didn't want to die until my daughter gave birth.
So, I fought my destiny and here I am.
This world is pretty lenient, isn't it?
I think so too.
I was able to be with them for a long time.
I have no more regrets.
Watching my kids all this time made me realize…
that they're very strong.
Maybe they would've been fine without me from the start.
I think that sometimes.
That's not true.
DAY 32, NOTHING ON SHELTER'S NOTICEBOARD HOKUTO TV, NO PROGRESS
Oh my, Michael.
Hey, why are you sleeping here?
Let's go to your room, okay? Mr. Tanaka, give me a hand.
Let's go to your room, okay? Mr. Tanaka, give me a hand. Okay.
Wake up.
Michael, you ready?
One, two, lift.
Okay, let's walk.
He's so drunk.
Is it going well?
Yes. I enjoy writing.
I can't see the end though.
It's your turn, Akira.
Tell me.
What? No. I have nothing interesting to tell.
You always dodge the question when it's about you.
Do I?
I want to know what your life was like.
Minako, I'm sensing the spirit of a journalist.
You're right.
But…
I guess I don't mind telling you.
The reason why I can't go to the other side.
Is this your…
Yes.
My dad looks stubborn, right?
I've always been sickly so for me,
his existence was the scariest thing in the world.
Your lunch stinks.
What? She's picking them up.
What's she going to do with that?
Is she gonna eat that?
That's disgusting.
What a freak. She got something on me. Ew.
-You okay? -So gross.
Nana.
Y-Yasuko.
Yasuko, I'm sorry!
Nana…
Why…
Nana…
Nana, why…
Yasuko, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, Yasuko.
I'm so sorry.
Why… Nana.
Nana.
I practically lived in my bed.
I was a ranch owner's son, but I wasn't capable of physical labor.
I always thought my dad didn't accept me as a member of the family.
When they told me my remaining days,
I thought, "Why me?"
I took it out on my family so many times.
I've hurt them a lot.
I think…
this is the reason why I can't move on.
My dad, who's never even read a book,
has been writing a novel for many years now.
A story about me.
If I were alive,
maybe he wouldn't be writing a novel.
Or maybe he would've anyway. I'll never know.
But it made me happy.
It felt like I finally got to know my dad.
AKIRA CHEERED ON THE NEWBORN CALF…
Though…
I only wish I had known while I was alive.
Nana.
Your room's a mess.
My bad.
What are you writing?
I'm keeping a record of everything that's happened since I got here.
BEFORE GOING TO "THE OTHER SIDE" (WORKING TITLE) CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Something wrong?
You know,
I apologized.
But…
nothing changed.
Why?
I'm sure that one day, your voice will be heard.
Don't worry.
That's not an answer.
You can borrow that.
Goodbye.
-Goodnight. -Goodnight.
Minako!
Minako!
Minako, he's alive!
Y-Y-Your son! He's alive!
He's alive.
HOSHISUNA HOME FOR CHILDREN
We'll wait out here.
Ryo has a fever again.
It's already been a week. Let's take him to see a doctor again tomorrow.
Okay.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Ryo, we'll go to the doctor tomorrow, okay?
I want to see my mommy.
I know.
I'm sure we'll find your mom.
Ryo.
I'm sorry I left you all on your own.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Are you there?
Yes.
I'm right here.
I wanted to apologize to you.
I went to pick you up from your school,
but I was washed away by the tsunami.
I'm sorry.
Mommy, we're going home together, right?
I wish I could.
Do I have to live here forever?
I'm so sorry.
I'll watch over you so that you won't be alone, okay?
Okay.
Mommy.
Tell me a story until I fall asleep.
Sure.
Which story?
Something fun you did recently.
In the world I'm in right now,
everyone helps to find each other's loved ones.
Like a parade.
That sounds amazing.
They helped me find you too.
I see.
Then, it's your turn to help everyone.
Yeah.
You're right.
Hey, Mr. Tanaka.
Yes?
I have one unfinished business.
Will you help me out?
If it's within my power.
Akira.
Don't give me that "I'm so heartbroken" look.
What are you talking about?
I'm not.
Yeah, but Minako was a fox.
If I was younger, I would've--
Ew.
What?
What do you mean "Ew"?
Ew.
Minako.
I'm back.
Come here.
You want coffee? Thanks, Kaori.
Michael.
I haven't thanked you properly.
Thank you.
Stop it. You're making me blush.
Your film.
Let's complete it.
Huh?
I'll stay until we do. You want her to see it, right?
Come on, stop it! You're gonna make me cry.
All right. I-I'll do it. Yeah.
This film is going to be great. You too, Nana.
What? No way.
Nana, this is mandatory.
No way.
-Tanaka. -Yes.
Get the camera.
As you wish!
All right.
Let's do this.
-It's rolling. -Okay.
Take one.
Ready, start!
It's been 50 years.
This film is almost complete.
The protagonist, Koga, believed in the revolution and devoted himself to the student protest.
But in fear of getting caught,
he decides to go back to Tokyo on the day of the protest…
without his girlfriend.
He ran away.
The pathetic fool.
Koga, wait!
I'm sorry.
There's no way I can start a revolution.
You don't have to.
Just stay with me.
We'll meet again. I promise.
And so, Koga quit the student protest
and ran away to Tokyo.
I know these will sell.
Maiko married Sasaki.
And Koga buried himself in work.
They both lived their lives with a lid on the past they had shared.
50 years had passed.
Koga returned to the city of Okinawa again.
Memories of that day come back to his mind like it was yesterday.
M-M-Maiko…
He's really into it.
Are you Mitsuru Koga?
And by a strange coincidence…
Koga has an encounter with Maiko's grandchild.
Huh? Me?
You know my grandma, right?
Huh?
Are you Maiko's…
Please come see her.
Grandma's been longing to see you.
Cut.
What are you, a prodigy?
You're incredible!
It's a thumbs up! Wonderful!
Nana!
Stop it!
Please come see her.
-Michael, don't! -He's mocking me.
I see.
You went on before me.
Koga!
Goodbye!
Koga,
live your life to the fullest.
Koga!
Maiko.
Maiko!
Maiko!
Koga!
Maiko!
Maiko!
Michael.
-No. Wait, Michael. -Michael!
Michael! What's wrong?
Maiko!
Michael!
Maiko!
Let's show it on the big screen.
Yes, let's.
What's wrong?
A-About that…
I want to give this film to someone.
But I feel really embarrassed doing stuff like that.
Could you all go and do it for me?
What? Do it yourself.
I know, but…
Michael.
Let's go together.
I'll come with you.
T-This is kinda nice. This whole camaraderie thing.
Okay.
I'll go.
For real? There's so many people.
Yeah. It's crazy.
Hey, you guys.
There's something I want to show you. Come with me.
This way.
Look at this!
See this?
Is this you, Michael? -You're a major producer. -Don't flatter me.
-You're a major producer. -Don't flatter me. You weren't lying.
Of course I wasn't.
I thought you were. Yeah, we all did.
See. Oh, wow.
"FILM SHOULD BE FREEDOM"
This is nerve-wracking.
I-I'm really bad at stuff like this.
You're gonna be fine. We'll wait for you out here.
I changed my mind. We came all the way out here.
But--
Koga. Is that you?
S-Sasaki?
What is it? After all this time.
I-I want to apologize to Maiko.
Please let me see her.
Come in.
Sasaki, when did you die?
Two years ago. Cancer.
I see.
What's that?
Oh, this.
It's my new film.
I-It's about me, M-Maiko, and you.
Films even after you died?
You film freak.
That's right.
This is the only thing I can do.
This way.
Maiko, you haven't changed at all.
She's always been rooting for you.
But she chose you.
You know…
I still think about the time we spent back then.
We couldn't start a revolution.
But…
We were united. That, I know for sure.
Maiko.
M-Maiko.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hi there.
Is everything okay?
It was perfect. Excellent.
You didn't give it to her?
Yeah, but if you think about it, you can't watch films at home.
I'll do it when it's on DVD.
It won't be on DVD though.
Oh, c-come on. It's okay.
Now, shall we go home?
Hey, everyone.
Why don't we have a film screening?
We can invite everyone.
Great idea.
I was a-about to say that myself.
Really? Yeah.
-Let's do that. -Yes, let's.
All right. We're doing this!
Michael, we're ready.
Good e-evening everyone. I'm Michael.
I forced my friends to help me and we managed to complete the film.
T-This f-film has the power to revolutionize the era.
And I also think that it c-connects the past and the present.
"Films even after you died?"
That's what my friend said. But hey, whoever does it first wins.
I hope… you enjoy the film.
So, I have an idea for a new film.
Another one?
An autobiography.
I want to make a film about the time I've spent here.
Michael, that's my idea.
T-Then, we can do it together.
This is going to be a masterpiece.
I can't let you.
No?
Minako.
You okay?
Oh, yes.
It just hasn't sunk in yet.
Same here.
To be honest, I'm feeling a little uneasy too.
Hey, Mr. Tanaka. Yes?
W-What is it like on the other side?
I can't tell you.
What?
Mr. Tanaka is kind of like our warden.
What? Why didn't you tell me? That's so scary.
O-Oh, come on. Tell us already.
You'll find out soon anyway.
Tanaka, you're so hard-headed.
But you know what?
Making the film was fun.
Right?
Films are great.
A bunch of grown-ups w-working passionately towards the same goal. It's amazing.
-Yeah. -Right?
Nana.
Make more films, okay?
You can use the notes in my room.
Work hard, Nana.
Why only me?
Akira.
I'll leave the rest to you.
Make sure to keep a detailed record of this world.
You can count on me.
But you gotta stay on the offense. Don't lose, all right?
Who's he competing with?
Let's have a toast.
A toast.
Cheers.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
We still have some food left. Eat up.
Let's eat.
Could I have some of that?
-Have fried chicken too. -Okay, then one please.
Thank you.
Here's the fried…
-About this much? -Yes, thank you.
A little bit more…
…SOUND OF WAVES, AND AN EMPTY BEACH
Knock, knock.
Is everyone asleep?
Yeah.
In the end, Michael fell asleep while talking.
He really is full of energy.
Here.
Thanks.
Are you going to continue writing?
Yes.
I think I will until my dad completes his novel.
I see.
Make sure to write about me.
Of course.
You're going to be the main character.
Don't. I just want a small part.
I wanted to be with you
a little longer.
Where's this coming from?
I kind of…
liked you.
What's with that confession?
Is it weird?
Yes, it's weird.
I wonder if things would've been different if we met when we were alive.
I guess we'll never know.
Yeah.
Akira.
Thank you. It's been fun.
Me too.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Passing it to you now. Watch out behind you.
-Thank you. -What about this?
Right in the middle here.
All right. Yeah.
Wow, so many people.
Ryo.
-Long time no see. -Yeah.
We still have some time. You wanna go for tea?
Yeah, sure.
You've grown.
Thanks for coming.
First time in Tokyo? Yes.
There are so many people.
Yeah, compared to that place.
Right.
Are you graduating next year?
Yes.
Do you know what you want to do?
Well, I'm not completely sure.
But I might want to do what my mom did.
Please tell me about my mom again.
Sure. Of course.
I'm looking forward to the film today.
Yeah, please do.
Nana!
It's been a while.
Oh, hi!
Long time no see.
Hello.
Thumbs up!
Thumbs up!
Tickets please.
-This way. -Theater 2, please.
I'll see you later.
Enjoy.
I'm getting nervous.
in the minds of the consumers, a genre.
But it also is an art form,
and of all the art forms of animation,
to me, the most sacred and magical is stop-motion
because it's the bond between an animator and the puppet.
And normally, film captures reality.
Animation creates it and has to simulate the capture.
You give life to it, and that is the highest art form.
[man] What's gonna make us unique is
bringing Guillermo's live-action aesthetic to this movie.
There's a sophistication of filmmaking
that when it's applied to stop-motion, which is inherently handcrafted,
you get a really powerful combination.
[del Toro] Pinocchio is a movie that has a huge heart.
It deals with who you are, staying true to yourself,
and not having to change to be accepted.
It also is about being a father and being a son,
learning to love your family
for who they are and how they are.
Guillermo's Pinocchio is completely surprising.
He's able to Trojan horse these really big discussions
into a really entertaining family movie.
[woman] He is always looking at what it is to be human
and what it is to join a society.
That's his territory, and Pinocchio is all about that.
It's a retelling of a story you think you do know, but you don't know.
[del Toro] The outsider aspect of Pinocchio is what attracted me to the story.
I identify with outsider creatures
like the creature of Frankenstein or Pinocchio
and having to figure out the world on your own,
that the things that you are told are not enough.
And you want to know why this is right and why this is wrong
when this feels wrong and this feels right.
To me, there is a fragility to Pinocchio being otherworldly
and people being unable to see him as a real boy
because he doesn't look like what people think a real boy should look like.
I'm a real boy! [old man] Demon!
[woman] Witchcraft!
The magic is it's Guillermo's take on Pinocchio,
so the look of it is such a Guillermo film.
He's brought sort of the creature aspect into it
that you could only hope Guillermo would bring into Pinocchio.
But there's a real heartfelt,
sort of emotional side to the story as well.
Pinocchio!
Love hurts.
[del Toro] It took about 15 years to do Pinocchio,
and we had to assemble sort of the best team in stop-motion.
I call your attention to the miniature buttons.
-[Hayns] Yeah. -Damn, they're fine.
[Hayns laughs] They are, aren't they?
We did a three-way link between London, Portland, and Guadalajara.
I have been supporting Mexican animation since the '80s,
and we wanted to have a link with Mexico.
I wanted Mexican animators animating Pinocchio and the cricket.
Main characters because that demonstrates the great artistry and technical capacity
that a Mexican studio can have in animation.
We got some of the best animators in the world,
all under the guidance of Shadowmachine.
We embarked on an amazing process to build a stop-motion team
commensurate with the vision that Guillermo had.
[man] The depth of experience on our project was really great.
It's just tremendously exciting because,
you know, we get to be at the top of our game.
You know, we're always waiting for a script that sort of rises
to something that you want to service, and this is one of those experiences.
[man] The thing that immediately caught my attention
was that it didn't look like any animated film
you've ever seen before.
Guillermo's aesthetic is woven through almost every frame of this film.
[del Toro] There's a valuable difference between
stop-motion as an art form and digital.
We have seen a movement from stop-motion in the early days
where you had the moiré and the flicker of fur and fabric,
even the atmospheric dust on the sets,
and the imperfection of it was so gorgeous to look at
because it told you how the thing was done.
I really wanted this movie to land in a way
that had the material nature of a handmade piece of animation,
an artisanal, beautiful exercise in carving, painting, sculpting,
but it had the sophistication of movement
that research on rigs and puppetry making have taken us to.
[Hayns] So, you know, my role as the puppet fabrication supervisor,
it's really getting a director like Guillermo
to trust me with his image of his movie,
and then it's the practical element of
how do we turn these inanimate objects
into fully animatable puppets?
[man] We have to plan out a lot of how it's going to move,
what it needs to do within the arc of its story.
You know, what is it going to need to be rigged on,
and how much does it weigh? That's even a thing we have to consider.
It's a tough balance, especially when it comes to creatures,
which are certainly more cumbersome than a human character.
You've got so many fantastical, wonderful elements
that each and every one of them is hard to do,
but you have to put it together and make it work together.
[Gustafson] It's a very long process getting a puppet ready.
You know, it might take a year
to get to where you've got a finished puppet that everyone's happy with, and it can actually go out on stage,
that everyone's happy with, and it can actually go out on stage, and then you can animate it.
[Hayns] Guillermo really wanted this to be mechanical
rather than replacement.
We have both puppets in this movie.
Replacement is every mouth shape and every expression
being a transplant.
So, its every mouth shape is a separate face mask
that sits on the puppet's face.
Pinocchio is replacement because he's a wooden boy.
[man] So, we made him act like he was made out of wood.
His face stays the same size at all times.
He doesn't have any puffy cheeks.
The wood grains in his face doesn't move around at all.
It just opens up.
I sort of described it as using a chisel to open the mouth up.
So, you just go it in one bang. There's a bit of cushion on the back end.
Bang! Open.
I think that was a stroke of genius when we all came up with that.
I was like, "Yes!"
[man] Technically speaking, it was gonna be a really difficult puppet to create.
We had to find new techniques so that you could see the character
in all its wooden form with its crude wooden joints.
We wanted it to be as practical and as durable
as a feature film would demand of a puppet of that size.
Pinocchio himself is the first puppet
fully printed out of a 3D printer.
But then Volpe and Geppetto are all mechanical.
A mechanical animation is where you have a silicone skin
sitting over what is essentially a Swiss watch of mechanisms.
With that, the animator move frame-by-frame
every element from the outside through the skin.
It's been a long process working with the animation team
to see how we would develop the techniques used for each character.
[Hayns] You know, Geppetto works so well
because he's got a big mustache and a big beard and heavy eyebrows.
And all of these things lend themselves to mechanical faces.
So, when the animator started to work with the first Carlo puppet,
it was such a struggle.
[del Toro] The more smooth the face,
the harder it is to make those expressions change.
So, the animators started relying on the lower eyelids,
on the brows, on the body language.
And especially with Carlo,
one of the things we wanted to do was
do unnecessary gestures in animation.
This was an ambassador to that
because nobody does more unnecessary gestures than a child.
[Campodonico] One of Guillermo's initial conceits was really making sure that you hold on
to the realness and the tactileness of stop-motion
and the idea that you animate mistakes.
[man] He was really stressing the realism of the performances
like little mistakes that people make all the time.
If they go to pick up a dinner plate, they maybe miss it
and go for it again.
[del Toro] In live-action, you beg for a mistake,
you beg for a line reading that is not what you expected.
This invoking of reality is very hard in stop-motion
because you are animating it, so you need to simulate those accidents.
Lift your leg.
Because he's a live-action director,
he understands the time it takes for people to process
faces and things on screen.
On this film, Guillermo really has taken the time to say it needs to get slowed down.
We need to see Pinocchio thinking about that.
I said, "If the character is thinking,
I wanna see the eyes inputting the information."
"I want to see a subtle shift."
If you animate the ordinary, you will achieve something extraordinary.
I co-directed with Mark Gustafson, who, for me, is
a legendary director and animator.
It's been amazing working with Guillermo because
he's an artist who's at the top of his game right now.
So, it makes you have to raise your game as well.
Guillermo's been fantastic in the way that he completely trusted the animator,
a bit like he trusts his actors.
[del Toro] Basically, the way you do a live-action is between action and cut,
the actor owns the shot.
And you make this bond with the animators,
and it gives them a lot of power to think through the puppet,
to not do an action, to avoid pantomime,
and to give us real acting.
The animators are our actors.
Animation is such an elaborate process, and we wanted animators to own the performances.
and we wanted animators to own the performances.
One of the founding principles
that Guillermo and I came up with when we started this was
give the performance back to the animators as much as possible.
Part of that is them shooting these what we call LAVs, live-action videos.
[Geppetto] Do not tell lies or your nose will grow and grow…
[Hansen] Most times before you do a shot as an animator, you would go and investigate
what kind of shape this shot is gonna have,
what kind of motion, what kind of speed.
A good and quick way to do that is just film yourself.
So, the animator would turn up with a little video of themself doing the action.
Guillermo really loved that.
Every time he sees them, he's, like, a big smile and going, "Yeah!"
"Just like that! It's great!"
[snaps fingers] Spazzatura.
[del Toro] Gris Grimly designed an amazing Pinocchio.
To me, the best Pinocchio I've seen because it's so simple and so beautiful.
[man] When I started illustrating Pinocchio,
I just wanted him to be lanky and awkward
like a puppet without the strings.
[man] Designing Pinocchio was the main character
we wanted to get down first.
Guillermo had the wonderful idea of it being almost Frankenstein-like
in that one half is finished and one is unfinished.
[del Toro] We made him asymmetrical
because Geppetto carves him when he's drunk.
And one of the ideas is he starts with the ear and this hair,
and he's really careful with that, and then he goes, "Ah."
And kind of finishes him quick.
Geppetto was the one character that we designed the most.
We layered him out on clothing.
We made it a point to make everything he was wearing ratty.
You know, he's not a guy that can afford many pairs of pants.
[Geppetto sobs] My son.
We have to take him to a place where he's not pleasant.
I mean, this guy drinks. This guy gets angry.
This guy doesn't understand Pinocchio.
It takes him a while to realize that
his love for this boy is much more important
than doing what is socially acceptable.
Even if he's dead, I could still book him.
How dare you, sir? Show some respect!
[del Toro] The main villain in Collodi's stories, a character called Mangiafuoco,
is a very large character,
and I had a bad feeling about it. I didn't like it. I thought it was very much a cliché.
Guillermo called whoever was working on the show at that point,
and he looked at us, and he said, "Hey, guys."
"I think our main villain is crap, and I want to change it."
[del Toro] And I said, "I really think this should be the guy."
"Can we make him the main antagonist?"
And that was just, "Okay. All right. We've already built the villain."
-[laughing] So, what do we do? -[talking over each other]
So, what was your answer to his question?
It was one of those moments where once you see it, you can't unsee it,
and you work with the amazing team to figure it out.
[Hayns] There was a lot of time that was spent designing Mangiafuoco
with a huge beard, and this puppet,
we finished making him, and he's now a background character for the circus.
Go away! This is not a spectacle.
But it is!
Volpe is one of the more over-the-top characters.
He's really fun because he's kind of the devil.
He's very transactional. He's just what's best for him.
One last detail to take care of.
[del Toro] When we were thinking about the cricket
I was thinking of a cricket that has traveled all over the world,
and lived with a sculptor and a barrister.
And I thought of the name
Sebastian J. Cricket.
That sounded so sophisticated.
[Gustafson] Cricket was really driven by Guillermo.
He takes this character who is a little bit arrogant,
and he makes you really like him and want to follow him.
[del Toro] The animation on the cricket is very simple in appearance,
but that means you have to be very judicious with that.
He uses the hands a lot
to explain, to…
You know, he's very righteous.
So, he uses the hands to demand an explanation,
to accuse somebody,
to signal.
He's a character that uses his whole body as a face.
[Cricket] I'm not a governess, madam.
And then, you know, it's a creature design which is a completely different thing,
and that is Guillermo's true wheelhouse.
[del Toro] The dogfish, Death, the sprite,
the cricket, the rabbits
all have the same unworldly blue violet skin
because they are all related.
The rabbits take the dead to the other side.
And they're an extension of Death, which is the sister of life,
which is the sprite.
The concept art was never clean or stylized. It wasn't a very polished looking like… look to a character.
They would have dirt under their fingernails.
They would have, you know, blemishes,
and it was like he wanted every character to feel like it lived a life
before in the film.
[Saunders] You know, we would create a character,
uh, make a beautiful costume, you know, for Geppetto
or one of the other characters,
and you get a message back.
Guillermo's seen it.
It's gotta look dirty. [chuckles]
You see, you make a beautiful puppet,
but it looks like it's come straight out of the shop when you finish it.
It doesn't look like it's a character in a story.
[del Toro] You don't have to believe they are real people.
You have to believe in them as characters,
and we wanted to embody the form and the character into one.
We wanted to fuse them.
Volpe with his sort of demonic, horn-like wings on the hair.
The innocence of Pinocchio, his simplicity.
The sort of earthiness and beautiful old-world grace in Geppetto.
We wanted to do a labor of design that told the story.
[Cricket] Stridulations of My Youth by Sebastian J. Cricket.
[del Toro] In terms of scale,
we use different size of puppets for different needs.
This is our Pinocchio to interact with the cricket, which is this height,
Sebastian J. Cricket.
And in order for him to be the right size in very few shots,
we need the cricket and the shoulder of Pinocchio
talking to him, whispering in his ear. So, we use this big Pinocchio.
And then in certain shots, we use this small Pinocchio.
Then we have this
small crickets
for other shots, particularly when he gets crushed.
The pain.
[Gustafson] You can only build a puppet so small
and still have good control over it in terms of the animation.
So we built Pinocchio as small as we could and still
So we built Pinocchio as small as we could and still have really good control over him.
And then everybody else's scale is in relation to that.
And then the sets are in relation to that.
[Enderle] Everything has to be built.
That's sort of the blessing and the curse of stop-motion.
You know, you can make things look exactly as you need them to look.
I think that's exciting
because you fully create a world
and a world that's unlike any other or very much like another.
And that's kind of really powerful. It helps you best tell the story.
So we looked at a lot of Guillermo's films and picked up key things.
Colors, textures,
shapes of windows, and just general atmosphere.
You can probably tell within three seconds that you're watching a Guillermo film,
and we wanted that to be true of this.
[Bradley] The sets are evocative
of the beauty of these little Italian towns,
and I know places just like this.
[del Toro] We did a huge amount of research.
Photographs and posters, we copied typography
because I wanted the world to feel real.
All the structures in the town
have the remnants of their origins
like medieval ruins, and then on top of that
like medieval ruins, and then on top of that you have 18th-century carvings,
and then you have murals that were frescoes from the 1500s, 1400s.
So, it feels layered.
[man] Once you're translating script to storyboards,
those decisions can define how massive the vision can be,
and you can make choices in story where you put the camera,
how much the camera's moving.
[Gustafson] One of the unique challenges that we have is
the animator has to actually be able to get in
and reach the puppets and animate.
So, we have to design these sets
so that they can be pulled apart in many different ways.
It's all a big, like, teamwork, and we're all sitting there together
talking about how this is gonna look.
The film looks a certain way,
and then the animation needs to fit into that world as well.
[Gustafson] Early on, you have to find out the aesthetic,
like exactly what it is.
And we'll base it on something very simple.
You know, we have a pine cone in the movie that,
it's a… it's a charming little… little object,
and we looked at it over and over for months at different intervals,
and we would look at other things through the lens of
like how did we make this pine cone? We like this look.
If you know how the lines of a simple, organic pine cone works,
you start to learn the line language
and the level of detail and the level of reality
that we're trying to infuse into this movie.
You just kind of get a feel for what this world looks like.
[DeSue] The Death puppet left room for certain aspects to be explored.
Yeah. 'Cause I mean, I think originally the Death, we had the snake tail,
and it was you and Toby
saw that scaling as a pine cone texture. And that was so brilliant.
It was a great way of tying it into the pine cone that Death represented
every living thing.
[Gustafson] There were some pants for Spazzatura. And the line in the pants…
-Had to be handmade. -It had to be handmade.
But it didn't wanna be overt, you know.
It wanted to feel real in a sense,
but it sort of reflected into everything else,
this notion of it's not perfect.
It's got a character to it.
[DeSue] We'd all seen the sample. It had come from Mackinnon and Saunders.
They gave us a swatch board. If we can handle these stripes nine ways.
Here's ones that we like, and we were all, "That one."
And we laughed. We're like, "We all agree."
"That's so great. It must be that one."
Then the next step was to talk about well, why?
Because if you talk about why, then maybe those rules can inform other things.
[Death] There are rules, you see.
[Gustafson] We had to find the language of it, how cartoony is it, how real is it.
And there was sort of a sweet spot I think we landed in.
Having a magical element like Pinocchio
required that we had a more grounded world around Pinocchio.
If everything is magical, nothing is magical.
We needed to ground the world. Proportions needed to be correct.
The physics needed to be correct.
It provided stakes for the emotional story and arc of Pinocchio.
Guillermo has a very good eye for that.
He notices when something is not going to fit into the world.
[del Toro] This is no different than designing
and decorating a full-size,
live-action movie set.
That's the beauty of stop-motion animation.
Set dec, set design, decoration,
cinematography, they're completely like a live-action film.
Guillermo's very concerned that things feel and look real.
And so we do reference a lot of period images if we can find them.
[del Toro] For example, this interior.
If you imagined that the main source of energy was coal
and wood, we stained all the walls with coal stains.
So you have to really run it not by a design machine,
but as a reality machine.
[Enderle] I remember one of his first visits. He was looking at the church set
that we had just sort of barely gotten together by the time he got here,
and he was like, "Yes. We should age the hell out of this." [chuckles]
[del Toro] We started with the fact that churches took decades, if not centuries
to be completed.
So, the woodwork would be a little lighter than the frescoes on the walls,
or the stained-glass windows would be of a different decade or a century,
and the carving of the Christ took a while.
It needed to feel like the same handiwork
of all the other stuff in Geppetto's household.
You needed to feel the shaving of the wood, the shape,
which I wanted to have a parallel with Pinocchio being carved of wood
and Pinocchio has a hard time figuring out
why the townspeople hate him
if he's made of wood and they love Him,
as he says, who is also made of wood.
So, that point could only be done at the church.
My only worry on this movie was
will I have enough motion control kit
to do all the camera movement that Guillermo will expect on this movie.
Because the later Guillermo films, the camera just doesn't stop.
[del Toro] We wanted to stage with the characters moving around on the camera,
moving around the way you would stage with actors on a set.
In some instances, we move the camera quite a bit.
For example, one single shot took three months.
[Passingham] There's a shot where Spazzatura is headed back to the carnival
where he sort of runs down, and the camera follows him
traversing the carnival grounds
and ending up in Volpe's wagon.
[Passingham] A shot like that, it tells you so much
'cause you really see the way that Spazzatura moves.
It tells you something about his character.
It also tells you about the environment that he's from.
It tells you about the circus. And we also get to meet some of the other characters
who are in the background as he sort of passes through.
A lot of Guillermo's movies are hyperreality.
So, you use the light
just to accent the emotional content of a scene,
so having some cloud movement is such an assist for telling the story.
Like with Geppetto when he is chopping down the tree.
It helps to reflect Geppetto's agonized state,
so we can really amp up the drama.
One of the things which we had not done before
was when Volpe is burning Pinocchio on the fire.
We were able to have a torch with LED lights inside the torch,
so that as Volpe moves the torch around,
we were able to have a separate pass for that light
and to give it multiple exposures.
Give me that torch, Spazzatura.
Because normally, you'd always have to fake that up with moving lights or stage,
and this was an opportunity for us to really control that in the post process.
We could keep the moonlight separate
and just have all of that torch light and fire light
on separate passes.
You will burn. Burn bright!
Like a star!
-[Volpe laughs evilly] -[Pinocchio] Ow! Help!
[Hayns] It's amazing how the character designs and the actors themselves
inform each other,
and then the actual animator informs it as well.
By the time that the animator gets the puppet,
the animator has the voice tracks.
[del Toro] The thing with Pinocchio that I love
is the idea of it embodying
any four-year-old, six-year-old that are balls of energy
-that nobody can control. -[Cricket] Oh!
[del Toro] When they're sad, you understand they're sad, and they can be on the verge of tears one second
and incredibly happy two seconds later.
As we came to find out with Gregory,
you have a very short lifespan in the recording sessions, but it was all true.
[boy] My process at the beginning, I was very nervous.
I've never done
anything where I was a really big, substantial part in the movie.
It was like shooting a documentary.
Whenever he started acting,
we did a little thing that… [chuckles]
…it was very easy for him to shake out the acting.
I said… I would say he would call me a dummy.
He said that if I said "dummy" at the end of a line,
even though we wouldn't probably put it in the final cut,
it made me put a lot more emphasis into it,
especially on some of the funnier lines.
And every time he got a little too actory,
he would say, "Shut up, dummy!"
And then he would laugh it out, and he would continue.
I'm made of flesh and bone and meaty bits.
I'm a real boy.
He's really good at being natural,
but he is incredibly intimate when he's whispering
or talking to the cricket
or talking to Candlewick.
There is an absolute pure emotion there.
Fathers feel despair, like everyone else.
And they say things they only think they mean in the moment.
But inside they love you.
[del Toro] Well, I think this is my third project with David Bradley,
and it's because I admire him very much.
I think he's an actor that has an easily identifiable sound.
No one talks to the Podestà like that.
I approached the script by finding some kind of vocal quality
that was believable and truthful,
[grittier voice] but something that tells the story and it's more vivid
and more capturing
the essence of this character.
He goes high, and he goes low really fast. [imitating] "Why are you saying that?"
You know, he really is…
It's almost like a musical thing he has.
A son knows when his father is alive.
He will look for us. You'll see.
You have nothing to worry about. [coughs]
I wasn't convinced of Cricket when we started the film.
Just as a character.
As soon as Ewan started voicing it, I was like, "Okay. I'm on board."
I can't believe it!
[del Toro] I'm a massive fan of Ewan McGregor,
and when he talks, he's so relatable but warm.
And I said, "We cannot have enough of this voice."
Well, I've tried my best, and that's the best anyone can do.
Pinocchio taught me that.
And I thought that should be the main character of the film,
the narrator character.
And we rewrote the scenes emphasizing the cricket
even if he was just watching.
I think the sessions with Ewan have been the best character voice sessions
I've ever had in my life.
I am Count Volpe. You have been chosen!
Come partake in the fun, fanciful, carefree carnival life
as the star of my puppet show.
[del Toro] We knew that Volpe needed to be glitzy, cosmopolitan, appealing,
sound like a man of the world.
We wanted him to have an accent,
but have a voice that could pronounce flawlessly
a word in French, a word in Italian, a word in German.
Puppets are le meilleur qui soit. The tops!
Puppets are le meilleur qui soit. The tops! Lift your arm.
Puppets are well respected in every station of life.
The only voice that came to mind was Christoph Waltz.
Talk about a guy that can change
the rhythm and the intention of a sound in mid-phrase.
[Waltz] That's a dramatic function, so to say.
And I always look for the function in the story.
He really knows how to vary things and then just punch at the right moment.
-[clattering] -What are you doing here?
The voice of Spazzatura, which will come as a big surprise,
was almost a blessing and an accident that I could not foresee.
We were shooting Nightmare Alley. Cate Blanchett and I were having such a good time
that she said, "You gotta give me a part on Pinocchio."
I go, "The only part left is a monkey."
And I went, "I would do anything."
"I would play a pencil in a movie for you."
[del Toro] And I showed her the design for Spazzatura, and she said,
"I think this is my spirit animal."
When Spazzatura gets shot out of the sky, do you want a little [squeaky moan].
Like in the distance.
I think there's something of Guillermo's laugh… [chuckles deeply] …that's in Spazzatura.
But I think all the characters in Guillermo's movies,
all of us feel that they're in the eye of Guillermo as the beholder.
So, I think there's probably qualities of Guillermo
in all of the characters. And Spazzatura is, yeah, case in point.
[Pinocchio singing] ♪ Ciao, Papa Mio papa… ♪
[Blanchett] Normally, when you're watching a piece of animation
which has music in it,
you can feel the songs coming up.
It's almost like the dialogue is a ramp for the music.
♪ No one knows, no one can tell… ♪
[Blanchett] Whereas the songs spring out of Guillermo's Pinocchio
completely by surprise.
These puppets gave me the desire of not
doing an animation movie, but doing like a real live-action film.
It's the same for me 'cause they look alive.
They all look like real people.
So, I tried the music to be playing like it was a real person's.
We like to describe this not necessarily as a musical.
It's a film with musical moments.
They're not traditional musical songs, they're not pop songs.
They're just sort of what you would think of, if you think
of Alexandre and Guillermo and Mark.
All those genius minds together is something totally unique.
When Alexandre and I were talking, I thought it would be interesting
to start the movie with characters that sing
but end up…
The second half of the movie has fascist-era songs and marches.
This movie was a very long process because, of course, the animation takes a lot of time,
but also because
Guillermo wanted me to write songs for the characters,
and a song has this capacity
in a few seconds to explain the life of a character.
They give the tone musically.
Also, they give information about who they are, where they are,
where they come from, and where they're going.
I admire Alexandre Desplat.
He is a consummate movie composer.
He does the same thing that I do with parts.
He looks at the story.
[Desplat] For the whole film, I've chosen to use only wood instruments.
So, you have the guitars, the mandolin,
the piano, the harp, and all the woodwinds.
The bassoons, the clarinets, the oboes, the flutes.
All these instruments are in wood
which creates a very strange environment that belongs to Pinocchio.
No!
[del Toro] This movie, you could watch in a double program
with Pan's and Devil's Backbone easily.
It has a lot of elements with a pure soul being tested
and coming out on the other side strong.
[Death] As I see it, you were charged with a burden.
This is a film about death.
You don't have a film about life if you don't have a film about death.
[Wood Sprite] Very well then.
[del Toro] When we started to tackle this Pinocchio,
I knew I wanted to do my own version.
I didn't want to address just an adaptation.
I wanted to talk about things that touched me personally very deeply.
Most of my movies, one way or another, deal with me and my father,
and this is not an exception.
[Froud] You watch this boy grow up, never physically changing.
But yet, the realization that he can do far more than anyone else around him.
[Death] Now, make the most of it.
[del Toro] Normally, Pinocchio is about what Pinocchio learns in the world
and then becomes a good boy and therefore becomes a real boy,
and our Pinocchio is not that.
He changes everyone because he is so pure.
He changes Geppetto. He changes the cricket.
He changes Spazzatura. He changes everyone.
And he learns who he is as a human being.
I think the film exceeded everything I wanted.
It's a movie I would've loved to have as a kid.
It's a movie I'd love to have as an adult.
It's a movie I would love to have to discuss with the family,
and the possibility of seeing it on command
after experiencing it for the first time,
it's something that creates an intimate bond
between the viewer and the film.
PEOPLE, PLACES, AND EPOCHS.
THE EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS MOVIE ARE FICTITIOUS.

JUST A SECOND. I'M GETTING OFF FROM THE MRT.
IF YOU'RE NOT HERE IN 10 MINUTES, I'M LEAVING.
HOLD ON. I'LL GIVE YOU A DISCOUNT ON ANY PIECE YOU LIKE.
Has this house been sold already?
Yes.
I didn't get a good price for it.
But I don't know why I'd keep it.
But this one, Noon.
It's the gun of Luang Awutwiset.
My family heirloom.
From Rama III era.
He was the owner of Thailand's first department store.
Here. Take a look at this.
Noon.
Do you see this wooden box in this photo?
It's the same one.
This is a picture of the grandparents of my great-great-great grandma.
If you want it, I'll throw in this picture too.
They're your ancestors.
Keep it to pay respects.
As for the gun…
LUANG AWUTWISET
I'll give you 500,000.
Well, that sounds okay, but…
let me go talk with my mom first.
She's really possessive of it.
Tell your mom I can go up to 600,000.
650,000 then.
MRS. LEELAWADEE HUNTRAKUL
Mom.
I know the gun has a long history.
But, he really is giving a great price, Mom.
It's enough to buy a car.
But, if you're not okay,
then send me a signal.
Whether it be a strong wind, thunder, or make something fall.
You're okay with it?
Well…
I'm going to sell it then.
What?
What?
What?
Come on.
Why?

The newsletter stated this.
This means the Express
is close to arriving to Siam, am I right, sir?
Sir.
Sir.
I just bought this from a Chinese merchant at the market.
Father Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix.
Could you please pay attention to what I'm saying, sir?
Sure.
Come take a look at this, Miss Gaysorn.
What language is this?
It's not Khmer.
I'm not sure if it's Siamese.
Take a look. Can you read it or not?
They're Siamese characters, sir.
But it's written in a strange manner.
"My name is Ketsurang."
"I'm a fourth-year archeology student."
"I'm a bit on the plus-size kind of girl."
"And in the year of 2018 C.E.,
I traveled back in time…"
"I'm now in the body of Lady Karaket,
the most beautiful…
just like Miss Grand…
Ayutthaya!"
"Ayutthaya…"
Must mean the city Ayutthaya.
But, "traveled back in time…"
What does this mean, sir?
"Darn. Freaking cool."
"Dej got promoted
to Khun Sriwisarnwaja."
This journal is very interesting indeed.
Will you please study it and tell me about it later?
Yes, sir.
Dej!
Karaket, my love.
Are thou secretly writing about me?
This is my personal journal. You aren't allowed to read it.
No!
Bhop.
Are you awake yet, son?
Not yet, Mother.
Then who is it that is answering me?
I think it's time for you to meet your fiancée.
You've been stalling for years.
You have never seen her in person.
Do you remember?
Your father had tied your lifeline with Gaysorn's.
If you both marry each other, your lives will continue on.
But if not…
Either you or Gaysorn will die.
The lifeline will be cut.
If it is you who were to die, then how could I continue to live?
I intended to go meet my betrothed today anyway.

You should have sent word that you were coming.
Today, Gaysorn isn't at home.
She's gone to study at the church since the early morning.
It's a pity that the two of you have not met yet.
That's all right, sir.
I'm here to meet with you, actually.
Four years ago,
my parents and you
verbally betrothed Gaysorn and I to each other.
However, I was engaged with work.
I had to build the main temple at Prib Pri city.
When I came back to the capital,
I had to construct the pagoda at Prayun Temple.
Thus I never had the chance to meet with Gaysorn.
I…
would like to ask to…
break off our engagement.
I don't find it amusing, Pi.
Next time I'll take you to see something more amusing.
What is it, miss?
A steamboat from England. It's made entirely of steel,
but it floats in water.
Miss.
Any ship is the same.
Let's watch the play.
This Prince's royal performing ensemble is the best ensemble in the capital, miss.
How can you like this?
Phra Aphai Mani is ever the ladies' man.
If I wrote the story, I'd have the giantess eat him.
Will you please be quiet?
I can't understand what's going on.
Who is it?
Just some man.
He's good-looking, but his brows are knitted together.
He seems to be a regular here, miss.
Tell him to cover his ears.
Cover your ears, sir.
Tell the person next to you to cover her mouth.
How rude.
People are watching the show.
Let's go home, Pi.
I've got chills.
Yes, miss.
What is thy name?
Who are thy parents? Where is thy residence?
Why are you using the word "thy"?
You sound so ancient.
Then by what name shall I call thee?
I haven't learned thy name yet.
My name is Viola. My sister's name is Fiddle.
Our mother's name is Violin.
Our father's name is Cello. We're a string ensemble.
You two are good at fiddling around.
And for what reason is thy sister dressed as a helper?
My sister likes to disguise herself.
That's right.
Or else we won't be able to leave the house.
Men are waiting to kidnap me as I am quite the beauty.
Then thou must not have disguised thyself.
Seeing as thou art as beautiful as the sunset.
Let me tell you something for your own good.
My lady is already betrothed.
He's a Chief-ranking official.
Is he Mis-Chief or Handker-Chief?
Chief Sombatbordi.
Thou art Gaysorn?
The daughter of the Police Colonel?
How do you know?
I am…
Chief Sombatbordi.
You're my fiancé?
Yes.
This morning I just went to thy house.
Did you arrange for the wedding day already?
I went to…
…break off our engagement.
How could you say such a thing?
If you do not wed
and if Gaysorn's lifeline is cut off,
who will be responsible?
I will not allow you to break off the engagement.
I will not allow it, no matter what!
But I want to.
At first, I also wanted to.
But…
…I have my eye on someone else, sir.
Even if I must die,
I really am not able to wed Gaysorn.
I despise men
who do not keep their promises.
You must be hiding mistresses away in the other cities.
It's good that my daughter will not have you as her husband!
Madam.
You say such things about my son…
And what about your daughter?
What woman
dresses up and styles her hair in such a peculiar way?
Why does she not wear her hair like the other women?
All she does is study foreign subjects.
Such a peculiar woman as her is not wife material.
That's why you tied her fortune with my son!
Then you best mind the life of your son.
Who knows when his time will come?
It's your daughter who must be careful.
I'll be waiting to see whose child will be the first to go!
Hey! Just tell me if the engagement is broken off or not?
That's enough.
If you want to break off the engagement, then do so.
Don't you ever show your face around here again.
Don't even dare to row your boat past my pier!
Please tell me that thou art Viola.
The daughter of Cello.
You've been building temples for many years,
yet you don't have enough blessings.
Oh, destiny…
Why are you so mean to me?
My destiny must be like Usaren,
whom Pra Aphai Mani stole his fiancé away from him.
It's not the same.
How so?
Usaren had his fiancé taken from him, but you're just a plain fool.
You broke up with her first.
Uncle Phu, you wrote this story.
Then you can change the ending.
Make Usaren reunite with Suwanmali.
Rewrite it now.
So the dancers can rehearse the new dance.
If I changed it, people would burn down my house.
This is Phra Aphai Mani's story.
The protagonist has to win it all.
What now?
Uncle, you just went treasure hunting.
Did you get any magical items
that can help me get re-engaged to Gaysorn?
Well…
You know everything.
Take your pick then.
Every piece is sacred and magical.
No. This one you can't have.
It's off limits.
This is the Krishna-Kali scripture.
According to ancient records,
it's used to put curses on people who think and does evil.
If they are cursed using these chants, they will die.
Uncle Phu.
Is there any magical item that will turn back time?
I want to go back to four years ago.
And I would not go anywhere else.
I would rush to see Gaysorn quickly.
All right.
There's only one way.
You need to use this.
My nipple?
Your heart!
Goodness.
Be careful, miss.
Chuen, row as fast as you can.
Yes, miss.
You can go home first.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to the church.
Pi.
What shall I do to not see this smiling face again?
He hovers around just like a fly.
Miss.
Let's do this.
We have to make the Chief see that you are a wicked person.
Self-centered, unpredictable, fussy, and bossy.
Wait.
Is this a plan or your inner thoughts?
Oh, miss, the Chief is looking at us.
You have to slap me, miss.
Let him see that you slap your help for no reason.
What?
Quickly. Just slap me.
I can't do that.
I love you just like a sister.
Miss! Slap me.
You want that Smiley as your…
Pi.
He didn't see it.
Slap me again.
I think we should change the method.
Slap now!
Miss, slapping isn't enough.
You have to scold me really badly and very loudly for the Chief to hear.
I can't. I think it's enough.
If it's going to be this tough, it'd be better to just be honest with him.
Just scold me!
Spew out any curses.
The Chief must hate and fear you.
I can't do it!
You have to!
You must…
Pi, you!
-Chief. He is watching… -Chucklehead!
Ratbag!
You wench!
Pi.
Did the Chief see it?
I think he did, miss.
Dost thou study here?
You fool!
Take this artifact away.
I'm going to go study!
Buffoon!
Do you want to change sides?
The same side is better.
Leave the other one for me to chew, please.
-You! -I know thou art pretending.
Sir.
Where is the chest that keeps the Lady's journal?
I'm going to continue studying.
This man is your destiny. Am I right?
The fiancé you wish to never meet.
What?
Dej-ti-ny?
Sir.
The chest, please.
I heard that you have built many temples.
Oh, yes, sir.
Sir.
May I have the key to the chest, please?
Key?
Oh, the key.
I guess I forgot it in my room.
I better go get it.
Art thou mad that I broke off our engagement?
Stop calling me thou.
Who uses that word anymore? So strange.
Oh, if thou dost not want me to call thee thou,
what dost thou want me to call thee then?
Dost thou know?
I have dreamed of thee for so many years.
We are absolutely destined to be together.
Had I known that thou were betrothed to me,
I would not have ever broken off the engagement.
Dost thou loathe me
to the point thou will not turn to look at me?
I'm not mad that you broke off the engagement
because I never wanted to be engaged to you.
I used our engagement as an excuse to continue my studies here.
Pallegoix has been kind enough to teach me.
I hadn't planned to study for long.
But now I can speak English well.
Four years! Where have you been?
Is it that you're plain rude or do you disdain me?
Which is why you never came to meet me?
Oh, no. I apologize.
I'm sorry for letting thee wait so long.
May I ask for us to be engaged once more?
Do you believe we are destined to be together?
If so, could you wait?
Of course.
No matter how long, I will wait.
Wait until our next life then.
THE BRITISH FACTORY
ROYAL TREASURY PIER
Miss.
Take it easy.
If you fall into the water, it'll be a big mess.
Pi, hurry.
Rumor has it that angels built it, so this iron ship can float in water.
A monk's alms bowl can also float in water.
You're so gullible.
The ship is enormous, just as rumored, Mr. Hunter.
The bill of sale.
Wasn't the price you gave at first at 50,000 dollars?
Why has the price increased to 67,000?
The ship was stranded in a storm in Singapore,
Minister of the Royal Treasury.
Therefore, it had to use more coal.
I didn't raise the price without any reason.
Siam ordered this steamboat to wage war with Cochinchina.
But now the war is nearing an end.
This iron ship of yours is…
beautiful…
Absolutely beautiful.
Chief Sombatbordi.
Go wash your face to sober up.
And quickly inspect the steamboat now.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Hunter.
Let's go talk inside.
Miss!
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
My goodness. How did this happen?
Be careful. Come, miss.
Are you all right?
I'm not hurt…
Hey!
Are you in pain?
No.
But I'm afraid of blood.
What to do?
Let me do it, miss.
Here.
Darn. Freakin' cool.
DARN. FREAKIN' COOL.
Here.
Let me help you.
Oh, dear.
You are all sweaty as if you lost your hand.
Let's get up, miss.
Let's go. You got all dirty.
Are you all right?
Is this yours?
Oh, yes.
Thank you for picking it up for me.
Who are you?
Why did you bring a pistol here?
Chief.
You're not the police.
You don't have the authority to arrest anyone.
Let him go right now.
But this is the Royal Treasury's area.
I have the authority to interrogate strangers who bring in a weapon.
What is your relation to Gaysorn?
Why were you smiling so sweetly at each other?
Chief!
You're not my fiancé anymore. Don't act like this.
If you're going to interrogate him, do it now.
"Luang Awutwiset."
That's the title given to Mr. Hunter.
This pistol isn't yours.
My name is Mathus.
I've been working at Hunter's British Factory for three years.
Don't you lie to me.
Someone with your looks, could work with Westerners?
What did he say?
He's Hunter's assistant.
He's good at what he does.
Hunter gave him the gun as a present.
This is a royal gift bestowed by the King.
There's no way Hunter would give it away.
You stole it, didn't you?
What?
Chief!
What is this?
Did you smuggle it over the border?
These are called sunglasses.
Hard material as such must be a weapon
for throwing at people, correct?
No.
It's not a weapon.
It's a mobile phone.
"Mobile phone"?
I'm not a thief.
It's my duty to inspect the steamboat today.
All right. I will let you go.
But I will keep all of these things to ask Mr. Hunter about them first.
But the pistol is broken…
Do you want to leave or go to prison with this pistol of yours?
Go.
Move.
Go.
Hello, Ma'am.
Wow!
It smells so nice and looks so good.
What curry did you cook?
"Wary" curry.
Beef "wary" curry.
Mother asked me to come and apologize
to you for saying things she shouldn't have.
I also have something that's hard to find.
It's grape juice from abroad, ma'am.
It strangely burns my throat.
Are you sure this is grape juice?
Ma'am.
But it has medicinal benefits.
Ever since Mother drank this grape juice,
when the night falls, Father has not gotten any sleep.
Can I have another glass?
Sure, ma'am.
Refreshing.
Ma'am.
I won't have any.
Just a little.
To boost your blood circulation
and have the strength to rock the boat all night long.
What?
Have you come back already?
Bhop, my dear son.
Bhop, my dear master-to-be.
Where is your lady?
Yes!
I've been looking for you!
What art thou looking for?
The pistol, of course.
Don't stare at me. I won't be swayed.
Move back.
Shoot me.
So I can die and I will wait for thee in the next life.
I'm the Police Colonel's daughter. Don't think I won't dare.
I know that thou dare to.
But, it doesn't have any bullets.
That's my pistol.
CHIEF SOMBATBORDI
That person with the strange name told thee to steal the pistol back?
Thou art quiet.
This means thou admit.
I will tell the police to arrest
that guy with the strange name.
His name…
I want the pistol you took from the man whose name is Mathus…
Mathus!
To trade with something.
Just tell us the truth.
And he will return everything to you.
I saw the word "mobile phone" in Lady Karaket's journal,
which was written in King Narai's time.
"Let me complain a bit."
"I really miss Mom and Grandma."
"It'd be great if I had my mobile phone here."
Lady Karaket called this journal Records of Ket's Krungsri.
She wrote the records for the next generation
to know what will happen to our country.
Did she write what year she came from?
2018 C.E.
I'm from 2021,
which is 177 years from now.
This pistol took me back in time here.
I was surprised and flipped out.
I asked locals where the MRT was.
They must have thought I was a foreigner,
so they took me to Hunter's British Factory.
When Lady Sap,
Mr. Hunter's wife found out I could speak English,
she put me to work at the store.
I usually sold things online in my time.
Oh, in simple words,
I was kind of a merchant, so it's not hard for me.
Shortly, Mr. Hunter entrusted me…
to become his right-hand man.
What?
Oh, I mean…
I was promoted to his assistant, overseeing the sales for him sometimes.
I then realized
that I came back to the time of my ancestors.
My family name is Huntrakul.
Well…
it's likely to originate from Hunter.
Family name?
Is it like Westerners' surname?
Let's say you married me.
Your full name would be Gaysorn Huntrakul.
Hey!
You can't say such things.
It's not proper.
All right then.
Let's say you were my son.
Your name would be
Bhop Huntrakul.
Gosh!
There's no way I will ever be your child.
So?
Why are you wasting your time smelling the flowers here?
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
I've tried doing so.
For the past three years,
I haven't told anyone about traveling back in time.
I fired the pistol at Prayun Temple so many times…
without any success.
Because there's one thing that isn't the same.
The solar eclipse.
Rahu swallowing the sun?
Oh, yes.
Rahu swallowing the sun.
But…
I don't know when Rahu will swallow the sun again.
So I carry the pistol around with me everyday.
If there was Google, it'd be great.
Goo…
What?
It's a guru of everything.
It will answer all your questions.
I know someone who has answers to everything.
Another two…
Two days?
Two months.
Another two months, Rahu will swallow the sun.
What?
Oh, but Rahu will swallow the sun just for a short moment.
If you miss this chance,
I can't tell you when there will be another one.
I have an idea.
Before Mathus returns home,
sir,
may I have permission to let Mathus read it?
Mathus can read the words in this journal fluently.
"Now we're in Rama III era."
"It's the golden age of foreign trade."
"Especially trade with the Chinese."
"Lots of money was earned by the Royal Treasury."
"This is called the Red Purse Money."
This is very interesting.
Let me take a look.
Oh, okay.
Oh, a girl with glasses.
So beautiful.
Lady Karaket also has records of Mr. Hunter.
Father Pallegoix is also in it.
"Pallegoix
who wrote the four-language dictionary…"
I don’t want to know about myself.
Oh, wait.
And I also think that you all
should not know about things that haven't happened yet.
But Lady Karaket wanted us to know, sir.
She wrote the records for us.
Miss Gaysorn.
Return the key to me.
If you don't listen to me, don't come to study with me anymore.
I prohibit you all from studying this journal.
Miss Gaysorn, keep it in the cabinet.
Even if it's a bad event, if it's God's will,
we have to let it happen.
THE PRINCE'S PALACE
No matter what,
I think we should buy the ship from Mr. Hunter.
Who knows when the colonial troops of the Westerners will arrive at Siam?
A number of their spies are secretly disguised among us already.
Our naval fleet should have the ship and the newest weaponry
to defend ourselves.
I must ask a favor from you, Phra Surasawad,
the Royal Advisor to the Prince whom he highly trusts,
to please advise the Prince
to see the advantages of purchasing this ship.
I won't buy it.
When the Advisor and Minister of Treasury proposed me to buy this ship,
I've doubted how an iron steamboat
can really float on water and move on its own.
And your ship arriving so late… Who knows?
You might have modified junk and towed it from England to Siam.
And now, you have the nerve to raise the price.
I won't buy it…
Now the ship has arrived.
If you don't believe the steamboat really can move on its own,
all you have to do
is go out and take a look for yourself!
I don't believe you.
And I'm not going out there to look.
And I…
won't buy your ship.
Let go of him, Khun.
You are fraudsters.
The Siamese are cheats.
They don't keep their promises.
I'm going to tell the British navy to bring warships
to close off the Gulf of Siam.
Whoa!
Hold on, Mr. Hunter.
Get dressed properly first.
I have a solution to dispel any doubts about
whether a ship made of steel will float and move on its own or not.
I would like to ask for your permission to board the ship
to study the design and structure of the ship in detail
so that I can make a functioning miniature
and use it to prove to the Prince where he can see it for himself.
Chief Sombatbordi is the best craftsman of the Royal Treasury.
He has the expertise in mechanical engines and chemistry.
Advisor, what are your thoughts?
I agree to this.
I hope you will be successful
in building a miniature steamboat according to plan.
Yes, sir.
Imagine a crocodile coming from the right,
turn the steering wheel to the left.
But if it's coming from the left,
turn the steering wheel to the right.
I don't see why there has to be a crocodile.
If I want to go left, I steer left.
If I want to go right, I steer right. It's easier to understand.
Let me try.
It's heavy.
It's hard for you.
Mathus, I want to look at the steam engine.
Can you take me to see it?
What's wrong with him?
What is this table?
Is it to calculate the ship's route?
It's a game called tic-tac-toe.
The captain must have been bored, so he played it to pass the time.
And the two T's,
what does it mean?
I REALLY MISS MOM AND GRANDMA.
Oh, it's a symbol.
It's like a crying face.
Hey.
Ouch!
It's just a cramp.
Bear with it.
Hey.
Can I ask you a question?
What are your intentions with Gaysorn?
Don't lie.
Well…
I like her.
She's someone I want to go out with.
Someone you want to go out with?
What does that mean?
In my era, it's normal for men and women to hang out.
You don't have to overthink things.
Miss Gaysorn is a sweet person.
Anyone who meets her would have to like her.
But I'm going to return home.
I won't court her.
Honestly, your method doesn't work.
Hey, how about this?
Wear these sunglasses first.
I guarantee it'll make girls go crazy for you.
ASSUMPTION CHURCH
WORKSHOP
You go over there.
When you are working on the miniature ship is the best time.
The first step is to bombard her with "likes" to show your love.
What?
Do we need to use a bomb?
What can we use in this era to express your love for her?
You used flowers just like the 'heart' button in IG?
Wow.
Awesome!
It's more like awful.
An awful failure.
Come on.
Don't get discouraged.
Let's keep on going.
The second method is called take care and take her heart.
Have some water, sir.
-Water… -Art thou tired?
Let me pass it for thee.
Art thou tired?
Let me do it for thee.
Art thou tired? I'll turn it for thee.
Is this the page?
Or is it this one?
-Art thou tired? -Will you please stop asking?
The next step is the most important.
This is the death step.
Because it's the way you fade out to make her anxious.
I'm really tired of your funny wording.
You'll have to disappear to make her worried.
And how can I disappear
when I have to build the ship here?
Let's just say do whatever you can.
Just don't let Gaysorn see your face.
Keep on rowing.
Yes, sir.
Doesn’t he come here to build the miniature?
Right, miss.
Why is he passing by this way then?
When she hasn't seen your face for a few days,
she will come to you and ask…
What's wrong, Chief?
I'm not free to talk right now.
I'm not free in the evening either.
I'm meeting with a friend at the market.
I'm not free to escort thee home either.
Oh, the friend is a girl.
I didn't know someone like you had friends.
And a girl friend too.
Who is she?
I have someone I go-went-gone out with.
Just, "go out with."
But I haven't decided on anything yet.
It's not anything serious.
I've stopped believing in destiny already.
No wonder why you've been acting strange lately.
So you've finally stopped believing in destiny.
I'm happy for you, Chief.
Congrats.
Mathus.
Want some mangoes?
Your hand is dirty.
It's all right. I'll feed you.
Thanks, Gaysorn.
Mathus!
I will heat the boiler.
The steam will flow through the pipes to the piston valves,
pressing them to move up and down,
rotating the axle that is attached to the paddle.
And this is how the pressure used to move the ship happens.
Why is the paddle moving so fast?
It's nothing.
My machine is just that powerful.
Watch out!
Are the two of you all right?
You don't have to get the doctor.
I can ask one of the helps to dress my wound.
Hi.
The doctor is here.
It's gone in quite deep.
It will need to be stitched up.
Emelie.
Chief.
You don’t have to be afraid.
In my time, Dr. Bradley is very famous.
He's acclaimed as the father of Thai printing.
And what does it have to do with my treatment?
Doctor.
Your newspaper is called Bangkok Recorder, right?
I've been looking for a name for the newspaper.
Good but, please stitch up the wound first.
If you fell the other way,
your butt wouldn't have been stabbed like this.
It's good
that I…
covered you two.
If not the pole…
The pole might have stabbed you.
Instead of going home…
You might have been a ghost haunting
the church here.
Doctor.
Can you take it easy?
Just one more.
Oh, he's detailed.
You are unharmed.
And Gaysorn is safe.
It's my blessing.
You really are a rare item.
Rare…
Rare what?
Ouch!
Oh, he's pulling no punches.
Is it painful?
Bhop.
"Bhop."
Ouch!
Ouch.
Bhop.
What's wrong with your hands?
Does it hurt?
May I take a look?
Red ginger lily.
People in the old days said it means unchanging love.
If it's the old saying, then it might not be true now.
But at this moment,
thy cheeks are as red as the lily.
And your face is now so big that the lily can't hide it.
They're flirting.
Art thou using
the "take care and take my heart" method with me?
Oh, he just planted an entire tree.
This time it's orchids.
What does it mean?
It means
a man's blooming love towards a woman who is dear to him,
but won't accept him yet.
Did people in the old days clearly state that?
It is my own saying.
No one from the old days said it.
Chief is infatuated with you already.
If he has a taste of your dessert, he'll be head over heels in love
as if he drinks a love potion.
I only know how to make this.
Take it.
Yes, miss.
Oh, really?
Is it too fast?
I think it's too late even.
I've wanted to marry Gaysorn since we first met.
Don't be too obvious, miss.
Can I ask you something?
What makes you sure Gaysorn is the right one?
I have
dreamed of her for over ten years.
I've only dreamed of her.
How could it not be?
So you like her
just because she reminds you of your ex?
It's not just that they look alike.
It's as if they're the same person!
If this is your answer,
I, as a bridesmaid, won't allow this to pass.
I'd tell you to go daydreaming.
What book do you want me to translate?
I'm in a rush to go home. It's already late.
There are some Westerners' alphabet letters.
I can't read it.
I'd like for thou to translate it for me.
Kneel on one knee.
This magnolia garland…
I grew the plant and made the garland myself.
I remember in our past life, thou liked to tuck one behind thy hair.
Will thou marry me?
What is the reason that you want to marry me?
If your answer is because we're a destined couple,
you don't need to answer me.
That's not the only reason.
I just think that…
I…
I've been getting hurt lately.
It might be because we haven't been married as promised.
I'm very worried that one day the person who gets hurt is thee.
So if we weren't betrothed because our lives depend on it,
if you had never dreamed of me,
if we were someone who had just met,
would you still want to marry me?
Will thou stop coming up with things that aren't real?
Will you stop calling me thou?
I feel like you're talking to someone else, not me.
What are you worried about, Chief?
The Prince will surely be satisfied
with the miniature ship you made.
I thought you wouldn't be able to complete it.
But the miniature ship is able to work perfectly.
Chief, you truly do have the skills it takes.
I'm very impressed.
This being the situation,
shall I continue on with purchasing the ship, sir?
If our Siamese engineers are so skilled, they can make their own ship themselves.
I don't think there is any reason to waste money on buying a ship
from the British at all.
Are you saying
that we won't buy the ship from Mr. Hunter, sir?
What if he reports this to the British Army?
Don't you use this to threaten me.
I'm not afraid of those Westerners.
THE BRITISH FACTORY ROYAL TREASURY PIER
THE PRINCE'S PALACE THE PRINCE'S THEATER
You're here, Pi?
Come in. I'm almost done reading my book.
Is Father Pallegoix here or not?
He's not in.
What business do you have?
There's something suspicious about the steamboat.
I want to know if Lady Karaket recorded this in her journal.
Bhop, I think we should ask for Pallegoix's permission first.
He wouldn't allow it anyway.
I just want to take a quick look.
This is strange.
Pallegoix shouldn't have taken the chest elsewhere.
Thou.
Bhop!
You can't be trusted.
Wait.
Hold on. Please listen to me first.
I just want to know something from the Lady's journal.
Once Mr. Hunter found out that Siam wouldn't buy the ship,
he was furious.
Just you wait!
If they don't buy my ship,
I'll sell it to their enemy.
Siam will lose to Cochinchina because of this ship!
So, I'd like to know…
what will happen with the steamboat.
Well then, please let me take a look.
I think we should let it take its own course,
just like Pallegoix said.
But…
How about this?
Let's take a vote.
Volt?
Vote.
How?
Do what I say.
Who thinks we should read the journal?
Raise your hand.
Next, who thinks we shouldn't read it?
Raise your hand.
All right. Open it.
Hey!
But I don't agree.
The principle of voting is you have to respect the majority's decision.
And here, Chief and I, we have two votes.
You have only one.
Oh, this is how it works.
But if I still don't want you to read it, what do I need to do?
You just accept it.
I found Hunter.
"Hunter brought the Express steamboat to sell to Siam,
but Siam turned down the purchase."
"He then threatened to sell the ship to Cochinchina,
which is Vietnam in the future."
"After that, Hunter was exiled from the country."
Just a threat resulted in exile?
What else did the Lady say?
She…
What did you say?
The thunder was so loud I couldn't hear you.
I said that was all the Lady wrote about Hunter.
And did she write about the Prince?
The Prince?
Yesterday
I saw some smuggling going on with crates being brought from Hunter's steamboat
and stored in the Prince's theater.
Even though these two hate each other.
Do you know anything about this?
I have no idea.
I have a way to get into the theater.
Mathus.
Could you look through Mr. Hunter's office?
There might be evidence that you could bring to me.
Do not worry.
Tomorrow when the sun is swallowed,
we'll send off Mathus together.
When will the person from the theater bring the keys?
No one is coming.
We'll break in.
I'll take a look to see if anyone is guarding that area.
Whoa.
It's pitch dark.
That's your windpipe.
Bhop.
Phu, what are you doing, sir?
I brought a performer for the master to consider.
He's famous in Klang city.
The master asked him to try on the outfit.
But the room is locked.
I'm going to go get the key to unlock it.
Hold on.
Today is my shift to guard the store room.
Are you really a famous performer?
Show me.
Your moves are awkward.
How can the people of Klang like you?
What is that?
I don't think you're a performer.
Who is he, sir?
Phu, why did you hit me?
So this is it.
The magical windpipe that makes people fall asleep.
Khun Yutthamat.
That's my butler.
He gave me a ride here.
He's trustworthy.
I already told you.
Do not bring anyone with you.
What's in the chest?
Let's open it.
It's just curtains for the backdrop.
I knew it. It's just all in your head.
With all these muskets,
the Prince and Hunter are definitely planning a coup.
You.
What did you hear?
I didn't really hear anything.
Sir.
Why did you follow me then?
Who are you really? Tell me.
LUANG AWUTWISET
This pistol has been kept over a century as a family heirloom.
I'm your descendant.
I came from the future.
I mean, I came from the time ahead.
What are you talking about?
Sir.
Don't follow the Prince's plan.
Otherwise, you'll be exiled from Siam.
The Prince and I planned for Siam to turn down the deal in the first place.
I agreed to make the deal because the Prince will make me
the Minister of the Royal Treasury, overseeing all the trades in Siam.
Sir!
Sir!
Don’t do this, sir!
Tomorrow, when I'm done with my business,
I will send you off to be a slave in Singapore.
Sir!
I'm begging you.
I have to return home tomorrow!
Sir!
Go to bed first, miss.
The Chief will come soon.
I can't fall asleep.
Is this an ominous sign?
What sign, miss?
I couldn't hear you.
What's with the chair?
Are you tidying up the room?
Chief.
Let go.
I didn't see you coming.
Just what I thought. Something bad happened.
Mr. Hunter locked me up
because I knew his secret.
What evidence did you find?
In the Lady Karaket's journal,
it said the reason Mr. Hunter was exiled
was because he put cannons aboard the steamboat
and fired them at the city wall.
And now Mr. Hunter…
He's heading to the steamboat.
Didn't Chief come with you?
Mr. Hunter is preparing a coup.
They're planning to hand Siam to the British
according to the order from the Prince.
You don't know this because I tore the page out from the journal.
What is the reason for hiding this from me?
I was afraid that if you knew,
you would arrest Mr. Hunter
even though he hasn't done anything yet.
You really are selfish.
You're just worried for your ancestor.
Have you forgotten about the people of this country?
No wonder why the Prince
took the Minister of the Royal Treasury and my father
away for urgent work at Pak Nam.
I'll go home to send an express horse
to tell Father to return quickly.
Gaysorn.
This is for you.
Miss.
TO MATHUS, WE WISH FOR YOUR HAPPINESS
IN 177 YEARS INTO THE FUTURE.
WE WILL MISS YOU.
Pi, give this letter to the express horse and send it to Father.
Where are you going, miss?
Are you going after the Chief?
Don't worry about me.
Pi, go right now.
Miss, please don't go.
It's dangerous.
Miss, please don't go.
-Pi! -Miss!
Quickly go now.
Your lifeline might be reaching its end.
No matter what, I can't let you go.
No!
-Let go of me! -Please don't go, miss!
Pi!
Pi!
Pi, I'm begging you.
Send this letter to Father right now.
Miss.
Stop, Mr. Hunter.
The Police Colonel is bringing the soldiers and police here.
Stop what you're doing.
Miss.
What is the Police Colonel going to arrest me for?
It just happens that today is Captain Brown's birthday.
He's the captain of this steamboat.
According to our traditions,
we have to take the ship out to fire a celebratory salute.
I know you're planning to do some bad things.
-How did you get here? -Who is there?
Help!
Help me.
Help me.
Help!
Help me.
Sir, what are you doing?
Aren't we just going to fire up into the sky?
Aiming in that direction is firing at the city wall.
That's right.
Won't we all lose our heads?
Not all of us.
Just you.
And your cronies.
You can sweet talk the Prince into buying…
I believe that if we purchase this steamboat,
Siam will be a feared armed force in the region.
…or not buying this steamboat.
The decision is yours to make.
The ship is not in an ideal state.
Siam has the capability to build our own ship.
I don't think that we need to buy the ship from those Westerners.
"Pao Hoo."
Pao Hoo! Pao Hoo.
Bhop.
Are you all right?
A moment ago, was I
cool?
Freakin' cool, Mr. Sailor!
But right now, please free me.
Thou and Mathus quickly find a hiding place.
I’ll try to stall them
while we're waiting for the troops to come.
In the time ahead,
will Siam be a colony under the British?
Never.
If so…
I will make your history
the same.
You really are a good ancestor.
Bhop.
What about Mr. Hunter?
Bhop, watch out!
Hey!
Mathus.
Run!
Wait.
Go after them!
You go in first. I'll stall them.
Don't worry.
Oops.
Damn, is that The Hulk?
SLOW
Crocodile is on the left, steer the ship to the right.
The city wall is on the right, turn the wheel to the left!
It's nothing.
I can take it.
The masseuse I know has heavier elbows than you!
Wait. Chill, man.
Barn owl!
Help me.
Shoot, damn it!
Aim towards the city wall. Don't miss it again.
Hold on. Take it easy.
Whoa!
What the hell is wrong with you guys?
My ears are about to burst!
Are you a British spy?
It takes
a lot of effort and time
to load the bullets.
Don't you get that?
What kind of ominous day is this?
Don't shoot!
It might take you forward in time.
I forgot the bullet.
Wherever this pistol will take thee,
I'm going with thee too.
Bhop!
Gaysorn!
Your lady is awake.
Bring some water for her to get freshen up right now.
Yes, sir. Khun Sriwisarnwaja.
How art thou, my dear Karaket?
Thou were dead asleep.
THIS JOURNAL IS MADE AS A RECORD OF EVENTS IN AYUTTHAYA ERA.
MY NAME IS KETSURANG. I'M A FOURTH-YEAR ARCHEOLOGY STUDENT.
Thou have filled up all the pages in thy journal, correct?
It's all right.
I'll have someone make new ones for thee, just like this one.
Found them!
Found them!
Gaysorn.
Do you hear me?
Gaysorn!
She's not breathing.
We have to give her CPR.
Put your right hand over your left.
Press into the middle of her chest real hard.
Harder!
Gaysorn.
Gaysorn.
Next.
Pinch her nose and blow air into her mouth twice.
Blow…
Blow air into her mouth by using my mouth?
I can't.
There's no time.
I'll do it then.
…if you had never dreamed of me,
if we were someone who had just met,
would you still want to marry me?
Gaysorn.
Gaysorn.
Gaysorn.
Gaysorn.
Gaysorn.
Bhop.
What a waste…
of the respect
and trust I had in you.
Why did you use my name
to start a coup?
All that I did was for you, sir.
Let's go.
In the name of Siam, we need to arrest you.
Please do not resist.
That pistol probably took you here for this reason.
But
I'm sorry that I lost your pistol.
God or other sacred beings
must have wanted the pistol here.
But the pistol couldn't come on its own.
So I had to come with it too.
You really are a good descendant.
The news from abroad states that when Mr. Hunter was exiled,
he sold the steamboat to Cochinchina
for 67,000 dollars.
I know
that you all secretly read the journal.
But
I also know the journal used to belong to you.
You keep it.
I probably won't read Lady Karaket's journal anymore.
I'm determined to record
the events of the world I am living in now.
In my own way.
I will record the events of Siam in my own way as well.
This is how history is.
The same event,
different people recording, different perspectives.
LUANG AWUTWISET
Mathus.
Mathus.
Mathus!
Pei.
Did Chief Sombatbordi come to our house?
Yes, but I chased him away.
He came to confess to me that he has taken liberties with you.
He would like to take responsibility and marry you.
What?
Oh, no.
Hi there!
Hey!
Miss.
May I hitch a ride on your boat?
Can you please row faster? I'm in a rush.
Miss.
Please let me.
Bhop!
Bhop.
Bhop!
Bhop!
Bhop!
Bhop!
Bhop!
Bhop!
Don't you
have any flowers for me today?
A kafferboom.
I collected from thy house.
Did you know?
People in the old days said
whoever smells the kafferboom will remember their past life.
I know.
Which is why I've never given thee one.
That day I drowned, I dreamed and saw
that our past lives together was real.
I was Lady Karaket.
You were Khun Sriwisarnwaja.
All right.
Us two will leave now.
Do you believe what I said?
Whether I believe it or not, it's not important anymore.
Because ever since I've met thee,
I've never dreamed of Lady Karaket again.
Because the person I think of is thee.
The person who I love in this life.
The photograph will be evidence we can leave for our children
that the times we were together are real.
But the locals are saying
this box pulls souls into it.
How about I draw ten pictures of thee to make up for it?
You don't have to be afraid.
If this box pulls souls into it…
I will go with you.
Stand still.
One, two, three.
My dej-ti-ny.
Right here, uncle.
I remember.
In my last life, I buried it with my own hands.
An angel told me in my dream.
I wasn't worthy of protecting it.
It should be kept underneath Ayutthaya soil.
For the future.
2022
I'm good.
Follow me.
-Welcome. -Thanks.
Are you okay?
-I'm fine. You? -I'm fine.
What is this? What happened to you?
It's nothing. I fell.
What do you mean, you fell?
I just fell.
He says hi.
STREET FLOW 2
2 YEARS LATER
Come on!
Hurry up. I've been asking you to do this for five minutes.
Hey, in the back!
Come in.
He's always late!
-8:40 a.m.? -Public transit, miss.
Do you have your own public transit? You're the only one who is late.
-Do you know what "public" means? -What "public" means?
Transit for a guy in misery?
-He's right. -No.
It means for everyone. Shared among many.
Get your things out.
"The street about me roared with a deafening sound."
So put in your AirPods.
-"And there, in the middle of the crowd…" -A chick.
A chick. Tall, slender, and sadly beautiful.
Sadly hot.
Yeah!
Hey, okay! Enough.
He was so thirsty.
Baudelaire is a Symbolist poet.
Miss, we don't care about Baudelaire.
Can't you tell us about stuff from our century?
-Like who? -I don't know, Niro?
-Ninho, miss! -Or Kalash Criminel!
We can think about it, but today, we're reading To a Passerby by Baudelaire.
The poem speaks of love.
That's a universal subject. Has it never happened to you?
You're waiting for the RER. You see someone, and you think,
"Maybe we could have had an amazing love story."
Not to me. If I see a chick I like, I go get her Snap.
You get it.
You're a player, man.
Shut up. Whose Snap are you gonna get with that face?
He's jealous because he's ugly.
He's not going to get one Snap. It's sad.
Fuck you. You think I'm your buddy?
-Watch your language, Anis. -My language?
He's been disrupting the class. Now it's my fault?
Miss, let it go. That's how Aviateurs guys are.
They talk a lot, but when it goes down, they run.
Run? Run from what?
-I said, you run! -Boys, stop!
You run away!
Fuck you! You're putting on a show!
-Let's go outside! -Let's go outside!
-Noumouké! -Let him. He's putting on a show.
You show up late, then you start acting out?
Keep your head down. Calm down, okay? Both of you go to the principal's office.
-Mr. Delors? -Yes?
Mr. Mercier is ready to see you. Would you please follow me?
Yes.
-Mr. Mercier? -Yes.
Mr. Delors is here.
Hello.
Mr. Mercier, this is Mr. Traoré. He's my sales manager.
Hello, Mr. Traoré. Hello.
Look, Mr. Delors. Your company has experience in the building trades.
We've looked at your balance sheet, which was quite impressive for 2019.
It's two years since we opened the insulation division.
An initiative of our sales manager, Mr. Traoré.
He's the boss. His wish is my command.
He's the boss. His wish is my command. He's not full of himself either?
No.
Let's get straight to the point.
How many gigs do you produce a month? What? 150? 200?
200 gigs.
-We'll need one tera by next month. -That's 1,000 gigs.
We can do it.
The ones before you said they could do it.
But they didn't convince you. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here.
But they didn't convince you. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here. Do you know what that means? You'll need five times more customers.
Do you know what that means? You'll need five times more customers.
Five times more sales representatives, labor, trucks, materials,
and most of all, five times more investment.
And you would need five companies the size of Mr. Delors'.
That means five times more intermediaries, risk,
and perhaps, in the end, five times more problems.
I'm sure you have enough problems.
What is this?
-We noticed that you're a soccer fan. -Well, yes.
This comes with no obligation.
No? Presidential suite?
You should have started with that.
-It's in the bag. -Don't get carried away. It's not done.
If it does work out, I still need to find trucks, salesmen,
and even a call center.
Anyway, if it works out,
you're going to double your revenue.
And?
I'd like a little raise.
Remember when you came from Belgium without a penny to your name?
What did you say?
Find me something. Give me work.
Do you remember?
Now you get 3,000 euros a month just to put your name on some papers,
and you want a raise?
Get out of the car.
-Demba, come on. -Get out of the car!
-It's far. -I said, get out of the car!
Hurry up, for fuck's sake!
Okay.
You'll end up with nothing!
-You're gonna leave me here? -Shut up.
Careful, Rime!
Come on, let's go!
Yes, come in.
Yes, I'll be late.
I can't be in two places at once.
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.
Soulaymaan, what can I do for you?
I'm tired of preparing drafts.
It's part of the job.
I know, but I didn't become an attorney to do that.
I want to plead, to work with clients. A real attorney.
You're an associate in this firm.
Nothing is stopping you from pleading for your own clients in court.
Come on.
You're drowning us in work.
Even if I took my own clients,
I'd never find the time to attend to them.
You are compensated in return.
You're welcome to put an end to this collaboration.
Young lawyers are lining up at the door.
Soulaymaan.
Go visit our clients in the Fleury Prison.
You want to work with clients, right?
That's not what I had in mind.
Well, it's that or drafts.
Of course, be reassuring. Tell them that the case is moving forward. That you're going to talk to the judge.
Tell them that the case is moving forward. That you're going to talk to the judge.
Yes? I was going to call you back.
-Are you good? All right? -Yeah, you? Chilling.
So?
Demba, hook me up with your guy at the Port of Le Havre.
I'm going to get my own stuff.
I'm not involved anymore. I don't want to be seen with them.
If you stop taking Abdel's stuff, you'll be in trouble.
-I don't want my name to come up. -Who is Abdel? I do what I want.
There's no godfather or whatever. This isn't Italy.
You know how much he makes with Sahli's turf? He supplies all of Val-de-Marne, and I can't get my own stuff?
He supplies all of Val-de-Marne, and I can't get my own stuff? Come on, brother.
I'm gonna tell you something.
It was Abdel who told me this.
"On the streets, there are two kinds of people who don't last."
"An old-timer underestimating a young guy's greed."
"A young guy underestimating an old-timer's experience."
You understand?
Okay, Demba. See you later.
What did he say?
He's underestimating my greed.
Fuck him and Abdel.
-No. Don't say that, bruh. -What? Are you with them or with me?
It's not about that.
When I had trouble with guys from Auber, Demba stuck his neck out for me.
You can't forget that.
I got it. He's your big brother. Fine.
Your plate.
-I'm good, Mom. -No, eat a bit more.
A little bit, then.
That's a little bit?
Eat.
That's not a little bit.
INCOMING CALL SOFIA
Remember Hawa?
Binta's daughter.
She's getting married soon.
Binta's daughter is getting married?
How old is she? She's 22.
I was married at 18. Right.
Ma, do you have someone for Soulaymaan? A chick without teeth.
Stop it.
If Soulaymaan was ready, I'd get him a woman tomorrow.
A lot of moms have asked me.
-A lot of moms? -A lot.
Okay.
He's not into that. He's going to bring a very white, blue-eyed blonde.
That's what he's into.
There's the daughter of the cousin--
The cousin of your aunt,
the one who lives close to the neighbor…
Her daughter-in-law who…
It's fine. Thank you.
Are you making fun of your poor mother?
No, Mom. I have a career to build.
It's not everything to have a family. You have to be able to afford it.
Soulaymaan, your father wasn't a lawyer.
You've always had a roof over your head, food and drink, and clothes.
Right?
INCOMING CALL SOFIA Turn that off, Noumouké.
How is school?
-Is that it? -I'm getting good grades.
-It's fine. -I hope so, for your sake.
It's time for prayer.
-Enjoy your meal. -Thank you.
Where are you going?
Six months wasn't enough?
You want to go back to prison?
You're not leaving here.
Fuck him up!
What's up? What are you talking about?
I didn't tell Demba about you being expelled.
But that's it. I'm not covering for you anymore.
-Do you have a short memory? -I never asked you for anything.
-I never asked you to take the blame. -I know. You didn't have to ask.
Close the door.
Big brother.
Abdou!
Aïssa! Come.
Why did you do that?
Fuck!
Stop! Hey, stop!
Stop! Give me your hands!
You're hurting me! Let go of me!
I can hold it.
-Give it. I'll-- -Stop it!
Sofia, Demba was there. He stopped me. I couldn't leave.
You think I was scared?
You think I was scared or what?
You'll see what I'm going to do to them.
Hang on. It's that son of a bitch, Anis.
You bitches!
We have to wait. They'll be expecting us.
You'll see.
Trust me.
Let me hold it for you.
The projects
They had the nerve to raid the projects
I'll show them that I can be bad too
And I won't need my big brother for that
Give me a piece And I'll even leave them on the ground
On the ground
When?
Tomorrow morning.
-How much? -Ten kilos of hash and two kilos of coke.
Where is the pickup?
The usual.
You're sure he'll be there?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Farid.
If you're jerking me around…
Look at me.
I won't let it go.
-You got me? -I got you.
Show your hands!
Mr. Abdel.
What's going on? You're surprised?
All this for me?
That's right. All this for you.
An apple a day
keeps the doctor away.
You're cocky, eh?
On my mother's life, I'll get you. Don't worry. You piece of shit.
We're missing some completion notices.
I did it. It's in order.
Rime has been asking for them for a week.
You see her?
She acts on my behalf.
-Okay, boss. -Okay.
Your cousin is here.
Let him in. Never make Doums wait.
Bring me the notices, guys.
I'm getting the truck. I'll bring them.
"I'm getting the truck. I'll bring them."
-He heard you, you crazy fool. -What is he gonna do?
You work with undocumented workers.
-They're absolute machines. -I'm gonna rat you out to the URSSAF.
Hire some guys from the projects.
All they do is complain and ask for raises.
That's called integration.
That's assimilation, not integration.
You can't tell guys from the projects a thing.
You're making a killing.
Appearances can be deceiving.
I've had one struggle after another.
That said, sitting in an office all day, checking on employees,
that's not for me.
You spend hours overseeing a trap house.
I saw that coming.
I miss Samir, that bastard.
Demba!
Watch out!
Are you really done?
Do you know what insanity is?
Insanity is always doing the same thing and expecting different results.
Stop philosophizing.
Come on. Come here.
Hello.
-Hello. -How are you?
Are you kidding me?
I've been struggling for an hour.
You're looking for trouble. Turn that off.
Get up.
Get up.
I had to fight the principal to prevent you from being expelled.
Even for you to be allowed on school grounds.
Come sit down.
You're gonna read this.
Noumouké, you're gonna read this book
and write me an essay about how it made you feel.
I don't want an analysis. I want to know what you felt.
Miss, the truth is, that doesn't interest me much.
Oh yeah? And how do you know that?
I know myself well.
The hardest part is starting.
I promise you that you'll lose track of time.
What's this thing about?
It's the story of Martin Eden.
No, really? Doesn't it say Martin Eden?
It's about a guy who doesn't like to read and spends his time fighting.
Remind you of someone?
And you?
One day, Martin Eden defends someone in a fight. A very rich man.
The rich man has a sister.
Martin Eden falls in love with her.
But the sister is upper class. She's educated, rich.
So Martin Eden tells himself he'll educate himself.
He'll read every book. And once he's like her,
she'll fall in love with him.
You think I'm Martin Eden?
You think I'm going to read to seduce a chick?
You've never fought to impress a girl?
So, does he get with her?
-What? -Stop playing.
In the end, does he get with the chick?
-Where are you headed? -Nanterre.
That's far.
-Good evening. -Good evening.
-Good evening, Djenaba. -Good evening.
And you? Choisy?
-No, Vitry. -She has to pick up her son.
You have a son.
Yes. Idrissa. He's ten years old.
You're going from here to Vitry, Vitry to Choisy, on public transit?
That's how it is raising a child on your own.
I can take you partway.
You surprised me with that meeting with Arcus.
I've been trying to get one for ages.
Where were you working before this?
I haven't worked for two years.
Wow. Why is that?
I started wearing the veil two years ago.
And you, sir? What did you do before insulation?
Me?
Always the construction industry.
You don't have to call me "sir." I'm not 50 years old.
I can't do it.
Why not?
I don't know.
It's not like you're that young.
I'm joking.
Stop acting crazy.
-You played me real good! -Calm down! What's going on?
Why would I do that? I want Abdel to fall too.
-How would he have known? -No clue. Your colleagues?
Stop your bullshit. You think everybody is into double-crossing like you?
I warned you, Farid.
I'm not letting you out of my sight. I'm going to be a leech.
I'm going to eat Farid, sleep Farid,
and when I fuck, I'll fuck Farid.
It won't stop until you go down. Trust me.
Shut up! Don't touch me!
Stop getting angry for nothing.
This is my turf, I swear!
If I were you, I'd keep a low profile.
You know why? Because Abdel probably knows it came from you.
What did you tell him? Huh?
You fucking bitch! What did you tell him? Huh?
The chambermaids at the Hotel Ibis in Batignolles are on strike.
They're protesting their work conditions and low wages.
Among their demands, they mention the unequal treatment
of subcontractors and salaried employees.
Turn it down.
They've been showing the same thing.
"They've been showing the same thing…"
You've been watching the same shit too.
I'm going to bed. There's nothing to do here.
He's offended.
Okay, Mr. Lawyer.
You're really going to sleep?
Yeah, I am. I'm dead. Miss Saadi made me read all day.
What book?
Martin Eden by Jack London.
"On the library shelves, I saw a world emerge on the horizon."
-You read it? -Yeah, I read it.
You know it by heart?
No, I don't know it by heart. I only know a few quotes.
It always sounds good to add one or two quotations to a defense speech.
All that to seem French.
What do you mean, "to seem French"?
I don't want to be uncultured.
"He who speaks the language of a people avoids its evil."
Hello. Hello.
Hello.
He's asking us to provide one tera by next month.
We don't have enough staff… DINNER?
I DON'T KNOW…
You should ask the big boss. Demba?
Demba?
We're going to grow the team.
We'll have to train the new people.
We'll use a second call center in Morocco.
THAT'S NOT A NO… We're not sending you out to battle without any weapons.
-How are you, Ma? -I'm good, Soulaymaan.
Can I try?
Mama. Come on. Just a little bit.
It's for my charity.
You know I love your bissap.
If you like the bissap, pay for it.
How is it going?
I'm at the preface. It's moving along.
Do you like it?
If you're trying to tell me I need to become a nerd to make it,
I think I get it.
Right, can I go?
Bye, miss.
-You're not taking the book? -No.
I'm not bringing it home unless I have to.
Traoré.
-That's how you greet me? -I don't have friends in the police.
I know. Mr. Demba Traoré isn't a snitch. I hear you're in the insulation business?
-You're going to arrest me for that? -No. What I'm interested in is narcotics.
I'm not involved.
What are you trying to do here? Tell me.
You're trying to start a new life? It's the new Demba, is that it?
Do you remember June 28, 2018?
On the day they tried to kill you,
guess whose phone pinged in the same area Sahli was in?
You don't like guessing games?
You're trying to tell me Abdou was involved? I knew that.
No.
Abdou and Sahli were tight.
But between you and me, you think they did that on their own?
Those two? Demba, who ended Sahli?
Who took over Sahli's trap house when he got killed?
Who's dealing to Farid now that you're out of the game?
Here.
I don't want it.
They're photos from a surveillance camera.
They were together on the same day.
You want to use me to get rid of your enemies?
No. You're not a murderer, Demba.
You're in the insulation business, right?
It wasn't easy to get these photos. Take the time to look at them.
I can't believe it!
-He got Assia's Snap! -Stop it.
You got Assia's Snap! That's nasty!
Nasty.
Aren't they the guys from Aviateurs?
Hey! The guys from Aviateurs are at the bus stop.
-Who? -The guys from Aviateurs.
Take this.
Let's go, guys. Let's go. Let's get off.
Are you shaking?
What's up?
Hey, come here!
Hey, he's going down! Down!
Stop running! I won't hurt you!
You'll see, you son of a bitch! What's up, you son of a bitch?
Let go of me.
What's up, you son of a bitch?
Remember me, you son of a bitch?
Look at me, you son of a bitch! Remember me?
Film it! That's how it is in Bois-l'Abbé.
We kick your asses!
You son of a bitch.
You bitches.
-Let's go. -You little shit.
This place is wonderful.
Didn't I tell you you'd enjoy it?
-You can be sure I'll come back. -No "sir"?
It's the first time.
Thank you.
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
Since you know religion well…
Hold on. It's not because I wear the veil that I know religion well.
Okay, don't be so humble. You know the basics.
Yes. The very basics.
You know, in religion,
from what I know,
all sins can be repented.
Yes.
Even when you kill someone?
Why are you asking me this?
Don't freak out. It's not for me. It's…
Someone asked me, and so, you know, I'm asking you because you'll know.
I don't want to tell him nonsense.
In religion, all sins can be repented as long as you're alive.
But the sin of murder is one of the biggest sins.
You should know that.
Yeah, I know that. I told you that it wasn't for me.
Can I take these?
Soulaymaan, you're going to plead in court.
A case was brought up for immediate arraignment.
Neither Perrier nor I can go.
My secretary has emailed you.
It's time.
Hello.
Mr. Traoré.
You're the attorney?
Who else could it be?
You're young.
Mr. Millet, I'm going to get you released.
How? I confessed to everything while I was in custody.
It'd take too much time to explain.
The judge will try his best to save the case.
He's going to ask you questions to get you to repeat your confession,
which he could then use against you.
All I'm asking is
that you stay quiet.
Hello, sir. Mr. Traoré. I'm representing Mr. Millet.
Sir, the floor is yours.
Sir, I'll be brief.
Police officers arrested Mr. Millet at 10:58 a.m. on October 20th
and placed him in custody for violence with intent.
While he was in custody,
the detectives interrogated Mr. Millet about a small amount of cannabis
which they pretended he was carrying.
"Pretended"?
However,
Mr. Millet wasn't placed in custody for drug possession.
He was there for violence with intent, damage and breach of property.
The prosecutor will be aware that, according to French law,
a person in custody cannot be interrogated about an offense
other than the one they have been accused of.
And that's not all. According to Article 706-30-1 of the criminal code,
when it comes to drug possession, the weighing must be open.
The person in custody must attend the weighing of the products,
which wasn't the case.
For all these reasons, I'm asking for the cancellation of the proceedings.
Very well.
Sir.
We have Mr. Millet's confession in which he admitted
to punching Mrs. Marty in the face several times.
He can't deny it, as her jaw was broken
because, and let me quote him,
"The bitch didn't want to open the door."
That's all. I'll let you appreciate his artful wording.
Are these your words, Mr. Millet?
Mr. Millet, please?
I'll remain silent.
What?
Speak louder, Mr. Millet. We can't hear you.
I'll remain silent.
A bit like him, I'm full of hate
I come from the bottom, like Martin Eden
A bit like him, I--
The Frenchman is back.
No. Don't tell me you walked through the projects like that, please.
With a big blue, white, and red flag.
Okay, I was joking, man. Fuck you.
The lawyer is so rude.
Mama, you're looking at Mr. Traoré, attorney-at-law.
You're handsome, my son.
Thank you. I pleaded in court for the first time today.
I got the client released.
Wow. Tell me about it, my son.
Come on, tell us.
A man accused of breaking his wife's jaw was taken for immediate arraignment,
and I managed to…
What, Ma?
They need an attorney too. But does it have to be you?
So?
Forget about insulation.
Open a restaurant.
You'll have learned that in the slammer.
There's something I don't get.
Who took Sahli out?
It can't be Abdou. He was his friend.
These things happen.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Do you know the story about the frog and the scorpion?
A scorpion goes to a frog and asks,
"Can you carry me on your back across the river?"
The frog looks at the scorpion and says,
"No. You're going to sting me."
The scorpion looks at the frog
and says, "But if I sting you, we're both going to drown."
"I can't swim."
The frog thinks about it
and eventually agrees.
They start crossing the river.
In the middle of the river,
the scorpion stings the frog.
The scorpion says,
"I'm sorry."
"I couldn't help it."
"It's my nature."
And they both drown.
Did you know it?
Yeah.
I like hearing you tell stories.
Yeah! Hey, Noumouké!
Catch that son of a bitch!
Stop running!
-You're dead! -I'm going to fuck you up!
Stop!
Come here, you bitch!
We're going to kill that guy. Get him!
-Look! -He's there!
Go fuck your mothers!
Fuck him up!
Where's that bastard?
-Come on, go around. We'll catch him. -Over there.
-Don't do anything stupid. -No.
What are you doing here?
Get lost. Stop sucking your teeth.
I said not to give them anything.
I know, Farid. I won't.
Three, two, one.
Look at that.
It's wonderful.
You know what they say?
No.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
You're such a smooth talker.
Have you ever gone up? No, but I'd really like to.
Yeah?
And you?
Not yet.
We can't keep seeing each other like this.
"Like this"?
Like this, without purpose.
I need to know where we're headed. I can't play. I don't have the time.
You think I'm playing?
No, I didn't say that.
But I'm warning you.
And nothing is going to happen.
Meaning?
Nothing is going to happen physically.
I'm saving myself.
Fine with me.
And so?
-What do you mean, "And so?" -What do you want?
-Hello? -Hello? -Yeah. -Noumouké?
-Noumouké? -I'm joking. It's Noumouké's voice mail.
It's his voice mail.
Go ahead. You can pick up. I don't mind.
No, it's my mother.
I'll take you home. Then I'll call her back.
Here's a story.
A friend of mine was at a restaurant,
and her mother wouldn't stop calling, you know?
Instead of picking up,
she sent her a message, saying, "I'll call you later."
But later never came.
That story traumatized me.
Now, when my mother calls me, I pick up right away.
Yeah, Mom, it's me.
Demba. Help me find Noumouké. Noumouké didn't come home.
Find him for me. I don't know where he is.
Hey!
-I'm going to fuck you up! -Shut up!
Let go of me!
Gun!
Come on, get up!
Sofia! Come on, let's go!
Lamine, come here.
I said, come here.
-Where is Noumouké? -I don't know.
-Don't play with me, Lamine. -I'm not.
-Where is Noumouké? -I don't know.
-Did he get arrested? -No, he didn't.
Who fired the gun?
No one fired the gun.
"No one fired the gun"?
It was Sofia, but she fired into the air.
-Then we all ran away. -Where did she get the piece?
Where did she get it?
At Farid's trap house.
They're waiting to get paid.
Yeah, but…
Hey.
You give weapons to my brother?
I didn't.
-To his friends. It's the same thing. -I didn't, Demba.
Then they did. Aren't you the boss?
-Are you for real? -What do you mean, "Am I for real"?
-You do this in front of everybody? -What are you going to do?
Don't lie to yourself.
You're here because I left.
Get that son of a bitch!
Get him! Bring him back to me!
Bruh, are you okay?
I'm going to end him.
Pick your side, and fast.
He's going to go back to prison.
Stop scaring her.
Nobody died.
Noumouké needs to leave the gangs and weapons behind.
You need to talk to him.
Mom, when I was his age, there already was trouble with Aviateurs.
I was involved in it too.
Exactly.
That's why he's going to listen to you.
Will you?
Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry. He'll be back.
-Bye. -Bye.
-It's Lamine. -What is he saying?
Demba got him. He's looking for you.
Fuck, he's going to kill me.
I can't go home tonight.
You're staying here?
My brother leaves for work at 8:00 a.m. My mom at 9:00 a.m.
I'll wait for them to go.
I need to go home, or my mother will destroy me.
Stay with me for a bit?
I would've liked to have brothers and sisters.
Am I not your brother?
Do you miss your father?
Yeah, I miss him.
And you?
I can't miss him. I don't know him.
When he heard my mother was pregnant, he left. He didn't want me.
One day, we can try and look for him.
He doesn't want me. I'm not going to run after him.
Dad isn't here anymore Nobody knows how much pain I am in
I feel like I am in a starless night
Are these your lyrics?
Yeah.
Go on, sing it.
Dad isn't here anymore Nobody knows much pain I'm in
I feel like I am in a starless night
It's all blurry I don't know where to go
I just feel like running away
Mom doesn't smile anymore Home feels empty
No sun on the horizon
And some voids can never be filled
We can tell ourselves it will pass But Dad isn't here anymore
My Dad isn't here anymore
Nobody knows how much pain I am in
Nobody knows how much pain I am in
Since Dad is gone
Even summer feels cold
ALARM 06:45
What are you doing, Ma?
I'm looking out for the police
so that I can open the door before they break it.
They aren't going to come.
Come.
Come rest. I'm tired, Noumouké.
Police!
-What's going on? -Don't move! Show your hands!
-Your hands! -Yes! What's going on?
Come here. On your knees!
What's going on?
Sofia!
Sofia, what have you done?
What's happening?
You look beautiful.
I'm heading out.
When are you leaving?
I won't go to work until Noumouké is back.
It's going to be fine, okay? He's going to come home.
I love you.
I love you too.
Madam, put your phone away.
-This isn't a show. -Sofia!
Where are you taking her? Sofia.
-Where are you taking her? -Let go of me!
You hear what I'm saying? Put the phone away. Stop filming.
-What did she do? -Let go of me!
Mom!
Come on, move along.
Mom!
Help!
…not far away
No time for tomorrow
And if we were far away from here
But near Panama
Far away
No time for tomorrow
Ma?
Ma?
Ma?
Only God can create something that doesn't exist.
Human beings are not able to create.
For if human beings could create, then the blind man would make himself see.
The deaf man would make himself hear.
The quadriplegic would make himself mobile.
Not only that,
but most human beings would give themselves
but most human beings would give themselves and their loved ones eternal life.
So, my brother, love whoever you want.
Create attachments to whomever you want. You'll be separated from them.
Salam.
Death is like a doorway that each of us will cross.
My condolences.
Death is a journey.
What does anyone with the gift of reason do before a journey?
How are you feeling?
I used to think I was alone. Now I truly know what it is.
Listen…
I have a few things to do once I'm back.
After that,
I'd like to meet your son.
And I'd like us to do things by the book.
You know, Demba, there are two states in which one shouldn't make big decisions.
When you're really happy and when you're really sad.
I know what I'm saying.
You're going?
Yeah, I'm going.
-Let's talk later? -Okay.
Have you heard from Mercier?
Don't you want to talk about this later?
What's going on?
Listen, he's backing out. He's going with another team.
Don't look at me like that.
He's backing out?
We signed a contract.
Did you have a lawyer read that contract?
I invested time and money.
-I know. -A lot of money.
How much did they give him?
-Who? -The other team. How much to get rid of us?
Well, I don't know.
How much does he want?
He'll go with us if we give him 150,000 in cash.
What was your response?
I didn't close the door to it.
With all the dough you're going to make, what's 150,000?
My condolences, Demba.
Hey, Franck.
What made him think that you have 150,000 euros lying around like that?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Come see me at the office when I get back.
Until then, you tell him yes.
Got it.
Take care of yourself, Franck.
Yeah, for sure. You too.
Noumouké.
He says you look like your cousin, Ousmaan.
Ousmaan.
You can't deny you are a Traoré.
When family is corrupted and divided,
then the whole of society is unwell.
Come on, Noumouké. Get up. I'm coming.
I've come twice already.
Demba, I haven't showered. I'm sweaty.
Take that. Get changed.
What time is it?
-You've slept enough. -I'm tired.
Where's that well?
Thirty minutes on foot.
Thirty minutes?
Thirty minutes? More like an hour.
How do you know?
You ask too many questions.
He acted out so much that your mom sent him here.
Aren't you coming? No, I'll leave this to you.
It's deep, huh?
Okay.
Release it.
-Hi, Ousmaan. -Noumouké.
Hello.
Hens sit on their eggs…
It's the village school.
Your mother financed most of it with her charity.
She didn't have the time to finish it.
Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Fodié. -How are you?
These are the children of my sister-in-law, Khadijah.
My condolences.
How do you manage during rainy season?
It gets complicated.
We have to finish it.
It's a lot of work.
-Fodié. -Yes?
Do you think you can find the materials and workers?
With money, sure.
-Don't worry about money. -Okay.
Please share your network with me, Demba.
Put your phone away. Seriously, I really need it.
He says that he doesn't need his phone, but he wants it.
You live better here than we do.
He says that you're idealizing Africa.
It's been a long time since our societies became consumer societies too.
Why does he never speak in French?
I speak French better than you.
Hey, come!
Bags go over there.
Yes, Auntie.
-Driss? -Yeah?
Let's put it up.
-Watch your fingers, guys. -Yeah.
Thanks. Okay. We got it.
-Is that okay? -You got it?
Okay.
Come on, Demba. Yeah.
Yeah!
-Okay? -Thank you very much.
Time for a break, guys. Let's eat?
I'll finish up and join you.
You forgot this bit.
These big pants of yours.
Looks good, doesn't it?
I'm going back to France.
I'm going to stay with the kid a few more days.
I need to get inside his head.
Are you ready?
I'm warning you, we can't back out.
MINISTRY OF CULTURE HOUSE OF SLAVES
Hello.
Officially, 12 million slaves were deported to the Americas.
And some of them were detained in places similar to this.
It served as a waiting room.
Just like when you get to the hospital, there's a waiting room.
Small rowboats took them from here to the big ships,
which in turn went to America.
So, after the door, there was a bridge.
We call it the door of no return
because whoever crossed it never came back.
KHADIJAH TRAORÉ SCHOOL
LEARN, UNDERSTAND UNDERTAKE, SERVE
Do you know what Mom asked of me?
What?
For me to tell you to stop your nonsense.
-What nonsense? -Your shitty projects nonsense.
You were doing the same thing at my age.
I told her you'd say that.
Want to hear something?
With violence,
you decide when to start using it,
but you don't choose when it ends.
Sometimes I feel like Noumouké is upset with me.
I could have told the cops that he wasn't involved.
But I didn't.
He'd do it again if he had to.
What are you going to do?
I've never told anyone,
but I think I've been having panic attacks.
Yeah?
Have you seen anyone?
Seen who?
A therapist.
Me? See a therapist? Have you ever seen a Black man go to a therapist?
You're such a caricature of yourself.
It can help to talk sometimes.
Give me five.
What are you doing?
What is he doing?
-Come on. Stop. -Don't make me run.
-Don't hurt me! -Quiet!
You'll have your construction sites.
Come here! I said, come here!
So, you want to play with me? Come here!
Run, Forrest, run!
Abdou!
Stop!
Stop!
No! Demba, stop.
Calm down. It was Abdel.
Abdel and Sahli. I wasn't there.
What are you proud of?
You're proud of this?
You're fighting for that?
These buildings we grew up in.
In poverty. No elevators. Roaches.
That's what you're ready to die for?
All day long, all you say is, "No one likes us in this country."
"No one respects us."
"Fuck the state. There's no work."
"Fuck the police."
So? Of course, fuck the police.
You've got something to say?
Your eye injury,
was it the cops' fault or because of your stupid raid?
How can you expect anyone to respect us? We don't even respect one another.
Why would anyone like us?
We hate one another.
And you're always like, "I love my mother."
"I'll make her a millionaire."
You know what you're going to get her?
Your moms are here. Ask them.
A casket.
Because of your issues.
First leg. Second leg.
It's like the Champions League.
And for the one lying on the ground, it's game over.
-They come here and bust our balls. -Shut up!
Noumouké, Anis. Shake hands.
Shake hands.
We can clearly see the police officer grab the phone and throw it on the ground.
What he didn't know was that another witness was filming.
I can imagine that you decided to file a complaint against the officers?
I tried to file a complaint the day after. I had to visit two police stations.
It's common for police officers to refuse a complaint in this type of case.
Police tend to protect their own.
You have a very simplistic vision of the police corps.
I don't wake up wanting to beat up Black people and Arabs.
Why is he talking?
That may be the case for you. I don't mean to essentialize.
During the yellow jacket protests,
we saw that the violence experienced by the communities in the projects
could also be used against poor, white communities.
We aren't talking about yellow jackets in a protest right now.
This is the mother of an offender resisting her daughter's arrest.
Her daughter is incarcerated.
Once again, that is not the issue at hand.
We're not discussing her daughter's trial.
We're questioning the methods employed by police officers
that hit a woman,
a mother,
sprayed her with tear gas, and left her on the ground in pain.
The issue is the violence.
I have met with these mothers in tears
who had just lost a child.
Let me tell you one thing.
These mothers aren't worried about so-called police brutality.
It's easy to denounce
supposed police brutality.
When it comes to denouncing the violence used by these offenders,
whose victims are primarily from communities in the projects,
no one says a thing.
See you later.
He's coming out.
-Have a good day. -Have a good day.
Your book pissed me off, miss.
Is that all?
This guy works hard to become someone else, and he ends up alone.
With a bit of willpower and work, we can become whatever we want.
Not always, miss.
In life, some things are beyond us.
But we can control some things.
And maybe what the author is saying is
that it's not for other people that you should try your best.
Can I read it?
Officers are subject to quotas.
Management puts pressure on them.
And, of course, they're expected to hit their targets.
So what you are saying is
that violence committed by the police
against a targeted group within the population
is a consequence of a quota system
by the Ministry of the Interior and, therefore, the state.
You've answered our question.
Not only is the state not doing a thing to prevent police brutality,
but it's actually encouraging it.
Okay, this woman is in good health.
She's alive.
This isn't the George Floyd case in the United States.
Clearly, she didn't end up like Amine Bentounsi,
who was shot in the back.
Or suffocated, like Amadou Koumé.
In France, we have our own George Floyds. It's nothing new.
I'm always amazed by the way some people
are upset by police brutality on the other side of the Atlantic
while they remain blind, deaf, and mute about the same brutality in France.
We both know that if a neighbor hadn't filmed what happened,
Mrs. Fitoussi's words wouldn't have held up against the police officers.
She would've been portrayed as a bad mother
who couldn't even raise her daughter right, isn't that so?
But let's try to see the big picture
and not just debate back and forth.
Slow down. They'll notice us.
I'd say it's up to all of us to make the world a better place.
And we shouldn't minimize the impact our actions can have on others.
Get out of the car. Get out.
A smile, a nice word,
and kindness can change someone's day.
A single day can change the course of a life.
That's why we must all challenge ourselves
and stop repeating the same mistakes.
Idrissa!
You should bring your clothes over.
I made some space for you in the closet.
Let me!
-I was gonna do this. -No!
No, don't do that, Benny.
You told me I could set the table with Teresa. You said so.
Yeah, but I didn't want to wake you. You had to want to wake me.
I can't set it if I'm asleep.
Okay.
Come on.
Okay. One, two, three.
Higher, Benny.
-Hi! -How's my little monkey?
Mommy, they're here!
-Hi. -Hey there. Hi, Erica.
Let's go!
I'm taking my car.
Why? We can come back whenever you want.
I want to stay there for a few days.
I'm sick of Tijuana.
Whatever. Where's my brother-in-law?
He's not coming.
Babe!
I'm riding with Julia, she's taking her car.
Hand me my purse, will you?
Tomás found a condom in my purse.
Why are you carrying condoms around in your purse?
Because I'm a grown-ass bitch in charge of my own protection.
Of course.
You think that finding a condom in your wife's purse
would be a conversation starter?
No, he grabbed his backpack and left.
-Just like that. -Why was he going through your purse?
I asked him to hand me my phone. Why did you ask him to do that, Julia?
Because the subconscious is the strongest force in the universe, Rebeca.
Didn't you know?
Is that what you're wearing?
If you're going to hassle me, I'll climb back into my cozy bed.
You're going to be cold. It's not the first time he catches me.
Oh, Julia.
What? Should I wear a slut sign on my forehead to go out?
I've only cheated on him a couple of times. Three.
He found out one time, and let it slide, but with this one, he's had enough.
With Nati Botella's husband.
Come on, Julia. Why?
And it isn't really cheating, like…
They're trysts that make me feel that I'm still made of flesh and bone,
and that there's still someone who can spark my interest
and make me forget that I've been with the same guy since I was 16.
You've never had an affair?
No. Don't do it. The gringo is awesome.
-Did Amandita find out? -No!
I'm a shitty wife but a good mother.
She thinks her daddy is on a work trip.
The dude is adamant
that he's never cheated on me. He probably doesn’t need to.
Get divorced, Julia.
Come on.
Enough.
Let's go, okay?
Do you know why we're getting together one week early? I hate it.
I don't know, but I love these gatherings, and you do too.
Really?
Some things you have to adore whether you like them or not, period. That's how it is.
Okay.
Fine.
You're driving.
Damn it.
Did you tell your family that I'm coming?
No.
No. It's not like it's a wedding. We can bring whoever we want.
No. It's not like it's a wedding. We can bring whoever we want. Or whoever agrees to come.
And how will you introduce me? As your friend who is visiting from Mexico City?
-The city girl? -Well, I hadn't thought about it.
Can't you admit that you're crazy for me?
Yeah, right.
Well, it's always interesting
to barge in on a whole family this way. I might even discover the real you.
You'll fit right in, we're not complicated.
Did your mom work?
Yes. She was a writer.
She had just won an award for her first novel. An important award.
Cool.
Here we say "sick."
Sick?
That's sick, yeah.
-That's sick. -That's sick.
Hey.
How did the accident happen?
-Do you mind me asking? -No.
It was the stupidest thing. A boy on a skateboard crashed into her.
It wasn't very hard, but she fell and hit her head on the sidewalk.
-No way. -Never woke up again.
It's been almost six years.
Wow.
It's incredible how someone can vanish like that as if they never existed.
Good morning.
-Good morning. How are you? -Good morning, boss. Fine.
All we need is some wine and cheese. Good morning, Benny.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
Come in, Mr. Leo.
-Am I interrupting? -No, not at all.
I had never seen Teresa here.
She's been coming over.
All right, then.
I spoke with the lawyer. He said they're fine with the two years.
Thanks, Mr. Leo. I owe you. I owe you a shitload.
No, it's they who come out winning by keeping you on.
So, you and Teresa…
How about it? I was surprised too.
I'm running around looking, and she's here right under my nose.
That's how it goes when it happens.
How are the twins?
Insufferable.
Shit, they want everything, and they want it now.
And don’t you dare ask for anything in return 'cause they're saving the planet,
but ask them to take out the trash, and it's…
Oh.
And Alan,
Alan jacks off all the time. I almost caught him in the bathroom. He spends hours there.
Males are nothing but fucking cavemen pigs.
Erica probably masturbates all the time too. -Don't be naive. -I'm not.
-Don't be naive. -I'm not.
I heard her talking about contraceptives with her friends. Contraceptives!
When I asked her about it, you know what she said?
She said to me, "Mind your own business!"
And the way she looks at me, like I'm a thing that just popped out of a pig's ass.
It hurts, you know.
We were the same at that age, Mom would get so frustrated.
Extremely.
-No way. -Yes way!
We were very lucky to have that mother.
-And that dad too. -Yes, Beca, but they were no saints.
Mom even had an affair with that painter, Charlie Vargas.
-Well… -That really screwed Dad up.
Why do you have bring that up? It's totally irrelevant.
Because I'm a bitch.
"Bitch." I hate it when women call themselves that. I hate it.
What about Clara?
What do you think of her? Really?
-What? -Speaking of bitches?
-No, stupid. -No.
No!
I like her.
-I mean… -What is it that she researches?
The… biodiversity of marine species.
I hope it lasts.
You know how Dad is very romantic at first, and then…
Oh no.
Love lasts as long as an erection.
-Hello. -Hello.
What a belly!
So beautiful!
This is Mónica. This is Teresa, the real boss of the house.
-Pleased to meet you. -You too.
-I wish. -I need to pee.
This is Eva. She's working with us now. Don't forget the oil this time!
-Nice to meet you. -No, I promise.
-Have you been here a long time? -Yes, a very long time.
I was Mariana's nanny, and then Benny's.
Now I'm in charge of the kitchen for get-togethers.
Hi.
-Hello. -What's up, Eva, Teresa?
Hi, how are you? Mónica.
Clara. How are you? -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.
Look who's here, the moody man of the house.
-I missed you. -You did? But you saw me last night.
-Hi. -Hi. Mónica.
Mariana invited me. Nice to meet you. Leo. Welcome to the corral.
-Friend or girlfriend? -Thanks.
-What's your opinion? -What do you think?
-Girlfriend, for sure. -Why?
-Are you a magician? -I am not.
I remember everything.
Do you want some wine?
-Yes, thanks. -I'll get the glasses.
Sorry, I didn't understand why you think I am Mariana's girlfriend.
-Tell her. -What?
-Tell her! -What do you want me to tell her?
In your own words, Benny.
You look the same as the other girls who have been Mariana's girlfriends.
-Okay. -Hello.
Honey.
Hi, Dad.
Dad, what's the matter?
You are crying.
Are you sure?
Men are allowed to cry.
-Thanks. -You're welcome.
-Right? -Of course.
What can I get for you, Marianita?
Water.
For Teresa.
How are you?
-I was told… -What's up with Dad?
I don't know. He's been very sensitive lately.
Dad, are you having cramps or what?
-I think so. -Do you prefer pads or tampons?
You get on, huh? I think he uses a cup.
-What is a cup? -"What is a cup?" See?
Your dad is a troglodyte.
What is that? -A man from a different era, honey. -Like me?
-A man from a different era, honey. -Like me? You? You're from this era.
-Did you feel that? -Oh, yes.
It'll be a boy. No, it'll be a girl. I am never wrong.
-Will you tell us who the dad is now? -Oh Dad, how annoying. Who cares?
You mean fathers don't matter? Yes, but not too much.
-No, don't shut me up. -I'm not.
I'm just stopping you before you say some bullshit
about how little you value fathers.
Look.
You have the same face you had when you came out of your mom's pussy.
Really, Dad?
-The pussy. -Come on.
A toast to pussies.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
What's going on with you?
Last night, you were talking in your sleep. -Nonstop. -What did I say?
Wait, what did he say? -Don't talk about me, okay? -No.
-Don't talk about me. -Who is he?
-My brother. -No. I promise.
Well, let's say that Dad and I will go camping tonight.
Just the two of us.
-Do you guys still do that? -Yes. Benny loves it.
Liar. You like it more than I do.
I do believe that.
Hey!
We saw the worst accident ever.
-Where? -Driving by the mission.
Really?
How did it happen?
-This is Eva. -It was like…
There was a woman lying there. They pressed her chest with both hands.
-There was blood. -Hi.
Her car rolled over, and she flew out of the…
-Out of the windscreen. -Windshield.
That woman had passed us before.
I remembered because I saw her dog through the window. The dog was still there,
inside the rolled over car, as if nothing had happened.
The woman's head was covered with a sheet.
Why do they do that? They do that with dead people.
How is everyone?
-Fine! -That's great, Teresita.
-Right? -But why was the dog okay?
-Force equals mass times acceleration. -Hello, my little angel. It was a small dog, so it didn't crash hard against anything.
And I bet the lady wasn't wearing a seatbelt.
Hey, stop eating. -We'll eat soon. -Now I can't even eat.
-Where's your mom? -Good.
-She's coming with Rebeca. -How is life, gorgeous?
Grandpa, you always ask me the same thing with the same words.
What's wrong with that?
Then I always answer the same thing, and nothing means anything.
It's like, "Have a nice day."
I get it. But if something goes wrong, will you tell me even if I don't ask?
-Yes? -Did you make the fried octopus I like?
-Yes? -Did you make the fried octopus I like? I'm on it if you let me cook.
How are you, Mr. Benny?
How is the olive business? My dad is the olive superhero.
Benny says that I look like Mariana's other girlfriends.
I was shocked.
-Hey! Just a bit. -Watch out…
-How is work going, Dan? -Well. Very well.
Erica, what a pretty dress.
Oh, your dad. I love how he looks at you and the things he tells you.
He really knows how to have that effect. He's a charming, hypocritical wolf.
Are you his favorite?
Rabbit, how are your love affairs going?
The other day, I kissed a girl at a party. But I didn't feel anything special.
The other day, I kissed a girl at a party. But I didn't feel anything special. Maybe she wasn't the one, right?
No, it's me.
How did you two meet?
Go on, tell her.
Well, my mom sells a lot of the jewelry that your aunt makes,
and they dated last year.
We didn't date, we hooked up. You stole your mom's girlfriend?
-No. -Yes.
Nobody can say no to your aunt.
Mariana, you have no boundaries. What did she say?
She didn't even notice.
-She has a long waiting list, and… -Her mom is very modern.
-No, modern… -Look who is coming.
My mom.
-Hi! -Hello, tribe.
-What's up? -Hi.
-Hi, how are you? -Hi.
Hi. How are you, Teresa?
-Welcome. -Thank you.
-Come and give Dad a big hug. -Did you see the accident?
-No, what accident? -A woman got killed.
Fuck, stop it. We've already talked about it.
I wasn't the one who started.
What got into you? Did you check your blood pressure?
My blood pressure is fine. Can't I be in a bad mood occasionally?
I wish it were only occasionally.
-Look who's talking, Miss Moody. -Nice to meet you, Rebeca.
-Grandpa. -Yes?
I'm learning tap dancing. Wanna see? I brought my shoes.
-Yes, put them on. -Okay.
Please take two each morning.
Saltines. Binge on them.
They're great for water retention too.
What's up, Dad?
How are you?
Benny, come here.
-Vitamin B12. -Stop it!
-Tell me everything… -Which is your favorite?
Alan, what's up?
Aren't you going to greet me? Do I have to make an appointment?
First you yell at me, and now you want me to greet you. Stop it, please.
Can't you put that phone down five minutes?
-The world won't end without you. -It just might, you know.
Alan.
-Enough. -He loves playing stupid with me.
Why do you have to be the rudest grandfather?
You two, Spanish. Only Spanish. You two, Spanish.
You two, Spanish.
Stop frowning, Rebeca. You'll get more wrinkles.
-You'll see. -Just wait until I get my hands on you.
Are you mad because I treated you like a baby in front of your girlfriend?
It's the least you've done in the last five minutes.
I apologize.
Listen up, Dad is apologizing! Rebeca. Dad is apologizing!
Miracles do happen!
Cut the shit. I do apologize, don't I, Clara?
I wish you didn't have to do it so often.
Tickle, tickle, tickle!
Stop it!
Let me cook!
You heard, everybody outside right now! Let's go!
-I won't be able to finish the meal. Go! -Dan.
Ready, Granddad.
Stop, wait.
Come dance in the patio.
It sounds better on the kitchen floor.
-Oh, please. -Dan, help me.
-Yes, but… -Don't exaggerate.
-Play some music. -Here?
-Pay attention. -Shake it, cousin!
Let's see.
How long have you had this ranch?
My grandfather inherited it from his dad, who was this Quixotic Spaniard.
A terrible businessman.
Alcoholic.
A closeted gay, according to Mariana.
He almost bankrupted the ranch, so my dad took over when he was young.
I barely remember my grandparents. I have a few scattered images.
They were stern,
they were quite stern.
Too much information is my favorite thing.
In that case, you'll feel right at home here.
Meaning?
What the hell, that's how we interact.
It's true.
I wish you could inherit the talent for a good marriage.
How's your writing coming along?
I haven't done anything in months. I think it's time for me to set that aside.
I'm not a writer, I'm not. Period.
Giving up on your marriage and on writing…
Hell of a week.
I'm not chastising myself thinking I'm not talented. I am.
But I don't have the discipline
to overcome my insecurity and self-sabotaging, which I'm so good at.
Why do artists always think
their work is the hardest thing on earth?
Because we expose ourselves.
Everybody exposes themselves. That's called living.
Sometimes I think I pretend to be a poet just to impress Mom.
You just now realized this?
Is it that obvious?
I could tell when you were nine. I'm going to have to reinvent myself.
We'll see about that.
Wow.
Thanks for the support.
I can always say, "Yes,
you can free yourself from your chains."
You'll do it or you won't.
We'll see.
I could move back and help you.
I can do my translation work from here.
What?
I know lots about olives.
You wouldn't last a month.
I'm going to water this tree.
Don't let Benny see you.
I have an idea.
You wanna hear it? Yes.
I love hearing the ideas of a man holding his dick.
Why don't you write about your mom's death?
How do you know I haven't? Women's intuition.
A writer has to go where it hurts. Remember your mother used to say that?
Hey, you stud. -Give me back my girlfriend. -Who? Him or me?
-You. -Are you talking to him or to me?
The Phantom of the Opera? You?
Me?
Face the consequences. What Phantom of the Opera?
That's him.
-What? What's up with you? -What? Are you gonna keep yelling at me?
I have my reasons.
Maybe because you only get along with women, right?
You stepped on poop.
-No, I didn't. -Yes, you did.
He gets on my nerves. Everything he says annoys me. He's such a gringuito.
He's the only one who doesn't bow to you.
-Alpha males always clash. -I'm not an alpha male.
-Really? -Really.
My universe spins around women,
and around Benny.
Thanks for taking such good care of him.
You know I'm fond of him. Don't say that.
And of me?
Are you competing with Benny? Over you, with anyone.
Wow! The lion roars.
This tableware is beautiful.
-My mom made it. -Really?
-Who made these? -My braids?
-Yeah -Mom.
They're ugly.
-No, they're pret-- Ouch! -Undo them.
Are you hungry? Your mom can't braid.
-Thank you! -Look how delicious!
-Wow! -Teresa!
-Their favorite. -Oh!
What a suck-up!
Amanda!
I always make the same thing.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
Wow, that seafood platter looks…
Family!
Family! Hey!
There's an important thing I want to tell you. Well, two important things.
Don't start crying again, Dad.
So what if I do? You're scared to see that I'm human?
The lion is sharp.
Alan, my only male son… Grandson.
…made me see that I mistreat him for no logical reason.
And he's right, I'm constantly screwing with you.
I react violently to everything you do.
and I don't do that with the women of the family.
Not that they don't do anything to get on my nerves. On the contrary.
But I promise I'll stop.
I will try to understand why I do it.
Please accept my sincere apology.
You're a good young boy,
and…
it takes balls…
or ovaries, to confront the person who attacks you.
You have my respect. To Alan.
Cheers, Grandpa.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
Why are you so apologetic? Are you dying?
We are all dying.
Are we dying?
No, he's joking. We're not dying.
-Enjoy. -Enjoy.
-Thanks. -Enjoy.
I want…
to pray.
He must have seen it on TV. Or someone teach him?
If that's what Benny wants, we can. Stop talking about me like I'm not here.
I saw it on TikTok.
O angel of God, my holy guardian,
thank you for this table full of food.
Don't let anything bad happen to anyone.
Amen.
-Amen. -Amen.
-Well done, filthy little rat. -Thanks.
-Poisonous snake. -That's it!
Here's the shrimp.
What was the other thing you wanted to tell us?
Do you want shrimp?
We got an offer from RT Foods for the whole hog.
What whole hog?
The land, the olive groves, the mill, the bottling, everything.
They already bought the Colios' vineyard, the Rovirosas' farm.
Only the Lagos Family and Memo Betancourt refuse to sell.
He's doing well with his new products and exporting them.
That bastard has a genius for business.
Some bastards are lucky.
RT Foods is a huge Chinese company.
-Are we up for sale? -No.
We're not up for sale.
Then I'll tell them we're not interested, and that's it.
-What's the offer? -No. Listen…
We agreed we don't want to sell, especially not to a foreign company.
Since when do you dislike foreigners so much?
I don't think we'll do it if you disagree, Beca. Will we?
Who else knows about this?
I was waiting
until the offer was a fact.
-I already knew. -Well, he heard me.
I was talking on the phone. I told him a bit.
-I can keep a secret. -Right.
-So it was a secret. -Relax, Beca. Don't get hysterical.
Look,
I was waiting until I could gather all the information.
-There's that tone. -Yes.
I know that tone. You are manipulating us.
Yes, she's right. You are manipulating us. What fucking tone?
"What fucking tone?"
What tone do you want me to use?
Are we going to be rich?
We already are. No, we are not.
Well, not compared to your friends in Coronado.
But compared to most people in the world…
Listen, who owns everything?
Leonardo. The Lion.
What's the offer?
First,
let me explain this clearly.
And it's not that I'm manipulating you,
but you need to know the whole scenario, okay?
We've almost completely paid off the loans we requested during the pandemic.
In about five years, we'll pay off the mortgage on the land I used as guarantee.
We have very high operating expenses, monthly payments for the machinery.
We'd have to pay taxes from the sale, back utilities,
permits, lawyers, and one or two bribes,
but above all, pay the company what I owe to it.
Why do you owe money to it?
Because of the remodeling your mom did on the house, for example.
The big kitchen.
Helping Rebeca pay for her medical school in the States.
The down payment on your house.
-Your poetry book. -That wasn't so much.
A new car for Mariana, which she crashed
after the insurance, which she didn't pay, expired.
-Another down payment for a new car. -I'll pay back everything.
The weddings.
Well, but…
Didn't you say that the business made good profits?
Yes, but it is never enough.
Shit. Now I feel guilty.
One day, you will do worse things for your children, believe me.
Things you won't even dare admit to.
Hey,
what about the horses?
Hey.
I hadn't thought about that.
We'll see. I don't know.
-How much is the offer? -Yes, spit it out.
Around $220,000 dollars each.
Divided among five. I'll manage Benny's share.
I have a share.
That's ridiculous. All of this is worth much more.
-Don't you agree, Dan? -It depends.
-Do you have other offers? -Yes.
What the hell? Why didn't you say so?
Because I hadn't even considered them until RT Foods agreed to my conditions.
Controlling the layoffs.
Otoniel will remain as foreman for at least two years.
There were other offers. Your mother wanted to sell when Mariana finished high school.
Mom wanted to sell?
"Extra virgin olive oil."
Sounds nice, doesn't it? Like artisanal wines and signature cuisine.
We produce things for people to come to the valley and spend a luxurious weekend.
But there's no luxury for us. It's a shitload of hard work.
That's why none of you stayed on. And I don't blame you, okay?
I'm sick
of always being two bad harvests away from bankruptcy.
What will you do with your life?
Well, I have a couple of ideas
for a new business.
Clara,
what do you think?
You didn't know about this?
-First time hearing about it. -I don't want to decide without you.
Leo, I know you like to talk openly, like in an auditorium,
but I'd rather talk about our matters privately. No offense.
Can we keep coming even if the trees are no longer ours?
The offer includes the house.
They're going to tear it down.
They're planting vineyards
in this whole area.
Did you like the seafood, Mónica?
Yes, it's delicious, thank you.
It's one of the best oils we've produced yet. Light but...
spicy too.
Maybe…
If our votes count for anything, I vote not to sell.
Does our vote count? Of course it does.
We'll only sell if we all agree. Well, we don't.
Can't we sell everything but the house?
I can ask.
We could keep it as a vacation home for all of us.
You expect Teresa to wait here like a statue for us to come visit?
Her ceviche truck is doing very well. She's looking for a bigger place.
Oh, and besides…
No. She should tell you herself.
I'd like to spend the summer here with Amanda.
With Daddy.
Of course.
If we accept, we have 90 days to hand over everything, so that…
That wouldn't be possible.
Discuss it among yourselves.
We have until Wednesday to decide.
Oh Dad.
What? Well, it is what it is. If we keep only the house, we'd have to keep paying property taxes,
which just increased, water, electricity…
We'd need to find someone to look after it.
I can't afford all that. Not even if we shared the cost.
So we can vote, but we really have no choice.
-No. -Yes.
We can keep everything and I continue managing the business,
but keeping just the house is a luxury.
What luxury?
You were born in this house.
We grew up in this house.
I married Dan here, we made the twins here.
That's gross.
Hey, how do you make twins?
We scattered Mom's ashes on the 300-year-old olive tree.
Mom isn't there anymore.
Rain mixed Mom's ashes with the soil,
and the trees sucked them up and they became olives.
Kids,
would you come over the weekend with your friends?
No. This place puts everyone in a bad mood.
-That isn't true. -You complain on the way back.
-Everything is always about Grandma. -We don't talk about her all the time.
Why talk about her? She's a ghost-- My mom is not a ghost!
Dan, what do you think?
Well,
given the scenario,
selling the ranch wouldn't be crazy.
Don't you complain about coming here?
Sometimes it isn't easy.
Mom,
you do like coming here, right?
Yes, I do. I love it.
So explain it to me, Dad.
Does this house give you a bad vibe now, is that it?
Well, yes.
The fact is, at my age, I'm haunted everywhere.
What do you mean?
I am 65. Just hearing that number stuns me.
And I know that the 60s are the new 50s, and the 70s are the new 60s.
But no matter how hard I try to live in the present, everything pulls me back to the past.
Every day I catch myself lost deep in thought
about my parents.
I think about them
about their impact on my life.
About the impressive towers they were for me.
For better and for worse.
I recall them as two giants
when they were 20 years younger than I am now.
I understand them better than ever.
I love them more than ever.
And I forgive them more than ever.
What do you forgive them for?
For everything parents have to be forgiven.
Their contradictions,
their impatience,
their deafness.
Their sorrows. I have nothing to forgive you for, Dad.
I am just saying that things happen, and we should let them happen.
I want to live in the present.
So, the answer to your question is yes. This house is history.
I think it's great that you want to live in the present.
Maybe you will finally stop showing everyone those photos of when we were little.
-It's not the same thing. -No?
-Isn't that living in the past? -No. It's not the same thing.
Your faces when you were little give me uncomplicated pleasure.
A pleasure that asks nothing in return. What pleasure do we bring you now?
I want to know that too.
Stop it. I think Clara and Mónica have had enough, right?
No. I don't doubt it.
Look at him.
Well,
I see the best and the worst of your mother and of myself in you girls.
Charming and complicated.
Sensible and dramatic.
Your life choices have been, generally speaking, admirable,
although, at times, horrific.
In any case,
your faces are still to me, the perfect landscape.
What a poet.
Clara, do you have children? No. I chose not to.
Why does everybody get so tense when a woman says
she never wanted to have children? Aren't we really liberal here? Like…
Did you get the residency at the research center?
-That way you could live in Mexico, right? -I'm working on it.
That's great.
Hey, I think there is more ceviche in the kitchen.
-I'll get it. -Will you?
Thanks, Benny.
Me too. I love you.
Thanks, Benny.
Bring some tostadas.
Dad, haven't you thought
that leaving the house would be very hard for Benjamín?
He has all his routines here.
Yes, I’ve considered it, and it worries me.
But I think he will adapt.
Ask him. See what he says.
This will cause him another sense of loss.
Listen, the plan is to have Eva come with us.
She's been here for several weeks.
Benny likes her,
doesn't he?
Leo.
All right.
You've given us very logical arguments to sell.
-But something's weird. I feel-- -What?
I feel you're confronting us because--
-All I'm doing… -But it seems like--
Let me speak, damn it! Don't yell at me!
-Calm down, Dad. -For fuck's sake!
What more do you want from me?!
Tell me!
Tell me how you want me to be so I don't upset the ladies!
How do you want me to be? What more do you want from me? Tell me!
Tell me!
Tell me how to tell you nicely that our only choice
is to toss all we have into the crapper!
But if there's something we can do--
Yeah? And who is going to do it? You?
Because it won't be me.
Will you fucking grow up?
That was really ugly, Leonardo.
Really ugly.
Leave me alone.
Erica, come here.
Come on, it's all right.
Relax, Grandpa.
Otherwise, you'll have a heart attack, and we'll have to bury you here,
and then we really won't be able to sell the ranch.
What a screamer!
Mónica.
What do you do? Tell us about yourself.
What would you like to know?
Anything you want. Whatever you want to share.
I'm a photographer.
I'm preparing my first solo show,
and I'm completely in love with your daughter.
Totally.
-That's great. -Isn't it?
Lovely.
And I'd never been with a pregnant woman. So now it's your fetish?
What's a fetish?
It's when someone falls in love with something of a person, a part of their body.
Dad says you have pretty hands. That's why he's always kissing them.
Just like the four of you.
From wild animal to sweet dove. I thought Mom was the drama queen.
What's it like, Clara? To be with such a strange creature?
Strange creatures are my expertise, but as far as your dad…
I'm still studying him.
Leo isn't strange.
He's passionate.
Well, Dan. -Thank you very much. -I've learned a lot from you.
Like how to roar like a beast?
No, I mean, I didn't have a mom or dad,
so I never knew how parents handle their children,
and how children handle parents.
For your daughters, everything you say is very important.
Even if they're all adults.
But that has helped me with my children.
How and when to be firm with them.
You didn't have parents growing up? My mother was a teenage addict.
And my Dad, we never knew who he was.
You're a fantastic father.
-Amazing. -Sometimes.
-Yes. -Hey!
And I think
that selling this house would be sad for me.
I've felt something here that I'd never felt before.
-Belonging. -Belonging.
Now, I am a part of this…
-This package. -Package.
Forever.
It all began with a girl I met in a hospital elevator.
The love of my life.
Grandpa!
My mom and I are leaving. Bye!
Wait.
Don't go.
I'm leaving you alone.
Amanda, let me talk to your mom, okay? No, we're leaving.
Move.
Will you let me tell you something?
I screwed up.
I exploded.
This is too much for me too.
If you two go, the whole day will be worth shit.
Stay, please.
You exhaust me, Leo.
I believe you.
I exhaust myself too.
I don't want to go.
Okay, then.
Honey.
Just one more thing, between you and I.
Do you girls like Clara?
-Wow. -What?
You never ask if we like your girlfriends.
I am asking now.
We like her a lot.
The important thing is for her to like you, and to keep liking you.
is for her to like you, and to keep liking you. And that takes a real woman.
What?
Sell.
-Amanda. -Yes?
-Sit with your grandpa. -Okay.
-What did I miss? -Nothing.
I was asking Benny what he thought about selling the house.
I want to be wherever Dad is.
You don't care if we lose the house forever?
I'm staying with Dad.
-Yes, but what would happen if-- -He's already answered you.
How is school going, Benny?
B-O-R-I-N-G!
Is there a pretty girl around?
Do you have a secret girlfriend?
Spill the beans, Clara!
Spill the beans!
I'm spending summer at a really cool school with cabins.
Where?
-Where is it? -In Tecate.
Was it your idea, Dad?
No, it was my idea.
I want to be independent.
All right.
Dad, may I go play Roblox?
Amanda, I bet you your dessert. Not the dessert.
You're losing it one way or another.
May I?
Amandita.
Okay.
-But not the dessert. -Hey, you two! We have rules at the table. Put those down.
All right, you can check your online life. But come back for dessert.
-Your plate, monkey. -What am I doing?
Rabbit, give me a kiss here.
Come. Come here.
Mariana, why did you ask if the new school was my idea?
Just because.
I thought it was part of the theory where I make all the decisions alone.
And don't you?
-Wow. -What?
Such prejudice.
Let's talk about prejudice. What's your problem with me having this baby on my own?
I don't have a problem with it.
You can't stand that the dad isn't in the movie.
I watched the movie up to the part where you said you didn't want to date men.
Mónica,
what do you think about the mysterious pregnancy?
Stop it.
-I'm intrigued. -Stop it.
I like to think that fathers matter, but fine, I'll shut up.
This father wants nothing to do with it. Who the hell wouldn't want to belong to this tribe?
There's something else bothering you.
What's that?
You hate having to be the paternal figure to yet another person, especially at this stage of your life.
I finally left you speechless.
-And what's your dad like, Clara? -Ugh.
Absent.
He's an absent father.
And suddenly,
attentive.
And suddenly, absurdly generous.
But you couldn't allow yourself to hate him.
After each let-down, he always came back with something wonderful.
He's old now. He has Alzheimer's.
When I visit him in Madrid he doesn't recognize me but…
he stares at me long and deep,
as if my face brings him some kind of memory.
At first, that used to get on my nerves, but not anymore. Now
I see him,
and I get lost in his blue eyes.
Time stops, and I don't know who the father is and who the daughter is.
It's just the two of us, floating.
When it's time for me to go, he grabs my arm.
As if…
As if he suddenly
knew who I was. He doesn't. He says, "Don't go."
I think it is his instinct yelling,
"Don't abandon me. Don't forget me."
How about your mom?
Indestructible.
Mine is indestructible too. And she is her own world.
Sorry.
Hello.
Yes, come on over.
-What was that? -You'll see.
You're scaring me.
No, it's good news, but it's not my place to tell you.
About what? Your sale of the house?
My sale?
The three of you have to discuss it.
What if we can't agree? If the majority wants to sell, we'll sell.
But if it is two against two, with Benny and I voting together, then we won't sell.
Agreed?
Danny boy!
Bring the champagne bottles that are in the fridge, please. And glasses. Ask Eva.
Listen.
If we sell, what would you do with the money?
Just out of curiosity.
Well…
It's a lot of money, but not enough to change our lives.
For me, it would be enough to reset myself.
Reset from what?
I don't want to save my marriage.
Again. I've hurt Tomás enough.
I shouldn't have married him to begin with.
Anyway, I'm getting a divorce…
and that money will come in handy.
What about you?
Little chicken?
Hello? I'll be a single mom.
I have a shitload of things to use the money on.
But…
Well, I…
With this surprising news about the house sale, I hadn't…
Let's see…
I applied to become the head of the Anesthesiology Department
at Saint Francis Hospital in Chicago.
I got it.
The good news is
that Dan can continue handling his company's investments remotely.
So…
Well, the twins aren't thrilled about the idea, but…
it's Chicago.
It's great.
-Wow. -The fact is…
No, we don't really need the money right now.
-I don't know. -Beca!
Wow!
When?
In August.
Rebeca, but how often will you come? Chicago is very far away.
Every month, month and a half. Like we always do for our lunches.
-That's unrealistic. -Where there's a will, there's a way.
Congratulations, honey.
They're here.
What is this?
-What's up with you two? -No, Teresa!
No! Teresa!
You know Otoniel.
He asked me to marry him.
And I said, "Okay."
Everybody was keeping secrets today.
He had been charming me, and then it dawned on me.
Isn't my Otoniel handsome?
Don't even answer that.
Hey, what happened?
Teresa is marrying Otoniel!
-Yes! -Thanks.
-Show me the ring. -Finally.
"Finally!"
You must wear a suit.
Show us your dress.
-Awesome. -Congratulations, Otoniel.
Oh, I'm so happy. I'll design some really cool earrings for you.
Hey, pass the glasses around.
This occasion calls for a good toast.
-Congratulations. -Here.
-Thanks. -Teresa.
Thanks.
Every couple is a miracle.
Two strangers that find each other among millions.
You're meant for me, I'm meant for you.
And we often wonder,
"How did you meet?"
"What was the first thing you felt when you met him?"
"How did you know that she would marry you?" Right?
We never get bored of those stories.
Because they're reflections of a desire,
the desire to share a life together.
The desire to plant your own trees together.
Teresa,
you've known my daughters since they were kids.
They have always loved you.
And they've always felt loved by you. For them, you have been much more than…
Do you remember when Rebeca asked you what oral sex was?
-No, Dad! -Yes.
-Don't say what… -Dad.
-What would you know? -Sorry!
-You can't even talk, Benjamín. -Okay.
Yes, sure.
With respect to Benny, well…
What can I say?
Thank you.
Otoniel, you are honest,
you're hardworking.
And you are very patient, which is very useful around here.
Love is a prayer.
I hope yours is heard. Cheers.
-Cheers! -Cheers!
-Thank you very much, Mr. Leo. Cheers. -Cheers.
Cheers!
-Cheers. -Congratulations. Cheers.
My back.
Where's your girl? She's over there reading one of Mom's books.
Is she your girlfriend or just your current fling?
What's the difference?
You're unbelievable!
Pretty secretive about your new job.
Will you be here when the alien is born, bitch?
Of course I will.
I didn't want to say anything until things were a fact.
That's exactly what Leo said. Did you notice?
There's Benny.
He's still the same old Benny.
Has Dad said anything about when he's unable to take care of him?
It will happen.
I'll take over.
-From Chicago? -I'll take him with us.
To Chicago or wherever I am.
-You didn't think of asking us? -Would it rather be you?
Because with the money you have, you can't support his needs for the rest of his life.
I'll do it, if Benny wants me to.
Although I rather not. I'm fucking selfish.
-You're right about that. -Asshole.
What about you?
Yes, I'd jump in and take over, if Benny wants me to.
But I'm the one he's been around the least. She's already backpedaling.
Why don't you hand him over to Mother Clara?
-He already loves her more than us. -That's bullshit.
When Benny was born, I was already married and pregnant with the twins.
-I didn't live here either. -Well, I did.
-I didn't live here either. -Well, I did. That's how I know what it’s like.
Benny is great, I adore him, but he's a huge responsibility.
-All children are. -No, Rebeca.
-No, Rebeca. -Yes, they are.
Benny is a constant weight on your chest.
Mom had a hard time dealing with it.
No she didn't! Mom was all in for Benny. She drooled over him.
She drooled over him.
So?
You always act like you're the one with the clearest vision of things, Juli.
Baby! Saying "always" and "never" deflates affirmations.
-Really? -There she is.
That's Mom talking. Right?
You can't hear Mom…
She's dead.
-What did I say? -Give me some.
-And buckle your seatbelts. -Leave me alone!
Remember when we got totally wasted at Papa's & Beer in Rosarito,
Remember when we got totally wasted at Papa's & Beer in Rosarito, and Rebeca flashed her boobs at the bouncer?
And the dude went, "That's not necessary. Come on in."
No way, he loved it. I had great boobs back then.
Look at her now, Lady Boobs in the States.
I'm the boss, dude.
I'm going to have to handle some huge egos.
Sometimes when I see a patient, as they fall asleep with the anesthesia,
I feel so envious.
To go under like that,
in peace.
Just one day, man.
A single day, with nobody hassling me.
Don't let the twins see me like this.
No, don't let them see me like this.
Now I'm the Head of Anesthesiology.
Remember Pili Vildósola?
The lawyer? I ran into her the other day at the supermarket.
She walked up to me and hugged me, like we were kindergarten friends.
The first thing she said: "How's Leo?"
-No, she didn't. -Yes.
Show us now.
What?
Yeah.
Show us.
"So how's Leo?" Perfect.
Every time she said "Leo," her face lit up. He fucked her. I'm sure.
Come on!
Dad leant me the car once,
and I found a photo of that broad between the seat and the hand brake.
I was going to ask him, but it was obvious. And? What did you do with the photo?
And? What did you do with the photo? I left it on Mom's pillow.
-No! -What?
-No! -What? -I ripped it up, of course, dumbass. -Asshole.
-I ripped it up, of course, dumbass. -Asshole. That doesn't mean he fucked her. You're jumping to conclusions.
-That is bullshit. -No. Right. Maybe she only sucked him off.
I'm sure our parents were getting a divorce. Nonsense, they adored each other.
-You idealize them. -No.
-You idealize them. -Not at all.
-You idealize them. -Not at all. My children are my gods.
My parents are more like…
a cult.
So I told Leo, "I ran into Pili Vildósola."
Just to see his face. He didn't say a word. He seemed sad.
He didn't say a word. He seemed sad.
And then he said…
"She's a great woman."
Hey!
That Pili Vildósola woman showed up at Mom's funeral
wearing a low neckline, and her boobs hanging out.
Remember? That bitch.
-That damn bitch. -Why didn't he stay with her?
Can't you see that he's still in love with Mom?
Poor Clara.
Oh, yeah. Whatever.
What about you? Seriously.
How are you doing?
I'm scared to death.
First I have to figure out how I'm gonna get this melon out. without bursting my cooch.
I dreamed that I forgot to feed the baby.
And then I remembered and ran to the crib, which I haven't bought yet,
and it was still alive.
But it was just a lump of flesh and bones
covered by ants devouring it.
Instead of being pissed off and wailing over my abandonment,
it looked at me and smiled as if I were the most beautiful thing ever.
Which made me feel even shittier.
Relax.
One step at a time.
If it's hungry, you feed it. If it's sleepy, you rock it to sleep.
If it shits, you change the diaper, and so on.
And then you lock yourself up in the bathroom to cry.
Chicken Little.
-Tell us who the father is. -The Holy Spirit! Stop it!
Mariana.
Enough!
Memo Betancourt.
What?
You fucking bitch.
That's they way things go when they go. You can't deny the geezer is hot.
You can't deny the geezer is hot. He's Dad's biggest competitor, even if he denies it.
He hates him, and you know it!
-How old is he? -61.
Holy shit, Mariana!
-That's gross. -But he fucks like a 30-year-old.
-Is he married? -No.
He's not married, and I'm nobody's mistress. No offense.
Does he have kids? He's three times divorced with six kids.
-He has six kids? -Yes, Rebeca, he has six kids!
-Does he take care of them? -Yes, he takes care of them, Rebeca.
That jerk doesn't want to take care of this one.
Oh, Mariana. Shit.
Sis, I can't believe this.
I can't believe this.
You haven't told him you're pregnant.
You haven't said anything?
Shit. What are you doing? Whatever the fuck I feel like!
Okay?
That's what I'm doing! Aren't I the owner of my own body?!
Apparently. All I've ever wanted in life were two things!
Dad's approval, and not needing Dad's approval.
-My dad's approval-- -That's enough!
I'm terrified about what will happen when he finds out.
You should be.
Even worse, about…
how I'll react at his reaction.
I'm glad!
-I'm terrified of myself. -I thought you didn't like men.
-I'm terrified of myself. -I thought you didn't like men. Not for life partners, but they're okay for a fuck.
-That's what you call a fuck? -He texted me, Rebeca!
He was very bold, I liked it, and it happened. And…
-and it happened. -Fuck!
Here comes your chick.
Am I interrupting? No. We're only killing each other here.
No. We're only killing each other here. Just kidding.
Listen, your mother is an incredible writer.
Are you crying?
It's the hormones.
I read this story…
-Which one? -"Losses."
-It's the best one. -It rattled me.
My favorite is "The Wolves."
Listen to this…
"Loss like a mind-blowing shriek which never stops,
and hope like a maddening and debilitating addiction."
I get goose bumps.
I should re-read all her work.
Why are writers so obsessed with death?
Not with death, with loss.
She had happy stories too.
-Not if you read them carefully. -Stop it, Julia!
You're always explaining our parents to us.
-Try explaining yourself. -I'm not explaining anything.
Rebeca's the one who holds the official version of Mom and Leo.
"Leo." He's not your buddy. He's your dad.
Mom hated it too when you called him by his name.
Really? Did she tell you that on her deathbed?
Why does the truth frighten you so much?
I don't mind the truth, I mind your truth. It makes me feel like shit.
I don't mind the truth, I mind your truth. It makes me feel like shit. You've made us feel like shit since forever.
You've made us feel like shit since forever. Enough! That's it!
Why are you fighting? We're not fighting.
-You were yelling. -Yes. We were fighting.
It's normal not to agree sometimes and get angry.
You and I fight sometimes and it's all right.
But not like this. This yelling was more like you and Dad.
Where's Granddad?
Listening to his music and smoking.
What song is he listening to today?
It goes,
I need to know…
So, where did you leave your brother?
With Benny. Clara.
-You're sick of us, aren't you? -Almost.
Do you think Dad won't sell if all of us don't agree?
Well, I think your father is a man of his word.
What's he like as a boyfriend?
-You don't have to answer that. -But I beg you to do it.
All right.
At first,
that thing your father does of overprotecting and treating me as if I were made of porcelain,
of overprotecting and treating me as if I were made of porcelain,
it got on my nerves a bit.
But then I got to understand him.
He respects the way I am and the way I think. My obsession with my job.
Also, my insufferable tantrums, proper of a single child,
Also, my insufferable tantrums, proper of a single child, a spoiled brat.
He tries with all his soul for me to feel loved.
And he achieves it.
What's he like as far as…
conversations go?
No, don't.
-Why not? -Don't.
What's wrong with me asking Clara
what Dad is like in… conservation?
Grandfather has very good conversations.
Doesn't he?
-Or what were you talking about? -About that.
About that your grandfather has…
very vigorous conversations.
Yes, I could even say he's very… creative.
It runs in the family.
Hey, I remembered more lyrics.
"It's nighttime, and I need to know…"
Party's over.
Let's go, Chimis.
Granddad! We're leaving.
Come on, Mom.
Granddad! We're leaving. I'm coming!
-Go to the bathroom first. -Don't forget your tablet.
Take care, little monkey.
I'm very proud of you. Really. I'll ask for…
I feel like a traitor for going away. Children betray their parents in order to survive.
Goodbye.
Captain, next weekend I have to come to Tijuana.
I'll drop by so we can have a few mezcals, just you and me. Just the two of us?
-See you soon, Captain. -Goodbye.
-Erica. -Please take care of my dad.
Erica, when will you bring a boyfriend so I can scare him off with my shotgun?
I'll bring two and keep the one you don't like. I'll keep the other one.
Listen. Remember what we said?
Listen. Remember what we said? If anything is wrong, you'll let me know?
Yes.
Thank you.
-It was a pleasure. -Everything was great.
-Thanks for everything. -No, thank you.
See you, Leo.
You’re gonna call me by my name too!
Okay, stop. I give up, I give up.
Hey.
Why don't you spend your summer holiday here before Chicago?
For the harvest, you have a good palate.
-I can't, Grandfather. -Why not?
-I can't, Grandfather. -Why not? I'm taking flying lessons.
Flying lessons? I want to be a pilot.
Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man Bake me a cake as fast as you can…
Tiny dancer, when will I see you again?
Mom and I are spending the night here, Grandpa.
-Beat it, then. -Leo. Thank you for everything. I loved meeting you.
Thank you for everything. I loved meeting you. Everything, your home, your olives…
That sounded strange. Really…
Thank you very much.
You’re welcome here over anytime.
I mean it.
What's this old wolf saying to you?
-I'm not telling you. -You’re two of a kind.
I'll talk to my sisters and call you on Tuesday night.
-Never at night. -Come on, Dad.
-Let's go, little grasshopper. -Let's.
-Bye! -Where's my kiss?
It's a boy, and I'm naming him Leo.
-Your Uber is here, sir. -I'm not leaving.
-It was so nice of you to come. -I said I'm staying.
-I'm not going anywhere! -You can get into your Uber now.
-You can get in your… -Leo.
I'm kidding, son.
Bye!
That's it. Ladies, time to rest.
It's been a very long day.
I gave you Eva's pay, right?
Yes, it's all covered. Thank you.
Thank both of you.
It was a pleasure.
Look, you're learning Spanish from listening to us.
-A bit more. -Take this food with you, Eva.
Thank you so much, Teresa.
Thanks for the toast. We love both of you.
You want a ride to the shelter? Otoniel and I are taking her.
Everything all right?
You remind me of my dad.
He must be a very handsome man, then.
-No. -No?!
He was a union leader.
He loved his country.
He was murdered.
I'm so sorry.
Ready?
-See you tomorrow, Mr. Leo. -See you tomorrow.
Thank you.
Mar.
Mar.
We're here.
That was quick.
It was strange when you and your dad said you would talk, and he said, "Never at night."
Because he doesn't like to make decisions after the sun goes down.
He says that in the morning light you can see everything more clearly.
He's never selling the ranch.
And you?
Will you be with me when this baby is born?
Do you want me to be with you?
Yeah.
And then, what?
I don't know. I can't tell the future.
I don't care about the future.
I care about you in the present. What do you want?
Are you proposing that we live as a family?
Or what?
My sisters exasperate me.
I miss them and I adore them, but after a while with them…
Mariana isn't well.
I'm worried about her.
She can’t handle the…
That…
And then Julia.
She's not getting a divorce. Ever.
She keeps Amandita in a constant state of anguish
not knowing if her dad is going to be home when she gets there.
It's pathetic.
She wants to be a writer, but without the rigor,
She wants to be a writer, but without the rigor, without the sweat or criticism.
And when she's okay, she can be the most charming person on the planet.
Fuckin' Julia.
She was Mom's favorite.
Your dad…
I’m gonna miss the ranch.
Thanks for putting up with my tribe.
It's a great tribe.
With them, there's no peace of mind.
What worries you the most?
That their lives may not turn out right.
That's not in your hands, Leo.
By thinking everything will go wrong,
later I can be surprised at how well things turn out.
You know I'm a corny optimist.
What's wrong?
Let's take some time off and we'll talk afterwards, okay?
Okay…
What's this about?
Are you breaking up with me?
I really don't know.
I don't know.
So, what happened?
Tell me, I can take it.
Your world is precious, and I am truly envious.
But sometimes I also feel like
it's a bit overwhelming.
I'm just asking for some time.
All right?
Sleep in this bed. That one's too small.
No, we can fit here! Yes!
I call dibs on Grandpa’s side.
You know your mom used to climb into this bed every night -until she turned nine? -Really?
-until she turned nine? -Really?
Yes, and she kicked us all night in her asleep.
That's not true.
Then she stopped doing it. It was sad.
Ready.
See you at breakfast.
-Waffles! -Waffles!
It's your dad.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, pretty girl.
When are you coming home?
I don't know. I'll tell you on Monday, okay?
Hey, how was the get-together?
Did everybody go? Yes, and Mariana brought a new girlfriend.
Guess what.
Grandfather wants to sell the ranch, the house, the trees. Everything.
Seriously?
Wow.
Yeah, it's crazy.
Mom said we could go to Europe with the money…
-No, Amanda stop. -…and do things we've never done before.
That's cool.
I love you to infinity and beyond, Daddy. I love you too, my pretty girl.
Daddy wants to talk to you.
I want to say something,
but I feel bad about saying it.
You better say it and get it off your mind
or you won't be able to sleep.
Sometimes I feel like my sisters aren't my sisters.
They're my aunts,
and I don't like it.
We'll get together with them more often, maybe that will change.
-What do you say? -Okay.
Benny.
You're not going to leave me, are you?
S… U… N
S… H… I… N… E.
-Sunshine. -Good job!
Daddy, are there a lot of friends at school?
-Yes, sweetie! -I’m going to miss you so much!
I’ll see you every ten days, alright?
Every ten days, you promise?
Flowers!
Daddy…
Woah… flying elephants…
Argh… Why couldn't I catch this salamander…?
I… I'm sorry.
It was my fault.
Please allow me… to take care of An.
Please stay with An in the meantime.
Your daughter still needs more time in therapy.
She’s terrified and unstable.
So, you should avoid seeing her at least for now.
Sweetheart.
Sweetie.
It's me. I'm Ms. Tam. Don't be afraid.
There’s no one here, no one at all.
It's me. Don't be afraid.
There’s no one here, no one at all. It's me.
Your irregular schedule affects my business heavily.
From now on, I will deliver more regularly.
Anyway, where is An?
Daddy, Ms. Tam taught me to write three pages of paper.
But why haven't you come back after ten days?
I want to play “Mandarin Square Capturing” with you.
Play with me.
-Hello, Ms. Tam. -Good morning.
-Sweetie, say hi to Ms. Tam. -Hi, Ms. Tam.
Hello, sweetheart.
You're going to make a lot of friends here.
Come and play with me.
I'll leave her with you.
-No need to worry. -Thank you!
Jeez, missing a punch like that!
Mr. Bang, have you seen my father's truck?
I don't know who your father is.
Have you seen my father's truck at the port?
You should stay outside, An is still distressed.
I… I just want to see her for a minute.
Hey An, Daddy's here.
I'll take care of this.
An, I’m here, it’s okay, don’t be scared!
Sweetheart, don't cry. I’m here, it’s okay, don’t be scared!
I’m right here.
I thought you changed the route.
Do you remember my daughter’s face?
There were thousands of people coming in and out. How could I remember?
-Have you seen the girl in this photo? -I don’t know!
Go ask somewhere else!
I haven’t seen her.
I haven’t seen her. I told you I don't know about your daughter.
What are you doing here, sweetie?
I… I'm looking for my father.
Oh… I know your father.
So…
let me help you find him.
Okay… let's go!
Go away, I don’t know your daughter.
She was here.
So I'll beat you up till you do.
Fuck off, I don't need to know your daughter.
Mr. Bang?
Mr. Bang?
Mr. Bang, please let me in.
You agreed earlier.
Leave it there.
You knew she was here.
Because you left her there.
Where did she go?
Just follow that girl.
I'll deal with your later.
Sir, please buy some bread.
I gave you the big doll last time,
this one is her younger sister.
Aren't they pretty?
They're a pair now.
Do you like them?
Mr. Thai, there's an emergency.
Go play with your dolls.
Shh, your father asked me to pick you up.
Sweetie…
Sweetie…
Where are you?…
Sweetie…
pumpkin pie, I'll give you more dolls…
Where are you hiding? Baby…
Sweetie…
Come here, my little baby!
Sweetie…
I have no parents.
I'm sorry.
I live with my blind grandma.
Hey, wake up!
Damn it!
Who the hell are you?
You lost two dolls, remember?
I'm not playing dolls.
Who are you?
I'm her father.
She's not your child.
How do you know I'm not her father?
Hey listen, I've got loads of money.
Do you want my money?
You're going to regret this.
You will stay with my fish.
Do you have any idea how powerful I am?
My family is an ant colony.
You can’t kill us all.
Then I won't kill you, I'll burn them all.
Boss!
My son… has been missing.
Your bread girl is nowhere to be found.
That scumbag also lost his daughter here, didn't he?
If my son can't be found,
then neither can you.
Find him!
Yes, sir.
Tell me the truth.
If I confess to this crime, you will kill me.
I'd die for something I didn't do.
Whether I live or die is up to you.
But I never laid a finger on your daughter.
You've got the wrong guy, you psycho.
I didn't do anything.
I said I don't know your daughter.
Let me go, I didn't do anything to your daughter.
Hey…
I need some help… hey…
Hey…
I was ignored by everyone except you.
I patched up the crack on the hydraulic hose.
Couldn't jump-start the truck, and the battery was almost dead.
Let me take a look.
Jeez another one that's sick in the head.
Hey…
Hey…
Hey… here.
I'm Bao Vi. I just changed to this route.
Here, some money for the hose.
Not for the help.
You don't have to pay me.
Hey!
Son.
Gigantic Son. I'm in here.
I have to admit that you're fast.
Dumbasses!
You've got some guts laying your hand on the boss' son.
Idiot!
Bunch of shitheads!
You've got to save me.
If I die, my father will massacre your family.
I can wait till you bleed out… and get rid of your body.
You idiot,
I'm the one who's bleeding to death, not him
Slutty Long, leave it to me.
I hear you like setting ants on fire.
If you keep scorching them, they will crawl out.
All over your face, your ears.
Take one more step and fall off the cliff…
or join me…
I'll spare you.
Come on!
Come on! Come here!
Come on!
Join me.
I like this feeling.
Come on!
Join me.
Damn it!
You're dead, and you won't be hearing this.
Your daughter enjoys playing with my dolls.
She likes them a lot.
She likes them a lot… a lot…
My son must have suffered a lot.
I will do everything you request.
Please help me.
Make him whole again!
Boss, he is an ex-task force member
who has been discharged for seven years
He was trained to crawl to you guys.
You are nothing but a pile of flesh.
Why take his kid?
Sir, they're all our items…
We thought her father was a silly one.
Also, it is for Mr. Thai's amusement.
Slutty Long, you're wrong.
Come on! Move!
An, I'm sorry!
Meow, meow… Wake up, sweetheart.
The doctor said An's condition is improving.
She still hasn't talked to anyone, though.
If anything happens… please take care of An for me.
Hung, why did you say that?
Hung!
The most important thing now is that
your daughter is still alive.
She needs you.
Please don't do anything reckless.
They must pay for what they've done.
Even if they hide under the ground, I'll dig everything up to find them.
Tell me again,
how did she get away?
Boss,
she had a fever and suffered a seizure.
I thought she was going to die.
If a part of the railway is stolen,
the train will overturn regardless of the length.
You told me everything was taken care of.
But I still see fish being sold.
You let a piece of him live.
He will find you.
I'll finish him.
Do you know what is more challenging than fighting?
Making money,
tons of money.
Money can't speak for itself.
But it holds the power that can kill that scumbag.
You guys still up for a hunt?
You ran in here…
Avoid being crushed under my wheels.
Confirmed.
I don't know who you people are.
Well! Loan-The Winner, such a joke, still a loser!
Sometimes the music reveals what the musician has been hiding.
The better the musician,
the more emotions he shows.
Your grandfather once said,
"Money is a cure."
We have every kind of "cure,"
but you only have one life.
Boss, our people have arrived.
You're my only child.
And he is still out there somewhere.
Hi, I have gifts for you all.
Ah… presents.
Here you are. Be good.
Having fun with the girls?
You really are something
Let me guess…
You're chasing us down.
And
you're coming to get her.
Like father, like daughter,
I have no idea how she could survive and find a way back to you.
You shouldn't have hung up on me. The fun is yet to come.
You'll be treated nicely this time.
And your daughter's life will depend on you.
Bastard!
An, Daddy's here, don't be afraid!
Finally, I have the chance to see you face to face.
And you… won't be seeing your daughter.
If you can get through these piles of flesh.
I will let you reunite with your daughter unconditionally.
Any last words?
Let my daughter go.
There's no such thing in the agreement.
Stop!
An…
I kept my word and allowed you to reunite.
But I'm not sure my boss wants to stop here.
You coming at us won't end well.
Finish them both!
Luu Tuan Ly, also known as Poker Face Ly
Speed up the shipments.
Why are you rushing us so hard this time?
Are you at full capacity yet?
How many can we still harvest eggs from?
We've been working nonstop.
There are still a lot to retrieve.
Take all the eggs,
the market price is at all-time high.
Others will take care of the remaining work.
Crying like that is not very nice.
Her eyes are precious.
Move!
-Stop crying! -Move! Get in!
-Stop crying! -Move!
Shut up.
-Shut up. -Hurry up!
Move!
-Move! -Sit!
The boss ordered us to speed up the shipments.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Thai has arrived safely, sir.
You and your daughter are still alive?
It was me who took your daughter. So what?
What are you going to do about it?
So what? What are you going to do about it?
You're good at diving, but you can't hide for too long.
Your daughter was shouting your name for days.
She was screaming and crying.
Get out of the water and fight me.
No matter what he did to you,
he is still my son.
You can kill me instead and let him go.
You gave him the whole world.
And I, I will take everything from you.
Please fall back, sir.
I will bring him down.
He wants me.
Open all the gates.
Useless!
You lured him into the water to beat him.
He must have choked on water.
I miss him,
he will always be my little boy.
Save me, Father!
When he was small and crying,
I stayed up all night to put him to sleep.
I like that feeling.
Now I'm hearing him cry and can't do anything.
Whoever made him cry.
I hate them the most.
If this is the last chance…
I want to ask you something.
Do you know that madmen are always the ones who break records?
I only hunt.
The fact that you had the nerve to fight back is a record in itself.
If you're not crazy enough
to accept my fortune,
that is another record.
This is where it ends.
If you shoot, your son will die.
We're not done yet, even if you get out of this alive.
I have to finish this once and for all.
I have to kill you.
My daughter is everything to me, more than my life.
I don't need any records.
You can choose to jump or stay in my truck.
You can return to your daughter.
He's guilty of multiple charges.
Justice will take its course.
Daddy!
One has many faces to show society.
This shall be your last one.
-Let me just... -[girl] I dropped the horse.
Hold on.
There. Look.
Ta-da! See?
Is it broken? No, look. Daddy fixed it. No, wait.
I'll give it to you when you tell me where we are first.
-Dad's dad's house. -That's right. This was Grandpa's house.
Here, you want the camera?
Here, take it.
No. Owie!
No, no, no, show me the playroom.
-[kitten meowing] -Wait, show your toys.
-Oh, it's okay, Caesar. -[Caesar meows]
I think Little Caesar's tired out from the drive. Aren't you, buddy?
[woman] James? Why aren't there any curtains upstairs?
Because, babe, we're in the middle of nowhere and no one's watching.
[June] Say hi, Mommy.
Hi, Junebug.
Wait a minute, I thought this was broken.
No, baby, please be careful. I just don't want it to break again.
-Daddy fixed it. -Yeah.
We just wanna make sure that we don't break it again.
Well, then I'm just gonna fix it again, aren't I?
What's that?
-James. -[James] It's just the altitude. I'm fine.
[June] Why is your nose bleeding?
-Daddy's fine. -Are you okay?
[woman 1] I just heard the news.
Uh, I can't imagine what you must be going through.
[man] We really hate to see you go, but I get it. You need a fresh start.
[woman 1] I really had no idea what you were going through. Anyway, I'm so sorry.
Anyway, I'm so sorry.
Call or text, or whatever works.
I know you are dealing with a lot right now.
[woman 2] We're gonna miss you a lot. But you two are gonna get through this.
I'm here for you. Someday she'll understand.

Well-- Oh, gosh. Can you please do me a favor and clear your voicemail?
I've been trying to leave you messages.
Well, they're probably all from you.
You know you don't have to use Siri for literally everything, right?
Listen, I am running late and I need you to write a couple of things down.
The car keys are gonna be in the top drawer in the kitchen, and Kevin--
I just said write it down. You're not writing it down.
Kevin forwarded you the itinerary.
No alcohol, do not open the door for strangers.
And keep your location service turned on
the entire time I'm away, do you understand?
No fun. Got it.
Uh, what about for like, you know, food or whatever?
[sighs] I left a key with Heather. Just call her if you need anything.
-No. Mom, I don't need Heather. -What do you mean, "No"?
I am 18. I don't need a babysitter.
I don't care if you're 18, okay?
So you pick Heather, of all people?
You do not understand the sacrifices I made to give you the life that you have.
Mom, you're being so dramatic.
-Junebug, if you'd-- -Stop calling me that!
I just need to know that you're safe when I'm away.
[sighs] All right, Kevin's gonna be there any minute to call the Uber.
I also just deposited some money into your account for emergencies.

What's the money for?

Oh, yeah. It's a little faster. Thanks.

It's a Colombian thing. I'm working on my Spanish.

How do I say this?
Look.
I know that I'm just,
I don't know, the new guy to you.
But I love your mom.
And I know I planned this for just me and her,
but it's for a very special reason.
-Kev? -So before we--
-Hey. -Hey.
What's goin' on?
June and I were just chatting.
Oh, okay. Did you call the Uber?
Two minutes away. What?
Do you wanna take the bags down?
It takes 30 seconds to wheel--
I know, but I wanna talk... Okay, all right, I'll see you out there.
Thank you.
Really?
Look, I'm sorry if it seems like I'm hard on you.
But it really is just to make sure you're safe.

Okay, coming!
June, listen to me.

-Wait, Vee, she's here! -[Veena] Who?
[June] Heather. My mom's friend.
[Veena] Shit!
[Heather] Hey, Junie. Wasn't sure you'd be home.

Oh, relax. How's it hangin'?
Oh, it's fine. Um...
How was work?
It was good. I won a custody case for a client, so that's good.
Uh, I bet your mom already misses you.
Kevin sent me a picture of them from the beach. He's been working out.
Wait, Kevin's sending you pictures?
I'm just glad she found someone. Someone nice and cute, cool tech job.
I'd kill for a guy like that. It's pretty rough out there.
Not that I don't have my fun. You know what I'm saying?
-Unfortunately. -[message chimes]
Is everything okay?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, uh, it's fine.
You know, I could stay and hang if you're bored.

Where are you guys? I've been standing here forever.

See you in a sec. Bye.
[June] Hi. I'm calling about a guest you had, seeing if they extended their stay.
I'm sorry. Uh, does anyone speak English?
[man in English] No, I'm sorry.
[June] Knew I shouldn't have dropped Spanish.
Um...
Um, it's Lin. It's spelled L-I--
[man] Oh, sí, Kevin Lin.
[June] Yeah. That's him. Uh...
¿Qué?
[June] Wait, what?
Um...
[June] What?
-[man in English] Hello? -Um...
[June] Okay. Uh...
Cameras.
[June] "En persona."
I can't go in person.
[June in English] The footage overwrites.
Uh... Cuándo?
[June] Okay. Uh...
Gracias.
[Heather] Yes, ma'am. And no one knows where they went.
I understand. Yes. Thank you.
So is the embassy doing something?
No, they're already closed.
That was a duty officer. She said to fill out a report,
and somebody would call us tomorrow when the embassy opens.
And what about the footage? Won't that be too late?
I know.
I'll make some more calls. Somebody's gotta be open 24/7.
-[sighs] -So I'll just fill out this form and--
Don't worry.
I'm gonna come by first thing tomorrow morning when the embassy opens, okay?
We're gonna figure this out.
Okay. Yeah.
Thanks, Heather.
[over speaker] Good morning. This is Assistant Legal Attaché Elijah Park.
-Am I speaking with Ms. Allen? -[footsteps approaching]
-Hello? -Hi. Hi. Hello?
Hi there. This is Elijah Park. I'm calling from the U.S. Embassy in Colombia.
I thought you guys opened an hour ago.
Sorry, I was on with Ms. Damore.
She mentioned you wanted to speak with me about some footage?
Yes. Um, the security footage, I put it all in the report.
I'll take a look. Now, I'm here in Colombia,
so I'll be acting as liaison between you and the local police.
Did you not get my report? Um... doesn't appear so.
Um... doesn't appear so.
Great. Okay, well, the hotel has security footage, but it constantly overwrites.
So we have about six hours until it's gone,
so can you please send an agent over?
I'll do my best.
But keep in mind, the FBI doesn't have jurisdiction to investigate in Colombia.
So it may take some time while we work with local authorities.
Great.
Now, listen, what's even more helpful to us
is any information you can tell me about your mom.
Did she say or do anything unusual before she went missing?
Could be a text, uh... a voicemail.
No, not really.
Okay. That's okay.
Um... and do you have access to anything we could use to geolocate?
Her Gmail, iCloud?
Wait. Maybe...
Listen, we can only use evidence from accounts that you have legal access to.
Otherwise nothing we learn will be admissible in court.
I think I might have something.
Come on.
Never mind. Sorry, I don't have anything.
That's okay.
I know you're 18, but do you have relatives that could come stay with you?
No. Um, it's just me and my mom.
Heather is probably gonna stop by.
You are going to get that footage, though, right?
If you get that form in, I'll make sure it gets to the right hands. Okay?
We'll be in touch.
Hi. Hello?
Hi. Um... [groans]
I think your sound is off.
-[speaking in Spanish] -Oh, hi. Yes, yes. Hi, Javier.
[in English] Uh... signal okay now?
The signal is great. I need you--
You are from where?
I'm from Los Angeles. I need--
Hollywood!
Van Nuys.
I need you to go to this hotel and ask for their security footage.
I'm tryna find someone.
I don't understand. "Tryna find."
She's missing.
How long?
Like 36 hours.
And I need someone to get to the hotel and get the footage before it's erased
And I need someone to get to the hotel and get the footage before it's erased so we can see when she and her boyfriend left.
La policía will not check?
No. No, I mean, they said they would try, but they can't even investigate directly.
So I need your help.
Ah, lo siento, pero...
I'm only services. Cleaning, electric, you know.
Please. Please, it's my mom.
Please.
You make me think of my son.
Never taking no for an answer.
Okay. Okay.
Oh, man, thank you so much.
Oh, June. Interesting thing.
Did you know that your phones are always tracking you?
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
But I can't get into her accounts even if I wanted to.
And did you try his?
What?
You said she's traveling with her boyfriend.
So if you can't find hers, maybe...
Right.
I can find him.
-Yo. -[June] Hey, Vee.
Thanks for coming by. Heather never showed up.
Of course. This is so crazy.
Uh, hey, I think Caesar's eating your smartwatch.
What? I don't have a smartwatch.
Anyway, does Kevin give you same-password-for-everything type of vibe?
Mm... 50-50.
Actually, 60-40. Why is your mom dating this guy?
Heather thinks he's hot.
[Veena] Of course she does.
So you're trying to get his password?
[June] Yeah.
Oh, yeah. This will work.
Do you remember that time you impersonated the Postmates driver on the phone?
[in deep voice] Dude, he had no idea.
All right. I need your help.
[man] So to recover your password, I'll just have to verify a couple things,
starting with date of birth.
November 10th, 1980.
Great. And the last four of your social.
I don't give that out on the phone.
Uh, in that case, your mother's maiden name.
Uh... Chen. Julia Chen.
And the name of your elementary school.
[Veena] Uh...
-The name of my elementary school? -Yup.
-Uh... sir? -[Veena] Do you need the full name or...?
Honestly, whatever works.
Uh, Tillman Elementary?
[June] Oh, sweet, we're in.
Okay. Let's see where they were going.
There's their Uber to LAX.
Flight to Cartagena.
Hotel.
Wait.
[Veena in normal voice] Maybe he didn't have service?
[Veena in normal voice] Maybe he didn't have service? [June] But he was texting me the whole time.
-Unless he turned off his location. -[call ringing]
Bad news. The footage is already gone.
But interesting story.
La señora que limpia, how do you say, the cleaning señora,
she went to school with my son. And we got to talking--
she went to school with my son. And we got to talking-- No, Javi, no time for stories.
Hold on.
So I explain to her what I'm looking for,
and she says she sees two American tourists leave on Friday.
Wait, so she saw them leave.
Now you have time for the story, huh?
So they're going to leave, and your mother says sorry
because she spilled some wine on the bedsheets.
This is like 1 in the afternoon.
She dressed up very nice, so the señora asked if they were going somewhere fancy.
She dressed up very nice, so the señora asked if they were going somewhere fancy. And guess what your stepfather said.
And guess what your stepfather said.
Ew, no, not my stepfather.
Oh, all right. But he says he wants to go to...
how do you say, you know, store where shovels and hammers--
Wait, a hardware store?
Sí, hardware store.
On vacation.
Did she say what store they went to?
Uh, no, she didn't ask.
There's gotta be a way to figure it out.
Yo.
Me llamo Veena.
Hola. Mucho gusto. Javi.
Credit card history.
His purchases should have a location attached to them.
Boom. Kevin's last purchase.
Same day they went missing.
Getsemani. That's the store.
No. Getsemani. That's not a store.
That's an area, muy turístico, where you go to pay too much for drinks.
Okay, well, I'm sending you all the hardware stores in Getsemani.
Talk to the workers, see if they saw anything, okay?
[Javi] Or maybe I just buy some gum.
-Huh? -To see if the bank code matches. Eh?
Oh, my God. Yes, Javi. Yes. Okay, I'm sending you the code now.
June, eight stores might take a few hours. Is that okay with you?
[June] For now.
I'll look through his emails too, see if there's a receipt in there.
Okay.
Here we go, then.
-[scooter engine revs] -[Heather] You're going through his email?
Yeah, so?
So you can't break into Kevin's email without permission.
But why would he turn off his locations? That doesn't make sense.
I don't know, but you need to let the police handle this stuff.
Um, are you coming over?
I'm sorry. I gotta go into the office. I had to change a client meeting.
But I'll be there.
-Whoa. -What? What is it?
Um, sorry, Heather, I gotta go.
No match yet. Six more to go.
[June] Wait, wait, hold up.
I-- I think Kevin was cheating.
"Sheeting"?
[Veena] He clearly has a type.
What if you checked his blocked users?
His what?
In his contacts. Remember that one Unfiction episode with the affair?
[June] Whoa.
Who are these people?
What the hell?
[Veena] Wait. Who's Greg?
Hey, what's going on?
[June] This woman calls him Darren.
They all want their money back.
[Veena] Yo. Dude's not cheating. He's a...
-He's a con man. -[ominous music playing]
[Park] Three years in Eastham Federal Prison. Released last year.
[June] So you weren't gonna tell me my mom was dating a felon?
[Park] Look, don't get me wrong. We are looking into him.
But he's never been involved in a disappearance. And he's been using his legal name.
[June] But don't you think this is a pretty big coincidence?
[Park] Keep in mind that all of these cases were from before his prison sentence.
And he's never violated parole.
[June] Okay.
But what about that Bunny Cake girl? That's from this year.
I understand, but right now you are illegally accessing Mr. Lin's account.
So any evidence that I receive from that gets tossed in court.
Look, I appreciate the help.
But our job is to find your mom and build a prosecutable case if there's a crime.
So we gotta do this the right way.
You need to trust me on this.
-[line dialing] -[man] Uh, yeah, she works here.
[June] And you haven't heard from her at all?
Nope. I've tried calling, DMing her.
I've been stuck covering her shift for the last two weeks, so...
Two weeks.
Not exactly out of character, though. She's... special.
Do you mind calling if you hear from her? It's important. Uh... sure.
Uh... sure.
Bunny Cake is missing too. She hasn't been to work in two weeks.
You think he did something to her?
I don't know.
But I know how to find out.
[Veena] I thought he turned his location off. [June] Not till they got to Colombia.
Whoa.
He was seeing her.
What were you up to?
What the hell?
[Jim on phone] And you got this number how?
I'm calling about Kevin Lin. He visited your house like two weeks ago.
Wait, slow down. Kevin?
Kevin Lin. He was at your house...
June 8th. What was he doing there?
Look, I don't wanna say anything that he doesn't want public.
Oh, so you're trying to cover for him?
Covering for wha--? Of course not.
Then why was he at your house?
It's a reentry program for ex-offenders.
I was paired with Kevin before I moved out here.
He comes and visits sometimes.
Look, the hardest part for these guys is getting past the stigma,
so I try to be careful.
[June] Yeah, totally.
And did he ever...
mention my mom anytime?
Mention?
I mean, he hasn't shut up about her since they first met.
She seemed really good for him.
Yeah. Um, do you remember how they met?
I mean, you'd know better than me.
Yeah.
Um, you don't think this was just another one of his, you know...
Oh, no. I mean, look.
Kevin's worked really hard to put that stuff behind him.
It seemed real to me.
Yeah.
Um, and you said your name was Jim?
Jimmy, yeah.
Listen, I'll talk to the wife. I'll, uh, see if she remembers anything.
Good luck, June.
Okay. Thanks, Jimmy.
[June] Is this the store?
Do you know how many packs of gum I bought today?
Did anyone see them?
No one remembers.
But I got the receipt.
Wait, you got it? What did he buy?
Just this.
A lock?
Why would he buy a lock?
And what about security cameras?
No. [speaks in Spanish]
So, what's next?
Hey. I gotta bounce. I'll see you tomorrow, though.
Oh. Okay. Yeah, sounds good.
Uh, hasta luego, Javi.
Adiós, Veena.
I hope I didn't waste your money.
No. No, Javi.
You've been really helpful.
Maybe you should tell la policía about the lock.
They maybe know something.
Sure thing.
Peace, Javi.
Piece of what?
-No, like peace. -Ah.
Just means goodbye.
Text if you need anything.
Hey, Grace!
Sorry, I didn't mean to say it that loud. Um...
Uh, Kevin here.
And I thought I'd just try to get things started.
What's your favorite '80s band?
I know, a third message is lame.
But you seem great, and I'd love to know more about you.
Also, hello.
I forgot that. Okay.
I certainly admire your persistence. So, what would you like to know?
Believe it or not, back in the day, I used to be a huge fan of...
New Edition.
[laughs] Okay.
You totally stole my answer.
I'm kind of a social media guy cliché.
Shared office space.
There's beer on tap.
I don't drink anymore, though, really. Guess I'm gettin' old.
[Grace] Hi.
I'm just getting home.
Another 13-hour day.
You know what, Grace? It sounds like you need a vacation.
Just get off the grid, do a hard reset.
That's what works for me.
Hey, Siri, can we take a vac--? Oh, crap.
"Hey, Siri, can we take a vaca--?"
Hey, Siri, remind me to ask Grace out to dinner. Uh...
Wait...
Is this recording?
Guess what this song is called.
Last night was fun.
I just don't know what to do.
I tried to leave a voicemail. Her voicemail is full.
She turned off location services.
And she knows that she's supposed to be home at 11.
She knows this.
[Kevin] Hey.
She's almost 18.
If she took the time to turn off locations,
she's probably okay.
[Grace] I know, I just...
I don't know. She--
When I look at her, I just...
I just see her father, and it's like...
We've really been through a lot together.
And I just don't think that I could, uh...
I don't think that I could forgive myself if anything ever happened to her, you know?
You seem like a really great mom.
One day,
she'll get that.
[Kevin] Uh... so actually, I've got stuff too.
I have a record.
And I shoulda told you earlier.
But I just really...
I really like you, and I just didn't wanna screw this up.
But if you don't wanna, uh, keep talking,
I totally get it.
So...
So yeah.
[Javi] "G-A, K-L."
¿Sí?
Yeah.
[Javi] There it is.
There it is.
I should have thought of this place.
Lots of tourists. And good for couples.
Hold on a sec.
There.
Javi, can you wave for me?
¿Qué?
Wave.
I see you. [laughs]
Hey, June! [laughs]
Okay, let me check the archive.
Come on, come on, come on.
Wait.
There!
[Javi] Do you see them?
Yeah.
He has the lock.
Wait.
Wait, he's pulling something out of his pocket.
What?
It was real.
Is everything all right?
Um, yeah. Let me call you back.
[Park] Ms. Allen? We may have found them.
[June] I know they were at the bridge. You were right. He wasn't trying to con her.
-Ms. Allen. -Yeah?
Listen.
We've got some bad news.
[June] Oh, my God.
[June] Who are these people?
[Park] We don't know.
We just received this this morning from an anonymous source.
We're mobilizing units across the city as we speak.
What are they gonna do to her?
Well, we flagged a withdrawal from your mom's bank to an encrypted third-party account,
so they may just want money.
[June] So, what now? Is there anything I can do?
Hey, we're gonna find these guys, okay?
The best thing you can do to help us is just wait by your phone.
We'll be in touch.
They said something about money, but what if these people hurt her?
They have no reason to.
I've already lost one parent, Javi. I can't lose her too.
I didn't even say goodbye.
When did you lose your father?
I'm sorry if you don't wanna talk about it.
No, it's fine. Um...
It was years ago.
I can't even remember the funeral.
My son Carlos lost his mom when he was very young too.
That's why I ask.
I know it's hard.
Yeah.
Your son is lucky he still has you, Javi.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
He was always trouble.
But the trouble got worse, then one day we had this big fight and...
He said he never wanted to talk to me again.
I guess he meant it.
But, you know, even if he doesn't want to see me,
he's always mi Carlito.
And whatever you are beating yourself over with your mom...
it doesn't change a parent's love.
I know.
Have you tried reaching out?
To your son?
He knows where I am.
Well, anyway, um...
I don't wanna take any more of your time, Javi.
-Thank you. -It's no problem, June.
Call anytime.
And, listen, they're gonna find her.
I know.
Peace, amiga. Hm?
[softly] Peace.
Oh, my God.
Good morning.
I'm Elijah Park with the FBI.
Last evening we determined that U.S. citizen Grace Allen,
previously thought to have been kidnapped here in Cartagena, Colombia,
was in fact impersonated in an alleged scheme by the suspects behind me.
We are now turning to the public for any information
regarding the whereabouts of Miss Allen, who we now believe...
never left Los Angeles. -[reporters clamoring] -[cameras clicking]
Hi, everybody, first up this morning: "The strangest case I've ever seen."
Those are the words used by LAPD Detective Luciana Gomez
to describe the disappearance of a Van Nuys resident
who was seemingly swapped out with another woman along their Uber drive to LAX.
[Gomez] Because of the staged kidnapping, we've lost a lot of time.
It's now been over a week since Miss Allen was last seen, so we need to move quickly.
[woman] A ground search begins today for a woman police say went missing
somewhere along her nearly 22-mile trip to the airport.
-[man] Grace! -[people yelling]
Grace!
They were talking to you for a while. They know anything?
They think whatever happened must have been on the drive to LAX.
Right, right, right. Look at this. Look at 'em.
So your mom gets in the Uber, they take the 405,
and then a totally different woman gets out at LAX.
If Kevin did something to her, that's when it happened.
The weird thing is, he only ever stopped for three minutes along the way.
He must have had help.
[Gomez] Uber has no record of the trip, and the car was using stolen plates.
-We got an APB out for the vehicle now. -[reporters clamoring]
Yep. Down in front.
[man] Is it possible that the Uber driver was hired?
It's possible.
According to our friends at the FBI...
Large withdrawals from Miss Allen's bank account were made after her disappearance.
In the meantime, the one person who knows for sure what's going on here...
Is Mr. Lin.
So we're working with the police around the region, including officers at the Venezuelan border.
including officers at the Venezuelan border.
We find him...
-And we find Grace Allen. -[reporters clamoring]
[June] Whoa. Javi, what are they saying?
They say that the police arrested some local students
that Lin hired to be part of a movie.
-Whoa. June, check this out. -Huh?
[woman 1] They're arresting her. Right now.
There she is. There, there.
[woman 2] No, no, no. Can you see her?
What?
Aspiring actress Rachel Page, recently detained upon reentering the U.S.,
was released today on bail as a cooperating witness.
[Rachel] He said it was a reality show.
Like a lifestyle travel thing,
all shot on a iPhone and stuff.
I had to walk a certain way, dress a certain way.
And I couldn't even post anything on Instagram.
But after the kidnapping scene,
I knew something was up.
So I made a run for it.
But there was no crew, no real cameras.
None of that seemed odd?
I just thought:
"Damn. This guy has a vision."
-[chimes] -[June] How do you know she's not lying?
Miss Page said Kevin and his driver picked her up near the 405,
so LAPD checked traffic cameras.
By the time Kevin got there, your mom was already gone.
Miss Page never saw her.
[June] Okay, well, did she get a good look at the driver?
[Park] Middle-aged, baseball hat, that's all we got.
She couldn't see his face from the back seat.
Yo, Kevin for sure hired that guy.
Veena, shut up.
I'm sorry.
[Park] Listen, Miss Allen, while I have you,
I have some questions regarding something we're looking into.
Okay.
You mentioned that you don't have any extended family, right?
No.
[Park] To the best of your knowledge, your mom has never gone by any other names?
No. She's just Grace Allen. Why?
Exclusive developments tonight in the case of Grace Allen:
Public records suggesting there may be more to the missing Van Nuys resident
than meets the eye.
Turns out Grace Allen is just one of the mystery woman's aliases,
whose real identity lies locked behind a court-ordered seal.
You're her lawyer. There's nothing you can do?
It's a court-ordered seal.
It's gonna take at least a week to get a judge to lift it.
And she never said anything to you about this?
I don't...
No, I don't think so.
Why would she keep this from me?
[woman] Does this suggest Grace Allen herself might be implicated?
Let me be clear:
Right now, Grace Allen is not a suspect.
That being said,
we can't rule anything out.
[woman 1] Hi, is this June Allen? I'm an executive at Netflix, and we'd love to talk to you.
[man] ...calling in for my podcast on Spotify--
[woman 2] I tried leaving a voicemail. I'm writing an article--
[Angel] Yo, it's Angel. Just checking in on things with your mom.
Also, did you find my watch?
Also, did you find my watch? [woman 3] So the missing money wasn't stolen.
It was payment to Kevin for helping her disappear. Why else would she--
She hired Lin and the driver, stages the kidnapping,
hides in the trunk, drives off, starts a new life somewhere.
Which we know she's done once before.
I mean, zero known family members, other than the daughter?
That's hella sus.
[June] I cannot take this anymore!
It's just the Internet, June.
No, no, it's not just the Internet. It's the police too.
Hey, hey, hey. It's going to be okay, June.
Don't let them put you down.
How many tax dollars have been wasted searching for someone who clearly ran away?
I mean, her coworker described her as dodgy and guarded about her past.
[June] How can people believe any of this? They're focusing on the wrong person.
[Veena] At least they're trying to help.
Like, imagine if this was an Unfiction episode.
You'd be asking questions too, no?
About Kevin. Not my mom.
Yeah, but even you said she was hiding something, right?
She knew about Kevin the whole time. Plus the whole identity change--
Veena, what the hell?
No, I just mean that there are some legit questions.
There are no questions!
This is not a show, this is my mom!
June, obviously I--
You should just go.
She was messaging Kevin less than 24 hours ago.
Plus she's been ignoring me since they went missing.
Breathe. Just breathe. Maybe there is a good answer.
And she's been obsessed with Kevin ever since they met. It's all making sense.
-What is that? -It has a camera.
This way, she won't know I'm recording.
June, if you think something is wrong, you need to tell la policía.
I have tried! I have tried telling them about Kevin and about Rachel.
But anything I find on Kevin's account can't be used
to help "build a prosecutable case" or whatever,
so I have to record her.
I'm syncing to the watch now.
I need you to stay on the phone while I'm in there in case something happens.
[Javi] June, I'm sorry.
It's too dangerous.
No, the police are acting like my mom's some kind of criminal mastermind.
Pero maybe right now you need to trust them.
What are you saying?
Just because someone is your parent,
it doesn't mean they do not make mistakes.
I guess you would know, huh?
Maybe you gave up on your son...
but I'm not giving up on my mom.
-[ominous music playing] -[reporters chattering]
It's June 27th, 10 p.m.,
at the office of Heather Damore, 73815 Wilshire Boulevard.
Approaching her office now.
-[knocking on door] -Heather?
Heather, it's June!
Heather, I saw your car out there. I know you're-- [gasps]
Hello?
The hell?
What?
Hello?
Heather?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Heather!
[Park] Based on the autopsy, whoever did this was there minutes before you arrived.
You're lucky to be alive.
They must've seen the messages I sent to her.
They knew I was coming.
I just don't understand why she'd be messaging him.
Look, the wiped computer, the missing files...
My guess is that she knew something that Kevin didn't want us to know.
She wasn't willfully messaging him.
He was threatening her.
And the photos were...?
To keep her quiet. Yeah.
She was trying to protect me.
But if Kevin is still in Colombia, who did this?
I don't know.
But in the meantime, LAPD will stay there with you
until they find a safe place for you to go. Okay?
Look, Mr. Lin is the key to all of this.
Now, the good news is police may have spotted him near the border,
so it might not be long.
He is our best chance at finding your mom.
Yeah.
Thank you.
[man] ¡Policía!
[Kevin] Okay! Hey! Hold up!
Tranquilo.
No comprendo.
Please!
[Grace] Hey, sweetheart. It's Mom.
Just, um, wondering if you wanted to catch a movie toni--
Hi, my name is Grace Allen,
and I'm actually your mother, if you could call me back at your earliest convenience.
Hey, Siri. Call Junie--
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. I thought this was a--
Never mind.
Hey, Junebug.
It's Mommy.
I tried knocking, uh, but you didn't answer.
I'm sure you have your headphones on.
Look, there's actually a lot I want to talk with you about.
So anyway, you're probably not even checking these messages,
but I guess we'll talk later.
I love you.
Bye--
Hey, Junebug. It's--
[June] Hello?
Hello?
-Hello? -[Jimmy] June?
Thank God. Are you safe?
Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Why?
Are all the doors locked?
Yeah, I think so.
Wait, this is Jimmy from the church thing?
Look, there's a lot to explain, but we don't know who's listening.
Okay. Well, should I call someone?
No, I don't know who to trust at this point.
Look, just stay on the phone with me, okay? -[keys jingling] -[car door closes]
[gasps] Oh, my God. Someone's here.
It's just me.
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay.
What?
What are you doing here?
I came as soon as I could. I didn't mean to scare you.
No, you need to tell me what's going on right now before I call the police!
Listen.
I know this sounds crazy.
I came as soon as I could.
I'm sorry to show up like this...
but there are things...
There are things that you need to know.
I can explain everything.
June?
Are you still there?
June.
June?
If you can hear me...
Look, I know this is hard.
But you deserve to know what happened.
Please.
June?
Dad.
June.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Okay, okay.
Wait.
Okay.
What is going on?
Your mom...
Her real name is Sarah.
And when you were little,
we were always fighting.
She barely would let me feed you...
or play with you.
Every day it got worse and worse.
Until she took you away.
And I've been searching for you ever since.
Hey.
Caesar.
She told me you were dead.
June, you don't know what she's capable of.
She lied to a judge to have me put in prison
so that she could have you to herself.
She lied to me.
Every day for 12 years...
I had to wake up in Eastham knowing that she had you somewhere.
You were in Eastham Prison?
In Texas?
June.
She took everything from me.
But that's where Kevin was.
You weren't his counselor.
You met him in prison.
Sweetheart.
Please.
June.
Can we just talk for a minute?
Where is she?
Sweetheart.
-Hey, no! June! -Help!
No, no, no!
It's okay.
[James] Well, then I'm just gonna fix it again, aren't I?
What's that?
-[Grace] James. -It's just the altitude. I'm fine.
James, are you okay?
No, no, no, no. Daddy's fine.
James.
-Are you good? -[James clears throat]
-Hey, do you wanna play hide-and-seek? -Mm-hm.
You wanna go upstairs? I'll count to 20.
And don't let Daddy find you. Okay?
-Why you gotta do that in front of her? -Do what?
"Are you good?"
What, I can't play with my own daughter now?
-I didn't say anything. -Seriously?
It's just that I saw you go out back and I know--
Are you filming this?
-No, I'm not filming anything. -Give me the camera.
[James] Sarah, I've been trying to call. Where are you?
[Grace] Are you at the house?
Yeah.
Look, how about you and June come back, and we talk this out.
Okay?
[Grace] You promised me you would stay clean.
[James] And what, you're saying I haven't?
You can't just make shit up in order to steal my daughter from me, Sarah.
Look, Sare-bear, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get upset.
It's just--
It is frustrating trying to reason with you when you won't acknowledge baseline facts.
when you won't acknowledge baseline facts.
Look, I promise I'm clean.
Can you just come home, so that we can work this out as a family?
For June's sake?
[Grace] Then how do you explain what I found in the hallway closet?
[James] What?
What are you talking about?
[Grace] We were playing hide-and-seek.
And guess what June found.
[James] Okay, Sarah. Yes, I found a way to turn some stuff over, but it's worth a lot,
Yes, I found a way to turn some stuff over, but it's worth a lot,
so you need to cut the shit and tell me what you did with it!
[Grace] I left it where it was.
-[sirens wailing] -[officer] Police! Open the door!
[James] Jesus Christ, what did you do?
[Grace] I can't let you put our daughter in danger anymore.
[officer] You need to open the door!
[James] I swear to God, I will find you,
and you will die in a pool of your own blood before you take her from me!
Do you hear me?!
[woman 1] I can't imagine what you must be going through.
[man] We really hate to see you go.
[woman 2] I really had no idea what you were going through.
[woman 2] I really had no idea what you were going through. [woman 1] I love you. I'm praying for you and June.
[woman 1] I love you. I'm praying for you and June. [woman 2] I know you two will get through this together.
-[woman 1] We're gonna miss you a lot. -[Grace] Someday she'll understand.
No!
No! No!
Just gotta take care of one thing, and then we'll leave.
[Grace] Shit.
[James] We're going outside.
If you were gonna kill me, you woulda done it already.
[James] Things have changed.
June.
-[screams] June! -[James grunting]
-[whimpers] -Twelve years, Sarah.
Twelve years, I felt just like you feel right now.
I wish I could've kept you here. But...
-June and I have to go. -[grunts]
June!
Oh, my God. Junie!
-Mom! Mom? Mom? -Okay, baby. You're okay.
-Is that really you? -Baby, I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
We have to get out of here, do you understand me? He is spiraling.
-He killed Heather. -He killed Heather?
He's crazy. He thinks he's punishing me for what I did to him.
Okay. I'm gonna tell you everything in the car.
I want you to take the keys--
No, Mom!
No! No! No, no, no!
Oh, my God!
Oh, God.
Where is he going?
[Grace] The chair.
-What is he gonna do to us? -I don't know.
I don't even know why he brought you here.
Oh, 'cause he knew.
He knew I was about to find him.
Wait.
Hello? Hello, hello? Can anyone hear me?
Okay, June, we have to get out of here while he's still outside.
Where's your phone?
I don't have my phone. It's at the house. If only I could just...
Oh, my God.
What?
Oh, my God, yes!
Do you remember the address to this place?
[Grace] I think it was something Mariposa Road?
But that's all I remember.
[June] Everything needs to be paired with a phone.
-Wait. -[Grace] What?
[June] Unless...
Okay. I have an idea.
I need to use the navigation. Please do not call again. Okay? Bye.
Javi, please! I'm sorry about what I said.
You did not give up on your son.
I found my mom, but we're running out of time.
Please, I need your help.
Please.
What?
I need you to go to my Instagram and find a picture.
I still don't see him.
[June] Please hurry.
[Javi] Sí, sí, momentico.
[groans] What's the account name?
[June] It's J-U-underscore-U--
[Javi] "Underscore"? ¿Qué es eso? What's that?
[June] It's the little line, like at the bottom, you know?
-[Javi speaks in Spanish] -[June] Yeah.
So it's J-U-underscore-U-N-E-1.
[June] Okay, I need you to go to the first picture on my Instagram.
[June] Great. On the house behind us, there are numbers. What are they?
[Javi] Um... 48541.
[June] Okay, call the police and tell them we are at 4--
Oh, no.
He's coming back.
Get back.
What's going on?
-Give me the watch. -What--
Hey!
I am talking to my daughter.
June, did you just make a call?
Okay. Now, I need you to come with me right now.
Back off.
-June, come with me, please. -Leave her alone.
One more word from you, and you are dead.
June, I'm not gonna ask again.
Please don't--
Mom!
No, no, no!
Mom!
What did you do?! No!
What did you do?
June--
Come on. Hey!
Get off of me!
See? It's okay.
-You're just making this harder. -[screaming]
[Grace] Please.
[June] No, no, no!
Hey! Hey, let us out! Let us out!
Mom!
Mom. Mom.
No.
Dad. Dad, please. Please don't do this.
Please, if you can hear me, just open the door, please!
She needs help! Please!
No one has to die. Just please call for help!
Anyone!
If anyone can hear me, I am trapped in a room with my mom!
We are at 48541 Mariposa Road.
Anyone.
[Grace] Junebug?
Mom.
No. Mom, it's okay.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
No, no, no.
No, you don't say that. No. No, you don't say that.
[sobs] I'm sorry.
I promise...
I promise if we could just get home, I'll be better.
I'll start checking my voicemails.
I'll let you call me Junebug all you want.
And I'll stop making fun of you for using Siri for literally everything.
I just...
Hey, Siri.
Call 911.
[woman over radio] Distress call at 48541 Mariposa Road.

-SWAT! Let me see your hands! -Hands up!
[woman] Victim down, victim down!
[man] Clear!
Lung's collapsed. We need a transport now.
[June] Is she okay?
30-Squad to Control, we have an adult female, upper body GSW, requesting airlift.
Hey, Junebug, it's Mom. I hope I'm not interrupting--
-Mom? -Yeah?
This is FaceTime.
Oh, gosh.
I know, I know. -I just put the phone down for a second. -Mm-hm.
I just wanted to remind you that your bus leaves at 8:35 in the morning,
so you might wanna set multiple alarms.
Yep. Already did.
I'll also send you some lunch money if you need any, okay?
What?
Nothing.
Just thank you.
Oh, guess what.
Your friend Javi friended me on Facebook.
For real? No way.
Okay. Well, I guess I'll see you at Union Station tomorrow afternoon.
Can't wait.
