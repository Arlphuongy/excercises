It's me, Chrissy.
-Is the tub full of water? -Yep.
-Got the bubbles? -Yep.
-Extra towels? -Extra extra.
Let’s do it.
Chrissy! It’s time for your…
-Huh? -Chrissy?
No bath time!
Can’t catch me!
Come back, you little hubcap! It’s…
All right, little lady. You have nowhere to go!
Let’s all just go home and take a nice, warm bath.
No!
Ready for that bath? No, thank you.
Go!
Stay on her tail. I'll cut her off at the pass!
-Why aren’t you in school? -Why aren’t you at work?
Touché.
Come back here!
I’m gonna get you!
No!
I got ya!
I don’t got ya.
-You fall for that every time. -Just catch that toddler.
Get back here, Chrissy!
Another peaceful day in Bumperton Hills.
Chrissy!
Hey, slow down!
Hey! Slow down.
Hey, get back here!
Hi, Wilder!
Hi, Chrissy!
Bath time?
Bath time.
Good luck! You too. Call me later!
She’s getting away, Mrs. C.
Not helpful, Halle.
Can't catch me!
Yeah!
Get her, honey!
Got you!
Tub’s almost full.
All right, Chrissy. You ready?
No.
-Come on. It’s your turn to take a bath. -Then me next!
What? I love baths.
You could teach Chrissy to love baths. What do you think, Chrissy?
She's good.
-Chrissy! -Chrissy!
Amazing!
-Amazing? -Look!
A box?
No! Pretend.
See?
Box… with drawing?
Box? No!
House. Come inside.
It’s dark. Can’t see.
Hold on.
Better?
Come over here.
What's this?
TV! Use the remote.
What?
Pretend!
Time to go downstairs.
Now, Chrissy with the weather. Up next, tornado!
I am a robot.
There are people! Stairs! Tornado!
Now what?
It’s just a hole. Not a hole. Mirror!
-Boo! -Boo!
What now?
What?
What is it?
Volcano!
Hot!
Pretend.
We’re trapped.
Way out! Let’s jump. Ready?
Broken.
I know!
Pirate ship! Ahoy, matey.
Arr, matey!
We sail!
Choppy water.
What's next?
No more marker!
No…
All done.
I know! Close your eyes and pretend really hard.
Look!
Yay! Pretend!
-Let's go! -Hold on.
-Yay! -Yay!
Yay!
Hi, Carley! Hey, Chrissy. You look so cute bouncing on that trampoline.
Hey, Chrissy. You look so cute bouncing on that trampoline. Really?
Of course. Chrissy, you are just the cutest thing ever!
I’ll see you later.
I’m so cute!
Hey, Bobby.
What you doing? Blowing dandelions? Making wishes?
-You are just the cutest thing ever! -What?
Thank you.
Keep trying, little guy. You can do it. Oh, hello.
So cute!
Oh, did someone fall down? Looks like someone needs some holding.
Woof!
You’re a little puppy!
Meow.
So cute.
Woof!
Meow. Cute!
Carley!
Yes, cutie?
Oh, gesundheit.
Excuse you.
Gesundheit.
Gesundheit. I mean, excuse you!

You’re giving me candy?
You’re giving me money?
Thank… you?
So cute!
Oh, I love it!
Yeah!
Oh, I don’t know that song.
Cute.
Oh, is that Beethoven?
This is all so very cute.
-What is it, Bobby? -I love…
What do you love, Bobby?
Don’t you dare.
I love you, Carley.
That is the cutest thing ever!
What is it?
Well, my dad was gonna throw it out, but I saved it,
because it reminded me of you.
Timeless. Oh, Brett!
You are the cutest!
Thanks, Carley. Wanna go help me add it to my gallery space?
Okay.
-Teenagers. -Teenagers.
Snacky snack!
Here you go, Chrissy. I got you a special treat. Yay!
Raisins!
Raisins?
Yuck.
Raisins are good for you, and make Mummy feel better
Raisins are good for you, and make Mummy feel better about that milkshake I gave you yesterday.
Cookie!
Yay!
Come back, cookie!
-Bye, Daddy. -Bye!
Hi, Daddy.
-Hi! -Oh, hello there, Chrissy.
-Hi! -Oh, hello there, Chrissy. Chasing a cookie in a jar, I see.
I remember the first time I chased a sugary snack.
Fastest crumb cake I ever… Don’t mean to be rude, but I’m going left. Bye!
-Bye, Mr. Coaltrain! -Hope you catch your cookie!
Come back!
Hey, wait up.
Wait for me!
Got ya.
Hey, kids. Who wants a healthy snack?
-Cookie! -Cookies!
What? Cookies?
No. I brought oranges.
-Cookie! -Cookies!
I…
I don’t have any cookies!
Please don’t eat me! I’m not as sweet as I look!
Oh no!
Oh no!
You ate all your raisins! Good job, Chrissy.
I think you deserve a cookie.
Cookie!
Here you go.
The last oatmeal raisin cookie. Raisins?
What?
Baby Unicar! Colours so bright!
Travels the universe…
Baby Unicar! Colours so bright! Travels the uni--
Chrissy! Now, you know we don’t draw on the wall…
Is that me?
Wait. No. No drawing on the wall.
Put the chalk down.
That is not what I meant! Chrissy, I'm warning you.
That's it! Time out!
No!
Chrissy, stay on the couch until time out is over.
I set this timer for five minutes. Stay there until the face goes from sad to happy. I’ll be in the other room.
Stay there until the face goes from sad to happy. I’ll be in the other room.
Baby Unicar! Colours so bright!
Whatever.
Travels the universe Making wrongs right
No.
Yay, ball!
-Stay on the couch until time out is over. -But, Daddy--
No more talking, please.
Yeah!
Baby Unicar! Colours so bright!
Yes! Baby Unicar!
Travels the universe Making--
-Oh no! -No TV during time outs.
Well, at least it comes off easy.
My boot's not that big.
All done!
Baby Unicar! Colours so…
Daddy?
I was just fixing it. -No, Chrissy, I was just-- -That’s it! Time out!
-No, Chrissy, I was just-- -That’s it! Time out! No!
Fair is fair. Okay, Daddy. Don’t leave sofa until sad to happy.
Okay, Daddy. Don’t leave sofa until sad to happy.
Chrissy, you set it for an hour.
No more talking, please. Bye-bye.
Oh boy.
-Where to next, everybody? -Last one to the ball pit’s a rusty car!
Chrissy want!
Bobby Mini Van.
Chrissy Carson.
Are you two eyeing that big Baby Unicar toy? One hundred tickets is a lot, but totally worth it. It’s our last one.
One hundred tickets is a lot, but totally worth it. It’s our last one.
It’s on!
Three, two, one, go!
Oh yeah.
Oh no!
Banana peel.
Energy boost!
Yay, boost!
You got fourth place!
Yay, tickets!
Only one ticket?
New high score!

Banana peel!
-Enjoy your banana, Chrissy! -Oh no!
-Hey! -Energy boost!
Finished!
Hey, you two. What prizes can I get you today?
Baby Unicar!
Okay. I'm gonna go count these up.
-Yeah! -Yeah!
Okay, here come your prizes.
-What? -What? -Pencils? -Pencils?
Sorry, guys. You only have 50 tickets each. Pencils are all you can get.
Maybe if you put your tickets together, you could share the Baby Unicar toy?
-Share? -Share?
Found you!
Found you!
Found you! How'd you do that?
-Chrissy best hide-and-seeker. -She's pretty good.
We’ll see who’s the best. Now it’s my turn to seek. I’m gonna find you all in no time.
Not Chrissy!
Chrissy, if I can’t find you, you can have cookies for dinner.
-Cookies! -Papa!
I mean…
-One, two… -Quick!
-Three, four, five… -Let's hide in here!
Oh, I know!
…eight, nine, ten.
Ready or not, here I come!
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Found you!
I thought you’d never find me here.
-Let’s find the others. -Okay.
-If we split up, we can cover more ground. -Good idea.
Daddy! Did you find anything?
Nothing so far.
Any luck?
-Nothing downstairs. -Let’s keep looking.
-Chrissy! -What was that?
-It came from the closet! -Oh no, they’re coming!
Found you.
Looks like they found us, Chrissy.
Chrissy? She was just here.
Looks like Chrissy’s better than you thought.
What? She just got lucky! We’ll find her.
Chrissy?
Chrissy?
Chrissy?
-Chrissy! -Chrissy!
-What? -Freddie, why are you in my house?
I’m playing hide-and-seek with Kimmy and Timmy. They’ll never find me here.
Well, good luck!
Chrissy!
-Chrissy! -Chrissy!
She's not here! She’s nowhere!
-What do we do? -I don’t know where to look.
-What? -Was that her?
How is she doing this?
Just give up, Papa!
Okay, you win! Chrissy, you’re the best at hide-and-seek!
Chrissy best!
Cookie, please.
Chrissy scares me sometimes.
-Yeah. -Me too.
Yay!
Cannonball!
Chrissy?
Boo!
Splashy!
Cannonball!
Keep jumping like that and there won’t be any water left!
Time to head home, Chrissy. Say goodbye to Catalina.
One more!
Okay, just one more. I'm going to say goodbye to Cat's mum.
Okay.
-Cannonball! -Cannonball!
Cannonball!
No wheel? No cannonball.
No cannonball?
Need…
wheels!
-Those kids love being in the water. -They certainly do.
Cannonball!
Cannonball!
Too slow.
Chrissy?
I…
Hello!
Oh, hello there, little boat. Wait, a boat?
She went that way!
What?
Hi.
Chrissy!
-Nice circle! -How are we gonna make this triangle?
-Perfect! -Perfect!
-Can't stop. -Oh no!
What the…
A boat?! But… My boat!
Oh no! My masterpiece!
Wait! No!
Hi, Cory.
No!
Cannonball!
Can we please have bannock for dinner?
Maybe when boats fly.
Hello.
-Cannonball! -Cannonball!
-All right, see you next week. -See you then.
Chrissy?
-Cannonball! -Cannonball!
Sweet dreams, Chrissy.
Oh, it's me!
Hi! I'm Honkin' Henry!
Chrissy, is that you?
What was that?
Oh well.
Float?
No float.
Now it just needs a really funny joke. Let's see what's on the internet.
-Procrastination is the key -Popcorn!
A great idea will come to me
Someone commented on my new profile pic!
Out of popcorn already?
I should take a power nap before lunch.
"You’re late again, Chrissy?"
Get off my bumper, Bobby. Are we doing it or not?
We need extra concrete to support the new structure. Hold on, Julia, I need to take this call.
Hi, hun, it’s me Papa. Have you seen my snuggle socks?
Top drawer. Wait, are you about to take a nap?
I’m back. Let’s open the blueprints and take a look at the foundation.
-Hi, Chrissy. -Hi, Wilder.
Chrissy.
Bobby Mini Van.
One and a two and a three, four, five.
Yeah!
Nap time is over! Time to roll!
Bye, Wilder! Bye, Chrissy.
Chrissy.
Bobby Mini Van.
Okay.
Hi, sleepyhead.
-Did you have a good nap? -Yep!
Come sit with Mummy.
You’re getting so big. Don’t you grow up too fast, okay?
-Wait. Did you just wink at yourself? -Yep.
Almost finished. I just need to draw a perfectly straight line.
Yes. Almost there.
Yes.
Oh, Chrissy. You scared me.
Do you have a case of the hiccups? I have just the thing. Drink some water.
I know. Let’s try this.
-Now take a drink of water. -What’s going on?
I’m just helping Chrissy cure her hiccups.
I have an idea.
My mum always gave me a spoonful of sugar to cure my hiccups.
-Sugar! -I don’t know if that’ll work.
Daddy, let’s try.
-I guess-- -Sugar!
Maybe it wasn't sugar. Salt? Maybe mustard?
Maybe it wasn't sugar. Salt? Maybe mustard? Not vinegar. Pickle juice didn't work.
-Let’s try ground pepper. -Oh no. Did the fridge break again?
No, we’re just trying to get rid of Chrissy’s hiccups.
My mum has a neat trick for that. Hold your breath for ten seconds.
That was a neat trick.
Oh, Chrissy! Do you have the hiccups?
A good laugh always gets rid of them for me.
What do you call a sick train? A-choo-choo train!
The best way to get rid of hiccups is by scaring them away.
Boo!
Did it work?
When I get the hiccups, I fly corkscrews through the air. That always helps.
We have an idea!
Spin 'em out!
They're gone!
Heat helps me.
Cold gets rid of mine.
Swinging gets rid of 'em.
Still nothing?
You just have to bounce them out.
Have you tried singing?
-My mum gave me a spoonful of sugar-- -Yes, we tried that.
This mask will definitely scare those hiccups out of Chrissy.
Now, where is she?
Hiccups gone!
They're gone?
I knew laughter would do the trick.
Look at me!
Don’t look at me.
Come and get your hot chocolate here! What a nice day to go sledge… Oh, hot chocolate. Yummy!
What a nice day to go sledge… Oh, hot chocolate. Yummy! Daddy!
-Sorry! -Sledging!
-Slow down, Chrissy. Wait for me. -Let’s go!
-Slow down, Chrissy. Wait for me. -Let’s go! Okay!
Yikes!
People say the best part of sledging is actually the view.
Why don't we stay up here and get some hot chocolate?
They’ve got marshmallows! Yummy.
Thank you.
Wait! Chrissy!
Yeah!
Oh no!
Yeah!
Chrissy!
Chrissy! Wait. No!
No! Santa?
I think that’s my dad.
Your dad is Santa?
Pretty!
You know what? The best part of sledging really is the view.
My hot chocolate!
Finally. Open for business.
Hot chocolate!
Play time! Sorry, Chrissy, I can’t. I have a lot of work to do.
Sorry, Chrissy, I can’t. I have a lot of work to do. Oh, maybe you can go play with Mama and Cory?
You get to draw two cards.
-Play time! -Chrissy! -We’re actually in the middle of a game. -Yeah, ages five and up.
-We’re actually in the middle of a game. -Yeah, ages five and up.
-Maybe you can play with Daddy? -Daddy no play time.
-Use this! -Remote?
It’s a super remote! It lets you control someone like you control the TV. Watch. Hey, Cory!
Hey, is that super remote?
-We haven’t played that-- -Pause!
It’s just pretend.
But the rule is that you have to play along no matter what. Play!
Years.
I remember the fun we used to… Hey! Who put this banana in my card pile?
Have fun.
Nice job distracting her. You never do stuff like that to me, do you?
-Who wants nachos? -Me!
-Play time! -Chrissy, I said I-
-Super remote. -What! Who told you about--
Pause!
-Play. -Super remote?
-Play. -Super remote? Just don’t use it on me, okay?
Where did my pencil go?
Very funny, but I need to work. This comic is gonna take forever to finish.
Fast forward.
Done. Bye, Mr. Pencil! I’m hungry. Time for a snack!
Wait! Play time!
Hi, whatcha doing? Making nachos? None for me. Ketchup. Corn. Pan. No.
-Nothing like a cold glass of juice! -Pause.
-Play. -Oh, it’s spilled everywhere!
-You look like you’re having fun. -Mummy, play time!
-You look like you’re having fun. -Mummy, play time! I've got to get back to my game.
Rewind.
Looking for this?
Hey!
Pause!
Looks like I’m in control now.
-Play. Pause. Play. Pause. -Mummy, what are you doing? We’re still playing! Daddy, do something!
We’re still playing! Daddy, do something!
Hey!
Come on, Chrissy. You’ve had your fun.
-Hand over the remote. -Volume down.
-Get her! -Pause!
Play.
Rewind.
Play.
Time to get back to work.
-Well, I guess no more super remote. -And no more play time.
Look, everyone! It's the saltshaker of madness!
If you get hit by the magic salt, you turn into a monster!
Play time!
I’m going to eat you!
Time for tea, friends.
Cheers.
Stinky.
Nope.
No.
Stay here.
Okay, so I think we have all the resources we need.
-Chrissy! -Stinky.
You’re right. Something does stink.
I’ve got some work to do though. Do you think you can take care of it?
Aye aye, Mummy.
I'm back. Let's raid this dungeon!
Stinky.
Bye-bye, stinky!
Still stinky.
No stinky.
A little bit more…
Perfect!
Freddie, look. Our first customer!
Put the cap on!
Okay!
-Presenting… -The Rory Rubbish Truck Perfume.
Guaranteed to make you smell like the greatest rubbish truck in the world.
Well? What do you think?
Is that a no?
No more stinky.
Still stinky.
-I wouldn’t go in there if I were you. -What?
-I wouldn’t go in there if I were you. -What? It’s a real stinker. I don’t know who used the bathroom last,
It’s a real stinker. I don’t know who used the bathroom last, but might just be best to, you know, let it air out.
Chrissy, no!
Okay, it was me!
Stinky! Chrissy! Open up!
Yeah! We need to use the bathroom!
You wanna go first?
No more stinky.
Still stinky.
No stinky.
No stinky.
No stinky.
Oh no!
Chrissy stinky.
Teatime!
Hey, Chrissy. I see you found the smell.
I knew you could do it.
Wait. What the… Where's the toilet?
Sorry, you lose again! Take one on the house.
Yes! Jackpot! Come to mama!
-Welcome to the Lucky Lounge. -Here you go, boys.
Thank you, Miss Fenderson. Enjoy yourself.
This place is awesome!
-Only big ticket winners allowed. -Ticket.
You need way more tickets to party with the high rollers.
Better luck next time.
Too bad! Sorry! Too bad!
You lose!
Yeah!
No!
Chrissy not lucky.
Crispy! Combo! Awesome! Crispy! Combo! Perfect score!
Chrissy lucky?
Looks like you got a lucky penny. Hang on to it.
Lucky penny!
Yeah!
Big ticket!
Penny!
My tickets!
Come back!
Hey!
Thanks, Candace! Wait!
What?
Is somebody there?
Wait! Penny!
No!
-Good luck fishing today, Squint. -Luck's got nothing to do with it.
I finally got the white whale!
Lucky penny!
Get back here, you!
Penny?
You won’t get away!
Ticket?
Penny no lucky! Chrissy lucky!
Not enough.
Bro, look.
Right this way, Miss Carson. Welcome to the Lucky Lounge!
Welcome to the 65th annual Bumper-Ball--
It's game time. First, a quick word from our sponsor.
I'm gonna go upstairs and do some work.
-You're going to take a nap, aren't you? -What? No!
Morning, Mummy.
Morning. We're babysitting one of your friends today.
Yay!
Friend?
Hello, Chrissy Carson.
Bobby Mini Van.
I left a snack for you two on the table!
Fruit gummies!
Only one?
We've got the match of the century today! The long-awaited showdown between two fated rivals.
The long-awaited showdown between two fated rivals. The Mean Green Machines versus the Tin Can Vans!
Who will take the win? Who will come out on top?
Chrissy, look, ice cream!
Tin Can Vans have snatched the ball from the offence.
They head downfield. Look at that fancy wheel work.
Don't you dare!
They take aim. And goal! It's a goal for the Tin Can Vans!
The Mean Greens are left in shock. They don't get a second to celebrate.
Both teams scramble. I can barely see the ball! It's lost in the scuffle.
The Mean Greens have the ball. We're off to the races! A beautiful manoeuvre.
Go, Mean Green! Show 'em who's boss!
This kid's a regular twinkle-tyres.
It's a goal for Green!
The Vans manage to break away! It looks like a clean… Oh!
Wait. What just happened? A fan has come out onto the field and stolen the ball!
Can someone get stadium security, please?
Can no one get their tyres on that slippery subject?
Oh, they got him. The fan is down! They're really giving him a walloping!
Yay!
On with the game!
The match is heating up with no sign of slowing down.
I'm working!
They match point for point. The victory dances are nothing to sneeze at.
Oh yeah!
The wolves close in. Nowhere left to turn. Wait!
The wolves close in. Nowhere left to turn. Wait! A teammate is open, waiting in the wings like an angel.
Henry, catch!
A beautiful pass. And beautifully received.
I'm Honkin' Henry!
-Vamos, Mean Greens! -Vamos, Tin Cans!
¡Otro hermoso pase!
Thank you, Henry.
-Goal! -Goal!
It's all come down to this. One final goal will decide the match.
With seconds on the clock, who will take the championship title?
Another mad scramble. The play goes haywire. Cars are sent head over wheels.
The ball is in the air. It's anyone's game.
Come on!
It's all over, folks! It's a tie! A tie? Is that cherry?
Oh, look at you two having so much fun together.
How about some juice?
-Juice? -Juice?
There's only one left. I'll get some cups so we can split it.
We wouldn't leave you hanging! The match goes into overtime. Winner takes all!
Okay. This goes in here. And this--
Found me!
-Now Mummy hide. -Sorry, Chrissy.
Hop out of that box, please.
Chrissy!
Mummy, what's this?
We used to make home movies of you and Cory with this all the time.
Chrissy movies?
Probably. -Watch Chrissy movie! -Right now?
-Watch Chrissy movie! -Right now?
Please!
-Well, we can watch one. -Yay!
That one.
Here we go! Hi, Chrissy. Say hi to the camera!
Hi!
Okay, that was fun. Now I need to get back to--
More Chrissy movies!
I just have so much to do.
Can you see the kids?
Yeah, there's Cory, walking down the hill. Hi, Cory! Where's Chrissy?
When you’re hunting a ghost, you have to be very quiet.
Boo!
Oh, Chrissy’s first restaurant!
And what would Madame like to order?
-Potty. -Pardon?
Honey, that's the potty face!
Oh no!
Mummy!
Okay.
What do puppy cars say?
Bark!
That's right! And what do puppy cars do?
Oh no! Not that!
Now I wonder, who could have made all of this mess?
Chrissy tornado!
Yep, that’s our Chrissy.
That’s still our Chrissy. I think that was all of them.
Back to work.
More movie!
Are you excited for Mama and Papa to get home, Cory?
Baby!
Yep, I’m excited too.
Baby Cory?
-Yeah! -Cory, let them through the door!
-Yeah! -Cory, let them through the door! -Let me grab your bags. -Thanks, Mum.
-Let me grab your bags. -Thanks, Mum.
I wanna see! Let me see!
Slow down, bud.
Baby! Gentle.
Cory, meet your new baby sister, Chrissy.
Hi, Chrissy.
I’m gonna show her my toys!
These really are special times.
And they go by so fast.
Mummy go back to work now?
The weather looks fine.
Shouldn't we be outside searching?
Give us boats and we'll do the search ourselves.
Please, do not go near the ship.
Almost all of the bodies have been found.
The search is over.
Over?
Just like that?
Go kill yourself!
[man] Are we all just going home?
Be careful, Rita.
What about my granddaughter?
[crying] She can't stay outside.
Isn't there any other way?
I promise, we won't stop searching.
[woman 2] Why is the Coast Guard leaving?
Please include me in the 10:30 a.m. boat.
Of course, Mrs. Amado.
[in English] Leana, thank you.
[in Tagalog] You're welcome.
I'll take over from here.
-No, I can still do this. -No, you're very tired.
When was the last time you ate?
Why are you sad?
It's over.
Yes, it's over.
Everyone is leaving.
No one will ever come here.
Who else will come when that thing is still out there in the water?
Who will want to fish out there?
Money was already tight.
And now this.
-[sniffles] -Leana, maybe it's time to leave.
We're leaving?
It's sad here.
Rita should go to a proper school.
Just us?
One of the guests offered me a job in Manila.
You're leaving us?
I have a family. I need a job.
We're not leaving this place.
This is all we have left.
-Eddie! -What?
Where is Mrs. Amado?
-Why? Is anyone missing? -Just one.
Let them catch up, okay?
[Rita] Mrs. Amado!
Let's go, Mrs. Amado.
Mrs. Amado, it's time to leave.
[man] Leana.
Mr. Castro, your boat is leaving at 2:00.
We hope you keep this place open for one more month.
The Coast Guard has stopped the search.
It's over. They're leaving.
We will pay you.
Please keep this place open.
Open?
Open for what?
The current is strong under the Aurora.
It will get even stronger when the storm comes.
We think that...
there are still a lot of bodies trapped inside the ship.
There is a chance that the current will carry them here.
Are you asking me to wait for bodies to come ashore?
Fifty thousand for each body that you find.
I hope you didn't say yes.
Leana.
Don't give them hope. They are all grieving.
Let's not disturb the dead. Let them rest.
[Rita crying] Delia!
-We'll see each other again, Rita. -[sobbing]
Rita!
What do you plan to do with this place?
I'm not closing it yet.
Maybe another...
another month so...
so I can clean up.
I need to show you something.
This was what they looked like.
Crushed by metal.
-[screams echoing] -Squashed by cargo.
Drowned.
Even if you get out,
you have to swim in oil spills.
Flames.
I don't know why you're showing me these.
Because it's not your job to find them.
You're not going to find anyone.
If you're planning to look for help, let me remind you...
the ship is off-limits.
I have no plans.
It's sad here. There's nothing to do.
I miss Delia.
Don't worry.
We'll find fun things to do.
Okay.
Why don't you just teach me how to swim?
Before Father died, he said he'd teach me.
Can you teach me?
I don't know how to swim, so don't go near the water, okay?
That's not true!
I saw you swim before.
And you were so fast, like an elephant.
-Elephants can swim. -[laughs] Elephants?
And where'd you get that story? Are you making fun of me?
It's true! Eddie told me.
Well, that's not true. I don't know how to swim.
So promise me that you won't go near the water, okay?
Promise me!
-I won't! -You won't promise? [laughs]
-Elephants can swim! -No, they can't!
[faintly] I'm not an elephant!
-[Rita] You're an elephant! -You're not swimming!
-You're an elephant! -[Leana laughing] I'm not an elephant!
You're an elephant!
-How much? -[in English] Fifty.
Twenty-five...
Fifty! [in Tagalog] Here you go.
Ricky.
[exhales] Leana.
You're closing shop, too?
[Rita] I'm just gonna go there!
Don't go too far.
I'm done.
No one's buying my fishing gear anymore.
Uh, please, sit.
How are you?
[Ricky] How do you and Rita handle it?
You're so close to that ship.
We just stay inside.
Anyway, they're done.
The families have also left.
That's great!
[sighs] Even Delia left us. She's got a new job.
Philip's leaving, too.
He's a survivor.
The only one from here who was a passenger of the Aurora.
-He was there when it happened. -Philip, I didn't know.
How about you guys?
If you want, we can leave together.
Delia said the same thing, but...
we can't leave yet.
How much is this?
Uh, that's not for sale, but you can have it.
It's okay, I'll pay for it.
[Rita] Wake up, Leana!
They're back!
Wake up!
They've come back!
Wake up!
-Rita! -They're here!
They've come back!
Rita, throw that away.
No.
That will rot. It will stink.
No, it won't. It's already dry. Look.
Didn't I tell you not to go near the water?
I didn't go near the water.
Eddie...
I'm thinking of doing business with you.
Because you have your own boat.
You can go near the ship once every day.
I'll pay for your food and gas.
Fifty thousand for each body we find.
-Your wife... -Cecile.
If she wants, she can replace Delia here.
Take care of Rita
while I look for bodies that might wash ashore.
You can search the waters.
Are you not afraid?
They won't look like this anymore.
That's why I don't want Rita to see them.
So if you find one, bring it to the boatshed.
The Coast Guard forbids us from going near the ship.
That's why you can't tell anyone about this.
And never dive.
[Eddie] This is where I learned to swim and fish.
I know these waters better than the Coast Guard.
Okay. Fifty-fifty...
for each body.
This place is beautiful.
[Eddie] Of course!
We should be thankful to Leana.
The money will be a big help.
I told him it's dangerous.
[Cecile] Rita!
-Rita! -Rita, go back inside.
But I'm not gonna swim. I'm just here to watch Eddie.
No one goes out. End of discussion!
My goodness! There's nothing to do in this house.
Why can't you just listen to your sister? Go back inside.
Whew! That's exhausting!
There's nothing there.
I told you not to go near the rocks. It's dangerous out there.
That's not the problem. The problem is my gear. It's so old.
Okay, we'll try again tomorrow.
All right.
Rita...
sorry I was a bit cranky earlier.
There's just a lot on my mind these days.
It's very serious...
what we're doing.
It's okay.
I know that you're searching for dead bodies.
You're all right with that?
It's okay.
I also want them to go home.
We will do our best.
Okay.
We will find them.
They all want to go home.
They want to ride in Eddie's boat.
[Leana] Sure.
I doubt we'll find one today.
-Bye. -Why can't Eddie and Cecile
stay with us here?
We have enough rooms upstairs.
It's not that simple.
Why?
They have their own house.
And we don't really know them that well.
Mom and Dad wouldn't like that.
It doesn't matter what they think. They're dead.
Rita! Say sorry!
Rita!
Rita?
What's going on up there?
You're making a mess!
Where did you get Dad's shoes?
Rita!
I don't have time for games.
Why?
Why don't you just do as I say?
I'm closing off upstairs.
It's not being used anyway.
That's okay.
It was just the wind.
Is that Cecile?
She's with Rita.
A window broke last night. The wind was so strong.
I hope it gets even stronger so that ship will move.
Even just a little nudge will do.
Let's open this!
Wait, wake your sister up first.
Leana, wake up! Get up!
Leana, look at this.
[Eddie] See? There's a lot.
First, the flowers.
Now these.
The current really brings them back here from the Aurora.
I helped! Right, Eddie?
Oh, yeah! And you were so good!
-Rita helped out. -Didn't I tell you...
You were asleep and Cecile was upstairs.
I locked all the rooms upstairs. I can give you the keys so you can get in.
No need to. All the doors are open anyway.
Even the windows. It's a mess up there.
[Eddie] Next time,
I'll buy a bigger net and bigger hooks
so I can get more of these!
Ricky sells fishing gear. You can buy from him.
Sure.
I'll go to him. I'll also bring the rest of the cargo so we can sell it.
You're selling it?
Of course!
We'll sell it. That's money for us.
Are you selling everything?
Okay, not really everything. Go ahead and pick whatever you like.
Can I?
Please? Can I?
-Can I? -I'll choose for you.
Why can't I pick one for myself?
Because it's not yours.
You bought all that from selling the cargo?
Here. Fifty-fifty split, right?
Isn't that good?
Are you diving?
Why not? I know that ocean so well.
-What about those rocks--? -Everything! Even the rocks!
The undercurrent is so strong according to the Coast Guard.
What if you get swept away or pulled under?
Not today!
Wait, if you're not going to help me,
why don't you just babysit your sister?
Don't wait up.
What?
Go on. It's getting late.
See you later.
Wow! Eddie, I'm taking this one.
-What's that? -[in English] Noodles in a can.
[in Tagalog] There are noodles in cans?
-Eddie, you're teasing me! -[laughter]
Let's stop this.
Enough.
What?
We are not here to look for luggage or cargo.
We are getting paid to look for...
to look for missing passengers.
But this?
It's stealing.
I'm done.
I just...
I just want to find them because I made a promise. [inhales]
These things were floating in the ocean.
I just picked up some blessings.
-What do you want me to do? -This isn't ours!
We're taking advantage of the dead!
[sighs] Leana, the money we earned was all used for the search!
It was used to buy equipment and food!
So we can go on with this!
I'm sure the families want us to go on searching--
I want the search to continue
because I promised!
But I don't want to take from the dead.
Fine, if you don't want to.
You're perfect!
I'm a thief. I have no problem with that. If you don't want these, I'll take it all.
And everything else that I'm gonna get from that ship!
Eddie. Eddie!
-Eddie! Eddie! -[door opens]
Leana...
Ricky?
[man] Where is Leana?
[woman] Leana!
[man] With Ricky again? Grab the keys!
[woman] Let's go! Hurry up!
What do you think, Ricky?
I don't care about the money. You can have it.
I have some savings left.
I just really need your help.
-But isn't this Eddie's job? -Mine.
It's my job.
I was the one who had a deal with the families.
This is something else, Leana.
I have to admit, I am scared.
Always.
But wouldn't it be better if we find all the missing?
So this will all end.
My God.
I'll call the family.
Which family?
Anyone.
No, no, no! Let's call the Coast Guard.
-No! Don't. -[Ricky] What do you mean, "No"?
-I was the one who found the dead body. -Idiot! The dead body found you!
Oh, so I was found by that body? And how about you?
You did nothing. You didn't even go into the water.
You are such an idiot!
If I hadn't pulled you, there'd be two of you lying dead inside!
Stop it, you two!
I'll take care of this.
I'll find out who he is without causing trouble.
No one should know we're searching for bodies.
He stays here.
Rita should never see this.
Fifty thousand.
If we split that three ways, how much will each of us get?
You both can have the money.
Rita?
Rita.
-Why did you sleep here? -Hi, Leana.
I can't remember.
Get up now and take a bath.
Hello?
-[in English] Mrs. Castro? -[in Tagalog] Did you find Melencia?
Uh, not yet, but we found a man.
Was there anyone who...
I don't know how old he is.
We can ask the other families.
Who can this one be?
What we know is that there were many...
who were not on the ship's manifest.
-Stowaways? -No, not stowaways.
They paid and had tickets but weren't official.
I don't understand.
We think the Aurora was overloaded.
As long as there's money to pay, anyone can get on board.
It's a business.
Many shipping companies do it.
Is that legal?
Everyone is involved.
From the ship owners to...
maybe even the captain.
-Eddie, there's someone by the window. -Hmm?
-There's someone inside. -What?
-What's wrong? -I don't like it!
-I don't want to go there. -What?
I don't want to go in there! I don't like it! Take me back home!
-Wait! What's wrong with you? -Take me back home!
-Take me home! -Okay! Stop it!
-All right! All right! -Take me home!
[in English] "God sent the fish to save Jonah.
Jonah stayed inside the belly of the fish
for three days and three nights."
[in Tagalog] Oh, Rita, your hands are so cold.
I want to go inside now.
Now you want to go back inside.
-I still have so many things to do. -Like what?
Rita.
Do you want to go to the mainland?
I have a few things to do at the municipal office.
-I'll buy you a new dress. -Really?
Yeah, right.
Can I help you?
Rita, can you stay there for a while?
Is that for classified ads? Are you selling a house on the island?
Uh... no.
I'm looking for someone.
Missing persons. From the Aurora?
Candy, can you hand me the missing persons file?
[Candy] Hold on.
Here.
Maybe in here?
[woman] Try looking at these files.
Everyone here is missing?
The numbers went up after the Aurora tragedy.
But not all of them are from here.
We also get reports from other towns.
Found anyone?
The one we got--
Um, it's okay. I'm not really too sure.
Okay, why don't you...
leave your name, address, and your phone number?
It's okay. Never mind.
Thank you.
Rita, let's go.
Let's go home.
Leana!
[man] Pay first before looking!
No photos!
Rita.
Yes?
-Where are you going? -Just upstairs.
Don't go inside 2A, okay?
Rita?
Rita, are you really not listening to me?
-[hammer clatters] -[sighs] Rita.
[Rita] I know who you are!
Your name is Benjamin.
And you are famous!
You're in the newspaper.
I'll read it for you.
"The famous seven-footer..."
[in English] "'Boy Giant,' Benjamin David,"
[in Tagalog] "died of heart complications at the age of 28.
Benjamin had a genetic disorder called 'gigantism.'
A victim of constant bullying,
he ran away from his hometown when he was still a teenager.
His father will bring his remains home
via the passenger ship Aurora."
[man 1 whispers] It really is true. He's a giant.
[man 2] Hey! Not too close. No photos!
Just look, don't take photos. Hey! That's enough!
Good thing we found you.
-Now you can finally go home. -[eerie music playing]
We will take you home.
I don't want to go home.
I'll never go home.
[Rita] Leana! Our guests are hungry.
What should we feed them?
Leana! Our guests are hungry.
What should we feed them?
Philip.
I just wanted to know...
what really happened to the Aurora?
When are you leaving?
I'll come with you.
[Philip] We were packed like sardines on that ship.
There were too many passengers.
It was chaotic.
I even had a hard time standing up.
The Aurora was overloaded!
And then the ship smashed into the rocks, like this!
Do you know anyone who died?
A man who died on the ship?
Many people died.
But maybe you will remember this one.
He was tall, uh, like a giant.
How did you know about that?
There was a dead body aboard the ship.
He was like a giant.
The ship's crew was saying it was bad luck.
But a lot of passengers and crew still came to see him.
All the strange things that happened on the ship,
they blamed it on the dead man.
Blackouts.
Temperatures dropping very low.
They said it was because of him.
The crew said that the dead man didn't want to go home.
But some said that they saw him around the ship.
They're just stories the crew made up to scare the kids,
to keep them from being rowdy.
No one knows.
I don't know!
[in English] Human error.
Suicide.
[sniffles] All I know is that...
the last thing I saw was Leana's seaside inn.
It seemed so near.
-[crashing] -[people screaming]
[Philip] I jumped.
A lot of people did.
I thought it'd be easy to swim.
[sobs] But the sea was on fire.
[Philip] I thought I saw the giant,
the dead man...
on the bridge...
with the captain.
Leana...
I feel so cold.
[Leana] Let's get out.
Are you okay?
When the water rises, take a deep breath.
-Hold it as long as you can. -Like this? [inhales]
And never leave my side, okay?
-[boy] Mama. -[woman] Shh.
[woman] We're just near the shore.
Do you see that big house over there?
[captain in English over PA] This is your captain speaking.
[captain in Tagalog] We have a minor engine problem.
[captain over PA] Wait for further instructions.
[captain in English over PA] This is your captain speaking.
[captain in Tagalog] We have a minor engine problem.
Please stay where you are and put on your life jackets.
Wait for further instructions.
[woman] My child's missing!
[captain in English over PA] This is your captain speaking.
[captain in Tagalog] We have a minor engine problem.
Please stay where you are and put on your life jackets.
[captain in English over PA] This is your captain speaking.
[captain in Tagalog] We have a minor engine problem.
Please stay where you are and put on your life jackets.
Wait for further instructions.
-Where are we? -Hold tight.
[Rita in English] One...
two...
three...
four...
five...
six...
seven...
...25, 26, 27,
28, 29, 30...
-Forty... -[Leana in Tagalog] Ma'am, they're here.
-Fifty... -[Mrs. Amado] Leana?
-Melencia... I saw them. -[Rita continues counting]
[Mrs. Amado] Where is she?
-Leana? -[Rita whimpers]
Please call the Coast Guard.
Please call the families. They are all back.
-All of the missing. -Leana!
They've returned.
Leana! Leana!
[Rita] Leana!
-Rita! -Leana!
-Rita! -[people screaming]
-Rita! -Leana!
-Leana! -Rita!
Rita!
-Rita! -Leana!
Rita!
Rita!
Rita!
Leana! Leana!
Leana! Leana!
Leana! Leana! Leana!
Leana! Leana! Leana!
Look. The Aurora is gone.
There were still many more of them.
So crowded.
[voice breaking] They were screaming, crying for help, but nobody came.
-What? -Some were in the cargo hold.
There were children and babies.
They were trapped. The crew forgot about them.
Leana, how do you know this?
What happened here?
[in English] Mrs. Castro...
[in Tagalog] there were still so many dead on the ship.
And you knew all about it.
That's why you didn't want us to go near the ship.
She's gone mad.
I already warned you, didn't I?
That a storm was coming.
Aurora was overloaded.
So many people weren't listed on the manifest.
-Are you saying I'm a part of it? -Yes.
You, including the captain.
Leana.
I saw them, too.
Where are they?
They're all inside.
I'm sorry, Leana, but I don't know what you're talking about.
[Mrs. Amado] They're inside. Come on, let's go.
[woman] They're in here.
Why?
Wake up!
It's over.
Leana...
Thank you.
I'll go in and help.
Go home.
Leana?
What did you say?
I learned from the best. Come on, we're almost there.
Bad doggies!
Impeccable timing, little brother. Very dramatic.
Help him, Michelangelo. He's hurt bad.
That's it. The resistance failed. The Krang won.
But… but it isn't over. We've still got a ninja's greatest weapon…
hope.
That and a badass mystic warrior.
Mikey, we need a time gateway.
It'll take everything I have. I know, but this is our last chance.
It's our only chance.
-Wait, what's going on? Where is he going? -Casey, listen.
The Krang first came to our planet through a mystic doorway.
The key that opened the doorway looked like this.
Why are you telling me this?
Because Mikey's about to send you back in time to the day that the key was stolen.
Wait, he's gonna what?
The people who stole that key opened the doorway for the Krang.
You have to find it before that happens. Find the key, stop the Krang.
-But, Sensei-- -Say it!
"Find the key, stop the Krang."
I don't want to lose you. Casey, it's not about me.
They found us!
Mikey!
Master Michelangelo, no! You're gonna--
Casey… when you're done saving the world, do me a favor.
Grab a slice!
-[cars honking] -Where…
I made it?
All right, Casey, here we go. Find the key, stop the Krang.
♪ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ♪
Easy does it, Leo.
You've got this.
Concentrate.
The whole world is counting on you…
to break the pizza box stack record!
One-hundred, twenty-five boxes!
They say it couldn't be done, but look who's doing it, moi.
That's Spanish for Leo.
Go ahead, my non-lingual friend, count your unhatched fowl.
My record stands until you reach the top, which, according to my calculations of wind speed,
barometric pressure, and dew point, is highly unlikely. What?
According to my calculations,
as long as you believe in yourself, you can do anything!
Thanks, little brother. No one believes in himself more than me.
Leo!
Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo!
Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo!
-Yeah! [chuckles] I am Leo! -Yeah, baby!
[Raph] There you are.
I've been looking all over for you guys.
Raph, guess who just broke the record?
What? You did? How many did you-- [grunts]
Stop distracting Raph! We were supposed to be training--
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Hold that thought.
Donnie?
Donnie?
You, sir, have bested me. Mazel.
-Ahem? -Ahem?
Leo. Leo.
Leo! Leo!
Stop it! Leo, we have work to do, and you dragged him out here for this?
Training, record-breaking. The choice was clear.
[Raph sighs] Dang it, Leo. Everything's not about you.
When are you gonna grow up and start acting like a hero? And there it is. Gentlemen…
-What was that? What are you guys doing? -A little game I invented.
Every time you say "heroes," we take a bite of pizza.
I don't say "heroes" that often!
Leo!
So what if I say he-- that word a lot.
It's a good word. We need to be that word.
Relax, Raph. We've got this hero thing wired.
I mean, our ninjocity is off the charts. We've got some kickin' mystic weapons.
And do I need to remind you who has four shells and defeated the Shredder?
-[Leo] Hey. -[Raph] Leo!
You just don't get it. -[beeps] -Huh? What is all that-- That's me.
Looks like we have a 317-39.4 in progress!
Oh, come on! Has nobody read Donnie's Big Book of Bad Guy Codes? Nobody?
-Nope. -Never gonna happen.
We did it! We got the whatcha-ma-hoosie-doodle!
Of course we did. Nothing can stop Supervillain Warren Stone
and his conjuring compatriot, Hypno-Potamus! -[tires screeching] -[honking]
There they are! Okay, here's the plan--
Raph, relax. Who needs a plan when we got crazy cool mystic powers?
Leo!
Come on, swords, it's portal time!
I'll see you guys later after I save the day! Buh-buh-bye!
Stop! We need to work together!
Wellington Sunday! It's those pesky Turtles.
License and registration.
Oh, I'm sorry, mate. I must have left it in my other jacket.
Leo! Ah!
Leo, we're coming.
Don't worry. I got 'em right where I want 'em. [moans]
Doesn't look that way to me. Donnie, Mikey, Maneuver 12.
-On it! -Ha!
Whip-o-rama!
Prepare to be Donnie'd by my mystic tech!
Oh boy.
Okay, creeps, hand over the stolen thingy!
Oh no.
That's gotta be what they stole!
I got it!
With those clumsy hands? [chuckles] No, I got this one.
Oh, you portal-chopped him!
"Portal-chopped," I like it. Maybe my new catchphrase?
Okay, let's see how it fits. "You've been portal chopped!"
[Foot Lieutenant] Uh-uh-uh-uh. I'll be taking this.
The Foot Clan?
Finally, after all these centuries, this is ours.
Yes, well, of course, thanks to us, delivered safe and sound.
No problemo, partner.
Hey, just quietly, are we partners? We are partners, yeah?
Oh man, that thing must be dangerous if the Foot Clan wants it.
Ya think?
Huh? What?
[Raph] I clearly said, "I got it." Everybody heard me say, "I got it."
Yeah, but I got it with style.
[Raph] But you didn't get it!
You lost it, and now we've got a Foot Clan situation, Leo.
What's it gonna take for you to be serious, Leo?
And end up with a worry line between my eyes like you? No, no, no, I do not want a Raph chasm.
"Chasm"?
You know, valley, gorge, crevasse.
The only reason I have a chasm is I have to worry about you bozos 24/7.
You just don't get it, Leo.
I'm the oldest here.
I'm responsible for keeping us safe
and making sure we can handle anything that comes our way.
'Cause if I don't, you could all end up dead.
Sorry, I missed that.
Can you repeat everything from… well, everything?
No wonder you always want to train. You really need the practice.
Let him go, Mikey.
Wait! No!
Boys! Stop this arguing!
But, Dad, Leo keeps--
No more.
You are a team. You are brothers.
And most importantly, you are too loud! I cannot hear my TV show!
Tristan finally proposed to Annabelle, but did she say yes?
I don't know because of you!
Be the ninjas I taught you to be,
respectful and quiet!
Sorry. Excuse me.
Hey, how am I supposed to find this thing?
So many people.
How am I gonna save them all, Sensei?
I really wish you were here.
Wait, you are!
I just need to find you.
April.
She'll know.
Hi, professor. Do you have a sec? Hmm.
Are you even in this class?
I'm April O'Neil, journalism major. I write for the Eastlaird University Daily News.
Maybe I could get some shots of you at the whiteboard for a story?
Oh! Of course.
-[farts] -So, uh, what… what should I do?
You know, just write something sciencey.
I actually have the perfect equation for your article.
Now a few where you're staring thoughtfully at your work.
[Professor] Oh, I always stare intently at my equations. Especially this one.
You know, I think I should put on my lab coat.
-Look at it! -Oh! Okay.
You know, I could probably stare at this equation all day.
This is April O'Neil, investigative reporter, Eastlaird University Daily News.
For years, this college shot down rumors that a foreign government is paying them millions
to develop a super-toxic herbicidal deforestation bomb.
Those rumors end today because I'm about to blow the lid off Big Chem.
April O'Neil.
-Ooh. This stuff looks nasty. -[shutter clicking] -Hey! Who's there? -[gasps]
Evidence, baby.
Oh boy.
Well, it's a good thing video ain't the only thing I took.
April! Yes!
-Commander O'Neil-- -Catlike reflex!
What's the matter with you, creeping up on a person in the dark?
What the…
And then I saw that picture and I brought him here.
Sensei?
It's you!
It's all of you! Together!
I never thought I'd see you again! I'm so happy I could hug you! [groans]
Who are you, and why do you have a picture of us?
Yeah, who took this? 'Cause I look great.
What's your favorite pizza? 'Cause I'm ordering right now.
And why are you wearing genius-built apparel?
That's trademarked!
Grappling hook!
What's going on?
-[Mikey] He's trying to escape! -[grunts]
-Want me to knock him out again? -Let me.
Donnie? Donnie!
Oh, okay.
Wa… Wait, stop! I'm a friend. Let me explain.
Let's start over.
My name is Casey Jones, and the reason I have this photo
and your tech is because you gave it to me,
but not yet, because I'm from…
the future!
This isn't a joke.
Please, if time travel is possible, future Donnie would have come back
and already given me all the lottery numbers like we planned.
It's true. I need you to believe me. Humanity depends on it.
In the future, an alien race decimated the planet.
We were hunted. We lived in caves. We ate leaves and rats. No offense.
None taken. We are delicious. [gulps]
I know how this sounds, but Master Leonardo gave me a mission.
I do like how he calls me "Master."
Of course I do.
You are the greatest ninja the world has ever seen.
You told me to find the key and stop the Krang.
"Aliens." Pfft. Sure. This story just keeps getting better.
Splints?
"The Krang"?
I have heard that name.
Powerful, barbaric creatures worshiped by the Foot Clan.
Legend says they came from the stars.
Ruthless, unmerciful, with one desire,
to enslave our world like so many before us.
All seemed lost, until great mystic warriors forged a mighty weapon,
a key that was used to lock them in a prison dimension beyond this realm.
Over the centuries, the mystic key remained hidden
to protect humankind and prevent the return of the Krang.
So…
Future boy is really from the future?
Mind… [imitates explosion]
Someone finds the key! Today!
They steal it and use it to open a doorway and free the Krang!
That's why I came back, to find it first.
Master Leonardo drew a picture on the back of that photo.
So to stop the Krang, all we have to do is find the key before it's stolen.
What?
Yeah, did future handsome, amazing me tell you what to do in case that already happened?
'Cause that already happened.
Oh no, we're too late! [sighs]
No, we're not. 'Cause we know who has the key, the Foot Clan.
Okay, we gotta find them before they use it, and this time, we do it together!
Uh, can someone untie me now?
[Hypno-Potamus] Villain to villain, your hideout is a bit… lacking.
Might I suggest some velvet, a fireplace, maybe a fuzzy white cat with a diamond necklace?
Tonight, we liberate our masters from their dimensional prison.
With this key, we shall free them to lay waste to this world and enslave its people.
Ah, I thought we were just gonna rob a bank and be, you know, crime buddies.
We shall follow the Krang as they lead the Foot Clan to glory!
-[Leo] Bored. -[gasps]
You!
-Leo! -What?
I was waiting for a good spot to jump in, but they just kept blabbity-blab-ing.
There it is! That's the key.
Get them! Don't let them interfere with the ceremony!
No!
-It started! -[groans]
He's unlocking the doorway! We need to get up there right now!
Casey, go. We've got you covered.
[gasps] Oh no.
Oh no! They're here!
Then let's make sure their visit's short and sweet.
I'm finally free!
The people of this planet will pay for what they've done to me.
Welcome to Earth. I hope you don't enjoy your stay!
Enough tricks!
Mikey! Donnie! No!
No…
Raph, what happened to our powers?
They… They're gone.
What did they do to us?
Brother, sister, join me.
Time for us to finish remaking this universe in the image of Krang.
How I've waited for this day.
Indeed.
Brother, widen the portal and retrieve our ship, the Technodrome.
Once it is here, this world will kneel before us.
Oh, if you two don't mind, I haven't killed anything in ages.
Hot soup!
No!
Retreat! Retreat? We don't retreat!
Leo, for once, listen to me. They're too powerful and Dad's hurt.
You don't understand.
If we don't close that doorway, it's only gonna get worse.
Raph?
I'm not gonna argue with you, Leo! Donnie, escape pods, now!
You don't have to tell me twice!
Sensei, we need to get that key!
-[Leo grunts] -Leo!
Raph?
Raph, wait, no.
Wait, Raph! Raph! No, Raph! Raph! No, Raph!
[computer] Escape pods incoming.
[computer] Congratulations on surviving, fam.
-Huh? -[grunting]
[Donnie] Oh, I hate that.
Everyone okay? Anybody hurt?
How did we get here?
Donnie pods. We've never had to use those before.
So, how would everyone rate their escape experience? "Very satisfied," "Very, very satisfied," "Extremely satisfied"?
"Very satisfied," "Very, very satisfied," "Extremely satisfied"? -Donnie! -Sorry. Sorry.
-Donnie! -Sorry. Sorry. Data collection calms me down. -[groans] -[gasps]
Splints.
This is terrible! Why did we leave?
In case you didn't notice, we were getting our butts kicked!
-[strains] -But my mission was to stop them!
Now, the Krang are using that key to bring in something that will destroy the world.
We lost.
-Where's my other pod? -Where's Raph?
Ah, did you know this would happen? Why didn't you tell me?
-What are you talking about? -Easy!
-Leo, what's going on? Where's Raph? -Leo, what happened to Raph?
[Splinter] Leonardo?
They…
They got him.
You left Raph?
He left himself. He used his pod to save me, all because I went after this stupid thing.
You got it! Nice.
"Nice"? They captured Raph!
He's from the future! He knew this would happen!
No, I didn't. This didn't happen in my time.
We changed the past, and you got the key.
That means there's still a chance to stop them.
-No, we have to save Raph. Come on. -Leo, wait.
If you won't come, I'll go myself.
-We've lost our mystic powers. -We don't have a plan!
We don't need a plan.
"I'm the greatest ninja the world's ever seen," his words.
Shouldn't we talk about this before we run off all half-cocked, willy-nilly, pell-mell?
I keep being told I'm doing this hero thing wrong.
But I got the key, didn't I? I get results, so now we're doing it my way.
My son, listen to your team.
This is not about you. They made it about me when they took my brother.
Trust me, I got this.
Donnie, you're driving.
What do we do with this?
We can't just bring it with us, but we can't just leave it behind.
Then we should destroy it.
Splints and I will stay here and take care of business.
Thanks, Commander O'Neil.
"Commander"? I like the sound of that.
Oh, look at it.
-[groans] -Disgusting.
-[grunts] -Try looking in a mirror.
Ugh, it's talking at me.
I'm going to rip out its tongue. [Krang 1] Forgive my sister.
She's got a bit of a temper.
And being in prison for a thousand years hasn't done her any favors.
You're not human.
What are you? Let me go, and I'll show you.
You're more powerful than the people of this planet, yet you defend them.
-Why? -It's my duty.
A word used by the weak.
Many planets before yours have spoken of duty.
They too have been consumed by the Krang.
And now our glorious crusade continues
to restore the natural order of things.
The strong will devour the weak.
Last I checked, we weren't the ones locked in a prison dimension for a thousand years.
That's called "trash talk."
A rare misstep.
Once I retrieve the key from your comrades, I will bring forth the mighty Technodrome,
and you will witness the true power of the Krang.
Now, where have they taken my key?
It won't tell you anything.
Let me kill it.
Lady brain face here is right. I'm not telling you jack.
You don't have to tell me.
I'll look myself.
There it is.
They always do it the hard way.
Our brother and I will secure a location for the dimensional doorway.
Take these soldiers and retrieve me my key.
We live to serve.
You will serve me whether you live or not.
[Casey Jones] What is this thing?
[Donnie laughs] Hold on to your gluteus maximi!
The Turtle Tank, baby! It's how we roll in the past.
I mean, the present. I mean… -Ugh! Time travel's confusing. -They're on the move.
-Ugh! Time travel's confusing. -They're on the move.
According to the subcutaneous tracker I put on Raph--
Wait, does that mean you put trackers on all of us?
"No"?
No, of course I did… n't.
Based on their trajectory, they're headed… …to the tallest building in the city.
That's right, Metro Tower.
I heard the story so many times as a kid, but I never thought…
"And behold,
from their perch atop New York City, the Krang ripped open the sky itself."
"What came out was terror, and what rained down upon us was worse than death."
They told that to kids?
Man, the future is harsh.
I'm not gonna let that happen. We need to get into Metro Tower without being spotted.
We'll take the subway tunnels. Subway tunnels don't offer much in the way of an escape if we need it.
-Are you sure about this? -Yeah, maybe we should--
Guys, we're doing it my way. Remember?
Prepare the site so we may bring forth the Technodrome.
Yes, brother.
See? Smooth sailing. We'll have Raph in no time.
I hope he's okay.
How are we gonna find him once we get there?
I have a lot of questions regarding "once we get there."
Relax. We'll do what we always do. Ninja in, ninja their faces, ninja out.
That's exactly how you freed all those families from the Krang labor camp.
Yeah, that sounds like me.
In the future, you guys are beyond amazing.
The mystic powers you're able to harness are on a whole other level.
Of course! What about my future? I'm expecting big things for me.
How many Nobel prizes do I have? Don't tell me. I wanna be surprised.
Donnie, you were the most brilliant, innovative mind of all time.
I'm shocked, I am. Go on, continue to meet my expectations.
What do I do in the future?
You are the most powerful mystic warrior the world has ever known.
With those two hands, you sent me back in time.
Actually, there is something I should tell you.
[Turtle Tank] Auto brake engaged.
Think we're in the right place?
Looks like the Metro Tower station is on the other side of those vines.
Great. Let's hoof it.
Through the disgusting, drippy slime jungle?
I know. I know. Leo knows best, but I'm not sharing my hand sanitizer.
[Leo] Feeling a lack of rush in this rush hour, right?
[Donnie] I don't know, Leo. Something feels…
off.
Don't worry. I won't let us die. I'm a mystic warrior.
"I feel better already," he said without a hint of sarcasm.
Look, the stairs.
Sneaking in from below was the right move. Those slimeballs will never see us coming.
[April] We tried to jackhammer it, flamethrower it, pour acid on it…
I thought lasers cut everything! How did that not work?
There's not even a scratch!
Maybe it was your aim.
Maybe your big rat head got in the way!
Mmm, I'll show you, fat rat head.
Okay, deep breaths.
You said some things, I said some things. Maybe we should just get back to saving the world.
What's next?
This cannot be good.
April O'Neil!
[Krang 2] Come back here!
-[tires screeching] -[Splinter] Faster.
Faster!
I knew this was a bad idea.
Leo, there's too many. We should go back.
No, we're gonna get to those stairs.
Leo, we're not gonna make it! We have to turn back.
We push forward, get Raph, that's final.
Mystic hands!
Donnie! Mikey!
Oh no, Donnie, your soft shell! You're exposed!
We gotta find shelter!
Oh, oh, keep it down, Vomitello!
Oh. Keep it down, daddy!
Run, insects, but you can't escape!
[sighs] Don't!
The key, human! Give it to me!
What did you do to me? What did you do to my face?
I knew that stuff was nasty! I told y'all!
Yes, yes, you're a genius. Let's go.
[April] Donnie, come in.
They found us. Where should we go? Donnie?
[Donnie] We're trapped.
We are trapped in the subway under Metro Tower.
The tank is running on emergency power and is covered in some kind of Krang bio-growth.
-I repeat-- -April, come quick! We're getting squished!
We're on our way!
But, April, how will we get them out?
I've got an idea.
Yeesh. Remind me to never get on your bad side.
Casey! [moans]
Casey, you okay?
Donnie, Mikey, anybody?
What the heck was that?
Some kind of drippy, crazy Krang monster.
No, I mean you! Why weren't you listening to anybody?
Because I was trying to get us into the building!
That sure worked out well. I was doing everything right. How could it go wrong?
Because you weren't listening to your team! You don't have all the answers all the time!
I'm the greatest ninja the world's ever seen. You said that.
[sighs] I was wrong.
What?
You're impulsive, you're arrogant,
and you don't see that every decision you make could cost someone their life.
You want to know what really happens to your brothers in the future?
They die. Everybody dies fighting the Krang.
The world needs Master Leonardo.
And all we got is this guy.
We have an update on the strange situation at Metro Tower.
All contact has been lost with those inside the building,
and conflicting reports suggest something is barricading entrance for emergency personnel.
Fools.
These creatures should welcome the power of the Krang.
You on the rooftop! Stop and surrender immediately!
[reporter] We've got eyes on the roof top where the police are confronting--
What is that?
You may begin. [roars]
[man] Look out!
-[strains] -[Leo] Look, I know I'm not the Leo you knew in the future, and maybe I never will be.
This whole time I was sure my family needed me, but the truth is I need them.
If we're gonna survive this, we have to do it together.
[Turtle Tank] Hull integrity, 4%. Breach imminent. Good luck.
Whew, good. We have an imminent amount of time.
"Imminent" means "soon," Mikey.
Don't worry. I'll save us with my mystic hands.
Casey must have been wrong about me.
This is it, Donnie. We're gonna get crushed!
-[April] Knock-knock! -April?
Anyone order a rescue?
Boom goes the herbicide!
April!
You saved us! Uncomfortable with emotion!
Where is Leo? And, uh, Future Boy?
Somewhere in there.
[Krang 2] Faster! They're this way.
I can smell them. [laughs]
-[screaming] -She found us! We gotta move now.
Oh man, is this what the future looks like?
Nope, the future is worse. Much worse.
Donnie, Mikey, do you read me?
[Donnie] Come in, Leo.
Donnie, where are you?
We've extracted from the subway and are ascending a staircase.
I'm getting a lot of interference, but if you hold still, I can triangulate your position using a complex geo-location algorithm.
-[Casey Jones] Uh, Donnie? -Odd numbers, primes, no… almost.
-Almost! -[Splinter clears throat]
Ugh. I never get to use my algorithm.
Man, I am so glad you guys aren't dead.
Ditto.
Okay, before this gets too mushy, we need to locate Raph.
Can you tell me if he's in the building?
Bet your momma's subatomic particles I can. Got him! He's close.
He's almost on top of us. Wait, he is on top of us.
[all] Raph!
Quick, cut him down, get him out of there.
Hang on. We got you. Almost there.
Raph?
Surprise.
What did you do to my brother?
Improved him.
Thank you for this. We will be putting it to good use.
Come, the world awaits destruction.
Tear them apart!
We gotta move.
-Leo, move! [grunts] -No!
A shame our brethren didn't survive the prison dimension.
Then again, their weakness has no place in my new Krang empire.
Open and bring unto this world
the mighty power of Krang!
[radio] Warning! This is a warning! …appears to be something falling from the sky--
Begin!
[Mikey] What do we do now?
I fear we are lost. The Krang are too powerful.
Maybe we could change the future some other way.
Guys, it's time to face facts. We can't change the future.
Says who?
Says the grandfather paradox, says physical determinism, says the space-time continuum.
Look, I didn't want it to be true, but…
[sighs] …science.
That's it! Donnie's wrong.
The world is ending, yet the barbs continue.
Don't you remember? We already did change the future.
Raph never got kidnapped and turned into a Krang zombie in your time. -Right, Casey? -No, he didn't.
-Right, Casey? -No, he didn't.
That means we did change the future! We're just in a different… [stammers]
Bifurcated time branch?
Yes, yes, yes, that nerd thing.
You know what that means, right? We still have hope!
A ninja's greatest weapon.
Hey, I like that!
[sighs] Look, I'm done thinking I have all the answers. I don't know how to beat the Krang,
but I do know our future isn't written until we write it as a team.
So what do we got?
Maybe…
Maybe we don't have to beat them. Can't we just send them back to the prison dimension?
There's an idea! Donnie, what do those big, beautiful eyebrows have to say?
If we got control of their ship, we could send it back through the portal.
Yes! Yes! Now we're cooking. Who else?
If someone on the ground can get to that key…
We can close the doorway.
And then bye-bye Krang forever, baby!
Exactly. What do you say, Donnie? You ready to fly a space ship?
Literally the greatest question I have ever been asked.
All right, team, we have a plan. Let's go save the world.
Wait, but what about Raph?
That big jerk may be covered in goo and half alien, but he's still our brother, and I'm not giving up on him.
but he's still our brother, and I'm not giving up on him. I'm not leaving him behind.
There's the key. Let's go.
Like Casey said, let's go!
[Donnie] I wish my tech was working! Usually, my cardio is jetpack-assisted.
I'm not getting credit for any of these steps!
Hey, question, is it too late to join April's team?
You two figure out how to hijack this ship.
I'm gonna find Raph.
So how do we hack this thing?
[Donnie] Best guess, main console? Unfortunately, it's ocupado.
[Mikey] Uh, new plan.
Run!
Surprise. I've come for my brother.
Let me guess.
Duty.
[chuckles] He said doodie.
I see you got yourself an upgrade. You'll pay for what you have done to me!
This psycho routine is a little thin. Where's the character development?
[Casey Jones] Leo's counting on us to get to that key. I think I have an idea.
Cover me!
Raph, you're coming with me, whether you like it or not.
I don't want to fight you, but I will if I have to.
Oh, you will have to.
Bravo, Mikey!
There's no buttons, or computers, or anything.
Just a lot of drippy, ooey-gooey disgustingness.
I don't know how to hack in…
Oh God, I know what I have to do.
What?
No, I don't think I can do this.
-What are you talking about? -[gulps]
Oh no!
That's… [wretches] …so gross! -I can't do it. -I believe in you!
-I can't do it. -I believe in you!
-No, it's my worst nightmare. -I know.
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
Raph, I know you're in there somewhere. You've gotta snap out of this!
Do you feel what the power of the Krang can do?
I am saving this weak planet!
I am a gift!
It's not working. I need more of a connection.
Mikey, take off my battle shell. No, you're too vulnerable with just your soft shell.
There's no time, hurry.
Donnie? [yelps]
Mikey, I am…
a spaceship!
I'm trying to save you, you idiot! Why do you have to make things so hard?
You want to keep coming at me? Go ahead. I'm done fighting you.
What?
No!
Finally, man and machine
entwixed in perfect bionic synergy!
How dare you desecrate Krang's ship!
Donnie, Mikey!
I don't want to fight anymore.
I was fighting you because I didn't understand you, but now I get it.
I always figured you were mad because you didn't like the way I did things.
But when I see what's happening to you, and what's happening to them…
I realized it wasn't about me.
You didn't yell because you were mad, you yelled because you were scared.
It's scary to be responsible for the lives you protect.
Your team… your family,
but we do it anyway because that's what it means to be a hero.
If this is it, I want you to know I finally understand.
And I'm sorry.
Raph, Raph, there you are! Come back! Your family needs you.
-Leo? -Yes!
Mikey, Donnie, we can fight this.
Raph's doing it for us, so we do it for him.
That alien jerkface thinks we're weak because he hasn't seen what we can do…
when we fight together!
It's pointless to resist Krang.
Give up! You will be consumed like everyone else on this pathetic planet!
-[yells] -Fat chance.
We're not like everyone else on this planet. We are…
…the Teenage…
-…Mutant… -…Ninja…
…Turtles!
If this isn't the poster shot, someone's getting fired.
-[thuds] -Oh, we are not done yet.
April O'Neil!
That's payback.
Keep her under that building until I bring it down.
Yeah!
Casey, get out of there!
Commander O'Neil!
Nice shot.
Donnie's almost got the ship to the other side. I have to get to the key.
See ya.
Come in, Sensei, it's Casey. Can you hear me?
Come in, Sensei! Can you hear me?
Okay! Donnie!
Cowabunga!
[Mikey] Flip-o-rama!
Let's roll.
Ka-zoom!
Raph, go.
On it!
Gotcha! Don't worry, Donnie!
This is not a hug. It's a rescue!
Where are we? Staten Island?
Oh, gross.
So how would everyone rate that rescue experience? Unsatisfied?
Very unsatisfied? Wish Donnie would have done it? Um-hum?
-[grunts] -Donnie.
Leo's still up there.
Casey. Casey, come in.
Sensei, I'm here. And I've got eyes on the key.
Tell me when you're home free, and I'll pull the plug.
Casey, listen to me. When I get to the other side, you close that door.
What? Sensei, no!
[Leo] Casey, it's the only way. He's too strong.
He's not gonna stay on the other side unless I keep him there.
[Casey Jones] There has to be another way!
[Leo] We tried everything, Case. This is the only way.
Leo, please don't do this! Leo!
You're one to talk, big bro. Hero moves are totally your style.
Outmatched and alone, yet you persist.
For what?
Honor, redemption?
Sacrifice? All meaningless.
We'll see about that.
[Casey Jones] Leo, please! I can't lose you again.
[Leo] Hey, future me would be real proud of you. I'm proud of you.
Weak words, weak actions.
I have forever known what you fail to understand,
strength always prevails!
What you fail to understand is I missed on purpose.
No, enough of your little tricks.
Casey, close the portal now.
What?
No! Let go of me!
Casey, please.
You've been portal chopped.
You…
You've ruined everything!
And now… [chuckles] …my wrath will be reserved for you alone.
You think you've won, you wretched little pest?
Wipe that grin off your face!
Mikey, it's over.
Leo never gave up on us.
I'm not giving up on him.
Whoa. Mikey, whatever you're doing, don't stop!
We're here, Mikey. Together.
[sighs] Took you guys long enough.
[Raph] Leo!
-Leo? -Hey.
Eww! Are we in Staten Island?
-Come here! -Aww!
No pictures.
[Casey Jones] So this is "grabbing a slice"? I don't get it.
Wait for it.
So much better than rats! -Mm-hmm. -Hey.
Hey, the rest of the world we saved is pretty great too.
All right, everybody, look up here.
April, you just got a message from someone named "Cassandra."
Looks like our friend Cassandra has been busy.
That's my mom! There goes the space-time continuum.
-[April laughs] -You did it, little brother.
You really did it. I'm proud of you.
[gulps] This wasn't about me. It was about all of us doing what needed to be done
because we're heroes.
[laughs] You said "heroes."
There it is, gentlemen, our home.
What a town.
Beautiful.
And if it needs defending, we'll always rise to the challenge.
Speaking of which, you know what challenge I'm gonna rise to?
-Beating that record! -Yay!
No way! No, okay, fine.
"We are delighted to confirm your admission to
The College of Advanced Technology."
Our Father who art in heaven
may You always be with my son, Peter Andreas
may You always be with my son, Peter Andreas who is now leaving his childhood home.
May he never forget the plight of life

Amen.
I have saved up some money
which I meant to give to you when you left home.
But since you have chosen a different path...
...you get nothing.
You will, however, get a gift.
This watch, which my father gave to me on the day that I left home
I give to you, in the hope that it will soothe your hardened heart.
And open your obstinate mind.
When, one day, you turn away from the path to perdition

Hit me again like you normally do.
Beware! Beware His intrepid curse!
Since Father is predicting my future, he should know that in this house
Since Father is predicting my future, he should know that in this house I've always felt like a stranger and a homeless person.
-Exiled be he who defies The Lord! -Amen!

Here is a little something for the journey.
And remember, if you need help, your older brother is in Copenhagen.
Thank you, Mother.

This is it. The rent is due every first in the month.
In Darcy's Law, we see a crucial coherence in proportionality
between the water flow in the ground and the elevation difference
between two points. But what constitutes this coherence?
Yes?
There is an exponential coherence between the acreage and the water flow.
A proportional coherence. The larger the acreage, the larger the water flow.
What are you doing, Mr. Sidenius? It's a system of canals
which will cut through Jutland and connect the two oceans.
It will shorten shipping travel and connect the new towns.
In the middle of class? Have I not asked you to refrain from conducting
these foolish, conceited experiments?
The canals will branch off to the marshy areas
The canals will branch off to the marshy areas which can be drained and made cultivable by using Darcy's Law.
Listen, Mr. Sidenius. A young man like you
needs no other ambition than that of acquiring knowledge.
Understood?
Yes, sir!
Do you have any work available?
-Only for one night. -Thank you.
I'm studying for an engineering degree. I needed some money.
Unfortunately, they only needed me for one night.
-Do you often pick up random objects? -No, it's for a project of mine.
-What did you do before? -You're a curious soul.
-I used to be a model. -Really?
-For fashion magazines? -Stop it, you nitwit.
I posed at The Academy of Fine Arts.
-Like... Do you mean naked? -Of course.
-For men too? -Of course!
You really are a nitwit. There were only men present.
It was fun.
I would tease them by applying lipstick and painting my eyelashes.
Really?
Venice went from being an insignificant city
Venice went from being an insignificant city to one of the world's largest commercial centers
because they built a sophisticated canal system.
I'm calculating how to turn Esbjerg into a lagoon city
with elevated trading posts.
Imagine electrical gondolas sweeping through the streets of Esbjerg
carrying travellers and their goods. Duty-free, of course.
Right, nitwit! No more engineering stories.
He's smiling at you!
It's peculiar how older men are attracted to you.
Please be quiet.
But he'd not be a bad partner.
And consider your age, Jakobe. You can't live like a nun forever.
Besides, he's wealthy. So he wouldn't take you for your money.
Besides, he's wealthy. So he wouldn't take you for your money. Please be quiet, Nanny!
I enjoyed spending the summers in Denmark with my family.
But when the cold set in, I wanted to go back to Switzerland to the fresh air.
How long did you attend the girls' school, Miss Salomon?
Five years. I made friends from all over the world.
Jakobe speaks six languages and has a degree in literature and history.
I see.
Mr. Ivan, I understand that you've decided to seek out new talent.
-That's very commendable. -Yes. The future lies with the young.
We're always looking for new investment opportunities.
But why do we have to contend with the ill-mannered and failed geniuses you keep bringing home?
the ill-mannered and failed geniuses you keep bringing home?
Mr. Salomon...
Most humbly, I wondered if I might talk with you in private?
Of course, Mr. Eybert. Let's withdraw to another room.
I owe you an explanation as to why I'm really here.
It involves... I don't know how to phrase it. It involves...
...the state of my heart.
Would it be presumptuous of me to ask for some water or coffee?
Agnes? Please pour Mr. Eybert some more coffee.
Thank you.
Where were we? Oh, yes! The state of my heart.
It's my intention to honour Miss Jakobe with my affection.
Mr. Eybert, of course my wife and I have noticed where things are headed.
You come from good Jewish stock and are also a friend of the family, so...
Let me not mince matters.
I assume you've considered the disparity in years between you and my daughter.
Hasn't that coffee been sufficiently stirred now?
Oh, yes.
I also assume you've considered my daughter's position in life.
And my testamentary dispositions regarding her.
The state of her finances has not been decisive in this.
As I said, it concerns the state of my heart...
As I said, it concerns the state of my heart... You know that I hold you in high esteem
You know that I hold you in high esteem so of course, in principle, you have my blessing.
However, ultimately Jakobe decides her own future.
I have something which might interest you.
I have something which might interest you. A book, or rather, the Holy Bible.
It was a gift from the vicar who conducted my confirmation.
-A prominent man, rector Sidenius. -How do I know it's not stolen?
He dedicated it to me on the front page.
"Always observe the strict laws of the Church."
15 øre. 15 øre? I imagined... I would have thought...
15 øre? I imagined... I would have thought...
-Excuse me? -Yes?
-Who is that gentleman over there? -Ivan Salomon.
-Salomon? -Have you not heard of the Salomons?
No.
-The bill, please. -Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir?
May I steal a moment of your time?
My name is Peter Andreas Sidenius. I study engineering.
I hear that you're looking for people with ideas. Geniuses.
I would like to present a couple of my inventions to you.
-May I sit down? -Please.
I've thought of a new way of winning energy.
Instead of using expensive coal, we could utilise nature's own power
Instead of using expensive coal, we could utilise nature's own power the wind and the waves.
With a sophisticated system of canals and locks, it will revolutionise...
With a sophisticated system of canals and locks, it will revolutionise... Your receipt.
This will turn Denmark into a modern, self-sufficient industrial nation.
And I was told that... you're the person to involve in such a project.
-Do you come here often? -No, I...
Then we can continue our talk at some other point.
You must excuse me. I have a meeting.
He was right there! I've never seen anything like it.
He was right there! I've never seen anything like it. His elegant clothes, his whole...
His is one of the richest families in the country. Stinking rich.
This could be the chance of a lifetime.
Mr. Engineer... Come here.
By the way, I was thinking... Could you lend me some money?
How do I know if I'll ever get it back?
You know you can trust me.
The thing is... I need to go back to the café, in case he shows up again.
It's important. Have you considered, that if you and I joined forces...
Have you considered, that if you and I joined forces...
...and found a place to live, everything would be so much easier.
Yes. That's a great idea.
-So will you lend me the money? -Sure.
-You can have my tips from tonight. -Thank you.
-Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
This is what I could take home. The customers ate most of the red cabbage.
This is what I could take home. The customers ate most of the red cabbage. But there's plenty of roast pork.
And as many caramelised potatoes as you can eat.
To think, this is our first Christmas together.
Thank you.
I understand if you're thinking about your family.
No, quite the opposite. I was thinking about Ivan Salomon.
Sometimes, I wish I were rich.
Yes, but you aren't, Lisbeth. And you never will be.
Yes, but you aren't, Lisbeth. And you never will be. But what if I was?
I would donate all the money to your project.
I completely forgot...
-Cheers. -Cheers.
To you and me.
Mr. Sidenius! There you are!
Come and sit down.
I've asked my friends from The College of Advanced Technology about you.
-Are you hungry? -No, I...
-Are you hungry? -No, I... -Caviar and champagne, please! -Yes, sir.
Well, Mr. Sidenius... Sit down.
Sit down and tell me about your project.
Well...
Society needs someone like you.
Someone who proves that the unique and ground-breaking is possible.
I'm currently calculating the required water flow proportionate to acreage.
How to connect streams and lakes via canals.
You create an irrigation system and utilise uncultivated meadows.
-At the same time... -Please stop, Mr. Sidenius.
Come to my house for dinner. I want my father to hear your brilliant ideas.
-But... -Let's be on first name terms.
-Ivan. -Peter Andreas.
The project must be submitted to
The project must be submitted to Engineer Colonel Bjerregrav from the Danish Society of Engineers.
Engineer Colonel Bjerregrav from the Danish Society of Engineers. He can recommend it to the ministry, which in turn can endorse it.
You're a bit of a world conqueror. You're truly...
...a fortunate man.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was busy securing our family's future.
You're drunk!
Let me introduce you to my sister Nanny. This is Mr. Sidenius.
Mr. Sidenius studies engineering, but is already a genius.
Well, I never! What does being a genius feel like?
Are you just going to stand there?
Be careful, you don't freeze to the spot and turn into a lamppost.
I live in that direction.
I've invited Mr. Sidenius to dinner on Sunday.
Well, I'll see you then, Mr. Genius.
Remember to turn your feet around, if you're going in the other direction.
Don't forget to submit the project to the Engineer Colonel! It's crucial!
Hello.
I wish to hand this project to the Engineer Colonel himself.
The Engineer Colonel is in a meeting. But if you give me the drawings
But if you give me the drawings we'll contact you when the Engineer Colonel has seen them.
Are you sure...? I was thinking perhaps...
-Right. -Thank you.
-Will he look at all those drawings? -Yes.
Thank you.
There we go...
And, if you don't mind, I'll just pull out your cuff.
There we go. And the other one.
You've probably wondered about the condition of my clothes.
You see, I've just returned from a long stay in Panama
where I oversaw construction of a large canal system.
where I oversaw construction of a large canal system. -Quite dangerous, I'm sure. -Indeed.
-This is for you. -Thank you.
Well...
That's impossible...
I think I left my wallet at the hotel.
I'm sorry.
Why don't I send my chauffeur over with the money?
He'll be here within the hour. Good day to you.
You cannot leave the shop without paying.
Are you accusing me of being a fraudster? Do you know who I am?
Hello. My name is Peter Andreas Sidenius. I have an appointment.
Welcome inside.
-Let me take your hat. -Thank you.
Follow me.
Please have a seat here.
Managing director Delft. I'm the uncle of the family.
-Sidenius. -Ah, the young engineer!
My nephew told me about you. A fortunate man, he calls you.
Not a very flattering name in my opinion. What is it they say...?
Fortune favours fools.
-May I sit down? -Please.
My niece is very agreeable, don't you think, Mr. Sidenius?
Miss Salomon is beautiful.
Very beautiful.
She is certainly not a common girl.
And I can assure you, she attracts a large number of young men.
What beauty is capable of!
Besides, my brother-in-law Philip Salomon is not without means.
Because money, Mr. Sidenius, is a magnetic force.
Those little pieces of metal evoke the deepest human emotions
and the noblest excitement of the heart. Am I not right?
Well... Let's say hello to the family.
Thank you.
There you are! You are anxiously awaited.
Father?
This is Mr. Sidenius, who I told you about.
-Welcome. -Thank you.
-This is my mother. -Welcome.
You have a very beautiful house, Mr. Salomon.
And the wine is exquisite.
And the ladies... You're surrounded by beautiful ladies.
Cheers, Mr. Salomon, and thank you for letting me visit.
This is my oldest sister, Jakobe.
-Hello. -Hello.
Maybe you could tell us about your project, Per?
My father is curious to hear.
My starting point is... As modern society evolves
the access to energy sources will be crucial.
And he who holds the key to supply, also holds the key to the future.
We must break away from coal-based energy, which won't last forever
and instead harness the massive force and energy which is found in nature.
Yes.
Please continue.
Let's look at the infinite rows of waves
that discharge their roaring power on the coast every day.
Why not harness that power?
I want to accumulate that power and connect it to huge turbines
so that electricity can be sent out to the whole country via cables.
The same goes for windmills. All that untapped, restless wind which...
...whistles through the country, can be harnessed and be of benefit to everyone.
Imagine, Mr. Salomon, whole cities with houses and long streets
railway stations and factories, all illuminated by electric light
which we've harvested from the wind and the sea.
You also mentioned something about a new, international seaport.
-If you imagine a Danish Venice... -Thank you. That's splendid.
And quite expensive, I imagine.
How do you imagine implementing this project?
The drawings have been handed to Engineer Colonel Bjerregrav.
Father knows him. So fingers crossed.
Goodnight.
Your friend's ideas are fascinating. But he seems like a dreamer.
He may be immature, but he's an intelligent man.
I was particularly impressed by his predictions
that he who controls the energy, holds the power and money.
But is he someone we want to be acquainted with?
Doesn't he seem a bit disingenuous?
What's that word...? A scatterbrain.
I found him to be boorish. Did you see how much he had to drink?
Yes, he seemed slightly ill-mannered.
In his defence, remember that he grew up poor.
The son of a clergyman.
It's sad to see how being poor leaves ugly scars on a person.
It's sad to see how being poor leaves ugly scars on a person. And he wasn't as handsome as you said, Nanny.
I find him unusually handsome. I find him totally magnificent.
Magnificent?
The Engineer Colonel will see you now, Mr. Sidenius.
Excuse me, are you the engineer Sidenius?
-Yes. -Good God! You're so young!
Well, let's talk about it.
I find your idea of hydroelectric turbines to be utter madness.
But some of your solutions in wind power seem quite sensible.
How did you ever come up with this preposterous project?
I have spent the past year on it.
But it's something I've been thinking about ever since I was a boy.
Are these your drawings? Let's have a look.
I'd like you to elaborate on the control system for fiords and canals.
-Please speak in a clear voice. -Yes, sir.
I want to construct a control system for harbours and fiords in Jutland.
This would enable faster waterborne travel
which could turn Denmark into a modern industrial nation.
I want to move shipping traffic out of Copenhagen.
A free port here would never become a centre for world trade
as the location of the city makes it hard-to-reach for international vessels. I want to establish a large port on the west coast
I want to establish a large port on the west coast which would enable us to compete with Hamburg and Bremen.
which would enable us to compete with Hamburg and Bremen.
It would be a kind of a Venice of the North.
You are of a fortunate age.
And speaking of which, young man, posture. Straighten your back.
Let's meet again in a week.
-Am I dismissed? -Excuse me?
What a blithering fool! Authoritarian jerk!
"Posture, young man! Straighten your back!" I know the tune.
Clean nails, say grace, don't whistle, have nice table manners. I feel sick.
But he asked me to come back in a week. It's half a victory. We must celebrate.
It's half a victory. We must celebrate.
Champagne? And caviar, of course.
-Yes... -Let's join the family.
What's wrong? This is one of the best restaurants in town.
Of course...
My sister Jakobe's fiancée, Eybert.
...especially since the girls' mother died, I couldn't...
...especially since the girls' mother died, I couldn't... I don't understand what she sees in him. All clocks stop when he enters a room.
I don't understand what she sees in him. All clocks stop when he enters a room.
He's a widower, and his children must appeal to her protectiveness.
But I do understand what he sees in her.
She's the oldest sister and therefore the one who will inherit the most.
I made a point of being careful.
Mr. Eybert.
Hello. Peter Andreas.
Jakobe.
It's lovely to see you again.
Yes, so that was really something. That's when I founded the company
which is now one of the largest in the country in the field of sewerage products.
in the field of sewerage products.
We're ready to order.
Gentlemen. Ladies.
We were thinking caviar and champagne, what do you think?
-Yes. -Yes.
What's on the menu?
Trout roe and quails' eggs served on a bed of ice
followed by wildfowl and asparagus, omelette and cheese with celery
and for dessert, fruit. We'll take it all.
-Please serve the champagne now. -Yes, sir.
Per visited Engineer Colonel Bjerregrav today.
He more or less authorised the project. He is a terribly officious person.
"Speak clearly! Straighten your back." No, you do it much better than me.
-What did he say? -No, no. Please excuse me.
Still a bag of nerves? It's the last door on the right.
-Hello. -Distinguished company.
I almost didn't recognise you. And such classy ladies.
I almost didn't recognise you. And such classy ladies. The young man must be Ivan?
Exactly. And therefore, can we please pretend we don't know each other?
-Am I not classy enough? -Yes, of course.
But this is important to me.
It's important to my career, so if his family discovered...
...this thing about us...
Please, just pretend you've never seen me before.
In essence, I want to harness the forces of nature.
Of course, without exploiting them ruthlessly.
This applies to the hydroelectric system and the canal system which will connect all the corners of the country.
and the canal system which will connect all the corners of the country.
Let me ask you a question, Mr. Sidenius.
By all means. I'm curious...
You're studying for an engineering degree, right?
Yes.
How come that a young man such as yourself, who, I'm told
hails from several generations of clergymen
chooses a technological path?
-You don't care for my profession? -Yes.
It just seems so antagonistic.
-Science versus faith. -Exactly.
But is that contradictory?
Consider how important engineering has proved to be to humanity.
I mean, how it has shortened distances between people via the railway.
And the telegraph.
Not to mention that we might one day have machines that fly.
Consider how it can eliminate differences between people
Consider how it can eliminate differences between people and thus become the final step
and thus become the final step
towards our vision of global brotherly understanding.
Isn't that an exaggeration?
I'm convinced that free movement can break down prejudice
and create a regenerated, just society
and create a regenerated, just society where the individual will be able to live as a free and independent person.
where the individual will be able to live as a free and independent person.
I wonder...
I must admit to never thinking about my profession in such a magnanimous way.
Would you care for some water, Miss Salomon?
Thank you.
Ivan, you should hear this. The doctor has completed his thesis on geniuses.
Please, Doctor, tell me. I collect them.
May I, Miss Salomon? I wish we'd had the chance to talk a bit sooner.
Please don't misunderstand, but your wise words were so enriching.
In fact, visiting this house is an altogether enriching experience.
Although I cannot deny feeling a bit...
...inferior.
I'm not used to the open and free habits of your family.
Or rather, the way you're preoccupied with the events of the world
as something you can learn from. That's different from my family.
We began and ended the day by turning away from the world
singing hymns and praying.
Can you imagine that just being beautiful and well-dressed like you
Can you imagine that just being beautiful and well-dressed like you would be considered dishonest to God?
When I think of my childhood home...
...there's always a feeling of shame.
And eeriness.
I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Sidenius.
You haven't paid rent.
-You will have your money shortly. -A gentleman is waiting in your room.
-Did he give a name? -He didn't look very pleasant.
And remember to pay the rent!
Eberhardt?
I apologise, but the caretaker said you'd be back shortly.
-I've been home for a few days. -I see.
Father has suddenly been taken ill.
The doctor thinks it's most likely cancer.
I thought you should know. We, that is all your siblings...
We thought that when you learned of Father's illness
We thought that when you learned of Father's illness you might feel encouraged to
you might feel encouraged to or rather feel the need to seek rapprochement.
or rather feel the need to seek rapprochement. What do you mean?
-Can you continue to justify... -Don't interfere in my affairs.
Right! I see that I'm wasting my time trying to talk sense to you.
-As you please. -There's something you should know.
Although your stubbornness prevents you from accepting it
Father is more concerned with you than with anyone else.
He speaks of you every day.
They've given up trying to talk you round.
Instead, they're hoping that someday, life will change your mind
so you will realise how much you owe them, and repent and reconcile.
so you will realise how much you owe them, and repent and reconcile. Owe? Repent? Sin? I've heard that before.
Owe? Repent? Sin? I've heard that before.
How vulgar to use Father's illness to lure me back.
You want me to subject to you because you cannot tolerate
You want me to subject to you because you cannot tolerate that I might be doing well outside of your world. I am!
Tell the man who calls himself my father, that I owe him nothing!
He took my childhood. That's enough!
What are you staring at?
You think you'll be proven right?
At closer examination, I've found your project to be of no value.
It's too immature. Besides, you're too young to accomplish it.
You haven't yet graduated. Your name is Sidenius?
You haven't yet graduated. Your name is Sidenius? Are you related to the renowned clergyman?
I don't see how that's relevant? Can you tell me...
...why you changed your mind about my project?
I apologise if I raised your hopes.
I'm certain that by turning you down, I'm doing you a favour.
A favour? Your theory of hydroelectric turbines, windmills and canals is simply...
Your theory of hydroelectric turbines, windmills and canals is simply... ...too naive. Too juvenile!
The only possibility the project has of coming into consideration
would be if I myself got involved.
That is out of the question.
Indeed.
Well, that means that the case, as far as I'm concerned, is closed.
Thank you for coming. That'll be all.
As a former soldier, perhaps you could tell me
precisely how humble you expect me to be, before you will endorse my project?
Have you lost your mind?
Please understand that this is my final refusal. And please leave!
-You will regret this. -Are you threatening me?
If I had known what a pig-headed, narrow-minded old fool you are
I would have never submitted myself to this insult.
Goodbye!
Where have you been? What are you eating?
Sewage water? Waiter!
I told you to ask uncle Delft for a loan. It's nice of you, Ivan, but it doesn't matter anymore.
It's nice of you, Ivan, but it doesn't matter anymore. -What do you mean? -Bjerregrav turned down my project.
-What do you mean? -Bjerregrav turned down my project.
He mocked my life's work.
You're too young, Per. Your ideas are too extreme. You must go abroad.
My father is in touch with a large engineering company in Austria
which is involved in dam and canal projects. Professor Pfefferkorn.
They would like you to come work for them.
Listen to me! You need to get away from Denmark.
Away from roast pork, mediocrity and Bjerregrav.
Go forth into the world.
Find inspiration, get a chance to show yourself and your project.
Cheer up! Show them who you are. Show them that you're a fortunate man.
You promised to visit us at the country house.
-I know, but I can't... -Stop it. It's exactly what you need!
The whole family will be there.
Both my sisters will be there. Both of them!
Upon my word! Mr. Sidenius.
-Miss Nanny. -Oh, stop it!
-Miss Jakobe. -Mr. Sidenius.
Let me welcome the young genius to our holiday home.
I hope the train was on time.
There's just one thing, before the others join us.
Please, sit down.
Thank you, Ivan.
The money will be transferred on the first of every month.
And please keep track of all expenses.
Of course.
It's important that you stress to Mr. Salomon that I consider this a loan.
-Against the profit from my invention. -Duly noted.
Can I ask you a slightly tactless question?
I have noticed that Mr. Sidenius is changing lanes
as far as Salomon's daughters are concerned.
And that Mr. Sidenius is now courting my oldest niece, Jakobe.
It would be an impossible dream to court a woman with so many assets.
You mean the pecuniary assets?
-Excuse me? No, of course not. -Of course.
Please sign for the money on the line.
-Mother? -Yes?
Can we please precipitate my engagement to Eybert?
If you wish.
We feel great respect for Eybert. And he's from a good, Jewish family.
And Father knows his financial situation.
Are you sure you love him?
Mr. Eybert makes me feel secure. And we have wonderful conversations.
Besides, his daughters need a woman around.
Do you think that your friend would agree to
Do you think that your friend would agree to apologise to Mr. Bjerregrav?
Yes. And while you're at it, ask the Tsar of Russia to step down.
The responsibility of deciding the fate of such a visionary project
shouldn't fall on such a narrow-minded technocrat as Bjerregrav.
-I agree. -But surely...
From an investment and societal point of view
I'm very impressed with young Mr. Sidenius' ideas.
If we could harness the forces of nature that we thought to be an enemy...
But Bjerregrav needs to approve the project.
He's Denmark's official technical expert.
He's the only one who can recommend the project for governmental approval.
Father... What if you contacted Bjerregrav?
-Would that change his mind? -Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Let Per travel a bit. Go to Austria to meet Professor Pfefferkorn.
Then we can learn what he thinks of Per, and find out if the project is tenable.
That was impolite in the middle of that passionate song.
You haven't looked at me since you arrived!
I'm sorry.
Have you lost interest in me?
Is it because you find me childish and simple-minded?
Why would I do that?
I have plenty of other suitors, as you well know.
-I'm sure. -From better families than yours.
And with much more realistic plans.
Just be honest. Have you lost interest in me?
Excellent.
What do you want from me? Can't you just leave me alone?
Since we last spoke, I've thought of nothing but you.
Does your sense of tact not tell you to stay away from me?
No.
You have touched me in a way no one ever has. I need to know what you feel.
You're beautiful.
You're intelligent and rich, and I'm... I'm nothing.
I think you're overestimating how you feel about me.
I don't need to explain. My engagement to Eybert has been arranged.
Now, where have the children gone to?
They can stay here and play cards.
Where's Nanny? She knows we're going for a ride.
If she's upset, just leave her be.
Please move further along. Fine, then I'll do it.
Here you are.
This makes me think of the story of the young, Swedish student from Lund.
He made a bet that he could catch a stag on foot.
After an hour of running, he dropped down dead. His heart exploded.
Do you really believe that?
I heard it as a boy, and even then I didn't believe it.
-It sounds credible. -So you believe it, Mr. Sidenius?
I believe that a self-respecting man will accomplish what he sets out to do.
Whatever the cost.
The fact of the matter is that the deer is equipped with four gallopade legs.
It's not only about speed. It's about determination and stamina.
So you think determination exceeds the laws of nature?
I'm sorry to hear that you've lost faith in the power of determination.
What's your point?
Would you regain your faith in determination if you saw proof of it?
In that case, I'll do it right now.
Mr. Sidenius! Get back in the carriage!
Stretching one's legs is good for you.
Besides, think what it could do for Denmark
Besides, think what it could do for Denmark if a member of Parliament regained his faith in determination.
if a member of Parliament regained his faith in determination.
I can't let you run alongside the carriage.
Then I'd better get ahead.
You see, I kept my word.
Was that a bet?
I just felt a little dizzy. I didn't even need to run so fast.
Miss Jakobe, your flowers.
Your flowers.
You love me, do you not?
You want to be mine.
You want to be mine.
You love me.
Isn't it so? You love me and want to be mine.
You want to be mine.
Am I not right?
Yes.
Yes!
When the dam is completed
we'll be able to prevent flooding further down the valley.
It happens almost every year when the snow melts.
And when the power station is ready, we can supply electricity to the area. It provides opportunities for everyone who lives in this part of the country.
It provides opportunities for everyone who lives in this part of the country.
Mr. Sidenius...
Guten Tag, mein lieber Freund. I hope you're doing well in Austria
and that Professor Pfefferkorn is looking after you.
We had so little time before you left.
But even though the days flew by, love demanded its rights.
Every moment spent with you, I treasure as one of the happiest of my life.
My dear Per, it's been too long since I heard from you.
Just a few words from you would make me happy.
But I'm sure you're keeping busy.
All day yesterday, I expected a letter from you.
I was upset and went to bed at ten o'clock
and hated you with all my heart. Until eleven o'clock.
My darling, can't you forget about engineering for a while
jump on a train and get home quickly?
And kiss me. Just one kiss.
That would feel wonderful.
Do you know that you've never said you love me?
Just once, I should like to hear what it sounds like.
You can practice before we meet again.
Then it will be a mutual confession.
What's up with Jakobe? Did you see her at the table?
Poor girl. She's jealous because she wasn't the first to get married.
She's positively fuming because she's not the one
dancing her wedding dance with Per.
Tell me, my dear sister... Is that the reason for the rush?
-Whatever do you mean? -You wanted to be the first.
You never forgave him for rejecting you. You're bearing a grudge.
You're drunk!
Concentrate on dancing. You're treading on my shoes.
-Are you enjoying yourself? -Yes, Mother.
-Do you miss him? -Of course I do.
-Do you miss him? -Of course I do. Especially tonight.
-There's something about him... -What?
-There's something about him... -What? I don't know...
There's something about the rootless part of his personality
that we don't understand. And we haven't even met his family.
Do you know if they even know about your relationship?
Yes. Before he left, Per met his brother in the street
and told him that we're engaged.
It's not our place to interfere, but are you sure?
-Sure of what? -That you and Per are well matched?
Are you sure your relationship is not unnatural?
That your social standings are not too different?
That his Christian background will not clash with our Jewish faith?
His uncompromising hatred for his whole family...
I've made my choice, Mother. I love him.
Yes. Fine.
We just wanted to make sure that you were confident in the relationship.
Hello. Where might I find senior clerk Sidenius?
-First floor, fourth door on the right. -Thank you.
-It shows. -Yes, a Jewish tart.
Come in!
Hello. My name is Jakobe Salomon.
I know that your brother has told you about me.
I've come here to try to come to a mutual understanding.
Your brother, Per, my fiancée to be, has felt estranged from his family.
Is this conversation your idea?
Yes.
Does my brother know that you're here?
-No. -I see.
It's only too true that ever since his childhood
my brother has separated from his family.
He systematically hardened.
He's found some kind of pitiful joy in defying us.
Even the ones he first and foremost owes gratitude and reverence.
Even now, when our father is on his deathbed
he won't open his darkened heart.
His attempts to break free go as far as his Christian name.
-You call him Per. -Yes.
I won't hide my opinion. And I assume you're looking for an honest observation.
And I assume you're looking for an honest observation.
Namely that this, his engagement to you
is part of a rebellion against his home.
I'm sure you know that Peter Andreas comes from a Christian family.
He knows that to his parents, Christianity is the all-important power.
And that they don't recognise happiness, which isn't rooted in Christian piety.
And if it means anything to you, I can tell you in no uncertain terms
that you can't expect an approval of his liaison with you.
I came here with the hope of reconciliation.
I see now that I was naive.
And yet, I don't regret my visit.
Excuse me? Is there any mail for me?
Sorry, Mr. Sidenius. No mail today either.
Thank you.
Mr. Sidenius! There's a telegram for you.
Thank you.
Has something happened?
It's from my brother.
My father died in the night.
Please accept my condolences, Mr. Sidenius.
You are welcome to go home right away.
No thanks. As you wish. If I can be of any help...
As you wish. If I can be of any help...
-A lady wishes to speak to you. -That must be a misunderstanding.
A foreigner. I think she arrived on the train.
On the train?
Good evening.
How...?
-Did I surprise you? -Please, come in.
So you did miss me.
And now I'm here.
My dearest friend, Per.
A thousand times my friend.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I could have sent a carriage.
I didn't know whether to come. But I felt I had to visit you.
I couldn't tell my parents about it.
So I told them that I was visiting my old friend Rebekka in Breslau.
-And you're staying? -For two days.
-You must be hungry. -Yes.
Uncle Delft read your father's obituary in the newspaper.
I'm so sorry, Per. Has it been hard?
No. I was relieved not to feel anything.
No. I was relieved not to feel anything. Almost like an acquittal.
You two could have reconciled.
If you had confronted him, perhaps things had been different.
You and I must be honest with each other.
We must confide in one another.
I have a confession to make.
Please don't be upset.
I went to your room in Copenhagen before I left.
I missed you so much. I needed something of yours near me.
And I wrote you a letter. But I never sent it.
I brought it with me.
My dearest Per.
My dear friend.
I could weep with joy at how mortified I feel
because I have worried about you and doubted you.
Not until now did I understand the kind of person you are. What you are made of, and what made you who you are.
What you are made of, and what made you who you are.
Your grandeur is also a contradiction in terms...
...which has grown from the pressure of small-mindedness and superstition.
It explains your feebleness but also your immense strength.
Your disdain and wilful power.
Now I finally understand the importance of social justice.
Due to my slowly coming to understand you and your background
I have realised why I feel a dark and reluctant connection to the hungry
the poor, and the people who fight for light, air, and dignity.
Those people who belong to the future.
Thank you.
This is the life, Jakobe. A life of freedom.
I still can't believe that you travelled so far just to see me.
I would travel round the world three times just to have one minute with you.
Maybe now's the moment to declare it.
Yes. Declare what?
I...
-I... -I...
-...love you. -...love you.
Oh no! I hadn't noticed it.
-What's it doing here? Let's move. -No. We have our backs to it.
Just enjoy the beautiful view.
-Do you hear that? -What?
Can't you hear them? The church bells.
They won't leave us alone anywhere! It's as if they're following me!
Per...
-See how he flaunts his impudence. -Per!
Look at his abject humility and how he exposes his misery.
Look at his abject humility and how he exposes his misery. -I hate it! -Stop it, Per.
When has anyone ever spat their disgust in your face?
Stop it!
Stop it now. Per! What's got into you! Stop it now! Stop it!
Stop it, Per. Stop it!
Look at me. Stop it! Stop it now.
Look at me.
Sometimes I feel like the hill troll
who crawled out of his hole to be with humans.
He discovered that the light was too bright.
The sun's rays were too bright
so he went back into the hole and cowered in fear.
Back to the darkness.
Go to sleep. It's been a long day for both of us.
Well, Mr. Sidenius. Are you happy to be here?
Well, Mr. Sidenius. Are you happy to be here? Very happy.
In the past few months, I've learned more than at college in Denmark.
Good to hear. I've been studying your project.
Some details are disputable.
Especially the fascine revetment and the retaining walls.
And also in the draft for the fiord regulations regarding the lateral works.
And also in the draft for the fiord regulations regarding the lateral works. Of course, Professor.
But as a whole, Mr. Sidenius...
...I'm very impressed.
You possess an unusually fresh and graphic understanding
of the forces of nature and how to harness them.
Thank you, Professor. If you knew what that means to me.
Thank you, Professor. If you knew what that means to me. I sincerely hope that the Danish nation appreciates your enormous talent.
I sincerely hope that the Danish nation appreciates your enormous talent.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
My dear friends and honoured guests.
Today is a very special and moving day for me and my wife.
We are pleased to announce the engagement of our oldest daughter Jakobe to Per Sidenius.
of our oldest daughter Jakobe to Per Sidenius.
On a day like today, I feel like making a short speech to the couple
who have now said their first official "I do".
Let me start with you, Per, my future son-in-law.
You're probably the most stubborn person I've ever met. For better or for worse.
Mostly for better.
When I think about how persistently you fought to make Jakobe yours
and how unyielding you have been in fighting for your national project.
You went to Austria to study under Professor Pfefferkorn.
He unequivocally gave his seal of approval to Per's ideas.
Isn't that something?
And I'm happy to inform you that we have formed a consortium
of affluent people who want to support your project, Per.
Seen from a financial point of view, it looks as if
the project is capable of being realised.
You're fortunate man. I think the future lies at your feet.
Good afternoon, or rather, good evening.
That unpleasant man was here again. He left you a letter.
-I can only offer you water. -No thank you.
How long has Mother been in Copenhagen?
When your father died, I had to leave the rectory.
I had nowhere else to go, so I wanted to be near Eberhardt.
You look very elegant.
And you've acquired fine manners.
Your brother tells me that you've found a wealthy family
who pays for your lifestyle.
Eberhardt and I agreed to spare your father the distress he would have felt
Eberhardt and I agreed to spare your father the distress he would have felt at learning of your relationship with the Jewish daughter of a rich man.
A fortunate man, they call you. What manner is that?
What did Mother wish to speak to me about?
You didn't attend your father's funeral.
But until his last breath, he hoped you would return to the grace of humility.
He wanted me to give this to you after his death.
That's why I asked Eberhardt to look you up.
The watch was special to your father.
And let me tell you, Peter Andreas
why he insisted to his last breath that I give it to you.
As a young boy, your father was going away to grammar school.
His father demanded to have the key to his suitcase so he could check what he was bringing.
so he could check what he was bringing. Your father felt very offended, so he left without saying goodbye.
Your father felt very offended, so he left without saying goodbye.
When he arrived at the school in the evening, he opened the suitcase...
...and found the watch you're holding.
He realised that it was a gift.
It was meant to be a surprise.
Your father cried violently.
And in repentance, he walked throughout the night
all the way home, flung his arms around his father's neck
and asked for forgiveness.
It was on that night, when he humiliated himself...
...that he found the path back to the light. And to peace of mind.
And to Our Lord in Heaven.
Never forget what your father said.
Exiled be he who defies The Lord!
I think I'd like that glass of water now.
There's a kitchenette out there.
-And you're quite sure? -Yes. You're pregnant.
-When will you be finished with that? -Two minutes.
With love from Jakobe. She hopes the meeting goes well.
I've been waiting for this since I was a boy.
How many of your father's friends will attend?
Seven or eight.
-What on earth is that? -It was delivered yesterday.
I had it made in Vienna. Does it look like me?
To a T.
People are completely unaware that in a few hours, we will make history.
We are laying the foundation for the new national works.
-It's big. -It's a quarter to ten! Hurry up!
In order to connect all corners of Denmark
and make the regions part of modern society
we must break away from the notion of the blessings of pork and butter
and instead make the peasant society part of the whole nation.
And as I said by way of introduction, my canal project
combined with hydropower and windmills is crucial.
I promise that your investments will not be wasted.
When Denmark becomes self-sufficient, money will flow in.
Thank you for taking the time to listen to the plans for Denmark's new works.
This consortium, which is made up of private, independent investors
This consortium, which is made up of private, independent investors has done some calculations, and we have reached the conclusion that
has done some calculations, and we have reached the conclusion that
the project is financially feasible.
This, of course, is subject to ministerial permission.
We know that Mr. Sidenius has been in touch with a high-ranking official
and that the meeting for personal reasons
concluded in an unfortunate way. We have been in touch with this person.
And when, in a moment, he enters through that door
we ask that you give him the unreserved apology he's expecting.
Please, Isak.
Gentlemen...
Do you seriously think that I owe him an apology?
But what for? What for?
But what for? What for? You must understand that I cannot accept any kind of tutelage.
You must understand that I cannot accept any kind of tutelage. I drew up my project without any form of supervision or intervention.
I drew up my project without any form of supervision or intervention.
I cannot allow it to happen now.
Presumably you know, that without Engineer Colonel Bjerregrav's approval
the project is not feasible.
I want to make it clear that the Engineer Colonel insulted me.
He mocked my project!
So he should apologise to me.
Are you refusing to apologise?
Yes. I resent having to apologise to an old, power-crazed tyrant.
A legalist who lacks vision! I'm sorry.
Is that your final decision?
Absolutely.
Well, that concludes matters for today, gentlemen.
The consortium is hereby disbanded.
I assume that none of you have any regrets
about the outcome of this meeting.
Imagine having to apologise to that power-crazed, uncompromising person.
-Who was being uncompromising, Per? -You too?
Would a small apology matter that much if it could save your project?
Yes, in my world. I'm astonished by your attitude.
You always say that the end justifies the means.
This confirmed the rotten connection between money and those in power.
And that's apparently something you support.
What do you mean?
If I'm to follow your rule of conduct...
-...then this is the last time we talk. -What are you saying?
You're prerequisite by birth to value these traits which I seem to lack.
I didn't hear that.
The outcome of today's meeting
was very disappointing to my colleagues and me.
I refuse to be bullied by that tyrant. Especially on such an important project.
In future, please remember the position you hold
within my family, and conduct yourself with the necessary elegance.
And with dignity.
Am I being clear?
Yes, sir.
Jakobe?
-Did you hear? -Hear what?
Come and sit next to me.
Is your mother's name Kristine Margrethe?
Yes. Why do you ask?
She died.
-What do you mean? -I read the obituary in the newspaper.
I noticed that she was a clergyman's widow.
"Our dear mother, Kristine Margrethe Sidenius
has found eternal peace." It's signed "her children."
-Did you know she was on her deathbed? -I knew she was sickly.
But I didn't know it was that serious.
To think what a life she led.
With so many children and such a difficult husband.
And in poverty.
And yet, she never complained. I remember you telling me she once said:
"Don't pity me. Pity my husband and my children."
That which is gone, is gone.
Let's talk about something else. Let's talk about you.
Let's go travelling. Soon.
To England. Just you and me.
Let's call it an engagement trip.
There, we can live only for our love. And comfortably plan our wedding.
I have big news myself, which I look forward to telling you.
Go with me to the country house. Don't be alone tonight.
The guest room is ready for you.
We should both tell Mother and Father of your mother's death.
-We owe them that. -Now that we're almost related.
I owe them nothing, apart from the money, of course.
That's not what I meant. They've never mentioned the money.
It's something I've thought about.
I want to be rid of my debt and become independent.
Not from you, but from your family's money.
If the money's not a problem to them, it shouldn't be to you.
No, but I don't want to be indebted to your family.
Hello. I'm here to see senior clerk Sidenius.
First floor, fourth door on the right.
Thank you.
Come in!
I saw in the paper that Mother died.
Yes. I thought you were abroad.
How did she die?
Signe went to her room in the morning to comb her hair.
Mother was quite impatient and asked Signe to hurry up.
Then Mother closed her eyes and passed away peacefully.
She wrote a farewell letter to each of us siblings.
There's one for you as well.
Along with a parcel.
She will, of course, be buried next to Father in Jutland.
Her body will be transported there by ship tomorrow afternoon.
Prior to the funeral, we're convening for a family ceremony by the coffin.
Now that we know you're in town, we'd be sorry if you missed it.
For several reasons, it's probably best that I stay away.
I'm sure my fiancée would like to attend but she would probably be out of place.
-Nor would she be welcome. -You're right.
Peter Andreas?
Due to official duties
I'm prevented from accompanying Mother on her final journey.
I was hoping you'd be able to ignore your own obstinacy this once
and pay Mother your last respects by accompanying the coffin across the sea.
I think you know my answer.
For my son, Peter Andreas, in the blessed name of Our Lord Jesus Christ.
I write to you, my son, in order to try one last time before I close my eyes
to speak to your heart.
I know you don't follow the ways of God. But it's my sincere hope
I know you don't follow the ways of God. But it's my sincere hope that you will show your fellow men humility and selfless love.
that you will show your fellow men humility and selfless love.
May I have a pen and some paper, please?
From earth to earth...
...ashes to ashes...
...dust to dust.
-What a nice surprise. -I needed a bit of fresh air.
After my mother's funeral, I needed some breathing space.
I couldn't think of anywhere more beautiful than this area.
-How long will you be staying? -A couple of days, before I go back.
Duty calls.
I just came here to thank the reverend for his words at the funeral.
Not at all. Your mother was an unusually modest and conscientious person
to God and her next of kin. That's how one remembers her.
I cannot claim to have known your parents. I met them a few times.
We were almost neighbours.
Reverend Sidenius' and my understanding of the function of the Church were very different.
But I respect him. He was an officious man.
How does it feel to be back?
I've come with mixed emotions. I almost fled the area.
But seeing these surroundings again has made an impression.
It's overwhelming.
It's overwhelming. One can gather much wisdom from nature.
We read in the newspaper about your engagement in Copenhagen.
-Sidenius is not a common name. -I see.
I believe your future father-in-law is a very wealthy and influential man?
You're marrying into money.
Nice way to escape your duty to support your wife.
Father!
At no point has money come into it.
Besides, as an engineer I will make enough money to support a family.
This wedding, and I ask from a purely professional point of view...
A Jewish woman and the son of a clergyman, how do you...?
A Jewish woman and the son of a clergyman, how do you...? You're overstepping your mark. Stop questioning our visitor.
Would you like to try our home-made cake? Inger made it.
Don't be shy. There's no need to be modest.
Help yourself.
Well...
Thank you.
Jakobe, do you know when Per will return from Jutland?
He sent a short telegram, and then he was gone.
So you have no idea when we'll be seeing him again?
After the funeral, I assume.
After the funeral, I assume. We need to discuss certain principles and financial issues before the wedding.
Of course, Father.
You have no idea how much I enjoy having left the city.
I assure you that life there can be complicated.
Whereas here... Have you ever been to Copenhagen?
No, never, but I should like to experience a big city.
And see all those classy people that you know.
Let me take your gloves.
I have no doubt that your fiancée is not only rich, but also beautiful.
I'm sorry, I seem to have startled you.
-Have you come back? -I had some errands. And...
-Have you come back? -I had some errands. And... I found your gloves in my pocket.
-Here you are. -Thank you.
I've looked for them everywhere. Would you like to go for a stroll?
Yes.
...and the lock will ensure the correct depth of water...
...so that sea-going ships can pass...
-You're bored. -Not at all.
-You seem so serious all of a sudden. -I do?
Hopefully, you're not missing your fiancée too much?
No, not at all. It's because I'm back here.
Away from it all. I almost feel homesick. A feeling of happiness.
Away from it all. I almost feel homesick. A feeling of happiness. -Are you not happy in Copenhagen? -Yes.
-Are you not happy in Copenhagen? -Yes. Everything that I've worked hard for... And I've worked very hard.
Everything that I've worked hard for... And I've worked very hard. It has become my misfortune.
It has become my misfortune.
Well... I'd better get back.
Can't sleep?
Good morning, Reverend. Unfortunately not.
-Is it body or soul? -My soul.
-Shut out or shut in? -Both, I fear.
Come, Mr. Sidenius. Let's walk. Tell me.
More than anything, I feel trapped.
I can't sleep because I have so many thoughts.
I'm confused. I'm tense.
Is this a test?
Is this a punishment? The punishment for my life.
Is it God's judgement of my life? Is that why I feel so restless?
Or is it homesickness?
Or is it my father's curse that makes me so unsettled? Mr. Sidenius... Don't ruin yourself with destructive thoughts.
Mr. Sidenius... Don't ruin yourself with destructive thoughts.
You're your own enemy and gaoler.
Step outside your prison. Don't be afraid. God is with you.
Please, bless me!
Forgive me for forsaking Mother and Father!
And for forsaking Ivan. And Jakobe. I don't want to do harm anymore.
-Not like this. Stand up. -I deserve the punishment.
Humility is Heaven's price for providing peace of the soul.
You have taken the first step on the path to awareness and humility.
Stay here for a while when I leave.
Cry if you feel like it.
I shall leave you now.
Mr. Sidenius, is that you?
Father and Mother are on a visit, but they'll be back shortly.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
You're engaged to be married.
Don't you understand?
You want to be mine.
It's lovely that you're back from Jutland. I missed you so much.
I tried to persuade Mother and Father to return early from the country house.
I wanted to be here when you came back.
But you know how Father enjoys spending time away from the city.
-Will you go there with me tonight? -Yes.
This is where my bridal dress is being made.
And that's all I'm telling. It will be simple and elegant.
I picked up the tickets to England.
First, we'll take the train to Esbjerg and then get on the boat to Harwich.
And then it'll be just me and you. Our engagement trip. I can't wait.
Aren't you excited about my big news?
You look so serious. Are you still thinking about your mother's funeral?
Yes, of course, but Jakobe...
We need to talk. If it's about the wedding, Father wants you to get in touch as soon as possible.
If it's about the wedding, Father wants you to get in touch as soon as possible.
He wants to meet with you and the solicitor.
Thank you.
No, it's more serious than that.
Jakobe... You're the most perfect person I've ever met.
You've meant so much to me. No one has meant more to me.
But we're facing a huge decision.
Lately, I've been thinking...
I've been thinking whether...
Whether we belong together.
And whether we've ever belonged together.
Perhaps the whole thing was just a notion on my part.
-On your part? -Yes.
Yes. Maybe it was all a mistake, because I insisted too hard.
And lately, I've been thinking that perhaps we're too different.
And that perhaps we'd never be truly happy together.
In the long run.
You don't think we could?
I have my doubts.
So it's probably for the best
that we end it now, before any harm has come to anyone.
So you break off the engagement?
I'm very sorry, Jakobe.
How can you speak of...
How can you speak of our relationship as something which only existed
How can you speak of our relationship as something which only existed because you wanted it to? As if I never loved you?
because you wanted it to? As if I never loved you?
Don't you understand that I almost perished with love
and longing for you?
Perhaps you don't understand what it means to love another person.
Maybe you only know the unfavourable side of passion.
Self-absorption and conceitedness.
You see, we're too different.
Right?
Why don't you just come out with it?
I beseech you, at least be honest.
Is there someone else?
You're just pointing out that we're too different.
Tell me the truth!
I would respect you if you'd just be honest this one time.
Just admit that you're in love with someone else!
I guess that's the Sidenius family's trait.
That your inner, stunted emotions need to be so solemn. Good Lord!
They only cover up your vanity.
Your immaturity.
I understand that you're angry, Jakobe. I really do understand.
And I'm sorry it had to end this way. I really am.
At least I won't have to take your barbaric name.
Please tell your father that I intend to repay every penny
of the money he lent me.
With compound interest.
Anna? Please have these delivered to Mr. Sidenius.
Yes, Miss Salomon.
Please insert this advertisement in the Berlingske Gazette.
"Philip Salomon and his wife regret to announce
that the engagement of their daughter Jakobe
to Mr. Sidenius has been called off."
-Is this a joke? -No, unfortunately not.
Why wasn't I told?
We were never particularly taken by this...
What about his project? Our investment! He signed a contract which clearly outlined the conditions of repayment.
He signed a contract which clearly outlined the conditions of repayment.
As security for the loan, I'd give you the patent for my invention.
I'd appreciate it if the money was paid out as soon as possible.
I don't know the value of your machines. My decision is influenced by the fact that I've recently learned
My decision is influenced by the fact that I've recently learned
that your engagement to Miss Salomon has been called off.
That's why I suggested...
On principle, we as a business never get involved in anything
if we can't get a bank security.
So unfortunately, Mr. Sidenius, we're unable to grant you a loan.
Mother?
Yes, child.
Remember, I talked about visiting my friend Rebekka in Breslau?
-Yes. -I think I'd like to do that now.
But I don't have enough money for the journey. Will you ask Father for help?
-When will you be leaving? -As soon as possible.
-When will you be leaving? -As soon as possible. Perhaps tomorrow.
So that's why it's been so hard to reach you.
Has it? I apologise.
Does anyone know? Not even your sister or Ivan?
Only Rebekka knows. She knows a good doctor.
Don't trouble Father with this. I'll get you the money for everything.
And make sure to rest afterwards.
If anyone asks, we'll say you needed to get away, after Per broke it off.
How do you expect to carry out the project now? Without Salomon?
Without the banking sector and the manufacturing sector's man?
And what about Bjerregrav? You're mad.
-How about a small loan? -And what would you need that for?
I owe Salomon money, and I'm getting married in Jutland.
I won't lend you any money.
When I heard you were no longer Philip Salomon's son-in-law
it made no sense to me.
How can an ambitious young man like you renounce such an opportunity?
It still doesn't make sense to me.
Jakobe?
Jakobe?
First, I'd like to make the apology I owe you. I apologise, sir.
You see, I currently find myself in straitened circumstances.
I ask for your kind understanding.
I was hoping you might once again consider my project
under your skilful supervision in order to introduce it to affluent investors
who might advance me the money.
I'm afraid it's too late, Mr. Sidenius. Thank you for coming.
You may remember me from the time when I was poor. How times do change.
You see, I'm getting married to a wealthy baroness from Jutland.
Since I'm leaving the city, I might as well get rid of these things.
You will notice that the suits are made from the finest Italian wool.
I'll give you three kroner.
The bust is part of the bargain. It's made by one of Germany's finest...
I can't sell it. And the books are in German. Nobody buys German books.
-But... You can have the drawings too. -I can't sell used paper.
No... And the way to God is the way of trial.
I have no idea what you're babbling about. Three kroner.
I have no idea what you're babbling about. Three kroner. Do you know who I am? No you don't, but let me enlighten you.
A son of God. A genius!
All that are bred and born in darkness will one day appear
and sentence shall be passed upon them. Keep your money!
But beware! Beware His intrepid curse!
Young Mr. Sidenius?
It's been a long time. Is there anything I can do for you?
Would you ask Jakobe to come down here?
She's gone out of town, and will be away for some time.
Look at the state of you!
Do you remember our first conversation?
Fortune favours fools, and success is the father of regret.
Well... Pride goes before a fall.
There you go.
That looks fine. Hagbart?
Stand still. Straighten your back.
That looks fine. Nails!
The other hand.
-And keep your back straight! -Lift your arms.
Receive the Apostolic blessing.
May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
-Hello, Jakobe. -Eybert. It's been a long time.
-Hello, Jakobe. -Eybert. It's been a long time. Indeed.
-You've been out of town. -We've opened an office in Germany.
So the girls are now fluent in German. They send their love.
Give them my love.
I apologise if I'm imposing on you...
But I want you to know that I've put all the disappointments behind me.
Time heals all wounds, as they say. All is forgiven.
I want to ask you, now that everything's changed
if you'd like to, when it's convenient for you, of course
let me take you to the tearoom?
Or to dinner. You and me.
Dear Eybert.
You've always been so good and considerate to me.
Can we try again, Jakobe?
I'm sure you would have been the most loving husband to me.
But we would never be happy. You see, I don't love you.
Damn, another disruption!
First of all, Per, how is your project for the future going?
I'm just finishing up a project for the new port of Esbjerg.
It will be the centre, or rather the junction, for European shipping traffic.
-There'll be docks, shipyards and... -And how will you accomplish that?
Well, the authorities are neither to be led nor driven...
I understand.
And when you're not working on your vision for the future?
As you know, I'm helping out around the house.
Other than that, I spend time contemplating.
The fact of the matter is, Per
that a small home like yours and Inger's with three children
involves expenses, right? Your bills are not being paid.
I'm mentioning it because I can't keep supporting you on my modest wages.
I'm here to work out a solution.
It's obvious that you're having money problems.
I insist on not having any tutelage.
I insist on not having any tutelage. I strongly ask you not to speak to me in that manner.
I'm here to work out a solution to your family responsibilities.
Listen, Per. Yesterday, I met the young, rich landowner, Mr. Brück.
He's heard of your engineering skills.
He needs some water regulation for the streams on his estate this spring.
I suggested he contact you.
-W... w... welcome, Mr. Sidenius. -Thank you.
My wife Inger. I believe you two already know each other.
Yes, s... s... since childhood.
-Welcome, Inger. -Thank you.
It's nice to be back here.
-Shall we walk? -Yes. If you'll help carry this.
A simple drainage system must be a m... m... mere trifle for an engineer such as yourself.
a m... m... mere trifle for an engineer such as yourself.
On the contrary. I'm happy to help out.
D... d... do you see possibilities, Mr. Sidenius?
Yes, absolutely. With a few changes to the bed of the stream
we can lower the ground-water level, so the soil can be used as arable land.
It requires some powerful pumps by the barrage.
They could be driven by mills. One per pumping station.
I'd forgotten that the meadow extends all the way to the lake.
Would you mind if I brought the children here, Mr. Brück?
No, of... of course. They can s... s... swim and f... fish as much as they like.
The rowing boats are there for that purpose.
Have you been here all day?
Are you cold?
I like your braids.
Did you do them yourself?
-Can I help? -Yes, you can give the children bread.
-Excuse me, who are you? -I was just passing by.
-Excuse me, who are you? -I was just passing by. -My name is Jakobe Salomon. -Do you know where you are?
-My name is Jakobe Salomon. -Do you know where you are?
-My name is Jakobe Salomon. -Do you know where you are? This is the YWCA.
I'm sure you understand why we can't have people of your faith here.
I'm sure you understand why we can't have people of your faith here. -My faith? -The YWCA is a Christian movement.
-My faith? -The YWCA is a Christian movement.
I understand. I'm sorry.
This is what makes it turn with the wind.
When the wind hits it, the sails rotate like this.
That creates electricity, which creates a current.
Do you understand? Right there.
No!
You broke it! Get down! Don't be so clumsy! And apologise to Father.
Get down! Don't be so clumsy! And apologise to Father.
Apologise to Father!
Apologise to Father, Hagbart.
Hagbart! You come back and apologise to Father!
-Are the children asleep? -Ingeborg and Lise are fast asleep.
Hagbart complains of a stomach ache.
I'm sure he'll go to sleep soon.
Please, will you not speak so harshly to him?
He's a sensitive boy.
Sure.
He's a clever little boy who misses his father.
-Are you coming to bed? -When I've read the paper.
-Goodnight, dear. -Goodnight.
I know I've disappointed you by not getting married and having children.
Instead, in accordance with our family tradition, I want to help the needy.
So I've decided to found a charity school here in Copenhagen.
I know it will cost me my whole inheritance.
But since I have no one to leave it to
I can't think of a more meaningful way of spending it.
-Miss Salomon, we're ready. -Gather round, children! Come here.
You need to face this way.
And move that way a little. I think we're ready.
-Look at that handsome gentleman. -Look into the box.
And stand completely still. One, two, three... Thank you!
Our children hardly ever see their parents. They work all day.
Normal schools are so wretched, they seem more like penal institutions.
Children in need are brutalised by police who send them to the poorhouse.
And the one person who could teach them wisdom the vicar, speaks only of doomsday and hell.
the vicar, speaks only of doomsday and hell.
So how will these children ever learn to love their neighbours
and become decent human beings?
Little by little, I want to turn the school into an alternative school.
A place of refuge, a sanctuary.
I have personally observed how a bad childhood can scar a person.
I wanted to create a place, which can help break the social inheritance.
Come in, Hagbart.
Mother told me to say goodnight to you.
Yes. Come in.
I made this because I broke the other mill.
Thank you.
You're not afraid of Father, are you?
You and I will work it out.
Do you want me to leave?
Why do you ask?
You seem as if you'd rather be on your own.
I know you're having a hard time. Can't you speak to my father?
Maybe he can help you find solace in God.
Wherever I've searched for Him, I've only found myself.
God is superfluous to he who has found himself.
What's wrong, Per?
There are people who are drawn to disaster.
People who can only find emancipation in hopelessness and solitude.
What are you saying?
I sometimes think it would be better for you and the children if I weren't here.
You must promise me not to be dragged down with me.
-There's the birthday boy! -You look very dapper.
-Happy birthday, Hagbart. -Bow and say thank you, Hagbart.
-Hello, Mr. Brück. -Hello.
-H... h... happy birthday, Hagbart. -Bow and say thank you.
-Thank you for in... in... inviting me. -We're glad you could make it.
Come in.
-Here comes the birthday cake! -Happy birthday, Hagbart.
Can you help yourself? Maybe Brück can help you.
I've launched the boat.
Perhaps you'd like to come and try it out, Hagbart?
It'll make for a nice afternoon. -A large piece for you. -Pass along the plates.
-A large piece for you. -Pass along the plates.
Here's to a happy birthday. And thank you all for coming.
Happy birthday, Hagbart.
He must have been a good boy all year to get such a sunny day.
His behaviour has been exemplary.
His behaviour has been exemplary. I need to leave. I forgot to tell the people at the lock something.
I forgot to tell the people at the lock something. Do you have to do that right now? It's Hagbart's birthday.
Do you have to do that right now? It's Hagbart's birthday.
I'll be back soon.
Are you satisfied now?
JAKOBE SALOMON HAS OPENED CHARITY SCHOOL IN COPENHAGEN.
Miss Salomon?
-I have a letter for you. -Thank you.
You came after all.
It's been such a long time.
So this is how you live. Here, in the wilderness.
I've felt alienated
and rootless all my life.
But out here, I've finally become conscious of who I am.
In my ungodly solitude.
Without it, I would merely have been half a human being.
A Sidenius always.
So now I feel liberated.
I've followed you from a distance.
I knew you were ill, but not that it was this serious.
It's cancer. The doctor says I don't have long to live.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Tell me about Copenhagen.
We speak of you often.
Despite the racket back then, Father and Ivan agree that you did the right thing.
One day, I'm sure the world will realise the grandeur
and necessity in your national works.
That's something I wanted to ask you...
Will you display my project and my model at your school?
As a kind of inspiration to the children.
Yes, of course. Of course that's where it should be.
The real reason I wrote and asked you to come...
I wanted to give you this.
It's my last will. Your school is the sole beneficiary.
It's 12,600 kroner.
It's not a lot, but it's what I've been able to save up through the years.
And I wanted to ask...
...if you find yourself able to receive this gift.
Why shouldn't I?
Even though you and I are very different...
...I'm not sure I ever really understood you.
But that makes me even more grateful for this gift.
Did I hurt you deeply?
I wouldn't change a thing about my life.
On the contrary, I feel very happy to have known you.
Only with the joy and sorrow which you caused, did my life gain meaning.
The school which I've created, is as much your work as it is mine.
Fair and very cold.
This morning, ice in our bedroom for the first time all winter.
The water froze on the potatoes as soon as they were washed.
With little pride and less hope, we begin the new year.
On the porch after sunup,
I could hear the low chirping of sparrows in the hedgerows
I could hear the low chirping of sparrows in the hedgerows that are now buried in the snow.
Dyer has maintained that with good health and a level head,
there is always an excellent chance for a farmer willing to work.
He feels he can never fully rid himself of his burdens.
And I'm certain that because his mind is in such a bad state,
it affects his whole system.
He told me this morning that contentment was like a friend he never gets to see.
-You're late with the milking. -She wasn't suffering.
And you?
[Abigail] Since our acquisition of this farm,
my husband has kept a ledger to help him see the year whole.
This way, he knows what each crop and field pays from year to year.
And Dyer has asked me to keep a list in a diary
of matters that might otherwise go overlooked.
From tools lent out to bills outstanding.
That I have done.
But there would be no record in these dull and simple pages
of the most passionate circumstances of our seasons past.
No record of our emotions or fears,
our greatest joys or most piercing sorrows.
With our child,
it was as if I'd found my bearings.
But I too rarely told her that she was our treasure.
Would you like to try?
Like this, Papa?
That's it.
[Abigail] She often seemed separate from us,
as if she was working at just fitting in where she could.
"They saw his brothers and sister. And it was the mouse's family."
[Abigail] There is something so affecting
about mute and motionless grief and illness in a child so young.
She put her arms around me and said nothing else.
But it felt like we were speaking.
[Abigail] I have become my grief.
I have become my grief.
[Abigail] "Welcome, sweet day of rest," says the hymn.
And Sunday is most welcome for its few hours of quiet ease.
As for me,
I no longer attend.
After the calamity of Nellie's loss,
what calm I enjoy does not derive from the notion of a better world to come.
[Abigail] I want to purchase an atlas.
[Finney] Jacob, may I offer you a ride?
-[Jacob] It wouldn't be a bother? -[Finney] No, no, no bother.
Up.
Who is that?
[Dyer] His name is Finney.
His wife Tallie.
Met them at the feed store. They seem to keep to themselves.
They're renting the Zebrun farm.
[Abigail] Monday, February 4th.
Why is ink like fire?
Because it is a good servant and a hard master.
Did you say something?
I want to purchase an atlas.
I suppose there are more frivolous purchases one could make.
I've saved 90 cents of my own. I can't imagine a better way to spend it.
Could buy your husband a gift.
What better gift could I give him than a wife who is no longer a dullard?
My self-education seems the only way
to keep my unhappiness from overwhelming me.
Easy, girl, easy.
Good afternoon.
I've been using a broom on my porch. The snow is so dry.
I'm Tallie.
Abigail.
-I hope I'm not intruding. -No.
I needed to get away for the day.
Our farm is a slaughterhouse right now. My husband is killing his hogs.
Would you like to come in?
Yes, I'd love that.
Or we could just stay out on the porch, shivering.
I know it's the dullest of all things to have an ignorant neighbor come by
and spoil a Sunday afternoon.
Oh, no, you're most welcome here. But I know the feeling.
Sometimes I imagine during Widow Weldon's visits
that I've been plunged up to my eyes in a vat of the prosaic.
Widow Weldon. She got going on a county levy once...
[Abigail] She saw I had noticed her hair
and admitted she had been vain about it as a girl.
She said that back then, she'd worn it longer
and plaited in a bun at the back of her head.
In the winter sun through the window,
her skin had an under-flush of rose and violet
which so disconcerted me that I had to look away.
As always,
when it came to speaking and attempting to engage another's affections,
circumstances doomed me to striving and anxiety.
From my earliest youth, I was like a pot-bound root,
all curled in upon itself.
I hope I'm not keeping you from something.
No.
I'm glad you've come.
Finney saw your husband at the cooperage.
He mentioned his new method for farrowing his piglets.
With some asperity?
My husband mentions everything with some asperity.
I told him that once,
and he observed in response
that it seemed to be quite a favor to get a kind word from me.
And I told him that if he was married to himself,
he'd soon find out what a favor it was.
My mother always said that having children would resolve that dilemma.
My mother made the same claim.
And yet...
here we are...
both childless.
My daughter Nellie would have been 5 today.
Oh, God.
How did she pass?
Diphtheria. Last September.
God, I'm so sorry.
-Hello. -Oh.
Good afternoon.
I'm Dyer.
Tallie.
Well, it's late, isn't it? I should be getting on.
-Don't go on my account. -[Tallie] Oh, no.
-[Dyer] That's a nice wrap you have. -Thank you.
I never receive compliments for my clothes.
I'm so glad you've come. Meeting you has made my day.
It has?
Well, how pleasant and uncommon it is to make someone's day.
[Abigail] Thursday, February 14th.
Dyer's third night with a fever.
Drink this.
I plan on getting sick more often.
My wife smiles at me.
Promise me you're not gonna die.
That would be the opposite of my intention.
[Abigail] I've restored him somewhat with an enema of molasses, warm water and lard.
Also a drop of turpentine next to his nose.
I spent the day reconsidering my conversation with Tallie.
-We compared childhood beds, -[Dyer coughing]
mine in which the straw was always breaking up and thinning out,
and hers, which was as hard, she claimed, as the pharaoh's heart.
I should be taking care of you.
I agree.
[Abigail] Her manner is sweet, and calm and gracious.
And yet her spirit seemed to quicken
at the prospect of further conversation with me.
I find that everything I wish to tell her loses its eloquence in her presence.
So how did you come to meet Dyer?
He was the oldest son of a neighbor. He helped out on my father's farm.
And was he instantly smitten by you?
He was, wasn't he? He was instantly smitten by you.
He admired what he viewed as my practical good sense.
You don't countenance words like "smitten," do you?
I suspect I use all the same words you do.
I suspect you don't.
In speech, yes, because you're shy.
But I bet you're more accomplished in your writing.
Thank you.
Your good sense, that's all your husband was smitten with?
And my efficient habits.
That's all?
My handy ways.
Dyer likes mechanical things.
I have no doubt he would've been happier
had he been allowed to pursue the natural scientific bent of his mind.
Circumstances forced him into farming.
And despite all of that, his heart compelled him to you?
Well, you would have to ask him about that.
And what would you say if I asked you?
I suppose that as a suitor, he was
not generous, but he was just.
And that he was affectionate, if not constant.
I wasn't sure of his suitability.
But my family felt that more improving might be in the offing.
After all, it is a long lane that has no turning.
You both have much to be thankful for.
We do.
It's still too soon.
Sorry.
Tuesday, February 19th.
My reluctance seems to have become his shame.
His nighttime pleasures, which were never numerous,
have curtailed even more.
And I have so far refused to engage his persistence
on the subject of another child.
[Finney] Evening.
[Tallie] This is my husband, Finney. You already know Dyer?
Our paths have crossed.
-This is the Abigail I've been mentioning. -Evening.
My wife talks about you as if you're all about the house.
-Everything reminds her of you. -Well, it's all I can do
but sit cross-legged and morose whenever she's away.
-Come in. -Thank you.
[Dyer] It's rained so heavy that it broke down our mill.
Did you miss me?
Yes.
You look different.
No.
Finney seems agreeable.
Yes, he is when he chooses to be.
[Finney] I guess I'm supposed to offer a toast.
But when it comes to the social graces,
I'm about as smooth as coming down a rocky hill in the dark.
What my husband means is he's so happy to finally get together
and to see Dyer again.
Thanks.
Part of what I value about my wife
is how she's taught me to associate with my fellow beings.
Finney, that's a handsome necktie you've chosen.
Thank you. But with my neck,
my head sticks out like a chicken in a poultry wagon.
-Your tart was wonderful. -Did you like it?
I'm so glad.
I was worried I wouldn't have enough eggs because we had an accident.
-Oh. -[Finney] Mm. My hired hand pulled down a box of eggs and broke two dozen.
And I announced that he was unlucky to eggs
and no longer allowed to approach them.
[Abigail] "Unlucky to eggs." I like that.
I told him that his shirt had so many holes, he can make a necklace of it.
Well, we often wish we could afford a hired hand.
Mm. We've suffered from the carelessness of hired hands.
Mr. Holt's hired hand is said to have swum his horse
over the canal despite the cold. Really?
Yes.
[Dyer] Winter's been so hard.
Sometimes Mrs. Weldon's son has had to deliver the mail on skis.
Now our letters can get lost at breakneck speed.
Did you write letters to Tallie when you were courting?
[Finney] I did.
And did Tallie keep them?
Only Tallie knows for sure.
[Abigail] Monday, February 25th.
Finney and Tallie's bond confounds me.
At times, when their eyes meet,
they seem yoked in opposition to one another.
While at other times, there seems a shared regard.
There is something going on between us that I cannot unravel.
Hold this here.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hello, Dyer.
Well, hello.
You off?
Yes, to town.
Have a good day.
She'll be pleased to see you.
Happy birthday.
-I brought you some things. -What?
Hand-knitted?
-I hoped you'd like them. -I do.
An atlas...
of the United States of America.
And a little pot of applesauce with an egg on top.
-My feet are freezing. -Let me warm them?
How's Finney?
He's Finney.
Uh, it tickles.
My husband records trespassers in his journals.
And this morning, when I asked him what he intends to do about them,
his response was so unpleasant that I resolved to visit you.
So that there would be something in my day other than his meanness.
Dyer thinks he has many estimable qualities.
He does, and he also uses a ledger
to keep accounting of whom I visit and how long I stay.
Why?
I have no idea. As he's gotten more like this,
I've given up trying to figure out all the peculiarities
of his... odd little world.
I suppose he's especially unhappy with me since...
I'm yet to give him a child.
What does it feel like?
Like nothing at first.
But then when she began to stir,
it's like butterflies flapping their wings.
Later, like a rabbit as she kicked her legs at night.
It frightens me.
The thought of having none of that.
And of giving birth.
Most of us feel that way.
But...
when the time comes, I will be there to guide you through it.
Dyer must want another child.
I understand.
Birthday gifts.
A box of raisins...
that needle case you've been needing and a tin of sardines.
You spoil me.
You got gifts from your new friend.
She left hours ago.
I just saw her leave.
[Abigail] The great storm began with a faint groaning in the northeast.
It was like the noise of a locomotive.
[Tallie] Halt, mare, halt!
Halt!
Stay there!
[man] Come closer, girl.
It's warmer over here.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll be going.
[man] You should wait it out.
Come on, mare.
Dyer!
Dyer!
Dyer!
[Abigail] How long would it be before I received word of Tallie?
How long could I wait?
How long will the feed in the barn last?
Each cow eats 26 pounds of forage every day.
You should know that.
They'll start to skinny down after three days.
Heard the newspaper predicts the storm will let up by then.
But that's probably based on an expert's consultation of a goose bone.
In a real crisis of nature, we're all at another's mercy.
Yes.
My mother liked to say, "We tumbled from one mortification to another."
When I was 7, an earthquake knocked down our house and barn.
Did I tell you?
Never.
-An earthquake? -Yes.
I remember something woke me before dawn, I don't know what.
My father was calling out.
But I couldn't tear myself away from the window.
I saw birds fluttering in the air, afraid to set down.
And the river was roiling, and I couldn't move.
And then...
finally, I jumped down through our collapsed stairwell...
as all my brothers had done before me.
And we huddled together in the dark on the porch.
Later, my mother said that the dread never fully went away after that.
She said, "What was safe if the solid earth could do that?"
My mother.
Tallie! You're frozen.
Tallie, stay awake. Stay awake.
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.
Keep your eyes open.
Keep your eyes open.
Look at me. Look.
I would die without you.
Then you're safe...
because I am here.
[Abigail] Monday, March 17th.
Half the chickens are lost.
I dug ice and snow from their dead, open mouths
in an attempt to revive them.
Hobnails...
for better traction.
[Abigail] The Widow Weldon's son, on his rounds, reported
that Tallie had gotten home safely, with, he thought, only a little frostbite.
We haven't seen your friend down the lane for a while.
Mm. Finney took her to Oneonta.
And so everything is tedious and lonesome?
[Abigail] Thursday, April 10th.
Biscuits and dried mackerel for breakfast.
Dyer has augmented the padding in the cattle pens
with his hoardings of maple leaves and old straw.
It always seems that Tallie will never appear.
But I remind myself
that time and the needle wear through the longest morning.
And I have noted that when she does arrive,
my heart is like a leaf borne over a rock by rapidly moving water.
Hello. Oh!
Careful.
Stay. Sit, sit.
[Abigail] Saturday, April 12th.
I spent the last two days...
[Abigail] Very damp, cloudy and cool.
Smoky.
Perhaps the forest is somewhere on fire.
Your nose is being gracious.
[Abigail] Monday, April 14th.
A terribly bad spring so far,
but the clover has come up through it and is all right.
And how's Finney?
The soul of patience.
He's mentioning again the idea of migrating west.
You're planning on moving west?
Perhaps.
I had an uncle who moved to Ohio and came to a desperate end.
Which is what one might expect from Ohio.
Tomorrow?
Okay.
[Abigail] Thursday, April 17th.
Rain in torrents nearly all night.
The lane is flooded and the ditches brim full.
This morning, only a slight shower.
Tallie came later than her usual time today.
She offered no explanation.
I'm sorry that your childhood was anything less than joyous.
Joyous it was not.
But I made my own happinesses.
My husband says, "God puts heavy stones in your path.
It's up to us to step over them."
Stones are what the fortunate receive.
My mother's mother was born in 1780 right here in Schoharie County.
I often wonder at the courage and resourcefulness of those women.
Imagine faring forth into a wilderness,
hoping to build the foundations of a home.
Maybe they had a certain high hopefulness that we don't have.
When can you come?
Tuesday.
-[Dyer] Hello, Tallie. -Good day.
Your afternoon gladsome?
Yes, it was, very.
-Goodbye. -Bye.
[Abigail] I felt, looking at her expression,
as if she were in full sail on a flood tide
while I bobbed along down backwards.
And yet,
I never saw on her countenance the indifference of the fortunate
towards the less fortunate.
-[Tallie] Good day. -Good day.
Are you sick too?
Not at all.
I was hoping to compare colds.
I'll make you tea and honey.
What?
Every morning, I wake up and I think that I never want to be far from you.
And under your influence, since you're so good with words,
I've composed a poem.
It's entitled:
"Oh, Sick and Miserable Heart, Be Still."
When I was a little girl,
I thought I could cultivate my intellect and do something for the world.
But my life has surprised me by being far more ordinary.
You're talking about that moment that I have dreamed about,
when we're carried in triumph for having done something wonderful
or received at home with tears and shouts of joy.
Do you know what I wonder?
Is it possible that such a moment hasn't yet come for either of us?
I think it has.
Or that it could.
You do?
So, what do you think?
What do you think about us?
-I don't know how to put it into words. -Well, try.
-I have tried. -Well, try again. What do you imagine?
I imagine that I love how our encircling feelings leave nothing out...
for us to want or seek.
I've presumed too much.
[whispering] It's been my experience
that it's not always those who show the least who actually feel... the least.
[in normal voice] It's my dog's toenails on the wood.
Why didn't you do what you attempted to do?
I worry you'll catch my cold.
You smell like a biscuit.
I have to go home.
[Abigail] Astonishment and joy.
Astonishment and joy.
Astonishment and joy.
You haven't accomplished any of your responsibilities.
-Do you need assistance? -No, I don't think so.
So it's a cold plate for supper tonight?
I'll milk the cows.
[Abigail] Friday, May 30th.
The sunshine streaming through the branches
makes a tremendous farrago of light and shade.
We hold our friendship between us and study it...
as if it were the incomplete map of our escape.
When the day is done,
my mind turns to her and I think, with a special heat:
"Why are we to be separated?"
Your smile stopped. Is it meant for someone else?
Sorry, my mind was elsewhere.
We need calico, and buttons and shoe thread.
Am I troubling you, sitting here with you like this?
Not at all.
I may be late coming to it, but I've learned consideration of others.
I've learned the need for human sympathy...
by the unfulfilled want of it.
I feel I've provided you with sympathy.
I suppose that's so.
Her smile returns.
[Tallie] Good day.
I believe that intimacy increases goodwill.
And if that's the case,
then every minute we spend together will make us more cheerful workers.
Won't our farms benefit from that?
Won't our husbands?
All our burdens will be lightened.
[Abigail] When she left, I was like a skiff at sea
with neither hand nor helm to guide it.
They're cleaning out the drain under the street along the fork.
And several people are down with fever.
[Finney] Holt came by to hang the bacon.
He still hasn't recovered from being beaten by two strangers.
He had to be hauled to his home in his cart.
He said the men who did it were gonna kill him,
but then realized they were mistaken as to who he was.
Lately, it seems like all you talk about are highwaymen and housebreakers.
On the contrary.
I often defer to your sensitivities.
I haven't even told you about all the reports in the county
of men who have poisoned and killed their wives
because I haven't found it a fitting subject for supper.
[Abigail] "Killed their wives." He used those words?
[Abigail] "Killed their wives." He used those words? [Tallie] Mm-hm. Those words.
Have you had many disagreements?
Yes, about my wifely duties.
I told him that I was opposed to it, that I was not willing.
And he accepted that?
Well, he hasn't touched me since, so...
But I made myself feel better by composing a poem.
Can I read you the opening stanza?
You can read me the entire poem.
No, I'll start with the opening stanza.
I love flowering gardens I love creeping plants
I love walking in the air But I fear swarming ants
I don't think I can support the rhyme.
You see why I didn't read the whole thing?
I'm sorry.
I've always been contrary and maladroit.
Earlier, I felt that...
whenever I would draw close to you, you would retreat,
and that if I kept still, you would return, but you'd stay at a distance,
like those sparrows that stay in a farmyard
and won't come into the house.
-That's not how I feel. -How do you feel, then?
When I was in school,
the teacher had me read Cordelia to an older boy's King Lear.
Near the end of the play, the king and his daughter are imprisoned,
but he views it in a positive way.
"Come, let's away to prison," he says.
"We two alone shall sing like birds in a cage."
Imprisoned?
In a positive way?
Well, it may be that one has to read the entire play.
Well, it may be only in plays where people are imprisoned in a positive way.
You don't think there's a cage that could work to our benefit?
I just--
I only know that...
[sighs] I've never liked cages.
I hope you had a good afternoon in Shangri-la or Timbuktu,
wherever it is you've been.
It's been a busy afternoon, yes.
I would think. Five hours you've been gone.
I went to the drapers. I couldn't find anything I liked.
I stopped by the tinker for a sack of coffee,
but he's now asking 60 cents. I only had 50.
And I thought I would buy you a treat of some kind,
but Mr. Arnolds reminded me that I still owed for my last transaction.
So I was forced to close up my purse.
Tell me everything about your day. Don't hold anything back.
You're not interested in how your wife spends her time?
I don't feel I have a wife. I feel I have a selfish whore who--
Who'd rather wander off to another man's house
than contribute any labor.
Well, Dyer was off in the fields,
and their house is on the way back home, so...
So it's just Abigail and you tittering and gossiping away the hours?
Enjoying each other's company.
I have certain expectations and you have certain duties.
We have talked all night and day about your expectations.
I will not stay with a woman if it continually requires contention.
Well, then you shouldn't stay with me, should you?
Don't ask for more than you can handle.
[Abigail] Sunday, June 8th.
All afternoon, a hawk has been using a single cloud above us
as its own parasol.
To ward off others of its kind.
[Abigail] Our whole house now seems both angry and repentant.
God help us.
When three days went by without any word from her,
I stole over to her house to look on her
from what I imagined to be a vantage point of perfect safety.
By turning the lens piece, I could draw her face nearer
and hold it there until she turned away.
Her image provoked a sensation in me
like the violence that sends a floating branch far out
over a waterfall's precipice before it plummets.
[Finney] For the wife does not have the authority over her own body,
but the husband does.
Do not deprive one another, so that Satan may not tempt you
because of your lack of self-control.
Ephesians 5:33.
Submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord--
[Abigail] Monday, June 9th.
[Abigail] Merciful Father...
turn the channel of events.
Wednesday, June 11th.
Dyer has been silent all day, and I was happy to be left to my solitude.
Hello!
Tallie.
We haven't seen you for days.
Have you been ill?
-Nothing serious, I hope. -[Finley] Whoa.
She's been under the weather.
-[Dyer] Good afternoon. -[Tallie] Good afternoon.
We want to invite you to dinner again, this Saturday next.
But it's our turn. We should be feasting you.
In the meantime, please be our guests.
[Dyer] We'd love to.
Six?
[Dyer] Six it is.
[Abigail] My mother once told me, in a fury, when I was a little girl,
that my father asked nothing of her except that she work in the garden,
harvest the produce, preserve the fruit,
tend the poultry, milk the cows, manage the household duties
and help out in the fields when needed.
She said she appeared in his ledger only when she purchased a dress.
Am I anywhere in there?
I'm recording spring expenses.
[Abigail] And how have things changed?
Daughters are married off so young that everywhere you look,
a slender and unwilling girl is being forced to stem a sea of tribulations
before she is even full-grown in height.
That's its purpose!
Come on. Come on.
[Abigail] Morning.
Morning, Jim.
Morning, ma'am. I've got a new book for you.
You know, I'd actually like to see that blue dress you have there.
All right, lady.
It's two and a half.
I'll take it.
My change?
Thank you.
The Mannings' eldest daughter tipped over an oil lamp and it set the house ablaze.
-[woman] Fire! -[Abigail] Ho, ho.
[man] Fire! [Abigail] Before she was driven from the house by the flames,
she heard calls from her sister who was trapped in the upper loft.
[man] Come on!
[woman wailing] No!
[Abigail] Just another minute.
Just another--
[woman] Get her out!
Get her out!
Get her out of there!
Get her out!
Get her out!
No!
Your wife's to be commended on her hospitality and cooking.
I can recall the day...
No, thank you.
when every family was fed, clothed, shod, sheltered
and warmed from the products a good wife gathered within her own fence line.
[Dyer] I heard down by the loggers
Mrs. Manning's oldest got fiercely burned in a house fire.
-Cassie. -[Tallie] And died.
[Abigail] Yes, she did.
Well, as my father used to say:
"The supreme disposer of all events does sometimes disappoint our earthly hopes."
What a marvelous hanging lamp.
Finney purchased it so that everyone could read with equal ease all around the room.
I wasn't brought up to read over much.
But I do believe a father should give his children every chance to improve.
Children being a sore point in this household.
And yours, I'd expect.
You'll have to forgive my husband.
Even so... whatever misfortunes arrive at my doorstep,
I seek to improve my lot with my own industry.
I--
I study my options closely,
and I just attend to everything with more vehemence.
Well, then you should be commended for that.
I'll give you an example.
When I first began farming,
I was so vexed at my own inability to stop my dogs barking
that one January, during a storm,
I held the dog around the corner of the barn in a gale
until it froze to death.
I nearly froze to death myself, at least froze my hands,
even with my heavy work gloves.
That is reprehensible.
[Dyer] Did I see outside that you use an old shovel plow?
Well, since you're interested in my machinery...
I have a hinged harrow that's been giving me trouble.
The spikes catch the rocks and roots, and they break off.
Well, our harrow has upright discs.
Work better?
Yeah, it seems to.
Bring the desserts.
I think we're stuffed.
My husband insists on his pastries and preserved fruits and creams.
Well, good.
What is happening? Are you in danger?
-What happened to your neck? -Oh, I just took a fall over a fence.
I hadn't heard.
Well, there are many things about which you haven't heard.
[Abigail] Back at the table, Tallie kept strict custody of her eyes.
Her husband's mood seemed to have darkened.
He served the pastries and creams himself...
leaving only her plate empty.
Saturday, June 21st.
My heart a maelstrom.
My head a bedlam.
A whole week and no visit from Tallie.
No word.
My anxieties often force me to stop my work
and pace the house like an inmate.
I have to see her.
Tallie!
Tallie!
What has happened?
They're gone.
And no goodbye?
We need to call the sheriff.
And report what exactly? That our neighbors moved?
It's the Zebrun farm. They were renting.
I'll go, then.
For what reason?
There's blood.
And you never had an accident?
So we'll just do nothing?
I'll make the rounds of the neighbors.
And if we're not satisfied, we can take your fears to the sheriff.
Thank you.
[Abigail] Monday, June 23rd.
Dyer said Mrs. Nottoway recalled spotting their caravan on the country road
in the late evening, heading northwest.
[Dyer] Mrs. Nottoway?
[Abigail] She believed she spied Tallie's figure alongside her husband's but was unsure.
A hired hand, she thought, was driving the second wagon.
Sunday, June 29th.
I spotted the sheriff on his way to church.
-Our neighbors, Tallie... -I conveyed my accusations to no response.
Dyer said that no one would investigate a crime
without evidence that a crime had been committed.
Calm myself?
I refused to calm myself, so he tied me to a chair and administered laudanum.
Monday, June 30th.
Bleary and short of breath from the laudanum...
I wake weeping, retire weeping...
stand before my duties weeping.
Sunday, July 6th.
I am a library without books,
a sea of fear, agitation and want.
Dyer speaks of how much we have for which to be grateful.
I sit violently conscious of the ticking clock
while he weeps at what he imagines to be his own poor, forgotten self.
Wednesday, July 9th.
Despite some hours without the laudanum, I was so befogged and wild with grief
that Dyer left me for the afternoon, unsettled and wary of my state.
Tuesday, July 22nd.
Weldon?
-Good day. -The renters at Zebrun's farm are gone.
Did they leave a forwarding address?
No. You've got a letter.
Is it from her?
It is.
Origin?
Onondaga County. Do you know it?
That's north of Syracuse.
You gonna read it?
To myself.
[Tallie] Abigail, Abigail, Abigail.
I'm sorry that all I have to send you is this letter,
and I'm sorry for all that a letter cannot be.
Even the best letter is just a little bit of someone.
I'm sorry I never got to say goodbye.
And I'm sorry that we seem to have traded one sort of misery for another.
It turns out that houses deep in the backwoods
always seem to be awful and unnatural in their loneliness.
If there were only a ruined abbey around here with bats in it,
the view would be perfect.
Our roof is ramshackle and sheds water nicely in dry weather,
but we have to spread milk pans around the floor when it rains.
Still, outside the kitchen,
there are already anemones and heartsease
and even prettier flowers
which my stupidity keeps me from naming for you.
I believe I've enjoyed myself less these last few weeks
than any other female who ever lived.
During what little time I have to myself,
Finney reads aloud instructions for wives from the Old Testament.
But when it comes to the Bible,
I have to say that there are a lot of passages he may know word for word,
but which haven't touched his heart.
I can't account for his state of mind except to say
I can't account for his state of mind except to say that my company must be intensely disagreeable to him.
And if that's the case, I'm sorry for it.
[man] Good afternoon!
Afternoon.
Whoa, whoa. Hey.
Got something for you.
There you go.
-Thank you. -Good day.
-Is it for me? -From Schoharie County.
-Your Abigail. -Give that to me.
Give it. Finney, give--
-Finney. -"What's to become
of the thousands of our sex
scattered out in the wilderness and obliged to tax our strengths?
I feel as if, at that selfsame hour, when our prospects were brightest,
that in the dim distance, a black shadow approached.
And yet still, imagine the happiest of unions for us of the sort
in which two families, previously at daggers drawn,
are miraculously brought together on love's account.
It is your face I bear through the night.
It is to you I devote a dreaming space before I turn myself to sleep,
but there is no sleep.
It's as if within me everything clamors for air,
and I think if it's like this now, what will it be like later?
I send you what love and support I can.
I send you all my heart's hopes. Abigail."
[Tallie] Please know that force alone
couldn't have gotten me here to a place like this.
I was told that I had to act in support of interest, happiness
and the reputation of someone I once loved.
As far as I can figure, we're now still only about 85 miles apart.
But of course, people like us don't go on long visits.
[Abigail] Dyer refused first to permit my departure, and then to accompany me...
and only caught up to the cart at the end of our property and climbed aboard.
We were the very picture of anguish, rattling along side by side.
The night was fair and warm with the appearance of a coming rain, a shower.
[Tallie] It's so hard to write about how much I want to thank you,
but I have to start somewhere.
Abigail...
I want to tell you that being with you, even alone,
has been like being a part of the biggest
and most spacious community I could ever imagine.
I feel closer to you than I would to a sister
since everything amazing that I feel...
I chose to feel.
And do you know what memory it is that I most cherish?
It's of your turning to me with that smile you gave me
once you realized that you were loved.
I have no way of knowing what is to come.
But I do know that all of the trust, and care and courage we shared,
that will all shine on us
and protect us.
You are my city of joy.
You are my city of joy.
[Finney] Might I ask your business? [Abigail] I've come to see Tallie. Where is she?
I heard you on the road. You made such a racket, I took you for the tin knocker.
We've ridden for three days. We're not leaving without seeing her.
I'm not concerned with what you will or will not leave without.
-[Dyer] Keep a civil tongue, friend. -Where is she?
I treated her with tea of soot and pine-tree root to good effect.
But sickness always tests our willingness to bow before the greatest authority.
My guess is that it was diphtheria.
No!
[Finney] There is some alienation from marital...
What time is it?
I don't care.
-I have to go. -You're gonna make a mark.
[Dyer] Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
[Abigail] Sunday, August 31st.
Weather very hot and sunny.
I cleaned out the shed, which was full of rusty and dusty rubbish,
washed the windows and preserved apples for the winter.
Fourteen dollars from the sale of our milk and butter.
I have cut my hand with a paring knife.
I console myself with the conviction that someday in the future
when Dyer is forced to travel to Syracuse for feed or supplies,
I will join him, and take his rifle
and go to Skaneateles and kill Finney where he sits.
Dyer has been at work on the barn.
Each day, we enact our separation.
Sometimes after it gets dark,
we walk over the hills across our upper fields for the wide, wide view.
And Dyer tries to imagine us as we were...
while I try to imagine Tallie in that cordial and accepting home
that existed solely in our dreams.
I imagine Tallie and Nellie somewhere together,
and Nellie running her brush through Tallie's hair.
I imagine banishing forever those sentiments of my own
that she chastened and refined.
I imagine resolving to do what I can for Dyer.
And I imagine continuing to write in this ledger,
here, as though this was my life.
As though my life was not elsewhere.
I've always feared that I would bring misfortune to those I loved.
Are you really saying nothing to that?
I don't know where to start.
I can't imagine what more we could do for one another...
with our constraints.
You can't?
I can't.
You can't?
Well, then...
