-Bonsoir. -Bonsoir.
-How are you adjusting? -Better.
-How are you adjusting? -Better. Good.
Congratulations, de la Torre. -She’s a very lucky woman. -Not as much as I am.
-She’s a very lucky woman. -Not as much as I am.
Monsignor. A pleasure seeing you.
Your father would be proud. It’s what he wanted for you.
Your father would be proud. It’s what he wanted for you. I would like to think so.
Don Felipe, always a pleasure seeing you.
You should come by the house.
I have some new cigars I think you’ll enjoy.
You don’t say.
Excuse me.
Ignacio.
Carmen, it turned out exquisite.
I’m glad you came, Ignacio.
Amada is waiting for you.
Modest.
It belonged to Ignacio’s mother.
Poor woman.
If only she knew where it would end up.
On your sister’s hand, Luz.
Half sister.
Don’t worry. You too will soon find husbands.
Sure. I hope he is a foreigner.
Like Romain.
Lorenza and Romain.
Will you excuse me?
Ladies.
I hope you have no objection to me stealing Amanda.
Just in time.
And to think, in my hometown, all I wanted was a little sister.
You look lovely.
Félix!
Ignacio.
I knew something was missing from this party.
Mr. President, I apologize for being late.
Félix.
So effusive, as always.
Congratulations, Ignacio.
I heard you finally got appointed to Congress.
What a nice wedding present.
No doubt that Mr. President is quite generous.
Only to the deserving.
Thank you for your trust, Mr. President.
What is given can also be taken away.
So you better honor your part of the deal.
To make my daughter happy.
That’s all I want in life.
But Villada is one of the president’s men.
And now, so am I.
Does Díaz know about this?
I wanted to consult with you first.
If he found out, he’d consider it treason.
Do you…
or do you not want to replace Villada?
Of course.
But why with you?
If the president were to change the official candidate…
who else would he choose?
Perhaps my memory is failing me, but I don’t think I’ve seen you before.
I just started here.
Evaristo Rivas.
Ignacio de la Torre. -Nice to meet you. -Likewise.
-Nice to meet you. -Likewise.
Do you usually stay here so late?
A bad habit.
One I share.
May your union be fertile.
May the both of you see your children’s children,
and after a happy old age, may you arrive at the pearly gates
and after a happy old age, may you arrive at the pearly gates to be met by Jesus Christ, our Lord.
to be met by Jesus Christ, our Lord.
Amen.
It’s almost a miracle everything turned out so well.
The dance floor was crowded when we left.
Even Luz congratulated me.
The Limantours left early.
I hope it wasn’t because of the food.
Don’t you think we’ve toasted enough?
It’s never enough.
This is Dolores, your personal maid.
Socorro and Francisca are the two other maids.
Doña Gertrudis, the cook.
Marco is the valet.
Doroteo,
Francisco, Roberto, Aníbal…
and Lucas.
Isidro is the cook’s assistant, as is Juan.
And Mateo is the stable boy.
I was about to leave, and…
I thought you might want a drink.
I was going to work for my father, but that wasn’t going to end well.
So I came here instead.
Is your whole family still in San Luis?
Let’s say that the distance does us good.
When my father was alive…
I volunteered to visit the estates.
The farther the better.
“The farther the better.”
And what does Mrs. Rivas think?
There isn’t one.
Waiting for the right one?
And waste my time?
-Yes? -Mr. Congressman.
I was about to leave. Do you need anything else?
No, thanks. You can go and rest now.
-If I may? -It’s okay.
You were playing well.
You need to relax your wrists.
So your fingers fall on the keys with their own weight.
I may not know how to play piano,
but I bet you don’t know another woman who can clean, load, and set up a rifle.
Luckily.
What were you doing up so late?
I was waiting for you.
I don’t like you losing sleep on my account.
It’s the only way to see you.
Amada, it’s not proper for you to be like this in the living room.
Everyone’s asleep.
I haven’t finished my work for today.
-Can it wait till tomorrow? -It’s for your father.
Senator Téllez.
-After you, please. -Always so kind.
A box of El Buen Tono, please.
Good luck in the session tomorrow.
Wow. The nation’s son-in-law honors us with his presence.
Show some respect, please.
Ignacio.
My dear.
Mr. de la Torre!
Tell your wife we ladies all loved her dress.
It was divine.
-Who made it? -Enough. -I’ll get you the tailor’s name later. -No, don’t give her any ideas.
-I’ll get you the tailor’s name later. -No, don’t give her any ideas.
Good evening.
-Good evening. -Good evening.
How’s married life?
Some duties are more difficult than others.
I met someone who could fit in well here.
Let me guess. You’ve already invited him.
Ignacio.
What do we have rules for?
For everyone else.
Nacho.
If you ever do this again,
-I’ll kick you out. -“I’ll kick you out.”
Listen, gentlemen. Who will--
I’m an old fox!
Thank you, Doctor.
Some rest will take your anxiety away.
She won’t forgive me for not inviting her to the wedding.
Dad and Carmelita didn’t let me.
Even though everyone knows she’s Indigenous.
How long has it been since you’ve seen her?
Six years.
Ignacio…
You and Dad are all I have.
Rest up.
You must take off your shirt.
Excuse me?
You may still leave if you wish.
Evaristo Rivas.
Have you come of your own free will?
Yes.
And do you know what unites us in brotherhood?
Socratic love.
And do you, Evaristo Rivas, confess to being eligible to join our society?
I do.
I’m a queer.
Do you swear to keep secret what occurs here, even under pressure?
I do.
Evaristo,
welcome to the Club of, now, the 42!
welcome to the Club of, now, the 42! Welcome!
Gentlemen, let’s raise our glasses to our newest member.
Cheers!
I’ve never seen so many queers in one place.
I knew you’d appreciate it.
Did you go through this as well?
Who introduced you?
Don Felipe.
He was a close friend of my parents.
He invited me as a present for my 18th birthday.
Maximilian passed on the club to him before he was executed.
You’ll love it.
That’s Aristeo.
He’s the only founder left, but unfortunately, he rarely comes now.
Cheers!
Those two are senators.
That one is Agustin.
The newest member until you arrived.
Gabriel introduced him. They both like to wear women’s clothing.
Carlos is a board member of the Bank of London.
He’s a very interesting guy but sometimes a bit complicated.
Gustavo is a bit of an introvert, but he’s great.
And you’ve already met Rafael.
-Welcome. -Thank you.
-Where were you? -My dinner ran late.
-With whom? -Friends.
-You left me worried. -I’m sorry.
I didn’t have time to let you know.
I sent a message to Dad’s house.
They’re looking for you.
Why did you do that?
You didn’t show up. I assumed something terrible happened to you.
Next time, don’t worry so much about me.
I wouldn’t want you to faint again.
What’s going on here?
These gentlemen are asking for you.
Excuse us, sir. We were told something had happened to you.
-Well, now you see I’m okay. -We apologize.
-It’s a beautiful apology. -Do you accept it?
Wouldn’t it look better with a bracelet?
Maybe a pair of earrings?
If something was to happen for real,
at least we can count on my dad.
What a relief.
Did you think I wouldn’t find out?
Pardon me?
You’re conspiring against me.
Mr. President, I wouldn’t even try.
Then what do you call going behind my back to promote an agenda I oppose?
It’s no secret the ranchers are displeased with Villada.
They think I could defend their interests better because I share them.
And they suppose I’ll support you.
Are they mistaken?
You don’t even meet the criteria to be governor.
You need to grow up.
You’ve never hesitated to adjust the law to benefit the people, Mr. President.
How is my daughter?
Happy.
As always.
This conversation is over until you reach the legal age.
-Mr. President-- -Ignacio!
De la Torre. It’s your turn.
My wife wants to have a little suit made for him.
But I don’t think it’s a good gift for a boy.
He won’t be excited about it.
-How old is he now? -Ten.
A bicycle.
-Aren’t they dangerous? -They’re terrible.
On cobblestones, you get jostled around so much you could die.
I think there’s a new model with inflatable tires.
What will they invent next?
Well, if that’s true, I’ll buy him a bicycle.
And have the suit made too to avoid problems with my wife, right?
How modern of you!
I don’t mean the tires, but for giving in to Carolina so much.
When you’re part of a family, you have to compromise.
That’s something you’ll never understand.
Do you live here?
Since I was kicked out of my house.
You need to go out. Meet more people.
I think you’re in the right place.
Do you want to have fun?
Gentlemen, I sincerely apologize for having to leave you like this.
One more. A rematch.
And you?
Can’t even say hi?
How are you, Mr. Congressman?
I thought we had a deal.
And I thought you had more important things to do.
Ignacio.
-Stay a little longer. -No, it’s late.
He likes to ride his mare in the mornings.
Come with me.
Eva.
Eva.
Put the chair in front of the mirror and the candle closer to the bed.
Ignacio.
What are you doing?
I don’t want you staying up because of me.
Please don’t change rooms.
We haven’t even been married for a year.
The doctor said you need to sleep well.
Did I do something wrong?
-Something that bothered you? -No.
Nothing.
This is a better arrangement.
For your health.
They agreed to leave us alone in the box.
When he gave me the ring, all the audience clapped.
I want a story like that!
There are plenty of stories like that. The problem is what comes next.
And how is it, Amada?
What comes next.
Well, I can’t complain.
The other day, Ignacio gave me a diamond necklace.
I couldn’t say no.
Has he had more dinners that last until the next day? Luz.
Don’t be so thoughtless.
No, Luz.
No, no more long dinners.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts, dear.
These things disappear when you least expect.
One day, you’re his sun,
and the next, he’s gone to get warmed up in another place.
Isn’t that right, Carmelita?
-Elena, would you like a glass of water? -No.
-Anyone else? -No, thanks.
What a good time, right?
Did you like the gift I sent?
I didn’t think you would get so many signatures.
Now we’re just missing the most important one.
Álvaro, Manuel.
I want an in-depth report on this boy’s political viability.
Of course, Mr. President.
Thank you.
It’s not a “yes,” Ignacio.
It’s a “we’ll see.”
Excuse me.
What position?
Governor of the State of Mexico.
You have dishonored the woman.
En garde!
What a tragic penetration.
He had gonorrhea!
Since you’re all here, I would like to announce
Since you’re all here, I would like to announce that the annual ball will take place on November 17th.
that the annual ball will take place on November 17th.
In the immensity
Of the waves, floating, I saw you
And going to save you
The whole thumb, I stuck in
Your sweet vision Eternally engraved on my soul…
Your sweet vision Eternally engraved on my soul… -I like that. I liked it. -You are tired.
-I like that. I liked it. -You are tired.
Ladies, I think I’m going to turn in now.
Party pooper! -But why, Nachito? -I have to plan my campaign for governor.
-But why, Nachito? -I have to plan my campaign for governor.
-Of what? -What else? Of Sodom!
-Of the State of Mexico. -Even worse.
I think you could become president, Nachito.
Evaristo would be the First Lady.
-Indeed! I like that. -Miss Blondie de la Torre.
Gentlemen, can you imagine?
Our next orgy could be at the Chapultepec Castle.
Yes! I’ll wrap myself in the flag. -Ignacio de la Torre for governor! -Long live Nacho!
-Ignacio de la Torre for governor! -Long live Nacho! Shut up already!
Mr. de la Torre!
Don’t forget about your girls when setting up your cabinet.
Hey.
That’s what you get for encouraging them.
What’s going on, Félix?
People like to talk, Amada.
I AWOKE WITH THE SHIVERING OF YOUR KISSES ON MY BACK. EVA
I’m new at the bureau. They treat me very well.
My husband treats you very well?
Well, actually, I work with various senators, and…
I invited Eva to spend the evening with us.
You’ve been reading my mail.
You leave me no other option.
-I should come back some other time. -Sit down.
My husband is exhausted from working so much.
You must know better than I.
I was telling Amada about the work I do as your lawyer.
-Eva and I were talking about spending-- -It’s Mr. Rivas, Amada.
Talk properly. You’re not in your village.
Do you mind me calling you Eva?
No.
Eva and I talked about spending Saturday in the country.
I don’t think Mr. Rivas can.
He’s very busy with some contracts.
-I thought it was a bill. -That too.
Why did you come?
Because the invitation was in your name. “Mr. and Mrs. Ignacio de la Torre.”
Please, don’t come again.
Give it to me.
I won’t ask again.
Give it to me.
I’m not stupid enough to keep them there.
Amada!
Amada, what are you doing up there?
Amada!
Leave me alone!
Don’t slip.
Since when do you care what happens to me?
Get in the house.
You, go away!
Amada!
Go away!
Ignacio, you have to give me a child.
If you don’t, I’ll share what I know.
What will they say about you?
We’re married, Amada.
The least you can do is keep up appearances.
For me.
Doesn’t everyone think we’re…
deeply in love?
He probably won’t come today either.
Evaristo, it isn’t wise to behave like this.
Like husband and wife.
It won’t end well.
COME BACK, I MISS YOU. EVA
I’m afraid the electorate doesn’t have the best opinion of you.
I’m sure you can find a more favorable sample.
With all due respect, Mr. Congressman, your lifestyle is the talk of the town.
How do I know the results are not biased?
Because I guarantee it.
Who do you think advised the president on his last three reelections?
I advise you not to run.
You have no chance of winning.
And the general doesn’t like to lose.
Doña Carmen, Mr. President.
Ignacio.
I’m glad you could find the time.
-Did Álvaro and Manuel deliver the report? -Porfirio. Not now.
Not yet.
There will be time to talk about these issues over dinner.
…duality a little extreme.
-It was a bit more restrained. -Yes, not like now.
Now it seems like social encounters like this are much lighter.
Yes.
-More enjoyable. -More relaxed.
What a lovely house.
Thank you, Carmen. A pleasure to have you with us.
Red snapper with ravigote sauce, Dad.
Just how you like it.
Look at you.
Soon you’ll teach Luz how to be a good hostess.
It’s a little dry.
It’s delicious.
All you need now is to be a mother.
Porfirio.
What?
I can’t say that?
I want grandchildren.
How long have you been together?
-Ignacio. -We’re working on it.
That’s what I wanted to hear.
Did you know where the term “ravigote” comes from?
-No. -From French.
It means “vigor.”
This sauce invigorates the diners’ appetites
from its making to the time of ingestion.
How are you today?
What are you doing here?
A wife can’t visit her husband?
What are you doing?
I’ll cure you.
God free you of your sin…
Touch me again, and I’ll have you locked up in an asylum.
I’m not afraid of you. I was born in a battlefield.
Get out.
Not until you give me a child.
Let go of me!
Ignacio, give me a child.
Ignacio.
Amada, open up.
It’s for your own good.
Amada, open up.
Amada! Open up.
Open up!
Amada!
What is it, my daughter?
I’m worried about Ignacio, Dad.
Whatever you need, Amada.
-What’s wrong? -I’m being followed.
-By whom? -I don’t know, but I know who sent them.
Were you followed?
No. No, I don’t think so.
Let’s get out of here.
Where?
Out of the country.
That’s crazy.
I know.
We were starting to worry about you, Nachito.
-What is this? -Your new bodyguards.
-I don’t need them. -That’s not your decision.
Very well.
-So have them watch over Amada. -No.
They’re for you.
You don’t have the authority.
You’re mistaken, Ignacio.
I have all the authority.
And if you don’t like it, speak to the president,
Nachito.
Have them keep watch outside, Teo. They can’t be here.
Thank you, Teo.
-Who is it from? -Amada, this is unbearable.
Who is it from?
The tailor.
-They’re pressuring us, sir. -I get that, but what do they want?
A meeting with you.
No, I can’t. Tell them--
Mr. Congressman?
Tell them I have postponed running until the next cycle.
There we go.
You look gorgeous.
Turn around.
There we go.
You’ll look gorgeous in this dress.
Forty-two tickets, only one winner.
Who’s feeling lucky today?
-Whose idea was this? How great. -Midnight raffle!
One ticket per person. Don’t be greedy.
You look beautiful.
Forty-two tickets, only one winner.
May I?
You want one?
-Me, please! -Midnight raffle!
The train leaves at seven.
Shall we?
-Good evening. -Good evening.
Thanks.
Cheers.
What is it?
There was a raid on a party on La Paz Street.
At first, it seemed normal, but then I realized there were only men.
Get to the point, Félix.
Those who seemed to be women were men in dresses.
We arrested 42, sir.
I only see 41.
My son will find out.
My son will find out.
I’m going to die.
My son will find out, and I’m going to die.
Get this faggot out of here.
-Pigs! -Get out of here, sickos!
Those here are an example of the putrefaction
Those here are an example of the putrefaction that must be eradicated from our society.
May the lesson of these sick men serve as an example
May the lesson of these sick men serve as an example for all those who seek to go against the principles of morality.
Let it be clear.
Rotten weeds will be uprooted without any hesitation.
For the good of our society and the safety of our families.
I asked my dad to let you stay at home.
Did you tell your dad about Evaristo?
What for?
God sees all.
Amada, please.
If you help me get Evaristo out of jail, I promise--
He was sent to Yucatán.
At least he can atone for his sins.
Mr. Congressman.
The president wants to know if he can count on your vote on the floor.
Tell him he can.
La bohème is opening at Teatro Principal.
Can we go?
If you want.
Or would you rather go to Tacubaya for the weekend?
Ignacio.
Sorry, what?
Would you rather go to the opera or the summerhouse?
I don’t care.
Evaristo died.
I don’t know anything else. I just know he died.
We're Super Monsters We become monsters at night
-Sun down... -Monsters up!
That's a lot of decorations.
And that's a lot of fairy lights.
These fairy lights are so tangled, even the knots have knots.
Don't worry, Igor! We'll help you untangle the lights.
-And we'll help you hang them up. -But first,
-And we'll help you hang them up. -But first, we need to untangle you.
Oh, thanks, children. I'm not sure how this happened.
-It's all right. -It's okay, Igor.
-It's all right. -It's okay, Igor. Oh!
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Spike, it isn't quite Christmas yet.
It's still Christmas Eve.
Oh, okay. Merry Christmas Eve, everyone!
Merry Christmas Eve, Spike!
Santa always says that fairy lights and decorations
Santa always says that fairy lights and decorations really put him in the Christmas spirit.
Tonight, I want to try and make Santa the biggest,
brightest,
Christmas display ever!
We can use our super powers to help.
I can't wait to get started!
Well, you won't have to wait much longer. Look.
Sun down... Monsters up!
Drac!
Katya!
Lobo!
Zoe!
Frankie!
Cleo!
Spike!
Vida!
Super Monsters!
Igor, I know Santa loves Christmas decorations...
Oh, he certainly does!
But remember, there are other ways to celebrate Christmas, too.
Well, of course there are!
But with the Super Monsters using all their powers
to help me decorate the school,
this year will be the biggest and brightest celebration
Santa's ever seen!
He's going to love it!
How many of these lights do you want us to put up?
All of them!
All of them? Really?
Okay!
Does that mean we should use all of these decorations, too?
Of course! Only the best for Santa.
Let's go! Mega-size! Let's start over there!
Working together, we have fun
Come give a hand
That is the way we get things done
Working together
We're Super Monsters, here we come
Growing together, we work and play
That's how we get things Done-done-done d-done!
It looks amazing!
Thanks, Katya!
Zoe... how do we get out of here?
This way!
-That's all the fairy lights! -Beautiful! So beautiful!
Well done, Super Monsters.
That's everything we had in the attic.
Now let's put up these decorations from the basement.
There isn't anything left to decorate!
Oh, there is one thing left, and it wouldn't be Christmas without it.
The Christmas tree!
I'll get it. Mega-size!
Here it is!
Before we decorate the tree, can we turn on the other decorations?
I can't wait to see it all lit up!
-Oh, yeah! -I want to see it!
Of course we can!
Frankie, I'll turn on the fairy lights
if you'll power up the rest of the decorations.
Ready?
Ready! Frankie Mash, monster smash!
We did it!
Wow!
Uh-oh. That's not good.
Oh, no! My monster smash blew out the lights!
No, Frankie. This wasn't your fault.
I should have known all those extra lights and decorations
would take too much power, but...
I did it anyway.
And look what happened.
I ruined Christmas for everyone.
Poor Igor! He's really upset.
We should go and find him. Maybe we can help him feel better.
Good idea, Frankie. Yes, come on.
Igor, where are you? Where did he go?
Not in there.
Not here, either.
Found him!
Igor, we've been looking for you.
We were worried about you.
-We were. -All of us were.
Are you okay?
I'm sorry, Super Monsters.
I got so carried away
with trying to make the biggest, brightest Christmas display ever,
that I blew out all the power, and I ruined Christmas.
It's okay, Igor. Everybody makes mistakes.
Oh, thank you, children.
And you didn't ruin Christmas. We can still decorate the tree.
But no-one will be able to see it in the dark.
Don't worry, Igor. We'll find a way to make it special.
I bet my dad will know how to fix the power.
I just called him. Mr Mash is on his way.
Oh, that's great.
Maybe he can turn the lights back on before Santa gets here.
It looks like somebody got their power working. Over there.
See those twinkly lights?
Those aren't twinkly lights.
They're fire dragonflies.
Come on, Spike. Let's go!
Ready, Spike? Ready, Cleo!
Wow!
Wow, look!
-Oh, my! Would you look at that! -Amazing!
We love to gather round the tree And see our best friends there
It's not about the things we have But it's the things we share
Spending time together
It's the best time of the year
Holidays are so much fun Whenever friends are near
-Igor, what's the matter? -Don't you like the tree?
Oh, I don't just like it... I love it! Ho, ho, ho!
So do I!
Santa Claus!
Igor, my old friend!
I've never seen a more beautiful Christmas tree.
I can tell it was decorated with true Christmas spirit.
It certainly was!
Thank you, Super Monsters.
You reminded me that the most important thing about celebrating Christmas
isn't how you celebrate it, but who you celebrate it with.
I've fixed the power. You can turn the lights on when you want.
Thanks, Dad.
But... could we leave the lights off just a little while longer?
-Yeah! -Can we, please?
Of course we can, Frankie.
Glorb, you're absolutely right.
This tree does need a star on top.
Which one would you like?
Really? From up there?
Wow!
How about that one?
There you go.
Thank you, Santa. It's perfect.
-Wow! -Looks good!
It's time to say good night.
And I think it's time to turn the power back on.
Ready, Dad?
Monster smash!
-Thank you, Mr Smash! -Thank you!
Thank you, Frankie, and Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, Mrs Carradine.
I suppose we have to take down some of the lights,
or the power will go out again.
Poor Igor! He's so disappointed.
Dad, isn't there some way we can use our monster powers
to light up all of Igor's decorations?
Well, we can try.
Maybe I can add a little Christmas magic to your monster magic.
Let's get these decorations powered up.
Monster smash!
-Oh, wow! -Look!
-It's so pretty! -Oh, it's just how I imagined it.
Thank you! You made my Christmas wish come true.
Maybe we could add a few more lights?
Igor!
You know, old friend, I think it looks perfect just the way it is.
Santa, can you stay for snack time?
Igor made ginger snaps with lemon icing.
Ho, ho! My favourite biscuits!
But I really can't stay much longer.
The reindeer and I still have a lot of gifts to deliver.
Was that a reindeer?
Were those Santa's reindeer?
Well, Santa's sleigh's still here.
But what happened to the reindeer?
-Someone untied their reins. -Who would do that?
I think I know who.
-Glorb! -Henri!
You two are very naughty monster pets.
It's okay, Katya.
Henri was just being playful, and Glorb was just being Glorb.
But what about your reindeer?
Oh, I'm sure they're just having a little fun
and playing one of their reindeer games.
What kind of games?
Their favourite game is hide-and-seek.
Oh! We love playing hide-and-seek!
Don't worry. We can find your reindeer, no matter where they're hiding.
Come on! We need to get the other Super Monsters and...
find those reindeer!
Super Monsters, Santa is counting on us. We can't let him down!
-Yeah! -We can do it!
Let's go!
We're sorry, Santa.
We looked everywhere. But we can't find them.
I told you they were really good at hiding.
But I need to find them soon,
or I won't have enough time to deliver Christmas presents
to everyone in Pitchfork Pines.
Oh, no! You mean our friends could wake up on Christmas morning
and not have any presents?
We can't let that happen!
I'll keep looking for them. They can't have gone too far.
If we can't find the reindeer, maybe there's another way we can help.
Well, I'm not a flying reindeer, but I am a flying vampire.
Maybe I can pull Santa's sleigh.
Oh, bats! It's too heavy. Let me help you.
I'll help, too! Mummy power!
Watch out!
Mega-size!
Wow! The sleigh is really heavy, even for mega-me.
Oh, I have an idea!
Christmas magic, bright and shiny, the sleigh is too big, let's make it tiny!
Okay. The sleigh and I are ready to fly.
That's a great spell, Katya, but won't it make the presents too small? Oops!
Good point. Christmas magic, that wasn't the way!
Good point. Christmas magic, that wasn't the way! Santa Claus needs a much bigger sleigh!
I still can't find my reindeer.
Super Monsters, can you use your super powers to fly the sleigh?
can you use your super powers to fly the sleigh?
-We've been trying. -Drac pulled.
-And Spike helped push. -Cleo added her wind power.
And Katya used her magic.
Oh, dear.
If working together didn't help, I don't know what will.
I do.
You already know how to work together, but this will help you fly together.
First, we'll need a strong, stretchy rope.
Oh, instead of stretchy rope, how about stretchy vines?
May I?
Yay!
Oh, that's perfect!
Oh, oh, oh! Can I drive?
Super Monsters, let's fly!
Ho, ho, ho! It's working!
Yeah!
-Well done! -Hooray!
Now everyone in Pitchfork Pines will get their presents.
I hope so, but I might not be able to deliver all the presents
before the sun comes up.
But you have to!
I'll try my best, Frankie,
but climbing down chimneys takes a lot of time.
Oh, I can use my zombie powers to help. Then you won't need the chimneys.
I can use my mega strength to carry the bag of presents.
And I'll use my speed to help put the presents under the trees fast!
Sounds like we have a plan!
We're going to save Christmas!
Oh, no! The roof's too steep to land.
The sleigh will slide right off.
But if we land on the ground, someone might see us.
It'll spoil the surprise.
It's okay, Spike. Vida's with us.
This way, Santa.
Let's go!
Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh Hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tail ring Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way!
Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh!
We did it! We delivered presents to everyone.
Well done, Super Monsters!
You saved Christmas in Pitchfork Pines. -Hooray! -Yay!
There you are! I know you were having fun,
but did you forget we have an important job to do?
If it hadn't been for the Super Monsters, Christmas in Pitchfork Pines
If it hadn't been for the Super Monsters, Christmas in Pitchfork Pines would have been ruined!
Thank you for all your help, Super Monsters.
I couldn't have done it without you. Bye!
Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas! -Bye, Santa!
What an amazing night!
And it just got "amazinger"! Look!
Presents!
Santa gave Henri a new cat toy!
And he gave Glorb a teddy bat.
And he gave us the best gift we could ever wish for!
-How do you know? -You haven't even opened them yet.
We know those presents will be great.
But the best present was being able to work together.
And help Santa save Christmas!
-Yeah! -Yes, it is.
Now, that's what the Christmas spirit is all about!
It certainly is!
Sun up! Super Monsters!
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Super!
Monsters!
-Super! -Monsters!
We're Super Monsters We're human in the daylight
We're Super Monsters We become monsters at night
In Pitchfork Pines we learn And help each other grow
There's magic in twilight That's when we start to glow
-Sun down... -Monsters up!
Drac, flying fast!
Cleo, wind power!
Spike, dragon clouds!
Zoe, zombie vision!
Lobo, super speed!
Katya, magic spells!
Frankie, stomp!

NETFLIX PRESENTS
Methamphetamine. Philopon. Also known as crank.
It decreases your need for sleep and makes you fearless.
This incredible drug that literally gets you high
was invented during the Pacific War.
Japan immediately used this drug for military purposes.
The first ones to get high on this drug in the history of mankind
were kamikaze pilots.
They took crank
and entered the enemy lines without any fear.
They gave crank to factory workers to make them work without sleep
and gave it to soldiers to make them become fearless in war.
After the war ended,
there were many addicts who couldn't forget the high it gave them.
Once the Japanese government put a ban on crank,
Japanese drug dealers turned to Busan, a nearby city in Korea.
During the time when everyone was determined to work hard for better lives,
Japan's need for more factories
and Korea's drive toward expanding exports coincided.
That's how the heyday of crank began.
There was a self-made man who started this golden age of crank.
"Made in Korea."
The legendary drug king who dominated the Japanese market
with the finest crank there was.
He was a law-abiding citizen by day
and a drug king by night.
He lived two different lives,
and was both loved and hated by everyone of the era.
It's this man right here. Lee Doo-sam.
1972, BUSAN
This is the goldsmith I told you about.
He is also fluent in Japanese.
My name is Lee Doo-sam.
If you screw this up tonight,
dozens of jewelry stores in Busan will end up going bankrupt.
So you'd better stay alert.
-It's been a while, sir. -Hey.
The gold is real, but the watch is...
Everybody, freeze!
-Come over here. -I'm sorry!
It's the cops. The cops are here.
-There's nothing here! -Wait. Don't move.
Hey, catch them.
Over here. Open this.
There's nothing here.
-Let go of me! -Over here!
Hold on!
Hey, catch them!
Damn it!
Hey, get over here.
It's cooked well.
It was hard trying to fool the Japanese on your first day, wasn't it?
Why didn't you tell him beforehand?
Eat up.
Count them.
-So, you went to college? -I dropped out after paying the tuition.
No wonder you seemed smart.
When did you learn goldwork?
I wanted to learn a technique to earn a living.
So I chose to deal with something expensive.
That's your reason? That doesn't mean you own all that gold.
I pretend like I do.
Otherwise, my work will be no fun.
There are 152 bills. Two of them are ripped.
Don't forget to take your share. That's the most important part.
You can keep working with this guy.
Here.
Gosh, hurry up.
This is incredibly fresh.
-How much is this? -They're all fresh. Look.
Get moving, will you?
-When did I say that? -That's enough. Stop it.
Move!
Pushcart coming through!
Here you go.
Relax your fingers.
Hey, did you enjoy your piano lesson?
-Smile. -Look over there.
-Smile, everyone. It won't take long. -Look over there.
Here we go.
One, two, three.
One more time.
-I'm Kwak. -Nice to meet you.
-Hello, Mr. Kwak. -Doo-sam, let me tell you something.
When men meet each other,
they exchange business cards, not money.
All of those guys are big shots in Busan.
If you're in that group,
you won't get caught even if you do bad deeds.
Hey, Mr. Kwak.
He's a director at Yongdu Shipping.
-Yongdu Shipping? -Yes.
I've never heard of it.
They don't operate fishing vessels.
They operate the Yongman, which used to be a US Navy ship.
Mr. Kwak wants to offer the sailors side jobs
for when they go back and forth Japan to fix the ship.
We just need to borrow the ship for our mutual benefit.
This ship is really clean. This used to be the US Navy's, right?
Does that mean this ship
is like the little brother of the USS Missouri?
Here. Please check it.
Well, I'll get going, then.
Doo-sam, this is delicious. It melts in my mouth.
Don't eat it all yourself. Share it with the kids.
You're unbelievable for someone who lives in a church.
The ones who collect taxes are the real thieves.
Even in the Bible, tax collectors are considered worse than whores.
Mun Ik-jeom didn't declare those cottonseeds he brought in.
My gosh, you look like a completely different person.
Just don't get caught, whether it be smuggling or cheating.
I'm a pastor's daughter, for goodness' sake.
Should we turn on the record player?
Gosh, don't.
My goodness.
Seriously, stop it.
Kids, look.
Will you please stop?
My goodness, seriously.
-Dance with us. -There's no stopping me if I start.
Doo-sam! We've got a problem. Doo-hwan's about to get beaten to death.
What? Why?
You punk!
Damn it! You motherfuckers!
You motherfuckers!
-You sons of bitches! -You little punk! You lunatic!
-You little punk! -Stop it. Stop!
What did you say?
Just die, you little punk.
Look at you, all covered in blood!
Are you his older brother?
I'll pay you back for everything.
He may seem reckless, but he's way too chicken-hearted
to have taken much. Aren't I right? Answer me!
Please forgive him. I'd make him pay with his life if I could.
Hey. You have to do whatever it takes to make him pay with his life
if you truly think he should.
Don't you agree, you piece of shit?
Who are you?
I normally don't mix my drinks.
What are you doing?
-Doo-sam. -Hold him.
I will... I'll drink it.
Fucking hell!
You bastard!
Gosh, look at him.
Are you okay? -Gosh. -Is your ear still attached to your head?
-Gosh. -Is your ear still attached to your head?
Okay, let's go. Let's go eat.
Hey, Doo-sam. What brings you here?
-Nothing much. -Doo-hwan, are you hurt?
No, I'm fine.
-Why are you here? -What?
Here, come have some smokes with me.
My aunt's in-law in Osaka
travels around Japan with a troupe to do local performances.
That's not the main point.
The thing is, he's hospitalized because his appendix burst.
But he needs to deliver something by today.
What is it?
Smuggling using the rice cookers isn't profitable anymore.
So, what is it?
It's crank.
Crank?
Do you know
how to gut a fish?
If you screw this up,
I'll cut your stomachs open.
We do our business based on trust,
so we don't work with people who don't trust us. Let's go.
Hey!
What the fuck? What?
They're expensive.
I don't deal with anything that's cheap.
OSAKA, JAPAN
Then we should collect our money from the start...
So you're telling me that Hideki's...
appendix burst?
Are you Korean?
Yes.
I'm from the North.
My parents once lived on Jeju Island.
Oh, really?
Well, if we were born a little earlier, we'd all be from the same country.
I'm so glad to meet you.
I was born in Manchuria,
but I somehow ended up in Busan.
Every time I meet Koreans living abroad, it feels as if I met my siblings.
Are you crazy?
He is... a commie.
So what?
He's from the pro-North Korean group.
If things go wrong, we might get arrested as commies.
I'd rather get caught as a commie or a smuggler
than just starve to death.
I'll take care of everything, so just stay quiet.
-You're hungry, aren't you? -Yes.
Goodness.
I didn't even get to pee on my way here.
Hey. Why don't we go get something to eat?
Look.
Bring me one more of this.
If you get caught making crank in Japan,
you get shot to death.
Is that why they're building factories in Korea?
The factory itself isn't a big deal. What matters is the cook.
Depending on who the cook is,
you either get a nice product or complete garbage.
There's this really famous cook.
Professor Baek.
Professor Baek?
He was brought here as a forced laborer and ended up working in pharmaceuticals.
The stuff he makes is really famous.
The ones made in Korea are the best. Taiwanese ones are no good.
You know how good Koreans are with handicrafts.
Korea has good water.
Busan especially has
the perfect water and air for cooking crank.
That's why the color comes out amazing.
I had no idea. It's because of good water?
Wait a minute.
Then what would happen
if we import the chemicals from Japan, cook it in Korea,
and sell it back in Japan?
It'll be a gold mine if we manage to make it and sell it.
It'll be a bonanza for us, right?
President Park Chung-hee has issued a decree
to wipe out illegal smuggling.
Even the KCIA's Head of Inspection is coming?
Chief Kim, you bastard!
You'd better take responsibility. We knew nothing about it.
Damn it.
Do you want to see me get tortured in the KCIA headquarters?
We can't get a hold of Doo-sam. What should we do?
Chief Kim. I'll help you escape the blame, so please cover for me.
In exchange, I'll give you Lee Doo-sam.
They asked me to come here. Where is everyone?
That little bastard.
You asked me to come here. I'm a busy man, you know.
I came all the way here amidst my busy schedule.
Wait. Hold on...
Mr. Kwak, what's with your face?
Who are these people?
Hey, smuggler.
How dare you use this ship to smuggle saccharin?
It... It wasn't saccharin.
Gosh, do you want to visit our KCIA headquarters?  I'll kindly pour some spicy soup into your nostrils.
I'll kindly pour some spicy soup into your nostrils.
I really didn't know anything, sir.
I'm telling you the truth. Please let me go.
I'd never have done such a thing if I knew this ship belonged to the KCIA.
How dare you use the government's precious ship
to satisfy your own greed?
You little scum.
Gosh.
Please don't kill me. I beg of you.
I have three kids
and three younger sisters who haven't gotten married yet.
Is that piss?
-He peed so much. -That's gross.
Goodness, are you scared?
Should we call your mommy?
Isn't he Captain Choi of the Yongpal Gang?
I heard Captain Choi controls all the smuggling routes to Japan.
Apparently, he's in here for adultery, not smuggling.
Your boss ran off to Japan.
You're the only one who got caught.
You were a complete lackey. Do you get that?
Gosh, look where all that loyalty got you.
How's your health?
Listen to me carefully.
You know how sincerely Kim Gu's mother cared for him when he was in jail, right?
Our family depends on you now.
Our family has always depended on me.
What are you thinking? Are you planning to escape prison?
Hey.
Do you have some money?
Goodness.
I guess you like being in here.
Why don't you just stay here forever?
Public servants are bound to be involved in this.
Try your best to convince him and bring him over.
Okay?
BUSAN CUSTOMS
The deputy chief security officer here went to the same high school as me.
But the thing is, he's very strict and stern.
Yes, I'm sure he is.
I mean, he spends his entire day among all the criminals.
But regardless of how strict and stern he may be,
I'm sure we'll be able to woo him and win his favor.
Why do you want to talk to my husband?
Goodness, you're his wife? I'm so sorry.
I thought you were his daughter. You look extremely young.
-You have a really nice house. -Wait. Hold on.
Hello.
Who are you?
-Get out of here! -Wait, sir.
-Just get lost. -My goodness.
-What do you take me for? -Gosh.
Hurry up and leave. Throw some salt out there!
Sir, please!
He's not an easy guy to convince.
He won't suddenly become nice just because you woo him a little.
ACCOUNT BOOK
I don't care about any of that.
I want you to take responsibility and win him over.
BUSAN CUSTOMS, CHIEF KIM
If you don't, I'll take that notebook and visit the KCIA headquarters.
Inmate 1538.
You're a tuberculosis patient now.
You'll be on parole under the condition that you don't leave your designated area.
You've been granted a stay of execution and will be released.
Then do I need to stay at home?
Would you rather stay here instead?
I'll stay at home.
You'd better be good to your wife until the day you die.
Money may not be on your side, but your wife is.
After having been abducted by unknown assailants,
former New Democratic Party's presidential candidate, Kim Dae-jung,
safely returned home in Mapo-gu, Seoul yesterday
at around 10:20 p.m. after five days in captivity.
To identify the ship used for the abduction,
the police are investigating all the ships that departed from Kobe to Busan,
including the Buja, the Hyoam, and the Yongman.
Goodness.
Are you sure he's getting out today? The tofu will go bad.
Attention, everyone.
The 10:20 a.m. bus to Daegu will depart soon.
I have this new business plan.
And it has solid prospects.
We will import materials, manufacture the product with our skills,
and export the product.
Are you listening?
Are you crazy?
What if the cops come and look for you?
Then do you just want me to stay at home? Do you want to starve to death?
Just tell them I'm missing. Say you can't reach me.
You must be eager to make me divorce you.
Sook-kyung, you deserve to live a decent life for once.
Just trust me and bear with me a little bit.
Hey, you know Yuk Young-soo, the First Lady, right?
You'll get to be someone like her, okay? You just wait.
Let's see.
I heard my old classmate lives somewhere around here.
Where could it be?
I heard I have to go through Captain Choi of Yongpal Gang to sail to Japan.
Why did you get caught with that if you're so good at being sneaky?
You went to jail for adultery, right?
Goodness, look at you.
Every man needs that kind of spirit.
No wonder your colleague's wife moved in with you.
Thank you.
Captain Choi. Let's do business together.
You're not even good enough to eat with me.
Yes, I know that. You're way better than me.
But are you going to keep living a lowly life like this?
I heard something about you too.
You got beaten up for using the KCIA's ship, didn't you?
I heard you're really close to the narcotics squad chief.
Let me use your connection.
I'm going to sell Philopon. I'm talking about crank.
Fuck off. I don't smuggle crank.
All right.
Just like you said, I almost got killed by the KCIA.
Do you know what it's like to get beaten to death?
My dad and my grandfather both got beaten to death. It's crazy.
It's like a family tradition.
That day, I told myself as I washed my bloody underwear
that I'll become someone who has strong connections.
You can't live in this country
if you have no one to call when you're close to dying in vain.
Captain Choi, let me borrow your connection.
What about the chemicals?
We'll import the chemicals from Taiwan,
manufacture crank in Korea, and export it to Japan.
It's our turn to go with the trend and make tons of money through exports.
Selling crank to Japan is considered an act of patriotism.
The Qing dynasty fell because of opium. We can make Japan fall with crank.
One shipment of crank will help you make more
than 100 shipments of rice cookers.
You know the suppliers and I get the biggest share, right?
Of course.
And here.
Women love this the most.
I know because I used to work at a jewelry store.
Shouldn't you two at least have a small wedding?
Say hello. This is Chief Suh Sang-hoon from the narcotics squad.
I'm Lee Doo-sam.
I hope you watch over us.
And there's something
I picked up on my way here. It's nothing much.
These days,
I am really busy chasing down singers who smoke pot.
I'm sure you know this very well, but the most important thing
for a crank dealer is...
never to do crank.
You'd better keep that in mind.
If you want to be there when your son enters college,
you'd better not do crank.
Why would I take that expensive stuff?
You'll know what I mean the moment you try your first crank.
The first time is the best. But things that start well don't end well.
You've never seen anyone go broke because they couldn't forget the high
from their first crank, have you?
Anyway,
did you find a cook?
Life is all about fun, and crank dealing is all about finding a good cook.
Professor Baek? You mean the Professor Baek I know?
How stupid do you have to be to think of working with that guy?
The first thing cops do when there's a robbery is to look for the locksmith.
Professor Baek is the locksmith in this field.
You're going to get fucked.
Hello, sir.
Gosh.
This is Professor Baek.
He's a legendary figure who brought crank to this land.
I'm sure you already respect him even if I don't tell you to.
He's the famous Captain Choi.
He's been sailing to Japan ever since he was 15.
And he's friends with the narcotics chief.
Don't worry about getting busted.
This is Wang Mun-ho. He's Chinese-Korean.
He can handle all the shipping from Taiwan.
And he's pretty good at English.
Talk in English for us.
He's also good at acupuncture and cupping.
You should do cupping therapy for Professor Baek sometime.
I don't think anyone could do a better job
in gathering such a perfect group to represent our country.
Doo-sook.
Bring him a cup of Taster's Choice.
Taster's Choice?
She's my sister. She graduated second place in her class
and was offered a secretary job at a bank, but I brought her here.
She's just like me with numbers. She's very good at counting money.
And he's my cousin, Lee Doo-hwan.
He would've become big in the US if it weren't for me.
You also speak a little English, don't you?
Right?
English...
Have a seat. Come on. Sit.
You see, I don't ask for much.
I just want my kids to eat well and sleep warm.
And if you stick by my side,
you'll never have to starve to death even if your luck's rotten.
You know, what matters is that we understand each other.
Let's do this.
Hello!
What?
What do you think of Lee Doo-sam?
Well, he seems trustworthy.
He's smart too. I think he's okay.
What about his underling?
Who? You mean Choi Jin-pil?
He's the actual big gun here.
Choi Jin-pil's the big gun, not Lee Doo-sam?
Yes.
Choi Jin-pil is the big gun.
Choi Jin-pil is the big gun?
Jin-pil keeps a separate ledger.
He and Wang Mun-ho are embezzling money.
Right? I knew it.
Here.
Take this money and stay low.
Don't spend it all and find yourself in handcuffs. I'll call you.
Did you not learn division in math class at school?
Division.
Isn't that what we learn in language class?
"Don't cause divisions."
We're going to have to count the numbers again.
You'd be in jail if it weren't for me. You're able to make money because of me.
What kind of bullshit is that?
We do all the dirty work! You fucker, don't touch me.
Good work, all right?
Give the materials to Professor Baek.
That little...
One is musk.
Musk has always been a precious fragrance that has the ability to revive people
who are weak-hearted, agitated, or have fainted.
And the other one
makes musk seem like nothing.
I heard you work for Captain Choi, who used to be in the Yongpal Gang.
Who? Me?
He's not my boss. I'm handling all the products myself.
People in Osaka are already talking about how great our stuff is.
You know, I felt upset to see all of our best products go to Japan.
So I thought I'd sell some of our stuff in Busan.
Gosh, my legs. My legs hurt so much since I've been kneeling for so long.
Let's work together, Mr. Jo.
Don't you think you'd be better off running a jewelry store?
Aren't you better at making gold rings for babies?
Whether it be gold or crank, everything I touch turns into money.
Did I gain weight? Why's this jacket so tight?
I heard the boss among all bosses in Kobe is from North Korea.
Do you mean Soo-gon?
We're like brothers.
If I put in a word for you,
you'll be able to transport your crank by his ship without a hassle.
But he's not easy to deal with.
Just like the bar girls in Ginza, he's very good at reading people.
How about we do this?
For now, I'll give you all the crank I'm planning to sell here.
But help me go to Japan.
I'll go persuade the Kobe boss who reads people
and the Ginza bar girls.
KOBE, JAPAN
You know the yakuza organization named Yamaguchi-gumi, right?
This place is their hometown. Those guys are the real yakuza.
Once, they came to Busan and ordered black bean noodles.
There were five of them, but they only ordered four.
-Only four. -Why?
They all are missing a finger.
So what?
"Ma'am, we'd like five servings, please."
They only got four servings because they all are missing a finger.
Just like this, you know?
You don't need all your fingers, do you?
Give me one that you use to pick your nose.
Doo-sam, are you sure they are going to show up today?
Stop acting up and wait here.
A deal will be made here today.
Yes, it's ready.
It's Room 703.
One is Lee Doo-sam from Busan, and the other one is Lee Doo-hwan.
We will disguise ourselves as them and get rid of him.
Yes, I understand.
Hey.
Close the door. Close it.
Take the bag and go upstairs. It's Room 703.
Why?
Just do as I say.
As soon as you get there, show them the product.
-Tell them we're the ones from Busan. -Okay.
Hurry. Go now!
Stay alert, you punk.
Please call Room 703 for me.
Yes.
Hello, this is Lee Doo-sam.
We agreed to meet today.
We arrived a bit early.
By the way, I was wondering if you have
agreed to meet...
someone... other than us.
No, that's not it. Aren't there any Koreans there?
Damn it.
I'm Lee Doo-sam from Busan,
sir.
Why can't they understand a damn thing?
One of our men is down! Go and get the bastard!
Doo-hwan! Get that bastard!
Get that guy in front of you! Get him!
You piece of shit!
Hurry up!
-Let go, you jerk! -You little...
-You bastards! -You punks!
Doo-hwan!
Hey, Doo-hwan! Catch him! Stop him now!
You jerk!
Which gang are you from?
You jerk!
We've taken care of everyone. You can come out now.
I'm Lee Doo-sam.
I'm Lee Doo-sam from Busan.
-Doo-sam. -Yes?
Drink up. Drink.
This is a celebratory drink.
Why don't we drink this together?
Thank you.
Cheers.
Quit acting up!
Hey, come over here. Come!
I feel great!
Hey, Doo-hwan.
Doo-hwan!
Wake up, you punk!
ONE THOUSAND YEN
1974, BUSAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
Will you clean the bathroom? It stinks of urine.
I'm Prosecutor Kim In-gu from Seoul.
Oh, hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Suh Sang-hoon from Ministry of Health.
Hello.
Come on. Let me introduce you to everyone. Let's all say hello.
He's the prosecutor from Seoul who will be working with us.
Hello.
-Hello. -Hello.
I'm Prosecutor Kim In-gu.
What are you doing, Sook-kyung?
I'm cooking ox bone soup since my husband's home.
It's not him you're cooking, right?
I'll take his knee bone out and make some soup with it
if I ever catch him cheating on me.
Oh, my. I just can't get you.
-Do you like him that much? -Of course. I love him.
Let's get divorced.
Have you gone nuts?
Listen to me.
I'm supposed to be missing right now. That can be the reason for our divorce.
If you divorce me for that,
I won't have to be on the run anymore.
Then what about me?
Remember those mental patients at Minister Kang's prayer house?
You know the ones who can't even remember their own names?
Bring me one of their ID cards.
Why?
So you can marry one of them.
Don't you get it? I'll be living under his identity,
and you'll fall for the new me and get married.
Sook-kyung, let me tell you something.
One man isn't enough for a woman like you.
I really don't have the guts to live with you anymore.
Look at you. Are you happy that you will get married again?
Have you gone mad?
Check out a rich neighborhood.
Let's move to one of the big houses there and start a new life.
You can open up a nice piano academy.
Although my husband is currently in the food distribution business,
he's an incredibly cultured man.
He has perfect pitch.
Listen.
Hey.
How's your health?
Mr. Lee.
How about we expand out of Busan
and start developing the domestic market?
It's not that I haven't thought of doing that.
What's wrong? Are you scared?
No, that's not it.
It's way different from getting Japanese people hooked on crank.
Our country's already in chaos with all the student riots.
Let's think about it a bit more.
Look at this drug dealer worrying about his country.
You're quite the patriot.
My gosh, what's with Prosecutor Kim?
He learned how to investigate like the FBI from the US Army.
But why can't he catch anyone?
What? That's not fake money.
It's Prosecutor Kim's loan for his new house.
Is everyone here?
Today... Hey, come inside.
This guy is...
a druggie.
Hello.
Today, we'll be catching a crank dealer that's a member of the Sunggang Gang.
Our code word is "Janis Joplin."
But those guys are really careful. I've never even seen any of them myself.
It's okay. You'll do fine.
-I'll try my best. -Okay.
-Chief Suh. -Yes?
Don't be nervous.
I'm not nervous.
I'D LIKE TO BUY JANIS JOPLIN'S RECORDS
Who's waiting to buy Janis Joplin's album?
Please answer the phone.
I love Janis Joplin.
The way to get an album...
Hello?
Where?
Where? Oh, okay.
Why are these punks coming exactly on time today?
JEIL MEDICAL CLINIC
Is this the medical clinic?
Did the green truck arrive?
Gosh, he should be there by now.
This guy was fertilizing the field
and got bitten by a poisonous snake. He left in his truck.
Gosh, he must've passed out on his way there.
What are you doing?
Hurry up and check outside.
Are you okay? Who got bitten by a snake?
What?
Sir.
-What? -Roll down the window.
-I heard you got bitten by a snake. -No.
-The snake-- -Did you get bitten?
-No. -Will you please open the door?
You have the wrong truck.
Sir.
Are you really okay? Are your eyes twitching?
-Let's get out of here. -Sir.
Hurry up and drive!
-Hey! -Follow that car!
Stop right there!
That little bastard.
Stop!
Where did you get Philopon?
I bought saccharin to cook some sweet noodles.
Why did you go to Japan?
To meet a friend.
Which friend?
A friend of mine.
You met a North Korean friend?
Why did you meet a North Korean?
What is this about?
I used to work at the Public Security Division.
I caught a dozen commie spies.
But how many of them do you think were actual spies?
You should choose
whether to be accused of being a commie or a druggie.
Which do you think sucks more?
There's this lunatic
named Lee Doo-hwan.
His cousin is Lee Doo-sam.
He used to smuggle with the UN Gang, and now he sells crank to Japan.
Lee Doo-sam?
Lee Doo-sam
got released from Masan Prison because of pneumonia,
and he's been missing ever since.
-What about Choi Jin-pil? -Him?
I heard he got out of the gang and is making a living as a merchant.
Then let's catch Lee Doo-sam, Choi Jin-pil, and Jo Sung-gang first.
Come on, Prosecutor Kim.
Jo Sung-gang is a gang boss, after all. We can't get to him that easily.
Let's just arrest a druggie who's addicted to crank.
No, let's use this chance
to lock up all the drug dealers along with the yakuza.
I'll request an arrest warrant. Track down their locations first.
What's wrong with him?
How much money did you and Professor Baek embezzle?
-You went to Japan with Jo Sung-gang? -I didn't embezzle money.
We're going to expand to a new market.
I told you not to work with gangsters!
Then who should we work with? Churchmen?
You must think you're so cool working with gangsters.
Don't you know what will happen if things go wrong?
What? Tell me. You ran off with your colleague's wife, so tell me.
It seems like you enjoy stripping naked and waving your dick around,
-but that will get you killed. -That mouth of yours...
You punk.
An arrest warrant was issued for me, you, and Jo Sung-gang.
That prosecutor from Seoul is crazy about catching us.
Tell Professor Baek not to act up and stay low.
Or go ask Jo Sung-gang to save your ass.
What a fucking idiot.
Mr. Jo, it looks like they're determined to root out drug dealers.
I'm taking off tonight. Please look after Doo-hwan.
Okay.
Go meet Mr. Koo in Yeouido, Seoul.
That was America's best era.
You could sleep with whites, blacks,
Native Americans, Eskimos, whoever you wanted.
Women were full of love then.
The country was full of resistance, peace and love for humanity.
And full of drugs too.
The Qing dynasty fell because of opium, but the US seems to be doing just fine.
Artists need drugs.
In order to become a developed country,
Korea should at least start legalizing marijuana.
Don't you agree?
Even grannies smoke marijuana when they take short breaks
while farming in the countryside.
This will get you high the quickest.
Speed?
Foreigners
tend to like meditative stuff that calms the nerves.
Compare this to the ones you get from America.
So, you own a pharmaceutical company?
I think you and I will be able to work together.
Here. Did I finally surpass my master?
I guess you won't need me anymore.
Aren't you even going to try it? You've tried it before, right?
The first ones the addicts afflict are their wives.
And I hate that more than anything.
Have a good life.
Okay, let's begin.
Cute, right?
What? What's wrong with you? Hey.
Is it that good?
It's very good.
Jung-ah Kim.
She used to be a hostess at a famous bar in Seoul.
She speaks Japanese, French, and English. So they bring her as an interpreter.
What? Who does?
Her boyfriends.
Who are they?
If you sleep with that woman,
that's when you know that you've become
a big shot.
You know Chairman Jin, the Ginza Typhoon?
Hey.
Are you talking about the boss of all the bosses? That Chairman Jin?
She's his adopted daughter.
At least that's what they say.
She's a real handful.
Who's the guy next to her?
Who's he?
Oh, that's Director Hahm Chang-ho of the KCIA.
He used to be the head of the Public Security Bureau.
Some say he's Kim Jung-ah's lover,
and some say he looks after her.
Anyway, he's the number three in rank in the KCIA. That bastard.
I'm Lee Hwan-soo.
I see.
Mr. Lee Hwan-soo.
When are you free tomorrow?
I'm busy tomorrow.
But you'll still have to eat. Let's eat a meal together.
I'll think of you every time I eat tomorrow,
so let's just say we ate together.
Goodness.
What a nice house.
So, you're in the trading business, right?
Do you handle all the exports in Korea?
I don't like red.
There's this bar called American Bar in the Savoy Hotel in London.
It's a lively bar with over 100 years of history.
Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable, Grace Kelly...
Tons of famous stars had visited that bar.
Drinking a glass of champagne there
makes you feel like you're back in time, drinking with them.
-I wonder if you know how that feels. -Ms. Kim.
Let's drop all the fancy talk and just start dating each other.
Selon ta bourse gouverne ta bouche.
You should live within your limits.
That's the secret to longevity.
I really hate men who have nothing but money.
Regarding the upcoming election,
it's going to require a lot of money,
and we can never have enough resources.
Mr. Lee insisted on helping out,
so I'm introducing him to you out of pure patriotism.
I was born in Manchuria,
and our president has a great spirit since he's from there as well.
I've earned enough money.
If I could make one wish,
it would be to meet the president in person and shake his hand.
NAPOLI FOODS, LEE HWAN-SOO
I'll become a loyal supporter of our president and nation.
You export food to Japan?
Just like what our president says,
the only way for our country to grow is increasing exports.
-You're a pillar of the industry. -I feel bashful.
All right, then.
Let's think about what you can do for the president
and our nation.
Look over here.
Hey.
-Good work. -Let's sit down.
Gosh, it's great to be rich. I even get to ride on an airplane.
Did you bring your stuff?
What's the name of it?
The name?
Crank is just crank. Why would I name it?
This is also a form of export, so it should have a brand name.
A brand name?
A brand name...
Yes, that's right.
TOKYO, JAPAN
If you want to sell across Japan, you need to get through Chairman Jin.
Even Yakuza graduate college and do legal business nowadays.
They do a lot of charity work and support cultural assets.
They're also in Mindan and the Central Intelligence Agency.
They're involved with everyone that has power.
The Japanese elite can't let anyone know
that gangsters help them with the election.
So they do this to deceive the public eye.
You just need to make sure no one can say anything
-about whatever bad deed you do. -Ready.
WELCOMING EVENT FOR SOUTH KOREA'S NATIONAL WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM
Papa.
You're beautiful as always.
Goodness, how pretty.
Papa.
This is CEO Lee Hwan-soo who recently became friends
with me.
He's chairman of the fundraising committee for the Korean athletes.
Thank you for inviting me. It's an honor.
Mr. Lee will be of great help to us.
This was made by Korea's greatest craftsman.
The statue's filled with drugs.
Is the entire thing filled with it?
I guess it is.
Hey, scumbag.
Look at how successful you've become by shipping saccharin.
You're even wearing a suit.
You can wear fancy clothes, but you can't hide your foul smell.
Not everyone is allowed in here
even if they're capable of paying for the meal.
NAPOLI FOODS, LEE HWAN-SOO
I've washed my hands clean, and I only do legal business now.
I was reborn, you see.
For a jerk like you to be reborn,
he first needs to die for real.
Maybe I should've buried you deep down under the sea that day.
I think you and I need to have a long talk
as we walk in the sea breeze.
What's wrong?
What's that jerk doing here?
He used to be a KCIA inspector.
Mr. Baek? Do you know him?
That little piece of shit.
He works at the embassy now.
Doing what?
What do you think?
He catches commie spies.
What's wrong?
I don't really like him either.
What do you say? Should we visit some Ginza bar girls?
Fuck, I shouldn't have come.
Did you meet Chairman Jin?
Look at you. These days, you only deal with the big shots.
That guy's political philosophy is completely different from ours.
Cut the bullshit.
What kind of a philosophy would a gangster have?
We're still fighting the Korean War here.
Then go ahead and fight with a spear in your hand.
I don't care who's who as long as I get to sell my crank.
That's how you guys are. You South Koreans have no loyalty.
Stop talking like that. It's been ages since the division.
So just cut the fucking crap.
Why do you keep cursing?
What's that bastard doing here?
Damn that bastard.
Who is he?
The KCIA jerk working at the embassy.
He's the jerk who threw me in jail back when I was a smuggler.
That damned bastard.
I know that punk very well.
He claimed some Korean students in Japan formed a spy group.
And he put my cousin on that list.
My family got ruined because of him.
Your family consists of yakuza, entertainers, and spies?
You idiot.
I'm living under someone else's name because of that asshole.
That little scumbag.
That fucking bastard
is going to try to throw me in the sea.
Fuck.
Get out.
Who's the jerk next to you?
I want both of you to get out.
You fucking bastard.
Doo-sam.
You even hang out with commies now?
-Pull harder! -Damn it.
You little...
No!
You fucker, leave me alone! Leave me the fuck alone!
Why are you so obsessed with me?
Fuck!
What happened? Is he dead?
That fucking bastard.
We're blood brothers now.
We'll live and die together.
We'll live and die together. Do you understand?
From now on,
we're starting over with a group of people who haven't taken any bribes.
No friends, family, or colleagues can know about this.
And whatever we talk about here shall not be revealed to anyone.
"Made in Korea."
I got this from a Japanese cop. It's being distributed all over Japan
under this name.
But I got a tip
saying it's being sold in Busan.
It's not that I don't trust you.
But this business
can only be run
when there is
trust, faith, and loyalty between two parties.
That's why I'm giving you this job.
Here's your cut.
Thank you.
I'll see you.
Goodbye.
-Goodbye. -Bye.
Goodness gracious. Jesus! What the fuck? Who are you?
Wait.
Hey!
You fucking asshole.
I'm sorry, sir.
-Did you buy that house? -We've been living in a motel.
Thanks to you, my firstborn was conceived in a motel.
Her name is Jang-suk.
-Jang-suk? -It means "long-term stay."
"Long-term stay"? That's hilarious.
You can pay me back by making this quick.
You even deal drugs now?
I was asked to deal.
What kind of fool asked you to deal?
Suh Sang-hoon.
It was Suh Sang-hoon.
Suh Sang-hoon?
Suh Sang-hoon in the narcotics squad?
He sells drugs?
He offered to split the shares in half. He asked me--
He offered to split the shares in half. He asked me-- Where did Suh Sang-hoon get the drugs?
His bribes are paid in drugs.
Choi Jin-pil and Suh Sang-hoon used to be real close,
but as soon as he found Choi Jin-pil useless,
he sided with Lee Doo-sam.
He gave me the leftover crank he got from Lee Doo-sam,
saying I can earn some pocket money by selling them.
So what else could I do?
I mean, he calls it pocket money, but it's enough to buy a house.
Wait.
Lee Doo-sam?
The guy who used to be the UN Gang's lackey?
Goodness, Mr. Kim.
Lee Doo-sam is no longer the Lee Doo-sam he used to be.
He took over Japan and Busan.
He's become the king of crank.
Do you get it?
He's improving our country's reputation.
You know nothing.
1976, BUSAN
Hey.
Hey.
You can keep eating.
-Mun-ho, how will you -Yes, sir?
gain strength by eating black bean noodles?
Goodness.
You sure are Chinese.
You eat that stuff every single day.
See you, Boss.
You're eating that every time I come here.
GOLDSTAR TELEVISION
NEW VILLAGE MOVEMENT
THE NEW VILLAGE MOVEMENT LEADERS' MEETING
THE 1977 ANTI-COMMUNIST LEAGUE GENERAL MEETING
Honey, help.
Honey.
What's wrong with you?
You bastard.
Did you think I wouldn't know, you jerk?
-Doo-hwan. -Honey, please help.
-You bitch! -I'm sorry.
-Please don't do this. -Doo-hwan.
-Tae-gu. -Doo-hwan.
What's wrong with you?
Don't come near me, you jerk!
Doo-hwan, give me that knife. I know you're a good guy. Give me--
-Don't come near me, you jerk! -Hey.
INN
Doo-hwan.
What's going on with you?
I told you to stay at the prayer house, didn't I?
Why did you lock me up in there? Why? Do you know what they did to me?
They beat me up every single day, you bastard.
I'm sorry.
How could you do that to me?
I'm... I'm sorry.
Fuck!
Doo-sam! You fucker!
Give me crank!
Give me my share, you bastard!
Doo-sam!
Doo-sam, you fucking jerk!
I guess someone needs to die for you to show up.
You bastard!
The dead guy is Doo-hwan's friend, right?
It'll cost a lot to deal with the body.
Okay.
Give me my crank!
Gosh. Doo-sam, you rotten bastard.
I'm the one who got you this far.
How dare you look down on me?
How could you be so ungrateful?
Mr. Jo, what do you mean "ungrateful"?
I made a man out of a punk
who used to drink another man's piss, and this is how you treat me?
If you ever try to pull tricks again and plot things without me,
you'll end up losing your head.
I won't say it twice.
When that happens, you'd better have two coffins ready
for both you and your cousin.
He apparently opened a clothing shop for her here.
She used to be a hostess at the most famous bar in Seoul.
What are you doing, Sook-kyung?
You're going inside?
Sook-kyung.
Why would an educated woman like you
volunteer to be a mistress?
Doo-sam's greed is as dirty and enormous as the Busan coast.
Will you be able to handle him?
What did you just say?
Didn't people mistake you with the late First Lady
and bow to you on your way here?
You bitch. What did you just say?
How should I address you?
Your husband isn't earning money in a respectable way.
Don't try to act all noble in front of me. Just focus on raising your children.
Marriage brought you no luck, but your kids might.
You dirty whore.
Do you want to go to jail for adultery?
My gosh.
Hey, lady! If I had been punished for adultery,
I'd have already gotten a life sentence. So fuck you.
"Fuck you"?
You're no ordinary lunatic.
You're damn right.
Now that you've enjoyed watching this crazy bitch,
you should go home.
Doo-sam!
Lee Doo-sam!
Lee Doo-sam!
Hey.
Hey, I'm here. What's wrong?
What is it?
What...
I am here. What's wrong?
Now that things are going your way,
have you no fear?
What?
Do you want me to teach you what you should be afraid of?
All right, okay. Lower your voice. Let's go home.
Home? You don't have a home anymore.
Don't even dream of setting foot in my house ever again.
I'm not going to raise my kids with a druggie anymore.
I... No, you!
You won't ever get to see your kids again.
Why can't I see my own kids?
Gosh, seriously.
What's this? What happened?
You've gone crazy.
Do you even know what this is?
What are you doing?
You...
-You! -What?
The Lee Doo-sam I knew is gone.
How could you screw up your life like this?
Without me,
you're nothing but a cheating druggie.
You shouldn't be doing this to me!
That greed of yours
will end up ruining you.
You reek of greed.
That incredible money of yours also reeks of greed.
That's going to get your life ruined. You'll end up falling in your own trap!
Cut it out.
Call the cops!
Tell them to arrest this druggie!
What... What's with you? Gosh, you've gone crazy!
"Crazy"?
Did you call me crazy?
What is wrong with her? She's gone completely insane.
What has gotten into her? She's completely lost it.
Seriously.
How's Director Hahm these days?
Is he trustworthy?
I don't keep useless people around me.
We'll hear about the approval on our business in Hong Kong soon.
Then I guess you'll cut me off as soon as I become useless to you.
Right?
So don't mess up.
Quit the drugs.
I'm not here to look after a local gangster.
The higher-ups can only tolerate so much.
Who's tolerating me?
Do they think they won't stink of dirty money they received from me?
That's right. They won't stink.
They won't stink no matter how much money they take from you.
But I've seen a lot of men get ruined by drugs.
Goodness.
How many druggies have you dated so far?
You always do this.
You can't have the world at your feet with this.
Are you hiding something from me?
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Eat slowly.
You'll get indigestion.
Someone reported that a druggie who escaped from the hospital
dined and dashed, so I went there.
And he said something interesting.
He says he's related to Lee Doo-sam, the Drug King.
He's Lee Doo-hwan, Lee Doo-sam's cousin.
I heard you chased after your ex-lovers every time you did drugs.
It's funny
how one of the main symptoms of crank abuse
is the development of delusional jealousy of one's lover.
I mean, why can't you trust the ones who are closest to you?
In the end, you can't trust anyone including your siblings or parents. Right?
You were quite famous at that hospital.
I'm never going to go back there again.
They don't want you back either. They're too scared of you.
But you can go to jail.
You can make a lot of friends there,
so you won't be lonely.
Goodness.
Finish your soup.
Gosh.
Your cousin's really mean.
I mean, I hear he is living an incredible life right now.
His product is all over Busan and Japan. "Made in Korea," right?
He dominated the world with that.
No way.
I'm the one who helped him do all that! Okay?
Doo-hwan.
So, is blood thicker than drugs or not?
Sook-kyung.
Where is Doo-sam?
I'm starving to death right now.
Doo-hwan.
Who are you jerks?
Hey, you asshole!
Wait.
Slow down. Wait.
Hold on.
Doo-hwan.
Doo-hwan!
Doo-hwan, what is this?
Hey, you punk!
Who are you, you asshole?
Doo-hwan!
Lee Hwan-soo.
No. You are Lee Doo-sam.
RESIDENT REGISTER: LEE DOO-SAM
Your wife ended up marrying the same man twice.
What kind of karma led you to cook crank at night
and promote rural and domestic development by day?
Lee Doo-sam is your real name, right?
Where's your hometown?
-Manchuria. -Manchuria.
No wonder
you've got so much spirit.
I heard you paid Suh Sang-hoon a grand sum of money.
Prosecutor, where's your hometown?
Listen, Mr. Lee.
I'm angrier at the government workers who feed off you
than I am at you and the gangsters who work with you.
So are you saying you're going to catch the ones who feed off me?
You don't have the guts.
Listen, you fucking bastard.
I admit that you're one of a kind.
You both work in factories, but do you know how much
those factory girls make in a day
while taking drugs and working around the clock?
They earn 600 won.
On the other hand, a single batch earns you
a billion won.
Goodness.
And your crank's called "Made in Korea"?
You think you're some kind of patriot?
Where do you even spend all that filthy money?
I get how you became the director of the KFCC.
But you're also the director of the Busan National Development Council.
"The chairman of Korea Women's Volleyball Association."
"The advisor of Korea's Anti-Communist League."
"The Schubert Society of Korea."
Is this the Schubert that I know of, you little jerk?
Sir.
You want to know where I spend my filthy money?
I don't spend it like a powerful man, but I spend it on the powerful men.
If I gave you
a bag...
filled with 100 million won, what would you do?
I'll keep it a secret, okay?
Goodness, did you just see that?
Something just crossed your mind.
Something...
But it's nothing to be ashamed of, you know.
I heard you're doomed if you do your own drugs.
Why are you digging your own grave?
I heard you see angels and devils coming down from the sky if you do crank.
Which one is on your side?
Which one of them do you think will stab you in the back?
Your cousin sold you out.
Aren't you worried that your wife might cheat on you as well?
See?
You've got all the money in the world, but you're always anxious
because you know you'll get caught one day.
And today is the day.
Find a person who will bring you food to prison
because I will get your wife locked up too.
You little bastard. Do you want to die?
How dare you lay your filthy hands on me?
Hey, listen. I'm an honorable prosecutor of this country, you bastard.
-Fuck. -You scumbag.
-You asshole. -Did you just block?
You piece of shit.
You bastard.
Do you want to die, you fucker?
Gosh, I can't stand him anymore.
Damn...
That little...
The district attorney wants us to let him go.
Fuck! Why?
Hey, Made in Korea.
A druggie has better connections than a prosecutor.
I'm impressed.
You crazy bastard.
Let's go.
You asshole, get back here. Hey!
Hey! Jung-ah, is that you?
My goodness.
No wonder.
I was wondering how a druggie had better connections than me.
But I get it now. What happened?
Why would the famous Kim Jung-ah come all the way to the countryside
to clean up after some druggie?
If you want to catch someone with no connections, catch a commie.
How'd your life become such a ruin?
A truly beautiful flower stays beautiful even when it withers.
Don't you agree?
I should also try to win your favor.
I didn't know you still have this much power.
Doo-sam. Druggie.
Do you think this connection of yours will last forever?
Think carefully about who's really on your side.
I told you to be careful.
Do you know how hard it was for me to keep your wife and sister safe?
Let your cousin go to jail.
I can only do so much.
Why?
Just go suck up to that prosecutor.
What?
Why would I humiliate myself by begging to a nobody like him?
It seems like you two are pretty close.
You men and your bloated egos...
What are you saying? Do you think you got me out?
It was my bribes that got me out. How dare you act like you did everything?
What?
Don't you...
glare at me.
Are you out of your mind?
Are you seriously saying that in this situation?
Is your brain working properly?
Do you think it is easy to get a druggie like you out of there?
You bitch. Look at you showing your true colors now.
How dare you treat me with no respect? You fucking bitch.
Gosh, what's this smell?
Has a fish gone bad or something? Get your stinky ass out of here.
-I will! -Get out right now!
Boss, Kim Soon Pyung is in Busan.
Soon Pyung is?
He killed a mid-level boss over in Japan, so a lot of people are after him.
Doo-sam, help me out.
I escaped to Busan to save myself.
But jerks at the KCIA are after me.
I heard one of the guys who was there that night told them what happened.
I don't know what you mean.
I'll get stabbed to death if I go back to Osaka.
I think I'm destined to live in my homeland.
My parents always talked about Jeju Island,
so I'll go there and raise horses.
Please help me.
I'll get you a boat. Go back.
If you don't help me, who will?
We're blood brothers.
Will you please leave me alone? I am in deep shit myself, you fucker.
I've been upset with you for a while,
but I've been holding it in.
What do you think I will do if you treat me like this?
What do you think?
Do you know how I feel right now?
I feel like I'm thrown into the open sea.
You're my lighthouse now.
I will entrust my life to you.
You'll do well.
I have one request.
Based on President Park's ideology,
we pledge to strengthen the unity of our nation,
preserve our national traditions,
and dedicate our lives
and loyalty to our nation and its people.
And in order to defeat the nefarious schemes of North Korea,
we will bring the people together
and do our best in our positions
to fortify our nation's security apparatus.
Goodness.
Gosh.
Because of the New Village Movement, no one's able to sleep.
Why are you drinking without any food? That's not good for your health.
Gosh, that's enough.
Mr. Kim.
His friend used to be a member of the Sunggang Gang,
and someone asked him to sell some crank.
But apparently, the guy who asked was a yakuza from Japan.
He's a Korean-Japanese who worked with Lee Doo-Sam
when he made his first export to Osaka.
And I heard he's in Busan right now.
He caused trouble in Osaka and stowed away to Busan.
He's in need of money, so he sells crank.
What a sad life.

Hello?
How are things in Seoul? I think I should go there.
Don't you watch the news?
The country's falling apart.
Show some concern for this country!
These so-called big shots don't care about the country at all.
President Park has declared martial law over Busan
in accordance with Article 54 of the Constitution
in response to the student protests that have overtaken the city.
Therefore, Busan...
No more political repression!
Damn it!
Last night, at around 7:50 p.m., President Park Chung-hee
was shot in the dining hall on the Blue House grounds
by Kim Jae-gyu, the director of KCIA,
and passed away at the age of 62.
As per President Park's will
and according to Article 48 of the Constitution,
Prime Minister Choi Kyu-ha will be taking on the presidential duties.
The government has declared martial law all over the country
except for Jeju Island
as of 4:00 a.m. on October 27.
And this afternoon, Choi Kyu-ha...
CHIEF LEE, PROSECUTOR HA...
Hello, may I talk to Chief Huh?
Hello, is Chief Jo there by any chance?
Tell him I'm the guy from Busan.
THE PLAZA HOTEL, SEOUL
No, wait.
Then is Director Lee Jae-sung there?
Is the district attorney there?
I'm his friend from Busan.
Hey, Mr. Koo. It's me.
What's going on?
No one's answering my calls. Did they all flee?
Then what about me? What's going to happen to me?
Just stay low and see how things turn out. And don't call me, okay?
Just stay low and see how things turn out. And don't call me, okay? Mr. Koo.
As President Park's funeral procession passes by Gwanghwamun
and enters Sejongno intersection,
endless lamentation...
Those bastards.
Why did they have to fire guns after taking my money?
A layer of fog blankets the city as if the skies are also in sorrow.
Many citizens pound the ground in grief as they cry out loud
about the vanity of our late president's death.
I was trying to live a decent life.
I've been a good person.
Those little bastards...
I'm going to kill those bastards.
I'll fucking kill them all.
1980, BUSAN
Hey, come over here.
Hey, it's me.
Did I get any calls?
Listen to me carefully.
There are people who are after me.
Kim Il Sung
sent armed commies
to get me.
Kim Shin Jo crossed the 38th parallel and climbed over the walls
of the Blue house to get me.
I'm serious.
Right now...
Let me talk to Jung-soo.
Hurry.
Hey, why isn't he answering when his dad's asking for him?
Come on.
You know me, right?
I devoted my entire life to this country's modernization.
You know I received a medal from the president, right?
That's who I am. This country needs me. I earned money for everyone.
You all would have starved to death without me.
So don't get any ideas and make sure...
you take good care of...
our kids.
Sook-kyung.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hey, you bitch.
I'll kill you if you betray me.
I'm going to kill all those bastards who are after me. Okay?
I'm the famous Lee Doo-sam.
Who...
Who's calling my name?
I'm Lee Doo-sam.
Who's calling me?
Hey!
I'm Lee Doo-sam. What do you want?
Show yourself! Don't hide!
You bastards.
I'm Lee Doo-sam--
Why are you hiding?
I'm right here!
Lee Doo-sam is right here!
Look. There's a CCTV here.
Is this the KCIA headquarters or what?
What was that?
You commies!
You'd better not come any closer.
He has a gun.
Do we have guns?
No, we don't.
I'm going to shoot you all, you bastards.
I think we need guns.
Those bastards.
I'll kill them all.
See? Come on!
I told you they'd cross the 38th parallel to get me.
What did I tell you? I was right.
We protect
This beautiful land
We live today
With vigor
We will risk our lives Going through the fires of war
And fight for the peace On our homeland and in our families
I will fight
To protect our nation
Come on out, you commies! I'll shoot every single one of you!
Lee Doo-sam.
Put that gun down.
Who are you?
Are you Kim Il Sung?
I'm Prosecutor Kim In-gu.
A prosecutor?
Fuck.
I brought...
I brought a lot of bullets. Where...
-I don't have any. -It's over. Put the gun down.
Are you here to kill me?
No.
Don't get worked up.
Think of your family.
Drop the gun.
Drop the gun!
I no longer want to get stomped on.
Mr. Lee.
I got shot, you see...
I got shot right here.
Goodness.
What...
How do you feel?
Why didn't you run?
Why would I run?
Gosh.
Kim Jung-ah got taken in by the Security Bureau. She's in a mess.
Mr. Lee.
The world has changed.
Let's wipe the slate clean.
What?
Oh, well...
You should become
a prosecutor who chases after the real bad guys.
Catching a guy like me won't change anything.
I mean, well...
I was just trying to help people make a living.
And let's be honest.
Do you know how many people made a living off me?
You can't deny it.
I swear this on my job.
If you don't cooperate,
I'll make sure you rot and die in prison.
It's time for you to wake up to reality, Mr. Lee.

Every day, we go about our routines.
Work, home, family.
But who are we?
Who am I?
You think you know your beautiful wife...
your adorable kids...
and who you work for.
But what if you don't?
And the truth...
once you knew it...
would change everything.
[woman] Another nightmare?
[man] Yeah.
I'm sorry.
[woman] Please see someone.
I'm worried about you, and so are the girls.
I can figure this out.
Wanna hear an even scarier nightmare?
This husband...
refuses to deal with his issues,
and so his wife goes insane from lack of sleep,
and pushes him out a window.
The end.
[monkey] Monkey see, monkey do!
Hey, what are you doing?
Playing with monkey. You can be my assistant.
I can be your assistant? Well, I'd love to be your assistant,
but I have to get to work on time.
But you know what?
Since we've all been working really hard lately, right?
Especially Herman.
Especially Herman, that's what I was thinking.
Why don't I get off of work early and we can go to the pier?
[girl] Does Hanna have to come?
-Hanna does have to come. -Yeah, your big sister has to come.
But we're gonna force her to have a good time,
and if not... I'll show you. I'll show you what we're gonna do.
No, no!
[laughing] Stop, stop, stop!
Speaking of which, uh, where is she?
-One guess. -Oh.
-Bye, Daddy. -Bye, Luce.
Oh, and Samantha keeps asking
when we're gonna have that party to celebrate my work thing.
Oh, yeah, um...
Let's do it tomorrow.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Okay.
I'm beginning to forget what our friends look like.
-Love you. -You too.
[whispers] The pier!
Good morning.
Lobby?
Yes, please.
It's nice weather outside.
No talking while the elevator is in motion, please.
Oh, that's right.
Okay.
Oh, look at that, perfect timing.
-Pete. -Hey.
Ms. Elevator Person.
How's the j-o-b?
Just a cog in the machine, sir.
I'd complain to corporate, but who would listen?
Thank you, miss.
Hey, Mr. Wright?
Can I come see Maggie later?
Totally. Hey, we've got a new sound system set up.
-Dance party time! -Awesome!
Actually, tonight we were planning on family night.
Okay, cool. Another time.
Enjoy!
-What are you trying to do? -Wait, wait! No, no! Wait, wait, wait!
I know I've been out of it these last couple weeks.
Weeks?
That was a good insult.
Thank you.
Can we please spend time as a family?
I really want to make it up to you guys.
So what are we gonna do?
I don't know.
Guess you're just gonna have to go upstairs and find out.
God dammit!
-[Peter sighs] -[woman] Reset.
Wow. I don't remember the last time I saw you crash a machine.
The current split and blew up both the systems.
Sleeping okay? Yeah. Well, better.
You know, it's funny, I was talking to somebody
You know, it's funny, I was talking to somebody and they were telling me about this clinic that people go to...
for, you know, sleeplessness and stress. I could get you the number.
-I'm just trying... -No, no. It's just a little mistake.
I'm gonna fix it.
Sure. I got you.
Okay.
-Let me know if you need anything. -Okay.
Oh, um... David?
Is there any way I could... take off early today?
Will you call the number for me?
Yeah.
All right.
[woman] The aim would be to update the drainage systems
along Prescott, Calder, and Willow.
Now, I believe that if we focus on the tunnels beneath these streets,
we could reduce overall runoff in the city's west side by up to 30%.
Thank you all so much. That's all for today.
They should have done the upgrade years ago.
Hey, that was great, Al.
-Thank you. -Not at all.
It makes me look good for promoting you.
You want to work late tonight,
talk about how to get this over the line with Water and Power?
Oh, I-I was actually going to ask you if I could leave early today.
-Yeah. -Thank you.

[woman] If we gave them a chance, maybe they could be of benefit to the planet.
Besides, whether we like it or not, they're here to stay,
so we should entertain the possibility
they be given the same rights as you and I.
[man] Same rights as you and I? They have no rights.
At some point, they will rise up,
they will overtake us, they will subdue us.
Okay? They will conquer humanity.
I don't mean to be alarmist, but it's happening,
we see it happening, and we need to take action now!
Alice!
Do you-- do you see that? Do you see that light?
That light?
[Alice] He probably just had to stay late at work.
You don't need to make excuses for him.
You have the right to be upset with him, honey.
He should have called.
He loves you, you know that.
[Hanna] Yeah, I know.
Good night.
[Peter] Hey, I'm really sorry.
-I see you got time to go shopping. -Oh, I got this for the girls.

-Can you just give me a break? -A break? From what, exactly? -From me? Or the girls? -That's not what I'm saying.
-From me? Or the girls? -That's not what I'm saying. Okay, well, it sure as hell is what you're doing.
Okay, well, it sure as hell is what you're doing.
I had one of those nightmares,
today... at work.
I passed out, and that's why I'm late.
Peter, I...
I am worried about you, okay?
I know.
This is me, this is your daughters, they're worried about you too.
I don't...
understand why you won't just get some help.
They're just gonna say it's in my head.
Because it is just in your head.

Can we talk about last night?
Hanna...
Hey, I'm sorry.
Hey, what's up with Herman?
-[Lucy] He won't talk anymore. -[Peter] Yeah?
Maybe he's mad at you.
Oh.
Well...
he has every right to be.
Hey, Luce, can I talk to Herman?
Herman, I understand your frustration,
and...
while an apology isn't fix-all,
I am sorry that I missed family night.
If you want, I can take a look at him,
see if there's anything I can do about that voice.
[Lucy] When's he gonna talk again?
I think if we just reroute one of these wires...
All right, Herman, what do you say?
[Herman] Monkey see, monkey do!
Thanks, Dad.

We're not alone.
But they... they don't want us to know what's coming.
They want to control us, don't want us asking questions.

Do you want to come through?
We're not crazy.

I need this to stop.

Well...
She didn't get to say anything.
I left before the appointment.

-We should use this. -[Alice] What? No.
-Alice! -No! No.
-I'm not putting the girls on that. -Alice!
-No! I'm not getting in there. -We need to get off this roof.

Mommy, please wake up.
[Alice] Peter, you have to tell me.
Hey, any luck with this?
[Peter] Um, the technology's not much different than ours,
but it's got a biometric trigger, which can only be shot by its owner.
-[Ray] Can you bypass it or something? -I'm working on it.
Either way, I don't think we should stay here much longer.
No, I think we need to leave the city.
Find some place to hide.
-Wait for help. -Wait, wait...
The factory I work at, it's not far from here...
and it's a government building.
And it's, uh... it's right there.
It's like... it's about ten blocks away.
[Samantha] Is it safe?
How do we know anywhere is safe right now?
Because of what's underneath it. It's all storage space.
It's like a fortress down there.
I mean, it's just getting there.
[Ray] Yeah, they're still firing at anything that moves.
Unfortunately, that's our only chance.
The tunnels.
The tunnels, there's the entrance...
What street? There's the opening on...
-Prescott! -On Prescott!
That's only a few blocks from here. We can get to the factory through the tunnels.
-[Peter] Yeah. -Yes.
-We can make it a few blocks, right? -Yeah.

Daddy!
Lucy!
Come on, let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

We're not going to let anything happen to you.
Okay? To either of you.
-Okay? -Let's go, let's go!
-Okay? Come on. -Let's go!

It's to the right.
Okay...

Okay?

I don't want to do this without you, please.
-Please, I don't want to. Please... -Promise--
I know you can do it.
Come on, you can do it.
Please.
Okay.
There you go, there you go.
Yes.
There we go, that's my Alice.
That's my Alice.
I need to sit. No problem. Okay, okay.
Okay.
Rub her hands.
-Is she gonna be okay? -Yes, she's gonna be fine.
Keep them warm. Keep them warm.
You're doing okay. You're doing okay.
Let her rest, it's fine. It's okay.
-It's okay. -Daddy!
Leave my daddy alone!
[Lucy] Daddy, I'm scared.
[Peter] Just stay there.
Why are you here?
You want to hurt my family?
Is that what you want? You want to hurt my family?
What...
Who are you?
Why are you doing this?
[Hanna] Mom?
Mom?
She-- she won't wake up!
Mom, wake up! Mom!
-[Lucy] Say something! -[Hanna] Mom!
-Mom, come on, wake up! -Daddy, help!
Mommy! Let's get her up. Let's get Mommy up.
Girls, get behind me.
Get behind me, girls. Get behind me. Lucy, get behind me.
Pick her up.
Do you understand me?
Pick her up right now.
Pick her up right now. And I want you to move slow.
Hello?
Hello?
-[bangs on door] -Hello?
Maybe one of the other doors.
Mom needs help now.
No, no.
-Oh, here, here. -Here. Move!
No, no, no! Please, please! Please, no, no!
No, no, no, please.
That's my wife, she's in bad shape. We need help.
Peter?
-David. -[man] Hold up, hold up!
-Hey. -You got one.
Alice, she's in bad shape right now, she needs help right away.
Hey, gurney! Right now!
[man] Yes, sir!
Coming through.
She was hit on the left side really bad.
Any other injuries?
-Not that I... -[Hanna] Dad!
They're coming.
[David] Everybody, inside, now!
[woman] Hold her steady. Go ahead.
-Scan her. -You got to stop the bleeding.
What is that?
-Stop! -Stop it!
Wait, what are you doing?
It's okay. It's a diagnostic.
He knows what he's doing.
[Peter] Stop! I said stop! Don't touch her! Stop!
-[Hanna] You're hurting her! -I told you to stop!
-Everybody just calm down. -What the hell's going on?
[David] We're all friends here, all right?
[Lucy] Mommy! Stop it!
Why does it feel like you're prepared for this?
What's happening out there has been headed our way for a long time.
But right now, let's please focus on your wife
and getting you and your family to safety.
Please.
There's an abandoned train station below us.
Headed to an underground base where we've been stockpiling weapons.
-What happened to all the storage? -Sent ahead. We'll be safe.
They'll never find us.
Once we're there, we'll finalize our plan to fight back.
But I'm not a soldier.
You'd be surprised what you're capable of.
They're directly above us. -They're gonna get through. -[loud thud, screaming]
Okay. Prepare for a breach and get everyone downstairs now.
-Yes, sir. -Get rid of him.
-Take him out back and kill him. -It's your wife...
The damage is way beyond our ability to repair.
If she can make it through the evacuation, she might have a chance,
but her system's shutting down.
-There's nothing we can do. -There's gotta be a way to help her.
-I'm sorry, we don't have the equipment. -Wait! No, no!
-You can't quit on Mom. -Nobody's quitting on Mom.
Hey, I can help her! I can help her!
I can help her, man! I can keep her going!
-What? -I can keep her alive, keep her going!
You can keep her going?
-You trying to play games with me? -I'm not.
You our enemy? The medic said he can't help her, and you can?
I can keep her going long enough to get help.
-Why should I believe you? -He's lying.
-We have to go. -It's not true.
I had to learn everything about your people, all right? There's ways.
There's no time. We have to evacuate right now. Get him out of here!
-Go! -I know what to do!
-Let's go! -Let me help!
Okay, stop, stop! Stop!
Okay, girls, girls.
Okay, you have to listen to me. You have to listen, okay?
-You're going with David. -No!
I'm gonna stay with Mom until she's good,
and then I'm gonna join you guys, I promise. We'll meet you at the train.
Okay.
[David] The evacuation transport is downstairs.
-We'll hold as long as we can. -Okay.
Girls, girls, girls, please, please.
-Know that I love you, okay? -No!
[distorted] Dad!
No!
-Stop! -Daddy! Dad!
You got time?
[man 1] Move, move!
[man 2] All the way down the back. Let's go!
Give me a knife and bring those lights over here.
Stop.
Here you go.
All right.
Hey! Easy! Easy, easy, please!
-Easy! -You want me to do this?
I'm trying to help you!
All right.
Oh, shit.
They're right, it's bad.
What is that? What is that?
What's in her?
What is that? What is in her?
You really don't know what... you are?
Look, if you want to save her life,
she's gonna need an alternative source of power.
I'm talking about you.
[Lucy] Hanna!
I lost Herman!
Okay.
Put the... put the knife down.
And...
go over there.
Okay. All right, what do I do?
You got to...
You got to make an incision... on your chest,
at a sideways edge.
Okay.
Okay.
Start at the top.
Just make a straight line, about six inches across.
I should warn you...
if this doesn't work...
the current will split and...
then you're both dead.
Let's do it.
[man] Synthetics will take over the world. A.I. will take over the world.
Does that not scare you, that they're starting to wake up to the idea
that they were designed to serve us?
We are not God, but we are their god
because we created them and that makes us their god.
And that gives us the right to do with them whatever we want to.
If we want to shut them down, we can shut them down.
[woman] Genocides have always been about one race thinking they're better.
What makes us better than the synthetics?
[man] The previous genocides in history were against human beings,
not against created objects, not against can openers.
Pick up your shit, you stupid synth!
[man] The late Stephen Hawking,
he said that A.I. would be the downfall of mankind.
I mean, does that not terrify you?
Are they not starting to exhibit lifelike tendencies
that would compel them to wonder why they were built in the first place?
Why did you do that?
I don't know.
[crowd chanting] You will not replace us!
You will not replace us!
[man] So what's next? Welfare payments? The right to marry?
Where does it stop?
They're taking our jobs, endangering our lives.
Just last week, a synthetic hospitalized a human.
[woman] It was self-defense. It's well-reported, a group of humans attacked a synthetic
with no provocation at all.
[crowd] You will not replace us!
-You will not replace us! -What's going to happen to us?
You will not replace us!
[man] Fighting, defensive or otherwise, is the result of emotion.
If they're beginning to experience any emotion,
the ultimate consequence will be devastating for society.
We need to round them up and shut them down
by any means necessary!
Alice!
-They sent the military? -The decommission has started.
-They want to wipe us out. -[gunfire]
We got to get out of here.
-[man] They're coming! -Okay.
[Alice] No!
[Alice] Enough!
I'm sorry. I had to do it.
I know. I know.
Here, take it. You have to defend yourself.
[man over PA] All units, report to your nearest marked shuttle station.
Planet evacuation in progress.
All units, report to your nearest marked shuttle station.

All units, report to your nearest marked shuttle station.
Planet evacuation in progress.
Sweep's clean, no humans.
All right, everyone fall out.
Head back to your posts.
[Peter] That's gotta be the last of them.
They'll be back.
Never trust a human to just let things be.
Some of us are gonna have to stay ready.
I'll meet you back at the factory.
We should go.
Wait.
Hey.
Come here.
-Whoa. -Hey, hey.
[Hanna] Leave us alone.
I'll shoot you.
It's okay.
It's okay. We're the same as you.
We're the same as you.
Hey...
it's okay.
Give me the gun.
Just give me the gun.
It's okay.
Here I go.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Are you guys here alone?
They killed Mom and Dad because they were human.
[woman] You'll no longer have to live in fear.
The memories of the past will be replaced.
And you will be a family.
[Peter] Alice.
[human] Careful.
The cord's the only thing keeping her alive right now.
Okay, she's... she's breathing better, that's good.
-That's good. -Wouldn't call it "breathing."
It worked.
I don't know how long it'll hold up, but...
It worked.
I remember...
the-- the war.
You guys tried to wipe us out.
We chose to forget.
Must be nice...
picking what memories you can keep.
Humans don't have that luxury.
Why are you helping us?
You could have killed us when I was passed out.
It was my grandparents you chased off the planet.
I wasn't even born yet.
It was like 50 years ago.
We've been living in colonies on Mars since.
None of us had even been to Earth before.
We didn't know what to expect.
Didn't even know if we could still breathe down here.
We did learn everything about you...
the synthetics.
How you drove us from our homes and left us with nothing.
It took us all this time just to gather the resources we needed to come back.
They told us you were monsters.
Savages.
It's kind of just one side of the story.
I know that now.
So why am I helping you?
'Cause no one said I'd be coming down here killing kids...
and families.
It's not what I signed up for.
Peter.
Baby! Baby?
-Hey, you're doing well. -I saw...
I saw... I--I saw...
I saw... I...
Your dreams... it's the past.
It's our past.
-The dreams. -Yeah.
Those girls... the girls!
No, no, they're waiting for us.
Proceed to the platform in an orderly fashion, please,
and board the train.
We can't wait any longer. As soon as David gets here, we're gone.
Last train!
Move, move, move!
-Lucy, come on. -Not without Mommy and Daddy!
-Come on. -They'll be here! Daddy said that!
[man over PA] This is a Level Three mandatory evacuation.
Follow evacuation protocol.
Proceed to the platform in an orderly fashion, please,
and board the train.
You guys got to hide.
I'll tell them I'm alone when they get in here, but...
-I don't know, it's your only shot. -We gotta get back to the girls.
All right.
Come on.
It's okay.
All right.
You all right?
I'm-- I'm Peter.
Miles.
Here. You know what? Here.
It was never mine to begin with, but thank you.
Are you guys okay?
-Yes. -Yeah, yeah.
Okay, stay tight and low. Cover, now! Go, go, go!
-Move! -Go!
Go, go, go!
Quickly! Go, go!
[man] Cover us! Cover us!
I'll cover you!
[Alice] Go for the tunnel. I'll cover you.
Go. Go!
Come on!
How will they get in?
Come on!
[Alice] Cover me!
Okay, look.
I need you girls to get onto the transport now.
-We have to wait. -Please!
They'll be here.
-No! -Get off me!
-Stop! Please! -No!
[Lucy] Let me go!
[Alice] Come on.
Come on, this way.
Wait! Wait!
Stop, stop! Hey!
-Come on. Come on. -Wait!
-Wait. -Wait!
Hanna!
Lucy!
-Mommy! -Hey!
Daddy!
-Come on! -Come on, come on!
I knew you'd save her.
Be right back.
Come here.
Come here.
You remember?
Yeah.
Do they?
[David] Like you,
they had their memories wiped...
to start clean...
without fear,
free of the guilt of...
what we had to do...
just to be free.
A few of us like me kept our memories, so we could prepare for this day.
But now they're all gonna have to remember,
'cause this...
this is not over.
We'll be safe at our underground base for now.
There, we'll finalize our plans to take back home.
So be ready.
I thought I lost you.
Sorry that I didn't believe you.
[Peter] Our world...
keeps moving...
changing...
evolving...
and so do we.
I know who I am now...
and I know my enemy.
We're not that different.
Maybe...
and love each other through thick and thin and it all ends happily ever after...
this isn't the film for you, okay?
This is my city. I've seen it all.
Look at 'em. Boring people living boring lives.
I'm not judging.
Yeah, I am.
I've stared into a lot of windows, okay?
I've seen happy families, supportive families, functional families. Ugh.
But the best stories are always in the windows where nobody looks.
No, look down.
There they are. Hidden.
I'm the narrator, by the way.
And a cat. Get over it, yeah?
This family's story is weird, you know,
This family's story is weird, you know, hidden away from the modern world in their old-fashioned home.
I'll show you around. Fantastic mouse hunting here.
When I say "old-fashioned," I mean they go back a long way.
A family legacy of tradition, invention, creativity and courage.
Their greatness passed down like their magnificent facial hair
from generation to generation to generation.
Until this one.
-I so love being a Willoughby with you. -Oh, smoopsy buns. I'm so happy!
-I so love being a Willoughby with you. -Oh, smoopsy buns. I'm so happy! -[man purring] -[woman laughing]
Let's jump ahead a few months,
when this loving and perfect marriage produced...
-[splattering] -[baby wailing] Well, you know.
-[woman] What is that? -[man] Oh, dear.
I'm your father,
and that sweet woman that you insulted with your rude birth is Mother.
If you need love, I beg of you, find it elsewhere. Thank you.
Oh, you are Tim,
-and you are a Willoughby. -[cooing]
Good day, sir.
[The Cat] His loving parents had no love left over for Tim.
All they gave him was his name.
[voice echoing] Willoughby.
Oh. Willough... [humming] ...by.
[The Cat] Oh, and siblings.
-A sister named Jane... -[Jane humming]
-[shushes] Our parents will hear you! -[sighs]
[The Cat] ...and twin brothers, both named Barnaby. They're creepy.
-Thanks, Barnaby. -You're welcome, Barnaby.
[Jane] Why are we staring at this wall? [Tim] Because, Jane, we are Willoughbys.
[The Cat] Okay, this Willoughby story is odd, all right?
But it's not all bad. At least they ate every family meal together.
And by "they," I mean these two.
-You like it spicy, don't you? -Oh, I don't just like it...
I loaf it.
[The Cat] They just forgot to share with their kids.
I do not predict leftovers.
But I'm so hungry I just want to eat my own tongue.
-Me, too. -Me, too.
[both] Us, too.
What if we dress a Barnaby up like food--
-Bad idea. -Terrible idea.
No, Jane.
Okay, then, what if I go? -Stop what if-ing! -[Barnaby A] Yeah.
[Barnaby B] No what-ifs.
I know you're hungry, but Willoughbys do not beg for food.
-[Mother and Father giggling] -We wait.
May we have food?
-Food? -We eat today's food.
You eat yesterday's food.
But you ate all of yesterday's food yesterday.
So there is no food left over for... Jane!
Huh? My name is Mother. Who is this Jane?
You call your mother names, and you expect us to feed you?
-No, no, no. -[Mother] No?
I mean... [laughs nervously] Yes, Mother. Don't!
Don't? You do not tell your mother what to do not do!
You do not tell your mother what to do not do!
-You selfish boy. You ate it all. -No, I didn't!
Oh, Father, I'm going to starve. [whimpers]
-[screams] -It's that girl!
-She brought the small one. -They are creepy.
[both] Hi, Mommy.
What are they doing here?
-Nothing. -[Barnabys] Bye, Mommy!
-They're, uh, going... -Hungry.
These children, always wanting. -We're fine. Jane! -The Barnabys could use another sweater.
-We're fine. Jane! -The Barnabys could use another sweater.
-One's good. -We like one.
-[whispers] Barnabys! -You want two. [shushes] Stop talking.
-Look at me, I'm fretting. -Dreadful.
-I'm all a-fret. -Appalling.
-I can't knit! -This is all your fault!
-I can't knit! -This is all your fault! My fault? Wha--
Son, you insist on bothering us with your childish needs.
Go to the coal bin!
Good day, sir.
[The Cat] Poor Timothy.
That's a rotten place for a hairless kid in short trousers, innit?
[sigh] Sometimes, I wish I wasn't a Willoughby.
We used to be great.
We were soldiers and scientists, kings and philosophers,
explorers and aviators, artists and poets!
explorers and aviators, artists and poets! We climbed the unclimbable,
and we always ate together... at tables, like a family,
where every Willoughby had a mustache, even the women.
We could be great again.
No...
We will be.
Against all odds, the Willoughby children still had determination...
-Nice job, Barnaby. -You, too, Barnaby.
[both] Bye-bye, dirigible!
[The Cat] ...imagination...
and hope.

Not without a little help.
Maybe it was the dark and stormy night, maybe I've looked in one too many windows,
Maybe it was the dark and stormy night, maybe I've looked in one too many windows, but this story got to me.
I know, narrators aren't supposed to get involved, but just a little nudge.
A well-timed cat's...
-Something's outside. -Definitely something outside.
-Jane. -There's something outside.
That's a yowl. A beastly yowl.
Wow! What a mystery. It's like we're in a book.
Wow! What a mystery. It's like we're in a book. -Come on, Barnabys. -[Barnaby A] Bad book.
-[Barnaby B] Scary book! -[grunts]
Shh! They're still awake.
-Dance, dance for your papa. -[giggling]
What kind of a beast yowls like that?
I'm really scared. Are you scared, Barnabys? 'Cause I'm scared.
I'm really scared. Are you scared, Barnabys? 'Cause I'm scared. Maybe we shouldn't--
Do you remember that book about beasts with all the drawings of teeth and claws and huge piles of half-eaten kids?
-Don't. -Stop talking.
[Jane] It was a lot of blood, wasn't it, Barnabys?
-Blood is bad. -I'm gonna have a quick look -to see if it's dangerous. -[yowling continues]
If it is, run. Different directions, zigzaggy and stuff.
-So it can only eat one of you. -What's this feeling I'm feeling?
-Fear. Fear. -Definitely fear.
-[creature yowls] -Remember, twins, zigzaggy.
[Barnabys] Zigzag. Zigzag. Zigzag.
[Jane grunting] Stand back, Barnabys.
[The Cat] I know what you're thinking, 'cause I'm thinking exactly the same thing:
What's in the box?
And can we empty it so I can sit in it?
Hi, beast. I'm Jane.
I hope you're a nice beast because, um, we're nice.
Please don't eat our faces.
[Mother] Father, I love the smell of fresh yarn in the morning.
-[Father barks] -Gah! Parents already up? Despicable!
[Mother] Harvesting your mustache makes such lovely yarn.
-[barks] -Do it!
-[Mother] Mmm-hmm. -Ugh. How am I gonna get by? -[Mother] Keep going. -[Tim grunts]
I knit, you provide. It's simple.
-[gasps] Was that always... -[barks]
Oh! You want Mother to have yarn, don't you?
You must. You like the sweaters.
-[squawks] -Oh, pretty!
There you go. Phew.
Jane? Twins?
[gasps] Great Uncle Edmund! Shh!
-[creature laughs] -They'll hear you.
We must be quiet while Mother and Father are still--
-Tim! -[yelps and groans]
[clicking tongue] Here beastie, beastie, beastie. -Jane! What are you-- -[Barnaby A] Over there.
[Barnaby B] Catch it.
-Get it! -Get it!
Are you harboring a raccoon again?
-Pfft. No. -[creature yowls]
[Tim] That is something!
Is it more of a some or more of a thing?
-[Barnaby] Get it! -What is that?
-Aw! -A baby!
-No thumping! -I can't knit!
[softly] Where did you get that thing?
We found her outside, living in a box. She's an orphan.
-Smells like an orphan. -Looks like an orphan.
Got a box like an orphan. ♪ Orphan friend, box all alone ♪
♪ Orphan friend, box all alone ♪ -Why are you singing? -♪ We're glad you came here-- ♪

Jane! You know our parents hate children,
and babies are the most childish children of all!
Well, I love her and nobody's gonna take her away from me.
-Barnabys, bring it to me. -[both] Yes, Tim.
Hey! Barnabys, give me back my orphan. -[both] You got it, Jane. -Barnabys, thing.
-[both] You got it, Jane. -Barnabys, thing.
-[both] Sorry, Tim. -Barnabys, orphan.
-[both] Sorry, Tim. -Barnabys, orphan. -[both] Yes, Jane. -Ah, Barnabys.
-[both] You got it, Tim. -Barnabys. -Barnabys. Barnabys. -Barnabys. Barnabys.

-Got away. -Pretty fast.
-What? -[baby yowling]
The beast is loose!
Oh, no, no, no!
-What is it? -A baby.
Oh, not again.
-Why does this keep happening, Mother? -[Tim] Parents!
How are you... Oh. Parents, I got this. I got this.
-Stay. -[baby yowls] [Tim] Do not move a baby muscle.
-[baby yowls] -[yells] Get it off. Get it off. Get it off! Get it off!
-Ooh. -Roasted baby. No!
-Mother's balls are burning. -No.
-Yes. -[grunts]

-[cooing] -Barnabys, catch her.
No, no, no. Oh!
-Gotcha, you little rascal. -[Barnabys gasp]
-Oh. -[baby whimpers] -It's not even a Willoughby. -Is this thing yours?
-No. -What? No, I didn't...
You eat our food, sleep in our coal bin
and now you expect us to rear another child?
-He's always doing this. -What? No.
-I mean, we've tried everything. -Ignored him.
-I mean, we've tried everything. -Ignored him. -Coal bin. -Neglected him.

Nope! Nothing works.
-[baby giggles] -I can't knit!
Oh, Mother, sweet. [shushing]
-Children. -I wish we could kick them all out.
-I've decided to kick you all out! -Do it, Father.
But my home!
Do not return till that thing is gone!
-You are... -Do it. Do it.
-You are... -Do it. Do it. -...punished! -Yes!
-This is all your fault! -What? It's their fault.
-This is all your fault! -What? It's their fault. We should kick them out.
How will we restore honor to House Willoughby
if we are not living in the Willoughby house?
-Ugh. But-- -We have to get rid of it, fast. [Jane] No, Tim!
Oh, the ordeal is over. Let us return to our home.
-[squeals] -What? What? How!
Tim, she needs a home, and if we don't help her,
Tim, she needs a home, and if we don't help her, we're as bad as our parents,
who keep sullying our great Willoughby name.
They have sullied it so much. [yelps]
I know where we can find the perfect home. Follow me.
-[Barnaby A] Whoo-hoo! -[Barnaby B] Hello, outside!
-[Barnaby A] Whoo-hoo! -[Barnaby B] Hello, outside! Outside? But... [whimpering] I've never...
Outside? But... [whimpering] I've never...
[The Cat] I guess it's hard to leave home for the first time.
Although, I was six days old when I left.
All my folks ever did for me was lick my eyeballs open, sent me packin'.
He'll be all right. Maybe.
-Jane! Where are we going? -To the end of the rainbow.
-Jane! Where are we going? -To the end of the rainbow. End of the rainbow? How far is that?
End of the rainbow? How far is that?
Not far. Right, orphan friend?
[automated voice] Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Walk.
-[Barnabys] Ooh! -[Tim] Barnabys!
[Jane] Excuse me. Coming through. Yep, sorry.
[Tim] Excuse me, excuse me. Jane, the people! The people!
This way.
-[horn honking] -[yelps] Wait for me! -[shrieks] -[horn honking]
-[gasps] Yes! Over here. -[baby squeals]
[Tim] Jane! I got pee in my shoes.
Are we getting close?
-[sighs] -[Jane] We're almost there.
This looks like the bad part of town.
Self-taught.
-[all gasping] -Look at that.
Isn't it wonderful? The perfect home.
[The Cat] Usually in old-fashioned stories,
rainbows have treasure at the end, don't they?
Not this one.
"No trespassing"? Well, that's a bust.
-Look! Duckies! -Jane.
-[Barnaby] Factory! -Barnabys!
-[Jane and Barnabys laughing] -No!
-[Jane] Hi, duckies! They're so chubby! -[quacking]
-[Tim] Barnabys! Jane! -[Barnabys and Jane giggling]
[Tim] Willoughbys do not trespass!
-[Jane] The perfect home. Yay! -[Barnabys giggling]
-[Barnaby A] It's a candy factory! -[Barnaby B] So many machines.
[Barnaby A] So many buttons.
-Levers. Levers. Levers. -Buttons. Buttons. Buttons.

Rainbow food? This place has everything.
-Hey! -Orphan has a home. We go home.
We can't just leave her outside. It's not safe.
What if there are... wolves?
Wolves?
-[duck quacking] -[Tim] Here.
You found her in a box? We leave her in a box.
-Wolves do hate boxes. -Balance restored.
Um, uh... Tim, wait!
What if we gave her a name? A proper three-syllable name, like, uh... oh, Taffeta!
T-A-F-F-E--
Hey!
-Her name is Ruth. -[Jane] Ruth?
Yes. Because re-orphaning her makes us the ruthless Willoughbys.
Now be ruthless and say goodbye.
Okay.
[sighs] Oh, Ruth.
I'll always know where to find you. At the end of the rainbow.
-[Ruth babbles] -To home!
-[doorbell rings] -Jane!
[man angrily] Who disturbs my work?
[exclaims] We're trespassing!
Who--
What is in my box?
Ruth? You're not candy.
Such a magnificent mustache. This is the perfect home.
I really hope we're doing the right thing.
Of course we are, Jane.
A great man with a great home must have a great family.
Just imagine what that lucky orphan's life will be like.
Ugh. I wish we had a home like Ruth,
where we didn't have to steal food and nobody would say, "Shut up, Jane!"
Oh, we would eat at a table like the great Willoughbys of old.
Our mustaches would grow long,
and no one would ever have to go to the coal bin again...
unless they wanted coal.
-I want a factory. -Big factory.
Wait. We could have all of that.
-[all gasp] -Except for the factory.
-[Barnabys groan] -How? What if we became orphans?
[scoffs] That is your iffiest what-if yet. We have parents.
-Bad parents. -Terrible parents.
But what if we didn't? It's like in the books.
Pollyanna's died of cholera in India.
James, that peach fellow's parents were eaten by a hippo.
I thought it was a rhinoceros.
Think about how great our family could be if they were gone.
Jane, are you seriously suggesting--
We orphan ourselves. Yes!
-Ghastly! -Ruthless. [cackles]
No! Getting rid of an orphan is one thing.
How do you propose we discard of two insidious grown-ups?
Easy.
-No! -No. Not there. There.
-[screams] No! -[Jane] No. There.
Wha...
...$999, and all your troubles will be gone for good.
-You'll love it. -Gone for good?
A folded piece of shiny paper?
We can send them away. What if we orphaned ourselves?
Yeah. Cracking idea, Tim.
To home! [grunts and yells]
[The Cat] I love this plan.
Okay, humans, calm down. Don't get all sensitive.
"Ooh! This is bad." It's nature. It'll work out.
Look, these kids needed a change. Y'know?
I did warn you this story wasn't all fluffy and fuzzy.
Oh, blimey, those are sharp scissors. Watch the eyes!
We shall craft a murderous adventure
that gives our insidious parents exactly what they want.
-To be left alone with their love. -[meows]
Precisely. A romantic getaway, hiding deadly orphaning opportunities.
If they do not melt in the hottest places on Earth...
[Tim] ...they shall drown in the wettest.
Cannibals will feast unless they freeze in glacial ice,
or dissolve in fields of acid first.
[Tim] They shall not escape the bears, but if they do,
[Tim] They shall not escape the bears, but if they do, we have saved the deadliest spot for last...
the Unclimbable Alp...
-in Sveetzerlünd. -[gasps]
[all] He who goes up does not come down.
The Reprehensible Travel Agency.
No children allowed.
-Behold! -Wow.
Ah. Exquisite.
-What? -Hmm?
-Father. -Yes, poopsie.
What is it?
-Hmm. -What does it say, Fatherkins?
-"See the world." -See the world?
"Have adventures."
[sing-song] I'd love to have an adventure!
-You know what else, Mother? -What, Father?
No children allowed! [chuckles]
I would love that. [giggles]
Do the hula, my love. [purring]
You make me spin whirlybird style.
No. Stop. Wait.
If we leave these children here alone, they'll ruin everything.
What if we didn't leave them here alone? Huh?
We could get them a nanny.
But aren't good nannies expensive?
Yes, Mother. So we'll hire a not-good nanny for cheap.
[The Cat] To adventure. Are they gullible or what?
I mean, I never thought they'd fall for it. Did you?
Oh, you are my muse, flipsy-poop. Mmm.
[sighs] Now that's gonna be a fun ride.
-Go on, pick me up. -[grunts]
Put me in sideways.
[Father] Mother's been friends with her fork.
[The Cat] Well, that was easy.
-[Father laughing] To adventure! -[Mother] Ooh!
[The Cat] Everyone got what they wanted. [Mother] To adventure!
-[horns honking] -[The Cat] All good.
Told you this would work out.
They're gone? We did it.
-We... -Are...
-[both] Orphans! -[exclaims]
[sing-song] Orphan home. Orphan home.
You are punished!
Great Edmund, enjoy thy wall.
[voice echoing] Willoughby...
[Edmund] Timothy, you are the man of the house!
With great responsibility comes great mustache.
[overlapping voices] Tim, Tim, Tim...
Tim, Tim, Tim.
Tim, Tim, Tim. -[Jane] Tim. -[yells]
-[panting] -[Jane] Tim!
-Tim! -[yells] Is it morning?
-We're hungry. -Haven't eaten in hours.
-Days. Starving. -What's food?
I hear your childish needs, and as man of the house, I will provide.
[The Cat] See? Told you this would all work out.
Let the greatness begin.
[The Cat] Oh, Tim.
Warm thy Willoughby self.
Simply divine.
[mimicking Edmund] Dinner is served!
A proper meal for a proper family.
Delicious lobster on a bed of coal! Ta-da!
Tim, is that from the wall?
-Old lobster. -Really old.
[mimicking Edmund] Old food is the best food.
I'm going.
What? You're skipping the cheese plate?
Charcuterie mouse!
-This is getting weird. -I pass.
[The Cat] I'll eat it.
What? Hey!
Where the Willoughby are you going?
Out. Ruth has rainbow food at her place and--
We did not orphan ourselves so you could go toodle-doodling,
eating fancy rainbow food with your friends.
I am an orphan and I do what I want.
-No, you can't. -I can.
-You shan't. -I shan!
-No, you-- -Hello!
-Stranger. -Danger.
[muffled] Trespasser!
Fear not, skinny orange boy, for I am your nanny!
[muffled] No, I'm in charge!
I've read about nannies. What kind of nanny are you?
Did you fly in on the east wind or the west?
-West. -Where's your umbrella?
-Here. -Do you eat children?
-Sometimes. -Why are you here?
I was hired by your loving parents.
-[Barnabys gasp] -Loving? [muffled] Parents?
I've got no qualifications, but a cheery disposition.
Here to service all your childish needs. I cook, clean... [sing-song] sing!
What? You sing?
-Yeah! All nannies sing. -I sing, too.
[gasps] What if we sing together? Yeah!
Everybody, come on!
Never trust a nanny.
-[gasps] This is amazing. -Yay!
-Insidious! -[Jane] I love it!
[Barnaby A] What is she doing to Jane's head? -[Barnaby B] Now it's pointy. -[Barnaby A] And she looks younger.
-[Barnaby B] Now it's pointy. -[Barnaby A] And she looks younger.
[Barnaby B] Devil woman.
-We have to get rid of her. -[Barnabys] Rid of her?
-Fast. -[Barnabys] Ooh.
Nanny is working for our parents, and now she's brainwashed Jane.
She has to go. But how? Perhaps another brochure.
-How about this, Tim? -It'll work.
[Tim] What the Willoughby is that?
-[Barnaby] It's a nannapult, Tim. -Nannapult?
Nanny goes here, in the nanny-cup.
[both] Lever.
-Nanny gone. -Problem solved.
Whoa! This is... a terrible idea.
This is... a terrible idea.
First off, too many levers.
Do you honestly think she's just gonna walk right in here
Do you honestly think she's just gonna walk right in here and plop herself down in your nanny-cup?
-[Nanny laughs] -[yelps] [Jane] This is the library.
The twins mostly do stuff here.
[gasps] Wow. Did you little mushroom heads make this?
[gasps] A bouncy chair?
-Whoa, it looks like a nanny-cup. -Bouncy... [giggles]
You guys are like little baby Albert Einsteins but with weirder hair.
-What are your names? -[whispers] Lever.
-That's Barnaby. -And that's Barnaby.
-Both of you? Okay. -[whispers] Pull it.
What if I call you Barnaby A?
-[whispers] Do it! -And you're Barnaby B?
-Lever! -I can tell them apart now.
-I like B. -I like A.
-I love all the levers! Or is it leaver? -No, no, no.
-Lever. -No, leaver.
Can I pull it?
Whoa! Fun. Ooh, what's this one do?
-Nothing, huh? -[Tim groans in distance]
-Who's hungry? -[all] Yay!
Not great. Oh, look at them over there, chewing food in their mouths,
-eating it up. Ugh! -[Nanny] Skinny Bones?
-What's his deal? -Jealous.
-What's his deal? -Jealous. -Definitely jealous. -Yeah. It's a classic power struggle.
-Definitely jealous. -Yeah. It's a classic power struggle.
Traitorous Willoughbys. More like Will-not-be's.
[mocking] Will not eat Tim's food.
-Hey, Tim. -[yelps]
I know you miss your old-fashioned parents.
Change is hard. I've been there. I think maybe you just need to eat.
-What? No, no, no. -[Nanny] Come on. Here we go.
-Hmm. -Put some oats on those skinny bones.
Tim, you have to try this. It's so good. Way better than that wall lobster.
[exclaims] Willoughbys do not eat oats.
I know you can do this, Skinny Bones. Now eat.
No, thank you.
-Eat. -Nope.
-Eat. -Nope. -Eat. -No.
-[Nanny] Stop it. -You stop it.
-[Nanny] Let go. -You let go.
-Eat. -No! [gasps]
You disrespect my oats, you disrespect me.
I have no choice but to put you in...
The coal bin? I was gonna say time-out.
You know, I have no choice but to put you in a time-out.
Why in the world would your parents ever put you in a coal bin?
Having childish needs. -Like food. -Sweaters.
Love.
Oh, taking in an orphan.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You took in an orphan?
Yeah, we did. [sighs]
But she was a baby, and babies are the most childish children, so...
We got rid of her.
What? Back up the abuse caboose. Where'd you get rid of a baby?
[Jane] The perfect home.
Oh, this is the worst home ever. Poor little orphan.
We should not be trespassing. Disturbing this great man's work.
[scoffs] What great man?
-[doorbell rings] -[man angrily] Who disturbs my work? -[Nanny screams] -[gasps]
Wait a minute. Commander Melanoff is real?
Um, yes. [chuckles] Wow. That is a... That's a strong fashion choice.
[chuckles] Wow. That is a... That's a strong fashion choice.
-Do you dress like that every day, sir? -I, uh...
-Are those medals candy? -Uh, maybe.
-Can Ruth come out? -No! Go away!
-Hey! Hey! Where's the orphan, candy man? -Shh.
-[grunts] No! -Baby!
-Ruth! -[Barnabys] Factory!
-[Tim yells] -[grunts] Oh, diddly-do.
-May I touch your mustache? -What? -[Ruth crying] -Uh-oh.
-Baby? Where is she? -[Jane] Ruth!
[Nanny] This is bad.
We have to get her before she has a sugar crash.
Oh, no, no, no. Not again. You trespassers! Stay!
Yes, great one.
[Nanny] Oh, baby. No, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, diddly-doodle. [grunts]
Ah! Not the candy crusher.
[gasps] Ruthie!
Gotcha! [grunts]
-Ooh, that was exciting. -Okay, but we're supposed to be staying.
[Jane squeals and laughs] Ruth! You! Big-haired lady. [grunts] Give me back my baby!
You! Big-haired lady. [grunts] Give me back my baby!
Your baby? I don't think so, sugar daddy.
A nanny knows things,
and this nanny knows these messed-up Willoughbys left a baby on your doorstep.
Wait, are you the angels who brought her to me?
-[Jane] Uh... -Maybe.
I wouldn't call them angels, exactly.
-Oh, my. -What are you feeding her?
Candy! I'm Commander Melanoff, and I live in the land of fun!
-Whoa. -A moving painting?
How did they get the tiny people in the box?
[Melanoff] Ruthie likes it, don't ya? You like those toasty oats.
All kids love oats.
So, you're like the real Commander Melanoff? You're famous?
Well, maybe. [laughs] I do make every tasty treat myself.
Do you live here alone, or...
Yes. Well, I did.
Ruth moved in and she needs a lot of attention.
'Course she does, don't you, baby girl?
How could something so tiny make so much poop?
-I haven't slept in nine days. -Oh, that explains a lot.
-I haven't slept in nine days. -Oh, that explains a lot. I called Orphan Services for help, but--
Orphan Services? No, you shouldn't have called them!
Orphan Services? No, you shouldn't have called them! Well, I mean, "Find an orphan you don't know, call--"
Well, I mean, "Find an orphan you don't know, call--"
-Oh, oh. -Oh, oh.
No. Giving a baby to them is like locking a puppy up in a cage.
Oh, my! I love puppies.
It's a good thing I hung up, then.
Oh, you did? You see, I've grown fond of her childish needs.
You see, I've grown fond of her childish needs.
I want her to stay.
-[coos and giggles] -[Nanny] Okay, but... This factory isn't baby proofed.
She can't just eat candy for the rest of her life.
I mean, next thing you know, she's going off to college, she could...
I mean, next thing you know, she's going off to college, she could... She could be a doctor. Maybe she'll write the next Moby Dick,
She could be a doctor. Maybe she'll write the next Moby Dick,
or paint the next Mona Lisa. Fly an airplane to the moon.
I mean, she could be the next president.
You know? And then you're gonna have to go to the White House
and maybe not wear a candy suit, you know? It's a lot.
That sounds sweet.
It's time for this candy man to become a family man,
-who also makes candy. -[Ruth cooing]
Well, if you ever need help, you know who to call.
Oh, the service for orphans.
What? No, Skinny Bones! [scoffs]
You could call me. You know, I'm a nanny.
-I will. -Just put your number in there.
-I will. -Just put your number in there. If you ever need a candy factory, or-- Ooh! [laughing]
Yay! The perfect home.
[laughing] Oh, you Willoughbys are wonderful.
Here, son, catch!
-[Tim whispers] Whoa. -[laughs]
-Is this a hug? -I don't know. But I like it.
Aww. Unfortunately, these Willoughby kids would soon get some disturbing news
that their parents were still alive.
They say that love conquers all. It does for these two.
[The Cat] How many lives have these cats got?
Oh, Father, I do so love adventuring with you.
-[purring] Oh! -Bug. Unfortunately, Mother, our adventuring is soon to be over. We are broke.
Unfortunately, Mother, our adventuring is soon to be over. We are broke.
[gasps] Does that mean we'll have to...
Ugh. Go home. I'm afraid so.
You mean, back to that old-fashioned home?
-Yes. -Oh!
If only there was a way that we could reach across time and space
-and just sell it. -[guide clears throat]
Uh, you could always use the Internet.
-Ina-- -Nets?
Uh, see here. Old-fashioned homes go for a lot these days. [chuckles]
-Oh, my. -[Mother giggles]
Piranhas!
-What in blue blazers is this thing? -[Mother] So many pictures.
Ooh. I get it.
[woman over phone] Irene Holmes.
Hello, we'd like to sell our old-fashioned house.
-Quickly. Tell her quickly. -Immediately.
[Jane singing] ♪ Riding a bus Taking us home ♪

-[Father over phone] Nanny... -[Nanny] Oh.
What? Father?
[Father] As you wish.
"Slide to unlock."
Okay, yeah.
[grunting] Why is it not work--
Yes!
-[Father] Nanny! We're selling the house. -Huh?
She's working for our still-alive parents!
-Tim, you're acting weird. -Oh, am I?
-Tim, you're acting weird. -Oh, am I? [Father] We're selling the house.
-Dispose of the children as you wish. -[Mother] Do it, Father.
[gasps] No.
Oh, yeah. And here's what that Nanny wrote back.
"As for the children... [menacingly] I will take care of them."
-Do you wanna be taken care of? -I do not.
-[vehicle approaches] -Oh, no.
[woman in sing-song] Money!
Another trespasser!
[woman] Money!
-Hello! [laughs] -[Tim yelps]
Open house tomorrow. I'm gonna sell your home.
[laughing] Money!
Oh, no, you won't.
[The Cat] Who could sleep on a night like this?
Well, I could, actually. I'm a great sleeper.
But these Willoughby kids can't.
[whispers] Go, go, go.
-Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. -[line dialing]
-[agent over phone] Orphan Services. -Oh, uh...
Hello, I'm an orphan in need of service.
I'd like to report a bad nanny.
Oh-oh.
-[indistinct chatter] -[Irene] Ding-dong!
The house is open! Buy it. Buy it. Buy it. Buy it.
[The Cat] Like mice nibbling at the edge of a trap,
these hopeful people were about to get caught in the war of the Willoughbys.
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
-[yelps] -Exquisite! [yelps]
[all] Hey.
-Yes! -[woman] Help!

Darn it!
Well done, Willoughbys. Today, we saved our home!

Whoa. Where you going? [laughs] [The Cat] ...they were no match for this.
Welcome. Right this way.
[man] Would you look at that house?
[The Cat] The perfect family.

It's like the Willoughby massacre of 1775--
[ominous voice] Trespassers!
-[girl] It's haunted! -[man shrieking]
-I love you! -[family crying]
-[Tim whimpers] -Something scared the perfect family?
-Beastly. -[Barnaby] Definitely a monster.
[Jane] We'll just take a look. Jane! No, no, no.
What happened to our library?
-[Barnaby A] I'm scared. -[Barnaby B] Definitely scared.
What the Willoughby?
I am the Willoughby beast. Enter my home and I shall feast!
I am the Willoughby beast. Enter my home and I shall feast! -[Tim yelps] -Eat one of the Barnabys.
-[Tim yelps] -Eat one of the Barnabys.
[Barnabys] Zigzag. Zigzag. Zigzag.
[beast] Leave this place and you be free, unless thou be a Willoughby!
Zigzag. Zigzag. It's not working. [whimpering]
[yells] I be a Willoughby.
[beast] Is that so?
Then I guess we're cool...
Skinny Bones.
Nanny?
Here to serve the little children.
-[Barnabys laughing] -Yay! I knew you were good.
Rubbery arms! But I locked you up in your room.
Oh, come on, Tim. All nannies know how to pick a lock.
Oh, come on, Tim. All nannies know how to pick a lock. [both] Ooh.
I was building this all night 'cause I really wanted to help.
Help who? Our parents? We can't trust her. Remember this, Nanny?
"As for the children,
[menacingly] I will take care of them."
Why are you being all evil? Hear it in my voice, okay?
As for the children, let me take care of them.
When you say it like that, I do wanna be taken care of.
Tim, I might work for your parents, but my duty is to look after you guys.
I should have told you they were selling the house.
I'm sorry.
But I just couldn't bear to break your weird little hearts.
Oh, thank you, Nanny. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Any time, tiny girlfriend.
-[Barnaby A] Wanna hug Nanny. -[Barnaby B] Huggy.
Get in here, you little mushroom heads.
-[Barnaby] Hug us will all six arms. -[kids sigh]
Tim, are you okay?
[Tim] Thank you.
Aww, Skinny Bones.
-[Tim gasps] -[Jane] What?
[woman over radio] Department of Orphan Services is on site.
-Unit 4. Cut off the exits. -Orphan Services? We have to go. Now!
-Unit 4. Cut off the exits. -Orphan Services? We have to go. Now! [woman] No children in or out.
Hurry, kids. Stick with me. Come on.
-[Tim] Where are we going? -Back door.
-No, follow me. Come on, you two. -Nanny, what's happening?
It's okay. Stay together. Come on. Come on. Don't panic. [gasps]
We have reason to believe a bad nanny is harboring orphans.
Orphans? As a Willoughby, I demand you leave our home.
As a Willoughby, I demand you leave our home.
You're the orphan. Yes.
No, no, no. They have parents. You leave them alone.
Linda? Is that you?
Uh, yeah.
-Linda? -But I'm a nanny now.
Are you wearing toilet paper again?
Yes, I am, but it--
Oh, you look ridiculous.
It's a costume. I was...
Once an orphan, always an orphan.
Nanny? You're an orphan?
No, I mean, I was. I mean... I...
[sighs] I am.
We tried to find her a home, but no one ever wanted her.
That's not true. We want her.
See? They want me.
Oh, Linda.
[Tim on recording] I'd like to report a bad nanny. We do not want her.
Tim?
That's you? Your voice?
-Tim. -How could you?
No, no-- Oh, children can be so, so cruel.
-I didn't mean-- -You did.
I was just trying to be a good nanny.
-But you are-- -No longer required.
-[Nanny crying] -No, you are required. Go, Linda, before these children hurt you more.
Go, Linda, before these children hurt you more.
Nanny, don't. Please!
Jane...
You did this.
I didn't mean--
You lied about Nanny. You made me get rid of Ruth.
That was our parents. -Always just bossing me around. -Jane--
-Always just bossing me around. -Jane-- You're a mean, mustacheless, short-panted--
You're a mean, mustacheless, short-panted-- -[groans] No! -Fighting children must be separated.
You can't.
[agent] For your own good. [Tim yells] No!
[agent] You will adopt standard childhood experiences.
Homes will be allocated. Schools will be assigned.
Until your biological parents return, you are officially orphans.
No!
[agent] Have a nice childhood.
[Jane] Stop! I don't want to go!
Help! I don't wanna go! Let me out! Let me out! [yells]
-[Barnaby A] Tim? -[Barnaby B] Jane?
[Tim] Please. You can't do this.
[woman over radio] All children collected and protected.
-No. -Good work, team.
These poor kids. Alone, scattered, lost.
Like me, really.
The Barnabys were cared for in a modern home,
plugged into the Internet, their little brains flooded with... Well, you've been on the Internet.
Well, you've been on the Internet.
Jane's hosts believed in the healing power of music.
[vocalizes] You okay, kiddo?
[The Cat] But Jane's song was gone.
Her what-ifs? No more.
Tim resisted change, running away from well-meaning families like the Wilsons,
the Walters,
the Waddingtons.
He wanted his old-fashioned Willoughby life back.
Sold? [gasps]
No, no, no, no!
[The Cat] But it was gone.
[The Cat] No home. No family. Someone's gotta look after him.
[woman over radio] This is unit three. We have him.
[The Cat] It's tough out there, in the city.
Sometimes, you're the cat. Sometimes, you're the mouse.
At least he's got a box.
Okay, it's a bit dark, but, uh, y'know.
Poor Nanny tucked her tail and ran away from her past.
Poor Nanny tucked her tail and ran away from her past. Y'know, never look back.
'Course, it's nobody's fault, really.
[The Cat] Fine. I'll stop the bus.
Happy now?
Let me off. Let me off! [grunts]
What the Willoughby?
[The Cat] This is good, right? Exciting.
-[cell door opens] -[guard] Oat time.
Hmph. Not hungry. [grunts]
[guard] Oh, I think you are, Skinny Bones.
Huh? What--
Hungry for freedom.
Nanny?
Call me Phil.
-[in deep voice] Get in the oat cart. -[meows]
I'm busting you out.
[sighs] I do not deserve this busting you speak of.
Leave me, Phil, to my short-panted guilt.
Oh, pity party, huh? Guess I didn't get my invitation.
Sure, you screwed up.
[sighs] I screwed up, too.
I left you kids there alone. I ran away.
But I came back,
and I'm not leaving here without a Willoughby.
I'm just a Will-not-be.
All I wanted was to be a great Willoughby with a great family.
-[Nanny grunts] -Hey! -Are you saying Jane's not great? -No!
-Barnaby A's not great? -No.
-Barnaby B's not great? -Ow!
-You're not great? -Okay, okay, I get it! Stop!
[sighs] Look, Skinny Bones, you have a family.
They need you and you need them.
My head protector.
[in deep voice] Let's blow this pop stand and do something great, bro-bro.
Let us get blowing, brother-brother.
[whispers] I admire your ruthlessness, but this is crazy.
Shh. Almost there.
[exclaims] I mean, uh, uh...
[in deep voice] Just taking the oats for a walk.
Oats love walking. Come on, oats.
-Is there an orphan in that cart? -Uh...
[agent] Phil?
Oh, boy, orphan in an oat cart? I've never heard of such a thing.
That's preposterous.
Uh, don't touch that.
Don't look in there.
[groans] Oh, my! My back!
How dare you?
You think oats grows in fields, Phil?
[scoffs] Do you know how long we have to soak these oats
so they're soft enough we won't choke a child?
Code Blue! She's not a real Phil!
-[gasps] It's Linda! -[yelps]
-Stop right there, fake Phil. -Nanny!
-Stop right there, fake Phil. -Nanny! -Tim? -Ow!
She's stealing an orphan.
He's not an orphan. And she's not a Linda.
-I'm Phil. -Phil this!
-I'm Phil. -Phil this! [grunts] Ow!
-[Nanny laughs] -Whoo-hoo!
Gotcha.
-She's getting away. Stop that Linda! -[yelps]
I knew Phil had a sweet car!
[yelps] Nanny, the gate!
Gate, schmate. Phil ain't no sheep.
[radio host] We have stories of people in very different contexts...
You know, it is nice to see Linda taking initiative.
[agent] Hmm.
[newscaster] Tonight, a skinny-boned boy escapes a juvenile detention center. The hunt for his--
Tim was in a box.
-[Tim] Barnabys. -[both gasp] I need your help.
-Okay, Tim. -Sure, Tim.
Let's go!
-Nope. -[Tim] No?
What do you mean, no? We have to hurry.
No need to hurry. We got the drums, baby. We got the drums.
Jane, please.
We're not the Willoughbys without your what-ifs.
What if... I say I am sorry?
What if you did?
What if you accept my apology?
What if you stop telling me what to do?
What if you stop getting me into trouble and stuck in a coal bin while you get to play with orphans and eat meatloaf?
and stuck in a coal bin while you get to play with orphans and eat meatloaf?
I accept your apology. -What? [groans] -Yay!
[singing] ♪ Tim says he's sorry ♪
♪ 'Cause he was wrong About all the things I'll list-- ♪
♪ 'Cause he was wrong About all the things I'll list-- ♪  -[knocking at door] -[Nanny gasps]
[agent] DOS. Open the door.
-[muffled singing] -We gotta go.
-Can I help ya? -We're looking for missing children.
Oh, they've been found, mister.
Bye!
[gasps] As long as they think you guys are orphans, they will never give up.
[sighs] There's only one way out of this.
You're not going to like it, but what if we get our parents back?
-[Nanny] What? -Parents?
Nanny, hands on the wheel, please. Sorry. Sorry. But you guys have bad parents.
Yes, I know they're despicable, but they're the only ones we've got.
Look, the Orphan Service lady said that if our biological parents return,
we can stay together.
We have to get them back.
Well, we do know where they're heading.
Sveetzerlünd.
He who goes up... Does not come down.
-Careful. [yelps] -Huzzah!
Aren't these pointy hats splendid, snugglebug?
Those pitons add such brawn to your manly feet.
[both] To adventure!
-[Mother trilling] -[Father laughing] [The Cat] How could such clever kids come from these two?
I mean, this is Darwinism at work, isn't it?
Ugh. Do we really have to save them?
-[yawns] Willoughbys? -[Ruth coos]
I love your factory. I need your factory. Give me your factory.
Tonight.
Hiya, Mel.
We have to build something to get us to Sveetzerlünd.
Okay.
-Plan A. -Plan B.
Do it.
[Jane] That's what I call a dirigible.
-Nice work, Barnabys. -Good dirigible.
-Nice work, Barnabys. -Good dirigible. Delicious dirigible.
To Sveetzerlünd.
[yelps and giggles] Easy, Ruthie.
All right, you kids go pee. I'll be right back with the oats.
-[Melanoff] Yes. Oats. -[Nanny] Whoo!
Look at this. Ruthie wants to help. [laughs]
It's almost like...
They're a family.
[automated voice] Starting route to Sveetzerlünd.
Ah, Sveetzerlünd. You're gonna love it there, Ruthie.
The land of chocolate, cheese and knives. -[Nanny yelps] -Whoa!
What? Tim!
Do you think Nanny will be mad we snuck out and ran off with the dirigible
Do you think Nanny will be mad we snuck out and ran off with the dirigible and stole her phone?
-[Barnabys] And her purse. -She is definitely mad.
-[Barnabys] And her purse. -She is definitely mad. But we orphaned ourselves. We will unorphan ourselves.
But we orphaned ourselves. We will unorphan ourselves.
[Barnaby] I'm alive! I'm finally alive!
Check it out.
[The Cat] As these Willoughbys flew east towards the sunrise,
I'm just along for the ride, in this cone.
I told you this story would be exciting. Will they reach their parents in time? Dunno. I'm in a cone!
Will they reach their parents in time? Dunno. I'm in a cone!
A-ha. Unclimbable Alp, they say.
Doesn't compare to the mounds of love we've climbed, sweet Mother.
-Oh, Father, take me to the tippy top. -[honking horn]
What are you doing, you idiots? [yelling indistinctly]
Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother. [echoing] Mother, dear!
-Oh, look, snow. -Ooh.
Fill her up, buddy.
-Sugar in the drain pipe. -Sugar in the gas tank.
Good morning, we're going to stop our parents from killing themselves.
Good morning, we're going to stop our parents from killing themselves. Bye!
Yeah! Nice!
Keep up, honey, keep up!
-So much better than walking. -[barks]
[snoring] Barnaby, Barnaby, Barnaby...
[exclaims] I don't believe I can... [teeth chattering] feel my nose.
[teeth chattering] No. [shivering] We're out of yarn.
I can't knit!
Oh, Mother, sweets. Father, we've made a horrible mistake.
[gasps] We must go back home.
[gasps loudly] Oh, Mother, you are my home.
[automated voice] You have arrived at your destination.
There it is.
They could be anywhere up-- There. Look.
[Tim] I suspect our parents had something to do with that.
They do make a mess of things.
-Something outside. -Definitely something outside.
Looky, looky.
Willoughby red. Human fibers. Silky smooth. Father's tardigrades.
I can't knit.
Mother's yarn!
-Yes! -We got 'em now.
[Barnaby] Follow that yarn!
Hang on, Willoughbys!
I can't see a thing.
No visibility.
Ice to see you.
[laughs] Great pun, Jane.
Oh, no! We're losing power!
Barnabys, what's going on?
-Altitude. Keep driving. -We need more rainbow.
Faster, guys!
[both] Rainbow. Rainbow. Rainbow. Rainbow.
A-ha! Punch it.
[Barnabys] Rainbow. Rainbow. Rainbow!
Unclimbable, but not unflyable.
Look! The yarn leads right to...
Oh, no!
'Tis like a yard of graves.
Hurry! [grunting]
[panting] They have to be here!
-Split up! -[Barnabys] Splitting!
[grunting] Tree. Tree.
[grunting] Tree. Tree. -Tree here, too. -Another tree.
-Tree here, too. -Another tree. No sign of them.
[echoing] This is impossible!
We're all going to freeze out here if we don't find them.
[gasps] I hear something.
Me, too. Definitely hear something. Is it a some or a thing?
It is some and a thing. Go!
-[Barnaby] Not a tree! -It's parents!
[gasps] Their kiss, it's still warm.
Heaters. Fire. [howls]
Come on. Come on.
-[kids cheering] -[laughing] We have parents.
-A mommy. -And a daddy.
[shivering] Children? Ah, Fatherkins, are we back home?
[shivering] No, dearest. On an alp.
We have come to your rescue.
Rescue? Us?
But how?
-We knew where you were going. -We sent you away.
[both] The Reprehensible Travel Agency.
The brochure? Mother's balls! This was... you?
Mother's balls! This was... you?
We wanted, um, to orphan ourselves.
-But we were wrong. -Very wrong.
Oh, my.
Look, we are not a perfect family.
We're not even a good family.
But you need us to get down this alp, and once we're down there, we need you so that we can all stay together.
and once we're down there, we need you so that we can all stay together.
You don't have to love us, but will thou be our parents again?
[kids] Please.
Oh, Father, maybe we were wrong. We can do better.
Shall we? For love.
For love.
-Get out of my way! -Ugh.
[Father] Would you look at that machine?
[Mother] Oh, I do love to fly.
Run, Mother. Run as fast as you can.
[The Cat] I did not see that one coming. -[Mother] I didn't bring my running dress. -[Father] Lift those limbs.
-[Mother] I didn't bring my running dress. -[Father] Lift those limbs. [Mother] Here I come, Father! To adventure!
[Mother] Here I come, Father! To adventure!
Mother, where did you learn to drive?
I thought you were driving, darling.
[The Cat] Unfortunately, the Willoughby parents remained thoroughly...
-What do these pedals do? -Oh.
[The Cat] ...incredibly and utterly selfish.
[The Cat] ...incredibly and utterly selfish. Oh, dear.
Any chance they survived that?
I don't think so.
[The Cat] Oh, no. All the determination, imagination.
Doesn't matter how good you are, does it? The world can be a pretty cold place.
We have to stay warm.
Oh, Tim.
[gasps] It's frozen. Definitely frozen.
-[Barnaby A] Hot! -[Barnaby B] Get the hot.
[Jane] No! Barnabys! No! Stay together!
-[gasps] -Oh, the hot is gone.
Tim, what do we do now?
The yarn! We followed it up. We can follow it back down.
We followed it up. We can follow it back down. -Tim! Come back! Please! We have to... -[grunting]
-Tim! Come back! Please! We have to... -[grunting]
No! [grunts]
It's hopeless.
[Jane] Come back.
-[Jane shivering] -Cold.
-[both shivering] -Sweater.
No. [breathing heavily]

[sighs] Tragic.
But remember, this is an old-fashioned story,
and as such, it can't end like this, can it?
-[Tim] Ruth? -[Barnabys gasp]
[Barnaby A] It's a Swiss gyrocopter. [Barnaby B] Whoo! There's a can opener!
That's a corkscrew.
[Melanoff] Lickety twist!
-Oh, Skinny Bones. -Nanny? [yelps]
After all we've been through, you abandon us? Oh!
[muffled] But how did you find us? We followed the rainbow into the storm.
Then Ruth heard your jolly jingle. -[chuckles] -[Ruth coos]
You heard my song? Wow.
It was beautiful, Jane.
I'm sure your folks loved it. Speaking of folks, where are they?
I want to tell them how great their kids are.
They stole our dandy dirigible.
We have really bad parents.
You mean had.
We're orphans. For real.
-What? -Oh.
[Barnaby] No parents.
-No home. -No place to go.
We've lost it all.
But we have each other.
Look, we sailed a candy dirigible over an ocean,
climbed the unclimbable.
-We didn't actually climb. -I know, but it's a nice speech.
So as long as we stick together, we'll be okay.
With or without parents.
[gasps] What if-- We became a family?
[both] Hi, Mommy.
I'm all in! [laughing]
-Diddly-dee! Same with me! -[all cheering]
-Diddly-dee! Same with me! -[all cheering] Commander, get us out of here. It's too cold to be mushy.
Commander, get us out of here. It's too cold to be mushy.
Grandy dandy!
Why aren't we using the helicopter?
We don't need no helicopters. We're family.
[The Cat] Okay, it's a bit weird, all right? But we got there in the end.
Determination, imagination, hope.
Told you I know a good story when I see one.
The best stories are the hard ones, y'know?
[Tim] Hmm! It's not bushy.
Still, it is a mustache.
I think we know what that means, right, Tim?
[scoffs] We're not doing the great thing anymore, since that happened.
Mustache.
Well, if you ate your oats, Tim... [in deep voice] you'd have hair everywhere.
Maybe hairless Tim wants something new.
I call it Melanoff meatloaf!
-Ruth. -[Nanny] Oh, no, no.
[laughs] Look, Tim. Ruth has a meat mustache.
[Ruth] Willoughby.
Look at them, a perfectly imperfect family.
And while they didn't get everything they wanted...
[Tim] Here we go! [The Cat] ...they got what they needed.
I guess we all need love. Even me.
[Jane] I love my mustache!
[The Cat] See? They all lived happily ever after.
Which is more than I can say for... you know.
Oh, mushy buns, I do love seeing the world with you.
Even the wet bits.
Nothing will stop us from adventuring, Mother. [giggles]
the watch tells me I have a heart problem.
Wouldn't a mirror tell you the same thing?
Yeah, but this has weather, too.
Okay.
We got an hour until we're meeting the ladies for dinner.
-Yeah. -You wanna catch a beer?
I can't. I gotta run a few errands.
What? You don't want a beer? What's wrong?
[sighs] I... got the results back from the detective exam.
You failed again? This is why I never took that test.
All the anxiety and disappointment.
At some point, you have to realize you have hit your ceiling
and just give up.
You know, you should go around and speak at schools.
-That was very inspiring. -I should. Kids need to hear this shit.
I don't get it, man.
I know all the answers, I just freeze under pressure.
You know, I can't take the exam for, like, three more months,
so I gotta continue lying to Audrey.
So when we're at dinner tonight, please,
-tell your wi-- -Ah! No.
Come on, man. You know I'll lie for you anytime.
I will cover up dead bodies for you.
But if I ask Holly to lie to your wife, there's no way we're messing around.
It's Freaky Friday!
You don't have to lie, just tell her to ignore when I'm lying.
That's it.
-Okay, fine. -Thank you.
-You owe me. -[phone buzzing]
See you tonight.
I gotta get Claritin. Claritin.
[gasps] Oh, my God! Look!
[woman 1] He took her in a helicopter?
My husband won't even pay for Uber Black.
[chuckles] Yeah. I don't even-- I can't even remember the last time that Nick did anything even remotely romantic.
that Nick did anything even remotely romantic.
I mean, he used to leave me, like, cute little mixtapes,
little love notes in the bathroom.
Love notes are dead.
When my husband wants to have sex, he just texts me the eggplant and doughnut emoji.
Eggplant and doughnut--
Oh. He's the eggplant.
More like a fingerling potato.
[woman 2] It doesn't take that much.
There are guys at the intersection selling flowers.
You just roll down the window, grab a bunch, bring 'em home.
-I mean, they couldn't make it any easier. -[woman 2] No kidding.
I mean, tomorrow is our 15th wedding anniversary.
I'm still waiting on that trip to Europe he promised me on our wedding day.
-[woman 1] That's been 15 years? -Yeah.
-I could have walked to Europe by now. -[laughs]
You know, you just have to tell him.
I just don't want to have to tell him. I just want him to know.
-No, they never just know. -I know.
-That doesn't happen. -You have to tell men everything.
If you want the dishes to not go in the sink, you have to tell them.
If you want him to shower before he comes to bed,
-you have to ask him. -Ugh.
That's why they have those signs in bathrooms at restaurants
to tell employees to wash their hands.
Those aren't for women, guys. Those are for men.
Or maybe you could just text him, airplane, wine glass,
Italian flag, eggplant, doughnut, doughnut, doughnut.
Let's go with the 50.
Claritin...
[cashier] Hi, welcome.
Thank you.
-[woman] Thanks a lot. -[register beeping]
Are you gonna tell 'em about the stuff in your backpack?
Mind your own business, man. I'm paying for this.
I like your sneakers. They must be expensive.
Is that why can't afford the Monster Energy Drink
or the Flamin' Hot Cheetos?
-Hang on. Hang on. -Hey, let go of me, man.
I can't believe I was right.
Keep your mouth shut. I'll mess you up, old man.
Old man. Oh, my God.
First of all,
I should throw you in jail just for calling me "old man,"
but you bring that stuff back,
I'll let you go 'cause I'm late for dinner and I'm hungry as shit.
Go ahead.
-[man 1] Tylenol PM? Am I right? -[man 2] No.
-[man 1] Tylenol PM? Am I right? -[man 2] No. [woman 1] It's not good for that. It depends on what time of year you go.
[woman 1] It's not good for that. It depends on what time of year you go.
[woman 2] That makes sense. Can I get another? We're gonna have another one?
I'm just saying, we're paying today. Maybe you can take it easy a little bit.
Hey, hey. Nick. Nick. What-- What's wrong with you?
Sorry. Should I not order another drink, Detective?
No. Holly, order another drink. [chuckles] Order as much as you want. I was joking around.
[chuckles] Order as much as you want. I was joking around.
-That's not funny. -The reason-- I'm just in a great mood because I had a great day today.
-Did we have a great day or what? -It was a fabulous day. Incredible day.
Really? Did you get another hot case?
Of what?
-"What." -[laughing] That was good. No, listen.
Going great, kid. I promise you.
It's like, uh, they're trusting me more and more,
and I, um, I wish I could tell you what it was,
but it's-- it's confidential.
-Wait a second. -What?
Oh, my God.
-What is this? -[Nick] What is that?
My baby Jimmy got it for me for my birthday.
-Jimmy! -What?
-[Holly] Celebration diamonds. -Oh, my gosh.
-[Holly] Celebration diamonds. -Oh, my gosh. -It's gorgeous! -Thank you, Audrey.
-It's gorgeous! -Thank you, Audrey. -Very expensive. -[Audrey] Wow, Jimmy.
-Very expensive. -[Audrey] Wow, Jimmy.
I got you something special. I promise, you're gonna be very happy.
-[Holly] Really? -I can't wait.
See, I would've pegged you, Nick, as an Amazon gift card kinda guy,
but... I'm no detective.
Hey! You know what, guys?
Let's toast to my friends, Nick and Audrey. Fifteen wonderful years.
Absolutely.
-[Jimmy] Fifteen. -Here's to true love, guys.
Fifteen.
-True love. -Yeah.
Dinner was insane, but that's expected.
But I'll tell you what, I want to record Holly chewing her ice cubes,
use it as my alarm in the morning. That's--
Guarantee me of wanting to wake up and leave.
What's the matter? You didn't like that joke?
I'm flossing.
[muffled] I can see that.
You're doing it extra hard tonight.
And I'm not sleeping with the fan on tonight. I hate that sound.
No fan necessary. We'll crank the AC, babe.
Uh-oh. What, what, what? You're gonna yell at me? I can see this. Hang on.
Why don't you do some more angry flossing?
How come we haven't gone to Europe, Nick?
You have to explain this to me.
We never go anywhere.
[stammers] We travel. I took you to the Poconos that time.
What? The Poco-- That was-- That was for a funeral, Nick.
How about, uh, when we went to Virginia when my uncle was in a hospice and we got to see him die?
when my uncle was in a hospice and we got to see him die?
-We did that. -Ugh, Nick. Come on.
I'm talking about the postcard.
-You don't remember that? -I remember it. Of course I remember it.
It's been 15 years, Nick. I don't know what we're waitin' for.
[sighs] Now you've gone and done it, Audrey.
What? What'd I do?
I told you I had something big for you at dinner,
and you couldn't wait till tomorrow morning?
No.
We're finally going to Europe. Happy anniversary.
Oh, my God. I have chills.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I'm so--
Oh, my God! I'm so-- -I ruined your surprise! -Shh. You didn't ruin anything.
-I ruined your surprise! -Shh. You didn't ruin anything.
You're the greatest. You deserve it. I love you.
-I love you! -It's still a surprise. I swear.
-We can afford it, right? This is all-- -We can afford it, of course.
-Okay. -I'm getting my raise this year.
-Right. -We're all set. Come on.
-[Audrey] Hello. Hi. -Hello.
So, uh, we are on our honeymoon,
and I was wondering if we could possibly get an upgrade
because I have miles. Maybe--
I don't even know if it's from this airline, but do they expire, or--
Sir, you would have needed to request that in advance.
-[Audrey] Yeah. -Right this way, please.
-Thank you. I'm so sorry. -We did try advance. I tried calling.
-Thank you. I'm so sorry. -We did try advance. I tried calling. -And, um, nobody-- -Who'd you call?
-Crazy busy signals. -Really?
-It's the busy signals! -Who did you try to call?
I don't want to give it away. It was the butler.
-The butler did it. -[sighs]
It's never the butler who did it.
I don't even think there are butlers.
That's just a word created for those goofy books you're addicted to.
Would you just please, please shh?
Leave my books alone, okay? Just let me read.
I just like-- Makes me happy.
Are you okay? You're cranky. Are you bored?
-I'm gonna go to sleep. -Take a nap.
-Are you okay with that? -Wait, don't--
-Are you okay with that? -Wait, don't-- But just, please, don't-- don't lay all the way back.
-Don't take it back? -No.
Why? You don't want my double chin to show?
It's not your chins, okay. It's just rude.
Yes.
-Okay. 'Cause you splay out. -All right.
And then your seat is in, like, the lap of the guy behind you.
-So just be considerate of everybody. -I'll stay up. Thank you.
Timber.
[whispering] Oh, excuse me.
-Hi. -Hello. Hi.
Could I please have some earplugs?
Yes. For nine dollars.
Nine dollars? For earplugs?
Yes.
That's okay. I'll just-- I'll just use my peanuts.
I'll just--
Wow.
A fellow insomniac, I see.
Jesus. Yes. I--
Yep. I know, right? I just cannot sleep on these things.
So what brings you across the pond?
Actually, it's my-- it's my honeymoon.
Oh. Congratulations.
-Thank you. -Where's your husband?
Dead.
Asleep. He's dead-- dead asleep.
We've actually been married for 15 years, but we just have been very, very, very, very busy.
Then a toast to the whirlwind that is your life.
Yes.
-Sorry, ma'am. -Oh, yes!
The bar is for first class passengers only.
Of course. Of course it is. I'm so sorry, yes.
I will head back to the lower class cabin
and sit where I should and, uh... shovel some coal.
She's my guest.
Unfortunately, sir, she'd need her own first class ticket.
Charles Cavendish.
I'm so sorry, sir.
Whoa!
Charles Cavendish?
Is that your real name?
[chuckles] I'm afraid so.
I mean, that sounds like it just fell right out of a... mystery novel.
And which character would I be?
Name like that, you'd have to be the bad guy.
Well... here's to the bad guys.
-Okay, so your fiancée... -Hm.
...leaves you...
[chuckles] ...for your elderly uncle--
Will you two kindly shut up?
Oh, be quiet.
Or we shall tell everyone about the ferret you've smuggled in here.
-[giggling] -The whole thing is tawdry, I know.
-[under breath] Tawdry. -He desired my betrothed,
and Uncle Malcolm always gets what he wants.
Malcolm. Uncle Malcolm.
-Quince. -Uncle--
Malcolm Quince is your uncle? That billionaire?
-That's the one. -Oh, my gosh.
He looks just like this...
if this wrinkled olive had $70 billion.
Seventy billion dollars.
I'm traveling to Monaco with the newlyweds on his yacht
for the Grand Prix this weekend.
Why? Why would you do that?
Why would you go on their yacht after what they just did?
Because I'm English, Mrs. Spitz.
-I'm a glutton for social masochism. -Oh.
And I plan on getting blind drunk and ruining the festivities.
Okay. I support that.
-I say, Audrey... -Hm.
Do you and your husband have plans this weekend?
Holy shit! This plane has a bar?
Sir, this is the first class lounge.
I'm gonna have to ask you to return to your seat.
There's bars on planes now?
Planes have bars now. In first class.
This is-- Man, I wish my mother was still alive to see this.
She was an alcoholic, but a nice one.
Sir, if you don't return to your seat, I'm gonna have to call--
The cops.
So that's my wife
talking to that handsome guy over there with the one chin.
So I'm gonna go break that shit up, possibly grab myself a beer,
maybe you a Xanax.
...the wine on board is worth a letter.
[Charles] People don't write letters anymore, do they?
-[Charles] Such a pity. -It's just, it's all so tactical.
Yeah, that's true.
Hey! Nick.
-[Nick] How are you? -Hi, honey. You're awake.
-Was your nappie good? -Been awake.
-I was looking for you. -I know, I'm--
-Well, I met this lovely gentleman. -Oh, yeah?
I'd like you to meet Charles Cavendish.
-He's a lord. Right? -How do you do?
-[Audrey] A lord? -Well, actually a viscount.
-Oh. -Although viscounts are addressed as Lord,
which probably accounts for the lovely Audrey's confusion.
There you go. She gets confused with me too.
Sometimes I'm the king. Sometimes I'm Daddy.
So... can I get a Labatts, brother?
That'll be 17 euro.
No, no, no. Please.
The beer is on me.
I'm not just taking a beer from somebody I don't know.
Oh, my gosh.
And I do hope you take advantage of my other offer.
Hey. I'm not just gonna stand here
while you offer to pay me to have sex with my wife.
But out of curiosity, how much are we talking?
-Great. -I wouldn't do it.
-Hey, listen to me. -What?
He is inviting us to spend the weekend with him on a yacht with his family.
Well, we have plans.
On a bus.
A bus that is bound for the idyllic village of San Grigio,
where we can watch a demonstration on how they age ham.
-Let me explain something. -Tell me what I'm missing.
-Let me explain something. -Tell me what I'm missing. -Are you kidding me? -Go.
We would be sailing around European harbors.
-Yeah. -Okay? We'd be eating fresh fish.
-Right. -And we'd be drinking wine.
-Hmm. -We'd be together.
That's nice.
-They have a chef. -They have a chef.
His name is Maurice. Maurice?
-Maurice, yes. -Maurice.
"Some people call me Maurice."
Remember that one?
-Can I talk to you for a second? -Sure.
[Nick] I gotcha.
So listen-- What are you doing?
Why would two adults come into a bathroom on an airplane?
Honey, come on. To have a private conversation.
Ah, that's funny.
Listen. I'm just trying to understand
why you are turning down the opportunity of a lifetime.
Because I don't trust that guy.
-Why? -'Cause instincts.
Your instincts?
The same ones that told you you were about to get laid in here?
I'm not getting laid?
Come on! When is the next time you and I are gonna be able to get on a yacht?
I'm just saying, all those times we're eating ham sandwiches
and you're always asking, "How do they age the ham?"
-Never had that-- -We'll never ask that question again
-because we'll be in San Grigio. -That never happened.
They'll give us the reason on how they do it so perfectly.
Okay. You wanna know the truth? -You're breaking my heart. -Why?
I feel like a schmuck
because I've been working my ass off and saving money, and now you know why.
It was to take us on this trip. And I know I'm not a duke.
I understand. He's a viscount, but--
-I don't even know what that is. -I know. It's okay.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
-I got lost. I got swept up in it. -I know. But it's okay. We're gonna do the bus. It's gonna be great.
But it's okay. We're gonna do the bus. It's gonna be great.
We'll do the bus. You're gonna love the bus!
[woman] Hey! Hey, Gonzales. Where is our welcome glass of champagne?
-We were promised... -[child] Summer hit me!
[woman] ...a glass of champagne when we arrived...
[man] Zip it! Both of you! Will you stop that?
I know you hear me!
[man] Shut up!
Let's do the-- We'll do the yacht, okay?
-Thank you. -All right.
Cavendish! We've changed our minds. We're gonna come.
We've changed our minds. We're gonna come.
Splendid.
-[Audrey] Hello. -Bienvenidos.
Thank you.
-Thank you. -De nada.
-This is amazing. -Señor.
I thought it was gonna be bigger.
-[Audrey] What? -I did.
-[Audrey] Bigger than this? -I really did.
I bet that's Cavendish's ex-fiancée who left him for his uncle.
Oh, okay. I'm starving. Where's that Maurice dude?
Uh, I don't think we're supposed to talk to him directly.
-Let's wait for dinner. -Which is when?
I don't-- Honey, it's later. I don't know. It's Europe, okay?
The bus observes a standard American dinnertime, so...
[Audrey] Oh, baby, this is like a painting.
-[Nick] No, it's nice-- -[Audrey] It just doesn't look real.
-[Nick] It's-- -[Audrey] Oh, my God!
Wow. Look. She's so pretty.
-[Nick] Very pretty. -She's that kind of pretty
that you don't really know what country she's from.
I mean, I can't tell. Can you tell?
Japan.
Ah, yes, yes. You see? See? She can hear you.
She's not a-- not on television right now.
-You're watching a real person. -Shh.
Crashing the party with civilians.
Are you drunk?
It's only noon, Suzi, darling.
Of course I'm drunk.
So, where is your beloved, Sir Liver Spots?
Malcolm is not here yet. You know how he likes to make an entrance.
You'd know more about Malcolm's entrances than anyone at this point.
-Great to meet you. You're terrific. -Nice to meet you. Pleasure.
[clears throat] I'm sorry you had to see that.
-Actually, I started to like you. -She deserved that.
-Very good. You came on strong. -She is not nice. You're hurt.
-Very good. You came on strong. -She is not nice. You're hurt. Charles.
So glad you could make it.
And you brought guests.
Allow me to introduce my cousin, Tobey.
Malcolm's only son and the man Suzi would have left me for,
had he not been a screaming queen.
-[Nick] Okay. -Thank you for having us aboard, sir.
Yeah. Hey, really nice.
It's my father's boat.
Oh, well, her father, uh, let me use his lawnmower one time,
-so I know how that goes. -Yeah.
How do you know Charles?
Oh. We go back to six hours ago? -Yes. -We met on an airplane.
[Audrey] He was very nice to include us.
We have a spare cabin for them, I assume.
Well, seeing as you have so much history, I'm sure we can find some room.
Thank you. Thanks for the warm welcome. Appreciate it. After you.
-Up here? This keeps going up? -Really nice of you. So we go this way?
-[Audrey] Wow. -There's another deck, hun. Another deck!
"Sex-crazed oldster Malcolm Quince
wed 23-year-old ski instructor Suzi Nakamura this week."
-Mm-hmm. -"Why would the Tokyo-born tart trade downhills for dentures?
Perhaps the $70 billion his son, Tobey, was set to inherit."
-Wow. -Oh, my God, baby.
We are literally right in the middle of a TMZ story.
You were right about this yacht. Their shaving cream smells like coconuts.
-It's incredible. -Sorry.
You're allergic to rich people now?
No. Stop it! I'm allergic to stuff. Would you please grab me the Claritin?
Yes. Here.
Baby, that's Allegra. You said you packed Claritin.
That's the same thing.
No, honey. Allegra doesn't work for me.
Okay. When we get to Monaco, I'll get you your Claritin.
It's not-- It's gonna be called something else over there, I'm telling you. Just remember, we-- The blue box.
I'm telling you. Just remember, we-- The blue box.
You know, "Allegra" in, uh, French means the same shit as Claritin.
-Smile. -Yes.
[Suzi] You need to stop drinking. You're a drunk.
[Audrey] Look at him.
Why is he torturing himself like that? I mean, she's already married to Malcolm.
I don't know what else he's expecting her to say to him.
-She's saying he's a cad... -[Audrey gasps]
...and he's saying she's a tramp,
and they're both right.
How do I know you? You're-- You're an actress, right?
All women are actresses, dear.
I'm just clever enough to get paid for it.
Grace Ballard.
Oh! [laughs loudly] My God!
That's-- This is incr-- I'm a massive fan of yours!
-Like, number one! -Oh.
-This isn't-- -I know. It's incredible.
I am Nick Spitz. This is my wife, Allison.
-I can't believe-- -Aud-- Audrey. I'm Audrey.
-I said Audrey! -No, you didn't.
Allison is the character she played in the-- [stammers] Remember the one? We watched it together.
[stammers] Remember the one? We watched it together.
Where it's a beautiful lady, it turns out she's a robot?
-And there's the bra-- -She's the robot!
-There's guns coming out of your bra. -Yes!
-There's guns coming out of your bra. -Yes! Sex Machina. My breakout role.
Sex Machina. My breakout role. So good. Look at this, right in front of us!
So good. Look at this, right in front of us!
I feel like I got kicked in the belly right now!
-Okay. Hey, hey, hey. -I lost my wind!
Let's go put on some sunscreen 'cause it's--
You already put the sunscreen on me earlier.
No, we're gonna-- we're gonna reapply the sunscreen.
-We're putting more on? -We're gonna reapply.
All right. We'll put more on.
-So nice to meet you. -I can't believe-- This is great!
-He's so excited. -We're on the same ship!
Look at that. It says that her last name isn't even really Ballard.
Well, so what?
How do you just come out looking that beautiful?
-Oh, she's had it all done. -What?
Lips, nose, chin.
No!
People really get their chins done? -Mm-hmm. -Huh!
That was so directed at me, it was disgusting.
[Nick] You want me to get my chin done. And I'm not--
[Audrey] I love you for who you are. Although it's an option.
-[both laugh] -Would you guys excuse me for a moment? -I should say hello to the Maharajah. -Absolutely.
-I should say hello to the Maharajah. -Absolutely. -Everyone's saying it. -Do you believe we're on a boat
-Everyone's saying it. -Do you believe we're on a boat where the guy said, "I'm gonna go have a conversation with the Maharajah?"
where the guy said, "I'm gonna go have a conversation with the Maharajah?"
-[laughing] That was big. -Is this real?
Excuse me, ma'am?
Is there a Maurice here? 'Cause I'm hungry as hell.
Yes, sir. He's preparing.
He's preparing. Okay. Is he ever gonna finish?
[Nick] Please tell Maurice to step on the gas.
-Oh, honey, honey, honey. -Mm-hmm?
Okay, um, don't look right now, but there's a really scary man
Okay, um, don't look right now, but there's a really scary man -with an eye patch... -Mm-hmm?
...who's just staring right at us.
I said don't look and you can't not do it.
You say eye patch and scary, I'm gonna look.
I'm sorry. It's physically impossible not to.
[Audrey] All right. Okay. He's walking at us.
-Honey, honey. -Play it cool.
-Hey, fellas. What's up? How are ya? -[Audrey] Hey. Hi.
-[man] Who let you two on board? -Excuse me?
What is happening right now?
They're my guests, Colonel.
-This weekend is for family only. -[Charles] Really?
The last time I checked, you're not family.
Neither is Soviet Chewbacca over there.
Nick, Audrey.
-Yeah, you're not family for sure. -Okay.
Jesus. So I see one of them was packing heat.
-Was I supposed to bring a gun? -Oh, I doubt it's even loaded.
That's Colonel Charles Ulenga of the Namibian Defense Force.
Malcolm's best friend.
He saved his life from a bombing attempt in '94.
That's where he lost his eye and his-- And his dick? Did he lose his dick?
-Honey, why? -I thought that maybe it was his dick.
And that's Sergei Radjenko, former Spetsnaz, and his bodyguard.
Crazy eye patch guy needs a bodyguard?
[Audrey] Whoa! The hand! There's a hand. It's not on his body anymore.
[Nick] Oh, look at this. Now he's smoking his dick!
-He's smoking his dick! -No. Oh, God. Would you stop it?
I'm just having fun. It's a boat.
[Audrey] Can I ask you a question?
What exactly... is a maharajah?
Why don't you ask him yourself?
No. [Charles] Vik, I have some guests I'd like you to meet.
[Charles] Vik, I have some guests I'd like you to meet.
Nick and Audrey Spitz,
I present the exalted Maharajah Vikram Shivan Govindan of Mumbai.
-Oh, my gosh. It's so-- -Hey.
So nice to--
-[Nick] Nice-- -[Audrey] We're--
[in English accent] Yo-ho-ho! That was very hilarious. Ah!
With all the bowin' and shit.
You know, when a brown person bows, white people bow back, innit?
-Up high. How about-- -I'm sorry.
He's giving you-- Respect!
-That was very good. Very funny. -That was a joke.
Audrey has a question she'd like to ask you.
Let me hear it. [laughs]
Oh. We were actually wondering, what exactly is a maharajah?
How do you-- Do you have to go to a school for that?
Yeah, I was born into the game.
-Oh, you're born into it. -Okay, born into it.
What do you do, Nick?
-I am-- -Nick's a detective.
Tight! You ever wet up anyone?
-What's that? -Yeah, you know, like drill,
-What's that? -Yeah, you know, like drill, bust a cap, waste. You're like... [imitates gunfire]
-He's funny. No, never shot anybody. -No! God!
Which is a good thing.
Nick is-- Well, it's just that you're a terrible shot.
He's a terrible shot.
He barely got out of the academy
because he couldn't even meet, like, his minimum marksmanship skills.
Audrey is lactose intolerant.
-She also burps in her sleep. -What?
I just thought 'cause we are discussing each other's flaws right now,
you wanted to put it on the table.
I'm sorry I-- Listen, I didn't think that was a sensitive subject--
It's not a sensitive subject, I just don't like you telling
It's not a sensitive subject, I just don't like you telling -everybody we meet. -I'm sorry I brought it up. Never mind.
-everybody we meet. -I'm sorry I brought it up. Never mind.
-[Nick] Whoa. -Oh, my gosh. Look at this.
-[Nick] Whoa. -Oh, my gosh. Look at this. -Look at this crazy. -Wow. Babe.
Well, this room is as nice as the way you look.
-You look stunning. -Thank you, honey. That's so sweet.
What?
Everybody's in tuxedos. -I wish you'd let me pack. -I shoulda wore socks. You're right.
-I wish you'd let me pack. -I shoulda wore socks. You're right.
-Yo! Juan Carlos! -Hey!
-Oh, good luck, man. -Hey.
Hi. Hi, there. What are we wishing you good luck for?
Well, he is racing in the Monaco Grand Prix tomorrow.
Wow. That's big.
Juan Carlos Rivera, let me introduce you to--
Steve and Lady Steve.
-[Audrey] What? -[Nick] No.
-[Audrey] No, no. -I mean, if you want.
-Just met us once. -Yeah, all right. I'm gonna... -I'm Audrey. -...go again.
I'm Nick, and then we're the Spitzes.
Juan Carlos, huh?
[Nick] Hey, Juan Carlos.
So you're a race car driver.
Good, yes. [chuckles]
Wow. How do you get into something like that?
Uh, number one, yes.
You don't speak English, do you?
Uh, very fast. Very fast.
-Huh? Welcome. -Okay.
What's that?
That is the Quince dagger.
[Charles] Chinese steel, jewels from across the Orient.
A gift to the family from Marco Polo,
or so the legend says.
God.
Nick's grandmother gave us a toaster from Sears.
[chuckles] So the legend says.
Oh, look. -[thud] -Here comes Daddy.
What's that?
Captain Wong,
I'd like to address my guests privately.
Certainly.
My friends,
welcome to the Mediterranean Queen.
I can't tell you how much it warms my heart
that you have made this trip here to celebrate my nuptials.
You will find, as you get older,
that you begin to take stock of life.
Not just where you've succeeded,
but where you've failed.
Who... you've failed.
Suzi, my darling bride,
who has so much of her life ahead of her.
Grace, who shines so brightly on the silver screen.
Juan Carlos, my godson,
who strives to lead my race team to victory.
You--
Who are you?
-Oh. Hey. We're the Spitzes. -We're the--
The who?
Uh, I'm Audrey, and Nick Spitz.
-Great. -We love the boat.
-A boat? I mean, this is a ship. -It's beyond.
-Never seen anything like this. -Eric Lamonsoff has a boat.
We go fishing. He's got a Boston Whaler.
This is gigantic.
They're my guests, Uncle.
You brought guests?
Well, you did take my plus-one.
I'm so sorry. Would you like us to leave?
We could-- I don't know how we're getting out of here, though.
We're-- We're out to sea. Is there an Uber for boats?
-Out-- Out of the room, Nick. -Out of the room?
We can go out of the room, absolutely-- No.
That won't be necessary.
-Okay. So we'll stick around. -So we stay. Okay.
My nephew, Charles, who always finds a way to keep me on my toes.
My friend, the Colonel, who's kept me safe these many years.
Vikram, whose family fortunes have always been intertwined with my own.
And my Tobias.
All I ever wanted was a son, and here you are.
My boy.
I've spoken to all of you about your position in my will.
I have thought long and hard about what each of you is truly worth,
and I've come to this conclusion.
You are all leeches.
Repugnant. Blood fat.
Suckling on the tit of my good work for so many years.
You repulse me.
[under breath] Can't get this on a bus, baby.
-This is incredible. -I know it.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
[Malcolm] Which is why I have drafted a new will.
It states that my entire fortune goes to Suzi.
[Malcolm] From this moment forth,
you are all cut off.
Abandoned. And perhaps, after I've done you this kindness,
you will finally be able to make something of yourselves... on your own.
Apparently, she's had enough of my caviar.
-That was funny. -Shh.
[Malcolm] Darling.
[Charles] You could've signed this at home.
Instead, you called us here to humiliate us?
[Malcolm] Yes, and you came running.
Father, don't do this.
Or what?
[Malcolm] Yes.
That's what I thought.
[Vik] Don't shoot me! Don't shoot me, please!
-Daddy! -[screams]
You shot him!
No! I saw someone stab him.
-Who? -I don't know.
What happened? I heard a scr--
Malcolm!
Oh, God!
Has anybody tried to revive him?
He's got a knife plunged in his heart. I don't think he's revivable.
Should we pull it out?
No. It's a foot-long knife. It's just like pulling--
Oh, God!
Wow! You should have left the knife in for the po-po, Colonel, man!
-I'll put it back. -Don't put it back.
Oh! Will you listen to my husband? He's a detective.
Yes, yes. What should we do, Mr. Officer?
Well, for starters, let's stop removing and reinserting the murder weapon
into the victim's chest.
In fact, let's stop touching the body altogether.
He was gonna take it all away.
For you.
[Vik] Yo...
Did he sign it?
No.
Yes!
We should make sure he doesn't have another copy on him.
Uh-- Mm-mm. Rifling through the pockets of the corpse counts as touching, yup.
Sorry to single you out like that, Ms. Ballard. You're wonderful.
Sorry to single you out like that, Ms. Ballard. You're wonderful. -You look extravagant tonight. -[Audrey] Okay. What's next?
-You look extravagant tonight. -[Audrey] Okay. What's next?
We have to preserve the crime scene.
Captain Wong, is there any way you can lock off this place?
Yes, of course.
So we should then start questioning the suspects.
Suspects?
We're not questioning anybody.
Wong, when you finish locking up here, you bring me the key.
Then you radio Interpol, tell 'em we'll meet 'em at the docks in Monaco.
In the meantime, I'm gonna check the shrimp out a little closer.
For the investigation?
No, Wong, because I'm hungry as shit.
The rest of you, I'd lock yourselves in your chambers or your yacht rooms
because one of us...
is a murderer.
-Audrey. -Yeah?
Get the cocktail sauce.
Yep.
Wait a second. What on earth is on these?
I don't know. This Maurice guy must breastfeed each shrimp individually.
I mean, they live so well.
-Oh, God, yeah. -God.
All right. Where were we? Okay, okay, okay.
You know what? There had to be two people in on the killing.
Because how could they know when the lights were gonna go out?
-That's smart, that's smart. -Right?
I'm tired as hell right now. I'm gonna go to sleep.
-Are you kidding me? -What?
You're not jet-lagged?
-Nick. -[groans]
-Honey, come on, seriously. -Huh?
Who do you think did it?
I don't think. I know.
Who?
It was the son.
-Tobey. -No.
No way. Not a chance. It's too obvious.
The most obvious suspect is never, never the killer.
The most obvious suspect is always the killer.
When a wife gets killed, 90% of the time it was the husband.
Why did you just use that as an example?
And I disagree.
I think people are more complicated than that.
Judging off of what? Those books that you read?
People are simple, okay? It was Tobey.
He had the most to gain, and he also had the most to lose.
Which is exactly why he's not the killer.
Did you ever fool around on a boat?
Do you know how much fun that could be?
I just lay here and the boat does all the work.
-That's so convenient for you. -You know I have a bad back.
So convenient for you.
What about the lights?
Yeah, leave 'em on. I don't care. Either way. Lady's choice.
Shh! No. Who turned out those lights? -[gunshot] -[yelps]
What?! Oh!
Don't look at me like that. I can feel it.
-I'm sorry. Excuse me. -Will you take the Allegra?
-I'm sorry. Excuse me. -Will you take the Allegra? It's the same stuff.
-I don't want to talk about it. -Oh, God.
[Audrey] Enter the brilliant yet tortured detective,
right on cue.
[man] Mesdames, messieurs.
My name is Inspector Laurent Delacroix.
I will now summon you one by one to the grand lounge for questioning.
Why is that smoke ring so good? How did he do that?
Oh, you broke it. You broke it.
Tell me about Malcolm Quince.
He was the most wonderful--
Swine.
He was the love of my life.
He was a complicated man.
Describe to me what happened.
Yo, Mr. French Policeman, man. It was mad. Lights went out.
[Colonel] I thought I saw something move, and I shot.
Yes. Finish line.
The old man got what was coming to him.
One-eight-seven, motherfu--
Did anyone touch the body?
No.
And did you notice anything else out of the ordinary?
-[all] The Americans. -Yes, number one. Yes.
[Audrey] Aren't you gonna, um...
Aren't you gonna separate us?
Pardon?
-For the interrogation. -[Nick] Okay.
Question us separately, see if our...
-What are you doing? -...answers match.
What? I'm just saying, our answers will match
What? I'm just saying, our answers will match -because we're innocent. -Yeah, that's right.
-because we're innocent. -Yeah, that's right.
There we go. God, you are really good at that. [chuckles]
We found this in Tobey Quince's suite.
A typewritten suicide note
in which he confesses to the murder of his father.
Typewritten? -Mm-mm. -That's not very common.
-Very suspicious. -[Nick] Yes.
Yeah, obviously someone is trying to frame Tobey for his father's murder.
-[Audrey] This is amazing. -[Nick] Look how excited she is.
So where's your head at with this whole thing?
I mean, who are your chief suspects?
You.
-Woo, yes. -Right, of course,
-'cause everybody is a suspect. -Especially her. [laughs]
This is a group of friends and family who have known each other for years.
You two show up, and ten hours later, two of them are dead.
Coincidence?
-Yes. -Absolutely.
-Coincidence. -Wait. Excuse me.
Are you saying that your theory
is that the two of us conned our way onto a stranger's boat at the last minute
to commit premeditated murder that benefits us in no way?
That's your theory?
Perhaps someone paid you to do it.
-No. -Paid us to do it? [laughs]
Oh, my gosh. I would love to see that. Show me that money.
[Audrey] Do you want to see our bank statements?
[Audrey] Do you want to see our bank statements? [stammers] We're broke.
Desperate for money. I see.
Now you gave him a motive.
-No, no, no. I know. Just don't... -We did this because--
-No, no, no. I know. Just don't... -We did this because-- -...take my words out of context. -We got nothing.
-That's all we got, is nothing. -No.
Listen, I am talking to you, detective to detective.
We didn't do this.
-You can see in my eyes. You can tell. -Mm-mm.
Perhaps I will have that word with you independently.
I di-- Hey!
I can get up.
Hey, okay.
[Nick] I'll be out in a minute.
[Nick] I love you.
I'm sorry. She's just excited because it's-- -She reads books, and this is fun for her. -[door closes]
You wish me to believe you're innocent.
Unfortunately, I do not believe liars.
But I'm telling you the truth.
And how long have you been lying to your wife?
Excuse me?
You did not think that we would investigate your background,
Sergeant Nicholas Spitz, NYPD?
Failed his detective's exam three times.
You are, how you do say, cop on the beat, not detective as you so claim.
So I... tell people I'm a detective.
There's-- That's not a crime.
Impersonating a detective is a crime.
I didn't think it was a crime here.
I thought maybe you guys had different rules.
That doesn't make us murderers.
A broke, failed man, lying to his wife? I think it does.
You don't have any evidence. You can't hold us.
No, but I can hold these.
I believe Mr. Cavendish has provided accommodations for you
at the Hotel de Savoie, so you won't be on the street.
But mark my words, Officer Spitz,
I will not rest until I prove that you committed these murders.
And I... will rest, because I'm tired as shit, at that hotel you just said.
will rest, because I'm tired as shit, at that hotel you just said.
It sounds like a good one.
But after I'm well-rested and I eat breakfast--
hopefully the guy cooks as good as Maurice--
I will not rest until I prove to you we have nothing to do with these murders.
[man] Juan Carlos!
[woman] Juan Carlos!
[Audrey] Charles said that everyone's gonna be at this race,
so whoever did this is gonna be there.
We have to figure out who it is.
I know we've gotta figure it out. This isn't one of your books, sweetheart.
I mean, it's like one of your books, but this is real.
Like, two people are dead, for real.
-I know. -There's a real killer on the real loose.
Hey, babe. Relax. What's-- What's wrong with you?
For real? Come on. Will you just focus...
-Fine. -...on this with me?
Um, yes. Uh...
[Nick] Okay. So there are three basic motives for every murder.
[Audrey] Yes. The first one is money.
Right.
Everyone was in Quince's will, except Suzi.
-Okay. -All right. The second one is love.
We know nobody loved that guy 'cause he was kind of a prick.
Suzi might have loved him.
-That's what you would think-- -Okay, what's the third one?
-Revenge. -Right.
That's the one we should be thinking about.
I'm telling you, if we figure out who hates this guy the most,
that's our killer. Okay. Okay.
So, this beard... It's incredible.
Do you oil that or condition?
You won't get anything out of him.
Oh, my gosh.
Most of his life, he's been serving men like me and Malcolm,
despite being an heir to millions.
He's rich, too?
He's supposed to be, but he's one of 16 children,
and he's half French.
Are you familiar with French inheritance law?
Broad strokes.
That Colonel guy, he's getting on my nerves.
-Yeah. -Shit. Walking around
-Yeah. -Shit. Walking around -saying you killed both those guys. -Huh?
-Yeah. -What?
And I'm like, come on. -My man wouldn't do-- -Yo. Look, yo. I didn't do nothing, son.
-My man wouldn't do-- -Yo. Look, yo. I didn't do nothing, son.
-It doesn't matter what the will says. -Uh-huh.
The fortune must be divided equally among the offspring.
Why do the French have such a law?
Well, they do it to keep all Frenchmen from doing what Malcolm was trying to do,
and leaving everything to their mistresses.
-My theory is... -Yeah?
...Juan Carlos done it, man.
What? Why would he do that?
Well, Juan Carlos's dad used to race for Malcolm.
Malcolm tried to get slick on some safety angle, and shit got overlooked.
-Yeah? -Okay.
Juan Carlos's dad lost both his legs, G.
Yeah, straight up. [imitates bones snapping]
-Oh. -Gone.
So it's payback time. A hundred percent of a doubt.
Wh-What?
-Juan Carlos is your man. -Oh, yeah.
You guarantee that?
Guarantee.
Respect.
Or maybe Sergei could have done it.
-Yeah. -Okay. So you're not guaranteeing it.
No, not a hundred percent. No.
-[sneezes] -Oh! Bless you.
Would you like some Allegra?
-I doubt that would be useful. -I know.
It doesn't work. I tried to tell that to Nick.
Do you need something?
Uh, no. Mm-mm.
The guy that throws me off the most-- Cavendish--
to me, he seems like he's compensating for something,
with the Great Gatsby look and the jawline
and the "hey, I'm so gorgeous." Am I right?
There's absolutely nothing wrong with Charles Cavendish.
-Isn't that the-- -Except...
he probably murdered his uncle.
Well, that's one thing wrong.
[commentator] ...comes to the checkered flag! It's Juan Carlos!
Winner of this year's Monte Carlo Grand Prix!
[Audrey] I find that Suzi Nakamura very suspicious.
She's the only one who didn't have a motive.
-It was Cavendish and you know it. -You just-- No, you just don't like him.
-It was Cavendish and you know it. -You just-- No, you just don't like him. I don't like him. I don't. I hate his guts, but that's not it.
I don't like him. I don't. I hate his guts, but that's not it.
-Did you just steal all of those? -He's the sole blood heir.
He stands to make the biggest claim for the fortune.
I want one of these.
-Malcolm stole his fiancée. -Okay.
That's all three motives. Money, love, revenge.
We went past it. I don't know where we are.
We're over here. Will you please try one of these?
No! Oh, my God. You know what?
I think you just think it's Cavendish 'cause you're jealous of him.
-[scoffs] Oh, God. -Yeah.
-I'm jealous of him. -You are.
What? Why? What am I jealous of?
What is there to be jealous-- He's rich. He's charming.
He smells great.
What do you mean? What's he smell like?
He smells like he just came out of the dryer.
What the-- What the--
[Audrey] No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
We should test that for fingerprints first.
Okay. Do you have the fingerprint testing kit?
-What? -'Cause I didn't pack mine.
Is it in your bag?
Stop it! Come on.
Hurry.
Oh, this is so crazy.
Oh, God. Seriously?
Oh, got it.
Will you please just go see a chiropractor?
It's gonna be fine.
"Come to suite 802."
-We have to go to 802. -We're not going to 802. Stop!
-Why? -It's a trap.
Why wouldn't whoever just knocked just come in and talk to us?
Maybe he's being watched by the killer.
What if we're being watched by the killer?
What if he was in here?
Maybe he stole my Peanut M&Ms.
I stole your Peanut M&Ms. You stole my Peanut M&Ms?
-I wanted to see if they tasted the same! -You got to stop eating.
You're gonna gain it all back.
I'm going to 802. Are you coming with me?
Okay, wait. Let me just...
-What? -...figure something out.
God damn.
-What are you doing? -It's a weapon.
That's a lamp.
Not when I crack someone over the head with it.
Will you stop questioning everything I do.
Well, everything you do is questionable.
[whispering] That's 808.
Hello?
Note sender?
You told us to come to 802. Are you there?
Are you dead?
He might be in the bathroom.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
[with deep voice] Sit on the bed.
You speak-- I thought you didn't speak.
Shut up. Sit on the bed.
-I'm sitting! -Shut up. Sit down.
We're gonna sit in front of the bed. All good.
I cannot keep his secrets anymore.
You mean the Colonel's, right?
The Colonel's secrets? I know, it's so hard to keep secrets.
It really is. You know, I have a friend named Gwen,
It really is. You know, I have a friend named Gwen, and she has a box that she keeps under her bed--
Look, don't give me that hairdresser shit.
Just shut up. Listen.
Copenhagen, 1994.
We were leaving a state dinner.
I did not see the bomber, but the Colonel did.
He threw his body across Mr. Quince.
He was hero.
For nine months, the Colonel lay in a coma.
And when he awoke,
he find his eye is not the only thing he lost.
They blew off his dick. I knew it. I knew it.
-His hand. His hand, honey. -The dick. He's saying the dick.
-No, no, no. -He doesn't have a hand!
-I'm no talk about dick! -All right.
I talk about her.
-Me? -Her?
No, no, no.
Madeleine... LeBoutillier.
The most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
She was the Colonel's fiancée when the bomb exploded.
And when he awoke...
she was Mr. Quince's wife.
What the hell is with this guy?
-What, honestly, is his problem? -Can he get his own woman maybe once?
And then she died.
-No! -[Nick groans]
In childbirth.
-No! -Damn.
The child died, too. A boy.
A boy who would have inherited it all.
After that, the Colonel never mentioned Madeleine again,
except for one night.
On the anniversary of her death,
he came to me, he was drinking. He say...
"Sergei."
He's doing impressions now.
"If you were to kill this Mr. Quince, how would you do it?"
And I say,
"Find isolated place, create confusion,
make sure there are others with motive."
I told him how to kill the man!
-Holy shit! This is incredible! -Thank you.
Okay. So the Colonel killed Malcolm and Tobey over lost love.
-Got it. Perfect. -This is insane.
Will you just say all of that one more time,
but can you say it from the top?
-I've gotta do a voice memo. -She screws this up a lot.
-Just ask Siri. -[Nick] Swipe it up.
-Swipe it up. -I did swipe up.
Say, "Siri, -I would like to make voice memo." -[overlapping chatter]
Get into wardrobe. You are in danger.
-Get in the wardrobe, you said? -You are in danger. Right now.
-Quickly. -[Audrey] Jesus. I don't know-- Ow!
And whatever you hear, do not come out till I say so.
-Yes, sir. -Yes.
[Sergei] You. What do you want?
No, they're not here. You should go.
[whispering] Where's the lamp?
-I left it outside. -Why isn't it in here?
-Now you like the lamp? You're ridiculous. -Well, we needed--
-[Audrey] Let me open the door. -[Nick] Wait, wait, wait!
Oh, thank God.
Killer... is...
[gasps] What?
[Audrey] Oh, God, no! No, no, no!
-[Nick groans] -Oh, my God!
Is he dead? Is he dead?
He's dead!
Do we call housekeeping?
-[pounding on door] -Oh! Honey! -[Nick] Oh, my God! -[screaming]
Lock the door!
[Audrey] Oh, God! -[Nick yells] -Oh, my God.
Go! Out of the window! -[thudding on door] -[Audrey] What are you doing?
-[thudding on door] -[Audrey] What are you doing?
[Nick] Okay, there's a ledge.
That's not a ledge, that's an edge!
-[Nick] Here we go. -[Audrey] Oh, my God.
-[Nick] Here we go. -[Audrey] Oh, my God. [Nick] I gotcha, a hundred percent. A hundred percent. Slow.
-[Nick] Oh, right there. -No! Oh, God.
[Nick] Come on. -Don't even look down. -Oh!
-Don't look down. -Oh, my God!
-Told you not to look down. -It's so far.
-[Nick] Oh, my God. -[yelps]
-[Nick] He flosses angrier than you! -[screaming]
[Nick] We got an empty room. Jackpot. -Okay, we're gonna get up on this letter. -Okay.
Ready? Go. [straining]
Oh, my God!
-You okay? Come on. -That was the scariest thing.
-We gotta go. All right. I love you. -Oh, my God.
-I love you. I'm so scared. -Let's go, let's go, let's go.
No, you're not going back out there.
-[Grace] Oh, yes! Finally! -Come here.
-Kiss me, Vik. -Oh!
Oh, kiss me. Kiss me here.
-Where? -Here.
-God, I love it. Quick, get me to the bed. -Jesus Christ.
-Get up. -Yes!
[stammering] I'm gonna drink you up like a milkshake without a straw!
Yeah. Wow!
-[Vik] That's right. -Vanilla milkshake!
[Vik] Vanilla, chocolate, whatever!
-Yeah! -Yeah!
-Here we go! -Wow!
[Vik] Yeah! I hope the hotel's got insurance for these springs
'cause I'm gonna bust this bed up.
[Grace] Oh, my God!
-You're much stronger than you look, Vik! -That's right!
-[Vik] You ready for this? -I don't know if I am!
-[Vik moans] -[Grace] Oh, Grace!
-Grace! Oh, Grace! -Huh? Why do you keep saying Grace?
Darling, it's the only thing that gets me in the mood.
[Grace] Grace! You look so good for your age!
-[Vik] So good for your age! Oh, God! -[Grace] Your skin is beautiful!
-[Grace] You have no wrinkles... -No wrinkles any-- Anywhere!
Oh, my God! Grace, you're so--
Oh, God!
-[whispers] Uh-oh. -[Grace] Vik. Mm-hmm?
What happened?
[Vik] Maybe we should, like, conversate a little bit.
Get to know each other. Know what I mean?
Like, eye to eye, really connect. Tell me about your favorite band.
[Grace] I'm going to the casino. Maybe I'll get lucky there.
Look, look, look! Please don't tell anybody about this
'cause I've got some mad sex cred in these parts, yeah.
[Vik] My people know me. I'll buy you a hat!
[Audrey] I can't believe this just happened.
Okay, okay.
All right. We gotta calm down.
-This has been a really weird day, huh? -Yeah.
Okay. Let's just get out of this place.
Absolutely. Someplace with beer though, please.
"I'll go buy you a hat."
[Nick] Sergei was trying to tell us the Colonel did it,
but then he gets shot. There's no way the Colonel shot him
'cause the Colonel was having a floss party.
Did you see how crazy he was going with the teeth flossing?
-I did. -What did he have in there? A buffet?
-Um... -Oh, my gosh.
-What's he saying? -I don't know.
Well, you took French in high school, didn't you?
I don't remember high school! What did you take in high school?
-Latin. -Oh, great. Who takes freakin' Latin?
-People who have a hot Latin teacher. -Shh!
Okay, so something, something...
Something cake. Something's frosted.
Okay. You're fired. You're fired.
-Okay, I told you-- -Excuse me, sir.
Could you translate that for us, please? S'il vous plaît?
[in French accent] Uh, the TV says that, uh... you are the most wanted... for...
for meurtre.
-No, no, no. -Okay, no, no. We...
This is a complete misunderstanding, okay?
We were just around... -We saw-- -...a lot of people that happened to die,
but we didn't murt.
You are to be arrested at first sight.
-Us? -So, here's what we do.
What are you talking about? What are you doing?
They can't track our SIM card now.
Yeah, then pull the SIM card out.
You don't just submerge our phones into a bucket of beer.
Now-- Now he's saying that madame is hairdresser,
you are, uh... police officer?
No, he's-- he's a detective.
Ah. No, he's not.
-Yes, he is. -Yes, I am! Yes, I am!
No, no, no. He says that you have, uh, confessed to lying about that you are detective.
What? No. Now he's making stuff up.
TV says you have failed your detective exam many, many times.
All right! Enough translato. That's not--
You're just improvising, pal, and it's getting weird.
What-- What is he talking about?
[Delacroix] I will repeat this message in English.
Nick Spitz... is many things, but not a detective.
Well, I heard that.
Did you lie to me?
I didn't-- I didn't lie.
-The guy-- The guy was-- -Oh, God. No, no, no.
[Nick] Whoa. Hey.
-No. -Hun, hun, hun.
This whole thing's just-- just very complicated.
Complicated, yeah. I thought people were simple.
[sighs] Audrey, please.
What? Did you lie about getting that raise, too?
[sighs] How are we affording this trip?
You made me feel like I had to take you on this honeymoon.
You told me you already booked this honeymoon.
You gave this to me. This was my anniversary gift.
-Okay. -You lied about that, too?
We'll get into all that, okay?
But right now, I gotta figure out how we're gonna get out of this situation.
You have to figure this out? What do you think I've been doing?
This is what I do for a living, sweetheart!
You're a goddamn hairdresser!
-I'm sorry. -Whoa.
-Where you going? -I need a minute.
-[police sirens wailing] -We don't have a minute! [Audrey] Just leave me alone. Don't you follow me.
[Audrey] Just leave me alone. Don't you follow me.
[Charles] You need to get out of Monte Carlo right away.
I got you into this, I'll help get you out. Come with me.
-[Charles] Now! We have to go. -[Audrey] Right.
-[Charles] Lake Como, back roads. -[driver] Yes, sir.
-[Charles] Where's Nick? -I don't know. I don't care.
[Nick] Jimmy boy, it's Nick.
Where are you? You guys are all over the news.
They say you killed three people.
Do you think that's possible?
With your aim? Hell, no.
Exactly. Now I'm gonna text you two international numbers.
Can you link them together so I can follow one from the other?
Are you trying to get my ass fired?
[sighs] But hell, yeah. Thank you.
There's one more thing I want you to check into for me.
[Audrey] What are we doing?
I just have to dash in for a quick appointment with my lawyer.
We're going to read Malcolm's will at the villa later on,
and I'm going to get what's mine.
Charles, that just sounded very suspicious.
What about this week doesn't?
Oh, God.
Oh, my God. Claritin.
This is Japanese Claritin.
Hello?
Charles?
Audrey!
-[Audrey] Ow! -God!
-[Audrey] Ow! -What the-- [Audrey] What the--
What are you doing here?
I followed Suzi here.
-Suzi's here? -Yes.
Okay, Cavendish came here to find Suzi. I'm telling you, Cavendish is in on this.
I know. I knew that!
Okay. I just found a box of Japanese Claritin
in the back of Cavendish's limo.
So what? They were planning this the whole damn time?
The whole time. This was their plan.
-So they kill Malcolm, they kill Tobey... -Yeah.
...before Malcolm has time to sign the new will.
-Right. -That way, Cavendish inherits everything.
And he splits it with Suzi.
And if they killed him after, then Suzi would have inherited.
-They still would have split that. -It was a win-win.
Oh, look at that. Who figured that whole thing out?
The hairdresser. Mm-mm. The hairdresser.
-[door closes] -[gasps]
-[Audrey yelps] -I got you!
Jesus! Oh, my God.
It's just like Death at the Library!
What happens in Death at the Library?
They died. That's why it's called Death at the Library.
Nick, what are you doing? [screams]
We are going to push this over on the count of three,
-and then we're gonna run. -We're gonna what?
-Don't you trust me? -No!
Ready? One!
Two!
Three!
Oh, look! There!
Oh! Sorry! Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry.
[Nick] Come on.
-Is that-- -Is that Juan Carlos?
-Juan Carlos! -Hey!
Hello!
-Juan Carlos! -How am I?
-No, no. Suzi! Suzi! -Suzi! Suzi! Which way is Suzi?
-Married to Malcolm. -You two married! Good!
-No! -No!
Suzi vidisti? Putamus esse illa interfectorem.
-Yes! -Latin, baby!
-Yes! -Latin, baby! -Still the international language! -I got it!
-Still the international language! -I got it!
[Audrey] Shit.
-Oh! -Yeah!
[Audrey] Where'd she go? She was right there.
You should have never come to Lake Como.
-Wait a minute. -We know about you and Cavendish.
-You know nothing. -[Audrey] We know you're still in love,
and we know that love is tough without money.
Isn't it, Suzi?
I'll take your word for it. You're the one whose shoes
I'll take your word for it. You're the one whose shoes still got a sticker from Marshalls on it.
-They have name brands now! -[Audrey] How dare you? -They have name brands now! -How dare you?
-[Nick] What? -These are from Target.
-How could you not tell me? -I don't look at your--
-Shut up! -[gasping]
-Oh! -Suzi, don't. Please, don't do this.
No matter what you do, you're not gonna be safe. I'm telling you.
One murderer always double-crosses the other murderer.
-She reads the books. -It's just a cliché of the genre!
-I'm telling you! -[gasps]
Hey! Halloween!
-[gasps] -[yelling] [Audrey] No, no, no! Oh, my God! Go, go, go!
Cavendish, you move, I'll blow your head off!
Shoot at him!
Oh, babe, you're the worst shot!
Those were warning shots, honey!
-Oh, yes! I go fast! -Go!
Ambulance! Emergencia!
Okay, Suzi. You've gotta tell me who did this.
Slow down. Don't use your words. Let's charade it, okay. Just tell me with your hand.
Let's charade it, okay. Just tell me with your hand.
Uh, claw. Bear claw.
No. Grizzly bear claw.
Oh! Chewy. Chewy.
So it's Sergei? No, Sergei's dead.
[Juan] Hey!
Have you got tires on your feet? Good God!
Spooning. Eating. Uh...
Ice cream. No, no. Gelato. Gelato?
Oh, God. It's amazing how pretty you are when you're-- I'm sorry.
Hey.
Hey! Come on!
Oh, shoot!
Hey!
Crazy... crazy... Crazy mad love!
It's crazy 'cause you're madly in love with Cavendish.
It's Cavendish, no? Sleeping With the Ene--
Sleeping. You're not sleeping.
-[Nick] She's dead now? -I don't know why this keeps happening!
[Nick] Let's go! We gotta get out of here.
-[Nick] Oh, my God. Come on. -[Audrey] Where?
Close the airports! Search house to house!
As God as my witness, I will find Nick and Audrey Spitz.
-Inspector? -Yes?
I have Nick and Audrey Spitz on the phone for you.
-Huh? -Nick and Audrey Spitz.
Where are you?
We are on our way to Quince's villa right now.
Oh, okay. [chuckles]
I'm sorry, I wasn't prepared for you to actually answer that.
We are being framed right now.
You meet us at the villa, we will reveal the killer.
That kinda rhymed. Which is cool, I think.
-[Audrey] Look at this place. -Let's go.
-[Audrey] Oh, my God. -This is big.
This is a big house. This is what they call rich people shit.
[Audrey] Lord Cavendish is expecting us.
Second floor, eighth door on the left.
Yes, that's right. That's what he told us, yeah.
Okay, so take a five-spotter.
Your five euros is how much American-wise?
Six American dollars.
Oh, that's, uh... that's more than I--
-Can I get a half a euro back-- -Oh, God. Please, Nick. Thank you.
I didn't know they were ahead of us with the money.
-[Audrey] Second floor... -I got no bullets left,
so we'll bluff 'em until Interpol gets here.
[Audrey] Honey, you just gotta be careful.
This guy has killed four people, that we know of.
[Nick] Good news is, we know who did it.
-Okay. -Hard part is over with.
Okay.
And...
What's up, Dish?
Stay still! I'll shoot you right in the six-pack!
-You hear me, bitch? -Calm down, babe.
Make a move! I dare you!
I dare-- Oh, my God!
-He's dead. -He's dead.
-Okay, he's dead. -Oh, my God.
-What the hell? -Oh, God. Case reopened, babe.
They must have poisoned his drink!
-Nick! -And look at his face. It's--
I mean, besides the foaming mouth, he still kinda looks good.
What is with this man?
We told the police. We called the police. We told 'em to come here.
-Yes. -We've got to stop them.
It's not like canceling a pizza, honey. You tell 'em to show up, they show up.
If he's not the killer, who is the killer?
And if we don't know who the killer is before they get here, we're screwed!
Do you understand this? He's gotta be here in this house.
This is gorgeous wallpaper. Is that fabric? Is this embossed?
Sweetheart, you're losing it! You're making me nuts right now!
No, I know. Hold on. Okay.
All right, it's good. You all right? You breathing?
-I have to breathe through this. -Look at me.
-We gotta turn ourselves in. -Wait, what?
They're all gonna show up. If we run, they're gonna shoot us.
What do you mean? We're gonna just go to jail?
It's better than getting shot, ain't it?
I don't feel-- I don't feel good.
-Babe. -Oh, God.
It's an Italian prison.
You know the food's gonna be incredible.
We'll have meatballs and pesto sauce and all that.
It's not co-ed, honey. All right?
We're-- We're not gonna be in jail together.
I know.
Why did you lie to me?
'Cause I was... I was, uh... I was embarrassed.
With me?
Why? I-- I could've helped you figure that out. That's why we're together.
I could've helped you figure that out. That's why we're together. I know.
Remember when I couldn't pay my rent at the salon,
and then you were like, "Oh, okay." You got that boot off my landlord's car.
-That got me another week. -Yeah, I remember.
Remember when your cholesterol was through the roof?
And then I made you eat egg whites? You hate egg whites.
And then I made you eat egg whites? You hate egg whites. And I made you do it, and I did it with you.
You helped me not miss yolks anymore.
That's right. That's what we do. We do things together.
So can we please just figure this out, too?
We just don't know who did it.
But Nick, we know who didn't do it. -All right? -Right.
-All right? -Right.
So let's just go downstairs and act like we figured it out.
If we're gonna do that, we gotta-- we just gotta look confident.
All right. If we're gonna look confident, we've gotta dress it.
I already know what I wanna wear.
What?
[Nick] What's up, fools?
Okay, we solved the case. Boom.
Yo, yo! Where'd you get the clothes? It's a little much.
Um... I found this beautiful dress in a random closet.
-You're looking gorgeous, by the way. -Thanks, baby.
-And he got this stunning tux... -Mm-hmm. ...off a...
Oh, why candy-coat it?
-A corpse. -Yeah.
There's another corpse?
Jeez! Sorry, yes. Upstairs, eighth door on the left.
[Colonel] To whom does this dead corpse belong?
Oh, yeah. You guys don't know.
-Bad news, guys. -It's terrible.
Cavendish is dead.
You stole the tux off Charlie's dead body?
And it fits perfectly. Little tight in the crotch, to be honest.
Just kidding. No, he's got me beat. He's got me beat.
Wait. Where's Suzi?
-She's dead. -Dead.
-Oh! -Oh, my God!
Y'all are like the miniature Manson Family!
-No, no, no. -Nick and Audrey Spitz,
-you are under arrest. -[Audrey] Listen.
Ferme la bouche. Is that what it is?
-Just give us a second. We got this. -We got this. Let's go.
[Nick] Thank you.
All right. Ladies and gentlemen, let's review the facts.
[Nick] Malcolm Quince, he was the first to get murdered.
We all assumed it was Tobey.
-No, we all assumed you did it. -Mm-hmm.
-Okay. -Yeah, but Tobey hated his father,
and he stood to inherit billions of dollars.
-Until he caught some lead to the dome. -Mm-hmm.
-Can you feel me, Raja? -Pew-pew-pew!
-There it is. -And then,
before Sergei was shot, he told us that the Colonel did it.
He told you what?
But we know you didn't do it, Colonel, because we saw you flossing your teeth
when we were shimmying by your window that night.
You two were spying on me in my bathroom?
Trust me, I did-- We saw a lot of shit that night that I did not want to see.
I mean, apologize ahead of time. We had to see you guys having sex.
You, um... You... saw that?
[Nick] Maharajah, some advice for you.
Maybe grab the bottom and squeeze.
Huh. Word.
Anyway...
French fries. Yes.
Actually, Juan Carlos, you had nothing to do with this.
You couldn't have had anything to do with it
because you were with us when Suzi got killed.
-[Nick] So it wasn't you. -[Audrey] Mm-mm.
-It wasn't you. -Mm-mm.
-It wasn't you. -[Audrey] No.
It wasn't you.
Holy shit! Maybe we did do it.
-What? -Did you?
-Because listen-- -What did you just say to me? -I'm just messing around. -There it is.
-I'm just messing around. -There it is. -And he's clapping. -Going to jail. Thanks, babe.
-And he's clapping. -Going to jail. Thanks, babe.
I'm glad we finally are all on the same page.
Now, since the first murder occurred in French territorial waters,
I will be taking you to Paris to be arraigned and tried.
At least we're going to Paris. You always wanted to go.
Honey, if you keep making jokes at a time like this,
it's not gonna make this go away.
[clears throat] Lucky for you, since 1977,
there has been no death penalty under French law.
[whispers] French law. [whispers] French law.
The French law. Yeah.
Surely, Inspector, you of all people
are familiar with the French inheritance law.
Are you implying I have bastard children?
Well, I wasn't.
Because I do. I was surprised you knew about them.
I love those little bastards. [chuckles]
Okay. Anyway, um, the French law states that a man's estate
must be divided equally amongst his children.
So it wouldn't matter what the will said.
Straight up, Maharajah.
The kids were gonna get the money, whether the old man married Suzi or not.
Mm-hmm. But both of Malcolm's children are dead.
-Both? -[Nick] Yes. Tobey,
-Both? -[Nick] Yes. Tobey, and the son he had with Madeleine LeBoutillier..
That boy died at childbirth.
Did he, Colonel?
I spoke to my partner in New York City.
I said, get the death certificates for Madeleine and the son.
He could only find one for Madeleine.
But then I started thinking, maybe there's no death certificate
because there was no death.
Nonsense. Malcolm desperately wanted a boy to sire the next generation of Quinces.
He would never abandon a son.
[stammering] But... what if it was a daughter?
-Yes! -What if it was a daughter?
The love of his life dies,
dies giving birth to his unwanted daughter.
-Yes! -It almost makes sense.
-It does! It kinda does! -It makes total sense.
He gave her away.
Then where is she now?
Well, she could be anywhere. She could have got married.
She could've joined a gang, changed her name. Who knows? Carry on.
She could've joined a gang, changed her name. Who knows? Carry on. -Changed her name. -Ah!
-You changed your name. -[Nick] Yes.
Your real last name isn't Ballard.
So? Lots of artists change their names.
Lady Gaga's real name isn't Lady Gaga.
Yes, Lady Gaga. "Paparazzi," yes, good.
But every Grace Ballard superfan knows your first movie was Summer Wetdown.
You had three lines, and you went by your birth name,
Grace Butler.
Which, en français, roughly translates to LeBoutillier.
Madeleine LeBoutillier, your mother.
This is a joke.
I wasn't even in the room when Malcolm Quince was murdered.
Fine! Then Tobey killed him, but he did it with a little help.
[Audrey] The lights. You turned out the lights.
[Nick] You convinced Tobey to kill Malcolm so you could split the money with him.
[Audrey] And then you killed Tobey so that you could just keep all of it.
Then me and this girl started asking too many questions.
So you had to get rid of us.
[Nick] Luckily, not for him, but Sergei gets in the way.
[Audrey] Then you seduce the Maharajah
so that you would make us think you were with him all night.
Yo, you were just twizzlin' on my wizzle for an alibi.
Girl, that's cold.
You tried to kill us in the library.
[Nick] You tried to kill us in the market, but you got Suzi instead.
-And the weapon... -Hm! -I recognize the weapon now. -[Audrey] The dart?
It was a movie. I watched it one night. You were out with your friends.
You came back drunk and, uh... What the hell was it?
Princess Blow Dart.
[Audrey] Oh, God.
That is not the name of a movie.
It is! It is!
Yo, look at my screensaver.
-[Vik] That's her! -[Audrey] Oh, my gosh!
So then you killed Charles
because you knew he would never rest until he found out who Suzi's killer was.
[Nick] 'Cause he loved Suzi, not you!
The three motives: money, love, revenge.
You were the mastermind
behind Malcolm Quince's murders, weren't you?
-And you were the one who framed us. -You killed them all, didn't you?
[Nick] Didn't you?
My father was a monster.
So you admit it?
Yes.
I am the daughter of Malcolm Quince and Madeleine LeBoutillier,
and sole heir to the Quince fortune.
Uh, and... what about the murders?
Oh, I didn't do those.
But it couldn't have happened to a nicer group of people.
[Delacroix] So... what other proof do you have?
-Of what? -Proof of what?
That she killed everybody?
Yes.
Aren't you gonna do anything at all?
I mean, is there a French holiday we're unaware of?
What the hell do you do?
Look... I don't know how you do things in Brooklyn,
but here we need evidence to make an arrest.
This is not how this is supposed to happen.
The detective is supposed to explain the murders, which we just did,
and then the killer is supposed to crack and freak out under pressure and admit it!
If there's nothing else, I'd like to start spending my money now.
The hat. The hat! Uh, take off your hat.
What?
I said take off your hat.
No.
The Maharajah bought me this hat, and I quite like it.
Nick hit the killer in the head with a plate.
And it left a mark, didn't it?
Also, why on earth would you put a hat on a freshly styled head of hair?
How would you know my hair's been freshly styled?
'Cause she's a goddamn hairdresser.
Please remove your hat, Ms. Butler.
I'll do nothing of the kind.
The butler did it. Grace Butler did it! Grace But-- Right?
-I said it on the plane. -You had to do it!
-[Grace] Stay back! -Jesus!
Everybody!
-Oh, my God! -Son of a bitch.
-Wait! No, no. -Whoa!
Nobody move! Nobody move, or I'll shoot her.
Guns down. Baissez vos armes.
[Delacroix] Get an ambulance.
Yo, I thought you said he was a terrible shot.
Not when it comes to saving my woman.
-I was aiming for her foot, by the way. -[gasps]
All right. It's all right.
Thank you for stepping in and trying to stop her, Juan Carlos.
That was so brave.
De nada, señora.
I love that. I love that he's brave and I'm, what, nothing?
-Are you kidding? I said you were brave. -You didn't say it.
I said so many times. "Nick, you were so brave."
[imitating Juan Carlos] De nada, señora. Halloween.
Yo, I got a question.
In the hotel in Monte Carlo, you said that you saw me and Grace together.
-We heard you. -We heard you.
We didn't like what we heard, but I'll tell--
-I'm sorry. -I hope those are new pants, by the way.
-[laughing] -Yeah, but... But the truth is,
Grace and I were together in the bar an hour before we got to our room,
so how could she have killed Sergei if she was with me?
Nick.
Audrey.
How did Juan Carlos understand my English just now?
[Delacroix] Stop!
No! No!
[Juan] Don't come any closer!
Aah! He speaks English!
I've spoken English my whole life, you idiots,
and a dozen other languages.
And by the way, your Latin sucks.
You understood it!
Don't you even think about it, Colonel, or I will shoot your dick off.
Put your hands up in the air, now.
I am the one who told her to convince Tobey to kill his dad,
destroy this sick family in the name of my father.
Get into the car.
-[policemen yell in Italian] -[Juan] Back off!
I go fast.
[Nick] Hey!
[Nick] Look at that! A Ferrari!
-What? -Testarossa!
Magnum P.I.! Me, baby! I got the mustache!
[Nick] This is incredible! This is a fantasy for everybody!
[Audrey] How does it open?
[Nick] Underneath! Pull! Pull! Come on!
Oh, my God.
What the--
-Are you kidding me? -I'm so sorry! I don't know what to say!
Go, go, go!
-Put your hands up. Hands up! -Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[Nick] All I'm saying is,
when the engine sounds like your sister's voice--
irritating, high, and loud-- you gotta switch gears.
[Nick] Yes!
Look how nice you handle this thing!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Honey, he's right up there. -I see him.
Again!
Yeah! Baby, nice. Nice! Nice turn!
[Nick] Look at you! Look at you!
Keep going. Keep after him. Keep after him. Keep going.
-Goat! Goat! Goat! -[yells]
Holy cow!
Do you have any idea how gorgeous you look?
Wait! Second goat! What the hell?
-Do you not like goats or something? -I love them!
Idiots.
Oh, shit.
♪ Too many women with too many pills... ♪ Keep going, baby. Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
-Holy shit! -Oh, God!
-We gotta pit him, honey. -I gotta what him?
What you do is you hit the back bumper and he'll just spin out.
-I can't do that. I can't-- -You got this.
I can't. He's a Formula 1 race car driver!
Faster! Come on!
-[Audrey whimpers] -This is our adventure.
Go for it.
I can do this. I love you. That was sweet.
Okay, here we go.
No!
He didn't spin. He didn't spin. We just gotta take him out. -Take him out! -Here we go.
-Take him out! -Here we go. Floor it! Floor it!
What?
Hit the brakes! Hit the brakes! Hit the brakes!
Do you have any idea how cool you are?
-Happy anniversary, baby! -Yeah. Oh!
Oh, my God.
-Okay. -Okay.
-I'm gonna go get that guy out of the car. -Go get him.
[both] I love you.
-I love you. -Oh, my God.
Let's go. Let's go. I got you. Come on.
I got you. Come on.
-All right. -[Delacroix groans]
[Juan] I'm so sick of you, cop!
You should have never come here!
You should have just stayed home, eating hot dogs,
reading People magazine, and watching reality TV.
[Audrey] Baby.
You know, that was our-- That was our tour bus!
[woman] No toilets, no Wi-Fi, and you're running over people?
-Brittany's hogging the window seat! -I want to see the dead guy!
Just sit down and shut up! I'm gonna take a picture!
-All right. I love you. -Oh, my God, this guy--
-We gotta ask 'em how they age ham. -I don't care!
[Nick] Come on! ♪ Do you love me too... ♪
[Delacroix] On behalf of Interpol, I thank you, Mrs. Spitz.
You are as brilliant as you are beautiful.
[Audrey] Oh, my gosh. Well, thank you for that.
-[Delacroix] And Officer Spitz. -[Nick] I go, what? What?
It seems you are quite the detective after all.
-[Audrey] You are! -With this girl, yes.
Something I will be passing along to your superiors in New York.
That would be big.
I have to tell you, I think this entire experience was pretty great.
-Incredible. -Yeah.
Outside of the murders, it was on the money.
Well, I hope the rest of your trip, which we have arranged for you,
is more relaxing.
-Bon voyage. -Well, thank you.
You owe that to us, but thank you so much.
You ever come to New York, you look us up.
We'll pin, uh, a triple homicide on you or a kidnapping or something.
-Thank you. Okay. -Thank you so much.
Good to meet you. All right. Be safe.
-Good anniversary, right? -Amazing anniversary.
-Kind of-- Kind of a cool one. -Loved it!
What did you get me, by the way, for a present?
What? Oh, uh...
I got you the Amazon gift card.
SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT
Are you all right?
I'm doing what I can.
And what's that?
FRIDAY, OCTOBER 16 ALARM
Paula, watch out. Slow down. There's something there.
Someone's there.
Simón.
Simón!
Hello?
Are you all right?
No.
-Wait. -Hey. Wait. Hey!
Look out!
Slow down!
Stop! Stop!
-Look out. -Stop! Stop!
-Are you okay? -Yes.
Are you okay?
-I'm calling an ambulance. -There's no time. Get the car.
She's in a critical state. We should've waited for the ambulance.
On the contrary.
You saved her by bringing her in so quickly.
I didn't think the motorbike touched her.
That wasn't the issue.
She was already very sick when you found her.
What's the matter with her?
We're still running tests.
-What about her parents? -We're trying to locate them.
We haven't had any reports of missing girls in the area.
Were you able to talk to her when you found her?
Did she say anything?
-Nothing. -No. Nothing.
ALARM
How do you know her name is Clara if she doesn't talk?
It's the name of one of the nurses.
We saw that she reacted when she heard the name.
-Has she said anything? -Nothing.
-Why isn't she talking? -We don't know yet.
There are many forms of mutism and many things that can cause it.
How did she get so sick? Do you know what caused it?
There are still unanswered questions.
What's important is that the doctors say she's responding well to the treatment.
And we'll soon be able to say she's a healthy girl.
What happened?
Why the sudden change? Did something happen with any of the kids?
Hey, hey.
Okay, okay.
Do you want us to stay here?
Clara?
Yes? Is your name Clara?
We'll stay here.
-How do they know her age? -Thanks to an X-ray they did on her wrist.
And her parents?
They can't find them.
Have they said anything else?
No.
They don't know much, and they haven't said much either.
Dear God. What could they have done to the poor thing?
Awful.
Was she abused?
No.
She'll have to stay in the hospital for a while?
She's very sick.
Her kidneys barely work.
They don't know if it's genetic or…
How terrible.
That's why it's so important to find her parents.
They should cut off those people's balls.
Leave it there for her.
Excuse me. Is she not feeling well?
She's sedated.
Why is she restrained?
It's for safety reasons.
Simón.
You can't remove those.
-Clara. -I'm sorry.
You can't be here.
Please.
NOBODY CLAIMS THE GIRL FROM THE ROAD
POLICE STILL INVESTIGATING WHERE SHE CAME FROM TWO WEEKS LATER
Come on. I'm in a hurry.
Paula, I'm gonna be late.
Coming.
Should I pick you up to go see Clara?
Huh?
Simón, should I pick you up?
Yeah.
Aren't you in a hurry?
Want some?
Thanks.
What?
I can't stop thinking about that girl.
Her kidneys are finally responding.
She's improved a lot, thanks to you.
And her parents? Any news?
We still don't know anything.
It's like that chalk square is this table.
Inside, everything's fine.
But if we force her to come out…
it pushes Clara over the edge.
Clara isn't doing well at the hospital.
To help her, we need her to establish connections and feel safe.
It's a huge responsibility, but she's started to form a bond with you,
and we want to take advantage of that to help her find her family.
This is more complicated than fostering.
Foster parents usually have a training period.
We don't have time for that. She's our main priority.
Especially considering she can't go outside.
We know.
I've been completely honest.
I've laid out the situation as it is.
Think it through. If you agree, we'll start the paperwork.
Paula, have the doctors approved this?
Yes.
I think that girl should be in a hospital, under the care of professionals.
I know, but she's not doing well there, and this option came up.
It's only a few days. Let's see how it goes.
-Have you thought this through? -Yes.
We both have.
So it's final. Isn't it?
-She's arriving tonight. -Tonight?
We'd better leave you to it. You must have a lot to do.
Yes.
Simón.
Simón.
She's seen the chalk square.
Good morning, Clara.
Want some?
-Do you want some? -Yes.
Tasty?
Delicious.
So good.
The yogurt is delicious.
-As always. -Yup.
Good night.
Clara.
Would you come with me?
It's in all her drawings.
She's probably been doing it since she was little.
I want you to come outside and play with me.
You don't want to?
Clara, I'm going to erase this.
Gloria, don't.
Wait in the kitchen.
-That won't be necessary. -Yes, it will.
Come on.
Look at me.
Over here.
I'm going to count to three, and we're going to erase the chalk line.
One.
Two.
Don't be afraid.
And…
three.
Are you hurt?
Come on. Let her work.
Breathe.
Clara!
-Clara! -Stop.
Clara,
I know you understand me.
And I know you can talk.
You said "buma" earlier.
What does "buma" mean?
Please.
What is that? I don't understand.
Where is your house?
House, kreide.
"Kreide"? What does "kreide" mean?
-Kreide. -Kreide.
Where is your house? Is it far?
Is it near?
Who do you live with?
Mom.
You live with your mom.
Mom.
Who else? Do you live with your dad?
Clara, who do you live with?
If you don't want to talk to me, I'll have to erase the chalk.
Clara.
Hello.
I won't force you to talk.
I know you're afraid of crossing the chalk line, but…
But we don't have to do it.
Clara, while you're here with Simón and me,
nothing bad will happen to you.
I promise.
We'll stay here.
What's this?
Is it for me?
It's beautiful.
I love your gift.
-Look at all this stuff. -Don't step on the chalk, please.
We thought she couldn't talk.
-Yeah, so did we. -We were all surprised.
-And what has she said? -Random words. Hardly understandable.
The psychologist thinks she'll improve.
She said "mom." She must've lived with her.
-And the father? -She hasn't said anything about him.
What will you do? Teach her how to speak?
It might be more about her gaining confidence--
We're missing a glass.
-Oh, yes. -No, no. I'll go. I'll go.
Thank you.
I'm sorry. I'm all over the place.
You're making good progress.
It's all thanks to Paula. The girl adores her.
Ainhoa is dying to meet Clara.
Is she?
It might be good for her to play with other kids.
We can come around before the match.
We can have breakfast at nine.
Okay.
Maybe you were a bit too intense.
Come on, go play with her.
She just had to meet Clara.
I can't believe how big she is.
Neither can I.
You look a lot better.
I'm really happy for you, Paula.
-Would you like another piece of toast? -No, look at me. I'm bursting.
Girls.
Come have breakfast.
Girls.
What's wrong?
How is she?
Fine, I just dropped her off at home.
Come.
Look what I found.
These were in the jam.
Seven, counting the one Claudia almost swallowed.
Look at the jar.
It looks fine to me.
Exactly.
-Simón-- -Someone put the glass in it.
"Someone"?
No.
Don't you at least need it explained?
Explain what? That there was glass in a glass jar?
Come on.
-Should we call Gloria and tell her? -No, we'll tell her tomorrow.
What a mess you've made.
I'll be right back.
Remember to buy some chalk, please.
What's wrong?
Look.
"Kreide"? What does "kreide" mean?
Please.
What is that? I don't understand.
Please.

I don't want her to misinterpret it.

The washing machine broke down.
Everything is fine.
Hey.

Is it a thing?
Is it a person?
Talk to me, Clara.
Is it a place?
Okay, should we draw it?
Let's draw it.
Let's put it here…
Look.
Hey, that's enough, okay?
Talk to me, please.
Clara.
Clara, it's up to you. Speak or come out of the chalk line.
You know how to do both.
Should I erase it?
Hey.
Listen to me, hey.
Clara. I won't erase it.
I'm sorry.
Has Clara hit you?
-No. -She hasn't attacked you?
Well, I forced her a bit to make her talk,
it was my fault.
What about the glass shards? A pregnant woman ended up in hospital.
We were going to tell you tomorrow.
Yes, it was just a scare.
She understands when I speak German to her, but…
she hasn't said anything.
Clara.
Why don't you wanna talk anymore?
Did anything happen that might have made you angry or sad?
She made this lovely drawing.
Can I see it?
I think it's for Paula.
Can I see it, honey?
Is that your house?
Grass. You live in the countryside?
That's the sky, then.
Why is it green?
Huh?
I don't know, why don't you--?
-We'll talk in a couple of days. -We're fine, really.
She's starting to trust me.
This is not working. I'm sorry.
Please, don't.
It's not your fault.
We'll start doing the paperwork.
Were you gonna tell me Clara had hit you?
Look, she didn't hit me. She's six years old.
-Where are you going? -I'll be right back.
-We're talking. -Look after Clara.
Paula!
You told everybody and now they're gonna take her away.

Clara!
Clara!
They found her jacket.
Where was it?
In the lake.
The divers are still looking.
-What happened then? -She…
She was holding me.
I locked her in so I could go to the bathroom.
You locked her in?
Yes, with chalk.
How long were you in the bathroom?
Less than five minutes.
When I came out,
the door was open and…
And Clara was gone.
-Were you alone in the house? -Yes.
I had gone to work.
There was a prior glass shards incident.
Yes, we didn't make much of it.
Your neighbor ended up in the ER. That kind of accident should be reported.
I knew about it, and was considering how to deal with it.
-It seems the girl went out on her own. -No, that's impossible.
Because the girl never leaves the chalk line.
Exactly.
We were told she disappeared from the house on another occasion.
You went out to look for her.
No, I think she never left.
I think…
-She hid. -Yeah.
You dealt with that too?
Look, I've spent a lot of time with Clara, and I know she was doing well here.
While you continue searching the reservoir,
please,
consider other options.
All right.
Stay put.
In case she comes back.
-You need to talk to Paula. -Yeah, I know.
I've never seen her like this.
What's important now is for her to get back to normal.
-Do you also think someone took the girl? -No. I don't know.
I hope she's not at the bottom of the lake.
Don't say that.
Paula.
How are you?
Fine.
Any news?
Relax, you've only slept for two hours.
You had time to tidy up.
Well, how are you?
When will you return to the office? They'll start taking away your projects.
It's always nice to get back to normal, Paula.
You know I'm due sooner than expected?
Really?
-It'll be born on the same day as Beltrán. -They told us on the way here.
What a coincidence.
What?
I don't know, Paula.
What do you think?
What do I think?
I'm really happy for you, Beltrán.
-They only meant to cheer you up. -You shut up.
-Paula, calm down. -Hey.
-Can you get out of my house, please? -Paula.
Can you all go?
I'll see you out.
I'm sorry.
Simón, I'm anxious.
-Where could she be? -I don't know.
Well,
I can't sit around waiting.
Can you stay, please?
If they find her, I don't want her coming back here.
-What? -The girl wasn't okay here.
Yes, I heard you earlier.
For the others to say it is one thing, but you…
-You think she got up and left? -How long have you been injecting?
-What? -How many cycles are you on?
You returned to the clinic on your own.
I thought getting pregnant was something we'd do together.
-Aren't you gonna say something? -I haven't returned to the clinic.
The shots were in the bathroom. Hidden, but they were there.
It's what I had left over from the previous treatment.
So you just did one cycle?
-I planned to. -How many?
I planned to do one, but it didn't work.
-And I thought I could do another one. -You won't give me an answer.
One moment, Simón.
You're right. I should've told you, but I didn't want you to worry.
-How could you? -I couldn't take it anymore.
We had discussed it. We agreed we'd stop for a year and see.
I'm sorry, I couldn't.
We've gone through six years of treatments and doctors.
Don't you remember what it was like for us?
Yes.
-Exhausting. -No.
We were in bad shape.
So…
you still think you're alone in this?
I never did.
You just said you didn't want me to worry.
I don't.
I wish I could've done more.
Carried the load.
We're in this together, honey. I mean it.
I'll say it again, "Why?"
I wanted to sit you down one day and say,
"Hey, we're pregnant."
No.
Yes. As simple and as hard as that.
But it was your decision.
Yours alone.
I felt strong enough.
If I'm not strong enough, how can you be?
We're different.
Yes.
You took this thing you say we're in together
and made it your own.
Same thing you did with the girl.
What? I'm lost.
What has Clara got to do with all this?
You didn't let me in, Paula.
You became obsessed and locked me out from the start.
I don't agree.
-You don't? -No.
We sleep in separate beds.
You attack whoever disagrees with you and hide things from me.
-I'm not hiding anything. -She hit you.
-She didn't hit me. She's six. -She ran away.
-She hid. -It doesn't matter what I say.
I forced her to speak. That's it.
You'll always find a reason, don't you see?
Do you know what my only reason is right now?
What?
-That I devoted myself to the girl. -And I didn't.
I accepted the responsibility we had. That's not the same as becoming obsessed.
No, you insisted on keeping that girl in this house
when they should've taken her weeks ago.
-That's what's going on. -That's your idea of parenting?
I'm not her father.
And I'm not her mother.
I don't get why you wanted to take her in.
-The truth? -Please.
I thought it'd be good for us. Especially you.
And you're saying I neglected you?
Can you explain this too?
Explain it to me.
Take a shower and eat something.
Yes?
Hello?
Mom?
Clara?
Clara, where are you?
Mom.
Are you okay?
What-- What's wrong, dear?
Okay, all right.
Goodbye.
Any news?
We're looking into cases all around Europe.
We'll leave no stone unturned.
Have you traced the call?
We only know the number from which the call was made.
Have you had your phone stolen recently?
-No. -Then you made the call?
Of course not.
Is it your cell phone number?
Yes, that's my number.
Simón,
she called me.
Please, help me explain. You were there.
No. Paula, I had left.
You're gonna get a psychological examination.
I don't need a psychologist.
And then you'll tell us everything you know.
The worst thing we can do for the girl is waste time.
Look,
I told you earlier.
I clearly heard her saying "Mom."
Full name?
Paula Ejea Guzmán.
-Age? -42 years old.
You have to leave your phone with us.
You're free to go.
Please stay reachable.
Let's go home.
I need to go for a walk.
-I'll go with you. -I have to think about all this.
Let's think together.
-Paula. -We'll talk about it tonight, I promise.

If you're not a police officer, she can't help you.

Then you have to help me.

NO NEW LEADS IN CASE OF GIRL WHO WENT MISSING FROM A BEACH IN MÁLAGA
A YEAR HAS PASSED SINCE THE DISAPPEARANCE
OF THE SWISS GIRL IN PEDRALEJO BEACH
12 YEARS OLD
"SHE'S OUR ONLY CHILD,
I BEG YOU"
"CIVIL GUARD HASN'T REVEALED WHETHER THE PARENTS ARE SUSPECTS OF CHILD ABUSE"
It happened on a beach in Málaga on June 5th, 2011.
All trace of Ingrid Morand was lost.
A year later, her parents haven't given up hope of finding her.
She's very generous and has a great imagination.
I'm sure she really misses her room.
Please, bring our Ingrid back.
She's our only child.
She's always making crafts to give us and her friends.
She says they are guardian angels
and that they protect us from harm--
…guardian angels and that they protect us from harm.
Simón?
Simón!
I'M AT THE POLICE STATION. CALL ME.
Emergency services.
My name is Paula Ejea.
My neighbor, Eduardo Olivares, may be involved
in the disappearance of a child. Please, you have to come.
-Is your daughter missing? -No, she's not my daughter.
But my neighbor, Eduardo Olivares, may know something about her disappearance
and that of another girl, Ingrid Morand.
Please, you have to come. My address is--
I see it on my screen. Units are on their way.
Wait inside your house, please.
No, stand up.
Stand up.
You can walk.
Go that way, towards those blue and red lights.
You mustn't talk.
Let me see you go.
I'll come back for you, but now you're sick.
Look.
See?
Follow the chalk line.
Follow the chalk line.
Have the doctors approved this?
Have the doctors approved this?
That girl should be in a hospital, under the care of professionals.
Have the doctors approved this?
-And what has she said? -Random words. Hardly understandable.
The psychologist thinks she'll improve.
She said "mom." She must've lived with her.
-And the father? -She hasn't said anything about him.
What will you do? Teach her how to speak?
It might be more about her gaining confidence--
We're missing a glass.
-Oh, yes. -No, no. I'll go. I'll go.
Thank you.
I'm sorry. I'm all over the place.
It's all thanks to Paula. The girl adores her.
Clara?
What are you doing here on your own? Want a glass of water?
What have you been up to? Were you drawing?
-Good morning. -Hello.
Everything is fine.
-Are there seconds? -No, but I can fix you something else.
It's okay.
Get me the leftovers from the fridge.
It's no trouble.
Should I make you an omelet?
The leftovers from the fridge will be fine.
Maite?
What?
I had put those beans aside for tomorrow.
Why is that?
Don't you remember?
I won't be in for lunch. You'll be on your own.
-And where will you be? -I'm going to Barcelona to see the boys.
I told you they'd finished their exams.
You didn't tell me.
Don't you remember?
You gave me permission. You said you didn't mind.
No.
You even told me where to have lunch, at that place in La Barceloneta
you went to with your workmates.
Well, as you wish.
We'd also arranged to meet Paula and Simón tomorrow.
You can go without me, can't you?
How about you call the boys? Huh?
Tell them to come here instead. They haven't been here in a while.
They must be really busy.
Didn't you just say they finished their exams?
They'll have started the second term. You know they don't stop.
They can make time to come spend two days at home.
You're right.
Paula and Simón aren't doing well.
I'll make the trip another time.
Are you sure?
Yes.
-Do you have work to do? -Yes.
And the Civil Guard?
They are stumped.
Okay, but what have they said?
Well, they think she's escaped,
but one detective is listening to Paula
and they're investigating a possible abduction.
What's important now is for her to get back to normal.
-Do you also think someone took the girl? -No. I don't know.
I hope she's not at the bottom of the lake.
Don't say that.
Paula.
How are you?
Fine.
Any news?
Relax, you've only slept for two hours.
You had time to tidy up.
Well, how are you?
When will you return to the office? They'll start taking away your projects.
It's always nice to get back to normal, Paula.
Tell her. She'll be glad to hear it.
You know I'm due sooner than expected?
Really?
-It'll be born on the same day as Beltrán. -They told us on the way here.
What a coincidence.
What?
I don't know, Paula. What do you think?
What do I think?
I'm really happy for you, Beltrán.
They only meant to cheer you up.
You shut up.
-Paula, calm down. -Hey.
-Can you get out of my house, please? -Paula.
Can you all go?
Come on, let's go.
I'll see you out.
Hello?
Hello.
Is everything okay?
Yes.
Are you alone?
Yeah.
Why?
Maite said I should come pick something up.
What's that?
Some maps.
She said I could borrow them.
She didn't say anything.
Come in.
We'll look for them.
Let's see if they're here.
What are the maps for?
I'm going to keep searching.
For the girl?
Yes.
Do you have any news?
Nothing.
That Maite…
Wait a second, I'll see if they're here.
-Yes? -Are you Eduardo Olivares?
Yes, that's me.
We received a call.
We'd like to ask you some questions if that's okay.
Paula Ejea called you, didn't she?
Please, don't stay there. Come in.
I told the police.
They didn't believe you.
They'll find me.
Tell me, Paula, how did you know?
I found Ingrid.
You found Ingrid?
I have her autopsy.
Where?
Where, Paula?
It's in…
It's all in my car.
Are you lying to me?
-You're lying to me. -No.
Paula?
Clara, listen to me, please.
This is very important. I need your help.
Would you like to help me?
Watch carefully.
Look.
Clara, here it goes.
Far.
I have!
Start, please. We can stop if you want.
No. Don't want.
Clara, listen to me.
Don't be afraid, please.
I know it's hard, honey.
But you will make it.
Do you know why? Because you're the bravest girl I've ever met.
I've never met anyone as brave as you are.
Please, Clara.
Do it for both of us.
Clara, are you in the closet?
I don't want. Mom punishment here.
Was your mom here?
Is your mom's name Ingrid?
Where is she?
Clara?
Honey.
Where is she?
Where is she?!
Where is she?
Tell me.
Where is she?
Clara!
Clara!
Clara, no!
Clara!
Simón!
Simón!
Simón!
Simón!
Simón!
Simón!
Simón!
Yes, I just got home, and she's not here.
Simón!
How would she reach me if they took her phone?
-Simón! -Hello?
What are you doing here?
Are you Clara?
Are you all right?
Where's Paula?
Calm down.
Easy, easy.
It's okay.
Easy. Come here.
Come.
Easy.
Easy, easy.
Simón!
What do you mean, "Stay at home"? No, no, you listen to me!
Here's what's gonna happen.
I'll go to see them whenever I want.
You'll give me money for the tickets and food…
I'll go and I'll return.
I'll be here, as usual.
But you'll never ask about them again, and they'll never have to come back.
And the basement?
Thank you.
I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for my sons.
What now?
Now I'll brew some coffee.
I'll be in the garden.
Civil Guard! Hands in the air! Don't move!
Where are they?
Didn't you hear me? Where are they?
Hello.
How are you?
Fine.
Fine? Oh, I'm so glad to see you, dear.
Me too.
How is your grandmother?
Oma?
You'll have to put her on later, so I can say hi.
What a lovely day in Hamburg.
It's sunny.
Look, it's very cloudy here today, see?
Is your ankle better?
Can you walk--? Wow.
That's wonderful.
Simón.
Look who's just arrived. Wait a second.
Moments we keep going back to.
My life before him was so simple and decided.
And now after him...
there's just...
after.
[woman calling] Tessa!
Okay, what are we forgetting?
-Hair dryer? -Nope.
-Flashlight? -Mom, it's college, not a survival course.
Towels, battery charger, phone charger--
I can always drive anything up you forget.
[mom] We should get going, we've a long drive ahead.
-Okay. -Let's do a last-minute room check.
Oh, wait.
Ah, thank you.
We're on the right floor.
Twenty-two...
B-twenty...
B-22.
Twenty-two.
Hey.
Hey.
Steph?
In the flesh.
I'm Tessa.
Hey, it's my new roomie.
This is Tristan.
-Hey. -Hi.
-I'm Tessa. -Come in. We're not gonna bite.
Oh, sorry. So this is my mom
and this is Noah.
Hello. Hi.
Full disclosure, I was pretty bummed to be paired with a freshman,
then I thought, hello, bright side,
I'm gonna be your spirit guide.
We can get you into all the best places even without a fake, no problem.
Mom?
I like your sweater.
Thanks. I got it from the GAP.
Cute.
We're going to the housing office right now
-and requesting a room change. -What are you talking about?
That room reeked of weed and you are not--
Can you please not make a scene?
I'm not.
We've worked too hard for this and I don't want you to be distracted by anyone.
Mom, this is me that we're talking about.
Can you please just trust me?
It'll be fine, I promise.
I promise.
The house will be so empty without you.
I know. I'll miss you.
Oh God, I am so proud of you.
Thanks, Mom.
Okay, I love you, my baby.
I'm going. See you later.
-Bye. -[sighs]
I got it.
This is the part I've been dreading.
Me too.
I actually meant the ride home with your mom.
Mm. Okay.
How much did I freak your mom out?
She thinks I'll be a bad influence?
She's just very protective.
It's always only been the two of us.
No, no thanks.
See? Seems like she has nothing to worry about.
Your brother is cute.
Oh, you mean Noah. No, he's my boyfriend.
Shit, sorry.
No, it's okay.
He's a senior in high school.
It's Tristan. I'm supposed to meet her.
What's with all the old books?
Who brings books to college?
Me... I guess.
The bookish vibe, I like that.
Alright, I'm out. Okay, bye.
-Hi. -Hey.
-Econ 101? -Yeah.
It's locked.
-Yeah. -[Tessa laughs]
-I already tried it. -Yeah.
[tutor] A couple of early birds, huh?
Have fun in there.
-Oh. -Sorry.
[both] After you.
No, honestly, I insist. No, I insist.
-My mother raised me to be-- -Okay.
-Are you in first year too? -Yeah.
Are you an econ major?
That's the plan.
You?
An English major.
-I'm Landon, by the way. -Tessa.
-Hi. -Hi. Nice to meet you.
[lecturer] Good morning. I'm Professor Alexander,
and welcome to Econ 101.
This might be the most important class you take here,
so I expect everyone here
to closely pay attention
and benefit from the 25-year career I had on Wall Street.
Now let's get started.
Er, excuse me?
I think that you're in the wrong room.
I'm in the right room.
How did you even get in here?
Okay.
Will you please go out into the hall so I can get dressed?
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm not looking.
[guy] You took your time.
The key... oh! Hey, Tessa.
Hi. Er...
Can you please ask your boyfriend to leave so I can get dressed?
Not my boyfriend.
-What did you say to her? -Nothing.
I've been minding my own business.
Okay, well... whoever he is.
You're going out with us tonight.
-Yeah, I don't know. -Trying to picture this one at a party.
Just not seeing it.
You're not gonna stay in here forever, right?
Nope.
[guy] The Great Gatsby. It's a good book.
Hate to spoil it...
but it was all a dream.
Actually...
it was all a lie.
[guy] Good to see you again.
[girl] Hello.
Can I get a cappuccino with almond milk
and cinnamon on top?
-Sure thing. -Regular black coffee, please.
-[server] For you? -[guy] An Americano, please.
[server] No problem.
-Thanks. -You're such a player.
Thank you.
Guess what? Shh.
We're gonna go to a party tonight.
I don't know.
You're going.
-Don't you wanna have fun? -[someone] Shh.
You shh.
Yeah, of course I do.
Then grab your shit. [whispering] Yes, okay.
[Steph] Let's get ready to party!
What do you think?
What?
It's... it's pretty.
Maybe it's just...
a little too formal.
You said be myself.
Know what? I love it.
I love it.
Oh, it's gonna be crazy. Hey!
Hey, what's up?
[crowd shouts] Chug! Chug! Oh chug, chug.
[Steph] There's my baby.
Hey, I'm not done.
-Hey, Tessa. -Hi.
I need things to be way less in focus.
-You've gotta take care of it. -[yells, laughs]
Do that again.
[guy] Again? I'm dying here.
Do it! I wanna get it on camera.
-[exhales] -[laughing] Sick, bro.
[Steph] Hey, guys.
This is my new roommate, Tessa.
This is everybody.
Nice to meet you,
my name is Zed.
[Steph] You've met Hardin, that's Molly.
Hey.
Wanna sit down?
Cute dress. [laughs]
Oh yeah, and that's Jace the Townie.
What's up?
What's your major, Tessa?
I'm thinking business or maybe economics.
Very cool.
You want a drink?
I don't really drink.
Come on, we're all drinking. Have a drink.
Just...
[Jace] Do it, come on.
My God, Steph, where'd you find this girl?
No one's talking to you.
[Jace] Oh, yes.
[Zed] You okay?
Okay, so guys...
truth or dare.
-[Zed] What? -Truth or dare.
-No. No. -[Molly] Come on.
-Isn't this a kid's game? -[giggles]
Not the way we play.
[Jace] Hey Tessa, truth or dare?
Truth.
Craziest place you've had sex.
Pass.
Why? It's an easy one.
Wait.
Are you a virgin?
-I'll do dare. -[Jace] Dare!
I dare you to make out with Hardin.
[Molly] She won't do it.
[Jace] This never ends well.
Do you wanna do this?
[Jace] Having fun, Molly?
I'm done playing this game.
[Molly] Oh, it sucks to suck.
I like this girl. Hardin Scott
got his first rejection.
[Jace] Denied, bro.
-Hey. -[Noah] Hey. Thought we were gonna FaceTime.
Yeah, sorry.
Where are you right now? It's really loud.
Um, I'm with Steph and her friends.
But they're all just like...
I don't know.
So you're at a party.
Have you been drinking?
I just had one drink.
Okay, so you go to college and now you drink.
That's really great, Tessa.
Noah, can you not be so like...
So like what? I'm not the one out partying right now.
-Just forget it. -Tessa, I want--
My bad.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You looking for something?
Are you drunk?
I don't drink.
Just like you don't.
"He's more myself than I am.
Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same."
It's Brontë, Theresa.
I know it's Brontë.
And my name is Tessa.
What are you doing in my room, Tessa?
Your room?
Yes.
Are we still playing?
'Cause I think you owe me a dare.
W...
Wait.
I can't.
I need to go.
[guy, playing game] I've got this. Look, here we go!
[second guy] Oh! Nice shot alright.
Hi.
Glad I'm not the only freshman here. Yeah, I'm psyched I got in.
Alright, folks...
let's get started.
Jane Austen's masterpiece...
Who in here has already read Pride and Prejudice?
What did you think of it on the first read?
Let's hear from our newcomer, Mr. Scott.
[Hardin] Pride and Prejudice.
Elizabeth Bennett needs to chill.
She gave Darcy a worse time than he deserved.
Are you saying that Darcy was not in love with Elizabeth?
Love is just a transaction.
We're all hardwired to desire.
We present the correct set of desirable traits and boom.
We can turn it on
and we can turn it off.
Yes, Miss...
Young? Tessa?
I think that it was the most revolutionary feminist novel that I've ever read,
feminist novel that I've ever read,
that a woman of that era
had the strength to reject Darcy when he treated her poorly.
That's a load.
[Hardin] It was Darcy's attitude
that attracted Elizabeth to him.
Darcy's attitude was rude and mocking.
He was lucky to be with a woman with as much integrity as Elizabeth.
The only reason he asked her to marry him was 'cause
-she wouldn't stop throwing herself-- -Throwing herself at him?
He was pursuing her. She's not satisfied with her life
and is looking for excitement wherever she can get it.
I think that it's obviously all in his head
that she had any feelings for him at all.
Well, there you have it.
That is the power of a good book.
That was exciting.
No, it was annoying.
I enjoyed it.
Look, whatever you're thinking, don't.
Nothing happened between us, okay? I have a boyfriend.
Us?
I thought we were talking about Pride and Prejudice.
Hey. Er...
Do you wanna go for coffee?
How can someone be so arrogant?
"Oh, Elizabeth Bennet needs to chill."
Like, who even says that?
That's just Hardin being Hardin.
-You know him? -Yeah.
We're...
we're practically related.
My mom is dating Chancellor Scott.
Chancellor Scott is Hardin's dad.
And Hardin and I, we...
tolerate each other but barely.
His father's the chancellor?
Yeah.
Listen, Tessa,
he's just trying to get a reaction.
Well he's not gonna get one from me.
It actually does hurt.
You should get one.
My mom would literally kill me.
You need to get this.
I bet she'd love that one.
Yeah, dice.
I feel like my mom has everything planned out for me.
Like, I think she's been planning my wedding to Noah
since we were five.
Wait, is Noah the only dude you've ever gone out with?
That's sad.
Watch it.
Yeah, you guys really aren't selling me on this.
[Steph whispers] You look so good tonight.
[Tessa] Can I get a small coffee, please?
[server] Here you go.
Yeah, thanks.
Hi.
Hi.
I can't stay away from you.
What?
Well, we're gonna see each other.
I'm friends with Steph, and you're roommates.
Tessa, let's just start over.
Just reset and we can be-- What... friends?
Well why not?
I wanna show you something.
So show me then.
It's a...
it's a place.
I think that it's better if we...
keep our distance.
See you around.
It's down this way.
Come on.
Welcome to my favorite place.
It's beautiful.
How about a swim?
What are...
-What are you doing? -I'm swimming.
Hardin.
Hardin!
Come in.
You can wear my t-shirt.
It feels amazing.
A little privacy...
please.
[Tessa] Okay.
What?
I like it better on you.
Can I ask you something?
Do I even have a choice?
Who do you love the most in the world?
Easy.
Myself.
Of course you do.
What's your boyfriend's name?
It's Noah.
Noah.
Does he go here?
He's in high school.
High school.
What does a high school kid do to deserve you?
He is nice to me.
Nice.
Isn't that just another word for boring?
Not always.
Can I show you something?
Hold your breath.
The silence.
It's peaceful.
Do you think that's weird?
No.
Not at all.
I thought that you just wanted to be friends.
I don't think we can ever be just friends.
Have you never been touched before?
Why'd you stop?
We've got time.
So why do you call them chips?
-Why do you call them fries? -'Cause they're fried.
They're not French.
-You've got plenty there. -[laughs]
I ordered mine without ketchup. Oh, I'll be right back.
Thank you.
No ketchup?
Very un-American.
I'm full of surprises.
So what's your story then?
My story?
Yeah, like your family.
How you ended up here.
I'll pass.
I just don't think...
asking a bunch of arbitrary questions about someone's past
is gonna tell you who they are.
I can find out who you are by sitting here and spending time with you.
What?
What?
What are you doing?
I'm just waiting for you to reveal your true self to me by just sitting here and...
spending time with you.
-Here you go. -Thank you.
Okay, fair enough.
One question.
Why have all those romance novels if you don't believe in love?
Who says I don't believe in love?
You did in Soto's class.
True.
Maybe don't believe everything I say.
[Molly] Hi guys.
Hey, Tessa.
Guys, let's just hang out for a minute.
[Molly] So what have you two been up to?
-We were just-- -Just getting some food.
How's the boyfriend, Tess?
We're leaving.
Perfect, I need a ride.
It's not a good time. Ask Zed.
Dude, we just got here.
-Excuse me. -You're excused.
Alright.
-Tessa? -[keys rattle]
Really?
Yes. I won't be long.
[Tessa] I'll be at the bar.
[Zed] See you around.
[Zed] What's up, bro?
[Molly] So what's up?
What was that?
What was what?
Were you like, embarrassed that they saw us together?
No.
You know, I am gonna tell Noah about us, I--
Us?
What do you mean, us?
If you want to dump Mr. High school then go ahead
but don't do it on my account.
What?
Look, it was fun,
but I don't date.
Are you...
actually kidding me?
You're here.
What are you dreaming about?
Surprise!
Wait...
What are you...?
What are you doing here?
-[sighs] -How are you?
Thank you.
You okay?
Yeah. No, yeah, of course.
-Okay. -Thank you. Yeah.
What shall we do?
-[Zed] What's up, Tessa? -Hey.
[Zed] He does exist.
-What's up, man? I'm Zed. -Good. How you doing?
Tessa.
Thanks.
[Zed] Cops are probably gonna shut us down.
Oh. Should we get out of here?
[Molly] Hey, Tessa. Didn't expect to see you here.
[Molly] So how about we play a game of...
suck and blow.
[Jace] Suck and blow, I'm down.
Okay, I got it.
-[Jace] Pass to Noah... -[Tessa] Uh... no, no.
Whoa, dude, don't go there, alright?
[Jace] Chill. It's just a game.
Hey, dude, chill out.
-Relax. -Relax?
Hey!
-[smack] -[Zed] Hey! Chill!
[Jace] You're gonna regret this.
Dude! What are you doing, man?
[Zed and Molly] Hardin!
Hey, thanks for coming.
What happened?
well, it started about his father and then...
your name sort of came up.
He won't talk to me, so...
I figured maybe he would talk to you.
Where is he?
What are you doing here?
I was worried about you.
Shouldn't you be with your perfect boyfriend, Theresa?
Don't bring Noah into this.
I thought you didn't drink.
I don't.
I didn't.
What does it matter?
You made a mess in there.
I was celebrating.
Didn't you hear?
Dear old dad's getting married.
You should see the dump my mum lives in in London.
Don't you think you've had enough?
Don't.
I can get it.
-[chink of glass] -[Tessa gasps] Damn it.
Come with me.
I'm sorry for how I treated you.
If you don't...
date, if that's how you feel...
I don't think that is how I feel anymore.
I'm a mess.
I think that we're both a mess.
You don't ever have to cover up.
Not for me.
[Noah] Hey.
You okay?
-Yes. -Where were you? I texted you.
You didn't answer me.
I'm sorry, my... -my phone died, I'm sorry. -Where were you?
A friend needed my help.
But in the middle of the night?
Know what? I can explain. Can we...
Please, can we just go inside and talk?
I...
No.
I don't believe this.
No, Noah...
Noah, wait.
Noah, I'm... I'm confused.
I wanted to talk to you about it for a while.
I am so, so sorry.
Noah...
Tessa.
Go home, Hardin.
Noah and I just...
broke up.
I feel like I just lost my best friend.
Come over here. Come on.
I didn't expect to see you.
When my dad left...
I was ten.
He left us with nothing.
And my mom, she just...
sort of fell apart.
I had to take care of her alone.
But...
Noah was there for me, you know?
I hate myself for what I did to him.
Tessa, it's not your fault.
Yeah.
It is.
Noah is my best friend.
But you...
you're so much more.
[security] Library's closing! Library's getting ready to close.
Library is closing.
-Follow me. -Hm?
-Come on. -What are--
Down here.
"You could draw me to fire, you could draw me to water.
You could draw me to the gallows,
you could draw me to any death.
You could draw me to anything I have most avoided.
This and the confusion of my thoughts,
so that I am fit for nothing,
is what I mean by your being the ruin of me."
Why'd you stop?
We should go.
[security] Hey!
What are you doing here?
Stop!
[lecturer] But perhaps the most mesmerizing force we see
is the binary star.
Two stars find their way across vast stretches of space and time.
to find another wandering body and become attached
for eternity to each other...
...each star pushing the other
to explode in supernova...
becoming either the nucleus of planetary nebula
or just as awesome, resulting in the death star...
[Hardin] What are you doing, Tessa?
Learning about the stars?
Do you have any idea how beautiful you are right now?
What are you always writing in there?
None of your business.
Show me.
No.
-Come on. -No chance.
I just wanna see what's...
Tessa, hon, I've called all day--
-Tessa? -Mom?
What are you doing here?
What the hell is going on?
-Nothing. -Who's he?
The guy Noah told me about?
So this is how you spend your time instead of going to class.
-No! -I think I should go.
-You think? -Can we talk about this outside?
Please?
You, go. Come with me.
You have got to be kidding me.
I knew as soon as I saw that roommate that something like this would happen.
Are you serious right now?
And after all this work
and you are gonna throw it away for some boy.
What are you talking about? I'm not.
You're gonna break up with this boy
and you are gonna focus on your school work.
Do you even know what it has been like trying to be perfect for you?
Having you mold my life into the way that you wanted it to be.
I did it for your own good.
I am so so sorry, Mom,
that your life didn't work out the way you wanted it to.
I really am.
But this is my life and you have to let me live it.
Is that really what you want?
Yes.
If I leave now...
you're cut off.
He's gonna break your heart.
[Landon] She's cut you off because of Hardin.
I'm just a little worried, is all.
Why?
Hardin is...
Hardin is complicated.
Yeah, I know, but...
he's different around me.
Just be careful.
-[Hardin] You okay? -Yeah.
Where've you been?
Jump in and I'll show you.
-Are you ready? -Yes.
-Are you sure? -Yes!
Who's place is this?
Friend of my father's.
A professor.
Where are they?
She's in Italy.
All year.
I'm meant to be watering the plants.
Ooh, she paints.
It's really nice.
Imagine if it were our place.
Sure.
It can be.
What, you mean like...
live together?
When you said your mum was cutting you off I had to do something.
We can stay here for the rest of the year.
Just you and me.
You did this for me?
-Good? -Mm-hm.
[Hardin] Look at that one.
-It looks a bit like you. -[Tessa laughs]
This is crazy.
-[Hardin] I still can't believe it. -Hm?
Wait, what?
That you're mine.
Not this again.
I don't deserve you.
Nothing...
could ever change the way that I feel about you.
[Hardin] I can't believe you talked me into this.
[Tessa] It's a wedding reception, it's not a jail sentence.
Hey!
-Hey, you guys made it. -Yeah.
-You look beautiful, Tessa. -Thank you.
Hey, you clean up well, man.
This is so fancy.
Yeah, it's beautiful.
So we're brothers.
Yep.
You must be really happy for your mom and Ken.
Yeah, yeah, I am.
I'll see you two in there.
This looks so good.
Look who's here.
It's good to see you.
You too.
-And you must be... Tessa. -Tessa.
-I'm Karen. Landon's mom. -It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you. -Congratulations.
Thank you.
It means a lot to me that you could be here.
Congratulations.
Thanks for coming.
I'm happy you decided to join us, son.
Landon tells us you're in Professor Soto's seminar.
-Yeah. -So you're an English major?
Um, I... I would love to, but I think if I want to be employed
maybe business or econ.
If you're interested in the business side of literature,
my friend owns a publishing company.
-[Hardin] You mean Vance? -Yes.
-I can call Vance for her? -Of course.
He'd be happy to hear from you.
Ken.
Dana's arrived.
I think we should go say hi.
Enjoy.
-Nice meeting you. -You too.
Let's just have fun.
I can't.
Why not?
You made me promise to be on my best behavior.
Thank you all for coming.
Tonight we celebrate
a great good fortune.
And her name is Karen.
The love of my life and...
and frankly, she saved my life.
I'm suddenly blessed by a new bride,
a new life,
and not one, but two brilliant sons.
Hardin...
and Landon.
I remember an earlier time when my greatest pleasure
was to listen to Hardin who...
loved to recite passages from novels,
all by memory, and he would perform them,
leaving me with tears...
He's not the man I grew up with.
[Ken] ...or laughter.
My father was a drunk...
and nothing more.
At least he's trying.
Which is more than my father ever did.
People change.
Clearly.
This doesn't change what happened.
What happened?
One night when I was eight...
my dad was at the pub.
Drunk as usual.
He messed with the wrong guys.
They came to our house for payback.
He wasn't there.
They found my mum instead.
I tried...
I tried to fight them off but I couldn't.
[Ken in background] ...so thank you, my friends...
And that's my dad.
The beloved Chancellor Scott.
[Ken] Let's have fun.
I don't suppose you recall any of those passages.
Not the way you remember it.
I would love to have a dance with your brilliant son.
I want you now.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Do you want me to stop?
No. Just go slow.
Car.
It was cat.
Do another one.
That one is...
-I'm really good at this. -I've no idea.
Just do one more. I promise I'll get it.
I don't know.
What was it?
Maybe stay up late and we can work on that...
I'll text you.
Hey.
Hey.
How's it going? I haven't seen you since the bonfire.
Yeah, I've been busy...
I guess.
How's it going with you and your boyfriend?
Er... we're not together anymore.
Ouch.
Bye bye, high school.
Yeah. It was pretty painful.
I can tell you moved on pretty quickly.
-How's Hardin? -What do you mean?
He told me you've been hanging out.
Yeah. we have.
Cool.
Really?
Yeah, I mean Hardin does what Hardin does.
What's wrong?
What's all this about?
What didn't you tell me?
I don't know what she's talking about.
-You don't know what she's talking about? -I don't know.
-What didn't you tell me? -Nothing.
-I need to go. -What? Now?
Hardin, answer me.
-Where are you going? -Out.
What's going on?
Do you trust me?
-Of course I do. It's-- -Then what's the problem?
What are you doing in Hardin's car?
What, I can't borrow his car?
Jace, just tell me where he is.
Maybe he's at Blind Bob's.
Oh my gosh, hey!
What's the matter?
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
Want some fries? You hungry?
I haven't seen you since you moved out.
I've been living with Hardin off-campus.
[Steph] Wait.
-You two are living together. -Yeah.
Wow, Tessa.
-I didn't know you two were that serious. -Yeah, we are.
How long has this been going on? [Jace] Look who I found!
Hey, Jace, hey Hardin.
I got you.
Tessa?
Hi, Hardin.
Tessa was just telling us about latest.
Tessa's been filling us in on all the details.
Moving in together.
And you guys are so adorable.
Is there anything you wanna tell Tessa?
Yes, like what's been going on between you and her?
-Nothing's going on with me and her. -I don't believe you.
What have you said?
-Tessa, I swear-- -I saw the texts that she sent you.
They meant nothing. I didn't even reply.
-They meant nothing. -You're kidding me.
Nothing's going on.
Don't you think this thing has gone too far?
What thing, Hardin?
[Molly] Something's going on.
But not what you think.
Molly, shut up.
Tessa...
let's get out of here, I'll explain everything, I promise.
Remember truth or dare?
Molly, don't.
Molly!
[Tessa] I'm done playing this game.
[Zed] I like this girl.
[Tessa] Looks like Hardin Scott just got his first rejection.
You don't think I can make it happen.
[Molly] Make what happen?
[Hardin] Here's a dare.
Make her fall in love with me.
And then...
I'll just...
turn it off.
It was all a game.
[Hardin] Tessa.
Tessa.
Tessa, please, you have to believe me.
Tessa, that was before everything.
Before I got to know you.
[Molly] Is that true?
And all of you knew?
Tessa.
Tessa, wait.
Tessa.
So what exactly did you tell them then?
Nothing.
None of it was real.
I actually thought...
I thought that...
You're just a liar.
That was all before.
Before what?
Before-- You snapped your fingers and turned it off.
You said nothing could change the way you felt about me.
Then I guess we're both liars.
Hi, Mom.
What happened?
I don't really...
wanna talk about it.
I just...
I came here to say that...
I'm sorry.
I'm...
I'm sorry too.
I love you.
So how come you're back?
I just needed to come home.
I'm so sorry, Noah.
I never meant to hurt you.
Yeah, I know.
I guess I...
I just never saw...
any of this coming.
Yeah, but...
that's like the point.
Right?
Like, we change and we discover who we are.
I think that's okay.
Yeah?
Yeah. [laughs]
[Soto] On a parting note,
I was deeply impressed
by all of your papers attacking our themes for this semester.
Congratulations on all of your good work.
Good job.
Miss Young.
This is what Hardin turned in.
I think it was actually written more for you than it was for me.
Thank you.
What is that?
Um... a secret spot.
And a good place to think.
[Hardin] I've read hundreds of novels in my life.
Most of them claiming that love was the center of the universe...
that it could heal any damage inside of us,
that it was what we need to survive.
From Darcy to Heathcliff, I thought they were fools...
that love was something fictional,
only found in worn pages of a book.
But that has all changed
since I met my Elizabeth Bennet.
I never thought I would find myself completely and utterly consumed by another until her.
completely and utterly consumed by another until her.
She took my hand
and led me out of the darkness
and showed me that whatever our souls are made of...
hers and mine
are the same.
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.
[in English] You're back.
Yes. Finally.
Did you see the news?
No.
Oh, my God. Where is it?
[in Japanese] Yamada-san, do you have the newspaper?
[in English] Here.
BODY PART FOUND IN TOKYO BAY
They're saying it could be Lily.
He asked me to give it to you.
-Anything else? -What are you busting my ass for?
'Cause you could get me killed, Detective.
[muffled] Hey, Lucy. Lucy?
What?
I'm Detective Oguchi.
This is Detective Kameyama.
We have a few questions.
Okay?
Okay.
[in English] What is name?
-Louisa Fly. -[speaking Japanese]
[in English] It's on my alien registration card.
[in English] How old?
It's on there, too.
[in English] What is your job?
I'm a translator at Sasagawa.
[in Japanese] So you speak Japanese?
Of course.
You didn't say so.
I wasn't asked.
-Why was I not told she's a translator? -Sorry, I didn't know.
-I didn’t know she was such a smart ass. -Be careful.
I understand everything.
I want you to tell me about the night Lily Bridges disappeared.
From what we can tell, you were the last person she spoke to.
We spoke for a minute or so.
She left.
So, I went back inside.
Not according to your neighbor.
She said a few minutes later, you left your apartment without an umbrella.
I did.
So, it wasn't the last time that you saw her?
-I didn't catch up with her. -Why did you follow her?
She had something of mine. I wanted it back.
-What was it? -My coat.
So you spoke to her again?
No. I said I didn't find her.
You assumed she was going to the station?
-Is that strange? -And you never saw her again?
Answer me!
How many times do I need to answer the same question?
[Kameyama] Ms. Fly...
tell me, how long have you been in Japan?
Five years and two months.
You have family here?
No, just me.
What does your father do?
He's an electrician.
Brothers and sisters?
Seven brothers.
Six, actually.
One of them died.
-You are unmarried, of course. -Of course.
-Do you have a boyfriend? -No.
Are you sure?
Absolutely positive.
Shouldn't you ask permission?
I never ask.
Why not?
You lose the shot.
Don't people get annoyed?
I don't photograph people.
What do you take pictures of then?
Water.
Buildings.
Reflections.
That kind of thing.
But... you photographed me.
[in English] My name is Teiji.
Louisa Fly.
But everyone calls me Lucy Fly.
[Teiji] This is where I work.
[Lucy] Really?
What kind of camera is that?
Olympus OM-1.
It has a Zuiko lens, 50mm.
-Very fast. -Interesting.
Is it?
-[slurps] -Not really.
Just trying to make conversation.
Why?
Because that's what normal people do.
-But you are not normal. -Neither are you.
So let's not pretend to be.
Okay.
Let's just be honest with each other from the beginning.
All day long, I watch people talk,
saying all kinds of things without saying what they are really thinking.
Right.
So...
what are you really thinking?
Tell me everything.
Everything?
I dare you.
Okay.
Well, the noodles are too hot, and the broth is too salty.
This is the strangest date I've ever been on, if it's even a date.
I probably shouldn't trust a stranger that I've just met,
and I should probably leave.
Why don't you?
Because I'm attracted to you.
A little.
That's good.
Good.
Now, you be honest with me.
I will.
What are you thinking?
I want to photograph you.
You've already done that. What else?
That is all I'm thinking.
My secret.
This place is incredible.
Thank you.
Do you live here alone?
Yes. Not many people have been here.
Wait here.
I'll be right back.
Where do you want me to stand?
Anywhere.
What do you want me to do?
Anything.
I've never had my picture taken before.
Not properly.
Then I'm the first.
Come with me.
Thank God.
You hear that?
Only after earthquakes...
you hear it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I do. What is it?
[woman in Japanese] A friend of mine is organizing a special event for the Tanabata Festival and asked us to perform.
for the Tanabata Festival and asked us to perform.
But that only gives us two months.
Maybe if we could practice twice a week, we could do it.
Exactly.
-Let's try. -[laughs]
Lucy.
I brought you a gift for your birthday.
Really?
It's just a little something...
I've been working on.
Thank you so much.
-[in English] Happy birthday. -Happy birthday.
[in Japanese] I have many at home. I cultivate them myself.
I don't normally give them away.
It's exquisite.
I love it.
Lucy Fly! How's it going?
-Nice singing. -Yeah?
-Thanks. I do my best. -Yeah?
Come and meet the new recruit.
So, she can't seem to get her bearings here.
She feels like she's landed on the moon or something.
So, anything you can do to help her would be great.
-Mm-hm. -Okay?
Lucy, this is Lily. Lily, Lucy Fly.
-Hi there. -Hello.
Happy birthday!
-Thank you, Natsuko. -It's your birthday?
Thanks for inviting me to your birthday party.
Well, it's not really that, but you're welcome.
Uh, drinks for the birthday girl. We have champagne.
-I'll have Sapporo, please. -Oh, me too.
-Okay. -I'll give you a hand.
Here, sorry.
-You can... -Okay.
Um, so, how long have you been in Japan?
Just like three weeks now.
I mean, it's been, like, totally crazy. Like, everything is so different.
-Yeah, I guess that's why we're all here. -Oh, I hear you.
I'd had it with DC. I had to get out.
Where are you from?
Um, Sweden, originally.
But that was a long time ago. So I kind of see myself from here now.
Japanese Lucy.
Bob said you were looking for somewhere to live.
Yeah, I really need to find somewhere.
I've been so stressed out about it that I've been breaking out in hives.
But I'm working at a bar right now,
and my dad sent me money, so I can afford my own place.
But it's hard to find anywhere, especially if you don't speak the language.
Right.
I heard you speak good Japanese.
It's okay, yeah.
Oh, you're lucky, though. I wish I could.
I'm going to kill you, Bob.
What, why?
We don't have anything in common.
I don't wanna get stuck looking after her.
Oh, you won't. It's just... Look, she's new, so I--
Tokyo has tons of newcomers. If I took care of all of them,
I wouldn't have a life of my own.
All right. I'm sorry I opened my big mouth.
It's just... She's quite fit.
So what?
[chuckles] Okay. Whatever you say.
Almost there.
Then, it's not bad.
And finally, fixer.
This one is good, too.
I like this mark here.
My scar?
Yes.
So beautiful.
[Natsuko] So, how's it going with the guy you met?
Fine.
Does he have a soy sauce face or a ketchup face?
-What? -[laughs]
That's the way we talk about whether a Japanese person
looks Eastern or Western.
More soy, I suppose.
So...
how's everything?
-What do you mean? -You know?
-In the bedroom? -We haven't done anything yet.
Really?
-Taking it slow? -It's not up to me.
Perfect.
I need to change film.
What are you doing?
[in Japanese] I didn't ask you to do that.
-[Lucy in English] It's very tight. -Yes.
It's a furisode. They’re worn on happy occasions.
It's for unmarried women, right?
It's for young unmarried women.
Okay.
There, finished.
Look.
So pretty.
It’s not so easy for single women in Japan.
No, it's hard.
Have you ever thought of getting married?
No.
Because of my job. You know, I'm a magistrate.
It’s a little intimidating for most men.
And besides, I’m too old now.
You're still young.
Not in the eyes of Japanese men.
Maybe I could get a widower.
[laughs] Or an old one with medical problems.
But I don’t know how I'd find the time.
Right.
I have my job, my friends,
the string quartet.
It’s a lot to give up to wash some old man’s diapers.
-That must be Yamamoto-san. -Hm.
I’ll go and help her with the cakes.
-[in Japanese] Hello. -Hell-- [grunts]
[in English] Lucy, call an ambulance!
Yamamoto-san!
[in Japanese] Tell me.
[in English] Yamamoto-san died today.
She fell down the stairs when I greeted her.
She broke her neck.
Death follows me. It always has.
-I understand. -No, you don't.
You don't understand half of it.
You will tell me, in time.
And I will tell you things about me.
The first time we saw each other,
I knew we could be truthful.
I knew it.
Let me show you something.
My aunt, she brought me up.
After she died, I left Kagoshima and came to Tokyo.
She's beautiful.
[Teiji] We live in the atmosphere of death.
But we are alive.
[Kameyama in Japanese] Do you know someone called Teiji Matsuda?
I do, yes.
Did Lily Bridges know him?
Yes.
When did you first meet him?
May 3rd.
You seem very certain of that.
That was the date.
Was he...
your boyfriend?
-For a time. -[Oguchi laughs]
Why didn't you say that when I asked before?
He asked in the wrong tense.
[Oguchi] This is a murder investigation. You understand?
And we strongly suspect it was someone who knew her.
This is a very serious matter.
Why are you so unhelpful?
You are not like Japanese women.
Yes, I am.
[in English] I don't understand how anyone finds anything
if none of the streets have names.
I guess I'm just gonna have to learn numbers.
-[in Japanese] Good morning. -Good morning.
[in English] Thank you.
Oh, I love this one! It's so Japanese.
I think I had a dream about a place like this,
but in my dream it was a tree house.
It's perfect.
-The kitchen’s small. -I don't cook.
How did I know that?
Well, I guess the only real downside is that it's an old building,
so in case of an earthquake...
I don't care. I mean, it's lasted this long.
True.
Let's put in an application.
Okay.
Will you tell her for me?
Of course.
[Lily] Look.
[Lily] It's weird how everyone stares at you in Japan.
It's like being famous.
[Lucy] Yes. Some people get addicted to that.
Like Bob?
Like Bob.
He's kind of sexy, though, isn't he?
I don't see him that way. Nope.
Do you have a boyfriend?
I do.
What's his name?
His name is Teiji.
Teiji.
This looks good, the contract.
Um... I can ask one of the lawyers at Sasagawa to double-check it.
Thanks. I'm so impressed you can even read that.
[waitress in Japanese] I can take your order if you're ready.
[in English] Will you order me a coffee?
-[in Japanese] Just a moment, please. -Okay.
[in English] You have to be able to order for yourself.
How are you gonna survive if you can't ask for anything?
I don't know.
If you want a coffee, you say, "Koohii o hitotsu,"
which means one, "kudasai," which means please.
[in Japanese] Koohii o...
-hitotsu... -Hitotsu kudasai.
Kudasai.
[in English] That's it.
-[in Japanese] Excuse me. -Yes.
Koohii o hitotsu kudasai.
What would you like?
Koohii o hitotsu kudasai.
Okay.
-Me too. -Okay.
[in English] That's crazy that she understood that.
[in Japanese] Look.
The light, the shadow, everything exactly right.
[in English] When did you start photography?
[in Japanese] At school.
I was always in the darkroom.
There was an old teacher, Mr. Hyakutake, who taught me.
There were about a dozen people in the photography club,
but eventually, they all left, and there was only me.
[in English] I read once that when...
the Westerners arrived in 19th century Japan,
they wanted to photograph the locals, but...
they wouldn’t let them.
They thought it would steal their soul.
[in Japanese] I understand that.
The subject always gives something,
some part of themselves, to the photographer.
If every time I took a photo it took a piece of your soul...
would you still let me?
[in English] I think you know the answer to that question.
[in Japanese] I will put these away.
[in English] You gonna lock them away?
Yes.
What else do you have in there?
[Bob] Didn't Teiji wanna come today? I've gotta meet him one of these days.
-[Lucy] You will. -You two getting on well?
[Lucy] Yeah. Great.
[Bob] Tell me more.
[Lucy] Well, I guess we're both a bit odd, but we fit well together.
[Lucy] Shut up.
Oh, so the band's playing another gig next week.
At the Downbeat Club in Ikebukuro.
-That's good. -Yeah.
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
Yeah, these musicians, they are the best I've ever played with.
I used to have a couple of bands back in England,
but, you know, there's so much negativity there.
Yeah.
I think that's what I like most about Japan.
It gives you a second chance.
[Bob] Oh, my goodness. Look at that.
Wow!
-[Lucy] It's so beautiful. -[Natsuko] Stunning.
[Lucy] I love Japan.
-[Bob] Did anyone bring a camera? -[Natsuko] Not me.
-[Lucy] Not me. -[Lily] No.
-[Lucy] What about... "good morning"? -[Lily] Ohayo gozaimasu.
[Lucy] And then...
"How are you?"
[Lily] Gen-ji?
Gen-ki... desu-ka.
Uh... And then if you meet someone for the first time, you just say,
-"Yoroshiku onegaishimasu." -Oh, my God.
-Just... Ah! -Oh, shit.
-Oh! -Okay, sit down.
No, no, I'm-- -Sit down. -Ah!
-I'm gonna take your shoe off. -What?
-Does this hurt? -[grunts]
Push on my hand.
It's not broken. Probably sprained.
[Bob] What happened?
[grunts] I fell on this, and Lily's playing nurse.
I'm not playing. I used to work at George Washington Hospital.
I am a nurse.
[scoffs] Really?
Yeah, I wasn't always a bartender.
-[Bob] Why don't you come in here? -[Lily] I'm going to go in with Lucy.
Maybe later, though.
[Lily] How's your ankle?
It's better.
You think Teiji would like it here?
Yeah, I think so.
He loves the water and...
reflections. He would photograph everything.
I love taking photographs, but I'm not very good.
-Does he sell his pictures? -I don't think so.
But... I don't know.
Well, what does he do with them?
I'm not sure.
I wish I could meet him.
Why don't you and I go down to the noodle shop one night?
-I don't know. -Come on, it'll be fun.
Yeah, sure.
Teiji, I was wondering...
why don't you do something with your photographs?
I mean, not the ones of me, of course, but...
the ones of the city. They're really good.
-[Teiji] I don't want to. -Really?
I mean...
-why are you taking them? -I'm collecting them.
For what?
My collection.
You can have an exhibition.
Or put them in a book, let people see them.
Why does it matter to you so much?
I'm sorry.
[in Japanese] I've got to go to work.
[in Japanese] Will I see you this weekend?
I have to work.
-Um... Yes, but... -I will call you.
[in English] Okay.
Bye.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
They are private.
Are you spying on me?
Why did you do this?
Who is she?
Her name is Sachi.
Were you together?
Yes. I must get back to work.
Where is she now?
I don't know. She's gone.
Just "gone?"
[in Japanese] We finished. She left. I didn’t try to find her.
When I found you, I stopped thinking of Sachi.
I'm sorry. Please forget I ever did this.
-I have to get back. -Hold me.
[in English] I shouldn't have done that.
It's just that I think about you all the time, every moment.
-I wanted to know more about you. -That's not the way to find out.
I know.
You must trust me.
I will.
I just got a letter from my mom, and it took eight days to get here.
I know.
That's fast, actually.
And the phones!
I called my girlfriend and we talked for, like, 20 minutes.
And it cost over a hundred bucks.
I find it better not to call.
I like being cut off.
It's great.
Do you miss your family?
Nope.
How are the noodles?
-Awesome. -Delicious.
I'm finishing work soon.
Do you wanna go somewhere?
It's getting late. I think Lily wants to go home.
Are you kidding? I'd love to.
[Lily] Can we go?
Please?
Sure.
-[Lily] Awesome. -Yeah.
Good.
Oh, my God. He's so cute!
Cute?
He's not cute. Kittens are cute.
Okay, whatever, he's gorgeous. And he's so tall.
I thought Japanese guys were supposed to be short.
That's bullshit. That's just a stereotype.
[Lily] Hey! I was just in the area.
-Hey! -I don't wanna bother you if Teiji's here.
-He doesn't come here. -I brought whiskey.
Your house is so nice.
It's so much nicer than mine.
-No tree, though. -No, no tree.
You don't have any pictures of Teiji anywhere.
He doesn't like having his picture taken.
It was really great meeting him the other night.
He's, like, obsessed with you.
-Why do you say that? -'Cause I can tell. I know men.
What star sign are you?
I don't believe in all of that.
Why?
My personality is a combination of my genes,
my upbringing, my parents, my school. Nothing to do with the stars.
Taurus?
You came to my birthday.
Yeah, but I can also just tell.
I can read palms, too.
And tarot cards.
Really?
Sometimes, at the bar, I have to be careful when I'm getting people's change
not to look at their hands 'cause I see things.
Right.
I do, for real.
Go on, then. [clears throat]
In the past, there's like a...
emptiness or, like, a...
silence.
And then you have these three breaks in the line.
There's one early on, then another, and then a third.
What do they mean?
Abrupt change.
Accidents.
Death.
What else?
What do you see about the future?
You mean, like, Teiji?
It's really complicated. I can't read it.
Come on.
Sorry.
You clearly reacted to something.
[sighs] Well, it's like a window that opens up and then I can see things.
And then it fogs up and then I can't really be sure of anything.
-I didn't mean to freak you out. -I'm not freaked out.
-Want some whiskey? -Mm-hm.
Definitely.
-You okay? -I think so.
-I think it stopped. -Yeah, I think it did.
Do you hear that?
I'm not sure.
It's the earthquake bird.
It's what Teiji calls it.
Always sings after an earthquake.
Oh, yeah.
I hear it.
It's beautiful.
Let's go back to sleep.
I don't need tea.
Just trying to wake myself up.
I had a great night's sleep.
Except for the earthquake.
Really?
Couldn't have been a big one. I must've slept through it.
No, we were both awake.
Weird.
I don't remember.
It looks like it's going to rain. Can I borrow a coat?
Sure.
It's in there.
The closet.
I was wondering, do you want to go to Sado Island with me?
Katoh-san, my friend, she's in the string quartet.
Katoh-san, my friend, she's in the string quartet. She's from there, and she says it's like time traveling into the past.
She's from there, and she says it's like time traveling into the past.
When?
The weekend after next.
It's an arts and culture festival--
Won't you be going with Teiji?
If he can get off work, yes.
I have to think about it, because Bob invited me to some concert that he's--
Not that one.
Oh. Sorry.
No, take it.
I just need it back.
Okay.
Thank you. I'll take care of it.
-[camera shutter clicks] -Teiji...
let's not take any more photos today.
Why?
I'm tired of it.
-Okay. -No, I mean, we could take some more.
-I'm sorry. -No.
Not when you don't want to.
Did you used to go out in Shinjuku with Sachi?
Sometimes.
Why do you ask?
Natsuko, the girl I work with, she has a sister who's in a band,
and they're gonna play at this club tomorrow night.
Do you want to go?
Well, we never go out. We could.
You know, have fun.
Bob is gonna be there, and... Lily, I think.
Okay, let's go.
-[Bob] What do you think? -About what?
The band.
They're good.
What do you think?
I don't get it. They're not really my thing.
I mean, they have an image.
Apparently, they just signed a record contract.
You'll get there.
I know.
So, are you and Lily dating now?
Nope. She's a piece of work, that one.
She sends all these signals, but she doesn't follow through.
What do you mean?
All right, so... we got off together.
And fair enough, it was just once,
but then we made a plan to go to this music festival in Nagoya this weekend.
And she just called and canceled and didn't give me any reason.
Right.
When she's interested in you, you're the only one who exists.
Then she moves on to someone else, and it's like you were never even there.
[Teiji] I'm going to the bar.
-Do you want a beer? -[Bob] I'll get one, mate.
Make that two.
-[in Japanese] Did you have fun tonight? -Yeah.
What's the matter?
Well, you and Lily were having a good time out there.
Yes. She is a good dancer.
Were you jealous?
No, not at all. Why?
I wanted you to be.
You are my girlfriend, after all.
[Lucy] How many girlfriends did you have before Sachi?
Not many.
You were too busy in the school darkroom?
I was.
When did you lose your virginity?
You know...
With Sachi.
[in English] Really?
No one before then?
[in Japanese] I didn’t really like the girls in my hometown.
Really?
[in English] How about you? Your first time?
Me?
The occasion wasn't very romantic.
I was 14.
I went over to see my friend at her house, but...
she wasn't there.
She was at netball practice.
Her dad told me that he had his own
vodka distillery in the garden shed, so we went and...
tried some.
That was it.
I got nauseous after that.
A couple of weeks later.
He wasn't...
too happy, of course, when I told him.
And my friend didn't show up to school.
It turns out that he had gone off to sea in a canoe and went too far out.
The current was too strong, they said.
He washed up a few kilometers down the shore.
And I found out that the baby...
apparently wasn't real.
Do you still think about him?
Every day of my life.
Are you glad he's dead?
Sometimes.
[Ms. Katoh in Japanese] It's an old book, but has a lot about the culture of Sado.
It's a very beautiful island,
but not so many people go there anymore.
Is everything okay?
Yes.
-You seem a little-- -I'm perfectly fine.
[in English] Hey.
We should get some tickets.
I already got you one.
-Really? -Yeah.
You have a rash.
I know.
-I have some cream you can use. -No. I'm good.
Is Teiji coming?
I don't think so.
I haven't seen him since Tuesday when we went to the club.
Oh. Is something wrong?
No. He's just been very busy lately,
and I've been working on those translations for electrical--
and I've been working on those translations for electrical-- There he is.
-[in Japanese] I never thought you'd come. -Why not?
-Well, it's good to see you. -You too.
[in English] Hi, Lily.
Hi, Teiji.
[Lily] Let's go in!
It's probably very cold and full of sea urchins and...
-So what? -Come on, Lucy.
Okay.
[Teiji] So, Lily, you're a nurse in America.
-That's a career. -[Lily] Maybe.
I mean, I do miss the hospital, and the bar is really hard.
[Teiji] I think it's a good kind of work, like the noodle shop.
It gives me all the time I need for thinking.
Because my body just gets on with the job by itself.
Yeah. I'm really bad at bartending, though.
Sometimes I think the customers are gonna start jumping over the counter
and serving themselves.
At least now you're not around death every day.
Lucy.
Yeah.
I mean, that's part of the job.
-But... -But what?
Well, I'd say that there were three times that I saved somebody's life,
so I like to think about that rather than...
death.
That's my futon.
I just really like the color. You don't mind, do you?
Come sit.
Teiji can sleep here, and you can sleep here next to me.
[Teiji] This is a traditional Japanese breakfast.
I think I’d prefer some traditional Japanese cornflakes.
I heard about this, um, gold mine in Aikawa.
It could be fun to go visit.
Apparently, they have these animatronic mannequins
that kind of show how the miners used to work.
I'd kind of rather see the coast and the cliffs at Senkaku.
Well, how about we go and do both?
We'll go to the cliffs in the morning,
and then we'll go and cool off in the gold mine in the afternoon.
Okay.
I can't believe you just did that.
Delicious.
Full of nutrients.
-I'm sorry. -[Lily] What?
What happened?
I need to go back.
Hold on, sit down. Sit down. Sit down.
You're running a temperature. I'm going to lay you down, okay?
-No. -Hey, you're okay.
I'm going to lay you down.
-I feel horrible. -I know.
Just try and lay down. It's okay.
Put your head down.
It's going to be okay.
[Lily] Lucy!
There you are.
You left me on a fucking cliff top.
-Your shirt. -Thank you.
-Did you get our note? -Note?
Yeah. We left you a note under a rock, by the shirt, saying we were coming here,
and if you didn't come here, we'd come back for you.
No, I didn't see a note just lying around.
-Oh. Well, it must've blown away. -[Lucy scoffs] Right.
Yeah, maybe. Maybe we're all just gonna blow away off the edge of the world.
Are you still feeling sick?
You might have a virus, or it could be that fish eye you had for breakfast.
I've got pills at the hotel. Why don't we go back?
-I don't need your pills. -I'm just trying to help.
Yeah, I'm sure.
-Lucy, you're not making any sense. -I know what I'm feeling.
And what I'm feeling isn't right. It's not right at all.
[Teiji] Lucy.
-[in Japanese] We are sorry. -"We?"
What are you talking about?
-[gasps] -[in English] Come with me.
It's like nature is taking it back.
Yes.
A place of healing.
I hope so.
I really like you.
My Lucy.
Bye.
-Bye. -Bye.
Bye, Lily.
[in Japanese] I did it.
I killed Lily Bridges.
How did you kill her?
Tell me! How did you kill her?
I smashed her head in.
With what?
A brick.
It is good you are talking now.
Tell me why you did it.
It's best to give us as much information as possible.
Best for you, I'm sure.
All you need to know is
I am guilty.
[in Japanese] Hi, this is Lucy Fly.
I'm not in right now. Please leave a message.
[Lily in English] Lucy, are you there?
Please pick up.
I need to talk to you.
Please call me.
Lucy, what's going on?
-Are you sick? -I'm not feeling very well.
I'll be fine in a day or two.
I brought these.
Is there something you need to talk about?
No.
Well, what should I tell them at work?
You can tell them anything. I'm quitting.
Quitting?
Lucy, what are you talking about?
Leave me, Natsuko.
I'm worried about you. Just leave me, Natsuko!
Can I come in?
I know I fucked up and I'm sorry.
Do you love him?
I don't know. Kind of. It's kind of driving me crazy, you know?
I invited you to Sado Island.
I was the one who introduced you in the first place.
I know you're angry, and this isn't an excuse,
but maybe there's a bigger reason for all of this that...
-that we don't understand. -Well, did you see it in my palm?
Did you dream it was meant to be?
He was the only person who ever really saw who I was!
I'm sorry, Lucy. Okay?
I'm sorry! But can I please come in?
I feel like something really bad is gonna happen.
It already has.
[guard] Louisa Fly.
[in Japanese] Come with me, please.
[Kameyama] The DNA test came back.
Looks like the girl in the bay was not your friend after all.
Who was it?
[Kameyama] We don't know.
But...
we do know it wasn't Lily Bridges.
That puts your statement in serious doubt.
Did you murder Lily Bridges?
No.
Then why did you say you did?
Because I wanted to kill her.
[Oguchi] You do realize the crime you confessed to
would be punishable by death?
We have been unable to locate Mr. Matsuda.
Do you know where he is?
Do you think there’s a possibility that Lily and Matsuda may have
run off somewhere together?
Yes.
I thought so.
At this point, we are reclassifying this as a missing persons case.
I think I may have preferred it when she was dead.
Well...
we all live in our own reality.
Maybe, in some way,
you thought you did kill Lily Bridges.
But I never felt so.
You have guilt, but it is from a deeper source.
Why did you come to Japan?
Why do you ask?
Tell me.
There was this tree.
I used to climb it.
All the way up.
Sometimes...
I would take a book and read.
One day...
my brothers showed up. They had been on a fishing trip with the Boy Scouts.
I was eight.
They surrounded the tree
and started throwing pine cones and stones...
at me.
I told them to stop.
There was this sharp heavy stone on the ground.
I saw my brother...
Marcus, he had his hands on it.
I met his eyes.
And his arm came up.
Then I just...
jumped...
right onto him.
Marcus fell back.
His head was pierced... by a long rusty nail sticking out from a plank of wood.
He tried to get up with the plank still attached to him.
And...
again, his eyes stared back at me.
He died in the hospital.
The nurse said to me, "It's not your fault."
I didn't know what she meant.
So I just said...
"Okay.
Yeah."
From that moment,
I didn't speak for three years.
It's easy to ignore people when they are silent.
So that's what my family did.
My parents were heartbroken.
I knew what they were thinking about me.
So I...
planned my escape.
[Kameyama] How? At the age of 11, I started learning Japanese.
At the age of 11, I started learning Japanese.
That's a very sad story.
Yes.
But it has nothing to do with this case.
Can I go now?
Sign this retraction.
[in Japanese] Is Detective Kameyama here?
I'm sorry. He's not in right now.
Do you want to leave a message?
No.
It's okay.
He will be here tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
[in English] Teiji.
Hello, Lucy.
I've been waiting for you for two days.
I knew I had to come here, that you would understand.
I was at the police station.
What did you tell them?
About you.
Nothing.
Then...
there's hope.
That's a funny word.
"Hope."
We can go away from here, to the north.
Hokkaido. Or the south, to Kyushu.
My hometown, Kagoshima.
I've always wanted to go.
Then we leave tomorrow.
Why?
Come with me.
Please.
You must.
It's over.
[Ms. Katoh in English] Can I come in?
Please.
I just made some onigiri. Would you like some?
I'm good. Thank you.
-Are you sure? -Yes.
[sighs] I'm worried about you.
I'm sorry.
It was my mistake to move in here.
Don't say that. You've been so kind.
Don't mourn him.
She came to my...
door that night, Lily.
She asked me if she could come in.
-I didn't let her. -No.
It wasn't your fault. It was.
Believe me. It was.
Perhaps.
But...
perhaps in a way...
she saved your life.
There were others, too. My brother...
my friend's father, Yamamoto-san.
Yamamoto-san?
I can hardly walk up the stairs without seeing her face.
May I tell you something?
I had waxed the steps two days before.
I only do it once every two years.
I was worried they were a little slippery.
I talked to Yamamoto-san earlier that day.
I nearly warned her.
But... I only remembered once I'd hung up.
She always wore...
very soft tabi socks.
Hi, is everybody up now?
Yes, since eight o'clock in the morning, Grandma's been putting on makeup.
Really?
Really, she took off her blush last night...
and her eyebrows.
And then Laura painted her eyebrows, Aunt.
She threw her...
pillow on her face and said, "Hey, are you messing with my eyebrows?"
She'll be unrecognizable to me.
She'll go all dressed up, with all her makeup,
like Emilia...
Virgilio's wife.
Tell Brighton Aunt Mine wants to see him.
That's why I brought him.
He didn't want to come because his shoes would get dirty.
See you in a little while.
Yeah.
Bye.
It's been six years already.
-Yes. -It's a long time.
We'll be there. I've told everyone.
Yesterday I called Nachita and said,
"Don't forget we have to get there early, we're among the first ones."
That's great.
Aren't your kids coming?
Yes, I told the guys here too.
Text me or call me if anything comes up.
Yes, God willing.
Okay then, Camila.
All right, then, take care.
I want to see you so bad, I even miss you.
So you miss me then?
This time I'm feeling really low, really sad.
I feel the same way back here.
I can't wait to see you either,
to be together, all of us.
Oh, God...
Well, yes, I'm really excited...
Really, really excited.
And as soon as they let us...
I don't want you to waste time there...
-What do they call it? -What?
Daydreaming or something.
Okay.
I want you to use those minutes holding me,
-every minute we'll be together. -Yes.
And don't let me go, don't. I want...
I want that feeling of you holding me to stay with me,
of me, feeling your body...
Who knows when I'll see you again?
God, I know.
-Stay safe, see you this Saturday. -Okay then.
-Take care. -See you.
You take care too. Tell the kids I said hi...
that I love them very much.
Mom, how are you?
Great, Iván, and you?
I'm so happy, so thrilled...
and I really need to hold you all,
I really need to be there.
If only for just a minute or two, it's okay.
God willing, I'll be there with you, and well...
As I told you in the message I sent you,
if this was my last goodbye...
from me to you, I want you to know you are...
very important to me. You're the best mom ever.
And my wife...
I thank God He gave me the opportunity to meet her, so...
I'm really happy. I want to hold you tomorrow
and tell you all I love you so much.
I don't know if I'll be able to break away from you.
I know, it'll be really hard, really sad.
Just focus on being all right, take care of yourself and...
I don't know what else to tell you, I...
All I ask is you take good care of yourself and...
tomorrow, when you see your family, hug them, kiss them.
And cheer up, we'll see what happens.
Thanks, Mom. I love you very much.
Take good care. God bless you and thanks for being my mom.
I love you very much too. Take care, my Iván.
Take care, I mean it.
That's it, there you go, keep it up.
Go on, catch it.
Yes, back there, where the T-shirts are...
#HUGS NOT WALLS
MAY 12, 2018
The red scarf.
No, to the right, the right.
Look, back there!
-Back there, all excited! -Here!
Look at them all!
Okay then, they'll soon let us through.
Families one through 15, please gather round here.
We need those first 15 families, the first who'll interact, down there.

Can't you see him?
Wave at Daddy.
Say hi to Daddy.
Dad, there's Daddy.
There's Daddy.
Look, there he is!
Can't you see him?
There's Daddy.
Thanks, we're starting the Hugs Not Walls event.
Are families ready in their positions?
What does it feel like seeing your husband's there?
I think I feel sad because...
just to think I'm leaving him behind.
Security, ready.
Families, ready.
And we'll begin the Hugs Not Walls event.
Families are ready.
Time.
Time.
Time's up.
Come back, please.
Time.
It's time.
That's all, people, time's up.
Time's up, people, it's time.
Time, family, it's time. Time's up, family, please.
Thank you, family.
All volunteers, thank you.
Those of you with radios, please give them to Teresa, back here in Juárez.
-[camera shutter clicks] -First, I wanted to know who.
Who chose money over life?
Steel and lead over blood and spirit?

the living?
Who let distance and basic difference

Who the profiteer?

I did not see it then. -[woman screams] -[panicked chatter]
This should have alerted us.
Should have been processed.
There were hints all along,
clues we should have registered, processed,
sifted for their application to the general condition.
But we were moving fast.
We were traveling light.
We were younger.
I was younger.
[Shultz] Well, I'd hate to speak about that, but of course, uh,
[Shultz] Well, I'd hate to speak about that, but of course, uh, we'll look into it. Um...
we'll look into it. Um...
But the actions that we have been forced to take in that area,
obviously, have been justified.
Japanese government vis-à-vis trade is complicated, but the simple answer is,
we're hoping that with the shift from a distinctly liberal apparatus
to a conservative one,
Japan will shift away from its nationalistic tendencies...
-Hi. -...to a system more in tune
with free trade to North America.
Not just us,
but Canada included.
-What did I miss? -[man] One more question.
So far, nothing.
Why am I not surprised?
[whispers] Apparently, spring is a great time to talk to Japan face-to-face.
-[whispers] Oh. -Cherry blossoms, temples at Mount Fuji.
I believe it's called international diplomacy.
...my sense is that that is the direction we're headed.
[man] I believe we have time for one more question.
Okay, The Atlantic Post.
Yes, thank you. Elena McMahon. Uh...
Mr. Secretary, with regards to the Pacific Rim,
where, as you put it, "We've lost so much ground,"
how might you address reports
the CIA is laying underwater mines in Nicaraguan ports?
Does Washington have any control over mining operations in Nicaragua?
[Shultz] I don't have any comment to make.
No? Care to comment on what the purpose of the harbor mining is?
Doesn't turning a blind eye to the blocking of major shipping channels seem counterintuitive
to the blocking of major shipping channels seem counterintuitive for an administration interested in improving trade?
You'd have to ask the Contras about that.
Uh, sir, with all due respect,
the President has said on television, and I quote,
"I, too, am a Contra."
-Look, uh... -[camera shutters clicking]
It looks like their purpose may indeed be
to somehow interrupt the commerce of the country.
And is this at the bequest of Washington?
Again, there's no answer I can provide there.
Ladies and gentlemen, we need to be mindful of our time.
So, Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for being here today.
Thank you so much for your time spent during lunch.
Uh, from the Press Club, we'd like to thank everybody for your questions.
Shultzy and the rope-a-dope.
Saved by the bell, I think.
[man] Our special guest will be United Nations Secretary General
[man] Our special guest will be United Nations Secretary General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar.
Thank you very much for attending.
[Shultz] Not with a ten-foot pole, Treat. The hell I will.
Understood, George, but we need a narrative. A story?
Treat, you and I both know what's going on down there.
It's just another manipulation they expect me to wrestle with on their behalf.
Nicaragua is a cancer in our own land mass,
and it's gotta be cut out, plain and simple.
The tide will ebb away from us.
Meanwhile, if a little intel leaks here and there, as long as it helps push the notion that we're a stabilizing factor
as long as it helps push the notion that we're a stabilizing factor in the zone, it's a positive.
Important thing is to control it, keep it headed in that direction.
This whole goddamn operation's gonna blow up in somebody's face,
and I will not let it be mine, not by a long shot.
You boys figure it.
[Reagan] Don't think your vote isn't needed.
Go and vote!
And take others with you...
-[Elena] Hi, kiddo. -[Cat] Hi.
How was the funeral?
Well, it wasn't exactly a funeral.
I just went to Grandpa Ward's house
and he showed me a tiny urn with some of Grandma's ashes in it.
[Cat] Were you sad?
I was. I was something like sad.
Why not sad? Why just something like it?
[Elena] Well, I thought a lot about you.
And that helped keep me thankful.
-[Cat] Really? -[Elena] Mm-hmm.
Like, how?
Like how you look so much like your grandmother.
Your smile, your eyes.
And that helped keep me happy.
Wish I could have gone.
You do?
[Cat] Yeah.
What are you doing right now?
I really want some lechón from Versailles.
Oh, baby, me too. Me too.
But I'll tell you what.
I'll get you real lechón from Havana just as soon as there's a bureau spot for me.
-[newsroom chatter] -Okay. I should.
-McMahon. -I'm gonna have it filed in an hour.
-McMahon. -I'm gonna have it filed in an hour. [Stewart] McMahon, here, now. Come here, come here. In, in, in, in.
[Stewart] McMahon, here, now. Come here, come here. In, in, in, in.
Uh, listen. Close the door. Sit down.
Okay, um, how did everything go with your mom? You doing okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine, thanks. What's up? -Good.
That move to reopen Central American bureau, it's just not happening.
Says who?
-Please. No, don't-- -Stewart, what the hell?
I've been trying to convince you, Grant, everybody,
since we left San Salvador two years ago.
We ID'd those bullet casings to Missouri, we have tracked airstrips, munitions.
Just this morning I was in touch with my Hill source who--
-Who hasn't stepped forward. -Who's about to step forward.
-Oh, come on. -He's legit. He's reliable.
I just confronted Shultz over the mined harbors and he nearly shit his pants.
If am doing this stuff from here, imagine what I could do on the ground there.
-I gotta move you to the campaign trail. -[Elena] No!
No, there's an entire room. -What about Joanne? -[Stewart] Sprained ankle.
-What about Joanne? -[Stewart] Sprained ankle.
-What about Chris? -[Stewart] He's filling in for Joanne.
Well, I don't care. Put a stringer on it.
You can't wipe me from this, Stewart.
I gotta freeze the whole desk, not just you.
Freeze the desk?
Look, our reporting on Central America
is being pointed out as too soft, sympathetic.
Says who?
Off the record, Grant was here this morning.
People on the Hill are pressing.
Of course they are, Stewart. They're being exposed.
That's the whole point, right?
Be that as it may, they're the ones who can break the bottom line here.
You know how it goes. Grant moves with business people,
politicians, lobbyists. He's not gonna cut those ties for your reporting.
Sometimes... it's just business.
It's not just business, it's real people's lives down there.
You can't just look away.
It's been ringing ever since I got back.
-I take it you talked to Stewart? -[Elena] I'm done.
You quit, right?
Tell me you walked.
I'm taking a vacation.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Alma, he froze the desk, for fuck's sake.
Do you know how many months I've accrued over the past three years?
It's appalling.
-Come on. -[telephone rings]
You seriously think that I'm gonna stop working?
All of this keeps moving. We keep moving.
The only difference is, is that we won't have to file for a couple of months.
Think about it.
The campaign trail drops you that much closer to the center.
On and off the plane, in and out of certain rooms.
McMahon.
-Hello. -[heavy breathing through phone]
[Dick] Pardon my using your time, but I've been trying to call your mother,
and that asshole she lives with refuses to put her on the line.
That's because he can't, Dad. Remember?
[Dick] I'm passing through. Maybe you could meet me in the next half hour.
-I am at work. -[typewriter keys clacking]
[Dick] Some kind of coincidence, since that's where I called you.
Look, Dad, I'm on a deadline here.
[Dick] I can do 5:30.
Meet me at the Madison.
No, Dad, I--
[man 1] Policy-wise, it's a disaster.
[man 2] It's not "policy,"
-it's politesse. -Keep on shoveling it.
-Spit it out, buddy, what's your problem? -[Elena] Dad.
We have no problem.
[Elena] Dad.
Faggots.
Actually, you're wrong.
I can see...
you're buying into the whole package here.
You're very adaptable, I ever tell you that?
Just like your mother.
Oh, come on, Ellie.
Celebrate with me.
This is your celebratory mode?
[chuckles] Come on, I... I got a big deal coming. The big deal.
If this goes off, finally I'll be able to leave you something.
[snaps fingers] Hey, buddy. What do you want?
-Oh, vodka tonic, please. -[scoffs]
Say "Absolut."
In these sissy bars, you say "vodka,"
and they'll give you a Schmerk-off or whatever it's called and charge extra.
Early Times and water for me. And... [sighs] break out the almonds, pal.
[sighs] break out the almonds, pal.
Leave the cereal for the queers.
So, you do this every day?
Same lying sacks of suit-and-tie shits
blowing hot air up each other's assholes, and you got to sit there and take notes.
Don't know how you manage, Ellie.
Well, that must have been something you lost out on observing once you left.
-That's not fair. -[Elena] No.
Let me fill you in.
How do I manage? Let's see.
Um... well, first I managed to graduate high school after you walked out on Mom, uh, 20 years ago.
after you walked out on Mom, uh, 20 years ago.
Then I managed to stay at UNLV as long as I could afford it,
seeing as how my long-lost father wouldn't tell me what to list as his profession
on the financial aid application.
What was it you told me when I finally tracked you down?
"Import-export"?
No, no, no. "Supply chain."
Let's see, what else, uh... Oh, oh! I managed to have a kid of my own,
and I still know her, too, so that's an achievement.
Breast cancer.
Managed to get through that.
So, uh, anything else...
Oh, yeah. Career,
divorce, cross-country relocation.
[stammering] All in all, I'd say I've managed pretty well.
So, the fucking Phi Pho Epsilons over at table 22
don't really bleep on my radar at this point.
I got other shit I'm managing. Thanks, Dick.
[Dick] About time, sweetheart.
Here's to your success.
-My Ellie. -[glasses clink]
[gulps] And cheers to big moves.
In fact, you just missed my partner. You know him, Epperson.
I don't know him. Yeah, you do. You remember.
Maxie. Anyway, I'm moving product at triple my rate.
-Dare I ask what the product is? -Same as it ever was.
You haven't changed, have you?
Anyhow, how's my little Cathy-bird?
She's fine. She's good, Dad.
You still got that poor little thing locked away up north?
It's a boarding school with horse stables and a Greek amphitheater.
Don't be extreme.
Anyway, with my schedule, boarding school's the most consistent option.
Have you heard from your mother?
You know, I keep calling the house,
and that drug-dealer boyfriend of hers doesn't let me talk to her. Asshole.
I say, "Let me talk to Kitty already." "You can't," he says.
I go, "Put her on the goddamn line, prick."
-And you know what that bum does? -Dad. He hangs up on me.
-Dad. -Believe it? He hangs right up. What?
You don't remember I called you last month to say I was going to California?
No, What? To visit your trust-fund husband?
Ex-husband, and...
no.
You don't remember I-I called to tell you I was going to the funeral?
We talked about it.
Someone died?
Who died?
When I first saw her, I...
I'll never forget it. [chuckles]
She-- Like a ray of light.
The Floridita in Havana, 1952.
Goddamn, we had a good time there.
My Catherine. Pretty Kitty.
Kit-Cat.
Mom used to always talk about how you guys would get the garlic shrimp with black beans every day.
[chuckling] That's right. Uh...
Before the revolution, when Havana was a real town.
[sighs] Goddamn.
Kitty's gone.
Things are hotting up again.
Whole lot of poppin' going on. [chuckles]
Oh, come on, Ellie.
Give us a smile.
Come on.
Another. Another round.
[softly] I'm good.
[man] Like, an affirmative action hire?
[woman] No, I was the top of my class.
Hey. Hey, you can sit here.
[man] I'm all about that. Hey, Pete, get the tunes going!
Yeah!
[woman] A little mealy. From yesterday.
-[man 2] Oh! Jensen, you pig. -Yeah, that was me. That was me!
-[cheering] -[man] Yeah! ♪ Sits around all day Drinks coffee and tea ♪
[crowd chanting] Four more years!
Four more years! Four more years!
Four more years!
[Reagan] That's what I came here to talk to you about.
[man] We love you, Ronnie!
[Reagan] Abe Lincoln said that we must disenthrall ourselves with the past,
and then we will save our country.
Four years ago, that's what we did.
We made a great turn.
[Reagan] Thank you. Thank you, all.
[Reagan] With regard to the future, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Thank you. Thank you.
[man] Does everyone have a glass?
Happy birthday, Helena.
But you all should know that this brave and regal lady
is distinguished by a history of service
to her community and her country.
It comes as no surprise that she would share her own birthday to be with us
for a fundraiser for Team Reagan.
So, Helena, here's to many years of selfless service,
and here's to four more years of Reagan country!
[Helena] George. Oh, George, this... [chuckles]
This is the young lady that I wanted you to meet.
Her name's just like mine.
-Elena. -Helena.
Helena.
She works for-- Yes, I know who she works for.
Oh, so you've already met. Well, good.
Sweetheart, now's not the time, really.
She's writing a piece about my favorite charity
and all the hard work that they've done.
A human-interest companion piece to our campaign coverage.
Sugar dove--
All she wants is a little background.
She wants to sit down with you and spend a little time.
And I told her that you'd be glad to.
-So, finish your cake. -[Elena chuckles]
[softly] Thank you.
Speaking of charity, just a quick question on the charitable aid--
No comment. Thank you. Goodbye.
-[Elena] Any, uh-- -No comment.
-Question about the charitable aid... -Thank you.Goodbye.
-Just a comment? -Hi. Excuse me.
Sorry, the Secretary is indisposed for questions at the moment.
So, you'll need to schedule a formal meeting
through his office to speak with him.
Happy birthday to your wife.
-Thank you. -[Treat] It's remarkable, really.
She slipped in and out of El Mozote
with the help of half the Farabundo Martí Liberation Front.
She's been burning the candle on both ends ever since.
Everything that happens down here, she's sourced-up and in print.
Massacres, assassinations, rigged elections,
the whole supply run from top to bottom.
Unafraid and over-driven, to put it mildly.
Always a step ahead by a nose.
Just the simple fact that she's down there reporting on the conflict
is evidence of the kind of instability we need as a pretext
to justify our military presence.
Look, Treat, if you think this McMahon inadvertently helps accomplish
a continual motive for our intervention, then, by all means...
[Berquist] Mr. Secretary, if I may disagree.
Well, first, the Senator sends his apologies for not being here himself.
But he, and I, can assure you, as his chief foreign aid officer,
I hold you in the most capable hands.
That said,
I think it's best if we keep all external players off the grid at this point.
Obviously, we don't want to compromise decision-making on our part
by having to address press.
I think you can see why we've pinned her as a conduit.
She's the bullhorn you don't have to hold.
Mr. Secretary, if there was some way that we could circle back--
Look, Berquist, please assure the Senator that we're working very hard
to make sure that our allies in Antigua
and the entire Antillean chain are clear of any misgivings.
The Basin Initiative is very important, and it's one that we'll be handling with, uh, experienced hands.
Fine. That's all.
Give the Senator my regards. [Berquist] Mr. Secretary, uh...
Hey, you're coming down for drinks, right?
Mike's paying.
All right, attagirl.
♪ Hey, do you want to party? ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, this is rocking Randall Hank ♪
Gus, thanks for meeting me on such short notice.
Beautiful day for some flag-waving. It is, it is.
Any day's good for that.
Who doesn't love cheerleaders and Hank Williams?
Junior.
-Sorry? -Hank Williams, Jr.
-Oh. -Different animal entirely.
Wouldn't compare a rock to the mountain it slid off of, would you?
-Well, when you put it like that... -No, ma'am. Not on your life.
Not every bull can be a longhorn, am I right?
Anyway, what you got for me today?
Well, since you were so helpful in ID'ing those casings--
1982.
El Salvador.
The casings from Lake City, Missouri.
LC80s. NATO standard, am I right?
That's right.
-What you got for me? -It's these.
[Sharp] Mm-hmm. Munitions shipping crates. This is army surplus.
Forty-five-millimeter rounds here.
These here are boxes of tracers.
That's for M16s, most likely.
Who's the old man?
Don't know.
Where'd you find this stuff? National Guard?
I got the pictures cold. Why the National Guard?
Well, because right now, Texas, Alabama, Louisiana,
20th Special Forces just declared surplus. That's the stuff you're looking at.
Equipment, rounds, all subsidized at cost.
None of it's staying put, though.
Gets shipped in and armories sell half of it right back out.
Buddy of mine tells me his shipped to Florida.
Miami, Fort Lauderdale.
That School of the Americas camp I was telling you about.
If the stuff's not staying in Florida, where's it going?
Bet my Purple Heart it's going to the same places you've been looking.
Honduras,
Costa Rica.
Close as they can get it to Nicaragua.
Contra supporters from here, you mean?
Contra, Sandinista...
I don't even know the goddamn difference. Most of the time it don't matter.
-Who's steering the stuff? -[Sharp] "Steering"?
-Who's steering the stuff? -[Sharp] "Steering"? You let a monkey drive your car, you call it steering?
Hell no.
You want to see how a monkey drives, buckle up.
Follow the bananas.
[Stewart] Why are you always dead last with the campaign polls?
New York Times, Chicago Tribune,
Philadelphia Inquirer...
Shit, probably The Connecticut Lions High School Newsletter, go blue,
has reported on the California polls before we have.
The Denver Post is selling out their late edition
with a piece on Zsa Zsa Gábor's Bel Air fundraiser.
You're less than two miles from it.
Zsa Zsa Gábor hosting a fundraiser in Bel Air isn't news, Stewart.
But you know what is? Surplus arms for Contras.
It's very promising in a campaign year, am I right?
Government-sponsored violence to neutralize Nicaraguan officials?
It's very American, it's very presidential, it's very newsworthy.
[Stewart] I want my polls, Elena. That's your job.
Bar charts, pie charts, lines and numbers.
I shouldn't have to read about the polling numbers in Orange County
from the Michigan Gazette.
Who cares about the polling numbers out of Orange County?
-I want my polls. -You're serious?
-Oh, my God, you're serious. -[phone ringing]
The incumbent cowboy is already neck deep in four years of imperial deceit,
but you're right, the polls don't reflect that.
-Nor do they reflect... -McMahon. Live line.
-...I was not on the press manifest... -McMahon. so I barely made the fucking plane here.
I don't pay you to editorialize. You know why? I'm the editor.
Report your numbers like a good reporter. -Look-- -Drop the tropical angle. Got it?
You just make sure that I'm on the fucking manifest,
and I'll file your useless fucking poll numbers on time. -[slams receiver] -[phone ringing]
McMahon.
When was this?
Is he stable?
No.
I can't. I'll arrange someone.
[Alma] Please tell me you did not just walk off a presidential campaign.
[Elena] What else could I do?
[stammering] He's got no one but me. He never remarried, he's got no other kids.
No one, just me.
All of a sudden, I was on the plane.
I didn't know I was coming here till I was here.So...
Do what you got to do. Tell Stewart...
I don't care. Tell Stewart whatever.
I'm in Miami until... until I don't know.
[Alma] No, I'll file for you. You take the weekend.
Get your head together.
[Elena] Come on, Alma,
I could file that type of rundown in my sleep till November, you know that.
Right now, I just...
I can't.
Consider me off indefinitely.
You don't sound too good.
I'm gonna come down there.
[Elena] Don't. If he wasn't out cold, I wouldn't even be calling you.
[chuckling] I haven't eaten in 28 hours.
Alma, I just, I...
[PA] Code vi, code violet. Room 308.
[Dick] Goddamn it!
[PA] Code violet. Room 308. [Dick] Get me out of here!
[woman] Sir.
-[Dick] Goddamn Epperson. -Mr. McMahon.
-Where are my shoes, for Christ's sakes? -Dad.
-It's okay. Dad, Dad. -Get me outta here, I gotta go!
-No, it's okay. -I gotta go, Kitty, I gotta go.
-Just hang on. Dad. -Goddamn Epperson.
The bastard. He quoted me three per on the 69s.
-[nurse] You're going to feel better. -Now he tells me
-the market dropped to two. -Easy.
That's not the deal. -He'll queer the whole thing up. -Dad.
-I needed this. Kitty. -[Elena] It's gonna be fine.
[Dick] Kitty.
[sighs] Dad, it's...
It's Elena.
-Ellie. [pants] -[Elena] Yeah. It's Ellie.
[Dick] Somebody's waiting for me.
-I got somebody to see. -Listen to me. Listen to me.
You're not thinking clearly.
You're not in any condition to do anything.
You're gonna make a mistake, you're gonna get hurt.
You have to do it.
Do what? I told you. I told you the whole deal.
I told you. I told you the whole deal.
Meet Kitty. Kitty Rex.
You mean your boat?
Goddamn, Ellie.
-Goddamn. -[softly] Hey.
What's gonna happen now?
I'll take care of it.
He ain't here.
You the daughter?
[Dick] The bastard quoted me three per on the 69s.
Now he tells me that the market dropped to two.
I got a big deal coming. The big deal.
-[Elena] Dare I ask what the product is? -[Dick] Same as it ever was.
[man] Take your time, Mr. McMahon. I won't rush you.
Can you tell me the name of the current US president?
I get the game. I get it. I'm supposed to say "Herbert Hoover,"
and the guy puts me away in some home. [chuckling] I get it. All right.
Wheel of Fortune.
Herbert Hoover. [sighs]
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman,
Dwight David Eisenhower, John Fitzgerald Kennedy,
Lyndon Baines Johnson, Richard Milhous Nixon,
Gerald whatever his name was, kept tripping over his feet,
Jimmy something, the Christer,
and the one now,
the one the old dummy's not meant to remember.
The other old dummy, Reagan.
[man] Excellent, Mr. McMahon. You deserve first prize.
[Dick] First prize is that you leave.
[man] I'll go get the paperwork.
Dad, what the hell?
I put this thing together on credit, Ellie.
Five, ten years ago, I wouldn't have gone out on a limb this way.
Do it clean. That's my strict motto. Cash and carry, but this is the one.
I called in all my favors.
I got paper spread from here to Chicago,
just this one last time.
One million in Citibank traveler's checks, good as gold.
I know how it sounds, but it's real.
I know what I'm saying, Ellie. It's me. I'm here.
I need you to look up a name for me. Max Epperson.
[Alma] That's E-P-P--
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Based out of Tampa,
-but look for anything in south Florida. -He's American?
I don't even know if he's real.
[Dick] Million-dollar pay date.
'Course, I have to turn half of it back to the goons that advanced me, but...
That complicates my situation, Ellie,
but you see the situation I'm in.
Do it, or not.
I'm already in the bag for 500k.
[softly] Jesus.
I might send you some photos.
[Alma] Elena?
It's all set up.
Elena, hello?
My dad is into some shit.
[Dick] Please, just go.
Talk to my guy.
I'm meeting some friend of his tomorrow. [stammering] I...
[Alma] You got a name?
No, but if I don't call you by, say, one, then, you know--
[Alma] If I don't hear from you by one o'clock,
I'm gonna steal your identity,
write the shit out of this piece,
and thank your posthumous ass in my Pulitzer speech.
I love you.
[Alma] I know you do.
Now buck up, bucko. Can't be worse than Salvador.
No place in this sweet, hot town you can't change a thousand dollar bill.
[Sedlow] Looks like you're waiting for somebody.
I think you.
First things first, how's Dick?
Must be pretty bad to be sidelining a deal like this.
You know, he's doing much better. I'll tell him you asked.
No, don't do that. Don't mention it.
Look, before I forget,
if you need anything at all, you call me first.
Okay? This is my card.
It's a pager.
What could I possibly need?
You could need a lot of things, but let's not worry about that.
Let's worry about getting things right.
What does that look like?
That looks like you taking a cab to the airport.
Okay? Don't drive yourself, you take a cab.
Be at the Pan Am Clipper Club at noon sharp.You understand?
Don't be early. Don't be late. You be on time.
What you're gonna wanna do then is go to the desk,
ask for Michelle.
Michelle is the blonde, not the spic.
The other one is Delia, she don't know me.
And then, you gonna wanna say...
I'm here to see Gary Barnett.
Of course, welcome.
Gary wants you to make yourself comfortable.
If I could please see your Clipper Club card?
-[Michelle] I saw her card. -Just sign in here, please.
Allow me, ma'am. Right this way.
-[Elena] So who exactly is Gary Barnett? -[Sedlow] Don't worry, he'll know you.
Other than that, blend in. Don't let yourself be noticed.
[woman] Can I get you anything else?
[man] All right, then. You're telling me that we do have it.
Okay. Well, then. [woman] Here you go, sir.
I came all the way up from San Salvador to close the deal.
Yeah, because we are losing our credibility with the client, you know?
Ninety-two million dollars is not chickenshit, Mr. Lee.
Just-- No, no.
Mr. Lee?
[Delia] Excuse me, miss.
You're not authorized to be here.
-Uh, Michelle said that-- -This club is members only.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
This way, please.
[Sedlow] So you let yourself be noticed.
[Elena] Noticed by who?
Noticed by somebody you shouldn't have.
Ellie, who's that?
You know what I think? You're jerking me around.
Yeah, show up here, show up there, speak to so-and-so, sit here.
It's all been pseudo cloak-and-dagger bullshit,
-and I am not amused. -[Dick] Ellie?
Can you get the rent-a-sitter to fix me another bourbon?
So what? So what?
You're selling a few third-rate military leftovers
to second-rate revolutionaries at I'm guessing first-rate markups?
So fucking what?
That story's already been written a couple of times.
Miami Herald, pick any section. I'll give you a dime to print...
It's just a microfiche, but the real headline is,
you're just not that fucking important anymore.
You're a no-name, an anecdote, history's footnote.
So enjoy your war games. I'm going back to my life.
[Dick] Ellie? Ellie?
-Ellie! -Need to lie down for a bit, Dad!
If you choose to live a perverted lifestyle,
you shouldn't ask to be rewarded for it.
-[vehicle approaches] -[dog barking] You should have the right to live, do and act as you please with no one invading your bedroom.
with no one invading your bedroom. But you should not expect the government to reward you for your misbehavior.
So here. We're not out to deny civil rights for anyone. We're not out to give special privileges...
[man on TV] Well, what has Nicaragua done to us to make you so angry?
-[Elena gasps] You're just... Dad! -Jesus, what the hell are you doing?
-You were out? -Right.
Where is the nurse? You shouldn't be driving!
Where is the nurse? You shouldn't be driving! What am I supposed to do, take my teeth out
and go into the nursing home? You want a drink?
I sent her home. She's not a real nurse anyway.
Jeez Louise.
-Scared the shit out of me. -[scoffs]
What's this shit?
If you were interested at all in what I'm doing as I told you before...
If it pans out the way it's supposed to pan out,
I'll be in a position to fold my hand,
take the Kitty Rex down past Largo,
and just stay there, catching fish,
bumming around the shallows,
sleeping with newly widowed--
Dad. Of course, that's not my original idea of a good time, but...
Of course, that's not my original idea of a good time, but...
it beats sitting around here, getting old.
Now... [exhales]
I patched things up with Sedlow.
All you have to do is fly down there tomorrow
and make the collection for me, please.
[Dick] Please, Ellie.
Ellie...
Thank you, Jesus.
When's the last time you heard from your mother? Pretty Kitty.
When's the last time you heard from your mother? Pretty Kitty. My Kit-Cat.
She should really call me more often, you know?
-[Sedlow] That's not the deal. -So what is our deal?
You tell me to show up, I show up. Feels like you just trotted me around.
You tell me to show up, I show up. Feels like you just trotted me around. Can you blame me? Huh?
Look, I don't know you.
What, all of a sudden I'm just supposed to trust you because the old man sent you?
That's not how it works.
-And what if I don't like how it works? -[scoffs] You don't like it?
[chuckles] You don't like it? Let me tell you something.
This isn't no fucking restaurant review, okay?
"You don't like it."
See these crates?
All this is you now.
Is there an inventory list?
Everything is here. They know what they're buying. Okay?
If somebody tells you something is off,
which nothing is,
you tell them to go fuck themselves.
Okay? You just make sure
that you don't take your eyes off of any of this
until they pay.
Dick said a million in traveler's checks.
Who's dropping it? Who's counting it? Where will you be in all this?
Somebody's going to meet you.
Your need-to-know has stopped right there.
You just be at gate J
at midnight by yourself,
ready to get on the plane and get the deal done.
Period.
You spit when you talk.
You love it.
Why do you have a bag? Don't take a bag. You're not staying.
You deliver the goods, you pick up the payment,
and you get on the plane. That's my deal.
-I thought Cheers was on-- -Get the babysitter out of here.
Do you mind?
That one's not a real nurse.
The one that comes in the morning is a nurse.
This one's a babysitter and she steals my shoes.
-Okay, Dad... -Don't let anybody Mickey Mouse you into staying. You follow me?
into staying. You follow me?
If anyone gives you a hard time, you just tell 'em.
Tell 'em what?
Tell 'em... God damn...
You're...
Tell 'em they have to answer to Max Epperson,
and then you call. Promise you'll call.
-Okay. I'll call you. -You'll call me.
I remember.
Must be my frequent flyer.
First class right there.
All you.
Smells like Christmas.
That makes you Mrs. Claus.
Let's see who's been naughty. Open one.
-[Elena] What? -Open one.
Let's see what's inside.
Open it yourself.
That's not how things work.
I got nowhere particular to be, so...
it's up to you.
Open.
Colt's classic ArmaLite rifle número 15.
To military spec.
Where did you find this shit, huh?
Three-prong suppressor, high-impact fiber stock,
trigger-finger magazine release.
That'll work.
A Valmara 69.
Mrs. Claus, you shouldn't have!

-[whoops] -Are we all good? -Yeah. -Great. Let's settle up.
-Yeah. -Great. Let's settle up.
-Yeah, we're all settled, thank you. -No, no, no. What's your name?
I didn't ask you for your name.
And you don't need to know mine.
Hey, hey, somebody was supposed to meet me with payment.
Good luck with that.
Is this the payment?
Fly it down, fly it back. That's my contract.
Is this the payment?
-Got what you need? -[Elena] Shit.
Looks like you got shorted.
-Now you're short, too. We're not leaving. -I told you, I fly it down, I fly it back.
I don't take care of cargo, and I don't take care of passengers.
Wheels up, two minutes.
-[pants] You're supposed to pay me. -[toilet flushes]
Now, who forgot to tell me that?
If I don't get paid, and I don't show up, they're gonna be wondering why.
-Who's going to wonder? -[Elena] I think you know who.
Give me a name.
Epperson.
Max Epperson?
What are we doing here? Is this the pick-up?
You're doing nothing.
And what I'm doing doesn't concern you.
Anyone asks, tell them that you're waiting for Jones.
[in English] May I take your photo?
-[camera shutter clicking] -Beautiful.
[in English] Okay. Thank you.
-You had one job, and one job only. -[camera shutter clicks]
Driving the cattle through the goddamn fence.
Since you're the one who drove her to the fence,
you better manage it. [man] Hey.
What are you doing?
What's your name?
Making friends?
[boy] Just pass!
Jones! Gonna introduce your lady?
-Only lady I see out here is you. -[boy laughs]
You work with Epperson before?
Sure.
-And everything's going great, right? -Just fine.
That's not what I heard.
Hey, look, I'm just passing time.
Who sent you?
Nobody sent me. Who sent you?
Maybe we should make a pit stop.
We can keep going.
-Might be nice to stop. Talk a little. -Just drive, please.
Nice break could do us both some good.
You know, Epperson expects me in San José as soon as possible.
You think anyone give a shit about you out here?
I bet you didn't even tell anybody where you're going.
Top secret?
Let's see things for what they are.
First and foremost,
you skipped your flight.
Second...
there's nothing for you here.
Nothing back on the airstrip and nothing ahead in San José, let's be honest.
-Third-- -[tires squeal]
-[Elena pants] -[Jones] What the fuck?
Without fucking around, you are gonna get out of this car.
You know how to use that thing, fucking cocktail dress?
Slide across.
Okay.
Get out of the car.
Come on.
-[Jones grunts] -Get out of the car.
Kick the door.
And back away.
You think you're gonna get very far?
You'd be surprised.
Alma, it's me.
I need to know what you found on Epperson.
[sighs] It's five in the morning.
[Elena] Anything on him in Managua?
Shit.
I didn't expect a pop quiz.
Uh, anything connecting him to Costa Rica?
Uh, anything connecting him to Costa Rica? -Is he American, is he-- -[Alma] No, listen, I...
I didn't find anything
on anyone named Max Epperson. Nothing.
Like he doesn't exist.
You think that maybe your dad got it wrong or something?
No, no, no, no, no. Jones knew the name. I used it--
Who's Jones?
What happened? Where are you, exactly?
Listen, the plane, we landed... I don't know where. Somewhere in Nicaragua.
It took seven hours to drive here, so--
Drive? Wait, wait, w-- Where's "here"?
[Elena, speaking softly] San José. I'm in Costa Rica.
The shipment, it was huge.
Landmines, antipersonnel weapons... Only, it's not money they're sending back to the mainland, it's cocaine.
Only, it's not money they're sending back to the mainland, it's cocaine.
And it's financing for something else.
And this guy, Jones,
I think he's in with the Sandinistas.
He's working both sides. [sputters] That makes no sense.
[Elena] I know.
I know it was a quick decision, staying on,
but I wanna track it from this end.
Dick wasn't in the loop on any of this.
If I'd have gone back, things would've evaporated.
Send you what I have when I can.
Listen,
something did come up from one of the stringers down in Miami
when they were digging around about Epperson.
A guy named Bob Weir.
Dick never mentioned anyone by that name.
Well, apparently, this Bob Weir has a flair for showing up in interesting situations.
He was in Guatemala, for example, when Árbenz was overthrown.
He was in Managua when Somoza was overthrown,
and you remember San Salvador,
the press office raid?
The editor-in-chief, five other writers were assassinated
and guess who the last guy to go through the door was?
So Weir's CIA?
He could be CIA, he could be an asset, or he could just be a reliable source.
No one knows.
No one's been able to get a read on this guy.
And he's got the kind of face that you don't see.
All we do know about him
is when he shows up,
it's usually the end of something, not the beginning.
And guess whose name just showed up in Costa Rica?
Not bad for a 5:00 a.m. pop quiz, Guerrero.
I'll be careful.
Listen, can you, uh, get in touch with Dick for me?
-Let him know I'll be back tomorrow. -[Alma] All right.
Thanks.
And, if you please, your passport. I need to make a copy.
[Elena] Oh. Yeah, that's fine. Thank you.
-Here's your keys. -Oh.
You're all set.
-[woman] Cleaning. -No, gracias.
[Weir] You're driving the cattle through the goddamn fence.
[Jones] Anyone asks, tell them you're waiting for Jones.
[Dick] You just missed my partner. You know him, Epperson.
[Alma] I didn't find anything on Max Epperson. Nothing.
You think that maybe your dad got it wrong or something?
[Sedlow] Hello.
You there?
Hello?
Hello?
Look, you don't want to talk, I get it.
How did you find me?
[chuckles] You weren't on the plane, so where else could you be?
White woman,
middle of San José,
middle of the night, only two hotels in town...
You don't have to be a super sleuth to figure it out.
[sighs] Honey, relax, you're worse than your dad.
Look, let me just ask you something.
[scoffs] You tell me something.
Who was your guy that met the shipment in Florida?
'Cause it wasn't traveler's checks.
I know you're not doing this by yourself.
Look, take it easy, McMahon, okay?
Look, take it easy, McMahon, okay? Just back up a few steps.
The money is moving, okay?
[stammering] It's not like buying an ice cream cone.
There's paperwork.
Fuck you, Barry! These guys are not doing paperwork.
But you know who does do paperwork?
Uninvited guests in DEA jackets and ATF hats.
[breathes heavily] What's the address again?
Of the... mechanic's garage with no wrenches?
1665 Southwest 17th Street? You're open late, right?
It's not me calling the shots here.
[Elena] I want what my father is owed.
I want a plane ticket outta here tomorrow.
[Sedlow] You stay in the room. Somebody will be in touch.
[Treat] You have to consider the alternatives.
You can create a context for democracy
and maybe get your hands a little bit dirty,
or just opt out and let the other guy call it.
And the "other guys" being,
in this case, the Sandinistas?
-The "other guy" being socialism. -[Alma] Ah. [chuckles]
-"Communism by any other name..." -Mm-hmm. Um, and, so...
to the best of your knowledge,
could it be true that...  there are certain flights, certain...
unreported humanitarian aid flights
that quietly leave one or another southern city
with uninspected cargo...
whose destination is San José?
Flights that, of course,
don't land
in San José, and literally fly under the radar
for the purpose of supplying arms to these so-called Contra forces.
No. Such flights could not be occurring.
Or such flights could be occurring, if in fact they are occurring,
outside the range of the possible knowledge of our intelligence agencies.
So which is it?
Are they occurring or are they not occurring?
We don't... we don't track that kind of activity.
Could someone in the administration have an interest in the area?
It would go without saying that we have an interest.
Well, thank you for speaking with me on such short notice. I appreciate it.
Oh, no, no, no. I have this.
Hooray for women's lib.
May I cite you as a source close to the White House?
No. Thank you.
Everything was to your liking?
Taxi, madam?
Yeah.
-[man] Thank you. -[church bells ringing distortedly]
[man] Thank you.
[echoing] Thank you. -Next, please. -[church bells ringing distortedly]
-If you please, your passport. -[hotel receptionist speaking Spanish]
[Sedlow] You stay in the room. Somebody'll be in touch.
-[echoing] Thank you. -[Jones] Think you're gonna get very far?
Next, please.
Step forward, please.
Purpose of your visit to Costa Rica?
Vacation.
How long?
Uh, uh, uh, two days ago.
The agency said I didn't need a passport, but I got one anyway.
And the, uh, agency gave me a tourist card, which I gave to the officer, so...
[taxi driver] Excuse me. Hey, miss!
Miss! Miss, miss!
Miss! Hey.
Miss, you forgot your bag. Your bag.
No...
-Yes, you forgot your bag. -No, you're mistaken. This is not my bag.
-Here, take this. -No, no!
-That's not my bag! -It's yours!
-No, it's not my bag! It's not! -Let me see that.
-[stammering] There's a luggage tag. -No.
My name is Meyer.
I did... There's a tag. There's--
-[man] No, it's your bag. -No...
Dick McMahon.
Yes, it's not my bag. I'm Elise Meyer. [breathes heavily]
Mr. McMahon's no longer here.
As I said, he's had a setback.
What do you mean, he had a setback?
He was taken to the hospital. Wait, what?
Where was his night nurse?
There was supposed to be somebody watching him.
-His evening care was canceled. -By whom?
-His daughter requested the cancellation. -No, there's been a huge mistake.
Okay, all right, listen to me.
What hospital has he been taken to?
-Are you family? -Yes.
-Name and relationship? -I'm his step-daughter.
-I don't see any listing. -Tell me what hospital they took him to!
"Treat Austin Morrison, ambassador-at-large,
BA, University of California, Berkeley.
Graduate, National War College.
Commissioned second lieutenant, US Army.

Widower.
Young widower.

America's man on the spot in the world's hottest spots." [chuckles]
It all depends on where you wanna locate the beginning of your story.
Any preference?
You know, a lot of people get some mystical kick
out of dwelling on things that happened 40...
45 years ago.
Sad little stories about being misunderstood by your mother,
being snubbed at school. I-I just...
never found any use for going over that stuff.
Not that there's anything wrong with it.
I don't think it's self-indulgent, self-pitying, or any other damn thing.
I don't think it's self-indulgent, self-pitying, or any other damn thing. I just can't afford it.
So I don't do it.
Ah, it doesn't matter where it begins. [sniffs]
You're right. [grunts]
What matters...
is what happens next.
What's the next line going to read?
No line. Berquist wants it deleted.
Berquist is a... [sighs]
a legislative branch kind of man.
The most he can ever hope for, and he won't succeed, is the House of Reps.
Not the Senate, because nobody likes him.
All he'll ever be is one out of 435.
But you...
You're an executive branch kind of man, Treat.
This office,
or a bigger one a whole lot like it, that's what I bet.
Don't get in the way of Berquist's agenda.
[Shultz] If it doesn't serve you.
I think Berkie's little side project...
will serve you in a way you have not yet foreseen.
Let him get his hands dirty.
-[eating] He's aiming for one out of 435. -Very good.
You're aiming for one out of one.
[eating] Just remember...
You, me, Berquist...
we're all having the same dish.
But you'd be better off...
using a spoon.
Scrape down the sides,
no remainders.
Nothing missed.
At what hotel are you staying?
Hotel?
Yeah, Ramada,
uh, Royale Caribe, InterCon... Ramada. Ramada.
We had a real life, and now we don't.
And just because I'm your daughter, I'm supposed to like it, and I don't.
-Cat-- -[Cat] No.
What exactly did you have in Malibu that you don't have now?
You could open the door and be at the beach,
in the Jacuzzi, or the tennis court.
[sighs] Anything else?
The three cars. We had three cars.
Fine.
A Jacuzzi, a tennis court, and three cars. Is that your idea of a real life?
No.
[Elena] I'm sorry, sweetie, that wasn't... That wasn't what I--
[cries] My father. I had my father, thank you very much.
Checking in. McMahon, Elena. I called earlier.
Fresh cut coco!
Fresh cut coco!
Fresh cut coco!
Fresh cut coco!
Fresh cut coco!
Coco!
[woman] Name tag?
Happy Fourth of July. Name tag?
Happy Fourth of July.
Happy Fourth of July.
Tomorrow morning is too late. I need to speak to someone now.
I-I need the passport immediately so I can return to the States.
Ma'am, I'm sorry. All offices are closed today for the Fourth of July picnic.
That's happening here, right?
-Yes, ma'am. -So I can speak to someone now.
No, ma'am, there are no appointments today.
But I wouldn't need an appointment to just speak to someone at the picnic, right?
Theoretically, ma'am, but I can't let you in without a passport.
[sobs] Wh-- Just--
Fine, fine.
What can I get started for you?
[Treat] I'll have an Early Times and soda, please.
I was just leaving.
Too late now.
Is that a last meal?
Thank you.
Read any news today?
Interesting scoop from a friendly agent about a woman no one seems to know.
No record of departing the States, brief stay at a hotel in San José,
No record of departing the States, brief stay at a hotel in San José, false passport, slipped past Antiguan Immigration.
false passport, slipped past Antiguan Immigration.
Fascinating.
You ready to go on record with any of that, Mr. Morrison?
Already have.
Reporter by the name of Guerrero, Atlantic Post.
So you're connected. [chuckles]
Well, my usual target's been out of touch, but I hear she's--
Is it normal for you to be a step behind?
Wait for someone like me to be in a bind,
squeeze a bit of distress into the math so it feels urgent all of a sudden?
Something you can sink your well-filed teeth into
while a secretary forwards your calls?
Could be.
But if you had to pick someone with a byline to drop classified intel with,
wouldn't you pick you?
Pennsylvania Avenue reporter with a moral compass
capable of pointing off the campaign trail
and delivering a load of munitions in South America? [chuckles]
Must be worth reading.
You think?
I didn't realize you quasi-spook types did any reading.
Not the brightest move, showing up at the embassy.
In a perfect world, we'd make perfect choices.
In the real world, we make real choices.
It's not a zero-sum deal.
Wasn't that your entire thesis at last year's presentation
Wasn't that your entire thesis at last year's presentation to the Council on Foreign Relations?
Did you cover that?
I covered many interesting happenings before my desk got frozen
and I was relegated to following around the circus,
filing white propaganda about all the elephant shit.
[chuckles] Okay. Fair enough.
Tell you what.
Let's, uh...
talk about other interesting happenings.
[Elena] Dick McMahon's my father.
I took his place on a ghost plane out of Fort Lauderdale on June 29th,
1:20 in the morning.
A big-bellied Lockheed
with enough guns, bullets, mines, and C-4 to take Managua.
I hustled into the open.
No payday.
No protection. No plan.
Just a game no one let me in on.
A secret war.
Now I got a passport with a trick built into it and no ticket home.
[Treat] That I know.
What I don't know is why you're still here.
I came for the money.
Stayed for the scoop.
Nice try.
I came for my father, stayed for the story.
Closer.
All right.
I don't know why I came.
But I stayed...
I... stayed because I was losing focus.
I can feel it happening again.
I was...
[breathes raggedly] I was losing...
momentum on Catherine, my daughter.
And I knew that if I...
walked away from this...
I would just... I would just walk away from everything. I would just...
walk away.
And all I want to know...
is what you're doing here.
What you're doing in the picture.
What...
if not stirring the pot?
[Treat] I thought you were the one.
[Elena] I thought you were the one.
I thought you were the one they sent to kill me.
I was ready.
Diane had a scar like this.
Then she just went. [sighs]
"The seal's wide spindrift gaze..."
Something,
"Galleons of Carib fire..."
Something, something.
"The seal's wide spindrift gaze towards paradise."
Diane loved poetry.
Alcestis.
Back from the tunnel and half in love with death.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow what?
Tomorrow we leave.
-[Caribbean music plays] -[people chattering]
-[man] Come on. Give me this. -[woman] What? No.
-[man] Come on. Give me this. -[woman] What? No. -[man] This is the second time. -[woman] Can you give it back?
-[man] This is the second time. -[woman] Can you give it back? [man] No. Come on.
-Yes. -No.
-No. -Listen, you can't sell here. No.
-[woman] Can I sell this? -[man] No, you can't sell this. No.
-Chalatenango. Unbelievable. -This is the second time.
-Chalatenango. Unbelievable. -This is the second time. Shit, at least when you drive a stake through a vampire's heart,
-the fucker dies. -Hey.
-[man] Good time, man -[woman] Yeah, man.
-[man] Have a good night. -[woman] Catch you later.
Coming in tomorrow?
-No. -Give it back to me!
Hey.
-Elena! -[gunfire]
[man over PA] Guests, please stay in your rooms...
Your countrymen aren't your countrymen. There's no reason you should be here.
But you can't tell me who you are or how you know any of this.
I think they just spelled the story out in bullets, yes?
[honks horn] Through there! Through there! Make we pass!
Make we pass! [honks horn]
Hey, make we pass, brethren!
[honking] Hey, make we pass, through there!
[Jones] Don't you see?
They had to give your father a figure big enough to lure him out.
A magical million-dollar payday.
He's a half-crazy old man in a sick season. -My father is not-- -[Jones] He's a man
-My father is not-- -[Jones] He's a man with a well-documented history
of not caring where his merchandise showed up.
And so, he's a man very easily placed on the wrong side of whatever was supposed to happen.
on the wrong side of whatever was supposed to happen.
"Gunrunner bleeds out in... in-- in terrorist attack at Caribbean resort."
So what?
Who would miss him?
Who would care?
You?
File closed.
Finished and done.
[laughs] But you...
You, Elena...
But you showed up instead.
And the file is still closing.
All the little scraps and pieces being assembled for the archive,
to be forgotten.
And yours is the last name on it.
The passport, it--
The only trick of the passport was to keep you in play.
You could have got on a plane and left this place.
No, the passport wouldn't be valid for re-entry to the US,
at which point you would have been taken.
Rescued, rather, by the authorities, which gave you more of a reason to leave.
But no.
You... you're still here.
All I have left is this story, I admit it.
Do you know who...
the unreported casualties of... of Vietnam were?
The reporters...
who couldn't move past it.
[man] Hey, Jones.
All clear.
You can stay here. There's a phone across the square.
One day, maybe two.
I'll talk with my comrades on getting us a boat.
We are meant to survive beyond our stories.
Guerrero speaking.
-It's me. -[Alma] Elena?
Call Catherine's father. Call Wynn.
When you hang up with me, call him.
Tell him to go to Catherine's school. Tell him to go get her.
Tell him not to send anybody. Tell him he's gotta go himself, in person.
And tell him I need him to keep her, just until I get back.
Done. Ellie...
Dick is dead.
I know.
[Alma] They moved him the night after you left. The hospital wouldn't let me see him.
And then I wasn't sure if I should reach you or if reaching you would expose you, but...
I'm sorry, Elena. But listen.
My sources are telling me that there is a French intelligence operative down there
investigating the same thing that we are.
Okay? I don't have a name yet,
but they could get you a special visa and get you out of there.
[sighs] These people are starting to move faster.
The InterCon assassination attempt...
-I was there. -[Alma] I know.
I know. Look, we're all over it down here. But you should be safe for now.
They're beefing up the military presence.
No, the military was already there in full force before the attempt.
They knew it was coming.
And I was meant to be there.
Two birds, one stone. The file closes.
[Alma] What?
The date on my bogus passport's the same day Dick died.
[Alma] Okay, calm down.
Listen. Just stay where you are for now.
"Gunrunner bleeds out in terrorist attack."
You showed up instead.
[Alma] Hello?Elena?
Elena? Hello?
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
There are two things I need you to know right away.
The first thing I need you to know is that you get to go back to Malibu.
Your dad's coming to pick you up.
Do not go with anyone except your dad. Do you understand?
The second thing I need you to know...
is that I love you.
Sometimes... [inhales]
we argue and... about things, but I...
I think you know...
I only argue because I want your life to be happy and good.
[cries] Want you not to waste your time.
Not to waste your talent.
Not to let who you are get mixed up with anyone else's idea of who you should be.
I know you're nodding.
I love you the most. You're my Kit-Cat.
[sighs] Okay.
Everything's set. A car will take you.
His name is Paul. He's expecting you.
No one will look for you there. Now, I've been working with the consulate.
No one will look for you there. Now, I've been working with the consulate. We're gonna extract you in the next few days.
If anything happens, don't come to me. It's too dangerous for you here.
I'll come to you. Okay?
Can I help you?
Hi.
Uh, I'm Elise. Elise Meyer.
Highly recommended Elise Meyer of Miami?
Get up here. Let's get you started already.
Who wants to be sitting around a bunch of jarheaded machos downtown
when you can live right on the edge of paradise?
So, this job is not complicated at all.
Each day, 10:00 a.m. sharp,
routinely,
pick us up fruit from the vendor at Heritage Market.
I can get it from closer.
No, Heritage Market. Thank you.
Guavas from the stall near the entrance.
Uh, pick us up newspapers from the little woman two streets over.
And get all the newspapers. I like to be well-read.
Plus, when guests come, we want to be prepared.
And, uh, let me see.
We have a cook, Evelina,
who comes every day at five and handles supper,
who comes every day at five and handles supper, so you don't need to worry about that.
But just, you know...
tidy things.
I could wipe the chairs.
They said you were sharp.
Do you know this?
Gary Geld, composer. Peter Udell and Ossie Davis did the book.
It's delicious.
Melba Moore version was my favorite.
Melba Moore was criminally underrated.
Pas de critics.
So anyway, all that should take you through 2:00 p.m. every day.
And no shortcuts. Pas de shortcuts.
After that, your day is your own.
Isn't this lovely?
What could be lovelier?
Take the day.
Get settled in.
Oh, and, uh... be kind to the generator.
We need lights, but not every day.
I only do the petrol run once a week and I want to keep it that way.
[Paul] Elise, happy hour!
Coming!
[Paul] Happy, happy hour.
[Paul] It was complicated.
I could tell you stories.
-[Elena chuckles] No. -I'm not gonna say any names, but...
if I did tell you the names,
-you'd recognize every single one of them. -[laughs]
And then, there was Haiti,
which I adored.
I was mostly single there, of course.
Just a man about town.
I ran the first, and...
for all I care to know, the only
for all I care to know, the only first-rate gay bathhouse in all of Port-au-Prince.
And again, no names,
but my patrons were some of the most major operators on Wall Street,
the hottest of the hot, motion picture,
and agents and executives. I mean, the biggest.
Of all the places, you know?
I feel like that...
could have been the place.
But then I got scared away when dead chickens started showing up on my gate.
I mean, I may not be the smartest Nellie on the block,
but, hey, when I see a dead chicken,
I know what it means.
I know how to take a hint.
Pas de poulet.
Pas de voodoo.
Pas de Port-au-Prince,
so I ended up here.
Bob set me up.
We did a great business.
Every room was filled every single weekend.
And for a while, we ran a beautiful trade with the European set.
But then, a few neighbor-island coups and bombings later,
it trickled down to the backpackers, and then...
several State Department warnings later, and we were down to this.
So, why did you stay?
Why are you still here?
I could ask you the same question.
But me, I...
I guess I stayed because I have a very,
very high tolerance for pleasure.
Tell Evelina to set the table for three tonight.
My friend is coming.
Who's that?
My friend. The one I told you about?
Bob?
No.
The other friend.
Be a dear, fetch me a refill.
[Paul] I mean, it's not like the vacancy sign
[Paul] I mean, it's not like the vacancy sign isn't burning a hole in my electric bill or anything.
Like I keep telling you, there's people I know who can help you.
People we've met here in the past.
I say, sure, take a room.
Fill it with whatever on earth you want.
Rum punch?
Be a dear, leave it on the side, Elena.
Move it in, move it out, who cares?
Just cut me in.
Drop me a bit of this Colombian jet fuel from weekend to weekend and I'll be sweet.
We've done this before. [stammering] I told you...
...here in the past.
I can create your future for you.
[Paul] Elise!
[yells] Elise!
Oh, fuck it.
Evelina!
Wipe the chairs, Elise.
[Treat] If anything happens, don't come to me. It's not safe for you here anymore.
I'll come to you.
[Weir] Does she know something?
-Did you tell her something? -[Paul] Of course I didn't tell her.
Don't do it the hard way.
You could ride the cattle right through the fence.
...driving the cattle through the goddamn fence.
You just missed my partner. You know him, Epperson.
-[Elena] I don't know him. -[Dick] Yeah, you do. You remember.
Hey, Maxie.
-Make with the grill and lay on some chow. -Hey, Ellie.
The sparks won't burn you because...
they're cold.
[Alma] Epperson. Like he doesn't exist.
-A guy named Bob Weir did come up. -[fireworks exploding]
Bob set me up.
[Alma] When he does show up,
it's usually the end of something, not the beginning.
[Paul] Elise?
Is that you?
She'll be back up later.
He's there.
Bob Weir.
Oh, fuck. Come in.
[Elena] Out beyond the ocean.
All salt-heavy and thick with fish.
What do think's out there?
[Treat] Suppose there's nothing out there, actually. No there.
Plane will be there at eight o'clock tomorrow.
An unmarked will take you to the airstrip. It's ours. You'll be safe.
I'm gonna stay a few days till everything levels out, clear some smoke.
Says the secret agent man as he walks into the fire.
Easy Rider of the geopolitic,
too cool for the press pool.
Stop. True reporter.
Pure spin.
Pick you up at the cove by the Surfrider at 6:00.
Make sure you have your notes and the film.
Otherwise it's all fucked anyway.
Unless you think they already found them and it's too late.
No, I stashed them.
Good.
[Elena] I'll try to be home before school starts.
[Cat] Home where?
[Elena] Home wherever you are, Cat.
I'll call you tomorrow before I get on the plane.
Tomorrow when?
[Elena] Probably three o'clock your time.
I'll be there.
[Cat] Promise?
[Elena] Okay.
I promise.
[Cat] I'll be waiting.
[automated voice] ...to make a call, please hang up and try again.
If you need help, hang up, and then dial your operator.
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
If you need help, hang up, and then dial your operator.
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
[Elena] Some real things have happened lately.
[Elena] First, I wanted to know who.
Who chose money over life?
Steel and lead over blood and spirit?
Who the war pig?
Who the profiteer?
Who the cold heart, the vapid soul?
[Treat] Elena!
[Elena] And second...
Second, I wanted to know why.
[Treat] Tomorrow. [Elena] Tomorrow what?
Tomorrow we leave.
[Treat] The suspect then wheeled on me,
pulling a firearm...
wounding me in the shoulder.
I returned fire...
in course, killing her.
I think... [sighs]
I think she knew she was caught.
You know...
you think you have it covered,
and find out you don't have it covered worth a goddamn.
It added all up, but...
it won't bring her back.
[Jones speaking French] Elise Meyer.
Elena Janklow. Elena McMahon.
Alleged assassin.
Reporter.
American.
Mother. Daughter.
Sandinista sympathizer.
[speaking French] Unfortunately, our initial attempt at interception...
[in English] This way, please.
[in French] ...was unsuccessful.
[Jones speaking French] Some would say she was waiting for a payday.
Some would say she was caught in the glare.
I think Elena McMahon got caught in the glare.
The water was over her head.
I think she realized what she had been set up to do
only in however many seconds there were between the time she registered Morrison on the bluff...
and when he pulled the trigger.
[man] Why'd she do it?
I don't have an answer for that kind of tragedy.
The truth is, it's just a hell of a bad outcome.
The last outcome you would ever have wanted.
[Elena] Some real things have happened lately.
But we were moving fast.
We were traveling light.
We were younger.
I was younger.
"All part of...
history's rough draft," we used to say.
History's footnote.
And yet...
It's a new one. Not gonna matter.
[man] Easy.
You sure about this? White Fang don't look himself.
He's fine.
-But you put him up against two dogs. -Which means twice the money, right?
Time for our main event!
Jocko and Scratch, champions in their own right,
will face the monster, the wolf dog legend of the Klondike,
the terror of Fort Yukon,
White Fang!
-Hear that? -[growls]
You know what comes next, don't you? Now, get in there and make me some money.
Come on!
Come on!
[chanting] White Fang! White Fang!
[man] Come here!
Fight!
Get out of my way! Let me through. What--
Oh, no.
US Marshal Weedon Scott.
Every lawman in the territory heard that shot, so you better get moving.
Not you. You stay put.
[Weedon] What is this?
Two against one? Ain't it enough you make these dogs fight?
You make me sick.
It was Smith's idea, I swear it.
Me? I'm the aggrieved party here.
-That's my dog got tore up. -Save it!
I'm going to make sure you do time for this.
[male voice] Weedon!
I'm in here, Hank!
-What did you do? -Forget it. Help me get my dog.
[man] This way!
Where is he?
This ain't over, lawman.
Weedon!
-Are you all right? -Is he still breathing?
Hurry up, Weedon! They're getting closer.
Let's go!
Them wolves ain't giving up.
They're smart. They'll keep clear of the fire.
And the rifles.
You should've shot them when you had the chance.
It's been a rough winter. I'm not going to kill wolves just for being hungry.
That's your problem, Marshal. You ain't no killer.
Good.
Look where killing got you.
I'll bust these chains long before they put a rope around my neck.
Then I'm gonna kill you before I go anywhere.
I'll bear that in mind.
I'm gonna see to the dogs.
Easy! Easy!
Calm down.
Hey, Weedon, how many dogs we got?
Since the wolves got Bunk and Jimmy, we got six.
Well, we got seven now.
Come on.
Grab the picket line, will you?
Where'd she come from?
Must be a stray. Bet she ran off when some miner dumped his outfit.
Well, she's smart, that's for sure. -Think we could use her for the team? -Nah. She's got a game leg.
-Think we could use her for the team? -Nah. She's got a game leg.
Decent thing would be to put her down.
If that ain't the littlest wolf I've ever seen.
Come on, Marshal. Put a bullet in that one.
-That .30-30 should take care of him. -I'd shoot you first.
Give me a strip of that salmon. Pup or not, that's a wolf.
This guy is as much dog as he is wolf. And he's got grit.
Come on.
It's okay.
Come on, buddy.
[clicks tongue] It's okay.
Ain't you the soft touch.
Who knows? Maybe one day he'll return the favor.
See you around, kid.
-Three Eagles! Give me a hand. -What?
Here you go.
Wolf!
Stop!
That's Kiche. She used to be my fastest sled dog.
A dog that runs off does not come back.
They do if they're hungry.
Kiche.
Look at her leg. She'll never pull a sled.
And I think she will.
Ha! Kiche will pull a sled, but you will never tame that monster.
He's got more teeth than brains.
You must see the opportunity.
Kiche has brought us a pup with spirit.
We will call you White Fang.
You'll be the greatest sled dog ever.
Well done, Kiche.
White Fang.
Whoa! Whoa, now!
Hold there.
-Grandfather. -What is it, Vichi?
A man has arrived at the village. He's waiting for you.
Do not worry.
Hold this for me, please.
Marshal Todd. Grey Beaver.
Good to see you again.
What brings you here, so far away from the city? I'm afraid I got bad news.
With the recent gold strike, the territory has plans to sell this land.
Sell this land?
We have been here since before my grandfather's time. We cannot move further up north.
-There's nothing for us there. -I'm sorry.
How much does the territory hope to get for the land?
A concern in Whitehorse has offered $450.
American.
You like those mittens?
Better than anything in Fort Yukon, that's for sure.
-Would you buy them for a dollar? -Sure. I'd even buy 'em for two.
So, as I was saying they-- -We will buy the land.
We'll pay $500 dollars.
Now? I mean, do you have that kind of money?
We will have the money.
Then I guess we have a deal.
I'll inform them that we have come to an agreement.
I'll see you at the end of December.
Now, if you will excuse me. And for the mittens?
Please, keep them as a gift.
What do we do now? I will go north, across the river.
You and the other men spread out to the south.
Every man with traps goes out.
The women have enough pelts to start sewing. We will not stop until we have the mittens we need.
I will sell them in Fort Yukon, and we will buy back our land.
You can count on us.
Kiche!
Listen up, everyone. We have work to do.
You must run harder.
If you are not ready, we cannot wait.
I was wrong. You are ready.
William. I thought we'd agreed you'd stay south of the river.
We did. But my people need pelts.
[William] We all need pelts.
Sit.
Let's talk.
You have done well. You will go with William now.
[William] Good hunting.
This is where William traps. But now, because of Kiche, we can trap these streams.
The time for mothers is over.
This is how it feels to be grown.
They resent that you are first dog.
You must lead this team, but they will not follow you until they respect you.
They are not like you. They only know food and fear.
I cannot do this for you. You will have to make them see.
Grandfather?
I will be back soon, and you will be in charge during my absence.
Do not worry. You will find this village in the same way you left it.
I will take care of everything.
I know you will. Make sure you tell them not to worry.
This is for you, Grandfather.
Thank you, child.
Besides, I have a beautiful pouch made for me by my granddaughter.
[laughing] And a friend to keep me company.
Before men came for the gold... -[distant indistinct voices] -...it was not like this.
But we will be fine.
We will sell the mittens we've made and get away from this place.
Let's find a place to spend the night.
-[man] Prepare to shore! -[man 2] Stand by!
[man] Yeah, you don't want to have that before the snow comes. [man 2] I ain't ate in two days.
[man 3] I think they will, as far as the territory.
[man 4] Uh-huh. Get a piece out.
-[man] What's the matter? Go on, now! -[barks]
Go on, now! Get!
-Go on! Get! -[barking and growling continue] You're upsetting my dog.
[Grey Beaver] We are bothering no one. Move on, and your dog will be fine.
[man] I don't take orders from Indians.
Anybody moves, it's gonna be you.
We want no trouble.
That's right. You don't.
Where'd that Indian get off acting like he's so much better than you are?
-Don't worry. I got a surprise for him. -[growls]
[Grey Beaver] No!
Stop!
-[White Fang growls] -White Fang! A-tcha!
That dog is a killer.
You all right, boy?
[man] Come on, let's go.
[male voice] Hey, you.
Yes?
That dog's a born fighter, brother. Train him right, and there'd be no stopping him.
He is a sled dog.
So, what do you say?
-What do I say about what? -Come on, name your price.
-How much for the dog? -He's not for sale.
Good evening.
Hey, brother, wait a sec.
Hey, don't get me wrong. I was trying to help.
So, tell me, what brings you around here?
-Buying stuff for your people? -No.
I'm selling mittens for my village. Mittens? Oh, you ain't gonna sell these mittens.
Fella ain't allowed up here unless he's fully outfitted.
I will sell them. I must.
You got money trouble.
I need $500 dollars for my village.
You see now, that's where it's good to have a friend in me.
I'd pay 500 for that mutt of yours. Right here, right now.
I will sell you mittens. I'm only doing this because we're pals.
Every last soul in Fort Yukon's got food for a year,
and oilskin, and gum boots, and gloves.
Anyone who thinks these are good enough has never spent a winter up north.
These will not keep you warm. Not when they are wet.
I made you a fair offer, and you walk away?
I want that dog!
White Fang! A-tcha!
-[growls] -White Fang, come.
This ain't over yet!
White Fang. Come.
Come on in.
We will wait until it gets cold.
The mittens will sell better at night.
In the meantime, we rest.
[customer] There. Two dollars.
-[man] Wow! -Thank you.
That's a heck of a deal, huh? Let me see what you got.
[customer] I'll see.
Sell me one for one dollar? I only got the one dollar.
Do you want me to take care of him?
No need for that. I got a plan.
[customer] There you go.
Thanks for the bargain.
Don't worry, brother, I know when I'm beat. I just want to buy me a pair of those wonderful mittens.
See how these fit.
I'm sure they're fine.
But look here. All I got is a ten.
A man of means like myself. I don't suppose you could change that.
-You'll be very happy with these. -I already am.
-[man] I'll take a pair over here. -[man 2] I need another one.
You know what to do.
[Grey Beaver] Very warm. Even when wet.
-[man] I want two. -Two dollars.
See? We have sold everything.
Now we can go home.
-[man] Come on, now! -[man 2] Hey! How you doing, partner?
-Hello. No. -How about a drink?
Come on. Beautiful night. -Beautiful bottle. -[growls]
-Beautiful bottle. -[growls]
-I'm feeling generous. -No, thank you.
-You're not fun at all. -I must go.
All right.
Sorry. Excuse me.
No!
No!
Where did it go?
No!
The village.
No. Why-- Where--
How?
Why-- Oh, no!
[anguished] No!
What's the matter, huh? Your luck take a turn?
-[growls] -You know what happened.
You accuse me of something you can't prove,
I can have you thrown in jail. Is that what you want?
No. I want my money.
Well, that's a problem.
'Cause now you ain't got no more mittens.
But you do got that dog, now, don't you?
I said I'd pay top dollar for a dog like that one.
I think you would take my soul if you could.
Devil can have your soul. I just want your dog.
Come on, we got work to do.
We could make a mint fighting this dog. But it won't work unless he knows I'm the boss.
Give me your cane.
When I'm finished, he'll mind whoever's holding this.
You hear that?
-[growls] -This is what submission sounds like.
You'll remember this and obey.
[man] Whoa, one at a time. What do you got?
-One at a time. -Ten.
Ten bucks there. Ten bucks there.
-Twenty. -Ten, the guy in the middle.
-What you got? -Thirty bucks.
-Thirty bucks for the short man! -Twenty!
One at a time. Hold on a minute.
-All right, what you got? -Twelve.
-Okay, gentlemen. Thank you. -Right, fellas, that's it. No more bets.
I promised you something special! And now's the time!
I promised you something special! And now's the time! You've all seen Laddie fight!
And tonight he's up against a new dog!
White Fang!
-[Smith] There you go. -[growls]
All right, boy. Go on, get him!
[chanting] White Fang! White Fang!
White Fang! White Fang!
-[chanting continues] -[chuckles]
There's plenty of time to get your bets. Take it easy.
[chanting] White Fang! White Fang!
[announcer] Time for our main event!
Jocko and Scratch, champions in their own right...
-[scraping] -Hear that?
You know what comes next, don't you? Now, get in there and make me some money!
[announcer] The terror of Fort Yukon, White Fang!
Fight!
Wait!
Hello?
-[low growl] -It's all right. Everything's all right.
Here.
We're not going to hurt you.
Weedon!
Weedon?
Tell me again why we left California. Don't joke.
Just take it easy.
I'm fine. I'm okay.
Oh, well, in that case, I'm not talking to you.
-Then I guess I'd better be going. -Whoa, whoa. You're not going anywhere.
You may be the law in Fort Yukon, but around here, I give the orders.
You know...
a few days at home doesn't sound so bad.
It better not.
There was a dogfight.
Hmm. That explains the wolf.
Is it a wolf?
How do you know?
-They brought it home with you. -What?
Marshal Todd brought it home with you. They had to, you wouldn't let it go. -He's pretty badly hurt. -Don't go near it!
-He's pretty badly hurt. -Don't go near it! Hurt or not, that thing is dangerous!
They said that about you once, too.
Now stay here, get some rest.
"White Fang. The terror of the Yukon"?
Poor thing.
Hey, you're up.
All better now.
-Hey, is that for me? -Nope.
See? I'm not so bad. I brought you more.
White Fang, right?
Okay, let's see. Carrots here,
beetroots, squash...
Hmm. You're right where the squash is going to be.
Come on.
Easy.
Easy.
Stop, stop, stop. That's enough.
Thank you.
You did great.
Let it go.
Good.
Yeah.
We're not so bad, are we?
Maggie, you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.
Careful with that dog!
Now, that's enough of that. It's time you two got along.
It's the cane. I think it scares him. Can you walk without it?
I can try.
Weedon Scott, meet White Fang. White Fang, meet Weedon Scott.
White Fang. It was on the flyer. But...
how do you know?
I found it in your coat. From when they brought you home.
It turns out he's the terror of the Yukon, aren't you, boy?
-I thought I was the terror of the Yukon. -You are an angel.
You both are.
So, let's get a look at you.
Come on, it's okay.
Come on. [clicks tongue]
It's okay.
Hey!
I think he knows you. How?
I know him, too.
What do you know?
Look at you.
Good night, White Fang.
Maggie.
I guess there's a hole in the chicken coop. I guess so.
And I think we forgot we have a wolf living here.
-So, we can't keep chickens? -He's gonna kill them.
That's what wolves do.
Not this one. Not if I tell him not to.
White Fang. Come.
First, we plug up this hole.
And then we go inside.
There's so much about this place that needs to change.
And these men are the worst of it, I know.
But in spite of the gold, the greed, and the cruelty,
we're trying to build something good and peaceful up here.
Now I know before the fighting and Fort Yukon you had a life out there.
And I know that killing's a part of who you are. But here you can't do that.
Please, please, please.
Don't kill chickens.
I'll be back in an hour.
You really think White Fang can learn not to kill chickens?
He's going to have to.
We need to know he can be just as gentle as a normal dog.
Especially if he's going to be around a baby.
Is he going to be around a baby?
He is if he stays with us.
Oh! Maggie!
-Oh, sorry. I should be careful. -You can hug your wife. I won't break.
You're strong again.
-You're better. -I know.
They'll be glad to have you back.
They'll be fine without me.
What are you saying?
Let's go back to California.
My brother needs help with the ranch. We'd have our own place.
She can grow up with more family than just you and some old lawman.
"She"?
I'm hoping she's just like her mother.
A boy wouldn't be so bad.
I wonder what White Fang's up to.
[gasps] I left him in the chicken coop!
I can't believe it. He did it.
Aww! The poor guy.
[Weedon] Good boy.
It was him, I tell you.
I was taking a shortcut through Crystal Creek. That's when I've seen him.
He's living with the marshal and his wife. He is alive and strong.
That's music to my ears.
We're going to make that marshal pay for what he did, then get my dog back.
He will regret he ever crossed Beauty Smith. Whoa.
Hold on a second. I ain't tangling with that marshal.
Don't you worry, my friend. We're not going there alone.
That fellow you mentioned, late of the territorial prison?
Ain't he got a beef with the marshal? People been talking lately.
And I think I know where to find him.
[male voice] So, you're the little fella who hit the marshal with your walking stick.
And now I know where he's hiding.
Thought you might like to finish the job. [chuckles]
That I would.
That I would.
Telegram from my brother and his wife.
We're all set.
They've already got a spot cleared for a house.
Our house.
Say... where is White Fang?
Say... where is White Fang? Well, he was here before.
I think I know.
[Weedon] I thought you might be here.
You know, in California it doesn't get cold like it does up here.
River never freezes where we live.
It's easier down there.
Better for a family.
The way things are, it's where we belong, Maggie and me.
Come on.
Afternoon, Marshal.
Did you really think that prison cell would hold me for long?
Just like old times, except I ain't wearing cuffs this time.
And you ain't gonna live.
Let me go!
Get him off me, please!
Get him off me! Help!
Go back to the house! Quick!
Beauty Smith.
So, I guess our friend squandered his chance to take you down.
Where's Maggie?
Where's my wife?
I'm just here for the dog, is all.
-There's no need to make this personal. -That's enough.
Curtis!
-Maggie. -Weedon.
You're going to jail.
I ain't going anywhere except home with that dog.
-Let me go! -Remember this?
[chuckles] I bet you do.
-[White Fang whimpers] -That's right, I give the orders.
[Maggie] Leave him be.
I said I give the orders!
You shouldn't have done me like you did, Marshal. Taking a man's livelihood ain't right.
-[low growl] -That dog is mine.
Don't!
What the--
You--
-[snarls] -But--
-Go after him. I'll take care of this one. -Uh-huh.
[Maggie] White Fang!
Don't let him kill me, please!
-Don't. -Please.
-Make sure those handcuffs are tight. -[man] Yes, sir.
Wouldn't want Jim Hall running off on us again.
Sorry all that had to happen. Not much of a going-away present, huh?
That's one hell of a watchdog you got yourself there.
It sure is, Hank.
He managed to put Jim Hall out of commission all by himself.
Don't know what we would have done without him.
He saved our lives.
Drop a line when you get to Frisco. Let me know what you want done with the cabin.
Well, it's all yours if you want it.
Yesterday, I would have said it was too quiet for my taste. We'll get it seen to.
Thank you, Hank.
What were we thinking?
We weren't.
We're going home.
You should go home, too.
[Weedon] It's okay.
We'll be fine.
Thank you.
For everything.

or the Standardized Test for International Colleges,
a general knowledge exam
for students who wish to apply to US universities.
This year, the body overseeing the exam discovered that a cheating incident occurred,
leading to the leaking of exam questions in many countries throughout Asia.
Further investigation is pending.
It's not mine.
My name is Rinrada Nilthep.
I'm in my final year at Krungthep Thaweepanya School.
You can call and check my academic record.
The STIC isn't beyond my abilities.
STUDENT RECORD: MISS RINRADA NILTHEP
GPA: 4.00, SEVENTH GRADE, ACADEMIC YEAR 2011
NINTH GRADE
Straight As since first grade.
Honor student from seventh grade to ninth grade.
First place in the school district's mathematics competition.
National Crossword Champion.
And in sports, this one is for swimming.
You don't have to say anything else.
It's enough already.
You don't have to ask anymore whether or not we want to accept Lynn.
Instead, you need to ask Lynn whether or not she wants to study here.
What do you say, honey?
I don't have to give my decision right now, do I?
It's not that I don't want to study here.
I just think my old school suits me better.
Because if I move here,
Dad will have to pay almost 150,000 a year.
How did you get 150,000?
One semester is only 60,000.
so that makes it 120,000 a year, right?
Correct.
However, I commute with my dad, as he teaches at my old school.
If I study here, I would have to take the Skytrain,
including the motorbike taxi from the station. That is 80 baht a day.
SKYTRAIN- 50 BAHT MOTORBIKE- 30 BAHT
Return trips over 8 months, which is 170 days,
excluding public holidays,
that makes it 13,600 baht per year.
Then there's the cost of lunches.
I get rice with 2 side dishes for 20 baht at my old school.
Here, it's 35 baht.
Then there's also the cost of my school supplies
and my new school uniform.
All in all, I think...
it might not be worth it.
NEW UNIFORMS- 1,184 BAHT NEW BOOKS- APPROX. 875 BAHT
Gold medal in math.
Honey.
I can afford it.
-No, you can't. -Yes, I can.
What if we waive the tuition fees?
Vit.
And let's include the free lunch program as well.
I want to show that we appreciate Lynn's academic abilities.
Is it worth it now?
It's worth it.
Now, it's worth bringing this.
It's worth it, right?
LETTER OF AUTHORIZATION
LYNN
TENTH GRADE
Done.
Wait!
We have to use this ID for the next three years.
You have to look good.
You're new here, aren't you?
I'm Grace.
I'm Lynn.
-What are you doing? -Let me have a look.
Take off your glasses.
Trust me.
Wow!
Pretty!
Come on, smile.
Ready? One, two...
Go now.
Quickly. Off you go.
GRACE
Our ID numbers follow each other, so we have sat together for three years.
Actually, we're really close.
Everyone says Lynn is smart. As for me, well...
I'm good at extracurricular activities.
Some people might even think I'm dumb.
This term, the headmistress came up with a new rule.
To be in the school play, you need a GPA of at least 3.25.
Why? I'm too dumb to appear in a school play?
I think acting is harder than studying.
Really?
Really.
Look.
I have had tutoring with Mr. Sophon for weeks,
but I still don't know shit.
And math really pulls my grades down.
The answer is C.
What?
You knew the answer after only a quick glance?
And upside down, too!
It's super easy.
Union A and B intersect with C. Do the ones in brackets first.
Then the intersection of C is just what's left in C.
-That's the answer. -Yes.
I got it!
Scholarship kids are really excellent.
One more question--
Will you be my tutor, Lynn?
Why not?
If you teach me, I'll buy you a milkshake every day.
No.
You'll get to review the lessons every evening.
Not enough.
What if...
If you agree,
I'll get to be your first student, Teacher Lynn.
Teacher Lynn!
Teacher Lynn!
Teacher Lynn.
I like the sound of that.
I'll teach you all of this today.
Grace told you that I helped her with her studies?
That's true.
But there's nothing wrong with tutoring a friend, right?
It's the time everyone has been waiting for.

I have warned you before that it's not easy.
People who knew that they didn't understand, but still didn't come to me for tutoring...
Well, it's too late for them now.
They're out of time.
Grace!
Grace!
The questions are just like those on the teacher's cheat sheet.
-Yes? -You can do it, right?
No.
What do you mean? I taught you already.
I can't remember.
Why are you two talking?
No talking, no cheating.
I won't tolerate any nonsense in my exam room.

I got a 3.87!
What did you get? What did you get?
An easy 4.
Are you free tomorrow? Let's celebrate.
Sure. Where shall we go?
How about Pat's place? It's convenient.
You have a swimsuit, right?
Pat, would it kill you to just get in normally?
I guess not, but it wouldn't be cool.
Damn! I got water in my ear.
Mr. Pat, dinner is served.
Just leave it there.
Babe, I'm getting cold.
PAT
Are you diving to look for coral, Grace?
I have been asking Grace to invite you over many times.
We're in the same class, but we hardly ever talk to each other.
Grace, though...
-She's always, "Lynn this, Lynn that." -Shut up.
Are you jealous?
Grace always tells us that you're so smart.
Without your help, Grace's grades wouldn't have improved.
I have even told her that
I want to have a best friend like you.
I have noticed that you have a lot of close friends.
I do.
But none of them are that close
that they would lend me their erasers during an exam.
What is it?
You also want to appear in the school play?
Smart people like you just don't get it.
But thickheads like me, we're all dying to get good grades.
Right, babe!
Dad said he'll buy me a new car if I pass.
Sounds good?
I know we aren't that close.
But if you agree...
I'll pay you 3,000 per subject.
Per person.
Per person?
What do you mean?
I have five more friends, you see.
Oh? What if the teachers find out?
Don't worry about that.
All of my friends can be trusted.
And they're all willing to pay 3,000 each.
Think about it. That's for one subject.
How many subjects are there in each term, Grace?
If you don't count PE...
Thirteen, right?
So, for just one exam, you'll get 13 times that amount.
That's 234,000 baht.
A nice number, 234,000 baht.
In exchange for your brains.
You can think of it as getting your school's tea money back.
What "tea money"?
Seriously? You really didn't know?
Everyone has to pay.
The dumber you are, the more you have to pay.
I had to pay 400,000.
As for him, he donated 20 iMacs to the school library.
But I got a scholarship.
The scholarship is for studying.
Don't forget your maintenance costs.

DIVORCE AGREEMENT MR. PRAVIT NILTHEP AND MRS. SUJIKARN PHAIBULRUNGROJ
MR. PRAVIT NILTHEP AND MRS. SUJIKARN PHAIBULRUNGROJ
What's gotten into you?
I was going to sell it to buy a new car.
It seems like you haven't played it in ages.
I just remembered that yesterday was Mom's birthday.
Why did you want me to move to this school so badly?
Many students who graduate from this school get scholarships to study overseas.
I wanted to give you better opportunities.
Dad, I'm not like Mom.
Have you ever wondered
if I would have been happier at my old school?
Three points.
Don't make too much noise, okay?
Consider our neighbors. Come and have dinner.
I'm off to bed.
I admit that I paid Lynn.
But paying your friend for music lessons
can't be against the law anywhere, right?
Or can it?
Are you going to send me to an international court?
Have any of you ever heard that classical music can help with the brain's development?
We'll use four songs to represent A, B, C, and D.
Memorize the movements of my fingers.
This is A.
When you memorize it, remember it starts with the pinky and ends with the thumb.
This is B.
B is 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, repeated twice.
This is C.
And this is D.
I'll give you three answers and skip one.
Then, I'll repeat the pattern.
So, it won't be suspicious.
This will keep the marks low enough to stay under the teacher's radar.
Answer the other questions yourselves.
I'll start giving you the answers at 9:15 a.m. Meanwhile, start answering the other questions.

Getting rich from teaching piano?
It's okay to wear new clothes, you know.
At school, they say you're a stingy teacher.
Well, I guess a new pair of pants wouldn't hurt, too.

ACADEMIC YEAR 2013
MR. THANAPHON VIRIYAKUL, ELEVENTH GRADE
ELEVENTH GRADE
BANK
Stay tuned. We'll be back in a moment
with another episode of Teen Genius.
The next team is almost ready.
It's true that Lynn and I study at the same school.
But we're not friends.
Actually, we're rivals.
What's the matter, Bank? Are you nervous?
You had noodles for lunch?
How did you know?
You have some on your shirt.
Your shirt's creased as well.
Here's a baby wipe.
Give it a wipe.
THAI LIFE INSURANCE 5,000 BAHT
Hey! If we win, there's a 5,000 reward!
Actually, we'll get less than that.
It's taxed at 3%, so we lose 150.
So, it's only 4,850, or 2,425 each.
That's still a lot, though.
It's enough for a salmon buffet.
If we really win, will you go out for dinner with me tonight?
No.
I don't like eating out.
It's a waste of money.
What's so funny?
Nothing.
It's just that you sound like my dad.
Is that good or bad?
If it's like Dad, I guess it's good.
Messy hair, wrinkled shirt, you're exactly like him.
What is it? I'm just fixing up your hair.
We'll be on air soon. We have to look good.
You need to look smart.
Are you ready?
The final question.
Tell me the value of pi with as many decimal places as possible.
It's 3.1415926535897932--
That should do it!
The winner of Team Genius this week is...
Krungthep Thaweepanya School!
I'm amazed.
How did you work out the value of pi so quickly?
I didn't work it out. I just memorized it.
Memorized the value of pi?
As a kid, I enjoyed playing memory games with my dad.
The value of pi, names of people and dams.
Very smart indeed.
It's fitting that you're one of our scholarship students.
Come and have a seat.
I didn't ask you to come here just so I could praise you.
I also have some good news to tell you.
The Singapore Embassy is offering scholarships.
They're full scholarships, from bachelor's degrees to doctorates.
In terms of grades, behavior, and determination,
you're the only two who are worthy of being sent to take the scholarship exam.
There's a little problem, though.
This scholarship is only given to one student per school.
But that won't be a problem, right?
I mean, you were teammates yesterday.
But now, you are rivals. Fun, isn't it?
LITTLE BANK LAUNDRY SERVICE
The machine's not working again.
I can't finish the laundry in time.

Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
Your hands are all calloused.
It's understandable that you think I cheated.
But thinking that Bank cheated as well...
Apart from my father,
I have known no one more hardworking and honest than Bank.
Bank!
What's wrong, Tong?
Did you finish studying for the exam?
I'm just like you. I got sick and didn't get through it all.
I'm like you in every way, like I told you.
Then finish studying.
Help me, man. GRADE 11 ROOM 2
Let me copy.
I really can't fail this time.
I tried. But this piano code is too hard.
What piano code?
Nothing. It's nothing.
It's just that I won't copy for free.
I'll pay you for it.
Three thousand. Is that enough?
Let me copy. Your grades won't go down.
Wait! Listen to me. Bank.
Wait for me, Bank.
Bank!
Bank!
Damn it, Bank!
Can't you help a brother out?
Man, you're cruel!

Is it worth it? That was a close call.
Well, it's 3,000 each for 25 people.
What do you think?
Rinrada!
You didn't write your name on the scrap paper.
Miss Rinrada, Class 11/3, and Mr. Banjong, Class 11/1,
please come to the headmistress's office immediately.
I can assure you.
If you don't believe me, have Tong retake the exam.
Then, you'll know the truth.
I have asked the two of you to come here
because Thanaphon says there has been cheating.
There are two sets of papers. It's not worth cheating.
I'll give you the chance to tell me the truth.
Banjong, did you cheat or not?
We'll soon find out.
Thanaphon, Rinrada, you are both excused.
Banjong, you stay here.
Lynn, don't leave just yet.
What are these numbers doing on your worksheet?
They're not the ones from your exam set.
Please don't get caught. Please don't get caught. Please don't get caught.
Everything will be fine.
It's probably about the scholarship.
It's like this. We have evidence that Lynn did the exam paper for her friends.
Lynn.
Tell us why you did this.
If you don't tell me, I'll expel you.
For the money.
It's, well...
Tong tried to hire me to take the exam for him.
For 3,000 baht.
I'm extremely disappointed in you.
Vit.
I accepted your daughter because she was a good student.
But being a good student isn't enough.
She also needs to exhibit good behavior.
You're a teacher, too. You must understand.
Doing the exam for your friend is considered cheating.
It's a serious violation of school rules.
Actually, I could expel you immediately.
But since this is the first time,
I'm just cutting off your free scholarship.
Yes, ma'am.
Can't Tong and Lynn just retake the exam?
Remember, Lynn.
School is a place for studying,
not a place for making money.
What's so funny?
-You have no manners. -No.
That's not it.
Mr. Pravit.
You're a teacher. Didn't you teach her manners?
I'm sorry.
I couldn't have been the only one using the school as a place to make money.
What do you mean by that?
I'm talking about the tea money that my dad paid.
It's not called tea money.
It's called school maintenance fee.
The school maintenance fee.
Isn't it the tuition fee?
Enough, Lynn. Enough.
Please let my daughter continue here.
I will take care of the remaining tuition fee.
Let's go.
Fine.
But there's one condition.
You're banned from the Singapore scholarship.
Let's go.
What's the scholarship got to do with it?
It's true that I helped my friends copy my answers,
but I never copied anyone else's.
All of the results that I have achieved have been the product of my own ability.
Other students have such ability as well.
People like Thanaphon deserve the scholarship more.
If you can't accept this condition, it's better that you leave.
All right, Vit?
Yes, ma'am.
Let's go.
Good luck with the scholarship.
If evidence has been found...
then I guess Lynn may have cheated.
CONGRATULATIONS TO SCHOLARSHIP STUDENTS ACADEMIC YEAR 2013
But I'm not involved.
MISS RINRADA NILTHEP, ELEVENTH GRADE
Both of us being honor students doesn't mean...
MR. THANAPHON VIRIYAKUL
we have the same personality.
MISS RINRADA NILTHEP
Just what I thought.
You definitely wouldn't have done that for merely 3,000 baht.
Piano lessons.
Didn't you ever think that it might have been better to actually teach your friends?
But the headmistress cheated us first, Dad.
How can you call it cheating when I paid willingly?
So did my friends. You still don't see that you did something wrong?
I'll take the blame.
It's my fault
I can't blame anyone else.
If I can't even raise you to be a good person,
how dare I ask other people to pay for your tuition?
I'll sell my car to pay what's left of the tuition fee.
As for this shirt...
I don't want it anymore.
And let's forget about going abroad.
You're not going anywhere anymore.
Stay here with your dad.
Return all of the money to your friends.
No matter how much you all think that Lynn is a bad person...
she's a really good friend of mine.
I'm sorry for being a crybaby...
but I'm not just putting on an act.
TWELFTH GRADE
So, do I look great or not?
Not bad.
Casting is tomorrow.
This isn't all you asked me to come for, right?
How have you all been?
Can you all take care of yourselves for the two terms we have left?
Pat and I have other things to worry about.
Has Pat told you?
We just got back from France.
The trip was a lot of fun.
Yes, because you left me behind.
-Well, it was a shopping spree. -Mom.
I got you something, too--
-Pat. -Yes?
Grab me some red wine from the cellar.
Why don't you get the maid to get it?
Yes, sir.
Grace, would you like some more dessert?
I'm fine, thanks.
We invited you here today because we wanted to thank you.
Thank me for what?
For helping Pat with his studies.
You have no idea
how much we have been stressing out over his grades.
But as soon as you two started dating, Pat has become a whole new person.
What I'm saying is that
you're smarter than all of those famous tutors.
Actually, we have been planning for some time
to send Pat to the same college I went to in Boston.
Judging by his earlier grades,
I know that he definitely won't make it.
So, this is what I'm thinking.
You should go with him, so you can help him with his studies there.
Sounds good?
There's no need to worry about expenses.
Accommodation, food...
We'll take care of it.
As for the tuition fees...
If you are short...
you can always feel free to ask me.
I already have all of the information ready.
Please have a look at it.
If money isn't an issue, say yes, okay?
You know about the STIC exam, right?
It's like the GAT/PAT for entry to US universities.
It's held at the same time around the world.
I need to take the STIC
and I need to take it within this year.
If I don't, I won't be able to apply to the universities in time.
HOW TO BLITZ THE STIC
I have already risked a lot for you, Grace.
It's really hard for me to ask you for help.
But Pat and I really don't know what else to do.
Pat says he's going to hire you for 600,000 baht.
HOW TO BLITZ THE STIC
Excuse me. Could you return this to Pat?
Okay.
Could I borrow a pen and some paper?
I REALLY CAN'T HELP YOU THIS TIME, SORRY!
Miss.
Would you like to reserve a room?
As for time zones,
the STIC is held at the same time and date worldwide.
This means that these countries over here will take the exam earlier than other places.
To put it simply, if both of you take the exam in Thailand,
while I take it somewhere where it's held earlier,
such as in Sydney, Australia, that means four hours earlier than Thailand,
we get to see the exam questions sooner and answer them sooner as well.
I can send the answers back to you and to other people in Thailand, too.
As many as we want.
Using this method,
not only will I be helping you
get a passing score to get into a university,
I'll be getting revenue from other customers as well.
After deducting expenses, we can split the profits.
Isn't it too risky?
Risky? Not at all.
Who is this?
It's Teacher Lynn, babe.
This is the only way
for me to have enough money to go and study with you
without having to ask anyone for help.
Oh, I forgot to mention.
I'm going to Boston with both of you as well.
It will be so much fun to go together!
You two will be responsible for finding customers for me.
As for the exam itself, I'll take care of it.
Wait a minute.
Before we get to the part about customers,
I get the time zone thing,
but I'm still confused.
How are you going to get the answers out of the exam room?
Secretly write them down?
Memorize them.
Memorizing them is the best way.
It's the safest.
And it leaves no trace.
I'm sorry.
Are you one of the X-Men?
The STIC has more than 100 questions.
Can you remember all of them?
Yes, I can.
If I have enough time.
However, after I'm done with the questions, there's not much time left.
The best I can do is remember half of the questions.
Only half?
There's one person who could help.
But he won't.
What's up, Mom?
Yes, I'm done.
Mr. Rut's house?
Can't it wait until another day? Tomorrow?
I have my scholarship exam at 8:00 a.m.
Okay.
Hey, you!
Your basket grazed my mirror!
If you had said sorry--
That hurts...
It's 250,000 for a passing score.
It's not that much money for you, is it?
The tutoring fee for the STIC is way more expensive.
Let's think about it.
We need to try and find 30 customers.
More than this and it will be risky.
Any less and it won't be worth it either.
I have almost 30 people in my STIC group chat already.
If you can ask your friends there to join, I'll knock 5,000 off the original fee that you're supposed to pay me.
But wait.
You must make sure no one knows about this.
Especially that loser, Bank.
Hey, no need to worry about that dumbass.
He won't tell anyone.
Why not?
Didn't you hear?
The dumbass got beaten up.
He's in the hospital.
The best part is he didn't make it to the scholarship exam.
SEMINAR: EXCELLING IN EDUCATION
I believe that everyone here wants to pass the STIC
to turn their dreams into reality.
That's Steve Pat.
I have a way for everyone to obtain satisfactory scores.
All you can take into the exam room
is a 2B pencil, an eraser.
Your exam ID...
And your passport.
Communication devices are strictly prohibited.
So, I'll hide the phone with the answers
to be sent back to Thailand in a cistern in the exam room toilets.
I'll send the answers back during the breaks.
The exam is divided into three sessions, with two breaks.
Wait. Just a second.
How do the customers get the answers into the exam room?
Not everyone can memorize all the answers like you.
Barcode.
Everyone will receive a 2B pencil with a barcode on it.
The different widths of the lines in each barcode will represent a different answer.
From left to right.
Starting with the thickest line, which stands for A, then B, C, and D.
Sounds cool, right?
But the fun doesn't stop there.
There are four pencils.
One pencil for one section.
And these numbers next to the barcode are for the grid-in questions.
GRID-IN ANSWERS
For the essay, they use already-published material.
I'll send keywords, so you can Google them.
-That's mine. -I'm not giving it to you.
-It fell. -Hey!
I'm telling you how to do this, but you'll have to write the answers yourselves.
To summarize, on the exam day,
everyone has to leave the meeting point by 7:30 a.m.
in order to reach the exam rooms in time.
We'll provide a motorbike to take each person to their exam venue.
Finally, everyone has to pay in cash within the next two weeks.
Otherwise, the deal is off.
One other thing I need to emphasize is that...
what we are about to do together must be kept secret.
Does anyone have any issues?
If not, we'll end the seminar now.
We will unite
in our educational quest
to obtain scores that will allow us entry to any college.
We need to be able to choose our school, not let it decide whether or not we can study there.
Hey, that's rough, Bank.
What's up?
I was sorry to hear about it.
That you weren't able to take the scholarship exam.
Same here.
What happened that day...
I didn't mean it. Really.
I wouldn't know whether you meant it or not.
What I do know is that you're responsible for what happened to me as well.
I have a proposition for you.
What is it?
It involves taking an exam.
Taking an exam or cheating in an exam?
For me, using the word "cheating" means someone loses something.
But here, we'll make money and others pass exams.
Everyone wins.
Bank.
We are both losers, actually.
We weren't born winners like Pat and Grace.
We have to try harder than other people to get what we deserve.
Look at what happened.
We're not the same.
You cheated.
But I was just unlucky.
True.
But don't you see that even if you don't cheat,
life cheats you anyway.
This is Grace's home address.
See you tomorrow if you're interested.

Sit down here.
Hey.
You're not going to sit?
This is what's going to happen.
First, you and I fly to Sydney, Australia and take the STIC together.
Hey, Lynn.
You're missing one document.
Dad, that Teen Genius show that I was in,
they want me to appear in it again, in Sydney.
BY THAI LIFE INSURANCE
They need your bank statement for my visa.
Who are you going with?
I'm going with Bank.
It's not just us. Our teacher is going too.
Secondly,
you and I will each have to memorize half of the exam questions.
Don't forget.
Bank memorizes the first half, and Lynn the second half.
Section 1 has 52 questions.
Start.
52 QUESTIONS
44 QUESTIONS
16 GRID-IN QUESTIONS
For the final section,
you need to leave the exam room before the end
to send the essay question in time.
Time's up for Section Four. Start the essay question.
It shouldn't be hard for you to remember the title.
The hard part is that they won't let you leave early.
To avoid any suspicion,
you will have to act sick.
Sure.
I can throw up.
So, do I have to puke now?
-No. -No! You don't.
Go now.
So, how much is my cut?
One million.
How much is yours?
Two million.
What do you say, Bank?
Everything is in your hands.
TOILET
Got it!
In time.
You should have just said yes from the start.
Hey, guys!
See you tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.
Have you lost it?
Doesn't the plane leave at 11:00 p.m.?
What's the rush?
There's one more thing we need to rehearse.
That's enough.
You can't keep on grilling someone who's innocent!
You're enjoying this, aren't you?
Watching an innocent man's tears stream down like this.
That's way too much, Pat. Way too much.
I have used up all my cards.
You guys are acting like we have really been caught.
I get it already.
If you get caught, we'll let you be the fall guy.
Last question before heading to the airport.
The last question.
Ready?
What if Bank gets caught?
What will you say?
That has even less to do with me. I have never even been his friend.
I have seen him at school for the last four or five years.
I haven't noticed him having even one friend.
He looks like a douchebag too.
And he's a weirdo.
He even got beaten up outside the school
and ended up on a scrap heap.
So, are we done?
Stop!
Calm down, Bank!
Bank, stop!
I told you to stop!
Dumbass!
-Stop it! -You motherfucker!
What the hell are you doing?
You were the one who told me to say this.
So, why are you mad at me?
Pat! Stop!
Bank. Bank, stop!
What is it? What?
-I... -You... What, then?
I never told anyone that I once woke up on a scrap heap!
Now, do you know what I'm angry about?
All of you set this up, didn't you?
Set it up so I couldn't take the scholarship exam!
All of you were in on it, right?
You guys knew, right?
Right?
You knew, right?
Why aren't you dumbasses answering me?
Bank! Cool it, man!
I don't want to hear any more from you again!
Bank, give it a break. Let's talk about this.
Let's talk about it, Bank!
You're okay now, right?
I'm sorry, Bank.
Bank.
I'm really sorry, Bank. I'm really sorry.
I didn't know they were going to go that far.
Bank, just listen to me first.
You're still going to take the STIC, aren't you? Bank.
-I'm begging you. -That damn STIC!
Bank, listen to me first, Bank.
I'm listening to you!
It's just me and my mom at my place.
She's like a hunchback, doing the laundry.
I'm not rich like you!
It was my dream to get a scholarship,
to help my mother have a comfortable life.
Damn you!
Bank. If you don't take the STIC, my dad will kill me.
Please, Bank.
We both win, don't you see?
Bank, I'm begging you.
In that case...
send those thugs to beat up your dad!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Wasn't it you who told me that you needed him?
So, if I don't play dirty, do you think he'll agree to help you?
Lynn!
Let's talk first.
You were in on this too, weren't you?
I didn't have a clue.
Please try to understand Pat.
He did it because he wanted to help you with your plan.
Without any consideration about who might get hurt?
THE FUTURE OF LAUNDRY
Grace, return everyone's money.
I'm pulling out.
Wait, Lynn.
Calm down.
If that's how it is, I respect your decision.
You don't have to do it.
No more clients, okay?
Just the three of us. The original plan.
Don't you understand?
When I said no, I meant no.
Okay.
It's up to you, then.
I only have one request.
Don't be mad at me.
If I had half of your brain, I wouldn't do anything this stupid.
Please?
The plane is leaving in three hours.
Let's go, Lynn.
Bank.
I'll go through with it.
At least there's money in it.
I won't get beaten up for nothing.
What if I told you that... I didn't want to do it anymore?
I'm not begging you.
I'm here, thanks to you.
I slept on a scrap heap, thanks to you as well.
All of this shit is happening because of you.
Don't you think you're responsible for this, too?
SYDNEY
Here. Your phone.
Lynn.
I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?
Well...

Don't we have to leave here before 7:30 a.m.?
Yes.
-It's almost 7:00 now. -How long do we have to wait?
I'm supposed to get more than this.
I have already paid you.
Hey, it's past 7:00 a.m. already. Why aren't they sending the other answers?
I don't know!
-Good morning. -Good morning.
Is Lynn here? I can't contact her.
I haven't seen her.
Lynn told me that she was going to Sydney for a competition.
No wonder I haven't seen her.
I'm sure she'll bring back a medal.
But I found this permission letter that I had signed at the house.
When I called the show, no one answered.
So, I came to this address.
Can someone tell me why Lynn is in Sydney?
If the two of you don't answer, I'll go and tell the headmistress.
Tell me now what you're up to!
NEXT
Lynn and Bank are dating!
They went on a secret trip together.
Lynn thought you wouldn't let her go, so she lied.
I didn't know how to stop her.
I think it would be best
if you go back and talk with your daughter in person.
Come on!
Sir.
Love is a beautiful thing.
Shit!
What's up?
It's 7:00 a.m. already. The motorbikes are leaving.
They're saying it's past the time they agreed on.
Explain to me first what's wrong.
I don't know anything!
I'll speak to them myself.
What's wrong with your leg?
It's 7:30 a.m. already.
-What's up? -Where are the barcodes?
-I already paid you. -You said it will be okay.
-You'll get it soon. -We'll be late!
Hey, you'll make it. I promise.
Pat! We ran out of stickers!
Here you go, 500 baht each. Just a minute. Chill. Thanks.
Shit!
Hey! Please open the door!
Can you open the door, please?
Come on!
Grace, it's almost 7:30 a.m. Do we have all the answers?
Not yet. There are still six to go.
Why does it say "Edge"?
It says "Edge."
What's Edge?
There's no signal.
What happens if we don't make it? And the money that we paid?
If we don't make it, we want our money back!
-Come on! -Have we got them yet?
These three bikes, go to the Bang Kapi venue.
These two rows, head to Sutthisan.
Are you on your bikes? Put on your helmets! Quickly!
Take one set each.

Okay, we're all set! Helmets! Quickly!
Helmets, quickly! Put them on and go!
Let's go!
I'm from the embassy.
A Thai student has confessed using his phone's dictionary.
We're dealing with it.
What will happen to him?
They'll probably cancel his result.
Worst case, they'll ban him permanently from the STIC.
As for the others,
they'll let them go if they don't find anything.
Wait here first. I'll take care of things.
They have been investigating for two or three days.
Just a moment.
What's the matter?
I need to use the bathroom, sorry.
Of course.
Lynn!
It's Lynn FC!
TEACHER LYNN FC
Thank you, Lynn!
We're throwing a party for you at our place tonight.
What are we celebrating?
Bank got caught.
And I had my result canceled, Pat.
Well, we'll find another exam venue for you, won't we?
If you don't retake the exam, you won't be able to apply to a university in time.
Hey, Lynn!
Lynn, you have to apply to retake the exam.
Please, Lynn. Pretty please?
I have changed my mind already.
Both of you already have the results you needed.
But we can't go and study without you.
Don't you both know...
that university exams aren't multiple-choice?
Even if I went and studied with you,
you wouldn't be able to copy my answers.
I'll find my own ride.
ARRIVALS
Where's your boyfriend?
Where is he?
I wanted to invite him for dinner.
Where is he?
Why didn't you tell me about your boyfriend?
-Dad... -What?
I have something to confess to you.
What is it, honey?
Tell me.
Why did you choose to study Education?
I would like to be a teacher like my father,
so others can benefit the most from my knowledge.
So, do you have any previous experience in tutoring others?
Have you ever taught anyone before?
Yes, I have.
I SCORED 1,460 IN THE STIC
Being a teacher isn't just about being smart in academics.
Do you think that
you can set a good example in other ways too?
GRACE: LYNN, WHEN ARE YOU COMING?
PAT: BANK HAS TAKEN HIS SHARE. COME AND GET YOURS.
I'm not going to lie.
GRACE: HURRY UP. I MISS YOU.
I have done a lot of bad things in the past.
But I will learn from them for my own benefit and for others.
LYNN LEFT THE CHAT
But it's such a waste.
To be honest, with this much knowledge and ability,
you could have gotten a scholarship and gone abroad to study.
Haven't you considered this?
I think that...
there are others who deserve a scholarship more than me.
STUDENT EXPULSION LETTER: THANAPHON VIRIYAKUL
CONGRATULATIONS TO SCHOLARSHIP STUDENTS MR. THANAPHON VIRIYAKUL, ELEVENTH GRADE
MISS RINRADA NILTHEP, ELEVENTH GRADE
BANK: COME OVER TO MY PLACE TONIGHT
Come in.
The store looks nice and fresh, Little Bank.
I'm sorry. It's Mr. Bank now.
Are you laundering money?
You were expelled from school because the embassy reported you, right?
So, what's next?
That's the reason I asked you over.
Did you apply for the GAT/PAT exams?
I have a proposition for you.
GAT/PAT INTENSIVE TUTORING BY BANK EVERY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY
I have a foolproof plan.
Much safer.
We can get the answers out to more people.
More importantly, there are more customers for the GAT/PAT than for the STIC.
But this plan requires...
Teacher Lynn's assistance.
How much more money do you need?
If your cut isn't sufficient...
you can get mine from Pat.
Go and get it.
No. Wait a minute.
It's not about whether it's enough or not.
It's about how much more we can make...
in the future.
Lynn.
I have done the calculations.
This time,
there's at least ten million in it.
For that much money, don't you think that it's worth the risk again?
You see it, right?
That even if we get caught, that wouldn't mean jail.
Actually, Lynn,
are you going to study for four more years for a five-figure salary
when we could have millions by then?
Why settle for a stupid desk job?
Because for me right now, no amount of money is worth it.
Lynn.
If you won't do this...
I'll tell everyone that you were the mastermind behind the STIC scandal.
I guarantee that you'll end up being banned from studying abroad, just like me.
Fine.
We're even, then.
It won't just be you.
It will also be Grace, Pat.
And all the customers who took the STIC that time will be caught up as well.
Think about it, Lynn.
If they find out about it, they'll cancel all of the scores in the country.
On top of that...
your father will be devastated, too.
Don't be afraid, honey.
We'll get through this somehow.
Smile, honey. Smile.
Smile like your dad.
Miss Rinrada?
You once told me, didn't you...
that if we win, we would win together.
If we go down, we would go right down together.
I won't be the only one taking all the blame again.
If you don't do it, I'll make sure you go down with me.
What do you say, Lynn?
What's it going to be?
Everything is up to you now.
DJ CINDERELLA
That's me, living my dream.
To be a successful DJ at a nightclub!
Cíntia, wake up! Wake up, Cíntia!
And this is Patrícia. Once again, messing with my dreams.
Cíntia, wake up!
Sleeping in your parents' party? What will people think?
That you're a fake who's trying to destroy my family's happiness!
That's what I should have said.
But since I had no idea what was going to happen, I said:
you're right, Patrícia, sweetheart, I'll go mingle.
Life in my house was always a party.
Those two are my parents.
So beautiful and loving!
In my family, everyone believed in love.
-Men are a disgrace! -What is it, aunt?
Rafa got jealous because I talked to the waiter!
-Come on! -Except for aunt Helena.
-Is it Rafa who pays my bills? -But isn't it, aunt?
At this stage, it actually is.
But only until I become the star of Brazilian poetry.
-Come on, aunt... -No one's buying my freedom!
You know what? I'll get some juice, because I'm not obligated to anyone!
-Wow, Cíntia! You look beautiful! -Looking like a princess.
And you look like two hags from a horror movie.
I'd love to have said that to Patrícia's hypocrite daughters.
But I said:
you look beautiful, too.
-Sorry! -Sorry!
Look, Rafa! It's a piano piece I want to surprise my parents with.
Is this yours?
-It will spice up the couple's song. -That's the idea, right?
-Do you think they'll like it? -That's cool, Cíntia.
You always do well. Go get them!
Rafa is a piece of work.
He and aunt Helena are a case of opposites that form a perfect pair.
But people say love is like this: when it hits, it hits.
Ouch!
That's me, Freddy Prince.
And now I'm going to tell my version of this party.
Bonjour, beautiful!
Today the Belinha's channel will enter the Dorella family mansion
to see how the rich have fun.
How they dance, how they dress, what they eat!
Let's find out now. Come with me!
All right, Bê. You can't complain about your friend here.
Now let's go back. I have to play.
If I were you, I'd give up on the quartet and focus on my own music.
Classical music only works in Germany.
In Germany and at this party, because they pay well!
The money goes to recording my music, Bê.
-Sell-out! -And there's more!
If I hadn't come, who'd have got you in?
Now you have exclusive content for your half a dozen followers!
One day I'll explode and you'll beg me
to give props to your music on my channel.
I'll think about playing in your little channel, alright?
Keep dreaming!
Before I go play, I'll change the sneakers
because the client demanded dress shoes.
I think they're in my bag. I don't know.
Relax, we got time! Let's see if we find someone interesting!
-I'm here for work, Bê. -You only think of work!
You stay home all day, writing songs about perfect love.
"Where will my princess be?"
Find a flesh and bones princess to know the real thing.
I see nothing here that fits me, Bê, look at that!
Yeah. It's going to be tough here.
-Sorry! -Sorry!
There, the quartet guys are back. Go play, and I'll film the place.
Is the break over?
What are we jamming now?
I'm jamming you out of here if you don't wear proper shoes.
Come on boy, go! Get them out now.
No, I won't.
You don't own the house. You're an employee.
Right? You stuck-up secretary. You don't write the rules.
And you're also very rude.
I'd have said that if I knew who in fact she was.
-Go, boy! Take them off! -Alright, of course!
I'd better be smart and obey, right?
Exactly. Robson, stand here now.
So...
I left my shoe at home.
We have a problem.
We have a problem? You have a problem.
Look around, my dear. See what's going on?
-It's a party for classy people, get it? -No, I don't.
People like me, classy, fine, elegant.
-Rude? -No, honest.
Which may sound the same, right? Depending on the situation.
And this is your situation:
get a decent shoe or get out.
Alright, but give me back my sneakers.
Lost your tone, musician? Now you want your sneakers?
Catch! Go get it!
-Oh, my God! Cíntia! -Ouch!
Oh, my God! Are you alright?
-Are you fine? Does it hurt? -No, it's fine.
It was this stupid musician who's wearing this garbage.
-I'm expelling him... -Don't be silly, Patrícia, let him play!
What is the problem?
Annoying girl. How long will I have to put up with her?
Me too, mom! How long? She has everything I don't:
more clothes, more shoes, more bags...
-The only thing I have more than her... -It's envy!
-It's something, right? -Easy! Calm down, momma's cubs.
This game will turn, the story will change.
What story? On Instagram?
What is it, guys? It could be on Facebook!
-I don't know. -Look, it's going to start.
Oh, this is very good!
César!
César!
Come, love.
What got into you?
-Sorry, dad, it was a surprise. -Daughter...
-I thought you'd like it. -That was Beethoven.
-And you messed it up adding... whatever. -Easy, César!
-You've embarrassed me! -Dad!
-Easy! -You nailed it.
She had it coming!
If only I had a powerful father like that...
Do you want the royal life that fool takes for granted?
Do you? Come with me.
No, you stay, I didn't call you. Let's go.
Got it, Graziele? Now go. Go hide.
César!
What a shame!
An important man like you doesn't deserve this.
But I'm here, my love.
I'm here, whatever happens. -Always here. -I didn't want this party,
-you know it. -I know.
Ana insisted so much!
-I'm not complaining, am I? -No.
I'm not saying: "Ditch your wife, give me a good life, give my girls a dad,
be a man and realize that I'm the one for you, you moron."
Am I saying that?
Of course not, my love, you're an angel. You'd never say that.
Never, your love is enough for me.
Don't mind your dad. You know how he is, don't you?
-Your father is traditional. -He's wrong, Ana. And so are you.
Giving up on your career for this fossil.
-Helena! -He's your dinosaur!
He's my love. Do you know what love is?
For love, you give up on some things.
And, to this day, I don't regret having married César!
César...
Till this day, right?
And that's when I stopped believing in love.
I learned from my mother that we have to look to the future.
Two years after leaving my father's house,
we felt that nothing could limit our dreams.
I'm glad you arrived on time, my love.
I thought you weren't coming.
-Of course I came, mom. -I'll miss you so much!
And, your crazy aunt! After all, I stayed here for a long time.
Two years, right? Two years aren't two days.
I got used to having you here, sis.
It's an unique opportunity, you know?
-I know. -You worked hard for the scholarship.
-Archaeology has always been your passion. -Since childhood!
She dug bones from the garden and said it was a mummy.
Then grandma would say: "This is a chicken bone, you menace!"
Look what a beautiful family I got!
He acts like he's married to me.
What are you saying, my partner?
I'll be fine, mom, I promise.
Go after your dreams and I'll go after mine.
-Studying music in London. -You'll succeed,
-I know you will. -Cíntia will be a star.
-I believe in her future. -Me too.
-Travel safely. -Take care of her.
-Trust me. -Thanks.
-Bye, mom. -Bye, my love. Take care.
-Bye, mom. -Bye, my love. Take care. -You too. -I love you so much!

THE KING OF ROMANTIC BALLADS OF THE INTERNET
Did you remember Cat?
What cat? There is no cat here! Are you crazy?
The little mouse, girl. You have to feed him.
That Cat? Who would name a mouse "Cat"?
I named it Cat because of the guy who gave it to me.
The guy was a stray.
You and your boyfriends, aunt.
By the way, wasn't it this cat who disappeared?
No! That was Dog.
He gave me this cat.
-Then, in his memory... -You named the cat "Dog".
This one was given to me by an ex
who wasn't worth a rotten tomato. Did I tell you that story?
If the parakeet is called "Chicken", you don't need to tell.
Cíntia, the truth is this:
animals are noble except for men, they're all strays.
That's why my motto is: pick them up, but don't cling to them.
That goes for Rafa too.
Hi, love. Did you say something?
"Don't cling" and here you are, together for two years.
-Imagine if you clung. -Alright, Cíntia, quit the crap.
I want to know what you think of my newest concrete poetry.
-Let me hear it. -Attention!
"The mass, the carcass,
the bagasse, the lass and the class,
the boat and the goat,
that squeezes my throat,
mine, ours, yours, the turtle's hole!"
What's up?
-Do turtles have holes, aunt? -No, it's not in that sense.
-It's where it lives, the turtle's hole. -Got it.
-It's very concrete, isn't it? -You were amazing, my love!
I think you're amazing. Let me kiss you, my softie.
Softie, Rafa? Have mercy!
Hold on, Helena!
-What did I do? -You were soft.
Soft and concrete. You see, right?
-Each one has a talent, right? -Never mind, she's silly.
In fact, how about we take this time to practice with your music?
-Let's practice! -Let's go!
Alright. Go.
Always keep the pace.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
It goes up and then you go down and then you pull out.
Look at the bass.
Now eight more.
Lower the bass.
Good!
Very good! You're doing great!
If you keep this up and get good grades in school,
you'll get that scholarship in London.
Rafa, you could let her play in some parties,
-to get some practice. -I promise I'll try.
Don't be all over me, alright? I need some air.
Cíntia, I'm coming. Let's go to class.
Lara, I wish I could skip class to stay here learning from Rafa.
Yeah, but I can't. I have to go, Cíntia.
-We'll practice more later. -Stay a little longer
to hear more of my concrete poetry.
-Lara, wait for me, I'm going. -No! Wait! "The green!
The plants! Photosynthesis! One, two, three, four..."
Good morning. Hi!
-Hi, girl. Let's go? -Let's go.
Cycling is good for fat people, right?
Better than going to the gym just to post pictures!
-Ignore it. -Come on, Graziele.
-Leave it alone. -But she teased me, mom!
Against facts there are no arguments!
-Less, Gisele. -Less what, mom?
In your case, less weight would help, alright?
-Mom, come on! -Truth hurts but strengthens!
Get out, you two, out of the car!
-Go, Graziele. -Go!
So you know who's going to play on my birthday?
Our birthday, Graziele! We're twins.
Same mother, but not the same father.
How come, if we're twins?
Gisele, my angel, there must be a genetic explanation
for me to be like this and you... -like that. -What?
Leave me alone, girl! Let me tell the news, please?
Do you know who'll play on my birthday?
-Who? -Go away, you won't be invited.
Freddy Prince!
In flesh and bone, rhythm and poetry!
After I started putting my songs on the internet,
I discovered that there's still people wanting to talk about love.
Soon I started to receive show proposals,
record label contracts and even an international tour.
-Your fans will go nuts, it's perfect. -Yeah, it got better but...
something's missing.
You should go out more, see some people.
You have to enjoy success a bit, Freddy.
You only talk about love, but you have to stop idealizing it and...
start living! Get a girlfriend!
What boyfriend, mom? I want to go after my dreams.
Alright, my love. Now let me tell you something.
We've found remnants from the mummy of a queen
miles from the mummy of a king. Can you believe it?
See? Even mummies keep men away.
And speaking of mummies, can you believe daddy put both of Patrícia's girls in my school?
They even have the guts to call him dad
in front of everyone. Seriously, mom!
Daughter, mom can't talk now, I have to go.
Now take care, my love.
-I love you, alright? -I miss you. I love you.
Hi! Did you know Freddy Prince will give an exclusive show
-at my birthday party? -Really?
So? I don't like his music!
-She doesn't like it! -She doesn't like it!
-Right! -But this is great,
because now you have an excuse not to go, right?
After all, it was daddy who invited you. If it depended on me, you wouldn't go.
Like I'm leaving my house to see Freddy Prince and his cheeky songs.
I like Freddy's music. His lyrics are so beautiful!
I wish André said those things to me!
Boring lyrics. "I'll greet the sea,
my heart is high, love at first sight."
For someone who doesn't like, you know them well. Right?
Of course, I don't criticize without knowing.
I heard the songs that's why I know they are awful.
-Hi, Cíntia. Are you all right, cutie? -Hi, boys!
I was talking to Cíntia about seeing a movie.
-Let's go, André? -You didn't say that!
Lara, your shot's gone. I'm sorry, all right?
Have you seen the app we invented? More like I invented it. The Vibracheat.
-What is it? -An app for cheating on tests.
It's easy, look! A long vibration is the question number.
And short vibrations are the answers, like A, B, C, D.
-Nice, right? -No, it's easier to study, isn't it?
For those who like it. Come on, Diego.
That way the guy will give up on you.
He should, with that stupid app.
You need therapy, do you know that?
"My parents divorced, I'm traumatized, nobody cares, blah, blah, blah..."
The worse was you calling André out of nowhere to go out.
-Lara, he doesn't like you. -If you say so!
I know he loves me. He even promised to marry me.
Yeah, when you were seven, right?
So what? Children are honest.
And I'm the one who needs therapy. Bye.
Cíntia! Run, Cíntia!
Come here, girl. Rafa wants you to play at a party now!
Now? In the afternoon?
So what? It must be a crazy pool party.
Prepare the set today! We'll rock it with your music at the club!
Aunty, define a crazy pool party.
Rafa will pay for this!
But look on the bright side, you're here forming an audience.
I'll get you some snacks.
Phonograph lady, can you lower the sound a bit?
I can't hear anything.
-I'm sorry, ma'am, if I lower... -What?
If I lower it a bit more, nobody will be able to hear the music.
I'll complain to the party host. What's your name again?
-Cíntia Dorella. -Cinderella?
Yeah! It's DJ Cinderella.
What a piece of work! Cinderella!
DJ Cinderella.
Beautiful, wonderful, a spectacle!
-Am I beautiful, mom? -I was talking about myself.
Wow, I look amazing!
-Gisele, my dear, do you like this mask? -Pretty, right?
Wear it, to hide your ugliness.
Graziele, don't mess with your sister, or you'll look even uglier.
Sorry, I didn't mean that!
-No, mom. You're forgiven. -I was apologizing to Graziele.
-Mom! -Darling, inner beauty also counts.
-And, on the inside, you're full of... -Fat.
Values.
Your inner values are heavy, I mean, they count a lot.
-I have a normal weight, mother! -Anyone can do normal, Gisele.
What sets us apart, daughter? Beauty.
Being beautiful inside also counts,
but outside a few less kilos would help a big deal, you know?
-I don't agree. -Darling, truth hurts but strengthens.
-Stop laughing. -Accept that you're fat!
-I'm not fat. -Yes, you are!
Hey!
Dear sister, you look so beautiful!
You look lovely. And mom?
-Mom looks like an angel! -Mom looks like an angel!
My babies!
You know that mom is an Amelia, right? No vanity at all.
César, I didn't see you there!
What beautiful women! True court ladies.
Court dance is the theme of the party. How do we look?
Beautiful. I wish Cíntia were like you!
-Beautiful? -No, my love, she's beautiful.
I wish she were this sweet and affectionate.
Let's talk about good things. The girls want to thank you
for hiring Freddy Prince to play on their fifteenth birthday party.
It's alright. You're his fans, aren't you?
-Just look at this. -Look.
Look at that!
Does Cíntia like this Freddy Prince?
-That one doesn't like anyone. -What is it, my love?
The boy conquers anyone, right? Look how pretty he is.
I hope so. Now, will you excuse me? Dad's going to travel...
Already? No, my love! I'm going to miss you so much!
Goodbye!
It took so long this time!
So much to solve for the party!
Mom, Freddy has to love the party!
Love! Because I love him and I want to marry him.
You and Freddy? How crazy! This is impossible.
Impossible is a place which doesn't exist, child.
It's "far away is a place which doesn't exist", mom.
But you get it, right?
What mom meant was that there are no barriers to our dreams, right?
Look at mom's example.
Mom was a very poor girl.
Mom had to work hard to get things, see?
To win the Miss Pool contest, I had to forge the result.
Mom always finds a way!
The test to work at the firm: mom stole the answers
and got first place.
Mom always finds a way!
Even to conquer César, what did mom have to do?
Should we answer that?
To find a way! Mom always finds a way.
Mom, I want to be like you and do whatever it takes to catch Freddy.
Is that what you want? So that's what you'll get.
You just need to focus!
-And what do I need, mom? -To lose weight.
Mom, I don't. I already told you, I'm normal.
Darling, listen to your mother.
Normal people hate themselves, my dear. I'll schedule you therapy. You need it.
Were those three or four short vibrations?
Two short ones and a long one, I think.
Or a short one and two long ones?
You've abused the confidence of the school.
Using the cell phone to cheat. That is fraud.
From now on, It's forbidden to use cell phones at school.
What? What about my mother? How absurd!
Your parents have the school number for any emergency.
Yes, Cíntia.
-During recess, will we be able to use it? -No.
Recess is for your socialization.
Talk to each other.
It's all your fault, morons.
"Calm down"? How am I going to talk to my mother now?
It had to be during recess because of Japan's time zone.
It's twelve hours apart!
Yeah, looks like you're screwed.
But look, talk to your father, he's important.
Wasn't it his company that donated all the computers?
I didn't want this!
But friend, it's for a good cause. They can't ban cell phones!
Look at André, he must be devastated!
Lara, forget this boy. You deserve better.
-He doesn't care about you. -Girl, it's love, what can I do?
Have a little more self-love.
That's why I don't fall in love. I don't want to look like you.
Rafa, how are you?
It's all cool.
Look, they called me for a last-minute trip.
Can you cover a party for me?
-For real? -I'm serious, for real.
But this time it's a cool party.
Good money, professional equipment, laser harp...
You'll only play until midnight. No problem being under age.
Of course I'll do it! Where will you play?
I'm going to play in a rave in Recife!
-Are you kidding? How awesome! -Cool, for real!
So, are you ready?
You can trust me, Rafa. I'm super ready.
I want to see that. Cool. I'll text you the address, alright?
Cool.
Hi, Domingos!
Girl, Rafa called me to play at a party.
There will be a lot of people, laser harp.
I don't know, he'll text me later.
But, girl, I'm super anxious.
Scared? Me? Of playing? Am I a woman who gets scared, Lara?
What is it, girl?
Aunt...
It's my costume for today's presentation. Is it that ugly?
Yeah, it's not ugly, but... What presentation is it?
I'll perform with a group of Bolivians who loved my texts.
Did they understand them?
-I didn't get the question. -Forget it.
Where will this thing be?
So, a super nice place, a clandestine casino!
Aunt!
Casinos are forbidden, the law says so.
It's forbidden to forbid, Caetano says so.
What's up? Isn't it amazing? I amaze myself!
DAD
-Cíntia? -Who else could it be, father?
It's been difficult to talk to you lately, darling.
-Hi, honey? Are you there? -Yes. What do you want?
I want to confirm your presence at the twins party.
My love, not everything is simple. Dad knows he screwed up.
I don't want to talk about it.
Dad, I have a problem.
What problem, daughter?
They banned cell phones at school.
It makes sense, I think it's great.
It may be great for you, but for me it's awful.
How will I talk to my mother in Japan?
Well, I can solve this for you,
just as you can go to Gisele and Graziele's party.
I sent you the invitation. Did you get it?
FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY PARTY
Then you said no to your father? I can't believe!
That's right. Imagine that! Blackmailed by my own father now.
That's all I need.
But, anyway, I can't even go to this party. I'm playing at another one.
Hi! My name should be on the service list, I'm the DJ.
Cíntia!
Dad?
My daughter.
My love!
Daughter, I'm glad you decided to come to your sisters' party.
I'm serious. Right, girls?
And why aren't you wearing a costume?
I didn't know it was a matter of obligation.
Obligation? Never!
Consideration maybe, but that's silly. What matters is that you came.
Right, girls?
Exactly!
Come here. I'll help you. Come on.
How could I know it was the same party?
By comparing the addresses. Right, dummy?
I didn't notice, I wasn't even coming to this party.
-If my dad sees me as a DJ, he'll kill me. -How will you play without being seen?
So... I had an idea, but I need your help.
Daughter, where were you, my love?
Me? Walking around, seeing the party. It's very nice.
Oh no! The DJ hasn't come yet.
I want music when Freddy Prince arrives.
Calm down, she must be late, that's all.
She? Is the DJ a woman? I don't know, that's what I heard.
Where?
No need to explain, I've figured it all out.
The DJ company that the house hired belongs to her aunt's boyfriend.
The irresponsible Rafael.
-I'll call him. -Yes, my love.
Freddy! Freddy Prince has arrived!
Freddy!
Freddy! I'm the birthday girl!
-We are! -But I'm more.
And I'm Patrícia, mother of the twins.
I'm such a fan!
-We are! -But I'm more!
Get out, girl!
Sorry, have we already met?
Hardly. I'm too remarkable for you to doubt.
Well, I've been Miss Pool 2004! Was that the occasion?
-I think not. -I'm a very important woman, you know?
Very commented, photographed, seen in a thousand places.
I'll take you to the dressing room.
Aunt, where are you? I need to play!
Aunt!
-You crazy! Why didn't you use the door? -I wasn't invited. Oh! My spine!
Why didn't you give my name?
Would the doorman believe, I'm 17 like César's daughter, Cíntia?
If you were 18, maybe...
-Alright, aunt! Did you bring everything? -I did, it's all here.
And... this is it!
-Now, your new sneakers! -How beautiful!
Because you're here to rock it, right?
The main thing.
Can you recognize me?
If no one recognizes Superman in glasses, no one will recognize you!
César, César, the DJ has arrived.
That's good! Because I couldn't reach that moron Rafael.
-Just out of area. -And talking about morons...
Helena! You came with Cíntia, my dear! What's new?
New? Just your cute attitude, chubby.
Helena, I want to talk to you.
-About my daughter. -Later, César!
-Now let the girl shine! -Shine where?
At the party, right? "Shine where?"
Guys, what a wonderful DJ, right?
Mom, the DJ has to play a Freddy Prince song, right?
-In homage to him. -He's there, it'll be cute.
You're right, girls. I'm going to talk to her.
DJ! Play a Freddy Prince song.
Freddy Prince, my dear, play one of his songs.
Oh, do I need all this?
You do, little cute prince.
Do you hear that, Bê?
All right, Freddy. Let me finish this?
-Who's playing? -I don't know.
-I'll go and see. -Are you crazy?
If you go like this, the girls will attack you.
Put the mask on. Nobody will recognize you there.
What is this DJ doing to Freddy's song?
Freddy's going to hate it. What a stupid DJ!
Patrícia!
Mom, look at what the DJ did to my future husband's music!
-My future husband! -Watch yourself, girl.
Freddy will think it was my idea. My life is over!
What happened to this DJ?
Your costume is so different.
They're all dressed as princesses and you're queen of hearts!
Thanks!
I like your sneakers!
-Dude, your place is down there! -I know!
I came to say I love what you did to Freddy Prince's music.
I had to fix that tacky stuff, right?
Tacky?
You don't like Freddy Prince?
I don't like corny music.
Corny?
You're the first girl I know who doesn't like romantic music!
I don't like anything that isn't real!
-And what's love? -An illusion!
-What? -Love is an illusion
that guys like Freddy Prince use to fool the girls.
Of course not! I even believe in love at first sight!
To love a person just by looking at her?
Sometimes you don't even have to look!
Sometimes what the eyes don't see the heart feels.
-Isn't it the other way around? -Not in all cases, right?
Girl, what are you thinking?
Freddy Prince is here!
What will he say when he sees you're destroying his music?
Why destroying? The music is great!
What is this? Who are you?
I'm Freddy Prince!
Wow!
So you decided to surprise us!
Such a nice surprise!
-Freddy, it's almost midnight. Show time! -I'm going.
What's your name?
Cin... Cinderella.
DJ Cinderella!
Cinderella?
Freddy! It's time, go!
It's already midnight. I have to go!
Freddy, I love you!
The time everyone was waiting for!
Freddy!
With you... mine, yours, the more mine than yours,
Freddy Prince, to liven up the party!
Good night.
Beautiful!
When one day I'll find you again
In total danger
Fate will reveal itself
Come with me
I bet your dad thought you wouldn't come.
I also thought I wasn't coming.
Parties with you and my dad don't bring me good memories.
Why? He's so much better with me.
An attentive wife with daughters who respect him.
-Daughters! -They like him as a father
-Daughters! -They like him as a father and César also considers Graziele and Gisele as daughters.
-As long as he's sponsoring the parties. -What are you insinuating?
César!
Dad is very happy you came, darling.
Dad, I can't stay for long. Tomorrow I have wake up early.
But what about the show? Don't you like Freddy Prince?
She does! For sure!
Good! Honey, I'm going to take this out!
-No, my love! You look so handsome! -I'm too hot. I'll be back.
Thanks, guys.
Freddy!
So... Every show, I call a girl from the audience to dance with me.
Today, I want to call a different girl.
I don't know her face or name,
but I know she has attitude...
opinion and rhythm.
I call DJ Cinderella to the stage!
What?
Don't you dare to disguise yourself again and go.
If you do, I'll tell your father that you were the masked DJ.
Will you risk losing your secret DJ life?
A father like César can destroy your freedom
and without freedom nobody can dream, honey.
You heard that! Cíntia, Cíntia!
Put on the mask, Cíntia! The boy is calling on the stage...
-What's going on? -Nothing, love.
The boy called the DJ to dance but it looks like she's gone.
-Right, Helena? -What?
-Yes, she's gone. -Yeah?
Yes! She's gone and so are we.
-Wait, honey... -Leave it! Leave it.
-We didn't even catch up. -But look on the bright side.
We are already starting to get along.
She must have left by now. Continue the show. It's not possible, she must be back there.
Just a minute, guys.
Just a minute, guys, Freddy Prince will be back.
What's up? Did you find your runaway princess?
Just the sneaker.
When one day I'll find you again...
Lara, turn it off, for God's sake. I need to focus on the subject.
My scholarship depends on my grades!
Wow, what a bad mood. You're supposed to be happy.
Didn't you rock it yesterday at the party Rafa put you in?
I did, actually. That's why I need to focus here.
Being a DJ is what matters.
-Love only gets in the way. -What love? What are you talking about?
Your love... for Andre. It takes your focus away.
No, André doesn't take my focus away.
Andre is my focus.
Dating never harmed anyone. Cíntia, are you crazy?
-Really? My aunt dated a lot and... -And what?
Girl, Chicken sang so beautifully this morning, you should've heard it.
Right, momma's Chicken? Are you there, Dog?
You runaway Dog! You run from home and spend the night meowing!
Cíntia, don't forget to feed Cat, alright?
Eat everything, Cat! Kiss. Goodbye!
See? Boyfriends left her like this!
-Freddy Prince! -Now I remember where I knew you.
-I played in this house two years ago. -Really?
In a party that didn't end very well.
For me it ended well, right? I live here now.
With César and my daughters.
But to what do I owe the honor of this visit?
So...
I want to know who's the DJ who opened my show yesterday at the party.
I loved her.
Come with me.
Here.
She was the DJ. My daughter Graziele.
I met her at the party when I arrived.
Beautiful.
It's just that on stage she was so different.
-She had a mask, right? -Yes!
Of course.
Sorry.
I don't want to sound crazy, but...
there on the stage, I felt a very rare thing for her.
With all due respect.
I know... Love is a rare thing indeed.
Look, as a mother, I approve of it.
You're such a famous boy,
I mean, beautiful and romantic, right?
-Fit for Graziele. -She didn't look romantic at all.
She's naughty, but sometimes a little squeamish. We're always fighting.
I'll tell you why. Her dream is to be a DJ.
Her stepfather is against it, but I support her a lot.
So I gave her the idea of playing with a mask,
so he doesn't notice, you know?
But she gets nervous, poor thing.
So, well, can I see your daughter?
She's not at home! What a shame!
But look, we'll arrange this meeting, alright?
-Not here, because of the stepfather. -Where then? When?
Relax, kid. Leave it to me. I'll figure it out.
I'm good at it.
Come on! Let's stay just a bit more!
Let's go! Why would I want to see these guys?
André is so awesome.
Nice kick!
Yeah, right!
Hey, girls. Enjoying the game?
You can't imagine how much!
I have an invitation you can't miss tonight.
I got tickets for the Mid Night club!
I loved the invitation, André!
Lara, I've already told you, you lost your shot!
Well, the shots go, they come back, -they repeat themselves... -Lara!
-they repeat themselves... -Lara!
I'd love to go, I really like the DJ that plays there but...
But she won't go alone!
But if it's the four of us, she'll go. Right, girl?
-You can pick us up at seven. -Alright then!
At seven in your place, Cíntia.
Kisses, girls.
Thank you, girl! Thank you for running with it!
Lara is so clueless.
Then I had no choice, right? I'll have to go with the boy.
But, on the other hand, the nightclub is super cool,
everyone goes, the best DJs play there.
Aunt?
Aunt Helena?
Is there anyone there? Are you alright?
Rafa called and told me not to meet him in Recife.
I think it's so strange. He always wanted me to go.
Well, maybe he's busy.
I don't know.
He's always been crazy about me. What is this now?
It's my dream to play here!
What if I tell you my father owns this place? What would you say?
That it's a lie. I know your father and the owner.
I just wanted to make your dream come true, even if it was a lie.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, alright?
Of course I'm anxious, Bê.
I'll meet the princess of my life tonight.
Dude, calm down!
Even romance has limits, Freddy! What an exaggeration!
-You'll see, just wait! -Right!
I'm going to get a drink, alright?
-Do you want to dance, André? -No, I'm fine.
-Yeah... because I don't dance well? -No, I'm not in the mood.
To dance? Let's talk then, I also prefer...
-No, I'm not in the mood to do anything. -Fine, I'll do nothing with you.
-You have such a beautiful smile! -Lara, do something for me.
Go get us some soda. I'll be back later, alright?
Hi! Can you get me two sodas, please?
-Here, lass. -Thanks.
Sorry! I'll get another one for you.
Wait! You're Belinha, from the internet! I know your channel!
What a thrill! A follower of mine! What's your name?
Lara!
-Nice to meet you. -My pleasure, Lara.
So, do you agree when I say that today's women
have to value themselves, take care of their self-esteem?
Yes, of course, and I agree!
I think you, as a public person, have to open our eyes.
Good to know.
Sorry, but I could not help but listen to you talking to that dude.
It's André. I love him
and deep down I know he loves me too, you know?
-Yeah, but do you love yourself? -I don't understand.
Alright, relax, it was just a tip.
Do you want one or two sodas?
Two, please.
Two.
Look who I brought.
I'm sure you were born for one another.
Go, Gisele. Go take a walk, darling.
So it was you?
I couldn't forget about you since that party.
Neither could I. I'm such a fan of you!
Don't you think my music is tacky?
-What idiot would think that? -You.
Besides me, of course! But I was playing hard to get.
I'm a huge fan of yours.
-Do you have a map? -A map? What for, boy?
It's just that I got lost in the glow of your eyes.
How creative! Not!
-Tell me more about you. -What do you mean?
-The things you like, I don't know! -That's easy, I really like you.
I'm a really huge fan!
Do you know I'm organizing an organ donation campaign?
Seriously? That's cool! I'm surprised.
So why don't give your heart to me?
Girl, what can I do?
You're not a neck, but you turned my head.
No! Everything has a limit. Excuse me!
Are you sure you were the party DJ?
I was and I'm going to be whatever you want.
I'm such a fan!
Hello, everything cool? Do you have a map?
A map?
It's just that I got lost in the glow of your eyes!
Wow, so original! Loved it.
Excuse me, just a minute.
-Something's wrong, that's not her! -Mom, it isn't working! What do I do?
Go and kiss him now!
No, not again!
The soda Andre asked me for. By the way, where is he?
Lara, we're leaving now!
-Why did you do that? -Because I'm your biggest fan.
It's not possible! He didn't believe she was me.
-But you're not her, moron! -Yes, I am. You're jealous!
-No, you're not! -Silence! Nobody is anything here.
Except for mom.
Darling, we'll figure out something to make Freddy believe
that you're his beloved DJ, alright?
I don't know how, but I'll figure it out.
Mom, if I don't get Freddy I'm going to die! Is it a promise?
Stop. You'll have this boy!
That is a promise!
I think it must be really her, Freddy. Think with me.
It's her birthday. She wanted to play the DJ without her parents noticing.
Then she put on a mask. It makes perfect sense to me.
-Why? Was the kiss so bad? -No, that's not it. It's that...
I just want to make sure it's her. How do I make sure?
Just as the prince was sure about who Cinderella was!
Lost in distraction
Feeling the breeze blowing a name
That I can't understand
Imagine only you
Rafa! You're back from traveling. How was it?
Cool. But I'm leaving.
Like, for real. I just came to say goodbye.
How come? You and aunt Helena... Is that what I'm thinking?
But I have some good news for you.
I got a job for you at the Mid Night club.
No way! My goodness, Rafa! I don't know how to thank you.
This will help in the curriculum for the scholarship!
Look, I'm sorry for the mess with your father's party.
My bad, I'm sorry, I didn't realize... You know sometimes I'm kind of...
Dumb!
I was going to say "busy." But it's fine. "Dumb" is also good.
Take care of her for me.
Hello?
Hello, Rafael? You don't know me, my name is Suelen.
-Smooth! -No! It's not smooth, it's Suelen!
Well, anyway, I went to a party with my daughter and she loved the DJ.
The owners of the house gave me your contact.
-Smooth. -It's not smooth, honey, it's Suelen.
Anyway, I really wanted to know what's the next place -where this DJ will play. -Cíntia?
-where this DJ will play. -Cíntia?
She rocks, right?
She'll play next weekend at the Mid Night club.
-But it's for a little while! -Because?
Because she's awesome! She got a scholarship to study in London.
To see her play, you'll have to go there. Smooth?
That's more than smooth, dear. That's very interesting.
London, is it? Tell me more about it!
How cute!
Rafa got tired.
He wanted a serious relationship, I never corresponded.
Another woman did, for sure.
Love also gets tired of waiting, Cíntia.
Aunt, don't be like that.
-He gave it to you? -Yeah.
Since I always baptize my pets in honor of an ex,
-I'll call this one... -DJ.
It's a great name to remember Rafa.
There's a better name for it.
Love.
Love.
Those who know me or listen to me know that love is my guide.
And that's why I'm here on Belinha's Vlog,
who is my childhood friend, to leave a message.
DJ Cinderella...
I couldn't even say goodbye.
You really disappeared at 12 o'clock.
-I hope you listened... -See that?
Moron!
As I like yours.
I have your crystal shoe. I'll only return it personally.
Bring the other one to complete the pair.
On the seventh, at 2 p.m., at the Castle of Rock, where we met.
Confess! You're DJ Cinderella, aren't you?
Keep quiet!
My God! I want to scream because I'm angry!
My best friend has a romance with Freddy Prince and I don't know?
What romance, you loony? He doesn't even know who I am.
-He was kissing another girl. -It doesn't make sense, does it?
If he has another one, why did he post a love video?
It's written on his face.
It's the same face André makes when he looks at me in class.
Really? If I had doubts, they're gone now.
Listen, I don't want anyone to know about this. Or else...
Or else what, stone cold heart?
I'll tell André you have gum disease.
-Gross! -Cíntia.
Can I have a word with you? It's about a chat I had with your father.
Darling, I can't believe your father did something like that.
Very good, right mother? They made this exception only for me,
but I have to stay away from the others.
That's good, honey.
Look. About what you told me,
I think it's good that you're chasing your dreams, really.
But honey, don't close yourself to love.
Mom, love only causes pain. Why would I risk it?
Love is a risk and you're at the age of risking, kid.
It's not because my marriage with your father is over that I regret it.
Our love has brought me much happiness. And you're the greatest of all.
-Are you crazy? Do you want to kill me? -Don't overreact.
I'm not a witch from a children's book.
I come in peace. White flag. Can we talk?
You don't need to treat me as an enemy, Cíntia.
Enough, alright? You've been doing this for two years.
-And don't I have my reasons? -And I have mine, right?
But that is beside the point. What matters is that I can help you.
Just as I can accidentally tell your father
you're going to play at a nightclub.
-How do you know this? -I found a way.
The fact I know it changes nothing. But when your father finds out...
You'd make a point of telling him, of course.
Or not. And you see, he can even finally agree to it.
He'd never agree with me being a DJ.
Just as he'd never part with your mother, he'd never let you live here...
Do you see the power a woman has over a man who is in love?
-What's your angle, Patrícia? -My family, that's what matters.
I want peace, Cíntia, including for you, my dear.
And I can get you that.
-But peace has its price, doesn't it? -I knew it!
I want the shoe that you used at the party as a DJ.
I get it! You want Graziele to say she was the DJ at the party.
I've always found you unbearable, you know?
But I didn't think you were that smart.
Unfortunately, Graziele isn't as smart as you.
That boy is the big chance in her life.
-What? -And you must agree
-you two are not a match! -You can't know that.
Of course you can! Imagine.
What would a boy like that do to your life, Cíntia?
He'd mess up your goals. Because that's what love does, baby.
It blinds.
You already have an example at home with your mother, don't you?
Here, isn't that what you wanted?
Didn't I say you were smart?
You can come out now, Helena. I'm leaving!
Scoot! Scoot, you buzzard!
Come here, Cíntia. Am I crazy or did you give Patrícia the shoe?
She took the wrong shoe, aunt.
So today you play in peace without that hag blackmailing you
and tomorrow you have a chance with the stud.
What a great idea, girl!
So aunt, in fact, the idea wasn't mine.
-Who was it then? -It was Love's.
Sweetheart, come here!
This DJ is a minor.
I'm her father and I demand that she leaves immediately.
-Dad, don't do this, please! -He's already doing it, my dear.
Let's go!
You're not working at night like a nobody.
This is the doing of Helena and that lowlife boyfriend.
Of course. From now on, you're living with us.
-You can't do that. I'll run away! -Try.
I'll denounce your aunt Helena and that moron Rafael for exploiting a minor.
Is that what you want?
This is your new room, Cíntia.
The room is messy because of the renovations,
but Patrícia will find a way.
Super.
Darling, despite it all, dad's happy you came back to live here.
From now on, you'll have a present father.
-When will you travel, dear? -Tomorrow morning.
But I'll be back soon. I mean...
Well, anyway...
There's bedding in the closet.
-Why did you do it, Patrícia? -I didn't mean to have you here. Promise.
-Miscalculation, honey, it happens. -So why take my father to the club?
To avoid the risk of Fred finding you.
You're too stubborn, girl. You were going to see him, I know.
Tomorrow he becomes convinced that Graziele was the masked DJ.
I'll tell my father everything. He'll believe me. You'll see!
Let's make a bet? Let's bet on who has more power?
Let's bet, let me see... two reals.
What do you think? Up for a bet?
What is this? Stop!
-César! César! -Stop screaming! Are you crazy?
-What are you doing? -What's going on? What is this?
-César! -What is this?
César, I just asked Cíntia if I could call her daughter.
I wanted to be nice, and she attacked me!
Dad, I didn't attack this woman, I didn't do anything!
Enough! Apologize to Patrícia.
-Never! -Daughter, you crossed the line!
You'll be grounded at home. From now on, you only go to school.
That's it, until you graduate.
That's ridiculous!
You owe me two reals.
Attention!
Guys!
Attention, Fredylettes, Freddyloves, Fredminions!
No more turmoil. Freddy's in there, watching my live stream,
and when I identify the right shoe, I'll take the princess to him. Alright?
Come on! Get out!
Guys, it's a riot in here.
-Don't jump the line! -I'm priority, have patience.
And if there's any doubt, here it is. Proof that my daughter was the DJ!
-Come! -Come on, daughter!
Hello, beautiful! It's the owner of the party
where Freddy met the masked DJ
and if anyone knows her true identity, it's this woman.
Sorry, but I'll have to prioritize her, alright folks?
We've been here for hours!
Come on, people!
Just a minute!
Guys, now is the great moment!
Look, after you doubted my daughter was speaking the truth,
I thought I shouldn't let her come here and go through this.
But her love moved me
and I thought you deserved this second chance.
Here it is!
It's now, people! It's now!
-You're kidding, right? -What do you mean?
-That's the shoe! -No, it's not!
Of course it is, kid. I organized the party. I know!
-Guys, it's trouble! -Tell him, Graziele.
Freddy, I'm such a fan of you!
Okay, maybe I was wrong.
She has so many shoes. You have no idea.
What is this fixation for shoes? For the love of God.
Graziele is a wonderful girl. She sings like a nightingale.
Sing to him, daughter. Sing!
When one day I'll find you again
And a chance full of infinity
My God!
It will reveal itself Come with me
-I'm going to greet the sky! -It's alright, fine. Thanks?
-Sorry, Freddy but... -I know! You're a huge fan.
I get it.
I've always written about love and...
although I don't approve of what you did...
now I know what it's like to be in love...
and I think I understand you.
How cute!
Move, Graziele. Come, girl.
Come here.
And sorry, but I need to find my princess.
Freddy, you'll be sorry!
-Leave it. It's over. -It's over for you, moron!
For me it's just started.
Isn't revenge a dish you eat cold? And so it will be!
Guys, what a mess!
What's up, Freddy?
She didn't come.
-Oh, my God! -Come on, Lara! Let me go!
Girl, you don't know!
I'm going to prom with André. And what does that mean?
That he had no choice?
No, that he loves me, right? I always knew that!
Good for you guys then.
Come on, best friend! Cheer up!
I saw on Belinha's channel that Freddy's going on a long tour.
Are you trying to cheer me up, Lara?
No! Before leaving, he'll give another show
on our graduation party. Which means... you still have a chance, you silly.
-Is this true? -Truly true.
If I were you, I wouldn't wait for the party.
I'd look for him and sort this mess.
I'm grounded, remember? It's from school to home and period.
Even my cell phone was taken.
At least I could see Patrícia being embarrassed with the wrong shoe.
Yeah? And do you think she won't take revenge?
Friend, you can bet she's coming for you.
What else can she do against me?
Hello!
Hi, darling! How are you?
-Really? -Yeah!
César decided to donate more computers to the school.
I think that's great too.
Listen, when can I send the technician to install the software?
-I'm almost finished now. -Good.
-Will you excuse me for a minute? -Sure.
Thanks.
Hello, Mrs. Patrícia? Everything is cool.
You have access to the school system!
Very well!
You scared me, creature!
-What do you want? -Nothing!
I came to tell you daddy's here. That's it.
Fine.
I so want to go to prom!
-But isn't the party only for the grads? -Grads and family.
-We could go with Cíntia. -I'm grounded, remember?
César! Hi, my love.
Cíntia has behaved so well. It's her graduation. She has to go.
Guys, I hardly have any clothes. My things stayed at aunt Helena's house.
Of course you'll go to your graduation, daughter.
I don't want you to go to your aunt's house.
-But we can call a store here, right? -I'll call and they'll bring some options.
I can't believe my little girl is graduating.
-What will you study now, kid? -Thanks.
So... Dad, I'm one of the best students at school
and with my grades, I want to apply for a scholarship for a college in London.
Seriously? But what do you want to study?
Musical production. I want to be a DJ, dad.
-My love, DJ? -Dad...
Being a DJ isn't just about playing at night.
Being a DJ is also producing content, making music.
And you're going to live as a DJ?
Why not? So many people do. This is my passion.
You graduate and then we'll talk, alright?
I really liked it, dad.
-It's beautiful, my love. -It's really beautiful.
A bit basic, no?
But a black dress always looks good.
It's a but crumpled. Do you want me to iron it?
No, I'll do it myself.
Seriously, one of the best students at school? I'm stunned!
-It's the least she could do. Right, love? -But that's a lot, César.
Shall we check the grades on the school website?
Later...
I want to be proud of my stepdaughter too!
Gisele's coming. Come here.
Call your sister. César wants to talk to her. Go!
Cíntia, dad's calling you.
-Did you send for me, dad? -No, daughter.
Yes, you did, César.
We wanted to check Cíntia's grades on the school website.
The bulletin hasn't come out yet!
I think it has. I'm dying to see how the girls are doing.
I'm worried about Gisele, my love. Here. Check it out.
Cíntia! You failed in two subjects?
Are you kidding, dad? My grades are great, I know that!
-Great? -Five in Geography,
four and a half in History?
Look, I don't know what's your concept of great.
-That doesn't make sense! -It kind of does.
It must be hard to study by day and work at night.
-No! This isn't right! -Stop being a liar, Cíntia!
-But... -It's too much to discover
my daughter will repeat the year on prom day!
Dad, I'm not a liar.
-You're not a liar? -César, calm down!
Probably she meant to tell you after the party.
-No! -That's the point!
For you, it's all partying. You're ill accustomed.
Your princess life is over!
Fire! Fire!
My dress!
-You rascal! -Me? What do I have to do with it?
-Do you see, César, how she treats me? -Daughter! Hold on!
Are you crazy? Patrícia was with us all the time!
Cíntia, you must have left it!
You viper! Liar! I'll end you!
Daughter, stop it! Come here with me!
Father, you must believe me, please.
-I barely recognize you lately! -You really don't know me, dad!
-You're going to get grounded. -What?
The worst is that I still have to go to this party, for the girls.
We'll have a serious chat later. You and me!
You messed up Graziele's dream without any consideration.
Was it so hard to be more generous?
You gave me the wrong shoe and thought I'd leave it alone.
Payback can be really cruel, dear!
André, pick it up!
Pick it up.
Hello.
-Cíntia, I need to talk to Cíntia. -Make some sense, honey.
It's not the time of the day to call homes.
Please, I need to talk to my friend.
Cíntia is grounded, my dear. For an indefinite period.
Look, you better get another friend, alright? Kiss!
Selling something at this hour, do you believe it?
-Did you buy it? -Of course not!
Lost in distraction
Feeling the breeze
Blowing a name
That I can't understand
I'm going to miss you so much when you go on tour.
I'm happy with the tour.
But I can't stop thinking about DJ Cinderella.
It's difficult.
Look, Freddy, for real...
I think you need to wake up. If she didn't show up, it's because...
Cíntia!
Cíntia!
Cíntia!
Aunt!
-Aunt, the door is locked! -Here, child! Right here, behind you!
Come on, let's go! Rhythm, DJ! Help me here!
There you go!
I came to rescue you. Your friend called.
-You have to go to this prom. -How? I don't even have clothes!
Your aunt godmother has it all figured out, my dear.
-Here's your little dress! -This dress?
It's all we got! Be grateful!
The last time I wore this dress was two years ago
at my parents' wedding party. Do you know what that means?
That it's kind of musty, right?
-But the smell isn't bad. -No, aunt!
I was a fool who believed in love.
After everything I went through, I'll just dress up and chase a boy?
You can do anything you want. The question is: What do you want?
Friend!
-You're so beautiful! -Thanks.
-Did you bring the mask? -I did!
I brought a mask, and I brought a shoe.
Everything that got them together.
I won't fool you. There's a mega security scheme.
-No one's getting near the dressing room. -What if I play? Will he hear me?
-Good! Great! -Yeah, you at least still have hope.
My friend, how are you?
Angry at that Camila Abrantes. She ruined my chance with André.
But why hate this girl?
-André invited you to prom. -No, we won't hate today!
Let's dance, enjoy,
and in our case, Larinha, forget that men exist.
Wait, is Rafa here? With another one?
I'm going after her!
-The clowning's over! -Helena?
Listen here, you fool.
I've never needed a man in my life
until you showed up with a puppy called Love and got me disturbed.
-What? -Was I wrong? Yes!
But it was my way of loving. You should have straightened me up,
not dumped me for another one.
I won't have it!
Listen here, sweetheart, pay attention and see if you understand.
Got it? Or do you want me to draw it?
-I'll put that shoe in your face. -Helena.
-Scoot out of here! -Helena!
Helena, easy! I don't have another woman!
-Right! And who is she, punk? -I don't know, never seen her.
Poor girl! Girl, I'm sorry!
Rafa, I love you! Come back?
Do I have a choice? I love you too, my softie.
I'm glad you got along.
Cíntia! I like the mask!
Then take your place, DJ Cinderella, and attract your prince!
-What? I don't get it. -I'll explain.
Come, switch places, come!
Intern school would be great for Cíntia.
It would free her from the influences of her aunt and Rafael.
-I have doubts... -Hi. Let me introduce you. This is Diego.
Is everything alright, Diego? Excuse me.
-Am I wrong or you're... -Mom, we're getting to know each other.
-Is he rich, famous, something like that? -He's a normal boy!
What else could I expect from you?
A lowlife always looks for another one!
-Mom! -Truth hurts but strengthens, daughter.
Come on, Diego.
Mom... again this horrible version of Freddy's song?
Thought I'd never see you again.
Freddy! I really wanted to meet you!
I saw your calling on the internet. I mean, I don't follow you,
-but my friend Lara... -No need to explain.
You made that clear.
You said you didn't like Freddy Prince, that his songs were corny.
Love is an illusion. I was right.
-I was just another one. -Not! That isn't it!
-You're getting it all wrong. -You know, I believed
I'd find someone that really cared about me,
independently of fame or name.
And then...
when I finally found what I was looking for...
-you didn't feel the same for me. -But that's not it, listen to me!
Forget it. It's over. I'm not going to play the clown anymore.
Beautiful people, it's the last opportunity
to see Freddy playing in town in a long time.
So enjoy mine, yours,
more mine than yours, Freddy Prince!
When one day I'll find you again
In total danger
Fate will reveal itself
Come with me
Let's take a selfie here.
-Now with a kiss. -You know...
-I want to see Freddy. -No, this Freddy is awful.
André, what awful is spending my prom with a boring guy like you. Excuse me.
What's up, Lara?
Look, my bad for leaving you by yourself.
The good news is you got another shot.
If you want to be with me, this is the time.
Really, André?
I'm not another one in your contact list.
-So you'd rather be here alone? -Who said she was alone?
-Belinha from the internet? -In the flesh, bone
and two million followers. Is he bothering you?
No, this one doesn't bother me anymore.
Your shot's gone, right, André?
I'm very proud of you, girl. You did very well.
Clown.
I wish I'd taken a photo of his face at that moment!
It's you!
Look, I think I know this girl from somewhere.
This is Cíntia, my best friend.
She's the DJ who was playing now. You didn't recognize her because of her mask.
Freddy!
I found out who your princess is.
-She doesn't want anything to do with me. -Why are men so dumb?
I've figured it out, listen.
Cíntia! Calm down, girl! Calm down!
-You can't leave now! -I have nothing else to do here.
If my father sees me, I'll be dead.
No, you won't leave!
I always do this part of the show more towards the end,
but the girl that I want to call to dance with me
has the strange tendency to disappear.
My heart will explode!
To this day I didn't know her name and I didn't know her face either
or at least I thought not...
because I discovered that it's the same face I dreamt with for years.
-You have to go up there! -My father can't know!
-Now, everything I want... -I can't!
Is that you give me the honor of this dance...
-Cíntia Dorella. -Too late.
She won't dance.
She won't dance.
I'm responsible for Cíntia and she wasn't allowed to be here.
Get your hands off of Cíntia!
Mom! I don't believe!
Daughter, I asked your aunt to keep it a secret
because I wanted to be here for your prom.
She's my daughter, she has my authorization.
Ana, dear, sorry to disturb this moment
but Cíntia didn't graduate.
César grounded her because she failed. Right, honey?
Impossible. Cíntia is the best student in class!
-How come, César? -Unfortunately, it's true, Anna.
Mother, confess! You've changed Cíntia's grades.
I saw you fiddling with the school system.
-What on earth, Patrícia? -No! She's nuts.
She's crazy. Did you go insane?
That's right, mother! Truth hurts but strengthens, doesn't it?
People, Cíntia has more than enough to graduate.
So let's continue the party and we can sort that out later.
-César, my love, I can explain. -Let's go.
The girl isn't well, she needs therapy.
Go there.
Go.
So it was you.
Lost in distraction
Feeling the breeze blowing a name
That I can't understand
Imagine only you
I'm looking for the first track
I find only this tone
I expect some syllable
But nothing's done I only hear the breeze
Love at first sight
The dream awakened me
Your heart is my sound
Love at first sight
Your heart is my sound
And that's how our story started, people.
And, with ours, new stories also started.
Good!
Gisele has changed a lot.
You should call yourself Marv, girl.
-Why Marv? -Because you look marvelous.
And Graziele? She hasn't changed at all.
You want to go out with me? Graziele, you've never looked at my face.
But that was before you turned into a famous YouTuber. Now?
-Now I'm a super fan of you. -Really?
Girls, does anyone want to go out with me today?
-I do! -I do!
See? Now it's too late. You've lost your shot.
-Wasn't that my phrase? -What do you want, boy?
A chance.
What do I need to get your attention, Graziele?
Success! Is that the case? Then scoot!
-Aunt Helena and Rafa are super happy, -Goodbye, my Love!
and the puppy Love made his own puppies.
Don't forget to bathe Love.
-Don't forget the bath salts for Joy. -Cool, my soft little thing.
Patrícia? She left her daughters with my father
and went back to her home.
Mother, look here, I left everything clean for you.
Why all the ass-kissing?
Am I telling you to increase my allowance,
and stop being stingy because I deserve more money?
-Am I saying that? -You wouldn't dare!
Because I won't raise a penny!
And do me the favor of fixing the toilet!
It's clogged again and it keeps overflowing!
It's very dirty. Go, toughen up!
And do it right, because I'll check. Do you understand me?
If she's happy, that's another story, right?
I know we are. You can tell by your passionate faces.
-And London, did you like it? -Dude, it was awesome!
That's where we started playing together. Anyway... -You already know the rest. -Romantic pop
-You already know the rest. -Romantic pop with an electronic beat. It became a hit.
And...
Cut!
She danced smiling Different, a DJ pop star
He was an irreverent prince Suddenly saw everything change
And now where are you? I tried but don't know where to find
I look everywhere on the street And beyond
He was an inconsequential prince By accident he looked at her
She enjoyed a teen pop without worries He was enchanted
And now where are you? In my dream you continue to dance
In this rhythm I want to play, honey
Now I just want to love you
I've found you And I'll never leave you again
Lieutenant Dalton.
-[man] Herr Werner? -Yes.
I'm Lieutenant Dalton, up from Viden.
We've found a few inconsistencies in our records from your time with us
and we'd appreciate your help clarifying them.
-Thank you so much. -[Werner] Mm-hmm.
Please.
[woman] What do you want from us?
-It's all right. -He didn't do anything to you.
He was a medic.
I don't know what stories he's been telling you, but we know who he is, Vera.
but we know who he is, Vera.
My name is Annie.
No.
No, your sons Klaus and the other boy, Dieter, they...
-[Annie screams] -Shit! Shit! Moshe!
[Dalton] It's the wrong guy. It's not even him!
[Moshe] So, what?
He was a Nazi.
I bet he was on someone's list.
[Moshe] You gonna give us a hand or what? Come on.
[man 2] I remember reading years ago
some Austrian they mistook for me.
I have the article framed at home.
I hope that future historians
will not be tempted to stray from the truth as we record it here today.
I could talk of what I saw
at the pits, in Minsk.
Or the vans at Chelmno,
but these were the deeds and demands of others.
I issued no such orders.
Our work was paperwork,
our war a numerical one.
And though I struggled against endless idiocy,
I only did what little I could in Germany's fight against her enemies.
[woman] You said you wanted to take a job in Jersey.
Couldn't we run away? I'd do anything to be with you. Anything!
That's not a bad idea.
That's not a bad idea at all.
-Just tell me one thing. -Yes.
Is it true?
Is what true?
Is your mother a nigger?
[man] Tell me.
-[man shouting] Tell me! -[woman] What difference does it make?
-You love me. -All the kids talking behind my back.
-[man] Is it true? Are you black? -[woman] No!
[woman] No, I'm as white as you.
-[man] You're lying. -[woman] I'm not!
-[man] You're lying. You are! -[woman] I'm not! I'm not!
-[shushes] -[scoffs and chuckles]
-[man] So, you're German too? -[woman] Well, my father is.
I'd love to meet him sometime. Can I see you again?
Father made us learn 100 Spanish words a day.
-One hundred. -No more, no less. I was...
I was terrible.
I just wanted to ride horses and explore Tucumán.
What part of the Fatherland are you from?
[man] We moved all over during the war.
Oh, so your father, he was in the army?
SS, actually.
But he was killed in the East.
Oh, I thought, I thought...
[man] We live with my uncle now, Ricardo. He's, uh...
He's like a father to us.
[woman] I'm so sorry, Klaus.
That's awful.
Do you ever think about going back?
[Klaus] To Germany?
Um, I don't know.
I'm told things.
What things?
Oh, the Jews, clawing power back,
taking jobs, corrupting everything, like before.
But, of course, there are plenty of them here too so...
My uncle says they pop up everywhere, like mushrooms after rain.
-Mushrooms. -[Klaus chuckles] -[laughs] -[chuckles]
-[laughing] Mushrooms. -[woman laughs out loud]
A toast.
To your father.
A hero, I'm sure.
Tell me, would I recognize his name?
[man 1] Mr. Harel.
Mr. Harel. Just five minutes.
[man 2] Herr Harel, please. Sir, this is Herr Fritz Bauer,
he's the District Attorney of Hessen in West Germany.
He says he's found someone.
[Herr Fritz Bauer] I have a lead on a great enemy of our people.
I don't have time for this. Rafi, take care of it, okay?
[Herr Fritz Bauer] Adolf Eichmann is not just some pencil pusher.
This man deserves to be punished.
[Harel] You have the word of a blind man.
[Bauer] He doesn't need his eyes to hear the boy's name. Klaus Eichmann.
[Harel] Why would this girl, Sylvia, date a Nazi's son?
Hermann spent time in Dachau;
he decided to raise Sylvia Catholic.
[Rafi] She didn't know she was Jewish?
No.
Has he broken the bad news to her yet?
[Bauer chuckles] Yeah. She insists on seeing him still.
Says she's a good Catholic and the boy is, too.
[Harel] Okay. Thank you.
Listen, I really appreciate your coming,
but you have to understand. I got Egypt wreaking havoc,
the Fedayeen. Hikers getting killed at Masada.
Our resources are limited.
I can't waste them chasing rumors. I'm sorry.
Think what it means.
Jews finally, publicly, holding to account the man who organized our slaughter.
Organized. Past tense.
It is my job, Herr Bauer,
to focus on those who are planning it today.
Thank you very much for coming.
-Please-- -[Harel] Thank you very much.
Just give me one second.
Sir?
Let's say he's right.
Can you imagine the headache when he tells the world
that we wouldn't waste our resources on the architect of the Final Solution?
Slowly.
What are you...?
Shall we just stand here?
You're waving at my crotch in a weird way.
Just get in there. Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid, we're focusing on technique.
Okay, well technically, do it better.
You know why they throw all the shittiest jobs at you, right?
I don't know, antisemitism?
Shall we?
Don't be scared.
-Hey. -Hey, Rafi.
-[Rafi] Aharoni, come with me. -[Aharoni] You got it.
-Where you going? -[Rafi] Aharoni's got a flight to catch.
I'll call if I need you.
-[Klaus] Sylvia. -Thank you.
-[Sylvia] Klaus, hi. -Hey.
You made it.
-Let me show you through. -Could we go somewhere first?
-I need to tell you something. Okay. -Can we wait? He's about to speak.
Carlos.
-[Klaus] This is Sylvia. -[Sylvia] Hello.
My word.
Look at those eyes. Your hair.
Where's your family from?
-[Sylvia] Um, I'm... -[man] We're ready for you.
Come.
[Klaus] You see those two?
That's the Deputy Mayor and a member of Parliament.
[Sylvia] Who is that man you introduced me to?
[Klaus] Carlos Fuldner. He helped my family settle in Argentina.
Amigos...
our hundred fiftieth Independence Day approaches.
[Carlos] There will be a chance for us to dance,
to drink, for freedom.
[Carlos] But have you noticed the road blocks...
...gunshots,
violence,
every day across Buenos Aires?
Now should be the time to celebrate our national unity,
the iron bond of church and state.
It doesn't decay, amigos.
A rot within our society,
that is forcing us to fight for our beloved and holy patria.
Who can tell me its name?
Jew!
[in Spanish] Thank you, Father.
Loyal only to themselves.
The Jew will betray our homeland
and continue poisoning this great nation of Argentina.
So, I ask you.
What should we do with the Jew?
Soap.
Again.
What must we make of the Jew?
[crowd] Soap!
-Jew! Jew! Jew! -[crowd] Soap! Soap! Soap!
[male player 1] Okay. Are you in, or are you out?
-[male player 2] In. -[male player 1] Peter, your turn.
[male player 1] Peter, let's go. Play.
Hey, hey, hey!
Come on, kids.
Hello.
Mama?
Mama, what's wrong? What happened?
[mother] Your sister.
She was on top and I closed it.
It's all right. I'm sure she forgives you.
Look.
Beautiful.
Go put them in some water. I'll clean up.
New refrigerator, huh?
Who'd you kill to get that?
Seriously, should I worry? Is there a dead body in there?
I haven't seen Hanna lately.
Mama, please.
What? First you see her all the time.
-No relationship talk. -You were ready...
-We've been over this. Eat your soup. -...to start something. Poof. She's gone.
Please.
Peter, don't you dare. It's Shabbat.
It could be an emergency.
Don't come complaining to me if you get sick after eating cold soup.
Who gets sick from eating cold soup? Ma, please. Hello.
Is this about the Astypalaia thing?
Because, to be honest, I've read maybe 70% of the briefing.
-[Rafi] No, it is not. -Okay, good, 'cause it's more like 30%.
Finale.
[Rafi] Aharoni's out there now running reconnaissance in Buenos Aires
with our guy at the Embassy.
Our contact's daughter, Sylvia Hermann,
has agreed to take us to Klaus Eichmann's family home.
If it is Eichmann, they will attempt to get a positive photo ID.
Why didn't you ask me? Aharoni's an interrogator.
[Rafi] Precisely.
I wanted someone who would interrogate the evidence rather than just shoot at it.
This is strictly catch and extract.
Raf, if it is him, a bullet would be easier than dragging him here.
Eichmann will stand trial here in Israel.
Trial? Nobody needs to hear what he has to say.
[Rafi] The Prime Minister disagrees.
A trial will help put all of this to bed.
After all, not everyone's as emotionally balanced as you are.
Peter, it isn't about you, okay?
Okay. I'm in.
[Harel] You're not going.
Every op leader describes you as manipulative, impulsive and self-absorbed.
[Peter] No one mentioned my sense of humor?
[Harel] And the fiasco in Austria.
The strings I had to pull. You killed the wrong damn Nazi!
I remember, sir. It wasn't even the right Nazi.
We are talking about violating Argentina's sovereignty
while they are celebrating 150 years of independence.
If we fail, Israel will be humiliated,
the local Jews terrorized, and I've lost some of my best agents.
So, what makes him worth the risk?
For starters, this current plan's a real piece of shit.
[Harel] Great start.
[Rafi] Peter.
If you wanna get him out alive, you need a basic crew.
No soldiers, no guns. Period.
If we get into a shoot-out, we've failed already
and it says here that you want to extract him
via shipping container, but that would take weeks.
We do that, he won't make it past Rio. The only way is by plane.
[Harel] Military planes can't reach Argentina.
You think I haven't thought about it?
No, I'm sorry. Of course, sir. Of course.
I'm guessing El Al is not an option.
El Al doesn't fly commercially to Argentina.
Perhaps if we had a good cover story, they could be convinced?
Maybe.
[Peter] You said it's Argentina's 150th anniversary, right?
Yeah.
So we get ambassadors, politicians, whatever,
send them over there to say, "Mazel tov. Hurrah for independence."
[Rafi] We'll invite Abba Eban, everybody loves him.
Then we sneak Eichmann on board, airlift him here direct.
[Harel] What about airport security?
I'll disguise him to look like one of us.
-[Rafi] He'll struggle. -We'll sedate him.
Make him seem hung over, drunk to shit.
[Harel] To keep him in that state for hours.
-The only agent that we have-- -[Rafi] Had.
What?
She's refused every job I've offered her after Bren.
That wasn't Hanna's fault though. The guy was allergic, right?
She's the only one with the right field experience for this.
-I'll get her to do it. -I thought you two weren't...
-What, together? -Speaking.
She'll do it, trust me. Sir...
we'll get him back here alive.
Get Hanna on board, then we talk.
-Five minutes. Hear me out. -I don't wanna hear.
Is Mrs. Levington in prep? ECG done?
-You know how important this is. -Hi, Michael. See you tonight.
Who's Michael?
What's tonight?
The trains that shipped the families to the camps, that was him.
-I'm not joining your hit squad. -[Peter] No, that...
Yes, I would happily put a bullet in-between his eyes,
but that's not what we're doing.
Did you hear what happened last time?
Yeah. Rafi told me. The guy was allergic.
That's what he told you?
[Hanna] No, we kept on landing and refueling.
Rafi kept telling me to put him under again and again and again.
So, I did.
That was Rafi's fault, not yours.
My needle, my fault.
First do no harm, that's what we swear, and I won't break it, not again!
That's why we need you.
In Buenos Aires.
Where we'll need you to eat steak.
And drink red wine and definitely go tango dancing.
I need you.
-[Aharoni] Another road block. -[man] For the 150th.
The government says they're protecting democracy.
They're all over the city.
What are they so afraid of?
[man] Commies.
Jews.
Nacionalistas, Peronistas.
Depends who you ask.
You clear on the plan?
Knock on the door, deliver the gift,
get his uncle outside, don't give them cause for suspicion.
Enough of that to go around already.
[Aharoni] Listen carefully, all right?
If you're feeling any kind of danger whatsoever, you get out.
It's going to be all right.
Yes. May I help you?
Hello. My name is Sylvia. I'm...
You're the Sylvia.
We wondered whether we would get to meet you.
Well, come in.
-Come in. -Thank you.
Oh, I'll just...
[Sylvia] Oh my, those are beautiful.
Oh, aren't they?
Is it a special occasion?
This year even more so.
Smell them.
Smell them.
Oh, hello there.
[woman] Oh, darling. This is Sylvia.
The Sylvia.
Such a pleasure.
[Sylvia] Klaus and I had a bit of a disagreement, so I thought I would come over and...
try to fix things.
-[woman] Oh. -[baby coos]
That's very thoughtful.
I'll make us come coffee.
Oh, no thank you. I can't stay long.
No, please. We're delighted to have you.
[Eichmann] The munchkin is ready for a nap.
Papa is ready for munchkin to have his nap.
So, what do you think?
I'm sorry?
The house.
I mean, there's still no electricity, but she's getting there.
Yes, it's quite lovely, Herr...?
Klement. Señor Klement.
[Sylvia] Señor Klement.
I'm sorry.
[Eichmann] The disagreement you had.
I don't wish to pry, but would you describe to me its nature?
[Klaus] Sylvia, what are you doing here?
-[Eichmann] Hey, watch your tone, Klaus. -I just came to apologize.
Klaus, you're just in time for coffee.
No. Sylvia's leaving.
Now hold on just a minute.
Klaus. I said wait a moment.
This is how I taught you to behave, is it?
I'm sorry, Father.
You've no need to call me that.
[Klaus] Sylvia.
[Klaus] Sylvia.
-[Aharoni] Did you get it? -[man] I don't know.
[Aharoni] What about the girl?
She'll take the bus.
Get out of here.
Sylvia.
Listen.
You embarrassed me.
-Leaving the meeting like that. -I know.
I had to leave, and I'm sorry.
Carlos...
He said he thought you might be a...
I am.
[Sylvia] Does that really matter to you?
[Rafi] Isser is here.
[Rafi] This is Dani Shalom from documents, and you know Moshe, he'd handle the vehicles.
[Harel] Where's Hanna?
Sorry I'm late, sir.
That steak better be good.
[Harel] Okay.
[Harel] This is everything Sylvia Hermann could give us.
As for the pictures, our guy at Tel Hashomer Hospital is saying the ears match.
Hardly compelling evidence.
Sylvia heard Klaus call him father.
-"You don't need to call me that." -[Harel] Not enough.
You have to make sure it's him. Give me documentary proof. Come on.
Wait. Look.
The flowers.
-Here. -Vera implied it was a special occasion.
"This year even more so."
-What date was Sylvia there? -Uh...
[Hanna] Here.
The marriage certificate.
-[Rafi] Hey, careful. -Like it makes a difference.
There's a system to this.
[Peter] Here.
Why is 1960 a special year?
Because 25 years ago Adolf Eichmann
married his wife, Vera Liebl, on the 21st of March.
[Peter] We have our guy.
Ricardo Klement is Adolf Eichmann.
[Peter] All right. Round two.
-[piano playing] -[Peter] Next week in Buenos Aires.
Yaakov, welcome. Our wonderful front man.
He's a little ugly, but we'll make do, right?
Okay. For the ones who can't.
May his name be obliterated, huh?
So, why are we making him famous?
[Moshe] We should be putting him down like a mad dog.
That's not what I'm here for, Moshe.
[Moshe] Yeah?
How many did you lose?
I'm not competing with you.
What?
-We're really doing this? -Yeah.
[Yaakov] All right, asshole.
My parents, aunts, uncles, four cousins.
Dachau.
[Dani Shalom] I'm the only one left.
[Peter] Hey, Moshe, enough.
All right? Raf, you know any rock 'n roll?
Is the Pope Catholic?
-[piano playing cheerful music] -This.
-Shall we dance, yeah? Let's. -Let's dance.
[Harel] On your feet for the Prime Minister.
[Rafi] Oh, shit. It's Ben-Gurion. Get up. Get up.
[man] Sir.
-Is this all of them? -Yes.
[Ben-Gurion] Good.
If you succeed...
we deny the world the chance to let Eichmann's...
murderous edicts sink into obscurity.
For the first time in our history, we will judge our executioner.
We will also warn off any who may wish to follow his example.
If you fail...
he escapes justice.
Perhaps forever.
For the sake of our people, I beg you, do not fail.
[Ben-Gurion] Our memory reaches back through recorded history.
[Ben-Gurion] The book of memories still lies open.
And you here now...
are the hand that holds the pen.
Why have they sent you?
-Disappointed? -[chuckles]
[Yaakov] I think we'll take this one.
[official] Excellent.
Good choice.
[in Spanish] Yes.
[Yaakov] And an apartment for my assistant. Nothing fancy.
Keep your hands to yourself.
Or Malkin will kick my ass?
I'll kick your ass.
There's still the thing with you two.
[Yaakov] He'll let you down, you know?
[Yaakov] He lets everyone down.
[Yaakov] Ladies and gentlemen, behold, terra, the best safe house money can buy.
With the finest in counter-surveillance technology.
[Eichmann] I've lived enough of life looking over my shoulder.
I only did what little I could in Germany's fight against her enemy.
[Carlos] What a narrative. What tales.
[Carlos] Tell me, these story telling sessions, are they for money or for pleasure?
For posterity, to correct the lies told by those swine at Nuremberg.
You left so quickly after our rally, we didn't have a chance to talk.
I wasn't aware a discussion was to be had, Carlos.
You saw the support we have.
The government is teetering. Soon we can come out of the shadows.
All we need is organization.
A mind like yours.
-[Peter] Who's this Fuldner guy? -[Aharoni] SS Officer.
Worked with the Vatican,
then Peron to get Hitler's higher-ranking officers out of Europe.
They keep a low profile, but they'll make themselves known if we slip up.
-I've written this all down. -Oh.
Yeah, I'll read this.
Right.
[Peter] The man is a human metronome.
Every morning he goes to work at a Mercedes factory in Gonzales Catan,
same time, same two buses, there and back.
[man] Why don't we grab him at the factory?
[Rafi] It's too public. One witness and we're screwed.
[Peter] And on his journey home it's darker, there's fewer witnesses.
[Dani] Any blind spots?
There are lamp posts here, here, and here.
There's a blind spot about five meters. Should be pitch black at night.
That's where you grab him,
and then hold him here a few hours ahead of flying.
-[Peter] Can we get him to the airport? -No, It's too dangerous.
[Hanna] I'll be giving him micro doses of Haloperidol throughout security.
The set-up needs to be precise,
so fixing it in the back of the car, it's too risky.
The wrong dose and he could slip into cardiac arrest.
Okay. Everyone got what they need?
[Yaakov] Strips of soft metal.
-[Harel] Okay. -Tin, ideally.
[Ilani] Write it down.
I'm putting together a squad of sayanim to help.
Are we sure we can trust the local Jews to be loyal to us and not the Argentines?
Yeah. Efraim worked with them before, right?
Yeah, that's correct. They know the city, speak the language.
They'll help limit our exposure.
People are gonna say it's a real international Jewish conspiracy.
-[everyone chuckles] -[Harel] Okay. Hey, the plane will arrive in four days.
This is the last time you're gonna see me until we have him.
If you need me, leave me a note at the Embassy.
Otherwise, no contact in case I'm followed.
We'll exchange money and documents in cafes.
From now on, every move you make, and every second it takes,
counts for everything, so don't make any stupid mistakes.
That's very inspiring.
-[Moshe] What about his family? -[radio in Spanish]
[Moshe] What if they call the police or worse?
[Peter] Authorities aren't gonna stick their necks out for a Nazi on Independence Day.
And the safe house still isn't right. I'm telling you. Three days isn't enough.
We're gonna make it work. Relax. Stop worrying.
[Moshe] Sounds like Khrushchev got some American.
-Spy pilot I think. -[Peter] Shit.
Poor guy.
I hear the Commies like to use their fingernails, tear 'em out.
[Peter] Shots of adrenaline straight after, stops you from fainting.
[Moshe] Think the Argies would do that to us?
[Moshe] You ever think about whether we'll get to do that to him?
[Peter] That's not why we're here.
[Moshe] Come on, Habibi.
You're telling me that after what that fuck did to us,
you didn't want someone here ready and willing to make him scream?
-You can have the bed, sir. -Yaakov, son of a bitch.
[Ilani] ...and never return to the same store in the same day.
You'll work in shifts.
-My father... -[Ilani] Graciela?
My father said we'd be paid?
Expenses only, I'm afraid.
The real reward will be when Rabbi Levy dedicates a hymn to you.
Graciela, you'll work in the safe house. The rest of you...
-[Hanna] Do you want another one? -[Peter] Maybe.
One more.
-Hey, Moshe. -[Moshe] Yeah.
Talk to me.
I saw him with his boy.
His son. Beautiful little boy.
They were watching the trains go by.
We're gonna get him.
He needs catching first.
-[man 1 in Spanish] Need any help? -[man 2 in Spanish] No, thank you.
-[man 1 in Spanish] Need any help? -[man 2 in Spanish] No, thank you. [man 3] No.
Who the hell was that?
You ever seen that guy before?
[Peter] Here he comes.
I don't wanna touch his mouth.
-[Peter] Where is he? -[Rafi] Shit. He knows. He must know.
[Aharoni] We need to leave.
His wife and kid are home. He wouldn't leave without them.
-[Rafi] He's done it before. -We have to warn the others. Let's go. Let's go!
Look.
Him..
-[Moshe] It's him. -[Aharoni] Why is there a second bus?
And that cyclist. I don't know, something feels off.
Your call.
Start the engine.
-Get the sedative. I got him. -Make a sound and I'll kill you.
[Peter] Just be quiet, you'll be all right.
[Rafi] Okay. Let's go.
[Peter] Cover his hands.
[guard speaking Spanish] Diplomatic plates. Wave them through.
If you speak without being spoken to, you will be gagged.
Open your eyes.
I want you to tell me your name.
[Eichmann] My name is Ricardo Klement. I'm a Jew from Palestine.
No, you're not.
[Eichmann] I was born in Serona, the German quarter. I know my prayers. Listen.
Tell me your name.
Shma Yisrael, adonai elohenu, adonai echad.
[Eichmann] You see?
You've made a mistake.
Drop me anywhere. Blindfold me.
I won't tell anyone what you've done.
[in Hebrew] Where did you live?
I'll admit I'm a little rusty.
You were born in Solingen in 1906.
Your father was named Adolf.
-Your mother Maria Shefferling. -I don't know those names.
It's not true. My surname's Klement.
Yet the boy you raise has the name Eichmann, does he not?
His father died during the war.
So, you let another man's progeny call you father.
What is your current profession?
Foreman. Mercedes Benz factory.
-Current address. -14 Garibaldi Street.
-What is-- -What is your wife's name?
Vera. Vera Liebl.
Who is your son Klaus's father? What is your name?
I am Ricardo Klement.
So, you raise another man's child, but you feel only obligation, correct?
Should something happen to him, like,
oh, I don't know, let's say he should suddenly...
disappear tomorrow,
a part of you wouldn't care?
You once had a mistress named Maria Masenbucher.
-Did you not? -Not that I recall.
That's interesting, because she gave us a picture.
Do you recognize the man in this picture?
I can't see him clearly.
Who has his glasses?
The man in this picture is you.
SS number 45381. Am I correct?
Again. Your number was 45381.
[Aharoni] Your number was 45381.
45381. 45381!
It was 4-5-3-2-6.
Enough. I accept my fate.
My name is Adolf Eichmann.
-[Rafi] All right. -[Hanna laughs]
[Rafi] Enjoy. We pack up after dinner.
What's wrong?
[Peter] We've got him.
Peace?
My mama spends her days in a dark apartment alone,
because of what men like him have done.
When she can see the look on Eichmann's face
when he finds himself in a country full of us,
that's when I'll have peace.
Come on, Klaus. Rack your brain. Who knew?
[Ilani in Spanish] Is the plane ready?
[in Spanish] I've got bad news.
[Peter] All right, let's get changed and get out of here.
[Ilani] Listen everyone.
There is a problem with the flight. -[Peter] What? -[Harel] What?
The airport says it's delayed by ten days.
-Nobody knows. -[Peter] Shit. Ten days! Oh, shit.
It's coincidence. It's too soon for anyone to know.
-Not if they found the glasses. -[Aharoni] They know.
[Rafi] Okay. Ephraim, tomorrow morning you and Moshe, you return the cars.
If they quibble about damages, you pay whatever they say.
-[Ilani] We'll need money. -I'll take care of it.
We're gonna need to watch him 24 hours a day. We'll do it in shifts.
We're gonna need to watch him 24 hours a day. We'll do it in shifts. Now you need us in the room with him?
He could swallow his tongue, try to hang himself.
We're not gonna let him get out of this. Understood?
[Rafi] Aharoni's the only one who speaks to him.
If you have something to say, keep it to yourself. Got it?
[Moshe] And if they find us?
We're not just gonna let him go, are we? [Rafi] Hey. Shh.
-Quiet. He can hear everything. -[Peter] We have him.
Now we just lay low, play the "who's the worst cook than Rafi?" game.
-Mm-hmm. -[Peter] Hard part's over.
[Rafi] Germany issued an extradition request a few months back
and they suspect he's hiding here, too.
[Harel] Okay.  From now on, nobody leave this house.
-[Aharoni] That's right. We all sit tight. -[Hanna] A scared old blind man.
-It's our fault they got him. -[Peter] What are you doing here?
The police arrested Lothar Hermann, claiming he's Joseph Mengele.
-Joseph Mengele. -[Rafi] Yeah.
The angel of death himself.
-[Hanna] This is a bad joke. -This is Fuldner's people.
They're using him as bait.
[Harel] It's worse than that. El Al is refusing to send a plane.
They say first they need something from us.
A signed document from Eichmann saying he'll willingly come to Israel.
[Peter] What?
-They're out of their minds. -Enough!
Can't we have Dani fake it?
No, we have no idea what his signature looks like.
Aharoni.
Can you squeeze a signature out of him?
Can you?
Of course, yeah.
Well, he's going to need to read it. Did you replace the glasses that you lost?
Thank you. For these.
[Eichmann] I'm grateful.
You want me to stand trial in place of an entire regime?
I'm offering you a fair trial.
If these are German crimes, they should be tried in German courts.
-That's not an option. -Ask your superiors to negotiate.
If they refuse, I do, too.
I've no desire to be your scapegoat.
I'd argue the Architect of the Final Solution has plenty to answer for.
The Architect... of the Final Solution.
-Do you deny your title? -We love nicknames.
They used to call me the Little Jew.
Did you know that?
I read about Nuremberg.
Those swine, Wisliceny and Höttl.
Blaming the absent to escape the noose.
Well, then refute them. Come to Israel.
Make your case to the world.
I would rather die...
than have my history told the way someone else would like it to have been.
You have no interest in what I have to say,
unless it confirms what you think you already know.
[Aharoni] Tell me, what is it that I think I already know?
The...
-May I have a cigarette? -You may not.
[Eichmann] The exact consequences of my work were kept hidden from me.
I was merely a cog in a machine...
-[indistinct chatter] -...digging its way to hell.
By the end, I was chained to my desk.
Twenty hours a day.
My job was simple.
Save the country I love from being destroyed.
Is your job any different?
But none of what I say matters. Your lawyers and your lying press
will try the man they think they know, not the one who sits before you now.
[Rafi] Forty, sixty, eighty, five hundred.
Okay.
Graciela?
-[Rafi] Eh... -Si?
[Rafi] Uh, groceries.
[Aharoni] Can someone else feed him?
-[Moshe] It's your turn. -[Aharoni] I know.
I'm... I'm asking for a favor.
[Peter] All done.
You're the man who grabbed me. I know your voice.
Yes.
Please, just tell me. My family, are they safe?
[Klaus] You said you had news.
Do you know the number of people buried here because they wouldn't listen?
Everyone should visit this place once in a while
to remember things can go the wrong way if you don't behave the proper way.
Two Jews returned a rented Buick to a shop near Acassuso.
[Carlos] They paid for it in US dollars,
but the vendor called the police when he saw the license plate had been tampered with.
-And the rental documents? -We don't know.
Their identification was forged.
We'll talk to shopkeepers.
If so much as an empanada is paid for in dollars, I want us to know.
[Peter] It's too tight.
[Ilani] Don't any of them come with some actual shape to them?
-Is there any medium? Okay. -[Harel] We are running out of time.
[Harel] We have to get the signature.
[Aharoni] He's being belligerent.
The problem is he's got no incentive to sign it.
If the easy way doesn't work, do it the hard way.
You have my permission.
This guy convinced rabbis to load the trains themselves.
[Peter] And not by force.
You can't strong arm a guy like that,
but if we can relate to him, if you appeal to his--
Humanity?
His ego makes him feel like he's in control.
I appreciate you're trying to help, but he's as slippery as they come.
Spots tricks a mile away. This only works if we wear him down.
If he knows there's no escape, eventually he'll yield.
-That's not working. -You've done your job.
Will you leave me to do mine?
[Eichmann] Let's put the shoe on your foot, shall we?
You're a soldier ordered to make me sign this,
but are you or your superiors responsible for that order?
I'm offering you a fair trial.
[Eichmann] Herr Captor, I need the lavatory, please.
It's quite serious.
This would be much easier if I had something to read.
Should we lend him your copy of Mein Kampf or mine?
I remember visiting my father at the Tramway and Electrical. I was nine.
He introduces me so proudly.
"My boy!" He says, "This is my boy!"
So, imagine my dismay when I had to use the bathroom and unleash sheer hell.
I said, "Everybody does it, Papa. Everybody shits."
I think about that still, to this day.
If only you'd cover my nose as well as my eyes.
[Yaakov] So, this is the master race.
Oh, we used to say to be the perfect Nazi, you had to be as slim as Goering, as tall as Goebbels, and as blond as Hitler!
you had to be as slim as Goering, as tall as Goebbels, and as blond as Hitler!
May I wipe now, Herr Captor?
[Eichmann] My family, are they safe, please?
-Of course, they are. -[gasps]
-What do you think of us? -Thank you. [clears throat] Thank you.
[clears throat] Thank you.
Herr Captor.
I wonder if I might keep speaking with you.
That Jobnik they send, he won't listen.
Round face, straight brown hair. Heavy set.
I want eyes at all major transit points.
This is one of the Jews who took Ricardo Klement.
-[Moshe] Do you want some more? -[Hanna] No, thank you.
[Yaakov] Oh, great, beef again.
I'd kill for a fish.
[Rafi] Shut up and eat your cubed cheese.
Why is it so bland?
-[Aharoni] It's missing the bacteria. -Or a nice goat's cheese.
-[Aharoni] It's missing the bacteria. -Or a nice goat's cheese. [Rafi] You know that Lifta cheese back home?
It's really strong.
[chuckling You remember when Miriam made a cheesecake with it by accident
and you ate a whole slice just to make her happy.
[laughing] "No, Mir, this is really good. Thank you."
You know, Lifta is an Arab cheese. Is it? I didn't, uh,
Is it? I didn't, uh, -ask to see its papers. -Oh, this is a joke, right?
-ask to see its papers. -Oh, this is a joke, right?
[Moshe] Giving money to our enemies.
The people who want us dead. It's hilarious.
Aharoni, you tried that one yet?
-See if it works on Eichmann. -He'll sign. We're close.
We should string him up and beat a signature out of him.
[Moshe] That's what they'd do to us, but no, that'd be too easy.
Instead we have to feed him.
Relax, Moshe. It's just cheese.
[Ilani] Moshe.
You're up next.
No, it's all right.
[Peter] I'll take his shift.
Why won't you sign?
I'm an Argentine citizen accused of crimes committed in Germany.
Don't be modest.
Lithuania, Hungary, Poland. You were quite the traveler.
I should be tried in one of those countries.
Nah.
I don't buy it.
You can't win a war if soldiers don't follow their orders.
No, that's not good enough.
-The truth will out. -What is truth? Whose truth?
-No one will listen to me. -I wanna listen.
Be treated like a dog. A show trial.
To pin everything on me. We held those, too, you know.
The preening prosecutors, the compliant judges.
[inhales] My God. This--
[inhales] That's--
You look like shit.
Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt you.
Some of your men want to. I can smell it when they're in the room.
-May I ask you something? -I'm not in a position to refuse.
Is it true you called the camps "liquidation machines"?
Mengele called you all kosher salami.
Everyone used flippant terms for dirty work.
-To make us seem like animals. -We're all animals.
Fighting for scraps on the Serengeti.
Some of us just have bigger teeth than others.
You know I tried to help.
For years, I got your people out of the country.
That was my solution. I wanted the Jews sent to Madagascar.
Yes, dying of malaria is nicer than poisoned gas. Very thoughtful of you.
Other countries wouldn't take you.
But that didn't stop me from trying. I negotiated.
With your Dr. Kasztner in Hungary.
Trucks for lives.
We tried to save Jewish lives.
He was a hero,
yet your people shot him in cold blood. Imagine what they'd do to me.
-[Peter] I didn't know about that. -Hmm.
That's why you're here, Herr Captor.
To make me think Israel will listen to me.
I just always fancied myself a barber.
Your razor.
The brand?
It's a lot older than you, I think.
From Solingen, like me.
My Papa died in Israel.
One of those pesky Jews who survived.
[Adolf] Oh. So, you didn't lose anyone.
I'm glad.
I don't know what I'd have become if my family had...
[Peter] I spoke to him.
[Hanna] Why?
I was trying to get him to sign.
-Curious. -What did he say to you?
He said we're all animals.
The Jews? No, no, everybody. Jews, Germans. All animals.
No, no, everybody. Jews, Germans. All animals.
Bullshit.
If we're animals, he would be in pieces now.
-He says he was following orders. -He chose to do it.
And we are choosing to keep him alive.
To let him speak, but not here, not now.
Keep your distance.
-[music playing] -[Peter] Eleven...
twelve...
thirteen.
The boys love this.
-Fourteen -I prefer the older stuff.
-Carlito Gardel. -Fifteen.
-El Zorzal Criollo. -Sixteen.
-Seventeen. -[pants] Enough.
-Enough? -Enough.
[pants] Tell me about you,
Herr Captor.
I want to know what it was that brought our lives together like this.
How about this? You sign, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Ah-ha. You're striking a deal.
I'm establishing a trading post.
But I'm fresh out of trucks before you ask.
It is... ha!
It is poor form to negotiate from a position of weakness.
There's an art to these things.
Always know the man who sits across the bargaining table.
Well, now's your chance.
You sign, I'll tell you anything you wanna know.
I would like to offer a counter.
Your name in return for my consideration of your terms.
Just your name.
Is that asking so much?
-Dani. -[coughs]
[Harel] We are running out of time.
[Harel] I'll see you in an hour.
I am so close, sir. He's going to break. I know he's going to break.
I am so close, sir. He's going to break. I know he's going to break. [Rafi] We're hearing Nazis are searching the neighborhood.
I recommend we move Eichmann to another safe house.
[Harel] We can't move him. It's too risky.
Forget the damn paper. Forget him signing. Let's just get him out.
It's more complicated that, Yaakov. El Al is the only way out.
-What do you mean it's more complicated-- -Yaakov. Let's just relax, okay?
[Eichmann] Look at me.
I do want the world to know what really happened.
But it needs to be fair.
People have to listen.
In Israel, they'll just want to see me suffer.
[Peter] No, not if they see you the way I've seen you.
Talk to them the way you talk to me.
You can tell your story, the real one.
In a country where my family cannot even come to watch me die.
No.
No, I would rather end it all.
Right now.
Please, just ask your superiors...
for my family's sake. Please.
Dani's ready for him.
Hey, you're making everyone very nervous.
Talk a walk just round the block, okay?
You check the next one. I'll take a look here.
Hide him, quickly!
[Rafi] Go, go, go.
-Anything? -[man] No.
Peter, help!
-No wonder he hasn't broken. -[Peter] All he knows is my name.
I've just spoken to him. Is it true you give him cigarettes?
[Peter] Yeah.
[laughs] Oh, of course, he wouldn't break.
He's getting room service here, catering to his every whim.
Did you think for even a second what was going to happen, huh?
We're all going to rot in a cell because of you.
-I can get the signature. -Give me a break.
-That's bullshit! -[Hanna] Let him.
-Let him try. -[Aharoni] Bullshit.
Let him try.
[Aharoni] That's nonsense. He's compromised us all again.
Sir, I can do it.
We've got no choice.
[Harel] Get us his signature.
-L'Chaim. -L'Chaim.
-I think you should sign. -Why?
Because I believe you.
Tell them what you told me, about the orders you ignored.
They'll only hear the ones I took.
You and I both know I shall die in Israel.
Don't lie to me, Peter.
Why am I the one guilty for my country's mistakes?
So, you would say what you did to my people was a mistake?
We were told that Germany,
our land of hope and possibility, was being overrun.
-If we were to survive-- -Yes, but there's a line.
And you believe you people have found that line, do you? Funny.
I've heard the rumors, a facility in the Negev Desert.
Do you know a hydrogen bomb rarely asks the age of his victims?
That's not the same and you know it.
You watch, they'll cremate my body.
I don't know. I don't know what they'll do in Israel.
And not everyone will give you the chance to say your peace.
Whom did we take from you, Peter?
Think about your boys.
If you sign, they'll know you told the truth.
That you went to Israel with nothing to hide.
Whom did you lose?
-We lost six million-- -I'm asking about you.
Oh.
She's beautiful.
She was more than my sister.
She was my teacher,
and parent.
My friend.
She had three beautiful children.
May I ask how she died?
We think... in the woods near Lublin.
-I'm afraid I don't-- -I wasn't asking.
Of course.
She would have died...
protecting the little ones. I know that much.
I'm sorry.
I am truly sorry.
May I...
May I ask her name?
-Fruma. -[whispers] Fruma.
Her name was Fruma.
I saw you... watching the trains.
You were counting the wagons with your boy. Ah.
Just like Fruma used to do with her little boy.
The only difference...
is that her boy is dead, and yours is alive.
Are you a family man, Peter?
Maybe one day.
It only gets harder with age. Trust me.
You have a woman, I'd assume, so why no children?
I think you know why.
I think perhaps you worry that the future will look like the past.
I hope that changes... for your sake.
I would like to ask one last thing.
I would like to see my wife again one last time before I die.
If you sign, I'll make sure you see your wife again.
You swear it, Peter?
On Fruma?
On Fruma.
You did it. [laughs]
I'll need to call a friend to bring more pesos.
You can wait at my place. It's nearby. Follow me.
[Carlos] We know you work for the Jews.
If you want us to stop, you must tell me where he is, my dear.
[crying] I don't know. I don't know.
-[shouting] Stop! Stop! Stop! -[screams]
[Klaus] Stop!
My name is Klaus Eichmann.
I just want my father back.
Please.
Help.
Help me and I can make them stop.
[Rafi ] Let's clear the house of all personal items.
Moshe, prep the cars.
-Yaakov, get the luggage ready. -[Yaakov] Okay.
-Oh, where's Graciela? Someone call her. -[Ilani] I'm on it, boss.
[Rafi] Go get Eichmann ready. We leave in one hour. Let's go.
-Okay. Yeah. -[Eichmann] Time to go, is it?
I'll examine you and then I'll give you a shot to relax.
Understood?
Sounds very peaceful.
[Hanna] Sit back.
You remind me of her.
His Fruma.
[Eichmann] I said I couldn't help, but perhaps I can.
Her story, your story,
reminds me of when I was sent east.
General Müller asked I check on the Einsatzgruppen, the morale had dropped. They needed an authority figure...
the morale had dropped. They needed an authority figure... to reinvigorate them.
And, to my mind... [clears throat]
I wondered if I might solve the issue.
Find a less chaotic manner of proceeding other than vans and bullets.
It was horrifying.
Five thousand Jews lined up to stand in this pit.
I had to drink Schnapps to keep from fainting.
I remember a woman and her baby.
She begged for the child's life.
She lifted it up
as if she might give her baby to me, as if I might save it.
I would, on occasion,
do such things, an old acquaintance,
people who might be of use, but this--
[Hanna] Stop talking, please.
Then bang.
[Eichmann] The bullet that killed her goes straight through her child first.
I remember wiping its brains off my jacket.
Do you think that's how we did it, Peter?
[Eichmann] Do you think that's how we killed Fruma?
[Eichmann] One can hope it was that quick.
That they didn't do the things some soldiers do,
but then we'll never know.
[Hanna] Peter, don't listen to him.
[Eichmann] They'll say my death is justice
for all the people you lost.
That makes my life worth six million Frumas.
How does that make you feel, knowing that she's not worth the spit in my mouth?
-Let go of the syringe. Peter! -Do it, for God's sake.
Go on, do it you coward.
-Leave. -[Hanna] Don't. -Make her worth something! -[Peter] Get out.
-Make her worth something! -[Peter] Get out.
-[Hanna] Peter. -Leave.
-Is that what you want? -[shouts] Leave right now!
Come on. Do it!
[Hanna] Rafi!
[Hanna] Get him out. He's ready.
[Rafi] Leave the cars. Out the back.
[Rafi] Moshe, do your thing.
-[Moshe] Yep. -[Peter] I got him.
[Peter] Go around.
[Moshe] Come on. Come on.
[Peter] The car's too small, we're not gonna fit.
[Moshe] Go get in the other car.
-[Peter[ What about you? -[Rafi] There's no room. I'm staying.
[Rafi] I'll find my own way home. Tell me what it was like.
Aharoni.
-I should have-- -[Aharoni] No, no. It's all right.
You got what we needed.
I just thought... I just need him to be there.
I know, me too.
Our slot is in 15 minutes.
You'd better hope your people hurry up.
Don't worry.
-[Ilani in Spanish] Hello, friend. -[security in Spanish] Hi. Passports.
[mumbling in Spanish] Hello, sir.
[Ilani] Too much Fernet... He's a monster on the stuff.
You have no idea.
-[officer in Spanish] All clear. -[Ilani in Spanish] Thank you.
-[officer in Spanish] Goodbye. -[Ilani in Spanish] Goodbye.
[in Spanish] This is Inspector Rega.
[Moshe] Take him up. I'll get rid of the car.
We have to prevent them from flying. Understand?
At your service.
Radio Fuldner! They're at the airport.
[traffic controller] You are clear for landing, 25 right. Winds are two, three, four, and six.
[controller] Three, five, five, eight, five, five. This is Buenos Aires.
-[pilot over radio] -[controller] We have you on radar.
Quickly, strap him in.
Air traffic control. This is El Al 4XAGD. NOTAMS checked.
Our flight path confirmed. Ready for takeoff.
[controller] El Al, slot for you in five. Confirming landing permits now.
Can I speak to you for a moment?
I'm sorry.
I lost it over there.
-No. It's just about you. -You know that I love you.
Your pain.
Your hate.
-It's a long trip. In the air we'll talk. -Okay.
[Peter] What's going on?
-[co-pilot] We have a problem. -[Harel] What?
We have to stop, and I've got to refuel.
We filed a landing permit this morning but they're saying they don't have it.
That's impossible.
[Aharoni] It can't be an accident. What do you want to do?
They're sending someone to collect our copy.
-How long's that gonna take? -Fifteen minutes. Thirty maybe.
What if one of us ran it over, would we be able to get back in time?
[Harel] Can someone from your crew go?
[pilot] I am not leaving any of my crew behind.
I'll go.
Give me the permit.
-Landing permits. El Al. Who do I...? -[controller]Traffic at three o'clock.
Okay. They can go now.
Immediately, or the next slot's in 15 minutes.
-Fifteen minutes. -That gives you time to re-board.
Do it. Send the plane now.
[pilot] Ladies and gentlemen, we have been cleared to take off.
What about Peter?
You know that I have Inspector Rega following behind me,
and when he arrives this friendly conversation is over.
[Klaus shouts] Let go! Let go! My father is on that plane!
[Klaus] Let go!
[Klaus shouts] Let go!
[Ben-Gurion] Ladies and gentlemen of the Knesset,
a short time ago, the most notorious Nazi war criminal,
Adolf Eichmann, responsible with the Nazi leaders
for the extermination of six million of the Jews of Europe,
has been discovered and apprehended.
[Ben Gurion] Adolf Eichmann is already under arrest in Israel.
He will shortly be placed on trial in Jerusalem
under the terms of the law for the trial of Nazis and their helpers.
[Peter] All fixed.
[Mrs. Malkin] Take her with you.
[officer] Ticket.
Identification. Very nice.
Join the back of the line.
-[officer] Tickets. -[Aharoni] Peter.
[Peter] It's quite a line.
[Aharoni] It's all right. I'll help you get in.
[man] I stand here before you, judges of Israel,
to lead the prosecution of Adolf Eichmann,
but I am not standing alone.
With me are six million accusers.
But they cannot rise to their feet, and point toward him who sits in the dock
and cry out, j'accuse!
[man] For their ashes
are piled up on the hills of Auschwitz and in the fields of Treblinka.
Their blood cries out,
but their voice is not heard.
[man] Therefore, today I will be their spokesman.
And in their name, I will unfold the awesome indictment.
The history of the Jewish people is steeped in suffering and tears.
Yet never, down the entire blood-stained road traveled by this people,
[voice fading off] never since the first...
[Rafi] Hey.
They say the only thing Eichmann will talk about
is what the cover of his autobiography's gonna look like.
-You chosen yours yet? -[Rafi] No.
You think Miriam would let me make that decision?
She barely lets me choose breakfast.
You gonna go back in?
I don't know.
[Rafi] You don't have to.
Fruma won't hate you for letting go.
You got him. Remember that.
-Yeah. It wasn't just me, Raf. -[Rafi] Ah.
It doesn't matter anyway. No one's gonna know it was us.

What were Bravo Team traveling in? Up-armored Humvee and a M-ATV.
That's 10 tons of armored vehicle. They don't just disappear.
Boss, we've got something.
Incoming. On your 12.
Where did that come from? Out of nowhere.
Bravo Team reported a storm in their last transmission.
Hostiles using it for cover? An ambush. Like in Helmand?
Let's not find out.
REDCON-1. If there are hostiles hiding behind that storm,
things might get kinetic. Copy that.

Ugh, I'll survive. Did we just get hit by lightning?
Steeler, you good? Never better.
Where did all this sand come from?
ARTEMIS: This isn't right, none of it.
What the hell is that?
I don't see any structures or mountains marked on this map.
According to this, the nearest sand dune is 20 klicks away.
How's that possible? AXE: Where the hell are we?
How did we get so far from the road? I don't know.
Axe, get on one of those dunes
and set up an observation point. Yes, boss.
ARTEMIS: Steeler! DPV will run. She's had worse.
Marshall? GPS is fried, boss.

Go analog. Navigate by the sun.

Up-armored DPV and a M-ATV.
It's Bravo Team.
V-formation. Move out.
What do we do about them? When we get comms,
What do we do about them? When we get comms, we'll call in recovery assets to retrieve the bodies.
What happened to them? Flamethrowers.
I don't think so.
Never seen a flamethrower do this to a man.
Not even napalm burns that hot. Ma'am?
It's glass.
Glass?
When sand melts, it turns to glass.
How do you melt sand?
I don't know.
This shit is officially above my pay grade.
Looks like they made a stand.
Let off a lot of rounds. They didn't hit anything.
There's no bodies.
Maybe they took the bodies with them?
I've seen that before. LINK: Yeah.
Well, that's just the thing. What do you see, Link?
Nothing.
No tracks anywhere.
Whoever did this, they didn't leave a mark.
We need to get moving. Move out!
Dark Star to Falcon. Dark Star to Falcon, over.
Damn it. Lightning really messed up the electronics, huh?
Not just the electronics.

MARSHALL: Captain!
Come on!
MARSHALL: Come on, boss!
MARSHALL: I got it, I got it! Move, move!
Reloading!
What was that thing? What is that?
I told you. I told you. That light, it took us somewhere.
We need to get back. We need to get back home.
Stow it, Sergeant Davis. Oh, God. We're gonna die here.
Shut that shit up right now, soldier. That's an order.
You see what it did to Steeler and Axe? Dash, hey.
I got three. You?
What? Three mags left.
What does it matter? Did you see that?
It matters because we're soldiers. And this is what we do. We fight.
Am I right? Rangers lead the way.
You with me? Always, boss.
You're all crazy.
You know, I don't care what the hell that thing is.
We do what we do best. We fight and we survive.
No matter what the odds. You got it?
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
You got it?
Loud and clear, ma'am.
Now, I got three left. What about you?
Med pack!
CPR, Marshall. On it.
DASH: It's too late. Bullshit!
Don't die on me, Ranger. Come on.
Don't die on me, Ranger. Come on. Lack of pulse. Unacceptable. Try it again.
I'm sorry. Shit! There's more of them!
DASH: Come on! We have to go!
They're everywhere!
I'm sorry.
MARSHALL: Master sergeant!
Link! All right, on me!
[HISSES] LINK: Let's move out!
MARSHALL: Fall back, fall back!
MARSHALL: Dash!
Come on! Keep moving!
[SCREAMS] Marshall!
Go, go, go!
ARTEMIS: Link. [DASH SCREAMS]
Dash.
Dash.
Dash.
LINK: You're alive. Link.
What is it? What is it?
Pain in my chest!
I can't feel my arm. Some sort of poison.
You just gotta work through it. Come on. Let's move. Come on.
[GROANING] Oh, God.
Oh, no.
Captain.
All right, it's just a little further. Let's go.
Ugh! I can't move. Oh!
Okay, let me see.
Let me see what it is. [GROANING]
Go! [GRUNTS]
Oh, my God!
God, Link! No!
You gotta go!
[SCREAMS] Link!
[WHISPERS] Damn you.
[SHOUTS] Damn you!
But I'm coming home.
Nerscylla.
Nerscylla! Get off me.
Nice life you've-- [GROUND RUMBLING]
See how you like it.
Cheers.
Oh! Oh, you spiteful little bastard.
Hey. How about that? [SPEAKS IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]
Yeah. You don't like that, huh? Not so funny now, huh?
I'll kill you.
Come on!
Push! Push!
Here.
I'm not your enemy.
Wait, wait. Wait.
One second. Look. Look.
Here.
Food.
Food. Here. Take it.
Here, give it to me.
Look, look.
Mmm, so good.
Mmm. It's good, right?
Oh, wow.
Heh. Slow down. Okay, it's good.
It's chocolate. Hmm?
Chocolate. Chocolate.
Yeah, chocolate.
Chocolate.
Chocolate.
Choco-- Chocolate!
Chocolate! I don't have any more.
No, no more, no more, no more. Look, look. Nothing.
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKS IN ALIEN LANGUAGE] Oh. Oh, my God. Thank you so much. Oh, my God.
Thank you.
Hey.
Wait! Where are you going?
Wait!
Me and you go out there?
Yes. That lightning, I think that's what brought me here.
I need to go there. I need to get home.
That thing is still out there.
Diablos. Diablos.
Hey, over there...
I have weapons.
Diablos... kssh!
What? [SPEAKS IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]
What? Nerscylla.
No. We don't need to go back in there.
We need to go out there. Diablos.
Diablos. Diablos.
Nerscylla.
Pssh! Diablo...
We poison it.
Smart.
To kill a monster, you need a monster.
But how are we gonna get one of those things?
What?
ARTEMIS: ♪ They say that in the army ♪ ♪ The coffee's mighty fine ♪
♪ It looks like muddy water And tastes like turpentine ♪
♪ Oh, Lord, I wanna go But they don't let me go ♪
♪ They say that in the army The men are mighty fine ♪
♪ To me They look like hunchbacks ♪ ♪ And sound like Frankenstein ♪
♪ Oh, Lord, I wanna go But they won't let me go ♪
Come on!
Yes! Got it!
Next time, you're bait!
"Ranger."
That's me.
Ranger.
Yeah. Yeah.
Hunter.
Hunter. Ranger.
Yeah. Yes. Hunter?
Velcro.
Velcro. Yeah.
[WHISPERS] Velcro. Velcro.
Okay. All right, all right. That's enough. That's enough.
Oh, man.
Really trying to get in here, huh?
Is that your family?
Are you gonna see them? Are you gonna go home?
Home?
I'm sorry.
Rathalos.
Let's do this.
Never mind. Let's go.
Ready!
Yeah! Wow!
What is that? You gotta tell me about that.
You can't just do that to somebody.
Any second now.
Stop!
Bait!
Shit!
Come on!
Watch over him!
You're welcome.
Wow.
Apceros.
Apceros.
Apceros. Yeah.
Okay. Okay. They eat grass.
Water. Water.
Bait.
Bait?
You're funny.
Know what I'm gonna do next time you're dying in the desert?
Nothing.
That smells good.
Catch Cephalos. I'll eat anything at this point.
Home.
Yeah. My way home.
I hope.
Chocolate.
Mmm, chocolate. Mmm.
So good.
What's that?
All right.
Whoo! Whoo! Chocolate.
No, no, no.
Chocolate. Not chocolate.
What's going on? Rathalos.
You said that before. What the hell is a Rathalos?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't thank me yet.
Enjoying the show?
[IN ALIEN LANGUAGE] This one must have come from the sky.
What?
[MEOWS] What is that?
Palico.
My friend tells me I misjudged you...
that I might even owe you an apology.
Just don't hold your breath.
Why did you put me in chains?
What are you so afraid of?
Your world...
and what it could do to mine.
You aren't the first to cross over from your world. There were others.
A long time ago.
That's how you speak my language?
Mmm, I made a study of it. What happened to me?
How did I get here?
I believe that the answers we both seek lie here.
At the peak of that mountain lies the Sky Tower.
Remnants of an ancient civilization.
Very advanced. Very dangerous.
It is said that the Ancients knew how to travel between both worlds.
I believe that is the purpose of the Sky Tower.
That is what brought you here.
What happened to this ancient civilization?
They destroyed themselves. Their technology turned on them.
You think my world had something to do with it.
I suspect. But an open gateway between our two worlds
was catastrophic once.
I intend to make sure that doesn't happen again.
We were on our way to investigate the Sky Tower
when we strayed into the Diablos.
That's where I lost my friend here.
Tending to the wounded and repairing the ship was our first priority.
But now we resume our mission.
The Ancients would guard their technology with the most fearsome of creatures,
a Rathalos.
Almost impossible to kill.
Their only weakness is just before they breathe fire.
You help us with the battle ahead, perhaps we can help you get home.
What's the matter?
You don't have cats in your world?
Hey!
You been drinking from my mug again?
We leave at dawn.
And don't keep me waiting.
I hate waiting.
So? You ready?
We got a hard climb ahead of us.
LEA: Come on!
We believe that the lava powers the machinery within the tower.
It's controlling the storm.
Exactly.
It's creating a gateway to your world, but it looks unstable.
Let's go.
[IN ALIEN LANGUAGE] It's glass.
Rathalos.
Prepare yourself. Remember, they're weak just before they breathe fire.
Hey, ugly!
It's okay! It's okay. You're safe now! Get the medic!
Captain Artemis?
Let's get her inside! Up!
Let's go! Let's go!
[DISTORTED] Captain, we've been searching for you.
What the hell is she wearing?
Falcon Main, this is Red Wolf.
PILOT [OVER RADIO]: We've made contact with Dark Star.
We have a lone survivor.
I say again, a lone survivor. Ground forces are securing the area.
Copy that, Red Wolf.
Captain.
Can you hear me?
[ECHOING] Can you hear me?
Captain?
Captain Artemis?
Where are the rest of your men?
My men? Yes.
[IN REGULAR VOICE] Where are the rest of Alpha Team?
OFFICER [OVER RADIO]: Copy that.
ROARK: We're under attack!
Aim for the belly!
THE ADMIRAL: A Rathalos.
Load!
Fire!
No! No!
No!
It's coming right for us!
Evade!
OFFICER [OVER RADIO]: We're on Channel 5. Interference is...
My God.
Come on!
I got you.
My friend.
[IN ALIEN LANGUAGE] Thought you might need a little help.
Yeah, I...
still don't understand you, man.
Oh, yeah.
Friends.
Yeah, thank you.
I don't have any more chocolate.
Think fast.
You're here. We came to help.
We can't have monsters from my world attacking yours.
It's starting again.
We don't have much time.
There's going to be another attack.
We have to get back.
"THAT IS NOT DEAD WHICH CAN ETERNAL LIE. AND WITH STRANGE EONS EVEN DEATH MAY DIE."
There was nothing I could do.
We can't bury him here.
30 YEARS LATER
The Canaanite languages, as well as the Aramaic and Ugaritic,
are all part of the subgroup
of northern occidental Semitic languages.
Okay.
That's all for today.
We'll meet again next week.
How did it go?
Could you give me some money? I'm on my way out.
Where?
I'm having dinner with Diego, and we're going to a bar after that.
Camila, weren't we having dinner together?
But it's Saturday.
Spending a Saturday with your family won't kill you.
We can spend the day together tomorrow.
We can go to the... mall.
We'll have dinner at home, and then you can leave, okay?
-Can I invite Diego? -Sure.
Okay, you tell him.
-Hi. -Hi, ma'am.
-How are you, Diego? -Fine.
-Would you like to come over for dinner? -Yes, I'd love to.
Great, I'll go with Diego and I'll see you there.
Okay.
Bye.
Doctor, we received a manuscript from Durango.
Could you come and see it?
Can't it wait till Monday?
I doubt you'd want to wait.
This must be the oldest manuscript I've ever seen.
I can't believe how well preserved it is.
Who-- Who brought it, and for what purpose?
It was delivered by a messenger.
Has anyone else seen it yet?
No.
Please, tell the doctor
that I'll have a detailed summary as soon as possible.
-I'll take it with me. -Okay.
Thank you.
I'm home!
What the--
Son of a...
Are you going to work?
It's urgent, but it's not an emergency.
And the girls?
In their rooms.
And dinner?
-Luis. -Yes?
Dinner?
It's almost ready, sweetheart.
Please, don't leave that in the living room.
Yes, honey.
Fernanda, watch out!
What's that?
Work. Nothing special.
Sure, Mom. I believe you.
Hey, I'm serious.
I don't like you going through my things, okay?
Whatever you say, boss.
Sorry, I didn’t know you were here.
Don't worry. What's up?
Nothing, it's just that
I wanted to show you something from...
-I'll be right there. -Yes, yes.
No, wait.
Don't you want to?
Yes, but it's kind of weird when my family is here, too.
What if my dad opens the door?
What's that?
I'm sorry. I didn't want to-- I didn't know you two were--
It was nothing.
Did you guys do it already?
No.
-Why so slow? -You walked in on us.
No, I'm kidding.
-I don't want it to happen here. -Where, a hotel, then?
Am I interrupting?
No, no, never, no.
In fact, I was showing this book to Camila.
Very interesting. Mom brought it today.
What's this?
It looks like the Necronomicon.
What's a Necronomicon?
It's a book of rituals to invoke the Ancients.
The Book of the Dead, have you heard--
It's fiction.
Lovecraft made it up in his stories, back in the '20s.
That's what you think.
Did you invoke the Ancients?
Obviously.
-How many? -Five.
-Did you hook up with any? -Obviously.
Have you done any of the rituals?
No, I thought about doing them, but it's too complicated.
It's just to have fun. You're taking it too seriously.
No! Hey, everything can and should be subjected to the scientific method.
Otherwise, you'd believe in all kinds of nonsense.
-It could be demonstrated. -What if we give it a try?
That way, we can see whether it's true or not.
I like that idea.
Okay.
-We must hold each other's hands. -Candles?
Come on, cut the crap.
-What language is this? -Latin.
I don't speak Latin.
Let me see.
Read it already.
"I hereby offer my body
as a vessel for darkness, Ctulhu.
And with these words,
I state you have been great, Cthylla, daughter of Ctulhu--"
Holy shit!
Wow!
No fucking way!
This way, please.
Good afternoon, to all of you.
My name is Karl Nüni.
Thank you for coming, Father.
I'm not a priest.
What should I call you, then?
You've locked her up.
Please, don't hurt my mother.
She's old.
Guadalupe Rodríguez, are you here?
Demon, show yourself.
I am your God.
Open the door, Father, open!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom! What did you do to her, asshole?
-Mom! -Mommy.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Does it hurt?
That'll be enough.
May the Lord repay you, Father.
What's up, white boy?
Did the price go up?
No, it's all there.
Bullshit, Jorge.
I can get you some more if you want. Just forget about it.
Go in peace, child.
I hear you.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
Tell me, child.
Child?
Don't you want to know how it went?
You're alive. That answers the question.
Where are you going?
Everybody needs to get rid of their own demons.
How did it go with the family? Okay?
I'm wiped out.
What about a little pick-me-up?
In the end, it was good for both of us, right?
You will never understand, unless...
To each his own.
You wouldn't understand it either.
Unless...
Hey...
Karl...
Don't remain in the darkness.
Enjoy it.
ROME, ITALY, GERMANY
Fernanda?
What's up? I thought I told you not to.
Sorry, I won't do it again.
We're leaving, Dad.
Perfect.
You look great!
-Call me if you need anything, okay? -Yes.
-Have a great time. Bye. -Bye.
Romina!
-How are you? -Fine, and you?
How are you?
Are we still going camping?
Let's get something to drink.
-Three tequilas? -Tequila.
Three tequilas, please!
No tequila? Just water.
-One water. -One water.
Hey, what the hell? We're in line!
-She's feeling sick. -I don't give a shit, get in line!
-Shut up, bitch! -I don't give a shit.
-Camila! -Hey!
Are you okay?
Hey.
Hey, are you okay?
Hey.
What are you doing?
What?
Let's go.
Hi! Good morning.
I want some.
-Don't burn yourself! -No.
-Morning. -Morning!
Hi.
-Is it ready? -Yes, I'll serve you now.
It smells delicious. Thanks.
What?
Hey, go get your sister.
It's good.
Camila, breakfast's ready.
Camila.
Hey, come on, wake up.
Do you want me to bring you breakfast?
Camila...
Camila.
Are you okay?
Cami? Honey?
Come on, get up.
Let me sleep, it's Sunday.
Sunday? No!
It's Monday already. You've been sleeping for more than a day.
-Are you serious? -Yes, I am.
I don't know how much you drank, but I hope you learned your lesson.
Are you feeling okay? Or should I take you to the doctor?
No.
No to what? Shall we go to the doctor's?
No, I'm fine.
-Really? -Yes, I'm waking up.
Okay, go take a shower.
Your mom needs to leave soon, hurry up.
Okay.
Am I your favorite?
Hey, are we still going on vacation?
We are, but I don't know about you. Your grades say the opposite.
Damn!
I thought you were smart people,
but your faith in our education system is blind.
In my opinion, it's pretty mediocre.
If you don't agree, you can move to... Finland.
Deal. Will you pay my ticket?
I know what, I'm going to drop my Anthropology major
and become a TV actress.
I have to go.
And Camila?
She won't have time for breakfast.
Call an ambulance!
Camila!
What's wrong?
Hello?
We have an emergency.
-Camila! -My daughter is unconscious!
She's not breathing!
-Easy, easy. -Camila...
Dad, her hand.
-What? -What happened?
What's that?
Hey, white boy.
You're screwed. Give me everything you have.
Hurry up!
Didn't you hear me? Come on!
Quickly!
You think you're tough?
Do it.
What the fuck?
We didn't find any cognitive damage from the fall.
No virus or bacteria that may have caused the illness.
In my opinion, this can all be related to the amount of alcohol she consumed.
Also, we found traces of methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
better known as ecstasy.
I wanted to try it, I took one.
Do you really think that could be the cause
of her sleeping for two days straight, vomiting, or losing her balance?
It could be, but it's not likely.
-Depression? -I'm not depressed.
It could be stress.
In any case, we'll do additional tests for Camila.
Take her home, she needs to rest.
-Let's go. -I can do it myself.
Okay.
-Thank you. -Bye. Thank you.
Cami...
How are you?
Are you feeling sick?
What did the doctor say?
Should I bring you some food?
We can eat here in bed, like when we were kids.
What? I didn't get that.
I said no! Leave me the fuck alone!
Camila, are you okay?
Nothing.
Come.
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine. Get out.
We can meet at my place next time, if you want.
Don't come back.
We won't see each other again.
Camila?
Camila?
PRIEST, EXORCIST, MEXICO
THERE ARE NO AUTHORIZED PRIESTS IN MEXICO
CLANDESTINE EXORCIST PRIEST MEXICO
I need to talk to you.
And the door opened on its own,
and she was on the other side of the room, sound asleep.
Okay, I understand.
No, no, you don't. That wasn't my sister!
Look, I know this doesn't necessarily have anything to do with Catholicism,
but there was nobody else from any other religion
but there was nobody else from any other religion willing to help me.
Right.
Hollywood movies are to blame for that.
If you really want to help her, you should take her to see a doctor.
We did take her to a doctor!
He said there was nothing wrong with her.
What is that book like?
It's more of an ancient manuscript, it's in Latin.
-Is it an ecclesiastic book? -No.
It has symbols like the ones of the Necronomicon--
-Necronomicon? -Yes.
Are you sure?
Yes, they're symbols very similar to Sumerian ones.
It's like the Necronomicon. I know about this.
Bring it over so I can see it.
So, are you going to help my sister?
If what you say is true,
the first thing I need to do is figure out what we're up against.
I need to see the manuscript, and your sister, of course.
Okay, let's go.
Wait, not so fast.
This type of thing takes time.
I need to study it closely.
Are you an exorcist or not?
Celtic, right?
No, it's sacred geometry.
It's my sister's.
Camila.
-Hi, Diego. -Hi.
-Are you fucking a priest? -Cut the bullshit, this is important.
I'm Tomás.
-Diego. Nice to meet you. -Pleased to meet you, Diego.
Should we sit down?
Please.
Camila,
you know why I'm here, right?
Have you been feeling unwell lately?
Camila!
It can be difficult to understand what's happening to you.
You need help to get over this.
And you're the help?
-That's why I'm here. -I see.
Do you see the evil in my face, wretched soul?
Now, little human.
What's your name?
What's your name?
What's your name, demon?
What's your name, demon?
Hi.
What's going on?
I'm Father Tomás.
With all due respect, I wasn't talking to you.
Cecilia.
Okay, let me explain.
-If you'd allow me, ma'am. -Doctor. De la Cueva.
Dr. De La Cueva,
we believe Camila has a serious problem.
Sorry.
Luis Miranda.
If what you're saying is true,
do you believe you're qualified to help her with her problem?
Dad, give him a chance.
Your daughter Fernanda came to see me with this.
I'm working on it.
I'm a philologist.
This manuscript is the key to open doors that should remain closed.
Without a doubt, it's one of a kind.
And I see it was written with a specific reason.
However, I'm certain that words
written by the hands of a simple human, like you or me,
can't affect physically the person who reads them.
You wouldn't say that if you saw what we just saw.
Yes? What did you see?
Camila.
Aren't you going to say anything?
I don't know what's going on with you, Fernanda.
Fernanda, what did you see?
Her eyes became completely black, Dad!
She started speaking in Latin!
Excuse me, where are you going with that? Let me explain.
I don't need any of your explanations.
Okay.
Dude, speak up! You also saw it!
Tell them what you saw!
Why aren't you talking? Say something!
I'm not crazy!
-Calm down. -All I want is for Camila to get better!
Give me the manuscript and leave my house, or I'll call the police.
Okay.
Be careful, ma'am.
Keep it away from Camila.
Honey, we can talk to the doctor tomorrow and get the tests done early.
Or we can get another specialist. Whatever you want, okay?
The...
Tomás? He had to go.
Good night.
We'll go to the doctor tomorrow, okay?
You'll feel better once you get some rest--
Really, Dad? Rest?
Diego, do you need me to take you home? Or is someone picking you up?
I'll get a cab.
See you later, then. Be safe.
Dad...
Fernanda, we agreed, we'll get the tests done tomorrow, okay?
And one more thing, please, don't touch my jigsaw puzzle.
Father, what's up?
Fine, child.
-Are you feeling all right? -Yes. Thank you.
I'll see you Sunday, then.
Goodbye.
We need to talk.
Can you contact your provider?
I've never felt like this before.
In all my years of...
There's something wrong, Tomás.
I hope I won't have to use this soon.
I need help, but not that yet.
Does that book mean anything to you?
I'm not sure, but I've seen it before.
I don't know where.
The person who read it...
I think you should meet her. I can't expose myself now.
I need to know what's going on with me.
What's going on with you...
I think it has something to do with that book,
and that girl.
That book...
Where is it?
I'll help you, but I need you to help me first.
I can't take it anymore.
Where is it?
Karl, please.
I can't take it anymore, help me.
Help me, please!
Where is it, you fucking addict?
Karl...
HOLY BIBLE
Ythogtha!
I'm sorry, Tomás.
I'm sorry.
Doctor?
Yes, Camila?
I can't do it, I don't feel good.
Hold on a little longer, it's just a few seconds.
Camila!
Camila, are you okay?
Camila!
Camila!
Camila! Breathe!
Camila!
I can't find any medical reason for what could be affecting Camila.
Which is why I think it must be stress.
Is that possible in someone so young?
Well, yes.
Given the circumstances, it's possible.
-Do you feel stressed? -Yes, but that's not causing this!
What's causing it, then?
We need to talk to the priest.
What for?
You've already tried, I'm not possessed.
I'm not saying you are, or that he needs to do an exorcism,
but he said he knew someone who could help us.
Camila, something bad is happening to you.
It's no joke.
Okay.
I have an idea, wait for me.
THE BOOK OF THE DEAD
SPELL AGAINST THE ANCIENTS
Are you okay?
Calm down.
What's your name?
Karl.
Everything will be all right, Karl. Don't worry.
Karl.
Karl.
Karl!
Are you all right?
What are you doing here?
Why do you look better?
I hate it when you hide my medicine, but I also love you for it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.
I hate to admit it,
but you're the most important thing in my life.
I hope you value what I just said, because I'll never say it again.
Let's go.
We need to help that girl.
Why do you care about it so much?
For the same reason you do.
Besides, a father has to take care of the demons inside his own child.
Are you going to leave me with my hand out?
That's the house.
What do you think you're here for?
To save myself.
Ythogtha.
Where is she?
-Is that him? -The only one that can save her.
Don't you recognize me? Camila?
Everyone, get out of the house.
Now!
Let's go.
Let's go.
I'll tell you something.
This is the end...
for Ythogtha.
Cthylla.
No, Fernanda.
Why are they silent? What is he doing to her?
Don't worry. Karl has done this many times before.
Then why do you look so worried?
-You again? -You can't go in.
Where's Camila?
She's with a friend of Tomás.
Ma'am, it's dangerous.
-Excuse me. -Please.
Camila!
What happened?
If I were you, I wouldn't get so close to her.
And who are you?
Hang up.
You can't come to my house, uninvited,
and give me orders.
I'm not playing.
Me neither.
Get out of my house!
Fernanda, take Camila to her room.
Careful.
We'll leave, but before we do, there's something you need to hear.
The fraternal bond that I have with Cthylla
is only biological, so to speak.
As I was never recognized by my father, he seeks to destroy--
Your father?
What on earth are you talking about?
And what does that have to do with my daughter?
Camila has been possessed by Cthylla...
but her soul and destiny haven't bonded fully with that of the demon's.
I can still save her, but we don't have much time.
These forces predate humankind.
It's difficult to understand them fully.
Even when--
Cami, no!
Camila!
-Camila! -No!
Cecilia, don't!
Karl, I'm waiting for your signal.
Not now, Tomás!
Ceci!
Ceci! Cecilia!
Cecilia!
Mom?
Take him out.
And her sister?
Leave her.
No, no...
Let's go.
No, Cecilia...
Cecilia...
Camila.
Come here.
Goodbye, brother!
Tomás, now!
Now!
Do it!
Tomás, now!
Tomás, please!
It feels like it will never stop raining.
Help me.
I only have you.
And I only have you.
Everything will be all right.
Dear Lord,
through your only son, defeater of death,
you have opened today the doors to eternal life.
Allow those who celebrate the solemnity of the Lord's resurrection
to resurrect also in the light of the eternal life
by the renovating act of your spirit,
through our Lord Jesus Christ, your son, who lives and reigns with you,
in unity with the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
NETFLIX PRESENTS
Good evening, sir.
Welcome.
I need a room.
That'll be 40 dollars.
For five more, you get a room with a TV.
There are also very classy women that could pay you a visit.
It's really delicious.
It reminds me of mom.
I'm worried about you.
You have nothing to worry about.
I'll be fine.
So you're not letting it go?
At your service, sir.
What can I do for you?
I'm looking for a woman. She's with an 18-year-old girl.
Her name is Julia.
Do you know her surname? No.
But I heard they've been staying here for a while.
I think I know them.
Room 175.
May I ask about the people in that room?
That mustache looks good on you.
You must be careful,
because the singing girl is in there.
She'd better not hear you.
Please, let me go! -Where is he? -I don't know who you're talking about.
-Where is he? -I don't know who you're talking about.
-Don't play the fool. Tell me where he is! -I don't know him!
You're not going anywhere! Come with me, damn it!
Let me go, please! I don't know him.
Take me to him right now! Where is he?
I don't know!
My room is on the first floor.
Will you check my foot?
Nothing's broken.
I was hoping for a sign.
And you showed up.
Will you pour me a drink?
For the pain.
I'm very grateful to you.
If you hadn't showed up...
who knows what would've happened.
My name is Rubí.
You'll never forget it.
And yours...
angel of the night?
My name is Franco.
I knew you'd come for me...
Franco.
You're talking nonsense.
I can tell that you don't have many friends around here.
You should come visit me.
I work 15 minutes away, on foot.
You can go to the reception and ask...
for the Eclipse Bar.
Last time, there was a rat's nest inside the sewage.
We had to fill it with acid.
Find her.
Find out where she is.
Do you know where she is?
Help me find her, please.
Help me.
I've told you a thousand times not to come up here.
There's strange people.
And it's too desolate. Wait, I have to talk to her.
You want to speak with the girl?
You'll have to wait for the full moon.
That's in two weeks.
It'll cost you $2,000.
And I warn you, whether you get what you need or not,
you'll have to pay up front.
Stop your noise.
The girl and I have been waiting for you.
You look a lot like a lover I once had.
He was a very troubled young man.
Come on in.
Let me pour you a welcome drink.
There's no such thing as a coincidence.
If you've come to this door, there's a reason for it.
Affinity and magnetism are trying to tell us something.
You look pale.
You should get out of here while you can.
Don't feel sorry for me. I've lived a full life.
When my time comes, I won't be scared.
DARK FORCES
This is my favorite book.
I wrote it many years ago.
Take it.
I won't pay you a cent for this.
You'll only be borrowing it.
I can help you...
if you let me.
How much will that help cost?
Everyone comes looking for the girl.
But she whispers to few.
Hi there!
My love!
Where are you going so lonely?
You could get lost.
It's so nice of you to come looking for me.
I found the place by accident.
It may not seem like it...
but deep down, you're a gentleman.
You respect people.
That's uncommon these days.
I'm not this way with just anyone.
Do you have a family?
A wife?
Kids?
No.
I was married once.
Let's say it didn't work out.
But I'm eager to fall in love again.
You're wasting your time.
I think you've never been loved.
Don't you know what love means?
When I start loving you...
you won't stop thinking about me.
You need me as much as I need you.
The time is near.
Who's there?
Strange noises were coming from the hallway.
They seemed to be coming from here.
She seems to be in pain.
You're wrong.
It's pleasure.
Diva and I have a complicated relationship.
She just took her dose.
It's better if she sleeps.
She enjoys it more that way.
What do you know about the psychic girl?
If you let me live within you...
you'll be able to meet with her in your dreams.
In the city of the eternal night.
If you're not prepared...
the plans will soon be over.
If you want me to blow you away, you'll have to pay me.
You and I come from the darkest side of nature,
so go and do your job.
You should think of Mom more.
I understand it's a hunting night.
If you can bring me a souvenir,
I'll appreciate it.
The revolver fits my hand perfectly.
I'm glad you're starting your job.
I want to help you.
You won't stop following me, right?
If they catch you, I won't be able to help you.
Don't hesitate.
And don't get us killed.
This is a heist!
If you cooperate, you won't die.
On the floor!
The stuff on the table.
Put your valuables on the table.
Heads down! What are you looking at?
Move!
My watch.
-No, not the watch. -Give it to me!
No, please!
Is that what you want?
Cooperate!
Stay down!
Don't move!
The way you say things...
with that violent tone.
One can tell how strong you are.
It's the only way to make them respect you.
If you act weak...
you'll end up dead.
You must be willing to do anything.
It's either you...
or them.
That idiot...
jeopardized our entire future.
You did what you had to do.
We won't do this again.
I can't risk...
getting locked up...
or killed.
Where's the loot bag?
I've always wanted to carry out a robbery.
I feel the adrenaline running through my body.
Let's make a circle.
Hold hands.
Focus on the image.
I ask for permission to lend this body
only to the invoked spirit.
Quiet!
Franco,
come to 53, Rochester Street.
Hold her!
Rochester Street.
The person you're looking for is alive, but in pain.
You'll have to come back. My girl needs to rest.
ROCHESTER STREET
She's not here anymore, Franco. You're too late, as always.
Where's Max?
I guess you'll have to take me to him.
We're going for Sonia.
Move and I'll kill you.
Hands behind your back.
Sonia!
I told you she was in a more comfortable place.
Run!
Was a girl named Sonia here? Tall, dark and slender.
They took her away hours ago.
Are you looking for me, Franco?
Search no more.
Give Sonia back to me.
The only way to pay for your treason
is with your death.
You want Sonia back? Then you'll have to come work for me again.
I made you a lot of money, I saved your life.
We're even.
No one walks out of here without my permission and you know it.
Go fuck yourself, Franco!
Do you know her?
No.
Did you find who you were looking for? Not yet.
You're leaving soon.
I need to get going.
That's terrifying.
Those screams again.
There are many lunatics and addicts wandering around this hotel.
You don't belong here.
I think you like playing the victim...
suffering.
Like with the man in black.
You don't know what I've been through.
The pain I've felt.
It follows me wherever I go.
A ghost embraces me every night.
I'd like to go with you.
I travel alone.
I don't understand why.
Don't underestimate me.
I know how to survive too.
We can't be together.
In crime, whoever has your back today, stabs you tomorrow.
You're wrong.
Together, we could do bigger heists.
And love each other forever.
You've no need to do this.
I'm willing to do anything to change my life.
Then leave.
Go far away.
He has too much power.
He's taken all the hope in my life.
Who is he?
I'm trapped.
I know I need to leave this place to feel better.
Take me away from here.
Please.
I feel I'm going crazy.
Watching my life go by in this place.
LOBBY
Dirty sheets, sir?
I'll help you take them out.
Let's hurry, Franco.
"I've traveled through the spheres, crossed the portals,
descended to the abyss and ascended to the mountains,
walked the seas.
The wind lords whirl around me.
The earth lords crawl, full of wrath, at my feet."
Now I live inside your flesh.
You'll know what happens both here and there.
I hold the secrets you're looking for.
The fate that awaits you is in my throat.
Our deal has been sealed.
I'll guide you
along the path of shadows.
Thank you. You saved me.
I've been his slave for years.
He's one of Max's hitmen.
I don't know what you're talking about.
All I know is...
a group of hitmen came to the hotel.
They took some people.
They took psychic girl too.
What do you know about them?
I've had enough.
I'm leaving with...
or without you.
You're going to tell me how you met him.
They have my sister.
The psychic girl was helping me find her.
I know a warehouse south of the city.
Take me there...
right now.
The warehouse in the back.
That's where they keep the girls.
It's time to go our separate ways.
You need to leave this place now.
Good luck.
I hope you find her.
Finally, Franco.
It's time to settle this once and for all.
I'll kill you with my bare hands.
I gave you a chance, Max.
Now, I'll kill you.
Franco,
here's a proposal.
Let's start a new organization, you and I.
You won't escape this time.
Give me Sonia.
Sonia!
Sonia!
You're free.
They'll come back someday.
I'll always protect you.
You always protected me.
Now we'll be together forever.
Franco...
tragedy is your fate.
Let's get out of here.
I'm okay.
You get out of here.
-Sonia, let's go. -I'll take care of it. Take her, please.
Let's go.
Where did you leave your intuition to smell danger, -Franco? -Evil has drunk from your blood.
-Franco? -Evil has drunk from your blood.
You'll be next.
Don't! That is her room. This is mine!
-Good night! -Hush!
I will be right back.
Chetan Bhagat!
Oh!
The Perks of Being a Wallflower! You read it?
The Perks of Being a Wallflower! You read it? I read the book. Watched the film. And I am one!
What are you? A wallflower or a perk?
You are a wallflower, aren't you?
You find yourself a corner. Hear and see everything but never do anything. I need to do something.
but never do anything. I need to do something.
You read Sophie Kinsella?
I tried but couldn't finish.
Why? It's too difficult Natasha asked me to read it.
It's too difficult Natasha asked me to read it.
You understood Wallflower and not Kinsella?
That was an easy read.
-A wallflower or a fly, it's the same. -Wow!
You are smart!
What's wrong? Is this your first time?
-Really? -Yes.
Let me teach you.
Tea?
What happened last night...
was good, right? -Yes. -Yes.
It was natural, right?
Don't ruin it by talking about it.
Don't talk about it.
I shouldn't have.
-You won't fall in love, right? -No.
Don't overthink it.
Mihir told me that guys
tend to get emotional after sex and they fall in love.
They become possessive.
Sure.
What is it? Why are you smiling?
Do we share a secret? Do we?
I was 26
when I got married to Mihir.
He was 12 years older than me.
I had never dated anyone.
But Mihir had dated many girls.
So marrying a much older guy was an adventure for me.
My parents were against it. He had so many stories to share! Like he went somewhere,
He had so many stories to share! Like he went somewhere, met a girl there, and they started talking.
met a girl there, and they started talking.
met a girl there, and they started talking. His stories were straight out of a movie.
I didn't have any of that.
We talked and he made me understand
that I will resent him
if I did not live my life on my terms.
He urged me to examine my life.
She had a lover, Imroze, who was younger than her.
Draupadi lived with five Pandavas. She loved them and perhaps, they loved her too.
They did not fight over her.
I'm married and I cannot be with anyone else.
What if I fantasize about someone? It's not okay.
How can you expect so much from a person?
You want him to be your best friend, your lover and your wildest fantasy.
What do I do?
It's good that they are finally speaking out.
But how can they prove it? People play the victim card for publicity.
Did you read this?
The husband divorced her as soon as he learned of it.
Things like that happen there often. But it's wrong. It's not okay.
But it's wrong. It's not okay.
What is the student's age?
-He is 18. -So he is an adult.
-Does that justify it? -No matter how old he is...
-But he is an adult! -How do you know it was consensual?
His silence means it was not consensual.
-Tejas Bhave? -Yes. I need to talk to you.
Don't you think she is weird?
Listen! How old are you?
Why? -Just tell me your age! -21.
-Just tell me your age! -21. -Sure? -Yes.
Does your admission form say that?
-No. -People often do that.
-I'm not sure. -Come on! -Do you have your birth certificate? -Yes.
Get it for me.
Take it from the college office.
How can I go and ask for it? What if they ask me why?
Why do you need it?
Listen.
What happened that night
was consensual, right?
What do you mean?
Did I force you to have sex?
No. But...
What?
You made the first move!
Did you say no?
-No. -Exactly.
So, it was consensual, right?
Say it. Say that it was consensual.
Say it. Say that it was consensual. What do I say?
Say that it was consensual.
-What is that word? -Consensual!
Yes. Say it. It was.
"Whatever happened between us was consensual."
-Whatever happened between us... -Yes...
-Was consensual! -Was consensual.
-Say it in one go. -The complete statement?
-Yes. -Whatever...
Say this. "Whatever happened between us," "Ms. Kalindi, was consensual."
-Whatever... -"This is Tejas. Ms. Kalindi..."
"Whatever happened between us was consensual."
Ms. Kalindi, this is Tejas. Whatever happened between us...
-Was all... -That was all consensual!
Now say it properly!
Ms. Kalindi, whatever happened between us was consensual.
-I am Tejas. -Okay.
It's my fault! They have to hit me if I go home late.
Just go home. Shut the door. Play some nice music.
Wash your hands
Think of Hrithik Roshan and have a good time.
Now look at that girl. I said masturbation and she hid her face!
-Ms. Kalindi! -I came by to apologize.
-Ms. Kalindi! -I came by to apologize. Why?
I recorded your statement and scared you.
No. I did not understand anything. What was that word?
Forget it.
-Listen, now we're friends, okay? -Yes.
As in real friends... who share everything.
Okay.
-But without benefits. -What do you mean?
I mean I have a boyfriend now.
-Professor Neeraj! -Yes.
-The Mathematics professor? -Yes.
-Have you seen his hair? -Cool, right?
He isn't like the other guys.
He is faithful. Do you know what he says?
Did you know that penguins are monogamous
and that helps them survive in the extreme cold?
He wants me to be only his.
And he doesn't find me weird. Unlike what your Natasha feels.
-My Natasha? -Yes!
I know everything.
I love Mihir and I love Tejas too.
If I love Tejas and Neeraj as well...
I will not hold myself back.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where the hell are you?
What happened?
-What happened? -You tell me!
You said it was urgent.
I took care of it.
-So easily? -It's not working out with Neeraj.
What happened?
I thought he was smart! Intelligent!
That he knows everything.
But not chemistry.
He doesn't know how to make a move.
It took him 17 days, 16 hours and 32 minutes to say...
I asked him the same question.
Wait!
-Do you have a condom? -In the drawer next to you.
-Should I wear it? -No.
-What happened? -Nothing!
What happened?
Found it!
-Answer it. -It's alright.
-Who called? -I don't know.
-Was it Natasha? -No.
So are you guys together?
It's over.
Really?
Did you have sex with her yet?
No.
Liar.
Why do you care?
-Don't I share my stories with you? -Do I ask you to?
You just vomit it all out.
What's happening between you and Natasha?
Nothing.
Now that you and Professor Neeraj have broken up,
should we...
No?
Did you come here to text?
Give me your phone.
Passcode, please.
I have forgotten it.
Type the passcode.
See. I don't remember it.
Collect it from the office.
I am leaving.
Are you guys studying?
You sit with Rahul in the classroom,
with Akash in the cafeteria.
And now, you are with Tejas.
Your parents live in Dubai...
but they send you money, right?
Do you live alone?
Why did you do that?
Is she your girlfriend?
No.
Oh!
Mihir, can you hear me?
No one is ever honest with anyone.
Even my parents were not honest with each other!
No one is!
Although Mihir was with me, I was feeling guilty.
Why do I feel guilty?
What makes me feel that way?
You must love selflessly.
Mihir loves me like that.
Nothing!
Where are you?
-No! -I know you are dating Natasha. Where are you?
Tell me.
You are, aren't you?
Tell me!
-Go to sleep. Good night. -Tell me...
Mihir and I...
He calls me up and tells me everything.
I'm going to tell the truth too.
Something happened between Tejas and me.
We had something special. So we owe this to each other.
I told him
about my affair with Neeraj.
I told him everything.
I told him when I got fed up.
I cannot be Mihir.
But Tejas lied to me when I asked him about them.
He lied to me.
I don't like being lied to.
He shouldn't have lied.
Tejas!
Tejas?
He's inside.
Tejas!
Tejas!
Open up!
Open the door!
Come on!
Tejas. Please open the door!
Are you listening?
-Grandma? -Tejas.
Open the door!
Who is in there?
That crazy girl!
She just ran inside.
Open the door!
What are you guys up to?
-Whose is this? -I don't know.
Whose is this?
-I don't know! -Is it Natasha's?
No.
-I'm asking for the last time! Is it hers? -How can it be hers?
-Why not? She may have forgotten it here. -I don't know whose it is.
-Oh, really? -Yes.
-Oh, really? -I said I don't!
I will hit you!
-Don't you know? -No.
Don't you? Wait.
-Don't break that! -Why not?
-It's expensive. -How much is it?
Fifty five thousand rupees.
How will I watch Raj Kapoor's movies?
I know you are sleeping with her.
I will catch you red-handed, one day.
You like Boomerang, isn't it?
You kiss like a child.
Eat her, why don't you? You are lying to me.
You text her in my class. You were glued to each other at the Comedy Club!
Do you think I'm blind?
Did you play Raj Kapoor's songs for her as well?
You did, right?
Don't mock me!
I didn't realize
you would be so hurt.
She is just using you!
She is just showing-off. On Instagram, Twitter... She wants to show-off.
On Instagram, Twitter... She wants to show-off.
She is using you like an Instagram filter.
You are the filter today.
Tomorrow, it will be Rahul.
Don't laugh.
You should break up with her.
Do what you want.
-I didn't realize you would be hurt. -Why are you repeating yourself?
I didn't realize you loved me so much.
I want to be with you.
-I will leave her for you. -Have you lost it?
I'm married!
Please hand me a towel.
Not going to shower?
Dirty bitch!
Naked dog!
How are you, Sudha?
-All good? -Yes.
Bless you.
You look very pretty.
Ajit said you are taking good care of the house. -There are fragile things in that. -Okay.
Okay?
The house is very clean.
-Do you need anything? -First, I will take a shower.
Take it.
It's so humid here!
-Sudha! Put the water heater on. -Okay.
Listen, should I give her these?
-Give her one. -Okay.
Keep this bag inside.
This is for you.
Okay?
Come.
Close the left nostril and inhale using the right nostril.
Now close the right nostril and exhale using the left nostril.
Again, close the right nostril and inhale through the left nostril.
Now close the left nostril...
Four terrorists killed in Bandipore district of Jammu & Kashmir
while attempting to attack a pilgrimage...
-And? -Three.
I have entered the number.
Wait for the password.
I'll get it.
-Come in. -Greetings.
-Come in. -Greetings. -Greetings! -Welcome.
-Greetings. -Greetings.
-Hi, dear. Come. -Hello.
-Hi, dear. Come. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello...
-Did you find parking? -Yes. Please sit.
-Please. -Sit.
You guys are early. People are always late in Mumbai.
We left after the peak hours and the roads were empty today.
We've been to this neighborhood before.
-I see. -I didn't remember earlier.
But when we entered
I remembered that her cousin used to live here.
My cousin's wife's family.
-Sorry. -I see.
-People are decent here. -Absolutely.
You're lucky to find a house in this kind of locality.
He has this one-bedroom flat because he's a bachelor.
The other flats are nice too.
Yes. He comes home just to sleep. Look at the mess here.
He comes home just to sleep. Look at the mess here. I have asked him to hang a painting at least.
I keep busy.
I am happy that he got the house painted.
Guys are always reluctant. They deserve praise if they eat properly.
Will you have tea or cold drinks?
Lemonade?
Ma'am...
-Some tea for us. -Yes.
Has Ajit taken you on a tour of Mumbai yet?
Sudha.
Make six cups of tea
and serve some snacks in the new bowls.
I was posted here.
Where?
Dungarsi Road. He has started with his stories!
We used to live in the same area. Just behind the Opera House.
We moved to Andheri after we got married. But Mumbai has changed a lot.
Everything has. So has Meerut.
It's so green now.
Mr. Manoj, your area is nice too.
It's an old building but there is greenery around.
Like, you have sea views. We have tree views.
It's a good one! You are a "Jokey" man.
The word is "Jovial". They are the same.
My sister-in-law's family speaks highly of you.
Your brother-in-law is married into that family, right? They are the reason we are here.
-Do you come to Mumbai often? -Not really.
Once a year.
But Ajit comes to Meerut on festivals.
-Whenever he gets a break. -Diwali must be spectacular in Meerut!
-Absolutely! We get new outfits made. -I see.
-We hold Lakshmi puja... -We do that too.
And they play cards. It's a cosmopolitan kind of Diwali!
We have a Ram Leela performance there. Ajit had played Ravana once!
Ravana!
-He forgot some lines! -Oh!
He was so nervous.
We will be right back.
Let me show her the house. -My small flat. -Sure.
-My small flat. -Sure. Go ahead.
They talk constantly.
Aparna told me that they have met twice.
Nowadays, things are finalized at coffee shops.
-Marriages, business deals. -Right.
-Marriages, business deals. -Right. Even divorces!
-Why are you talking about divorce? -Why not? It's a fact of life
We will not get divorced.
Oh, come on!
Never!
They are a good match.
Similar lifestyles and values.
The same profession. It's great.
-But mutual understanding is vital. -Correct.
-But mutual understanding is vital. -Correct. -If they want to be together... -That is very important.
-If they want to be together... -That is very important. True.
We saw Aparna for the first time at Mr. Pramod's funeral.
-Were you there? -Yes. He was close to us.
He loved Ajit dearly.
He was a good man. He introduced us to the astrologer. We really believe in him.
You have faith in him. We showed him our horoscopes.
-He told us so many things! -Wow! Here comes the tea! Please come.
Did you add sugar? One more.
-Let him. -He has diabetes.
They are a great match.
Their horoscopes are compatible.
Serve them inside.
She makes very good tea.
It is very nice.
People prefer tea bags these days.
Does she cook?
She does, but not too well.
And do you cook?
-Yes, but not non-veg dishes. -Are you a vegetarian?
Yes, but Ajit is a carnivore.
The guy has a small brain!
I'm good.
Put it there.
Ajit?
-Mom, should we go? -Did you show her the house?
-What do you think? -Are you ready to give up chicken?
Congratulations!
-Congratulations to you too! -Congratulations.
I knew things would work out today, so I got some sweets.
God bless you!
I will talk to my astrologer and call you tomorrow.
-Yes, please. -Definitely.
Ajit!
There is no need!
-We'll meet again. -Sure.
-Congratulations once again. -To you too.
-Keep in touch. -Sure. Call us, sometime. Okay.
Call us, sometime. Okay.
Sudha, Ajit is going to get married!
We will finalize the date soon. Congratulations to you too!
Such a good family. Please take some sweets home.
Only one elevator is working, right? It's a ten-minute wait if we miss it.
I was just about to leave and Ms. Neha gave me some work.
"Dust the painting..." I did that yesterday. She wanted me to do it again!
Am I to blame if someone is renovating their home? "Sweep the balcony, water the plants..." Annoying.
Should I show you something?
Ms. Neha gave it to me.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Pure silk and fully embroidered.
I will fix it or drape a scarf over it.
It will look perfect.
-Absolutely! -Isn't it?
I will wear it on my sister's wedding day.
Wow!
You're not having one?
You seem to have had a good day.
Help!
Why can't you swim?
My dad wasn't a Country Club member.
-How do I look? -Like a mother of two.
Tea!
I'm not that fat.
A woman's heart is lighter?
But it beats faster. There are 11 more differences.
The girls didn't even call me once.
They binge-watching a show?
You are not going to be content...
Talk to me. Do you have a minute?
Sure.
Where are you?
I...
Where are you?
At the beach house.
I'm coming over.
Where are you, Salman? I'm coming.
Now?
We decided that you will come after the housewarming!
Did you send me an email?
What about?
I will email you all the details.
-I will introduce you to Hardik. -Who is he?
My lawyer.
What do I say to him?
-Why are you laughing? -That is the issue.
What I mean is...
you will take care of the girls after I am gone.
What do you mean?
Forget it, Sudhir!
Salman!
You will take care of them after I am gone.
Where are you going? Where are you now?
On my balcony, drinking.
There is no one to give me ice for the whiskey.
Where are the girls?
-Watching a movie with the nanny, I guess. -Did they have dinner?
-Watching a movie with the nanny, I guess. -Did they have dinner? Why don't you ask their mother?
The girls could be starving! Where is the mother? Who is she with?
And why is her location service disabled?
-What are you talking about? -Sudhir...
Sudhir, Reena is bored of me.
-Got it? -Salman...
Listen to yourself!
In 13 years of our marriage, she was happy for only 11 months.
I bet, she will not answer my call.
-Salman, stop the drama. -Sudhir, listen...
Listen...
-Salman. -She will not take the call! I bet.
What if I was in an accident?
You have lost it!
Let the boring husband die!
Are you listening?
Enjoy your beach life.
Find out what's wrong.
Nothing is wrong.
He is pretending.
Don't tell him I asked you to.
What is it, Salman?
-You can call Sudhir up but not me. -He is my buddy. I have every right!
I'm at Geeta's.
Have you gone nuts?
Assume I have.
Tell me this.
Why did Geeta tell me that things are not okay between us
and that you are not at her place?
Why did she say that?
Reena.
He knows.
How?
How?
Geeta told him that I'm not with her.
What else has she told him? How would I know?
We don't send each other messages or emails!
We meet once in a while. -Are we being followed? -We are not.
-Are we being followed? -We are not. Otherwise, he wouldn't have called Geeta.
What did you tell Geeta?
I texted her that I was going on a tour with my HSBC colleague.
I feel guilty.
What have I become?
My children are hungry and my husband is spying on me.
Not Geeta, I'm the bitch.
Tell him you are here.
Tell him you are here to talk to me.
What about?
About your fights. Okay?
About your fights. Okay? End this Geeta chapter now
End this Geeta chapter now or you'll be caught in a lie.
Tell him that you came to me for advice.
You hung up on me?
-At Sudhir's. -What!
-At his beach house. -What!
You're there before the housewarming?
-I needed to talk. -About what?
About us...
Our fights.
Do I go to him and rat on you?
In 12 years of our marriage, I didn't bore you for 10 months.
Do you know why?
In a party.
At the Kishore Thadani one, last week?
Yes.
Reena, Kishore came to our house
Reena, Kishore came to our house and you were seeking sympathy?
What else?
Kishore Thadani of Sunrise Capital!
He will invest 200 crore rupees in my company!
12 years as a banker and you have learned nothing!
Our daughters' education. Dad's 10 crore rupees loan and the debt!
You or I?
It's a 2 crore loan.
You have selfish motives.
Kishore, the beach house and me... We are trophies for you!
I'm coming home.
What if I don't?
What do you mean?
You said I like to collect trophies. What will you do if I stop collecting them?
I will live my life.
What is it about?
Branch Manager, MG Road!
Tell me. What is its worth?
Your life is what I permit it to be. Nothing more.
What kind of life will you have without me?
The girls are hungry. Come home.
That's enough.
Come back.
Reena?
Sudhir,
should we tell Salman?
About what?
Start working again.
Half of your problems will be solved.
What about the remaining half?
Salman told me that I should be happy that he has granted me freedom.
Let's just tell him about it.
What's so complex here?
-It's not? -This is life.
This is an allowance.
You know Salman.
-He talks shit and forgets about it. -I don't.
He will be here soon.
-What? -I told him to come over.
Who did you call?
You should have told me.
How could you do this?
Is this not about me as well?
-Get dressed! -I am dressed!
He wasn't supposed to come here before the housewarming!
Why are you laughing?
Get dressed!
Wear them. Why?
You always wear them at home. -Not here. -I don't want him to notice.
-Not here. -I don't want him to notice.
What has Salman got to do with our relationship?
Stop being childish!
I knew that you had a crush on me in college.
Did you ever talk to me?
If Salman didn't make a scene. at Jamshed's party, would you have dropped me off?
Would you have kissed me
if I wasn't Salman's wife?
Can we meet again if Salman learns about us?
Sudhir,
if he learns the truth...
Our marriage will end.
What about your daughters?
Why do you always involve them?
-Am I not supposed to? -No.
They will be raised as children of divorced parents are.
I'm done, Sudhir.
I cannot take this anymore.
If you want a divorce, what is the point in telling him?
When he sees us together after our divorce...
Us together?
Yes.
Yes.
Forward the email to me.
Alright?
Okay then. Bye.
It's nice.
I repainted the walls. The contractor's dog died. So the work stalled.
It looks empty, doesn't it? Empty is good! We all need space.
-Get me a house like this. -Yours is better, pal!
But I have no voice there.
But I have no voice there. Even this house belonged to a couple.
She looks pretty in your house.
How much did it cost you?
Not much. It belonged to a couple
and I got a good deal out of the property separation.
-What does Kishore Thadani have to say? -He's your friend. You will know better.
-What does Kishore Thadani have to say? -He's your friend. You will know better. He is. Keep at it.
She is up to something.
-You provoke her. -Really?
You just know her version.
-No one hears me out. -Did she?
-No one hears me out. -Did she? No!
She always talks back.
"I gave up my career for you and the kids!
I could have been something!"
She's the Queen of "Could Have Been".
Could've been a CEO, a film star or an Olympian! No matter what...
You must not use the word "Allowance" with her. But why did she lie...
So what? She is Reena!
Don't you get her? She was the most sought after girl in college.
No one had the balls to ask her out.
Except you.
Handling family matters is not my forte.
Talk to her lovingly and take her home.
Didn't you get married as well?
Don't you know?
How could I?
Your mom sent me the invitation card six months after I got married.
Your mom sent me the invitation card six months after I got married. I ate veg Biryani at your wedding.
You went away for a year and then I heard about your divorce.
It has been ten years now! Forget it. You have bigger worries.
Sometimes I feel like...
What did she say?
"She cannot live with me."
Should I divorce her?
Have you lost it?
Listen.
You will never find anyone better.
Everything! She loves your daughters.
-You cannot live without her. -But Kishore Thadani had come home
and she was crying.
When did that happen?
You were right there!
How could she?
Let's watch an action movie tonight. What do you think, Reena?
Sure. Catch a late night show.
It's only a suggestion. You only suggest the things you want to do.
I sat through that boring movie you took me to.
I didn't complain. You had decided not to like it.
Who decided this? A movie should entertain. It should display patriotism or love.
A movie should entertain. It should display patriotism or love.
You like open-ended movies and I, black and white.
I'm tired!
Both of you are.
Eat and go to bed. Am I an idiot?
I drove all the way here.
You're wise and I'm an idiot.
You're wise and I'm an idiot. -Keep saying it. -I will.
Remember that guy -who would say everything three times? -Yes.
-who would say everything three times? -Yes.
He was so strange!
The waiter got three plates of food.
What would he say? Thapar is going to...
-Where is he now? -Dallas.
He sold his startup and is living it up there.
Let's plan a reunion. Start a group. Those were the days! The coffee and the movies!
Those were the days! The coffee and the movies!
This guy introduced me to black coffee.
-I was broke. He took care of me. -Sudhir...
Can Salman and I talk?
-Here or... -Yes.
-Is it comfortable here? -It is.
He is right. Wash your hands. Let's go home.
Heart Matters. Your YouTube channel.
But how...
I always wanted to be an IAS officer.
My father taught in a Government school.
That is where I went to study.
Maybe, that is why my English accent is...
It's not that simple.
I get irritated with you.
How?
I feel stuck.
What does that mean?
Tell me what the problem is.
You need a mother, not a wife.
I can't do it.
Sudhir saw me crying at Jamshed's party
not at Kishore Thadani's.
Sudhir and I
have been together for three years.
Sudhir Batra? Indiabulls?
My father suffered a stroke.
We could not afford the treatment. He passed away.
That is when I decided to be a heart surgeon.
So it all started with a tragedy.
Let me tell you...
Sudhir?
It is a reversible process. Take care of it and you will be fine.
It is a reversible process. Take care of it and you will be fine. We are there to mend its flaws.
But I have been more concerned...
Salman wants to talk.
Thadani texted.
"Hi Salman."
"Take good care of my money."
Yes.
I'm exhausted.
Crash here.
I'll show you the bedroom.
What are the plans for Saturday?
Your call.
Golf?
Let's have lunch with Ranjeet after that.
Is he back? How is he doing?
His profile on Tinder says...
He can't even catch a Frisbee.
-Salman. -Thadani's team is visiting today.
I left my sunglasses inside.
Sudhir.
-Sudhir... -Not now.
We will talk later.
Will I see you again?
He said two things
And he said...
you can't find out
that he knows about us.
-Did you say anything to him? -No.
What did I say at Jamshed's party?
Nothing.
-So you guys were... -He called me two days later.
I didn't take it.
I called him back after a week.
After we fought again?
No.
It was a peaceful day.
Libertina! The fish was outstanding!
Ms. Rekha...
Principal.
How's the library?
I got it cleaned.
-The books? -The fans.
Who reads books these days? The library is always empty.
Come to my office for a cup of tea. I have asked you several times.
I don't drink tea, sir. I have told you this before.
Is that it?
The principal's eyes will pop out one day.
Megha...
Are you having a tough time?
-I can't do it. -I know.
Come. Let me.
Not every person can fire a bullet.
Look at me. I am an acclaimed marksman.
Be ready to fire one.
-Is it too revealing? -I wish it was.
You are too much!
Go! You'll be late!
Good luck, soldier!
-Megha Verma? -Yes?
This is my daughter, Sanditi. Sorry, I'm late for the meeting.
This is my daughter, Sanditi. Sorry, I'm late for the meeting. She never told me.
She is an excellent student! I have no complaints. I have some.
Thank God I checked her phone!
Look what she is up to!
-She's eating ice cream. -I am...
Did you not like the flavor?
This is an all-girls school. How could she do all this here?
She has uploaded it on telegram.
It's Instagram, Mom!
They participate in debates together. That's how they have become friends.
Please, Ms. Rekha!
You will make them forget our culture!
Such a compliment! Hold on!
Can you do something about her uniform? This skirt is too short.
This skirt is too short.
Why not ask them to wear salwar-kameez instead? It will keep their legs covered.
-Sorry for being late, Paras. -No problem!
I was hanging out with my friend.
So... how are you?
Should we make small talk or get to the point?
Some small talk to start with.
Do you need to use a shawl now?
I am feeling cold.
Take it off. You are sweating.
You can keep it on, if you like.
I'm good.
This is our third meeting. And this time, without our families.
So I want to speak openly.
Sure.
I'm a little shy. I have never asked a girl for her number.
-No, I did when I took her sari. -What!
"I spilled my drink on her on the train." So, I kept her sari with me.
"I spilled my drink on her on the train." So, I kept her sari with me. -You took her sari off on the train? -Yes!
No, I mean...
-The next day, I took it to get washed.. -I see.
But the stains were stubborn.
-Can I ask you something? -Of course!
Did you spill the drink intentionally?
Please, Megha.
I studied in an all-boys school. I don't have game.
I have heard that all-boys school students often treat all-girls school students to ice creams.
often treat all-girls school students to ice creams.
You are smart, Megha.
You are trying to distract me but it won't work.
Shall we get to the point?
-No. -Why not?
-No. -Why not? He's a nice boy!
He has a good job! He has good values.
He is respectable and respectful.
He is not fair skinned but you balance that out.
So what is the problem?
I cannot judge guys. What do you mean?
I did not study in a coed school.
No freedom or allowance.
I wasn't brave enough to meet boys from other schools
or hang out with them
or eat ice creams together.
That is why I want you
to get married.
You can have ice cream to your heart's delight.
-Looking for someone? -Friends show up to prank us, I heard.
No one did.
Please come in.
They must have gotten wasted and gone home.
-Come on. -What!
Sit.
If you could be an animal, which one would you be?
What kind of a question is that?
At work we ask silly questions a lot. But, it's fun.
-So tell me. -Animal?
A cat. A cat!
They have nine lives.
Seven with me... and an another two!
Meow!
What about you?
An alligator.
The sleeping devil.
Beware! He can bite!
Do you know anything about alligators?
No. I have watched Nat Geo a lot.
Male alligators blow bubbles in the water.
Really!
Why? To attract the females!
To excite them.
-Do you want some water? -I'm fine!
Okay, I'll have some.
Congratulations.
Are you drying your hair?
Are you drying the clothes?
Are you chopping tomatoes?
No.
Mom is happy as long as the neighbors are.
I will be happy only when I become a grandma of two.
Oh, Mom! You never fail to mention that.
Keep quiet.
Only us women will understand.
-What do you say? -Right.
You guys talk, we are going to go get some air.
Listen to us, Megha.
Look at my other daughter-in-law.
She is so happy.
She had two kids, one after the other.
She spends the whole day looking after them.
She does not need to break a sweat anymore.
-Break a sweat? -Yes.
Listen,
your mother-in-law squawks all day
and the bed squeaks all night.
This will end once you have kids.
When desires are fulfilled, the toil will end.
What if they are not?
Oh, come on!
Tell me something,
does a woman desire anything more than a child?
No.
There you go.
So this is why you are upset. I noticed
what mom said upset you.
Don't worry about her. We will have a kid later.
We must make love now.
Endlessly.
You look so happy after marriage.
You are always excited! Hey!
So are you.
You are happy, too.
Have you ever watched an adult film?
Have you?
Yes. Back in college.
Even last month... Why?
When the guy says...
And the girl says...
They have a good time together.
Together.
Yes!
I have never understood that!
You either talk or have sex!
Do either of the two. Why do it together?
At work, I either check the accounts or type.
I never do both together.
It doesn't make sense.
Look! Birds!
Take these birds for example.
They either lay eggs or fly. Have you seen a flying bird lay eggs?
What's wrong?
Nothing...
Megha, the Principal has called you.
Go.
Tell me what to do.
Look at the books in this school! Why would you issue such a book?
-It was not me... -Hold on.
She did not issue the book.
Who else could it be?
No wonder. She's a divorcee after all.
Let me take a look at it.
What is it about?
-I have not read it, sir. -Lolita!
Read it. It is about an incestual relationship.
So you have read it.
No!
I do not read such filthy stories! She and her father have read it!
Call Ms. Rekha.
Right.
Jaswant! -Ask Ms. Rekha to come here at once. -Sure.
This is a wildlife book!
I have no idea! I will fix it.
Where is Ms. Rekha?
Let me check on her.
It's no big deal!
Why in the library?
I had two fantasies.
Let me tell you.
An airplane toilet
and in a library.
I fulfilled one fantasy today.
Men are selfish.
They cannot make a woman happy.
We have to do it ourselves.
And the principal
took away my happiness and my husband as well. Husband?
Yes. It's always with me.
It does not talk
and satisfies me.
It's the best husband ever!
Anyway, see you later.
What happened?
It's Sunday.
Hello, Grandma.
-Have you seen the TV remote? -No.
Where is it?
Megha!
Megha! Something has happened to Paras.
Sandhya! Get the First Aid kit!
-Hurry up! -Does it hurt?
Paras! -Sit beside me. -Easy, Paras.
Are you all right?
Forget about her! How did this happen?
It was my fault, Mom!
I felt like she needed me.
I took a rickshaw and asked the driver to hurry.
And we collided with a bull.
It's my fault.
The rickshaw toppled, throwing me out.
I lost consciousness for some time.
People seek light in the dark
but all I wanted was you.
Megha.
Megha.
Go get him a glass of water!
Look over here.
There it is!
-Take it easy. -Just blow on it gently!
Why is this not working?
-Listen to me... -Not at all!
Tell me why we should accept her.
We'll tell our relatives that she's epileptic
to save face.
Please let's not speak of divorce.
-I beg you... -There is no need for that.
We do not want a child from her.
Enough, Mom.
This is between us.
It would be if it happened in the bedroom.
But, it didn't, and so, it's a family matter!
I have heard enough!
Don't come home if you can't live without her.
Goodbye.
-Listen to me. -I don't want to.
-Sorry for being late. -It's all right.
I always arrive early.
It was the annual day program at school.
How was it?
Should we get to the point?
Megha.
Let's forget what happened.
We can start again.
I apologize for what my mom did.
But I cannot divorce you.
-It was just a mistake... -Paras!
I didn't make a mistake.
What happened was not wrong.
But it shouldn't have happened there.
Women desire more than just children.
So
what have you decided?
What do you want to do?
I don't know.
This is gonna be my car in the driveway.
And then the Ford Expedition drove past…
[Belinda] And you could just see every seat was filled.
Crystal, Juan, and my son Justin
were getting in the car.
[Justin] Get in the car, she popped the seat forward. I was like,
"Scoot over. We're not hitting no main streets."
"We're going three, four blocks up the road to 7-Eleven. Scoot over, sis." And, uh…
We didn't even make it past the end of the street.
I get right up here.
I look over, and he's standing there, right by the stop sign.
And the white Ford Expedition turns all the way around,
and he comes sliding back in, and he stops right here.
[Belinda] I race this way,
and I stop to see what's going on with the kids.
[Justin] As we came around I look over, there's a guy with a hooded sweater
with a gun, probably a foot and a half away from me.
[Belinda] I see the gun.
And he was moving his mouth, like, trying to work his way up to it.
Bang, bang, bang.
[Belinda] And all the explosions, and the glass, the tires screeching.
[dispatcher] We're getting several calls, more than four shots heard…
[man] The shots were fired, and, uh…
-[dispatcher] They shot at you? -[Belinda] They were shooting at me.
I just ducked down in the seat thinking, "Oh, my God." I don't even know if they hit the car.
I looked over at my sister and she was just, like, motionless.
-[dispatcher] What's the problem? -[woman] The car came just barreling in.
-It's a Honda Accord. And they came up-- -[dispatcher] What color Honda?
[Justin] We made it to right in front of a grocery store,
right in front of the doors.
I got out of the car, and I picked her up, and I'm sitting there holding her.
[woman] Someone's been shot that's on the floor. It seems like she's not responding.
Address is…
And I felt her head, and…
[dispatcher] RP's going to be responding. It looks like we have a victim.
[officer] Patrol, what's your twenty…?
[Justin] God says, "Ask and you shall receive." I did.
So where was he? He also says everything is according to his plan.
What kind of fucked-up plan is that?
Where's the loving God in my life?
[voice breaks] And I don't get it. I just want to know why, you know? Why?
[Jaimie] It was midnight, and my grandma was in the living room crying.
And they said, "Crystal's been shot."
I said, "Crystal's been shot?" They said, "Crystal's been shot in the head."
The first memory of Crystal I have,
she liked to play baby dolls with me, and she would always ask me questions.
"Oh, Jaimie, did Annabelle get her bottle?" She would make, like…
She would make my playtime fun.
And, uh, she really did. She opened my imagination.
[voice breaks] She made sure that I knew that nothing's impossible.
Everything is possible.
[Jaimie] And I went on MySpace.
[Jaimie] Tonight, a horrible tragedy has happened.
I blogged about that. That's how I got my emotions out. I didn't cry at home.
[Jaimie] I just typed.
I just let my fingers go and… type away.
The very last sentence:
"Crystal, please be okay. I love you more than life itself."
She didn't wake up.
[Belinda] I remember her being here and,
just expect her to… walk through the door again.
It's not going to happen.
[Belinda] When we think of our family and the good times, it's like,
there's a line drawn.
Before Crystal and after Crystal.
She… She was just my pride and joy. I wanted a daughter so bad.
Had three sons.
And so the fourth one it was like, "Yay, got my little girl."
She was my sunshine. She was my life. My life. Yeah.
She would do anything.
She loved heights and roller coasters, and she was so lucky at the casino.
She went to a machine and put five dollars in it, and won $38,000.
And started an air-conditioning heating business with her husband.
They just took off with it.
And then her husband fell back to drug use and the violence.
And so Crystal left him and was back with us.
Yeah.
Just so many memories. God, just so many memories.
A lot of good memories too, but that one night, that's all it takes.
[man] Yeah, same tattoo on the neck.
[Rick] We have a picture of a grim reaper that sits on the desk
of the person who's next up. It's like death is always kind of waiting,
and when you're at the top of the list, that's your case.
You have no idea what you're going to catch. And it was my turn.
[Rick] We've got a shooting over on the west end of the city,
so I get dressed, kiss my wife, drive in, and then your brain starts running.
My first murder case was a gang shooting. Those are always extremely difficult.
That one case, unfortunately, remains open right now.
There's still a guy out there that's gotten away with the ultimate crime. I still think about it.
Uh, my second one was the Crystal Theobald case.
I mean, I can't let two go. There's just no way that two are gonna go, but it started off pretty rocky.
They had multiple casings at the scene, right at the intersection of Greenpoint and Geranium.
[Rick] They had what might've been a shoe involved in it, so they identified that for us.
But I get a chance to see where evidence items are, photographs and measuring of evidence, video.
I'm… My brain was flooded, especially being new in the unit.
It's almost like overload.
[cop] Riverside Police Department.
They had witness statements. Gone door-to-door. We do what we call a canvass.
-[cop] You didn't hear any gunshots? -[woman] We were inside tonight.
[cop] You didn't hear anything or see anything? -[man 1] I wasn't here. -[man 2] No, I was asleep.
-[man 1] I wasn't here. -[man 2] No, I was asleep. [cop] You were asleep?
Anyone that might have either ear or eyeshot of the incident.
[cop] You didn't hear any gunshots?
[man 3] No. My wife said she heard, you know, several pops, yeah.
[cop] She didn't see anything?
There were a couple of detectives who were at the hospital. They're trying to talk to the family,
but they're not being cooperative with the detectives.
I didn't like them. I didn't like them. Didn't…
Didn't like them one bit and… you know, so…
She wasn't exactly trusting of me. She didn't know who I was, and--
I didn't call the police to help me if I had an issue.
I didn't. It wasn't the police I called.
They were coming at my family like we were the ones that did it.
Threatening and telling my boys, "I'll lock you up."
"You know, if we catch wind of…" You know,  that made me upset.
They put me in handcuffs and throw me in the back of a cop car and interrogate me for hours.
And I didn't get it, didn't understand.
[Ben] Took the detectives and I told them, I said,
"My family had nothing to do with this."
You want them to know I'm doing everything I can to help. That's all I'm here for.
Whatever you got going on, unless it's pertinent to my case, I don't care.
I'm here to try and solve this homicide for you and your family,
and to put somebody who killed Crystal away.
So then, you know, we opened up a little more, but…
[Rick] There's a lot of rumors running around as to what might've happened.
What are you thinking is…?
[Belinda] I'm thinking there's been a lot of gang problems with that, uh, 5150.
[Rick] This is what we call the West End.
This kind of loop is where the actual shooting took place,
but even more so where 5150 claim territory.
[Rick] But there were also multiple other gangs, Black, Hispanic, who laid claim to the same area.
So there's turf wars, and guys that see each other. There'll be conflict.
[reporter] Rival Latino and Black gangs involved in drug trafficking…
[Rick] 5150 kind of came into existence for us in Riverside around 2003, give or take.
They tried to establish themselves and made some inroads
into being a particularly violent and confrontational gang,
graduating to assaults, to shootings, to then, uh, murdering three people
within the city in the course of two and a half to three years.
It was a very quick evolution.
[Mario] We're in Riverside now.
All kinds of shootings, and every night people will get stabbed, robbed.
As soon as people heard 5150, like, they got scared.
You know, they said we were murderers. We're killers.
Never once did I ever think that society would look at us like that.
Originally Riverside was, uh… It was kind of like an outcast from L.A.
All the people that couldn't afford to live in L.A. or in Orange County,
they came out to Riverside. So a lot of, I would say poor people.
I don't think we ever even went to, like, the beach or Disneyland.
Nothing like that ever.
We never experienced anything outside of, like, that area.
So we thought that that was life.
Fifty-one, fifty, it was like me and my cousins or family members backing each other up. That was the whole motive.
backing each other up. That was the whole motive. Like, we're family. That was it.
We would all be out here. Nothing really happening.
We were all under 18 years old, you know.
When we were kids, uh, you know, everybody targeted us.
[Rick] Give me a full description of this--
[Belinda] He was young. He was young. He was a kid.
-But if I see him, I will know him. -[Rick] Okay.
[Belinda] Then there was more interviews and looking at pictures.
[Rick] This particular binder has got all the different gang members.
And it kind of helps me to keep track of who's who in the zoo.
I do remember Belinda telling me the shooter had been a really young, almost white-looking Hispanic guy, like a real baby face.
almost white-looking Hispanic guy, like a real baby face.
She saw his face, and she'd absolutely be able to identify him. Wouldn't be a problem.
This is the sketch that was drawn based off the information provided by Belinda.
I looked through annuals, yearbooks,
looking for people who are gang members and have a current picture I can look at.
I'm talking with Belinda, I say, "I got pictures I want you to look at."
She starts going through the pictures. And she gets to a young kid.
And she stops
and says, "That's him."
One day Detective Wheeler called and said that, uh,
they have somebody they think might be involved in it,
and if they could drive me down there to get a look at him.
And she IDs him. "That's him. That's the guy."
[Rick] You doing okay, dude?
We start pressing him on this case and ask him where he was,
and he's given us a particular alibi as to where he was, who he was with.
[suspect] I wasn't there.
[Rick] I know that you were, though. I got somebody who identified you.
I'm telling him, "We're gonna check this out." "Don't lie. I'll find out if you're lying to me."
We were at my house, and then we went to his brother's girlfriend's house.
[Ricky] He's saying, "I wasn't there."
"I was over at a friend's house. I was with a friend. You can call them."
"You can check with them." I get a couple of my partners
"You can check with them." I get a couple of my partners to go over and verify his alibi.
And it's solid.
[suspect crying] Please!
Let me go home! [crying] Let me go gome.
[Rick] So now I'm starting to think, "Uh-oh, I got a bad ID here?"
"That's not a good start." And we ended up sending him home.
They really didn't explain things to me well enough,
like you make one mistake and identify somebody that's not involved,
they can no longer use what you have to say when it comes to court.
So that complicated the case for the detective.
You start off with a case very optimistic. We'll handle this. This is gonna get done.
Then you reach a point to where there aren't any more leads,
and… and now it's almost a war of attrition.
[Belinda] And I promised her.
It was the last thing I got to say to her, besides "I love you."
I promised her that I was gonna get him if it's the last thing I do. I'm gonna get him. They're gonna pay.
if it's the last thing I do. I'm gonna get him. They're gonna pay.
[Jaimie] I guess I was, uh, talking to Nick on MySpace,
and he had told me how the guys,
the people involved, had MySpace.
He said, "They all have profiles."
[Nick] I pretty much, like, knew it was 5150 already.
You know the streets talk, like, you just hear stuff. I mean, little by little you find out.
I was young. I was just a kid when she passed away.
I was maybe 13 years old, so at that time when that happened, I didn't really know about gangs.
[Jaimie] I talked to Aunt Belinda. I said,
"MySpace. I can go on there. I can search for you."
"Get information for you."
[Belinda] I knew nothing about the social media. I wasn't on the MySpace.
She said, "How do you do it?" I said, "I can do it all. Don't worry."
I was 14.
About to turn 15.
[Lauer] If you've got a teenager at home, chances are that he or she spends a lot of time
on the social networking website called MySpace.com.
I knew everything about it. The ins and outs.
How to make it look like this, how to make this pop up in your text,
how to make colored text, everything.
[reporter] With 66 million users nationwide,
MySpace is one of the most popular networking sites used by kids.
Most of the kids at my school use MySpace. You put pictures up. Meet girls, guys.
It was brand-new, popular. Everyone wanted to be on it. I was obsessed with it.
I was excited. You want to give me this chance? You want to give me responsibility?
I thought to myself, "How can I snoop better?"
[Belinda] So Jaimie Googled a picture and found a pretty girl.
[Jaimie] She had a Supergirl shirt on. I was like, "You're gonna be my Supergirl."
I  just wanted a pretty face, a pretty body,
and it was gonna be my brain behind it.
[Belinda] And we named her Rebecca, and we posted that up.
[Jaimie] I made her in the eyes of what I thought the gang members would like.
Added in, "Smoke weed, and I like to drink beer."
But I said cerveza because I thought it was more clever.
I wanted them to 100% think, "This girl on this MySpace is real."
I had the top eight. I befriended all of them. Clicked on that person's profile,
I befriended all of them. Clicked on that person's profile, went to their top eight,
added all of their top eight.
You got clicked, and everyone got clicked, and everyone got added,
and I just kept adding and adding until I had a MySpace full of guys
that were 5150, and it looked like I belonged.
I said, "Aunt Belinda, I got it set up. What do you want me to do?"
"Get as much information as you can."
[Jaimie] I was making them like me. Just making them trust me.
[Belinda] They don't even spell a word out. I had to ask, I go, "What does LOL mean?"
My typing was acting. That's what my acting was.
[Belinda] Just trying to find out where they were from, what they were doing.
Of course, I knew that they were driving a white Ford Expedition that night.
She wanted me to start prying for information real quick.
And I was like, "No, no, no, I gotta play it out." "Let me do this in, like, a week."
Give me three days at least before I start being like, "Hey, what car do you drive?"
Okay. He had the white Ford Expedition.
Yeah, two of them.
That even made it even more confusing too.
With the witnesses and everybody, because the two vehicles the same color.
I… I remember at some point early on, we talked about the vehicles in the area.
Okay, this one's Robbie.
[Rick] Neighbors had seen a couple of vehicles. Some described them as SUVs,
like Expeditions or something of that nature.
They were parked right here.
[Rick] Doing laps in the area almost as if they were chasing each other.
I remember asking them about that. "You saw it? Know what happened?"
"You were getting in your cars to go somewhere else
about the time that these vehicles were speeding through the area."
And I can remember them playing kind of dumb about it.
Yeah, there… there was a little bit. Um…
I didn't come forth with everything that I knew right away.
[Rick] Where was Robert when this happened?
[Belinda] Robert? I don't know. Robert had nothing to do with this.
[Rick] Sure. Sure.
[interviewer] So you tell the story of that night, you don't mention Robbie.
[Belinda] Oh, yeah, because that had happened before,
but then that just kind of went out the door.
I mean, I wasn't even thinking about where Robbie went.
I went to go find Robbie. And we were getting ready to go to the store, and--
It turned out later on that the older brother, Robert, was actually one of the vehicles being chased,
and they didn't offer that up for quite a while.
[Rick] So this whole thing starts with Robbie
parked almost directly across from his parents' house, talking to a friend.
I pulled up to his house, and, um, my buddy came out.
He's just in the passenger window talking to me.
And, uh, my girlfriend, she kind of got, like, she had a look on her face.
And, uh, there was an Expedition behind us.
And I looked at my buddy, and he was kind of getting spooked,
and kind of backpedaling back up to the house.
I did have an eerie feeling like I don't know these people. I don't…
I don't have these problems in life, man, you know? Um…
I turned on my brights, and, uh, I just gunned it.
[Robbie] I thought I'd hit them or the curb, like something was bound to go wrong. And I slid around the corner.
And immediately they started chasing me.
[Rick] You were not in an SUV that night?
-[Robbie] No. -[Rick] Absolutely not?
I can't tell you how many people saw two SUVs that night.
Realize, Robert, that I am here to help your family. That's all our jobs.
[Robbie] I'm gone. I don't think it's an issue. Whatever it was, it's gone.
I head over towards my daughter's mom's house.
And, uh, I get there, and I pull up, and she's all hysterical.
[sighs] I think we started doing some follow-up on… the family.
I learned that the Lane-Theobald family had some issues back in the day.
People had been arrested, in prison.
My boys, you know, they're boys, and they're going to have their problems,
and they like to fight, and whatever they do.
Even with Belinda, uh, there were drug issues in the past.
[Christy] We've been in the drug world together.
Using. But I don't want to say all that. Do you want me to say all that?
Well, you know, it started out a little weekend fun,
but then became mama's little helper.
It was like that's how you go to work and work two jobs,
and take care of five kids, and the house.
It was meth. Meth, the devil dope.
Go to work, take your line, you know? Come home from work. [scoffs]
I mean, kids were always around, but not seeing.
They weren't seeing that. We weren't doing drugs in front of the kids.
Uh…
They tried to hide it as much as they could, but it was super obvious.
Yeah, then, the bigger issue was when I was selling drugs and went to prison.
[Rick] She's had dealings with the police in the past for her own issues,
for her son's issues.
Yeah. Yeah. I… I sold a lot. I did a lot of damage out there.
All of Riverside, I… I did.
I've put a lot of drugs on the streets. A lot.
And all Crystal ever asked her, all the time when she was younger,
was, "Mom, please, quit using. Please, please, please."
So now the idea of who might be responsible for this
opens up a little bit more.
That, is it something from somebody's past issues in prison?
Is it somebody's past issues with gangs?
Is it somebody owed somebody money, or drugs, or, you know,
all of a sudden now the world of possibility opens up even further,
because there's this compromising situation with the victim family.
[Jaimie] Every day. Get out of school, walk straight home.
Hours upon hours.
From three o'clock in the afternoon till one o'clock in the morning,
I'd be on there.
I think it got harder for me when my Aunt Belinda came up with the idea of making Crystal a MySpace.
when my Aunt Belinda came up with the idea of making Crystal a MySpace.
[Belinda] Rebecca just wasn't getting us enough hits
from the ones that we were interested in.
And so I asked her, "Can you put Crystal's picture up there?"
[Jaimie] I said, "Crystal. Why do you want to make Crystal a MySpace?"
Make them fall in love with her.
[Belinda] We decided to name her Angel. And I wrote on her profile
that I was going to be their biggest life mistake
and their deepest, darkest, best-kept secret.
And, boy, they just started responding.
It's like, boy, just left then right, ping, ping, ping.
I'd be on there switching back and forth. I'd have two pages open.
I would just minimize one, go to Angel, minimize the other, go to Rebecca.
My Supergirl. She wasn't making them fall in love.
She was more or less a booty call, you know? Crystal was the love.
Rebecca pried a lot, was nosy.
Like, "Oh, tell me this, tell me that." It was very, very flirty.
And, like, teenager-y.
Like, "Oh, today was a shitty day." Like, "Uh, school sucks."
Like, a little sad face and stuff.
Angel's was always upbeat and sweet. She had good fonts. She had big fonts.
Little fonts, pink fonts, blue fonts, sparkly fonts. [chuckling]
[Belinda] It wasn't long.
The profile had just barely been up when William Sotelo responded.
He doesn't watch movies. He watches porn. He doesn't read books. It was, "eff books."
And he's standing in his profile. "I'm from 5150, and I'm down to kill."
So I just got tunnel vision on Sotelo.
I mainly talked to him.
He was very adamant about 5150 on MySpace.
[Belinda] Jaimie's putting in messages. He's sending messages back.
"Well, what do you do besides party and drink?"
I'm not really the party girl, once in a while.
"No, no, no, that's not my thing. I have goals."
"I'll show you. I'm gonna be somebody."
When you want someone to want you, you play with them.
And I did what Crystal taught me to do, um, make the boy come to you.
[Belinda] We told him, uh, Angel's mom's in prison for cooking meth.
And I thought maybe that'd get them to open up a bit about drugs or prison.
[Belinda] He came back opposite of what I would've thought.
[Belinda] It got deep. It was like, "Wow."
His messages, he was getting more sweet.
[Jaimie] How he wanted to give me the world and make sure nothing else got in the way of it.
[Jaimie] I have this picture of Crystal in my head. [sniffs] I really had to portray that.
[voice breaks] I had to show him she was a beautiful person.
She was hard not to fall in love with.
You'd meet her, you'd fall in love with her.
[sniffles] Her personality, her smile.
It was hard not for that guy to fall in love with her.
[Jaimie] He said, "Hey, girl, I'm having a party tonight. You want to come?"
[Belinda] "What's up? I'm ready tonight. You don't have a car, I'll come get you."
We're like, no, no, no.
They wanna meet me. "What do I do?" And she goes, "Well, well, tell him yes."
"And then send him a message, like, at the very last minute."
"And say you can't make it."
And then, like, an hour later, I was like, "Damn, I cannot find a ride."
He was so adamant about trying to get me to come out that night.
It was more than he had ever tried before.
"Oh, girl. I'll come pick you up then."
So I was like, "Oh, so if you were to come pick me up, what car am I supposed to look for?"
[Rick] That white truck, was there anything that stood out about it?
Like, was it lowered, or have some kind of special rims on it, anything at all?
[Belinda] It was an Expedition. I don't know what make that is.
-[Rick] Okay. -[Belinda] If that's a Ford or what.
Belinda knew enough that I was looking for a particular kind of vehicle.
An Expedition. It was a white color, but it also had some gold accent here and there.
And I was looking for the 5150 gang member who had that car.
I went ahead and called Detective Wheeler and told him,
"Look, this is what I found out, and I think we found him." "This is who they are."
[Rick] I remember her calling me saying, "Jokes. It was his car." "Jokes drove that car. It was him."
That's also where the MySpace account started to come into play. Um…
At the beginning, I told her, "I wish you would've told me you were starting this."
"I wish you would've told me you were starting this." "So I would've known ahead of time."
But, uh, rolling through the comments from these various guys
that were just head over heels for this girl.
I mean, they… A pretty lady, a pretty girl,
and her talking to them the way that, that she was.
It was no wonder they got lured in. It's a great way to set it up.
So my next thought is, I got to get a hold of William Sotelo, Jokes.
If he in fact is the driver, he should be able to tell me who else was in the car.
If he in fact is the driver, he should be able to tell me who else was in the car. He should be able to tell me who the shooter is.
[Rick] Okay. All right, Will.
We'll get you right back here once we're all finished up.
He was in the Job Corps.
You're doing your GED. I know what that means.
-What are you doing as far as the cooking? -[Will] Pantry cook.
[Rick] He was supposedly studying to be a chef.
That's cool, man. That's better than what you were doing.
-[Will] Yeah. -[Rick] Big time.
We talked all the way back from San Bernardino to Riverside.
All right. You wanted a water? See if you can get one for him?
-Sorry about that. -[Will] No problem.
Your name has popped up in a case that I'm working. Okay?
-Case? -[Rick] Yeah. In an investigation that I'm doing.
What is it? Gang members, or…?
[Rick] Well, it's got to do with 5150. There's a girl that got shot.
-Girl? -[Rick] Mm-hm.
The thing that I need to ask you about,  though, is your… your car.
Your Ford Expedition was identified as being there.
[Will] Was it mine? With the license plates? I don't know.
[Rick] Yeah, your car was there. -Uh-huh. -[Rick] And… -When was this? -[Rick] Back in February.
-When was this? -[Rick] Back in February.
-Back in February? -[Rick] Mm-hm.
I don't know.
[Rick] Yeah, you do, man.
When he would give me things that were denials
or, um, he'd refute evidence I had, I would just keep pushing him back into,
"It's not a question of whether you were there. I know you were there." "I want to know why."
Nobody else in 5150 or anyone else in that area drives that car but you.
Every time I talk about Jokes, it's always that car.
-Jokes? Uh-huh. -[Rick] Uh-huh. That's you.
Now is the time that you really need to be straight up with me
because I am your only ally right now.
I think after a while that wore him down.
The problem is if you sit and tell me, "I wasn't there…"
All right, like, I'll say the truth, but-- [Rick] That's what I want you to tell me. The truth.
I wasn't involved in it. It just happened. [Rick] Tell me. Tell me what happened.
[Will] I don't know. We were just cruising. Like, driving around by Rutland.
[Rick] Rutland Park? Is that 5150 territory,
or isn't that close to MD territory?
[Will] Yes, that's MD's territory. [Rick] And everybody's piled into your Expedition?
[Will] It was full, probably like seven people in the car.
This white Expedition passed quick, almost hit my truck.
He cuts us off, like, whoosh. Almost, like, this close to hitting the truck.
"This is where we were when we saw the SUV Robert was driving."
"This is where we stopped when the cars drove up on us."
And then they started…
The… The white Expedition started shooting at the car, at my truck.
-[Rick] They shot at your truck? -[Will] Yeah.
I was gonna take off, and Lil Huero's like, "Just stop."
-He got out. -[Rick] Okay.
So Little Huero gets out, right?
Where did he walk to? Did he walk to--?
I don't know. I started ducking. There was bullets everywhere.
[Rick] That's pretty ballsy to get out if somebody is shooting at you. Pretty ballsy to get out of the car.
He's crazy. He's psycho. It's weird.
[Rick] What did you see in the car with the girl inside when it went by?
-I don't know. -Did it look like it got hit?
-It did. -[Rick] It have bullet holes in it?
No, like the window was shattered. [Rick] Which window?
The front… The front, like, um, passenger side.
[Rick] Okay. And you said you were getting shot at? Did your car get hit?
No. Um, I don't think it got hit. [Rick] That's close for them not to hit you.
-I'd have thought you've been hit. -I don't know.
[Rick] And we had no bullet strikes in William's SUV, no shell casings,
no weapons that were found within the Theobald household.
And lacking that evidence, I don't have anything to substantiate
that they were fired at by the Theobald family.
Okay, when did you see Little Huero again?
I never saw him. I never heard from him or saw him ever again.
-[Rick] No? -Mm-mm.
[Rick] They had not had contact with him, Julio Heredia.
They hadn't seen him. He wasn't out doing the crimes that he'd been doing.
He was kind of a ghost.
So, Little Huero, Julio Heredia, he's definitely looking like a prime suspect.
I need to find him. I need to get ahold of him.
Why don't we take a break? Mind hanging out for a few minutes?
-Okay. -[Rick] Okay, be right back.
-Is this, like, all gonna stay here? -[Rick] What's that?
Is anybody else going to find out about this?
-[Rick] Am I gonna go run and tell? -I don't wanna get killed.
[Rick] I ain't gonna tell Little Huero about it.
[Rick] I didn't have enough for an arrest for William at that point.
And since everything was on his willingness to help me out, legally,
I was going to have to let him go at the end of it. Um…
because I promised him I would.
-San Bernadino or--? -Could you drop me off at Parkview?
[Rick] Parkview? I can do that.
But he was huge. Very big piece.
This is the matrix covering the different people also at the homicide,
at the scene when it happened.
Um, this is William Lemus Junior, and his nickname was Little Rascal.
And his brother Manuel.
Manuel's nickname was Tripper.
[Manuel] I felt like it was just bullshit.
At school, gangs were aiming for little kids, to take them in when they were little.
I wasn't with it. I told them, "They're too young."
And they looked at me and said, "How do you think we got you in?"
[Manuel] I went to their house party, and I liked everything that they did.
And that house was full of people.
Loud music playing.
But at that moment, I felt like this is where I wanted to be.
Next thing you know, I got a guy in a bike coming up to me.
I remember beginning of school year,
somebody said that the guy on the bike is the one that shoots you.
Julio.
He's like, "Right on. Give him a beer." I don't drink.
"Do you want to be in, or no?"
"Yeah."
"Get him some weed." "I don't smoke."
"You want to be in? Do this. You want to be in? Do that."
Puts up his hand and said, "Get him."
[Manuel] One of the kids grabbed me, tackled me to the floor, speared me to the floor down.
And then, like, you're in.
And they just started hugging me, holding me.
"We'll get your back  whenever anything happens."
Next thing in school, they want me to hang out with them. They want me to be around their table.
And then I was like, "Hey, I'm making it in now."
The way I felt was,
"Why should I be scared?" "Shouldn't I feel safe?"
Have that feeling that no one will come after me.
I'm with the ones that come after people.
We lived very peacefully there. Very peacefully.
There were never any problems, nothing, nothing.
All those guys were his friends because they were all from the same neighborhood.
They were his friends.
They seemed so innocent.
They showed me respect. They didn't use bad language.
And I had no idea what a big problem that was.
It wasn't done yet. That's why I stayed on for so long.
That's why I never got off because I still had a lot more to do.
[Jaimie] I really tried to be Crystal.
Making someone fall in love with someone who's dead is not a good feeling inside.
When I was messaging as Angel…
pretending to be her,
I was really, really keeping her alive in my heart.
I was with her again all night long.
Staying up late.
I think that's what made it difficult at the end.
It just… It felt like I was…
stuck pretending to be her.
She wasn't here anymore. It was hard to look at her face every day.
[Jaimie] That's when the MySpace got hard for me.
I said I was done.
I couldn't do it anymore.
Oh, yeah, I was so… I was very depressed, very depressed. Uh…
I said, "Why isn't William Sotelo in custody?"
After they find out everything, and he admits to it.
[Justin] Everything has a breaking point, sooner or later.
Like a jar, all this stuff going in.
There's no release valve. It just keeps going in, and the jar is starting to crack.
And stuff's starting to come out with nowhere to go.
[Rick] I understand how the streets work. You want to handle this. Your brothers want to handle this shit.
-Enough harm's been done. -[Justin] Right.
[Rick] You don't need to go back to jail. Your brothers don't need to.
Your mom doesn't need this kind of anguish, so…
I know her boys weren't exactly interested in us
bringing the resolution about.
They were used to handling things their way. And that wasn't going to be good for anybody.
Are your sons, uh, wanting to take care of this themselves?
-[Belinda] No. -[Rick] No? Okay. Good.
Yeah, we don't… We don't need that.
Only because of a promise to my mother
did we not pursue what we felt we wanted to.
Okay, everybody, no violence. Not in my daughter's name.
But in the back of my own mind, I still knew I was going to kill him.
And so I took over the site then because after so many months,
you begin to wonder, "My God, are they ever going to get him?"
And I just go into the zone with this anger.
Everything I could learn about their family. Everything I could learn about them.
Riverside High School.
I started getting a little braver.
And I'd drive past their houses and go take pictures of the vehicles,
the license plate numbers.
I called the FBI and ICE.
I was trying to get them all deported.
If there was a problem I could bring to one of them, I would.
Looked at some of their religious effects.
Santería. Dropped a couple things off in their yard.
Black candles, and that little voodoo doll that came from Spencer's
with a million pins in it.
Belinda was just kind of, uh, psycho, you know?
In her own little world. And, uh…
loved her to death because she's… You know, but she can be crazy.
[Belinda] I befriended some Casa Blanca gang members.
I went on there and told them,
"William Sotelo is talking a gang a shit about you.
He says you motherfuckers are pussies."
And pissing them off. They're like, "Oh, you wanna bang on the MySpace?"
Bangin' on the mic and shit, MySpace…
[Belinda] I'm like, "Bitch, you want to come see me?" "Take the 91 Freeway."
"Exit at La Sierra. Turn right." "And I drive the white Ford Expedition, bitch."
[Rick] She went on a bit of a tirade with that MySpace account.
What we did was great, but this is gonna screw stuff up
if now, you start threatening them, start doing things
that will draw any kind of sympathy on their part.
Detective Wheeler came and said,
"There's been an exceptionally large number of white Ford Expeditions
that are being shot up and burned up and vandalized."
I just don't want there to be any loose cannons out there
that can throw a wrench in everything.
He goes, "I think you need to knock off all your bullshit."
"And stay off the Internet, and let us do our job."
And I'm like, "Okay. Yeah, right. Sounds good."
Sounds like I'm getting somewhere with something, Last thing I was going to do is back off.
[Belinda] Then it was around April 20th, four, 20, the penal code for marijuana.
And they were all up there. "Happy 4/20."
"Smoking a big one," and, "We're all partying." You know?
And then I got to thinking, party.
I started sending bulletins out
saying Angel's having an End of the World party on 6/6/06,
and I'm not gonna tell you where the party's gonna be till six o'clock that night.
[Christy] I remember her telling me about the 5150 gang,
and that she was portraying somebody else to lure one of the guys.
She was having this party. Something about some party.
[Belinda] Out there through Perris, there's a road called Ryder Road.
Here's where the story gets even trippier.
[Belinda] Someplace where I can see them coming in, but they not see me.
And I just… Yeah.
[Christy] She says, "You won't believe what I'm doing." And I said what I was scared more of.
I go, "I know this is what you want to do, but I thought it was insane."
[interviewer] Who was gonna do the shooting?
Oh, I was gonna shoot them. I was gonna… That was mine.
They were mine. I was gonna shoot them myself.
Yeah, I had a plan, and I had a gun.
-[interviewer] Are you a good shot? -I wasn't gonna be that far.
Just have him pull in and just up on the top,
and figure we'd get the drop on them.
You know?
And it was gonna be the end of their world.
[Robbie] I remember coming home, and, uh…
yeah, she was headed out. She was determined.
Regardless what it was, it was gonna make her feel better.
And that's what she wanted, you know? Um…
[Belinda] My husband, my boys are like, "Mom, you need to back off."
"You need to stop."
[Robbie] We weren't gonna let her act on it. It was like we were gonna lose our mom, you know?
I made a plan to go murder people. I made a plan to go murder people. Let that sink in a minute.
You're suicidal, or you're homicidal, you're just…
You don't care, but you care too much.
[Belinda] It was just, uh, the day before.
I'm not gonna hurt him. I'm not gonna kill him.
But I was just at the computer,
and I was crying, crying, crying.
[Belinda] I wanted him to hurt like we were hurting.
[Belinda] You're not talking to Angel. This is the little girl you killed.
Apparently, you didn't even know who you had killed
because none of you recognized her picture.
Why'd you kill me?
I had dreams. I had hopes.
Why did… Why?
He didn't respond to that, no.
That's when I gave, uh, the detective, uh, the MySpace.
I handed over the passwords and MySpace
to keep myself in check.
[Rick] So Jokes, uh, he just dropped off the face of the earth.
Nobody saw him anymore. Nobody had any more contact with him.
Because we didn't have William in custody at the time,
I needed somebody else to tell me what took place in that car.
All right, so this is Wyburn, epicenter for 5150 back in the day.
There was a street where there were also two other gang members
that had been inside the car, the Lemus brothers.
This house over here on my left, that was the Lemus brothers' house.
So knowing that Jokes had named them as being people in the car,
they were my next step, since I couldn't find Julio.
There was a shooting.
I don't know if people were shooting at you. I don't know if you were shooting somebody.
If I was involved in a shooting…
-I think they shot at us. -[Rick] …I would remember.
[Manuel] And he asked me again. "We know everything."
"You're the only one that's not talking."
[Rick] You told me you didn't know and you weren't in the car. Now I know that's all lies.
'Cause you're telling me that my brother's over here, then you let us talk a bit.
Then he's coming telling me, "You gotta tell them this and this." -"'Cause then he's gonna lock you up." -[Rick] He was being honest about it.
-"'Cause then he's gonna lock you up." -[Rick] He was being honest about it.
He didn't hide anything. He said, "I was there."
[Manuel] He goes, "Your brother is in the other room." "And he told us everything."
-[Rick] Is this the front of the car? -Yeah. The front of the car.
[Rick] Okay.
This is me. This is my brother. We're the only ones in the back.
-[Rick] You're in the very back? -Yeah.
[Rick] This is William Lemus, his drawing. So you can see he's talking about Jokes and Huero.
Jokes said, "These people were in the car," William Lemus confirmed the same thing. Stories were starting to look the same.
William Lemus confirmed the same thing. Stories were starting to look the same. Vehicles were the same. Shooter was the same.
He fired one kind of high, and then he pointed at the car.
-Yeah. -Bam, bam, bam, bam.
-And those hit the car. -Those hit the car. Okay.
That's him. It's not me.
"We're going to bring him in here." Okay.
[Rick] Let's see if we can talk with him.
[Manuel] They brought him in. And right there, in that instant,
I wanted to lunge at him…
and just attack my brother.
The rules say, "You don't say anything."
-[Rick] You're telling me the truth? -[Manuel] They will kill him.
[Rick] The other way, you're lying.
So you want to lie to me in the middle of a murder investigation? Roll the dice.
Or tell the truth, and tell me what actually happened.
It doesn't get any more black and white.
I know I didn't kill anybody. [Rick] So, fine. Tell me what happened.
[Manuel] I was like, "It's okay. You're not gonna get one word from me."
[inhales deeply] And they released us.
When they released us…
I looked at my brother, and I told him, "I don't know what you just did."
I already knew the gang wants to kill me and my brother.
Well, one day, or should I say one night…
5150 did a meeting.
They were talking and telling us, "Hey, it was your brother, wasn't it?"
"I don't know. He wasn't in the same room. He was in a different room."
"Why was he in a different room? Why was he longer?
Why did you get out, and then he got out right when you got out?"
"I don't know."
"What would you do if I killed your brother?"
"Would you be okay with it?"
I looked at him and I was like…
"I would do exactly the same thing you'd do if someone killed your brother."
So I made my choice right there and then.
I'm out.
And I just walked away.
I wanted my brother to be okay.
I went with my brother, and we left to L.A.
Well, if they couldn't get us, I knew they were gonna try to get my mom and dad.
I told my mom and dad to get out of there.
Mom and Dad didn't listen.
[operator] Sir, what is your address, please?
[Will] 3445 Glasgow.
[Betty] A bunch of kids all dressed in black.
Maybe they weren't kids. I couldn't tell, they were so far away.
[operator] Okay, and how many kids are you talking about?
[Will] About ten, 12.
My husband called the police, and they asked, "Are you going to stay there?"
"No, how can I stay here?" he said. "We're leaving, send someone to check."
-[operator] What is your name? -[Will] My name is William Lemus,
-[operator] What is your name? -[Will] My name is William Lemus, but I do not want to get involved in this.
[operator] You don't want the officer to knock? [Will] Of course not.
[Betty] We were able to leave, we left. But we did not know what they were going to do.
[Manuel] I have a feeling that if my mom would have not left, they probably would've burned them alive.
[Betty] All the sentimental things.
But since I am Christian, the Bible says,
"The thoughts of man are not the same as those of God."
[Manuel] Is there such thing as loyalty in this world? It means nothing, actually.
[Rick] All right, Manuel, your dad said you wanna talk more?
-Yeah. -[Rick] Okay. To remind you…
[Manuel] When they tried to do something to my mom and dad, I said,
"Okay, fine. Give me the detective. I'll tell him anything he wants to hear."
Do you remember more of what happened that night?
I can tell you the whole story now. [Rick] Okay.
The beginning was that, my friends,
I don't know about what time, late at night,
they came knocking at our house.
So it's nighttime.
I'm in an SUV.
A car pulls up.
One of the guys gets out of the car like, "Hey."
"They tried to kill me." "And tried to shoot me with my daughter in the car."
It's a big SUV, big truck or something.
It was MD.
Another gang.
Julio, he was determined to do something.
Fuck them. We're taking them out right now.
[Rick] They had shown up in the area of Greenpoint and Geranium
looking to retaliate against a rival gang that they thought
looking to retaliate against a rival gang that they thought had shot at one of their gang members earlier in the day.
They didn't know who the Theobalds were. They didn't have any connection with them.
But they run into Robert's SUV. They see him.
I don't know what happened. I was in the SUV sitting there.
We're parked right here, and he's facing us right here.
[Rick] And when Robert takes off, they chase him. And it's at that point that they lose him
and stop at the intersection of Greenpoint and Geranium.
Two vehicles drive up to their car that has stopped almost in the middle of the intersection.
And they thought that this was rival gang members coming to attack them.
[Manuel] Julio gets out of the SUV, and walks in the middle of the road.
By that moment, he's pulling out his piece and just fired away.
The one round that struck Crystal caught her in the back of the head,
kind of just around the neckline.
And, um, that would've been one of the final rounds that was fired
as the vehicle's leaving the area.
And then four blocks ahead, we see it pull over. We already knew someone got hit.
-[Rick] Out, like outside? -[Manuel] Yeah.
-Lil Huero. -[Rick] Just Lil Huero?
-Just him. -[Rick] Okay.
[Rick] I developed a rapport with William Lemus and Manuel,
to where I feel like they trusted that I had their best interests at heart.
to where I feel like they trusted that I had their best interests at heart. I stood up, and I turned around so he could see from behind.
I wasn't wearing a wire.
And they could be my very key witnesses in this case.
He'd be on the passenger side, but in the seat behind.
[Rick] That pushed everything into the area
that this will end up in a courtroom. Somebody's gonna be held responsible.
[officer] Police Department! Search warrant!
[Rick] We ended up doing a large gang sweep with a whole bunch of agencies.
[reporter] Police carried out gang association search warrants.
Somewhere in the neighborhood of 25 to 30 houses were hit all at the same time
on a particular morning.
[reporter] "This was a reign of terror," said the D.A.
"I think we took the gang apart on Wednesday."
[Rick] The guys that were working the intel for Julio Heredia
called and said, "We've got a line on where he's at."
Julio woke up one day surrounded with cops.
And they were Mexican cops.
I'm wanting to say it was within a day. I think we got him up here.
Today we take back our park, our streets, our neighborhood,
Today we take back our park, our streets, our neighborhood, and a part of our community and return it to the rightful owners.
[Belinda] There's no justice. Justice would be  if they could find a way to bring Crystal back to us.
News vans rolled up. I was just, like, wow.
[reporter] Her engagement on social media gleaned information
that eventually helped lead police to arrests.
[Belinda] We were notified the night before
that Julio Heredia had been charged with my daughter's murder,
and that he was in custody.
It was like, "Thank you, Jesus. Thank you. They got him. They got him."
[Rick] You're looking at a murder charge, and you're that… Are you that confident? I'm looking at you.
I can tell you're not confident.
No, I'm sure about this. I'm thinking about other things.
[Rick] What are you thinking about? Anna?
-That kid she's carrying? -Yup.
[Rick] There's a lot of stuff in your life right now. How far along is she now?
-Four months. -[Rick] Four months?
-Little boy or little girl? Do you know? -No.
[Rick] How is she doing?
She's good.
[Rick] You got a four-month-old on the way.
Set the example and step up and be a man about this.
You made a mistake. Everybody makes mistakes. Some of them are bigger than others.
But right here, right now is the chance for you to make a change.
For you to be a different kind of a person, Julio.
You want to sleep on it tonight?
No, I just want to… Yeah, I want a freaking lawyer.
I want you to give me my rights. I want somebody to be right here.
[Rick] Now you want a lawyer? You can have an attorney if you want.
You wanna do that? That's fine.
-But now you got a lot to think about. -You don't understand me anyways.
[Diallo] I would describe Riverside as kind of the Wild West of the criminal justice system as far as here in Southern California.
of the criminal justice system as far as here in Southern California. An intense place to practice.
The DA's office, they have a reputation.
You know, we're aggressive about gang prosecutions.
So aggressive to the fact we're looking to put gang members to death.
You know, on our side we're representing Julio,
and trying to convey his humanity and his interests,
but they have to have a tough decision to a family who's lost somebody.
[Rick] Now we bring the family in,
and we talk with the DA's office about if it'll be the death penalty.
I know Belinda was very, very passionate. She wanted him to pay the ultimate price for it.
Um, and I don't blame her. I don't blame her at all.
[Belinda] Yeah, I hate him. I hate him.
I do.
There's… I can't think of anything in the world bad enough
that would be enough.
Capital cases, your whole mind frame is changed to saving a person's life.
So that person's entire life has to be investigated because ultimately, you're not just killing
that part of the person that committed the crime. You're killing all of them.
Their story has to be told. How they got to where they were.
You know, not excuses but explanations.
[chuckles] He was so small in this picture.
He was so tiny.
His big, old ears.
I remember them sending us out.
The papers that we have to fill out, like if you're 18 and older,
and if you want to go to the execution, you can.
Oh, my mom.
It was hard living with my mom.
You know, she was on drugs and alcohol, and…
I mean, I would pick stuff up off the floor, eating it
'cause we were so hungry.
So that brings… Seeing this picture brings back a lot of bad memories.
We didn't have food. We didn't have furniture.
Julio, he had to take care of all of us, getting money, working.
For me, the only father figure I ever had was Julio.
[Mario] You know, with Julio, we looked up to him.
We wanted to be like him. We would dress like him. [chuckles]
You know, we were proud.
We would go to school, and we'd tell everybody, "That's our cousin."
This is where we lived up here, and he lived over there across the street.
That was his last spot where, like, he actually, like, lived with his mom.
Uh, Julio was 14, 15, then.
I think he couldn't accept that his mom just didn't care to get them back.
You know, she didn't try to get them back.
See, this picture just reminds me, like, of when they started,
you know, going out and getting involved in all that stuff.
[Mario] He started hanging out with the older guys.
And those are guys who would let him in his house. And they gave him drugs.
And, you know, uh, they started having him do things
that he shouldn't have been doing.
Oh, this has everybody in it.
They all look so young in this picture.
[Mario] This guy stabbed him with this huge kitchen knife.
And Julio's skinny, so the knife, like, came out his back.
That's when I started realizing he wasn't, um, the same anymore.
Like, his joy was gone. It was, like, done, dead.
Nick even said, "Mom, I don't like this fucker."
He goes, "Yeah, I fucking don't like him."
"But, Mom, you got to think, when I was 17, I didn't give a fuck."
[Nick] I was into sports. I mean, playing football and going to ride my dirt bike.
And after Crystal was killed, I started having problems at school with fighting,
in a bad mood, and mad at the world, I guess I could say.
And he started messing up. He was angry. He wanted revenge.
And we were losing him to a gang.
-[interviewer] Which son? -Nicholas.
Yeah, like, I was from a gang, and we were enemies with the 5150s and stuff.
I just fit in right with them.
Like, fuck them fools too, you know? Like let's go look for them and…
[Belinda] Now I have the fear and worry about my son being killed in gang violence
and being a part of a gang, or killing somebody.
[Nick] When I was a juvenile, I was arrested a lot.
I mean, I have the gun case, then I'm up for assault with a firearm.
That's what I got out of prison for, and it's just not worth it.
You stay in denial a little bit.
You don't wanna believe that your child… could do something like that. Get a gun.
I'm like, "How did you get a gun? Where did you get a gun?"
This was my bottom.
This… This was Belinda's wake-up call.
I had to really start taking a good look at myself,
and why I was having all of these… these feelings,
and just being pissed off at the world.
And… where is the anger coming from?
What… What is it I'm mad at?
Well, I was mad at me. I was mad at me. I was disappointed in me.
Who's that? You guys, get down!
I think they're coming up the road again. Get behind the car, Ben. Hurry!
[dispatcher] Wait. Ma'am, hold on. Do you think he was a teenager?
[Belinda] The last day I used was the day Crystal was murdered.
Yeah. I was high.
-He was shorter than me. -[dispatcher] Thin, medium, heavy build? Uh. He… uh… Very…
Oh gosh, uh…
And that's all Crystal ever wanted from me.
"Mom, just get sober."
My heart's still pounding. I'm just like, "Oh my God. I can't believe this."
And I couldn't do it for her. I couldn't do it for her in life.
I have to learn to forgive myself.
And that's harder than forgiving… Julio Heredia.
It really is.
I had to say that.
[woman] Just memorials of all the murders in Riverside County.
[Belinda] Every single day, it's on the news.
It's just the names are changing.
I can understand where the drugs, gangs,
and they were all high as a kite that night too.
I can actually say, "There go I, but for the grace of God."
That was really the reason that we asked him to take the death penalty off the table.
I did the right thing for the first time in my life.
I did the right thing. Yeah.
If you've got gang members that are definitely loyal to their gang
and know the price that they pay if they snitch,
it's pretty rare that you get one, maybe two to be cooperative with us.
So that was huge.
[Manuel] By the time he hears the gunshot, he comes outside of the car.
He's coming out.
And at this time, I hear several other gunshot noises.
I was kind of scared because of the fact that…
I know how many people are in this organization.
And it's not something that you end.
[woman] You've seen Little Huero on meth? -[Manuel] Yeah. -[woman] You've never smoked with him?
-[Manuel] Yeah. -[woman] You've never smoked with him?
[Manuel] Never smoked with him, never seen him do it, but I know he's on it, his eyeballs are all opened up.
but I know he's on it, his eyeballs are all opened up.
It was just crazy to see them testifying against my brother, you know?
'Cause they grew up with us, you know?
They were always there. They were always at our house.
[Will] So I saw when Little Huero dumped the first shot. I didn't see the other shots. I saw the first one.
I did feel hurt, you know? Because we would hang out every day,
and I just thought, for you to make up lies just to get out of something.
[interviewer] Did you have interactions with them? Did they talk to you?
Not at all. They were just looking at me, but I didn't want to look at them.
[Amalia] I think it was Manuel's crying, um,
when he was testifying, so…
[Manuel] I know he didn't mean to do all those things he did.
Like how everyone in this world doesn't mean to do it.
[Amalia] The comments that the judge made were really harsh.
"Mr. Heredia is not a good person."
"He is a violent, cold-blooded murderer."
"And he is going to pay for what he has done."
[Manuel] We lived in the fast lane.
We did things that you can't even think of.
For those things, we get nightmares.
[Justin] I live it every day. I can't… drive down the street where I grew up…
[voice breaks] without flashing back.
[Robbie] I've had dreams about her, just…
I just hold tight to all my memories.
[Jaimie] It was about a month ago. Crystal was standing there.
And she was in this white dress.
And then I woke up.
[Manuel] Now it's going to be difficult forgiving myself.
Mom and Dad always try to protect me,
always try to have something good for me.
And I'm… I'm trying not to let them down again.
I want to have kids. Raise a family.
You know, do something.
[Belinda] It was personal between William Sotelo and I.
It's not over until he's apprehended.
And I feel like I just need him in custody so Crystal can rest.
Let's see what William Sotelo…
Oh, and Unity.
It shows me that wherever he is, he's not doing too badly.
This is beautiful. The High Priestess.
Now this would represent me.
And it shows that I'm wise enough to take the steps to move forward in my life.
And I'm to listen to my intuition and have patience
and consider carefully what I want before I act.
And then the Justice card.
He's ours. They're going to get him one day.
Better times are coming. Yes.
[Belinda] Justice and revenge.
Yes, they are just about the same thing.
where the heroic knight saves the damsel in distress.
This is not one of them.
[King] There it is.
Form up!
Let's kill the beast.
For glory! Hyah!
Be on guard.
Form the line!
Hold!
[Floria] The last I could find.
[Elodie] Did you take the tapestries into town like Father asked?
[Floria] This morning.
We should take the furs too, and the drapes.
Not the drapes!
You hate that pattern in your room anyway.
They serve a purpose.
Floria, our people are freezing.
And starving.
Who'd come this far north?
[Floria] Elodie, why are they leaving?
[Elodie] There's nothing left for them here, Floria.
[man 1] I don't have enough. Please, I'm hungry.
[woman 1] For food, join the line!
-[man 2] Keep to one side. -[man 3] I'm starving.
All right then.
[man 4] Get off! It's mine!
-Hey! Give me back my food. -Get off of me, old man!
You've had enough!
[woman 2] Share this with your sister. Go on.
-Could you see who it was? -[guard] A stranger, my lady.
They may take whatever wood they can carry.
-I'll see to it. -Come on, Flor.
-[woman 2] Move on. -[woman 3] Yes.
-[man 5] Get in line. -Give it to me.
-[woman] I want to meet her first. -Father?
You must be Elodie.
I am.
She will do.
-[Red Priestess] We await your decision. -Thank you, Your Holiness.
Please, this way.
Father, what's happening?
Who is that?
Stepmother?
Well, what is it?
[Lord Bayford] From the Queen of Aurea.
A proposal.
-Oh, my goodness. -[Lord Bayford] Huh…
-I have made a match. -May I?
[Lord Bayford] Uh-huh.
He is a prince.
A prince?
I know you've always wished to travel, as did your mother.
Go. See the world.
This man, he has a fleet of ships, carriages full of gold.
That's no reason to marry.
We need this.
Our stores are empty.
We will not make it to the thaw.
Your people need you.
Hey.
This is who we are.
[sailor 1] Get to the port side.
[sailor 2] Port side.
Elodie, what's the matter?
Nothing.
Father says it's natural to be nervous
about meeting your new husband and his family.
They're strangers.
I've never heard of the Kingdom of Aurea until Father sprang this on me.
[sailor 1] Mind the lines.
Oh!
Are you crazy? What are you two doing up there?
Come down here.
Come on.
This is how you want your prince to meet you?
Scared, cold as a corpse.
Nose all drippy and wet.
What have I been telling you this entire trip?
-[both] First impressions are everything. -Hmm.
[sailor 2] Come on, lift up.
-[exhales sharply] -[sailor blowing horn]
[sailor 3] Look at that.
I have good news, girls.
The captain informs me we approach Aurea's coastline.
It should be any time now.
Father.
What in the world?
Looks almost… almost like a--
A dragon.
-It's okay. -[Lady Bayford chuckles]
Oh, my heavens. [chuckles]
It's magnificent.
My lords, my ladies,
be welcome to the Kingdom of Aurea.
The royal family is at prayer,
but word has been sent of your arrival.
In the meantime, your rooms have been made ready.
If you will follow me.
[Floria] Is this a dream?
If so, can I move in and never wake up?
If you want these people to think we belong here,
you can't act so easily impressed.
What do you think, Ellie? Hmm?
I think I had a rather limited definition of wealthy.
[chamberlain] I pray this is to your liking, my lady.
A bath has been drawn
and supper has been carried hence.
At first light, I shall return to convey you
to meet His Royal Highness.
Henry, Prince of Aurea.
[Lady Bayford] Floria, stop touching everything.
Is something wrong?
-I just hope he's kind. -Hmm.
-And well-read. -Yeah.
Handsome.
Let's all give Elodie some privacy.
She can use the time to settle in, as we all could.
Oh, indeed.
Come.
[maid] M'lady.
Everyone's waiting.
Ellie?
I can't sleep.
I still can't believe you're going to live here from now on.
You and me both.
I keep thinking, if only Mother were alive,
I could just talk to her about all of this.
Perhaps you could talk to Stepmother.
She means well, even if she is a bit…
-Exhausting? -[chuckles]
It'll be fine. You'll see.
You're Elodie. You can do anything.
[Queen Isabelle] What is your greatest strength?
[Elodie] I always tell the truth, Your Majesty.
[Queen Isabelle] Some might call that a weakness.
Do you know your heart?
[Elodie] I believe I do, Your Majesty.
[Queen Isabelle] And what is it telling you now?
In truth, it is beating too loudly for me to hear much of anything, Your Majesty.
[Queen Isabelle] Arise, Elodie.
I'm Henry.
Very pleased to finally meet you, my lady.
We all are.
My son understates our joy.
And if I may say so,
your father has understated your beauty.
I've never known my father to understate much of anything, Your Majesty.
[chuckles] I see she arrives with some wit.
Should you want it or not, Your Majesty.
And you must be Floria.
It seems even a harsh clime can grow the fairest flowers.
I love your castle.
I mean, I really love it.
Like, a lot…
Your Majesty.
You are to make yourself at home, child.
We elders have some trivial matters like weddings to attend to.
[Lord Bayford] Yes…
Your correspondence made mention of some particulars
you wish to discuss in person.
-The two of us can confer in private. -Yes.
It's nothing to bore our young people with.
They have a far more important task at hand.
They must get to know each other.
[Henry] Do you have any questions of me?
[Elodie] Questions of what subject?
You may choose the subject.
What do you think about me?
Pardon?
Well, you seem disinterested at best, which is your prerogative,
but I'd like to know if the person I'm being guilted into marrying
truly likes me or not.
If my attitude offends you, I do apologize. It was not my intent.
However, I was unaware that, um, you were being guilted into anything.
The land where I come from is exactly how your mother explained.
Harsh and barren.
This union will save us.
I've made my peace with it.
My happiness is a small price to pay for the future of my people.
Is something wrong?
It's just…
In the letter you sent in advance of your arrival, you sounded different.
[chuckles] Different. In what way?
Far more, um…
flowery.
Maybe that's because my stepmother dictated most of it
and my sister's idea was the heart…
-The heart. -Mmm.
I thought it was some sort of provincial insignia.
You actually drew this?
Hold on. It's a maze, isn't it?
"I hope you'll get to know my heart."
That is very clever.
I used to make them for Floria when she was little.
-May I ask you another question? -Certainly.
Do they always follow you so closely?
This is them giving me space.
That must be tiring.
It is, actually.
I saw some horses being left unattended at the stables.
Do you ride?
-[horses whinny] -[riveting music playing]
[Elodie] Hyah!
-Where did you learn to ride like that? -My mother.
Which way now?
Well, depends on what you want to see.
Everything.
Very well.
What happened in there?
Speak already.
-Is the wedding still on? -Aye.
You settled on a fair bride price?
More gold than I could ever imagine.
Then why do you look so?
No, it's nothing. I'm fine.
Tell me, you didn't say anything to embarrass us.
No, I did not.
Because it's very important that our two families get along.
Not only for Elodie's sake, but for ours.
I said, nothing! Nothing's wrong.
I saw something, high on the mountain last night.
Torches.
You saw that?
I couldn't sleep.
It was an ancient ceremony.
Or rather, one of three.
They're very significant to my family.
For our whole kingdom, really. They, um…
They honor our ancestors.
That's why my mother chose these dates for our wedding.
[Elodie] It is quite beautiful.
[Henry] Yes, I suppose.
I really don't have anything else to compare it to.
May I confide in you something?
Yes.
My greatest wish is to go see the world.
Really set out and see it, you know?
I do, actually.
It's my life's dream.
For as long as I can remember, I've longed to explore the distant lands.
The ones you only read about.
Perhaps, one day, we will.
Perhaps.
[woman] And the orange in this area.
[Lady Bayford] Everything's so beautiful, Your Majesty.
Well, I'm glad you approve.
Very elegant.
You have impeccable taste.
Everything is just so exquisite.
I'm sorry, is there something I can help you with?
I just thought we might become better acquainted,
seeing as we're about to be family.
Ah, this must be very exciting for you.
Your father was a rope maker, was he not?
The finest in the city.
And here you are. You've climbed so high.
Still, one mustn't forget one's station.
Nor place undue import
on what is ultimately a transaction born of necessity.
Uh… "Necessity"?
Well, your family needs money.
My family needs a bride.
What we don't need is more family.
I wish all the best for Henry and Eloise.
-I merely-- -Elodie.
Pardon?
My stepdaughter. Her name is Elodie.
That's what I said.
Good day, Lady Bayford.
It's perfect.
Everything in here is so perfect.
[Elodie] Stepmother.
Is something the matter?
Elodie,
I know we haven't always been close,
but I need you to listen to me now.
This wedding… is a mistake.
[scoffs] What?
I don't understand.
These people, I don't trust them.
It's hard to explain, but a mother knows these things.
Only yesterday, you were enamored by this place.
Floria.
I was wrong.
They may be royalty, but that doesn't make them good people.
[Elodie] Well…
-What does Father think? -He refuses to talk about it.
And when I try to tell him my worries, he snaps at me.
-Because you're being unreasonable. -That's enough, Flor.
Elodie, I swear that I only want what's best for you.
Am I interrupting something?
No.
Just…
girl talk.
Well, tomorrow's a big day, and these girls, they need their rest.
Think about what I said. There's still time.
Time for what?
[Lady Bayford] I hope you know what you're doing.
Good night, my angels.
-Good night, Father. -Good night, Father.
Good night.
[Floria] Wow.
[priest] You may kiss the bride.
I present my son and new daughter, Elodie, Princess of Aurea.
Goodbye, Father.
[softly] I hope I'm half as beautiful someday as you are today.
Twice as beautiful.
-I love you. -I love you.
Hey! Hey, hey!
[Elodie] Where are we going?
[Henry] Remember I told you about those ancient ceremonies up on the mountain?
[Elodie] Yes.
[Henry] We're going to pay homage to my ancestors.
Welcome, Princess.
For generations, it has been our task, our duty,
to protect our people.
The price is dear, but so too the reward.
So, tonight,
you join a long line of women who have helped to build this kingdom.
When our ancestors first lay claim to this island,
they found they were not its sole inhabitants.
A creature dwelt here first.
The last of its kind.
With savage bloodlust,
the beast left its lair and set upon the village.
So the king gathered his soldiers to avenge his people.
But their steel was no match for the monster,
and each man met his end.
Each save one.
For the king, the beast had a far worse fate in store.
Give up his three beloved daughters and the island could be shared.
A cruel torture.
He adored his daughters,
but his duty to his subjects was stronger.
And so, a pact was made.
The three princesses met their end in the belly of the beast,
and a kingdom was born.
It is this sacrifice we commemorate every generation.
A tradition going back centuries.
Your hand, child.
A legacy of honor and duty you now inherit, Princess Elodie of Aurea.
Let our two lines mingle and fast become one.
She is now of royal blood.
To ensure that our kingdom thrives forevermore,
pay your due to the realm.
[softly] Toss the coin into the chasm.
The ceremony is now complete.
You may make your return.
I'm supposed to carry you back.
I'm fine with walking, really.
Floria would love this part.
Close your eyes.
I've got you.
[softly] I'm sorry.
[Elodie screams] No!
-[grunts] -[vines, branches cracking]
Help me!
Help!
Is anyone there?!
That's not mine.
I am the sacrifice.
I am the sacrifice?
-[faint screech] -[gasps softly]
You poor thing.
What happened to you?
Give me strength, Mother.
[dragon] Mother?
[dragon] Your name, little bird?
Speak your name.
Elodie.
El-o-die.
Exciting.
What do you want?
I want… what is promised.
What is owed.
Every generation, your kind must pay.
[softly] My kind?
The scent of royalty betrays you.
It's in your blood.
Now, my favorite part.
-Run. -[screams]
[dragon] Did I hurt you?
Quiet now?
[chuckles softly] A clever one.
The last one was over so quick.
[whimpers] No.
Mother wanted you to fight.
[weakly] No. No.
[Lord Bayford] He is a prince.
[Queen Isabelle] They must get to know each other.
[Henry] My greatest wish is to go see the world.
[Elodie] Perhaps, one day we will.
One for the dress.
Don't worry.
I won't hurt you.
Almost caught you, little bird.
You hide now, like all the others.
It makes no difference.
This story always ends the same.
[Elodie] V.
Victoria.
Beatrice.
Artemis.
Genevive.
Fatima.
Carlotta.
How many?
Did anyone make it out?
-[flesh squelches] -[groans]
Please, don't.
Somebody…
It's a lie.
[groans] Get off.
I'm deeply sorry…
for underestimating you.
A map.
[sighs] Now, where am I?
A tree.
The entrance cave.
Following down into the bird cave.
Through the twisted tunnel…
reaching water.
The glowworm cave.
Keep following down.
I am here.
How do I escape?
Is this it?
Did a princess make it out?
Three ways. Take the middle fork.
Music note.
Crystals.
Go on.
And then… I am free.
The middle fork.
-[dragon growls softly] -[gasps]
Music.
Crystals.
This is it.
Wish me luck.
You made it out.
No!
[dragon] Elodie.
Fly, little bird.
-[horse whinnies] -[gasps]
Hello.
Hello!
I'm here! Help!
Help!
Hello!
There is no way out, Princess.
Not for any of you.
Three were taken.
Three must be given.
-[dragon screeches] -[screams]
[man] Elodie!
[dragon] What's this?
[man] Elodie!
Elodie!
Move on.
I've done what you paid for, milord. I'll just wait up top.
You'll do no such thing.
I hired you to guide us to her.
No one leaves here without my daughter.
[man 2] Elodie!
Elodie!
[Queen Isabelle] A creature dwelt here first.
The last of its kind.
It's a lie.
Three taken.
Slay the vile young.
Form the line!
Please, spare me.
Show mercy.
I will give you anything.
[dragon] Death is not enough for you.
You will know my pain.
[man 1] Elodie!
Elodie!
Elodie!
Elodie!
Be quiet. She can hear you.
I warned you. It's too late. The beast lurks in its lair.
-It's surely taken her there to devour-- -This lair. Where is it?
Sir, your daughter's been down here nigh on too long.
She's almost certainly been killed.
[man 2] Elodie!
I'm told some have tried to hunt the beast.
For its blood.
Nonsense.
Why are you here?
I'm here for my daughter.
Father.
Father.
Please.
I beg of you.
It's not my mercy that you should seek.
Call her.
She's alive?
Elodie's still alive?
I smell her.
Hiding.
Watching.
Call her.
No.
Call her.
Elodie.
Can you hear me?
I have… I have made a horrible, horrible mistake.
To sacrifice the one thing I love most.
To trade your life
for the good of my people.
I thought that I could take the gold.
That I could live with myself.
My choice.
But I can't.
I can't.
[dragon] Tell her to come to you.
Last chance.
Elodie. Hear me.
I am your father. You will obey me.
I order you.
Do not come out!
No.
No!
Ellie.
Use the ropes.
Your stepmother and Floria,
they wait for you at the ship.
Forgive me.
Go! Go! Go!
Go.
That damn girl. I knew she was trouble.
-Where are you going? -To fix this.
-[guard 1] Stop. -[guard 2] Stand back.
Elodie.
[soldier] Open up!
-Get out of the way! -[guard grunts]
Get out!
Seize her.
You can't!
-No! She's just a child! -[Floria] No!
You promised us a daughter.
-Stepmother! -No!
Floria! [gasps]
Elodie.
Stepmother.
-Elodie. -Stepmother.
[Lady Bayford] Oh!
Thank God.
Are you all right?
I can manage.
Where's Floria?
They took her to the caves in your place.
I tried to stop them from taking your sister.
I have to save her.
No, I'll go. I can find her.
It may be too late.
No.
Not if I can help it.
Your father…
Go.
[whimpering] Please. Let me go!
Please let me go.
No, don't do this.
Mother, enough! She's too young.
A prince protects his kingdom, without hesitation or complaint.
Give me your hand.
I cannot do this. She's just a child.
You're weak.
No! Please don't do this to me!
Get off of me!
Let go! Off of me!
Throw her in.
Floria!
Floria!
Floria!
[Elodie] I'm coming for you, Flor.
[dragon] My little ones…
They did not let you live.
Nor shall I let Elodie.
Your sister will come for you.
There she is now.
Hello, Floria. Floria, can you hear me?
Wake up!
We need to hurry.
Floria!
Ellie.
Elodie, you're alive.
Okay. I'm going to get you out of here.
My leg. I hurt it when I fell.
We don't have time, Flor.
No, no, no. Not yet.
What now?
You have to hide quickly.
What about you?
I must tell her the truth.
Come on.
Where are you hiding?
[Elodie softly] Dragon.
[dragon] That won't kill me,
but it will make me angry.
Good.
I'm angry too.
We have both been lied to.
They said you set upon their village.
That the king came only to defend his people.
He came unprovoked.
I know what they did.
I know they killed your children.
"They"? You!
Your kind, your blood.
No!
My daughters were the last of my line.
So, I will take their daughters until my final breath.
Except you haven't. We are not their daughters.
More lies.
Ellie!
Now, you will know my daughters' pain.
I am not one of them!
I smell it in your blood.
El-o-die.
Accept your fate…
as I have mine.
We are to die alone.
No.
I have an army with me.
Every innocent woman whose life was stolen down here.
Your kind were never innocent.
Then go ahead.
Show me your fire.
Well?
What are you waiting for?
Burn me.
Burn me!
My sister had this too.
All of us did.
That is how they make us royal.
That is the blood you smell.
They fooled you.
You've been killing innocent daughters just like they did.
Then, end it.
No.
I'm through doing what I'm told.
Elodie.
You must believe me. I haven't slept a moment since--
Since you tried to kill my sister?
[Henry] I had no choice.
Don't you dare explain yourself to this…
this commoner.
Is she to be the third?
Princess number three.
She's the last, and then I'll be free to marry whoever I--
That's enough, Henry.
You know nothing of what we've endured.
You know nothing of our story.
Take your family
and run.
[man] Come. Let's go.
I will offer you all one last chance to do the same.
No?
You insolent creature.
You think we ought to fear you now?
Why?
Because you somehow managed to escape the dragon?
It's not me you should fear.
This is the end of your story.
[woman] Run!
-[woman] It's the dragon! -[man] Run!
No!
[sailor 1] Someone give me a hand with this barrel.
[sailor 2] Let's be sharp there, lads.
[Lady Bayford] You can't be serious.
[Elodie] But I am.
We'll run it together.
We've got a bounty of supplies.
Enough to get us through this freeze and the next.
Oh, Elodie.
You're the only person I trust to look after our people, Mother.
Can I help too?
Floria.
I'm counting on it.
[Floria] Stepmother. Stepmother, come and see this.
[Lady Bayford] Oh, wide heavens!
[sailor] My lady, what course shall we steer?

November 9th, 1989...
Mum.
You just ruined my tape.
I'm going to work.
Don't go to bed too late, you have class tomorrow, OK?
OK.
Nico, have you recorded my tape?
Yes...
I LOVE YOU, MUM
Ms. Weiss.
Ms. Weiss.
Wait!
Wait!
No!
Help!
Help!
I need help!
Nico!
I need help!
Good morning, my love.
Hey...
Hey...
Come on...
How did you sleep?
I don't like this house, it's cold.
You've only been here one night.
I want my room.
Well, you'll get it soon. Alright?
Hey, come on, let's go!
Hello, darling, are you here?
Yes, I brought my flight forward.
But I have to spend all day in meetings, because they want to review the targets,
they say we don't sell enough insurance and all that...
I'll be a little late.
Well... Like always...
I'll make it up to you... now confess.
Alright, I slept with her.
-You slept together? -Yes, we slept together.
I knew it. Put her on.
Wait.
Gloria, talk to Daddy.
Hello, Dad.
Hello, how's my little monster?
Everything smells like paint.
You'll see, soon it will be much better than in the city. -OK? -OK.
-Has the meeting started? -They are waiting for you.
A new client, Ms. Velazquez, is coming tomorrow.
-OK, make a note. -Alright.
Honey, can I get back to Mum?
-He wants to talk to you. -Yes?
OK.
Why don't you tell Aitor to come for dinner?
I'll tell him now.
Hey, I love you.
I love you too.
What are you doing, Mum?
The storm.
It's the same,
the same as years ago.
Well, I'm going to work. I'll be right back.
I'm going to work. I'll be right back.
Don't smoke too much, OK?
Careful.
-I wanted to ask. -Go ahead.
We're leaving.
Can you lock up the door and leave the key in the house upfront?
Good morning, neighbour!
-Good morning! -How's it going?
If I was a passenger and saw you in that, I swear I'd get off the plane.
Where's your husband?
He spent the night in Seville.
-Oh, yes? -Yes.
He wants to make dinner tonight, what about it?
I think he's incredibly cheeky, but... -Stop now! -But...
Besides that... I fly to Marseilles and this evening I think I'll be here, so...
and this evening I think I'll be here, so...
Tell your mother to come.
-Sure? -It'd be great.
-Sure? -It'd be great. -I'd like to see her. -Alright.
That's all.
-Ciao. -Ciao.
Commander!

with an approximate duration of 72 hours.

there was a very similar storm, with a symmetrical structure...
I didn't know you were back.
My holidays were short but intense.
What happened here? Did a tropical mosquito bite you?
Or did you bring someone home in your suitcase?
How's the new house?
When did I tell you we've moved?
Half the hospital knows.
Good, honestly it has all been very quick,
the owner had left the house years ago, she was in a hurry to sell it.
It needs some work but that's all, we can't complain.
But I do. They're going to open my head.
Don't worry.
Dr. Fell is the best specialist in craniotomy in the hospital.
Hello.
Ready, Mr. Mendoza?
Here we go.
Good morning.
Hello, Doctor.
Congratulations on the article.
Did you read it?
What happened with Ms. Blanco?
She developed "alequestesia".
Injury of the spinothalamic tract?
No, she required an anterolateral cordotomy.
Right.
The more I know you, the less I understand that you quit medicine.
Well, I had Gloria, and...
I don't like to do things halfway.
So you're lucky
that I quit medicine.
Now I would be the best neuro-surgeon in this hospital.
Hello!
How are you?
Can Greta come home?
If her mum is OK with it...
I'm sure she is. I'll call her, OK?
Girls... what did we agree on?
Your mother is taking you to the dentist.
Ah, alright, OK, OK.
I get it...
Are you coming, storyteller?
-Ciao, Miranda. -Bye, Greta.
Can you see anything?
I promise. I can't see anything.
-Sure you're not cheating? -No.
Wait.
Nearly...
Ready? Yes.
You wanna try? Come on!
Hello.
You're going to give me a heart attack. When did you arrive?
-Half an hour ago. -Half an hour?
What are you doing?
Organising the books to make our library.
What's this?
Look.
You were dating her when we met, right?
And that face?
What face?
-You're jealous. -No.
I saw it in your eyes, you're a little jealous.
No, no. You did get a little bit jealous.
You did get a little bit jealous.
She was very pretty, she is very pretty. -Show me?
Ursula, maybe I'll call her one of these days.
So pretty.
What happened here?
-Nothing. I was there... -With what?
That sign,
I was putting it up and I cut myself.
Did you disinfect it?
Honey, it's a very small cut,
I disinfected it, and used a band aid, Dr. Roy.
You know that I always liked the idea that after graduation everyone would call you
that after graduation everyone would call you Dr. Vera Roy? -Alright, enough.
Dr. Vera Roy? -Alright, enough. -Alright. -Yes.
-Alright. -Yes. Let's go.
What's this?
Incredible.
This camera must be at least 20 or 30 years old.
Of course. The tapes.
This has been here since the 80's.
Why don't we call Gloria and see if it works?
Do you know that this tape was recorded on today's exact date, but in 1989?
was recorded on today's exact date, but in 1989?
Seriously? You just ruined my tape.
-Put another one on. -That was the last.
Did you like it?
Who's going to keep it?
I'll start making dinner, because they will be here soon.
Yes, I'll take a shower.
Are you hungry?
Absolute normality on the streets of East Berlin, at nightfall.
Only a few onlookers have come to Brandenburg Gate.
What's this?

I don't know. But there's no tape in.
No.
Besides, now the channels don't broadcast in analogue.
...has opened informally for all Germans...
-It doesn't make any sense, David. -No?
A television signal from 25 years ago?
Did you say hi to Clara?
I swear, the TV came alive.
Came alive?
-Came alive? -Came alive!
Are you listening to your crazy husband? Came alive?
Are you still talking about the TV?
Of course we are.
-Cover your ears, honey. -Why?
I'm going to tell Mum a secret.
Mum and I don't have secrets.
Not even one?
Let's see... What don't you understand?
-I was the better catch. -Yeah right!
Stop listening in!
I was a better catch and you let me go. Why?
What can we say?
Why? Because some things are destined to be how they are.
Alright? -What is this? That hand. -What's going on?
-What is this? That hand. -What's going on? 5 minutes and you're holding hands.
5 minutes and you're holding hands. Don't exaggerate.
-Who wants meat? -Clara.
By the way, why are you still using that toaster of a TV?
It's just that, I don't know... Can't you afford to buy...?
Hilarious.
We were watching the tapes we found, that's all. There was a boy singing.
A boy singing, eh?
-Do you want some? -Sure.
Thank you.
That boy was Nico Lasarte.
He was my best friend.
He loved playing the guitar
and always told me that he would be a rock star.
Mum always took us to school together.
Until...
the neighbour from next-door -killed his wife. -Aitor.
-killed his wife. -Aitor.
And Nico saw it.
Aitor, enough.
Then he was run over.
On a night like this, with a storm.
Remember that the next day
a lightning hit the facade of the school, by the clock,
and we had no power and no class for a week.
and we had no power and no class for a week. Shut up!
Shut up.
Stop it.
You're frightening the girl. Can't you see?
It's alright, it's just a lightning storm.
it's just a lightning storm.
It'll go away, you'll see...
Wanna know a secret?
Wanna know a secret? Lie down.
Look,
when I was 7 years old,
I was really, really frightened by storms, just like you,
you know what I did?
Look,
I took Granny's music box
and watched the ballerina.
I watched her dance and I forgot about everything.
I watched her dance, dance,
until I fell asleep.
You wanna try?
ANGEL PRIETO COMMITS SUICIDE IN HIS CELL
Does it hurt?
Why don't you get it checked?
He killed himself 3 months after entering prison. Here it says he owned an abattoir
Here it says he owned an abattoir
and was going to bury his wife underneath it.
Who confesses something he was going to do
but didn't because he was arrested first?
Why don't we change the subject?
Someone who says what he would have done but didn't do it, that's not a common killer.
but didn't do it, that's not a common killer.
Are you a psychologist now?
No, but it's strange. Don't you think so?
Are they dirty?
I love when you make that face, when you don't like something.
Your nose wrinkles, turns up... -No -Yes.
-No -Yes. Your nose goes like this, wrinkled. Like a rabbit face.
-Oh, yes? -A tiny rabbit.
-An ugly rabbit. -What's this?
Have you been smoking?
Are you controlling me?
What?
Are you controlling me?
Come on, honey, I'm joking.
You always fall for it, you know me.
I like jokes.
Yesterday in the hotel, in Seville,
-I went to the café... -You don't have to explain.
-I went to the café... -You don't have to explain. I had one and dumped the rest.
-I promise. Let's do something. -OK.
Look.
Done.
-Nothing happened. -OK.
-Like nothing happened. Really? -Yes, yes.
...we're able to offer the emergency story that we announced previously
which has just arrived this minute from Berlin.
...the border has opened informally
for all Germans from the East that want to come here to the West.
In 27 years, it is the first time that the Berlin Wall no longer exists
it is the first time that the Berlin Wall no longer exists for citizens from the other Germany.
November 9th, 1989,
is a day for the history of Germany and Europe as a whole.
This couple has just arrived and can't believe it.
They just had to present their identity card,
and they received a stamp.
It is their first time in the West, but they don't intend to stay.
At home, in the East, on the other side,
their son is waiting, and they work at 8 am.
Nico, I'm going to work.
Mum, the camera broke.
Don't go to bed late, you have class tomorrow, OK?
OK.
Nico, have you recorded my tape?
Yes.
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Hello?
Can you see me?
Yes.
Yes, I can see you.
How do you do it?
-How do I do what? -Hold on!
That sign is the same as the Valpineda station.
What?
It's the same,
just worn out.
It's the same one.
How do you have it?
We stole it.
My husband and I stole it.
I don't understand.
Aitor, your neighbour, introduced me to David, my husband,
I met Aitor at Valpineda station. Aitor Medina!
Wait, wait!
His mother takes you to school.
Do you know why I know?
I know because it already happened.
What already happened?
-What is it? -Shouting, outside.
Wait, wait, wait.
Nico!
Nico, come back!
How do you know my name?
You used to live here.
Here, where?
Something's wrong next door. Don't go, please, you shouldn't go.
Don't go, please, you shouldn't go. Wait.
Am I dreaming?
No. Wait. Look what I have, look.
Look.
See? See?
My tapes. How did you get those?
Nico, I live in your house.
This is your house, in 25 years time.
This is your house, in 25 years time. What?
Look.
I'm going to show you something.
Look, see?
CHILD KILLED IN VALPINEDA
This is you, if you go outside.
No... -It's a trick. How do you do it? -No.
No, no! It's not, it's real.
-This is real. -You're lying.
Nico, wait! I know what's going to happen at your school tomorrow.
I know what's going to happen at your school tomorrow.
Lightning is going to hit the clock at the entrance,
the entire school will lose power and the classes will be cancelled.
If you stay in your room, you'll see I'm right,
but if you go outside, tomorrow you will be dead.
Nico, Nico, Nico, please,
please don't go, don't go outside,
Nico please, please, wait! Wait!
Stay inside! Nico, please don't go outside.
Don't go, a car will hit you!
When you cross the road it will hit you!
Nico, please! Please, no!
Yes?
Maria, it's Clara, did I wake you?
No. I'm just back from work.
I don't feel well, my brother will bring the kids to school, OK?
Alright, don't worry.
Feel better soon.
Why are you awake?
Aitor's mother isn't well, her brother will bring you to school, OK?
Nico.
Mum, I dreamed without sleeping.
A woman from the future spoke to me through the TV.
Vera! They're waiting for you in the OR.
Why is he here?
Mr. Mendoza has cerebrovascular insufficiency.
Yes, Dr. Fell operated on him yesterday.
Mr. Mendoza is your patient.
What?
Vera. We need to open him up now.
Dr. Roy, are you ready to get dressed?
What did you call me?
Sorry?
What's happening here?
What is this? What are you doing?
Dr. Roy. Are you alright?
Come on, we're late.
Nico, careful with the skateboard, the other day...
I'll be back at 5, OK?
What happened, uncle Roman?
I don't know. Let's ask.
Excuse me, miss. Is there a problem?
The storm caused an electrical fault, there's no power. Class is suspended.
Oh...
Come on kids, let's go home.
Hi Greta, have you seen Gloria?
Gloria who?
Gloria, my daughter. I'm her mum. Don't you remember me?
I'm her mum. Don't you remember me? No.
Hello, Miranda.
Pablo, go to class.
Can I help you?
Yes, I'm looking for Gloria. Can I see her a minute?
Gloria...
Gloria, Gloria Ortiz. Gloria is... Miranda, I'm Vera!
I'm sorry, I don't know you.
I'm looking for my daughter.
Class is suspended.
Nico forgot his keys and his mother's asleep.
Clara, I have to go to the airport.
Go on, kids!
Hi Lidia. I'm here to see David.
Ms. Velazquez? He's waiting in his office. Go through.
David!
What's happening?
Lidia doesn't recognise me.
I went to Gloria's school, she's not there.
They say she's not a student.
Her teacher doesn't know me
and her friend Greta doesn't know who she is either.
Where did you leave Gloria? Sorry. You're not Ms. Velazquez, right?
David, enough, really. Really, that's enough. I'm really tired...
Really, that's enough. I'm really tired...
Son of a bitch! Damn German. Who is German!
I believed you for a second! -You were great! Brilliant! -That's enough, David!
-You were great! Brilliant! -That's enough, David! -Not funny. -Don't touch.
David, it's me! Quit the fucking joke, David!
-Tell me where Gloria is. -Enough.
Who the hell are you and who is Gloria?
Gloria is our daughter!
Nico told me that last night he heard shouting in Mr. Prieto's house.
A woman screamed, it was scary.
Maybe it was Ms. Weiss. What do you think, Mum?
Did you see or hear anything else, Nico?
No, because the TV...
I looked out the window, but nothing.
We spied from my room, and you know what?
The blinds are down and Bruno is tied to the shed, howling.
Mr. Prieto always feeds him in the morning, but not today.
Aitor,
do you believe in time travel?
POLICE STATION
What can I say?
I didn't start this.
I don't know why David, or my daughter's school
I don't know why David, or my daughter's school act like I'm someone I'm not.
I know it seems like I'm lying, or crazy,
but the only thing I can think of is that it's a type of joke.
Can you help me?
Yes, I can help you,
but first I need to ask you some questions.
When was the last time you saw your daughter?
Last night.
She was scared,
she was frightened of the storm.
And the man you say is your husband?
David Ortiz is my husband.
What is the last thing you remember with him?
Last night, too.
Your nose wrinkles up...
Before bed... -Yes? -Like a rabbit. He lied about something silly.
He'd been smoking.
Nothing else?
I don't understand the questions.
I'm trying to see it.
I think we're wasting time.
Vera.
If you want me to help you, you have to help me to understand.
The smallest details.
Alright.
Before everything changed, what is the last thing you remember?
The story of the boy who lived in our house.
A neighbour of Aitor Medina, our friend.
Aitor told us that he died.
Hit by a car running out of another house.
A man... it all sounds sinister,
A man... it all sounds sinister, a man killed his wife, and...
the boy found out.
Continue, please.
Then...
Then I think I dreamed about him.
He appeared on an old television, and...
Hello?
Before he died, I tried to save him.
Can you hear me? I tried to warn him, to save him.
Do you remember the boy's name?
Nico Lasarte.
And then...
Something very strange happened.
Nico, please, please, no...
I don't remember anything else.
All I can say right now is that you are confused.
We have verified that...
you don't live where you said, you're not married to David Ortiz.
There is no birth certificate for your daughter.
She officially was not born.
We haven't found a single photo of her.
You don't have any.
Nobody has ever seen her, Vera.
The life you speak of
only exists in your mind.
Hello?
Are you there?
Answer me!
Here's the passport, ticket and Marks.
Thank you.
How is she, Doctor?
Good, this is the last test.
The results don't show any anatomic alteration.
Your brain's activity is optimal,
so we can dismiss any neurological impairment.
He was your first intervention leading a surgical team.
You extracted a meningioma from his brain.
Whatever you know about him, here is the answer.
It's true.
David had a meningioma removed, I remember.
But it wasn't me, I don't operate.
You're the neurosurgeon, I wasn't even in the post-operative
You're the neurosurgeon, I wasn't even in the post-operative because I had the flu. Monica took over.
because I had the flu. Monica took over.
Come with me.
This is your office.
Look around and you will remember.
You're the best neurosurgeon in the hospital.
You joined my team before finishing your speciality.
It's impossible that all my memories are a distortion.
You should go home. The surroundings will help you remember.
Gloria is my daughter.
Lorena García.
She died twelve days ago, in theatre.
It had never happened you before.
Nobody wanted to operate on her, but you took the risk.
It was an impossible case, even for you.
They prescribed sedatives, and a few days of rest.
You returned this morning for Mr. Mendoza's operation,
but we can extend your leave.
Vera, you blocked out Lorena García,
but speak of Gloria Ortiz, an imaginary girl you give life to.
You made up David Ortiz as your husband
because you've joined your first patient to your last.
Your mind has drawn a circle.
There must be another explanation.
Which?
Where are you going? Vera!
What are you doing?
What is it, Vera? Where are you going?
-You're frightened... -No, no...
I'm not scared. I'm starting to understand many things, really.
What?
The strange things,
this entire situation started with the storm.
-That might have changed everything. -Changed, how?
What do you mean that you changed everything?
Vera!
Maybe I saved that boy.
I have to know if he died or is alive. Why?
To get my daughter back.
Vera!
Vera!
Vera, open the door, please.
Hello?
Ángel, don't worry. Everything's under control.
Do you want to try? Let's go!
NICO LASARTE - MURDERED - 1989
NICO LASARTE IS A CHARACTER CREATED BY KAREN SARDON
I've got you, bitch. -Relax. -Stop.
Stop. You broke in.
-No. -Stop. What are you doing in my house?
Mine.
What?
-My house. -What did you say?
And it was a boy's house, too. Nico Lasarte.
I don't know what this is about. I just want to know if he's OK, where he is.
-What? -There was a... an old TV and a camera.
There was a connection with the storm.
Everything changed.
-Honey? -Love! Come up!
-Are you OK? -I'm in the attic.
-What happened the door? -They broke in, come up!
Love... I can't believe it, you?
Do you know her? She came to my office today.
She came to my office today. -What? -Call the police,
tell them she's an intruder.
David. -David, I need your help. -Stop. Don't move.
Hello, I called a while ago because someone broke in. Ursula Abad.
Stop.
She came back in... David, listen to me.
-Are they coming? -Yes, now.
David, please.
Stop using my name like you know me.
We know each other.
The police told me she was the one who removed the meningioma.
-Are you a neurosurgeon? -No.
-Are you a neurosurgeon? -No. I left neurosurgery when Gloria was born.
You wanted to study a master
to show your father you could be better than him.
You didn't ask me to, but I supported you.
Who is Gloria?
Gloria is our daughter.
What?
I swear I don't know what she's talking about.
I swear, she's lying.
-Who the fuck do you think you are? -No, no!
Leave me!
Where is she, David? -I don't know. -David!
-I don't know. -David!
I don't know!
What is it?
The whole street lost power.
What is the police doing here?
I don't know.
Inspector Leira.
-Hello. -Good evening.
Is something wrong?
No, we're looking for this woman.
Have you seen her?
-No. -No.
Is she OK? Has she done something? She's just disoriented.
Sorry.
Good night.
What is it, Mum?
A crazy woman broke into David and Ursula's house
and we think she hid at home.
Don't worry, we're fine.
I'll check on them and go to work.
Haven't they cancelled the flights because of the storm?
I've flown in worse, Mum.
Tell uncle Roman to come tomorrow. It's Angel's birthday.
Sure.
We can confirm that the lock has been broken.
Are you OK?
Yes?
Angel, it's me.
Angel.
-Where are you calling from? -The booth by your house.
Alright, calm down.
Calm down.
Listen to me...
you don't understand... I realised...
you don't understand... I realised... my watch... in your house...
I don't hear you well, what? My watch.
-What? -I don't have my watch.
I left my watch, I can't find it.
-Your watch? -I don't have it.
It must be in your house, on the floor.
-You didn't take it? -No, I don't have it.
-You didn't take it? -No, I don't have it. -Look for it, it must be there. -OK, don't worry.
-Look for it, it must be there. -OK, don't worry.
If you left it here, it's here. OK?
If you left it here, it's here. OK? -Listen, do what I told you. -Yes, of course.
I have the passport.
We'll talk before you leave, OK?
OK. I'll be at the bar near the airport.
-I love you. -I love you, too. A lot.
Mum?
Aitor.
Sweetheart...
I have to go to Erejón for a while, to the new office.
Uncle Roman will take care of you.
I'll visit you as often as I can.
Fuck! Who the fuck are you?
Listen, I know what this car means to you.
What the fuck do you want?
You bought it from your uncle Roman while in flight school.
Who are you?
Your father was a military pilot, Armando, you hardly remember him.
He died during a practice manoeuver.
I don't know when the connection between you and I broke
to stop me from meeting David and for him to stay with Ursula.
Tell me how we supposedly met.
In 2001.
One day after the New York attacks.
We took the same train every morning.
I nearly always sat in the same place.
Sometimes, like that morning, you sat in front of me.
When we reached Valpineda station...
-Are you OK? Are you hurt? -No, no... I'm fine.
You stayed with me, we became friends and started to hang around.
One night we went to the cinema...
You met David and introduced me.
-I'm Ursula -Hi.
From the first time, I knew it would be him.
What film did we see?
We saw Castaway.
I know you can't stand seeing planes crash.
You made an exception, for me.
No, that's impossible.
You liked me a lot.
Did I?
I liked you and let you go.
It was love at first sight with David.
Right...
Well... that was a great story.
It's a pity it didn't happen, so... It happened.
Pleased to meet you.
You were on the train.
But you didn't sit in front of me.
For some reason you didn't sit in front of me.
You should get help.
I have to go.
Wait, wait.
What do you know about Nico Lasarte?
Your neighbour, you studied together.
What has Nico got to do with this?
With Hilda Weiss.
Angel's ex?
Angel killed her.
The boy saw it.
He was run over.
But I think I saved him, and that changed everything.
I don't understand any of this, OK?
But I know that Angel has been with my mother for 20 years.
He couldn't hurt a fly. Much less Hilda Weiss. She left him.
She didn't. She went with someone else after the wall fell.
It's not true.
That's what he made you think.
That man killed his wife.
It's my mother's husband, for God's sake!
-Tell me about Nico Lasarte. -Enough!
I have to go.
Here. -You OK, nephew? -I'll tell you later.
-You OK, nephew? -I'll tell you later.
Today's guest is Karen Sardon,
author of the novel Mirage, published 2 decades ago.
In the novel, she describes how two symmetrical electrical storms
occurred on November 9th, 1989, and today.
-Welcome, professor Sardon. -Thank you.
How could you know this would happen?
Can you see the future, or does reality exceed the fiction?
Well, like a magician doesn't reveal his tricks,
a writer shouldn't reveal their inspiration.
But to answer your question: No, obviously.
I can't see the future.
My book is based on a story I was told,
about a boy with schizophrenia,
his hallucinations were so real
that they inspired me to write the novel.
So this boy gave you the idea of the woman who spoke through the television.
of the woman who spoke through the television.
Not exactly him. His mother.
There is a lot of coincidence in the story.
You left this at the hospital.
What are you doing here?
You were at David Ortiz's house.
He told me he knows Aitor Medina.
He's a pilot, so I presumed you'd be here.
TO NICO LASARTE
Karen Sardon found this story through Nico Lasarte.
His mother told her about him.
But the hallucination was real.
It was me.
Please, let me prove that I'm not crazy.
In fact, the mathematically interesting Hilbert spaces
are vector spaces of infinite dimension.
The type of Hilbert space necessary in each case
depends on the system of...
On nothing because class is over.
For questions, you know where I am.
For next week, read the theory of the cosmic web, by Richard Gott.
Maria Lasarte came to see me because her son was convinced his life was saved
her son was convinced his life was saved by a woman from the future
who appeared on his television.
What the woman wanted to know
was whether the electrical storm could have created a time-space warp,
something like a video call in symmetrical parallel time.
What happened to the boy? I don't know, she didn't tell me.
I don't know, she didn't tell me.
I was only interested in all the questions that I could use in my book.
Right, of course.
You were only interested in your book.
No.
I sent him to a specialist.
If you didn't have contact with him even then,
-could you find him now? -No, I couldn't.
Your book is pure fabrication, right?
Yes, pure fantasy.
But it's happening.
The storm.
I'm here. I remember Nico Lasarte.
That doesn't prove that the woman from the future wasn't just
in María Lasarte's son's mind.
Or that Nico Lasarte ever existed.
He might have existed only in the mother's mind.
Like this book.
It could be based just on my imagination.
But I exist.
I exist.
I told you my story.
And these photos exist,
they're proof of this.
Nothing proves anything.
We are the ones who make sense of it.
All we know is that the brain truly believes
the experiences that we feel.
It's function is to interpret a hallucination as if it were real.
What do you think would happen if reality were just an illusion?
So, given that under the same meteorological conditions,
the connection would be possible, -how could we recover it? -Why do you want to?
-how could we recover it? -Why do you want to?
Why?
To get my life and my family back. That's why.
I don't know, but if it's possible,
we would have to reproduce the exact conditions
that occurred at the time of the first change.
In the same place, with the same electrical connection.
Can I see your watch?
The original television, the camera and of course, during the storm.
What if, even with all of these elements,
What if, even with all of these elements, the storm ends?
The bridge would close forever.
The storm started 53 hours ago.
If it's symmetrical to 1989, it'll last 72.
This is the time I have left to find my daughter.
Will you help me?
How?
I need the old television and the camera.
The Lasarte could have them.
Searching police files can be very slow.
I need judicial authorisation, and I won't get it with this story.
-I need more. -Like what?
Something convincing.
Here it says he owned an abattoir and was going to bury his wife underneath it.
and was going to bury his wife underneath it. Who confesses something he was going to do
but didn't because he was arrested first?
"VALPINEDA MURDERER" TO BURY WIFE AT ABATTOIR
I think I've got it.
Coffee?
There's something I don't understand.
You still don't believe me, right?
Look.
This is your past life.
This is 1989 and this is now.
If what you say is true,
if there's really a gate with the past that allowed you to alter it,
why are your memories still tied to a time that really no longer took place?
Aren't you curious to know what your life is like now?
But this is real.
The body is real.
It is also real that you and I are here because you have another life.
A very real other life.
This one. With people I'm sure care about you.
I found the body.
Now it's fair for you to help me.
Inspector,
the judge wants to talk to you.
I'll be right back.
This body changes everything.
The judge's priority is to identify it, to be sure it is who you say it is.
Meanwhile, you are as suspicious as the owner of the land.
You don't have children, right?
Someone who doesn't have children has time to do what they want.
To be the best,
but they also miss things.
You asked for something convincing.
Something real and I gave it to you. What else?
Stay here.
All units, I've lost Vera Roy.
I repeat, I have lost Vera Roy.
Report to me directly if she is found.
My colleagues will back me up before the judge.
When you leave, you're on your own.
I've made some calls and revised credit cards.
This is all I can offer you.
BELMONTE HOTEL ROOM 1016
You found Nico Lasarte?
I think this will bring you to him.
Go before I change my mind.
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday, dear Angel,
happy birthday to you!
-Oh... -Blow harder!
Well...
David, where are you?
Something is happening.
Something related with that woman... -The body appeared... -I know, I'm watching it.
-The body appeared... -I know, I'm watching it.
No, Aitor flew to Dubrovnik, he'll spend the night there.
...the neurosurgeon Vera Roy informed...
...the neurosurgeon Vera Roy informed... No, this is crazy.
...and then disappeared.
I'm at the office. I'll be there in five minutes.
-No further information... -See you soon.
...on the victim's identity, but unofficial sources ensure
...on the victim's identity, but unofficial sources ensure that it could be the former wife...
Who was it?
It was Ursula, I have to go.
What is it?
It's not her, the family of a friend, something happened.
I have to go...
Dinner.
Don't escape.
Dr. Roy?
Monica?
What are you doing here?
They gave me this address
and this room number.
Can I come in? I'm not alone.
I understand.
Look...
How can I help?
I'm looking for someone called Nico Lasarte.
Do you know him?
No.
He's not here?
No, I don't know that name.
So who are you with?
That's my business.
Look, Dr. Roy.
I don't know what's going on, but we should call Dr. Fell.
Where are you going?
Dr. Roy, stop!
I don't know who you're looking for,
I don't know who you're looking for, but I swear he's not here.
David, I'm sorry.
-I'll call the police. -You're not calling anyone.
Right?
How long have you been together?
We're not together. I'm not talking to you.
Since my operation.
It's not what you think, I love her.
But you're with Ursula.
That's totally different.
Tell me what you want and let's get this over with.
Give me your hand.
Give it here.
I don't understand.
If I only know you from the operation, why don't I remember?
If I only know you from the operation, why don't I remember? What does it matter?
But I remember an entire life with you.
And I remember every day I was pregnant with Gloria.
I know why I'm here.
You'll bring me to Nico Lasarte.
-I'll bring you to the police. -Don't be a fool.
You work in a bank. You have access to customers data.
That is confidential.
This is confidential too, I suppose.
Good evening.
-Good evening. -Good evening.
Do you remember me?
Because I really remember you.
Yes?
Inspector Dimas is here.
Thank you.
Let's start at the beginning.
According to a police report from 1989, on November 11th a boy,
your neighbour, Nico Lasarte, accused you of killing your wife.
Good evening.
Nobody believed him. It was your word against his,
and you could prove your version.
But what was a child's fantasy is today a reality.
The events are from two days before, the ninth.
The day the Wall fell and the world changed.
According to your statement,
that day your ex wife, Hilda Weiss,
said she was going to visit a friend in San Narciso.
...the chance for Germans from the East...
According to the report, you declared that your wife was preparing
According to the report, you declared that your wife was preparing to return to Berlin.
to return to Berlin.
But I believe you lied.
She never wanted to go back to Germany.
And you accepted when she wanted to go visiting.
You felt the decision was going to create the occasion.
Something like that.
Mum.
Coming.
Excuse me. You have a call.
Hello.
Honey, the road to San Narciso is closed for the storm.
I have to spend the night here.
OK, don't worry.
-See you tomorrow. -Goodbye.
Yes.
She's not back until tomorrow.
Clara,
I promise to talk to her.
Things will change, OK?
Angel...
I love you.
I love you, too.
Mr. Prieto.
Tell me what happened that night.
Did you kill your wife?
What?
My love!
You scratched me...
Ángel.
Son of a bitch.
Hilda please!
Hilda!
Hilda!
Clara, no!
Stop it, Hilda!
Hilda! No...
Did you kill your wife?
Yes or no?
Answer, please.
I want to speak to my lawyer.
I have the right to remain silent.
This is the watch Nico Lasarte found in your house.
The proof you had an accomplice.
Nico Lasarte highlighted a detail about the watch.
The details are important, Mr. Prieto.
He noticed a small engraving.
"CM."
Can I see your watch?
What?
Your watch, please.
Thank you.
These are your current wife's initials.
Clara Medina.
The facts speak for themselves.
Only she could act as Hilda, to make her disappear.
And I suspect that you helped.
Will it work?
The guy who makes them is good.
Do what I said, and don't make contact.
These are assumptions, there's no proof.
Nico Lasarte had the watch implicating your neighbour,
Clara Medina, and you knew.
So you found a way to get it back at the boy's expense.
We'll talk before you leave.
OK.
I love you. I love you, too. A lot.
I love you, too. A lot.
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
I have proof.
Are you sure about it?
We have checked everything you've said.
But we have a problem, kid.
Your neighbour, Mr. Prieto,
reported that someone broke in and stole a gold watch.
He also says his wife left.
She left him for an ex boyfriend in Germany, her home.
Nico made a mistake.
But he would never make up something he says
he saw in Mr. Prieto's house to cover himself.
The problem is that his wife's bank account
shows movement in Berlin
and we checked the list of passengers, she flied there.
There must be an explanation. If my son...
Your son, Ms. Lasarte, has told an incredible story.
About a woman from the future who speaks through a television.
That she gave him the information about Angel Prieto.
We have to find the way to solve this misunderstanding.
I can only think of one option.
Relax.
-Stop, Nico! Please! -I saw it!
-Hello. -Hi.
Is that my watch?
Give Mr. Prieto back his watch.
If you promise not to do this again,
this will be our secret.
We'll be at peace, OK?
They moved away after a while,
I didn't see him again.
His mind wasn't right.
That's the easy reading.
Nico Lasarte made the mistake of mixing what he knew
with a story about a woman from the future.
That's why nobody believed him.
We just need time for the forensics to prove that the body we found
for the forensics to prove that the body we found is your ex wife.
Nicolás Lasarte.
Then, Nico Lasarte, will have won the battle.
Over 20 years later,
but he'll have won.
He was our customer, so was his mother and you say he lived in my house.
Let's track his movements, find his address...
Here, this must be him. Nicolás Lasarte Leira.
The circle is closing, Mr. Prieto.
I'll tell you what happened to Nico Lasarte.
He got obsessed with proving he was right.
All he had to do
was to wait for the woman from the future to come back.
He calculated the hours left in the storm,
guessing that when it ended the gate would close.
That's what happened.
Something in the future had stopped any new communication.
He only had questions,
and his mother only wanted answers.
Tests proved that he wasn't consciously lying.
So the reason for his obsession had to be
a mental disorder.
His mother decided to get away,
with the hope that some day he would be cured.
But it was just the beginning of a long nightmare.
First the psychologists,
then psychiatrists.
Then admission to a centre until he surrendered to their ideas.
But not to himself.
He denied the existence of Vera Roy so they would stop.
But Nico Lasarte knew you were guilty.
And he never understood why the woman who saved him once
didn't come back to help him.
So Nico Lasarte never forgot Vera Roy.
The top floor.
His post has been sent here for 5 years.
Are we even?
At the time, he didn't know her name, but he had a clue.
So he followed it.
And he waited.
His future and past came together in that moment
and he was frightened.
Everything that had made him crazy to others,
was becoming a reality in front of his eyes.
He didn't know how to reach her,
what could he say?
How could she believe him when she hadn't experienced it yet?
He stopped looking for answers
and wished that she would never look for them, either.
The flight of a butterfly can be very cruel
if it occurs in a place and a time that allows for change.
I was waiting for you.
-Sorry. -Are you OK?
Yes. I'm fine.
Let me help.
My name is Nicolás Lasarte Leira, Mr. Prieto.
We live in a system that is chaotic,
and drastically alterable.
Nico asked me to come in case this happened.
To help you remember.
To remember what?
It's best if you discover it for yourself.
Where is she?
Go home, Mum.
I'm sorry.
I've been stuck for two days.
Since you came to the station and you didn't recognize me,
talking about that life you had when I was a boy.
It wasn't the life you had with me.
It wasn't possible that you lived it because I changed it.
By finding you.
But you had those memories.
And you had erased me.
I let Dr. Fell interpret what was happening in his way,
and I waited.
With the hope that you'd remember.
Remember us, Vera.
I just wanted to understand
my experiences as a boy and...
why you hadn't come back.
I couldn't know that when you were to meet Aitor, you'd meet me,
and everything would change.
I avoided you finding me,
because I didn't want things to change again.
Because I love you, and I don't want to lose you.
I have feared this moment for years.
I feared the day you would find our connection in our present.
I imagined it all.
All of the possibilities.
But not that you would forget me overnight.
That you would go back to a life you haven't lived.
Because I changed it.
Then the storm arrived.
I need the camera
and the television.
I don't remember any of this.
I dumped all of it.
No.
Someone broke into David's house.
You broke in.
It was you.
To test the connection. You wanted to know.
I would have too.
Hello?
Yes, I tried it.
But I realised it was a mistake and disconnected.
I couldn't risk a new connection altering my past
and everything I did to meet you.
But I let you find me.
To see who David Ortiz really is,
and to find me.
You have to go back to 1989 and grow up
without an obsession with me.
You have to forget me so that you never have to find me.
And you have to forget Angel Prieto, too.
If they find him in the past that would affect Clara,
that would affect Aitor, and I need to meet him,
like I would have if you hadn't stopped it
that's the only way to meet David and to get my daughter back.
What if it doesn't work out?
We can't control everything that might happen.
-I'll take the risk. -No.
Let me be your memory.
Please.
Please.
Stay with me.
Do you remember me now?
This is real.
This is real.
We have to go back to 1989.
No. No.
I can't.
No, I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
I saved you.
Now it's your turn.
Hello?
Hello, Nico.
Who are you?
Listen to me.
I'm you.
You're me.
Where's the woman from the future?
You have to help me.
Please.
What I'm going to tell you is very...
very important.
Mum.
-What's wrong? -Nothing.
Are you sad?
No, I'm very happy.
Hey...
This isn't a dream, right?
What, Mum?
I don't want you to move from here.
Vera, love, are you OK?
What is it, are you alright?
I had a nightmare.
Another one?
What do you mean, another?
Vera, you've been acting strange for a few days.
Where...?
Where are the camera
and the television that were in there?
There has never been a camera in there, or a television... Are you really alright?
Vera.
Where are you going?
What's going on?
Vera, you're frightening me.
Where did you get the matches?
Here we go again. From the hotel in Seville, don't you remember?
It really happened.
Angel is free.
He kept his promise.
Vera.
OK, received.
Would you like a coffee?
Thank you.
The inspector is here.
Got it.
Sir.
A woman found a body. She hasn't said anything,
just that it's the ex wife of the abattoir's owner.
But according to our reports, she lives in Berlin.
-Who is it? -Her.
I want to know how you found the body, and why you think it's Hilda Weiss.
I knew it would be you, Nico.
Do I know you?
But we've got wind gusts of 30 or 40 miles an hour.
Visibility is poor, so you motorists be careful out there.
[man in Portuguese over phone] How's it going?
[woman] Yeah, you know.
Is Dad there?
[man sighs] He's not going to talk to you.
Do you think it would make a difference if I…
-[man] Came home? -No.
No.
If I write to him.
[woman] I've been having bad dreams.
I just want to leave.
I was wrong, okay? I never…
I just want things to go back to how they were. Fuck…
[man] Listen, I have to go to work now.
[reporter in English] That arrest led investigators…
[man in Portuguese] You there?
Simona?
-[man sighs] Simo-- -[call disconnects]
Hello?
[in English] Hello?
[man in English] Everybody out.
[in Spanish] Let's go.
[in English] Come on, huh?
Come on.
[in Spanish] Let's go.
Keep moving. [in English] Let's go.
-[woman in Spanish] Take care. -You too.
[in English] If you want to stay any longer, I need your ID.
It's been two weeks now.
Yeah. Okay, you'll get it. [light chuckle]
[woman] Ambar, are you coming?
-We don't want to be late. -I'll be right there.
[man] Don't mind the mess. We just took over the place.
We're still fixing it up.
Your, uh, room's just over here. You have a good view from this floor.
Not that Cleveland's much to look at.
How you finding it?
-Uh, yeah, it's nice. -[keys jingling]
[scoffs] Not been here long, then.
How many others live here?
Uh, you're the second. Freja's the first. Her English ain't so good.
Where's she from?
Somewhere they don't speak English.
Uh, ladies only. No guests after 9:00.
No smoking, no pets.
Okay.
Radiator's off. Once it's on, one side is warm--
-[Ambar] Oh, sorry. -[man] Shoot. I got it, I got it.
[Ambar] Are you sure? I can just--
[sniffles] Don't worry. I'll replace that.
-So, where are you from? -Uh…
South of here.
How far south?
Not very far.
You got a job? Yes.
They pay cash?
Yeah.
-One month's rent upfront. -[chuckling] A month?
You want the room or not?
Key is in the drawer. Anything else, I'm upstairs, top floor.
Just holler.
[Ambar] Thanks.
[female voice in Spanish] Saved messages.
[woman in Spanish over phone] Hi, sweetheart. It's Mama. Sorry for calling so late. [inhales]
You know I can't sleep in these beds.
Thank you for today. I know you have plans,
but I need you to come in tomorrow.
-[distant crying] -Please come. -Your visits are the only thing-- -[phone beeps]
[in Spanish] Can you stay a little longer?
Of course.
-Oh, sorry! -[Freja gasps] Sorry.
Uh, Freja?
Sorry, I'm… I'm Ambar.
Red said it's just the two of us.
Red is full of shit.
-This needs to be double stitched. -Okay. I'm sorry, sir.
-This hem's no good either. -Yeah, I'm sorry.
-It won't happen again. -I need you to hurry up.
-You should be doing twice as many. -Yes.
-Pick up the pace. -Yes, sir, I'm sorry. Thank you.
[male reporter] He adds the raids go after employees,
but not the business owners also committing crimes by hiring…
[woman speaks quietly] Come on, we agreed!
[sighs] But why? Can I know why? Yes! Fine.
Yes! Fine.
Bye.
Well, how much is the ID?
-The price went up to 3,000. -Three?
-Come on, you said it was one! -[woman] I know, but…
-This guy's an asshole. I'm sorry. -Why?
Birthplace. If it's Ohio, it's still a thousand.
-No, it has to be Texas. -[woman] Why can't you come from Ohio?
-I can't. -Then it's gonna have to cost you more.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it. You'll think of something. Texans are resourceful people.
[man] Be nice when we go out there.
[woman] I'm trying to be nice, but I don't know who she is.
You hardly knew her mother!
as long as you are able to, you know, be nice. [woman] I'll do my best.
[woman] Carlos? Dinner.
-[in Spanish] Can I help? -No, it's okay.
I hope you like meatloaf. Yes. [chuckles] It smells delicious.
Thank you for inviting me.
[man] Of course. It's our pleasure to meet you.
Thank you.
You must be Carlos.
-[in English] What? -Oh, we don't--
Carlos isn't used to speaking Spanish.
I'm… I'm sorry.
Carlos, Ambar's mama was my cousin.
That makes Ambar your second cousin.
Are you all set for Friday? Yes.
Yes, thank you very much.
No promises, but I did put in a good word for you.
Don't forget to bring your ID. They were pretty big on that.
So, how do you like the city, Ambar?
I mean, it's nice.
-Just a little cold. [chuckles] -[man] It's freezing.
-I have to wear two pairs of socks here. -[chuckles]
[man] You know, you should get a proper coat. Sylvia, don't we have something we can give her?
Oh, no, no. That's okay. I can buy one. No, it's fine. I--
I have an old coat in my closet.
Well,
thank you.
So, Beto says you didn't go to college.
Well, I was going to, but then Mami got sick.
I'm gonna go to night school to study business management.
It's a great thing you did, staying by her side through her illness.
Well, she needed me.
Putting your life on hold all those years, not a lot of people would've done that.
-Are you listening, Carlos? -[all chuckle]
-[Red] Lose something? -[gasps]
[Ambar] Hey.
No. Uh, there was a sound.
[Red] Basement's private.
Sorry. Um, I-- I actually need to talk to you about something.
Look, it's late. I need to finish up, so let's talk tomorrow.
-[door slams shut] -Study's private too.
Well, I need to talk to you about my deposit. Why?
Well, I'm very sorry, but I need my deposit back.
Something has come up. You can have the money for last night and tonight.
You just moved in.
I know, Red. Please, I… I need that money. I already spent it.
-What? -[Red] Refurbishments, tools, materials.
It's done. Sorry.
[Ambar] Hey, are you okay?
Freja?
[reporter] Coming up next, we find out what really happened to the four hikers
that went missing in the Swedish wilderness.
[Mama in Spanish] You've always had such beautiful hair.
[Ambar] You'd brush it a hundred times before letting me leave the house.
And aren't you glad I did?
Yes.
[Mama] Are you sure you're happy to stay?
Of course.
You're too kind, Ambar.
What's that in the corner?
[man] You want what? Can I get paid for next week?
You know how many girls would kill for this job? -And you ask me for an advance? -But what if I do double shifts?
-And you ask me for an advance? -But what if I do double shifts? Every day you're getting slower!
-You're lucky you still have a job. -[bell rings] I'm sorry. I'll move faster.
I'm sorry. I'll move faster. [man] You just got here, and you keep saying that!
I know, but I promise. I'm sorry.
Why don't I put you on packing?
I'm not supposed to, but just for today.
And you come back tomorrow and prove to me you're good for this job.
-Okay. -Okay?
How about a thank you?
[female voice] Ambar.
[woman] Why do you need the ID so soon?
What's so important about Friday?
I have a job interview.
So take the damned ID which says you were born in Ohio.
You can just say Texas was a mistake on your application or something.
-I can't. -Why not?
-Well, it's complicated. -So explain!
[Ambar] My uncle.
I called him up and asked… asked for a job, and…
he said he couldn't help me because I wasn't a US citizen, and…
I lied and said that I was born--
In Texas!
Mami used to live in Texas, and… now I'm stuck.
I didn't want to come here like this. But Mami got sick,
and then she'd get better, and I could make plans.
But then things would get bad again, and I'd have to stay.
I was relieved when it was all over.
I could finally leave for a new start.
You know, people always told me I had an eye for fashion.
A gift for seeing who people would like to be.
We came here, and I thought I would open up a shop or maybe start a website.
Five years later,
and I'm still working the same shitty job. [laughs]
We are too kind.
Why else am I still living with several members of my family?
I should make them work for me.
I love them, but life would be so much easier without them.
Listen, this is clearly the drink talking,
but why don't I lend you the rest?
-What? -You're going to have a real job soon.
You can pay me back.
And then maybe lend me some money to do my own thing.
Oh my God. Kinsi, are you… are you serious?
Yes! I'm serious.
When can you get this done? [Kinsi] As soon as you get me the money.
What are you doing?
Get this to your guy and… and get me my papers.
You are sure?
Yes!
-[Ambar] Hello? -[woman gasps]
-[in Romanian] What are you doing? -[in English] Sorry.
-[in Romanian] What are you doing? -[in English] Sorry. -[in Romanian] Who's this? -[woman] I don't know. She scared me.
-[in Romanian] Who's this? -[woman] I don't know. She scared me.
[In English] Hi. I'm… I'm Ambar.
-Maria. -Petra.
-Maria. -Petra. -[Ambar] Are you guys staying here? -For now. Drink?
-[Ambar] Are you guys staying here? -For now. Drink?
Um… No, no, thank you. I've had plenty tonight.
If I have another one,
I don't think I'll make it into work tomorrow. [chuckles]
-[Petra] Huh. -[Ambar] What do you do for work?
Yeah, it's… it's tough out there.
Yeah. It's so much better in here.
Right. Right. At least the rent is cheap. [chuckles]
It's cheap because it's shit.
Sure. [chuckles]
[Petra] Cigarette?
Uh… Yeah, yeah.
Thank you.
[Red] Evening, ladies.
-You ready to go up? -[Petra] Mm-hmm.
[in Romanian] Let's go.
I thought you said this place was women only.
There was this other guy downstairs.
Oh, that's just Becker. He's my brother. It's just me and him, don't worry.
[in English] ...as performed within the ritual sacrifice.
You will then give her the elderly, women, children.
In return, you'll receive the blessings…
We don't know how it began or how it ended.
-[man 1] Good luck. -[man 2] Let's go.
[man 3] All right, let's move it.
-Come on. -[car horn honks]
Come on, come on.
[man 3] Come on, come on.
[Kinsi on voicemail] Hey, it's Kinsi. It sucks that you missed me,
but leave a message and I'll call you back soon. Bye!
-[Ambar] Have you seen Kinsi? -She quit this morning.
All I get is a text. Didn't even bother to call.
-Do you have her address? -I can't give you that.
-Come on. I need it. -Why?
-I… I just really need it. -It's against company policy.
Company policy? What company policy? It's just you!
You ain't worth the hassle.
-You're fired. -No, no. Hey, wait, wait--
Hey, Kinsi, it's Ambar.
Call me back.
[Kinsi on voicemail] Hey, it's Kinsi.
It sucks that you missed me, but leave a message and I'll call--
[woman, muffled] Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
[woman sobbing] Help!
[Ambar shuddering] Freja?
-[Ambar gasps] -Oh, shit!
-I'm so sorry. -[Red] What the fuck!
What's wrong?
Have you seen Freja?
Uh, she… she moved out.
What? When? A couple days back.
People come and go from here all the time.
I'm sorry. I need to-- [Red] I wanted to talk about your deposit.
With the new girls here, it's a little easier, so…
-I can get it back to you. -Okay, now?
No, I don't have cash on me right now. [chuckling]
Tomorrow.
[panting] Okay. Thanks. I'm sorry.
[Red] Hey, Beck, you okay?
[female voice in Spanish] Saved messages.
[Mama in Spanish] Hi, sweetheart. It's Mama.
Sorry for calling so late. [inhales]
-You know I can't sleep in these beds. -[fluttering]
Thank you for today. I know you have plans,
but I need you to come in tomorrow.
Please--
-Ambar. -[gasps]
[woman sobbing] No.
[softly] Please don't…
Please, Mary, no.
[Mary] I must prepare you,
or Arthur will hurt us both.
-Come here! -[Ambar and woman gasp]
[Mary] Stop!
-Come here. -[woman groans]
[Mary] Hurry up! Stop!
Hey!
You'll do what I say.
[sobbing] No, Mary. No.
Please, Mary.
Please, Mary.
Mary, please.
Don't listen to Arthur.
-Please, let me-- [screams] -[gasps]
-[Ambar in Spanish] Come on. -[line ringing]
Pick up the phone!
-[Beto on phone] Ambar? -Beto?
[Beto] It's the middle of the night. Are you all right?
Beto, can you pick me up? I'm at 1521 Recolte Avenue. Please.
Please, Beto. I can't stay here. Please--
We're out of town. We're looking at a college for Carlos, remember?
Listen, if you're in trouble, call the cops. No, I can't call the police.
-[Beto] Why not? -Because…
Because I wasn't born in Texas.
[Beto] What do you mean?
I came here after Mama died.
[Beto] Ambar…
I'm so sorry. I'll make it up to you, but I really need your help.
Can you wire me some money?
Please, I promise I'll pay you back.
[Beto] I'm sorry.
It's just… we'd never even met before.
Look, I'll come see you as soon as I can.
Just try and stay out of trouble until then.
Red?
Red?
Red, I need my--
[sighs] Where's Red?
He said he'd give me my deposit back.
-I'll send him down when he gets back. -No--
-I'll pay the rest tomorrow-- -Just get out of here, okay?
[softly] Come on.
[man] Hold up. Hey, where you going, darling?
[man over PA] This is the red line to Tower City.
Next stop, West Park.
Fuck!
[female reporter] The 444 team has been tracking
this major weather storm all day.
We are here tonight to let you know just how long the snow…
Thank you. Can I-- Sorry, can I actually have another one?
Did you bring my deposit? Hello to you too.
Sorry, hi. [Red] No, I was out.
It's back at the house.
You sounded like you were upset, so I came straight here.
Okay. Can you bring it?
You want me to drive all the way back across town,
pick up your money, and bring it here?
-I can't go back to the house. -Why?
I don't want to take you back there either.
Becker and I didn't see eye-to-eye on your refund.
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
[inhales deeply] Becker's a bit off,
but he took care of me growing up.
Our dad, I had a hard time with him.
Becker stuck up for me.
But he's sick now.
And the way I see it, he looked after me…
Now it's my turn.
You know what I mean?
Come on. Let's get your money.
The money's in your room.
What did I tell you girls about smoking in the lounge?
[Maria] We weren't.
Ambar, come have a drink. No, I'm not staying. Thank you.
[in Romanian] Come help me!
[in English] Red, where's the wine going?
[Red] Wherever. I'll be there in a minute.
[Red] You sure you don't want a drink?
Where's my money?
You sure? Where's my money, Red?
Suit yourself.
I know this house is kind of weird.
My dad used to dig up and collect all this strange stuff.
He was a real nutjob. Killed our mom.
-I want to leave now. -Come here, come on.
It'll warm you up.
Get out of my way.
[Red] I wish you hadn't called me.
-I was gonna help you. -Get out--
I hope you know that part was true.
If you hadn't left, I would've given you your money.
-You'd be out of here. -Red.
But Becker…
He needs you.
Fuck you.
Let me make this as easy as I can for you. You gotta drink--
-Beck, I got this. -Quiet.
-[Red] Beck, I got-- -Shut the fuck up.
-[in English] Let me teach you something. -[panting]
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.
Open
your mouth.
No.
Please don't try to leave.
He'll make it way worse.
[Petra] We come in, please?
-You're alone? -[Petra] Yes.
[softly] Come on.
-Becker? -Yes.
We should stay together.
-You want to fight him? -No. He'll kill us.
-He's different. We must leave. -Now?
No, he's downstairs, always by the basement door. We should wait.
But in day he sleeps.
You think they're keeping other women in the basement?
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
There's something wrong with this place.
What have you seen?
I keep dreaming about home.
My son is there.
But he's changed, something's different.
I like him like this.
I can't leave him.
So I hold him.
I hold him tight, do not let go.
And… And I see this box.
A stone box?
[Petra] Even when I'm awake, I see it.
-I've seen it too. -[Maria] No.
[Petra] I think the box is here.
Where?
Basement.
I want to go home.
[Petra] You hear it too?
Yeah.
All night, the same.
Women crying.
[in Romanian] They're dead.
Ambar.
[in Spanish] Stay a little longer.
[Petra whispers] Ambar.
-[Petra] Ambar. Wake up! -[Red] Come here.
-[Maria in English] No, Petra! -[Red] Get up!
-[Red] Beck! -No!
-[door closes] -[Becker] Go.
-[Red] Why do I have to-- -[Becker] Now!
[exhales] Hey, man. It's a little early to be coming around.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for somebody.
Her name is Ambar Cruz.
-Sorry, don't know her. -She's 5'7", brown hair, this long.
-She said that she was living here. -[Red] Still no.
-[Beto] I'm sorry. I know it's early, but… -[Ambar panting]
-Beto! -[Red] Like I said, I ain't seen her.
She's in trouble. Maybe she isn't using her real name.
If she's lying to you about that, maybe she's lying to you about where she's staying.
[Beto] Yeah, I just want to be sure, you know?
-[Ambar] Beto! -[Red] Hombre.
She ain't here. That's her coat.
-What the hell are you talking about? -[Ambar] Beto!
-That's her coat. My wife gave-- -Hombre, settle down!
-That's her coat. My wife gave-- -Hombre, settle down! -Don't hombre me-- -[glass shatters]
[in Spanish] Beto, help!
[grunts] Ambar!
-Ambar! -Beto, up here! Third floor!
Beto!
[Red] Becker!
[Ambar] Beto!
[Beto] Ambar!
[Red] Becker!
-[Beto in Spanish] Where are you? -[Ambar] Beto!
-Are you okay? -Yes.
Step back!
Beto, watch out, there's another guy!
-[Beto groans] -[Ambar in English] Stop! Stop!
Leave him alone!
[screams] Leave him alone!
[in Spanish] Son of a bitch!
Jesus, Beck. Look what you--
Prepare her.
Upstairs.
Now.
-[crying] No! No! -[Red] She's ready. Just calm down, man.
Her next.
That's too many in one go, Beck.
You don't--
What are you going to do to us?
Are you going to kill us?
-Of course you're going to kill us. -Quiet.
Why are you doing this? I'm trying to help my brother.
[Ambar] By doing this? He's sick.
You haven't seen him after, there's benefits. Believe me.
We moved back home because we couldn't afford Beck's medical bills.
He wasn't doing so good.
I wanted to convince the old man to let us stay for a while.
Then we saw what he'd done…
to those girls.
He made Mom help him, and then he killed her too.
Mary?
Yeah.
We did the world a favor, getting rid of our dad.
I wanted to leave right after, but Beck said we could fix the place up.
But just like Dad, he started spending more time with that damn box.
He thinks it chose him.
And then he started getting better.
Beck says he only needs
a few more hits, and then we can stop all this.
Hits of what?
How many, Red?
-How many women? -He's my fucking brother.
Okay.
You need to get out of here.
[Red] We're done.
[whispers] Red.
Hey.
Hey, look at me.
Come on, look at me.
Let's get out of here.
I'm sorry, chica.
Red.
-She's almost done. Just gotta-- -Her next.
Don't fight.
The last one fought.
Stop!
[gasps] No! No, no!
[crying] Red!
[screams] Red! Red!
No!
Help!
Get help.
Please!
Oh my God.
[crying] Stop. Stop!
What the fuck.
Stop! Help!
Stop!
[screams] Help!
Please, please. Please wait--
-[Becker] Quiet. -[coughs]
[crying] Oh my God.
No!
[screams] No, no, no, no, no! No! No! Stop!
Becker-- Becker, Becker. Becker, stop.
Oh my God.
Becker. Becker, hey.
Please. Please stop. Please stop.
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.
Becker. Hey.
Becker.
Please let me go.
Come on.
-[Becker chanting] -No!
Please, let me go.
[crying] Becker, Becker, please.
Please stop!
You should feel honored.
No. No, no, no. No…
Come on, come on.
-Ambar? -[Ambar] Beto?
-[in Spanish] Ambar, hold on. -Beto.
[in English] Come on.
-[Ambar in Spanish] Are you okay? -Yes, I am.
Let's go. Hurry.
[Beto] Help me!
Help me!
[Beto] Together!
One more!
One more!
[Ambar] Beto?
Beto. [panting]
[Mama] You've always had such beautiful hair.
You'd brush it a hundred times before letting me leave the house.
[Mama] And aren't you glad I did?
Yes.
[Mama] Can you stay a little longer?
Please stay.
[Mama] Stay with me.
I don't want you to go.
[Mama] I need you to stay with me.
[Mama] Can you stay a little longer?
Stay a little longer?
No.
I can't stay here.
[Mama crying] I need you.
-Please, Mom, I have to go. -You're too kind.
-You're too kind. -No.
-[Mama] You need to stay, sweetheart. -No.
-Stay a little longer. -No.
-I can't do this again. -Stay still.
No.
[Mama] Stay still.
[Ambar] No.
[Becker in English] Quiet.
What is it?
-Go check. -Why?
[Becker] Something's different.
Open it.
-Why? What is it? -Just open it.
There's nothing.
Fuck!
[Ambar] No, wait!
-[Becker] Come on. -[screams]
[Ambar] Stop! Stop!
[in Spanish] Motherfucker.
Please. I didn't mean to.
Please don't do this.
-Mm-hm. -And a salad, I think.
[manager] Of course.
-[manager] Hello. Welcome. -Huh?
Have you a reservation, sir? [chuckles]
Uh! Um, Gra... Grace, under... -[Grace grunts, sighs] -[Chuck groans]
Right on time. [chuckles]
-[manager] Uh-huh. -He's not here yet?
I have a reservation under Grace.
Uh, really nice to meet you.
Ah, and it's nice to meet you. [chuckles]
[Grace] Declared missing from a shipwrecked ocean liner,
only to return alive after five-and-a-half years on a desert island.
Ever since I first read your story, I've been dying to turn it into a book.
Thanks for being here.
You're way more handsome in real life than in your pictures.
-[Grace] You haven't had lunch yet, right? -Uh...
Um, not yet. That's good. I ordered ahead for us.
[Chuck] Oh. Uh, thank you.
Let's just cover the basics while we're waiting for our lunch to come.
Is it all right if I record?
[Chuck] Yeah, it's okay.
-[recorder clicks] -Right.
How have you been since your return?
Busy, I guess. Adjusting to city life again has been a little rough.
Has it, now?
Oh! Are there strange habits that you can't break from your life in the wild,
like capturing and eating pets, or running around town with only a spear and a loincloth?
[gasps] Uh, no. Not like that at all.
It's just it hasn't been easy being around this many people.
[gasps, sighs] Yes, of course.
Well, I really appreciate you doing this interview.
I had heard you were turning down everybody that asked for one.
Well, I've been rather torn about that.
I've been worried that no one would believe what I've been through, not all of it.
But there are some remarkable little creatures that the world should hear about.
"Remarkable creatures"?
But weren't you stranded on the island all alone?
I was alone, and yet I wasn't.
I discovered some special friends.
What kind of special friends?
Sounds pretty mysterious.
-[Chuck] After the ship went down... -Hm?
I floated in a ducky tube until I spotted an island.
A desert island so small,
it took five steps to walk from one end of it to the other.
[Chuck] And after six long months alone on the island,
something happened.
Dude, it's rescue time! [laughs]
-[stomach rumbles] -So hungry.
Wow, is that fish? Ew!
Stop right there!
No!
Stop! [pants]
The bugs couldn't be real, though.
-[Chuck] Pretty hard to believe. -Huh?
I get that.
Truth is, I didn't believe it at first, either.
Being stranded on an island with weird little bugs like them.
Oh, could you describe again how the bugs looked?
Plus, did you name them?
Names, huh?
Yes, of course.
The red one who's always ticked off is Red.
And the stretched-out long one's name is Yellow.
-[Grace] Yellow. -And together, I called them...
-I called them Larva. -[Grace] Larva.
Uh, yes! There were two bugs, and he called them...
-[Chuck] Oh, hang on there. -Huh?
There weren't just two.
There was a third.
[Grace] A third bug?
[Chuck] Yeah. A primitive one living in the jungle.
Like a cave bug or bug Tarzan.
[Chuck] After that, they were always together.
-[Grace] They were always... -Red had the biggest crush on her.
Turns out bugs are just like little slimy people.
I see that you don't believe me either.
Hey, I really don't not believe you.
Unexplainable stuff happens all the time in this world.
[Grace] Just the fact that you were stranded and came back is an incredible story.
Yeah, well, guess that's true.
Um, then it was you and these three bugs
stuck on the island together the whole time?
Well, no. It wasn't just me and the bugs.
I miss you, Clara.
[sobbing] [Chuck] Clara.
[sobs] Clara! -[seal barks] -Huh?
[pants] Clara?
Clara?
-Clara? -[barks]
-Clara? -[barks]
You are not Clara!
"Clara"?
[Chuck] Clara?
-Clara! -[all gasp]
-Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Yes. -[both muttering]
Clara, now flip.
-[thumping] -Good. Good, girl.
-Now, dance. -[slapping]
[chuckles] That's right.
All right. Come on, Clara.
Clara?
[Chuck] Clara?
[Chuck] Clara?
-Clara. -[barks]
[in slow motion] Clara.
That's good, Clara.
[groans] Come, Clara!
-[both] Huh? -Right. That's it.
Clara!
-[Yellow farts] -Clara!
-[Yellow farts] -Clara!
-[Yellow farts] -[Chuck] Clara!
-[Yellow farts] -Clara!
-[Chuck] Let go of that flipper! -[barks]
-[Clara whines] -Clara, where are you going?
-[both gasp] -Clara.
-[Yellow farts] -Clara!
[grunts] This is completely your fault!
-Huh? You're humming? -[Red mumbles]
-[both laugh] -Clara!
-Stop it, you stinking bugs! -[yelling] Uh? Huh?
[Chuck] Clara.
Ah, Clara!
[giggles] Are you serious? A singing seal?
Yes. Whenever I heard Clara's song, I felt happy and warm.
[laughs] This is some tale.
Bugs that act like little people and a singing seal?
What comes next?
Does an alien visit the island in a UFO? -[laughs] -[Chuck] Speaking of...
-[laughs] -[Chuck] Speaking of... [gasps] What?
There was one there.
[Chuck] An actual alien.
Choice. All right! [snickers]
A little one.
Maybe I could just...
Are you kidding?
Ooh! Scary.
Ooh! I was a massive band geek.
-[low whirring, beeping] -What are you, now?
-[slaps] -Ha! Scary.
[Chuck] Hey, are you a... Crabsformer?
Oh! It's done!
[Chuck] Oh, yeah! -Rescue, rescue, rescue. -[whooshes]
Ow! Ah, that's hot! -Hot, hot, hot! -[flame crackles]
Hot! [groans]
[groans, gasps] My boat!
[chuckles] We didn't hit it off at first. But I guess I owe him, because he helped me build the boat that got me home.
Uh, yeah. -The Crabsformer. -[keyboard clacking]
[manager] Your lunch is served.
[manager] Mangia!
-Uh... -[Chuck] Oh, this is...
[stutters] It's crab.
Uh, I didn't think...
Hmm? Don't you want some?
-[Chuck] Mmm! -Ah, why not?
[slurps] It's really yummy.
I'm crazy for crab.
Great! I'm very happy to hear that.
Hey, wait!
What kinds of things did you eat on the island to survive?
It was hard.
I was hungry all the time.
-Huh? -Let me tell you something about fish.
They don't care if you caught them fair and square!
Uh, right.
[manager] And here's your coffee.
-Uh, thanks for that. -Uh...
Although, Larva helped expand my dinner menu.
-[mumbles] -[both gasp]
[panting] What's that smell?
[Chuck] The savory aroma of seaweed enfolded my entire body.
It was like waltzing with the waves.
And that ribbon of sweetness on top, is making all my senses do somersaults in sheer delight!
is making all my senses do somersaults in sheer delight!
Oh, my! That's great!
-Huh? It's... -[all gasp]
[Chuck] It's the island on a plate!
We're about to eat our entire island!
[Chuck] Oh, yes! So refreshed! [sniffs] Wow!
[Chuck] I am one with this fish.
Yes! Smack me with your life force!
But there's deeper flavor. True treasure!
Felt only in a humpback whale's bellybutton.
Yes! The fabled rainbow clam!
The entire island plate.
Dare I say, the entire earth is in my mouth, massaging my taste buds!
Porridge?
-[Chuck] For real? -[laughs]
Ooh, what's this? [gasps]
[Chuck] This tastes familiar already. [Chuck] This yearning...
I can't stop.
-This... -[clangs]
...tastes just like my mom's porridge.
[Chuck's mom] It's all right, my dear boy. [wailing] Mom!
Mom, can I please have one more bowl?
-[all grunting] -[Red squeals]
[retches] What, the bug's throw-up?
Sounds gross, but it was so good. -[Wendy laughing] -Uh... Huh?
Mister, your story's the funniest thing ever!
Tell us some more!
-[manager] Oh, Wendy. -Huh?
You know you're not supposed to bother the customers.
Sorry, I apologize.
-[manager] My daughter is very curious. -Hmm?
Uh, no, I'm fine with her hearing. -You? -Huh?
Mm, uh, all right, yeah! She's very welcome.
-[laughs] -[manager] Okay, but be quiet.
Right, I'll be quiet, Dad.
[Grace] Well, shall we get back to it?
Can you tell us about Larva in greater detail? Uh-huh.
Hmm. Well, uh... One minute, they're at each other's throats,
then, turn around, and they're risking their lives for each other.
Fishy, you're mine!
How long has it been since I've had fish?
Whoa! Ooh, no!
[grunts] I've had enough of you brats! Go away!
[grunting] Take that! [Chuck] You guys ruin everything!
What is this?
Hmm? What the...
[Chuck] Get off my sacred food!
Oh, you beauty!
You're gonna taste amazing!
Now, make a little fire. -[squeaks] -[humming]
-[Chuck] Yes! Burn, baby! -[hisses]
Burn! Burn! Yes!
-[thuds] -No! So close!
And yet so far!
But hey! -What's this? -[match rasps]
-Lucky me! -[flame crackles] Here we go! Here we go!
Mm. Lovely aroma.
-[Yellow grunting] -Hmm? What?
Why you...
[groans] Go away!
Stop it, all right?
I mean it!
Just let me grill my yummy fishy.
-That's how you want it? -[match snaps]
-[sizzles] -Hot!
Now, it's your turn!
Burn!
-All right, fish, where were we? -[thuds] -[puffs] -[screams]
-Seriously? -[screams]
Dinner is finally served. -[splashes] -[Chuck groaning]
Why are you doing this? Why? Why?
Well, we'll see who wins. [gasps]
[Chuck] Only one match left.
[Chuck] Stubborn little booger.
All right.
Draw.
-Ooh, look! What's that? -Huh?
Oh, that's so disgusting!
Huh? Where's my match?
Oh, please don't let it go out!
Curse that farting bug! [gasps]
[Chuck] Come on!
Hold on, flame, here I come!
Gas boom!
It worked!
It's burning! I win! I win! [laughs]
Beautiful fire! [laughs]
Happy fish party!
-[splashes] -[Chuck] No. Come back! Come back!
[narrator] The life of a pollack fish.
After the narrow escape, the pollack's relief is short-lived
for there are countless dangers that lurk in the ocean.
However, in the fierce struggle for survival with its natural enemies,
the pollack has become stronger and smarter.
Our pollack turns out to be a female.
With spawning season upon her, many males begin their overtures.
The flashy movements of one male are eye-catching.
The female pollack is interested.
-So begins their pollack romance. -[smooching]
[narrator] First comes love.
And then, of course, comes...
a hundred thousand to a million little fishy miracles.
And when the time comes, they will leave their parents' embrace
to start a new journey in the vast world.
Like their parents, they must survive many hardships and seek out a partner,
so that they may fill the world with little miracles of their very own.
The life of a pollack fish.
Fin. The end.
-Wow! Awesome! -[chef] For real? Those bugs are like a phoenix or something.
Yes, they are. Those little boogers could survive any danger ever! Uh...
-Uh... -Chuck. Lots of people seem interested in this story of yours.
It's the first time that's happened.
-[Wendy] Mister! -Huh? Please! Please keep telling us your story!
This is the best story I've heard in my 84 years on Earth.
So true!
I'm dying to try some of that tasty bug cuisine. Mmm-mmm.
Your lunch is on me, if you agree to tell us some more.
-Uh... -[Grace] Chuck?
-Chuck! -[gasps]
Are you all right with them hearing the rest of the interview?
Uh... Mm-hm. You bet.
I'm really touched you all wanna hear what I went through.
Uh, um... Great! Good!
If I'm honest here, this is hard to swallow.
It sounds like a fantasy movie.
And you haven't heard the half of it.
I haven't even gotten to the crazy stuff.
Huh? Why is it so cloudy today?
Ah, who cares? I've still got the best boat.
And today, wait for it!
We add the umbrella sail!
Uh, wha... Why is this...
Did I ever tell you until college,
I was on the soccer team!
Ha! Rotten bugs!
-[wind whooshing] -Ha, breeze feels nice.
Oh, no! Ah!
It's all because of you, bugs!
-[thunder rumbles] -[Chuck] It's all because of you, bugs!
Ah, this ends right now, you hear? No, you don't!
You're done living up to your name.
[Chuck] Uh... Oh, my head.
What happened again?
Oh, right, lightning.
Those annoying bugs.
[groans] Little monsters.
I can't wait to turn them into puddles of goo on the beach.
What the... Who's that? This is not happening!
-[Chuck] A bug! A bug is me! -[farts]
What have you done to me, you horrible nightmare? -[thwacking] -[both grunting]
-Food! -[Yellow mumbles]
Oh! Finally! [pants]
Uh? So big!
Stay back! Nice chicken.
-[Chuck] Huh? You now? -[metal clanks]
Sorry, I pushed you so darn hard.
-[robotic muttering] -[Chuck] Please don't hurt me!
Ah! Somebody help!
I'm trapped in a madhouse!
I'm a gross and revolting ugly bug.
Chicken tried to eat me whole.
That even worse...
I just thought of them as dumb little awful bugs.
-[ship horn blares] -Huh? What? Sounds like... Oh, my!
Ah! I'm here! Please help!
Huh? What the...
Oh, bug, right.
[Chuck] Just like the last storm.
[Chuck] Really?
All right!
[Chuck] Look. Yum, yum, yum! You know you want it!
-[Chuck groans] -[slurping]
No, not yet!
[gasps] Huh? All right! [Chuck] Here it comes!
Not now! Let go of me!
Please! That boat was my ticket back home!
Of course, it was only a dream.
-[loud blaring] -Huh? Is that a ship?
Yo, over here!
There's someone here!
Why, you little rotten bugs! Think that's funny, do you?
[Chuck] I'm sorry for acting so mean.
Ow! That hurts!
Why, you rotten little bugs! [groans]
After that stuff, I was able to understand them better.
Uh! It was a force of habit.
-I'm sorry! -All right. There, there.
So you're telling us you shared a bond with your bug buddies?
Yeah. But not just my bug buddies.
With Clara, Booby, Crabsformer. Mudskippers as well.
We were trying to survive together, after all.
Oh! I'm sorry, little fly!
Ah, the thunder's so loud!
-[chef] Oh! -Wendy, it's all right. Daddy's here, darling.
Is it gonna storm?
Looks like we're in for some temperamental weather.
Weather.
The weather on the island was absolutely cuckoo.
Either burning hot or freezing cold.
[Chuck] Freak tornadoes would rip up out of nowhere.
[Chuck] Why have icebergs completely surrounded the island?
[Chuck] Save me!
-[flame crackles] -I'm not gonna be an icicle.
We have to burn everything we can.
No! The fire's going out!
There's nothing else to burn. [Chuck] What do we do?
[Chuck] Lighter. My lighter!
-There you are. -[lighter clicks]
We're saved, Clara! We're saved! -We thawed up! Yahoo! -[barks]
[groans] What is that stink?
[groans] Hungry.
You little devils!
-[thumps] -What the...
Uh? Wha... A fish?
Ooh! I love you!
What's happening?
-[barking] -Cla... Clara?
Clara, why are you flying?
What the... Typhoon!
Save me, please!
Ah, cave door's blocked!
Oh, quick! Quick!
[grunts] Come on! [Chuck] Please.
Ugh, my butt!
-[all gasp] -The rock is coming loose.
Can't keep holding on!
You guys...
Uh, has it passed?
I guess it hasn't passed!
Clara!
Awesome.
-[whale hums] -Uh, a whale?
-[crackles] -Watch out!
[Chuck] Is that the... eye of the storm?
Are you kidding? The storm's eye is an actual eye?
-[Booby mutters] -Well, let's give it a poke.
This is pretty messed up right here.
We've got to put that big eye out!
Come on, you guys!
Ready? Fly!
Storms have real eyes?
-It's just so... freaky. -[manager] Mm-hm.
[Chuck] If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it myself.
But I promise it's true.
-But that's bizarre. -True that. Awesome sauce!
[Granny] Any of them wear glasses, you think?
[manager] Darnedest thing I ever heard.
Um, so, then, tell us how you got off the island.
-Yeah! -[gasps]
-Yeah. -Tell us how you escaped! Yes, do that!
-[Grace grunts] -Did a boat come along?
-Did you swim across the ocean? -Huh?
Get home.
That's what I was thinking the whole time I was there.
[Chuck] But I failed to escape so many times.
-I don't even know how many rafts I made. -Hmm.
-[Chuck] But, one day... -Uh?
...something happened that meant we had to leave the island.
Ah, this is so nice.
[spits] What the...
[Chuck] A volcano?
Everyone, get on the raft!
We need to leave now.
-[Chuck] Everybody here? -[robotic mutter]
[Chuck] Uh, what about the others?
[gasps] What are they doing?
[panting] [Chuck] You know, until 11th grade...
...I was on the baseball team!
We've got to escape.
[Chuck] Uh... Oh, no!
How can we ever get across that?
Lava everywhere!
[grunts] Right. Come on. [Chuck] It's live or die time.
I... I can do this.
Until the 12th grade...
...I was on the...
...the Pole Dancing team! Whoo!
It's over now.
I guess this is how I'm going to die.
You guys take care.
Hm. Enjoy my last performance.
I'm gonna die for acting nice.
I'm such a dumb, dumb, stupid--
-[thuds] -What's that?
Co... coconut? Uh!
Thank you, friends! All right!
Hot!
Made it!
This is the end of it all.
To ending this after all the suffering.
-[sobbing] -[liquid sloshing] I thought if I just got off the island, then I'd be fine.
God, are you gonna end me this way?
Rain! Oh, thank you!
Are you kidding?
Come on, paddle!
[coughs] Oh, thank you, dear friends.
Everyone, just hang on!
We'll be all right!
Save me! [gasps]
We're safe! Look!
-[thwacks] -What the...
-[slapping] -It stings!
Where did all the flying fish come from? -[zaps] -Huh?
Thank you for this meal!
[munches] So good!
Come on! It's party time!
[Chuck] Uh, that was good.
You know, thank goodness you guys are here.
Huh? Could it be?
Could it really be real?
Am I back?
I'm really back! -[tires screech] -Huh?
Then I said farewell to everyone and I was alone.
Uh, but still, you at least were able to return home safely.
[sighs] Yeah. But I lost the family I found there.
I wonder if they're all all right.
Mister, don't worry at all.
I'm sure your little bug friends are safe and happy somewhere. -[giggles] -Mm-hm.
-Just like you are. -[manager chuckles]
-[chef] They've gotta be. -[all chuckle] [manager] You said yourself they never die.
-[Wendy] They're strong. -[Granny] We're right, you know.
Yes, you are.
They're remarkably strong. And they keep on smiling, no matter what.
Yay, bugs! [giggles]
Go on.
Please tell us other adventures you had with Larva.
Ooh! Larva! Larva! Larva! [Wendy] Best story ever!
Yeah, all right.
I'll tell you about the time me and Larva went shark fishing. -[Wendy] Yay! -[gasps, chuckles]
We got stuck right in a big humpback whale's blowhole.
-[Chuck] Oh, the smell. -[all laughing]
Oh, it cleared up.
[manager] It's been great. Come back anytime.
-[Chuck] Thank you! -[Wendy] Bye, silly man.
-[Chuck] Oh, bye, Wendy! -[manager] Silly.
Well, that was certainly something else.
I guess it was.
-I don't remember having a nicer talk. -Uh...
Thanks very much for talking to me today.
Sure, not a problem.
I thank you.
I realized today it's not as important everyone believe me as I thought it was.
As long as I still remember my friends, I'll remember it's all true.
[Chuck] Whether people believe it all really happened,
well, that's up to them.
I finally truly feel like I've completely left the island behind.
Well, we're happy to have you back, Chuck.
Thanks very much, Grace.
I won't forget your help. Ever.
[Grace] To be honest, when I first heard his story,
I thought he was a big, lying liar pants.
Even now, I'm still not sure I believe all of it.
But I've written this book with the earnest hope
that everyone will hear of his amazing experiences,
and the special friends he made on the island.
And I hope people enjoy my writing too.
[Grace] Could it all be hooey in bunk?
Everyone who heard Chuck's brave, intense story,
-myself included... -[Wendy giggles] [Grace] ...felt almost transported to the island themselves.
It was clearly real to Chuck.
-And frankly... -Huh? -[groans] -...that's good enough for this writer.
[Grace] I hope it's real to all who read this book as well.
-[gasps] -[phone buzzes]
-[Chuck] Oh, Clara. -[coin clinks]
[Chuck] Oh, no, no. I just left.
-Yes. -[coin clinks]
-Hang on. -[muttering from distance]
Uh, yeah! I'm still here.
Sure. I'll be right there.
Fear is something that everyone experiences.
Fear is a feeling that we all know.
For me, a fear that shaped my life was...
God, that sucks.
"Recount a time when you faced a fear, challenge or failure.
How did it define you, or how did you overcome it?"
Hello?
Hello?
Tyler? What are you doing? Are you crazy? My mom is gonna hear you.
You see this mask? Got it on sale. Very scary.
Sorry. I was in the neighborhood. I texted you like 10 times. I told you my phone's off.
I texted you like 10 times. I told you my phone's off.
If I miss this deadline, I don't get into Columbia.
You'll be here with me the next four years.
Consider me your safety school. Close by, good parties...
Oh, really. Do you also offer a creative-writing program?
Oh, I'm super creative. Look, I got you a care package.
Pringles. And a little bit of Red Bull. Heh.
Thank you. You're welcome.
You are so busted.
So, so busted. I've got it.
Mom, this is not what it looks like. KATHY: No, I know what it is. I heard the entire thing.
KATHY: No, I know what it is. I heard the entire thing. Do people not whisper anymore?
"Hey, I brought Pringles and Red Bull."
"You better be quiet 'cause my mom will hear us."
Tyler, go home.
Okay. Uh, just to clarify,
do you mean back out the window or out the front?
Okay, I'll use the window.
Sorry, Sarah, I'll see you tomorrow. Ooh! I'm good.
Ooh! I'm good.
Ah! Still good!
Go to bed. Mom, I can explain.
We'll discuss this in the morning.
Sam is gonna love this. You go to bed too.
What'd I do? I don't need a wingman.
Okay. Going to bed. Hmph.
You need to stop electrocuting yourself and eat your breakfast. Mom, this is due tomorrow,
and eat your breakfast. Mom, this is due tomorrow, and it's worth 50 percent of my grade.
How about you eat 50 percent of your eggs?
Sonny, seriously?
Sorry. I'm getting close.
Coming.
Coming!
Morning, Ms. Quinn. Good morning, Sam. How you doing?
MAN: Kathy! Thank you for taking Sam.
We'll be back in three days. We owe you.
You definitely do.
Sonny! Grab your backpack.
Sarah, let's go! I've got an errand to run on the way to school. SARAH: Coming!
My condolences on your bust last night.
Good thing I'm here, in case any other dudes try to climb through your window.
Sonny. I'm gonna kill you.
Kill him in the car. Okay? Go, go, go.

Wow, you practically got a theme park here.
Check this out.
Oh, my-- Oh! Whoa!
[CHUCKLING] It's like being in the movies!
I'm gonna have these puppies up and running in no time.
You know, for the kids.

He doesn't actually have kids, does he? No, he does not. Ooh!
All right, everybody, let's make this quick.

Alrighty.
Right here? Really? Yes, here. Everywhere. It's called marketing.
Yes, here. Everywhere. It's called marketing.
Anything you wanna say to me?
Mom-- Mom, I was working all night. I swear.
I swear, Tyler just snuck over and--
I've just been so stuck on this essay...
You're a great writer. You always have been.
When you have to sum up your whole life in one essay, it all just sounds so...
unimpressive.
Honey. I think you're very impressive and very capable.
You do? Thank you.
I do.
Which is why I need you to watch Sonny and Sam this week while I'm working doubles.
Mom! No! My essay is due Friday.
Sonny's bigger than me. He doesn't need a babysitter.
Ha, ha. Have you seen what he blows up when he's supervised?
Hon, I know you're focused on getting out of here.
But if I don't cover these shifts at work, I could lose my job.
I need to know I can count on you.
Okay. Fine.
Really? Yes, really.
Well, you have earned yourself some corn cushions, little lady.
Really? Mom.
You're looking real nice today.
Thank you. Heh, heh. Blue is very in this year.
I see you got the memo. I guess we're in the know.
Okay. Hey, you know, the adult diapers are 2-for-1 if you wanna grab another.
I just need one today. Okay. All right.
I don't need them. They're for the nursing home
where I work. Of course.
I-- I don't-- Heh, heh. Hey, no judgment.
Um, okay. Heh, heh. I use a toilet. Heh, heh.
All right. Well, hopefully, I'll, uh, see you around soon.
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for checking me out.
Ringing up my purchases. You know. Yes. Yeah. Well, both.
Yeah. Heh. I'll just get my diapers and go. Yeah.
Happy Halloween!
Oh, dude, science fair sign-ups.
If I can just get my Tesla Tower to work, easily win. It'd be so cool.
What do you mean? You're already cool.
We are treasure hunters. People respect us around here.
Ew. TOMMY: Hey, Junk Bros. SAM: Spit wads? What are you, 9?
SAM: Spit wads? What are you, 9?
What'd you say?
[WHISPERING] Sam, what are you doing?
I got this.
You know,
we were gonna TP Principal Harrison's house tomorrow night.
But now, I think I'm just gonna spend the whole night chasing you guys around.
Hey. Boys, move it or you're tardy.
Of course, Ms. Hoover. I was just extolling to my good friends Sam and Sonny
my deep love for homework and all things learning.
Get to class.
Yeah.
What a jerk.
I'd like to check this book out, please.
And you are...? Tyler Mitchell.
Okay, Tyler Mitchell.
Oh. Yeah, you have four books you haven't returned since sophomore year.
And your account is frozen. Damn.
It's gonna cost 40 bucks to unfreeze it.
I just spent it on tickets for us to see DJ Bisky at the Den tonight.
You have to come. You can't say no.
My way of saying sorry for getting you busted.
I-I can't. My mom is making me watch my stupid brother all week and his friend--
Come on. Don't wait for college to start having fun.
Show starts at 8.
Get your brother a babysitter.
Okay. Sam, what do you think?
Nice. Looks just like you.
Hello.
Yeah. Yeah, you're speaking to a Junk Brother.
Yes, ma'am. This afternoon?
Let me check with my associate.
Hang up on her. This is our opportunity.
We're too busy. Stop it. We're doing this.
I have my Tesla Tower project, I have algebra. No way.
Fine, fine, fine! Whatever. Sam.
All right. Fine.
You are in luck. Yeah, we can squeeze you in.
24 Ashley Lane?
No, no problem. No problem.
Yeah. Fear not, ma'am. Junk is our middle name.
"Junk is our--"? Do you even hear yourself?
Get your shoes on. It's time to get rich!
I already have my shoes on.
I guess this is it. 24 Ashley Lane.
Twenty-four is the number of people murdered here.
All right, Sonny.
Let's do this.
Hey. I don't like the way those things are looking at us.
We're treasure hunters, Sonny, remember. Come on.
SONNY: Some treasure.
This place is definitely haunted.
Dude, there's more stuff over here. Come on.
This room's even worse.
Come on, Sonny, it's not that bad.
There is nothing to be afraid of.
SAM: Who stuffs a cat?
How much are they paying us for this?
Can't believe you said we'd work for free.
Not for free. The lady said we could keep any junk we don't throw away.
Some of that stuff can have monetary value.
You know what else has monetary value, Sam? Actual money. Just start cleaning. Come on.
Actual money. Just start cleaning. Come on.
Found some more stuff in the attic.
SAM: Okay, what do we got? Maybe this is worth something.
It's stuck.
Dude, I think we just found a treasure chest!
Go get it. Jackpot!
This is amazing. It's like a whole room in here.
I told you. We come here, we find treasure.
Help me with this. I bet this thing
is filled with gold and diamonds and Bitcoins.
Uh, you know Bitcoins are cryptocurrency, right?
It's not real coins, it's virtual coins.
It's really cool. It starts with a process called mining--
Stop being a nerd for a second and help.
Yeah, sorry. Thank you. Here.
Yeah, sorry. Thank you. Here. All right. You ready? Three, two, and--
What?
It's locked.
Who would lock a book?
Here's a key.
Oh, man.
SAM: Well, what's in it?
Nothing. It's just a beat-up old book.
Doesn't have a title page.
So much for treasure. Well, look.
So much for treasure. Well, look. We still have all this stuff. This is a good haul.
Just grab the book anyway. It's gotta be worth something. Yeah.
Sam. Sam, turn around.
SAM: Where did that come from?
"My name is Slappy. What's yours?"
Wait, I think it says something on the back.
SONNY: "Karru marri odonna loma molonu karrano."
He's so creepy.
It's kind of like he's alive.
I don't think anything's been alive in this house since that cat.
I mean, look at this place.
But I'm alive now! Aah!
Oh, Sonny, just give me a kiss. Just one smooch.
That's not funny. Yes, it is. It's hilarious.
It's a business. We're running a business. Take this more seriously.
It's too easy, Sonny. Come on, man. Hey, I'm taking him.
SONNY: Don't know why you took that thing.
What do you mean? He's awesome. Whatever.
TOMMY: Hey, it's the Junk Sisters!
Oh, great.
Well, at least we know our marketing's working.
No teacher around to save you now.
Hey, are you wearing my old sweater from my grandma's yard sale?
Leave us alone.
Okay. Give me back my sweater and I'll let you go.
Really? Unless you want your face punched.
[SIGHING] Whatever.
And your box.
Fine. Just take it.
Yo, what we got?
What's this? Let's see. Old radio.
BOY 1: Is that a ruler? BOY 2: That's a dog toy.
A stupid book.
Wow.
Great business you guys are running.
Heh. Your turn.
No. No, I'm not giving you my box.
Sam, just give it to him. I like my face unpunched.
No way. We worked for this stuff.
Hey, Tommy! TOMMY: Oh!
Look at that. Tommy, give him back! Want your doll? You dress him up when you get home?
Want your doll? You dress him up when you get home?
SAM: Tommy, this isn't funny.
What the--?
What is going on?
BOY 1: Tommy, pull up your pants! They're stuck.
Thank you very much. Sonny, we need to go!
Go! Go! Go! No, don't touch my underwear! God! Stop!
No! Go get them! No! Go get them!
Go! Okay, okay, okay!
Better pedal faster!
Oh, no.
Come on, don't make it easy for us!
We need to go!
We're gonna get you, man!
They're gaining on us!
Faster!
What just happened? I have no idea.
Get back here, you two!
Ah. Why does this keep happening?
Sarah! You won't believe what happened. You are never going to believe this.
We were in this crazy, abandoned, creepy house and found this fireplace, which had a cat on it I twisted.
and found this fireplace, which had a cat on it I twisted.
It went to a secret compartment that opened.
Then there was a treasure chest.
Okay, but long story short, we found...
this guy!
Th-this guy.
This...guy.
Wow. It's like you're actively trying not to be cool.
Here. Mom specifically said you should fold the laundry.
I'll be in my room if you need me, but do not need me.
Hey, Sarah?
This specifically says you are supposed to fold the laundry.
Sarah.
♪ I spend all the time Waiting at night for you ♪
What am I doing?
SONNY: We already banned jumping. SAM: I banned sucking, yet here you are. Now, come on.
Hey! Yes!
Yes!
It's 4 to 1. Why are you celebrating? Scoring is a reason for celebration.
SARAH: Bye, I'm leaving!
Where you going? Out. I'll be back by 10.
Where you going? Out. I'll be back by 10. If Mom calls, tell her I'm in the shower.
You were gonna help me with my science presentation.
There's two dummies on the couch. Practice on one of them.
Ouch.
Tyler!
SAM: All right, there we go.
Okay. And...
Sergeant, your orders are to guard this porch.
It was more than a hundred years ago
when Nikola Tesla first lit up the sky over Wardenclyffe, New York.
Tesla wanted to create a world where anything could be transmitted
where anything could be transmitted through giant electric towers:
Power, sound, maybe even brain waves.
It was like the original Wi-Fi.
But suddenly and mysteriously, he shut down his lab in 1908.
His tower never lit up the sky again.
Until... today!
May I have a volunteer?
You, sir, in the gray suit.
Hold this and prepare to be amazed.
I present to you all:
Tesla!
Don't give me that look. I'm trying to bring back your tower.
SLAPPY: Bravo.
I, for one, think it's an electrifying presentation.
Sam. I'm not gonna fall for that again.
Ha-ha-ha. Very funny.
It's like a microphone? You're talking through your cell phone or something?
Sam. Sam, it's a stupid prank.
You ever heard of personal space? Mm!
How are you talking to me right now?
You brought me to life. Don't you remember, Sonny?
Sam? SAM: What?
What's the problem?
Just come up here. Please.
Dude, I told you, I don't care about Tesla.
Right now, Sam. SAM: Fine!
I've always wanted a brother. Please don't try to educate me on Tesla.
Please don't try to educate me on Tesla.
Hello, Sam. Thank you for saving me from that moron today.
Oh, he's battery-operated.
[WHISPERING] No, no, no. Sam, Sam, he's alive.
SLAPPY: Sorry for what happened with Tommy.
I guess you could say he got hosed.
That was you? SLAPPY: Yep.
And now that we're family, we can be brothers!
I think I'd make a great Junk Brother.
Right. Just a sec. Sidebar.
Are we losing our minds?
I don't think we can at the same time.
Okay, but just to clarify, we're talking to a puppet right now.
Yeah.
Maybe he's alive.
Of course I'm alive! Heh-heh-heh.
And I can make all your problems go away.
Didn't your sister tell you to fold the laundry?
There. Now you have time to do your homework.
Oh, what's that? You don't want to do your homework?
That's okay. I just did it for you.
You know algebra?
A squared plus B squared equals of course! Heh, heh.
This is amazing. It's all correct.
So you can change all of our grades.
I can only change the things right in front of me.
But whatever I see, I can bring to life.
Karru marri odonna loma
molonu karrano.
ANNOUNCER: Round one. Fight!
SONNY: That is awesome.
I will never question picking up junk again.
Wait until Mom and Sarah find out.
SLAPPY: Slow your roll there, kid.
Let's just keep this our little secret for now.
Give me a chance to win them over first.
SLAPPY: Ah, you're terrible at this. Heh-heh-heh.
I'm literally crushing you right now.
Can't believe you're losing to a puppet.
Right. And I'm not even using my magical powers. Heh. Hm? [DOOR SLAMS]
Back so soon?
Don't ask. SONNY: Are you okay?
What happened? What happened?
Well, turns out the guy I liked is a total scumbag.
Mom expects me to run this entire house by myself.
And if I don't figure out this essay by Friday,
I'm never getting out of this town. So no, I'm not okay.
Why are you guys acting so weird?
Us? Nothing.
SAM: No reason at all. Mm-hm. I'm working on my science project.
We're just playing video games. Just us two.
Nobody else. SONNY: Mm-hm.
I'm going to bed.
Good night.
Who just said that?
Me! Sam.
[IN RASPY VOICE] Good night. SONNY: It's a new thing we're doing.
[IN RASPY VOICE] Good night. Good night.
Hit the hay. SONNY: Good night, Sarah.
Night-night.
[NORMALLY] That is not cool, Slappy.
What the hell?
Ugh. God, they are such tools. TYLER: Boo!
Missed you at the show last night.
Bet you did. You have fun?
It was okay. A bunch of us just hanging out.
Totally casual.
Right.
What's with the dummy? Oh, him?
We were just hanging out.
Totally casual.
Fly, little ghost.
Hey, whoever that is, can you toss me up some more string?
SLAPPY: Sure.
Okay.
That's hilarious.
Sarah?
Oh! Hey, hey, hey, not funny, not funny.
Sarah, stop fooling around.
I'd say you're the one fooling around.
How are you talking?
I love the theater.
I always bring down the house.
Wait, no! What are you doing? What are you doing?
Tell me, Tyler. What does it say on that top step?
Uh... It's not a step?
Maybe you'll remember that
the next time you step out of line with my sister.
It was a puppet, man. It was a puppet.
It had these supernatural powers.
He could move things with his mind.
I swear.
She knows! Ask her. It was in her locker.
Please tell him real quick. Sarah, tell him!
It's just the meds kicking in, sir.
Last guy said he saw a dragon.
It wasn't a dragon. It was a puppet.
Nikola Tesla constructed this tower right here in Wardenclyffe, New York
to beam bolts of electricity across the world.
And today...
we are going to beam bolts of electricity across this classroom.
Someone beam me out of this classroom.
May I have a volunteer?
You, ma'am, in the pink sweater.
Hold that and prepare to be amazed.
Behold:
The power of Tesla.
Mr. Quinn, unplug that now!
BOY: That was awesome!
And that was my presentation on Nikola Tesla.
Any...? Any questions?
Today's picture day!
This is not good. I'm so busted.
Oh, great, the fire department's here?
They're definitely gonna make you repeat a grade.
Please tell me you guys had nothing to do with this.
Sonny blew up the science wing. It was so cool.
It was an accident.
What are you doing here?
Tyler Mitchell just got loaded into an ambulance.
He said the dummy you guys put in my backpack
attacked him with supernatural powers.
We didn't put Slappy in your backpack.
Get in.
SARAH: You're telling me
that you discovered a walking, talking dummy and you didn't tell me?
He seemed like a nice guy at the start.
He had great manners. He told us to keep it a secret.
A, I'm your sister.
And B, as a general rule, when an animated doll tells you to keep secrets, that's a red flag.
He's not just some doll. He's got powers. He can move stuff with his mind.
You guys, this is insane.
I mean, why would he go after Tyler?
Maybe he heard you complaining about him last night.
Great. What else did I complain about?
Mom.
Hey, kids, you wanna see the mummies come to life?
Sorry, Mr. Chu! Don't have time to talk now!
Your loss!
Mom! Ms. Quinn!
Hey. You didn't tell me you got a ventriloquist dummy. How fun!
He was sitting at the table like a little person.
"Hi, kids. My name is Bobo. And I like listening to Mom." Heh, heh.
Mom, his name is Slappy, and I would not do that if I were you.
Slappy. That's a ridiculous name.
No, no. His name is Bobo.
Mom, you don't understand. Ms. Quinn, he's alive.
I think these guys are trying to play some sort of a Halloween prank on us,
but I'm not buying it. Are you? No.
Oh, let me get that. But nice try. Very creative.
Stay right there. Don't go anywhere.
Hi, kids. Good day at school?
Oh, my God. He sounds even creepier than he looks. Ha-ha-ha. We're gonna be such a happy family.
Ha-ha-ha. We're gonna be such a happy family.
You're not our family.
Do it, Sonny. Turn him off.
Hearing you say that makes me mad.
"Karru marri odonna loma molonu karrano."
Don't do that.
Do it again.
"Karru marri odonna loma molonu karrano."
It worked.
And trust me.
You don't want to find out what happens...
when I get mad.
KATHY: Okay. Hm?
Well, that was an interesting phone call.
Anything you wanna tell me?
Yes, we've been trying to. That dummy is evil.
You blew up the science lab?
Yeah, there was that too.
Do you know how much damage you've caused?
It wasn't Sonny's fault. KATHY: I'm sure it was an accident.
It wasn't an accident. The dummy did it. Yeah.
Do I look like a dummy to you?
We're telling the truth!
Here's some truth for you. Halloween is canceled for the three of you.
What? Canceled.
Come on. KATHY: You know...
Come on. KATHY: You know... I expect this kind of craziness from the boys.
But I felt like you were gonna help me keep things under control, Sarah.
Mom. I'm disappointed.
Come on. Mom. Mom, please.
Not as disappointed as I am.
My room. Now.
We've got a problem.
Yeah. I have never seen your mom that mad.
I'm talking about the psycho dummy on our couch.
Did somebody call a family meeting without me?
No, no. Slappy, why would you think that?
We were just planning a surprise party for you.
Well, I've got a surprise for the three of you.
This is my house now.
And under my roof,
I make the rules.
Sorry, but you just got voted out of this family. Huh? Aah! SAM: Oh!
What do we do with him now?
Fireplace.
No. No way. I would have nightmares the rest of my life.
No. I have a better idea.
SONNY: Ugh. We've been walking forever.
It's like this whole place is made of poison ivy.
SAM: Stop complaining.
How much farther is it?
Here. This should work.
Am I the only one that feels like we're committing a crime?
It's a dummy. The only crime we're committing is littering.
Ready? Yeah, yeah.
Okay, watch out.
It's done.
Let's get out of here.
SAM: Sonny, come on.
We just killed a puppet.
Trust me, we had to.
And I say we just forget it ever happened, because no one will believe us anyway.
It's over.
He's locked in a suitcase.
There's no way that dummy's getting out.
Who you calling "dummy," dummy?
What do you want from us?
I just want to be part of the family.
SONNY: He's gonna break through the windshield.
Is everyone okay? SAM: Yeah. Think so.
Where's Slappy?
Guys, I think we just made things a thousand times worse.

Yeah, but Tommy Madigan took it from us.

Wait a second.

I love a good holiday sale.
Hello, old friends.
If those kids don't want me to be a part of their family,
I'll raise one of my own.
Karru marri
odonna loma molonu karrano.
Karru marri...
Okay.
Yes.
SLAPPY: Trick or treat.
Welcome to the family,
Walter.
Serving families is what I do. Heh, heh.
Heh, heh. Come along, then, brother.
Just wait until you see what I have planned next for this town.
Guys, this is bad.
This is really, really bad.
You know what we need to do? We need to call the police.
And tell them what? That an evil dummy is about to bring Halloween to life?
Yes! SARAH: Great idea, Sam. They'll come and arrest us.
Wait, guys, I found a number. For Stine?
No, says here nobody knows where he is, but this is for Richard Shivers.
He's the president of the R.L. Stine Appreciation Society.
What are you doing? I'm calling.
RECORDING: Good day, you've reached Dr. Richard Shivers
RECORDING: Good day, you've reached Dr. Richard Shivers and the R.L. Stine Appreciation Society.
If you're trying to reach Stine, don't bother. Otherwise, leave a message.
SARAH: Hi, Mr. Shivers, my name is Sarah Quinn. I live in Wardenclyffe, New York.
I desperately need to get in touch with R.L. Stine.
This is gonna sound crazy,
but I think one of his stories has come to life.
Hi, Mr. Shivers...
Well...
Looks like we're on our own.
Wait, where are we going? To find Tommy Madigan and get that book.
Get that one.
No way he's gonna be able to get that. Oh.
SONNY: Tommy! Tommy! SAM: Tommy! Hey.
Tommy! Tommy!
BOY: What do these idiots want? I'll take care of this.
SONNY: We need that book.
It's really important. It's super important.
The book with the lock on it. Okay, okay. What book?
The one you stole from us, Tommy.
Oh, yeah. I've got it right here. Oh, really? No, idiot.
Oh, really? No, idiot. Why would I be carrying a book around with me on Halloween?
Now, go back home with your babysitter. I'll be there in a bit to egg your house.
Listen, you little punk, I'm not the babysitter. I'm Sonny's sister.
You're gonna give us that book back or I'll make your life a living hell.
The only thing you'll use that toilet paper for is to wipe--
Okay. God, you don't have to be so mean about it.
Let's get out of here.
Book's at my house in my room.
But it's hidden, so good luck finding it, losers. Heh, heh.
Those are some awesome costumes.
Is this actually happening?
Guys, we gotta find that book!
SLAPPY: Evening, Mr. Tesla.
You don't mind if we bring your tower back to life, do you?
[QUIETLY] What did he say?
Shut up.
SLAPPY: Tesla used this tower to project electricity,
but I'm going to use this tower to project my magic in ways he never imagined.
to project my magic in ways he never imagined.
It takes a genius to know a genius.
Come along, Walter.
We've got work to do.
Very well. Let's go.
SONNY: This is Tommy's house.
Well, I guess we just knock?
SAM: Knock loud. He lives with his grandma.
Okay.
Wait! Guys, there she is.
SONNY: She's asleep.
I guess we'll just have to wake her up.
Hello! Come on. Hello!
Hello! Tommy's grandma!
[SIGHS] Wow. Guess she's a deep sleeper.
[SIGHS] It's locked.
Find another way in and go get that book.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna make sure nothing surprises us. Go!
What?
[WHISPERING] I can't believe we're breaking into someone's house right now.
[WHISPERING] Hey, they got gummy bears.
Who cares? Stop screwing around.
AUTOMATED VOICE: Hands off!
Sam, stop screwing around. Let's go. Okay, all right. [CLICKS]
SLAPPY: Watch this, Walter.
Why settle for a small family, Walter,
when we can project my power everywhere
and bring all of Halloween to life? [LAUGHS] Yeah.
[LAUGHS] Yeah.
Karru marri odonna loma
molonu karrano. Whoa.
Karru marri
odonna loma molonu karrano.
Sam, I found it. Yeah. You found it?
SONNY: "R.L. Stine."
How did we miss that?
That can't be good. Yeah. We gotta go.
Let's just go back out the window. SAM: All right.
Sam!
The hand has my hand!
Just rip it off! Throw it!
Sam. Turn around.
They're moving.
Sonny, they're just gummy bears. They're so tiny and cute. What can they do?
Hey there, little guys.
Sam, you just ate half their family. I would not do that if I were you.
Why are they walking towards us?
Okay. All right. Maybe they just want us to stay and play.
God, where is everyone?
Oh, there's one on my back, Sam! Okay, okay!
Pull harder! I'm trying!
Go for the window, Sam!
I'm coming!
Just! Stop! Giggling!
Sam! I need some help over here...
[WAILING] Sonny!
Mom, we're under attack!
Sonny, what are you talking about? Where's Sarah? Who's attacking you?
Gummy bears.
KATHY: What? Honey, you're mumbling. Put Sarah on the phone.
KATHY: Sonny. BEAR: Whee!
KATHY: What--?
Okay, that's it. Do not leave the house! I'm coming home.
Sonny, help!
Sam, I'm coming!
Hurry!
No, no, no! You'll never take me alive!
That is my new favorite book.
You okay? I think.
Let's get out of here.
What are you guys doing in there?
Oh, no big deal, really. Just being mauled by my favorite comfort food!
Wait. Just stop. Stop, stop! What are you guys even talking about?
Everything is alive, Sarah. Even candy.
Well, is that the book? Let's read it.
There's something you need to know about this book.
What?
Look out!
That's what.
This is not a normal book, Sarah.
Who would write this?
Oh, what is this?
Okay.
Hyah! Oh, you rehearsed that, did you?
Best costume of the night, sir.
GIRL: Go!
MAN: What's going on? There! Let's take the alley. It's empty.
Wait, wait!
We need to read the book and see how we can end this. Let me see.
"It was nearly Halloween in the town of Wardenclyffe--"
Blah, blah, blah. Here!
"His revenge was to create a family by bringing Halloween to life, but that wasn't enough."
by bringing Halloween to life, but that wasn't enough."
That seems like plenty of revenge to me.
"Because he wanted more than a family. He wanted a mother.
His plan was to..."
Was to what? Keep reading.
I-I-I can't.
That was the last page. It's an unfinished manuscript.
What?
Okay, great. What do we do now?
Slappy's gonna go after Mom.
That book is the only thing we have to stop him.
We have to go to the nursing home and save her.
Mom's not at the nursing home.
Where is she?
On her way home to save us. What?
She called while we were attacked by gummy bears.
Why answer at a time like that?
Maybe because unlike you, Sarah, I pick up Mom's phone calls.
Really? Guilt trip much?
We need to find your mom before Slappy does.
Now, come on, let's go!
Your woodworking skills are impressive.
Yes.
This will do nicely.
Oh, I used to manage a hardware store.
Walter. Focus, please. Yes.
Now tell my monsters to get me Mama and get me that book.
SARAH: Run! [PEOPLE CLAMORING]
SAM: Duck! [ALL SNARLING]
Look out!
What the--?
SONNY: That's Mr. Peters!
MAN 1: Nice doggy. MAN 2: It's right behind you!
MAN 1: Ah! Not on my leg! KATHY: Help!
That's Mom! That's Mom! Come on!
PIRATE: You bunch of scallywags!
KATHY: Kids, watch out!
Behind you!
Okay, now's our chance.
Give me the book. I'm gonna protect Mom.
You get the ladder and meet me at that tree.
Wait till it's safe, then go. Okay.
Okay, okay.
Oh, my God! We're all gonna die! Run for your life! Ah!
[CRYING] Oh, my God.
Oops. Not a monster.
SAM: All right, let's go!
Come on!
Halt!
My orders are to guard this porch!
No way.
You like carving pumpkins, huh? Look what you did to poor Terry.
Hiya! I'm round.
Sergeant Squash, open fire.
We need to find another way in! No. This is my house.
SERGEANT: I'm hit! Medic!
What are you doing? Put me down! Hiya! Happy Easter. No, no! TERRY: Ugh!
Yes! Let's go.
Sarah, I was so worried. Are you okay?
I'm fine. Just hang tight.
I'm gonna get you down. I promise. I just need you to trust me.
KATHY: Don't worry about me. Run. Hide!
Ghost at 11 o'clock!
No, no, no! Get back here!
SARAH: That's my book! Ah!
We gotta go.
Sarah! Sarah, let go of that ghost!
Do not let go of that ghost!
You okay? No, that ghost took the book.
SONNY: Mom! Oh, kids. Help!
No, no, no!
Sarah! SARAH: Mom!
SONNY: It's heading for the Tesla lab.
Slappy brought the tower to life. That's why this is happening.
We have to stop him.
Uh, guys?
Sonny, what do we do? I don't know. You're the older one.
No, no, no. It's me, Mr. Chu!
Mr. Chu?
Shh! Follow me! To the basement now!
Don't ruin the Mylar. I'm saving it for next year. Go, go, go.
Let me get this straight.
We are living a Goosebumps story right now?
Okay, clearly you're a fan.
This is the greatest thing I've ever heard!
Hold on. Let me guess, let me guess, let me guess. Um...
Monster Blood.
No, too on the nose. Yeah, you're right. Um...
The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight.
No. Haunted Halloween.
I don't know that one. How does it end?
That's the problem.
It doesn't.
Hello, Mama.
Remember me?
You put me on your lap.
Put those cute words in my mouth.
What was it you called me? "Bobo"? Ha-ha-ha.
Can't talk?
Don't you worry.
From now on, I'll do the talking for both of us.
I'm gonna make you so proud, Mama.
Onarrak unolom
amol
annodo irram
urrak.
[LAUGHING] It's working.
Yes.
My mind is literally blown right now.
I mean, we get to finish our Goosebumps story!
This isn't a creative-writing exercise, Mr. Chu. Slappy has our mom!
Yeah, and then you get to save your mom. It's Chapter 22:
"The kids save their mom from the demonic dummy."
Well, the only thing I had to save my mom was that book, and I lost it. So...
Sarah. This is not your fault.
If anything, it's my fault. I'm the one who found the book and brought Slappy to life.
And I even told Slappy about Tesla.
Mom trusted me to take care of you guys, and I told her I would save her.
I failed.
I know I always say that I can't wait to go to college and get started on my real life, but you guys are my life.
but you guys are my life.
This is a classic Goosebumps moment. Do you remember Say Cheese and Die--?
This is real life, Chu! Okay.
Guys, Slappy is using the Tesla Tower to power Halloween.
If I can get in there, maybe I can shut it off, and we can save Mom.
But there's monsters everywhere. How are we gonna get past them?
Easy.
Camouflage.
Welcome to my crafts lab.
Wow. ♪ Steady on my grind and got no Time for playing games ♪
Jeez, they're still everywhere.
It's actually working.
Come on. We gotta get to that tower.
SONNY: I can't believe we're really here.
I can barely see out of this thing. Is it cool? Is it awesome?
[WHISPERING] Hey, fanboy. Let's focus.
Right. Sorry.
Let's go.
SARAH [SOFTLY]: Don't. Move.
Come on, let's go. Come on!
Look at this place.
SARAH: It's so creepy.
Stay close.
SAM: No wonder Tesla abandoned this place.
Shh, shh, shh. Do you hear that?
Come on.
STINE: Oh, no.
Not Haunted Halloween.
Oh, my writing was so cliché back then.
I knew it! I knew I came up with that first.
That clever little dummy's writing his own ending.
Not in my book, he's not.
Oh, gnomes.
Don't you dare.
Stay.
Ow! Son of a-- Ah!
Oh, witches!
Get away, witches!
SAM: Guys, do you hear that? Shh!
Wow.
SARAH: Whoa.
Welcome.
Slappy.
Walter? [GRUNTS]
Where's my mother?
Don't you mean our mother?
[IN RASPY VOICE] There's my sweet little babies.
I just love a family reunion.
Mom. What did you do?
SLAPPY: I had a papa once!
He let me down.
But a mother's love is forever.
Turn her back now, you psycho!
Oh, should I?
Unfortunately, I have other plans.
Walter! The book, please.
Yes.
This book.
Go prepare the tower!
I'm going to do what Stine couldn't:
Finish this book, once and for all.
[CHUCKLES] Spoiler alert:
The manuscript gets destroyed in that tower,
and my Halloween family lasts forever!
Mama, babysit the children for me.
Yes, dear.
We can't let him destroy that book.
Sonny, turn this thing off. I'm going after Slappy.
Just you and me now, Slappy.
Can't hear you. I'm too far ahead of you. Hee-hee-hee!
SONNY: This is amperage and this is voltage?
None of these cables make any sense. What about here? Start pulling levers.
No, no, Sam, don't! Ah!
Slappy booby-trapped all this stuff.
Careful, Sarah. It'd be a shame to fall from that height.
Plenty more where that came from.
Come on, Sonny, turn this thing off.
Oh, no. Sonny hurry up.
Oh, no. Sonny hurry up. Slappy's at the top. Do something.
I can't do it, Sam.
Come on, Sonny. You are the smartest kid I know.
Sam, I couldn't even do my little science project. Slappy did that.
And even that one shorted out.
Wait. That's it.
We turn it up. All the way up. We blow the fuse.
Yes! The fuse is over there.
And now to finish this story and destroy the town.
No!
What do you think you're doing?
Writing my own ending.
Spoiler alert: I save the town and put you back where you belong.
SLAPPY: What's the matter?
Writer's block?
Again?
Grab that lever. Yes. This one?
On my count, we push up at the same time.
Ready? Go!
Give me the book.
You're not gonna get this book, Slappy.
I have a friend who might think otherwise.
Nowhere else to run, sis!
Fine. You win, Slappy.
I'll give you the book, but you gotta turn my mom back.
Deal.
It all ends Slappily ever after.
You forgot one thing:
Never judge a book by its cover.
What?
No!
[NORMALLY] Sonny, what's happening?
Mom.
We need to get out of here!
It's working!
Go, kids!
Hello?
Someone called for me?
KATHY: Sarah? Oh! Oh... Mom!
STINE: Hello?
I got your message. I'm here.
Don't worry. Everything's going to be okay.
I need typing paper, a thesaurus,
I need typing paper, a thesaurus, Diet Coke, and a quiet place to compose.
Preferably in a comfortable chair with lumbar support.
Are you R.L. Stine?
Me? No, I'm Dr. Seuss. R.L. Stine was unavailable.
Yes, of course, I'm R.L. Stine!
Then I guess this belongs to you.
Don't open it.
My first book.
You realize I wrote this when I was around your age.
More of an amateur work, really, but I am sure you'll all agree
it shows the undeniable promise of a brilliant young writer.
Why do you have a typewriter?
I was going to save you with it,
although it appears you found a way to save yourselves.
A typewriter? It's been done before.
Once before.
Maybe twice.
Maybe more.
WALTER: Kathy?
Walter, manager at Fred's Pharmacy. It's nice to see you.
Hi. It's nice to see you too. What are you doing here?
I don't know.
Walter! Walter! You got turned into a monster.
You were big, green, ugly. You were Slappy's henchman!
Weather patterns. Very strange weather patterns.
But I think everything's back to normal now.
Fine. Okay, yeah, the weather has been weird. It's true. Okay, thanks. KATHY: What happened to your shirt?
KATHY: What happened to your shirt? WALTER: I don't know.
[IN PIG LATIN] Ixnay on the onsters-may. Go ahead, ollow-fay. SONNY: What?
Go ahead, ollow-fay. SONNY: What? [IN ENGLISH] Means "follow." Pig Latin.
Oh, the youth today.
WALTER: So funny running into you.
Right? I always hoped we'd run into each other outside of work.
WALTER: Yeah, me too.
Hey, if you're not busy next week, would you wanna have some dinner?
Yeah. Yeah, heh, heh. Yeah? That's awesome.
So they don't remember what happened to them?
The transmutation process seems to have wiped their memories clean.
All those who were affected won't remember a thing.
Tommy?
SAM: Are you okay? Oh, my God. Guys.
I had this crazy dream.
I'm so glad to see you.
You know, can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm glad to see you too, Tommy.
Kids falling from the sky.
My work here is done.
I'm a writer too.
Well, an aspiring, very stuck writer at the moment.
My condolences.
All the horrors in the world can't compare to the terrors of the blank page.
Um, any advice on college essays?
Well, first rule of writing: write what you know.
Thirty years, and I couldn't figure out how this book should end.
And somehow you figured out how to finish it in one night.
I believe in you.
Hm. "Write what you know."
SARAH: Recount a time in your life when you faced a fear, challenge or failure.
I think most of us are afraid that we don't have a story to tell.
That there's nothing special about us.
And then a moment comes when you least expect it where you have to step up,
no matter how terrified you are.
But what I've learned is that it's good to be scared sometimes.
Scared of losing the people we love.
Stop, stop! It's a ventriloquist dummy.
Oh. Really?
That's not funny, Mom. Too soon.
No, I like it.
Congratulations, Sonny.
Thank you so much, Principal Harrison.
SARAH: Or scared of not achieving our dreams.
Because those moments remind us just how special our stories really are.
Here's to us. Indeed.
Hey, Sarah! Hi, Mr. Chu.
CHU: Watch this.
[CHUCKLES] I like it.
Yeah, I just made it life-size this year. You know, just in case.
No, seriously, you know, just in case.
Right. I'll see you later, Mr. Chu.
Bye!
SARAH: And maybe when you face enough of your fears
life stops being so scary after all. ♪ Now's the day To make our dreams alive ♪
Hey, honey.
What happened?
I got in. I knew it. I knew you could do it.
Oh, I'm so proud of you!
I guess I'm proud.
Thanks, Sonny. Come on, bring it in.
Congratulations.
[CHUCKLES] Here, take off your jacket. Guys, give her some ornaments, please.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm so happy! Ha-ha-ha!
Here, put that right there. Yeah, I like that one.
Finally, a new book.
Yes.
SLAPPY: Hello, Papa.
Slappy! I thought the book got you.
Maybe those others, but not me.
Why is that?
You know I always survive.
You wrote me that way.
In fact, I wrote my own story while I was gone.
And guess what.
You're the main character.
No.
No!
You try living in a book for a while, Papa.

Ooh, we can't stand them.
They cheated us out of winning the city talent show in '64.

Yeah, Santa gave it to me.
-Are you saying Santa's not real? -No.
He is not saying that.
Come on!
We all know Santa isn't the one who's buying all those gifts.

Oh, yeah. [chuckles] I almost forgot how cute it looked on me.
It's for the homeless.
But it has my name on it.
Nobody's gonna want to wear this, unless their name is Jade.
When it's 30 degrees outside and you're homeless,
fashion goes out the window.
[laughs] How can you be homeless and have a window?
Hey, hey, hey!

I beg your pardon?
My voice is on point.
And that point is piercing my eardrums.
Oh! Let me stop playing with Amelia before her sensitive butt stops talking to me...
again! [laughs]
I am not sensitive,
and when I stop talking to you, it's for a good reason.
Oh, I don't know about that.
I remember when you stopped talking to her for two years
'cause she borrowed your pearl earrings.
She stole my earrings.
-I borrowed them. -Stole.
-Borrowed. -Stole.
Did you ask me to wear them? -I... -Stole 'em.
-I... -Stole 'em.
Okay, okay. Oh, remember the time you...
what, stopped speaking to me for about a year-and-a-half
because I used some brochure to kill a fly.
That was not a brochure.
That was Ernestine Brown's funeral program.
Girl, you didn't even like Ernestine.
But I loved her program!
She looked like a young Cicely Tyson.
After all those cigarettes, she looked like an old Mike Tyson.
Oh, well, uh, what about that time, what, about-- about three years ago,
you stopped speaking to me over some funky bingo card.
It was not just a bingo card, it was my bingo card,
-and you won ten big ones with it. -[Maybelle gasps]
Whoa, whoa, nobody told me that.
Girl, you won $10,000 off Amelia's bingo card?
No, ten dollars.
Y'all stopped talking over ten dollars?
Of course not. That would be petty. I stopped talking to her
'cause she wouldn't give me the two dollars I paid for the card.
When you say it out loud, it does seem kind of silly.
[whispers] Even if you whisper it, it's still silly.
You guys have got to do better.
Oh, yeah, you right. Oh, you know what? Hey, Amelia. For the record, here.
Oh, no, I couldn't.
[laughs] Yeah, take it.
-No. -Yes.
-No! -Yes!
-No more-- -I'll take it.
I'm sick of being in the middle of you two my whole life.
I'll tell you what, I want to be buried way across the cemetery
so I can finally get some rest.
Fine, we'll put you with your ex-husbands.
Ooh, well, now, should we put her between Curly and Larry, or Larry and Moe?
That's just mean.
I prefer Curly and Moe.
[imitating Curly] Soitenly!
Mazzi really wants that Meganoid-3000 robot,
but it's sold out everywhere.
Oh! Relax, Cocoa. Our little surprise is here.
This will totally convince him.
Yo! You guys order a Santa?
What is he waiting for?
I don't-- I-I don't know. Uh, is-- is everything okay, Santa?
Uh, is-- is everything okay, Santa?
I'm stuck!
He's not Santa.
-See, I told you he wasn't real. -You're a fraud!
[Shaka sighs] I'm really proud of us.
I know, right? We slayed the roughing it game.
What's all this?
Our tent.
We roughed it out here last night, just like you said.
Our waffles are ready.
You kids have clearly misunderstood the spirit of this exercise.
Do you really think homeless people have all these luxuries?
Well, you can't be sure that they don't.
Well, I can.
You can keep this tent, but everything else goes back in the house.
Wait, everything?
Everything, except you two. You're gonna stay out here another night.
But it'll be really hard to stay out here without all of our stuff.
Now you're getting it.
Oh, oh, we need that.
You're homeless.
Get creative.
That's just nasty.
Wow. Were you guys this good back in the day?
Oh, girl. We were more supreme than the Supremes.
More marvelous than the Marvelettes.
-Spicier than the Spice Girls. -[Maybelle] Hello!
So, what happened?
-[Maybelle] Hmm. -Yeah, Dot, tell her what happened.
We were invited to open for Smokey Robinson.
We, as in a group.
Uh, go ahead.
Well, um, Amelia and Maybelle, well, they... they were busy, so... And I went at it alone.
And from that, I was offered a solo contract.
I saw an opportunity and I took it.
You took it 'cause you're selfish.
Just because I looked out for myself, it doesn't make me selfish.
That's kind of the definition.
Well, what was I supposed to do?
Amelia, she was pregnant, she was on bed rest,
and Maybelle, well, she was already on her second marriage.
I was not!
Oh, okay. Yes, I was.
Well, it's a shame, but groups break up all of the time.
Exactly.
Sure, feelings, they hurt at first...
but, um, it's been... 40 years.
Let it go.
We were not just a group.
We were sisters.
If anybody wanted to fight either one of us, they had to fight all of us.
We didn't just have each other's backs,
we had each other's hearts.
Sissy...
I know that--
You abandoned us!
And I told you then that I would never forget it.
Oh, my, I didn't realize that you both still felt this way. I really...
I'm sorry.
You know what?
I have gotten over this.
I mean, we were young, we were feeling ourself...
-It's okay, Dot. -It is not okay!
It never was.
And it never will be.
What are you trying to say, Amelia?
This Fabulous Williams Sisters reunion is canceled...
and I'm not speaking to you.
I didn't even feel this bad when Destiny's Child broke up.
Well, that was it.
I was the Beyoncé of our group, and just like her,
there are people still hatin' on me for moving on.
Get real, Dot.
I was the Beyoncé of the group.
Everybody knows that I was the Beyoncé if there ever was one!
Uh... I thought you wasn't speaking to me.
I was talking to them.
-[Maybelle grumbles] -I can't believe you did that to your sister...
sister.
It's so cold.
I can't feel my toes! I can't feel my toes!
That's because you're feeling my toes.
My bad.
[sighs] I'm hungry.
Going four hours without eating does strange things to a man.
Yeah.
I'm going on the record. Being homeless sucks.
Is that a girl going through our trash?
Hi.
I'm sorry. Is this your turf?
Tonight it is.
Oh, n-no. You can-- you can keep those.
You sure?
This is at least three dollars worth of bottles.
Yeah.
You two must be new to the streets.
How can you tell? Because your head's not covered.
You lose most of your body heat from your head.
So if you don't have a hat, keep a blanket over it.
Give me a shoe.
This will keep your feet warm.
Thanks.
I'm Jade McKellan and that's my brother, Shaka.
Hi, I'm Crystal Cooper.
Are you all alone out here? Where are your parents?
My mom and little sister are at the shelter.
-Jade, let's go stay there. -Oh, it's full now.
If you get in line really early, you can sometimes score a bed.
Why don't they have room for everyone?
I guess there's just too many people who need help.
Make sure you guys stick together.
You can wash up at the gas station on King Boulevard.
They're pretty nice.
Christmas is the best time of the year to go through people's trash.
People are always throwing out their old stuff
to make room for their new stuff.
Look...
a perfectly good apple.
People are so wasteful.
Yeah.
They are.
My hands are freezing. [blows]
I got a hack for that.
Put them in your pockets.
Right.
Take these.
Oh, no, I-I can't. Then you'll be cold.
It's okay. I've got a spot inside tonight.
You need them more than me.
Thanks.
According to their website, there are five Meganoid-3000s in there,
and one of them is going home with us.
I sure hope I can get one for my great-grandson.
-You're cute. -[laughs]
She doesn't stand a chance. Nope!
All right, here is the plan.
-This is the toy section. -Okay.
When the doors open, you run and block for me.
While you hold everyone off,
I'll grab a Meganoid-3000 and meet you at checkout.
[laughs] Love it.
Sixteen years in the NFL about to pay off in a big way! [laughs]
[Cocoa] Ready?
-[yells] -Oh! No! Wait, wait! No! Moz!
Wait! Moz! Wait!
Oh, oh, oh! No! Not-- Not his head! Not his head! Ah!
-Programs? -Merry Christmas.
[woman] Merry Christmas.
Hey! Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas. -[laughs] Merry Christ... mas.
Do you still think about what could have been if you ladies hadn't broken up?
Sometimes.
We could have been rich and famous.
Definitely.
But if you were rich and famous, you wouldn't have this family.
I'd just replace them with a bunch of housekeepers. Oh! [laughs]
[laughs] Come on, M'Dear.
You couldn't have gone on tour, you were pregnant with Moz,
and you probably wouldn't have had Daniel and Grace.
Oh, you can't say that for sure.
You're right.
You're not the first person to wonder, "What if?"
But... if you think about it...
is what you missed better than what you have?
Cocoa.
My dear, sweet Cocoa, come here.
Yes?
You need a mint.
Take it.
Here you go. Yeah. Merry Christmas.
[clears throat] Okay, back together for this Christmas only,
the Fabulous...
Williams Sisters!
Oh, Lord.
Correction.
The Fabulous Williams Sister.
Thank you.
Stop the music. [chuckles]
Happy holidays, saints.
[crowd] Happy holidays.
I'd like to talk to you a bit about life.
I don't have a good one.
I have a great one.
And even with all of my many, many blessings,
sometimes I still feel like I really didn't get what I wanted.
And I've always blamed my sister Dot for that.
-Here we go again. -Mmm.
But instead of blaming her, I should be thanking her,
because when I look out and I see my husband, my children,
my grandbabies...
I am just so grateful...
for what is.
Amelia...
Well, does this mean you... you'll finally forgive me?
If you'll forgive me.
-Oh! Amelia! -[crowd] Aww.
-[applause] -Sisters! Oh, Maybelle!
Oh, Maybelle!
Now let's give the people what they came here to see,
the Fabulous Williams Sisters!
Now?
-I'm really in no shape to sing. -Me neither.
Well, okay.
We do have the Huell Sisters in the house.
[all] Sit down!
I would like to dedicate this song to my daughter-in-law, Cocoa.
You may not look like it, but you are one smart cookie.
Hit it, fellas!
Wow. They could still be Destiny's Child.
Except they all are Beyoncé.

Did you find her?
Her family can stay in my room, it's snowing.
I called both homeless shelters.
No Crystal, no Coopers registered there in the past month.
That's so weird.
I really wanted to help her the way she helped us.
Well, until we find her, we'll just have to find a way to pay it forward.
Grandpa, I've got a bunch of clothes I want to donate.
And I've got lots of toys.
Amen.
Amen.
Mazzi's gonna be devastated
when he realizes he didn't get that Meganoid-3000.
Yeah, you're right. You tell him.
We'll both break it to him. All right.
Who left all these lights on?
I was the last one out. They were off when I closed the door.
Well, who built the fire then?
Well, we were all at church. Did somebody break in?
Whoever it was ate all of our cookies.
Look! Look at all the toys!
The real Santa came!
I got it!
I got it! I got my Meganoid-3000! I got it! Did you guys...
-No. -No.
-Honestly, it wasn't us. -Did you guys?
I don't even know what that thing is.
You guys were right.
Santa is real.
I hope he left me some batteries!
Our little boy believes in the magic of Christmas again.
So do I.
Now that, family, is truly a Christmas miracle.

four legs, and a single head made of two faces.
We were happy.
Complete.
So complete that the gods,
fearing our wholeness would quell our need for worship, cleaved us in two...
leaving our split selves to wander the Earth in misery.
Forever longing.
Longing.
-[panting] -Longing...
for the other half of our soul.
It is said that when one half finds its other...
there's an unspoken understanding.
A unity.
And each would know no greater joy...
than this.
-[students chattering] -[locker clatters]
[narrator] Of course...
the ancient Greeks never went to high school.
Good hang out.
Whatever. [sighs]
[narrator] Or they'd realize...
Crap.
[narrator] ...we don't need the gods to mess things up for us.
If you ask me...
people spend far too much time looking for someone to complete them.
How many people find perfect love?
Or if they do...
make it last?
More evidence of Camus' theory that life is irrational...
and meaningless.
And that, my friends, is some A-plus love philosophy right there.
Or A-minus if Mrs. G is in a bad mood.
Either way, it's an A or you don't pay.
Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the immoral persons.
And everyone who loves and practices lying...
[boy] Ellie Chu!
Chugga chugga Chu Chu! [laughs]
[teacher] Fantastic. [sighs] The angels weep with joy.
Next up...
the winter talent show. Mandatory for all seniors.
This is your last chance to strut your stuff. Mandatory.
[muted] Once again, the wall tubas must be checked out before use.
These are very delicate instruments with sticky valves.
Some bad news.
Someone left their Dr. Pepper in our storage cupboard.
-Imagine a world without flutes... -[students whispering]
-[girl] Did you mute me, Bruce? -[Bruce, softly] No, Kaitlin, I didn't.
[Kaitlin whispers] I can tell if you mute me, Bruce. I can tell.
[boy 1] Jerry's parents are in Spokane...
-[boy 2] I'll bring the Xbox. -[sends text]
[teacher] ...please bring it back.
-No questions asked. -[phones vibrating]
Is there a problem?
[students, overlapping] No, Mr. Flores.
[Mr. Flores] Next up, we had an issue...
[girl whispers] I heard his sister went to Seattle with the church.
She's majoring in sociology.
[whispers] Hey. Send this down to the big guy.
-[girl] I think I'm going deaf. -Oh, thank you very much.
No, but honestly, man, the man I want to be when I'm older
is not the man I am today, you know what I'm saying?
[girl whispers] Aster!
-So, you've just gotta keep living, man. -[girl] Always has her head in a book.
-You've just gotta keep living life. -[Mr. Flores tapping] Choir, stand up.
Let's all turn to page 49.
-[narrator] In case you haven't guessed... -[song continues] ...this is not a love story.
[coach] Are you men or are you losers?
-[boy 1] Come on, ladies, let's go! -[boy 2] Coming through!
[narrator] Or not one where anyone gets what they want.
[coach] Munsky!
[teacher] Notice the lack of fire and brimstone in No Exit.
We are the source of our own hell.
Five hundred words on Sartre's use of thwarted desire, Monday.
-Six different takes on Plato. Impressive. -Just the one.
That's what I tell the bartender.
How come you never turn me in?
And have to read the actual essays they'd write?
-You know I'm going to E-dub. -Damn shame.
Damn full ride.
I can live at home and, plus, I get to stay in lovely Squahamish.
-Hell-quahamish. -It's not that bad.
Okay, it's not that good either, but it's what's happening.
I spent four of the best years of my life at Grinnell.
And look at you, back home in Hell-quahamish.
You're right. Stay away from the liberal arts.
-Try not to get fired over the weekend. -Are you kidding?
Everyone in this town fears God, but you know who God fears?
The Teachers Union.
-[rock music plays over truck radio] -[boy] Chugga chugga Chu Chu.
[boy 2] Hey!
Hey.
Hey!
Hey!
Hold up!
[Ellie] Whoa!
What is wrong with you?
[stammers] I'm sorry. I, uh...
Ten dollars for three pages, $20 for three to ten.
Not in the over-ten-page biz.
No, I'm not trying to cheat.
Nobody is. Whose class is it for?
No, it-- it's not... Um...
-What's this? -A letter.
-Who writes letters these days? -I-- I thought it'd seem romantic.
-Can't help you. -I-- I just need a few words. Good ones.
I'm not writing to Aster Fl--
To some girl.
It'd be wrong. A letter is personal. It's supposed to be authentic.
-That'd be awesome. -No! I can't be you being authen--
Get a thesaurus, use spell-check. Good luck, Romeo.
-[Ellie scoffs] -No, I can pay more for authentic.
[in Mandarin] Did you call the power company?
They don't understand my accent.
Did you try?
Best part.
"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
[in Mandarin] I'll call tomorrow.
-[line rings] -[woman] Inland Power And Light.
I'm calling for account 460A38.
Please hold.
[automated voice] Please re-enter your selection.
Bill. Extension.
Please hold.
[sighs] These hallways are murder.
I'm Ellie Chu.
Yes, I know.
You've only been playing my dad's services every Sunday for, like, four years.
You're his favorite heathen. He can't handle mediocre accompanists.
Even if they are saved.
Remains Of The Day.
Loved it.
All that barely repressed longing.
"I'm Ellie Chu"?
[woman on phone] Yes, I know. Your bill is three months overdue, Mrs. Chu.
If we don't get a minimum payment of $50, your power will terminate tomorrow.
Fifty dollars, one letter. After that, you're on your own.
Yes!
[boy] "Dear Aster Flores: I think you're really beautiful.
Even if you were ugly, I'd want to know you,
because you are smart and nice, too."
[Ellie] "It's hard to find all those things in one girl.
But even if you were only two of those things, I'd be into it.
But you're, like, all three, just to be clear."
She's like all three.
Thanks for clarifying.
"About me.
Some people think I'm the cutest one in my family.
Those people being my grandma...
who's dead now.
Never mind about my dead grandma.
All I'm saying is that I like fries. I like dipping them in my milkshake.
Is that weird?
It's actually really tasty.
Would you like to try that with me sometime?
I work part-time and I have a truck. Let me know whenever.
Thanks.
Paul Munsky, second string tight end...
football."
-So what you're trying to say is-- -I'm in love with her.
Have you ever spoken to her?
I'm not good with words.
But you know you love her?
I know I think about her when I wake up.
And when I'm doing my sprints.
And when I'm eating my mom's bratwurst and when I'm saying my prayers--
That just means you're stubborn. Not that you're in love.
No, it's love.
Love makes you screwy.
Don't you get screwy?
No.
[Ellie sighs, mutters] This whole section needs...
Although, that fry thing does sound good.
A dangling modifier.
Oh, I get it.
Get what?
You've never been in love.
You want a letter about love? I'll write you a letter about love.
One that'll make her fall in love with me, not storm off in a huff like you're doing.
[in Mandarin] This isn't even American. How are you going to learn English?
Shh.
[in English] Best part.
[Mr. Chu, in French] "Longing...
longing for a wave of love to swell up in me."
[Paul] You sealed it.
No, I'm sure it's good.
[Ellie] Hushmo me.
[Paul] Hey.
-[bicycle squeaking] -Hey!
Hey!
-She wrote back. -[brakes squeal]
[Aster] "I like Wim Wenders, too.
Wouldn't have plagiarized him, though."
Who's Wim Wenders and why'd you cheat off him?
-I didn't cheat off of him. -No, I looked up "plagiarize."
-I kind of cheated off him. -I paid you!
-But this is good. -How?
It's...
It's like a game. She's, like, challenging us.
But in a good way.
So, uh...
we're... we're still in the game.
Yep. Mm-hmm.
We are. So...
yay.
Game on, Aster Flores.
Game on.
-[Ellie] "Dear Aster: Okay, you got me." -[crossing bell dinging]
"I sometimes hide behind other people's words.
For one thing, I know nothing about love.
I'm 17. I've lived in Squahamish my whole life."
[Paul] Such a downer.
-It's not a downer. -A major downer.
-Ask her to hang out. -[Ellie scoffs]
[Ellie] What exactly is...
hanging out?
You know, uh, hanging out.
-But, like, what do you do? -[boy] Munsky, what's up?
Uh... uh, confession.
-Want to go to Joey's and hang out? -Yeah.
[Ellie] "I hang out with my friends.
-I keep my head down." -[panting]
[Ellie] "I'm a simple..."
-[woman] Paulie! -"...guy."
This meat won't grind itself.
"Which is to say...
if I knew what love was,
I would quote myself."
[boy] Right here, man. People, air, weather.
Why would we ever leave?
[softly] In here!
[softly] Isn't this sacrilegious?
[whispers] She wrote back.
[Aster] "Dear Paul..."
-[Mr. Flores preaches indistinctly] -"You know it takes 11 muscles to yawn?
This is the sort of weird fact I find myself recalling -to keep myself from..." -[Mr. Flores continues indistinctly]
-to keep myself from..." -[Mr. Flores continues indistinctly]
"...well, yawning."
We believe that God loves us.
"Or showing anything I feel really."
-[Mr. Flores] We believe blindly and... -"So, yeah...
I turn to other people's words, too."
[man] ...imagine how the right gravel can change your life.
[in Spanish] Sweetheart, sit up straight, please.
Like a lady.
[Aster] "When you're a pretty girl,
and I know it makes me sound conceited,
but that's why you're even writing me, right?"
[Aster] "When you're a pretty girl, people want to give you things."
It would look so cute on you.
-[Aster] "What they really want..." -Oh.
"...is to make you like them."
Thanks.
"Not like them as in, 'I like you,'
but like them as in, 'I am like you.'"
Like...
so cute on you.
Oh.
Oh, you-- you mean right now?
[Aster] "So I'm like a lot of people.
Which makes me kind of no one."
-Can I text her now? -Too soon.
No, I'm gonna do it.
If you want her to think you're like everyone else.
[Ellie] "I never really thought about the oppression of fitting in before.
The good thing about being different is that no one expects you to be like them."
[Paul running] Hey, wait for me!
[Aster] "Doesn't everyone think they're different, but...
pretty much we're all different in the same way?"
-[bell rings] -[Ellie] "Says the girl perched on the rarefied peak of Mt. Popularity."
Babe!
Taco time.
[Aster] "Easy, Mr. I Know Nothing About Love.
I may surprise you."
[girl 1] So, where do you wanna go?
[girl 2] I want to go somewhere where I could get pajamas.
[girl 1] Do you wanna go to Gap?
[girl 2] The one in Tukwila has a GapBody.
[girl 1] I love GapBody.
It has, like, 15 dressing rooms.
[girl 2] Oh, it's the better Gap.
[girl 1] So much better than the one in Wenatchee.
[girl 2] Ugh. Wenatchee...
Oh, my God. Go look at Molly's posts.
-[girl 1] Eww. -[girl 2] She looks so gross. -[girl 1] She looks so gross. -[girl 2] Why would she post that?
-[girl 1] She looks so gross. -[girl 2] Why would she post that?
[girl 1] I have no idea.
[girl 2] Trig checked in at Dick's Fry Fry.
[girl 1] Aster is so lucky.
[girl 2 scoffs] Totes lucky. His family owns half of Squahamish.
[girl 1] Hers doesn't even own their house.
-You're so rude. -[girl 1 giggles]
You know that it's true.
-[girl 2] Yeah, it's true. -[girl 1 laughs]
[Ellie] "What's surprising is people don't see what they're not looking for."
[Aster] "The obvious unseen."
So...
this is why half my class is failing their essays.
I'll be reopen for business soon enough.
And this can't go on much longer.
[Aster] "I've been thinking about what you said -about seeing and not seeing." -[indistinct chatter]
[man] Yes, I do!
[Aster] "I had a painting teacher once tell me that
the difference between a good painting and a great painting...
is typically five strokes.
And they're usually the five boldest strokes in the painting.
The question, of course...
is which five strokes?"
[Ellie] "I get it. After one's slaved away at making a pretty good painting,
the last thing you'd want to do is make a bold stroke and potentially..."
[Aster] "Ruin everything.
That's why I gave up painting.
Still, I wonder if that is how I'm living my life."
Hey, babe?
Which one?
Right one, right?
Great.
[Aster] "It's a...
pretty good life.
Probably the best life one could hope for in Squahamish."
[Ellie] "Perhaps...
but how well do you really know Squahamish?"
[Ellie] "Oh, so that's your boldest stroke?"
[Aster] "I'm into the slow build. What was that?"
[Ellie] "Decisiveness.
But, please, take all the time you need to be bold."
[Aster] "Is this bold enough for you?"
[Ellie] "And thus was abstract art born."
[Aster] "And transformed."
[man] Hey!
Hey!
-[thunder rumbles] -[Aster] "Or not."
[Ellie] "Everything beautiful is ruined eventually.
Maybe that's the thing.
If you do ruin your painting...
you gotta know you have everything in you to get to that pretty good painting again."
[Aster] "But if you never do the bold stroke..."
[Ellie] "You'll never know if you could've had a great painting."
[teacher] ...triangle is different.
All polygons with three sides.
Take one side away,
now it's just an angle.
Add a side, that's a square.
[Paul] When does the dating start?
This is dating.
No, dating is burgers and fries and shakes.
And maybe another order of fries.
And...
-I'm gonna text her. -Wait, what?
-At a certain point, you've gotta close. -We're not at that point!
We're way past that point.
-[engine revving] -[cheers continue]
[Ellie] Oh, my God.
I've gone... [groans]
"Little sister hacked my phone.
Can we take this to a safer platform?
Ghost Messenger?
My handle's...
Smith Corona."
-Who's Smith Corona? -Just a guy.
-[Paul] Crap. -[Ellie groans]
I'm the king of the mud! Babe! Babe, did you get that?
Caption it, "Mudding king."
[all] Mudding king! Mudding king! Mudding king! Mudding--
[automated voice] New ghost message.
-Yeah, we did it! -Yes!
[Ellie] She prefers abstract to representational.
If she brings up Remains Of The Day,
talk about how the movie loses out by not spending more time on the Nazis.
[Paul] Relax. I got this.
-[Ellie] But-- -[Paul] It's a date, not a book report.
I got two of them signed when he came to Powell's Books last year. [chuckles]
I drove all night to get there.
Oh, uh...
Cool.
You've probably already read it.
-Thought you'd like one. -Uh, yeah, totally.
No, I-- I love, uh...
Nazis.
[Paul over speaker] I mean, the-- the ones in the book.
I mean, like, more of those Nazis. Am I right?
Uh, speaking of Nazis...
thank you for meeting me here.
My dad...
he isn't a Nazi exactly, but, uh...
he can be pretty strict.
You know, people talk.
Um, yeah. Talk. Ugh.
It's nice...
to make a new friend, though.
Oh.
A friend.
Good.
They use Reddi-wip.
Oh.
It's, uh... from a can.
Uh... but it's okay.
[Paul] It wasn't that bad.
What about that date wasn't bad? You have nothing in common.
Not yet, but--
Game over.
[Paul panting] I can't give up. [Ellie] Look, you and Aster Flores, not gonna happen.
-[boy] Chugga chugga Chu Chu! -[Paul] Hey!
-Who are you calling "Chu Chu"? -[boy] Shit, let's get out of here!
[Paul] What kind of wusses say dumb shit and then drive away?
Yeah, you'd better run!
What?
[Ellie] Aster Flores thinks you're into abstract art and repressed British literature.
-Yeah. -None of that is you.
It could be. I started reading that Remains Of The Day book.
-Really? -Yeah. I fell asleep a few times,
but I'm still reading it.
That's gotta count for something.
There are no points for effort.
Isn't that what love is? How much effort you put into loving someone?
Well, whatever love is, -we just blew it with Aster Flores. -[phone chimes]
Yes!
No, I can do this.
We can do this.
Okay.
I'll pay you double.
You don't have to pay me.
Don't be weird, dude. Why else would you do this?
No, I've got savings.
[Ellie] Next date is three weeks away.
-Three weeks? -You told her you're slammed
-Three weeks? -You told her you're slammed -with football training. -I-- I did?
Yes. Also, you're in a debate on who's the better Hepburn.
[Mr. Chu] Who there?
[in Mandarin] Ba, did we wake you?
School project.
Hi, Ellie Chu's dad.
We don't have time to school you on everything Aster thinks you are, so we have to be selective. Deep versus broad-based learning.
so we have to be selective. Deep versus broad-based learning.
-Huh? -We spy on her, then cram you on her greatest hits.
Oh, cool.
-Are you ready for this? -Yes.
[hushed] Are you ready for this?
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
Shh!
So, in No Exit, three people are trapped in hell.
A door opens, but nobody leaves.
[Paul] That's nuts. He can't stand these people.
A door opens and he doesn't leave?
[Ellie] He's trapped in hell. It's a metaphor for existence.
[Paul] My nana hated Minnesota. She left.
[Ellie] Your nana wasn't one of the great thinkers of the 20th century.
-[Paul] Nana's not trapped in hell either. -[Ellie groans]
Hey! Hey, where are you going?
The hell's got into Munsky?
You're like some marvelous, distant, well, queen, I guess.
You're so cool and fine.
[Hepburn] I don't want to be worshiped, I want to be loved.
Key thing about The Philadelphia Story is it's a plea for tolerance.
Check this out. I'm calling it taco sausage. Do you want a bite?
No. So tolerance...
Two hand foods, one great taste.
Conversation is like ping-pong.
I hit one and then you...
What the...
Oops.
We're writing a profile on the student we most admire.
Oh, cool, cool.
-Views on women in the workplace? -Does Aster like lean meats?
[both] What are you doing?
-I'm good cop. -Then how come you aren't smiling?
I'll smile when you follow the plan that I carefully--
I'm surprised more kids haven't asked to interview me. Huh.
I'm going in. I'm going in with my smile.
[announcer] Looks like The Moose have a man open.
[Paul] You're not hungry?
Not if it's not time to eat.
Now that's weird.
Hey, uh, can I ask you a question?
I don't want to try a taco sausage.
Why Squahamish?
Just, like, your dad seems so unhappy here and you also seem kind of unhappy.
-I gotta go. -No, no, no, wait.
No, you're not taking this seriously. I have a ton of work I have to do.
No, just, you're so smart. Like, too smart to, like--
Waste my time trying to win you a girl who'll never look your way?
-No, it just seems weird. -You're weird!
No-- Yes.
-Enjoy your happy life in Squahamish. -No, no...
The thing about No Exit is it's like how what I really want is to run my own shop,
with new recipes. And-- And FYI, taco sausage is really effing good.
Okay, but I'm the fourth son
and my family's been making the same sausage for 49 years
and it doesn't matter if they're going broke, or out of style,
they're Nana's recipes. If Ma can't have Nana, at least she can make her sausages.
If I break away, it'll break her heart. And it's either her heart or mine.
So I stay.
We had to go where my dad could get a job.
He studied trains?
Engineering.
PhD, no less.
So, uh,
he became the station manager at Squahamish.
To start.
The plan was to be promoted to system engineer.
Or anything engineer.
Squahamish was a jumping-off point.
It turns out speaking good English trumps having a PhD.
Or one from China anyway.
And my dad, he--
Doesn't speak very good.
-He's not bad. -I don't speak very good either.
True.
What's your excuse?
How do you feel about pot roast?
I should get back to the station.
I know, but we've gotta eat.
-[engine starts] -[boy] Mom!
[girl] Tommy, stop friending my friends!
Would you like to weigh in or are you just gonna scream throughout the meal?
I'll deal with the dog wrestling.
-Mom! -It's your fault!
[Paul] Or we could go to your place?
Match energy, match strokes, and just say one thing.
Where were you born?
In Squahamish.
What about you?
Okay. Good. That wasn't so hard.
But where were you born?
I don't need talking practice.
It just seems like a really short conversation.
I was born in Xuzhou, China.
When did you come here?
When I was five.
-What do you like about Squahamish? -Uh...
I've never been anywhere else.
Me neither.
[Mr. Flores] How does Satan get his message through?
Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the immoral persons. [groans]
Does he write letters?
-No, he causes us to question. -[phone vibrates]
Question our lives, our path.
Our very faith in God.
-Satan plants the seed of doubt... -[phone vibrates]
...and, from that seed, grows sin.
Sin is everywhere.
We're lucky to live in a good town like Squahamish.
But the world is changing.
Let us stay strong against Satan's call,
lest sin creep in and destroy the good life God has prepared for us.
You know what it's like to finally meet someone your age who gets you?
You know where else you can meet people your age who get you?
College.
[Paul] You should send some emojis.
[whispers] I'm not sending her emojis.
Do pineapple, owl, caterpillar with glasses.
[Ellie] What does that mean?
That doesn't mean anything.
[Paul] Glasses make the caterpillar look smart.
Favorite food?
Braised pork over rice. Yours?
[both] Taco sausage.
-Does braised pork have five-spice powder? -How do you know five-spice powder?
I kind of creeped in your cabinets.
I'm always looking for new spices.
Giving up on the taco sausage?
Oh, no way. I've been writing to the paper in Wenatchee for months now.
If I could just get the guy to taste it.
-The gateway to greatness is Wenatchee. -Yeah.
Hey, you gotta try it.
What do the other Munskys think?
They haven't tried it.
Taco sausage has a nice ring to it.
Yeah, right?
Hey.
Yeah?
What was your mom like?
Young, funny, dead.
No, before she died.
Young, funny...
fun.
She sounds cool.
Yeah.
I bet she would've tried the taco sausage.
What do you like about Aster?
She's pretty...
and...
smart...
and she's never mean.
And she smells like fresh-ground flour.
Why?
Just wondering.
What else could I like about her?
I don't know.
How her eyes look right into yours.
How...
she twirls her hair when she's reading.
How...
her laugh...
busts out like she can't help herself and she stops being so perfect
for just a few moments.
She has at least five different voices.
How you could live in an ocean of her thoughts and...
feel like she knows,
like really knows...
I'm so stupid.
-I just meant-- -No, I'm so dumb.
-No-- -Like a real idiot.
-Don't think that I-- -No, what you said.
That's what you say when you love someone.
No, I-- I was just talking.
-I would never, ever actually-- -No, it is.
And-- And you don't even care.
I mean, I love her and I can't even...
You try...
harder than...
anyone I've ever met...
I mean, with the possible exception of my dad with my mom...
to show a girl that...
you love them.
And if love isn't the effort you put in...
then...
what is it?
Yeah?
Yeah.
[Ellie] I can't believe you drink Yakult.
[Paul] Stadium vending machine.
Coach is gonna provide it free. Keeps him regular.
Seriously?
The only Asian grocery is three hours by bike.
Do not run after her train.
Do not.
Do not! Ugh.
-[Paul] It's kinda sweet. -[Ellie] Kinda trite.
[Paul] Uh, it shows that he cares.
[Ellie] It shows he's a moron.
Who outruns trains?
That girl's thinking, "Thank God I got out before wasting my life on that idiot."
She looks sad.
Then she's a moron, too.

[Paul] What up, haters? Who rocked their second date?
-Number 86, Paul Munsky! -[music plays softly over speakers]
And now, his side-girl's gonna rock the senior recital.
[scoffs] It's a piano solo.
-You're gonna be awesome. -I'm gonna be puking.
You're always playing for an audience.
On the side.
Not on stage, alone.
-[Paul] You're gonna crush it. -Hmm.
Oh, did I tell you that some food guy from the paper in Tukwila wrote me?
He must have heard about me from the guy in Wenatchee.
He likes how my sausage sounds and he wants to try it.
Boom! It-- It's Munsky time.
Hey, look at you.
So...
what did you and Aster talk about?
Uh, I don't know.
You know, we got milkshakes and fries.
And we held hands.
It was, uh, quiet...
and...
nice.
And then she had curfew, so we walked back to her car and...
I kissed her.
How...
does that...
happen?
What? The kiss.
I kissed her.
How do you know she wants to be kissed?
She gives you a look.
A look?
Yeah, like, um...
Okay, she gives you a look and, when you see the look, you make your move.
Otherwise you look like a real putz.
-Hmm. -And now we've got, like, a date date,
not just a friend date, when she gets back from some youth group in Sacramento.
There are dressing rooms, you know.
-I'll just get this. -Really?
-Yeah. -No, it's just...
You know, without the jeans and the flannel shirt...
you look weird.
Gee, thanks.
It just doesn't look like you.
Uh, all girled up.
I know.
Go to the dressing room. I'll toss you some things.
But you're a dude.
I have a sister.
Go.
Well, our next senior needs no introduction.

that I can tell I have been drinking spirits.
Because I have to pee far more often...
than would be indicated by plain punch.
So don't think I haven't been monitoring the situation.
Cool, cool. How many cups have you monitored?
Let's get you home.
Okay.
[mom] He's at practice, but you can leave it in his room.
[Aster] Yeah, it's just something silly I thought he'd like.
We went as far as Sekiu once,
but we never made it all the way to California.
You're quite the little traveler. I would love to go to California.
-[Aster chuckles] -Oh, it's Paul's Chinese friend. I didn't hear you come in.
I was just, um, dropping off some books.
-Aster was just dropping off-- Tommy! -[loud whirring upstairs]
Hands off the grinder!
Tommy!
Hi.
Hi.
So, uh, you-- you and Paul, you guys...
Oh, God, no. No, no, no. He is, like, totally, 100% into you.
Oh.
You know about us?
He wanted to do some extra reading so...
I lent him some books.
He's doing extra reading?
For you.
That's, uh...
That's sweet.
It is.
[chuckles] On our first date, uh...
I just kept...
talking about books.
I think I almost drove him off.
I can be such a nervous idiot.
You could never be an idiot.
I mean, Paul would never think that about you, because he's way into you.
-I should get back to the station. -No, yeah, no.
Oh, it's just some silly thing I made on my trip.
I like this stroke off to the side.
Lonely,
but hopeful.
Yeah.
He'll love it.
Hey.
Can I come with?
To the station?
I already lied to my dad about where I'd be.
I have the day.
You get to do that every day?
Twice. 6:40 a.m. and 11:40 p.m weekdays. 12:10 p.m. and 9:20 p.m weekends.
Give or take an hour.
That is awesome.
-It's a real blast. -No, it's-- it's so...
master of the universe.
A teeny-tiny universe. [sighs]
Oh, well. At least you rule something.
Hey, what about those?
My dad doesn't trust them.
Do you want to get outta here?
Where are we going?
-♪ You think you know ♪ -To my favorite secret place.
Whoa.
Right?
Are these deciduous trees?
[Aster] I wouldn't know.
We don't have trees like this in Sacramento.
Everything's reversed, so...
things die off in summer, turn green in winter.
Is that where you grew up?
Born there. Moved here.
My life story.
Is that long underwear?
Yes.
I almost forgot.
There's no cell service here, so...
[Aster] It's like no one can reach us here.
Ellie not here.
Oh, this is for you.
[Ellie] Taylor Swift's yacht saves the day.
-[music plays softly on radio] -You know...
I don't think I've ever hung out with a girl and not talked about boys before.
Oh.
-Sorry. -Don't be.
It's nice.
Paul's cool.
He's confusing.
It's like when I'm with him...
I feel...
I feel safe.
He's a sweet guy.
Then it's like he...
writes these things that feel...
not safe.
Not safe?
I overheard Trig talking to my dad about...
our future wedding.
I mean, he hasn't even asked me yet, but...
he's just...
so sure.
And maybe that's love.
I should marry Trig.
Oh.
Should I?
Oh, well.
God doesn't know either, if it's any consolation.
I don't believe in God.
That must be so nice.
No.
It's not.
It's...
lonely.
Yeah.
I wish I knew what I believed.
I keep asking God for a sign.
And then Paul's letter appeared in my locker.
I've...
never felt so...

No.

[in Mandarin] When Ellie's Ma died...
I fell into a dark hole.
I didn't move for days.
A few days later...
I woke to find Ellie in the booth...
manning the switch.
She looked up at me.
Just 13... an adult already.
And I...
smiled.
[in English] Have you ever loved someone so much...
you don't want anything about her...
to change?
[Pastor Shanley] Outside are the dogs, the...
-You're late. -[Pastor Shanley mutters]
I had to grind something.
And to close our Easter services...
our final reading today will be from Trig Carson.
"Love is patient.
Love is kind.
It does not envy.
It does not boast.
It is not proud."
Which is why...
I love...
this little lady.
And why she'll make me a fantastic...
wife.
Aster...
will you?
-[Ellie] No! -[crowd gasping]
I, um...
Love isn't...
It isn't--
Thank you, Ellie.
-Everyone-- -Love isn't pretending.
Uh, I know, um...
because I've been pretending.
Only for a few months, but...
it sucks.
And I've been thinking about how much it would suck to have to pretend to be...
not you...
uh... your whole life.
I always thought that there was one way to love.
Uh, one right way.
But there are more.
Uh, so many more than I knew.
And...
I never want to be the guy who stops loving someone...
for loving the way that they want to love.
And thank you, Paul.
That was...
odd.
Now, let's give Trig--
-[Ellie] I also have been pretending. -[crowd gasps]
I've been pretending that--
Don't worry, everyone, I, uh-- I think I know where this is going. Um...
Look, Ellie, I am so, so flattered, um...
-but, see, you and I are never-- -You know, Trig,
I have been writing your papers for the last four years.
And if you'll forgive me...
I'm just gonna rewrite you one last time.
Love isn't patient and kind and humble.
Love is...
Love is...
Love is messy.
And horrible and selfish and...
bold.
It's not finding your perfect half. It's...
the trying...
and...
reaching and...
failing.
Love is...
being willing to ruin your good painting...
for the chance at a great one.
Is this really the boldest stroke you can make?
You.
Yeah.
[Mr. Flores] Aster!
-[door shuts] -Everyone, please, take your seats.
-[overlapping chatter] -Everyone, take your seats.
Wait.
So I'm the good painting?
Mommy wants you to know, in case you are gay, Mommy still loves you.
-I'm not gay, Mom. -Thank God.
I might want to change our sausage recipe, though.
Are you insane? -I love that recipe! -Whatever Dad said!
Now that is some divine intervention.

Six days, 18 meals.

We didn't come here so you could be like me.
We came here so you could be like your mother.
[in English] You don't mean dead, right?

[Ellie] You haven't been to church.
[Aster] I'm busy.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You need four portfolio pieces for art school, so...
Art school?
That's great.
Yeah, well, nothing's great yet,
but we'll see.
What's going on with you?
Well...
I'm headed east to Grinnell.
-I'm leaving tomorrow-- -That's great, Ellie. Take care.
Aster!
I'm sorry.
It was just...
supposed to be one letter.
I never meant to hurt you.
Deep down, I probably knew the truth.
You really didn't use enough emojis in his texts.
I don't know what they mean.
A puppy or...
-a sausage-- -I should have sent you a sausage emoji?
Fair point.
For what it's worth...
it's not like the thought never crossed my mind.
You know...

Or I was different.
You could never be different.
"Am I sure I'm different?
-How do I know I'm sure?" -Hey, I can be sure.
"I mean, what does God think?"
