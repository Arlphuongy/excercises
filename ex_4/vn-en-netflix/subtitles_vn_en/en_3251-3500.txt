PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE
WE DEMAND JUSTICE MEXICO KILLS WOMEN
TOUCH ONE WOMAN AND WE ALL SPEAK OUT RAPISTS
RAPISTS
Come on. They're letting us in through another door.
Arturo Bravo Díaz and Julia Velázquez Noriega?
Name of family member?
Gertrudis Bravo Velázquez.
Okay.
Age?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
You're the ones who asked us to come here.
Yes.
If you people cared about your work
as much as you care about your phones,
this country would be very different.
Can you tell me your daughter's age?
Isn't it in her file?
It's just to ensure there aren't any errors, ma'am.
She's twenty-four.
Twenty-five.
Her birthday was yesterday.
Thank you.
Any identifying features?
A tattoo on her left forearm.
A tattoo?
Do you have a photo?
Okay.
Give me a moment.
Idiots.
What's wrong?
-It's not Ger. -You say the same thing every time.
-That's impossible. -Do you think this is fair?
They've had her file for months.
The people at the university have been keeping an eye on this.
It's not her.
-Could everyone step outside, please? -What? Why?
-The prosecutor is on his way. -Now I have to leave?
-Please wait outside, ma'am. -This way, please.
But…
I'm sorry, ma'am. We can come back in a moment.
Mr. Bravo, Mrs. Velázquez.
I'm Prosecutor Zamudio Rodríguez.
As I explained in my email, I was transferred here a few weeks ago.
I'm now in charge of investigating your daughter's case.
The third prosecutor on the case in nine months.
I just follow orders, ma'am.
It seems there was some confusion with Gertrudis's file.
We didn't have any record of such a recognizable feature.
Some confusion?
How can there be any confusion after nine months?
I'm very sorry.
You're sorry. We want to see her anyway.
-Pardon? -We want to see her.
If she's not our daughter, she's someone else's.
No, that's against protocol.
It was your damn protocol that brought us here to identify a body.
If that doesn't seem painful enough,
then answer me this.
What the fuck are you even doing here if you can't keep your files in order?
The bodies were found in a clandestine grave
and had been there for some time.
They're in an advanced stage of decomposition.
It wouldn't be appropriate to put you through…
-Hello. -Hello.
-My name is Adriana. -Hi, Adriana.
I'm Mitzy's mother.
My daughter disappeared two months ago.
WHERE ARE THEY?
One day she left our house,
and we never saw her again.
-Where did Mitzy go missing? Here? -Yes.
But we were told it was likely she was taken somewhere else.
Thanks, Adriana.
Is there anything else you'd like to share?
Yes.
Mitzy has a sister.
Adela.
They're twins.
Identical twins.
Adela is 16 weeks pregnant.
And although I've bought clothes and toys for the baby,
the truth is, I feel…
strange.
I can't help feeling I should be a little more…
excited, you know?
It's my first grandchild.
And…
I feel ashamed
that my daughter can see I'm sad all the time.
She never mentions it.
But I can tell she's hurting.
And…
I'd like to be able to talk to her.
To explain.
But I also feel like she's getting tired of me
always going on about the same thing.
And…
I'd also like her to know that…
of course I'm happy.
It's my first grandchild.
But I also want her to know…
every time I see her bump,
it's her sister I think about.
That's why I get sad.
And then I tell myself
that I will find her,
and she'll have lots of children.
Well, if she wants to.
If she doesn't want to, she doesn't have to have any.
The truth is…
I do feel happy sometimes.
But…
half-heartedly.
Hi, Adriana.
-Hi. -I'm Paula.
I've been searching for my mother, Agustina, for seven years.
I think you will feel happy when you see your grandchild.
Truly happy.
That baby will give you another reason to keep fighting with us.
Because that's what babies do.
You're not alone.
-You're not alone. -You're not alone.
Welcome, Adriana.
Just to remind you, we're joined today by journalist Abril Escobedo.
-Some of you know her already. -Hi, Abril.
She'll be taking notes for her investigation.
-Welcome, Abril. -Welcome.
Now we're going to hear from someone
who has come here before, but we haven't seen for a while. Today is an important day for her.
-Welcome. -Welcome, Julia.
Thank you.
I'm Julia.
Ger's mother.
Gertrudis.
And, yes, today's an important day because it's exactly nine months since she disappeared.
Remind us, Julia.
What was the last you heard of her?
Ger had just finished her training. She's a psychologist.
She wants to work with children who have difficulty
with reading and writing.
To celebrate, she took a trip with some friends.
And…
I've gone through the official process.
We've…
done everything the police asked.
We spent weeks
in the area where she went missing,
until we got tired of hitting dead ends.
So with her birthday coming around,
it feels like being hit by a train.
Everything hurts.
Then there's Arturo,
Ger's father.
He keeps offering to help take care of everything.
He doesn't understand that's not what I want.
It pisses me off.
It pisses me off that he's so nice.
I don't want him to be nice.
What I want is to know…
where my daughter is.
I understand that it's his way of being there for me.
I'm grateful that
he's looking after me,
but I need him to understand
that it isn't what Ger needs.
I miss her so much.
Today, it's nine months
since she disappeared.
Ger was happy.
And now I don't know where she is.
You're not alone.
Look where I just took a dip,
while you're stuck in the city with all that traffic and pollution.
Here's one.
-There's the other. -Hi.
That's all, Mom. I love you. See you soon.
And relax.
My brother said you're giving the gallery a hard time.
What's that?
It's embroidery.
No, don't worry.
That's my daughter. Do you like it?
Hold on a second. Let me check.
Excuse me. Are you Julia?
-Yes. -This is Emilia, my daughter.
Nice to meet you, Emilia.
Yes. I'll call you later, okay? Thanks.
Sorry, my babysitter canceled on me. Here.
May I?
Yes, of course.
Sorry.
That's why I brought them.
That's Ger.
Yesterday, they asked us to go and identify a body.
Sweetie, do me a favor.
Go and order me a coffee, and you can get whatever you want.
-Are you hungry? -Yes.
Excuse me.
When Ger was born,
for a long time, I kept catastrophizing.
That's what they call it, right?
When you keep imagining worst-case scenarios.
But you never really know what the worst is
until you wake up to the news that your daughter has disappeared.
DAUGHTER OF ARTIST JULIA VELÁZQUEZ DISAPPEARS WHILE ON VACATION
You're an artist?
I was.
What are you hoping for?
What do you think you should do now?
Yes?
Who is it?
Come on up.
Hi.
Have you called the gallery?
They've been trying to contact you.
I don't know how you're doing for money, but you could do with making a sale.
It doesn't have to be a new piece. You have so much in your studio.
I'm doing embroidery for myself,
not for anyone else.
What?
Wasn't it painful?
At least I felt something.
Ger designed it.
I feel lost too, Ju.
I don't recognize myself.
Whenever I try to talk about Ger…
it's like there's acid burning me up inside.
For nine months, I've been waking up every day
feeling so much pain…
that I think I'm going to die.
But I don't.
I can't stop thinking about what she might be going through.
What they might have done to her.
Today, I thought it would finally be over.
I wanted it to be her.
We have to go look for her again.
Look where I just took a dip,
while you're stuck in the city with all that traffic and pollution.
Here's one.
-There's the other. -Hi.
That's all, Mom. I love you. See you soon.
And relax. My brother said you're giving the gallery a hard time.
You're always like this before an exhibition, and it always goes well…
Ma'am.
Julia, it's Abril. I have some news.
I'm busy right now, but I'll call later and explain everything.
This way, please.
And we're back after that national premiere.
It's 9:23 a.m. on this beautiful, sunny Thursday.
Don't forget we still have some pairs of tickets for the festival…
They'll need to search you, please.
44-33-58-98.
44-33-58-98.
Turn around.
Cell phones and laptops in the box.
Go ahead. She's expecting you.
How are you, honey? Long time no see.
Cas, it's been so long.
How's your little girl? She must be getting big. She's very well, thanks.
This is Julia.
Thank you for seeing me.
Please, have a seat.
Did you bring the file?
Here it is.
In her work as a lawyer, Cas only handles cases like yours, so she has to keep moving.
Have they offered you money?
Money?
Government compensation, to get you to back off.
No, they haven't offered me money.
LOCATED
Is there anything that's not in here? Anything you're not telling me?
Any details not in the official file or that Abril hasn't told me?
Well, it's in the official file,
but they tried to use it to implicate Ger.
The security cameras in the bar show her and her friends
going into the bathroom and snorting coke.
She was carrying the baggie.
What do you think about that?
What do I think about my daughter going missing because she went partying?
Is that what you're asking?
No.
That's not what I meant. I'm sorry.
I need as much information as possible so I can work out how to help you.
What did the police say?
They kept bringing it up, like it was all that mattered.
As if it meant she wasn't worth searching for.
Did her friends see anything?
They didn't even notice. They say she was there one minute and gone the next.
I've known both of them a long time.
I believe them.
It's been very hard for them too.
Who's handling the case?
They just assigned a new-- Zamudio Rodríguez. Do you know him?
He's one of the best.
Though he's still part of the government.
Did you find all these people?
The truth is, I don't know
where to start looking.
-Yes? -Excuse me. It's time to go.
There's something important you should know.
With missing persons, the police usually only search for mass graves.
It's easier to find bodies than people who are alive.
As you know, in cases like these, time is of the essence. It's been months already.
The place your daughter went missing is near a major sex-trafficking area.
I don't like to speculate, but given her physique, it wouldn't surprise me if she'd passed through there.
They've found girls being held captive who match your daughter's description.
If you'd like, I can put you in touch with someone.
Or I can make some inquiries and get back to you in a few days.
No, I'll look for her. Tell me what to do.
I'm guessing the local police already know you. Yes.
Let them know you're back. I'll start working with the information you've given me.
Let someone know wherever you go or plan to go.
Tell me if you find anything. Be careful.
And don't use a vehicle that can be tracked.
Here.
Thank you.
Eat up.
Mom, what's going on? Where are you? Are you okay?
Everything's fine, son. Why? What do you mean, "why"?
I've been calling for days. You never answer the damn phone.
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.
I met a very good lawyer who's going to help us find your sister.
Help us how?
Julia.
Pedro.
I'm not doing anything bad.
I'm looking for your sister.
Just be careful, and tell me what you're doing, okay?
I'm always careful.
Don't do anything stupid just because you're sad.
It's easy for you to say that when you're there.
You were the ones who pressured me to come here.
I didn't even want to.
We're scared. We didn't want you to stay here.
Well, I'm scared too.
I can't just sit around the house waiting.
What the hell am I supposed to do if something happens to you?
Nothing's going to happen to me, and you don't have to do anything, son.
Don't be mad at me.
I'm not mad, Mom. I'm worried.
It feels like…
Nothing.
Nothing?
Mom.
What is it?
Ger is my sister, okay?
You're not the only one who lost her. I think about her every fucking day.
I cry every damn day because I miss her.
No matter where I am or what I'm doing, I suddenly burst into tears,
and you don't even notice. You're too wrapped up in your own pain
to see you're not the only one who lost Ger.
Pedrojos, sweetheart...
I had no idea.
Forget about it.
I don't know why I told you that.
Mom,
seriously...
let me know where you are, or I'll get on a fucking plane and come find you.
Don't worry.
I'll keep you updated.
I love you.
You too, Mom.
A lot.
Look after yourself.
Bye.
-Is that side okay? -Yeah.
Hello.
-Hello. -Can I have a hit?
Sure.
Thanks.
Can I see?
LET IT BURN
Did you do this?
Yes.
What's your name?
I'm Liz.
Julia.
You're not from here, right?
Neither are you.
No.
What about them?
Most of us are from the outskirts of the city. Why are you all here?
We're here to embosom the moms and family members inside.
You're what?
We're supporting them.
They got here yesterday. They came to meet some fucking officials,
who, after making them wait months for a meeting,
said there was a problem with their files and told them to go home.
The moms said they wouldn't move until they got answers.
Can you imagine? What would you do?
-Do you have children? -Two.
Pedro and Ger.
Ger?
Gertrudis. But she never liked having such an old-fashioned name.
She preferred "Ger."
We have the same tattoo.
It's really cool.
What are they doing?
What? You're not one of those people who defends statues, are you?
Sister, listen! This is your fight!
Yeah, it's nice and spicy.
The salsa's delicious.
BECAUSE YOU'RE YOUNG
Excuse me. Did you tell her we're waiting?
Yes, I told her.
Saturday or Sunday? Again?
I'll call you back. Yes.
MUNICIPAL POLICE
Good morning.
How's it going? Did you find anything?
Chief, this file is three years old. Isn't there anything more up to date?
My daughter went missing nine months ago.
Yes.
I know.
Can we check your morgue?
Look, I can show you the morgue, but guess what?
It hasn't been working for seven months.
I'll leave you my number. If you hear anything, please let us know.
Just because it's you,
we just found something that might interest you.
We'll be here for a few days.
Listen, the way things happen around here,
the container on the roadside that's packed full of
pretty girls
could be there a few days, or it could be gone tomorrow.
Either way, it'll be very difficult to identify the girls later on.
What are we waiting for?
Pedrojos, sweetheart.
I'm just checking in, so you don't worry.
I wanted to tell you the work with the lawyer is going well.
I also have a favor to ask.
Call your dad and tell him I said okay.
Tell him to call the gallery.
Have them sell whatever they can.
I've been trying to contact him, but you know what he's like.
Come on.
I have to withdraw some money to pay the lawyer's fees
and some expenses.
I'll explain later.
I love you, sweetheart.
Go on.
Move it. Come on.
-Get them out of the way. -Go on.
In your own time, man.
-Hurry up. -Come on.
That's more like it. Thanks.
Normally in these cases they're migrants, but since it's also a sex-trafficking route…
Hey, open it up.
No, honey. No photos.
And not a word to anyone about this. We're still waiting for the National Guard to get here.
This is a personal favor, okay?
Yes, but please don't break my camera.
Keep an eye on her.
I need that for my work.
-Delete the photos if you want, but-- -I'll be back shortly.
But you'll give it back?
It's good news that she wasn't there, right?
We want to look for her here.
I wouldn't if I were you.
What?
With what I just gave you, you can't take us where we want?
Do what you want. But I never go there.
They don't like having a woman telling them what to do.
The officer here will take you.
Hello.
To the end, then turn left.
Abril?
-Abril? -América, I'm Abril.
Did you talk to the cops?
You idiots. That fucking police chief knows everyone.
I bet she already put the word out. They'll be coming for you.
Do you know her? Have you seen her?
I don't know. I'm not sure. She looks familiar, but I'm not sure.
Look, I came because Cas asked me, but none of us should be here.
I know how it feels to have family taken, but you should go, please.
If she's not here, where would you look for her? The pastor. Go to his shelter.
-They've gone. -Who?
The police. Grab your things.
-Grab your things. Come on. -Yes.
What shelter? Who's this pastor?
I'll tell you later.
That's all, Mom. I love you. See you soon.
What's that?
And relax. My brother said…
She has beautiful eyes.
You're always like this before an exhibition, and it always goes well because you're amazing.
Why did you get involved in this if you have a daughter?
My mom asks me that all the time.
But…
You know why it is?
I do it because of my daughter.
She's the reason.
To be honest, sometimes I'm tempted
to leave it all behind and say, "It's not my problem."
Maybe write about something else. But I can't.
I can't.
My mom also says I'm naive and nothing will change.
But that's another reason I do this, for my daughter. I want her to understand that she should speak up.
I want her to understand that she should speak up.
That a lot of people need help, and we have to support each other.
But yeah, sometimes…
Sometimes I'm not around, and the truth is I do feel guilty about that.
It's here.
-Is this it? -Yes.
Come on.
Come on.
My teddy!
Listen, if you stay there, you can borrow it.
Actually, I'll tell you a story.
Once upon a time, there were three little pigs.
The three little pigs each built a house
to protect them from a big bad wolf who wanted to eat them.
The first little pig's house was built out of straw.
The second little pig's house was built out of sticks.
Ger?
JUSTICE! NOT EVEN ONE WOMAN LESS
JUAN FERNÁNDEZ MARTÍNEZ BROWN SKIN, BROWN EYES
HE NEVER CAME HOME FROM WORK HE'S 25 YEARS OLD
FERNANDA CASTRO CEBALLOS WENT MISSING ON FEBRUARY 23, 2009
HER DAUGHTER MISSES HER SO MUCH
Julia.
I couldn't find you.
Are you okay?
Cassandra said there was another way of searching.
Martita, come away from there. It might hit you.
You're new, right?
Is it that obvious?
You're nervous.
Yes.
I don't really know what's going to happen.
Do you come on many of these searches?
Nine years.
Two weeks of searching each month.
Every month?
Yes, we just wish...
there were more weeks in a month. I'm looking for José Arturo.
José Arturo was 20 and Alexis was 16.
Milynali was 13.
Aldo was 20.
They all went missing along with my brother.
August 2012.
All these years, and, well--
They all disappeared at the same time?
They were all together.
But now we're a family.
My friend Tere is looking for her daughter, Perla.
She and her husband disappeared at the same time.
Tere was left with the grandchildren. Can you imagine?
That's Yolanda.
She had triplets, and one of them disappeared.
Guillermo is the one who's missing.
He came here for Christmas from the U.S. and was never seen again.
And Carmelita.
Her son, Moisés,
went missing along with three other boys.
And Mari.
Her son, José Manuel,
went missing in 2010.
At that time,
they would recruit boys his age.
In 2009, 2010.
Back then, things were awful,
with a lot of boys going missing.
We had to learn to search for them
wherever people told us they'd seen something on the ground.
We'd be like, "Come on, girls,"
and maybe we'd find some ID or a clue.
Some clothing they might have left behind.
That's how we started to learn
how to conduct a search
and how to know,
how to tell where we might find something.
Yeah.
The authorities have never--
Over here! I found something.
-Over here! -Lalo, bring the machete.
-Alan, can you come? -Let's go.
It's important.
I'll get the ladder.
Here comes the ladder.
-Carefully. -Make sure it's steady.
We don't want anyone to fall.
I think that's okay. It's stable.
-Yes. -Good.
It's not too deep, is it?
No, it's not that deep. You can see some clothing.
-We won't need many of us. -Does it smell?
A bit, yes. Okay, I'll go down.
-If you want, I can too. -Who else?
-No problem. I'll go down. -I'd like to go down too.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
-Pass her some gloves. -Tere, get her a handkerchief.
And gloves.
Okay. I'll get them for you.
Mari, pass down some flashlights, please.
Please, climb down carefully. Make sure you don't slip.
We're going to find something down there.
There might be a bad smell.
If it gets too strong, use the handkerchief. Please don't touch anything.
If you find anything, just tell us, okay?
-Yes, okay. -We'll be looking out for you.
And, well,
Lupita said she's going down too, I think.
I'm here.
-Check that the ladder's secure. -Yeah, it's fine.
-Be careful. -I've got it.
Cover your mouth.
Did Julia go down?
Yes.
Be careful. There's a bee's nest down there.
It's small, but be careful.
Hold the ladder steady.
It feels a bit wobbly.
D AND N
Bring the flashlights. There's something here.
How many clandestine graves has your group found?
These graves are only clandestine to us.
They know where they left them. They know where they are.
-Who are "they"? Who dug these graves? -The people who needed to.
Who are you looking for, Lupita?
I'm looking for Daniel, my brother.
He went missing along with Gerardo,
Dianee's brother.
A group of criminals took them.
They demanded a ransom, which we paid,
but they still haven't released them.
Eight people were arrested.
During questioning, they said they cooked them.
What do you mean by "cook"?
They say it means they dismember the bodies,
burn them in oil drums,
and then scatter the remains.
Like you saw.
That's how we're finding them.
-Okay, girls. -I'm hungry.
This is all we have.
…because we tried to look.
In all these years, the prosecutors haven't contacted you?
-I had one response. -I mean, directly?
-We need to move this table. -Chicharrón, please.
She wants to take some to that handsome cop.
-Me? -But it's my turn!
Aren't you about to take an exam?
I'm not a very good dancer, but here goes.
Dancing barefoot! Wow.
Are you dancing?
You don't want to?
Julia, dance.
Come on!
Edith, help her loosen up.
Is she like Lupita? She only dances to ranchera music.
On your own!
No! Dance with her!
I'd fall over on my own!
-Ladies. -Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon, Lupita. -What time do you call this?
-Sorry, Lupita. -At least you're well rested.
-I had a meeting. You know how it is. -The others are over there.
-Okay. -They've been waiting two hours.
Mr. Rodríguez, can I ask you some questions? No, now's not a good time.
-Just a few minutes. -Not now. I'm sorry.
Mrs. Velázquez?
-Mr. Rodríguez. -How are you?
What are you doing here?
Fixing someone else's mistakes.
What are you doing here?
Doing someone else's job.
Excuse me.
Look at this.
It's the piece I wrote on the bodies in the truck.
It's been picked up by ten national news stations.
It's become a trending topic.
Your friend the police chief won't be too happy about this.
I know.
-Hi, sweetie. -Hi, Mom.
How are you?
-Where are you? -I'm in a lovely hotel. What about you?
-Have you had dinner yet? -Yes.
-What did you have? -Chicken and vegetables.
It was delicious.
-Do you miss me? -A lot.
I'll be back soon, and we can see each other. I miss you a lot too.
-Thanks. -Have a good day.
Anything else?
Your call has been forwarded to voicemail.
Hello?
Come on. If you know me, you know I never listen to my voicemail.
What?
Abril.
Abril.
I'm going to the bathroom.
-Good evening. We're doing some checks. -Good evening. Go ahead.
Lights, please.
ID.
Hurry up.
-What are you looking at? -Nothing.
ID.
They're noting them down.
Here he comes.
-Come with me. -You can't take me. No.
-You can't take me. This is illegal. -Move, damn it.
I'm in a network. You can't take me.
-This is illegal. -Move!
I'm in a network of journalists. If anything happens, they'll look for me.
My name is Abril Escobedo, and I'm a journalist. I'm Abril Escobedo, journalist! Help me!
-Move. -Help me! My name is Abril Escobedo.
-You can't do this! Julia! -Let's go.
You can't take me! Help me!
Help me!
Help me! My name is Abril Escobedo!
You can't take me!
-No! -Grab her!
Just grab her. Get her in the van. Quickly.
-Move it! -Help me!
Get her inside. Get in, damn it.
Let's go!
No.
Let's go!
Julia.
Julia.
Don't touch me!
-You people killed her! -Calm down.
-She'll be okay. -Get away from me!
Traitors.
You get paid to keep us safe, but you're the ones taking us.
Julia, they're asking about you.
-You have to leave. I came to find you. -Who's asking about me?
I'm looking for my daughter, and now I'm looking for my friend.
You're right. You have no reason to believe me.
But you're making a lot of people angry. You can't keep risking your life.
Please, come with me.
Come on. We don't have much time.
Quickly. We want them back alive!
What are we doing here?
We want them back alive!
We caught him a few weeks ago during an operation targeting gang leaders
in the area where Ger went missing.
He's not the main boss, but we know he operated in the bars
where your daughter was last seen. He's well-connected, and they're going to release him.
Go talk to the lady.
This is Ger.
Here she is with my son, Pedro.
And…
here she is playing basketball in high school.
She was competing in the nationals.
Did she win?
They came second.
Can I see?
What happened to her nose?
She took a ball to the face.
It was bleeding a lot.
She didn't care. She wanted to keep playing.
She should have won.
Stop looking for her.
You won't find her. Why not?
What did you do to her? Where is she?
She had some coke, but it wasn't our stuff.
Just for that?
And she was hot.
We're done. Get me out of here, or you'll be in deep shit.
Julia, are you okay? If you're stopped for any reason, give them this.
Julia?
Julia, you have to leave now.
If I hear anything about your friend, I'll let you know.
Go now. Hurry.
Please, hurry.
You need to go.
Julia.
You need to leave! Ma'am!
Get out of here!
Julia, you have to leave now.
Now. Leave now.
Stop looking for her.
You won't find her.
Let's go!
Not one woman more!
WE ARE NOT AFRAID
Not one woman more!
I EXIST BECAUSE I RESIST
Come on!
Sorry!
We want them back alive!
We want them back alive!
THEY'RE KILLING US
Not even one woman more! Not even one more murdered woman!
Not even one woman more! Not even one more murdered woman!
Not even one woman more! Not even one more harassed woman!
Why are they killing us?
We're the future of Latin America.
Let the sexist men tremble!
Latin America will be completely feminist!
Daughter, listen! This is your fight!
You're not alone!
You're not alone!
WE LOVE YOU! UNTIL WE FIND YOU
Testing, one, two, three.
Testing.
We shouldn't have to be here.
We shouldn't need to search for our loved ones
or wonder where they are
or who took them.
We shouldn't have to defend our fundamental rights.
But we're doing it. We always have done it.
We're here
because we're furious...
because of love...
because we're sick and tired.
We're here together
because animals that get preyed on
always move in herds.
And this herd is no longer afraid!
We're not afraid of wolves...
or lions...
or even the worst of predators.
Because they've already taken everything from us.
In the case of our loved ones, they even take their bodies.
They take away their name.
They reduce them to a file.
That's why we fight.
For the young ones...
for the old ones...
for the crazy ones...
for all the other ones...
and for our loved ones.
We're here to make sure they can't go to sleep!
So the eyes of our loved ones
get stuck in their memory like daggers.
So they remember their full names...
their faces...
their height...
and the place where they disappeared.
We are here
to say once again
that in Mexico,
women are killed and go missing every single day.
That those in power are complicit.
That those who stay silent are complicit.
We're not afraid!
But we are not.
We're willing to risk everything...
because every missing person is part of our own bodies.
Yes!
Let it be known that we're no longer afraid!
Let it be known that we're furious!
Justice!
On the ground!
Get back!
Go on! Quickly!
No!
Help us spread the word, please.
We're surrounded. The bastards have gotten inside.
They're rounding us up.
They waited until after dark, when the media had left.
Please! Help us!
Open the gate!
No!
Come on!
Stay united!
The oppressive state is a macho rapist!
The oppressive state is a macho rapist!
Come here. Don't be scared.
Here's your baby. It's okay. We'll protect you.
Get down on the ground!
The group Voice and Dignity for Our People, San Luis Potosí,
is made up of over 300 families searching for loved ones.
In Mexico, since the start of the so-called war on drugs,
the official number of missing persons stands at over 90,000. This is not about numbers. It's about people.
This is not about numbers. It's about people.

PIGEON EN COCOTTE
Okay?
Yes, chef.
I hope you've got it all sorted. Tonight's an important night.
A potential investor in our new restaurant is dining here.
Theo, come with me, please.
-Lai. Blackberries, beetroot. -Yes, chef.
-Lai. Blackberries, beetroot. -Yes, chef. -Melanie, pigeon. -Yes, chef.
-Svend, redwood sorrel. Let's go. -Thank you.
What's up?
We've got mail.
Should we rearrange with Zeuten?
Why would we do that? Just asking.
There's a lot at stake, you know.
We deliver tonight or lose the financing.
Tell me when he gets here.
You look nice.
Chef, can I show you something?
What is it?
I know it's not on the menu,
but I made a rosemary panna cotta.
What do you think? Any good?
This isn't a cooking club. You're wasting your time.
Finish your mise en place.
Thank you.
Behind.
Yes, chef.
Listen up, everyone. There's no room for mistakes today.
Yes, chef.
-Another sauce, two pigeons. -Thank you.
-Come on. -Yes, chef.
Where the hell's my food?
I haven't got all night. Time is money.
I haven't got all night. Time is money. -You need to remember that. -Yes. We're ready.
This is Lila. Hi, Theo.
-This place is on fire. -Should we sit down and talk?
-This place is on fire. -Should we sit down and talk? Hello. Hi. How are you? Jonas Zeuten. -And you are? -Melanie.
-And you are? -Melanie.
Melanie? Great stuff. Hello, everybody.
What's up? All good?
You look great.
It looks awesome out there.
-You had some Bauhaus thing before. -Golden age.
It was okay, but this is next level.
Right?
Theo, look at me. We need to sort something out.
Merle's describing this as an amazing adventure.
And I want in on the adventure.
Right?
-Sure. It all starts with the food. -That is so right.
So right.
What's up, man? Hi.
-Just taste the food, you fucking idiot! -Sorry.
We're working our asses off to give you an experience.
-You just swan in here-- -What's going on?
I believe I've insulted Theo Dahl.
-No. -Yeah.
-Jonas. -Theo, it's okay.
-See you. Keep up the good work. -Yes. I'm really sorry.
Fine.
Pigeon for table seven.
They left.
Take the pigeon to table seven.
-Theo. -Goddamn it!
Yes.
Have you called them?
No.
Do it.
Why?
-It says you've inherited Ristonchi. -But I don't want anything from him.
Sit down for a minute.
I spoke to Merle.
You two talk too much, Mom.
She said you lost it yesterday.
I'm just stressed out.
Because of the new restaurant?
Yes.
Let me ask you something.
What can the new restaurant do for you that the old one can't?
It's just different, Mom. This is…
This is my dream. To create a place where…
A restaurant that will completely change people's experience of food.
That will go down in history. Will that make you happy?
You don't get it.
You're just so…
-What? -You're so happy with the ordinary.
And you're exceptional.
Even exceptional people need to be happy. I am happy.
You're so angry.
Can you fix it?
Theo.
I'll stop by next week, and we'll talk about it then.
I love you.
I love you.
Where is everyone?
I sent them home. They shouldn't have to clean up my mess.
Okay.
I hear you're an idiot.
That farm or castle or villa your mom says you've inherited.
I don't want it.
Zeuten's out.
Last night cost us nine million.
That's a fact.
That castle's worth no more than five. Maybe seven at a push.
But it's enough to get the work started
and stay on schedule until we find the rest of the money.
You need to go down there. Coordinate with a lawyer and a realtor.
You'll come back with our future in your hands.
Merle, I don't want to.
No.
But it's not about you. It's for the sake of your team.
You said you'd clean up your own mess.
LAWYER
LAWYER CONTI
Shit.
Hi. You've reached Pino Conti. I can't take your call right now.
Please try again later. Thank you.
Back up. RISTONCHI CASTLE
RISTONCHI CASTLE
Always on my own.
I don't believe it.
-He thinks I'm giving him… Don't worry. -Calm down. Please, Sophia.
It's not a problem. I know just how to solve this.
There you go.
Thanks. You're welcome.
Here.
Buon appetito.
There you go.
Good riddance.
At least you'll leave sooner.
Well, I don't know why it's stuck.
No, not like that. You need to move this, right?
What a damn mess.
Wine?
Wine?
You speak Danish?
I understand it, but I can only speak a little.
You're doing great.
It's worthless.
It's useless.
There's nothing to build on.
I just spent three hours getting the kitchen clean enough to make a fucking sandwich.
And your sales figures…
Good night.
Sophia, can we go swimming in the pool? You know it's too dirty.
Go fetch Pino. There's a lot to do here.
Yes, sir.
Why's he tasting the food?
You can't serve this.
Then look in the garden.
You have the most amazing tomatoes and fresh ingredients. Oranges, herbs.
Your neighbor's a dairy farmer, but you buy crap at the market.
It's like café food.
If you serve this shit at a wedding, it'll be an embarrassment.
There's no electricity.
-Have you seen Pino? -No.
The idiot.
Can I help?
You're always in town.
You're always in town. Yes.
Livio.
Sophia!
Luciano, get an aged one. Thanks.
-There's no need, really. -No.
I'm so sorry,
but after this order we'll have to cancel our account.
Better days will come.
I'm not so sure.
Don't worry. There'll always be a place for you here.
Thank you.
Fantastic.
Luciano, please cut a piece for them to take home.
No, Livio, really. There's no need. I can't accept it.
It's okay. Cut some for them. That's it.
Cut some for them. That's it.
What's happening?
-What is it? -Nothing.
Why didn't you say anything?
It's a fair offer.
That's not a fair offer.
You're taking him for a ride. We're Italians. Treat him fairly.
All right.
Are you crazy? Come on.
It's a unique place. There's no finer castle than Ristonchi.
Tuscany has lots of castles. Do you have any idea how many I've seen?
It's unique. Nothing else comes close.
You spent more on your car. You have a car at home you haven't even…
Why not invest in something that makes sense, something smart? -My wife-- -What's it got to do with your wife?
-My wife-- -What's it got to do with your wife?
Prepare the paperwork. And no surprises.
Of course not. Don't worry.
Thanks, Lucca.
-Thank you. -You tricked me.
THEO DAHL WINS BOCUSE D'OR
THEO DAHL AWARDED TWO MICHELIN STARS AGAIN
Exactly one deciliter.
Thanks.
Thanks.
I really can't remember.
I don't remember much.
He made me cook a thousand eggs
when I was five or six years old.
First boiled eggs, then scrambled, and then finally poached.
Why didn't you tell me it was your wedding?
How about you let me and my restaurant cook the food for your wedding?
As a thank you for all you've done, and all the money you've spent on Ristonchi.
We go our separate ways.
No, that…
That tastes good.
Very good.
Of course.
-We'll be right back. -Bye.
Bye, Theo.
-Thanks. -You're welcome.
Yeah.
I'm getting tired.
Big day.
You ready?
I think so.
Why did you do that?
I don't know what…
Can you give us a moment?
I've only talked to Pino and Lucca about it.
It wasn't…
What are you doing here?
I brought the dream team. What the hell are you doing?
Did you get a contract out of that drunken deal?
Not now. Okay?
Theo.
Dearly beloved,
today is a day of great joy.
Sophia and Pino,
whom we have seen grow into beautiful, healthy people,
will today be united in holy matrimony.
Let us give thanks to the Lord.
Do you, Pino Conti Trevisano,
take Sophia Gennera to be your lawfully wedded wife,
in good times and in bad, until death do you part?
I do.
With all my heart.
And do you, Sophia Gennera, take Pino Conti Trevisano
take Pino Conti Trevisano to be your lawfully wedded husband,
in good times and in bad, until death do you part?
My love.
Yes, I do.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may now kiss the bride.
Hurray for the bride and groom!
Kiss!
Cheers!
Thank you.
Are you all right over here?
Come and join the rest of us.
I'm fine here.
This is a good thing, okay?
At least you're open to it now.
Remember when you and I were…
What the hell were we?
You were such a mess back then.
But you're different now.
I can see you're hurting.
That's good to see.
You're okay.
Hey. Theo, no. Don't.
How much red wine do you want?
How much more in the sauce?
It's good.
Maybe just a little bit more.
Correct it if you want.
-It's your call. -Thanks, chef.
That smells wonderful.
Looking good, Svend.
-The money from Italy cleared. -Great.
We'll go over the plans with Friis later.
You bet.
-Product delivery, Lai. -Great.
Great touch with the honey. Nice idea.
Thank you.
-I remember when that was taken. -You do?
-I remember when that was taken. -You do? Yeah.
Yes.
It was right before we left for Aarhus.
You were inseparable that whole summer.
He only managed to take a picture of your hands.
-It's still a great photo. -Yes.
That's what makes it a great photo.
Do you miss him?
I miss…
what he saw when he looked at me.
Like I was the most…
fantastic thing in the world.
You blame him.
You've always blamed him.
You're right to. He deserves the blame.
But you'd have to blame me just as much.
You know what?
You were made…
You were made in the throes of great passion.
Perhaps more than just love.
It might be terrible to hear.
No one is special.
But everyone can become a special sight…
if the right person is watching.
This looks fantastic.
The entrance there is facing this way, right?
The entrance there is facing this way, right? Yes.
You don't often see that, but I think it'll work here.
I think so too.
We just need to check for any applicable height restrictions.
We can play it safe and wait to hear from the planning office,
or we can take our chances and hope for the best.
We're not going to redesign it. Are we?
Theo?
Are you kidding me?
Go on.
What's up?
Jonas?
-The pool is ridiculous. -Maybe slightly.
But you could do some work on it. Something over there.
This has to be filled in and completely redone. -With landscaping, water. -Yes, but if you look at…
-With landscaping, water. -Yes, but if you look at…
What the hell!
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
Pino! Theo!
-Great stuff. I'm hanging up. -Fine. See you.
Another order.
Vincenzo, more Parmesan.
-I need three more, Lai. -Coming up.
Yes, please.
-That looks nice. -Yeah, it's yummy.
-It's like a good… -It's crazy.
-You've learned to drive. -Yes.
I tried calling you a couple of times.
Good. I'm proud of you.
Thank you.
Actually, you're in luck. We've got a spare single room.
It's old and dusty. We haven't been in there for a year.
Easy, I'm working on it.
Lookie here, our golden boy!
-Hi! -Show me your hands, Jiu-Jitsu.
Have you seen my nifty new jacket?
It's windproof, but the leather is breathable so you don't sweat that much.
-It's pretty sweet. -The boss is waiting.
What's up?
Boss, have you seen my new wheels? V8, 500 horses.
-Do you want to take it for a spin? -Maybe some other time.
So? Is working for me paying off?
I can't complain.
Is this my merch?
Yeah, it's for you. Why are you so twitchy, though?
Boss, if you prefer to talk, it's fine by me.
Well, in fact I do.
You know…
It seems there's a rat. In my crew.
He's going to get fucked. Do we know who it is?
Yeah. My best guy. An ambitious, smart son of a bitch.
Wears sports outfits.
But classy.
You think it's me, boss?
The pigs also like to call you Jiu-Jitsu.
We speak well of the dead, or not at all.
I prefer the latter.
-Die, pig! -Over my dead body.
You're under arrest.
I found out where you live.
You and your wife.
Karolina.
Beautiful woman.
LESSON PLAN
-Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. -Good morning.
Let's waste no time.
First off, attendance. Those who don't raise a hand are considered absent.
Paula?
Paula's here. Lyosha?
-I'm here. -He's here.
Jasiek?
Is he out again?
That's not good. Two absences in a row.
He doesn't really care anymore.
Mr. Makowiecki… Jasiek does drugs.
Dude…
And I mean… a lot.
Was he under the bridge with them?
We tried to help him somehow… Harry, Kamil and I.
-I told him how bad the shit was. -But he ended up getting totally zonked.
Nothing gets to him anymore.
His mother is calling.
Answer it, then.
Hi there, bud.
You don't call back, you don't open the door for your old friend.
I know you're at home. I heard your steps and the sound of the TV.
Okay, I know it's seems weird, but we haven't seen each other for quite a while.
Drop by for dinner, okay?
We've got a terrible mess down here.
You need to help me out with something.
But Jasiek wasn't the first victim in our school.
This is just… the tip of the iceberg.
Security constantly searches the kids. They find fentanil, desomorphine,
and… umm… some kind of speed-like designer drugs.
All of it sold by a gang.
They practically do it in the open.
You have a gang in your school?
It's just a… bunch of kids. Senior year.
Just leave it, we'll clean it up tomorrow.
I'm going to get going.
Drop by more often, will you?
I'll do my best.
The question is, who supplies it?
Because I don't believe a bunch of teens could put together such an operation.
It's not that easy. And it's not cheap.
You need money, access to a lab and you need to know the proper procedures.
Tell me one thing. Are you running the investigation?
I think I know where it is.
And when I find the stuff? I'll find out who it belongs to.
Ela is right. Just leave it to the people who know how to deal with this, okay?
But you know how to deal with stuff like this.
Are you going to help me?
Will you go there with me?
I can't. I'm busy.
Busy with what?
Drinking?
Leave it, bro. You won't change anything anyways.
How could I help you if I can't even help myself?
-Give that back. -What? This?
Take it, then.
Bad decision.
Fucker!
I told you to give it back.
Cool down a bit, boy.
Where was I….
I don't like what I'm seeing.
I just wanted to do a little shopping.
-What? -I think you've drunk enough.
But it's your liver, bro.
WAREHOUSE 30A
The police have found the body of an alleged manufacturer of fentanyl.
This highly addictive drug has, in recent months,
become a real epidemic in Polish schools.
According to unconfirmed reports, the man responsible
for manufacturing the drug committed suicide in his own lab.
Of particular interest, as our reporter found out,
the drug is manufactured by Szymon M.,
a former history teacher at Jan Sobieski High School.
It is assumed that his decision to take his own life
was caused by the recent death of his student, which…
Are you heading to Szymon M's house? Did you two know each other?
Were you aware of his criminal activity?
How did a prominent history teacher handle the fact that he poisoned…
Damian…
…and destroyed… the lives of teenagers
and… could you please comment on that?
They think that Szymon…
-that it was him…. -I know…
Isn't it cool to have a dad who's a drug dealer?
Leave him alone, man. Let go.
Damian…
-He just assaulted a police officer. -He didn't assault anybody.
He's just in shock. Leave him alone. His father's dead.
Leave him be.
The briefcase is complimentary.
It's going to work, right?
Unless someone starts picking at it.
Then it won't.
We've never met and I wasn't here.
-You're here for the job? -Yes, that's correct.
The principal will see you soon.
Do you happen to know if there are a lot of candidates?
Candidates?
Don't make me laugh. Candidates…
the very fact someone applied for the job is a miracle.
There are vacancies in other schools. Better ones.
Such a young, handsome man… Why bother?
-Are you the man? So soon? -I guess so.
-Great. Welcome. Leszek Zamoyski. -Damian Nowicki. Hello.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
Has Krysia been telling you some nice things about us?
You see… Some people like to say bad things about our school.
And I'm not saying they're wrong. There's a grain of truth in each rumor
but… let's not get carried away.
Is everything all right?
You see… It's true that we have… had…
I mean, we had problems with drugs.
But the manufacturer of this "shit", as they call it, is dead, so…
the issue is going to die down.
I've hired a security agency. Perhaps you've heard of them.
Chmielski and his crew.
The best in the business.
They were recommended to us. So… you are going to be safe here.
And here's my deputy, Agata Kierska.
The star of our mother tongue, our Polish teacher.
Or simply Agata.
Damian, hi.
Damian is going to teach history.
Oh, yeah? You've decided to come despite…? Please, don't scare him. It's water under the bridge.
When can I start?
That's the spirit, Damian.
You start tomorrow. We'll put up a new schedule.
Welcome aboard and go Hussars!
Go Hussars!
…like the other dude, huh?
Cos… I tried to call you… because I thought that…
I mean… that I can drop by?
At… your place?
You know…
for the night?
Tenner, here you go.
Put that back.
And who might you be?
The boy deserves some respect. Put that back.
Did you hear that?
Mammoth!
You want to roll with us?
Calm down! Relax! To the principal's office!
Relax! To the principal's office!
Come on!
You either put that back, or go with him.
Chmielski, you don't have a sense of humor?
-And who might you be? -Damian?
A journalist? -Hi. -Hi.
He's our new history teacher.
Hello.
Come on. I'll show you around.
It was nice meeting you, professor!
Jasiek was a really nice boy.
Apparently, he couldn't cope with his problems.
And later it turned out it was Szymon who manufactured it.
Makowiecki. The history teacher you're replacing.
You're going to teach his son, Kamil.
He's still going to be absent today.
You know, it will take some time before he is able to get back to school.
Guys, I'd like you to meet Damian Nowicki, our new history teacher.
-Edyta Mazur. -Hi.
You're a brave man, I see.
I see you like a good challenge. Witek.
Julia.
Damian, hi.
-Let's go. -Nice to meet you.
Stefan, come and meet Damian. He's taking over for Szymon.
Ho… hold it.
B… blow me.
-Wojtek! -S… sorry.
W… we'll see when I g… give you a s… surprise quiz.
G… good morning.
-See what it's like around here? -Nothing unusual here.
Well… I w… wouldn't be so sure.
Follow me, I'll show you your classroom.
Oh, I'll take everything.
Sure, watch me. What's up?
It says here that we are one of the worst high schools in Poland.
Awesome. Did you hear that? Good job!
We're maintaining our standards, right?
-You'll get it back after the lesson. -This is my phone.
I'm so sorry.
Damn, they found a substitute this fast?
Damn, they did.
My name is Damian Nowicki and I'm going to be teaching you history.
Can you hold this?
Are you a drug lord, too? Like the previous guy?
Hey, Kamil will kill you for saying stuff like that.
Hey, first of all, Makowiecki was no drug lord.
Where did you leave off with your previous teacher?
I drew you.
-Sigismund the Old. -Your dad's old.
-Which century is it? Anyone know? -16th century, sir.
Leave it! I told you I can't! We will never know.
Hello! Gentlemen? Is everything all right?
Of course, sir.
Everything's cool.
Oh, really? And what does your friend say?
What does my friend say?
Yes, everything is fine.
Frogface is my mate, we're just fooling around.
How old is your mate?
Should you be in this class?
He should be long gone.
-He dropped out three years ago. -Zip it!
I'll just sit here with you for a while.
I love history.
A touching story. Get out!
-Throw me out. -Frogface!
How many times do we have to ask?
-Frogface! -Walk him out, please.
On the double!
I don't want to see your face in here again.
Can I still drop by your place?
Check if he's got something on him and take him to the police station.
-Sure thing, boss. -See you later, professor!
You're still here?
Yes. I'm not familiar with this textbook.
I just wanted to make some notes. Before the lessons.
May I?
INTRODUCTION
THE EARLY MODERN PERIOD
And what do you think?
I mean… It's full of pictures, illustrations.
Young people like this sort of thing, so the book is pretty workable.
And how was your first day?
I heard about… your run-in with our former student.
What can I say.
Kids today don't recognize authority.
I won't bother you any longer. Have a good one.
Professor?
Are you looking for this?
Rookie mistake.
The school staff uses the underground parking lot.
It's safer down there.
Such a nice Polish teacher, alone at night? Bam!
Ms. Agata, I must admit, it wasn't very nice of you.
That's why I need to relax now. Such a pretty teacher, all alone.
Stand still!
-Help! -Shut up! I said, shut up!
Frogface!
The lady said goodbye to you earlier today, didn't she?
So? Are you going to beat me up, now? You? A measly history teacher?
In just a minute you're going to be history.
Watch out!
Now…
Fuck…
Damian!
What the hell was that?
Where did you learn to do that?
It's just my hobby.
You don't like to talk about yourself, huh?
That's enough. Thank you.
Stand in front of me.
I'll show you how to break free in a situation like that.
Okay?
How did he hold you.
Wait, like that? Grab me like this with both hands.
And now… you hit the guy in the stomach.
If that doesn't work, give him one in the face.
Hold this hand. Go down using your legs.
Great. Now twist it behind my back. Great.
And now you push…
and run. Simple enough?
-Okay… thanks. -Damian!
Is there some way I can repay you?
Can you give me a lift home? They slashed my tires.
No, please! No!
No! No!
-Shut up! -Guys! Guys, no!
No! No!
Jaro! My friend!
Don't you get it? I have nothing to live on!
What was I supposed to do?
I had some stuff left and…
"Friend"?
You're going to have to explain yourself to somebody else.
What?
Jaro! We can work this out!
Come on, stop it! No! Jaro, he's going to kill me!
Shut up!
Please! Boss, no! I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to do it! Please!
Really! Please, it'll never happen again!
I'm begging you!
You almost got busted today.
I didn't have anything on me!
I'm not that stupid! I just wanted to make some extra money! Boss, please!
It won't happen again, I promise!
Let me go! Please! Please, let me go! Boss! I'm begging you!
Please, let me go! I'm begging you!
You'll serve as an example for others.
-No! Nooo! -Let Mammoth do it!
-No! -Let him prove his worth.
Be quiet, scum!
Do it once, and do it right!
No!
Do it!
No! Leave me alone, please!
And?
-You can do it! -Mammoth!
OK, Mammoth.
-You wanna roll with us? -I do.
-Will you follow orders? -I will.
Boss, where are you taking my car?
-Hello? -Wait a minute.
To fix your tires.
-Who told you to do that? -The principal.
Thanks.
T… that was brutal!
Look! Our hero is here!
Damian…
Hello everybody…
Umm… listen, my car has been… Do you know something about it?
Don't worry about it. You'll get it back, good as new before classes are over.
It's the least I can do to thank you for saving our lovely Agata.
Something had to be done, right?
Go, hussars! Damian!
-Damian! -R… r… rewind!
You sorted them out quite easily. Who are you, anyway?
HISTORY
Yeah. P… partners!
Higher!
Jesus…
-Whoah! -You failed!
You're like Chuck Norris. Almost.
Let's get back to the Jagiellonian dynasty.
Macaque! Macaque, get back to your seat!
Could you explain this, first?
What did I tell you about cell phones in class?
Are you a murderer?
If you don't pull up your grades, I just might become one.
Could you fight in an MMA match?
Yeah. Is that some kind of karate?
How many push-ups can you do?
-Kung-fu? -Jab, jab and then hook?
Taekwondo? Aikido? Or maybe Krav maga?
A good warrior finds inspiration in all fighting styles.
He tries to match his opponent and the environment.
He's like water poured into a vessel.
-Do you know who said that? -Bruce Lee?
-Correct. -Internet!
But I mean a real fight. Okay?
I mean… a proper brawl.
And why would you want to start "a brawl"?
What do you mean "why"?
To kick the asses of the ones who have it coming.
And have you been successful? Generally speaking… I'm doing fine.
Or maybe… I'll show you.
If you win, there's no final exam.
Harry!
Are you ready? Good!
-Bring it on! -You can do it!
Come on, come on, come on! I want an A!
Here, behind you. Come on.
Are you okay?
Harry, you're slacking off!
Get him, Harry!
Come on!
Focus!
-You're a hussar! -Come on! Fight!
-Come on! -Fight!
Come on, Harry! You can do it!
-Come on, come on, come on! -It's nothing! Come on!
-Come on, come on, come on! -Do it!
Come on! Keep it up!
Come on! Now!
-Come on! -You've had enough?
Okay, get up.
He's got spirit! Good!
Add some technique and you'll be okay.
-You're going learn some history, though. -Macaque!
Kamil!
Dude, I'm impressed…
Kamil…
Kamil, they set him up. I know that.
Seriously? You came up with that all by yourself?
I want to prove it.
He asked for your help and you said "no"!
And now you're showing off?
And when my dad needed you, where were you?
-You're right. You're right. -You refused to help him!
If it weren't for you, he'd still be alive!
It's all your fault!
I know!
You think I don't go over it in my head every day!?
You're just like him, you know that?
He hated losing. Just like that.
When we played pool.
He used to get so fucking pissed, so I had to learn how to play like shit.
You know what I'm talking about.
You used to play with him.
Pathetic.
Yeah, pathetic.
We went to the Champions every week.
For over a year.
Every week he had to win.
Otherwise he wouldn't have plucked up the courage to ask the bartender out.
Until she finally agreed to go out with him.
I know how my parents met.
You see?
His tenacity made you.
And that's why he went there. To finish it.
What are you doing here, anyway?
You're no damn historian.
Well said.
But please, try not to share that information with anybody.
Why?
I want to prove his innocence.
My dad is dead. It's too late for that.
But you're alive and so are your friends.
That's why nobody can find out why I'm here, okay? Will you help me?
How can I help you if I can't even help myself?
Zamoyski made an effort, huh?
Seems like it, yeah.
So… how's your second day at work?
I heard you've gained quite a following.
Yeah. Unfortunately, they aren't so interested in history.
You'll get there, eventually.
I doubt it.
Fancy a beer? There's a bar close by.
We can check some essays. Have a chat…
-Whose essay now? -Emilia's.
She wrote about her father, who's bringing her up all by himself.
She writes:
"He helped me when I got addicted to fentanyl.
He didn't give up,
even when I cursed at him and acted horribly".
And then she talks about
how much she appreciates how hard he works for them.
What does he do?
He has a workshop.
He cuts keys, sharpens knives, repairs watches.
That kind of thing.
How's your hand?
-Fine. -Show me.
Ouch.
As they say, "it'll heal before the wedding".
Whose wedding? Are you planning to get married?
No, come on.
I'll grab us another beer, okay?
Come on, Marian!
Hey, you dykes!
Do you have a problem with the ladies?
-How about we talk this through? -What?
What's your problem, pipsqueak?
-Man, what did you have for dinner? -Tripe!
I need to lose a few pounds.
Ouch!
You want more?
Keep your hands higher.
Come on.
I told you to keep them higher.
Watch out!
Did you take all the essays with you?
Will you mark them well in your state?
Yeah, because someone
might get a B instead of a C plus.
Yeah, that would be a disaster.
But you're right. I'd better sober up a bit.
Over some tea.
Was that an invitation?
Yeah, for a cup of tea.
Want some wine?
-Yes. -I'll get some.
We're not locking the door?
What for? I'm safe with you.
I'm safe with you.
You and your wife…
Karolina.
-Ouch! Let go! -Why?
Do you know who I hang out with?
Don't mess with us!
Oh, yeah? And what do you think I'm doing now?
You don't fit in there. You've got something they lack, reason.
They're using you but if stuff goes down, they'll leave you on your own. Trust me.
-Fuck you! -I've tried to do that already.
Where do they get their stuff and who manufactures it?
Dude, don't you get it? I can't tell you anything!
Justyna, hi.
What's up?
-Nothing. Everything's okay. -Is it?
-Are you buying something? -Why do you care?
Show me your hands.
Why are you such a nag? You miss being high?
I can help you out with that. For a single smile.
Justyna…
Justyna, I'm begging you.
You'll take some drugs for a week
and then… you won't just need it, you'll want it.
And this guy? He'll become the most important person in your life.
Shut the fuck up!
Do you really want that?
Emilia… do you have a problem?
No, I'm just talkin to Justyna. Why?
Why so emotional?
Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything.
-Right, Bigos? -Yeah.
See?
You push people into addiction,
but you're saying that nobody makes anyone do anything?
Go take a run.
Take a rest.
Those are healthy choices, aren't they?
Fuck off.
Don't touch me!
-Don't touch me! You hear me? -Hey!
-Leave her alone! -Shut up!
Are you talking to me?
Little Kamil?
Don't do this. Your mum only has you left.
Who's next?
You?
Anybody else have a problem?
Come on then!
That's what I thought.
Macaque! Give me the ball!
And shut up!
I'm very sorry. He's coming this way. So…
Hi.
Did Zamoyski tell you about the new class register?
What?
That we're switching to an online version?
If you need any help, ask Witek Mróz, the computer science teacher.
He'll explain everything to you.
-Okay. -Agata!
See you around.
Are you ready for a new dose of history?
Why hasn't the whiteboard been erased?
Where's the student on duty? Where's Harry?
You're late.
Now tell me what happened.
There's nothing to talk about.
There's a lot to talk about, Harry.
Who did this?
-Kamil! -I stumbled and fell.
Stumbled into who? The gang?
Will somebody tell me what happened?
Easy for you to say but we're the ones who get beaten up.
-You outnumber them. -So what? We suck!
You do if you think so.
But let's say you're not real happy about the whole situation
and you don't want to suck anymore…
you have to stop thinking this way.
Are you a history teacher or a life coach?
They need to see that you're not afraid of them.
Now that's a great fucking piece of advice.
They're stronger.
So be smarter!
Faster.
Better prepared.
Adjust.
Like water, Harry.
-Like water he says… -Could you help us with that?
All right…
but under one condition.
Is this supposed to be your dojo?
Pretty much. Can't you see it?
We'll put training mats right here and some benches over by the wall.
And a locker room at the back. We've got everything we need.
You have quite an imagination.
Yeah, sure… and we'll start training in about two years.
No, sorry. Forgive me, guys, but that's not quite what I signed up for.
What the hell is this supposed to be?
What do you want us to do? Renovate Jarek's gang to death?
Forgive me, sir, but this is… lame.
Nobody is forcing you to be here.
The place has potential.
When do we start?
Hey! Franek!
This will be on the test!
I can see what you're doing!
-Let's get the fuck out of here! -Police!
Hey! Wait!
Girls, come on! Don't go!
We're unlucky when it comes to history teachers.
Szymon was a pain in the ass, but this guy is…
A hemorrhoid?
He's chasing off customers.
What happened to Bigos and Jock?
Nowicki learned their addresses
and called the cops when they were on a pick-up.
They'll get a lawyer and keep their mouths shut,
but we lost money.
A lot of it.
Somebody has to take care of this.
-Arigato Sensei. -Guys! Wait up!
See you later! We had a good workout.
On your toes!
Guys, wipe your shoes before you step on the mat.
Are you done with your warm-up? Can we start the training?
Fuck!
An accident in the shower?
You missed a hellova party.
But you can still drop by.
Nowicki looks pretty okay.
Unlike you guys.
He's not a regular teacher.
Nowadays, there are better ways to destroy a man.
Good morning!
What do you want?
To talk about having a watch fixed.
I can't accept this. I've got too much work.
Then people are surprised when small businesses go under.
Please, leave.
I don't want to see you around here.
You're dealers and thugs..
You're the ones who got Emilka hooked on that shit.
Oh, really?
And I thought she really just enjoyed it.
Get out! Or I'll call the cops!
Dad, wait!
Dad! Dad, please!
Wait!
Let me talk to them.
OK?
I'll wait in the back.
What do you want?
To have my watch fixed.
Can you take a look?
Here…
It used to tick… and tock…
but now it's stopped.
TO SZYMON ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 18TH BIRTHDAY
Makowiecki's watch…
Do you love your daddy?
Murderers!
Now, listen to me.
No, the leverage is pretty good. They failed to calculate the load properly.
If they took physics into consideration and measured…
-Oh, excuse me… -…they would lift it up just fine.
Oh look at you, Professor…
Damian…
Emilia has just told us that…
you've committed…
I mean…
You molested her when you were alone in that dojo of yours…
I can't wrap my head around it. What have you got to say for yourself…
Emilia…
You know you did it, don't lie…
I begged you….
But you forced your disgusting hands…
You're going to have to leave school grounds and I must suspend you.
Until the case has been sorted out.
Security will see you out.
I really don't understand it.
Hey, hey.
Kamil… Leave it!
I trusted you! I trusted you! Don't you get it?
-Just calm down. -I fucking trusted you!
And what did you do?
Come on, talk! You're really good at that!
-Good bye, professor! -Farewell! This one's for you!
Cool, huh?
I had to do it.
They showed me Makowiecki's watch.
And they threatened to kill my old man.
So… yeah.
You want to throw your life away because of me?
It's all my fault.
Give it back.
I can't.
Damian!
Emilka!
Jesus…
Get out! And leave my daughter alone!
First you try to destroy her, and now you come here to intimidate her?
-Dude, get… get out of here! -Wait…
Get out!
My dear girl…
My little girl, why?
Good day, professor.
You come here to finish the job?
Do it.
Frogface…
I've got better things to do on a Friday night.
So why did you come here?
To kiss you so you become a prince.
You worked for Chmielski. How did the drugs end up in the school?
You see how I look?
You wanna know why?
Because I wanted to sell an extra gram on the side.
A touching story.
Look.
Do you see it, or not?
The eyes of a victim.
Of a hounded animal.
Do you want to remain a victim for the rest of your life?
And you think you can change that?
How are the drugs brought into the school?
I've got news for you.
They don't get brought in.
Agata!
I've got nothing to say to you.
I know what you think about me,
-but can you just hear me out? -Do you really?
If you did, you wouldn't have come here at all.
Can you do anything else besides beat people up?
Leave, or I'll call the cops.
I know where the drugs are made.
I'm calling now.
Shitty phone!
FOOD SERVICE
Hey!
Don't move!
-We've called the cops. -Unless you like it when it hurts.
You can get used to it.
Especially when it hurts other people.
Let's see if you have the balls!
Pure crap.
Agata…
Agata…
Please, let me speak.
I took the keys. I had to. Listen to me.
The drugs are made at the school. Idziorek manufactures them.
The gang works with that… umm… catering company.
With Foodie Max? That's ridiculous.
What is this? You can't see a thing.
That's why I told you I had no hard evidence.
It's also why I came to you, not the police.
I was hoping you'd believe me.
Lemon balm tea, sir.
-Mrs. Krysia? -Yes?
Call Stefan Idziorek and… security.
I've already done that.
Mr. Nowicki here claims you work with…
this gang
to manufacture this…. fentyl stuff.
F… fentanyl.
Yeah, that's what I meant. Thank you.
He claims that he saw you… transporting… freshly-made drugs…
from the school chemistry lab to… a Foodie Max van.
I saw you there that night.
I'm talking to you.
B… because I was there.
Because I h… had to c…clean up.
Everything had to be c…cleaned up.
I helped Mr. Idziorek.
It has already been reported. At the school office.
We were there.
E… exactly.
Damian… we are all sick and tired of these drugs but…
maybe you've gotten a bit carried away.
Ma… Makowiecki…
Correct. It was Szymon Makowiecki who manufactured the drugs.
Shut the fuck up.
I know you set him up.
Strong words for a perv.
Easy! Relax! Walk him out.
I'll find my way out.
Honey…
Baby, someone wants to see you.
I'm so ashamed of myself…
You did nothing wrong.
It's Nowicki who ought to be ashamed.
You're innocent.
Aren't you?
Can you do anything besides beat people up? Leave or I'll call the police.
It's too late…
It was Szymon Makowiecki who manufactured the drugs.
He asked for your help and you refused.
If it weren't for you, he'd still be alive!
We've got a terrible mess down here. You need to help me out with something.
Damian?
I talked to Emilka.
I'm sorry.
You should be mad at me.
Maybe. Maybe I should.
What's that?
The cheapest whisky. Disgusting, isn't it?
I love it.
School surveillance?
Yeah, but it's edited.
There's nothing there.
They're good.
What was your job before you joined our school?
I was a cop.
I was working on a drug ring.
But back then I had the support of the state.
At least that's what I thought.
Some idiot failed to secure the database and they found Karolina.
My wife.
I rushed to save her but it was too late.
And the gang?
It doesn't exist anymore.
So what? If there are people like Chmielski and Idziorek?
That's why you ended up in our school?
Szymon was my friend.
I applied for the job to find out who did it and exact my revenge.
But I failed.
And after the way they fired me, nobody will ever trust me again.
They… threatened to kill my… family!
Who?
I j… just c… cook!
For who? Chmielski?
Speak.
F… for m… myself!
For m… my… Monika!
I finally had the chance to be someone!
I'll take care of that…
Mrs. Monika, I… I really don't know what to say.
It's such a horrible thing…
Stefan has worked with us for years. He was a great teacher.
He was a real chemistry enthusiast.
A teacher like him is irreplaceable.
-If there's anything I can do… -Thank you.
I think it high time… we emptied… Szymon's locker.
Despite what he did, his widow deserves some respect.
Would you be so kind and hand his things over to Ela?
-I'd be most grateful. -Of course.
Excuse me sir, you have a visitor. It's important.
Emilka, hi. How are you?
How are you feeling? Are you coming back to school?
I'd like to ask you to reinstate Mr. Nowicki.
After what he did to you?
Because I lied. Damian didn't even lay a finger on me.
-I'm sorry. -So… what was this all about?
I don't know…
They came to see my father. They threatened him.
They made me do it.
Please, sit down.
We forgot to do just one thing.
To grease the door.
Emilia told us about everything.
We fucked up big time.
Hey! This isn't a race track!
Emi!
What's wrong with her?
Internal hemorrhaging.
But fortunately, they managed to stop the bleeding.
Now she's in a postoperative coma.
It's my fault.
You can't think like that. It wasn't your fault.
-I'll kill them! I swear! -Calm down.
Stay with her, she needs you right now. I'll handle it.
Damian, we need to talk.
I didn't want them to hear it, but Kamil's right.
We need to find the drugs in the warehouse.
How are we supposed to do that?
Have you been there? The place is huge.
I know. But I've got this.
-Look. -What is it?
I found it in Szymon's locker.
To the right of the entrance, row "H". Food Max cartons.
Dairy products.
How long do we have to wait?
Oh no, please!
He's just taking a nap. What are you doing here?
I'm going with you.
I'm your supervisor. So, you have to obey my orders.
OK!
Agata!
I wouldn't do that.
Good evening, professor.
And good evening to you too, sir.
I'll have to hire a new Polish teacher.
Do you know how hard it is to find somebody to work in this school?
It's like like luring small children.
It was enough to say I had small kittens in my basement
and leave the door open.
Szymon's notepad…
What's the point?
I really used to make an effort.
This was meant to be a world-class school.
Sobieski's Hussars. Go, hussars!
Scholarships…. better staff…
And where did we end up? Fucking nowhere. Why?
Because they preferred to do drugs and fuck in the toilet stalls.
So they got the school they wanted.
After all, isn't that a success?
I will destroy you, you know that?
Oh… Szymon said the exact same thing…
-Calm down! -Leave me alone!
-Oh… here you go. -Leave it!
I even wear the souvenir he left me!
Fuck, it doesn't seem to work.
Doesn't matter. Your time has come.
No!
No!
And who the fuck are you?
Come here, russkie! Come on, come on!
How did you like that, Mammoth?
Little Mammoth. What are you looking at, huh?
I'm from Ukraine mi dorohy druzhe.
Slava Ukraini!
Gonzo! Bring him to the mirror!
This one's for Emilia, you punk.
-You hit like a girl. -You know peculiar women.
Your cable a bit too short?
Shaolin? Special forces? Where are you from?
From Rabka Zdrój.
-What? -A beautiful resort town.
Kamil!
He looks a bit shocked.
Damian, you still don't get it, do you?
The girl is in a coma because of you!
Idziorek's death is also on you.
You want her to be your next victim? Move back!
To think I really grew fond of you the moment I hired you.
I thought I was the only candidate.
Yeah, that too.
Did I do well? Did you see that?
You're too small for me!
Understand?
You're nothing to me!
-Fuck you! -Come here!
Move it!
-What now? -I don't know.
Get off me!
-Stop twitching! -Okay, okay, okay.
-Bro, you really beat up Tytus! -Stop talking!
Yeah, you too. You and the girls were really at their throats.
He deserved it.
If it weren't for you…
I think he would have wanted you to have it.
