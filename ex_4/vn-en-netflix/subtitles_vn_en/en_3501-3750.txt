[in English] Guys? Is anyone working in the vault tonight?
Shit.
Hello? Hello?
Hey, guys. It's not funny.
If you idiots think you're gonna scare me today, it's not going to happen.
Hello? Who's there?
[with Russian accent] Happy birthday, George.
Are you coming?
Yes, madam!
Thank you, boys. Thank you, bra God. Oh, Georgie…
[George] So, what's your name?
You know, we should not be in here.
I mean, we can do this in the office. Not that I'm complaining.
It's just that this room gets a little bit cold, you know, and makes other things smaller.
[man] Okay, Chen. Listen to me. All right? As I mentioned before,
even if I were with sales, there's nothing I can do. You've got to be on the list.
Come on, Sam. Don't give me that shit. I only need a few liters.
Nobody needs to know.
It's not the amount that's the problem, it's…
What do you want it for, anyway?
What… What do I want it for?
[sighs] We're….
developing medical equipment to help children with cancer? You like children, don't you?
Yeah, of course. Of course I like children.
But that's not the point.
Look, Sam,
I'm willing to pay very good money, all right?
The kind that will bring all the girls to your yard.
You understand?
Uh, I understand,
I understand, but, uh… [chuckles] I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.
All right? I can't help you. Bye-bye.
Got to go. Got to… go.
[Sam] So, why am I getting calls from Chinese gangsters at eight in the morning?
Well, that's because we mine the only Zulcanoid deposit on Earth.
And right now, Zulcanoid is on fire.
It's basically a liquid metal similar to mercury.
Except it won't poison you or make you want to eat your own face.
And that makes it valuable. Only problem is, we can't keep up with demand.
Which hasn't always been the case. Believe me.
But after struggling for so many years, it feels like we've finally arrived.
At last, things are falling into place.
We're screwed, man.
I can't believe it. This is the end.
I can't believe it. This is the end. It's way too early in the morning for this.
Take a breath, Liam. What's going on?
Ah. Of course, of course. You haven't heard. You were at the mine.
Heard what, Liam?
Bheki's stepping down.
It's the whole thing with his lungs.
Melusi's taking over.
My God.
No, Sam. God has forsaken us.
And the devil's called a management meeting you gotta be at now. What?
-Yeah! Hustle, hustle, hustle. -Okay.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please. Um…
-Sorry. I should've sat in the front. -[people muttering]
Okay. Yeah, uh…
Whoa. Whoa!
Please stop! Wait. Wait. Wait!
[Junior] If you think that's just bad luck, you've got no idea.
The truth is, I'm cursed. My whole family is.
It began when my parents met. It was your classic love story,
Dad stole Mom's heart.
Then six months later, he stole the rest of her shit.
Shit!
He never came back after that.
While on a job one night, he got himself into a bit of a situation.
He probably would've gotten away with it if it wasn't for one small piece of bad luck.
[Junior] Because the universe has a sense of humor,
I work as a security guard. Which, I suppose, could be worse.
Like the rest of my life in which I'm permanently broke, haven't had a girlfriend in five years,
and am forced to live with two of the world's most annoying roommates.
-Bingo. -Oh, yum…
We really shouldn't.
I suppose he didn't say we couldn't look.
He didn't say that.
Exactly.
[Junior] Seriously?
Junior, what are you doing?
What's that? Morning, boss. Sorry. That's not mine.
Uh, my housemates stole my lunch.
-I don't want to hear it. -Right.
HR's presenting this morning, and we are all under the microscope.
Yes, sir.
Put on a jacket. It looks like you slept in that shirt.
Uh, sorry. About that, sir. There was an… incident this morning.
My jacket kind of… [clears throat]
…got away from me.
All right, let me get this straight.
-You are a security guard… -Yes, sir.
…and both your jacket and your lunch got stolen this morning?
When you say it like that, doesn't sound great. Enough! Get your…
Enough! Get your…
Get your shit together!
Yes, sir. Sorry. I will.
Since you hate your roommates so much, why don't you just move out?
Well, I would if I could, but… I signed the lease.
Then put them in their place, Junior. Show them who they're dealing with.
Yeah! Yeah. [laughs] Absolutely.
Let them know who they're dealing with.
I'm gonna do that… tonight.
They're gonna feel… thunder.
Okay. Good. Good.
I will see you in the meeting.
Yes, right. The meeting. I'll be there.
"Feel the thunder." [laughs]
I'm amazed she didn't have sex with you right now.
Okay, thank you. Shut up, please.
Dude, look, just ask her out and stop being a pussy.
-I'm not being a pussy. -You're a pussy.
-I'm not! Can you stop? -Pussy.
-Stop that. Please. Just this once. -Whatever.
Why is HR coming to the meeting? I don't know. Maybe we're getting a raise?
Really?
It's like we've never met.
Oh shit.
Hey, Sean. How're you doing?
Fine, thanks. I'm just busy urinating.
Yeah. Yeah, I see that.
I saw Colleen earlier on who said, "Hey, where's Prince?"
And then I said, "Well, you know Prince. He's probably late again."
And I was right.
Yeah.
Mm! You want me to go tell her that you've arrived? I can make that happen.
No. I've got it.
Listen, also, don't you want to maybe just put it away?
No one wants to see that.
You know, I always used to be late for things, Prince.
Really? Yeah, and what did you do?
I just arrived earlier. That's the secret.
-Oh? It's a secret? -Yup.
[softly] Thanks for sharing.
Have a good day at work.
[Prince] So, why am I always late for work?
Well, it's not exactly a mystery.
I hate my job.
But I don't have a choice.
According to the rules of my trust fund, I have to work as an accountant for five years
or else I'm cut off.
Thank God I'm almost there. And then I'll get to prove my father wrong.
Hey.
Colleen? Hey. Good morning.
How long you been in here?
Uh, I don't know. Like a few minutes, give or take.
Yeah, is there anything I can help with? It's too late. I sorted it out myself. As usual.
Oh, okay.
Are you almost done in here?
You know we've got a meeting, right?
Yeah. I will be there or be squared. I'm so sorry.
There is just something about you that gets right up my ass.
I think I'm gonna call in HR
so we can have another little heart-to-heart.
Oh? Is that right?
You think we need to have a little chat with HR, do you?
How's this for a heart-to-heart?
[Prince] What do you have to say now, Colleen?
Huh?
You know, I'm actually surprised you have a heart!
Fucking…
What the hell are you doing? Oh, um, nothing. Nothing. I'm so sorry.
There is a spasm in my hand from all the work I've been doing.
I said I want you to take notes
for our department in the meeting.
You think you can handle that?
Yeah, we got this. I… I got this. Um, anything you say, boss.
Good.
Was that you?
-What? -Are you the office pisser?
No.
Of course you are.
I should've thought as much. Clean that up or I'll give you another warning.
Yeah, but I didn't do it. Then who was it, huh?
Thought so.
Sort it out.
You're disgusting.
Why didn't you say something? Come on, man.
You know what? You deserve this.
Oh, fuck.
My father started this business with nothing.
All he had was some dusty ground…
a few millions,
and a vision.
Nice for you to join us, Sam.
Alas, even visionaries have blind spots.
This is why we're here.
We are here to change your slow thinking.
We are here to put spectacles on your eyes so you can see brighter.
This is why we're here. We're here to open your eyes. Gugu.
What do we have here?
Tell me what you see. Don't be scared.
This is a free and safe space.
No.
Speak!
Don't do it.
Yeah, you! Go.
Good morning, everyone. Morning.
Well, what I see is… you know, uh…
it looks like, um…
uh, an office, sir.
Excuse me?
Well, I mean, um, from where I'm standing it kind of, uh…
resembles, uh… um… somebody's, uh, you know, uh… office.
Turn around. Sir? What?
I don't want to look at your ugly face. Turn around.
-Don't even sit down. Just turn around. -Okay.
What we have here is a cancer that's in this business.
Starting from today, all you managers are going to pay rent.
You like nice things? Huh?
Well, you must pay for that. No more free lunches!
Free lunches for everyone!
Yay! Woo-hoo! [laughs]
Now that sounds great. There'll be a catch. Trust me.
It does depend whether or not there's been a client meeting earlier on in the week and…
well, whether there's leftovers.
[chuckles] Obviously.
Let's look alive. Look alive. Come on.
I'm so sorry.
[woman] A little help here.
Sure.
-Thank you. It's a little heavy. -[chuckles]
[sighs] Well, when times get tough, what do we do?
We tighten our belts!
So, as of this week,
you'll all be handing in your laptops in exchange for these retro babies!
Hey? Pretty cool.
You… You can't be serious.
This is a joke, right? [laughs]
If a company surviving in this economy is a joke to you, Prince, then yes, this is a very big joke.
then yes, this is a very big joke. Why don't you write that down?
Now, who can tell me here
how many minutes are there in one hour?
How? A room full of managers,
leaders of this business, no one can answer such a simple question?
Go.
Well, I mean, it's one hour, so…
Sixty minutes.
Lower your chair.
I'm sorry?
I said lower your chair. You don't deserve to sit in a big chair. Lower your chair. Now. Now.
Lower your chair. Now. Now.
No one in this room has a vision. No one.
I'm the only person in this room that has a vision.
Gugu.
Starting from today,
I'm going to introduce a visionary concept
called "AMI Time".
AMI Time is one government hour
plus a 30 minutes bonus.
-[Junior] This is what I told you about… -[murmuring]
Quieten down, everyone. Uh, quiet, please.
I would like you all to meet Brian.
Come here, Brian. Come along.
That's my jacket. What?
-Dude's wearing my jacket. -Yeah?
[straining] We found Brian on the side of the road this morning.
We… [wheezes]
We actually thought he was dead. [laughs]
But the fact is,
he would still be able to do most of your jobs.
The Finance department is not really the most popular department.
It turns out 86% of your colleagues don't even remember a single one of your names.
Which is why we've come up with these.
Thank you, Colleen.
Name tags. Look at them.
Okay, they're quite visible.
But maybe it's also about the placement of your name tag.
You can put it right in the middle.
Or on this side. Or perhaps on that side.
Also, try giving yourself a fun nickname.
So that people find you relatable.
Yes?
Um, people like to call me "Knobface." I'm not exactly sure why.
I know why.
So let's not go with that here. Okay?
Can I use your name, please?
No. No, no, no.
We want your colleagues to get to know you. To find you exciting.
What's your name?
[whispering] Sean. Sean…
Sean. Sean.
Carol.
Oh my shit, someone kill me now.
Do you know how long our waiting list is right now?
Five months.
Five months! We are losing sales because we can't keep up with the demand.
Luckily, I… I have a solution.
From now on, every unit we sell
will have 50% Zulcanoid and 50% cutting agent.
See? Genius.
Okay, I'm sorry. [scoffs]
Is that paint?
I said it's "cutting agent".
Okay, well, you can't do that. And why not?
The paint will contaminate the Zulcanoid, making it unstable.
And how do you know that?
Basic chemistry.
Basic chemistry? Maybe I wouldn't need to do this if you found us more ground.
We're mining the only known Zulcanoid deposit on Earth. [scoffs]
It's not exactly easy to find. [laughs]
Do you know what is easy to find, Sam?
What's that?
Geologists.
Which is why the company has decided you will no longer be getting your annual bonus.
-What? -[all grumbling]
Shh. No. Hold on. Let me finish.
It's not all bad news.
Instead of… money,
which, let's be frank, most of you would just tk-tk-tk away anyway,
the company has decided to give you this amazing company-branded clothing.
I mean, take a look at this!
The survey also indicates that your colleagues don't like the way you treat them.
They say you are, open quote, "sub-human", close quotes.
I know why. Because you spend all day on spreadsheets. Maybe all night.
Who can tell me, what is the most important thing in any business?
Yes.
Sharp pencils.
Do you use sharp pencils in your everyday job?
No.
Then why would you think they're most important?
Because the Russians use them in space.
Are you in space right now? Yes. The work space.
Anyone else?
Anyone else?
Anyone else, please? Anyone else, please?
Yes.
-What about pens? -Damn it!
Customers!
The customer is the lifeblood of any company. Okay?
You don't know that because you don't get to see the customer.
We are changing that today. You will all have your own personalized customer
that you will take with you everywhere you go.
You will take your customer to the kitchen. You will take your customer to the toilet.
You will take your customer with you. Are we clear?
Uh, sorry. Uh, Carol. I am not taking a sex toy to the toilet.
It is not a sex toy! It is a customer. You will take the customer with you to the toilet. Every time!
-Do you understand? -Yes, yes. Okay, I understand.
Wow!
[Carol] And, unfortunately, we do not have pumps. So you're going to have to blow your customer yourself.
Just be careful where you put your mouth. It can be very confusing.
[Prince] You know what I don't get? Why'd he leave Melusi in charge?
Come on, dude. It's his son. What else was he supposed to do?
He could've given it to Sam. Shit, I'd even do a better job.
You're a junior accountant carrying a sex doll around.
-I don't think you've got what it takes. -You think you do?
-You don't even balls to ask Portia out. -Whoa.
-I think I know what he's doing. -Who?
Melusi. He's cutting costs.
Trying to make it look like AMI is more profitable than what it is.
Why would he do that?
To jack up the price. Right?
You think he wants to sell the company?
There's only one way to find out.
I'll ask him.
-Ask him? -Yeah.
You do realize he hates you, right? Like, on a biblical level.
It doesn't matter.
I just have to figure out what buttons to push.
Okay, well, just don't push the button that says, "Punch Sam in the Head."
"Punch Sam in the Head." Because you will lose that fight. Badly.
It'd be like a rhino stomping on a frog.
Except the frog's already, like, diabetic and shit.
Like, in a wheelchair, and it can't even hop--
I get it. I get it.
-Oh! Hello, Sam. -Hey, Gugu.
How are you?
Hey, I'm fine. Thank you. Uh, you've got a…
-Uh, oh. [sniffs] Oh, thanks! -You got a… Yeah.
It's, uh… medical powder for my allergies.
Yeah, that's not what I was talking about. Uh, never mind.
Is he available?
Oh, he's about to pop out.
Pop out? [chuckles]
All right, well I'm just going to grab it. Grab him! Grab him. Excuse me.
Okay…
Oh jeez. [scoffs]
Hey. Hey!
I need to talk to you.
I didn't realize that you're the one in charge now. Huh? So what can I do for you, boss?
Look, you've been here for what? A couple of months?
I've been here since day one.
I just need to know whether you're going to sell the company.
Who told you that?
You did, actually.
I mean, you've been cutting corners everywhere.
-It's pretty obvious. -[chuckles]
Look at that, huh? Miner boy! Now you think you understand business.
If you sell to another mining company our people will lose their jobs.
-They helped build this place. You can't-- -Hey! Hey! Hey!
I'm the one who's in charge here.
Me! I'll do whatever I like here.
If you had a little bit more respect for your father and what he's done here, you--
My father? My father? Who are you to talk to me about my father?
Get out. Get out!
Nonsense.
-Hey. -Hey.
How bad is it?
Seven. Maybe eight. Not that she'll admit it.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
-Where is she? -In her room.
-All right. -I'll warm your food.
Thank you.
-[knocking] -Hey, Princess.
Dad, I'm 15. You've gotta stop calling me that. I know. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. How're you doing?
Are you… are you in any pain?
As I told Mom, I'm fine. I can barely feel it.
Okay.
Well, uh, do you mind if I take a look?
That's, uh… That's not that bad. Right?
-See? -Yeah.
I mean, the way your mom was going on on the phone, you'd swear it was a seven… or an eight.
It's nowhere near an eight. It's like a four.
Right.
Well, if I knew that, I would've stopped off at the bar,
picked up a couple shotskis.
You? Shots?
Hey. There's a lot about me you don't know. Okay?
I am capable of stuff.
-Really? -Girl…
Want me to call your mom? To…
Seriously? I don't need help putting on cream. I'm not a little girl anymore.
Dad?
Mm! Right. Right. I'm cramping your style.
Well, uh… I'll let you get to it, then.
-Hey, Dad? -Yeah? Yeah?
I love you. I love you too, Princess.
How was work?
Started badly. Went downhill from there.
You know, pretty standard.
I suppose it's my fault?
What are you talking about?
You've been spoiled your whole life. Now you can't face having to work for a living.
It's not working I have a problem with.
It's being an accountant.
You know, I don't get it. What's so wrong with being a paramedic?
You don't have the stomach to work on the front line.
You're a coward.
Always have been.
I… I was a nervous kid.
Yes, I'll give you that. But… [clears throat] I'm not that kid anymore.
Yes, you are.
You're weak. Just like your mother.
You know what?
That's enough, Dad.
Would a coward do this?
Something you want to say to me, boy?
No. No, um…
There's no point.
Good night. -[tense music playing] -[thunder rumbling]
[Junior] Guys, could you take that shit off?
[Junior] Okay, look. I don't ask for a lot around here.
Just please leave my shit alone.
Well, just so you know. We're not proud of what happened.
Won't happen again.
If it makes you feel better, we didn't enjoy the food.
No, not at all.
[man] It was horrible.
Like dog food. If you hated your dog.
You should totally take some cooking lessons.
Oh, that's a good idea.
Okay. I'm sorry that my cooking isn't up to your standards. Mm…
-But you need to make your own food. -[both chuckle]
Ah, if only it were that easy.
What do you mean?
We are exceptionally busy during the day. You're both unemployed.
That is not true.
-And not fair. -And you know it.
I'll have you know that we do a lot around here.
Like?
Well, for starters, uh, meditating.
Every morning we make sure that there is clean energy in all the rooms.
All the rooms. All the rooms.
[man on recording] Take your next breath,
sending it into your lower back and belly.
Releasing any tension that you may be holding in these areas.
Are you telling me that the two of you have been naked in my room?
That's not the point. The point is that we do more than our fair share.
Way more.
Okay. Um…
Name one other thing.
One actual thing.
DIY.
DIY.
When things go wrong around here, who sorts it out?
Not you, that's for sure. You're never here. You come and go as you please.
That's because I have a job!
Let's watch the tone of voice. Bring it down.
Yeah. Relax.
You know what?
I've literally never seen you guys fix a single thing around here.
Uh, who do you think fixed the burst pipe in the bathroom this very morning? Hmm?
[exhales] There's a burst pipe in the bathroom? Mm-hmm.
How did that happen?
No idea.
Megan. Megan!
[Sam] Maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe with the right buyer, things won't be so bad.
We could increase production, improve R&D, move into new markets.
What if I've been thinking about this all wrong?
This could be exactly what the company needs.
Okay, you know what?
Enough.
Close your eyes.
Get some sleep.
Shit.
What is it?
Huh?
What is it?
Nothing. Just a meeting. Go back to sleep now.
So they found a buyer? That's got to be it. It's pretty obvious.
Which means a bunch of us are about to lose our jobs. We don't know that. Let's not panic, all right?
We don't know that. Let's not panic, all right?
I'm weeks away from hitting my five years.
-If they cut me now, I am screwed. -[sniffing]
[scoffs] If they cut me now,
I'm pretty much homeless.
That's me.
Look, let's just calm down, keep an open mind. All right?
You never know. This could be a good thing.
[Melusi on video] Recently, our company was dying.
-A heavy darkness had befallen us. -[inspirational music playing]
But then a new leader was chosen.
-And a bright new day dawned for AMI. -[inspirational music builds]
A man not afraid to think outside the box,
to do away with wasteful things,
to make AMI stronger, safer, more efficient.
A man who even changed time!
-[eagle screeches] -And why has he done all these things?
Because he cares about the future.
And that future starts today!
Yes, yes, yes.
When I became your leader,
I could see that there was a lot of doubt in your eyes.
You were thinking, "Can this young bull really provide for our future?"
Well, I have an answer for you today.
All the way from overseas!
-Your new leaders of AMI! -[dance music resumes]
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes!
-[loud pop] -Yeah!
[man] Howdy!
Come talk to your people. Talk to your people.
[with Australian accent] Well, hello, AMI.
Yeah, hello.
I can't tell you how excited we all are
to finally see you all in the flesh!
Yeah! The fleshy flesh!
Now, before we go any further,
I want to make one thing very clear.
And that is that we are not planning on making any major changes.
No job cuts. No demotions. No downsizing of any sort.
You can all rest easy.
Can I get a bloody "Hallelujah?"
-Yeah! -Yes!
We will worry about all of that shit next month!
That's it. I'm homeless.
So now, as you know, Melusi is going to be stepping out, and I'm going to be stepping in.
Badrick over here is going to be my second-in-command.
And the beautiful Anya will be our new Change Manager.
Even though, like I've just said, you've got nothing to worry about at all.
For now.
Now, this is usually the time, I suppose, when your new leader,
your new chief, bores you to death with his galaxy of achievements.
But instead I'm going to open the floor to my lovely colleagues
to have a word with you beautiful people. I think Badrick, you first.
Uh, spoiler warning,
he's a bit intense.
[with Jamaican accent] There are three things you need to know about me.
One, I don't take shit from nobody!
And two, you romp wid mi, and I'm gonna mash you up!
Three, no matter what…
I always come out on top.
And if you leave me stranded on Jamrock with no food… everything irie.
Because Badrick will feast on himself.
I'm sorry. Did he just say he'd eat himself?
[man] Thank you, Baddy!
Yeah, Badrick, ladies and gentlemen. But he has a heart of gold.
Yeah, he can light up the darkest room.
No, really. Yeah. All right, thanks, Baddy.
Next up we have the lovely Anya.
[with Russian accent] So. What is change?
Put your hand down.
Is change when we birth
small uterus, slimy lizard
into baby?
Who knows?
Because change is very mysterious. Hmm?
Thank you.
Anya, thank you so much. You really raise a valid point there.
Change, guys, is so… mysterious.
All right, that's it. Let's all get back to work.
We need more of that Zulcanoid.
That's a bloody order!
Just playing, silly buggers!
Oh, yeah. Gotcha.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But seriously, let's go. Come on.
Yeah! Let's go!
-Yeah. Yeah. -[Anya] Bye-bye.
[boss] There's some jelly in the canteen. Come on.
-[man laughing] -What the hell was that?
Still think this is a good idea?
[Sam] However bad we thought it was going to be, we were wrong.
Way wrong.
-Hey. -Hey.
Based on some budgetary challenges,
we will no longer be issuing you with any weapons.
Instead, we will provide you with something far more valuable.
The ability to fight off intruders
by only using your instincts, your training,
and some basic office supplies.
So our special guest today is Sensei Storm Force.
The inventor of the world's most mixed martial art,
KMKJ.
Or rather "Krav Maga Karate Jujutsu.".
Sensei.
Krav Maga Karate Jujutsu is all about flow.
About using the tools around you to shift energy. And to attack!
Now… is this a stapler or…
jaws of death?
I'm pretty sure that's just a stapler.
Yeah, it's a stapler. Ah, this guy.
We don't need Krav Maga Jujutsu Karate.
Just be awake. And focus. Foo!
Shut it!
Reading is not really my thing.
-Just give it to me straight. -[Colleen] Well, he's always late.
He lies all the time. He has a terrible attitude.
Basically, he's the worst staff member we've ever had.
So if him that bad, why him still here? Why you don't get rid of him?
I wish we could. Believe me. But his father is one of our biggest clients,
and I really don't want to rock that boat.
So what you want to do?
I mean… I could work him over.
Break a few bones.
Slice off some skin.
You… you can do that?
Yeah, man.
That is very tempting, but…
But I actually had a slightly different idea.
Hmm. Okay. Tell me about it.
Well, I thought that we could, uh… move him.
You know? Give him the kind of soul-crushing job
that just completely destroys him. You know?
Make his days just slow, painful, psychological torture.
Yeah! Yeah, man.
Do what you want. Me don't give a shit.
Whoa! Me give a shit!
I give a shit!
Also, you were joking about the slicing thing, right?
And just to clarify,
what did you mean about torture?
-Where is he? -I'm sorry, what?
Gregory. Where's Gregory?
-Right over here. -Right over there.
Hello, mate.
You can't cancel the medical aid. People rely on that. I rely on that!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Steady there, sailor. Batten that hatch.
Okay, so now, it's, uh…
Wait a minute, don't tell me.
Sam.
Sam! Sammy! Yeah, Sammy. Okay.
So, let's start that over, but maybe this time, without the death stare. Okay?
So, what's the big emergency?
My daughter is on some very expensive medication that I can't afford without the medical aid. Okay?
-Oh… -Gotcha! Okay. Yeah.
All right. But I'm afraid we don't really have a choice.
It was a part of our agreement with your former leader. So…
So… change the deal.
Well, now wait a minute. Wait a bloody minute.
Oh, I've just been reading up on natural therapies.
Yeah? And did you know it is incredible
what you can make just by boiling a few plants together.
Did you know that? It is crazy!
And, you want to know something else?
You can probably find everything that you need in your own forest.
[laughs] Oh yeah!
Now I'd say that's a win.
No. No, no, no!
These are sophisticated drugs! Okay?
You can't just make them with fucking plants!
Boil.
You gotta boil them.
Now, before I can teach you anything, I need to know exactly what I am dealing with.
Any volunteers?
Thank you. Thank you, sir.
-What's your name? -Sorry, no. I wasn't volunteering.
-He was being a dick. -[manager] His name's Junior.
And he will be volunteering. Won't he?
Yes. Lovely. -[clapping] -[cheering]
[Storm Force] Come on. Don't be shy. Please come forward.
Oh, Prince, Prince, Princey Prince, Prince.
This is long overdue. You realize it's all your fault?
What is this?
That is a schedule, Einstein.
Yeah, but for what?
For the toilet.
Since you love them so much,
you are going to be timing people.
Uh, I'm sorry? Timing people in the toilet?
Exactly.
Do you have any idea how much productivity is lost when people go for a loo break?
Please. Please. I'm begging. Don't do this.
I'm sorry? Are you too good for this job? No! No, no, no, it's not that. It's just that, um…
I'm still part of the Finance department, right?
No, of course not! Now you're part of Facilities,
but your time sheets still come to me, so do not fuck them up!
Okay, look. I don't care. I'll do the job. If you take me out of the Finance department, I will…
I will lose my entire trust fund.
What?
Yeah.
-Your entire trust fund? -All of it!
I had no idea. Yeah, it's pretty stupid if you ask me.
Your entire trust fund? That's amazing.
You made my day.
Oh, shit.
So… do I stay here?
[Anya] Do not be stressed.
I think you are experiencing some change. So why don't you sit down,
and we can talk about how you feel? Okay?
How I feel? Is she being--
Are you being for real, right now?
We are talking about my daughter's life here!
Yeah, we know because you already told us.
[laughing] You bloody bugger! He's trying to fool us!
All right. [scoffs]
Clearly, you guys think that this is some kind of joke, huh?
This is funny?
Well, see if this is funny, okay?
How about I see you in court?
-Court? -Yeah.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
[sighs] I'll tell you what.
How about we don't see you at all anymore?
Because you're fired.
Now that felt bloody amazing!
You see, sudden change, like explosion in the action movie.
Would you shut the fuck up about change? Just--
You know what?
This isn't over.
[Gregory] That's the spirit, Sammy! This isn't over!
Yeah!
Now, I thought Sammy was a girl's name?
You may pick anything.
[Junior] Uh, okay.
It's mightier than the sword.
No. It definitely isn't.
Do you know what a sword is, sir?
Of course I know what a sword is. It's okay. It's okay, dumb-dumb.
I've trained squirrel to sniff out landmines.
You can do this.
Now, shall we begin? Uh, sorry. Um…
Sorry, what are the goggles for?
Focus. Focus! One day this could be a life or death situation.
Now I need you to think of your weapon and how you can use it to protect yourself.
To protect myself from what?
From this!
Whoa! Whoa!
Wait! Okay? Uh… Maybe someone else can volunteer instead?
No, relax. Relax.
It's only a simulation. You'll hardly feel a thing.
That's not true. Come on!
Ah! Stop!
[Storm Force] Protect yourself! Use your other senses! You don't need your eyes.
What the fuck, man? It's just a pen!
It's not just a pen!
-It's whatever you need it to be! -[Junior] Shit!
You're such an embarrassment.
I'm cutting your hours to three shifts a week.
Sean?
Hey, Prince.
Wow, that's a really nice watch. Can I touch it?
You know what?
Actually, I'm the only one authorized to handle it.
And it's not a watch. Then what is it?
-It's a stop watch. -Isn't that a watch?
For fuck's sake! Please just go to your desk.
Okay.
Fucking knobface!
I'm not going to wait in, um…
Okay, Patrick. On your marks.
Get set. And… go.
Unbelievable.
Playing around with people's lives? Thinking that's a joke?
You think that's a joke? Think…
We'll see. We'll see.
Damn it.
Hey, you.
[Rosemary] Hey, baby. How's your day going? Oh, you know. Pretty normal.
Are you in your car?
Yeah. Yeah, I, um… I finished early.
Thought I'd surprise you.
[Rosemary] Oh, that's nice.
Would you mind stopping at the pharmacy?
Lebo's almost out of tablets.
Is she? Um…
Yeah. Yeah, um…
No problem. I'll…
I'll see you soon.
[Rosemary] Okay. Love you.
Love you too.
Fuck!
Fuck.
You shouldn't have done that. What if Zepler casts a frozen spell?
He can't. I picked up Grindol's shield, remember? Just try to keep up.
[man] That's right. Sorry. Sorry.
-[woman] As long as you've got my back. -[man] Don't you worry about that.
Where'd you guys get money to buy a new video game?
Hey, guys?
Where's the fridge?
[woman] Shh! Quiet! Please!
-[glass shatters] -Hey!
Please tell me you didn't sell the fridge to buy a fucking video game!
Dude, language! We don't go around swearing about your job.
We would never do that.
Dressing up like idiots and playing video games
isn't a fucking job!
You're both such losers!
I believe that our honor has been challenged.
I believe it has.
-You know what that means, my love? -What's it mean, babe?
It means I'm going to smite him with yonder broadsword!
Let's… Let's calm down.
Just put the sword down, Harry. Please.
You will have to pry it from my cold, dead fingers.
-Oh, shit. -Arm yourself.
-[woman chuckles] -Now battle is joined.
Oh, shit! [grunts]
[Harry] Come back here!
To the halls of Valhalla!
-Come hither! -[Junior] Harry, stop. Stop. Please!
-Harry, please! -Chop off his head!
[Junior] No, stop! Harry!
[Prince] I'm telling you, the whole place has gone mad.
I mean, who times people when they're taking a shit? What if they're constipated?
You can't do that to people.
This can't be legal. Know what? We need to contact our lawyer.
Get him on the phone--
There's always someone to blame, isn't there?
What?
Didn't you hear anything I just said?
The deal was five years, and yet again you've fallen short.
That is not fair. I never quit. I stuck it out.
You never put in the work. It was a joke to you!
What did you think was gonna happen?
Come on, Dad. Don't do this to me.
Wake up, boy. You did it to yourself.
Okay, you know what? I don't have to put up with this.
Well, you could always leave.
I mean, you're only what? Twenty-seven?
Fine. You want me gone? No problem.
Where're you going to go?
I don't know, Dad!
You know what? I don't care.
I will stay in my car if I have to.
Anywhere is better than this place. You know that?
Stupid chairs!
Hey, Chen. It's me. Um…
I was wondering if you're still interested in Zulcanoid?
Um, because if you are,
I think I might be able to make it happen.
So, yeah. Let me know, okay?
Thanks.
Hey, Chen. Um…
When I said let me know, I didn't mean like right now.
I didn't want you to change your mind. How soon can you get it?
I don't know. A couple of weeks, maybe. You need to hurry. I'm running outta time.
Yeah, okay. Chen, look.
I really need to know what you're going to use it for.
Like, for real.
I already told you.
It's for children to help with their medical equipment for the heart disease.
Uh, I thought you said cancer?
It's for both, okay? Look, Sam…
It's Zulcanoid. Not uranium.
I'm not building a bomb, okay?
Yeah, all right. Okay. Fine. Okay.
Good. Now let's talk money.
So we can bring all the girls to your yard for some fucky-fucky. Huh?
[Junior] You don't know what it's like.
Living with them is like a recurring nightmare.
In your apartment? Must be nice having walls.
You know what isn't nice?
Getting beaten up by a pathetic man-child and having to beg for my life.
But have you wasted every single day for the past five years, and now you're completely screwed?
-Oh, your trust fund? -Oh, dude. Please. No.
I don't think I have one of those. I'll check with my PA.
-[Prince] You don't. -Linda? [Sam] All right. Enough.
Okay? Everybody's having a shit time. All right?
We get it. Whining about it isn't going to change anything.
Then what do you suggest? Oh, do you really want to know?
I'm living in my car. So yeah, I would like to know.
Okay. What's the one thing we all need?
That'll make all our problems go away?
I don't know. A shitload of money?
-Yeah. -Exactly.
And I think… I think I know how to make that happen.
What? How?
By taking something that doesn't belong to us.
Come on, Sam. You've never even had a parking ticket.
And now you want to what? Rob a bank?
No, not rob a bank! Besides, it wouldn't even be stealing.
It would be taking back something that we've earned.
Something that we've dedicated our lives to.
[Prince] Okay.
What are you talking about?
I got an offer for 12 units of Zulcanoid.
-And it's a lot of money. -How much?
Two million.
What? From who?
It doesn't matter. Just, all you need to know is that he's legit,
and he's prepared to pay half upfront.
For a dozen units? That's it?
That's it.
Prince.
You know what? I don't care anymore.
It's the least we deserve, the way they've treated us.
Come on, guys.
I've lived my whole life going by the rules.
Right?
Sure, what's that gotten me, but…
Okay, well, if they want to play dirty… so can we, right?
Yes.
Let's do it. Let's do it.
Okay, dude. Keep it down.
-We're doing it. It's done. -I'm sorry. My God.
Just one thing, though.
We're not criminals.
So we're going to need some help figuring this out.
Why are you looking at him like that?
Fine! Fine. I know a guy.
Like, a felon?
[Prince] Am I the only one who thinks this is a really bad idea?
Just calm down, okay?
They're mostly just regular people with issues. No big deal.
Regular people? Hmm? With some issues?
Look, I know he's your dad, but I don't think we should be taking advice from a crazy person.
He's not crazy. His lawyer got him in here, okay?
-It was either this place or jail. -Okay.
But he knows what he's talking about.
And he's no snitch.
Do not speak to anyone you don't know. Keep your voice down at all times.
No sudden movement. No whistling. No singing. No dancing.
And do not accept any offers of food.
Oh. No singing? Such a pity.
Sorry. Um, question.
Have any of your guests ever been attacked in your experience?
They only attack the weak.
I'm sorry? What?
-Is he joking or…? -[Sam] Come on. Just go.
[Junior] There he is.
Come on.
I want to take out your eyes and eat them!
Take out your brain and eat it!
You want to come here? Come here, man! I'll show you something.
Ah, you want some?
Come. Want some of this?
Hey, Dad.
Junior!
-Hey, Dad. -What a lovely surprise!
Come here, son.
How're you doing? You doing alright, Dad?
No, I'm fine.
I'm keeping my head down. Keeping out of trouble.
That's great.
And who are these?
These are my friends. This is Prince and Sam.
-Prince! -Hello.
-Come here, young man. -Oh, okay.
Your hair smells… smells wonderful. What is it?
Fear mostly.
Funny! I like him.
Yes. And, um, he's… Sam. You're the smart one, aren't you?
The leader of the pack.
I can tell these things.
I'm not really a leader. Just, we're all friends.
Friends? Wonderful. Well, anyway. Let's sit down, gentlemen.
I assume this isn't a social call?
I'm guessing that you young boys need something from me.
We were hoping you could give us some advice.
We need to get our hands on something that
doesn't completely belong to us.
-Hello! -Oh my God!
You want to pat my dog?
Oh, um… Thank you. But, uh, no, thank you.
He doesn't bite. I promise.
He's a good boy. You're a good boy!
Yeah, it's not that.
I am just deathly allergic to dogs.
This is Fingers. And he's not gonna go anywhere unless you pat the dog.
-Yeah, I'm not doing that. -Pat the dog.
-No. -Pat the dog.
-No! -Just pat the damn dog!
All right, fine!
What is his name?
Little Bit.
Little Bit? Um, okay. "Little Bit" of what?
Mucus.
-[Prince] Oh my God. -That means snot.
-[Sam] Don't let go, Prince. -Guys, it's wet!
[Senior] We can carry on.
Fingers here blew his brains with crystal meth.
He won't remember a single thing. So, please.
Okay. Um…
If we were trying to lift something from, like, a warehouse, how would we go about that?
Well, what you'd always need to know.
The Five Ds.
Define. Delegate. Divert. Disguise.
And the most important one of them all,
do not get fucking caught.
That's it?
Yeah, pretty much.
Don't stop patting him!
-Okay. -He's almost asleep.
Yeah, I'm so sorry. Um… Sure, sure. Um…
Question. Hypothetically, what if we work at the place we're trying to hit?
Is that, like, a red flag or is it like--
Oh, no. Not necessarily.
No. You see, um, say for example,
if you left your fingerprints or a sample of hair or whatever.
They can't hold you to it.
Simply because, well, it's like a… a free fuck-up.
Right. Free fuck-up.
Mr. Moses, please, don't take this the wrong way, but
you're good at this sort of thing, right?
You tell me.
Wowzers! He is-- You are so good, sir!
-Oh, thank you. -[Sam] Seriously?
-What? -I'm so sorry.
You guys smell that?
Did one of you fart? Oh, he's done it again.
[Fingers] It's my special pudding.
-Oh my God. -I made it myself. You should try some.
-Oh my God! -It's delicious. It gives you superpowers.
Hey, Doc.
Thanks.
Focus.
Sorry! Uh, sorry. Are you okay?
I'm fine.
-Are you sure? -I'm good. I promise.
-Okay. -So? Where's the fire?
-The fire? Where, uh… What? -You look like you're in a rush.
I… Sorry. I just need to go start my shift.
Are you all right? You look a little nervous.
Nervous?
That's strange. I feel fine.
[chuckles] Yeah.
Oh, um, that's, um… That's a pity.
I thought… maybe I made you nervous?
Actually… yes, you do.
I was just trying not to make you feel bad about it. Uh…
But, um… you know what might help?
-What's that? -Well…
Maybe we could, you know, spend some more time together.
That way I wouldn't feel so nervous around you.
-If you think it might help? -I think it might.
-Okay. -Okay.
-I'll send you a text. -Perfect.
-Great. -Great.
Right. Great. Ah.
I've got to get going.
Got to go punch my cock. Punch the clock! Punch the clock. Uh,,,
Sorry! Excuse me.
Uh… Okay, bye.
-Bye. -Bye.
Sorry.
All right, guys. So?
When are we doing this? I vote Saturday night. It's the perfect time.
-Why? -It's the big game.
-Everybody's gonna be in the office. -What about patrols?
They only need to tag in every three hours. So we'll be good. Trust me.
You know what would help? If we got them drunk.
Yes, but how?
We could send them a shitload of beers. Right?
And a note from management thanking them for all their hard work.
Telling them to enjoy the game. Right?
That could actually work. But not everybody's going to get drunk.
Okay. Sure.
-We put tranquilizers in the beer! -What?
No! No, absolutely not. I don't want anybody getting hurt.
Oh, no. No one's gonna get hurt. We used to drug my grandmother all the time. It's perfectly safe.
What? You drugged your granny?
Oh, dude, don't start with me, okay? You don't know the shit we went through.
You know she used to shave our heads while we were sleeping?
-You want to know why? -Why?
I don't know. I'm still asking myself.
So it'll work.
They'll be fine. They'll be sleeping like kittens. Guys, I swear.
Okay, we can keep it in mind. But so long as it's safe.
It will be.
-All right, so… -Cool.
Saturday it is.
-Saturday! -[Sam] Perfect.
If one of us get caught, no snitching.
A spit oath? Um, I'm not shaking that.
Come on, man! We need to commit!
Yeah. No, thanks, man. I'm good.
Yeah. We really don't need an oath.
You know? We trust each other. Right?
-Yeah, yeah. -Yeah?
Fine, okay. I just thought that we were having a moment.
No, there was no-- We were not having any moments. Idiot.
To getting what we deserve.
To what we deserve. Hear! Hear!
[Junior on voicemail] Hey Portia. I was wondering if maybe you'd like to have dinner next week?
I'm even willing to pay half. That's a joke. Of course. Okay, thanks.
Okay.
You planning on running into any ninjas today?
Look, I would rather just have it than not have it.
Why you always got to give me shit?
-Because you're being ridiculous. -I am not.
-I am being prepared. -Mm-hmm.
Anyway, what did you bring? Where's your weapon?
I'm gonna get some air.
All right, you know what? Kill me for being a little nervous.
Shit is about to go down!
How can you be so calm? [Sam] I'm not. I'm just focused on the plan.
Which, in case you've forgotten, does not include any sword play.
[Prince] Oh God. What's he carrying? I have no idea.
Hey, guys. We good?
That really depends on what's in the giant bag.
The masks. Remember?
You need a giant bag for three masks?
Yes. If you're doing it right. Check it out.
What the hell's that?
What? What's wrong with it?
Nothing. I just didn't realize we were entering a children's TV show.
Normal masks aren't good enough! Okay?
We need to cover our whole heads!
Just try it on.
Is there only chicken masks?
No.
Oh, great. Yeah, I will just take one of the other ones. Thanks.
Okay, fine. Whatever.
All right, what do we have? Oh motherf--
-What? -A fucking unicorn! Seriously?
-What? -Why couldn't you get us cool shit?
Like dead presidents? Right?
This is the cool shit. Okay? Just trust me.
You know what? Just give them to me.
The masks are fine.
Could the two of you please focus?
If we screw this up, it's prison.
Remember that.
Yes, of course. Incarceration. I…
My head's in the game. I'm ready. Let's go.
Yeah, I'm even more ready than that.
Oh God, I did it again. I'm so sorry.
[Sam] Move.
-Shotgun. -Oh, Junior!
Seriously? You never heard of ski-masks? They're in every heist film you ever seen.
Know what your problem is? You're ungrateful.
-[Sam] Mm. -No wonder your dad doesn't like you.
Guys, it worked! They're all knocked out.
Okay, good. Good.
What about the cameras? You manage to turn them off?
Yeah. Hard drive's in my bag.
I told you it would work.
One shouldn't throw the word "genius" around, but…
Yeah, let's not get ahead of ourselves, all right?
How's it looking up there?
Like a ghost town.
Okay. Uh, I'm on my way.
Oh, this is such a tragedy.
Now, I'm not normally one to point fingers.
But I'm fairly sure I told you not to eat the humans.
-Why would you think it was me? -Because it's always you!
Every time we get on a planet, it's the same bloody story.
The locals slide down your neck!
It's disgusting!
You know what? Maybe it was him!
No, no. No, no. No. It wasn't him
because he has food allergies, and you know it.
Well, I wonder what that could be.
I don't know. I don't have mind-reading protocol.
You've got a problem!
And Control's going to hear about it.
I've got eyes on the ridiculous unicorn.
He's heading in.
Why a unicorn?
[Portia] Who are you?
Why are you doing this?
Okay, so it's not really who we are that's important. It's what we are.
You see…
we're aliens.
From outer space.
Just like in your movies.
You know? Movies?
This is where we get our accents from.
So I choose a Russian spy with sexy protocol.
[in Jamaican Patois] Yeah, man. And I choose the best of all. A Rastafarian from Jamaica.
[in English] And I'm a fusion of the two greatest humans that ever lived,
Mahatma Gandhi and Kylie Minogue.
[Gregory] You are?
Hey. How's it going in there?
He's covered by ten feet of concrete. He can't hear you from here.
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My bad.
Over and out.
[Badrick] All right, baby. I'll tell you a story.
But I think for you, it will be a nightmare.
Because this here scary.
What you call Zulcanoid came here on a meteor
when our moon exploded.
Our job is to find it.
Not only does it regenerate the skin,
it repairs our bodies,
gives us energy.
Basically, it keeps us alive.
[Anya] You see?
It make me like new woman.
In a few days we are going to take all the Zulcanoid.
That is not good news for you and your friends.
Because it's fire upon Babylon!
We're gon' burn up everything!
Nothing personal, you understand?
Just protocol.
[Junior] Sam! Start the car. Our new bosses are in the vault and they're not human!
-Hey! Uh-huh. Horses aren't allowed here. -No. Shh. I'm not a horse. It's a mask.
-No! You need to go home. -Get away!
Run! Run!
-Come on. Come on! -[engine sputtering]
[Junior] Go, go, go, go, go!
Come on! Go, go, go!
-[Prince] Go, go, go, go, go! -[engine sputtering]
-All right! -[Junior] Get us the fuck out of here!
-I'm trying! -Come on!
Oh my God!
What? What now? I think that was a limb!
-[Sam] What? -It flew across the window!
How about a snack?
What the fuck is going on?
Where'd they come from? Why did their skin glow?
No! No. This can't be happening! [laughs]
-Junior! Hey! Junior! -This is not happening.
What? What? What?
Junior, I need you to focus, okay?
-I need you to focus. -Okay. Focus.
Tell me what happened. Okay?
What happened in the vault?
What happened in the vault? They, uh… they had someone tied up.
Um, they said that they needed Zulcanoid for their bodies. It heals their skin or some shit. Um…
Ah… Fuck! What? What's going on?
What? What's going on?
They're going to…
They're gonna steal the Zulcanoid, and then they're gonna burn everyone.
That's it. That's their plan. Burn… Who? Who's going to burn?
-Who's burning? -The aliens! That's who's gonna burn everyone. The aliens!
Oh, God. I need something to breathe in.
Is there like a plastic bag or some shit?
Oh God…
Sam. Sam, what are we going to do?
I don't know. I need a minute to think. Okay?
People are getting dismembered while you think! Oh my God! There is no need to be so overdramatic!
Overdramatic? It's fucking aliens, Sam! They're going to fucking eat your intestines and do "whooo-ooh!"
What the hell is "whoo-ooh!"?
It's the alien sound! That's the sound they play for aliens!
Fuck!
[Prince's father] You're weak. Just like your mother.
[Colleen] He's always late. He lies all the time.
[father] You don't have the stomach…
[Colleen] Basically, he's the worst staff member we've ever had.
[father] It was a joke to you. What'd you think was gonna happen?
[Colleen] Clean that or I'll give you another warning.
[father] Coward.
-[Prince] We need to stop. -Say what now?
We need to pull over.
Oh, I am not pulling over right now.
Now! Pull over now! I am being serious!
Okay.
My dad was right.
I've been a coward my whole life.
And I'm sick of it.
If we keep going, I will never change.
Yeah, I will never.
We need to go back.
Oh, we need to go back!
He's right.
These are our people. We drugged them. We did that.
We can't leave them behind.
No. No.
We can't. They're our people.
We go back.
We're going back.
We go fucking back.
How's everyone feeling?
We're going to need some weapons.
You mean like this?
Not so ridiculous now, is it?
Oh, nunchucks. Nice.
Did it come with a Bruce Lee poster?
Yeah, it did, actually.
Is that a problem?
No, not at all. As long as they don't break while fighting an alien,
then everything's all good.
If I were you, I'd be more worried about my table ornament.
Table ornament?
Dude, I'll have you know that this was crafted by a master swordsmith in Osaka.
So it's basically unbreakable.
Guys. Hey.
Sorry. Sorry.
Wait.
We don't let them get away. We fight to the death.
Why do you keep spitting on yourself?
What is wrong with you?
Come on, man! This is a real moment. We're probably gonna die here.
We are not going to die. Okay?
How do you know?
I just know.
Now come on. Let's go get these assholes.
Last thing, that is disgusting. Also, a spit oath is not a real thing.
-It is a real thing. -Yeah. If you're, like, eight.
-Wait. Wait! -What?
The vault door.
What about it?
-Their lives depend on Zulcanoid, right? -Right.
So why would they leave the vault door open?
It's a trap. Oh, shit.
[Badrick] Wagwan!
Oh, shit. They look really happy to see us.
That is a terrible sign.
This is it.
I'll take the office. I'll take the vault.
-Good luck. -You too.
Whoa. Whoa! You guys are leaving me with him?
There's three of them, there's three of us.
You have a sword. He doesn't. You'll be fine.
Dude, you can take him.
Definitely.
Okay. I can… I can take him.
Looks like it's just you and me, Princey.
This is going to be so much fun.
Just the two of us dancing through the night.
Dancing and fighting. The two things I can't do. Fuck!
What you have there?
It's a… It's a samurai sword.
Yeah, it's from Osaka, so it's really legit.
Princey have a sword.
Princey have a sword!
What you gon' do with it? Chop off me head?
Um. I was maybe thinking about it. But--
There's only one problem, man.
You brought a sword to a gunfight.
Let me show you what I have.
Holy shit!
Oh, Princey!
Oh my fucking shit!
So what? We're hiding now?
I could've sworn he was right here.
Hello, mate. I believe you humans call it teleportation.
I knew you'd come back. You're a feisty one.
But it's a big mistake.
Yeah, well, you know what? The way I see it… it's only a big mistake… if I don't kick your ass.
Well, Sammy, that's your first problem.
I don't have an ass.
My name is not Sammy!
Portia! What're you doing here?
I was looking for you.
What?
It doesn't matter! Listen… we're under attack.
I know how this is gonna sound, our new owners are aliens. And they're trying to kill everyone!
Calm down. It's okay.
What do you mean? Death is just a part of change.
[Russian accent] Nothing to be worried about. Excuse me?
Surprise!
Oh God.
I tell you what.
I'll let you take a free swing.
Give it all you've got.
See if you can reach mi neck.
God, you're hard to look at.
Or we could just keep talking?
I think there's a lot we could learn from each other.
So, what's your planet like?
I'm sure it's so lovely.
It's a free hit, man!
Do it while you still can!
Okay, Prince. You can do this. Come on, man! Don't be a pussy!
[Gregory] Sammy!
Sammy! Did you know that humans can actually fly?
[laughs] Oh yeah! If you wanted to, you could cut through the air like a bloody gazelle.
There's only one small hiccup.
The landing.
Ooh, crikey!
-[coughs] -[Gregory] That's got to hurt.
Pathetic.
How much body percent fat are you anyway, huh?
I really do hope that you're not too hairy.
You humans are so soft.
Like little jellyfish.
That's why you're so tasty.
I just make clowning with you!
I don't have the pain receptors. So…
You know?
But you do.
[Prince] Oh my God!
That was probably an ornament.
Fuck!
-[Gregory] Come on, mate. -Ah, shit.
Wake up.
Where you gonna go?
In case you haven't noticed, I can go anywhere I want!
-[Gregory laughs] -Fuck!
Okay. Here's a clue.
Shit.
[Gregory] The more intelligent the life-form, the less physical matter.
I'm 92% gas, mate.
Mainly hydrogen and a lovely little bit of butane.
So that's why throwing things at me…
…is not gonna help you.
You know what? You're right.
Well, halle-bloody-lujah! He's finally getting it! [laughs]
But there's something you should know.
Oh, yeah? What's that, mate?
I'm a goddamn geologist.
Which makes me an expert in gas, asshole.
Any last wishes, Princey?
Yes, actually.
If you're gonna kill me, I'm not dying on my knees.
No problem, mon.
But you close your eyes.
This is going to hurt.
I don't care.
I'm not closing my eyes.
Even though I really want to.
Aren't you the brave one?
Suit yourself.
Oh my shit! Oh my shit!
Hey, man!
Good timing.
Like, really good timing!
Yeah, you okay?
Yeah, I… [exhales]
I think so.
I did ruin my pants, though. But…
Better my pants than my face, right?
Good to know.
-Let's go. We've got to find Junior. -Um…
Maybe he's already at the car. You know what?
-I'll go check. -Prince. Let's go.
Okay. Oh God.
You want to know what they call me back on my planet?
Something like… "The Devourer." Huh?
Do you want to see why?
Yes?
Oh shit!
Get away from him, you monster! No! Portia, no! Run!
Thank you.
No problem.
-Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine.
-You sure? -What about you?
-Your leg? -I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
It's nothing. I can barely feel it.
How'd you know?
Found out they were made of gas.
So I took a chance.
Uh, good call.
Hey. So you took him out? The big guy?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I slapped him around a bit,
and then sliced his head off. Just like…
So Sam saved you too? Yeah, 100 percent.
Right.
Is that a pen in your leg?
Yeah.
Oh my God, dude. We need to take it out, like, right now.
What? No?
You could get ink poisoning. It's fatal. Ink poisoning isn't a thing.
Oh, dude. It's really a thing.
Sorry.
-Just let me-- -Whoa! Wait!
What if it's in an artery? Huh? I could bleed to death.
There's a small chance of that. But there's hardly any major arteries in your legs.
That's not true.
Okay, trust me! I have a medical degree, okay?
You studied for three months online, Prince. You don't know shit!
Okay, that's just semantics.
-I think… Just let-- -[Junior] Can you stop?
-Please. Just-- -Just be brave! -[squelching] -[groans]
Here you go.
-Ah… -Now, can we please get out of here? Okay?
Yeah. Of course.
You can put your-- Okay.
What did she do to you?
I don't know. I mean, I just blacked out. All I remember is I was cleaning outside of her office--
Whoa! Okay, Portia! Guys, wait!
Take it easy.
Is she okay?
I just need to catch my breath.
Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Wow. All this time I thought it was "breathe out, then in."
-What? -Oh, shit.
What a night.
I'm still trying to process everything. You know?
[Prince] Tell me about it.
I'm gonna need years of therapy after this. I mean, those were real aliens, you know?
We didn't imagine that.
Hey, man. Um…
-Don't move. -What?
No! Don't move.
What is it?
It's probably nothing.
Prince! Dude, what is it?
Oh, shit.
Okay. I can fix this! Wait, I'm going to be a paramedic.
I can fix this.
I can do this.
-Prince. Give me the leg. -No. -Give me the leg. Let go! -No! I can't let go!
-No! He needs it. -Let go!
Legs are important! Okay?
He doesn't need his legs because he's dead!
Gone! Okay?
I'm sorry, but there's nothing you can do for him now!
No! [grunts]
It doesn't matter, okay? All I need is a first-aid kit,
a shitload of bandages.
I can do this. I can do this.
Bandages?
Dude, what're you talking about?
Are you crying? No. No, not at all! I'm…
Whoa! I… I think I'm allergic to the aliens.
You had another one of those stupid visions?
No, I didn't have one of those stupid visions, okay? Shut up.
-Can you walk? -Yeah, I can walk.
Yeah, I got you.
Thanks.
-You good? -Yeah.
You know what sucks?
We just saved everyone, and no one's gonna know.
That's okay. We'll know.
Oh, please. Don't act like you don't care.
You're just trying to impress your girlfriend.
No, that's not it. I'm not-- And she's not my girlfriend.
Are you?
You can be such an idiot sometimes, Junior.
I love you too.
Uh, I mean, I like you.
You like me too, so…
We like each other.
I love you.
I think my luck's changing!
What the fuck just happened?
Melusi.
He must've put paint in the Zulcanoid.
Overheated in the car. What were you saying about luck changing?
Sam? What're you doing?
Sam?
[Sam] Often the solutions to our problems are a lot closer than we think.
Sometimes they're right in front of us.
Oh my goodness! It works.
[Sam] Turns out the real value of Zulcanoid is what it can do for damaged skin.
And that changed everything.
Dude, I still can't believe that this is our place.
[laughs] I mean, look at this view!
It's ridiculous.
It beats the shit out of my car, that's for sure.
You know I've never had a roommate before?
It's gonna be a new journey for us, man.
You don't meditate in the mornings, like… naked?
Anything like that, right?
I mean, I don't, but if that's something you want to try?
No!
That's not what I meant.
Sorry. I just misread.
Never mind. Let's just pretend…
What did you even say?
-What? -[Portia] Um…
So I do most of my things naked. Are you boys okay with that?
100% fine with that. Yeah.
Beers in the fridge.
Thank you.
-Don't do that. -Oh my God. She winked at me.
-No, she didn't. -Dude.
I am a medical professional. The human body means nothing to me.
That's not true.
I took an oath.
I don't believe you.
-I did. Yeah. -Prince!
That's… That's not funny. Wait. Don't do that.
[Junior] AMI didn't just get a new lease on life,
they got a new leader.
Someone who we could all get behind.
And he made sure that everyone got what they deserved.
They say you stole over 50 million.
Is it true?
That's a lie. I didn't steal anything.
[guard] Ha! Whatever you say, Chief.
Welcome to your new home.
Hey. You want to pat my dog?
[guard] You're lucky.
Fingers here makes a very special pudding.
It's a secret recipe. I'm busy making some right now.
Oh my God.
[Prince] Does anyone want to tell me what this creepy place is?
[Sam] It's our old refinery. We used to process Zulcanoid here.
[Prince] Oh, how fascinating. I was hoping to go on a work tour on a Saturday.
[Junior] This isn't a work tour, okay?
As the new head of security, I've been checking out all our sites.
And last night, I found something unbelievable.
And I mean unbelievable!
Why didn't you just take a video of this unbelievable thing
and send it to me?
No. This is something that you need to see for yourselves.
Okay?
-You guys ready? -[Prince] For what?
To be disappointed?
Ah! Probably how Portia feels. Just shut up! Come on.
Tell me that isn't the dopest shit you've ever seen!
Oh my God.
Now we know how they got here. And this isn't even the best part.
What do you mean?
Wait till you see what's inside.
What's inside?
I don't recall this. It's not true.
And even if it were, I have no memory of it.
-You're caught! -What are you doing? -You will die. -What are you doing?
-You will die. -What are you doing?
Long live freedom!
Farewell… Claude Pinoche.
I, Second Lieutenant Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, swear…
…fulfill my duties, in accordance with laws and regulations.
To promptly obey orders…
…in order to be a brave and honorable soldier…
Papi, what's wrong?
-Grab hold of him. -Mom!
Hold him up!
What's wrong, Dad? I can't do it on my own. Someone give me a hand.
-Don't worry. He's fine. -He's not fine.
Dad!
What's happening?
-Dad! -Take his pulse.
-Stop it, Dad. -I don't know how to take someone's pulse.
Thank you, my general.
Murderer.
Heil!
NEW MARKETS NON-GLOBAL CHILE
Madam.
Let me see.
What did he eat yesterday?
Same as today.
Only vegetables, as usual.
I don't get it.
He says he wishes to die, he stops drinking blood,
and now he goes off to hunt?
It is odd.
I don't want Augusto to die.
I'm at your service, madam.
Salute me, then.
Prepare yourself. My kids are coming.
To steal from my general.
To steal from me.
Allow me.
ARK
You'd think Dad would slow down in his old age, but apparently not.
We don't know who's hunting for those hearts.
-We don't? -No. Not at all.
What do you know?
The same as you.
Hey. No one here is judging you. I'm not judging you either.
We're too old to be so naive. We're clearly all here for a reason.
I came because I heard they'd give us money.
I just said that to get you here, stupid.
-So they're not giving us anything? -Please.
Of course they'll give us money. Relax.
They're not going to. Not one peso.
We have to find it ourselves.
That money's hidden in papers, documents, and folders.
People are freaked out over these murders.
Well, who wouldn't be?
Entire human hearts are being removed.
It's bizarre.
I hope they find him soon.
-Who? -The killer.
-They should've found him by now. -Who?
The police.
I just don't want them coming here. That's all I ask.
We shouldn't have to wait our whole lives to get our inheritance.
It's not that long. But some people do live longer than they should.
-You think so? -I do.
EXTRA CONCENTRATED CHILI PEPPER
Afternoon. Good afternoon, my general!
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
To what do I owe this delightful visit?
We were worried, Dad.
Sure you were. I've been on the verge of death before. We've said our goodbyes many times.
Dad, someone has been feasting on hearts in Santiago.
Someone?
It could've been me… but that wouldn't make much sense.
Why would I want to keep on living in a country where people hate me?
They don't hate you.
No.
-Well, they should. -They're so ungrateful.
That is true. They are ungrateful. It's a real pain in the ass.
Though I'll admit, I've made some mistakes.
Mistakes with accounting.
Oh, really?
Well, you know.
-Know what, Dad? -No. Actually, we don't know anything.
It's a real mess. Every day, your mom asks me about secret bank accounts
and real estate properties around the world.
I can't remember. None of it. What can I do? I haven't a clue.
And yet, the other day, thinking it over, something came to me.
What?
I've got some old books in the basement.
There, with the help of a lawyer and a former minister,
we hid some papers. I don't know. Accounts, receipts, contracts.
Who knows? But they might be worth something.
Dad?
Why now, Dad? Well, I'd forgotten. But now I remember.
I asked you a thousand times before. Well, I had forgotten until now, which is why I am telling you.
Well, I had forgotten until now, which is why I am telling you.
Why the long faces?
You should be happy.
If those papers are worth anything, make sure you share them among yourselves.
Give half to your mom, and split the rest between you.
And with that, I'll be off. I'm tired. I believe I will die tonight.
Best of luck to all of you. I love you very much.
With all my heart. Truly.
Permission to speak freely, my general.
Go ahead.
I love you, my general.
I love you, Dad.
-I love you. -I love you.
-I love you. -I love you, Papi.
Lucía?
Don't make me say those things in front of the children.
I'm into you.
You turn me on. You drive me wild… you old minx.
Will you show me the cannons before you die?
Make me sweat like you used to?
I'll ride you like a bandit's horse.
Was it you who went out hunting?
No, madam. I don't need to.
The papers.
Madam?
The money.
Excuse me.
Why can't I seem to die?
-Because you don't want to. -Of course I do.
I've been alive for 250 years. But we could live 250 more.
I don't want to live another 250 years. Good heavens.
Why not? They said I was a thief.
You can call a soldier a killer, or whatever else, but not a thief.
I killed hundreds of Reds. Hundreds of them.
But, for the rest of my life, they'll say I'm a thief. They humiliated me. They… They did.
But you did steal, didn't you?
How about this? You… bite me.
And we'll go out hunting at night.
Just for blood.
Then we'll go to the basement, where you keep the hearts.
We'll eat them.
And we'll be young again.
Then we'll go to another country, with new names.
As fifteen-year-olds.
With another army.
But I just don't understand why I can't manage to die.
You're putting blood in my food.
You're putting blood in my food to keep me alive.
-Aren't you? -No.
"President Allende, the army won't betray you!"
What?
That's what I said to him.
And then what…? I betrayed him the very next day.
It was my idea.
Yes, but no one knows that.
It was an old vendetta of mine.
I was on a mission. A mission to crush.
To crush the anarchists.
To crush the trade unionists, the Republicans, and the freed slaves.
But then you fell in love with me.
We've been together for 60 years.
What more do you want? You've had it all. Kids, grandkids…
You've been the queen of this desert.
What is there to complain about?
We have brandy every night. We talk. We sleep holding hands.
What else do you want? To become a monster like you.
No. There has to be more than this.
Papers in English. Bank letters, bonds, cashier's checks, bearer documents…
Things like that.
What about this?
Let me see.
Stuff like this.
Is your friend coming?
-She's not my friend. -Who's coming?
-Did you tell that accountant of yours? -I did.
He can't come. He's sending his assistant. Now?
-It's what we agreed. -I didn't.
-Can we trust her? -Sure. She's from a military family.
-But she's a woman. -Yes.
Excuse me.
Is she young?
-Yeah. -Who cares?
As long as she understands this and doesn't talk to the press, she'll do.
Do we have to pay her? Of course. And handsomely, so she won't become a liability.
Of course. And handsomely, so she won't become a liability.
Is this all there is?
I'll need to check with my general.
But I would say no.
We're rich, then.
We certainly are.
-Merci. -May I?
Thank you.
Good morning.
Hello. Finally.
Dad!
What?
This is the accountant who's going to help us.
What's her name?
Carmen.
Carmencita.
I'm here to count your silver coins and weigh your gold.
Discreetly, of course.
That would be wonderful.
But I'm afraid I don't have much left. I'm poor.
In that case, I'll find money you didn't even know you had.
-Is that French? -Well, yeah.
Please forgive my… Do you understand my childlike French?
It seems I'm forgetting the language of my Sun King.
This language of treason and war can never be forgotten.
Perhaps.
The New Testament says that God only understands the French language.
And if I remember correctly,
it says that God listens with love to those who whisper in His ear in French.
God is in love with the beauty that He himself has envisioned.
He's a vain artist.
An artist who created women… to be perfect.
Beautifully said.
Yes.
Very beautiful, indeed.
-Thank you. -But of course.
Make yourself at home.
Excuse me.
It must be a case of possession. Like permanently carrying
-the enemy of our Lord. -Right, but…
You think the devil got inside his body?
-Yes. He did. -How?
Sometimes he finds a way in through a wound. This happens to soldiers on the battlefield.
Other times, he finds his way through the anus, when a man performs acts of sodomy.
Watch your mouth.
My father was always a patriotic soldier.
Of course. It must have happened through a combat wound.
-Right. -Of course.
Hey.
What if he was born this way?
Maybe he's one of those animals…
An animal from hell? Sure. Like a man without a soul. A dog.
Beasts do live among us. Creatures of the devil with no soul.
Nothing but black smoke inside their chests.
They can't be saved. All you can do is kill them.
I don't want my father to suffer. Honestly, it'll be a fierce battle.
Satan may be pathetic and melodramatic, but he is tireless.
If I run out of strength, he may kill me.
I couldn't care less.
-Oh. -I'm kidding.
-Honey? -Yes?
Treat my father with care.
Violence is the way of the devil. God's love will suffocate him.
The holy water will burn him.
Once the invader retreats, your father will be at death's door.
He will be bedridden. If he survives, it will mean he's always had a soul.
Even if there's only a bit of good soul in there,
that soul belongs to the Holy Spirit. And I will save it.
This document mentions 12 apartments.
Investments like these that generate income without work
are common in families unwilling to work.
There should be 14.
Fourteen. -There are no records of that here. -What?
How can properties go missing? Come on. No big deal. 12, 14. It's all the same.
Come on. No big deal. 12, 14. It's all the same.
No, we have to clear this up. We're talking about my money here.
-Your money? -Yeah, my money.
Quiet. Let her work in peace.
Am I bothering you?
No. Nothing bothers me. I love seeing this kind of jealousy and violence.
Irrational behavior like this will lead you to betray one another.
My strategy is to sow confusion.
Because accusations and betrayal are bound to follow.
So I'm not bothering you?
-Uh-uh. -You're bothering me. I'm trying to work.
What's this CEMA Chile?
Center for Chilean Mothers. It's right there.
ESTATE SUMMARY You diverted money from the Army's Command Headquarters,
which came from the sale of weapons and gear, to CEMA Chile, correct?
Mom?
There are no accounting documents.
It says here the president of CEMA was the First Lady. That means you.
Reserve funds were also transferred from embassy attaché offices,
from the Military Chiefs to CEMA Chile.
Just as well all this information has come to light, huh?
I don't get it. Are we discussing your inheritance here, Mom?
-I'm not dead yet, dear. -No, but goddammit.
It's just layer after layer of lies, Mom.
Well, those lies are about to make you a millionaire.
If he's going to die, we gotta fix this.
I don't know what you're fighting over.
I'll transfer everything we find to you immediately.
-Like the winter home. -What winter home?
-In La Parva? -No, Aspen.
United States?
No way. Dad gave me that house because none of you ever cared for skiing.
-I'd like to learn. -Dad, weren't we splitting things evenly?
He gave this to me, and no one else but me.
I can't stand injustice.
I was looking over your case.
After reviewing that filthy slander…
It says you ordered the disappearance and murder of thousands of Chileans.
-Me? -Yes.
There is also evidence against you regarding secret documents.
Ill-gotten money. Because of this, I believe that you have assets hidden from the law.
Yes. That's why I had to die. They wanted to meddle in everything.
Sure. But you didn't die when they say you did.
Even now, I can see you're breathing as healthy as an ox in spring.
-Oh, yeah? -Yes.
How about that.
Could you tell me where we might find these secret accounts?
Certainly. I had to withdraw the money because my kids don't know how to work.
-I don't want them to starve to death. -Of course.
-But don't take me for a thief. -Not at all.
Thieves steal what isn't theirs, while you use your power to get rich.
-Exactly. -Which is the only way.
I was a taciturn general.
An intellectual.
Until someone convinced me
I had to stage a coup to overthrow Allende's Marxist-Leninist regime.
After that, I was surrounded by refined gentlemen who smelled of cologne.
One very refined man came along and offered me money.
I had no idea what to do. He said, "Don't worry."
"I'll open a bank account for you in the Caribbean." So I said, "Fine."
Not long after, he asked for a favor.
He wanted to purchase state-owned companies for peanuts.
That's when I realized this man was blackmailing me.
After that, people came from all over to talk to me.
They offered me the world. Long story short, I became rich.
So rich that Lucía got a chandelier to go over the bathtub.
I also became famous worldwide for defeating Communism.
It's a shame you fell victim to such despicable manipulation.
And that you unknowingly became involved in influence peddling.
Inadvertently receiving payoffs from soulless businessmen.
Yes, I really have been a victim in all this.
Though that's hard to believe since you are a captain general.
A hero who's supposed to be smarter than those businessmen.
Of course.
Have you ever considered donating your fortune to church-run charities?
If I did that, my children would kill me.
But isn't that what you want? To be killed?
Well, yes, but now…
I've decided it would be nice to start a new life.
Well, if you really want to repeat that same horror again,
we better find that lost fortune in these papers.
Fair point.
I ask personal questions because they're necessary for my work.
But I'm also a curious person and like to lay things bare with my voice.
That's great. Wonderful.
What are you planning to destroy in your new life?
The International Court in The Hague.
And then… I'm not sure.
I haven't given it much thought. I've only now decided to keep on living.
I hope I've inspired you with my presence. You have.
Men of sin have told me that my body has something that invites second chances.
-What's that? -I'm not sure.
Maybe it's because I smell of bird of paradise flowers.
It could also be a new hormone that changes the aroma of my sweat.
Well, I don't… I can't quite smell your scent.
Is Dad not coming down for lunch?
Are you coming in?
Of course I am.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come…
Hail Mary…
Don't go hunting, my general.
Why not?
Don't make me waste my time. I'm helping you die.
Make no mistake. I'm not pleased with your services.
Killing Reds? Anyone can do that.
No, not just anyone. I taught my soldiers to kill for pleasure.
And frying women's breasts with electricity,
did you do that for pleasure too?
I did it with love, even.
Pleasure…
When I finally bit you, you dropped your pants.
Why was that?
Don't go hunting, my general.
That woman, the accountant, is a nun.
She wants to cast the devil out of me.
But I…
I've got nothing inside.
Me neither.
We're two beasts of the night. And the night is made for thieves like you.
I liked killing.
You liked stealing. No, I liked the killing too.
But I can't live like a peasant, Fyodor.
I need something to build on. Something solid.
I need people to help me. Servants like you. I cannot bear to wash dirty sheets.
What dirty sheets?
The ones you and Lucía will soil.
But I've never touched her.
You haven't yet?
No.
Well, go ahead and touch her.
But go easy on those howls of pleasure.
They're way too feminine.
You may keep my wife. She's my gift to you.
Do with her what you will.
But the money is mine.
May I take your picture?
You and your siblings were sent to jail in 2007 for embezzlement--
We were political prisoners.
Of course. But you were also accused of hitting--
How will you perform this exorcism?
With God's love. And if you can't get the demon out?
-That's up to the Holy Spirit. -Screw the Holy Spirit.
What's your plan if you can't get the devil out of him?
I can kill him with a plastic bag.
-How's that? -I'll put it over his head.
Suffocate him. -Then I'll cut-- -And his genitals?
-That won't be necessary. -Cut it all off.
Did you know about the secret papers, cashier's checks, and bearer bonds?
-Is that a yes? -Yes.
Why didn't you look for them earlier, during all these years your father's been… a walking corpse?
Like you said, we were under investigation by those leftist judges.
It wasn't wise to come looking for undeclared money.
Anyway, my mother figured out a way to continue receiving donations.
And some of those donations made their way to us.
After the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001,
the US Senate forced several financial institutions
to lift bank secrecy to investigate how terrorism was being financed.
Damn gringos.
They just so happened to look into your family and your accounts under false names.
Then they put Osama bin Laden's photo right next to your father's.
-How many accounts are we talking? -In the US, 125, give or take.
Give or take?
The ones the judge found. But he didn't dig deep enough.
He didn't see the ones in Germany, the Bahamas, or Gibraltar, for example.
Your father went by several aliases, including Daniel López,
to hide his illicit activities.
Why did he choose such a run-of-the-mill name?
It's not a criminal alias. No!
It's not exactly a stage name. It's a nom de guerre.
To wage war on the laws that protect the country from financial crimes.
He used it to make--
To generate an income comparable to the fortunes
of the hundreds of businessmen he helped make millionaires.
So he created a mediocre illegal alias to fulfill an entirely noble goal?
Well, it may be an illegal act according to the laws of this ungrateful country,
but a blessed act in the eyes of divine justice.
You see, our dad is a martial arts expert and can hold his breath for ten minutes.
-Or more. -More?
-Or more. -More? His pulse too.
So, on our mom's birthday, when he had that episode,
the doctors went into his room, checked his vitals, and declared him dead.
Could he do the same thing again?
No. Because now he actually wants to die.
Maybe the name came from some distant relative.
Or perhaps, back in the '80s, the captain general
killed a Daniel López, burned his body, and threw him into the sea from a chopper.
-My dad could never kill anyone. -Of course not.
His subordinates committed those heinous acts of violence.
I'm talking about your father's mysterious sense of humor.
It's possible the captain general used the name of a missing detainee
to defraud, to make a cruel joke
that only Daniel López's real killers would understand.
That's impossible. My dad hasn't got a sense of humor.
-I love him. -I know.
Do you believe in God and all that? -Yes. In all that. -I went to a traditional Catholic school.
-Yes. In all that. -I went to a traditional Catholic school. When Franco died, three of the nuns committed suicide.
Why does God allow the devil to live on? He could've killed him by now, right?
A sublime mystery, but we put our faith in the Lord.
We tell him that we are content not knowing his reasons
because one day we'll reside in the bristly bosom of his desires.
-Do you understand? -Of course.
But what if the devil is inside me? I like whiskey, men, cars, and expensive sneakers.
Is that the devil? That is definitely Satan calling.
And what does God have to offer? Pure, true love.
My dream… is to one day look upon the face of my eternal God.
For fuck's sake. I bet God sends us to this world to see if we're tempted by the devil.
And I was tempted. I did things… Lust, that's my problem. I'm nasty.
Nasty nasty.
Sorry.
No, don't be. I agree with you.
In fact, I came into this world to meet the devil.
To live with him.
To love him.
To be tempted.
So he would touch me. So I could touch him.
So I could humiliate him. So he could see me work.
You do know your sister told me everything? What did she tell you?
Your sister called me to come save your father's heavy and seething soul.
His invaded soul.
That's exactly what we've been praying for, for so long.
All generals who win wars have the right to pillage
and make a fortune.
Of course. And it is very sad to see that their heirs, such as you,
cannot share in the honor of their glory.
The undefeated Chilean army
allowed your father to use it to launder money?
If you think so, it could be true.
But look, years ago, I bought a steel company from the army.
Pretty cheap. Really cheap.
Because it was bankrupt.
And a couple of years later,
I sold that company back to the army for three million dollars.
That comes out to be… How much? Like 1,000% profit.
I don't know the exact percentage. I've never been good at math.
You saved the company? No, it was still bankrupt. I didn't do anything.
So, the Chilean army bought a broke steel company
using your father's checks?
Yup.
Then you deposited those three checks, for a total sum of three million dollars,
into secret bank accounts in Washington, under false names.
Yup.
-Yup. -But it was all under the radar.
When it came to light, we weren't investigated. We continued on with our lives as usual.
-Happy and free. -Excuse me, sir.
You're free because your father threatened a new coup if you were investigated.
Yes, but all Christian Democrats back then were in agreement.
And it really worked.
Three million dollars in personal checks. Three million.
It sounds like a lot, but in the grand scheme of things, it's really not.
Compare it to Fulgencio Batista or Ferdinand Marcos.
Next to those guys, our fortune's a pittance.
Now, they were corrupt. And murderers too.
Your simplemindedness is fascinating. "My father stole less than this other thief."
Only a villain can say that. An empty husk who doesn't believe in humanity.
Thank you.
Are there more documents hidden in this house? No.
How did they get here in the first place? Do you recall?
They were brought in by helicopter. Only I wasn't here.
And you hid them in the basement?
Perhaps.
Having to drink blood to survive.
-It must be a dreadful sacrifice. -Dreadful.
Imagine the humiliation of having to hide all that money
to sustain a never-ending life.
But where is the money? I'm figuring it all out. But tell me.
-Are there accounts in Panama? -Yes.
-Okay. -Six of them.
Seven.
Can you wire money from those accounts now?
No, I can't.
We bought antique books, collector's items.
My dad was into that sort of thing.
-You know what I mean? -No, I don't.
My dad accumulated a ton of junk.
Napoleon's hat.
A sword owned by O'Higgins.
And a dress that belonged to some queen they had in France.
One last question.
That butler…
He drinks blood too.
He's a white Russian.
He killed thousands of Bolsheviks. The ones in this country, of course.
Payback for the Russian Revolution that sent his family into exile.
Here, he trained torturers.
My dad bit him on the leg to thank him for his service and give him eternal life.
But you do realize that butler is a brutish fellow.
He's only got one testicle. Just like Hitler.
And he can't eat normal food. If he doesn't eat meat, he eats human feces.
Or animal feces.
That's why he licks the anuses of sheepdogs. Haven't you seen him?
No.
Not yet.
You've been accused of killing over 300 political prisoners. -You must be proud. -I am completely innocent.
-You must be proud. -I am completely innocent.
You were sentenced to 865 years in prison.
I'm not sure how you can be here. There's someone else with your name and likeness
who is in prison, serving your sentence.
I only happen to be me.
The Chilean army taught me torture as a principle.
I simply followed the instructions I was given
when I was trained as a soldier by teachers paid by the Chilean State.
I know what you're feeling.
What?
When torturing, the promise of pain is much more powerful than actual pain.
Because during that agonizing wait, the imagination runs wild.
What are you going to do to me?
Stick something cold in you.
He won't bite me.
He won't bite me.
He went out hunting for hearts that night.
-It was me. -No.
It was me who went out hunting for hearts that night.
It was him. He dressed as the captain general.
That was me. I wore his uniform. Me.
I did it to scare your children into coming here.
-To do what? -Kill him.
My general wants to die, but he cannot.
Why not?
Someone doesn't want him to die.
Who?
I don't know… who.
You want my children to kill the general since you can't do it yourself.
I can't kill him. He bit me.
You want to keep his fortune and steal his woman?
Who is his woman?
I am.
It's me.
Not anymore. It appears he's in love with a young French accountant.
My general is fond of fine horses.
Excuse me.
I adjure you, Satan, prince of this world,
acknowledge the power and might of Jesus Christ.
He who defeated you in the desert,
vanquished you in the garden, robbed you on the cross.
And by rising from the tomb, bore off your prize to the kingdom of light.
I order you, Satan, deceiver of mankind,
to leave this creature of God, whom you have left an evil seal on.
Leave this man whom God has anointed to be a holy temple.
FINAL REPORT PINOCHET FAMILY
Me.
With these documents and this money, the Church could extort the Chilean army,
the Chilean government,
and also the businessmen who nobly donated their money, jewelry, and cash
to help Mom.
But Carmen is just a child. A brat.
She has a perfect mind.
Beautiful and criminal.
She's better than I.
She came to steal.
That bitch.
-Bitch. -I told her everything.
She's going to steal it. All of it. That's not what he's saying.
-She's going to blackmail us. -No, you idiot.
She'll steal from us. Humiliate us. She'll blackmail the rest.
-Was that the only copy? -We'll have to check her room.
And the money? Where is the money? Did anyone check her suitcase?
-I don't get it. -She's going to kill him.
-The nun. -And they'll blame me.
She brought stakes and silver hammers.
-Plus holy water and some weird crap. -What?
She brought stakes and silver hammers.
-Are you deaf? -She won't kill me. She won't.
I was tricked once. I won't let it happen again.
-And Mom? Where is she? -Off with Fyodor.
She won't kill me either. I won't let that little brat kill me.
You have to kill her. I can't. My general would kill me first.
You're more loyal to him than to me? Let me bite you.
-No. -Now. Let me bite you now.
I am the queen here.
Stop fooling around.
I am a foreigner to this century. And to you, I am eternal life.
If you're going to bite me, I want you to kill the general first.
Excuse me.
I want you to win a war for me--
What?
Let me… go!
Margaret?
I don't know. I haven't a clue. I just met her. We're going on vacation.
It's nice to see you. I thought you were dead.
But I see there are still ancient people around, like me.
Because… she's my sweetheart.
No.
You goddamn old tramp.
I always knew you were after my husband.
You bit her?
You only just met this thief, and you bit her?
Don't be a nag. You reek of Fyodor. I can smell him from all the way over here.
Traitor.
So Mom's never going to die either? And now Carmencita.
We're screwed. We have nothing. What?
If Dad doesn't die, we'll never get anything.
And if they kill each other?
-Why would they do that? -Over the money?
No. They love and hate each other. They're a different species.
Why don't we kill them?
You're going to kill four vampires? I'm not killing Mom.
Marie Antoinette.
She's yours now.
Horrendous old man.
Penniless old man. Loveless old man!
What a pain in the ass. You have no idea how to win a war.
It's true what they say. Beauty and wits never go together.
Our Church must be resurrected, just like our Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen, Monsignor.
Once you finish the report, you will need to defeat Satan
and kill the vampire.
And if you find any document signed to the bearer
that may be of use to our Church, you take it.
Banks, account numbers, companies, documents signed by important people,
ministers, businessmen, whatever… let them talk.
All right.
Okay, shall we?
Dad?
Dad.
What a pain in the ass, man.
Shall we?
Dad?
Dad?
ARK
[Pamela] God. I'm scared. This is not naked, I hope.
[on TV] Baby, I'm recording you.
I love my Pamela.
[Pamela] Your Palema?
I didn't know I had all these tapes here.
[Tommy] The very incredible Pam.
-[Pamela] Baby. -[laughs]
[Tommy] Oh, this is awesome.
Oh my God.
Baby, you're ruining it with a cigarette.
-[Tommy] Yeah. -You've been shunned.
You're ruining it with your breath. My breath?
[Pamela] God, this is crazy to see.
[man] What is going on?
I don't know.
[man] Look at this guy.
[Pamela] Oh my God.
[man] Oh wow.
[Pamela] Wow.
Pamela, I have said it before, and I'll say it again.
I have waited my entire life to meet a woman as wonderful as you.
I've only ever wanted to be your knight in shining armor.
So here I am.
Come, my angel, take my hand.
Would you marry me again?
[crowd] Bye!
[Tommy] Bye, guys.
Tonight, June 1st--
Hearing the tone of my voice, I was happy.
When I saw those videos, I got so emotional 'cause I thought,
that was it, that was my time to really be in love.
Right now, I feel like it's almost like I'm looking for something.
[Tommy] Whoa, baby. You look so beautiful.
[Pamela] And I really don't know where I'm gonna go next. I feel restless.
I'm looking for a feeling I can't find.
Please welcome Pamela Anderson!
Pamela Anderson is this generation's sultry sex goddess.
[anchor 1] Hollywood and the blonde bombshell.
[Conan] International superstar from her role on Baywatch…
[anchor 2] …is perhaps the most famous blonde on the planet.
Whether she's racing across the sands of Malibu in her red lifeguard suit,
or posing on the cover of Playboy.
I'm Pamela Anderson, Miss February 1990.
[Jon] You do the Playboy and Baywatch. The whole exploitation angle, do you worry about that?
-No. -[Jon] Fair enough, let's move on.
[paparazzi] Tommy, Pamela, turn around!
[anchor 3] Pamela wed Tommy Lee four days after meeting the Mötley Crüe drummer.
[Larry King] Why do you think printed materials are so obsessed with your sex or love life?
[Pamela] Maybe the tape had something to do with it.
[anchor 4] That infamous sex tape stolen from their home.
[Letterman] How many times have you been married? You've married four times?
One man can't do it all.
[Pamela] If they've heard any of the tabloid rumors,
it paints a whole idea of another person and who I am.
So hopefully, I can only surprise people.
-[Larry King] You're not an actress? -[Pamela] No.
-[Larry King] What are you? -[Pamela] I don't know yet.
-What do you wanna be when you grow up? -You tell me. I don't know.
[Pamela] Hi, Mom.
[Pamela] I'm here.
I'm living in the house that I grew up in, which is triggering and crazy,
just like marrying a rock star.
It's like coming home to this nutty place where, you know, my childhood happened.
Okay, good girl.
I've always come home when I have some kind of trouble going on,
and I always kinda know what I'm doing when I leave.
It's, like, the truth serum.
You sit in the middle of that field,
you look at the stars,
and everything comes to you.
This is not an easy beach to film. This is not California.
Believe me, I can't run in slow motion on this beach.
April 1st, my dad would pick me out of bed,
put me over his shoulder, and throw me in the water. Like, happy April Fool's.
That was the first day we were allowed to be in the ocean, swimming.
And we had to swim, April 1st, and it is freezing here.
And see where the brick wall is? That's where my house was.
It was a tiny little shack.
[Pamela] My mom was a waitress, and she worked at Smitty's Pancake House.
But my dad was a poker player,
con man, chimney sweep with a top hat and everything.
Everyone has a story about my father, the notorious bad boy of Ladysmith.
My dad liked to race cars.
And my mom has a scar across her whole forehead. because her head went through the windshield while pregnant with me.
And we like to joke that's probably the reason I'm a little bit crazy.
[woman] I love the island.
Living by the water.
People are very friendly.
Ladysmith is a beautiful little town.
And Vancouver Island is the place to be.
Pamela was born July 1st, '67.
She hit the paper the minute she was born.
Pam was the first centennial baby.
So they issued medals for babies born that day.
[man] Pamela was always at the store.
And I'd go up there and they would say,
"That'll be $50 for Pamela's bill."
And I says, "Bill? What bill?"
She says, "Well, she charges up chocolate bars here and puts it on the tab." [chuckles]
She was a little rebellious, all right.
[Pamela] My parents were married
I think when they were, like, 17 and 19, when Mom was pregnant with me.
So they were just still raging.
And my dad drank a lot.
They fought quite a bit.
A lot of name-calling and physical abuse too.
My mom was vacuuming during a hockey game.
So my dad picked up the vacuum cleaner, and threw it over her head,
over the thing, onto the beach.
No vacuuming when there's hockey on.
I just kinda knew when to take my brother out. We just had to wait for them to stop screaming,
then we'd come in and they'd be, like, up against the wall, or on the table,
just kissing, or throwing themselves in the room, slamming the door,
and we thought, "Okay. Well, that's better."
Felt like the same energy, though. [chuckling]
[Pamela] We ended up leaving my dad a couple times.
We were living in an apartment and we were living on welfare.
Powdered milk, all the… I just… I can taste the powdered milk right now.
I remember when my dad called. There was mail by the phone.
I gave him the address where we were, and he came and got us and we moved back to the island.
Then they didn't wanna move back to Ladysmith,
too many bad memories, I guess, for my mom, so they just moved a couple towns up. [chuckling]
So, there. She put her foot down.
But I realized no one has a perfect childhood.
I had some horrible things happen when I was little.
I had a babysitter.
And my parents thought she was a great babysitter 'cause she brought presents all the time,
but she was molesting me.
It was, like, three or four years of abuse.
She always told me not to tell my parents.
I tried to protect my brother from her.
I tried to kill her.
I tried to stab her in the heart with a candy cane pen.
And then I told her I wanted her to die. She died in a car accident next day.
So, I thought I killed her with my mind and I couldn't tell anybody.
But I was sure that I did it. That I wished her dead and she died.
I lived with that my whole really young life.
When those traumatic moments happen, I would just leave my body
and float away, and I'd make my own little world.
I was digging a hole to China, thinking, "I hate this, I hate this. I wanna get outta here."
I just thought I had to get off the island.
As I got older, I was, like, a little tomboy.
I was a gymnast and so I was tiny.
I bloomed very late.
Then I got one lump on my chest,
and I was rehearsing for a long time how to tell my mom I was dying of cancer.
'Cause I thought it was cancer, I tried to pound it back into my chest.
And when I finally told her, she laughed and said, "Oh, you're becoming a woman."
Then everything was like, bam, bam, bam, and then crazy from there.
And so it began. [chuckling]
And now here we are. More than two lumps later. [laughing]
Oh my God.
For some reason, when I was traveling around the world,
everything that was important to me, I sent here. I figured one day I'd get here.
But I didn't realize it was gonna be so soon 'cause now I'm here surrounded by my stuff.
I kept diaries and stuff from my childhood and all the events in my life.
There's just tons of yellow legal pads. I mean, basically, my life is all yellow legal pads.
I wanted to write things down in case I forgot them.
So I wrote down things thinking,
if something were to ever happen to me, that there'd be evidence.
Sometimes I was writing like that, and sometimes I was writing out my feelings,
not thinking anyone would ever see it.
[director] Since you've given us your journals,
I was wondering, are you open to reading them in the film?
Or what are you thinking about that?
I don't know if I want to go there and read them.
I don't even think I'll watch this documentary.
I mean, I just don't… I like to do things just for the experience of doing it.
I wanna move on with the next part of my life.
So, it might give you more access if you have somebody else read them
because I might say, "I don't wanna read this or that." So, it's just, like, you can… you have my permission.
So, it's just, like, you can… you have my permission.
It's tough to go through it again 'cause you go through it again like you're going through it for the first time.
It's… it's painful.
[Pamela] "I'm glad I got this diary." "It should really help."
"Maybe I'll write a book one day."
"I love words."
"They send me leaving this ludicrous situation behind."
"Come with me. I'm paving the way."
"The world opens when I write."
"In school, I always wrote stories about parents deserting their children."
"I must have been hurting a lot."
"Life keeps playing tricks on me."
"I try to find ways to be seen amongst the nonsense."
"I know everyone creates their own level of drama in their lives."
"Some more than others."
"I guess you could say I'm very creative or very dramatic."
"Who knows?"
"XO, Pamela."
From the beginning, I've been drawn to different types of bad guys.
One of my first boyfriends,
he had a habit of trying to chase me and run me off the road.
Like, run me over if he saw me.
He kicked me out of a moving car,
and I did a gymnastic dismount into a ditch.
So… things that come in handy.
After I graduated, I wanted to see what was over in Vancouver.
And when you grow up on an island, the mainland is a very scary place.
And my mom would say, "You can't go to Vancouver 'cause someone got shot in Texas."
I was like, "That's pretty far away from Vancouver."
And she'd go, "It's all attached. Don't go to the mainland!"
I went on the ferry, and I got there, and eventually I met somebody.
I moved in with him,
and he was having an affair with somebody.
When you see your boyfriend washing his penis in the sink, that's a sign that they're probably having an affair.
And I wrote down, "Washing penis in the sink, suspicious."
Looking back, it's funny. In the moment, you're horrified.
My girlfriend had friends who were Labatt's beer representatives
and they had free tickets to a football game.
BC Lions, Canadian football.
And I didn't even wanna go.
I mean, I wasn't interested in football, but she really wanted to go.
So we went to the stadium, and we're all wearing the Labatt's beer T-shirts.
The cameraman zoomed in on me, and put me up on the jumbotron.
And I remember seeing it going, "Oh my God, that's me." I couldn't believe it.
And my friend that was with me worked for Labatt's and he said, "Stand up and show your T-shirt."
So, I stood up and they had me kind of going back and forth on the jumbotron.
They brought me down to the 50-yard line and they asked me to do a draw.
So I had to pick a number out of a bowl.
And I remember looking up and thinking,
"It looks like a million eraser heads in the stands." Like, it was just huge and just…
[Pamela] They started calling me the "Blue Zone Girl."
And then Labatt's reached out to me to do a commercial for them.
And a poster.
Then it was on Monday Night Football ads, and then it was all over the place.
Not too long after that my phone rang and I picked it up.
This woman says, "It's Marilyn Grabowski from Playboy, and we want you to be on a… some cover."
And I was like…
"Playboy?"
And she goes, "Yes, we've been looking all over the world
for this October '89 cover and we think it should be you."
I was like, "You think it should be me?" "So is it for real or is it not?"
She goes, "It's for real, guaranteed."
[Pamela] And then they were going to get me down to LA, but I'd never been on a plane before.
And so I had my problems at the airport.
And they said, "What are you doing in LA?" And I said, "I'm posing for Playboy!"
And I remember showing them my letter I got from Hefner, and they were like,
"Oh no, no. You're Canadian, you can't work in America."
And I was like, "What?"
So I went in the bathroom, I changed my clothes, I put a hat on, and I went to another airline.
I get there, and the same lady was there like this, like, "Nice try."
I was like, "Oh my God."
So the only other way to get through, get on a Greyhound bus.
And sometimes they check you, sometimes they don't across the border.
It really made me nervous.
But they only checked the person in front of me and behind me.
So I got into America, to Seattle.
Then the next morning I got on the plane and they got me down to LA.
"Arriving."
"Off the plane, big city LA."
"I go straight to the guy holding the bunny sign."
"Very low-key."
And I landed on gay Pride day.
So I called my mom and said,
"Gay people exist, they walk around handcuffed together in pink hot shorts."
She goes… [gasps] "You've arrived." [laughing]
"I get out of the limo, out of the front seat of course."
"I thank him way too much for letting me sit up there."
"There was no one to talk to in the back."
The limo pulls up around the fountain and they bring you in.
The Playboy Mansion is like a castle, basically.
"Marilyn rushes out,
looks me up and down."
"I'm sure she's going to say, 'Go home.'"
"I'm a mess."
"But she tells me they're so happy I'm here."
"I'm lost in amazement."
"Fifteen-foot posters of naked women all up and down the halls."
[Pamela] The environment was the sex, drugs, rock-and-roll kind of underground art world.
And… But I thought to myself, I think I knew who this person was.
Is that Tony Curtis? Was that Scott Baio and Sean Penn?
And just beautiful women in long silk gowns, like Monique St-Pierre with the cropped hair,
kind of like Michelle Pfeiffer.
"A girl goes running by in a bathrobe, giggling."
"Then another one comes out and chases her with a glass of champagne."
"Wow, gorgeous."
"I feel very average at this point."
I was there in my acid-wash jeans, my Nirvana T-shirt,
and I was obsessed with those socks with balls on the back.
"It looks like they're going to have to color my hair."
I got that Sun-In stuff and I had sprayed my whole head with it as much as possible
'cause I wanted a few highlights,
and my hair basically turned into the color of a manila envelope.
It was not a pretty color.
So when I got to Playboy, that's the first thing they did.
Put my whole hair in tinfoil and everything just to make it look like a natural kind of color.
"This is definitely as blond as I've ever gone, but I'm thankful."
"I feel blessed and embarrassed at the same time." "What am I doing here?"
When I was young, I was painfully shy.
I hated my body.
I remember seeing Playboy magazines, my dad had them.
Hidden under his Donald Duck comic books,
but I saw them and I thought, "God, these women are so beautiful."
"Like, why don't I look like that?"
And I always thought girls were beautiful and guys were beautiful in school,
but I never thought I was one of them.
And with the things that I went through as a kid,
I had so much shame about my body, so much shame about what had happened to me.
[Pamela] "I was 12, 13-years-old with my friend."
"She had a crush on a guy much older than us."
"We went to a friend's condo."
"She went upstairs with the guy she had a crush on."
"I started to play backgammon with her friend downstairs while I waited for her."
"We played for a while until he said I looked like I needed a massage."
"He was 25, I was 12."
"He raped me."
"I felt like it was my fault."
"My mom was always crying about my dad."
"I couldn't bear to hurt her more."
"I didn't tell her or anyone."
I tried to forget it.
I tried to forget it, but I felt like it was tattooed on my forehead.
Like, I really had this image of "I had sex" on my forehead
when I didn't want anyone to know that I had it.
Those were kind of my first exposure to sexual experiences too, so
I think a lot of confusion.
What it made me was very, very shy.
It made me super self-conscious.
[Pamela] When I got to that first Playboy photo shoot,
I just said, "Like, why am I so freaking paralyzed by this shyness?"
"I'm so sick of all this past that's created this insecurity in me."
It's like a prison. I have to break out of it.
From the first snap of the picture, I felt I was throwing myself off a bridge
and falling in the… Just like snap!
That was the first time I felt like I'd broken free of something.
"Photo shoot."
"Shy at first, by end of the week, you had to stop me from running out the door naked."
[Pamela] "To the side. Am I doing this right?"
"I could kind of see myself from the camera's perspective in my head."
"Once I got it, I had a blast."
[Pamela] I just remember at some point when I was in the fountain splashing around and there's a little bit of nudity.
And I could feel, like, the silk, I'd pull it across my skin, then I would get goosebumps.
And I was like… Like, that's where a wild woman was born.
And I felt like it was kind of like a gateway to another world.
Now I was gonna take the power of my own sexuality,
and take my power back, and I did it I think in a really big way.
[Pamela] "I jumped all over the place, rolled around,
put my fingers in my mouth, and then my hair became my prop."
"After all, eventually that was my only wardrobe."
"And shoes."
"If I kept my shoes on, I didn't feel naked."
And then it clicked to me and I realized, "Oh, this is something I can do."
I felt like this is something that I'm good at.
Not that I'm good at good-looking, but I'm good at it.
This whole Playboy centerfold, gatefold is like playing a character for me.
And I've had a lot of fun doing it.
Playing a character. What would you do if you were a person in that situation?
But you are that person in that situation. [laughing]
I had been in LA for a few weeks.
And I thought, "Okay, I did it. I did Playboy."
"I'm going home."
But the next day Marilyn Grabowski took me for lunch.
She said that Hefner really wanted me to be a playmate.
I was like…
Like, I just couldn't… It was so much to absorb.
And she just said, "I think you should stay in LA." "I think you have a career here."
Would I consider it?
And I called my mom, she said, "Do it."
I told her to live her life. [chuckling] Be free.
I didn't do Playboy 'cause no one ever asked me. [laughs]
[Pamela] "Dear diary, I'm way out in the boonies."
"I have to take three connecting freeways to get into Hollywood."
"The price you pay for clean air."
"I like driving here."
"Everybody seems to know where they're going and want to get there fast."
"Even the grannies go 80."
"That's miles per hour."
[Pamela] "I got my new dog, Star, today."
"He's going to be so loved."
I moved to a little apartment. I had one plate, one fork, one spoon.
No furniture, nothing.
I just sat there and thought, "Okay, well, this is it."
"There's really no way I should be here."
"Coming from a very isolated small town, an alcoholic father."
"I lived in an imaginary world."
"I certainly don't blame my parents for my upbringing."
"I'm grateful because I gained a lot of good qualities along with the bad."
"I'm a survivor."
"XO, Pamela."
Well, it used to be-- Don't think we need more.
[Pamela] No, these are nice, actually. These are a nice size.
These are not vegan, for sure.
[Carol] Where's all your nice-fitting dresses?
[Pamela] No one needs to see my body anymore.
[Carol] You can see right through that thing, I'll have you know.
Well, a silhouette is much thinner than the real thing. [laughs]
[Pamela] My mom always talked about beauty, hair, makeup, and all that stuff.
And she taught me how to color my hair from the drugstore.
That's, like, two minutes.
Everything in Ladysmith is two minutes away, with traffic.
Five dollars for a box. I do it for myself in 20 minutes.
Scandinavian blond, here I come.
Except for the blond hair, the boobs, and plastic shoes,
I am real underneath it all.
I've never sat across from an interview subject before and said,
"May we talk briefly about your breasts?"
What are they? Who are they? Those things I'm just tagging along with?
I always said my boobs had a career and I was just tagging along.
You wanna see them? No, I'm kidding.
No, you don't wanna see them now. They're in rough shape.
-Where'd I get my boobs done? -[anchor] Yeah.
Jesus, that's a personal question, but I'll let you… Let's talk about this.
I didn't know to lie or withhold anything in interviews.
So, when people would ask me if I had surgery or anything like that, then I'd just answer.
And so that just kind of set the ball rolling.
-You were not under-endowed, were you? -[Pamela] No.
I remember being in a gym at Playboy… at the mansion
and looking around at these women going, "God, look at the bodies on these women."
"I mean, this is just incredible."
I remember when I was with Kimberly Hefner, and she's married to Hefner.
She said, "Well, you know, they all had surgery."
And I was like, "Really? Where do I sign up?"
[Pamela] So that was it.
Choices in the moment. You know, not a lot of thinking went into anything.
I don't know why my boobs… people were so interested,
they weren't that newsworthy.
But I was just pretty naive.
And I think at the time, it was pretty nervy to say the truth.
When someone asked me, I said, "Yeah!"
Have you ever had work done?
Why, yes. These are implants, Larry. -Oh, they are? -[chuckling]
-[Larry] No… Are they or aren't they? -Yes, they are. [laughs]
It was disturbing 'cause it was, like, "Oh my God. Really?"
"Is this what we're talking about again?"
But you roll with it.
Yeah.
[Jay] Those are beautiful, uh, jewelry.
-Thank you. -[audience laughing]
So much has been written…
-She's looking at me… -You got your hands out like this.
-"So much has been written." -[Matt] I didn't mean to do that.
[Jay] Who would you wanna be, and why?
I could be you.
Why would you wanna be me? I'm curious as to why…
So I could torture you. Ask you about your implants.
Yeah, that'd work.
I don't see how it's so interesting.
I think it's kind of inappropriate to ask women those kind of questions.
There has to be some line that people don't cross.
I always hoped something would come along where I would do something
which would be more interesting to people.
You know, than my body.
I moved here when I started working for Playboy, so everybody that I've met
has been because I started working for Playboy.
So who knows? Maybe one day I could be an actress.
"May 21st, 1991."
"I'm making a plan of action for my career now."
"I think I stood back too long."
"This is my time to shine,
not as a sex symbol, but as an actress."
Playboy was kind of like my agent almost at that time.
Like, people were calling Playboy to ask me to do things.
And they called and said, "Would you come for an audition for Baywatch?"
It was about the California dream.
[David] I've been proud to be the star of a show called Baywatch,
a weekly series about the brave men and women called lifeguards.
[Pamela] They always tried to get me to come and audition in Marina del Rey,
which sounded very exotic and far away. [chuckling]
I was like, "That sounds really far, I can't go." I just ignored it.
Susie and I knew this was the girl. And she canceled on us 11 times, okay?
By the eleventh… And we kept going into these auditions with these guys saying, "Guys, there's a girl you gotta see."
They said, "Are you Pamela Anderson? Like, one famous never for showing up?"
And I said, "Yes."
And she just had so much energy and so much, uh, personality. She was the one.
[Pamela] So that's how CJ was born.
[man] And action!
[Pamela] Baywatch was my first, kind of, acting job.
I wouldn't say it was any good. I still didn't know what I was doing.
Oh my God, Mitch, I'm sorry. I was just so surprised to see you standing there.
Not as surprised as I was.
How are you, CJ?
How's Larry?
Mention that name again, you're going back in the river.
The notes of the director would say was like, "Pretend it's real. Action!"
Hold on!
Or if something wasn't working, they'd say, "More seagulls!"
The cracker-whacker would get out there and he had crackers in a little sling
and he would be slingshotting, like, crackers in the air.
[man] Scare the birds, please! Scare those birds!
[Pamela] We were having a ball. We couldn't believe we were working.
We were on the beach every day, getting paid for this.
We didn't realize on the show that it was becoming very, very popular.
When it comes to viewers, there's one show that's in a class all by itself.
It's the most popular television show in the entire world.
[Pamela] It was one of the first American shows shown in China.
[Katie] Baywatch is being dubbed in Mandarin, not that it really needs much translation.
[Pamela] You could watch that show with the sound off, actually.
[chuckling] It wasn't really about the storylines.
[anchor] And when it came to eye candy, no one was sweeter than Pamela Anderson.
[man] She turned slow-motion running into an art form.
The slow-motion run is really hard to… learn. [laughs]
[man 2] Her magnetism just radiated.
And we realized we had something in Pamela that was different.
[man] Pamela!
[Pamela] Going to Europe to promote Baywatch was crazy.
People were falling over backwards and falling down escalators.
I remember looking behind us going, "Well, who's here?"
[in French] I saw her! She's more beautiful than on TV!
[Conan] My first guest became an international superstar from her role on Baywatch.
Please welcome Pamela Anderson.
Please welcome Pamela Anderson.
Pamela Anderson.
[anchor] One of the most well-known stars in the world.
[anchor 2] The very lovely Pamela Anderson.
[Pamela] "Hi, Mom. It was nice to finally talk to you this morning."
"I hope this year's a great one for everyone in our family."
"Maybe soon, I can buy you guys a house."
"That is my dream."
"I'm going to work very hard to help that happen."
Faster, baby!
I've always had this property and I abandoned it for, like, 25 years.
So it was really rotten and decayed.
But I knew I'd have to come home when my parents were older to look after them.
And then COVID hit and I said, "Okay, I'm staying."
And then, of course, I got a little bored and thought, "I need to build this."
So the contractors came and I was like, "Oh, he's cute."
Darn it.
Then I got married Christmas Eve.
But he's a good Canadian guy. Normal.
I just felt like, maybe I need to try that.
Yeah.
Don't know.
Again, sometimes I don't know if I'm alive or dead.
[Pamela] But maybe this is just the time I was supposed to be home, I guess.
I'm like a spawning salmon, just coming home to die.
No, I'm kidding!
[Pamela] Terrible.
[Pamela] Nineteen-ninety.
What?
Oh my God, this is fun to read.
I was, like, making a cake for Mario's 33rd birthday.
That's a long time ago.
"January 8th, 1990."
"I miss Mario Van P."
"I just want to be loved by one person,
and I want to spoil that person rotten."
"I think I want that person to be Mario."
"I woke up at Mario's, and went home to change, went to Scott's…"
I'm sorry, that's weird.
Why would I even write that down?
'Cause God forbid you do a documentary one day in your life and find out what kind of a whore you are.
[Pamela] I dated a few other actors, but only for short periods of time.
Who else was I dating when I got there? There was quite a few men around.
Well, just… Well, Scott Baio.
Oh, I might buy a Hyundai.
Oh, off Scott's dad, for $5,000.
He was really mad because I would drive Scott's Mercedes
and he said I wasn't worth a Mercedes yet. That I had to drive something like a Hyundai.
He was… He was not very nice to me.
-[director] Dean Cain, did you date? -Oh God.
Yes, but I don't think we need to go through all those.
[director] Eric Nies?
[Pamela] Oh God. Yes, I was dating Eric Nies. I don't even know why it ended.
But you're very much in love now with a Frenchman. Mon dieu!
-[Regis] What's the Frenchman's name? -[Pamela] Um, David Charvet.
-[Regis] Charvet? -[Kathy in French accent] David Charvet.
This is it for you, you think.
-This is the love of your life. -Definitely the love of my life.
"December 18th, 1992."
"David isn't sleeping in the same room with me anymore."
"I know this is the end of us."
"I'll never get married. I know that now."
"Maybe I'll live with my parents when I'm old and we'll all die together."
"Well, Star is with me at least."
"We are finally off Baywatch until May."
"This hiatus from the show has been quite an adventure,
but I love shooting on the beach and in the ocean."
"It's me."
"Totally Pamela."
CJ Parker was based on me.
She was kind of like this hippie little romantic.
Mitch, I think I'm in love.
Oh no, CJ. Come on, not again. You just met the guy.
[sighing] I don't know. He just… he brings out feelings in me I never knew I had.
You say that every time.
No, this time's different.
I met Kelly Slater on the set of Baywatch.
He was my big love, actually.
He was such a sweetheart to me, and so good to me.
Oh, there's Kelly.
When he had hair. [chuckling]
So handsome.
Uh, he's definitely handsome.
I dated Kelly all the time. I mean, Kelly and I were together between lots of boyfriends
and lots of girlfriends for him too, but it wasn't just me.
Uh, I'd like to say thanks to, uh, my girlfriends and my…
my girlfriend and my friends.
[Pamela] He definitely was a heartbreaker.
I mean, he just was a free spirit. You couldn't get your hands around him.
But you don't own anybody.
Nobody owns anybody and you just, uh, let them be who they are. Sometimes it's better… not with you.
Sometimes it's better… not with you.
[Pamela] "I'd rather have loved for an instant than a miserable life."
"I love being in love and being vulnerable and being giving."
"It's the only way to live life."
"Vulnerable."
I love to live a romantic life every day.
I remember talking to Sylvester Stallone one time.
And he offered me a condo and Porsche to be his number-one girl.
And I was like, "Does that mean there's number two? Uh-uh."
He goes, "That's the best offer you're gonna get, honey." "You're in Hollywood now."
I wanted to really be in love. And I didn't want anything less than that.
[man] Say hi!
[Pamela] I was part owner of this club called Sanctuary.
It was New Year's night, and I was with my best friend, Melanie.
-[Pamela] Melanie! -Hi!
[Pamela] Tommy was there.
[anchor] Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee.
[anchor 2] Rocker Tommy Lee.
[anchor 3] The Mötley Crüe drummer with the bad-boy image.
[Pamela] I gave everyone a Goldschläger shot to celebrate,
but Tommy thought it was only for him, so he came bounding over everybody
and sat next to me and licked the side of my face.
And I licked Melanie's face, and it went all the way around.
After that night, the phone wouldn't stop ringing.
And he was leaving messages saying,
"My Bologna has a first name, it's L-A-R-G-E."
[Pamela] I didn't answer him back.
I was so busy at that time, and I just was shooting every day.
I was shooting Baywatch and shooting for Playboy.
But I was out the door one day when the phone rang,
But I was out the door one day when the phone rang, and it rang again, I was like, "Oh, shoot. Maybe it's my agent."
He goes, "Hello?" I was like, "Tommy?"
And he sounded really sad, he goes,"Hi."
I said, "Hi. I'm so sorry. I kind of ditched you before." "But I just, you know, I'm busy right now. I'm going to Cancun."
He goes, "Without me?" And I said, "No, you're not coming to Mexico."
I go, "I'm going, I've got a photoshoot." And he goes, "Oh. I'll see you there."
I was like, "No, you can't come there." He goes, "No, no, I'll be there. I'll find you."
And I was like, "Shit!"
And when I got there, I told everybody,
"If anyone with tattoos comes near the hotel, don't let him in."
Well, we're in Cancun.
Un-freaking-real.
That is where we're going tonight, La Boom. It's somewhere over there.
And then Tommy was leaving messages. "I'm in Cancun now, this is my hotel. This is where I'm staying."
"I'm here with some buddies. I'm going hotel by hotel to find you."
And so I was nervous and then finally I went, "What could possibly go wrong?"
I said, "We leave tomorrow." "Let's call him and let's have one night with these guys."
Famous last words. "What could go wrong?" [laughing]
[Pamela] So then we went to La Boom.
So it's, like, super techno.
They were walking in, I was walking towards them. I looked at my girlfriend, "Which one's Tommy?"
They were all dressed in those white wifebeaters, chains, jeans.
They all looked the same.
And my girlfriend, Alexis, she said, "That one."
We had champagne and we put ecstasy in my champagne,
which I'd never tried before.
The pupils of my eyes were this big.
You know, I have light eyes. And I thought it looked so cool.
The rest is all a big blur.
All a big happy blur.
We felt pretty invincible.
Later on that night, he just looked at me and he goes,
"You wanna get married?" And I was like, "Yeah, I do."
And he goes, "Have you ever felt this way before?" I go, "Never. I've never felt this way before."
And he goes, "Okay." And he took his friend's skull ring off, put it on my finger, and that was it.
And he took his friend's skull ring off, put it on my finger, and that was it.
We were just hours in the booth talking, planning our wedding. [laughs]
[Pamela] "Tommy and I couldn't stay away from each other."
"I thought. Why not? Clean slate?"
"It will be an adventure."
"And from then on, it was a fantasy, my fantasy."
-[Tommy] Hey, lover. -[Pamela] Hi, baby.
[Pamela] People marry after knowing each other two years and go,
"Now I finally like you enough to get married."
Everyone changes every day.
So I think you have to be pretty brave.
[Tommy] Whoo! We're getting married today.
-I know. -[Tommy] What do you think about that?
Awesome!
[Tommy] Yup.
[Pamela] And so, after a few days together in Cancun, we got married.
[Tommy] Hey, lovely girl.
[Pamela] Some of the people that were hanging out with us at La Boom were our wedding party.
My maid of honor was somebody that we met in the club that night.
We were lying in lawn chairs, sipping Chi Chis.
And I got married in a bikini, and Tommy was in board shorts.
I'm the luckiest girl on the planet.
My beautiful husband.
Yum, yum, yum.
What's your problem?
I don't wanna be cheap or anything, but we should go get a bottle of vodka
because it's, like, eight bucks for one of these.
[Pamela] Well, what time is it? It's, like, quarter after three.
We've had two bottles of champagne.
-So we're out of vodka? -Ah! [in Spanish accent] Little baby Coronitas.
-[Pamela] Coronitas. -Coronitas!
And I remember asking, "What's our last name?"
He goes, "Lee." I go, "I thought it was Tommy Lee Jones or something."
He goes, "No! That's somebody else."
Baby doll.
I got your booty.
[Tommy] Hey, gorgeous.
[Pamela] What was different about Tommy is there was no secrets, no deception,
there was no game playing.
It was really just full-on heart-to-heart, explosive kind of love.
[Tommy] Yum, yum, yum.
That's my baby.
Look at those toes.
[Pamela] All sandies.
[Tommy] No, no, no. I like it.
No, leave it.
[Pamela] Kiss me.
Bye, Cancun.
But I was dating Kelly Slater at the time,
and I was supposed to go see him in Florida and meet his family.
My first phone call I told him I was married. He's like, "What?"
That was horrible.
And then from the plane back to LA, I remember going to Tommy,
"Do you eat eggs?"
[Pamela] We didn't know anything about each other.
And it ended up being one of the wildest, most beautiful love affairs ever.
[Pamela] We landed to so much paparazzi.
[Pamela] It was crazy.
Everyone was in shock. [chuckling]
[anchor] Pamela and Tommy marry after spending only four days together.
[anchor 2] A four-day courtship on the beaches of Cancun.
[anchor 3] Right now, Tommy and Pam could not be happier.
They're in newlywed bliss.
[anchor 4] Some have said that marriage to Pamela Anderson
will have a calming influence on the wild ways of rocker Tommy Lee.
-Soon, soon, soon. We wanna have babies. -Yes.
[Pamela] We're moving in today.
Whose are you?
Get up, sleepy.
I'm recording the whole thing.
Our bedroom.
Temporary drapes that close because of stalkerazzis.
We filmed everything back then.
We always had these camcorders.
Then you fill the tape, and put the tape away and label it, and then you get another and you label it.
But those were moments I'm glad we captured.
When are you gonna get me preggos?
I know.
I'm trying.
[Pamela] It was my first time at the Cannes Film Festival.
And we went there to announce that we were going to do Barb Wire.
Barb Wire was the only real movie role I had.
[anchor] Most press conferences here are with film critics
asking articulate questions about the art of moviemaking.
That wasn't the case at Pamela's though.
[reporter] Are you trying to get pregnant? And how many children do you want?
Well, how many do we want, baby? Two or three.
-Two or three kids. -[Tommy] Two.
Two. Yeah, but we're working on it.
This whole Barb Wire was crazy before we shot one bit of film.
But after the Cannes Film Festival,
they changed everything because they thought this is gonna be huge.
So they switched directors and they switched storylines, and I don't even know what that movie's about.
I have no idea.
-[man] Rolling. -[man 2] Rolling.
And action.
I should blow your head off right now.
I had the BWV, the Barb Wire Voice.
I really just tried to talk very low.
Don't call me babe.
I was like, "Oh God, that sounds terrible."
I was shooting all the time. I was shooting Baywatch during the day,
Barb Wire at night and on the weekends.
[Tommy] What's up?
But then during the filming on Barb Wire, Tommy and I found out that I was pregnant.
[Pamela] We were making our nursery.
[Pamela] We just were so excited.
How cute!
We never had a baby before, so I've gotta see how this is gonna… how this is gonna change my life
and… and take up my time.
Everyone was like, "Well, we know you're pregnant,
but you still have to kickbox in that 17-inch corset,
and you still have to work 18 hours a day."
That's business, what you have to do, and I said, "I can do this."
[Tommy] There they are, hard at work.
[Pamela] I just feel fortunate I'm doing a movie in my career, so… I mean, I'd like to do more projects.
"I'm so excited about my career."
"I'm wanting it more now."
"I'm going to be the best actress I can be."
"I won't give up."
This is real challenging, it's a real demanding role, and, you know, you can really only work so hard.
And your body can only take so much.
And on the set, there was a time I wasn't feeling too well.
She came in and she looked horrible.
She was pale and shaking so bad.
[Pamela] I ended up in the hospital, and they told us we miscarried.
[Pamela] I remember, Tommy slept in the hospital bed with me.
We just were completely devastated because we really wanted to start a family.
When we were leaving the hospital, paparazzi were following us,
When we were leaving the hospital, paparazzi were following us, and we were definitely a little bit out of our minds.
Tommy was trying to evade the paparazzi.
Starting to, like, swerve, like, "We're not getting anywhere."
I'm talking to him, "Please, please stop." Then I'm like, "Ah, screw it!"
And then I slam the door open and my door hit that paparazzi's driver door.
I just snapped.
We jump on the car, and Tommy's putting his boot through the windshield.
It was crazy.
We were just like, "Everybody, stay away from us."
Emotionally, I was really upset after that and went back to work.
You know, that was… that was the hardest part, was just trying to get back into the film and get back into the groove.
This is when all those rumors came up, you're on drugs--
Well, I had a miscarriage.
-[anchor] Barb Wire did not do well. -[Pamela] It didn't do well, no.
[anchor] So, in many ways, your first failure.
[Pamela] It wasn't the box office hit everyone imagined.
But after the miscarriage, I wasn't really thinking about Barb Wire.
"I'm so depressed."
"I just did what was in front of me to numb the pain."
"I never got to deal with the grief of losing my first baby."
"I'm devastated."
-[Pamela sighing] It's why… -[Brandon] What's this?
[Pamela] Halloween party? This was before Dylan. This is… that's, uh, Tommy's 37th.
-I don't want… -No, you don't…
-Does it have to be on another setting? -I'm sure it does.
[Pamela] It's three. In the old days it was three.
-[Brandon] One time for three. -[Pamela] There it is.
-[Brandon] Let's push play. -[Pamela] Okay. I guess.
[Tommy] Merry Christmas.
[Pamela] Merry Christmas.
[Tommy] We're at Mainsborough Hotel where we're staying and having a fucking blast.
Whoa! A double-decker!
[Pamela] I have that shot so many times.
[Tommy] I just paid, which is, um…
[Pamela] We're learning all about beer, and this is what I'm having.
-[Tommy chuckling] Well, that's good. -[Pamela] Water!
Videotape me preggos. You haven't videotaped my preggo belly.
-[Tommy] Bust it out, baby. -[chuckles]
[Pamela] We got pregnant again.
I was so happy.
[Pamela] Today's not a good day. I feel sick.
Every other day I've been feeling fucking great.
No filming Pamela on those days.
If Mommy doesn't get her tea, she'll yell at me.
[Pamela] Well, you're drinking, so I'm already mad.
I kissed him and I just didn't know what happened.
I kissed him and I just didn't know what happened. [Tommy] Kiss me, kiss me.
[Pamela] "Tommy."
"He is love, sex, rock and roll,
sweet,
don't forget talented, romantic,
and a bad drunk."
Crown me.
[Pamela] "We are reckless and hopeful,
and may just have a unique way of living that's right for us."
[Pamela] Fish and chips with vinegar.
-What do I do with these? -[Tommy] Put them over your boobies.
[Tommy] Whoa, baby!
[Pamela] That's about the size of my nipples.
[Pamela] I love you.
I love you.
[Pamela] How much?
Yeah.
Bye.
Press the fader.
Now press… No.
Now do your thumb.
Baby, look what you did to me.
[Pamela] "March 20th, 1996."
"I wonder how our life will be."
"I can't wait to play with our little baby."
[Pamela] Dad's already drinking beer. -Dad's already drinking beer. -[Pamela laughs]
Yep, 'cause Dad's fucking stoked right now.
[Pamela] That's me!
Brandon's in there. I can see my belly button right there.
"I feel Brandon moving."
"It's wild."
"I have a little person inside of me, depending on me."
"I love him so much."
"I will be the best mother ever."
All the paparazzi dudes are out there.
They suck.
Go film the paparazzis, they were all around our house.
Hanging from trees. They're waiting for the baby to be born.
[Dylan] That's insane.
Yeah, it was awful.
Someone's gonna be a daddy in a couple days.
We're having Brandon tonight!
June 1st.
"I'm aching with excitement."
[Tommy] Is he coming, baby?
[Pamela] I don't know.
"The wildest experience of my life is about to take place in our home, in our bedroom."
"The birth of our beautiful child, Brandon Thomas Lee."
[Tommy whispering] Hey, Momma. [whispering] Hi, baby.
[Tommy] Congratulations.
Baby, we made a burrito.
Seventeen hours of natural labor.
[Tommy] Hi, Brandon.
-[Pamela] Hey, now, hey. -[Brandon cooing]
[Tommy] It's Daddy and Mommy.
-[Pamela] Look, he's playing with Daddy. -[whistling]
[Pamela] Baby, you're a daddy.
[Pamela] It's a whole new life now.
[Tommy] He was born at 3:05.
[Pamela] 3:02, I think.
It was very late, that's all I know.
[Pamela] It was such a really happy time in my life.
But we didn't realize everything was about to change.
[Tommy] Okay, say bye, guys.
Bye.
[Pamela] We're slowly getting it done.
[Tommy] The koi pond.
[Pamela] We had construction going on in the house.
And in the garage, we had a safe the size of a refrigerator.
It was a gun safe. It was behind a carpeted wall.
And Tommy had all his guns in there, I had, like, the bikini I got married in,
I had all the corks from every champagne bottle saved in there.
Corny stuff like that.
[Tommy] Hey, your radness.
[Pamela] We were in the house one day
and Tommy went to get something out of the safe.
And then he came up and goes, "Okay, this is a joke, right?" "Like, who-- Where'd you put the safe?"
And he was looking at my assistant, John Roberts, at the time.
And John was like, "What are you, crazy? I have no idea."
And then we went down there and it was gone.
[Pamela] I didn't know what to do. I called 911.
We filed a police report.
But nothing happened.
We had no idea when it was stolen
because we had construction going on at our house for quite a while.
It could've been stolen in a six-month time period,
so we had no idea that it was missing.
We didn't have any idea that anything in there
was gonna be something that would hurt us.
Baby, I'm recording you.
But then, one day, we got something in the mail. It was wrapped in brown paper.
Tommy opened it.
It was a VHS tape.
Tommy, he told me to go upstairs, and he watched it.
And I didn't watch it. I've never watched it.
Later, he came upstairs and he goes, "This is gonna be disturbing."
"This is a VHS tape of us having sex."
Oh my God.
We realized they have our home videos. That's the "Oh shit" moment.
[Pamela] We were newly married.
I love you, Tommy.
I love you!
[Pamela] We just were naked all the time and filmed each other on vacations.
This was just us being goofballs.
-You know, honking a horn with his penis. -[horn honking]
[Pamela] Talented man.
What they did is they found all the nudity they could from different Hi8 tapes,
and they spliced it together.
Where's Daddy?
But we had no idea who sent the tape.
Here we go. Caught on tape.
If anybody is watching this, go to hell.
If anyone steals this tape, you're going to hell.
So I'd turn it off and send it back to the original owner.
-[phone ringing] -[Pamela] Brandon.
Not too long after that…
[Tommy] Hello.
[Pamela] …we got a letter from Bob Guccione from Penthouse.
He offered to buy it from us.
He said, "I'll give you five million in cash for the rights to this tape."
We said, "Fuck you. Give us our tapes back."
This was not supposed to be for anybody else.
We just really had no clue. We thought that if we got the tape back, it would stop.
We had no way to navigate it 'cause no one else was going through anything like this.
You know, so we didn't really have the playbook on how to,
you know, get it all back, or make it go away.
Couple weeks later, Tommy watched the news and he came up and goes,
"Okay, this is gonna be upsetting to you."
He told me that there's this girl at Tower Records impersonating me,
some porn star outside signing copies of the Pam and Tommy tape.
We saw it all over the tabloids, the newspapers.
The tape is out.
Such an invasion.
We're angry and hurt and upset.
[Tommy] We feel very violated.
Some psycho decided to mass produce it and put it all over the world.
Do you have any remorse for exploiting celebrity or non-celebrity lives?
No, no. I mean, I… I don't feel like we've… we've done anything negative.
[reporter] Pamela, can you stop? Can you stop?
[reporter] Pamela, please have a word…
[Pamela] After that stolen tape came out, we were under a lot of stress.
There was paparazzi everywhere.
It was our first night out after I had Brandon.
And we went to The Viper Room. My parents were watching Brandon.
We were leaving, and the camera was right in my face.
-[man] Hey! -[Tommy] Fuck outta here!
[man 2] Hey, Tommy!
[Tommy] Fuck off!
[man 3] Tommy, get in.
[Pamela] Then we got pepper sprayed.
How dare you spray fucking pepper spray down my mouth! [man 2] We didn't spray anything.
You're a drug fiend. How dare you do that to me!
[man 2] Where's your child this time of the morning?
-With my mother! With my mother! -[man 2] Where's your baby?
Where is your baby?
With my mother! I'll fucking kill you.
You fucking asshole!
[man 4] You deserve it, Tommy. You're a fucking prick!
[Pamela] I think both of us didn't know how to handle any of it.
I mean, who knows how to handle something like that?
But we had to have some recourse, we had to do something.
We had to… we had to at least try to fight back because this was stolen out of our home.
And there's no way that people should be able to steal something from your home
and then sell it in front of the whole world.
[Pamela] A tape was stolen from Tommy Lee and myself.
IEG is now selling that tape worldwide illegally without my or Tommy's consent.
We have not received one penny or signed an agreement permitting them to merchandise this tape.
At some point, Ed Masry, he was the lawyer in Erin Brockovich,
he contacted us and said he would take it on.
And we said, "Sure."
Pam and Tommy were definitely the victims in this, uh, Pam and Tommy tape.
There's no question of that.
[Pamela] It's been exploited all over the world, and everyone's making money off it.
Especially at this time in my life, this is absolutely horrendous.
I really feel that… that we'll… we'll get them.
And they'll pay for this because this is illegal.
And I want to make it real clear
that Pam and Tommy turned down five million dollars cash.
They didn't wanna release that tape.
[Pamela] My fight is not for me alone, but for all celebrities whose privacy has been invaded.
I will continue to fight not only for myself and my children,
but also for legislation that would make what they're doing to me a crime.
It was a big case, it was a right to privacy case.
So it was an important case to set a precedent.
[Pamela] When the deposition started, I was pregnant again.
I was nervous that it was all gonna affect the health of our baby.
[Pamela] I didn't know that I was gonna be completely humiliated.
And I remember walking into the room. All these guys in there they had up naked pictures of me.
The lawyers basically said, "You're in Playboy, you have no right to privacy."
And that was a little bit shocking, but…
[Pamela] They would ask about my sex life.
And I kept on thinking,
"How am I getting questioned about my sexuality,
and my preferences, and my body parts,
and where I would like to make love, when it's stolen property?"
It made me feel like I was such a horrible woman.
I'm just a piece of meat. That this should mean nothing to me because I'm such a whore, basically.
They didn't have a lot of sympathy, you know, for me.
They're all, "Oh, she's in Playboy, she likes being naked in public."
First of all, it was my choice to be in the magazine.
Playboy was empowering for me.
But in this case, it felt like a rape.
Not to bring up something really heavy from my childhood,
but when I was attacked by this guy, I thought everybody would know.
When the tape was stolen, it felt like that.
And the depositions were so brutal.
I remember looking at them thinking, "Why do they hate me so much?"
"Why do these grown men hate me so much?"
I don't know how many days I was deposed, but they wanted me to come back and come back.
I just said to Tommy, I said, "I can't take it, I can't take it anymore."
And this would've been probably years of fighting.
I know some people would've fought to the death on it, but I'm pregnant.
I don't want this to affect the baby.
Tommy and I had a miscarriage first. We were scared that it could happen again.
We're not going to put Dylan's life at risk, 'cause it was just tearing me apart.
It absolutely devastated me.
But I just closed my eyes and signed the papers.
[anchor] The Lees dropped their lawsuit against cyber-sex company IEG.
IEG is now playing the video, which is spreading quickly,
IEG is now playing the video, which is spreading quickly, and is already available on many World Wide Web sites.
[Pamela] Well, this was the beginning of the Internet.
We weren't thinking about anything like that.
We had no idea that it was gonna go all over the world, you know, in an instant.
It really was the first viral video.
You can only sell so many fucking DVDs,
but when you open it up to the Internet, it's endless.
Really? The world's gonna see this?
[anchor] People from around the world joined the Internet to view the Anderson/Lee sex tape,
causing a cyber traffic jam on multiple websites.
-[anchor 2] Their most intimate moments… -[anchor 3] …took the Web by storm.
[anchor 4] Viewed by millions of strangers… [anchor 5] Private affairs are now a public record.
[Pamela] We never made a dime off that.
And I hate when people say that we settled.
We never settled on anything, we just told everyone to get lost.
If anyone watches it, if anyone buys it, if anyone sells it, it's just pathetic.
[Pamela] You can't put a monetary number on the amount of pain and suffering that it caused.
Well, jump on the bandwagon, everyone's making fun of us and--
Making fun? What? What are you talking about?
I'm shocked.
Pamela Lee-- Pamela Lee and Tommy Lee Pamela Lee and Tommy-- Pamela and Tommy-- Pamela and Tommy Lee…
[Pamela] I was the punch line of a lot of jokes on talk shows.
It was super humiliating.
-It's not funny. -[laughs]
It's not funny. This is devastating to us. Well, look…
-It is? -It is!
If they fall in love with you one way, that is it.
A sex tape and you're kinda of always gonna be that kind of image.
-[Howard] I have it on DVD. -[man] Yeah?
[Robin] Gotta get a clear picture.
Is it on DVD?
-It's on DVD? -[Howard] It is.
[Pamela] Oh, that's pathetic.
After that, it just felt like that solidified kind of the cartoon image too.
You become a caricature.
I think that was the deterioration of, kind of, whatever image I had.
[anchor] The world's most famous sex icon.
[anchor 2] Know my favorite part?
-Doesn't she have the prettiest vagina? -[anchor 3] A pussy taking a pounding…
[anchor 4] …image she cheerfully exploits on television…
[Pamela] It was different for me than it was for him.
Tommy is a rock star.
It all adds to the image of the craziness and everything.
But I knew at that point my career was over.
-I've always loved fairy tales. -Would you wanna be a serious actress?
-I am a serious actress. -[chuckling] I mean…
[Pamela] I was thinking maybe I could have a more serious career.
But had to kind of make a career out of the pieces left.
Then everything kind of blew up after that.
Yeah. I don't feel very good.
And I wanna articulate it the best I can because I… I mean, it's hard.
Sometimes you wonder why you're talking about it all again,
but, you know, it's part of what we're doing and…
It's good to get it out at least once or twice in your own words.
[laughs] In my own words.
[Pamela] I have romanticized the past.
So, I mean, now that we're talking about it, I could remember some things that were really big red flags.
But if I didn't think about it too much, I'd think our relationship was perfect.
Tommy comes by every day.
He's here every single day. He's basically moved into my trailer.
While I was on Baywatch, I would be in my trailer,
he would sneak in because it was his time with his wife.
Tommy was so jealous.
I thought it was cute.
I thought it was cute and I thought that was what love is.
Oh, that's so romantic.
"It's my last season of Baywatch."
"I had to kiss David Chokachi, but I didn't tell Tommy."
"He lost it."
"He came and trashed my trailer on the set."
"Put his fist through a cabinet."
"I apologized for not telling him,
lying, as he put it,
and told him it wouldn't happen again."
He would always know when to show up. He would look at the call sheets.
He would see what scene she was in.
He probably had access to the script, and would show up in the scenes where there could be an opportunity for him to get pissed.
where there could be an opportunity for him to get pissed.
[Pamela] The whole Baywatch crew, if they saw Tommy coming,
[Pamela] The whole Baywatch crew, if they saw Tommy coming, they would change the dialogue, change the scene.
He was always in my eyeline, he would always be behind the camera.
Tommy was always there.
It was too much, you know.
[Pamela] I was working, always working.
And we had two beautiful kids, so I was busy with them.
And I think Tommy went through a little bit of postpartum.
Hi, Dylan. Happy Valentine's Day.
-There's our flowers Dada got Mommy. -[Dylan cooing]
There was a terrible night when Tommy was just rocking on the floor.
Brandon was crying in the playpen and I was holding Dylan.
But Tommy was going, "I want my wife back. I want my wife back."
At that point, I didn't know what to do. And I just said, "I need some fucking help around here."
I said, "You gotta grow up. It's not about you anymore."
And I'd never spoken that way to him before. I'd never ever.
I didn't recognize him. He went black.
And then I started hyperventilating, scared.
Brandon was shaking and screaming, and holding my leg.
So I called 911, I put the receiver off.
[anchor] Lee was arrested at the couple's Malibu home and charged with spousal and child abuse.
He allegedly kicked his wife while she was holding the couple's infant son.
The injuries that they noticed to Pamela were an injury to her right hand,
a broken fingernail, and also bleeding to that hand.
They also noticed that she had redness to her lower back area.
Deputies offered her medical treatment, she declined.
[anchor] The rock musician was released on half a million dollars' bail,
but prohibited from telephoning or going near his spouse.
I… I miss my family very much
and, uh, you know, I'm very sorry that this is happening to us.
I never hit Pamela.
Grabbing, uh, a woman and shaking a woman is not… not cool either,
but that's… that's what was done.
[Leslie] Why would you do that?
I mean, what was it about your anger that would make you lash out physically?
[Tommy] It's a lot of pressure.
We've been going through a lot of stuff, sex tapes appearing, postpartum,
and two new babies.
Tommy comes third now, instead of first.
I don't know how to deal with that.
Just start stacking them all up and you got a guy who…
Really, the whole argument stemmed that evening
from me wanting some love.
[anchor] Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee was taken away in handcuffs
after being sentenced to six months in jail.
I'm happy that he took responsibility for this.
And I think it's the first step towards healing.
[reporter] Do you think he deserves six months?
[Leslie] What did you think, sitting in jail,
that Dylan, at six or seven weeks, was in Pamela's arms?
I mean, at six- or seven-weeks,
fate could have left you with one son instead of two.
Has that ever crossed your mind?
Not during it.
Afterwards, absolutely.
If you had the chance to apologize, would you apologize?
Oh, I have.
I have.
I apologized several times.
[Pamela] I tried to end the marriage, he didn't want to.
I mean, I have all the letters from him from jail.
Aw, picture yourself here and he had 'em all like…
Brandon, Dylan, Tommy, Pamela. [clearing throat] Yeah.
I'm sure I can't read these. These are gonna be way too much for me to read right now, but I don't know.
He really fought for us to stay together.
I mean, I had to bifurcate the divorce 'cause he wouldn't sign the papers.
He thought we could get through it. I just took my kids and was like, "No."
You know, it wasn't a gray area for me. It was, like, you can't do that.
Yeah.
"I've never loved someone so deeply."
"And by deeply, I mean, I loved his soul."
"I feel like part of me has died."
[Pamela] That's the San Fernando Valley over there.
[Brandon] Where are we?
That's when we were living in Wayne Gretzky's house.
Oh, no way.
[Pamela] Hi, baby!
Yeah. This is when I moved out, I guess.
I think Dad might've even been in jail at this time.
Terrible. I hate that. [sniffles]
-Night night, baby. -[Dylan squealing]
[Pamela] There he is.
[laughing] Dylan looks like a little doll!
Dylan. Smile, baby.
[Pamela] "October 11th, 1998."
"My little Dilly."
I can't see Dylan!
There he is. He's got a hat like Grandpa.
"I felt compelled to write to you, my little man."
"You've seen a lot in your nine months, and I wanted to write you
so one day you can read this and maybe understand
how we came to be where we are."
Oh, Dylan, you have not seen your baby stuff. Come here, come here!
That I have this. This is when we first moved into the house.
Say "I'm Dilly-do."
-I Dilly-do. -[Pamela] And I love you!
I'm, like, all cute, and Brandon's like a little devil.
-[Pamela] Oh yeah, I know you were. -[all laugh]
"Your daddy, Tommy Lee Bass, and I were married after knowing each other for four days."
after knowing each other for four days."
"Love at first sight."
This is his mobile on the Baywatch set, he likes…
[Carol] Mommy's bra.
[Pamela] Isn't that pretty?
"Mommy and Daddy will eventually be able to be friends, I hope."
"But I want you to know that I would rather be alone
than ever live with that abuse again."
"You will always be in a safe place."
It was challenging when Tommy and I separated and they didn't see their dad a lot.
I'm trying to sleep!
Now get out, you! [Pamela] You don't talk to Mommy that way.
-You warming your butt up? -Yep.
[Pamela] "Dylan, you are lying right next to me as I write this in Mommy's big bed."
"I love you so much, I'm crying."
[Pamela] "And with my tears, I've marked on your little forehead."
[Dylan] What?
[Pamela] Say goodbye to Lake Tahoe.
Here comes the private plane, on, um, Bob Seger's jet.
Yo, ho, ho, ho!
[Pamela] There's only one ho in here.
[Dylan] "There's only one ho in here." Oh, no.
[Pamela] "My mom taught me the most important lesson in life."
"When you are hurt, you have two options,
to close off, become bitter,
or love more, persevere."
"Love is the greatest healer."
"I choose love."
[Pamela] I always gravitated towards animals.
I just felt like I could trust animals more than people.
And since the stolen tape,
I've always questioned everything, everyone.
[Pamela] I didn't feel like I had a lot of respect.
"People always have projects for me, but they're usually very sexual roles."
[Pamela] And I sometimes get really caught up in being a caricature.
I catch myself living more like that than myself.
"I want more."
"I need more."
"I want to be proud of my accomplishments."
I was sick of talking about my boyfriends and my boobs all the time.
[Pamela] But I thought if I can attach it to animal activism,
or activism for the environment, then it meant something.
So I joined forces with PETA.
[anchor] This McDonald's has had meat-free burgers on its menu for a while,
so this is really nothing new.
But what is new is this huge PETA poster
of Pamela Anderson, urging New Yorkers to veg out.
Well, activism is sexy.
You have to be brave, and you gotta use what you got.
How's your show doing, VIP? You ever go over budget?
Yeah. Just not on my clothes or anything like that.
[Jay] No, you save money on those. Goes without saying, doesn't it?
[Pamela] I've learned how to deflect.
"Speaking of that, let's talk about…"
It's getting colder out, and people are, um, tending to maybe put on fur coats.
I don't think anyone would wear something they knew so much cruelty went into.
[anchor] In London, Pamela used a book signing to ask for signatures on a petition
to use fake fur on hats worn by the Royal Guards at Buckingham Palace.
For each autograph Pamela signed, she asked fans to return the favor
by signing PETA's petition to the queen.
[Pamela] Comedy Central asked me to do a roast and I said I'd do it
but only if they gave $250,000 to PETA.
We love you, Pam. Thank you for inviting me to do this.
Uh, thank you for agreeing to get fucked on camera one last time.
[Pamela] It was so raunchy. It was so not my kind of humor.
The reason I went through this was to benefit the PETA organization.
I wanna thank them for all their incredible work.
But I still got to talk about things that were important to me, so it was kind of a trade-off.
Media is powerful, and it is a tool.
I was already getting teased and made fun of.
I wanted to take that and use it for good.
[Piers] You made a surprising ally in President Vladimir Putin.
Well, I wrote to him and asked him to stop the importation of seal products
because this was 95% of the market
and that could potentially shut down the Canadian seal hunt,
which is one of my big goals.
So he did. He made it actually illegal to import seal products even into the country.
-[Piers] Right. -Yes.
-[audience laughs] -Any relationship with North Korea?
-Kim Jong-un? -No.
Not yet.
…a forward-thinking compassionate move.
I think that awareness and education is the most…
[Brandon] She wants to always use her voice for people
and animals that don't have a voice.
He's offered such an amazing and generous offer…
And it's definitely brought her into some controversial places.
[anchor] WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange could face the death penalty
if tried and convicted for publishing government secrets through WikiLeaks.
[Pamela] I met Julian Assange through my very good friend, Vivian Westwood.
[reporter] Hello, Ms. Anderson. How is he?
[Pamela] Every time I was in London, we talked for four hours.
I'd say, "The Internet's bad,"
and he'd say, "No, it's good 'cause you keep on learning everything you can."
"And then you can make an informed decision."
Lying, to me, is the most damaging thing people can do to people.
For me, it's just nice to know that someone's whole life is about truth and discovering truth.
He just believes in justice, believes in honesty,
believes in, um, exposing governments for what they're really doing,
believes in, um, exposing governments for what they're really doing, and people have the right to know.
[Brandon] I think she just doesn't have a problem with getting in trouble for these things.
You know, and I'm always like, "Please, don't do that."
We don't want this kind of attention anymore.
No. Like, let's just have some peace.
-How's the family? -Very good. The boys are great.
They've seen… have they seen pictures of you? Like in Playboy and stuff?
-No! -Oh.
[Pamela] I wasn't thinking when I was in Playboy that I was gonna have kids soon
and they were gonna grow up and it was gonna be embarrassing for them.
But I always thought I'll tell them, age-appropriate.
But I never got the chance.
You know, they always found out before I could really talk to them about it.
Dilly.
Dylan.
But a tape of your parents having sex is another level.
[Brandon] When I was a kid,
I thought everyone knew things about me and my family
that they never should've known.
And, like, everyone had this dirty little secret about my family.
[Brandon] I just remember in school, like, if anyone ever brought up my mom,
I was very quick to fight.
I would just flush with anger.
Sidekick, bottom fist, chop.
[Pamela] Whoa.
I remember one day after school,
Dylan coming to me in tears saying, "Mom, why did you do that tape?"
I was like, "Oh gosh, really?" We didn't make a sex tape."
-How did that tape get out? -It was stolen.
[anchor] Rumors began to circulate that Pamela and Tommy planted the video
to bolster their own publicity.
[Pamela] People actually thought we put it out there for some ridiculous reason,
'cause that became kind of a trend afterward for celebrities that were using a sex tape to become famous.
So kind of left us in that category.
And still to this day,
people say that we made money off it, which was never the case.
I never received a dime from that.
[director] Do you ever regret not having monetized the stolen tape?
Oh God, never! I would never monetize the stolen tape. I don't regret that at all.
You could give me hundreds of millions, a billion dollars, I'd never take it. Never.
Come on, Brandon, focus now.
[Dylan] I think it would've been a different story if she did cash in on the tape.
It just shows you, right?
Like, that thing guaranteed made people millions of dollars, and she was like, "No."
She 100% cared about her family being okay and me being okay.
Never cared about money.
I wish she made the money. She would've made millions of dollars if she just signed a piece of paper.
She would've made millions of dollars if she just signed a piece of paper.
Instead, she sat back with nothing and watched her career, like,
Instead, she sat back with nothing and watched her career, like, fizzle into thin air.
She was in debt most of her life.
Is it weird to feel like so many people are making money off of you?
I mean, you… you had a number-one video. You had lots of home videos.
You don't get a whole bunch of money from…
I never get anything from Playboy. Yeah.
[reporter] Never got money from the videos? No.
You're a very famous person, and everybody would imagine you'd have a lot of money.
Well, everyone-- A lot of people made a lot of money off me.
Yeah, that's true.
-[Howard] You're not good with money? -I'm not.
[Pamela] My friend David LaChapelle says I'm the least calculated person.
I just couldn't wrap my head around the business part of branding myself.
I'm not that person when it comes to money.
I just want my credit card to work and I wanna be able to get my nails done.
But for years I was always scared.
Give you my credit card, like, "Please, please, please work."
[Dylan] And I also think it's just she's so giving.
She's always supported everyone, grandparents, friends, and the family.
She's never worried about if she's okay.
She's always made sure everyone else is okay.
-Tommy Lee, how is he? -[Pamela] Great. We're like a family.
Like a little bit dysfunctional family, I guess, but, um, he loves his kids, and we love each other and--
-[Larry] So why can't you be together? -And, um, well, there's… Who knows why?
There's lots of complicated reasons, right? [chuckles]
That was a very long 18 years
of co-parenting. [chuckling]
-[Tommy] Go to first base. First base! -[Pamela] Good throw, Brandon!
It wasn't always easy.
And never has any partner of mine liked Tommy.
It was always, like, a jealousy.
So it never really gave us too much opportunity to be friends.
Hey Dilly, do wanna go behind the boat?
I wanna go in. [Pamela] You just wanna go in there?
Let Bob help you.
-[Dylan] I know how to do it. -[Bob] Let me help. I'll hold your hand.
[Dylan] I know how to.
I know how.
-Is this Detroit? -Is it Detroit? This is Detroit.
This is when we moved to Detroit. [laughs]
We moved to Detroit that point in our lives.
-[Pamela laughing] Ortonville. -[Dylan] By the way.
-How long were we there for? -Not long.
-[Dylan] Yeah, we… we left pretty quick. -[laughing]
[director] When did you live in Detroit?
-I was married to Bob. -When she was married to Kid Rock.
[reporter] What is special about Kid?
You see that?
[Pamela] Look at this, look at that, that's why.
That's it right there.
-Purely superficial, that's it. -[laughs]
-[Pamela] And I married Kid Rock. -[crowd applauding] His name is Bob Ritchie.
I take you, Kid Rock, to be my husband, my constant friend, my faithful partner, and my loving cowboy
my faithful partner, and my loving cowboy that I'll ride forever from this day forward.
There's Bob.
Bob and I and a pineapple.
We had a great time, we had fun together.
He was really good to the boys.
[Pamela] But I didn't feel like this is love
because I have an impression of what love is, and this isn't it.
We just didn't have that height, that frenzy I was used to.
I didn't want anything less than that.
I mean, we know you as someone who was married to Pamela Anderson.
The bottom line is, you know, I…
I… Yes, I… I touched the stove.
-The stove's very hot. -[anchor laughing] I think I'll not play with the stove anymore.
After we got divorced, I started thinking, "Maybe I should be married to a friend."
[host] Salomon calls.
What are you doing, kid?
[host] Rick Salomon, what are you doing?
[Pamela] Rick Salomon.
He's a professional poker player.
-I'm all in. -Salomon's all in, wow!
[Pamela] And then we got married.
And he ended up being a big drug addict.
We found a crack pipe in the Christmas tree.
He still to this day denies it. He says it's somebody else.
Who else would have a crack pipe in the Christmas tree? Wasn't me.
[chuckling] It wasn't me.
So we were only married a few months. It was annulled. But we're still friends.
It was annulled. But we're still friends.
Then, when he got sober and was sober for years,
we decided to try it again.
It didn't last long either.
[Dylan] She loves getting married, you know?
Maybe it's her favorite thing in the world is falling in love.
And then, like, I guess, loves the idea of falling out of love too, I guess.
[Pamela] I felt guilty 'cause of my kids, I wanted to show them a traditional relationship,
or a marriage, or a man that's consistent,
and giving them good examples in their life.
Only person I looked at as a father figure was my dad. And that was, like, it.
The other ones were just people who came in and came out.
-[Pamela] Oh my goodness. -I'm going to Daddy's house today.
[Pamela] Uh, tomorrow.
-It's been a while. -[David] It has.
-How long ago was it? -How many husbands ago was it?
-Exactly. -[audience laughing]
I'd go to the Playboy mansion and I'd see Smokey Robinson and he'd say…
I'd say, "Oh God. I got divorced again."
He goes, "Baby, you're a romantic. Keep on trying."
He goes, "You are my hero. I love it. I love it."
"Just keep trying. Some people get bitter, and you just keep going." [laughs]
[Pamela] When the kids graduated, I wanted to go to the south of France,
[Pamela] When the kids graduated, I wanted to go to the south of France, and so I went, and…
I met a professional athlete. He was very strong.
And he was very jealous.
[anchor] TV goddess Pamela Anderson has just released this disturbing video.
A French soccer star allegedly crushed her hands to the point of cracking.
[anchor 2] The soccer player denies all allegations, calling them completely false,
and said he was incapable of doing such things.
[Pamela] Just because you're in a relationship, if there's any abuse, or emotional abuse you don't have to stay in it.
if there's any abuse, or emotional abuse you don't have to stay in it.
Doesn't matter if it's your fifth marriage.
Doesn't matter what people think.
I'm attracted to these very hetero, masculine men.
Their initial attraction to me might be, oh, she's the Playboy thing,
or this kind of sexual thing, but I'm not the damsel in distress.
I am very capable, and some men hate you for being something else.
And then it can become violent.
For me, because I could leave at any time,
I used to always say, "I don't need to be with you. I want to be with you."
"And if I want to leave, I can."
And if I ever really stated those facts it made people more insecure,
and sometimes they start grabbing you by the hair and throwing you into walls,
and, like, stripping your clothes off.
Craziest stuff would happen.
It just touched some kind of weird part of a man, in my relationships anyway.
-Are you guys getting married? -Yeah.
-Again? -We're gonna try again.
[Pamela] My parents, they fought a lot, but they also made up.
My mom used to always say to me, "I feel bad. I set an example for you."
"I know your dad's an asshole, but I love him." "You don't love these assholes."
"Rip the Band-Aid off and just get rid of these guys
'cause you don't love them like I love your father, or like he loves me."
'Cause I would pick people similar, I guess, in some ways.
Maybe because of how I grew up and saw my parents
and maybe because of some of the relationships I had,
I didn't equate being in love with being nice, maybe.
[Brandon] You know what's the funny thing?
I'm hardwired to just be, like, the most, like, loving and insane person, ever.
You have to be insane to be in love. So…
Yeah, I know. You know what I say to all my girlfriends?
I go, "My mom tells me to be fearless to be in love."
They're like, "What the fuck does that even mean?" [laughs]
-Means you gotta be brave to be in love. -Yeah.
-[Pamela] As I record this… -[gasping]
[Pamela] …before the madness starts, happy birthday, lover.
Balloons, a thousand balloons for my baby.
A thousand purple balloons.
You have no idea what's going on.
-[Tommy] Hey, baby. -[Pamela] Look up.
[Tommy] Oh my God.
Baby?
This is fucking incredible.
That's your first present right there.
Happy birthday.
-[Pamela giggling] -[Tommy] I love you.
[Pamela] I love you, baby.
To us.
[Pamela] I think I need a break. Let's take a break.
-I can fear what's next. -[exhales]
So crazy. You know?
My parents were, actually, probably the two most insane people ever to live on planet Earth.
[Pamela] It's snowing! It's snowing!
[Brandon] I just know he was so happy too.
[Brandon] But I don't even remember that.
You know, like, 'cause by the time I was three, four-years-old, by the time I'm starting to remember things,
it definitely wasn't all, um, sunshine and rainbows.
[Pamela] There's two Greek words for love, like eros and agape.
Eros is more about passion and sex and crazy.
Agape's more commitment and supportive and that kind of love,
and they're two different words, where love is very conflicted.
[laughing] Hello!
Robert A. Johnson says, "Romantic love is not sustainable."
As soon as I read that I was like, "Ugh. This is the worst thing I've ever read."
It's so disappointing. Why can't we live a romantic life every day?
-[Tommy] Whoa. -Gimme, baby.
[Tommy] You look beautiful.
-Give it to me, I wanna do you. -[Tommy] No.
Wait, wait. Don't move.
[Pamela] Let me do you. Please?
I was just thinking about it upstairs. I was thinking, you know…
It's probably gonna get me a lot of shit for saying this,
but I really loved your dad, like, for all the right reasons
and I don't think I've ever loved anybody else.
[Tommy] What up, gorgeous?
-What? -[Pamela] Would that be awesome, or what?
[Tommy] What is the deal with that?
It's fucked. [chuckling]
Let's go for a walk.
[Tommy] Your fucking famous boobs.
I'm crazy for you.
-[Pamela] I love you. -[Tommy] I love you.
-[Pamela] That's hot. -[Tommy] Gimme a kiss?
[Pamela] Hey, I'm just gonna ramble. I'm in my bathtub.
I think what it all comes down to is that
I never got over not being able to make it work with the father of my kids.
And even though I thought I could
recreate a family, or fall in love with somebody else,
it's just not me.
So I think that's probably why I keep failing in all my relationships.
And my parents, I think, were wild and crazy,
and madly in love, and made stupid decisions,
and hurt each other and hurt us.
But they stuck it out and stayed together, and I can see that they're happy now.
So I think I'd rather be alone
than not be with the father of my kids.
It's impossible to be with anybody else.
But I don't think I could be with Tommy either.
It's almost like a punishment.
[Brandon] Here she is after another divorce,
trying to move on with her life.
Trying to have some sort of normalcy.
But then…
We have recently come into possession of a piece of material.
We hear about a TV show coming out about my parents and about the stolen tape.
New Hulu miniseries Pam and Tommy that so many people are talking about.
True story of the former couples' leaked sex tape.
You can see it all in the new limited series Pam and Tommy.
[Dylan] Why bring up something from 20 years ago that you know fucked someone up?
The worst part of her life and making a semi-comedy out of it didn't make sense.
[Pamela] It really gives me nightmares.
I didn't sleep last night at all.
I have no desire to watch it. Not gonna watch it.
Never watched the tape, I'm not gonna watch this.
Who knows how they're gonna portray it?
Nobody really knows what we were going through at that time.
They should've had to have my permission.
Are you surprised it's being told now?
I mean, it's cool, I got… Nah, I'm stoked, that's cool.
I texted Tommy the other day and said, "How do you feel about everything?"
And he goes, "Pamela, just don't let it hurt you as much as it did the first time."
[Pamela] To this day, I do not know who stole the tape.
I don't wanna figure it out.
There's no use figuring out anything about it.
The damage is done.
Why would I wanna go through that again?
I know the storm is coming.
I really don't know where I'm gonna go next, I feel restless.
[woman] How our wanting to love, our yearning for love,
our loving itself, becomes an addiction.
[Pamela] I was taking a month just to kind of regroup after my divorce here.
[woman] …severity of our problem before we can begin to recover from it.
We who love obsessively are full of fear.
Fear of being alone.
[Pamela] I called Brandon and he said,
"I thought you said you retired and wanna build houses on your property in Canada."
And I was like, "I think I need a little more than that." I'm starting to get a little restless."
I'm a little bit stir-crazy and… but I'm trying to calm down.
But maybe I'm not meant to be calmed down.
And, literally, just putting that out there into the universe,
Broadway called.
Got it!
It's the real deal. They sent me the script, so it must be real.
They really want me to do this.
Ugh. If I can only see it. Oh my God, is that cool or what?
Roxie!
I know. I'm so excited.
They said, "I want you in LA next week."
"Two weeks of rehearsal, one month of rehearsal in New York,
two months on Broadway, eight shows a week, we're doing this."
-[man] I can take this one 'cause-- -[Pamela] The others will match.
[man] Yup.
[Pamela] Oh my God.
There we go. I don't have to do the treadmill today.
This is just my shoes. [chuckling] Mostly my shoes.
Um, we're not gonna get crazy, we're doing classic.
Which one do you think is better? [laughs]
These are New York.
These are Broadway.
[Jonathan] Oh yeah, this is it!
I'm gonna have four months of just, like, I'm gonna do Broadway,
I'm gonna wear whatever the hell I want, and… and everyone can just suck it.
I'm taking both.
I'm not a natural singer, not a natural dancer.
I'm so afraid, but I like those moments that come up and I go, "Oh my gosh. Can I do this?"
When those moments happen, run with it.
Don't overthink it. I don't overthink anything.
Thinking is overrated.
[Pamela] Oh, my veil!
My wedding veil. Hmm, one of them.
[Jonathan] Which husband?
[Pamela] I don't know, I may have used it for a couple.
I recycle.
-[Pamela] They're really expensive. -[both laughing]
You know, it's okay to start something new in your fifties.
Can't believe I even said that word.
[Pamela] And the only thing that can ruin this, as we all know,
don't meet any men.
Just focus.
You know what? For once in my life, just be in love with myself.
[chuckling] Have a love affair with myself.
Wake me up when there's a veggie burger in front of me.
[Gregory] Even for musical theater performers,
it's a tight schedule. It's tight, I'm not gonna lie.
It's like jumping on the express train when you thought it was local,
and you're like, "Oh shit, I'm missing my stop."
You know, it's like that all day.
No move in this show is without intention.
And this is why Annie always looked for and hired actors first.
-Then dancers and singers. -Actors first. Right.
Look, the little gay boy in me was like, "Oh my God! Pamela Anderson, yes!" [laughing]
I probably, somewhere, in my lifetime, have tried to be Pamela Anderson.
Boom! There we go.
I wanna do one more thing, which is the Mess Around, all right?
So it's just rotating the hips around.
Oh, well.
Shit, you got that.
I've been messing around a long time.
[Pamela] I feel like it's probably the first time I'm really doing something
for no other reason than just for myself.
I could think, "It's great for the kids if I do this."
And I go, "No, I'm doing this for me, actually."
-Yes. -[sighs]
So this isn't a hot flash, this is actually work?
[Pamela] Babe.
-Hello. -[Pamela] Hi, sweetheart.
[Brandon] You know the show? I watched the first three episodes.
How'd you watch the first three episodes? Three episodes were last night?
[Brandon] Yeah, here's the thing, right? It's like, you know the guy that stole the tape?
They try to, like, give him reasons for stealing this shit
because Dad was an asshole and didn't pay him.
Did Dylan watch it?
[Brandon] Uh, I told Dylan not to.
Yeah. [sighing]
Oh God, I just…
I'm like shaking.
This feels really weird. I'm just sorry that you guys had to go through it.
That people think, "Oh, poor Pamela," or it's poor you, Dylan,
Dad, you know, Grandma and Grandpa.
Okay. Well, thanks for keeping me updated, but just…
If this… [exhales] Yeah, this is a big conversation.
-I love you, baby. -[Brandon] Yeah. I love you.
Oh God.
Ugh, yeah.
Yeah, I didn't know that.
Oh, well.
This is called an emotional eat.
I'm emotionally eating now.
This is vegan.
Oh my God. This is so good.
If there was ever a moment I could eat a croissant, it's now.
I blocked that out of my life. I had to, in order to survive, really.
It was a survival mechanism, and now that it's all coming up again, I feel sick.
From my… my whole stomach, from the middle of my chest all the way down to…
Just my stomach feels right now like it's just been punched.
I don't feel good right now.
This feels like when the tape was stolen.
Basically, you're just a thing owned by the world, like you belong to the world.
I just feel like it's just…
Just ignore them.
Let it go.
"Now I got me a world full of yes." Right? But what does that mean?
Pamela, what does that mean? World full of yes.
Finally, I got a world full… I'm gonna be respected.
I always think for me, it's like… 'cause I've been looking for that.
And again, she always comes back to the word "me."
You know, Roxie's favorite word.
I don't think so.
Her dream isn't to be famous.
Her dream is to be respected, to be seen, and to have freedom.
-So it's not just superficial. -[Rob] Right.

[Pamela] As much pain as we can endure in our lives
is kind of like the catalyst to all the great stuff, like poetry, music, art.
I'm grateful for all the experiences I had, and I don't blame anybody for anything.
I'm glad it happened.
It does feel like, uh, I've just been through a hurricane.
Feels kind of good. [giggling]
I'm sure I'm not finished.
But I have no idea what I'm gonna do next.
My kids are grown.
I'm basically alone.
And…
But I kind of like this moment right now where I have no clue what's gonna happen,
and I know I, supposedly, at this part of my life,
I should be settled in somewhere, but…
I don't know.
Maybe I'll know next week.
-[Pamela] Hi. -[man] Hi.
I figured I'd just do, like, no makeup, no whatever. Who cares?
Pretty soon I'll be naked with just a pillow in front of me. -[all laughing] -Bare, Pamela!
Pamela, bare!
Raw, bare!
What if I just do all the interviews naked?
There's no mystery here.
Oh, I figured out something.
Over-- If I wear these over my sunglasses, they work.
And I was like…
Like this, and I was like…
It totally works!
Hi, babes.
[Dylan] Good morning.
It works when you put your glasses over your sunglasses. Can you believe that?
[Dylan] You know you can get prescription sunglasses, right?
What?
You can get prescription sunglasses?
Hey… Hey, you know it's 7:30 in the morning here?
[Pamela] Get up!
The best way to get married is to tell someone, "I am never gonna marry you."
Within six months you're married, for sure.
That's what you do, okay?
You have to mean it. You have to mean it.
Like, you'll never marry that person, never.
Hi, Mom!
[Carol] Oh hi, sweetheart.
[Pamela] What, are you upside down again? Oh, no. Here we go again.
I'm upside down. Oh Mom, don't do it. Please don't do this. Don't do this.
Does every old person do this?
You bastards, why are you guys playing soccer in the alley?

Right, I found a great rooster.

Four cups? Take them.

Okay, be careful. Here. Beautiful.
Fifty cents for four cups.
What? One cup is ten cents, shouldn't four cups be 40 cents?
-Here, is this enough for 50 cents? -There you go.
-Wait, the ball. -Go away, hurry up.
-Hey Phu, one milky coffee! -Okay, I'm coming!
Hey, that's mine.
I'm coming.
-Alright, deal the cards… -Pay up, dude.
Hey, pay up. What's taking you so long?
Your cigarette.
-Your coffee. -Leave it there.
-Too small. -Too small…
Too small…
-Godammit, you're bad luck, Phu. -Hey, it's you who picked bad cards!
My cards were great until you showed up.
It was because of your unlucky hands.
-You're too noisy. Eight points. -I just got here. I'll be taking the money now.
-Taking what? -What else?
-What are you trying to take? -You guys swapped the cards, didn't you?
Kiss my ass, you want me to beat you up?
-Give me your money. -Give me your money.
Give me your pocket money.
Don't let me see you around. Watch your backs.
Sore loser.
-Give me money. -Here.

Don't blame others.
Don't blame others. Ouchie!
What are you doing? Can't you see the road?
Hey, calm down.
-What's the number? -79, God of Fortune.
-Are you sure? -Guaranteed.
Freeze.
What are you selling?
Let me check.
Please let me go. This is my first time.
I've been following this case for a long time.
No way out for you.
Goddammit.
-Why so unlucky…? -Stop.
I'll fight you tooth and nail, fatty.
-Stop. -Hey, it's Uncle Thai. Run!
Stop.
Stop.
-Help me catch him. -Hey, that money's mine.
-Ouch… God… -What?
Help me get him. The long-haired dude.
-Damn, stop! -Damn, you want to steal my money?
There is no thief here.
Hey, if you want to buy it, then buy it. If not, leave.
Don't call me a thief. I have never stolen.
Aren't you afraid of karma?
-What? -Stop running.
-Over there. -Stop.
Stop running. Where are you running to?
Hey, it's my bike.
Son of a bitch.
Asshole, I'm still paying for that bike. Give it back.
-Give back my bike. -Where are you driving to?
-Ouch! God! You dumbass. -Quick.
Crap, dumbass.
It hurts so bad. Dammit, my bike.
Hey fat-ass, let me go.
Hey, Cu Li, pass me the ball.
-Thanks, bro. -Phu.
Can't believe you're that useless.
Give me back my bike, asshole.
Where are you driving to?
Get off me. Shoo.
-Hey, I'm going to fall down… -Give me back my bike.
I'm still paying for that bike.
Give it back!
Bastards, you want to burn this place down?
My bike.
Thief!
Let me go, I won't steal from here again.
Horrible.
Mom, Dad.
Uncle Thai.
Where is your territory?
Do you have accomplices?
I can't breathe.
Let me go to the hospital first then I'll tell.
Are you kidding me? Look at him.
He's much older than you but he's fine.
You're this young and you want to go to the hospital?
He knows martial arts, I don't.
Again?
Police impersonation is illegal, you know that, right?
-But… -But you're retired.
Not settling into retirement life, yeah?
If you keep doing this,
our bosses will find out and think we're out of our depth.
I know.
But I saw that you guys were busy, so I tried to help.
I know our job is hard.
Everyone knows our job is extremely easy if everyone knows their place.
Everyone knows our job is extremely easy if everyone knows their place. Right?
-Little bit too easy, huh? -Okay, just skip that part.
This is more important: What if something happens to you?
What are we going to tell your daughter?
Oh no.
I'm here. I'm on my way. Wait for me.
-Thai. -What?
Here's your wallet.
Promise me this is the last time.
Okay.
Did you have to wait long?
I called you an hour ago, and then another hour after that, so two hours in total.
Something came up so I was late.
I can tell just by looking at you.
Next time anything happens, just call the police,
why do you have to keep on living like this?
I know.
You always say that.
How about you buy me an electric bike like Thu's, so that you don't have to drive me around anymore?
Driving a bike is too dangerous.
Let me drive you around.
Are you sure? You're always busy.
What am I busy with?
Busy caring about other people's business.
Hush, not again.
You must find it for me.
It's important to me.
You have to find it by any means.
You know me: 1 means 1, and 2 means 2.
Let's divide into 3 groups.
One goes this way, two goes in the middle.
Report, sighting of targets.
Get ready.
Hoang is not here yet.
We act when we see him.
They're cunning, I'm afraid we'll be late.
All units move.
-Freeze. -Hands up.
Hands up.
Nothing.
Hoang.
Hoang is downstairs.
-After him. -Roger.
-Get off the car. -Hands up.
What's wrong, Dad?
Nothing.
Right, to dance the Paso Doble without the limited edition 2012 Latin shoes
is like broken rice without fish sauce.
Get them for me.
Hey, what's the driver's name?
Hau, that's Hoang's bag.
We couldn't find any evidence of drugs so we couldn't convict Hoang.
He was released half a year ago.
We got someone to keep an eye on him but nothing suspicious came up
so we closed the case.
Thai, are you going to buy land over there? You keep looking that way.
I've been here many times but I've just realized
I've been here many times but I've just realized there's a real estate company there.
Right, they moved here more than a month ago.
-Bay? -What?
Do you need a delivery man?
What?
Hire me, I'll deliver far and wide, near and dear. You can just relax, huh?
I understand. Hard times, so everyone needs a job,
but my kids
just bought a house in Can Gio and keep telling me to move there.
I'm thinking of selling but I don't know when my kids are going to force my hand.
Okay, then please give me my bill.
It's okay. We're friends. It's on me this time.
I'll come back tomorrow.
-Sure, but I'll bill you tomorrow. -Okay, sure.
Your Pho is coming!
Why didn't you follow in Grandpa's footsteps and make pho? His restaurant was very famous.
Because I wanted to become a policeman.
But don't forget I was the one who taught your mom how to cook this dish.
You too, the more you do it, the better your Pho gets. Delicious!
Phu, she invited you too?
Come here.
Quickly.
Sit down.
It's the middle of the night, what's going on?
Help me bring this bonsai home. It's too heavy.
Don't you have anything else to steal?
Does your Grandpa's alter need decorations?
This tree's worth $300.
$300 divided by 3, each of us can get $115.
What kind of calculation is that?
-Did you go to school? -No.
If you didn't go to school, don't try to argue with someone who did.
Can you make it $100 for me?
-Okay. -Can't believe it.
Hurry up, bring it home.
-Hold on, let me unlock the door. -Here, let me help you.
-Can't believe you can't do it. -I really don't know…
What?
It's Thai.
Hey, hurry up.
-Caught you on the spot. -You've been arrested.
Get down here.
What are you doing? Caught you red-handed.
-No, no it's not what you think. -What?
What? So that's the reason you watched us, so you can just do it alone?
Retired policeman, huh?
What are you doing? Sneaky little bitch.
Only seven points, man. Only seven points.
Wow, what an ass. Wait…
I see…
A man of culture.
-God, control yourself. -Stop it.
You are the ones who have to control yourselves.
You're too old for this shit.
-We're going to tell My. -You think I care?
-Do you? -You all shut up.
Listen,
do you see that restaurant across the street?
Bay's restaurant.
I'm about to buy that restaurant.
Drop by if you're free.
What does that mean?
Why did he sneak into this place
when he wanted to buy that restaurant?
Let him be. If he has a restaurant, it's easier for us to do our job.
Forget about it, we're here already. Let's continue our game.
-Okay. -Yeah, let's continue.
Half and one dollar bet.
Buying what restaurant?
-What do you mean? -Oh, you didn't know?
Oh, I got it.
He doesn't want to run a business. He just wants to stalk girls.
My is here. What are you talking about?
We have to let her know the truth. Poor girl is oblivious.
He's still single.
I haven't said anything.
-I don't know anything. -Haven't said what?
Your attitude will get someone in trouble.
Buying a restaurant is not as easy as buying veggies.
It's not a one-day business. We have to think clearly.
Also, Mr. Bay… doesn't want to sell his restaurant.
-Right. -Right.
I'm still doing well. Why do I have to sell my restaurant?
-Mr. Bay. -What?
You're wrong.
-What do you mean? -Come here.
-What? -Stop what you're doing. Come sit down.
-What? -My, come here too.
Talk it out, now or never.
Mr. Bay, Mr. Thai told us about your kids.
Your kids want to pay you back,
but if you don't let them, they'll resent you.
You would force them to be bad children.
How could they face other people in society?
Their friends would ask them what happened to their dad?
What will they say?
They wouldn't dare tell anyone they couldn't take care of you.
And then what would happen next? Depression. Desperation.
Oh my God, bankruptcy, they can't work anymore.
And down the rabbit hole they go.
Wow, didn't know his business meant that much to his children's lives?
Yeah, it does mean that much.
What do your kids do?
Let me go home and ask them.
Business owners. CEOs.
You don't care about your kids at all.
If their business partners ask them what their father does,
they would say,
"He sells rice."
-"Selling rice"… -Gosh!
Gosh, how could they face other people then?
-Wouldn't that be depressing? -It's extremely depressing.
-Isn't it sad? -Extremely sad.
-Down the rabbit hole? -It's a deep, deep hole.
Oh gosh!
I never thought my kids would suffer that much.
I think they are right, Thai.
Okay, I'll sell this restaurant.
If I sold it to someone else, it would be $4,400,
but because you're my brother, it's only $3,500.
-Mr. Bay! -What?
I would like to share this…
I'm saving for My's tuition.
If I pay with those savings,
it would only be $1,300.
-Huh? -What…
Who would sell for that amount?
You see.
I'll sell. For $1,300.
You only need to give me $1,100,
you can keep $200 to redecorate the restaurant.
So you can keep the business running!
Deal.
-Mr. Bay, check, please. -Coming.
You should look for helpers now.
I'll give you the key this afternoon.
So… what just happened?
Did he sell the place for such a low price?
What if he's ill?
Hey, I still don't know who got fleeced.
You three are the worst in this area.
What now?
Do you want to have broken rice or prison food?
-Of course we want broken rice. -Deal.
Salary will be paid at the end of the month.
-You work first and get paid later. -Wait.
No salary for us.
Hey, are you stupid? You don't need money?
-No. -Of course not, just salary.
Let me explain to you guys.
Is he mad or what?
Let me enlighten you. We are all employees.
Let me enlighten you. We are all employees. -So, what will happen? -Yeah.
If we fight with our boss and he kicks us out?
-Sometimes he won't pay. Right? -Yeah…
But if we have shares, it will be different.
Each of us will get 30%.
-Great deal. -If each of us get 30%…
-Uncle Thai gets 10% right? -Exactly.
Why don't you guys go rob a bank?
You haven't done jack and you want 30% shares?
What's that about? I'll give 10% to each of you. Take it or leave it.
Wait…
another offer.
15%…
for three of us.
Deal. 15% for three of you.
Wait…
You three stay and clean up. I'll go now.
Phu… Uncle Thai… Hold on…
-Phu. -Hey, enjoy.
We'll be business owners soon.
Only 15%…
15% for three of us. What do you want?
Hey, calm down. Listen to me.
What did he say?
He said 10%, which means you had 10%, I had 10%, he had 10%…
So, I say we have 15% in total. What else do you want?
But your 15% is smaller than his 10%.
-The 10% is different from 15%. -What is the difference?
10% is bigger than 15%, Phu.
It's elementary math, and you still got it wrong.
-Did you go to school? -No.
Shut up. Did you go to school?
Dropouts shouldn't argue with the class president.
Now stop talking, and return the tree.
Business owners can't be imprisoned.
And you, stay back and clean up.
Enjoy! We'll be business owners soon.
Shit. Why didn't I go to school now that I have to listen to this dude?
-Screw you. -How dare you?
Do you want to work or not? Be careful or I'll cut your shares.
Hurry up.
Oh, wow, so beautiful.
It's only $200 but you made the restaurant look so much better.
The restaurant looks much cleaner and brighter than when I was the owner.
Here is my gift to you.
-Hey. -What?
You ass, my bike is scratched.
Your bike is a handful to drive.
-Then don't borrow it. -Uncle Thai.
They didn't have any more pork ribs. But luckily, I have other ingredients.
I got the beef ribs for the price of the pork ribs. Isn't that great?
We can't sell broken rice with beef spare ribs, you dumbass.
Are you crazy?
They only have pork spare ribs broken rice.
What is that?
Ah, I bought it to make scallion oil for the broken rice.
How could we make scallion oil from a leek?
I'll chop you like I do with a scallion.
Just make whatever with it. You are so picky.
Behave.
Relax. I'll stay and help you today.
I can taste the food and give you a review.
-Alright? -Of course. Coming in.
What is it? Why is the meat coming off?
-The cow died in vain. -You must be sad.
This is Tai-Chi beef.
We have softness in harness, and harness in softness.
Luckily my teeth are still good.
What is that?
I'm afraid you'll be shocked.
I've been shocked enough.
I have nothing to lose now.
To be honest…
I'm already dead.
And what is the name of this dish?
Dark-night-beef-spare-rib.
Cows sleep at night.
Fine, let me cover her up so she doesn't get cold.
Three dishes down, one to go.
-How would you know? -Try it.
-No. -You'll only know when you try.
Just one bite.
-Try it for Thai. -You won't die eating this.
Try it!
Gosh, he doesn't care about Uncle's Thai's face.
Just one bite.
Pho… broken rice…
I have broken rice.
-And I have Pho. -What do you like to eat?
Pho… broken rice… I want them both.
-Oh no. -Swallow it.
Why did you force-feed him?
Spit it out.
We'll be in trouble if anything happens to him. God.
So delicious.
Hey, bitch. Let me…
Can't stop eating.
Just one bite and you'll remember it forever.
Pho and Broken rice exclusive.
Uncle Thai's beef spare ribs. One of a kind.
Just one bite and it reminds you of your parents.
A dish rich with emotions.
What is it called?
We have broken rice,
grilled beef spare ribs,
-with taste of Pho. -Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs.
We got our signature dish.
I have finally got my hands on Bui Tre's Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs,
the trending dish amongst teens recently. People are flooding here to check in.
-Uncle Thai, stand up. -Hold on, wait.
Be enthusiastic, be efficient.
$270! We earned $270 today!
How can I spy on them?
Even with these clowns, the restaurant is as busy as ever.
Stop right there.
End of the line for you.
You broke my boss's teeth in jail.
Tit for tat. I'm going to pull out your jaw today.
Hey, you. Vinh, Phu…
Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs…
-How many people in your entourage today? -Entourage?
-He grabbed my butt. -What? Beat the shit out of him.
-Hey… -What happened?
What happened?
Who's making a mess?
Come on, I'll give it to you.
You're in trouble. Uncle Thai is here, y'all have to behave.
He was a policeman.
‎-What should we do now? ‎-You are lucky today.
When my Big Boss is out of jail, he'll be after you.
-Go. -Watch out for us.
Thu.
-What? -Who grabbed your butt?
Nothing happened.
You took advantage of me.
We have to help ones who are in need.
Haven't you heard that saving a life is equal to building seven temples?
Am I right, Uncle Thai?
You don't look like a bad person, what happened?
It's not what you think.
I was taking a shower, and their Big Boss got in.
I dropped the soap.
Could you help me pick it up?
I was too afraid so I pushed him out.
He slipped and then broke two teeth.
Two teeth are nothing.
If it had been me, I would have broken his whole jaw.
Okay, that's enough show-and-tell.
-Food, anybody? If not, leave. -Mind your manners.
-Food, anybody? If not, leave. -Mind your manners. Uncle!
I've just got out of jail.
Looking for a job is so hard.
-Is your restaurant…? -Sorry.
We don't accept people with a criminal record. Please leave.
What's wrong with you?
You don't know what he's been through.
Uncle, don't you feel sorry for him?
Fine, let's give him a trial period.
Yay, thank you so much.
-Come on in. I'll show you the work. -Hold on.
Let's talk first.
-Okay. -Vinh, let's go take a shower.
So…
have you been following this case for long?
Nothing gets past you.
My girlfriend worked as a massage therapist.
That guy came and harassed her.
I tried everything to get him imprisoned and to avenge her.
But life sucks.
When I got out, she was already married to another guy.
So you are not
an undercover cop?
I was in jail for fighting a cop.
Okay.
Try to stay clean.
Here, one for each of you.
What is it for?
You guys are too loud. I get headaches.
Use these.
How do you use it? Put it here?
Looks good. Put it there.
Looking good.
Does it look good?
Uncle Thai, I just met with some food-delivery apps.
They said they'll help us run some ads.
We also trademarked
Bui Tre's Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs.
-You only need to sign it. -Great. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Uncle Thai.
I'll give you my online channel.
If we go online, it'll be great for business.
Great.
-Meo, did you see what I did there? -You're great.
-Sure I am. -Focus on your work. Stop flirting.
Hold up.
-Wait. -Two bowls of soup.
Two broken rice.
-One extra rice, please. -Okay, one extra rice.
Wait.
Help me. I'm getting dizzy.
Two iced teas, please.
More ribs.
Five hundred and forty dollars…
Ah, I forgot, from tomorrow onwards, we will only take groups of four.
So, no solo dining.
What?
It's like supermarkets selling only six-pack products.
It's for pushing the sales. Understand?
Groups of four get in line, please.
You two get in quickly.
Welcome to Bui Tre's Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs.
Uncle… The next group of four get ready. We'll get a table soon.
-Thu. -Yes?
These 4 people don't know each other.
These two came first, and these two arrived later. Right?
They are friends.
These two people came first, and scheduled
with these two but they arrived late, right?
Yeah, we are friends.
Ask for each other's numbers and come together next time.
Please don't mind him.
He's writing something else.
-Thu. -More rice, please.
Yes.
Only people who are taller than 170cm can come in.
What do you mean?
What now?
Why did you raise the price?
How do we make profit with only 100 customers a day?
Why does he always create weird rules? Doesn't he care about his business?
You just ran a red light. License and registration, please.
Bui Tre's Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs, how may I help you?
-Is that Phu? -Yes.
Mr. Thai is with us. Please come and bail him out.
What?
We really don't get you.
Our restaurant was packed, and you were caught by the police.
Enough, Phu.
No discipline here, is there?
I think the one who has the least self-discipline is you.
Our restaurant was packed.
I have to take care of the clients and then I have to help the kitchen.
Had to help prepare this and that.
It's not just Phu who's busy.
I had to grill more than 10 kilograms of meat from morning till night.
I can't even talk with all the smoke in my lungs.
And you think it's easy for me?
Do you know how many dishes Meo and I have to wash a day?
More than 100 tables' worth of dishes.
I have never done anything in my life that made me worry about my hands.
Sometimes I stole with them but…
Look at the calluses on my hands. Look.
But to be honest, we're strong like bulls.
We can work as hard as you want.
But your weird rules…
are ruining us.
You have to be here…
The customers scream at us.
Why are you stalking the girl next door?
-What? Stop the bullshit! -No need to lie.
-What's that? -The girl…
Here.
You secretly took pictures of her and wiretapped her.
-You're smitten. -My needs to know this.
Okay.
His name is Tran Khanh Hoang.
I couldn't catch him last time.
It busted my knee.
That's why I bought this restaurant.
The first reason is that I wanted to gather you all here
so you won't go out and make trouble.
The second reason is to watch that place.
I didn't expect this restaurant to become so popular.
And then I could only focus on the restaurant. But I can't follow him anymore.
How can you say that?
You are taking advantage of us.
What if they suspect…
and kill us?
From the start, you gathered us here just to cover for you.
We worked really hard…
and put 100% effort to take care of your restaurant,
but you only cared for yourself.
You are too selfish, you know that?
Do you think I'm blind?
From the beginning, I knew what you guys wanted
when you tried to push me to buy this restaurant.
No one would have given you the shares like I did.
Did you lose anything?
If there had been no restaurant and I wasn't here, what would you guys be doing?
A gambler, a street vendor, and a thief?
You had nothing. I wanted to catch them.
It's good for society, what's so wrong about that?
I don't care.
So what?
That is the police's job. Not yours.
And it's also none of our business.
Why do you have to make it so hard?
Take it or leave it.
No need to keep the restaurant open anymore.
You go do your job, and I will focus on mine.
That's all.
Put your money in. Hurry.
-Two of hearts! -Pass!
Vinh, you got lucky now, join us.
-One-to-go, please. -Hold up.
-Hurry up, please. -Okay.
-No onions, please. -Got it.
More veggies.
What? Are you cheating?
Beat him up.
Please let me go.
How could I live if I got a $130-fine per pack?
-Do you know cigarettes are banned? -Yes…
You knew the law but still broke it. Sign here.
-Catch her. -Beat the hell out of her.
Please bear with me this time.
Please.
Dare to run?
Catch her.
-How far is it from here to there? -45 meters.
How long will it take?
It takes us 17 seconds to arrive at the gate.
-How do we break into it? -Three possible ways.
The first way is to use a rope and swing through.
The second way is to dig a hole.
-The third way… -Is to ring the bell.
If we ring the bell, will they let us in?
I don't think so. Can we break the lock?
Good idea. Break the lock
-What are you doing? -We are investigating.
Following your wishes.
We agreed with each other yesterday.
We decided to close the restaurant,
and focus 100% on this case.
We are working on a plan to break into their den.
No, this restaurant needs to be open.
If we close down the restaurant, our cover will be blown.
The best cover is the most natural one.
Just keep on working.
Listen to me.
Keep working at the restaurant, and keep looking for evidence.
We are humans, not animals.
We should just focus on one thing.
We can't do both. How are we supposed to live?
-I can't do it. -I will die soon.
If you can find the evidence,
I'll give you each 5% more of the shares.
Why didn't you say that at the start?
You are the one who understands us the most.
-Alright. -Deal, 5%.
Deal. Meo.
Thank you for always remembering me.
Thank you, but I won't take it. I'm not materialistic.
Oh gosh, Meo said one sentence… and made us all look bad.
You see how stupid you are?
Alright, stop discussing it.
From now on, you guys have to listen to my orders.
-Clear? -Clear.
We will follow the motto.
Catch criminals first. Business comes second.
Catch criminals first. Business comes second.
Catch criminals first. Business comes second.
Hello.
Bui Tre's Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs speaking.
Five orders. Okay, coming right up.
Grill the ribs. Hurry up.
Wait, so now does catching criminals or doing business come first?
I think money comes first.
Meo,
let me show you a clip.
Look, our clip on TikTok got 1 million views.
-Do you think I'm doing well? -Very well.
Oh, how is it going?
I don't think it's going well.
How do we know what they're doing over there if we're over here?
We only have one way.
We have to be friends with him to investigate.
Easy for you to say.
But do you know how to execute it?
Estás seguro.
Our restaurant is closed.
-So early? -Oh, hey…
We just had a lunch break, we're back now.
Please have a seat. The food will be right up.
Get the rice.
Three people?
The rice is here.
Here is yours.
-Soup, please. -The soup is up.
What now?
What's next?
Do what we do best.
Understood.
Clean up, play some cards.
We don't have too many customers at this hour of the day.
-What are you cleaning for? -Let's play some sets.
Wait…
-Deal the cards. -Let's play. Half and one dollar bet.
I don't know how to play Gin Rummy.
It's a game for four, if you don't play, who will?
-But I don't know how to play. -Just guess.
You lose a few sets and you will know how to play.
It's just a lunch break Gin Rummy takes too long to play.
Just play something simple. How about Three-Card Poker?
-Three-Card Poker? -I know how to play that.
-How much per set? -Three card poker, $5?
Seven points.
-Nine points. Thank you. -Placed.
-Deal. -Put in.
-Nine points. -Triple face cards. My win!
Thank you.
-Continue. -Let's stop.
Just a few sets in and your stomach's hurting already?
Y'all bore me? Hey watch it.
My office is next door,
you guys can just come there to play.
Wait, we can gamble in the office?
Of course.
Okay, then let us come and play there. Our boss will complain if we play here.
Sure, I'll call you guys.
Don't forget.
-Check, please. -Okay, coming right up.
Don't forget.
Our restaurant is running a Special Promotion, $9 off for our customers.
You know how to do business.
We still need some advice from a businessman like you.
Besides being a businessman,
I'm also a dance teacher.
You are also a dance teacher?
I was busy playing with you guys, I'll bring the plate back later.
No worries, I'll come over to get the plate later.
Where did you get it?
When I was cleaning up the table, I grabbed his phone.
-Unlock it. -Why…
-It's so hard to hack into a Blackberry. -What now?
Sir, you forgot your phone.
-Meo's a smart cookie. -Of course, he was in jail.
He is not only handsome but he is smart too.
What does jail have to do with being smart?
Have you ever been in jail?
-Not yet. -Shame on you.
-Three first. -Seven.
The three beat the seven. You're wicked.
King.
Don't think I'll go easy on you just because you're my bro.
-Three-of-a-kind. -You're doomed.
Hold on. Four-of-a-kind.
I can skip the round here, right.
-Here it is. Here. -Thank you.
Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs, super good.
-Meo, where is Meo? -So stinky.
Hey, why are you throwing shrimp paste at their door?
Long. Go easy.
-Yes. -Where is Meo?
There are so many people there.
-Stay away, kids. -Leave it to him.
His nickname is Mad Dog Long.
No one knows what his next move is.
Long will take you by surprise.
Film it.
Film it so anyone who wants to make a scene at your restaurant would have to think again.
Long can handle this.
He can beat up 25 to 26 guys at once.
He has a legendary elbow move.
His arms might be out of order,
but his legs have been waiting to kick for more than 10 years.
They are no match.
His leg is broken.
It's time for me to shine.
Hey, kids…
Why don't we relieve our problems by dancing?
911… Call…
-You stay put! -Mr. Thai… Please call…
Please call 911.
Call an ambulance!
Remember us, baldy.
No need to call, just delete the clip.
As you wish.
We are here at the renowned Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs restaurant.
And this is the one who mainly works on the dish.
So, hi there.
Can you tell the audience the secret behind such great spare ribs?
To make good spare ribs, 10% is based on the ingredients,
the remaining 90% depends on these tongs.
These tongs help us grab the meat, and we have to do it quick so that the meat is cooked evenly.
and we have to do it quick so that the meat is cooked evenly.
Stop bullshitting.
I'm freaking tired and you're bragging?
It's recording. Cut this part out.
Welcome to Bui Tre's Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs.
Please sit.
Rice.
What would you like to eat?
-Shit. -Yeah?
-There's a cockroach on the plate. -Oh gosh.
Maybe it has just dropped down from up there.
I just brought it out.
-Change to a new plate, now. -What kind of service is this?
Why are there so many cockroaches in here?
Wait… you…
You are grabbing my arm so hard it hurts!
-You want to set us up, don't you? -Ouch.
-Help, please. Help. -Hey.
Help me grill.
Everyone…
Look… The fish sauce is too sour.
-What do you want? -Look, the knife is rusty.
Calm down.
-Are you okay? -I'm bleeding.
Want to make a scene here?
Be careful. Watch for me a bit, can you?
Son of a bitch.
-Lift him up. -Let's go.
Slowly.
-I'm not going to make it. -Shut up.
You are in the wrong place.
Remember my face.
This restaurant's going down.
-Is he okay? -He didn't watch the road.
Are you okay?
Sit down, please.
Get out there.
How was that?
I paid the compensation so he withdrew.
What? These assholes came and made a scene at our restaurant,
and now we have to compensate them?
-Go look for him. -Go.
Stop it, Thu.
-If we can let it go, let it go. -Let it go?
I can let it go when they mess with me, but they tried to ruin our restaurant.
Right.
Don't you care about our restaurant's image?
You want to keep the restaurant's image?
-Take off the apron and go fight him. -Please, I beg you guys.
Meo, come here and help me.
You guys should calm down.
Wait until nighttime when no one is paying attention, we'll go find them and beat the hell out of them.
-Great, Meo. -Good idea, Meo.
Stop it. I say stop it.
Do you still remember our restaurant's motto?
Catching criminals comes first. Business comes second.
Hello, this is Long.
I'm here.
We'll have a party tonight. Come over and join us.
Okay.
That place has three floors.
If we want to investigate, it will take time.
We need to have a plan.
One, two, three. Cheers.
Vinh and Phu organize the game to distract them.
Meo, by all means, has to find ways to leave the place early,
followed by me and Thu.
When the signal is on, Meo immediately turns off the electricity.
After the electricity goes off, Phu and Vinh must keep them in the same place,
and Meo immediately returns to back us up.
Thu stays on the 3rd floor, and I stay on the 2nd floor.
In five minutes, we have to find evidence of their crimes.
Uncle.
Uncle.
It's a hypothesis and you're laughing already.
What was he thinking about, holding that bunch of onions?
-What if he suspects us? -Exactly.
We have to have a signal to withdraw safely.
So cute.
Are you mad?
Focus, guys.
Listen.
Our plan has to be executed precisely and correctly.
-Are you all clear? -Clear.
Let's do it.
Cheers.
Enjoy yourselves.
Cheers.
Hey, why don't we play a few rounds?
Sit down, we are drinking.
We'll play later.
Cheers.
Have grilled beef. It's great.
Thank you, everyone.
I know you never forgot me.
What are you guys doing?
I'm stuffed so I took off my belt.
I knew you were too full to stand so I got you a chair.
I drank till the last drop…
Any beer left?
Pass the cake over, I can help slice it.
I didn't even blow out the candles.
Let me know when you need me.
You're fucked.
Let's see what you have to say.
You can do it, Meo.
Happy birthday.
It took me so long to pick this for you.
Why did you give me this?
You are smart, figure it out.
I bet he didn't know.
Wow, what a great present! You know me so well.
Here, let me blow out the candles.
Cheers.
-Two, three, cheers. -Wait.
Wait.
-Where is Hoang? -Yeah.
-Hoang? -That's right. Where is he?
-Hoang. -Lift him up.
-What's wrong? -Lift him up.
-Is he okay? -Who smacked his neck?
-I… did… -Put the beer down.
When you set off the fireworks, I suddenly fainted.
Get the coin.
No need…
It's not lucky doing that at a birthday party.
You guys have fun.
-Put this back, please. -Cheers.
-Let's continue. -Cheers.
One, two, three. Cheers.
-Cheers. -Rock, paper, scissors.
‎Cheers.
Cheers, Vinh.
‎Cheers.
Thai.
Going to pee. The restroom downstairs is occupied.
-So I had to come up here. -I see.
It took you a little too long.
Long time, no drinks?
Thai.
Weren't you a policeman before?
It was a very long time ago.
I got old and retired early.
You might not recognize me,
but I recognize you.
You danced at Gia Dinh park.
Looking at your moves, I'm certain that you are a dancer like me.
Exactly.
How come you're selling broken rice now?
I got hit by a cab and busted my knee.
Lucky you, though.
Quit one job and could start another one right away.
You're luckier.
Let me tell you my story.
I was lost in my ways too.
Luckily, I was in the same jail as those white-collar criminals.
When I got out of jail, I got some money and invested it all in real estate.
I was preparing to enjoy the get-rich-quick scheme but the pandemic hit.
I'm in deep shit now.
It's life, it has its ups and downs.
If you are patient, God has a plan for you.
That is what I like about you.
I like the way you talk.
I have some business…
I'd like to discuss with you.
I want to make your restaurant a chain.
-A chain? -Right.
Just give me a number. Don't think too much.
I think we shouldn't…
You're right, we shouldn't talk about business while drinking.
I like you.
Let's go down and continue drinking. Let's go.
Hello.
I'm up here with Mr. Thai.
Go buy more food.
It seems that Thai wants to invest in real estate.
He's looking at our company's profile really carefully.
Oh, shoot.
Hoang.
This is just a misunderstanding.
Misunderstanding?
You were a cop, and I was a criminal.
You should be careful. But this is…
Freeze.
Calm down.
Freeze.
Hold.
You really are a professional.
You look so cool holding a gun.
Estás seguro.
These lighters…
-I was just kidding with you. -Hot, it's still hot.
If you like it, I'll give it to you.
These kids gave it to me.
Go down and keep drinking.
Don't just stay here and keep laughing like this.
What?
What "gun" are you groping for?
You can't have my biological "gun."
If you can't drink, don't do it.
Tried to drink too much and now you can't hold it.
You are the one who forced…
I think Hoang is right.
Hoang again.
Did Hoang bewitch you?
I'm on your side.
You want to focus on talking or puking?
-I can't stand seeing you like this. -Uncle.
You still suspect Hoang?
I have been following him for the last few days. I think Hoang is focusing only on his business now,
and even creates jobs for these people.
It's just that you don't want to give up, right?
Even if you don't catch criminals, you still have the restaurant.
-You can make a living this way. -Uncle Thai!
-Shoot, you scared me. -What?
The restaurant owner apologized to his client by breaking his client's neck.
As you can see, this is surely not the end.
If you want to know what drama comes next, please like, share and subscribe.
-Well, that's all folks. -Here, let me.
What are we going to do now?
I think I need to consider Hoang's franchise offer.
You bought this restaurant for $1,100.
It has a reputation now, I can only sell it for double the price.
Here you are.
-Here. -Thanks.
Homemade herbal drink.
We accept your offer, but the franchise fee is…
Tell me straight.
We have…
-Many customers. -I know.
The fee will be around…
How about this?
I'll make an offer that we will both be happy with.
$4,400 for each restaurant.
I will pay $44,000 as a franchise fee for 10 restaurants.
$44,000?
If you agree, we will draft the contract.
Kim will transfer $44,000 to your account.
Deal?
Estás seguro.
Uncle, we don't know how to thank you.
Thank you, Uncle Thai.
Uncle.
I've never had this much money in my account. Thank you.
-No worries. -Please drink.
You deserve it.
You guys have money now,
you don't need to stay here with me anymore, but remember,
you always have to earn an honest penny.
We will remember.
Uncle, can I say something?
Can I please stay with you? I don't want to leave.
Okay.
Just one sentence and he turns us into the bad guys.
It's like you're saying that we took advantage of Uncle Thai.
Yeah, like we're burning a book after reading it.
Like we let a new one in, and kick the old one out. Hey, chicks stay together.
Wow, unbelievable.
Talking in idioms like rich people.
We're high class now.
Alright. Meo will stay here and help me.
Phu, you will start your own business, won't you?
Yeah.
-What are you going to do, Thu and Vinh? -We will do what we're best at.
Hello, everyone. Look at the red one. Only $17 and only one left.
Here it is, pastel. Very pretty. It's $13
Please leave your phone number.
Next, please. Okay, you two, please come in.
The next four people, please.
Wait, it's 20% off for the grand opening, right?
Right. Grand Opening. 20% off.
Hello, boss.
-Thanks. -Good luck to you.
-Okay, enough. -Thank you.
Ship this for me.
This pair of shoes is $240.
-We'll take two. -Okay.
Over there, Dad.
-Coming right up. -Rice with ribs and eggs please.
You can sit outside.
Hey, the rib is burnt.
Take it or fuck off.
What kind of service is this?
We're only selling 100 portions today,
and only for people who are taller than 170cm. Are you taller than 170cm?
Four people, let them in.
Fuck off, I'll beat the shit out of you.
What do you want?
Meo, come here.
Look.
Take it or fuck off.
Hey, you can't say that. We pay for the food.
I don't know, Uncle.
Oh God.
Why are they closing so early?
The restaurant is not doing well recently.
Hoang said he wants to close the restaurant for a few days to train his staff again.
Okay.
Drive safely.
Where are you driving?
-Do you know how to use your brain? -I like doing it this way.
Shit.
Hey, girl. Hello, food delivery.
Hey.
Hey, girl.
I don't know.
-Stop. -I don't know.
I'm telling you to stay still. Freeze.
Give it to me.
Help! Please help.
Are you abusing her? We have a pervert here.
You are misunderstanding.
-Call the police. -No.
Everyone. Beat him.
Here.
Why haven't you come home yet?
Today is My's birthday,
it's also…
I know.
Have you finished work?
Want to go grab some drinks?
Thai.
You have to go home.
A special occasion…
is only special,
when you have your family beside you…
Sit down and eat.
Hey, I'm watching that.
Let me explain.
I thought that girl was suspicious, so I wanted to check up on her.
Have some food.
Is it that bad?
It's delicious.
Let me tell you what happened in my class.
They said you were a pervert,
but I didn't believe it,
so they showed me this clip.
I was wrong,
really.
Don't do this anymore.
I can't stand it.
You say you can't stand it?
Do you think I can stand it?
You spend your whole day trying to catch criminals.
It has been the same for 17 years.
You care about other people's business,
but you don't care about this family.
You bought a cake?
Throw it away.
You know, before Mom had a stroke,
she said she wanted to wait for you, so we could celebrate my birthday together.
But ever since,
my birthday is just a day to remember her.
Have you ever thought of my happiness?
Why did you buy a cake? Do you think I can eat it?
I tried to persuade myself that you and I are both suffering.
But no, you haven't changed at all.
I have to admit that you are selfish.
I won't be like Mom.
I won't stay here and wait for you.
My!
My!
In just one night,
I lost your mom,
my career,
everything.
Don't you see that I'm also hurt?
But there are some things
I can never let go of.
Then for how long
will you live like this?
You take everything for yourself.
They don't need you
as much as you think.
Take care of everything you want,
and then come back here to take care of this family in Mom's place.
What is this mess?
My employees went to the new territory, and were attacked by people in that neighborhood.
Every house has its own master. It's normal, man.
What happened?
I invested in cryptocurrency.
They said I could earn up to 10%.
I invested all my money, and the platform crashed this morning.
I lost everything.
Shit, money disappeared
even faster than when I was gambling.
-You lost it all? -Yeah, not a single penny left.
Please drop me here, sir.
Got you.
What happened?
I imported some stuff,
but customs said there were no legal documents.
They took them all.
Alright,
I still have some carts here.
No need to put much money in.
We share the profit evenly, and start again. Okay?
Okay?
-Brothers… -Brothers.
Phu.
You are too good to be true.
If I hadn't listened to you guys trying to be white-collar,
if I had stayed with Meo in the restaurant,
I would have had not only money, but also love.
You were
the first one to mention that to us.
You were the first with the move.
Yes, it was me. But you two followed.
Now I'm hungry, but I feel embarrassed to go over to the restaurant.
Just go over and look for Thai. He will make you something to eat for sure.
I can't see Uncle Thai, not after this failure.
No, he is the one who can't see us.
What?
This clip has been viral since this afternoon.
In the end, I'm also a loser.
I can't even manage my personal life,
not to mention social matters.
Maybe it's because other restaurants didn't do it right.
I think My was just too mad.
You know she loves you so much.
Thanks, kids.
In troubled times like these,
only you guys listen to me.
Uncle, can you be less cheesy right now?
I get goosebumps easily.
Uncle.
We can't leave you now.
Can we
go back to the restaurant?
Okay, let me tell Meo to redecorate and we can start again.
Thank you.
Can I go inside and grill the beef?
-Have some drinks too. -Okay.
Let's do this.
-Come in. -But I don't have a key.
Meo keeps the key.
But I can't call him.
-Or did the guy find a new girl already? -Shut up.
Bullshit. Let me call him.
What happened?
Singles like you won't understand this.
Hey… why is he going there?
See.
Maybe he went there to discuss the other restaurant chains with Hoang.
Meo has never… contacted them directly.
I think… there is something wrong here.
-Speak. -Go on in.
You hid in jail for a while.
Now you're out, you tried to get all the stuff for yourself?
Spit it out for me.
You don't know?
Speak.
Speak.
Speak.
If the police had come, you and I would have been in deep shit.
For the last time,
where did you hide it?
His teeth look awful.
Let me help him fix them.
Where is it?
The harbor.
The harbor.
I'll tell you. It's in the harbor.
You should have said earlier.
Run!
Run!
-Thu. -Phu, keep her.
Uncle Thai.
Jump.
Phu, it hurts.
Are you okay?
Where are you running to?
Uncle Thai.
Well…
So crowded!
Surprise!
Meo is my man.
You just ran the red light. Your driver's license, please.
You have no way out.
I'll call the police on whoever dares to vandalize my restaurant.
Smart guys make smart choices.
Sooner or later this would have been revealed.
You guys can't get away from this.
Uncle Thai…
Thanks to you, our job went smoothly.
Thank you, Thai the Crippled.
It's always been the same.
You are too hasty.
How is your leg nowadays?
Uncle Thai…
Uncle Thai!
Uncle Thai!
Why are you doing this, Meo?
Uncle Thai!
‎Stop!
Today is a good day
for doing business.
Let's go to the harbor.
-Uncle Thai. -You stay put.
Come here.
Make it quick for old times' sake.
Okay.
Stand up.
Who beat me the most the other day?
-Me. -Me.
Brave!
-I'll shoot you first, shit-face. -Shoot me.
Let them go.
No, one for all and all for one.
Vinh.
Vinh…
I didn't shoot yet.
I didn't shoot yet.
I'm shooting now.
-Vinh! -Vinh!
Prop bullets!
My eyes are still good.
Smart people make smart choices.
Have you been following this case for long?
Thu, turn on Meo's GPS.
Hey, where are you looking?
Sir. Meo reported that they are on the hook.
-Get everyone ready. -Yes, sir.
Good stuff, sir.
I let this fatty go for a swim.
Sir.
Uncle Thai didn't know Meo's duty.
I'm afraid…
It is dangerous.
I hope they won't be too hard on the criminals.
What does that mean?
-Cop? -Run!
Police here.
You are surrounded. Don't move.
-Shit. -I said you can't escape.
You too.
If you want me to go easy on you, then cooperate with us.
Asshole. Being two-faced?
Go.
You don't know yet.
The Triple that are following Thai are all monsters.
Because Vinh's family was too poor, he couldn't follow his dream career.
He is a Vovinam prodigy.
He won the City Championship twice.
Thu used to be a gymnast.
She joined the SEA Games.
If she hadn't been injured,
she could have won two or three gold medals already.
It's extremely hard to catch Thu.
Phu was on the National Soccer Team,
but he was barred forever, because he got caught match-fixing.
Sad waste of a young talent.
And Thai is the monster of monsters.
His achievements can be made into a 1,000-episode series.
And do you know what his super power is?
What is that?
"Immortality."
Run, sir.
It hurts.
Bitch.
-Thu, watch out for the knife. -I got it.
Thu.
You could've let me know earlier, Meo.
You can get to him only over my dead body.
-Wow, such a cutie. -Watch out for the knife…
Alrighty.
On her foot.
She has such long legs.
Hey, girl.
Pick on someone your own size.
Watch out for the knife on her foot.
Okay.
There's on in her hand too.
-Okay. Help. -Let me.
Vinh, it hurts.
My muscles are torn.
Don't pass out. It hurts.
You bitches dare to fight me.
I'll kill you all.
Vinh. "Grill" her ribs!
-"Charge" her hard, Phu! -Go to hell.
Tablecloth special move!
Run. I can keep him back.
Let's go.
Go.
She has too many knives. -Scumbags. -I can't handle her.
I'm killing you all today.
-What is the plan? -Where is Meo?
Dare to mess with our restaurant?
You're in big trouble.
Hoang, you are under arrest.
For drug possession and smuggling.
You are no longer a cop.
Stay true to yourself.
Do you want to catch me because I'm a criminal or do you only want revenge?
-Both. -So we are no different.
I'm different now.
I was wrong
and now I want to fix it.
I see you are preaching now.
Preaching?
Stand up.
Stand up and start preaching again.
Stand up.
Can't stand anymore?
Estás seguro.
You think you can get away with it?
Stay there.
I will look for you.
I'm coming for you.
Where is Thai?
Sir.
Is the ambulance coming?
We meet again.
It's time for you to deliver the food to the River God.
You're so clingy.
One leg crippled and the other broken,
and you can still make it?
Still smiling?
It is just a lighter.
I know, that's why I took it.
To light some incense for your grave?
For your grave.
My!
-Dad, stay with me. -My!
I did it.
I saw it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I won't be selfish anymore.
Today is my birthday,
you haven't heard my wish, right?
I wish that you will always be healthy,
and be by my side
on my graduation day, on my wedding day.
Promise me.
I promise.
I promise.
-Hurry up. -Please stay out here.
My Dear Daughter,
I'm sorry…
that I have always been absent in your special moments.
Sorry that I may be
absent on other occasions too.
But I'm sure that
should you have any problems,
Phu, Vinh, Meo
and Thu
will be by your side and help you with all their hearts.
Just like I used to help them.
My!
Hey, turn it off.
You've been listening to it again and again.
I like it. I didn't think you were that cheesy.
Are you sad that you couldn't make it to the Tribute Ceremony today?
Not at all, accompanying my daughter is the most important thing.
What did you bring me here for?
I will let you know. What is my wish?
What is it?
This is it.
I want to cooperate with you to open a Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs restaurant.
Okay.
I'm happy to cooperate with you.
-Uncle. -Hello.
We are in trouble.
-If you don't help us, we'll all die. -Emergency.
Why are you guys crying at your Tribute Ceremony?
The money that we got from Hoang was illegal money,
do we have to give it back?
Right, you have to give it back.
-But we spent it all. -We don't have a penny left.
It's okay. You can still make money.
How are we in more debt after helping catch the criminals?
-Okay, I'm hanging up now. -Uncle.
Uncle!
Hello, everyone.
Meo.
My wife.
Hello, everyone.
-Hello. -Hello.
What would Meo like to have?
What does Meo's wife want to eat?
Thu can make it.
You have egg on your face.
Look at that.
What's wrong with you?
-It's okay. Just go in. -Let her be.
She's always like that. We're used to it.
When one door closes,
another one will open.
Don't worry.
Phu is here.
I will spend the rest of my life taking care of you.
When one door closes, another one will open.
-Vinh is here. -Screw you.
I will spend the rest of my life taking care of you.
Don't worry.
It hurts, Phu.
I don't care about you guys anymore.
It hurts. You forgot I can do martial arts?
-Thu. -Screw you.
Don't bother me anymore.
What's keeping them? The train will leave any minute now.
-I'll go and look for them. -I'll join you, we do everything together.
-Noor. -What?
Jules, Grandpa. Where were you? The train is leaving soon.
Bad start, Noël. And the holiday hasn't even started yet.
-We're going skiing, we're going skiing. -Hey, how old are you, really?
-I'm ten years old. -More like five.
Jules, Noor, stay here. Where did Jet go?
At platform 1, the 11:34 Dingie Ski-Express to Inssbruck will depart…
That's our train. Jules, Noor, we're leaving, let's go.
-Alright. -Come one. Watch out.
So guys, finally we're all going on holiday together.
Very nice.
Really so nice. Just amazing.
Jet?
Do you have it?
Beautiful.
-Is it a good idea? -Of course, it's an amazing idea.
Isn't it too soon? For the kids?
The kids also think it's amazing, you told me yourself.
And this skiing holiday is the perfect opportunity.
That's why we're going on this holiday.
The only thing we need to do now, is to find the perfect moment to propose.
And I've brought everything I might need.
I just fell in the snow, head first. Only thing you could see, were my ski's.
-Do you think that's funny? -Yes.
Okay Felix, focus. This is your schedule for today.
If you ever want to be a champion skier, you'll have to train really hard.
We'll start with…
You don't have time for that. I told you to focus.
Your training is all that's important. Winning is the only thing that matters.
You want that, right? Just like your dad.
Yeah…
We start in the morning with 20 minutes runs, and after that…
-Are you going skiing? -Me? On those little slats?
Never in my life.
I am. I'm going to be the best skier ever. I don't think so.
You bet I will.
-Yeah? -Yes.
Okay.
-First put on your PJ's. -No, I'm not going to sleep.
If you want to become the best skier ever, you need to be well-rested.
-Go on. -Alright then.
-But I'm taking the top bunk. -No way.
Yes, I am.
Five years old, really.
Jules, Jules. Later, in my cabin?
-Okay, once Noor is asleep. -Make sure no one sees you.
Okay.
Noor?
-Hey, Grandpa. -Hey, Jules.
-Is Noor asleep? -Like a baby.
-Time for the presents. -Jules, wait. Sit down.
Son, if we use our magic snow globe to go to the North Pole right now
to get the Christmas present for the kids and bring them round
and then want to go back, we won't come back here.
We'll come back to my home, at my shop in Belgium.
While your mother, Noortje and the others are in a hotel in…
-In Austria. -Yes.
We need to wait for now.
We need to wait until we have a room in the hotel and then we can…
-Reset the home button of the snow globe. -Exactly.
In the meantime, we should come up with a plan to stay away from the hotel
without anyone noticing.
What was that?
-What's all this stuff you brought along? -Just some nice scarfs.
-Nice scarfs? -Yes. You never know.
It's definitely going to snow,
but it could also be suddenly become really hot.
You never know.
-There you go. -Thank you.
So, did I tell you the truth, or not?
Ella.
-Hello. -Hi.
-What do you think? -I'd wouldn't mind working here as well.
Maybe in about ten years or so.
-Shall I show you the rooms? -Yes.
-Guys, are you coming? -This way.
Yes, I'm the first one.
Very nice.
There you go.
Jef and Suzanne's room.
Jet's room. I'll see you later as well.
-Are you okay? -Yes, yes.
-Can you get into every room? -That's the advantage of my job.
-There, Noor and Jules' room. -Wow.
-We're sharing a room. -Yes.
-And here's Noël's room. -I'll give you a hand.
No, that's not necessary. You go and explore our room.
-So you can pick the best bed, little one. -I'm not little.
Of course not.
Alone at last. I'll reset the snow globe.
Wait a minute.
What's this?
What?
I definitely heard something.
I don't hear anything.
I think you should get your ears checked, Grandpa.
-Ouch, you're sitting on my hair. -I can't see a thing.
-You're on my hair. -I'm sorry.
A little bit of light would…
Holger…
-Her idea. -Yeah.
But the gifts station is in good hands, Mr. Claus.
-Yes? In which hands? -Well, Ikka.
And Joel.
Joel?
-A teddy bear for Fleur. -What? A teddy bear?
No way, that's old news. Girls don't want teddy bears, they want dolls.
She'll just get a doll.
I WOULD LIKE A LEGO FIRE STATION
A fire station for Alejandra? Who makes this stuff up?
I'll tell you exactly what girls want.
Girls want a unicorn with long lashes, extensions and…
purple lip gloss. Girls go crazy over purple lip gloss.
And why couldn't a girl play with a fire station?
And why couldn't a girl play with a fire station? Girls can like that too. What you're saying is ridiculous.
Girls can like that too. What you're saying is ridiculous. Mr. Tough Guy.
-Don't fire us. -Mr. Claus would never do that. Right?
Right, Mr. Claus?
This is perfect for our honeymoon.
Is this our bed?
Are the springs broken?
-Ella. -Hi.
I forgot my cuddly toy in Grandpa's room.
Could I get the key to go get it?
-I can't do that, I'm sorry. -But I miss him so much.
-And Grandpa wouldn't mind. -I'll go with you.
-And Grandpa wouldn't mind. -I'll go with you. You don't have to, you're already so busy.
You don't want to get fired, right?
Quickly, then.
Bath beads.
And rose-scented foam. And bath bombs.
What's wrong with a simple bar of soap?
-Do you think it's the maid? -Oh, sweetheart…
Or a thief.
Holgie, it could be a murderer.
And I haven't tried the jacuzzi and breakfast in bed and a massage yet.
Will it hurt?
Is that the snow globe?
-Just breathe, sweetheart. -Breathe…
-Grandpa? -Noor?
Who are you?
I sometimes ask myself the same question.
And what is this?
Is Grandpa Santa Claus?
After me, of course.
What?
Cool. So you are little Christmas elves?
So we're on the North Pole with all the presents, right?
-Correct. -Correct.
And correct again.
Does your grandpa know you're here?
I wouldn't…
No, wait.
Noor, don't.
-Mr. Claus won't like this. -No.
-Joel, do something. -Who, me?
-Look at how big she is. -Can't you…
Gunna, Holger?
Grandpa forgot his wallet and we need to rent skies, so…
Jules?
-It's a disaster. -What's a disaster?
-Noor is in the cabin. -What?
-Exactly that. -Yeah.
Jules? What are you doing here?
I should ask you the same thing.
How did you get this? You're not supposed to know.
-Why not? You know too. -That's different.
-Why? It's not fair. -I'm Santa Claus, okay?
You? Santa Claus? But what about Grandpa?
-Grandpa too. We do it together. -Can I be Santa Claus as well?
No, of course not.
-Why not? -You're way too little.
-Little? I'm ten. -More like five.
-That's not true. -No, little one?
"We're going skiing, we're going skiing."
I don't think so.
If you want to conquer those mountains, you need a good breakfast, little one.
-I'm not little. -Noor, it was just a joke.
Not a morning person, just like someone else I know.
-Look who's talking. -Me?
Almost just as beautiful as the North Pole.
Jules? Is something wrong?
Nothing I can't handle.
Wanna race?
-Yeah. -Wait.
I won. Silly, right?
So? Delivered all the presents?
So you didn't think to tell me
that your sister discovered the secret Christmas world?
Jules?
-I just wanted to take care of it. -That's exactly what I mean.
I'm still here, I could help you.
I thought you'd say that she could join us.
And I don't want that. I'm Santa Claus.
Waiter, can I get some more spiced wine?
Thank you.
Listen, Christmas is the most important thing.
Dad thought so too. And you said it yourself.
I just want to make him proud.
Your dad was Santa Claus. The bonified Santa Claus.
But he was also your dad and Noor's dad and your mother's pride and joy.
For him, you, your mother and your sister were the most important in the world.
And he wouldn't want you to exclude your sister.
It already happened.
So you'll have to work together. And remember, it's not a competition.
What if she tells everyone? Then the Christmas world will be in danger.
Your sister is more capable than you think.
Okay.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Do you call this skiing? On this hill for babies?
Be careful not to fall, baby.
Whoops, is your family not here to hold your hand?
I can do it alone.
So I'll have to go to the North Pole without you tonight?
The North Pole?
-Do you want to play a game? -I'm going to bed. Skiing is tiring.
Sleep tight.
Okay. Jules, Grandpa?
I'd like to, but I think I'll hit the hay a bit earlier tonight.
Noor is right. I'm going to bed too. Sleep tight.
Good night.
I'd like to play a game.
Come here.
-Did the kids go to bed? -Yes.
Yes, this is the perfect moment for your wedding proposal.
-Have you been drinking, Jet? -No, I haven't.
But they have a jacuzzi here and I've got the perfect bath oil.
Nice and soft, nice smell, very romantic. All you need.
I don't know. I was thinking more like a candlelight dinner.
A candlelight dinner? No, this is way more exiting.
A jacuzzi.
Yeah…
-Did your mom kiss you good night? -Yes.
-Alright. That gives us a few hours. -Us too.
-Jet. -Mom?
Jet.
Bath oil. Bath foam.
I used the wrong bottle.
How could that happen?
Noortje, are you sure you want to do this?
Yes.
I'm really experiencing déjà vu.
Because there's no way back after this.
-Yes? Okay. -Yes.
-Yes? Okay. -Yes. Then I have one golden rule.
You can't tell this secret…
Because this is a secret.
You can never ever tell anyone.
Otherwise Christmas could be in danger.
-Yes? -Yes.
And don't touch anything.
Exactly.
Now there's only one thing left.
There.
Congratulations.
We'll go to the North Pole first to get the presents
and then we'll go to Mexico.
Mexico.
You shouldn't do that to your vocal cords, really. Oh, sweetheart…
-Mexico. Jules, here. -Thanks.
Look…
A Christmas tree. And another one, look.
Oh, cookies.
-Don't touch anything. -Okay.
Except when it's for Santa Claus.
Okay.
I heard something downstairs.
Sorry…
Enrico.
My goodness.
Okay…
Hide.
Who's there?
Good evening.
Good evening. I'm Santa Claus.
Santa.
-You're Santa? -Yes. I'm Santa.
Are you listening, Enrico?
The police, come.
-Police. Come on. -Carmelita, I'll call the police.
No police, no.
Oh no, not the police.
Oh sweetie, yes. A bit more to the left.
Exciting right, a honeymoon?
Just as exciting as typing out toy lists.
Did you say something, Holgie?
Noor, I told you not to touch anything.
-Now it is exciting. -Get out, I don't want to see you anymore.
What happened? Where's Mr. Claus?
Sweetheart, put those cotton pads back on your eyes. I'll do your other foot.
Jules, do you know anything about Grandpa yet?
After your ski lesson, you'll come back here with Jef to have lunch, okay?
Jules, you too.
-I'm going to have lunch with Grandpa. -Me too.
Okay. So where is Grandpa? I haven't seen him all morning.
He's on his way. He wanted to sleep in.
-And is Jet not coming? -No, she has a headache.
Good morning, Hotel Schnee Halm.
Yes.
Jules, Grandpa Noël for you.
-Grandpa? From his room? -Room service?
-Grandpa, where are you? -In some prison in Mexico.
I don't know where exactly. But Jules, listen.
This is the only call I am allowed to make.
Don't worry about me, I'll be okay.
But you need to take care of Christmas.
The presents and everything.
And do it with your sister, Jules.
-Okay? -Yes.
Are we going outside? It's so hot here.
-Finally. -Yes, come.
Give me your cell phone number.
-Dude, seriously? -Yes, zero, four,
-five, seven… -Eight.
Enough. Your call is now over.
Thank you.
Grandpa?
Grandpa, where are you?
Alright, Noor. Ready for the next step? It's actually very simple.
Stick your bum out and just sit down.
But I'm very scared of heights.
What's wrong? Are you afraid of the ski lift, baby?
Calm down, boy. You should help her instead of making fun of her.
As far as I know, people who help others don't win.
And Felix is a winner.
Come on, Felix.
I'm gonna see where Jules is.
I'm never drinking spiced wine again.
Here you go.
I thought this vacation would be different.
What do you mean?
I don't know. I thought we'd be together more.
I haven't seen Jules this morning and I've barely seen Noor.
And they only want to have lunch with Grandpa today.
Little children grow up. Just let them.
They'll come find you when they need you.
You do know what that means, right?
You have enough time to focus on Jef and to propose to him.
Yeah, like yesterday, right?
Just think of yesterday as a rehearsal.
But this time it's for real and I know exactly what we'll do.
"We?"
-Jules? -What?
-Do you know where Grandpa is yet? -No.
-I'll help you look for him. -I'll do it by myself.
I have no time to babysit you.
Was that really necessary?
Mr. Claus would want you to work together, really.
Grandpa isn't here right now, is he?
Okay, guys. Let's look up prisons in Mexico.
I need to find Grandpa.
Just a nice, hot sauna.
Where are you going?
We don't all have to look at that screen together, right?
-And Mr. Claus said he was fine, right? -Yes.
And apparently the spa is amazing here.
I also want to go to the spa.
Are you crying again? You really are a baby.
Stop calling me that. It's not true, I'm not a baby.
Okay, prove it.
On the top of that mountain is an old cabin. I'll race you.
Okay.
But how? You're afraid of the ski lift.
You'll see.
Do you happen to know the coordinates for the mountain?
-Why do you need to know? -Homework.
We're learning about it at school
and need to write down the coordinates of our holiday destination.
I do have some maps here.
Hold on.
Yes.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
Are you sure you wouldn't rather have stayed in the valley?
It's all for the good cause.
There. I think that's the perfect spot, there.
Just look at that snow and the fog.
So romantic. Just like in a Christmas movie.
Jef is coming.
-What if he says no? -He won't.
-How can you know for sure? -I'm a good judge of character.
Look, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
That's true. And I've brought something
which would melt the heart of a lot of people.
Just open that.
-Chocolates? -Yes, but not just any chocolates.
This is a box full of love.
Okay, I'll go before Jef gets here.
-No, I have to pee first. -Here?
Yeah, it's so fun to pee outdoors.
Jet?
-How will I ever find Grandpa like this? -There goes our honeymoon.
Excuse me?
It's awful. For Grandpa.
-And our honeymoon. -Yes.
Yes, there. You need to scroll down.
He doesn't need to scroll down. Let him do it.
And later we'll just…
-We're taking a break. -We're going to the spa.
To the spa.
Who put bath foam in the jacuzzi?
-Every day? -Yes.
We're doing this every day.
And we'll keep practicing until we can't anymore.
Yes, I've beaten them here.
Just because my dad can do it, doesn't mean I can.
You just need to try it once, you'll be fine.
Jet?
Come on.
-Hey, buddy. -I don't want to anymore.
I want to go home, to my parents and my brother.
Felix, I know it's lonely at the top, but tomorrow's qualification is important.
-You need to win to become champion. -I don't need to do anything.
You do and you know it.
Let's go. Down the hill three times, in less than ten minutes.
I just want to go home.
What? How did you get here?
This could help you.
A snow globe? How can that help me?
Are you making fun of me?
Are you too afraid to try it or something? Baby.
Why are you doing this?
Why not?
Okay, good. Do you happen to know your home's coordinates?
Come.
Here, sit down.
I think a candlelight lunch inside is much better.
-Now? -Yes, the kids are with Grandpa.
-A candlelight lunch? Can I join you? -Definitely.
-Nice, with the three of us. -The three of us?
No, candlelight meals are always with only two people.
Just the two of us.
-Where are you going? -To have lunch.
Like that? You're not going like that, are you?
You, go to you room and freshen up a bit.
And you come with me.
You need to make a little efoort for a candlelight lunch.
Turn around and let me see.
What was that?
Animals, over there.
Animals?
Oh… Sorry sweetie, but…
This is not what you think. It's just…
There were little people over there.
Little people?
I didn't expect this from you.
But Jet, I really am innocent.
-Jules? -Grandpa?
Jules, I managed to get a phone,
but I still haven't spoken to a lawyer.
Mr. Claus in jail?
I think it might be time for you to come and get me with the snow globe.
Do you have more details for me?
Details? Yes, well…
I can hear water.
And I can also hear seagulls.
-I can see light. -Seagulls and light? We need more.
Flashing light. I can't really explain it.
Such a bummer that Mr. Claus doesn't know what the flashing light is.
Okay, it's near a light, but we first need to know what light that is.
-Hey, shouldn't you be skiing? -Hold on.
Grandpa, does the light flash horizontally or vertically?
Okay, do you know something that lights up like this?
A flashlight? A siren…
-A lighthouse? -Yes, that's it.
-Thank you. -What are you doing?
Something for school.
You as well?
Come get me, quickly.
I have to go, Jules.
It worked.
-What did he say? -That Felix wants to quit his training.
Can you imagine that? I never quit. Training, training, training.
That's all I did. No fun trips, no friends, nothing.
And what does he do? He just complains all the time.
Honey, don't be so hard on him. He's still young.
I was also young. And if he doesn't win, he's no longer my son.
-I want to go back. -No…
Felix, wait.
Noor, did you do what I think you did?
I just wanted to help.
I found the solution.
Holgie, tell him.
-Jules… -That light flash is a lighthouse.
How many prisons will be near a lighthouse?
Just tell him.
There, just one.
-Jules… -Where is the snow globe?
Right…
-Where's the snow globe? -Very good question.
You need to give it back, it's not mine.
I'm going to use it to win the qualifications.
-If I use it to get down, I'm way quicker. -That's cheating.
Don't care, at least I'll have qualified.
What if they see you? The snow globe is a secret and it'll get me into trouble.
-I'll make sure they won't see me. -I thought we were friends.
I don't need friends.
What is going on here?
You again? Don't you have any manners?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself, Felix? Is this discipline?
We'll go and get your stuff. Three times up and down the mountain.
And you stay here.
-Noor exposed the Christmas world? -I told you not to exclude her.
Yeah, that was definitely said.
I was right not to trust her.
There's one golden rule. Never talk about the Christmas world and she did.
Yes, but…
-Jules. -Grandpa.
Jules, hurry up.
-Grandpa? -Calm.
Grandpa?
Are you still there? Grandpa?
Come, come on then.
Grandpa, are you okay?
Come on,
Grandpa?
I need to find the snow globe.
And Noor.
Yeah, well…
-Noor? -Is this your sister?
-Yes. -Keep your eye on her from now on.
-Where's the snow globe? -With Felix.
And where's Felix?
Noor, what did you do? Christmas is the most important thing.
-You've betrayed that. -Oh no, Jules. No.
And Grandpa. Because of you we can't get him back.
He may even be dead already.
Noor.
Noor, what are you going to do?
I'm saving Grandpa.
You shouldn't do it by yourself. Wait.
-Are we almost there? -No idea.
And? Noor?
Does he have it? What are we going to do?
-I have an idea. -Okay.
Help, help.
Let me out of here. Help.
He's in the closet.
-Shouldn't you do this with Jules? -No.
It's my fault Grandpa is in trouble.
So I need to fix it myself.
-This is not the prison. -I'm afraid of heights.
Oh, no.
The snow globe.
No. Noor, stay there and hold tight.
Don't move. Stay put, Noor.
No, hold on tight. Don't do it.
Oh, no. Stay calm. Okay.
Grab my hand.
Grab it.
I need the snow globe.
-For Grandpa. -I know.
Okay. Hold on, Noor. Okay.
Okay. Remain calm.
Come on, you can do it.
-Grandpa? -Jules, I'm okay.
Grandpa.
Gunna, Grandpa is still alive. -Noor.
-What did she do now? -Together…
Lighthouse… Oh no, we can't.
-Gunna, calm down. -Afraid of heights.
-Grab my hand, but it's too small. -Gunna.
Gunna, calm down. Tell me what happened.
Noor wanted to get Grandpa with the snow globe,
but we landed on the lighthouse and then she fell.
-Help. -Noor, give me your hand.
Come on.
Jules, I'm sorry.
No, I'm the one that should say sorry.
I shouldn't have excluded you.
From now on, you can be Santa too.
-But together, not by myself. -Together, with Grandpa and with me.
I'm sorry.
-Shall we go and get him? -Yes.
Nice, right?
We deserved this.
How do you think Mr. Claus is doing?
He's a big boy, he'll be fine.
I'm sure he's less hot than us. Right now.
Completely insane. Santa Claus.
Santa Claus?
Hello? Santa?
Is Grandpa in that cell? Yes.
-But we have to stay undetected, okay? -Okay.
How will we ever get Grandpa out of here?
I have a plan,
but we first need to go to the North Pole quickly.
-Do you have the snow globe? -Yes.
Okay, great.
Okay, let's go. Go ahead.
Ready?
-Ready. -Okay.
Go.
Silence. Shut up.
-Grandpa. -Jules.
-Noor. -Where's the key?
-In the top drawer. -Go, get it.
I knew it. I knew you would come and get me.
-Come here. -Grandpa.
-I knew it. -Guards.
Shake it.
Santa?
We're going on a honeymoon, she said. Nice and relaxing, she said.
No problem whatsoever, she said.
-What's keeping them? -And what do you call that?
Well, I call that a fluffy hurricane.
Well, I call that a fluffy hurricane. Yes, fireworks with flower petals. Sugar on strawberries…
Mr. Claus, they saved you. Finally.
We were incredibly worried.
And you've retrieved the snowglobe. Just in time to deliver the presents.
Felix. Felix is still up there.
Not by yourself.
Wait for me.
-Felix, are you alright? -You.
You locked me in here.
-Felix. -Don't.
-Don't do it. -Don't.
-Don't do it, boy. -Felix.
Wait.
Help.
-Help. -Felix.
Help.
-Felix, give me your hand. -The snow globe, I can almost reach it.
-Felix, don't. -I need it to make the qualification.
-Otherwise I'll never win. -Not important, we need to work together.
You're way more important than that stupid qualification.
Give me your hand.
I can't hold on.
I told you we would do everything together from now on.
-Grandpa. -Noor.
Thank God.
Noël, come.
Come here.
Jezus, Noël, the storm. Where were you?
-We were hiding in a cabin. -They have a jacket just like Santa.
Noël, you'll never do this to me again. From now on, the kids have lunch with me.
They're back. Yes, luckily. Goodbye.
-Come. -Just a second, mommy.
I'm sorry, Grandpa. I should've never let Felix see the snow globe.
Now it's gone and you can never go back to the North Pole.
And no one will get presents anymore.
Jules was right, I would be the worst Santa ever.
Why did you show Felix the snow globe?
He wanted to see his parents and he was all alone.
I just wanted to help him.
Someone who always teased you?
And that's exactly why you're the best Santa ever.
Go to your mother now, she missed you.
Jef said he's really sorry.
For whatever he did.
Maybe I overreacted a bit.
You think so?
What's wrong?
I don't know.
I can't get the marriage proposal together.
And it seems like you two don't want to be here with us.
Maybe it's too soon and we should just leave it as it is.
No, no. Noor and I just had a little fight.
-Really? -Yes.
It's already been resolved. Who can stay angry at such a little one?
I'm not little.
Five years old, really.
Why don't you propose to Jef tonight, at dinner?
When everyone's there.
Is that what you want?
Yes.
Dad would also like it if we were a family again.
-I can't find the ring. -What?
-How can that be? -No idea, I had it in the train.
Okay, no problem. You can do without. -No, but…
It'll be fine. Just ask him.
What's that?
Yeah, otherwise it would never happen.
Yes.
Really?
Of course. Wait.
No.
No, I mean, yes. Yes.
-Your food will get cold. -Yeah.
Hey, Noor.
Are you going up the mountain by yourself tomorrow?
And then smooth skiing to the bottom?
I don't know if I can do that.
You know what I think? I think you can do more than you think.
-Sleep tight. -You too.
Okay Felix, watch out for that turn.
And you see that one? You need to…
Hey, focus.
-Come on, Noor. -No, wait.
Come on, you can do it.
Jef is right, you can do it.
Are you insane? It's almost your turn to qualify.
Sometimes it's not about winning, but about working together with your friends.
Together?
Together.
Felix.
Alright, Felix.
Now you're a real winner.
Sorry, Grandpa. I messed up.
That's weird.
-Noor said the exact same thing. -What?
No, that's not true. I excluded her.
That's why she went to Felix.
All because I wanted to do it by myself.
Now what? Without a snow globe we can't deliver packages.
Yes… No…
But…
How?
-We need to leave right away. -We?
Aren't you forgetting someone?
-Noor. -I have to go to my brother.
And… thank you.
And don't tell Felix this time.
[Oprah] How you feeling? [Viola] I'm nervous.
[Oprah] Don't be nervous. I just saw your little picture and I wanted to start boohooing.
So here we are on my porch in Maui.
[sighing] Maui. Thank you for being here in our happy place.
-Oh, thank you for having me. -Thank you for joining me. I know we've known each other for a number of years.
We've had other interviews, but I have to tell you when I read this book…
something happened inside me. I… I thought, "Wow!"
What a wonder.
What, um… what… what an incredible life
that you have manifested for yourself,
that you have used the strength,
that you have used the power that I don't even know where you got it.
When I finished the, not even the first chapter,
when I finished the first paragraph, 'cause you know how you open a book…
Yeah. [laughing] …with the first words.
I was calling everybody I know to say
we must choose this as a book club
to have as many people in the world read it as possible.
What was it about this time
that you were ready to expose this level of truth about yourself?
That is my most frightening question. Could I say that, Oprah?
I believed that I was having a bad existential crisis.
That's what I believe.
Um, I wrote the… really wrote the book during the pandemic.
But existential crisis, meaning that crisis of meaning.
-What's my meaning? -Uh-huh.
How do I connect to the world feeling very disconnected, very isolated.
And was it the pandemic that had made you feel that way?
-I think the pandemic, um, exacerbated it. -[Oprah] Exacerbated it. Yeah.
I think before that time,
what's happened with me over the last probably 12, 13 years
is the ascension to a level of fame.
-I think it's safe to say. -[Oprah] Mm-hmm.
[Viola] And the feeling that once I hit it and once I got on top,
that somehow my life was going to open up.
All of a sudden,
it would be some sort of feeling
where, uh… that I have arrived,
that I know the meaning of my life,
and the heavens were gonna open up,
and God was gonna sing,
and that's it.
[Oprah] Shrewd.
-Where's my Coke? -"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" boys.
Where's my Coke? I need a Coke. Hot as it is. Shoot.
[Oprah] Vulnerable.
-Throw the priest out then. -[woman] I am trying to do just that.
Then what do you want from me?
[Oprah] Fierce.
I gave 18 years of my life to stand in the same spot as you!
[Oprah] These are just a few of the portraits in Viola Davis' collection
of astonishing portrayals.
They don't care nothin' about me.
All they want is my voice.
[Oprah] One win and four nominations
makes Viola the most celebrated black actress in Oscar history.
I became an artist, and thank God I did,
because we are the only profession
that celebrates what it means to live a life.
[Oprah] Her Emmy-winning turn as Annalise Keating
in Shonda Rhimes' How to Get Away with Murder…
That's what it costs to change the world.
[Oprah] …is a role Viola describes as powerful, liberating, and life-changing.
So who wants in?
[Oprah] Viola's first love, the theater, has awarded her two Tonys,
both for plays by the legendary playwright August Wilson.
I was born into a certain circumstance where I couldn't see it with my eyes,
I couldn't touch it with my hands, and so I had to believe it in my heart.
And I would live the rest of my life in joy and peace…
…and, um, sort of like, uh, Cinderella…
[chuckling] …when Prince Charming comes in, and that didn't happen.
What happened was excitement at first
and then the feeling of exhaustion,
the feeling of really, um… um, impostors in my life
in terms of friendships, people overstepping their boundaries,
people feeling like I was a commodity.
Um, pressure.
The pressure of unseen responsibility.
All I know is it wasn't it.
Then the question is, "So, Viola, what is it?"
[Viola] What is it?
What's home to you?
And how do you get at it? And I didn't know the answer to that.
The only thing I could think to do was to go back to the beginning of my story
was to go back to the beginning of my story
because I think that once you tell your story over and over again,
you start to hear it, and you start to think, "Okay. How did I get here?"
And what it does,
what it emphasizes is you go back to the purest form of Viola.
[Oprah] Wow, I know--
And you find out, she helps you define
what it is that you would call home.
You go back to this.
-[Viola] Yeah. -You go back to this.
Yeah.
I mean, that's how I knew in the first paragraph,
this is a book that everyone should read.
Well, I knew, like anything,
that when you start a book is it's sort of like a salutation.
-[Oprah] Yes. Yes. -And you say, "Hi. How are you?"
-You know? So… -[Oprah chuckling]
-So you did. -[Viola] I did. I had to introduce me.
And me is always that little girl, eight years-old, third grade,
who would wait at the back door during dismissal.
who would wait at the back door during dismissal. And as soon as that bell rang,
I just ran over people.
I was pretty tough.
I ran over everyone so I can run home
because I knew the same eight to nine boys were going to be chasing me,
calling me Black, ugly nigger, and they would pick up anything they could find on the side of the road,
and they would pick up anything they could find on the side of the road, bricks, sticks, anything.
And the vitriol that would be thrown at me.
Um, and the level of hatred
when they were saying those words of Black, ugly nigger.
And, um… and I would run, run, run, run, run.
-And I would chuck the finger. [chuckling] -[Oprah] Mm-hmm.
I would say all the cuss words
and, um…
But that really is the memory that defined me.
Because what I always say is that I thought I was really, really slick.
I was tough, brought a crocheting needle to school.
Threatened them at one point, got them to stop running after me,
but I always say
that I never stopped running. My feet just stopped moving.
Wow. But as I went through my life,
as much as I tried to put on that mask of bravery,
of confidence,
of being that sort of boss woman that people talk about,
of you don't let anyone see you, uh, sweat.
You know, if you wanna climb the ladder, you gotta believe in yourself, girl.
So I put all the language and the mask of that on,
but inside, absolutely, was the damaged little girl
that I left in Central Falls
who really, really believed that she was ugly.
That she was
not enough.
That's what defined me more than anything else.
-I wish it were a different story. I do. -[Oprah] Mm-hmm.
But it was so powerful,
and you know with girls--
Do you wish it now was a different story, or are you like…
Maya used to say, "I wouldn't take nothing from my journey now." Are you now at a stage where,
Are you now at a stage where, because of that little girl
and because of the terrorization that you experienced on all levels,
and because of the terrorization that you experienced on all levels, that you recognized that's why you are who you are?
Yes. I do. I do recognize it.
Yeah. That without that, there wouldn't be this.
Absolutely.
I… I do recognize it.
I do believe that your life is sort of a dying of self.
I do. In… in the same way that a phoenix rises out of the ashes, right?
And I do believe that it's a part of your journey and finding yourself
And I do believe that it's a part of your journey and finding yourself is going to these caves of trauma and vitriol
is going to these caves of trauma and vitriol and all of those things.
And somehow in the midst of that, it's like Joseph Campbell says,
as you go down this path of transformation
of really trying to become your ideal self…
Right. …you're gonna meet the part of yourself that you don't wanna be.
You're gonna see all of your flaws.
You're gonna see all the things that cause you pain. [Oprah] Mm-hmm.
You're not gonna see God,
you're gonna see you.
And then you hope that… [chuckling]
…I think that I have it in the first paragraph,
that, you know, when you meet that self that you no longer wanna be,
you have two choices at that point.
You can just stay there
and be swallowed, or you can move on.
I choose to move on. I didn't want to be swallowed,
and I made that decision at 28, 29 when I went into therapy
that I wanted to be different.
Tell me about your parents, Dan and May Alice.
-Not Mary Alice. Not Mary. -Dan and May Alice. Not Mary Alice.
I love, love, love, love my parents.
-[Oprah] My daddy and mama, you call 'em? -[Viola] Yeah, my mama and daddy. I loved.
[Oprah] During her childhood, Viola describes her father, Dan Davis,
as strict and violent, but also the first man who loved me.
Viola writes that her father, because of his circumstances,
had a 5th-grade education
and ran away from an abusive home at age 15.
He worked most of his life as a horse groomer.
Viola calls her mother, May Alice, loyal,
a self-sacrificer, and a maternal warrior.
May Alice was raised on a plantation in South Carolina
and gave birth to Viola there.
Her mother worked in factories and as a maid,
and fought for welfare reform in the 1970s.
Viola's parents were challenged by racism, poverty, addiction, and abuse,
but stayed married for 48 years until Dan Davis's death at age 70.
They raised Viola and her five siblings together in Central Falls, Rhode Island.
But it was just a life of abject poverty.
It was a life of deprivation.
That… that's what it was. A life of deprivation.
-[Oprah] Yeah. -No food…
I thought I grew up poor, Viola, until I read your story.
-[Viola laughing] Yeah. Po'. -So I will now say, "Hello."
-Po'. -"I bow to po'." Okay?
-[laughing] -I grew up poor. I was not po'.
You… you were-- And you know what how people say… many people say, "I grew up poor and I didn't know it"?
You all knew it. Yep. Absolutely.
-I say we knew we were po'. -[Oprah] Yeah.
[Viola] You know, the plaster coming off the walls,
and, um, always being hungry.
-This is not fun-- -[Oprah] In cold Rhode Island.
[Viola] Freezing, plumbing never working.
You know, you had to fill the bucket of water to put in the toilet to flush it.
Never having a phone. Never having a phone.
And, um, wetting the bed. -I was a serious bed-wetter. -[Oprah] Hmm.
Most of the furniture… We… we got some furniture on the side of the road.
Most of the furniture from Salvation Army.
-Um… -You were a bed-wetter until you were 14. [Viola] Fourteen.
An apartment, one of our first apartments,
infested with rats. An infestation.
I mean, at night you had to put your hands over your ears,
so you couldn't hear them eating the pigeons on the roof at night.
And… and listening to them eat your toys at night
and jump on top of you in the bed.
This is the line that got me. I'm gonna stop with the jump…
I wanna interrupt the "jump on top of me in bed," 'cause just the thought of that…
But this is what got me.
And I… I remember so vividly thinking, I've read a lot of novels,
a lot of… a lot of memoirs, a lot of history.
I mean, not even Pecola Breedlove in The Bluest Eye.
Pecola Breedlove is pretty hard.
[Oprah] Pretty hard, but not even Pecola Breedlove had--
"There were several fires and the building soon became infested with rats."
"In fact, the rats were so bad, they ate the faces off my dolls."
"I never, ever went into the kitchen."
"Rats had taken over the cabinets and the counter."
"The plaster was constantly falling off the wall,
revealing the wooden boards holding the house together."
I remember growing up in a flat, you know, on welfare with my mother
too afraid to go into the kitchen at night
'cause they would come out from behind the refrigerator and the cabinets.
-[Viola] Yes. -Yes.
Absolutely. And then my sister, uh, Diane, um… [chuckling]
She was reading stories of rats eating babies in Harlem in the cribs.
So then… then she told it to us,
and then we felt like we had to wrap, um, coats or shirts around our necks at night
to keep the rats from biting our necks.
And, um… and we would listen to them--
And they would jump on the bed.
They would jump on the bed and eating the… [scoffing]
'Cause I had a doll that had… what, um… was made of hard plastic.
-So like porcelain. -[Oprah] Yeah. I had one doll like that.
-And to hear the eating of that doll. -[Oprah sucking teeth] -[Viola] I mean loud. The crunching. -[shuddering]
And then when I woke up, the entire face was gone.
-Ugh. -Yeah. [Oprah] There was a shocking point in the book,
where you were talking about the violence in your home.
And there was a seminal moment
when your father was beating on your mother,
and you tried to stand between them.
And he had taken a glass and had cut her in the face.
-[Viola] Yeah. -Describe that moment.
Put us in the story.
Yes. It was a particularly violent fight when my father said,
Yes. It was a particularly violent fight when my father said, "I'm gonna… I'm gonna bust your head open May Alice."
And I had my baby sister in my hand,
and, um, I was so terrified.
It just got really heated, and he finally… he smashed her head with the… with the glass.
-[Oprah] Oh. -And the blood came spurting out.
And by that point, my fear, um…
And by that point, my fear, um… my fear had… had taken over,
and I just remember screaming, "Stop it!"
"Just stop!" "Give me the glass!"
And I can't tell you, it's sort of like, um…
I don't know, coming face-to-face with a giant.
Coming face-to-face with your fear.
This is my father.
And, first of all, you never told Dan Davis what to do.
-[Oprah] Right. -'Cause…
-Also-- -…I was terrified.
We grew up in the… in the era where you don't talk back to your parents anyway.
-At all. -At all.
So here I was doing the unnatural thing,
which is telling a parent to stop doing something
that he should not have been doing.
And I can't tell you that… how much it cost me something
to step outside and this--
Everybody,
especially at 14…
[sighing] …you need a parent. [Oprah] Yes. Yes.
You need a guide. That person with, sort of, that lamp.
-Right. -[Viola] That proverbial lamp. That's gonna take you down darkened paths,
and gonna teach you something about navigating life,
even though, you know, you're still gonna face some crap in life. Yeah.
But someone to show you how to do what they did.
Yeah. You're not supposed to be showing them.
-No. Not at all. -[Oprah] Yes. Yeah.
And for me, it cost me something
to tell a parent to don't do that.
You're gonna kill my mom.
I… I wasn't… I did not have the emotional maturity,
an… an… an engine to be able to do that.
But I found myself doing it anyway.
But the surprise of that now, and I think I wrote it in the book, is that I had it in me.
and I think I wrote it in the book, is that I had it in me. [Oprah] Yeah.
I had a different sorta strength in me that maybe I couldn't see at the time…
-That's what you wrote. -…but was ever-present.
And that moment actually caused a shift in you
to realize that you did have it in you. [Viola] Yeah. I think, uh, it did.
-Like after that, a lot of things changed. -[Oprah] Yeah.
[Viola] Fourteen was the age I decided I was gonna be an actress.
Fourteen was the age that I won a major art contest,
and I thought I was Slick Willie for doing that.
Fourteen was the age that I realized I really wanted out,
and I saw a way out.
A hole had been been blasted through this cave that I was in.
[Oprah] Yeah. I wanna just say to everyone that you eventually forgave your father,
and became very close with him towards the end of his life.
And that you understood as an adult that he was dealing with his own demons
and had come from, you know, such hardship and such tragedy and such--
Literally, you know, not being seen
and… and victimized himself.
Well, they say that that's what successful therapy is.
That when the day comes when you realize
that your parents did the best they could with what they had.
And In the end you realized that he loved you. How did you know, Viola?
Because he told me and he showed me
every single day.
Even when he would be in the car with me driving,
and I drove into a parking lot,
he would say, "Boy, that's so good, daughter."
"You such a great driver. I love you so much."
He would go to… He went to all of our plays even if they were in New York.
-Was it hard, though, to forgive? -Yeah.
Because I remember when I was… Gayle and I were talking about your book,
and she was saying, "I just don't understand how you can forgive
when a parent has done so much damage."
Was it hard for you to forgive? -Absolutely it was. -[Oprah] Mm.
It is, and it still is, I would say. But it's a choice.
You actually use a line in here that I often use for describing,
you know, forgiveness.
That it's giving up hope that the past could've been different. -[Viola] Yeah. -And you use that line in here.
-[Viola] Yeah. -And you use that line in here.
So you had reached that point and recognize that I can't change what it was.
and recognize that I can't change what it was.
-[Viola] Absolutely. -And so I'm just going to march forward.
Yeah. I mean, listen,
uh, y-you know…
At the end of the day, that's what we're all trying to do.
We're all trying to do the best we can with what we've been given.
-And that's it. -[Oprah] Mm-hmm.
We just don't have a face of what that looks like.
I think that sometimes we watch too much TV. [Oprah] Mm-hmm.
And we… we want lives to be played out the same way.
A 41-minute drama is played out on Thursday night lineup--
-And it don't work that way. -[Viola] And it doesn't work that way.
That everything is… becomes a, sort of, extension to how much you're willing to accept the life that God gave you…
to how much you're willing to accept the life that God gave you…
and how much bravery you have to forge ahead
and create the life that you actually want.
Want. Yes, ma'am.
And it becomes, you know, it's like…
My therapist told me that life is about two things.
Living life for pleasure, and gratefulness, and joy,
but also the understanding that the downtime is gonna come.
-Ugh. Yes. -And if you can, sort of…
be somewhere in the middle of that and understanding that,
then you could, sort of… It's survivable.
For me, when I was younger, I thought I was cursed.
I was like, "Okay, um, you know, no one thinks I'm cute."
"So I don't have that."
"I'm poor. I don't have any money, any resources." [chuckling]
You know, I have a lot of violence in the family.
I was like, "Where's my sunlight?"
"Where is it?"
Until once again, this is the power. I say it to people all the time.
You find people in your life who love you.
And what those people do, because they love you,
and they love all of you, even your flaws,
is they give you permission to be able to love yourself.
What do I mean by that?
Ron Stetson who said, "Don't you know, you're beautiful, Viola?"
"I've always seen you as beautiful." "You do?"
-Okay. I wanna go to that moment. -Yep.
The first time you show up at Upward Bound,
this is an organization that's helping kids from the inner city.
I love this moment where Ron is talking about,
uh, what it means to be an actor.
And every… "Who wants to be an actor?" He asks the question.
And everybody raises their hand.
And as he continues to talk about how difficult it is to be an actor…
How many rejections you're gonna have, how hard you're gonna have to work,
how many times you get turned down.
the hands start going down, and the hands start going down, and the hands start going down,
and yours is the last hand remaining.
And you say that my dreams were bigger than my fears.
[Viola] Absolutely.
I needed a dream
like I needed food and water.
That dream wasn't just a goal.
That dream was my way out,
was my, sort of, salvation.
You know, I just wanna interrupt here to say, uh… You know, I grew up poor.
Having read your story, I… I don't even understand,
uh, poverty like the kind you have experienced.
And what I came away from, the book,
believing is that the shame of it,
the shame of it is actually the worst.
And there is a story that you tell here
about a time where the electricity was off,
there was no gas, the pipes were frozen,
you all had all wet the bed.
Everybody is at home, you can't… There's nowhere you can go.
And your sister, Diane, decided she was gonna go to school.
And she got up and she spit her face and wiped her face and said,
-"I'm going. How do I look?" -Mm-hmm.
And then your mother decided you all were gonna leave to go find heat.
Can you describe that moment?
I just picture all of you walking down the street in your, you know, shoes and the holes in your shoes.
you know, shoes and the holes in your shoes.
-It's Rhode Island. It's snowing and cold. -Freezing. Mm-hmm.
And the teacher, Mrs. Prosser, comes out and sees you on the road…
And says, "Mrs. Davis, Mrs. Davis, why aren't your kids in school?"
"They haven't been in school all week."
And my mom says, "We don't have no heat."
"Um, the pipes are frozen, so the water don't even come out."
"And we all really cold, and we don't have no food." And… and then she, Mrs. Prosser,
And… and then she, Mrs. Prosser, who, once again,
who, once again,
you know, one of those people that gives you permission.
Yeah.
[Viola] Okay. Um…
She had tears in her eyes,
and she was touching our faces, and she said, "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Davis."
"I'm so, so sorry." "You let us know whatever we can do, you know, for you."
"You let us know whatever we can do, you know, for you."
"I'm so sorry."
But, you know,
Mrs. Prosser is interesting.
Mrs. Prosser would call me to her office from time to time
with a bag full of the most beautiful clothes
that were hand-me-downs from her daughter.
And she would give it to me because she knew I needed clothes,
which by the way, I was like… it was like giving me just some jewels
When you are in the face of compassion
and empathy…
…it's amazing how it kills shame.
Because you're seen.
And you're seen for something way more valuable than your circumstances.
[Oprah] Yeah.
That's why I bring her up. She saw you. -She actually saw you. -Yeah.
I remember when, I think it was a teacher or a nurse
who had come to… who had been assigned to speak to you about hygiene
because you were wetting the bed all the time.
So you'd come to school smelling like urine,
and she gave you this lecture about how to go home and clean up yourself,
and you did.
I think that at the end of the day, what I was looking for is love.
Yeah.
That sort of radical… power of love.
[Oprah] You have so many beautiful moments like that in here.
I… Do you know why I love that moment so much? Because I-- Teachers were my saviors.
-Absolutely, my saviors. -[Oprah] Teachers were my saviors.
[Viola] Like I said, there's power in love. It's radical.
But I can't describe, even in words,
that it was a hard, uh, story to tell
because at the same time, my sister Deloris was also called to the office.
We were both called because we smelled really bad that day.
Could you smell yourself? Did you know you smelled?
-Yeah. -[Oprah] You did?
-I didn't know what to do about it. -Yeah.
You know, I think that people just automatically assume,
well, you just clean yourself.
-[Oprah] Mm-hmm. -Well, not if anyone doesn't show you.
Once again, going back to the Stevie Wonder song.
"Show me how to do what you do. Show me how to do it."
-No one showed me. -[Oprah] Mm-hmm.
And we didn't have any hot water. A lot of times we didn't have any soap.
A lot of times we didn't even have any clean clothes.
You know, we'd wash the clothes by hand the night before,
hang them up to dry, and try not to hang them outside.
Because we'd hang them outside sometimes, but it's cold.
-So, the next day, they're icicles. -They'd freeze. Yes.
So you hang them out to dry, and the next day, if they're not dry, they're wet.
But then if you're not clean, you're putting on wet clothes…
It's all the… People don't realize that if no one shows you,
People don't realize that if no one shows you,
then you have to figure it out on your own.
And I didn't have the tools to figure it… figure it out on my own.
And then I was ashamed that I didn't have the tools to figure it out on my own.
So then all I had, all I could do was swim in the shame.
Yes. I love… There's a line that you use.
I think it's on page 89 where you talk about…
You're… People are always saying, "Just do better. Do better."
"Try harder. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps."
But hard to pull yourself up when you don't have a boot.
Absolutely.
Absolutely. You know it's… it's… it's the vision of what you want in your life.
You know it's… it's… it's the vision of what you want in your life.
Right? The… Or the discovery of what you wanna do.
It's a vision of where you wanna end up,
but there's this whole part in between of how to get there.
That whole journey of someone who gives you that rope,
that… that… that sword,
that, you know,
that knife, whatever.
That whole in between is what you have to figure out.
And that was the thing that became rickety.
That I wanted someone to help me figure it out.
[Oprah] Yeah.
And In the midst of all this, there's also sexual abuse going on in the home.
There's nothing that didn't happen. -You had sexual abuse. -[Viola] Yeah.
Violence going on in the home.
You have the tyranny of colorism, sexism, racism.
I was so struck by the fact that your mother's story
I was so struck by the fact that your mother's story that she only went to the 8th grade because she was beaten in school
that she only went to the 8th grade because she was beaten in school
by the light-skinned teacher for not being light enough.
And that the same thing happened to your sister Diane
when she was in South Carolina.
Beaten by the teachers for not being light enough.
Beaten by Black teachers in a segregated school
for not being light enough.
Absolutely.
You know, I think that…
…failure and hardship is an interesting learning tool.
Because I think that once you hit bottom,
then you either stay there or you figure out how to rise up. [Oprah] Mm-hmm.
And I think that that's what happened with all of us.
Even my sister Diane back in the day,
and my mom, that you either survive or you don't.
[Oprah] The sisters, you all were your own little army. [Viola] Mm-hmm.
[Oprah] Where would you be without your sisters?
-[Viola] Yeah. [laughing] -You said you all were your own platoon.
-Yes. Absolutely. -[Oprah] Yeah. Yeah.
[Oprah] And on page 75, you write this about your sisters.
You say, "Some battles we won,
survived together and emerged with laughter and perspective,
and some brutal ones, sexual abuse, we lost."
"Sexual abuse back in the day didn't even have a name."
No, it didn't.
It's just, you know, that dirty old man on the street,
you know, who wanted to give you a quarter, but then wanted a kiss.
you know, who wanted to give you a quarter, but then wanted a kiss. [Oprah] Mm-hmm.
No one knows what boundaries are with little girls,
especially back in the day.
So, if a… a guy said, you know, "Give me a kiss."
Someone said, "Oh, give him a kiss. It's not a big deal."
Or someone leaves you with a male babysitter
because that male babysitter is a friend of the family.
And then your parents go out and they leave you alone.
They don't think anything of it.
You know, we didn't have social media back in the day
where people would talk about statistics of how many girls are molested--
That's right. Wasn't even… wasn't even… wasn't even a word for it.
But I think what you've done in this book
is revealed a part of yourself that is really a part of us all.
Yeah. [Oprah] Every person who's struggling for self-love,
and I just so appreciate you being honest enough to be able to say
that when you were first on stage,
and you would get the adulation and the applause,
and the people saying, "I'm so moved by what you've done and what you acted,"
that you…
At first, you are satiated by that, for a moment,
but then you come to recognize that that really has nothing to do with self-love,
and actually begins to create this feeling of being an impostor.
Absolutely.
You feel, first of all, you feel an impostor in your work. [chuckling]
I didn't wanna feel the impostor in my life.
I would think this book is my gift to others.
[Oprah] Yes.
I felt like it was, uh… it was a sort of…
It was a gift to yourself.
It was a releasing for yourself, but… and in that releasing,
all the other people are gonna be so served by this story.
-I hope so. -[Oprah] Yeah.
It's my way of owning my story.
It's my way of not, sort of, sweeping it under the rug
and creating this other image of me
because I feel like in creating this different image,
it's proving to those boys that I actually was all those things…
[Oprah] That they tried to call you.
-[Viola] Absolutely. -That they called you.
Or tried to make you believe.
And that you believed for such a long time.
Yes. Yeah.
I would have to say what I came away from Finding Me,
thinking I dis-- discovered anew about you
is that you have this indomitable courage.
It's courage.
You know Maya used to always say,
"Courage is the most important of the virtues
because without it, you cannot practice anything."
And in here, Finding Me, you talk about courage is the real cure.
So there was a… there was a point in your life
where you had decided that you were just gonna be a teacher,
and you were not gonna act, even though you loved it… you loved it.
And share with everyone how you started to feel depressed.
There was a sadness that came over you
because you were not doing the thing that you knew you needed to do.
Yeah, when I went to college, when I first entered college, um, I said I can't major in theater.
That is not a profession that can pay the bills.
And I really needed to pay my bills.
-[Oprah] Yeah. -'Cause I did not wanna be on welfare.
I wanted to not be what my… what I felt my parents were.
Yeah. [Viola] And so then I fell into a great depression
in denying that creative spirit in me
until I think my sister Deloris said,
"Why aren't you majoring in theater, Viola?"
And I said, "Because I can't make any money doing that, Deloris."
She said, "But that's what you love to do. That's who you are."
And, you know, what you begin to understand is that whole Anne Lamott quote, which is,
"All courage is, is fear said with prayers."
[Viola] That… I understood that the fear was not gonna go away.
That, "Viola, there is a huge chance that maybe it's not gonna land, and it's not gonna work,
that maybe it's not gonna land, and it's not gonna work,
but dangonnit, it's worth the try."
Dangonnit.
-[Viola] You know? -Yes.
Yeah.
[Oprah] Viola electrified the stages of Rhode Island College,
graduating in 1988 with a degree in theater.
Because she could only afford just one application fee for graduate school,
she auditioned for one of the most prestigious programs,
Juilliard, and got in.
Three years after graduating from Juilliard,
Viola made her Broadway debut in August Wilson's, Seven Guitars.
Her rave reviews put her on the next path to television and movies.
What's your name?
It's got nothing to do with me, but that offer, he was a part of it.
[Oprah] When did you realize, Viola, that being on stage or acting was the path to healing for you?
that being on stage or acting was the path to healing for you?
Oh, the minute I started doing it.
The minute I did the first skit when I was nine years old, I realized
it had the ability to heal me.
All the things I couldn't express in my life,
if I expressed it on stage would be celebrated.
[Viola] You play a character who's a runaway
who has trauma from parents,
and you expressed all of that onstage in a way that was honest and truthful,
then the audience celebrates it.
They celebrate seeing that level of humanity,
and you can't express that in your real life.
Oh, you can, but you risk being shamed.
So from the moment I started doing skits,
I felt like whatever I can't express in my life,
I could do it in a character.
I wanna just rip open what it means to be a human being
and show it to you in all its ugliness, beauty, contradictions, and complexity.
In that way, I think that's what saved my life.
That's what healed me.
It was my conduit of being able to take all the trauma, all the spew, everything,
and feed it through that vacuum of these characters
and give it to you.
Re-- recreated.
'Cause one of the things that you say is that,
'Cause one of the things that you say is that, "I'm not here…"
"I-I'm not here to create some fantasy."
Your job, as you see it as an actor, is to show us to ourselves.
-Absolutely. -[Oprah] Yeah. Absolutely.
-And not the politically correct self. -[Oprah] Yeah.
Don’t you think it ever crossed my mind to want to know other men?
That I wanted to lay up somewhere and forget about my responsibilities?
That I wanted someone to make me laugh so I can feel good?
[Viola] Those stories that nobody wants to tell.
But I held on to you, Troy.
I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams,
and I buried them inside you…
[Viola] You know-- [Oprah] That's why you let snot run with Rose, when the snot was running.
[Oprah] That's why you let snot run with Rose, when the snot was running.
[Oprah] That's why when the snot was running in Fences you just say,
"That's what's happening with Rose. I'm gonna let it roll." Right?
Absolutely. I think everybody moves through life fighting to be seen.
Sometimes even by themselves, to themselves.
And the bravery for an actor is to look at a moment.
I did it with How To Get Away With Murder.
I said, "Listen,
I'm getting ready for bed."
"My husband is cheating on me." [chuckling]
-I mean, it's a melodrama. Right? -[Oprah] Yes.
So I can make a choice in this moment
of doing the TV thing,
which is to keep my beautiful hair weave and wig and my makeup
and just turn around and give him that one-line zinger,
or I can inject something in here.
Something that every woman who's sitting there on their couch
with the retainers, and their rollers, and no makeup--
-In our socks. Yeah. -And, you know, in socks…
can look at this and somehow feel some level of connection to this story.
So let me take the wig off.
[Viola] Let me take the makeup off because in doing that,
what I'm presenting you with is not the character of Annalise,
but the woman that is Annalise.
[Oprah] Wow. And I read that it was you who insisted that that happen in that scene.
And I read that it was you who insisted that that happen in that scene.
-[Viola] Yes, it was. -[Oprah] Yes.
What you wrote is, "Annalise Keating released in me the obstacles blocking me
from realizing my worth and power as a woman."
"If I were to mark the first time I fully used my voice,
it was in How to Get Away with Murder."
"That role liberated me."
What was it about Annalise that helped you step into your full power?
Because she was all the things that people said, not only I wasn't,
but people who look like me weren't.
You're not sexual. No one's gonna find you attractive.
You're probably not having sex 'cause who would wanna… who would, um, desire you?
This was happening… this was nine years ago.
So people were saying that nine years ago?
Absolutely. I always… [laughing]
Yes, they were.
And… And that's why it was liberating because it absolutely is not true.
And that's why it was liberating because it absolutely is not true.
Listen, just a fantasy of mine,
that there is any number of people who are sitting at home
waiting to be a part of the story.
To see themselves.
To feel some level of validation.
And I felt that Annalise was a perfect way for me to be able to do that.
Okay. I wanna get to… to Julius because he's such a…
has been such a… He changed your whole life. Everything changed.
So let's get to the story where you…
You were talking to a friend and you said,
"I can't believe I… I keep running into all these assholes."
And she said, "Well, maybe you should look at yourself." -[Viola] Yeah. -Right?
And then you had a friend who told you to go home and pray for who you wanted.
-[Viola] Mm-hmm. -The kind of man you wanted.
And you actually got on your knees and you asked God for…
A big Black man. I said because he said, "Viola, even…
He said, "Even the vacuous stuff. Just put it all in there." "Looks, everything."
I said, "Really? With God? I got to tell him that."
He's like, "Yes. You gotta put it all out there."
He was like, "Be careful."
And I went I got on my knees,
and I did. I said, "I want a big Black man from the south
who's probably been married before, has kids,
'cause I don't want any pressure in that department.
Someone who's maybe been an actor who understands the artistic community.
Someone who goes to church and loves God. I said, "If you give me that, I'll start going to church, God."
I said, "If you give me that, I'll start going to church, God." "I really will."
"I… I'm… I'm committed to it."
[laughs] And then I signed off just like writing a letter.
And three and a half weeks later, I met Julius from Texas.
Ex-football player, 'cause actually that's one of the things I put on--
-[Oprah] You asked for a football player. -[Viola] A football player. Athlete.
Ex- football player, been married. Raised his children on his own.
Was an actor.
Invited me to church.
And, um,
I thought to myself,
"Whoa."
Did you know immediately that he is what you'd prayed for?
-Yeah! -[Oprah] You did?
[Viola] I went home. I was amazed.
I started calling.
Especially… My friend Patrice, especially.
I said, "Patrice." "I met a man."
[Viola] And she said, "Girl no." I said, "Yeah." "I really think I met somebody."
And then I made the connection with her too. I told her everything.
I was shocked. Sort of like magic.
Um, yeah.
[Oprah] Your life hasn't been the same since the two of you actually became bonded together.
since the two of you actually became bonded together.
[Viola] It has not been the same. [Oprah] That's why this book is so important.
I called up Gayle. I go, "You need to do what Viola did."
"You need to get down on your knees." "You need to pray and ask for what you want."
But also looking for the kind of life he has led before you.
I was in therapy at the time, and I remember my therapist just saying,
"Viola, find someone who loves you."
"Just find someone who loves you."
And I remember saying that to Julius too.
"I'm just looking for someone who'd just lay down their life for me, that loves me."
He's like, "I love you."
And I remember we both stopped, and I looked at him, and he looked at me.
-Aw. -[Viola] You know? He was like, "I'm all those things, V. I am."
And then we… we made something to eat like we'd usually do. [laughing]
You say there are moments in your life that absolutely live up to the hype.
And one of those moments certainly was the adoption of Genesis.
[Oprah] How did it change you as a woman?
In 2011, Viola and her husband, Julius,
adopted a baby girl who was living in foster care
in Viola's home state of Rhode Island.
They named her "Genesis."
Today Genesis is 11.
[Viola] Oh man, Genesis.
You know, to live for something bigger than yourself.
I mean, that's what it was.
The first time she looked at me and squeezed me
and made me believe that I could be her mom,
and I could mother her and…
And that, sort of, just really pure love that only children can give you.
[Viola] And I'll tell you one thing.
All of the tools you need to raise a little girl,
the affirmations, all those things,
while you're doing that, you're healing yourself.
[Oprah] Yeah. My next question is,
how have you navigated raising a daughter
when you never got what you needed
when you were being raised?
It's my opportunity to be able to do that.
And so does it feel like giving that back to yourself?
-[Viola] Absolutely. -Yes.
Little Viola is always running around.
You know, sort of guiding me.
Yeah. And also Genesis being very different from who I am
is helping me also see myself in a different way.
[Oprah] You wrote this on social media about your own mother, May Alice.
You said, "This is the woman who birthed me, loves me, and would die for me."
"Our bond runs deeper than anything man-made or given."
"No one can love you like your mama loves you."
"Not even the love of your life."
So what did you learn from your own mother
that you have now been able to pass on and transfer to Genesis?
Number one, that I believe my mom did the best she could with what she knew.
And also,
my mom is very smart.
My mom sees people and she sees through people.
Oh, she could read them, right? She's one who can read them.
-Yeah. -[Oprah] She could read 'em. Yeah.
I appreciate that.
Yeah. When I talk to you about Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,
You said, one of the ways you go into examining a character,
one of the many ways,
is by asking, "What is this character living for?"
Yeah. [Oprah] So I end our conversation today with,
what are you, Viola Davis, now living for?
First of all, I'm living for my peace and my joy.
I am.
I wanna be happy in my life.
And I know happiness is a journey.
It's not a destination.
I know it's speckled with bad,
but I wanna feel some level of peace and joy in my life.
Absolutely.
To help people to live better.
Absolutely.
You have done that.
In finding yourself, you've helped all of us
who hear your story, who read your story,
who see you be the light you are…
-Thank you. -…find a part of ourselves.
And I thank you so much.
I'm so excited for people to read Finding Me.
It is astonishing
what you have been able to endure.
And for us to see you to come into this other side of yourself,
makes it possible for us to believe it's possible for ourselves.
So, thank you.
-Thank you, Oprah. [chuckling] -[Oprah] Thank you, Viola.
I just wanna say to you all, Finding Me is available on April 26th,
I just wanna say to you all, Finding Me is available on April 26th, wherever books are sold.
And the audio book too. [in Viola's voice] Viola in her world-famous Viola voice…
[in normal voice] …reads her own story that you all need to hear.
So I hope you'll get a book.
And when you get it, buy one for a friend,
'cause you're gonna want to talk about it with a friend.
That's what I did with Gayle.
BUT GANG FIGHTS BETWEEN INSTITUTES WERE ALSO RISING FOR UNKNOWN REASONS.
THESE FIGHTS WERE ROOTED IN FALSE BELIEFS AND TOXIC CULTURES,
TOGETHER WITH THE CHAOTIC TEENAGE YEARS IN WHICH ANGER RUNS AMOK.
THE 4 INSTITUTES NOTORIOUSLY KNOWN FOR GANG FIGHTS WERE IN, CHOL, KANOK AND BU.
INTRA ALUMNI
You don’t have to go, Dad.
Why wouldn't I?
It’s Father’s Day.
You look like hell.
-Amm. -Damn stink of alcohol.
You came home at dawn.
It’s the Father’s Day ceremony at school,
not Alcohol Day.
Amm.
Why?
What are you going to say now?
You are always like this, year after year.
Your pants have sweat stains all over them.
And look at your shoes.
You’d wear that junk to my school?
I'm ashamed.
Amm.
Amm.
MR. PUTTIPONG
Yes, Mr. Puttipong.
Billy, the concrete beam is not settling yet.
It can’t be, the guys just finished it at 4 a.m.
Where are you? Aren't you at the construction site?
Oh, damn!
Out of my way, damn it!
Come on.
Come on in. Come on.
I said get out of my way.
They are fighting out there. Where would I go?
I’m going to help my daughter.
Come on. Come.
Come on in. Come on.
-Run! -Go!
Jerk! Get off!
Amm!
Amm!
Amm.
Amm.
Amm.
Amm.
Please help!
Please help my daughter!
Ambulance!
Someone call an ambulance!
Hello.
I’m Suwicha, Inthira's teacher.
Remember me?
Mr. Pranott.
I sent the blueprint for project four last night.
Yes, sir. I owe you this time.
Thank you.
Amm, do I have to prepare for the parents’ meeting?
Students got into a gang fight again.
They are from two different vocational schools this time
and it was right in the middle of Samut Sakhon
with swords and homemade hand grenades involved.
There's a report that a soldier…
Teens these days…
What’s wrong with them?
They were charging at each other with long swords.
Like you’ve never done that.
The jurisdiction of Krathum Baen police station.
A soldier who was driving by…
Back then it was not like this.
It was not like this?
What was it like then?
Like real men?
I've never seen any technical student act like a real man.
-Amm… -You're telling me not to generalize.
The fact that I’m crippled,
isn’t it because of technical students like you?
1995
Hey, pay up.
I'm getting off.
Schmuck, does your tuition fee cover all bus fares?
You never pay your stuff, twat.
Oh, oh?
Mister,
other than caffeine,
only a good beating up gets me vibing.
What a jerk.
I had a look at you While you were sleeping
You seemed so innocent
Hey, Lupin.
Why are you so into singing?
Quit school and get a record deal already.
Oh damn! It’s not that I love singing, Billy.
I just love music,
so I keep rehearsing.
Stone Metal Fire have a concert at the end of the year.
I’m telling you, I’m going to shine.
Just watch me, you’ll be so high.
Yes, Lupin. I believe you.
You always had potential.
Only Jae Danupol is cooler than you.
The gig is at the end of the year, why the rush?
Come on, Billy.
You can’t spell the word "target"?
Targets are for attacks.
And I'm planning a big attack there.
Hey! CHOLs alert!
Old man, stop!
INs!
CHOLs!
CHOLs? We're INs!
Idiot, do one!
Let my friend show off!
Billy!
Get your medicine at the counter.
You are invincible. Where did you get the tattoo?
Invincible your ass.
Got 18 stitches on my back.
Billy.
Sorry…
that I was too late.
No. Why sorry?
If it hadn't been for you, Mod would have chopped me up.
You think too much.
Dad, hello…
You only bring me trouble.
Your brain
ever come up with something good?
See you.
Are you leaving?
See you tomorrow.
You can’t be mad at me, Au.
I’m here on time.
Da,
I've missed my period for two months now.
You serious?
Are you joking with me?
No, seriously.
I'm not messing with you about this.
It's not a joke, Da.
Don’t think too much.
Whatever happens, happens.
What about my parents?
You don't have to worry.
I’ll figure it out somehow.
I am responsible for this.
But it is a serious matter, Da.
It is serious to me as well.
Da, let’s get a taxi.
The Buranapons are all over the station.
If you have a girl around, they don't do it.
It would be despicable if they did.
Hey.
Walking with your head high.
Do you think you are Andy Lau?
Pickup, go home, get laid.
Don’t you have it all too easy?
You can have it easy.
But if you want it difficult,
you might get a bit sweaty.
It’s kind of hot around here.
Want a drink?
Okay.
Enough, you idiot. I’ll choke.
You come with a girl, drink up.
Whenever you come alone,
I’ll beat the crap out of you.
Hey.
Make way for Andy Lau.
Give me a cigarette.
Let’s eat.
Thanks, Mom.
-Mom -Yes.
Billy will stay with us for a while.
Sure, make yourself at home.
But… are you on a run?
No, I’m not.
I have a problem with my stepdad.
I’m kidding.
Da told me everything.
Just relax, son.
Thank you.
-Da. -Yes, Mom.
Why don’t you invite Au for dinner?
You know her dad is very strict.
She can’t stay out late.
A policeman’s daughter.
And you, make sure you use protection.
Respect her dignity.
Protect what?
Well, you know.
Au and I are not like that.
Come on, just do as I say.
Yes, Mom.
Let me answer the phone.
Mischievous, isn’t he?
You seem to be very close to him.
Yeah.
It’d be nice if you were my family.
All families are different.
It’s like this here.
Many are not.
You are a man now.
Stay with the present. Look toward the future.
Forget the past.
-Very wise. -Right.
TO INTRA WITH CONDOLENCES FROM CHOL
Are you sure, X?
Yeah, they usually hang around here.
What a smelly alley.
Are you sure Da is here?
Not sure.
But if he turns up,
it'll be this mofo's last day.
Turn off the engine.
Whoa. Those CHOLs.
What are they doing here?
Surely they are looking for trouble.
What the hell are you doing?
I’ve always wanted to face them.
Now I have a chance,
I'll welcome them with my number 12.
Forget the drugs, I'd rather hit them.
When I shoot them, you take off. Okay?
My name is goddamn Yad!
Let's go!
My friend? My friend?
Where are you going, coward?
Who sent you here? Scumbag!
Damn, Mod.
Enough, Mod!
He’s going to die.
Stop!
Go!
Do one, scumbag!
Go!
Like a drama that you have to act
It’s because of some kind of force
The force of love, lust, so powerful
That commands you to do anything
Enough with your force of love!
Idiot freeloaders!
What a waste of my stuff!
Aunty, music is drug prevention.
Right, Lupin.
Like this alcohol you are drinking is not addictive?
What would you know? It’s medicinal.
Doc told me it's good for circulation.
Why did you sell it to me then?
For you it’s like charity.
My shop will be shut down because of you.
Damn!
Jeez.
Honorable freeloader, have you heard of it?
So fierce.
For the SMF gig this year,
I have my new Converse to attract chicks.
They’re going to be thrilled.
Where did you get the money?
He snatched some Scholls from the mall yesterday.
Got five pairs.
What did you do with five pairs?
Hey,
Billy.
Look at those…
Scholl.
Mint condition.
Just watch me.
Gotcha. Gotcha.
Kiddo.
Hey, kid!
Hey, kid.
Kiddo!
Oh!
Pretending to ignore me?
I guess I can’t play nice.
Seems like you need Arahan palms.
Kid, you have nice shoes.
Can I have them?
Come on! Take them off!
Damn.
Very good. I love obedient young men.
Let’s go.
Bro.
How are they?
Brother.
They smell right.
Yeah.
-I mean you, jackass. -What?
Can I have 40 baht for more games?
You wasted my time, I thought you’d be tough.
So you bought them, Mr. Customer.
Damn.
But I didn’t have to go to the shop, right?
Oh, damn.
Who is coming to the SMF concert this year?
School girls maybe? Damn!
Billy, what are you talking about?
We are the flashiest.
Listen to me carefully.
There must be Lupin with INs.
"Lupin." Do you get it?
Billy.
I think the CHOLs and KANOKs will be there.
Let them bind together,
I’ll take care of that.
Damn.
Also KANOKs and PAYUs.
Those scumbags are violent.
Are you scared, you dork?
Let those losers come,
I’ll slap their heads one by one.
Mr. Customer,
what did you call Billy again?
A dork.
Loudmouth.
Schmuck. Dork.
Hell.
It's for you, bro.
I’ve got a Flirt Card.
How’s that?
"Can I have your number?"
Jealous, huh?
With my looks, girls can't help falling for me.
Is she pretty?
Of course, I wouldn’t do it if she wasn’t.
Guide me to that girl.
Sure.
-Let’s go. -Follow me.
Excuse me, guys.
You can compete in a boat race,
but you can’t compete in luck.
I gotta go for now.
Come on, dork.
-Such a bully. -Hurry.
-So full of crap. -Crap talker.
Where is she, huh?
It's the end of the line for you here.
Go. Go home.
I’m Lupin of INTRA.
What do you want me to do?
You'll get your ass kicked, son of a bitch!
Scumbag!
Schmuck!
Schmuck!
I said stop.
Don’t run, damn it.
Don’t you get it? I said stop.
Where are you running to?
Heck!
Hey, KANOKs!
Billy, get down!
What the hell are you doing?
Go!
Billy, you get hit?
I'm okay.
Lupin?
Holy hell! Lupin!
Scumbag!
Lupin!
Dad.
Can I have some money?
We're going school camping in Kanchanaburi.
Sure, are you staying overnight?
How many days, so I know how much?
Four days.
I’ll prepare you some coats.
It might be cold there.
Take my camera.
You can take some pictures with your friends.
Alright.
You should go longer.
Not as tough as your tongue.
Can you please calm down?
He might have thought it through.
You'd better shut up.
There is no point being nice to him.
I put your stuff in the dog cage.
If you want to come back,
stay in the dog cage!
Isn't that too harsh?
To discipline him.
He got his dad’s vile blood.
Don’t talk crap about my dad!
-Billy! -What are you gonna do?
It’s my house. What are you gonna do?
You think you are tough?
I beg you, please.
Why? Can’t I discipline your ex's son?
You!
-Enough, Dad. Dad! -Billy!
Get your stuff out of my house.
Don’t ever come back!
Get out!
Billy, I’m sorry.
You don’t need to apologize.
It’s my fault that I'm your son.
Just stay away for a while.
Billy!
You took Au home today?
Yes, Mom.
Do her parents know about you?
They do, but…
they don’t really like me.
Especially her dad.
Are you serious about her?
Of course I am.
Like really serious?
Then prove yourself.
Yes, Mom.
Da.
Is that Billy?
Yes, I’ll go see him.
As soon as you got back?
Forget it. Get inside.
Mom.
-Hello, Mom. -Hi.
Can I…?
Yes, make yourself at home.
Thank you.
Have you eaten?
No.
I’ll make you an omelet. Come.
-Billy. -Huh?
I have something to tell you.
What is it?
Au is pregnant.
Holy crap.
What are you going to do?
I’ll take care of them. I’m a real man.
But you are still in school.
You have no job.
But I have my hands and feet.
It’s my child so I’ll take care of it.
Does your mom know?
No.
I’ll find the right time.
How about her family?
Not yet.
That’s a big problem.
Don't go, I'm begging you
I'm begging you to stop singing already.
You have been singing all day.
Are you going to the Kai Pang concert, channel 7?
Are you, Da, Billy?
Of course.
It’s Pang we are talking about.
Yeah.
How about you, Da?
Don’t tell me you are not going.
If you won’t, I won’t.
Can I just go to the SMF concert?
I’ll pass on this one.
Why is that?
Or you don’t like alternative music?
Are you anxious about Au?
Yeah.
See, Billy? I knew it.
Did Au break up with you?
I told you, she's stuck-up.
I’m good at reading people.
Wait.
No break up.
Au is pregnant, idiot.
Huh? Au is pregnant?
Damn.
How did it happen?
They stared at each other and she got pregnant.
What a stupid question, idiot.
That’s not what I meant.
I meant how did you let her get pregnant?
I gave you condoms, why didn’t you use them?
Do her parents know?
Not yet.
Just calm down, don’t overreact.
Read my lips,
don’t dwell on the past
and don’t long for the future
or you’ll lose your present.
That works for me.
So in the present, you go to the concert with me.
Yes, Lupin.
I hope in the present,
you don’t get kicked out like last time.
Snap out of it, man.
To be frank…
I’ll stay through to the end.
This is how you snap.
Come on, I really want you to be there.
Hey, don’t stress.
We’ll think about that later.
It’s for the Kai Pang concert,
let’s just go.
Fine, I’ll go.
That's my friend.
"Stay through to the end."
How’s that, you idiot?
So you said you would not get kicked out, Lupin?
Scumbag! Those CHOLs really got on my nerves,
so I have to give it to them.
I told you I shouldn’t have come.
We're the BUs from Bang Na
No one bats an eye We're the unfortunate tech students
Ministry of Education couldn't care less
They say we're punks
Heck! There are a hundred BUs ahead.
We're diligently repeating the year
Making sure the world knows We're despicable
We're BUs, BUs!
What do we do?
Just get on with it.
CHOLs!
Damn, so many of them.
Seems like they want to eat my foot.
They want a show, let them come.
We never know.
The BUs might run away.
But leave the CHOLs to me.
Let's have some fun.
Is everybody okay? Get hit?
BANG SUE POLICE STATION
Stop!
What are you doing?
Face down!
Hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back.
Are you tough?
Get up!
Everybody, up! Now!
Officer, take them to the van.
Go!
Calm down. Go further in. Up you go.
I’ll whip your ass.
Move.
-What are you doing? -Why?
-Get on. -Sit down or I’ll whip your ass.
Hey.
-Jerk! -Billy!
Sit down!
Want to try me?
Still fighting? Hey.
I'll hit you.
So gritty.
You have nothing else to do?
You thinking what I’m thinking?
Of course, moron.
I was arrested once.
I get booked again, I’ll be gone for long.
-What are you going to do? -I don’t know.
Let me handle it.
Tell your guys to be prepared.
You'd better make it, jackass.
Damn you. Always get on my nerves.
I’ve despised you for so long.
-Want to go one-on-one with me? -Stop!
I said stop.
Officer, I'm done.
Can I go one-on-one with this jerk?
He’s doing my head in.
Fine. But the loser…
will get beaten up. I warn you.
You moron. Loose mouth.
Do you know channel 7 Muay Thai?
I’ll make you the highlight of the day.
You're Channel 7?
Then I’m the Dark Knight, schmuck!
Damn. If you are both from…
Channel 7 and Dark Knight,
Then I’m Songchai Ratanasubun?
Fight.
-IN! -CHOL!
Quiet!
When are you going to start?
Go on.
One…
Two!
Damn! Still counting?
Annoying as hell!
-Three! -Hey!
-Run! -Go!
-What the hell? -Stop!
Sit down!
Sit down!
Hey, guys.
Let me ask you this,
why do you guys fight?
What is it for?
I see you guys always having street fights.
If there were no idiots like you in this country,
it would be much more developed.
The three of you…
have you ever asked yourselves
why you have to fight?
Year after year, I've always seen you fight.
Just use your brain. Think hard.
"Year after year, you fight."
Like you police are good, what a jerk.
Can you answer his question though?
Why do we fight?
Sure.
Why then?
You are the BUs.
This jackass is the INs.
And I’m the CHOLs.
That’s sensible.
You have a point. I agree.
If I was not in the BUs, you were not in the CHOLs,
and that jackass was not in the INs,
would we still fight?
Young people in the US fight all the time.
They don’t even have patriotism for the institute,
they are just gang members.
All drug dealers.
How do you know?
Have you been there?
Piss off.
All I know is every country has their own problems.
It depends on how they solve their problems.
And what's the problem in the US?
Are you stupid?
Why?
Don’t you have cable TV in your area?
You are a jerk.
What’s wrong with you?
I really want to know.
It’s poverty.
Poverty?
How many cans of glue have you sniffed?
And what's the problem in this country?
How would I know, slimeball?
If I did, I’d be in parliament.
So do you or do you not know?
What is wrong with you? Why so quiet?
POLICE STATION WE PROTECT AND SERVE THE PEOPLE
Your parents are here to bail you out.
I’m sure they are not mine.
My parents.
Please sign an acknowledgement here.
Yes.
I’m not here to bail him out, I want to press charges.
What did you say?
Your son is a piece of crap.
He should be in jail as discipline
and know what being miserable is like.
Officer, he stole my camera.
If you really want to report your son,
file a report with the officer in charge.
Let’s go.
Wait, you can’t do that.
Stay out of this.
Billy.
I’m sorry.
You told him about the camera?
I’m sorry.
Mom,
let me ask you one thing.
What is it?
Why did you have me?
It’s my fault.
I’m sorry.
-Hi, boss. -Hi.
Are you doing well?
If I was doing well, I wouldn’t be here.
What did you do this time?
War with the INs at the Pang’s concert.
They got me busted.
Only three of you got busted?
This scumbag is BU, that jackass is IN.
How about you?
I’m okay.
The technical boys at house 4.
House 2 is for stray local guys.
Yad and his friends were busted for drugs and guns.
The whole gang is in here.
Don’t they fight?
The locals hate technical boys.
Damn right they do.
They outnumber us.
Clashed with the DONs since the first day.
These guards are mean.
They punish offenders severely.
Isn’t this Mr. Oh the CHOLs?
Are you here on vacation?
Never thought I would meet you here.
Yeah, I’m on vacation, hunting animals.
Oh, hunting animals?
What kind of animals?
We have them all here.
The crappy kind, I’m never bored of looking at.
Well, it’s not fun time now
because we hunt at night.
There is an IN guy here.
I’ve always wanted to chew you.
Let’s see if you live up to your reputation.
What the hell are you looking at?
What the hell are you looking at?
-Scumbag! -Hey.
-Slimeball. -Dirtbag!
This one is quite fierce.
You might want to get some jabs.
-Jerk. -Stop.
-Stop. -Don’t worry, you’ll have your chance.
But I’m hungry now. Got to eat.
I’ll save my dessert for later tonight.
-You slimeball! -Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Hey, you are not the IN here!
You are not the IN here!
Look at those creeps.
Look!
They hunt in groups. They are not like you!
You think the military police are cruel,
these guards are even worse.
I thought the CHOLs were fearless.
Let’s beat the crap out of them, see if they are tough.
Next time,
I don’t think they'll have the guts.
Damn.
Hey.
Don’t you know the rule?
What rule?
The big guy showers near the tap.
Is that so, schmuck?
It is not mentioned in the text book.
Then put it in your skull,
because the text books…
don’t tell you everything.
Well, go ahead, I’ll wait.
Sure.
I thought you were tough, schmuck.
Hey.
But in my book,
this is what it taught me.
Here come Social Studies.
Son of a bitch!
What the hell are you doing?
Who started this crap? Say it!
Or you all will be punished.
I did.
I started it.
Me too.
It’s done.
Is it?
Anything else?
If not, you'd better go home.
Alright.
Dad, if you need anything, please let me know.
Who’s your dad?
I'd never have a son like you.
Da, you should get back.
You can come again later.
Don’t come again ever
and stay away from my daughter.
Why do you talk like that?
Why can’t I?
I say what I like.
You have a problem?
But Au and I are seeing each other.
So?
You are together then, or what?
Au is my daughter.
Who I want her to date, is my decision.
Go. Get lost.
Da, please leave, trust me.
Goodbye, Mom.
Dad…
Au is pregnant.
What did you say?
I said…
Au is pregnant.
You impregnated my daughter?
Dad!
You punk. Son of a bitch. You piece of crap.
Da, listen to me, please go home.
Get out of my house!
And never come back again
or I will kill you!
Go!
Do one!
Da, please go home.
Goddamnit!
So many nice men…
Yet you choose this jerk!
Why?!
You caused trouble on your first day.
Two times for now
and you have to clean up the toilet tomorrow.
If you still cause more trouble,
there will be more coming.
Who will be the first?
I will.
Take a deep breath.
Deep breath.
Come on, one more.
Take a deep breath.
One last time, now you remember.
Come on.
Mom.
Are you hungry?
I cooked you some food.
Let’s eat.
Your favorite, stuffed bitter gourd soup.
What’s wrong, Mom?
What happened to you?
Why are you crying?
Did someone hurt you?
Today I met Aunt Duang Jai,
she invited you to Kik's graduation.
She doesn’t know that you…
Mom.
I’m sorry.
Mom.
Mom.
Damn it.
We were punished and still have to wash the toilet.
Why are you whining?
Why did you pick the smaller bucket?
You clean that zone, and this zone is mine.
Damn Oh.
You come to this zone, jerk.
They didn’t flush their crap. Damn!
Didn’t you start all of this?
Now we have to clean up crap.
You are the one who built it up.
You've had a go at him since we arrived.
Are you gonna talk crap or clean it?
I’m still in pain because of you.
Hurry up, scumbag.
Which room do you want me to wash? Let me help.
Were you just crying in the toilet?
What I do in the toilet is my business.
I’m a grown-up.
Just get on with it.
What the hell? You argue like kids.
Where’s my brush?
Why do you go to IN?
And you?
Why do you go to CHOL?
I asked you first.
Seriously, I have no idea why I went to CHOL.
This is strange.
We wear different uniforms out there.
But if I was not studying at CHOL,
I might end up like Yad.
No future.
Because we hold onto the institute's name.
I get to see my mom's tears.
Damn it.
I don’t know.
I think it’s the virtue of this.
Skills that teach us to survive.
People fight in all lines of work and study.
By the way,
if we all meet outside,
will we fight?
I don’t know.
We know each other now.
We'll just try to avoid each other in public.
If we can’t,
we’ll meet later to settle it.
All right,
friend?
Da, when will Billy get out?
In a few days.
Did his family visit him?
His mom sent letters and some money.
Poor Billy.
How did he manage to go back to school?
There's only one semester left.
Mom.
Billy will have to stay with us for a while.
Billy’s mom will send the money.
Sure, no problem.
Well?
Well?
Well…
I want to ask you…
what do you think about Au?
What do you mean? I don’t understand.
I mean, do you like Au or not?
Well… if you love her and think she is good for you,
then I love her too.
You gotta make a decision by yourself.
But…
is there something else?
No, nothing. I just want to know what you think.
I’ll wipe the plate.
-Hello, Mom. -Hello, Mom.
Hello.
Good luck.
Don’t come back here again.
-What's up? -What’s up, man?
Why are you here?
I’m sorry.
Please don’t be mad at me.
Take this money,
and finish your studies.
I’ll try to make things better with your stepdad.
We’ll be friends until we grow old
Share many memories from now on
Share sadness, happiness, dreams
Laugh and cry together
Until that day comes
Until we die
My turn.
Until that day, the day we die
Awesome.
Billy, you are really good at song writing.
It’s just a hobby, for Lupin.
Lupin?
I see that he likes singing.
One day he can be a singer.
I don’t think he can.
But you, maybe after graduation.
Nah.
Hey, the SMF concert is in a few days.
What is your decision?
I don’t know.
How about you?
You go, I go.
If you don’t, me neither.
Okay, I’ll go.
Really?
Yes, it’s the last gig before we graduate.
Damn! Attaboy.
We’ll have a great time.
Why?
Lupin has been preparing since the start of the year.
-Our Lupin? -Yeah.
He talks about this concert every day.
Prepares his costume early.
Yeah, he’s quite something.
Billy.
Let me ask you something.
What?
When my baby is born,
what will your gift be?
I don’t know yet.
But I’ll have a gift for sure.
I’ll be back.
Hello.
Hello, Da. It’s Au.
What are you doing?
Playing guitar with Billy.
How are you, Au?
What are you doing? Did you eat?
Da.
Have you told your mom that I’m pregnant?
Not yet.
I will tell her after the SMF concert.
The SMF concert…
is it that important to you?
Au, it’s the last thing with my friends.
Don’t sulk. It’s not a big deal.
Right.
It’s not a big deal.
I got to go.
Okay, Au.
Au…
I love you.
Sweet dreams.
It was Au.
She doesn’t want me to go.
What will you do?
It’s one last time. Come on.
After my baby is born, I will…
just be a good father.
Okay, let’s do it.
IN
One word that makes the world delightful
It turns bitterness into sweetness
One word that makes you cry
That takes all your hopes It makes you want to die
That makes you a good person Like no one has ever seen
That makes you a bad person Like you have never been
One night that will make you enchanted
For no reason, you forget to breathe
Like a drama that you have to act
It’s because of some kind of force
The force of love, lust, so powerful
That commands you to do anything
The force of love, lust, so powerful
That commands you to do anything…
INTRA
Look at Lupin from INs.
Mod, look at him.
It's gonna be so goddamn fun!
The force of love, lust, so powerful
That commands you to do anything
The force of love, lust, so powerful
That commands you to do anything…
Hello, Mom.
Is Da home?
The force of love, lust, so powerful
That commands you to do anything
Anything, anything
Love makes you do anything
We all smile to everyone But it’s different in our mind
People seem friendly But they are not real
Look at ourselves, we realize
Deep down we don’t Want to be less than anyone
People fight for everything
Do everything to get what they want
We give up and become losers
We are generous and become victims
Stop trusting and be more pessimistic
Prevent it before dangers get to us…
That mofo Lupin is asking for it.
Very well. I like it.
Hey.
Paranoid, do I think too much, doc?
Paranoid, I’m insane, aren’t I, doc?
Paranoid, it’s curable, isn’t it, doc?
Paranoid, I’m afraid You’ll prolong my treatment
Did a good job, get praised and rewarded
It is actually misleading
When useful, you are always wanted
When useless, they replace you
Everybody is looking For their own benefit…
INs!
INs!
CHOLs!
Paranoid, do I think too much, doc?
KANOKs!
KANOKs!
BUs!
Come on.
Come on, scumbag.
KANOKs!
I’m afraid you’ll prolong my treatment…
IN!
You're gonna get it, schmuck.
INs!
Doc!
Please help. Doc!
This way!
This way.
Family waits here.
Goddamnit!
I told you. Who shone tonight?
INs!
Did you see their faces?
Mod must have been so mad.
He deserves it.
It could have been worse.
Yeah.
I told you, where there are INs, there is…
Billy.
Lupin, you dork.
Let me call Au.
You are a dork.
Ta-da!
What are you doing?
Counselling.
-I’m a watchdog. -Moron.
I can talk to my girlfriend.
Don’t drink it all.
Hello, Au?
What did you say, Au?
Hey!
Hey.
Follow him.
-Da! -Da!
-Da! -Da!
Da!
-Da! -Da!
-Da. -Au!
-Da. -Au!
Au!
Au!
1144, please state your pager number.
Seenoom messaged that he saw Da the IN
and two friends on his street.
Au!
Au!, It’s me, Da!
Au!
Hey, Da.
What are you doing?
Come on, if you want to die.
You'd better go back.
I won’t.
You’ll be charged with trespassing and sex with a minor.
Go ahead.
If you want to get me arrested, do it.
But I’ll tell the police
that you will take Au to get an abortion.
Dad!
You can’t get rid of my baby.
You don’t have the right to tell me what to do!
I do.
The baby is mine!
But Au is my daughter!
And I don’t want her to have a baby with you.
Look at yourselves.
You're like a bunch of dogs,
running around and biting people.
Dogs?
What's wrong with dogs?
Dogs love their puppies.
We are human.
We also have right to be fathers!
Do you think I'm heartless?
Yes!
Because people like you have no future.
Can you tell me what the future looks like?
Have you ever seen it?
Although we have no future, we still have hearts.
Tell me the truth, Au.
Do you really want to get an abortion?
Da.
If I keep the baby,
can you really take care of us?
I’m only 17.
You are still in school,
you don’t even have a job.
So for the baby and myself…
what will it be like?
Can you tell me?
I don’t think we're ready.
You know, before all of this…
I never thought of anything like this.
Until today…
it’s today, Da.
You went to the concert.
You always go and fight.
And you…
you still think I can rely on you?
Can I, Da?
Au. Please calm down.
I understand what you said, but…
can I ask you only one thing?
Please keep the baby, I’ll take care of it.
You will?
You can’t even take care of yourself.
How can you take care of a baby?
Enough.
No matter what you think
or what you say,
I’ll never let my daughter
stoop down to your level.
My level? What's low?
You want her to have an abortion, that’s the lowest!
Enough with this.
Do you want to die? Come at me!
-Come on. -No.
Dad. Enough.
No.
No, calm down.
Dad.
I’m sorry that I snapped at you.
I’m sorry about the crappy things I said.
But the only thing I ask,
can you let Au keep the baby?
After she delivers the baby, I’ll raise it.
I’ll be responsible for everything.
And she still has to bear it for nine months.
You only think about your own benefit.
When her tummy gets bigger,
Au, I and my whole family
have to be embarrassed.
Mod and his friends, Billy.
Billy!
I really don’t know what to do, Dad. I really don’t.
The only thing I know,
please let Au keep the baby.
Please, and after she gives birth,
she doesn’t have to do anything else.
I will never come to see her again.
Please let her keep the baby.
Have mercy on it. Spare the baby’s life.
Da, why are you bowing to him?
This idiot doesn’t deserve your respect.
-Billy! -Dad, no!
-Lupin! -Mofo!
I said stop. Stop now.
Stop now! Stop.
What would you like me to do?
What would I do?
The way I beg and fall to my knees, everything is for my child.
It’s for my child, you get it?
Dad.
I know.
I’m useless. I’m an idiot, a piece of crap.
This is the best my life can do.
But my child's life…
please let it live.
Mod.
Even my friend goes to technical college
and seems like a crappy person
but ultimately the baby is his.
Please don’t force her to get an abortion.
We beg you.
Let’s go.
Finally, after three years.
Yeah, we graduated.
I never thought that we would graduate.
We've had so much fun in the past three years.
We went through so much,
all the bad and the good.
Oranges, Mom.
Yeah.
Three years…
I hadn’t slept well until you got this.
Shed so many tears.
You should look for higher education.
Get well paid so you can afford for your child.
I can still help with the expense at the moment.
Thank you, Mom.
Thank you.
He graduated from that crappy institute?
He's quite alright.
If you could go back in time,
would you go to vocational college?
That is an odd question.
Who would be able to go back in time?
Even the river doesn’t flow back.
Billy, the water flows in one direction in high tide,
it flows back the other way in low tide.
It will be the same tomorrow.
You idiot.
So deep.
If I could really choose.
If I could go back in time,
I wouldn’t choose this path.
I feel you, my friend.
But we can’t go back to fix anything.
Life is up and down just like the river.
Look at it that way.
Hell, yeah!
Even deeper than me.
Hey, come support me at the military draft.
Of course we’ll come.
Yeah.
Lupin, have you seen Rhang lately?
How is he? Quit using drugs?
He said he’d come to my military draft.
He’ll leave Wat Thamkrabok rehab in two weeks
but his dad won’t let him go back to IN.
He'll send him to Sripatum university.
So he won't go back to the same environment.
We did it!
Rhang, give me.
Wow! Damn, super black.
-Pass. -That’s awesome.
I got it.
You are going in?
The black ballot!
-How's that? -Attaboy.
Red ballot, mofo!
-I'm so pissed. -Damn.
Those scumbags are noisy.
God damn…
He's going solo.
Two officers locked my hands.
Why?
Stop me from running away? I don’t know.
-You're a lucky son of a bitch. -Sure I am.
Noisy bitches!
Why the hell are you barking?
Oh, Billy from IN?
Your friend is damn lucky.
But you and me seem out of luck.
Wanna show me what you got, bitch?
I’ll see you outside.
Who is that?
Such a kickable face.
Yad, a local stray.
From Central Ladprao and picks fights with technical boys?
Yeah.
How do you know him?
At the juvie.
I fought with him there.
Don’t mind him.
He has nothing on us.
-Let's have hot pot. -Yeah.
Your treat, Lupin.
Yeah, your turn.
I have 20 baht.
Jerk.
Hello?
Where are you?
You are so late.
Lupin could have gone to boot camp.
How was it?
Black ballot.
We gotta celebrate.
Where?
In the hood.
Just come join us, stop asking.
Page Rhang when you get here.
He’ll pick you up.
Rhang is there?
Everybody is here but you.
Just come, stop asking.
Yeah.
I saw Mod too.
Mod who?
I’ll crush him.
Just hurry, Rhang has to rush back to rehab.
What rehab, you idiot?
Let me talk to him.
Hello, Da.
Hurry up.
See you there.
All right?
Yeah, see you, man.
Drink up all you want, my treat.
Damn.
Oh, I saw Lupin today.
When I walked out,
I saw Billy and his friends.
So what?
I’m just telling you.
You know Billy, don’t you?
Yeah, I know him.
We became good friends in juvie.
But they are always the INs, aren’t they?
And I am the one who slashed him.
But I’m a CHOL,
I know what you are thinking.
But to me, friends and institute are as important.
Billy was there so you didn’t want to fight?
I was gonna go after Da,
Billy and I would settle things later.
You were there, weren’t you?
You know what happened.
Yeah, I understand.
I’m kidding. Don’t think too much.
We did the right thing that day.
It would be despicable if we fought them.
Da was on his knees crying,
who would want to hurt him?
But I won’t spare him next time.
Where’s the restaurant?
I don’t have that 20 baht anymore,
already spent it on cigarettes.
-You are always like this. -Lame.
-This one. -My parents don’t give me money so often.
They say the hot pot is really good here.
There is a jukebox too.
I told you it’s the best here. All kinds of music.
-Hit songs, Grammy… -Sony.
Sony, Grammy,
RS, FourS, they have it all.
Bakery too.
-Come on. -Do you have two baht?
Put some music on.
Do you see that, Billy?
Hello.
A table for three?
Please come in, please.
Seeing their faces made me lose my appetite.
They should put our feet in their mouth rather than the meal.
Agreed.
They should rather eat our feet.
What now, Billy? Go somewhere else?
Order,
one grilled beef.
Whiskey, two waters, one bucket of ice.
Calm down, Lupin. Keep it cool.
Leave now, we're losers.
They’ll talk crap about us.
What are you gonna do?
Clear up.
How?
Don’t know.
Jerk.
Your order is coming.
Here.
Rhang, get me the whiskey.
Oh,
let me drink with you guys.
About that night.
Looks like we’ll have a hot pot with feet.
That sounds yummy.
You might have watched too much Dreams Come True.
Coming here wishing to drink with us?
I’m not as generous as Mr. Traipop.
What do you want me to do?
If you want to drink with us,
make a drink for us first,
are you okay with that?
Which one is your glass?
Straight? Mine is.
That's good.
Straight, pure with nothing else.
Just like your heart.
It's okay.
Thanks to you guys.
Wait.
You finished your drink, let me make another one.
Thanks, man.
What did you talk about with them?
Grilled beef is coming.
I thought you’d get in a fight.
I was so prepared.
-To fight? -To run.
That was nothing.
They asked about what happened at Au’s house.
They must have understood.
Quite a big heart they have.
I thought they would beat you up.
No, it’s over.
Lupin.
Give me the money you extorted from kids.
Damn, Rhang!
You are desperate for two baht?
I want some music on.
How can you afford drugs
when you want two baht from me? Here.
I quit.
Quit buying?
Quit taking.
Fine then.
Are you sure you can find them?
Of course.
Trust me, I got red ballot today.
My hands need blood. Either IN or CHOL.
So, what’s next?
Stop talking, ride on.
Okay, got it.
Just tell me, just tell me one thing
Why you have changed?
About me Upset and crying because of you
It's just your imagination
Damn.
I'M IN FRONT OF DISTRICT OFFICE, DA
Da is here.
I’ll pick him up.
Let me come along, I miss him. Let’s go.
You stay here with Billy.
No. Where are you picking him up?
District office.
I won’t be long.
Okay.
Get me some drink.
Cheers.
I nearly got drafted, you know.
Luckily I didn’t.
There is a hot pot shop ahead.
Let’s go check it out. They might be there.
All right, let’s go.
Da.
-Damn. -I’ve missed you.
I could have attacked you back.
Are you all right?
Yeah, how about you?
You look the same, same long hair.
Have you waited for long?
Not at all.
And you, are you drunk?
I’m good. A little tipsy.
Who chose this song?
So spot on.
Sorry, Oh.
That son of a bitch, Billy, stabbed JR at the concert,
you stay out of this, alright?
Billy, you son of a bitch!
What?!
Scumbag!
-You scumbag! -Why did you slash me?
-Mod, please. -Oh!
Mod, stop. Please!
If CHOL means something to you…
Stay out of this!
Scumbag!
Hey!
This is my day.
Don’t you want to fight now?
INs and CHOLs?
Aren’t you so great?
Now that you got my little bee show.
Weren’t you so gritty before, huh?
Even Thai Life Insurance can’t help you.
And you, look at what you did to me.
You want more?
Huh?
And you,
you think you are a CHOL?
You are a CHOL?
Huh?
What?
I can’t hear you.
How is it running into my bullet?
Does it feel good? Does it?
Of the three of you,
who do I shoot first?
Do you wanna know who I shoot first?
Huh?
I'll tell you who I shoot first.
Who do I shoot first?
Shoot you?
Do I shoot you?
Or you?
I know.
I’ll shoot you all at the same time, scumbags!
Scumbag!
You dirtbag!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Don’t worry, Da.
I promise…
I’ll take a good care of your child.
After Da died,
I adopted Amm to be my daughter.
Amm lived with Da's mother from then.
How did Da’s mother die?
She was killed by drug addicts.
They have no relatives.
Billy took Amm in.
We all have to help with the expense.
Billy,
I’m sorry
that all of this happened.
Why are you apologizing?
It’s been a long time.
All because we were so wild.
I feel guilty because of that.
That’s why I became a teacher.
It’s just a moment in time.
I believe that everybody goes through rough times.
What matters is how you act upon them.
That’s why I am to blame.
Society despises me.
My daughter despises me.
What’s this?
Why are you drinking with my dad?
Did you force my teacher into this?
Dad.
If I knew what you had planned for the parents’ meeting,
I could have taken a motorbike taxi.
Inthira,
stop talking to your dad like that.
Do you realize what you have just said?
I do.
I always know what I’m about to say.
Do you have any idea why I am like this?
I’ll get some more ice.
How was the parents’ meeting?
I was so embarrassed
when my friend asked where my dad graduated from.
Damn.
He went to a technical college.
Who’d want to say that?
Yeah.
Is graduating from technical college that disgraceful?
I’ll call you back, Ter.
Do you have any idea what I have been through?
I know what you have been through.
Do you know the man you are drinking with
is not my real father?
Yes.
I was there when your dad died.
There is never a day that your dad and I in more pain…
than about that awful mistake we made.
I am sorry
that I am a part of that tragedy.
I’m so sorry.
Sorry?
You say sorry and does that make my life better?
Or will my dad come back to life?
My apology can't make your life better
or bring Da back to life,
but do you know that it’s Billy
who has been taking care of you?
Yes, I know.
I knew all along.
Let me fly with you.
I saw that he came to visit grandma all the time.
Hello, Mom.
When I was a kid,
he always gave my grandma money. It was for me.
Always brought along many things
and played with me,
made me smile.
He taught me to do my homework
and even did it for me.
He played guitar just to put me to sleep.
But I didn't sleep.
After my grandma died,
he took me in and raised me.
He took me to Aunty Peaw's restaurant.
He and Uncle Lupin took me to play games.
But what I never knew was,
I never knew if what he has been doing for me…
is because he feels responsible
or because he loves me?
You know, he never remembers anything about me.
He can’t even remember my birthday.
He doesn’t know what my favorite food is,
or what I enjoy doing.
He only knows when my real dad died.
When the school was established.
He drinks all day,
only cares about work,
wallowing in the past.
Dad, I really want to know.
Do you love me
or do you just feel responsible?
Amm.
I’m sorry.
DEDICATED TO EVERY SOUL THAT MY FRIENDS AND I WRONGED
I told you to stick to just one thing.
Now it’s all mixed up.
Think you are tough, huh?
Told you to take ketamine,
and you took two things.
Let it out.
The mall will be closed, no more buses.
I’ll have to find a way to get home.
You are such a burden.
How is it?
Get up, scumbag. Get up.
Anytime he is drunk, my shoulder hurts.
I wouldn’t complain if it was a girl.
He’s so heavy.
Put down the spartan sword.
or you’ll get to taste my Beretta.
I can shoot the three of you
like playing Tic-tac-toe, schmucks!
If I put it down, you’ll shoot us anyway.
Stop talking back to me.
You forked tongue.
I said put down your sword.
Quick!
Six rounds left, I definitely won’t miss.
Come on!
Now!
We're the BUs from Bang Na No one bats an eye
We're…
You have some grits, scumbags.
Go and find some Baihor bitter pills for your friend.
vegetable,
-or… mineral… -[roars]
…the monsters in the second season of The Witcher are here,
and they're all really hungry.
But each one has been around, stalking humanity,
longer than you might think.
Then the monsters aren't new. They're just new to here.
That's why I am back to explore our deepest, darkest tales
to uncover the real mythological origins
of the creatures in The Witcher season two.
So throw back some witcher juice and…
♪ Learn, watcher, learn… ♪
…about monsters.
We never actually get to see a wyvern in season two,
but it is the subject of a nostalgic conversation
between Geralt and Nivellen in the first episode.
[Nivellen] Horrid creatures.
And by the way, if you were wondering
why we're ignoring the giant magical man boar in the room,
it's because we already covered his kind in a previous bestiary.
But, you know, it's kind of telling that we're already distracted from the wyvern,
because they've spent centuries getting overshadowed
by the homecoming queen older sister of the flying lizard monster world -
dragons.
While dragon mania has run wild on six continents,
the wyvern is mostly relegated to Europe,
where it appears on heraldry and as soccer team mascots.
[sarcastically] Ooh, dragon, you're so scary and serious and universal!
Whatever. Wyverns are underrated.
Truthfully, the line between wyvern and dragon was blurry in medieval bestiaries.
was blurry in medieval bestiaries. Everything was.
The ancient viper, from which the wyvern got its name and many characteristics,
often looks like a dragon, and the wyvern carried that on.
Although sometimes, weirdly, it's pictured as kind of an irate capybara.
It's really only more recently that we see the two species become distinct..
The wyvern is typically smaller than the dragon,
with two legs instead of four, and may have a barbed, poisonous tail.
But I think what really kept bards singing about the wyvern were its quirks.
Eagle-eyed viewers may have noticed how one is often eating another.
That's them mating.
Sort of echoing a praying mantis,
a female wyvern would bite off a male's head
and thus become pregnant,
but they also, and this is a thing we read on a message board,
but a classics professor confirmed it,
fled in horror at the site of a naked man.
-It was great! -I feel like we've all felt that at some point or another,
although maybe not the one you're watching now.
Point is, don't let dragons hog the spotlight.
Maybe the poor, overlooked wyvern is a little more relatable.
Put them in season three, Netflix!
If there were a Venn diagram between vampires and witches -
and there should be - this part right here, that would be where the bruxsa live,
this part right here, that would be where the bruxsa live,
known as bruxa in the show.
There were similar fearsome creatures in the pre-Christian era,
but bruxsa really flourished in the rural areas of medieval Portugal,
right before authorities all over Europe
feverishly tried to accuse anyone remotely weird or interesting
of the dark practice of witchcraft.
Like witches, bruxsa were predominantly women
whose powers were said to come from oftentimes intimate pacts with the devil.
But unlike medieval witches,
who were sometimes depicted as having an obsession with the… male organ -
they even supposedly harvested penises from trees like this--
…the bruxsa possessed a vampire-like thirst for blood.
And to make it worse,
their favorite cocktail was the blood of an infant.
-Bruxsa had powers galore. -[screeching]
The evil eye, shapeshifting into birds,
ants, wolves.
But I didn't find evidence of a piercing scream like this
in bruxsa folklore,
so it's likely that a little bit of a banshee,
an Irish female spirit whose screams warn of impending death,
snuck into the Witcher version.
Luckily for the people of Portugal, though,
bruxsa did come with quirky vampire-like limitations and weak points.
Much like my own weak point is heroes moving purposefully in slow motion.
For whatever reason,
a bruxsa only possessed its powers between 12 and two in the morning,
which seems limiting.
Iron, garlic sewn into clothes,
or scissors left under the pillow of an infant could deter one.
And even if you couldn't stop a bruxsa, you could get revenge on it
by boiling and stabbing the clothes of a child it had killed.
But overall, a bruxsa is just one of those monsters.
If it lives near you, you should probably just move.
-[screeching] -Move quickly. Or at least don't go out from midnight to two.
I don't mess with trees, friend, and neither should you.
Because according to most folklore,
there's about an… oh, I don't know, 50-50 chance
you're going to piss off a forest spirit,
and you do not want that.
See, the world's mythologies are teeming with unpredictable woodland beings,
from the famous tragic Greek dryad
to the obscure, unsettling Japanese face-bearing tree
known as the Ninmenju.
Let's see that full screen.
Yep, okay.
Yep, I'm-- I'm unsettled. Yep.
But the creature we first see surprising the witchers in episode two
comes from the Slavic take on the archetype.
…telling me leshies are giant talking trees.
And since one-fifth of the world's forests are in Russia alone,
we should probably pay attention to its woodland monsters.
So a leshy usually isn't seen,
but when it is, it looks like an old man whistling in the forest,
with curiously missing features, a pointed head shape,
and, oh yeah, the green, mossy hair is kind of a giveaway.
But they're unpredictable by nature,
shapeshifters, able to assume giant and animal forms,
the latter usually a bear or a wolf.
They also just keep these critters around, like a leshy entourage.
Occasionally depicted as malevolent,
the leshy's attitude more often depends on humans' behavior
towards the wilderness they protect,
making them harder to predict.
And they are indeed known as tricksters who will lead travelers astray
or kidnap children, particularly unbaptized babies.
Trick!
They tend to be solitary,
but when they do get together, look out!
Leshy groups are infamous for wanton rape and pillaging.
And even getting rid of them isn't a sure thing.
Legend has it that acting a fool to make a leshy laugh
will get you out of trouble,
or you could try escaping their forests,
since outside, the leshy shrinks to the size of a mushroom.
But the best way is probably not messing with trees in the first place.
Because you never know when they'll mess back.
When we searched our ancient tomes and, well, Google,
for the witch Voleth Meir,
all we got was a bunch of casting news.
So I give up. Case closed.
Not a monster from any ancient mythology.
Except… Wait a spell. Something familiar… I can't help but…
Something familiar… I can't help but…
It's Baba Yaga! Voleth Meir is Baba Yaga!
Curse you, you showrunning enchantress, for nearly slipping one by on us.
Well, get ready, folks,
because I'm about to remove the hood from Voleth Meir.
Exhibit A. Baba Yaga is an old and prominent figure in Slavic folklore
described as either an ogress or a swamp witch.
Either way, powerful magic.
She looks as you might expect,
with a long and sensitive nose that comes into play in many stories,
but like Voleth Meir,
there's some ambiguity to Baba Yaga's character.
I'm simply a guide to get you exactly what you deserve.
She can certainly throw visitors into her oven,
but she often bestows gifts,
as in the tale of Vasilisa the Beautiful,
where the heroine is emancipated by Baba Yaga's magic skull
when it charbroils her cruel family.
But for exhibit B,
there's also some serious similarity in gadgets going on here.
There's no mistaking that Voleth Meir has
Baba Yaga's signature magical, chicken-legged cabin-style hut.
I mean, come on!
And by the way,
Baba Yaga's hut won't reveal its front door to just anyone,
exactly like Fringilla says…
A hut with no doors?
It's true that we never see anything like Baba Yaga's famous flying mortar and pestle,
anything like Baba Yaga's famous flying mortar and pestle,
but there is something about the way that Voleth Meir flies close to the ground
that mirrors it.
And finally, exhibit C,
there's the fact that Voleth Meir appears in three forms.
In some tales, Baba Yaga takes the form of a triad of sisters,
each, of course, named Baba Yaga.
But what's more is that she's sometimes served
by three riders in different colors.
You guessed it. Red, white, and black.
So, in closing, good people of the Internet,
I submit to you that Voleth Meir is at least inspired by Baba Yaga,
if not Baba Yaga herself.
What?
What the hell is this thing?
Well, The Witcher's writing team certainly is not making it easy this season.
Because the myriapod from episode three
isn't a single monster from mythology that I could find.
It's a potpourri of monster parts,
which we'll break into pieces to understand.
Oh my God, it's kind of like being a witcher!
This is so amazing!
Now, monster hybrids are not abnormal.
Anthropologists argue that these novel, imaginative configurations
helped them be remembered. It made them go viral in campfire tales.
But centipedes and their kin don't often get monsterized in European mythology.
The few I did find come from Asian and Indigenous folklore,
which, honestly, I feel kind of odd,
because our many-legged monster's namesake, Myriopoda,
is a biological family of sometimes lethally poisonous beasts
that just make you feel…
"icky" is the scientific term, I think.
Like, here's one swimming.
I don't wanna go swimming ever again now.
So now you know what the Vietnamese people around Ha Long felt
when seeing Con Rit,
a 60-foot armor-plated seafaring millipede
cruising the bay in the 1800s.
One even allegedly washed up on a beach.
It was documented by an oceanographer.
But it was thrown back because of its awful smell.
Maybe I could be, like, the Kaer Morhen bard-slash-medical examiner or something.
Am I getting ahead of myself?
Moving up top, our myriapod's head is a little more familiar
-in monsterdom, I… guess. -[screeching]
These are clearly the curved horns of a ram.
They can be an indicator of strength.
They're a feature of the criosphinx,
a powerful lion-ram hybrid that guards Egyptian temples.
But in Western mythology,
they can also be a symbol of wickedness.
The ultimate monster, the devil, sometimes has ram and goat horns.
It might explain why this creature immediately feels powerful and evil.
I feel like Vesemir would be really proud of the work I'm doing here.
There are many many-mouth monsters, like the hydra,
There are many many-mouth monsters, like the hydra, but they usually have distinct heads, so the myriapod is creepy.
but they usually have distinct heads, so the myriapod is creepy.
But in Aztec mythology, we find that Cipactli,
the crocodile demon upon which this world rests,
had mouths at every joint.
Hate to be his dentist!
-[growling] -Finally, the hand-chest thing.
Ah, these hands are…
Ugh, these hands are freaking me out, man!
Be cool, you're supposed to be a witcher!
If you're equally bothered, you can probably blame the Greeks
for introducing the world to Hecatoncheires,
three monstrous titans possessed of 100 hands and 50 heads each
and usually associated with natural disasters.
-[screeching] -So, power, wickedness,
disaster, and centipedes, all in one monster.
Maybe it's best to leave this to the more, um… seasoned witchers.
A long time ago, when the stars shined bright over the old world,
monsters lived in the lakes and rivers and ponds and streams,
where they played and ate and laughed and scared to their hearts' content.
But as humans moved to places where the most water you'd ever see was a stagnant puddle,
the water monsters became less relevant.
City-dwelling humans searched far and wide
for new stories about the murky, now shitty darkness beneath them,
the sewers.
So the disgusting, sewer-dwelling zeugl that we see in episode four
is wholly a creation of The Witcher's author,
Andrzej Sapkowski.
But sewer monsters on the whole are not rare.
Take the Bahkauv of Aachen, for instance.
This mutated calf lived in the sewers and hot springs of the ancient city
and primarily attacked drunken men
by leaping on their shoulders and demanding their money.
It's honestly sort of a letdown compared to a tentacle attack.
But lest you think this is some medieval city thing,
allow me to draw your attention to Victorian London,
where the Thames helpfully returned the contents of the sewers
to the citizenry with alarming regularity.
There, in a time when people foraged in the sewers -
that was a real thing -
legends swelled of the so-called Black Swine of Hampstead,
a pregnant sow who entered the sewers and gave birth to a family of pigs
that grew monstrous from inbreeding and feeding off the city's filth.
This was in the papers.
Even modern New York City has its own sewer monster myth,
the albino alligators
that now allegedly feed and breed in the darkness
after being abandoned in the '70s.
-But here's my thing with sewer monsters. -[gasps]
Do we really need a story to keep us out of the sewers?
You know, isn't the smell enough?
But know this.
You, you both…
smell truly awful.
I mean, it is like something has crawled up your arses
and died.
Yep, that's enough for me.
The Wild Hunt.
It just gives you a shiver, doesn't it?
Well, not to be the bearer of bad news after an already somber ending,
but we should probably call it "the Wild Hunts," plural,
because that shit was everywhere.
Yes, it turns out that throughout Europe, from Spain to Poland,
but even hopping over to the New World where hunters flew in a canoe,
people warned of ghostly lords and their often-demonic hunting parties
tearing through the countryside, usually during winter storms.
These were popular stories.
I saw them myself.
Just last week.
Riding their skeletal horses across the southern sky.
A portent of doom.
The hunt's leadership varied,
everyone from the Norse god Odin on down to local kings,
but there was often a curse at the start.
One overzealous lord in Germany, for instance,
had chased his quarry into a church and killed it there,
which was a no-no for the priest, who cursed him to hunt for eternity.
Everyone seems to agree that having the Wild Hunt in your area
meant a bad moon was a-risin',
but the specific punishments they doled out varied.
In more than a few tales,
the Hunt bizarrely tosses a severed leg or a shoe at witnesses.
So why were they everywhere?
Well, the Hunt was often used as a morality tale.
Either the leader or the victim clearly had spectral punishment coming to them.
But some say they also fulfilled the same function
as Halloween or Day of the Dead.
They blurred the boundary between life and afterlife.
So, undead or demonic,
led by gods,
bringer of bad luck and severed legs,
and basically everywhere.
Good luck next season, Geralt. [sighs]
Sometimes, monsters go extinct.
They pass from our stories, forgotten.
Chernobog is one of those near extinction.
Uh… Oh, wait, wait… Oh!
RIP, Chernobog. We hardly knew ye.
But some websites will confidently tell you
that Chernobog was the black god of darkness and misfortune,
locked in an eternal conflict
with the white god of goodness named Belobog.
Chernobog, they'll say, ruled over the bleak Slavic winter.
And I want to tell you all that's true,
because it sounds like a bitchin' origin for this guy,
but here's the problem.
When Christians brought writing to Slavic lands, they had an agenda.
Most of them weren't really into cataloging the idolatrous Slavic gods,
so not only do we not have much to go on,
what we do have is biased.
The most credible passage we have, from a monk named Helmold,
just speaks of a ceremony
in which Western Slavic villagers cursed the bad god, Chernobog,
and praised his unnamed opposite. That's it.
A much later passage spoke of chernobog being assuaged by human sacrifice.
And everything else?
Suspect, say scholars.
Kindly piss off!
So we may never really know much about the monster chernobog.
And, given what we've seen on the show, maybe that's okay,
because I will never forgive him for this.
We turned the briefest glimpse of a basilisk head
into a full segment last time because, well,
we didn't know there'd be giant basilisks
running around for five minutes in the final episode of this season.
Hindsight.
So let's review, shall we?
Although proportions vary by the tale,
the basilisk is typically portrayed as some mixture of reptile and chicken.
Born of a rooster's egg, yes, rooster,
that was incubated by a toad,
which, admittedly, sounds really silly,
the basilisk is considered a king.
"The little king of the serpents" in Greek.
But you can argue that its formidable arsenal of monstrous weapons
makes it way more dangerous than these beasts
makes it way more dangerous than these beasts and/or puny dinosaurs.
Like a dragon, it could breathe fire,
and its hiss could kill, so could its odor.
In fact, it was so very toxic that its venom was known
In fact, it was so very toxic that its venom was known to travel up a man's spear to kill him and the horse he rode on.
And scholars thought its native habitat of Libya
was actually a verdant paradise
until basilisk toxins turned it into the Sahara.
And we haven't even gotten to its famous death stare yet,
which even rivals Geralt's.
The basilisk's stare was thought to be instantly fatal.
Humans in antiquity went to great lengths to protect themselves from it.
For instance, in Warsaw in 1587,
the citizenry sent a convicted felon into a suspected basilisk lair
wearing a suit of mirrored armor
like he was on the basilisk bomb squad or something.
By the way, Warsaw now has this cool basilisk statue,
which we thought you might like to see.
Aside from Geralt, who kills them pretty easily without the aid of mirrors,
the basilisk did have one powerful enemy that the dinosaurs didn't have.
You may have seen it earlier.
It's the weasel.
Yes, despite all those instant-kill weapons,
a smelly weasel could somehow take out a basilisk.
And so one more chapter comes to an end in The Witcher's bestiary.
Happy hunting. Geralt of Trivia out.
There was one monster that was supposed to be in the season
but just missed the boat.
The gigantic kraken.
Lurking in the seas between Greenland and Norway,
it's most typically depicted as a monstrous cephalopod
that's so big it can make whirlpools, or look like an island,
But what if it does?
[photographers] Paul! Paul!
[reporter] A few words, Paul, Paul…
-[horn blares] -Wait! Hey, wait, that's my scarf! Stop!
Hi, beautiful.
Hi, you. You look great.
Oh, thanks, thanks.
-Paul! -Paul! Right over here.
-Two seconds. -Okay.
Hi, how you doing? Good to see you again. How are you? Thank you so much for coming.
-[woman] A few questions. -Hang on a second. Hang on.
I'd be nowhere without this amazing woman and brilliant writer in her own right,
my book editor, Madeline Kelly. -Maddie, come here. Come here. -Oh.
This is our night, Maddie. You and me, we did this together.
You wrote a great story, Paul. I just helped you polish it up.
Save me a moment inside, will you? I have something I want to talk about.
-What is it? -You'll see.
-Okay. -Okay.
-[reporter] Quick question. -Hi, Jay.
So, was there a particular lady in your life that inspired the love story?
Well, come on, you know, I can't give away all of my secrets.
-[laughs] -[cell phone rings] -[Paul] Always good to be back. -[Jay] Yeah? Another bestseller?
-[Paul] Always good to be back. -[Jay] Yeah? Another bestseller? Hello?
-[woman] Oh, Maddie. -[Maddie] Hi, Mom.
-Glad I caught you. -[clicking] [Maddie] What's that clicking noise?
I'm trying to order toilet paper online.
The students keep stealing it,
and the button on my keyboard keeps getting stuck.
Too much detail, Mom. Well, you asked.
It's a little hectic here.
I got stuck in traffic, and I just literally got to the venue.
You're gonna be late for your big night. It's bad time management.
I wish I could've been there to help you.
-Okay, Mom, can you hang on a second? -[Rosemary] Of course.
Yeah, just one second.
Okay, go ahead.
I was calling to see if you've had that talk with Paul.
Not yet. I hope you haven't told anyone about my feelings for him.
-[blows air] -Trust me. No one in Des Moines cares.
Well, Heather and Emma don't even know. You didn't tell them?
[Maddie] I'm just-- I'm not ready.
If your friends don't know,
it's entirely possible that Paul doesn't either.
No, I've given him plenty of signs.
You should see the way he looks at me when we work together.
-Mom, he gets me. -Well, you're in love with him.
-Why don't you just tell him? -I may not have to.
Oh. What's happened?
He says he has to talk to me about something.
-Really? -So tonight may be the night.
Ah! It works.
Okay, Mom, I have to go.
All right. If he doesn't tell you how he feels about you tonight,
you gotta speak up. That's all I'll say.
-Okay, love you. Bye. -[Rosemary] Love you too.
-Hey, girls! -[both] Hi!
This is so exciting.
We are so proud of you.
-Thank you for coming. -Oh, where's the scarf I gave you to wear?
-Somewhere in Brooklyn by now. -How'd that happen?
Freak accident. I totally get if you never wanna loan me anything again.
Don't worry about it, Mads. That scarf was a sample from work.
Heather, great job on the cover art.
You like it?
It's stunning. What do you think, Emma?
-I think you've been holding out on us. -On what? Paul?
Yeah, you've been working with him for over a year.
Don't tell me you haven't noticed.
I think he's an amazing writer. That's all.
You should have your name on the cover with him.
-You practically wrote the book. -No, I didn't.
I mean, not exactly.
Besides, it's good for my career. Paul's talking me up to the publisher.
-He's Irish. -Yes.
-Does he have a sexy accent? -Haven't noticed.
-Is he single? -Give me that.
-Okay. -Where are you going?
To find Paul.
Come on, Maddie. Don't wimp out now.
Here you are.
Thought I'd use a little liquid courage before going in to face the masses.
They're gonna love it. It's a beautiful story.
Well, I have you to thank for that.
If I had my way, the lovers would have tossed themselves into the lake by chapter ten.
You're amazing. You know that?
You balance me out, Madeline.
We do make a great team.
We do, which is why I wanted to talk to you
about something really important to me.
-You know you can tell me anything. -Well…
I feel like it's time
we take our relationship to the next level.
Oh, Paul, I don't know what to say. I feel exactly the same way.
[Paul] Really?
-That's wonderful. -[giggles]
So,
will you work with me on my next book?
I want to bring you in from the conception of the story.
I know you wanted to write your own novel. I can help you with that.
But do you think it could wait just… a little longer?
Oh, I, uh…
-Sure. -Great!
-Sounds great. -Wonderful!
-Yeah. -Well… [sucks teeth] Right, time to feed me to the wolves.
See you in there.
Well, if you stop moving, I can grab it.
[laughing] Just get me to the bathroom.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?
We're just having a minor eyelash malfunction.
May I offer my assistance?
Oh, uh, yeah. Maybe. They're the new NanoGrip lashes. I'm a stylist at Bergdorf's.
I get the latest samples of all their luxury cosmetics.
-This one gets a thumbs-down. -[laughs]
-Do you mind if I give it a go? -[Emma] Sure.
[Paul] I'll be very, very careful.
There.
How's that?
Much better.
Hate to break this up, but you have a lot of people waiting for you.
-Okay, well, after you. -Oh no, after you.
"She peers up from the watery depths."
"If only he would reach out for her,
it could break the spell."
"But instead, he turns his back." "She calls out with drowned words
as he disappears into the shadows of the mossy glen."
"Chapter eight."
"The first night she spent alone was the worst."
TWO IRISH HEARTS PAUL KENNEDY
There you go, Gertrude. That's a beautiful name, by the way.
Thank you, Paul.
-So, how did you three meet? -Oh, we're friends from school.
I was always a big reader.
What? [whispers] That was me.
-Would you like me to sign your book? -Oh, uh, yes, I would.
Of course.
-Here we go. -[Emma] Is that a real lake?
Yes. It's in Ireland. It's not far from my family's home.
Hmm, well, I'd love to see it sometime.
And I would love for you to see it sometime.
You write such amazing stories. I could listen to them all night.
-[both laugh] -Wow. Wouldn't that be great?
Unfortunately, Paul has press in the morning, so… Check, please.
-It's an open bar. -No, it's not.
It was amazing. [Heather] Yes.
This might have been the most incredible night of my life.
You and Paul seemed to hit it off.
I know, it's like we had this immediate connection.
Well, you can't take it too seriously. Paul's a famous person.
-He's used to making people feel special. -Well, he signed my book.
He signs a lot of books.
With his phone number?
It's just a phone number. It's not like it's a proposal.
I can't believe Paul and Emma are getting married.
It all happened so fast.
Like whiplash.
Welcome to Ireland. -Thank you. -Thank you.
Nearly there. You've got one more bag. Oh Paul, that one's mine too.
-There you go. -Did you bring enough luggage, Em?
I'm getting married.
You won't believe the number of wardrobe changes I'm gonna need.
Excuse me. Ma'am.
-[Heather] Mads. -Excuse me.
-[Heather]Are you okay? -Sure.
Maddie, have you got your bag?
Almost.
-We'll meet you out front, okay? -Okay.
If you need me on that job, I'm available at a moment's notice. Okay?
Good. All right. Yeah, of course. Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
-Oh. -Oh, sorry. This is mine.
[chuckling politely] Uh, no, I'm afraid it's mine.
-No, actually it's mine. -Hang on a minute.
There's an American woman trying to steal my bag.
I'm not. I'm trying to take my bag.
If you just look at the tag, you'll see.
I don't need to. I know my own bag. So let go.
I'm not letting go of my bag.
See? Look, my favorite plaid skirt.
Are you sure those are your size?
I'm so sorry.
It's quite all right. It could have happened to anyone.
Although I suspect it happens to you more often than most.
-Enjoy your visit. -Hmm.
LOST LUGGAGE
[Paul] Ah, Maddie. There you are.
We finally managed to get all of Emma's bags into the car.
I may have to ride on the roof.
-Can't believe this is actually happening. -I know. How are you feeling?
No cold feet, right? Me? Never.
I can't thank you enough for introducing me to Emma.
You've changed my life, and I'll never forget it.
[clerk] Can you please fill this out?
Looks like this is gonna take a while. -Why don't you guys head to the house? -No. I can't leave you here.
-Why don't you guys head to the house? -No. I can't leave you here.
-Don't worry about me. I'll take a taxi. -Okay.
Call me, let me know everything's okay. Good.
[sighs] "No Ubers in the area." Great.
Can you go to this address? Oh, yeah. I can take you there, love.
-Okay. -Yeah.
[man] Whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait!
Billy. Oh, good to see you again.
Couldn't convince anyone else to give you their bag?
As a matter of fact, my bag is missing, but they'll call me when they find it.
Well, if you're in need of boxer shorts, you know who to ask.
So, you're a photographer?
I am. A nature photographer.
Well, at least I'm trying to be.
It's a little trickier now the whole world carries a camera in their pocket.
Never thought about that.
-What brings you to Ireland? -A wedding.
-Oh, congratulations. -Oh, no. It's-- it's not mine. [chuckles] It's my friend's.
Maybe you'll be lucky to catch the bouquet.
[scoffs] What makes you think I wanna get married?
Nothing. It was a joke.
Apparently, a bad one.
TWO IRISH HEARTS
-Thanks. -All right. You enjoying that?
Yes. Have you read it? Nope. Don't need to.
-I barely made it through his last one. -[scoffs]
Paul Kennedy's one of the best-selling authors in the UK.
They sell a lot of fish and chips too. Doesn't mean they're any good.
[exhales] Well, he seems to be doing very well without your approval.
Not a friend of yours, is he?
[driver] Your stop coming up, Miss. Kennedy House.
As in Paul?
Well, that answers that question.
-[Maddie] Thank you. -No bother, love.
Oh, and, FYI, I edited this book. So, what do you have to say to that?
My deepest sympathies.
You know what? You can just go--
Hey, you. -You're trespassing, you know. -Uh, I'm sorry.
-You're trespassing, you know. -Uh, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm looking for Paul Kennedy.
I know who you are. Just having a bit of fun. I'm Kory, the brother.
-Hi. -Come on, everyone's inside.
Oh, Maddie! You made it!
Yeah, I took the bus, which was fine,
except for the cheeky English guy I had to ride with.
-Olivia, this china is divine. -[man chuckles]
You have an excellent eye. It's Belleek. -Oh. -It's been in the family for generations.
Just this way. [chuckles]
Oh wow. This place looks like a fairy tale.
Except around here, if you lose your shoe at midnight,
you're just drunk.
[whispering] He's so cute.
-[Emma] Wow, really? -I've got Maddie here. Fresh off the bus.
-Hey, Maddie. -[man] Good.
-Sean. Paul's dad. -Hi.
-Oh, no! -[tense music builds]
Um, I'm so sorry. [chuckling] Quite all right. -No damage done. -Yes, sir.
Have they found your luggage?
-No, not yet. -[man] Come join us.
Oh, Mads, I'm sorry.
[Maddie] It's okay.
It was insured.
It's not the bag we're worried about. It's the bridesmaid's dress.
Without it, you'll imbalance the look of the wedding party.
Maybe she could stand-off to one side. You know, like a cheering section.
Right! The car is loaded up.
Madeline. Everybody about ready to go?
-[Heather] Oh yeah. -Where are we going?
Paul's planned a surprise trip for us all. Isn't he sweet?
-Just give me a sec to get changed. -Mm-hmm. Such a lovely young woman.
She's adorable.
Madeline, you must be so thrilled for them both.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
SCRUFFY MURPHY'S PUB & INN
[man] You all right? Good.
Afternoon. How are we, chaps?
That looks good.
[laughs] There's the world traveler. Good to see you, Murphy.
Doing well? How's it going?
Oh, fine, fine. So, are you around for a week this time?
I am. Yeah, I'm covering the sheep-shearing festival.
Oh, there's great excitement around here for that one.
[chuckles] I'm sure.
Now Fionnuala is getting your room ready,
and you can use my old Triumph while you're here.
No, no, no, no. I can't take your car.
Look, you can trade me with one of your fancy photographs.
And I'll hang it up in the pub. -All right, deal. -[Murphy laughs]
You're still liking it?
All this gallivanting around the world?
Snapping pictures of lizards and birds, huh?
I am. [Murphy] If you don't stay put,
how are you going to find a nice woman to settle down with you?
I'm not sure I'm cut out for settling down with anyone.
What am I telling you for? You've never listened to me anyway.
-Good to see you, man. -All right.
Beautiful.
Hey! You need anything? I can lend you some clothes.
-No, I'm good. I had a sweater in my bag. -Okay.
-Gorgeous view. -Yep.
Is everything okay with you? You seem a little off.
Yeah. No, uh, I'm good. I'm great.
Why don't we have a girls' night? We can go out, get a couple drinks, meet some guys.
You haven't dated in almost a year since you started writing that book.
-Just say yes. Come on, come on! -Yes.
Thank you. I'll see you downstairs in 15.
-Happy couple taking us on a picnic. -Ugh.
Thank you.
-I'll take the basket. -Lovely. I'll take the heavy thing. Right, follow me. Let's have a picnic.
Right, follow me. Let's have a picnic. [Maddie] It's so pretty here.
[Paul] This bridge was used by the Vikings.
[Emma] This must be where you get all your creative inspiration.
-[Paul laughs] -Look, it's Lough Tay. -It's the lake from Paul's book. -Ah.
[Heather] Oh, it's beautiful.
Is this where your mystical fairy lives, in a sunken city at the bottom of the lake?
-Yeah, exactly. You're so perceptive. -Except she's not mystical.
She's wicked and selfish, and she lures men to their watery deaths.
-Maddie! -No, that's right. -Evil fairy. -[all laugh]
[Paul] Anyone fancy a boat trip? -[Heather] Oh! -[Kory] I do.
-[Paul] Nevin put some boats aside for us. -[all laugh]
-Maddie, come on, we can squeeze you in. -Oh, it's okay.
There's plenty of room. It'll be fun.
-I'm just gonna go for a walk. -Really? Okay.
-Are you sure? -Yeah.
-Could we get a picture? -Oh, okay.
-[all] Cheese! -[Maddie] Woo-hoo!
How about one of Paul and I?
Here, use my phone. That way, I can post on my stories later.
Okay. Uh, one, two, three.
-[Kory] Think the water's warm? -Here you go. Thank you, Mads.
-I am so excited by this. All right, have fun.
-[Kory] See you later. -Enjoy your walk.
-[Heather] And we're off. -[Emma] Oh, it's lovely.
[Heather] I'm counting on you. Bye, guys.
-See you, Maddie! -Bye!
-Hi, Mom. -You promised you'd call when you landed.
Sorry. I am safe and sound.
Actually, Paul took us to Lough Tay. It's really magical in person.
Is there something in your voice? Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay, but… I can't help but think that things would be different
if I'd just taken your advice and told Paul how I felt.
[Rosemary] Sweetheart, think of this as a lesson learned.
You're gonna have to start speaking up for yourself.
Stop that.
[Maddie] Yeah, well, it's too late now.
It's not like I can tell Paul I wish he was marrying me instead of Emma.
-[static] -Maddie? -Mom? -Maddie? Maddie?
-Mom? -Maddie? Maddie?
Mom, it's…it's reconnecting.
Mom?
Was that a wish you were making? Oh, no, I was just, um…
I mean, I guess, but I didn't think anyone was listening.
Well, I was. Look down.
Okay.
They call that a wishing chair, but you have to do it right.
So, sit down, close your eyes and make your wish.
Oh, no, I'm good.
What are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid. I just-- I don't believe in that kind of thing.
Well, then you have nothing to lose. Oh, come on. Why not give it a go?
Okay, I wish--
No, you have to do it right. Sit down.
Close your eyes and mean it.
[sighs] Okay, I wish…
I wish I was marrying Paul Kennedy.
[chuckling] Well, that didn't work.
Didn't it? And how can you tell?
Isn't there supposed to be an earthquake or a lightning bolt or something?
So you want something more theatrical?
Let me see if I can muster up a stiff breeze. Would that help?
That would be nice.
-[shower running] -That was a weird dream.
Hello?
Hello?
Heather? Emma?
Are you in there?
[gasps] Paul!
Ah, Maddie, you're up. Can you hand me a towel?
Uh, sure. Yeah. Okay. Um…
Um, Paul, what are you doing in here? Taking a shower. What does it look like? Have you seen my beard balm?
Taking a shower. What does it look like? Have you seen my beard balm? No!
What's wrong with you?
[Maddie] Nothing, I just, um-- I didn't know you were in here.
-Where else would I be? -Right. Okay.
Oh! Uh, I'm-I'm gonna go. Right. So sorry.
Whoa! Oh!
Maddie! Are you all right?
-They found my suitcase. -[Paul] Come here.
You know what? I'm gonna go outside. I'll just-- Yeah, I'm gonna get some air.
-Oh, morning, Mads. -Hi, Emma.
Emma! You're up early.
I'll get a run in before breakfast. Have you seen Paul?
-Paul? -I've been looking for him everywhere.
You know, you can get lost in this house.
Yeah, well, uh, he is definitely not in there. At all.
-Right. [chuckle] -You know what?
As a matter of fact, I haven't seen an inch of him anywhere.
-What? How did he get in there? -[Emma laughs]
-Morning, Emma. -[Emma] Morning.
-Your mother's looking for you downstairs. -Oh. Great, thanks.
-I'll see you at breakfast? -Whoa. Paul.
What? It's not like she's never seen us kiss before.
Nevin, my jacket.
So, uh, getting ready for the big day, huh? You must be getting excited.
I'm looking forward to the reception.
There are some seriously hot men in this town.
See?
-Oh. Hey, are you-- -I need to talk to you.
What in the world, Mads? What is wrong?
I'm gonna tell you something, but you cannot breathe a word of this to Emma.
Oh. All right.
Last night, I had the craziest dream.
We were by the lake, and this odd lady told me to make a wish.
And I wished that I was marrying Paul Kennedy.
-I know that probably shocks you. -Should it?
Well, anyway, when I woke up from the dream, my suitcase magically appeared,
when I woke up from the dream, my suitcase magically appeared,
and Paul was taking a shower. In there!
[chuckling] Okay.
Isn't that a bit weird to you?
And there's a wedding dress in my suitcase! Uh, yeah.
-Why is it in there? -Because it's yours, silly.
You and your mom picked it out in New York. What?
Yeah, and in a couple of days,
you're gonna put it on, walk down the aisle, and get married!
No, I'm not! Yes, you are.
I think you're having a little pre-wedding anxiety. -Perfectly normal. -I mean, what are these?
-Perfectly normal. -I mean, what are these? These aren't mine. Girl, sexy heels for your honeymoon.
No. I am not the one who's getting married. She is!
[Heather] Exactly.
You, my friend, are marrying Paul Kennedy.
Now, just breathe. Relax. This is gonna be the best weekend of your life.
Get dressed.
I'm marrying Paul Kennedy.
Yes!
I'm marrying Paul Kennedy!
Whoo! Yes!
-Okay, so-- -Well, I just don't understand it.
Why can I not find a photographer for this wedding?
-Because you're horrible, Mum. -[Paul laughs]
The last two photographers you hired for our parties left in tears.
-Did they really? -Yes.
They did. They were crying and everything.
Oh, there she is.
-Good morning, everyone. -[all] Good morning.
Uh, darling?
Allow me.
Thank you.
-Are you feeling all right, Madeline? -Yes. Just a little jet-lagged.
Have some champagne. It's working for me.
Thank you.
Try these local woodland strawberries. They're delicious. Let me give you one. Very good.
Madeline, would you like a boxty? A what? [chuckles nervously]
Oh, she's so adorable. Um, it's an Irish pancake.
Oh, okay, thank you. Sean, I meant to tell you. The bakery called.
The wedding cake we ordered is too tall for the delivery truck.
-Oh, no. -Could you get a smaller cake?
[Kory] Very good.
-I like your thinking. -[Olivia] Well done, dear.
[Sean] Finally, someone with some sense.
Well, the weather seems to be holding up. You fancy a bike ride this morning?
-Oh, with me? -Mm-hmm.
-Of course with me. -[both laugh]
Emma and I are going down to the orchard to pick some apples.
-Kory, do you want to come with us? -I can't. I've got rugby practice.
Paul, can we go pick apples? I'm not really that coordinated on a bicycle.
Don't be silly. Everyone knows how to ride a bike.
Sweetheart, can you pick up the pace a little? Paul, I'm trying.
[Heather] These are so luscious.
-[Paul] Maddie, you still back there? -I'm coming.
-Oh, hey. -Hi, ladies.
Hey, Maddie.
Whoa! Whoa!
-Maddie, are you okay? -Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.
-You all right? -Yeah, I'm okay. I'll just hop back on.
I don't know, you kind of look like a liability on that thing.
Oh, no, I'll just push it and trot along next to you.
Well, I was kind of hoping to get some cardio in, babe.
-It's okay. I'll take it from you, Maddie. -No.
Could use a bike ride. I'm low on my steps. -All right then! -Alright. -Quick little trip around the village? -Only if you can keep up with me.
-Quick little trip around the village? -Only if you can keep up with me.
-Whoo! -[Paul] Them fighting words.
[Emma] Yeah, left you in my dust!
[Paul] I'm gonna get you.
-So, want to pick some apples? -[sighs] -Yeah, sure. -Okay.
[Heather] I literally cannot believe we got so many apples.
How about we make an apple pie for Kory? Maybe he likes a girl that can bake.
There you are. I've been looking for you everywhere.
Madeline, do you realize what time it is?
We have an appointment at the tailor's for the fitting of your wedding dress.
Oh, but don't I already have a dress? My mom and I picked it out together.
Oh, speaking of your mother.
Nevin will collect her from the airport and bring her to the rehearsal.
-My mother's coming? -Better late than never.
[Emma] Yeah, I agree with you.
I don't see a problem with guys using Botox.
Right? I mean, I don't need it now, but maybe in the future.
Oh hey, Em.
-[Emma] Hey. -Hi.
Paul, darling, I thought you told Madeline about the wedding dress.
I did.
-Right, honey? -No.
Well, anyway, come on.
-Well, she's no fun. -My mom can handle her.
[Olivia] It fits her like a dream.
[Liam] Spectacular.
Magnificent.
-Wow. -Wow.
My grandmother wore that gown on her wedding day.
So did my mother. So did I.
It's a tradition in our family, Madeline.
It's really… fun.
"Fun"?
It's vintage Lanvin.
It is a fashion artifact. It is the sphinx of wedding gowns.
Maybe you could add a slit?
[James] Brilliant. They have it.
THE NEW BESTSELLER FROM PAUL KENNEDY
-Hello. -Hello.
-Let me get you this. -Thank you.
-[computer chimes] -Oh! Congratulations. You are our 100th customer of the week.
Oh. Wow. Which means you win

-That's okay. It's fine, thanks. -But it's free.
-[chuckles] -Even so.
There you go.
-Little gift. -Of course.
-One of this. -Lovely.
Oh, and the payment. There you go.
-[cell phone chimes] -Perfect.

SHEEP SHEARING FESTIVAL
CANCELLED
-After you. -Thank you.
WEST COAST RARE BOOKS
Oh, come on. You've got to be joking.
Oh, come on. You've got to be joking. I was looking forward to that gig.
-It's really not that bad. -Yes, it is. What are you talking about?
-What are you gonna do about this, Maddie? -Well, I'm just gonna wear the dress.
Because it's only a dress and because Paul wants me to.
[woman] And because you wished it. Did you just hear that?
[gasps] There she is. That's her! She's right there. There she is!
Who? Maddie!
Hey, wait, come back!
What does that mean? I'm happy with my wish.
[woman] Are you really happy with your wish?
[Maddie] Where are you going?
I love my wish. Come back! Please don't take it away!
Hello.
-It's you. -You all right?
-You didn't see me crossing the street? -Well, yes, but you ran into me, so…
-Well… -There you go.
It's okay. I got it.
-Here. -Oh. Well done.
Hey. You told me you didn't like Paul's books.
-Sorry, what? -When we were on the bus.
[laughs] I don't mean to be rude, but do I know you?
You don't remember?
-Oh, that's because it didn't happen. -[James] What didn't happen?
-Nothing. -[Emma] Maddie!
-What was that about? You just ran off. -I, um, I saw--
You found one. A photographer. Wonderful. Well done, Madeline.
No, I…
Olivia Kennedy. And you are?
James. James Thomas. Lovely to meet you.
I don't suppose you're any relation to Paul Kennedy, the author?
That's my son.
-Ah. -[Olivia] This is his bride-to-be. -Of course you already knew that. -I didn't, actually.
-Of course you already knew that. -I didn't, actually.
The thing is, James is not that kind of photographer.
How do you know that?
-You're a photographer? -[James] I am.
What would you charge?
I appreciate the offer, but I don't think I'm the man for the job.
What do you mean? I don't really photograph people.
Whatever your fee is, I will triple it.
When did you say the wedding was?
You see how there's this beautiful glow around the bride and groom.
-It's lovely. -That's what I'm looking for.
Something ethereal.
And then any photographs of me should be taken from the right.
That is my better side.
All right.
Whose car is in the middle of the drive?
Hey.
Oh, good, darling. You're just in time.
Madeline found a wedding photographer for us. Oh!
James Thomas, this is Paul, my fiancé.
-I've read some of your work. -[Paul] Oh.
-It's always nice to meet a fan. -Yes, I'm sure it is.
You know, my publicist said
that we should get some PR pictures after the wedding
of Madeline and I in some idyllic Irish backdrops.
He thinks it'll help boost my sales figures.
So not just a wedding but a good PR event too.
Yeah, exactly.
[Olivia] Especially since Maddie is Paul's book editor.
Why don't the three of you spend tomorrow driving around the area?
-You might find some great spots. -That sounds wonderful.
-What do you think, Paul? -It's a great idea. -10:00 a.m., James? -Sure.
-10:00 a.m., James? -Sure.
Madeline, would you mind showing James out? Sure.
So you're not just his fiancée but his editor too. How convenient.
If you're gonna spend the day with us, can you leave your snark at home?
Since I don't technically have a home, I don't know where that would be.
I'll do my best.
I suppose I should be thanking you for the job.
I don't mind saying it's gonna come in very handy. Now that the world has a camera in their pocket?
It's what I always say. Really?
Yeah.
-See you in the morning. -Yep.
Guess what? You are marrying Paul Kennedy.
Oh! Yes!
-What the-- -[thud]
-Paul? -Maddie! What the hell?
I'm sorry! I was asleep! God, that hurts.
I didn't… It was a knee-jerk reaction. Did I get you in the eye?
You got a bit more than the eye.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you hurt? Don't-- Don't touch me.
-Okay. -Okay?
-Yeah. -Oh.
I'm so sorry.
Are you sure you're okay?
-[Paul] Oh, I'm tickety-boo. -[Maddie]. Okay.
-You're doing a grand job, mate. -[man] Thank you.
Ah. Morning.
Where's Paul? Uh, he's not coming.
Well, why not?
He had a little late-night injury.
He said we should scout locations.
-Nothing serious, I hope? -Oh, no, he just needs the ice.
-What about your friends? -Uh, they're getting mani-pedis.
Ready?
So how did you become an editor?
Oh, well, I was a freelance writer, but that wasn't really paying the bills.
-Then I got a job at the publishing house. -Ah, so that's how you met Paul.
Yeah. He wasn't really clicking with any of the other editors,
and we were a good fit right off the bat.
That's interesting.
What does that mean?
I guess opposites attract.
Excuse me, Paul and I are not opposites. We have many things in common.
I stand corrected. I'm sure it's a long list of mutualities.
Why don't we stay silent for a second? That way I can enjoy the view.
As you wish.
-[Maddie] How about you? -[James] We don't need to talk about me.
-Nice view though. -[Maddie] Where are we going?
-This is so pretty. -Oh, it gets better. Come on.
So… I've got to ask.
Do you have to?
-[chuckling] Go ahead. -Okay.
Why don't you write your own book?
I've been trying, but it's been a bit difficult lately.
Because you're too busy working on Paul's book.
No, I just…
-I'm not sure I have anything to say now. -Everyone has something to say.
They just have to be brave enough to say it.
-Are you calling me a coward? -Absolutely not.
-You came up with that all by yourself. -Okay. [laughs]
[James] Right. Well, Paul said he wanted some authentic Ireland.
So, this is about as authentic as it gets.
[Maddie] Wow.
It's the Cliffs of Moher.
-You know it? -I've heard about it.
-What do you think? -[camera clicks]
I think I just stepped into a James Joyce novel.
That's not the reference I was expecting. Joyce is my favorite author.
Is he?
Hey, you're pretty good. [chuckles]
Thank you.
Unfortunately, I don't think a rugged cliff is Paul's style.
No. No, probably not. But is it yours?
-Yeah, I think it's beautiful here. -Yeah, me too.
[sighs] I'd love to get married up here.
Why don't you?
Because the wedding is this weekend, and I don't want to be difficult.
I'd hardly call having a voice at your own wedding being difficult.
Sorry, I just like to know a little bit about my subjects before I photograph them, that's all.
I thought you didn't photograph people.
I'm willing to make an exception.
-Wow. -[Finn] That was awful.
This looks like fun. Heather, Emma. Come meet my mate, Finn.
Hi, I'm also Paul's groomsman. Nice to meet you.
Paul, what happened to you?
Well, it's a long story.
I'm trying to minimize the damage. -Look. -[gasps]
Do you think it'll show in the photos? I have an amazing concealer you can borrow.
That'd be great. Thanks.
[Finn] Heather, I was talking to Kory about the big wedding aisle walk.
Should we all practice, so we can make a splashy entrance?
I've got my eye on you, Finn.
-He's trying to steal my spotlight. -I got moves, Paul. I ain't gonna lie.
Oh, no one could steal your spotlight. Can I get you some more ice?
No, no, no. Stay here and entertain me. Stop me feeling sorry for myself.
Are you always so thoughtful?
Not with everybody. Lucky me.
[James] There's a storm's coming. We should probably get you back. I'm sure you got lots to do.
Not really. Paul's mom has already done everything.
Where's your mum in this whole equation?
In Des Moines, but she's flying in for the rehearsal dinner tomorrow.
-I'm sure you'll be happy to see her. -It'll be great to get her here.
-I'm sure you'll be happy to see her. -It'll be great to get her here. She knows how to handle these situations. It'll make everything easier.
She knows how to handle these situations. It'll make everything easier.
-Should-- -Give me a hand with that. Yeah.
Just pull.
Holy mother of God!
-This is intense. -You know what they say about Ireland?
If you don't like the weather, just wait five minutes.
Mark Twain said that.
That is a really big tree. [James] Yeah, it is.
And this is the only road out.
-There has to be another way around it. -If we had a Hummer.
I'll have to turn around. It's okay. I know a lovely little pub we can go to.
Wait, really?
-[James] Come on. Come on. -[Maddie] Ah!
-[James] Get under. -Thank you.
Let's go.
It's a good pub, this. It'll be worth it.
Wow. This is a fun place.
They do the best fish and chips in Ireland here.
-I thought you didn't like fish and chips. -What makes you think that?
Well, you said…
Never mind.
James Thomas, you bastard.
O'Callaghan, you swine.
-[laughs] -How are you, buddy? Yeah. What brings you here?
Well, there's a tree down on the road, so we're stuck.
Oh, right, I heard, yeah. Seamus is gonna see to it first thing in the morning.
-But he's a little cabbaged now. -[both chuckle]
In that case, we'll need two rooms for the night.
Whoa, wait, we can't spend the night here. Well, do you fancy sleeping in the car?
Just give me a second.
[Paul's voice] This is Paul Kennedy. I can't get to the phone right now.
-Who's that lovely creature? -Calm down.
Don't tell me you finally convinced some young lady you're worth a shake.
Hey, Paul, it's Maddie.
Uh, a tree fell down in the middle of the road, and so we are stuck here.
Her name is Madeline Kelly, and I'm photographing her wedding.
-Her wedding, huh? -Now, now.
Looks like I'll have to spend the night. Call me when you get this.
Okay, I left a message. Good. Let's eat.
-Ah, take a seat. -Okay.
How about a couple of stouts?
Oh, can I have a white wine, please? I don't really drink beer.
Ooh, I wouldn't say that too loud around these parts. -You'd get locked up for treason. -[all laugh]
-He seems great. -Yeah, he's great.
Tom and I go a long way back.
I've been coming to Ireland since I was a kid, so it holds a very…
special place in my heart.
Is it true that you don't have a home?
This week it's a rented room above Scruffy Murphy's.
After, I'll be on the road traveling the world
with nothing but a camera and a passport. ♪ Different situations ♪
Doesn't that get lonely after a while?
I mean, it's…
There's a freedom, having no ties.
Well, maybe you haven't found that person to spend the rest of your life with.
Like you did?
Do you play darts?
Not recently. Let's play now.
Here we go.
It's all about grip, stance, and confidence.
-You don't like to talk about yourself. -What makes you say that?
You keep changing the subject.
You're supposed to keep your feet on the floor.
You see what I mean?
This time, just try your stance like this.
Only your arm moves.
You're a man of mystery.
If you keep talking, you won't visualize hitting the target.
-That was sneaky. -I'm not sneaky.
Maybe it's the luck of the Irish then. Or maybe it's just you.
-I mean, you're a good coach. -Well, you're a good student.
I'm getting married in two days.
Right.
-Your drinks. -Oh.
And your rooms.
-Lovely. Thanks, Tom. -Enjoy.
Thank you.
-You want to try it? -Uh, sure.
Not bad.
-One dance before we call it a night. -[laughs] Okay.
I'm sorry. I need to get by here.
It's a family emergency. I got to go. Please. Please.
Yeah, you're done. You're done.
Thank you. Bye.
Hi, I've been standing in line all this time at the wrong counter, and I've missed my flight.
So I need you to get me another one immediately.
Principal Kelly. It's me, Allegra.
-Oh. Yes, hello, Allegra. -Hi.
Well, I need to get to Ireland. My daughter's getting married.
-Maddie's getting married? -Yes. I'm pressed for time.
I missed my flight to Dublin. So see if you can you find me another one.
Then I need a connection to Knock airport. That's in West Ireland.
Sure. How did you miss your plane?
A clock malfunction.
You overslept. That's crazy.
There was a power outage, and my backup phone alarm just…
-What are you doing? -I'm texting Kimmy.
Remember her from detention? She's gonna freak out.
-Seriously? -Yeah.
-[laughs] -Somebody help me. Please, help me!
Let's go.
WILD HEN INN
-[engine chugging] -Come on, please start. Please. [Tom] Mm-hmm. Nope, nothing.
I can't believe this. I'm gonna be late for my own wedding rehearsal.
Could be water in the carburetor.
-We could try a rolling jump. -What's that?
You two push. I spring the clutch.
-Sure. Okay. -Yeah, great.
All right, ready?
-[James] Mm-hmm. -Okay!
Push!
Success!
Ah, crap.
I'll get a rag.
-[exhales] -That'll do. A rag.
[Olivia] Well, no sign of Madeline.
First, her mother misses the flight, and now here we are waiting for the daughter.
-I hope this isn't a family trait. -You couldn't make it up.
[Heather] I'm sure Maddie will be here any minute. I mean, those trees can be a huge challenge,
and we don't even know if they had a chain saw, right, Em?
and we don't even know if they had a chain saw, right, Em? Yeah, right.
I can't believe you didn't bring a phone charger. -Neither did you. -[sighs]
Does this car go any faster?
-No. -Great.
-It's not funny. -It's pretty funny. It'll be fine. Look.
Look at that.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today
to celebrate the love of these two fine, young people who--
Hold on, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.
Close call, Maddie. You almost lost your place.
Come here. Come here.
Oh. Sorry.
-What happened to you? -[Maddie] Well…
Uh, I'm afraid I'm to blame.
We were coming back from the Cliffs of Moher. What were you doing in that tourist trap?
How did you get all muddy?
Well, we're all together now, and that's what matters.
Mind if we cut to the chase?
We have guests are arriving at the rehearsal dinner in an hour.
All right then, let's skip to the good part.
You may now kiss the bride.
[Maddie] James?
What?
Who's James?
That'd be me.
What happened?
Well, you fainted.
It's her.
It's who?
Saint Brigid?
She's the one who made all this happen.
-Do you think she's been at the whiskey? -Sean, please.
-Must be the stress of the wedding. -Need water?
No, I'm just, uh… I just feel a little dizzy, that's all.
-Are you sure you're okay? -Yeah, of course I'm okay.
I'm marrying Paul Kennedy. That's right.
Shall we continue?
Of course, Father. Sorry. [priest] Where were we?
-[clinks] -[Olivia] Quieten down, everyone. My darling husband, Sean, has the floor.
Thank you, darling.
May your hearts be light and happy.
May your smiles be big and wide.
And may your pockets always have a coin or two inside.
No worries there, Maddie. You're marrying a Kennedy.
-Sláinte! -[all] Sláinte!
-You're drinking Guinness now, Maddie? -I'm acquiring a taste for it.
All right, now in honor of the happy couple,
we're gonna play a game of "How Well Do You Know Your Fiancé?" -[all] Oh! -[laughs]
Three questions. If you get them right, you both take a shot.
Mm-hmm. [Kory] If you get them wrong, we all have to drink a shot.
We have to drink no matter what? Can we play a different game?
Oh, no, you're not getting out of this. Kory's making the rules.
All right, first question. Who is Maddie's favorite author?
[Emma] Oh, that's an easy one.
Paul Kennedy.
No. Very good. Very good, no.
No, my fiancée likes the classics. Her favorite author is…
[whispering] James Joyce.
…Charles Dickens.
[sighs] That's right.
One point for the happy couple.
Question two. What is the song you first danced to together?
-Well, there wasn't one. -Mm!
-Maddie doesn't know how to dance, do you? -[all laugh]
Nope. [chuckles]
We've heard enough from you, brother. Last question is for you, Maddie.
Where did Paul propose to you?
-[Olivia] She knows that answer. -[Kory] Tell us anyway.
-Propose? -[Finn] Yeah.
You know, how'd you get the ring on your finger?
Well, go on, Maddie. Tell them.
Well, it was in this really special place.
Really special. It was so, so special and…
Right, wasn't it? It was really beautiful and special.
It was at O'Toole's in Brooklyn on my birthday.
Exactly.
-It was. It was at O'Toole's in Brooklyn. -Mm-hmm.
-On your birthday. -On my birthday.
And then…
Well, and then Maddie looked at me,
and she said, "What would it take for you to bring me to Ireland?"
And I said,
-"We'd have to be getting married." -[laughter]
And then…
Then…
Oh, she's only messing.
Then you got down on your knee, and you proposed to me.
I proposed?
I mean, yes, of course. Yes, I proposed. Me.
-I. Yes, I proposed. -You. [laughs]
And the rest, as they say, is history.
-You all right? What's the matter? -Foot's hurting.
Come on.
Excuse me.
James, I thought I might take a look at those.
I think it might be better if you stay tonight.
I've asked Nevin to make up the tower suite for you.
Nevin. Lovely.
-I'll see you in the morning. -Fantastic.
-Thank you for today. -Of course. Thank you for having me.
Are you leaving already?
No, no, no. Just packing up my stuff for the night.
Olivia has me staying in their guest tower. Sounds very posh.
I don't think she trusts me to make it on time tomorrow after the tree incident.
Thank you for taking me to see the Cliffs, and for the dance.
I'd like to think of myself as a full-service photographer.
Is it everything you imagined?
-What? -This.
All of this.
You seemed confused in there, like you and Paul didn't know each other.
That's ridiculous. Of course we know each other.
-Charles Dickens? -Anybody can make a mistake.
Yeah.
I hope you're not making one too.
You don't get to say that to me.
We barely know each other. We spent a day together.
I admit it was a beautiful day
filled with dramatic vistas and romantic rain,
but that doesn't give you the right to question my life choices.
Tomorrow, I'm marrying Paul Kennedy.
Because you asked him.
Wait, so… so what? You don't think a woman can ask a man to marry her?
Of course not. But if you were my girlfriend, I wouldn't have waited.
I'd have asked you first.
You know what? Maybe you shouldn't come to the wedding.
I'll tell Olivia then.
-Fine. Take the photos. -Fine. It'll be the last you see of me.
After this job, I'm off to Bolivia to photograph an endangered tree lizard.
-What? When do you leave? -Sunday.
Great. Right on time to keep running from your own life.
I shouldn't have said that.
A bit late.
Mom?
-I got a flight. We're about to board. -[Maddie] You did?
-That is great news. -I'll be there in time for the wedding.
But don't pick me up. I'll take a taxi.
Okay. Mom, I'm so happy you're coming. -I really need to see you. -[Rosemary] I'll be there soon.
-I really need to see you. -[Rosemary] I'll be there soon.
I'll make sure your wedding to Paul is absolutely perfect.
[Maddie] Thank you, Mom.
[announcer] Gate change announcement. Flight 47 to Dublin will now…
What did they just say? Hold on one sec, honey.
Where's everyone going? What's happening?
-I gotta go. Bye. -Mom? Mom?
Coming through. Coming through.
Phew! Hi.
Hi. Uh, looks like you're having fun. Emma's a good dancer, huh?
Yeah. Hey, maybe she can give you a few pointers for tomorrow.
Oh, I almost forgot. I wrote our vows. I emailed them to you.
Wait, uh, you wrote my wedding vows?
Maddie, I am a writer.
But maybe you can spruce them up a bit, huh?
Paul, can you come here for a sec?
Oh. I'm being summoned. You coming? You know, I think I'm gonna head to bed if that's okay. I'm pretty beat.
Okay, well, I'm staying in the guest room tonight. Wouldn't want any bad luck before the wedding.
-No. Wouldn't want that. -[both laugh]
-Good night. -Good night.

UNTITLED NOVEL BY MADELINE KELLY CHAPTER ONE
HERE YOU GO BABE! WEDDING VOWS BY PAUL KENNEDY
-[Emma] This was an amazing night. -[Paul] It was.
[Emma] Yes. I wish it could have gone on forever.
[Paul] Yeah, me too.
-Good night. -Good night.
[man] Those flowers go in the chapel. A perfect morning for a wedding.
Did you get a good shot?
I think so. Yeah.
Um, haven't you got a wedding to get ready for?
Yeah, I'm just taking a moment.
I'll leave you to it.
James. I'm really sorry about last night.
No apologies necessary.
You've had a lot going on.
-I read your book. -You mean Paul's book.
I know what I said. It's better than his other books.
A lot better.
Wonder how that happened.
I didn't change all that much.
-Why do you do that? -Do what?
It's one thing to edit a book,
but you shouldn't go on editing your own life.
[Maddie] I'm not editing my own life, I just…
I know this might sound strange, but I'm not sure this is supposed to be my life.
If that's the case, then now is the time to speak up.
Is this what you really want, Maddie?
Is Paul really the person you want to share the rest of your life with?
Marrying Paul is my wish come true.
Okay.
Then why are you so sad?
Right this way.
Your veil is spectacular. You look amazing.
Well, this is it. I can't believe it's all happening.
Me neither. Can you do me a favor and see if my mom's arrived?
-She's not answering her phone. -Yeah, absolutely. I'm on it.
Okay, thank you.
Hi, Father.
Are you ready, Madeline?
Uh, I guess so.
-You guess? -I'm just…
Father, I think I've done something wrong.
What is it, my dear?
I made a wish to Saint Brigid.
Is that all? You have to be careful with that one. She's known to have a bit of a sense of humor.
Oh. What does that mean?
Well, when you ask her for something, she may not give you what you want,
but she'll always give you what you need.
Oh, that's my cue.
It's all going to work out just fine. I'll see you out there.
Oh! It's starting.
Ah! Are my eyebrows even?
That makeup artist Olivia hired has serious 'tude.
-And I think I pissed her off. -You look great. Mm…
-I'm sorry, Em. -Hmm?
About what?
You and Paul.
What are you talking about?
I know you two have feelings for each other.
I saw you on the patio last night.
Nothing happened.
I've known you since we were kids, Em. It's all right. You can tell me.
[whispering] Maddie.
Do you believe in fate?
Sometimes.
See, I don't know why,
but from the moment I met Paul,
it just… it just felt like we were supposed to be together.
In another life, maybe we would have been.
Just not this one.
I can't believe you're taking this so well.
This is your big day, and I'm ruining it.
It's not your fault. Really.
I'm gonna try to make things right.
Excuse me.
-Hi. -[Paul] Stop, stop, stop.
-Hello. -[woman] Is that the dress?
-What's going on? -Oh, dear.
What's she wearing? Where's the family wedding dress?
Hi, there.
Um, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Maddie. The bride.
Or at least I was supposed to be.
Of course, uh, you know Paul.
He's a really great guy, and a good writer too.
People often tell me that I need to speak up for myself.
So, here it goes.
I really care about Paul…
…but I'm not in love with him.
And I'm pretty sure he feels the same way about me.
Maddie.
[Maddie] I just think that if you're gonna go through with something like this,
like a wedding, and a marriage, and a life,
that it should be with someone you love, not just someone you wish for.
It should be with someone you find,
or even someone who finds you.
I'm sorry. This is unacceptable! Paul, how did you let this happen?
Me?
It's all his fault.
-The photographer? -I saw you with Maddie this morning.
At the lily pond.
Wait, what about you and Emma last night on the patio?
Oh, that's irrelevant. This joker is trying to steal my bride.
At least I'm not stealing Maddie's ideas and calling them my own.
-What are you talking about? -Your latest book.
Well. [scoffs]
I wrote that book.
No, you didn't. I wrote that book.
And there you have it.
-[guests gasp] -Paul, stop.
No. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
No. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Come here!
No! Stop. Let go of him.
Maddie, this is not helping.
Paul, stop it!
-My leg. -Oh!
[Olivia] Sean, don't just stand there! Do something! -Come on, son. You got this. -[grunts]
-Steady does you. -Who's that?
-[Kory] Leave my brother alone! -Mom? Where are you?
Don't panic, but I am in the hospital in Des Moines.
-What? Are you all right? -[Rosemary] I'm fine.
I've just got a fracture of the metatarsal
and a little bump on the head, but I remember everything now.
Honey, tell me. The wedding. Was it everything you ever dreamt of?
[Paul] Kory!
Not in a million years.
Why are you not getting him? Help me! Help me get him.
Get off my foot! Get off!
What's wrong with you? What? Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back.
James!
Who are you helping?
Paul. Are you hurt?
No, I don't think so.
I can't believe you called me irrelevant.
What?
I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry! Come back!
Oh my God. Let's keep him out of this.
James.
Wait, James.
I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have stayed on this job. I've become too emotionally involved.
-You have? -You heard Paul in there.
He thinks I'm responsible for all this, and if I'm being honest, I probably am.
You're not.
If I ever made you doubt yourself, then I am truly sorry.
-But-- -The best thing I can do is just…
walk away from you.
But none of this is your fault.
I really wish you all the happiness in the world.
I can't be happy without you.
I know this doesn't make sense right now,
but I believe in my heart that we're meant to be together.
Not like this.
James, stop!
-Goodbye, Maddie. -[gasps]
Okay, I'm here!
I know you're here, Saint Brigid. You can come out now!
Please! This was all a mistake.
Paul, the wedding, James.
Just take it back!
Saint Brigid!
There's no need to shout, dear.
I'm right here.
I need to unwish my wish.
I'm afraid that's impossible. That wish has already been granted.
But everything has gone horribly wrong.
Has it? Or has it gone exactly as it was supposed to?
No, you're right, and I've learned my lesson.
I have to live my own destiny. Well, then, that's different.
Wait, come back. Where are you going?
Please, Saint Brigid, let me unwish my wish!
Okay.
Okay. I can do this.
I just need a little wind.
Where's the wind? Okay.
Okay, just a little breeze. Give me something.
I'll take anything you got. Okay.
Just take back my wish!
Is anybody in here?
[gasps] What are you doing?
-Why aren't you dressed? -That's a bridesmaid's dress.
Uh, yes, and it's supposed to be on the bridesmaid.
-The ring is gone. -What ring?
That's Paul and Emma.
Is everything okay?
This is amazing! Ah!
I'm glad you think so. Let's get moving.
-Hi, Mom. -[Rosemary] Sweetheart.
Oh, how's your foot?
My foot? Oh, you mean my arthritis.
Oh, that hasn't acted up since I've been using that glucosamine.
-That is such good news! -[Rosemary] Aw.
Thank you, honey.
James?
Oh, sorry.
Right. Here we go.
Thank you.
Whiskey, please.
-Great reception. -Yeah.
-[bartender] Here you go. -Thank you.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
[Heather] Okay, fine. He's not into me.
I'm moving on.
-Good for you. -Thank you.
Champagne, please.
-Well, hello, handsome. -Hi.
-Fancy a dance? -Oh, yeah. Sure.
All right. Say less.
-Hey. -Hey, having fun?
Yeah, it was a beautiful ceremony. And you got to wear your own dress.
Wouldn't have happened without you.
Look, Maddie, I spent my whole life looking for someone like Paul.
I couldn't be happier for you.
Oh, there's the photographer. Is my lipstick still on?
It's perfect.
There's my girl.
Congratulations, Paul. Emma is an incredible person.
-You're lucky to have her. -We're all lucky.
I just got off the phone with the publisher.
The US numbers are huge. They want a sequel right away.
Now obviously, I'm going on my honeymoon for a month,
so do you mind starting the story without me?
That depends.
On what?
Am I gonna get co-writing credit?
Madeline, that's not how it works. I get the sole credit.
You edit the story, and my name sells the books.
That's why we're a perfect team.
You know what, Paul? That's not how a team works.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to fly solo on this one.
Where are you going?
To write my own story.
-Thank you, Murphy. -Sláinte.
What can I get for you?
Hi, I'm looking for James Thomas. He's renting a room upstairs.
James? He's left. You just missed him.
Oh. I did?
-[Murphy] Maybe you'll catch him. -Okay, uh, thank you.
-You're welcome. -Thank you so much.
[Maddie] Is this seat taken?
Um, depends if you'll try to steal my bag again.
-Thanks. -It's okay.
-Well, this is a coincidence. -It's a small village.
-So you're a nature photographer, right? -Mm-hmm.
I was wondering if I could get your advice on something.
All right.
I'm doing some research on the Bolivian tree lizard.
They're endangered, you know.
I've just been offered a job in Bolivia to photograph that lizard.
-When are you leaving? -Well, I'm not. I turned the job down.
You did? Well, just after you got off that bus,
I, uh, met this very interesting woman
who encouraged me to stick around for a while.
See what might happen.
How long are you gonna be in Ireland for?
As long as it takes.
I'm planning on writing a book on the Cliffs of Moher.
Do you know them?
One of my favorite spots.
Mine too.
Maybe we could go there together sometime.
I'd like that.
What's the book about?
[Maddie] I have this crazy idea.
-[James] Fancy something to eat later? -[Maddie] I'd love that.
[James] I know a lovely little pub we can go to.
[Maddie] Can we play darts? Absolutely.
There's even live music.
-[Maddie] Do you dance? -[James] Yes. Yes, I do.
You're crazy.
I'm putting Team Two on the case. You're out.
I'm going to catch Lee.
You want to catch Mr. Lee?
Do it. I'll help you.
Among the dead was a female factory worker.
He is her son.
Did Mr. Lee really do this?
Who is Mr. Lee?
Let's go get Mr. Lee.
There's a salt factory in Taean.
There are two chemists, both geniuses.
But they were born with problems communicating.
Say "hello." This is Brian, the director.
Brian? He wasn't on the list.
Welcome, Chairman Jin.
I am indeed Mr. Lee.
I know Mr. Lee.
When you obsess over one person for a long fucking time,
you develop this inexplicable and odd conviction.
So, why doesn't it feel real to me?
What is it?
Mr. Lee sent this.
You supposedly sent it here. Yet you don't know?
You son of a bitch.
Get up, asshole.
What the hell are you all doing?
But your biggest mistake
was your delusion that you could genuinely become Mr. Lee.
And your reckless bravado, pretending to be Mr. Lee in front of me.
I sincerely apologize from the bottom of my heart
for my delusion and reckless bravado, so please--
Shit.
I told you that I had faith in you.
You ended up catching him.
You little…
Mr. Lee is heading to the first floor.
Shouldn't we report this?
Move! Move aside!
-What the… -Someone must've fainted.
Oh no.
Laika.
Damn it.
We have to make a quick stop.
The sources of Ewoo Shipping's funds.
With both dead, Brian will lose his sources of funds.
That means he won't have any money to repay Jin Ha-rim's gang.
He can pay back with Laika.
You idiot. We failed to make it.
Don't you remember seeing that mess?
Fuck.
The police took all the raw materials.
Who told you about these punks?
Park Sun-chang.
He said it before he lost his arm.
That son of a bitch. We should've cut off both his arms.
Well, why didn't you kill Brian?
He's still useful.
His raw material factories are all over the country.
We must get our hands on the raw materials first and make Laika.
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY
And?
Lee will come.
Do you know where Lee is?
I'll find out soon.
I sent an invitation in Bo-ryeong's hand yesterday.
Do you think Lee will like the invitation?
If it's the Lee I know…
then she'll lead us
to the place
where the real Lee is.
DALIAN
Those fuckers.
It's over 99% pure.
Good grief.
Ewoo Shipping.
They contacted our gang
prior to expanding their business to China.
After that, Director Ha-rim visited Korea, checked their product himself,
and then signed a deal to purchase 5 kg of Laika.
We also provided the raw materials to manufacture the product.
So they did make 5 kg of Laika,
but it was confiscated by the Korean police. It's pretty much gone now.
How much material did we hand over?
About 20 billion at current rates, in Korean won.
Who was the proxy for Ewoo Shipping in this contract?
Here.
So our great director, Jin Ha-rim,
provided them with 20 billion worth of material,
only for him to return dead with just this sample in his hand?
A great fucking job.
I received a report that they confirmed seeing 5 kg of Laika, just like that sample.
So it looks like Ewoo Shipping did actually make the product.
When do we need to get this to the buyer?
We have about 15 days left.
Call them and tell them not to worry. That we'll meet the deadline.
But we're almost out of the raw materials.
Last time, Director Ha-rim
grabbed everything he could find and took it all to Seoul.
Do you plan on going to Korea yourself?
I should go.
I should go teach them what happens if they dare to cross us.
Please tell me the evidence number.
Sure, evidence number 13 from Yongsan Station.
Excuse me, Detective.
Let me just see if it turns on.
-I'll just scan the barcode. -Sure, wait.
Damn it.
Are you still certain it's Seo Young-rak?
Why are you so obsessed with him? I really don't get it.
By any chance…
is it because of Dong-woo and Soo-jung?
Good work.
A doctor already stopped by.
I'm with the Department of Neurology.
Let me see the chart.
Hallelujah.
I froze your accounts immediately,
but they were already fully withdrawn.
It looked like Seo Young-rak's doing.
Our dear Mr. Seo Young-rak must be dying to get some attention.
I lost the war,
so I was bound to lose it as spoils of war.
There is no need to dwell on it.
So, when will she arrive from China?
She's expected to arrive in two days on a day flight.
That traveler…
will lead us to the promised land.
Put our team on this case.
Do you think we're here to pick a meal at a Chinese restaurant?
All matters concerning Ewoo Shipping were transferred to Central Investigation.
We can always cooperate, can't we?
Our current case is nearly done, so we can handle it.
Ever seen a regional squad on a drunken assault case?
Take it easy. Consider it a reward.
There's no reason at all for me to be rewarded.
Why not? You captured the infamous Mr. Lee.
How many times do I have to tell you? Brian is not Mr. Lee.
Are you still on that? You still think Seo Young-rak is Mr. Lee?
The police seized Laika worth over 20 billion won
from the Yongsan incident, Commissioner.
Also, two directors in charge of his slush funds were abducted.
Isn't it obvious who's behind this? Mr. Lee is still standing strong.
It's out of our hands.
Don't dig into, touch, or even think about it.
What if the real Mr. Lee is caught? What will you do then?
My specialty is bowing my fucking head in front of the cameras.
But if you cause trouble again by trying to catch Mr. Lee,
-bowing won't be enough. -Commissioner!
There's only one reason I let you off for the death of that girl and Dong-woo.
You caught Mr. Lee.
So end this at Yongsan Station while I'm still being nice.
Do you punks think this is your bedroom? Haven't you learned to knock?
Check out what's on TV.
…was killed, and together they escaped the hospital.
Lee was known as Mr. Lee,
the boss of the biggest drug ring in Asia.
During an internal conflict…
Seriously.
WELCOME TO KOREA SEOB SO-CHEON
You look nicer than the photo
and much more beautiful in person.
Do you know who I am?
Of course I do.
Director Seob So-cheon.
In China, instead of using your name,
people call you Big Knife.
So, where's all the Laika?
Regrettably, at this moment,
everything has been seized by the police.
They were like my own children.
It feels like the sky has fallen in.
And you have no plans to repay if you don't have the product?
Of course, that was my initial plan.
But I ran into an unexpected roadblock.
Two of my directors suddenly disappeared.
At the same time,
the Laika raw materials we secretly hid also went missing.
What a long-winded story.
In conclusion,
you don't have the product, money, or raw materials.
So, why am I here to see you today?
Mr. Seo Young-rak.
Not only does he currently have the product and the money in his hands,
but he's the only chemist who can manufacture the finest Laika.
On top of that, I have an ample amount of raw materials in Thailand.
It's probably twice the amount I lost.
I heard that Mr. Lee
also has factories in a hot country.
So what?
As you can see,
it is a bit difficult for me to be physically present here.
If you can help me get to that place,
I will compensate you
for the raw materials you lost and then some.
What do you think?
Well,
Jin Ha-rim wasn't the only one
who fell victim to that fellow.
I heard Jin Ha-rim was your stepbrother.
You must be totally heartbroken.
Yes, so fucking heartbroken.
You have ample raw materials in your warehouse?
Ample indeed.
Captain Jo.
I have identified the person named on the ATM receipt.
Kim Jae-seok. Born in 1958 and died in 1994.
Thirty-seven at the time.
He was married to Lee Myeong-hui, and they had a child.
The money was wired for the columbarium maintenance.
All right. Could you also check the travel records for these two?
Yes, sir.
Kim Jae-seok. Ewoo Shipping. These assholes, man.
I've got the digital forensics result on Park Sun-chang's cell phone.
According to the log,
he ran a factory reset once every 24 hours.
It's as if he has OCD.
He kept deleting files between those resets.
I thought we had his GPS location data.
Luckily, he used a navigation app on his phone,
so we have a record.
Also, this is CCTV footage from Brian's factory.
That must be Seo Young-rak, right?
That crazy bastard. Will he really manufacture Laika again and sell it?
I checked Kim Jae-seok's travel records as you requested.
Kim Jae-seok majored in theology at university.
After graduating, he worked abroad with a volunteer group.
He married Lee Myeong-hui, another volunteer,
and moved to Cambodia in 1990, where he ran a farm.
Someone from the Korean Association at the time remembers those two.
Where's that person now?
I'll check and let you know right away.
Okay.
We'll search every location within two kilometers of the highway
where Park Sun-chang spent more than ten minutes.
There must be a hidden factory in one of those spots, and there,
we'll find Seo Young-rak.
Fuck.
It's disgusting. I'm about to barf.
Can we make 12 with these?
It's just enough.
Let's get two of them outside.
Can we make it here?
I think we can make it here.
Hey.
Take your hands off unless you want to die.
Who the hell are these punks?
And what's in the back of your truck?
I'm Mr. Seo Young-rak from HQ.
HQ?
Recently, I heard that rats have been coming in and out of empty factories.
have been coming in and out of empty factories.
Right? So it was you, Mr. Seo.
Right?
Chief Woo.
You all used to work here, right?
I've heard of a force taking over the factory
I've heard of a force taking over the factory after being unfairly dismissed.
But I didn't expect you to still be here.
Tell me about it. I didn't know either.
There must be a misunderstanding.
The company didn't send us.
Then who did?
Do you think I don't see or hear just because I'm stuck in here?
I already know everything that's going on now.
Just piss off while I'm still being nice.
I have lots to do with those.
Yet another misunderstanding.
We aren't here to steal something. We're here to work.
Work?
Yes.
We have enough raw materials, as you can see from the truck outside.
We came here to make Laika with those raw materials.
It's the only place to run the engine without drawing attention.
The three of you are going to make Laika?
There's something I'd like to show you.
Hey.
Move slowly.
-Hey, Dong-su. -Yes.
Huh? I think it's real.
Careful.
Hello?
Hey.
Take him to the hospital if he's sick.
I can't take him right now.
It's not like I don't want to. What's with you?
I can't go. Good grief, what's up with you?
I also want to…
I'll call you later.
Let's go.
We need to check two more places tonight.
Yes, sir.
It's better to change the bandage more often.
I saw the others you were with taking the dog somewhere.
They went into town to find an animal clinic.
It needed new bandages and an anti-inflammatory shot.
You know what'll happen if you do anything funny, right?
Funny? Like what?
All the raw materials are here, and so am I.
So, what do you plan to do with the money from selling the drugs?
What do you think? I gotta go home.
What the heck are those?
Hey, you guys go and check.
Okay.
You fucker! I told you not to do anything funny--
Did you come from China?
I like how quick-witted you are.
What were you doing here, Mr. Seo?
I was making Laika.
I'm sure that's why you're here, and my survival depends on it.
What kind of mess is this?
Your story doesn't add up.
Fine, let's say you're making this. What about the raw materials?
These fall short by a long shot.
If you give me a bit more time, I can make the amount I promised.
Promise?
Did you make me a promise?
I did.
With Mr. Jin Ha-rim.
If I have enough raw materials, I can make ten times, no, twenty times the Laika you lost during this incident.
I can make ten times, no, twenty times the Laika you lost during this incident.
I believe I can do a lot for you.
I'd like to meet Mr. Lee.
Captain Jo. I've called for backup, so we should go in together.
We have no time to wait.
-Captain Jo, please. -Are you crazy?
What if we lose him again?
-You punk. Darn it. -Captain Jo.
I'm scared.
-Then stay out of it. -Captain Jo!
Damn it.
I know that you work for Mr. Lee.
-Please let me work with you too. -Why?
Tell me.
Because I can help Mr. Lee with whatever he wants.
Help? Help with what?
I'm all Mr. Lee needs.
He must've given you the order to retrieve the Laika by any means.
I'm sure Mr. Lee would want me as well.
Freeze!
Hey, freeze. Do not move.
Oh, that man.
Don't move, asshole! Stay where you are, got it?
Captain Jo, are you all right?
Block the entrance first. Don't lose them.
You block the entrance?
Kang Duk-cheon!
Kang Duk-cheon! Hey, where are you?
Duk-cheon!
Hey.
Kang Duk-cheon!
Kang Duk-cheon.
When your enemy is hungry, feed him.
When he is thirsty, let him have water to drink.
NOTICE TO APPEAR NAME: JO WON-HO
Didn't I make myself clear when I signed off on the case?
I told you to finish it at Lee In-mu.
Didn't I tell you not to mess with others?
You…
You are suspended for six months, my orders.
Be prepared for worse when the committee convenes!
He always worked overtime, overnight, and even on weekends.
But still, I never once said a bad thing about you.
If anything were to happen to Duk-cheon,
I knew you'd protect him. I was certain you'd do that.
Our child was sick, so I begged him to come home.
I said I'd call you myself, but he flat out said no.
I am so sorry.
Don't pay your respects, just go. Duk-cheon…
is too nice and will accept it.
But I don't want to.
Please leave.
I have the address of the person who remembers Kim Jae-seok and his wife.
I have the address of the person who remembers Kim Jae-seok and his wife. GARDEN FARM ADDRESS
It's a garden farm in Yongsang-dong, Andong, North Gyeongsang Province.
I checked the farm's business license,
and everything seemed normal.
Let's visit on the weekend after checking the factories.
We have no time to waste.
Tell them we're coming tomorrow.
I don't think I can make it tomorrow…
What do you mean?
What's more important right now?
Right?
Yes, sir.
Once we arrive and secure the materials, kill them by tearing them apart.
"I'm sorry, Director Lee." Try saying that to me.
Go on.
Why did you reveal my location to Big Knife?
Now you can't mess with me because of Laika, if anything.
You made me like this,
so it still wouldn't be enough
even if I pulled out your eyeballs and smashed your head.
But sadly, I couldn't…
Despite that,
I'm seeing the big picture.
I'm from Dongbu Police Station.
A detective?
Yes. By any chance, do you know Mr. Kim Jae-seok?
Oh, yes. Yes, I do indeed.
I remember Kim Jae-seok's family.
His kid was the same age as my son,
so we'd take turns babysitting when needed.
Wasn't their kid named U-ram or something?
Did you live nearby?
Everyone lived near each other in Koreatown.
Anyway, there were rumors that he planted poppies, opium flowers,
or something of that sort.
That's why I remember him.
Yes, right.
He mentioned working in partnership with a Chinese person, I think.
A Chinese person? What does his partner do?
No idea. He was called "Mister," as if he was a schoolteacher.
But I have no idea what he did.
"Mister"?
Between us, we just called him Mr. Lee, I think.
Something like that.
"Mr. Lee."
When I first got into this business,
there was this chemist on Jeju Island who used to supply the drugs.
Someone who went around blabbering that he was Mr. Lee.
Then one day,
he came across them.
Are you Mr. Lee?
Fuck.
Having fun?
Why do you have that noisy lightbulb on in the middle of the day?
Why?
I will never… Please…
I can explain everything.
I've come across three Mr. Lees just this year.
Why do you keep messing with Mr. Lee, ending up in situations like this?
Mr. Im, Mr. Choi, Mr. Park.
And…
I can't remember.
Please spare my life.
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.
Why do you always behave as you please?
Do not meddle with me.
Don't you know that chemists are dying out?
How immature.
Still struggling to judge which to kill and which to spare?
So-cheon.
When you tried to kill me in Macao,
I suggested that we chop your head off,
but Bo-ryeong stopped me.
"We should let her live."
"Don't you pity her?"
Damn it.
I suddenly came to my senses when she told me that.
"I'll let her live."
"I'll leave her to be pathetic,
just as she has always been."
If you keep meddling with everything, you'll lose your head.
If you keep meddling with everything, you'll lose your head. You know what things are like here.
You know what things are like here.
You'll end up dead.
Come here.
Oh Lord.
To be frank, I wasn't entirely sure,
but that was when I found out
that Mr. Lee was a real person
and that he never showed mercy to those
who assumed his identity.
Knowing that, you still chose to impersonate him.
Why?
Do you know the real name of that man called Mr. Lee?
Or his age or his hometown? Anything at all.
Well, he never talked about himself.
Oh, I heard that he used to work at a school in Busan, near Chinatown.
There's one man in here.
Lee Yang-gwak.
-Born in 1955. -One second.
Sure.
He was a science teacher
who worked here from 1988 to 1990.
Oh, he went to Thailand as part of our exchange student program.
-Thailand? -Yes.
Not Cambodia?
-No, take a look right here. -Yes.
It says he went to a school in Thailand.
Captain Jo!
Captain Jo.
HQ is in chaos because of you.
The commissioner totally lost it.
I'll go with you.
That's enough.
What are you going to do?
You don't have any right to investigate over there.
People there won't take any notice you.
I'm coming with you.
I told you, that's enough.
-Please proceed to the departure hall. -Yes, thank you.
Captain Jo.
Captain Jo!
THAILAND KRABI
Five days. Five kilograms.
The finest.
Five kilograms of the finest.
If I make it in five days, what's next?
I never said you could ask questions.
Do I get to meet Mr. Lee?
You keep bringing up Mr. Lee with that trap of yours again and again.
Damn it.
-You asshole! -Not yet. Get the materials first.
Thank you, God the Father.
Have some tea. Please stay seated.
Have some tea. Please stay seated. Oh, okay.
I know Mr. Lee very well.
He's such a tall and handsome man.
I see.
I graduated from this school. Everyone here loves him.
Anyway, how did you come to know Mr. Lee?
I was indebted to him before,
so I came by to say hello to him since I'm here in Thailand.
Oh, I see. You've come to the right place.
Do you happen to know where Mr. Lee is right now?
Oh, Loomfangsoh.
-Loom… -That's the name of the town.
-Oh, I see. -Yes.
That's where he lives. Give me a second. He might be…
He might be back home by now. One second.
How interesting.
A Korean detective showed up there?
A Korean detective…
I'm sorry.
I hope I'm not bothering you.
I'll talk to him and send him away.
If we mess with him, things may get out of hand.
Bury him.
Yes, I understand.
Oh, he said he'd be home soon, so why don't we leave first?
Let me escort you there. I live nearby too.
Oh, you don't have to.
It's okay. I think Mr. Lee will arrive while we're on the road.
I see.
Where did Mr. Seo Young-rak go?
The cars went in two directions.
Just as I expected,
Big Knife has poor manners.
I'm sorry.
Did those mute drug chemists arrive?
Yes, they arrived this morning.
You have one message.
It's me.
There's a problem.
I arrived somewhere, but I have no idea where I am.
Listen up.
You must find Captain Jo.
He has a GPS tracker that shows my location.
You must follow my location on that tracker at all costs.
First off, let's find that man.
Head onto Jay.
And at last…
we can finally see the end approaching.
This way, please.
Oh my. I guess Mr. Lee isn't here yet.
Oh, I see.
Should we wait inside, then?
-Sure. -He'll be here.
I sometimes come by to clean his house and stuff.
There. Please come inside.
Sure.
What?
Nice try.
Go in.
You know, you're going to regret this, Detective.
Go in.
What to do?
Hey, I'm hungry.
We have no time.
Not bad.
Quite ordinary.
I'll take that one.
Hurry up. We're in a hurry. We have no time.
Hey, come on. Get up now.
Damn it.
Shit, man.
I mean, what on earth are you hoping to achieve
by bothering Mr. Lee and relentlessly looking for him?
I heard Mr. Lee was already caught in Korea,
but I guess that wasn't the case, Captain Jo Won-ho.
You're right. He wasn't.
We still have a long way to go before this is over.
Damn. Why on earth are you smiling?
Captain Jo.
Pull yourself together. Do you have any idea where you are?
Loomfangsoh.
It means a grave.
Your grave.
Now.
Now, let's go.
Exactly.
-Yes, exactly. -Huh? What?
I have no business with you.
Bring me your fucking boss.
What?
Fuck!
SEOB SO-CHEON
Man.
Oh my. Look who it is.
We meet here, Captain Jo.
I'm the one that's useful, not you.
The moment you handed me over to that woman,
you became useless to Mr. Lee.
Once we arrive in Thailand,
he'll find the right time
and try to harm me.
There are two people at Mr. Lee's beck and call.
One is Jin Ha-rim, who is in charge of managing his gang.
The other is Big Knife, Seob So-cheon, in charge of cleaning up the trash.
But that woman is…
unbelievably jealous.
She even framed Jin Ha-rim as a traitor in Macao and tried to kill him
just to have Mr. Lee's attention all to herself.
That's why
she'll protect Mr. Lee's factory more tenaciously than ever.
And she will lead us
to that land flowing with milk and honey.
It won't be that easy to take over the factory.
No, of course. It won't be easy.
But if you give me a hand, Mr. Seo,
that will make things a little easier.
Under one condition.
Keep Captain Jo alive and hand him over to me.
Oh, Captain Jo Won-ho?
I need him for my final plan.
Am I, by any chance, in the last part of that plan?
Oh, Director Seob.
Oh, the merciful Director Seob.
Mr. Seo Young-rak, speak of the devil.
Did you check the message?
Of course I did.
What about Captain Jo?
This is such a profound romance story.
Now, I'll let the lovers…
talk to each other.
Hey, Seo Young-rak. Explain this situation right now.
Are you all right?
What the hell is going on right now?
We're all on the same team, that's what.
Are you trying to be funny or something?
It's simple.
Director Lee, myself, and you, Captain Jo,
all want Mr. Lee.
We're more desperate to reach the goal in front of us.
So, you want us to forget everything, cooperate, and get what we want?
Brian wants to be Mr. Lee.
I want to capture Mr. Lee.
But you know,
I have no idea what on earth you want from Mr. Lee.
Let me ask you one last thing.
Are you doing this for Kim Jae-seok and Lee Myeong-hui?
All right, then.
Shall we proceed to the land that flows
with milk and honey?
Did you see the sample?
How was it?
Hello?
Mr. Lee?
-What do you want? -Jay sent these.
I can now wrap up this matter without any problems.
Yes, of course. I'm not worried.
Have you read the report?
I have.
What do you think?
The product was quite nice.
Really? I'm so happy, Mr. Lee.
I work very hard, you know.
I'm here with the chemist who made the sample.
Do you want me to put him on?
I didn't call you to talk about Laika.
You don't have to send me reports anymore.
I called to tell you that.
I only gave you permission to continue the business under my name.
It wasn't permission to hold back someone who had already left.
But I made up for everything.
So, Dad…
I mean, Mr. Lee.
That means you have to come back.
So-cheon.
My retirement isn't because of your mistake.
All I want to do now is relax here with my family.
You should visit sometime.
Come by and have dinner with us.
What's he talking about?
Why does everyone just do as they please?
Where's Mr. Lee right now?
So-cheon is still a kid.
13 YEARS AGO CHINA
LEGAL OPINION
She likely did it without knowing the outcome.
SEOB SO-CHEON ACTS ON DELUSIONAL IMPULSES
AND HAS NO REMORSE FOR THESE ACTIONS…
I'll let this go.
Mr. Lee.
Please give her one more chance.
Do you wish to save a girl who wants to kill you?
I almost got freaking killed.
So-cheon.
Because of you.
Lying is an awful thing.
Did you think I wouldn't know
if you framed your older brother with a lie?
So-cheon.
Why do you hate Ha-rim so much?
Are you jealous?
Are you anxious that Ha-rim will take your place?
Can you see well?
Dad.
Hello? Ha-rim, it's me.
If So-cheon messes up again,
feel free to take matters into your own hands.
I told you never to call me that.
Why?
Do you need family?
Isn't that a luxury
you can't afford?
Will you talk to him?
Ask Mr. Lee to come.
Offer him the Laika.
Yes, so where is Mr. Lee?
I will
destroy all of you, starting with you.
No, you cannot die just yet.
Because I'll end your life very slowly.
All of you who dared to irritate Mr. Lee.
I will…
I will ask Mr. Lee to come here.
I'll tell him I'll make the Laika.
You will?
You will tell him?
Really?
Yes.
Then do it quickly, okay?
So, where is Mr. Lee? Huh?
Dad! He's my dad!
Don't you dare say his name with your mouth!
Dear Lord.
My Lord.
So,
was Big Knife handled properly?
That devil of a bitch.
What's your plan now?
There's still one more person to take care of.
Man, this bastard.
To be frank,
these guys and I didn't expect much from you.
I keep telling you over and over again
that I can't die until I capture Mr. Lee.
that I can't die until I capture Mr. Lee. So either we survive all together here, or you die alone.
So either we survive all together here, or you die alone.
Pick one of the two.
I wasn't talking about you, Captain Jo.
I was talking about Mr. Seo Young-rak.
There was something I had overlooked all along.
The fact that Mr. Lee is an actual person and that I'm a fake Mr. Lee.
and that I'm a fake Mr. Lee.
How did our dear Mr. Seo Young-rak…
know everything?
You asshole, you're…
Let go!
Let go of me, you jerk! You… Man…
Damn it.
Shit.
Mr. Seo Young-rak.
Talk to me.
That day…
there was someone else you failed to see.
Shut up!
I'll do what I want!
So, you were there, Mr. Seo Young-rak?
I also learned…
something very important that day.
If I pretended to be Mr. Lee,
I'd encounter the real Mr. Lee's minions.
And if I followed the movements of those minions,
I'd be able to meet the real Mr. Lee.
That's why I was honestly thrilled when you showed up
pretending to be Mr. Lee.
While all eyes were on you,
I was able to complete my plan.
I leaked the Laika sample to get Mr. Lee's attention.
Yes, sir.
Then I intentionally emptied factories to expose my location and get captured.
And I helped you plan the finale.
I must have…
underestimated you, Mr. Seo.
I offer
my humble repentance before the Lord.
But here's the thing with humans.
When they become complacent,
their judgment becomes clouded.
That's why they join hands with anyone
and easily put their trust in them.
You leaked the Laika samples to intrigue Mr. Lee,
intentionally exposed the factory's location to get caught,
and helped me plan the finale as well.
Think about it.
Mr. Seo Young-rak,
you are making the same mistakes I made a month ago.
Your delusion that you have won, right?
Your reckless bravado in thinking you can find Mr. Lee.
Five kilograms of the finest Laika.
That should be…
more than enough for you to assume Mr. Lee's name from this day on.
No.
That's not what I'm talking about.
In the meantime, I've conducted thorough research on you, Mr. Seo.
"Who is this man?"
"How did he discover the difficult formula for Laika?"
"My plan is simple, but why is he so complicated?"
I couldn't quite figure it out.
"Okay."
"I have no choice. I should try offering him a deal."
But of course,
I made the mistake of underestimating you
and ended up looking like this.
"Revenge?"
"Oh, it was revenge. Yes, it was your revenge."
"Perhaps Mr. Seo will try even harder
to look for Mr. Lee than I will."
Listen up, Mr. Seo Young-rak.
Those two will come with me.
And they will work very hard
to make the Laika for me.
Those two can't produce the Laika without me.
Do you really think so?
What are you doing?
What?
What? Stop it!
She'll never be able to see again.
Stop it!
This is entirely your fault, Mr. Seo Young-rak.
Also…
Listen up.
You will head over,
find Mr. Lee, and get rid of him.
The moment I confirm his death,
I will reconsider whether to let those two…
live or die.
Do you understand?
You were doing this all along to find out where Mr. Lee--
You're talking back to me again.
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Don't do it!
It's all right. It's okay.
It'll be over soon.
I was in a lot of pain as well, you fucking asshole.
Stop it.
I'll do it.
I said I'll do it!
If you think about it…
there were so many twists and turns
over the name "Mr. Lee."
Listen up.
After today, only one person remains
under that name.
This is how you do business, Mr. Seo Young-rak.
Hallelujah.
Captain Jo.
Do you recognize me?
What are you doing here?
This time, I really thought you wouldn't wake up.
I got a call from the Thai police three days ago.
Three days?
They found a drug factory owned by a gang, and you were there.
-Really? -Are you all right?
Man, these punks.
Why is he laughing?
What's your name?
Man, these…
He's Korean, right?
NORWAY BEITOSTØLEN
Your Laika…
was quite impressive.
Thank you.
You're much younger than I expected.
Much younger than me when I first got into this business.
May I ask
how you started making this drug?
At first, it was purely out of academic curiosity.
"What's the limit to the pleasure that the human brain can experience?"
Now I understand
that to get to the limit, you have to go beyond the line.
The line?
All laws and moralities.
The line drawn by humans themselves.
Isn't it quite ironic?
All humans wish to be happy.
But they give up and put up with many things in life
for the sake of happiness, only to end up unhappy.
Do you believe in God?
I don't.
I only believe in proven science.
How would you measure this pleasure quantitatively?
How long does it last?
And is it repeated exactly the same way?
Beautiful, isn't it?
Humans buy happiness,
and I sell it.
You are more arrogant than I thought.
"Arrogant."
Do you remember 25 years ago?
There was a young married couple who got on a smuggler's boat.
You handed over drinking water and food inside a backpack.
That married couple
genuinely trusted your kindness.
But you
decided to brutally betray their trust.
To be honest,
I do not remember.
It's been too long.
Does that sound too cruel?
Then what do you regret?
Family.
To be precise…
how I have changed.
I've become absolutely ordinary.
It's rather easy,
yet boring, to live this ordinary life.
Are they really all of your family?
There was someone really desperate to become your family.
Someone who thought of you as her father.
Her phone helped me find you.
I killed her.
And your family as well.
I killed them.
Looking at you…
reminds me of my old self.
What do you say?
Will you be my family?
Listen.
You don't know…
what family is.
That's a pity.
Now that I can't see either, the world is so quiet.
That's one thing I like about this.
Tell me anything you want to see right now…
or anything you're curious about.
What's the color of the sky right now?
It's bright and clear.
Nice.
What were you thinking when you put a tracker on the Laika?
Just my gut instinct.
Right.
You had a good hunch from the day we met.
In that case…
am I right about this too?
UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR FOUND DEAD AT HOME
I see.
Mr. Lee.
What was Mr. Lee like?
He had a daughter…
and a granddaughter too.
He was kind to his neighbors.
Someone as ordinary as us,
bound to fade away over time.
Why did you call me here?
What were my parents like?
Were they just like Mr. Lee?
Were they worth all my efforts…
to get their revenge?
Do you know how pungent human flesh is when it rots?
Even after I got out of the container where my parents died,
that smell has always haunted me.
No matter how much time passed, it just wouldn't leave me.
That's why I went around looking for Mr. Lee.
I thought the smell wouldn't bother me
once I found him and did everything I wanted.
But I can still smell it.
I did everything I ever wanted to do with my life.
Did you already know I couldn't go back to how things were?
Seo Young-rak.
Take your hand off the gun.
I'll be Mr. Lee.
Will you arrest me?
It's your turn.
Once you accomplish everything you ever wanted to…
can you go back to how things were?
As a reward for his recent achievement in a drug investigation,
the National Police Agency announced a special promotion
for Senior Inspector Jo Won-ho, the Narcotics Unit Captain.
Above all, he was greatly praised
for his unprecedented performance in cooperation with Interpol.
The agency added that Superintendent Jo's persistence
Mr. Hasan is taking so long.
He's not here yet.
I'm thirsty.
Have some coffee while it's hot. Have some coffee, sir. Please.
-We've been waiting for this. -Slowly.
-Thank you. -Enjoy the coffee.
-I want a glass too. -Sure, here's yours, Mr. Yaumil.
-Please wait, ma'am. -Thank you, Ben.
-Thank you, Ben. -You're welcome.
Have some coffee while it's hot.
Please, have some.
Enjoy it while it's hot.
Have some coffee, sir.
-Okay. -So refreshing.
That's Mr. Hasan.
-Hopefully, we hear some good news. -I hope so.
-Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too.
So what's the news, sir?
I have both good and bad news.
The good news is
that the company has agreed to meet our representatives
to discuss and renegotiate the demands.
Praise be to God.
And they'll come up with better offers for us.
Negotiation?
Then what are we doing now?
I think it's better for us to go home and rest.
I don't think that's a good idea.
If we remove the blockade, we're giving them opportunity.
That's right, sir!
Calm down, we have to keep thinking positively.
Calm down, everyone.
Just go home and get some rest.
And we can prepare a better argument for the negotiation.
-Okay? -What's the bad news?
The bad news…
SUSTAINABLE EARTH, NO DEFORESTATION
Move away!
Ouch!
Move!
Sir!
-Retreat! -Retreat!
-Run, you fools! -Run!
They have crossed the line!
What negotiation? This is oppression!
Now, anyone who can go home, please do so.
The ladies and I can provide some help if anyone needs medical treatment.
I'll go find a vehicle for us.
Please. Thank you.
We will need it to carry the injured to the community health clinic.
Take care, Ben.
-Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too.
Hi, coffee boy!
What happened to your face? Did you get into a fight?
I was beaten up by some thugs.
You and your shenanigans…
Go treat your wounds.
It's okay, they're just some minor scratches.
I'm a guy, after all.
What is it?
Well, you have to see this.
Filosofi Diskopi is ready! See?
Ga, turn off the lights!
Cool!
-We'll go ahead with the disco vibe, huh? -Say hi, Aga!
-Beni! -Aga is there?
Hello, Ben!
What happened to him?
It's nothing, just some scratches.
Chill.
Ben, in two days,
we'll launch Filosofi Diskopi.
I'll buy you a ticket, and you have to be here!
I don't think I can join you guys. I've got some problems here.
What are you doing there?
You have to come! Period!
Fine, fine!
You talk too much.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE FOUNDER OF FILOSOFI DISKOPI
-Where's he? -I don't know.
So what about it?
Jody.
Hi!
We didn't find Ben.
What do you mean?
We looked for him all over the airport.
We even asked the staff there, but we didn't find him.
They don't know of any passenger named Beni Susilo.
We couldn't contact his number.
I tried to call him before.
The number you're calling can't be reached.
Please try again in a few minutes.
Where on earth is this guy?
The number you're calling can't be reached.
-See? -Please try again in a few minutes.
Rather than staying here and being worried all by yourself,
why don't you go to Ben's hometown?
The coffee shop?
The boys and I can handle it.
Jod. Ben only has you.
WE ARE READY TO SERVE THE PEOPLE POLICE SERVICE CENTER
Who are you?
Calm down. Don't be scared.
I'm Hasan.
I know who you're looking for.
I'm a friend of Ben's father.
Ben is like my own son.
I've been looking for him as well, but I haven't found anything.
I just reported it to the police.
Any result?
They just said I'm not a direct family member.
So it's no good, right?
We had a clash with company security forces.
A few of the protesters got hurt, so Ben and I took care of them.
Then, Ben left to find some vehicles for us.
We haven't heard anything from him since.
I found his phone.
This is the jungle.
We're all alone here, so watch your back.
Call me if you need anything.
Sir!
-It's in. Thank you. -Okay.
You're welcome.
Miss, do you have a charger for this type of phone?
I have one.
This dimwit…
Mr. Hasan? Can I see you?
Okay, we can meet tonight.
Okay, see you.
Thank you, miss.
-Sir, here's your drink. -Thank you.
Hi. Sorry…
Ma'am. The usual.
Here.
-Here's the money. -Thank you.
Come on.
Thank you, ma'am.
Get out!
Wait a sec…
Wait.
Come on!
Wait a moment.
-Who are you looking for? -Can you put the gun down?
Do you want money?
I can give you money if you want.
You fucktard!
Kneel! Do it!
I'm looking for my friend.
-Here, I have a… -What?
Wait a sec…
This is him.
See?
Where's my friend?
You fucker!
Come on! Quick!
What…?
Open it!
Get in!
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
You fucker…
I thought you were dead. Beni…
Fuck you, Ben.
What are you doing here?
Fuck!
You went missing and I came here for you. You shithead!
Wake up, bro!
If Tubir finds you lazing around, we're dead!
-Let's go get a coffee! -How did you get here?
-Someone gave me your phone… -Don't stay up late!
If you get sick, it'll give me trouble.
That shithead…
A man named Hasan.
Is he okay?
-He's okay. -Thank God.
Who are these people?
They're the elders of the native villages around here.
Some of them are members of farming village communities.
They fought back after the company tried to seize their land.
They're just like me.
We fought back,
so we are held hostage to scare people.
So the villagers will change their minds and agree to be relocated.
Then the company can take their land.
Well…
You better sleep.
Take a rest.
Sure.
-Hurry up, slowpoke! -What is it?
Come on!
City boys… What are you glaring at?
-Huh? -Watch your step!
What now?
-Come on! -Quick!
Come on!
Come on! Hurry up!
Quick!
Hurry up!
Hey!
Come on!
Come on, city boys!
-Hey! -Watch your eyes!
Hurry up!
Fuck…
Come here!
Here! Have some more!
All that muscle, and still carrying them one by one!
Jod, take this…
Don't let them see you being idle. They'll come after you.
-Where should I carry this? -Follow me.
Come on!
Come on! Put that down!
Go back there! Quick!
Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Hey, come here!
What is this symbol?
Eyes, nose… Where is the mouth?
How dare you!
Who's that?
That's the boss.
They call him Tubir.
Tubir?
How do you spell "Ribut" (Noisy) backward?
Tem!
What is it?
Who's that?
Is he a good worker?
You don't know him?
You're so sluggish. Come on!
My leg…
Ben, look over there!
Hey!
Jod! Hey, Jod!
-Fuck you! -Stop!
You're new here? You think you're a hero, huh?
Who are you exactly?
I told you, I came here
to find my friend, Ben, that long-haired guy, mas.
Don't "mas" me!
You think everyone is Javanese, so you can call me "mas"?
Don't you ever "mas" me!
Excuse me.
-This is the water. -Put it over there.
But…
we're not dangerous.
What do you mean "not dangerous"?
Your friend organized a protest!
-He's just being a Mr. Know-It-All. -You are a Mr. Know-It-All!
But he's worse than me
because, in fact, he doesn't know anything.
By the way…
-This is for you. -What is it?
I can give you money too.
But please let us go.
You think money is the answer to everything?
I'm Tubir…
I have my own integrity.
Integrity!
-Cek! -Right here!
Where's my coffee?
What is this?
Is this coffee or sweet stew? You put in too much sugar.
Do it right!
Look! Someone's trying to run away!
Get up!
What is it?
You see what happens if you try me?
If you try to escape?
Got it?
Get in!
Those bastards…
Lie down here.
You shithead!
Shithead!
Stay where you are!
-What? -You shithead!
See?
Don't you dare try to escape!
-Take a look at him. -Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Are you all right?
What did he do to you?
Give me your hand.
We can't let them keep persecuting us like this.
-We have to find a way to fight back. -You're right.
You're right.
Don't let it get to you.
Just eat.
Have you checked over there?
Just eat. What's wrong?
You smart-ass!
What is it?
No wonder he got caught. He didn't plan the escape well.
I have an idea.
What idea?
I don't know how to do it.
But…
That Tubir guy…
He gets mad whenever his boys make him coffee.
Why are you grinning?
You too!
That's it!
What do you do?
You're a barista.
If you can make him like your coffee,
at least you'll be able to walk around this place.
Then we can think about the next strategy.
I see…
That's a good idea.
Time's up!
-Work! -Get up! Time to work!
Wait a sec…
-Wait a sec… -What are you looking at?
Do you think you're Godam? Move your ass and work!
You're not a superhero! Work!
Get up! Stop glaring at me!
-Work! -Let me finish this.
Come on!
-Left? -Like this?
A little bit to the right.
Right!
That's left. I said right!
Up! Just a little bit!
Up! Just a little bit!
-Hey! -There.
The antenna! Cek!
-Yeah? -My coffee!
Can't you do it right?
Your coffee tastes like shit!
Calm down!
-Turn around! -I just want to…
I just want to offer some coffee to Aa Tubir.
-Bullshit! -I can make good coffee. You'll love it.
He talks too much!
-What…? -Shut up!
Aa Tubir…
I'm a barista.
I make coffee every day.
It would be a lie to say my coffee doesn't taste good.
What if it really doesn't?
Then you can just shoot him in the head.
Really?
Tem.
It's done.
Let's go.
Sit down.
You made this?
I did.
It's really good.
Cek! This is real coffee! I can drink it.
Not that sweet stew you always make!
Got it!
Excuse me. sir.
Can I give some to my friends?
Sure, go ahead.
But not too much, since it's so good.
I'll make some more for you next time.
Awesome!
Perfect!
Nice!
Excuse me, Aa.
This is how you make coffee.
Coffee you can drink.
Stupid!
Gentlemen, I have some coffee.
We can share it.
Please…
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
This smells so good.
This is really good.
Take a sip.
Please enjoy.
Thank you, Ben.
Thank you, sir.
Fuck you!
You made my head a bet for Tubir.
But the plan went well, right?
My goodness…
Next…
We can…
Are you planning something?
I can help if you want.
What are you doing? Go and guard the place!
Come here.
Here.
There are two routes leading outside the forest.
The main route is the road they opened.
But choosing this route to get to the main road will be too risky.
I can show you a shortcut instead.
But it's a little complicated.
Their guard is down every time they watch a badminton game.
Gele and Encek fall asleep every time they're on night watch.
Well, these two factors will give you an opportunity to escape.
This route I drew goes all way down.
If you two move fast enough,
you'll be safe from them in ten minutes.
-Got it? -Yes.
Then how can we escape this place?
Ben!
Jody!
How…?
-Nobody's home. -I checked the back and found no one.
Where are they?
I told you that tomorrow is the final, and all I see on the TV is noise!
Stupid!
Can't you do your job properly?
Encek! Watch them!
You know that tomorrow is the game for the children of our nation.
You want them to win, right?
Stupid!
Stupid!
Tomorrow is the final.
Indonesia versus China.
Good!
They'll focus on the game.
You're ready?
So, are we going to escape in a small group?
No.
This is only for you two.
-But… -No, we're old.
We'll only slow you down.
You're young.
You have hope.
The future of this land is in your hands.
Take this chance.
We went to the police.
-But we haven't found any clues. -I see.
It's useless to report it.
But we have tried our own way to keep looking for them.
If there's any news, I'll update you as soon as possible.
We will wait for your good news.
Sure.
As soon as possible.
Get him!
-Watch out! -Get him!
Come on!
-Smash! -That's right!
Come on!
Go!
Come on!
Encek! You dimwit!
You stupid fuck!
-He's just playing around. -You too!
Encek! Go call the coffee guy!
I need to enjoy something good to relax.
What are you looking at?
What do we do now?
What do we do, sir?
Where's the coffee guy?
Yeah!
Move!
They escaped!
Get them!
Wait! Get them!
Come on, Cek!
Get them!
Hurry up!
Come on, Jody!
Shit!
Jod! Jody, come on.
Where are those jerks?
Hey! Ben!
Take this.
What do I do with this? Fuck!
Hurry!
-Where are they? -Over here.
Shit!
Hey! Don't run!
Watch out, Jody!
Fuck!
Hey, chase them!
You do that!
I'm going to look after him. They have a gun.
Jod! Jod, come here!
Cek, help me.
Okay.
Ben, right or left?
Left.
Keep walking!
Fuck…
Jody!
Jody…
Watch out! Hold on to me.
Watch out. Just hold on…
We can shelter there.
Watch out…
Hang on…
We can take shelter here.
-Let me sit here. -No, wait.
Slowly. Come here.
Ouch…
Ben, are you feeling cold?
It's so cold here.
Get closer to the fire.
Come here, get closer to the fire.
Come here. It's warm, right?
Have some rest.
I killed someone…
Ben, I killed someone.
Ben…
Beni…
Ben, please help me.
-Ben. Beni… -Shut up.
Shut up! Shut up, Jod!
Shut up!
Just sleep. Come here.
I'm so tired.
I'm tired.
Jod.
Jod, wake up! Don't fall asleep!
-I'll go find water for you. -Ben…
It's a river, Jod! We made it!
Jody, we made it!
I found the river! Jody!
Jod!
Jody, I found the river!
Wake up! We can get there in five minutes!
We just need to walk a little more.
Put that down.
We're not bad guys.
-Put that down! -We're not bad guys!
Come on!
-Come on, Jago! -Come on.
This is our village. Come on!
Jago, take him to Mak Lis' house.
Okay.
Take him in. The wound needs to get treated.
Okay.
Where were you held hostage?
Where did you get this?
Mak! Mak Lis!
Mak Lis asked me to give this to you. Please drink it.
Just drink it. It's not poisonous.
Thank God, he got help just in time.
If he'd come even a minute later,
he could have been killed by the infection.
Hopefully, by the day after tomorrow, he will be getting better.
Excuse me, Mak Lis.
You. Follow me to the main house.
Can I join them?
Go ahead.
Who are you exactly?
-Did the company send you? -Are you spying on us?
He must be a bad person! For sure!
I told you I'm Ben, I'm a barista. Jody is my bro.
Then why do you have a gun and why is your friend hurt?
Answer me!
I live in the district.
I run a coffee cultivation business.
I've been protesting with produce farmers
because the company planned to take their lands.
Then, one day, the protest turned into a riot.
That night, I was kidnapped.
My friend came here looking for me, and he got kidnapped too.
We were held hostage by illegal loggers with 15 other men.
-We were asked to work and open a route… -How did you manage to escape?
Why only you two? Where are the others?
-Answer me! -Bora!
-Let him finish. -He could be lying to us.
-He must be lying… -Right!
-Tambora! -He's lying!
Come on.
Where's the map?
I know I'm younger than you,
but don't you ever yell at me in front of so many people!
As long as Father isn't home, I'm the guardian of this village.
It's my responsibility.
We haven't heard anything from Father for six months.
I just hope you can lead us the way he did!
He always listened to others.
I just want to say that something is off.
If they were really heading for town,
they shouldn't have crossed the river.
It's either they were fooled
or we are being fooled.
Be honest!
Where did you come from?
I am being honest.
I was just told I had to find the river
to find the main road heading into town.
Mr. Hamid said that!
Mr. Hamid?
Mr. Hamid is the one who gave me the map.
Does he have a scar on his neck?
Father is still alive.
Father is still alive, Tambora.
Father is still alive.
Father…
It was Father who sent Ben and Jody here to tell us that he's still alive.
-Father is still alive. -Father is still alive?
Bring it there.
Jani…
Father is still alive, Jago.
Father is still alive…
Maybe the others are still alive too.
Father is still alive…
You're really something.
You woke up faster than I expected.
Where are we?
We're in Mr. Hamid's village.
They saved us.
I'm Rinjani, Mr. Hamid's first child.
I'm Mak Lis.
I'm the mother of all the children in this village.
I'm Musang.
The cutest kid here.
We made it.
Most of them are farmers.
They've been guarding this village for generations.
Do they go to school?
Those who can afford it go to school, like me.
In the district.
I graduated from high school in the district two years ago.
But for the past few years,
they have been pushing us to move from here.
You mean relocated?
Oh, right. I'm Tambora.
I'm Rinjani's younger sister.
I'm Jody.
We need to find out from you where the captive camp is.
What are you up to?
We want to help our parents escape.
-What else? -Tambora…
It would be better to report it to the police in the city.
So you won't show us the way?
They are well armed there.
We only have a gun with one bullet left.
Do you want to die for nothing?
We can't put our hope in others.
This is the jungle.
Our fate is in our own hands.
Our barn is burning.
Jani!
They went that way!
Bora!
Jani!
There's barely anything left in the barn.
Come on!
You see it now?
The police, you said?
Come on!
What on earth is happening now?
If we go back to the camp, we're only looking for death.
You almost died right in front of me.
I know.
But…
But what?
You came here to find me.
And I'm here with you now.
Alive and well.
We made it.
What do you want now?
I'm grateful for that, Ben.
If not for them, I might be going back to Jakarta as a dead body.
I owe them my life.
What if we just ask them to give us directions?
If we get lost,
we'll take days to find the camp.
We'll waste our time and energy.
What if they refuse?
We can't force them, right?
They saw how my arrow cut through that intruder's body.
You mean we'll threaten them?
You said it yourself.
You're the leader of this village in the absence of our father.
Father said that merely fighting back is not what matters the most.
What matters is how we fight back.
If we threaten Ben and Jody,
how are we different from that evil company?
Good morning.
Excuse me.
I came here to apologize.
I…
I can't…
I haven't had the chance to say thank you
for saving my life.
And I came here
to apologize
because I can't guide you back to the camp.
It's okay.
I understand.
You owe us nothing, Jody.
You can go home.
You deserve to go back to your life.
Jod!
Let's go!
Before it gets late!
Now I understand why you left our shop twice.
What?
You went back to your hometown.
And you live with what you have here.
What are you talking about?
I've been living with so many calculations.
It was all about the math. The numbers.
I forgot that there are more things I can do with my life
than think about numbers.
Are you drunk?
I will go back to the camp.
I'll help Rinjani save the elders of this village.
Are you high? Or drunk?
I can't go back to Jakarta.
-This is not an action movie. -I can't act like nothing happened here.
You think we're Rambo?
That you're Chuck Norris?
Before you act all high and mighty,
remember that I organized a protest to fight that company.
What did I get?
I was kidnapped and beaten up.
And you were there.
We almost died.
We almost lost our lives.
I can't remember how many bullets almost went through our heads.
We work with coffee.
Our job is to make coffee.
We should go back now.
The person killed by Rinjani's arrow got me thinking…
about why I had to kill someone.
Our duty is to survive.
This land is their life.
Their families in the camp are also their lives.
Just imagine…
if Mr. Hamid was my dad…
or your father.
What would we do?
If we choose to go from the south, it's all the way up.
So we need to make a detour so we can get to this height.
And we will pass two intersections.
Right, Ben?
The first intersection is a former road for vehicles.
The second intersection has two overlapping big rocks.
I know that place.
We can go through the Pohon Jangkung forest
and come out north of the foothills.
That's the place where we worked?
-Right? -Yes, right.
This is the logging area.
You have helped us with that information, Musang.
But you need to guard the village. Don't come with us.
No, I will come with you. I can help you all.
It's too dangerous.
Mak Lis needs you.
If we go tomorrow morning,
we can get there at midnight to spy on them.
Thank you for joining us.
I will come with you!
Just go ahead.
I can help.
Musang, if you come with us, who will guard the village?
-You're more needed there. -I can attack from afar.
-Musang, trust me. -I have to go with you.
Your help is needed in our village.
Musang, listen to Bora.
-This is the rock Musang mentioned. -Yes.
Jody and I came from there.
So that way is north.
Looks like there's a guard post there. We'll monitor their movements.
Jod, I'm going with them.
Hey, Beni!
Ben! Wait!
-Who's that? -Fuck!
That stupid guy!
Try to check over there!
Beni, you fucker.
Who's there?
Musang!
-Jago! -Musang?
I told you to guard the village!
Why didn't you listen?
If I'd been late by even a second,
Jago would've got shot and they would've heard the gunshot.
He's right.
Okay then. You can follow us sneaking around.
But do not go into the camp.
Jody, go and look around. You know the place better.
You need this?
You're like Doraemon.
The night guards are Encek and Gele.
We have a chance.
They often fall asleep on night duty.
Can I borrow that?
Can you see anything?
Shit!
What is Mr. Hasan doing here?
Let me see.
He gave you my phone.
Before you met Encek, you made an appointment with him.
-That's really Mr. Hasan. -He fooled me.
What is it?
That man is Mr. Hasan,
the person who leads the farmers' movement with Ben to protest against the company.
-Take care! -Take care!
-Go check that area! -Okay!
Encek and Gele must be asleep now.
Come.
We're so lucky tonight.
Come on, Musang.
Okay.
We'll split up.
Four that way and four this way.
Now! Be careful!
-Come on! -Which one is it, Ben?
This is the one.
You two get the cars. I'll take care of this.
-Now. -Now.
Fuck! No key!
Seriously?
-What are you doing? -Looking for wires.
Why would you do that? You've watched too many movies.
This!
Hurry up!
Come on!
Come on.
Hurry up! Get in!
-Hurry up! -Come on!
Hurry up, sir!
Ben, move!
They escaped! Hey!
What's happening?
Get down!
Get down! Down!
Get down!
What happened?
Is everything okay?
-Jody is not here! -What?
He's still in the camp!
Can anybody drive?
-Me! -Take over! Excuse me, sir.
Fuck!
This kid is acting tough!
Eat this, shithead!
Fuck!
City boy…
Can you shoot?
Pull the trigger!
Shoot me!
Shoot me.
Shoot me! Shoot!
Shoot me!
This is how you do it.
I didn't expect this…
I'm sick of fighting for nothing.
It's better to be their ally.
You shot my brother.
You two have caused so many problems!
Hasan!
Mr. Hasan!
Ben!
Ben! Ben, wake up!
Jago, the key is in the car!
Come on! We have to go!
Come on!
Come on, Jago!
-Bro… -Where are they?
-Get them! Get them, dimwit! -Hey!
Hasan!
Hasan…
Ben, hang on…
Jago, they're after us!
Stop, you fuckers!
Jago! Faster, Jago! Faster!
Hurry!
Stop, you fuckers!
Hurry! Jago, faster!
Come on!
Jerks! Stop!
Stop!
Move away!
Fuck!
Shoot them!
Get down!
Watch out!
Musang, watch out!
-Fuck! -You fuckers!
Shit!
Come on, Jago!
Ben, just a little more…
Just a little more.
-Ben. Stay awake. -Just wait a little longer, Ben!
-Beni! -It's cold.
-Ben. Stay with me. -Jago, faster!
Beni! Stay with me!
Beni! Stay with me, Ben!
-Ben! -Just a little more…
Beni! Stay with me… Fuck!
Jago!
Stay with me, Ben! Ben.
Don't think about the end of this road
Stay with me, you fucker.
-Ben, come on! -Jago!
Jago, faster!
Just a little more.
Hang on! Jago!
Don't think about the end of this road
Don't think about…
Sing with me, Ben!
Just sing, you fucker!
Don't think about the end of this road
Don't think about the end of this road
Hold on, Ben! Wait a little longer!
Don't think about the end of this road
Follow me, Ben.
-Ben… -Don't think
About the end of this road
We're free
We're free
Just a little longer, Ben.
THEN THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN."
Hey?
What?
Ever wondered why reggae songs always start with a drumroll?
You serious? You wanna talk about that now?
You don't wanna know?
Spill, if you're bursting to tell me.
The drumroll is the sound of the cannons bringing down the walls of Babylon.
What's Babylon?
Babylon is a city putrid with capitalism and corruption.
Capitalists, don't worry. I'll take care of them.
What's he doing?
Look at that son of a bitch. Go on.
Shit!
GOLD BRICK
BREUIL & SONS NUMBER ONE IN CHARTRES
My name is Daniel Sauveur.
I was born in Chartres. Central France.
In the middle of nowhere.
My mom had one dream.
To have a view of the cathedral.
Even though it was from a distance, Dad gave it to her before leaving us.
The Breuils took that too.
The Breuils are the most loaded family in town.
From father to son.
There are Breuils in your town too.
The ones who crush you with the heel of their shoes.
They don't even mean to do it, those idiots.
I learned that if you want a nice view, there's no choice.
You have to hustle to get to the top. Especially on top of the Breuils.
So I began to watch them to understand how they got there.
-You know what? -Hi.
There's nothing to understand.
-Thinking of you. -Thanks.
Some people are born with, and some without. That's it.
Your mother is waiting for you.
In Chartres, there's Breuil & Sons,
and way further down, there's everyone else.
Every Wednesday, Breuil Sr. ate at this place with his son, Patrick.
The little one there.
He probably doesn't know it, but we went to the same elementary school.
-Two coffees for table four. -I only have two hands!
This is Unc.
I have the veal!
-My father's best friend. -Go!
He looked after us after he died.
-You seen the kid? -No.
Every Wednesday, I spent the day with him here, at the Beaux Arts,
the Michelin-starred restaurant.
-I told you to stay in the kitchen. -Look, Unc.
Look at the woman, table 25.
Mrs. Breuil?
You see her bag? She's left it behind two Wednesdays in a row.
-So what? -I have a plan.
Mrs. Breuil! You forgot your bag, madam.
Thanks, that's kind. For you.
Mom.
Here.
When you're from Chartres, you learn it early on.
The Breuils always win.
There was a time when people started naming their kids after their favorite brands.
That's how my best friend found himself with the name Scania.
Like the trucks.
He hated the Breuils too.
His dad worked as a trucker for them, so he never got to see him.
When I lost my father,
some kids at school started calling me "bastard."
And Scania made them pay every time.
So I share everything with him.
Fifty-fifty.
Hey, see you.
When we got older,
we swore never to work for the Breuils like our fathers had.
We set up our own business.
It wasn't dumb. It worked.
All right, Coz?
Except that here, all roads lead to…
Breuil & Sons of bitches.
Like everyone else, we ended up working for the Breuils.
Way too much.
Over 90% of your turnover comes from us.
Economic dependence. Sorry. I don't make the rules.
Hey, give me that!
Economic dependence is when you do too much business with one client.
-Apparently, that's not good. -Let go!
Stop.
Get lost!
Because we didn't have any other clients and owed money to the bank,
we were done for.
We had no choice.
Scania had to take a job as a driver for Breuil.
I held out another three months, but a man's gotta eat, right?
What the hell are you doing? Smoke break's over. Give me that.
That's him.
Is that him?
Daniel Sauveur, sir.
-Save the formality. Call me "boss." -Boss.
Have you told your buddy how things work?
How things work?
Let me explain. I have free rein over who I hire and fire around here.
I'll give you a short-term contract for six months.
At the end of that, Breuil Sr. will pay you a 10% indemnity, 900 euros.
That's it? 900 euros and no trade-offs?
It's the law, but don't get excited.
You're going to give me that bonus in cash.
-50% now, 50% at the end of the contract. -What?
Otherwise, I'll fire you during your trial period.
Pay up and I'll keep you on.
Same thing, 50 at the end, 50 when you start.
But I don't have 450 euros right now. I've got nothing.
Your buddy said he'd take care of it.
Thanks.
-Why are you giving money to that wimp? -This way, you have a job.
And that's how, after taking over the whole town, the Breuils got me too.
The locals see working here as a step-up.
They reckon they're doing something high-end.
The global distribution of Parisian luxury.
The quintessence of the French psyche.
Givenchy, Dior, Saint Laurent.
The whole shebang. Anyway, you get the picture.
In reality, those luxury brands send their perfume to Breuil in cubes,
and we put them in bottles, boxes, cardboard boxes, and pallets.
Then we deliver them to big clients across the world.
I started out in quality control for Colin Brown.
It's a big American luxury brand.
You know? The black and white ads with guys and chicks in jeans.
I've seen it all come through.
CB Gold, of course.
CB X-treme, when techno was back on the club scene.
CB Green for the eco-friendly crowd.
I even saw CB Red when guys wanted to smell nice to work out.
You think I'm kidding? I'm not.
Excuse me?
What's going on here?
The old guy croaked.
Breuil?
Let's just say that if there was one less Breuil in the world, I was in.
But don't forget, the Breuils always win.
At my age, having done nothing to deserve it,
little Patrick became the big boss.
His future was all mapped out, while I didn't have one.
Even so, that's when everything changed for me.
Hello. Béatrice Breuil, Patrick's wife.
A gift to celebrate his taking over as head of the company.
A Bois d'Argent fragrance.
-Hello. -Hi.
-A little gift from our family. -Thanks.
What about you, Daniel?
How's it going with the perfumers? Is the son any better than the father?
Not sure.
They're really taking it out of you.
Yeah. They wear us out.
Guess what your mom and I heard on the local news last night?
A few liters of perfume concentrate can go for the same price as a kilo of gold.
Fuck. At that price, you'd better smell good.
A bit of water with some kind of dumb flower juice… 30,000 smackers.
Those guys think they're so fancy.
YOUR SALE PRICE - 50 €
INTERESTED IN THE COLIN BROWN!
Scania, I've been watching them for days, I'm telling you.
There's only one time when the boxes don't ring at the gate.
There's piles of money to be made.
Enough with that bullshit.
I sold one bottle online. I made 50 euros in one second.
Why would we miss out on a gold mine like that?
Tell me. What do we have to lose here? I'm doing it, so do it.
What are you doing about Kowalski?
That Polack's the one who's gonna let us into the chicken coop.
-I know how to handle him. -You're killing me.
I'm throwing pearls before swine with you.
Evening, Patrick.
Jacques-Yves. I'm pleased you could come.
He'd have been touched.
You should be proud. Armand was a front-runner to the end.
Thanks, Jacques-Yves.
None of that between us, now that we'll be seeing more of each other.
-How so? -I'll swing by from time to time.
To see that our products are still getting the same treatment.
I'd like to introduce you to Béatrice.
Béa.
My wife, Béatrice. Jacques-Yves Rousseau from Colin Brown.
Nice to meet you.
-My pleasure. -And…
Brice Nougarolis, Parfums VIP.
Yes, the online discounter. We know who you are.
Boss! One of your Polacks ran over one of my boxes with his Fenwick.
-Polack? -Yeah.
Hold on.
-"One of my Polacks"? -Yeah.
You know what, Sauveur?
From now on, it won't be my Polacks taking care of the trash.
It's going to be you, my little French helper.
You can start right now. Get rid of this.
As David Douillet would say, stupidity is like judo.
Dick.
You need to use your opponent's strength.
-Sauveur? -Yeah.
He's a dick, boss.
Hello. I'm going to the incinerator.
-Go ahead. -Thanks.
Take people who work in offices.
They take pens home for their kids to have something to draw with.
You don't have a problem with that, right?
Scania and I work in perfume, and we don't have kids.
Same thing.
In six months, we made 10,000 smackers each by selling online.
I was able to help out Unc and Mom. And Scania bought me a rollie.
Enjoying life?
Hey!
Go fuck yourself.
May I buy you a drink?
Yeah? Hey! A couple of mojitos!
-Two? Got it. -Thanks.
I'm a regular here.
How come I've never seen that lovely face before?
I just moved back to Chartres.
Yeah?
People usually tend to leave.
What brought you back?
-Work. -Perfume?
Like everyone.
-Like me. -Oh yeah?
-Yeah. -For whom?
For whom? For myself. I launched a small start-up.
I'm selling luxury brands at a discount.
For now. Down the line, who knows.
Growth is good for now. Exponential, you could say.
At the beginning, we were more into B2B licensing,
wanting to move into B2C, so we went with the US straightaway.
Then we thought, in the medium term, why not totally flood the metaverse,
directly on the Internet, too,
in the peripheral, secondary universes.
And so now we're trying to…
You've got to take a break, too, you know. We're having a few parties with friends.
To blow off some steam, you know.
Because we've just taken three million, me and my friend over there.
He's a mediocre dancer,
but he's bought himself a nice little shack for 1.5 million
on the Opal Coast.
He bought it with cash, just like that.
And there's a whole group of us in the incubator.
Kind of like modern-day "golden boys," without the guns.
We said to ourselves, "We might go crazy."
That's the risk, so we'd better not. So, what do you think?
-What do you think? -About?
How about we go for dinner at the Beaux Arts? Monday at 8:00 p.m.?
No.
-8:30? -Thanks.
8:30? A little later?
Hey!
Amigo, is that a Rorolove you have there? Let me see.
My mother gave it to me for my birthday.
-Give it or you're out. -No, boss.
Your contract is up for renewal. You're two days late. My 500 smackers?
I'll pay you tomorrow.
I don't do credit.
There you go. Perfect.
I wouldn't have wanted to put someone else on trash duty.
Trash really suits you.
Go on, move it.
Son of a bitch.
COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS
What?
USERS HAVE REPORTED THE SALE OF COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS
Bastards.
Daniel?
Fuck.
Daniel?
Yeah?
-Come down! -Yeah!
Lt. Fayard, national police. We were called in by the customs service.
Customs?
You must be mistaken. I've never crossed a border in my life.
I think you must have the wrong address.
Do you have a computer?
No.
What's your job, Daniel?
I work on the Breuil assembly line.
Breuil?
Doesn't mean a thing. The whole town works in perfume, so it's not…
Who mentioned perfume?
You asked whether I worked for Breuil. We make perfume, so I said "perfume."
Does lebonplan.fr mean anything to you?
Is that why you're… Okay. So, it's very…
So Breuil Jr. took over the company.
His wife, very kindly, gave a bottle to all the employees.
And because I don't use that scent,
I thought I'd sell it online.
So I sold it for 50 euros.
It's true that I told my friends about it.
And so everyone wanted me to sell theirs.
But it was really temporary.
I mean, I wasn't planning to have a business, you know.
That might be why you saw multiple sales.
-Online? -Online, yeah.
Without a computer?
Without… Yeah. Someone lent one to me just for that.
-We've never had one. -Yeah.
Actually, it'd be useful to get one to buy stuff.
Fencing counterfeit goods gets you five years.
And a 375,000 euro fine.
I'll stay in line.
I can't call you. The cops put a tap on my phone.
What are you talking about?
They searched the house.
They know about the Internet deal. It's over.
What do I do with the 200 bottles I have?
I don't know. I'll figure it out.
We need to make some money. I need to leave Mom's place.
I'm not going to get her involved in our mess.
It's Kowalski.
Go.
Come in.
I don't have you on my calendar, Mr. Sauveur.
You know my name? Did you look for it?
I'm the head of HR. Really? Right.
-Take a seat. -Yes, thanks.
Weird that we haven't run into each other in the halls before.
So, where were you before?
I was with Breuil in the Paris office.
Then Mr. Breuil called me in as general manager.
Right, GM, okay.
-Congratulations. -Thanks.
Did you end up going with that other guy?
-Let's not discuss that. -No?
-No. -No.
Anything else?
No, I just came to set things straight.
No need.
Just for me, just to tell you that this whole Internet thing…
I'd been drinking, so I was talking nonsense.
I don't even own a computer, so it's…
It didn't make any sense. It was totally ridiculous.
So I wanted to apologize.
Drinking makes people exaggerate.
-Do you see… -Not really.
I have a meeting in five minutes. You've set things straight, so that's it.
We'll have an opportunity to discuss your personal development.
Got it, madam.
Just one last little thing.
About the dinner, are we still on?
No.
-No? -No.
-I don't mix business and personal. -Is it because I'm a warehouse worker?
I never said that.
It's just a bit hurtful. But, hey, you get used to it.
-I'll pick you up at 8:00 p.m., babe? -What are you doing?
-Have dinner with me. -Are you crazy?
A quick meal. What's the harm?
We'll see, but not here.
-We'll see? -Get out.
-"We'll see" means "we'll see." -Leave.
You didn't eat them last time. They got left in the fridge.
Hello.
Ladies and gents, all the Apple products!
iPhone, iPad, all the best Apple packages, get them here!
We've got luxury watches and glasses, sir!
Thirty euros. It's not expensive. They're quality.
It's French. A luxury product.
The latest iPhone, get it here!
-For 350 euros, it's yours, my friend. -Is it real, at least?
It's 350 euros.
I only have 300.
Give me the 300. That's great. All right.
Have a good day. It's not expensive!
Sir, this is the real thing.
All the Apple products!
-I'm going to the truck. -iPad! iPhone!
Get them here! Sir, anything you like?
-Trying to screw us over? -Not the teeth!
-Who are you, you little bastard? -Stop! Stop!
Tell me when it's 30. You tell me when to start counting!
The asshole's getting away!
Guys, stop! I have 200 perfumes worth 100 euros!
Sell them for 50. You'll make 5,000 in a weekend!
You think I believe you?
They're luxury products, guys! Colin Brown, come on!
-Why didn't you say? -Why didn't you talk to us at the stall?
-I didn't dare. -Come on, get up. What nonsense.
That's how I replaced the Internet with Titou and Raoul.
You have to admit, there's nothing better than buying local.
Right.
Let's say 50% at the end of every month.
Boss, it's our first time doing this.
-First time. -Yes.
You take 15 units ten times a week.
600 units per month at 60 euros apiece.
That means my cut is 18,000.
We don't sell for 60 euros a unit, boss.
You're a real asshole, Sauveur.
Right?
What are you doing?
Tomorrow.
Fuck, tomorrow.
Don't worry.
-Who is this? -It's us.
He's coming out for the money.
Come in. Not outside.
I didn't think losers like you were the type to save.
-Asshole. -Come here!
Hold on! Daniel!
Relax! Stop.
Damn it, it's broken.
-I'm going to send you to jail. -Shut up.
Scania's cousin works for Social Security.
He loved your short-term contract deal. Here, call him.
-Yes. -We'll explain it all to him.
You're going to tell him that it's not right.
-Here. -Okay, I get it.
-You got it? -Yes.
Here's a six-month disability claim. I'll take this back.
It was mine. Let's not argue over it.
There.
You keep your mouth shut. We'll keep business running, okay?
Jesus.
In the time it took Breuil to replace Kowalski, we had an open playing field.
We increased our numbers
to the point that my guys at the market…
Get a Kangoo! What's this thing?
…they struggled to keep up.
As for me, I finally got to leave my mom's place
and rent my own house in Croix-Bonnard
where the Cosmetic Valley executives live.
Do you like it, Mr. Sauveur? The appliances are new.
-Is it all in good order? -Everything is perfect.
-Perfect. -Is the file okay?
-Great. -Enjoy your well-deserved holiday.
You'll be comfy here, right?
To Breuil.
So, with this robotic inventory system,
robots scan all the boxes but not their contents?
That's right, Miss Van Stratten.
Some of the products won't be monitored. 1.1% across the entire stock.
-Marginal. -Marginal?
1.1% is a lot of products with the massive numbers we handle.
If we want to stay in the race,
or even, let's go crazy,
if we want to win this race, we have to move more products more quickly.
So I'm the only one here who sees
that 1.1% of the 4.5 million perfumes we handle a year
represents over 2 million euros worth of perfume that's unmonitored.
Or you're the only one who doesn't see that we're monitoring 200 million euros.
Stéphane is right. Innovation has always been part of the company's DNA.
It's a green light from me. Thank you, everyone.
Thanks, Patrick.
Are you getting settled?
I gave the green light to a project to digitalize the inventory.
It should allow us to grow.
But, yeah…
I've wanted to ask you something, but I was waiting for…
For what?
I've always known that you weren't made for taking over Breuil.
That your father was pushing it a bit.
What's your question?
The other day at the Beaux Arts, Brice Nougarolis put an idea in my head.
Nougarolis?
What the hell was he doing there?
He's a perfume discounter. Everything Dad hated.
The biggest online retailer in Europe.
-You want me to go online. Is that it? -I'm being serious.
So what, then?
He said that he'd give everything to be in your shoes,
at the helm of a big cruise liner, something stupid like that.
I'm not following. What's this about?
I think Nougarolis would buy Breuil.
Dad and Grandad's company?
Your father is dead. Your grandad for even longer.
You want to sell and then do what?
Whatever we want.
Your dad always got in the way of your plans.
But that's over now. So sell.
Don't you see? This is what we need.
A fresh start.
You mean the three of us?
Are you talking about kids?
-Everything is copied there? -Right.
-Hello, Sauveur. -Hi.
-How are you? -What's going on here?
I have some good news.
Your job is going to be taken over by a foolproof scanner
that won't get tired of watching the products.
I don't get tired. I'm fulfilled.
I said it at the last meeting. I don't want to change roles.
It's always the same with your lot. You complain before you understand.
Kowalski is on disability.
So you'll get the assistant role.
You'll support Lablonde, who will replace him in stock management.
You're getting promoted.
I don't want it. HR didn't even warn me. Is this mandatory?
It was agreed at the top.
-Breuil? -Yes, Patrick.
-Fucking Breuil. -What did you say?
The French economy has created over 100,000 jobs. Good news.
-Where are you going? -To the incinerator. The dumpster's full.
Sit down.
Why?
You're the assistant, Sauveur. The trash is for the warehouse workers.
I'm not gonna wait for a bedsore from sitting on my ass.
-I don't mind helping out a bit. -Well, I do mind.
-Do you know about collective agreements? -Yeah.
It's not just your right to sit on your ass. It's your duty.
You know how many guys have seen the wrong end of a cop's baton
just for your ass?
Don't mess things up for us, okay?
Sit down!
…there's also an issue with a fear of recruiting…
I left my life behind to go to Paris for training
because you asked me to.
You bring me back, then give the job you promised me to a moron.
Stéphane isn't a moron.
He has qualifications.
Five years at private-sales.com.
Working with him is a way for you to increase your skill set.
-Increase my skill set? -Virginie.
It's a management decision.
You want to talk about management?
I'm going to ask you a question that I was given during the training.
Focus.
In your company, who do you fire first?
The smart person who works hard, the smart person who doesn't,
the idiot who works hard, or the idiot who doesn't?
It's the idiot who works hard. He does the most damage.
Now, imagine that in this company,
the idiot's the person with all the power.
Are we talking about Stéphane?
Sauveur, where are you going?
Fuck, how do they do it?
TONIGHT?
PACKAGING AWARDS BREUIL & SONS
That's her, with Gégé.
Your sweetheart is drunk as a skunk.
Don't say that when you come over.
Okay, you got it? You got the champagne?
I'm heading over.
Good evening.
Evening.
You couldn't resist.
Coming here.
How are you?
I'm great.
He appointed a business school graduate. A business school graduate?
I didn't see it coming. I'm so dumb. Even though I did everything right.
I believe people when they make promises, but people don't care about promises.
And then you're the fool. Like me.
I don't really understand. It's confusing. What's your point? I don't get it.
I told you Breuil made me come back for the role of general manager.
-Yes, right. -There you go.
Well, Breuil decided to give the general manager role to someone else.
Right. Because what's Breuil? He's an asshole.
The Breuils are bastards.
-No, okay. -I'm really…
Please, let's talk outside.
I'm sorry.
That wasn't exactly a great first date.
Second.
The first wasn't a raging success either.
What?
Wanna get your revenge on the Breuils?
I wouldn't know how.
But if you could?
Honestly?
Yes.
Can I kiss you?
What's the connection?
The connection is that I'm about to take a big risk for you.
I told her everything. Don't ask me why. I just knew I had to.
A champion's instinct.
Wait, just…
Those barcode readers that scan the boxes?
How do they scan the bottles that are inside them?
The robots scan the container.
-What's the container? -Well, the boxes.
They don't count the bottles? That's dumb.
It's dumb, but it's fast. That's all Breuil cares about.
This is a pallet of 27 boxes.
Listen.
When we prepare an order, we take a whole box,
or we pick stuff out of a box at the top of the pallet.
Since we only scan the box, the system tolerates a margin of error.
It doesn't know how many bottles there are.
That margin of error is 1.1%
There. Listen to this. It's genius.
If we take less than 1.1% of the entire stock,
the system won't register an error and won't set off a warning.
And 1.1% equals millions, just waiting for us to take.
2.5 million, to be precise, which is 50,000 bottles.
-We can't take 50,000 bottles. -Why not?
50,000 bottles. That's actual theft, son.
50,000 bottles is nothing to Breuil.
We won't get caught. Give me the notepad.
We just need to find ten people. Build a team.
Ten people? How? I'm your only friend in the place.
To bring people into this, you need to know them a bit.
Scania, Virginie's job is to recruit people.
It's not her job to recruit people to steal from their boss.
Would lots of people refuse an extra month's salary
handed to them on a platter?
An extra salary every month.
Remember that our dream was always to make the Breuils pay.
With this, they'll lose 2.5 million euros.
It'd be criminal not to take them for every last cent.
Okay, maybe.
We need to convince ten people.
-Okay, that's good. -Yeah.
They're good. We can trust them.
We're not taking him. We're not taking Lablonde.
There's no way.
We have to take him.
Virginie taught me something.
Out of the 26 million workers in France, 800,000 are Buddhists.
That's nothing, right?
No one has ever heard of Buddhists.
Well, actually, there are twice as many of them
as the 400,000 union workers who bust our balls all year round,
which tells you what a nuisance they could be.
If the Breuil union had the bad idea of hitting us with a week-long strike,
we'd get nothing out and lose even more dough than Breuil.
She was right. We needed Lablonde. He was the union rep at the company.
Like they say in Japan, "Rain falls harder on a leaky roof."
So my business had to run like clockwork.
I found that the trick was to slip a duplicate of a big order
into the pile of orders to be prepared.
That one there.
If we were caught, it could be blamed on a small printing error.
Could happen to anyone.
Mr. Lablonde!
We had to have guys at every step of the pallet being processed.
First, Lablonde decides which team prepares what order.
That's Annie Boss, supervisor.
She makes sure the list gets into the right hands.
Franck Schumi, the Schumacher of forklift drivers.
I timed each of them ten times. He's the fastest.
He's in charge of lowering the top pallets,
the ones we never dip into.
There. You see how everything is automated.
With our friends.
The Seko twins.
Fabrice and Fabien. Known for their flexibility.
Their job is to take stuff from the bottom of the pallet
to delay, for as long as possible,
the discovery that products are missing from the stock.
It's very easy for the surveillance team to notice
if two identical big orders are being prepared at the same time.
It never happens, so that'd sound the alarm.
It's difficult to buy the security guards.
A private company changes them each week.
But watch Yasmina and Déborah.
Yasmina goes down the list of products from A to Z.
Déborah goes up the list from Z to A.
The guys on video don't get it.
Me neither. That must mean it's working.
See the A4 sheet that Mickaël is slipping between two boxes there?
Truckers and dockers aren't allowed inside the warehouse.
We use that sign
to follow the pallet that needs to be diverted after the gate.
Okay, let's watch.
Watch.
It's going to turn now. There.
-All done. -There you go.
There it is. 27 boxes of 72 bottles. I'll let you do the math.
-Lablonde validates the dispatch. -Okay.
Mourad, our docker, just has to divert it to the right truck.
I'll take that one in.
And our driver,
you already know him.
If you're no math wizard, we lifted two pallets of 1,944 bottles a week.
we lifted two pallets of 1,944 bottles a week.
On the market, that's 388,000 in cash every month.
Wanna come by tonight?
I'm not good at meeting people.
Isn't that the essence of your job?
It's not the same thing.
What? You can't handle it?
-Don't push, Sauveur. -What?
I'm in as deep as you are. I'm just cautious.
-We don't know where all this will lead. -We do.
We're going to rip two million off Breuil Jr.
I'm not talking about that. After.
After…
After that, we'll take our money. We'll leave this town, and we'll see.
You know nothing about me.
I know enough.
You think I'd leave it all behind for a warehouse worker?
Yes.
No?
Yes.
Okay.
They'll be waiting for me.
If by chance you want to set up a business like mine,
just a word of advice. Take space into account.
I can guarantee that two pallets per week take up a whole lot of space.
And one last thing. Make sure to keep an eye on your team.
Don't forget. The worst rich person is the one who used to be poor.
From the first payday, every team member opened the bullshit floodgates.
And I mean big-time.
Schumi wanted to have cooking lessons with the chef at Beaux Arts.
Hi, Daniel.
A Michelin-star chef charges 300 smackers an hour.
Have you heard about cryptocurrency? It's billions, Schumi.
Gotta get those assholes.
As for Lablonde, the pinko of cosmetics,
his vice was horse racing bets.
You good, Daniel? Please don't give me all 200 euro bills this time. Okay?
That fool blew all his money at the bookies
on tips sent his way by his union buddies.
They don't like it at the coffee shop.
And every night, Mickaël bought rounds at the Pharaoh with his dear cousin Yoni
who came up with the brilliant idea of showing up at Breuil in a brand-new Audi.
They're friends. They're leaving in five minutes.
There was one thing that made me lose my shit.
I won't post them.
Yasmina and Déborah's stories about their shopping spree on Avenue Montaigne.
This time, I decided to take things in hand and buy my neighbor's house.
Here's Santa Claus. I need some dough.
Refuel coming up. One sec.
They could blow as much as they wanted. Nothing was leaving this place.
Why would they buy all that shit?
Bunch of fools.
Every Friday, Scania and I paid everyone.
So, how full is that thing? Those idiots are costing me.
-And every Friday, it'd get messy. -Close it.
Come on! Give me mine!
This is great!
Fifty euros, ladies and gentlemen!
Because she's lovely.
Good, thanks.
-Both? -Both.
Not interested?
Both for 50 euros.
Quality perfume at a low price! Fifty euros!
No, there! Damn it! Every time!
Two for forty euros. Okay, give it to me.
Cheers.
Hello?
We do what we can, Daniel.
But you're pushing too much. We can't take it.
Tuesday, Moulins. Wednesday, Mâcon.
Thursday, Montbéliard. Friday, Montargis. Saturday, Montviers.
What do we do, bro?
You've done the towns starting with M. Do the cities starting with N!
We were reaching our limit. But that didn't bother anyone.
They only cared about their Friday night fiesta.
There was only one thing on my mind. Finding a way to grow bigger and bigger.
You know what? It was handed to me.
Jesus.
The magical child.
Jesus was Yasmina's half brother, and his guilty pleasure was orgies.
During his adventures,
he'd made friends with two directors of the Bergamini store,
the Italian Sephora that just came to France.
…in cash, every month.
He even talked them into doing business with me.
So we had to have structure.
The first problem I had was storage.
Whenever I have a problem, Scania has a cousin.
-How are you? -Hi.
He was a dairy farmer and broke as they come.
You good?
He'd had enough of eating what he could hunt,
so he jumped at the chance to rent out his barn.
-So? -Perfect.
Other than Scania and I, no one knew where the stock was.
It was better that way.
All we needed was our own truck to deliver to Bergamini, so I broke my piggy bank.
It's the least expensive one. Come.
Shut up!
With my small company, I sold all my stock to Bergamini like any other local company.
I sold them 20% cheaper than Breuil.
Apparently, Tapie said, "The first million is the hardest."
Well, I can tell you, not for us.
Drink!
The real France of tax-free overtime. That was us.
I mean, who would want something like that to end?
Béa?
Béa.
What?
-We have a huge problem. -What's wrong?
After signing the agreement in principle with Nougarolis…
I called you, remember?
-It's me. -So?
They just left.
Is it fully signed?
Just a few formalities. Accounts audit, stock inventory by his auditors.
The sale will be complete in a month's time.
And? It was all going well. What happened after that?
Once I had left, I heard a loud noise from the warehouse.
What noise?
We had a metal sheet come off the roof a few months back.
Yes, you mentioned there were leaks.
Leaks in the warehouse.
So with all that water, he wanted to go take a look.
And he found them.
He opened 20 boxes at random. All empty.
Why didn't you call the cops right away?
Well, Béa, because I'd just signed a binding agreement with Nougarolis.
If he hears about all this before I find the missing stock,
we're fucked.
You know what that means?
After the stock inventory, I'll be able to buy Breuil at half price.
Empty shelves sell at a lot less than full shelves, even if it's perfume.
What do you think?
I get myself a job at Breuil as an ex-con reentering the job market.
That always attracts the thugs. I identify the thieves. I infiltrate them.
I report back on the missing stock.
Nothing complicated.
Great.
You won't reveal your source? It's your business.
But did they give you any details that might have drawn your attention?
Bearing in mind your deadline, it could save us time.
There is something, now that I think about it.
Two, three weeks ago, Patrick came home all upset
because an employee took his spot in the parking lot.
It wasn't the poor guy's fault.
I took down the "Reserved for Armand Breuil" sign when he died.
-Two minutes. I'll get him. -Well…
"Two minutes…" You mean, one minute.
The odd thing is that it was a young warehouse worker with a luxury car.
An Audi TT, I think.
Sorry, boss. There's no sign, so I thought…
-I didn't want it to get scratched. -Yes.
An Audi TT.
That's more than enough.
On the face of it, we should get this done in under a week.
That's what I wanted to hear.
From now on, call me Ange.
-You good? Yeah. -All right?
-What are you eating? -Where have you been, looking like a mess?
Daniel's been looking for you.
Are you listening to me?
You can't just show up here at lunchtime every day.
Daniel's going to replace you. You hear, Yoni?
Screw Daniel.
Yeah?
Hey. You're screwing all of us.
Because of you, we couldn't get it out today.
We'll only get half our money on Friday. What's your excuse?
I'm in love.
-I'm going, or I'll punch him. -It's no big deal.
You dumb or what?
What's your dad's problem? He gets on my nerves.
-Did you hear what you said to him? -It's 8:00 a.m.
"8:00 a.m."? It's noon.
Have the clocks changed?
-Who's the girl? -The girl from the checkroom.
-At Pharaoh's? -Yeah.
-Isn't that the bouncer's girl? -Not between 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.
-He's going to destroy you. -I can handle myself.
I'd like to see that.
-She's hot though. -Don't talk about my girl. It's serious.
-You bastard! -Bruce!
-It wasn't me! -Leave him!
-Hey, what are you doing? -Bruce, let him go!
You piece of shit! Asshole!
-Don't kill me! -Stop!
-Hey! Let me go! -Stop!
-Stop! I'm begging you! Bruce! -Let me go, asshole!
Fuck. What is that ex-con doing there?
Hey!
What are you doing?
I don't know, boss. I was told to fill--
You weren't told anything. Go see Lablonde.
He'll move you. Get this done.
What's with your cousin? He's ditched me twice this week.
It's serious this time. He's in the hospital.
-Two months on disability. -No way. What did you do?
We went out to the Pharaoh. He got beaten up by some guy.
You messing with me? Do you know what's at stake?
-I know. I'm sorry, but-- -Shut up.
We have a pallet to get out. How are you going to manage on your own?
-I don't know. -Yeah, well…
Tell Yoni to stay tucked in bed.
-He's fired. You tell him. -Daniel…
Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second?
Tell me. What were you in prison for?
-Armored vehicle. -Armored vehicle?
Okay. Were you armed?
-It's easier than using bare hands. -Right.
Did you shoot?
AK47, it's enough to just show it.
And how many years did you get?
Eight. Four on probation.
You snitched?
Good behavior.
Would you like to make an easy 500 smackers?
-Forget it. I'm not interested. -I mean it. No risk. It's really clean.
You'll have your 500 smackers at 2:00 p.m. It's fine.
You interested?
Go see Mickaël over there, next to the wrapper. He'll explain.
That's what you came up with?
-To hire an ex-con. -You could've discussed it with us.
As long as he does the job, I'm fine. Is he doing the job, Mickaël?
He's doing good.
Fine, but what if he tries to look good and tells his PO?
-His what? -His PO.
Probation officer. What if he turns us in?
Actually, he's involved now. He has more to lose than we do.
If there's an issue, he'll get sent back to jail. No risk for us.
That's all nice, but how are you going to pay him?
He's getting Yoni's share. After that, we'll see.
That's not right.
Not right? Weren't you in charge of your nephew?
Hold on. You're paying him as much as us? Seniority doesn't count?
You're constantly plugged into the news. It's frying your brain.
Is this the negotiating table at an industrial relations meeting?
Listen. That ex-con is a risk that involves all of us.
-True. -Right.
I say we take a vote. I vote against.
-Same. -There's been a misunderstanding. No vote.
Okay? So you schedule him with Mickaël, and that's it.
Save your saliva for your wife.
What I'm about to tell you is extremely serious.
I found out we're being robbed.
-Here? -Products. A lot of them.
It's probably happening as we speak.
No way. We have the best security system in the valley.
There's no doubt about it.
It has to be one of our employees. No one knows them better than you.
I want you to analyze the HR database to look for suspect profiles.
-Even old employees. -Of course.
I promise that if we get through this together,
this time, I won't forget you.
-In a nutshell? -He knows everything.
No. He asked you to find out. That's not the same at all.
Semantics. He won't let it go.
Breuil Jr. won't let anything go?
You're laughing, but I see him every day.
-Yeah. -So, what do I tell him?
You know it can't be traced.
Every pallet we take goes through the normal workflow.
So, if at any point there's an error,
it's an order that was duplicated, and that's all.
An error. You just need to rationalize it.
-Rationalize? -Yeah.
But we're in deep shit with Breuil! Do you get that?
Aren't you being overdramatic?
It's a matter of time before he finds out everything.
We're lucky enough to have a heads-up. Shouldn't we cool things down?
Not yet.
What I found out last night is big. Very big.
Give me names and addresses.
I've got a good lead, but I need more time before I can give you a full report.
Didn't we say under a week?
I haven't found the stock yet.
I'm not saying we won't, but this isn't a small team.
That's your problem. Mine is to get my money's worth.
Mr. Nougarolis, I don't earn my living with my fees, but with the bonus I get.
The tally is at 5,000 a week. That bonus thing isn't funny.
If you prefer, we can call it a day.
You wanna play it like that? With me?
You're not very smart for a sleuth.
You tell me people are stealing? That the audit will confirm it?
That's enough for me to make Breuil bleed. I don't need your shitty report.
You know what we're going to do? Let's call it a day.
I'll work things out with my contact. We're done.
That's how it is?
Yes, that's how it is.
I'm not following.
You wanted to move fast. Now you want to put the sale off for six months?
You're going to shed staff when you merge Breuil & Sons with Nougarolis.
These people have worked for us forever.
I'd like to find new jobs for as many people as possible.
One less job for you.
Redundancy schemes are always a drag.
You know that one?
Who would you fire first?
-The smart guy who works-- -The idiot who works hard.
I need six months.
Espresso?
You know, since I was a kid, I've picked up on people's energy.
It's a kind of gift that I was given.
I see a lot of suffering in you. Too much emotion.
You need to free yourself from that as soon as possible.
So we're not changing the deal.
KP2M will come take a stock inventory by the end of the month,
and we will close the sale as agreed.
Breuil's freaking out. He's increasing security.
It's all you ever talk about.
Of course. There are ten security guards arriving next week.
We'll adapt. What's the big deal?
Are you dumb? Breuil knows how much was stolen.
If there's one snitch, you'll all go to prison.
Did you say "you"? -What do you mean? -Why didn't you say "we"?
-What do you mean? -Why didn't you say "we"? -You made a deal with Breuil? -Stop right there.
-You made a deal with Breuil? -Stop right there.
You should tell them.
They'll freak out over nothing. Leave them out of my business.
-Your business? -Yeah.
You're not doing business, Daniel.
You're a small-time thief that steals a lot.
I'm not going back to being a pallet-pusher for Breuil.
It's my way out. Maybe it's a bit fun for you--
"Fun"? You have no idea what I've had to do to get here.
For me, it's simple. It stops here. You should do the same.
If not for me, you'd still be selling a few perfumes at the market.
You need to listen.
What do I owe you? Go on, tell me what I owe you.
You're right. You owe me nothing. We don't owe each other anything.
Your letting go says something about the kind of person you are.
You're so desperate to fit in that mold, your business guys have restricted you.
You've forgotten what really matters in life.
What's that? Money?
No, flair.
That fucking idiot.
-Hello? -Mr. Breuil?
I know who's stealing from you.
Mr. Breuil? Are you still there?
Yes.
Like I said, I know who's stealing from you.
I know that you've had a lot go missing.
I also know how that could compromise the sale of your business.
I can help you.
-That's my job. -I need the stock.
I absolutely need to find my stock and put it back.
I'm working on it.
I can get you out of this in good shape if you're willing to pay the price.
Pay 50,000 up front and 50,000 when I deliver the report.
It's not much compared to what's at stake.
Mr. Breuil?
I heard you.
It's essential that you don't talk to anyone about this.
Who am I going to talk to?
OPEN THE RECEIVED FILE
I'm sorry, Mr. Breuil.
Now, listen carefully to what I'm about to say.
I'M SORRY, PLEASE CALL ME VIRGINIE?
Hello?
Breuil knows.
-What? -Is this a joke, Daniel?
-How is that possible? -Fuck, no way.
The good thing is, he doesn't know it's us.
But I hope you've set a little aside because the source has run dry.
-No. -No.
Well, I have a solution for you, but it means going bigger.
What does that mean?
Lablonde, can you confirm
that we have 38 tons going to Sephora Paris Rivoli this weekend?
No, well, I don't know…
-Yes or no? -I don't have the calendar!
Right, okay. I prepared the orders for Mother's Day.
Two of the trucks are loaded up to the max. 40,000 units each.
I suggest we make them disappear.
What?
-What? -That's real theft.
I'm in!
What if they trace it back to us?
They won't trace it back
because they'll think that the trucks were held up by a team of professionals.
What? Who's going to do that? Because--
We are.
-You're mad. -Hold on.
A truck is just a big van, right?
Your specialty, Ange.
The 80,000 units will be in storage before being sold off.
It's worth 2.5 million.
And we'll split it evenly.
We have two days to get ready.
Who's in?
Now we get a vote?
Shut up, you.
Well, 200,000…
-Get down! -Don't shoot!
-I don't want to die! -Shut up!
No! Yes, sir.
No!
Give me your hands. I said shut the fuck up!
-Shut up! -Stop. Hold it.
-Never drop your weapon. -But how do I get the thing on?
Never put down your weapon or you're dead!
Is that clear?
Can I have a go?
What? You?
Really?
-Face down! -Are you mad?
-Hands behind your back. Shut up! -It hurt!
-It's a practice run. -Behind your back! Shut up!
Asshole. Shut up!
There. That's how it's done!
She was holding the zip ties, and she kept the gun on Mourad.
-Okay! Well done. -Well done, Boss!
-Wanna try the truck again? -No, it's fine.
Just one thing, guys.
Don't forget that the second driver won't be in on it. Okay?
Same thing for the gas station staff at Lionville. Okay?
I want us to be believable. They'll eventually be witnesses.
It's planned for Friday night. The Total gas station at Lionville.
-Well done. -Your stock must be close by.
Very good.
Thanks, Jacques-Yves.
Good night.
Same to you.
Sephora Rivoli.
Sephora Rivoli.
Coffee?
Okay, it's Mourad.
Let's go!
Hey!
They're off.
Drop that, damn it!
-I swear I didn't do anything! -Get down!
Get out!
-Get out! -Move!
Get out!
Shut up! Give me your hands!
Don't shoot! I have kids, please!
Shut your mouth!
The door!
Come on!
Let's go!
Where's Ange?
I thought he was with you.
Okay, forget it! Let's go! To the quarry!
-Have you located my stock? -Not yet, but I'm close.
-Where are you? -In one of your trucks.
Thing is, my price has changed. I'm taking too many risks.
No pay without proof.
Another three and we're good.
-Are we on schedule? -We should get going.
It's sad to have to leave two brand-new trucks behind.
-Find yourself a woman, bro. -What's the connection?
-Fuck. -What's wrong?
-I'm not getting through to Boss. -They must be at the quarry.
They'll call us from the road.
UNDELIVERED
Shit!
Where is that dog?
Motherfucker. He used the hedgehog trap, look.
-The dog! -Fuck! Look!
Fuck.
Damn it.
The son of a bitch asked Breuil for 200,000 euros to turn us in.
Monday at 7:45 a.m.,
hair combed to the right, tortoiseshell glasses, and Hermès ties,
Nougarolis's auditors arrived.
Okay. Shall we start?
Étienne, summary.
In line with KP2M protocols,
we cross-checked the data on the company software
with the physical stock inventory.
This was carried out by taking samples from 320 boxes.
-What did that give us in the end? -We get…
Unlike Nougarolis, I was born in Chartres.
And unlike him, I learned this at birth.
The inventory confirms the quantities declared by the seller
at the signing of the agreement in principle.
-Nothing's missing? -It's marginal, sir.
The Breuils always win.
Brice.
You want to know how little Patrick saved his skin?
Remember that night?
-Hello? -Sauveur.
We need to meet. The cathedral. Now.
TO ARMAND BREUIL FROM THE GRATEFUL TOWN OF CHARTRES
You know we went to school together?
-At Jean Moulin. -Doesn't ring a bell.
I remember you well.
What do you want?
I bought some information from your team…
I have your names. Pictures of your house.
…with the hundreds of thousands of euros in cash
which you're giving back to me.
Why didn't you call the police?
Because I'm selling.
When?
We already signed. That's the issue.
There's too much perfume missing for the audit to go the way it needs to go.
I want all the products that you stole to find their way back to my warehouse.
Immediately.
That's going to be tricky. I sold it all.
I'd have preferred to avoid this.
Here's little Patrick's plan B.
To avoid prison,
I had to fill two trucks with an amount equal to the missing stock.
I stole them, as you know. The insurance covered it.
We then replaced the stolen boxes in the inventory.
The auditors wouldn't notice shit,
and Nougarolis, who thought he was going to pay Breuil half,
would have to pay full price.
It's that or the police.
Except that in this story, we did all the work and made shit. As usual.
And for me, that doesn't work anymore. So let's follow my plan instead.
Admire the artist.
Wait, your story isn't clear.
I'll do your robbery.
But only if you tell me everything. Don't hide anything.
My wife.
She talked me into selling. And into selling to Nougarolis.
They are…
close.
So you want to hurt them.
Okay.
I'll do the robbery, but whatever I steal is mine.
You don't get it, Sauveur.
All my products come back to me.
Calm down, man.
Imagine
if people realized that the products prepared by Breuil for Colin Brown
don't contain perfume.
What would happen?
It would be a huge scandal.
We agree that Breuil & Sons can't afford that kind of setback.
It'd be a lot more than a setback.
All our clients would terminate their distribution contracts.
It would finish us.
Us? You mean Nougarolis?
-What is this shit? -It's water.
Nougarolis.
Listen to me, boss.
We'll do the robbery. Then we sabotage the perfume stock.
This is how it'll happen.
The day after the robbery, I'll offload all the stolen goods
into the professional sector.
They'll quickly sell it through the black market.
Look at that dick.
You'll take care of getting the insurance in place.
They're pros.
Play it smart. They have to believe you.
They must be from the Paris suburbs.
If they get into perfume now, we're in deep shit.
Don't worry. We have a solid case. It'll be approved.
Thank you. I'm counting on you.
And after that, we'll meet at Breuil's to make our own recipe for Gold.
You have thousands of empty bottles waiting to be filled by your machines.
I have the perfect team for implementing this gigantic plan.
Without them, it'd be impossible to pack everything up into boxes and pallets
in just one night.
Let's go, guys!
And once we've stuffed your stock with thousands of liters of water,
I can tell you that we'll give Nougarolis a good cleansing.
One last thing before we agree on this.
You'll help get the bastard that betrayed me.
-Yeah? -I got your message. Where is he?
He was in the back of a truck on the way to your barn.
That motherfucker. We're not there anymore. I'll head back.
Look at that son of a bitch. Go on.
Fuck!
SAUVEUR, A COSMETIC VALLEY NEWCOMER
Did you have that put there?
It's not like I didn't owe him anything. That's true.
I came to say goodbye.
That's it. You're leaving?
It's about time.
What about you?
This isn't the time for me to go anywhere.
I'm guessing you saw the report on the water scandal in the perfume world?
Now that Nougarolis is out of the picture,
we're going to buy his business through Sauveur & Sons.
I have a meeting with Jacques-Yves to discuss distribution.
Then I'll make my offer.
What about my suggestion? What? To invest?
I told you to keep it. I don't want your money.
Use it as you wish.
By the way, there was something I promised not to tell you.
The whole idea about the robbery, the insurance. It wasn't my idea.
Whose was it?
There's an angel watching over you, Daniel. A blonde angel.
Thank you. No. I will.
[man] Aw, this looks amazing.
-[man] Dee! Hello. -Hello.
-[man] Please sit. -[Dee] Thank you.
-[Dee] Okay. -You look amazing by the way.
[Dee] Thank you.
Hello.
Hey, so would you like to order something to eat?
-No. I'm fine, thank you. -You sure?
'Cause you know it's gonna be weird watching me watching you eat… watching…
-Yeah? You sure? -I know.
Okay.
[mumbles] It's delicious. Mmm.
-Um, Otis… -Hmm?
-What are we? -Huh?
Are we a thing or just a fling?
[waitress] Excuse me, madam.
-Here is the menu. -[Dee] Thank you.
Dee, see I thought we were keeping things casual.
When you help me, I help you. We help each other.
Did you change your mind?
I need something more than just the physical, you know.
[chuckles] Slow down, eh.
I… I think that,
-maybe we-- -Okay, okay. Dee? Um… So…
There isn't an us.
Yeah?
And if you hoped that maybe things will change down the road,
well, you hoped wrong.
This isn't happening.
I do not do relationships.
Okay?
I mean, come on, look around you. Look.
[softly] Okay.
Dee. Dee. Sit.
-I booked a room. -[sternly] Fuck you.
[whispers] Dee. Dee.
[playfully] Hey, Patricia.
No, I'm just having cake. By myself. [chuckles]
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
No, I am at uh, Urban Eatery. Yeah.
Come through, come over. Come over.
[Otis] Dele!
Okay, let's talk about some of the concerns that you might have.
[Dele] I can tell you that right now is not a good time to talk, Otis.
[Otis] No. Dele, listen
I know it's only been a year since your mom's funeral,
but if your mom and my mom were still alive,
they'd be so happy to see us doing business together.
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to respectfully decline.
Dele, please tell me, what does it take to have your secret change of funding?
Just get it done! Ah!
Um, hold on a second, Otis. Let me come back to you.
Hey babe, what's wrong?
Ah, like I'm so tired. Babe, I'm stressed out. I'm, I'm tired.
-Ah, I don't know. -[spluttering] What can I do to help?
Dele.
Babe, I don't know. Maybe I should take a month off and and sort things out.
Nonsense!
Not when you're working on the biggest case of your career.
What do you want me to do?
[Dele] What's up with the wedding planner?
[woman] But I told you… Oh babe, you don't even listen when I talk to you.
I told you this, I don't trust this wedding planner.
The one I originally wanted is booked till end of year.
[Dele] You know what? Just don't worry about this.
-[Dele] Okay? -I shouldn't worry about it?
[woman] Babe, we have a very important wedding.
You are telling me not to worry about it?
[Otis] Okay. Uh, hey Rita!
What do you think,
about a dream destination wedding in Mombasa?
Otis? He's been listening the whole time?
[Otis] Uh, hey listen. Uh, it'll…
[hesitating] it would be… it's a fabulous idea for both of you.
Hi, Otis.
A traditional destination wedding?
Yeah, let me handle it.
Um Otis, are you even qualified? What do you know about planning weddings?
I have a degree. I did a Major in Wedding Planning. I got you.
Oh okay, Otis. Um, say we let you handle it, right?
Isn't it too late to find something nice?
Rita, stop this foolishness.
Babe!
What can we do about the venue?
Ah. So…
I have a friend, okay?
[Otis] She is from Tanzania. She is called Nandi. Wonderful lady,
and she owns a resort.
Can I give her a call first thing tomorrow morning?
It has to be a Yoruba wedding.
[Otis] Of course, yes. Yes.
[man] Dude, she's a minute away.
[Otis hesitates] Dele, thank you, okay?
I love you, bro. Mwah!
Oh yo!
That was Dele. He's on board.
We just have to do some tiny little bitty thing for him.
[man] Love to see you closing deals. Josh would be proud.
[Dele] Ah, come on, man.
It's been three years. Three years since Josh ditched us
and fucked off to Amsterdam with Belinda. You know, my mom…
My mom left us with the company. That's how lucky we are.
Nick, into banking.
Let It go. Okay?
Let's have some fun.
Let's party!
[woman] Hello?
[woman] Anybody home?
Judy?
[in Swahili] Madam?
♪ Oh TK ♪

-What the f-- -[Otis] ♪ There is nobody like you ♪
[Otis] ♪ Like you ♪
[Otis] ♪ Oh TK ♪
♪ There is nobody like you ♪
[all] Happy Birthday!
♪ Happy Birthday! ♪
You actually did this for me. Thank you.
It was actually him.
-Who? -He set it up.
[in Swahili] This monkey? Lies.
[in Swahili] Monkey?
You're welcome, TK.
And don't you say [in Swahili] I have never done anything for you.
Have you though?
You should actually take some credit too, Celine.
You know, for helping plan all of this.
Yes! My man, Dele.
-Hey. [giggles] -Hey.
[chuckling] Is everything okay?
Do you have a minute?
Yeah.
What's up?
I just wanted to take you out for a thank-you drink.
I mean this party is… It means a lot.
Uh yeah, when, when were you thinking?
Next week. Friday?
-Next week. Friday? -Mm-hmm.
Let me just check the calendar, you know, just in case uh…
see what I'm up to on Friday. Hey,
-it's Valentine's. -Oh is it?
Yes.
[woman] You know this--
Oh. Hi, Otis.
te.
Belinda.
[Otis] Hey.
Valerie.
Grace.
-[Otis] Uh… -[TK] I'm just gonna…
No.
Uh T, TK…
Three million.
That's my final offer.
[woman] How about we do this?
We sell for 3.5 million…
…you pay two million now,
that covers the first half pay for my services and the vendors.
If everything is good to your liking,
you pay the remaining 1.5. That covers the rest of my pay,
the professional video and the wedding album.
How does that sound?
Sounds good.
Draw up the contract by tomorrow and I can send the first pay.
Sounds good to me.
Perhaps, we can discuss the wedding details over lunch.
[TK] In all fairness, setbacks in any projects are inevitable.
Thankfully here at Pinnacle Development, we have contingencies in place.
And because of that, I can assure you,
the estimated completion date for the Capilano Plaza,
is May 2025. Thank you.
Okay. Ladies and gents, any questions?
Miss Maina,
in a culture where it takes months to break ground,
what makes Pinnacle Management different?
In the last ten years, out of 40 Kenyan projects,
fifteen were completed on time.
A third of all those 15 were Pinnacle.
And that is why you're here, right?
Fair enough.
But how do I respond to my partners at Fairmont Capital,
when they hear it's some woman who will be running the show?
That is a very brave question to ask me.
Well, since I started working with Pinnacle,
our overrun costs moved from 8.5 to 3.95.
That is half of the industry's average.
I need something more convincing than your credentials.
Try a personal touch.
How about effective communication?
Choosing the right team, exceptional risk management. Is something funny?
TK, um uh…
we already closed on Fairmont last week.
They absolutely loved you.
So, everyone here
knows that except you.
So I am the last to know.
So you're not a sexist.
She's feisty.
I'm not so sure you want to tell her the other news.
What other news?
Now Selena,
please tell me how are things between you and Richie?
Her name is Celine. My name is Richard.
-Richard. Celine. -Oh,
I'm sorry. I struggle with names.
It's okay.
Please continue, Selena.
[sighs] Celine.
Please stop correcting her, Richard.
Look, she should be able to get our names right.
But she just said she struggles with names.
It's the least she can do considering how much we're paying her, babe.
[Celine] You see?
His narrow mindedness is what I have to deal with everyday.
And now it's gotten to a point where he has a complete disregard
for my personal time and my space and something has to change if--
Oh sorry, I forgot to put my phone on silent. -[therapist chuckles] -[comic music plays]
I have to pick this.
Jeremy.
[therapist] What is it?
Yes, I froze your credit card.
Do you want to take back your words?
Okay, please do so before I consider becoming a widow.
Spouses!
Please continue, Selena.
Celine! Celine. "Ne," "ne".
Oh, sorry.
Now you see how I feel.
[sighs deeply] Actually, I don't.
Look, Richard.
I love you.
And I know that you mean well
and I am really trying to make this work.
It's just that sometimes I feel so…
just so suffocated when I'm around you.
Babe,
last year when you said I should put in more effort in the relationship.
I put my best foot forward. I actually--
Jeremy.
I am at work trying to get an income,
which some of it is going to offset the stupid…
Yes, the stupid debts you put us into.
Please don't call me again.
If you do, I'm going to circumcise you a second time.
Oh now, I have an assignment for you two.
And it's going to be very helpful especially for you, Richie.
Dad, you owe me 80,000 bob.
Eighty thousand, why?
Okay, forty thousand.
Now you're changing. What's your basis?
Your socks don't match your trousers, that's why.
My socks don't match the uh…
You are not even wearing socks.
Okay.
Ten minutes TV, and then you go to bed.
-Promise? -Promise.
-Ten? -Minutes.
High five.
Love you.
So business is looking good.
We have a new investor.
And…
That's good.
I'm proud of you.
How are things with your dad?
[scoffs] What do you think?
-Priti-- -Stop.
I'm good.
You, you are you.
And we're here.
I risked everything for a love that did not exist.
Let's just raise her.
Okay?
What are you watching?
Can I watch with you?
[in Swahili] I'm amazed! It fits perfectly.
[in Swahili] Nandi, how are you?
Hi, dude.
I've been trying to get a hold of you for the last two weeks,
and it's not happening.
[in Swahili] What's happening?
And this Liz lady of yours,
[in Swahili] that you were telling me about is yet to get in touch with me.
Can I please know what's going on?
Is this wedding happening or not?
Let me know.
[in Swahili] Um, let me call her.
[automated voice] Sorry, the mobile subscriber cannot be reached.
Just a minute.
[in Swahili] Pick up, pick up.
The mobile subscriber you're calling is unavailable.
I'll be back.
This was a good second meeting.
I just wish Erastus was here.
He has an urgent project to complete,
but he sends his apologies.
It's important to have one sitting for the two.
Absolutely. He's just been so busy with work at my dad's company.
Trying to prove himself.
But you know, he's not getting married to your father,
or that business of his.
It is you he gets to share the rest of his life.
That's something to consider.
Share my warmest regards to everyone.
Most certainly, Pastor Eric.
-Take care, eh? -You too.

I had to do the fucking presentation in Dar-es-Saalam,
by myself, for a second time.
You know, you'll have to fly one day.
Yeah, it's not gonna happen. Anyway,
I have a very interesting story for you.
Would you like to drink me for a join? Ha, would you like to join me for a drink?
Khalid, Khalid, Khalid.
I fucked up.
I fucked up. Badly.
What did you do?
Aw, who did I do? Who, not what?! Who?!
What are we celebrating?
[Celine] Well, what's going on here?
Find a new man?
You, are looking at Pinnacle's Management
new Vice President of Projects.
Bitch, I'm a boss.
-You got promoted? -I got promoted!
-Oh my goodness. Congratulations! -I know.
Thank you.
And you are baking too. Who have you become?!
TK.
TK.
I hope you didn't have too many.
Bitch, I'm a boss. Fuck.
Judy!
Judy!
Shit.
-Judy! -Judy!
-[TK] Judy! [laughs] -Judy!
Yoh, she didn't…hey!
-Deputy Jesus. -Judy.
[TK] You know, now that my career is on track,
I thought I'd really be happy, you know.
Living my best life…
My love life is the shambles.
At least you have some hope.
I keep trying to express to Richard that I need some time to myself.
Then every time that I do need some me time,
he finds a way to penetrate himself in there.
Like, if I knew that moving into his area would be this bad,
I would have just stayed where I was.
Cause like at this point,
my biggest fear is that if I move in with him,
[whispers] I'll strangle him in his sleep.
And the only word that I heard, is penetrate.
[Celine] Hmm. Look who's up. Hey, welcome back.
[TK] What do you think of the unethical monogamy?
[Celine] Polyamory?
[TK] There's a difference. I mean one, you are open to it,
and you know who the others are.
Polyamorous is…
It's like fornication, eh.
But I think we're just tied up at so many expectations
because truly, can one person,
truly give you all you need and want?
If you put it that way…
I think we should just accept the new way of life.
And who knows? It could bring an end to cheating, heartache…
-You know… -He is fucking my dad's secretary.
I actually liked her.
That little bitch.
[TK] Fuck.
-[Judy sobs] -[Celine] Can I help?
-[TK] Sis… -It's okay.
Otieno, it's six. What the fuck?
Dele arrives in less than a week
and is expecting a lavish wedding at the coast that I promised.
I'm not panicking. Do I look like I'm panicking? I'm not panicking.
What? Help me.
Okay guys, I'm sorry. I know this is off topic,
but why do all of you look like shit?
[Robin] Well, apart from you, Richie. Hi, Richie.
Hi, uh…
It's Richard, but I see motherhood looks good on you.
Oh, thanks Richard. I love it.
Oh. Okay guys,
can we please get back to my falling apart life?
Chill the fuck out, Otis.
[child's voice] Mom, you said a bad word.
No. I didn't say…
I said yuck. Like, yuck the chill out.
Jesus of Nazareth, guys!
Dele and Rita are flying on Friday, okay?
And that's why I'm turning to every one of you to please,
please help me out. I know, I know I messed up.
Okay? But at least the hotel is booked.
My girl, Nandi, she's got me.
Oh, one of your little whores.
No, TK. She's not a whore.
And I don't do whores.
Judy um, why are you still wearing sunglasses?
Oh, that's why it's so dark.
Guys, please I need you!
Please, I'm begging, help me!
Okay? It's the coast.
Well to be honest, it's very tempting,
but um, I'll just pass.
Robin, I know you despise me.
No, it's not about that. I mean um,
I have children to look after.
-Yeah, motherhood. You know these things… -[plates crashes on floor]
Hey, Cyril!
Stop, drop that. Put it down.
Okay guys, I gotta go. Good luck! Okay.
Cyril.
I'm out.
It's your mess, Otis
It was a bad idea to begin with.
Khalid,
it affects you just as much as it affects me.
If we don't handle this, we won't make it past the fourth quarter.
You're pathetic. I'll book a ticket.
Guys, I'm on vacation.
I don't intend to spend it doing damage control, okay?
Good luck, Otis.
TK.
No, thanks. And besides you have Nandi.
[in Swahili] What kind of name is that?
[in Swahili] She is Tanzanian.
What should I do about it?
Also, I have a fear of flying. So can I please borrow your car?
I guess that's what a four-year relationship looks like.
Boring and complacent.
Is that why you swing from one cleavage to another?
[in Swahili] Man, what's wrong with you?
[Khalid] Just asking, jeez!
Okay then, can we talk about something else?
Yeah, like…
Like what? Like…
like how you got duped?
-[Celine] Richard… -[Richard] Hmm?
when I was napping, why didn't you tell Otis to stop by the Man Eaters?
Last I checked, we were giving each other some space.
In this case, verbally, Celine.
Well, it would have been nice to stop there seeing as it's a historical site.
I wasn't aware.
I hinted about it yesterday.
Celine, do I look like I can read minds?
Clearly not.
[Otis] Oh shit!
You and your heavy foot.
[in Swahili] Where are you going to?
[in Swahili] We're headed this way…
Why are you over speeding?
Boss, we weren't speeding. The speed limit for the highway is 110km/hr.
Here it's 80km/hr.
Alight from the vehicle.
The way I see you, you look like a very reasonable person.
Why were you speeding? And you know the fines are usually very high.
Then show us the speed gun.
If we were speeding, we will pay the fine and I will go to court.
You know, if we factor in the speed gun,
It's a whole lot… eh, that's a big process.
Because I'll have to go to the station. So much work,
you know, a lot of paperwork.
Officer, we have all the time in the world.
You don't have to pull that card, eh? What is in your wallet?
It's not much but…
Here.
Bro, why are you giving me a condom?
For you to be safe when you are taking bribes.
Get out of here, you idiot!
-Idiot! -[Otis] Officer!
-[Otis] See you later. -Go away!
That one is an idiot. [laughs]
[Otis] …an introduction.
[Otis] You're welcome.
-[Richard] Hi. -[Otis] Nandi!
Nandi, Nandi.
-[in Swahili] You've pissed me off, Otis. -What?
I keep on calling you every time and you are not answering my calls.
Come on give me a hug.
-How are you? -I'm great. You look good.
[in Swahili] Thank you.
So, I have rooms booked for you and for your wedding guests.
Everything else is sold out.
Unless otherwise, if you want to pay for executive rooms.
Okay. Uh, hi guys. This is Nandi.
Nandi, these are the guys.
Hi.
Also, we will be sharing rooms.
Ah, in that case, my girlfriend and I would like to get a suite.
I heard you say something about executive.
No. No, baby.
Come on, why not?
'Cause it's not in our budget.
I'll make a discount for you.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Oh. The two of you make a cute couple together.
Thank you.
I'll take one of those too.
For you it will have to be a full rate.
What?!
Just get the executive suite, right?

-Goodnight. -[grunts in annoyance]
[Khalid] Everyone, please turn to page two of the plan.
These are your assigned tasks based on your strengths.
Do we have, uh, a list of local vendors we can tap into?
Of course. Even wedding planners around here, we have.
[in Swahili] Unluckily, the event planner we were to hire on the day of the wedding is not available
because he has another wedding.
[Otis] Okay. Uh, Rita's words,
"Otis, we must get the Yoruba music right."
So they're flying in their own DJ.
[Khalid] Oh, excellent.
[Otis] Uh… Excellent, yes.
Okay! Uh yeah, one last thing.
They fly in on Friday.
[all] What?!
-[Judy] Otis, what? -[Khalid] What?!
What the fuck? Otis!
Okay. [in Swahili] Talk to me.
Show me the big white one again, Dad.
Big white… [sighs]
Priya, I've shown you like five times.
Help me choose. Which one?
They all look really yummy but you should pick that one.
This one?
[Otis] Are you sure?
Uh, I wouldn't go for a fondant cake.
Fondle. What is fondle cake?
There's nothing to fondle. Fondant.
Fondant.
I'd suggest, uh, buttercream cake.
I say fondant cake. Is TK there?
She always knows what to do.
Young lady, when did you become this smart?
I love you. Mwah, mwah. Daddy loves you.
So you were saying, uh, fondle cake?
Fondant.
-Fondant. -Yes.
Gentlemen. I have three rules.
Rule Number One, this is my kitchen.
Rule Number Two, this is my kitchen.
Once you register those rules into your thinking stations,
then you'll register Rule Number Three.
Do as I say.
Are we clear?
Silence!
This is serious now.
Serious.
-[Khalid] What… [giggles] -[giggles]
[chef] Get to work!
-[Nandi] Hey, ladies. -[Judy] Hi.
I just wanted to see if you girls are okay.
I think we're good. Thank you.
That top really looks nice on you.
Where did you get it?
It was a gift from Richard.
Aw, that's so sweet of him.
[Nandi] So, what is he like?
He's brilliant. He's funny and insightful.
He's decent.
[Nandi in Swahili] He looks like it.
I mean, he is not like the guys that I am used to meeting in my life.
He has some affinity to him, you know?
Maybe we should just, you know, continue here.
Okay, um, if you need anything, just let me know.
-[Celine] Mm-hmm. -Okay.
You know, Khalid,
my dad used to tell me,
"Richard,
as a man you must understand,
that you can never understand women.
There are only three things you can tell them.
'You are right,'
'I love you,'
'And I'm so sorry babe.'"
What a bunch of BS.
That man was so wrong.
Hey, chill bro. You sound like you're digging for buried treasure.
That's because he is when he shouldn't be. You see,
the real understanding of a woman,
comes from accepting the fact that she is human.
And is allowed to make mistakes, changes,
and decisions for herself.
So what?
So instead of you trying to figure her out in order to fix her,
you need to allow her to feel accepted and supported.
Once we show her that kind of support and love,
it empowers her to become her true self.
And give love at the same way.
You know, those are very wise words,
but they're coming from a man with very crude character.
By pointing that finger at me,
look how many fingers are pointing back at you.
Babe.
I think I just had a rude awakening.
-Oh my God! -Baby--
Maybe I've been looking through
the wrong lens and it can be haunting.
It can be haunting, you know.
Can you just hold on to that thought?
And it's so messed up the way
I always want to be right about every single fucking thing,
when really all I should care about is what's true.
Baby, can you just give me three minutes of--
And babe, babe, babe,
I am so one-sided on a whole lot of topics
And I think that it's time--
[Celine yells] Richard!
[agitatedly] I have to yell so that you can listen?
God, it's so annoying.
Now, I have to start over cause I'm not fucking calm.
Either you shut the fuck up or you fuck off.
[Richard] I never pegged you to be one to sit at a bar.
Jeez. Jesus, you scared me.
Oh, my bad.
Am I that hideous?
Gin and tonic, please.
What do you have there?
Soda. I am not a fan of alcohol.
Actually, I think I'll have a moscato instead.
Moscato?
-Mosquito juice? -[chuckles]
No, a moscato.
It's a fizzy sweet drink,
usually rosé or white wine.
Celine thinks it's a boring drink.
I mean, I'd offer you a sip,
but I'm going to respect your decision.
Oh, [laughs] I thought you said you weren't a fan.
This is definitely not a boring drink.
-[laughs] -Yeah? [laughs]
Okay.
I think I'm going through a phase or something.
Okay.
[Richard] So you're taking the fourth, what?
Your eyes…
they are very intense.
I'm going to the beach for a walk.
You wanna come?
[Judy] Such a beautiful evening. I really love beach walks.
[Richard] They are even better if you have good company.
You know, I thought I had good company.
I was replaced.
I found him in the arms of another woman.
You didn't deserve that.
No listen, you didn't deserve that, Judy.
This world can be a cruel and nasty place sometimes,
but the things people do to us,
they are not a reflection of who we are.
I need you to remember that.
Hey.
-[Nandi] Hello. -[TK] Hi. Is Otis and the team here?
Yes.
-[in Swahili] Welcome. Come. -[in Swahili] Thank you.
Excuse me.
-Sorry. -Do you know where the restaurant is?
[Nandi] Oh, the restaurant? Okay.
[Nandi in Swahili] Straight ahead, then take a left.
Pass the swimming pool on your right.
From there, it's easy to find it.
Follow the signs.
Thank you. Bye.
[Nandi in English] You look beautiful.
Come on, let's go.
It's not far.
[Nandi in Swahili] I have asked for it…
TK!
Hi.
Hi. [in Swahili] Welcome.
What's wrong?
[TK in Swahili] You guys are mad.
TK, what's wrong?
What's wrong?
[Otis] Ah, TK. You are here!
-Are you happy to see me? -[Otis] Oh, yes I am!
[TK] What did you want to borrow from me this time?
Ah, come on, what's that supposed to mean?
Otis, have you ordered the cake?
Yes, I did. Fondle.
-Fondle my tits? -Oh yes.
A fondant cake?
What the fuck?! What's wrong with the butter one?
The fondant is like eating plastic.
I'd rather the latter.
We need to give it an element of class.
These Naijos think we are like, backward.
-Like we're just all about the foreheads. -Yeah!
East African foreheads.
-Yes! -We are about class.
-Class! -Okay!
Well, you already have the ass just show them the C-L.
-Okay. -Oh.
[Otis] Welcome to The Cave.
[Otis] Here's a toast to every single one of you,
for making all this a possibility.
I wouldn't…
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you guys. So, thank you.
Thank you so much for coming through. TK, for your last-minute save,
thank you so much.
[in Swahili] My man,
[in English] for your leadership.
Cheers.
Here. To teamwork,
and solid friendships,
and loyalty…
[sardonically] Loyalty!
Baby, it's okay.
Just relax today. It's done.
Cheers.
[Otis] Okay. Let us eat.
Judy just needs to break up with Erastus 'cause first of all,
what kind of name is Erastus?
He's always putting her down.
The only thing that he does have is the audacity.
Baby?
Richard look,
[softly] I know that we haven't exactly had the smoothest time.
That's why I've been doing some thinking.
And I'm sorry that I haven't been the easiest person to deal with.
Baby, I need you to know that I love you.
And that I know we can make this work.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Yeah.
-[man1] Abeo. -[Abeo] Eh?
-[man1 in Yoruba] Please… -[Abeo] Yeah.
[man1] Don't we have, eh, beach resorts in Lagos?
Eh, so why did we have to come all this way?
Don't you want to see the legendary women of Kenya?
I hear they cure prostate cancer. [laughs]
[man1] Who told you that?
-[Abeo in Yoruba] Me! -[man1 in Yoruba] Who told you that?
[in English] Who told you that?
[woman1 in Igbo] What are you two going on about?
Your balls shrunk a long time ago.
[in Igbo] Shh! That's enough!
-[man1] Ah. Bedroom talk! -[Abeo chuckles]
[Otis] Dele, Dele, Dele.
[Dele] My guy, you guy.
How was your flight?
It was long but comfortable.
Eh, the flight to your wedding must be comfortable.
-Rita. -Hello.
I can't thank you so much for trusting me with your wedding.
You're welcome. And I can't wait to see the beautiful decorations.
Oh, you will love it. Mwah!
-This is TK. -Hi, TK.
I want to see what you have done. Right now.
Of course, Aunty. Please. Welcome.
[Otis in Swahili] Welcome.
[Otis] And here,
ladies and gentlemen, is where creativity meets elegance.
An outdoor experience is exactly what this reception needs.
-[Rita wailing] -[Otis] What is it?
Otis, when I asked you if you could do a Yoruba wedding,
-what did you say? -I said I could do it.
Does this look like a Yoruba wedding to you?
What village idiots do you take us for?
[Rita] Babe! What happened to the the message I sent to you?
What message?
I sent you an email with detailed instructions over a month ago.
Otis, I didn't pay you money,
to do a rubbish white wedding.
I mean, what is this?
No, tell me. What is this?
-Dele! -[spluttering] What is this?
Guy, guy…
No tell me! Otis,
if my wedding turns out to be a fiasco,
not a single penny of mine will be invested in your company.
Your son's temper is very questionable.
Very questionable. No, I am concerned for Rita's safety.
What can I do to make it better? Rita.
-Rita, what do I do? -A lot. A lot! A whole lot!
Everything!
-Was it not your wife and daughter… -Mm-hmm.
…who almost kicked airport security this morning?
I should be concerned for your son's safety.
Greetings, everyone.
Excuse me!
Hello!
[Rita] She's not answering.
Excuse me!
Hello?
-Me? -Yeah, you. Who else?
You're the planner we met earlier, right?
You're the one responsible for this mess?
Why won't you fix it?
What is wrong with you people?
Why are you so slow?
You know, a wise man once told me,
you are the reflection of the insults you throw at people.
[laughs mockingly] Listen lady,
I read my palms today.
[in Igbo] I read my palms today. It said I'm going to slap someone today.
-She's the one I will slap. I'll slap you. -[in Kikuyu] You'll slap who?
-[in Igbo] I'm going to slap you. -You'll slap who?Are you mad?
-No problem. It's you I will slap you. -Are you mad?
Are you…
[in English] What n the Nollywood shit is this?
Are you mad?
Come back, Patience Ozokwor. [in Kikuyu] Come!
[Otis moans] Oh, TK…
What did you call me?
Kate?
[moans] Oh, TK.
Get out.
[Celine] Excuse me.
[Otis] Fuck!
What? What is this?
-It's a destination. -[TK] Really?
Look, the place is a destination.
-It's a destination wedding. -Hey, hey.
-Look. [in Swahili] Look! -Otis.
Destination. Wedding.
What the fuck is a Yoruba wedding?
Ah TK, what the fuck is a Yoruba wedding, tell me?
[in Swahili] I swear to God, Rita is driving me mad!
-Otis-- -No, listen . I don't care.
I don't care. What the fuck is a Yoruba wedding? At this point,
I just want Rita to f…
What were you going to say?
-Huh? -Eh?
What was it you wanted to say?
-[Rita] What was it you wanted to say? -Rita…
-You see at this point, -Eh?
I want you to forget
-Forget? -about the fuss that is going on.
And concentrate with the fuss with Dele.
That's it.
What do you want me to do?
To the kitchen with the men.
Men, why?
-Why? -Otis!
[mutters under breath] Rubbish!
[Rita's mom ranting in Igbo] You silly cook!
Come, you must cook this food the way I want it.
Better keep listening to me,
didn't I…
If I cook it, one day I will break you.
-[in Igbo] I will break you! -[cook in Swahili] Get out of my kitchen!
Don't you understand what I'm saying?
[Rita's mom in Igbo] Look, don't butt heads roughly with me. I will break you!
-[Rita's mom] I will lock you up. -[chef] I'll burn your face.
[in Igbo] Take a good look at me, you animal!
Look at me!
Are you all witnessing this?
When I deal with him, eh! When I deal with him!
You must cook it! Don't you know…
[in English] Why did you remove the block of knives?
Years ago,
my mother had problems with the way that Ini was raising our child.
When my wife had had enough,
she chased my mother out of the house, with a knife!
-[Abeo] No! -Ah-ah.
-She's that dangerous? -Oh.
Why are you still married to her?
Abeo!
The streets of Lagos are very dangerous.
Go.
-[Khalid] Okay, what do we do? -[Ini] Do you understand?
-[Ini] I will deal with you. -We are all friends.
Come on, Chef, we are going to have to change the menu.
We also got the information very late.
Bro, I don't have any problem with that.
I just don't appreciate
being spoken to in that manner, especially in my kitchen.
We're going to need him if we're going to make this work.
[Ini] And now, gentlemen,
this is my first item on my menu.
[in Arabic] Allah, protect me from this absurdity.
What's in it?
What's crack-a-lackin'? How ya'll doing?
What?
What?
What?
Oh, no!
-[Khalid laughs] -[chef] Bro, stop.
Get out!
No.
[TK] Guys, we just have a few hours to transform this into a Yoruba wedding,
so I found some photos. So Judy, Celine,
you set up this area to become a reception area.
That will also give you time to talk.
You coming with me to the florist and to the fabric store.
And the… shit!
TK, we need to talk about this buttercream cake.
I think I'd rather a fondant cake.
Why would you want a fondant one, what's wrong with the butter one?
It's not elegant enough.
[in Kikuyu] What an idiot.
Listen, I'll have a fondant cake
and that's not up for debate.
Rita trust me, we are okay with what we have.
TK, you will go to the shop,
and you'll order a fondant cake.
And that's final.
Listen, you're more than welcome to go do it yourself.
I'm doing Otis a favor.
I could be doing something else like lounging on the beach
and yet I'm here helping you.
Oh, and FYI, it takes two to three days to bake and decorate a fondant cake.
Good luck with that.
[in Swahili] Leave me alone!
Fine.
-We'll have it your way then. -Yeah.
[TK in English] Fondle, fondle, what am I fondling here?
[in Swahili] You think I have nothing better to do?
Don't bore me!
[in English] You go eat, you carry some fufu and go eat there, shut up!
I am so sick and tired of these Nigerians. I have had enough. I just wanna…
[in Swahili] Speak of the devil, here they come.
-Where's Otis? -He's here.
Didn't he send you guys text messages or emails about the changes?
-What changes? -We were meant to have a Yoruba wedding.
I can't believe that idiot forgot to mention it.
Who are you calling an idiot?
Are these the people you entrusted your wedding with?
[in Swahili] Hold this for me. This lady's always rubbing my shoulder the wrong way.
Let me tell you, I will beat you up
till you won't remember if you gave birth to this girl or you farted her. You!
[Abeo] Our people are great at being nice,
-gentle and respectful to other people. -Mm-hmm.
It makes you wonder what it is they are not great at.
Well, being nice, gentle and respectful,
to other people.
-[laughs] Abeo. -[chuckles]
[Rita] Who's your friend?
-[in Yoruba] You're also a hacker! -[TK] "Yahoo!"
-You're also a hacker! -"Yahoo!"
-You're also a hacker! -"Yahoo!"
-You're also a hacker! -"Yahoo!"
[TK] Yahoo hackers, hackers of emotions.
Get a canoe and go to Enugu and do it there.
Nonsense!
[TK] To hell with these goons!
[TK] So how many are these in a dozen?
[vendor] Maybe six.
Oh, six? Oh, okay. And then maybe we'll get a bouquet like this one.
And then, we add this.
Kagwe!
[TK] Okay.
Yeah.
I can't take all the credit. You have some moves.
Old school but, still, good moves.
A note of appreciation from the lady over here.
You, my dear, are a dancer.
-Stop. -I will not stop. Make me.
Make me stop and make…
We have… we have to go.
Is everything okay?
Oh shit,
that doesn't look good.
You don't say.
Do you need any help?
I can manage myself.
Yo man, I have two hands. The more the merrier.
[Otis] Okay.
Let's have a look with what we're working here with.
It's actually harder than it looks.
Let's make it softer. Yeah.
I like the way you think sometimes,
lubricate it as much as you can.
-Yes. -Yes.
-Yeah. -Yes.
-Yes? -Yes.
-[Otis] It's going up. Yes! -Yes!
[Otis] Yes!
[Otis] Oh, yes.
Oh, don't mind me.
I'm all for equal rights for everyone.
Equal… No, no, it was…
-Good job, Dele. -Hmm.
-Question. -Yeah?
-Do you play golf? -Of course.
I found a golf course around here.
Let's go, hit some balls.
I have to help out in the kitchen.
Ah, forget the kitchen. I'm sure they can do without you.
Come on, let's go.
Celine…
Celine, I have a confession.
Judy and I…
Fuck.
Celine…
we need to talk…
Fuck! Who the fuck says, "We need to talk."?
Celine.
I just realized that you and I have never been on a beach together.
So, do you wanna go for a walk?
Um… Listen, Celine.
There's something you should know.
And it's going to kill me if I stay quiet about it.
Okay.
In the last few days, I've realized that,
I haven't been the person that you need me to be.
Maybe both of us just haven't been in the right--
No, listen.
If we're both going to evolve in this relationship together,
then there's something you must know.
What is it?
Baby…
I…
I want you to have my last name.
Are you asking me what I think you're asking me?
-Celine Kariuki… -Yes?
Will you marry me?
Yes!
Listen, Khalid.
I may come across as someone who beats around the bush,
but I only did that to protect myself from people who are out to get my money.
I guess you have your reasons.
Am I making the right decision investing in Otis?
If I were you, I wouldn't drop a single dime.
Two years ago, maybe.
Right now, the economy is shitty,
and even though Janta Linux connects the
unemployed to the employer,
there's really no ROI for you.
Our clientele, the employers are either paying peanuts or nothing.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I don't like to beat around the bush.
I have a proposal for you.
For a year, I have been creating data clouds for small businesses.
One of my clients has great connections with government and
I need money to hire engineers to help expand.
Right?
Hey.
I said, hey.
TK, we need to talk about yesterday.
[Otis] After a situation like that, we need to talk about it.
What an idiotic DJ! He should have just mentioned
that he was having issues with his visa.
-Otis! -Hey.
Kate!
Otis.
I'm impressed you can remember my name.
How's the hangover?
It's okay. I survived. How do you guys know each other?
Uh, she's my maid of honor.
Listen Otis, um, my DJ can't make it. Now I have to find a replacement.
Uh, that's okay, I can DJ for you.
You can?
Thank you so much. That'll be amazing.
So I have some equipment coming in in like ten minutes.
-So you can-- -You, DJing. How?
What can I do to help?
Thank you. You're a rock star. Please um, let's
You don't even have a DJ controller. You don't have that.
I can use an app, okay?
You had uh, equipment.
-Yeah, thank you. You are a rock star. -Okay, just send me
playlists, songs, something to play around with and then I'll…
we'll see what we can do.
-Yo. -Hey.
Congratulations bruv, you two are finally tying the knot.
Oh, uh… Yeah.
Yeah, thanks. Um, I finally decided
four years just seemed a bit too long.
I respect your bravery.
Wait, what?
Why?
You guy, it happened a very long time ago.
It probably doesn't matter now, okay?
-You're getting married. Congratulations. -Otis.
Fuck, fuck.
Out with it.
Come on, just say it.
Rita, you are so original,
about having your traditional
as a destination wedding over here.
Get me a Kenyan man, so I can do the same.
Well, good luck with that.
Why would you say that?
Finding a good Kenyan man is like,
impossible.
-No… -Especially you, Otis.
[Otis] No. All of you had an opportunity.
Our own Kenyan sisters are looking for your Nigerian brothers.
[TK] A Nigerian man will take you out,
spoil you rotten regardless of the money in his wallet.
And, in between the sheets,
Ooh! He will satisfy you before he satisfies himself.
Yeah, but we are telling you now.
-But you still call yourselves my friends? -We're telling you now.
-We are telling you now. -Ah, come on man.
-That was a long time ago. -No. That doesn't explain it.
That was a long time ago.
-And your Kenyan men? -Useless.
Hmm?
Celine. Celine!
When were you planning on telling me that you fucked Josh?
When were you going to tell me?
Baby, that was years ago.
[Richard] Don't give me that bullshit.
We were together, you could have told me. You had so many opportunities to tell me.
It was a… I was in a different point in my life…
And I wasn't even sure that I had feelings for Josh.
Oh, so you decided to jump in the sheets with him, to get your answer?
[Celine] Richard!
And you know that Josh and I were tight growing up.
I know everyone knows about you and Josh.
I am sick and tired of hearing about Josh.
Why am I the last person to know about this?
And now I realize that was the only reason you invited me to that dinner.
So that you could make him jealous.
Right?
You never really liked me in the first place.
But in the end I chose you, right?
This is why you can't be happy, Celine.
Wasting our time with all this bullshit therapy, when all this time,
you've always been comparing me to Josh
but I will never be him. Will I, Miss Spontaneous?
More like Miss Indecisive to me.
Hold it right there, Jesus.
As if you have a leg to stand on.
What?
Lead by example, tell her. Tell her!
I think you should chime in on this conversation, Judy.
Tell her!
Wesley Pipes, you can't talk?
Jada Fire, something you have to say?
Bending each other over on these Swahili balconies,
with each other's tongues in your throats.
[Rita's dad] Abeo.
This eh, Twitter dating dramas,
they're so much more interesting than those eh, those couples
that are always conflicting themselves on Oprah.
Ah-ah.
What are you two gossips doing here?
They don't close the windows properly around here anymore.
[singing in Igbo] Eddie Kwanza, bia o, bia o
Celine.
Who are you preaching to?
Ah, sorry. Sorry, guys.
It's my daughter. Hey.
Hey Priya, I'll call you back. Okay. Yes, yes. I love you.
I love you.
I'm getting a Nigerian man.
[TK] Shit!
Yo!
Ah, you better? I'll hold you to it.
Because shit!
Eish!
That's some shit. These guys don't play.
Celine, can I talk to you?
Celine, please.
[TK] You've done a lot of talking by saying nothing.
[Judy] Maybe things would've been different if we'd have told her to tell--
Judy, if you and Richard came clean.
Maybe things would have been different if we would have encouraged her
to tell Richard the truth about Josh four years ago.
Seriously? Wow.
[in Swahili] What are you crying over?
[in English] What the fuck?!
[in Swahili] Drink up, just like you do the boys.
Hey, boss.
Why are you DJing?
Uh, standing in for Rita's DJ.
Yo, Khalid.
I see you and uh, Dele
getting a bit too close.
Are you jealous?
No.
I'm just saying, if you need any help closing the deal,
look for me.
If he brings it up, you'll be the first to know.
Why are you not dancing?
Just not in the best of moods tonight.
Well, that's the reason why you need to dance.
It will cheer you up.
And I will enjoy seeing you.
Thanks, but…
I'm good.
If I was a guest in this wedding,
I would have grabbed you by your hand
and took you to the dancing floor,
and maybe to my room.
I'm just saying.
Listen, Nandi…
I'm flattered.
I really am but…
you forget that I came here with someone who I happen to love.
She's important to me.
And I'd like to do right by her so…
Let's just leave it at that.
And besides there's more than a few guys in there
who are dying to mingle with you tonight.
Well, excuse me, guys.
Yo, Dele!
Hey, what's up, fam?
When can you send the rest of the…
Otis, today is my wedding day.
You know what?
I was going to save this for later but
now is probably better.
I will not be investing in your company.
Wait, what?
Why?
I decided to go in another direction.
Man, come on, be straight with me. What's up?
I saw the financials of your company and
it doesn't look promising.
It's a family business. That's why we need your help.
With your help, we can weather any storm.
Is that what you meant when you said my portfolio could be better?
Come on, man,
-I kept my end of the deal! -Yes, you did!
-But it was messy. -Then fulfill your side of the deal too.
You know the beauty of this is I'm not obligated to.
We're done here.
-Ah, no. -Best of luck with everything.
No, no. Stop this stupidity. Fuck you!
Ten thousand Shillings says that they
are about to take your son for his honeymoon in an ambulance.
-Fuck you! -[Otis] Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Hey, hey!
-Fuck you! -Hey!
Hey, Otis!
Leave him alone, Otis.
Let him come at me.
Ah, no. Come!
[Otis in Swahili] Let go of him!
[Celine squeals] Richard!
What the hell, Otis?
-I'll double it. -Hmm?
Dele will put him in the sea.
Unusual.
Did you not see the right hook from the Kenyan?
I will triple it. Put your money where your mouth is.
Ah-ah, this one?
This one? This one is not strong.
This is "Rumble in Mombasa" not "Rumble in the Jungle."
I've always had bad anxiety.
Nowadays they call it something fancy,
ADHD.
TK, I feel like I messed up everything.
You haven't lost anything. You just look at the world with the wrong lens.
You still have your company.
Khalid has proven he can lead, let him.
And you have friends that love you so much.
So much so they flew across the country to help you plan a wedding,
despite us hating them all.
And I mean you have a fair share of women to be used when needed.
Used! Again with that word, Jesus!
I wonder why?
Again, kicking a guy when he's down.
You know what, Otis?
You want to stand here and feel sorry for yourself, be my guest.
You know, I was doing just fine standing here by myself.
Okay? I didn't need your insights.
You always rely on me to come clean your mess. Always.
And you never, ever show me gratitude, Otis. Ever!
And when I try to make myself vulnerable to you, you…
I, what?
Never mind.
What are you doing here, TK?
Why are you helping me? To be used again?
Cause this is what we do.
You cry for help. I come to the rescue.
-For what, Otis? -Say it, for what?
Don't tell me what to do, Otis.
[yells] Then tell me what you want!
You!
Fuck! What is this shit?
And why am I the only one pouring my heart out if all it leads to is a dead end?
What's all this for?
You fall in love, I fall in love…
We start speaking about forever…
We start feeling those mushy, fuzzy things inside and then--
And then, what? What?
Then we get bored.
We start feeling fuzzy for someone else.
And you know what happens?
Another broken heart.
Pretending that it doesn't hurt, and because we're men,
oh men don't feel any pain.
You ladies can curl up together, drink your wine,
pour your feelings out. What do I do?
Do I call my guys to drink whiskey?
No, fuck that shit. Ah-ah.
Well, I guess we are just in different places in our lives.
TK, don't blame me if I'm not the guy that you hoped I would be.
Why is it so hard for you to try?
If I had known you'd be this scared, Otis, I wouldn't have bothered.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know!
I don't know.
But what I do know…
The fear that's in your eyes right now, Otis…
is the same fear I saw the other day when I gambled
and kissed you.
Let's just pretend nothing ever happened, ever.
I'll send you the financials and…
Please, take your time.
Of course.
Next time you are in Lagos, let's play some golf.
Absolutely.
Thank you so much, guys. Bye.
Bye.
Look.
I know it's none of my business,
but I do think you and Otis would make a really cute couple.
There's a time I would have believed that but there's just nothing there.
Let me tell you, there was a whole situation.
Nothing happened,
because he was literally saying your name the entire time.
But they're clearly feelings there.
-Hey. -Hey.
What's up?
Judy, I don't think I can do this.
I hate flying.
You know, it's funny how we all just deal with different fears.
Celine and Richard, they drove back?
Okay, first of all, this isn't fear. Yeah?
And yes, they did.
It's hectic!
You know, we should have all just chartered a flight.
[automated voice] Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention?
-Announcing the arrival of Flight -[Judy] That's us.
-Yeah. -Nine-zero-J-one-eight-six-zero-five…
…boarding of passengers…
Okay so look, I know it's none of my business but
you and TK barely spoke to each other after the second day.
-What happened? -[Otis sighs heavily]
She has some feelings, and I don't know what I have.
Wait, wait, wait.
You're the guy she was rooting for?
Wah, okay, now it all…
Now, it all makes sense.
What do you mean?
The night before the trip,
the ladies night we, got high and,
TK mentioned someone special.
Dude, you got high? Wow.
It's not like I planned it.
I also didn't plan to fall in love.
Okay. What if I do,
and then it fails?
TK will never want me to be a part of her life again. I can't.
You have to give it a try.
What if I fuck up?
Then it will have been worth it.
And if not, at least you get to fuck them.
Oh my God! Judy!
Alcohol!
Uh Fiona, could you get me the, uh…
Come in.
I came to…
I came to say that,
you were right.
All along.
My mother's company was dying and,
[in Swahili] I was scared.
[in English] And instead of pulling the trigger,
I used you,
your sweat, your blood,
and I dragged you into the unnecessary.
I let you down.
Thanks.
Thank you, that…
means a lot.
Okay.
You have somewhere you need to be?
Yeah. Uh, unfortunately I…
I have a flight to catch.
I have an interview with our dear friend Kimotho.
I could, uh…
I could use you as a negotiator.
I'm expensive.
I know you messed up but,
no one deserves Kimotho.
Do you need any help?
What are you doing here?
I came…
I came to say that you were right about the cake.
Is that all?
I also came to say that I'm sorry.
Sorry for being a dickhead to you.
Go on.
I'm also grateful.
For everything that you've done for me, ok.
Go on Otis.
Come on, TK man, I am trying.
Okay, fine, I'll stop.
It's all fun and games to you.
I was doing just fine, then you show up here ready drag me back to your shit.
I was hoping we could make it our shit.
It doesn't even sound the way you want it to sound.
If there's anyone who
is more deserving of a genuine loving relationship, it's you.
If there's anyone I'm vulnerable with,
it's also you.
I'm saying this is a friend.
I have a question.
And a comment.
What if I told you, I don't want to be friends with you anymore?
What would you do?
I'd respect your decision.
You were right that day.
I was scared.
What was the comment?
Seems like…
seems like fear has vanished from your eyes.
[in Swahili] The baby is doing fine. You're due in about eleven weeks.
I will see you in a couple of weeks just to see how you're faring.
Thank you, Doctor.
I guess we'll see you in a couple of weeks.
Khalid?
Hi.
Your grades are troublesome.
Yes, ma'am.
What do you want to do in the future? Tell me.
Well, I want to be an ice-sculpting champion.
Oh, my dear. Wake up. Thailand doesn't have any snow.
Well…
I don't know. But I saw it once and liked it. It's beautiful, ma'am.
I think that it's possible. It's just…
I have to find a way. I guess.
Try to think about something possible, okay?
I want to travel the world. Monthon.
Traveling the world is not a career, hon. Does traveling the world give you money?
Well, I'd record a video of myself traveling. And then upload it on the internet.
If a lot of people watch it, I will get sponsors and earn money.
Well, I would go by myself. I'd record it myself.
A girl traveling the world alone is impossible.
It's dangerous. Don't you know? -Huh? -I see.
-Huh? -I see.
I want to be an artist.
I want to write rap songs and…
release singles, make albums, and sign on with a big international label. Then…
hold my own concert. Earn a lot of money. Make a career out of it.
However, I think… a career can't be made from singing this kind of song.
It's possible, ma'am. It really can be a career. It's like…
Snoop Dogg. Or Eminem.
They release rap songs, and whoa! So mind-blowing, ma'am.
-It's-- -I understand what you're saying
but I don't think it's a career.
I'll be a doctor then. Excellent.
HIGH SCHOOL ACADEMIC TRANSCRIPTION
I'm going to print my picture on t-shirts and sell them at a high price.
I'll hold a concert and give money away to the audience.
And I'll spray water from my mouth on them too.
Ong.
Please, sympathize with me. I'm really tired today.
I want to raise an ant colony-- Stop, please.
I want to grow and sell marijuana.
Petch. Let me ask one thing of you. Please do not do anything drug-related.
Ma'am. Marijuana is an herb. -It treats diseases. -Petch.
Drug users die, sellers go to jail.
Hello.
Come on. Take off your cap when talking with me.
This term, you still have only 2.1. I think it's too late. Let me ask you.
What are you good at? You have to be good at something.
I…
play sport stacking.
Sport stacking,
the popular sport of stacking cups in the US that tests your brain?
Stop playing. Do you want to end up working on an assembly line?
But…
even if you were to work on an assembly line,
you wouldn't be able to do things as fast as them. Aren't people good at different things?
Don't talk back. The entrance exam is coming.
Universities don't have a cup-playing faculty, you know.
Of all that I've heard so far, yours seems to be the most futureless.
Okay. You may go now.
Jerita, 2.8. GO AND SEE THE WIDE WORLD
I know you are good at English. But for Thai, Science, and Social Studies,
But for Thai, Science, and Social Studies,
your grades are very bad.
Wow. Is this the sport the teacher's talking about?
Hey, I'm fine. You don't have to talk to me. If you want to practice your Thai, better find someone else.
No. I wasn't here to talk to you. I'm here to move the plants.
Hey, I understand, you know, Farang.
What's the deal with you?
Have you been teased all your life? You're so tense.
What's with you? Lonely?
A Farang who loves plants
talking to a guy who likes stacking is unusual.
You're weird, you know?
We're both weird. That's why we're here talking to each other now.
If I played football or basketball like the others,
I wouldn't be here playing alone like some weirdo. I have myself to blame.
You wouldn't be weird if you're in the right place.
Like this plant,
if it's placed in the shade, it'll die.
Exposing it to sunlight, it'll grow in three days.
I hope there will be a place like that for stacking.
If you love something, it will take you somewhere.
You know. My uncle has a flower pot factory. He's now filthy rich, who would've thought?
Your speech is way cooler than the teacher's.
Why don't you become a guidance counselor?
If you need help with anything, just let me know.
And…
what about you?
What do you want to do? Maybe I can help in exchange.
I… I don't have a special dream.
I'm average. A normal person.
Normal? Like… graduating, get a job, get married, have kids, own a house?
Well, I guess so.
I think you just haven't found your dream yet.
Actually, you aren't average.
How?
Your special ability is that
you're kind.
Kindness is a special ability? Can I use it to get into uni?
Well, it's not like everyone talks with me like this.
It isn't easy to find a kind person.
Sure. Thanks, then.
It's not like everyone talks with me like this either.
Well… if I come up with something I need help with, I'll let you know.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Jay.
I'm Kao.
Damn, you've distracted me, but somehow I can play faster.
Want me to explain how to play it?
Sure.
It's about stacking the cups up and collecting them as fast as possible.
But what I've been aiming to do is to compete.
In competition, there are a set of three, and of six…
When a plant is in the right place at the right time, it will grow quickly.
You can't see it. You will never see it.
It's because the speed of 0.001 second
is the speed at which the eye can't see. It's a speed when spoken of, no one understands.
When you come to your senses, you've already lost or won.
Sport stacking
is genderless…
doesn't care about age…
overlooks nationalities.
We're enemies for 0.001 seconds.
It is a sport that depends on you and your hands. No one can help you.
Speed without any pattern. Meaning?
It's like when you untie the rubber band, the brain will find the pattern to untie it.
Keep doing it and you'll be able to do it faster because the brain remembers the pattern.
But this kind of speed doesn't have a pattern.
It's absorbed. It's above any thoughts.
And… what can I do to help you?
Oh, well… help…
stay and keep me company.
What about as my girlfriend?
Staying with him might be the only way that an average person like me can help out.
In my country,
when you don't study at a university like the others, it's like throwing out your rice cooker.
Whenever you become a part of something special, you will feel like you're also special.
For me, his world is something beautiful.
I want to see it growing.
Here.
Thank you for staying with me, Jay. I freaking love you.
Not from winning.
But if I break a world record, I'll get money from the sponsors.
I hear they pay out in dollars. The reward can last for two years.
So, if I can practice and keep breaking the world record,
then stacking can become my career.
Jeremy from Austria, 4.753.
If I want him to be faster than 4.753, I think just being his girlfriend isn't enough.
Just you wait, Jeremy.
Kao! Come down and move the car. There's no parking space for customers.
It's okay. Keep playing. I'll take care of it.
He once said that my special ability is kindness.
Mom, I'll move it for you.
Jay, the keys.
Kao!
The sun's out, hang the laundry for me.
4.861, Jay!
4.861, Jay. It's 4.861. I really am faster.
If an accountant like me is able to help him be a millisecond faster,
I'm happy.
I'm happy for you.
Kao… move the car.
Jay did it already, Mom.
Sorry. I forgot.
Jay. With the conditions and the situation that we are dealing with,
I think there is something very important that we both need now.
The next level.
Don't tell me…
START AT 5.99 MILLION
Six million. Split the mortgage.
Well… I have some money,
but do you?
Kao! Buy some crispy pork belly for me.
Here is my source of capital.
When I win, I'll return twice as much to my mom.
I'll go home and think about it.
Aside from his improved stacking speed, our relationship has sped up like skipping up steps.
Welcome.
Take a look around first. If you're not satisfied, you can let me know.
Our living room uses the Empathy Design system.
We did research with actual families before designing it.
The rooms upstairs interlock with the ones downstairs. You can see into them.
Would you like to take a look?
This is the kid's room, suitable for both a boy or a girl.
It's the best corner of the house.
And most importantly, it's exceptionally quiet.
Mr. Win, please take a look first.
But you'll need to hurry because this is the last house we have now.
I'll give you the answer tomorrow. I think we'll take it.
JAY: WHERE ARE YOU NOW?
KAO: YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF IT. I TRUST YOU. LET ME PRACTICE FIRST. ANOTHER 0.001 SECOND IS COMING.
I'll take it.
You might think I'm crazy. But have you ever fought over pre-ordering stuff or buying stocks?
I must have seen some kind of future here.
This is the kid's room, right?
Okay. Great, it's like getting a free room. We're not having kids anyway.
What should we use it for?
Well…
this room is… for you to play cup stack. This is the quietest room.
Ever since that day I found that the essential thing to stacking
isn't just hands or cups. But it is a good environment.
This is the future.
I knew I could count on Jay.
This is clearly heaven.
It's like an arsenal of power, complete with everything to enhance speed.
Clean air without any dust. Nature.
And most importantly above all else, here, we can control any sound and any drama.
Jay, don't take a bath!
Jay, don't flush!
Hey, today…
Thanks.
I broke it.
I broke it.
Jay, this house is our new weapon.
May I inform you with respect, ma'am.
This is my future, the one you told me I didn't have.
This is the world sport stacking championship.
This is my home.
I wish for you to continue working hard.
The next level.
If we love something, it will take us somewhere.
Yam. Are you free tomorrow? I have to attend my kid's school event.
Oh, you aren't free? Yes.
I want to watch a movie.
This means our house is a competition court.
This means our house is a competition court.
Jay.
Do you remember, you once told me
if we love something, it will take us somewhere?
If I can really win this round,
let's find a way to move there and never return.
Is that good?
Damn, he scared me.
Why was he hyped up like that?
When you're really into something, you'd be hyped up about everything.
Don't you remember when you were about to slap that girl over sale items?
Damn. Just like Iron Man fighting Captain America.
This is the most important match for him.
To move up to another level, we need a good plan.
Jay. Can you take this too?
Thanks.
I want to make it as smooth as possible.
Kao, our favorite ice cream shop…
Oh.
That's right.
Our favorite ice cream shop opened a new shop around here. I'm so happy.
Because he trusts me,
I want to do the best I can.
His smile still always gives me happiness.
Caterpillars.
Damn it.
I know how he gets that 0.001 sec faster.
So, I have to be as silent as possible.
Oh, she stopped. Probably nothing.
I once wanted to go to America.
It should be good.
Actually, I don't like cold weather.
But I heard it isn't that cold over there.
Anything, as long as we're together.
If we love something, it should take us somewhere nice.
Hello. Do you ever buy stuff you didn't need,
Hello. Do you ever buy stuff you didn't need, but still buy it anyway?
What is it?
You found a shirt at 70% off, huh?
Don't stress yourself out. I'd buy it too.
You're quiet. I don't think it's a shirt anymore.
What did you buy?
I found it so cute.
I couldn't help it, so I bought them all. I have no idea why.
Now, kids' stuff on Facebook Ads keep popping up. Who the hell knows where they come from?
Jay. You can trick anyone,
but you can't trick Mark.
Actually, I'm not surprised at all.
You love taking care of your plants, your boyfriend.
You love anything and everything.
You're such a mother. You were born to be one. Don't you know yourself?
Hey.
You're already 30.
What you want or don't want, you need to talk about it.
Isn't it being dramatic?
It is. But shouldn't he hear your side?
But if I tell him, he'll lose his focus. He'll play slower. Then how would I be happy?
Jay.
You're kind to everyone. Don't forget to be kind to yourself too.
Stop doing a voice-over to soothe yourself when you're unhappy.
From my experience,
hurry up and do whatever it is you want.
Our ovaries aren't very kind to us.
Every hour,
an egg disappears.
There's still time, right?
You won't be born, kiddos.
SPORT STACKING STORE AND SCHOOL OF THAILAND
See? Tearing down the wall of 4.7 seconds isn't easy.
But it's not that you, you, or you can't do it.
I know that teaching you guys
I know that teaching you guys is like producing weapons to backfire on me, right?
But I'm more than happy to teach you. So, the first rule I'm going to teach everyone is,
listen really carefully, sport stacking is a sport using the measurement of seconds
sport stacking is a sport using the measurement of seconds according to your speed. It has nothing to do with your age.
There is no concept of child or adult, senior or junior.
That's great.
Kao, bruh.
Pai-Liu, right?
Great. That's great.
Everyone listen up.
This is an example of burning determination.
Great. I'm ready to spend all the time in my life
I'm ready to spend all the time in my life to take you down.
Great!
Of course, great. Kao, bruh.
Is… is this your child?
Media really influences the youth. I won't allow her to watch John Wick anymore.
Don't blame the media, ma'am.
I've transferred you the money for the class. Tell Jay to check it.
So? We'll have to say goodbye soon, huh?
Be patient, Por. We have another two months. The tables of the game can turn anytime.
I'll still have to practice more when I get home.
You've been playing for so long and still can't break 4.7.
There are only two months left. I bet that you will win. I'm opening a betting pool.
Dude, you never know.
This time I'm playing against kids around the world. Who knows how many kids are practicing while I'm sleeping.
Result speculation is my special ability, you know.
You'll shudder if the tables turn.
All right. The tables have turned. You're not the world's fastest anymore.
4.699.
You've got two more months left.
Edward D. Deluza. A 10-year-old Colombian.
His dad works in logistics. His mom is Nigerian. She owns a big orchard.
He has never competed officially because he started playing sport stacking just last year.
But as of late, his speed has been picking up
because it's summer break there and he's at home all day.
So, with every second that passes, Edward is able to develop himself all the time.
What's his house like? Lots of plants? A cottage in a forest in Colombia.
It must be a community, very festive and loud music. Silence starts at 2:00 p.m. Hits the sack at 9:00 p.m.
Damn, and what about nutrition? Mineral water from the mountains. Fresh plums from his garden.
What about sleep? Nine to eleven hours per day, all supervised by his mom.
But what worries me the most is…
he'll never have back pain.
Damn terrifying. The power of teenagers.
And, I want to tell you that his idol…
is you.
Even if he's my fan or a groupie,
I can't let him win.
Remember…
-Hey. -What?
Could you spare some time? I want to ask you something.
-Is it important? -It is.
Is it important enough to wait a minute? I'm not ready to listen now.
-What if it's not important? -What?
If it's not, then let's talk later, okay?
Well, right now, my record of 4.7 seconds has been broken.
And the one who broke it wasn't me. The five seconds we're spending now is terribly long already.
If there's anything that needs to be done, you can go ahead and do it.
I trust you. Just choose what you think is best. Thank you.
The next level.
I'll take care of it for you.
In the best way.
Just 0.002 apart.
Upgrading his level this time will be the most critical for him.
But he will have to overcome it.
This is the best way for the both of us.
The two of us will upgrade our levels together.
Jay, don't shower now.
Jay, the pump is noisy.
They're empty.
No one has filled them up.
I can't. I can't let drama into my life now.
You can stay at my place for as long as you want. No worries.
You're acting like you've left your eight-year-old at home alone.
Come on, Jay.
Concentrate, will you?
Focus on your goal. If not, you won't be able to continue.
You did the right thing. Letting go of your hand is the quickest way he'll learn.
He's about to bow down to the pump.
Por, I'm doomed.
What happened?
The pump is running nonstop. It's also heating up.
-Jesus, where is Jay? -She's gone.
Gone? Gone where?
I don't know. I can't know right now. If I do, my speed will surely drop. What should I do? The pump's been like…
Hey! Calm down.
-Did she take your favorite stack cups? -No.
-Did she take your favorite stack cups? -No. Did she take your hands?
-No. -And did she take your house?
Well, see?
Okay? You can keep playing, right?
Calm down. Every problem can be solved. It must start with yourself.
What are you talking about? It sounds familiar.
Okay. Let's do this. Try turning off the main water valve.
Shit. This is The Da Vinci Code.
Okay, whatever. No need to fix it. Go buy a new one.
I want to buy a water pump. What kind, sir?
Inverter or non-inverter?
What do you mean?
An inverter pump is different from the normal ones mainly in two ways.
It saves electricity. It uses up 35% to 55% less electricity.
The inverter system is able to control and adjust the motor speed to be compatible with output needs,
the motor speed to be compatible with output needs, so it uses less electricity.
What do you mean? Then you need Summai, sir.
I'll take you to the cashier. Do you need a company invoice?
SUMMAI AUTOMATIC WATER PUMP BEYOND IMAGINATION POWER
You're closing the sale too fast, I don't trust you.
Siraya.
Come over here. Come and explain to him.
Kind sir. Let's talk, one friend to another, okay?
Let's talk, one friend to another, okay? Don't think of me as a sales rep. Actually, the motors inside are all the same.
Other brands only have a one-year warranty.
But Summai gives you five years.
If you buy it right now,
I will give you a great deal. I'll give you an employee discount.
If you leave the pump to heat over a long time, it might start a fire, sir.
Well, it's up to you, kind sir.
In the water pump universe,
I'm just a virgin newbie.
This is my speed when my head's flooded with pump reviews and the slyness of the sales reps
who only think of gaining profit without thinking of the consumer.
Summai is good.
Summai is bad.
Summai is good. Summai is bad.
Summai is good. Summai is bad. Summai is good. Summai is bad. Summai is good. Summai is bad.
Summai is so-so. Oh? Summai is good. Summai is bad. Summai is good. Summai is bad.
At a certain point, you will realize that you're just a worthless Gen Y.
The speed you got is just virtual speed
like a dream at a retirement home at 4:00 p.m.
Summai is good. Summai is bad. Summai…
So, does it need to be inverter or non-inverter?
And this brand, Summai, can I trust it?
I give in.
I give in to everything, Jay. Whatever you want to rant about, just do it.
You're going to listen, right?
I don't want to go to America. I want to have--
Stop!
The caption is savage. Let's not click "see more."
Hey. Are you being sarcastic?
I'm not being sarcastic.
GOAT.
She closes all doors like this. This is clearly a war with God.
I'm furious. My ears are red. My foot keeps shaking.
Farang, why are you so cheeky? Farang knows what I'm like and still does this to me?
Farang knows what I'm like and still does this to me? Farang knows my weaknesses.
Farang knows even if I don't listen, when I go home, I still can't play.
Farang, Farang, Farang…
-I don't want to go to America. -Stop! -I don't wanna… -Stop!
Don't you see?
Go away.
Damn it. Couldn't jot down any shit.
What? You've never seen people fight?
In the world of sport stacking, we still need many players.
I can't allow Jay to monopolize me.
Oom-Im. You know how to do housework? Want some extra money?
This question is against child labor laws.
-What's your name? -What?
Wha… Stop!
-What's your name? -Metal.
-What can you do? -Everything.
See, it's making noise. And not only that--
Stop making a fuss.
Keep still…
and listen.
It's not the pump that's broken.
It's the sprinkler.
Who are you?
Here, I might be just an ordinary housekeeper.
But in my village,
everyone always calls me
the "Ancient One of Utilities."
I'm going to survive.
Metal, I choose you. I'll leave it to you.
Edward.
I guarantee I'll make Liam proud.
The left ovary has…
eight eggs.
The right side has seven.
A total of 15.
Thank you so much, Doctor. You're welcome.
Hello.
Hello.
You still have some eggs left. Your visit has come at a good time.
The older you get,
the less they are both in quantity and quality of the eggs.
Here's a brochure.
The expenses in harvesting the eggs are 180,000 to 200,000 baht.
And another 40,000 annually.
One more advanced step is
some people want to have kids, but don't want a husband.
They fly to Europe to buy sperm from a sperm bank there.
You can do that too.
The next level.
Breakfast is served.
Shit. It tastes better than Jay's.
Metal, remember this. Presidents come and go, but the Supreme Court goes on forever.
Okay.
Mr. Kao.
I think…
to be even more complete,
you should have a driver.
It will be easier for you when you go teaching.
Really? And an English tutor.
So you have a better accent when you go there.
Great strategy. Well thought out. You're much more than a maid.
Go get them.
I'm Kang.
I'm good at driving. I know all the directions.
I'm Woo. I graduated from UCLA. Please let me help.
I don't need Jay anymore.
Is Jay the old maid?
I'm allergic to cow's milk. Why didn't you tell me?
Bully?
Really?
Jay.
Can you not leave me?
Even if I don't leave you,
if you win and go to America, you'd still have to leave me anyway.
I'll help you for the last time.
I'll waste a bit of your time, but I'll tell you everything you need to know.
After this,
no matter where you are, you will survive. When it's done, we'll go our separate ways.
Which one isn't cow's milk?
Ask someone else.
Pretend I'm not here.
Uh, excuse me.
Well, I… I can't drink cow's milk. I'm not sure which one I have to buy.
If you can't drink cow's milk, why not try drinking buffalo milk?
Are you making fun of me?
BUFFALO MILK
What are you filming?
An elementary school kid learning how to buy milk.
Did you put the hair here on purpose?
Huh? There's…
Normally, there isn't any hair clogging the drain.
You're exaggerating. Have you ever noticed anything? Get to it.
Shit. Feels like a coming of age.
Wow.
Respect.
You used your hand.
I just use my foot.
Why… didn't… you… tell me?
Is it normal to get a sore neck while washing the dishes?
Yes.
But if you get yourself a step stool and rest one foot on it, it helps.
Is it normal to get back pain while doing laundry?
Yes.
But?
But if you don't let it pile up and do the laundry often, it won't ache.
Is it normal to get shoulder pain while hanging clothes?
Yes.
But?
But you have to endure it.
Tell me when you're done, and I'll come up for a nap.
Hey.
Are you the old housekeeper?
But you know, right? I'm the current one.
I'm his ex-girlfriend.
Hello, Miss.
Metal, help me!
Just shut up and do it.
Isn't the weather lovely today?
Who are you? What's with all these people?
This is the driver. This is the English tutor.
-Hello. -Hello.
You brought your relatives here to work? Do I look Korean?
Let's just say,
no need.
The two of you don't have to come back anymore.
Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang, Mr. Woo, don't leave me!
I love you!
You've got to do it now.
-Hey, are you crazy? -Don't you see?
Jay.
-I'm scared. What if I pee myself tonight? -Stop fighting! Let me help.
This isn't the kind of help I needed! Have you switched sides?
Jay, I can't fry it. It's hot. -Please. -You can't do that?
-Please. -You can't do that?
It's about to burn. If it's overcooked, it won't taste good.
I can eat overcooked eggs. And I don't have to eat any now!
This is the hardest.
Hey. Normally, there isn't any dust, right?
There's me, so there's no dust.
Why is this world full of dust like being in a time loop? Why is it never-ending?
Dusting out the niche builds up your tolerance tenfold.
Keep doing it.
I'll have to tell you about bed bugs. America also has them.
What's wrong?
I told you to water the plants every day. Why couldn't you do it?
Hey, just…
calm down.
I…
You scared me. I thought something happened.
We can buy new ones. It's just dead plants.
When I love something,
I don't let it die.
Didn't you know?
Every plant that I've taken care of, none of them have ever died.
I'm telling you,
if I could've taken them all, I would've done so. I wouldn't leave them like this.
I won't let the plants die anymore. I promise.
This one uses two parts soil, one part sand.
I don't like sand.
It's coarse,
rough, irritating, and it gets everywhere.
Do you think I like it?
Fair enough.
Pao's Gas Shop, 088-979-7851.
The Rescue Foundation…
1418.
What the hell? If I die, am I supposed to call the rescue team myself?
It's not like that. Just in case, like if a snake comes into the house,
Just in case, like if a snake comes into the house, they can take care of it.
If you finish this course, you won't die.
Living in either America or Venezuela, you'll survive.
As for the other stuff, I'll jot it down for you.
A whole week has gone by.
Are you the only one who lost a week?
Your back aches, right?
Want me to stick a pain relief patch on?
That'd be nice.
Thanks.
Well, when you do these chores, do you ache a lot?
Yes.
And… what did you do?
Nothing. It's normal to ache.
Sticking the pain relief patch on the back can't be done alone, right?
Some things in life can't be done alone.
Now I know. She's mad because she has to do the chores all by herself.
That "Break 4.7 without me is cooler" thing is just an excuse.
"I don't want to go to America." Nonsense.
Anyway, I'll use this chance to save everything.
Jay, I'm sorry.
I'm the one who told you to let me know if you need help with anything.
But… in the end, I'm the one who forgot.
If there's anything you want me to help with, feel free to tell me.
Here, sign this.
It needs two signatures. Then I can take care of the rest.
Sign? Sign where?
Aren't you going to read it first?
It's okay. I'll sign it now.
So you don't tire yourself trying to get me. It will make your life more convenient.
I want to help you out. Read it.
These documents, no matter how close we are, you need to read them.
Fine.
POWER OF ATTORNEY
TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO SELL PROPERTY AND THE BUILDINGS ON IT.
Which house are we selling?
This house.
Hey…
Are you selling it because you're mad?
I'm not mad.
I'm not a smart man, but I know what mad is.
I thought you were going to help.
Hold on…
So… This isn't just about you not wanting to go to America, right?
Just the tip of it, and you've already struggled like this. You don't want to know the rest of it.
It's good that you stopped me there.
-It's nothing you can do. -How do you know I can't do anything?
Okay, I give in. I will give up sport stacking then.
I won't go to America either. I choose you.
You can't just quit like this.
I've been with you for ten years.
I won't let it end like this. Understand?
If you quit now, all of this would be a waste of both of our time.
Oh, I get it.
The reason you're closing all doors is…
because you want to break up.
Actually, you can just tell me you don't love me.
Then… I'm going to finish what I said that day.
I don’t want to go to America.
I want to stay here. I want to have a home. I want to have a child. Can you do that?
Explain…
I… I don't get it.
If you have a kid, you'll have back pain. When sport stacking, you also have back pain.
I've never asked you to explain why you like sport stacking.
I see that you're happy and I get it.
So, is this really your dream?
Is that really it?
Yes.
Well, people can have plain, ordinary dreams, can't they?
Then… let's do it…
If you want to have kids…
we can't do it the normal way.
There are special positions. The timing must be right.
Babies aren't conceived in two seconds. Don't say stupid things.
If you ask me what I want you to help me with…
I want you to compete and win.
And let me go.
It's not easy, I understand.
I also think it's not easy.
Look at this.
You don't need to sign it. Why bother burning it?
I'm… not… selling.
At first, I thought I'd do it the right way.
You forgot, didn't you?
You left everything up to me.
Oh…
Damn!
Jay! Come back!
Fire! What should I do?
Jay!
Whoa. Actually, this situation is good.
It ended well. What do you mean?
It's a damn mess.
If you think about it, the situation is good.
It ended well. What do you mean? It's a damn mess.
If he won't let you sell it, then it means he loves you. Otherwise, why would he stretch things out?
If she wants to sell it, then it means she loves you.
I think this is such a beautiful breakup. Very mature. I like it.
Stretching it out is a waste of time.
I think you should get back to practicing.
I think you should get back together with him.
URGENT SALE
When did you announce the sale?
When you were convincing me. That's quick.
This way.
The atmosphere here is nice too.
There are a lot of trees.
-Umm. -Okay.
Lots of big trees. Nice.
Will the neighbors complain if we play music?
NOT FOR SALE
Right now, it's on the market.
-Okay. -I wasn't sure at first
and a lot of people kept calling, so…
-Come in. -Uh-huh.
I really like the common facilities here. The gym is big and not many people use it.
You really are slow.
I believe the missing 0.2 seconds, are gone because you're missing her.
Can't you multitask?
I'm probably not good enough.
I'm just saying. If you're any slower than this,
you'll run out of time.
Never mind. I'm going to lose anyway.
-I'm past my prime. -Hey!
You… must… win.
Why do you believe in me so much?
Do you know how painful it is when I tell people what I do for a living and they laugh?
Every time I ask for airfare sponsors for you,
they never help out because they don't believe it's an actual sport.
Liar.
I know you're working here because it's an easy job.
I see that you just trade stocks and resell stuff online. Tell me the real reason.
I made a bet with Oom-Im's mom for 50,000.
When you said you bet that I would win, it was a real bet, wasn't it?
I thought you would win. So, I put in everything on you.
I knew it. That's why you're really pushing me.
But in the deepest corner of my heart, I really want you to win!
All right. I'll practice more at home then.
SALE
Miss Jay said, "You want to mess with me? We split the mortgage, remember?" Sir.
Man. Is this really a sport stacking movie?
I haven't gotten to practice yet.
This must be half of the movie already. Stacking is only 20% of it.
The trailer shows furious plays. There isn't any in the movie.
I saw on Twitter that people have anticipated it.
And then there's the studio too. I promised them there'd be action throughout the movie.
Got kicked out of your house or what?
No, I…
I just want to come back and be with you. In case you need something, I can help.
In case you need something, I can help.
Take me to make my annual merit-making tomorrow.
Why are our daily lives filled with all these routi…
Where are you making merit?
Up there.
Can I wait here?
It's up to you.
In such critical times like this, if I'm going to get through this,
time management is the best path to winning.
Time management is over.
Are you okay?
Hey. Why didn't you tell me about your leg?
It's nothing much, so why bother other people?
Mom.
If it hurts, you don't have to go and make merit.
What's the reason for it anyway? It's a total waste of time.
The next life isn't real. You've been tricked.
I'm not making merit for my next life. I'm making it for you. So you can play with your cups faster.
This is the only way I can help you.
I've devoted so much to raising you, letting you play cups all day.
If you're not the fastest, I won't let it go.
Usually, I don't want to take up your time,
but this year, I really can't do it on my own.
Every year, Jay's the one who takes me. But this year, I couldn't reach her.
She must be busy, I guess.
From now on, if you need anything, just tell me.
I'm free.
Okay.
Careful.
After this, let's go straight home. Home?
After we're done, we'll go home, right?
What? This is the first temple, there's another eight left.
-Huh? -Huh, what?
I thought you said you were free.

Antoine, what are you doing, son?
I'm doing my homework and waiting for Mom.
Can you do it?
You've been sitting here for some time now.
I can't do it.
All right.
I'll… I'll teach you.
It's not hard.
Try again, five times one?
-Five. -Five times two?
-Ten. -Five times three?
-Fifteen. -Five times four?
Twenty.
What's five times five, son? How many times do I need to ask? If I knew, I'd tell you already!
What the hell? It's so damn easy!
I'll do it, punk. I mean… son.
That's all. Like I said, it's easy.
Although…
I might be stupid…
I might be slow,
thank you for trying to teach me.
It reminds me of the time…
when my dad used to be around.
He helped me with my homework every day.
But now…
there isn't anything like that anymore.
Thank you so much.
Let's have a look. -Wow, this room is really nice. -Right.
-Look, that's awesome. -That's right.
-It's really beautiful. -So beautiful.
What do you think?
The dressing room is to your liking.
It's humongous!
It should be big enough for your closet.
-Let's check out the sports club next. -All right.
Jay.
I'll…
I'll help sell the house too.
I already tried. I…
I'm sorry.
I really just can't do it.
When you say "chill," you can't really chill, believe me.
Hey.
Just a sec, Mom…
Mom wants me to move the car again.
All right. Let's talk later.
And this here…
is the living room.
It's…
comfortable.
There's a swimming pool outside.
It's…
nice and cool.
There are lots of lights.
They make everything bright.
Sir! If that's all you're going to say, how will you sell it?
Tell them the details. The house has an app.
-You have to do the hard sell. -What app?
A good house is one thing, but what's better is that here, they have the Smart World app.
If you want to pay the water bill, the electric bill, find a repairman,
the electric bill, find a repairman, fix the pump, clean the air conditioner,
do some gardening, receive your packages,
e-stamp your parking cards, talk with the guards at the gate,
look at the communal CCTV cameras, press the do not disturb button, or ask the neighbor to move their car…
All this can be done through this app. Here.
You have to try it. Try using it first.
This… This room is the children's room.
In case you have any in the future.
Actually, this house is pretty big. Do you live here alone?
Well, at first I didn't plan to live alone.
But in the end, I had to anyway.
So, it really is too big.
Dramatizing.
How could you ask such a thing?
Well, please have a look around first.
This house is really great. But I don't like the garden.
Then we can take it out.
As for the swimming pool, we can fill it in. You're afraid of water, aren't you?
Oh, you remember? You're so sweet.
As for the kid's room, we can tear it down. Aren't you going to sell things online?
We can turn it into a storage room or something. It's big.
Can we change it into a toilet? I want a large one.
It's called a bathroom or a shower room, not a toilet.
How do ordinary people get rich quickly?
-For what? -To buy a house.
-A new house? -The same one.
Are you high on something? You're not making any sense.
I'll tell you later. Stocks or crypto?
Wait, what?
If you choose crypto, you have to download a wallet first.
After you download the wallet, you have to fill up a form. It takes about three days.
They might or might not accept it.
You also have to choose how to pay, either by credit or bank account.
You have to pay VAT and tax. Choose your currency. Baht, pounds, US dollars, Aus--
I think… I better go back to practice to beat Edward.
This is my speed when my head's filled with all sorts of drama.
Hey Edward, don't you have anything else to do? The competition is all you think about. I'm not free right now!
This is how lonely this sport gets.
If you're slow, no one can help you.
Jay.
Can you please wait for me?
This room is 25.5 square meters, right?
Yes, but we have lots of large windows. So it feels like 35.
It's good for living alone.
But you said that you might have a family. We have other choices for you. Let's take a look.
That's all for today.
Go home and practice a lot.
The more you practice, the faster you'll get.
But if you don't get any faster,
it's fine.
You're agitated, right?
You're talking nonsense.
Huh?
How do you know?
How do ordinary people get rich quickly?
-For what? -To buy a house.
-A new house? -The same one.
Are you high on something?
I'll tell you later.
Stocks or crypto? Wait, what?
-You're nosy. -I'm not.
How do ordinary people get rich quickly?
-For what? -To buy a house.
-A new house? -The same one.
You guys like to think that
those younger than you aren't interested in these things.
Even if you're interested, it doesn't mean you understand.
Damn. The cold silent merciless stare,
how focused must Pai-Liu be?
She must have a warm family. A dustless home. A soundproof practice room.
Enough sleep. A green yard. No drama.
No love. And no boyfriend.
I was seeing a few people.
Is my voice-over too loud?
You're so fast, why not compete? Competing isn't important to me.
If you're good, there's no need to boast. I just show my friends.
This answer is like coming from a Jedi master, Li Mu Bai, Ip Man, Donnie Yen.
You don't have to believe me.
I just want to tell you
there's still hope.
Pai-Liu.
Will you teach me how to be as fast as you?
When you speak with grown-ups, look them in the eye.
Will… Will you please teach me how to play as fast as you?
Sure.
Pai-Liu. Did you stop watching John Wick and start watching Star Wars?
Shut up. Listen up. You have only 15 days left.
All right, the first thing I'm going to teach…
Damn it!
Get out! I'm warning you!
How can you lift the washing machine?
I was doing the laundry and saw a snake. I was scared, so I ran out.
Damn. I've only heard of people escaping a fire with a fridge. The wonders of adrenaline.
Mr. Kao, just go back in. I'll find a way myself. It's my duty.
-Let me take care of it. -Sir, don't.
It's dangerous. Don't waste your life on me.
Call 1418, The Rescue Foundation. They have snake-catching services.
Hello.
Yes. A snake is in my house.
Yes.
I think it slithered in.
-I can't believe this. -Yes.
This is what's called growth.
See, Pai-Liu. When you grow up,
there will be lots of things you have to think about.
Whether we have a competition or not, no one is interested.
Drama pouring in all the time.
Just look at today,
a snake came into the house.
It didn't bother to ask what we were doing.
But I couldn't ignore it either.
Right now, I don't want to win alone.
I want everyone around me to win with me too.
But do you know?
Ever since I've been thinking about such things, I haven't become any faster.
Do you know?
What I'm going to teach you is
even if it's only your hands holding the cups,
in this sport, we can play as a team.
If you see others, then others will see you.
Sometimes, starting from yourself might not be the answer.
It must first start from a structure.
Mr. Kao.
Since you saved my life, I want to tell you to go out there and fight for it.
I'll be your defense, and I won't ask for overtime.
I did some research on getting a quick home loan. Here, I'll explain it to you.
What's with all the people?
Kao.
The monk said you're down on your luck, so I got this as a lucky charm.
Right now,
you have eight hands and four brains.
Is that enough?
I never knew before that my housekeeper…
the school's manager…
and a noodle shop owner…
are really important players in my life as a sport stacker all this time.
Everyone, thank you. Really.
Metal, I don't have much time left. There are two weeks left before the long weekend.
And I don't believe it will be calm.
So, while I'm in this room and if something happens, I'm asking you to be the last defense. Please block them for me.
I'm asking you to be the last defense. Please block them for me. Yes, sir.
Mom. Right now, I need a lot of blessings. -You have to go make merit for me. -Sure.
I'll go free some cows right now.
As for Por… Please take my mom to free some cows.
If I win this competition, I won't need to take out a home loan.
When did you believe in this stuff? Whatever, I'll take anything right now.
Now, can we start?
Delivery!
Damn, it's started.
Keep on playing. I'll take care of it.
To the owner of 99/1, please attend the homeowners' meeting.
Keep on playing. I'll go.
Blackout.
Damn, Metal hasn't returned.
Sir. Hey. The lights went out.
But the other houses are fine.
What?
Did you pay the electric bill, sir?
It's been three months!
Damn it.
I'd like to pay the electricity bill.
If your electricity has been cut off, you have to pay it at the Electricity Authority.
I see.
-I'd like to pay my electricity bill. -Sure.
The staff will turn on the electricity before 6:00 p.m. -You have to wait briefly. -Can it be at 5?
-You have to wait briefly. -Can it be at 5? I'm not sure. It's all up to the staff.
Can it be at 5:15 p.m.?
It really is up to the staff.
-How about 5:17 p.m.? -5:18 p.m. then.
Wait a bit.
Man, a whole day's gone.
Hello, Jay.
Kao.
Today's the 28th already.
Thanks for still worrying about me.
But it's okay. I'm going to crush it.
Even if I only have three days left, I will win it.
No. What I meant was you have to buy mutual funds for a tax rebate.
Today's the last day. Have you bought any?
But today's only the 28th. The last day has to be the 31st.
They close for New Year's on the 29th this year.
The tax revenue department is faster than you think.
Why does life hate me so much?
The bank is still open.
You still have some time.
Metal.
It's over.
How can I make it? There are only two hours left.
I won't let it end so easily.
Let me help you.
I buy LTF funds every year. I'll help out with it.
Thank you.
I want to buy mutual funds.
There aren't any LTFs anymore for this year. There's only SSF.
It's a new fund that supports citizens to make more long-term savings.
-They can… -Damn.
Why does he look familiar?
This is different from LTF, which focuses only on Thai stocks.
Oh, my god, there isn't any LTF?
Damn it.
Give me some recommendations. I've come far. This is wasting my time.
My recommendation is to buy the funds on the app.
There's still a lot to learn about living, right?
When your electricity gets cut off, you can pay the bill via the app too.
Number…
Pai-Liu. I think life is getting back at me.
The more I try, the more it kicks back.
Exceptional speed can't occur in a normal environment, Kao.
Creativity without boundaries comes from restrictions.
Animals evolve by finding ways to survive.
You don't need to comfort me. I'm really going to lose.
Did you know,
how I got… that 3.876 seconds?
In that clip,
I was stacking while my parents were fighting in the living room.
They were going to get a divorce.
That day, it was so freaking loud and chaotic. I was stressed out, but I kept playing.
But that was the only time I was that fast.
Must you have so much grief to gain that speed?
Should I change sports?
And now what?
Do I need to find drama in my life? Where am I going to find any at this time?
Weren't you the one who told me
adults always have drama in their lives?
Honey, do you want that house?
What do you think?
Damn, I feel the drama.
I like it. Let's buy it.
Yes.
Sure. It's nice enough.
It's darker than the DC Universe.
Great.
That's the power source.
It's too dark, Pai-Liu. I can't overcome it.
They're going to buy it. I can't feel my legs anymore.
Don't be afraid.
Get up.
Your mom went to make merit for you. Did you forget?
It doesn't seem too superstitious, right?
You're quite straightforward, eh?
I don't know. I just know I'm doing what I can do.
Perhaps it will help.
We'd like to buy the life of a cow.
Amen. Wait!
Maybe we shouldn't buy it now. The economy is bad.
Even a better reason to buy. The price is really low.
It's like their house is burning.
Let's buy it.
True. You're right.
Should we buy one more? In case it's not enough. I think he'll need a lot.
Excuse me, one more, please.
Amen.
Wait! But Mom once told me if it's not necessary, then don't buy it. Let's not.
What are you worried about? I'm the one paying for it. I'll buy it for you.
-Another one? -Hello?
Hello, Kao.
Shall we go half each? I'm out of money.
I'll take the house.
I'll pay for it on the 4th before my wife changes her mind.
I don't know what's up with her. She has mood swings lately, like she's been possessed.
Oh, sure.
Thank you.
I'm really glad.
Okay. See you then.
Bye.
I just want to tell you that I sold the house already.
They're going to pay upfront, probably next week.
I'm happy for you. So, we can really break up now.
At first, I thought it'd be longer than this.
This is much sooner than I thought.
I want to tell you…
that…
you can give them my number.
I'll… I'll take care of it.
And the day we have to go to the Land Office, if you want to, come.
But if you're not free, then it's fine.
It's coming…
I can feel it.
Let the fire burn.
If you don't go any faster…
your house will be sold for sure.
I'm happy for you.
See?
You can do it without me.
Believe me.
I couldn't do it without you.
I'm sorry for…
always stealing your time.
I don't know how to give it back.
It's fine.
No matter what, it was a good time in my life.
I don't regret it.
I'm sorry.
Before I got here… another person who came to look at the house…
had just paid for it.
Which means…
I'm not selling it to you, sir.
Who bought it?
What's wrong with you? Is that possible?
Oh… I'm sorry.
Can I have a word with you for a second?
Please.
Well…
I'm really sorry.
I sold the house with my ex
and there must have been a miscommunication. -I-- -Honey.
-I-- -Honey.
I'm sorry.
-This is a freaking waste of my time! -I understand.
Honey.
You have to teach me negotiation skills. It looks useful.
Let's go inside. I'm ready to buy.
It's too big for you to be living alone.
Trust me.
Save your money and buy some other place. Then you find one for me.
Sure.
What are you looking for?
I want a house where the front door doesn't match the house.
The bedroom floor has a burn mark.
The bedroom smells like pain relief patches.
I want a house with plants that are in front of me when I do sport stacking.
I want a house that when I'm in there, it reminds me of when we were together.
If you find one, I'll sell this one, okay?
After today, we probably won't see each other that much. But if one day, you're tired,
or bored,
you can always come to visit.
Don't think of it as my house.
Just think of it…
as our home.
Your house? Our home? What? I'm confused.
Whatever. Just drop by sometime when you're free, Farang.
Well…
Before I leave,
I've been wanting to tell you this one thing for a long time, but I've never told you.
But… I think it's time.
-I also love you. -You snore.
Sometimes it's so loud, I couldn't sleep.
At first, I was afraid to tell you,
but just in case you live with someone else and you aren't aware of it.
Go see a doctor when you have time, okay?
Can't we have a sentimental ending? -I think this is very sentimental. -Sure.
-I think this is very sentimental. -Sure.
Let's go.
LAND DEED
FOR MR. PHUKAO BINKRAI AND MS. JERITA RITHTHUMRONG
FOR MR. PHUKAO BINKRAI
This is the level I didn't want to complete.
This is also the level I didn't want to complete.
But… I have to thank you, Jay.
I also have to thank you, Kao.
In the end, our homes are in different places.
But I feel like Jay is still nearby.
Even if we're a quarter-mile away or halfway across the world,
Jay has never left. She will always be with me.
Because we're family.
Hey. We'll have to say goodbye soon, huh?
Well…
I guess so.
So, I wanted to come and say thanks.
It's fine. You already paid me back.
One sec.
Hi, Oom-Im's mom.
I got the money transferred already.
I've got a headache…
having to find a new teacher, and I'm not sure who to ask.
Is there an age limit? This sport is about numbers.
No gender. No age.
Great. I know someone. I'll ask her. She's good at teaching.
Do you want to teach sport stacking?
Sure. Bruh.
Is today's temple far?
No. But we're going to several places today.
Hey, everything is in order, right? Thanks a lot.
Metal really is good. Whichever temple we go to, she has everything prepared.
But… you'll have to take care of snakes for her.
I'm just kidding.
Well…
I…
Thank you so much, Mom.
Sure.
Let's go.
-Thank you. -No prob.
-Mom. -Yes?
This is… Mr. Kang.
-Hello. -Hello.
Hello, ma'am.
Let's go.
Thank you.
-You go sit in the front seat. -Okay.
Thank you.
Ever since that day…
I never went back to that house again.
On some days, I wonder… what he's doing.
Can he change the bedsheets?
Can he do the laundry?
I hope his back doesn't hurt while washing the dishes.
I hope he can do everything that I once taught him.
And I hope that the plants are still alive.
But if I think about it again,
I believe he can do it.
And no matter how many other levels there are, he'll be able to complete them all.
Now…
I'm ready for the sequel.
I promise. I'll sport stack for the entire movie.
I know how to do everything. Do the dishes, do the laundry, mop the floor.
From now on,
it's going to be… furiously fast!
METAL! THIS PLANT IS WATERED ONLY IN THE MORNING.
[woman on phone] It's Saturday morning, honey.
Is it him?
News desk in London says he flew in from Heathrow last night.
My guy at the British consulate said he's not staying there, so…
[Jae] Those two on the door, they're Epstein's.
Those three guys,
I've seen them before.
Royal protection officers. If they're here--
Jae, the door.
[woman gasps] Guards.
[Jae] It's like she wasn't even there.
She must have been coming for years.
[woman] Christ.
She can't be more than 20 now.
Yeah.
Here we go.
-[camera clicking] -It's Epstein.
-[woman] That's him. That's Andrew. -[Jae] Come on, turn around.
-What? -[woman groans]
-[grunts] -Go, go, go!
What a lovely day.
Oh, here we are.
Okay.
Uh… okay. Okay.
-This isn't gonna work. -[woman] What isn't?
Change of plan.
[woman] Jae, talk to me.
I'm improvising.
Bear with me.
Oh God.
-Jae? -Not now.
Jae, are you there?
I'm here. [panting]
♪ I gotta fly once ♪ ♪ I gotta try once ♪
♪ Only can die once ♪
[woman] Welcome, everybody.
I want to thank you all for taking the time out of your lunch.
All of us at the BBC face some incredible challenges.
Morning, George.
♪ Who told you You're allowed to rain on my parade? ♪
The world is changing.
We need to change with it.
Every year the BBC faces more and more competition in the news space,
and we must fight to remain relevant.
♪ One shot, one gunshot… ♪ -Has someone got my Nando's? -Oh, yeah.
-Has someone got my Nando's? -Oh, yeah.
Bloody dog!
Have we still got jobs, then?
Moody, stop begging! Come on.
Come here. Moody!
[newswoman] Never in my career have I felt BBC News is under as much threat as it is today.
It is our duty to respond.
So it is with great sadness
that I have to announce… some job losses.
We currently estimate these job cuts
to be in the region of 450.
Here we go. Here we fucking go.
I know it is an enormous number.
How to improve your news-gathering.
Sack all the journalists.
These cuts will be across all news departments.
And across all shows.
Thank you very much.
-Okay. Uh, focus. -[song ends]
We've heard what she had to say, and unless I missed it,
she didn't say anything about not doing our show.
-Well, that was bleak. -Manage to catch it? Did you?
Nine hours and 13 minutes from now,
we're on air. With what?
[woman] Follow-up on British arms sold to the Saudis being used in Yemen.
Yeah, we've covered that. What's the hook? Why today?
[man] Brexit. Fifteen rounds with Farage. One-on-one with Emily.
What would be our way in with Farage? Something new.
-[man] Frictionless borders. -Gets my juices going every time.
-I can get us Lupita for tonight. -The actress? Has she got a film out?
No. She wants to talk colorism. She's got a lot to say.
She's great. It's an exclusive. I think we should open with it.
Perfect for the second half. Can't open with her.
Agreed. They don't decide our running order.
We opened with Emma Thompson on Weinstein. They saw that. That's why they want us.
Weinstein was a news story that day. Lupita may well be great, but it isn't news.
Second half.
So, Farage? Sam? Can you book him?
If you want Farage, Freddy, then it's simple.
You call up his PR. It's really not rocket science.
He'll be straight over.
[Freddy] That's your job. You're our booker.
And you do know we've just announced a few hundred redundancies.
Uh, okay, let's, uh--
The way I keep my job… Freddy, is by booking the people we can't just call up.
The ones other people can't just get.
The job where you waltz in late, then spend the morning
working out where to go for lunch with Piers Morgan? Last in, first out.
-You were here at 6:00. On the pips. Yeah? -What?
You know what that does? That puts us 16 hours behind the news cycle,
while I go out and find stories people actually care about.
No, we love Lupita, and we desperately want her.
We'd like to close with her and go huge on socials.
You know, that's where this really cuts through.
Okay, that's great.
Great!
Thanks, you're a superstar. Okay, bye.
It's not about me.
This is about
putting you wonderful young entrepreneurs
together with you
eh… slightly more mature investors.
So that together with Pitch@Palace,
we can make magic happen.
Now, I know you're all desperate to get talking to them,
and they're desperate to listen to your ideas
and make them into a reality.
So the best thing for me to do is to get out of the way
and let you crack on.
Before I do…
Don't tell my mum.
Maybe for the best no one came.
[Andrew] Ah, there we are.
All right, now say Pitch@Palace.
[all] Pitch@Palace!
Pitch@Palace!
Uh… I'd like it to be fair.
I mean, you don't mention Epstein
every time there's a story about Bill Clinton, do you?
[man] Bill Clinton isn't the Queen's favorite son.
[sighs] And if you had been here, then you would have seen for yourself
the… the wonderful job that… that he does with Pitch,
encouraging young entrepreneurs.
How young? These entrepreneurs? How young is young?
Piss off, Nick.
How do they get away with this?
That is why we have hired Jason. To manage this.
Time.
-It takes time. -Time? That photograph is nine years old.
-Sir, just-- -No.
-No quick fix to a story like this. -So you people keep telling me.
[Jason] And you are 100% right,
Your Royal Highness.
About what?
You've been dealing with this Epstein mess for nearly a decade.
You haven't seen him in that time, correct?
Uh… No. No, um… No, absolutely. It was, um…
Uh… December 2010.
Then my instinct is… you haven't had the right strategy.
Epstein, and the whole… Playboy Prince thing,
should have been put to bed a long time ago.
And I can make it go away.
But you have to let me control it.
Amanda?
Well, uh, Jason knows the press.
That's why we hired him.
I think he can help us.
I've, uh, put together a list of friendly journalists.
That's a… contradiction in terms, innit?
Invite them here, one by one, for tea.
They feel special.
You get to know each other, all off the record,
and slowly they realize you're a decent human being,
who is, by the way,
prepared to acknowledge errors of judgment.
Slowly.
It's always slowly. Always time.
I'm 60 next year.
And my mother, well…
none of us are getting any younger.
Jason's list of journalists.
What?
[sighs] Well, this…
This list. This… strategy.
We've been down this road before.
-Hello? -[Amanda] Hello, Sam.
It's Amanda Thirsk from the Duke of York's office.
Hi.
But we don't do red lines.
No questions off the table.
-Maybe just think on it. -I'll get back to you.
Great. Speak soon.
-[woman] Anything good? -Not sure. The Palace.
-Right, what have we got? -You know what I think?
For intelligent analysis, we're the only place in town.
Brexit again.
Sam, didn't you have something? The Palace?
Uh, not for tonight. But we have Lupita.
Great. Which bit of the Palace?
-Prince Andrew's private secretary. -Okay, what do they want?
Pitch@Palace. It's like The Apprentice,
only you get Prince Andrew instead of Donald Trump.
-It's not on television-- -Not Newsnight, is it?
Do you know Andrew's PS?
-No. -Did she reach out to you first?
[Sam] Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, everyone, keep looking, and let's talk again in an hour.
[Sam] I need a connect.
Uh, Jae Donnelly. A pap. Based in New York. Do you know him?
Great.
God… For Christ's sake.
Farage isn't available. We need somebody else.
Maybe even he's bored with it by now. Give me a minute.
-Who's on the phone? -Photographer.
Working for who? Paparazzi?
All your favorites, Freddy. The Sun. The Mail.
For Christ's sake.
[Sam] You know what? If we had half the instincts
and a quarter of the contacts for the average tabloid pap,
maybe we wouldn't be scrabbling around
for new ways to have the same argument every night.
So just, you know, leave it with me, yeah?
Coming right up.
Someone… Someone for Emily to really tell off.
-All the dinner parties in North London… -Sam.
-…say, "Did you see Newsnight last night? -Sam.
"Wasn't it amazing how Emily Maitlis said all the great things we all agree with?"
We're mistaking talking to ourselves for news, Freddy, and it's killing us.
-Stewart. -Mm?
I'm heading down to the studio.
-Come! Moody! -[dog whimpers]
I behave like that… insulting people in front of the entire office,
I mean, am I still here? Do I still have a job?
We have an issue
with Sam.
We? Who's we?
[scoffs] Well, I do,
Freddy, and now possibly Emily.
I'm not a snob, but she's very Daily Mail.
I'm not saying we can't cope with different opinions,
but she is…
she's too defensive.
[woman] Put the lights up a touch.
It's too cold.
I didn't say "turn back down."
[tech] Sure, but this is the correct set level for broadcast.
I'm aware of that. Back up.
Thanks for coming, Sam.
That level but warmer.
[tech] All right, okay.
I'll just have to switch some things around.
You understand the pressure we're under?
All of us. I've got enough fights on my hands
without having them in my own team.
Maybe you should speak with--
I am speaking to them, and I'm saying to them the same thing I'm saying to you.
-Help me out. -What about something like that?
Warmer, much warmer.
I'm trying to make changes. I want a broader audience.
That's how we survive. I've no interest in echo chambers.
I want different voices. I want tension.
And passion.
-Look, Emily, I'm sorry. -No, you're not.
You meant every word.
Not every word.
Don't think I don't know what people think about me.
The point is, if we're at each other's throats, then none of this is going to work.
[tech] So what are we saying?
No, warmer.
Okay, stop there.
-I like it. -[tech] Great.
Okay, understood. Anything else?
-I-- -[Emily] Three women and a whippet.
You wouldn't have seen that in a BBC studio when I started.
-[girl] Oh my God, n-- -Oh my God, that is--
-No, no, no, no, no! -No, no, no, no!
Sorry about the noise. I'm working. I might have to go without saying goodbye.
Thanks for calling me back. Anything good?
A Kardashian launching a new pair of knickers.
Gotta pay the bills.
-[chuckles] -All right, check your messages.
Some photos of girls I've taken over the years at Epstein's.
They are in there about an hour each.
They look very young.
[Jae] They come from an apartment block on 66th Street
owned by Epstein's brother, rented by Jeffrey.
It's a warehouse of girls.
He calls them his "nubiles."
This is still happening? It's industrial, Sam.
I've been in New York for years.
All I have to do is spend 24 hours outside of that place,
and you see them come and go.
How do we not know about this?
Because it's young girls no one cares about going in and out of a house.
And he's rich.
You know, he went to jail. Now he's out. Frankly, hardly anyone gives a shit.
And Andrew, is he in there often?
-Oh, back in the day, sure. -Any proof?
Of Andrew actually at Epstein's?
Other than the park picture?
Uh… no.
No, they're careful.
But I can promise you he was there.
-You know about Ghislaine Maxwell, right? -[clamoring]
-Andrew's friend? -No.
Well, you should. I've gotta go. Ghislaine. Look her up. I'll be in touch.
Well, you should. I've gotta go. Ghislaine. Look her up. I'll be in touch. Thanks.
-[girl 1] Guys. -[girl 2] What?
-[girl 1] Look at this. -[girl 3] Let me see.
[woman] Sam. Leave him a minute.
-A what? -[softly] Writing a poem.
Lucas?
So who is she?
I'm not in her class.
Listen, I… I know I'm your mum, and I'm biased and everything,
but you're very handsome, so you shouldn't--
No. Oh my. I mean my actual class.
-She's in the year above. -Oh. Well, I like your ambition. [laughs]
-[man] Chili sauce, yeah? The usual? -Yes, please.
You want a tip? How to talk to girls?
-Do I have a choice? -Not really, no.
You listen. Most people want to talk.
But most people are terrible at listening.
But you promised the British people there wouldn't be an issue.
And at the time, I followed that through--
-Were you wrong at the time? -I don't accept that.
Well, you were either wrong or making a promise you couldn't keep.
Which is it?
You described yourself as a man of principle.
You also guaranteed voters that border checks between the UK and EU
would be unaffected by Brex--
[Jae] Hi, this is Jae Donnelly. Leave a message.
Hi, Jae. It's Sam.
Uh… this photo of… Andrew
with Ghislaine Maxwell in London
and a girl, 17 at the time…
Uh, 2001. Virginia Roberts. Do you know anything about it?
Um… Give me a call when you get this. Thanks.
Bloody hell.
[woman] I want a selfie. [chuckles] Okay. Okay.
And a spoon.
Okay, bye.
-[driver] Don't tell me. -What?
Is it Phil the Greek?
Jugface?
I can't say.
It can't be Her Majesty. Her flag's not up.
Well, just as long as it's not that Randy fucking Andy.
Here we go.
Thanks.
-Hello. Morning. -Morning.
Yeah.
-Okay. -Thank you.
Follow the path. They'll let you in at the top.
Okay, great. Thanks.
[man] Good afternoon.
[Amanda] Earl Grey or chamomile?
[Amanda] We lose a fair few.
-Teaspoons. -[both chuckle]
They just seem to
go.
It's seen as a good thing.
-It means everybody wants a part of us. -Us?
[inhales] Well, I've been here for a long time.
It's like family. The day we don't need to budget for extra teaspoons…
And… would he be prepared to talk about that?
The theft of teaspoons from Buckingham Palace?
The future of the monarchy. What it will mean when the Queen dies.
[quietly] We don't talk about that.
Too painful? For a favorite son?
One thing about Her Majesty,
she is a very good judge of character.
So… what's she like?
-Who? -Emily.
Oh, well, she runs… [chuckles] She swims, she interviews.
She swims, she interviews.
Nobody's ever seen her eat. She's Superwoman.
-And the Bic. -Harry Potter has his wand.
Emily Maitlis has her Bic.
And Andrew? How's his judge of character?
He's a… a very loyal friend.
Too loyal for his own good sometimes.
Ghislaine Maxwell.
-She was a good friend, yes. -Mm-hmm.
Straight to the point.
There was some small talk,
but we're both busy women, and we both know why we're here, Amanda.
[whispers] Do you want to get a real drink?
Amanda?
Amanda?
Uh… she's out.
With Sam McAlister.
Who?
What do you think you know about me, Sam?
I know you come from banking.
A single mum.
I know that you've been doing this job for seven years,
and you have a problem that won't go away.
And I know that you're here
and Jason Stein isn't.
So?
So maybe it's you who wants to do things differently.
Or we're just looking at options.
-Or that. -[both laugh]
Uh…
Sorry, it's Andrew. He needs me.
Um, I'm only trying to be honest with you, Amanda.
I always am.
And you know it can't just be Pitch.
And like I said before, you wouldn't be here talking to Newsnight
if you didn't already know that.
[inhales sharply] But I'm not talking to Newsnight, Sam.
I'm talking to you.
And there is a red line.
Thank you for meeting.
[Andrew] You'll like this too. This is moments
[Andrew] You'll like this too. This is moments after I've just narrowly been missed by inches by an Exocet missile.
after I've just narrowly been missed by inches by an Exocet missile.
And as soon as it came, I'd… Out of the way, and I'd come down. I'd do that two times a day.
Out of the way, and I'd come down. I'd do that two times a day.
[woman] Must have been terrifying moments.
Oh, some of the worst.
And some of the best.
Those… Those… Those men, they… they-they really knew me, you know?
Well, there's no hiding in war.
From your shipmates. Um…
From yourself.
Do you ever miss it?
What, war?
The Argies were a lot less trouble than your lot.
Come on. Let's go for it. Let's do the tour.
[Jason] Newsnight? Newsnight?!
You saw that.
Can't… Can't you see how good he is with people?
How they like him when they spend time with him?
-That's the plan, Amanda. -Look, it's called charm.
Jason, you have to be in the room with it to feel it.
Television?
Look, it was just a meeting.
A meeting you shouldn't have taken.
Especially without me.
This is my job.
No, not now, Freddy.
-Did the liquid lunch go on the BBC tab? -[sighs] I was so close.
Really? Think you have special powers over a big beast like Buckingham Palace Comms?
It was just the two of us. Nobody else.
-And we were so close. -To what?
An interview. This Epstein story isn't going away.
Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's girlfriend, is one of Andrew's oldest friends.
Then they're not gonna talk to us about it, are they?
Sam, it's celebrity fluff, not Newsnight.
[Sam] It's not fluff. It's exactly what we should be doing.
I'm sorry, but we don't have time for you to spend
a whole day chasing a story that we're never gonna get. Not anymore.
We're meant to be a team. Why do you think you're so special?
This is the work.
All right? Today was the work because this story is only going to get bigger.
And when it does, we don't wanna be the first people making the call.
We wanna be the first people they call. And if I--
If I can't do my job the way it needs to be done,
then I don't think I can do this anymore.
Oh, Sammy.
[automated voice] Please leave a message after the tone.
Hi, Esme. It's Sam.
I was just calling…
Uh, could you…
Could you call me back when you get this? It's important. Thanks, bye.
You all right?
D'you know, I spend half my time
just absolutely terrified of getting sacked,
and the rest of it wishing they'd get it over with.
Why don't they see me as one of them?
-Maybe there's somewhere easier. -I don't want it to be easy, Mum. I just…
I just want it to matter.
[inhales] Lucas!
-Mmm… Night-night. -Night-night. Night-night. [kisses]
-Night, you. -Night.
Hello.
I spoke to her. Freya. That's her name.
Yeah. And what did she say? What did you say?
-Hello. -[chuckles]
What did she say?
Well, I thought maybe she hadn't heard me. But she did. And--
-[musical ringtone playing] -Yeah. Oh, one minute, darling. Wait.
-[musical ringtone playing] -Yeah. Oh, one minute, darling. Wait. One second. Hang on.
Jae?
How was the Palace?
I couldn't make it work. Epstein's a no-go.
Well, not anymore.
-What do you mean? -I'm at Teterboro. A private airfield.
Our friend Jeffrey's plane is due to land in the next hour.
And the FBI are waiting.
-Mum! Can you… -[car alarm chirps]
Can you stay one more hour with Lucas? That all right?
-Yeah, of course. -I'll be back before he goes to bed.
[Sam's mum] Take your time. See you later.
Hello?
You called me.
You said it was important.
Jeffrey Epstein is being arrested tonight. Sex trafficking.
Esme? Are you there?
So it's a news story now.
Right, let's start pushing the Palace.
Thanks.
All right.
Everything's changed.
Any moment now, you are going to get a phone call.
After that, a hundred more.
We have a few hours, at best, before the tsunami hits.
-I thought we could use it, both of us. -What has changed?
The FBI are raiding Jeffrey Epstein's home any moment now.
This red line of yours isn't going to hold, Amanda.
You can't go "no comment" on being friends with a pedophile
and expect everyone to love you, whoever you are.
-How do I know I can trust you? -You don't.
And you don't have to because I can give you an hour.
Yeah? And then it's up to him. Not you.
Yeah? And then it's up to him. Not you. Not me. Him.
An hour of television can change everything.
It's like magic.
[newswoman] US financier Jeffrey Epstein has been arrested today
on federal sex trafficking charges.
The disgraced billionaire has been accused of trafficking dozens of underage girls.
He was previously convicted in 2008
after pleading guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution.
How many times?
…will no doubt focus on Mr. Epstein's friendship…
How many times?
…the Duke of York, who previously claimed to have cut…
I'm sorry.
…all ties with Epstein in 2010.
Where does he go? Simple question, where does he go?
A clue.
He's a marsupial.
Roo. As in Kanga.
Put them together. What do you get?
-Rookanga. -Oh, go away.
Go away!
They have acknowledged the duke's friendship with Mr. Epstein in the past.
They have acknowledged the duke's friendship with Mr. Epstein in the past. They state that…
[Sam] If the prime minister needs to get this message across to voters,
you're going to need to send us someone people have actually heard of,
who can form sentences using more than just single-syllable… words…
…now has the very latest news.
The investigation surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's arrest
three weeks ago for child sex offenses
has today widened to include his friend Prince Andrew, the Duke of York,
as previously suppressed documents from a case in 2015 come to light.
Virginia Giuffre, 17 at the time of the allegations,
claims in newly released documents that she had sex with the Duke of York
on three separate occasions.
Twice in London, and once in Mr. Epstein's home in New York.
[female reporter] While Buckingham Palace continue to deny
these latest allegations against the Duke of York,
Virginia Giuffre told reporters outside a court in Manhattan…
It's not true.
I mean, none of it is true.
-…the deepening crisis surrounding Andrew… -[scoffs]
The morning I went away to boarding school…
Mummy combed my hair.
It was one of those tortoiseshell combs. Remember those?
I can feel it now, scraping across my head.
It hurt, but I… [sighs]
But I didn't want it to stop.
So Jason says… n-nothing changes.
We… hold our nerve.
Is that what you think?
Let's see how it plays out.
I'm supposed to be talking to Mummy about my 60th birthday.
She's got big plans.
[anchor 1] Mr. Epstein, arrested just over a month ago,
was found dead this morning
in his cell at the Metropolitan…
[anchor 2] He once counted among his friends Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew…
[anchor 3] He was in cardiac arrest and pronounced dead…
[anchor 4] …charged on trafficking dozens of girls for sex…
-[anchor 5] …six underage victims… -[anchor 6] …involving underage girls…
[anchor 7] …including Donald Trump, liked beautiful women…
[anchor 8] …categorically denied by the royal family.
[Esme] All across the world, every paper, every show on every news channel,
this is the story. The only story.
-Morning. -Morning.
Sam, I want it for us.
For Newsnight.
You got your foot in the door before anyone else.
[Sam] Amanda. Hi, it's Sam McAlister.
Please call me.
When you're ready to talk, we're here.
Her Majesty combing your hair on your last morning at home…
Yes?
[Amanda] You remembering it and talking about it…
Yes?
[Amanda] I think there's a reason for that.
I think you want your future back.
We both do.
Let me help you.
[man on TV] …relationship with Epstein will persist.
Now, of course, the duke, the Palace are desperate to move on from this issue,
but with today's news,
the prospect of that seems further away than ever.
No commitments, no promises.
-[Esme] But? -They've agreed to meet.
Right. This stays in this room, just the four of us.
If it leaks that we're even meeting, they could get spooked.
Sam, whatever you need, it's yours.
Actually, there was one thing. I think it will help a lot.
[Esme] Name it.
Emily.
I've never been smuggled into a palace before.
[Stewart] Keep it light.
-[Sam] Mm. -We don't scare him off.
We, uh… we play nice.
Be respectful.
Relax, I've got this.
How difficult can it be talking to the Queen's son
about his friendship with a convicted sex offender?
Good morning.
[Andrew] Hello, everyone.
I hope you don't mind, I brought someone along.
-Hello. -You know my daughter Beatrice.
Hello.
[Emily] I can't tell you what the questions will be
because I don't know myself yet.
But when I do know…
I still won't tell you.
But… they will be fair.
And no "gotchas," I promise.
"Will be"?
"Would be," I think you mean.
Were we to agree to do this.
And Pitch@Palace?
We'll discuss that, of course.
But… you know as well as I do,
that's not why we're here.
Epstein.
This is about honesty.
On both sides.
If I do an interview, it will only be one.
Uh, the question is, why you?
-[Emily] Stewart? -Well, um, Newsnight is forensic.
Um, it's tough, but never sensational. And so is Emily.
-And she's a woman. -And she's a woman.
And she's here.
Look, in my position,
with everything that's been, um… said,
and with the world as it is now, I…
It's hard to imagine how I can turn it around. Frankly. I mean…
It's hard to imagine how I can turn it around. Frankly. I mean… I… I have a lot of people telling me it's a mistake even being in this room.
[Sam] And yet here you are.
And I can promise you one thing.
You can't turn it around by staying silent.
You know how people see you, don't you?
Why don't you… spell it out?
Randy Andy.
Air Miles Andy.
This is sex, and girls,
and planes and private islands and money.
And, with respect, the public see these stories,
and they think, "Yep, I can believe that."
This isn't bad for your brand.
This is your brand.
"With respect"?
Sort of got a point. [laughs]
[Sam] Listen, I get it.
"Never complain, never explain." But I'm afraid those days are over.
Yes, everyone has a voice now.
Social media. Facebook.
Twitter. Everyone's having their say,
and what they're saying about you
is a lot… stronger than anything I just said.
-Have you seen Twitter? -No, I don't, uh, pay attention to that.
[Beatrice] I do.
A lot worse than what she said.
So I'm just saying that's the story,
and it doesn't change
unless you change it,
unless you tell us a different story.
Your story.
In your voice.
[Emily] Sam's right.
I mean,
I might not have said it quite so bluntly, but…
I don't understand why everyone's obsessed with my friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.
I knew Jimmy Savile so much better.
Thank you very much. Very nice to meet you.
Um, should we pop up and say hello to Mummy before the Commonwealth banquet?
Never ends, does it?
Um, Amanda will be in touch, one way or another.
-[Emily] Her mummy or his mummy? -[Sam] Fergie's not here.
She's abroad.
-So his mummy. -Okay, wow. Bloody hell.
Mummy might block it.
Yeah.
Christ, I'm tired.
Pretty punchy in there, Sammy. Nice work.
[Jason] Conditions, Amanda?
You… You discussed conditions.
I… I didn't agree to anything.
It… It's not like that.
Amanda.
What conditions?
The only thing that matters is that he is given the space to talk to us.
"Us"?
The nation.
Oh my God.
I can't do this.
-Mm. -No.
I'm out.
I understand.
If they agree, and if it happens,
it's 60 minutes.
"If it happens"? What could stop us?
Something high up. This is the royal family and the BBC.
People start talking about the national interest and make no mistake,
if we get this, and we pull it off, it will be front page of every paper.
But if we get it wrong, if we make mistakes,
if we don't get the tone right,
the story won't be him. It'll be us.
No, it won't.
It'll be me.
She's always right, isn't she?
Always.
What did she say?
She trusts my judgment.
[Sam] Great.
Amanda Thirsk called.
Thursday, 2:00 p.m. The Palace.
We're on.
Got 70 hours. Emily, you're spending them with me.
Stewart, you're producing. Sam, anyone who needs you, gets you.
Yes, is Fran there?
Yes, extremely urgent.
With the director-general? Which opera?
[Fran] When it's done,
nobody sees the cut until the DG and I have seen it.
Lovely to see you both.
Tony's keeping his options open.
Well, it's not over till the fat lady sings.
[Esme] So the question is,
what are we looking for?
A confession?
String of denials?
An apology?
No way he's confessing unless he wants to go to jail,
and we're not settling for an apology, so we go after him hard with the facts.
-Fine. So where do we start? -[Freddy] Mm.
July 15th, 2006. Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Harvey Weinstein
are at Beatrice's Victorian-themed 18th birthday party.
Epstein wore white with gold buttons and a chestful of medals.
His Florida home had just been raided by police.
Sorry, that's a lot to take in, in one go.
July 15th, 2006,
Epstein, Maxwell, and Harvey Weinstein
are all at Beatrice's Victorian-themed 18th birthday party.
Epstein wore white with gold buttons and a chestful of medals.
His Florida home had just been raided by police.
Sorry, that's a lot to take in, in one go.
That is fantastic. Nowhere to hide.
[Freddy] Andrew's tried to make it seem his friendship with Ghislaine
was the main reason he spent time with Epstein.
Problem is, it looks like she was absolutely complicit in so much of what Epstein was doing.
This painting of Clinton… That's the Lewinsky dress.
[Freddy] Yep. Epstein had it on his wall.
There was a life-sized naked doll hanging from a chandelier.
A massage room.
Soap shaped like genitalia.
You couldn't be anywhere near Epstein and not know.
[Sam's mum] You know Lucas can stay here tonight if you have to work.
No, it's fine. They don't need me anyway.
I don't believe that for a second.
Then why didn't they ask me to stay, Mum?
I bring in the interview, and they still don't want me in the room.
Sam, you know how this works.
People like us, we don't wait to be asked.
We do what we have to do.
Did they ask you to go after Prince Andrew?
-No. -No, they didn't. But you did.
Remember that.
And this interview,
does it matter?
Yeah, it matters.
Well, there you go, then.
Love you, Mum. [chuckles softly]
I love you too, sweetheart.
Hello.
[Amanda] Sam. Uh…
I hope it's not too early.
[Esme] And the 29th. And you've got, what, everything from the 17th of June?
[Freddy] That's right.
-Can you put those on a memory stick? -Yeah.
[Sam] Amanda called.
Is she pulling the plug?
South Drawing Room.
Two chairs in the middle of the floor. Six feet apart.
It's like a western.
Like a gunfight in a western.
-Right. -Huh.
All set?
[Esme] Emily.
What's wrong?
What if he just apologizes?
What if I lay out all the facts,
he doesn't admit to anything, but he does say sorry?
What if he's good, Esme?
Then it'll be great television.
Well, that's not why I'm doing it.
Well, why are you doing it?
Monica Lewinsky.
I feel like I let women down by not asking Clinton about her.
Sex with that woman was actually consensual.
She was 21. He was the president of the United States.
He got his life back. She got decades of vicious misogyny.
You push.
What?
If he's good, if he's saying sorry for what these girls went through,
then… lean in and ask him if he feels responsible as well as sorry.
[Emily] What if he says no?
Push again, with the photograph. Show him the picture. Here.
Here.
But this photograph… is you.
I don't believe I was ever there,
that I ever even went upstairs in that house.
Um… You don't recollect, Your Royal Highness.
Yes, of course.
So… it's a fake?
[Andrew] As I say,
I have no recollection of ever having been there
or even meeting that woman.
Ms. Roberts. Please don't ever say "that woman."
Ever.
-Oh, for heaven's sake. -I understand this is difficult.
And, of course,
you couldn't have been there on that date, correct?
You have denied, many times,
having even met Virginia Giuffre.
You have denied her extremely serious allegations
that she was forced to have sex with you
when she was just 17 years old.
Now, either this happened
or she's lying.
Which is it?
Bingo. Brilliant.
We got him.
Sam.
Tell me.
Nothing.
Tell me.
I'm going in there. You're not.
If you have something to say, I want to hear it.
It's just we offered him… space and time.
We offered him an interview.
Men like that hate it when they're not heard.
He'll want to be heard.
So the really big question… is what do I wear?
Black dress.
Simple, elegant.
Hepburn/Maitlis.
My knees.
You've got the best knees on TV.
I don't want people looking at my knees.
You don't want him looking at your knees. Actually, we do want him looking.
-That would be good TV. -[chuckling]
[Esme] Emily?
Go home.
I want you raring to go in the morning.
[Emily] 2006.
Epstein was convicted of trafficking girls as young as 14.
Yet you continued relations with him for another four years.
And yet you…
and yet you continued your friendship with him until 2010.
[panting] And yet you continued…
-[dog barks] -Moody!
That's great. Yeah, just in this room. All right. Through there.
Moody!
-ID, please, miss. -Yeah, um…
She's with me.
Thanks!
Thanks.
You chase them, you'll never catch them.
And then when they're ready to come, you won't be there.
He might walk out. If Emily's doing to him what I think, it's a strong possibility.
If he does, film it.
-Whatever he does, do not stop filming. -Stewart.
-Right. -Um…
Your Royal Highness.
[Andrew] Sure about this?
Little bit, um…
[woman] A bit of powder, Your Royal Highness?
-Sure. What's your name? -Cat.
-Okay? First question. -Yeah.
I want it to set the tone. Straight in. "Jeffrey Epstein was a child abuser."
"You knew that when you went to stay with him, didn't you?"
Only one answer to that. Already he's got nowhere to go.
[Andrew] No, this needs to be on the other side.
It's going through the opposite edge of the chair.
That way, it won't stick out.
-Oh God. -No, wait.
Let him be. We want him to be comfortable.
Trousers.
Just, uh…
Just… be yourself.
[Sam] That's not great.
Donal McCabe. He's from the Queen's press office.
[Stewart] We didn't agree to that, did we?
[Sam] With the Queen?
No. But by all means, take it up with her.
[woman] Sound speed.
[man] Set.
Your Royal Highness.
We've come to Buckingham Palace
in highly unusual circumstances.
Normally, we'd be discussing your work… -[Andrew] Mm. -…your duty.
We'll come on to that.
But today,
you've chosen to speak out for the first time.
Why have you decided to talk now?
Because there is no good time
to talk about, um… Mr. Epstein
and all things associated.
And we've been talking to Newsnight for some time
about, um, doing something around the work that I was doing.
And unfortunately, we've just not been able
to fit into either your schedule or my schedule until now… now.
Actually, it's a very good opportunity. I'm delighted to be able to see you today.
As you say,
it all goes back to your friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.
How did you first become friends?
How did you meet?
Well, I met through his girlfriend.
Back in 1999.
[whispers] It's too open. It's too easy.
[Andrew] I'd known Ghislaine since university. In the UK.
And, um, I didn't spend much time…
I suppose I saw him once or twice a year, perhaps maximum three times a year,
and… quite often, um, if I was in the United States and doing things,
and he wasn't there, he'd say,
"Why don't you come and use my houses?"
And I said, "Thank you very much indeed."
But it would be… a considerable stretch to say that we were very close friends.
But he had the most extraordinary ability
to, um… to bring… extraordinary people together.
And that's the bit that I remember.
It's going to dinner parties where you would meet…
What's she doing?
…academics, politicians…
She's letting him talk.
[Andrew] It was a cosmopolitan group of what I would call--
Did you trust him?
Yes, I think I probably did,
but, um…
Obviously, I don't go into… um, a friendship
looking for the… the wrong thing, if you understand what I mean.
I… I'm an engaging person.
I want to be able to engage.
Am I right in thinking you threw a birthday party
for Epstein's girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, at Sandringham?
No, it was a shooting weekend. A shooting weekend?
Yes, just a straightforward… straightforward shooting weekend.
But during these times that he was a guest at Windsor Castle,
at Sandringham, this shooting weekend… Yep.
We now know… that he had been
We now know… that he had been procuring young girls… for sex trafficking.
We now know that.
At the time,
there was no indication,
to me… or anybody else,
that that's what he was doing.
Absolutely no indication.
Flight logs for Epstein's jet.
The, uh, quote "Lolita Express."
PA, Prince Andrew, is a frequent flyer.
So is BC, Bill,
and GM, Ghislaine Maxwell.
Princes, presidents, and females.
The girls don't get named.
Just so our ducks are in a row when all of Fleet Street comes knocking.
Just for the record, you've been on his private plane.
Yes.
You've been to stay on his private island.
Yes.
You've stayed at his home in Palm Beach.
Yes.
So, in 2006, in May,
an arrest warrant was issued for Epstein
for sexual assault of a minor.
Yes.
He was released in July of 2010.
And within months,
you went to stay with him at his New York mansion.
Why?
Why were you staying with a convicted sex offender?
Now, I went to see him with the sole purpose of saying to him
that because he had been convicted,
it was inappropriate that we should be seen together.
I felt that doing it over the telephone was the chicken's way of doing it.
I had to go and see him and talk to him.
I went to see him. We had an opportunity to go for a walk in the park,
and that was the… uh, conversation, coincidentally,
that was photographed.
When I… I said to him, I said, "Look, because of what has… happened,
I don't think it is appropriate for us to remain in contact."
And by mutual decision,
we agreed to part company, and I left.
He threw a party to celebrate his release,
and you were invited as a guest of honor.
No, I didn't go.
Oh, in 2010.
There… Well, there… There certainly wasn't a… a party
to celebrate his release in… December, because it was only a small dinner party.
There were only eight or ten of us at the dinner.
If there was a… a party,
then I know nothing about that.
You were invited to that dinner
as a guest of honor.
I was there, so I was at the dinner. I don't think it was as you might put it,
but, okay, I was there. I was there at a dinner.
I'm just trying to work this out
because you said you went to break up the relationship,
and yet you stayed at that New York mansion several days.
I'm wondering how long--
I was doing a number of other things while I was there.
But you were staying at the house of a convicted sex offender.
It was a convenient place to stay.
So I've spoken to Panorama.
Virginia Roberts says the original photo was printed and date stamped
two days after it was taken,
and we have an affidavit from a witness in 2001
who saw the photo at the time.
-Freddy? -Yeah?
Thank you.
Yeah.
[Emily] One of Epstein's accusers,
Virginia Roberts,
made allegations against you.
In a legal deposition,
she said she had sex with you three times.
Once in a London house
when she was trafficked to you in Maxwell's house.
Once… in New York
a month or so later in Epstein's mansion,
and once on his private island,
in a group of seven or eight other girls.
No. [scoffs]
No to all of it?
All of it.
Absolutely no to all of it.
Are you saying you don't believe her?
She's lying?
That's a difficult thing for me to, um… answer
because I don't know
what she's, um, trying to achieve.
But I can tell you…
uh… categorically,
I don't remember meeting her at all.
I do not remember a photograph being taken,
and I've said,
consistently and, um…
frequently,
that we never had any sort of sexual contact whatever.
She says she met you in 2001.
She says she dined with you,
danced with you.
You bought her drinks
at Tramp nightclub in London.
There's a number of things wrong with that story. One of which is that…
I don't know where the bar is in Tramps.
Um, I don't drink.
Um, I… I don't think I've ever bought a drink in Tramps whenever I was there.
Do you remember dancing with her?
No, that couldn't have happened because on that particular date,
I was, um, at home. I was with the children.
And I had taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking
for a party, I think… round about 4:00, 5:00 in the afternoon.
Why would you remember that so specifically?
Because going to Pizza Express in Woking
is an unusual thing for me to do.
A very unusual thing for me to do.
Uh, stop. Um…
Can… Can we?
Please, um, I would like to go back.
I would like to make a… a specific reference to the date.
March the 10th.
I think it's perfectly clear. Do we need that?
I think we're rolling well, don't you, Emily?
-No? -No.
-She was very specific about that night. -Mm-hmm.
She described dancing with you.
-No. -And you profusely sweating.
Um, there's a… there's a, um… a slight problem with the sweating.
But… because I have, um, a… peculiar condition,
which is that I don't sweat, or rather I didn't sweat at the time.
And that would, um… Oh, actually…
Yes, I didn't sweat at the time,
and that's because I suffered
what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War
when I was shot at, and I simply, um…
it… it… it was almost impossible for me to… to… to sweat.
I wonder
if you have any sense of
guilt, regret, or shame
about any of your behavior
in your friendship with Epstein.
On balance…
could I have avoided… ever meeting him?
I don't think so,
and that's because of my friendship with Ghislaine.
[sighs through lips] Do I regret the fact
that he's quite obviously, uh, conducted himself in a manner unbecoming…
[Emily] "Unbecoming"? He was a sex offender.
Yes, I'm sorry. I… I was being polite.
I mean, in the sense that he was a sex offender. But, no, um…
Was I right in having him as a friend?
At the time,
bearing in mind this was some years before he was accused of being a sex offender,
I don't think there was anything wrong… then.
The problem was, after the fact, that after he had been convicted…
-You stayed with him. -I stayed with him.
And that's the bit that, um, as it were,
I kick myself for on a daily basis. [chuckles]
Because that… it was… it was not, um, becoming of a member of the royal family,
and we… we try to uphold the highest standards and practices,
and I… I let the side down, simple as that.
Is there anything you feel has been left unsaid
that you would like to say now?
No, I don't think so.
You probably dragged out of me most of what's required.
I'm gonna go.
I have a biker downstairs. The memory cards. Both copies…
Now, would you all like a tour?
Some stills?
Ah. Yes, of course. Um… Tell you what, two birds, one stone.
You take your snaps while I show Emily around.
[distorted] Wasn't he wonderful?
[softly] Wonderful.
You know, I thought that all went very well.
Like a walk in the park.
Expecting a car, madam?
Uh… Uh, no. Thank you.
Um… I think I'm going to walk. But thank you.
-I think I might be sick. -[both chuckle]
Emily. That was…
That was him… right there. You did it.
We did it.
Thanks, Sammy.
[Stewart] How are we doing?
Twitter teasers are nearly ready. When do we go live?
[Stewart] I'm gonna talk to the DG about that now.
She had her man in the room when you shot the interview. He recorded it. Yes?
Could she stop it going out, Tony?
Well, she is the Queen. I mean, I'd have to take the call.
We want to trail it on Friday night after the show, live.
With Emily?
Of course. With teasers on socials afterwards.
[Tony] I'll tell the Palace we're broadcasting on Saturday night.
Wait for me to get back to you.
How long?
Fifteen minutes.
[Emily] I guess no news is good news.
-Tony? -Esme, hi.
Pull the trigger. We're on.
Tomorrow night, in a Newsnight special program,
we will hear for the first time from the duke himself.
In an unprecedented interview,
he speaks to us at length about his friendship with Epstein
and the claims made against him.
Prince Andrew, the Duke of York,
has long faced questions about his ties to the financier Jeffrey Epstein,
who took his life earlier this year while awaiting trial on sex…
-Where does this bloody dust come from? -I know, sir.
[Amanda] "For the prince, the whole nerve-shredding exercise is designed
[Amanda] "For the prince, the whole nerve-shredding exercise is designed to show that he has nothing to hide."
to show that he has nothing to hide."
"It will show that he has been wholly honest and truthful."
"'In a way,' says a friend, 'he is saying, "Judge me.""
It's… It's excellent, isn't it?
It's… It's exactly the right tone.
-[sighs] -Very good.
Would you… Would you like me to be here tonight
when it… goes out?
Oh, no, I don't think so.
No, I really don't think that's necessary.
-[door opens] -[Sam's mum] Hello!
Nana, this is Freya.
-Hello. Come in. Come in. -Freya, this is Netta.
Hello.
Um, in… In fact, I'm convinced
that I was never in Tramps with her.
There's a number of things wrong with that story. One of which is that…
I don't know where the bar is.
I have a, um… a peculiar condition, which is that I don't sweat,
or rather I didn't sweat at the time. And that would…
and that is because I had suffered
what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War.
Because going to Pizza Express in Woking
is an unusual thing for me to do.
A very unusual thing for me to do.
[Emily] So, if Virginia Roberts is watching this interview,
what's your message to her?
I don't have a message for her
because I have to have…
She gives him every chance.
And if somebody's going to make these sorts of allegations…
[Andrew] We try and uphold the highest standards and practices,
and, um, I let the side down, simple as that.
Christ's sake.
[Andrew] No, I don't think so.
You probably dragged out of me most of what's required.
[Lucas] We're gonna sit up front, Mum.
Your Royal Highness.
-[cameras clicking] -[man 1] Amanda! [man 2] Amanda, a quick statement.
Would you like to comment?
The Palace have just released a statement from the Duke of York.
"I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back
from public duties for the foreseeable future,
and she has given me her permission."
"I continue to unequivocally regret
my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein."
"His suicide has left many unanswered questions,
particularly for his victims."
"I can only hope that in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives."
This is what Newsnight is.
We put the time in… to get the stories other shows won't.
Stories that need to be told,
that people care about,
hold the powerful to account
and give victims a voice.
Thank you.
Two lamb shawarma.
The usual.
Thanks. [chuckles]
You seen this? Love to be there when they filmed that!
