I want to cherish our last day.
"Cherish"?
This isn't a school field trip. Get real.
Watch out for the hill!
1988 SAUDI ARABIA
Those crazy bastards.
Kareem!
Faster. Let's go!
All right!
You've got guns this time?
-I knew it'd be something scary. -Get the sand off.
Brush it off.
You'd never know this unless you've been in the army. Here.
Take it out.
I have a bad feeling.
I hope it isn't a wanted poster.
Dong-wook!
Mr. Yoon!
I was going to rip it up! -Be careful. -Are you that happy?
Dong-wook has dreamed of this competition.
You'll need a lot of money for that.
It'll be hard to make this much money in the US.
Come back anytime if you change your mind.
I gotta admit. You're the best drivers in Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Yoon, Dong-wook is the best in the world.
-He's number one! -Oh, please.
Even Americans are no match for Dong-wook.
You will get yourselves killed if you drive around the US like that.
Be careful, all right?
I won't charge for the repairs or other expenses for the sake of our friendship.
for the sake of our friendship. Mr. Yoon,
I wish you a long life.
Don't you have something for me?
You bastards.
Of course we do.
Here, Mr. Yoon.
Get lost, you jerks! Get out of my sight!
Hey!
Are you going to eat jajangmyeon when you get home?
Mansour!
Goodbye. Where are you going?
We're going home now.
Where is home?
'88 OLYMPICS CONFIRMED AN OVERWHELMING VICTORY
WISHING SUCCESS IN THE SEOUL OLYMPICS
-Bye. -Goodbye, ladies!
Look who it is.
How have you been?
It seems like you made it from Saudi Arabia.
You two look amazing today!
-Joon-gi! -Bok-nam!
Dong-wook!
McDonald's!
Thanks, Bok-nam!
McDonald's in Seoul? What a great world we live in.
That's what's so great about Seoul.
"The world to Seoul. Seoul to the world." Okay?
Hey.
Wow, you got a new taxi?
You're successful!
You know, in English, you say, "This is my car."
Just open the trunk.
I got a new car, and I'm here to pick you guys up.
Hey, Park Dong-wook!
Bok-nam.
-Get in! -What's wrong?
The trunk hasn't been loaded yet.
What's the matter?
Who are they?
I don't know. I've never seen them before.
You don't know?
Did you get in trouble again in Saudi Arabia?
My hamburger.
Hamburger?
Let's just load these up and leave.
Bok-nam.
Our neighborhood…
How did this happen?
FIX THIS PROJECT THAT DOESN'T ENSURE HOUSING
It's the Olympics.
They're making a fuss over the maintenance project.
They tore everything down.
What's it called? Right. "Maintenance of Visible Areas."
What's it called? Right. "Maintenance of Visible Areas." Maintenance, my ass. This is basically a war zone.
Maintenance, my ass. This is basically a war zone.
Don't you agree?
Drive.
Well, this is a nice welcome.
Park Dong-wook.
I bet you missed the taste of kimchi.
Let's go, boys!
SANGGYE-DONG REDEVELOPMENT AREA
Move! I can't see him!
Hey, it's Galchi!
Wow, they're still here?
Park Dong-wook.
I've been practicing like hell while you were gone.
That moron.
What does he want now?
Why does he hate you so much? What did you do wrong?
What do you think you're doing?
Step on it!
Watch this. I'll show you a real vibe.
Hey!
Hey, Dong-wook!
Dude, what's up with you?
Dong-wook!
Spin!
Turn on the wipers! Quickly!
Where is he? Park Dong-wook, where did you go?
Find him!
Park Dong-wook, where did you go?
DO NOT DEMOLISH PEOPLE LIVE HERE!
Dong-wook!
What the hell are you wearing?
Damn it.
Stop acting like you were in North Korea.
Yoon-hee, you've gotten even prettier.
My Joon-gi, how have you been?
-You missed me? -Hey.
I told you not to ride bikes.
Hey.
I became the head of the Seoul branch.
-I'm the bike queen. -You're in a bike gang now?
No, that's what you do. Just with four wheels.
Let's go eat meat. Aren't you hungry?
-Yes, she's right. -I'll grill meat for you.
-You did it back there too. -Drop it.
Come on!
CAR MAINTENANCE CONTEST 05.10.1987
You punk.
That nutjob.
Brother Dong-wook, Brother Joon-gi, welcome.
Jeez.
Forget about all the coarse sand.
This is Bbangkku, a land flowing with milk and honey.
But I see you're empty-handed. Can you explain why?
Oh, right!
I left it at the airport because of some sketchy guys chasing us.
Are you saying you've got nothing for me?
Gifts, my ass. We almost died on our way here.
Died? Did I hear that right?
By the way, what's this? This isn't Jamaica.
How come your style has become even tackier?
What an eyesore.
Brother, did you get a blast of sand in your eyes in the desert?
Let's get your eyes checked. I'll get you glasses.
Look at how hip they are.
Whatever. Where did you put my babies?
I hid them in the back, punk.
Seriously…
Now it looks good.
Put this back where it was.
Get rid of all of your shiny crap.
What's up with you?
You have no idea who's been taking care of Bbangkku and everything else.
The first thing you say when you come back--
Are those customers?
Wait, maybe they're the guys from…
What are you doing?
What did you do?
-Bring it on. -Who is it?
Jeez, that sly bastard.
Park Dong-wook.
Did you just say "bastard"?
No wonder they say you can't change people. Watch your mouth.
Anyway, Dong-wook, you've still got your driving skills.
You dumbass. I just wanted to talk, but you ran like your life depended on it.
You brought many things.
When will you come to your senses?
This is why you shouldn't be soft with ex-convicts.
-It's burning! -Damn.
You shouldn't burn your meat.
You used to talk about the US, and now you're having LA ribs.
Hey, mister!
Who are you? Do you have a warrant?
Everybody asks for a warrant. Kids these days watch too much TV.
-Did you watch Chief Investigator too? -What?
I bet you haven't seen a real prosecutor before.
DISTRICT PROSECUTOR
Those guys have seen me before. Hey, give it to me.
This is my first time seeing him.
Don't touch that. You'll rip it!
You came all the way for that American-made stuff? Are you joking?
Interesting things were caught on this camera.
Amazing. I can't believe you're Korean with the balls you've got on you.
I told you not to film.
I know… REPORT ON KEY FIGURES …what you did last summer.
Hey.
What's that?
Are you guys insane?
What on earth did you do over there?
You used to make illegal deals in Dongducheon,
and you got an illegal job abroad transporting dangerous goods.
Violated the Foreign Exchange Control Act.
You put the money you made in Saudi Arabia into your mother's bank account in the US.
Your mother is also in my file for currency fraud.
You came all the way here just to arrest me for something like that?
A noble prosecutor like you?
Making money abroad? Fine. Smuggling it into the country? Illegal.
Fixing a bbangkku? Fine. But customizing the vehicle? Illegal.
Driving a taxi? Great. But if it's unlicensed? Illegal.
Flirting with ladies? Fine. But breaking their hearts? Illegal.
As for you,
having the wrong kind of older siblings is illegal.
What on earth are you doing?
Dong-wook, don't mess with me.
At this rate, you'll never make it to the US.
If I proceed with this,
you'll be banned from leaving this country and will be arrested immediately.
You'll get a longer sentence as a repeat offender.
A visa? You won't even get a glimpse of it.
I'm sorry, but I'll send the money to the national treasury.
I'm sorry, but I'll send the money to the national treasury. No, just kidding. I came all the way here instead.
Don't you think you're wasting your talents?
You know what I mean?
Living like an outlaw is like moonwalking.
You keep going backward.
Hey.
You're a fan of Knight Rider too?
That show has this great quote.
So, what?
Who the hell are you?
Who am I?
The one who'll get you to America.
Do some business with me.
When it's done, I'll let you go without question.
To the US.
Seriously…
Do you want us to become spies for you?
Park Dong-wook, you're all grown-up now.
You're smarter now.
Why don't you remove these first?
Then I'll listen to you.
Let's look at our first target.
Kang In-sook, the president of the loan shark industry. Number two in Korea.
Lee Hyeon-gyun, a former major in the Defense Security Command. Now, he's Kang's sidekick.
They manage the former government's secret fund. They're the worst.
Recently, the mules who used to work for them were all caught.
So they'll be picking new drivers.
You need to go there and get the information I want.
So, you want to use us to arrest those two?
No.
Then what?
They are just a bonus. I want someone higher.
REPEATED DICTATORSHIP
No way.
That guy without any hair up here? Oh my.
You want to get the dictator, the massacre expert?
Anyway, we're just gonna be mules, right?
Right.
But you need to pass a secret test to become their drivers.
It won't be easy.
All the best drivers are going to be there.
The test is tomorrow.
Tomorrow? We don't even have cars.
Is a taxi allowed?
Say we pass the test, what then?
The Saudi Arabia problem will be resolved.
If you find proof like the secret accounting ledger,
I'll eliminate your criminal records.
A clean slate.
Am I supposed to believe this?
Forgive our crimes?
You want it in writing?
That's not enough.
What?
If we pass the test and get visas for all of these guys,
If we pass the test and get visas for all of these guys, then I'll believe you.
Deal.
Are we clear?
Right, John.
You'll be DJing in this plan.
Just be ready for my instructions.
What "instructions"?
-Just be quiet. -Okay.
Take some pictures with this.
I want to donate it to the history museum later.
I'll leave the tool here.
It's new, so be careful with it.
Your tax money paid for it, okay?
What's he talking about? We never paid taxes. I've been paying taxes recently.
How is that possible?
Just like I thought. Mules from all over the country are here.
They're all going to be desperate to get some fame from this job.
JUNG-GU INTERIOR MAP Exchange your movie ticket for a film container and deliver it.
Exchange your movie ticket for a film container and deliver it.
You'll leave Daehan Cinema, and your destination is Namsan Hotel.
You pick the route.
Jeez, you're so slow.
You'll be working all night.
Get lost.
You're no help, damn it.
You have ten minutes, but you might get into an accident.
-Let's win. -We can do it.
Yeah.
I could've carried it all, but they're heavy.
No one's going to marry you.
I don't care if you get hurt, but don't damage the car.
There'll be some brawls too.
You'll be on public roads, and it'll be dangerous as hell.
Do you ever shut up?
What, punk?
Damn.
DJ Moon Knight, how is it going?
Hey, Dong-wook,
I'm no longer a DJ.
Then what are you?
S-P-Y. I'm a spy.
LARGE BBANGKKU
Director.
He is in the sauna.
-So? -Why don't you see him when he's done?
A morning sauna is bad for you.
Bullshit.
Come into the bath.
It took me two hours to do my hair and makeup this morning.
Sweating in here helps clear your mind. Everything becomes clear.
I'm going to select new drivers today.
Make it quick.
They'll start attacking us right after the Olympics.
We made him the president. How can he stab us in the back?
That's how it works around here.
To be honest…
it's getting on my nerves.
it's getting on my nerves. It's basically a premium.
Don't you agree?
A premium? Please.
This country isn't some convenience store.
Anyway, he might seem soft,
but he's got some aspirations.
He'll try to act like the boss now, so prepare yourself.
After the opening ceremony,
you should rest somewhere that has great views.
I'm leaving.
Don't sell illegal tickets here!
It's a beauty with an air dam!
Look at those modifications.
Wow! A BMW!
Hey, there's an M5 too.
M5? I know about it.
M5 is great.
But an M5 can't beat a Grandeur.
Galchi's here too!
What does he think he's doing here?
Oh my. This thing is almost on fire.
Hey, Galchi, I never thought I'd be glad to see you.
Thanks to you, we won't come in last.
John made this mixtape just for our drive today.
I don't like his taste in music lately.
You know what John said?
He said he's the Saint Paul of Korean hip-hop.
Don't make me laugh.
He's just listened to some music. That's all.
Saint Paul was a scholar.
And John went to college, so don't doubt him.
We'll never be like him.
Joon-gi, do you really need that water tank?
Just focus on navigating.
The bigger the engine, the bigger the cooling water tank.
Oh, really?
Robocop!
Top Gun!
Dirty Dancing!
Two Moon Junction.
La Bamba!
There's no time for this. Anybody for La Bamba?
Here, La Bamba.
Those bastards.
Here goes the safe drivers' navigation guide.
Turn right in 500 meters. The curve is at two o'clock.
Dong-wook, watch out!
These assholes are no joke.
Joon-gi, start pumping.
Jeez.
Damn.
Well done, Park Dong-wook!
Look out!
Hold on!
Where do we go now, Bok-nam?
Chungmu University is this way.
-Should I go in? -Just wait a second.
Go! What's the worst that could happen?
Who are they?
They're cops. Fucking pigs.
OUR SENIORS AREN'T COMING BACK
Hey, arrest them. Come here!
On your left, Galchi!
Hey!
Park Dong-wook!
Stop getting in my way, you son of a bitch!
Red Galchi, out!
-Dong-wook. -Damn.
Shit! That Galchi bastard.
Dong-wook.
Doesn't that motorcycle look familiar?
Hello, sir.
Please cooperate with traffic control for the Olympics.
What's she doing?
When did she become a cop?
Damn it.
Suck on that!
That's my Dong-wook!
Give me one too.
I'm going up first. Make sure to get rid of the cops.
Yes, sir.
Where is it?
La Bamba!
-We're here! -Right.
Have fun watching it.
Which way? Come on.
Hey, what are you doing?
What's up with…
He's really sensitive.
Hey.
What? Not gonna feel me up too?
You dumbass.
Okay.
Congratulations.
You must be the winner. Well, yes.
Are you a team?
As you can see, yes.
You've got good style.
What a fun team.
This way.
She has a very intimidating vibe.
Are you scared?
No way. I've got a black belt.
You brought my favorite one.
Did we do all that shit just for that?
Jackson is art.
Sorry I'm late.
Hey.
Have you even been in the army?
You see,
we're bunkmates and drivers in the army.
And you?
Director Lee,
he's obviously a kid.
Men from the army are trustworthy.
Now, you'll get your job assignments from Director Lee.
As you can see, he's a bit uptight,
but bear with him. We'll be fine, ma'am.
Let me tell you the rules first. One, do not touch the goods.
Two, do not tell anybody where the goods are from.
Three, we're complete strangers.
You'll be making ten deliveries.
You'll get paid ten million won for each delivery.
Ten million…
Per delivery? 100 million in total.
-If you need anything-- -The money isn't enough.
-Not enough? -Are you insane?
We don't even know what we're delivering. A hundred million isn't enough.
That's what I'm saying.
-That makes sense. -Right.
You've got guts.
I don't stop stepping on the accelerator until I go all the way.
You should go all the way.
For the first five deliveries, ten million per delivery, like always.
For the first five deliveries, ten million per delivery, like always. Ten million per person for the rest.
And 40 million per delivery. Good?
Not bad.
But you need to show me that you're worth the money.
Once we start working, there's no turning back.
Let's have some fun now.
-You guys are disgusting -I think we're fucked.
That guy will throw a fit because we fucked up the Sonata.
Just get him a new one. No big deal.
How much can we get paid?
What?
Where do you think you are?
You have a huge task ahead of you. Wake up!
On the ground!
Seriously?
Yes, sir.
Am I wrong?
-Are you crazy, you geezer? -This isn't a joke.
-Are you crazy, you geezer? -This isn't a joke. You really hit the booze
just because President Kang told you to have fun?
Are you a thug? Watch your mouth. I'll blow your head off.
Dong-wook.
Well, what now? I need a car for this job.
That's why you need to get a faster car.
That's your second test.
If you've had enough fun, get lost. Dismissed!
He burned the car?
Yes, he did.
The camcorder got burned too.
Lee Hyeon-gyun, that crazy military nut. He really is insane.
Well, be careful, all of you.
Will the car be ready soon?
Pretty amazing, isn't it?
These were from the treasury. Take a look around.
Holy moly!
This is a BMW!
Oh my, it's a Porsche!
I can't believe they were in Korea.
This is paradise.
I need nothing but this one.
Come on, Bok-nam! I'm the engineer, so I should pick the car!
All of you, stop.
That's enough.
Stop looking, or it'll spoil you.
Come over here.
What's he saying?
What are these pieces of garbage?
They're yours. This is from precious tax money.
Pick among these. Or you can just drive the one that I give you.
What's up with you?
Your youngest nephew's first birthday party is today.
Why are you still at work?
You still haven't gotten married. Don't work too hard.
And don't forget your home.
All right. Stop nagging me.
Just get to the point.
If you're trying to take the former government's pocket money,
If you're trying to take the former government's pocket money, you might be taken instead.
It'll work.
If it doesn't, I'll make it work.
And it's not "pocket money." It's their secret fund.
They're trying to launder money and run away with it under the new regime.
They're trying to launder money and run away with it under the new regime. How can I let them do that?
I'd like to see them try laundering that money in a washing machine.
The dirt will never get washed away.
What about Director Lee's lackeys you caught?
Anything from them?
They're all from Squad 606.
Spies sent to North Korea.
Starting my plan B with the drivers
will be faster than waiting for them to talk.
You mean an illegal taxi driver and some smugglers in Saudi Arabia?
And what's that?
-They're all strays. -That's why they're perfect.
The military, police, or prosecutors, nobody knows them.
-How perfect is that? -Hey.
You know that I work for the president. He does nothing about this
because his opponents are tough.
The blame might fall on you.
I've already started it. I might as well go all in.
I never know what you're thinking.
I'm done here. You're on your own from now on.
It's unofficial. A secret investigation.
Okay?
You're even worse than Kim Il-sung.
If you're done picking your car, go get ready.
Look at the condition of this car.
What are we supposed to do with this?
You punk. That's why you're here. Figure it out yourselves.
We'll give up on getting a foreign car. Give us an extra car instead.
You're the only driver. Why do you need three cars?
Jeez.
We need at least three cars--
Rule number four.
Do not ask questions about our methods.
Rule number four?
What are the others? Anyway, give us one more car.
That Grandeur. Wait, there's a Grandeur here?
I didn't see it either.
It's right here!
No.
-There's no Grandeur. -Let's go.
Why not? You told us to pick one.
Well, we don't have a Grandeur in here.
Isn't that a Grandeur? Hey…
That's…
That's my car.
Not a chance.
Damn, that's a new car.
Move your smelly feet!
Come on!
What kind of girl smells this bad?
Come on. Get out, Dong-wook.
Get out!
I'm dying here. Joon-gi. Come on, get out.
Hello, sir.
Joon-gi, what a sharp tailbone you have.
Are you all going in together?
Why?
Do you always have to stick together? It's noisy.
Yes.
Let's go.
Are we that noisy?
Don't be too surprised.
Here!
How much is that?
Around five billion won?
-Probably a bit more than that. -Five billion?
Not 500 won? Oh, I'm sorry.
It's not that much, so you should be able to get the job done quickly.
All you need to do is take this money and buy me what I want.
Simple, right?
THE DELIVERY PLAN
Let's go.
First, the outer part will be the Pony pick-up so that it'll look cool.
It's going down.
The engine's from the Grandeur, with 130 horsepower.
The suspension and seats are from the Concord.
We'll combine three cars into one.
In order for the three of us to be in the car,
we'll upgrade the Pony into the one with three seats.
I've always wanted to do this.
The color should be black, of course.
Good job.
Inch up the tires.
Lower the body of the car.
The handle will be a D-curve.
Make it fast and accurate. Drift the car with this rhythm, with this vibe.
Drift the car with this rhythm, with this vibe.
Let's roll.
Get back safely. Good luck!
We got this!
SEOUL STATION
Start your deliveries today.
You must never be late.
When you complete your missions, you'll get a stamp per delivery.
WELL DONE!
NAMDAEMUN
Each time you get five stamps, the president will give you a bonus.
-We got another stamp? -Nice.
HAN RIVER
Thank you.
Good night, sir.
NO DRUNK DRIVING
One apple, one grape.
EULJIRO
Dong-wook! Hurry!
-What the… -Freeze!
Get up!
Stop right there!
-Hey! -Cops!
Do you want to die? Come here!
That's why you were followed. Do you want to stand out that badly?
Why are you making such a fuss? Aren't you ashamed?
I'm not.
That's right.
Wherever we go, the cops find us right away.
That guy, Director Lee, bothers me too. So annoying.
Lee Hyeon-gyun doesn't trust you. That's all.
The higher-ups sent the police.
The new resident of the house with the blue roof is after the former one.
He wants him to cough up the money he stole.
You guys are snatching the money before he gets to it.
-Who owns the house with the blue roof? -Gosh.
Just eat.
Right, I saw them take out something else from the boxes they got
other than the stuffed tigers.
There was also a hidden room in the penthouse.
A hidden room?
The accounting ledger is probably there.
Kang is meticulous.
You see, the president's into me.
I'll look into it.
Just keep an eye on them.
Don't do anything stupid. You'll get hurt.
I'll make some drinks for you too.
-How many deliveries are left? -We're almost done.
-We have a couple more. -Why would you pour soju in the beer?
I hope that the rest of your deliveries go smoothly.
Drink up.
This is called "so-beer." I came up with it. So good.
BONUS
We got a bonus!
Hey, what are you doing?
Look at this.
Not bad.
Okay, good!
-Wait! -Hey!
Move, you asshole!
-Okay! -Bring it on!
You're looking happy lately. Are things going well?
Is it that obvious? I get paid ten times more than before.
Ms. President would make me a chaebol. The best job ever.
"Ms. President"? You're basically her lapdog now, aren't you?
I'm scum, right? I used to talk about justice in school.
You've never been to the US. What's with the English?
It's like you're an American immigrant.
Appearance is what matters.
Faith, hope, love, and appearances.
I can tell you studied theology. I've been blessed.
Lord, hallelujah!
How much do you think that apartment costs?
They say 100 million won on TV.
That's expensive as hell. It doesn't even look cool.
No, It looks cool.
Aren't you going? You'll get caught.
I was about to leave. I have plans in Apgujeong.
Is it a date?
Is it that girl from before? Are you psychic?
Lord, amen. I'm leaving.
Jeez.
What? Who is it this time?
Why did you buy those ugly glasses?
Ugly?
-What's that? -It looks good on you.
That's…
Look at this, Joon-gi.
-It's a Mercedes-Benz! -It has two windshield wipers!
-Look at the tires. -So cool!
-Look at this paint, Joon-gi. -It's something else.
Why is this window so dark?
Oh my! Ms. President, long time no see.
You all look cooler.
Of course we do. We're great.
You're all getting a gift today, and I prepared something for you.
-I hope you'll like it. -A gift!
You can get it from my secretary.
-What does she have there? Is that a bag? -What is it?
I'll see you later.
-Goodbye. -Take care.
Drive safe.
Mercedes-Benz is great.
-An envelope? -Why is she…
What's this?
Real estate purchase contract? Apartment?
Wait, is this…
Yes, it's your bonus.
Where is this apartment?
We saw it before!
This is crazy!
Dong-wook, we're successful!
That's like the Los Angeles and Beverly Hills of Korea.
Right?
This place has two bathrooms! One of them is mine!
I don't think we need to go to LA.
Here's your key and some money.
Since you're off duty today, enjoy yourselves.
Apgujeong!
Joon-gi!
How many zeros are there?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
100 million won!
Step on it, Dong-wook!
Faster!
MBC CAMERA RAID
We're in front of a club in Itaewon.
It's past midnight.
This place is an entertainment district with over 280 neon signs.
Why are you acting like this?
Because this asshole hit me first!
He hit me first!
These men are causing a huge public disturbance.
-Please go home. -Hey!
-Fuck, did you hit me? -It wasn't me.
I tried to stop them… Nobody's stepping in.
-Asshole! -Please stop. You'll get hurt.
They look stupid, all drunk and fighting like that.
Let go of me.
You need to control yourself sometimes.
-Let me go. -Stop fighting!
Your clothes are too revealing. Don't you care what others think?
Not at all. I don't care.
I wear whatever I want to.
Because I'm worth it.
All right.
I'm Ji Pyeong-hwan, reporting for MBC Camera Raid.
You put your face in front of the camera?
Are you all insane? Stay on your toes!
Today in Insa-dong…
This should be a family heirloom! What an honor!
We made it onto the news.
Joon-gi, you have a healthy liver.
I'm suffering over here.
OLYMPIC LIVE BROADCAST WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER
What's that?
That's SoBangCha! Let's go see them!
Let's go see SoBangCha!
Bok-nam, can we go see SoBangCha? Please?
I'll give you a ride.
What SoBangCha? You're making me nauseous. I'm still hungover. I'm not going.
Lee Sang-eun.
That song, "Damdadi" by Lee Sang-eun.
Damdadi, damdadi, damdadi-dam
"Damdadi." Aren't you going?
Don't be ridiculous!
Haven't you started your motorcycle yet?
-Oh, should I? -Let's go.
-Get the helmet. -The delivery's at three.
-Yeah. -Don't get caught on camera!
Damdadi, damdadi, damdadi-dam
Don't encourage her.
They're together. I'm sure they're fine.
You get both duties today. Come sit up front.
We're going to be late.
Is he an amateur? Damn.
Watch out!
Shoot!
Aren't you going to greet your superior?
-What? -Freaking hell.
Such bad manners.
I'll fix that today, for sure.
-Shit. -Come here.
-What are you doing? -Oh, I'm so scared.
Your eyes almost popped out.
All of this is just a joke to you. Isn't it?
All right, who wants to pick?
How about you?
What are you saying, you fucking psycho?
Dong-wook!
What did you do when you met?
Do what, you crazy son of a bitch?
Meet up with whom? And do what?
You really thought I wouldn't find out?
Start talking on three,
or I'll blow your little sister's head off. One.
We didn't meet with anybody!
Director,
no, big brother. Why are you doing this?
We don't know anything, I swear.
Stop fucking around and put that gun away!
Two.
Hey, shoot me instead. Kill me, you crazy asshole!
Just kill me!
Fine.
-No, Dong-wook! -Dong-wook!
Any last words?
Three.
Hey, did I scare you?
You totally got scared.
I'm not killing you, you dumbasses.
I was just playing around.
Stop glaring at me.
You've passed the test! Real men know how to keep a secret.
Since you passed the test, I'll give you a gift. THE 12TH PRESIDENT
And
don't be too cocky thinking President Kang's got your back.
If you try to mess with the general's business, I'll kill you.
You'll all get a bullet to the head!
So stay on your toes! Understood?
The police caught one of the smugglers.
What a useless piece of shit.
Before any information leaks,
take care of the money left in the safe.
Ms. Yoon-jae.
No party today?
I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you.
It was canceled.
You don't need to be sorry.
Have you had dinner?
Why did she call us for a golf game in the middle of the night?
Isn't this nice though?
Mr. Lee, which sport were you in charge of?
Probably wrestling.
You can watch sports on TV. Why would they make you do all that? How annoying.
Oh my.
There's Ms. Kang.
Were you having fun?
We've just been here waiting for you, Ms. Kang.
Oh, stop it, Mr. Lee.
Ms. Kang,
things have been a bit tense lately with those tax audits and all.
Right, the tax audits.
If you don't like the tax audits, make sure to get a lot of gold medals.
Remember what the general said?
If you get good results in the Olympics, he won't do tax audits.
We don't know if the next big man will keep that promise.
I should've gone to the Korea Military Academy too.
You're being such crybabies.
You know that the general would never steal from someone else's pockets.
Your donations won't be used anywhere else.
We're going to use that money for the new foundation.
Now, it's almost time for the general to arrive.
So let's wrap things up here.
I called the Public Prosecutor General here today.
You put something like this on your arm.
Have you played around before?
I wish.
It's a mark.
A wound of glory.
Well, she doesn't give this mark to just anybody.
Do you mean Ms. Kang?
This is a bit harsh.
She's a scary woman.
That's why even the general won't mess with her.
So, are we dead meat if we get caught doing this?
Don't even joke about that.
We'd really get in trouble.
I'll go shower first.
I sent my boys to check on the car repair center.
There were no listening devices.
That's it. We're out.
You guys knew it wouldn't be that easy.
I agreed to be a mule, nothing more, nothing less.
You keep changing things.
You gave me a lot of information. If John brings the key--
Do you think John is a spy or something?
As you know, if we get the key, the accounting ledger will be ours.
Screw the accounting ledger. John could die!
Listen, Dong-wook.
Let's take some time to think this over from the start.
Aren't you going to the US? Have you forgotten our deal already?
Besides,
if I wanted to, I could send you all to prison. Forget about the United States.
You can do whatever you want to do.
I'm out.
Park Dong-wook!
Don't you want to know how corrupt things happen in your country?
The reason why I'm trying so fucking hard
The reason why I'm trying so fucking hard to put that piece-of-shit dictator in jail? Aren't you curious?
The US and cars. That's all you think about.
Vain, thoughtless bastards like you are the reason why
those assholes treat citizens like shit and live high on the hog, you moron!
That money you're delivering
was made from the blood and sweat of people like us.
If we fail, those assholes will take everything.
How are you going to deal with that?
I didn't know you cared so much about justice.
I'm sorry.
I only care about myself.
The things you talk about, like justice, love for the country,
I put myself first before any of that crap.
And the reason why I want to go to the US is…
not because I'm vain. It's because of my dream.
Keys in my pocket, John in the house
What's up, Joon-gi?
What's the matter?
Did someone die?
Bok-nam.
Why is he so quiet? Is he sick?
That damn "Damdadi."
What did we do wrong? We didn't know what would happen.
What's going on?
Damn.
Well, a few hours ago…
Never mind.
Why did you come back so early?
Bbangkku spy. Mission complete. My name is Bond, John Bond.
Is this it? Really?
Did you really get it?
You did all the hard work.
Made by Joon-gi.
This is it.
We can get all those sons of bitches with this.
Let's hit Director Lee in the back of his head!
Dong-wook should know that I made it. Where is he?
Dong-wook is in the office. He's packing.
"Packing"? What do you mean?
Dong-wook, what are you doing?
A friend from Saudi Arabia told me that he'll get me a ship.
I'm leaving this country with everyone.
And go where?
Didn't you hear what happened earlier?
I did.
But they're fine now. Director Lee is fucking crazy. That's all.
Someone could have died, asshole.
Yoon-hee, Bok-nam, and everyone, you dumbass!
Hey, no need to get so mad.
Dong-wook,
I got the key. Once we get the accounting ledger, we're done.
Are you insane?
Do you think you've actually become a spy or something?
Get real, John.
Hey. I put my life on the line doing this.
You think I don't care?
What if things go wrong? Will you take responsibility?
How can you say that after hearing what happened?
I'll leave as soon as possible. All this has been too much from the start.
"Too much" my ass!
You feel good about running away again? Last time, Saudi Arabia. Where are you gonna go now?
He said he'll forgive our crimes. And the visas? He told us we can get them.
Do you still trust Prosecutor Ahn?
Forgive our crimes? Visas?
That's all just bait, you dumbass.
You're such a fucking coward.
Do you have to blame the prosecutor? Nobody forced you into this.
You've all known what we were going to do, am I wrong?
We can do it. No, we're the only ones who can do it, so why not?
Do you really want to quit now and be a lowlife scum forever?
All you have is your appearance. Who are you calling a scum?
Shit.
Dong-wook.
When you're racing, where are you looking?
What the hell are you asking?
Never mind.
Yeah, let's stop here.
GIFTED FROM THE 12TH PRESIDENT
Is this--
-Over there. -Oh, here?
Hello there.
Sir.
Good work.
-All you need is the accounting ledger. -No.
You guys are done too.
I don't think you can get the accounting ledger.
Who else is gonna do it?
You don't trust us after all you've made us do?
It's not that.
Haven't you talked to Dong-wook?
I didn't expect them to go crazy like--
I really have no idea what's on your mind.
Why so serious all of a sudden?
I'm fine. We're fine.
Yes, we are.
Director Lee might be crazy, but he's nothing compared to Yoon-hee.
She's a lot crazier.
Hey!
Director Lee, that damn military nut. How dare that military nut do that to us?
See?
We can't live like lowlifes. We have our pride.
I know you don't have anybody else for the job, so just tell us what to do.
Yeah, it doesn't feel right.
You idiots.
You sure you can do this?
Don't worry. Normal people like us are perfect for jobs like this.
Nobody will notice who screwed over those assholes.
Right?
All right!
You see, I'm a very skilled black belt.
-With one blow, I could knock him… -He's lying again.
Right.
You can have your baby back.
The athletes are entering the country to compete in the Seoul Olympics, the big global festival.
to compete in the Seoul Olympics, the big global festival.
They look bright and strong, just like our fall weather.
President Kang will leave the hotel briefly for an event.
Seems like she's on edge, adding more security guards.
You need to sneak in and out as quickly as you can.
I forgot something.
-Will the president be late? -Maybe, since she's at the event.
Darn, today's my wife's birthday.
-What's wrong with this? -Hey, turn it down!
Yes, sir.
This thing is not working.
Hey, move over.
What's wrong with this?
Turn it off already.
-Man, it's on again. -Fuck.
Manager.
The master key in my cabinet…
-Search everywhere. -Yes, ma'am.
Just unplug it.
Wait, stop unplugging it like that…
Oh, the music finally turned off!
-You scared me! Bastard! -What?
You're dead meat.
-What? -Kang.
-What did you say? -President Kang!
-What? -Go back over there.
-Okay. -I'm going.
Hello.
Good times.
You're at the age when nothing scares you. I'll see you later.
Yes, Ms. Kang. Goodbye.
There!
Hey! Stop!
Damn it!
Seriously! You scared the hell out of me!
What kind of hell is that?
Damn you.
How did you know I was here? Did you ask the prosecutor?
Since you all left without me, I knew you'd be doing this.
Anyway, this is really the end.
Let's hand over the accounting ledger, get our visas, and go to LA.
By the way, your makeup…
Do something about that before going to LA--
-It's not makeup. -I'm going to crash. It's a disguise.
You'd better wear a mask.
-Say one more thing… -We're going to crash.
-…and your mouth will be-- -Hey, stop it!
Where will you go now?
He said he'll forgive our crimes. And a visa?
He told us we can get them.
Do you still trust Prosecutor Ahn?
Forgive our crimes? A visa?
That's all just bait, you dumbass.
What are you doing?
I'm telling you that you've been stabbed in the back.
Stop making a fuss.
Let's talk about this slowly and quietly.
Those delivery guys, they're minions for the prosecutor's office!
So?
They've ruined the general's plans!
Those commies have taken the accounting ledger too!
I'll catch those assholes and kill them!
All of this happened because you were too soft on them!
I'm going to report this to the general immediately.
He won't be happy with this! You get it?
Director Lee.
No,
Hyeon-gyun.
If you want to bark at the person taking care of you,
keep your voice down first, you military nut son of a bitch!
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Get out.
Secretary Kim.
Yes, ma'am.
Go to Myeongdong
and prepare to exchange the money in the temple for US bills.
It'll be easier to carry it if it's lighter.
Yes, ma'am.
Yoon-jae.
Yes, Ms. Kang.
Wait to eat dinner.
When you get back, we can eat together.
Yes, ma'am.
They're here.
-You dirty traitors! -Are you okay?
Does loyalty mean nothing to you? How could you just leave me?
What? I was going to come back for you.
-I'll kill you! -Hey.
You're dead meat! Come here!
Come over here!
You're making a cool entrance at the very end.
Why are you back?
I'll take that as a thank-you.
What happened here?
Hey.
-Is this the right place? -Yeah.
This is Prosecutor Ahn's desk.
What on earth happened?
Hey, look at this.
These are our visas.
Let's get out. Hurry.
Hey, wait.
I think that is Prosecutor Ahn's voice.
Hey, go to the car.
You go and start the car. I'll be back after a quick look.
Go…
Take it and go. Quick.
Dong-wook!
-Dong-wook! -Get that asshole!
-Get him! Quickly! -Start the car now!
-Stop right there! -Dong-wook!
-Dong-wook! -Stay still!
Run, you moron!
Open the door!
-You son of a bitch… -Dong-wook!
Open the door, bastard!
Go, you idiot!
Get him!
It's Dad's ignition switch.
Dong-wook, what should we do now?
Director Lee, that son of a bitch.
We need to get going.
We can't stay here long. Let's go find John.
Yeah. Let's go.
You son of a bitch.
That's enough, Director Lee.
We don't have time for this.
You know, people can endure so much pain sometimes.
Unwrap it and show it to him.
Mr. DJ, what do you think this is?
Take a look.
You know this hand, don't you?
What did you do to her?
Losing a hand won't kill you.
Fuck! You call yourselves human beings?
Oh my. I guess our poor DJ here liked Secretary Kim a lot.
Still, love is just love. You should put your own life first, right?
Where's the accounting ledger?
Fuck you.
Go fuck yourself!
Wake him up.
Let's stop. I don't think he's gonna talk.
You can come in.
How did you--
We won't get anything from a run-of-the-mill prosecutor.
I talked to the Public Prosecutor General to get them out,
so let's take care of the money that's left and the goods.
Dong-wook, it's news time!
-Yoon-hee. -Yes.
Call Mom until she picks up.
Hurry, Dong-wook!
He was beaten by the main suspects, Park Dong-wook and his gang.
After beating Prosecutor Ahn, Park Dong-wook and his gang pushed him out…
What's that?
-Prosecutor Ahn fell on top of a car… -Is everyone dead?
They're saying we did all that?
Wow! They think we did that?
Those assholes are crossing the line!
Fuck!
We're in front of the apartment…
Dong-wook, Mom's fine.
Bundles of cash worth one billion won, and around 300 artifacts were found in the master bedroom.
and around 300 artifacts were found in the master bedroom.
This apartment was under the name Park Yoon-hee,
a woman who was confirmed to be their accomplice.
a woman who was confirmed to be their accomplice. She was confirmed to be the sister of Park Dong-wook.
The police are tracking the culprits they believe are still hiding in Seoul.
Despite frequent vehicle searches, they haven't been located yet.
The police are trying to arrest the culprits
and recommend they turn themselves in before they are caught.
General Jeon, Public Prosecutor General, came all this way to our golf club.
Why don't you say a few words for us?
Yes, sure.
All of you, I won't forget your loyalty to your country.
You made this country a better place to live in.
Setting up the foundation isn't enough.
There will be a lot more things for us to collaborate on.
Why did you want to see me? To turn yourself in?
This is President Kang's accounting ledger.
And here is the location…
of the money and goods.
I'm sorry, but this is out of my hands now.
The Prosecutor General is loyal to them.
Even with the original, there's nothing I can do.
I'm going to prove that we didn't do it.
I'm going to reveal the real culprits.
I'm going to gather all the money that we've delivered, and everything left,
and destroy it all right in front of those bastards.
I won't let them have a single coin.
You'll need something more than some mediocre evidence.
And don't get any ideas.
Sir, I…
I don't even know if my friend is dead or alive!
No matter what, I'll do it.
You can do it your way.
What's this?
It was in Mr. Ahn's car.
The person who gave his life for that wouldn't have hesitated long.
Hey.
What are you going to do?
I need to see where they're going.
Stay here.
-What do you mean? Come back! -Dong-wook!
What are you going to do? What on earth is his plan?
Dong-wook!
Where are you going, Dong-wook?
Seriously…
Only one left, right?
Yes. The ones already sent will be kept in the airport. I'll send the rest during the opening ceremony.
The opening ceremony.
That's the perfect day to avoid drawing attention.
I'll see you then.
Yes, ma'am.
What?
Where did he go?
Hi-ya!
You have no idea how amazing I am.
Joon-gi, it's our turn. Are you ready?
I'm ready.
I found them.
Come out, you military nutjob!
You didn't get hit?
Boy, it's so hard to aim these things.
What is it?
-What? -Bring me John.
How touching. What if I don't want to?
You'll want to once you look at my cards.
What?
This is a terrible hand of cards.
And you're out?
Of course, I have a hidden card. Want to see it?
Go ahead. Show me.
I want John first.
Hey, get him.
John.
Oh my.
He's about to be a goner.
He should've stuck to playing in the DJ booth. He even played around with women.
You sons of bitches!
Shit.
Fuck, you really have no class.
That's the reason.
That's why you didn't notice your master abandoned you.
What did you just say?
Joon-gi.
Here.
This is the song of the day.
Sure.
All of you, I won't forget your loyalty to your country.
You made this country a better place to live in.
Setting up the foundation is not enough. There will be a lot more things…
What is this?
Keep listening.
Sir, if the foundation doesn't work out,
then who will be responsible?
That sounds like a question for me.
All the necessary preparations have been made.
Do you remember Director Lee?
This is perfect timing for an ad break, isn't it?
Shut up and keep playing it!
He loves to sacrifice himself.
That's right.
He's a bit dumb because he never went to the Military Academy. But he knows how to take some hits.
So there's no need to worry.
Bring me that right now.
Fuck! Is this damn thing all you have?
You fuckers! Who do you think I am?
I'll fucking kill you!
You broke it. It doesn't matter anyway.
I can get you 100 copies of it if you'd like.
Someone's probably making more copies. Director Lee…
to those assholes,
you're just a mutt.
Are you going to run with your tail between your legs
after you gave them the money?
What the fuck did you say?
Do you think the prosecutor you killed
was working by himself?
The prosecutors will be here any minute.
So?
I'm saying that I'll help you.
You?
Help me?
Just give me the location, and I'll make the delivery for you.
Don't you know?
I'm the best driver around here.
So, you want me to betray the general?
Just give me a billion won.
Or you could take all the blame and go to jail. You're good at taking hits.
You little…
If you are messing with me, I'm really going to kill you.
This time my boys will be in the car too.
Tell them to grab motion sickness meds.
It'll be shaky as hell in there.
Good boy.
You're so handsome. Who do you take after?
Me.
You're handsome like me, right?
So cute.
Hey, Mom!
I told you not to put that here!
This is the best spot to dry these.
Then move your car somewhere else!
The peppers will make my car even hotter!
Bullshit.
Auntie, Dong-wook's here.
My goodness.
-Auntie. -Hey!
What do you think you're doing here?
How dare you come here? Get lost!
Hee-young, he's your friend!
-Auntie! -Dong-wook!
-Auntie! -Joon-gi!
-Welcome. -Damn it.
-Have you eaten yet? -Yes, ma'am.
Right. I'm sorry for what happened to Bbangkku. It's all just a tragedy.
I'm sorry for what happened to Bbangkku. It's all just a tragedy.
My mother says hello from America.
I was about to send her a letter.
By the way, Auntie,
could you…
let us use this place?
What?
Why?
No.
Of course. You can use it all you want.
Use whatever you need.
Mom!
You know Bbangkku is our rival! How could you do that?
Wear proper clothes. Isn't there anything other than those tank tops?
-It's supposed to be cool! -Cool?
You don't even buy me any clothes. This is called fashion!
Bullshit.
Wait here. I'll set your table.
Yes, ma'am.
No.
Not a chance.
No.
I really wanted to keep it, but…
Air Jordan 3, limited edition.
Jordan 3?
Limited edition?
Just one day.
You get one day.
Deal.
Our D-Day is the opening ceremony.
I'll move the bundles of money and the goods in the safe together.
My destination is the Port of Incheon.
Director Lee seems to be planning to run off with the goods.
Our priority is John.
Once we know that John is safe, we'll make our move.
What about the car? Will the one we have work?
I'll make it work. We'll do it our way.
-One… -Two, three!
Come on!
We're doing it Olympic-style this time.
You're preparing as we planned, right?
The tapes are ready.
The recording is ready.
I'll be sure to fill in the empty spot left by John.
Here.
88 SEOUL VIBE
Remember this.
Joon-gi, you've got Hangang Park. Bok-nam, take the Olympic-daero.
Galchi, you've got the parade at the main stadium. Yoon-hee, take the airport.
It's Seongnam, not Gimpo. We're going to get all of them in one picture.
No matter what, we'll drag them down with us.
Let's be fucking annoying.
-Here! -Bravo!
It's John's.
I worked on it for a bit.
Are these pop songs?
Listen to all the hip-hop you want when you go to LA. -Take this with you today. -You know what to do, right?
-Take this with you today. -You know what to do, right? When you get the call later, make sure to pick--
Jeez.
Get out of my way.
Hey.
How come I've only got you weirdos?
This is the Seoul Vibe Plan, sir.
"Seoul Vibe."
Make sure to tell Dong-wook I've also put my life on the line.
All right, go.
You're making me dizzy. Leave.
The commoners will unite against the authority!
What a loud appearance.
Look at this car.
Load the car. I need to get going.
-Load it. -Yes, sir!
All right.
Let's do this.
Start the operation.
Breaking the barriers of ideology,
the 24th Olympics, a global festival for the world's population, is held in Seoul.
Brother.
Hallelujah.
It's good to see you, Sister Saint.
Yoon-hee, give me that flower pot over there.
After the host country for the Olympics was decided
on September 30th, 1981, in Baden-Baden, the whole country prepared
for the Seoul Olympics for seven years.
13,626 athletes from 160 countries
around the globe are in attendance…
I'll miss this damn country.
What's that?
What? Shit!
Let's go!
Get that bastard!
Shit.
Stop the car, you bastard!
I said, stop the car, asshole!
No way!
Dong-wook!
I'll block them all for you! Okay?
Shit.
You're not going anywhere, asshole.
Where are you going, you son of a bitch?
Damn.
Shit.
Where the hell is Galchi?

A letter with words of love
In it
Move.

You morons, are you sure Park Dong-wook is here?
Hey!
I've never worn those for a reason!
Why would you wear them?
What do you care? They're mine! I can do whatever I want!
-Take those off. -No!
-Take them off! -No!
Right now!
Damn it.

I've found them on the other side.
Take them off!
Get in there and grab them!

A letter full of words of love…
And what's that?
That's right. Everyone follow me.
Man, I'm injured too.
I should be the one being helped.
John, I would've become a roasted chicken if it wasn't for you.
You totally got scared.
This isn't a movie. A car doesn't blow up that easily.
Fuck.
Wow.
We almost got fucked.
Fuck.
Shit!
Go! Don't let him escape!
SOUTH SEOUL AIRPORT
Watch me, you little pricks.
This is the Seoul Vibe.
Get this out of my way, assholes!
Ms. Kang, we have a problem.
A problem? What is it?
You need to go now, ma'am.
The money is still on its way. What--
What are they doing?
He's become impatient.
Die, you commies!
Hey, Mr. Dictator's lackey, watch where you're shooting!
Die, you asshole!
Fuck you.
You fuckers.
That bald fucker!
You sons of bitches!
Let's go!
Shit.
John, can you do it?

Where am I looking?
What the hell?
Close the hatch!
You little…
How dare you come here?
Damn it.
I delivered everything for you.
Of course you did.
Who does that belong to?
Answer me, you asshole.
Who does it belong to?
Whose is it? Answer me!
Whose is it? It's mine!
Hey, old lady.
"Old lady"?
Yes, old lady.
You crazy piece of shit…
I hope you get to meet the bald guy in the history museum.
What?
I'm getting off here.
Fuck this. Give me the gun!
-President, we're in a plane. -Give me the gun, you moron!
You son of a bitch! Get him!
Yes, ma'am.
Open the door!
President!
Damn it.
Shit.
It's over, fucker.
Fuck!
Time to switch the teams.

Why won't this thing work? Fuck!
Come on!

Slowly.
Hey!
Su-hyeong, Gyu-hyeong, close your eyes.
Stop that, you prick.
Damn it! I thought you were dead!
I thought you wanted me to die.
Dong-wook, are you okay?
You're alive!
Why didn't you just die?
What's this? It's money!
Wow, it's money!
Breaking news.
Ms. Kang In-sook, also known as the Master of the Loan Sharks and the President of the Underground Economy,
has been imprisoned this afternoon.
Reporter Hong Ye-ji is bringing you this report.
Prosecutors have secured evidence that Ms. Kang laundered
over 50 billion won, and they plan to summon
people listed in her accounting ledger for an investigation.
The police looked into Ms. Kang's banking details,
and it was revealed that Ms. Kang's gang laundered money, engaged in tax evasion…

Man, this feels weird.
Is it really over?
I don't know. It doesn't feel real.
Why? Do you wanna get the rest of the stamps?
-What's up with you? -Damn.
Hey, John Woo.
You should quit being a DJ. Come and work in the field.
No. Sweating like that is so not cool.
Just as I thought. We really don't click.
Damn.
Jeez.

Good work.
You'll be so bored without me.
No way.
That's not true at all!
Sure it is.
Wait.
How are we gonna get to LA? Everything we've saved up got burned.
Well, I have no idea.
The way you're speaking is very suspicious.
Hey, what's there to be suspicious about?
What's that?
You really squirreled this away like a beggar?
-A beggar? -Yeah, you beggar.
You…
Bok-nam, I saw it all.
-Saw what? -This!
-What's this? -Wow, there's so much.
-What are you doing? -Strip him.

What are you doing?
Wow.
You never disappoint, Dong-wook.
Damn.
We need an upgrade before we go to Los Angeles, right?

[Mankins] Yeah?
You want to tell me why your methane sensors are off?
I don't know.
Maybe the batteries are dead.
-Why don't you get us a canary? -This is no joke.
These are to alert you to concentrations of methane.
They must stay on.
-[rumbling] -[miner] Where'd that come from?
Sounds like the open pit.
We hit a methane pocket. That's impossible.
Everybody out! Everybody out!

This how you guys still get your kicks, huh?
Walk away, Gurty. They're idiots.
Walk away, Gurty. They're idiots. [man] Hey.
How's it feel to be best friends with a retard?
He's my brother, Johansson.
And I told you never to call him that.
Retard.
[man] McCann, get in here!
I know what you get, but I talk with a lot of hands for hands sometimes.
[man] Gurty.
We're fired.
But tires to a point rotated go.
Let someone else rotate them. We're fired.
Pack your shit up. Skeeter too. Come on.
[Gurty] I don't want.
-Me never been in, and then today-- -Yeah, I know. I know.
Gurty, I don't care. You're going in.
They're gonna look after you.

Will this help make him self-sufficient, doctor?
I can't promise anything with language, cognition scores like these,
but we'll see what we can do.
-[indistinct chatter on PA] -Hi, John, I'm Dr. Talbot. -Pleased to meet you. -Thank you, I appreciate it.
-Pleased to meet you. -Thank you, I appreciate it. -And hope the world lasts for you. -He's saying, "Hello."
-And hope the world lasts for you. -He's saying, "Hello."
How long to go with them?
With them for the time over? For them, for me?
He's asking what all this entails, doctor.
Well, just a few tests.
If he qualifies for rehabilitation, we arrange housing.
It should take no more than an hour.
-Skeeter. -You can't bring Skeeter in here.
Let them poke and prod you, it's no big deal.
I'll see you in an hour.
Hey. Don't be a big baby.
-Thanks, doctor. -You're welcome.
Uh, John, the examination room is just down the hall.
No readings indicated a methane gas pocket?
So you're saying, as general manager of this facility,
that this was out of the blue?
Completely out of the blue, sir.
We think the gas built up behind the stoping shields, where our PdM sensors couldn't pick it up.
[man on phone] I'm briefing the prime minister in 20 minutes.
Listen carefully.
No one goes in any of the tunnels until that gas is drilled and capped.
Understood, sir. Understood.
Let me ask you, how do we drill and cap a methane pocket without a wellhead?
-I'll get back to you. -[phone beeps]
Get me the Air Force base in Winnipeg, officer in charge of civilian emergencies.
Airlift a 30-ton gas wellhead? Impossible.
And there's no runway up at Katka to land a C-130 on,
and our largest choppers are Chinooks,
which can't carry a 30-ton wellhead.
Payloads of that nature have to go by truck.

Just a sec. Max Tully?
[Tully] Mr. Goldenrod?
What?
I'm Max Tully with Mining Safety. Could I have a word with you?
It's about Katka mine.
What about Katka?
This morning, Tunnel Six collapsed.

I need an 18-foot gas wellhead, 300 feet of pipe delivered up there in under 30 hours.
Eighteen-foot gas wellhead and 300 feet of pipe?
Goddamn, that's a hell of a lot of weight, son.
Can you make it happen?
What do I look like, God? We're three weeks into April.
All my of my drivers are on their way to Hawaii or wherever the hell it is they go during the off-season.
Say, for conversation's sake, you have replacements.
Say for conversation's sake that these rigs have wings.
What have you been smoking?
March 10th, the season ended. That's five weeks ago.
But didn't old-timers back in the '60s drive the lake into April?
Yeah, and most of 'em died doing it.
So it's really that dangerous?
Yeah, it's that dangerous!
Okay, okay. It's a stupid idea. Sorry for asking.
Hey, hey. Kid, come here.
I know all the miners up there in Katka. I know their families.
So… personal opinion.
If I can get drivers and a mechanic
at say 3:00 this afternoon,
and if you can get the provincial government to open up the ice road,
two very big "ifs…"
we'll do it.
Thank you.
[softly] Shit.
Hi, um…
-Excuse me. -Yes.
I brought my brother in this morning. Vocational rehab.
McCann, 813. He's still being evaluated, sir.
The doctor said an hour. It's been two and a half.
We're a little short-staffed today, so please take a seat.
Hey.
Sir! Sir!
[sighs] Get Security on Two East, please.
[man] Hey, bro.
What's happening?
What is all this?
Aw, jeez.
What is going on here?
Xanex and Lexapro, right?
Probably some Oxy for good measure? You know, to take the edge off.
-They're for PTSD. -I know what they're for.
Did you ask for these, Gurty?

[anchor on radio] News all day, every day.
Our top story,
twin explosions rock Northern Manitoba's Katka mine this morning,
killing eight miners and leaving 26 more unaccounted for.
The cause of the explosion has not been determined.
Hi, I'm calling from Trappers Transpo in Winnipeg,
we're in an emergency and need drivers.
Tully, give me 50 bucks. -You got 50 bucks? -Yeah, I do.
-You got 50 bucks? -Yeah, I do. One of my drivers just became available. Thanks.
One of my drivers just became available. Thanks. -Fantastic. What… what's it for? -Bail.
-Fantastic. What… what's it for? -Bail. -Uh, yeah-- What? -Told you this wasn't gonna be easy.
-Uh, yeah-- What? -Told you this wasn't gonna be easy.
Sunglasses and keys.
You protest and throw rocks again, we'll arrest you again.
We're gonna keep doing it till you get off our land.
The city owns that parking lot.
I was referring to North America.
[officer] See you soon.
How's the fight for justice goin'?
You keep building casinos, you'll beat the white man without a shot fired.
You heard about the cave-in up at Katka?
Yeah, it was on the TV in there.
I still haven't heard from Cody, though. I'm worried sick.
He's on the list of those missin'. I'm puttin' together a little rescue mission.
-Ice road? -Yup.
I'm in.
Let's get a head count!
Cody.
One.
-Two. -Three.
-Four. -Five.
-[miner] Six. -Seven.
-Eight. -Nine.
-[miner] Ten. -Eleven.
-Twelve. -Thirteen.
[Dave] I got a wife and kids, Jim. How would I even explain this to them?
No one's gonna force you to go, Dave. I understand. It's not for everyone. Thanks.
What do you got?
Half are retired, half have never seen an ice road.
Next are two guys up from North Dakota. Brothers.
Thank you.
Which one of you guys is Mike McCann?
I am.
-You're the driver, he's the mechanic? -Yup. One of the best.
It says you had experience on the ice road in the Northwest Territory.
That's pretty serious country. What'd you drive?
Anything on wheels.
It says you've had 11 gigs in the last eight years,
which ain't exactly inspiring my confidence.
Some reason that you can't hold down a job?
My, uh… My brother's a veteran, got injured in Iraq.
My brother's a veteran, got injured in Iraq.
Uh, he's got this thing called aphasia, which is--
I know what it is.

I've been his caretaker, for lack of a better word, and… -And we-- -I get it.
We ain't got time. What's his name? Call him "Gurty."
Gurty. Hey.
Gurty, Jim Goldenrod. Grab your toolset, follow me.
Right here.
I want you to pull the rocker armshaft.
I'm gonna time you.
Say when.
-Go. -[watch beeps]
Sweet Jesus.
Okay. Tully?
Send everybody else home and call Katka.
-I got my crew. -[Tully] Where's Tantoo?
She's re-parking somebody else's rig.
She seems a little young.
-I'll have the contracts drawn up. -Thank you.
[miner] Enough.
Anyone not out by now isn't coming out.
-[tapping continues] -You guys hearing that?
-[miners murmuring] -[tapping continues]
-[tapping continues] -That sounds like tap code.
You men, give us a hand.
Somebody had to have been in the Army, Navy, Cub Scouts?
[miner] What are they saying, Cody? "How many alive?"
Look, if you do hear something, you call me, all right?
Yes, sir.
-[tapping continues] -It's, uh… "Twenty-six." -[tapping continues] -"Alive."
Fred, listen to me. Listen to me.
You tell them we're gonna cap that methane with a wellhead.
All right? Then we're gonna blast.
You tell them those wellheads, they're comin' ASAP.
-All right? -Okay. Okay.
"Wellheads arrive ASAP."
What do they mean, "ASAP"?
Six hours?
Twelve hours?
What if it's 30?
Then we're dead.
The 26 includes Lampard.
Yup.
Mankins?
He's alive.
So the question is time.
I mean, no one's ever lasted over 30 hours under permafrost.
Well, the government's got that ice road open.
Safety supervisor guy, he's even managed to, uh, secure transpo.
Jim Goldenrod.
If Jim Goldenrod believes 25-ton wellheads can roll across a frozen lake in April,
I suppose we should believe it too.
All right.
These wellheads are beasts, 18 feet long, 25 ton heavy.
We got three rigs, all identically equipped,
so that we can achieve tactical redundancy.
We're taking every chance to save those miners' lives.
Tactical re-what-ancy?
Redundancy. Each rig doesn't need the others to complete the mission.
Gold star to the man from North Dakota!
One, two, three. The gold one is mine.
You two can paper-rock-scissors for the red one. She's the one with the comfy seats.
It's all yours.
[Tully] Contracts.
-One for you. -Thanks.
[Tully] One for you, you.
$200,000 split four ways.
Any questions?
What happens to anyone that doesn't make it, to their money?
Paragraph four, their share goes to those that do.
That's pretty cold.
Sounds fair to me. Who's that guy?
Uh, Mr. Varnay.
Tom Varnay, Katka International Insurance Group.
Tully, these are my trucks. I say who goes.
They're your trucks, but it's Katka's insurance, so if one goes in the lake, it's on Katka.
He's not takin' a cut? No, no, no. Absolutely not.
I'm just along for the ride and to protect Katka's investment.
All right, you'll ride with Tantoo in the black Kenworth.
Put your gear in there. You two will find safety bags in the locker area. It's time to load up.
You two will find safety bags in the locker area. It's time to load up.
We'll fuel the rigs and we'll push in 15.
Thank you. Thanks.
-Thank you. -[Varnay] Hello.
[Mike] Fifty grand apiece times two!
That's more than enough for a down payment on a rig like this.
Sorry I ripped up your brochure, by the way.
I'm gonna put Skeeter up front with us, okay?
-[Skeeter squeaking] -Where are ya?
[Varnay] Tantoo, is it?
Tully says you're Cree.
What's your name mean?
[slowly] Name mean… "Like to drive alone."
Mount up! Use the head if you have to now!
We're on a bull run!
See you on the flip side, Tully.
We'll run with 200-foot separations, leapfrogging every few hours.
-Everyone good with that? -Yup.
Afirmativo.
First leg, Lake Winnipeg ice road. It's about 300 miles, 20 hours.
Second leg, up over Manitoba Pass.
Third leg, Manitonka ice road to Old Manitonka Bridge.
Twenty-three hours total.
What's wrong with New Manitonka?
[Jim on radio] The new bridge would be preferred, but gettin' up to New Manitonka's another 90 kilometers.
That puts us outside the miners' oxygen window.
Old Manitonka was built in the '60s, so that's rated 75,000 pounds?
Yup. We're gonna be shaving it close.
Here we go, people.
[miner clears throat] Oh, shit.
You said 120 meters that way, 80 that way.
Give or take.
Pretty decent atmospheric volume.
Yeah, except we got 26 sets of lungs down here.
[Mike on radio] Hey, Jim.
Yeah.
I thought I heard every trucker's expression,
so what the heck's a "bull run"?
"Bull run," well, back in Minnesota,
"Bull run," well, back in Minnesota, all the livestock haulers never used to stop,
'cause bulls, you see, gotta be standin' when they're being transported.
As soon as one gets tired and lies down, then the others will step on him and kill him.
All livestock haulers know this, so they never stop for anything.
[Mike] Ah, I see. I've learned something tonight.
Hey, Jim, how you feelin' about the ice?
[on radio] Cold, hard, and stiff.
I wish we weren't runnin' in bright sunshine tomorrow though.
You want a sandwich?
You haven't eaten since we left.
You'll know when I'm hungry. It's very unattractive.
You get cranky? Worse, I act white.
Tully said you and Goldenrod had a falling out.
That wasn't a big deal.
It sounded like a big deal.
He fired me, I got upset, took a swing at him. It's old news.
How's that Kenworth, boys?
Uh, she's a fine ride, Jim.
Thinkin' we might get one just like it.
-Well, what you gonna call her? -[Mike chuckles]
[Jim] Take your time, boys. Namin' a big rig's a sacred thing.
What'll we name our truck, Gurty?
Mmm. Truck-truck-truck.
[laughing] You hear that? "Truck-truck-truck." I like it. It's got a ring to it.
"Truck-truck-truck." I like it. It's got a ring to it.
It is beautiful out here.
Is it really that dangerous?
It doesn't seem like a big deal.
What exactly do you do?
I'm an actuary. A risk-assessment professional, if we're being formal.
Well, Mr. Varnay,
hauling heavy cargo on ice in April is a big deal.
-See Custer's head there? -[tinkling] Tips us off to pressure waves.
Go to fast, you create a pressure wave.
In you go.
Go too slow and the ice can't handle the pounds per square inch on your tire.
In you go.
What the hell was that? Over.
Sounds like my head gasket.
Come on, damn it. Come on!
Sweet Jesus, that ain't good.
Shit.
Shit.
Whoa! What the hell are you doin'?
Going back.
I thought we weren't stopping for anything. You know, all that "bull run" stuff?
I said, "We're going back." Goddamn it!
Gurty's gonna run diagnostics while we hook up. We'll pull together.
Use the nylon snatch pulleys on the rear, so the rigs can swing!
Is this, uh… [laughs nervously] This gonna work?
How, uh… How far are we gonna… gonna tow him, all the way to the mine?
How far are we gonna… gonna tow him, all the way to the mine?
Do us all a favor, Mr. Varnay, and get back in your truck.
[mutters] Shit. Come on.
Gurney!
Clear out!
What happened?
Rear trailer tires went in.
Oh, shit!
What the hell's going on?
Come on, Jim.
-Jim! -Tow line's got me!
-Jim! -Tow line's got me! Cut me loose! My leg's broken!
Cut me loose or you're all goin' in! The tow line's got me, my leg's broken. Do it!
-Do it! -I can't!
Do it! Do it!
Jesus.
[Varnay] Holy shit!
[Mike] It's spreading out.
[Varnay] Meaning what?
Meaning it's gonna keep cracking for two, maybe three thousand meters.
That's over a mile!
We'll outrun it. Let's move.
We gotta unhook first. -[cracking continues] -There's no time!
We're gonna have to run tied together. Go.
-[dramatic music playing] -Get your harness on.
Mike, come in, we gotta hike up the speed, over.
[Mike on radio] Roger.
-Mike, come in. We gotta run faster. -Roger.
Gurty, running board.
Out, on the running board.
-Why? -So if we go through, we can jump clear.
Got a pressure wave ahead of me!
Well, I got one hell of an ice crack behind me here, so how do you wanna die?
Slush bed at 200 yards. Get in and buckle up.
Hang on, pal. This is gonna get ugly.
This is not good. This is not good. This is not good!
I don't like this!
-Shit! -[creaking]
I've got your seat belt. You okay, pal?
We're finished.
It stopped.
Yeah.
It stopped!
[Mike] We capsized for a reason.
Now our weight's displaced evenly instead of on the tires.
So based on seven liters per minute, per man--
Seven liters? That's all a grown man breathes?
When at rest. The figure doubles with physical exertion.
-Hey, Cody, can I ask you something? -Sure.
When the mine blew up, I said, "We hit a methane pocket."
And you said, "That's impossible." Why?
-Still settling. -[rumbling continues]
"Air compressor."
Thank God, they're coming through.
"Failed."
Hey, what's the story, Cody?
[grunts] Yeah.
What'd they say?
They say they're still working on it.
-[miner] Cody. -Yeah?
You didn't answer my question. Why is it impossible we hit a methane pocket?
'Cause I was told it would never happen.
By who?
Who told you that?
Cody.
-[miners coughing and clamoring] -[miner] Easy! Boys, easy! Get him out!
Easy!
[miner] Cody!
SOS, SOS, 41.40.
Ice road north of 53. Kenworth through the ice.
Repeat, Kenworth through the ice.
[dispatch on radio] Copy. Are there survivors?
Negative.
We are responding. Thank you.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. What… what about us?
What about us?
We're headin' back, right?
Back?
Yeah, that's what I said.
The ice is bound to be thinner to the south, not thicker.
We still have two deliverable wellheads. "Tactical redundancy," remember?
And we're more than halfway there. What do you think, Gurty?
Attaboy. You comin' with, Tantoo?
Hell yeah.
But this is ridiculous. You're all gonna die.
You wanna go back? Go back.
I suggest you do it quick.
Nichiiwad, "the big one."
Drop 50 degrees, we'll pick up eight to ten centimeters of new ice.
Let's get the rigs upright and haul ass. We're back in business!
You're out of your minds! All of you!
Wait, wait, wait.
-It appears you're the new leader here-- -I'm not the leader of anything.
Everyone's on their own.
Fine. Whatever.
You're not curious about back there, what happened?
We saw what happened. I'm talking about the seized-up engine.
Go on.
How well do you know her? Tantoo?
Met her first time yesterday. Why?
Mind answering a couple of questions?
You worked for Jim Goldenrod, what, two years?
Two and a half.
Why'd it end?
I used his rig on the weekend without permission.
-So you're a thief? -I'm not a thief.
Hey, I was hauling banners for a demon--
What is this your business?
You weren't a happy camper, were you? When he fired you.
No, I…
Look, just--
I've never seen a Kenworth with less than 10K on the odometer just up and quit.
I've never seen a Kenworth with less than 10K on the odometer just up and quit. -Have you? -No.
[Mike] Most diesel engines don't seize on their own
unless they burn gasoline.
What's this about?
You dosed Goldenrod's rig with gas while we were loading up.
I saw you next to the pump. [laughs] You said you were checking the tire pressure.
[laughs] You said you were checking the tire pressure. That is a goddamn lie!
You were gonna take us all out, weren't you?
-So you could claim the whole 200 grand. -No!
-I don't know what you're talking about! -Who else, then?
It wasn't me, it wasn't Gurty, it wasn't him.
He works for the company that's paying us.
This is not about the money for me, you idiots!
God, my brother is in that mine!
And the longer we stand here, the closer he is to dying, so if you could just move--
[chuckles] She's lying. You can't trust these people.
[scoffs] Call Katka! His name is Cody Mantooth. We had different fathers.
His name is Cody Mantooth. We had different fathers.
God, "these people"?
-You're a racist asshole-- -You're not going anywhere.
-Look, just get out of-- -You're not going anywhere.
-Look, just get out of-- -You're not going anywhere. -Fine! -[Mike] Hey, hey, hey.
-Fine! -[Mike] Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-We call the company and check your story. -Yeah, and then go fuck yourself!
Tie her up, Gurty.
Yeah. Tully, it's Mike.
I just heard about Goldenrod from County Emergency. What happened?
We think Tantoo dosed Jim's rig with gasoline.
Are you kidding? That's worse than putting sugar in the tank!
Contact Katka.
Ask them if there's a miner, Cody Mantooth, on the missing list.
-I'll explain later. -You got it.
We want to discuss options.
Like what?
Like decreasing our numbers.
I want to talk to the folks upstairs. I want to talk to the bosses.
You don't know tap code.
He does.
You guys can't be serious.
It's called "triage." Hospitals do it all the time.
We decrease our numbers by one third and our oxygen window increases--
We can do the math.
Hospitals are a bullshit analogy.
Patients get triaged when it's determined they die anyway.
And what about these guys?
[Mankins] They're not gonna make it till morning.
[Lampard] Well, no one's goin' for this.
I agree. It's nuts.
-Say you're wrong. -Say we're not.
Say we put it to a vote.
[miner] What's he sayin', Cody?
-[Cody] They want to decrease our numbers. -Can't be serious.
Look serious to me, Claude.
Nobody wants this, Barney. Don't make it personal.
Hate to tell you, friend, this is about as personal as it gets.
Have you guys seen yourselves?
Barney, that compound fracture has sepsis in it.
And you, Claude, how's that fever treatin' ya?
You're not gonna make it another 12 hours. -What if we say no? -It's goin' to a vote.
-What if we say no? -It's goin' to a vote.
That's like two foxes and a chicken voting on what's for dinner.
I always knew you were a prick, Mankins. Didn't know till now you were also a murderer.
"Suggest decreasing our number."
What does that mean? They mean decreasing their number.
-Well, how? -How do you think?
No.
What? No!
No, that's crazy! I'm not taking part in this.
We're not callin' the shots down there, Fred.
[Mike] Hey! Those trailers smacked down hard.
Gurty and I are gonna go check the loads, then we'll push on.
How's she lookin'?
-Hey! Hey! -[slams]
-Hey! -[Gurty] Hey! Help!
-[Mike] Open the damn door! -[Gurty clamoring]
-[clamoring continues muffled] -[Mike] Hey!
[Mike muffled] Open the damn door!
You piece of shit. Insurance actuary, my ass.
What do you actually do for Katka?
Let's just say I work in a different department of the company.
Yeah, the sewer.
[chuckling] Look. Here's the rules.
You behave yourself
and you can stay in the restraints that those idiot truckers put on ya.
But you get a little spirited, which I know is a problem for you people,
and I will hog-tie you, and throw you in the rear.
-Yeah? -[Tully] Mike, what's your status?
-No, it's Varnay! We're stuck in a storm! -I've got an answer on that Cody--
I can't… I can't talk!
[Mike] Please work. Please work.
She's outfitted with a heater unit.
Hey, Gurty. How heavy do we think this double mill pipe is?
Five mill, double hundred.
Eh?
Three, four, zero.
Three-forty each? Grab hold of the end of this one.
We're gonna punch that out.
Punch pipe the pin post.
My thoughts exactly!
[Mike] Easy. Easy.
-Easy. -[grunting]
One, two, three.
-[Mike] One, two, three! -[Gurty yells]
-[both yelling] -[Mike] One, two, three…
One, two, three!
[Mike] Yes!
[Gurty] No, no, no, no!
He took the phone, the pistol, our gear bags.
-[Gurty] And the Too. -And the what?
Tantoo.
Tantoo as well.
Let's figure this out.
What's the matter with you?
Ease off!
-[dramatic music building] -[Mike] More!
Hike up the pressure!
Gurty!
I said more!
More!
-[engine shuts off] -Jeez.
I said more!
Mike!
Yeah, I see it! It's called a winch!
Mike, welding's a winter snap!
What?
Welding's not cold!
Just do it!
Do you know why we get fired?
It's not your disability, it's your freakin' attitude!
You probably didn't take orders before your disability!
I don't know what's goin' on here.
But that prick, he killed Goldenrod, and he nearly killed us.
He pinned it all on Tantoo,
who's out here to save her brother, and we helped him!
We have one chance!
One chance to get out of this and make this right.
And you're not gonna wreck it. Not this time.
-[winch turning] -Don't you dare touch that!
Come on, come on, come on!
She's coming free!
What the hell was that?
Gurty? Gurty?
Gurty!
Gurty!
Gurty!
[anxiously] Come on, Gurty. Come on. Breathe. Breathe.
Come on, Gurty. Work with me here.
-[sputtering and gasping] -Oh, jeez.
Gurty.
-[laughing] -[coughing] Gurty.
-[coughing] -Jesus. Here, pal. Here, pal.
Here, pal. I got you. I got you.
-I got you. -[shuddering]
-I got you. -[coughing]
Gurty, I'm sorry. [voice breaking] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hit you. I'm sorry.
[voice breaking] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hit you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to… I… I'm sorry, Gurty.
I didn't mean to… I… I'm sorry, Gurty.
Mike… [coughs violently]
Yeah. Sunken dreams, Gurty.
Sunken dreams.
Yeah. It's eating at me too.
Why would an employee of the company that hired us sabotage…
They want us to fail.
That's it. They want us to fail. I didn't see it.
I've been… too wrapped up in what's in this for us.
Oh, well, now I'm angry.
Let's get out of here.
It's not about money now.
This is personal.
It should be 20 minutes to the shoreline.
Rig Two's in the lake 20 klicks due south.
Took the mechanic and the driver with it.
I told them not to store dynamite in the trailer, due to friction detonation, but, uh…
due to friction detonation, but, uh… they had other ideas.
Good. Good. That's good.
How about the driver?
Well, she's alive, sir.
Put the cab through that guardrail up there.
Your story is she lost control,
you dove for safety before it went over. You clear?
Clear, sir.
The miners' oxygen window closes in three hours,
so the press is gonna be all over us.
They need to be told our valiant rescue had a tragic end.
I'll make it happen, sir.
Good. Good.
You call me when it's done.
If you do this, it's on your head.
You wanna blame someone? Blame management.
What has management got to do with it?
-All those in favor raise their arms-- -Mankins!
I asked you a question.
Because they made us cut the damn sensors, René.
They what?
They claim the new quotas were killin' them, so they couldn't afford a shutdown.
And they said there was, "No chance of gas pockets this far north."
And they sweetened the deal.
[Lampard] How much?
Hundred dollars per man, per month.
You turned off the gas sensors for a hundred dollars a month?
And anyone who blew the whistle'd get shitcanned.
None of that matters now, René.
Our oxygen is falling fast.
There's a vote on the floor. All those in favor, raise your hands.
No.
Hey!
How much methane you think is in here now?
Huh?
These men are not the enemy.
-The enemy's up there. -Bullshit!
-The enemy's up there. -Bullshit! The enemy's asphyxiation.
We're getting out of here together or not at all.
You're one stupid son of a bitch, René.
You too, Cody.
Maybe so,
but this is how it's gonna be.
Right here.
Let's clear the road.
Ow!
-Yeah, that's what I thought. -You're never gonna get away with this.
-Yeah, that's what I thought. -You're never gonna get away with this. You know there's gonna be an investigation.
That's the plan.
What is that?
Thanks.
Mayday, mayday!
[on radio] Mayday, come in! Anybody, come in! Mayday, mayday!
Mayday! Is anybody out there?
[on radio] Tantoo, it's Mike.
We're comin' up the pass. Where are you?
Approaching the upper traverse.
I got Varnay behind me with others, they're all armed.
We've got two hours to get to Katka and I'm still pullin' weight.
-They're tryin' to stop us. -Yeah, we figured.
Cody always said that they cut corners with the methane regs.
Those bastards, they caused the cave-in, now they're tryin' to cover it up.
Not gonna happen. Just hang on.
Not gonna happen. Just hang on. We're comin'.
Take 'em out so it will pass forensics! No bullet holes!
Do not discharge your weapon!
Oh, shit!
Come on, one more mile! We can do one more mile, come on!
Yeah, we can do it. Come on.
Pull over!
Pull over now!
Pull over!
If they were gonna shoot us, they would've done it by now.
Yeah, good. Come on.
Ready, bro?
Pull over now!
Well, don't just stand there. Let's go.
Come on, come on, don't stop, don't stop. Don't you dare stop. Come on.
[mutters] Don't do this to me. Don't… [whispers] Don't do this.
-[engine rattling] -No, keep going! Don't stop! Come on, you piece of shit! Let's go!
-[engine chugging] -No, I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!
Don't think that I'm not gonna use this on you!
What's your game?
Oh, what, are you just gonna stand there?
Yeah.
This is the last wellhead.
What are you gonna do? You gonna push it the rest of the way?
'Cause if you're gonna make it to Katka before your brother stops breathing,
that's what you're gonna have to do.
The other drivers are gonna come.
The other drivers are dead.
[Tantoo] He ripped out my fuel equalizer.
-Gurty can fix that. -[crashing continues]
We'll change out your fuel line
and siphon enough juice to get you down to Katka.
Listen.
We…
We seriously misjudged you.
Friends?
Yeah.
Hey, how long do you think all this is gonna take?
A couple of minutes.
-I know you're anxious about your brother. -Yeah.
Cody's all I got, you know? It's kinda like you and yours.
Yeah.
Gurty's like that commercial.
-"Takes a lickin', but keeps on tickin'." -[Tantoo laughs]
Hey, that last can should do it.
He saved my life. Give him a treat.
We can't stay here and we can't back up.
-We'll have to outrun it. -You're dreaming.
-We'll have to outrun it. -You're dreaming. You got a better idea?
-Oh… -Uncouple the trailer. We got a wellhead to deliver.
Oh, jeez.
[Tantoo] It's not as bad as it looks.
[Mike] It's, uh…
It looks pretty bad, kid.
[exhales] Just be fast about it.
-[Mike] Ah. -Like pulling out a wisdom tooth.
"A wisdom tooth." Do I… do I look like a dentist?
-[Tantoo gasping] -Good girl. Good girl.
-Breathe. Breathe. That's it. -[breathing slowly]
Good girl. Good girl.
Gurty, come and help me!
-[Tantoo groaning] -Good girl. Good girl.
Come on.
Hang tight.
Gurty and I are gonna haul your trailer off the cliff, hook up, and head to that mine.
We still got 45 minutes.
Sir! Mine Safety down in Winnipeg wants René's laptops.
Fred, Mine Safety gets the laptops when I say they get the laptops, all right?
Got a goddamn CEO to worry about.
Yeah, well, you can tell him yourself, he'll be here in an hour.
[scoffs] There is nothin' in those emails that implicates us.
Everything was cash, there was no paper trail.
To the authorities, this just looks like another tragic mining accident.
Right in the morning, we open Tunnel Six.
We remove the bodies. We let the public hold their ritual funerals.
We weather the obligatory occupational hazard debate.
And we open back up.
Business as usual.
Come on, Varnay. Answer the goddamn phone.
Look, Gurty, we did it.
We did it!
Mike. Mike.
Give me that pistol!
Gurty, you gotta take the wheel. Come on, you can do it.
Do not stop until you reach the mine. Got it?
Do not stop.
Hey. Kill him. Not for me, for my brother.
-[tense music continues] -[engine idling]
Look, I've done this a thousand times.
Move. I can do it.
Ah, shit.
Traction pads! Yes, go!
Come on, come on, come on.
Shit. Shit.
Gurty! The cable's are snapping! Let's go! Come on!
Oh, shit. Holy shit.
[Tantoo] Gurty, shut the gate!
Gurty!
Gurty!
[Mike] Gurty!
Gurty!
He saved the rig. [Mike] Oh, Jesus.
[weakly] Mike, you… brother mine.
[weakly] My brother..
Brother mine.
[sobbing] No, no, no, no.
No.
I'm sorry.
[crying] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
[Tager] Deputy Minister, Jack Tager, Vice President Operations.
-George Sickle, General Manager. -[Tager] Sir.
-Sickle. -How are you, sir?
-It's cold up here. -We have hot drink and food inside, sir.
How was that drive down from, uh, Gillam Airfield?
Cut the formalities, Sickle. Tell me the situation.
Our, uh, last contact with the rescue team was 0300.
Uh, Deputy Minister, how about you? Your, uh… Your man in Winnipeg. Heard anything?
Negative.
[man] It's been 30 hours and the wellheads haven't arrived.
I don't believe the men are gonna get out of Tunnel Six alive.
What's that?
Uh, that's our emergency klaxon.
Oh, my God.
Hey. Welcome to Katka.
You McCann?
Yeah.
You need medical?
Everyone on the double! We still have a chance.
We got another one. Need a gurney, ASAP.
There's no hurry.
[Fred] We need to get that wellhead unloaded and bolted down, let's go!
Straight to the drill site! Go, go, go!
Wellhead team, let's go! You're up!
[worker] Got it!
Wellhead is tapped and sprung.
All right, blasting team, Tunnel Six on the double!
-Young lady, you're in no condition to-- -I don't give a shit!
Put a Band-Aid on it. I heard blasting, I'm gonna go find Cody. -Tantoo! Tantoo! -What?
We're outside the oxygen window. We didn't make it in time.
Don't say that!
Look, Gurty died so that the miners would live, okay?
My brother is alive, I'm gonna find him. Let's go.
[worker] Someone's comin' out!
Cody!
You're alive! -Oh, my God. -You saved my life.
I had help.
Thank you.
You paid them?
You paid them to shut off their sensors?
You're disgusting.
Mr. McCann?
I'm Deputy Minister of Natural Resources for Canada.
I want to thank you and to offer condolences for your brother.
The company has some papers for you to sign.
We have a check for you and the police need your statement.
Excuse me, Mr. McCann?
We found this with your brother's things.
Thank you.
-Brand new Kenworth, huh? -Yup.
It's a good color. In honor of Jim.
What ya haulin'?
-Sporting goods. -Oh.
-Ain't that the life. -Yup.
No bosses. No punching time clocks.
-Good pay rates. -Yeah.
Well, find yourself pining for the ice road, you know where to find me.
Deal.
1.6-million-dollar prize pool!
I'm double-checking to make sure they haven't changed any details since last time.
they haven't changed any details since last time.
One million in US dollars for first prize.
That is for the winner. One million dollars for winning Dota!
It's gonna be huge. Dota2.com. The tournament tab is up, too.
Our website will actually change for the next 24 hours as well, so you get to read all the details…
[hyhy] The day I transformed into an adult was the day I started playing Dota.
It's times like, when you go up on the stage,
you represent your country for something.
You get the prize.
It's the amount of satisfaction and achievement that nothing else can give you.
It's something I definitely don't regret ever doing.
Gaming is simply the proudest thing in my life.
[Dendi] It can be called "gamer," but for me, it's something different.
One way to forget about pain is to do something that you will be in completely.
So… computer games.
For me, it was… everything.
[Fear] This is my career. I've chosen to do it for so long.
Success in my eyes is always based off on how other people see you.
In the eyes of the public, it's up to them.
[hyhy] It's important to be doing things that you love and you really appreciate,
because that's your passion, man.
You should… you should really work for your passions. Yeah.
Okay, guys, you have… you have seven minutes to set everything up and then we go.
to set everything up and then we go.
[Fear] This is the first time I wanted to take something seriously
and do something good for my life.
[Troels] Ten years ago, competitive gaming wasn't even really a thing.
You'd play for fun against your friends. Maybe you would play for a cup of coffee or whatever you wanted.
[Alexander] When I started playing, we'd been fighting for 24 bottles of beer as a first place.
we'd been fighting for 24 bottles of beer as a first place.
I'm not joking.
[Jon] From there, though, online happened.
And, all of a sudden, you weren't just trying to be the best on your block.
[Jon] Now you're trying to be the best in the world.
And that opened up competitive gaming to a whole new landscape.
And one of the games really leading the way is Dota.
[Liu] Dota is sort of a combination of football, or soccer for the Americans, and chess.
This is probably how I would try to explain Dota
to someone who's not familiar with it.
At least, that's what I did to my parents.
[host] Dota is a game of momentum.
You as five players
try and battle against the other five players for momentum.
Every single player controls one unit.
And the main objective of the game is to destroy the final enemy building
which is called the "Ancient."
[host] Everything else that happens in the meantime,
is your amazing filler of a game.
[Jeremy] You could play 100 heroes in conjunction with 99 other heroes.
It's just nonstop, uh, possibilities and it's so much fun.
And, you know, it's like the same map every single time
but it literally never gets boring.
[Jeremy] I would say Dota is a way of life.
[Clement] When prizes started coming, I was like, "Well, we have tournaments."
So obviously some people are gonna come and say, "This is a great game. Let's play it. Like, let's put money in it."
"This is a great game. Let's play it. Like, let's put money in it."
[Clement] And it started progressing each year.
[Tammy] Those at the top level, they just do like lots of calculations in their head.
Something like A Beautiful Mind where you see like all kinds of things.
[Tammy] And using all this information, make your next move.
I see it in a lot of ways similar to basketball.
Just like a five-on-five game where you kind of have to work together
and utilize each other's strengths and synergizing everything together.
The teamwork, and the trust, and the sacrifice,
those are all true for every single team sport.
Dota is a game that unites everybody.
It doesn't matter what country or from what race you are.
It's like a bond that is shared.
And when you're part of this tight-knit group of people,
it's like having a second family.
That's something you never let go.
[Tammy] Everyone's searching for something.
Fulfillment. Fame.
Satisfaction.
It gives you the ability to become someone else.
A someone who is powerful.
Who can take down five opponents.
Express their creativity.
Break the rules without actually getting arrested.
All of these reasons are in there somewhere.
The player himself might not even know. He might not even understand it himself.
But it's there.
[Fear] Gaming fulfills my competitive need.
I'm a very competitive person.
When it comes to sports, I consider gaming a sport.
So I use my competitiveness and I fuel it with Dota.
So it fulfills that side of me completely.
Fear's one of the best in America, if not the best.
He has a lot of experience. He's one of the old hogs, basically.
And he's generally just a calm guy. So, in my opinion, that's his strength.
Really, good basketball player. I remember my coaches watch him playing
and talk about picking him up the next year he came in.
Always had nothing but good things to say, but he wasn't picked on the team.
Just the reason was, yeah, he just wasn't tall enough, I guess.
So, I know that, yeah, he found the game. He got really devoted in that and stuff and just found something else that worked.
He got really devoted in that and stuff and just found something else that worked.
[Karen] I was your typical parent.
"Clinton, you're spending too much time playing computer games."
"You need to go to school. You need to go to college."
[Karen] And he would tell me,
"I want to be able to play games and get paid for it."
Now, he said this at a very young age before Dota ever came along.
[Karen] And I thought, well, you know, he's gonna grow out of it.
He's gonna get sick and tired of sitting there in front of that computer and playing.
Never did. Never did.
[hyhy] In Singapore, the families actually put a lot of stress on us
in terms of our education.
I would say it's been tough on me trying to juggle both studies and gaming at the same time.
trying to juggle both studies and gaming at the same time.
My grades have dropped for two years already.
And my parents have treated the gaming as the cause of it.
I mean, there was this phrase that they used. They said, "Gaming will be the death of you one day."
-[indistinct chatter] -[all cheer]
[Toh] He's a great player and a great captain.
I would say he's the top player in Singapore.
Easily.
[hyhy] My parents and my… my family,
they don't actually speak much of my gaming career.
They don't tell their friends and my other relatives
that I'm actually that good at my games.
All along they have only been bragging about my studies.
Because I used to be an "A" student.
Yeah, they go on and on. And…
And it seemed like that was the only thing they could ever be proud of.
[hyhy] Actually, there has only been one person
that has always been very supportive of me gaming.
And that was, uh, my ex-girlfriend, Huayan.
She's from the female Dota team in Singapore.
There are a lot of things that we share in life. So many things.
In my case, it felt really good, you know, to have someone
who truly appreciated what you did best and loved you for it.
She was aware of what I'm doing and what I'm passionate about.
The breakup was her decision and I respected it.
We'd been together for close to three years
and ever since the breakup, I haven't gotten over it.
I recall the last time she spoke to me she named me as a bastard, so… Um… [chuckles]
We're not in contact anymore, yeah, but…
life goes on, yeah.
[Dendi] I'm from Ukraine. My nickname is Dendi.
I finished my university,
and I'm just playing computer games right now.
[in Russian] He was doing music. He played the piano.
[Irina, in Russian] He was doing dancing.
At school, he had musical plays in which he played the main role.
Audiences were always impressed by his artistic ability.
When their kids' group was showing, Danil would always stand out.
[Katya] When we were growing up,
it wasn't a good time financially for our family.
But my grandma helped us to get our first computer in 1997.
Early, compared with other kids in Ukraine.
We got visitors every day.
The friends of my older brother used to come to visit us
and we were playing games.
[Artem] And Danil, every time looked at what we do.
Every time we would try to push him away but he would come back and look again.
[Irina, in Russian] It was more prominent with him than with other kids.
During all his conscious life we were trying to stop him from playing.
[Katya] We were hiding our computer cord everywhere in our apartment,
but he always found it.
[in Russian] I always wanted to understand him better.
Including that hobby, I wanted to understand him better.
[Irina, in Russian] There were certain reasons. I'm not going to mention them now.
I think somewhere deep inside he's a little bit sad.
[Katya] Uh, she stopped preventing him from playing Dota.
She gave Dendi the freedom to choose what is the best for him and his life.
[Dominik] Tournaments back then were like really low prizes.
And a lot of prize money didn't even get to the players.
There's been a lot of scams with the managers and stuff like that.
[Dominik] There were, like, some rumors that it's gonna be, like, 50,000 dollars, first place,
and everyone was going, like, "Nah, it's not gonna be like that."
[host] Watch the forums go nuts, guys.
Watch the forums go nuts.
It is actually confirmed.
It is off the fricking hook.
1.6-million-dollar prize pool!
That is for the winner, one million dollars for winning Dota!
[Rasmus] Dota, the game I've played for five years now, which I played for fun,
for some food money or whatever, you know, okay, it's actually getting big.
It's the largest prize pool of any gaming competition to date.
[Tammy] It just felt like the start of something big.
Like a revolution.
[Rasmus] You know, we had everything we needed
for the game to become big and respected as an E-Sport.
It would kind of like vindicate us.
[Tammy] We're not just playing because we're addicted.
There's a goal, a motive.
That we can actually reach out and grab if we are good enough.
Over in Asia, professional gamers are treated like rock stars.
It's a viable career opportunity.
They actually live in gamer houses.
So it's set up to be a thing all year long.
I think their approach to practice is that it's like a day job.
[Liu] The fan base is immense.
It probably is as big as the whole Western audience together.
Or even more than that.
So now you really have to play good. You really have to try hard.
[Fear] It's first place. It's go big or go home.
The big teams get big money.
But the 9th to 16th place earn nothing.
And their salaries are not worth considering.
While in sports, you have a salary that you can live on.
[Jeremy] With pro gaming, I think that's one of the toughest parts
is living game to game. It's like living paycheck to paycheck.
Like, I have to win. If I don't win, I don't get paid.
[Jeremy] That's tough for anybody. It doesn't matter what you're doing.
[Karen] When your child wants to become a professional gamer,
you don't have any history to look back on like other sports.
I don't know anybody who's made a living at gaming.
So it's kind of a scary thing
when you see your kid putting their whole life into gaming
and not college and not the traditional things.
[Karen] What if nothing comes of it?
[Alexander] Regarding the age, I think, yes,
like, 25, 26 years. It's absolutely maximum for E-Sports.
[Alexander] Because 27, 28, 29, 30, your reaction time is lowering
and you can't click so much, you know…
[chuckles] …as the kids do.
A lot of financial responsibilities are laid upon me right now.
Require me to be successful in something or have a job.
So it's pretty critical that I am successful
if I wanna keep continue, like, the gaming career.
He's an A-Star student, you know?
Because of this gaming, it pulled him right down.
It's very sad for me.
[Vicky] So here… the bad one is Auntie.
Auntie is the one that always comes here and nag, nag, nag, nag, nag. Yeah.
-Am I right? -It's tough being a gamer.
-Huh? Sorry? Am I right? -I said, it's tough being a gamer.
Huh, hy? Why? Multi-millionaire.
For gaming, huh?
Huh? Sorry, you are not.
Huh? What, what is your view? What is your plan?
That is more important. I mean, we speak ourselves. We speak our frank opinion.
I mean, we speak ourselves. We speak our frank opinion. This is your choice now.
What do you want in life? That is more important.
[hyhy] If I'm gonna win this tournament, my first thought would be,
I will call my… my ex-girlfriend.
Things got really bad between us, and…
but right now, for me, if I'm gonna win this tournament,
my first thought would be, I would call her.
I'd tell her about it, and…
I want to share this moment with her. Yeah.
[James] This tournament is gonna be a moment in every gamer's life.
Everything that you've been doing is building up
and is gonna happen over one week.
[James] And then it's not one week anymore, it's one game.
And then it's not that one game, it's that one moment in the game.
And then that one moment in the game is where it's gonna finish.
And how's it gonna finish? Are you gonna be holding up a trophy?
Or are you gonna be the most disappointed that you've ever been?
It's Tuesday. So one day before the event. We already have a lot of setup.
We have a lot of computer setup right here.
The whole booth construction is pretty much finished.
So five players per side. They can see each other through the glass.
[host] They can't hear each other. This booth is soundproofed up.
Plus, the whole setup here,
if you look from above looks exactly like a Dota map.
[host] And this is the mid. This is where it all happens.
[Moritz] A few teams have already arrived this morning.
We had a lot of teams from Singapore. We have China.
We had Malaysia coming in and Russia.
And, uh, tomorrow it's finally happening.
[host] We're here live at Gamescom 2011 in beautiful Cologne.
It's the first day of the event.
We've got some of the world's best teams here in Dota.
And they're handing out a tournament prize of 1.6 million dollars!
[host] It is massive here.
A tournament of 1.6 million dollars. That's the future of gaming.
This is awesome!
[host] It's the first time we're gonna see teams of this caliber assembled in one location.
These guys are not just nameless faces. They're the best in the world.
[Troels] The bunch of teams we have here, there's a few teams that have individual skill that's unbelievable.
And then there's a big group of other teams
that have good individual skill, not top-notch,
but who win through good strategy and team play.
[Troels] Fear is a great player, for example,
but he is not comparable to good players in Asia.
that's nothing against Fear. He's still an excellent player, but he's not them.
[commentator] "Kim Jung Woo!"
[James] Over in Asia, they take gaming so much more seriously.
Just to give you an example, the Korean football team were playing in the World Cup.
[James] To motivate the Korean football team to play better,
they brought in StarCraft: Brood War professional gamers
into their locker room before they went out so that they got to meet what were their heroes.
[Tammy] In China, Dota is to the people there what StarCraft is to Korea.
Um, it's televised.
The girls like their boyfriends to be Dota players.
After a game, when they're walking around you can see fans running up to them
asking them to sign on their shirts.
It's like a real sport.
The third time I was in China, I was playing with fans for two days.
[Rasmus] They made a video of me, filming me walking in some mountains
and I had to say some sentences and stuff.
And I was like, yeah, "In Dota, there's always a new mountain to climb."
Stuff like this, you know, and, uh…
I walked up and down these stairs
and started running and lifting some weights,
just to compare this with Dota like some metaphor and stuff.
[Tang, in Chinese] E-Sports in China is already a sport that is recognized
that is recognized by the General Administration of Sport.
It is the same as tennis, ping pong, chess.
The only thing is that it is not an Olympic sport.
[hyhy] I will say that China teams are all great.
Every player in the team is strong.
You don't recognize China players as a player.
You just recognize them as a whole team. You just fear the whole team.
[James] The Chinese teams that have come to this competition
are scaring the shit out of everyone else.
We had two of the top Chinese teams in our group.
[Liu] Online Kingdom has not been regarded as one of the favorites to win it.
In fact, they were considered bottom four or just bottom eight for sure.
[Fear] This is our first time on LAN together.
The team together has only been around for around four-five months
so it's a relatively new team.
And Pajkatt, our newest addition, playing Carry for us,
he's only been on the team for three weeks now actually.
[Fear] We were really nervous going against a Chinese team
especially the top Chinese teams. [James] There's gonna be players that choke
[James] There's gonna be players that choke handling this kind of pressure at such a young age.
[Fear] 1437, like, this is the first time he's, like, ever been on LAN.
It's not easy, like, this is a million-dollar tournament.
First time he's been on LAN.
[James] This stage. This prize money. This prestige. This is real competition.
[Fear] We tried to keep our cool together and we just played our game.
Passive shields!
[Dominik] We were super hyped.
Everyone was surprised we were doing so good.
Even we couldn't believe it.
[host] Online Kingdom dominating right now.
[Fear] After the match against TyLoo, everyone was very excited, you know.
We just beat one of the teams that were actually favored to win the competition.
So everyone's, like, spirits were like,
"Oh, we may be actually able to do this, you know."
Beating the Chinese teams, some people just, you know, for fun, they started,
"Okay, hey, it's OK.Nirvana.Int. They're the China slayers."
[Liu] A few little bit surprises that we had yesterday. Quite a few upsets.
OK.Nirvana.International managing to beat two Chinese teams in a row,
beating out TyLoo and OK.Nirvana.CN.
[Liu] They're currently on a roll now. And, um, Chinese teams are not unbeatable.
But, um, on the other hand,
EHOME are just proving that they are the strongest of the four Chinese teams
having a clean 3-0 record. They are the favorites to win the whole tournament.
So they come in with the confidence that they've won so many championships already.
[Liu] It's always a little bit of national pride at stake. So, of course, they wanna prove that Chinese Dota
So, of course, they wanna prove that Chinese Dota is still a little bit above the rest.
[Liu] EHOME is one of the oldest Chinese Dota organizations.
They've always been at the top of competitive gaming.
Most memorably at ESWC 2010.
[Pajkatt] Before ESWC 2010,
I thought, "Okay, the Chinese, they're probably pretty good,
but like, how good can they be?"
[Pajkatt] And then we played EHOME who won that tournament without losing a single match.
Like, they just crushed every team.
[Liu] EHOME finished the year as the best team in the history of Dota.
[Pajkatt] They were on a totally different level.
Like, they had their manager sitting behind them. He was making their calls.
Like, they had their manager sitting behind them. He was making their calls. He was running around with this little black book.
And they were the first team I heard of who did that.
[James] The EHOME manager copying down the draft, doing the prep work.
He was their coach.
There was a great interview that was done.
And it lined up all the top European captains who attended
and the topic was EHOME.
If you want to ever play good, you don't need to invite Chinese teams
-because they are too strong. -[laughter]
[interviewer] So EHOME won, uh…
What do you think of, of the Chinese guys?
I never felt this outplayed in my entire life.
Uh, it's unbelievable how good they are. Like, their timing, their discipline…
They're in control of the whole game, and they keep this control all the time.
This is really crazy to see, actually.
[in Chinese] It's because when we are at any international tournament,
when all of the foreign team managers and team members see us,
everyone will all yell out, "EHOME!"
EHOME! EHOME!
[in Chinese] Do you know how spectacular that is?
Actually, this is a story. It's a custom.
[Tang, in Chinese] Which is when everyone sees EHOME,
they naturally think the king is entering.
[hyhy] During this trip to The International,
it's actually the same period as my exam periods.
So I treated it as a sacrifice that I've made… that I've made
for the team and for myself.
And I find that when it comes to pursuing your passions
it's really up to you to decide if it's worth, uh… worth the sacrifice.
When they're having exams, they don't allow him to leave the school
So I told him really I said, "Mind yourself."
[hyhy] Setting out on a career in gaming is risky. It's very risky.
Because the examinations actually clash with the competition
and missing the exams without a proper explanation,
the school didn't recognize the Dota competition as a valid reason.
[hyhy] It's kind of breaking school rules.
The school is determined to stop him from pursuing his chance of going for this contest.
his chance of going for this contest.
[Edwin] So I, I think this has created a big stress for the family.
Gives his mother very headache, you know?
[Vicky] It's quite difficult for us to pull him out right now, I think.
You know, he's so adamant about it.
So that's why when he told me he's going in August,
I said, "Then how about your school exams?
What are you going to do?"
[hyhy] I think my mother, she was kind of at her limits,
telling me about how much gaming has been weighing me down.
That was really the talk when I really opened my heart, and I…
shared with her my passion for the game and how much I believed that.
[hyhy] My team actually has the potential to win, to be the best in the world.
So we are stopping at nothing less than first.
This is how I tried to put it across to my mom.
By giving up so much to come here I have absolute confidence in my team that we will win.
[host] All right, the draft is under way.
EHOME, they will select up their heroes. Scythe will start selecting theirs.
Looking now at both the teams, it looks like EHOME,
Looking now at both the teams, it looks like EHOME, they're fairly relaxed while Scythe, you know, they're eager.
They're all gathering around hyhy to pick.
[hyhy] If you have a losing draft, you will lose the game.
This is what I think of Dota.
So it's really a lot on, on drafting.
[host] Drafting is where two captains will select what they want to play with.
What heroes are selected and what heroes are taken out.
You can select five heroes out of a pool of over a hundred,
and can also remove four of those heroes.
So four heroes you think your opponent will want to use,
you can remove.
[hyhy] Before any game, any match, we will decide our bans and picks according to which team we are fighting.
we will decide our bans and picks according to which team we are fighting.
Usually, we would come up with a very impromptu strategy
to try and fight their strat.
You really have to spend a lot of time thinking of the draft.
The draft actually decides a lot of the game itself.
[host] EHOME. They're a team with so much experience.
They already know the way they want to roll this one out.
The only thing that's gonna make it or break it
is if they can get their execution right.
[hyhy] In that particular match-up, we felt that we needed something
[hyhy] In that particular match-up, we felt that we needed something that could instill the fear in them.
[host] And Tiny looks to be the last pick up here from Scythe.
A bit of an interesting pick up there by Scythe.
It's gonna start to change around their lanes completely now.
[host] With Tiny, it is good as a surprise strat.
If another team doesn't realize where he fits into the whole lineup,
then you can really throw the opposition off balance.
[host] He's moving away, but no, hyhy, he'll just turn around and pops the Lina.
I wanna point out right now that EHOME, they are not noobs.
This is just Scythe playing an amazing game.
[hyhy] When you have such a huge audience and you know that everyone is at home watching the game,
they have their hopes pinned on you and, and I feel that…
there's so much at, at stake.
[host] And they should be able to clean it up right now.
Tiny, he's gonna toss, he's gonna launch, and he definitely gets the kill.
We got 357 getting nailed out there.
Nature's Prophet gonna get the last hit in as well.
It's the entire team down for EHOME. This is GG.
-This is now a double-rax, at least. -[screams]
And EHOME, they're going to disconnect.
We have our first Winner's Bracket Finalist.
Scythe will advance.
EHOME will drop down into the Loser's Bracket,
and Scythe will now finish up this game.
Yeah, the one million is… Yeah, one million.
[chuckles] That's a lot.
It's gonna make my time playing this game all worth it.
[hyhy] Didn't think smoking would do me any good.
[man] When did you start smoking?
Two years back.
Two years back, uh…
[clears throat] Bad move.
[man] That seems to coincide with when you and your ex-girlfriend broke up.
[hyhy] On bad terms.
Seems like she's, she's moved on already.
Back then when she was playing the game it felt like we had something to… something we shared.
Yeah, but right now, it's like… tsk.
I think she's… I think she's following this event, but… probably.
This event's big. Yeah.
I hope I will get to make that phone call. Yeah.
Finally, I'll have something I'm proud of to tell her about.
Finally.
[James] When you played the Russians and the Ukrainians,
they were just the unpredictable teams.
I had no idea what the Russians were thinking. That was their best weapon.
[Dendi] Well, we're having fun. We're trying to relax.
We're trying to scare our opponents.
Mind games. Mind games. [chuckles]
[Dendi] I turn off my brain in the way of being scared of someone.
One of the things I reallly admire about him is how…
he hasn't really had an easy life,
[Tammy] but he's always so upbeat. He's always so cheerful.
[host] When he first came on the Dota scene, he looked like a 12-year-old boy.
Everyone was just, like, "Who is this kid?"
There's no way you can take this guy seriously.
And then he would destroy you in games!
[in Russian] I saw somewhere on the Internet,
how he works with the keyboard.
[Irina, in Russian] It really is mesmerizing.
[Irina, in Russian] I think Danil benefited from his piano playing
because his hands are absolutely amazing.
[Clement] He can make really good moves.
His moves, I think are unique, and they might win you the game.
But he wants to rely completely on skill.
He wants, like, an enemy against him
and he wants to kill him through skill, nothing more.
He wants to win the game.
His disadvantage is that he doesn't have patience. He wants to make those moves.
[host] He can get a little bit too silly in games.
He will try new and different things.
He will overextend in team fights because he believes he can get the kill.
[Clement] And his impatience can go too far and he might lose the game for us.
-[teammate] Team Na'Vi! -[all] Team Na'Vi!
[Toby] There it is, he's gonna go in. This should be the First Blood.
They got the Sprout on Sansheng as well. There's probably gonna be a double.
Dendi's ulti, it hits!
Dendi, Dendi, no. He's not… he cannot be.
This is Dendi through and through.
Starts with the Hex, goes to Cold Snap, he locks him in place!
Weaver really close to death! Manages to Timelapse back out again.
Dendi will TP back to safety.
So GG being called by iG. Na'Vi, they will take the game.
Our Winners Bracket Finalists are gonna be Na'Vi versus Scythe.
[Fear] Most teams that you see that have the most fan bases are full nationality.
Our team is all spread out across the world.
[Tammy] He does have it a little harder than us
because he doesn't really have this human support that we do.
[Fear] The hardest thing that I've had to really deal with in my life
is just trying to convince my family about my gaming career.
It's really, really difficult especially when you start out slow,
but you know there's a future for something and you put a lot of time into it,
and they keep telling you, "You should get a real job."
[Fear] I was born in the Los Angeles district in Lancaster, California.
I lived there with my dad and my mom. Around two years old, my dad left my mom.
He didn't really say anything. He just kind of…
He just packed up and left.
[Fear] She's had to raise us both while going to law school at the same time.
It wasn't real easy as far as just got out of law school,
didn't have a job, had huge student loans to pay back.
[Karen] This job came up and so we moved here on our own.
So I've been raising them by myself ever since.
So this is a photo album that I made for Clinton.
For-- as he was growing up, I put pictures in it as we went along.
My sons were both really active into sports
and they wanted to do a lot so I had to limit them.
They could choose two per season.
[Karen] That was maximum for me being able to get them to practice
and go watch their games. That was tough.
And Clinton sitting on Santa's lap, his brother, "Santa."
[Fear] My brother's more angry at my father for leaving than I am.
He thinks about him, he gets upset.
Compared to me, I just… I just block him out and pretend he doesn't exist.
[Karen] Ah, Clinton already starting, uh, video games here.
[Tony] He was sitting at his house, playing Dota.
Doing it competitively. Had a sponsored team and everything like that.
Uh, but I think that's when it probably started getting on his… his mom's nerves.
[Fear] I have a crazy sleeping schedule.
I'm on a European team, so sometimes I have to stay up pretty ridiculous hours
or wake up at ridiculous hours.
So the standard day for me is not so standard.
All the nights he'd be up and stuff, the dog would be up too with him
and that would keep her awake most of the nights
and this is kind of where the tension got pretty high.
[Karen] You know, this, this went on for years
and it came to the point where I just told him
I said, "You know what, you just need to go somewhere else."
[Fear] So I got kicked out of my house because of my gaming career, basically.
[Pete] When Clinton first moved in here,
he was looking for a desk and there wasn't anything in the room.
And I had a lot of stuff that we were getting ready to take to the dump.
[Pete] And Clinton went out there and he came back in with this green desk.
And he goes, "This is perfect!"
So I didn't have a monitor, so I went to my friend
and he had a spare CRT monitor.
So I got that, and then, obviously, I have two books here to hunch that up
so I can actually see the monitor, so it's kind of a ghetto setup.
Even when I go to competitions, I don't think I play like any differently on the nice setups compared to this one.
on the nice setups compared to this one.
Clinton's like, uh, the Rocky Balboa of Dota.
He's the… he's definitely one of the first big US players.
[Tony] And, honestly, I didn't even, even know he was that big.
[Theeban] In the North American scene, there weren't many good American players known back then.
Everybody respected Fear.
[Fear] A lot of the people I knew, they quit the game.
They moved on, stuff like that.
But I stuck with it so I ended up being like one of the oldest players.
[Troels] With all his years of experience and all his constant commitment to the game,
he's really shown that he doesn't give up.
[Fear] Growing up without my father, I think in the end, like…
[Fear] Growing up without my father, I think in the end, like… not having someone there to teach me of the guy side
and having a father to help you up,
I think that it's actually probably made me, like, the person I am today.
You know, I just make sure everything's running smoothly on the team.
I kind of play, like, the father figure, I guess.
[Jimmy] As a captain, I guess he felt he had that responsibility as well.
He was like pretty much my mentor.
He did tell me one time,
"Hey, if you need someone to talk to," you know, he would be here.
So I kind of see him as a Dota brother.
I've never had an ego, like, thinking that I'm better than anyone else.
I'm always there willing to help people who are new to the scene.
[Fear] And that's always been kind of my role in the game,
by just helping players get up, for the most part.
[Theeban] Fear actually broke me into the scene, you know.
It's very hard to get yourself out there.
I mean, back then, I was kind of like a fanboy of him.
You know, watching his games and whatnot.
[Theeban] And he gave me a shot to play at a high level.
I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Fear.
I can guarantee you that.
[Theeban] Going into the match, we were all thinking,
MUFC didn't do so well earlier, but…
If we lost that game, we wouldn't win anything, so…
it was a high-risk game.
[Toby] Thirty-six minutes in, almost a 7,000 gold advantage in favor of MUFC.
[Fear] Toward the end, we made a couple of mistakes that put two heroes on the sideline for us.
And they had all five still up and decided that they were gonna go for our Throne.
-They're probably gonna push for the base. -They're going GG!
-They want to go for the GG! -No Fortification!
[Theeban] We were really close to losing our Throne.
It's below 20 percent HP.
[Toby] And Online Kingdom, they are so close to the point of getting eliminated from this tournament!
We just needed to do something.
I'm going to go on them! I'm going to initiate on them!
[Fear] I ran in first and then they all went on me
instead of focusing on the Throne, which is good.
[Toby] Again by Silvercross.
Fear, he's trying to retreat. He turned into a pig.
How the hell is he still alive?
Go, go, go! Go, go!
[Toby] They push MUFC back!
We made this huge comeback where we killed all of their heroes.
[Theeban] You know, started pushing.
[Toby] Silvercross is down! Morphling! He's out of this!
The Top Rax will go!
There is no way now that MUFC can come back!
It will be Online Kingdom eliminating MUFC! What an incredible…
Our whole team just went crazy.
[Toby] Fear leading Online Kingdom to do the impossible.
I've never seen anything like that.
And stay tuned. We'll be back here for more exciting gameplay coming up.
We'll be back here for more exciting gameplay coming up.
[Dendi] Scythe. They are the 2008 ESWC winners.
One of the best Asian teams but we aren't afraid of them.
We're gonna fight them.
I don't know about my teammates, but I don't feel scared at all.
I feel like I want to crush my enemy.
That's how I feel. That's it.
[Toby] Welcome to the Winners Bracket Final where Scythe goes up against Na'Vi.
The winner gets a slot in the Grand Final.
[hyhy] The crowds were all cheering for them.
And their draft was very scary. We were, like, caught off by surprise.
But, we were like, "We've gotta win this, man."
We've gotta show them who's boss.
[Toby] Scythe has managed to take all the best players from Singapore
and put them in their lineup.
One million!
[Toby] Na'Vi, they look cool, calm, and collected.
They know exactly what they gotta do.
It all comes down to gameplay right now.
And I gotta say like, Na'Vi's lineup, it is not unbeatable.
So now they're gonna look for the initiation and possible kill.
hy is gonna get caught.
Now bottom lane. Held in place.
Sven stunned. Sven will go down.
LighTofHeaveN, he helped out, but Ancient Apparition gets the last hit.
[Toby] Na'Vi are dominating this final.
Now Na'Vi, they're gonna take the chance here. They're gonna go in for the GG.
And GG is the call from hy first.
Na'Vi are already off their computers. They're not even sticking around. They've got the GG.
They're not even sticking around. They've got the GG.
Na'Vi are into the Grand Finals and will play for the one million dollars.
Scythe will go down.
They will face the winner of the Loser's Bracket.
[hyhy] We had just lost our confidence match against Na'Vi.
It was actually quite a blow to us.
The game was really the turning point for me
because I actually learned that in life you can only trust in yourself, actually…
not in the sense that you can't trust people,
but, yeah, like I said, the one who will never let you down is yourself.
[Fear] Within the gaming world, I'd like to be, be the first place.
You know, it's like I'm following behind my mother's footsteps, basically.
She worked really hard to get where she is,
and I kind of wanna be the same way. I wanna work hard for whatever I do.
[Fear] For me, I mean, I've never really had a dad.
So if I had any questions about anything,
the person I was most comfortable talking to was my mom.
[Fear] She definitely had the most influence on my life.
When she comes home from work,
she's always, you know, anxious to bring up the subject how she won a big case.
I'm always proud of her when she wins these big cases 'cause I know it means a lot to her.
[Fear] In the back of my head, I'm always, like,
if I do well and if I win this tournament, you know,
I'll finally be able to prove, like, I'm getting something out of this.
[Toby] And whoever wins this match will be facing up against EHOME,
but whoever will lose it, is going to be eliminated already.
Like, EHOME, they're looking really strong right now.
[Fear] We had the stronger late-game heroes, the better team fight.
Just all we had to do was just control the pushes.
[Toby] Now, Online Kingdom, they're split! The stun on Santa! The splash as well.
They're gonna claim a Windrunner. Will they? Yes, they do!
It's 2-0 for Online Kingdom. Moscow 5, not the start they wanted.
But Online Kingdom having an amazing start…
We were so close to winning until some few mistakes that occurred in the late game.
[Toby] They might go right now.
There's four heroes standing right next to each other. The timing is wrong!
[Fear] There's communication problems because we're an international team.
So I think full-nationality teams have an advantage over most teams.
[Toby] Almost there! Big try! Fear's in trouble though.
He's shackled and Lacoste is in. He casts his ulti as well.
[Theeban] And it just fell apart from there.
They just slowly beat us down.
Eventually, they just broke our base and took every single one of our raxes.
[Toby] This is really hurting Online Kingdom.
They've lost three. Enigma pops.
The team is wiped for Online Kingdom.
The base will be taken and Moscow 5 will now play EHOME
The base will be taken and Moscow 5 will now play EHOME and advance in the tournament.
Now, Online Kingdom, they are out. So much promise.
It didn't happen in the end for Fear and the rest of Online Kingdom,
and it will be Moscow 5 that will advance…
[Theeban] I think everybody on the team was very emotional.
I could only imagine how he was feeling.
[Dominik] Some people take it more personally and they give everything to win.
[Theeban] It was very satisfying knowing that we reached that Top 8,
but he had better expectations for our team,
and we'd come a long way and it's all thanks to Fear.
[Dominik] If you don't go as far as you thought you were gonna be,
I guess you end up in tears or something.
[Fear] All of us are really disappointed, but I guess that's just how it goes.
When I get back home, I need to make a big decision in my life.
Like, just the benefits of playing Dota professionally,
how much I can make from it,
and how much time I really need to put into it to be 100 percent, so…
[Fear] The only way I would ever do that is if I move in with my teammates
and have like a training house with them,
so I know for sure that we're all dedicated.
I think things happen for a reason,
and when things happen, you just do your best
and continue going forward with it.
I mean, deep down inside, I know this career is gonna work out for me in the end.
[analyst, in Chinese] As for the Chinese teams, I hope and know that they're capable of coming out of the Losers Bracket.
that they're capable of coming out of the Losers Bracket. The top three teams are likely to be Na'Vi, Scythe, and a Chinese team
which I personally hope will be EHOME.
[woman analyst, in Chinese] Emotionally, I would hope that EHOME would win.
Turning him into a pig! They need to get this kill.
The stun! The Weaver Wave! It's a little piglet!
And it's dead! Slardar! 820, he's almost dead!
And it's dead! Slardar! 820, he's almost dead! Burrow Strike! Epicenter!
Burrow Strike! Epicenter!
357! It's a double-kill by the Weaver!
EHOME, they'll lose FCB as well.
Moscow 5, casualties of war.
Holy Hell!
[Zou, in Chinese] In China, this game is a professional career.
We are stressed because we have to win.
If we don't win or we lose to foreign teams,
If we don't win or we lose to foreign teams, [Zou, in Chinese] Chinese fans will have doubt in us.
[Toby] Now Lion though is gonna find him. Boxes him up.
Finger's already started. There's the stun. Maelk in a lot of trouble. Really caught out of position.
AA ulti will fly in but hits on nothing. Mania with the SK ultimate…
[Tang, in Chinese] The situation is China against the world.
If we win the championship, it is what we are supposed to do.
If we win the championship, it is what we are supposed to do. I tell them, if you are coming here, you are here for the first place.
I will tell them every day, we must accomplish this. We must achieve this.
Our tradition is anything other than the champion trophy we will not bring home.
They will go ahead and trash it at the airport.
[Toby] Now PLT. Support Teleporting in. FCB gets the first stun.
Misery over-commits on the top lane.
-[shouts] -GG!
[Tang, in Chinese] I can feel they really want to beat us, the foreign teams.
PLT, he's had enough of this. FCB! What a time for a Frog!
Misery will pop!
[in Chinese] But when they watch us play, they feel…
that there is no way to beat us.
[hyhy] This is where my dad works.
For as long as I remember,
he's doing the logistics for the company here.
So it involves the shipping of the containers from one place to another.
[hyhy] When I was younger, he used to work, like, 15 to 16 hours a day.
He's pretty much given up on everything else in his life.
He's always made it clear to me that, you know, I should focus on my life, focus on my studies so as to not follow in his footsteps.
focus on my studies so as to not follow in his footsteps.
He doesn't want me to, you know, be slogging as hard as he is right now.
[hyhy] But, you know, the chance to be the best in the world at, at something…
you don't get it much in life.
I heard my son say, uh, he's working at this, what, Dota.
[Lim] He spends a lot of time and he gets nothing. For me, it's very disappointing.
Never goes to school. He wants to play computer.
Then in the morning, sleep.
[Lim] Then computer until the next day morning. Then he sleeps.
The whole day at least 15 hours at the computer a day.
His life, my… [chuckles] …my son's life is like that.
For me, I hope for my son to study more. Not like me. I never studied.
When I was young, I was also the same as Han Yong, always spent a lot of time to play.
[Lim] But now I also regret, why I don't study.
But now I'm hoping my son continues to study
to get an education better than me.
This is my hope.
I want to win this badly.
We'll do whatever we can.
For hy, I feel it was a great choice, a brilliant choice.
Because he was considering that we could have won.
It's an opportunity that you shouldn't miss out.
So, get ready, sign in, log in, play around, test a little bit,
and then join the lobby in about four minutes.
[Daryl] It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
If you miss it, it might be gone forever. You might not experience it again.
[Toby] And we have a rematch. EHOME versus Scythe.
EHOME facing up against the team that forced them into the lower bracket.
[Liu] The psychological pressure is immense, especially upon the drafter.
Because he is the one who is in the end responsible for the team's picks.
-No, no, no, no, no. -No, no. Don't say no!
No, no. Trust me. No.
Wait, wait, wait. Tell me this. You really want it?
I really think…
It's the Antimage and SF. That's what I think.
[Toby] Shadow Fiend? Alrighty then. It's hyhy as SF.
Everyone knows how to counter a Shadow Fiend.
It's a very bold pickup here by Scythe.
The fact, if Scythe wins the early game, they're gonna gain so much momentum,
but if they don't, then EHOME will basically roll themselves into the Grand Final.
hyhy, BKB is gonna wear off pretty soon, Venomancer, great strike!
-[Toby] hy's dead! -Stay in the trees now!
And he wants xy-, he catches up to him. And he brings him down.
[in Chinese] Hey! I told you to stay in the trees!
Why'd you come out?
-Stay in the trees! I told you. -What will I do?
[Toby] What an ulti! He Cogs!
Chawy, he wants to leap, but there is just no Mana!
[in Chinese] I already told you.
-I told you. Do you understand? -It's okay. I'm alive. I'm alive.
[Toby] If he can pop off an ulti like that, he doesn't really have to reveal himself to his opponent.
He can really just initiate. Oh, there he goes!
He can really just initiate. Oh, there he goes! hyhy doesn't manage to pop off an ultimate.
hyhy doesn't manage to pop off an ultimate.
-[Toby] Earthshaker is already dead. -Nice!
[Toby] A2RS really gunning for hyhy.
There are already three gone. Make that four.
It's a double-kill for the Anti-mage. And they're headed for the tower right now.
There is a GG. Good Game called by hyhy.
Scythe have had enough now. EHOME will advance.
The Chinese hopes will stay alive
as they will go up against Na'Vi with a one-game disadvantage…
[hyhy] The first-placing was very important to me.
And to add on to that, my studies were also at the same time affected by everything.
So everything was related.
When everything comes falling down at the same time it's quite hard to handle.
it's quite hard to handle.
[hyhy] Things are all changed.
So you gotta, like, plan your life again. All over again.
I've learned a lot.
You've gotta realize your, your flaws.
That's the toughest part, I feel.
I don't do things as well alone.
So if you try to do everything by yourself,
it's not gonna be possible, you know.
I'm actually a believer of fate, and I told myself
that, um, winning isn't necessary because there are so many more things in life.
How you take care of the people you love.
I think that's, that's a very big thing. You know that's a very important thing.
It's, it's the most important thing ever.
[Dendi] Catch these guys.
It's not fair. Catch these guys. I just woke up. It's not fair.
[Dendi] My haircut… still crazy. No?
But I don't care.
Okay, I have everything with me.
Let's go.
[Toby] We are now at the final day of The International Dota 2 Championships.
It is Na'Vi. They have a one-game advantage.
It is Na'Vi. They have a one-game advantage. Sitting very, very sweetly in the Grand Final.
Sitting very, very sweetly in the Grand Final.
Who will get a shot at the one million dollars?
[Liu] Na'Vi was running the same strategy the whole time
and no one seemed to be able to counter it.
Na'Vi loves pushing from minute 10 and trying to end the game at minute 15.
[Fear] Those strategies are very sensitive because if you fail even once
it can become a very difficult game for you.
EHOME has been known for how well they defend their base So if there was a team that could stop Na'Vi's push it would be EHOME.
So if there was a team that could stop Na'Vi's push it would be EHOME.
[Toby] And let's get this game underway.
The players will start to pick up their heroes
with one million dollars at stake.
Na'Vi will need to win two. EHOME will need to win three.
[Liu] Running a very, very old school strategy with three core heroes.
EHOME managed to survive Na'Vi's onslaught early.
[Toby] It's all on Dendi. PLT TP's himself in.
Dendi on the retreat back out to the tower.
Will he get himself away? X!!. There it is.
Last hit, 357, the Venomancer brings down Dendi in the middle.
[Fear] Every time you see Dendi perform he's always playing very well
and he usually doesn't lose his lanes.
[Clement] So, Dendi, his impatience is that Chinese teams, they are patient.
They look out for the fact that you might cross a line,
and they will take you and kill you and win the game through those situations.
[Toby] Trouble in the mid lane again. There's already the Gush.
[Toby] Trouble in the mid lane again. There's already the Gush. 357, PLT, everyone is right on top of Dendi.
He's in the wrong place.
And the way Na'Vi played, they really gambled basically.
Dendi's really been ganked, just shut down.
And not a single kill to his name as well.
Now Na'Vi gonna assault inside the base.
Watch Artstyle. Tier 3 tower. VS Swap! Artstyle's in the wrong place!
Watch Artstyle. Tier 3 tower. VS Swap! Artstyle's in the wrong place! Doom there as well! BKB's both popping off!
Ravage will pop from LighTofHeaveN unable to affect EHOME.
Pudge will go down. They wanna be initiated on.
Na'Vi, they need to fall back.
[Clement] They take your little upsets
and just win the game through those mistakes.
[Toby] GG from Na'Vi!
EHOME is celebrating right now inside the booth.
Na'Vi cannot believe it!
They've dominated this tournament up till now, and EHOME takes the first match so convincingly.
[Liu] That was the first loss of Na'Vi during the whole tournament.
They went undefeated until the Grand Final.
[Toby] We're gonna have a 15-minute break and be right back here soon.
Na'Vi, they need to compose themselves.
EHOME, well, they just need to be awesome. What a play by them!
[Dendi] Any loss actually makes me pretty sad.
We tried to put family pictures here.
This is our mom and dad.
And I think that this one is our favorite actually.
My childhood, we lived a poor life,
and Dad was working for all our lives.
[Artem] But he helped us every time and every problem.
I just ask him and he'll do everything for me,
for Katya, for Danil as well.
[Artem] But Danil and Father were like friends.
[Irina, in Russian] Indeed my husband was simply a fanatical fisherman.
[Irina, in Russian] Danil was, I would say, his best student.
Danil has the same patience and control as his dad.
He could sit for hours and watch the bobber
that wouldn't even twitch.
[Katya] They could sit with no speaking for hours.
And just enjoy each other's company.
They understood each other without words.
[Dendi] One day I was going fishing, but Dad never showed up.
When I came home it was already super late.
He was feeling bad.
He went to the hospital. He decided to…
stay for a few weeks, you know, so we watch everything, stuff like this.
[Dendi] And, uh… cancer.
It was a very big shock for me because he was very thin.
I cannot understand that this is my father.
[Artem] We were all sure that it must be okay.
But, uh, it was a very short time.
I was really sad and was crying a lot.
I was upset about I couldn't say to him, many times, how much I loved him.
[Irina, Russian] After his dad passed away, he hasn't gone fishing once.
Not even once. For now, this is all in the past.
Actually, I spent more time near the computer because I could not think about it.
because I could not think about it.
It's like a distractor.
It was like a start time, actually.
[Dendi] The push to play more.
And that's maybe one of the reasons why I'm playing now.
Maybe I wouldn't play at all.
[Katya] The relationship of Danil and my mom grew stronger these days.
They support each other and they are very good friends.
I think that this is very important for Danil.
[Dendi] You know, five years ago, I wouldn't care about many things.
Now, I'm thinking about it a lot.
Something knocks you down, you need to learn to get up.
So I'm trying to research this.
To learn to get up.
[Dendi] It's the most important moment in my life
because everything I worked on wasn't useful.
And now I have a chance to win this tournament for my family.
So we have currently EHOME and Na'Vi playing in the Grand Finals.
Na'Vi just lost one game versus EHOME and it's 1-1.
So both teams have to win two matches in order to win the one million dollars.
Because our picks looked completely different, we were like passive and stuff.
People thought, like, we lost the first game, we're gonna lose the second game.
[Clement] We were maybe a little bit demoralized.
We really needed to change to a different pick.
We were missing something.
[Dmitry, in Russian] We picked Enigma just to have a strong team fight a five versus five combat.
just to have a strong team fight a five versus five combat.
It was, like, the last hero left and I never played it before.
[Clement] Then, we're, like, "Dendi, you go!"
And he's, like, "Guys, I've never played it!
But, I can do it!"
[Clement] So we took the risk of taking him and risking maybe playing him badly.
[Toby] So it looks like down on that bottom lane, Dendi will be taking the Enigma.
It is gonna be a very, very rough lane…
Na'Vi lost the game.
And they're playing something now that they're not as confident with.
EHOME figured out Na'Vi. Figured out how to play against it.
And I'm gonna stick to my word and I'm gonna say EHOME will win it.
It was incredibly ballsy from Dendi to do that,
on the verge of winning the million dollars for your team.
[in Chinese] That's very stupid.
[in Chinese] That's very stupid. That's suicidal.
[Toby] Dendi really now caught out.
He's in trouble. Rockets to fly in.
FCB long way in on the tower, lands the stun.
Tinker just lasers him to death. It will cost FCB his life.
[Clement] Then we made some little mistakes.
We played a really semi-type of, like, "turtle" strategy.
Really passive. Really passive. We don't play like that.
[Toby] Puppey and Dendi just wanna retreat back out. 820! What a Fissure!
PLT is there! Echo Slam as well!
Beautiful play there by EHOME.
But I know if I die, I die not for nothing.
[Toby] X!! in the middle lane…
Force, Rocket, Laser. It's enough!
Dendi goes down in the middle lane. Again, EHOME controls…
Sometimes, it can be like, you dying, but your teammates picking up more.
[Toby] EHOME, they still wanna push out that mid…
[Clement] They weren't ready for Dendi Enigma.
It was a patient Enigma.
That was the most patient Enigma in the world.
[Toby] Dendi as well. Gonna look for the Hole.
Black Hole!
Three are gonna go down for EHOME.
Currently, Na'Vi, they, they have the advantage now.
[Clement] That really impresses me how he's able to make that transition.
You just have to have the balls, basically.
He was scared of losing. That's why he's so patient and he did everything right.
[Fear] Their strategy is kind of similar to how EHOME won.
[Liu] Na'Vi defeated them "Late Game."
And I think this really shattered EHOME's confidence.
[Toby] And "GG" is the call from EHOME. Na'Vi, they take the game.
And they are only one win short of taking home one million dollars.
But the question really is…
[Liu] We hardly won the second game.
Chinese teams generally are feared for their "Late Game" potential.
[Toby] So we hit the point now. The gloves come off.
EHOME, they will master their knowledge, their experience, their calls up against Na'Vi.
their calls up against Na'Vi.
And Puck will be the last hero for Na'Vi. The nimble hero there already.
Once again a lot of aggressive heroes for them.
Na'Vi LighTofHeaveN playing as the Beastmaster again
with Dendi playing as the Puck this time.
If Na'Vi wins this, they win the whole tournament.
This Clash of the Titans right here is something we will not wanna miss.
This Clash of the Titans right here is something we will not wanna miss. X!! will come in closer. They will be able to get that kill.
X!! will come in closer. They will be able to get that kill. Doom now on Dendi. Pulled in by X!!
Doom now on Dendi. Pulled in by X!!
Doom now on Dendi. Pulled in by X!! The entire EHOME team turns on him.
Lich will go down.
FCB is on the run. XBOCT after the chase of him.
Might be enough. Needs some more damage. Storm! X!! Long jump in.
Dendi Orbing up to the high ground. FCB! Puts on the Rift.
Will he be able to get the kill? He's on the retreat. Yes, it is. Dendi with the last right click.
EHOME now, they're gonna rotate themselves down.
Na'Vi already in the pit.
They're trying to bring down Roshan, all 5.
Dendi! He's gonna jump out! He goes for the Dream Coil! He gets them!
He gets EHOME! Holds them in the middle lane.
Na'Vi already on their way out of the pit.
They're coming in to help out Dendi.
[Clement] Then we just went in and demolished them.
[Toby] Now they're on top of the Tier 3 tower.
They're gonna bring it down. Yes, it does! It goes down!
EHOME, they're trying desperately to defend,
but Na'Vi, the onslaught will continue.
The mid tower's already being pushed. The Tier 4 tower is gonna go down.
And running in right now is the rest of Na'Vi.
They are running forward to one million dollars.
And they will get it! The "GG" is the call from EHOME.
Na'Vi have just won one million dollars.
EHOME do take home 250,000 dollars in second place.
But Na'Vi are the champions!
There's moments of E-Sports that are landmark,
and this is one of them, in Cologne.
And Na'Vi, the winners. You guys have just made history.
[crowd chanting] Na'Vi! Na'Vi!
[Katya] I was jumping on the sofa.
And screaming like a crazy girl,
because I was the happiest girl in the world.
And my brother just won one million dollars!
[crowd chanting] Na'Vi! Na'Vi!
I think in ten years' time
all the gamers which we currently have showing themselves,
they're gonna be the guys we'll look back at and say, "This was the beginning, this is where it all started."
and say, "This was the beginning, this is where it all started."
These are the guys that worked hard and they took the risk.
They proved themselves.
And they forwarded the entire industry to the point where we could have a kick-start.
We could show the world what we do.
And then who knows how big we could get at that point.
We've come far already.
When more and more people support it and it becomes more and more normal,
it's going to go from a niche to becoming accepted in societies.
I think in 15 years, E-Sports will be bigger than football.
Than basketball, than everything.
That kid who you thought played too many video games
is potentially going to be on a path
where he's earning 250,000 a year, salary.
He's flying the world. He's gonna be endorsed.
Gaming's the biggest entertainment industry in the world.
So if you're a star,
you are potentially one of the biggest stars in the world.
So, if that, like everything else with computers grows exponentially
or whatever, then 5 or 10 years could be a big step actually.
[Tammy] Changing mindsets is never easy. So it's gonna take a while.
When the gamers now become parents,
we will be supportive of our kids playing,
and I think that's really when everything will boom.
[newscaster] After weeks of training,
a local man has led his online gaming team to the top,
placing seventh in an international gaming competition held in Germany.
Yeah, she's definitely proud of me. I mean, just, she had her camera out,
like, "Why are taking a photo of the television?"
[Fear] I know she's really smart. She's a lawyer, so…
But in the end, I think she'll be more understanding
and be willing to support me more, so it worked out.
[hyhy] We were disappointed with our loss.
And, yeah, it's a mixture of both, we're happy and sad that we got third.
Because of the emotions, I felt like she's the one I wanted to share them with.
And it got pretty clear only then that I had to get her back.
After the tournament, I actually went back to look for her,
and talk things out, and we have actually begun dating again.
And things are actually going great.
I love her, you know. [chuckles]
[hyhy] She played a huge role, a very huge part
in… in the me today.
[Dendi] One week ago, it was 3,000 followers. I was happy.
Then it's boomed. 8,000 followers.
It's not about the number.
Even if it's one or two, I'm fine.
So… you don't need to show numbers actually. I think.
[Katya] My father, I think,
didn't have time to understand what Dendi's doing.
We lost him too early.
decided to release the prisoners during the pandemic.
But the government reasons
that this policy is made on the basis of humanity
in order to prevent the spreading of the Covid-19 virus
in order to prevent the spreading of the Covid-19 virus -in prisons. -Hey. What’s wrong with you?
Icuk!
Icuk!
Where are you now?
Icuk is dead…
Verily we belong to Allah, and verily to Him do we return.
I’m so sorry.
Was he shot by the police?
No.
-We’re safe. -So?
We were on the way, but suddenly he had a severe coughing fit.
-Oh, no. -Shortness of breath…
Seriously, bro? Ouch, careful. It may be contagious!
You think I don't watch any news on TV?
So, what now?
What should I do now?
Just throw him away. Just throw him away, there.
Where are you now?
-What? -If no one’s there, dump his body and run.
-Do you think Icuk is an animal? -No, I don't mean it that way!
-Asshole! -Listen…
Shit!
Bro, don't leave me!

Icuk! Here, I'm giving you what you want!
Cuk, come out!
I've got what you want!
This is what you want, right?
Hey! Icuk!
Cuk…
I'm sure this is what you want, right?
Calm down over there, Cuk.
Promise me you will not scare me off.
I brought it for you.
Rest in peace, Cuk.
Why is my share so little, bro?
Shit!
How did it go, bro?
You're asking me how did it go?
Next time…
Every time we do something,
whatever it is, do the swab test!

But, today, we made an improvement.
The whole process took only 12 minutes.
In a real emergency, in a real fire, in a real war,

I learnt this song in our rural hideout.
This song was used especially to
motivate soldiers and their spirits.
How did you know Mum?
I knew her when we were young.
We were from the same village.
Later, she came to Southeast Asia, I remained in China.
We finally came together
when the Japanese invaded.
She joined the Communists to fight the Japanese.
So, I came to fight the Japanese, too.
Only in our rural hideout, did we become close.
She taught soldiers to sing and dance.
She performed plays about defeating the Japanese.
Can she remember?
She has forgotten.
Sometimes when I sing, she sings along.
She can't sing on her own.
She could sing many songs.
She had a very good voice.
She has forgotten many things with her dementia.
Everything is forgotten.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Mom
Happy birthday to you
Now, you have to blow it.
Mom, you have to make a wish.
Make a wish before you blow out the last two.
Make a wish to yourself.
I wish I'll be free from aches and pains.
Wait. Now, blow out those two.
-Okay. -Yup.
I have always felt myself a Singaporean, even though I live in New York.
I am both a New Yorker and Singaporean in equal parts.
I first performed "4'33"" in Singapore at the Arts Festival.
I think this was back in 1991.
There was a gentleman who was so indignant and insulted by this experience
of having to sit in the concert hall with nothing happening,
that he left the auditorium and slammed the door behind him,
which was absolutely perfect.
And then, a decade later, I performed "4'33"" again in Singapore,
and I was so welcomed back this time.
Whereas the first time the critic, you know, really lambasted me.
So, it was a real homecoming.
They were literally lining up to have CDs purchased and autographed.
And we did this for close to an hour, and we sold about 50 CDs,
and I signed them all personally.
I recently had the great privilege of performing a 75th birthday tribute
to George Crumb at Carnegie Hall this past November.
I felt very, very privileged that the New York Times'
Weekend Arts section gave me the cover slot…
…as a teaser for the article inside, which…
I got a rave review in the New York Times.
How does it feel now, to be welcomed?
It warms the cockles of my ageing heart.

All right. Here is Charlee!
Everybody say, "Hello, Charlee."
Hello, Charlee!
-Can you hear that? -Cannot.
You know, Charlee, you've been around for 50 years,
performing first with my dad, and then, with me.
-Correct. Long time. -I know.
Tell me, through the years, how have the kids changed over 50 years?
-You know something? -What?
-Fifty years, lots of things have changed. -Correct.
But, you know, children, over 50 years, they have not changed.
-You can speak 36 languages? -Yeah.
-Can I test you now? -Why?
-Show everybody how clever you are. -All right.
How to you say "thank you" in Chinese?
Thank you.
How to say "How are you" in Chinese?
You how are.
-I teach you some nice Malay words. -Okay.
-You follow me. -Okay.
Tonight.
Tonight.
I meet many friends.
I meet many animals.

You concentrate on your ball, okay? Straight.

We just liked the song, that's all.
In those days, when we sang, we just enjoyed the song.
It reminds us of the days when--
Actually, for myself, we didn't quite know the meaning.
The implications and meaning.
But we just like the rhythm.
Had only our music teacher still been alive,
he would join us now.
I could invite him to come here.
I left school 50 years ago.
Fifty years ago.
Today is my 50th anniversary.

The time frame of four minutes and 33 seconds,
is purely an artificial parameter.
So, in that period of time, we can concentrate
and listen to the music of the environment,
which is constantly ongoing.
It never ceases and it's continually varied.
We never listen to the environment.
We are too busy listening to the thoughts in our head.
Doors closing.
Next stop, Tanjong Pagar.
Outram Park interchange.
Potong Pasir is "Potong Pasir." Right?
Bedok I would say "Bedok."
I don't think anybody else would say it differently.
Clementi is "Clementi."
Yeah. How would you say it in Singlish?
-Clementi. -Clementi.
Really?
Lavender, I don't go with the Singlish way of saying "Lavender."
It's "Lavender."
I did attend Raffles Girls' School,
and we had a principal at that time there,
and she was a stickler for us speaking perfect English.
There's no way that you could go wrong with that kind of training.
The station Queenstown seems a bit muffled.
And I keep telling myself, "That's something I got to re-do."
I mean, I want to be recognized by the industry,
but not by the passengers,
the everyday passenger. No. There's no need to.
It's good for them to know there's a voice that comes on air
and tells them, gives them instructions and all that.
Your attention, please.
Eating or drinking is not allowed in the stations and trains.
Thank you for keeping the stations and trains clean
for the comfort of all passengers.
Wait here, I'll call you. When bus comes, I'll call you.
This is not my bus. My bus is behind.

95.8 FM, Singapore's favorite news station.
When I was seven or eight, my father bought us a harmonica.
At that time, it was a toy, not an instrument.
When I was 12, I realized…
…it could be a legitimate musical instrument.
In 1972, I went to perform in many schools.
There was very warm response from some schools.
In Dunman High School,
I once performed during their school assembly.
Immediately after,
500 students signed up for my classes.
Now, I am not a recorder player at all.
I've never really liked the instrument myself.
But it became, I think, the instrument of choice because
the people in the extracurricular,
now called co-curricular department of the Ministry of Education, felt
that every child has two hands,
and therefore, they can use their fingers and blow.
And by movement of fingers they could get these notes.
Even I would have difficulty hitting the right notes
because the air pressure has to be equal to the sound.
Low notes, you blow slower, you know,
and something like that.
And to ask children to play with this, they always will hit, for the low C…
Mind you, the low C, the hardest note.
The moment you do a bit too much, you get…
You get the high octave.
And worse still, if you blow too much…
The harmonica has a fixed pitch.
Many learners, I mean the common learners,
can't tell the difference in pitch.
The harmonica, like the piano, has a fixed pitch.
I do know children,
and if you spoke to them, they will tell you this,
exactly what I am saying.
That they didn't really enjoy playing this instrument,
but they had to, It was part of their music class,
and they did their best with it.
I have promoted
and taught the harmonica in many schools.
But not once did anyone from the Ministry of Education approach me
to promote the harmonica in schools.
Our leaders were probably
people who had their music education either in Europe or in England.
You see?
There were some who went to France, there were some who went to UK.
And if you had gone to either France or UK,
this was probably used in schools.
And so, they copied the idea from the British.
I would think so, you see?
Whereas we should have taken the idea from China.
I am now teaching only one school, Raffles Junior College.
Long, long, long ago, harmonicas were imported in Singapore.
And they could have been considered for use.
Unfortunately…
Whatever will be, will be.
I chose "Chooks" because it's my 21st century tribute
to the noodle seller of my childhood.
And you see why, right?
Remember when the boy used to come ahead?
The little assistant would come ahead of the noodle seller and he's have his…
There was also the scrap dealer,
and there was also this wonderful scissor grinder who would come around.
And I still remember his cry which was something like…
And he would sing it in a very rhythmic way.
And all this is something that I think children today,
have absolutely no experience of.

A few years ago…
during Christmas time at Centrepoint,
I was performing there.
After my performance,
some people were jealous.
They called the police from Tanglin Police Station.
When they came, I was performing.
They wanted to arrest me.
They pushed me to the floor, twisted my arm to handcuff me,
even though I am a national treasure and a human being.
Just to carry out their duties.

I have actually lost count
of the number of shows we've performed together.
I have not.
-You have not? -Not.
How many shows have we performed together?
Thirty-two thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight.
No. Just kidding.
All right.
After 50 years performing,
what would you like to say to all Singaporeans?
All right.
I've been around for 50 years.
Even older than Singapore.
All of you know me.
In fact, I am to Singaporeans, what Mickey Mouse is to Americans.
So, why is it that after 50 years of being a true Singaporean,
I have never received my National Day Service award? Why?
Let's give Charlee a big hand!

Wasted days and wasted nights
I have left for you behind
For you don't belong to me
Your heart belongs
To someone else
Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true?
And why should I call your name
When you're to blame
For making me blue?
Don't you remember the day
When you went away
And left me?
I was so lonely
Cried for you only
My love
Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true?
And why should I call your name
When you're to blame
For making me blue?
How's that?
And those that will never forget.
The 26th of December, 2004
may be a distant memory for most of us.
But for thousands of others,
that date is etched in their minds forever.
Every year they recall the extraordinary impact
the Boxing Day tsunami had on their lives
and the lives of so many others.
I couldn’t escape.
The wave hit the left side of my car.
As I walked, I heard a sound like an explosion. Boom! Boom!
It's terrible, and it's like a war zone.
The water sucked me in just like a toilet flush
inside the bungalow.
All I can remember is that people were running
and that the wave was as high as a coconut tree.
This year is the tenth anniversary of the devastating tragedy
which took the lives of almost 230,000 people
from more than a dozen countries.
Five people from four places that were hit by the tsunami
in three countries
share their memories of what it was like for them on that fateful day,
when their lives were changed forever
in just two hours on one fateful day.
Aceh is the most northern province on the island of Sumatra.
The western coastal areas were among the hardest hit by the tsunami.
Before the disaster, Lampu’uk beach was a favorite destination for tourists.
But it was hit hard by the waves and afterwards it lay in ruins.
There was only one building near the beach that was not destroyed.
Rahmatullah Mosque.
In the corner of the mosque,
there are some pillars which were damaged by the tsunami,
but the mosque committee decided not to repair them
in order that future generations will remember the disaster.
At 7:58 a.m. on Sunday the 26th of December, 2004,
a massive earthquake measuring nine on the Richter scale
struck the west coast of Northern Sumatra.
The energy released on the Earth's surface was equivalent to the explosion
of 23,000 Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs.
In Banda Aceh, the people that lived there rushed from their homes
straight after the first ripples of the earthquake.
Local cameraman Rizki Aulia will never forget.
I never ever expected a tsunami could happen in Aceh.
I never expected it.
At the time, I was standing near a coconut tree.
The force of the tremors made the coconuts fall from the tree.
Then I saw several houses
being instantly destroyed by the earthquake.
That was the beginning.
In 2004, Rizki lived in Banda Aceh
with his wife, Elly, and a young daughter, Syifa Nabila.
Apart from being a mother and housewife,
Elly also ran a small shop underneath their house,
and worked part time as a makeup artist.
Before the tsunami came,
I spoke with my mother-in-law.
I told her I had a bad feeling,
so she suggested I take a shower.
Then my mother-in-law screamed,
"Elly! Get out of the shower! It’s an earthquake."
I couldn’t stand upright anymore and I started throwing up.
I was thinking what has happened to my wife and child.
The tremors were so strong that there was no way you could run or walk.
You couldn’t even stand up.
When the tremors stopped, I rushed home to check on my wife and child.
And thank God, they were safe.
Below the Indian Ocean, a massive piece of the Earth's crust suddenly shifted…
and raised the sea floor dramatically.
and raised the sea floor dramatically. The violent movement displaced billions of tons of water above it
The violent movement displaced billions of tons of water above it
and sent powerful shockwaves in every direction.
The devastating tsunami waves
then traveled rapidly across the ocean towards land,
reaching speeds of over 800 kilometers per hour.
As the tsunami got closer to land,
it grew into monster ten-meter high waves.
The force was irresistible.
Suddenly, about 15 minutes after the tremors,
a young man on a motorbike
went past my house and shouted,
"Run, run, the seawater is as high as the coconut tree."
I then realized that Banda Aceh must have collapsed
and was now being submerged under water.
So, I grabbed my daughter and my mother-in-law,
who urged me to get into the backseat of the car with them.
But there was nowhere to sit, as it was already full.
Then someone said, "Don’t just stand there, run!"
I ran towards the end of our street but the wave was closing in fast.
I screamed "Don’t get into the car".
But the warning came too late,
and while Elly was swept away by the wave,
her daughter, her mother, and Rizki's parents were all trapped in the car.
The car that had been in front of my house got swept away
and got stuck on the balcony.
There were three layers of cars.
There was one car, then another, and my car was on top.
I tried to help the family who were inside the car
but they were all stuck and I couldn’t save them.
I was confused.
I thought "Dear, Allah, what’s happened to my family?
Will I be alone in this world?
Will they survive? Is it the end of the world?"
Then I crashed into the roof of the house, so I screamed for help.
I didn’t have any choice but to run back inside the house
and get up here to the second floor.
I managed to get here but my wife didn’t.
The tsunami swept her away to the back of our house,
while the car was still stuck down there.
Somehow she managed to reach the roof.
We then heard someone screaming for help,
and God knows where the strength came from,
but we managed to tear the roof off
and were able to save my wife and another girl, too.
Banda Aceh was totally devastated by the tsunami.
The huge wall of water was so powerful
that it picked up ships and left them several miles inland.
Meanwhile, in Phuket,
it was a lovely sunny morning
and the beach was full of people enjoying the good weather,
totally unaware of the impending disaster heading their way.
Phuket is one of Thailand's most popular holiday destinations,
and with its many temples,
visitor attractions,
and sandy beaches,
tourists enjoy coming here all year round.
But Christmas is the peak season,
so there were many people on Patong Beach on Boxing Day morning in 2004.
Local bar manager, Apple, was one of them.
She was having breakfast with eight of her friends
who she'd been working with all night.
We walked down to the beach and sat together near the sea.
We drank and walked around and talked. You know how girls talk.
Noisy, more than birds, more than chicken.
It was Apple's turn to go and get the girls some drinks.
As Apple walked to the mini mart, she heard a strange sound.
As I walked, I heard a sound like an explosion. Boom! Boom!
Patong often has a problem with its electricity outage,
so we are used to hearing explosions.
Sometimes it’s only one boom, but sometimes it happens many times,
and it also causes a lot of smoke after explosion.
Just after I heard the explosion the phone box suddenly fall down.
As it fell, it hit me here.
I felt terrible pain, and then I became unconscious.
Despite a lag of up to several hours
between the earthquake and the impact of the tsunami,
nearly all of the victims in Phuket were taken completely by surprise.
Much of Thailand's coastline was decimated that morning,
but Khao Lak was hit the worst.
Franky Gun remembers it all too well.
In 2004, he was working in real estate
and just got a brand new office on the main road.
His wife, Lak was pregnant,
and everything in his life was looking good for him.
Before I moved to Khao Lak,
I actually did a check on the Internet for the safest places in the world,
according to natural disasters and stuff.
Violence, political unrest and stuff.
The west coast of Thailand actually came out very, very good.
So I thought, okay, I'm fine over there,
so it's a very, very good area to stay, the west coast of Thailand.
On Boxing Day morning, Lak went to Phuket
but Franky stayed in bed, as it was his day off.
I woke up because of the earthquake.
So it was… We had two tremors.
The first one woke me up,
and then shortly after, the second one came.
So I looked through the window and I just saw these people running.
They had bikinis, um, swimsuits on and everybody was running.
And a lot of noise outside, and I thought, what's going on?
Then my mother said to me, "Franky, the water is coming."
I said, what water?
They were a very close family,
and Franky hugged his mother, Ursula,
and his father, Franz, that morning, as he always did, twice a day, every day.
It would be their last embrace.
It is kind of a horror movie, or something like that,
where everything slows down,
you're kind of frozen in that situation
because you have no idea what is going on.
And that was…
perhaps the lifesaver because if we would have made it
outside at that moment, we might as well be…
I might be dead as well.
As a tsunami is a series of waves,
the first wave may not be the most dangerous.
We have been inside the house when the first wave hit
and then the water rose again
up to about one meter 50 high, or something like that.
And then the entrance door glass burst.
All the water was coming inside very quickly,
and the water level was rising and it didn't stop.
I was screaming at my parents, "We have to get out of here,
We have to get out of here now."
And I tried to open the kitchen door,
and I couldn't open it because it was stuck.
All of a sudden I was outside of the house.
The water level was maybe two meters by then.
Then the last thing that I did was shouting in towards the house,
"Mom, Dad, you have to get out of there. The water is rising."
And then the next wave came.
The water pushed me towards the nearby bungalow
and I thought, wow, this is good.
You can grab the roof and climb onto the roof and you're going to be safe.
And in the very instant I touched the roof,
the doors and the windows of this bungalow broke
and the water sucked me in
just like a toilet flush inside the bungalow.
Then I was underwater
with all the furniture and everything that was inside the house, I guess.
And was just bobbing around like a ping pong ball
in this little bungalow.
Trapped underwater.
And it was pitch black.
And it must have been for at least two minutes.
I came to the point where I couldn't hold my breath anymore.
And I thought that I going to die.
In Aceh, Rizki was still stuck on top of his roof
while his daughter, his parents, and his mother-in-law
were trapped in the car.
And then the next wave came.
I tried to rescue anyone who was still alive.
Those of us who still had strength,
tried to save anyone that was near the rooftop of our house.
My wife had been dragged by the tsunami into the house.
She can’t swim, but somehow, she managed to reach the roof.
So, she stayed on the roof and I went back down to the second floor
to try to help the others inside the car.
I dived under the water and found my mother, but she had already died.
I went down deeper and managed to grab a little child’s hand.
I brought him up to the second floor.
His face was covered by mud, so I cleaned it.
He turned out to be my wife’s youngest brother.
I pumped his chest,
trying to give him resuscitation, but got no reaction,
so I left him and went back in the water again.
This time I grabbed a little child and when I took her out,
she was covered with mud.
I cleaned her face and discovered that it was my own daughter.
She was only two years, eight months and six days old.
Apart from their only daughter,
Elly's mother, and both of Rizki's parents also drowned that day.
We were a very loving family. We never got angry at each other.
We loved all the children.
After the third wave receded back to the ocean,
we realized that it must be a tsunami.
We didn’t dare to get off the roof.
We were thirsty and hungry
but at that moment we thought
those who have survived must keep on living.
While we were on the roof, my wife told me that we have nothing left.
We have nothing.
But I said no, we still have God.
In Khao Lak, Franky was still fighting for his life.
I was just thinking at that moment, I don't want to die.
Please, please, I don't want to die.
And then it snapped again, and I was on the surface.
In that bungalow, looking at the roof,
the ceiling was gone.
And I could see light shining through from outside
and I got pushed underwater again.
All of a sudden I was outside,
and had this mattress right in front of me.
So I grabbed the mattress and I was just shaking
like a cat in ice water or something like that.
So I didn't have really, any power to swim.
If the mattress wouldn't have been there, I would have drowned for sure.
A few 100 meters further on my journey, I met the wife of a friend of mine.
And she just popped out. I don't know where she was coming from.
All of a sudden she was there.
And I pulled her to the mattress and let her hold onto the mattress, too.
And she asked me, "Franky, what happened?"
I said, "There was an earthquake in the morning,
so this must be some kind of tidal wave or something."
And then, without talking at all, we just floated on,
and I said, "There's a tree."
So we let go of the mattress, climbed up on a tree.
But then sitting on the tree, I realized there was a dead guy
hanging in the tree right next to me so I could have touched him.
It was nightmarish.
The tsunami's path of destruction
continued traveling across the Indian Ocean
towards Sri Lanka.
Get inside. Come on, guys.
Within hours of the earthquake, the tsunami slammed into Sri Lanka.
On the west coast, a passenger train on its way to Galle
was lifted into the air by the waves,
killing over 1,500 people onboard.
The coastal lifestyle of people living in Sri Lanka
contributed to the high number of dead and the many homes that were destroyed.
Batticaloa is on an island surrounded by a lagoon
on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka.
There was no indication that a disaster was about to occur
on Boxing Day morning in 2004.
The sky was clear,
and the wind was coming from the land,
so it was an ideal day for close-to-shore fishing.
Then suddenly, the tsunami ripped into the coast without warning.
Sakthivell Thangavel remembers the day vividly.
At the time, he was working with USA International Development,
and received a call that his twin sister had been killed
while attending a temple ceremony in Batticaloa.
Mahasakthi is…
Yeah, she's my sister.
And Maha means 'big' and Sakthi is energy in our language.
My sister was a chemistry teacher.
She was teaching in a school,
and even though she's a science teacher, she believed in spiritual activities.
On that day, as it's a full moon day,
she was living in the middle of the Batticaloa district,
like three kilometers away from the sea.
So if she lived there, she would have
really kind of escaped like, people like us.
She came for a spiritual activity, spiritual event,
and after finishing that, she went with her son
to a nearby building which is situated in the same temple,
and her husband went to buy something for the temple.
This is the time when the tsunami came,
according to the people who saw this incident there.
Within that time period, somebody have, from that Kallady area,
have informed that there are some bodies closer to this temple and said
most of them who went to temple were died.
And from that end only, our relatives have started to search for her.
One of my brothers who was directly involved
in the searching activity called me,
called my wife and told that,
we're thinking my sister is lost.
Immediately after that, we try to arrange a van to come here.
As I told you, my wife was pregnant, so we couldn't do that
and we couldn't find any van on that day.
It was sudden kind of an activity
to those areas, like the district which I belongs to.
So I used all my network to get a van in the early morning next day.
We travelled together and when we arrived here,
the first shocking news I got was my sister's body was buried
and her son's body was buried because they couldn't keep it the way…
The body was fresh, but because of the water and other things
they couldn't keep it, so that was the first disappointment.
This is the place where my sister lost her life.
The big wave came from there,
and she saw that and suddenly she climbed into the building with her son
and then the wave washed her.
And when we came as a team to search,
I searched outside and my brothers,
and other searched here and they found my sister here.
Because of her long hair, it was stucked with the tree.
And that is why we were lucky enough to get her
and her son's bodies here without any damage.
While the tsunami continued on its western course,
in Phuket, the waves had finally stopped coming
and ambulances were now taking survivors to hospital.
Apple was among them.
When she was found, she was still unconscious,
had a palm frond piercing her stomach, and had lost all her hair.
When I woke up, I didn’t know where I was.
I didn’t have any hair, and I couldn’t feel my legs.
I have to remember, "Where are my mom and my brother?
I want to see my mother, my brother and sister."
I cried but nobody cared. Everyone have problem the same.
I wanted to find my mother and brother.
Then I wanted to know if any of my friends had survived.
But unfortunately, all her friends on the beach that morning had died.
During my recovery, I just lay down on the bed and slept all the time.
Woke up each time, I found no one, none of my family or friends,
so I just slept.
Apple lost her memory,
and couldn't give her name to the hospital staff.
As her family hadn't heard from her, they thought she was dead.
Apple stayed in hospital for the next few months
until eventually her memory came back.
On March 28th,
I phoned home.
My brother answered the phone.
"Apple, where are you?"
I told my mother I was in the hospital.
"Where? Phuket."
My mother came to the hospital to see me. She cried and my brother also cried.
They couldn’t recognize me because I didn’t have any hair
and my skin was so pale that I looked like a ghost.
The next morning, we went home.
In Khao Lak, rescue workers
started the almost impossible task of finding all the missing persons
and letting their families know if their loved ones were alive or dead.
I got the distinct feeling
that my parents were not alive anymore at that moment.
After the near-death experience in the bungalow,
I kind of knew.
I don't know why, but I just had,
I was 100% sure that they were not alive anymore.
I was searching for my parents of course, afterwards.
But honestly, I wished that I wouldn't find them
because I didn't know if I could deal with it,
to see my parents dead, in a puddle of water.
We went to talk to the DVI team
in Takua Pa a couple of times.
And I talked to a guy, his name was Frank as well.
And he was very, very helpful.
He told me what I can bring to make it easier to identify my parents.
So he told me about getting in contact,
getting in touch with the dentist of my parents,
tried to find photos of distinct marks.
I was in Germany at the time,
to clear out the flat of my parents,
which was to me, even, not worse than the tsunami,
but it was close.
Because dealing with all these memories,
and I've been living there from age six until age 19.
When we were finished with this,
two days after,
we got a phone call at my uncle's house, where I was staying at the time.
And there was a guy from the BKA,
Bundeskriminalamt, German Police.
And he told him that my dad has been identified.
And he asked them, what about my mom and they said,
no match so far.
I hoped for my mom to be identified as well,
and that happened the very next day.
So, I made plans then for my return.
We took the ashes of my parents back home,
into the flat where we were living at that time in Phuket,
and had them there for seven days,
which is kind of thing that you have to do before you do burial at sea.
So we had a bouquet of flowers, wedding picture of my parents,
and a couple of flowers,
and things to put in the sea.
And we did a little ceremony
with all the things that my parents loved
to eat and drink here in Thailand.
It was very sad, but it was also, a kind of relief because
we got closure at that point.
So we knew that, okay, now we've done everything,
you know, as perfect as we could, given the circumstances.
In Sri Lanka, Sakthivell was devastated
by the loss of his twin sister who had been extremely close to.
The waves came from this sea, it’s up to that scale,
beyond the tree level,
and the wave went into this side.
And when we came here to search for my sister and others,
the area was full of bodies,
and that area were covered with babies and other bodies,
as well as many vehicles were also washed there.
It's really hard for us to identify which body belongs to whom,
and especially when I was searching for my family,
it's difficult for me to identify
because lots of bodies, and looks like the same.
When I came here, I saw bodies in all these trees.
I was searching for my sister and others, turning the bodies the other side
and looking at the damaged faces.
And I walked around and I saw
children's bodies as well as women and everyone.
And one woman, I still can remember,
had her body like this, trying her best not to allow the water go in
but still she was died and she was like…
It shaked me.
It's terrible, and it's like a war zone.
As the news spread across the world,
the magnitude of the disaster became clear.
And soon assistance, support and sympathy
came for the people affected by the disaster.
The international response was unprecedented,
with over $20 million in aid being pledged.
The final death toll of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami was 226,000.
Ten years after the tsunami,
new roads and houses have been built in Aceh
and there has been an end to the long-running conflict
between Acehnese separatists and the Indonesian military.
There was conflict in Aceh even before I was born.
My grandparents and my parents experienced it.
After the fight for independence,
there was conflict in Aceh until the tsunami on December 26th, 2004.
After the tsunami happened, the conflict stopped completely.
On August 15th, 2005, a peace treaty was signed
and now there is peace in Aceh.
That was a blessing resulting from the tsunami.
The good thing of tsunami.
Rizki has just one regret,
he wasn't able to bury his family.
In my religion, in Islam, the bodies should be buried properly.
I tried to get the bodies so that they could be buried…
for four days.
Four days full,
I tried to save my parents,
my brother, my child’s dead body,
for bury them, but what?
On the fourth day, they all got burned along with other dead bodies.
Although Rizki and Elly was shattered by the death of their only daughter,
they now have three more children.
I’ve had to rebuild my life and think positively.
Why? Because I'm still alive.
So I worked hard and gave it my all and rebuilt my home.
And now I have three children.
Nine, four, and three years old.
I’ve taken them to the ocean
because we live so close to it.
I have told them
about our experience
so that they don’t have to go through
what we went through.
They will already understand.
Unlike us, who didn't know about the tsunami and suffered,
I hope my children and my grandchildren, the future generation,
have better understanding and don’t become victims.
Aceh is transforming now,
and I see it becoming better than it before
probably because many new people are coming to live in Aceh
and that has improved the social life.
Before there were only Acehnese living here,
so anything that was new was not really accepted,
but now that other people are living here, too, the conditions are much better,
and if we want to do something to improve our lives we think, why not?
Elly is now very optimistic about the future for their children.
As far as I can tell, they are growing up very well,
and are not doing anything bad like hitting other children, thank God!
Sometimes I ask my children what they want to be when they grow up.
My son said, "I want to be a cameraman like Dad."
My oldest daughter wants to be a doctor, and the little one wants to be a teacher.
They already have dreams and that makes me very proud
even though we don’t have my parents now, we have my children.
The people who died in the Tsunami Aceh will never be forgotten.
The museum has honored the victims and survivors
by creating a diorama
that shows people frantically trying to flee from the waves.
Another memorial to the disaster
is the huge PLTD Apung 1 power-generating barge
which was swept 500 meters inland
and deposited right in the middle of a residential area.
Phuket has recovered well,
and is once again a tropical playground
where the tourists can enjoy the beaches,
the temples, the food, and the nightlife.
Apple has recently got married
and begun a new life with her husband, Jon.
They live in Malaysia, but often come to Phuket and always visit
the hospital that looked after her.
I feel like I've gotten a new life.
None of my friends were as lucky as me.
My friends lucky as me, not. Just only me.
So I'm thinking like I think before, but made me stronger.
I tell myself to cheer up,
to keep fighting and be healthy.
In Thailand, they have a foundation
that not only helps the victims of the tsunami,
but also helps grieving families of people who have died there
and need help getting their loved ones' remains back to their own countries.
I like to donate and help the people who have passed away
but who have no relatives here. I like to do this very much.
After the tsunami, I am doing it more often.
Apple will never forget the friends she lost on Boxing Day 2004.
When I hear people talking about the tsunami,
I think of my friends and I still miss them.
I think of their families and how they must feel sad, too.
Feel sad it's only me lucky.
Khao Lak is on its way to becoming
one of Thailand's fastest-growing tourist destinations again.
Although the tsunami damaged or destroyed many of the hotels in the area,
they have been rebuilt,
and there is now a variety of accommodation to choose from,
including Franky's small family resort.
Khao Lak has changed
not really a lot compared to how it was before the tsunami.
I would say that the mindset of people has changed.
Of course, it has grown.
We have more hotel beds than we had before the tsunami.
The landscape of Khao Lak also changed a little
but not really much.
You get a different feeling when you come to Khao Lak,
it feels like home, feels like family.
And this has grown stronger over the years, I would say.
Today, there is little sign of the destruction
caused by the tsunami in Khao Lak.
Except for the site of a police boat washed a kilometer inland
that now forms part of a memorial site.
Yeah, this is one of the two police boats
that have been sent to the coastline here
to protect the grandson of the King's family.
And the boat got washed in all the way from the beach
which is about 1.6 kilometers, about one nautical mile.
We are here about, I think it's about 8-9 meters
above sea water level so you can,
you can imagine what the…
You know, how bad it really was.
The chance of another cataclysmic event cannot be overlooked,
so Franky has built his own tower, just in case it happens again.
If it would happen again,
I would be, of course I would react completely differently because
then I know if there's an earthquake,
I would check immediately in the Internet what happened.
Where was the earthquake? What magnitude was it?
Then determine if there's real danger or not and act accordingly.
Here, actually, we see the water tower
which is, at the same time, also a tsunami safety feature
because it has two levels.
And the first level here is where people could gather up
in case there is a tsunami warning,
and if there's really a tsunami coming,
people could climb up the ladder to the upper level
where it's approximately enough space for up to 20 people, I would say.
And the structure is built especially strong,
with columns that would withstand a tsunami.
In Sri Lanka, businesses are being rebuilt and the landscape is recovering.
It may have happened ten years ago,
but the reminders remain, not only in the minds of the locals,
but also in the water-damaged buildings.
Sakthivell still finds it hard to live without his sister
because they weren't just twins,
they were also best friends.
This is the place where I release my grievances.
I get in touch with my lost sister's family
and always live with the memories which I had with them.
Because of that, this is very important
as well as very spiritually touched place,
individually to me, and personally to me.
Whenever I feel…
I'm alone, whenever I feel I am isolated,
whenever I feel I'm frustrated, I used to…
exchange energy, or something like that, with my own sister,
who is missing from me.
So during that kind of feeling, I used to visit that place,
kind of thinking about her a little, alone,
and get some advices or some kind of thoughts in that place.
I'm thinking about her contributions in my life, especially in education,
as well as my, yeah, my lifestyle. She contributed a lot.
She's my part of body, so she knows everything,
and she was able to feel me, coach me,
and carry many burdens from me.
And yeah, I miss that now,
and I'm going to miss her rest of my life.
Go to temple, again,
it's when we were small. Even though we were small,
in our tradition, boys have to stay in boys' panel,
and girls have to stay in girls' side.
So as I told you, she's pretty and she's smart,
and when we go to temple together, we get attention of many people.
That made me proud and that I miss now.
Sakthivell now wants to make sure that his kids
and their school friends know what to do in case
there is another tsunami.
We should really know what kind of things will happen to us.
So education related to natural disaster is important,
and it's the first priority rather than any other education
in the world according to me, because we're talking about our life.
With the passing of time, many memories tied to this tsunami
have been washed away, forgotten or buried.
While the lesson is painful,
we must remember what the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami has taught us.
What basically also teaches us that anything
except our life experiences that we have,
which are like stored in our brain, in our memories,
everything else doesn't really exist, you know.
So it can be gone tomorrow.
I feel really sad.
I want to cry, but, you know, I'm so lucky.
Make me stronger.
Before tsunami, I should say, I have a very professional life.
Selfish, planned life.
But after tsunami, oh, my God, it changed my life. A lot.
We can’t keep regretting what has happened.
Life must go on. Maybe I will become a better person after this.
Those who have survived must keep on living.
Life must go on.
Yes, ma'am. I'll prepare it right away.
-Oh, my! Dear, look at this. -I don't want it.
Why did I have to come too?
-What? -One moment, please.
I'll have the same.
But it's so boring!
Would you like something to drink?
I'll have another of the same.
You're the only passenger who's finished every meal since we left the moon.
It wasn't easy getting on the Haunzen.
You're going down to Earth to wipe out Mafty Erin, right?
I'm guessing you're a captain.
What's your opinion of Mafty Navue Erin?
What? How did you--
The Haunzen is a special flight. You need connections to get on it.
And most of the passengers today are Federation officials, cabinet members,
and their family members, on their way to the Adelaide Conference.
That's a well-tailored suit, but the smell is still on you.
You need to be more like him.
He's probably in the same business.
I see you're not interested in other people.
I suppose that's why you had to take the ring off your left hand.
Why, you!
My name is Gigi Andalucia. That was a rude way to address me.
My apologies.
I won't ask how you figured me out.
Don't laugh.
I know my lack of emotional restraint makes me easy to read.
As for Mafty, he's a dangerous individual.
He's disrupting the order of the Earth Federation government.
But the public loves Mafty.
They say he's Char Aznable come back to life, that he'll do what people want.
That's quite extreme.
According to Mafty, once they've assassinated all the Federation ministers,
all of mankind will have to leave Earth for the sake of the environment.
Without exception, right?
Yes.
All of humanity without exception. It's a childish idea, really.
You shouldn't dismiss the idea just because it's childish.
The world is a lot more complicated than that.
That's what they all say. You have to get your hands dirty.
What do you think?
The wheels of society must be greased, I suppose.
Everything you say is so predictable.
You've had your chance. It's my turn.
-Looks like a surveillance satellite. -Mafty must have destroyed it.
Now we have a blind spot in the Oceaniac airspace.
I wonder how the bigwigs feel about this.
They don't care, or they wouldn't be convening on Earth.
More than a century has passed
since mankind ventured into space to ease the burden of overpopulation.
It has been 12 years since Char's Rebellion.
So in her mind, I'm just like all the other ministers.
I guess I can't complain if Mafty kills me.
Is anything the matter, sir?
Not at all.
I've finally realized that you're my type, Ms. Flower.
Is that your go-to pick-up line?
It must be hard getting older.
No, not really.
For instance, I no longer get nervous when talking to a beauty like you.
That's enjoyable in itself.
When I was a teenager, my heart would race, and I'd be in agony.
This is better.
I'd rather have the heart racing.
You're just trying to replicate the thrill of your first love.
But you know just as well as I do that reality is different.
Touché.
Are you all right?
-Yes. -Put your seatbelt on!
Captain Kenneth!
What's going on?
Wait, Captain.
Minister Eyinstein!
Leave us out of this.
If it's Mafty, then they're here to kill you and the other cabinet ministers!
Mafty?
What the…
A wise decision.
Put the gun down on the floor, Captain Kenneth.
Don't look. It's best not to make eye contact.
Listen up, all you Federation cabinet ministers.
I am Mafty Erin.
This operation is not a purge.
In exchange for your lives,
we will obtain war funds from the Earth Federation government.
You will be released once the transaction is complete.
Of course, the same goes for you privileged people
who had the misfortune of being on this flight.
Calm down!
See? This is why I didn't want to go to Earth!
Stop it!
Stop screaming. It gets on my nerves!
-It's all right. -Purser! Get me the passenger manifest.
Next, Sauli Stahlberg, Communications Minister,
and his wife, Aila.
Raise your hand so we can see it clearly.
Douglas Higgins, Jupiter Development Agency Director,
and his wife, Fiana.
All right.
What do we have here?
Is the Inner Space Surveillance Minister traveling with teenage girls now?
What are you looking at, woman? Show me!
I think it's cute.
What?
A combination of Sudanese, Arabic, and Old Irish.
Isn't it ridiculous? It's barely even a name!
Mafty Navue Erin.
What's with you?
Show me the list! "Gigi Andalucia."
The seat beside you is reserved too. Why?
To prevent unwanted advances.
What?
She has a patron!
-A mistress! How scandalous! -Don't start, hon.
At her age? She's not even 20.
-Be quiet! -Listen, you.
How did you people find out about this vessel?
I told you to shut up!
But it's our job to investigate your organization--
You've got some nerve!
The Public Health Minister is dead.
You there. Clean up the mess your colleague made.
Someone, do it!
I will.
I've seen corpses of all kinds in the old wars.
You're…
Yes, that's me.
All right. Help him.
Gather some blankets.
Yes, sir!
No running!
Have you forgotten who you're dealing with?
We're Mafty Erin, and we mean business!
Can you pull on that side a little?
-Like this? -Yes, exactly.
Ma'am, please keep your voice down.
-They'll kill you! -Then kill me!
Got a problem?
-Do it! -Do it! They're fakes!
Do it! They're fakes!
Hey!
That could have ended badly.
What was your backup plan if you failed?
I don't know. I was running before I knew it.
I hope you're joking.
Our priority is securing the armed group!
Leave passenger safety to the second team!
Davao? Why? That's even further than Hong Kong.
Apparently, Mafty was taking us to Australia.
But if we get off here, how do we travel from here?
What…
I can't stand this humidity.
Those guys might not have been Mafty, just like that Gigi girl said.
My subordinates are on their way. Sorry about what happened.
I don't think they're Mafty. They lack the integrity.
You sound like you approve of Mafty.
They may be a splinter group from Oenbelli.
-What's Oenbelli? -A town in northern Australia.
I hear tens of thousands of dissidents have gathered there.
And they're calling themselves Mafty's Forces.
Captain Kenneth!
Lieutenant, hold these people in a military facility.
We'll claim them before the Bureau of Investigation.
Yes, sir!
Mafty forces in Oenbelli?
Please wait in the lobby.
We need your written statement
and your transfer flight has to be arranged.
Oh, and…
I never got your name.
I'm the newly-appointed commander here in Davao, Kenneth Sleg.
I'm Noa.
Hathaway Noa.
I'll have a ginger ale.
-Look, it's him! -Where's Chief Yeoksan?
Hathaway Noa!
May I have the honor of shaking your hand?
You were a soldier when you were younger, weren't you?
If we'd been taken prisoner,
it would have been a terrible blow to the Federation government.
Please allow me to introduce you to everyone!
Wait…
Now I remember. Hathaway Noa.
Your father was Captain Bright Noa of the EFSF 13th Independent Unit
and captain of the Ra Cailum.
During Char's Rebellion,
you joined the battle as a mobile suit pilot, correct?
The truth is, I stole it and just flew around in it.
They let it go because we won the war.
Don't be modest. You have extraordinary talents.
I'm Hundley Yeoksan of the Criminal Police Organization.
These people from the Bureau of Investigation need to interview you,
but we're in a bit of disagreement with Captain Kenneth.
We'd like you to remain in Davao until tomorrow.
Can you do that?
As long as I can get back to Manado tomorrow.
You mean Manado on Sulawesi Island?
I'm training as a botanical observer on the Minahasa Peninsula.
I see.
Under Professor Amada Mansun?
-Yes. -All right. Arrange a hotel for him.
If we leave it to the military, they might keep him here overnight.
Of course.
We can do the interview now if you like.
We're done for today.
"No revival without purification," right?
I believe the professor's philosophy applies to my organization as well.
Don't you agree?
Chief!
The Criminal Police Organization?
Is he Man Hunter's boss?
I know the chief called it a day, but can I ask you a few questions?
Sometimes our bosses are too laid back.
Of course.
Why did you smile?
I smiled? Really?
Me?
How did you know those guys were Mafty imposters?
Our bodies reveal who we really are.
Oh, I remember now!
I smiled because I realized who the real Mafty Navue Erin is,
the so-called "rightful king of prophets."
It's you, Hathaway Noa! You're Mafty!
As you can see, I'm just an ordinary young man.
You're honest. I like that.
This girl can see through lies.
You might not like the way I put this, but…
Go ahead.
What makes you think I'm Mafty?
You were on the Haunzen,
but you're far too young. And then I saw the way you fought…
That was all I needed.
Why?
I guess it's true what they say. We're clueless when it comes to ourselves.
-Tell me. -Isn't it obvious?
When you met those people using Mafty's name, you flew off the handle.
That's it? And you figured… No, never mind.
I won't tell anyone else about any of this.
I don't want you to dislike me.
But I can talk to you about it, right? How thrilling and fun!
Fun?
But you can kill people with words. I'd like you to keep that in mind.
That's not a figure of speech.
I…
I'd never want anything like that!
I…
Gigi Andalucia…
I'm not like that. I mean it.
I know.
But the truth is something that must be handled slowly and carefully.
Yes, of course.
I've come to understand that recently.
I see. It must be hard for you.
Idiot!
Forget everything we said here.
I can't forget it.
And I know you can't either.
Excuse me.
Ms. Gigi Andalucia, this way, please.
Coming.
Good grief.
I don't think it's like this.
You were sitting in your own seat, correct?
Yes.
And in Captain Kenneth Sleg's seat was a wounded cabin attendant.
The Captain was sitting in an empty seat behind you.
I see.
Well, thank you, Mr. Noa.
That's enough for today.
This is your hotel card.
It's yours now, so don't be shy.
We'll call you at 9:00 in the morning.
Please schedule for that.
If you like this place, you may extend your stay at the hotel.
Indefinitely?
Sure. As long as you're within Davao's jurisdiction,
the government will cover the charges on the card.
Wow! That's impressive.
But not half as impressive as you.
I don't understand how you managed to win that girl over.
What?
Is that all your luggage?
I suppose.
Hop in. We're staying at the same hotel.
Right.
What's the matter?
I'd hate to put us in danger, so I won't talk about it.
So there are 43 floors? What's on the top floor?
Yes, ma'am.
There's a restaurant, bar, and a dance floor.
Oh! Let's go dancing, Hathaway!
I'll pass.
Incredible.
We've prepared two-bedroom suites for each of you.
These rooms are amazing.
This is bad.
Oh, you can leave Hathaway's suitcase in this room too.
What?
Gigi, that's a bad idea.
Why?
I'll use the room they gave me.
But I don't want to be alone in such a big place.
Hathaway, you can use that bedroom.
All right. Please.
I'm glad you're in good spirits now.
I'm fine.
I came down to Earth to be in good spirits, after all.
-Will you be living in Hong Kong? -No.
I prefer the mountains of Japan.
Japan?
-Can you get in there? -Of course.
My mother's ancestors are from there.
So that's why you look like that.
Enough already.
The way Mafty does things isn't right.
If there's another way, Mafty would like to hear it.
-There is. -What is it?
The establishment of a dictatorship that is never wrong.
-Is that funny? -The thing is, see…
If a human being can pull that off, they'd be a god, more or less.
Then you'd better become a god.
By the time someone like that appears, all of humanity will be gods.
Are you talking about Newtypes?
There's no such thing.
-Didn't they teach you that in school? -Yes, ad nauseam.
Exactly.
I'm going to use the shower.
Go ahead. I'll use the other one.
I'd like to relax.
I don't want to have to be on my toes because you're around.
Same here.
It looks like my cover is safe, but…
That girl, Gigi…
How should I deal with this situation?
Why there, of all places?
Gigi.
I'd like to take a look around outside.
How dare you!
Look who's talking.
We're not married, and I didn't agree to stay with you.
And even if I had, I hate women who run about naked.
Did that hit a nerve?
Is she trying to seduce me?
I'm going out for a walk.
Gigi!
Knock yourself out!
So she's that kind of woman.
Was I being rash?
I must have been.
Just like with Quess Paraya.
Were you followed?
I checked carefully all around me, sir.
The schedule is fixed. We can't change it now.
I should hand this over to Iram, right?
What about Oenbelli?
It's true.
People who believe that Mafty's base is in Australia have been gathering there.
Did Quack Salver do this?
No. The general is happy about it, but we haven't had any contact with them.
-How many? -About 30,000, they say.
Incredible. You might even say our efforts have finally paid off.
-But you say Kimberley's made a move? -Yes, yesterday.
He has deployed the main force.
And thanks to that, we have more freedom of movement.
Yes, but their new commander looks like trouble.
I know.
The new commander sent for the new mobile suit, right?
-New mobile suit? -Word is they're testing it.
There doesn't seem to be a tracking function.
I'm not sure how it works exactly,
but it looks like payments made with the card are 100 percent anonymous.
They say the top officials have bottomless wallets.
I figured as much.
That's the system created in the corridors of power.
You're a diligent student, Mihessia.
You could live in luxury forever with this.
Don't say stuff like that in front of him!
I was joking!
Sorry.
What are your plans, Hathaway?
Tomorrow morning, you can assume
I'll be under surveillance by the military and the Bureau of Investigation.
Need a diversion?
If possible, I'd like to keep my Hathaway Noa cover intact.
And the woman with you?
I don't know if she'll help my cover or turn out to be a Federation spy.
What do you mean?
All I can say is, she'd be dangerous as an enemy.
Anyway, a diversionary attack would be a good idea.
It'll be dangerous.
My suite is on the 32nd floor. Aim higher, and I'll be fine.
Bad news! Hunters!
Remain where you are until we've checked your residence permits!
Mihessia,
you were forcibly deported once, right?
-Yes! -This way!
Someone else will pick you up.
Thanks.
I said to line up!
-Show me your permit, quickly. -I'm getting it.
Hey, you there! Wait!
-Hey, you! -Come on!
They're coming. This way!
Did they check you too? Your residence permit?
Of course. Does this happen a lot here?
Ever since the Federation Forces started building up, it's been terrible.
Why won't Mafty teach those Hunters a lesson?
Good question.
They act like they're an army!
The Hunters here are bad, aren't they?
It's always like this. I wonder why Mafty doesn't strike back.
You're right.
They should be taken out with the trash.
He's too eggheaded, though.
He's trying to get everyone up into space, right?
That, I don't understand.
The environment in Davao isn't that polluted.
But there's less greenery now and people can't fish, right?
There's enough for everyone on the island to eat.
But Mafty's talking about a thousand years in the future.
He must have a lot of time on his hands.
I'm too busy making a living to think that far ahead.
-Too busy? -Right?
When I'm focusing on getting money to pay off some bigwig
so I can get an Earth residency permit,
I can't even think about the day after tomorrow!
The day after tomorrow?
Gigi.
This is Huguest of the Bureau of Investigation.
Mr. Hathaway Noa, we've arranged a car for you at 10:00 tomorrow morning.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Hello!
What's this? A hero like you eating in a place like this?
Why are you here?
Isn't it obvious?
You ditched me to go for a walk, so I asked him to have dinner with me.
We're going now.
He's a busy man, but he was kind enough to make time for me.
Staying in the same suite? Not bad.
Where are you going?
I'm not telling.
You're spending the night together, right?
I've got to snatch her away before that.
Go right ahead. I'm not bothered.
You don't care?
I have no such intentions towards her.
More importantly, what about those statements?
We've decided to have the cabinet ministers come to our base.
In your case, after the Bureau is done with you,
you can just sign the statement I'm preparing for you.
I did some digging on you.
During Char's Rebellion, you were just a kid, but you shot down an enemy.
Yes, against military regulations.
It was a headache for my father.
You did it without any training, and that's a big deal.
Then again, you only pulled it off because the military was disorganized.
I suppose so.
I'm quite exasperated by my predecessor Kimberley.
Are you talking about him attacking Oenbelli?
He's doing it to spite me.
I was supposed to be assuming command in three days.
But he's looking for some battle results before he goes back to space.
You've got a lot on your hands.
I'm a commoner, so I'm used to it. I wish I had a better father.
Your father may end up being a weight on your shoulders.
You think so?
Thanks for waiting.
Captain, can you help me put this on?
Of course.
He's too eggheaded, though.
I don't mind them acting tough and taking on the big guys, but…
The way Mafty does things isn't right.
I know that. I know this way of doing things is…
So tell me.
Tell me how to destroy the depths of these mechanisms.
We can't all live on Earth together.
Something has to be done, or everyone who died during Char's Rebellion
Something has to be done, or everyone who died during Char's Rebellion will never be able to rest in peace.
will never be able to rest in peace.
As long as there are exceptions to the rules, people will try to cheat.
No obstacles in front of our Galcezon.
We'll enter the visible area in 100 seconds.
Expect to be intercepted immediately.
Roger that!
We're talking about those Kimberley goons. They'll take 15 minutes just to get here.
Word is they've got a newly appointed commander.
And a new model too.
Don't underestimate them, Gawman.
He just got here yesterday. It won't make a difference.
The fools left seven cabinet ministers sleeping like babies in Davao.
We withdraw after 10 minutes, no exceptions.
I hear you loud and clear, Mr. Civet.
Let's go, Golf!
Come on, Fencer!
Listen up, Gawman. The interval is 180 seconds.
Hathaway is…
Has Kimberley detected us already?
Do a good job, Golf and Fencer!
My condolences to the souls of those who get caught in the crossfire.
Forgive us.
Are they here?
Gigi! It's an air raid! Get up!
What?
Put your shoes on! This place is a target too!
Why?
Because those Federation bigwigs are staying here!
Is it Mafty?
I don't know. An air attack on an urban area is unheard of.
But you're Mafty Erin!
Mafty is an organization. It's not a single individual.
Liar.
Another minute and a half.
I can't stand this.
Guests first!
Hathaway!
Who are you?
-We're guests here. -Oh.
Sir.
It's fine. Let's get in.
This elevator isn't going to stall on us, right?
If we're bombed, it will stop.
Will our secret be out now?
Why did you ask me?
I was betting on your instincts.
Well then, clear up that confusing conversation from before.
They're regrouping.
Fencer?
Damn it! Hathaway!
Now run for it, lad.
I knew it. You do scary things.
Did you hear that? It sounded like bombs.
I think so…
They got us!
-We're done for! -Sir!
Gigi.
It's all right. It still works.
-What was all that shaking? -It's a Mafty air raid!
The Regent Hotel's on fire too!
Cabinet ministers are staying here too!
Hathaway!
This way!
Stay strong, sir!
You're leaving me?
Of course not.
Let's go!
Why is he running that way?
Yikes!
Dammit!
What?
A mobile suit!
If that's the new model, that means we've been played by Anaheim!
Damn, that new commander knows what he's doing!
Come on. If you're not going to fire--
Are you people insane?
What is he doing?
I don't like this.
It feels like your weakness has been exposed.
Damn it! You're getting on my nerves!
Dammit! What am I doing?
-Hey, up there! -Stand up!
It's coming down!
No way!
There's a park! Over there!
This way!
-Gigi, are you okay? -They're coming down!
I'm dealing with enemies… Many kinds!
Gawman?
Look up!
Gigi! Over here!
Gawman! Dammit!
It's all her fault.
Am I going to ruin it all again?
Emeralda…
I should just leave her and run over there!
-That's all there is to it. -It's horrible…
Why would they do this? I'm scared!
You're right. It's a horrible thing to do…
Never mind that!
Run for it!
Gawman…
See? I told you horses would be faster.
Those who tried to drive here are still stuck!
-Over there. -That?
Captain!
He's right! Because it can't be done…
Gigi! And Hathaway too!
Captain, I was so afraid!
Get in the cockpit. It's warm in there.
Okay!
See to this girl.
This way.
Is that it? The mobile suit from Mafty or whatever.
Yes. This is my first time seeing the real thing too.
That's the Penelope.
The Gundam I sent ahead of me, before I took this post.
A Gundam?
That must be your best pilot in there.
He can do better. The Penelope is capable of so much more.
Looks like I overestimated Lane Aim.
Lane Aim?
A Gundam…
Don't harm the prisoner!
That's our first Mafty prisoner!
We'll question you nice and slow. Look forward to it!
All right! Take him away!
They're a real headache.
I guarantee you we'll be seeing a video statement from Mafty soon.
Lane Aim!
Over here!
You took down one machine, but we lost three.
Is that the best you can do against actual pilots?
Sir!
You'd better buck up, or the Penelope goes to Hathaway Noa.
Hey, now!
You may go. Take good care of the Penelope.
Yes, sir!
He's exceptional as a test pilot but useless in actual battle.
He looks pretty game, though.
I used to be just like him.
What?
I'm reminded of the time I stole a mobile suit from the military.
I was full of misplaced confidence too, so I know how it feels.
Cold, isn't it? Go on in.
Want some?
Sure.
I thought she meant in another cup…
So you were in the air raid?
We were in the Tasaday Hotel.
Boy, that must have been rough.
It was really scary!
Hey, you! There's more over here!
-Yes, sir! -Get those vehicles over here!
What do you think?
Not bad for an outfit picked out of a military store.
Jeez, you're difficult.
Excuse me, the Captain is running late, but he would like to join you.
-I see. -What shall we eat, I wonder?
Someone from the Bureau of Investigation will be here at 10:00 to meet you as well.
Understood.
I've decided on the new name.
-What are you talking about? -The name of the Kimberley Unit.
The current name is lame, and I'm not obliged to keep it.
That said, "Kenneth Unit" would sound massively egotistical.
Well? Take a guess.
I don't know.
The South Pacific Unit?
That would be silly! It's the Circe Unit. Good name, isn't it?
It's weird. It doesn't sound tough.
Circe? I've heard of that.
Oh, I see! You mean that famous Circe?
Circe, the enchantress who makes fierce animals obedient.
Daughter of Helios, god of the sun.
That's right. It's the name of a goddess.
And Gigi, it would seem you have the power to make fierce men obedient.
What? Isn't that goddess…
Yes. You're special.
Gigi, spend the night with me.
Is this really the time for that?
What I mean is, you're a goddess of luck.
If you sleep with me, the Circe Unit will gain the powers of its namesake.
Captain!
Don't talk like that, it's distasteful.
What do we have here?
We have another contender for your affections, Gigi
Commander!
Search teams up to the 4th Squadron have been dispatched!
-How should we proceed? -Send them all out. All of them!
All of them, sir?
-Make the arrangements immediately! -Yes, sir!
What are you, five? You'll never win her heart that way.
You're right.
But I'm equally disgusted by your lack of sincerity, Captain.
Leave me out of it.
You should make up your mind.
And you should try to be less vulgar.
Why are you so awkward around her, anyway?
Did you get your heart broken real bad in the past or something?
I'll get some sleep before the Bureau of Investigation gets here.
Good idea. Thanks to Mafty, I won't be getting much sleep for a while.
They've killed 18 cabinet ministers now.
-What's wrong? -I was just thinking…
Mafty's lofty ideals won't save him if he keeps up the killing.
He'll have to die in the end.
Exactly. And I'll be the one to take his head.
I see. Thank you.
That concludes our investigation. You're free to go now.
Why were there so many ministers on that flight, anyway?
They must have known they were entering a Mafty hotspot.
-And they were in that conspicuous hotel-- -I wouldn't know.
I was assigned to this remote area. I don't know what goes on in space.
But one thing's for certain…
We'll be seeing a lot more of Mafty from here on.
Eventually, no one will care whether they're the real thing or imposters.
That said, they're essentially terrorists. The public won't support them forever.
You can leave that.
It's just junk now.
You're right.
Sorry about the mess, I just got transferred here.
It's too bad though.
I could've assigned the Penelope to you if you joined my unit.
I told you.
My combat feats were a fluke. They caused problems for my father.
I guess having a famous father isn't all sunshine and rainbows.
It wasn't that bad.
Plenty of girls approached me to talk about my father.
I'll be on my way, then.
Will you say goodbye to Gigi?
If I see her, I'll have second thoughts. Please give her my regards.
I don't know where she's settling down.
-You don't know? -It doesn't add up.
She gave us the address for an unoccupied apartment.
Did she actually keep her mouth shut?
No. She might be telling Kenneth everything she knows about me right now.
Mr. Noa, we'll be at the ferry terminal soon.
Thanks. You can drop me off around there.
In light of recent events, all passengers must undergo
security screening before boarding.
Passengers bound for Makassar with a stop-over at Manado,
please proceed to Gate 10 for boarding.
As we are still dealing with the aftermath of last night's events,
all inbound ships scheduled to arrive today have been canceled.
Guess I'll get an evening ticket.
In this day and age, we can no longer justify mankind's existence on Earth.
It is our sincere desire that you understand this.
The current Earth Federation government has forgotten why we migrated to space.
-What's this? -Mafty hijacked the airwaves.
Bunch of assholes. They're blowing our city up!
Filthy terrorists!
Welcome! Step right up!
Deliver this, will you?
Thank you!
Welcome!
-Wait up! -Over here!
-Hey, wait up! -Wait up!
Have you heard of the Nejen?
Come on! I've been paid for this!
Want me to explain the view?
No, I'm good.
So the sea isn't really your thing, is it?
That woman said so.
What? Oh, right.
Boy, I like an older woman!
That's nice. I wish I could find one too.
-The suitcase is in a coin locker. -And the key?
In my jacket pocket.
Hurry!
Come again some time!
Sure!
What's all this about?
I just bailed on the bizarre relationships I formed on the Haunzen.
I bet none of them realized they were with Mafty himself.
-No, Kenneth will figure it out. -What?
He'll figure it out, even if Gigi keeps my secret.
So Hathaway left without saying anything to me?
He said he might have second thoughts if he saw you.
Don't you think that's rude?
As a man, I sympathize with him.
Is that right?
When things are settled here, I'll take you to Hong Kong.
I've arranged a cottage for you until then.
How very kind of you.
Or perhaps you can't relax unless you keep me under surveillance?
I did some digging.
You applied for the Haunzen through Boundenwooden.
Are you related to him?
Of course not.
So why were you on the Haunzen?
Because I have a close relationship with Count Boundenwooden.
Now that you have the missing piece to my puzzle,
you probably regret wasting a cottage on someone like me.
You're joking, right?
The Count must be in his eighties.
That's right.
He's in good health, but he's also terribly lonely.
Your apartment in Hong Kong is unoccupied.
The Count bought it for me. I'm going to see it for the first time.
That explains a lot.
Disappointed? I'm not as pure as you think.
Don't worry. I'll be gone soon.
No, wait.
You can stay.
My instincts tell me you're a goddess of victory.
That's a stretch.
Soldiers who risk their lives in battle tend to be superstitious.
Really?
But Hathaway wanted nothing to do with me.
That's because he wasn't a real soldier.
And besides…
Gigi, what did you just say?
What?
What did Hathaway tell you?
Or perhaps you sensed something about him?
Emme.
Raymond.
That Iram! A damned midair pickup!
-You'd better get ready too! -What for?
Sorry, but I'd like you to lend Maximilian a hand.
-Hathaway! -Oh, Hathaway.
Mafty!
Civet. I'm sorry about Gawman.
-Don't be. -We'll have to think of a rescue plan.
Right.
-What about the Valiant? -It should be in position by now.
-And what about this midair pickup? -I talked with Mihessia.
Are we being overcautious?
No. It's a good idea.
Yesterday and today, we received cleartext requests for backup
from a group proclaiming to be "Mafty's 1st Army."
From Oenbelli?
The town's being attacked by more than ten of Kimberley's Gustav Karls.
Dammit.
Can't they see they're not helping?
We only have one chance.
I want to keep it from falling into Federation hands.
We're walking a tightrope.
That's what it's going to be from here on out.
What is it?
Looks like we've intercepted a signal from a nearby enemy submarine.
Unit 3, Fencer, all clear!
Roger that! Let's do this.
Golf, all clear! Civet!
2 Galcezon launching!
The submarine the signal came from hid behind Tidore Island
and seems to be in the sea, west of Makian Island.
We're counting on you, Civet.
You have permission to shoot them down. Take them out!
Leave it to us.
What's the submarine saying?
They're asking about the jet you arrived in.
They can't get a direct line with all these Minovsky particles,
but they can still get through to Davao by relaying the message to nearby vessels.
I've never heard of submarines in Davao.
It seems the new commander has been keeping himself busy.
Yes. We can't be too careful of Kenneth Sleg.
Captain Kenneth.
This is it, the cruiser that entered the bay once and then withdrew.
Press the Port and Harbor Bureau and the Naval Force.
Have them report on any movement no matter how small!
We're shorthanded here. Tell them to pull their weight!
Is the Davao police chief on the line?
Did we do it?
-I'm not sure. -We can't tell from above?
We need a little more time.
Iram.
We have no choice.
How long are we going to be on standby here, Lieutenant Lane?
How does it look?
You shouldn't have any trouble, but I can't guarantee you'll make it back.
What?
Am I really doing this?
Never mind, don't answer that.
We don't have any spare pilots available for this.
Emme, pick up the pace!
Get that data into the Messer, quick.
I know already!
This operation is beyond insane, Hathaway.
I'm sorry, Raymond.
It's all right. I'll make sure I get you there.
I'm counting on you.
This is an operation we can't let you take part in, Raymond.
Well, she's the one I feel sorry for.
The owner of the cruiser is a Side 3 parliament official.
At present, he's on a ship headed to Hong Kong
for the Adelaide Conference.
Message from the Naval Force!
Unidentified forces detected
over the center and west coast of Halmahera Island!
I keep telling you.
If I knew everything, that would be dangerous.
I really don't know anything.
Mr. Gawman Nobile.
-Yes? -I just remembered something.
You were looking at Hathaway Noa.
He's famous. He's the son of Bright Noa.
Hathaway is involved with Mafty. Am I right?
Yes, he's Mafty. He plays the role of Mafty Erin himself.
The "role of Mafty Erin"? Then someone must be pulling his strings.
Who is it?
If you don't want to talk, I'm happy to set you up as Mafty
and send you to the gallows.
I really don't know.
I've heard the rumors though.
They're saying Mafty's the ghost of Char Aznable.
Fine then.
If you won't talk, that makes it all the more fun for me.
A mobile suit?
It's the Penelope.
I'm Lieutenant Lane Aim.
Captain Kenneth said to use you as a hostage.
He wants me to use you as a shield if things go south.
-You bastards! That's low! -I have to disagree.
Unlike Mafty's indiscriminate terrorist attacks,
only one life will be lost… yours.
But that's not my style.
I guarantee your safety as long as I can fight in the Penelope.
-There's still room for more! -Man, that thing was an antique!
All right, take it away!
Hurry up!
What the hell's going on?
Apparently, three Kessarias and that new model have taken off from Davao.
They're headed this way!
But we sank that run-down submarine!
What's going on, Iram?
We'll ditch this base and join the Valiant and Seawrack.
Are you serious?
Matching azimuth angle to that of Cargo Pisa, which is ready for descent.
Wait.
Database variables are feasible. Disengaging booster bed.
Three, two, one.
Will we catch it?
Don't know. No one's ever done anything this crazy.
How are you doing, Emme?
Just make sure you don't mess up, Raymond.
That hurt.
Cargo detected! It's behind us, to the right!
Thirty degrees!
Yes, I can see it.
-Purging shields! -Activating visual display.
Emeralda, do a final sweep for nearby enemies.
Roger.
Above us, on the left!
What's that?
-The one from before? -I think so.
Raymond, enemy incoming!
Go for it, Emme!
There are no second chances now!
I'm fine with a little damage. Ram into it!
My thoughts exactly!
Here it comes. Don't leave it all up to the machine!
I'm doing it!
Well done, Emeralda.
Sorry.
My naivete led to this situation.
When it was time to return from Anaheim,
I boarded the Haunzen with my privileges as Hathaway Noa
because I couldn't resist the temptation of seeing the cabinet ministers
one last time before I killed them.
That was a mistake, and now my comrades are in danger.
Isn't that right, Quess?
If that's your answer,
I'll change.
I will change…
into Mafty Navue Erin!
Well done making it here on your own, Xi G.
Flying objects launched 150km off the west coast of Halmahera.
-Where's the Lane team? -They're 200km north of Halmahera.
It's unlikely we can contact them.
We have no choice but to trust Lane's judgment.
Keep transmitting to the Lane team!
It's him.
I've seen what he's capable of.
And if I'm right…
Mafty Navue Erin!
Is Mafty behind that too?
Lane team, intercept descending object.
I'll cut them off.
These confusing relationships and Gigi Andalucia too!
Damn gravity!
I'm hit!
The grim reaper won't come when you're ready for him, Hathaway.
Mind your own business!
I'm losing my touch! Is it because of Gigi?
The ocean!
If I don't get out now, the Valiant will be in trouble too!
This has to work out somehow!
What?
It dodged! But how?
Even Mafty can get hold of a Gundam.
A Gundam?
With a Minovsky flight system?
Don't follow! They'll target us!
Don't insult me!
I can handle this!
Take a good look! He's coming from the side this time!
On your right!
-Now climb! -I know!
I lost my footing! Landing on the small island, port side!
What's next?
Lane!
-So Mafty brought out a Gundam copy. -Get back, or he'll get us!
-Shut up! -Gawman?
Gawman! Have you betrayed us? Or are they using you as a shield?
Answer me!
A shield, you say? Don't insult me!
I'm not like Commander Kenneth!
Forget about me!
Destroy this new model! Please!
Penelope pilot!
Lane Aim! So you can't fight unless you have a hostage?
You're pathetic!
You know my name?
You can have him back! I was just following the Captain's orders!
Is this a trap? Should I believe him?
Lane Aim… An honorable man.
Gawman!
It's all hell from here on out!
So it would seem.
I didn't wait for you out of mercy, you imitation Gundam!
I want to settle this in one move. Can I do it?
You show him, Mafty!
Here he comes.
That fool!
He's fast!
You're not getting away!
I'm alive.
What's going on?
I saw him go down!
But I finished him off. How is this possible?
Is Lane safe and sound?
Considering the damage to his machine, it's a miracle he made it back alive.
See? You're a goddess of luck.
Am I? I don't feel it myself.
The fact that you've survived on your own is proof of your good fortune.
I have my own plans, though.
I feel bad for the Count.
You mean Hong Kong?
That's life for you. A never-ending string of obligations.
Yes, I suppose you could call it that.
Life can be such a nuisance.
I'm not that obsessed with living.
Not me.
-Hey! -You did great, Hathaway!
Julia, equipment repairs are the priority!
Jeez!
Beam rifle's gone.
He used it as a decoy to draw the Penelope's fire.
Like how?
I launched it, then sent it flying.
It fired the wrong way, and I almost got hit myself.
If you hadn't made that hit-and-run attack, I'd be dead.
Right, Hathaway?
Stay still!
Man, that must have been insane!
Dammit. The spare parts are probably at the bottom of the ocean.
Forget about it! The leader's machine gets targeted first.
It's mine. I got it from Hathaway.
If you're in good shape, we'll go scout out Oenbelli right away.
Got it?
You heard her.
Of course. The ship captain's already on it.
Maximilian will have to work his magic.
But Maximilian has a problem.
We only recovered half the spare parts for the Xi, and the rest sank.
Kelia?
I wasn't expecting you so soon.
Well, getting here from Hong Kong is a lot easier than returning from space.
Hathaway's father is still in the military, right?
Children don't always take after their parents.
That's a good point.
I think I'll test my luck and see if I'm as lucky as you say.
-I'll be here for two or three days. -That's a good idea.
That may just make things interesting.
Hurry.
We all know we need between eight to ten hours of sleep,
but we don't know how long a person can go without any shut-eye.
Insomnia is a physical disorder rooted in mental causes.
Stress and anxiety can trouble the mind and prevent us from falling asleep.
But usually, it won't last more than a couple of days.
Except in serious cases of clinical insomnia.
Extreme insomniacs experience a lack of sleep that lasts for months
or even years.
This is triggered by something more complicated than stress,
such as an impact from trauma.
So what happens if you stay awake for months or even years?
Can you imagine the side effects?
Just one or two sleepless nights are enough
to throw your mental capacity into disarray.
It's called a state of emotional deviation.
More than three nights without sleep
will cause acute confusion
and an onset of derangement or delirium.
Your perception of reality will be distorted.
And if the condition persists longer than that,
the symptoms will intensify into auditory and visual hallucinations.
You won't be able to tell what's real and what's not.
When I was in med school like you guys,
sometimes, I went without sleep for nights working on projects.
One time, a lab rabbit started talking to me.
It prattled on and on.
Well, at least the rabbit kept me company
all night long.
Not lonely.
Three nights, that's the longest I ever went without sleep.
I was in Grade 9
when June and I moved to live with our grandma.
Ever since I've lived there,
I'm obsessively concerned with the safety of the house.
Every night, I compulsively check the locks.
I know I've already locked all the doors,
but I can't stop myself from rechecking.
It gives me peace of mind.
And lately…
June has started coming home late.
I'm worried about her.
Sometimes, I have to call her a dozen times before she'd answer.
The number you dialed cannot be reached right now.
Whenever I can't fall asleep,
I'll just consciously stay awake.
In the past few weeks,
I've been studying late until 2 a.m.
At 3 a.m., I have to go to the market to buy ingredients.
Look at the bright side of it,
I make the most of my 24 hours.
Not a second wasted.
NOTICE OF LATE HOME LOAN PAYMENT
AMOUNT DUE 782,155 BAHT
June.
Oh, you're back finally.
Yes, I'll get changed and go back to school.
Hurry up and come down for breakfast.
Do you hear me?
Dropping out of med school?
Jane, I know you have financial problems at home.
But let's try to find a way.
There's a lab assistant job available.
Have you tried that?
I've already asked.
But the pay is so low that it's a waste of time.
It'd be a waste, too, if you abandon everything right now.
What about June?
She could help out after school.
Two heads are better than one.
Oh, I have an idea.
Jane.
Jane!
Yes.
I just remembered…
a German pharmaceutical company has been in touch.
They're looking for volunteers for a new drug research.
I've heard they pay good money.
And I figured that
from your interview on insomnia,
you should be qualified for it.
What do I have to do?
Qratonin is a substance that comes from a part of the brain called thalamus.
Qratonin can be used to treat brain-dead patients,
and this substance only releases when we're awake.
So we started the experiment called…
Deep.
The Deep process consists of three levels.
The higher the level,
the more concentrated Qratonin becomes.
And the duration of each level
may vary from person to person.
This experiment must only be conducted by Weimarer personnel.
Hello.
My name is Hans Miller.
And I am the Director of Research of this facility.
Firstly, I would like to say thank you so much for coming today.
-What is your name? -It's Jane.
Jane, have you heard of Alexander Fleming?
Is he the one who discovered penicillin?
Correct.
When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin,
he revolutionized the pharmaceutical business.
Now, Qratonin will do exactly the same.
One question.
Why does this Qratonin only release when we're awake?
Now, have you heard of the substance melatonin?
Yes. Isn't that the substance to help with our sleep?
Excellent.
Melatonin helps us sleep.
And Qratonin will do the absolute opposite
and keep us awake.
Last question.
How much money will I get?
For Level 1,
you will get
100,000 baht.
Okay.
By participating in the Deep process,
you will need a microchip implant in your occipital area.
This microchip will only extract Qratonin from the brain.
Now, as long as you have the microchip in your neck,
you must wear this watch.
It will measure your heartbeat
and the amount of Qratonin that we have harvested, in percentage.
When it reaches 100%, you must come back here immediately.
And then we can remove the microchip from your neck.
I have to remind you,
that you have signed an agreement.
This experiment is secret and we don't want you talking to anybody.
Because we do not want our rivals to hear what we're doing.
Okay.
All right, that's all set!
The Level 1 process has started.
Oh, there is one thing you should know first.
You must not fall asleep, ever.
If you fall asleep for more than 60 seconds,
the microchip may short-circuit,
and it may stop your heart.
Don't worry if you fall asleep.
This watch will warn you before reaching 60 seconds.
I guarantee you, it's safe.
Grandma!
I'm all right.
I dropped my denture.
-Next time, let me know if you need help. -My body is aching all over.
Don't strain yourself too much.
Sit still while I massage you.
Okay, that's enough.
See? You're too active for your age.
You never listen to me.
I need to move now and then.
Or my joints would all go stiff.
Right, Jane. Have you seen the notice?
We're several months behind on the mortgage.
It's okay, Grandma.
I'll take care of it.
Don't lose sleep over it.
Don't tire yourself out. You've worked so hard.
Now, relax.
What?
What did you just say?
Stop pulling my leg.
Who's that?
June!
What?
Who drove you home?
It's a ride-hailing app.
Why did you sit in the front?
If not, regular cabbies would harass us.
And why didn't you text me back?
Hey, answer me.
What the hell.
I'm out of data, okay?
-Then why don't you answer my calls? -I had band practice.
All night?
I see.
You think I'm sleeping around?
What would I rather think?
Fine, I'll sleep around if that's what you want me.
Give me an abortion when I get knocked up. You're a doctor, aren't you?
Hey!
So you're on Deep, aren't you?
What's Deep?
Win, our top-class party animal.
He spends more time in nightclubs than in the classroom.
Me too.
You're not supposed to tell anyone.
It's just between us.
How did you get in?
Professor Nichcha?
Yes.
I met their qualifications.
You must be good at staying awake too.
But you know what?
It's not just us two
who are professional insomniacs.
Look.
Cin, the famous beauty blogger and the school's celebrity in residence.
Whatever she does,
-her followers go crazy about it. -Hi, everyone. Let me show you
this super awesome Korean essence water.
I really recommend it.
Just a few drops. And rub it through.
Cin's high school grades were brilliant. Her family forced her to study Medicine.
Although she wanted to study Communications.
School stresses her out so much that she barely sleeps.
So she relies on sleeping pills all the time.
What's with you, Win?
You shouted my name like a maniac.
Oh, Jane is on Deep too?
You know what?
Wherever Cin is,
this guy is always there.
Peach!
Peach!
Peach, the game nerd.
When he's not studying, he lives in online games.
Games, games, and more games.
He has a thousand friends in the virtual world.
But in the real world, it's the total opposite.
Hi.
You too, Peach?
So when did you sign up?
Yesterday.
Same day as me.
How come you still look…
radiant?
Look at my panda eyes.
I'd never do it if not for the 100,000 baht.
So everyone gets the same deal.
Of course. Easy money.
I can keep doing it forever.
You're a movie marathon winner after all.
How about you, Peach?
How are you holding up?
-Good. -You, Cin?
Easy-peasy.
The 100,000 baht definitely keeps my eyes wide open.
Keep it down.
Oops.
Aren't you scared?
If we fall asleep,
we're dead.
No.
Just stay awake
and we stay alive.
You can say that again.
Look, my Qratonin is almost full.
Let me see yours.
Cin?
Oh, 77%! Way ahead of us.
And you're so behind, Peach.
Anyway, I don't have your LINE IDs.
Let's exchange contacts,
so we can have each other's backs.
Instagram accounts, too.
Follow me on that, guys.
Hi, everyone.
It's still too early to hit the sack.
Let's play a game tonight!
Look!
I love you.
Help me name this show and get this doll if your entry has the most likes.
ALL-NIGHTER LIVESTREAM WITH CUTIE CIN
WHY USE FINN MOBILE?
OUTSTANDING DEBT 658,901 BAHT
Not impressed.
I should turn pro.
Yuck.
Guys…
Since I've been on Deep, I feel like…
someone has been stalking me.
The other day, I heard this strange sound.
I checked it, but there was no one there.
Probably a serial killer.
Not funny, I'm dead serious.
If the Deep lab asks you to do another round,
will you accept it?
Whoo!
Why not? It's easy money.
We made it through Level 1 in one piece.
They'll pay even more for Level 2.
But we'll be expected to go without sleep much longer.
No sleep…
no problem.
Yes, I'm in.
With more money I can get a boob job in South Korea.
Big, big boobs.
Okay, let's start a group chat.
If they get in touch, we can go together.
-Okay? -Good.
What shall we call our group?
How about "Deep Process Group Research"?
Sounds like a term paper!
How about…
"Sleepless Gang:
the World Is Shocked
That Some People Get Paid For Not Sleeping."
-Good? -Idiot.
Then what?
How about "Non Non"?
"Non Non"?
-What's that supposed to mean? -Right.
-It's N-O-N. -What's Non?
-Non means no. -Okay.
The second "non" is the Thai word for sleep.
"Non Non" means "no sleep."
-Right, I get it. -Non Non.
That's wicked!
Let's go with that. Cool name.
-Are you sure? -Of course. I'm doing it.
-Okay, "Non Non" then. -Are you in?
I am. Join the group. Non Non.
Ladies and gentlemen,
here we are… Non Non!
Watch us conquer all Deep levels!
All right.
We don't get to sleep,
but we'll get so rich!
Cheers!
-Now, let's play more bowling. -Okay.
Cin and Peach, you're on the same team.
-Fine. -I have to go.
-What's the hurry, Jane? -Right.
-We've got lots of time. -I've got something to do at home.
See you.
See you then.
Bye.
See you, guys. Bye.
Cin!
-What? -Take him along. He'll go by taxi, too.
-Come on. -Go on.
See you.
Bye.
Come.
Go.
Hurry up.
What's with you, man? I don't have COVID-19.
I think…
it's a side effect of Deep.
I think I have…
butterflies in my stomach.
Which name should I pick?
ALL-NIGHTER LIVESTREAM WITH CUTIE CIN
CINDERELLA AFTER MIDNIGHT
This one,
"All-Nighter Buddy, Livestream Marathon
with Cutie Cin."
Okay.
But I guess
anyone who came up with such a name
is either an idiot
or a psycho.
Don't you think?
I…
You have to watch out.
There are more psychos around than you think.
I'm worried about you.
Worried about me?
You have a crush on me?
No!
I mean we're friends.
We have to watch out for each other.
Right?
Peach!
Don't forget to subscribe to my channel.
Bye.
You must see me passing by For you to know that I like you
Just remember that every time you see me
June.
What's this?
I broke your old one.
And the sim card?
You always ran out of data.
I got you an unlimited data plan.
So no more excuses for not replying to my texts.
Where did you get the money?
From my part-time job.
Doing what?
You're home already, son.
Hi, Mom.
You didn't answer your dad's calls.
Because he kept calling me all day.
He's really upset with your grades.
Mom, I did my best.
I told you I never wanted to study Medicine.
You have to try harder.
Your dad's family are all doctors. Just do it for him--
It's not genetic, is it?
Studying Communications wouldn't kill off his good genes.
Great, no allowance for you this month.
You're on your own.
Fine.
I can support myself!
Level 2 will take longer than Level 1.
So that we will get more concentrated Qratonin.
How many days will it take?
Each person is different.
But based on your past performance, I would guess…
about five days.
Five days! Can we make it?
Tell him if you can't.
How much?
500,000 baht.
DEBT 165,784 BAHT
Win!
Win!
Do a backdoor cut. Come on.
The backdoor cut. Do it.
Win, are you okay?
Go play with kids, sucker.
No wonder his mom died.
No wonder his mom died.
-Let me go. -Win!
Did you hear what he just said?
Calm down, man.
Are you nuts? He didn't say anything!
Are you all right?
What's wrong with him?
You're drilling a hole in the lock.
June.
Next time, clean it after use.
It's gross.
Stop!
You told me to practice at home, didn't you?
You got all day to practice.
And you got all day to study.
Don't make me kick you out.
Hey,
what's with this mood swing?
Honestly, what have you been up to?
Your obsessive fuss over the locks, the stove,
and checking on Grandma a thousand times.
It's getting worse every day.
Tell me…
what your part-time job is.
Tutoring.
You expect me to believe that?
Tutoring won't bring in that much,
even if you do it 24 hours a day.
What I do is not your goddamn business.
See, you always get grumpy and yell at me.
I have the right to know what's going on.
What do you know?
I have to work to pay the bills.
Do you know how much sleep I've lost over this?
Don't change the subject.
-I'm asking, what have you been up to? -Leave me alone!
-Let me see. Go check if it's correct. -Okay.
Jane, help me clean this.
Are you okay?
I've had enough!
-The percentage is still very low. -Shhh.
Besides us,
there are many others on Deep.
How do you know?
Their watches.
But I guess it's only us who are on Level 2.
What a mess.
We look like zombies.
Shit.
Last time, the number kept going up.
Is it broken or something?
Win, you work out regularly?
Yes, why?
We started Level 2 at the same time.
Our readings shouldn't have been so much different.
But yours is clearly higher than the rest of us.
I think it has something to do with body movements.
The number goes up when we keep moving.
I think I know what to do.
When you fall, just get up When you fail, keep calm and carry on
You're still alive
So be strong
Don't let life beat you down
Keep on fighting and don't give up
Live life to the fullest Don't let it wear you down
Get back on your feet Be ready to take on the world
Damn, my connection sucks.
Why don't you use Finn Mobile? It has a good Internet service.
You can use my code to get a discount.
Both you and I will get a discount all the way.
Can you go home and be with Grandma? I won't be home tonight.
I can't hear you.
I said go home and take care of Grandma.
All right, I will.
I didn't know that weirdo is so rich.
And I never knew he's such a dope.
And you, I just realized you're quite crazy.
I've been so stressed out lately.
What do you usually do?
Study.
Study.
And what?
And study.
That's why you're always at the top of the class.
When you're not studying, what do you do?
Help out at home.
Help out with what?
Well,
cooking, setting the tables, selling the food.
What about your parents?
Breaking news report. There's a report of a murder.
Jane.
It occurred in a townhouse in Bangna District.
The authorities investigated and found that the owners were dead.
Jane.
There were no signs…
Jane.
of forced entry at the crime scene.
Jane.
What about you?
What do you do when you're not drinking?
I drink,
drink,
drink
and drink.
Your parents have no problem with that?
Well,
my mom is dead.
It's all right!
It was a long time ago.
I'm okay.
Anyway, don't worry about us falling asleep tonight.
I've got a plan.
See, you're wide awake.
Right?
Yes.
One more?
-Sure? All right. -I'm awake.
Win comes up with a plan
to help us sail through the fourth night.
He mixes stimulant pills
in sweet-looking mocktails.
Where did you get them?
Courtesy of the Faculty of Pharmacy!
But Crenyl can cause strokes.
Are we going to die?
Are you crazy?
Look, Jane.
We have to make it through the night.
If we fall asleep,
it means we're dead.
Nothing else can keep our tired eyes wide open.
Fine. I'll throw them away.
Jane.
Why are you sitting there alone?
Come dance with me.
Oh, you can't dance.
It's all right, dear.
I'll teach you.
Come on, get up.
Then I don't remember anything.
Except that I had such a great time.
Hi, everyone. Today, I'll show you what my everyday life looks like.

Let's go.
I love you.
You have to watch out.
There are more psychos around than you think.
Cin.
Cin.
Cin.
Cin.
-Cin! -Peach,
what the fuck is this?
Answer me!
-Can't find her pulse. -Shit!
Cin.
Cin, wake up!
Is she going to die?
Is she okay?
It's all because of you!
Not now!
Win!
-Win. -Let me do it.
Cin, wake up!
Cin!
Don't die, please.
Don't die. Do you hear me?
Peach!
How many seconds left?
Peach, answer me!
Peach!
-Twenty seconds. -Cin, wake up!
Cin!
Cin!
Now?
Ten seconds.
Come on.
Win, move!
We will not do it anymore.
Why?
Nobody's done it better than you guys.
Don't you see how bad it is?
I almost died.
But Deep Level 3
will bring you one million baht each.
Sorry.
After Cin's near-death experience,
we've decided not to go back on Deep again.
I'm off now, Grandma.
Cin.
Cin!
I…
I did what I did
because I like you.
Cin!
I'm…
I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?
Stop following me or I'll call security.
I…
I can explain everything.
I…
I boosted your "likes"
and watched your clips over and over
because I wanted to give you as much support as I can.
So you turned all psycho on me?
I'm really sorry.
Can we still be friends, please?
Not now.
Your scores have dropped drastically.
This is your favorite subject, isn't it?
I haven't had time to study lately.
Don't tell me it's because of that research job.
It is.
Come on, Jane.
If it's costing you your grades,
just quit it.
I'm concerned about your performance.
Actually, it's more complicated.
But never mind.
I already quit.
Med schools demand a lot from students.
But a lot of people would die to have your opportunity.
You're still young. You can make money later.
Jane.
I slept like a rock last night.
How could you wake up before class?
I barely made it myself.
So what are you doing this evening?
I've got two tickets for the Ed Sheeran concert.
Come with me?
I can't.
It's only a couple of hours.
Come on.
Why don't you ask Peach and Cin?
Those two have a lot to sort out.
Are you hitting on me?
Uh-huh.
I don't think of you that way.
Don't waste your time.
I need to focus on my studies, and take care of Grandma and my sister.
I don't have time for that kind of thing.
Sorry.
Out of the blue There's something that keeps me up
I've been thinking about it Back and forth all night
Out of the blue, there's a story of you
What does this mean?
Out of the blue There's something that keeps me up
I've been thinking about it Back and forth all night
Out of the blue, there's a story of you
What does this mean?
Stop crowding around.
Let us through.
Stop crowding around. Please make room.
Grandma.
Grandma.
Grandma!
Jane.
How's Grandma?
She has a stroke and needs an operation.
But we have to move her to another hospital.
Why?
We can't afford it here, June.
I'll talk to the doctor about the transfer.
Is this enough?
Where did you get it?
Are you on Deep?
Yes, so what?
But how?
You should have told me before you did it.
It's very dangerous.
You did it too.
People have died in that experiment, you know that?
I only have to stay awake.
You're not the only one who can save her.
June! Don't be so arrogant.
Bullshit.
I just wanted to help.
She's my grandma too.
You can do anything but I can't.
Keep your voice down. We're in a hospital.
Fuck it.
June!
Mrs. Duangjai's family?
Please come in.
Where's all the stuff in Mom's room?
Say it!
She's gone. Why hang on to them?
She's gone but her things must stay.
You can't throw them away just like that!
Damn, what were you thinking?
I don't want us to be stuck forever with her memory.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Without her things, we'll forget what happened.
If that's what you think,
why didn't you do it three years ago?
If you want to forget her,
be my guest.
Don't expect me to do the same.
Or maybe you just want to forget the fact
that you couldn't save her.
I tried, Win.
But there was no way I could save her.
If you were in my shoes, you'd understand.
-Your mother was beyond help. -Listen to yourself.
No wonder she killed herself.
Win!
What kind of person are you?
You gave up so easily.
If I had a chance to save Mom,
she would've still been alive.
The number you dialed cannot be reached right now.
I only have to stay awake.
I just wanted to help.
-You can't come in. -I want to see Dr. Hans.
You can't!
Miss.
Miss!
You have to leave now!
Why did you do this to me?
I didn't do anything.
This is your sister's decision.
I told you I can help with the money.
-Stay out of my business. -Shut up, June.
Take the chip off now, or I'll call the police.
You didn't read it carefully, did you?
That's unfortunate, and…
I'm sorry.
Let me tell you something.
Instead of trying to sue me,
why don't you bring your friends back here?
Even if you give us a million, no one will do it.
If you don't bring your friends back for Deep Level 3,
I'm not going to remove the chip from your sister.
And that means
she's going to die.
June, let's go.
Be hurry, Jane!
Your sister's Deep Level 3 treatment has started!
Tick-tock…
Tick-tock.
You've heard what happened.
I'm at my wits' end.
I know, Jane.
But we barely made it through Level 2.
Level 3 will be as good as suicide.
But if we do it carefully,
there's still a chance we'll beat it.
Without your help, my sister will die.
Jane.
I can't take the risk.
I don't want to die.
Sorry for being blunt.
But risking four lives to save one
sounds like a bad bet to me.
The only reason you're still breathing
is Jane.
She saved your life.
Or you wouldn't be sitting here.
I know it's very risky,
but I'll help her.
I'm so sorry, Jane.
Cin, I'm begging you.
I don't know what else I could do.
Sorry.
Peach.
Peach!
Jane.
Don't worry, you still have me.
I wasn't thinking straight.
Now, I've put everyone in trouble.
It's okay, June.
We need the money for Grandma's treatment anyway.
Right?
I'm sorry, Jane.
No matter what happens, I'm always with you.
The texture of this cream is totally different.
It's pretty light.
Peach!
I knew you'd come!
Hello, my friends.
Jane.
There are three of us now. I think we can negotiate with Dr. Hans.
Then let's go see him.
Don't start without me.
I don't like being indebted to anyone.
What's with the smile?
If we want to go Deep, let's go Deep. Before I change my mind.
Are you ready?
You already have a plan, right?
The plan is to get help from someone we can trust.
I'm going to give you Exerall every day.
It'll keep you alert.
Thank you so much.
No, I owe you an apology.
I shouldn't have sent you to that horrible research.
It's all right.
It's not your fault.
It was our own decision.
Anyway, thank you for allowing us to stay here.
Everyone, make yourself at home.
This is my father's old ward.
All equipment is still working fine.
The intercom is over there.
You can buzz for me if you need help.
I have a class to teach now.
Make yourself at home.
Call me immediately if there's anything wrong.
You have my number, right?
Yes, I do.
Really, are you going to do your online thing now?
Yes, what else am I supposed to do here?
Whatever.
Let me tell you why Finn Mobile is so special.
It comes with a great package.
You pay less and get more.
With the maximum speed of 10 Mbps,
you can enjoy movies, series, and games with unlimited data,
plus all online services.
Easy and convenient! Right?
In the brutal murder case,

Shit!
Cin, are you all right?
What happened?
Cin!
Cin!
Don't touch me, psycho.
Cin, calm yourself.
Let me look at your wound.
My face looks like shit because of your sister.
I've become a walking corpse
because of you!
You put me in this fucking mess!
Take it easy, Cin.
Easy, my ass!
Just look at my face!
Cin, listen to me.
Pull yourself together.
You think you can win Jane's heart by doing this?
Let me tell you something.
It doesn't matter how hard you try,
she'll never look at you twice.
Come on.
You think being a nice guy,
trying to save her sister and all that shit
-is so fucking cool? -It's none of your business!
Win!
Calm down, Win.
We're all friends.
Friends?
A friend won't point a finger and bark at Jane and her sister!
Let's sort this out calmly.
You never had any friends,
-how could you understand anything! -Win.
No one wants to be friends with a sick nerd like you.
Win.
Win, no! Win!
You asshole.
How dare you!
Win, stop!
-Let me go! -Win!
Think you're so tough?

Hello.

You're not supposed to be here.
Cin, call the police.
What?
Professor Nichcha is behind everything.
What did you say?
Professor Nichcha is behind Deep.
Call the police now.
Shit, no signal.
Kids…
I've cut off the signal.
Nothing.
Move!
Shit.
It's locked!
Please let us out!
Please.
Professor!
Professor Nichcha!
I will let you out,
only when I get the chips from all of you.
Come and get it now, bitch.
I will remove your chips
only when the percentage is full.
Fuck.
Or…
Peach, help!
When you are dead.
I know you're watching us.
I'll kill you.
You'll never get the chips.
Fuck you.
Bitch.
Win.
Win.
Win.
Win!
Win!
Win!
Mom.
You.
We're lucky to have found CCL.
The drug can cause temporary cardiac arrest.
We won't go anywhere.
We can't make the chip 100% full,
but we can fake death.
Why are you doing this to us?
That's Jed,
the love of my life from 24 years ago.
He used himself as a subject for his own research.
Extended sleeplessness drove him into a fit of hallucination.
He fell from a building
and went into a coma.
Years later,
I found a way to extract Qratonin
from the brain of sleep-deprived humans.
Jed responds positively to the treatment.
But Qratonin from just one person is not enough
to wake him up--
You're risking people's lives for your own benefit.
Are you still human?
Cin, I never wanted anyone to die.
But someone actually died.
What do you have to say?
Jane,
that was just a glitch.
If she had followed the instructions, she would've been fine!
I've done everything I can, you know it.
And you know how I always care about my students.
I've always looked after the four of you.
If I had wanted you to die,
I wouldn't have brought you here.
I've tried everything on myself.
Let me show you.
All I want is to bring back the man I love.
You really don't get it?
What you're doing is wrong!
You know how painful it is
to lose someone you love.
I know you do, Jane.
And if you were me,
you would do exactly the same.
Let's call the police.
ANESTHETIC DRUG
Jane!
Jane!
Jane!
Win, Peach, help!
Peach, get her.
-Jane. -Move, June.
Jane.
Jane.
Jane!
June, get the AED.
-Jane! -June, take the pads out.
Put one on her left rib. Press it firmly.
The other one on the right collarbone.
June, move.
How's Jane?
Still unconscious. Everyone, back off!
I'll shock her.
Jane!
Jane!
Wake up.
No matter what happens, I'm always with you.
Jane!
You said you'd always be with me!
Jane!
Jane!
Jane!
Professor Nichcha has been arrested.
All students who have taken part in Deep
have had their chips removed.
No one has gotten paid for joining Level 3.
All your mom's stuff that I gave away,
I will get it back.
I love you, son.
Come on.
Come on.
What are you waiting for?
It's heavy.
What?
Grandma, did you see that?
Jane is so hard to please.
Snitch.
I'll tell her what you did.
What did I do?
Guys, I want to tell all my followers
to see my life as a case study.
We should go ahead and do what our hearts tell us to do
regardless of the outcome.
Because whatever happens, it's our own choices.
Cin has decided to quit med school
to study Communications as she always wanted
and has quit the pills that help her sleep.
NITE NITE, GUYS.
Go to sleep, Jane.
Come on.
I said sleep!
Peach has learned that living with friends in the real world
makes him just as happy as in the virtual world.
Hey, Peach!
Peach!
Finally, everyone chooses to sleep like a rock
rather than to sleep like the dead
