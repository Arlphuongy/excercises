Kabir, say a prayer before you leave.
Let's get moving!
Kabir, our video has crossed a million views.
Let him be, Tony.
Kabir is a bit silent, isn't he?
He's angry. Why?
Because he lost his mother, and now his home.
He's angry about moving to Old Delhi.
Titu, your scooter!
Asshole, wearing blinkers, are you?
You moron!
Are you mental?
-Hey, don't you dare hit me! -Well, your truck hit my scooter first!
-Stop shouting! -Should I start singing then?
Stop!
Kabir, let go of him!
Hey, what's going on! Stop fighting!
The driver made a mistake.
Greetings, Uncle.
Snake dance! Snake dance?
Stop it!
-Pick up your scooter. -Uncle, I am Ved Prakash's son.
Saw you in dad's wedding album. You were doing the snake dance.
-He's Dheela's son. Dr. Dheela! -Dr. Dheela?
-That's you? -Greetings, Uncle.
God bless. How's everything? All good?
Help move our things!
-Uncle, this way. -Yes. Let's go.
Careful!
The bag's quite heavy.
Kabir!
-Kabir! -Uncle, follow me!
Mind your head, Uncle.
Nothing's changed here.
-Yes, Uncle. -How's your father Dheela?
All good, Uncle.
An injection costs a dollar now...
-Hello. -Hello.
And the red pill still saves the day!
He's started his own hospital. Keeps busy.
Open the windows. Let the air in.
Anees, there are 32 cartons and bags.
All here.
Hey, where to? For my band rehearsals.
Not now! We're going to Kuljeet's for lunch.
His mother, Beeji, is cooking. Don't miss it.
I'll go fetch dad.
-Take off that garland. -Here, you put it on.
-What do I do with it? -Hey, bring it here!
-Hello, Beeji! -Welcome, son!
Let's go in. It's cold outside.
-Come, everyone. -Come here.
-Coming! -Come here, Mathur.
-Come, let's stand in a group. -Beautiful. See!
Stop sulking, Mittal.
Look here.
Pout, everyone.
-Pout? -Here!
Wait!
Dr. Dheela is here!
-Mr. Dheela! -Heâ€™s slow, just like his name.
Let's pout.
Done.
Take them off!
Come, take a selfie with Beeji.
This kiss can heal.
It will make your skin glow!
Look how beautiful we look!
-Eat now. -I need a spoon.
Who eats Rajma Chawal with a spoon?
Exactly.
I always eat with a spoon.
No problem. Sapna, get him a spoon.
This is the new generation.
Anees, a few spoons, please.
You know, the dress that I'm wearing...
your mother had given it to me 15 years ago.
You remember?
Even now people ask where it's from. It's still in fashion.
It's your mother who taught me about style and fashion.
I didn't know anything.
I don't think you know how mod your mother was.
If she would've been here, she'd have made me cut my hair short--
-What happened? -Kabir!
You crocodile!
Why did you have to be a drama queen?
Didn't even let him eat the rajma!
How could he? He remembered his mother! What's more important? "Ma" or "Rajma"?
You missed the rehearsals and didn't show up for the gig either.
-Tony's pissed off! -He can go to hell!
He says the same to you.
He has started a new fucking band without us.
Anees Uncle! Water!
Potty is potty.
What difference does it make if it's Indian or western?
Hello, Uncle.
He smiled.
-That smile cost me 9870 bucks. -Is it?
Bought an English throne for my spoilt child.
Wow! Such delicious food!
Titu's wedding. Traffic jam. Waste of money.
You have something to say to me or not?
Take those off.
Do you have a tongue?
Can you speak at all?
What do you want to hear?
Tell me. I am listening.
Do you have anything to talk about?
Tell me!
If he won't talk to you, learn to "chat" with him.
Son, it's important to to keep up with the technology.
She's right.
Tell me. If I learn all this...
this communication gap between me and Kabir...
can it be fixed?
I'll explain.
The awkwardness we feel face to face... vanishes with this device.
This generation speak with their fingers rather than their mouths.
What if, at this age, I am unable to learn?
If she can, anybody can.
Excuse me! I'm a Science graduate!
Home Science doesn't make you a scientist!
Okay, Beeji. Here.
Put that technology stuff into my phone.
This phone is no good.
What's wrong with it? You need a smart phone.
It is smart.
You are, not your phone.
Beeji, stop making me spend so much.
He's saying he wants Facebook in this phone!
You guys are insulting me!
Sir, this is the hottest item in the market right now.
In this you'll get a 64-bit Octa core processor.
With a 16 GB memory.
And a 14 centimeter HD screen.
Okay...
It's an auspicious day.
The phone will bring me luck if I buy it today.
Sir, which internet plan would you prefer? The 4G plan.
-2G is fine. -Uncle...
4G is the internet speed.
You are talking about GB. Forget 2 GB. 1 GB should do for you.
Kabir, your dad is on Facebook.
He's sent me a friend request.
Brilliant!
What a tune!
Here, 1000 bucks from me.
I belong to the Mughal Family.
Nobody says no to us!
Keep it!
Son, I have not eaten all day. Please lend me 40 bucks.
Come on, one more.
Two more. Properly!
This is our version of Zumba.
It helps his hip injury.
Tell me, in how many working days will Kabir get my request?
It takes just a second!
Everything happens instantly on the internet.
I'll teach you.
Have some sweets.
Let's see what he says.
Look at this! He's rejected your request!
He's even blocked you.
He rejected me?
Now listen to what's right... which may sound a bit wrong.
But it's still right. Come here.
-Which one do you like? -Why?
-This is to relax you. -What are you saying, Beeji?
Not for you, stupid.
For Kabir.
-This one. -Isn't she gorgeous?
Seeing her, Kabir will fell in love!
Auntie, please!
Auntie, we're not going to run away!
Why can't I cry at the right time?
Seher, how could you?
Who splurges rent money on booze?
We're screwed!
Saturday nights do this to me.
I could loot the country on a Saturday.
It's disgusting.
-Take a loan from Baljeet. -Baljeet?
He'll start planning our wedding.
Your life's so full of complications!
How about you taking a loan for a change?
It's an art.
Not everyone has that talent.
Quite right.
Go through hell like me and then you'll learn.
-Anupji is here. -Anupji!
We're done for!
Your wife is kicking us out!
What will we do now?
Leave it to me.
Anupji, your beard! Why did you dye it?
The salt & pepper looked so good on you.
Just like George Clooney.
-Right? -So Clooney!
Go, give it to her.
Anupji!
Sukhi!
It's me! Open up!
Sukhi, open the door!
There you are. Look, I got vegetables for you.
Here.
I kept it for essentials.
Thought you'd have pity on us.
There was an inactive account of a girl.
I saved her photos and created a new account, in the name of Tara.
I use this account to chat.
Beeji has many fake accounts.
Rahul, Reuben, Michael...
Son, use Tara's account to send a request to Kabir.
Why should I become this girl?
Because, a request from a hottie like Tara will never be refused by any boy!
I still don't see why... -I mean... -Don't get confused.
-I mean... -Don't get confused. It's simple.
You need to become Tara so you can chat with Kabir. Simple!
Her face, your words.
Under this guise, you'll be able to talk to your son.
I get it.
At least we will talk. You're right!
Send the request.
-Go on, Beeji. -I'm doing it.
I've set the Facebook account for you. Now enjoy gossiping with Kabir.
Awesome.
He's accepted Tara's friend request. Look.
He blocked his father's request
but the girl's face made him accept it in seconds.
You'd have done the same.
Go on, reply.
I don't know how to do this. You reply.
Okay, tell me.
"I saw your photo... and my heart sang."
LOL? Is he cussing me?
LOL means, "Laugh Out Loud!"
After ages I've heard my child laugh.
LOL, ILY, XOXO, BRB... these are chat codes.
Mug it up and become trendy.
Be romantic or else your kid will run away.
Yet, you sent the request.
If you don't want to be friends...
then unfriend me, block me, cancel me.
-Show her the new stock. -My husband doesn't like that style.
He'll run away!
Show me something else.
He won't run away. In fact, he'll stop doubting you.
Why not show her that one?
Here. The cups have a firm grip.
That reminds me. I'd like a cup of tea. Two cups of tea, son.
You're at a ladies' shop. Mind your language.
I'm out of here!
Jobless by choice! And you?
Me, too!
Ask him where he works.
"Where do you work?"
He says Larsen & Toubro.
Bloody liar!
-Should I write that? -Don't be stupid!
JK, boss.
Who's JK? JK means, "Just Kidding!"
Don't start now.
Now write. "How much do you earn?" Okay.
You sing well.
But for this place, we need something big.
You don't even have a band.
Get in touch when you form one.
All couples here. How will we find our guinea pig?
That's the problem!
-What should we do? -Excuse me.
Hello, respected ma'am. How do you do, respected ma'am?
You girls need company?
We need limited company.
Not unlimited.
Seher, you crazy? He owns a Merc!
So? It must be rented.
Look at his shoes. He's wearing Niki instead of Nike.
You've spent a year with me! Still not learnt to observe?
-Sorry! -When will you learn?
-Hello, sir. How are you? -What's up, brother?
-Shit! Run! -Seher!
-Single! -Seher baby!
Seher baby! Why are you running away? Excuse me, sir!
-Stag entry not allowed, sir. -That's my girlfriend!
-You'll stop me? -Yes, sir.
What are you saying!
Look into my eyes and say, "Stag entry not allowed."
Once more.
Who's the new chick? You don't tell me anything these days.
She's a Facebook friend from Canada.
Wish she was from here.
I have some strange connection with her.
I don't understand all this.
Got the bill?
-Yes. -Shall we go? Sure.
Tell me something. How did this connection happen?
From Old Delhi to Canada... with a chick called Tara!
Shit! Looks like the bill is on us tonight.
You'll only have a soda, right?
Just go a little slow on this Tara/Facebook gig.
-Why? -Because, it happened with me once.
-What? -Her photograph was stunning.
Met her, and "she" was a "he."
-Face of a girl, stuff of a man. -Seriously?
You son of a... Are you mad or what?
You motherfu... Mo... Mo...
Your eyes are innocent. Keep it that way.
Why are you laughing?
His number plate has a 9999 on it. A VIP!
-Did you see his revolver? -It's okay.
By the way, did you know that your dad and Tony are Facebook friends?
I wonder why our parents are on Facebook now.
I don't have a dad. So, my mom is my friend.
Not just on Facebook, even in life.
Mom is no more, and Dad isn't my friend. Neither on Facebook, nor in life.
Tell me once and for all.
Do you intend to do your MBA or not?
I don't want to.
Your phone keeps you busy all day, doesn't it?
Same goes for you these days. Sit down!
You won't be the one to always leave the table.
It's my turn today!
Anees! The food was too spicy today!
I feel like running away.
Why? He is so selfish.
I'm in this godforsaken Old Delhi because of him.
He said, "I want to move to Old Delhi to be with my friends."
He didn't bother about me and my friends.
My band broke up because of him.
That house holds the memories of my mother.
I hate Old Delhi.
If you hate it so much, why don't you just leave?
-Eat your food. -Yeah, I will.
First, read this.
"My Dad wanted me to study Law. So that I could manage his law firm.
But I wanted to go to Canada.
Now that Canada has failed, and I've lost him too...
I feel, maybe I should have done Law."
You really regret not studying Law?
Yes.
You know, Kuljeet...
fathers are never wrong about their children.
Write this too.
"Fathers are very important in this world.
We should value them while we have them."
Bloody blackmailer!
It's not blackmail.
It's called, "creating an impact."
You bet! Now eat.
-Sapna made it specially for you. -Alright.
-The impact is made! -What's he saying?
"It depends on your parents.
My mom was important for me. But my dad..."
Dad?
"Is not important at all."
That's what he said?
You got your musical flair from your mom?
How did you guess?
From what you say, it seems your father's a duffer.
Not a duffer.
Whenever my mom sang, he fell asleep.
Kabir, try to understand your dad.
You only see your own pain...
not your father's loneliness.
Imagine what it feels like to lose a partner!
What happened?
Nothing. It's getting cold. Should I get your shawl?
Okay.
My mom used to sing this song.
Should I send it to you? Listen to it on your headphones.
Now where will I get headphones from?
Yes, Anees Uncle?
Bro, I need your ears' thing. What's it called?
This thing around your neck.
Lend them to me. My speaker's not working.
I have an extra.
-Will this work? -Yes, thank you.
When I look into your eyes I see
Our story
Bits of you and bits of me
Make our story
Our conversations have no Beginning or end
They blend into each other Like nights and days
You begin where I finish and I begin where you finish
That's our story
When I look into your eyes I see
Our story
-Kabir. -Yes, Papa?
Here.
Don't give your headphones to Anees. He doesn't bathe for weeks.
Son, I was thinking... why not start a new band?
It's not that easy.
Son, please do something in your life. I'm worried about you.
And my financial situation is not...
What happened? Nothing happened. Just that...
I am here for you but I won't be there forever.
My dad wrote a poem for my mother.
Can you make a song out of it?
What do you think? Isn't he just like his mother?
Thank God he's not like you.
Stop taunting me all the time. Thank your stars I didn't kill you.
Your wife told me everything on Facebook.
How Ahuja fucked you over in business.
Now you want to fuck me over by reminding me of it?
You rejected my business offer... to partner with that bastard Ahuja.
"I must move to New Delhi. I must get out of here!
It's so crowded here. So dirty! I need to get out!"
Imagine if you had not left!
We would have been together all these years.
Mathur, it's Kabir calling.
Yes, Kabir?
What is your favourite color?
-Why? -I am buying headphones for you.
That's why I asked.
Let me see. Red sounds good.
Okay, Papa.
Kabir is buying red headphones for me.
Don't you think Kabir has changed for good ever since you became Tara?
I think so.
Nobody doubts your talent, Seher.
But this time, it was a bit of a struggle to get an appointment.
She takes a lot of leaves, Mrs. Gulati.
Actually, I wasn't feeling too well. You know, ladies' problem...
When are you returning the 10,000 bucks you owe me?
Very soon.
-Actually, that... -Seher, this is not right.
-What are you doing, Paro? -Sorry!
-Paro! -I am sorry!
"How will the world understand the noise inside me?
Oh, Lord. Silence this noise!"
He's talking about our song on YouTube.
-Please meet my band, please! -What are you doing?
Brother... for us guitar is no more!
If your guitar mix our sax, Delhi on fire!
And you, small timers... this is my musical YouTube star!
I'm Ghannu.
I am Fantu.
Let's see that ass shakin' Let's see the booty movin'
Let's see what you got Oh, baby doll
Oh, baby doll!
You wear the glow of the sun
Oh, my Delhi!
Bruised by many
Yet unclaimed you stand
You stand bright and tall
Such is Delhi
My good old Delhi!
Anees Uncle, you've always lived alone here?
Why? Don't you have a home? Family?
Old Delhi is my only home.
For me, its every lane is filled with memories.
I had an affair with your father's sister.
Aunt Neelu?
It lasted five years... in silence.
Her smile? It would speak!
Wherever her rickshaw went, my Yezdi followed.
"Scram!"
Does dad know?
I didn't let your aunt know. How would he?
Why?
Because I am a Muslim and...
Anees Uncle, you could have eloped.
Don't be crazy.
Why leave my magnificent Old Delhi for a love affair?
What's so special about Old Delhi?
You still have this toy?
Remember how your dad would fly you around the world on this?
Don't be so angry at Old Delhi. New Delhi grew out of it.
What good are these memories?
It's strange... Kabir.
Try experiencing this place through your mother's eyes.
Turn your pain into hope.
You too had wonderful times there, during your childhood.
I don't remember. In any case...
what's in Old Delhi that you miss so much?
I can't tell you. I can show you!
Someday, we'll go there.
Let's see that ass shakin' Let's see that booty movin'
Let's see what you got Oh, baby doll!
Jackie, bro!
Kabir, Sanju, Babaji.
Just turn the Bluetooth on, search and connect. Then play.
It's on! It's working!
It's amazing!
You get the tastiest street food here!
Stop. See that? Your mother's favorite shop.
She loved the samosas here.
-Come, try it. -No.
That is not an option.
Brother, we'll be right back. Come on!
You have to taste it!
-Papa. -What?
I'll be home late.
I have a show tonight.
We've never heard you sing.
He's got his music from his mother.
-She had a beautiful voice. -Really?
Whenever I got back home tired from work her singing would soothe me to sleep.
It was bliss! When will we get to hear your music?
There's a pub called Factory. I'm performing there tonight.
-Please come, all of you. -Sure.
It's my first show with the new band.
Playing for drunkards at a bar?
Doesn't matter. We will be there. Of course, we'll come.
Of course, we'll come. Mittal, Mathur and myself.
After all, it's you performing!
And we'll have a peg each.
I'm here for mom.
Hey, mister! Hello?
-What's the matter? -Who are you?
-Kabir. -Kabir who?
Kabir Mathur. This is my house. Oh! You are Mathur's son?
We have bought this house.
Please leave.
Didn't your father tell you that he sold the house?
-Let's go, Sanju. -What happened?
Your principles, Your rules
Why must I obey at all times?
When I reject your laws
That confine me
It unsettles you
Don't tie me down
Don't restrict me
These rules are a farce So are your laws
Why should I listen to your nonsense?
Oh hypocrite!
You are killing me
With your sweet words
Oh hypocrite!
You are killing me
With your sweet words
Your intentions...
All...
Your promises
Your intentions All your promises
I will reveal the truth
To every one
You deceive, you mislead
Your show of dreams
Selling palaces of lies
Don't play tricks with my emotions
Tomorrow, your apologies won't matter
You'll always be questioned
Then the world will know
You lead a band of dacoits
Oh hypocrite!
You are killing me
With your sweet words
Let go of me!
Don't you understand?
-Bloody asshole! -Tara? Hi!
-That's Tara! -What?
Tara from Facebook! How come you are here?
I can't believe it.
Me too.
Check out that kiss! -What are you looking at? -The kiss, what else?
Bloody motherfucker!
-Run! -Why?
Seher, we're screwed! What's going on? Let's go!
-Tara, why are we running? -Just run!
When did you come back from Canada?
Wait for me!
-Tara, stop! -Come on, hurry!
Get out of the way!
Tara, you are so different on Facebook!
I'm not on Facebook, you prick!
-Drive, mister! -Seher! Don't go!
Asshole, just wait! I'll play you like a fucking guitar!
Asshole, just wait! I'll play you like a fucking guitar! Bastard! Where's the valet? Where's my Audi?
Bastard! Where's the valet? Where's my Audi? Kabir, what a performance!
Liar.
Another lie.
You're always lying!
I think he's figured it out.
Selling the house was my last resort!
I was about to tell you.
All you do is lie. It's a habit with you.
What have I lied about?
Mom's accident? When I got to know, you said it was minor.
So minor that she died? You shirked spending on a good hospital.
That's the truth you never told me. You saved your money!
Now, you sold our house! It was only about the money, right?
How dare you!
Where are you going? I am talking to you, Kabir!
The truth is, I was completely broke.
After your mother's death I was buried in debts.
Then, Ahuja betrayed me. He cheated me.
I was forced to sell our house. I was about to tell you!
-Kabir! -Kabir, what are you doing? Leave me alone!
Don't do this! Boss...
Get the fuck out and never show me your face again!
Just get out!
Good-for-nothing!
A light, brother?
I hope you're not considering suicide.
Don't! It's very painful.
I had tried it once.
It hurt like a bitch.
I'll talk to him and get back to you, Uncle.
-Your dad called again. -I must find that guy who cussed at me.
Leave that for now. Just call your dad.
He's worried sick. He's called me ten times already!
He has many others to look after him.
Can I stay at your house or not?
I know you're upset but don't consider everyone selfish.
-Or a liar! -They are all liars!
-What! -I need to find her! Go to hell!
Tara, why did you lie?
I think it's Kabir's message.
If you're not on Facebook, then who are you?
I know you're in Delhi. Why did you lie?
Did you hear that, Beeji?
Don't give me that look.
My intentions were right. Good, the girl didn't say much...
or I'd be registered a liar, right?
Beeji... this is all a mess!
You meant well but it's gone wrong.
You can't just kiss me and run off!
The lies are getting to him, both yours and Tara's.
But I am Tara! True.
-Oh, God! -What's he saying now?
I'll go to the cyber police. I'll find you, no matter what.
Beeji, it's all got out of hand. Be quiet!
I swear to God... I thought it through, technically.
The girl I found... wasn't from here.
And she has been inactive on Facebook for a year and a half.
Trace her, for heaven's sake.
Do whatever it takes or else we are all done for.
But where, in this huge city?
Let me see her picture.
Let's zoom-in on her picture.
Look. Abu Road, Meerut. Meerut?
That's the board.
Excuse me.
Do you recognize her?
Benny sir!
What's wrong?
-What is it? -Look here. Isn't she the same girl? That lawyer's son's friend.
Isn't she the same girl? That lawyer's son's friend. Yes, she studied here.
Her name is Seher Chowdhary. She had scored a 92%.
Where can we find her? Go to Victoria Park, towards Cantonment.
You'll reach All Saints School.
Ask for Warden Ratan Chowdhary. She's his daughter.
This one! Pause here.
This girl? She's a gold digger, sir.
Pause here.
And that is Baljeet.
That's the VIP! He almost ran us over.
-He's the one? -Yes.
He's the one who cussed at me!
Stay away from him. He's a hothead.
Are you in love with this girl?
Let's go for rehearsals.
Kabir! What's wrong with you?
Our new band is a hit.
Music labels are interested. We're getting gigs. And you--
I want to know why she lied to me.
-Hello. -Hello.
We wanted to meet Seher Chowdhary.
Listen, her antics have troubled us a lot. We have no idea where she is.
Please, leave us alone. Sir, we've come a long way--
I told you once. Please leave.
But, sir... Please leave!
-We must look for her somewhere. -Such an insolent man!
Let's go back to Delhi.
Uncle!
This is the contact number of the salon where Seher works.
She's in Delhi.
When I need to talk to my sister, I reach her on this number.
-The bruise? -It's nothing.
-Sir, let's blow-dry your hair. -Okay.
250 bucks for a shave? 250!
Madam, what's the cost of cleaning the nails?
The luxury manicure is only 1000 bucks. 1000 bucks!
And whatever you're doing to him?
-1000 bucks without the tip. -What!
Seher, before we go broke...
I need to talk to you for just two minutes.
Uncle, have you lost your mind?
Sorry! But what's all this? Disgusting!
Uncle, this is a crime.
You may not be aware... but what you've done is a cyber crime.
You should know.
Child, a father and son chat is led by emotions.
Please try to understand.
Stop trying to get us all sentimental!
I'm going to call the police.
Just wait. Read this chat once. Here's the username and password.
-Why should I read this rubbish? -Exactly!
Get out of here!
We're not here to chat! We've work to do.
Don't think women are weak. That they can be harassed.
I'm telling you, we women have reached the moon.
And we will go beyond. We'll go wherever we like whenever we like.
Gone are the days when you married us off
Gone are the days when you married us off to make babies for all our lives...
Get out!
-Stop bothering us! -Come on, Mittal!
They're troubling us!
"Read the chat," he says!
What's bothering you, Mathur?
I am scared.
So is the Tara inside me.
Both hopes lost at one go.
Type this...
Type this... Address it to Kabir.
"I had my reasons... for not recognizing you."
Attend to your work.
-Did he reply? -Yes.
Tara, you may have your reasons not to recognize me.
But now I have my reasons to find you.
And I will, at any cost!
I saw you as the truth which became a lie.
We have to get this girl on our side.
Your son is in love.
100% in love.
This one-sided love can destroy you.
I have experienced it.
Let's go. Hurry!
Hey! Mind the shop. I'll be back.
I don't want to listen to anything!
Don't you get it? This is where I work!
I'll call security! I'll call the police!
Get out!
Return our aprons!
Madam, please listen to me!
-Give back our aprons. -Please, let me explain.
Spent so much in there. Let us speak to her at least.
-No! -Take your bloody frock!
-I just need two minutes with her! -Mathur! Let's go!
What about the shit on our faces?
We'll wash it at home!
Sharma's got a gig for us.
I need to get back to him. Say something!
Grab the guy in the blue shirt!
-What's your problem smarty pants? -What the fuck!
Yes, sir.
Our band is called Darbaris. You sister-fucker!
No, not you, sir. Yes, sir. Okay.
Kabir? We play in the same band, sir.
How dare you kiss my GF! Interview?
Just like your father!
Always fighting!
Got thrashed? Or thrashed them too?
Seher, please open the door.
I swear, I'm sorry.
I made a mistake! I didn't mean to hit you!
Mistake? I also kissed that guy by mistake!
Who kisses by mistake?
Never happened to me!
You gotta be kidding! How does that even work?
Show me.
-Here, slap me. Slap me! -Let me be!
Slap me! But please forgive me.
What are you doing here? Step aside!
I need to talk to her! Leave!
Seher, I didn't come here to be rude.
Let's party! You'll feel better.
I'll eat your finger!
Don't show me the middle finger!
Don't ever ask me for money again! Showing me the middle finger!
Here's a middle finger for you!
And another one!
You know what you are?
Remember the film where the guy calls his business buddy a disgusting asshole?
That's what you are. Gold digger!
You're the epitome of disgusting!
Guard, open the gate.
I've been waiting forever!
Look who's here!
What do you know? The kiddies are back!
No one touches my car!
If anything happens to my Audi I'll lose control!
Motherfucker!
I'll knock your sister up!
Bloody motherfucker!
Put the blanket over him!
Help! Mommy!
That's Baljeet!
And that guy whose song is trending.
Hit that swine one more time! A couple more!
Isn't this blackmail?
First, I need the money. And second...
Uncle, look... who would do this for free going out of their way?
who would do this for free going out of their way?
-How much? -Just 50 grand for one meeting.
What! 50 grand for nothing?
Nothing? I read the entire chat.
It's a royal mess!
Okay, deal.
-But you must clean up the mess. -Don't worry.
Our girl here is an expert in these matters.
Cash or cheque?
We don't want to end up paying tax.
-Cash! -What!
Okay, we'll pay you tomorrow.
The thing is... our singer is unwell.
We lost another gig.
Guys, we are musicians not criminals.
Why are we busy bashing people up? Everything's fair in friendship.
Son, anger is a bad thing.
It affects the melody.
Yeah.
Babaji, I've found my melody.
Metro Barakhamba?
That Baljeet has gone nuts!
May I call you tomorrow?
I'll confirm and let you know. Speak up.
-Shit! Run! -But...
-Kabir, what's going on? -Don't stop! Hurry up!
Where are we going?
-Kabir! -Where are you...
Hurry up!
What happened?
-What's going on? -Excuse me!
What's your problem!
Shut up and come with me!
Who the hell are we running from?
-Come, come! -Where?
Come!
Who are we running from?
Kabir? Kabir!
Bye, Tara!
Kabir!
Now you know how I felt that day when you took me for a spin and vanished.
-Laughing at me, aren't you? -This brat!
Who? -Kabir! -Why?
-Kabir! -Why?
He says, "Now you know how I felt that day... when you took me for a spin and vanished."
This guy is fast.
Paro!
Girl, I don't like where this is going.
-Type this. -What?
"Tomorrow. Your call, time and place."
Get set for round three.
This time I'll wear sneakers.
So why did you say you're not on Facebook?
I didn't want to meet you.
But here I am. I lied.
And... why didn't you want to meet?
I keep my social media and real life apart.
Who is that guy?
The one you beat up under the blanket?
We saw it.
It was right outside our house.
You really gave it to him.
He was a boyfriend type.
You've broken up?
-That asshole hit me. -Really?
Look!
I kissed you that night. He got jealous.
Then you shouldn't have. He was being clingy, my god!
"Love you, baby! I wanted to piss him off.
Want to ask anything else?
I did what you suggested.
-What? -I left my house.
-Can I say something? -Go ahead.
Why not go back to your father?
We complicate things.
Just talk it out. It's that simple.
This causes more complications, Kabir.
You are absolutely right!
I'm going to tell my father straight out that I don't intend to marry right now.
Shall we go? Come on.
We won't meet anymore.
Just the Facebook Tara.
But I find the real Tara more interesting.
Run!
Tara? Tara!
What's this? I like these girls. Both of them.
-Shit! Baljeet! -Was that baby?
I have a black-eye but why can't you see?
Dude, Kabir is a cool guy.
He's different. Don't talk nonsense.
Bitch! I've never seen you pick up the bill for any other guy!
-Right? -Hey!
-For you! -No, thanks!
It's your father's poem. I turned it into a song.
Could you please play this?
Let me protect you
From the world
Come closer
Let me make you
Feel special
Come closer
I couldn't bear
To see you cry
Let me steal away every tear
That ever came to your eye
Let me protect you
From the world
Come closer
Please stop the song.
Why? It's so good.
Yes, Uncle.
Uncle this is Seher, not Tara.
Yes, we met.
No, nothing major.
Uncle, I told him we won't meet again.
If we meet by accident, I'll handle it.
Good that she agreed to play along.
Thank God that I don't lead this double life.
Playing Tara was tough.
Tea for three.
Not me. Make it two. Read this. I don't have my glasses.
Who is it from? Kabir.
Tara, your Facebook person pales compared to the real Tara.
We must meet again.
-I propose round four. -Damn!
That's called modern romance.
Round four, no less!
I got it! I'll pay her some more.
She can pretend to be in love and bring Kabir home by Diwali.
First, get him back to his music.
Second, get him back home by Diwali.
He's my only son.
But... how can one pretend to be in love?
You can, I know.
Yes, Baljeet.
I owe you 25 grand, not 27.
Fine, do the math again.
Can you give me something upfront?
The rest when it's done? Of course.
Take ten grand for now.
The rest, when the job is done.
But I don't know if I can pull this off.
I have faith in you.
So, Prankster? Yeah.
The food here is the best.
You sing so well! I could fall in love.
Go ahead, fall in love.
Who's stopping you?
You need balls to fall in love. I don't have them.
I'm just a serial flirt.
So, you're getting married? My father wants me to, but...
I got back from Canada a couple of years ago.
Is this tattoo permanent? Yes, with a heart-wrenching story.
Which I'm not telling.
Why the kiss?
First, to show that I have the balls. Second, to piss someone off.
-Who? -Baljeet.
Tara, stop running away.
-Tell him the truth. -Let go!
Motherfucker!
I'll bust your balls! How dare you date him while I'm around?
You and I are completely different!
What's this cozy twosome?
It was never you. I fell for your fancy car.
You're lying!
You'll find a great girl one day. Understood?
-He didn't! Listen, Seher.
No, you listen!
You hit a woman again and I'll smash your face!
I'll learn to play the guitar! What else? You'll teach me the guitar, you bastard!
I can't believe your guitar beat my high-speed Audi.
I never saw it coming.
Brother, that's the problem.
It is what's inside that is important.
Not the biceps or the fancy cars.
Come here.
It's really very simple.
Keep your heart out and your money in...
Uncle, I'll call you later.
You're like a brother to me.
Let me know if you ever need anything.
You didn't need to.
Seher...
Seher...
Don't know why
The lines on your palms Are now etched on mine
The words on my lips Are always about you
Don't know why
What is this? Why is this? Surely you too think so
Why are my mornings Filled with your nights
If I don't see you, I feel In some way, incomplete
And my life is meaningless
Meaningless!
Meaningless!
Meaningless!
Don't know why
The lines on your palms Are now etched on mine
The words on my lips Are always about you
Don't know why
I am losing myself
Becoming like others
I get tangled
In meaningless conversations
I feel empty
As I must seem to others
In some way, incomplete
Meaningless!
Meaningless!
Listen, I am curating a music festival.
I really want you guys to perform there. Okay?
I get lost in meaningless conversations
Even my dreams seem empty
When you're not around
I get lost in meaningless conversations
Even my dreams seem empty
When you're not around
Made a wish?
For my family.
Diwali is round the corner.
I really miss my family.
Diwali is always special.
The whole family together!
Fireworks and mom's food.
Papa?
It's... Seher, Papa.
How are you?
I'm fine, too.
Papa, I was thinking of coming home for Diwali.
Okay, Papa.
CHIRAG.
Ready to tell me the heart wrenching story?
This is Chirag.
I loved him, stole money from my parents for him. Paid his fees.
What did I get in return? Betrayal.
He took me for a ride and dumped me in a jiffy.
Then he ran away to Canada.
Is that why you left Meerut?
Kabir, I was pregnant.
I had no option but to run away.
Big tummy in a small town? Without marriage, no way!
I was betrayed by everyone around me.
Seen the Yamuna River bridge, by the bus stand?
I stood there, alone. Suicide did cross my mind.
I felt disgusted with myself.
Fought and reasoned with myself.
Then I went to a random clinic.
Gathered some courage...
and got an abortion.
It could have ruined my parents.
Discipline is all my father knows.
He's a simple man.
Should we go to Meerut for Diwali? I'll come with you.
No. Everyone...
I called dad. Told him I want to come.
He said they won't be home.
He doesn't want me to return, Kabir.
Let's go to Old Delhi this Diwali. We'll celebrate with dad.
Let's celebrate together.
Wishing everyone a very auspicious Diwali!
-Welcome! -Happy Diwali!
Come, Dheela!
Let's go.
Happy Diwali. God bless you.
Go, get your blessings first.
Wait... -How old are you? -I am 62.
You are my age and you're touching my feet?
-Yes. -Keep moving!
-Papa, this is Tara. -Hello, Uncle.
-Papa, this is Tara. -Hello, Uncle. I've got you a kurta.
Oh, lovely!
With your own money?
I am earning now, Papa. Our band is quite popular.
Let me just quickly put this on. Come, let's go inside.
Anees Uncle...
this is for you. A kurta.
Thank you! Bless you!
Kabir got this beautiful silk kurta for me.
Isn't it lovely?
Kabir's got it for me. Cheers to that!
I love seeing you eat Rajma Chawal with your hands.
Now tell me about your band. It's going great, Papa.
What's this?
You're so beautiful. Why this weird haircut?
It looks good.
Yeah. It's a style.
-No way! -Yeah, exactly.
Come for our gig when you're free.
Yes, of course!
Guys, help yourselves...
I'll be back, Papa.
What a firecracker!
Bye, Papa. I'll keep visiting.
Coming upstairs?
Paro?
She's visiting her parents for Diwali.
Some other day.
Anup, get your ass inside!
If I don't kiss you today I'll regret it all my life.
-Sit! -You sit, Uncle.
Which coffee should I order for you?
We'll do all that later.
I had asked you for a small favour. But you didn't deliver.
What? Kabir never came back.
I mean, not for good.
You're free to go now. Let's end this drama.
It's not a drama anymore. That's what I need to tell you.
How amazing!
I asked you to put up an act. You made it real.
I mean... you and Kabir are completely different.
Please go your separate ways.
But we love each other. Please try and understand.
How much more money do you need? Oh, yes! I forgot your Diwali bonus!
Now the deal's over.
I was about to return all your money.
You're an extremely fast girl.
Look at your appearance!
Kabir is a straight-forward guy. Don't be a nuisance.
Got it?
"Let me protect you from the world, come closer.
Let me make you feel special, come closer.
I couldn't bear to see you cry...
help me steal away every tear that came to your eye."
You wrote this for your wife?
I don't believe you're capable of love.
Tara!
-Why aren't you answering my calls? -Because I don't want to.
What do you mean?
I don't want to talk to you, Kabir! Go away!
-Tara, what happened? -I said go!
-What happened? -Go!
Okay.
You want to hear the truth?
I am bored of you.
You know that's how I am!
Now, please go!
God knows what you're hiding this time!
Kabir!
You know how easy it was?
I went home and told my father that I don't want to get married.
And he agreed.
We complicate our lives unnecessarily! It's actually so simple.
Don't cry, child.
Come on, be brave.
I don't understand anymore.
Let's just pretend that Tara never existed!
You found her on Facebook, right? Shut it down.
To hell with Tara! Concentrate on your music.
Move on. Live your life, son.
Good boy. Come on, don't cry.
Son, love is a gift from God!
The world's changing. So should you.
-Beeji, you won't understand. -Son, you try and understand.
Don't interfere in my family matters!
Have you lost your mind?
Behave yourself! Beeji, a cup of tea?
And you guys?
Shut the fuck up! Who do you think you are?
Selfish bastard! You've always been so!
You think only we should maintain friendship?
And you can offer us tea whenever you like?
I kept saying, "Never mind! It's okay!"
Just to avoid confrontation.
And you...
You will sit around and offer us tea? You know what?
Drink that bloody tea by yourself.
Order some snacks to go with your tea.
Everyone is fast for you!
Only you and your son are slow in the whole world?
Why are you so frustrated?
-Am I the frustrated one or you? -Shut up!
That girl took control of your son. That's why you got jealous!
How did she achieve what you couldn't as his father?
Shut up!
You begged me to do business with you.
Ever had a look in the mirror?
The truth is that I did not want to do business with you. That's why I declined.
So, who is frustrated? You or me?
Talking nonsense!
That's it.
I'm done with you.
Go fuck yourself!
Let's leave, Beeji. It's time for your TV soap.
Let's go.
They don't even have a TV.
Can't expect them to have feelings, can we?
Seher, working so late? Let's leave.
I need to make money, Paro.
Borrowed money is poison.
Seher...
I am with you...
Always by your side
What's happened to your leader?
Tell Kabir to call me urgently.
In sunlight
In rain
In victory
In pain
In everything that you ever think Or do
Somewhere between Knowing and feeling
Somewhere between Knowing and feeling I am with you
What's this? The money I owe you.
Really?
I had called you disgusting, right?
You know, you are not even the "D" of disgusting.
Seher...
I finished the beginner's guitar lessons.
This is what's disgusting!
Anupji, Auntie... I can't afford living here.
I'm moving to a hostel. Don't worry.
Sanju?
Back in time. I was about to leave.
-What happened? -Uncle, please talk to Kabir.
The music festival called again. They're getting impatient. Might cancel the show.
Kabir is unable to sing.
I don't know what to do.
I'll talk to him.
Boss!
-Papa! -Boss!
My chest is hurting!
-Anees Uncle! -Is this a heart attack?
Kuljeet Uncle!
Kuljeet!
Is he okay, Doctor?
How is he?
He's okay now, resting.
-Heart attack? -Yes.
You brought him in time.
Anger affects health. He should cool down.
Don't worry about the money.
It's no problem.
You guys should go. Come tomorrow. Okay?
-Go in. -You can go in, son.
Go see your dad.
Don't talk too much.
What's this, Papa?
Come back home.
Why don't you look after yourself?
Please don't be so stubborn.
You don't let anyone take care of you.
Even mom's not with us now.
Don't cry, my child.
I'll be fine, my son.
Don't worry.
You get yourself together.
Stop crying now.
I'm sorry to be this way.
All I know is that I love you, Papa.
Beyond everything else!
Kabir...
let your father rest now.
You need some rest too.
Let me stay a little longer.
Sorry, but this is the ICU.
Come back during the visiting hours.
Don't worry, I'll be here.
God bless.
-I need to return this money. -Tara?
Hold on!
Let's go!
-Where are you going? -Go away!
-Listen! -Leave me alone!
-What was she doing here? -Nothing.
-What are you hiding there? -Nothing. -What is it? -It's nothing!
-What's this? -It's nothing.
-What's this? -Kabir, your father really loves you.
You're such a drama queen. I'll lose my medical license because of you.
I've made a huge mistake.
-What now? -I realized how much my son loves me. You saw how he wept and held on to me?
Let's end this drama. I'm out of here!
Easy. Careful!
Let me out! Bring me my clothes.
Mathur, at least change your clothes. You can't walk out like this.
I can't let that girl leave! Kabir will be shattered.
-It's really cold outside. -Doesn't matter.
Thank you, madam, for the jersey... Sir?
-That's my jersey! -I'll return it.
Mathur, hang on! I'll go with you.
Shut up, Dheela!
Rickshaw!
-No way! -Rickshaw!
I don't want to hear anything! I'm sick of his lies!
-Enough! -Kabir, please!
-Boss? -What happened?
-What happened? -To hell with you all! Kabir, listen!
-Boss! -I was just pretending!
-You're unwell! -Didn't he have a heart attack?
It was no heart attack. But he could get one now.
Boss, I made a mistake. I told him about the whole Tara thing.
He found out about the deal, we're screwed!
-Kabir, stop! -Kabir!
What happened?
He must have gone to Seher, I mean, Tara.
This way or that way? Have you seen Kabir?
No, Uncle, but I tried calling Seher! She's not answering my calls.
She's moved to a girl's hostel.
-Take us over there. -Let's go.
Out of the way!
Anees! Where is Mittal?
-No idea. -Go fetch him.
-How much money did you lose? -Four.
Four million?
Kabir! What's the matter? Wait, son!
Mathur's son is such a...
-Mittal! -Yes?
Kabir has run away!
-He just went this way -What are you saying!
It all started with Mathur's heart attack.
Let's rush to that hostel. Some girl's hostel, ladies' hostel!
Let's go!
Do you know the way?
Call Kuljeet.
Watchman!
-Watchman! -Open up!
Anyone there? Open the gate!
We have to meet Seher Chowdhary urgently.
Sir, it's past visiting hours.
What do you mean?
Open!
There are cameras everywhere. I'll lose my job!
-Look! -Madam's here!
Let's go in.
Uncle, no!
My job is at risk!
Wait! You can't just barge in! It's a girl's hostel.
We need to see Seher Chowdhary urgently! It's not the visiting hours!
We don't have time!
I'm a heart patient! I...
Seher Chowdhary, they're calling you urgently.
She's here.
-Uncle? -Seher!
First, I am so sorry for everything. What I did was horrible.
Kabir's missing. Do you know where he is?
I have no clue.
She doesn't know.
-Think, Seher. -Wait a second.
He installed an app, Find a Friend, on my phone.
Here. Dwarka Metro Station!
Let's get moving!
Let's go!
Where is he?
I don't know. I've lost the network.
No network?
Let's split up. There are three platforms.
You on 1. Myself on 2. You on 3.
Okay?
You look after Beeji.
Beeji, let's wait here.
Uncle, there!
Go talk to him.
Please, don't run. Stop running.
Not from me or yourself.
Sit down.
I don't want to talk to you.
Please, tell me something new.
Like, "I have so much to tell you."
Then even I'll be surprised for a change.
Your mom met with an accident.
She told me it was minor and that I shouldn't tell you.
Because you had your final year exams. So, better not...
She threw up the whole night.
By morning, she was gone.
It was your mother who lied to me. And you made me the liar!
I never told you about the house because...
sometimes you lack the courage to share your failure with your children.
I tried so many times but I couldn't do so.
We both lost the person who had kept us together.
What she left behind was...
your anger, your loneliness, bitterness...
When I ran out of all options...
I created Tara's profile to chat with you.
I got left behind, son.
You had moved a long way.
I made a mistake, son.
A huge mistake.
Behind all this is my love.
I was just unable to tell you so.
Because I never learned to express love with words.
I don't know how...
It was my mistake.
-There they are! -What a sight!
Congratulations!
God bless you, my child.
-Now you can talk to us, right? -Where is Seher?
She took the last train and left this message for you.
What does it say?
I've brought Kabir back home, forever.
It took me a while to understand Seher...
but she is your truth. Don't lose her.
Go get her. Go.
-Go on! -Go on, son!
-Godspeed, son! -Go, Kabir!
-Go! -Be careful!
I'm Kabir.
This is your last chance. Tell me your truth.

[woman] Sky.
Clouds.
[girl] D...
D... Dog!
Dog? Where's the dog? [girl] Over there.
Didn't you see it?
No.
What kind of dog was it?
Small dog.
Interesting.
E for...
elephant!
[girl] Elephant? Where?
Yeah. What, did you miss it?
Hey, sweetie. Don't pick at your scab. Come on.
I was just checking. Did you make that hole?
It was already like that.
It'll leave a scar.
I wouldn't even have a scab if Lily Stevens didn't push me.
Lily Stevens wouldn't have pushed you if you hadn't thrown chalk at her.
She was making faces at me.
[woman] We don't hurt people.
Not ever. She deserved to be hurt.
[gasps] No, she didn't.
Clara, no one deserves to be hurt,
no one.
Okay?
Come on.
[woman] All good? [Clara] Yeah.
[radio host] I got to meet TJ. He's a nice, nice gentleman.
[radio host] I got to meet TJ. He's a nice, nice gentleman. Please go in to TJ's and get yourselves some waffles there.
So that is on the list, and I'm gonna put it down as number two
because last--
[Tony Robbins on podcast] We grow or we die.
So, we're unaware that we use events as a trigger to get home back to the patterns we know
to get home back to the patterns we know even if it's uncomfortable.
So, if you identify where you live,
emotionally, the patterns that are limiting you,
-the second piece is find the antidote. -[phone dings] -Shit. -[Robbins] We all will face,
-Shit. -[Robbins] We all will face,
multiple times in our life, extreme stress.
The difference in peoples' lives is not what we face,
it's what we do with what we face.
Life gives us these events, these, quote, "horrific events,"
because there's an area of our life that has to grow.
You can take yourself from a place
where in the face of absolute total tragedy, you triumph...
[softly] You've gotta be kidding me.
Oh, shit.
[Clara, sleepily] Mommy...
why did we stop?
Oh, great.
Where are we, Mommy?
Somewhere, sweetie.
[woman] You know, Poppy taught me how to change a tire.
One day I'll teach you.
In the meantime, you should probably come over here and...
get a head start and pay attention.
[Clara] Nah, that's boring.
Yeah, suit yourself.
Maybe you can help by getting Mommy her coffee.
-[Clara] Mommy... -[sighs] Oh, God.
[Clara] When we get to Oklahoma, can we...
Clara?
Clara?
-Show me! -Mommy, it bit me!
Let me see, Clara.
Oh, God. Okay. It's okay, sweetie.
It's okay. It's okay.
Come on, come on. Oh, it's okay. Clara? Clara?
Oh, it's okay. Clara? Clara? Come on, baby.
Oh, sweetie.
Hold on, sweetie.
[woman] Hello?
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Hello?
Come on, stay with me, baby, okay?
Just stay with me, baby. Stay with me.
Oh, God. Come on, come on.
I'm so sorry for barging in.
My little girl, she got bitten by a snake,
and I really need your help.
I got a flat tire, and I can't get a signal.
She's really burning up. I don't know what to do.
You're in luck, darlin'.
I've worked on many a bite out here. Let me help her.
Oh, thank God.
-Oh, she's going blue. She's going blue! -Here, let me.
-Oh, she's going blue. She's going blue! -Here, let me. Please help her!
What can you do? The nearest town's Tulia.
You'll find a hospital there.
You best get that tire sorted out.
Come on, don't just stand there, honey. Time's a-wasting.
We'll discuss payment later.
It's okay, sweetie.
Mommy's here.
Clara?
Clara.
Mommy...
[softly] Okay. Come on, sweetie.
[man] We'll keep her in for the day, monitor her condition,
but trust me, if a five-year-old was bitten by a rattlesnake...
[chuckles] you'd know it.
From the looks, it's just exhaustion, mild dehydration.
You should've seen her. She was burning up, she wasn't breathing.
She turned blue, for Christ sakes.
[doctor] Were you feeling out of sorts at all during the drive?
[woman] No.
-[doctor] Medication? You taking anything? -[woman] Nothing, no.
Listen, Phoenix to Oklahoma can be a long haul.
Yeah, well, I'm not a very good flier, so driving was the lesser of two evils.
[doctor] Were you feeling, uh...
Is this necessary?
...apprehensive or... stressed before the drive?
No. Uh, yes, I guess.
It's been pretty crazy. Um...
We're starting over, and the move's been a lot on Clara.
You're a single mother?
Yes.
[doctor] Slightly elevated. Not surprising, but nothing alarming.
Look, I know this sounds crazy.
But there has to be some kind of explanation.
I mean, that old woman, maybe she had...
I don't know, like an ancient remedy on her shelf or something.
I'm just... I'm just telling you what happened.
[doctor] Your daughter's gonna be fine. She just needs to rest.
You need to do the same.
Get some sleep.
[man] That's all it is. God's will.
[sobs] I know.
[man] Such a pretty little thing.
To think we almost lost her.
You really are lucky. Things could have ended much differently.
You are?
I'm here to talk about your payment, Ms. Ridgeway.
Oh. Why don't you pull up a chair?
So, we have insurance, my daughter and I, both.
We're both covered.
Oh, I'm not talking about your hospital debt.
I'm talking about the other debt.
The one you now owe.
What was done for your daughter doesn't come cheap.
Her little soul was spared.
And now you owe one in return.
I'm sorry, I thought you said soul.
Ms. Ridgeway, you don't have long to pay your debt.
You only have until sunset, which is...
now only...
seven hours away.
The soul you take can be any one of your choosing,
but it must be human.
And it must be paid in full and on time.
Okay, I...
don't really understand what's going on.
I don't know who you are. I think I'm gonna call security.
I would like you to leave the room, leave my daughter alone.
Failure to meet your debt, Ms. Ridgeway,
will result in your daughter's condition returning to what it was.
I'd like you to leave now.
Let me, uh, remind you of what that'd look like.
Clara? Clara?
-Sweetie? -She will suffer...
What've you done to her?
...before she succumbs to the snake venom...
working its way through her tiny body.
No, please, stop it.
She will die, Ms. Ridgeway, that I can assure you.
Make it stop! Fucking get out of here! Get out!
Help! Someone come in here, now!
Please, somebody help me!
[man] Seven hours, Ms. Ridgeway.
You best get a move on.
[woman] I need help! In here!
Quick, please!
Okay, I need you to call-- -[female nurse] Did something happen here? -[alarm stops]
-Who do you want us to call? -Miss?
Miss?
Miss?
-[male nurse] Should I call security? -No, no, no, no! No, don't.
-[male nurse] Should I call security? -No, no, no, no! No, don't. That won't be necessary.
[female nurse] Are you okay?
[woman] I've been up since before dawn, driving.
Maybe I need to check into the motel across the road.
[female nurse] That's probably for the best. We'll keep an eye on her for you.
[woman] Okay, I'll just say goodbye to her.
[softly] Oh, my God.
[cries] I don't know what's going on, Clara.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
This is insane.
I just want you to be okay.
[operator] 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
Hello?
9-1-1, what's your emergency?
Great.
[yells] I'm fine!
I'm fine, I don't need any help!
She's gonna die, Katrina!
Only one way to save her! Stay away from me.
There's nowhere to run!
[cries] You stay away from me!
Fuck off!
[news reporter] This is the diner in Tulia, Texas
where 47-year-old lawyer Donald Covington was fatally stabbed in the chest
by 32-year-old school teacher Michael James Warner just before sunset.
Witnesses say Warner kept repeating, in a bizarre manner,
"A soul for a soul," as he attacked Covington.
Warner is currently in cu--
[Katrina] "The difference is not what we face,
it's what we choose to do when we face it." "The difference is not what we face,
it's what we choose to do when we face it."
Thank you.
Hey, um...
I'm so sorry... about before.
That... that was so nosy of me.
I shouldn't have just been peering into your room like that.
It's fine.
No, I just wanted to offer my condolences.
He's not gone yet.
Oh, no. Uh... Of course not.
-You wanna sit? -Oh, sure, sure.
Such a strange thing...
waiting for your daddy to die.
Anyway, I'm sorry. What brings you here?
my daughter, she got sunstroke.
We've been driving all day, and... she's not feeling too well.
[woman] How's she doing? She's fine. Um...
Doctor thinks she just needs some rest.
Um, I'm Loraine.
Susan.
Anyway, um, it was nice chatting with you.
I hope you and your little one get out of here soon.
Well, uh, actually she's out for the count right now
and I am going stir-crazy in that silence all by myself.
So I was wondering if maybe, uh, I could...
uh, keep you company.
[Loraine] With Daddy?
[Loraine] Apparently, they can hear you.
The nurse described it kind of like a...
like a two-way mirror or...
Or was it a one-way mirror?
Either way, he won't be waking up.
But I'm still here, Daddy.
You okay, Susan?
He seems to be at peace.
Yeah.
-[cell phone vibrates] -Oh, shoot.
Hey, y'all here?
B-7. No, it's at the, um...
All right, just wait there, I'm coming.
Leave it to my sister to get lost in a hospital this small.
I gotta go grab 'em.
I should go get Clara.
-[Loraine] Thank you, Susan. -Sure.
[whispers] I have to do this, I have to do this.
I have to do this, I have to do this, I have to do this, I have to do this.
Loraine...
who is this?
I was just using the, um, bathroom.
[man] Frank?
Jesus Christ, lady!
Are you all right?
-Wh... What the hell happened? -Stay away from me.
[driver] What were you thinking?
I almost ended you!
Is everything okay?
Hey, you don't... You don't look all right.
Look, you want me to call someone?
Let...
You fucking serious?
Hey!
Fucking bath salts, man.
-That one's on the house. -[door opens]
â™ª I fall to pieces... â™ª [bartender] Well, hell, Abbie.
What, you gonna put this down to another roller derby injury, huh?
It's a heck of a sport you chose there. Just give me a beer, Francine.
Please?
Definition of insanity
is doing the same thing and expecting a different result.
[Abbie]  So they say.
I know you?
Come on. Enough's enough.
Let me stay, please, just a little while.
Get up off that stool, Abbie. [Francine] Billy, just let her finish her damn beer.
This don't concern you, Francine, unless, of course, you want it to.
[Francine] Can't have y'all getting into it here.
-Abbie... -All right.
All right.
Let's go.
[Billy] Hold up.
Apologize to Francine for coming in here and making a scene,
upsetting this nice customer.
Go on.
Sorry.
Just get out of here, both of y'all.
Go on, get!
Place has gone to shit anyways.
[Francine] Mm-hmm. Go on.
Go, get out!
-[door closes] -Ain't they a pair?
They live near here?
[Francine] Oh, yeah, Tulia's finest.
Only a matter of time before she ends up in the obituaries.
Some people are just beyond help.
Get off...
[Billy] Why you always gotta make a scene?
Get in that fucking truck.
Get in the truck! I'm not standing here in the goddamn street!
Come on. Get in!
12 Amarosa. 12 Amarosa.
12 Amarosa.
[man] Well, go on. It ain't gonna bite you.
Lightweight, easily concealable,
but most important: accurate.
Shoots a maximum of 16 rounds through a flush-fitted magazine.
I'll do you two boxes for the price of one.
You ever, uh, fire one of those, darlin'? I'll take it.
All right.
I'm just gonna need to see your license. You're a Texas resident, I take it.
No.
Well, I'm afraid I can't be letting you purchase a firearm.
Residents of Texas only. Look...
my daughter and I, we were, uh...
attacked on the road.
I feel like I need protection. And I don't know what you can do, but maybe you could just...
And I don't know what you can do, but maybe you could just... just turn a blind eye, or... I don't...
When did it get to be like this?
When did the open roads of this great country of ours revert to such savagery?
It's not right, not one bit.
Where's your little one?
In the hospital.
Jesus. What...?
I'm sorry, I can't help you, but...
this man can.
His name's Charlie. Lives here in Tulia. You can find him here.
It's a cash-only transaction.
I guess you'd call him a private dealer.
[man, over speaker] What you want?
Hi. Earl, uh, sent me.
Hi. Earl, uh, sent me. He said he'd vouch for me. Are you Charlie?
[Charlie] Lose the cap.
Okay, Katrina Ridgeway.
I'm gonna have to do a quick body check.
Is that really necessary?
Okay.
-You want me to fix you up some tea? -No, thank you.
More of a coffee drinker, huh?
I guess.
My wife, Tracy, she'd stock the cupboard
full of a whole variety of exotic flavors.
Hibiscus was her favorite.
-So, can we-- -You sure you don't wanna try some?
It's no trouble. I'm sure.
[stammers] I... I've gotta go.
Tracy is no longer with us.
She took the barrel of a Glock, identical to the one that you're buying...
and put it in her mouth.
Okay, I am so sorry...
so sorry to hear about your wife, but I've gotta get going.
Listen to me, just...
rabbiting on.
Yeah, she's... She's all yours.
The piece, that is.
The rounds are another 50.
I... think I've got 40.
I mean, I can rustle up the other ten, but I've gotta go.
[sighs] I ain't gonna deprive a woman of carrying a piece.
Now, what kind of a man would I be?
I'll let the ten slide.
Thank you, thank you.
You ever handle one of them before?
'Cause if you need some pointers...
I offer that for free.
No, I'm, uh...
Who's the unlucky son of a bitch?
What?
They got it coming?
You out to end someone. I can see it in your eyes, plain as day.
So, I wanna know.
I wanna know, Katrina Ridgeway...
that you're sure...
that they got it coming.
[man over video] Hi, it's me again, Mr. Glock.
Uh, I thought today, uh, one of the Glocks  I've not demonstrated
or talked about, is the good old reliable Glock 19.
It's a magazine full of bullets in it,
and it also has one in the chamber.
I'll quickly check that.
Shit. The towels are all wet.
[Abbie] Oh, I put them in before work. They're in the drier.
-[Billy] I'll get 'em. -[Abbie] You sure?
[Billy] Can't have my girl drying off with no wet towel.
Here.
[Billy] We gotta leave at 7:00. [Abbie] Okay.
[Billy] We'll eat there? [Abbie] Sure.
Come here.
You know...
You haven't finished your punishment yet.
[Abbie] I'm not feeling so good. Maybe we can rain check?
You already made a fool of me once today.
[Abbie, stammering] Please...
[Billy] Without order, what are we? [Abbie] Okay. Okay.
[Abbie] Okay. Okay. [Billy] What would we be?
[groans in pain] Animals.
[softly] Animals.
You don't wanna be an animal.
[Abbie] No.
Half-hour should do it. Come on.
I said come on!
but Williams was able to score.
The fuck you doing? Get your stupid ass back up there!
What the fuck?
The fuck are you?
[Katrina, stammering] Take the keys.
-Slowly. -Okay.
Nice and slow.
[Katrina, breathing heavily] Okay, um...
Put the beer down.
-[Billy] Okay, I'm putting it down. -Okay.
Slowly.
-Okay. -Beer's down.
Okay. Get on the floor.
You get down.
Okay. You stay there. Don't move, okay?
Thank you.
Okay, get up. Get up.
-If you want the truck-- -Just get up!
I want you to tell me...
how to get to the garage. Can we get to the garage from the house?
-Yeah? -Mm-hmm. Okay.
You're gonna show me.
[Katrina] Turn on the light.
Okay. Let's go, down.
We're going for a drive.
I want you to follow my directions.
I'm gonna take you somewhere.
Okay? You just listen to what I tell you.
So, get in the car.
Just get in.
Just... Just look ahead.
Hey, uh, left at the T-junction.
-Where are we going? -Just make a left.
Pull over.
Kill the engine.
Toss the keys back here slowly.
Please...
Please...
Just tell me what you want.
I can get you money.
I can get you anything you want. Please, just tell me.
Get out of the truck.
No. 'Cause if I do, you'll shoot me.
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. Get out of the truck.
[tearfully] Why are you gonna kill me?
Just tell me what I've done so I know, please.
Please don't kill me.
-Stop crying. -Please.
-I don't wanna die! -Stop... Stop crying.
I can't help it because you're gonna kill me.
Look, I need you to hold yourself together
and get out of the fucking truck, okay? You hear me?
Please, because, look, I know I've done some fucked up things in this lifetime.
Okay, I know I have.
But please, if you tell me, I can fix it, I promise.
Please, 'cause I don't wanna die!
Okay, listen to me, you piece of shit! I just want your fucking truck.
No, no, no, no, no.
[panting] Oh, God!
[yells] Where are you, you piece of sh...
-[woman, in Australian accent] Well... -[shutter clicks]
you gave it your best shot, Kat.
Stay there. That's good. Hold that.
Nice.
Please.
There has to be another way to put this right.
She's just a child.
Please, there has to be...
some other way.
Sorry, Kat.
You know what you gotta do.
Promise me...
she'll be all right.
You promise me...
if I do this...
it'll be over...
and you'll leave her alone.
Fair's fair.
Clara...
I want you to know that I love you so, so, so much...
from the bottom of my heart.
[sniffles] And...
none of this is gonna makes sense because it doesn't make any sense.
But I want you to know that I didn't want to leave you.
And I had to do... I had to do...
I had to do what I had to do to keep you safe.
I want you to remember me.
And keep me close to your heart as best as you can.
And, uh, don't let me fade.
I love you so much.
I love you so, so, so much, sweetie.
[Clara, whispering] Mommy.
Come on, you crazy bitch!
Give me them fucking keys.
Now what, huh?
You wanna fucking play?
The fuck you doing?
What the fuck?
Please, no.
Please, just stop...
Why are you doing this?
Please stop. Please...
Why?
Why are you doing this?
Why?
Shh. [softly] It's all right.
It'll all be over soon.
You're crazy, you fucking bitch.
You're gonna burn in hell for this.
You're gonna fucking burn, you fucking bitch.
You're gonna burn in hell for this! You'll burn!
We'll see.
Hello? [doctor] Hello, Ms. Ridgeway?
Speaking.
This is Dr. Hayes. I'm calling about your daughter Clara.
I've been trying you for around an hour now.
Tell me. Sorry?
How is she?
She's fine. She's up, ready to go. She's wondering where you are. [chuckles]
So am I, for that matter.
Tell her I'm on my way. I'll be there soon.
Okay, will do. I'll make sure she gets something to eat.
Thank you.
-[Clara] Mommy! -Hey, sweetie.
[Clara] They gave me red jello and ice cream.
Ooh, they did, sweetie? Yeah, and spaghetti for dinner.
What happened to your neck?
Oh, I scratched it.
Did it hurt?
Yeah, a little.
When are we leaving? Do I have to stay in here?
No, we don't. We're free to go now.
[Katrina] Yeah. No, you're right, Mom, I should have called you right back, but I just didn't want to bother you.
I should have called you right back, but I just didn't want to bother you. But we're hitting the road now, yeah.
No. Promise you, everything is all good.
[Clara] What letter are we up to?
Mommy?
What, sweetie?
What letter were we up to?
I can't remember.
You decide.
[Clara] Okay.
Hitchhiker, Mommy.
H for hitchhiker.
Did you see him, Clara?
Did you see him?
[Clara] Yeah.
Where do you think he's going, Mommy?
I'm not sure, sweetie.
[Clara] Your turn, Mommy. We're up to I.
Mommy? Come on, Mommy.
I...
I...
Why is there a monkey?
That is Iago.
Iago is a monkey?
I thought you said Iago was Jusuf Superior.
He is.
In more ways than one.
My father sent him here, so I would not be homesick
during my first Christmas away from the Kingdom,
and also to punish him for crashing the Royal Maserati.
Well, what is he doing in my bed?
Oh, he is just asserting his dominance. [chuckles]
The important thing is to not let him use his scent gland to mark it.
Too late. This is his bed now.
What's with the nasty old cabbages?  Is this for the monkey?
Teddy, you sound ridiculous.
The cabbages are for Magnus, the magical Christmas moose.
Not gonna ask, don't care.
Every Christmas Eve,
Magnus the Moose flies all over the world eating rotten cabbages
and pooping chocolate candies. [chuckles]
And the best part of all, Magnus performs miracles
for those who are true of heart.
It is the greatest Christmas tradition in the world.
No, the greatest Christmas tradition in the world
is the East Peoria Festival of Lights.
Last year, they brought the house down with a giant light-up wreath,
and four candy canes.
How will they ever top that?
Perhaps with five candy canes?
A boy could dream.
Peoria has some very strange traditions.
Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time for me
to scream my Christmas wish into a towel.
What was that?
That was me wishing for you to have a fantastically great Christmas.
And I think Iago wished for you to stay out of his bed.
Oh,  Teddy. [chuckles]
It does not work with a pillow.
I wasn't making a wish.
This is so much fun, Regina. Thank you for letting me help decorate.
Oh, anytime. And if you're lucky,
next time I'll let you decorate the windowsÂ with glass cleaner.
Sorry. Usually works on Emil.
I'm just glad to be out of the house.
My moms think Christmas is too commercial, so we never do anything fun.
You guys give each other gifts, right?
No.
But we do give each other feedback on areas of improvement.
Yeah, they call it "Constructive Criticis-mas."
Well, in that case, I hope you don't getÂ anything this year.
-Oh, that's so sweet! -[both chuckle]
Why don't you go up to the attic and get the rest of the decorations?
They're there behind a box marked "naked photos."
What?
They're just photos I haven't framed yet.
That is a terrible way to label that box.
Merry Christmas, Jingle Berries!
-Here's the tree you ordered. -Oh! Wow!
That is a whole lot of tree for 20 bucks,Â Braughner.
I keep my prices down by going straight to the source: the park.
This one even came with a piece of metal paper.
"On this spot,
1854, Abraham Lincoln." Yada, yada, yada... Who cares.
Well, you can't take it back, so...
Thanks, Abe.
Okay, you can set it up over there.
The bowling alley is officially closed. All the decorations are up,
and for the first time in my life, I have finished my Christmas shopping early.
Yes. It is time for some of Mama's special nog.
Regina, I brought you a gift!
Joosep!
-I didn't get Joosep a gift! -Oh! This is going to be awkward.
Merry Christmas to me.
It's very cold out here.
Oh, yes, it is warmer in here.
That's a pretty big gift, Regina. What did you get him?
Here's 20 more dollars to go away.
Go-away money's what bought me my dirt bike.
Can't believe you got me a gift. I mean, of course I got you a gift, too.
It's just I got to go find--
Wrap it.
So, I'll... BRB.
And Airbnb to you you as well.
Would you look at that?
"In 1854, Abraham Lincoln was in this veryÂ bowling alley."
Incredible.
What the heck are you doing?
Hanging smelly socks on a string to keep my wishes safe
from Wendell the Winter Weasel.
But those are my socks.
And they are the stinkiest.
-Who is it? -Sire, just me, Joosep, your royal guard,
living incognito in America to protectÂ your identity
as the only living heir to the Kingdom of Buronia.
Side question: is anyone elseÂ in there with you?
You already know. You don't count.
Anyway, sire, I have brought you your royal long johns
because it has begun to snow.
It would be a dereliction to my duties
for you to come down with a case of frostbutt.
You mean frostbite?
Please, if you ever had a caseÂ of frostbutt, you'd wish you had frostbite.
Whatever. The Festival of Lights starts in four hours,
so we better head down there to get a good seat.
Great idea! But why not get into the spirit
by singing a classic Buronian Christmas carol?
Because I don't want to?
Fine. One song.
-Yay! -Yay!
â™ª On the first day of Christmas Dear Magnus gave to meÂ â™ª
â™ª Asparagus from Jogan's GroceryÂ â™ª
Is that some kind of commercial?
â™ª On the second day of Christmas Dear Magnus gave to meÂ â™ª
â™ª Two-for-one ham special And asparagusÂ from Jogan's GroceryÂ â™ª
-â™ª On the third dayÂ  of Christmas...Â â™ª -Okay, that's definitely a commercial.
Sydney, I need your help.
The stores are closed for Christmas Eve, so I need something to re-giftÂ to Joosep.
What would you get a guy that you've hung out
but you're not dating, but you're not not dating?
There's a lot of gray area there.
I got it!
Horse costume.
No, it's got to be nice, but not too nice, or he'll think I care too much.
But if it's not nice enough, he'll thinkÂ I don'tÂ care at all.
There's a lot of gray area there.
So... horse costume.
You're overthinking this.
All I got Tanner for Christmas was a laser pointer, he loves it.
For school presentations?
No, he chases the dot around like a cat.
I don't want to offend you,
but I think Joosep is a little more mature and cultured than Tanner.
â™ª Four check-out lanes Three French pressÂ â™ª
â™ª Two-for-one ham special And asparagusÂ from Jogan's GroceryÂ â™ª
â™ª On the 350th Day of Christmas Dear Magnus gave to meÂ â™ª
[shouts] Stop! Stop! Just stop it right now.
But we only had 50 verses left.
Come on, let's get down to the lights. No!
What the heck is this?
Dude, it's snow.
Yes, yes, we appear to beÂ snowed in.
How could this happen?
Well, it appears a low-pressure system from the north
has combined with precipitation from the south,
resulting in the ample snowfall you see before you.
Where did that come from?
Have you seen this hair? I was born to be a weatherman.
Back to you, Teddy.
This is bad. This is really bad.
You're right to panic.
I've watched enough disaster movies to know this is going to get ugly quick.
Time to load up on rations.
It's a Magnus the Moose Miracle.
-Is this not wondrous, Teddy? -No.
We have to get to the light show. I've never missed it.
Do not worry, Teddy.
Magnus the Moose always provides
to the little boys and girls who scream into their towel the hardest.
I'm calling emergency services.
Okay, you distract Joosep, while I run down to the gas station
and get him some Lottery scratchers and some chocolate do-- Nuts!
-We're snowed in. -Ah, Regina, there you are.
This is a perfect time to open your gift.
No, no,Â not before I finish wrapping your gift,
which is really great, but not too great.
There's a lot of gray area there.
Hey, do you own a horse costume?
Of course.
It was the most wonderful gift I ever received.
I told you. [laughs]
I'm gonna find him something from the kitchen. Distract Joosep.
I'm on it.Â Joosep.
Look!
What is that?
Hey, the red dot's back.
Looks like we're going to be here a while.
Emil, I'm gonna be honest.
Okay, you're the only person here I trust.
We should form an alliance.
You frighten me, and I'm going to stand over here now.
Teddy, I'm going to be honest,
you're the only person here I trust.
We should form an alliance.
Braughner, I'm dealing with something very important right now.
Yes, I need a snow plow, so I can see some light-up candy canes.
Why should hospitals get first priority?
Well, I'm dying to see some Christmas lights.
Hello?
Hey, what are you doing up here?
I'm on my way to the Festival of Lights.
All I got to do is hop down the snowÂ bank,
then it's a breezy three-mile trip down to the light show.
I do not know if that's a great idea. It is fresh snow, so--
Oh, look at all this fun stuff!
Lights, costumes...
Naked photos?
They're just pictures without frames on them.
My mom's terrible at labeling boxes.
That explains this box of children'sÂ organs.
East Peoria Light Show, here I come!
Teddy!
I think I got frostbutt.
Teddy!
What are you doing?
[quavering] I'm going to the light show.
Doesn't really look like it.
Yeah, honey, it's snowing really hard out there.
I don't think we're gonna make it this year.
Oh, yes, we are.
Robots!
Robots!
Well, my son has officially lost it.
Now, help me wrap this couch.
Teddy, I have noticed you are a little worked up about missing the light show.
I'm not missing it!
Yes, that, there. That is what I'm talking about.
Why do you care so much?
I just do, okay, but it's all going to be fine.
Because Doug the Dig-Bot is going to drill us down to Detweiller Drive...
dude.
Well, before that, there's something I think you'll want to see downstairs.
Fine. I can't charge him up here anyway.
Iago is using up every outlet.
Why does a monkey even need a curling iron?
You think he just wakes up looking like that?
Okay, so I didn't have quite enough wrapping paper to finish the whole couch,
but what do you think?
I think the only thing you're worse at than labeling boxes is finding gifts.
But don't worry. You have time.
I taped the laser pointer to the ceiling fan,
Joosep and Tanner will be chasing that thing around for hours.
We got the dot!
And its hiding spot.
So, now that mystery's been solved, let us open your gift.
Hey, look!
We're out of nuts!
Can't have Christmas without nuts.
All right, so, what did you want to show me?
Well, I know you are a big fan of the Festival of Lights,
but I think you will forget all about that, once you see
Emil's Festival of Delights.
I found these in a box labeled "naughty" stuff.
Magnus provides.
[all] Magnus provides!
Now, everybody gather round and prepare to be dazzled.
Prepare to be dazzled!
Oh no, no. We only do that on "Magnus provides."
[shouts] Emil, don't!
No, no, no! [grunts]
Oh, dear. The power's gone out.
I don't like the dark. I don't like the dark!
Things are about to get crazy, muscles.
I'm going to be honest. You're the only person here I trust.
-What do you think about alliances? -Alliances?
I think they're my favorite animal in the zoo.
Never mind.
Come on, Tanner, let's goÂ find some flashlights.
And I'll come with you because I'm currently terrified.
It's no use. The power's out,
and you totally fried Doug the Dig-Bot.
Now I'll never make it to the Festival of Lights.
I am sorry, Teddy
But, do not worry.
The wish that I screamed very loudly into a towel
was for you to have a fantastically great Christmas.
Magnus will make this right.
Dude, enough with the Magnus.
But Magnus always provides.
[Joosep and Tanner] Magnus provides!
Although he usually does grant his wishes by now,
but that is no reason to lose our faith in Magnus.
Magnus isn't real.
It's clearly something Buronian parentsÂ made up
for their gullible kids to believe in.
Oh, yeah? Then where do the chocolate poops come from?
They're chocolate kisses.
-But that would mean my wishes-- -Are never coming true.
Nobody's wishes are coming true!
Don't look at me like that.
[Regina] Hey, Teddy.
-What are you doing up here? -Trying to see the end of the light show.
Oh, I think I saw something!
Just a stupid shooting star.
Okay, what's going on with you?
I wanted to see the candy canes as much as anybody, but it's not that big a deal.
It's not the candy canes.
It's Dad.
The Festival of Lights was his favorite,  remember?
He used to always take us.
Of course I remember. He'd put on that Santa hat
and play Mariah Carey's Christmas albumÂ on a loop.
It was so annoying.
So annoying.
And I really miss him.
Me, too.
Every year, since he passed away, I feel like...
I remember less and less about him.
The light show always reminds me.
I guess I'm just afraid that if I don't go, then...
I'll forget him.
Teddy, you could never forget your dad.
He's a part of you.
You think you got all that science stuff from me?
Definitely not.
Okay. A little quick with the answer there.
We'll always miss your dad.
But we're still a family.
And now Emil is a part of our family, too.
Oh, Emil.
I think I might have totally ruined his Christmas.
Oh, I'm sure it's not that bad.
As long as you didn't tell him that, that Magical Moose isn't real.
Well...
Teddy!
I know.
Well, maybe you still have time to make it up to him.
Maybe you're right.
Thanks, Mom.
Anytime.
That was a real sweet moment back there.
Braughner, what are you doing up here?
Look, Regina. I'm going to be honest.
You're the only person around hereÂ I trust.
What do you say we form an alliance?
Yeah, I'm already in an alliance with everybody else.
Except you.
What? You all turned against me?
You traitors!
Okay, so what's it goingÂ to take to get me in?
Two hundred bucks?
Deal!
Hey guys! I'm in the alliance!
Okay. Okay. I'm downstairs.
Can you stop pulling my hair with your dirty little paws?
-[monkey eeks] -Okay, I deserve that.
Is that... Magnus?
Yes, it is me, Magnus,
and I am here to restore your faith in...
me, Magnus.
And I'm a butt.
Quiet, Butt!
Regina! Found some more candles and...
Oh, hot lemon cider!
It's Magnus!
Yes, but...
stand back, because I got gas from all theÂ cabbage I've been eating.
[Tanner] You do?
[Teddy] Be quiet, Butt!
Well, surely you do not have too much gas to perform your signature song and dance.
My what?
You know, the Clip-Clop Hop.
[chuckles] I don't know. I'm very tired.
Wait. If you really were Magnus, you would want to do the Clip-Clop Hop.
Thank you... Joosep.
He knows my name.
Here goes something.
â™ª I am theÂ Christmas MooseÂ â™ª
â™ª Magnus, the Christmas MooseÂ â™ª
â™ª I come from the land of the troutÂ â™ª
â™ª The Christmas Moose!Â â™ª
â™ª Magnus, the Christmas MooseÂ â™ª
â™ª Do not put your fingers near my snoutÂ â™ª
Happy Birthday!
Magnus!
Oops.
Com on, Tanner.
I appreciate your silly little stunt, Teddy.
How'd you know it was me?
From... everything.
I was the butt.
Yes, you were.
Listen, Emil.
I'm really sorry about earlier.
I was just mad about missing the light show because... [sighs]
it's something I shared with my dad.
Oh,Teddy, I had no idea.
But that's no reason for meÂ to ruin your Christmas.
I mean, for all I know, Magnus could exist.
No, no. You were right.
It never made much sense.
I mean, why would a moose want a rotten cabbage?
That's what you find hard to believe?
It is too bad, though, because really,
I did wish for you to have a fantastically great Christmas.
But... I guess it was silly for me to believe in miracles.
What was that?
Are you guys hearing that, too?
I think it's coming from the lanes.
I could've sworn it was--
Wow!
It's beautiful.
I bet I can catch him!
This is incredible!
Wait.
Is this my present?
Yes! Of course it is. I mean, it certainly wasn't this.
Well, I do feel badly that my gift is so practical.
An industrial strength snowblower?
Yes, I heard it was going to snow, and I thought it might come in handy
to get us to the Festival of Lights.
This is freaking majestic.
Something is going on with my eyes.
They're sweating.
I don't know why there's a monkey here.
Bring it in, fur ball!
It's nice.
My dad would have loved this.
This is a fantastically great Christmas.
How did you make a festival of lights right here in the bowling alley?
I did not do this. I thought you did.
What?
The power is still out.
There's no scientific explanation for any of this.
-Magnus? -Magnus?
Is that cabbage?
Is this poop?
No.
It's chocolate poop.
Look!
Is that a flying moose?
It's a miracle!
It really is.
Magnus provides.
[all] Magnus provides.
Oh, just a head's up, not all of these poops are chocolate.
â™ª Christmas MooseÂ â™ª
â™ª Magnus, the Christmas MooseÂ â™ª
â™ª He comes from the land of the troutÂ â™ª
â™ª The Christmas MooseÂ â™ª
â™ª Magnus, the Christmas MooseÂ â™ª
â™ª Do not put your fingers near his snoutÂ â™ª
â™ª He's the Christmas MooseÂ â™ª
â™ª Magnus, the Christmas MooseÂ â™ª
â™ª Brings miracles and joy to allÂ â™ª
â™ª The Christmas MooseÂ â™ª
â™ª Magnus, the Christmas MooseÂ â™ª
Good? Cool? [sniffles]
-[clears throat] -[producer] Whenever you're ready.
Electronica isn't just music for me.
That beat is like my heart sound.
[DJ Fingablast] And I became a DJ
because of one man:
â€ŽDJ Slizzard.
â€ŽAnd this is his story.
â€ŽBut mostly...
it's my story.
Thanks for the fluff, DJ Bear Dick.
Dilly-dilly, fam!
[announcer] Brisbane, give it up for DJ Fingablast
and a hologram of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.!
[Dr. King hologram] I have a--
-[electronic music playing] -â™ª Beat, beat â™ª
â™ª Beat, beat, beat... â™ª
[DJ Fingablast] I was on top of the world.
I had mo' money
and fewer problems, yo.
And I had something almost as important as money.
-[music winds down] -Love.
-[mellow music playing] -That smokestack right there
is my girl,
Hello Hadid, the third Hadid sister.
[Hello] Hey, guys, how amazing are pennies?
[DJ Fingablast] Her eyes are the sexiest
'cause she's super allergic to her mascara.
We met having sex at a vodka launch party.
True love, brah!
I knew I had to lock that ish down.
[whispering] Oh, man. I'm so nervous, but pumped.
She's gonna love this. Shh.
Hey, Lo. I'm not good at talking about my feelings
'cause of my childhood,
so I let my music speak for me.
So what do you say, babe?
Will you marry me?
No homo?
M'kay.
Yes!
Yes!
Boom!
But who was gonna DJ my wedding?
Who could DJ my wedding?
â€Ž[Richard] â€ŽWe gotta get this party going, â€Žif you don't mind.
We got the follow-up hit to the Baha Men's "Who Let the Dogs Out?"
That's right, it's...
"When Let The Dogs Out?"
[man] â™ª When let the dogs out? â™ª
-[men] â™ª When, when, when? â™ª -That's right.
-[man] â™ª When let the dogs out? â™ª -[men] â™ª When, when, when? â™ª
-[men] â™ª When, when... â™ª -This guy's the king!
[Richard] Hey, uh, bartender?
Think the DJ could get another one of these juice boxes, please?
That'd be super.
[young Fingablast] Excuse me, can I ask you a question?
Sure, baby.
What do you wa-- Oh, man.
You're a boy. You sound just like a chick.
You know that's why they hire adult women to play boys in cartoons?
-[young Fingablast] Bart Simpson's a girl? -Yeah, he is.
[young Fingablast] Well, you were awesome.
And when I grow up, I want to be like you.
-Well, you're gonna need a weird penis. -[young Fingablast] Okay!
Um, do you have any tips for kids who want to be DJs?
Oh... uh...
yeah, sure. You know...
uh...
don't do drugs...
on an army base.
Stay in school...
for, like, five years too long,
'cause then you're way bigger than all the teachers,
and then it's your school.
Get the limbo line to come to you, 'cause then you can see up stuff.
Know what I mean?
[DJ Fingablast] Who could DJ my wedding?
The answer was obvious:
DJ Slizzard.
Little did I know...
I didn't know what I was in for.
-[geese honking] -[moody string music playing]
[DJ Fingablast] DJ Slizzard was the only man on Earth
who could spin at my wedding.
But where was he?
Hey, guys! DJ Slizzard is north Indiana's only DJ for all your party needs,
from sweet 16s
to dirty 30s
to nasty 90s!
Additionally, I am the proud possessor
of The Guinness Book of World Records for highest FPM in Grundel County.
[DJ Fingablast] So I flew to Indiana
and set up a camera at the airport.
Then I flew back to New York
and got on another plane to Indiana
so I could get this footage of my plane landing.
This here is Slizzard Country.
Here we go. This looks like it's it.
[man] Hey, hey, hey!
You boys on private property!
You better watch it!
I know some karate videos I can throw at you.
Whoa, whoa, bro, I'm not looking for trouble--
only treble and bass.
And the guy who used to live here.
Who? Dick Wayne?
[DJ Fingablast] Dick Wayne must be DJ Slizzard's real name,
which explains the D.
But where did the J come from?
Boy, what are you staring at?
Do you know when Maestro Wayne'll be back?
[Bankston] Man, that dude is long gone.
So, legally,
all of his hairbrushes are mine...
even if some of his relatives come around looking for them.
DJ Slizzard is dead?
[Bankston] He's in prison.
Forever. Ever.
Ever.
Ever.
[coughs] I'm sorry.
Forgot to take my medication this morning.
Orning. Orning.
Orning.
[DJ Fingablast] DJ Sliz, in priz?
It didn't make any sense.
I mean, DJ Slizzard is the legend who brought the air horn to the Midwest.
[Richard laughs] That's right!
Get it up, get it up, get it up!
Just because you're pregnant doesn't mean you cannot dance.
-Let's go. -[air horn blares]
-[producer] What do you think he did? -[clicks tongue]
There's only one thing I can think of.
His beats must have started a shorty fire on the dance floor.
Cause of death? Fire burns.
Beats that sick gotta be illegal.
You're under arrest.
It's the only explanation.
And yet, it also wasn't.
Well, the little stinker in tonight's Naughty Neighbors Nook
is Richard Wayne Gary Wayne.
The Durnsville resident and adjunct professor at Trump University
was apprehended earlier today after acting weird at a Walmart.
â€ŽI need these tampons because I am a woman,
â€Žand I wanna swim with confidence.
â€Ž[officer]â€Ž Okay, sir.
â€Ž[Richard] â€ŽKarate!
â€ŽKarate! Karate! Regular punch!
â€ŽJust kidding. That was karate.
[officer] Care to explain this key we found at your house, Dick?
It's labeled "bunker," comma, "girls."
So? Girls are keys.
Everyone knows that.
'Cause they love rings, and they'll poke you in the scrotum
if you sit on 'em wrong. [snickers]
Everybody knows keys are boys! Locks are girls!
What's in the bunker, Dick?
[reporter] They look like women, but they stink like hogs.
Fifteen years in an underground bunker explains some of it.
[Kimmy and Cyndee] The world's still here!
This is the bomb!
After all that time together,
we're pretty synced up.
Library.
Melissa Joan Hart.
Razzmatazz!
Ah, the "Macarena." Wonderful.
-Remember when Dr. Evil did it? -Ay!
I think I should get out of the sun now.
I'll just be in the bunker.
[Kimmy] Do you have a mirror?
Oh. No, sorry,
I asked for a mirror,
not a picture of an old Irish witch.
Tabby Bobatti, you were the Reverend's live-in girlfriend,
but you didn't know what was happening?
Well, it's healthy
to have secrets in a relationship.
He doesn't know about half the yarn I buy.
You were his fudging girlfriend?
Well, it's hard to find a tall guy.
-[Tabby] Oh! -[mirror shatters]
[reporter] Richard Wayne Gary Wayne was sentenced today
to three counts of white kidnapping
and one count of "oopsie, no bueno."
-[geese honking] -[somber string music playing]
[DJ Fingablast] How could someone who created so much beauty
be responsible for such butt ugliness?
How can I get married without a kick-ass DJ?
And also,
was I skipping stones wrong?
To answer that question, I consulted champion stone skipper
Damar Varnish at his estate, Rockswater.
No.
You've gotta...
side-arm it.
Like that.
[DJ Fingablast] My other questions,
-only one man could... -[line rings]
...should, and would answer them.
[Richard] Richard Wayne. Who's this?
Oh! This is him.
Uh, hello, sir. This is Douglas Fingerbur--
DJ Fingablast.
I wanna talk to you about why you're in prison.
[Richard] Hang on, this is a dude?
'Cause this whole prison deal is kind of a sausage fest.
Anyone who visits better be ready
to put something I don't have on the glass.
Boobs, butt--
Wait, you don't have a butt?
[DJ Fingablast] My hero doesn't have a butt...
but I do.
And if I'm ever gonna meet him...
I gotta catfish DJ Slizzard.
So I made a fake Facebook profile
that was sure to get his attention.
This is all for us, babe.
[Hello] I'm cold.
[DJ Fingablast] But then
I learned something from a rerun of CSI: Miami
that I was unable to get the rights to.
He won't be liking any more pictures of corpses on Facebook.
Because prisoners aren't allowed to use Facebook.
â™ª Yeah! â™ª
[DJ Fingablast] I printed Karen's page and mailed it to DJ Slizzard.
For authenticity, I also included a pair of ladies' underwear
that I rubbed on a small dog.
[DJ Fingablast] Let's do this.
DJ Slizzard, here we come.
Well, well, well, Miss Sorrento.
Me likey.
Now, uh...
why don't you put something on the glass?
Chef's choice.
Omakase!
You need to put something on the glass for me first:
answers.
Oh, man.
Another catfish?
Shoot.
[DJ Fingablast] I worshipped you, man.
How could you do something so sick?
And not good sick, like sneakers you wait in line for.
Bad sick, like when they found E.T. in that stream.
What's going on with the camera?
Oh, I'm making a documentary.
-About me? -No, it's about me
needing a DJ for my wedding.
[Richard] Stupid. Why would anybody
wanna make a... a movie about ole Dicky Slizzard, right?
Only thing I've ever been good at is manipulating people.
[DJ Fingablast] Hey, don't say that. You were also a great DJ.
Yeah, I were.
I mean, it's hopeless for me.
For somebody to get my case reopened,
they'd have to be really smart,
have to have some money,
bunch of cameras.
They'd have to have a...
a visitor's pass to this prison.
I mean... [scoffs]
Good luck, Dick!
I'm out of here, man.
-Sliz, wait. -What?
Could I really get your case reopened?
Like, is that a real thing?
Adnan from Serial,
Staircase guy,
Dr. Richard Kimble...
they all had their cases reopened because of a supersmart documentary
that didn't leave anything out.
[DJ Fingablast] And that's when,
all on my own,
I came up with a new idea for what my documentary should be about.
So I started looking into it.
And this whole thing...
didn't make any sense.
[Richard] I mean, have you even seen these "Mole Women"?
There is a reason that they're named after the least attractive insectivore.
To quote my personal hero
and, oh, I don't know,
the President...
[Donald Trump] Take a look. Look at her.
You tell me what you think.
I don't think so. I don't think so.
Believe me,
she would not be my first choice.
That, I can tell you.
[DJ Fingablast] Look, DJ Slizzard is hot--
as hot as the hottest insectivore.
Did the Mole Women match up?
It was horrible. [sobs]
And I missed, like, ten Olympics.
It was only nine, Miss Schmidt.
[Dunleavy] Now are you ready to be honest with us?
Hi, Donna Maria NuÃ±ez?
I'm DJ Fingablast. I'm making a documentary.
-How old are you? -[Donna Maria] Huh?
Show us the birth cert!
[in Spanish] I didn't know that the monkeys who work in my factories
-were underage. -No, how old are you?
[rapidly] BunCo Bunkers' five-year warranty is void
in the state of purchase. 0% APR financing intended as a joke.
Product not endorsed by the Peyton Manning who plays football.
[Richard] FYI, my fantasy bunker...
Copperfield-era Claudia Schiffer,
two Maria Menounoses,
and one of them pomegranate juice bottles.
Bam, bam, buh-bam!
DJ Slizzard, I'm starting to think...
-you didn't even do it. -[Richard] Hey, look,
you're the documentary guy. I'm just a kidnapper. Just a... reverend.
I-I'm just a...
I'm just an American DJ.
If you didn't do it, who did?
You know what? Why don't you ask yourself this:
who stood to benefit...
from this guy being locked up?
Like Hillary should've been.
Think about it.
I mean, I did have a rival.
DJ Traphouse.
[DJ Fingablast] Another DJ?
As one of our own, I couldn't believe
that one of our own could do this
to one of our own.
And with you out of the way--
Oh, to him fall the spoils
of my... Golden... Kingdom:
three p.m. slot at Slappy's Pizza;
signature banter,
like, "Wake up, fatties, it's time to boogie";
and my antique buffalo-horn and boar-bristle hairbrush collection.
[DJ Fingablast] I finally had a lead.
You need to find DJ Traphouse.
[DJ Fingablast] I had to find DJ Traphouse and get him to confess.
Then Slizzard could J my wedding.
But no matter how much I drove around,
I couldn't find him
or get him to confess.
So I gave up, did ayahuasca in a cemetery,
and it led me straight to Traphouse's current address.
[producer] Hey, he's here.
[DJ Fingablast] My hero is in jail,
and the only person who could free him is dead.
And I still don't have a wedding DJ.
So I went back to the only place
where I'd ever truly felt safe:
Rockswater.
-More sideways. -Okay.
That's it.
[DJ Fingablast] Then everything went
-from bad... -[cell phone chimes]
...to, "Oh, no, you didn't."
Hey, everyone. I said m'kay.
#pennies.
[operator] Do you accept a collect call from Grundel County Men's Prison?
[DJ Fingablast] Yes, I do.
[Richard] What do you mean, you're "out"?!
You're leaving me hanging, like my cellmate who couldn't take it.
[sighs] Sliz, there's no point.
I don't need a DJ for my wedding anymore.
[Richard] You're like the Drunk History guy.
You got Tiffany Haddish right here,
and you're making this about you?!
She dumped me like a poop, bro.
[imitating cell phone] Bleep-bloop!
She dumped me like a poop, bruh.
[DJ Fingablast] There was nothing left for me in Indiana,
so I took my airport camera and went back to New York.
Where's the off switch?
Oh, there it is.
Why? [sobs]
I don't wanna say good-bye to Hello.
-[electronic music playing] -I was lost.
There was no point continuing with the film.
[man] â™ª Life's not always Miami â™ª
Ah, turn off the camera!
-The documentary's off! -[man] â™ª Life's not always Miami â™ª
-[switch clicks] -[DJ Fingablast] Then...
-[cell phone chimes] -...everything changed.
Hey, yo!
Take off your wrap gifts, guys.
The documentary is not over.
I might need a wedding DJ after all.
Someone posted on Karen Sorrento's Facebook page.
[cameraman] But that's a straight man,
and Karen is you pretending to be--
I just need a win, Scott.
And I said take your fleece off!
Let's go, boys!
Come on! Whoo!
-Wow. -[both laugh]
[Fran] That's amazing.
-I love sour cream. -[laughing] Oh, who doesn't?
[Fran] Instead of a tip, I just wrote, "Here's a tip, try the cheese."
-She's probably mad. -Oh!
-This is mad fun. -[laughs] Yeah.
But I gotta come clean...
I'm not a beautiful woman.
I'm a beautiful man...
a man who now feels pretty good about himself thanks to you, Fran.
Another catfish.
Damn it. I knew you were too cool to be a female.
Cool like how?
Look at your profile, dude. You're a dream girl.
MAGA, ka-ra-tay, DJ Slizzard...
[stammers] ...girls in bikinis getting really hurt.
Wait, you're a Slizzard Lizard?
Are you kidding me?
He played my great-aunt's nasty 90th.
-[laughs] -And he went home with her...
as a joke.
-[laughs] -God, it just kills me
that he's still locked up.
Especially since I know he shouldn't even be in jail.
[DJ Fingablast] I don't believe in fate,
so it was probably magic elves who brought Fran and me together that night.
Hi. Um...
I am Fran Dodd.
I am founder and C-F-Bro of The Innocence Broject,
an organization that fights back in the war on men.
I am telling you, man,
men are under attack.
Do you know how many times I have been stabbed with keys?
Nineteen times, just for
walking closely to a woman's face.
This is where, uh,
we keep a lot of, like, our--our case files here,
like, uh, Cosby.
That's a big one.
Uh, Mr. Frumpus.
Richard--Richard's file?
Yeah, it's in here.
This is all proof.
How about this right here?
Where is Dick Wayne being held right now?
Okay, well, let's just take a look right here...
'cause this is where Dick Wayne is being held.
Can you get close enough?
Says it right here. Right here.
Men--
Men's Prison.
Not People's Prison.
Mee-en's Prison. Okay?
They knew when they built this place who they were gonna lock up.
It's absolutely disgusting.
Masculinity is being criminalized in this country, okay?
And I want something done did about it.
Because what you're accused of
-shouldn't be a crime. -[Richard] Exactly.
I mean, are we even talking about?
Innocent and--and guilty?
Sorry, what I did was called "nature."
I mean, look at dolphins. They're huge rapists,
and ladies kiss them right on their holes over at SeaWorld.
Why isn't anybody getting a tattoo of me on their ankle?
Men are not the problem. Women are the problem.
Things were fine until we started letting them make their own decisions.
L-listen, y'all. Let me tell you
about a--about a good friend of mine
who's really handsome.
And he went...
to LA, saved up all his money,
got a sweet-ass butt cut,
and did the ladies a favor...
by going on a TV dating show.
[host] Richard, how are you gonna make her feel special?
Well...
we'd start off with some fabulous food,
-a little fabulous conversation... -[laughter]
...end it with a fabulous foot massage,
for an evening of total fabulosity.
And she chose Marc!
I mean, what?
They got to go to the zoo together.
Why does she even get to choose at all?
Men should be doing the choosing!
Man.
I thought women should do what they want, but if they couldn't,
I'd still be with Hello.
God, why'd she dump me?
Because women are stupid.
They don't even know how to make decisions good.
You should see my mommy try and order at a restaurant.
[DJ Fingablast] So that night,
I did.
[woman] Southern rib platter. Yum!
-No, I'll never eat all that. -No.
But if you were gonna pick between the French dip...
-French dip. -...and the firehouse fajitas--
-French dip. -Oh, my God, what do they have?
-[hand slams table] -God, it is dessert, Sheila!
They are having dessert.
[Richard] It's dark days, brosephs.
They say, "You snooze, you lose."
Well, we snossed...
and look what we lost.
[DJ Fingablast] After talking to Fran and DJ Sliz,
I read the news.
And it was news to me.
There really is a war going on.
I mean, who's next,
the majestic anteater?
I also learned
our infrastructure is a mess, yo!
[Richard] Here we are. Now it's "Person of the Year."
They hijacked the Ocean's franchise.
Now there's a female Colonel Sanders?
What's next, female chickens?
I don't even get it, y'all.
But if we don't take a stand now...
-we're herstory. -[Fran] Ugh.
They're gonna shestroy everything.
[Richard] I ain't down
with that world.
I have an appointment
for a penis removal,
-here in the year... -[musical sting]
-...this year!
[distorted echo] This year, this year, this year, this year, this year...
[DJ Fingablast] We have to fight back,
or pretty soon, every clip package
will look like this.
A great man rots in jail right now
because Lady Justice
is living up to her name.
That coldhearted skank is just ice.
Meanwhile, what are DJ Slizzard's supposed victims doing?
Cyndee Pokorny continues to profit
from her tragedy.
She recently sang the national anthem at an NFL preseason game
between the Atlanta Vaccinators
and the Chicago Interracial Marriages.
â™ª And the home â™ª
[quietly] â™ª Of the â™ª
[warbling] â™ª Bra... â™ª
[DJ Fingablast] And as for Donna Maria?
She used wordplay to become a mole sauce
mole-ionnaire and...
a judge on Shark Tank EspaÃ±ol.
[in Spanish] Marco Americano here is crazy.
What you've just described is a horse.
I'm out.
[DJ Fingablast] And Gretchen Chalker is the real cult leader.
She's now running her own church
inside a women's prison!
What?
Now they're keeping us out of the prisons we built?
And in the future,
female doctors will remove the penises
with saws.
-Yes! That's right! -[cheers and applause]
[DJ Fingablast] Then there's Kimmy Schmidt.
[DJ Fingablast] The woman who put Tabby Bobatti in intensive care...
ended up intensively caring about the Reverend.
-That's good writing. -[Kimmy grunting]
[DJ Fingablast] No wonder she was so mad at Tabby.
Kimmy is married to DJ Slizzard.
And she never gave up on bae.
[Kimmy] I'll never divorce you, Dick! Not even when pigs fly!
But that would be cute! Birds would be like, "Whaaaaat?!"
I'm never divorcing you!
[DJ Fingablast] Maybe this documentary isn't about finding a DJ for my wedding.
It's just about the best DJ of all:
love.
[Richard] Have yo-o-o-ou...
spoken to Kimmy?
Oh, for the documentary?
Shoot, that's a good idea.
[Richard] No, don't ever
speak to her. I mean, because...
we value...
we value our privacy.
That's why I didn't say anything about it.
You know? Even though
our marriage would obviously humanize me,
audience-wise.
Wow.
Kimmy stood by you, man. [chuckles]
#NotAllWomen.
[Richard] So I guess...
...if a good woman like Kimmy
is on my side--and she is, but again, don't ask her--
then maybe the whole word can get on board
with my fabulosity.
You gotta finish this movie, Finga.
Finish it up. Hey, win a Peabody,
like Entourage.
Then who knows, man? Who knows?
Maybe my case gets reopened,
and maybe I finally get reunited
with my little pasty-faced,
ketchup-headed...
...sweetie pateetie.
Kimmy. That's who I'm talking about. You know.
[DJ Fingablast] I did my part.
You just watched it.
Still are.
So does Slizzard's story end here?
That's up to the people who believe in him.
People like Fran Dodd;
Fran's mom, who supports him no matter what;
Fran's buddy Frisco, who you didn't meet but is cool;
this guy we met who would literally do anything;
and, of course,
-Kimmy Schmidt... -Well--
[DJ Fingablast] ...TabbyBobatti; this lady;
-that dude... -What is this for?
[DJ Fingablast] Karen Sorrento; David Caruso;
Damar Varnish; DJ Traphouse;
DJ Trump;
and the most important person...
you, America.
Dude, they won't be able to see themselves.
We talked about this.
[DJ Fingablast] Put this part in slow motion!
So that's what that job was. [gasps]
Fooping shit!
[robotic voice] â™ª Life's not always Miami â™ª

I love Halloween! It's the...
I love Halloween! It's the... ...best night of the year!
Vida, what's your favourite part of Halloween?
I don't know. We never celebrate Halloween in Monster Town.
Really? You never went trick or treating?
No. But Lobo says it's lots of fun!
It is! It is! For sure, for sure.
People will really just give us sweeties?
People give out all kinds of different sweeties.
Pickle jellies, and gummy bats.
Even monster-mallows? That's my favourite sweetie!
I'm sure someone will have monster-mallows.
They will. You just have to say "trick or treat" and ta-da! Sweeties!
Trick or treat!
Happy Halloween!
Thank you!
Hey, you made it just in time.
Sun down! Monsters up!
Drac!
Katya.
Lobo!
Zoe.
Frankie!
Cleo!
Spike!
Vida!
Super Monsters!
Grandma, are you coming trick or treating with us?
Sorry, sweetheart. I can't.
I have to get ready for our DÃ­a de los Muertos party.
Don't worry about the party, Mama.
We're going to take care of everything.
And we're going to help!
That's why we're trick or treating early.
So we can stay here and help with the party.
We love helping. And we love parties.
And we really love holiday parties.
Even for holidays we've never heard of before. Like DÃ­a... DÃ­a... de...
DÃ­a de los Muertos. And there's a lot to do to get ready!
Let's go.
If Cleo, Spike, and Zoe are helping get ready for the party,
does that mean you can come trick or treating with us?
It does! So let's get going.
-I can't wait to trick or treat. -Trick or treat.
Ready to try something new and fun?
Okay.
Trick or treating is extra fun for Super Monsters.
We use our super powers to show our neighbours really fun tricks.
And that's when they give us sweeties?
Come on! We'll show you how it's done! Just watch us.
Wait until you see my pumpkin juggling trick.
Watch this. Mega-size!
Very impressive!
Wow! That's a great trick, Frankie!
Thanks, but I'm not done yet.
Oops. Thanks for the help, Grandma.
Thanks for the sweeties!
It's monster magic time!
It's Halloween. So this is my chance.
Just watch me make this scarecrow dance!
Shall we dance?
Thank you.
Now this is how you trick or treat.
Oh, yes! Even my moves have... moves.
Oh, bats!
Thanks.
Hey, Vida, watch how fast your cousin Lobo can trick or treat.
That's what I call trick or speeding!
Lobo, did you remember to say thank you?
I was going so fast I forgot.
Come on. Let's go.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you for the sweeties.
Trick or treating is certainly a lot of work.
It certainly can be.
How are you doing, Vida?
I'm okay, I suppose. It's just all so different.
Sweets and costumes, and glowy pumpkin faces.
Maybe it would help
if we explained a little more about our Halloween traditions.
I'll start. See those costumes, Vida?
On Halloween, people dress up as something they love
On Halloween, people dress up as something they love or wish they could be.
Like princesses and pirates.
And lots of kids dress up like us!
Because everyone loves monsters.
They do!
And those glowing pumpkins are called jack-o'-lanterns
because people used to put candles inside of pumpkins to turn them into lanterns.
And a jack-o'-lantern outside the front door was an invitation.
It invited people to come to the house and celebrate Halloween.
Yeah, costumes and jack-o'-lanterns are fun,
but the best part about Halloween is the chocolate.
Chocolate? No way! It's the gumballs.
It's the chocolate. -Gumballs! -Chocolate.
-Gumballs! -Chocolate. Don't worry, Vida. All the Halloween sweeties are good.
Don't worry, Vida. All the Halloween sweeties are good.
I haven't seen any monster-mallows yet and those are my favourite.
I'm sure we'll find some.
I'm just going to run home
and see how things are going with the party preparations.
What is going on here?
Mama, what are you doing back here?
I came to see how the party set-up is going. What's this?
We're just getting a slow start.
Well, it's time to kick it into gear, my children!
Cleo, can you use your wind power to clear away all the leaves
and then smooth out the tablecloths?
Okay.
Spike, will you use your dragon clouds to fill these balloons?
They're shaped like sugar skulls. See?
No problem.
I'm making the papel picado banners.
Mama, what about the bread?
The bread? Well, you and your sister have watched me bake it every year. Right?
The bread? Well, you and your sister have watched me bake it every year. Right? Yeah. Sure.
Yeah. Sure. I guess we can do it.
Yeah, of course we can. Easy.
You two need to get back to work,
and I need to get back to trick or treating.
Okay, Vida. Ready to give it a try?
Okay.
-Trick or treat. -Boo!
Yikes! No, no, no!
Vida, wait! Where are you going?
Vida, wait! It's okay, Super Monsters. I'll make sure Vida gets home safe.
It's okay, Super Monsters. I'll make sure Vida gets home safe.
Vida, your plant magic really made the neighbourhood look so pretty.
The roses reminded me of Monster Town,
but everything else tonight was so strange and different.
It made me nervous.
Vida, we're sorry tonight made you nervous.
We just wanted you to have fun.
Thanks everyone.
I was nervous, but I did have fun too.
You did?
I liked Frankie's juggling and Katya's dancing scarecrow, and the way Drac made it rain sweeties.
and Katya's dancing scarecrow, and the way Drac made it rain sweeties.
Hey. Speaking of sweeties, check this out.
Whoa! That's a lot of sweeties.
We got so excited about showing off our tricks.
And trying to explain everything about Halloween.
We almost forgot to tell you the best part about trick or treating.
When it's done, we all share our sweeties!
And because we know how much you really like monster-mallows,
we saved all of them just for you!
Wow! Thank you everybody!
You know, I think I like this holiday.
I told you. Halloween is... ...the best night of the year!
George, Maya, is everything ready for the DÃ­a de los Muertos party?
We still need to finish making the bread.
And we need to finish decorating the garden.
We just need a little more time.
So hop to it! Chop chop!
-Let's go. -Okay, what do we need to do?
The papel picado banners are ready, but we need to hang them up.
That's easy. Spike and I can fly them into place.
But what about the sugar skull balloons? Do you think they're too small?
They could definitely be bigger.
But how much bigger?
Maybe we should ask Lobo's dad.
Good idea.
You said you knew how to make bread!
I thought I did. Mama always makes it look so easy.
Okay. Maybe it will look better when it's cooked.
Right, let's put it in the oven
and hope it works.
Maybe we shouldn't bother them.
Right. I'm sure we can work it out without their help.
I have a great idea. Come on.
So you've never celebrated DÃ­a de los Muertos before?
I've never even heard of it.
It's a wonderful holiday.
There's food, and flowers, and music, and--
And party games?
No. No. No party games.
I just need to go home
to get my magician's hat.
Now, who wants to see a magic trick?
Sorry, Drac, but tonight isn't about magic tricks.
Do you need some real magic? I could write a spell.
Maybe instead of everyone guessing what tonight is about,
we should ask Vida and Grandma to explain it to us.
-Right. -What is it? DÃ­a de los Muertos is a celebration
to remember the people who are no longer with us.
Like who?
Well, like my husband, Grandpa.
He was Lobo and Vida's grandfather.
He was a wonderful werewolf.
Was he fast? Yes! He was very speedy. Just like you, Lobo.
Yes! He was very speedy. Just like you, Lobo.
And he was full of life and very loving.
Just like you, Vida.
So, on DÃ­a de los Muertos, we remember Grandpa
and all the people that we miss.
It's just like that song, "Together Again."
Yes! You know it?
I do.
We're ready to celebrate DÃ­a de los Muertos.
Everything looks great.
I thought these balloons would be bigger.
Well...
One of them is.
Way, way bigger.
Look, look, look! It's a giant sugar skull!
Oh, no! That balloon is too big!
Bad news, Mama.
We should have asked you how to make the bread.
And we should have asked how big to make the balloon.
You know, children  it's always a good idea to ask for help
You know, children  it's always a good idea to ask for help if you aren't sure how to do something.
That's true for grown-ups too.
I agree.
Oh, no!
Runaway balloon!
Super Monsters, we have to...
...catch that balloon!
Mummy power!
Fast, fast, fast!
There it is!
Flying Super Monsters to the rescue!
Careful, Drac!
I've got this.
It's getting away!
-We need a way to hold on to it! -On it!
Witch's magic, glow like candles.
We need that balloon to grow some handles!
Oh, bats!
I have an idea.
May I?
Vida has the balloon.
Grab my hand.
That was amazing!
Need some help?
Mega-size!
We did it!
-Hey, yay! -Well done!
You did it!
-Look at that. -Amazing, yeah.
Well done, Super Monsters.
You brought back the balloon!
And you brought more people to celebrate DÃ­a de los Muertos.
But I think there's too many people for our garden!
No problem. We'll just have to bring the party here.
Come on, Super Monsters. Follow me.
Looks like we have plenty of food for everyone.
We do.
I'm just sorry there won't be any pan de muerto for the party.
Yeah, your mum and I really blew it with the bread.
Did someone say bread?
Mama, how did you make all that bread so fast?
Let's just say I might be old, but I am quick on my feet.
What's that table, Grandma?
That's called an ofrenda,
which means it's an offering.
It's how we remember the people that came before us.
This was your Grandpa's favourite bread.
Are you okay, Katya?
I've never celebrated DÃ­a de los Muertos before.
It feels kind of strange, huh?
It's all so different. The candles, the decorations...
That's how I felt about Halloween.
It was?
It was all so different from what I was used to.
Costumes, the sweeties. And I ended up liking it a lot.
Everyone likes sweeties and costumes.
But I don't like to think about people who are gone.
It makes me feel sad.
It can be sad to think about people that aren't here anymore.
But it can also make you happy to remember when they were here.
Like the way talking about your grandfather
makes Grandma so happy?
That's right! She's remembering him and so are we.
I thought this party could do with a little music.
I know just the song.
All aboard!
It's time to hop on the Roll Train.
Tonight's special guests include Upton and the Get Down Bunch,
Minnie Vanessa and the Hoods.
And now, here's your locomotive of locomotion,
everybody's favourite friend of funk, DJ Train Trax.
Wicka-wicka-woo-woo!
Hey, rollers and shakers, rockers and breakers.
Hey, Loose Caboose, how you feeling tonight?
I think I'm dying.
That sounds serious.
Yeah.
I'm dying to see tonight's star performer.
Well, let's get right to it then. Wicka-wicka-woo-woo!
Wicka-wicka-woo-woo!
You ready toÂ get down?
Oh, yeah!
Come on, Chrissy. Let's get down.
Try this one.
Oh, yeah!
Now, let's do the Truck Truck Caboose.
-Ready? -Ready.
I love the Truck Truck Caboose.
Okay, here comes the new one I made up.
Now, you try, Chrissy.
-Oh, yeah! -Oh, yeah!
Look at you two.
Look at those tyres move!
That's great.
Yeah, you got it.
What's that one called?
I don't know yet.
You two make a really great dance duo.
Dance with Cory!
So, do you think we'll win?
Are you kidding? With those moves?
You two are going to be great at the talent show.
Maybe I'll dust off the old keytar and play something from my rock opera.
You two are going to be great at the talent show.
Hey, what about me?
I'm just trying to save you from your crippling stage fright.
Right. I forgot about that.
Ready for the show, you two?
-Yeah. -Yeah.
Now what do we have to remember before any performance?
Go to the bathroom.
And...
If you play with fire, you're gonna get burned.
Not sure how that works for the talent show,
but yes. And...
Just have fun.
That's right.
Whoa!
Whoa is right. Looks like the whole town showed up.
-Come on, Chrissy. Let's go! -Oh, yeah.
They've got corn dogs over there.
What? No way.
I don't want to hear your exhaust running all night.
Welcome to theÂ Bumperton Hills 18th Annual Talent Show!
It's starting.
Please give it up for your humble host and 17-time winner,
Dr. Ethyl Wiperglass.
That's me.
Go, Dr. Wiperglass!
Let's hear it for our first contestant, Mrs. O'Tool.
Excuse me, Carsons.
You got this, babe.
Magnificent!
What has four wheels andÂ flies?
Me.
Get it? Me, a garbage truck.
-Wow! Everyone is really good. -Wow!
Finally, after 28 years of cleaning up messes,
a chance to sing.
There you are! Fenderson's called for you.
There's anÂ oil spill on aisle five.
That means you're next, Carsons.
-You ready? -I'm ready.
-Chrissy? -Ready.
Great!
Okay, we've got this.
Up next, Cory andÂ Chrissy Carson!
We got this.
-Okay, wish us luck. -Good luck!
I can't watch.
Oh, yeah!
You're doing great.
Okay, Chrissy, let's do the secret move I showed you.
-Yeah! Go, Chrissy!
Chrissy?
Ta-da!
Yes!
Okay, Chrissy, let's go.
The crowd loved it.
You two were great.
Thanks! Yeah! Good job, Chrissy.
Dance!
I think you're gonna have to show me how to do that move.
Let's thank all the contestants for their hard work today.
Great job, everyone.
But not everyone can be a winner...
or a 17-time winner.
The votes are in.
The winner is...
Cory andÂ Chrissy Carson!
We won!
Thank you! Thank you, everyone!
Congratulations, Cory.
And where's the star performer?
Star performer?
-Chrissy! Chrissy! Chrissy! -Go ahead.
Chrissy! Chrissy! Chrissy!
Okay, how about a group picture?
Cory, would you switch places with Chrissy? You're...
You're blocking the trophy.
Okay.
Now, everyone say, "17."
-Seventeen. -Seventeen.
A victory like this calls for some ice cream.
-Ice cream! -Yay!
Hey!
It's that Carson kid.
Hey, guys.
Yeah, it's really me.
What?
You were so cute.
Chrissy, can you show us that dance?
Hey, I could show it to you.
Yeah, you're the backup dancer, right?
No, actually--
Chrissy, you think you can do that dance for us?
I've got some music.Â Hit it!
Dance.
Come on, Chrissy. Go ahead.
Okay.
Hey, look! There she is! It's Chrissy!
Hey, check me out! I'm doing The Chrissy.
The Chrissy?
I'm going to make that kid a star.
Hey, Chrissy, do you know what a franchise is?
Good evening, Carsons.
Hi, Mr. Coaltrain.
Hey, I saw your dance.
Great job, Chrissy.
Actually, we're a dancing team.
Oops! What did I say?
I meant, "Good job, Carsons."
Yeah. Thanks.
You know I have a nephew who really likes to dance.
I think I'll tell him--
Don't mean to be rude, but it looks like I'm going left.
Good job at the show.
I love you, Chrissy! Bye!
Looks like you have a fan, Chrissy.
Finally home.
Papa, phone!
Just in time, too.
Everything all right, sweetie?
Hi, Mama.
Yeah, everything's great.
Great, huh?
Well, it's just...
How come everyone likes Chrissy so much?
Why don't I have any fans?
Honey, I'm your fan.
That doesn't count.
What? Sure, it does.
I just mean everyone's cheering for Chrissy.
It's like I wasn't even there.
Cory, Chrissy didn't take anything away from you.
She just wanted to have fun with you, and you guys won together.
It was kind of fun.
There's that smile.
Besides, it was just a silly little talent show.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Did you eat those corn dogs?
Yes.
But that's not why my engine is racing.
Mr. Coaltrain just called, he sent the video to his nephew.
-So? -So?
"So?" So...
his nephew is... DJ--
DJ Train Trax.
Chrissy, you said I could tell them.
-What? -What?
DJ Train Trax? What did he say?
He said he loved your dance.
He loved it so much he wants you to be on his show.
Roll Train is coming to Bumperton Hills.
Wicky-wicky-woo-woo!
What a day!
All right, kids, it's time to get ready for bed.
No!
Hey, get back here, you little dance machine.
I'm gonna dance for DJ Train Trax.
Time to grab the newspaper and see what that old Carmaduke is up to.
Hey, my dance made the front page!
BUMPERTON BUGLE
"The Chrissy is the best dance ever."
"The Chrissy"?
Mama!
Chrissy, have some waffle, not just the syrup.
Chrissy!
Whatever.
Morning, Cory. Want some syrup?
No thanks, Papa.
Has anybody seen Mama?
-Morning, sleepyhead. -Hey, Frannie.
Frannie! What are you doing here?
Frannie wanted to treat us to a little business presentation over breakfast.
It's been very impressive so far.
Thanks, Mrs. C.
Now, if you'll point your attention towards thisÂ very professional graph I made,
the redÂ squiggly line indicates
the dance has been skyrocketing in popularity since last night.
With approval ratings like this... Well... can you say college fund?
I like the sound of that.
-Would you like some more to eat, sweetie? -No, thanks. I'm stuffed.
I couldn't eat another bite of your delicious cooking.
Besides, we don't really have any time if we're gonna make it to the Roll Train commercial shoot.
Roll TrainÂ commercial shoot?
Do you think DJ Train Trax is gonna be there?
I wouldn't doubt it, sweetheart.
It's notÂ Roll Train without the DJ.
Okay, everyone, let'sÂ roll out.
Let's go, kids.
-Come on, Chrissy. -Come on. Let's go.
This is so exciting.
I can't wait to meet DJ Train Trax.
Oh, no.
ROLL TRAINÂ FT. THE CHRISSY "The Chrissy"?
Maybe they haven't finished adding your name
to the giant sign in the middle of town.
Yeah.
I'm sure it's a work in progress.
I don't know. "The Chrissy" is spelled so big there isn't room for "Cory."
I mean, look at it.
I bet you could see it from the highway.
Hey, why don't we go inside?
Roll Train!
Cory, you coming?
Mama, we did the dance together.
Why are they calling it The Chrissy?
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.
Maybe we can go talk to someone to getÂ this all straightened out.
Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
Okay.
Check this out.
Roll Train.Â This is amazing!
It's really Roll Train. This is so cool!
This is all for you, my superstar.
Okay, guys, can we go tell somebody about the thing now?
Tell somebody about what thing?
Oh, my gosh! It's Loose Caboose. Wow! You're really famous.
And really, really adorable.
I wish I could squeeze your cheek, but I won't... unless you want me to.
I'm cool.
Papa, don't you have something you wanna talk to the caboose about?
Right! Can you please sign my bumper sticker?
No! Mama, remember? The thing we were going to tell them.
Of course! There's been a little mix-up.
I'd like you to meet my two children, Cory and Chrissy.
Mama!
Whoops! Sorry. I'm a little nervous.
This is the one that came up with the dance.
Of course Chrissy came up with the dance. That's why it's called The Chrissy.
No, that's not right.
So you didn't come up with the dance? This one did. Congrats!
No, no, no.
What we're trying to say is that Cory is the one--
Here he comes.
ROLL TRAIN
Wickita-wickita-wickita-wickita-wickita- woo-woo!
Never gets old!
Yeah, the platform works.
Great job, everybody.
It's going to be a great show.
DJ Train Trax!
Yo! What a radical-looking group of groovy cars we have over here!
My name is DJ Train Trax. Nice to meet you all.
My name is Cory, Cory Carson. I'm your biggest fan ever.
Right on, little dude.
And we're the Carson family. I'm Mama. This is Papa.
And I think I already know who this little lady is.
You must be Chrissy Carson.
Your dance is really groovy stuff.
Mr. Trax, there's something I wanted to tell you.
And I'm Frannie Fenderson of Frannie Fenderson Talent Agency.
Chrissy here is one of my most promising clients.
Nice! Glad to see this little superstar is in good hands.
We got big plans. We're gonna actually take her global.
Actually, that reminds me. There's a thing I wanted to tell you.
Okay, sure.
There you are.
Chrissy and Cory, we've got a commercial shoot to do.
We need to get started. Let's get you guys against that backdrop.
Right this way.
-Mr. Trax? -What is it, little man?
Hey, Trax, we needÂ to rehearse the opening routine one more time.
We'll talk later, little guy. Stay groovy.
Cory! What's the holdup, kiddo?
We've got magic to make.
Come on!
Roll Train! Cory, dance!
That's great, Chrissy.
I can see why she's the star.
Cory, try and lookÂ like you're having fun.
Smile for the camera, sweetie.
That's somehow worse.
Maybe smile less.
I'm sensing a serious lack of grooviness over here.
You can't dance without someÂ jams.
Oh, yeah! Crispy!
That's it. You're feeling it!
Try a reverse 180 groove slide.
That's it! Get into it!
Looking great, kids.
Yeah, this is great.
And cut. Great job, everybody. I think we got everything we need, right?
Yeah.
That was amazing, Chrissy.
The camera loves you. You were born to be a star.
Good work, guys! I'll see you two at the show.
Wait! DJ Train Trax?
Hey, what's up?
The dance, it's my dance. I came up with it.
Yeah, little man, I know.
You know?
Yeah, you and your sister did a great job coming up with it.
Thank you.
But what I mean is it's not really The Chrissy.
Trax, we need you for the meeting.
Hey, little man, I gotta go, but nice work.
Can't wait to see The Chrissy on the show.
But...
It's my dance.
Hey, Cory! Time is money, baby. Let's roll out.
Pretty impressive, huh?
-Cool! -Sure is a lot of stuff.
I like it.
Chrissy!
We've got it all: bumper stickers, mugs, key chains, air fresheners,
those littleÂ handle things for eating corn on the cob.
Collectables!
It's me.
Where's mine?
Look behind you.
Plungers?
I'm a plunger?
We had to diversify the product line,
and the resemblance is kind of uncanny.
This has gone too far.
I have to find a way to win back my dance move.
Your dance move?
Yeah, you know.
You mean The Chrissy.
That's what I'm talking about!
Too bad you can't come up with a better dance move.
My Aunt Susan is a great dancer,
and she invented upwards of four different moves.
Wait. Say that again.
-My Aunt Susan-- -No, before that.
-You mean The Chrissy? -No, after that.
Never mind. I know what I have to do.
I'm going to invent a new dance move called The Cory,
and it will be the greatest dance of all time!
And I'll make a healthy snack.
Cory?
Are you okay?
Okay. What about this one? Ready?
Ready.
Don't blink, or you'll miss it.
I won't blink.
Okay, here it is.
Ta-da!
Well, I've never seen anything like it before.
It's not very good.
Hey, it's a work in progress.
Why don't you try doing this?
Oh, yeah. You got it.
Yeah, and move your tyres like this.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah, that's good.
Try wiggling a little bit more.
Now, spin around.
Faster!
Hey, this feels good. What do you think, Freddie?
Well...
I'm doing The Chrissy, aren't I?
Yeah.
It looked good, though.
Come on, Freddie. Time to kick it up a notch.
Yes!
That's it!
Come over here, everybody. Cory's got a new dance.
Oh, yeah!
That was amazing!
I loved what you were doing with your tyres.
That's my friend!
-Go, Cory! -Go, Cory!
Way to go, Cory!
You did it!
Dance with Cory.
I've never seen anything like that. What is that called?
The Cory.
Introducing our first guest.
He's from a small town but has some big talent.
Give it up for...
Cory Carson performing his new dance,
The Cory.
Oh, yeah! It's The Cory.
That was star-tastic! Can we see that again?
Oh, no, I couldn't possibly. It'd be too much.
But if you insist!
Dance with Cory.
Chrissy, what are you doing?
I need to practice.
Chrissy-Cory dance.
What?
Chrissy, stop.
Chrissy!
What? No! Chrissy!
That's my dance. You're not allowed to take it.
You already took The Chrissy. You aren't taking this one, too.
Cory dance with Chrissy?
No, Chrissy. I want to dance alone.
No more dance?
Can't sleep?
Nope.
I was just getting a snack.
Thanks, Mama.
So, you excited about the show tomorrow?
Yeah, totally.
Cory, I'm sorry this week hasn't gone the way you hoped it would,
but I just want you to know I'm really proud of you.
Really?
Your papa and I are so excited to see you dance on Roll Train tomorrow.
And what are we supposed to remember before any performance?
Just have fun.
So tomorrow...
just have fun, okay?
Okay, I will.
Now, try to get some sleep.
Okay, Mama.
That girl loves dancing with her big brother.
Thanks for being such a good one, Cory.
Good night.
ROLL TRAIN FT. THE CHRISSY
Perfect.
-I can't wait to see this. -I have all of their bumper stickers.
I loveÂ Roll Train.
-She's the best dancer ever. -Ever.
Best seat in the house.
Sorry. Bit of a wide load here. Coming through.
Thanks, Dad.
Hey, down in front.
Carsons, you're here.
Hi, Caboose.
Follow me.
Looks pretty good all lit up, huh?
-How we doing, Phil? -No fires yet.
Cory, we're going to have you on the lower platform.
-Go ahead, Cory. -Okay.
Chrissy,
we'll have you up here on the star platform.
Right next to you know who.
And on DJ Train Trax's cue, you'll be lifted up into superstardom.
We're live in two minutes, Caboose.
Positions. Positions, everyone.
Two minutes till showtime, folks. Let's go. Positions.
-Ready? -Ready.
No.
What's wrong, Chrissy?
No more dance.
That's a good one, Chrissy.
Come on. It's dance time.
No more dance!
Yo!
What's the commotion over here?
It's Chrissy.
I'm not sure she wants to do the dance, DJ.
I see.
I don't understand what could have happened.
We couldn't get her toÂ stop dancing just yesterday.
Hey, little lady, it's okay. Everyone gets nervous.
We'd hate to do the show without you. Are you sure you don't want to do the dance with us?
No more dance.
-All right, that's fine by me. -That's cool.
But we really can't do The Chrissy without Chrissy. It will be just the The.
That's why we're changing it.
We're doing The Cory,
represented by Frannie Fenderson Talent Agency.
I thought you worked for Chrissy.
I don't follow the puck, Mr. Trax. I head wherever the puck is going to be.
Wait. What's the plan exactly?
Rebranding.
Did you know my boy Cory here has his own dance called The Cory?
I've seen it. It's even better than The Chrissy.
That true, Cory?
Did you really come up with your own dance?
Well, yeah, I did.
Bingo!
Cory, my man, are you okay to do the dance alone?
Yeah, I can dance alone.
Chrissy, where you going, honey?
I'm sorry about all this.
Please, it's fine. We've got this.
Cory, you okay?
Yeah, Mama.
We'll be watching.
Okay, everyone, we are doing The Cory. I repeat. We are doing The Cory.
Change it to "The Cory." Okie dokie.
Rolling and... action!
All aboard! It's time to hop on the Roll Train.
We've got a great show lined up for you tonight.
If you're in Bumperton Hills, this is the place to be.
Give it up for the Roll Train Locomotions!
Don't get emotional, kid.
You're about to get everything you everÂ wanted,
and I will get 10% of everything you ever wanted.
-What? -Nothing.
Pop a tyre out there, Cory.
You ready, little man?
Yeah, I think so.
Great! I'll do theÂ intro, and then my brother will send you up.
Your brother?
Yeah, you know, that guy.
Phil? Phil is your brother?
No. No. That guy.
Let's get camera four ready for DJ's intro.
The Loose Caboose is your brother?
Sure is.
He's a good one, too.
wouldn't be up here if it wasn't for him.
The dance moves, the catchphrases...
the wicky-wicky-woo-woo...
he came up with all that.
-Really? -Yeah.
He even came up with the nameÂ Roll Train.
I wanted to call the show Funky Dance Time.
-That's horrible. -I know.
I owe a lot to him. The best part of this show...
is that we get to do it together.
Yeah.
Now, here's your locomotive of locomotion, everybody's favorite friend of funk...
-That's my cue. -...DJ Train Trax.
Just remember: there's no wrong way to dance as long as you're having fun.
See youÂ  up there, Cory.
Wicky-wicky-woo-woo!
Give it up one more time for the Roll Train Locomotions!
Now, it's time to introduce a very special guest from Bumperton Hills!
And back to DJ Train Trax.
Well, let's get right to it then. Chrissy.
Yeah!
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Cory Carson
performing his new signature dance move, The Cory.
Cut to commercial.
We'll be right back.
Love my natural spring water.
Chrissy?
-Chrissy, sweetie! -Come on out, Chrissy.
Chrissy!
Cory, what are you doing here?
Where's Chrissy?
She's still a bit camera shy. We can't get her to come out.
Do you think I could try talking to her?
Okay, people, this is not a drill. We are at Defcon derailed.
Caboose, what do we do? We can't find the kids anywhere.
I don't know. This is a huge mess.
Did someone say "mess"?
I've been cleaning up messes for 28 years.
Who are you?
Chrissy.
Chrissy?
I'm sorry, Chrissy.
I got so caught up with being a good dancer
I stopped being a good brother.
This whole thing was supposed to be fun.
But... it's no fun without you.
Remember this one?
I call this one TheÂ Chris-ory.
I call this move The Chrissy Cory Chrissy-cross.
Cory?
Cory Train Trax.
I'm sorry, Chrissy.
Let's go home.
No.
Dance with Cory.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay, then. Let's get down.
Coming through.
Trax, Trax, this guy said he used to be a singer.
I think it's our only option at this point.
Right on.
Finally!
THE CORY
We're changing "The Cory" to "The Janitor."
Okay, this is where you'll be.
Better take your position, Trax. You, follow me.
You really saved our caboose.
Here it is.
We're here.
Where have you been?
I didn't want to go on without my sister,
but I talked to her, and we're ready to go on together.
That's great, little man.
So, what dance are we doing?
The Chrissy.
THE JANITOR
-Change it back to "The Chrissy." -Change it yourself. I quit.
Hey!
Where are you going? There's room up here for you too.
Yeah.
Really?
We're on in ten.
Ten seconds! Ten seconds, everyone!
Hey, Cory, nice job.
With the dance?
Nah. For being a groovy older brother.
Thanks, DJ Train Trax.
-Ready? -Ready.
Wicka-wicka-woo-woo!
Welcome back toÂ Roll Train.
Next up, we've got quite the treat for you.
A voice ofÂ satin, a heart of gold,
a groovy mustache that doesn't get old.
Give it up for...
this guy!
The stars shine brighter together
What if you and I were together?
It's like listening to an angel.
'Cause I believe in you
And if you believe in me too
There's nothing that we cannot achieve
When we're together
And now, Cory and Chrissy Carson performing The Chrissy.
All right, Bumperton Hills!
Let's get down!
Come on!
Let's get this party started!
Kimmy on theÂ Roll Train. Timmy on the Roll Train.
-Everybody get on this stage! -Oh, yeah! Wicky-wicky-woo-woo!
-Care to dance, Mama? -Oh, my!
It's all about the wipers, baby!
Come on, Freddie. Let's get this train rolling.
Mom, you gotta move your tyres like this.
Go ahead, Caboose. Cut it loose!
Oh, yeah, that's my brother.
The Chrissy! The Chrissy! The Chrissy!
Here's my card.
Give me a call if you wanna talk about your future.
Yeah, let's get it, y'all!
Hurry up, this way!
Slow down, Cory.
We finally made it.
The smell of nature and friendship.
Truck. Caboose!
Hey! Come back! I'm going to get you! Hey, no flying!
Help! I'm gonna fall!
Oh. I'm okay.
This wall totallyâ€¦ rocks!
Yay! Camp Friendship!
Wow, nothing's changed!
Hey, Carson. Welcome back.
Hey, Rory!
Hey, Cory.
-Carley. -It's so good to see you again.
Back to be happy my.
-What? -D'oh!
I'm happy you're back too, Cory. Come on, follow me.
I'm happy you're back too, Cory. Come on, follow me. Let's do a refresher tour.
Okay.
-First stop is our mess hall. -They've got corn dogs over there.
Oh, me and Freddie made bacon towers here last year.
Oh, no!
I guess that's why they call it the mess hall.
I guess that's why they call it the mess hall. Good one, Carley.
This is where we had our end-of-camp bonfire last year.
Kimmy, Timmy, that's not for firewood.
Fine.
Cory, when you go on a hike,
make sure you stay on our special summer camp paths.
-What about that other path? -Oh, you can't go on that path.
What happens if you do?
Oh, well, you go to jail for that.
-What? -What?
Just kidding! But it's important you don't break the rules.
And finally, the most important rule of Camp Friendship is to be a good friend.
Yeah.
Yay, Camp Friendship! Here's your tent, Cory.
Tent number two! The same one me and Freddie had last year.
Camp!
Here's your stuff, kiddo.
Thanks, Mummy.
Here's me and Freddie winning the six-wheeled race last summer.
And here's us at the end-of-camp bonfire singing the Camp Friendship song!
Sounds pretty lit.
Oh! And this one's of us at Firefly Cave.
Firefly Cave?
Yeah, it's this cool cave that Freddie and I found,
where you can catch tons of fireflies.
Oh, lightning in a bottle.
But Firefly Cave is a secret just between me and Freddie so no snitching.
Okay. Our lips are sealed.
Well, I hope you and Freddie have a wonderful time together, honey.
Chrissy, time to go, honey.
Chrissy camp too.
Chrissy.
All right, Cory, call us if you need anything.
-Love you! Bye! -Bye!
Bye! Now, let's see.
Where do I start?
Looking good. Now all that's left is for Freddie to arrive.
Well, if it isn't my best friend-- Frannie?
Hi, Cory. Can you make some room for me?
Okay, let's put the massage chair over there,
hang my humidifier on the back wall,
and the mini fridge will have to go under the bed.
Frannie, what are you doing here?
I'm camping, Cory.
Careful with that TV!
-Please? -Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
No, I mean this isn't your tent.
Is this tent number two?
Yeah.
Well, then it's my tent.
But I'm supposed to room with Freddie.
I saw him driving into tent number six if you don't believe me.
Hey! Turn on the TV! The Miles of Our Lives marathon is starting.
Thank you.
Six?
Freddie? Freddie!
Freddie, I-- Huh?
Oh, hey! Can I help you?
Oh, my gosh. Sorry. I must have had the... wrong... tent.
Cory!
Freddie!
Gosh, how long has it been, buddy?
Too long! Summer hasn't been the same without you.
We have so much stuff to catch up on!
And so much stuff to do together!
-Now that you're here. -And now that you're here!
I missed you, buddy.
Me too, buddy.
Hey, did you bring the stuff for... Firefly Cave?
Of course!
Cool. Check this out.
Hey, guys.
Coast is clear.
We're gonna catch so many fireflies this summer.
-Hey, guys, whatcha looking at? -Nothing.
Wait, you guys haven't met. Cory, this is my cousin Rosie.
Hi, Cory.
It's her first time at camp. We're gonna be tentmates together.
You're sharing your tent with her?
Yep. She's gonna hang out with us for all of camp.
Doesn't that sound great, Cory?
Great.
I just hope we don't run into anyâ€¦ fire hydrants!
Fire hydrants!
Cory, you see, this one time, we were drivingâ€¦ and there's this fire hydrant--
Freddie, you have to tell him the part where Aunt Susan--
Oh, right! So we were celebrating my aunt Susan's 60th birthday.
She had six scoops of ice cream on her plate.
Okay.
And she started talking to this... fire hydrant.
It was an outdoor party.
-Okay. -And it was...
-Okay. -And it was... yellow!
Wait, what?
Yellow! Sorry, I guess you had to be there.
Camp Friendship friends. Please report to the field.
Time to get going. Let's get the camp fun started, Rosie.
You said it, yellow fire hydrant!
Rosie, you're too much!
So, looks like Freddie's got a new friend.
It's fine. Everybody knows I'm Freddie's camp buddy.
Yeah, sure. Keep telling yourself that, Carson.
Who's ready for camp activity?
Camp activity!
Freddie, I think I got one!
Freddie, I think I got one! -Cool! Nice one! -Look, I caught a fish!
-I caught it! Look at my fish! -Oh my gosh!
-It's bigger than Aunt Susan! -It's the biggest fish in the lake.
And when she opened her trunk,  it was empty!
On your marks, get set, go!
Cory, slow down!
Cory!
We won! We won,Â Frannie! We won!
Oh, my gosh! Are you okay, Freddie?
Yeah! Did you see how you tripped,
and I tripped one and then we both tripped?
I know. It was hilarious.
Hey, Cory! You ready for tomorrow?
-Tomorrow? -Yeah! Firefly Cave?
-You still want to go? -Yes, I've been waiting all summer for it.
-Haven't you? -Yeah! It'll be just like last year.
-It's gonna be the best! -Best!
I can't wait to catch fireflies too!
Wait. Wha-- Huh?
Yeah, I forgot to tell you. Rosie's gonna join us tomorrow.
What? Why?
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone. I promise.
It'll be so much fun. Just the three of us.
Oh, yeah. The-- the three of us.
Well, I better get going.
Okay. I guess I'll see you tomorrow morning?
Yeah, sounds good.
-See you then! -Bye, Cory.
Eh, good enough for me.
Previously, on Miles of Our Lives.
Sorry, Fernando. I can't hang out today.
I promised my new friend Roger we'd go to the mall.
Not the mall!
I hope you don't mind. You'll be okay on your own, won't you?
Replace me, will ya? I'll just have toâ€¦ split them up.
Split them up?
Cory! Are you ready forâ€¦ "you know what"?
Split them up.
What'd you say?
Oh, nothing. Where's Freddie?
Oh, he's brushing his teeth.
Hey, I just had an idea.
I love ideas.
Well, great. Come on.
I was thinking you should run ahead and surprise Freddie by catching a bunch of fireflies.
and surprise Freddie by catching a bunch of fireflies.
-Really? -Yeah, Freddie would love it.
Oh, okay.
Great. Just stay to the left, and you can't miss it.
Wait, isn't this path off limits?
Nah, it's fine. That's just how you get to Firefly Cave.
Okay.
Well, great. And remember, don't tell anybody about Firefly Cave. Promise?
I promise. Okay, I'll see you guys there.
Hey, Cory... You're a good friend.
Yeah, thanks.
Juicy stuff is happening here, Cory!
Cory! Hey, have you seen Rosie anywhere?
Ohâ€¦ Yeah.
She just... went to put some air in her tyres.
She told us to go on ahead. I gave her directions.
Cool beans.Â Do you have theâ€¦ "you know what"?
And you got the--?
Oh, yeah.
Woohoo! Let's go!
Camp Friendship Friendship through and through
I'll always be best friends with you
We all sit down, go round and round -Best friends are always there -Ready?
-Best friends are always there -Ready? Go!
Friendship, friendship's in the air
Friendship, friendship's in the air -Freddie? -Friendliest camp anywhere
You need a tyre, I've got a spare A friend will always care
Camp Friendship, we love you
Camp Friendship, we love you!
I spy with my little eye... something green!
-Is it that tree? -Nope!
Is it that tree? Nope!
-That one? -Nope!
-That one? -Nope. -That one? -Nope.
That one? Nope.
Now I spy... something yellow!
Firefly Cave! It's just like I remember it.
Whoa!
Are you ready to catch some fireflies?
Yeah. Uh, shouldn't we wait for Rosie?
What? Why? Firefly Cave is our thing.
I'm just trying to be a good friend.
I thought we were friends.
What? We are.
Then how come we haven't hung out all week?
What are you talking about? We're hanging out now.
Only because Rosie didn't show up.
Yeah, I wonder what's taking her so long.
Really?
What? She's my cousin, and she's never been camping before.
You're acting weird. I'm gonna go and find Rosie.
Freddie, wait.
Freddie, wait up! Freddie!
-Oh, man. She's in so much trouble. -Maybe she didn't know.
Huh?
What are they talking about?
She broke the rules.
-I found her off the Camp Friendship path. -Rosie!
Where were you heading to, Rosie?
I... I promised I wouldn't say.
What?
Rosie, if you don't tell us the truth,
you'll be in even bigger trouble than you already are.
Carley, go set her up on cleaning duty.
Let's go, Rosie.
But that's not fair. She'll miss the bonfire!
I'm sorry, Freddie.
Wait! Rory, wait! It's my fault.
It's-- It's all my fault.
What are you talking about, little fellow?
Well, Freddie and I found a secret cave last year,
and I made Rosie promise not to tell anyone about it.
A secret cave? Off camp property?
No, it's behind the field, but I didn't want Rosie to go,
so-- so I sent her down the wrong path.
What?
Why would you do that, Cory?
I... I...
I...
I thought she was taking my best friend away.
What?
Come on, Cory.
You're off the hook, Rosie, but stay on the right path.
Yes, sir.
Cory, wait. I didn't mean to take Freddie from you.
Hey, Freddie.
Rosie, are you okay?
Yeah... Cory gave me this.
His... firefly net?
Friends are always there
Always there! Camp Friendship
Oh, man!
You need a tyre, I've got a spare Oh, man.
Oh, where did you come from, little guy? Hey! Cool, you guys are so cute.
Hey! Cool, you guys are so cute. Whoa!
-Pretty nice, huh? -Freddie?
If you can't go to Firefly Cave, then Firefly Cave comes to you.
This is so cool.
I'm sorry for being a bad friend, Freddie.
Cory, while I don't condone your actions, I understand why you actioned them.
You know, we're still friends, Cory. We'll always be friends.
Thanks, Freddie.
You ready to catch some fireflies?
Yeah! How did you catch all these anyway?
Oh... Rosie helped.
Oh, yeah. Where is she?
Well, I thought maybe you'd want to hang out just you and me for a bit?
The only thing is... it might be hard to catch all these fireflies
without someone really fast.
Look over there! Cory, on your right!
There's one behind you!
-Those cobweb decorations look great! -Cobweb decorations?
Those aren't decorations, honey.
We should clean more.
Are you sure it's going to be OK for Chrissy to trick-or-treat without us?
Of course. Cory and Freddie will take good care of her.
But it's Halloween. It's so spooky out there.
I'm a vampire!
-Boo! -Boo!
Oh, Chrissy. That ghost costume looks so real. Very scary!
That ghost costume looks so real. Very scary!
I'll get it. You just go drink a glass of water and calm down.
Beep, zorp. Hello, Mrs. Earthling Carson.
Oh, Freddie! You look adorable!
Thanks! Check this out!
Beep, boop.
Cory's got to see this.
Cory! Come look at Freddie's costume!
Coming!
It's kinda hard to see where I'm going
when I'm making my DJ Train Trax face.
I dunno how he does that all day.
Nice, Cory! Your costume turned out so good!
Yeah, it looks great.
I mean... greetings, Earth train.
Please teach me what it means to boogie a woogie.
My groovy space dude, that's a dance you do from your heart!
Which one? I have three.
Ready for all the sweets we're gonna get tonight?
Ready? Does this look like the face of someone who isn't ready?
Don't get so excited about sweets that you forget to take Chrissy.
Sweeties!
Of course! I'd never forget about her. She's gonna help carry my sweets!
Do you remember our rule for tonight?
Keep Chrissy safe!
Oh, right! I knew that.
Now let's go get some sweeties.
Hola! Who's there?
Trick or treat!
Oh, how nice! I guess it's Halloween today.
Carmina, do we have anything we can give trick-or-treaters?
OK, here we go. Some nice treats to keep away the tricks.
Nice!
-This doesn't look like sweets. -It's bread! Take as much as you like!
Treats!
Thanks?
Trick or treat!
Oh, wow! Great costumes, everybody!
Thanks, Carley! You too! You look really scary.
I'm not wearing a costume.
Trick or treat?
I'm giving out trading cards for the Backstreet Buses! Take your pick.
That middle one looks just like me!
Don't you think?
Sure, Freddie.
Trick or treat!
Hi, Rory!
Hey, everybody. Wow! Nice costumes!
They deserve an extra special treat.
One for each of you.
Whatâ€¦ are those supposed to be?
I made dolls out of recycled things from work.
Because being wasteful is theâ€¦ spookiest thing of all!
Oh, cool.
Man, these houses stink!
Well, his name is Rory Rubbish.
No! I mean, we've gone to all these houses and haven't gotten a good treat!
Where do I need to go to get some sweeties?
Cory, look!
That's amazing!
Oh, nice costume!
Yeah, you too.
Thanks! Happy Halloween!
What costume was that supposed to be?
DJ Train Trax.
No!
What is it? Do you smell something?
-Treats! Yum! -Treats?
-Treats! -Where are the treats, Chrissy?
A King-size chocolate bar wrapper!
Wait! I think this is Frannie's house. Frannie! Open up!
What do you want?
Oh, I was wondering if you wanted to share any of your sweets.
-I saw the wrapper and-- -Yeah, wrappers.
-I saw the wrapper and-- -Yeah, wrappers. All I got is wrappers.
Frannie, wait!
I was obsessed, Cory. I wanted that King-size chocolate bar so bad
that I lost track. Lost track of what really mattered. Quit, Cory! Quit before it's too late!
Lost track of what really mattered. Quit, Cory! Quit before it's too late!
What? I just want sweets. What are you talking about?
Just won't let it go, will you?
You know how the scariest houses always have the best treats?
Imagine just how scary a place has to be to give out a King-size chocolate bar.
It was the scariest thing I've ever seen. But if I really can't convince you,
everything you need to know is up on the wall.
A map of Bumperton!
That must be where the King-size chocolate bars are!
Looks like it's on the other side of town.
-Come on! Let's go and get that chocolate. -Chocolate!
Just don't say I didn't warn you.
Cory! Are you sure about this?
I'm sure. What's the big deal? We only have a little further to go.
I don't know. Looks like a lot further to me.
Well, looks like we'd better get going before they're all gone!
King-size chocolate Oh, that King-size chocolate
It's not small, it's really, really big
It's really, really big!
-King-size chocolate! -Chocolate!
I'm pretty sure the map said it would be just up ahead.
I think this is it!
Pumpkin!
OK, we made it. Now, let's go.
Yeah, let's go.
That's not what I meant!
Welcome, all ye who dare enter
the haunted corn maze!
Hi! Are you the person we talk to to get King-size chocolate bars?
Ah, a brave-looking boy!
Ye seeking the bar of kings, ye be.
First, ye must pass all the challenges ye see!
Enter the corn if you dare!
Sorry, sometimes it gets stuck.
There we go.
I want myâ€¦
Mummy!
Cool!
-Remember we said we'd keep Chrissy safe? -Pumpkin!
She seems fine to me. Now, let's go.
-Cory, do you even know which way to go? -Of course!
-Cory, do you even know which way to go? -Of course! Here we turnâ€¦
Right!
Right! That's what I was gonna say.
It's just a candy cone. We'll just go the otherâ€¦
That wasn't there before, right?
I don't think so.
Cory!
Hey!
I'm coming!
-That was a close one. -See? I told you I'd keep you safe.
Safe!
As long as we stick together, there's nothing we can'tâ€¦
Welcome!
I'm Phil the Spider!
Let us through, Phil!Â  We're gonna get the King-size chocolate bar!
If you want to pass, you must first answer my riddle.
Oh! My mum loves riddles.
Bring it on!
Very well. In the mouth, I am chopped.Â  Chop!
At the movies, I am popped. Pop!
In this maze, I was born.
At the market, I am what?
Corn? It's definitely corn, right?
What?
Impossible! I spent years thinking of that riddle!
It was kind of easy.
Corn!
Very well. As promised.
Hooray!
-Yay! -Bye, Phil!
OK, see you guys later.
Now it is I who must be riddled.
Look, we're almost there!
King-size chocolate bar, here weâ€¦
What theâ€¦
-Cory, I think we should head back now. -No, we're in too deep, Freddie.
Get behind me!
What? OK!
-Wait for it! -Cory!
Duck!
Great job! Tell your friends!
How did you know?
Know what? We've got keep moving. Come on.
-I think it's right up this way. -Cory, wait up!
Sweeties!
Cory, look!
There it is! The King-size chocolate bar!
Wait! Cory, it's a red light! Red means don't go!
What are you waiting for?
This place is giving me the creeps, Cory!
All right.
I bet it tastes king-sized.
It even smells king-sized!
Come on, Cory! Just grab it and go!
Relax, Freddie. It's not like there's anyoneâ€¦
here?
Take that! You think you're so scary?
Can you believe we actually got it?
Isn't it beautiful?
Yeah! It's pretty shiny!
What do you think, Chrissy? Should we eat it now, or save it forâ€¦
What do you think, Chrissy? Should we eat it now, or save it forâ€¦ later?
Chrissy?
Chrissy? Wait, where's Chrissy?
Cory, Freddie!
Hi, Chrissy.
Wiperglass!
-Remember your appointment on Tuesday. -Tuesday!
I haven't got any sweets, but I think I've got marshmallow treats inside.
Marshmallows!
Oh, I love Halloween!
Chrissy!
Well, gotta go!
Come on, Freddie. We're going in.
Chrissy!
Oh no!
Freddie, don't scare me like that!
Sorry, Cory.
Chrissy?
Boo!
Boo! This movie was horrible!
Stay tuned for my scathing review!
Where is it?
I know I had a bag of marshmallow treats somewhere.
Now I remember! It's in here.
Did you hear that?
Sounds like Chrissy!
What horrible things that monster must be doing to her.
Look at you go!
Marshmallows!
Now, that one looks like you, Freddie.
Really?
Well, you are one happy-looking ghost.
Halloween is so fun. All the happy children.
Come and look at my special pumpkin stew I've been making.
Pretty!
Smells good, too, doesn't it?
Cory, look!
The monster's gonna cook Chrissy!
I think it needs more nutmeg. Chrissy, could you grab me some?
Thanks, Chrissy. It's on the bottom shelf.
I had one job tonight.
Keep Chrissy safe.
Keep Chrissy safe!
Wait! Come on, Freddie. Be brave.
Be the brave alien!
Hey, monster!
Oh! Hello!
Let Chrissy go!
Chrissy!
Oh, my stew!
Oh no! We're too late!
She's gone. She's dissolved. She's nothing but soup now.
Chrissy!
Boo!
-Chrissy! You're alive! -Or is it her ghost?
It doesn't matter! Run, Chrissy! Run for your life!
Monster, don't eat us!
Wait. You didn't get any treats.
There. That should hold.
-Wait! Have some treats! -This way!
Wait! Children, the treats!
There it is. Hey! Open the gate!
Hey, open the gate!
Hurry!
Mister! Mister, open up! OK!
Oh, drat. It's stuck again!
Whoopsies, that's not good.
Oh no! Look, it's broken! What do we do?
Just go for it!
Scary!
We made it!
Chrissy!
Cory, help!
Treats! Have some treats! Come back!
-Oh no! -Wait!
The monster's gonna eat Chrissy!
Why is this happening?
You must have some treats!
It's all 'cause of this dumb old chocolate bar.
That's it!
Cory, if you do that, the chocolate bar will get crushed!
I know, Freddie. I know.
Careful, Cory!
-Cory! -Wait.
Cory, be careful!
Chrissy! Come on!
Chrissy!
No!
Run!
Hurry!
-Could you open the door, please? -Yeah.
-Could you open the door, please? -Yeah. Just give me a minute.
Do hurry. Those poor kids didn't get any treats. They must be starving.
No kid should be empty-handed on Halloween. Treats for all!
Bro--
Forget it, bro. It's Bumperton.
A glass of water really does help you calm down.
It's just the kids, honey.
Right.
Oh man!
Welcome back. Did you have fun?
Yeah. It was great.
How about you, Chrissy? Did Cory keep you safe?
Chrissy safe!
So, how many sweets did you all get?
Marshmallows?
Marshmallows?
Marshmallows!
Good load, Chrissy!
Hey, since you've been such good trick-or-treaters,
what do you think about going to a spooky corn maze?
is the Honkin' Henry Extreme.
Batteries not included, so please send some.
It comes in an assortment of colours, and really, any colour will do,
but to be honest,Â I like orange the best.
I'm not sure why.
Love, Cory Carson.
-There. -Cory?
Christmas is three days away. Those cookies will get stale.
I know! I'm just so excited about getting the Honkin' Henry Extreme!
I want macaroni, please!
Well, we'll see what Santa brings.
-Did you hear that? -Let's go check it out.
What happened?
You crashed into our garden. Where were you headed?
Well, I was headed straight toâ€¦
toâ€¦
toâ€¦
I don't remember where.
Do you have an address we could look up?
I can't seem to remember that either.
You've got a big dent.
You must've hit your head.
-We better get you inside for now. -Good idea.
Thanks for letting me stay, but I should really be getting back toâ€¦
somewhere.
-Nonsense. Stay as long as you need. -I'll find some blankets.
Why does he look so familiar?
Hello there!
Hi!
And who might you be?
My name's Cory.
Hello, Cory, my name'sâ€¦
It'sâ€¦
-Well, I don't really remember my name. -Yum.
-Well, I don't really remember my name. -Yum. Cookies!
Chrissy! We're supposed to be saving those forâ€¦
Santaâ€¦
Santa Cars is in my house!
Excuse us for a second. Come on,Â Chrissy.
Chrissy! It's Santa Cars.
Santa? Where?
In the living room. Look.
Those kids.
Daddy?
No, not Daddy! The other guy.
-I've got your blankets. -Why, thank you.
That's not Santa.
Look closer.
Hey, maybe you left your wallet in your back.
Good thinking.
Where did these presents come from?
-Santa! -I can't remember.
Macaroni, please.
OK, Chrissy. Time for bed.
Macaroni!
Hey. I've got something for you.
Something for me?
Yeah, here you go.
Thank you, Cory.
This is a very nice envelope. Sorry I don't have something to give you.
That's OK. I can wait three days.
What's in three days?
Come on. You don't have to pretend with me.
I know!
You know, three daysâ€¦ till Christmas?
Christmas? What's Christmas?
Wait, you really don't remember?
If you don't remember you're Santa, nobody's gonna get their presents.
I'm not gonna get my Honkin' Henry Extreme, and Christmasâ€¦
Christmas is gonna be ruined! Mummy! Daddy!
Christmas is gonna be ruined! Mummy! Daddy! What's wrong?
He doesn't remember what Christmas is. We need to go see Dr. Wiperglass now!
Yup, it appears he has amnesia.
Oh no.
Oh no. Could you explain what that is? You know, for the children.
Amnesia is when you can't remember anything, even who you are.
It can happen when you bump your head.
What? How long until he can remember?
Could be a while.
Christmas is in three days!
Well, some cars recover faster if they're surrounded by familiar things.
So if I show him familiar things, he might remember who he is?
He just might.
OK.
Come on, Santa.
Is that me?
Am I Santa?
If you are, I could really use a new espresso machine this year.
OK.
I'll have you remembering in no time.
The most important thing about Christmas is toys. This place has got tons of toys.
Hey, does that guy look familiar?
No, but he sure is a handsome fellow.
-Why does he have that funny hat? -What? That's Santa Cars. That's you!
-Really? -Come on, let's look at the toys.
Here we go. Soak it in. This is what Christmas is all about.
Toys, toys, toys.
Look at that one. Yeah, this is a nice toy.
It's so happy. Do you remember Christmas now?
Come on, remember.
Sorry, nothing.
Don't worry. This next thing will definitely work.
Behold, the Honkin' Henry Extreme!
How fun is that?
It's got turbo boost and sonic sound sirens.
-That's neat. -Yeah, I hear it can even do backflips.
Sounds merry and bright.
Well, Santa, you should know. Santa.
You've had tons of letters about it, right, Santa?
Santa? Santa?
Sorry, Cory. I still don't remember.
Man, I really thought that would've worked.
Santa?
Santa!
Hello, children.
-Santa? -Santa.
Santa!
Run!
It's perfect.
Pardon me!
That was a close one.
-I guess I'm really popular. -Look out, someone's coming.
Be careful with those decorations! Thank you.
That's it. Maybe decorations will help you remember.
He's over here. Just come look.
Cory, you expect me to believe that at this very moment,
parked on my front lawn, isâ€¦
-Hi, Cory! -Santa Cars. Oh my gosh!
Wait. He hit his head. He doesn't remember who he is.
Really? Jeez, what are we gonna do?
I'm working on it. Could you do me a favour?
I'm working on it. Could you do me a favour? -Plug in your Christmas lights? -Sure.
-Plug in your Christmas lights? -Sure.
Get ready.
So, Santa, do you remember Christmas now?
No. I still don't remember a thing.
Hello there.
Am I on the nice list? Great idea! Santa, you remember the naughty or nice list, right?
Great idea! Santa, you remember the naughty or nice list, right?
The naughty or nice list? What's that?
The list you keep of all the cars that are naughty or nice.
Like, me and Freddie are on the nice list.
So, who's on the naughty list?
Hi, Cory. What do you want?
Well?
-What's going on? -She seems nice to me.
What? Oh no.
-Your calibration is way off, mister. -Wait, what's happening?
This is worse than I thought.
I'm gonna show you everything there is about Christmas. Let's go!
Nope.
Nothing.
OK.
Come on!
Me?
Come on!
Yeah, you've got it.
No. Oh no. No!
No!
Santa!
Look out!
Cold!
Yeah!
Snow!
It's almost time for the tree lighting ceremony.
What? It's Christmas Eve already?
Oh no!
If you don't remember by tonight, nobody will get any presents. I won't get my Honkin' Henry Extreme!
I won't get my Honkin' Henry Extreme!
No macaroni?
Oh no.
Christmas will be ruined.
All right, kiddos. Let's go.
You should come. Maybe the Christmas music will ring some bells?
Bells!
I love you.
Bells? Wait a second.
Thatâ€¦ That sounds familiar.
Oh my gosh. Bells? You remember bells? Come on, let's go!
Cory, slow down.
Come quick. This way.
We'll definitely find something here.
How's this? Do you remember this bell?
Sorry.
How about this?
Does this remind you of anything?
Nope.
Sorry, not this bell either.
What? There's got to be something that'll work.
Welcome to the Bumperton Hills tree lighting ceremony.
We'll be decorating the tree together,
and Eileen will top it all off with "The Carol of the Bells."
This is it. This'll definitely work. Come on!
This is gonna be great!
Awesome. What do you think, Santa?
Santa?
Higher, Daddy, higher!
Higher, Daddy. Higher!
Iâ€¦ I remember now.
Really?
-I remember everything now. -You remember you're Santa?
No.
I remember my family. My name is Benjamin Bell.
What? Benjamin Bell?
Yes, Benjamin Bell. I'm from Spoiler Valley.
Yes, Benjamin Bell. I'm from Spoiler Valley. -I live there with my family. -Family?
-I live there with my family. -Family? -Did you get your memory back? -You're notâ€¦ Santa?
-Did you get your memory back? -You're notâ€¦ Santa?
Iâ€¦
I guess not.
You're not Santa.
Sorry, Cory.
That'sâ€¦ That's OK.
I'm glad you remembered who you are.
Thanks, Cory.
Wait.
If you're not Santa,
that meansâ€¦ the real Santa's OK!
He's probably delivering gifts right now.
Yeah! Christmas is saved!
-Yeah! -Wellâ€¦ -Yeah! -You know what to do with this.
My letter. I've got to put this up for the real Santa. Let's go, hurry!
Honkin' Henry, here I come!
Milk and cookies, check.
Letter, check.
Everything else, check, check, check.
It's all done.
Spoiler Valley? That's a three-day drive.
Three days?
I'd better get going, then.
Are you sure?
It's dark and icy out there. We wouldn't want you to get hurt again.
I guess I won't see my family for Christmas this year.
You're more than welcome to stay with us.
Thanks, that'sâ€¦ -That's very kind of you. -Try and get some rest.
-That's very kind of you. -Try and get some rest. Goodnight, Ben.
Come on, kids. Gotta get to bed so Santa can deliver presents.
Macaroni!
I'm sorry you won't be able to spend Christmas with your family.
Me too, Cory.
Thanks for helping me remember. I'm glad Christmas isn't ruined.
Yeah.
Cory!
Coming!
Goodnight, Santa.
I mean, goodnight, Mr. Bell.
Dear Santa, I've been thinking a lot about Christmas lately, as you always do.
I've been thinking a lot about Christmas lately, as you always do.
A lot of things make Christmas, Christmas.
The toys, the traditions, the lights,
the toysâ€¦
But today, I learned that Christmas isn't just about getting gifts.
It's about giving them.
Sometimes that gift can be a hug or a song or a bedtime story.
Christmas isn't about what's under the tree.
It's about who's around it.
I know it's super late, but I wanted to switch my Christmas wish.
For my present this year, I want my new friend, Mr. Bell,
to be able to spend Christmas with his family.
I hope it's not too much trouble to change my wish.
Thanks for all the hard work. And merry Christmas, Santa.
Love, Cory Carson.
Christmas!
It's Christmas!
Cookies are gone.
-Presents are under the tree! -Presents!
Ben's not here!
Santa brought Mr. Bell home to be with his family!
Brought who home?
Wait, what are you doing here?
I stayed the night. Remember?
But my letter. My wish.
-I wonder who that could be. -Your wish?
-I wonder who that could be. -Your wish? What? Didn't you get your toy?
I changed my wish.
Changed? What did you change it to?
Benjamin?
Betty? Junior?
How is this possible?
-Oh, we missed you, Benjamin. -Daddy.
How did you get here? Everyone, this is my family.
Oh my goodness. We're just opening our Christmas presents.
Why don't youÂ  join us?
This is Papa. This is Cory and Chrissy.
Seems like we have lots to talk about.
I brought you some gifts.
Hey, buddy. Did you get your Honkin' Henry Extreme?
I got something better.
[man over radio] Copy.
[woman] We're at the system's furthest extreme,
just blasted through the rockfall into theÂ second chamber, about to--
-[woman] Listen. -[soft clangor]
[man over radio] Cave team, what's...
[woman screaming] We've gotta get out of here! We gotta get out!
[claps] Ally.
[Ally] Dad always told me I was gifted,
the way I was able to adapt so quickly to becoming deaf,
feeling those around me.
[imitates Ally mockingly] My name is Ally.
Look at me everyone, I can read lips.
[Ally] Maybe not all those around me.
[Hugh] So, we're going to have to re-route the main drain,
which means we're going to have to put in a whole new pumping station.
And that's not going to be cheap.
Okay, so fix it.
Oh, why don't you cut the shit, Max?
-[Max] What was that? -You heard me.
Wait.
Max, you recommended the engineer who caused this problem, so--
And you guaranteed me a specific cost for the work
upon your initial ground inspection of the site.
[Hugh] Okay,
we'll fix it.
[Max] Good.
That guy's a prick.
Yeah, well, I can't afford to lose any clients right now.
With all the jobs we've been doing?
Well, you know, college does not come cheap and you'll find that out
when you settle down and have children of your own.
Why do I have to?
I live vicariously through you.
Ally pick a school yet?
Uh... no, but I'm hoping it will be NYU.
Good school. Yeah, it's a great school.
Real close to home.
Yes. Yes.
[laughs] Look, I don't want her going halfway across the country.
-She's not ready for that .-Oh, she's not ready?
-She's not ready for that .-Oh, she's not ready? -No. -[phone rings]
Excuse me.
Hello?
Hey, you busy?
I'm just leaving work.
[woman] Could you please stop
and pick up Mom's prescriptions on the way home?
Yeah, sure. No problem.
And, Hugh, a parent from Ally's school called,
she saw two boys
mocking herÂ and joking around behind her back.
Again?
[woman] Yeah, again.
But please don't say anything to her, you know how she is,
-just don't say anything. -Okay. Bye. Bye.
I need a drink, you look like you could use a drink,
let's get some drinks.
Why, when I can live vicariously through you?
[laughs] All right.
Hey.
-Hi. -[video games beeping]
I told you not to buy him all those damn electronics.
He's 12, Mom. All the kids have them.
Yeah, I know, but he shouldn't.
Jude, no games before homework.
But this primes my brain.
Hi, Rob.
How did you know that was me?
Your hands smell like Twinkies.
I washed them.
-Okay. -I did.
Can I walk with you for a while?
Sure.
My parents are taking me to look at cars this weekend.
[gasps] Really?
Yeah.
If it was up to my parents,
I'd never drive a car for the rest of my life.
That's no big deal, I'll just pick you up every day.
Deal.
Deal.
[shouting] Ally's home!
How's my boy?
Hey, dweeb.
Butt face.
Hi, Mom.
Where have you been?
Why are you so late?
[Ally] I walked.
You walked by yourself?
No, I walked with Rob.
[Mom] That's the second time this week.
[Jude shouting] That's because she wants to bone him!
-[shouting] Jude! -Who cares?
You should have texted me, Ally.
How do I know where you are?
We're just friends, Mom.
[sarcastically] Right.
Have you kissed him?
[shouting] Mom!
-[dog barks] -I think she kissed him.
[whispering] She better not have.
[Ally] Everyone has their own story,
-where they were when it happened.. -[laughing]
...what they were doing.
[Ally] This is how it happened for us,
this is our story.
Grandma!
[whispering] This is awkward.
You know, these aren't mine.
[Grandma] You know your mother, she will ground me indefinitely.
I won't tell.
Thank you, sweetheart.
I love you.
-Go on, off to bed. -[Ally chuckles]
-[Mom] Then again I'm not telling... -[Hugh] I know.
-[high pitch ringing] -[Ally] Three years ago,
I lost my grandparents and my hearing.
But somehow, I feel like it's my parents who lost the most.
Hey, do you sleep with that thing?
Hey, Dad.
Hi.
So, who is he?
Oh, my God, Dad!
I'm your father,Â I'm supposed to know these things.Â Come on.
Mom freaked out on me.
Really? Is that what happened?
You guys are afraid to let me leave the house. It's stupid.
We worry about you.
Well, you shouldn't, because I'm perfectly fine.
[Hugh] Okay.
So is he a nice guy or...
-[Ally sighs] Yes. -[chuckles] Yeah?
He's really nice. He's even learning to sign.
I like him already.
Dad, what?
What? No.
So, how is everything, okay? How was school today?
It was okay.
[Hugh] Good.
You know you can talk to me about anything?
I know.
Okay, don't stay up too late.
Love ya.
You need to wake up.
-[helicopter engine roaring] -Something's happening!
What's going on?
-[door closes] -[reporter] Unprecedented proportions...
What's happening?
-Is it terrorists? -[Jude] Uncle Glenn!
[Mom] They don't know.
[TV reporter] ...limiting all media from entering the affected areas.
But New York One can now confirm
that theÂ cities of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia have both been hit,
the number ofÂ smaller town attacks continuing to climb.
First they say it's terrorists then they say it's chemicals.
[TV reporter] Maryland and West Virginia. Built up locations, areas...
-[Glenn] Try another channel. -...seem to be...
...who insistÂ the infestation is under control.
Images on social media are telling a much different story.
We'd like to warn our audience, the images you are about to see are graphic.
-[sirens wailing] -[screaming]
Dad?
It's okay. It's fine.
[male TV reporter] Another video posted just moments ago
was shot inside one of the affected areas
and has since gone viral.
What the hell does that mean? "Don't make noise."
-[banging] -[screams]
[male reporter] ...urging people to stayÂ in their homes...
-Stay here. -[reporter] ...and to stay silent.
National Guard Units have been deployed to all affected...
Shit, man.
Everybody, let's do what they say.
Put your phones on silent, okay?
[Mom] What's happening?
I don't know.
[male reporter] ...scientists exploring the cave, blasted through an ancient rockfall
sealed off for millions of years.
What the?
Jesus Christ.
[male reporter] And close all windows and doors.
Do not make noise. Do not attempt to...
All right, you hang tight, I'll be right back.
-Where are you going? -I'm gonna get some gear.
[stutters] You want to stick around while a million of those things show up?
No, but we're supposed to just stay here and stay silent.
Right.
Then the cities are theÂ worst place to be, aren't they?
[male reporter] Do not make noise.
Do not attempt to drive.
Mom, if you're not up to this, then we can stay.
There are plenty of people waiting this out in their homes.
No.
You do me a favor, put these with your things.
Hide them as best you can.
-I don't want the kids to see. -Okay.
They're all that matters now.
-Hey, you got room for this? -Yeah.
What's that?
Tactical supplies.
Whoa! Can I go with Uncle Glenn?
I'll take care of him.
Okay.
Stay away from those.
-I'll follow you. -Okay, let's go.
Wait. What are you... What are you doing?
[whispering] Give me the baby.
-Come on. -[woman] Please, don't!
-Oh, my God. -[baby cries louder]
Someone help me, please.
I'll go with her.
[whispering] Yeah, yeah.
-Oh, no. -[baby crying louder]
[screaming] Oh, my God.
[female reporter] A state of emergency has been called for the entire Eastern Seaboard,
with death tolls in all infested areas being described as catastrophic.
The CDC is urging everyone west of Interstate 77 from Cleveland, south of...
-Are we doing the right thing? -...to remain west of that line.
Do not approach...
-I don't know. -[police sirens wailing]
[Rob over device] But where up north are you gonna go?
I don't know.
Some place quiet.
You should leave too, you could follow us.
My parents said we're staying.
The news says better to stay put.
So much for car shopping, huh?
Don't cry. I'm sure this is allÂ going to be over soon.
let's make a promise that we're going to stay in touch with each other.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Promise?
Promise.
-Everybody just wait here, okay? -[car door alarm beeping]
But Otis has to pee.
All right, make it quick, okay?
[softly] Come on, Otis.
Hey.
Hey, I got this, you just watch him.
All right, okay.
[Hugh] Hey, how you doing, buddy?
I don't know.
Scared, I guess.
It's okay.
You're riding with Uncle Glenn,Â so... He's a tough guy in times like this.
-Do you know how I met him? -No.
[Hugh] We went to high school together,
and after school these three guys, these lacrosse players, they...
sort of all came up to me and they were going to bully me.
And, um, I... I wasn't going to fight them,
so I tried to talk my way out of it.
Before I knew it, he shows up...
grabs one of the guys and head-butts him.
-And the guy drops right to the ground. -[laughs]
And the other two guys just kind of ran away.
And we've been best friends ever since.
I wish I was that brave.
I have a feeling you might be.
All right? So, don't worry.
-[shouting] Shut up! Shut the dog up! -[dogs keeps barking] [Mom] She's deaf. -She can't hear you! -[Hugh] Okay, okay, don't shoot!
-She can't hear you! -[Hugh] Okay, okay, don't shoot! -What do you want? -Just shut up!
-What do you want? -Just shut up! -[Hugh] Okay, all right! -[loud gunshot]
-[shouting] Okay! Tell me what you want. -[man] Shut up!
-[Hugh] All right. What do you want? -Keys to your car.
-[Hugh] Okay. -[shouting] Look, I'm not messing around!
Okay, okay.
Don't shoot, please. Please.
[Glenn] Everybody in the car.
[grunting] Please, man. Please, man. Please! Don't leave me here, man. Please! Those things are gonna catch up to me.
Don't leave me here, man. Please! Those things are gonna catch up to me.
[shouting] Please, don't leave me!
Please!
-[Mom] What's he doing? -[Hugh] I don't know.
[Hugh] What's going on?
-[Glenn] He... -[Hugh] What? -[Jude crying] -Hey, hey, hey! You okay?
-[Jude crying] -Hey, hey, hey! You okay?
He's good. He just wanted to be with you.
It's okay, it's all right.
[Glenn] We got to go Roads are going to get bad. [Hugh] All right. Okay, all right. Thanks.
[Mom] What are they saying?
They're calling them vesps because of how they swarm.
Avispa means wasp in Spanish.
How could we not know about them until now?
Well they got trapped in that cave, whatever they were,
and then they became something else.
They're not supposed to be here.
-[screaming] Dad! Watch out! -[tires squealing]
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay?
Yeah.
What do you think?
-Man, it's all jammed. -I know.
Okay. Okay.
-You follow me. -All right. Okay.
[male reporter over radio] This is the emergencyÂ broadcast system, if you are hearing this transmission,
the vesps are continuing to spread outward from the cities
and north along the Hudson River.
Infested States now include Pennsylvania, New York,
Maryland, West Virginia, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.
If you are residing in any of these States,
do not attempt to flee.
Whoa!
[Hugh] Hey, what's up?
[Glenn over the phone] Listen, it's going to get a little rough up ahead.
If anything looks too shoddy, I'll stop and clear a path, okay?
Okay.
Just lead the way.
[Glenn] You got it, buddy.
What's the matter? Afraid that minivan of yours couldn't keep-- Oh, shit!
-[shouting] Glenn? -[car motor dying]
Glenn!
-Hey! -[creaking]
-[Hugh] Hey! -[Glenn grunts]
[Hugh] Glenn, hey.
Hey. Hey.
-[Hugh] Can you get out? -[grunts and moans]
Hey, man, my... my leg's stuck in here.
Okay. Call an ambulance, okay?
I'm going to pass out.
[Hugh] Okay, all right. We're going to get youÂ out of there,Â all right?
Just... I'm going to get you out.
All right.
-[metal rattling] -We'll get you out.
-[Glenn] The kids okay? -Yep. The kids are fine. Don't worry.
Okay. Sorry, it's jammed, sorry.
-I'll get you out, okay? -[Glenn] You got to leave me. You... [heavy breathing]
You got to go. You got to get out of here.
[Hugh] Nope. [chuckles] No, no, no.
We're going to wait with you, I'm not leaving you here.
What you gonna wait for, man? Those things to show up?
I'm not leaving you, okay?
[Glenn] The only way I'm getting out of here is with cutters.
My guess is the fire department is kind of busy right now.
Okay, all right. Let me just find something to pry you out.
Okay? Just one second.
-No luck? -[Mom] No, nothing.
-[phone beeps, dialing] -[Glenn] Oh, man.
[Hugh] Hang in.
[Hugh] Okay, just stay there. -We'll get you out of here. -[Glenn moans]
-It's all right. It's all right. -[Glenn groans]
[Hugh] It's all right.
[Glenn] Hey, man.
[Glenn] Hugh?
Fuck! Yeah? Yeah, what?
Go get my guns.
-What? -[Glenn] I need my guns.
-Why? -[Glenn] Get my guns. Please, hurry.
[sighs] Okay.
Okay. All right.
There you go, what do you... You want the...
Here.
Here.
-[Glenn] Yeah. -Okay? All right.
-[Hugh] Okay. Now, listen to me.. -[Glenn] Yeah.
[Hugh] I'm going to try again to get you out of here, all right?
What are you doing? Why do you want those?
I'll shoot you if you don't go, that's what I'm gonna do.
You got to go take care of your family.
All right, I'm going to go,
we're going to go find somebody with some cutters, okay?
We're going to get you out of here and to a hospital, all right?
-[Glenn] Okay. Okay. -We're going to be back very soon, okay?
-God damn, Hugh. -[Hugh] It's okay.
I promise. I promise.
[Glenn] Okay.
Okay.
Okay. Come on, let's go. No luck?
Okay.
-[Ally] Is he dead? -[Mom] No. No. He's not dead. He's just hurt very badly. Let's go.
No. He's not dead. He's just hurt very badly. Let's go.
We're gonna get back to the highway and find somebodyÂ with cutters.
-Get in the car. -[Mom] Come on.
[whispering] No noise.
[screaming] Turn it off!
What?
-[dog barks louder] -Keep him quiet!
[screaming] Shut him up!
Glenn.
[Glenn shouting] Let's go! Let's do this, you son of a bitch!
[whispering] Shut up!
[whispering] Those things stink like shit.
[softly] I know, honey.
Don't swear.
[Ally whispering] They were scratching in the same places over and over.
[whispering] We can't stay here.
[whispering] Okay.
I need to try something, okay?
Stay here. Quiet.
It's okay.
-[gasping] -[softly] Find her inhaler!
Iâ€™m sorry.
[whispering] No, it's okay.
Listen. They can't see.
Only hear.
[whispering] Dad.
I know how to live in silence.
We all do.
Nothing above a whisper. No phones, no texts.
Weâ€™re going to need shelter before it gets dark.
Okay?
That's our only option. Okay?
I need your lighter.
She doesnâ€™t smoke.
[whispering] I'm sorry.
Okay.
You guys pack your bags.
[whispering] Why?
[mouths] It's okay.
[Hugh] Oh, God.
[whispering] Come on., come on, come on.
Come on.
[Hugh whispering] Come on.
Come on.
Everyone needs to rest.
[mouths] Everyone rest.
[Hugh] Got room for one more?
I know you may hate me for a long time.
I know... but...
I had to.
I'm sorry.
[whispering] You need to tell the kids.
I suspect Ally knows something,
but it'sÂ not right to keep it from Jude. It's not.
[whispering] Their dog just died
and now I'm supposedÂ to tell them their grandmother's next?
I just about got us killed back there.
[whispering] It's okay, Dad.
It's okay.
There's a house!
[whispering] Okay.
[whispering] Okay.
Get the hell off my land.
This is private property, god damn it!
I said get the hell off my land!
[whispering] Let's go that way.
It's about thirty feet.
I'll go first.
Once I'm through to the other end, I'll wave you through.
Okay?
Okay.
[whispering] You come.
Okay, Jude, you first.
A rattlesnake!
[mouths] Get her on the couch.
See if you can find any peroxide or alcohol.
I'll get some scissors.
Does it hurt, Mom?
Just a little, honey.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have left--
I found it.
[whispering] Oh, shit.
[whispering] Rob?
Rob, what's happening?
[heavy breathing, whispering] How are you?
Did you get somewhere quiet?
-I think so. -[Rob coughing]
Rob... Rob, where are your parents?
[panting] They're dead.
Rob, get out of there.
[tearfully] Rob, you can come here, I'll explain how to find me.
Rob, get out of there.
Rob! [crying]
Please.
-What have we found out today? -Nothing good.
[whispering] A man was crucified in Mississippi.
Okay.
It's okay.
[whispering] Without antibiotics that infection's going to spread.
[whispering] Okay. So, we have to find some. Are there any here?
-There's none, I've looked everywhere. -Nothing?
Nothing.
Okay, so how long?
It depends on the person.
Okay, but you're a nurse. How long?
Without antibiotics, not long.
Okay.
[whispering] Why can't I go?
[whispering] No, you have to stay here and take care of Mom with Grandma.
I'm sorry.
I wish Glenn was here.
Me, too.
There you go.
Okay.
Come here.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
Vesps?
Oh, okay. Come on.
We have to go around back.
Stay right behind me.
[mouths] We need fire.
The mop.
Stay alert.
He's weird.
[mouths] No, it's okay.
[whispering] Let's go.
[whispering] You did good, Mom.
[whispering] Yeah, not too shabby for a field dressing, huh?
That's not what I meant.
I know.
[whispering] They're back.
Stay here.
[whispering] Jesus, Ally.
[whispering] CNN's on most of the time, but it drops out now and then.
[whispering] Yeah, I know. I can't get anything.
They're broadcasting from a bunker somewhere.
-I don't know. -Who, CNN?
They said that vesps don't like intense cold.
People above the Arctic Circle, they're surviving.
There's footage of dead vesps in snow drifts.
You've seen that?
-Yeah, but there's something else. -What?
They're calling it The Grey.
It's places where the electricity's gone out and people are getting cut off
when their phone and computer batteries die.
Like entire regions of the country are being wiped off the map.
Jesus.
It's like we're back in the Dark Ages.
[Hugh whispering] I made this for you.
I think Uncle Glenn would have wanted you to have it.
[whispering] Thank you, Dad.
Just be... be careful with it, okay?
Just...
He's here.
-What do they want? -I don't know.
I'm going to go talk to him.
Aren't you going to take the gun?
[whispers] No.
[mouths] No, thank you.
[whispering] We have to head north.
-[whispering] Okay. -Okay?
I love you.
I love you.
[Mom whispering] Hugh?
[whispering] Get up.
[whispering] I don't see anybody.
[Jude whispers] Dad!
[Mom whispering] What is it?
[whispering] It's a little girl.
[Mom] Let me look.
[sighs] Jesus.
All right, all right,Â let her in.
[whispering] I think she's in shock.
Are you alone?
Are you okay? Why are you here?
[whispering] What's your name?
It's okay.
[whispering] Hugh, look at her jaw.
[whispering] It's okay.
Oh, God.
Did they send you here?
Phones were ringing.
Phones now silent.
Get in the basement.
-[panting, moaning] -You stay here...
my darling girl.
[whispering] Dad!
[Ally] We know the vesps don't like the cold,
but will they evolve and adapt like they did in the past?
I know I did.
So, will the rest of humanity evolve?
Will we adapt to this new world of silence
and remember what it is that separates us from them?
Madame de Monthabor, Madame de Choisy, Countesse of Lubac,
Baroness of Courcelles, her governess, her chambermaid,
the Marquise de Montaigu, her daughter, her other daughter,
Lady Mary Wortley,
and her friend, whose name I forget, but not her pretty face.
And I forgot the Marquise de Saint MÃ©ran and Madame de Volnay.
Just a small sample of your collection,
which has reached my ears here, away from society.
Marquis,
what do you care if my name appears on your list of conquests?
Enjoy my friendship, and drive away this whim.
Madame, you judge me lightly.
Isn't your philosophy based upon lightness?
How can one reason,
and escape superstitions, illusions, complacency,
without an ethereal, agile, light-hearted wit?
Why such inconstancy in a man with such reason?
For the sake of honesty.
Did honesty lead you to seduce all those women?
I seduce no one, I am always the first to be seduced.
You're so sensitive, marquis.
Did honesty persuade each of them of your ardent feelings?
I persuade no one.
I merely expressed the sincere feeling they aroused within me.
Is it not strange, however, that your noble feelings
inevitably evaporate a few days later?
Nature is fickle. That is the way of this world. It would be dishonest otherwise.
As for me, nature has made me indifferent to the agitations of love and the heart.
It's always seemed to me to be a predictable, tiresome spectacle.
Poor marquis, it saddens me to sadden you.
Despite my indifference to your feelings,
are you still determined to stay a few days longer?
As long as you will allow it, madame.
You will weary, marquis. You will weary, you'll see.
We shall see. We shall observe it together.
Good morning, marquis.
Up already?
Good morning, madame.
Tell me, did you love your late husband?
What an odd question. Of course, marquis.
You truly loved him?
As a wife is expected to love her husband.
Married people sometimes develop sincere feelings.
In truth, I was quite fond of him, until our wedding.
After it was all worry and strife.
Do you regret getting married?
Would you like to know what I think?
I believe it's a pity that marriage is available
to such ill-prepared souls.
Just as one is taught deportment and Latin,
one should be taught about life as a couple before getting married.
Love alone can bring such teaching.
Then I shall never be made for married life.
You've never yearned to love and be loved?
Really loved.
As a child, yes.
From an early age,
I observed those who claimed to be in love,
but I soon realized, they merely put on a show of appearances,
in order to convince the world, and thereby themselves.
I only believe in friendship.
Love, coupled with flesh, grows as fragile, and bruises easily.
Madame, how can you care for love, if you've never seen anything like it?
Know that I've witnessed love, at its most genuine.
My aunt and uncle, who raised me, lived in such harmony together
that it seemed two people became one and the same person.
From my tenderest age, without even realizing it,
their perfection nurtured my soul.
Why, nurtured by their example, have you had so many affairs without consequence?
Because...
with each encounter, I thought I recognized,
if only for an instant, a glimmer of this ideal.
An ideal which I have never given up on, which will impoverish my life until it is realized.
-Must I feel sorry for you? -Oh, no.
I have every hope...
and it grows with each day beside you.
I give you hope?
How amusing you are, marquis. You are told one thing, you hear another.
Though I do not tire of studying you, and your lively imagination,
I tire of repeating myself to drive this obsession from your mind.
Not my mind, madame.
My heart.
Who knows where the heart hides?
Yours is so filled with wit, one may miss it.
Madame, before your men set the chairs down,
please, take one last look at this view,
where nature expresses itself, free from us,
left entirely to its own devices.
Put that chair just over there.
Look.
Do we not imagine someone sitting there, musing?
Do we not sense these meditations taking on nature's colors?
We no longer behold nature, but man's encounter with it.
Marquis, you have struck home.
But why did you ask to bring two chairs, when one sufficed?
Because my demonstration is not finished.
Put that one over there.
Don't these two chairs make us imagine two people,
sitting silently, side by side,
their souls united before nature,
joined by a bond as sacred as the imperturbable serenity of nature?
I crossed paths with the marquis.
Will he be staying much longer?
I don't know.
He hasn't left the chÃ¢teau for four months.
Not one dinner or supper without his company.
Several times, his business has called him away
to Paris or elsewhere,
but each time he's chosen to stay here,
never complaining about the sums his absence costs him.
And I suppose, madame, he continues to court you with the greatest attention,
to prove his love for you.
Yes.
He's so proud, he won't return to Paris, without having conquered his prey.
You're pensive.
Need I fear some of his flattery has hit home?
Is your friend wrong?
Please, let us change the topic.
Did I come from Paris for us to keep secrets?
Remember, our friendship is marked
by the candor and liberty of our conversations.
Has this man broken the bond we've shared since childhood?
No, dear, but I know what you think of the marquis.
If I confide in you, I'm afraid it will upset you.
You know how much your opinion matters to me.
Am I to understand you've given in to the marquis?
No, I've given in to no one, believe me.
I believe you.
But then... whence comes this turmoil?
My dear,
the marquis you knew in Paris is not the same man
that has been here the past few months.
A man can change. I've witnessed it, day after day.
A man like him would assume any disguise to reach his ends.
You know me best of all. Do you think I'm that naive?
Madame, how peculiar to offer me something on the day of my birth.
It's quite the fashion in England.
I don't imagine it will catch on here, but I'm flattered by the thought.
Thank you, madame.
Dear marquis, it's been nearly six months
since you retreated from society, neglecting your affairs.
Today, as you turn a year older,
are you not inclined to consider time more closely,
and what madness it has been to stay here so long?
It is the life I led up until this moment which I now consider as madness.
Your face awakened my reason, your company strengthened it.
Marquis, I've known you more adept at flattery.
Sincerity is often clumsy.
It doesn't take the paths...
of seduction.
It is vulnerable and innocent,
struggling to carry, like a child, what is purest in us.
One day, you will miss society.
Crowds tire me.
And solitude, as well. I have found my society,
the most perfect society, formed by a man and woman in love.
Provided you find a woman who loves you.
Well, I allow myself to hope, madame.
What's this hope based on?
The proof you give me each day.
I give you proof?
Of course. Each day, your company fortifies my feelings.
With all that fortification, they'll become rock-hard.
-You mock me. -I'm sorry. No, I...
It may seem idiotic, but I love to see you smile.
Do you still dream of me giving myself to you?
More than ever.
And how, with such fervent impatience, do you manage to remain so patient?
I train my patience to be commensurate with my impatience.
I must congratulate you on your self-restraint,
and for never stealing a kiss.
I would so fear offending you,
and losing the pleasure of your company forever.
A highly reasonable reasoning for such an impassioned man.
You find me too reasonable?
Did I say you were too much so?
No, but...
But...?
Do you mean...?
I shall say no more.
My friend.
Hello, madame.
Hello, marquis.
Madame, I know you are friends with the marquise.
I do not wish that my presence should stop you
from speaking freely,
so, allow me to deprive myself of your company.
Thank you, marquis, for your attention.
It may make me regret your absence. I wouldn't want to encumber you with regrets.
I am off for a stroll.
But nature will be but an echo of your grace.
Know that my natural inclination for distrust has gone.
It was a guide, which let me distinguish true from false.
Now it's brought me to my destination, I am freed.
Oh, my friend, what passion.
Not all passions are alike.
Ours is intense without being excessive.
Our sentiments are as filled with tenderness as with reason.
Tell me, what's the news from Paris?
No news that could affect your remote and serene life.
I'm sure if all of Paris talked of you and the marquis, you wouldn't care.
You're right. Is it the case?
-Do you really want to know? -Yes, amuse me, my dear.
Now that your union is known, everyone is amusing themselves
with betting on the number of days you have left with the Marquis.
Love is an insult for those who have none.
Are they only talking about us?
Oh, I can tell you a sad story.
Do tell.
I don't want my happiness to hide the world's ills from my soul.
Do you remember Madame de JoncquiÃ¨res?
Many years ago, she lived not far from me.
The daughter of a baron and a countess,
but conceived out of wedlock, she had no position to claim.
She was seduced by a duke,
and thought her marriage to him would save her.
But he deceived her with a fake marriage.
She gave birth to a daughter, the fruit of their union.
She took the duke to trial,
but having less influence than the man who betrayed her,
she lost and was ruined.
Ever since, we've had no news of her.
I remember.
Do you tell me this as a reminder of the treachery of certain men?
Oh, no, madame.
I tell you this because one of my servants recognized her.
Where is she now?
In a place so sordid, you would have trouble picturing it.
A sort of vice den,
where men gather to play and have supper.
Usually one or two of the guests stay,
and spend the night with madame, or her daughter, as they please.
How old is her daughter?
Fifteen or 16, perhaps.
Apparently the girl's beauty is infinitely delicate and refined, yet...
lost among such baseness, no one recognizes it.
How much crueler it seems
when misfortune befalls those who've known our condition.
For my part, I believe language is correct
to put "happiness" just a pin drop away from "hapless."
Madame, you are wrong.
Happiness that doesn't last is called pleasure.
Soon we'll have to cut the trees around it,
so, their shade doesn't hinder its growth.
To think this tree will outlive us,
and perhaps will be the only remaining witness of our union.
You're not listening. Your thoughts are elsewhere.
I'm sorry, madame. My thoughts prevented me from hearing you.
What are these thoughts that have distanced me from you?
I fear they'll displease you, as much as me.
Let us be displeased together. We can console each other.
Well...
Business calls me to Paris.
Can't you send a delegate?
Unfortunately not this time.
If the amount wasn't substantial, I would forget it.
My dear marquis, don't be upset.
Go to Paris. Settle the matter as quickly as possible.
You consent to me leaving you here for a few days?
What are a few days compared to the time we have left together?
And do you need my permission?
Do you feel bound by some authority I might wield over you?
I could complain.
You are so right, madame, and when I leave you,
I shall delight in the thought of seeing you again.
You still haven't told me about your trip.
You haven't given me a chance, madame.
Oh, forgive me. I'll give you your chance. I'm listening.
I thought of you.
And when you weren't thinking of me?
I thought of your legs.
Marquis...
When you weren't thinking of my legs?
I thought of your back.
-My back? -Yes. I love it so.
Be serious. Tell me.
I thought of your navel.
Be quiet. There must've been more during your trip.
Yes.
A thousand building ideas.
Building?
The marquis isn't with you? He's in Rouen.
With his new taste for business, he travels a lot.
I know what you're thinking.
I do not doubt his fidelity. His mind is full of his undertakings.
He inherited a large sum.
Not sure what else to do with the money, he decided to build townhouses
to leave for posterity.
You're not worried?
Oh, not at all.
You may detect a touch of fatigue.
My health has been somewhat fragile lately.
The marquis' trips and occupations don't upset you?
Not in the least.
Am I to understand that you and the marquis still get along,
as perfectly as ever?
Absolutely.
Nothing, even time,
has altered the plenitude of your feelings?
Nothing. Each day, they grow stronger and fuller.
Forgive me, then, my suspicions.
It could be, my dear friend,
that I'm beginning to envy you.
Envy me?
Must I wish upon you what happened to me?
Unfortunately, my overcautious nature won't allow it.
My stubbornness won't let me surrender, and prompts me to lecture others.
But what can I teach, when I myself have tasted nothing?
Men have grasped this. Not a single one courts me.
I have protected myself so thoroughly that nothing could ever happen to me.
Oh, my dear...
My pride would let you believe that nothing has changed
between the marquis and I.
But our friendship is too sincere. I can hide my upset no longer.
Two years ago,
you said the marquis would leave me for one day, then two,
that little by little,
his business would call him away more frequently,
that little by little, he'd return without a word,
settle into his chair, talk to his dog,
and drift off.
I fear your predictions were right.
Tell me what's happened.
The more passionate we are,
the more we exaggerate the slightest thing.
You know the architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux?
Yes.
He was to stay with us one month. In the end, he stayed three.
He was to work on some of the marquis' projects.
His presence would make it easier to discuss certain important matters.
At first, we'd lunch with Mr. Ledoux.
In the afternoon,
the marquis would spend a while talking with him.
But before long, we were having all our meals together.
I was excluded from the conversation without their realizing it,
their passion for their projects was so great.
From morn till night, the marquis was at the architect's side.
Their friendship was so intense that I ceased to exist.
When Mr. Ledoux left,
I thought the marquis would be less distant, but alas.
He lost himself in countless letters, books,
and heaven knows what deep thoughts...
that my caresses no longer affect him.
He only addresses me to ask my permission to take his leave
to deal with cornices, chimneys, windows, or tiles.
My dear, you are wrong to be alarmed.
You can trust my experience.
What you describe is but the fate of all unions.
No one escapes it.
I fear that passion cannot last.
They were no ordinary feelings the marquis vowed to love me with.
I couldn't bear it, if it is so.
Pull yourself together, madame. Your fear is unjustified.
The marquis is not courting another woman.
Before you torment yourself, find a way to sound out his feelings.
I'm sure you will be reassured. No?
Dreaming, my friend?
You are dreaming, too, marquise.
It's true, and rather sadly.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I don't believe you, madame.
Come.
Tell me.
Do you become bored, when away from your business?
No, but there are days...
When one is bored.
You are mistaken.
Really, you are very much mistaken.
It's just one of those days, when one is bored.
My friend...
For some time now, I've wanted to say something,
but I fear it will distress you.
You? Distress me?
Perhaps.
Heaven is witness to my innocence.
It happened unbeknownst to me, by a curse,
to which the entire human race is apparently subject to,
since I myself have not escaped it.
It comes from you?
You frighten me, madame. What is it?
Marquis, it's...
Oh, I'm sorry, it will sadden you.
All things considered, I'd best keep quiet.
No, madame, speak.
Do you have a secret in your heart?
Isn't our first rule to bare our souls to each other without reserve?
Haven't you noticed my cheer has gone?
I've lost my appetite. I eat and drink out of necessity.
I can't sleep.
At night, I wonder, I ask myself, "Is the marquis less lovable? No.
Do you have any complaints? No.
Are there any suspected liaisons? No.
Has his tenderness for you diminished? No.
Why, when your friend is the same, has your heart changed?
For it has.
You cannot deny it.
You don't await him with the same impatience.
You don't have the same pleasure at seeing him.
The concern when he was slow to return,
the sweet emotion at the sound of his carriage,
when he appeared, when they announced his arrival...
You no longer feel it."
-What, madame? -My dear marquis,
you are the same, but your friend cannot deny...
that love has gone.
It's a horrible discovery, but no less real.
Madame, you...
You are an extraordinary woman, a unique woman,
a woman like none other.
Your frankness and honesty disconcert me.
I should die of shame.
How great I see you, how small I see myself.
You spoke first, whereas I was guilty first.
Your sincerity inspires me.
I'd be a monster if I didn't admit
that the story of your heart is also mine, word for word.
Everything you said, I thought.
Yet I said nothing.
I suffered.
I don't know when I might have the courage to speak.
-Is that true, my friend? -Nothing could be truer.
Let us congratulate ourselves
at having both lost this fragile, deceptive sentiment which united us.
How unfortunate it would be if my love had endured
while yours had ceased.
Oh, madame, madame,
you have never seemed so beautiful and charming as right now.
And if past experience hadn't made me more cautious,
I would think I loved you more than ever.
Marquis, what is to become of us?
Madame, we'll continue to see each other,
and enjoy the confidence of the most tender friendship.
We shall be spared all the worries and troubles...
Please, excuse my attire, and my discomfort.
If your servant hadn't insisted,
I wouldn't have presented myself, marquise.
My unhappy fate is such that I've found means
to live away from people of your quality, as I consider myself...
unworthy of your gaze.
I won't bore you with the tale of my woes.
You aren't boring me.
I'm listening, madame.
You may be aware that I was born of a union that should never have been.
My mother was Countess de Demontoy, and my father, Baron Obolensky.
I grew up without parents, but was given the finest education.
I was very young
when the Duke of Grimaud asked for my hand in marriage. I thought I was saved.
But he fooled me with a false ceremony.
I found myself with a child and no husband.
My error was to demand justice, and put what little I had toward this end.
But as the man who betrayed me had more influence than me,
I lost my case.
Necessity knows no law. My daughter and I had to live.
We find ourselves in the class of contemptible women.
Where is she? Didn't she accompany you, as I had asked?
Come here, mademoiselle, come here.
Please, sit here.
Sorry.
Sit over there.
Stand up and come to me.
You have beautiful hair.
Thank you, madame.
Could you lift it up?
Yes, madame.
Your neck is even more admirable.
Thank you, madame.
Madame, I'm surprised such a graceful, delicate creature could find
no better home than the one you currently find yourself in.
I took her around during and after my trial,
among magistrates, prelates, dignitaries, and financiers.
They toyed with her for a while, then left her.
It is not her angelic beauty or her refined nature.
She is grace itself, but...
she has nothing of the libertine,
and no talent for stirring the languor of blasÃ© men.
Would you describe her as an honest woman?
Our profession aside,
the most honest.
I admit, for a few months, your life will be austere,
but it won't last forever, and I promise you the finest reward.
Talk it over.
If my demands are beyond you, tell me.
I shall not be offended or surprised.
Madame, we are so flattered by your trust
that each of your demands is an opportunity
for us to thank you.
Those clothes do suit you.
To give you time to adjust to your new life,
we'll meet again in a few months.
What a lovely day. Everything is so sweet.
The air, the wine we drank,
the tender sunshine, and your company, of course.
You say "of course," as if you were just being polite.
Not at all. You are mistaken, marquise.
I imagine you would have preferred sweeter company than mine
to round out your tableau,
like Madame de Bailly's.
I no longer see Madame de Bailly.
Oh, forgive me.
I'd forgotten that relationship was already two weeks old.
Last time, you mentioned a young Italian countess.
-I told you about the contessa? -Yes.
Have her charms lost their effects?
Yes. As soon as she gave herself to me.
It was very embarrassing, I assure you.
I can imagine.
Oh, I'm sorry, my poor marquis. You're all alone with an old friend.
Don't be sorry.
What is sweeter than friendship and more perfect than ours?
There is no turmoil between us. Our hearts are open.
We needn't force ourselves to hide anything.
-Do you wish to sit? -No, let's continue.
Where were we?
I was praising our friendship. But it seems only I enjoy it.
Oh, Marquis, stop asking for tokens. Am I not here with you?
What would you say to an opera or comedy this afternoon?
It seems to me, there is nothing we have not seen.
Why shut ourselves away on such a perfect day?
If I'm not mistaken...
I think it is them. Yes, that is them.
Madame, do you recognize me?
Is it you, madame?
Yes, it's me. How are you? What has become of you?
-It's been an eternity. -Haven't you heard of our misfortune?
We were forced us to live in a way that suited our small means.
You didn't give me any news. I could be offended.
An inconvenience of poverty is the distrust it inspires.
How the young lady has grown.
How it ages me.
When she came to Paris, she was knee-high to a grasshopper.
But you haven't changed, madame.
Time seems to have ignored you.
I don't believe that, but you are kind, as ever.
Let's walk and talk.
Oh, sorry, this is the Marquis des Arcis, my friend.
His presence won't bother us.
Madame,
I understand how one can bear poverty, as a multitude of men and women do.
But to pass from opulence to necessity, like you, to have to settle for it,
and find bliss in it...
Today I have no regrets.
A life devoted to piety seems less restrictive than one of gallantry.
I believe you, more than you can imagine.
If you knew how much I respect your conduct.
Don't have too much respect for us, Madame.
Faith rewards us, well beyond anything you can imagine.
Our life is not a sacrifice, as many think,
but a blessing.
Excuse us, madame, we must leave you.
So abruptly?
We must go to church. We can stay no longer.
Go. I should hate myself if I made you late.
So, Marquis? What would you like to do?
No show today? Are you sure?
Who are those women?
I knew the mother long ago.
She married a gambler, he lost their fortune, then died.
She found herself alone with her young daughter.
Poverty and shame drove her from our society.
But she seems to feel no regret.
Libertines scoff, but religion is a good thing.
Yes. Especially for the unfortunate.
It restores the lost prestige of this mother and her daughter.
Isn't that the Duke de Beauregard and his wife?
We must greet them.
Come.
-Marquise. -Yes.
-There's something I don't understand. -May I be of help?
With such a face as hers, in our society, one could have anything one desires.
You're speaking of...?
Your friend's daughter.
Is her face that beautiful?
I could only see the child from so long ago.
She has the face of one of Raphael's Madonnas.
Why, with such a face,
should she not aim for a better position in society?
Is it not cruel of a mother to impose this fate upon her child?
Modesty of means may be preferable to shameful wealth.
What is it?
I know you, marquis. I know you.
Oh, no, madame, no.
If you believe I'm aroused by that pious girl, you don't know me at all.
I don't believe anything,
I was amusing myself with the thought that religion could tempt you.
But no matter,
as you will soon forget all about her in one or two weeks...
like that little Italian countess.
Ladies.
Morning, madame.
It's early for you. Couldn't you sleep?
I can't sleep anymore.
Is something worrying you?
Your friends' lot.
-Does that still trouble you? -I have so little to think about
that the slightest subject worries me at the moment.
And your building projects?
They're just fine without me worrying about them.
-Madame, have you seen them again? -Who?
Your friends.
-No. -That's not right.
You're rich, they're in need.
You could at least invite them for the occasional meal.
I invited them ten times, to no avail.
They refuse to come to my home.
Frequenting our society does not suit their simplicity.
Opulence invites sin.
-There's nothing we can do to help them? -Do they need our help?
Is religion not a succor and a treasure?
It is they who fret over our fate, and pray for our salvation.
If I sent them 20 Louis, do you think they'd refuse?
I'm sure of it.
Why accept from you what they refuse from me?
What reason do they have to refuse a friend's goodwill?
Marquis, we of the world cannot hope to understand
the scrupulous sensitivities of pious souls.
So, there's nothing I can do to help them?
No, marquis, nothing.
Now that is cruel.
Yes, cruel is the word.
Oh, no.
Oh, marquise.
A girl I've seen only once...
And whom you won't see again.
Madame,
since you are my friend,
I must confide something. I concealed an event from you.
An event?
In the King's Garden,
while you talked to her mother, I walked alongside her, remember?
You can imagine that I couldn't help myself from staring at her.
With each attempt, she turned away, and looked down.
But at one point...
your conversation was concluding when...
she finally met my gaze. And...
What an enlightenment, madame.
Her gaze...
so modest, sincere...
a profound gaze,
free from coquetry and convention.
A gaze...
full of a truth that speaks to you,
though you cannot decipher it.
You saw all that?
How long did she look at you?
I couldn't say.
Perhaps not...
a full second, but...
the longest second one could conceive of,
an infinite second, as it still resonates within me.
Marquis.
Your imagination never ceases to amaze me.
A young woman, embarrassed by your insistence,
glances up, and you fabricate extraordinary dreams.
You, the man of reason,
the Epicurean, who believes we are but a mass of atoms.
That's what my reason keeps telling me, madame.
Yet never has a gaze seemed so true.
Your "nevers" last no longer than your "always."
I of all people know that.
Maybe your collection lacks a pious woman.
You must be right.
You must be right.
And yet...
Marquis, be on your guard.
Do not confuse this girl with those you've known.
She cannot be tempted, seduced, or approached.
You cannot prevail.
Trust me,
if you want to spare yourself suffering, forget that girl.
My friend.
What madness.
At any rate, your plan is ill-founded.
Why is that?
Why would the marquis grow attached to this girl in particular,
and not another?
Because the marquis cannot resist what resists him.
If I inspired lofty sentiments, they were proportional to my resistance.
Haven't you observed that love grows when the object of desire escapes us?
You seem quite sure of yourself.
What if I told you that the marquis visits each day
to nonchalantly inquire about any news I might have
about the girl and her mother?
I'll admit, I didn't expect the marquis to be such easy prey.
Nevertheless, I fear that...
your endeavor is excessive.
My endeavor falls short of my pain, and the blow the marquis dealt me.
Be fair.
Were you not aware of his inconstant nature?
Why be cross with a dishonest man,
if nature has made him that way?
Would it be fair to allow dishonesty to roam at leisure?
My anger is filled with a sense of justice.
I don't seek revenge.
In me, I see the female gender,
and in him, the male.
To do justice, our heart
must be pure, and free from resentment.
Madame...
purity is what drives me.
If no just souls attempt to improve men,
how can we hope for a better society?
It seems uncharitable to hope for others' suffering.
Open your eyes, my friend, to the human race.
Only pain helps the spirit recognize its errors.
Is it thus out of goodness
that you want to make him suffer?
Yes.
I want to enlighten his mind.
Madame, if you will...
What's wrong?
Tell me, talk to me.
Is it a woman?
I can tell it's a woman.
You love her and she doesn't love you?
Love affairs are always like that.
One always loves too much, and the other, not enough.
My father said nature dislikes equality and enjoys making us fret.
One always has more and the other, less. In every realm and matter.
Even pleasure.
Let's play a game.
Close your eyes and think about her.
Imagine that you're with her,
that... I'm her.
-Come, marquis, make an effort. -No, no, sorry, this won't work,
I can't imagine doing that with her.
It would be an insult to her purity and modesty.
A saintly woman in bed with a man is still a woman.
Oh, not her.
Hello, marquis.
You seem to be doing better than yesterday.
I was afraid you were taking ill.
Look at this little painting. It would go well in your home. No?
Aren't those little sheep charming?
No, marquis, I have no news.
Madame, do you think I might have her portrait?
What an idea. I think you need to rest some more.
I only glimpsed her face once,
and a perfect, albeit vague, image of it
has been engraved upon my mind.
This vagueness is the cause of all my torment, madame.
Possessing a faithful portrait
might cure the excesses of my imagination.
I might even find some imperfections to console me
for being unable to see her again.
You are dreaming, marquis.
How could she offer her face to a painter, when she takes such care to hide it?
It's absurd that religion drives nature's gems
to hide in the shadows. Has one ever seen anything so brutish.
Mind what you say. Some might take offense for a lot less.
I don't care about those who live in the hope of dying well.
Monsieur, are you sure that you are in a fit state to lecture
and proudly speak for libertines?
You've dragged about for weeks, like a sick dog.
I've done everything to forget her.
I tried everything.
The more I tried, the more I remembered.
Madame, grant me one favor.
-What favor? -Take pity on me.
I want to see her again.
It's a difficult matter.
No, marquis, I fear I'd lose their friendship
by helping you.
Oh, no.
Do not abandon me.
I won't be accountable for my actions. I know myself.
These women are dear to you. Spare them the madness I'm capable of.
I'll find them.
I'll send 10, 20, 100 men to find them, but I will find them.
I'll force my way in. I don't know what I'll say or do.
Beware of the violent state I'm in.
You're right.
It's not for you I shall take action, but for them.
I hope at least, Most Honorable Marquis, that you will give me time.
As little as I can, madame.
As little as I can.
Thank you.
Thank you, my friend.
Ladies. Oh, please, stay seated. Eat.
Drink some more wine to console yourselves for all the deprivations
that this penitent's life imposes upon you.
Make the most of the marquis' absence.
I wouldn't be surprised if his impatience made him arrive early.
I can't wait to see the scene he'll put on for us.
In any case, I'm certain I'll appreciate yours, ladies.
My daughter and I have been preparing for several days.
Rest assured that we will do our best.
These clothes suit you so well
that it's hard to imagine you, just a short time ago...
Ladies, the marquis' carriage is approaching.
The Marquis des Arcis asked me to announce his arrival.
He's here. Show him in.
I told him to be surprised to find you here,
and to make polite excuses before accepting my invitation
to join us for dinner.
Let's see how good an actor he is. Do eat.
Marquis.
You, here?
I didn't know you were dining. I'm not dressed appropriately.
I was visiting a friend who wishes to part with his estate not far from here,
and on the way back to Paris I thought that if you found out I had passed by
without greeting you, you'd scold me.
You did well, marquis. You are more than welcome.
Do you know Madame de JoncquiÃ¨res and her daughter?
Oh, have you forgotten?
We met them on a walk in the King's Garden.
No, I remember.
Ladies, I do not wish to interrupt you any longer.
Allow me to retire.
Are you leaving, marquis?
I do not wish to be importunate, madame.
What if I was vexed to see you leave so soon?
Madame, vexing you is the last thing I wish to do.
Before your interruption,
we were talking about these libertine philosophers.
Your timing seems to be perfect.
Why me?
Yes.
You've studied them, haven't you?
No.
-Don't be modest. -Madame.
No, I-- You...
You are mistaken.
Didn't you study them to denounce them better?
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Of course, well...
A little.
Then, marquis, tell us why you think they're so awful.
Know that all of us here think the same as you.
But I...
-I don't... -We were saying that many libertines agree
their philosophy has an advantage over religion
in making man happier. What do you say to that?
Well...
-We're listening. -Yes. So...
Pleasure-- The quest for pleasure...
is the source of all our misfortunes.
Libertines are children.
They think merely of instant gratification.
But for a moment of pleasure,
how many tears and cries?
What a fine image. Isn't it, madame?
Yes, and very true.
Pleasure calls for pleasure. These men are eternally unsatisfied.
And eternally fickle, no?
And eternally sad.
Eternally distraught with their desire? Right?
Indeed.
Monsieur, allow me a question.
Just yesterday my daughter asked if the search for the sublime
was a passion to be fought.
I didn't know what to say.
Mademoiselle...
everything sublime depends on our Creator.
The sublime is not a passion, it is an emotion.
An emotion which crosses our soul, and which, in an instant,
for a dizzy moment,
transports us to absolute truth.
You hear all the subtleties of divine love,
as if your only food had been the Scriptures.
Weren't you tempted to join holy orders?
Forgive me, madame.
I had forewarned that this dinner would be brief,
our days are so ordered.
Don't worry, you did warn me.
I would regret if you were to neglect your duty because of me.
But first, madame, I want to give you this text I told you about earlier.
Come with me.
Mademoiselle...
I hope I answered your questions.
Yes, monsieur.
You know, souls who are interested in the sublime
are the finest.
Mademoiselle.
Your mother is waiting for you.
Goodbye, madame.
Goodbye, monsieur.
Goodbye, mademoiselle.
What a wonderful child.
Yes, I agree.
-How was I? -You were perfect, marquis,
I was delighted and almost convinced by your arguments.
Why did they leave so soon? Couldn't you have made them stay a while?
Well, criticism is my only reward.
What woman in Paris would do as much?
Oh, sorry, madame. There is not another like you.
You're my only true friend in this world. I'm a monster of ingratitude.
What is the state of your heart?
I must have that girl,
or I will perish.
My friend, I advise you to drive out that thought.
Ladies, we've met before, haven't we?
Yes, we dined together at Madame de La Pommeraye's.
I say, ladies.
What a happy coincidence.
We left it sealed, so you could read it first.
The priest gave it to you?
Yes, madame.
He gave it to her after confession,
requesting she open it in secret.
How did this man of God justify his gesture?
He said her charms are one of the most dangerous gifts
God can give a woman,
no man would be left indifferent to them,
and men will all try to lead her into temptation.
Then he said only an honest man could protect her.
What a rogue. And what did you say?
I remained silent, madame.
He added that the Lord watched over her,
as a gentleman known to him, with the finest of souls,
had noticed her, and been moved by her gracious devotion.
Dear marquis, that is how you finance the Church.
Good. Very good. I'm pleased.
Keep going to church. If the priest asks you for an answer,
say that you gave the letter to your mother,
who burnt it in front of you.
What an imbecile I was. I'm desperate, madame.
I beg you. I need you.
Advise me. How do I approach and talk to them without offending them?
Rest assured, I'll do nothing without your consent.
Marquis, there's nothing more to do.
You won't have that girl. It's all over.
Madame, forgive me, for coming here in this way.
But I knew no other way to speak to you.
I can imagine how embarrassed my letter to your daughter made you, but...
please, believe me when I say it was inspired by the most sincere
and most honest feelings.
Know that my intention is to offer your daughter
the finest surroundings.
I wish to keep her pure soul safe
from this world full of cruelty and vice, madame.
No other face ever inspired such goodness in me.
Madame, here is a letter of guarantee,
which entitles you to an income of 600 Louis.
You may dispose of it as you wish.
If not for your comfort, which you despise,
you may spend it on the unfortunates, for whom you pray so much.
Mademoiselle...
for you, here are some diamonds, chosen for their purity...
as a token of the purity of my affection.
Goodbye, ladies.
My life is in your hands.
Madame, don't you think we should accept?
Are you inclined to accept?
Yes, Madame, with your permission.
No. We're not there yet.
What more can we hope for?
It's a lot for women like us.
No, it's not enough.
This income would ensure our happiness, Madame.
Well, I say it's not sufficient.
I fear it is risky to hope for more.
Sit down.
Take this pen and paper,
and write a reply to him, full of pride and indignation.
I will give it to him.
Say nothing.
I'm just too kind, marquis.
You're plotting behind my back, and I should keep quiet?
If you'd seen how offended those poor ladies were by your gesture.
I introduced you as...
my friend, and the most honest of men.
I felt so ashamed.
Forgive me, madame.
Madame. Do forgive me, I beg you.
As this girl is beautiful and virtuous, must you become her persecutor?
How did I deserve to become your accomplice?
Come, marquis, throw yourself at my feet, beg for forgiveness,
and promise to leave my sad friends in peace.
Forgive me, madame. A thousand pardons.
Help me, I beg you.
Love is a curse. It changes our nature.
I must have that girl. I must have her.
Look at what I have become.
Have pity, please. Help your friend.
I already told you. Nothing can be done. Forget her.
Here are the deeds to two houses,
and an income three times greater than the previous one.
Well, madame?
What do you think?
Madame, can you not tell me something which lets me hope, or despair?
Madame, is it too little for you?
When I left you last time,
I told you that my life depended on you.
Maybe I should have specified, it wasn't just about my destiny,
but about my entire health.
May God let me see you again soon.
Stop those tears. Write, madame.
I beg you, madame, I beg you.
He's sacrificing half his fortune. Isn't that enough?
Only a prince could be as generous.
The offer is too much for you, too little for me.
Just write.
Have mercy, madame, please.
Start writing, madame. You will be rewarded, I assure you.
Marquise, you've driven this man crazy.
You can congratulate yourself on your vengeance.
Congratulate myself now?
When my goal is so close?
Why? Haven't you achieved it yet?
No.
You're being very mysterious.
Do you seek to persuade him to give away more of his fortune?
Do you seek to ruin him?
What more do you want?
I don't know what you have in mind, but you seem sure of yourself.
Be careful.
Savor this victory over the marquis, and don't ask for more, trust me.
How many kings have perished from too much assurance?
Madame, I'm already dead.
What more is there to fear?
Marquis.
You're already back from your lands.
Didn't you intend to stay a year?
Do solitude and books bore you?
Madame, the three weeks there were like three years.
I'm not happy anywhere.
I've decided to commit the greatest folly for a man of my age and rank.
Madame, I shall wed.
Marquis. The matter is serious, and calls for careful thought.
I have but one tenacious thought. I can't be more unhappy than I am now.
You could be wrong.
This is why I'd like you...
to negotiate on my behalf, madame.
Go and see the mother and daughter, question the mother,
sound out the girl's heart, and tell me what their intentions are.
Tread carefully, marquis.
You're engaging your fortune and reputation.
There's no going back.
Think of the mockery of those close to you
and those who won't understand why you're marrying an impecunious girl.
Know that you'll never be able to promise to wed any other woman,
as you so often did.
Bear in mind, this young woman's charms will fade.
You don't know what her true character is, and yet you will have to suffer it
for the rest of your life.
Madame, I've been over it in my mind, time and time again.
You are a good friend
to want to rip this unfortunate passion from my heart.
But to do that, you'd have to rip out my heart.
Thank you, madame, thank you.
Congratulations, mademoiselle.
Madame was right.
Our patience has been rewarded a thousand times over. My child.
The marquis wishes to marry you.
Why this look, my child?
Rejoice with me.
What's worrying you?
Not only are we gaining a fortune, but also a name.
Mother.
There was never any question of marriage.
I thought Madame just wanted
to make the marquis pay for his fickleness.
Madame loves us.
Her goodness to you has overcome her resentment for the marquis.
Forgive me.
You want me to be grateful to her, but I can't.
-I don't like that woman. -How dare you say that?
Wasn't Madame touched by our misfortune? Has she not been good to us?
But aren't we good to her?
My girl, don't forget where we come from.
I haven't forgotten.
But at least there our clients weren't fooled about what we were.
Madame devised this marriage for your own good.
What good do you see in marrying a man we're deceiving?
You'll secure an honorable position.
Is it honorable to betray a sacrament, and spend one's life lying to a man?
Forget the sacrament.
Every marriage is an arrangement,
and there's nothing wrong with that.
It will restore your dignity, your freedom.
What dignity in pretending to love?
Arrangements give rise, over time, to feelings.
Your heart may grow fonder.
If I grew fond of the marquis,
my destiny would only be all the more painful.
Why do you say that?
If it's cruel to deceive an innocent man,
it's all the worse to deceive a man whom you love.
Can one love someone and lie to him?
Mother...
if only the marquis knew who we were...
He might kill us.
Madame.
You've said nothing all day. You seem so far away.
Forgive me, monsieur.
Did you like the ceremony?
Yes, monsieur.
You look pale. Are you well?
Yes, monsieur.
I'll let you go back to your rooms.
Send for me whenever you wish.
Wait.
May I see you smile?
Thank you.
Please, leave me with my daughter.
One last precaution, my girl. I brought you this.
Don't forget that the marquis thinks you're pure.
Feign innocence as much as you can, and take this,
so, he has no suspicions, concerning your virginity.
Put some on the sheets.
My girl...
I don't understand.
Haven't you been through far greater trials than this?
No, Mother.
I've never known anything worse.
I think...
the Lord is punishing me for playing his devoted servant.
Keep your voice down.
Leave the Lord out of this.
He doesn't bother to come to our rescue when we implore him.
Why would he concern himself with punishing us?
What are you afraid of?
I thought the marquis wasn't detestable to you.
I suffer from finding myself detestable.
Pull yourself together.
And listen to me.
I don't glory in all these arrangements, but put aside this disgust of lies,
and deceit.
The world is built on lies.
It's how it was made. We must make the best of it.
Generations of men and women have managed before us.
You'll manage, too.
I'm sure of it.
Madame...
from one day to the next, you suddenly find yourself
in the house and bed of a man who is still a stranger to you.
Don't worry.
The purity you have preserved won't be taken from you.
Not before you feel the same
sweet inclination as myself, which transports two lovers in pleasure.
I will not do anything, madame, to force your sensibility, nothing.
Get to know me.
Hello, my dear friend.
You are very cheerful, marquis.
My modesty forbids me from asking the cause.
No, you are wrong.
Is it the effect of her delicacy, or her noble soul?
I refused to be the vulgar husband, eager to enjoy his rights.
You are mocking me.
On the contrary. I'm rejoicing.
It would seem that purity is contagious.
Or there's a delight in delaying one's satisfaction.
Yes, indeed.
One's satisfaction is often equal to one's patience.
You haven't forgotten that I've come to take you and your little family away.
No, I was expecting you. I found it such a sweet idea.
I can't wait to be in the King's Garden. That is where you're taking us?
Yes. That's where I'll give you my wedding present.
I'm proud to remember
that you met your wife in that very garden.
My wife.
That word still seems very strange and new.
You will get used to it.
Why don't you get married?
To whom?
And who will swear fidelity to me?
It seems one can do without a husband's fidelity.
Yes, but if mine were unfaithful,
I may be strange enough to take exception to it.
And I'm vindictive.
You would get revenge, naturally.
Anyway, we could get a mansion together.
The four of us would be the most pleasant company.
That sounds wonderful, but I'm not getting married.
The only man I might have been tempted to marry is...
Me?
I can admit it to you now, without any fear.
Why didn't you tell me?
It appears I did well not to.
The one you married suits you better in every way.
My dear wife.
You haven't forgotten that the marquise has a surprise for us?
She's taking us for a walk down memory lane.
Well, let's go.
Well, marquise,
I found the ceremony yesterday was very beautiful,
and a great success.
There was a blend of simplicity, grace, and gravity,
which gave it a very special glow.
Did you feel it from where you were sitting?
Yes, marquis.
You can be proud of the ceremony. It made a great impression.
I hope you'll remember it for a long time.
No doubt about it.
Which way is your coachman going to get to the King's Garden?
Don't worry, he knows shortcuts.
Without wishing to vex you, I assure you, your coachman misheard you.
He heard me very well.
Be patient, we're almost there.
There.
We have arrived.
Madame, what joke is this?
What are you playing at? Why are we in front of this hovel?
What's wrong?
Why the long faces? What's wrong?
-Madame. -Yes?
Ladies, you get out first.
-Please, Madame. -Out, you two.
Madame, what tone is that to use to my family?
The tone that is suitable for such women.
It's time to get out, ladies.
Go on.
What is the meaning of all this?
To see where your wife and mother-in-law plied their trade
for several years, as Madame and Mademoiselle d'Aisnon.
Madame, I do not understand. Explain yourself.
Your family can explain perfectly well themselves.
Madame?
Madame?
Did the marquise speak the truth?
-Do you know this vice den? -No.
Monsieur, let me explain.
My father was the Baron Obolensky,
and my mother was the Countess of Demontoy.
I was to be married to the Duke of Grimaud, but...
I...
Yes, monsieur.
Madame spoke the truth.
My mother and I worked here.
Not you, my wife.
Yes, monsieur.
And what did you do here?
Answer me.
Whoever so wished could spend the night with us.
If you're all playing a trick on me here,
it's most inappropriate, madame.
Inappropriate?
You think so?
You gained an honest woman,
and you tired of her.
That woman was me.
Out of charity, I made you marry one worthy of you.
You did all this...?
If other women in my situation had enough self-esteem,
they'd do the same,
and men like you would be less common.
-But, Madame, what about our friendship? -What friendship?
Marquis,
your desires keep you so busy,
you don't know how to see into others' hearts,
You can't see past the veil that modesty imposes upon us.
If a tormented soul smiles at you, you smile back,
without imagining the distress which devours it.
So, it was all an act?
Rest assured, it will amuse all of Paris.
Marquis.
Marquis.
Marquis.
Madame, how dare you come to me?
Monsieur, walk on me, crush me, for I have deserved it,
do anything you will, but listen to me.
Madame, withdraw, or fear for your life.
-Have mercy. Listen. -I wish to hear no more.
-Monsieur, give me a moment... -Madame.
Don't touch me, nor come near me again...
or I won't answer for my actions.
Madame...
Why?
Why did you betray us?
I didn't betray you.
Do not worry. I'll keep my promise. A handsome sum awaits you.
I'm talking about our honor.
My daughter's honor,
you promised you would save.
Isn't it a great honor to have been my accomplices?
You, who were betrayed by a man,
rejoice that you have been part of this plan.
Tell yourself that if all women acted like us,
the honor of being a woman would be greater.
Marquis, I sympathize with you.
I also find it unfair that these women, who are so often honored,
can dishonor you thus.
Don't let it get you down.
Shake off this serious frown, forget what people say,
become your old light-hearted self.
Move out of the way. Out of the way. Out of the way.
Let me into my own home. Let me through.
These men just brought her back.
They fished her out of the Seine. She's still breathing.
What are you waiting for? Get all these people out.
I believe these men are waiting for a reward.
It's a lot to pay for a whore.
I had her for less.
I hope she looked better.
Go on, gentlemen.
Get out.
Out.
I'm hungry. Serve me some food.
What now?
What?
She recovered for an instant, then passed out again almost immediately.
For now, the doctor doesn't know if she'll survive.
Stop.
Something else, please.
No.
Something else.
Go see what that was.
Monsieur, it's Madame.
She ran away while a chambermaid slept.
-You let her get away? -We soon took her back to bed.
-You're sure she wanted to run away? -Certain, monsieur.
Light my study. Tell my wife, I wish to see her immediately.
Come in.
I thought if you had enough strength to run away,
you might still have some left to listen to me.
My honor prevents me from leaving my wife and her mother
with no money or roof over their heads on the streets of Paris.
You may tell your mother,
she will be given a house in Rouen and an income.
Thank you, monsieur. Thank you.
I am not finished.
Come here and sit down.
No, monsieur, I can't.
I'm not worthy...
to come near you, or for you to approach me.
-You said so yourself. -Madame, I regret it.
I don't think you're wicked.
You were led into a vile act, out of weakness and authority.
Didn't you lie and agree to marry through constraint?
Yes, monsieur.
My reason and my principles aren't those of all my contemporaries.
I'm opposed to union without inclination.
I give you back your freedom.
You may keep my name, and live where you wish.
Think it over, and let me know.
Monsieur...
Give me the darkest corner of your house, where you would let your wife reside.
I'll stay there without a murmur.
Madame, you don't understand. You are free.
I'll only be free when you can judge my behavior...
when you can look into my heart, and see how much I hate lies.
I'll be free the day you see how far from me my past faults are.
Madame, I believe you are sincere.
And if my mouth ever uttered...
a single humiliating word...
I am sorry, madame.
Rest assured...
that never more...
will my wife hear another hurtful word.
I can hide from your view forever.
Say the word, I will go.
Your happiness isn't compromised. Just forget me.
Madame, I have forgiven you, I told you.
I see you don't believe me.
Madame.
Madame. Madame.
Madame, I beg you.
Madame, stand up.
Come now, marquise. Come, madame.
Come. Come.
Madame des Arcis.
Wait for me, I'll be right back.
Madame.
-Are you leaving Paris? -Well, madame,
has Madame de La Pommeraye sent you to spy on me?
You must be joking, marquis.
You know I am a friend of the baroness.
There's no need to spy on you.
The rumors are so full of details.
Marquis, you should know me better.
My friendship with Madame de La Pommeraye does not make me her accomplice.
Your misfortune does not delight me in the slightest.
My wife and I are leaving Paris for the country.
We will stay till we can return without any repercussions
for either her or myself.
Fresh scandal chases away the old.
Be patient, marquis. People will forget you.
Thank you, madame.
I nearly forgot.
If you see Madame de La Pommeraye again,
thank her.
Thank her?
By taking revenge, she did me a favor.
-What favor are you talking about? -The best one can do to two people.
I'd be a fool to blame Madame de La Pommeraye's resentment.
Without it, I wouldn't have met my wife.
Oh, I...
I went to see the baroness last week.
Oh, really? How is she?
Very well. Very well.
I haven't seen her in ages.
Is she in the same house?
Oh, yes.
The one opposite the Marquis des Arcis.
That's right.
In fact, I came across him that day.
Who?
Well, the Marquis.
Really?
Did you speak with him?
Maybe I'm being too curious, but...
you're my friend.
He was leaving to go to the country. He was just getting into his carriage.
He came over to greet me.
Was he alone?
Was his wife with him?
No.
I heard his wife was accompanying him.
I remember it clearly. He was alone.
People will invent anything to spread rumors.
He was alone.
As alone as you are here.
If he'd been with his wife, it wouldn't have mattered to me.
[crowd chanting] Leo! Leo! Leo!
One...
two...
three!
[crowd chanting] Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo!
[woman] Leo. Leo. Leo?
[woman] Leo! Leo!
Five more minutes.
[sighing] No, you're gonna be late.
All right.
Ankle lock.
I read that this is how Xavier Woods gets Kofi out of bed before a big match.
[laughing] You did not read that, Grandma.
I did, I read it.
Ah! Okay, okay! I'm up,Â I'm up,Â I'm up.
-Come on, get up. -[knocking on door]
-All right, kiddo. Time to wake up. -I'm up, Dad.
He's already up.
[Denise] And when you get home from school, clean that room.
It's chaos in there, kid.
Thank you. Any chance you made breakfast, Denise?
[Denise] All right! It's Monday morning!
So, are you ready?
You know what they say,
"Monday is one step closer toÂ Friday."
I read that on Instagram.
-You're on Instagram? -Yeah! I've got 300 followers.
Your grandma's about to be an influencer.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Nice choice of t-shirt.
Hi, Kofi. How're you doing?
Can you do me a favor
-and not flirt withÂ my t-shirts? -I will second that.
All right, all right.  I'm working on myself.
-So, are we gonna watch Raw tonight? -You know it.
Okay. Well, in that case, I will see you later.
Sounds good.
-I was talking to Kofi. -You're gross.
All right, I love you. Have a good day at school.
[Leo] Bye, Dad. Bye, Grandma.
-How late were you driving that Lyft? -Mmm.
Really late.
The good news is, though,
that now I get to go to my second job.
[sighs] Steve, it seems like you're burning the candle at both ends. You look tired.
I am tired. I'm exhausted.
But I gotta do what I gotta do.
And I can fix cars inÂ my sleep.
Well, don't work on anybody's brakes today.
[Riyaz] Hey, you guys see WWE's feed this morning?
What do you guys think the announcementÂ is gonna be?
Personally, I hope it's something to do with themÂ looking for a new director.
Here we go.
Look, I'm just saying. There has to be a director backÂ there,
calling out the camera angles, the shots.
Yes, there is. His name is Vince McMahon.
Well, I think Mr. McMahon would love my ideas.
For example, what about a match filmed entirely by drones?
Drones. Always with the drones.
Look, I'm just passionate about my craft. You're not passionate about anything.
I'm passionate about plenty of things.
Snorkeling, slam poetry,
wondering if Ariana Grande ever thinks her high ponytail is a little too high.
Speaking of announcements, you gonna do it?
-What, the talent show? -No.
Wrestling.
You love it more than any of us.
No. I love WWE more than any of us.
Different story.
Also, look at me.
-Yeah, I agree. -Good point.
You'll get trampled.
Of course, little Leo won't sign up for the wrestling team.
Yeah. Of course, little Leo won't sign up for the wrestling team.
I, however, I'm all over this. Mason...
pen me.
[Trevor] Book bomb! [laughs]
-Whoa! -Come on.
Aw. Look at this.
Does our little Leo want to be a WWE Superstar? [laughing]
Give that back. Come on.
One, two, three.
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!
Wow. Trevor, Mason,Â and Luke.
Giving people a hardÂ time. How shocking.
Principal's office, now.
Here you go, nerd.
Gentlemen, Raw tonight.
New Day versus TheÂ Usos.
New Day's winning, no question.
"No question"?
But it's The Usos.
It doesn't matter. I'm picking New Day every time.
Kofi Kingston is amazing.
Trouble in Paradise is the best finishing move on the planet.
[Caleb] I'm sorry, but that's crazy talk.
What about Ricochet's 630 Splash?
[Riyaz] What about AJÂ Styles' Phenomenal Forearm?
[Caleb] Earth to Leo. Hello?
[sighing] Great. Just great.
Yeah, today is not your day.
Look who it is.
Okay, seriously?
-Hey! -Oh, hi.
Hey, hey!
You three need a hobby or something.
[Trevor] Uh, look, Miss Cartwright.
Don't worry, everything's cool.
Uh, Leo was just educating us on the proper way to eat
-spaghetti. -Spaghetti.
Yeah. Isn't that right, big guy?
Well, uh... guess we better head home.
-Yeah. Better get going. -Yeah, yeah.
-Lots of homework to do. -Yeah. Straight A's.
-All right. -Bye!
I fear for our future.
[Trevor] We're gonna get you, Thompson!
-[Mason] Go, go! -Okay!
[man] Hey, hey! No kids allowed without parents!
[Trevor] Come on! Get him!
You hear that?
[man] Excuse me.
This area is off-limits.
Oh, sorry, sir. We were just admiring the beautiful doors.
Great doors.
[man] I'm sure you were.
I need you to leave now.
Whoa.
Ugh, it stinks.
Hey!
Are you with those other delinquents?
No, I was just...
They were chasing me.
I see.
Well, they're gone now.
And what do you have there?
I found this really cool wrestling mask in this weird secret compartment. [man] Oh.
Do you know whose it was?
No.
It certainly smells authentic.
-It sure does. -[man] Hmm.
Do you want it?
Because if you don't, I'll have to burn it.
Thank you!Â Wow.
What about that Ric Flair robe?
Don't push your luck, kid.
And don't tell anybody about the mask. You'll get me into trouble.
[Denise] Oh, Denise, you look good.
Okay.
Yeah, there's the money shot.
All right.
#outfitoftheday,
#vintagestoreowner,
and #blessed.
Post.
Grandma's about to be an influencer, baby.
How was your day, Kid Chaos?
Um, the usual.
Uh-oh. Was it Trevor?
You just let me know. I'll come up to that school
and open up a can of you-know-what, okay?
Stone Cold Steve Austin-style.
Your granny got hands. [laughs]
No, I'm good.
You sure?
'Cause you know I'll do anythingÂ for you,Â babe.
What is that smell?
Uh... what smell?
I don't smell smell.
I smell something. It doesn't smell right. Is that you?
I don't smell.
You know, I sell clothesÂ that people have literally died in. I know that smell.
-Did you shower today? -Yes.
-It's not me. -Ugh. [sniffing]
I smell something.
Well, it ain't me!
[Leo] Ooh, get him, Kofi.
[Denise] Ooh! Am I missing it?
Oh! Yes!
You go, Big E!
Ooh, don't let him hurt that big, beautiful, sexyÂ body.
You're so weird.
What?
Come on! Get up, Big E!
I wish I could be as strong as Kofi.
Everything would be so much better.
No.
Believe me, kiddo. Life isn't all about being strong.
Well, not physically, at least.
Gotta be strong mentally,
and emotionally.
Trust me, that's what matters.
Mom says that all the time.
Or she did. AtÂ least, when she was here.
Listen, your mom was right.
And just because she's not here does notÂ mean that she doesn't love you.
Never forget that, all right?
Give me some.
And hey, Big E! You never forget that Grandma is here,
willing and ready and waiting for you, baby.
You are so fine!
Grandma, seriously, please.
What? He's cute.
Hey, you guys. Sorry I'm late.
The garage was a mess today.
Denise.
Stephen.
Oh, look, Dad. It's the best part.
Oh, yeah. This is where Big E makes his pecs bounce.
Up and down, up and down. Oh, my God, it drives me wild.
Go, Big E! Whoo! Yes!
For the record, we have different opinions on what the best part is.
Dad, remember when you said every wrestler hasÂ a weakness?
I guess I did say that, yeah.
Well, I think Jimmy Usos' is his temper.
[Leo] Oh! See? Look!
He ran straight into Kofi. He wasn't thinking straight.
-Yeah, that is very cool, man. -[laughs]
Very cool.
Ooh. Look. They're about to make a big announcement.
WWE Universe, I'm the A-Lister.
The most must-see WWE Superstar in history, The Miz,
and the time has finally come.
You have aÂ once-in-a-lifetime chance to become theÂ next NXT Superstar.
So if you think you have what it takes,
get your butt down to Fallbridge.
Uh... I'm sorry, hang on. Fallbridge?
Yes, Fallbridge.
Fallbridge?
That's right. Fallbridge.
The WWE is hosting a winner-take-all tournament,
where two finalists will square off inside a steel cage.
The winner will receive not only an NXT contract,
but a $50,000 cash prize.
So don't Miz out
onÂ this awesome opportunity.
The WWE is coming right here to Fallbridge?
-What? Yeah, baby! -Yeah!
Hey...
Where is my bread?
It was stale. I threw it out.
Oh! Becky Lynch. Yes!
Dad, remember that time we went to Raw, and Mom met Becky Lynch after the show?
Yes, I do remember that.
That was a veryÂ fun time for your mother.
You know what? It's fine.
I have like two or three emergency sandwiches
hidden in the kitchen somewhere.
[Denise] You can't keep doing that.
You change the topic every time he brings up his mother,
or run out to the garage and work on that car.
Well, what happened with Rachel is a sensitive subject,
and I'm just not quite sure how to broach it.
[Denise] How would you know that?
You avoid talking to him.
[Steve] To my credit, I only avoid talking to him
about hisÂ mother leaving him.
[Denise] Steve, Rachel leaving was a surprise to all of us.
-[Steve groans] -[Denise] You gotta unpack this.
[Steve] Can we talk about anything else? Please?
I mean, there are 1,000 things that I would rather do,
than talk about my wife leaving me for someone else,
with her mother.
You know, it may not mean much, but I, um...
adjusted my schedule just to take a fewÂ weeks off
to come here and try to help you through this.
And I appreciate that.
Look, as soon as I can pay down the bank,
I will stop driving Lyft.
I will go from two jobs to one job,
and I will find some semblance of normalcy.
Whatever that looks like now.
But I still owe the bank like $20,000.
If I don't pay it soon, I...
I might lose the house.
[Denise] I told you. I'll take out a second mortgage on the store.
[Steve] No. Come on, I can't. This is my mess. I'll clean it up.
What the...
Ugh. It's getting worse.
[deeper voice] Ooh. Fits perfect.
Although, it's almost a crime to hide this studly face from the world.
Sorry, ladies.
[regular voice] What was that?
[deep-voiced] That was just you being you, big man.
You're a limousine-riding, jet-flying cool dude
with a larger-than-life personality.
[regular voice] I wet the bed until I was eight.
[deep-voiced] I wet the bed until I was eight.
[regular voice] Why did that sound so much cooler?
[deep-voiced] Are you ready to face the man of the hour?
The man with the power, the guy who's too sweet toÂ be sour? Ooh!
What a rush!
Oh, no, no, no!
What?
Shoot! My favorite shirt.
I've been all around the world rocking ringsÂ across the globe,
and I have never seen a sorrier sight than you.
What's that?
Bring it? [chuckles]
Oh, your boy's about to.
"Legend has it that this mask's mystical powers
only work for competitors who are truly deserving of its magic.
The mask itself decides who is worthy.
The mask was last seen 50 years ago."
Whoa.
[Trevor] Your little buddy Leo ran away from us.
So now, we're gonna have to take out our frustrations on you two. [both grunting]
Guys, just relax.
[Trevor] I'm gonna break your face, nerd.
[Riyaz] I prefer the term "intellectually advanced person."
Trevor, seriously. Not cool.
[Riyaz] Guys, somebody!
Yeah, Trevor. Not cool.
I think you should leave them alone.
All right. Fine.
I'll leave them alone.
You, however, are a different story.
[Luke] Whoa! -Hey! -Wait, no!
Trevor, Mason, and Luke.
Principal's office, now.
What?
But we're the ones hanging by our underwear.
Leo? Principal's office. Now.
Uh, which way is it?
Second door to the left, right before theÂ bathrooms.
Got it.
-[clapping] -Leo!
[girl] Go, Leo!
What were you thinking? Huh?
There's three of them.
They could have really hurt you.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Just promise me no more fighting. Okay?
You're better than that.
You're better than them.
They're bigger than you, sure, but you'reÂ stronger than them.
In here and in here.
All right?
Wow, that was really sweet, man.
You are definitelyÂ getting five stars. Yeah.
[Riyaz] That was the coolest thing ever today.
I guess that was pretty cool.
My dad didn't like it, though.
Who cares?
The whole school is talking about it.
-Really? -[Riyaz] Yeah, dude.
How'd you do it, though?
It seemed physically impossible, no offense.
Well...
Oh, look! SmackDown's back on.
Tomorrow in Fallbridge, WWE kicks offÂ its search
to find the next NXT Superstar.
But one man has alreadyÂ registered.
Or should I say one monster?
The entire WWE roster should be shaking in their boots right now,
because Samson has arrived, baby!
Remember the name. Samson.
And also Frankie Albano.
That's me,Â I'm his manager. Remember that name, too.
Both names.
Dude, he's huge. He's gotta be a shoo-in for that $50,000.
Fifty thousand dollars.
[deep-voiced] All you jabronis better know your role, and stay out of my lane.
[regular voice] I look ridiculous.
[deep-voiced] "Cowabunga, dude!"
"I came here to chew bubblegum and kick butt,
but I'm all out of bubblegum."
Thompson. Leo Thompson.
"Can you smell...
what Leo is..."
No. I can't pull that one off.
"This is Sparta!"
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
your champ is here.
Yeah. [chuckles]
[scoffs] Chuck E. Cheese is a block over, kid.
Now I'm hungry.
Here we go.
[woman] Next!
You're a little small for this, aren't you?
You know what they say.
"Great things come in small packages."
Whatever. What is your wrestling name?
My wrestling name...
Okay, come on. If you wanna compete, I need a name.
And you should really think about changing,
'cause you will be on television.
My name is Kid Chaos.
Next!
Get out of my seat, you little worm.
Hey.
Just ignore him, bruh. Come on.
Have a seat here.
They call me Smooth Operator.
But you can call me Smooth.
I'm smooth in the ring,
[sing-songy] and I got this silky smooth voice.
Sweet. I'm Kid Chaos.
I like it. Nice to meet-- [sniffs]
It smells like old bus seats.
-["I Came to Play" by Jim Johnston] -It's on.
Who here is ready to be a Superstar?
-[all whooping] -Yeah!
That's right. I'm The Miz. It is my pleasure
to welcome you to this winner-take-all NXT competition.
I'll be your awesome host, watching on as we...
-Heard from Leo? -No, I did not.
...will then have three weeks of bone-crushing bouts
with theÂ final two meeting inside a steel cage--
What is that?
Wow, he's huge!
Dude, he's massive!
Uh, sorry we're late, but I had to feed the beast.
He had four whole chickens for lunchÂ today.
Yeah. You should've seen the look on the chicken's faces.
Have a seat.
Oh, my gosh. Look at this motley crew.
This is gonna be easier than I thought.
You know what? I'm just kidding.
Good luck... to none of youse.
We prefer to stand.
-Are you done? -I am, yes. Thank you very much.
Okay, well.
Let's get started!
-[announcer] Barrel Toss. -["Reyna" by NiÃ±a Dioz playing]
[announcer] Beat the Dummy.
-Wow! -Awesome!
[announcer] Agility Test.
Let's see how you guys are on the top rope.
[The Miz] Come on, big guy. Gotta go all the way to the top.
Or not.
All right, Kid Chaos. Your turn to show off thoseÂ skills.
Whoa.
-Whoa. -Whoa.
[The Miz] And the next finalist is...
Smooth Operator!
â™ª Thank you, MizÂ â™ª
Can you not do that?
And the last finalist moving on to the tournament is...
Kid Chaos!
[cheering] Yeah!
Way to go, bro.
Miz, you made the right choice.
Because I'm the best there is, the bestÂ there was,
and the best there ever will be.
Chaos rules!
And there they are, folks.
Your 16 tournament competitors. -[grunts] -Whoa!
[Denise] Little late, isn't it?
[Denise] So this is a stinky mask with powers. Hmm.
You can't tell Dad. He'll kill me.
Baby, you found a magical mask.
It's not like you got a D in science.
I know, but...
I can win $50,000,
and then we can keep the house.
I overheard you and Dad talking.
Look, Leo,
that is not your concern, okay?
You're 11 years old, and I'm sure your dad will figure out a way to save the house.
and I'm sure your dad will figure out a way to save the house. Or IÂ will.
But what if this is the way?
Not just to save the house. To fix everything.
If I won the money,
Dad won't have to work so much. And who knows?
Maybe Mom will even come back.
Oh, baby.
If I let you do this...
you cannot get hurt, or I will kill you.
I won't, Grandma.
With this mask, it's like...
like I really am a WWE Superstar.
It somehow takes what's inside of me and makes itÂ awesome.
Like, I can say or do anything.
All right.
Just please promise me you'll be careful.
I said promise.
I promise.
[school bell ringing]
[Riyaz] Dude, where were you last night?
I, um... didn't feel well.
Man, you missed out.
I still don't know who I'm rooting for.
Definitely not Samson. He sucks.
Smooth Operator seems kind of cool.
I like the little guy. Kid Chaos.
Oh, yeah. He's crazy strong for his size.
Hey, uh... creepy staring guy?
Why don't you go talk to her?
Oh, no. I can't do that.
She's like smart and cool and popular.
She's just a person.
Then you go talk toÂ her.
Yeah, I don't see myself doing that.
Why is that? No passion?
Come on, dude. You were strong enough to take on Trevor and Mason.
You can talk to Erica.
Just... summon that guy.
[Kid Chaos] Some say a life without books is a life not worth living.
[Kid Chaos] Some say a life without books is a life not worth living. [Erica] Huh?
Who is that?
What up? Leo Thompson here.
You sound different.
Um, just a little cold.
Don't wanna get you sick. Wouldn't be cool.
Hey, that's a great book.
You've read Percy Jackson?
Are you kidding? I love Rick Riordan.
Have you read The Trials of Apollo?
That's my jam right there.
Cool.
So, Erica, I've noticed we're in a few classesÂ together.
I was wondering if you wanna get our study on sometime?
I mean... I guess.
Sure.
Um... actually, how about we talk on the phone?
I'm free tomorrow.
I'll call you at four.
Perfect. Talk to you then.
[softly] Yes!
[Steve] All right, family.
I hope you are hungry [with Italian accent] because I have made for you,
an authentic Italian feast. Huh?
[regular accent] Daddy's special cooking.
Dig in.
All right.
Real authentic. I feel like I'm in Tuscany.
Denise... I'll ask you to hold your sarcasm, please,
because clearly my son enjoys my cooking. Wow, you really...
You're very hungry. Are you okay?
Well... I've been burning a lot of caloriesÂ lately.
Must be all that brain busting I'm doing at school.
Well, I did piledrive you to the library yesterday.
My teacher got a real super kick out of me doing all that extra credit.
Well, there's no way you're gonna powerbomb your next big test.
-Yeah. -[Denise chuckles]
Also...
I...
At work today, I, um...
put the sleeper hold on the brake line of a 1988 ToyotaÂ Tercel, so...
I'mma eat the salad.
[cheering]
[The Miz] WWE Universe, it's time.
Our 16 competitors are jacked up and ready to do this.
[groaning]
One, two, three!
-[bell dings] -[announcer] Next upâ€¦
Big Billy Beavers!
Yo, Kid Chaos.
Huh, congrats, Smooth.
Oh, thanks, bro. How're you feeling?
I feel like I'm about to hop on a lightning bolt,
and ride it like a bucking bronco.
[laughs] Yeah!
And his opponent...
Kid Chaos!
Baby! Come on, Chaos!
Kid Chaos! Whoo!
Stay down, little dogie!
Hey! Hey! Don't you touch my baby!
One, two...
That's right! Get him, baby, get him!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hey! Hey! Stop!
One, two, three!
-Yeah! -[bell dings]
Chaos! Chaos!Â Chaos!
Chaos! Chaos! Ah!
So good I gotta get the selfie!
Whoo!
[crowd chanting] Chaos! Chaos!
[continues] Chaos! Chaos! Chaos!
[continues] Chaos! Chaos! Chaos! [chanting fades]
Erica, good to hear from you.
How's it going out there?
I'm sure you're crushing it.
[Denise] Leo, come down here!
-Oh-- -[Erica] Hey, Leo.
[Leo] Huh. Erica...
Oh. Hey. What are you doing here?
I know I said I'd call, but I take dance lessonsÂ right down the street,
so I figuredÂ I'd just come over. Is that okay?
Of course, it's okay. It's fine, sweetie. [laughs]
Yeah, it's totally okay. I just, uh...
Uh... give me a second, okay?
You know, that is so crazy that you're a dancer,
because I'm aÂ dancer, too.
Like, back in the 80s, I was a pop lock master.
Oh, my God. I was so funky fresh.
Tap me.
In your face!
Okay, she's here. In your home.
Okay. Just breathe.
You can do this.
You can be cool.
Yeah.
You can be cool.
You can't be cool. [sighs]
You wanna start with Science?
Yeah, sure. But first, let's get you a drink.
I'm good. I got my water.
So you want another drinkÂ to go with your water. Don't worry, I'm on it.
Totally. Got it.
Sorry if I was a little jumpy there.
Not usually my style.
In fact, some people say I'm cool as the other side of the pillow.
What people say that?
What?
And since I don't want to get you sick with my cold,
I think I should maybe stay in here while we work.
But first, let's get you a drink.
Grandma's lemonade.
Erica, I think this stuff is really gonna knock your socks off.
Sounds great.
Hey! Um, look who it is.
What is that smell?
Oh, the smell? What smell?
That smell's me.
Never buy perfume off the backÂ of a truck.
Anyway, um...
Here, you'll like this. It's...
lemony and, uh, fullÂ of lemons.
They're ripe and stuff, and it's like... squeeze it.
[laughs] You're funny.
Should we go start studying?
Yeah... let's get to it.
[crowd chanting] Chaos! Chaos!
No lassos this time, Tiny Dancer.
Just you and me.
Whatcha gonna do?
First off, jabroni,
I'm gonna try to touch you as little as possible,
-while doing this. [yells] -[growls]
The match just started. How are you so sweaty?
Don't ask questions you don't want answers to.
It's in my mouth!
It's in my mouth!
Time to squash the worm!
I think it's time to start cooking...
with gas!
Nope. Too stinky.
One, two, three!
-Yes! Whoo! -Yeah!
Ah! Unbelievable. I can't...
Let's go. Come on.
[low growl]Â  [crowd chanting] Chaos! Chaos!
[Smooth] So, now it's you versus me to seeÂ who takes on Samson.
[Kid Chaos] It's been a long road, huh?
I've been at this for nearly a decade.
Even started training right out of college.
Whoa! You've been in it for that long?
Yeah, I put in the time, bro.
Even had a couple tryouts for WWE.
I didn't get signed.
So this time, I've gotta win,
and make them sign me.
-I love that commitment. -Thanks.
Nobody wants it more than me.
So, what do you think?
You gonna take it easy on me out there?
Depends. Are you gonna take it easy on me?
-[laughs] -Didn't think so.
May the best man win.
-Fair enough. It was worth a try. -[chuckling]
What?
The lighting is better over here.
My followers demand excellence.
You know, at this point, your followers are pretty much 80% bot.
You're just jealous because I don't follow you back.
No, it's just a fact. We're all pretty much followed by bots.
Hey, hey! How's it going, man?
I, uh...
I was realizing that we haven't spent muchÂ time together, you know?
And... we definitely haven't had time to have aÂ man-to-man conversation, so...
Okay...
Who's Erica? [laughs] Huh?
I mean, I...
Before yesterday, she didn't even exist.
I had to hear about her from...
TMZ over there.
Yeah.
-She's my new friend. -Your new friend?
That's very cool.
Very, very cool.
Well, if you really wanna have a man-to-man talk,
I was thinking, and since Mom's gone and stuff--
I do wanna have a man-to-man talk.
And I was thinking, too, uh, you know,
I haven't had a chance reallyÂ to show you what I do,Â and so I was thinking,
God forbidÂ you break down on the side of the road or something,
you should know what a fuel filter is.
Which is this thing right here.
-So this thing, especially these old-- -Dad.
I'm sorry, but can we maybe do this another time?
I'm supposed to meet with my friends at theÂ diner.
You're going out?
Yeah. Caleb got an A on his Spanish test.
His mom is treating us.
Yeah, man, go. Have fun with your friends.
-Thanks. -Yeah.
-Hey, Dad? -Yeah.
When will I get to see Mom again?
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.
I promise.
Okay.
Have fun. Have a good time.
Celebrate that A!
So, check it.
What if Kid Chaos is actually just Kevin Hart in a mask,
researching a new role?
Maybe he's a method actor.
That's insane. He's not that small.
-Kid Chaos is, like, Leo's size. -Mmm.
Erica, why're you hanging out with these weirdos?
They're notÂ weirdos, they're my friends. And also,
one ofÂ them hung you up by your underpants theÂ other day.
So maybe you should be a little nicer.
Come on, guys. Let's go.
This way!
Idiots.
So, wait. We're like official friends?
I mean, yeah. Do you guys not wanna be--
-No! We totally do! -We do!
-Yeah. -[Erica] Cool.
So, any of you doing the talent show?
I was gonna submit my short film, but I doubt I'll finish itÂ in time.
You haven't even started it,Â man.
That's why I doubt I'll finish it.
[sighs] You infuriate me.
Wait. Are you gonna do it?
Put your dancing lessons to use?
I don't know. It's a big crowd,
and I'd be upÂ there all alone. So...
Well...
what if I dance with you?
Wait, really? You'd do that?
Yeah. You'd do that?
Yeah.
I'm not that great,
but if you want me to, I'll give it a try. I mean...
what are friends for?
Hey, you!
Right here, Pops!
Empty the register now!
[cashier] I am. I am. I am.
The safe, too! Open it!
Let's go!Â Let's go! I ain't got all day!
Okay, don't freak out.
There's a guy robbing the place, and you're telling us not to freak out?
What are you--
[coughing] Leo!
What died?
I'm sorry I didn't tell you guys before, and...
I should have.
Come on, hurry up!
If I gotta ask you one more time, this place is gonna get messy. Let's go!
I'll explain later.
Come on, hurry up!
[cashier] I'm working on it, okay?
Who did that?
Your worst nightmare!
-[boy] It's Kid Chaos! -[girl] Kid Chaos!
Ow! All right!
[Caleb] Whoo! Yeah!
Have fun in jail.
See you in what, five to ten years?
[all chanting] Chaos! Chaos! Chaos!Â Chaos!
So what made you decide to help?
That's just how the people's champ is wired.
When I'm around, crime is down.
Chaos rules.
He's a hero now. [laughing] He's a hero now.
Please turn it off. Turn it off.
Please turn it off.
Can you not destroy everything you touch?
[sighs] I got that on Black Friday.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I cannot watch you eat any more butter.
Please take that outside. Please.
Oh, my God! You...
...are a genius.
Kid Chaos...
you butter watch out.
[laughs] You see what I did there?
You know, let me get this straight.
So Leo tries to open up to you
about hisÂ mom a little earlier, and you just...
told him, "We'll figure it out"?
It is insane to me...
that you do not get...
how these dry quicker...
when they're upside down, because then the water is not in the...
[stammering] It doesn't matter, but, like, gravity is--
Hey! Hey! Don't get mad at me.
-I'm not mad at you. -Yeah, you are.
I'm mad at myself, honestly. I just...
I don't have the answers. I don't...
know when he's going to see Rachel next, and it sucks.
Well, I hate to say it, but Leo needsÂ a little more.
And he's a smart kid.
He can handle it.
You want me to tell him that his mom met someone else and moved to New York?
And apparently doesn't have time to callÂ him?
You think he can handle that?
Okay, yes.
My daughter could use a little help in the mom department.
And yes, she should call more.
This parenting is so hard.
It was so much easier with the two of us, and I...
Honestly, I...
This is gonna be our new normal.
And you gotta stop running from it and hiding out here in the garage.
I am not...
-hiding out here in the garage. -Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.
Yeah, I guess... I guess I am.
Steve, his mother left, but his dad is still here.
I can't believe we're friends with a superhero.
You're like Spider-Man!
Miles Morales Spider-Man,
not Tom Holland Spider-Man.
Or Andrew Garfield. [both] Or Tobey Maguire.
Yes! Thank you.
Bet I'm stronger thanÂ Spider-Man.
Someone's getting cocky.
Dude, we're totally going to your semifinals.
We can be your posse.
We need to make t-shirts, stat.
Let's make a mood board.
So...
were you wearing the mask
when you talkedÂ to me in the library that day?
And at your house?
Yeah, sorry.
I was just trying to make a good impression.
For the record, I prefer the real Leo.
And you know what? I think you kind of inspired me.
I think I'm gonna sign up for the talent show.
Good for you.
I'll take you up on that offer to danceÂ with me.
I don't need you to do much.
Just, you know, bust a few small moves.
Small moves. I can do small moves.
Now he's a dancer.
So cocky.
Yes!
â™ª I'm about to go HAMÂ â™ª [crowd cheering]
[Frankie] I almost feel sorry for her!
Almost!
Come on, Samson! Let's go!
Yes!
Watch out! Uh-oh.
That's your first mistake.
There's your second mistake.
Whoa! That hurts.
One, two, three!
[all] Boo!
Aw, look it. Dad said good luck tonight.
I mean, he meant with the talent show,Â but still.
-[vibrates] -Oh, look...
He's also taking the weekendÂ off.
Maybe you guys can get together and talk?
Chill? Huh?
Yeah, sure. Maybe. I just can't think about that right now.
Right, right, right.
You're right. Time to focus.
Okay, baby. You ready?
Are you kidding?
Kid Chaos is about to check into the Smackdown Hotel,
and take the elevator all the way up to the penthouse,
and do what he does best.
Get the W.
It's almost scary how you do that.
It's cool, though, right?
Yeah.
Chaos time, baby. Come on!
Let's go!
Go get 'em!
What up, Smooth?
What's up, Kid?
Hey. Check this out.
[Kid Chaos] All the fans out there.
And they're here to see us. Crazy.
Yeah. It's so cool.
I've dreamed about this ever since I was ten years old.
Me too.
And now, our last semifinal match of the evening,
with the winner facingÂ Samson next week in a steel cage.
First up...
Smooth Operator!
Showtime.
NXT Universe,
I'm here to show you...
â™ª No one can step to thisÂ â™ª
And no one should sing like that!
You're terrible!
You're terrible! Feast your eyes on a real man!
-Feast your eyesÂ on a real man! -Get out of here! Beat it!
Feast your eyesÂ on that man! Half man, half mountain!
Look at him!
Look-- What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?
Boo to you!
And his opponent, from right here in Fallbridge...
Kid Chaos!
I guess he put on his twoÂ left shoes today. [laughs]
[Smooth] Bro, are you okay?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Of course.
-Okay. -[bell dings]
'Cause it's go time.
Ow-chihuahua!
Hey! They put something on my shoe!
[Frankie] He must've hit his head on theÂ turnbuckle one too many times!
And besides, once the bell rings, the match must go on!
He's right. There's nothing I can do.
Sorry, bro.
Come on! Get up, baby, get up!
I'll bring the chaos, bro.
One, two--
What the--?
Chaos rules?
Show me.
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
-Kick out! -...two...
Hold him down!Â Hold him down!
Smooth Operator, get up!
-...three! -Yes!
What was that, ref? That was a fast count!
-He's going to the finals! -Finals!
Yeah!
I did not put that stuff on my shoe.
Don't worry about it, bruh.
The best man won.
I want everybody in this arena and at home to know something.
Smooth Operator is a good man!
And come next week,
I'm gonna bring a dictionary to the ring.
Because I'm going to teach Samson a newÂ word.
Chaos!
[crowd chanting] Chaos! Chaos! Chaos!
Ah! What're you sneaking up on me like that for?
Donuts go inside. Donuts go inside to the giant man who eats everything.
Kid Chaos. What're you doing to me?
[Erica] I don't even like wrestling.
But, wow!
I think you literally broke the laws of physics.
I mean, what else can you do in that mask?
Fly? Teleport?
It's not that type of magic.
[woman] Excuse me, Kid Chaos?
Sorry to interrupt. We need you for the post-match press conference.
You mean, another public forum to make fun of Samson?
My pleasure.
Wait! Kid Chaos...
The talent show?
Oh, right. Can you give us a minute?
Sure.
Alone? [chuckles]
Oh, yeah.
I'll leave as soon as I'm done.
It's a kid! [muffled] It's a kid.Â It's a kid.
It starts at 6:00 p.m., sharp.
All right. Well, I'll drive you kids there.
Leo, you sure you don't want us to wait with you?
I'm okay. Thanks, Grandma. I've gotta deal with this.
I'll leave right after.
[Denise] Okay, give me some. Ah!
All right, let's go.
Do not take your socks off in my car.
It's a magic mask. It's a magic mask.
So, Samson. How do you feel about the upcoming match?
-[laughing] -Are you excited to be in the finals?
And you can quote him on that.
Thoughts on your opponent here?
Oh, boy! [laughing]
Kid Chaos. Thoughts on Samson?
[Frankie] Yeah...
Kid Chaos.
Why don't you tell us what's going on in that little brain of yours, okay?
And be sure to use your big boy voice.
Frankie. Frankie.Â Frankie.
That's my name said three times.
Do you ever stop talking?
Sometimes.
And do you ever start?
Seriously, what is up with these grunts?
Say one actual word.
I'm begging you.
[gasps] In fact, let's start with an easy one.
Five letters, two syllables.
Loser.
Now you did it.
Now you've done and did it.
-[grunts] -[Frankie] Oh, watch out!
[laughs] Watch out. You got him mad now.
All right, don't hurt 'em, Samson.
Don't hurt these boys.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Samson, a man of no words, no class,
and come Saturday night,
no NXT contract.
All right. Oh, you shook the beehive.
Why are you grabbing me? I didn't break the table. Ow!
Kid Chaos?
We need you to shoot a couple of quick promos for the match. Cool?
Of course.
Great. This way.
-[Frankie] All right, that's enough! -[Samson grunting angrily]
Don't-- Stop breaking-- Oh!
Don't break my stuff!
Come on, stop it! Samson!
Sam-- Oh, not my lamp!
Come on, stop doing that!
-[grunting] -Oh! Not the window!
All right, calm down.
-[yells] -Calm down!Â Calm down!
All right, I'm sorry,Â but calm down.
Calm down. I get it.
He embarrassed you. I get it.
But I... I have some great news.
Kid Chaos...
He's just a kid.
That's right, he's just a kid.
He's just a kid.
That mask he wears?
It has magical powers.
-[groans] -I'm... I know that sounds crazy,
but it's true.
I saw it with my own eyes.
I don't want you to worry. Okay?
Because Frankie Albano...
has got a plan.
Hi!
So tune in Saturday night to watch Kid Chaos
knock Samson out.
Cut!
Great, great. That was gr--
That's how you point, Rog. You see how he pointed there? You see? Uh.
Uh. That was good.
Let's get some alts.
Miss Cartwright, could youÂ move us to the end?
Like, to the very end?
Leo's not here yet.
Still waiting on half your act?
Well, I'll just pop you at the end.
Sounds like a strong finale.
[crowd chanting] Chaos! Chaos!
[man] Kid! Can I get a selfie?
[woman] Hey, can I get a selfie?
Anything for my fans.
-Ooh. [laughing] -Oh, my goodness.
Well, that was... spectacular.
Up next, we have Erica Bartlett and Leo Thompson.
Or Er-- Just Erica Bartlett.
What?
What are you doing?
Waiting for my downbeat.
Five, six, seven...
What?
What?
I don't know any of my friends.
Like, at all!
Get it, girl, get it!
Yeah!
-She's good. -I know.
That was amazing!
Oh, no.
-Thanks, dude. -See ya.
Guys, I am so sorry.
Guys, I am so sorry. The press conference just went onÂ forever.
They wouldn't let me leave.
What?
Oh. That was...
They hounded me. I left as soon as I could.
I will stay here until every last one of you gets a photo.
[Leo] Okay, fine.
Sorry.
I lost track of time.
How'd it go?
It was awful...
until Caleb saved the day.
Hang on, what?
He can dance.
Like, amazingly.
Dancing is my true passion.
Deal with it.
I'm so lost.
Yes, you are.
Come on. Are you seriously mad?
Yeah. You ditched me, and this was allÂ your idea.
I know, but... I was just doing my job, okay?
I mean, it's only a talent show.
I've kind of got more important things going on right now.
Well, hello there, Kid Ego.
Whatever. It's true.
Sorry that I'm Kid Chaos and you're not.
No. What you are is a jerk.
Having some bike trouble, Leo?
Guys, I've had a long night.
We don't care.
Dude, you messed with us.
The only reason I messed with you
is because you always mess with me,
because you can.
That's right.
We can.
Hey, buddy.
Hey, man.
You wanna talk about it?
I can help...
I think.
Growing up is... really hard.
But it does get easier.
And if we're being honest, it does getÂ harder again.
You know, your grandfather and I actually had a greatÂ discussion
about how hard it is to growÂ up...
in the garage working on the Camaro.
I don't wanna work on the stupid car with you, Dad.
That's not really what I meant.
Dad, it is what you meant.
Because whenever things get too serious, you go and work on the car.
Nailed me.
To the core.
Listen, I am--
Please, Dad.
I... I just wanna be alone.
Yeah.
Of course.
I said--
Easy, killer.
Come on.
Talk to me, get your mind right.
I thought the mask would make everything better.
I thought it was gonna fix things,
but I was wrong.
Everything's a mess.
It's so unfair.
Didn't you say the mask
brings out confidence in you?
-Yeah, but-- -No buts.
Come on.
You know, the magical mask is not what makes youÂ strong.
Real strength comes from here... and here.
Dad said something like that the otherÂ day, too.
That's because it's true.
Listen, kiddo. Your dad really loves you.
We both do.
And I know your mom leaving, it's been rough on you.
It's been hard on me, too.
I gotta tell you, it hasn't been easy on your dad, either.
Okay?
Good.
Dad!
Dad--
When you came on stage, I had no clue what was gonna happen.
[Caleb] Yeah, I've been watching you guys rehearse,
so I knew most of it.
I'm pretty vigilant. It was mostly freestyle.
Hey, guys.
Look... I'm sorry.
I was a jerk, and you're my bestÂ friends.
I let all this stuff go to my head.
I was stupid.
Can you forgive me?
Yes. Yes. Yes!
Wait, really?
Yeah. We've been talking, and we've decided,
you can't really judge a man until you've walked a mile in his mask.
Also, I'm an amazing dancer.
I know that seems unrelated, but still,
never forget that.
Thanks, guys.
So, do you still wanna come--
The cage match? Dude, yes!
[Caleb] Keep it down.
[whispering] Cage match? Dude, yes.
[Corey Graves]Â WWE Universe, tonight is the night.
Two rookies will do battle inside of a 16-foot-high steel cage,
vying not only for anÂ NXT contract,
but a $50,000 cash prize.
And one of them might even die.
No. No one's gonna die. That's--
I'm sorry. Have you seen the size of Kid Chaos?
Yeah, but...
Nobody's gonna die, I promise.
But the action is gonna be incredible.
Yes.
-Especially if somebody-- -Renee.
Hey!
Family!
Guess who got Chinese food?
Leo?
Denise?
-[knocks] -Leo?
So, how're you feeling, Kid Chaos?
Good. I just wish Dad could be here.
Okay, okay!  Everybody ready for a big night?
Hey, hey, get out of here!
Relax. Relax.
We know who you are...
Leo.
There he is. Don't worry. Your secret's safe with us, okay?
Seriously, it, uh... it is.
It is?
Yeah, it is. Go get something to eat.
Look...
I'm not here to start any trouble, I comeÂ in peace.
[chuckling] Okay?
But I'm a competitive guy.
And you're a competitive guy.
We're all competitive people, okay? It's human nature.
And, uh...
Yeah. Things got a little out of hand.
And for that...
I'm sorry, okay? We're both sorry.
Isn't that right, Samson?
That means he's sorry. [laughs]
Anyway, congratulations on making it this far, okay?
You really got something, kid.
So, good luck tonight.
May the best man, or kid, win.
[Frankie] Come on. Give him his space.
Come on. You gotta warm up, anyway.
Let's go.
Nice delivery, but I ain't buying it.
All right. Let's get focused.
So, I went to the thrift store the other day,
while you were at school.
It wasn't as nice as my vintage shop,
but I was able to pick out a few pieces,
and work my magic.
Huh? Huh? What do you think about this?
-Yeah! -Oh, yeah!
Aw! Yes!
Hey, kids.
-We should've gotten popcorn. -I know.
G'ma's here.
-Hi! -How's it going?
-What's up? -What's up?
What's up, homie?
-Kofi! -Yeah!
I didn't think you'd make it.
Come on, man. You know I'd never miss a cage match.
All right.
[announcer] Welcome your first opponent,
the Shredder from Sheboygan,
the mighty Samson!
[rock music playing]Â  Boo!
He's the best!
And here comes Samson.
Inspired dialogue, Graves.
I'm not worthy. I'm not worthy, Samson!
-Boo! -Come here. Samson, please!
-Let's go! My man! -Yeah!
[announcer] Your next opponent,
your very own hometown hero,
it's Kid Chaos!
â™ª I'mÂ always ready We're always ready â™ª
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.
You mean to tell me that this guy is taking on that guy?
What am I missing here? Am I missing something?
I know how it looks, but,
Kid Chaos has been crushing guys twice his size.
-For real? -Just wait.
-Really? -Mm-hmm
Okay. Let's see it.
[announcer] And finally, your very special guest referee,
WWE Superstar, Sheamus!
All right, Sheamus!
Come on, Red! Call it right, Red! Call it right!
Keep it fair.Â Keep it fair.
Keep it fair, all right?
Welcome to the main event!
Two men enter.
Only one will emerge a WWE NXT Superstar.
Bill.
Bill.
Terrifying bill.
-[Sheamus on TV] Are we ready? -Oh.
It's Sheamus.
-You got this, Kid Chaos! -Yeah!
Ring the bell!
[crowd] Boo!
Boo!
What is going on?
What the...
What?
-Leo? -Leo?
That nerd?
Leo!
What is this? Kid Chaos unmasked!
I told you someone was gonna die.
This isn't good.
Run, baby, run!
Okay, Samson. Put the mask on.
Come on, let's go. Pull it down.
Use your muscles! Suck in your cheek.
Suck in your ears!
Suck in your head!
Does anybody have any petroleum jelly?
-No, don't throw it down. It's... -[grunts]
Don't step on it!
What're you doing? Don't!
Listen, Samson. Let's... Let's work something out.
Maybe cut a deal.
-Ah! -For instance, youÂ know, um...
if you don't beat me up now,
maybe I'll teach you how to talk.
New plan. If you don't kill me,
I'll introduce you to some new people,
help you make a newÂ friend.
Because you need one. Bad.
That's not very nice, am I right?
Hey, Samson, leave him alone. He's just a kid.
He's trying to escape! He's trying to escape! Get him, Samson!
[Sheamus] Put him down!Â Put him down!
Put him down!
Stay up there, baby. Stay up there.
Hey! I said he's just a kid.
Back off, Samson. I'm the official here.
Kid, you all right?
Oh, no.
Samson, get up there! Get that mask!
Samson, he's going for the mask! Get the mask!
If he gets the mask before us, we're done!
Get the mask! You gotta get up there before him!
Get the mask, Samson!
Get up there and get the mask!
Go, climb!
Climb-- Oh, my back!
Get up there!
Leo!
Get down!
Leo, get down here! This is your dad!
Steve, where're you going?
To save my son!
No-- You're right. Security. It's fine. We're gonna--
Leo!
-Leo, you get down right now! -Hey!
Leo, get down! I'm his dad!Â I'm his dad!
Dad, what are you doing here?
What am I do-- Leo, what are you doing here?
That being said, I think you're gonna be okay.
I am?
Yes. Remember how I told you every superstar has a weakness?
Well, look at this guy!
He's sweating. Look at his hands! They're practically trembling!
Well, back at the tryouts,
he refusedÂ to jump off the top rope.
-That's because he hasâ€¦ -[both] A fear of heights!
[Frankie] Fear of heights? Are you guys crazy?
Fear of heights? This guy loves heights!
He talks about heights all the time. He...
He climbed Mount Everest last year, so...
Look down, Samson.
Or is my dad right?
-Are you scared? -[Frankie] Samson, keep climbing!
Keep climbing or I will send you back to that circus in Sheboygan!
If you really wanna beÂ the next NXT Superstar,
you know someday you'll have to get past this.
So, why don't you do it now? Right now?
Look down, Samson. I dare you.
I was right about something!
Sheamus!
Sheamus, get up!
-He did it! -He did it!
Did you see that? Oh, my God!
Get up! Hey! Count!
[all] One...
two... three! -Yeah! -[bell dings]
Oh, my God!
Yeah!
That's my son!
Yeah! Yeah!
[Steve] I told you that's my son!
Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God! You did it! -[laughing]
Yeah!
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
Dad...
I'm so sorry about all this.
And I'm sorry for what I said.
No, it's okay. You were right.
And I should have told you...
about Mom and everything. It's just...
It makes me sad, and so I was scared that you would be sad, too. But...
I have to be brave, just like you.
And neither of us needs a magical maskÂ to doÂ that.
There's one thing that you can always, always count on.
And that's I'm not going anywhere.
Ever.
I love you.
Love you, too.
You're still grounded.
You're beyond grounded.
â™ª TellÂ me when you're ready We're always ready â™ª
My son!
There they are...
Come on, guys. Come on!
Now, that was...
awesome!
One for the books, Kid Chaos!
Or should I call you Leo?
That's your realÂ name, right?
Also, you're 11?
Eleven and a half, technically, but yeah.
Leo, how did you do it?
Well, Miz,
at the end of the day,
I won because...
I had some really great people in myÂ corner.
That's great.
We've got a little problem.
We can't have an 11-year-old wrestling in WWE, can we?
That's correct.Â We cannot have an 11-year-old
wrestling in the WWE. It's not safe. He's not allowed to do it.
But I love you.
Probably not the best idea.
But I have a way we can fix this.
Since I won, how about I pick my replacement?
Do you have someone in mind?
Yes, I do.
Smooth Operator, get down here!
What?
[Leo] Come on, Smooth!
Come on!
He's wanted this ever since he was my age.
What do you guys think?
He's got what it takes.
Smooth Operator...
welcome to WWE!
Miz...
â™ª You won't regret this â™ª
Leo...
â™ª I'll never forget this â™ª
And WWE Universe,
I'll show you all,
â™ª No one can step toÂ â™ª
â™ª this! â™ª
-Yes! Oh, my God! -Big pipes.
That was amazing!
Leo, there's just one thing left to do.
I don't think so, you little brat!
Hold on. Hold on!
That check belongs to me.
You just got Grandma'd!
Hold on. Let me take a picture! -[clicks] -Ah!
[laughing] In your face!
[crowd chanting] Leo!Â Leo!Â Leo! [continues] Leo!Â Leo!Â Leo!
Yeah, let's go, Leo!
Yeah!
All right, boys, bring it in. Shake hands,
and give me aÂ good, clean match.
Let's see how well you do without the mask, Leo.
Yeah.
Let's see.
Well, let me get a quick selfie with the winner for the 'gram.
And I mean Instagram, not the other G word.
-Oh, yes! [laughing] -Nice.
[Kofi] Excuse me. Leo!
Hey, man.
That was a brave thing you did.
I had to come congratulate you myself.
Wow. Thanks, Kofi.
And you must be the proud father?
I am, you bet.
And who is this
beautiful creature?
Got nothing to say? I have never seen that before. [scoffs]
Oh. This is my--
Denise.
Well, the pleasure is mine, Denise.
Hey, man, I gotta be honest.
I didn't think you could pull it off.
But I'm so glad that you proved me wrong.
And it's too bad you can't join us in the WWE.
You were impressive.
What're you talking about? I'll see youÂ in ten years, Kofi.
And then, I'll show you the true meaningÂ of impressive.
Believe that.
You're on.
Denise.
[yelling] I love you!
I got three rib tip sandwiches with slaw. Them collards done?
Almost. They weren't cleaned good.
Throw on some hickory while you're out there. Damn, he's sweaty.
-Harold? -Yeah?
You unpack them beef ribs?
Yeah, they're done.
You sure? The last thing I need is them fools from the mosque
thinking I been sabotaging their movement with some pulled pork.
Where's Elijah?
[woman 2] And then I caught the nigga at Tops with another bitch.
He cheated on me, like, eight times. Why I still mess with him?
[woman 1] 'Cause you're stupid.
-[woman 2] I am. -[woman 1 chuckles]
[woman 2] But that D... -was savage though. -[woman 1] Mm-mm. Girl, no.
That's why your ass needs some drink.
[woman 2] Hey... Yeah, you right.
-[woman 1 chuckles] I'm kidding, girl. -[woman 2] You okay?
Excuse me. Where's your white wine? Uh, one aisle over.
What-- You looking for something specific?
A... A good one?
Don't laugh. I don't be knowing this. What? Okay, okay.
Um... [snaps] Here, follow me.
-[woman 1 chuckles] -Okay, uh...
Wait, so...
you like hip-hop? Yeah.
Okay. So...
First, we've got Chardonnay.
Now, Chardonnay is like the granddaddy of wine.
It's-- It's versatile, smooth and can kind of go with anything.
You know, it's like...
It's like the Jay-Z of wine.
-Okay. -Okay?
-[chuckles] -Okay, so next we've got the Pinot Grigio.
Uh, Pinot Grigio is a white wine, but with a little bit of spice to it.
It's like, "Oh, you thought I was just a white wine? I'm about to get stupid."
-[laughs] -It's-- It's like a Kanye West.
So Pinot Grigio's gonna say slavery was a choice?
It wasn't?
-[laughs] -And then, over here, uh... we've got the Rieslings.
Now, Rieslings are crisp, clean, usually kind of sweet.
So it's like the Drake of wine?
Yeah, Rieslings be in their feelings.
Okay.
That was good. I've got to give it up.
-You're about to give up something. -Bitch.
I'll take a bottle of the Drake.
Okay, uh... Well, uh, Thomas can ring you up.
Okay.
I fucks with Drake.
-Oh, shit! -["Pull Up" by Blac Youngsta playing]
You need a wake-up call?
-You need me to buy you a rooster? -I got my work schedules mixed up.
How you know my ribs are done? You just got here.
-Really? -What do you mean, "Really?"
If you cut them too soon, I lose money.
If I lose money, I can't take your mama to Vegas to see the Blue Man Group.
You want to be the one to tell her she can't go see those three fools?
I sure don't.
Dad, you've been teaching me since I was two. I know when it's done.
Y'all better not be back here arguing.
We've got the lunch rush, and I ran out of Sock It To Me cake.
A baby threw up in the bathroom,
and somebody's trying to pay with food stamps.
-I can't take no more drama. -Elijah's not cutting the meat right.
-I can't take no more drama. -Elijah's not cutting the meat right. -He don't want you to go to Vegas. -That's not true.
-He don't want you to go to Vegas. -That's not true. Better not be. These my ribs?
Yeah, they're your ribs.
[Sylvia] Okay, ladies. Sorry about the wait.
How are your grandmama's feet doing? They still swollen? You tell her I'm praying for her.
Ooh! Girl, I know them ain't lemons on your nails. -[woman] Yep. -Let me see.
-Ooh... -Going to the BeyoncÃ© concert tonight.
-Okay. -[woman] Okay...
-Yeah. -[Sylvia] Hey...
[laughs] Ooh, shit!
Mm. Girl! -Hey, Mama. [chuckles] -[laughs]
Hi, my babies!
Come on.
Sorry I'm late to pick up lunch for the kids, but I had to take them to get shots,
but I wasn't sure if I should do it 'cause of the whole autism thing.
But then I decided to do it,
and in the car, Kevin starts counting the McDonald's on the way here.
All the McDonald's. There are 15.
Look, Kevin is fine. All right?
Now, his head a little big, but ain't nothing you can do about that.
Come take the kids in the back.
Y'all want to learn how to chop up chicken?
-[kids together] Mm-hmm! -[Sylvia] Come on.
[Elijah] Hi.
How'd you grow up in a family restaurant but can't cook for shit?
How you got a beard that don't connect? Huh?
[sputtering] Stop it.
This is a new blazer.
-Stop! -[Louis] Elijah.
[Louis] When you gonna man that cash register?
Exactly, Elijah. Go man the cash register.
-Don't you! -[Louis] Elijah, pick that up.
[Brenda] Pick it up.
We ain't got to wait in line? Nah, baby, I told you. I'm family.
When they die, I'm getting all this. [chuckles]
Yo, what up, cuz? [grunts]
Yo, um... think you can hook me and boo up, so we ain't got to wait?
J.T., I told you. Ain't no more hookups.
Come on, Uncle Louis! Why are you doing me like that? You used to give me baths.
Don't trip.
Kill 'em. Kill 'em. Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em.
Kill 'em. Kill 'em. Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em.
-Kill 'em-- -This have an ending?
Elijah, make a run with me. Come on.
Aye, don't forget the rib tips. Hey, babe, you want some extra beans?
Yeah, you do. Ah...
[Louis] I'm good on charcoal.
-I need about two cords of hickory. -Okay.
I need some more of that cherry wood I got last week.
-I like the way them ribs turned out. -Very good.
Now, I've got some alder wood for sale that I think--
You must think I'm stupid. Can't nobody cook with that delicate shit.
You still grooming junior? -Hopefully one day it'll take. -[laughs]
[Louis] Tomorrow, I want you to come and meet our new meat distributor.
[Elijah] Uh... I can't.
-[stammers] Well, why not? -Um...
I've just, uh... got to prep some wine club shipments.
How come every time I try to teach you the business,
you've got an excuse why you can't do it?
Last month, I needed you to go with me to see about a new smoker.
You had some other wine thing.
You know how hard your grandfather worked
to keep this restaurant in the family.
-Yes, sir. -You know what this restaurant means -to the community. -Yes.
This place is historic. Frankie Beverly had a stroke there.
You're gonna take over the stand one day.
You need to know how to run it.
That's not it. I just can't do it tomorrow. Sorry.
Okay.
Next time, son... you're coming.
We've really had a great response.
Want to try some?
-Oh, no, I'm okay. -Too late.
So, as I was saying, the response to this wine has been out of this world.
We're very, very proud of it.
That's great. Thank you. [teacher] Absolutely.
What about that Chablis?
Oh. The 2017 is impeccable. â™ª Don't come around Tryin' to stand beside meÂ â™ª
-It needs the sweetness of a Riesling. -Hmm.
[Elijah] Best Chardonnay I've ever had.
-[man] Oh, come on. -Dead serious. And one of the instructors poured me something called Antica Terra.
-Oh, yeah. Oregon. It's good, right? -Insane.
And then Albert Bichot was there with this new 2016 Corton Grand Cru
that was like vanilla but also kind of fruity.
-[bottles clink] -Man, it was crazy.
-How was the swag bag? -Got a neck pillow.
-Swaggy. -Yeah, real swaggy.
But I was thinking, they specially curated all their wines for the fair.
I thought maybe we could do that for our wine club.
Like what if... Just hear me out.
What if we just sent out all different kinds of Barolos?
Is that crazy?
In Memphis?
-Yeah. -Come on. We always do the same thing.
We send a bunch of reds, a bunch of whites. Let's do something new. Something different, you know?
-[box thuds] -Ah, come on, man.
[clicks tongue] The wine fair was where you went to school, right?
-Yeah, it was good. -Hmm.
-[bottle clinks] -Classes, pretty hard or whatever?
Oh, yeah. And I had a kid while I was in school.
I'd go to Daddy and Me classes smelling like Merlot.
Full disclosure. I wasn't the only one.
So you thinking of applying or what?
[takes a deep breath] I don't know. Maybe. I don't think so.
Why not?
No wife, no kids. You've got time.
Yeah, well, my Pops wants me to take over the restaurant, so...
Yeah, I don't know. I just want to... find my own thing.
Just make sure you're sure. I took the test three times.
It was...
Yeah.
Okay.
Cool. All right. Um... [snaps]
I'm gonna figure out this wine club stuff.
-[Tanya] Hey. -Hey.
Hey. Hey. Oh, sorry. Y'all still open?
Yeah, yeah, we're still open. I'm just Googling some wine club stuff. You know, [imitating Rick Ross] every day I'm Googling.
You know, [imitating Rick Ross] every day I'm Googling.
Okay.
Yep. Uh... [stammers] Um.
Okay, you need help with something or something?
Yeah, I just maybe wanted to learn about what I bought the other day.
But, you know,Â this wine club stuff looks real good, though.
It is. Yeah, you know, it is. Uh...
Okay, so you get invited to our bi-monthly tastings
and you get a free subscription to Wine Enthusiast Magazine.
Oh, okay.
That's what's up. Uh, let's do that. [chuckles]
So you probably need my email, my...
address, my phone number?
Yes, I definitely need your number.
Okay, well, just in case it gets lost... Your magazine gets lost in the mail.
And there's this really great article this month about corks.
About corks?
-Cool. -It is cool.
-[laughs] -It is cool, because you think they're just corks, but they're...
not.
-Wow. -Wow. Okay, okay.
-Before you change your mind-- -Right.
-Just give me that. -Yeah, okay. [stammering] Mm-hmm.
[Sylvia] All right, we've got chicken, ham, macaroni and cheese,
and greens.
Nobody's gonna eat -any of my ambrosia salad? -Huh?
Maybe we just let it cool off.
It's Jell-O. It's already cold.
-Yeah. We know. -[family snickering]
-Stop it. -[Louis] Elijah, what happened to you
-Stop it. -[Louis] Elijah, what happened to you yesterday afternoon?
I thought you were supposed to pick up some more butcher paper.
Oh, um... sorry, I just, uh... [stammers] I had to do something.
Something more important than your job?
I went to a mixer about becoming a sommelier.
You trying to be an African?
-Is that like a pirate? -No, that's a Somalian.
-What did you say? -Sommelier.
Y'all know Kelly Kendrick dated a Somalian. He stole her identity.
That's horrible. Is she okay?
I don't know. I don't be up in people's business like that.
Then why bring it up? That don't make no sense.
-[all clamor] -You just told everybody that...
She was supposed to redo the front of my braid. She never said anything.
Hey, hey, hey. Everybody stop.
Okay? Elijah was saying something. Now go on. What's... What's the thing?
Uh, a sommelier is someone who's an expert in wine, like Raylan at my job.
He's a sommelier, but he buys wine.
At a restaurant, they help you decide which wine to drink.
So they're getting paid to tell people what to drink?
I could do that. Hennessy White goes with everything.
Nope. Anyway, uh, Raylan says he's gonna write me a letter of recommendation.
[Louis] I just hope, if Raylan puts himself out there like that, you follow through.
What does that mean?
I mean, you get an idea about something, but when it comes time to do it--
-Louis. -I'm just saying what everybody knows--
Louis!
But, hey, if you want to tell people what to drink with their chitlins,
[stammers] I'm fine with it.
-[Judy] Ain't that a group, Ambrosia? -[family chuckling]
[Louis] Baby, there's wig hair on the counter and in my sink.
Can we get rid of the wigs?
Uh-uh. They're too expensive. Baby, you've been in remission for two years.
You don't even need 'em.
I do.
Louis, my hair is still too thin,
and when I wear that blonde one, I look just like BeyoncÃ©, so no.
Yeah, you do look like BeyoncÃ©.
-What'd I do now? -You don't know?
-I don't. -You don't know?
Girl, I ain't doing this.
You embarrassed Elijah at the dinner tonight.
-Okay? [stammers] -[sighs] He was all excited about his little wine thing
and then you went and shit all on it.
Louis, you've got to support him in the stuff he wants to do.
I do support him.
I support him learning the business and not doing six million other things.
Well, that's what kids his age do. They're trying to figure out what they're good at.
At some point, he's gonna have to man up. [Louis] Five years ago, he was gonna be a DJ.
Then he was gonna teach English in Japan.
The boy don't even eat Panda Express.
That's Chinese.
-Don't. -I'm just saying.
We both know how this wine thing is gonna end up.
Louis, you ain't even stopped to ask the boy
why he wants to do the sommely thing.
I mean, you've got to give him a chance to figure it out.
What am I gonna do in the meantime? Just wait? I'm not getting any younger.
If he don't take over the stand, who's gonna carry it on when I'm gone?
-[sighs heavily] -My father started the thing... he gave it to me, and I'm supposed to--
[both] Give it to Elijah. I know.
That's right.
[Sylvia] I know you ain't trying to get nothing started
-after you talked about my wigs. -[exhales]
-[Louis] Baby-- -Back up.
[Sylvia] Uh-uh! You ain't getting that either!
-You good? -[laughing] Yeah.
-Yeah? -Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good, I'm good.
-Okay, okay. -It's been a while.
-Guess what? -What?
I bought a bottle of Chardonnay yesterday. -Uh-huh. -A French one.
Oh, hold up. Hold up, hold up.
Wait, so you went to another wine store already? You cheating on me already?
I mean...
So wine's, like, your thing?
Yeah, kind of.
Since when?
Mm... Like four or five years ago.
I was, uh... I was at this restaurant with my ex--
Oh, hold up. No, no, no. There was somebody before me?
Ooh. Was she ugly?
Why has she got to be ugly?
I don't know. You picked her. You're clearly upgrading.
-Okay, anyway... Um. [laughs] -[laughs]
Yeah, I was about to buy this cheap bottle of wine and the waiter was like, "Nah, try this."
this cheap bottle of wine and the waiter was like, "Nah, try this."
And so he goes on and on about this wine,
he's talking about stuff I never thought about before,
like, you know, how it's grown, where the grapes are from, all this stuff.
And so when I get home, I start researching everything I can about this wine I like.
Then it led to the next wine, and the next wine, and the next wine.
Yeah, I don't know.
Like, growing up...
we didn't have money to go nowhere, so...
when I get a wine from some place like France, some place like Spain,
I just feel like I'm kinda there.
You know what? You ain't right.
What?
To tell me a great story like that on the first date?
Now I got to go on another one. And another one.
Yeah, that's okay. -You sprung. It's alright. Could be worse. -Whatever.
-You sprung. It's alright. Could be worse. -Whatever.
So since you're so into wine, you ever want to do more than just work in the store?
Yeah, yeah, I'm, um...
[clicks tongue] thinking about... think about becomingÂ a sommelier.
But, um...
I don't know. The Master exam is pretty hard, so...
So? You're smart.
And the fact that I'm still here means you can keep up.
Okay. Yeah. [chuckles]
But in the whole, entire world, there's only, like, 230 Master Somms.
So why can't you be 231?
Uh... I don't know. It's just, between work and then studying for an exam,
I just think it'll be a lot.
If you work on passing the test as much as you do coming up with excuses,
it won't be hard. [chuckles]
I'm sorry.
That's not my place to say.
-[stammers] I don't know you like that. -It's alright.
It's all good. It's all good.
I mean...
there's always gonna be a reason we shouldn't do something, but...
if you want it...
This is the entrance exam to the Master Sommelier program.
There's theory and tasting
and you'll need to score an 80% to pass.
Good luck.
Begin.
-[indistinct chatter] -[Tanya on phone] So, how'd you do?
[Elijah] I'm still just waiting for the results.
-[phone rings] -But you think you passed though?
I don't know.
I hope so.
Well, I'm claiming we're gonna pass,
and if we don't, then we'll just do it again next year.
We? You trying to be a "we"?
[stammers] If you act right.
-[door closes] -My boss just got back. -Call me when you know. -Yeah.
'Kay.
That was just my granny.
She fell out the bed.
It's fucking ridiculous, right? What?
I've taken the exam twice. It's never taken this long to get the results.
How many times did you take it?
Oh, this is my first time.
Yeah, you'll probably fail. Don't feel bad. You a somm?
No, I work at Joe's Wines. You?
Waiter at Oak and Forage. Pay's good.
I used to date the hostess. She was pretty hot...Â ish.
Not that I'm hot or anything.
What do you think? On a scale of one to ten, what would you say I am?
Like a five or something?
Like, I feel like I have, like, a good neck or something.
[man] Hey. Gonna see if your name's here?
-[Elijah] Daddy? -[Louis] Yeah. I'm back here.
Whatcha think?
About what?
About this.
We opened up a second barbecue spot.
The loan came through a week ago. Previous owner lost it due to tax issues.
It's the same day, every April 15th.
But I'm thinking a lot of things that Papa did...
were kind of...
old.
But I thought that-- that this place can be...
how we do it.
The neighborhood is gentrifying. You know, the white folks.
And, uh, I was thinking
I'd do a bar where you can do your... your wine thing, you know.
[stammers] You know more about that than I do.
Yeah. Huh.
Wow.
Yeah, this is real nice of you, Daddy, but, um...
[chuckles] Uh, I don't know. This is a lot.
Yeah. Well, run the other place. It pretty much runs itself, you know.
What?
Okay, I don't, um...
I don't want to take over the...
I don't want to take over the restaurant.
Uh, [stammers] I've been meaning to tell you, but, um...
I'm going back to school.
[stammering] You remember when I said I was interested in becoming a sommelier?
The African wine thing?
Again, it has nothing to do with Africa. Um... But, yeah, no, [stammers] I took the entrance exam.
Um... But, yeah, no, [stammers] I took the entrance exam.
I got in and...
[takes a deep breath] well, uh, I start in a few days.
I mean, tuition's gonna wipe out all my savings, [stammering] but I'm excited, you know? [steadily inhales and exhales]
So-- So what do you think?
I think you're a grown man. You don't want to run a restaurant, don't run the restaurant.
I won't let school get in the way of work.
Okay. [stammers] I'm gonna close up.
[teacher 1] The Master exam is the hardest exam you will ever take in your life.
You will be tested on your theory.
You will be tested on your service.
And you will also be tested on your blind tasting.
The blind tasting is the most important part of anything you will do.
-[hip-hop music plays faintly] -And this is the grid.
This is what you will need to know
to identify each and every single wine properly.
You will be tested on the sight and the clarity of the wine.
You will be tested on the fruit and the non-fruit components.
Acid, structure, balance. I need to know whether or not
balance. I need to know whether or not this wine is an Old World wine or a New World wine.
[teacher] I need to know the grape variety, and most importantly, the region.
[teacher 2] Of the five sub-regions, there's Chablis,
CÃ´te de Nuits, CÃ´te de Beaune, CÃ´te Chalonnaise and MÃ¢connais.
And within these sub-regions, there are 500 premier cru vineyards.
Make sure about wines. About wine serving.
[groans] All right.
You studying?
Yep. [sighs]
What are you doing?
You almost done?
No.
-No? -No.
-[exhales] -Are you sure?
-[voice shaking] No. -[laughs]
[Newton] What's your size?
Come here. This one might work.
[Newton] What do you think? Like it?
[teacher 3] Then cut the foil at the bottom of the lip,
then repeat the same on the back side.
Then one last cut up.
Now you can remove the foil.
-[Elijah] All right, here it is. -Good looking on this.
Of course. Okay, if you're cooking red meat, I'd go with the Pinot Noir.
You cooking white, I say the Albert Bichot La Moutonne.
Moutonne.
Oh, that sounds bold as hell.
Yeah, I'm about to be Moutonne. [rhythmic] You know this nigga down.
They don't even know. [laughs] And you know it's fancy,
They don't even know. [laughs] And you know it's fancy, -because it's in cursive. -[chuckles] Yep.
-I appreciate you. -Sure.
Oh, Chablis. Yeah, that's cool.
[Richie] How are you at the German varietals?
I'm okay.
These names are insane.
MÃ¼ller-Thurgau, SpÃ¤tburgunder, Weissburgunder?
Hold up.
Y'all using my favorite mug as a spit cup?
Oh, uh, [stammers] I told him this was your favorite mug
and Elijah was like, "Use this, Richie." And I was like, "Are you sure?
and Elijah was like, "Use this, Richie." And I was like, "Are you sure? This looks like Tanya's special mug." I mean, look at it.
This looks like Tanya's special mug." I mean, look at it. I just had a feeling about it. [tentatively] Have a good time in there.
I just had a feeling about it. [tentatively] Have a good time in there.
I'm sorry, that usually works for me. Throwing my friends under the bus.
Acidity, medium.
[clicks tongue] Actually, medium minus.
[sniffs] Tasting some new oak, spice notes, toasted vanilla.
Medium tannin. This wine is dry.
This wine is from a warm climate. New World. Possibly...
Argentina. Malbec.
This is from the Uco Valley.
It's a 2006 Alta Vista Single Vineyard Temis.
[instructor] It is.
Is that five in a row? [chuckles] I think that's five in a row.
I hate this guy.
Who gives a shit? He's just showing off.
You guys want in?
-No, man, you got it. -[Harvard] Yeah.
I do got it.
[instructor] All right.
One wine, one guess.
-Begin. -Color, the wine is yellow.
This wine is yellow-gold. A very pale concentration.
[sniffs] Some floral notes.
-Lemon. -[clicks tongue] Hints of new oak. This wine is dry. Medium minus acidity.
-Acidity, medium plus. -Alcohol, medium.
Complexity is medium. This wine is from a cool climate.
-This is Old World, from France. -This is a Chardonnay from Burgundy.
-...from Burgundy. -From Chablis.
-From CÃ´te de Beaune. -It's a Simmonet-Febvre Chablis.
This wine is Olivier Leflaive Les SÃ©tilles Chardonnay.
Final answers?
It's Simmonet-Febvre.
-Fuck him. -I don't care about beating him.
I'm pissed I didn't know the wine. We've been studying every night, right?
-It's only been a month. -No, that's not the point.
I mean, those wines weren't that hard. It's not gonna get any easier.
Yeah, that's true.
Hey, you want a coffee? [stammers] Let me get you a coffee.
Cool. Thanks.
I need money.
For what? You just said you were gonna get me a coffee.
Yeah, "get." I'll get it for you when you give me the money.
Hey, I'm doing you a favor, okay? I don't need the sighs.
It's rude. I'm just saying it's rude.
A ten?
How am I supposed to get myself a croissant with this?
I'll make it work.
[Harvard] Olivier Leflaive.
Are you still upset?
I'm Eric, but they call me Harvard. I went to Harvard.
Look, aÂ friend and I are starting a study group. Thought we could team up.
Uh... Yeah, I don't have time to fuck around.
You-- You think I'm fucking around?
I don't know what you're doing, but if it's like that bullshit you--
It pushed you though, right?
Look, it's impossible to pass the Master exam without a study group, so...
might as well push each other.
You got that barbecue spaghetti ready?
Cheryl been sent that out.
Damn, it's hot.
Is this what menopause feels like?
-[faucet runs] -I don't know. I'm 40.
-What? -What?
It's just you're all up on me.
Breathing.
[chuckles, clears throat] Yeah, no, I was just gonna... I was gonna ask if I could swap shifts.
Yeah, so, um, I joined a study group with some of the guys from class and...
Wednesday is the only time they have off, so...
Why I gotta move my whole life around to accommodate you?
Whole life? I'm just asking to swap shifts.
Well, Wednesday is our busiest day.
-We gotta start the wood, -[order bell dings] brine the chicken, start prepping the big orders.
Hey, look, I'll swap with Elijah.
No, you can't. We're going to CC's.
It's all-you-can-eat crab. That's Dungeness and soft shell.
I thought you said you weren't gonna let this wine thing mess with your work.
-[Louis] That's what you said, right? -Yeah.
[Louis] You said that, right?
Okay.
I'll figure it out.
All right.
-[sighs] -Oh, so now you done got all funky?
Well, you ain't got to go tonight.
My ticket's paid for.
Look at you.
Miss Thing is doing way too much.
I don't see what the big deal is.
That's because you dated Carol in high school. She was a slut then and she's a slut now.
Look how she's dressed. Breasts hanging all out.
Your breasts is hanging out.
No, they're not!
My breasts are accentuated.
Yes, they are.
-[laughs] What am I gonna do with you? -You're gonna love me, baby.
-You're gonna love me. -[Sylvia giggles]
-[phone buzzes] -Hey. Hold up.
What? The alarm went off at the restaurant.
Shit.
Will you stop driving like a crazy person? I just want to know what's going on.
[sighs] Lord.
-[engine stops] -[car door closes]
-[Sylvia] Elijah? -[Louis] What's going on here?
We got an alert that the alarm went off.
-Oh, my fault. Um... -[music stops] She accidentally opened the door before I, uh, put in the code.
She who? Who's she?
Oh, this is Tanya. Tanya, this is my folks. Hi.
Tanya's my, um...
Oh, if I'm cleaning with you at midnight, I'd better be your girlfriend.
I know that's right.
You said I had to finish up all this stuff before I went to study group,
so I just decided to come back and knock it out tonight.
[softly] He's right. You did say the reason he couldn't switch shifts was that he had to work. And so now he done finished the work.
was that he had to work. And so now he done finished the work. -You said that. -[softly] I know. I know--
-You said that. -[softly] I know. I know-- I'm just trying to help you remember what you said.
[Louis] I know what I said.
I don't need you to help me remember.
Why don't you remember to DVR Power?
-Really? -Remember that?
[stammering] So you... You, uh-- You finished everything?
Uh, I'm about to.
So...
I can go to study group?
I mean, your work's done here, so...
All right.
I'm, uh... I'm gonna go finish the chickens.
I like your hat.
So are you funky now?
-[car rushes past] -I'm not feeling you right now.
Yeah, you are.
You're feeling me. Come on.
Color, uh, red. Almost deep garnet.
Slightly hazy, tiny bits of sediment. [takes a breath]
Smells of, uh, dried black cherry, currents...
No, no, no. Figs. [stammers] It's figs, right?
You know we can't tell you, man.
Hints of, uh, sweet and savory tones,
-[taster snapping] -like sage, bay leaf, cinnamon, vanilla?
-[inhales] Uh, acidity, medium. -[paper splats]
[Richie] This is a Cab.
[sighs] New World, high-quality producer.
He's getting tight. [Richie] Fuck you.
Possibly from Australia.
[stammering] I'm calling it. Leeuwin Estate Art Series Cab.
-[taster] What year? -Ticktock, ticktock.
-2007? -[group dissents]
[slams table] Fucking fuck!
-It was a Cab, but it's a three from Napa. -[cards splat]
You need a towel. Your whole face is sweaty.
You guys switched the wines?
Why would we switch the wines?
-'Cause you're dicks. -That's fair.
[Harvard] Oh, shit.
[Elijah] What?
Our class is doing an exchange program -with our sister school in Paris. -[Richie] What?
We've got to pay for it though. That's bad for me. That's bad for me.
Dude, who gives a shit? It's Paris.
What?
No, I just-- I probably can't go.
What? You have to go.
[stammers] It'll be like The Three Amigos only having two amigos.
[stammers] Although three of us will be going, so we will actually be The Three Amigos.
Yeah.
Let's get some fresh air.
We did switch the wines. Fuck...
you.
So... you really can't go?
I mean, I emptied out my savings for the tuition, and...
what, this trip's, like, an extra ten grand?
-[sighs] -I mean, can't you ask your parents or...?
[chuckles] No, they ain't got money like that, man.
I mean...
me even being in school right now is a whole thing for my pop, so...
Yeah, man, [stammers] I get that.
My dad is...
He's not cool I'm in school either.
But at the end of the day...
[chuckles] I gotta do what I got to do. Hey, I hear you, but...
you know...
What if, uh...
[clicks tongue] What if you and I went half on everything?
Could you do it then?
So everybody in your class is going? Yep.
-Harvard said he would split it with you? -Yeah.
-And Raylan said he's fine with it? -Yes.
-So why can't you go? -'Cause I don't have the money.
-But Paris is, like, it for wine, right? -Yeah.
Then, baby, you gotta go. This is a real step towards what you--
I know it's a real step. You don't think I know it's a real step?
-I do. -Then why are you acting like I don't?
-I'm not trying to fight with you. -Are you sure?
Yeah.
I just, I don't get why you're not doing everything you can to go.
It's not like you're doing everything you need to be doing, so.
-What? -You're telling me what I need to do,
but you aren't a nurse.
Why don't you go back to school -instead of just being a receptionist? -Fuck you.
-instead of just being a receptionist? -Fuck you. -When it's all so easy-- -Fuck you.
-When it's all so easy-- -Fuck you. Okay.
Want me to set the alarm?
Okay.
So you're not gonna talk to me now?
[clicks tongue] I mean, it's whatever.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I just don't wanna fuck it all up.
Why would you fuck it up?
I'm just so close.
What if I get there and I'm no good? Then what?
It's not like I've got the money anyway, so, whatever.
[sighs] Your family can't help you? No. [scoffs] They ain't got the money either.
I know.
Maybe they can help you get it.
Anyone else?
-[dishes clank] -[J.T.] Give me some of that. It's a good bottle, E.
[sighs] What's it mean, "Grand Cru"?
Yeah, that pretty much means it's the best.
Yeah. It's actually not that hard to read a label. It's divided into five parts.
The producer's name.
The region it's from. The varietal. Like whether it's a Cab or Merlot.
-Hmm! -[Elijah] The vintage, or the year the grapes are pulled.
And then you got the alcohol level, which--
Can I have more green beans?
Why?
Um... Let me see that.
See, I didn't know that, you know, every little thing on here had its own meaning.
-That's something. -[Tanya] You know, I don't know how
-That's something. -[Tanya] You know, I don't know how Elijah memorizes all this stuff. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning,
Elijah memorizes all this stuff. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, he's still studying.
So you be spending the night over there?
Oh, no, no, just...
Ooh... Y'all just over there sinning.
Yeah, [snaps] um...
You know what? It actually kind of helps when I think of wine like barbecue.
You know, uh, certain places just do certain things good.
Like Memphis and ribs or, uh, Texas and brisket.
It's kind of like Argentina and Malbec or Provence and rosÃ©.
What region would Dad's barbecue be from?
-Courvoisier. -[family laughs]
-[Judy] You are so stupid. -[J.T.] My bad.
I'm just glad you've found something you like.
Oh, I'm just trying to stay focused. It's harder than you thought, huh?
[clicks tongue] You know... You know what? At times, yeah.
It always is.
I guess I'll get better at it once I go to Paris.
What?
-[overlapping indistinct chatter] -Yeah, no, um...
Uh, yeah, [laughs] uh, my class got asked to go to Paris and study wine.
When do you leave?
Well, I don't-- I don't actually have the money.
Not yet. But I'm gonna have at least half when I sell my car.
Wait, wait, wait. -You gotta sell your car? -[J.T.] Come on, man,
you can't sell the Nissan. We got so many blow...
Tires. Just flat...
-tires is all. All over the place. -[Judy] Hush.
[Sylvia] Listen. Money, ain't never been the reason nobody in this family did nothing.
Okay? So if you're gonna sell your car to come up with half,
then we're gonna get together and come up with the other half.
-To my baby going to Paris! -[family cheering]
-[family laughing and clamoring] -[glasses clink]
I'm gonna need you to trim these a little more.
The last few ribs had too much fat.
-How much do you want me to cut? -Eh, just--
-[keyboard clacking] -[text whooshes] [Louis] Uh...
At least a... a quarter of an inch.
-[stammers] That's fine. -Okay.
Okay, can I have everybody's attention, please?
[shushes] Okay, shoo, shoo, shoo. Okay, come on,
[shushes] Okay, shoo, shoo, shoo. Okay, come on, everybody be quiet, alright?
Hush it up. -[music stops] -Don't mess up my moment.
Uh, Elijah, come on up here.
Okay, look at my baby. -Don't he look good? -[crowd] Yeah!
Do you know how much your family loves you, boy? Do you?
-I do. -Do you?
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Okay, well, they love you so much that...
they raised $3,820.45.
Really, J.T?
What? Why everybody looking at me?
Forty-five cents?
-[crowd laughs] -When's my party?
All a parent wants...
is for their child to be happy.
[voice breaking] And when I had cancer, I didn't...
[woman] Take your time.
[clicks tongue]Â To sit here today in front of all y'all...
[tearfully] and watch my baby go to Paris...
You're going to Paris.
[loudly] To be a sommelier!
Ooh! God is good, 'cause that's the first time I got that word right!
-[crowd laughs] -Huh? Won't he do it?
I'm not gonna take up all the time,
because I know Elijah's daddy wants to say something. Baby?
[stammers] I think you said it all, baby.
Okay, well, um... the food is ready,
and we've got some fancy French desserts, too.
[Elijah] Hey.
-Hey. -Uh...
Are you working?
Yeah, I'm just...
-trying to get this thing together here. -Uh-huh.
[stammering] So I'm about to head out, but, uh...
I got--Â I got you and Mama a thank you gift.
Yeah, it's a... it's aÂ Barolo from Italy.
Uh, a father and son started it together. -[spray hisses] -Well you know I don't drink wine.
Yep.
Yep, yep. Um...
Yeah.
Just figured it was a...
cool connection.
I'm sure your Mom'll drink it.
-[metal clanks] -[hushed] Damn.
That's what our last words are gonna be before I leave?
Last words? [chuckles]
-Last words. -See, why you got to do that?
You're the one that said, "Last words," like you were going off to war.
You're gonna be in Paris drinking wine and eating croissants and shit.
Yeah, you know, ever since I started school, you've been giving me a hard time.
'Cause you think you're better than us.
-[scoffs] -That ain't true?
Every time I try to teach you the business, you'd rather waste time doing five million other things.
None of which led to a damn thing.
Yeah, 'cause I didn't wanna get stuck in the barbecue--
Stuck? That's what you think?
That's what I think. I think you got stuck.
You ain't gotta set another damn foot in there again.
Yeah, whatever.
Yeah, whatever.
[Elijah] Damn, this courtyard is French as fuck.
[Harvard chuckles] It sure is.
We're on the fourth floor.
[Elijah] Shit. I got a view?
[Harvard] It'd better or I'm gonna get my money back.
All right, you hooked it up. Yeah, I did. [laughs]
I'm gonna go check out the rest. Really hope my room has a candelabra.
[woman 1] Girl, where'd you get your nails done?
[woman 2] Girl, my place is bomb. They serve you champagne while you wait.
-[woman 1] Oh, they get you lit, too? -Uh-huh.
[woman 1] Oh, I'm there. Where it at?
[doctor] Mrs. Bruener, sorry to keep you waiting. How ya doing?
-[Sylvia stammers]Â Nervous. -[doctor] Understandable.
We got the results of your biopsy.
Unfortunately, your cancer has come back.
It's metastasized to your lungs.
Now, it's obviously not good...
but we do have a plan.
Hey, baby, how are you feeling?
Want a blanket or some... some water?
Could we have some water and some of them cookies y'all make?
Louis, I don't want no cookies.
I know. They're for me.
The doctor says he's coming by with the test results today, right?
-Yes, baby. -Okay.
[gasps] Ooh, look, wait. Elijah sent some pictures.
Oh, this is him standing next to some French building.
Him next to another...
building, yeah.
Okay, well, basically it's him standing next to a whole bunch of buildings, but they're French buildings.
He looks so happy.
[Louis] You see that shit?
They got the white people their cookies first.
What's the point of having a PPO if you can't get free cookies?
So... every time I bring up Elijah, you're just not gonna talk about it?
Okay. Talk about it all you want.
I don't want him to know about none of this right now. There ain't nothing he can do for me from over there.
Okay.
[clicks tongue] Ooh, he got that little French hat. I wanted that!
-[Louis sighs] -It would look so cute on me.
Here we are.
Albert Bichot.
-Are you sure it's not? -Yep.
You for real thought this was a Domaine de Bonserine CÃ´te-RÃ´tie?
Yeah, it tasted like one.
-No, it didn't. -Shut up.
CÃ´te-RÃ´tie wines are from the Rhone Valley.
They have crazy tannic undertones. This has almost no tannin.
Okay, so you're the master of tannin now?
Huh? Does this have tannin? Tell him this has tannin.
-There's no tannin. -Show me on the map.
-All right. -Thank you, genius.
-Yes. -Hey.
-[Leann speaking indistinctly] -Can we talk real quick?
All right. We're gonna take a little boat ride.
We're gonna get on a little canoe. Put your sweaters on.
-Mm. -And then we're gonna exit in the Valley of No Tannin.
[sighs] Okay.
Hey, you know what? Sometimes, just fucking agree with me. Okay?
I need this.
Aw... I didn't know that.
Why are you being mean to me? -Okay. -I'm not.
You know what? I needed a friend, -and you're just being rude. -Thank you.
-and you're just being rude. -Thank you.
I'll go sit somewhere else.
That's fine. I'll sit here.
-See ya. -Bye.
It's fine. I can be alone.
Okay.
Uh, do you... Uh, sir, excuse me, do you guys need a fourth?
[stammers] Is that a yes?
-No, no. -No, no?
-No, no. -No, no? It's fine.
â™ª I'm gonna be alone foreverÂ â™ª
So what's up?
My dad got me a job...
uh, working at Citibank with him.
Back in Nashville.
So...
what about school?
Damn. I'm sorry, man.
[clicks tongue] I... I've got to leave the day after tomorrow. What?
We're supposed to be splitting expenses.
[stammers] I know.
That's the only way I could come on this trip.
I can't afford to be here another month and pay my bills at home. I'm tapped out.
I didn't have a choice, man. I, um...
-I told you my dad can be... -[scoffs]
I'm sorry.
[stammering] Des... What? S-Sorry.
[Louis] Hello?
H-Hello?
Elijah? Dad?
Sorry, I thought this was Mom's phone.
What did you want your mama for?
Nothing. I'm just checking in.
So how's everything going at the restaurant?
You know, black people are still eating pork.
How's the new spot? Are you gonna build a new bar?
Maybe. You know, things change. You know. You know...
Okay, you know, I'll just call Mom back.
Yeah, okay. Yeah.
[Elijah] All right.
Hey, baby, how are you feeling?
I'm alright. You know.
Poking and prodding.
Who was that on the phone?
Elijah.
Really? [stammers] How's he doing? How's Paris?
Fine, but he wouldn't say.
Well, what did he want then? Money, but he wouldn't ask.
Oh, well, we've gotta give him some.
How's he supposed to make money in France? Being a mime?
People hate mimes. But a black mime? Ain't nobody trying to pay for that.
-We ain't giving him no money. -Yes, we are.
No, we're not.
Hey, baby.
-Hey, y'all. -[Louis] I'm gonna get you some water.
Hey, Mama. I brought you some books and magazines.
[Brenda on phone] Eli, it's me.
You...
You talk to Mama?
I'm coming home.
[Sylvia] Oh, no, you're not.
Boy, you got a non-refundable plane ticket,
and we ain't got no more money.
I just need to see you.
To see me to do what? Watch me sit around?
You're in Paris. Do Paris shit.
[out of breath] I saw them pictures you sent though. Those looked nice. How's the food out there? You had snails yet?
[scoffs] No.
School? Is school good?
School's good.
Uh, my name is Elijah. I'll be your sommelier this evening.
Um, I heard it's a special occasion.
It's our anniversary.
Congratulations.
-Thank you. -In that case,
may I recommend the 2010 Estate Chardonnay from Staglin Vineyards in Napa.
Napa wine? But we are in France.
[chuckles] Right.
You are right. I'm so sorry.
Uh, in that case, may I recommend a very good French Chardonnay,
the, uh, 2007 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru?
First, you suggest a Californian Chardonnay.
Now it's a French one. You can't make up your mind?
-No, I absolutely can. I-- -In a minute, he's going to suggest one
-No, I absolutely can. I-- -In a minute, he's going to suggest one from Spain and they don't even make Chardonnay.
-[man laughs] -Uh... [stammers] Uh, I'm so sorry. You know what, as a matter of fact,
You know what, as a matter of fact, I'll just remove your red wine glasses and I'll--
I'm so sorry. Um...
I'm so...
-Let me just clear that up. -[man clears throat]
Excuse me. Sorry about that.
[man] Cut.
I'm glad everyone saw this.
When you're a sommelier and you're working,
something like this will happen.
Unhappy customers, getting flustered.
That's why we practice it.
Now, what could Elijah have done differently?
Yes?
Hey.
[Tanya] Hey, baby.
How are you doing?
-[R&B playing] -I'm out pre-gaming with my girls. -This bitch, Ava, got engaged! -[women laugh]
Wait, sorry, who? Who got engaged?
I know, right?
It's in the bag.
Why are you up? It's the middle of the night there.
-I don't know. I'm just feeling kind of... -[Ava] I'm getting married!
[Tanya] I'm sorry, baby. What's going on?
No, hey, you... you... you're having fun with your girls. You go have fun.
-It's all good. -No!
No, no. Call me back tomorrow.
Okay. I'll call you tomorrow.
Hey, um...
do you mind spotting me? I didn't get paid yet.
-Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah. -You sure? Okay.
-[car honks] -Sorry.
Four eighty-six. I don't know if that's big enough.
-Hello? -[man] Hi, Mr. Bruener.
-Hello? -[man] Hi, Mr. Bruener. I'm Jimmy from Wells Fargo. How's your day?
It's fine, thank you.
Great. I'm happy to hear that. And the weather in Memphis? It's good?
It's okay, it's all right.
Great. Great. At Wells Fargo, we always want to make sure our customers are--
Jimmy, I got shit to do. Can we speed this up?
Copy that. I'm-- I'm calling because I wanted to verify
that you authorized a transfer of $1,500.
Fifteen hundred dollars? [stammers] I didn't do that.
Where is it-- Where is it transferred to?
Give me one second to pull that up.
It was a bank account in Paris.
You gave Elijah $1,500?
He needed it.
He asked for it.
Actually, he told me not to send it.
And I sent it anyway. [coughs] I'm just...
I'm tired of you two fussing and fighting back and forth.
What y'all gonna do if I'm not here?
You can't do that. You can't use cancer to win a fight.
Yeah, I can.
Me and my father ain't done all this work for Elijah to--
-You and Elijah ain't you and your daddy. -I know.
When my daddy had that stroke, I did all I could to keep -that restaurant going. I didn't leave. -I know.
-that restaurant going. I didn't leave. -I know.
There's value in that.
There is.
Everything I learned from my father happened there.
Everything I taught Elijah happened there.
And then that boy -wanna come and throw everything away-- -He ain't throwing you away, Louis.
-wanna come and throw everything away-- -He ain't throwing you away, Louis.
He just wants something different, and you've gotta make peace with that.
Mrs. Bruener, you want to try and eat something?
Come sit by me.
You eat today? Yeah, I had a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
You want what's on my tray?
-I wouldn't touch that if you made me. -[giggles]
Want me to cook for you?
Want me to get you some ribs?
I wish I could.
You can't handle ribs now. -Yeah, ribs. -[inhales and exhales deeply]
I'm gonna make me some ribs.
-Okay... [flips page] -[R&B plays faintly on radio]

Okay.
-Hey. -[J.T.] Hey, man.
Uh... Can we talk? Not really, man. I'm studying.
It's about your mom.
-[floorboards creaking] -Okay...
All set?
Uh, I think I'm still waiting on a sweet potato pie.
Aunt Judy's almost done with the ham. I tried to make Mom's monkey bread. I hope it tastes right.
I tried to make Mom's monkey bread. I hope it tastes right. It probably doesn't taste right. I think I let the dough rise too long.
It probably doesn't taste right. I think I let the dough rise too long.
Yeast. [laughs nervously]
I'm sure it's fine.
I just wanted to make some stuff Mom would want.
I know.
[sniffles] I'm gonna check on the ham.
-[indistinct chatter continues] -Take care.
Hey.
How are you doing?
You want something to eat or something?
-[Tanya sighs] Hey, baby. -Hey.
I set out all the extra chairs, and I made your granny a plate.
Thanks.
You need anything?
No, I'm good. Uh...
Just...
Okay. [stammers] I'm gonna head up.
Yeah. Okay.
[on phone] Hey, Dad. It's Eli. Um...
I was just checking to see if you needed anything at the restaurant.
Yeah.
Just let me know.
[preacher] Psalm 34, verses 18 through 22 says...
[man] Yes, Lord.
[preacher] ...that the Lord is close to the brokenhearted.
[man] Everlasting.
He rescues those -whose spirits are crushed. -[all] Yes.
[preacher] Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers.
-You're fucking crazy. -You don't know what you're talking about.
[Richie] Fuck you, I don't. There's no way Chili's is better than Applebee's.
They have an eight-layer cheese dip that--
[stammers] You know what? I'm not doing this with you today. You ready?
[clicks tongue] Yep.
-You're still wrong. -You're still wrong.
All right, color. This wine is red.
This is red wine. Um...
Almost like deep red roses. Like, uh...
Like a crimson.
Okay.
I'm getting notes of, uh...
Whoa, this is a bold wine. Uh... [chuckles]
Let's see.
[clicks tongue] Bell pepper...
olive,
even smoked meat.
You all right?
Yeah, man, [chuckles] uh, I'm just a little tired. [laughs]
Yeah.
Okay. Well...
Acidity...
Um... medium minus.
Let's see, um...
[Elijah slurps] Texture, creamy.
Um, the finish is surprisingly sweet.
Sorry. [chuckles, sniffles]
Um, this is, um...
[voice breaking] This is, uh, from...
[sniffles] This is from a warm climate.
[voice shaking] Got a lot of years on it. This wine is old.
This wine is old.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
[knocks] Hey. [Louis] Hey.
What are you doing here? I was just on my way home.
Hey. How's it going?
How are you doing?
Eh, good.
I see you kept the bar.
Yeah. Contractor already had the space for it.
Said it'd be more trouble to get rid of it.
Pop would trip out seeing this.
Yeah. Building the first one, he...
definitely didn't think we'd have two.
I don't see how he kept one going. Well, you kept it going, too.
I did what I had to do.
You ever regret it?
Regret what?
You know, leaving... leaving college, taking over the stand.
Not really. I mean...
Sometimes I wonder what it would've been like to have been a teacher.
Uh... I'm sorry. That's what you went to college for?
[stammers] You were studying to be a teacher?
Yes. And?
I just didn't know that's why you were going to school, that's all.
I don't see what's so damn funny. I wanted to help little black kids read. It's beautiful.
I wanted to help little black kids read. It's beautiful.
Yes. Black kids should read. Of course.
Helping Pop was just more important than what I wanted.
I watched him build that restaurant from nothing. I watched him...
It's just...
Let me have that screwdriver.
-Flathead? -Yeah.
You hungry or something?
No, I'm good.
-Okay. -[opens sealed can]
Can I, um...
You need me to go on a run or anything?
No, I'm okay.
-I'm good. -Mm.
Okay.
What are you doing here?
Uh... I didn't know if you were still coming in -or who was gonna start the wood. -[wood crackling]
I mean, I've still got to work.
Yeah, but I know how much you have going on with here and the new joint, so...
figured you might want to go home and sleep or something.
I'm just trying to help.
[stammers] I can take off.
You gonna come all early, you might as well just go on and finish the fire.
You sure?
Am I sure I don't wanna bend over with my bad back
and lift the heavy log into the hot-ass fire?
I'm pretty damn sure.
You try your sister's monkey bread?
Yeah, it wasn't half bad.
No. It wasn't.
She'd better not make it again, but it wasn't bad.
Were all the, uh, dishes in there?
Uh, yeah, and as soon as I unload these, I'll go season the smokers.
All right, I'll be back. I gotta go see our meat guy.
You... You want me to go with you?
Why?
Oh, well, you know, you asked me to go with you last time, but...
You ain't got class?
Nah, yeah, nah. It's not a big deal. I can make it up.
All right. Come on.
[J.T.] You said it was all good.
Nick, you stay flaky.
Yeah, and don't think I don't know you took my protein bars either.
Whatever.
He ain't got the hookup.
It's all good. I'll figure out my own car situation.
-[beat plays] -How you holding up? Good. Yeah.
-School's good? -[Elijah] School's great. Um...
I actually think I might have to take some time off though.
-Yeah? -Yeah, I don't want to, but, you know...
My pops is running both the restaurants without Mom, so I just think...
it's kind of a lot.
And you know my dad. He's...
not the type to say anything, but...
Yeah, he definitely won't.
You know, the last couple of weeks, I had to wake up early to start the wood,
missed a bunch of classes just to help him run errands, you know?
I mean, I wake up at 4 a.m.
-Yeah, that sounds like a lot. -It is a lot.
And low key... not a lot of black folks in that school.
White people are kind of funny.
Man, white people be tripping.
I was down in Germantown at the Whole Foods,
and this white woman was looking at me like, "What are you doing here?"
And I'm like, "Damn, a nigga can't get no prosciutto in peace?"
-[Elijah chuckles] -Yeah, man. You don't need that drama right now.
I'd probably take a break too.
[sighs] Exactly.
Uh, all right, man. Let's see what you got.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
I'm about to hit you with this heat.
Really, my nigga? The coaster's right there.
Man, this is teak furniture.
Teak.
I think he be stealing.
[administrator] Are you sure?
Yeah. It's just not a good time.
Look...
everyone who's studied for the Master exam has struggled, and...
I can't imagine what it feels like to lose a parent in the middle of all that, but...
if you withdraw...
you'll have to start all over.
Yeah. I know.
Hey. Hey.
-You dropped out of school? -Yeah.
Forget the fact that I even had to hear about it from Richie, instead of my man.
But like for real?
Well, it's not really a good time right now.
So what about the Master test? You can't just cram for it.
I'll take it next year.
Next year?
After all the work and money you put in? No, that's a waste.
I don't think helping my dad right now is a waste.
That's not what I'm saying.
You know that's not what I'm saying.
I know school was getting tough before your mom passed, but...
what? That's just it?
Uh... I mean, it is what it is. I gotta go back to work.
Elijah, come on!
Elijah!
He's definitely a top-five point guard. Yeah, but Conley plays in a small market.
If he wanna be more popular, he gotta cut that hair.
What's that got to do with anything?
The white folks in Memphis ain't seeing all that.
The boy looks like he steals cars in Wakanda.
Can I get you gentlemen a drink? Jack neat.
Great.
And if you give me a little extra, I won't be madÂ at you. You know, 'cause of slavery.
Yeah, um, do you have a Shiraz from Barossa, Bin 28?
No, but we have a really great French Shiraz
and our house Cab is amazing.
Okay, what year's the Cab?
Thirteen. Fantesca from the Spring Mountain.
Okay. Yeah, no, I heard a lot of hype about the thirteen,
but I'm thinking about getting a rib eye, so I wanted something more peppery, smoky.
Well, we do have a Cab-Shiraz blend.
Bin 389, 2010.
Oh, yeah. Let me get that.
Man was just sitting on that Baby Grange.
What's that?
Oh, it's out of Australia, from theÂ Penfolds.
It's, uh... It's this wine. Deep purple.
Ginger, blackberry notes. Super chocolaty finish. It's just good.
Grizzlies gotta start playing more D though.
[Louis] We should've picked up some more charcoal when we were out there.
How much more have we got left?
[Elijah] Like three.
All right.
I could set up the cash register, so it could print receipts or email.
[Elijah] I have a new idea for the restaurant.
You know, we could set up some...
outdoor seating.
-Double our dining space. -[truck bed door clanks shut]
That way, you know, people get to see how the sausage gets made, while the sausage is getting made.
So what do you think?
I could help set it up.
You want to set this up and study for the wine test?
I mean, I was just trying to help you out, so you don't have to do it by yourself.
Don't use me and your mom not here as an excuse.
Excuse for what?
You remember how you said I got stuck working at the barbecue stand?
Yeah. I shouldn't have said that. I'm...
No, it's all right.
I mean, I wanted to knock you out, but...
I didn't know what I wanted to do when Papa asked me to take over the restaurant.
But I knew I had to go all in to find out.
You love this wine thing?
Yeah.

Let me come back to this one.
This wine...
[rustles papers] Let's see. This wine...
This wine is light red.
Like unripe strawberry. [sighs]
Fuck.
Hey, this'll happen.
Just fall back on the grid, and tune everything else out.
I'm gonna go get some more wine.
[Elijah] With the smokiness of the brisket...
pair it with a Barolo, a Syrah, an Australian Shiraz.
The chicken,
I'd pair it with...
a Zinfandel.
Maybe-- Maybe aÂ CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne.
[Elijah] Name for a red and white wine that's made in America

Uh... Saint Meritage.
Wait. Yeah.
Okay, what does "Sori" mean? Sori, um...
Medium minus acidity.
This wine is New World. 2005?
This is from Argentina. This wine is a blend.
Bodega Catena Zapata.
Is this Boone's Farm?
You got something against Strawberry Hill?
Yeah, I'm hoping the drive will clear my head.
I keep getting the, uh... a little shaky on the Californian wines.
Kept on mixing up the Sonoma ones with the Russian River Valley, so...
[zipping] I don't know. We'll see.
[stammers] I know you got your own style and whatnot, but I was...
thinking you might... thought you might wanna wear your grandfather's suit to the... to the test.
Hey.
I remember this suit.
He bought it when he was going to get a loan to open up the restaurant.
Oh, yeah? It brought him good luck?
Hell, no. He was a black man getting a loan in the 1960s.
He was denied by every bank in town. But he eventually won it in a dice game.
This is so cool.
-It still smells like him. -I know.
[Elijah] Oh, yeah...
[Louis] Get you out of here.
-There you go. -[Elijah] All right.
Okay. You, uh...
-[song fades] -So how do you feel?
Nervous.
I mean, I just wanted to get here, you know?
You're gonna do great, babe.
I love you.
Love you, too.
[woman] Mr. Bruener, come with me, please.
Okay.
Mr. Bruener, how are you feeling?
You know, just, uh...
ready.
The first part of the Master exam is blind tasting.
You'll have a total of 25 minutes to correctly identify your six wines.
The clock will start as soon as you touch your first glass.
[man 1] Wine one was clearly a 2012 Maison Verget Meursault Les Clous.
[man 2] I called wine one 2013 Aubert CIX Sonoma Coast Chardonnay.
[man 1] 2008 Vie di Romans Pinot Grigio?
No, it definitely wasn't that. It was too dry.
[man 3] What'd you call wine six?
-[man 2] Number two, Chardonnay. -[man 1] I think so too.
[host speaking indistinctly on TV}
You know this hotel charges $35 for valet parking?
For $35, they bring my car back, Halle Berry had better be inside.
What are you doing here?
If your mom was still here, she would've had us come check on you.
Last thing I need is her haunting my ass from the grave.
How are you feeling?
Tired.
When do you know if you passed?
In the morning.
They have to add up all the scores.
Ten.
Elijah Bruener.
So how do you feel?
It's okay. It's okay.
-Uh-huh. -I know exactly where you're at.
Um, now, you had some things that you did really well.
Like theory.
[voice fades] Tasting was a little tougher for you to find.
Oh, okay.
It's easy to see that you have... [voice fades to silence]
[master sommelier] Patrick Turner.
So, you... you good?
You hungry?
I've got some links and stuff I could bring you.
Um... That's okay. I'm just kind of tired.
You sure? It's already packed up.
Thanks, though.
-Okay. -All right. [sighs]
[Tanya on phone] I'm so sorry, baby.
Did they say how you did or anything?
[Elijah on phone] I passed theory, but I failed tasting.
They said I was a few points short of passing service too, but...
[Tanya] You wanna come by?
[Elijah] I'm good.
[sighs] How much hickory we got?
-Like 200 logs. -Okay.
I gotta get some more after I meet the electrician on Monday,
and then I've gotta interview a new waitress 'cause Sherry's got surgery coming up.
[takes a breath] Yeah. All right, I should get back to this. I've gotta finish up.
I'm gonna get the pasta, the tagliatelle with the ragu, -'cause that looks real good. -Sounds good.
-'cause that looks real good. -Sounds good.
-What are you gonna get? -Uh... I think I wanna get the rib eye.
-Okay. -What's that look you're giving me?
It's just the rib eye also sounds so good.
I'm happy to share it if it's, you know, reciprocal.
Yeah, we can share that if you want. It's just don't eat too much.
-Excuse me. Are you two of legal age? -Oh, look at this guy!
-Hey, man. -[patting backs]
-Hey. -Richie. [kisses]
-You like the suit? I got a suit guy. -[Elijah chuckles]
Not gonna lie, -I really like saying, "I got a suit guy." -[Tanya laughs]
Congratulations again.
Thanks. Uh, so what are we drinking?
Oh, you tell us.
Okay. Uh, well, we have a lot of exciting things on the list that I think you're gonna like.
There is a '98 Sancerre that is absolutely insane.
We have a 2013 Cab Sav from Napa.
It's the Fay from Stag's Leap and it is delicious.
[Louis] And I want six cords of hickory.
-Big logs, no splits. -[Roscoe] Okay.
And that apple you've got. Is it seasoned yet?
-Uh... Just about. -[phone buzzes]
You're killing me, Roscoe. You're just-- -[laughs] -You're just killing me. Killing me.
-[laughs] -You're just killing me. Killing me.
Huh? Hello?
Elijah, where you at?
[Louis] You can't come?
It's alright. [stammers] I'll take care of it. Yeah.
[chuckles] I'll take care of it.
Was that junior?
Yeah. It looks like he ain't gonna make it.
We can just throw all this stuff in the back of the truck.
Doesn't want to work with you, huh?
Guess not.
Can somebody get this dog out of my truck? He's gonna be shitting on my mats.
-[Elijah] Color. This wine is pale yellow. -[overlapping chatter]
Smells of, uh...
Grapefruit, lemon, hints of green apple.
-[student 1] Hints of melon. -[Elijah] Acidity, medium minus.

-["One Hunnid" by Marco PavÃ© plays] -This wineÂ is about three to five years old.
This wine is Old World. This wine's from France.
This wine is from Burgundy. This wine is aÂ Pouilly-FuissÃ©.
but I still have my weak moments.
I ask my counselor all the time. I'm like, "It's almost nine years."
"When am I gonna get over it?"
She says, "You're not."
Throughout my life, the only place I felt safe was in the boxing ring.
[newsman] She's had the most knockouts in the history of women's boxing.
[Christy] Number one, there are rules. Every punch is planned.
[newsman] She is the world's best. The most famous female boxer.
[Christy] Number two, I had so much anger.
The only placeÂ that I could let it out was in the boxing ring.
[Christy] And number three, boxing was my survival.
[newsman] A champion female boxer living a secret double life.
It was preparing me for how I was gonna escape my own destiny.
[Christy] Hit me as hard as you want, as many times as you want,
and I might get beaten,
and I might get knocked down,
but, motherfucker, you cannot kill me.
[Joyce] Christy just started boxing on a dare from her classmates in college
to enter a Toughman Contest.
[Johnny] She'd never done any fighting or anything.
Well, she'd been in some fights, butâ€¦ [laughs] it wasn't in a ring.
-[laughing] I was going like this. -[producer laughs]
[Johnny] Christy threw one punch,
and she was looking around in the ring, trying to find her.
She was laying at her feet. She done knocked her out.
[Christy] She was big. Five-nine, 150 pounds,
and I knocked her out with one punch.
I've never even been in a boxing gym before.
To land that knockout punch is like the biggest high you could ever have.
[Christy] I fought three times. I won 300 dollars.
But I got hooked.
Money, money, money!
[Christy] And after one of the fights, a promoter told me that he had this trainer
a promoter told me that he had this trainer from Bristol, Tennessee that could train me.
from Bristol, Tennessee that could train me.
[Joyce] Christy Salters. Champion.
[Christy] His name was Jim Martin. He had 26 professional boxing matches.
He sparred with Marvin Johnson, the great light heavyweight champion.
So it got me excited, like, "Wow, I can do this. I've got it."
The first dayÂ I went into the boxing gym to meet Jim Martin,
my mother was with me,
and I had my little baby Pomeranian,
but as I walked in, you could feel the air go out of the gym.
Like, "Oh my God, what's about to happen?"
And when I first met Jim,
I asked, you know, "Where's the dressing room for me to change?"
He wouldn't even tell me. No one would even tell me where the bathroom was.
[Jim] You get inside that gym,
inside that ring, inside that arena,
you're on my territory.
I didn't want nothing to do with women boxing, and I didn't wanna be laughed out of the sport.
A promoter pressured me into training Christy,
but instead, I told one of my little fighters,
"Look, I'm gonna put her in with you and bust her up a little bit and get her outta here."
He wanted him to break my ribs so I wouldn't wanna be in the gym,
but it didn't happen because my mother was there.
I got her mother and a little baby Pomeranian dog,
which hated me.
So I had to cancel it.
My fighters kept saying, "Give her a chance.Â Give her a chance."
"Work with her a bit and see what happens."
I said, "Okay, I'll give her a chance. Let's see what she's got."
[Jim] When I first trained Christy,
I'm going like, "Man, thisâ€¦ this woman, she don't know anything."
She's like walking on crutches she's so damn clumsy.
But then we seen she had a real good chin.
You have a chin or you don't.
Christy's got a granite chin.
Hit her with a sledgehammer, and she's still standing there, looking at you.
I said, "I'm gonna make you a fighter."
Come on.
[Jim] So we start looking for the ideal sparring partner.
And she found him. [laughs]
Jim was like, "Hey, I got somebody wants to spar with you."
I'm like, "Shit. Where they at?"
I walk in, and I'm seeing the new guy.
You know, I hear, "Pow. Pow, pow."
It sounds like a bomb.
"Damn, whoâ€¦ who's this?"
I look closer, and it was a girl. "What the hell?"
-[grunts] -[Jim] "That's who they want you to spar." "What? Hell no! I'm not getting in a ring with that girl. You crazy?"
"What? Hell no! I'm not getting in a ring with that girl. You crazy?"
But I guess we clicked.
She gave me several black eyes and fat lips and all that good stuff.
I tell a lot of the guys I spar with, "I know a girl who hits harder than you."
She does. She hits harder than half the lightweights out there.
[Christy] As time went on, I proved to him that, "I'm here. I'm gonna stay here."
"I don't care what you dish out, no matter how hard you make me work."
"Because of who I am, I'm gonna try to do it better than everybody else in the gym."
[Jim] Man, she works harder than my men fighters.
She does everything I say.
If I'd told her to jump off the roof, I believe she'd do it.
Then he started saying what he's famous for saying, thatâ€¦
I said, "Christy, I'm gonna make you the best woman fighter in the world."
I thought he was full of crap. I didn't think it was gonna go anywhere.
Even if you make me the best woman fighter, soâ€¦
No one's doing it. No one's getting paid to do it.
[announcer] In the lightweight division, from West Virginia,
let's welcome Christy Martin.
[Jim] When Christy came onto the scene, I called fight promoters.
"I'm trying to get Christy on this fight card."
They said, "Tell you what. I'll put her on there, but I'm not paying her."
Everybody thought it was a joke.
The next fight, a promoter gave us a bunch of tickets.
I said, "What's this?"
He said, "Whatever tickets you sell is gonna be your purse."
We sold two tickets.
Christy fought for 60 dollars.
[Christy] I was so broke, but Jim kept saying,
"This boxing thing is gonna work."
And the trainer-boxer relationship, you have to believe in them, trust in them.
Your life is inâ€¦ in that trainer's hands.
I looked up to him.
He was in my corner.
[Jim] I always ranked myself between the number one to the number five best coach in the world,
but I needed a good product to work with,
and I feel like I had a good product with Christy.
She was a Mike Tyson-type fighter.
Boy, this girl can punch.
She's gone! She's gone!
[Christy] We had everybody standing on their feet.
Everybody couldn't believe a woman was doing this.
Fight promoters, they would even tell us, "My God, she stole my crowd."
"She was the best fight of the night. Everybody loved her."
[woman] Christy!
But it wasn't about being a woman fighter. I just wanted to be a fighter.
[Christy] After one of the fights, you're so excited. Everybody's so happy.
And I kissed him.
[sighs] I can'tâ€¦ I don't evenâ€¦ I don't even know what happened.
[announcer] â€¦by way of West Virginia,
introducing Christy "The Coal Miner's Daughterâ€¦"
[Chrsity] I am truly a coal miner's daughter,
coal miner's granddaughter.
So I grew up in coal mining country.
-[gentle atmospheric music plays] -[train horn honks]
[Christy] It's good people.
There's just not a lot there.
Not even a town. It's just a little stretch of road.
But when my grandmother passed, I wanted to buy the house,
so I would have a place to stay when I came to visit my family.
Andâ€¦ I feel guilty because I have let it run down.
I feel guilty because I have let it run down.
But, hopefully, we'll get that all turned around
and get it back to where it should be.
I think it's important for you to always be able to go home.
-[piano gently plays] -[Joyce] When Christy was growing up,
everybody calls her Sis.
Sis was just energetic. She didn't ever just sit and watch TV.
My dad was an athlete, so I played Little League baseball.
Actually, I played for the boys' team.
[Johnny] And she didn't play just anyplace.
She was a catcher.
[Christy] And I played basketball.
I was pretty good, actually.
She was All-State two years, so she was great.
I met Sherry through basketball.
She was, like, the star athlete of Mullins High School.
You wanna be friends and be close to the person that's the star.
She just asked me, "Could we work out together andâ€¦ and shoot ball together?"
"Could we work out together andâ€¦ and shoot ball together?"
But then feelings started to happen that were,
you know, they're not the normal kind of feelings.
[Sherry] It was the blooming of aâ€¦
I didn't know what it was. There wasn't references.
There's no Internet. There's no talking to anybody.
And, you know, you know you had to hide it.
[Christy] In my opinion, most everyone knew or suspected,
but my parents turned a blind eye.
[Joyce] In high school,
Sis always had girlfriends.
I mean, you know, friends.
[Sherry] There's no way they couldn't know with me coming in at those times.
I think they were just in denial.
That's not what you want for your child.
I just wasn't raised like that.
I had to hold in who I truly am,
and I was angry.
But I'm not so sure if I didn't have all this stuff inside of me
that I could have become the fighter that I was.
-[Christy grunting] -[Jim] I just ended up caring for her.
I always wanted to protect her.
That was in everything. I don't know whyâ€¦ how that came about.
Went from a hate situation to a love situation,
'cause I hated she was in the gym, you know, when she first come in.
[Joyce] We were very surprised when they became romantically involved
because he was so much older than she was.
There was a big age difference, because he's older than I am.
[Jim] Smile.
[Joyce] Jim was good to her.
He looked out for her.
I loved him just like he was a son.
[Jim] I was never with any other woman like I was with Christy.
Nothing ever embarrassed her to talk to me about.
[Christy] I felt like I could tell him all about me,
even all the bad things about past relationships with women.
That bothered me.
And if I'd known that off the bat, she wouldn't even have stayed in the gym.
But Christy's past is her past.
Her past has nothing to do with our future.
I think we went to Kmart or Walmart
and bought two rings, you know,
and, uh, went and got married.
[Christy] Really, when I married Jim, I married boxing.
He gave me an opportunity, and I was ready to take advantage of the opportunity
andâ€¦ and ride it to the fullest.
Now, it's up to me as a promoter to create what I call the magic of excitement,
and this is what separates me from "mediocracy" to excellence.
Love him or hate him, Don King was the world's greatest boxing promoter.
Brought some of the greatest fights to boxing.
[newsman] A new era in boxing.
[Christy] And promoted all these legends.
I never sat back and thought,
"I'm gonnaÂ be boxing for Don King someday."
I mean, why would he sign a woman?
But everything's about timing.
Finally, we arrange a meeting to go down to Don King's office.
Don King Productions.
[Christy] First time a woman boxer was gonna meet him,
so I take a VHS tape. I pop it in.
Well, his VCR is not working.
So I just get up and start shadow boxing for him.
And he starts that famous Don King laugh.
And he says, "I love you. Sign her up. Let's get it done."
And we said, "Can we take that contract and let our lawyer read it?"
He said, "That contract don't leave this table."
Then he said, "What'd you fight for your last fight?"
"Well, we only made a few hundred dollars."
He said,Â "Do you wanna fight for 5,000 dollars a fight or for a couple hundred dollars?"
We said, "Give us that contract."
-[producer] How'd you feel? -[clears throat]
Rich.
Well, let me introduce to you the first lady of boxing, Christy Martin.
A dynamic, beautiful boxing/fighting sensation.
[Christy] He promoted me just like he promotes his male fighters.
"I'm gonna put you out there, Christy, sink or swim."
I fought all over. I mean, I was fighting in Vegas every two weeks.
I got no breaks.
I got no special treatment.
I felt like I had to bring a lot of action because I can't give anyone an excuse
to say something negative about my fight.
[commentator] Christy Martin in the pink, going right after Sonja Dunlavey.
She can hit, and she's an athlete, so watch her moves.
Look at this!
Oh! Right hand!
She may be out.
It's all over.
King's all about the dollar,
and he knew that I was making waves and I was getting the fans excited.
[Jimmy] When Christy fought "Slammin'" Sue Chase, I hear this, "Boom, boom, boom."
I look back, and I was like, "Oh my God!" It's Mike Tyson right there, man. Just cheering Christy on.
It's Mike Tyson right there, man. Just cheering Christy on.
[commentator] What an exchange this is!
[Mike Tyson] I believe I was in jail,
and they were talking about Coal Miner's Daughter,
she's knocking out people, and she's really exciting.
And I'm like, "Get the fuck outta here," you know?
But then I started going to some of her fights.
She throws a lot of hard punches, crowd-pleasing.
She gave everybody their money's worth.
[commentator] She's not being thrown off.
So I said, "Put Christy Martin on my undercard."
[Christy] I could never dream that I would be on Mike Tyson's card.
I mean, how can this be? I'm from a town of 500 people in southern West Virginia,
and here I am in the middle of this huge fight on a pay-per-view show.
[announcer] Mike Tyson returning live on pay-per-view from the MGM Grand.
That might have been the first time where I was like, "Oh shit," you know,
"I've made itÂ if I can pull it off today."
[commentator] Martin taking on Ireland's Deirdre Gogarty.
The first women's bout shown on pay-per-view.
From a fighter's perspective, this is really big.
Half of the planet's watching her.
-[crowd chanting] Bruno! -Fifth round, Tyson knocks him out! [crowd] Bruno! Bruno!
Phew. Wow.
-Okay. -I don't know if it's gonna be my day. It's all right. Just all tension and nerves.
[Jim] Christy prayed before the fight.
I'm a nervous wreck too,
but I don't let her see it.
My job was to build her up.
You okay?
[Jim] Don King was scared to death.
He said, "Oh my God, if this thing falls through,
people are gonna hang me."
[Jim] He said, "Christy, don't let me down." "Please don't let me down. Make this a good fight."
"Please don't let me down. Make this a good fight."
[Christy] As I walked out into the fight, I can hear that people booed me.
Like, "Oh my God, I'm getting booed in front of 100,000 people."
[man] I didn't wanna see a girls' fight,
and I wasn't too impressed by the fact that we had one.
[Jim] It made me so damn mad.
[Deirdre] There was a lot of drunk people shouting obscenities.
"Now we gotta watch a women's novelty sideshow."
[Deirdre] "Oh lord, this is not going well already."
[announcer] This is a female special attraction in the lightweight division.
[Christy] I was so excited,
but yet I was so scared.
But then it was like, boom, the switch flipped.
Go to your corner and wait for the bell. Good luck.
[Christy] If you want the fans to remember your name,
you have to go out and make a statement.
[commentator] She can punch! Look at that, what an athlete!
Oh, down goes Gogarty.
And she fights back, unloading on Christy Martin.
Martin swinging wildly.
-Oh man! -[crowd cheering]
Back comes Gogarty again.
Whoo! It was just a war, back and forth.
The crowd was going crazy.
Everybody, everybody, they were cheering both of us.
Yeah! Yeah!
[commentator] I'm no doctor, but that's a broken nose.
They couldn't get my nose to stop bleeding.
[doctor] Good job.
[Christy] The doctor would come into my corner,
and I said, "Look, I'm fine. Do not stop the fight."
[commentator] She is bleeding profusely. I've never seen this.
[Jim] All the movie stars come out of their seats.
"Damn, there's a hell of a fight going on here."
-[commentator] This is entertainment. -[Jimmy] Boy, it showed the whole world
-[commentator] This is entertainment. -[Jimmy] Boy, it showed the whole world two women that could fight like that,
that had heart like that, that could bleed like that,
and still come out from round to round to round.
[commentator] Another furious exchange.
And it was a great feeling. Boy, the crowd went nuts over it.
[commentator] Both fighters showing tremendous heart.
I guaranteeÂ neither of those young ladies was paid enough
for the efforts they put forth here tonight.
[Christy] I was uncertain about the decision,
but I knew we had put on one hell of a fight.
[announcer] All three in favor of the winner,
"The Coal Miner's Daughter" Christy Martin.
[Jim] I'm standing over in the corner.
I'm just proud when I know that she does what I taught her.
[Christy] I had given it every ounce of energy that I had for that fight.
I remember, I actually laid down in the shower and I thought I was dying.
When I got back to my room that night, my voicemail in my hotel room was full,
and the requests were from, um, The Today Show, Leno Show, Conan O'Brien,
and I was hurt because Iâ€¦ I called my PR guy,
and I'm like, "Why would somebody play such a bad joke on me?"
"I foughtâ€¦ I really fought hard."
He says,Â "You don't understand, honey. That's for real."
I'm like, "What?"
Christy Martin battled Deirdre Gogarty for six brutal rounds
in front of millions on television in 170 countries.
All the talk was about Martin-Gogarty.
There wasn't a person I was with who didn't come away tremendously impressed.
Many boxing fans said the Martin-Gogarty fight, with no disrespect to the others,
was the most exciting and competitive bout that night.
To get fight of the night on a Tyson show, you don't even dream that.
I believe she broke her nose, blood streaming the entire fight.
[Christy] The blood everywhere made everybody stand up and take notice.
Probably the most lucrative bloody nose in the history of boxing.
Christy Martin's fight that night put women's boxing on the map.
No doubt she put it on the map.
Eighty million viewers actually watched our fight.
[Christy] I feel like I was ready to take advantage of the opportunity.
So many people were telling me, "You can't do it. You'll never make it."
All right, just watch.
-[announcer] Christy Martin! -[crowd cheering]
The best female boxer out there. Please welcomeÂ Christy Martin.
-[cameras clicking] -[Jim] She's a star.
All the movie stars knew her. All the sports people knew her.
People overseas knew her.
[newsman] We're discouraged from getting involved romantically with the people we cover.
I thought, "Oh, there's Sis."
"Sis is famous."
If I'm gonna hit someone, I'm gonna try to hit them on the chin orâ€¦
I went on to all those shows. Just one after another.
Christy Martin took the boxing world by storm last month.
Her performance in the ring landed her on the cover of Sports Illustrated.
When they told me, "You're gonna be on the cover of Sports Illustrated."
"You gotta be kidding me!"
[newswoman] She is the first female boxer to earn that distinction.
[Christy] I went to the store and bought one so the guy would have to look at the magazine, look up at me,
and he doesn't notice!
[broadcaster] Once considered the lowest rung on the boxing ladder,
women are now a curiosity and great demand.
[Christy] All of a sudden,
promoters were putting a women's fight on every single card.
[commentator] She's taking some shots from Christy Martin right now. Wow!
Everybody fought their A game against me, their A-plus game because it was their Super Bowl.
[commentator] Look at them, toe-to-toe!
And I always felt like everybody's waiting for me to make a mistake.
[commentator] Look at this war! Wow, how about that?
That wasn't gonna happen. I would just go harder.
[commentator] Look at this spinningâ€¦
She goes in the ring for one play. That's to put you on the mat.
She hurts when she hits! [laughs]
[Christy] Every punch I threw, I wanted to knock someone out.
I mean, the adrenaline rush puts you so high.
[broadcaster] Don King signed Christy to a four-year contract,
promising to make her a millionaire.
[Jim] We got cars. We got basketball courts.
[Jim] We got cars. We got basketball courts. We got a swimming pool. We got jewelry.
We got a swimming pool. We got jewelry. We got clothes that would fill half this room.
We got everything.
We were really rich.
Best in the world, baby. Best in the world.
Look at how far she made it, how high she made it.
-[crowd cheering] -It's a dream come true for all of us.
[Christy] I was on top of the world.
The crowd was going nuts, chanting, "Christy, Christy, Christy!"
[Lisa] 90% of every punch that we threw in the gym
had Christy Martin's face on it.
[announcer] From Crawford, Texas, it's Lisa Holewyne!
[Lisa] She was the champion that other fighters couldn't wait to see fall.
I get a lot of criticism from other women fighters
because they think I should put them on my shoulders
and carry them to the forefront. Hey, this is business, you know. I worry about promoting Christy Martin.
Hey, this is business, you know. I worry about promoting Christy Martin.
[Lisa] Christy was outspoken,
easy to dislike.
[Christy] Women today are making more money than ever for one reason.
That's because of the showÂ Christy Martin puts on every time that I go out there.
So, I really think they should all be sending me 10% of their purse. [laughs]
[Lisa] There was a huge difference
between Christy Martin and all the other females.
Certainly, every female fighter had a job and had to figure out a way to take off for fights.
And she could have said,
"There are other women out there that are good."
Occasionally, she could have mixed that in.
[Jim] I always said when Christy gets out of boxing,
there isn't gonna be more women boxing. You know why?
'Cause she wasÂ effeminate.
Christy's image was as important as her boxing skills.
Christy was known as the girl next door,
and she wasn't going in there looking like a boy, acting like a boy.
She's like a typical housewife. She cooks, does her hair, does her fingernails.
Am I allowed to make you blush a little bit?
-[Christy] Sure. -You have a very lovely smile.
You have very attractive features.
Okay.
[Jim] I mean, who puts butts in the seats?
Men.
If Christy didn't sell any tickets,
I don't care how good she was,
Don King would not have had her on those cards.
I'd like to say one thing. Andrea, you have a nice dress.
This is the first time I've seen you dressed respectable, looking like a woman.
[Christy] The whole pre-fight hype bullshit,
I-- I enjoyed it.
You know, small town West Virginia, Coal Miner's Daughter, baby.
She ain't for ****. That's why she gotta steal on somebody.
I told Christy Martin, "Good luck."
I got told, "Good luck getting knocked the fuck out."
Well, I said so many bad things.
I'm gonna put something on you you never had before.
Maybe only from your girlfriend. I don't know. Maybe she put it on you.
-[crowd] Oh! -What's that?
You know what.
I mean, I said a lot of really rude comments about, uh,
homosexuals.
[Jim] There are women fighters who come in like, you know,
wear a flannel shirt, driving a Jeep,
chopped-off hairdo, and sorta manly type.
[Christy] But also, Jim did encourage that behavior,
and I would tell him, "Jim, you don't understand."
"I'm gonna keep saying this stuff, and somebody from my past is gonna peep up."
[commentator 1] Because Christy Martin has a problem with her opponent's sexuality,
she'll throw her kisses before the fight.
[commentator 2]Â Mmm. That oughta rile her up.
But it didn't happen, and I continued to say negative things.
First, she will have to prove to me and doctors that she is a woman,
and, um, we canâ€¦ we can hook that fight up as soon as she proves that.
-[reporter] That she's a woman? -That she's a woman.
[Lisa] We were all struggling with the same identity in a male sport.
There weren't many female athletes
brave enough to be who they were at that time,
myself included.
You think you're a man and punch like a man. You don't even hit like a boy.
You think you're a man and punch like a man. You don't even hit like a boy. You're a punk.
Christy, I like the way you talk. You walk that walk and talk that talk.
But if you're gonna open your mouth and say it, you better back it up.
[Lisa] I was getting ready to fight her, and I was pumped.
"I'm way too strong for this girl. I'm way too big for this girl."
"Have her come at me. Have her come at me."
"She's going down."
[Christy] She was much bigger, much stronger than me.
Lisa was a world champion too,
so I had to actually use my brain.
So I watched how all these big legends fought.
Sugar Ray Robinson, Ali, Frazier, Carmen Basilio.
All those guys are great chess players.
They're able to set you up for, not your next move, their next move.
[Lisa] I'm like, "She's gonna come right to me. She's gonna come right to me.
Well, Christy didn't do that.
[Christy] I decided when to step in and throw combinations,
when to load up and throw one big right hand.
[Lisa] I was frustrated, surprised.
You couldn't have told me that this girl had good feet
and good moves and good defense,
because most women didn't make her have to show that.
Oh, Christy could box.
She would keep everything short and sweet.
Slip. Come back. [punching sound] Back.
[punching sound] Back.
When Lisa and Christy both came in the ring,
George Foreman said, "This little girl won't win this fight."
At about the third round, he said,
"This little girl is gonna win this fight." [laughs]
[Jim] She couldn't stand toe-to-toe with Christy.
Lisa got her ass beat.
[announcer] The winner, "The Coal Miner's Daughter" Christy Martin.
Biggest stage of my career. It sucks.
[Jimmy] After that fight, Christy was well on the way of being almost untouchable.
[Christy] Yeah, in front of the camera, it was great.
I mean, I would not trade my career for anyone's.
But my personal and private life,
it was so much the opposite.
[Don King] This is her husband and trainer, Mr. Martin. He's a tough guy.
[Christy] From early on, Don King used being married as a selling point,
so Jim also became a star.
Talk about packing a punch. You're about to meet a husband and wife team you won't forget.
She is the professional boxer. He is the trainer. They're a knockout.
One little kiss.
[Jim] People in the media would always say, "You guys made history together." Mwah.
You say Christy, you say Jim. You say Jim, you say Christy.
Jim, get in here and turn around and get in that shot. First time--
His identity became me.
He would call somebody. He never said, "This is Jim Martin."
He would call somebody. He never said, "This is Jim Martin." "This is Jim andÂ Christy Martin."
Oh, obviously, we have our ups and downs, as any fighter-trainer would,
but, um, sometimes it's a little tougher
because if we have problems at the gym, it'll go home with us.
Or if we have problems at home, it'll come to the gym with us,
but we're doing better.
[Christy] It was just all so intertwined that I couldn't get away.
We've been together seven years. In seven years,
maybe we've spent one night away from each other.
Christy and I, we have no children. We don't get tired of each other.
Christy and I, we have no children. We don't get tired of each other. We just do everything together, and that's just what we like, you know.
We just do everything together, and that's just what we like, you know.
[Jim] She didn't go out with women friends. I didn't go out with men friends.
I didn't want to go out with any men friends.
She was my life. She was my whole life.
[Christy] I mean, he was a great coach for an amateur just starting out.
One, two.
[Christy] But now, when I would watch guys that train real championsâ€¦
I realized that I wanted to have a better trainer.
After so many years,
Jim had taught me all he could teach me.
And even if he wants to still be the co-trainer,
I would ask him to at least bring in somebody else,
so I could go to that next level,
but he didn't want me to have anybody else in my corner.
We worked so hard to make this great big bill.
You would think she'd had a little bit more respect for me.
My husband's my trainer and my manager, full-time, like, 24-hour-a-day boss.
Could you knock him out?
Um, no, but some days I might like to.
-[Jay Leno] Yeah. -Yeah. [laughs] I bet when this couple fightsâ€¦
Christy needed some sparring, so we put the gloves on.
You know, we sparred.
[Christy] He's 25 years older,
so I was hesitant to go 100% all-out.
But then, he just, heâ€¦
He knocked me out.
I've never been knocked out.
I've never been dropped, even.
You know when you're hitting someone in the right spot,
hitting someone hard enough to knock them out.
He knew exactly what he was doing.
I wasn't trying to kill her. You know what I mean?
But I was letting her know she didn't belong in there with me.
[Christy] No matter how good I thought I was
or how tough I thought I was, he wanted to show me he was the boss.
It takes a little cockiness out of them.
You know?
[Christy] Is it abuse?
Yeah, he's smart.
He disguised it.
Have you ever been knocked out?
-No. [knocks on desk] -[Jay Leno] Oh no. Wow.
[Christy] And all I wanted to do was leave him.
All I wanted to do was live my life freely.
So, yeah.
I should have.
[Laila] Christy Martin reached out and wanted to fight.
I remember thinking it was a joke. Like, "Really?" [laughs]
Like, "Really?"
Oh my God! Because, come on.
I mean, I'm 168 pounds. I'm five-eleven.
I'm big, I'm strong. What is little Christy gonna do with me?
[announcer] Laila Ali!
[Laila] Most people assume I started boxing
[Laila] Most people assume I started boxing 'cause I said, "I wanna be like my dad."
That isn't what happened at all.
When I sawÂ Christy and Deirdre fighting, I remember thinkingâ€¦ [gasps]
When I sawÂ Christy and Deirdre fighting, I remember thinkingâ€¦ [gasps] "I wanna do that."
So I decided, "I'm gonna start training."
I got a call to spar with Christy when she was getting ready to fight Laila Ali.
And I was over it enough.
Almost. You never really get over a loss.
I remember feeling like, "This is odd."
Ali's a big girl.
Ali was bigger than me by 15-20 pounds.
I was bigger than Christy by ten pounds, and Ali was the younger one.
That was an insane matchup.
[Christy] We were the two biggest names at the time.
And Jim was all about, "It'll be the biggest fight in women's boxing history."
I had never seen Laila Ali in person.
So when I actually saw her, I was like, "Oh shit, this is a big woman."
[Jimmy] Christy had to weigh in with army pants on, boots,
and quarters in her pockets. [laughs]
You stood up to me, little mama. You stood up--
Laila! Break it up!Â Break it up!
[Laila] She wasn't intimidating me. I was talking down to her,
and she felt my power, and I did notice a bit of a change in her
because now she realized, "Okay, this is real."
Jim was talking to me, and I said, "I don't know about this fight,"
and I'm watching my words
because I'm talking to somebody's husband and trainer
about their fighter and wife.
[Jim] Everybody always says to me, "It's your wife in there."
I say, you know what,
if I sat there and said, "Oh wow, my wife just took a hard shot,"
"Oh wow, my wife's got eyes a little bit swelled-up,"
by focusing on that, I'm not doing my job.
[Lisa] And so, he said, "Well, I think she can do it."
It was, like, "Conversation over."
[commentator] We're about to witness the most important fight
in the history of women's boxing.
We've waited for months, and now it's here.
[Christy] We sold over 100,000 pay-per-view buys. We sold the arena out in Biloxi. They had to add chairs.
We sold the arena out in Biloxi. They had to add chairs.
To this day, it's still the biggest fight in women's boxing history.
[commentator] The anticipation, the sizzle in this arena is tremendous.
The title of women's pound-for-pound best.
Christy Martin will be outweighed.
She promises not to be outgunned.
First bell rang, Laila hit me with a right hand high on my headâ€¦
[commentator] Ali, that overhand right!
â€¦and it just knocked my equilibrium off.
I felt like I was fighting and standing on an angle.
[commentator] Look at the look on Christy Martin's face.
She's doing everything in her power to hang in there.
[Jim] Christy came back to the corner, and she said, "Am I fighting crooked?"
And I said, "No, you're fighting up straight."
She said, "I feel like I'm fighting on a slant."
[Jimmy] I can see the glaze and distance in her eyes.
She was fighting on pure gut and instinct.
[commentator] â€¦as Laila Ali continues to drop bombs.
And Martin is in trouble!
[Christy] I kept trying to hang in there, go a little bit longer,
thinking my head would clear.
[commentator] Martin just not able to punch back!
[Christy] But no matter what I hit her with, she was on me,
and I couldn't get her off of me. I couldn't breathe.
[commentator] She just collapses in the corner.
That's a dangerous fight when you're in there with someone bigger, stronger,
and you're not seeing straight.
[commentator] How much punishment can she absorb?
[Laila] It's the corner's responsibility
to throw in the towel if they have to. It's important for that person to step up.
-Put the heat on her, okay? -Right.
-[Christy] I told him I'm dizzy. -[Jim] Run around, okay?
[Christy] I'm sure I have a concussion, but he was just like, "Nah, you'll be fine. You'll be fine."
-[whistle blows] -[commentator] Rapid fire. Again and again and again!
[Christy] Jim could have saved me.
He could have stepped up and stopped the fight.
That's what a coach does. That's what a good coach does for their fighter, but he didn't.
[commentator] Laila Ali has driven her to her knees.
[Christy] So I took a knee.
Probably if I have to say what's the worst ten seconds of your life,
that's probably the worst ten seconds of my life.
That I stayedÂ onâ€¦ on the knee.
[commentator] She has never been off her feet until now.
[Christy] He could have stepped up and stopped it.
I could always say, "Jim stopped it. I didn't quit."
But I quit, and that's hard for me to live with.
[commentator] It is over,
and Laila Ali is the reigning champion of women's boxing.
[Jim] When she hit Christy, that was a lucky punch.
I wanted a rematch on that fight.
[Christy] I remember laying in my dressing room that night.
Jim wasn't even there toâ€¦ to make sure I was okay.
He was out talking to everybody else.
[Jimmy] Christy had at least 30-something fights she never lost.
After so many years being on top,
just seeing yourâ€¦
â€¦ you know, your best friend, basically, pretty much getting whooped.
Yeah, it was pretty rough.
[commentator] â€¦absorbing the worst beating of her career.
At age 35,
you wonder where she goes from here.
-[Jim] You get some coke? -[Christy] No, but I'm about to get some.
-[Jim] Huh? -[Christy] I'm about to get some.
[Christy] Oh my lord.
[Jim] One of my fighters brought some cocaine over one night
and says, "You've been asking me to give up cocaine."
"I'm giving it up. Here's my cocaine."
I take it in the house. "Christy, look what Derek gave me."
[Christy] I left it laying there for a couple days.
And then finally, I was like, "You know, I'm so miserable."
"Just letâ€¦ let me try it. Let me do it."
It went from Friday, Saturday to Friday, Saturday, and Sundayâ€¦
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
â€¦to six and seven days a week.
We had coke at the gym.
She'd work out.
Work on that right hand.
Take coke.
Work out.
Take coke.
If I would be hitting the heavy bag, like, "Jim, I'm so tired." "I don't have any more."
He would say, "Keep hitting the bag." He would cut up a line, bring it.
I had still my gloves on.
You know, I was high all the time,
but I couldn't stop.
I didn't wanna stop.
I would cut up lines into my own little baggie and hide it,
and then I would go back to get it, and it would be gone,
but, you know, that's because he had cameras.
He was videotaping everything I was doing in the house
without me knowing.
Oh shit. Now, James, you get to scaring me when you do that stuff.
-[Jim] What? -You scare me when you do that stuff.
[Christy] I would call him the Puppet Master.
He's controlling everything.
I would have to perform whatever it might be
in order to get the next line of coke.
[Jim] Oh, I got you on candid camera when you come in.
[Christy] What do you mean? I wasn't coming in there.
Anyone that's addicted, they're gonna do just about anything to get that next line.
[Jim] Christy Martin is ready to come in with a big dick on.
He got sexual satisfaction from me wearing a strap-on all the time,
and that was strange to me.
Why do you wanna see this?
[Jim] Oh, look for me.
Okay. Hang on. Right there.
I would tell him, "You know that I'm a lesbian
so let's get divorced. I'm begging you to please divorce me."
I went as far as to write up a contract.
"I'll take care of all these expenses. Just please leave,"
and, um, he hit me and, you know, knocked my tooth through my lip.
Blood went everywhere.
[producer] Did she talk to you about wanting a divorce?
No. Never.
[producer] She mentioned to me that she drew up a contract at one point
that said, "Let's just go our separate ways."
-Yeah, we did talk about that one time. -[producer[ Can you tell me about that?
I don't think it wasâ€¦ I think it was short-lived.
But she would say things like that, then she'd come back and apologize.
[Christy] My parents came to see me, and I took my mom outside and told her then,
and I took my mom outside and told her then, "Jim is videotaping and audiotaping
everything that's said and happens inside the house."
[Joyce] I could see her standing right now telling me,
and I thought she was just more or less saying that Jim was crazy.
[Christy] Jim was a master manipulator,
and he had conned my mother into thinking that she had to stay close to him
in order to know what I was doing.
So I don't think she believed me, but maybe, you know, I thought she would tell my dad.
but maybe, you know, I thought she would tell my dad.
[Johnny] She told me there was some of that going on,
but there wasâ€¦ there was nothing I could do.
I can't live your life for you.
You have to live it yourself.
You have to make your own decisions.
[announcer] The women have put on a show tonight.
[Christy] I don't even know what my record is from that point on.
It's more losses than wins,
but he wouldn't allow me to quit.
And I'm like, "Why am I here?"
'Cause I was Jim Martin's personal ATM,
and I didn't know how to get out of the situation I was in.
I was high one night and just looked at my Facebook page,
and I had a message from Sherry.
So after 20-some years or whatever, Facebook comes up.
There comes Christy's picture up on "you might be friends."
So I sent her a friend request with a little note that said,
"Is friends what we should be called?"
So it just started, back and forth.
"Hey, how are you? What's up with your mom and dad?"
I mean, she knows my family, I know all of her family.
So it was easy. It was comfortable.
From the beginning,Â she was telling me very deeply serious things.
So I knew she was unhappy in her marriage.
At first, it was just on Facebook, then I'm like, "This is crazy
because he's reading everything that is said on Facebook," so she would text me.
I'm like, "He's reading everything, all my texts, too, so just call me."
[Jim] I didn't ask her about it for a while. I didn't wanna ask her about it.
I'm going, "What the hell?"
"What's this all about?"
I was so unhappy,
and so finally I just told him, "I'm gonna go see Sherry."
"So what are you gonna meetâ€¦ You gonna meet Sherry over there?"
That's like me meeting one of my ex-girlfriends.
She told me, "Just talked about old times," you know.
Of course I didn't believe that.
First he said, "Can I go?"
And I said, "Uh, absolutely not."
And, um, then he said,
"You know, if you leave, I'll kill you."
And I turned around and stopped, and I looked him straight in the eye,
and I said, "Do what you have to do,"
and I left.
When she shows up, we see each other, and itâ€¦
When she shows up, we see each other, and itâ€¦ You know, it wasâ€¦
I could barely breathe.
And she grabs me.
And when she kisses me,
we took that time to shoot right back to high school.
I think we both were floating.
[Joyce] Jim started calling.
"Sis has done this, and she's not coming home."
"Will you call her? Will you call her?"
Jim was calling everybody, trying to find me.
Yeah, he called looking for her.
He just couldn't get her back on the leash.
I did call Sis, and I told her she needed to get home.
[Sherry] And then her mom couldn't get her back onÂ the leash either.
[Jim] So I'm waiting at home. I don't know where she's at.
Finally, she went and picked up the phone,
She told me I was gonna crash and burn.
Then he starts calling everybody, from my relatives to friends, you know,
"Christy's a lesbian. She's left me for a woman."
[Sherry] And he had started texting pictures to everybody.
Everyone.
[Joyce] Jim said, "I'm gonna send you a picture."
It was a terrible picture.
I'd come to find out he had sent that same picture to a lot of people.
He was taking a wrecking ball to everything in her life.
This was my revenge.
Well, what more can you do to me?
Monday, I went to Daytona to see Sherry,
and he called me,
and he said, "I'm so close, I could reach out and touch you."
And I looked around, and I'mâ€¦ you know, trying to find him.
Iâ€¦ I can't see him anywhere.
"I seen you and Sherry."
"You didn't see Sherry and I."
I said, "Yes, I did." "So what did Sherry have on?"
I said, "She had a purple backpack on her left shoulder."
She just got quiet.
She didn't sayâ€¦ She knew I did then.
And I said, "Let's go home."
[Joyce] Fifteen to four, he called me. He told me,
"She's home."
I go in to go to the bedroom.
She's coming down the hallway.
I'm like, "Look, my head is killing me. I'm gonna lay down for about 30 minutes."
And the entire time I'm laying down,
I hear him out there sharpening a knife.
Christy went to take her nap. She called me when she got up.
And, umâ€¦
Jim came in the room.
She says to me, "He's got something behind his back."
He kept putting his hand behind his back, behind his back,
like, three or four times.
I heard him saying to her, "I've got to talk to you about something."
And then she says out loud,
"Jim, I'll talk to you when I'm done talking to Sherry."
I could feel how that was gonna impact him.
And, sure enough, she goes, "I gotta go," andâ€¦
And it was, like, instantaneously, he hit me, bam, bam, bam, threeÂ times, right under my arm.
bam, bam, bam, threeÂ times, right under my arm.
And the fourth one, he stabbed me in my breast.
Blood squirted everywhere.
We get in a fight. We fell to the floor.
[Christy] Someway, we got from the side of the bed onto the floor.
[Christy] Someway, we got from the side of the bed onto the floor. I try to kick him away from me. And when I kicked himâ€¦
[Jim] My leg got cut.
[stammers] I really don't know how that happened, okay?
[Christy] He's taking my head and banging it into the dresser.
Now, I get ahold of the knife handle. My hand slips and cuts me right here.
He stopped everything and just left me laying there
and went to take care of that cut.
I can hear my lung gurgling, so I know that it's filling up with blood.
He keeps walking in and out the room, coming to see if I had died yet.
I was begging him, "Please don't let me die."
I mean, "I'm sorry, Jim. I made a mistake. Truth is, I love you."
But then, by the time I realized he can't let me live,
I was already like, "Fuck you. I've never loved you."
"You've been a piece of shit."
"I've been your personal ATM. You've done nothing but use me."
And then he stands at my feet
with my own pink 9-millimeter.
I told him he didn't have the balls to shoot me.
And he shot me.
Then all of a sudden, my body is dying.
And my mind's like, "No, I don't wanna die."
"I have to get out. I have to save me."
"Someway, I have to save me."
Prayed so hard. "God, please, let me get out of here."
And instantaneously, I heard the shower water turn on.
I knewÂ that was the answer to my prayer
and also the only time I was ever gonna be able to get out.
It was like, you know, the switch flipped.
I ran to the middle of the road.
The first guy went by me,
but then the second guy, Rick Cole, my angel, he stopped.
I said, "Please don't let me die, sir."
And, um, "I'm sorry, but I'm bleeding all over your back seat."
[Christy] He got me to the hospital.
They have a gurney thing out there and put me on.
They have a gurney thing out there and put me on. It all started.
Late breaking tonight, a world-class boxer wanted to get out of her marriage,
then barely made it out of her house.
[newswoman] Christy Martin shot and stabbed and left for dead.
One of my friends texted me, I'm driving, and I almost went off the road.
I was like, "What the--" You know?
[newswoman] Jim Martin shot and stabbed her in theirÂ Apopka home
after she told him she was leaving him for another woman.
The story seemed to grow and grow,
and you were just like, "Oh my God, did I know anything?"
[newsman] Deputies say they're still trying to find 66-year-old James Martin.
[newswoman] They believe he is armed and dangerous.
When I ran from the police, where I went wrong, when I got scared and left,
I shouldÂ never have left. I should've stayed right there.
I slept in a tool shed with lawn mowers.
[Johnny] One night, we went to this fella's place
that was a good friend of Jim that lived right down the street from him.
We smelled Jim's cologne, and we knew he was somewhere close.
[reporter] Deputies found the wanted man holding a bloody knife,
hiding out near this shed behind a vacant home.
If I could've got ahold of him, I'd have killed him right then.
And I wouldn't have made it easy either.
[producer] Did you know that Christy's dad and brother were sort of looking for you
while you were missing? -Did you know that? -Nuh-uh. Mm-mm.
[producer] Why would they do that, do you think?
I don't know.
Well, maybe shoot me since it's their daughter.
[Christy] Sherry actually had called my mom from the hospital
to try to tell her how I was.
She told Sherry that she better not be there when she got there.
You know, here, all these years later, she shows up,
and I get shot and stabbed, and, you know, in my mom's mind,
it was Sherry's fault.
There was no acknowledgment that it was Jim's fault.
That it was her fault and my fault for a month or two.
[Christy] I talked to my mother, and I told her that he had tried to kill me.
And I told my mother she might as well have pulled the trigger.
Becauseâ€¦
I felt like she always took his side.
She would hardly talk to me then, and it wasâ€¦
it was a long time before she did.
[Lisa] I called to talk to Christy, and I'm like,
"Are you okay?"
"Who's Sherry?" [laughs]
One thing's for sure, I didn't creep out of the closet.
I pretty much kicked the door down and said, "I'm here."
The incident caused everything just to go out.
[Laila] I remember hearing the news with her husband trying to kill her
that she was a lesbian.
I remember thinking, "Wow, you never know what someone's going through."
Sometimes we're afraid to be ourselves.
We don't think people accept us or like us.
You know what I mean? We all have that mask of sanity.
We have to be something that the whole community loves.
[Christy] Jim had told me for all those years
[Christy] Jim had told me for all those years how the boxing world would turn against me, fans would turn against me.
It wasâ€¦ It was so much the opposite.
That's what happens all the time. Our fears never happen.
But the fear of it happening causes us to do damage to ourselves.
You know, no one in the boxing community cares that she's gay.
[commentator] Christy Martin here, walking into dangerous territory.
If you can fight like that, you know, big deal.
It's like, "Yeah. Okay, so she's gay."
"What the heck? Her husband tried to kill her?"
Not only being stabbed, but then being sliced,
then being pistol-whipped,
then having your head bashed into a dresser,
and then being shot.
Christy Martin sat silently while the prosecutor described
Christy Martin sat silently while the prosecutor described how she claims to have been viciously attacked
by her 67-year-old husband, Jim.
The trial, which is now set for May in this case,
and Jim Martin's already filed a plea of not guilty.
We look forward to Christy's day in court and to a just result.
I'm a fighter, and I love boxing.
I am determined to go on with my career
and not let what happened to me slow me down.
[Christy] I wanted to get back in the ring,
but more than anything, I wanted to show Jim I could win without him.
[Lisa] Everything that happened,
in every way that Jim Martin ever said he was gonna destroy her,
if she did not come back and fight,
would have been true.
[Jim] I was never jealous of Christy, never whatsoever, 'cause I know what I'd done.
They're looking at my Rembrandt
that I made,
and they're praising it,
and they don't know they're praising me, and I don't care,
but I know she's there 'cause I put her there.
Okay.
One, two.
[Christy] My first call was to Miguel Diaz.
Miguel Diaz is my cutman.
He always laughs andÂ says, "Make sure everybody knows
I wasn't in your corner the night of the Gogarty fight."
But Miguel is mi papi. I love him.
But Miguel is mi papi. I love him. And I just asked him, um,
would he train me?
I said, "Are you sure? You think you're gonna be okay for fighting?"
She say, "I just wanna know if you will train me."
And that's when I say, "Yeah, absolutely,"
thinking that maybe this is gonna be five months from now, six months from now.
But, like, within 24 hours, I was in the boxing gym,
bullet still in my back.
[Jimmy] I was down for it. "Let's get that 50th win."
-Again, I know her heart. -There we go.
[Jimmy] She fights to win.
[Miguel] It's very hard for fighters to understand when is the finish of their career,
because inside their brains,
they're still fighting to the last point.
It's the only thing they know what to do.
Once we get in that ring and those people start applauding us,
we're addicted. We're hooked.
No drug is gonna replace that feeling. I can't even explain that feeling to you, and you don't wanna let it go.
I can't even explain that feeling to you, and you don't wanna let it go.
It was so hard to give support,
and, to me, not just demand the right thing be done,
and that's not fight.
She didn't like Christy Martin. She wanted me to be just Christy Salters.
Well, I-I'm not.
You tell me I can't do something, then sit back and watch.
If you tell me I can't do it, I'm gonna do it or die.
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, continuing now at the Staples Center
with a very special attraction,
scheduled for six two-minute rounds,
featuring the women of boxing.
[Johnny] She just wasn't gonna stop.
And there wasn't gonna be no stopping her.
[announcer] Introducing first, fighting out of the blue corner,
from Auburn, Washington,
here is Dakota "Solid" Stone!
-[bell dings] -Out of the red corner,
tonight, she looks for win number 50,
from Bluefield, West Virginia,
Christy Martin! -[bell dings] -[crowd cheering]
First round, we're exchanging good exchanges.
[commentator] There's that right hand! Right on the mark! Right on--
Christy Martin, in my book, got that win.
She was doing good.
[commentator] Oh, big shot by Christy Martin.
I was telling Christy, "Use the jab a bit. Don't go crazy."
[commentator] Always a crowd-pleaser, Christy Martin.
But, for Christy, it's almost impossible to give those kind of instructions.
[commentator] And again, the reach advantage. It is a four--
Good right hand by Christy Martin, on the button!
It looks like she might have hurt her hand.
She needs to get under that jab, then push her off that--
Oh! Good right hand!
Big one!Â Big one!
I knock her down. First time she's ever been knocked down in her career.
[commentator] What aÂ right hook by Christy Martin, set up beautifully.
But I broke my hand.
That's the worst thing you can do, throw the right hand over right hand,
on top of the head.
Time.
[commentator] That was a 10-8 round for Christy Martin.
[Miguel] The referee come and say, "How is she?"
"It's okay. She's all right. She's-- No problem."
"The last two rounds, we're gonna be jabbing. Don't worry."
-[commentator 1] That right handâ€¦ -[commentator 2] She did hurt her hand.
The only time I could say I actually felt pain in the boxing ring
The only time I could say I actually felt pain in the boxing ring was when I broke my hand,
but, um, it wasn't painful enough for me to stop.
So I still was able to throw that broken hand.
[commentator 1] She's scoring points. She's working with one hand.
I was winning the fight easily, had knocked down Dakota Stone,
ahead by at least three points on all cards.
Fifty seconds to go.
-[commentator 1] She hurt her hand again! -[commentator 2] Yes, she did.
[commentator 1] She landed the right hand.
She hit it and went like that.
The doctor says, "You're not throwing it. You winced when you did throw it once."
I'm pleading with him. "I'm not even getting hit. I'm winning the rounds."
"I'm not even getting hit. I'm winning the rounds." Fifty seconds from my fiftieth win.
-I don't care. I have to finish. -[commentators] She wants to continue.
-Please, let me finish. -[commentator 1] She wants to continue.
I'm calling it off. It's over. I'm sorry.
[commentator 1] David Mendoza saying it's over!
And, um, he waved it off.
Fucking doctor come in and tell everybody to stop the fight.
[commentator 1] She's kicked her mouthpiece. She's not able to continue.
[commentator 2] If she wouldn't have thrown that right--
She was winning the fight, dropped her opponent,
and she was ahead.
And I was like,
"How? How?"
Ladies and gentlemen, after consulting with the ringside physician,
referee David Mendoza has to stop this contest
due to a broken right hand sustained byÂ Christy Martin.
Therefore, the winner by TKO victory,
Dakota "Solid" Stone.
The doctor said, "Christy, remember you spoke
The doctor said, "Christy, remember you spoke at our physicians' ringside conference a few years ago,
and you said ringside physicians have to protect fighters from themselves."
And I said, "Fuck you. I wasn't talking about me."
[Sherry] Her hand was literally gravel. I mean, the doctor said that's the worst broken hand she'd ever seen.
I mean, the doctor said that's the worst broken hand she'd ever seen.
[Christy] The doctors told my family surgery would take about two hours
and I would be out.
Um, surgery took seven hours.
When I finally woke up,
like, I knew that something was wrong.
Iâ€¦ I couldn't walk. I-I couldn't talk. Umâ€¦
My vision was really messed up.
And I look at her and immediately go, "She's had a stroke."
Six months after being shot and stabbed.
[Christy] With Sherry, we had decided before the stroke
that she was gonna go her separate way.
We wereâ€¦ We were gonna break up.
We just were different people.
Uh, it just wasn't gonna work.
And you know what? She could have left.
That wasâ€¦ That was the agreement. But she didn't. She stayed there.
But she didn't. She stayed there. She took care of me and helped me get through the stroke,
and she gave me a lot of support in the courtroom.
[newswoman] Christy Martin entered the courtroom prepared for what's been described as the fight of her life.
It's he said, she said, and you know what?
It's not who's right and wrong.
It's who can tell the best story.
[newswoman] Martin claims his boxer wife was the aggressor.
Yes, I talked to his attorney, and that will be their defense.
I was just trying to defend myself. I wasn't even trying to hurt her.
[newswoman] Jim Martin's attorney painted a picture of confusion.
That cocaine made her paranoid. The gun belonged to Christy.
At that point in time,
Christy Martin felt threatened,
her life felt threatened,
and her career felt threatened.
He would look out the corner of his eye to see who was back there.
I just wanted to run up there and beat him.
Christy and I said the whole time leading up to the trial, "Let's get him."
[reporter] Christy Martin laid it all out for the jury,
the good, the bad, and the ugly.
The jury saw the bloody T-shirt Christy used to try to stop the bleeding.
The clothes she wore, complete with knife holes.
Christy said Jim walked into the room a second time
with her pink 9-millimeter gun.
The whole time, I looked straight at Jim. When he would try to look away from me, I would tell him to look at me.
When he would try to look away from me, I would tell him to look at me.
I wasn't about to let him see me cry.
It's time for me to stand on my own. It's time for me to show him that I'm strong.
You shot me with my own gun,
basically point-blank.
And guess what, mother****?
I walked out. I walked out.
I've come to some realization that I got my 50th win when I got up off the floor,
November 23, 2010.
That was not just my 50th win, but that was the biggest win of my life.
[judge] If Madam Clerk would please publish our verdict.
[clerk] Yes, Your Honor.
Count one.
We, the jury, find the defendant guilty of attempted second-degree murder.
[newsman] The jury convicted on attempted second degree in one count
and attempted manslaughter on the other.
[Jim] When they announced my sentence, I didn'tÂ flinch.
It says in the paper I didn't flinch.
I wasn't gonna show any, umâ€¦
weakness.
You know?
She's the worst thing that ever happened in my life if you would look at where I'm at.
But I lived a pretty good life.
And I was happy.
You know.
Well, it was my choice.
I done what I said I would do.
I said, "Christy, I'm gonna make you the best woman athlete in the world."
It's probably the only thing I ever said in my life to come true.
[newsman] Jim Martin faces a minimum of 25 years in prison. His attorney will appeal.
You know, in 25 years, if he lives to be 92, he'll get out.
And honestly,
he's such a son of a bitch, I think he will live to be 92.
If he lives long enough, he'll get out.
And if I live long enough, he won't never walk nowhere.
[Christy] I have a recurring dream that happens here in my granny's house.
And Jim's chasing me,
and chasing me all around the house,
and trying every way I can to get away from him,
so heâ€¦ he can't stab me.
I-I guess I wake up before anything happens every time,
but it's this same dreamâ€¦ I've been having the same dream for nine years.
Here.
Again, Iâ€¦ Why this house,
why I keep having the dream, you know, I don't have an answer for.
I talk to my counselor about that all the time,
like, "When am I gonna get over it?"
And, umâ€¦
she says, "Probably never, Christy."
"This isâ€¦ You have to figure out how to deal with it."
And so, that's what I do. And, I mean, I-I'm getting better.
I mean, we're coming up on, uh, nine years.
I-I-- I'm gonna be okay. I am okay.
I'm not gonna be okay. I am okay.
[Christy] Thank you for coming. Thank you for being part of Christy Martin Promotions.
I truly appreciate it.
It means a lot to have guys like you come in here to fight on my show.
[Christy] Finally, I got to the point in my life where I'm gonna be me.
It's kinda like this.
You can either get on or you can get off. It doesn't matter.
I really don't care anymore.
And then out of nowhere, here comes Lisa Holewyne.
I don't really know what happened, what change, what directionallyâ€¦ [laughs]
The world tilted on its axis?
I'm not really sure.
I don'tâ€¦ I don't know. I think everything came together at the right moment,
and we realized we were a good match.
[Christy] I-I love her without question,
and, um, I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life.
I'm happy in my own skin.
[Lisa] It feels great to have a wife that isÂ Christy.
She's everything thatâ€¦
makes things right by me.
So what I want is for her to feel full of love and life
and the possibilities of everything else
and not that she's just a fighter.
And I think that she was a fighter and a meal ticket for other people.
I hope it's everlasting, and that, umâ€¦
I just hope I can make her as happy as she makes me.
It was very important that Lisa stay here with me this week
to hear my true story
and to see how hard it is.
-It's New York City. -[car horn honking]
Street basketball.
This is our culture.
This is what we do, B.
This is our job.
Yo, back in the day, it was like a big block party.
[man] The atmosphere, the energy. It was just special.
[announcer] It's jam-packed out here.
The players are putting on a show, and the crowds are loving it.
[man] But AND1, they just took it to another level.
[announcer] AND1 basketball is sweeping the nation,
becoming one of the biggest basketball brands.
[man] Tokyo, Japan. Venezuela. Brazil.
You know, it was pandemonium.
[announcer] The competition is heating up.
AND1's newest sneakers are jumping off the shelves.
[reporter] The line is not down the block. It is the block.
[man] AND1? They had the best ballplayers in street basketball.
And the best players get the best names. Like Skip 2 My Lou.
The Main Event.
[announcer] The Main Event!
[man] Shane. The Dribbling Machine.
[announcer] Get your Superman on, Shane!
[man] We talking about Hot to the Sauce.
We talking about The Professor.
[reporter] AND1 is taking on the titans of the industry
with no plans of backing down.
[man] A lot of people today say, "Whatever happened to AND1?"
I don't know what happened to it. And I was a part of it.
[man] I could never have started a business without my education at Wharton,
but after, like, the second day there,
a couple things became pretty evident to me.
All my classmates were totally focused on what they wanted to do,
and I had no idea.
I had probably spent four to eight hours hooping
for every hour that I spent studying.
[Seth] That summer, I did a free internship in investment banking.
I was like, "This sucks. I'm not doing this." "I wanna do something that I love."
"If every day I get to wake up thinking about basketball,
that will be a great day."
That was the genesis to go start my own business.
I know the limitations of my abilities.
I was like, "There's no shot I can do this by myself."
"I gotta find a partner."
[man] Seth and I met each other in seventh grade.
He came to me in college with this idea. So I said, "Yes,"
He came to me in college with this idea. So I said, "Yes," 'cause it'll be a lot more fun to do any business with your best friend.
Seth talked about this young guy that he met while he was playing ball
and that I had to meet Tom.
[Seth] When you play ball with somebody, you learn a lot about them really quickly.
Tom has a 3.96 GPA at Wharton undergrad.
I'm like, "How's that possible?"
"Like, the dude's playing basketball seven hours a day."
And he said, "Just so you're aware, Tom's kind of a strange cat."
He's, like, you know, looking down, not making eye contact, talking real low.
But Tom was brilliant. And he was really the genius behind AND1.
[Tom] I grew up in small towns in New England. We moved, like, three times.
I was a shy, quiet kid,
and basketball was the thing that let me connect with people.
[Seth] So, I talked to Tom, and I'm like,
"Yo, man. Um, you might be interested in pursuing a basketball business?" "What are you doing next year?"
[Tom] I had no professional skills.
I had only held very low jobs. You know, dishwasher, busboy.
So when I heard they were working on a basketball startup,
that was a lifeline for me, right?
'Cause I just wanted to stay connected to the game,
and I wanted to wear shorts to work. [laughs]
[Jay] We had the meeting at a pizza parlor,
and we were trying to figure out what's the identity of the brand that we would bring.
When you make a bucket, and you get fouled,
'cause you know the basket is going in, you say, "And one."
You don't say, "And one," you scream, "And one."
-That's the ultimate way to talk shit. -It's like, "And one, motherfucker!"
[Tom] And then I had this idea. We can put trash talking on a T-shirt.
So I wrote up 30 slogans, and I was like, "This is our first shirt."
"I'm sorry I thought you could play."
"I'm the bus driver. I take everyone to school."
"Wear a collar. You just got dogged."
Probably the most famous one, which is, "Your game is as ugly as your girl."
[Tom] There were, like, six more, and they were all like the very first time I sat down to write trash talk.
and they were all like the very first time I sat down to write trash talk.
But it was really the culmination of 15 years of playing all the time.
[Tom] So when we started with AND1, we didn't know how merchandising worked,
how retail worked. We didn't know anything.
So we were creating our own culture, and sometimes that was a beautiful thing,
and sometimes it was Lord of the Flies.
Two Wharton degrees and a Stanford degree,
and we're selling T-shirts out of the back of a hatchback.
The first year we lost money.
But I remember the feeling of someone saying,
"I wanna pay you for your shirts." I was like, "Wow."
And people loved the trash-talking shirts.
So we felt like, you know, we might have something here.
And then we ended up getting an order for three or four styles from Foot Locker.
Holy cow. We just got a $13,000 order.
The other stores see kids walking around with our shirts, and they're calling us.
For the first time, we're not calling people.
-[ringing] -People are calling us.
Okay. We got something here. Like, this is gonna go.
Turning into some big business for a T-shirt company.
This kind of fashion, not the kind of thing you see every day, but they're on to something.
Come on. We wanna do it, don't we?
Well, I was looking forward to playing basketball,
but I guess that's out the window.
You want some of me--
[Tom] Within that first year, we ended up doing about 1.6 million in sales.
Then the challenge becomes, "Okay. What's next though?"
We knew we wanted to be a billion-dollar company.
So from day one, we were competing with only one brand.
Just do it!
Nike was a company we emulated the most. And they associate themselves with great talent.
Here we have the, uh, the new, improved Air Jordan.
We want to make the number one basketball brand in the world.
We can't do that unless we do shoes.
[Tom] That's where the money was at,
and Nike had that whole market on lockdown.
[reporter 1] High-tech shoes and slick ads get more and more sophisticated.
Nike is just doing it. [reporter 2] Fourth-quarter profits improves to 126 million dollars.
[reporter 2] Fourth-quarter profits improves to 126 million dollars.
[man] When you bring the right athlete with the right advertising,
it creates a very strong situation in the marketplace.
So now, we need to go and get our own Michael Jordan.
We couldn't start with B-level guys.
If we're gonna do this, we need to go get an A-level guy.
-[announcer] Marbury behind the back toâ€¦ -[whistle blows]
There's no "ifs" for Stephon Marbury from Georgia Tech.
He says he's ready to move on and rub shoulders with Magic and Michael.
Everyone in basketball knew Steph. He was an electric basketball player.
With the fourth pick in the 1996 NBA Draft,
the Milwaukee Bucks selectÂ Stephon Marbury from Georgia Tech University.
[reporter] This man is a can't miss.
[Seth] We effectively bet the company on Steph.
We said, "We want you to be a ten-year endorsement deal,"
which is unheard of for a kid who had never played a minute
which is unheard of for a kid who had never played a minute of professional basketball.
[announcer] From Georgia Tech, number 3, Stephon Marbury!
[Jay] For opening night, myself and Seth are literally courtside,
and we're so excited.
The shoes are hitting the water, coming into Foot Locker.
The TV ads are running.
Who knew that all we'd been building was gonna go up in smoke that night.
I can still see it. Steph goes up, and I'm like, "uh-oh."
[announcer] Oh my goodness.
I just broke out in a cold sweat seeing that.
Our faces are white.
[Seth] Oh my God. We just ran a "breaking ankles" TV campaign
for Stephon Marbury.
And Stephon just broke his ankle wearing our shoes.
A week before the shoes are supposed to hit.
[announcer] Stephon Marbury being helped off the floorâ€¦
[Stephon] I usually recover real quickly, but being that this is a bit more severe,
I'm really hurting, you know, knowing that I can't play.
[Jay] And so, we're in the tunnel, and we seeÂ Steph's agent looking at us with just, like, daggers in his eyes.
and we seeÂ Steph's agent looking at us with just, like, daggers in his eyes.
[Seth] Someone on his team says,
"I might haveÂ Stephon go on national TV and dump your shoes in the garbage can."
And I literally just said, "Bro, it's been real, but I think we're done."
And I literally just said, "Bro, it's been real, but I think we're done." "I can't figure out any way we're not gonna go broke right here."
[Jay] We wanted to play the endorsement game, wanted to out-Nike Nike, and we failed.
Two weeks later, we got this tape. It had been around our office.
There were a couple of interns, and they were always watching it.
[Jay] The video blew our minds.
[Seth] I was like, "Holy shit."
I've seen a lot of basketball.
[chuckling] I've never seen this before.
[Tom] And in this game was 15-year-old Rafer Alston,
who was called "Skip 2 My Lou."
[announcer] Show some love for my homeboy,
Skip 2 My Lou!
[Skip 2 My Lou] New York streetball style, it's a style where you just let your imagination flow.
[Skip 2 My Lou] It was more poetry in motion.
It was more trickery and sorcery.
I always wanted to deceive you.
A third of what he's doing is illegal right here.
But I don't really think it matters because it's so unique.
Streetball is hip-hop,
graffiti, breakdancing,
all-in-one.
And the crowd is our music.
Winning has nothing to do with streetball.
[Skip 2 My Lou] Your team, they could lose, but if you've electrified the crowd,
they were satisfied. [chuckling]
[The Main Event] The court is the canvas.
The style of play that you have is your ink.
And the player that you is is the artist.
A lot of us come up through the inner city in single-parent homes.
[The Dribbling Machine] My mom had me when she was 15.
I grew up in one of the biggest projects in the Bronx.
I never really had a steady home to practice my skills.
It wasn't about sports, it was about survival.
The first time I touched a basketball, I probably was maybe 11, 12?
Just didn't really have the basketball skills or basketball IQ.
But my dad would take me out to different parks,
and that's where I honed a lot of my skills.
Streetball, it's a way of life here.
[The Dribbling Machine] It wasn't about money. Because that was the NBA.
[announcer] Swish picks up Dumars, who lets it fly, and he hits it again for three!
[The Main Event] Where we came from,
a lot of people don't have that type of money
to go see an NBA game at the Madison Square Garden.
So for us, Rucker was the main stage in New York City.
Streetball was born there.
When they first took me to watch a game, I was little and skinny.
I made my way to the front, and I just sat right there on the court.
I'm watching my idols play.
Pee Wee Kirkland, Joe Hammond, Earl Manigault,
Dr. J.
People that were seven, eight blocks away, you could hear them.
You knew where everyone was at.
Most people at some point realized,
"I might not make D1. I might not make the NBA."
But you can still go play at the playground.
So I realized what's on this tape.
It's just pure, like, self-expression.
And that's when I started to understand this is the essence of who we are.
We're playground.
We're grassroots. We're everyman basketball.
We're attitude, we're raw expression, we're art.
And this is a strategic position that Nike can't touch.
[reporter] We interrupt this program to bring you the following Special Report.
[anchor] Good morning and thank you for joining us.
It's the day Bulls fans around the world have been dreading for years.
Michael Jordan is scheduled to make a big announcement
at the United Center any minute now.
I am here toâ€¦ to announce my retirement from the game of basketball.
[Jay] Now, all of a sudden, with Jordan being out
and there being no games on because of the NBA lockout,
there was a void in the basketball market.
There was this opportunity for new content that didn't exist before.
[Jay] As a business, how can we take that experience of a streetball game at theÂ Rucker
how can we take that experience of a streetball game at theÂ Rucker
and make it something that actually fills that void?
One of the young guys that we had hired to do product placement in New York,
a guy named Set Free, who was a DJ, producer, hip-hop artist.
He says, "We should make that a mixtape and just give it away."
It ended up being this collection of footage plus unreleased music.
This is Sway from theÂ World Famous Wake Up Show,
and y'all are about to view the AND1 Mixtape on video.
Coming to you live. Keep it banging!
AND1 pressed 50,000 old-school VHS tapes.
We gave away through the street teams, clubs, courts, neighborhood barbershops.
And it was like the new crack. It went rampant in the inner city.
[Tom] Each person sharing it with another dozen or two dozen or three dozen people.
We had this insane viral marketing in theÂ pre-internet age. [chuckling]
After Mixtape came out, I was like a hero in New York City.
Before I know it, I have 20 people walking behind me.
"Oh man, Skip. I wanna walk with you. Can I walk inside the park with you?"
[Sway] Look out for Volume 2, y'all! AND1 Mixtape!
By Monday, we had calls coming in from people who had lost their minds.
We all gathered around the phone, just listening to all these messages.
-[beeps] -[man] Yo, that mixtape was sick.
[man 2] Killed it, AND1!
[man 3] Skip 2 My Lou!
[man 4] Hold on.
[man 5] Need another one, please!
-[man 6] Where is Volume 2? -[beeps]
Immediately the question was, "How do we do another one?"
So we created the idea for the AND1 Mixtape Tour.
We're gonna put together the best playground pickup basketball team we can.
Get your best five, and we have our best five
and let's put on a game.
But let's not just do it one time in New York.
Let's start going city to city.
[man] I was brought on at AND1 as a tour manager and headed up Player Relations.
The idea was, "Hey. We're just gonna do this five-city tour."
Really to get content for more mixtapes.
[announcer] Shane!
[The Main Event] I just got kicked out of Rutgers University 'cause of my grades.
Now I'm back at home. My son was four or five. You know, I needed a job.
[The Main Event] I get a call from AND1.
"Yo, you think you'll pull a game off in your hometown?"
First phone call I made was Shane.
[The Dribbling Machine]Â Playing streetball, butÂ it's in my thirties,
and the NBA was far-fetched for me.
I'll never forget.
I'm standing on the corner, and Main calls me.
And it was going through one end out the other end.
The only thing that really caught my attention was,
"AND1's gonna give us free sneakers,
free shorts to bust some dude's ass? Let's do it."
[Duke] Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. My name is Duke Tango.
And sit back and relax because this is how we roll.
Duke Tango's the godfather announcer of streetball.
If Duke Tango gave you your name,
he's solidifying who you are as that streetballer.
Main said, "Yo, would you like to be involved with this?"
And I looked at him like, "Who would say no to that?"
When you see that crowd around the corner,
and then you walk into that park and see thousands of people?
Ain't no way in the world you can be prepared for that.
Well, I say, "Yo, Main and Shane,
let's go to Philadelphia and get AO."
"Let's get this Headache."
Then I got Black Widow,
and Half Man Half Amazing.
And so, AND1 did the first-ever contracts with streetball players.
[Tom] The first stop is Linden, New Jersey.
We brought the camera crew to film both crowd and game.
I don't even think I really knew what filmmaking was back then.
I just knew I had a camera in my hand,
and I'm bringing the audience with me.
I just tried to capture everything
that I felt and everything that I saw because it was unbelievable.
[The Main Event] This is Chris Hightower's itinerary.
-[Gee Lock] This is a Hightower original? -Official.
[Chris] When I went on tour. they gave me a corporate car,
six grand in cash, and was like, "Make it work."
[The Dribbling Machine] We stayed in shit hotels. We shared rooms.
We're playing in front of a crowd of 100 people.
And now I'm in a minivan
sitting in the chair from the house that's sliding all over in the van.
[Chris] We were our own street team.
Boxes of tapes,
we're passing them out, passing out flyers,
trying to do every and anything we could to get people to the event.
We didn't know where it was gonna go. There was no blueprint.
And it was really just all about having a platform
for players like ourselves, who didn't make it to the NBA,
to get paid to play.
[Jay] So every year we go to one of those big trade shows.
We're running these videos outside of our booth.
There's a massive crowd, and they're coming to watch Volume 2.
We knew at that moment that there was something here
that could be much bigger than we thought, much faster than we thought.
Hot 97.5 ATL's original hip-hop and R&B station,
I got the AND1 all-stars. I mean, y'all seen the mixtape.
You seen them balling out of control.
They gonna be doing their thing today. Go check them out.
[man] It's going down from 4:30 to 6:00.
If you wanna become the next streetball player,
come on down, this is your opportunity.
[The Dribbling Machine] When we played in Atlanta, that atmosphere was totally different.
[crowd] Hot Sauce! Hot Sauce!
I canÂ hear the crowd. The crowd is saying, "Hot Sauce."
[The Dribbling Machine] Yo, like, who is Hot Sauce?
[Hot Sauce] I used to play in the hoods in Georgia,
stealing balls out of other people's yards. [man] Guess you had to put on them new shoes? Boy, I'll tell youâ€¦
I had a job, but I never could keep a job.
My nine-to-five was just working on my handles.
I was already a local legend.
Every day I played, people just circled around the court.
[Hot Sauce] After seeing Mixtape 1 and Mixtape 2,
I was hungry to be on the tapes.
But I didn't know whatâ€¦ what it would take.
That's when I heard that they decided to take the tour to Atlanta.
That's when my opportunity came.
I was in jail, you know, doing some of this knucklehead teenage stuff.
But the day I got out of jail, the next day was a tour game.
It was like, "Yo. What is this?"
[Skip 2 My Lou] A lot of us are like, "What is he doing?"
It wasâ€¦ It was amazing.
When Hot Sauce did thatâ€¦
Oh baby!
That was it.
One man took the idea of streetball,
and he just flipped it.
The flair and his image,
it forever changed the game.
[Jay] Volume 3 became "The Hot Sauce" tape.
We got the new star. It's done. This is all about this kid Hot Sauce.
So we signed him.
[Gee Lock] From the first game on,
he was like an icon.
[Gee Lock] Once he came on the tour,
it was a whole nother animal.
[chuckling] You know what I'm saying? Like, no more minivans.
It was three-million-dollar tour buses decked out.
-Hot Sauce! -Hot Sauce! What's up, boy?
Look, it's the Sauce world now. It's my show.
My favorite is Hot Sauce.
Hot Sauce is number one.
I like Hot Sauce. He my boy.
Hot Sauce was the guy that everyone wanted to see.
Not just the inner-city youth,
but even the kids in the suburbs watching his tape.
-He's crazy! -[man 1] I know.
[man 2] Oh my God!
They were studying his moves.
-[The Dribbling Machine] Y2K. -[The Main Event] Y2K.
[The Dribbling Machine] The Flintstone.
The Boomerang. [announcer] Come on, Hot Sauce!
Then you see people on the court trying to figure out,
"How did he do that?" And then doing it themselves.
[man] I was the kid that would watch the Mixtapes over and over and over.
I could do a move, but it wouldn't quite be like Hot Sauce, you know?
The way he handled the basketball was so unique and innovative.
This guy, like, moves the crowd.
I wanted to captivate the crowd like Hot Sauce. -[hip-hop music playing] -[indistinct chatter]
At that time, I might've been the most popular basketball player on Earth.
We got the AND1 streetballers.
They're gonna strut their stuff out on the stage.
Let's start it out with Hot Sauce.
-You got a movie coming out in September. -That was a great experience, right there.
As a business, we hadn't really tied the Mixtape to sales.
But when we did Volume 3, The Rise of Hot Sauce,
we partnered with Footaction.
The idea was you have to buy any AND1 product,
and we're gonna give away a free Mixtape.
We have kids from the street. They have a lot of fun.
And everyâ€¦ every, uh, consumer that we talk to connects with them.
I'm at some store buying some things, and I'm like, "Yo, that's me right there."
Everywhere I go, I see our faces with our names.
[man] AND1 is hot right now. Really hot.
These last two weeks, sales have really been bumping.
And that was the first time I remember Nike paying attention.
We got, like, three people, and we're taking on Goliath.
And when we started to out-compete,
we knew we were gonna be a legitimate threat.
[Seth] I'll never forget.
Someone sent me a video from Nike's sales meeting.
They had a picture of AND1 in the crosshairs.
So it was like, "Got it. Nike took dead aim at us."
We were just consistent a top-two performing brand.
And we had the mixtape tour. They didn't have anything like that.
That's like the heart of the game, and we owned the heart of the game.
If you're Nike, you're risk-averse.
They don't wanna offend a 50-year-old guy in middle America,
and they sell to a broad audience. That's not who we are.
We're selling to core people who are basketball players and know it.
We knew that Nike felt they had to respond.
And we had no idea what they were gonna do.
We got it. Let's roll sound.
[woman] Camera speeds.
We are at the ESPN building in the "N-1" Mixtape Tour.
You know what that means? They don't know us.
In 2003, ESPN came to us
and said they wanted to do a TV show based around the tour.
Kind of like when reality TV was growing up.
[Chris] The basis of the ESPN show was to find that next guy.
Who's that next level of talent?
[Tom] It's basically like Survivor.
We'll go to Portland, Atlanta, Seattle.
And the winner, the survivor, the ultimate pick,
is someone who gets an AND1 contract.
Well, another unique event is returning to the capital city.
The AND1 Mixtape Tour team is a collection of basketball characters
with nicknames and hip-hop playing hoops.
If you think you can run with these guys, show up tomorrow from 4:00 to 6:30.
They're looking for a few extra players to play.
[Chris] We were always looking for new talent, but no one stood out.
There wasn't much streetball where I'm from in Keizer, Oregon.
It was looked down upon.
Coaches, they didn't really respect that style of play.
[Grayson] Growing up, I wasn't really as into the NBA.
I liked watching AND1.
And then I got to high school. I was really small.
I kept getting cut from teams.
I had no college offers.
That was one of the biggest heartbreaks.
It wasn't a girlfriend or anything like that.
And I just decided to do something innovative
away from conventional basketball. Away from the NBA.
Slam Magazine released the routing of the tour.
I saw that Portland was on there.
So I put all that energy into training,
and I knew that this was my shot.
[Grayson] When I first got up there to open run tryouts,
I had never seen people all around the court.
Kids and people standing on the fences to get a better view.
Might be nerve-wracking with the tryout.
[man] We gotta pick three people.
We have to pick three people
to make it to play inside the arena!
When my shot came up, I wasn't even thinking about passing.
[announcer] Okay. Let me see them feet.
[Grayson] A lot of moves I pulled off, people were like losing their minds.
Right here, my man in the blue.
I'm just excited to play with Hot Sauce. All these dudes I've seen on tape.
I see them in real life, it's almost likeâ€¦ it's just like a dream, you know?
Stepping inside the arena was so awesome.
And I'm like, "Man, we're here." Likeâ€¦ [chuckling] "We made it!"
So that first game playing against my idols was very surreal.
Crowd went crazy over a few moves. They respected that I didn't back down.
[The Main Event] I made the overall pick.
Gotta go with you.
[Grayson] So they asked me to come on tour with them
as a contestant in this nationwide contest.
It kind of blew me away.
I'm thinking my parents wouldn't let me, but they were like,Â "Go ahead and do it."
Going into the tour,
I knew that with every city, I definitely had a chance to go home.
Because at every open run, a new player could knock somebody out.
So somebody was always coming, and somebody was always going.
[Headache] He's the first one, and the first one's always the hardest
'cause we got 29 more cities.
-Yeah. I'm at a disadvantage, huh? -Yeah.
For me, coming in there at 18, I actually felt like a kid amongst adults.
Sometimes you have, like, 14, 15 people on the bench,
and you just try to make the best with the time you got.
[Duke] I said, "Yo, you know what? A white boy on this team?"
"That's gonna be my godson. I'mma adopt him."
I gave him his name as soon as I seen him.
That's my boy, my godson,
the Rocky Balboa of basketball,
The Professor!
Anything a talented white boy could do in the hood
is amplified a million times.
But Professor is the real deal.
One of these three guys right here will be sent home tonight.
Every elimination game, magic would happen.
[Duke] Godson! The Professor! Putting it up! Oh yeah!
-Professor, I'll see you in Dallas. -Okay.
-All right? Be good. -All right.
It's a little bit of pressure, but that's what it's about.
'Cause this contract will change somebody's life.
What's up, man?
-[Gee Lock] Professor, you going home? -No. I ain't going nowhere.
I'm justâ€¦ Go out there. Do my thing.
I'm just gonna keep doing what I've done every game that's got me to this point.
[Duke] Yeah. Look at the hold on Headache.
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, baby!
[The Professor] The last stop was Linden, New Jersey.
This court right here is basically the genesis. This is where it started.
Go ahead and play to 21.
Then after that, the team's gonna get together.
We're gonna make a decision.
[The Professor] It was AND1 players and the contestants going against each other.
You can do it on the commercial circuit, but can you do it in the hood?
Can you do it playing against us?
Even to start that game, like, Sik Wit It got me crazy on some fake pass.
I mean, I was like, "Dang." Like, I know I'm definitely behind now.
And then a couple plays later, I'd block a shot.
Hit some shots.
Played really well, but so did the other guys.
[Duke] Professor. Hot Sauce. Hot Sauce. Professor.
-[Duke] That's the game! -[man] That's it!
When they go to the final vote, I didn't think I would get the votes.
[Half Man Half Amazing] I wanna tell y'all congratulations
that the man to get this contract is gonna beâ€¦
El Professor.
-Okay? -Thanks, man.
[Half Man Half Amazing] Gonna be that man.
I couldn't believe it. It was a dream come true.
I had put in all this hard work, and now I'm an AND1 streetballer.
Checking out the first episode. Looks pretty good.
[Seth] When the TV show on ESPN came out,
I wasn't, quite frankly, even sure if people would watch.
[reporter] Yo, the line is not down the block. It is the block.
Like, open up the door, bam!
Shane, Shane, Shane! Man, man, man!
Wow. This is something. People were going crazy.
We out here, mad love. Mad love out here.
-Give me your headband! Give me something! -Give me your do-rag!
The AND1 Mixtape Tour is coming to town this weekend.
-[anchor] Who's that guy, The Professor? -[anchor 2] Isn't he something?
The fanfare was surreal because it happened for me overnight.
Thank you, sweetie! [laughing]
America loves this kid. The ratings is going out of this world.
[Gee Lock] After being with the AND1 tour,
he had cornrows like a black dude. He had the diamond studs in.
Before the game, he was talking like Opie. After the game, he was Eminem.
It turned into the Jackson Five. That's Michael Jackson.
I love you, Professor!
He's only 11.
I remember his first groupie.
I knew that would change his life.
Hold on.
I was a really shy kid in high school, but I definitely embraced it, you know?
The ESPN show, it just put us out there on a whole nother level.
[The Dribbling Machine] NBA players and celebrities, they was loving it.
In case you didn't see that move, rewind it back.
AND1 Mixtape Tour! I love this game!
At that point, we started to charge money for people to come to a game,
and we were selling out NBA venues.
[Skip 2 My Lou] A couple of arenas we went to,
we had more fans in that arena than they had for their own home team.
[The Dribbling Machine] I'll never forget.
We're in the club, and I see the Detroit Pistons
just won their second NBA championship,
and I'm telling the DJ, "Yo, Chauncey Billups is here."
[commentator] Chauncey Billups, a likely candidate for the MVP Award.
And then the DJ looked at me and says, "Man, fuck them. Y'all here."
[Duke] You know about it. You heard about it.
Now we're taking it to the next level. Now it's time to take it across the water.
This is a global invasion.
Our first international tour, I mean, it was shocking.
It was actually bigger than the United States. Like, actually way bigger.
-Make some noise, Tokyo! -[crowd roars]
[Skip 2 My Lou] This is the AND1 Mixtape Tour.
Right now, Australian zoo. Me and my homie the koala right now.
Now, everything was first class. We're staying in the Ritz-Carlton.
These guys was rock star shit.
[Gee Lock] So, dudes used to go to the autographs
'cause chicks was gonna fucking swarm.
[speaking indistinctly] Go to Hot Sauce.
I love him.
[woman] AND1, baby.
[The Dribbling Machine] We had guys come up with their wives.
There's nothing to sign, and she pulls her titty out,
and it's like, "You want me to sign your wife's titty?"
AND1 tour? We're partying, drinking, smoking.
[Gee Lock] They had a camera. They be like, "Yo. We got the night cam."
And I'm like, "What y'all looking at?"
It was all of them having a massive orgy with some bad chick!
I was like, "Yo! I seen her at the game!"
"Damn!" [laughing]
[chuckling] He lying. No, just-- [laughing]
He just joking again.
The AND1 groove, it was so fast that nobody could stop us.
The AND1 Mixtape Tour, presented by Mountain Dew.
[Jay] Now we've got sponsors coming in.
Took it from the streets, to the arenas, to video games.
[Seth] My team showed me a stat one day
that Streetball was the number one male-rated TV show on ESPN.
I'm like, "Fuck you, man. Like, stop."
And they said, "Streetball is the number one TV show
for male teens on ESPN."
I was like, "Holy F."
[man] What's up?
With the Mixtape Tour becoming a huge breakout successâ€¦
We went from 15 to 70 people within a two or three-year period.
We made a decision for a long-term space.
So, the office had to have a basketball court.
[Jay] Now we're a big national brand, how do we expand our footprint?
So we decided we're gonna take one more shot on shoes.
[Jay] The first Marbury shoe was ugly, heavy, overpriced.
And that problem lied with me,
as the person who was overseeing that product.
I was always giving Jay notes, like,
"Hey, Jay, you should do this. Jay, you should do that."
And Jay's like, "Tom, I am sick of you telling me the stuff you could do."
"Do you wanna give it a shot?"
I was maybe 25, and I was like, "Yeah." Like, I didn't have a doubt.
I had a really clear idea of what a basketball shoe should be.
Shoes should be light. They should be fast.
They should be airy, like running shoes.
And we should use meshes and composites.
My first idea was slip-on shoes, called the Post-Game.
[man] I mean, it's a whole other level now.
They're bringing it, and then we're loving it. I mean, keep doing what you're doing.
When I was a kid, people would wear two different shoes just for fashion.
That was the inspiration for the Tai Chi.
Visual-wise, you see the different colors. Like you're wearing different shoes.
-Hey! What's up? -What's up?
I remember the feeling of shock when those Tai Chis flew off the shelves.
[man] This is a really dope look.
Whoo! Fire on these.
One of the best basketball shoes, period.
[Seth] It became AND1's all-time best-selling shoe.
That product went from 0 to 65 million in 18 months.
[The Main Event] It started with the trash-talking shirts.
Now it's on a whole other level.
Every shoe company, we're coming.
You see the neighborhood hustlers and drug dealers.
They're wearing the AND1.
[Tom] We had styles that would either outsell Nike or be number two to them.
[Tom] You know, if you're going up against Nike,
they have 50 times more people in every department.
And when they go and make a marquee shoe for Michael Jordan,
they may take several years.
And we have, like, five dudes on design. [chuckling]
Sometimes Tom would be in his office for, like, three days.
[Tom] I logged long hours, but I really loved it.
That energy was infectious to the rest of us.
[anchor] Jordan's have sprung
from the creative partnership of shoe designer Tinker Hatfield.
[Jay] In a time where designers become their own celebrities,
Tom was super low-key, never wanted to have his name out there.
But he was one of the most incredibly creative designers.
I'm running my little kingdom. Just gonna generate high-quality shoes,
and if I keep doing my job, we're gonna beat Nike.
[Duke] Playing at Madison Square Garden, the mecca.
You know that I was hyped.
[The Main Event] The anticipation was crazy.
[The Main Event] I'm looking around like,
"Damn, this is what it would have been like in the NBA?"
We're in their same locker room. It's the same atmosphere.
[announcer] Welcome to New York City!
Took me 25 years to get here. I'm ready to cry.
I'm feeling this. I'm really feeling this.
[The Main Event] Out of all the games we wanted to win, we wanted to win at Madison Square Garden
because at the end of the day, you definitely want to win where you from.
[Hot Sauce] I'm actually on the NBA floor, scared as hell.
But you would never know it, walking around shaking your head,
like, "Yeah, Sauce, you about to kill,"
and deep down inside, I'm scared as a motherfucker, boy.
I'm scared as hell.
[Gee Lock] You had dreams of going to the NBA, you already felt like you made it
because here's your name on the big scoreboard.
Here's your name in bright lights.
I'm playing in front of thousands of people.
Boy, when we played on to that old-school Madison Square Garden court?
That bring a tear to your eye. That emotional.
That was our bragging rights to our family, to our friends on,
"No. We didn't make the NBA, but we made it."
[announcer] Are you ready?
[Duke] Professor! Alley-oop!
-Oh yeah! Yeah! -[crowd shouting, cheering]
It was ridiculous. I couldn't believe it.
It took so much time and energy to get here.
[Duke] Oh baby! It's Sizzle and The Pharmacist.
The New York game was a competitive game.
It was unlike all of most of our other games.
[Duke] Jump shot, 15-footer, nothing but the bottom of the net on.
Helicopter. Looking at it. Bounce pass. Watch this!
In Madison Square Garden, if there's enough excitement,
the building shakes. Half the block shakes.
[Duke] Looking to change. Professor.Â AO!
No matter who's on the floor, we gotta keep this intensity.
[Duke] That jump shot is good!
Oh gravy!
This is The Main Event! Man.
You done hit a jump shot in front of 19,000 people at the mecca.
You done hit a jump shot in front of 19,000 people at the mecca. You can't get no better than that.
[The Main Event] I met AND1 when I was 26 years old.
That bulk of my NBA days was over,
but my story, in a nutshell, is that I never gave up.
[Duke] New York City!
If you like what you see, then make some noise!
[Duke] Let's give it up for both these ball clubs!
You got it. You can get it.
-[man] Tell me about playing it, though. -Hey, manâ€¦
That shit was fun, man.
Let's get in, man.
-One, two, three, AND1. -[all] AND1!
[commentator] So we're ready for the first slam dunk competition in three years.
The last timeâ€¦
Never forget watching the dunk contest with Vince Carter,
who later signed with Nike.
[commentator 1] â€¦and here is the man that this crowd wants to see.
Vince Carter with his first dunk!
[commentator 2] Let's go home!
And Vince has maybe the best performance ever
in a dunk contest in AND1 Tai Chis.
Watching it blew our minds.
We pretty much lose our cool, right? It's like, "This is awesome."
And he did things that nobody thought were even possible.
While wearing our product.
We were like, "Thank you so much for wearing our shoes for free."
[Tom] That was the peak of AND1, you know?
And I think it was literally like two or three months later.
I turned on the TV.
I heard a ball bouncing. Boom. Ba-boom. Ba-boom, boom, boom.
-[man grunting] -[Seth] And I see the logo.
The first word that entered my brain was "fuck."
It's Nike.
Freestyle is all about hip-hop, streetball, and self-expression.
They've co-opted our streetball positioning
with this incredibly beautifully shot TV campaign.
I mean, that was a good spot.
It's got an attitude. Hip-hop beat to it.
But it's Nike, and they're better than that. They're copying us.
[Jay] That TV commercial achieved more in 30 seconds
than we did over five years of the Mixtape.
Gotta be the shoes. Nike surging.
[reporter 1] Investors came running back to Nike.
It's living up to its motto. "Just Do It."
[reporter 2] Just taking over this whole streetball game.
They took our movement,
put a nice shiny satin bow on it with some glitter, and called it theirs.
They basically crushed us in the snap of a finger.
[narrator] In a fight for glory, heart is mandatory.
Nike Underground's King of the Court. Sundays at 8:00 pm, 7:00 central on MTV2.
I don't know if they spent 10 million, 20 million, 50 million behind it.
I know when I saw that TV commercial that I realized, "Shit. We don't have time to wait. Let's go."
"Shit. We don't have time to wait. Let's go."
"We gotta make some decisions. We gotta move."
I'm on TV!
[producer] How would you respond to someone who felt that the company
built its wealth off the back of the players?
How would I respond
to somebody feeling like the players was exploited by the company?
I would say, "I know the company was making a lot of money."
After the games, you see the merchandise booth.
Mad units with they faces on it, right?
[man] We sold out again.
[Gee Lock] Players be like, "Yo. I ain't get paid for that."
It was the downfall of everything.
[woman] We're at the warehouse. We receive, ship, and pack, uh, the AND1 product for everyone.
We receive, ship, and pack, uh, the AND1 product for everyone.
[The Dribbling Machine] Up at 8:00 just to meet the people in the warehouse.
Courtesy.
How many courtesy things are we gonna do?
This company was making millions and millions of dollars. But we the ones who make the money for y'all.
It started becoming a thing that we're gettin' pizza,
but we go on a staff bus,
they got everything.
They got filetÂ mignon, calamari, seltzer water,
all the good shit.
What are you eating, Shane?
Before the game, uh,
Buca shrimpÂ parmesan.
[Chris] A lot of guys would say, "You got to take care of us."
"Why are we not eating?"
"Wouldn't be no tour if there were no players."
Because you're not wrong. Like, y'all should be eating,
but you don't gotta be so aggressive with it.
[Headache] I'm throwing itâ€¦ I'm throwing it on their bus.
[Duke] It's over now.
He throws a hot pizza on the tour manager's face!
[Headache] Tell her what I said. Tell her she got one more time.
I'll smack the shit out of her. I'm dead serious.
[producer] How did you guys decide which players would be making
a certain amount of money over others?
Not me. The onlyâ€¦ The only conversation I ever got involved with
was with Sauce and his agent.
It's my hometown. Still go down.
[Seth] He says, "Hey, Seth. You're a really nice guy."
I think to myself, "Yes, I am, motherfucker."
He says, "Hey. Sauce wants this, or he's gonna go to Reebok."
I was like, "Let him go to Reebok, bro."
Reebok's gonna kill that dude's career. Nobody wants to be with Reebok.
It was interesting 'cause there really wasn't a pay structure.
Main Event was like 90 to 100.
And AO was around that, 80 to 90.
Half Man was between like 60 and 75.
We had lower-tier guys that were getting like 15.
But that's for three months of work.
Because by the time September rolled around, there is no more tours.
But we would judge guys on who got the most "oohs" and "ahs,"
and obviously, Hot Sauce was the man.
It was plenty of moments of dudes feeling frustrated,
of not making enough money as somebody else was making.
But on the AND1 tours, best to not tell nobody how much you getting,
but they gonna say it because they like stunting on each other.
Let's go, baby.
Dollars, dollars, dollars. Yeah.
I had to get something new for 2005, you know.
A little bling. A little something.
This is Sizzle's crib. You know what I'm saying?
Thisâ€¦ this is my second crib. I got two cribs, whatever.
I remember Hot Sauce had a car that could talk.
[car] Greetings, Hot Sauce.
[laughing] People hated that shit.
I tried to never get into any money talks.
I knew that I was sort of the new guy, and I had a lot of marketability,
and I felt like my salary was great.
[director] And action.
There was definitely a little jealousy rolling around
from players being promoted more than others.
[AO] You see cats.
They had one or two big games. They are "streetball legends."
We was grinding likeâ€¦ nine, ten years
before we even knew whatÂ AND1 was.
[Headache] Oh man, don't get me wrong. Professor's a heck of a basketball player,
but, um, I question sometimes his motive.
[The Professor] It doesn't really bother me. I mean,
as long as we're out on tour having fun, I really don't care what they think.
Honestly.
The rock star started getting into everybody's head.
And everybody started thinking about the money.
Youâ€¦ You stop acting like that, man. Damn, man, fuck!
[man] How you figure that? Where you getting the check from?
If I wasn't here, I'd be out playing and making money.
This tour? It's breaking me. I'm not making money.
My contract ain't shit, man. I'm telling y'all niggas. It ain't shit, yo! It ain't shit!
I'm eating off this. I'm making plenty of money.
I don't know about you, man. My living expenses ain't like yours.
You live in luxury, nigga. You live in luxury. I'm still living in the projects, nigga!
We got too many all-stars.
When you create a monster,
you gotta know how to tame a monster.
The animosity against each other boiled up to a point
where it was becoming bigger and bigger and bigger.
-Why you don't ask me? -'Cause I'm not-- [bleep]
Why not? I ask the coach a question!
-[man] That's why. -[Hot Sauce] I don't disrespect you.
-[Ziggy] I'm not talking to you! -Eat a dick! Eat a dick, nigga!
I ain't trying to hear that shit, man!
-Who's a bitch, Zig? Who? -[Ziggy] You!
[man] Bro, don't get this shit.
We look like clowns.
That shit's getting crazy.
[man 2] Yo, why y'all grabbing me? Why you grabbing me, though, man?
[Tom] When I took over footwear, we had a phenomenal business success.
We were doing 90% of the sales.
At that point, I felt like the whole company was on my shoulders to a degree.
[Jay] So Tom decided to move over to Taiwan
because he could influence the quality of the product much better
because he could influence the quality of the product much better sitting there at the factory.
I was worried because Tom's an incredibly hard worker.
I probably worked 364 days a year on average.
I just lived in, like, airports and hotels,
switching 12 time zones every six weeks.
Without me realizing it, it became too much. [man] So if you look at the drawing that's right hereâ€¦
Ended up getting diagnosed with a digestive disorder.
I lost like 20 or 30 pounds.
I remember Seth and Jay called me at 2:00, 3:00 in the morning Asian time.
"How's it going? What's next?" And I just lost it.
"That's it. I am sick of you chirping at me."
"I'm doing what I'm doing. You know, you guys can't do this."
And I hung up.
I know Tom did feel some pressures from outside,
and particularly from me as the person to whom he directly reported.
I kind of ended up pulling back into my own little shell.
I lost friendships during that time.
I just ended up a mess, physically and emotionally.
For the first time in my life, it wasn't fun.
It wasn't always easy, but it had always been fun.
[Seth] So Tom comes into my office.
He says, "Seth, I'm resigning."
I'm like, "Wait. What?" Like, that's impossible.
[Jay] After Tom left us, we cratered.
We went from over 200 million in sales to, you know, 130.
I had to lay off 20% of the staff.
We knew we only had a small window to sell the company
in order to maximize the financial value.
[Duke] Paoli, Pennsylvania.
The 2005 minicamp.Â Mixtape Tour!
AO!
[The Professor] I just got word from the people at AND1
that we're to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated.
Growing up, to be on Sports Illustrated, it's like the king of sports magazines.
It's going down. It's official.
Right. We gotta frame this right here.
[The Professor] Before the beginning of the 2005 tour,
we didn't get a call right away to renew our contracts.
So it was confusing.
We was just frustrated with the way everything was going on.
So many stories has been going around.
[The Professor] All of a sudden, the staff rounded us up in a room.
So I'm like, "Heck is going on here?" He's like, "Yo, just chill."
[The Professor] And they told us, "Hey. There's going to be a major buy-out,
and things aren't gonna be the same."
It was unexpected.
It was gone. That was it.
No notice.
No notice.
The players are so prideful that I don't think they will ever tell you that they felt down.
that I don't think they will ever tell you that they felt down.
At the end of the day, we mint. But I think about the audacity for them
not sitting with none of the legends when that shit ended.
It should be a success story.
AND1 was huge. We created something from nothing.
We sold the business, and we all made a lot of money,
but the sale, in the end, was so hard for me physically,
and then it was also just, like, really sad.
There was infighting and some fracturing of relationships,
and emotionally it's still, like, bittersweet.
Definitely.
[announcer] You may recognize his face from ESPN Streetball!
-Shane "The Dribble Machine" Woney! -[crowd cheering, applauding]
Court Jesters is a semi-pro league version of theâ€¦ of the Harlem Globetrotters.
Thisâ€¦ This ain't like the Garden. Nothing like the Garden, baby.
I may see a guy that recognizes me, and they ask me a question like,
"What you doing working here, man? You was on TV."
That right there is a heartbreaker.
Every day I wake up saying, "Man. I hope something happens
where they say, 'You know what? Shane, we need you just for today.'"
This is what I think.
We didn't get paid what we was worth.
How about that? How about that? Our worth.
They came to the hood and took everything.
The hood gives them their opinions or whatever, "Y'all should do this."
They run right upstairs and do it,
and then they sell it and don't give nothing back.
Like I always said. It's called "Poverty Pimping."
People say, "Well, corporate America is trying to take advantage of you and make money."
That's what the outside world perceives, and being on the inside, that wasn't the case.
We were trying to catch lightning in a bottle
and do something cool.
If we're guilty of anything, it was that.
The contracts that we signed with them weren't insignificant.
We paid some of the Mixtape players more than we paid other NBA players.
They signed us to a contract,
now it's up to us to agree to that number.
We don't have to agree to that number.
The money they offered me? Heck yeah, I'm gonna take it.
I don't care what y'all got to say about it.
"Oh, you're not loyal. Shit isâ€¦" Loyal to what?
That loyalty ain't gonna give me no check. I know that.
Did they love us for what we did? Yeah.
But did they respect us?
Answer me that.
[Jay] One of my biggest regrets.
Had we thought of the Mixtape players like employees
Had we thought of the Mixtape players like employees as opposed to endorsed athletes,
then we could have given them some stock options.
And that would have resulted in some incremental wealth
going to all those players.
[The Dribbling Machine] Our lives didn't matter to them.
-I think it's a-- I think it's aâ€¦ -Our lives didn't matter, man.
-Main. Our livesâ€¦ My manâ€¦ -Maybe.
Iâ€¦ Listen, listen, listen.
My last final year with AND1,
I asked that man for $16,000 to put my son in school for a contract,
and then they told me, "I cannot help you."
After all that shit we did.
Iâ€¦ I don't remember it.
I'm sad that I don't remember it.
It is possible Shane spoke directly to me,
um, and ifâ€¦ and if that's the case and we were not able to take care of him and his kid, I feel terrible.
and we were not able to take care of him and his kid, I feel terrible.
[The Dribbling Machine] Honestly, we can say they robbed us,
but the money will never, ever supersede the experience.
Having a passport and traveling from country to country,
it's educational.
[Skip 2 My Lou] I've always felt so indebted to AND1 for what it's provided me.
There's things I probably wouldn't do because my mom and dad didn't have the resources for me to travel.
because my mom and dad didn't have the resources for me to travel.
That's big-time, man.
[Gee Lock] AND1 created opportunities that you was never getting.
I would have never
thought of
leaving the city, of leaving Brooklyn.
[AO] Bro.
I didn't know it was gonna be like this.
I did not know Tokyo and all these other cities were gonna be like this.
[The Main Event] AND1 basketball allowed a guy, Waliyy Dixon, from Linden, New Jersey,
make some of our dreams come true.
The Pharmacist!
[Skip 2 My Lou] AND1 has allowed everyone to think outside the box about this game.
Their stuff was for all people, you know,
not just people that make it in the professional world.
[commentator] Butler's gonna trigger the inbound. It's Alston.
This is for the win! It's good!
Are you kidding me?
AND1 changed the game.
The NBA is now more entertaining and free-going.
-[man] Oh no, he didn't! -[man 2] What a play by Paul!
You seeÂ some of the guys right now, today, we're talking about superstars, do some of the movesâ€¦
we're talking about superstars, do some of the movesâ€¦
[commentator] Curry. Oh, pretty fake! Pulls up.
They don't have to give props.
[Hot Sauce] We know who it came from.
Footwork! Left foot. Right foot.
Bang, bang, bang, bang. Finish.
Main, the legacy, when you say that--
Was itâ€¦ Was it big, and did we make it?
Main, of course we made it because when you walking down the street with your son
because when you walking down the street with your son and a stranger tell your son,
"Do you know who your father is?"
Thatâ€¦ That doesn't happen to ordinary people.
At the end of the day,
we will always be,
"Yo, that's them dudes from AND1."
-[man] One, two, three, AND1! -[all] AND1
Allegations against one basketball ref
of betting the outcome of games is rocking the NBA.
[man] Man, did I fuck my life up.
[reporter 1] Just like the feel-good hit of the summer,
the Manti Te'o story isn't real.
[man] Cruel, twisted folks.
It was the longest winning streak in history of sport.
[reporter 2] This is the finest day in the history of Australian sports!
[The Dribbling Machine] AND1 was making millions of dollars.
But did they respect us?
[Duke] AND1 basketball, baby!
[man] Shut your fucking mouth.
Keep it between us.
Stick to the fucking story.
[anchor 1] It could not get any stranger than this oneâ€¦

Kathy, the coin!
-Quick, Tim. Catch it! -[Tim] No.
I-I can't see it.
[gasps] Oi, ratbag!
Why don't you watch where you're walking, you great clumsy lump!
Sorry, Mr. Scrooge, sir. Didn't realize it was you.
Good dog.
Prudence, stop licking that poor boy.
You've no idea where he's been. [laughs]
[ghostly whisper] Scrooge.
[Scrooge whistles] Come now, Prudence.
Bye.
Uncle?
Uncle Ebenezer, is that you?
[sighs] That was close.
Uncle, it is you! I knew it.
Merry Christmas.
[sighs] And where is she?
Where's the finest lady in all of London?
Prudence, girl.
You grow more beautiful with every passing year.
Is Uncle Scrooge taking good care of you, is he?
You don't miss that rotten old Jacob Marley too much?
Why, I was just on my way to your office, Uncle.
What luck to run into you.
Well, Harry, they say a man makes his own luck.
So I suppose I only have myself to blame for this encounter.
Out of time, Jenkins.
Good girl. Oh, yes.
There it is.
Yeah, there's a good girl. Yes.
-Care to make a donation? -To the festive fund for the poor?
-Just enough to make Christmas merry. -Or perhaps a little bit more?
Do you have a permit to perform here?
We didn't know we needed one. Did you know we needed one?
I didn't know we needed one. We didn't know we needed one.
Well, now you know you need one.
So pack up your trumpets, before I call the policeâ€¦
â€¦to throw you all in prison, leaving me in peace.
Good day, ladies. [laughs]
[ghostly whisper] Scroogeâ€¦
[both] How rude!
Uncle! Uncle!
Oh, splendid.
-Uh, here you go. -Oh!
Thank you very much, sir. Such generosity.
Such generosity. Thank you very much, sir.
Think nothing of it.
Why, who would be uncharitable at Christmas?
[both scoff] Who indeed.
Uncle. Wait for us!
I swear I had your money in hand yesterday, Mr. Scrooge.
It's just that my mother, she got sick, you see, and I had to pay for a doctor.
Another fascinating story, Jenkins. But here's a better one.
Once upon a time,
Tom Jenkins, that's you,
owed me, Ebenezer Scrooge, 25 pounds.
Jenkins paid the money in full, and Scrooge lived happily ever after.
The end.
Oh, come on now, Mr. Scrooge, sir. I don't have it right now,
but I'm sure I can scrape it together in another three, four days.
Five. A week.
-Come on, it is Christmas after all. -[toy trumpet plays]
Louder.
Faster!
-He's rubbish. -[laughter]
Christmas? Really? If only I'd known. This changes everything.
Very well, in the spirit of the season,
Mr. Tom Jenkins, you now have until the end of Boxing Day to pay me.
Two extra days. How does that sound?
Two days is better than nothing, I suppose.
Thank you very much, Mr. Scrooge. Most charitable indeed.
Father Christmas has nothing on you.
Ho ho ho, yes, quite.
Now, let's see.
For the inconvenience you have caused me and the extra two days,
shall we say another 25 pounds?
-That would mean I owe-- -Fifty pounds.
It's a good, round number, wouldn't you agree?
Well, 30 is a round number too, Mr. Scrooge.
You're right. But so is 60.
When you put it that way, 50 does have a better ring to it.
â™ª Two days, Jenkins, then I'll be backÂ â™ª
â™ª To take my 50 poundsÂ â™ª
Do give my best to Mother Jenkins.
Oh, and Tom,
merry Christmas.
Fifty pounds. Two days.
Look out. [groans]
[both] Merry Christmas.
-[ghostly whisper] Scrooge. -[Scrooge] Hmm?
[Harry] I say, Mr. Jenkins. Do you deliver?
-[toy squeaks] -Mr. Jenkins?
Bah, humbug.
Left a bit. Right a bit. Left a bit again.
Up. No, up.
Left.
Your other left.
There, perfect. You're an artist, Mickey.
An artist would get paid more than a penny for every thousand posters he sticks up, Beryl.
You there. Yes, you. Who are you? What do you think you're doing?
Who, us?
Sir, we is nothing but a bunch of poor, homeless urchins
trying to make our way in the world.
Quick. Leg it!
Merry Christmas! [laughs]
Blooming children.
-[door slams] -[yelps] Mr. Scrooge. Oh dear.
Welcome back, sir. There's something I should tell you.
The cost of that ink will be deducted from your pay.
What? The ink? Oh. Oh, the ink. Of course, sir, yes.
Get on with your work, Cratchit.
-If it's not too much of an inconvenience. -But, sir--
-I do not wish to be disturbed. -[Bob] Yes.
I've had more than my fill of people for oneâ€¦ -[toy trumpet plays] -â€¦day.
-We win! -How in the world did youâ€¦?
-Prudence knows a shortcut, don't you? -[barks]
Very well, let's get this over with then, shall we?
How does it go again? Oh, yes, yes, the question.
"Uncle, won't you join me for Christmas dinner tomorrow?"
The answer,
"No, Harry, I will not."
"Christmas is a humbug. I despise it and all it stands for."
The same answer to the same question you ask me every year.
I have no time to be merry.
Just because my partner is dead doesn't mean I have no business to attend to.
Quite the opposite. Jacob Marley died seven years ago this very night,
leaving me nothing but business.
Oh, yes, and you.
Oh, come now, Uncle. Hela and I would just love to have you.
Hela? Who's Hela?
You know, Hela, my wife.
She was disappointed you couldn't attend the wedding,
and simply can't wait to meet you.
So at least visit us this evening.
Some friends and I are gathering to toast the season.
Good day, Harry.
Uncle, I'm all the family you have. Why does it have to be this way?
I think Mother would have been so disappointed that you and I spend every Christmas apart.
that you and I spend every Christmas apart.
Harry, life is full of disappointments.
One such disappointment came on the glorious Christmas Day
that you stumbled into this world.
The very same Christmas Day your mother,
my beloved sister, left it.
I will not be joining you for Christmas dinner,
nor any other celebration of this wretched season.
Now, please leave before I say something you will regret.
[ghostly whisper] Scrooge.
My offer still stands. You are always welcome, Uncle.
-Goodbye! -Merry Christmas, Prudence.
-Bob. -Merry Christmas, sir.
[clears throat] Excuse me, sir, but it's almost 6:00. Six o'clock.
Could I trouble you for my wages, please?
Cratchit, Cratchit, Cratchitâ€¦
you do nothing but trouble me.
-[chuckles] Yeah. -[Prudence whimpers]
Five, 10, 15 shillings.
-[Bob] Thank you, sir. -Take away five.
But I'm owed 15.
Consider the other five your payment to me.
-For what, sir? -The ink, of course.
And the day off you insist on taking tomorrow.
Well, sir, it is Christmas.
Yes, as everyone is so fond of telling me.
Sir, this isn't enough. My family, you see, my childrenâ€¦ Myâ€¦ My boy needs medicine.
You have children?
Of course you do.
Cratchit, times are hard. And my financial burdens are considerable.
Now should I add to them by paying for theÂ upkeep of your entire family?
-[ghostly whisper] Scroogeâ€¦ -[Scrooge] Does that sound fair to you?
-[ghostly whisper] Scroogeâ€¦ -[Scrooge] Does that sound fair to you? No, sir.
No, sir, indeed. Now, let's get you on your way, shall we?
-Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge. -Yes, yes. Ding-dong, merrily.
I expect you at half past seven on Boxing Day.
What? What have I done now?
Why, if it isn't the amazing and wonderful Cratchit children!
[both] Father!
-[gasps] Tim! -Father, help!
It's all right, my little man. Just breathe, slowly.
He's getting worse.
That's it. There you go.
Right, you two. That's it, no more busking tonight.
It's freezing out here, and you need your rest, young man. Aw.
-But we've only made ten pence ha'penny. -Ten pence ha'penny? A bumper windfall!
If we add that to the ten shillings I happen to have in my pocket
and throw in a bit ofÂ Cratchit magic,
I reckon we can have as fine a Christmas as the Lord Mayor himself.
-[both] Yay! -[Bob] Just wait and see.
Oh, don't be so dramatic.
I'll pick up a juicy bone for you on the way home. How does that sound?
-The butcher owes me seven pounds sixâ€¦ -[Prudence scoffs]
â€¦so I'm sure he'll be happy to oblige.
[ghostly whisper] Scroogeâ€¦
No? No pleasing some people.
You there. What do you think you're doing? [laughs]
Oh, bravo!
There you go.
Merry Christmas.
You two!
Clear off!
Disgusting.
[ghostly whisper] Ebenezer Scroogeâ€¦
â™ª Every year, the same remindersÂ â™ª
â™ª Of the things I'veÂ lostÂ â™ª
â™ª Absent friends and broken pledgesÂ â™ª
â™ª Wrapped in freezing frostÂ â™ª
â™ª Why should I be bright and merry?Â â™ª
â™ª Why should I? Won't someone tell me?Â â™ª
â™ª Tell meÂ â™ª
â™ª Tell meÂ â™ª
[man] There you go, sir.
â™ª Cold, bleak winters filled with sorrowÂ â™ª
â™ª All I've ever knownÂ â™ª
â™ª Season's greetings?Â â™ª â™ª You can keep themÂ â™ª
â™ª Just leave me aloneÂ â™ª
â™ª Just leave me aloneÂ â™ª [ghostly whisper] Scrooge.
â™ª "Why not join us, toast the season?" â™ª
â™ª Don't they know I have my reasons?Â â™ª
â™ª Tell meÂ â™ª
â™ª Tell meÂ â™ª
â™ª Tell meÂ â™ª
â™ª Tell meÂ â™ª
â™ª Every year, such joy and gladnessÂ â™ª
â™ª Sparkling in their eyesÂ â™ª
â™ª Treat them tougherÂ â™ª
â™ª Make them sufferÂ â™ª
â™ª Bring them down to sizeÂ â™ª
â™ª All around meÂ â™ª
â™ª Oh, so cheeryÂ â™ª
â™ª I'm not happy, so why should they be? â™ª
â™ª Tell meÂ â™ª
â™ª Tell meÂ â™ª
Tell me!
Ebenezer Scrooge.
J-J-J-Jacob Marley?
Impossible. You're dead.
Dead?
Dead tired! [laughs]
Oh, yeah. How embarrassing.
-[Prudence growls] -Prudence. Oh, how well you look. [laughs]
I knew leaving you in the care of Uncle Scrooge
was the right thing to do, hmm? Didn't I?
Hmm? Yes, I did. I did. [chuckles]
I do apologize for the dramatic entrance, old boy.
Those in charge insist on a touch of pageantry.
Goes with the territory, you see.
But I'm sure you and I can discuss the rest like reasonable men.
Ah, I must have drifted off by the fire.
I'm dreaming.
[laughs] Serves me right for eating cheese so close to bedtime.
Well,
very well.
[Scrooge] Ye gods!
[Jacob] Listen well, Scrooge.
This is no dream.
Look upon the chain that binds me.
In life, I forged it, link by link, yard by yard.
It grew to match my greed.
In death, I will never be rid of it.
Nor will you yours.
[gasps] Mine? Yes, yours.
[Jacob] We were all like you.
Trapped in our own selfish worlds.
We never reached out to our fellow men in life,
so are condemned to do so in death.
We have watched you many a day, Scrooge.
Watched your chain grow, link by link, yard by yard.
But you may yet escape our fate.
I have pulled a few chains
and arranged for three visitors to call on you before morning.
The first, when the bell tolls 1:00.
The second, at 2:00.
And the third, atâ€¦
Well, 3:00.
Listen to these visitors. Learn from them.
And heed my warning
before it's too late.
Jacob Marley
concerned for someone else's well-being?
Well, it must have been a dream.
Huh?
Humbug.
It's that nephew of mine. Interfering. Bringing my blood to the boil.
Has me jumping at shadows. Seeing things. Yes.
That's it. Yes.
[Jacob] The first, at 1:00.
-Hello? -[ghost yelps]
Oh, hello.
It's Scrooge, isn't it?
Yes, that's the one, Scrooge. [chuckles] What a funny name.
Are you comfortable down there, Scrooge?
Uh, wellâ€¦ Never mind that.
Who, or what, are you?
And it's "Mr. Scrooge," if you please.
Well, Mr. Scrooge-if-you-please, who am I?
I can be anyone you have ever known. I can even be you.
Bah, humbugs.
Christmas is an outrage.
Grr, give me your money. -Interest rates, and so on. -Hmm.
You were not told of my coming? No? No matter.
You have nothing to fear from me. After all, your welfare is my business.
Miss, to be disturbed at this hour is hardly conducive to my welfare.
Your redemption, then.
You see, an old friend of yours
asked me to illuminate a thing or two for you. I--
Illuminate what, exactly?
I was getting to that. You are an impatient one. [clears throat]
I will show you the past.
Christmas past.
Specifically, your Christmas past. Ahh!
There. Much better.
I've gone mad.
Mad, you say?
Jacob Marley floating in my sitting room. Faces etched in frost. Whispers in the wind.
Faces etched in frost. Whispers in the wind. A blizzard indoors.
Now you, a talking waxwork with a wick for brains.
My dreams are never thisâ€¦ exciting.
And none of this can be real. So, yes, I must be awake,
but quite insane.
Well, I may have wick for brains, but I do think I'm real.
Here.
-[growls] -[Past] Oh, hush now.
There, did that feel real?
I-I suppose it did.
It hurt too.
[chuckles] Yes, the past can hurt. Especially yours.
But it can also heal, if you learn from it.
-Now, come with me. -Absolutely not.
I refuse to go anywhereâ€¦
Yeah!
[Scrooge] No, no!
Oh, baby Scrooge!
Where? W-What? Who?
Get off!
Sorry, it does take its toll going this far back.
-Did I not warn you? -No, you certainly--
Wait, what do you mean by "back"?
Huh?
-Whatâ€¦? -We're not quite there yet.
Almost.
Here we are.
The past. [chuckles]
Spooky! [chuckles]
I know this place.
It was demolished years ago. I saw to that.
â™ª â€¦looked out on the Feast of StephenÂ â™ª
You there. What day is it?
I say-- [groans]
[chuckles] I wouldn't do that. You can't interfere with anything here.
And nobody can hear you. Or see you, for that matter.
-[man] Don't fill it right to the top. -Look!
Young Ebenezer Scrooge, hard at work on Christmas Eve.
Not very festive, is it?
Iâ€¦ I-I had no choice.
You see, without the modest income I provided, my mother and sister,
th-they would have starved.
-Did your father not have any money? -My father?
He was not a poor man, but the fool spent his way into debtors' prison.
Oh, I see.
Debtors' prison. Terrible, terrible thing, a debtors' prison.
-What is a debtors' prison again? -A debtors' prison is, uhâ€¦
None of your business.
[laughs] You can't escape your past, mate. Now, look here--
[girl] â™ª The wish that you wish On Christmas Day â™ª
â™ª Is pretty well sure to come true They say â™ª
â™ª So the wish that I wish you tonight My friendÂ â™ª
â™ª May you spend Christmas morningsÂ â™ª
-â™ª Without endÂ â™ª -Jen?
â™ª Dreaming of a miracle or twoÂ â™ª
My dear little sister, Jen.
â™ª And may all your Christmas wishesÂ â™ª
â™ª Come trueÂ â™ª
-Jen. Come on, breathe. -[Jen coughs]
Slowly.
In and out.
That's it.
What are you doing here alone?
-Does Mother know you're out? -I wanted to give you this.
I made it all by myself.
-Merry Christmas, Ebenezer. -Oh, Jen. It's Father Christmas.
-He's really magnificent. -[Jen chuckles]
Maybe you could help me make one for you in return.
Yes, please! [Jen laughs]
Shall we sing that pretty song of yours as we walk?
[both] â™ª The wish that you wish On Christmas Day â™ª
â™ª Is pretty well sure to come true They say â™ª
Oh, such a sweet child. Will she be all right?
She will be. For a while, at least, the sickness will not take her.
My father paid his debts, eventually.
We found the right doctor and she was saved. Butâ€¦
[Past] But?
She remained a delicate soul, whom a breath might have withered.
Jen died in childbirth. My idiot nephew in exchange for my sister.
A sorry transaction in any currency. And all on Christmas Day.
Christmas.
Oof. Humbug.
Oh, come now.
Is there not one Christmas you remember fondly?
One buried, perhaps, in a hole as deep as old Marley's grave?
-Merry Christmas, sir. -[Scrooge groans]
Hello, Uncle.
I do believe I've found one.
Mr. Fezziwig.
"Fizzywig?" Why, that's almost as silly as "Scrooge."
Off we go.
-A little jump forward this time. -Wait--
[sighs] I'm home then. And not before time.
Very well. You have a week and no more. Or we shall both have to find new employment.
-Good day. -Thank you very much, Mr. Scrooge.
-Good day. -Thank you very much, Mr. Scrooge. God bless ya. And a merry Christmas when it comes.
[grumbles] It's still the past.
It is.
My word, you were a handsome chap, Scrooge.
What went wrong?
[Fezziwig] Ebenezer?
Is that you, lad?
-Mr. Fezziwig? -[Fezziwig] It is you! Wonderful to see you, my boy.
[Past] So that's Mr. Wizzyfig.
Fezziwig. Yes, I used to work in his warehouse before Marley took me on.
Why didn't you keep working for him?
Marley offered a position with more security.
People will always need money.
If I'd stayed, I would only have been Fezziwig's lowly apprentice.
I had to better myself before even thinking of proposing to her.
Proposing?
Oh, I do like a wedding. Who's her? Where's her?
[Fezziwig] Flora!
Isabel.
Yes, Father?
-Isabel. -Isabel.
[Fezziwig] Look who I found!
Ebenezer! How lovely to see you.
My, you look splendid in your suit.
-Although, do you mind? -Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦
-That isâ€¦ -There.
-That isâ€¦ -There. -You seeâ€¦ -Perfect.
-You seeâ€¦ -Perfect.
Thank you.
Oh, Isabel, how I love thee.
With thy big slobbery face and stinking dog breath.
Uh, Ebenezer, do you have any plans for tomorrow?
-Tomorrow, sir? -You know, Christmas Day, my boy!
No, sir. My sister is with her husband in Kent.
They're expecting a child any day now.
She invited me to visit, but I had to decline.
[laughs] Then it's decided!
You'll join us for Christmas lunch tomorrow.
I'm not sure I can.
Too much still to be done, and Mr. Marley doesn't even take the day himself.
Say you'll come, Ebenezer. It'll be such fun.
[Past] Oh, look away.
I, uhâ€¦
I'll talk to Mr. Marley.
-Did you go? -Well, it would have been rude not to.
-Did you go? -Well, it would have been rude not to. I felt obliged.
I see.
See you there.
But you didn't enjoy it?
No. Not one bit.
-[laughs] Oh my goodness. -[Scrooge laughs]
You look like you're having an awful time.
Uh, yes.
â™ª They say happiness Is a thing you can't seeÂ â™ª
â™ª A thing you can't touch, I disagreeÂ â™ª
â™ª Happiness is the folly of foolsÂ â™ª
â™ª Pity poor me, one of those foolsÂ â™ª
â™ª Happiness is standing beside meÂ â™ª
â™ª I can see himÂ â™ª
â™ª He can see meÂ â™ª
â™ª Happiness is whatever You want it to be â™ª
â™ª They say happiness Is a thing you can't see â™ª
â™ª A thing you can't touch, I disagreeÂ â™ª
â™ª Happiness is the folly of foolsÂ â™ª
â™ª Pity poor me, one of those foolsÂ â™ª
â™ª Happiness is smiling upon meÂ â™ª
â™ª Walking my way, sharing my dayÂ â™ª
â™ª Happiness is whatever You want it to be â™ª
[both] â™ª Happiness is a bright starÂ â™ª
â™ª Are we happy? Yes, we areÂ â™ª
â™ª Happiness is a clear skyÂ â™ª
â™ª Give me wings and justÂ â™ª
â™ª Just let me flyÂ â™ª
â™ª Let me flyÂ â™ª
â™ª Just let me flyÂ â™ª
â™ª Let me flyÂ â™ª
â™ª Just let me flyÂ â™ª
â™ª Let me flyÂ â™ª
[Past] A delightful woman.
Without her,
Jen's death would have taken an even greater toll on me.
You married her, yes?
[Scrooge] No. Not quite. I--
No?
-I would very much like to see why not. -No!
Iâ€¦
I do wish you would stop doing that.
Home. Finally.
Well, goodbye, whatever you are.
I would say it's been a pleasure, but it hasn't.
Where's my name?
This is before Marley made me a partner.
Ebenezer? Hello?
-I'm still in the past. -[Isabel] Hello?
Oh, you do catch on quickly, don't you?
Ebenezer? Are you there? I brought some lunch.
I see so little of you these days, so I thoughtâ€¦
[sighs] I'm not sure what I thought.
Ah, lovely Isabel.
-But you said you didn't marry her? -We areâ€¦
Were merely engaged. For quite some time.
I see. I thought you would have gone back to work for Wiggyfiz?
Of course not!
His charity would have led to the same ruination that befell my family.
"His charity would have led to the same ruination
that befell my blah, blah, blah."
I needed more security than he could offer. We needed it.
I saw them by the baker's only a few minutes ago. Good day.
[grumbles] Lead on, Scrooge. Lead on. Allons-y.
Please, Mr. Marley, sir. This is my livelihood. My home.
My family will starve. Just one more week.
One more day, and I'll have your money, I swear.
You've had three weeks already. I am sorry.
No. No apologies, Ebenezer.
Times are hard, and my financial burdens are considerable.
Should I add to them by paying for the upkeep of your entire family?
Does that sound fair to you?
-Sir, it's Christmas Eve. -Come on.
Please, show some mercy.
-[woman] Where are you taking him? -[man] Clear off. Go on. On your way!
[Scrooge] â€¦and my financial burdens are considerable.
Now should I add to them by paying for the upkeep of your entire family?
Does that sound fair to you, Cratchit?
Iâ€¦ I don't recall this at all.
I'm not surprised. As horrible as this situation is,
I'm sure it was of great financial benefit to you and Marley.
Apart from the delightful Miss Fizzlejig,
you only seem to remember encounters where you lose money.
You dwell on the bad things in life, and then learn nothing from them.
Does Cratchit know?
Why would he choose to work for me? After what Iâ€¦
If his father had only paid his debtsâ€¦
It's not my fault.
[gasps] Isabel.
She saw all of this.
[Isabel] Ebenezer. Can I talk to you?
Alone.
[sighs] Not now, Isabel.
I have far too much work. Later, later.
I'll, uh, leave you two lovebirds to it.
-[growls] -[Jacob] Come, Boris.
No.
â™ª When we first metÂ â™ª
â™ª Your heart was freeÂ â™ª
â™ª Your hopeful eyesÂ â™ª
â™ª Saw only meÂ â™ª
â™ª Now you're looking forÂ somethingÂ â™ª
â™ª Something I can never beÂ â™ª
â™ª When you are reallyÂ â™ª
â™ª All I needÂ â™ª
â™ª You keep on telling me "later"Â â™ª
â™ª But "later" never comes aroundÂ â™ª
â™ª Please stop telling me "later" â™ª
â™ª As you search For what just can't be found â™ª
â™ª Take my handÂ â™ª
â™ª Come with me now and we'll fly freeÂ â™ª
â™ª No more "later" We both know that's a lie â™ª
â™ª Don't let this be the day I sayÂ â™ª
â™ª Goodbye â™ª
â™ª Goodbye â™ª
â™ª When you met herÂ â™ª
â™ª You were set free â™ª
â™ª Her love for youÂ â™ª
â™ª Was plain to seeÂ â™ª
â™ª You kept looking for somethingÂ â™ª
â™ª A measure of securityÂ â™ª
â™ª But she was reallyÂ â™ª
â™ª All you'd needÂ â™ª
â™ª You kept on telling her "later"Â â™ª
â™ª But "later" never comes aroundÂ â™ª
â™ª Please stop telling her "later"Â â™ª
â™ª Stop searching for what can't be foundÂ â™ª
â™ª Take her handÂ â™ª
â™ª Go with her now and you'll fly freeÂ â™ª
â™ª No more "later" We both know that's a lie â™ª
â™ª This will be the day she saysÂ â™ª
â™ª GoodbyeÂ â™ª [Isabel] â™ª GoodbyeÂ â™ª
-â™ª GoodbyeÂ â™ª -â™ª Goodbye â™ª
[Jacob] Ebenezer?
Some assistance, please.
Yes, Jacob, coming.
Later, Isabel.
No!
There is no "later!"
Goodbye, Ebenezer.
[Past] Oh, look. A wee glimpse into Isabel's future.
Oh, she looks so happy.
And her husband's gorgeous.
Thatâ€¦ That could have been you, I suppose. Oh, too bad, Scrooge. Too bad.
Why show me all of this now? What's done is done. I can't go back.
When we were financially secure, I would have married herâ€¦
eventually.
Wouldn't I?
I don't know.
-[Scrooge yells] -Bye!
Take me back. Take me back!
I'm afraid I can't.
There is no going back, nor changing what has been.
You said so yourself.
You can't change the past, but you can learn from it.
For your own sake, I hope you do, Scrooge.
-Ooh. -[Scrooge] No, no, no, no!
Whoo! It really is time to go.
Farewell, Scrooge.
Farewell. [laughs]
No, please! Don't leave me here!
I must.
Ooh. I have shown you what was.
Now another will show you what is.
Remember what you have seen, Scrooge.
Remember. Learn.
Change while you still can!
[Jacob] The second, at 2:00.
Hello?
Is there anybody there?
[Scrooge] Strange, annoying, candle lady thing?
Hello?
Huh?
Who dares disturb my slumber?
State thy name and business, puny mortal.
[laughs] I can'tâ€¦
I can'tâ€¦ I can't keep it up.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. -It was her. She dared me. -[cheerling laughs]
Oh, we do like to have fun here.
Don't worry.
I know who you are.
Come on, bring it in, Ebenezer Scrooge. Bring it in!
-[Scrooge groans] -Welcome, my friend. Welcome.
Welcome where?
Where am I?
When am I?
Oh, you are in the here and now. In the present!
Isn't it just fabulous?
It's fine, I suppose.
From here, I can go anywhere I please.
Just so long as it's happening right now.
And I do so love to visit
your teeny-tiny,Â tootsy-wootsy, little planet at this time of year.
So much love, generosity, and good cheer!
Which, conversely, brings me to you.
-Me? -Yes, you.
Squeezing, wrenching, grasping, clutching, covetous you!
Secret and solitary as an oyster, you edge along the crowded paths of life
keeping everyone at a distance.
Why, you stopped truly living your life so long ago, you might as well be dead.
Do not presume to tell me how to live my life.
I lead a good life.
I'm a good man. [grunts]
[Present] Ha!Â "A good man," he says.
[rapping] â™ª Ebenezer ScroogeÂ â™ª
â™ª The sins of man are hugeÂ â™ª
â™ª A never-ending symphony Of villainy and infamyÂ â™ª
â™ª Of mischief, mayhem, misery Deceit and subterfugeÂ â™ª
â™ª And no one's worse than you Mr. Ebenezer ScroogeÂ â™ª
â™ª But while the likes of you Make life seem like a living hellÂ â™ª
â™ª You know, life has A brighter side as well, whoo! â™ª
[singing] â™ª I like life, life likes meÂ â™ª
â™ª Life and I fairly fully agreeÂ â™ª
â™ª Life is fine, life is goodÂ â™ª
â™ª Especially mine Which is just as it should beÂ â™ª
â™ª I like life, here and nowÂ â™ª
â™ª Life and I made a mutual vowÂ â™ª
â™ª Till I die, life and IÂ â™ª
â™ª We'll both try to be better somehowÂ â™ª
â™ª Yes, I like living the life And why not? â™ª
â™ª 'Cause life's a pleasureÂ â™ª
â™ª That I deny notÂ â™ª
â™ª I like lifeÂ â™ª Whoo! â™ª Life likes meÂ â™ª
â™ª I make life a perpetual spreeÂ â™ª
â™ª Eating food, drinking wineÂ â™ª
â™ª Thinking who'd like The privilege to join meÂ â™ª
â™ª I like life, you should tooÂ â™ª
â™ª Just live life Spreading cheer while you doÂ â™ª
â™ª Life is short, make it countÂ â™ª
â™ª There's no problem That can't be surmountedÂ â™ª
â™ª Live your life unafraidÂ â™ª
â™ª Just give inÂ â™ª
â™ª â€˜Cause life's a wonderful thingÂ â™ª
â™ª For livingÂ â™ª
â™ª Life â™ª
â™ª Oh, yes, I likeÂ â™ª
â™ª Life! â™ª
Do you see the light?
Can you feel it, Scrooge?
Are you ready to live your life, now, in the present,
unencumbered by the weight of the past?
I'm ready.
I'm ready to go home. Thank you very much.
Oh, really?
But the fireworks. We did a whole song and everything.
Well, I'm not giving up on you yet, Ebenezer Scrooge.
Come on. Let's hit the town.
Hit the town? I'll hit something else in a minute.
Dragged from pillar to post in the middle of the night. Huh.
My friends, please. I-I would like to propose a toast.
My friends, please. Oh--
Oh, thank you.
He really is a buffoon, that boy.
There's no need to whisper.
No one can hear or see you.
-[Scrooge gasps] -Lucky them. [laughs]
Please raise your glass and drink to the good health and long life
of my celebrated uncle, Ebenezer Scrooge.
-[crowd mutter] -[woman] Boo.
I know. I know.
But I like old Scrooge.
-No, no, no. No. Come now. I do. I do. -[woman] Why?
Why?
I never met my mother, but my father spoke of her often.
Of her kindness. Her generosity.
It's hard to believe that the woman he described
was that old stick-in-the-mud's little sister. [chuckles]
But his sister she was.
And, by all accounts, she and my uncle were inseparable.
She loved him without reservation, and he, her.
So he can't be all bad.
I have to believe that somewhere in that loathsome old carcass of his,
the man my mother loved is fighting to get out.
I should like to meet him one day.
Which brings me to my next toast of the evening, to my beloved mother.
As I entered the world, you departed.
Here's to the Christmases we never shared, and the sad, short one we did.
Harry, my dear, sweet Harry, let's not dwell on the sadness in our past,
on those who cannot be with us.
-Or refuse to be. -[cheerling squeaks]
Instead, let us celebrate those who are here.
Hear! Hear!
Everyone, let us honor the past by toasting our present.
To each other. To Christmas.
-To friendship. -[man 1] Hear! Hear!
-[man 2] To friendship. -To friendship.
Oh, for goodness' sake, where are we going now?
[Present] May I present to you the beautiful home of Robert Cratchit Esquire.
He owes these sumptuous surroundings to the generosity of his employer.
I never knew Cratchit had quite so many children.
No? Did you ever ask him?
Mmm. Pure nectar. An elixir fit for Father Christmas himself.
The stuffing's ready, Father.
-[both] And the birdie is plucked. -Tremendous work, my dears.
Roast goose with sage and onion stuffing Ã  la Cratchit.
A legendary gourmet dish.
There's one problem. I'm not sure whether to stuff the goose with the stuffing,
There's one problem. I'm not sure whether to stuff the goose with the stuffing, or stuff the stuffing with the goose.
Come now, my love.
It is a lean Christmas, there's no denying that.
But we have each other and we have the children.
We can stillÂ make the most of it.
In fact, I do believe this will be the best Cratchit Christmas ever.
[children] Hooray!
Not another toast.
If you please, a toast to those whose generosity
have made possible tomorrow's sumptuous Christmas feast.
Master Timothy and Miss Katherine,
the Christmas-caroling Cratchits, of course.
And Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.
Oh! Scrooge?
What are you trying to do, spoil our Christmas?
But his money paid for the goose, my dear. No, your money paid for the goose.
-If you can even call that a goose. -But he paid me the money.
Because you earned it.
Believe me, you earned that money, Bob.
Mr. Scrooge assures me that times are hard, my dear.
Times are hard. For us, not him.
Nonetheless, he is the founder of our feast, and we should drink to him.
Hear! Hear!
The founder of our feast indeed.
I'd like to give him something to feast on.
He'd have indigestion all January.
[sighs] Children, we shall drink to your father.
For the love and happiness he brings us.
And to our Tiny Tim, for the health we wish him.
And, for the sake of your dear father,
I will even drink to that old miser, Mr. Scrooge.
Long life to him and to us all.
And a merry Christmas to us all.
[children] Merry Christmas!
God bless us.
God bless us, every one.
[children] Merry Christmas!
I think Bob Cratchit's rather fond of me.
So is his wife. Couldn't you tell? [chuckles]
And now, to the triumphant musical climax of this celebration.
Master Timothy, Miss Katherine, would you be so kind?
-No. -[children] Sing, sing!
Go on, love. Sing, sing!
It's embarrassing.
Sing!
I will if Kathy does.
â™ª On the beautiful day That I dream about â™ª
â™ª There's a world I would love to seeÂ â™ª
â™ª It's a beautiful place Where the sun comes outÂ â™ª
â™ª And it shines in the sky for meÂ â™ª
â™ª On this beautiful day That I dream about â™ª
â™ª There's no place I would rather beÂ â™ª
â™ª On this beautiful winter's morningÂ â™ª
â™ª If my wish could come true somehowÂ â™ª
â™ª Then the beautiful day That I dream about â™ª
â™ª Would be hereÂ â™ª
â™ª And nowÂ â™ª
Timmy.
Oh, just breathe. Slowly. That's it.
Oh, just breathe. Slowly. That's it. -That's it. -[Tim coughs]
Slowly.
Bob's boy, Tim.
What will become of him?
The future is as much a mystery to me as it is to you.
I can only show you what is.
What's to come if you do not change?
Well, that will soon be revealed byâ€¦ someone else.
[burps] Oh, excuse me.
Look, friend, there really is no great secret to any of this.
You just have to do the best you can with the time you have.
But you better get started soon.
Because before you know it, all that time you think you have
will run out.
[Jacob] The third, at 3:00.
Well, goodbye, Ebenezer Scrooâ€¦
Well, goodbye, Ebenezer Scrooâ€¦ Ooh! [chuckles]
Would you look at that?
-[Prudence whimpers] -I, uhâ€¦
We are no longer in the present.
This is the future.
This is what is yet to come.
Are you still in there, giant?
The fellow in the green robes? Liked life and so forth?
No.
You are something else entirely.
You don't speak?
Your colleagues were rather fond of speaking.
More than I would have liked.
So you are the one that will show me what awaits if I do not change my ways.
Yes?
So I should change, should I?
Why? Tell me.
I live my life as well as I can.
I have my faults, but who does not, truly?
Are all others I've been shown this night without blame?
Am I the only one with the power to change my life?
To change the lives of others?
Well? Am I?
Tell me!
Oh, very well.
Lead on.
Show me what bleak future my wickedness has wrought.
And, yes, nobody can see or hear me, I know.
[Tom Jenkins] Ladies and gentlemen,
good morning to you on this joyous Christmas Day.
We are gathered here as a group, united by a common bond.
Namely, our feelings of gratitude
to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.
-[crowd cheer] -I know that fellow.
Jenkins. Owes me 25â€¦ No, 50 pounds.
I must say he looks uncommonly happy for a man so deep in debt.
In fact, most of this rabble owes me money. Shush. Shush.
While we are all deeply moved,
those of us who Mr. S was so kind as to lend money to over the years
are particularly grateful for what he has done for us today.
-[crowd cheers] -What have I done? Certainly not forgiven their debts.
As your predecessor said, you are showing me what will happen if I do not change.
I did not change, yet I am celebrated.
And rightly so.
These creatures have finally come to their senses. That's it. Ha!
It would seem the ordeal to which I have been subjected
has been a complete waste of my time. And yours, my silent friend.
No matter. All's well that ends well, as they say.
[woman] â™ª For he's a jolly good fellowÂ â™ª
That's right, Prudence. They're cheering for me.
Yes.
â™ª For I'm a jolly good fellowÂ â™ª
Ladies and gentlemen.
â™ª On behalf of all the people Who have gathered here todayÂ â™ª
â™ª I would merely like to mention If I may â™ª
[Tom] â™ª That our unanimous attitudeÂ â™ª
â™ª Is one of lasting gratitudeÂ â™ª â™ª For what our friend Has done for us today â™ª
â™ª And thereforeÂ â™ª
â™ª I would simply like to sayÂ â™ª
â™ª Thank you very much Thank you very much â™ª
â™ª That's the nicest thing That anyone's ever done forÂ meÂ â™ª
â™ª I may sound double Dutch But my delight is suchÂ â™ª
â™ª I feel as if A losing war's been won for meÂ â™ª
â™ª And if I had a flag I'd hang me flag out â™ª
â™ª To add a sort of final victory touchÂ â™ª
â™ª But since I've left my flag at home I'll simply have to sayÂ â™ª
â™ª Thank you very, very, very muchÂ â™ª
â™ª Thank you very, very, very muchÂ â™ª
â™ª Thank you very much Thank you very much â™ª
â™ª That's the nicest thing That anyone's ever done for meÂ â™ª
â™ª It isn't every day Good fortune comes your wayÂ â™ª
â™ª I never thought The future would be fun for meÂ â™ª
â™ª And if I had a bugle, I would blow itÂ â™ª
â™ª To add a sort of How's-your-father touch â™ª
â™ª But since I left me bugle at home I'll simply have to sayÂ â™ª
â™ª Thank you very, very, very Very, very, very, very, very, very much â™ª
-[all] â™ª For he's a jolly good fellowÂ â™ª -â™ª For who's a jolly good fellow?Â â™ª
[all] â™ª He's a jolly good fellowÂ â™ª
â™ª And so say all of usÂ â™ª
â™ª [Tom] And if I had a drum I'd have to bang it â™ª
â™ª To add a sort of rumpty-tumpty touchÂ â™ª
â™ª But since I left my drum at home I'll simply have to sayÂ â™ª
â™ª Thank you very, very, very â™ª
-â™ª Much â™ª -[all] â™ª For he's a jolly good fellowÂ â™ª
Thank you very much!
Ha, ha! Oh, yes, indeed.
This is far more agreeable than what your predecessors had me endure.
So what's next, friend?
Tiny Tim.
-No. -It's all right.
Cratchit, times are hard, and my financial burdens are considerable.
-[Bob] My boy needs medicine. -[Cratchit Sr.] It's Christmas Eve.
-[Bob] My boy needs medicine. -[Cratchit Sr.] It's Christmas Eve. [Scrooge] Cratchit, you do nothing but trouble me.
Should I add to them by paying for the upkeep of your entire family?
I must go now, my little man.
I promised your mother I'd help with Christmas dinner, butâ€¦
I'll come and see you again tomorrow. Same time, all right?
[sobs] Oh, dear Tim.
-[Bob cries] -Come on now, Father.
Till tomorrow then. Sleep well, my love. Sweet dreams.
Iâ€¦
I could have done more.
I could have done something.
Poor Tiny Tim.
Friend, you have shown me a Christmas yet to come
that mixes great joy with greater sorrow.
Tell me, is this what will be,
or what may be?
If I were to change,
would all this still come to pass?
[man] Here.
-[Tom laughs] -Gentlemen, please. Sorry, Father. But you reap what you sow.
Is that not what your Good Book says?
I wouldn't hang about for any mourners. Nobody's sorry to see this one go.
Nobody who doesn't walk on all fours anyway.
Merry Christmas.
And thank you very much. [laughs]
[Tom sighs happily] Come on. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
[Jacob] Scroogeâ€¦
No.
No.
Spare me.
Let me return.
I will not become this man
whose death is the cause of such celebration.
Why show me this if I am past all hope?
Am I? Truly?
Ifâ€¦ If I am beyond salvation, then so be it.
But, please, the boy need not die.
Not when I have it in my power to help him.
I beg of you, spare me for this reason, if nothing more.
I swear to honor Christmas in my heart and keep it there the whole year through.
I will learn from the past, live only in the present,
and strive for a better future.
For all!
Tell me I may yetÂ strike the writing from the boy's cross.
Please.
Please, tell me!
No!
[Scrooge] No!
[Jen] â™ª The wish that you wish On Christmas Dayâ€¦ â™ª
[Isabel] â™ª Goodbyeâ€¦Â â™ª
[Tim] â™ª On the beautiful day That I dreamâ€¦ â™ª
[Scrooge] No! No! Please, no! No! Please, no!
[Scrooge] No! No!
Spare me! Spare me!
Please. Please!
[Scrooge] Prudence?
Prudence!
[gasps] I'm in my bedroom.
Oh, it's Prudence.
Well, was Iâ€¦ Was I merely dreaming?
-You there! -[man] Huh?
I-I say, what day is it, my fine fellow?
Um, Tuesday, I think.
Ha, no. Is it Christmas Day?
Well, of course it is.
[grunts] Takes all kinds, I suppose.
It's Christmas, Prudence! [laughs]
-[Prudence barks] -It's Christmas, and I'm alive! [laughs]
Wait, what time is it?
I'm glad Isabel found the happiness she deserved.
Perhapsâ€¦
Perhaps it's not too late for me to find my own.
-[sighs contentedly] -I did. I swear. I said-- -Hello there. -[girl] What?
What is it? We didn't do nothing, Mr. Scrooge.
No, not yet, you haven't. [laughs]
I have some errands for you to run. I can make it worth your while.
Errands?
Thank you, Prudence. There's a good girl. [boy 1] Ah, ah, ah, ahh!
Mind how you go.
[girl] Mr. Scrooge, sir.
Almost done.
Magnificent. What wonderful children you all are.
And, well, sorry to ask again,
but you're sure you managed to get everything on the list?
Yes, sir.
The butchers and the bakers thought I was having a laugh.
But then I gave 'em the checks. They'll be here soon.
Splendid. And you did deliver the invitations? All of them?
Of course.
No guarantee they'll come, though. It is very short notice.
[laughs] Quite. Uh, you are a clever young lady, aren't you?
As promised, a gold sovereign for each of you.
Boys, since it's Christmas, I ain't even gonna take my cut.
That's the spirit. And you'll all stay for dinner, won't you?
Won't you?
-[all] Yay! -[barking]
Ha! And help yourself to a gift.
[children] Yay!
-[boy 1] Come on. -[boy 2] I get the biggest one.
Ready, Prudence?
â™ª I'll begin againÂ â™ª
â™ª I will build my lifeÂ â™ª
â™ª I will live to knowÂ â™ª
â™ª That I've fulfilled my lifeÂ â™ª
â™ª I'll begin todayÂ â™ª
â™ª Throw away the pastÂ â™ª
â™ª And the future I buildÂ â™ª
â™ª Will be somethingÂ â™ª
â™ª That will lastÂ â™ª
-There we go. Comfortable enough, Ethel? -Yes. Much obliged, Mr. Scrooge.
Good, good, good. Oh, and please, call me Ebenezer.
-What's all this about then? -Tom, your debt is canceled.
Merry Christmas, my friend.
Oh, and give my best to your mother, won't you?
Thank you. Thank you very much.
[both] Oh, my giddy aunt!
Ladies, 1,000 pounds for your fund, this and every Christmas to come.
[both] Oh, such generosity.
It's the doll from my mother's picture. Uncle, I can't accept this.
You must.
It's a gift from an old fool who regrets all the Christmases we never shared.
[Harry] Oh, Uncle. [laughs] Thank you.
-"Business partners"? -Yes, Bob. If you'll have me, that is.
Let's build a brighter future for theÂ Cratchits together.
-What do you say? -[Bob] I say yes!
God bless you, Mr. Scrooge.
â™ª I will start anewÂ â™ª
â™ª I will make amends â™ª
â™ª And I'll make quite certain That the story endsÂ â™ª
â™ª On a note of hope, on a strong amenÂ â™ª
â™ª And I'll thank the world And remember when â™ª
â™ª I was able toÂ â™ª
â™ª Begin â™ª
[chuckles softly] And it says,
"My life, my career, my-- my dreamâ€¦ [whispers dramatically] â€¦my reality."
For a while, I wrote with quill and ink. That was a phase I went through. Like, I had a glass quill
That was a phase I went through. Like, I had a glass quill with, like, an ink jet.
You know, my entire moral code, as a kid and now,
is a need to be thought of as good.
That's dangerous. That's not-- That's dangerous for you.
It was all I wrote about. It was all I wanted.
It was the complete and totalâ€¦
belief system that I subscribed to as a kid.
Do the right thing. Do the good thing.
And obviously, I'm not a perfect person by any stretch,
but overall, the main thing that I always tried to be wasâ€¦
like, justâ€¦
like, a good girl.
[announcer] And now, to perform the national anthem,
a multitalented performing artist from Reading, Pennsylvania.
Please welcome Taylor Swift!
-[crowd cheers] -[teenage Taylor] Hey, everybody.
-Umâ€¦ -[man] Hi, Taylor.
-[all chuckle] -You know, one of my first memories of country music was when I was six years old,
one of my first memories of country music was when I was six years old,
and my parents took me to see LeAnn Rimes in concert.
[young Taylor] Guitar!
[breathing heavily] Iâ€¦amâ€¦
happy!
[announcer] â€¦twelve-year-old Taylor Swift! [woman] Whoo!
-Hey, everybody. I'm Taylor. -[crowd clapping]
[Taylor] I'd been trained to be happy when you get a lot of praise.
[woman] Hi, Taylor.
See, that's-- that's Sony Music, right there.
Sony is gonna listen to her CD today. [chuckles]
[Taylor] I had that praise of, "Taylor, you're doing a good job at your work."
Hey, this is Taylor Swift, and thanks for listening to Cat Country 98.1.
[Taylor] "You're doing a good job at being a songwriter.
You're doing a good job at being a musician."
Like, those pats on the head were all I lived for.
No one's going to be watching this 'cause it's my home video, butâ€¦
right here, look at that.
Look at that. Sixtyâ€¦
[chuckling] â€¦60 on the Billboard charts right there.
[Taylor] I was so fulfilled by approvalâ€¦ thatâ€¦
that was it.
[Taylor] I became the person who everyone wanted me to be.
-[Taylor] â™ª Are you ready for it?Â â™ª -[bass blasts]
[quietly] My God, man.
I'm soâ€¦
happy. [chuckles softly]
Everybody was so happy watching it.
[Taylor] Hey.
-Night. -[man] Good night.
-Hi. -[woman on speakerphone] Good morning.
I've just been, like, running up and down stairs,
like, moving things around, unpacking boxes, likeâ€¦
â€¦trying not to think about you calling me with Grammy nominations.
[woman] I know. Well, I'm trying to get the fullâ€¦ the full list.
Because right now, um, in the mainâ€¦ the big categories of album, record, songâ€¦
the big categories of album, record, songâ€¦
um, you are not nominated.
-And-- -Uh, okay, it's-- it's, umâ€¦ -This is good. This is fine. -[woman] Yeah.
-This is good. This is fine. -[woman] Yeah. [stammers] And it's very similar.
Everything is like this cr-- You know, it's so weird, I said--
If-- This isâ€¦ You know what? Like, this is fine.
-This isâ€¦ -[woman] Yeah.
I just need to make a better record.
[woman] Well, Reputation is a great record.
No, I'm makingâ€¦ I'm making a better record.
-[sighs softly] -[woman] Well, and I should--
I'm still waiting for the popâ€¦ you know, the pop categories.
Those should be hitting any second.
So, do you want me to call you right back when those hit?
Sure.
-[woman] Okay, I'll call you right back. -Okay, thanks.
-[woman] Bye, now. Bye! -[voice breaking] Bye.
[Taylor] It sounds different than I thought it would on the piano.
-Almost sounds sadder. -[Joel] Mm-hmm.
And I guess it's, likeâ€¦ The only thing I have--
I really have minimal stuff, but it's likeâ€¦ -[plays chord] -[Taylor hums]
â™ª So you say that--Â â™ª
And, likeâ€¦
â™ª And then you say â™ª â™ª That you'll never find another Like me-ee-eeÂ â™ª
â™ª Baby, that's the fun of meÂ â™ª
-I don't know. I have no idea. -[Joel] It's cool.
-You like it? -[Joel] Yeah.
[Taylor] I think this is the first single.
First verse, and, like, maybe a lower volume so you can hear
-what lyrics I'm trying to say. -Yeah.
-[drums continue] -[Taylor] â™ª I know I said some bullshit â™ª â™ª On the phone â™ª
â™ª I never leave well enough aloneÂ â™ª
â™ª And trouble's gonna follow where I go â™ª
â™ª And there's a lot of cool chicks Out there â™ª
â™ª One of these things Is not like the othersÂ â™ª
â™ª Like a rainbow with all of the colorsÂ â™ª
â™ª Baby doll, when it comes to a loverÂ â™ª
â™ª I tell you That you'll never find another â™ª -[laughing] -â™ª Like me-ee-ee! â™ª
-Yes! -[both] â™ª Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh! â™ª
-Yeah. -â™ª I'm the only one of meÂ â™ª
-[laughs] -Yeah, so good.
â™ª Baby, there's just one of me â™ª
-Damn. -Holy shit!
Oh, my God, did we just do, like, this whole verse and chorus?
[Joel] Yeah.
Holy shit.
[Joel] Everything up to that point is good. [Taylor laughing softly] Yep.
[Joel] You look like you might need a rest. -I don't need a rest. I'm fine. -[Joel chuckles]
This means it's working.
-[Andrea] Honey! How are you? Oh, honey! -[jet engines whirring]
[Andrea] Aw, hi, honey.
[Taylor] There's so much pressure going into putting new music out.
If I don't beat everything I've done prior,
it'll be deemed as, like, a colossal failure.
Maybe first I could talk to you about, um, kind of new album stuff.
There's gonna be fromâ€¦
from 16 to 20 songs on itâ€¦
is what I'm guessing it's gonna end up at. -[chuckles] It's a lot. -[assistant] Let's get it done.
That's what-- that's what I was hoping for.
[Taylor] Everybody in music has their own sort ofâ€¦ niche specialty thing that they doâ€¦
that, you know, sets them apart from everybody else.
Andâ€¦ my storytelling is what it is for me.
I-Iâ€¦ I know that, without me writing my own songs,
I wouldn'tâ€¦ be here.
â™ª We canâ€¦Â â™ª [sighs]
â™ª We can leave the Christmas--Â â™ª -Uh. -[stops playing]
â™ª We can leave the Christmas lights up Till Januaryâ€¦ â™ª
[Taylor] There is an element to my fan base where we feel like we grew up together.
I'll-- I'll be going through something, write the album about it,
and then it'll come out, andâ€¦
sometimes it'll just coincide with what they're going through.
Kind ofâ€¦
Kind of like they're reading my diary.
â™ª ...Close forever and ever?Â â™ª â™ª And, ah, take me outÂ â™ª
â™ª And, ah, take me outÂ â™ª
â™ª And take me homeÂ â™ª
â™ª You're my, my, my, myÂ â™ª
â™ª LoverÂ â™ª
Okay.
This is a song I wrote yesterday,
andâ€¦ it's about a girl who's just different.
And I really like it because it's just s-so happy.
-So, this is called "Lucky You." -[strums guitar]
I have to be honest with you, this song was seriously finished
I have to be honest with you, this song was seriously finished five minutes ago.
So, you know, I usually have these things memorized,
butâ€¦ I just finished it five minutes ago, soâ€¦
IÂ started playing guitar and wrote a couple songs,
and I've written 150 songs and written every song on this album, soâ€¦
[DJ] You were a freshman when you wrote this?
I actually came up with the concept for it in math class my freshman year.
You know, I've had a single out now for about a month.
-[crowd cheers] -[man] Yeah!
-There's this radio station called KZLA. -[crowd whoops]
I want each and every one of you to call 'em upâ€¦
and tell 'em you wanna hear a song called "Tim McGraw"
by this girl named Taylor Swift.
-Please. -[crowd laughs]
A 16-year-old girl released her debut country music album
and dreamed of making it big.
Well, today that girl is as big as it gets.
In the past year, she has taken Nashville
and country music on an unforgettable trip around the world.
[Ellen DeGeneres] She went on to sell more than any artist this year.
[reporter] That made her the youngest person
to write and perform a number one country song.
I give myself, like, five seconds a day to be like, "Yes, this is happening!"
-[group laughs] -And then the rest of the day,
I'm trying to figure out how I'm gonna make it last.
[Carrie Underwood] And the Horizon Award goes toâ€¦
Taylor Swift!
-â™ª When you think happinessâ€¦ â™ª -[voice breaking] I wanna thank Godâ€¦
and my family for moving to Nashville
so that I could do this.
And the fansâ€¦
-you have changed my life! -["Our Song" playing]
Thank you so much.
â™ª In the front seat of his carÂ â™ª â™ª He's got a one-hand feel On the steering wheelÂ â™ª
[Taylor] I was in country music, and I was doing, like,
[Taylor] I was in country music, and I was doing, like, a very spectacle-type live show,
and I remember thinking, "This feels like a dream. This feels like a dream. This feels like a dream."
[Taylor] But when you're living for the approval of strangersâ€¦
and that is where you derive all of your joy and fulfillment,
one bad thing can cause everything to crumble.
[announcer] There's only one lady that can actually make an arrival
as angelic and as beautiful as this.
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Taylor Swift.
And the Moonman for Best Female Video goes toâ€¦
Taylor Swift.
-[audience cheering] -Thank you so much!
I always dreamed about what it would be like
to maybe win one of these someday,
but I never actually thought that would happen.
Uh, I sing country music, so thank you so much
for giving me a chance to win a VMA Award, Iâ€¦
Yo, Taylorâ€¦
I-I'm really happy for you. I'mma let you finish,
but BeyoncÃ© had one of the best videos of all time!
[Kanye West] One of the best videos of all time!
[Taylor] I was standing onstage,
and I was really excited because I had just won the award,
and then I was really excited because Kanye West was on the stage.
And then I, umâ€¦
then I wasn't so excited anymore.
[reporter] Hey, Taylor, are there any hard feelings towards him?
I-I don't know him, and I-I've never met him, soâ€¦
-[reporter] So, were you a fan before? -Umâ€¦
-[chuckles] â€¦yeah. -[reporter] Oh.
-He's Kanye West. -[reporter] Mm-hmm.
Are you still a fan? I take it no?
You know, I justâ€¦ I don't know him, and I don't wanna start anything
'cause I just, you know, I had a great night tonight.
Everyone is talking about this Kanye West thing, aren't they?
In case you're lucky enough to have missed it, Kanye West interrupted a young singer
to have missed it, Kanye West interrupted a young singer named Taylor Swift while sheâ€¦
President Obama calling Kanye West a "jackass."
I can name you ten or 15 people
that he wouldn't have gone up and taken that mic away from.
But he did it with a 17-year-old girl because he could.
[Taylor] It was so echoey in there.
At the time, I didn't know they were booing him doing that.
I thought that they were booing me.
For someone who's built their whole belief system
on getting people to clap for you,
the whole crowd booingâ€¦
is a prettyâ€¦
formative experience.
[Taylor] â™ª I walked through the door With you â™ª
[Taylor] That was, like, sort of a catalyst for a lot of psychologicalâ€¦
paths that I went down.
And not all of them wereâ€¦ beneficial.
[Taylor] It was all fueled by not feeling like I belonged there.
I'm only here because I work hard and I'm nice to people. â™ª That magic's not here no moreâ€¦ â™ª
[Taylor] That work ethic, likeâ€¦ -Thank God I had that work ethic. -â™ª But I'm not fine at all... â™ª
[Taylor] Like, I can't change what's gonna happen to me,
but I can control what I write.
-â™ª You took a Polaroid of usâ€¦ â™ª -[Taylor] I really just went to this place where I was like, "I'm gonna prove myself.
I'm gonna make sure people know I deserve to be here."
[Jimmy Kimmel] The New York Times said, "By making pop with almost no contemporary references,
Miss Swift is aiming somewhere even higher,
a mode of timelessness few pop stars even bother aspiring to."
Taylor Swift has done something only The Beatles have done:
an album at number one for six weeks
for four consecutive albums.
[Barbara Walters] One magazine headline said it best:
"Taylor Swift is the music industry."
[Taylor] That wasâ€¦ that was it.
My life had never been better.
[announcer] Taylor Swift.
[Taylor] I had won Album of the Year at the Grammys for a second time,
which I never thought was a possibility.
And I remembered thinking afterwardâ€¦
"Oh, my God, that was all you wanted.
Oh, God, that was all you wanted.
That was all you focused on."
You get to the mountaintop and you look around,
and you're like, "Oh, God. W-What now?"
I want to thank the fans for the last ten yearsâ€¦
and the Recording Academyâ€¦
[Taylor] I-I didn't have a partner that I climbed it with
-that I could, like, high-five. -[tense piano music playing]
I-I didn't have anyone I could talk to who could relate to what I was-- what-- what I-- you know?
I had my mom,
butâ€¦ I just wonderedâ€¦
"Shouldn't-- shouldn't Iâ€¦
shouldn't I have someone that I could call right now?"
-Do you eat burritos? -[Joel chuckling] Yes.
-Do you? -[Joel] Of course I eat burritos.
-Some people don't. -[Joel] Who doesn't eat burritos?
Um, I didn't ever eat burritos until, like, two years ago.
[Joel] Oh, wowâ€¦
I had never tri-- I just had never tried one.
-[Joel] That's the weirdest niche thing. -Yeah.
-[vocalizing] -You ever do this?
-For crunch? -No.
-[Joel chuckles] -That's spicy.
-[Joel] Okay. -Oh, my God.
I'm about to be 29.
[Joel] Twenty-nine? I remember those days.
How do you feel about that?
[Taylor] I meanâ€¦
yeah, there's a part of me that feels like I'm 57,
but there's a part of me that's likeâ€¦
definitely not ready to have kids,
definitely not ready for all this grown-up stuff.
-[Joel] Yeah. -Soâ€¦
[Joel] I don't think anybody's ever ready for that stuff.
[chuckling] You just figure it out when it happens.
I kind of don't really have the luxury ofâ€¦ [swallows]
â€¦figuring stuff out because my life is planned, like, inâ€¦
â€¦figuring stuff out because my life is planned, like, inâ€¦ -like, two years ahead of time. -[Joel] Mm.
Like, literally, in two months,
they'll come to me with the dates for the next tour.
-[Joel] Right. -They'll be like, "Soâ€¦
you'll be at Foxborough Stadium, this date, 2020," or whatever year, you know?
this date, 2020," or whatever year, you know?
-Like, it'sâ€¦ -[Joel] Wow. Yeah.
So, yeah. [sighs]
Ooh! You scared the shit out of me!
Here we go.
-Incoming. -Yup.
-[silverware clattering] -I got it.
-Whoa. Oh. -Oh, no! -[Andrea grunts] -No!
-Not the steak! -[snickers]
No, no, not on your forehead!
Yeah, well, I don't know. I-- Either that or the lap. I don't know.
-[Andrea laughs] Oh, shit. -This is a Rihanna shirt.
[Andrea] Oh, my God, it's all over me.
[chuckles] Want a bite?Â Want a bite?
She goes, "What is the panic?"
She did a better job of bracing herself for takeoff than we did.
[Taylor] It is like traveling with a pony.
But I love her.
-Oh, I know. -[chuckles] But I love her.
[Taylor] She's-- Okay, so what you'reâ€¦ what you're seeing hereâ€¦ isâ€¦
[stammers] â€¦is exactly what Mom decided to do
when both of her kids were out of the house.
She decided to get a third child, like, a human-sized dog.
[Andrea] She's actually my cancer dog.
After Iâ€¦ found that out, Iâ€¦
I decided to, umâ€¦
to do something I'd always wanted to do, which wasâ€¦
get a-a really big dog.
-That's good, Mom. -Yeah. Well, that's what it is.
I'm happy that worked out for you. I'm sor--sorry you had cancer.
[chuckling] I'm sorry. That's really what it is.
[Taylor] She got cancer several years ago.
That has been really hard for me
-because she's my favorite person. -[both speaking indistinctly]
On the third song, where I hadn't gotten it started yet,
she goes, "Come on, Mom."
Like, into the microphone.
[Taylor] It woke me up from thisâ€¦
this life where I used to sweat all these things.
-[Taylor] Hi, Dad. -How you doing, babe?
[Taylor] But, like, do you really care
if the Internet doesn't like you today
if your mom's sick from her chemo?
-She looks like you. -Oh, she's just like you, Kitty!
[Taylor] You gotta be able to really prioritize what matters to you.
For me, it's my family and my friends.
This is looking good, right now.
Would you like a glass of red wine or white wine?
Can I get some white wine? Oh, you got the red wine?
-Does that make me a difficult guest? -[Taylor] It's for the recipe. I'm happy to switch. It's too adult for me,
I'm happy to switch. It's too adult for me, -let's be honest. -[Abigail] Yeah.
Andâ€¦ ah, yes.
[Taylor] I'm gonna get some ice for my wine. You want any?
[Abigail] Yeah.
Oh, that's fine. That's honestly just what I wanted.
-Yeah. -[chuckles] You're likeâ€¦ "Uhâ€¦ "
-You know, Claire just had a baby. -[Abigail] Mm-hmm.
And, like, I went over to see her, andâ€¦
[Abigail] How's she doingâ€¦ -She was justâ€¦ -â€¦with motherhood?
[chuckling] Well, she's the bestÂ 'cause she's like, -"Just so you know, this is what it is. -[Abigail chuckles]
-You feed 'em, change 'em, they sleep. -[Abigail] Yeah.
-You feed 'em, change 'em, they sleep. -[Abigail] You do it all over. Yeah.
-You feed 'em." Likeâ€¦ -[Abigail] It's justâ€¦
She's-- And I was like, "So, it's like a Tamagotchi?"
-[Abigail laughs] Oh, my God. -[chuckles] Like--
-Like, exactly, soâ€¦ -[Taylor] Yeah.
-[Abigail] You'd be an excellent mother. -[chuckles] Thanks.
[Abigail] No questions.
-[Taylor laughs] -[Abigail] Mmm. Mmm. This is so good.
-[Taylor] I'm gone for a month after this. -[Abigail] Mm.
-[assistant 1] We got three. -[assistant 2] Okay.
[assistant 2] Three paps. -[Taylor] Three? -[assistant 2] Three paps now.
-[Taylor] Three? -[assistant 2] Three paps now. [Taylor] Three of 'em, you say?
-Well, good luck sellin' this picture. -[assistants laugh]
-[crowd clamoring] -[fan 1] Oh, my God!
Wellâ€¦
-So, this is my front yardâ€¦ -[seat belt clicks]
â€¦andâ€¦ I'm highly aware of the fact that that is not normal.
I've learned over the yearsâ€¦
[gulps] â€¦it's not good for me to see pictures of myself every day
'cause I have a tendency,
and it's only happenedâ€¦
a few times, and I'm not in any way proud of it,
but I getâ€¦
I tend to get triggered by something, whether it's a picture of me
I tend to get triggered by something, whether it's a picture of me where I feel like I looked like my tummy was too big
orâ€¦ or, like, someone said that I looked pregnant or something,
and that'll just trigger me to justâ€¦
s-starve a little bit, just stop eating.
I thought that I was just, like, supposed to feel like I was gonna pass out
I thought that I was just, like, supposed to feel like I was gonna pass out at the end of a show or in the middle of it.
I thought that was how it was,
and now I realize:
no, if you eat food, have energy, get stronger,
you can do all these shows and not feel it.
Which isâ€¦ [sighs] â€¦a really good revelationâ€¦
because I'm a lot happier with who I am, and I'm happier with, likeâ€¦
I don'tâ€¦
I don't care as much if, likeâ€¦
somebody points out that I have gained weight.
It's just something that makes my life better,
the fact that I'm, you knowâ€¦
I'm a size six instead of a size double zero.
I mean, that-- that wasn'tâ€¦ how my body was supposed to be.
I just didn't reallyâ€¦
understand that a-at the time. I really don't think I knew it.
[Taylor] I would've defended it to anyone who said, "I'm concerned about you."
I was like, "What are you talking about? Of course I eat.
It's perfectly normal. I just exercise a lot."
And I did exercise a lot, but I wasn't eating.
Andâ€¦
you can'tâ€¦ [sighs]
I justâ€¦
I don't think you know you're doing that when you're doing it gradually.
[Taylor] There's always some standard of beauty that you're not meeting.
'Cause if you're thin enough
then you don't have that ass that everybody wants.
But if you have enough weight on you to have an ass,
then your stomach isn't flat enough.
It's all justâ€¦
fucking impossible. [scoffs]
You don't ever say to yourself, "Look, I've got an eating disorder,"
but you know you're, like, making a list of everything you put
but you know you're, like, making a list of everything you put in your mouth that day, and you know that's probably not right,
in your mouth that day, and you know that's probably not right,
but then again,Â there's so many diet blogs that tell you that thatâ€¦
that that's what you should do.
This would cause me to go into, like, a real shameâ€¦
like, hate spiral.
This.
And, like, I caught myself yesterday starting to do it, and I was like,
"Nope, we don't do that anymore. We do not do that anymore,
because it's better to look-- to think you look fat than to look sick.
And we don't do that anymore, and you justâ€¦
We're justâ€¦ We're changing the channel in our brain,
and we're notâ€¦ we're not doin' that anymore.
That didn't end us up in a good place."
As your career goes like this, the magnifying glass goes like that.
Taylor Swift could not take herself more seriously.
I think that there's plenty of annoying women.
I-I think that Taylor Swift, she is annoying.
[Nikki Glaser] She's too good. She's too skinny. It bothers me.
All of her model friends. And it's just like, come on!
[man 1] Lock and load, boys.
[man 2]Â Yo, Taylor! You fucked him, Taylor?
[presenter] We've got a roundup of the guys that Miss Swifty has
[presenter] We've got a roundup of the guys that Miss Swifty has at one point been romantic with,
and there are a lot of hotties on this list.
Holy date life.
[man 3] ...meet the parents? She's going through guys like a train.
She's going through guys like a train.
-Can we get a pan down? -[reporter 1] It's beautiful.
[reporter 2] I wanted to show the legs, 'cause as I was telling you,
you're gonna walk home with more than maybe just a trophy tonight.
I think lots of men.
I'm not gonna walk home with any men tonight.
[man 4] Watch-- watch out, guys!
We give you the latest can't-look-away twist
in one of America's favorite celebrity feuds.
[reporter 3] Kanye West recently dissed Taylor in his new song, "Famous."
The song contains a lyric calling Taylor Swift the b-word.
[Kanye] â™ªI feel like me and Taylor Might still have sex â™ª
â™ª Why? I made that bitch famous â™ª
Kanye had said all along that he got permission. Taylor denied it.
[reporter 4] Kim Kardashian released video of Kanye West
secretly recording his conversation.
[Kanye] I mean, thanks for being, like, so cool about it.
-[Taylor on speakerphone] Oh, thanks. -[Kanye] Yeah.
[Taylor] Um, yeah, I really appreciate it. Like, the heads-up is so nice.
She posted on Instagram, "Where in the video is Kanye telling me
he was gonna call me 'thatâ€¦ -biatch' in his song?" -[Joy Behar] Yeah.
[reporter 5] Swift writing, "I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative,
one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009."
I don't buy the story that she was so insulted by that one line.
I think she saw an opportunity to be victimized here,
and she thought everybody was gonna get on her side.
[Kanye] â™ª I feel like me and Taylor Might still have sex, why?Â â™ª
[crowd] â™ªÂ I made that bitch famous â™ª
-[Kanye] â™ª God damn!Â â™ª -[crowd] â™ª I made that bitch famousÂ â™ª
[Kanye] Hold on.
[Taylor] When people decided I wasâ€¦
wicked and evil and conniving
wicked and evil and conniving and notâ€¦ a good person,
and notâ€¦ a good person,
that was the one that I couldn't really bounce back from
'cause my whole life was centered around it.
#TaylorSwiftIsOverParty was the number one trend on Twitter worldwide.
Know how many people have to be tweeting that they hate you for that to happen?
We're people who got into this line of work
because we wanted people to like us,
'cause we were intrinsically insecure,
because we liked the sound of people clapping
'cause it made us forget how much we feel like we're not good enough.
And I've been doing this for 15 years, and it's just, I'm tired of it.
[voice breaking] I'm just tired of theâ€¦
[inhales sharply] ...justâ€¦
[crying] ...it just feels like it's more than music now at this point.
And, just, most days, I'm like, "Okay."
But then sometimes, I'm just likeâ€¦
...it just gets loud sometimes.
[Taylor] When people fall out of love with you,
there's nothing you can do to make them change their mind.
They just don't love you anymore.
I just wanted to disappear.
Nobody physically saw me for a year.
And that was what I thought they wanted.
â™ª The world moves on Another day, another drama, dramaÂ â™ª
â™ª But not for me, not for me All I think about is karmaÂ â™ª
â™ª And then the world moves on But one thing's for sureÂ â™ª
â™ª Maybe I got mine But you'll all get yoursÂ â™ª
-[playing "I Did Something Bad" on piano] -[vocalizing]
[Taylor] The reason why that backlash hurt so much
was because that used to be all I had.
â™ª I never trust a narcissist But they love meÂ â™ª
â™ª So I play 'em like a violin And I make it look oh so easyÂ â™ª
â™ª If you've been on my case For a long time â™ª
[Taylor] I felt really alone. I felt really bitter.
I felt, you know, sort of like a wounded animal lashing out.
-[playing "King of My Heart"] -â™ª Is this the end of all the endings? â™ª
â™ª My broken bones are mendingÂ â™ª
â™ª With all these nights we're spending Up on the roofÂ â™ª
[Taylor] I figured I had to reset everything.
â™ª My castle crumbled overnightÂ â™ª
â™ª Brought a knife to a gunfightÂ â™ª
â™ª They took the crown But it's all right â™ª
â™ª All the liars are calling me oneÂ â™ª
â™ª Nobody's heard from me for monthsÂ â™ª
â™ª Doin' better than I ever wasâ€¦Â â™ª
[Taylor] I had to deconstruct an entire belief system
for my own personal sanity.
I also was falling in love with someone
who had a really wonderfully normal, balanced, grounded life.
And we decided together that we wanted our relationship to be private.
â™ª Call it what you want â™ª â™ª Yeah, call it what you want to â™ª
â™ª All my flowers grew back as thornsÂ â™ª
â™ª Windows boarded up after the stormÂ â™ª
â™ª He built a fire just to keep me warmÂ â™ª
â™ª And I know I make the same mistakes Every timeÂ â™ª
â™ª Bridges burn, I never learnÂ â™ª
â™ª At least I did one thing rightÂ â™ª
[laughing] â™ª I did one thing rightÂ â™ª
â™ª I'm laughing with my lover Making forts under covers â™ª
â™ª Trust him like a brother Yeah, you know I did one thing rightÂ â™ª
â™ª Starry eyes sparkin' up My darkest nights â™ª
â™ª Call it what you want Yeah, call it what you want toÂ â™ª
â™ª My baby's fit like a daydreamÂ â™ª
[chuckling] I love you.
â™ª Call it what you want Yeah, call it what you wantÂ â™ª
[Taylor] Even though it was really horrible, -I was happy. -[laughs]
[Taylor] But I wasn't happy in the way that I'd been trained to be happy.
[Taylor] It was happiness withoutâ€¦
anyone else's input.
-[playing "Gorgeous"] -It was justâ€¦ we were happy.
[Taylor] â™ª You should take it As a compliment â™ª
â™ª That I got drunk And made fun of the way you talkÂ â™ª
â™ª You should think about the consequenceÂ â™ª
â™ª Of your magnetic field Being a little too strongÂ â™ª
â™ª This ain't for the bestÂ â™ª
â™ª My reputation's never been worse Soâ€¦ â™ª
â™ª You must like me for meÂ â™ª
[Taylor] I'm gonna go back to doing my job, and I'm gonna make a record I'm proud of.
â™ª We can't make any promises now Can we, babe?Â â™ª
â™ª But you can make me a drinkÂ â™ª
-[man] Perfect. [vocalizes] -[Taylor] It's really cool.
[Taylor's voice on stereo] â™ª This ain't for the best â™ª â™ª But my reputation's Never been worse, so â™ª
-Can I have it again? -[Max] Um, yeah.
-[plays random notes] -[Taylor laughing hysterically]
[Jack] Time to do vocals. What are you doing?
-I'm turning on my party shoes for vocals. -[Jack] Good.
We've never really gotten a good take without them, have we?
No.
-["Getaway Car" playing on piano] -â™ª We were jet-set â™ª â™ª Bonnie and Clyde, oh, ohÂ â™ª
[shouting] â™ª Till I switched to the other side...Â â™ª
Like a Dylan-y kind of thing.
[singing as normal] â™ª No surprise I turned you in, oh, oh â™ª
[Taylor and Jack] â™ª 'Cause us traitors never win â™ª
â™ª I'm in a getaway carÂ â™ª
â™ª And I'm losin' myâ€¦Â â™ª
Something.
-â™ª Think about theâ€¦ â™ª -[Taylor] It's uhâ€¦
[Taylor and Jack] â™ª I'm in a getaway car â™ª
[Taylor] â™ª And-- and you'reÂ Â â™ª -â™ª You're in the motel bar â™ª -â™ª Where is it? â™ª
-[Taylor] Or, like-- -Yeah, "I'm in the getaway car.
Left you in the motel bar, took the moneyâ€¦"
-[Taylor] "Took the money in the bag--" -"Took the money."
"Put the money in the bag, I stole the keys.
That was the last time you ever saw me!" [exclaims]
-[man] That was awesome. -Thank you.
-[man] Awesome, awesome. -Oh, my gosh.
-That was so fun! -So much fun. So much fun.
Oh, my God.
-That was amazing. -[man] Yeah.

[fan 6] I'd just like you to be a witness for something special,
-Miss Taylor Swift. -Oh, my God.
Uh, I'm gonna ask MissÂ Maybelle Marciano, uh, to be my wife.
And I got this special token of my love and appreciation for you.
-Love you. -I-I love you.
Wow! Oh, my God.
Did you know that was gonna ha--? -[stammers] -No.
I didn't know that was gonna happen at all.
I was, like-- you just, likeâ€¦ High-five.
-[laughs] Thank you. -You guys engaged now?
-This is--? This-- -Yes, it's official.
-Oh, my God. That's amazing. -Yes. [sighs happily]
[chuckles] Bye, guys. Congratulations.
-[couple] Thank you. -[Taylor] Whoa!
â™ª Never find anotherÂ â™ª -â™ª 'Nother like me-ee â™ª -Mm! [beatboxing]
-Yeah. Ooh. -[continues vocalizing]
-Boom. -â™ª Never, never â™ª -â™ª Never find another like me-ee-ee â™ª -â™ª Ee â™ª
Oh, my God.
Like, I just want little kids to be like, "There's no one like me."
-Likeâ€¦ â™ª Whoo-hoo-hoo! â™ª -That's theâ€¦ exactly.
[Taylor] Do you think that you wanna stay in LA forever?
-I don't know, actually. -Yeah.
My wife is from Detroit.
So, we talked about getting a place to test it out.
And then fans found out, and I had to leave.
Oh, would they-- would they just wait outside?
They would jump the gate and, like, try to open our front door.
-And I was like, "This is not okay." -[Taylor] Yeah, let's not do that. Yeah.
There's a difference between "I connect with your lyrics"
-and "I'm going to break in." -[Brendon] And "I want your blood."
-[chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. -[Brendon laughs]
I had a crazy dude break into my apartment and sleep in my bed a couple months ago.
-[Brendon] Oh, what? -Didn't like it.
-Well, you can have that apartment. -[both laugh]
Oh, there it is. There's that middle.
I cannot believe you're even sick. -That's amazing. -[Brendon laughs]
The-There are stars next to yourâ€¦ your lines.
[Brendon clears throat, sniffles] Okay, cool.
â™ª Strike the band up, a-one, two, threeÂ â™ª
Oh, you sound fuckin' great, man. -You sound amazing! -[Brendon vocalizes] Oof.
â™ª I know I tend to make it about meÂ â™ª
â™ª I know you never get just what you see â™ª
â™ª But I will never bore you, babyÂ â™ª
Maybe your intr-- your first line should be, like...
â™ª I know I tend to make it about meÂ â™ª
-[Brendon] Mm. -[Taylor] Likeâ€¦ you know what I mean?
â™ª About meÂ â™ª
-Like... â™ª About me â™ª -[Brendon] Okay, cool.
-Brendon, you're blowin' it! -[Taylor] You sound amazing.
Like, you're making it come alive.
-[Taylor on recording] â™ª Ee-ee-ee â™ª -â™ª I know I tend to make it about meâ€¦Â â™ª
-[Joel] There it is. -â™ª Know you never get just what you see â™ª
â™ª But I will never bore you, babyÂ â™ª
[quietly] â™ª And there's a lot of lame guys Out there â™ª
-[Joel] Yes. -Sick.
-Oh, my God. -[Brendon] Thank you so much.
-This is ridiculous. -[Brendon] That was cool.
-It sounds so fun. Like, it's so fun. -And you're the pro-est pro of all time
-It sounds so fun. Like, it's so fun. -And you're the pro-est pro of all time for doing this.
No way. Thank you, guys. This is so cool.
-This is, likeâ€¦ I mean, I'mâ€¦ -Really good track.
...and I'm also really so excited you're down to do, like, a massive video.
-Oh, yeah. That's gonna be a biggie. -'Cause it's not gonna be a small one.
-[laughs] Well, it's gonna be so fun. -[Taylor] Umâ€¦
My idea that I had in the beginning is, like,it starts in an apartment.
Like, you and me get in a big fight.
-[speaking French] -I storm out, and I'm, likeâ€¦
And then all of a sudden, like, I have, like, a parade happening below.
Amazing, amazing.
-And, like, whatever makes you youâ€¦ -Yeah.
â€¦you know, it's just, like, emo kids,
theater,
dance sequences,
-La La Land, everything. -Nailed it!
And, like, when it's like, "me-ee-ee," it's like, dancers, cats,
gay pride, people in country western boots.
I start riding a unicorn, like, justâ€¦
-everything that makes me me. -[laughing] Yes!
[choreographer] Five, six, seven, eight.
[Taylor] If you were to split open my imagination, what would come out of it?
-Oh, it's so fun. -[Taylor] I'm sweating now.
-[laughs] Just like me. Oh, my God. -I got way too excited.
-Okay, guys. Oh, my God. -[Joel] I got something.
[Taylor] Too excited about everything. I feel like I'm justâ€¦
[Brendon chuckles] This is so cool.
-[Taylor] Uh, should I just follow you? -[assistant] Yes.
[Taylor] Just a curious cat in a-- in a big world.
I really, really care about my home state,
and I know that in thisâ€¦
at this point in time, like,
my home state is a huge, hugely important part of this midterm election.
[newscaster 1] Tennessee's US senate race figures to be crucial
in both parties' efforts to try to control the US Senate after this year.
[newscaster 2] Marsha Blackburn, a self-described hard-core conservative,
proclaims her support for President Trump often.
I know the left calls me "a wingnut" or "a knuckle-dragging conservative."
And you know what? I say, "That's all right. Bring it on."
[Taylor] One of the things that, like, outraged me so much is that she voted against the reauthorization
is that she voted against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act,
which tries to protect women from stalking,
from date rape, from domestic violence.
And then, obviously, it's a no for gay marriage,
it's a no for them to have any rights whatsoever.
I think I'll be really upset... if people think that Tennesseeâ€¦
stands for those things.
[interviewer] You've been very secretive about how you vote,
what you're voting for.
Well, I mean, I just figure, I'm a 22-year-old singer,
and, you know, I don't know
if people really want to hear my political views.
I think they kind of just want to hear me sing songs -about breakups and feelings. -[audience laughs]
[Taylor] Part of the fabric of being a country artist
is, "Don't force your politics on people.
Let people live their lives."
That is grilled into us.
These three women have been the reigning queens
of pop and country music.
They're the biggest-selling female artists of all time,
nearly 30 million records sold and even more fans
who always used to love their high-spirited style,
their music, and their moxie.
Well, that racy magazine cover on the stands today
pretty much sums up some of the names
the Dixie Chicks are being called in America these days:
"traitors, the Dixie Sluts, anti-American,"
all because of one split-second comment
aimed at President Bush right before the war with Iraq.
Their opinion is so ignorant.
They don't know what they're talking about.
[commentator] I think they are the Ditzy Twits.
These are the dumbest, dumbest bimbos, with due respect, I have seen.
These are callow, foolish women who deserve to be slapped around.
Absolutely.
[Taylor] Throughout my whole career,
label executives and publishers would just say,
"Don't be like the Dixie Chicks."
-And... I loved the Dixie Chicks. -[crowd cheering and whistling]
[Taylor] But a nice girl doesn't force their opinions on people.
A nice girl smiles and waves and says thank you.
A nice girl doesn't make people feel uncomfortable with her views.
It's my right to vote,
but it's not my right to tell other people what to do.
-Right there, sister. -Yes, thank you.
-Come on. Come on. Come on! -All right.
I was so obsessed with not getting in trouble,
that I was like,
"I'm just not gonna do anything that anyone could say anything about."
I'm just gettingâ€¦ I'm justâ€¦
I'm getting to the point where I can'tâ€¦
listen to people telling me, "No, stay out of it. Stay out of it."
-Yeah. Is that right? C to the A minor? -Yeah.
Let me-- just-- Can you not play for one second? 'Cause I'm trying to figure out this-- I like what I was doing,
'Cause I'm trying to figure out this-- I like what I was doing, but I can't figure out what key it was in.
It's like 4:00 a.m., in the middle of the night.
Maybe it's like, "I'm so sick of running as fast as I can,
wondering if I'd get much further if I were a man."
Is it, "If I was a man"? "If IÂ was a man."
-Fine. "If I was." -"If I was a man."Â "If I was a man." "If I was a man."
-â™ª If I was a manÂ â™ª -[playing "The Man"]
â™ª Hey, then, I'd be the man â™ª
â™ª I'd be the manÂ â™ª
-I actually really love that. -Yeah.
[chuckles] I really like that a lot.
Do you wanna start-- Maybe if you start a vibeâ€¦
-Yeah. -â€¦then this'll just write itself.
It must be so exhausting.
You must have to be thinking about this shit all the fucking time.
You are kind of doing a constant strategy in your head
as to how not to be shamed for something... -[Joel] Yeah. -...on any given day.
But then you get accused of being calculated
-for having a strategy. -[Joel] Mm.
-So, it's likeâ€¦ -[Joel] It's just a lose-lose situation.
Yeah, it'sâ€¦
I mean, I'm good, but it's been, uhâ€¦
You sort of do have to twist yourself into a pretzel -on an hourly basis. -[Joel] Mm. Mm-hmm.
Do you like this for a second verse?
Lyric: "They'd say I hustled, put in the work,
instead of shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve.
And what was I wearing, or if I was rude.
Could all be separated fromâ€¦
applauding business I could doâ€¦"
"Applaudingâ€¦
when I'd make a moveâ€¦"
-[Joel] That soundsâ€¦ -Let's sing a bit.
â™ª Could all be separated From my good ideas and power movesÂ â™ª
[Joel] Yeah, I like "good ideas."
-[electronic beat playing on computer] -[Taylor] That's it.
[sings tune with upbeat rhythm] Just more movement.
That's really cool.
-[Joel] Sick. -This is so fun to write.
â™ª We'd drink to the pen and the bottles To the bitches and modelsÂ â™ª
Like, do you know what I mean? [continues vocalizing]
â™ª To the bitches and models To theâ€¦Â â™ª
D-Do you know how they're likeâ€¦
"D-- We drink and we be poppin' bottles to the--
We'd be poppin' bottles to the bitches and models,
-to the hoes and theâ€¦" -[Joel chuckles]
Do you know? 'Cause they get to call us that.
-They get to fuckin' call us that. Likeâ€¦ -[Joel] Yeah.
[reporter 1] Taylor Swift the singer, she goes to court today
against a former radio DJ she says once groped her.
[reporter 2] Swift says this picture shows the moment Mueller inappropriately grabbed her, putting his hand up her skirt.
Mueller inappropriately grabbed her, putting his hand up her skirt.
[Taylor] This had happened to me. We told his boss.
They did an investigation. He got fired,
then he sued me for millions of dollars,
so I countersued for one dollar.
You walk into a courtroom,
and then there's this person sitting in a swivel chair,
staring at you like you did something to him.
The first thing they say to you in court
is, "Why didn't you scream?
Why didn't you react quicker?
Why didn't you stand further away from him?"
Then he has a lawyer get up and just lie.
There were seven people who saw him do this,
and we had a photo of it happening.
And I was so angry.
I was angry that I had to be there.
I was angry that this happens to women.
I was angry that people are paid to antagonize victims.
I was angry that all the details had been twisted.
You don't feel a sense of any victory when you win...
because the process is so dehumanizing.
This is with seven witnesses and a photo.
What happens when you get raped, and it's your word against his?
So, um, I just wanted toâ€¦ [sighs]
Just kind of looking back, umâ€¦
this exact day a year ago, umâ€¦
...I was, uhâ€¦ I was not playing a sold-out stadium in Tampa,
I was-- I was in a courtroom in Denver, Colorado, umâ€¦
Honestly, I-I was there for a sexual assault case,
andâ€¦
t-this day, a year ago, was the day that, umâ€¦
[voice breaking] â€¦uh, the day that the jury decided in my favor and said that they believed me.
I guess I just think about all the people that weren't believed,
people who haven't been believed,
or the people who are afraid to s-speak up because they think they won't be believed.
Andâ€¦
And I justâ€¦ I just wanted to say that, umâ€¦
I just wanted to say I'm sorry to anyone who ever wasn't believed
because I don't know h-- what turn my life would have takenÂ if somebody'd--
if people didn't believe me
when I said that something had happened to me.
Soâ€¦
-[Andrea crying] I'm so proud of youâ€¦ -Thanks, Mom.
â€¦for taking this shitbag of shit they gave you.
-And you made it into this. -Oh, my God.
[Andrea] I'm really proud of you.
-[sniffles] -It's okay now.
[Andrea pats Taylor] I'm good.
[Taylor] I-I justâ€¦
I couldn't really stop thinking about it.
And I just thought to myself,
"Next time there is any opportunity to change anything,
you had better know what you stand for and what you wanna say."
We are less than three weeks out until the midterms,
and Tennessee's senate candidate Marsha Blackburn is up in the polls.
Congratulations, I know you've got a little momentum going.
This is the third poll in a row that has shown you in the lead.
[Taylor] My team's really not happy with me right now.
All I've talked about for the last couple of months is the election in Tennessee.
It's not that I want to step into this. I just-- I can't not at this point. Likeâ€¦
something is different in my life,
completely andÂ unchangeably different since the sexual assault trial last year.
Like, and noâ€¦ no man in my organization or in my family
will ever understand what that was like.
[man 1] For 12 years, we've not got involved with politics or religion.
Yeah, but this is on the home front.
And also, back in the presidential election,
I was in such a horrendous place
that I wasn't gonna pop my head out of the sand for anything.
[Scott] Why would you?
I mean, does Bob Hope do it? Did Bing Crosby do it?
-Does-- Does Mick Jagger do it? -[Andrea] Honey, what the hell? Come on!
-[Scott] What I'm saying is-- -Bob Hope and Bing Crosby?
First of all, these aren't your dad's celebrities,
and these aren't your dad's Republicans.
[man 1] Imagine if we came to you and said, "Hey, we've got this idea
that we could halve the number of people that come to your next tour."
[man 2] The other thing, just from a security standpoint,
"Taylor Swift comes out against Trump."
I don't care if they write that!
I'm sad that I didn't two years ago, but I can't change that.
I'm saying right now
that this is something that I know is right, and, you guys, I need to be on the right side of history.
and, you guys, I need to be on the right side of history.
And if he doesn't winâ€¦ -[stammering] â€¦then at least I tried. -[man 2] Taylor, here's the problem.
-[stammering] â€¦then at least I tried. -[man 2] Taylor, here's the problem.
I just want to read you what I wrote, and I'm gonna try to startâ€¦
I just want you to know that this is important to me. This is--
-[Scott] I totally agree with the issue, -Have--
-but let me explain to youâ€¦ -Have you heard her?
[Scott] I've read the entire thing, and the bottom line right now: I'm terrified.
and the bottom line right now: I'm terrified.
I'm the guy that went out and bought armored cars.
I worry for her safety as much as anybody does.
Maybe more.
[voice breaking] It really is a big deal to me.
She votes againstâ€¦ against fair pay for women,
she votes against the reauthorization of theâ€¦ of the Violence Against Women Act,
which is just basically protecting us from domestic abuse and stalking. Stalking!
She votesâ€¦ She thinks that-- that if you're a gay couple
or even if you look like a gay couple,
you should be allowed to be kicked out of a restaurant.
It's really basic human rights, and it's right and wrong at this point,
and I can't see another commercialâ€¦
and see her disguising these policies
behind the words "Tennessee Christian values."
Those aren't Tennessee Christian values.
I live in Tennessee. I am a Christian.
That's not what we stand for.
I need to do this. I need you to justâ€¦
Dad, I just need you to forgive me for doing it,Â 'cause I'm doing it.
-Okay, so... -I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little nervous.
-You should be. -[woman chuckles] Ooh.
-I want to do this. -Okay, soâ€¦ [sighs]
I always have to bring up everything that could go sideways--
-everything we need to expect. -Yeah.
-One: the president could come after you. -Fuck that, I don't care.
If I get bad press for saying, "Don't put a homophobic racist in office," then I get bad press for that.
"Don't put a homophobic racist in office," then I get bad press for that.
-I really don't care. -I would stand behind that 1,000 times.
-Me too. -Yeah.
I think that it is so frilly and spineless of me
to stand onstage and go, "Happy Pride Month, you guys,"
and then not say thisâ€¦
when someone's literally coming for their neck.
[quietly] Yeah.
-[Andrea] All right, cheers. -Cheers, ladies.
-[Andrea] God help us all. -Cheers to the resistance.
[chuckles] To the resist-- Stop it.
[softly] It's gonna be okay.
Oh, my God.
Oh, it's so scary. This is the picture.
-Oneâ€¦ -[Taylor and Andrea] â€¦two, threeâ€¦
-...go. -[gasps]
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. -[Tree] Oh, my goodness.
Taylor Swift broke her silence on politics over the weekend,
publicly backing two Democrats in Tennessee.
Taylor Swift is taking her first political stand,
backing Democrat Phil Bredesen.
The superstar making it clear to her 112 million followers on Instagram,
and the world, where she stands.
[reporter] Taylor Swift's jumping into politics. What do you say?
Let's say that I like Taylor's music about 25% less now, okay?
[reporter 1] The 28-year-old pop star made her statement on Instagram.
[reporter 2] She broke her longstanding policy of not talking politics...
[reporter 3] â€¦using her voice in a new way.
[reporter 4] This is so out of the norm for Taylor Swift, who...
[reporter 5] Republicans for years have thought
that Taylor Swift was a crypto-conservative, and she justâ€¦
[reporter 6] It is a risky move for an entertainer to step into politics at her age,
-at her stage in her career. -[reporter 7] Vote.org reporting
more registrations in the last day since Taylor's post than in all of August.
According to vote.org on Monday,
nationwide there have been 51,308 new registrations
-in the past 24 hours. -[Andrea] Whoa! Yeah!
-[man] So proud of you. -[Tree] Congratulations.
-[Taylor] Thank you. -Go, Taylor.
Do you think it'llâ€¦ Do you thinkâ€¦
[woman] I think it could, definitely. It's your first race, soâ€¦
I really hope it actually, actually does something.
But you know what? Donald Trump likes my music 25% less.
I feel 200 pounds lighter.
I just feel like aâ€¦ I just feelâ€¦ I've been feeling this way for months.
[Tree] Perez Hilton just posted,
"Note how Republicans are attacking Taylor Swift's intelligence
instead of her ideas.
They don't respect women enough to debate them."
It's not not true.
-You look gorgeous. -[Taylor] Thank you.
-Stunning and sexy. -I look like a melted-down disco ball.
-[assistant 1] I love it. -[assistant 2]My God, you look amazing.
-[Taylor] I amâ€¦ -Oh my God. -[assistant 3] Gorgeous. -â€¦a Pop-Tart wrapper.
-[assistant 3] Gorgeous. -â€¦a Pop-Tart wrapper.
-[assistant 5] Try this on that ear. -[woman] She's got thatâ€¦
You know what? This is gonna sound ridiculous,
-but I can't move past here. -Ooh, you got it. -[group laughs] -You got it.
That's how this dress makes me feel.
[assistant 1] Can you breathe?
-I can brea-- I can. -[assistant 1] Yeah.
-Is it easy? No. -[assistant 1] The other one's better.
[man] Don't block her.
-[photographer 1] Taylor!Â Taylor! -[photographer 2] Taylor!
-[photographers shouting indistinctly] -[camera shutters clicking]
[photographer 3] Taylor, look over to your right!
[Taylor] Thank you for this.
And I just wanted to make a mention of the fact
that this award and every single award given out tonight
were voted on by the people.
And you know what else is voted on by the peopleâ€¦
â€¦is the midterm elections on November 6th. Get out and vote. I love you.
[choreographer 1] Pre-chorus. Six, seven, eight.
Yeah, I need to work on my face.
I look like I have a mean face sometimes when I'm not trying to.
Know what I mean?
I think you might be more sensitive than me to that.
-[chuckles] -Yeah, I have a really slappable face.
-Slappable? Ouch! -Yeah, you just want to be likeâ€¦
"What are you plotting?
What's she planning?" I'm not meaning to look like that.
You looked confident and strong. It's the chorus.
-[laughs] -You got it. All right, we'llâ€¦
I'm gonna try to be more likable on the next one.
All right, all right. Perfect.
[choreographer 2] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Oneâ€¦
[Taylor] I wish I didn't feel like there's a better version of me out there.
I feel that way all the time.
You know what we call this? This is "last rhino of the stampede,"
You know what we call this? This is "last rhino of the stampede," up here, justâ€¦ [groans]
Everybody else is runnin'. Limping.
First to get eaten.
I keep looking down because I'm afraid.
And it shows.
[Taylor] It's a lot to process because we do exist in this society
where women in entertainment are discarded in an elephant graveyard
-by the time they're 35. -[choreographer 2 clapping]
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[Taylor] Everyone's a shiny, new toy for, like, two years.
[Taylor] The female artists that I know of
have reinvented themselves 20 times more than the male artists.
They have toâ€¦
or else you're out of a job.
Constantly having to reinvent,
constantly finding new facets of yourself that people find to be shiny.
-[crowd cheers] -[Taylor] Be new to us, be young to us,
but only in a new way and only in the way we want.
And reinvent yourself,
but only in a way that we find to be equally comforting
but also a challenge for you.
Live out a narrative
that we find to be interesting enough to entertain us,
but not so crazy that it makes us uncomfortable.
This is probably one of my last opportunitiesÂ as an artist
to grasp onto that kind of success.
Soâ€¦
I don't know, like, as I'm reaching 30, I'm likeâ€¦
"I want to work really hardâ€¦
while society is still tolerating me being successful."
[reporter] We have another result from the Senate. Marsha Blackburn--
[reporter] We have another result from the Senate. Marsha Blackburn-- we were just talking about that-- Marsha Blackburn will win the Senate seat.
we were just talking about that-- Marsha Blackburn will win the Senate seat.
The Bredesen camp was very much hoping for the "Swift lift," as they called it,
because young voter turnout spiked here by sevenfold
from the previous midterm election, and yet that wasn't enough.
I guess Tay Tay didn't have that much sway-sway.
I can't believe it.Â I can't believe it.
I can't believe that she gets to be the first female senator in Tennessee
and she's-- she's Trump in a wig.
She represents no female interests.
She won by being a female applying
to the kind of female males want us to be
in a horrendousâ€¦Â 1950s world.
So, for the next two years,
we have to build on what started here.
The first verse I want to be all about, like, hearing the news.
You know, if you were, like, a kid who, like, loved Beto
and thought that was the future of Texas,
or you really thought Stacey Abrams was gonna win
and you went door-to-door, trying to make it happen,
and then she still gets beatâ€¦
-[Joel] It didn't happen. -And it didn't happen.
But it's like, statistically,
you know, we have, what?
Three to four million people turning 18 in the next two years before the next one?
So, it's likeâ€¦
it's basically saying, like, "Don't lose hope. Don't getâ€¦"
[Joel] Yeah, your time will come if you just hang in there.
-Yeah. -[Joel] Yeah.
â™ª Only the young â™ª â™ª Only the young â™ª
â™ª Only the young â™ª
â™ª Can run â™ª
[Joel] What?
I have this idea...
...called "Only the Young."
Play it again.
â™ª And I know tonightÂ â™ª
â™ª Oh, but only the youngÂ â™ª
â™ª Only the youngÂ â™ª
â™ª Only the youngÂ â™ª
â™ª Only the youngÂ â™ª
â™ª Can runÂ â™ª
-[Joel chuckles] Oh, nice. -â™ª Only the young â™ª
[Taylor] That's basically saying, like, "Resist."
If you can just shift the power in your direction by being bold enough,
then it won't be like this forever.
-Run. Break away from this. -Yeah, yeah. Like, you can run from fascism.
Mmkay, I have a partial verse.
-[Joel] Yeah? -Yeah.
â™ª It keeps me awake The look on your face â™ª
â™ª The moment you heard the newsÂ â™ª
â™ª Frozen in time and screaming insideÂ â™ª
â™ª You did all that you could doÂ â™ª
â™ª The game was rigged The ref got tricked â™ª
â™ª The wrong ones think they're rightÂ â™ª
â™ª And you were outnumbered â™ª
-[Joel] Ooh. -â™ª This timeÂ â™ª
-[Joel] Oh. -â™ª But only the young â™ª
-[Joel] Yes. -â™ª Only the youngÂ â™ª
â™ª Only the youngÂ â™ª
â™ª Only the youngÂ â™ª
â™ª Can runÂ â™ª
â™ª Only theÂ youngÂ â™ª
â™ª Can runÂ â™ª
â™ª So, every day now You brace for the soundÂ â™ª
â™ª You've only heard on TVÂ â™ª
â™ª You go to class scared Wondering whereÂ â™ª
â™ª The best hiding spot would beÂ â™ª
â™ª And the big bad man And his big bad clanÂ â™ª
â™ª Their hands are stained with redÂ â™ª
â™ª Oh, how quickly you forgetÂ â™ª
â™ª That only the youngÂ â™ª
â™ª Only the youngÂ â™ª
â™ª Only the youngÂ â™ª
â™ª Only the youngÂ â™ª
â™ª Can runÂ â™ª
â™ª Can runÂ â™ª
â™ª So run â™ª
â™ª And runÂ â™ª
â™ª And runÂ â™ª
I just-- I feel really good about not feelingâ€¦
muzzled anymore.
And it was my own doing.
I needed to learn a lot before I spoke to 200 million people.
Butâ€¦ I've educated myself now,
and it's time to take the masking tape off of my mouth...
like, forever. [laughs]
[Jonathan Van Ness] You were really major at midterms, honey. [Taylor] Thank you.
If you have anything I can help with, just let me know.
I think we just need to, like, really keep talking about it
because we really do need people to put the pressure on those senators
to pass the Equality Act. If they are forced to vote on it and they do vote against it publicly,
If they are forced to vote on it and they do vote against it publicly,
then it's really-- then we have their numbers,
you know, for next year.
[Taylor] Literally, just call me for anything,
'cause you do so many good things for people.
[crew member 1] All right, here we go. Andâ€¦ roll camera. -[crew member 2] Rolling! -[crew member 1] And playback!
-[crew member 2] Rolling! -[crew member 1] And playback!
[Taylor] I want to love glitter
and also stand up for the double standards
that exist in our society.
I want to wear pink
and tell you how I feel about politics.
And I don't think that those things have to cancel each other out.
[Todrick Hall] How long have you been doing this?
About a year.
When I realized that I really like having cute nails,
but I really can't go in public. [chuckles]
I will die if I get a VMA.
Well, if we win something, you're definitely first on the list.
I will lose my shit. -You don't understand. -[laughs]
[Todrick] This is one of my favorite manis I've ever gotten.
I appreciate it. Give me a good review on Yelp.
[Todrick] I will.
-Swift Nails is the place to go. -Yeah.
-It looks so good. -Fuck, yeah.
And the VMA goes toâ€¦
Taylor Swift, "You Need to Calm Down."
At the end of this video, there was a petition,
and there still is a petitionâ€¦
â€¦for the Equality Act,
which basically just says we all deserve equal rights
under the law.
[clicks tongue] Andâ€¦
I want to thank everyone who signed that petition
because it now has half a million signatures, whichâ€¦
...which is five times the amount that it would need to warrant a response
...which is five times the amount that it would need to warrant a response from the White House. -["You Need to Calm Down" playing] -â™ª Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh â™ª
I'm trying to be as educated as possible on how to respect people,
on how toâ€¦
deprogram the misogyny in my own brain.
Toss it out, reject it, and resist it.
Like, there is no such thing as a slut.
There is no such thing as a bitch.
There is no such thing as someone who's bossy, there's just a boss.
We don't want to be condemned for being multifaceted.
-Sorry, that was a real soapbox. -[interviewer] No.
-Oh, my God, it-- -Why did I say sorry? [grunts, chuckles]
-You're just-- -[interviewer] No, it'sâ€¦
because we're trained to say sorry.
Yeah, we legitimately are. We're, likeâ€¦
[whispering] "Sorry, was I loudâ€¦ in my own house that I bought
with the songs that I wroteâ€¦
about my own life?" [scoffs]
[Taylor] There's nothing that feels better than this moment.
It's out. It's out on iTunes.
It's out on iTunes. Oh, my God.
It's out. It's out. It's out. We're listening to it right now.
[Jack] This is so cool. Toast to Taylor.
No one is this good and works harder.
If you're that good, usually you don't work that hard.
-I love you guys all so much. -[guest] We love you.
After 13 years of constantly feeling like I was misunderstood,
knowing that everything that happened was all gonna turn into this moment isâ€¦
fucking awesome. [chuckles]
[Taylor] There's this thing people say about celebrities,
that they're frozen at the age they got famous,
and that's kind of what happened to me.
[Taylor] I had a lot of growing up to do, just trying to catch up to 29.
Just gonna go have fun.
No one out there that I know of in the audience actively hates me.
Not get dead-faced.
-[Andrea] Have fun the whole time. -Yeah.
[assistant] Ready to do this? -Readyâ€¦ Totally ready. -[assistant] Ready.
[Taylor] May 19th, 2003.
"Oh, I tried to practice my songs, but I completely psyched myself out
and broke down crying.
I don't know if I can do this.
I want it so bad, but I get so scared of what might happen.
Relax, I can handle it.
I'm young. I'm talented. They'll see it in me.
I've got to hang on." â™ª All the king's horses â™ª
â™ª Couldn't put me together again â™ª
[Taylor] I wanna still have a sharp pen
I heard so many stories about this place.
I've heard so many stories
that it's become hard to separate
the myths from the truth.
But I only know one story to be true.
Every midnight
at the end of the third floor corridor,
beside the stairwell,
you'll find a comfort room.
No one dares to go there anymore.
Because if you go inside...
there...
when you reach the last cubicle,
that's where she hung herself.
Her name...
is Erika.
Do you trust me?
Do you know what this is?
When I count to three,
I want you to slam your hand here, okay?
One...
two...
three!
I ordered to turn the lights off hours ago.
You must contemplate your sins in silence.
The confession will start tomorrow at 6 o'clock sharp.
Do not be late.
Lie down!
Close your eyes!
If you cannot sleep, pray.
Be ready to confess your sins tomorrow.
Do you understand?
Yes, Sor Alice.
Jo.
Hey, Jo. Come with me, I need to pee.
Mich?
Come with me please, I need to pee.
Hey.
More.
Ready...
Miss?
Smile for the camera.
Okay, girls,
compress.
Okay?
Ready?
Pat, look at this.
What a waste.
Why weren't you smiling?
It's okay.
Maybe I had too much on my mind.
Especially after what happened to Anna.
Is it true? Sor Alice found her?
That's what I heard from Sister Luz and Costanza.
I don't understand why she won't let me talk to the girl--
Sor Alice can manage her.
But--
Pat, you're overthinking this.
Joyce.
They caught you on the rooftop again?
Hand it over.
It's already empty.
What's this for anyway?
To keep me awake.
Isn't it better if you rest?
Are you even getting any sleep?
I should have gone with Anna.
She could still be at Sta. Lucia if I did.
Joyce,
what happened to Anna is not your fault.
What do you think happened?
Did she see something?
No one's talking about it, no one's telling us anything.
Only Anna can tell what really happened.
I didn't know you could leave just like that.
I wish I left a long time ago.
Why?
It's the same every day.
That's why I stay on the rooftop, so I can clear my mind.
It's as if everything's useless, like nothing matters.
Joyce...
are you hurting yourself again?
Sor Alice will kill me.
-Joyce? -I'm late again.
You can always come here if you need someone to talk to, okay?
This is for you, Miss Pat.
Why are you sad here again?
That's not me.
The Supreme Court has put Ramon Pascual on death row.
Pascual was caught in the act
decapitating the head of his mother.
Pascual is among the growing number of criminals convicted with death sentence
since it was imposed in 1993.
Mr. Fidel.
-Good evening, Miss Consolacion. -Good evening.
Working this late again?
As always.
You know I don't have anyone to go home to.
Maybe you should start looking for...
someone to go home to.
So you don't have to work all the time.
Okay. Take care of yourself.
You too.
Good evening, Eri.
How have you been?
I read the last book in the library.
I've read everything.
Let's get out of here, Miss Pat.
Where will we go?
Anywhere.
If only I could leave this place.
Why canâ€™t you?
Is that what happens to people...
like you?
Maybe.
Do you want me to come with you?
Eri...
what happened to Anna?
Did she see you?
I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry.
They're all afraid of me.
Why aren't you?
Should I be afraid?
My father...
he wasn't afraid either.
I still see him sometimes.
There, in the corner...
staring at me.
At us.
Where?
Eri?
Eri...
Where are we going?
Why can't you leave?
Is that what happens to people...
That was the sixth session with Eri, but she still wonâ€™t tell me her story.
She needs someone to talk to,
but she wonâ€™t tell me what really happened to her.
Why did she kill herself?
If I knew the answer, I'd know my students better.
I can keep them safe.
We forced her to stay late at night just to punish her.
After what happened to Anna, we should've known better.
We all know Mr. Fidel.
He spent his whole life serving at Sta. Lucia.
Do you really believe he could do something like this?
I'll talk to the children.
Maybe they know something.
Sor Alice, isn't that too soon?
A lot of parents called-- It's out of our hands if they want to leave.
It's out of our hands if they want to leave.
There are still those who chose to stay.
That's all that matters.
Miss. Consolacion,
may I speak with you?
Just a moment.
Hand it over.
You'll get into trouble again.
The matches too.
The session isn't over yet, all right?
Come in.
I'm Julian. I've been assigned to investigate this case.
How can I help you?
You know Fidel, right?
He was working here, even before I was hired.
Which got me thinking...
if he's capable of doing this, why only now?
I've been asking myself the same question.
Is it true you're taking him to Muntinlupa?
Yes.
Death row?
I can't say just yet.
-You also own one of these? -Maybe there were other people
at the crime scene the night Clara was murdered.
I'll ask around, my students might know something.
They trust me.
Good.
Use that. When you get information
useful to the investigation...
call me.
Here's my number.
Thank you.
Most of the conversations I have with my students are confidential.
Their secret is my secret.
I'll call you when something comes up.
Ms. Consolacion, I'm here to help.
We won't tell this to the chief yet.
The chief is already convinced that Fidel did it.
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
Clara?
What do you think?
How old are these butterflies?
Butterflies only live for a few months.
They don't look dead to me.
They look like they could still fly.
They're not moving...
because they are imprisoned.
I know...
you want to talk to her.
Do you know where she is right now?
Why would I tell you?
You know, you can always talk to me,
right?
You know, Ms. Pat, you have a nice voice.
Not like my mother's.
It's been decades now...
I still can't forget my mother's voice...
It echoes around me,
still ringing in my ears.
It was like how the nuns at school shouted at me.
It surrounds you, suffocates you...
until you're totally helpless.
Until all you can do is submit.
I can still hear the nuns screaming.
Even now that I'm...
dead.
Someone's coming.
Who, Eri?
There will be a new set of rules here at Sta. Lucia.
Students are not allowed to walk around, unless in pairs.
Students will be assigned to a partner
for every trip to the hallway or the washroom,
and during recess.
Everyone must sign attendance for every class.
And most importantly,
all faculty and students must be off the campus by 6 p.m. sharp.
Those who do not abide will be suspended...
Do you still remember...
the time when I had the chance to defend Ces
when she was bullied by Mary?
-But I did nothing. -Clara don't blame yourself.
What if you ever see me in need of help, will you come to my rescue?
But you're a grownup, you can take care of yourself.
Even grownups need saving sometimes.
Okay, Miss Pat.
When the time comes that you need help, I promise to be there for you.
And I promise to be there for you too.
Sor Alice?
-Hello, Julian? It's me, Pat. -Hello?
Is there any way I can talk to Fidel?
Pat, Fidel's case is high profile.
Not anyone can talk to him.
I just want to hear him out.
How about you? How have you been?
The suspect accused of strangling...
I haven't gotten anything yet.
It's as if they want to forget the whole thing,
-just to save the school's image. -...in the murder
of fourteen-year-old student, Clara Nemenzo...
Sorry, Julian.
...whose body was found at 6 o'clock in the morning by a nun in Sta. Lucia...
Pat? Hello?
I'll call you back.
We will do everything in our power
to make sure the bastard gets the death penalty.
I hope the president hears this. I hope he helps us.
We deserve justice, even if that means death for that son of a bitch.
Fidel Cariaso, the caretaker of Sta. Lucia Academy,
is now being charged with homicide.
Clara?
Clara?
Did I startle you?
Don't--
Don't look at me.
Clara?
Clara...
Don't worry.
I didn't mean to.
Clara, who killed you?
Someone's coming.
Miss Consolacion!
Sor Alice...
what are you doing here?
Shouldn't I be the one asking you that?
There's a new rule now.
No one should be here after 6 p.m.
What about you?
I'm just making sure no one is loitering around here.
Fidel is no longer here, and the school isn't going to look after itself.
What happened to Clara that night you were punishing her?
What are you trying to say, Patricia?
Someone died that night, and we both know Fidel didn't kill her.
If you're going to make trouble...
while others are still mourning...
donâ€™t bother coming here.
Isn't now the time you need me the most?
When the children don't know what to do?
They will know what to do if they listen.
I just want to know what happened.
I'll give you one last chance.
Think about what you're doing.
If I see you again around here at this hour...
I will be forced to suspended you, Patricia.
Do you understand?
This isn't your purpose here.
I advise you to pray, Patricia.
So that your conscience will be cleared.
Joyce?
Joyce!
Joyce...
Help us!
Ms. Pat?
What are you thinking about?
Maybe...
my brother.
You have a brother?
My older brother.
Why didn't you mention him before?
He's not here anymore.
He died a long time ago.
What happened to him?
Mom and Dad weren't around that night.
My brother and I were the only ones in the house.
And then...
I went to his room.
Then...
I can still remember the smell of his room.
I opened the door...
The signs had always been there...
but no one listened.
Joyce.
I couldn't save my brother, Anna...
or Clara.
But you...
Promise me you'll fight through this.
How is she?
She can talk now, but she still...
she still needs to rest for now.
Why did you come here?
They already closed the case.
Pat, Fidel killed Clara.
There's nothing we can do for him.
Pat.
Pat, wait.
Girls, stop.
Girls, stop.
Girls!
Don't!
Sta. Lucia has been here for decades.
We've been this way ever since.
Nothing has changed.
For the longest time I've been here,
and not once...
did anyone question our methods.
It isn't right to treat them that way.
All you talk about is discipline, when the children are dying.
If only you were doing your job,
Joyce wouldn't have attempted suicide.
-Pat, Sor Alice is only human-- -She's blaming me for Joyce's attempt.
I shouldn't say this, but...
she's been through this before.
What happened to her student was even worse.
What happened?
It was a long time ago. I've only heard rumors about it.
They said the child hung herself...
somewhere inside Sta. Lucia.
What was her name?
I can't remember.
It happened years ago, long before I was in Sta. Lucia.
I need your help.
-Why? -I need access to Sor Alice's files.
I need to know the name of the child who hung herself.
I have a feeling that this is related to what happened to Clara.
I can't, Pat.
Even if I wanted to help, I might get suspended.
I'll do it myself.
Pat!
I'm already suspended.
What more can they do to me?
Wait.
You know Erika Sayco?
What happened to Erika?
To Clara?
I was a guidance counselor before.
During that time, only nuns were permitted to work in Sta. Lucia.
How do you even help someone who doesn't want to be helped?
Erika Sayco was like that.
The way of God was the only way I knew to help her.
But God wasn't enough for her.
So, you gave up?
Now I'm starting to realize...
that God doesn't have all the answers.
I'm sorry.
Then why do you keep interfering?
Why can't I help them in the way I know how?
Tell Erika to forgive me.
Tell her to ask for God's forgiveness for what she's done.
"What she's done?"
Fidel wasn't the only one there the night Clara died.
There's a reason why spirits remain on this earth.
But I never dared to find out why.
This is what they have taught us.
I tried so hard to hide this truth...
away from Sta. Lucia, away from Clara,
and from you, Patricia.
There are things far too evil for us to ever understand.
Some souls are so filled with hate
that they wish nothing but harm for the living.
At that point I don't know what to do, thereâ€™s nothing I can do!
I'm not like you.
I won't give up on her.
Pat!
Pat!
-Pat! -Sorry to bother you.
-Not at all. -Come inside.
I found what you asked for.
You need to see this.
-What did you find? -With Erika, nothing.
She hung herself in the comfort room of Sta. Lucia.
That's the only evidence I found.
It was ruled out as suicide, but I checked her father's files,
Ernesto Sayco.
Eri's father?
Two years after Eri's death, he killed his wife.
Inside the car, outside of Sta. Lucia, he strangled her.
-That's what she told me. -Who?
A student of mine, she told me about this rumor.
Ernesto was sent to the electric chair.
They said he went insane after his daughter's death.
But there was no clear motive.
I got his confession.
Listen.
Yes, I killed my wife.
Why did you kill her?
I don't know. I had no control over myself.
We've argued many times, but not like this.
I was filled with rage.
A rage I've never felt before--
You have your tape recorder, right?
This is Fidel's confession.
-God help me, I didn't mean to. -Not me, I couldn't do this.
-Help me, I'm not a murderer. -It's not my fault, I couldn't control it.
-I wrapped my hands around her neck... -I wrapped my hands around her neck...
-I choked the life out of her. -I choked the life out of her.
-I don't know why I did it. -I couldn't control myself.
-I had no control. -I don't know why.
-Please sir, don't throw me in jail. -I don't know what came over me.
I have a family!
I need to go.
Wait, where are you going?
-I need to go to Sta. Lucia. -Wait, I'll come with you.
Why would he do it? Why would he kill all of a sudden?
If he really did it, why? Where is the motive?
-What will he get from killing her? -Wait.
Pat, I don't understand what you're saying.
There's something wrong here.
-What's wrong? -Everything!
-I can handle myself. -Wait, where are you going?
-Pat! -Thank you!
Eri?
Eri?
Why are you crying?
It hurts.
It hurts so much.
Let's do it this way.
I'll go in.
You won't see me.
I won't see you.
But we'll talk.
Ms. Pat, why do you keep coming back here?
I want to find out the motive of the people who did this to you.
If I can do that, I would learn how to talk to someone like you.
People like me?
People who were wronged.
You'll stay with me?
Yes, I'll stay with you.
Always?
Always.
You'll follow me...
to Hell?
-What? -Will you see your brother there?
Isn't it a sin to kill yourself?
That's what they taught us before.
Even Sor Alice said it.
People like me,
should have never been born.
Eri, that's not true.
That's what everyone told me.
I have no friends.
No one wanted to be friends with me.
Even her.
Especially her.
No one understood me.
They wouldn't listen.
Even at home...
my mother cut my hair so short...
So... ugly.
They laughed at me.
All of them.
I wanted to die.
They say, God is always right.
No one else, only Him.
All must submit to Him.
His happiness should come first, even if we're suffering.
I tried to leave, but they didn't allow me.
We must all suffer for our most beloved God.
But I noticed I was the only one suffering.
So, I promised myself that one day...
I won't be alone in my suffering.
For God, we must come together.
My parents went to Sta. Lucia to collect the things I'd left.
There, I discovered I could do things
that I couldn't do while I was still alive.
My mother, she was easy to kill.
She was weak.
But my father...
he was even weaker.
What did you do?
You still don't know?
I used Fidel to kill Clara...
so I could have a friend.
But when she was here, she didn't want to be friends with me.
She's like the other girls before.
Eri, what they did to you was wrong.
But this...
Killing people?
They killed me. They killed me every day.
Now you know...
do you still want to be with me?
What?
I was okay being alone. I was contented.
But one day, you came along.
You befriended me.
You told me to get out and be friends with others.
But do you know what I found out?
No one will ever understand me.
Not people like you!
I can't live again,
but you people can be like me...
Dead.
First, Clara...
now, you!
You're not going to run like her, right?
He's coming.
Miss Pat? Why are you running?
Isn't this what you wanted?
Now we'll know what they all say and think.
You no longer have to ask.
Eri, don't do this, please, let's talk. Let Julian go.
He's coming.
Help!
Help!
Eri!
I never saw them again after that night.
Eri, or Clara.
I don't know where they went.
It's now quiet here at Sta. Lucia...
Too quiet.
I don't know what to say anymore...
to Julian...
to the police...
to Sor Alice.
I don't have anyone to talk to.
No one's going to believe me anyway.
If Fidel really killed Clara...
there's nothing I can do for him...
or for Eri.
Joyce?
Joyce?
Joyce! Joyce!
Joyce!
Joyce!
Miss Pa--
Miss Pat,
if you can hear me...
If you can really hear me, please, help me.
Joyce!
