Morning, Ms. Rita, mm-hmm. Morning, Monty.
-Hey, Maya. -Hey, Monty.
Hey, baby.
-What up, Willie? -What's up, young blood?
-How are you? -Old and tired. [chuckles]
That woman say this engine won't start.
Yeah, well, it won't.
You know, Monty, he was supposed to fix it.
Never did.
He don't know what he doing. That fool can't even see.
I saw your momma the night you were made.
What'd you say to me? Don't you make me put this baby down.
That ain't no way to talk to me.
I gave this car service one of its best clients.
Yeah, you never let me forget it neither.
That's right. Maya, I'll take a look at it for you, baby.
-Take a seat. -Thank you.
You all right? And you better do something, you know Chico quit.
You don't want to lose my boss as a client. Ma'am.
Here you go, Willie. [Willie] How much is here?
[Monty] Not enough, but I'll get it to you. I promise. Okay?
Hey, hey, man, look. I just lost one of my drivers.
He was the only one classy enough to drive the old corporate types.
-Now, listen to me-- -No, no, no, Willie.
-Now, listen to me-- -No, no, no, Willie. You know I can't stand them. Hear me out. The pay is good.
Hear me out. The pay is good.
-The stuck-up types. -Oh, come on, now.
It would help you make more of a down payment for this place.
Man, Willie. You know I'm better under the hood
than I am behind the wheel, man.
Do you really want to buy this place? Now this is a start. The pay is good.
Now this is a start. The pay is good. I got you a good client, and she pays well. I don't want to lose her.
I got you a good client, and she pays well. I don't want to lose her.
-I'll think about it. -You'll think--what?
I'll think--what? Watch it, old man.
I'll think--what? Watch it, old man. You watch it.
Maya, turn the key?
-[Maya] Thank you, Monty. -All right, baby.
You know, this should really be your place.
Oh, it will be soon, baby. A'ight.
-Hey, boy. How you been? -What up, Kevin.
-All right? -Yeah.
Oh, man. Oh, man.
Wilbert! Get up!
-Hey, Monty. -Hey, Ms. Rochelle.
You got people stepping all over you!
-He at it again? -Get up!
Always. Always.
[woman] Hi, Monty!
Wilbert! Get up, boy!
[Monty] Is anybody home?
[coughs] Sierra? [coughing] Get the door.
Who is it? [Monty] Who is it? It's your daddy. Open up.
Hey, y'all, it's daddy! [both] Daddy!
[Monty] Come on, y'all. Hurry up.
Hey. What up, come here, come here, come here.
What's going on? Can I come in?
Hey, Ms. Kat.
Hey, Daddy, what'd you bring us? Oh, now, is that all I'm good for?
No. -Can I get some love? -[laughter]
Daddy, you know I got a "B" on my class project?
[Monty] Oh. -Thanks for helping me. -What'd I tell you?
Girl's gonna get a good grade. And I did.
Hey, daddy? Will you take us to the movies this weekend?
-No. -[coughs]
Okay.
I'll take you out to the movies.
You know, Saturday is daddy-daughter day so.
Okay. So, Daddy, what did you bring us? Just some food, baby.
-Dad... -That always comes in handy.
You girls go in the room, let me talk to your daddy.
You girls go in the room, let me talk to your daddy. Get in there. Don't make me come in there.
What y'all doing, playing checkers? Huh?
You're always playing something.
Here, Ms. Kat, I got 200 this week.
I'll owe the rest to you.
You know, Ms. Kat, you know you gotta take care of that cough.
I mean, it sounds like it's getting worse every time I come up in here.
[sniffs] Yeah.
Jenny been by?
That daughter of mine?
No. Only time I see her is when she's driving by.
She ain't been here to see these girls in months.
So happy you're here, or they wouldn't know they had a daddy or a momma.
Monty? You sit back. Sit down.
You sit back. Sit down.
What's wrong?
I need you to go down to family court with me right away,
so you can tell them that you're taking the girls.
I need you to raise them.
Ms. Kat, you know I love my kids, but I can't take them full-time--
Then they gonna have to stay with their mom.
-Now, you know I don't want that. -Neither do I.
Especially since she's living with that Joe, the biggest drug dealer in the area.
Sitting up there in that window, staring down at all of us like he's God.
And she's right there with him.
She don't care about nobody but herself.
Do you know what'll happen to them girls if they have to live with their momma? Huh?
God forbid.
-Monty, please. -Ms. Kat, I--I--
I have lung cancer.
I am dying, Monty.
I've been hanging in here for them girls as long as I can, but I'm dying.
I'm dying.
Why didn't you say something? Why didn't you tell me this?
Ms. Kat, it's gonna be all right.
It is not gonna be all right.
Why didn't y'all call me?
Mommy! -Don't look at her. -[Jenny] No, wait.
Wait, where do you think you're going?
These are my kids. Stop. Stop. Get out of here!
Get in the car, baby. Stop. Quit it! No, you get off of me!
Stop it, Jenny! Stop it. For real.
Everything all right, baby? No, you get my kids out of this car!
Jenny, stop, stop!
You have not been to see these kids in months.
You want to come take them now? Huh?
Get off of me! You gotta be crazy. Get out of here.
Nah, you need to back up, son. Yo, do me a favor, shut up.
Stop it! Stop it, stop it!
Go ahead, baby. Go ahead.
This is your mother's funeral, and you know she wanted these girls to go with him.
Jennifer, you know it.
You out whoring around with these thugs.
She didn't want these girls around all of this foolishness.
Let me tell you something, Aunt Rita.
All right, these are my kids! Do you hear me?
You ain't just gonna take 'em from me!
And let me tell you, go make your mechanic money.
You save it, 'cause we're going to court, you hear me?
Give me my kids back. You're gonna give them back to me.
You stay outta my way!
What are you doing? Think you gonna let my momma die?
Huh? You gonna let them bury my momma, and you don't tell me, Willie?
[man] You should've been there for your momma.
[Jenny] You know it ain't right. [woman] Too late now.
[Sierra] Daddy, you know this place is too small for all of us.
[Lauryn] Well, we don't have anywhere else to go.
[China] we can go live with momma. China, momma don't want us. She never did.
-That's not true. -It is true.
-Is that true, daddy? -I'll tell you what is true.
I want y'all to come stay with me. Hmm?
Where we gonna sleep?
Well, I'm gonna sleep on the couch, and you guys, I mean girls,
and you guys, I mean girls, are going to sleep in the bedroom.
I fixed it up.
How bad was it before?
Daddy? China pees in the bed.
And I ain't sleeping with her.
I do not! Why you gotta put all my business out like that? What's wrong with you?
I do not! Why you gotta put all my business out like that? What's wrong with you? Whatever. We need some separate beds
Whatever. We need some separate beds or some bunk beds or something, 'cause this ain't gonna work.
or some bunk beds or something, 'cause this ain't gonna work. Well, I'll work on it, okay?
Well, while you work on it, how about feeding us
and getting all three of us some food? 'Cause all three of us are hungry.
You know what? You got a mouth like your momma.
You need to put your clothes in them drawers right here, thank you.
I like this bedroom.
Lord, how am I going to do this?
Man, I can't believe I'm doing this.
You waiting for Ms. Rossmore?
Uh, yeah. Rossmore. Julia rossmore.
Good luck.
-[chuckling] -What you mean, "Good luck"?
-Good day, Ms. Rossmore. -Good morning.
You gonna open the door?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
-Can you close the door? -Oh, yeah. Oh.
-[laughs] -What you laughing at?
[Julia] Tell him to meet me there. Tell him to wait, then.
I'm surprised the jury's returned so soon myself.
That's a great thing. Yeah, definitely. All right, see you in a second.
Did they tell you I need you to be on call?
Oh, you talking to me? You're the only other person in the car.
Oh, no, you know what, I thought you were still on the phone, you know.
Well, basically all I need you to do is get me to the office and get me to court. Mm-hmm.
Sometimes I work late, and sometimes I entertain clients after work,
that sort of thing. You know what, Ms. Rossmore? Right now, I need all the overtime I can get.
I'm sorry, what's your name?
-Oh, Monty. -Monty. Look, I don't like to fraternize,
so let's keep this strictly professional, okay?
-Yes, ma'am. -Fabulous.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry about that.
Are you-- am I getting punk'd?
No, you're not getting punk'd, ma'am.
I just, you know, thought you might want the radio--
-No, I like silence. -Yes, ma'am.
[Julia] Silence. You've missed your turn.
[Julia] Silence. You've missed your turn. I asked you to take the freeway.
Oh, you know what? This way is much faster.
-Excuse me? -Yeah, you seem like you're a rush.
-Excuse me? -Yeah, you seem like you're a rush. And this way is faster, so...
Yeah, I am in a rush and I know this city.
The freeway would've bypassed all of this lunchtime traffic.
I cannot believe this. Why are you stopping?
'Cause we're here now.
-Next time, follow my instructions, okay? -Oh, yes, ma'am.
Ms. Rossmore?
[judge] The jury has a question that they need answered.
They want to know if the damage award can be higher
than what was previously requested.
Well, your honor...
So how's the driving going?
Oh, look, she is something else.
I know, I've worked for her four years.
She's good, though, she wins every case. And this is a big one.
[judge] One word for you, counselor-settlement.
That means she just won a grip of money.
-She's that good. -Mm-hmm.
My client's willing to talk.
Oh, and she's also impatient so you might want to get out to the car.
Sorry, my bad.
Your honor, the people have no evidence.
-We have evidence. -That is not admissible.
The search warrant gave them the right to search the house, not the car.
-He's right. -Your honor--
-He's right. -Your honor-- The evidence of the drugs is inadmissible.
[criminal lawyer] In that case, your honor, we immediately ask that all the charges be dropped,
and that the case be dismissed without prejudice--
[D.A.] Your honor, we need to get him out of the neighborhood.
Then your officers should've been more careful.
Where is your eyewitness?
He has intimidated the entire community.
Then your office has its work cut out for them.
I'm dismissing all the charges.
Adjourned.
They can't hold me, baby. Mm.
-You're the man. -Thank you.
You want some pizza? All right, I'm gonna bring some for you, all right? I'll be there soon.
All right, I'm gonna bring some for you, all right? I'll be there soon.
-[Jenny laughs] Yes. -I love you.
You know how we do.
-Well, do you see this? -Yeah, I see it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. -Whoa, whoa. -I see.
You looking like a little massa' boy.
Wow, so you had to get yourself another job, huh?
Yeah, I know, feedin' them girls ain't easy, huh?
Here, oh, let me help you out. Let me see what I got in here.
Oh, look at that. Here.
-Take it. -Stop it. Take it. Oh, so what you Mr. Do the right thing?
Take it. Oh, so what you Mr. Do the right thing?
Oh, so you don't want this money. It's okay, I'll take it back.
-You gonna leave me alone? -What you gonna do, baby?
You see that brother right there?
If I even break a nail, he will shut you down.
-[scoffs] -And I'm coming for my daughters.
You don't even want your kids. Huh? Now why would you do all this--
You tried to turn my momma against me.
Huh? You tried to turn my kids against me, it ain't gonna happen, baby.
Yeah, I'm gonna make your life hell, little punk.
Look at him, Joe. I think he gettin' mad.
He ain't gonna do nothing. He's so scared to go back to jail.
Yeah, go on lookin' like a slave.
Go on, suh. Mosey on down.
Go on and drive the car.
[Joe] Let step-and-fetch-it get back to work, now.
Hey, man, nice suit. [Jenny] Step-and-fetch-it. Look at you.
[Jenny] Step-and-fetch-it. Look at you. Lookin' just like a broke down slave.
I must've been a fool having three babies by you.
Ugh, please, yuck! I'm just disgusted with myself.
-Oh, do you think that's him? -I think that's him.
-Hi. -Excuse me.
Is this Ms. Rossmore's car?
Uh, who's asking? -Yup, this is it. -This is it.
-Excuse us. -It's okay.
-No, we got it. -Got it.
We know her. Thank you.
-Okay. Okay -Thank you.
Oh, goodness.
Uh, Ms. Rossmore, you, uh, you have somebody-- -You gonna open my door? -Uh, you have--
-You gonna open my door? -Uh, you have-- -Are you going to open my door? -Mm-hmm.
[Julia] Oh, what are you doing in my car?
It's that time.
-No, no. -Yes.
I just want to celebrate winning this case, okay?
Third and Peachtree, please. I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to pass on the blind date.
I knew she was gonna say that. Didn't I tell you now?
-You're going out. -I can't.
Do you know what your associates are saying about you at the office?
I don't care.
They're saying that you need a man.
Okay, and that you're taking it out on everyone at the office.
And they also say that you would be a nicer person if you just got laid.
-I agree. -[coughs]
I don't need to get laid, as you so eloquently put it.
Yes, you do.
Look, we have been your friends since college. We know what you need.
Well, if you know me so well, you'd know that I don't like blind dates. Ah.
-They all end in disaster. -Julia.
First of all, I have a very, very good feeling about this one, I do.
All right, so, Julia, I heard you was like a lawyer and stuff.
I am. Yeah, so you got this then?
-The--the bill? -Yes.
No, I'm serious though. This' a nice place, I like this...environment.
This' a nice place, I like this...environment. You know, it's gangsta.
Feel like, you know, you could do some things in here.
You know what else is nice?
You got some sexy-ass lips. Mm!
Just wanna bite 'em, argh.
Suck on 'em, suck your lips off your face.
Yeah.
I am gonna kill Cynthia and Brenda. Holla.
You don't want to mess with your boy right here. I mean, if you like pleasure.
Hey, hey!
Hey!
Hey! Hey, come here, man.
Yes, sir.

You know what? This water is gonna be just fine.
So we can just, speed the whole thing along.

I'm sorry, how old are you? Forty, shorty.
-Forty? -Yeah.
You don't think that's too old to start a rap career?
Why everybody keep saying that?
I mean, yeah, but, you know, I'm good, and I got a gimmick.
You got to have a gimmick in this game.
You heard of 50 Cent?
-Yes. -They call me 40 Percent.
Check please! Check. They call me 40-p!
[Julia] Oh, it's official. No, this is my proclamation, Cynthia.
I'm giving up on men.
-Why? -'Cause I'm 31, I've never been married, I don't have any kids,
I don't even have a cat to curl up with,
and because I make six-figures, I can't find a decent man to save my life.
-What was wrong with this guy? -Are you kidding me?
The man had no class, Cyn. No, he had no class.
He was screaming across the restaurant for some scrimps.
-[stifled laugh] -Yeah, scrimps. I don't even know how to spell scrimps.
Am I being unreasonable?
All I want is a man who knows when to hold me,
and rub my feet and make me feel safe. Is that too much to ask?
Not, sweetie, it's all possible if you just relax your standards a little bit.
Girl, whatever. What's up with black men all trying to be down?
All of a sudden, everybody's gotta be down.
Like speaking correct English is somehow uncool.
Like, verb-noun agreement is just too much.
And if I see another black man over 30 in a throwback jersey, girl, I'm gonna scream.
in a throwback jersey, girl, I'm gonna scream.
What was that?
I just saw one.
Julia, I just think you're too hard on some of these guys, okay?
You just need to relax a little bit. Excuse me. I have standards.
Excuse me. I have standards.
Yeah, well, the Pope can't meet your standards. Okay?
And I don't mean to be rude, sweetie, but, I got a man waiting for me, and I gots to go.
I got a man waiting for me, and I gots to go.
No, go. No, go, it's cool.
Don't, don't hate. I'm not hatin', Cyn.
[Cynthia] All right, you sound just like-- No, my battery's dying anyway.
Wait, I can't-- I--can't-- -[voice breaking up] -Hello?
You gotta be kidding me. I am so sorry--
-You gotta be kidding me. -I'm sorry.
You're gonna answer it. You know what, I gotta get this one.
Uh, this is my neighbor and she got my kids. Excuse me.
Unbelievable.
Hold up. Okay. You're on company time. You're not supposed to be taking personal calls.
You're on company time. You're not supposed to be taking personal calls.
Well, what happened? Yeah, I know where it is. I'm on my way.
[Julia] Whoa. Whoa. Where are you taking me?
-Lady-- -I'm being kidnapped.
I'm being kidnapped! Somebody help!
-Stop. -You stop, 'cause you're in big trouble, pal.
Look, lady, look, I'm sorry--
No, no, no, you're gonna be sorry.
You know, you have a big problem 'cause you're fired! Fired!
I have a problem right now and I'm so tired
I have a problem right now and I'm so tired of your stuck-up ass giving me a hard time.
Now, do me a favor. Sit back, shut up, and ride, okay?
Thank you.
I do not believe this.
No way. No way. No. No, he didn't do this.
Excuse me? I'm Monty James, you have my kids here?
Have a seat. Someone will be with you in a minute.
Are they here?
Excuse me, are they all right?
-Have a seat, sir. -Where are they?
Excuse me, excuse me. Where are they?
Have a seat, sir.
Did he take--he took the keys. He took the keys.
-[honking] -Fabulous.
I'm just gonna call, who can I call?
Oh, my battery's dead. Great.
No. No. Julia, no. You're in control, here, and...
here, and... You're just gonna walk in there and demand he take you home.
Take me home, wodie. No, that--do they say that? No.
Take me home, Brother.
Yes.
Hey. Look, I try to support black-owned businesses,
but this is absolutely ridiculous. Take me home now.
Monty, Ms. Rossmore--
Monty, Ms. Rossmore-- Maya, what are you doing here?
I live next door to your-- Monty. Your driver.
Well, he's not my driver after tonight, thank you very much.
Next time you want to recommend a little car service to me, Maya,
make sure it's not one of your buddies from the hood, okay?
Maya, what happened?
Well, there was a fire, and then--
Uh, Jennifer Jackson, Monty James? [Monty] Yeah, right here.
Laurie Bell, department of social services.
Are my kids all right? Where they at?
They're fine, they're being looked after. Mr. James, this could've been really bad.
I know, I know. I had to work tonight, and, um, the oldest one,
and, um, the oldest one, she's old enough to look after the little ones--
And I live right next door.
This is my neighbor here-- Well, your daughter started a fire.
Now, I'm sure it was an accident. The fire wasn't that bad, but if your neighbor had not broken down the door,
The fire wasn't that bad, but if your neighbor had not broken down the door,
your daughters could've died of smoke inhalation.
Now we're gonna have to look after your daughters for a little while.
Oh, no, no, this is a mistake--
It's a mistake that could've gotten them killed, Mr. James.
Now, you can call about visitation,
but for now, they're in custody of their mother.
No, ma'am, no, no. No. Uh, let me talk to the little one, please?
No. Uh, let me talk to the little one, please?
-Look, all right-- -Mr. James-- Mr. James, I'm sorry.
-Go get my kids. Just go get my kids-- -Come on, Mrs. Jackson.
Hold on, hold on--
And my mother had the nerve to think that you would do a better job than me.
So I guess this right here is a better job?
Almost killing my kids?
-Just go get little China-- -No, go get nothin'.
You know we gonna get custody now, right?
And we'll enjoy raising your little girl-- No, you won't!
-You want to start with me? -Give me a reason.
-You want to start something, Monty? -Monty!
You picked the wrong person to mess with.
-[man] Yeah, yeah. -Back up. This is not the place.
All right. Let me get my kids, man, just let me get my kids, man.
-Got you, player. -What you say--
-Got you, player. -What you say-- Monty.
Is he gonna take me home?
How old are your girls?
Five, seven, and twelve.
Look, I'm sorry about before. Are they gonna be okay?
If you don't mind, I don't want to talk about it.
I'm sorry.
[Willie] Yeah. Uh, he's walking in right now.
I promise you I'll take care of it myself.
Please, please forgive me. Thank you for your business.
What? I told you I couldn't do it.
I told you, man, I'm glad she called and fired me.
You feel sorry for them girls.
You get that court date yet? Custody hearing's in seven days.
I called like, like nine lawyers this morning,
they all said the same thing. They need more money and more time.
Don't look at me. I just feel like, you know, I make two steps forward, I gotta make four steps back.
I just feel like, you know, I make two steps forward, I gotta make four steps back.
All Ms. Kat asked me to do was raise them kids.
And, I can't even do that.
You know Jennifer and that crack dealer,
they got long money.
You gonna need some help from God and two more white people to fight them.
So my assignment today is to encourage your faith by using what Paul said.
He says, "And let us not grow weary in well-doing."
He said, "For in due season, you shall reap if you faint not."
Now, what I'm trying to tell you... ...is that God is faithful.
And in His faithfulness, he reminds us that in doing good, you shall get weary.
he reminds us that in doing good, you shall get weary.
There's no sin in getting weary, the sin is giving up,
because I'm here to announce to you,
you're so close to your due season, you're about to taste it, there's about to be a manifestation of God--
you're about to taste it, there's about to be a manifestation of God--
...in your life, and it's not time to throw in the towel.
It's time to lift up your head, because something's about to happen in your life,
and God's gonna ensure it.
The evidence that you're so close to your breakthrough,
the evidence that you're so close to your payday
and your reward for walking righteous is that you will feel like, you better hear this
is that you will feel like, you better hear this -I'm telling you something... -[cheering]
...you will feel like you're about to faint.
And when you feel like you're about to faint, don't faint.
Because that says that I'm right there next to my miracle.
I'm right there, right at the door of my due season.
I'm talking to those that walked into this church today
with their head kind of hung down,
and just about to give up and about to lose your faith.
I'm encouraging you, keep the faith!
Stay right there. Don't faint. Hold on.
God is about to bring your due season!
And you need to give Him praise, you need to bless His name,
you need to tell him, I'm still holding on.
God bless you, God bless you, and god bless you.
You know how you working my man's nerve with that whining?
You think I'm gonna let you come in between me and my man with all that mess? You gonna stop that.
me and my man with all that mess? You gonna stop that.
I want my daddy. Well, you ain't goin' back to your daddy.
-Why? -Because I said so, that's why.
You gonna stay right here with me.
And you're goin'. China, you gonna stop that whining.
And you're goin'. China, you gonna stop that whining. China, get in there, get in there.
You gonna stay here with me, you ain't going back to your daddy.
Now you get in there until you figure that out. -[China screams] -Get in there.
Lauryn, go in there with her. Go talk to your sister.
I gotta tell you something, now, y'all better be glad I know Jesus.
[sighs] Y'all get on my nerves.
Thank you, Father! ♪ I can't love you any more ♪
...really good. I'm over here.
Mm-hmm, selling drugs right out here in front of this holy place.
[Maya] Oh, my goodness. You know what? They need to be stopped.
Janis' son got caught selling in school, and said he got it from him.
He comes to school and recruits the kids, babies, Monty.
Mm-hmm. And then he sends them to go sell.
You know, Monty, you really need to come to this community meeting.
Monty, a lot of people respect you in this neighborhood,
and they still remember.
Hmm. -You should come to one of the meetings. -I know.
I'm praying for you, and for you to get your girls back.
-I'll baby-sit anytime, okay? -Oh, I'll baby-sit, too.
Honey, the devil never wins, unless you don't fight.
Yeah. You're right. All right, well, I'll see you all later.
Yeah. You're right. All right, well, I'll see you all later. Okay, baby.
Oh, I'm going back in for a piece of cake.
Give Danny your change.
Now, you know, baby, you're old enough to understand some things, okay.
All right?
Now, you ain't gonna just be sitting around here living off of me.
You got that?
Hey, look at me while I'm talking to you.
Look at me while I'm talking to you, I said.
Don't you dare not look at me.
It's time for you to start your own hustle. -No, no, no. No. -What do you mean, "no"?
-No, no, no. No. -What do you mean, "no"?
-Are you telling me-- -I'm not a hustler.
No, you--you-- You gonna be whatever I tell you gonna be.
I'm trying to teach you how never to be broke another day in your life.
The number one rule to the game
is never get caught.
You got that?
Now, I'm about to go get a drink.
You want one?
Willie's garage. Can I help you?
Hold on.
Monty, telephone.
Yo.
Yeah?
What?
We called her mother, but no one answered.
This kind of thing is frowned upon, Mr. James.
Yes, sir.
C.C., where'd you get this from? Huh?
Go ahead and answer me.
Joe.
-Joe gave you this? -Who is Joe?
-Joe gave you this? -Who is Joe? Joe is, uh, her mother's boyfriend.
What is wrong with you, C.C.?
-Huh? Did you lose your mind? -I don't want you to die.
What are you talking about?
He said if I didn't do it, he was gonna get one of his boys to take you out.
And Joe's crazy, Daddy. He'll do it. -I know he will. -It's okay.
-I know he will. -It's okay.
Hey, didn't I tell you not to call him? These are my kids. He has no right to my kids.
These are my kids. He has no right to my kids.
Did you give this to my daughter to sell?
-Is this punk talking to me? -No, I don't think so.
-I'll take that as a yes. -Look, man--
Daddy!
I got you now. Look at him. Look at him.
-Security, get up here now. -You want to play?
-Daddy! -Right away. The principal's office.
Let him go! [Joe] I run this, man. Ain't nothing you can do about it.
[Joe] I run this, man. Ain't nothing you can do about it. -These are my streets! -It's okay, baby.
-These are my streets! -It's okay, baby.
Do yourself a favor, Monty, live.
'Cause if you keep coming at me the way you coming at me,
we won't need a custody hearing, you heard me?
-[Jennifer] Stop it, Sierra. -Let me go!
Oh, daddy's all right. -Daddy's all right. -Daddy, please, can we go?
-Daddy's all right. -Daddy, please, can we go? [Jennifer] Sierra, come on.
-Sierra. -You're all right.
I'm gonna--look, it's gonna be all right.
I can't take you now.
-Sierra, come on. -Let me go!
-Don't grab her like that. -Stop it, both of you.
I love you, all right?
-Stop grabbing her like that. -What you doing, sierra? Huh?
It's gonna be all right, C.C.
What the deal? Why you gonna come up in here...
If you come up in front of me again, I swear to God,
If you come up in front of me again, I swear to God, you'll never see another daylight in your life.
-[man] Good morning. -Hi.
Excuse me.
...Exactly, and your eight o'clock appointment is all set.
-Okay. -Mr. Farnberg called.
Oh, and I was able to reschedule your hair appointment for next Tuesday.
-Okay. -Also...
What? Hey. What are you doing in here? I need, I needed to talk to you.
That's what I was trying to tell you, Mr. James is here.
Yeah, obviously. Did you just let him in my office?
Well, he said he's here to drive you home.
Call security. No, you ain't gotta call security.
I don't know what I was thinking coming here talking to you.
I'll just leave. I'm sorry.
What do you want from me?
I gotta talk to you about my kids.
-Maya, can you give us a second, please? -Yes, ma'am.
I gotta get my girls back.
Okay, what you need is a family law attorney, okay.
And if you can't afford one, the court will appoint one.
I can't walk in there with a public lawyer.
Their mama is spending a lot of money on a lawyer, and I need a bulldog like you--
Their mama is spending a lot of money on a lawyer, and I need a bulldog like you-- No offense.
Look, our firm charges $500 an hour. Can you afford that?
I got $1,200 to my name. -Look, mister... -No, no. Just call me Monty.
-Look, mister... -No, no. Just call me Monty. Look, sister, I'm trying to get--
-Typical. Typical. -What?
I thought more of you, but it's real typical. I'm not your sister, okay?
I don't appreciate you coming into my office asking for favors,
playing the race thing. It's sad and it's pathetic.
What are you getting out of this? -Hmm? -What?
Why do you want your daughters back so badly?
You getting a check for them, or some sort of government assistance?
Go to hell.
Wow. That, that, my friend, is exactly how you get what you want--
Insult me. Great strategy. I see why you're so successful.
Get a man, get a life.
Thank you.
Excuse me, are any of you ladies named Julia?
-No. -No.
Sorry to bother you.
Julia?
-Christopher? -Yes.
-Please, call me Chris. -Sure.
-May I? -Oh, please. Sorry.
Um, I'm sorry for staring,
it's just that you're beautiful than your friend said.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
-So, you're a lawyer. -Yes, I am.
Me, too. -Really? -Mm-hmm.
Mostly corporate stuff, tax stuff, it's pretty boring. What about you?
Our firm handles some criminal, some civil.
-Okay. What firm? -Rossmore and Blake.
Oh.
-Hmm. -What? I applied for a job there, and they turned me down.
I applied for a job there, and they turned me down.
Said that my resume was a little bit shallow.
That's what the old fart said.
What's he...How's he doing these days?
He, uh, retired to Florida.
Oh, you keep up with him?
He's my father, the fart.
Check, please.
I'm sorry. That was embarrassing.
Don't worry about it.
He can be a little tough on people he doesn't know that well.
Hmm. Well, they must be big wingtips to fill.
Actually, I try to fill my own stilettos.
Touche. And I will try to keep my foot out of my mouth
for the rest of this conversation.
It's cute. You should leave it there.
[chuckles] Well, if it's what the lady like, then I will.
Oh, I like.
Would you like anything to drink?
Um, a latte would be great.
Okay. Coming right up.
Thank you, Jesus.
So, I had an amazing time.
This was one of the best dates I've ever been on.
Me, too.
I would like to see you again.
Yeah? I'd like that.
Who the hell is this, Chris?
Uh, this is, uh...
-Baby, you're supposed-- -Who are you?
-Baby, you're supposed-- -Who are you? I was--i was just saying good-bye, ma'am.
Yeah, you better go, slut. You see, right now, this is his family.
Get away from my daddy, tramp! -Junior, i-- -Excuse me!
-Junior, i-- -Excuse me! You trying to be playing playa, huh?
Where is your wedding ring? I am so tired of you! Get in the car!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Where's your lawyer? Uh, sir, I can't afford one,
but I do have all my paperwork, Your Honor.
-And-- -Are you ready to begin?
Uh, yes, sir.
-My kids were taken from me-- -The court is aware of that.
But first, I'd like to hear about the incident that happened at school.
Your honor, he gave my daughter weed to sell in school, so I had--
Mr. James has no evidence to support that allegation.
However, we have documentation that demonstrates
that Mr. James has a history of violent behavior.
Your Honor, look, I'm caught between a rock and a hard place here.
You know, the courts won't help me. My daughters are living with this man.
You know, what am I supposed to do right here?
[lawyer] Your Honor, not only are we requesting full custody with no visitation,
but also a restraining order against Mr. James.
He assaulted my client and threatened bodily injury.
Your Honor, this man is giving drugs to my kids!
What proof of that do you have? Absolutely none--
-Your honor? -Ms. Rossmore.
I'll be representing Mr. James.
I'd like to request a continuance at this time
so I might be brought up to speed.
[lawyer] Your Honor, this has gone on long enough. My client is ready to put this behind her.
Perhaps counsel might like to remind his client
that in family court, it's not what's best for the parent
but rather what's in the best interest of the child.
That being said,
I think these children need effective counsel.
[judge] Ms. Rossmore, you are appointed by the court as guardian for the children.
When I hear this case on the reset date, I want evidence, not just accusations and speculation.
I want evidence, not just accusations and speculation.
This case is continued for 30 days.
[Julia] Your Honor, during that time, we'd like to request full custody
to be granted to the father.
[judge] You're pushing your luck.
Full custody remains with the mother.
Father will have visitation one day a week. Adjourned.
You have really interesting taste in women.
Nah, that's not the girl I met in high school.
Nope. She's changed.
I think the hood has a way of bringing out the best and worst in people.
That's not just the hood, Monty, that's life.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
We had big dreams though. Big dreams. Then, I guess, you know, reality set in.
Big dreams. Then, I guess, you know, reality set in.
Really? What kind of dreams did you have?
I'm a mechanic, and, you know, I wanted to open my own shop.
-Oh. -I'm good with cars, you know, so that's my hustle.
You should open that shop one day.
Well, I had to use the money That I had saved on my kids.
-Oh. -It was worth it though.
You know, I think that parents sometimes,
they gotta give up their dreams so their kids can have one.
Thank you.
-Thank you so much. -All righty.
You giving me hope. Thank you.
Great. Cool. Okay.
Come by tomorrow evening after work. We're gonna have to do all this after hours.
Okay. And if you could bring any receipt that pertains to the kids' expenses
And if you could bring any receipt that pertains to the kids' expenses or anything else you could possibly think of
that can help us win the case... So, thank you.
[Maya] No, no, no. This needs to be addressed. He is the councilman.
[Maya] No, no, no. This needs to be addressed. He is the councilman. He needs to know what the real issues are.
You the one we elected, you supposed to do something.
Quite, quite please. One at a time. One at a time.
Yes, you, ma'am.
I'm scared to go to the mailbox on the first because they be watching me.
All right. Yes, sir.
That Joe boy has been selling drugs on this block for years.
Well, have you called the police? What good would that do?
He's been arrested five times, and he keeps coming back.
You gotta do something.
What did I miss?
Oh, more of the same. Still complaining.
Let me tell you why he's gonna keep getting off,
because none of you in this neighborhood will testify against him.
What if we did? I mean, what if we did testify?
Who's gonna protect us?
You--they don't even come when you call them in this neighborhood now.
May I say something please? Yes, sir.
I've been in this neighborhood for almost 67 years.
I watched Dr. King walk this very street to go to the barber shop.
I remember Billie Holiday,
who checked into what used to be the only hotel in the south
that would allow black people, right here on Auburn Avenue.
What I remember most was we used to be a people that would take care of ourselves.
Nobody never gave us nothing. We all earned it.
We look at these politicians and ask for their help. It ain't up to them. It's up to us.
It ain't up to them. It's up to us.
And if we all stand up together, then maybe they'll come and help us.
That's the history of us as a people.
We have to get our neighborhood back.
[Monty] Wow, I can see my whole neighborhood up here.
It ain't but five, ten blocks, but,
it's a whole different world out there.
And the highway run right through-- -Monty, I have a question. -Yeah?
When did you and their grandmother file this with the family court?
Oh, pardon me. It was like a, a month before the fire.
There. See the date? Thank you.
So, you've been supporting these children their whole lives?
-Yeah. -Hmm.
"Hmm," what? No, you should be proud of that.
I'm--that's all I'm saying. You should be proud of that, it's...
I mean, judging from these passed years
tax returns and how much you spend on them, it's commendable.
Don't be surprised.
I mean, I know the world will have you thinking
that, you know, brothers in hood don't look after their kids, but,
I mean, I know there's some that don't, but I do.
I love my kids, and I want them back.
Oh, well, you know, I think, I think we have enough info here
I think, I think we have enough info here to begin preparing a really, really solid case.
You know, there's something I have to ask though.
Yeah? Are there any surprises in your past that I should know about?
Are there any surprises in your past that I should know about?
-[telephone rings] -Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.
Yes?
Cynthia? No. No, no. I know it's 6:30. I'm not going.
'Cause I don't want to go on any more blind dates.
He was a 40-year-old rapper. No, I didn't hear his demo tape.
Bye. Uh--bye. Thank you, bye.
Sorry.
Why did you, Why'd you go on them dates?
Why'd you go on them blind dates? Excuse me?
When I was driving you, you know, you had your home girl set you up on a blind date and I'm like,
on a blind date and I'm like, "Why you need that? You're so beautiful."
You really want to know?
I need to...[chuckles] I mean, I need to know. I mean...
Because it's really hard to meet a nice black man.
It--it is! It is.
And when you're in corporate America, like me,
the people you work with don't look like you.
And if you're a black woman that wants to actually date a black man,
kind of difficult.
No, seriously. And if you want a black man that has good credits,
actually wants to date a black woman... Mm-hmm.
...and doesn't play video games,
Good luck. Well, I love me some black women.
Where's my money?
I don't have it.
We can see that.
[Joe] Oh, well, that's $700, kid.
See, now the problem is, that comes from queen bee's account.
And, as you can see, she a little pissed off about it.
Baby, you want to call this one?
Oh, baby, you gonna let me do it? -Oh, for sure. -Oh.
Go do what you do.
Now, kick his ass.
That's 150, 275!
That's a good 350 right there. Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!
Man, okay! Okay! Get him up out of here. Get him up out of here.
Get him up out of here!
Yo, light up my blowtorch. I'll be down there in about 20 minutes.
What you laughing for? That ain't funny!
I'm laughing at you, 'cause, baby, he deserves to be beat. Okay?
'cause, baby, he deserves to be beat. Okay?
It's a tough world out here, And I'm getting you ready for it.
Ain't nothing given to you, girl? No, you got to take it.
Now, I'm gonna wipe those little sweet dreams out of your head, okay, baby,
Now, I'm gonna wipe those little sweet dreams out of your head, okay, baby, if it's not the last thing that I do.
Now, get your little black ass back in that bedroom before I have to smack it.
You looking at me though!
Oh, I'm about to come in there in a minute. I got a big belt.
[Julia] Okay, I think that's about enough for tonight.
[Monty] So, how's it looking? [Julia] Good. Good. I think we're gonna do well.
Come on. I'll walk you to your car. Thank you. Mm-hmm.
You know what? I forgot. I let my driver go home early.
Oh, well, you know, I'll take you home.
Thank you.
Is this how you're spending your birthday? -It's just another day. -Wow.
-It's just another day. -Wow. How old are you?

I called you twice yesterday. I know. I've been busy.
Excuse me. Coffee, ma'am? Uh, yes. Decaf, please. Thanks.
What? Oh, hell, no.
What are you talking about?
Only good sex can make you smile like that.

But there's someone.
Thanks. -You're glowing. -Who is it?
Come on, give up the goods, girl. -What was-- -No. No. No.

Yeah, to relax them, honey, not lay them down by the riverside.
I don't know about this. Where does he live?
Edgewood.
[together] Edgewood?
-Edgewood. -Edgewood?
What does your Ivy League background know about Edgewood?
Nothing.
And what do you know about Edgewood? Nothing.
What could you two possibly have to talk about?
They ain't gonna be talking.
-Cynthia. -What?
Your client's last settlement, his baby-mamma drama.
-How do you know he has kids? -Because. Are you kidding me?
-How do you know he has kids? -Because. Are you kidding me? It's not if he has kids, it's how many.
-Does he have kids? -How many?
-Three. -He has three children?
I'm so disappointed.
Are they all by the same mother?
No, probably not.
Yes, they all have the same mother, I think. But it doesn't matter.
Just be careful. Don't fall for this guy, I'm telling you.
He will run up your credit,
have you in the swats wearing knock-off Gucci--
-Brenda. -What? Relax, all right? She's not married.
She's just having fun.
Right? You're having fun. You're not falling in love.

Well, you know, I just thought I'd come check up on you.

Great. Sounds good. All right. My place ain't as fly as yours, But, uh, how's seven o'clock?
My place ain't as fly as yours, But, uh, how's seven o'clock? That sounds great. That's great.

Julia.
Ain't that a white-girl name? Okay, now, we're supposed to be nice.

Oh, it's no problem, really.
Well, you could try a little harder.

-Migraines. -Bad migraines.
-I'm sorry. I'm trying. -Really bad.
-Hey. -Hey. -You made it. -Yeah.
-Hey, daddy. -Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Sierra?
Bye.
Bye.
[Julia] Tell me what you know.
You know what? I'll tell you what I do know.
I know that you, you're feeling me. But you won't let yourself go there because you,
But you won't let yourself go there because you, you care more about what people think than your own happiness.
Am I right?
We can both act like, you know, the other night never happened, but we both know it did.
We can both act like, you know, the other night never happened, but we both know it did. I was drunk.
-No, no. -No, I was drunk.
You was being yourself, and like my momma used to say, God rest her soul,
a drunk man never tells no tales.
What?
-Touche. -Yeah.
So, your mom passed? Yeah.
My mom passed. I'm sorry to hear that.
-What about your dad? -Who?
-Your dad. -My dad. I don't know my dad.
I got a whole bunch of brothers and sisters that I don't know, but that's cool.
that I don't know, but that's cool.
It's funny how life works out.
You never knew your dad, but my dad would have killed for a boy.
-For a boy. -For a boy.
-Didn't get one. -I know the feeling.
That man pushed me so hard. God.
[sighs] Well, I made partner in the firm before I was 28.
My parents retired to south beach.
I don't know, Ms. Julia. You know what? You and I,
I don't know, Ms. Julia. You know what? You and I, we come from two different worlds, but,
well, there's something going on here, right?
-You want me to stop? -No.
-No? -No.
Oh, you on time today. Well, you know, I gotta--
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?
Oh, some thugs tried to break in here.
I fought them out. Before that happened, one of them cut me.
-Are you all right? -Yeah, yeah. I'm all right.
Well, did you catch 'em?
It was just some, some crackhead trying to get some stuff.
Now, I'm getting too old for this, man. I'm tired of it.
They win.
You know, I was thinking,
I gotta get rid of this place. I gotta leave this neighborhood.
So, if you could get together what you can for a down payment,
and then you hit me up once a month
until we reach ten, plus interest,
you can have this place.
Would you do that?
I mean, sure. What are you, what are you saying? You serious, man?
Yeah. This place is officially yours.
I mean, I didn't want it like this. No. Me neither.
You'll have to... You gotta let me come back and help you from time to time.
Any time you're ready, man.
All right.
Oh, man.
Congratulations.
Is he gonna be all right?
He'll be fine.
Oh, wow, wow, wow. I see it. Oh, look at that.
-Do you see it, Ms. Julia? -I do. -Yeah. -Wow.
So, you know, I'm mad excited.
I'm gonna get my sign for my new garage.
-I know. -I know.
-Sounds great. -I know. I'm really excited about that.
-Congratulations. -Mm-hmm.
Julia? -Hey. -Hey.
-Hey. -Hey. What are you doing here?
-Nothing, we were just... -I'm Monty.
I remember you. Okay.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah.
What are you doing with this man? -Look, we're just hanging out. -Are you serious? You like him?
-Look, we're just hanging out. -Are you serious? You like him?
He's a nice guy.
Snap out of it, Julia.
You are a partner at your firm. The only black woman at that level.
What do you think your partners would think if they knew
you were sleeping around with the help?
Are you trying to ruin your life? [man] Whoa, whoa.
-Hey, Julia. How you doing? -Good. How you doing?
-Hey, baby, you ready? -Yeah.
Come on, guys.
I think there'll be some people who are disappointed in me about this.
I mean, you know who I am. I'm, I'm from the streets.
-I can't change that. -I'm not trying to change you.
-Do I embarrass you? -No.
I mean, it's obvious that I do, and that's okay. That's okay.
You just gotta tell me that.
Tell me the truth, so that way, I know how to deal with it.
Look, I don't, I don't know how I feel. Okay?
But I can't sit here and lie to you and say that I don't think about
But I can't sit here and lie to you and say that I don't think about who you are and what you have.
I do.
You have three daughters.
One of whom is almost as big as I am.
This is new for me, Monty, and it's different, and I'm trying.
I am trying, and you gotta give me credit for that.
Can we finish this conversation? Come on.
-No. -No? What do you--what...
I got my girls for, like, two more hours,
and I'm not gonna waste my time dealing with this.
But I will tell you something.
-You don't have three girls in your life, just you. -Monty. Monty.
-Monty. -Big guy, ain't he?
-He's pretty. -Ain't he?
-Look at that one. -Look at that one. He's bigger than all of them.
Yeah.
No, he did not bring this chick to my house either.
Watch the seatbelt. -Okay, Daddy. -Come on.
See you later. [Jennifer] Come on. Y'all, hurry up.
Bye, Ms. Julia. All right.
-I love you. -You, too. Now, be good, all right?
-[Jennifer] Come on, y'all. -My butterfly. Go ahead.
Come on, y'all. Hurry up.
Shoot, I been standing out here all night, and I'm tired, too.
Y'all think y'all the only ones tired? Shoot, and y'all...
Just let me explain, Monty.
The last man that I loved, he hurt me to my soul.
We were together six years, and,
he told me it was over two days before his wedding.
I trusted him with everything.
And I've never felt so low and stupid and humiliated in my life.
And so I told myself not to think about you.
But I couldn't, 'cause I do all the time.
So, what are you saying?
I'm saying that I've been running from something that already happened, and I'm saying that
that already happened, and I'm saying that I fell in love with you, Monty James,
And I'm saying that I hope I'm not in this alone.
You're not.
You're not alone.
Come here.
Your Honor, the children's own grandmother,
their maternal grandmother at that, went down to child welfare
and prepared a written statement
as to why the children should be placed with their father.
Let me see that.
Did you know about this? [Jennifer] Oh, I don't know nothing about this.
I don't know what they trying to pull now.
Your Honor, my client has the means to take care of these girls,
and she wants to take care--
Iit says here that her mother thought the means were ill-gotten.
Well, that's-- that's pure-- [judge] What do you do for living, Ms. Jackson?
Well, I--well, I don't work, Your Honor. But my boyfriend does.
What does he do?
Well, he, you know, I mean, he owns his own businesses.
[judge] And where are the tax returns?
Well, you know, we was working on getting 'em,
and you know what, Your Honor? You keep asking me about my stuff.
You need to be asking Monty about some of his secrets,
'cause he got a whole lot of 'em.
What is she talking about?
[lawyer] Your Honor, Mr. James was convicted of the rape of a 16-year-old girl 16 years ago, and we're afraid for the safety of the children.
16 years ago, and we're afraid for the safety of the children.
Counselor, what do you have to say about this?
I wasn't aware, Your Honor.
[lawyer] It's right here in black and white. Yeah, he was sentenced to eight years,
has been on probation ever since his release.
I'll take this matter under advisement.
I need to review the circumstances of this case.
Adjourned.
So, how long has he been screwing you, huh? 'Cause I know he can't afford you.
-Move. -Hey. -Move. -Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'll have to tap that ass.
-Move. -Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'll have to tap that ass.
Let me explain. Let me explain something.
-Get away from me. -Hold on. Hold on. Let me--
-Get your hands off of me! -Wait, let me explain.
-Get your hands off of me! -Wait, let me explain. -You know what? Shut up! -Shut the hell up!
-You know what? Shut up! -Shut the hell up! I can't even stand to look at you right now.
I asked you if there were any surprises. You said no. You're a rapist.
You said no. You're a rapist.
You don't think that's something I should have known about?
-Julia, let me-- -Don't you touch me!
Julia, look, look. Look--
Let me ask you a question. Did you or did you not go to jail for rape?
-Julia, look-- -Did you go to jail--
-Julia, look! -Did you go to jail for rape, Monty?
-Yes. -That's all I need to know.
-No, I-- -You know what? It doesn't even matter 'cause you're a liar, Monty.
You're a filthy, God, you're filthy liar. This case is over.
You're a filthy, God, you're filthy liar. This case is over. Maya will call you and tell you when to return for the ruling.
You don't need me any more, Monty, And I certainly don't need you.
So, you like him that much?
-I fell in love with him. -Oh, Julia.
Sweetie, this was supposed to be a fun thing, not a love thing.
I know.
Go ahead, Bren. Tell me I told you so.
Oh, girl, you know I'm not gonna do that.
It's just good that you found out now.
I'm with Brenda on this.
Julia, this guy was probably just after your money.
He wasn't even like that.
You know, you guys, he was a hard worker. You know, I mean, and he treated, God, he treats those girls
You know, I mean, and he treated, God, he treats those girls like they are princesses.
Well, let's not forget he has a record.
How'd I not know he was lying?
Because he's probably really good at it. They all are.
It's like I'm, I'm hearing it, you guys, and I'm trying to understand, but I just--it-- it doesn't make sense.
but I just--it-- it doesn't make sense.
You know?
And I can't make my brain believe that it was all a lie.
Is it as bad as it sounds?
Honey, it's as bad as it sounds.
Jules, just... Do yourself a favor.
Forget about this guy.
He sounds like a lot of trouble.
Okay?
I just want to say...
It was like a...
[automated voice] Hi, this is Julia. Leave a message.
Who that?
What you all doing here? Come on in here.
What you all doing here?
Huh? Where your mama at?
What happened, C.C.? What happened?
Daddy, we don't really care what the judge says.
We just want to be with you.
I'm staying here.
-How did y'all get here? -We walked.
Y'all walked at three o'clock in the morning?
We can't stay there anymore, Dad. I'm sorry.
What you talking...
-Daddy? -What happened? Joe...
Joe what? C.C., you can talk to me. You tell me what, what happened?
-Joe keeps-- -He keeps what?
Joe keeps hitting China.
What?
Where? Come here. Where?
-On my back. -On your back?
And mama was sitting right there. She didn't even say anything.
He hit--hold on. Hold on a second. Come here. He hit you? Hmm?
He hit me because I wouldn't stop crying.
Okay. Daddy, I was so sad. I couldn't help it.
Okay, come here. Come here. We...
Grandma told me, Grandma told me to look after you all.
I gotta look after you all. Mmm?
So, y'all gonna stay with me now.
Y'all gonna stay with me now, okay?
Okay?
C.C., I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.
Okay. You're gonna stay with me. It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.
[man] Ah. Wait. Hold up.
Monty. Monty! Man, come on!
There's some girls over here, man!
Monty, what are you doing, man?
Come on! What's taking you so long.
-[Monty] I'm Monty. -We know who you are.
You beat our team.
-How old are you? -Eighteen.
You know, this sure is a nice place you have here.
Um, you want to see my room?
-[Monty] Sure. -[girl] So, you gonna call me?
[Monty] Probably not. Oh, you're just like all the other guys.
Mandy, what are you doing? Did he force you?
-[Monty] No way! Tell him! -Mandy?
-Yes, Daddy. -What?
Sir, I didn't do anything. -Shut up! -I didn't do anything.
-Shut up! -I didn't do anything. Shut up! -It was her idea. -Shut up, superstar!
-Tell him! -Call the police.
I didn't do anything. Tell him, Amanda. If you don't tell him the truth, I'm going to jail. Tell him the truth!
If you don't tell him the truth, I'm going to jail. Tell him the truth! Your ball days are over! You got me?
Your ball days are over! You got me? -I didn't do nothing! -Shut up right now!
-I didn't do nothing! -Shut up right now!
[Julia] Get your hands off of me. I can't even stand to look at you.
You're a rapist! [echoing] You're a rapist! You're a rapist!
[Jennifer] I bet you he won't ever take our money again.
[Joe] I know that's right. You gotta keep 'em straight, J.
You know I got your back, right, baby?
That's why you my girl.
You know, I want to go see that movie with the dude with the ax,
no, no, no, it's the chainsaw.
Baby, you know, if we went to see that movie--
Check it out.
Oh, snap! Load up! Load up!
Do something!
[newscaster] Tthere was a near-riot today in the Edgewood community.
Police officers were called in to break up a fight
between local gang members and residents who had had enough.
Among those arrested was Monty James.
You may remember Monty James, a high school basketball star
who was falsely convicted in 1990
for allegedly having non-consensual sex with a 17-year-old girl--
I'm assuming you have admissible evidence this time?
Yes, Your Honor.
The police seized several pounds of marijuana hidden in the defendant's vehicle.
of marijuana hidden in the defendant's vehicle.
A subsequent search of the residence
turned up several kilograms of crack cocaine.
This time, Your Honor, we have a valid warrant.
Your Honor, even though they served the search warrant, they still have no witnesses.
Your Honor, I'll testify.
Congratulations! It looks like you have a case.
Take them into custody. There will be no bond.
-Next case. -Wait, get your hand off me!
[bailiff] The state of Georgia versus Monty James.
Order! Order in this court!
All of you, be quiet! Or I'll have you removed!
I will have order!
Order!
Order!
I said order!
Who's here for the defense?
I am, Your Honor.
Ms. Rossmore?
May I take a second, please?
What you doing here?
I'm sorry. I didn't give you a chance to explain, and if you don't ever want to speak to me again,
I didn't give you a chance to explain, and if you don't ever want to speak to me again, I completely understand.
Let me help you.
Monty, just let me help you.
Just get me back to my kids.
Ms. Rossmore?
Your Honor, there's no evidence my client committed any criminal act.
The state has no case against him.
We demand a preliminary hearing
and request the state be required to show probable cause.
Your Honor, I'm sure that one of these witnesses can attest to the fact that Mr. James
can attest to the fact that Mr. James drove his vehicle into the previous defendant's vehicle.
It was an accident.
I'm sure that the subsequent fistfight was an accident also then, counselor.
Where are the witnesses?
Your Honor, the entire neighborhood saw this.
I'm sure we have a witness.
May I have one of the witnesses. Please stand at this time?
-Your Honor-- -I'm dismissing the case.
I love you.
And I'm sorry for everything.
[Monty] Oh, man! Forget about it! I can't believe this! Yo! The whole neighborhood!
I can't believe this! Yo! The whole neighborhood!
[alll] Daddy!
Come here, baby.
Two men.
Approximately
40 goats.
They're not on anybody's side. We don't have to shoot them.
Egress?
Primary over the top, secondary down the road, tertiary to the river.
No one can track you through the water except a fish.
Sarah's headed off to nursing' school next month.
She sewed that herself.
It's beautiful.
You sure this is a peacekeeping mission?
Normally there isn't any peace to start with.
This shit's awful calm.
-Not at these coordinates. -Yes, sir.
Go ahead and plot an alternate.
Yes, sir.
[man over radio] Command Post, Command Post, this is TS-129, over.
Sir, I have visual confirmation of TS-129's current position.
[man 1] Mission accomplished, en route to extract site. Distance eight klicks. Over.
[Donnie] Command Post, Command Post, this is Viper.
I have friendly forces moving towards extraction point, over.
Heads up, our boys are coming through.
[man] Viper, this is CP. Be advised,
possible hostile forces approaching TS-129 at their twelve o'clock.
[Swagger] Call them out.
Target.
Sector Bravo, deep.
Vehicle, belt-fed weapon.
Range it.
870 yards and closing.
Wind, three-quarter value, push two left.
900 yards. Wide spot on the road.
On target.
Hold scope.
Fire when ready.
Hit.
[Donnie] Command Post, this is Viper. Hostile threat down, over.
[man] Viper, this is Command Post. We copy your traffic, over.
Call it in. It's time to go.
Command Post, this is Viper. Mission accomplished.
-Packing up. -Shit!
[man] Viper, be advised [gunfire] larger hostile forces approaching near sector Bravo.
Weren't supposed to be hostiles that close!
Crooked tree. 675, 30 miles an hour, three-mil lead.
Position to machine gun. 900, three-quarter value.
Fire when ready.
Jefe. 920. Three-quarter value.
I see it, Donnie. I see it. Fire when ready.
[Donnie] They don't know where we are. But they might get lucky!
[Donnie] Command Post, Command Post, this is Viper.
Enemy forces have been stopped. Break.
Friendlies are continuing on to extract point. Break.
We're receiving small arms and indirect fire from hostile troops. Break.
Command Post, do you read me?
Shut it down.
They're highly-trained men,
eight kilometers inside a country we are not supposed to be in.
I'm sure they'll get out just fine. Shut it down now.
[Donnie] Radio check. Do you read me?
-Okay, wrap it up. Let's go! -Do you read me?
[man 1] Pull out those tracks. [man 2] Pull out those tracks and pack it up!
Intelligence said they didn't have air support!
Call it in!
Shit! The channel's down!
That's impossible!
The comm link's dead!
They left us here. Don't worry, we're getting home!
[screams] Donnie?
Donnie!
Come on, boy!
Come on, Sam!
What're you doing, huh? What're you doing?
Come on.
What? I got nothing.
What?
All right, come on, let's go. Let's go.
That's a good boy.
Good boy.
Well, let's see what lies they're trying to sell us today.
Here, boy.
Good boy.
[Sandor] Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger.
USMC, retired.
He is the best there is.
[Dobbler] His last assignment went wrong.
Put in unfriendly territory on a loan-out and left as expendable.
Opposing force sent an attack helicopter and a hundred-man company.
His best friend and spotter was killed.
No official report.
Ghost report says he inflicted 70 percent casualties, the rest fled.
The agency asset that left them there to die?
Suddenly removed from the face of the earth two weeks after.
They never laid it at Bob Lee's feet.
He retired a week later.
I guess Bob Lee didn't think he was expendable.
[Johnson] Grows and shoots his own food.
[Dobbler] Yeah, he rarely ventures out at all.
This is a man with a history of duty and patriotism.
Not as punch lines, but as core beliefs. Aye.
Some people don't know what to do when their belief system collapses.
Bob Lee is one of those.
You sure, boy?
Nope. I ain't buying. I don't want any.
You guys turn around and go back to wherever you came from.
Bob Lee Swagger?
My name is Colonel Isaac Johnson.
You're a hard man to find.
But not hard enough.
Come a long way to see you.
We have some business needs your attention.
You wanna use your low gear going down the road or your brakes'll go.
-Come here. Come here, boy. -[Sam snarling] Don't do that.
Come near the porch I didn't invite you, you'd have to shoot the dog.
That's a slow draw you got there.
Sure you want to do that?
Shoot a dog in this county on a man's land,
I'd bury you in the hill, and tell the sheriff a month or two later.
He understands.
Take your hand off your weapon.
Slowly.
So the gunnery sergeant doesn't have to bury you in the hill.
I don't carry a gun.
You know what that is?
It's a Congressional Medal of Honor.
They don't hand those out easy.
Yours?
Yeah.
Your father had one, didn't he?
What did you do?
Something foolhardy. Kept some other boys alive.
Will you give me five minutes?
Yeah, your dog stays outside.
Come on, boy. Get in there.
I need you to plan a presidential assassination.
Whose president?
Ours.
I didn't say "execute".
Plan.
So it can be stopped.
There's gonna be an attempt on the life of the President in the next two weeks.
Code was broken on an anonymous transmission.
It was internal.
We can't go to the usual agencies.
The government itself has been penetrated.
The President has three public engagements during that time.
Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.
Standard Secret Service protective cordon
is out to 880 yards.
But this intercept claims that the shot will be taken from beyond a mile.
We need you to scout, tell us how you would do it,
so we could stop it.
I'm not entirely convinced that a shot like this could be made.
But let's not take the chance.
Your longer shots were never confirmed.
That's because long shots generally go places
you wouldn't wanna have to go afterwards to confirm them.
Confirmation's a desk pogue's problem.
You know what it takes to make a shot at that range?
Everything comes into play that far.
Humidity, elevation, temperature, wind, spindrift.
There's a 6-to-10-second flight time
so you have to shoot at where the target's going to be.
Even the Coriolis effect, the spin of the Earth, comes into play.
President'll be wearing body armor. That means a head shot.
At over a mile.
You believe there's a shooter involved capable of making this shot?
Yes.
Well, then you got a real problem. You need to find the shooter.
That's being worked on from another direction.
We need you to do this.
Don't really like the President much.
Didn't like the one before that much, either.
You like the idea of the President?
Living in a free country?
Do we allow America to be ruled by thugs?
Sure, some years we do.
I believe you stood before a flag
and solemnly swore
that you'd support and defend the Constitution of the United States
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.
I think your five minutes is up.
Listen to me, son.
I don't want you to turn on the TV next week
and see the President dead,
and know you could've done something about it.
Don't do that to yourself.
[Swagger] Is that the new one?
The truck.
You got the big engine in there?
Wow, look at that, huh? Eight-liter V8.
Thing's so big, EPA doesn't even bother to give you the gas mileage for it.
You mind if I take a picture?
This is beautiful.
Someone will be at this number night or day.
You see what he did? He didn't need a photo of the engine.
No, he doesn't give a rat's ass about the engine.
He's trained in counterintel.
Backed up far enough to take a picture of the plates.
This is our guy.
I thought he turned you down.
He said yes. He just doesn't know it yet.
1,760's a mile.
It's a far piece, Sam. Think the President ought to worry?
Yeah, I think he better worry.
Yeah, he'll be fine.
Just feed him once a day. Read him a few ballistics tables if he looks lonely.
Yep. I'm out.
Come here, buddy.
Okay.
Think you'll be able to tough it out without me for a couple days? Huh?
Yeah.
[man on radio] This is Command Post. What's your status? Over.
[man 2] Yeah, we're finishing up here on sixth.
[man 1] Roger that. We copy. Checkpoint down, over.
[man] Before you stands Independence Hall, the birthplace of the United States
and one of the most important buildings in American history.
Built in 1732…
[man 2] Keep a visual eye on 72nd.
…both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution
were debated and signed here.
[Swagger] Out of the three cities,
there's only one with a reasonably high chance of success.
There was no room in Baltimore.
Street isn't wide enough to correct for the windage,
buildings are in the way.
D.C.'s a pure suicide mission.
I mean, unless you're sure your shooter's interested in 70 virgins
waiting for him in the afterlife, I'd rule that out.
Shot's got to be taken from Philly.
From beyond 1,800 yards, though.
It's one of six possible locations,
approximately five stories above the President's location.
Flight time of the bullet that distance is five to six seconds.
They'll have to wait till he takes the podium, several lines into his speech.
That way he'd be completely static, obviously at his most exposed.
Shot requires a large-caliber weapon.
Expect the bullet to be handmade, bronzed alloy turned on a lathe.
Slightly lower ballistics coefficient, touch more slippery.
Least that's what I'd do.
You can kill him from that far away?
Mile and a half, the bullet's going to strike with more energy
than a .44 Magnum point blank. Yeah, I think you can kill him.
The challenge is the wind.
Lightest breeze uncorrected at that distance
is enough to ruin the shot.
He's gonna need indicators between the podium and the shooting position.
Velocity corrections are easy,
but an angle change, that becomes a trig problem.
He's gotta do that in his head on the fly.
Without something to gauge, your shot's just too tough to make cold bore.
[Johnson] Impressive recon and report, son.
Move too soon, we lose him.
We want to take him alive.
If we don't know who hired him, it could just happen again.
We'll have six three-man teams standing by.
Gunnery Sergeant Swagger?
A moment?
You've done your country a great service, son.
-On the day… -Look…
Listen.
You're one of the few people who knows what to look for.
I could use a spotter.
[man] Thank you, Philadelphia.
The President speaks in 20 minutes.
…before you on this stage…
[Johnson] Notify our teams. Check their positions.
…patriots met in Independence Hall and created a document,
the Declaration of Independence…
[officer] Sir?
…and a country, the United States of America,
that changed the world.
Philadelphia is our home. We are…
[man 1 on radio] Stand by, all teams. This is Listening Post.
Flashlight's current location is approaching Checkpoint Jason.
All sniper teams send update on your sitrep.
Stand by. [man 2] Yes, I have a clear line of sight.
[woman on radio] Copy that.
[man] Post 18 clear, over.
[woman] Post 19, please report. What's your status?
All clear. There's really nothing going on here.
[man] The Archbishop of Ethiopia…
[newscaster 1] The President will be awarding the Philadelphia Brotherhood Medal
to His Grace Desmond Mutumbo, the Archbishop of Ethiopia.
[newscaster 2] There's been some controversy surrounding the Archbishop
as he's been speaking out regarding the atrocities
in his country.
He plans to meet with the President right after the ceremony
to discuss these matters.
[Archbishop] These are great times.
[Archbishop] These are historic times.
And these are troubled times, as well.
This medal that your country…
[Swagger] Yellow ribbons.
Yeah, people put those up to remember the troops.
No, they tie those low around trees.
These are windage flags.
Roughly the location I'd have put them in
for a shot from the steeple.
Yeah. Maybe.
No, definitely. He knows what he's doing.
You guys got a team in place to take out the church?
They'll move right before the shot is taken, when his focus is elsewhere.
[Archbishop] …raises its head and confronts freedom,
but slyly, subtly, chokes it off at the root.
And it is our responsibility
to find these dark weeds.
[man] Flashlight has arrived. I say again, Flashlight has arrived.
[woman] If you just joined us…
Officer Timmons, our local resource.
Bob Lee Swagger.
It is a real honor to meet you.
You're unsnapped, officer.
Shit. Oh, fuck.
Don't want to lose that now, do I?
Again, it's an honor.
[Archbishop] …of our stewardship of this great…
[Swagger] That our guy in the collar? [Johnson] The Archbishop of Ethiopia.
He's getting a medal. Know it?
HOA. Horn of Africa. Yeah.
You know I worked there?
You know what they say about the first thing that you feel
when you shoot a civilian?
-Recoil of your rifle? -Right.
[Swagger] That's very original.
[announcer] Thank you, Archbishop, for those inspiring words.
[Johnson] The President speaks next.
All teams stand by.
[man on radio] Agent Gibson, we read your fly-by. Situation all clear, over.
[man 2] Agent James, all clear.
[announcer] Now it gives me enormous pleasure…
-Got wind at three, full value. -…to introduce to you
the President of the United States.
Make it four-and-a-half minutes of angle.
Three-mil hold, in case the wind dies.
He's loaded.
Altitude, humidity, temperature accounted for.
[president] In the city that was the capital of… [Swagger] We gotta take him.
Ten seconds.
Wind matches his setup. Take him! Take him now!
Send in the ERT team. Take out the…
[man] Shots fired! Shots fired!
[man on radio] Flashlight is down, Flashlight is down.
-What? Flashlight down? -I say again, Flashlight is down.
[newscaster 1] The President has been shot. [newscaster 2] There's mass confusion…
Has the President been shot?
[man] Right at the church steeple.
[Payne] How could you miss?
How could you fucking miss?
Thirty seconds, clear out. Chase him down.
He's bleeding. Kill him.
[man 1] Command Post to Condor Two, load up, over.
[man 2] Condor Two loading up.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Hurry up, guys. Come on.
[man] Condor Two, this is Command Post. Stand by for update, over.
[man 2] Standing by, over.
Command Post!
Command Post! Command Post, this is Post 19.
You guys read me?
-Should I hold post? -Please.
Please help me. Please. They shot me.
FBI. Put your hands up! Please. Hey.
Save me.
What?
Give me the keys.
I didn't shoot the President. Timmons was a setup.
-[car alarm beeping] -Help!
FBI! Took my weapon and my car.
Don't worry, I already shot him twice. You all right?
[man 1] CP, 17, can you repeat possible suspect description?
[woman 1] Negative, no further at this time.
[woman 2] CP, this is 15. No activity at my location.
I am available to move if necessary.
[woman 1] Copy that.
[Timmons on radio] This is Officer Timmons requesting backup.
Pursuing suspect in assassination.
Now fleeing in stolen FBI vehicle, moving south on Front from Diamond.
Suspect is armed and dangerous. I repeat,
suspect is armed and dangerous.
[woman 1] All Philly PD units be advised,
assassination suspect is fleeing in a stolen FBI vehicle.
He is going south on Front from Diamond.
[man 2] This is Condor 2. We are transitioning from roadhouse to Front Street.
Please advise for further description of suspect vehicle.
[woman 1] Dispatch, 419, I'm heading south on Thompson.
Do we have a color, anything on the vehicle?
[woman 1] Assassination suspects vehicle
is one government-issue black 2006 Ford Crown Vic. Pennsylvania license number 7-3-1-7
Pennsylvania license number 7-3-1-7 James David Edward, over.
[man] What was suspect's last known location? Over.
[woman 1] Last known is south on Front.
Do we have multiple suspects or a single suspect?
[woman 1] Agent James, negative. No further information…
[man 1] This is Agent Pittman. Car seen going high speed on Castor.
High speed on Castor. Be advised.
Timmons called it in?
Right on time, like he was supposed to.
-Before he shot him again. -Well, he's been hit twice,
so unless he can stop the bleeding without going to the hospital or a doctor,
it doesn't really matter.
They're going to find him lying dead by a dumpster in an alley in 20 minutes.
[man 1] What is your location?
[man 1] Suspect vehicle a black sedan, four-door…
[woman 1] All units be advised,
eyewitness reports suspect vehicle entering High-Tech Car Wash
on the northwest corner of Girard and 9th, over.
[man 2] Command Post be advised,
this is Condor Two en route to suspect location, over.
[man 3] Command Post, Condor Three copies. All en route.
-Yo, man! -Watch it, man!
Shit!
[man 2] Command Post, Condors Two and Three moving to intercept, over.2
[officer 1] Suspect vehicle collided with a truck under the 95.
He's at Market and Columbus.
[officer 1] Looks good. Vehicle is disabled. Repeat, vehicle disabled.
[officer] Take him down! Fire!
I got a Crown Vic. Black. Government plates.
Dead guy in the front seat?
I want the banks of this river lined for 30 miles, five minutes ago.
All right. Let's start the search downriver.
[reporter] I'm here with Officer Timmons, who pursued the suspect on foot.
Officer, can you tell us what happened?
[newscaster 1] The would-be assassin, tentatively identified
as retired Marine Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger,
is being pursued by thousands of State and Federal law enforcement personnel
as we speak.
[newscaster 2] As the net begins to tighten nationwide, there is still no trace of Swagger.
Nothing but an abandoned car has been found
at the bottom of the Delaware River.
[newscaster 3] Seven-year veteran Philadelphia police officer Stanley Timmons,
first to respond to the scene,
is believed to have shot and injured Swagger.
Early reports indicate that the assailant
may have been hit as many as two times.
Meanwhile, the FBI has been unwilling to comment
on information that an agent of theirs
was assaulted and disarmed by Swagger as he fled the scene,
possibly in a stolen FBI vehicle.
At this time, no sign of Swagger has been found.
You have embarrassed this office.
You will be facing a review from the Office of Professional Responsibility.
Sir…
Well, I don't feel embarrassed.
A Force Recon Marine Scout Sniper
disarmed me three weeks out of the academy.
If anything, I feel lucky to be alive.
Why'd he say he didn't shoot the President?
Because he didn't.
Also, he said Timmons was a setup.
He never said that.
City cop managed to spot, shoot this guy twice.
You got your ass kicked.
You're misremembering.
That's normal under extreme stress events.
Have you given your official statement yet?
Because I would be very cautious about what went in it.
Well, maybe I should wait for the report to come out, read it and then remember.
[man whispering] Can you believe this fucking guy?
There you go.
Yes? The raw feeds are in from the networks.
[newscaster 1] …development, security camera footage from Washington, D.C.
and several locations in Philadelphia
shows the suspect, Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger,
scouting shooting locations, traveling and taking wind readings.
As the net begins to tighten nationwide, there is still no trace of Swagger.
Excuse me.
Can't sell you nothing. Just lost our power.
Please. I got cash, and you can keep the change.
Ain't gonna be able to find nothing.
Please, all I need is a marinade needle, some salt, some sugar,
couple bottles of water.
How many?
[Memphis] Well, sir, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sure she's a really nice Christian woman,
but we don't take care of those things here.
Yeah. Okay, well… [newscaster] The FBI released a video letter threatening the life of the President.
[newscaster] The FBI released a video letter threatening the life of the President. …see a counselor. Dr. Phil or something. Okay.
…signed and dated by Bob Lee Swagger just 10 days ago.
[newscaster 2] Federal agents today executed a search warrant
in the Wind River range of Wyoming
where Swagger had been living for several years.
In the meantime, the FBI has been unwilling to comment,
as no sign of Swagger has been found.
-Get anything? -No.
Yeah, wait, wait. Where was this?
[Turner] And? Yes?
She thinks it was him, but it was dark because the power was out in the store.
-What'd he buy? -[man] Gotta be.
Uh, salt, sugar, water, and a marinade injector.
Guy going to a barbecue.
Salt, water, an injector could be used for an IV,
but what's with the sugar?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold that! Hold that!
Well, sugar's been used to treat battlefield wounds for hundreds of years.
It has something to do with osmotic pressure. It was popular during the Napoleonic War.
It was popular during the Napoleonic War.
Uh-huh. You go into Howard's office with the Napoleonic War,
he's gonna put you on psych leave.
Go back to your desk. I'm saving your life.
-[gunshot] -One thing is…
…1790 to 1800.
-One thing is… -[gunshot]
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.
I know who you are.
You're Bob Lee. Swagger. Donnie's old partner.
Look, I didn't shoot the President.
I know.
You do?
The President's not dead. Ethiopian Archbishop is.
Why in the hell would somebody want to shoot him?
Look, you're a nurse, right?
No. No, that was Donnie's dream. I couldn't stand the blood.
I teach the third grade.
-Please. -Look, you should go.
Please.
Please?
I didn't do whatever they said I did.
I swear.
I'm in some bad trouble and I need some help.
I wouldn't have come all the way here to lie to you.
You still figuring on shooting me?
Only that shotgun's a little long to bring up fast.
Look, if you're going to do it, just get it over with.
I ain't got nowhere else to go.
Pull the truck in the garage. The neighbors will be up in a minute.
You'd best call me Sarah.
All right.
[woman] 911, what's your emergency?
Hello?
[woman] This is 911. We received a hang-up from this location.
Yeah, neighbor's dog knocked over the trash cans
and scared the hell out of me. Everything's fine. Thanks.
Okay, then.
Seems you call the police and hang up without saying anything,
they call you back right away.
I should've come and seen you in person.
Before. I mean, then.
Yeah, I read the letter.
It was okay.
And once a year I got the flowers.
You don't look real good.
I'm supposed to be dead. Been a long night.
Why aren't you?
Well, the U.S. government spent a lot of time and money
teaching me how not to die
after they got done teaching me how to kill people.
So how is it I'm supposed to help you?
You can do a running cross-stitch, finish it with an embroidery knot?
Yeah.
You got to try to spread it out.
It's gonna look odd you buy it all in one place.
How can it be three years ago when it seems like ten?
Mileage can be rough.
No one ever beats me in.
You never left.
Everyone keeps telling me I'm crazy.
Like I didn't see what I saw, or heard what I heard.
I'm not crazy, though. You think I'm crazy?
Where did all this stuff come from?
At first I thought it was Washington, Quantico.
I checked and it didn't. It just magically arrived.
Cooperating agencies, ATF, NRO, places that don't even have initials
they cooperate in times of national emergency.
You need to get some sleep.
You know that the first ballistics diagram got here
22 minutes after the shooting.
We're good at our jobs.
12 minutes after the shooting, they were still scrambling choppers.
The scene was locked down.
How did they get a reverse azimuth ten minutes after that?
I mean, we work for the federal government.
We're not that good at our jobs.
[Memphis] You want to see something? [woman] Probably not.
[Memphis] I downloaded this.
This is a full-scale printout
of a target Swagger shot two years ago at 1,000 yards.
I punched in the holes myself. It was at a competition.
I read an article. It said Swagger shot a silver dollar at a grand.
Five shots,
at 1,000 yards,
an inch-and-a-half spread. An inch and a half!
It was the capital of the United States…
That's the flag behind the President. It's barely waving.
This is the wind speed and direction according to the National Weather Service
at the time of the shot. I did the math.
Now, how does a man who can do that
miss by two-and-a-half feet at 2,000 yards?
I don't get it.
[woman] You had a long night. Let it go and get some sleep.
You know, I saw Timmons interviewed.
He said he was walking foot patrol,
saw a rifle barrel sticking out of a window,
went upstairs to investigate, and shot Swagger.
No sniper sticks his rifle out of a window.
They shoot from cover, back in the room.
It doesn't make any sense.
-I'm gonna talk to Timmons. -No, you're not.
Why? 'Cause they're gonna fire me if I do?
Timmons was killed by a mugger in an alley last night.
In a conspiracy, all loose ends are trimmed.
Jack Ruby shoots Oswald?
Bad things happen to good people.
Yeah, not that quick, they don't.
Well, I stopped the bleeding temporarily.
But it'll cut loose again.
I held off the worst of the infection, but you're gonna have to open it up,
cut out and scrub away anything that's dead,
working your way out, sewing it together
and you got to try to make sure you don't re-infect it.
You ready for this?
I'm going to do all those Whip-it's and pass out.
Good luck, okay?
[Johnson] I need you to plan a presidential assassination.
[Swagger] That our guy in the collar?
Whose president?
[Johnson] I didn't say "execute".
He's getting a medal. Know it? The Archbishop of Ethiopia.
The Archbishop of Ethiopia.
[Swagger] You need to find the shooter.
No.
Two-and-a-half days, shot twice, no sign?
Find me something.
Maybe he crawled into a hole and died.
He's not dead.
Tear apart his life.
Again.
Go okay?
I've been hallucinating.
Something I need to tell you.
Ralphie's dead.
Who's Ralphie?
Well, they said you shot your dog
'cause you knew you weren't coming back.
They said that, huh?
Name was Sam.
He was a good dog. I raised him from a pup.
You okay?
No.
What are you gonna do?
I'll get better.
Then I'm going to burn their playhouse down.
Can I help you?
Hold still.
I been meaning to ask you.
You have a boyfriend?
Why?
Am I still supposed to be the grieving widow?
It's been three years.
No.
Just wonder if I'm gonna have to shoot somebody
walks through that door without knocking,
wondering where you've been.
Well, no.
Nothing steady. No boyfriend.
Not bad.
A little stiff, but…
Hey.
You know, you would've made one hell of a nurse.
That was really brave, what you did.
You saved my life.
I'm better. I better get to it.
They're never gonna stop chasing you.
Never.
They're never gonna stop looking.
In the meantime, they need someone else to find.
I'm going to give them him.
Excuse me?
May be a way to get two birds with that stone, too.
-Swagger? -Hey.
The gun Donnie learned to hunt with when he was a kid.
It ain't much, but it shoots true.
I cleaned and oiled it before I put it away.
You sure?
Yeah.
Why'd you go?
When they came to see you.
They know which buttons to press.
I'm still enough of a sucker, you press that patriot button,
I'll sit up in my chair and say, "Which way you want me to go, boss?"
I mean, I ain't real proud of it, but I ain't ashamed, either.
You know, I got a plan,
but I think I'm going to need your help.
Okay. I'll do it.
I haven't even told you what it is yet.
I know.
Look.
It was my fault.
What?
You know, with Donnie. I should never have…
What?
Don't you dare.
Don't you try and take that away from him.
He knew exactly what he was doing when he enlisted.
He knew exactly what he was doing
when he enrolled in scout sniper training.
He loved what he did.
No one made him do it.
That ain't yours to carry.
You're right.
I'm sorry I tried.
It's okay.
[Swagger] I need you to meet with this FBI agent.
Use him to flush Johnson out of his hiding place.
Give him the vehicle ID number. He'll do what he's trained to do.
You get in and get out. Don't get caught.
You get caught, I get caught.
[Sarah] You know what that is?
Says he didn't shoot no one, but I don't know.
Well, he's been staying with me.
Who's been staying with you? Bob Lee Swagger?
The plates are probably fake. Pretty sure the other number's real.
-And what is this? -A VIN number.
Seems no one goes through the trouble to change 'em anymore.
And you're going to sit real still until I'm long gone.
See the guy in the Eagles jacket?
[officer] Excuse me, sir. Can I see some ID, please?
Sir, I'm going to need you to take off your hat
and show me some ID.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Take your hat off, asshole!
Get on the ground! Get your ass on the ground!
[man] Hey, how's it going?
Hey, John.
-[man] Hey, Ed? -[Ed] Yeah.
[man] You got that Stevens file we wanted back?
How badly do you want to know? Because this will get you fired.
Well, I have to go before the Office of Professional Responsibility
in 45 minutes for a review.
I'm gonna get fired anyway. I'm done worrying about that.
What do you think?
I think that CNN got the tapes before we did,
already edited together to show the angles.
Who delivered them?
An unnamed agency who will never confirm or deny.
They denied, which is a…
Which is a confirmation of sorts.
Of what?
That you are asking questions way outside your pay grade.
Oh, come on, just tell me.
You don't want to be here for that review.
They don't have to stop at firing you. They can charge you and hold you.
The ASAC's job comes with Delta clearance.
-Thank you. -Go.
[Dobbler] This is a copy of a chat-room transcript.
These guys talk about everything. I didn't give it much thought at the time.
We just traced it to a donut shop with free Wi-Fi.
But this, this is a Delta-level clearance request
out of the FBI field office in Philadelphia seven minutes ago.
Funny thing, Google Maps puts the donut shop
only three blocks away from the field office.
There's only one guy who met with Swagger before he disappeared.
He lives in Philly.
And he works for the FBI.
Nicholas Memphis.
[Galindo] …really strange company. Contracts with a lot of the Fortune 500.
Offices in Virginia, Delaware, registered in Panama.
They own a boat that's flagged out of Libya.
They're definitely not government,
but they have high ex-military contacts like you wouldn't believe.
These are contractors.
I can't tell what this company does, but…
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
Memphis?
Memphis!
For a man who didn't know much,
you sure took a long, painful time to tell it.
Get him some water.
Good.
Got to pee yet?
Got to flush them drugs out of your system.
Look awful suspicious if you were to go and shoot yourself
pumped full of the same shit the agency uses.
I'm not going to shoot myself.
Sure you will.
Take him out. Get him ready.
No!
That's my gun.
Yeah.
You wrote a real touching suicide note, too.
All overwrought with guilt about your mistakes.
Quit your struggling.
This thing works. It's not the first time we've used it.
Russo. Russo!
Davis, get out here!
What is the goddamn hold-up?
Don't kill me, please! Don't kill me! I believe you!
Kill you?
Had enough chances. I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.
What kind of asshole'd think up a thing like this?
Not bad with a poodle shooter and a makeshift silencer, huh?
Help me toss these boys in the water?
You set me up and you used me as bait!
You think? Flushed them out, didn't it? I was kind of hoping to keep one alive,
but they were kind of determined to kill you.
You can hire a good lawyer, and I'll call the Bureau.
They can work out some kind of deal.
This is explainable. You can prove that you didn't shoot the Archbishop.
I don't think you understand.
These boys killed my dog.
Hey, this is the 21st century. You can't go to war with these people.
In the end, the law is all…
In the end, the law'll never catch and hold them.
In a year or two, they'll be back in business.
New names, new messenger boys, same old story.
And I'll be dead.
It's gonna be some hard, hairy work, Pork.
There's gonna be more shooting, and more people are gonna die.
Now, I didn't start it, but be sure as hell I mean to see it through.
So you get it straight. You in or you out?
You know, I missed a meeting today
where I was going to get fired for unprofessional conduct
because I was kidnapped by people that don't exist.
I'll take his legs.
It's a good call, Pork.
You're trying to tell me a rookie FBI agent
overpowered and killed the three of them?
No.
They were shot from a distance of about 200 yards.
With a .22.
-Swagger's alive. -Yes.
And that young kid,
FBI Agent
Nick Memphis,
who managed to pry out a Delta-level clearance,
hasn't come back to the office and is out there with him.
What?
I just went over Swagger's financials again.
Once a year, he sent flowers to someone with his Visa card.
I cracked the FTD database, got an address.
Donnie Fenn's widow. Anniversary of his death.
She went back to using her maiden name,
which is why we missed it the first time.
She's maybe the only person in the entire world
that would believe anything that Swagger had to say.
Look. Keene City, Kentucky.
It's just within driving range.
What are you waiting for? Take the jet. All right.
We've given Swagger a new war,
he's found a new spotter.
This is about to get worse.
I think we're here.
Hey. Swagger.
I think we're here.
Welcome to Tennessee.
Patron state of shooting stuff.
Hey, who is this guy?
This guy was the greatest gunsmith east of the Mississippi. He's a legend.
He knows more about guns and the people who shoot them
than Smith & Wesson.
Don't really matter anymore. He knew we were coming the last three miles.
-You mind your manners. -All right.
You boys come a long way. What you looking for?
Wisdom.
You come to the wrong place.
Maybe.
Say a man wanted to fire a bullet from one rifle
and have it match exactly to another. Could that be done?
Take a seat.
Have a chair, son.
If you could get a bullet that had been shot clean through the first rifle,
could make the grooves match.
Kind of thing ain't been done in a long time, though.
The bullet that was taken out of the Archbishop
was completely mangled on impact.
FBI match was metallurgical.
Thank you, Mother.
Yeah, but you couldn't guarantee that going in, so they had to be sure.
And I still can't figure out how they could be.
Good coffee? Yep.
Look on your left, there. Second shelf down.
Red leather spine.
Written by a guy named Schofeld.
Put it there 15 years ago. Don't figure it's moved since then.
Yeah. Paper patching.
State of the art. 1870s Africa.
Paper-wrapped bullet.
No metal on metal going down the barrel.
Grooves would match. Paper unwinds at the muzzle.
Leaves no traces when it hits.
Interesting question, though. Hope I satisfied you.
I got another one.
I thought you might.
Suppose I was looking for a man to make a 2,200-yard cold-bore shot.
Who's alive that could do that?
Seems I heard about a shot like that being made not too long ago.
Said the guy's name was Bob Lee Swagger.
Never met the man, so I wouldn't know him.
Yeah, they said that, all right.
They also said that artificial sweeteners were safe,
and WMDs were in Iraq,
and Anna Nicole married for love!
Would've been a bad job to take, though.
How come?
Whoever took that shot's probably dead now.
That's how a conspiracy works.
Them boys on the grassy knoll, they were dead within three hours.
Buried in the damn desert. Unmarked graves out past Terlingua.
And you know this for a fact?
Still got the shovel.
Sake of argument, somebody other than him?
There was a guy in Russia.
They locked his ass up.
Another one in France. I know he's dead.
There was one guy,
but he don't shoot no more.
A brutal son of a bitch.
Most boys shoot to kill. He'd shoot to wound,
wait till his friends come to help,
kill them too.
Turned one target into four.
Men, women, children. Killed them by the hundreds.
The other side wanted him. Bad.
Finally narrowed his hide down to an abandoned six-story building.
They quit the subtle tactics.
They called in an artillery strike.
Leveled a square block.
Brought the building down on his ass.
Some say he crawled out of there.
Some say he died.
Never heard from him no more.
Fuck me.
What?
I met the son of a bitch.
Yeah. The world ain't what it seems, is it, Gunny?
No, sir.
You keep that in mind.
The moment you think you got it figured,
you're wrong.
He got a name?
Hey, it's me, Nick.
Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?
Yeah. Are you okay? Nick, where are you?
It's better I don't tell you.
Look, do you have a pen?
I need you to find someone. Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.
-Yeah. -You got it?
I got it.
Man, this is hard to spell.
Swagger is going to go with what he knows.
He'll try to track the shooter.
He won't get far that way.
Yes, he will.
How's that? We're going to help him.
Sometimes to catch a wolf, you need to tie the bait to a tree.
And what happens to the bait?
Hard to say.
But that's the nature of being the bait.
Hey, it's Nick. Did you find him? He's in Virginia.
[Johnson] An end we thought was tied up
came untied.
Meaning, Colonel?
Swagger is still alive.
Oh, my.
I need to land a transport plane without a customs check.
I'm certain I don't want to know, but what's on the plane?
Crew we used in Ethiopia.
Twenty-four good, hard men.
Weapons and gear.
Only 24?
Do kill him.
No loose ends this time.
Night, Colonel.
Good night, Senator.
Hello?
Someone there?
Now look.
Look what you've done now.
Give me that.
I don't want you to hurt yourself. Okay?
Where's your boyfriend?
[Memphis] What if it's a trap?
[Swagger] Oh, it's a trap.
Guaranteed. Every time.
Question is, for whom?
-You got your list, right? -Yeah.
All right, you make sure you stick to it.
Let's go.
Okay, so what are these for again?
Tear gas is going to be on my remote.
Right.
Napalm on the first floor. Pipe bombs on the rest of them.
Gotta be very careful with these. It's got a 15-foot kill radius.
So what exactly are we getting ready for?
For as much as we can be.
All right, you got four enemy combatants.
Take them one by one.
Keep shooting. Don't let anything distract you.
Fuck!
Didn't I say don't let anything distract you?
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Let's see it.
No. No.
It's just you and me, baby.
No!
[Memphis] You got three guards.
One at your two o'clock,
twelve o'clock
and ten o'clock.
Danger close. Two o'clock, fifty yards.
[Memphis] You got one right on you.
Twenty yards and closing.
[Sandor] Go check the perimeter.
And tell the others to stay alert.
[guard] I'm on it. Right away, sir.
Swagger, you got one above you on the roof.
You killed all three?
There were four.
I want Johnson's real name. I want to know who he works for.
I want to know why it was worth going through that much effort
to kill the Archbishop.
Aren't you the one that shot him?
And if I don't know any of those things?
Then you're of no worth to me
and I might as well shoot you now and leave.
Johnson's had a lot of names.
Don't know one's any more real than the next.
Knowing would only be dangerous.
He's ex-army.
Pretty sure he was a full-bird colonel.
Go on.
They came for me, like they came for you.
Recruitment for a single job.
They like the wounded.
Easier to use
and then throw away when you are done.
Timmons, you, me…
Once you've been a wolf, it's hard to be staked down like a goat.
This is just one dead man talking to another.
And the Archbishop?
You want to take all suspicions away when you shoot someone,
wait till he's standing next to the President.
What was he going to say?
The truth.
That nothing, no matter how horrible,
ever really happens without the approval of the government.
Over there, and here.
The problem isn't the doing.
It's the people in power having to admit
that they knew.
The prisoners are tortured at Abu Ghraib,
and only the underlings go to jail.
Their bosses knew.
We know their bosses knew.
But you don't say it.
What exactly happened in Africa?
Somehow the villagers didn't think
that an oil pipeline
was a good enough reason to move their village
to a place where the spirit gods didn't exist.
Drink?
So they asked them all nicely to move and when they didn't, they just killed them all?
No.
They didn't ask.
They just killed them.
All.
So the next village won't need to be asked.
They'll just go.
There is a mass grave with 400 bodies,
men, women, children,
under the oil-pumping station ten kilometers over the Eritrean border.
You should know.
You covered the retreat of the contractors who did the job.
Of course, you weren't supposed to survive that, either.
Who runs Johnson?
A senator. From Montana, I think.
You don't get it.
There is no head to cut off.
It's a conglomerate.
If one of them betrays the principles
of the accrual of money and power,
the others betray him.
What it is
is human weakness.
You can't kill that with a gun.
[whispering] Swagger.
Swagger.
You got to get out of there. They're everywhere.
Had to keep you till they got here.
Lying wasn't going to hold you.
You would have known.
By the way, they've got your woman.
[Memphis] Swagger.
They're 20 yards and closing. You got to get out of there.
Bug out. Go to hide two. [Memphis] Roger that.
[panting] Swagger, I'm in position two.
You got to get out of there.
-They're all over the place. -Hey!
Calm down.
Blow the pipe bombs outside on my call, okay? You got it?
[whispering] Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got it.
Listen very carefully. On my one, you blow the pipe bombs,
then the gas.
Three, two, one…
Hit it. Hit the napalm.
Swagger!
You got it.
[Memphis] Swagger!
Swagger!
Swagger!
You got to bug out on my go behind that barn.
Okay.
-You ready? -Yeah.
Go!
Come on!
You got to gun it to that tree line.
What?
You got five shots left. Gotta draw that bird out.
Okay. Okay.
On my cover, all right? Okay.
All right, go!
[man] Pull up! Pull up!
Time to go!
[woman] Let me take a look.
[Purnell] Not right now.
Morning, beautiful.
See this shootout in Virginia?
Shells everywhere, helicopter remnants, blood. No bodies, though, right?
And they get fingerprints off the cartridge cases.
First set positively ID'd as Bob Lee Swagger.
Second set belongs to Special Agent Nick Memphis
of the FBI.
What? That's gotta be wrong.
Now, the only reasonable question to ask after that is, uh,
what the fuck is going on?
Great shot!
-[man] All yours, Dan! -[man 1] Good shooting!
I'm beginning to think that you were the wrong man for the job.
Think what you want.
It appears we misjudged the gunnery sergeant.
There's always a confused soul
that thinks that one man can make a difference.
And you have to kill him to convince him otherwise.
That's the hassle with democracy.
[man] Pull!
[Purnell] …fire under their asses, you understand me?
We need those results now.
Anna, you guys, you take the team… Anna! To the roadhouse.
Okay, I don't care who it is right now. I don't give…
Guys! We got Memphis on the line.
Start a trace.
Got it. I'm on it.
Nick. Hey, it's Howard here. How are you?
Things have gotten a little complicated. I got Bob Lee Swagger in custody.
Yeah, turns out he's not dead, Howard.
Yeah, I know. Word of that possibility had begun to reach us.
Got him.
Were you in a gunfight in Virginia last night?
Like I said, things have gotten a little complicated.
Well, obviously the best thing for you would be to bring him in, right?
I know, I can't do that.
Why?
It's gotten too deep. It's not clear who can be trusted.
But we're the FBI, son. Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I'll keep in touch.
Oh, Nick, wait…
Son of a bitch.
-Did we get that? -Got him.
-Let's move. -They're on an interstate
-outside Bozeman, Montana. -Let's move!
This is Swagger.
Colonel Johnson here. Figured you'd be listening.
It appears you have nowhere to go. [Swagger] Colonel?
If it is "Colonel"?
It is.
I have something you want. Well, it seems so do I.
[beeps] [Sandor] Over the Eritrean border, there is a mass grave with 400 bodies.
Men, women, children.
Tell you what, I'll give it to you and we'll call it even.
I just want someone there I can trust.
I'm amenable. Who do you have in mind?
How about that guy from U2 with the glasses?
Friend of Nelson Mandela and all. He seems trustworthy.
Bono? You want them to get Bono?
My colleague's questioning my choice. Okay,
I see how that could be a tough problem. You know, last minute and all.
How about six-term senator Charles Meachum
from Montana?
Seems like a pretty good second choice, don't you think?
I don't think so.
I'm gonna provide you with two numbers, then we'll talk.
Point 732. Point 648.
And what the hell is that?
Those are the last three digits, down to a few meters of latitude and longitude,
of an oil pipeline pumping station in Eritrea
with 400 bodies underneath.
Where are we meeting?
Somewhere I can see you,
coming from a goddamn long way off.
Where's your boy?
Well, I'm here.
He's here.
Look, look, look.
There's your boy. There's your boy, baby.
Come on, come on. Look, look. Look up.
Okay.
I think I broke a rib!
Don't move!
Is there anybody else?
No.
He head-shoots me, spasm kills her!
You got no shot!
No shot, Swagger! You hear that, Swagger?
You got no shot!
What are you gonna do? Come on!
[Payne] It's over for you, buddy!
No shot! Okay, fuck him.
Not bad!
Pretty good! He went for the shot.
Christ.
[Turner] How can we help you?
Guest at the motel last night gave me $100
to bring this by here at 3:00 p.m.
Let's move!
You all right?
Yeah.
Search him.
[Meachum] I don't carry a weapon,
ordinarily.
[Meachum] I'm licensed to carry that in this state.
Pull the pilot.
[Memphis] Put your weapon down! Put it down!
Put your gun down!
Easy. Easy.
Sarah.
Give me the gun.
It's okay. Give me the gun.
You okay?
[Memphis] Put them up. Keep them up.
Nice shooting, Gunny.
Yeah, you got what you came for.
I think it's time you owe us your side of the bargain.
You do, huh?
Yes, I do, son. I certainly do.
Why don't we think about all this that has gone on
just as a preamble?
You got any plans after this?
You have a rather unique skill set. I'd be interested in offering you a job.
Work? For you?
It's not really as bad as it seems. It's all gonna be done in any case.
You might as well be on the side that gets you well-paid for your efforts.
And what side are you on?
There are no sides. There's no Sunnis and Shiites.
There's no Democrats and Republicans. There's only haves and have-nots.
What exactly does working for you entail, Senator, huh?
Raping and murdering innocent women and children, you sick fuck?
You sanctioned the mass murder of an entire village
so a pipeline could go through.
One village!
And it brought stability to the region.
Which means that no one chops off their arms
because their grandmother's grandfather
belonged to a different tribe.
They like us down there, boy.
This is a country
where the Secretary of Defense
can go on TV
and tell the American public,
oh, that, "This is about freedom! It's not about oil!"
And nobody questions him,
because they don't want to hear the answer because it's a lie!
There's only so many places at the table, Gunny.
Now are you on the inside, or are you on the out?
It's the FBI!
It's gonna be okay. Hold this.
[Sandor] If one of them betrays the principles of the accrual…
I don't think so, Senator.
What are you doing? Saving our lives.
That proved you were innocent! Nobody out here is innocent!
This stuff's plutonium. Nobody can handle it without dying.
You hand it over to the authorities, it's just gonna disappear, along with us!
Unless you want to get buried in the hills outside Terlingua.
I'm out, old man!
I'm just a peckerwood who lives in the hills with too many guns.
You happy?
Where do you think you're going?
Washington!
You going to shoot a sitting U.S. senator in the back?
Lord knows I want to.
I didn't think so.
[Swagger] Let him go.
They've got your rifle.
From the beginning, they've always had your rifle.
Recovered at the site.
You can talk as much as you want, but in the end,
you're going to die by lethal injection,
and I'm going to go back to what I was doing.
I won.
You lost.
Get used to the idea, son.
I'm not your son.
[agent 1] Drop your weapons! Put it down now! [agent 2] Don't move!
Special Agent Nick Memphis, FBI! Don't shoot!
-[agent 2] On the ground! -[agent 1] Down, now!
I said get down!
Could I free my hands, please? It's okay.
Thank you, sir.
-Thanks for bringing her. -Mmm-hmm.
Hey. I'm sorry about everything.
It's not your fault. It is what it is.
This is Attorney General Russert.
Director Brandt. Sir.
Senator Meachum couldn't be with us today.
I'm sure we can manage without him.
Sergeant Swagger, you asked for this meeting.
Against my better judgment, I've agreed to it as a favor to the FBI.
What the hell am I doing here?
You've got nothing on me. I'm covered.
Call the Joint Chief.
That won't be necessary, Colonel,
as I have already received no less than a dozen calls
from highly-ranked and powerfully-placed individuals
telling me to let you go.
But the joy of checks and balances in our government is that I can,
and am, indeed, required by law,
to tell them to fuck off.
This is about evidence and finding out the truth,
so you sit there and be quiet.
Sergeant, you've got five minutes.
Thank you.
This is my weapon.
No question about it, don't deny it.
You recovered it at the scene moments after the assassination.
We agree?
It's been in the FBI's possession ever since,
hasn't been tampered with in any way?
No. Absolutely not.
You fire the weapon? There was no point.
The slug was mangled beyond recognition.
It was, however, an exact metallurgical match.
Right. Definitely my bullets.
Definitely my gun.
Special Agent Memphis, you believe I shot that Archbishop?
Nope. No, I don't.
Have any proof of this fact? No.
-Trust me? -Yep.
Really trust me?
Yeah.
With your life?
Yep. Good.
What the hell are you doing? Put that weapon down now!
If you're zeroed for 600, you ought to aim a little lower.
Ain't gonna make a difference this close.
Only thing that's gonna make a difference is whether I'm crazy or not.
I could keep doing this all day,
with every weapon in my house.
I swapped all the firing pins before I left the house. I always do.
Looks right, need a micrometer to tell.
But the gun don't shoot.
That bullet you got out of that bishop was fired from my weapon,
but a week before, at a can of stew.
I did take an oath to defend this country from all enemies, foreign and domestic.
I just didn't figure I'd end up quite this involved.
But at the end of the day, when all the dust settles,
you can't hide from the truth, you son of a bitch.
Whatever.
Who gives a shit?
Nice presentation.
But none of it sticks to me.
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.
Done.
I'll be seeing you.
He's right. There's nothing to prove he did anything.
Yeah, in this country.
Sir, you should take a look at these.
These images are from a classified file showing a village of people in Africa
that were exterminated by the colonel and his associates.
[Russert] My God.
Look around you.
This isn't the Horn of Africa.
That's all hearsay.
This is the land of the free and the home of the brave.
And I'm free to go.
[Russert] Colonel, your moral compass is so fucked up,
I'll be shocked if you manage to find your way back to the parking lot.
Regardless of how I feel about this,
these events occurred in another country,
outside of our laws.
So that's it? That's the best you can do?
This isn't the World Court, Sergeant.
And I don't have the jurisdiction to detain the colonel
for crimes he may or may not have committed on another continent.
Sir, I urge you to reconsider-- There's nothing to reconsider, son.
I win.
You lose.
Again.
This is ridiculous.
For the record, I don't like the way this turned out any more than you do.
But this is the world we live in.
And justice does not always prevail.
It's not the Wild West,
where you can clean up the streets with a gun.
Even though sometimes that's exactly what's needed.
Bob Lee Swagger, you're free to go.
Unshackle the sergeant.
[Johnson] I'd say that's quite a shot, Senator.
[Meachum] In the face.
You heard that expression, "You didn't know whether to shit or go blind"?
"You didn't know whether to shit or go blind"?
You should've seen the look on the Attorney General's face.
Did he give his checks-and-balances speech?
"This is about evidence and the truth!"
And then you just said to him,
"Fuck you!"
"Hold my cigar, Mr. A.G."
"Fuck you!
"The truth is what I say it is!"
You know, you got to be out of the country in the morning.
You're going to Ecuador.
Well, we're having some problems with the locals.
We have our personnel on the ground ready to neutralize the problem, but…
Well, they've requested you.
It's solvable.
They requested you--
Swagger.
Turn off the lights!
Get my car.
Get my car.
[whispers] Do something.
Do something!
Where is he?
He's under the floor! [gunshot]
You don't need to kill me.
You don't need to kill me. It was them.
It was them.
God damn it! Just wait a minute!
Hold it just a minute. Hold it.
Are you out of your mind? Are you out of your damn mind?
four brothers…
genetically reborn  in the sewers of New York.
Named after the great  Renaissance masters…
and trained as ninjas.
They battled  many creatures and foes
before defeating  their arch-enemy,  the Shredder.
But now,  a greater evil is poised  to destroy  their very brotherhood.
An evil born 3,000 years ago.
It was in that time that a warrior king named Yoatl
It was in that time that a warrior king named Yoatl  led a brotherhood that fought side by side with one purpose.
led a brotherhood that fought side by side with one purpose.
To conquer all the kingdoms  of the world.
Nothing could  stand in their way,
as they left a trail of  destruction behind them.
In his quest, the warrior  learned of a constellation
known as the Stars of Kicaan.
Every 3,000 years,  the stars would align…
opening a portal  to a world of unknown power.
He became immortal,  but at a price.
His brotherhood  was turned to stone.
And upon the portal's opening,
13 monsters were released  into our world.
The warrior king was left to eternally walk the Earth…
unable to die or forget his horrible mistake.
And the monsters  that were unleashed
continue to plague mankind  to this very day.
-[woman] Monsters. -[man chuckles]
No.
We appreciate the generous donation
for the continued protection of your village.
After all, the jungle can be a very dangerous place.
-Mama! -[man] Oh, she is dangerous.
There's monsters out there.
[curses in Spanish] Watch where you're going.
There's a log on the road, senor.
Well, if you're not too busy, remove it!
Cortez, andale.
Dios mio.
Who are you? Show yourself.
[driver] The Ghost of the Jungle.
He punishes those who prey upon the weak.
He's coming.
I just remembered I left the stove on. My wife, she hates that!
-Coward. Get back here. -You're on your own, jefe.
Show yourself. Do you realize who you're dealing with?
What is this? What?
I am not afraid of a myth.
I'm not afraid of a ghost.
What are you?
[gasps] It's a miracle.
The Ghost of the Jungle.
There. That's where I saw him.
Thank you.
You'd better get home now.
Do you know the ghost?
He wasn't always a ghost.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
[Leonardo] It's a long way from the city to just drop in.
Leo.
You came all the way down here to look for me?
Actually, I was already here on business.
But then the local legend started sounding familiar,
so I decided to snoop around.
What kind of business?
Ancient artifacts.
Some tycoon with too much time on his hands
has his heart set on a collection of 3000-year-old statues.
Well, you always did run with a strange crowd, April.
Yeah, well. Our strange crowd
hasn't been the same without you.
Things aren't looking so good back home.
[sighs] How bad could it be?
Donnie's probably got everything under control.
-Sir? Sir. Sir. -[man chattering]
Did you turn the computer on? Have you plugged it in?
Yeah, that would help.
No, I'm not playing hard to get.
I'm telling you, sir, it's not that kind of phone line.
I'm not your enemy. I'm just Donnie,
your friendly IT tech support, here to help you 24 hours a day, sir.
Yeah, I'm sorry. Ma'am. [chuckles nervously]
But Donnie's a genius.
Why would he take a job like that?
At least he's keeping busy.
Well, if he's doing that, who's keeping an eye on Mikey?
[April] Mike's gotten into the,  um, entertainment business.
Yeah. Happy birthday from Cowabunga Carl.
Take it easy, little dudes. I bruise easily.
Hey, black-and-blue clashes with green, dudes. Hey, that's… [groans]
He's a big hit.
All right. Let's hear it. What's Raph doing?
No one really knows. He just sleeps all day.
Well, what's he do all night?
POLICE[man] 2802, 2802, burglary in progress at 55th and Broadway.
Suspects considered  armed and dangerous.
[Raphael] Time to punch in.
Good work, boys. That was easier than I thought it was gonna be.
Hey, look, guys. I grabbed a toaster.
I love your work ethic, Tommy. It's an inspiration to us all.
-What was that? -Huh?
What's going on, guys?
What in the… Ow!
Looks like it's just you and me, shaky.
Take it easy. I'm not gonna hurt you…
much.
-Boom! -[screaming]
I love when they play hard to get.
The Nightwatcher.
-He's doing our job for us again. -Tommy…
-Keep your hands to yourself. -Hey, who's tickling me?
Your training period ended a year ago.
And Splinter says you don't write anymore.
Splinter sent me down here to become a better leader.
I can't go back a failure.
Besides, these people need me more than my brothers do.
If Master Splinter were here, he would ask you, "What is your heart telling you?"
he would ask you, "What is your heart telling you?"
I don't know. I just know something's missing.
Your brothers need you, Leo.
They're lost without you.
Leo?
Why skate a halfpipe when you can skate a sewer pipe?
Sewer's up, brah.
Ho-ho! Cowabunga!
[distorted] Dude. [normal voice] Going down.
Yeah.
Here's Mikey. -[chuckles nervously] -[video games sounds]
Guys? Anyone?
Hello?
[sighs] Whatever.
This place used to be fun.
[newscaster] And with  rocketing interest rates,
that's bad news for homeowners  as the real-estate market continues its downward spiral.
Coming up, the vigilante known as Nightwatcher strikes again.
[man] Now, I can't say for sure, but he was definitely an alien.
[woman] I think it's a disgrace, taking the law into your own hands like that.
-Leave it to the police. -[newscaster] Up next…
I remember how that used to feel,
busting up crime syndicates.
Sure, they had a bunch of guns,
but they weren't like these guns. [grunts]
Why do you do this to yourself, Mikey?
Those glory days are over.
Forget about 'em. Get on with your life.
Concentrate on your work.
Yeah, yeah. Spoken like a true has-been.
Well, look who woke up.
I suppose you think the Nightwatcher is some kind of hero.
Beats sitting around doing nothing while dirtbags run free.
I would love to know what it is that you do that's so great.
At least we're contributing around here. All you do is sleep all day.
Yeah, I do nothing. You're right.
You got me all figured out.
I know that your attitude has always been
a source of contention to this team. You think fear is the best way to accomplish things, but you're wrong.
You think fear is the best way to accomplish things, but you're wrong.
First of all, this team you speak of doesn't exist anymore.
And second of all… [grunts]
[Splinter] Raphael.
Enough.
[chuckles] I think I made my point.
That doesn't prove anything.
Why couldn't you send him away for training?
Donatello, this home has become like an empty shell.
Each of your brothers has strengths and weaknesses.
You must learn to be strong when they are weak.
If you don't learn to recognize this,
then all hope is lost for our family.
[man] Keep it coming.
[April] Hey, careful.
Those aren't souvenirs.
[man] Ah. Sorry about that, ma'am.
Where are you, Casey?
-[cell phone ringing] -Come on. Come on, pick up.
Don't do this to me again. Not now.
Casey can't come  to the phone right now
'cause we're hardly working.
[groans] This better be good.
[April] Casey,  I am standing on the dock
with a priceless statue  and no delivery truck.
-So my question is, where are you? -April.
Hey, babe. I am so sorry.  I set the alarm clock, but…
It's broken. The clock…
It's bad enough that you're out every night playing vigilante,
but we've got a deadline to meet.
[sighs] I'm sorry.
Oh, wait, babe, real quick.
You left a message saying you found Leo.
-I mean, is he there with you?  -No.
I found him. He's not coming back.
But… But didn't you tell him how weird things have gotten with the Turtles?
Look, Casey, we're gonna lose  the biggest client we have
if you don't get down here.
All right. I'm on my way.
Please tell me we're getting paid by the pound here.
Is this place a museum or what?
You've never heard of WintersCorp?
That's what I'm telling you.
They're into everything, real estate,
technology, pharmaceuticals, hair gel.
-[Casey] I don't wear hair gel. -[April] Really?
[Casey] I'm the caveman type,  au naturel.
Just make sure you don't touch anything in here.
Hey, I was born careful.
-Hope that wasn't expensive. -[alarm blaring]
Oh, wait… Just… I'm…
-Oh, boy. -Please tell me that wasn't you.
-[April] Mr. Winters. -Miss O'Neil.
All the pieces are coming together.
Oh, my. This is my associate, Casey.
-Nice to meet you, Kenny. -Boyfriend. It's Casey.
So you were successful?
Yes. The fourth general.
I want to ask you before I go,
if I could take one last look?
I believe this is the one they call General Akeela?
[Winters] It's actually "Aguila," but that was a good try.
These statues may appear to be only stone,
but they're like family to me.
I didn't choose them.
Friends you can choose, but never your family.
Okay, then.
Take care, Mr. Winters.
If you've come to kill me, could you make it fast?
I've got a shareholders' meeting at 10:00.
I'd rather miss it.
If we had come here to hurt you, you'd be hurting already.
The Foot Clan and I have come to hear your offer.
Well, it appears that today is my lucky day.
I must warn you, we do not come cheap.
Does it look like money is of any concern to me?
Only time is of the essence, my dear.
Since you're so rich and powerful,
what is it we could possibly have to offer you?
I need you to be my eyes and ears.
I have some friends coming to town
that I'd like to roll out the red carpet for.
Greet them warmly and bring them to me.
And how will we know these friends?
[Winters] Don't worry, they're impossible to miss.
And you keep them up. Got that?
And don't let me catch you calling the cops.
[gasps] What? Not again.
Didn't I take care of you last week?
Hey. Oh, no. Come on, now. Wait.
I'm very disappointed in you, knucklehead.
-Guess night school's in session. -[Casey whistles]
Hope I'm not disturbing class.
Hey, Nightwatcher, need any teaching assistants?
[Nightwatcher] [softly] Oh, no. Casey.
[clears throat] I got this one covered, pal. Thanks, but no, thanks.
You think you own these rooftops?
I happen to think you could use my help.
And I could use a sidekick.
You may have everyone else fooled, but you haven't fooled me, Raph.
Yeah, well, guess what, pal. Now you…
Hey, wait a minute. How did you know it was me?
Wasn't that hard, man. You know, you look like a big, metal turtle.
[groans] It's that obvious, huh?
[man panting] I should've stayed in law school.
[Casey] Oh, ain't that cute? He's trying to get away.
[Casey] Well, looks like I got a sidekick.
[Nightwatcher] Yeah, right. You're the sidekick.
[man] What, is it performance art? I don't get it.
[Raphael] What was I supposed to do? Sit around, wait for Leo to come back and save the day?
Sit around, wait for Leo to come back and save the day?
I mean, we haven't heard one word from him
since Splinter sent him away on his little vacation.
Come on, you think these lowlifes take vacations at the first sign of pressure?
No. The criminal element of this city may be guilty of a lot of things
but being quitters ain't one of them.
You know, I don't even care about Leo anymore.
Kind of hope he never comes back.
Come on, aren't you being a little hard on the guy?
I don't know. It's possible.
I guess if I could live anywhere other than the city, I'd go too.
But I could never leave this place.
I can't even sleep without the sound of the subway rumbling over my head.
I guess it comes from growing up with a houseful of brothers.
I'm not trying to tell you what to do.
I'm just saying that if it was my brother, I'd find a way to work it out.
But that's just me.
I got my own issues, you know? Like back at home, with April.
There's this whole thing about settling down
that makes me miss the old times.
I don't know if I can be the grownup she needs me to be.
[sighs] Good talk, Raph.
[Winters] Arise, my brothers. Arise, dear sister.
The Stars of Kicaan align.
All ye generals, wake from your stone slumber.
Dude…
[snoring] Dude.
Enter.
Kneel, my son.
I return from my training, master.
I was so caught up in my own world, I forgot about everyone else.
I'm sorry I failed.
[Splinter] On the contrary, my son…
now you are much stronger.
Your strength is needed here now.
You owe me no apology, but perhaps you should talk to Raphael.
Your absence has been particularly difficult for him…
though he'll never admit it.
I'm certain things will be back to normal in no time, master.
Good. Because until you can act as one,
you are forbidden to fight.
Yes, Sensei.
I have missed you, Leonardo.
I've missed you too, Father.
Raphael… Your brother is home.
-Hey. -Hey.
Welcome home.
Yeah. Thanks.
Well, [yawns] I'm going to bed.
[Raphael] Hey, Leo's back. Better go say hello before he leaves again.
-What? Leo! -Hey. [chuckles]
-Hey. -[Michelangelo] Huh, Leo?
-Is that really you? -Yeah.
-I'm, like, dreaming, aren't I? -No, Mikey, you're not dreaming.
Oh, good. I have nightmares about birthday parties.
[Raphael] Okay, Leo, I'll bite. What are we doing up here?
I told Splinter I'd get this team in shape again.
Hey, I've been training. Since you left, my video-game scores have, like, doubled.
Right, and while you've been playing games, little brother…
this Nightwatcher character's come into the neighborhood
this Nightwatcher character's come into the neighborhood like some kind of vigilante showboat. But his days are done.
like some kind of vigilante showboat. But his days are done.
Hey, you went AWOL, Leo…
and the Nightwatcher was the only guy to pick up the slack.
Crime never took a break. You did.
I heard his bike turns into a plane, or, like, a jetpack.
Hey, Don, you're so smart, why don't we have jetpacks?
Yeah. That's good, Mikey. I don't even trust you with a driver's license.
-Have you seen the way this guy behaves… -[loud roaring]
Oh-ho! Someone's cranky.
-Okay, jungle boy. Grab a vine. -Raph, wait.
-Okay, jungle boy. Grab a vine. -Raph, wait. Splinter told us not to fight.
[Michelangelo chuckling] "Jungle boy." Good one.
[Leonardo] All right. But remember, we're only up here for training.
[Michelangelo] You know what I always say, "Train by doing, dude. "
[Leonardo] Mikey, when have you ever said that?
Oof… You smell that? It's like a monkey cage up here.
Wow, good news is, there's a bunch of Foot ninjas
getting the snot kicked out of them.
Bad news is, this thing is gonna run out of bodies soon.
Yeah, so? You think we should help these guys?
I'd rather enjoy the show. What do you say, fearless leader?
-We're not… -I say we stop talking.
Yahoo!
[Michelangelo] Come here, fuzzy wuzzy.
[Karai] You.
I think we're getting off on the wrong foot here.
-We're trying to help you. -[Karai] Never.
Team… [speaking Japanese]
[Leonardo] Wait, the Shredder's dead.
Who are you working for?
[Raphael] Hey, a little help, O fearless one.
That was too easy.
Like I said, too easy.
Bad dog.
[Donatello grunts] Look at me. Found the elevator.
[Michelangelo] Oh, my shoulder.
[Donatello] My spleen!
[Raphael] This place needed a skylight.
[Michelangelo] This is why we need jetpacks.
-[Donatello] Okay, any more bright ideas? -[Michelangelo] How about this?
[Michelangelo] When this is over, I'm totally calling the architect.
[Donatello] Wait a minute. How did something that big just disappear?
-[sirens wailing] -It doesn't… Uh-oh…
[Michelangelo] Dude, it's the cops.
[Leonardo] Raph. Raph!
I give us a ten for style, an eight for skill,
and a two for stealth.
What seems to be the problem?
The problem is that we were hired to merely patrol the city
and report anything strange to you.
You never said anything about monsters.
Now, I'm sorry that your illustrious group have been reduced to hired guns,
but I believe we made a deal, Karai.
And I expect you to honor it.
You do understand honor, don't you?
So how did we fare?
My, my, my. And what is your name?
Were there any problems, general?
[Aguila] None, my lord.
Then show these fools how a true warrior acts.
Keep them on schedule in completing their task.
[Karai] We do not need any help.
[Winters] Nevertheless, Karai, I trust my family more than I trust you.
You may be the eyes and ears, but they are the muscle.
They will help you gather the remaining twelve of these abominations
so we can finally see our birthrights fulfilled.
[snickers] It's going to be quite a party.
Dudes, did anyone get the license plate of that thing that hit us last night?
Ow, my head.
[Donatello] Okay, that was just weird. I mean, first the Foot,
[Donatello] Okay, that was just weird. I mean, first the Foot, then that hideous monster.
Yeah. It looked like your mom, dude. [laughs]
Yeah, that would make her your mom too, doofus.
Yeah, whatever.
Keep laughing, Mikey. Last night was an embarrassment.
I'll tell you what's embarrassing.
You can't even follow a single order.
Oh, how cute. You've been back for five minutes
and now you're schooling us on your master plan?
Okay, so this is my fault now, huh, Raph?
I'm the only one that has to be responsible?
Hey, you're the trained master, not me.
-Dudes, can it. Here comes Splinter. -[stick tapping]
Oh… Good morning, my sons.
MICHELANGELO, [Donatello] Good morning, Sensei. [Raphael] Sup?
[Splinter] Every ninja's day should start with a healthy breakfast.
It fills me with pride to see you boys together again.
If anyone needs me, I'll be watching my stories.
-[Leonardo] Hothead. -[Raphael] Splinter, Jr.
Cody is going to break up with Donna. I just know it.
[newscaster] We interrupt the Gilmore Girls for this special news report.
Monsters loose in the city?
Strange reports are coming in about a construction site incident
that sounds like something  out of science fiction.
Boys!
[Splinter] Leonardo, I am most disappointed in you.
You are the eldest of your brothers.
I was counting on you to bring order to the chaos of this family.
This is why I have forbidden any surface activity.
We cannot return to the surface to fight evil
if we continue to fight each other.
But, Master Splinter, how can I be expected to do so…
There are no excuses when you are the leader, my student.
We have to go out and find who's responsible for this.
There ain't no other solution.
Save the brute-vigilante junk for that Nightwatchman.
-Nightwatcher. -[Michelangelo] Nightwatch-er. Yeah, whatever.
I'm going out.
[newscaster] Witnesses say  there are holes in the floors
as if something or someone had just blasted straight down through them
leaving authorities  scratching their heads.
leaving authorities  scratching their heads. [sighs] Well, at least some people care about justice these days.
[sighs] Well, at least some people care about justice these days.
[Raphael whispering] Hey, Casey.
-Raph? -Meet me on the roof, okay?
What is it?
The roof. You know what the roof is, don't you?
Pushy sidekick.
[newscaster] We've gotten this image in from an amateur cameraman
and I do stress "amateur."
Casey, come look at this.
Be safe.
What's this all about, Raph?
We got bigger things to worry about than I think criminals.
Like what?
-[Casey] Whoa! -[Raphael] Come on.
[Casey] I think we lost it.
It's gotta be around here somewhere.
[Casey] I don't think so.
What's going on, Raph?
Did I mention we ran into a monster last night?
No, you kind of failed to tell me about that one, buddy.
[Casey] You do know I only have a wooden bat, don't you?
The Foot? I thought they were history.
And now we got walking statues? You got a plan for those?
Yeah. Hey, Those are a first for me too.
And who knows? These guys might be friendly.
Friendly.
Wait a second. Those statues look… Oop…
[Gato] Witnesses.
[Raphael] Watch out.
I don't feel so good.
[Raphael] That can't be good.
[Casey coughs] That's just rude.
[gasps] Hey, wait up.
-Raph? -Come here.
-[Raphael] What, you never heard of smoke pellets? -Warn me next time.
[coughs] I got allergies.
[Casey] Come on. That's the second mask this week.
[Raphael] They'll never find us in here.
Stay with me, now. We'll be out of here soon.
And I thought Girl Scouts were pushy.
Some people just can't take a hint.
[officer] This is the police.  You on the roof,
put your hands behind your…
What is that?  Tommy, you see this?
Yeah, you better run.
I gotta hand it to you, Raph.
You sure know how to show a lady a good time.
Raph?
Oh, no. I gotta get you someplace safe, pal.
My compliments to the chef.
[chuckles] Anyone for dessert?
-No! -Yes.
Cowabunga Carl Party Services.
Cowabunga, dude.
[April] Raph's hurt. You need to get over here right away. Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, April.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, April.
What happened to Raph? I don't know. He's unconscious.
I don't know. He's unconscious. [sighs] We'll be right there.
Leo! You came back.
Leo!
Sorry the reunion isn't under better circumstances. [chuckles] Whoa.
Nice pad, kids.
Oh, hey, Raph.
Well, his vital signs seem to be okay.
Pupil dilation is normal.
Some sort of stone.
Probably obsidian, I think.
Well, is he gonna be all right?
You're still here? Go back to your jungle.
Well, at least his personality's still intact.
And there's an engraving on it. Looks South American.
That's your department, April.
Would it help things if I told you
that those statues you collected for that Winters guy
were shooting these things at me and Raph?
"The Legend of Yaotl."
It can't be.
It was just a myth.
A scary story the locals told kids around a campfire.
Whoa, what are you talking about?
They say 3,000 years ago,
some great warrior actually found a portal to another dimension.
And when the portal opened,
the energy from it gave the warrior eternal life.
But it also turned  his generals to stone.
What if this warrior  just kept living forever?
He would spend the rest  of his days in regret,
spending all of his riches  and all of his power
to find a way to revive  his stone generals.
Maybe, just maybe,  he's built a new empire.
But, hey, like I said, it's just a myth.
Hmm, if you ask me, guys, this has Winters' name
Hmm, if you ask me, guys, this has Winters' name written all over it.
How do you figure that, Donnie?
[both] Yeah.
Because this has Winters' name written all over it.
Now I know who to thank for this shot in the arm.
So where do we find this guy and his stone jokers?
We're not going anywhere until we get Splinter's blessing.
You're going to stand here and quote a rulebook to me
that you ain't been following for a year?
Look, Raph, if you got something you wanna get off your shell, now's the time.
But I'm not gonna stand here and debate Splinter's direct orders with you.
Fine, then. I quit.
Hey, Raph. Don't do it, man.
Sometimes, just taking a breather is the best thing to do.
[sighs] Whatever.
To picking up the pieces.
What is it?
Two creatures remain, my lord.
Well, by all means, then, let's finish it.
And you will finally be free of your stone prison.
But if the curse is broken, we will no longer be immortal.
Brother, do not question my command.
-[rock and roll music playing] -Yeah! Here we go, now.
[April] So what are we looking for?
Well, according to these star charts,
the portal is set to open directly over Winters Tower
in the next 24 hours.
[April] So the legend is right. 3,000 years.
And when the portal opens,
we'll lose the city to monsters within hours.
Within days, the country.
And within weeks, the world.
Oh, so it's like Halley's Comet, only monsters come out?
Um… Yes, I… I guess so.
[chuckles] I'm smart.
I'm okay.
Why do we need Raph anyway?
It's his temper that always jeopardizes all our missions.
Okay, Leo. Whatever you say. Nobody was talking about him.
Leonardo, this team you are so eager to lead is incomplete.
You know what you must do.
Yes, Sensei.
[Aguila] Generals, I think our brother has plans to betray us.
The 13th monster must not be found.
[newscaster] Why don't we take one more call about these monster sightings?
Suffern, New Jersey, you're on.
Monster sightings. [scoffs]
[Dispatcher] Attention,  all on-duty officers.
Report of a disturbance  on 32nd.
No units available.
They're playing my song.
Where… Where are the cops? How come the cops haven't shown up?
Just remember what my analyst said, just go to my happy place.
Just go to my happy place it's gonna be fine. Happy place. I'm feeling good. I'm thin.
Happy place. I'm feeling good. I'm thin. -Don't get up. -[continues indistinctly]
-Don't get up. -[continues indistinctly] I'll serve myself.
Oh, look at you. Ain't you cute?
You want a butt-kicking, little fella?
[baby-talk] Yes, you do. You do.
Come on, I'm gonna drop-kick you to hurty town.
Come on, little guy.
Get off of me, you little monster!
-You're scratching the helmet. -[cackling]
Okay, that was different.
Hey, this thing ain't rustproof! Get off of me!
Come on.
How about a snack, little fella?
Catch!
Keep on running, you filthy little hermit crab.
That spicy meatball's on the house.
[exclaims] Big guy, please don't hurt me.
What? I'm not robbing you, I'm helping you.
Okay, whatever you say, sir. Please, I got kids in college.
Community college.
[grunts] Here you go, pal. -Make sure this is safe. -Take everything.
-Make sure this is safe. -Take everything. I'm not even looking. Go.
[Nightwatcher] Why is it everyone's got such a hard time -believing I am a good guy? -[man] Don't worry about it.
[Nightwatcher] I just saved your life.
[sighs] This night just keeps getting better and better.
I want you to know that I appreciate your intentions,
but you can't change the world like this.
-[muffled] The road you're on is a dead end. -[Nightwatcher] Is he kidding? -I've tried it. -He's lecturing.
[aloud] So I'm gonna give you one chance to just walk away and stop this vigilante nonsense.
to just walk away and stop this vigilante nonsense.
Okay, Leo, time to teach you a lesson.
Look, trust me when I tell you, you don't want to do this.
[chuckles] Oh, yeah. Well, I noticed you got quite a temper.
Hey, have you ever done this before?
Oh, come on! You call that an attack?
All right, finally, some excitement.
Funny thing about anger…
Let it consume you, and soon enough…
…you lose sight of everything.
Good night, Dark Prince.
Raph?
What?
You are so smug, you know that?
You think the world revolves around you, don't you?
That we couldn't possibly survive
without the mighty and powerful Leonardo
to guide us through our problems, huh?
Well, I got a news flash for you.
We got along just fine without you.
Oh, and this qualifies as "just fine"?
Dressing up like it's Halloween every night?
Risking the safety of our family?
I mean, come on. What were you thinking?
Don't push it, Leo.
You can't leave home and come back expecting us to fall in line again like your little soldiers.
Hey, I was training,
training to be a better leader for you.
Why do you hate me for that? And whoever said I wanted to be led?
I'm better off calling my own shots.
Now get used to it!
You aren't ready!
You're impatient and hot-tempered.
And more importantly, I'm better than you.
Oh, you know something, big brother?
I have to disagree with you on that one.
Don't do this, Raph.
I'm done taking orders.
Not human, but clearly not the final monster.
Yaotl won't know the difference.
By the time our brother discovers this turtle is not the 13th monster,
it will already be too late.
Leo.
[shouts] Leo! Hang on!
Leo!
Leo!
[shouting] No!
-[grunts] -Raphael! What is the matter?
I was out. I was out and I did something.
Something happened and… And then, I… Then, I…
Raphael. Kneel.
I did something.
I did something really stupid, Master Splinter.
Go on.
I know why you chose him now.
I know that there's a reason why he's the better son, and I'm not.
Rafael. You always bear the world's problems on your shoulders.
It is an admirable quality when you are a protector of others.
But you must realize that while at times
you may not be my favorite student,
it does not mean that you are my least favorite son.
You are strong, passionate and loyal to a fault.
These are the merits of a great leader as well,
but only when tempered with compassion and humility.
But Master Splinter, I messed up big tonight.
I mean big.
They took him.
Leonardo.
Yeah.
Then the time for hiding is over.
We must return to the surface to take back what is ours.
By your wish, Father.
Long have we been in hiding.
Perhaps too long.
Well, what do we do now?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We're gonna rescue our brother,
and then we're gonna save New York City.
Whoa.
I got it on my last trip to Japan. -You like it? -Oh, yeah.
-You like it? -Oh, yeah.
No way.  ♪ But they sure love to stare ♪
Oh!
You can't go trick-or-treating without your mask.
Oh, babe. Thanks.  ♪ I may be ugly… ♪
As ordered, no one gets into the tower.
No one interferes. No one bears witness.
You've got to be kidding me.
[Casey] Uh, [laughs sheepishly] Cowabunga, dude!
Uh, I'm here for little Maxie's 13th birthday party?
[Karai] Leave. Now.
[Casey] Oh, you don't understand, lady. I got…
[Winters] At last, after 3,000 years,
the time is finally at hand.
What? What have you done?
Your time for giving orders is over.
[Winters] You don't understand.
I want to send these creatures back to where they came from.
To undo the damage that was done so many years ago.
Time had done nothing but made you weak.
We have our own plans.
Immortality is a curse, brother.
Trust me. I've lived long enough to know.
We have to find that 13th monster.
-It's time to end it. -No!
Our time is just beginning.
-[Raphael] A little help, Don! -[Donatello] I'm on it!
[Michelangelo] Heads up, dudes!
-[ninjas groaning in pain] -[ninja yells]
[April] Guys! Front door's open. Now!
Two minutes for high sticking.
Dudes, that rocked! Let's go again.
Dudes, what do we do? I'm working on it.
You break it, you buy it. -[Casey grunts] -[alarm blaring]
Yeah! All right!
-[Casey] All right! Nice. -[Michelangelo laughs]
-Nice work, Jones. -Oh! [chuckles nervously] I have my moments.
Whoa! Check it out.
That would be the swirling vortex to another world, I assume.
[Casey] Cool. I want one.
Leo? Is that you? -[roaring] -[Michelangelo] Oh!
-[thuds] -Sorry! Wrong cage.
[Raphael] Leo! I got him!
[Donatello] Out of the way, please.
Hey, buddy. Come on, man. Up we go.
-[Leonardo groans] -[Raphael] There you go.
You're gonna need these if you're gonna lead us out of here.
I'm gonna need you, too.
-[April] Winters? -[Michelangelo] Looks more like fall, get it?
Mikey, remember our talk.
Looks like someone got to him before us.
[April] Is he dead?
Not so immortal, huh, dudes? -[gasps] -[all exclaim]
[April] Your time's run out, Winters.
Miss O'Neil.
I must have hit my head pretty hard,
I'm seeing giant turtles.
We know what you're up to, Winters.
We know about the portal and we think that it's time
We know about the portal and we think that it's time you sent all these monsters home.
[Winters] I couldn't agree with you more.
It is time to put an end to the curse that I have brought upon myself and this world.
to the curse that I have brought upon myself and this world.
That's what this is about, Miss O'Neil. Penance.
I must return all 13 beasts or our curse will continue.
And that is a torment I can no longer bear.
[Aguila] Then you should be put out of your misery.
I think we walked in on a family feud, guys.
The time has come to reopen the portal
and rain destruction upon the Earth.
Nothing will stand in our way
when we have an army at our command.
-My brothers. I… -We are no brothers to you!
With one monster still free, the curse will never be broken!
We shall finish what we began all those years ago.
And we will finally have our victory.
Join us. Join us, Foot Clan.
Swear your allegiance to us and no harm will befall you.
[scoffs] The Foot Ninja is not without honor.
We work for Winters, not you.
Okay, what does that mean?
It means we're going to help you.
My ninja will find the last monster,
and you will bring it back here.
Hurry, we don't have much time.
Hey. I got shotgun!
[Aguila] Forget about them.
By the time they return,
the portal will already be closed…
with you inside it.
I hate to see brothers fight like this.
Unless it's together.
Hate to rain on your parade, pal,
but we thought we'd even the odds.
We're going to enjoy this.
[Splinter speaks Japanese] [in English]If you please.
They can defeat them. They are a team.
[Winters] Let's hope so. Because if not, Aguila will use the portal
Because if not, Aguila will use the portal to draw forth an army of evil and the world will be lost.
to draw forth an army of evil and the world will be lost.
More beasts.
Let's send them back where they belong.
-[groans] -[Donatello] Temper, temper.
Come to daddy.
[Raphael] Thing about you immortal stone guys is,
you know, you're immortal and made of stone.
I sound like Mikey.
You fight well. You should join us.
No, thanks, I'm good.
[Michelangelo] These guys really don't die. Sensei, are you all right?
[chuckling] We must do this more often. Hi-yah!
I still got it.
They'd better hurry with that last monster.
I'm sure my man Casey's got it all under control.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Can't this piece of junk go any faster?
-You wanna drive? -I would, as a matter of fact.
You would think they would be more concerned about the 13th monster.
Boys, we must finish this now!
So did we win?
[chuckling] Foolish creatures.
We are immortals made of stone!
Without the final monster to break our curse,
we will never be stopped!
[Casey] Special delivery!
-[Winters] Look out! -[turtles groan]
[Michelangelo] So did we win now?
[Donatello] Yeah, I think we did.
-[all cheering] -All right! Yeah!
-That's what I'm talking about! -[grunts]
-[wheels squeaking] -[Casey] Nice parallel parking.
Next time, I'm driving.
-[thudding] -[Casey] Hey! Watch the hair. -[April] Oh! -[ninja] Oh.
[Raphael scoffs] Typical. We do all the work,
he gets all the thanks.
You are every bit the warriors I was informed you were.
You have passed.
Savor your victory tonight.
For soon, we will have further business together.
The kind that involves familiar faces from your past.
She doesn't mean…
Looks like you picked a good time to come home.
Thanks… for bringing me back.
Winters?
I'm never usually that happy to be in pain.
[Donatello] He's happy because he's mortal again, Mikey.
April. I've had my eye on you for a long time.
I knew it.
I've always known that you'd be the one to help me find my way home.
And thank you… brothers.
You've made a very old man very, very happy.
So, um, what happens now?
Okay. Just a little bit creepy.
[sneezes] Oh, gross! I think he's in my…
[sneezes] Oh, gross! I think he's in my… My… My… [sneezes]
Oh, gross!
Somebody give me a hankie.
Oh. Oh! Now he's in my mouth.
[groans] Tastes awful!
[Raphael] You got room for one more?
[Michelangelo] Uh, can I get rid of this, too?
[Raphael] We live together. We train together. We fight together.
We stand for good, together.
We are ninjas.
We strike hard,  defend, protect,  and fade into the night.
defend, protect,  and fade into the night.
And there ain't no bad guy  or monster gonna  ever change that.
That's what's important.
And that's why  we'll always be brothers.
Oh, I love being a turtle.
Yo momma's breath smells like rusty pennies!
Yo momma's breath smells like salamander stew.
Yo momma drink country club out of the bottle. A baby bottle.
Yo momma smells diseased!
Yo momma got leprosy in gold Nikes.
Yo momma smells like a problem! Ha! Boo!
Hey, I was doing some research for next year...
...and I think I figured out which website I wanna subscribe to.
-The Vag-tastic Voyage. -Which one is the Vag-tastic Voyage?
-The Vag-tastic Voyage. -Which one is the Vag-tastic Voyage? The Vag-tastic Voyage is the one where...
The Vag-tastic Voyage is the one where...
...they find random girls on the street, and they invite them into a van...
...and then they bang them in the van.
It's like 13 bucks a month...
...and you get access to other sites.
Like one's Latina, one's Asian, you know, there's one for fetishes...
...like feet and pee-pee and shit and stuff like that.
That's disgusting. You're like an animal.
I'm-- What? I'm disgusting? You're the weird one, man.
Don't make me feel weird because I like porn.
You're weird for not liking porn. I'm normal as shit.
Peeing on people. That's normal?
Evan, I'm not saying I'm gonna look at it.
I'm just saying that it comes with the site, okay?
I don't know what I'm gonna be into 10 years from now.
I'm just sick of all the amateur stuff.
I mean, like, if I'm paying top dollar, I want a little production value.
Like some editing, transition, something. Some music.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry the Coen brothers don't direct the porn that I watch.
They're hard to get ahold of, okay?
Plus your parents are gonna be looking at the bill, dipshit.
Yeah, you're right. I probably should pick the one with the least dirty name.
What about, like, Perfect Ten?
Something like that, you know? Like Perfect Ten?
Because that could be any number of things.
They can't really get you for that. That could be, like, a bowling website.
Yeah, but they don't really show dick going in, which is a huge concern.
I didn't realize that.
Plus, have you ever seen a vagina by itself?
Not for me.
Hi.
-Thanks for taking him, Seth. -No-- No problem, Jane.
-How are you? -Good.
Beautiful.
-Don't touch that. -What are you--?
-I'm not a piece of meat. -You two are funny.
I can't imagine what you're gonna do without each other next year.
Evan told me you didn't get into Dartmouth.
I got into some schools, some pretty good ones. So I'll be fine.
-You gonna miss each other? -No. Miss each other? No, thank you.
I don't-- I don't miss each other.
I'm gonna cry myself to sleep every night.
-Me too. -When I'm out partying.
Go to school, boys.
-Bye, Mom. -Bye, Jane.
I am truly jealous you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby.
Yeah, well, at least you got to suck on your dad's dick.
Hey, Seth, you can't park in the faculty lot.
Don't be such a vagine, man. I gotta get a Red Bull before class.
You're being an idiot. You shouldn't have parked there.
Fuck it. I'm about to graduate.
They should be sucking on my ball sac.
It's the least they could do for stealing three years of my life.
-Oh, fuck me. -Look at those nipples.
They're like little baby toes.
It's not fair they get to flaunt that stuff...
...and I have to hide every erection I get.
You know what I do? I flip my boner up into my waistband.
It hides it and it feels awesome.
I almost blew a load into my bellybutton.
I mean, just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners...
...and just, like, wanted to see them.
I mean, that's the world I one day wanna live in.
It's been two years since I've seen an actual human female nipple.
Shauna? Shauna was two years ago now?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so. But she was insanely hot.
Exactly. She was too hot, okay? That's what sucks.
How can that suck? I'd be psyched if I got with her.
You got, like, two dozen handjobs.
Yes, and three-quarters of a blowjob, but who's counting?
Look, it was the peak of my ass-getting career...
...and it happened way too early.
-You're like Orson Welles. -Exactly!
If I'd paced myself, I'd be having at least steady sex...
...with a decent-looking girl.
I honestly see now why Orson Welles ate his fat ass to death.
You'll have sex in college, everyone does.
But the point is to be good at sex by the time you get to college.
You don't want girls thinking you suck dick at fucking pussy.
I still think you have a chance with Jules.
She got incredibly hot over last summer...
...and she obviously hasn't realized it yet...
...because she's still talking to you and flirting with you.
Are you out of your mind? Look at Jules' dating record, okay?
She dated Dan Remick, who's had a six-pack since, like, kindergarten.
Jason Stone, who looks like fucking Zack Morris. And Matt Muir.
Matt Muir. He's the sweetest guy ever.
Have you ever stared into his eyes?
It was like the first time I heard the Beatles.
Why would she end her high school career with me?
Becca dated Eric Rosecrantz for like two years.
Yeah, but he's a fucking idiot. You're a step up from that dick-load.
That's why you need to stop-- Will you get this?
That's why you need to stop being a pussy and nail her.
You could bang her before you leave. And I'm not gonna dance around it, she looks like a good fucker.
And I'm not gonna dance around it, she looks like a good fucker.
I'm tired of you talking about her like that, man.
What, you can talk about her all day and if I say one thing, it's blasphemy?
Well, I don't constantly insult her.
I'm not trying to insult her.
I'm just saying that she looks like a good fucker, okay?
She looks like she can take a dick.
Some women pride themselves on their dick-taking abilities.
Dick-taking abilities? You think that's good to say about someone?
The fucked-up thing is, I actually do, okay? If a woman tried to compliment me on my dick-giving abilities, I'd be psyched.
If a woman tried to compliment me on my dick-giving abilities, I'd be psyched.
Hey, yo, Seth.
What?
Did you hear I'm having a big grad party next Saturday?
-No. -Yeah.
-Oh, shit! -You're not coming.
Tell your fucking faggot friend he can't come either.
So Jesse wanted me to tell you...
...you're a fucking faggot and can't come to his party.
You really bitched out back there, man.
I bitched out?
You bitched out, man, you fucking Judas.
You fucking left me hanging.
Did you want me to dive in front of his spit?
Come on, guys, let's go!
This is bullshit.
Pussy.
If I equals the square root of negative one...
...then I squared equals negative one. Okay?
In other words, if you consider I as a constant...
...you can then define the square roots of all the negative numbers.
So I is an imaginary number. It doesn't really exist.
If I equals the square root of negative one...
...then I squared equals negative one.
Is this making s--? Okay.
-Okay, bye. -Evan!
-Evan, hey. -Hey, Becca.
-Hey, thank you for your pen. -Hey.
No problem. No, no, don't worry. No worries. You keep it.
You won't have to borrow one again because you'll have that one.
-Thank you so much, that's.... -You're welcome. Don't worry about it.
So I was gonna ask you...
...did you hear about Jesse's grad party next weekend?
-It should be fun. -I heard. I-- It's a maybe.
-Really? -For me at the moment.
-My R.S.V.P. -Just a maybe?
So far.
There's so much other fun shit that's gonna be happening...
...that I can't really commit and, you know, hurt someone's feelings.
Fun shit? But I never see you at parties or anything.
That's because of all the other fun shit I'm off doing.
I'd love to be at all of them, but....
Why weren't you at Dimitri's on Saturday?
There was so many things going on.
I couldn't find a minute to make an appearance.
-What did you do? -Saturday was a crazy night for me.
I had some friends over, we had a few drinks.
That's Vag-tastic!
I hung out in my basement, the chill zone, where we chill-lax.
Like "relax" and "chill" all at once.
Seth's parents were throwing a party.
We got to hang around adults, which was a nice change of pace.
You converse, you talk to people and they have interesting stories.
I talked to a man who claimed he had climbed five mountains in his life.
Then we went to a nightclub, which was incredible. This big, fancy one.
-Gonna look at tits right now! -I'm feeling crazy. I said that.
-You got in? -We got right in.
-Wanna do this, 'roid monkey? -Fuck you!
Then we called it a night. We were all just really exhausted.
What the fuck?!
You would've loved it. It was an incredible, unbelievable night.
That sounds like a lot of fun.
You know, I'd love to go do something like that sometime.
Who wouldn't? I mean, it was like...
...me and Seth are always kind of cooking up these...
...fun, sort of, little, you know, events.
I guess you guys are really gonna go crazy next year together.
We were going to, but we got into different schools.
Really? That sucks.
Yeah, I mean, it's not too bad. I mean, it should be okay.
Not too worried about it, really.
Don't worry about it. I'm not worried at all.
-All right, well, thank you for the pen. -Yeah. No problem.
-Bye. -Bye.
Bye, Evan.
Mrs. Hayworth, I joined this class because I'd be cooking with a partner.
But she's never here, and I don't get twice the grades for doing all the work.
I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.
I know, but look at Evan, okay? Just look at him.
Don't keep me waiting much longer. I'm getting impatient up here.
You know what I'm talking about. Miroki, you're embarrassing me.
I'm here in my unit, isolated and alone, eating my terrible-tasting food...
...and I gotta look over at that.
Looks like the most fun I've ever seen in my life.
And it's B.S. Excuse my language. I'm just saying that I wash and dry.
I'm like a single mother.
We all know Home Ec is a joke, no offense.
Everyone takes this class to get an A. It's bullshit, and I'm sorry.
I'm not putting down your profession, but it's just the way I feel.
I don't wanna sit here alone cooking this shitty food. No offense. And I just think that I don't ever need to cook tiramisu.
No offense. And I just think that I don't ever need to cook tiramisu.
When am I gonna need to cook tiramisu?
Am I gonna be a chef? No.
There's three weeks left in school. Give me a fucking break.
I'm sorry for cursing.
All right, Jules' partner isn't here today either.
Pair up with her. Station four.
Jules?
All right. I'll give it another shot.
I'll give Home Ec another shot.
Yeah, Hayworth won't notice this, if we cover it with chocolate.
-The whole thing? -Just dump it on. I'm serious.
Okay.
-And now it looks professional. -That's really impressive.
-And now it looks professional. -That's really impressive. -It's beautifully done. -I think we're gonna get an A.
-It's beautifully done. -I think we're gonna get an A.
So, what are you doing tonight?
-Probably nothing. Why? -I don't know.
My parents are gone so I'm having a party.
I don't really know how many people are gonna be there...
...but you could stop by if you wanted to.
Yeah, I love parties.
Really?
I just don't really ever see you at them.
You know, it's a love-hate thing.
So, like, you know, right now, I really love them, though.
-Yeah. -Good shit, right, Miroki?
Yeah.
Hey, Miroki, could we have a minute alone? Just-- Thanks.
Dude, Jules is having a fucking party.
Hey!
-Don't tell Fogell about the party. -Gangsters. What's up, guys?
I was just walking down the hall and Nicola was right in front of me.
She's wearing these tight white pants with this black G-string...
...and you could see right through the pants. It was so sweet.
It's 10:33.
What?
I told her what time it was.
That's the coolest fucking story I've ever heard in my entire life.
That's the coolest fucking story I've ever heard in my entire life. -Can I hear it again? You have time? -Yeah, yeah, Seth.
-Can I hear it again? You have time? -Yeah, yeah, Seth.
I'll miss your knee-slappers when me and Evan are at Dartmouth.
While you guys are at Dartmouth, I'll be at State...
...where the girls are half as smart and twice as likely to fellash me.
What are you guys doing tonight? Asshole.
We got nothing. Nothing tonight, Fogell.
No? Well, if nothing comes up, we can get shitfaced again, yeah?
You're always calling me a pussy, but today you're wrong.
At lunch, I'm going to the same place Mike Snider went...
...to pick up my brand-new fake ID.
Yeah. Fake ID. Fake ID. I'm tight.
That's insane. Evan was like, "I heard about this party.
We shouldn't tell Fogell." I was like, "No, we should tell Fogell."
You could buy us booze now. It's awesome.
Yeah, I'll-- Sure, I'll buy the booze. Yeah, we're gonna get our drinks on.
We're gonna party and get crunk and rock out, dude.
If you're not in this class, leave this class.
Fogell! Hi.
Okay. Gotta go. Well done. Seriously. See you after class.
Well done. Seriously. See you after class.
You tell that idiot you're not rooming with him?
Not yet. No.
All right, well, you better. That guy's the fucking anti-poon.
Seth, it's dishes time. What's the holdup?
We're getting a fake ID, so....
It's not like a big deal.
Not a big thing.
Well, at least we're getting a graduation party.
Thank God, man.
I'm excited.
I would do terrible, disgusting things to hook up with Jules.
-Unforgivable things. -I hear you, man.
I'd give my middle nut to start dating Becca.
Becca's a bitch.
You know what? I'm seriously getting fucking sick of you...
...talking about her like that, if we can be honest.
-Me too. -Why do you hate her so much?
You've never given me a reason. I think you like her.
-Fuck no, man! I hate Becca. -Why, man?
Fine, Evan. Here it comes.
When I was a little kid, I kind of had this problem.
And it's not even that big of a deal.
Something like 8 percent of kids do it, but whatever. It's....
For some reason, I don't know why, I would just kind of sit around all day...
...and draw pictures of dicks.
What?
Draw pictures of dicks.
Dicks?
Like a man dick?
Yeah. Like a man dick.
I'd sit there for hours, drawing dicks. I don't know what it was.
I couldn't touch the pen to paper without drawing the shape of a penis.
-That's fucked. -No shit, it's really fucked up.
Here I am, this little kid...
...and I can't stop drawing dicks to save my own life.
All right. I mean, I don't see what this has to do with Becca.
Just listen. Okay?
Your precious little Becca sat next to me for all of fourth grade.
And in the classroom is where I did the majority of my illustrations.
I was very secretive about this whole dick operation I had going on. Even I thought I was fucking crazy.
Even I thought I was fucking crazy. Imagine what everyone else would think.
So I would stash all of my dick drawings... ...in this Ghostbusters lunchbox that I had.
So one day I'm finishing up this real big, veiny, triumphant bastard.
All of a sudden....
Pussy!
You hit Becca's foot with your dick?
Yeah. I know.
Oh, my God!
She starts crying. She flips out. And she rats me out to the principal.
He finds this Ghostbusters lunchbox dick treasure chest...
...and he fucking flips out.
He calls in my parents. Turns out this principal is some religious fanatic...
...and he thinks I'm possessed by some dick devil.
My parents make me see a therapist, and he's asking me dick questions.
They made me stop eating foods shaped like dicks.
No hot dogs, no Popsicles.
You know how many foods are shaped like dicks? The best kinds.
Yeah.
Well, I don't-- That's really messed up.
-Super gay. -All right, let's stop this madness.
-Let's just go get some dessert. -I can't, I gotta go meet my counselor.
-Let's just go get some dessert. -I can't, I gotta go meet my counselor. I'm picking out my classes for next year.
So I gotta sit and eat dessert alone, like I'm fucking Steven Glanzberg?
I gue-- Yeah, I mean, what do you want me to do?
I don't know. Nothing. It's fine.
-Just relax, man. I'll see you later. -That's fine. I'll be fine.
Hey, pussy.
Fuck off.
Just the one. Just the one. Not both.
-So I'll call Andy and Greg. -Okay.
And I'll bring the '80s dance music.
-Yeah, yeah. -Right on.
Seth! Hi. There you are. We were just talking about you.
-Here I am. -That's weird. Yeah.
So you're coming to my party tonight? Because it's fully on.
Yeah, why? Should I not come? Because I could think of other shit....
Oh, no. No. I want you to come, I just--
You said something earlier about, like, a fake ID or something, right?
Yeah, I'm gonna get one. For sure, for sure.
I'm getting that for sure.
Can you get us booze?
Yeah. I can. I can get you guys alcohol.
-Really? Seriously? -Yes, for sure.
That would be awesome. Thank you.
Because we were worried about that. That would be great.
Plus, you know, you scratch our backs, we'll scratch yours.
Well, Jules, the funny thing about my back... ...is that it's located on my cock.
So you do want alcohol? You want some or no? You do or you don't? You do want alcohol.
You do or you don't? You do want alcohol.
-Yeah. -Either way.
-Well-- -Either way. Either way's fine.
This is actually kind of a big favor.
Because my parents left me like 100 bucks to feed myself for the week.
But the house is full of food, so I just thought I'd spend it all...
...on, you know, extra drinks for the party, so....
That's really nice. I don't think I've ever done anything that nice.
-It's cool? -Yeah.
-Okay. Thank you. -Awesome.
I mean, seriously, that's really-- That's nice of you. Thank you.
So should I just get a shitload of different shit?
Well, you gotta get me some Kyle's Killer Lemonade.
Kyle's Killer Lemonade. That's kind of gay, but I can get it for you.
So-- Okay, so then we will see you tonight.
Go to the ball, guys.
Evan. Get into the game.
Kick it over to me.
Seth! Get off the field!
Get out of here. They're gonna make me run laps.
Just fucking listen, okay?
Jules and her stupid fucking friend asked me to buy her alcohol.
But not just her, for her whole party. You know what that means?
By some miracle, we were paired up and she actually thought of me.
Thought of me enough to decide I was the guy she would trust...
...with the whole fun-ness of her party. She wants to fuck me.
She wants my dick in or around her mouth.
Did you think that maybe she's using you to get her alcohol?
She doesn't want your dick.
She's got an older brother. She could have asked him.
She looked me in the eyes and said:
"Seth, mama's making a pubie salad. I need some Seth's Own dressing."
She's D.T.F. She's down to fuck, man.
P in vagi. She wants to fuck, man.
Tonight is the night that fucking is an actual possibility.
You sound like an idiot. You're not gonna sleep with her.
No. Dude, I know I talk a lot of shit, okay?
But she's gonna be at the party and she's gonna be drunk.
She likes me at least a little. At the very least, I'll make out with her.
Two weeks, handjob. Month, blowjob. Whatever.
And then I make her my girlfriend.
And I've got, like, two solid months of sex.
By the time college rolls around...
...I'll be like the Iron Chef of pounding vag.
Can we talk about this later?
What the fuck, Evan? We're down two points.
Fucking calm down, Greg. It's soccer.
-It's soccer. -Fuck you, man.
Hey, Greg, why don't you go piss your pants again?
-That was eight years ago, asshole. -People don't forget.
Do you wanna hear the best part? Becca.
You do the same thing with her.
When you guys are shitfaced, you get with her.
This is our last party as high school people.
I've ignored my hatred for Becca in coming up with this plan.
-I should buy Becca alcohol? -Yeah, it'll be pimp.
That way you know she'll be drunk. You know when girls say:
"I was so shitfaced last night. I shouldn't have fucked that guy."
We could be that mistake!
Have you talked to Fogell?
All right, you talk to Becca. I'll talk to that retard, Fogell.
Don't worry.
-Seth, get off the field! -Goal.
-You're getting that! -No, I'm not!
Hey, Becca. Hey, hold up.
-Oh, hey. -Hey.
Hi. Did you hear about the party tonight?
Yeah. Yeah, I just heard. It sounds awesome.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going.
-Really? -Yeah, I'm gonna go.
That's why I came looking for you.
Me and the guys are gonna go to a liquor store.
And I just thought, you know...
...if you needed someone to get you yours, I could do that.
I could be that person.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, that would be great.
That would save me such a hassle, because I was gonna beg my sister.
Could you get me, like, a bottle of Goldslick Vodka?
Yeah. That's the one with the little golden flakes in it?
-Yeah. The girly one. -That's classy.
Well, I'll pay you back at the party.
No, you won't. No, it's my treat, miss.
-Really? -Yep. That's that.
It's the first of many too, so get used to it, sister.
Well, thank you.
Yeah, no problem.
-I'm sorry. It was an accident. -It's okay.
I was gonna give you a nudge-- A punch, the friend thing.
I didn't mean--
-Hey, Becca. -Hey.
-Hey. -Gaby.
-What's up, Evan? -Hey, Gaby.
-We should get to class. -We're gonna go.
-So I will see you tonight. -Okay.
-Really, don't worry. -Okay. Sorry.
-Bye. -Sorry.
Bye.
Sorry.
Where's that sack of shit, Fogell? He said he'd be here.
I'm here with my thumb up my ass.
I did it, dude. I even offered to pay for it.
It was pimp. I feel like a pimp right now. -Like one of those pimps. -That is fucking pimp.
-Like one of those pimps. -That is fucking pimp. -That's what I was afraid of. -Why didn't I think of that? Shit.
-That's what I was afraid of. -Why didn't I think of that? Shit.
Sh-- We're screwed.
-Okay? We're screwed. -Okay.
That's what we fucking get for trusting Fogell.
He pussied out. I know it. He fucking pussied out.
How'd he get into Dartmouth? I don't get it. He's got shit for brains.
All right, how else can we get alcohol?
-Yo, guys! What's up? -Fogell, where have you been, man?
You almost gave me a goddamn heart attack.
-Let me see it. Did you pussy out? -No, no, man. I got it.
-Let me see it. Did you pussy out? -No, no, man. I got it. It's flawless. Check it.
Hawaii?
All right, that's good. It's hard to trace, I guess.
Wait, you changed your name to McLovin?
-Yeah. -McLovin?
What kind of a stupid name is that? Are you an Irish R & B singer?
They let you pick any name you want when you're there.
And you landed on McLovin?
Yeah, it was between that or Mohammad.
Why the fuck would it be between that or Mohammad?
Why not just pick a common name?
Mohammad is the most common name on earth. Read a fucking book.
Have you ever met anyone named Mohammad?
Have you ever met anyone named McLovin?
No, that's why you picked a dumb fucking name.
-Fuck you. -Give me that.
All right. You look like a future pedophile in this picture, number one.
Number two, it doesn't even have a first name. It just says McLovin!
What? One name?
One name? Who are you, Seal?
Fogell, this ID says you're 25 years old.
Why wouldn't you just put 21, man?
Seth, Seth, Seth. Listen up, ass-face.
Every day, hundreds of kids go into the liquor store with their fake IDs...
...and every single one says they're 21.
How many 21-year-olds are in this town?
It's called fucking strategy.
Let's stay calm, okay? Let's not lose our heads.
It's a fine ID. It'll-- It's gonna work. It's passable, okay?
This isn't terrible. I mean, it's up to you, Fogell.
This guy's gonna think, "Here's a kid with a fake ID"...
...or "Here's McLovin, the 25-year-old Hawaiian organ donor."
Okay? So, what's it gonna be?
I am McLovin.
No, you're not. No one's McLovin. McLovin's never existed...
...because that's a made-up, dumb, fucking fairy-tale name, you fuck!
Jeez, man. It'll work. Give it a chance.
Did you move my--?
Where is my car?
Oh, my God, man.
What did I say to you? I told you not to park here.
Why would you park in the staff parking lot?
Shut the fuck up, Fogell.
I mean, because you're not staff.
I know that, Fagell! I know that!
Evan, let's go to your house.
Wait, are you guys still picking me up from work?
Can you answer me?
Man, don't you have any non-infant clothes?
-It'll be fine. -Yeah.
Why don't you just wear what you wore to school?
I can't do that. I can't let Jules see me in what I wore to school.
It's completely unbecoming.
No one's gotten a handjob in cargo shorts since Nam.
I have to kill these guys. You don't negotiate with terrorists.
Really? Yeah, that's what we should be talking about right now.
Then why don't you go and get some of your own clothes?
That's the dumbest thing ever.
My parents will see that my car's been towed and I'll be grounded.
These fucking terrorists multiply like bunnies.
Where did I leave the M16?
Do you have any bigger clothes or do you only shop at babyGap?
Fuck me. I can't--
That's fun. Why do they make that?
If you can't even win, then why am I fucking playing?
Do you wanna go see what my dad has?
What the fuck?
What the hell is that?
It's a fucking vest, dumbass.
-I'm trying to look older. -You look like Pinocchio.
-It's just a vest. -They got a lot of booze in there.
If we get it now, we can get to the party faster with Jules' shit.
No way, man. I work there. They know I'm not 25.
Nobody said anything about you, dick-mouth.
You really fucked me on this one.
So now I'm gonna steal the booze.
Don't do this. I promise you I'll get the liquor later.
Mike Snider's ID always works. So will mine, man.
Mike Snider's ID doesn't have one fucking name on it! Okay?
I thought you Dartmouth guys would be smart enough to understand that.
Now Seth's gotta pick up all the pieces.
He won't do it. Don't worry.
I forgot to tell you, my mom said we can have the TV from the basement--
Shut the fuck up, he's gonna hear you.
Just be quiet. Wait until he goes away.
You still haven't told him that we're rooming together?
Fogell, shut the fuck up.
And take off your vest. You look like Aladdin.
Okay. You got it.
Hope piggy can run.
How old are you?
Twenty-two.
You certainly are. That'll be 80 dollars.
Okay.
Thank you kindly. Will that do?
Certainly will. Thank you, Seth.
Hey, thank you.
You dropped your purse, ma'am.
Would you like some help?
Well, that would be lovely, young man.
Would you like me to buy you alcohol?
That would be lovely.
-Enjoy your remaining years. -I will.
-Enjoy fucking Jules. -I will.
Don't do it, kid.
I never had a choice.
You fucking killed her!
No!
Where's all the stolen liquor? Did you hide it up your butt?
Piss off! I was gonna do it, but there was a security breach.
You never would've done it.
Let's go to a liquor store and watch your stupid ID get rejected.
Wait, I'm gonna go put my vest back in my locker.
All right. Here we are. This is it. -You ready? Yeah? -Yeah.
-You ready? Yeah? -Yeah.
-Here's the money and the list. -Change is yours. Keep the change.
-Thank you. What's the list for? -The alcohol.
We're gonna get alcohol for the whole party, okay?
We put a lot of time into this list, so don't fuck it up. It's perfect.
Ouzo, bourbon, spiced rum, Goldslick....
Goldslick Vodka. That's for Becca. Don't forget that.
Raspberry vodka, Scotch....
And Kyle's Killer Lemonade. A six-pack.
This is a lot. I don't know if I can get away with all this.
What difference does it make?
I don't know, man. I'm, like, really nervous.
-Are you okay? -No, man. I should have wore the vest.
-Calm down. -What the fuck are you doing?
What if I go in and they turn me down, man?
Then we're in the same place we're in now.
-Who cares? -It's fucking humiliating!
Everybody sees them kicking me out.
What if they make me put the liquor back? I can't do that.
This whole thing is bigger than you, Fogell!
So grow a pair of nuts and fucking walk in there and buy the alcohol!
What if I don't feel like it anymore, Seth? What?
Then I'll fucking kill you, okay?
I'll stab you through your fucking heart.
No, you can do this, man. Come on.
Killing me won't get you alcohol. I'm the one with the fake ID.
Then I'll cut your dumb fucking face off...
...throw it over mine and get your ID and buy it my fucking self!
Oh, really? You don't have the technology or the steady hands...
...to pull off a procedure like that, so ha!
Peace.
Fogell, just be cool, man. Get in and get out.
You're the hero.
Sorry.
Is there a problem here, sir?
No. No problem whatsoever.
Sir, did you do this? On the floor?
No.
And you should really clean this up.
Someone could really hurt themselves.
Fuck my life.
We're so fucked. We're so fucked.
This plan's been fucked since Jump Street.
Okay, just calm down. Just calm down, all right?
Hey, so did you bring a condom for tonight?
You brought a condom with you?
Yeah. I figured I might as well, you know?
I brought a little bottle of spermicidal lube too.
You laughed in my face when I said I'd be having sex tonight.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't always be prepared.
-You didn't even bring a condom? -No.
No, Evan, that wasn't part of the plan.
You did this without consulting with me.
We've never discussed, like, any plan, but you keep saying we have a plan.
I had, like, a general outline. You know?
I was gonna go down on her for, like, several hours, okay?
She would love that. She'd be smitten. She'd go out with that.
Or I dry hump the shit out of her leg.
Well, I just-- I don't see the harm in bringing one little condom.
And one little bottle of spermicidal lube?
Yeah, one little bottle of spermicidal lube.
-Evan, that's psycho shit, man. -No, it's not.
That's, like, Charles Manson shit.
What, do you think Becca's gonna be psyched that you brought lube?
"Oh, Evan. Thank you for bringing that lube for my pussy.
I never would've been able to handle your fucking 4-inch dick...
...inside my pussy without that gigantic bottle of lube."
-Okay, that's-- That's enough. -Fuck.
These girls are 18, they're not dried-up old ladies.
-They're good to go. -Then I won't bring the lube.
Hello, Mindy.
I love that stuff. Been drinking it for years.
You know, I heard they recently decided to add more hops to it.
Okay.
I'm gonna need to see some identification.
Really?
Makes me feel young again. There you go.
Oh, shit, it's Cary Hutchins.
She had the biggest tits I've ever seen.
I heard she got breast-reduction surgery.
What? Making your tits smaller?
That's like slapping God for giving you a gorgeous gift.
She had back problems, man.
And it's not just making them smaller. They completely reshape them.
They make them more supple and symmetrical.
I gotta catch a glimpse of these warlocks. Let's make a move.
-She's going around the corner. -Come on!
Okay. Your total is 96.59.
I don't believe it!
Are you okay, mister?
What the shit was that?
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
I don't know, man. I think she looked better before.
But now that she can jog comfortably, she's in the best shape she's ever--
What is this? What's that?
Oh, man.
Holy shit, they busted Fogell.
How did this happen, Evan? Fuck, man!
His dad's gonna fucking kill him.
Look, okay?
He assaulted the customer, grabbed the cash and ran out.
So....
-How--? -How--? How--? How--?
-Say when, height-wise. -I'm gonna start up here, tell me when.
-I'll start on the bottom and-- -When.
Whatever 5'10" is, he was 5'10".
Ethnically, I mean, did-- What--?
I mean, was he--? Was he like us, or--?
A woman?
-Female? -No.
-Is that what you're asking? -No, no. Was he--?
-Like.... -What? What?
-African? -Af-- Af--
-Was he African? -African.
No. He was American, and he was like you.
-He looked just like you. -He was Jewish. Okay, Jew.
-It's an odd crime for a Jew. -They're pretty docile.
Okay, so we have an African Jew wearing a hoodie.
Look, I can't do this. I told you already, I have an exam tomorrow.
Can you understand that? I have a goddamn veterinary exam!
Goddamn it. This is bullshit.
This is some bullshit. I got an exam tomorrow. Forget this.
Well, apparently someone has an exam.
How'd you know?
You. You're the one that got punched?
-Yeah. -Okay.
First things first. What is your name?
My name?
It's M-- McLov-- McLovin.
McLovin?
Yeah.
Now, what's your first name?
What?
-Your first name? -My first name?
Technically I don't have a first name, so don't worry about my first name.
But we're the police.
We just wanna get the story straight.
-Come on. -Fuck, man.
-Come on! -He must be so afraid.
I don't believe this bullshit. I can't believe this is happening!
I didn't know you could get arrested for this shit. We need that liquor.
-Are they gonna take him downtown? -Fuck Fogell.
He got arrested, okay? We're on our own. We need a new way to get liq--
Fuck! The money, man! Fuck! How much money can you get?
Why are you talking about money? What about Fogell?
That doesn't matter anymore. I lost a hundred dollars of Jules' money.
Are we gonna bust him out of jail? Bake a cake with a fucking file in it?
Fuck Fogell. We need a new way to get liquor, which is fucking impossible.
All right, you need to calm down. We need to think for a second.
-We need to think this out. -Fuck thinking, we need to act!
Seth!
-What the fuck happened? -Just-- Just get up. Slowly.
You all right? You okay?
I am so sorry, man. I am so sorry.
I didn't even effing see you at all, man. Are you okay?
So it's just McLovin?
Yeah.
-That's badass. -That is badass.
-Really cool. -A badass name.
-Lot of people with weird names. -Chingy. Shakira.
Rafe. Pax.
We arrested a man-lady who was legally named "Fuck."
Think he was Vietnamese, it was with a P-H.
But it's still shocking to see on a license.
-Okay, and how old are you, McLovin? -Old enough.
Old enough for what?
To party.
Can I see your ID?
Yeah, I think I have it.
-You're an organ donor. -What?
I didn't wanna, but my wife insisted.
I give him shit for it too. All the time.
I say, "It's just like a woman. Even after you're dead...
-...they wanna tear your heart out." -They wanna tear your....
-I say it weekly and it's still funny. -It still makes me laugh.
-Really funny. -There you go.
I'm sorry, guys. I don't really have any information.
He just hit me, and I didn't see what he looked like.
-I don't know if I can help you. -You in a hurry?
Yeah, kind of had to catch that bus.
-Where were you headed? -Near 13th and Granville.
-We can take you there. -Get your information on the way.
-Why waste 2 bucks? -We'll take you. No problem.
Please don't report me, man. We can figure this out, right?
Why the fuck wouldn't I report you? You just hit me.
I'm gonna be totally honest with you.
I have a warrant out for a totally nonviolent crime. Okay? There. Mercy Street, guys.
Okay? There. Mercy Street, guys.
I'll be honest with you for a second.
You better get us a shitload of cash or a shitload of alcohol...
...or you're going to fucking prison.
What are you doing, man? You don't need to--
No, let's not-- Let's hang on a second here.
-Cough it up. -Fine.
I don't know if we should be doing anything too official just yet.
I don't know if we should be doing anything too official just yet. Just take it. Just take it. Okay?
Just take it. Just take it. Okay?
Seven dollars?
What the fuck? This isn't enough. What are you, 6 years old?
-It's all I have, man. It's all I have. -You better think of something quickly.
-My back! My back. Cops, my back. -No, no, no. Wait, don't do that.
You want booze? I can get you alcohol, okay?
Bro, I'm on my way to a party right now, okay?
There's, like, tons of liquor there, all right?
And I can definitely get you, like, tons of liquor, like so much liquor, so....
-Give me one sec to talk to him. -Stay right here.
Just talk it out. Hey, I'm a nice guy.
I don't like this idea. This guy's fucking creepy, man. Look at him.
What? He looks like a guy. That's what guys look like.
-What is your problem? -You guys know a guy named Jimmy?
You totally look like his brother.
You totally look like his brother, man.
You do.
You promised Becca you'd get her alcohol.
If you don't, she's gonna have a shitty night.
That's all I'm saying. Come on.
-Good luck on your exam tomorrow. -Good luck on your exam.
-You don't wanna ride the bus. -Buses smell like piss, generally.
-You know why? -Why?
People piss on them.
You know, one of you bros could've come up and sat up with me.
-We're fine back here. -Back's fine.
Safe in the back seat.
-Oh, my God. -What's up?
-Hey, Jules. -Who is it? Who's on the phone?
Seth. Hey, where are you?
I'm in a cab right now, on the way to a liquor store.
Good. I can't wait for you to get here.
Well, I hope your friends are ready to get fucked up.
I'm sure they will be.
-Okay, I'll see you soon. -Peace.
Oh, man! Dude, this is crazy.
She called, she said, "I can't wait for you to get there."
That sounds like she fully wants it, man! Oh, yeah!
Who's gonna give it to her, huh, my man? You, that's who.
Man.
You guys on MySpace, or...?
Officers? I can answer those questions now if you want me to.
We get the gist of it. You were buying beer, some guys punched you.
Don't worry about it. We're not gonna find them.
-Case closed. -But it was only--
-But it was only one guy. -Only one guy? Shit.
How am I supposed to find one guy?
This job really isn't how, you know, shows like CSI make it out to be.
When I first joined the force, I assumed there was semen on everything...
...and there was some, like, huge semen database...
...that had every bad guy's semen in it. There isn't.
It'd be nice. Like that crime scene today.
If the man had ejaculated and then punched you...
...we'd have a shot at catching him.
-No way. -Just punched in the face, no semen.
-No semen. -Story of my life.
Michaels here, he's six months in.
He's young, but the Force is strong with this one.
Learning you are, young padawan.
Thank you very much.
-That's Yoda. -Are you familiar with Yoda?
From Attack of the Clones?
We have a 245 at East 24 and Montgomery, Bailey's Bar and Grill.
Car 98 on it.
See, Michaels, you always take a call at a bar because...
...better or worse, you get a beer out of it.
Pretty sweet, huh?
-True that. Amazing thinking. -Hey, McLovin.
We got a situation at Bailey's, so we'll drop you off after, all right?
Actually, I kind of have to be somewhere--
-Sweet. Sit tight. -Set course for Bailey's, warp 10.
-Sweet. Sit tight. -Set course for Bailey's, warp 10. Engage.
Yeah. Welcome to the Thunderdome.
Hey, man, are you sure it's cool that we're here with you?
Oh, definitely, man.
I'm essentially best friends with the guy... ...so a bunch of my buds are coming.
We're gonna rock out with our cocks out. Just kidding.
-We are gonna rock out. -Just go, just go.
What's up? What's up? What's up?
Hello, hello. Hey, guys.
This is something a smart person wouldn't do.
Look, just act cool and act casual, and try and look old.
We'll get the booze and get the fuck out of here, okay?
Come on. Come on, now. It's Mark's party.
Come on. Do it up.
We should grab one of these buckets and get out.
Are you out of your mind? How are we gonna get a fucking bucket out?
Hey, man.
What the fuck do you think you're doing?
-What are you--? What? Nothing. -You using my phone?
You weren't invited. Get the fuck out of here.
-Come on, Mark. It's cool, man. -You using my fucking phone?
You calling your fucking friends again?
You calling your friends, your fantastic friends?
Get the fuck out of my house. Get the fuck out of my house.
Get the fuck out of my house. Get the fuck out of my house. Get the fuck out of my house.
Get the fuck out of my house. -This is my house. -Don't be such a dick, man!
-This is my house. -Don't be such a dick, man!
Mark! You really wanna do this, man?
Here we go. We're really gonna do this?
That's right, motherfucker.
Come on, pussy. Get up, dude.
Oh, shit. I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry, bro.
Tiger got out of the cage, man. All right? I'm sorry. Come on, Mark.
Tiger got out of the cage, man. All right? I'm sorry. Come on, Mark. Let's just chill. Everyone just chill out.
Truce, man.
Right in the nads!
This is for your friends. Here, have another one.
Shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit. Oh, my God. What do we do?
-Come on. come on. -Choose one.
-We can slip out the back, man. -Come on. Let's hurry up and do this.
Are you crazy, man? Wanna end up like that guy?
Not me. I need my nuts, man, for a lot of things.
-We need liquor. -You need it. I don't.
I'm gonna tell Becca how I feel. Maybe she'll get with me.
I'm not gonna get her drunk out of her mind.
Oh, really? Then how come you never made a move, you pussy?
Because I respect her, Seth. I'm not gonna put unfair pressure on her.
I don't see a problem. Let's just do it.
We're leaving, okay? You wanna get killed for liquor?
No, but I would get killed for pussy, no questions asked.
-Fuck this, man. -You're just gonna bail on me?
-I'm going. -Fucking bitch.
Move, people.
-Thank you. -Oh, I love this place.
What the hell is going on in there?
If the bullets start flying, hit the deck.
You pissed everywhere, you son of a bitch!
Everywhere? You didn't see me pissing anywhere. I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Take your nuts out of your shells!
Michaels, I got your back. Why don't you show this rummy how we roll?
10-4.
Excuse me, sir. Stop what you are doing at once.
-Blue guys! -Resisting. Resisting!
-Slater! -Michaels!
Everybody stay calm.
-Everybody stay calm. -Get the fuck out of my way!
Stay calm! Fuck!
-Should I shoot him? -No, no, no!
-No! -Stop him, McLovin!
McLovin, stop him! Do it, do it, do it, do it!
Please stop it, you fucking bum. What the fuck?
McLovin! Nice!
He just came at me. I took him down.
-I'm buying you a beer, McLovin. -I'm buying you one too.
Take note. That's how you take down a motherfucker.
That's right.
McLovin in the fucking house!
Hey. You dance hot.
Thank you.
Okay, okay. Here we-- Here we go.
-Hello? -Evan, it's Becca.
Oh, Becca. Hi. Hey. Hello. Hey. Becca.
Hey. Hello. Hey. Becca.
-Becca-- -Evan, can you hear me?
-Hello? What? -Can you hear--? Piece of shit!
Guy sells me a piece of shit fucking phone.
-Becca? -It's Becca.
I get one bar everywhere I fucking go.
-What is he saying? -Fucking asshole.
-I think-- -What happened?
Son-of-a-fucking-bitch phone company.
-That's-- That's rude. Hello? -Fuck. You suck.
Bullshit phone. Piece of shit. I swear I'll bitchslap you so fucking hard.
I swear I'll bitchslap you so fucking hard.
-What? -Bec--?
Thanks.
This is fucking crazy.
Hey. Look what fell out of the truck!
You're full of shit.
Yeah, I know.
Dude. Dude. We're so gonna get fucked up.
-All right. -Hey.
What is that?
I don't know. What?
That fucking stain on your pants, idiot. What is that?
-What are you talking about, man? -Dude.
-Is that blood? -What the fuck is that?
-Are you bleeding? -I'm not cut or anything.
-Why would I be bleeding? -It's fucking blood, man.
Were you dancing with some chick in there?
-Yeah, so? -It's blood.
-Dude, that's not funny. -It's blood, dude.
But why would I be bleeding? Why the fuck would I be bl--?
Dude, why would there be bl--?
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God.
Oh, shit. I'm gonna fucking throw up.
Someone perioded on my fucking leg?
-Oh, shit. -What the fuck do I do?
I've never before seen that in my life!
This is so disgusting.
-Yes, it is. -I'm gonna go get Bill.
-He's gotta check this shit out. -Fuck, yeah.
No. Who's Bill? Don't tell Bill! Bill has nothing to do with this!
Hey, calm down. Let me get a picture of that real quick.
No, you can't have a picture!
-Dude, stop! -Bill, Bill! Check it out!
This kid's got period blood on his slacks.
It's merlot. That's what you don't get.
Hey, Pat! This jerk-off's got period blood on his pants!
-Please stop. -God, man, let me see.
Oh, my God, that's a fucking man-gina, man.
-Do you need a tampon? I could-- -Wait, wait. I have one! I have one!
Yeah, right? I don't know.
-I gotta wash this off. Is this the line? -What does it look like?
-I gotta wash this off. Is this the line? -What does it look like? Fuck me, right?
"Yeah, I'm McLovin. I'd like to buy some--"
Shit.
-Rewind, rewind. -Rewind it. Yeah!
So hot. Let's see it again.
-Your legs lifted off the ground. -That is bona fide badass, man.
You gotta keep that tape, McLovin. It is badass.
-It really is. -Really?
Well, don't you guys, like, need it for, like, evidence or...?
The only thing that's evidence of is you can take a hit like a champ.
Seriously. Take that.
Are there any ladies we'd like to show this tape to?
No. You don't wanna meet a chick in a bar, man. Seriously.
That was a turning point in my life, when I realized that.
You gotta go to other places. You gotta go to a spin class, a farmers' market...
...pumpkin patch, given the time of year.
Just somewhere social, non-threatening.
-You know, something like that. -Yeah, I met the missus at paintball.
Yeah, I shot her in the neck. And we just....
And we just hit it off, you know.
My first wife-- Who is a whore, by the way.
--where do you think I met her?
A bar. A bar.
-It was this bar. -It was this bar.
Yeah, it was this bar.
Bought her a Binion's, complimented her on her tote bag... ...and next thing I know, she's putting her mouth around the tip of my penis.
...and next thing I know, she's putting her mouth around the tip of my penis.
You don't have to tell me that.
-Right in there. -She opened up my world, sexually.
On our wedding night, we had group sex.
I wasn't involved in it.
-But I could hear it through the wall. -I was.
She was amazing. And then it was exactly 23 months later...
...that I found out she was an actual whore.
-We discovered her on the street. -Yeah.
I'm sorry.
She was bad. Fucking whoring bitch.
-But you got a new wife now, so.... -Yeah. Yeah.
And she is wonderful.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. -You'll meet her.
You know what? I bet I know your trick, McLovin.
-You play the whole myst-- -Calling all units.
Just turn that off.
Send backup! There's so much blood--
I bet you play the whole mysterious-guy thing, right?
Yeah, seriously. How's it going with the ladies?
It's not the going with the ladies I care about...
...it's the coming.
-I get it. -What is it? What is it?
Like:
Like coming.
-That's funny. That is really funny. -Oh, my God.
All right, looks like we got a call. We can't pay for these.
10-4. We'll be right there.
-Speedy Gonzales, let's go. -We should get road beers.
Hell, yeah, we should get some road beers.
Can I have 13 beers to go, please?
Please. God, my fucking leg.
Fuck.
-I think it's him. -Is it him?
-Hello? -Hey, Becca.
Hi, I had a bad reception. So about your Goldslick....
-Guys, shut up. -Hey, what's going on over there?
It's nothing. It's just--
I was just calling, you know, to see if you were coming... ...because I thought maybe you were stuck at, like, a nightclub...
...because I thought maybe you were stuck at, like, a nightclub...
...or a cocktail party or something.
No, no, I'm gonna be there for sure. Full throttle.
-Charlie's Angels 2. -Awesome.
-I can't wait to see you. Evan? -Okay, bye.
That was the first time I ever did coke. Off that bitch's nipple. That was so--
-A little white sniff. -That was awesome.
That was gorgeous.
Hey, hey, hey. You guys, stay in this room, man.
They're gonna kill that guy tonight. That chick's boyfriend is pissed.
Yeah. He's a beast.
I've been praying for a fight. I'm literally waking up and praying...
-...to see a fucking fight. -Hey, hey, hey.
Who's that guy?
-Hi. -Who is that guy? -Who's this guy? -Pleasure to see you fellas.
-Who's this guy? -Pleasure to see you fellas.
Hi, everyone.
-Who are you? -I'm nobody.
No, no, no. I know you. I know you.
He was at that party I was telling you about.
-No, no. -Who is it?
Remember? He's Jimmy's brother. The guy. The singer.
-No shit. -He's the guy with the beautiful voice.
-The fucking singer, Jimmy's brother! -That's not me, man.
-Oh, my God. -Sing for us! Sing.
"It's not me"? You fucking lying?
No, I don't mean to accuse you guys of being ill-informed, but--
My brother came from Scottsdale, Arizona to be here.
You're not gonna sing for him?
-Fucking bullshit. -Sing.
-You're a fucking singer. -You sing good.
-Sing it again. -Like a bird.
-No, I know, I just-- I want to. -You want a line of cocaine?
-No way, man. -Yeah.
Don't make this weird. Sing.
-Sing it again. -Turbo.
-Fuck! Over! -Okay, watch this.
I'll get it right on the nose.
You're gonna fuck it up. You're gonna fuck it up.
Under!
I feel hammered. That doesn't make any sense.
-You're a fucking pussy. -Okay, okay. Great, great.
-Okay, McLovin, see if you can do it. -The kid's gonna nail it.
Come on, McLovin. Do it, buddy. Come on, buddy!
-Bring it! -0.08, motherfuckers!
-Man! -That's my boy!
-Yes! -Beginner's luck. Beginner's luck.
So, what's it like to have guns?
It is awesome, McLovin.
-I mean, it's mindbl-- -It's great.
I haven't had one for long, a few months, but I'll tell you...
-...it's like having two cocks. -Yup.
If one of your cocks could kill someone.
-Can I hold one? -What?
Can I hold one of your guns?
-Yeah, sure. -Fine with me. Why not?
Everyone should hold a gun at least a couple times.
Yeah, there you go.
-Have a blast. -"Have a blast."
-That's funny. -I've never held one of these before.
-Are they hard to shoot? -If you're Michaels, they are.
-He can't shoot worth dick. -What?
I can shoot. What are you--? Wait.
-I can't shoot worth dick? -You cannot shoot.
-I shot that cat last week. -It was already dead, man.
-I still shot it. -That cat was dead.
There's only one way to settle this, guys.
-Shoot-off. -Shoot-off.
-Shoot-off! -Shoot-off!
Mark. Mark, that's him. Johnny Cash. Right there.
Oh, you got a stain too.
-We're blood brothers. -Shut the fuck up.
Where do you get off dancing with my fiancée?
No, I wasn't dancing. I don't even dance. That's the thing.
I've never tried it. So it's weird that you'd think that.
To some girl.
Talk about the hurting.
-Aw, shit. -All right.
-Yo! Fight! -Move it!
-Go, check this out! -Oh, fuck!
And what the hell is this?
-I don't fucking-- It's detergent. -Yeah, what are you doing with it?
I got fucking blood on my pants.
Get down.
What the fuck is this all about, man? Are you--?
-Well, fuck me. -Fellas.
Oh, shit, I've been tackled by little girls!
You die! You're next!
I should fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
-Hold him, Jimmy's brother! Hold him! -What do you mean? No. No way!
-You humiliated me! -I'm sorry!
-You used my leg as a tampon! -I'm calling the cops.
Evan! Come on! Move!
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
Yeah. Fifth and Paysview. Hurry.
Mark, I called the cops. You should hide your gun.
You're a fucking pussy.
Don't listen to him, officer.
If you make this, we're no longer friends, Michaels.
-You're a fucking pussy. -Cheating. You're cheating.
-Fuck me. -Oh, suck on my nuts, Slater!
All right, you-- That was a lucky shot.
-That was a lucky shot. -I rule.
I got jizzed on. All right.
-Can I shoot one? -Yeah, go nuts. Go nuts.
Have a good time, man.
Empty the clip. Empty the clip on it, man. Shit!
The cops! Bail! Bail! Bail! Shotgun, shotgun! Damn it!
Shotgun.
-What a rush. -What do you guys wanna do?
-Man, let's get drunk! -Let's get more fucked up!
You're fucking living the dream, Michaels!
Oh, man.
This is gonna be the best night ever.
-Got a 257 at Fifth and Paysview. -Shit.
All units in the area report to Fifth and Paysview.
-Car 98, that's you. Do it. -Fuck.
-Shit. -Shit.
Car 98 on it. You dumb fucking whore.
Hey, did she say we're gonna get to shoot somebody or something?
Oh, God, I wish.
It's probably some lame house party. We'll drop you off after. Cool?
Yeah, man. Let's show these fuckers how we roll!
-You fucking prick. -What?
-You bailed on me. -I didn't bail on you.
Yeah, you did.
You said you were gonna do something and you didn't do it.
That's bailing.
You're the one that dragged me to that fucking party with those lunatics.
-I didn't bail on you. -You bailed on me, okay?
You bailed on me this morning when Jesse spat on me...
...and you're bailing on me next year.
What the fuck? It finally comes out. That's good, man.
We were supposed to go to college together.
Since we were kids, since elementary school...
...that's all we've ever talked about, us going together.
And you got into fucking Dartmouth.
You're making me feel like I'm a bad guy.
What--? I didn't do anything wrong. I got into a good school.
How the fuck am I supposed to get into Dartmouth? You knew I couldn't.
How fucking selfish are you?
You had no problem letting Fogell take the fall.
You don't want me going to a good school.
-Fuck, man! -So what the fuck do you want?
I'm not gonna let you slow me down anymore, Seth.
What are you saying?
I've wasted the last three years sitting around talking bullshit with you.
Instead of chasing girls and making friends...
...I've just sat around wasting all my time with you.
And now I'm going to college a fucking friendless virgin.
Is this about Becca? This is about some girl, man?
-I like her! -Who gives a fuck?
She's some fucking girl! You gonna go out with her?
-What about after that? -Fuck you, you're a piece of shit.
Fuck you! And next time you're pissed off about something...
...don't keep it inside for 10 years, say it like a fucking man!
-Don't touch me. -Fuck you!
Hey, McLovin, are the numbers on your side odd or even?
-I don't know. It's too dark to see. -We got flashlights.
Oh, that's true.
Where the fuck are we?
-Hey, Slater. -What's that?
Slater.
Now, young Michaels, you will die.
All right. Come on, stop it. I can't fucking see. I can't see. Fuck it.
-Like it? -Hey, fuck off, that hurts.
-You stop first. -Not until you stop.
-Stop it, asshole. -Hey, you stop.
-Fuck you, Evan! -Don't fucking touch me.
-Why did you do that? -My God.
-Why did you do that? -My God. Are you guys gonna make sure he's okay?
-Check on him. -You check.
-You go out there and check on him. -Fuck that. You go.
Balls. Okay, we'll both go out there and check on him.
I can't believe this is happening again. What are the odds?
Fuck.
-Is everyone okay? -Yeah, we're great, thanks.
Hey, hey, where's the love?
-He's okay. He's fine. -Stand right next to your friend.
-Get over there. -I got them.
You got these guys?
You boys doing a bit of drinking tonight?
-No, officer. Not at all. Not-- We-- -We found those.
I don't believe you.
Freeze. Stand right there.
-We're telling the truth. -Keep it going.
-Don't be a hero tonight, guys. -Wrong night for that.
Yeah, do what you have to do.
Spread your shit!
Get on the ground! Loaded gun, ready to go!
Spread your shit! Pussies on the pavement, fellas.
-Come on! -Please don't shoot, sir.
"Please don't shoot." Shut up and spread your shit!
I am the law! Okay?
Now hold hands.
-What? -Why?
You don't want an asshole where your face used to be, Whaling Jennings.
-Hold his fucking hand! -Fucking hold my hand.
There. That's not so hard, is it?
Here, McLovin, have a cigarette.
Smoke up. Life's short, you know.
Suck it in, my friend.
Suck it long and deep.
Enjoy it.
McLovin, McLovin, McLovin.
-You like Officer Slater and myself? -Yeah, you guys are awesome.
Thanks. We really like you too, McLovin.
So here's what's about to happen.
We're gonna arrest these guys... ...you're gonna write a witness report saying they leapt in front of our car...
...you're gonna write a witness report saying they leapt in front of our car...
...and there was nothing we could do. Sound cool?
-Yeah, that's fine. -Good.
That's good. Pretend he's your little sister.
Your little sister with the....
What the fuck?
Fagell?
-Shit! -Shit!
Run! Run!
Wait.
Hold on, I gotta get all the booze. Seth, wait up!
McLovin bailed!
Chase the kid!
Stop!
That was a fast kid.
I want a ride! You hear me? You can't unarrest me!
Stop!
-McLovin! -Come on.
McLovin!
McLovin! Why?
McLovin, come back!
My hand! Monster! Nicole! Nicole, get Daddy.
-Get Daddy. -Get Daddy!
-Oh, shit. -Get away from my kids!
You sick sons of bitches!
What the fuck?
Michaels, are you okay?
-It's just beer. -Give me a break.
-It's just beer. -Man up.
What happened? What, did you lose him?
He's a freak. He's the fastest kid alive.
-This is not good. -He's the fastest kid alive.
Fastest kid alive, my ass. Come on. What are we gonna do?
I'll shoot my gun in the air.
Give me a fucking warning before you do it.
I'll scare him out of wherever he's hiding.
This isn't gonna do shit. Get in the car. Get in the car.
This is your fault, you piece of--
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. They shot Seth.
They fucking shot Seth, I know it.
Holy shit.
Holy shit. Holy shit.
-Should I run? -Yes.
-Fuck. Stop! -Stop the bus!
-Stop it! -It's stopping.
-It's stopping. -Oh, thank God.
Hey, Evan, pay for me, please.
That's me and him.
Hey, hey. It's you.
McMuffin.
-You know this guy? -It's--
Ain't got no cop people to help you keep your booze now, do you?
Hey! Back the fuck up, man, or I'll beat the shit out of you.
-Give me the booze. -Hey! Back the fuck up.
Back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.
Please, please, calm down, sir.
Goldslick.
Get off the bus or I'm calling the cops.
Eat shit, bum.
Oh, shit, guys. We're three blocks away, man. We made it. We made it with the booze and everything.
We made it. We made it with the booze and everything.
We made it.
Hold this.
I can't believe you still have the liquor.
That's awesome.
Yeah, I told you the idea would work. I fooled those cops.
I'm McLovin. I am McLovin.
Why do you guys have detergent?
I don't understand why you were smoking cigarettes with those cops.
Because I fucking rule.
-We are so gonna get laid tonight. -I am. I'm gonna get laid.
We're finally gonna get our drinks on.
I can't believe Becca's bottle broke.
-I'm sure it'll be fine. -Yeah.
I thought you didn't need it. You were gonna tell her how you feel.
Good luck getting Jules drunk enough to have sex with you.
-What's wrong with you guys? -Nothing.
You two femmes can talk about it next year at your little slumber party.
Oh, you told him.
-Told me what? -Yeah. You're an idiot, Fogell.
-Well, we gotta tell him now. -No, we--
Well, he knows something's up.
What are you guys talking about? Tell me now.
Seth, me and Evan are rooming together next year.
What's the big deal?
"Oh, my God, Fogell's rooming with Evan."
Jeez, why don't you go cry about it?
-I didn't tell you because-- -You're a backstabber...
...and you lied to your best friend and you just don't care anymore?
I didn't expect this from you, Evan.
Not from you.
Give me that booze, Fagell.
We never should have had to hide our arrangement.
-Seth's here. -Seth, you're here.
Hi. Everybody, Seth has got it.
-Evan. -Gaby, hey.
Where have you been? You almost blew it.
-What are you talking about? -Becca. She's been waiting.
She's over there.
She's way smashed.
And she's been yammering about you all night.
Really? What was she saying?
She told you that she thinks I'm a good guy?
No, no. She said something more like:
"I will fully blow him tonight."
-What? -I know.
-Yeah. -But she's totally hammered...
...and if I get with her and I'm not drunk, isn't that unethical?
Not if you're drunk too.
I guess not.
To Seth.
-To Seth! -All right.
Who the fuck is Seth?
I'm Seth!
Let's do another one to me.
Oh, boy.
Calm down. Calm down, man.
Calm down. She likes you.
She wants to suck on your penis.
It's a good thing.
It's the best thing.
Just down the hatch.
Fogell. What's up?
Evan, hey. Evie, come here. Can you please help me up?
I fell down and none of these assholes will help me up.
-Shit. -Becca.
I have been waiting for you for, like, ever.
-What took you so long? -I know, it--
-Do you have my Goldslick? -No, I can't even--
It's such a crazy story, okay? -I swear I was try-- -It doesn't even matter.
-I swear I was try-- -It doesn't even matter.
Look. Look what we-- We can just drink this.
-Here. You could have a drink. -Oh, no.
-I'm already pretty wasted. -Take a drink.
Okay, here's to you. This is to Becca.
To Becca.
-To the respecting-- -Guys.
--women. To people respecting women.
Okay. Yeah.
You're a lightweight.
Hey.
You and me, we should go upstairs, because--
Because I need to tell you something. Okay?
You could just tell me here, I mean....
I can't tell you, because it's a secret for you from me.
-All right. -So come. Come on. Okay.
-Bye, guys. -Bye.
-Bye-bye. -Bye.
You changed your name to McLovin?
-That's so cool. -Thanks.
So, like, what's Hawaii like?
All right. I am back.
I had to thank the peeps for coming out, you know.
Jules. I want you to have a drink with me.
Just drink some of this. You're gonna love it.
You're to-- I know you're gonna love it.
-You know, I-- -It's green beer. For your information.
You know, I'm actually good right now. But thank you.
And thank you very much for bringing everything, again.
Seriously, it really made the night.
No, that's how I roll. That's the thing.
It's no problems. You'll learn that.
I love talking and conversing with you.
But I can't hear you, though, because the music is so loud.
So do you wanna go outside and talk more?
Yeah. Sorry, sure. You know, why not?
Let's do it. I haven't conversed in ages.
-Okay. Ladies-- Ladies first. -Okay.
-Thank you very much. -No problem.
-Watch your step. I fell earlier today. -You serious?
Well, I was hit by a car. It's a long story.
-Oh, shit. Careful. -Okay, well....
So loud. Don't let the parents hear.
You look so pretty.
-Are you okay? -I so flirt with you in math.
Tell me about it. I-- Samesies.
I've wanted to tell you for so long that you're the best girl.
I know. I've wanted to get with you, like, so hard.
Like so hard.
You're the best.
We'll take this sweater off. I think so.
Just be careful, because it's a meaningful sweater to me. It's vintage.
Okay.
-Bought it at that vintage market. -Just hurry.
-And this one. -It's off.
Hey, wait, careful.
-Oh, shit. -Oh, my.
Put that there.
-Now, looky, looky... -Okay.
-...what I got for you under here. -Oh, my gosh.
You are the prettiest girl...
-...this side of the Mississippi. -I have a little something...
...for you under here.
You look so pretty.
-Look so pretty. -Under there.
Hello.
For you.
You're the best. You're so unique.
Come here.
Evan, kiss me.
I like you so much.
Come on, McLovin.
I've never been with an older guy before.
Well, it's way better.
I know, we made some kick-ass tiramisu earlier.
It was deli-- It looked weird. But it was delicious.
What--? What's wrong?
I-- I would prefer if we would just do that... ...at some other time.
...at some other time.
No. There is no other time. School is up.
No. There is no other time. School is up. -What's wrong with right now? -Well, I mean, you're-- You're drunk.
-What's wrong with right now? -Well, I mean, you're-- You're drunk.
-You're, like, really, really drunk. -So? You're drunk. You're drunk, Jules.
Yeah, I'm actually-- I'm not drunk at all.
I don't even drink, so it's.... I mean....
Jules, you drink. You drink.
Everybody-- You-- You had me get liquor, so you drink.
It's like....
Well, yeah, because I'm throwing a party, remember?
Other people drink and so I just....
You...?
You don't wanna, you know?
Not right now.
You know, not while you're drunk.
But, you know, thank you.
-Evan. Evan, I'm so wet. -Oh, yeah.
They said that would happen in health, when I learned about it.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-They taught me about-- -Who's down there?
-They taught me about-- -Who's down there? Yeah, it's your hand.
-Thank you, that's good. -You have such a smooth cock.
Thank you. You would too if you were a man.
But you got such a smooth chest.
I am gonna give you...
...the best blow-J ever...
...with my mouth.
Why don't we--? Why don't we just kiss a while?
Why don't we keep kissing for a bit, instead of...?
How badly do you wanna fuck me?
Jesus Christ.
Jesus, fuck.
-Hang on one second. -What?
Becca, I don't think you wanna do this.
-You're really drunk. -No, I'm not. I am not drunk.
-I see that you are. I think you are. -And I really-- I want you inside me.
I want you to be my first. I want you inside me.
So just-- Just go with it.
-Let it happen. -I know, but....
Becca, this is kind of intense.
And I just-- I'm so drunk. I can't even, like, process this.
And you're really pretty. And I just think this isn't how I pictured it.
And I just think this isn't how I pictured it.
I don't understand why you have to be such a little bitch about it.
-Did you just call me a bitch? -Yes, a scared--
See, I, like, I think we're not thinking clear--
Holy shit. Oh, my God.
-Go get Gaby. -I'll go get her.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Go get Gaby, please.
-I got a boner. -Good.
-Do you have a condom? -Yes.
And lube.
Seth?
Are--? Are you crying?
No, I just have something in both my eyes.
I don't cry. That's funny.
You look-- You look-- It looks like you're crying.
So....
It was my last chance and I fucked it up, and--
Your last chance to do what?
To make you my girlfriend for the summer.
You're, like, the coolest person that's ever talked to me.
I thought we'd both be drunk.
What does me being drunk have anything to do with it?
You'd never get with me if you were sober.
Look at you.
-Look at me. -Seth, come on, you didn't blow it.
I think maybe--
What the fuck?!
Help me.
Shirley.
I'm sorry.
-Someone forgot to call pest control. -Yep.
Where you going? Hey, party's still on.
-Where are you going? -No.
If you're back there, get out. Everyone, come on.
-We will shoot you. -Party's over.
-Evan. -Get the hell out of here.
Keep your hands up.
Life's bullshit, Miroki.
Ev, wake the fuck up, man.
We gotta go. Those fucking cops are here, man.
"Oh, no, it's the cops." We have a complaint.
-Evan, come on. -Get the hell out of here right now.
Get out of here. She's not interested.
-Drop the crantini and move it, sister. -See you, sugar tits.
-Drop the crantini and move it, sister. -See you, sugar tits. Guys, come on, move.
Everybody out. Leave the booze and go.
What the fuck, man?
What the fuck, Seth?
He's my best friend. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Come on.
I assume you all have guns and crack.
Oh, my God, come on. Don't stop.
Okay, everyone...
...prepare to be fucked by the long dick of the law.
Get out.
Come on, go.
Fuck off, Seth.
Get a room.
I'm gonna save you. I'm gonna save you, Evan.
Fuck.
Fuck. Fuck, man, so heavy.
It's in. Oh, my God, it's in.
All right, everybody out. Come on, let's go.
McLovin! What the fuck?
-Officer Slater, is that you? -You ran away from us.
Why did you run away? Michaels, get up here.
-No. I didn't run away. -What the fuck?
Why would you do that?
-I was disoriented from-- -Were you violating that girl?
You just violated her with your penis? Michaels, look.
-McLovin? -No, no, no.
No.
Holy shit. Were you just getting laid?
No. Yeah, I was, but--
-Yes, yes, he was. -It's not what you think, guys.
-I'm not even-- -Sit the fuck down. Stay down.
-Calm down. -I thought we were friends...
...and then you go running away.
Contain yourself.
-We're friends. -Shut up.
-Calm down. Calm down, man. -Why? What?
You just cock-blocked McLovin. Okay? He's our friend. We don't do that.
We should be guiding his cock, not blocking it.
Just relax, okay? Let's make this right.
Wait, what are you--? What are you guys doing?
No, please, I can't-- I can't go to jail. Please, I can't go to jail.
No, look. We're really sorry, McLovin.
This has-- This has gone on-- This has gone way too far.
What? What are you talking about?
We know you're not 25, man. We're not idiots, McLovin.
-Yeah. -Did you know the whole time?
Look, when we were your age, we hated cops.
When we saw you in the liquor store today, we just....
I guess we saw a bit of ourselves, you know... ...and we just wanted to show you that...
...and we just wanted to show you that... ...you know, cops can have a fun time too, you know?
...you know, cops can have a fun time too, you know?
Yeah.
You know, in a way, I think we wanted to show ourselves.
Also, I'm....
I'm really sorry that I blocked your cock.
-Apology accepted. -Seriously, man.
That feels good.
-It feels so good. -I missed you guys.
I just wish we could make it up to you somehow, man.
Well, do you think you can do me a really big favor?
-What is it? Anything. -Name it.
-This kid's fucking crazy. -Stay back for your own safety.
Get off me, you fucking cops. Get your hands off.
Do you know who I am? I'm Fogell.
-The joint can't hold me. -Holy shit, Fogell's a badass.
I'm gonna break your glasses, you fucking cop. You can't hold me.
Fucking pigs.
Oh, shit.
Nice mullet, asshole.
-You crazy. -This kid's crazy.
He's nuts. Well, we caught the infamous Fogell.
Get your hands-- Wait for me, Nicola. Wait for me on the outside.
We were gonna go to Hawaii.
Man, that's gonna get you so much ass.
Seriously?
-I know what to do about the car. -Sweet.
Fucking go. Fucking throw up.
Are you carrying me?
No, I'm saving you from the cops.
You saved me?
Well, I don't know what you're talking about, but thanks.
Can I-- Should I just walk?
-Should I walk? -Yeah, sure.
-Okay. -Where do you wanna go?
Sleepover at my house? You wanna come sleep...?
-Okay. -Okay.
Does your mom still have pizza bagels?
Yeah. Lots.
Pizza bagels.
So by signing this, you are officially saying...
...that as we stopped you from being mugged...
...a crackhead stole our cruiser and did God knows what with it.
-You cool to sign that? -Of course. I owe you guys my life.
We owe you, Mc-- Wait, what's your real name again?
We owe you, Mc-- Wait, what's your real name again? -Fogell. -Fuck that.
-We're calling you McLovin. -McLovin.
Let's do this dance, boys.
-Oh, my God. -What did I tell you guys, right?
That was crazy.
All right.
All right, now, guys, check this out.
It's probably the greatest move in doughnut-spinning history.
You paying attention?
Behold, the upward-spiraling pigtail.
-Why is it called that? -I don't know.
Make the badge proud, Slater.
He's not usually this drunk when he does this...
...but I think that could make it more cool.
McLovin!
Oh, no.
Fuck.
-Slater! -Officer Slater.
All right. Fucking crazy.
Let's do this.
-Hurry, hurry. Let's go. Go, go. -I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
-I'm out, I'm out. -Good, here we go, here we go.
Yeah? Yeah, okay. Back up.
Don't blow yourself up, asshole.
Yes. Oh, my God.
It worked. It worked.
We won. We won.
Can we shoot at it?
I don't know. Can you?
Break yourself, fool.
Tight.
Listen, and then she said she was gonna give me a blow-J.
-I can't believe she said that to you. -Man, you have no idea.
-What was she thinking? -You don't even know.
I gotta tell you. I gotta tell you something, Evan.
What?
I was in your room, like, three weeks ago... ...while you were taking a shit.
And I saw your housing, like, forms.
So I knew you and Fogell were gonna live together, you know.
I'm sorry, man, I don't know.
I should've told you. I don't know why I didn't.
Don't-- No, don't be sorry. I should be sorry.
I was being a dick. I was being a big dick to you.
No, I--
Listen, Seth, I want you to know, I don't wanna live with Fogell.
I never wanted to live with him. I just don't-- I ha--
I'm afraid to live with strangers.
I can't.
I can't do it.
I know, I know.
I can't believe you saved me.
You saved me.
I can't believe. I owe you so--
You carried me. I love you.
I love you, man.
I love you.
I love you. I'm not even embarrassed to say it. I just--
I lo-- I love you.
-I'm not embarrassed. -I love you.
I love you.
Why don't we say that every day? Why can't we say it more often?
I just love you. I just wanna go to the rooftops and scream:
"I love my best friend, Evan."
-We should go up on my roof. -For sure.
Like, when you went away for Easter, on your vacation, I missed you.
-I missed you too. -I want the world to know.
It's-- It's the most beautiful thing in the world.
Come here. Come here, man.
-I love you. -I love you.
What the fuck?
-What up? -Morning. Morning.
I should get moving. I should get moving.
I should be getting a move on, for sure.
Yeah, you don't-- I mean, you don't have to, you know.
I don't really have anything going on.
You don't have to rush off like that.
You wanna hang out?
I was gonna go to the mall.
I have to get a new comforter.
For college. The mall, they would sell that.
Cool. So...
...your mom's got huge tits.
What do you think?
I don't know, man. Don't ask me.
Because I don't give a shit how pants look.
Yeah, I need someone's opinion.
Those are too tight. Those are way too tight.
-Yeah, but, like-- -Way too tight. You need to upgrade.
But when I was wearing your dad's pants...
...I realized that if I wear pants that are a little too small...
...it might encourage me to lose weight.
And also, chicks can kind of see, like...
...you know, the borders and outline of my dick a little.
Yeah, man, they go nuts for that. The male camel toe.
Yeah, the camel tail. It's right--
I know where it is, where it happens.
Like, right there.
It's like they're so tight that one ball is, like, above my dick, even.
-Yeah, exactly. -It's like three.
It's like a three thing. It's like ball, dick, ball.
It's like a division sign.
Like a bunch of people crammed into a van.
You know, I just wish you would take these off.
You're right, these look stupid. Let's get the fuck out of here.
I'm really sorry about that. I can't believe I actually did that.
I feel bad that I'm making you buy me a new one.
It's seems, like, ridiculous.
-No. I have to, it's puke. It's gross. -Oh, my God.
Do alcoholics get hangovers?
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit. It's them.
-What the fuck do we do, man? -Don't stop. I don't know.
-Hey. -Hey.
How's it going?
It's so good to-- How are you feeling?
I've felt better. But I'll be fine. How about you?
I'm okay, you know, yeah. Did you have fun last night?
You know, I actually don't remember much.
I don't remember anything.
-So weird. -Nothing.
I didn't puke on you, did I?
You didn't. I remember that you-- I avoided it.
It whizzed right by me, and I said, "Stay away from me," you know.
I'm really sorry about everything last night, and I just....
Thank you for being such a nice guy about it all.
That's okay, you know.
At least you don't have a black eye from it.
-That looks terrible. -Yeah.
You look great. You don't look terrible. It's just, like, a bad bruise.
Everything's great, just from he-- This, just like right there.
-Your eye. -Yeah, your eye.
Everything else is great.
But seriously, I acted like a fucking idiot last night.
You don't deserve that. So I'm sorry.
On the upside, I think you look cool with a black eye.
I'm just gonna throw that out there. I don't-- I don't know.
Well, thank you, smart guy. Thanks. That's actually why I'm here.
Because I have to get a ton of cover-up for the grad photo.
Oh, man. Fuck.
And I'm gonna get Jules a new comforter.
I have to get a comforter too. For college.
-Oh, yeah? -Yeah, I just figured I would need one.
So, Seth....
So do you wanna come buy me cover-up or something?
I mean, you kind of owe me.
Yeah, definitely. I would love to do that.
I had such bad acne last year...
...that I pretty much became, like, an expert on the stuff.
Well, you drove. Evan drove me here, though, so....
Well, so-- Well, I mean, I have my dad's car.
So I could just give you a lift...
...and then Evan could take Becca home.
If that works. I don't know if it's in your route.
It'd be fine with me.
Fine, yeah. Maybe we can get some food.
Yeah, I'd like that.
So I guess I'll call you, then. Yeah, give me a call. Yeah, you have my number.
Yeah, give me a call. Yeah, you have my number.
I have your information. So put her there.
Perfect. Good. All right, man.
-Okay. -Okay, guys.
-Becca. -Bye, guys.
-Bye, have fun. -See you, Jules.
Yeah, that's funny. Too funny.
Where do you wanna go to eat?
I'm gonna fuck her.
We know not where it comes from,
only that it holds the power to create worlds and fill them with life.
That is how our race was born.
For a time, we lived in harmony,
but like all great power, some wanted it for good, others for evil.
And so began the war,
a war that ravaged our planet until it was consumed by death,
and the Cube was lost to the far reaches of space.
We scattered across the galaxy, hoping to find it and rebuild our home,
searching every star, every world.
And just when all hope seemed lost, message of a new discovery drew us
to an unknown planet called Earth.
But we were already too late.
Oh, God, five months of this.
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.
A plate of mama's alligators  etouffee.
You've been talking about barbecued 'gators and crickets

But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known to have the most succulent meat.
I understand.

I mean, how many times have we... We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.
Why you got to ruin it for me, man? That's my heritage. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

Squawk ident and proceed east out of the area.

Copy the bogie.

Sir, says here 4500 X was shot down three months ago.

Check again, then recheck. I did, sir.
A friend of mine was on that chopper.
PILOT: Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you to US SOCCENT airbase.
SHARP: Radar, where's the inbound? SOLDIER: Bogie's five miles out, sir.
My wife on? SOLDIER: Yes, Captain.
(EXCLAIMING) My ladies! Look.
Oh, my goodness. Look at her. She's getting so big.
Look at those cheeks. I just wanna chew on them.
Baby, we made a good-looking kid.
I know that people say that all the time,
but, wow, we made one good-looking kid. Nice work.
She has your laugh.
(BABY GURGLING) She laughed? Her first one, yeah.
You sure she didn't just fart?
No, she's a lady.
(CRYING) She doesn't know you yet, but she will.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.

Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me, I love you and I'll be home soon.

Oh, my God. Okay.
No!
(SCREAMS)
What the...
Epps, let's go!
HOSNEY: Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.
SAM: Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.
(WHISPERING) Watch.
Okay.
For my family...
(STUDENTS LAUGHING) Who did... Who did that? People! Responsibility.
Okay.
So, for my family genealogy report,
I decided to do it on my great-great-grandfather,
who was a famous man, Captain Archibald Witwicky.
Very famous explorer.
In fact, he was one of the first to explore the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.
to explore the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.
In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors straight into the Arctic Shelf.
SAILOR: Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!
The ice is freezing faster than it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!
Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!
So that's the story, right?
And here we have some of the basic instruments and tools
used by 19th-century seamen.
(ALL LAUGHING)
This here is the quadrant, which you can get for 80 bucks.
It's all for sale, by the way.
(STUDENTS CHUCKLING) Like the sextant here. $50 for this, which is a bargain.
These are pretty cool. These are my grandfather's glasses.
I haven't quite gotten them appraised yet, but they've seen many cool things.
HOSNEY: Are you going to sell me his liver?
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell. It's the 11th grade.
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell. It's the 11th grade. I don't think your grandfather would be
particularly proud of what you're doing.
particularly proud of what you're doing. I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know, this is all going towards my car fund.
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay. I take PayPal.
Cold hard cash works, too.
And the compass makes a great gift for Columbus Day.
HOSNEY: Sam! Sorry.
Unfortunately, my great-great-grandfather,
the genius that he was, wound up going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,
drawing these strange symbols
and babbling on about some giant ice man
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING) that he thought he'd discovered.
HOSNEY: Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow. Might not.
Sleep in fear tonight. Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?
Sam? Yeah. Sorry, sorry.
Okay. Pretty good, right?
I'd say a solid B-.
A B-?
You were hawking your great-grandfather's crap
in my classroom. No, kids enjoy...
Look, can you do me a favor? What?
Can you look out the window for a second? You see my father?
He's the guy in the green car. Yeah.
Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream. A boy's dream.
And a man's promise to that boy.
He looked at me in the eye. He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.
"But I want you to bring me $2,000 and three As."
Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As.
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-. Pfft! Dream gone. Kaput.
Sir, just ask yourself, what would Jesus do?
Yes! Yes, yes.
So?
A-. It's an A, though.
A-. It's an A, though. Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.

What's wrong with you? You think I'd really get you
a Porsche for your first car?
I don't want to talk to you for the rest of this whole thing.
(LAUGHING) Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke. It's not a funny joke.
Manny! What?
Get your cousin out of that damn clown suit.
He's having a heat stroke again.

Sam. Sam, let me talk to you.
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom awaits underneath one of those hoods.
Let me tell you something, son. (ENGINE REVVING) A driver don't pick the car.
The car'll pick the driver.
It's a mystical bond between man and machine.
Son, I'm a lot of things, but a liar's not one of them.

Oh, don't be like that. If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.

Well, over here, every piece of car a man might want or need.
This ain't bad.
This one's got racing stripes. Yeah.
It got racing...
Yeah, what's this? What the heck is this?
I don't know nothing about this car.
Manny! What?
What is this? This car! Check it out!
I don't know, boss! I've never seen it! That's  loco!
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny! Find out!
Feels good.
RON: How much? (GROANS) Well,
considering the semi-classic nature of the vehicle,
with the slick wheels and the custom paint job...
SAM: Yeah, but the paint's faded. Yeah, but it's custom.
It's custom faded?
It's custom faded? Well, this is your first car. I wouldn't expect you to understand.
Five grand. No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.
No, no, no. You said cars pick their drivers.
Well, sometimes they pick a driver with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.
Now, this one here for four Gs is a beaut.
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes over there.
No, I don't want a Fiesta with racing stripes.
This is a classic engine right here.
I sold a car the other day...
Gee. Holy cow.
No, no, no. No worries. You all right?
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!
Get your clown cousin and get some hammers

Hello, Mr. Secretary.
They're so young.
AIDE: They're the top subject matter experts, sir.
NSA's recruiting right out of high school these days.
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.
I am so underdressed.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Secretary of Defense.
Please be seated.
I'm John Keller.
Obviously, you're wondering why you're here, so these are the facts.
At 1900 local time yesterday,
the SOCCENT Forward Operations Base in Qatar was attacked.
So far as we know, there were no survivors.
The objective of the attack was to hack our military network.
We're not sure exactly what they're after,
but we do know that they were cut off during the assault,
which would lead us to assume that they're going to try it again.
Now, no one's taken responsibility for the attack.
And the only real lead we have so far is this sound.
That's the signal that hacked our network.
NSA's working at full capacity to analyze it
and intercept further communications,
but we need your help to find out who did this.
Now, you've all shown considerable ability in the area of signals analysis.
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.
The President has dispatched battle groups
to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea. This is as real as it's ever gonna get.
Now I'm gonna leave you to your officer-in-charge.
You'll break up into teams and you'll start your work.
Good luck to us all.
All right, Mojo. I got the car. Now I need the girl.
I need money to take out the girl is what I need.
Zero bids.
(SIGHS) Great. Broke.
(SNARLING) Come on, Mojo. You want your pain pills?
No. Premature.
Good. What's up?
Nothing. You know, just driving my car. Driving my car.
It's like clockwork.
All right, I know you get wasted on these things,
but if you piss in my bed again, you're sleeping outside. Okay?
but if you piss in my bed again, you're sleeping outside. Okay? That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.
Ron, this one is uneven. Yeah. Probably.
This one is wobbly.
Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon. (LAUGHS) Couldn't we have hired a professional?
Sam... What?
I do not like footprints on my grass.
What foot... There's no footprints. That's why I built my path.
So why don't you go from my grass onto my path, okay?
It's family grass, Dad. Well, when you own your own grass,
you'll understand. This... I can't do it anymore.
What? You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
He's got enough self-esteem issues as a Chihuahua, Mom.
JUDY: That's his bling.
I want you home at 11:00!
Yeah, all right. 11:00!
JUDY: Please, for the love of God, drive safely.
Seat belt on!
Wow. You are so cheap.
Well, it's his first car. Supposed to be like that.
KELLER ON TV: At this time, we can't confirm whether there were any survivors.
Oh, my God.
Our bases worldwide are, as of now, at DEFCON Delta,
our highest readiness level.
We're dealing with a very effective weapons system that we have not come across before.
that we have not come across before.
But our prayers are with the families of the brave men and women... (CRYING) Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.
(CRYING) Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.
EPPS: I've never seen a weapons system like this.
The thermal shows this weird aura around the exoskeleton
like it's cloaked by some kind of invisible force field.
That's impossible. There's no such thing as invisible force fields
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?
FIG: Man, I don't know. What is that?
My mama, she had the gift, you know?
She saw things. I got the gene, too,
and that thing that attacked us? I got a feeling it ain't over.
DONNELY: How about you use those magic voodoo powers
and get us the hell out of here, huh?
When I took that picture, I think it saw me.
It looked right at me.
All right, we got to get this thing back to the Pentagon right away.
They got to know what we're dealing with here.
EPPS: My radio's fried.
I got no communication with aerial. LENNOX: Hey, Mahfouz.
How far do you live from here? Not far. Just up that mountain.
Do they have a phone? Yes.

You tried out for the football team last year, right? (GRUNTING)
COACH: Let's go call your mom.
Oh, no, no, that... No. That wasn't like a real tryout.
I was researching a book I was writing.
Oh, yeah? Yeah.
Yeah? What's it about? Sucking at sports? (CHUCKLES)
No, it's about the link between brain damage and football.
No, it's a good book. Your friends'll love it.
You know, it's got mazes in it and, you know, little coloring areas,
sections, pop-up pictures. It's a lot of fun.
That's funny.
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

You got to get out of the tree right now. Get...
Just get out of the tree right now, please.

which is what they tried to do in Qatar, only this time it worked.
What did they get? We still don't know.
Talk to me about the virus. It's a Spider-bot virus.
We're not sure what it's going to do, but it may cripple the system.
KELLER: Can we stop it? Every time we try an antivirus,
it adapts and speeds up. It's like it's not a virus anymore.
It's become the system.
BRIGHAM: Obviously the first phase of a major attack against the US.
The only countries with this kind of capability
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.
I'm sorry, that's not correct. Excuse me, young lady.
I didn't see you standing there. You would be who?
I'm just the analyst who detected the hack.
Hold on. It was you? You did it?
Her team. Sir, I was just trying to say,
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.
Okay. Even a supercomputer with a brute force attack
would take 20 years to do that.
Maybe you can explain, then, how our latest satellite imagery
shows North Korea doubling its naval activity.
Maybe it's a precaution, because isn't that what we're doing?
The signal pattern is learning. It's evolving on its own.
And you need to move past Fourier transfers
and start considering quantum mechanics.
There is nothing on Earth that complex.
What about an organism? A living organism?
Maybe some kind of DNA-based computer?
And I know that that sounds crazy... That's enough. That's enough.
We have six floors of analysts working on this thing.
Now, if you can find proof to back up your theory,
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you. But if you don't get a filter
But if you don't get a filter on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna be off the team. You understand?
Look, I can't be any clearer than how crystal clear I am being.
It just stood up. It just stood up.
Wow. That's really neat.
Okay, chiefie.
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.
What are you rolling?
Whippets? Goofballs? A little wowie sauce with the boys?
No, I'm not on any drugs. What's these?
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."
Is that what the kids are doing now? Little bit of Mojo?
Those are my dog's pain pills. You know, a Chihuahua. A little...
What was that?
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?
You wanna go? Make something happen. Do it.
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.
Are you on drugs?
Let's hope this telephone line works.
FIG: Hey, heads up!
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!
What the heck was that?
English, dude. English.
Whoa!
Watch out!
Open fire! Contact! Contact!
LENNOX: Everybody, quiet. Settle.

EPPS: Fire!
This is an emergency Pentagon call! I need you to... Do you understand?
It's an emergency Pentagon...
I don't have a credit card!
Sir, the attitude is not going to speed things up any bit at all.
I'm going to ask you to speak into the mouthpiece very clearly.
I'm in the middle of a war! This is frigging ridiculous!
Ammo!
I need a credit card!
Epps! Where's your wallet? Pocket!
Which pocket? My back pocket!
You got 10 back pockets! Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!
LENNOX: All right, keep shooting! Keep shooting!
Okay, it's Visa.
Also, sir, have you heard about
our premium plus world-service gold package?
No, I don't want a premium package! Epps! Pentagon!
Give me a status.
Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team under fire in Qatar.
They say they're survivors of the base attack.
Survivors?
I ain't never seen this in my life!
Need gunships on station ASAP!
SERGEANT: Predator's coming up in a minute.
We're linking the call to the nearest AWACS.
Unknown, man. I don't... Man, if you seen this shit...
Predator ETA two minutes.
Hey! Make way!
What is that? I don't know.
We need air support and we need it now.
Roll in strike package Bravo on unknown target.
I authenticate Tango Whiskey at time 0300 Zulu.
MAN 1: Attention, all aircraft. This will be a danger close-fire mission.
MAN 2: Weapons, I just got a call from Falcon Ops.
Who's closer to Kill Box One Alpha?
Send the Hogs, sir. Okay, send the Hogs over
to Kill Box One Alpha. It's a danger close...
MAN 3: Switch the Hogs to Kill Box One Alpha, 300 feet danger close.
PILOT: Friendlies in the area.
Seven-man team north of orange smoke!
Received Kill Box One Alpha. Engage hostile.
Attack direction west! You're clear and hot!
Strike, tell me status of Hog right now.
Hog One-One Dark Star status.
Lennox! The heat's coming! Laze the target!
We got a beam-rider incoming! Laze target!
Ready! Heat's coming! What? Bring it!
PILOT: Receiving radar jamming in vicinity of target.
LENNOX: No frigging way that thing's still not down.
Spooky Three Two, use 105 shells. Bring the rain.
PILOT: Be advised, ground team is requesting 105 sabot rounds.
Did we lose them?
SERGEANT: Warthog One confirm visual on friendlies.
LENNOX: Where's Fig?
Fig? Fig? FIG: Oh, God!
God damn it! Get a medic!
Get a medic!
FIG: I'm sorry. EPPS: Black Hawk...
FIG: I'm sorry. EPPS: Black Hawk... We'll get a medic. Just hold on. He's got a pulse.
We'll get a medic. Just hold on. He's got a pulse. EPPS: We need a medevac. One man down. Patient care category urgent.
Bring them home.
You get those men stateside right now.
I want them debriefed in 10 hours.
MAGGIE: There's only one hacker in the world who can break this code.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Stop!
I am sorry to bother you.
Maggie? Listen, I need your help.
No! This is my private area, my place of Zen and peace.
Listen to me. GRANDMA: Glen! Who is it?
Shut up, Grandma!
What are you doing here? Just give me a break, will you, please?
(GRANDMA SHOUTING) Grandmama! Drink your prune juice!
Oh! What level are you on, man? Six.
Oh, here come the matrix! Here come the matrix! (BOTH EXCLAIMING)
Glen, seriously, don't you want to see something classified?
Yeah. Get low.
Here we go. Here we go. Double tap. Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.
Hey. I need a moment.
Please. MAGGIE: Sorry.
Hey, man, save my game.
How classified?
Like "I will go to jail for the rest of my life for showing you" classified.
Yes! One quick peek.
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot of whatever hit the base in Qatar.
I want to see it. Well, the imager was damaged, sir.
The rangers are en route with the imager,
but we also have a security issue.
Circle logs indicate one of the analysts made a copy
of the network intrusion signal.
The signal strength is through the roof. Where did you say you got this?
It hacked the national military air-guard frequency
in less than a minute.
No way. Yeah.
Looks like there's a message embedded in the signal. Let me work my magic.
"Project Iceman"?
What's Sector Seven? Who is Captain Witwicky?
(SHUSHING) Are you playing those video games again?
Cops! Cops!
FBI! Clear right!
(SCREAMING) AGENT: Lock it down! Lock it down!
OMAR: Cops!
Lock it down.
Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a...
Get off my Grandmama's carpet! She don't like nobody on the carpet!
Especially police!
REPORTER ON TV: It was an awesome spectacle here an hour ago
when over 40 C-17s lifted off of this very base.
We're not told where they're going.
Morning, Mo.
Morning, Mo. The government has been very quiet about what's going on but in our...
Mojo. Mojo. They were headed directly
(BARKS) towards North Korea.
Stop with the barking, Mojo. It's too early. Please?
Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.
My car, it stole itself, okay? What are you talking about, man?
Satan's Camaro. In my yard. It's stalking me.
Stop!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
(SHOUTING) GIRL: Oh, my God!
(GROANING) Sam?
Hi.
That was... That was really awesome.
(GROANING) Well, it felt awesome. Are you okay?
I'm not okay, all right? I'm losing my mind a little bit.
I'm getting chased by my car right now. I got to go.
You know what? I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.
Oh, great. Cops.
Officer!
Listen!
Oh, that hurt.
Listen to me!
Thank God you're here! I've had the worst day ever!
I've been... I've been followed here on my mother's bike! Right?
And my car's right there and it's been following me here!
So get out of the car! (ENGINE ROARING) No! Stop! Oh, God. Okay, okay! Okay, all right!
Okay! I'm sorry! I'm... I didn't mean to hit your car! Look!
Okay, look, look, look! Stop, stop!
Please! Okay, what do you want from me?
Okay.
Oh, God, no! No!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit! Oh, God! Oh, shit!
It's a bad dream.
Are you username LadiesMan217?
I don't know what you're talking about! Are you username LadiesMan217?
Are you username LadiesMan217?
Yeah.
Where is eBay item 21153?
Where are the glasses?
Get back!
Stop!
God!
What is your problem, Sam?
Okay, there's a monster right there! It just attacked me!
Here he comes! All right, get up. Get up and run! You have to run! Okay. (TIRES SCREECHING)
Sam, what is that thing?
You have to get in the car. Get in. I don't want to.
Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me! Sam.
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, God! We're gonna die! We're gonna die!
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.
Oh, my God! Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!
Oh, my God! No!
We're gonna die!
Oh, my God!
We're locked in.
(CAR PASSING) The car won't start. At least we ditched the monster, right?
Okay.
Time to start.
He's got me! Oh, God!
He's going to kill me!
No. No, no, no!
Get off!
Kill it! Kill it!
Get it, get it, get it, get it!
Not so tough without a head, are you?
Here, come on.
MIKAELA: What is it?
It's a robot.
But like a...
Like a different... You know, like a super-advanced robot.
It's probably Japanese.
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.
What are you doing?
I don't think it wants to hurt us. It would have done that already.
Really? Well, do you speak robot?
Because they just had, like, a giant droid death match.
I think it wants something from me. What?
Well, 'cause the other one was talking about my eBay page.
You are the strangest boy I have ever met.
SAM: Can you talk? ANNOUNCER: XM Satellite Radio...
(RADIO CHANNELS SWITCHING) Digital cable brings you... ...Columbia Broadcasting System...
So you... You talk through the radio?
Thank you, you're beautiful. You're wonderful, you're wonderful.
So, what was that last night? What was that?
Message from Starfleet, Captain...
Throughout the inanimate vastness of space...
Angels will rain down like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!
Visitors from heaven? What...
What are you, like, an alien or something?
Any more questions you want to ask?
He wants us to get in the car.
And go where?
Fifty years from now, when you're looking back at your life,
don't you want to be able to say you had the guts to get in the car?
This car's a pretty good driver.
I know.
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?
I'm not going to sit in that seat. He's driving.
Yeah.
You're right.
Well, maybe you should sit in my lap. Why?
Well, I have the only seat belt here. You know, safety first.
Yeah, all right. Right?
Yeah. Okay.
There, see? That's better.
Okay. Okay.
You know, that seat belt thing was a pretty smooth move. (CHUCKLING)
Thank you.
You know what I don't understand?
Why, if he's supposed to be, like, this super-advanced robot,
does he transform back into this piece-of-crap Camaro?
SAM: Whoa! Whoa!
Oh, see? No. Get... No, that doesn't work. See?
MAN: Move it, you moron!
Great, now... See?
Fantastic.
Now you pissed him off.
That car is sensitive.
I mean, $4000 just drove off.
What?
This is you...
Oh, my God!
Come on, let's go.
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen! Explosions everywhere!
This is easily a hundred times cooler than  Armageddon. I swear to God!
Fire, fire, fire, fire!
Whoa! Sweet!
Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got asteroid insurance,
'cause he is so boned!
What is that?
There's something in the tree, dude.
No, there's something in the thing by the tree!
Could you guys just give me a space rock?
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing out here by yourself?
Holy God! What happened to the pool?
Are you Samuel James Witwicky, descendent of Archibald Witwicky?
They know your name.
Yeah.
My name is Optimus Prime.
We are autonomous robotic organisms from the planet Cybertron.
But you can call us Autobots for short. Autobots.
What's cracking, little bitches? OPTIMUS: My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.
JAZZ: This looks like a cool place to kick it.
What is that? How did he learn to talk like that?
We've learned Earth's languages through the World Wide Web.
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.
You feeling lucky, punk? Easy, Ironhide.
Just kidding. I just wanted to show him my cannons.
(SNIFFING) OPTIMUS: Our medical officer, Ratchet.
The boy's pheromone level suggests he wants to mate with the female.
You already know your guardian, Bumblebee.
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING) Bumblebee, right?
BUMBLEBEE: ♪ Check on the rep Yep, second to none ♪
So you're my guardian, huh?
His vocal processors were damaged in battle. I'm still working on them.
Why are you here?
We are here looking for the All Spark. And we must find it before Megatron.
Mega-what?
OPTIMUS: Our planet was once a powerful empire, peaceful and just,
until we were betrayed by Megatron, leader of the Decepticons.
All who defied them were destroyed.
Our war finally consumed the planet, and the All Spark was lost to the stars.
Megatron followed it to Earth, where Captain Witwicky found him.
My grandfather.
It was an accident that intertwined our fates.
Come back!
I think the dogs have found something.
The ice is cracking!
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!
I'm all right, lads!
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?
Megatron crash-landed before he could retrieve the Cube.
Men! We've made a discovery!
He accidentally activated his navigation system.
OPTIMUS: The coordinates to the Cube's location on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.
How'd you know about his glasses?
eBay. eBay.
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,
they will use its power to transform Earth's machines and build a new army.
And the human race will be extinguished.
Sam Witwicky, you hold the key to Earth's survival.
Please tell me that you have those glasses.
It's like a self-regenerating molecular armor.
Look at the scorch mark where the sabot round hit.
Melted right through.
Melted right through. Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like, a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?
Close to it. It melts tank armor.
So this metal skin must react to extreme heat.
Heads up! Oh!
I thought you said that thing was dead, man!
Strap it down! Strap it! This thing is wicked.
All right, get on the horn with Northern Command.
Tell them that our effective weapon is high-heat sabot rounds.
Recommend we load them on all the gunships. Go.
You want that piece?
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break it down to you how it's gonna happen.
They gonna come through that door and be good cop, bad cop.
Don't fall for that, all right? That's why I ate their food.
See, they put the plate of donuts out here to test your guilt.
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.
I ate the whole plate. The whole plate. Okay?
It's me and you.
They walk through that door, you don't say nothing.
She did it! She did it! She's the one you want! All right?
I was just sitting at home watching cartoons,
playing video games with my cousin, and she came in there.
And then... Glen, you freak.
Hey! I am not going to jail for you or anybody else!
I have done nothing bad my entire life! Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.
Okay, so what?
I've downloaded a couple of thousand songs off the Internet.
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?
I promise! Glen, shut up!
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me! Don't talk to me, criminal!
Oh, sugar rush. This is... This is not his fault.
See? So can I go home now?
Oh, okay. I won't. But just listen to me.
Okay, whoever hacked into your military system downloaded a file, all right?
It was something about someone named Witwicky
and some government group, right? Named Sector Seven.
You have to let me talk to Defense Secretary Keller
before you go to war with the wrong country!
Whatever fell out of the sky ended up right behind...
What did he say? What?
What did he say? What? Did he hear it, too? Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.
Did he hear it, too? Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah. What does he think it is? He thinks it's a military experiment.
What a knucklehead. Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.
Still no official word as to what happened. You can see...
Yeah! Call Sam.
Yeah. Why? He should be home in 15 minutes.
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.
If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late and you'll have to ground him. Well, I can't ground him if he's not late, can I?
Well, I can't ground him if he's not late, can I?
I need you to stay here, all right?
I need you to stay here, all right? You got to stay here and you're gonna watch them.
Okay, okay. All of them.
Okay, okay. All of them. Do you hear what I'm saying? Yeah, okay, okay.
Five minutes, all right?
Thanks for staying on my path. Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!
Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey! The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry. I forgot about the path.
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing right now. How about that?
You know, I buy half your car... Yeah.
...then I bail you out of jail and then I just decided to do all your chores.
The chores. Yeah. Life is great, huh?
Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad. I'm gonna do the trash cans now.
No, no, I don't want you to strain yourself.
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.
I'll do it. It would hurt my feelings if you do it.
You sure? I don't mind, I don't... I promise...
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do the trash cans and I'm gonna scrape the grill
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up the whole house right now.
Tonight, right now? Right now.
The... (SHUSHING)
I love you. God, I love you
just so much right now.
You know, Mom wanted me to ground you.
You're three minutes late. Right?
Oh, well, just another thing you did for me, Dad,
because you're such a swell guy.
One more thing, huh?
All right, I love you! Sleep good, handsome man!
What are you doing? What are you doing?
No, watch the path! Watch the path! Watch the... Please, please, please.
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!
OPTIMUS: Oops. Sorry. My bad. Oh, I... You couldn't...
You couldn't wait for five... You couldn't wait for five minutes?
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!
I told you to watch them. I told you. Okay, you know what?
They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
(BARKING) Oh, this is bad. No!
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!
Oh, wet. No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo. This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.
He's a pet. Okay? That's all. If you could just put the guns away...
Put the... Put them away. Please. IRONHIDE: You have a rodent infestation.
A what? Shall I terminate?
No, no, no, no. He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.
This is my... This is my Chihuahua. We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.
He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo! Bad Mojo!
I'm sorry. He's got a male dominance thing. That's all it is.
My foot's gonna rust. All right.
Okay, okay.
Shut up and go hide! Just hurry.
Autobots, recon.
RON: I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.
Got some ice on his nose.
I had to slap him around a little bit.
You did not.
You didn't even ground him. Almost, almost.
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.
Come on, come on.
SAM: What? What is this? OPTIMUS: Time is short.
They really want those glasses. Come on. What are you doing?
I'm gonna help you. Okay.
Please hurry. SAM: Okay.
Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone. What do you mean?
My glasses were in the bag.
My glasses were in the bag. They were in the backpack and now the backpack isn't here.
Well, they're gonna be pissed, so what do you wanna do?
So what I think you should do is you should...
You should check this whole... This whole section here.
Just give it a clean sweep, and I'll get the corner here.
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there. That's my... That's my private...
Sorry. That's nothing. You just...
You just told me to look... I know,
You just told me to look... I know, but I didn't mean to look inside of my treasure chest.
but I didn't mean to look inside of my treasure chest. MIKAELA: You should be way more specific so I don't get in trouble in your room.
I'm already stressed out enough.
SAM: Okay. What now?
No. No, no. No, no, no.
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.
Oh, God. Oh!
Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed right here and now it's gone.
My moped's under there, man! Who's gonna pay for that?
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.
He's back here. I can't deal with this. I can't...
He's back here. I can't deal with this. I can't... What? Oh, no, no, no.
What? Oh, no, no, no.
This is my mother's flower... Oops. Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me. If my parents come out here and see you, they're gonna freak out.
My mother's got a temper, okay?
We must have the glasses.
I know you need the glasses. I've been looking everywhere.
They're not here. They're definitely not here.
Keep searching.
I need you to be quiet for five minutes. Ten minutes. Okay?
Ten minutes. Okay?
Please, I'm begging you. You got to... You're making a racket.
I can't concentrate. You want me to look and I'm hearing... Calm down, calm down.
Calm down, calm down.
You got to do something here. You got to do something here. Autobots, fall back. Thank you. Please, for five minutes.
Autobots, fall back. Thank you. Please, for five minutes. Good? Good? Okay.
Good? Good? Okay.
Move! Get away!
What's the matter with you? Can't you be quiet?
He wants us to be quiet.
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move, move! Earthquake!
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it! Duck and cover right now!
How did you get over there so fast?
Wow! That was tingly!
You got to try that! Yeah, that looks fun.
RON: Sam? JUDY: Sammy?
What the hell is that? I don't know.
Sam? That's weird.
Sam! OPTIMUS: Ratchet, point the light.
Come on, hurry. SAM: Listen, we got a major issue in here.
What's with the light? You gotta stop the light.
What's going on? Turn it off. You gotta tell him to shut it off.
Shut it off. RON: Sam, are you in there?
How come the door's locked?
You know the rules. No doors locked in my house!
You know he'll start counting
You know he'll start counting if you don't open the door! One more chance. Five...
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear. Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal. He's counting!
Sam, just open the door. Three.
Oh, my. Two.
He's counting. Stand back.
What's up? What's with the bat? RON: Who were you talking to?
I'm talking to you. JUDY: Why are you so sweaty and filthy?
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.
We heard voices and noises and we thought maybe you were...
It doesn't matter what we thought. What was that light?
No, what light? What? There's no light, Dad! There's no light!
You got two lights in your hand! That's what it is.
You got two lights in your hand! That's what it is. Maybe it bounced... There was light under the door.
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce into my room like that.
You got to knock. You got to communicate.
We knocked for five minutes. I'm a teenager.
We knocked. You didn't knock.
You were screaming at me, okay? No.
This is repression, what you're doing here.
You're ruining my youth, okay? Oh, for Pete's sakes!
You are so defensive! Were you masturbating?
Judy. Was I...
No, Mom. Zip it, okay?
It's okay. No, I don't masturbate!
That's not something for you to bring up.
That's a father-and-son thing, okay? Father-son thing.
I mean, you don't have to call it that word if that makes you uncomfortable.
You can call it Sam's happy time or...
Happy time? ...my special alone time...
Stop. Mom.
Judy, stop. ...with myself.
Mom, you can't come in and... I'm sorry.
It's just been a weird night. I've had a little bit to drink.
No, no, Dad. Yeah, well, we saw a light.
Oh, parents.
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.
Earthquake! It's another one! Another earthquake! Get in the doorway!
JUDY: Okay! Aftershock! Aftershock!
Oh, I hate these.
Got to ride it out. Ride it out! Quick, hide.
JUDY: Hey, the lights are back on. Hide? What?
Where? Come on, get out of that tub.
RON: Can't you take safety seriously?
Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam. Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.
Oh, no! Look at the yard. The yard is destroyed.
Judy? Better call the city. We got a blown transformer!
Power pole's sparking all over the place!
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.
Trashed. Gone.
It's a wash. The whole yard. JUDY: You're kidding.
The parents are very irritating.
RATCHET: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can I take them out?
Ironhide, you know we don't harm humans.
What is with you?
Well, I'm just saying we could. It's an option.
We heard you talking to somebody, Sam.
We wanna know who. Mom, I told...
Hi. I'm Mikaela.
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.
Gosh, you're gorgeous. Isn't that the prettiest girl?
She can hear you talking, Mom. Thank you.
Thank you. Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to hear our little family discussion about...
RON: Sorry that we're bugging you. Do you have my backpack?
Come on, hon. Let's go. Oh, it's in the kitchen.
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.
Yeah. Your mom's so nice.
I want you to distract my parents
while I slip out and get these glasses to them, okay?
Ronald Wickity? It's Witwicky. Who are you?
We're the government. Sector Seven.
Never heard of it. Never will.
Your son's the great-grandson of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?
It's Witwicky.
May I enter the premises, sir?
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.
What the heck is going on here?
Your son filed a stolen car report last night.
We think it's involved in a national security matter.
JUDY: They're ripping up my rose bushes! National security?
That's right. National security.
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.
There's guys in suits all around the house! Look at this!
Could you stay off the grass?
Get me a sample and some isotope readings.
They're pulling bushes out of the ground!
Good Lord! They've got to get their hands off my bush!
Drop the bat, ma'am. Hey, hey, hey, that's my...
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.
But you'd better get those guys out of my garden
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!
Are you experiencing any flu-like symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?
JUDY: No! What is this?
How you doing, son? Is your name Sam?
Yeah. Well, I need you to come with us.
Whoa, way out of line.
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.
You're not taking my son. Really?
You gonna try to get rough with us?
No, but I'm gonna call the cops
because there's something fishy going on around here.
Yeah. There's something a little fishy about you, your son,
your little Taco Bell dog and this whole operation you got going on here.
What operation? That is what we are gonna find out.
I think direct contact.
Son? SAM: Yeah.
Step forward, please. Just stand?
Fourteen rads.
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!
SIMMONS: Get me a sample on that vegetation ASAP!
RON: Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!
Yeah. Not a word until we get a lawyer!
So,
LadiesMan217.
That is your eBay username, right?
Yeah, but, you know, it was a typo and I ran with it.
What do you make of this?
My name is Sam Witwicky, okay? And my...
Is that you?
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.
Last night at the station, you told the officer your car transformed.
Enlighten me. Well, here's what I said, okay?
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding that my car had been stolen...
Really? ...from me, from my home,
but it's fine now because it's back! It came back!
Well, not by itself. Well, no.
Because cars don't do that because that would be crazy.
That's funny. That is so funny.
So what do you kids know about aliens, huh?
Oh, you mean, like a Martian? Like what,  E.T.?  No.
It's an urban legend. Yeah.
You see this?
You see this? This is an I-can-do- whatever-I-want and- get-away-with-it badge.
Right. I'm gonna lock you up forever.
Oh, God. You know what? Don't listen to him.
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to get back to guarding the mall.
You, in the training bra, do not test me.
Especially with your daddy's parole coming up.
What? Parole?
It's nothing. Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?
You know those cars my dad used to teach me to fix?
Well, they... They weren't always his.
You stole cars?
Well, we couldn't always afford a babysitter,
so sometimes he had to take me along.
She's got her own juvie record to prove it!
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot in jail the rest of his natural life.
It is time to talk!
Big! It's big!
Go, go, go, go!
I can't see it! I can't see it! Shift your weight towards the front!
All right! All right!
You A-holes are in trouble now.
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you to my friend, Optimus Prime.
OPTIMUS: Taking the children was a bad move.
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.
Freeze!
Whoa! Whoa! Give me those!
Whoa!
Hi, there.
You don't seem afraid. Are you not surprised to see us?
Look, there are S-Seven protocols, okay?
I'm not authorized to communicate with you
except to tell you I can't communicate with you.
Get out of the car. All right.
Me? You want me to get... Now!
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.
All right, I'm... I'm getting out. I'm getting out. You see?
Very nifty how you put us down without really killing us.
You're good with handcuffs, too, now, huh? SIMMONS: How you doing?
SIMMONS: How you doing?
You weren't supposed to hear all that. How's it going, huh?
Yeah. This is real.
Now, listen. If I choose to engage with him, mum is the word, all right?
Sam, I have a record because I wouldn't turn my dad in.
When have you had to sacrifice anything in your perfect little life?
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.
I'm the one who asks questions around here. Not you, young man!
How'd you know about the aliens? Where did you take my parents?
I am not at liberty to discuss it. No?
Hey. You touch me, that's a federal offense.
Do-whatever-you-want and- get-away-with-it badge, right?
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with his big alien friend standing over there.
Where is Sector Seven? Wouldn't you like to know?
Hey!
OPTIMUS: Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.
Get that thing to stop, huh?
All right, tough guy, take it off. What are you talking about?
Your clothes, all of it, off. For what?
For threatening my dad.
Little lady, this is the beginning of the end of your life.
You're a criminal.
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.
Those are nice. Now get behind the pole.
All right.
This is such a felony, what you're doing.
I will hunt you down, okay? He'll hunt you down.
Without any remorse! No remorse.
Enjoy. Okay?
We have got to alert everyone. They already know. Speaker.
IRONHIDE: Optimus! Incoming!
Roll out.
PILOT 1: Okay, I'm picking up rad readings under that bridge right down there. (SIRENS BLARING)
Okay, I'm getting really good rad readings. Forty-two and higher.
Up you get.
PILOT 2: Okay, we're dropping in.
Really strong readings right down below us. There he is.
Ship one and two, come on in.
That's it, right there. Mark him, mark him.
Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30. Right off the nose.
I got it. 12:00.
Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.
Got him going down the street.
Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him. Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?
Okay, I lost him. I lost him.
Okay, we're coming around.
OPTIMUS: Easy, you two.
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping! I'm slipping!
OPTIMUS: Hold on! No!
Sam!
All right, we've got him pinned. We've got him pinned in the river.
I'm in for the shot.
Stop! Stop!
Wait! No!
Take the shot, get him. Take the shot.
No!
No! Stop!
Stop!
AGENT: Get down on the ground! Get down! Get down!
What? Okay.
(BOTH GRUNTING) Look, he's not fighting back!
COMMANDO 1: Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!
Stop hurting him!
COMMANDO 2: Don't let him move!
I got him here!
No!
Happy to see me again?
Put him in a car with his little criminal friend.
I want that thing frozen and ready for transport!
JAZZ: Hang back. Let me check it out.
Optimus,
are we just gonna stand here and do nothing?
OPTIMUS: There's no way to free Bumblebee without harming the humans.
But it's not right. He... Let them leave.
The Chinese and the Russians are nearing our area of operations
in the western Pacific.
We feel like this could get out of hand real fast.
But the next couple of hours may just define his presidency.
US and Chinese task forces approaching 100 nautical miles
of cruise missile range.
Tell the strike group commander that he's not to engage unless fired on first.
Yes, sir! Mr. Secretary?
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven, Advanced Research Division.
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom. I think you can see that.
What's going on here? I don't know.
Sit rep! Talk to me!
The whole room's gone down, sir. I can see that!
The virus was coded to shut us down.
General? I'll take a seat.
What do you mean, "shut us down"?
They used our network to spread out to the whole world.
The blackout's global.
We have no communications, satellite and land lines are dead.
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick up this telephone and call my family? (DEAD TONE)
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under direct order from the President.
You really need to see what I have in the case.
BANACHEK: You'll have to accept that there are certain things
you won't understand right away.
Sector Seven is a special-access division of the government
convened in secret under President Hoover 80 years ago.
You may remember NASA JPL lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.
We told them to report the mission a complete failure. It wasn't.
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.
This was classified above top secret.
MAN: EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.
This is the image from Mars.
Here's the image your Special Ops team was able to retrieve
from the base attack.
We believe they are of the same exoskeletal type,
and obviously not Russian or North Korean.
Are we talking about an invasion?
We intercepted the message from your Special Ops team.
These things can be hurt by our weapons and now they know it.
That's why the virus shut us down,
so we can't coordinate against their next attack,
which I would bet my ridiculous government salary is coming soon.
Get word to our fleet commanders over the National Guard frequency.
It's a shortwave radio channel. It might be still working.
Tell them to turn their ships around and come home. ASAP!
And inform all commands to prepare for imminent attack.
Captain Lennox, we need you and your team to come with us right now!
Let's go!
She's in here.
What's going on?
You're coming with me.
You're going to be my advisor. Me, too?
Who's this?
He's my advisor. He comes, too.
So... What'd they get you for?
I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot.
Wow.
Who knew?
(BUMBLEBEE GROANING) COMMANDO: Make a hole! Watch your back!
Please, let this work.
Fire it up, Optimus.
The code.
The code on these glasses indicates the All Spark is 230 miles from here.
I sense the Decepticons are getting ready to mobilize.
They must know it's here, as well.
What about Bumblebee?
We can't just leave him to die and become some human experiment!
OPTIMUS: He'll die in vain if we don't accomplish our mission.
Bumblebee is a brave soldier. This is what he would want.
Why are we fighting to save the humans?
They're a primitive and violent race.
Were we so different?
They're a young species. They have much to learn.
But I've seen goodness in them.
Freedom is the right of all sentient beings.
You all know there's only one way to end this war.
We must destroy the Cube.
If all else fails, I will unite it with the spark in my chest.
That's suicide.
The Cube is raw power. It could destroy you both.
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace to this planet.
We cannot let the humans pay for our mistakes.
It's been an honor serving with you all.
Autobots, roll out! We rolling!
EPPS: Team attention! Present arms!
At ease. Captain, Sergeant. Got your intel. Excellent work.
Thank you, sir. What about the gunships?
They're being retrofitted with sabot rounds now.
If they hit us again, we'll be ready for them.
But it won't do us much good if we can't get world communications back up.
Hey, kid.
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?
You must be hungry?
You want a latte? HoHo? Double venti macchiato?
Where's my car?
Son, I need you to listen to me very carefully.
People can die here.
We need to know everything you know. We need to know it now.
Okay.
But first, I'll take my car, my parents. Maybe you should write that down.
Oh, and her juvie record. That's got to be gone. Like, forever.
Come with me. We'll talk about your car.
Thank you.
The man's an extortionist.
SIMMONS: All right, here's the situation.
You've all had direct contact with the NBEs.
NBEs?
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials. Try and keep up with the acronyms.
What you're about to see is totally classified.
Dear God. What is this?
BANACHEK: We think when he made his approach over the north pole,
our gravitational field screwed up his telemetry.
He crashed in the ice, probably a few thousand years ago.
We shipped him here to this facility in 1934.
SIMMONS: We call him NBE One.
SAM: Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you on everything you think you know,
but, I mean, that's Megatron.
He's the leader of the Decepticons.
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.
Your great-great-grandfather made one of the greatest discoveries
in the history of mankind.
Fact is, you're looking at the source of the modern age,
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars, all reverse-engineered by studying him.
NBE One. That's what we call it.
And you didn't think the United States military might need to know
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot frozen in the basement?
Until these events, we had no credible threat to national security.
Well, you got one now.
So why Earth? SAM: It's the All Spark.
All Spark? What is that?
Well, yeah, they came here looking for some sort of cube-looking thing.
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA Megatron, that's what they call him,
who's pretty much the harbinger of death, wants to use the Cube
to transform human technology to take over the universe.
That's their plan.
And you're sure about that? Yeah.
You guys know where it is, don't you?
Follow me.
SIMMONS: You're about to see our crown jewel.
TOM: Carbon dating puts the Cube here around 10,000 BC.
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.
They knew it was alien because of the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube
as well as NBE One.
President Hoover had the dam built around it.
Four football fields thick of concrete.
A perfect way to hide its energy from being detected by anyone
or any alien species on the outside.
Wait, back up. You said the dam hides the Cube's energy.
What kind exactly? TOM: Good question.
Please step inside. They have to lock us in.
Oh, wow.
What's that? Freddy Krueger done been up in here or something?
Oh, no, man.
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man. (SNARLS) That's only three. That's Wolverine!
Right? That's Wolverine! That's very funny.
Anybody have any mechanical devices? BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?
I got a phone.
Nokias are real nasty.
You've got to respect the Japanese. They know the way of the samurai.
Nokia's from Finland.
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange. He's a little strange.
SIMMONS: We're able to take the Cube radiation and funnel it into that box.
Mean little sucker, huh? That thing is freaky!
Kind of like the itty-bitty Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?
He's breaking the box.
COMMANDO: Go! Go! Go!
Move!
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.
Banachek. What's going on?
Well, the NBE One hangar has lost power...
What? ...and the backup generator
is just not gonna cut it. Do you have an arms room?
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!
I'll bring security to the...
Get everyone to the NBE One chamber now!
The lights are out! Move it! Move it!
Let's go!
They're popping our generators!
Megatron melting!
MAN ON PA: 16502. We're losing pressure.
Stand by! Set!
We're losing pressure!
The cryogenic system is failing! We're losing NBE One!
Forty millimeter sabot rounds on that table!
SOLDIER: That's good. Get all the ammo you got. Everything you can carry. Bring it.
You got to take me to my car. You have to take me to my car.
He's gonna know what to do with the Cube.
Your car? It's confiscated. Then unconfiscate it.
We do not know what will happen if we let it near this thing! You don't know. Maybe you know, but I don't know.
You don't know. Maybe you know, but I don't know.
You just wanna sit here and wait and see what happens? I have people's lives at stake here, young man.
I have people's lives at stake here, young man. Take him to his car!
Drop it.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Drop your weapon, soldier.
Drop your weapon, soldier. There's an alien war going on and you're gonna shoot me?
You know, we didn't ask to be here.
I'm ordering you under S-Seven executive jurisdiction.
S-Seven don't exist.
S-Seven don't exist. Right. And we don't take orders from people that don't exist.
I'm gonna count to five. Okay. Well, I'm gonna count to three.
KELLER: Simmons? Yes, sir?
I'd do what he says. Losing's really not an option for these guys.
All right. Okay.
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.
SAM: No, no!
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
No, no, stop, stop, stop! Let him go! Let him go!
Are you okay?
They didn't hurt you, right?
Listen to me. The Cube is here and the Decepticons are coming.
No, no, don't worry about them. They're okay. Right?
They're not gonna hurt you.
Just back up a little bit. He's friendly. He's fine.
Okay, come on. Put the guns down. They're not gonna hurt you.
Here, come with me. I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.
Okay, here we go. He doing something. He doing something.
Oh, my God.
WOMAN: Message from Starfleet, Captain.
MAN: Let's get to it.
MAN: Let's get to it. He's right. We stay here, we're screwed with Megatron in the other hangar.
Mission City is 22 miles away.
We're gonna sneak that Cube out of here
and we're gonna hide it somewhere in the city.
Good! Right.
But we cannot make a stand without the Air Force.
This place must have some kind of radio link!
Yes. Shortwave, CB. Right, yes.
Sir, you got to figure out some way to get word out to them. Let's move!
In the alien archive, sir!
The alien... There's an old Army radio console.
Will it work? Anything's possible!
Did you see that... LENNOX: All right, Sam, get it in the car!
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.
When we get to the city, we're gonna find a radio,
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?
KELLER: Affirmative!
MAN ON PA: Warning! NBE One cryo-containment failing.
Check that backup system!
MAN: The cryo's failing! You got to bump up the cryo! The cryo's failing!
MAN 2: Come on! Get out of here!
Heads up! Look out!
Set a perimeter around the yellow vehicle!
This way, this way, this way! Up there! Let's go!
I am Megatron!
SAM: The Cube's okay? Yeah, it's fine.
Well, put the seat belt on.
Pour it on him!
STARSCREAM: I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.
Where is the Cube?
The humans have taken it.
You fail me yet again, Starscream. Get them!
GLEN: Come on, Mags!
Over here, sir!
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me. Plugged in there.
We're hot! We're live! Where are the mikes?
Mikes?
Mikes? This doesn't work without mikes, Simmons.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
KELLER: Let's find them.
KELLER: Let's find them. Kid, get in the chair! Just get in the chair, all right?
Kid, get in the chair! Just get in the chair, all right? Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit. They steal everything out of this place.
How do we get the signal out? How do we call the Air Force?
Glen? Huh?
Can you hotwire this computer to transmit a tone through the radio?
What good is that?
Morse code! You can use this to transmit it through that!
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around. Okay, let's see.
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!
There's Optimus.
GLEN: Almost done.
(CLANGING) What the hell was that?
Barricade the door!
KELLER: Get something. Watch out!
Six, five, four, six, three.
Here! Put some rounds in!
Master search.
I got it! We're transmitting!
Send exactly what I say!
Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Burn, you little sucker! Burn!
"This is Defense Secretary Keller." Uh-huh. "Get me NORTHCOM commander."
Whoa! Whoa!
What was that?
Authenticate emergency action. Blackbird 1195...
Sir, I have an authenticated air strike order from Sec Def.
No, no, no, no, no. What?
It's the same cop! Block them, block them, block them.
Oh, my God.
Cool, Mom!
This is so not good.
He's behind the pillar!
GLEN: Shoot that mother... Maggie, cover fire!
GLEN: It's the Air Force! They're responding!
Sucker, burn!
Oh, shit!
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!
PILOT ON RADIO: Raptors, let's scramble, scramble, scramble.
PILOT 2: Strike and Dark Star roll call.
PILOT 3: Looking out the right side.
PILOT 4: Push to Kill Box One Alpha...
Come on, let's go! Mount up! SOLDIER: Move out! Move out! Go! Go!
Here, I got shortwave radios.
Wait. What am I supposed to do with these?
Well, use them! It's all we got!
EPPS: This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios or something, man.
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles out of these things.
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles out of these things. Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?
F-22 at 12:00.
All right, I want planes for air cover and get Black Hawks on station
to extract that Cube. You got it?
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?
EPPS: We have you visual.
Green smoke is the mark.
Provide air cover and vector Black Hawks for extraction.
It's Starscream!
Please tell me you copy.
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!
No, no, no, no, no! Move!
Back up! Back up! LENNOX: Retreat! Fall back!
IRONHIDE: Incoming!
LENNOX: Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?
SOLDIER: Clear the area!
(BUMBLEBEE GROANING) SAM: Oh, my God.
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!
Your legs.
Here. Here, back, back, back, back! You all right?
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!
Ratchet!
What the hell was that? What are you talking about?
What do you mean, what am I talking about? They shot at us!
F-22 pilots would never fly below buildings.
That's alien. That ain't friendly!
You got to get up. You're okay. You're okay.
Come on!
PILOT: Army Black Hawk inbound to your location. Over.
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.
Move out! Let's go!
SOLDIER: Let's go! Move!
I'm not gonna leave you.
Come on, Decepticon punk!
Oh, my God!
Concentrate your fire!
Come on. Come on.
Megatron!
OPTIMUS: It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!
Fall back!
Get our guys out of the way! Get out of here! Go!
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!
EPPS: We need air cover down here now!
Sam, help me with this.
JAZZ: That all you got, Megatron? Come here, little cretin.
You want a piece of me? You want a piece?
No! I want two!
LENNOX: What's going on?
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.
Oh, these things just don't die.
Oh, we're so dead.
Wrap it around the head.
Sam! Where's the Cube?
Right there. Okay.
SAM: And take that and wrap it around
the base and then put it around his neck.
Okay? Epps, get those Black Hawks here!
That building.
Okay. What?
All right, I can't leave my guys back there, so here, take this flare.
Okay, there's a tall, white building with statues on top.
Go to the roof. Set the flare. No.
Signal the chopper and set the flare. No, no. I can't do this!
Listen to me! You're a soldier now! All right? I need you to take this Cube.
Get it into military hands while we hold them off,
or a lot of people are gonna die.
You got to go. You got to go. No, I'm not leaving.
You need to go. Go. No, I'm not leaving
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?
Army Black Hawk requested.
Immediate evac for civilian boy with precious cargo.
Headed to rooftop marked by flare.
Sam, we will protect you. Okay.
LENNOX: Epps, where are those planes? Sam!
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you.
Sam! Get to the building! Move!
MEGATRON: Decepticons, attack! Hit it!
RATCHET: Cover fire! SOLDIER: Move to cover!
Watch out!
LENNOX: Girl, get that tow truck out of here! I'm going! I'm going!
Get out of here now!
Megatron!
Prime.
Humans don't deserve to live.
They deserve to choose for themselves.
Then you will die with them!
Join them in extinction!
Keep moving, Sam!
Don't stop!
No!
Sam, get to the building!
Give me that Cube, boy!
Did that jerk just dent my car?
You're not gonna get me. You're not gonna get me!
(EXCLAIMS IN ALIEN LANGUAGE) MEGATRON: I smell you, boy!
Maggot!
Oh, no!
I'll drive! You shoot!
This isn't going well!
Shoot! Shoot!
Nice shot.
SOLDIER: That tank is definitely dead now. LENNOX: All right, let's go! We got business!
Hey!
Hey! I'm over here!
We've got the boy.
Watch out!
Missile!
Hang on, Sam!
No! No!
Is it fear or courage that compels you, fleshling?
Where do I go?
Give me the All Spark and you may live to be my pet.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm never giving you this All Spark!
Oh, so unwise.
I got you, boy.
Hold on to the Cube!
SAM: Oh, no. Oh, no! Disgusting.
Sam?
You risked your life to protect the Cube.
No sacrifice,
no victory. If I cannot defeat Megatron,
you must push the Cube into my chest.
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.
Get behind me.
It's you and me, Megatron.
No, it's just me, Prime.
OPTIMUS: At the end of this day, one shall stand, one shall fall.
You still fight for the weak! That is why you lose!
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys. Targets will be marked.
Hey.
Bring the rain. All right?
All right, let's kill these things.

Hold up.

Sam, I owe you my life.
We are in your debt.
Prime, we couldn't save him.
Aw, Jazz.
We lost a great comrade
but gained new ones.
Thank you, all of you.
You honor us with your bravery.
Permission to speak, sir?
Permission granted, old friend.
You speak now?
I wish to stay with the boy.
If that is his choice.
Yes.
Gentlemen, the President has ordered Sector Seven be terminated
and the remains of the dead aliens disposed of.
The Laurentian Abyss is seven miles below sea level,
deepest place on our planet.
The massive depth and pressure there, coupled with subfreezing temperatures,
would crush and entomb them,
leaving no evidence.
OPTIMUS: With the All Spark gone, we cannot return life to our planet.
And fate has yielded its reward,
a new world to call home.
We live among its people now, hiding in plain sight,
but watching over them in secret,
waiting, protecting.
I have witnessed their capacity for courage.
I have witnessed their capacity for courage. And though we are worlds apart,
like us, there's more to them than meets the eye.
I am Optimus Prime
and I send this message to any surviving Autobots
taking refuge among the stars.
We are here.
We are waiting.
Can you shed any light on the recent, so-called alien activity in the area?
Do you know what? I think that if there was some sort of an alien
infestation... Yeah.
They, the government, would be the first to let you know.
The government would let us know.
I mean, this is America. Yeah.
You know, that's how we know we live in a free land,
because there's no secrets.

[Annie] Child-rearing around the world boasts
a wide variety of customs and mores.
But perhaps the most bizarre social patterns
[Annie] can be found within the small island community of Manhattan.
[man] Asshole!
[Annie] The inhabitants of the region known as the Upper East Side,
have the most prosperous, yet idiosyncratic social systems on the planet.
After successfully mating and producing offspring,
the men are often distant and uninvolved,
leaving their women to hunt, gather and provide
leaving their women to hunt, gather and provide for their families.
Yet the resourceful mothers of the Upper East Side
have plenty of time to participate
in a variety of sex-role- specific activities.
These include body mutilation,
sacred meditation,
even fasting rituals.
Which brings us to our focus on child-rearing.
Who actually does it?
Well, in Africa, they have a saying. It takes a village to raise a child.
But for the tribe of the Upper East Side, it takes just one person.
The nanny.
Okay, so what's depicted here is not
a typical tribal ritual,
but rather the unraveling of one such nanny.
Actually, this nanny is me.
And why I'm telling off a teddy bear is the subject of this field diary.
If by chance my report stereotypes or geographically profiles, forgive me.

Oh my God! Spaz!
[Annie] And here's the woman who reared me, pretty much all by herself.
She's a nurse. Note the shoes.
What is it?
You'll see.
Thank you.
[Judy Braddock] I know it's not much, but I wanted to buy you your first business suit.
Thanks.
Thank you. You can look back on this when you're a famous CFO.
Oh, Mom. Gosh, come on. It's one meeting at Goldman Sachs.
It's highly competitive. I'm probably never gonna get the job.
All right, stop with the negativity.
Your father was always negative and look where it got him.

I would give the world to be sitting where you're sitting right now.
You are so much smarter than I was.
No man is gonna squash your dreams.
No one's gonna tell you how to live your life.
Maybe I'm not CFO material, you know?
No, what if I'm better suited at something else?
Like what? Anthropology? Honey how are you gonna make a living at that?
Look, if you really wanna run around in grass skirts,
then make enough money to spend Christmas at Club Med.

at 8:00 a.m., party girl. Let's just say that you missed a fabulous throw-down
and Tom Waylan was there. So?
He asked about you. Twice.
All right, well, I gotta go. Real life awaits. God.
You know, I bet none of those cultures you study practice such rigorous celibacy.
You ever hear of the Shakers? [Lynette] Yes, and they're extinct.
[Annie] Excuse me, sir? -Sir. -Yeah?
I got off at the wrong stop. Can you tell me where Chambers Street is, please?
You see the building with the red umbrella? Yes. It's about five blocks below that.
Oh shit.
[human resources director] Our financial analyst training program is so competitive.
We have over 8,000 applicants for 10 positions.
So, why don't you tell me, in your own words,
who exactly is Annie Braddock?
Wow, that's certainly an easy enough question.
Wow, that's certainly an easy enough question. Mm-hm.
Annie Braddock is a kind…
Well…
I am…
Go on.
Well, you see…
I have absolutely no idea. Excuse me.
[Annie] Who is Annie Braddock? It wasn't exactly a trick question,
yet somehow I couldn't formulate a response.
Of course I knew all the basic facts.
The date of birth, home town, socioeconomic makeup.
But I didn't really know who I was, where I fit in,
But I didn't really know who I was, where I fit in, who I was gonna be.

[Annie] How about her? This woman, could she be Annie Braddock?

♪ You're a native New Yorker ♪
Hmm.
Or perhaps this is Annie Braddock?
[Annie] On that spring afternoon,
it seemed my future was finally set.
A Central Park bag lady I would be.
At least I'd finally get to live in Manhattan.
But before I officially surrendered to fate,
something, or rather, someone, intervened.
Hello there. Hi. Are you okay?
Get off of me, you pervert.
Do you belong to anyone, little man?
[Mrs. X] Grayer! I belong to you.
[Mrs. X] Grayer!
Oh God. Thank you so much.
You just averted a minor disaster.
[Annie] The woman featured here,
the one wearing the Dior snakeskin jacket and Louis Vuitton shoes,
is unfortunately not Annie Braddock.

She is, in fact, a perfect female specimen from the Upper East Side clan.
For the purpose of this case study, we'll just call her Mrs. X.
Hi, I'm Mrs. X. Let me apologize for my feral son.
Let me apologize for my feral son.
Oh, no, no need to apologize. Please, I love kids.
I'm Annie. You're a nanny? Oh!
No, I'm not. No wonder. You're so good with children.
Oh, I'm not. Actually, I just lost my nanny, Bertie,
which is why I'm out in this godforsaken park by myself. Okay.
She left us to go get married. All right.
Oh my God. Are you employed?
No, unfortunately I- Fabulous!
Look, here is my card.
Please, please, please call me later this week. We'll schedule a lunch. Anywhere you'd like to go.
I'm sorry- The Mark, the Four Seasons.
Unfortunately, I have to run, but I really look forward to hearing from you.
I'm sorry, I really think you misunderstood me. I have a very good feeling about this.
Call me.
[glamour mom] Pardon me, I couldn't help but overhear. I'm looking for a new nanny too.
Oh I- Can I give you my card as well? Excuse me?
I pay well above average. I have a card too, call me.
I have a place in the Hamptons. Donald Trump lives in my building.
[Annie] It seemed that fate now offered me a wonderful alternative.
An opportunity to completely duck out of my life.
So, I decided for one summer to abandon Annie and trade her in for a brand-new persona.
and trade her in for a brand-new persona. Nanny.
Of course, there was one tiny problem.
Everything I knew about nannying came from the movies.
Even so, I fell asleep confident
that I'd magically find my way.
[Lynette] Annie?
Annie!
[Lynette] Annie?
Get your feet on the ground, young lady.
[Annie] The fact that I had no child-care experience
mattered little to the matriarchs of the Upper East Side.
Even though I don't have a job,
I just don't seem to have enough time for myself.
[Annie] All they needed to know was that I was white, a college grad, and terminally single.
a college grad, and terminally single.
As you can see, my husband and I are getting a divorce.
So, you and the kids must remain
on my side of the apartment at all times,
until the custody battle is settled.
In short, I was the Chanel bag of nannies.
I heard through the grapevine you've been meeting with a lot of people.
So I thought you might appreciate a civilized lunch at Bergdorf's rather than
being interviewed at the apartment. Thank you, that's very considerate.
Not really. I just love to eat out.
I'll probably come up with a million excuses for us to go have lunch.
If you end up with us, I mean.
[server] Ready? Do you know what you're having?
I don't mean to rush you, but I'm attending a 2:00 lecture at the Parents' Society.
Super mom, trying to juggle it all.
I'll just have the burger. Thanks.
I can't guarantee that the meat here is antibiotic-free.
But the chef here is from Brittany, so I highly recommend the crepe Bretagne. Deux, s'il vous plait.
Okay. [waiter] Excellent choice.
Thanks.
You're from New Jersey. Unfortunately.
Oh no, there are some very lovely parts of that state.
Friends of ours have a horse farm in Upper Saddle River.
Really? Mm-hm. I hear it's really nice there.
I'll have to take you riding there one day.
Okay. Tell me more. I wanna know all about you.
I'm from Connecticut, actually. I went to Smith.
I went to Smith. And don't believe the rumors, we weren't all lesbians.
After graduation, I moved here and started running Gagosian.
The art gallery. Oh.
It was a blast. But you really, you can't do that sort of thing when you're raising a child.
The parties, the schmoozing, the travel…
Oh, excuse me. Oh.
Bitsy. It's you.
Bitsy. I've so been meaning to call.
Is there anything at all I can do? Not unless you know a hit man.
That lawyer Jeanie Whitman recommended was no help at all.
I am so sorry. Turns out all our assets are actually
Turns out all our assets are actually in Tucker's company's name.
All I'm getting is a million flat. That's appalling.
If I'd known it would go this far, I would have just turned a blind eye.
Anyway, enjoy the rest of your lunch before I ruin that too.
I'll call you later this week, sweetheart.
Such a shame.
But she should have seen it coming. Everyone else did.
Anyway, where were we? Ah yes.
After Gagosian, I met Mr. X.
[Lynette] You know, my grandmother worked as a domestic so we wouldn't have to.
And here you are, fresh out of college, voluntarily taking a nanny gig.
I told you, this is not a lifelong commitment, okay?
It's just a way for me to get my head together.
Besides, the money is great. I finally get to move to the city.
I'm moving to the city to go to grad school, not to be somebody's servant.
Plus you know you're wrong, or you wouldn't be lying to your mother.
This is all just happening too fast.
I don't understand why you can't just live at the house for a while, just to get on your feet.
just to get on your feet. Mom, I lived at home through four years of college. Don't you think that's long enough?
Well, how could you find a decent apartment so fast?
The bank has, you know, an excellent program.
They've got me hooked up with a trainee, which is great.
I'm getting in the car. Can I come with you?
I would feel a lot better if I could at least see where you were living.
Come on. The other trainees, you know,
they went to fancy boarding schools and European exchange programs.
If I show up with my mom, I'll just look like a big dork.
Guess that makes sense.
Come here. I love you.
Let me know the minute I can visit you.
I'll call you when I get there, okay?

I can't believe this. I could get used to this, I'm telling you that.
Thank God I'm getting a shrink degree.
You know, I love you, but you're harsh.
A little bit. Just give me a hug.
I'll see you soon, I'm sure.
Annie?
You know the path of least resistance?
It can lead through a mine field.
Oh, hi.
You are the new nanny? Yes, and you must be Maria.
Yes, and you must be Maria. Nice to meet you. Hmm.
Can I come in? Okay.
Leave it there. The floor is clean. Mm.
This place is incredible.
I hope you last longer than the last one.
Who, Bertie? Oh yeah, Mrs. X told me that she left to get married.
Married? She had one date and she get fired.
Oh, Maria? Are you gonna tell Mrs.X that I've arrived?
Mrs. X is shopping. But she left you a note on the table.
Now I have to go run the vacuum, okay? Ay.
Dear Nanny, welcome!
[Annie] Please make note that from here on in, I'm referred to as Nanny by all the people
I'm referred to as Nanny by all the people in the Xs' social network.
[Mrs. X] I'm so excited to have you onboard.
Please make yourself completely at home.
Manuel is making you your own set of keys. You should have them by tomorrow.
The fridge is well-stocked.
Tofu cutlets? Ugh.
Help yourself to anything. Yuck.
Sorry I could not be there to meet you
but I'm trying to squeeze in a little shopping before my Parents' Society meeting,
which reminds me, please pick Grayer up
which reminds me, please pick Grayer up from the Christian preschool at 2:15 sharp.
It's extremely important not to be late. Ooh.
As you can see, I have attached a list of basic house rules.
Hello, Manolo.
We believe it's important to maintain some sense of structure in our home
for Grayer's sake.
Rule number one: Grayer and his playmates
Rule number one: Grayer and his playmates are never allowed in the master bedroom. Oops.
Of course, you should refrain from entering our bedroom as well.
Rule number two: Grayer is never allowed to nap during the day. No naps?
No naps? This throws his sleeping schedule completely off,
and I prefer him tired when I get home.
Rule number three: we just had the walls redone.
Please keep Grayer from rubbing up against them.
Oh! Rule number four: if school is ever canceled,
the following non-structured outings are permissible.
The Met, the Morgan Library, the French Culinary Institute,
the French Culinary Institute, the New York Stock Exchange.
Rule number five: we do not take the subway because of germs. [Annie] Oh, God.
Rule number six:
Grayer still must be in a stroller when crossing Park or Madison. Blah, blah, blah, blah.
Rule number seven:
Grayer maintains a high-soy organic diet.
Rule number eight:
practice French with Grayer at least three times a week.
His father wants him to attend Collegiate where he's currently wait-listed.
French? Holy merde.
His acceptance is a top priority.
Mon Dieu.
Nanny?
Nanny?
What are you doing? The note said to pick up Grayer from school at 2:15. Hm.
And it's only one o'clock.
So I was a little sweaty from moving and I thought that I would, you know…
What I mean is, what are you doing in that bathtub?
And why are your bags strewn all over the guest room?
I thought that was my room.
No.
No, Nanny.
This is your room.
Okay.
Yeah, this is very sweet.
I'm sorry. Do you have the time?
2:15. So they'll be getting out anytime now?
2:45. I'm sorry?
They get out every day at 2:45.
Dumbass.
[Annie] It quickly became clear that Mrs. X had arranged
for me to arrive everywhere torturously early.
Get ready, ladies. Here they come.
Grayer? Grayer?
Grayer X? Who is it you're looking for?
Grayer. I know that one.
He plays with my wee monster, Darwin. Hay-ya!
Oh, Grayer, there you are. Hey, little man, you remember me?
Yes, and I hate you!
What? Come on, we get along great, remember? Like when we met in Central Park?
Let me get your backpack.
Stop. Grayer, stop. Help, police! She's hurting me!
They usually start out that way, you know. Yes.
Danger, danger! Just be patient, eh?
Let me put you in your stroller, okay? Hold on one second.
I'm too big for a stroller! Grayer!
-Help, police! -Grayer!
Grayer! Grayer!
Grayer! Come here!
I hate you, I want Bertie! I know, honey. I know you want Bertie.
Bertie had to leave to get married or go on a date or something, okay?
But I promise, we're gonna have a lot of fun together, honestly. All right?
Now let me see how handsome you look in your uniform.
What's that?
Don't touch that! It belongs to my daddy!
I hate you. I want Bertie. Grayer.
[Annie] Already, one had to wonder,
what kind of culture would turn a father's business card
into a security blanket?
Here we are. Home sweet home.
First mission accomplished.
Grayer, get up off the floor. It's very dirty. Nuh-uh.
I have an idea. Why don't we race to the front door? Okay, last one there is a rotten egg.
I'm not stupid. You're just gonna let me win.
No, I am a mighty good runner, mister.
Not with your pants down. Oh my God!
Oh shit! The stroller!
Shit! Grayer!
You said a curse. I'm telling Mommy.
Grayer, I am not kidding. Open this door right now.
Maria! Touch my fingers.
Ow! I am not letting go until you open the door! Ow!
Pardon me.
I think this belongs to Grayer. Rode the elevator to the 12th floor.
Thank you. You're welcome.
Sorry, we're having a little bit of a situation here.
By the way, my name's [bleep].
[Annie] Since my job required a vow of chastity,
it was essential that I avoided all intimacies, especially first names.
For the purpose of this field diary, let's just call him Harvard Hottie.
I'm the Xs' new nanny. Oh.
Very new, as you can probably tell.
[Grayer] I'm taking off all my clothes.
Seems to be popular on this floor. Mind if I take a crack at him for you?
Mind if I take a crack at him for you?
Be my guest.
Hey, Grayer, it's your pal from upstairs.
Hey, would you be a sport and unlock the door? It's not nice to lock people out.
Please, buddy?
Hey. Why are you here?
Oh, I'm just helping out my new friend.
Annie. Annie.
Annie the nanny. She's your friend?
Yes, she's my friend. Isn't she your friend too?
Not yet.
Thank you. Anytime.
[Annie] Suddenly the world's most notorious loner
had two new men in her life.
Unfortunately, I knew that the big one was off-limits.
Based on my observations, guys like Harvard Hottie
only slum it when they're in college.
So, instead of following my heart,
I focused on finding a way into Grayer's.
Grayer, stop it.
[Annie] Befriending Grayer certainly wasn't easy.
La la la la la la! But then again, Margaret Mead didn't run home every time she contracted malaria. Whoa!
You're in trouble! I thought this job was supposed to be a way
I thought this job was supposed to be a way to get your head together?
Two weeks in and you already sound depressed, dejected and paranoid.
You forgot to mention malnourished.
I swear, all these people eat is bean curd and seltzer. Ew.
I mean, even the ice cream is made out of tofu.
So why don't you come down and have dinner with us then?
My new roomie's making gumbo.
[roommate] It's not gumbo. It's Creole bouillabaisse.
I don't get it. You move to the city and overnight
your life becomes "Will & Grace".
I'm here, knee-deep in…
Shit. It's probably my mom. She's the only one who has this number.
Bye. Hello?
Annie? Hi.
My God. An entire week has gone by and you haven't called me back.
Mom, I told you I was gonna be so busy with work.
Oh come on. You can't find five minutes to call your worried mother?
How are you, honey? How's the job? How's the apartment?
God, everything is just perfect.
I mean, the job is a dream.
A little challenging. So rewarding though.
And the apartment is just incredible. Yeah?
And my roommate could not be nicer.
Nanny, in the morning, I need you to stop at Tiffany's and pick up Mr. X's watch.
Then I need you to Xerox the recommendation letters for Grayer's Collegiate application.
Also, I was thinking, we should introduce French food into his diet. It might enhance his study of the language.
So tomorrow night, why don't you make him coquilles St. Jacques for dinner, hmm?
Annie? Dry cleaning.
Who was that, your roommate? Mom, I have to go.
I have some work stuff to take care of.
Wait a minute, I wanna make a plan to visit.
Hi, ladies.
So I took Madison to the doctor this morning. She had grown three inches in six months.
You take her to the doctor too?
Darling, I do everything. My job is a type C. Mmm.
Type C? What's type C?
Oh Jesus. Okay, newbie. Pay attention, honey.
Basically, there's three types of nanny gigs.
Okay, type A, you provide couple time a few nights a week
Okay, type A, you provide couple time a few nights a week for women who work all day and parent at night.
for women who work all day and parent at night.
Type B, you provide sanity time, every afternoon, right, to a woman who mothers in the mornings and the evenings.
to a woman who mothers in the mornings and the evenings.
And type C, the most common, you provide 24-7 me time to the woman who neither works nor mothers.
to the woman who neither works nor mothers.
So, which one are you?
I am type C. No question.
Although when I started I had no idea.
I thought it would be a kind of fun and easy job. You'd think a college graduate
You'd think a college graduate would choose a job a little more wisely.
Actually, this job kind of chose me.
Chose you?
Please, child. I left my country because I thought I could give my boy
I left my country because I thought I could give my boy and my sick mother a better life.
I was supposed to be here two or three years tops.
And while I've been raising these strangers' children,
my own child has grown up without a mother. That's how this job chose me.
That's how this job chose me.
Half a tablespoon of tarragon.
That's dried. -I like fresh. -Well, you know what? Dried's all we got, okay, kiddo?
I hate coquilles Jacques. I want sushi.
Well, then tell your mother you wanna learn Japanese. Mm!
Okay.
I'm telling Mommy. You're in trouble.
Okay.
That's it.
No, Mommy says they're full of high-fructose corn syrup.
Well, what mommy doesn't know won't hurt her, okay, Mr. Tattletale?
Eat it. Go on.
Right out of the jar.
It's okay.
It's yummy, isn't it? This is fun.
Yeah? This is fun. This is fun.
And this fun meal has to be our little secret, okay? Okay.
Okay.
Hey, you know, we can do lots of fun things. We just have to be friends and we have to trust each other. Okay?
Maybe you should have a secret name too.
You want a secret name? Yeah, I want a secret name. Okay.
How about Sponge Bob? No, silly.
No?
All right, what about…
What about Grover? Grover, I love Grover.
You do? All right. Grover it is.
[Mr. X] Where's my little munchkin? Daddy! Daddy's home!
Yay, Daddy. I hear him, I hear him!
Daddy! Oh, there he is!
Oh my goodness, I'm sorry, are you a little monster? Remember what happens to little monsters? Come here for a minute.
No, Daddy! You remember that or not? What's wrong with you? Daddy!
Come here for a minute. You get viciously tickled. You remember that?
-Huh? -Daddy, stop it. Hey, you my little superstar? Yeah.
-Are you? -Yeah. Are you gonna take over the world?
Come on, answer me. You gonna take over the world? Yes.
And when are you gonna do it? Next year.
Next year's not soon enough.
Well, you must be Mr. X. I'm the new nanny.
Yeah? Keep him quiet tonight, will you? I've got a merger I'm working on.
I don't get some decent shut-eye tonight, somebody around here's gonna be accountable.
Daddy, come see my dinosaur!
Daddy's got work to do, buddy. Please!
Hey, Grayer, don't be sad. It's okay, Daddy's just tired.
Grover.
Hey, you wanna finish our fun meal?
Come on! Yeah.
Nanny?
Yeah, Grover?
You'll never leave me like Bertie, will you?
Grover, you know I- Promise?
I'm not going anywhere. You know that, right, honey?
Right, Grove?
[Mrs. X] Dear Nanny, please remember that today
[Mrs. X] Dear Nanny, please remember that today is the 4th of July family party at Mr. X's office.
It probably slipped your mind that costumes are required,
so I took it upon myself to have some delivered.
This is itchy. I know, sweetheart.
Why do we have to dress up?
[Annie narrating] Freedom, Grove. It's all in the name of freedom.
Hey, guys. [Mr. X] Who is that?
That's the nanny, dear. You've met her.
What happened to Louisa?
[Mrs. X] That was two nannies ago, silly.
Yeah? Daddy, I'm George Washington.
[Mr. X] Okay. [Grover] Tickle me!
[Mr. X] No, I understand that, Dan, because the bastard's selling low.
[Grover] Please! [Mr. X] Grayer, come on, buddy. Cut it out, sit down.
Yes yes, we're coming. -We're coming. -[Mr. X] No, it's just my kid.
-We're coming. -[Mr. X] No, it's just my kid. Well no, that's what I was thinking,
-I couldn't believe it. -Where's my card? [Grover] Daddy!-
[Mr. X] Your what? [Grover] Where's my card!
Oh, I wanna go home! Hey, smile, Grove, we're gonna go to a party.
That's not my card. Where's my card? Would you get off that phone and tell the nanny
Would you get off that phone and tell the nanny to give him his damn card?
Nanny? Turn the car around.
Talk to the nanny, please. Nanny, go back and get the card.
Hold the elevator!
I'm sorry.
It's okay, don't be. At least I'm fully dressed this time, so…
I'm so sorry. It's not funny. I don't mean to be laughing.
You look very patriotic. Well, yeah.
Let me hit your floor. Oh, no, that's okay.
I got it. Didn't grow up with the staff doing everything for me, so…
Neither did I.
Really? You must have had it really rough then.
Okay, well, I'm glad to give you a good laugh.
[woman] My husband and I are taking our second honeymoon in Provence.
♪ And if you're good I'll take you home with me ♪ I'm looking for Mr. X, have you seen him?
No, sorry.
I wouldn't know him if I did. ♪ Macarena hey Macarena ♪
Grove, come on. What is wrong? Why won't you shake your booty?
'Cause I have to make a doodie.
Oh.
Hey, Grover, I think the bathroom's the other way.
My daddy has one in his office. Yeah?
I wanna go to my daddy's bathroom. Okay.
Oh. Why is Daddy tickling that lady?
I'm sorry. Grayer just had to use the bathroom.
So use it already.
Hello, Grayer. Remember me? I work with your daddy in the Chicago office.
Let go. I have to make a doodie.
So, you must be the nanny.
Yes, I…
I'll get out of your… I'll wait in the hall.
I'll wait in the hall.
So sorry.
Grayer, hurry up, your mom's coming.
Hey, sweetie. Did Grayer hear from the waiting-list committee yet?
No, why? Oh, I'm sure it doesn't mean anything,
but the Bairds did and Darwin got in.
Please don't say anything about Collegiate or Darwin to my husband.
Sure.
Oh, hi, pumpkin. There you are.
Oh, you've met before in Chicago, right?
-Yes, hello. -Lovely to see you. -Nice to see you as well. -Excuse me.
Thanks again. Mm-hm. Where have you been?
Making calls. Where's the chow?
The entire time? Yeah.
[Annie] Male monogamy remains an elusive
yet much mythologized practice throughout the world.
In many Bedouin tribes,
powerful men are encouraged to take multiple wives.
In contemporary France,
mistresses are de rigeur and quietly tolerated.
But for the women of the Upper East Side,
adultery is pathologically ignored.
[Mr. X] Nobody warned me we were gonna have a therapy session.
[Mrs. X] It's just that I didn't see you at all at the party.
Well, I was trying to sneak in a little work.
Okay? Forgive me for making a living.
But everybody else was participating. Everybody else doesn't pull down what I do every year.
Everybody else doesn't pull down what I do every year.
I had my family there and I was present and accounted for.
So now, you know, I would really appreciate a moment of peace and quiet, cause frankly I'm exhausted.
a moment of peace and quiet, cause frankly I'm exhausted.
Bonjour, Pierre.
Bonjour.
Comment allez-vous?
Bien, merci.
Et vous?
Ah, comme ci comme ça.
Okay, I got a great idea. Let's pretend that we're in a cave.
You know what, Nanny? What, Grove?
I love you best.
[Annie] The other nannies had warned me about this very moment,
the moment when you'll be tempted to break the cardinal rule of nannydom.
And yet, staring into those big, sad, searching eyes,
I simply couldn't resist.
I love you too, Grove.
Three little words made leaving this job 1,000 times harder. [Mr. X] Hear a thing I have to say!
I know that you work hard, I just think,
that if we're gonna have more children…
Well, maybe you should focus on the one you already have. 'Cause you can barely handle him as it is.
Why are you so cruel to me? Why?
-Why? -Why are you so cruel? Because I cannot take the additional pressure.
You know something? I think that I am going to go out to Chicago until this merger is finished.
Just stop it, will you, stop it. And I certainly hope that you're in a better mood when I come back.
Please, stop it. [Mr. X] All right?
If I come back!
Nanny.
This is yours, is it not?
No. No, I don't know what that is.
It was in our laundry.
It is not mine, it is not Mr. X's,
so it has to be yours, right?
Right?
Yes, it's mine.
Please don't leave your personal items lying around the house again.
I won't. I promise. I'm sorry.
Apology accepted.
I don't mean to be a control freak.
It's just that when Mr. X is in the middle of a big deal,
it can be very hard on me.
I understand.
How's Grayer doing?
Grayer?
He's fine.
He's great.
That's good to hear.
He really is a wonderful child, isn't he?
He's the best.
He's such a sweet- Okay, good night then.
[Mrs. X] Dear Nanny, I know it's Sunday and you requested a day off,
but I desperately need to sleep in.
I have a very long afternoon today tasting caterers for our benefit,
Conga for the Congo.
Please don't wake me unless Mr. X calls from Chicago.
And most importantly, find a way to keep the boy quiet.
Why don't they just muzzle the kid already? What's a muzzle?
Scrambled for you and Cheerios for the boy.
Mommy doesn't allow me to eat sugar cereal.
Cheerios are sugar free. Low in sugar isn't the same as sugar-free.
Grover, just eat it.
Is that caffeinated? Mommy doesn't use caffeine.
That's because Mommy sleeps till noon.
[Mrs. X] Perhaps it might be a nice morning to do something educational with Grayer,
like the Pissarro show at the Guggenheim.
Mommy said you're supposed to take me to her favorite museum, the Guggyheiny.
Well, since today was supposed to be my day off,
we're gonna go to my favorite, the Museum of Natural History.
Isn't that on the West Side? Yeah, so?
I'm not allowed to go on the West Side. That's a rule.
Well, today just happens to be break-the-rules day.
Hi. Two please.
Hey, you know what the biggest word in America is?
What? Antidisestablishmentarianism.
Hey, that's pretty good, Grove.
Actually, I know a longer word. There is no longer word.
Yes there is! Supercalifragilis ticexpialidocious.
Wow. What does that mean?
Come on inside. Let me show you.
The apatosaurus, formerly known as the brontosaurus,
is from a family of enormous herbivores.
Herbivores means vegetarian. Like Mommy, you know?
What's that over there?
That is the T-rex.
Is that one like Mommy too? Hmm.
I wish my ancestors made totem poles.
[Annie] Well, they did. That one looks just like you.
Well, that guy has a big… [Grover] And it's hanging.
Cool. What are they?
[Annie] They're a Matis family. They live in the Amazon.
[Gover ]Which one's the nanny?
[Annie] She has the day off. Things are different in that part of the world.
[Mrs. X] And Nanny, one last thing before you take the rest of the day off.
Do you think you could manage a quick shop for me?
I'll help. No, it's okay, Grayer. Don't.
Grayer, don't, don't! God!
Mommy!
What a mess.
Really, Nanny, I don't know why you didn't leave all this downstairs with Manuel to store.
I mean, am I supposed to have this lying around the apartment till the benefit?
No no no, of course not. I'm gonna bring it down to him right now.
There's no time now.
I need you to get ready for the Nanny Conflict Resolution Seminar at the Parents' Society.
I totally forgot it was this evening.
Mrs. X, I don't know if you remember,
but I was supposed to have the evening off, and I made plans.
The entire point of the seminar is that everybody brings their nanny.
Are you suggesting I attend it alone?
No. I was just…
I was confused. So, I will cancel my plans.
So, I will cancel my plans. I'd appreciate it.
Does anyone have an extra diaper I can use?
Stop eating them boogers!
Grayer, no nudity. Please.
Of course you feel anxiety when leaving your kids with strangers.
You're moms.
Okay, now what I would love to do is bring in the nannies.
Linda, Gillian, would you mind monitoring the children
so that the nannies can join us in here?
Okay, listen, I wanna see you all here next week.
The seminar is called sexy mom, happy mom.
It's gonna be a hot one.
Nannies, we're ready.
Right this way, ladies.
All right, here they are, the nannies! Wonderful. Come on in.
Just, file against this wall. Just squeeze in.
But be comfortable. Terrific.
Now that we're all together, I think it's time to address the reason for this seminar:
improving nanny -mom communication.
To begin, I would like a mom volunteer
to offer the group one particular example of failed communication with your nanny.
Most of them barely speak English. That's the problem.
Okay, you.
My nanny keeps on singing religious songs to Parker
even though I have told her time and time again that we're agnostic.
And what's worse, every time I confront her she flatly denies it, even after I provided her
she flatly denies it, even after I provided her with evidence from the Nanny Cam.
Nanny Cam? I thought that was an urban myth.
That's my nanny over there.
Will you please ask her if she's trying to convert my child?
No. Right now we're just hearing issues.
Okay. Next I would like to hear from a nanny.
Can I have a nanny volunteer? Anyone?
¿Por favor?
Come on, don't be shy. We won't bite.
Okay, how about you, young lady?
Me? Yeah, you.
Can you share with the group one particular grievance that you might have about your job?
Come on. No, no. No, I love my job.
I do. I feel kinda lucky. Oh, that's very nice, but neither helpful nor productive.
Oh, that's very nice, but neither helpful nor productive.
So can you please offer the class something useful? Come on.
Well… It would be nice to have a night off, I guess.
It would be nice to have a night off, I guess. A-ha.
We have been a little preoccupied with our benefit.
But all she has to do is ask. Uh-huh-huh-huh.
See, ladies? Conflict resolved.
-I'm taking him. -Oh no, I can take him.
No, it's all right. No, I can take him.
Nanny, please.
I want you to go out. It's only nine, you clearly wanted the evening off.
No, you must be exhausted, let me put him to bed. We'll manage fine.
Here. Have a blast.
I just don't understand it.
I just don't understand how someone can have everything and still be so miserable.
Anyway, remember I was telling you
I went to this orientation mixer thingy?
I met this guy who likes the same exact-
It's like she dumps all of her problems with her husband onto me.
It's called denial. Okay, like the river.
And you obviously have become her enabler.
What? What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means, Annie,  can you stop talking about this woman for five minutes please?
Well, I'm sorry I'm boring you, Lynette, but this is my life right now.
I have a life too, in case you haven't noticed.
And I'm starting to think you and that lady are kindred spirits.
You know what? NYU should give you your diploma right now.
You've got all the answers. Okay okay. Okay, let's forget that.
Okay, let's forget that. Forget that. Can we at least try to have a good time?
Since you did drag me above 14th Street. Mm.
Come on, Annie. This place, you have to admit, it's… Hmm, tired.
Look at these guys over there.
They don't have any piercings, no tattoos. I mean…
Oh my God. We have to go right now.
Why? Wait a minute. The guy I told you about is here.
Harvard Hottie? Mm.
Which one? Which one, where?
Yankees cap, blue shirt, blue blood. Mmm.
He is gorgeous. Yeah, okay, let's go.
No no no, are you out of your mind? You kidding me?
No, I'm out of my league, okay? Let's go. Oops.
What the hell are you doing?
Oh my God, I know that girl. Annie!
Annie! Come on, have a drink with him already.
I told you, I can't date on the job.
Are you gonna use this job as an excuse for everything or what?
Say hello to the nice fella.
Hey. Guys, this is Annie.
I don't know your name, I'm sorry. Oh, Lynette.
Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you. I'm with some buddies from high school.
This is Carter, Jojo, John, Kenny, Reggie. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. Sit, grab a chair.
-Oh no, we can't. -We'd love to.
So, girls, tell us, how do you know our boy here?
Oh, I really don't know him. He's Annie's friend.
I know him from work.
Oh, yeah? What kind of work do you do?
Model?
Stewardess? Escort?
She works for someone in my building. Oh.
Actually, I'm a nanny.
A nanny?
Dude! You didn't tell us you knew a nanny.
You didn't tell us you knew a nanny. That is so porno.
-Are the moms hot? -Guys.
Are you hot for the dads? Are the dads hot for you?
Hey, come on.
You wanna know about the dads? I'll tell you about the dads.
They're chubby, bald, steak-eating, cigar-smoking, type-A pigs,
[Annie] who get more turned on by the Bloomberg Wire than they do by any hot nannies.
Actually, it's all of you in about five years.
So take it from me, guys, enjoy tonight
because your future looks pretty fucking bleak.
Wait. God!
Stupid stupid.
[answering machine voice] You have two new messages.
[Harvard Hottie] Hey, Annie,  it's me, the big jerk from the bar.
What?
[Harvard Hottie] Listen, in case you're wondering, your friend Lynette gave me your home number.
Ex-friend. [Harvard Hottie] I obviously owe you a major apology.
Please just don't judge me by my loser friends. Mm-hm. They were pretty hammered.
Anyway, I want you to give me an opportunity to redeem myself by taking you out.
And I'm warning you, I won't take no for an answer.
I know where you live, so I'll camp out at your door if I have to.
You really might as well just get this over with. And if you really hate me after that,
I'll never ask you again.
Okay, I'm sorry to ramble.
If I don't hear from you, I'll ride the elevator til I find you.
Bye.
I am so screwed.
Annie,  it's your mother.
Look, I'm sorry that I didn't call last night, okay?
I had a really late night. But about tonight…
Okay, you know what, I don't wanna hear it.
I'm coming. I am coming.
All right, fine. Fine, okay?
Let me just call you after this play date, okay?
Play date? What the hell is a play date?
Oh shit. You said a curse!
You know, Mom. A play date.
It's the meeting of preliminary investment schedules.
Look, I'll call you later, okay?
All right. Bye.
Who lives here? Some kid named Jefferson.
Your mom found him with the Park Avenue play-date service.
Hi, y'all. I'm Jefferson's mama Tanya.
Come on in. We're baking a cake.
Oh my God.
Come on, boys! I pretend to be Jefferson's nanny.
But I was really hired to watch her. Yoo-hooo!
And this is what she's like after Betty Ford.
Doesn't her husband care?
He's 75. She's an ex-showgirl.
He's not complaining about anything.
Frosting fun! Yay!
I wanna come here every day.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
And what is all over you?
Annie,  will you tell me what the hell is going on?
All right, listen up, people. This is my apartment.
And my roommate Lisa is away on business.
You are, just visiting. He is-
Lynette's new boyfriend. Fine.
I love your friends. What twisted game are we playing here?
We're playing the my mom is coming over and if she finds out I'm a nanny then I'm screwed game.
I love it. Hey, should I whip up a fondue for Mom?
Well, you know what, if you're gonna play it straight, I would make it meatloaf.
I'm gonna borrow this. That's my dress. You can't borrow that dress.
It's a terrible dress.
Fondue? Go get my dress.
Oh boy, Calvin. Thank you so much. That looks delicious.
It's so festively presented too.
So, how did you and Lynette meet?
Annie's roommate Lisa introduced us.
It's a shame she's not here.
I used to date her too.
Really?
So, don't you just love Annie's new place? Mm-hm.
We do. We're here all the time.
Yeah, I think it's very interesting.
It's a little small, but… Mm. It's a fine steppingstone, honey.
It's work. I'll take that.
Well, certainly keeping her busy. Very busy.
Mm-hm. Busy bee.
[woman] Relentlessly. Round the clock.
Hello? This isn't a brontosaurus.
You don't know anything. Oh, Grayer!
Please! It is yoga hour and Mommy's on the phone.
Hello? Yes, hi. It's me.
I know that I agreed to let you visit your grandmother in the hospital tonight,
but I feel I need to remind you that tomorrow is Grayer's birthday.
What? How can that be? His party isn't until next month.
Well, we scheduled it that way on purpose
because the party planner I wanted wasn't available. Neither was my husband.
But as it turns out, Mr. X is coming home for two days from Chicago,
so we're planning a small family celebration.
Oh that's lovely. Grayer couldn't ask for a better gift.
And then afterwards, we'll all head over to the Carlyle
for a more formal affair with friends. Obviously, I do expect you to attend.
Obviously, I do expect you to attend. Okay, all right.
So you will need to dress appropriately. Right.
Anyway, since you are not around to help, I've taken care of everything.
Mommy, play! Thank you.
Also, some roses arrived for you.
Roses? Yes, very curious.
The card says, "Accept my apology, or else."
Oh, that's crazy Grandpa.
He didn't visit Grandma last night and we just let him have it.
Well, you know how Grayer is around pollen. So, I'll have to throw them out.
Annie? Oh, okay.
Well, you know, I am going to hang up because the pacemaker isn't on.
So I'll see you in the morning.
Oh gosh.
Honey? Yeah?
Are you okay? Mm-hm. Perfect.
Dessert?
[Mr. X] This is of vital importance, are you aware of that? I don't think right now is the time.
I don't think right now is the time. You have absolutely no idea how disappointed I am.
[Grover] Clowns are supposed to be funny.
Well, they're French clowns, Grove.
I hate them and I hate my birthday.
In order to clean up your mess! Do not interrupt me!
Now you told me that the extra year of preschool would guarantee him a spot.
Today he's six. What's your plan now?
I'll be back, okay? [Mr. X] We should try to be calm.
[Mr. X] We should try to be calm. My brother's kids got in.
That isn't enough of a humiliation. I will not tolerate at this point-
I will not tolerate at this point- There are mimes in the next room
and I suggest you keep your voice down. You know what?
Hey.
What the hell are you doing here? I wanna know why you threw my flowers away.
I found them in the stairwell. I didn't throw them away, okay? My lunatic employer did.
And if you don't get out of here right now, she's gonna throw me out too, okay?
she's gonna throw me out too, okay? Not until you agree to see me. What?
This has got to stop. Come on, one date. That's all I'm asking here.
Oh, fine fine, okay? After work on Thursday. Go go.
Nanny.
Before we head over to the Carlyle,
I would like you to know why Mr. X is so upset.
It seems that Grayer was rejected for admission to Collegiate.
I'm very sorry. That must be upsetting.
Not upsetting. Unacceptable.
Stop it! Get away from me!
Oh, sweetheart. Don't be afraid. They're only clowns.
I hate them. They're nice French clowns.
They scare me!
Grayer, go to your mommy. Huh-uh. Go to your mommy, Grayer, go.
No. Go on, sweetheart.
As I was saying, Nanny,
we feel that you are not spending enough time
on educational activities with our son.
Therefore we have decided to hire a consultant to fully research the situation.
He will demand extra time from you this week.
Whatever's best for Grayer. Starting Thursday evening.
Do you read to the child from The Wall Street Journal?
Financial Times? Granta?
I sing to him in French.
Well, we need more time than I thought
Well, we need more time than I thought to get to the bottom of this.
I know. I know, I'm very, very late.
I'm sorry. Did you get my message? Yep, all six of 'em.
I couldn't get out of work. The consultant kept me forever. It was horrible.
It was horrible. Yeah, well, not only did I lose the reservation, but the kitchen is now closed, so…
Okay. I'm sorry I was late.
Sometimes these things just don't work out, okay?
Wait, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Think you can just get rid of me that easily?
No, it's not about getting rid of you. It's just that no place around here stays open this late. That's all.
Actually, I know the perfect place.
Pretty good, huh?
Number one slice on the Upper East Side.
It's not bad.
I'll tell you what though, it doesn't touch the Jersey Shore.
Well, if you're such a pizza connoisseur, there's a really great place in Italian Harlem.
I'll take you there sometime. Harlem?
I have a hard time imagining you in Harlem.
Why? I enjoy exploring my city.
Something you should probably do more of.
Thank you. I'll try to squeeze that in between
cleaning up Grayer's vomit and picking up Mrs. X's laundry.
Come on, if your job is that bad, why don't you just quit?
I mean, it's not like you're on a career path here. I don't understand.
No, of course you don't understand.
You've obviously lived a very charmed life.
Growing up on Fifth Avenue. You went to Harvard.
A charmed life?
Okay. Now I get it.
You know, for your information, my mother died when I was four.
My father traveled constantly for work.
I was raised by nine different nannies
until I was old enough to get shipped off to boarding school.
That's how charmed my life was.
I'm really sorry. But you know something?
I still think I turned out to be a pretty decent guy in spite of it all.
I guess I'm officially an asshole.
Well, asshole is a pretty strong word.
I would have gone with jerk or bonehead.
But that's just my prep school upbringing.
I don't know, you know, I just… I would love to quit. I really would, but I…
I can't leave Grayer.
I can't.
You're gonna think I'm totally crazy, but I feel really bad for her also.
Do you think I'm crazy?
Well, you know, you could be suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. You ever heard of Patty Hearst?
Are you kidding? Yes.
But I do think you should probably let me kiss you right about now.
What?
Well, we're two blocks from your building.
And once we get any closer, I won't be able to go near you.
Which, to tell you the truth, is all I've really thought about since that day
is all I've really thought about since that day I saw you in that Betsy Ross getup.
That is really kinky and weird.
You don't know the half of it.
Good night. Good night.
Pleasant evening. Yeah.
Good night. Uh-huh.
Look out for the…
Sorry.
[Annie] While doing field work, anthropologists have been known
to lose themselves in the very society that they're studying,
a phenomenon known as going native.
When this occurs, the proper course of action is to remove oneself ASAP.
After my night with Harvard Hottie,
it became quite obvious that my obsession with the Xs meant I'd gone native.
with the Xs meant I'd gone native.
Daydreaming in the park that day, I came to the conclusion that the only right thing to do
was confront Mrs. X and quit.
Oh, I forgot about this. Wow.
This could work.
See if you can find me something short. It'll go better with this neckline.
Okay.
Did Grayer get you this?
God.
I bought this for my mother when I was 10.
She got mad at me, refused to wear it. She said it was common.
I think I saved it out of spite.
How about this?
Mr. X bought it for me for our first wedding anniversary.
So it's only fitting that I should wear it tonight, right?
Definitely.
Mrs. X, I need to talk to you about something.
I know you're really busy tonight, so I was wondering if we could schedule some time tomorrow night to talk.
What is it, Nanny?
I think it's better if we talk alone.
What is it?
Nanny, lend a hand.
Well?
You look amazing.
Really? You look very pretty, Mommy.
And you like the Dior?
I mean, I know it's a little much for dinner,
but afterwards he's taking me to the President's Circle Gala at the Met.
Well, I couldn't imagine a more perfect dress for a romantic anniversary.
All I need now is my husband.
I just called the airport.
There wasn't a single delay or cancellation out of Chicago, so…
Where can that man be?
Nanny, call La Grande Nuit and tell them we're running late.
Nanny, call La Grande Nuit and tell them we're running late. I don't wanna lose the reservation.
Is it Le Grande Nuit or La Grande… L-E… L-E-S?
I think it's L-A.
Thanks, smarty-pants.
Hello? [Mr. X] Yeah, it's me.
Listen, I'm losing cell service here.
I need you to find my wife and explain to her that my flight was canceled.
And since I'm gonna have to be back here Sunday night, I'm just gonna spend the whole weekend in Chicago.
No no no… [Mr. X] Make sure to tell her I'm sorry.
No no no, Mr. X, you can't do this. Look, she…
Nanny, who was it?
What did he say?
He said that his flight was canceled.
And he's very, very sorry.
Make sure you put that one on top. I don't want anything to wrinkle.
Mommy, where are you going?
Mommy, don't go! No, Grayer…
No, Grayer. Don't be difficult.
Mommy has to go away for a few days to get some rest.
Nanny, I've decided to take a few days off.
I'll be at the spa at Canyon Ranch in Lenox.
Maria has all my numbers. Oh God.
[Grover] Nanny, can we go upstairs?
I feel funny.
Oh my God! How did this come on so fast? 104?
Oh my God, oh my God. Okay, okay.
Honey, come here. You okay?
I'm so sorry. That's okay, that's okay.
All right.
Okay. Wait, no.
Hey, Lynette, it's Annie. Listen, I need your help.
Grayer has a temperature of 104 and I have vomit all over me and there's nobody here.
God. Did you call his mother? Yes, I called his mother. She's at some friggin' spa.
I left three messages and she won't call me back.
I don't know what to do. I mean, should I take him to the emergency room
or something? [Lynette] Annie, I can't answer that.
I…
Do you know a number of a doctor I could call for advice, or a nurse even?
Of course I know a nurse. Your mother.
[Grover] Nanny?
Lynette, I have to call you back.
What is it, sweetheart? What's wrong?
I want my mommy.
Me too.
How is everything?
His fever's down. But I think he's got the croup.
The steam should help open his passages
and hopefully it'll ease up his cough and he can get some rest.
Is there anything I can do?
Just close the door.
He's okay now. Much better. Oh, thank you, God.
Even so, you should bring him to the doctor in the morning. He's probably gonna need a prescription.
Okay.
Hey, Ma…
I don't know how to thank you for coming here, and helping-
Why'd you lie to me, Annie?
I have never lied to you. Ever.
I know.
I just…
Oh, Mom, I couldn't handle it anymore. -I just couldn't handle it. -What?
What couldn't you handle? You're young, you're smart, you're energetic.
You got this incredibly bright future ahead of you.
It was too bright, Ma. All right? I just, I got… I had to get away.
And do this?
You understand? Every night shift I worked, every overtime hour I accepted,
I did it because I wanted something better for you -[door closing] -than I had.
Nanny! Good, you're up.
Just leave that there.
So listen, the spa was just awful,
totally overrun with suburban riffraff.
And then in the middle of my body scrub, Mr. X called and believe it or not,
Mr. X called and believe it or not,
he wants to take us all to Nantucket next week.
So I figured I might as well cut my trip short and…
Who's this? I'm Judy.
It's my mom.
You never mentioned you had a mother, Nanny.
My mom's a nurse. She came over here to help me.
Grayer's been very, very, very sick.
I tried calling you… Where is he?
Well he's sleeping now.
Then he can't be that sick now, can he?
So listen, could you quickly unpack my luggage and just put everything in the laundry?
I'm exhausted and Mr. X is expected sometime before 9:00.
I will see you in the morning. Oh, very nice to meet you, Julie.
Oh, very nice to meet you, Julie.
Judy.
Call me when this phase of your life is over.
[Annie] I desperately wanted to yell out after her,
but it was like one of those awful dreams where I had no voice.
My desire to be an observer of life was actually keeping me from living one.
was actually keeping me from living one.
[man] Clearly, the woman's heinous.
You gotta quit. It's just that simple. I can't, all right?
I tried.
What if I made you a tempting offer?
I'm gonna go to my father's house in Southampton for a month.
I gotta take some time, figure out if law school is really right for me.
Why don't you join me? Do a little soul-searching.
We'd get the whole house to ourselves, won't cost us a cent.
We'll walk on the beach, we'll drink red wine, grill fresh fish.
That sounds like heaven. But what if this vacation can save their marriage?
But what if this vacation can save their marriage?
If I quit now, I'll ruin it and break Grayer's heart.
What about my heart? Do I count for anything?
Come on, say yes.
Be young with me in the Hamptons.
Don't go to Nantucket with the weirdos.
What do you say?
Not a chance in hell, is there?
I can take a hint. Come on, I didn't say no.
You weren't exactly screaming yes though, were you?
I'm starting to wonder if you're really selfless or just a little self-obsessed.
Thank you. Thanks.
I have to go.
Listen, if you change your mind, my offer stands.
We're going to 'Tucket! We're going to 'Tucket!
Guess what else? I'm getting a puppy.
Oh my God!
Daddy, Daddy, where's my puppy?
Been waiting for you right up in the car there, sport.
Isn't it wonderful? Mmm. A family trip has been long overdue. Mm.
Mm. Listen, I didn't want to say anything in front of Grayer, but the truth is, I can only stay for a few days.
They're really pushing me to finish up in Chicago.
You can't be serious.
You're not gonna leave us on this island alone. Okay, we'll talk about it later.
Okay, we'll talk about it later. ♪ But I'm holding on ♪
♪ I'm gonna be your number one ♪
♪ Oh no ♪ Hi. It's Annie. I haven't heard from you in a while.
You're probably in Southampton,
but I just wanted to let you know that my cell phone doesn't work here.
So if you wanted to call… if you wanted to call,
you probably have the number already on your cell phone,
but I will give it to you just in case.
It is 508…
Hello? Oh.
What, hello? Hello, Nanny?
I need to use this phone. Immediately.
Okay, so sorry.
Oh God. Nanny, we're going to the beach.
[Grover] When I grow up, I want enough money to build a real castle.
[Annie] Just remember, Grove, that money can't buy love.
[Grover] But Mommy pays you money and I love you.
[woman] Surprise surprise, dear.
Mother? My, you've gotten portly.
Hi, Grandma.
What the hell are you doing here?
Ask your wife. She's the one who requested I come.
Darling, I- Not that I need an invitation.
It is my house.
I just wanted your mother to be here for the news.
News, what news? What in the hell is going on here?
I'm having another baby.
[Mr. X] Virtually impossible! What exactly do you want?
And you invited my mother here so that I can't go back to Chicago.
[Mrs. X] One lousy week!
[Mr. X] You know something? You are an infuriating woman. You really are!
That's what you get for rejecting debutante season.
[Mr. X] Who asked you, bitch?
Can you look after the kids for a minute?
I'm the only nanny here. I just have to use the restroom. Hmm.
Make it snappy, dear. I'm on the last chapter. Oh, thanks a million.
Oh, thanks a million.
Oh. You look gorgeous.
[Mrs. X] Listen, I need some nanny advice. [woman] Okay.
[Mrs. X] To tell you the truth, I don't know what's gotten into her lately.
Well, I installed a Nanny Cam. So we'll soon see the truth. [woman] It might be time to let her go.
[woman] It might be time to let her go.
[Grover] I saw another one.
Make a wish, Grove.
I wish we could stay in 'Tucket forever,
Mommy, Daddy, you and my puppy.
Grove?
You know I…
I'm not gonna be your nanny forever.
I can't be.
That doesn't mean I'm not gonna always be your friend.
What, there's no OJ in the goddamned shit-shack?
Oh, I was just about to make some. Mm-hm.
Where's Grayer? Isn't he up yet?
He had a little trouble sleeping, so…
Concentrate? You have got to be kidding me.
All my money and I can't get fresh-squeezed? Come on.
We used it all at the party, so…
Hmm. Well then, why don't you and I take a little trip to the market and get us some, huh?
I'm not in right now. Leave it at the beep. ♪ Be the new one burn to shine ♪
Where's Grayer? With his grandmother.
And where, may I ask, have you been?
I just had to clear my head. Did you?
I imagine your unacceptable behavior has something to do with that boy in the building.
Nanny. I wasn't born yesterday.
He called several times this week.
He called? Why didn't you tell me?
I suppose I forgot.
It's really for your own good.
He's a little out of your league, don't you think? It couldn't possibly end well.
Clearly this isn't working out.
Mr. X has arranged for a taxi to take you to the ferry
and then for a car to pick you up on the other end.
Please don't… Please don't do this.
Not for me, but for Grayer.
Not until you and your husband work your problems out.
Don't you dare.
You stupid… You stupid girl.
As if you know anything about my life. As if you know anything about the real world.
All I got's 100. All right, you know what?
Just give me the change when you come back for my mother at some point, okay?
Keep 10 bucks for yourself, all right?
Nanny.
Here's your final payment.
I expect you to have all your things out of our apartment by the time we come back.
Just leave the keys with the doorman.
Grayer, I think you should take a nap. I'm certainly ready for one.
Nanny! Where are you going?
Nanny! Grayer.
Grayer. -Stay here. -Nanny! Here.
What are you doing? Take it, take it.
What? I can't tolerate the yapping. Grayer's too young anyway.
Nanny! Grayer.
Nanny, don't go! Grayer, sweetheart…
Nanny, wait!
Nanny! Grayer!
Nanny, don't leave me.
Nanny!
Grayer.
What?
Go ahead, puppy, do your business. Anywhere you like.
Good puppy!
Nanny Cam, Nanny Cam, where are you hiding?
Okay, lady, you want Nanny Cam?
I'll give you nannies gone wild.
And this is how the most significant confrontation in my life
happened with a teddy bear.
After the abrupt termination of my field work,
I took some time to make sense of all that I had witnessed.
During this period I read that critics of anthropology believe that just by observing a culture
believe that just by observing a culture you inevitably change it. -Mm! -Ow!
Hey. In the many times that I thought of Grayer,
I secretly hoped those critics were right.
This is a tape of my latest nanny disaster.
She was extremely problematic, to say the least.
She neglected Grayer. She drank. She even flirted with my husband.
I finally had to fire her for promiscuous behavior with a boy in the building.
This videotape shows her feeding my child peanut butter and jelly directly from the jar.
peanut butter and jelly directly from the jar. You know, I remember this nanny.
You know, I remember this nanny. She had a very peculiar attitude.
Let's watch.
You excited about going to Nantucket? Yes.
Okay, well, why don't you close your eyes and you can dream about building sand castles?
I love you, Nanny.
Good night. This must be the wrong tape. I've never seen this one before.
It's all right, just let it play out. We'll get something good.
It's a problem. Big problem.
Okay, Mrs. X, now it's time for a few simple child-care rules.
Oh, all right. The teddy bear has been compromised.
Slamming the door in your kid's face is not okay.
Spending more time on a benefit for kids you've never met
than you do with your own blood is not okay.
Going to a spa when your son has a fever of 104 and not answering emergency calls,
that officially makes you an unfit mother.
This is outrageous. Stop the tape.
No, this is clearly a disgruntled nanny.
We might have something to learn here.
Yeah, I know that you're really busy with your hair appointments and your Watsu massages
and your attempts to stay young so your husband won't leave you,
but here's an idea, why don't you try eating dinner with your child every once in a blue moon?
And a head's up here, lady. Try smiling once in a while.
People hate you!
As for you, Mr. X, who the hell are you?
Maybe you're asking the same about me.
I know you've noticed my ass, but you probably don't recognize my face,
so here's a little hint, okay?
I'm the one who's been raising your son.
Grayer is not an accessory. His mother didn't order him from a catalog.
Your son, your wife,
are people in your home,
human beings who are drowning in their desire
for you to just look at them.
You know, the truth is, I don't wish either of you harm.
If for no other reason than you having the profound privilege of being Grayer's parents.
the profound privilege of being Grayer's parents.
Grayer loves you.
He doesn't care what you're wearing
or what you buy him or what school he gets into.
He just wants you there.
That's it.
And time's running out, and he won't love you
And time's running out, and he won't love you unconditionally that much longer, so,
for your own good, don't miss out on getting to know him.
He's truly an amazing, amazing little person.
Excuse me. Of course.
It's a much tougher game out there for women.
Nature deals us some tricky cards.
Is that so hard for you to understand? No.
I don't know, Mom. I just…
So I guess you're not going into finance?
I don't think that having money makes it any easier. You know, I know that now.
You know, I know that now.
It's okay. It's your life.
Personally, I think you're making a big mistake.
But it is your life.
I want you to be happy.
Hey. Hayden.
[Annie] Oh, that's right. I forgot to mention his name is Hayden.
And once I finally let myself say it, it was a habit that was pretty hard to break.
It's going pretty good actually. There's more scholarships out there than I thought.
Why are you so late?
Because I have something for you.
It's from your former employer. What?
She cornered me on the 12th floor, figured I could get to you before she could.
I don't wanna read this.
Why don't I read it to you? Okay.
Dear Annie.
It's been several months since we've spoken.
Even so, the things you said on that tape haunt me every day.
And now looking back, I don't know what to say
except thank you.
-And I'm sorry. -[Mrs. X] And I'm sorry.
You were so right.
Of all my privileges, Grayer is my greatest.
I desperately needed someone to show me that.
You did. And for that, I owe you the world.
You may or may not be surprised to learn that I've left my husband.
Not out of the jar.
Try it.
Any man who made me feel desperate enough to feign a pregnancy wasn't worth fighting for.
to feign a pregnancy wasn't worth fighting for.
Isn't it good?
Yeah. Yeah, it is good.
[Mrs. X] So I'm pretty confident that in time we'll be getting along just fine.
Yeah, it's really good. It's really good.
Please know that I wish you all the best in life.
Sincerely, Alexandra.
P.S.
I'm happy to report that Grayer asks for you a little bit less every day and every night.
Come on. Okay. Let's get out of here.
Catching the Yankees game with my dad tonight. Sounds wonderful. Yeah.
[Annie] There's a popular belief amongst anthropologists
that you must immerse yourself in an unfamiliar world
in order to truly understand your own.
I've probably gotta get going soon actually.
See you later tonight, okay? Yeah.
I certainly hope so.
[Annie] In conclusion, I hope this field diary
[Annie] In conclusion, I hope this field diary has been illuminating for those considering
has been illuminating for those considering my application to graduate school.
It certainly has been for me.
[Annie] After a lost summer of being Nanny, I finally got to know Annie.
Thanks to a little man named Grayer,
I only had to trek across the Hudson River
-Over here! -Ahh, Mrs. Lopez.

Yeah, there’s a hook that– I can’t–
Cannes jury member Emil Dachevsky, the Russian film director,
explained that his son Stepan
was last seen on a train with a mysterious foreigner.
As soon as I saw him I thought, "He’s evil."
[Clay] Action!
Cut!
The guy with the video camera is fired.
-You’re fired! -Aah–
Going again.
-Are you ready? -Yep.
Action!
Cut! Cut, cut!
[Clay] My explosion!

Hello.
You saved my life earlier.

Isn’t she a beauty?
Oh... Dunlop.
I’m going to Cannes.
Cannes? Cannes? Cannes–

Oh, gracias.
So, you’re Spanish?
No?
What is that accent?
Wait. Let me guess.
You’re not Italian?
-No... -No?
No...
And you’re not Greek, no?
You are...
You’re Russian, yes?

My invitation to the Cannes Film Festival.

Oh, ah, oui, oui.
"Cut!" -"Cut!" -[laughing]
I have a small part in his film.
I’m going to be a big star. He says it’s his masterpiece.
I need the loo.
Sorry.
I never got on the bus.
I was with these cool guys.
I can’t wait to show this to Papa.
It’s amazing meeting your son like that.
Is she your girlfriend?
You’re full of surprises.
Are you going to marry her?
So does that mean you’re married?
Telephone! Papa!
-Allô? -Papa?
Allô?
Estelle, tell me you love me or it’s over.

Oh, my goodness, the premiere starts in an hour.
[announcer on p.a.] Bienvenue and welcome
to the 59th Cannes International Film Festival.
On the red carpet, Carson Clay.
Director of our premiere, Playback Time.
And jury member Mr. Emil Dachesvky,
attending today despite there being no news of his missing son.
-Oh... -Oh, no.
I’m going to get changed.
Fill her up.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Carson Clay.
This film is for all of us who hunger for truth.
For all of us who cry out in pain.
For those whose souls yearn to sing.
He says it’s a very good film.
...as pictures were released
of the Englishman believed to have abducted the son
of Cannes Film Festival jury member
Emil Dachevsky.
A positive ID of the boy was made at a service station yesterday.
The police now believe the man is traveling with a female accomplice.
the man is traveling with a female accomplice.
-[gasping] -A national manhunt has been launched
and stop-and-search procedures have been instigated right across France.
You are not a Russian.
No.
You are not this boy’s father.
-No. -You are English.
You know the whole of France is looking for you?
Now they look for me, too!
Who are you? Where are you going?
To the beach.
This boy’s father is a judge at the premiere of my film.
We take him there.
And the beach?
Forget the beach!
I have only one scene in this movie. I am not going to miss this premiere.
Not for you, not for the police, okay?
Now, do as I say.
Bonjour, monsieur. Bonjour, madame.
My daughter.
My mother.
Bonjour, madame.
Oh, gracias.
She’s Spanish.
Buenos dias, señora.
And very deaf.
Sir, we’re in a great hurry.
I don’t want to miss my premiere.
No problem. Leave it to us.
Come on, we find Papa.
Here you are, sir.
-It’s for one person only. -Oh, no!
-No, she’s my daughter! Please! -Leave her with Grandma.
Damn!
[Clay onscreen] What is life but a teardrop in the eye of infinity?
Together we lived... we laughed, we loved.
But you left me.
And now I walk this wilderness alone.
Merci, Madame.
[Clay onscreen] What use is a cop with a broken heart?
Without you, I am nothing.
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.
Nothing!
Stop!
Your pass, please, madam.
-Hey! Madame! -Come on!
The Romans lit fires in the skulls of their dead
so they might forget their past.
-[man snoring] -Wherever I look, I’m reminded our relationship is dead.
[man] Hey, you okay?
[Man] But, Boss...
You, stay. -You okay? -Me... Papa.
-You okay? -Me... Papa.
[Clay] On the outside, yeah.
But inside...
nothing.
[man] Debroques is making the drop.
Boss?
What’s going down, Boss?
It’s me!
Boss?
Do we go?
He’s cornered, Boss.
We know he’s in there.
Let’s do it.
Okay, Boss...
[echoing] Nothing.
-Hey! -Huh?
-The little boy! -Shh!
-[both gasp] -Oh, look, this is my scene!
[Clay] It’s winter now.
And the seeds of love lie deep within me.
Will spring ever come?
I thought by now I’d’ve met another.
-But... -Hi–
...it was not to be.
They cut my scene!
But I can show the world that you were once mine.
I can relive our time together.
Those precious memories that I yearn to forget.
Time slips through my fingers like sand.
The fires of our love have burnt out, and now there is nothing.
Nothing but a sky black with ashes.
I won’t forget you, your kisses like soft fruit.
Your laughter bursting into daylight like silver.
-[gasping] -Your smile like the curl of the sickle moon in the night sky.
Your luminous beauty, your goodness, your patience,
how you hung on my every word.
You are now in the arms of another.
Who is he, this man?
-[laughing] -Does he have poise?
Does he have grace?
Is he a lover or a fighter?
What powers does he have over you?
Do your eyes dance like fireflies in the night when he comes to you?
Does your body soften as your lips shape his name?
I can’t believe you’ve been so selfish.
-[gasping] -Open the door!
Open up!
You are consumed by love.
It’s Mr. Carson Clay.
How does he cast a spell over you?
Enchant you? Beguile you?
Why did you shut me out?
[Clay] Come on, come on!
Where is he?
Where’s the projectionist?
I struggled to survive.
When I look back on the darkest moments of our history,
I know that we would part.
Whose is this?
And that now, I must... -Huh? -...let you go.
We will know a deeper, -surer love. -[Mr. Bean groaning]
It begins fleetingly, but it deepens and endures.
It grows amidst all the strangeness of life.
It is a beauty we can always depend on.
It is the beauty of friendship.
Stop!
He stole my son!
No! He didn’t!
Where’s my son? Where is he?
He’s just here–
-Son– -Papa!
-Stepan! -Mama!
[Clay] A very strange thing happens when you’re making a work of art.
Sometimes you, uh, don’t quite see the elements coming together,
and then when it all comes together, there’s something magical, something organic,
there’s something magical, something organic, and such a thing happened today, and...
everyone said this wouldn’t work.
They said it was a terrible risk.
But I wanna keep on making films just like this.
The video/film combination. It’s something that’s really been done before,
-but not quite like this. -[Mr. Bean gasping] Uh, I’m glad the reception was so great,
Stop!
MAY 2002, SIX MONTHS BEFORE YAN'S DEATH
Know what "screwed up" means?
The first masseuse came in.
She looked like Sam's dog. So I asked for a replacement.
The new one was worse.
She was a dead ringer for Sam.
Just imagine, I simply couldn't stand that.
She dared to ask if she's pretty.
Of course I said no. And she clawed me.
So I called you.
That's what "screwed up" is.
And you wrecked the whole place. That's going to cost me a fortune.
So, if a masseuse is ugly, you're screwed.
How dare you swear at your boss?
Ouch. That really hurts.
Yan.
It's a small gig. Don't give me hell.
You complain that I give you no work, but crooks don't need to work.
If you want work, why not be a cop?
Know why I only take you under my wing?
It's because you're focused.
It pays to be focused. Look at Sam.
He's so focused, right?
As for what happened today, don't let Sam find out.
Since his wife died, he hates us horsing around.
Give me a break, would you?
Are you done talking? Go inside.
Hey, stop pushing me, officer.
People shouldn't be like that. A cop shouldn't be like that either.
-So are you going to tell on me? -Enough.
It's no big deal.
We always tell on each other. Are you going to tell on me?
Go to hell!
Cut it out.
How dare you attack your boss?
OCTOBER 2003, TEN MONTHS AFTER YAN'S DEATH
File number IO143.
Regarding the deaths of DPC27149, Wing-Yan Chan,
and DPC34689, Kwok-Ping Lam.
After investigation, IA has made the following report.
On November 26, 2002,
Senior Inspector Kin-Ming Lau of IA contacted undercover officer Chan.
Tipped off by Chan,
Lau toppled Sam Hon's drug operation
together with the West Kowloon OCTB.
60 dollars' worth of cocaine was seized.
On November 27, 2002, Lau met with Chan again
on the rooftop of Square Commercial Center.
Chan supplied intel on triad moles.
You can't get away.
Just wait and see.
So you're going to whack a cop?
I know all about you and Sam.
You have no choice. Come back with me.
Drop your gun!
-What are you planning to do? -Get away.
The aforementioned testimony was provided by Senior Inspector Lau.
The two CSPs and the Assistant Commissioner of the independent investigation committee unanimously believed the testimony.
of the independent investigation committee unanimously believed the testimony.
Lau's killing of the CIB officer, Kwok-Ping Lam,
has been ruled legal.
It has been confirmed that Lam was a mole sent by Sam Hon.
It's over at last.
You guys believe me?
It's all over, right?
Stay in Admin for now. Okay?
Wait.
Got it. Your parking space.
Wait three more weeks.
Officer Chan.
Please wait.
Your uniform is ready. Drop by when you're free.
If not, I can send it to you. Sure, no problem.
Good.
Too bad Lam destroyed the CCTV.
Or it wouldn't have dragged on so long. Our bosses harp on about accountability.
It's lucky that we work together. So no red tape.
You can come back to IA next month.
Exhausted?
Take a vacation with Mary.
Hello?
Okay.
I'll sign the papers tomorrow.
Sure.
Yes.
Everything can be divided up.
Okay.
Everything except the baby!
Officer Chan, your uniform's ready.
If you're not free, I can send it.
I can do that too.
Okay, wait for me. Bye.
Have I done something wrong?
I feel like beating people up today.
Why make such a scene, SP Yeung?
These Taiwanese gangsters are arms dealers.
Their client didn't show up.
They're bored, so I'm keeping them company.
-Nothing wrong, huh? -Sure.
I work in the Security Wing.
I hate guys coming here all dressed up.
You've got so many men. Lend me a hand.
Don't give me a hard time.
That should make it easier.
Are you trying to set me up?
Is it better now?
We've already written the report.
Half a kilo. Minimum eight to ten years.
Ask the two kids to come back with me.
Here's what they're going to say.
They saw them take out some drugs.
As good guys do, they beat them up.
I'll give them Good Citizen Awards.
How about that?
Sounds good.
Take them in.
Not too rough.
Sir. Sir, you can't go in.
Keep out of the way.
Keep down.
Yeung, don't go too far. I've helped you a lot.
You want me dead?
If I go down, you'll go down with me.
Give me a chance, would you?
ONE MONTH LATER
Delivery from OCTB?
I was transferred to IA yesterday, along with the coffee.
Sit down.
I've stopped drinking.
Lately, I need pills to sleep. If I drink coffee, I can't sleep.
Life is so unpredictable.
I used to hate IA the most.
And now I have to work here.
You don't seem to like it here. I can transfer you elsewhere.
Are you kidding?
I moved here because of you.
The files are on your desk.
The first file.
This sarge killed himself in front of his ex-boss, Yeung.
IA is working on several big cases.
Security deals involving politics.
Everything is classified.
No matter what you're investigating, they won't answer any questions.
But we found an envelope on the sarge's desk.
There was a tape inside.
It's a chat between him and Sam.
It turns out that he, Chun Chan, was Sam's mole too.
Besides him, several officers also committed suicide or vanished.
They have been proven to be Sam's moles.
It is suspected that after Sam's death,
a mole wants to clear his name and kill everybody else.
SP Leung has ordered us to find this guy as soon as possible.
It was a close shave this morning.
A package was delivered to SP Leung. Guess what was inside.
Tapes of us supplying intel to Sam.
It's lucky that the sarge is a mole. How many more are there?
Including you, there are five.
Ronald, this is Inspector Lau.
I've left something at Admin.
Hello?
I've dug up something about Chun.
He was in the police bowling team.
Wait.
-Inspector Lau, here's what you need. -Good.
-I'm off to lunch now. -Thanks.
Go on.
He used to go to SCAA for practice.
The company from which he rented his place owns three big units.
The owner is Cheng Shen, a Mainlander. I'll email you the details later.
No, send them to me now.
LUNGKING GARDEN, BROADCAST DRIVE, AND 39 COLLEGE ROAD
Inspector Lau.
I'm Yeung from Security Wing.
I applied for a parking space.
Let me check.
I waited a whole month.
I don't want to push you, but how much longer will it take?
Sorry, but I've moved back to IA.
I know. Admin asked me to contact you.
Your application was approved last month. Look.
Here, your parking space is at B3A6.
We couldn't reach you.
I've taken a month off. IA was investigating me.
-You should know that. -I do.
Well, investigating Admin today?
No. Just picking up a uniform.
It's a sarge's uniform, Inspector.
It belonged to the sarge who killed himself in front of you.
I'll take it back for investigation.
Wasn't the case closed?
True, or your break wouldn't be over yet.
-Thanks. -You're welcome.
Have we met before?
No, we haven't.
Do you know Cheng Shen?
No. Mind your own business.
Inside Chun's locker, we found these photos.
This guy is Cheng Shen.
He used to be Sam's business partner.
This other guy is SP Yeung, the Head of Security Wing.
I think he is responsible for the sarge's death.
SP Leung could be Sam's man that we're searching for.
CHENG SHEN, SAM HON
Hello?
Okay. See you in an hour.
WING-YAN CHAN
You're so nice.
You see him once you're back.
You're a nice guy too.
Thanks to you, he could die as a cop.
That's my duty.
I don't know why I helped him.
I only knew him for five months.
I've seen him 21 times in total.
HE SACRIFICED HEROICALLY. MAY HIS NOBLE SPIRIT ENDURE.
He was a good cop.
Anyone would've helped him.
Where are you going? I'll take you.
Yes. I'm back.
Let's start.
There are no triads in China.
What China needs is wealth.
Triads are all life-and-death. Business is all about wealth.
Today, we're here to talk business.
But I'm a real triad guy.
To me, you're the best businessman. My brother said so, too.
We have a hundred million to spend. We want to invest in your business.
We'll ask no questions.
It's one country, two systems.
As long as money breeds money, we'll let you run the show.
You still believe in that?
We believe in our Mainland ties.
You think a Hong Kong triad can outlive a Mainland businessman?
Without my brother's connections, your business in China won't last.
Sam, you're a Buddhist, right?
Glory to Amitabha.
Is the feng shui good here?
The best in Hong Kong.
I want a longevity gravestone here.
For which member of your family?
For my wife.
She died half a year ago.
And also for myself.
Such a small job, I'll handle it.
-A small job? -A small job.
A small job.
If that's the case, let my men do it.
We'll see how they handle it.
Goodbye!
Bye!
-Keung. -Huh?
You'll deal with his men.
Are you kidding, boss?
I'm an idiot. I will mess it up.
What does this smile mean?
Excuse me.
Thank you.
WING-YAN CHAN
So loaded.
Jealous or what?
Is it legit? Be careful.
Don't worry, boss.
You should know how much cash I have.
Want a loan?
What's this?
Your daughter's pocket money.
You're a dad. Spend more time at home.
You sure look thinner lately.
None of your business. Thanks.
Who are these two guys?
I only know they're Mainlanders.
Anything else?
Shen was born in Taiyuan, Shanxi. An entrepreneur who was drafted.
Dealt in antiques and transport. Started from scratch, now he's loaded.
He came to HK a year ago.
His brother, Liang, joined him recently and is involved in shady businesses.
Sam's been eyeing the Chinese market.
-He wants you to talk about what? -Co-operation.
-Liang. -Chan.
Sit down.
-By yourself? -You too, Liang?
We have lots of nightclubs in China.
All protected by local big shots.
Big shots.
Your goods can circulate in our network easily.
We have businesses in 11 cities.
I'm sorry.
-Hello? -Well, how's the talk so far?
Not bad.
See an ashtray in front of you?
Pick it up and smash it over his head.
Smash him.
Smash his head.
I'm screwed.
-What happened? -Mary is pregnant.
-Congratulations, boss. -But we're not married yet.
-Get married then. -Huh, is it necessary?
-Or she can have an abortion. -We're already engaged.
Hello?
Got it.
-We can go now. -Okay, let's go.
SP Wong, long time no see.
But I saw you last week in China with a broad.
You don't have to shout.
Security people are full of secrets.
Time for a break.
-Enough! -Stop taking photos.
Hey, what's going on?
What are you doing here?
Sorry, SP Wong.
We were asked to take some mug shots. I don't know what's going on either.
I asked CIB to open a file
and take a picture of everyone. Anything wrong?
Officers, are you done?
Wow, everybody's here.
We were on the trail of Mr. Shen.
But that led us to Mr. Hon by chance.
We even busted his men.
I'll let CIB handle the triads.
Sam, long time no see.
What brings you here?
Just accompanying some friends.
You Hong Kong Police are so inefficient.
I'll speed it up then.
He beat you up. Want to press charges?
If not, then sign here.
I beat you up. Want to press charges?
-You're mad. -Stay put.
Keung, let's go.
Wait.
Do you recognize me?
But I recognize you. Be careful.
SP Wong.
They're all yours.
No need. We know each other so well.
You guys from the CIB, you can go now.
-Thanks, Lau. Thank you. -It's my duty. Let's go.
What's your game?
You think it's a game?
-It's life-and-death. -Well, you know that.
-Hurry up and thank me. -For what?
-Look what you're doing now. -Just eating.
You're eating shark's fin.
That's shark's fin.
The boss took me to Thailand last time. I had shark's fin and then I got promoted.
You're having shark's fin. You'll get promoted.
Nonsense.
What? The boss is mean, but he buys you shark's fin.
Just think about it.
Take him.
Stop! Let go of him!
What are you looking at?
Boss.
You let them take Yan to China?
Ask him why he smashed his head.
He smashed his head?
It's no big deal. On the street, either you hit me or I hit you.
He smashed his head?
How about this?
Is it okay now?
Liang Shen.
Are you here to make a scene?
Or are you here for business?
Scram.
Scram!
We are even now.
Let's talk business.
I heard your arms business is huge.
If you can let me chip in,
then the blood they have spilled will not be in vain.
Boss.
What?
Holding a grudge?
No.
Ever met a guy who seems nice
but might whack you at any moment?
I've met someone like that before.
So what's your conclusion?
I'm wondering...
why he didn't whack you.
You deal with the Mainlanders from now on.
Take this.
Shen's not what he seems. Security is on his trail.
Could be related to arms smuggling.
Sam stopped all his deals in China. They're going to work together soon.
That's something big.
What should I do?
You're not at the shrink yet?
-Why should I see a shrink? -You beat people up.
I persuaded the Department of Justice to send you to a shrink instead of jail.
It's fine if you don't want to go. See you in jail.
Hello? What's the address?
Okay. Bye.
I have an appointment with Dr. Lee. Over there, please.
Hey, planning to spend the night here?
I can't fall asleep in my clinic.
Unlike him.
He said, since he went undercover,
he could only fall asleep here.
I still remember.
He told me that night,
"Everything will be okay after tomorrow."
And then he died.
You're a doctor.
What is it?
You still keep his file?
He's dead, but he's still a patient.
-Let's go. -Okay.
THREE HOURS LATER
We found an envelope on the sarge's desk.
There was a tape inside.
It's a conversation between him and Sam.
It is suspected that after Sam's death,
a mole wants to clear his name and kill everybody else.
I think he is responsible for the sarge's death.
SP Yeung could be Sam's man that we're searching for.
Do you understand what I said?
Sorry.
I won't sign it if she doesn't show up.
Got it?
My wife is divorcing me.
Did I scare you? I'm sorry.
-Be careful. -Of what?
Your car's next to mine. I drive badly.
If I scratch your car, look for me.
I'm a good driver. Don't worry.
The Taiwanese guys will be discharged next week. Taiwan authorities aren't commenting.
Mainland's police will come for repatriation.
Their boss is a good friend of mine.
So stick to the plan and be discreet.
When those big shots arrive, banquets and shopping are inevitable.
Make sure they feel welcome.
How about the nightclub?
I think Macao is better.
-You're not afraid of paparazzi? -Just put bags over their heads.
-Okay, you bring the bags. -You're so cheeky.
SP Yeung. It's Chun's memorial next week.
We want to hire some monks for a service.
Make sure it's decent.
Back to the Mainland police. Talk to the Macao people tomorrow.
Let them plan the evening.
I'll talk to them about security.
Without planning, it'll be a mess. Then we won't have a good time.
Any additions to your testimony?
No.
Call us if you need anything.
Thanks.
-All set? -Yes.
-Can I touch this? -Yes.
-Okay, thanks. -No problem.
Is everything okay?
It was like this when I came in.
They stole some cash and watches.
And the computer is gone.
Might as well start from scratch.
But the computer's useless to them.
I locked it with my password.
They won't know it's my license plate number.
Your eyes are red. You didn't sleep?
I've been working on several cases.
You should get some sleep.
Everything will be okay after tomorrow.
I have to go. Call me.
Mr. Chan.
AUGUST 16, 2002, THE FIRST SESSION
Mr. Chan, I'm Dr. Sum-yee Lee.
I am obligated to tell you you're ordered to undergo treatment.
In the next six months, you should complete the treatment.
I'll then submit a report to the Court.
The Court will use this report to decide if you should go to jail.
Jail?
Isn't the treatment all there is?
You should follow the doctor's orders.
Or the Court can revoke the sentence
and detain you until another sentence is passed.
Got it.
Damn you, SP Wong.
You don't need to call the cops. Just give me a call. You have my number, right?
Or I'll become a wanted criminal.
THE SECOND SESSION
Mr. Chan, I'm Dr. Sum-yee Lee.
I am obligated to tell you you're ordered to undergo treatment.
In the next six months, you should complete the treatment--
You'll then submit a report to the Court.
The Court will refer to this report and might put me in jail. I got it.
Please sign here, then.
We think you have a violent streak.
We'll use hypnotism for treatment.
Hypnotism?
You signed the papers.
Hypnotism?
You can refuse.
But the Court can revoke -the sentence-- -And lock me up, right?
Go ahead.
Hypnotize me then. Go ahead.
Let's begin.
Please introduce yourself.
Talk about your family.
Mr. Chan?
Mr. Chan.
Can you co-operate?
I was practicing.
In case you can't hypnotize me, I can hypnotize myself for you.
You know, my will is particularly strong. It's not easy to hypnotize me.
I haven't started yet.
Not yet.
You want to know my story?
My surname isn't Chan.
I'm an illegitimate child.
My dad was a drug pusher.
I've had to work since I was little.
I earned 200 grand a month. I bought a Porsche at 17.
I hired two drivers because I didn't have a driver's license.
This shrink thing is a pain.
Shrink or jail time. You choose.
She wants to hypnotize me.
If I spill the beans because of that, don't blame me.
It's not that easy to be hypnotized. Don't concentrate and she'll fail.
It's tough not to concentrate.
Dr. Lee is...
a nice person. You won't understand.
Right. You are looking at the sky with lots of cloud.
Right. You are looking at the sky with lots of cloud. THE THIRD SESSION
You are enveloped by warm water.
You feel weightless.
You're floating on water.
You slowly open your eyes.
The sky is so close.
Then--
What are you doing?
I'm hungry.
I've got to eat something.
-Are you done? -Yes, kind of.
Let's start again.
Can you see the sea?
You're in water. The water is so warm.
It envelops your body.
You feel weightless.
You have so many tricks.
Not really. I might oversleep during hypnosis.
Better set my alarm.
It's not difficult to remember.
One Mercedes to Zhanjiang. One Land Cruiser to Zhuhai.
Write it down if you can't remember.
Hello? The cabin cruisers need new motors. Second-hand ones won't do.
Pink? We are smuggling, not sailing.
My fax number is 21918125.
No fax machine? Then why ask my fax number?
E-mail?
E-mail address?
No e-mail.
Sorry, but I've been really busy.
So are you done with your business? Let's talk about your family.
You said your dad had three wives, you have 16 sisters.
Let's talk about your 12th sis.
Wait.
Are you okay?
-Get away. -Why so impulsive? I haven't listened.
Better now?
The report for the Court
doesn't matter to me.
I'm a doctor. I only want to cure you.
You can leave anytime if you like.
But I've been trying to tell you.
If you keep lying, I can't help you.
THE... SESSION
Dr. Lee.
What did I do besides sleeping?
You don't remember what you did?
I do, but I'm not sure.
Forget it. Bye.
Dr. Lee.
You're particularly nice to me.
-You've got a crush-- -Delusion.
Delusion?
No wonder.
What's with you? You're so smug.
The doc said you're dying tomorrow?
You won't understand.
Do you think I am delusional?
Delusional? Yes, you are.
Maybe hypnotism makes me delusional. Dang.
What happens is-- Hey, watch out.
So many cars.
What happens is that woman makes me all confused. Then I spill my guts.
That's not the case. It has to do with Sigmund Freud.
According to psychoanalysis,
hypnosis gets to your subconscious.
Once it reaches your subconscious, it can reach your dark side.
Then it can heal your traumas, and then with symbolic memories--
It's so deep. Are you showing off?
I can't help it. It's written in Shen's Reader's Digest.
-Are you buddy-buddy with Shen now? -Not at all.
He tries to be buddy-buddy with me instead.
Mr. Shen.
Mr. Shen.
Let me apologize for Yan. I'll apologize for him.
Pal, ever heard the saying,
"Men are changed by events, not events by men"?
No discord, no deal. Without the past, there's no present.
I'm sorry.
What?
Great speech.
-Where's Sam? -He sent the two of us.
Sam.
Reading?
-Any recommendations? -How about you?
-How To Become Rich In One Day. -I'm not short of cash.
I helped you a lot over the years.
You speak first, Chief Inspector.
You know everything I know already.
Cut the games. Will you help me?
You help me. I help you.
We help each other.
Good.
What are you doing here?
I am here to--
He's gone.
Who's that guy?
A pimp.
Why are you following him?
I'm a pimp, too. I want to know if he's involved with my gals.
Actually, I'm short of cash.
If you don't mind, you may consider hiring me.
Be serious, doc.
Be serious, pimp.
-Hello, Internal Affairs. -Boss, I saw Yeung with Sam today.
He may be a mole. Run a check on him.
Sam's deal with Shen may start soon.
Hello?
-Uncle Chan, why so late? -Refilling the water dispenser.
You're good. You know when we run out of water.
Don't just talk. Give me a hand.
Damon, help him out.
Let me help you. Let me.
-Hello? -Why say nothing just then?
Yan just sent me a tape.
Yan sent you a tape?
Wait for me.
-What's wrong with you? -I'm busy.
-Wait. -What?
You've been back for two days.
You haven't seen anybody but me.
Am I supposed to greet everyone?
Did I scare you?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why you locked yourself up.
But no matter what, don't take everything on yourself.
Everything will be okay after tomorrow.
Lau.
The door is over there.
RETURN ADDRESS: WING-YAN CHAN, PO BOX 27149, CENTRAL POST OFFICE
Let's give it to OCTB.
Did you listen to it?
No.
Sam will deal with Shen in two days. There'll be lots of arms and coke.
I'll contact you before take-off.
So Sam doesn't trust you fully.
Beware of Yeung.
I will.
Can you bust him?
You saw them together. That's not enough. How can I bust him?
Boss, I'm risking my life for you. So don't give me that crap.
I'll take care of Yeung.
It's you?
Don't worry. Lau's a great help.
What? You screwed up because of him.
It was an accident.
Didn't you want us dead?
I only want to be a good guy.
Can you give me another chance?
Sorry, I'm a cop.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
Do you know what you just did?
I know. What about it?
-Can you take me back to the clinic? -Sure. Are you okay?
Okay. Let's go.
Good morning, Dr. Lee.
Your hypnosis is great.
I'm so relaxed.
I guess I won't need to go to jail.
Hypnotherapy is a two-way process.
If you don't tell the truth,
-I can't help you. -I'm already very co-operative.
You don't talk about the triads. That's okay. But even on matters
You don't talk about the triads. That's okay. But even on matters like your favorite films and food,
you still have to lie.
Well, that beats me.
You're not me. You won't understand.
The brain is not made for keeping secrets.
I remember when I was a kid,
I was stealing a candy bar in a supermarket.
It was a foot-long. Family-sized.
The manager caught me at the cash register.
I was so scared, I cried.
The manager finally let me go.
Later, I went there with my mom. And I saw the manager.
I felt him staring at me. I was very uneasy.
My mom asked me what was wrong.
I said the manager had molested me.
My mom called the cops. So the cops took the manager away.
He never told on me.
But I never saw him again.
Then I went to college.
I finally told this to a classmate.
After I finished telling the story...
I felt like a newborn.
Can I really start over again?
Do you trust me?
-I do. -I do.
As long as you trust me.
When did you join the triads?
I didn't want to join the triads.
I wanted to be a good guy.
But then I met Mary.
Your wife?
She was Sam's woman.
Why do I have to talk about this?
You have got to trust me for hypnosis to work. Then we can solve your problems.
You can't solve my problems.
My job is to betray folks around me.
I don't know when to stop.
To survive,
I have to betray others.
I'm actually a cop.
I'm a cop.
I don't want to be Sam's mole.
Did I scare you?
I'm sorry.
Don't worry. Everything will be okay after tomorrow.
Where were you? Today is D-Day.
-Today? -Yeah.
-I forgot. -Hand over your phones.
Distribute them.
Yan.
You take the boat. Be careful. There are arms.
-You could be killed at any time. -I know.
-You drive me to the dockyard. -Okay.
Shen and Sam's transaction will take place tonight.
They might have an armory. Prepare bulletproof vests.
The Marine is standing by. Team A and B, get ready at the slopes. Wait for my order.
The operation is called off.
What are you saying?
That's an order from the top.
An order from you or from the top?
I don't need to explain it to you.
I've been on Sam's trail for years. Explain your ties with Sam.
It's a Security Wing top secret matter.
You can make a formal inquiry to the Assistant Commissioner.
Call IA.
-Just do what Yeung said. -No way.
Wong, it's not as simple as you think.
It's very simple to me. My man is risking his life out there.
Everybody in OCTB stays put. You're under disciplinary investigation.
What kind of disciplinary issues?
You don't follow orders. That's a disciplinary issue.
Where are you going?
Back to my room, sir.
Let's go.
-Tang. -Yes.
-Turn back. -Okay.
Ask everyone to follow our car.
Boss, but Yan is at the exchange.
-Hello? -Mr. Lau.
Your wife has agreed to meet you this afternoon. Is that okay?
Thank you.
The Mainland officers will come in today for repatriation.
Make sure nothing goes wrong. Be cautious.
Damon and Fai, stay here.
Set the channel to 34879, okay? Tell Transportation we can go now.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Lau, having fun in my office?
Everybody, get ready and follow me.
-What's the matter, Lau? -We'll bring the Head of Security in.
Those officers are chatting inside. They'll be meeting our boss in 15 minutes.
Don't fall asleep this time. Damon and Fai, get the documents ready.
Mr. Kam-wing Yeung.
You're under suspicion of colluding with Sam. Please come with us to IA.
Lau, do you know what you're doing?
I know.
I found a cassette tape.
What tape? I don't get it.
Listen and you will.
Where's Mr. Hon?
He's not here yet?
They're empty.
Boss!
Boss, the arms cost over 10 million. Please give them back.
Those Mainlanders are animals.
-What if they're here to set me up? -Which jerk told you that?
My life told me so.
What if you're wrong?
Then I'll cooperate with them.
So Yan's going to die either way.
We're all risking our lives here.
I almost died twice.
Boss, no more jokes.
Boss!
I only have one henchman. Don't do this to me!
Tell me.
Where are my goods? Where?
Go ask Sam yourself.
Why?
Why didn't you shoot me in the head?
I didn't aim.
Stand up.
Stand up!
You guys are together?
You guys are together?
Sorry, I'm a cop.
Go ahead and shoot.
Save me a bullet.
What kind of cop are you?
As a cadet, I got an "A" for writing reports.
After I kill you two, I can write anything.
He's not Sam's man.
Then you're not Shen.
You're in time.
Come join us. It's entertaining.
So you don't want to help me, Lau?
I do, but they're watching me.
So you're not worried about me. You are worried about yourself.
Whatever you say.
You'll deal with him.
Okay. Give me three days. I'll run a check and contact you.
Inspector Lau.
Lau, this is your last chance.
Lau, you're under arrest.
-What are you doing? Lau is over there. -You're under arrest.
We agreed to bust him. Why help him?
-Yeung found this tape in your room. -Boss. Why did you make such a scene?
He was following me. One of us would have to die.
I'm now in charge. I'll look after your deal.
We got the goods while they were killing the cop today.
Cuff him.
What are you doing?
-Get away! Sit down! -Calm down.
-Get away! -Let's talk.
-Inspector Lau. Calm down. -Get away!
What are you doing?
I told you to be careful.
Why should I be careful? Why should I? I'm a good guy. Why should I be careful?
Why?
I worked so hard.
Helping you guys.
Killing all of Sam's moles. Why can't you give me a chance?
Why can't you give me a chance? I want to be a good guy too.
I want to be a good guy too!
Why don't you give me a chance? Why? Answer me!
Sorry, I'm a cop.
Sorry, I'm a cop.
I'm a cop too.
Sure you two won't go to the hospital?
People like me can't see the light.
Same here.
More blood, more credit. Will that cause you trouble?
It's just a report.
You trade intel with Sam. Be careful.
You should be careful. Sam set you up.
You won't bump into me every time.
Will we see each other again?
-I'll pass. -Speak Mandarin.
I'll go to Beijing next week. Join me.
I'll quit after this.
And you?
I'm a snitch. We don't have holidays.
Okay.
See you.
What's your name? You haven't told us.
Name? I don't know. Just call me "Shadow."
How corny.
About time for me, too.
You haven't answered me.
I asked if you remembered me.
At the cadet school in 1991.
If you hadn't left, I couldn't have gotten the award.
Lau is in critical condition at the hospital.
The bullet penetrated his upper jaw and entered his brain.
The doctor says even if he survives, his brain will be seriously damaged.
Stuff about him and the moles is all over his walls.
The whole IA has been covered with CCTV.
All connected to SP Yeung's computer.
Hello?
Mary.
He won't make it.
DECEMBER 2002, TEN DAYS AFTER YAN'S DEATH
He's dead. What's the point?
There are things we've got to do.
Hey, pal, you're right.
Dr. Lee. Everything will be okay after tomorrow.
I'll arrest Lau myself.
ONE MONTH LATER
Take it back.
He gave me a limp.
Is he Yan's friend too?
They were in cadet school together.
TWELVE YEARS BEFORE
Now that you're in cadet school, you will follow the rules.
Those who break the rules will be like him.
They will be expelled. Who wants to trade places with him?
Yeung, congrats on the award.
If he hadn't been kicked out, it should have been his.
Perhaps that's fate.
Destiny is destiny.
Men are changed by events, not events by men.
But these two men...
have changed certain events.
Let bygones be bygones.
Tomorrow is another day.
SEVEN MONTHS LATER
You're here?
The baby can say "papa."
He shot me so I shot him back. I was just a punk at that time.
-Stop bitching and learn from Yeung. -Learn what?
How to write a report.
-Did you kill anyone? Big trouble! -So it's no big deal if I got killed?
Send me a report.
I'll send you crap.
What did you say?
-Scram. -What do you mean?
-Time for lunch. -I hardly finished breakfast.
Then have lunch. Do you want to bite the dust instead?
Excuse me.
-Excuse me. -May I help you?
Can I try this stereo?
KSITIGARBHA SUTRA: "People of the like shall be cast into the Continuous Hell
Ah, it's nothing.
Does Jenny know?
I'm the man of my house, Tom.
I don't have to hide things from my wife.
I won't tell on you.
I appreciate it.
Try this.
Nicotine's not your problem.
It's your oral fixation.
You just need something else to suck on.
I read it in some magazine.
-What kind of magazines you been reading? -Easy.
A man's gotta be able to have something of his own.
How many shooters you count?
Five, six.
Somebody tipped 'em off.
All I know is, we just lost two whole fucking years of work.
Wanna take a look?
As long as it's just a look.
On three.
Three.
Son of a bitch.
Wait. Tom, backup's on its way.
-Oh! -FBI! Freeze! -Tom! Jesus Ch-- -[gunfire]
No!
John! You all right? Yeah.
Come on. Let's get you…
[John] Did you get him?
[Tom] I got him.
You sure?
He took one in the face.
He's dead. Relax.
Hey, the morgue's full of people who thought they got that son of a bitch.
What are you talking about, John? You sound like you know this guy.
Ah… there's talk the Yakuza hired a rogue independent contractor
to deal with the Triads.
He's supposed to be the best.
Same guy the CIA used in Jakarta that time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Same guy that turned on his handlers
and then killed three agents.
I heard it was five.
It's a bullshit story, John. You know that. All right?
Rogue's a phantom. He's a myth.
Somebody at the agency's yanking your chain.
Titanium shells, depleted uranium bullets.
It's his signature.
Do you really think Rogue was working for Yakuza?
That's the trouble with this business.
You never know who's working for who.
[Man] This is the San Francisco police.
Remain where you are with your hands in the air.
Yep. He's right here.
He's right here, John.
Hey. Yeah. See you soon. Okay. Bye-bye.
[in Chinese] You tell him he cannot smoke in front of the kids.
If he's going to smoke he can do it in the yard.
Hao. [in English] Okay.
Okay.
[in English] I thought he was quitting, anyway.
I thought he was, too.
[John] Yo, Tom. Ohh!
-Gotcha! -Aah! Daniel. Please.
-Honey. Darling, I'm on the phone. -Daniel, come on.
Better be on the road. Game starts in 30.
I'm running a little behind.
Figure if we don't hit traffic, we'll make it up there by halftime.
John.
It's an oral fixation.
Ohh… Hey, go on. Get your coat.
So, uh… how's the case going?
Look, forget about the case.
Enjoy your sick leave.
Any ideas who blew the op?
No. Investigation's underway. So far, zip.
Somebody talked.
Somebody inside… close to us.
Any word on what happened to Rogue?
No. We never found a body.
They dragged that bay for three days, and nothing.
And he's fish food by now.
Okay. Well, it's game day, right?
Yeah, I know it's game day.
Just tell me you haven't forgot the steaks, okay?
No, asshole, I didn't forget the steaks.
Christ, when are you gonna let that go?
Diane asked me to check. Yo, she also asked me to--
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard. No smoking in front of the kids.
Honey, we gotta stop off and get some steaks.
Diane, they here yet?
Please!
Diane. What was that?
Diane?
[Diane] No!
Please!
No!
[screaming] No!
John. John.
Honey.
Honey. Honey.
What the--
Oh, my God.
Stay with Daniel, honey.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
-What the hell happened? -I'm gonna have--
We got three fatalities.
What?
One male, one female, and one child.
Hey, wait a minute, pal. FBI or not…
[Man] Sir.
CSI needs to finish.
We gotta let 'em do their thing.
Sir?
You gotta clear out of here now.
♪ Oh, uh-oh, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Oh-oh, uh-oh, oh, hey, hey, hey ♪
♪ Uh-oh… ♪
-Yes! -Yeah! Come on!
Hey, baby. How you doing?
[in Japanese] Get him!
Kimo!
Kimo!
[in Japanese] Daito, heel.
[in Japanese] What the fuck?
[man in Japanese] Rogue, do you know what Shiro does to traitors?
[in English] Wow. These Japs sure know how to party, huh?
Yeah. Smells like a deli in here.
Oh, shut up, Gleason.
See all this ink?
Japanese Yakuza.
Each one of those rings is supposed to represent
some poor bastard they've killed.
These are some bad-ass characters here.
Yeah? What's that make the people who did this, then?
Make a hole.
Get these people out of here.
And just who the hell are you?
Asian Organized Crime Unit. We'll be taking over from here.
On whose authority!
Mayor, President. Take your pick.
You don't look very Asian to me.
You know, I'm amazed you two
don't have this whole case wrapped up by now.
Check these yet, Einstein?
Yeah. Someone cut the feeds. There's nothing on there.
Agent Crawford.
I found these in the back room.
We found him hiding underneath one of the dead bodies.
He's in pretty bad shape.
Yeah? What's he been saying?
You're kidding me, right?
Who can understand that shit?
These people come into this country,
you'd think they'd at least learn to speak American.
You'd think a couple of cops working a district
that's crawling with Yakuza might learn to speak a little Japanese.
[in Japanese] If they weren't complete fucking idiots.
[in English] Give me a minute here, would you?
[in Japanese] Hi… I'm a cop.
What happened here?
Know what I do when I'm not a cop?
Play doctor.
[in English] Hey! You can't do that!
[in Japanese] If I don't get this shrapnel out…
it will get infected.
I got it. No, it's a bone. Sorry.
No, it's a bone. Sorry.
You want me to go back to my day job?
Give me something to do!
[in Japanese] I want to die… before he comes back.
[in English] Well.
I can see it's gonna be a real picnic working with you.
You aren't working with me.
This is the FBI's case now.
You wanna help, you can take my shirts to the cleaners.
So, what'd he say?
A bunch of Japanese mumbo-jumbo.
Vengeful spirits.
Ghost stories.
Jen?
Yeah. Did I wake you?
It's almost 9:00.
Oh, no. I was working late last night, that's all.
Oh. Well, I just called to remind you
that it's Daniel's first basketball game this Friday.
You forgot, didn't you?
No.
I've just been tied up with work.
-I got a lot on my mind right now. -See ya.
Yeah? So what's it this time?
I've found him, Jen.
Found who?
The guy who killed Tom.
He's back. -I can feel it. -[sighs]
This time, I'm taking him down.
John, it's been three years.
Look, your obsession with this man has cost you our marriage.
Don't lose your son.
Tell Daniel I'll be there.
No, you tell him.
And if you say you're gonna be there, then be there.
Fuck.
For those of you who didn't get to meet last night,
this is Agent Goi.
Just graduated Quantico.
What's his specs?
Marksman.
[Goi] What's so funny?
In other words, you're a spectator.
What about you? D.T.
Defensive Tactics. That's right.
I like to get up close and personal.
Yeah, well, my gun's bigger than yours.
[Crawford] Pick a desk.
We're still getting set up here ourselves.
Back of the bus.
These are all the photos anybody has of Rogue.
Bastard re-cuts his face every six months.
Come on, John, anybody can use titanium shells and D.U. bullets.
The ones we found-- The ones we found last night
match the ones we found three years ago.
Rogue's back.
Okay, but if he works for the Yakuza,
why would he kill Yakuza?
Maybe he's switched sides. Wouldn't be the first time.
What sides are we talking about here?
Shiro Yanagawa.
Runs all Yakuza activity from Japan.
Probably the most powerful man in San Francisco,
and yet he's never even set foot on American soil.
He's half the reason this task force was put together.
Li Chang is the other half.
Unlike Shiro, Chang lives here.
Nice big mansion in Marin.
Thinks he's J.D. Rockefeller or something.
He's a 4-89.
A Triad boss.
Into everything: bribery, extortion, murder, you name it.
Thirty years ago, Shiro butchered Chang's family.
Actually had the balls to fly over to Hong Kong
and wipe out the whole fucking clan.
He spent the next 30 years selling every heirloom in the Chang dynasty
to collectors and museums.
All that's left now is a couple of horses.
Statuettes. Two of 'em. About this big.
Word on the street is that Shiro's looking for a buyer as we speak.
Chang's loss of honor means more than his financial loss.
[Crawford] I don't care about the horses.
I don't care about bloodlines or ancient family feuds.
For the first time in three years, we got a real shot at getting Rogue.
All we have to do, ladies and gentlemen,
is pull the fucking trigger.
She's a very rare breed.
Andalusian.
That's my wife Maria.
In my father's day, such a union would not have been possible.
But times change.
Those of us who change with it… survive.
Come.
I am really impressed, Mr. Shaw.
Now that you have spilled the blood of my enemies…
let's drink to our new partnership.
I have to admit…
I was somewhat skeptical
when you first came to me with your proposal.
But leaving Shiro's service,
that was a wise move on your part.
But it makes me wonder.
How could one truly trust a man who has betrayed his master?
I have no master,
so I have betrayed no one.
So, tell me.
My horses, they arrive tonight?
It's been 30 years.
All this time, my family has lived in shame and dishonor,
all because of Shiro's treachery.
Tonight I will take back what was stolen from my family,
and everything will change from here on.
Shiro's men will protect his treasure with their lives.
Are you certain you can deliver them?
I said I would.
These two are the Ti brothers.
They will give you everything you need.
I'll be in touch.
Watch him closely.
[in Japanese] I beg your forgiveness.
[in Japanese] The fault is not yours, but mine.
I left myself unguarded.
[continues in Japanese] I trust you have news from San Francisco.
[in Japanese] Yes, everything is proceeding as requested.
And the Horses?
We've shipped them out.
They will arrive in San Francisco tonight.
You must return to San Francisco in advance of my arrival.
But father…
I don't trust our people there.
They have become too lazy to be useful.
I was hoping to stay here and further my role in the clan.
Nothing in the history of our clan… has ever been more important.
I will not fail you.
Go now. Oversee the sale of the Horses.
[in English] Hey, what's up, dude?
I need to see Benny.
No Bennys here.
Again!
Yeah, hit him!
Hey, what are you doing?
No!
Yeah! Again!
[man] Come on. Oh, ho!
Hey, baby, someone's here to see you.
We need to talk.
Cabrón, I don't talk to the Feds.
Come on!
Somewhere private.
Now.
Tranquilo.
My guy's losing anyway, so…
Come on, come on, come on!
Frankie, I'm paying for this shit! Come on!
Business is good, I see.
Yeah. So much for Homeland Security, right?
So how's the family?
Daniel's fine. But Jen…
that's another story.
You know, I really like her.
I mean, how could you fuck that up?
It wasn't hard.
By the way, thanks for that out there.
Made me look good.
Yeah, I hope it helps.
Yeah, well, the people I'm tracking,
they expect the FBI to pay me some visits like this.
Makes me look legit.
Was that in the Interpol handbook?
Come on, John, there's no science
to catching crooks. You know that.
Well, you said you had something for me.
Yeah.
Our friend over in Brussels?
The guy that make those titanium bullets?
Found him two days ago.
Then I ran a check. It seems everyone ever associated with Rogue
is having some bad luck.
Just last week plastic surgeon down in Panama
accidentally impaled himself with a kitchen knife
making a turkey sandwich.
Week before that, another one of our scalpel friends
down in Florida went skinny-dipping… with some gators. Guess he didn't read the signs.
with some gators. Guess he didn't read the signs.
Anyway. These guys,
Anyway. These guys, they both specialized in facial reconstruction.
Both of 'em.
So the man's tying up loose ends.
Yeah, well, there's another surgeon unaccounted for.
Think he might be still alive, maybe hiding out.
You let me know the second he surfaces.
Thanks, Benny.
[in Chinese] Button up, this isn't a disco.
Is that our contact?
Yes… my contact.
[in English] Get rid of him.
[in English] He's my brother. He's with me.
Who the fuck does this guy think he is?
Go back to your car.
Wu. Please. He's an outsider.
Go. Don't make me say it again.
[in Chinese] After this is done, you and I are going to talk.
[man in Japanese] The Horses are intact. Shira will be pleased.
We'll contact you when we get there.
Are the Horses safe with this crew?
Of course, as far as they know, they're delivering cars.
[in Japanese] Stay calm and cooperate. It's just a routine check.
[in English] I need you out of the car, both of you.
Put your hands where I can see them.
[in English] Officer, we're with Shiro Yanagawa Enterprises.
You're making a huge mistake. We made arrangements.
Out of the car!
Come on. Turn around.
We work security.
We are licensed to carry firearms.
-Call your captain. -Shut up.
-He'll vouch for us. -Shut up.
-[in Japanese] Fucking rent-a-cops-- -[in English] I said shut up!
Evening. Captain Andrews?
What the fuck is going on?
What about our arrangement?
Just a little change in plan.
I need my money… now.
So, we are good to go?
Oh, yeah. You're good to go.
Just wait here for a sec.
Let me and the boys clear out.
Let's go.
Do it.
Oy. Mr. Chang sends his regards.
No!
Compliments of Mr. Chang.
Some serious shit here, brother.
Yakuzas. All of 'em.
All lined up, shot through the back.
Execution style. Excuse me.
Forensics wants to know if you're ready for 'em to come in yet.
It was a heist.
What?
Check the space between these sedans.
These guys were escorting something big.
Whatever it was, it must've been important.
These guys were the guard dogs…
but they left their guns in the cars.
There's only one thing that would have stopped these guys from throwing down.
Cops.
At least they thought they were cops.
Hold on just a damn minute.
Are you trying to say that cops did this?
If they didn't, they were involved.
No fucking way!
For all we know, it could've been one of you guys.
I'm assuming…
that you know who the fuck I am.
You're a bitch for Shiro Yanagawa, aren't you, Captain?
You're the one who gives his boys free passes to smuggle in shit.
And you're the one who sold them out last night.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've never met Yana--
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
This is a Federal matter.
Look at it.
Look down the barrel.
Tell me if you see the bullet.
-Can you see it? -I see it!
He said he'll kill me.
He said he'll kill my family.
Who? Who said that?
I don't know who!
I don't know who!
He's with the Triads.
He works for the Changs! He knows where I live.
He knows where my kids go to school!
You stupid bastard.
What do you think Shiro Yanagawa's gonna do
when he finds out you fucked him?
Get a statement. Call the marshals.
Put his family under protective custody.
Down! Down! Down! Everyone, down!
-There's a shooter on the roof! -It's him.
Go!
Will, it's Agent Wick. I need Chase Squad backup
and an ambulance to Sloan's Steakhouse now.
Hang on, motherfucker.
Nothing.
This motherfucker's out.
[in Japanese] The Triads made us look like fools.
Kill. Kill them
Give me the word,
and I'll make them disappear.
Do it. Find them.
I want their heads, every one of them.
Hai.
Nobody told me you two were in charge now.
Kira-san. Welcome home.
Kira-san. Welcome home. Your presence honors us.
And your stupidity insults my father.
We were just discussing--
I've brought word from Shira directly.
You are to do nothing until he instructs you to.
The Horses have been stolen!
If we do not strike back--
Are you disobeying my father?
Good.
I'd like a salad.
I just got off a fourteen hour flight.
I'd like a salad.
Will somebody get me a salad!?
What… What kind?
Chef.
-No blue cheese. -No blue cheese.
Takada…
Hai.
With dressing on the side, please.
Hai.
[whispers in English] Bitch.
Yeah.
Special Agent [distorted] Crawford.
Who is this?
A messenger.
Messenger, huh?
The police captain in the restaurant,
was he part of your message?
[distorted] He was a crooked cop.
I just did what you wanted to do.
What the hell do you know about what I want, you fuck?
I saw it in your eyes, John.
Yeah? What did you see?
Pain.
Rage.
Loneliness.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we meet in my shrink's office and discuss it?
You want the stolen shipment?
Warehouse 16.
One hour.
Remain where you are and keep your hands above your heads.
What? Not happy to see us?
This is private property.
[Wick] R.S.V.P.
We came to party, baby.
Li Chang.
You still pretending to be legit?
Watch your mouth.
You forget who you're talking to here.
Open it.
I said… open it.
Open it!
Put your hands on the back of your head!
-[Crawford] Now, you motherfucker! -[laughs]
Get your fucking hands up.
No weapons. He's clean.
"Victor Shaw."
So that's what you call yourself now, huh?
Hong Kong passport and a security license out of Tokyo.
Run it.
Check the warehouse. Make sure nothing's hidden.
It's you, isn't it?
I remember your eyes.
There's something real familiar about 'em.
It's the one thing the surgeons can't change, can they?
The eyes.
They did a hell of a job on the rest of you, though.
Wouldn't even know you're the same man.
But you are, aren't you?
I know you are.
So, what's a Yakuza hit man doing working for the Triads?
I know you understand me.
It was you on the phone, wasn't it?
What? Don't remember?
Maybe you remember my partner.
You do, don't you?
Remember his name?
Tom Lone.
Remember his wife, Diane?
His four-year-old daughter Amy?
Remember a cabin in the woods?
A cabin that you burned to the ground,
their bodies still inside?
Remember that?
Do you remember that?
Say it.
Say it.
Say you remember.
Say you fucking remember blowing my partner's goddamn head off!
You will find only pain living in the past.
Crawford, there's nothing here. He checks out.
It's him, Terry.
I fucking know it.
So what if it is? Hmm?
Look, right now we got nothing.
Come on, man. It'll be another day.
All right?
Right now, we wait.
We play it smart.
And we do it right.
Another day.
And on that day, you and I are gonna finish this.
Count on that.
Everyone, move out.
How in the world did you know the FBI were coming?
Experience.
You have impressed me once again, my friend.
As you see,
the FBI has declared war on us.
Well, fuck them.
I trust you have secured my horses?
They're safe.
I still have a lot of work for you to do, my friend.
I think you'd better stay in my house for a while…
keep an eye on things.
Understood.
Oh, Victor.
This FBI guy, Crawford.
He is trouble.
He's chasing ghosts.
No!
Gimme a new one.
I said put up a new one now!
Did I scare you?
Where's your mother?
Do you want to play? We can play tag.
Go find your mother. I have things to do.
What's that?
Wow. Do it again.
Ana.
He's showing me a magic trick.
Why don't you go downstairs and play for Mommy?
But we were playing.
I know, but I'll be downstairs in just a minute, okay?
Bye.
I understand you have business here,
but I am warning you to stay away from Ana.
My husband's work and our family are two separate things.
Do we understand each other?
Yes, Mrs. Chang.
Good.
Don't think I don't know what you are doing.
Mr. Chang might think you're his man right now.
But I am still the one
who looks after things around here.
At every moment in the world, things change.
"Don't make me say it again," he fucking tells me.
Relax.
What the fuck?
Motherfucker!
Fucking Yakuza! Let's go!
[man in Chinese] …teach that fucking Jap a lesson!
[in Japanese] Triads are coming!
[in Japanese] Triad motherfuckers… get 'em!
[in English] Buddha-heads!
Fucking Yakuza!
You fucking bastard!
I knew I should never have trusted you.
Subtle, ain't it?
It's got Shiro's trademark.
So what now?
Get ready for a war.
Joey Ti, got your ass.
Park, I want you outside Chang's place in Marin.
Daniels, you get Yanagawa Motors.
Kinler, you get Warehouse 16.
Wick, take Goi. Keep an eye on the Sayu Tea House.
I get the new guy, huh?
I think I know how to look through a night scope.
Eyes open, everybody. This shit's going to go down somewhere.
Be ready to move when you get the call.
Binoculars. No night scope.
The authorities are expecting us to retaliate.
We strike now, we risk everything.
What if it was your family?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You forgot?
Once it was my family!
Joey was like a son to me.
Revenge is a must.
But you've got to learn to be patient.
I will allow nothing to put our family at risk.
I want you to do nothing.
Is that clear?
Shiro knows his days are coming to an end.
One thing's for sure:
more blood will be spilled before this is over.
Mr. Shaw,
I want your word that my wife and daughter will be safe.
No harm will come to them.
A man should never give up his honor.
Or the honor of his family.
Keep them.
I don't smoke.
Oh, man.
I didn't know your mom was working tonight.
Keep your eye on the mark, Goi.
Yo, heads up.
Looks like Takada's having a little tea party, huh?
[in English] Now, that's some spicy tuna, huh?
Shit. Get Crawford and call for backup.
It's going down now.
Crawford.
We got trouble.
Wu just showed up, like you said.
-I'm on my way. -Copy that.
Move! Move!
Yo, going in. Cover me.
[in Japanese] This is for my brother.
-[man in English] He's dead! -[man 2] Come on!
-On three. -What?
-Three. -Oh, shit.
-Freeze! -Shit!
FBI! Drop your weapons.
Drop your weapons. Hands on the counter where I can see them!
Closer.
The fuck--
Situation secure. All units stand down and cease fire.
Damn it, Goi, he said cease fucking fire!
Shit.
[whispering] Look. Goi's right there.
We got a shooter, guys.
I got him!
Don't fucking move.
Get the other one.
Fuck you!
In Japan…
you'd be dead.
This isn't Japan.
I said no, no, no, no.
Yes?
Wu and his boys shot up Takada's tea house last night.
What?
Wu Ti?
Uh, are you sure?
I tried to stop them.
God damn it. I told him not to do anything.
He leaves me with no choice.
You've done well.
My father is very pleased.
He now asks one more thing of you.
After I kill Chang, his operation will be destroyed.
What more could Shiro want?
The heads of the wife and child.
Why?
That's the order. There is no why.
You never had a problem killing women and children before.
Would you dare disobey your master?
I have no master.
These are my guards.
They will assist you in this task as you best decide.
If I refuse?
You dropped this.
What is happening, John?
There are men with guns in my front yard.
Just a precaution.
A precaution? For what?
A precaution? For what? What have you gotten us into?
Oh, my God.
It's him, isn't it?
He's coming after us.
It's not gonna happen.
Oh, I'm sorry, Jen--
not just for this, for everything.
I tried to do the right thing…
make a good life for you and Daniel,
to give you the things you needed.
It never had anything to do with what we did or didn't have.
It was the job.
The job always came first.
Even now, even knowing you might be putting us in the same danger
Tom and his family were in.
You know, I'm not even mad at you anymore.
Most days I just feel sorry for you,
for what you've become.
It's Benny.
Say hi to Benny for me.
What you got, Benny?
We found your plastic surgeon.
Welcome home, Dr. Sherman.
Hey, jefe, what's cooking?
Step in here.
Let's have a talk. Come on.
Agent Crawford? Is that--
I don't know anything, really. I don't know anything.
Doc, come on. You kidding me?
Can you explain to me
why one of the world's most brilliant nip-and-tuckers
is hiding out in the slums of Mexico?
What are you, a fucking Nazi war criminal?
Look, I were you, I'd be lapping up that pussy
on South Beach, stretching it out.
Come on now.
Look, I could give a shit about whatever laws you've broken.
That's not why we're here.
I need you to identify this man.
We know what happened to the other two doctors.
We know you could be next.
We can protect you. You don't know him.
Protect me? You can't protect me.
You can't stop him.
You found me here, he can find me here.
I can stop him.
All I need from you is a yes or a no.
Is this Rogue?
Is this Rogue?
We, uh… we-- we used to get…
commissioned…
by the U.S. government,
and we all did a lot of surgeries on him when he was with the CIA.
We changed his face a lot of times.
He, uh, he came to me three years ago.
His face was almost torn off. I just did what I could.
I repaired the muscle, the nerve tissue.
I reconstructed the facial bones.
I never saw him again.
This is what I made him look like.
Look, Doc, we're going to take you with us.
We're going to protect you, understand?
Why don't you go get some things together and we'll go?
-Doc. -Uh-huh?
What? Yeah.
Is it okay if I-- if I--
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead.
You believe in fate, Benny?
Fate? Yeah.
You know, no matter what you do,
You know, no matter what you do, your future's already decided.
I don't know about that.
I always thought your future depends on what choices you make.
I have made all the necessary arrangements.
I will join you as soon as I finish here, okay?
Don't worry.
Okay. I'll be back to walk you out.
I love you.
My crew's gone.
My brother is dead.
You brought it onto yourself.
And how did I do that?
I gave you my trust.
I gave you my loyalty.
I sacrificed everything for you, and this is how I'm treated?
You've got a lot of nerve to talk to me about loyalty.
You're a fucking traitor!
Die!
That piece of shit.
He tells me that he's loyal,
that he's my friend.
I trusted him.
He's right.
He was loyal. He was your friend.
What?
Holy shit.
AOC base from Clark.
We've got some major action at the Chang mansion.
[in Chinese] What's going on? Is the boss okay?
No!
Chang is dead.
And the woman and child?
Take me to the bodies so I can take their heads.
No. I killed them.
I should have that honor.
Mommy?
Keep your eyes closed, okay?
Where's my husband?
-Where's Clark? -He's on his way back.
He send the photos?
Yes, sir.
What the fuck happened out there?
[Goi] Looks like Rogue took out Chang and turned on Shiro's assassins.
He's using them,
playing both sides against each other.
[Goi] Why would he do that?
John, you're never going to believe who just flew in.
[in Japanese] Father, I'm so happy to see you.
[in Japanese] And, I am happy to see you.
[in English] This country looks very beautiful.
[in English] Your English is improving.
Ha ha! I have been practicing.
This is my new home, after all.
[in Japanese] Rogue insisted on delivering the Horses himself.
[in Japanese] You've made me very proud.
I must ask one more thing of you.
Anything.
Return to Japan.
But I want to stay with you.
If I am to oversee the expansion here,
I need someone who can ensure our interests in Japan.
The only person I can trust is you, Kira.
[in English] Shiro Yanagawa.
FBI Special Agent John Crawford.
[in Japanese] Step back.
[in English] Welcome to America.
Don't unpack. You won't be staying long.
[in English] Agent Crawford, I'm a busy man.
We got a lot of business, you and me.
I think you know that.
Three years ago, Rogue killed my partner and his family.
And you know what?
Rogue was working for you.
Ha ha ha. Rogue is a myth, just a rumor.
You think so, huh?
[John] Can't always trust rumors, can you?
Rogue turns around and fucking slices up
the heavy hitters you sent with him.
Now, you got to ask yourself--
Now, why would he do something like that?
I've never seen this man before in my life.
Look, I don't care if you fucking slaughter each other
till you're all dead and buried.
Truth is, it makes my job a lot easier.
If I find proof that ties any of this shit back to you,
you ain't never going to see Japan again.
And neither will that pretty little daughter of yours.
Thanks for the tip, Agent Crawford.
[in English] Finally,
my most loyal stranger,
we meet face-to-face.
Yanagawa-san, I've waited a long time for this moment.
It's all because of you
that we now have this opportunity.
Kira enjoyed working with you here.
One day she will make a fine leader of the Yanagawa clan.
Yeah. One day.
I am reminded of the Sengoku…
when the daimyo warriors fought each other to unite Japan,
the one who finally succeeded was a man by the name of Oda Nobunaga.
And do you know how he did it?
He killed everyone who opposed him.
Thanks to you,
all those who oppose me here are dead.
I exist but to serve you.
In Asia, these could never be sold.
But the fortune they will bring here in the West
will be more than enough to continue our American expansion.
And now it is time for your reward.
Open it.
One must remove all future threats.
You allowed a threat to remain
by not killing the woman and child.
You have disobeyed me
and broken my most sacred code.
Your code, not mine.
Betrayal cannot be forgiven.
[in Japanese] Take him downstairs.
Persuade him to tell us where the wife and child are.
[in Japanese] They are truly magnificent.
So many deaths for such small trinkets…
Fakes!
[in Japanese] Find me the woman and child. They'll lead us to the real horses.
[in English] After all these years,
why do you do this?
You ordered the hit.
I ordered many hits.
This one was different.
You should have left the wife and daughter alone.
No!
I left none to seek revenge.
You left one.
Your assassin, Rogue, never made it out alive.
So…
you're Tom Lone.
Changing your face, your voice…
all so you could get to me.
Pain can be a weapon, if you so choose.
How do you think we found out you were FBI in the first place?
It was Crawford.
You killed my family.
It was Crawford.
He's the one who gave you up.
Crawford worked for me.
Because of him, your family's dead!
Somebody talked.
Someone inside, close to us.
You never know who's working for who.
Somebody talked.
[Goi] Crawford?
Shiro's dead.
Get out of this business while you can, Goi.
[in Japanese] From America? Leave me.
MAKE A NEW LIFE
Crawford.
Remember the night we met?
I remember my partner blowing your face off.
You live today only because of what he did.
I live today only to kill you, you miserable prick.
Meet me there.
Goi.
Where are you?
Show yourself!
I got your surgeon.
He made a positive I.D.
Come on, Crawford, flush him out.
It's over, Rogue.
You hear me?
Why did you do it?
What did Shiro promise you that was worth my life
or the lives of Diane and Amy?
-No. -[gasping]
You're not him.
It can't be.
You don't even sound like him.
Look at my eyes, John.
The one thing the surgeons can never change.
Jesus, Tom.
Is it really you?
Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was the only way I could get the man responsible.
But all along,
I never thought it would bring me back to my best friend.
I didn't know they'd send Rogue.
For Christ's sakes, I thought he was dead.
They said they wanted to teach you a lesson
for shooting Rogue:
just rough you up a bit, that's all.
Is that what they told you?
Shiro ordered everything.
I tried to stop working for him…
to get out so many times.
I thought if I could make that son of a bitch pay for what he did to you,
somehow it would make things right again.
You think you can forgive me, Tom?
Tom Lone is dead.
My name is Rogue.
You don't know where you are. Yes, I do! I'm in hell!
Yes, I do! I'm in hell!

What's that you're reading? Oh, just a book of poetry. (BOTH CHUCKLING)
"The hounds of the crimson sky gave tongue, "but never a cry gave he."
"but never a cry gave he." That's Ezra Pound, the poet.

I'll be back the first Tuesday in August.
In August? (PHONE RINGING)
Ethan, Sam. This is Rachel, my...
...granddaughter. Do we have to like her?
Do we have to like her? How old is she?
No. And forget about it.
I was just asking a question.
You could offer us some. The kids are thirsty, too.
Wanna sip?
I gotta finish here.
GEORGIA: How was work? I should have his license pulled. He saw a pit bull and a peeing woman all in the same day.
He saw a pit bull and a peeing woman all in the same day.
Are you anywhere near shame, making these little boys work like this? Let me do it. No, I can do it.

GEORGIA: Okay. Shut up! That's it!
Punch her, Sam! Pull her hair! (RACHEL SCREAMS)
Gather your senses! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, you're hard.
You had ample warning about the Lord's name. Dude, it was a fight! You don't pull a boner in a battle.
Dude, it was a fight! You don't pull a boner in a battle.
Go back and hit her, Sam.
In your mouth. RACHEL: What? In your mouth.
Are you frigging serious? The kid can get stiff on my leg
and I can't use the Lord's name? Rachel, you cannot use the Lord's name in vain.
Rachel, you cannot use the Lord's name in vain. She's trying to get me to eat soap. I am not eating that shit.
No. Give it to someone else. Guys, want some soap? She's giving out free soap.

Happy?
Paula Richards, Rachel Wilcox, my granddaughter.
Georgia's been so excited about your visit.
What now, Grandma?
You can take it out. Grab a chair. Thanks.
Hey.
I'm... I'm done. May I be excused? Yeah.
Hey, would you go out and get us some ice cream? There's money in the jar.
Rachel is working for Simon. So I heard. That's great.
So, is he queer, or what?
Simon is Paula's brother.
He lost his wife and son in a car accident three years ago, and it takes time.
For a smart girl, you're good at stupid.
Dog comes up out of nowhere. Okay. Yeah. Rachel?
I would've shot him hadn't he took a piece of me like he done. Please. Don't... Don't shoot a dog. I'd have to deal with that.
Please. Don't... Don't shoot a dog. I'd have to deal with that.
You're gonna be all right in a couple days. I suggest you bring a cushion to the barbecue, though. The peeing lady's back.
Every week.
My... Georgia wants me to help her out for the Fourth of July barbecue tomorrow. So, I'm gonna take off.
So, I'm gonna take off.
Yeah, but first there's some gauze in my office. Will you bring that to me?
Yeah. Sorry.
SIMON: That should do, Harold. All right?
Is it in there?
Harold. Yeah. Can you get that tape started? HAROLD: Let me see that.
SIMON: I'm having trouble with that. HAROLD: I can't find the end of it.
HAROLD: I can't find the end of it. SIMON: Me neither. Both of us need glasses.
SIMON: Me neither. Both of us need glasses. Find it?
Yeah.
HAROLD: I used to have 20/20, you know? See anything in the dark.
Is that gonna scar?

Oh, she just likes me 'cause I just neutered her dog. That's nice.
That's nice.
What about the music teacher? No. She's my landlord. I can't date my landlord.
No. She's my landlord. I can't date my landlord.
Georgia sent over a plate and some pie for you.
You didn't alter it? Poison it?
RACHEL: That's Bach! She's playing Bach! I was expecting some ass-kicking country music.
I was expecting some ass-kicking country music. Oh, well, we have our cultural side.
Oh, well, we have our cultural side. Couldn't tell from Harlan.
Couldn't tell from Harlan.
Few months, he's going on a mission for the Mormon Church.
I'm not stopping him. No, but you could.
Are you one?
My sister and nephews are. I'm taking a little break.
And Georgia? Not a Mormon.
But she pushes a lot of their family values. People do what they want to do.
People do what they want to do.
Sometimes what they don't.
I'm not sure Harlan could survive you.
(SCOFFS) Come on. Don't preach to me about what I can and can't do.
(SCOFFS) Come on. Don't preach to me about what I can and can't do. Or I will poison you.
Or I will poison you.
Anybody can do anything to anyone.
You can't stop what's done to you. You can only survive it. Oh, please. You're 17.
Oh, please. You're 17.
So you're a prisoner of Idaho, I feel for you. You don't... You don't have a clue about surviving.
You don't... You don't have a clue about surviving.
Oh, and you invented it, didn't you?
We can all tell. The survivor.
You wear it so well in your walk, in your face, in your eyes.
You've got a dead wife and a dead baby, and we're all so proud you're still even here.
and we're all so proud you're still even here.
Do you know I was 12 years old when my stepfather first started having sex with me?
when my stepfather first started having sex with me?
I loved him. He was nice to me.
We can all survive, Simon.
You just don't have to be so damn sad doing it.
Hey, Rachel, take a shot!
Three, two, one! Good shot, Rachel!
WOMAN: Oh, sorry, we're out of peach. How about some rhubarb?
My girl's name is June.
Her name's June.
Is she pretty?
Well, I've known her all my life, you know. Never really thought of her in terms of what you might think of her.
Never really thought of her in terms of what you might think of her. It's just, we said we'd get married back in sixth grade,
It's just, we said we'd get married back in sixth grade, and we will.
Simon says you might be going on a mission for the Mormons.
Yeah. I'm looking forward to it.
I'm not looking forward to cutting all my hair off, though. It's got to be above the ears for the mission.
It's got to be above the ears for the mission.
Your hair will grow back.
How long do you have to go for? Two years.
Long time. Can you have sex on a mission?
(LAUGHING) No. No.
Not... Not until you're married.
Wait. So are you saying you've never even had sex before?
You're a virgin, aren't you? Have you?
Have you?
That's funny.
Are you allowed to look?
Pardon me?
Look, I think... I think we'd better get back on. Get... Get on back.
Yeah. In a magazine, I suppose.
It's getting pretty late.
Would you like to see? Nope. I'd better not. What, is there a law against looking?
What, is there a law against looking? (CHUCKLES)
You can touch if you like.
My turn.
I think we should stop. Well, hey, that's no fair.
I don't apologize for anything.
Okay.
Hello? Well... Are you gonna invite me in?
No.
Well, should I be at work tomorrow?
Why not? I don't know. I...
I mean, I guess what I said about your wife and kid?
You were right. They're dead, and it shows on me. (EXCLAIMS)
I just wanted to tell you that all that junk that I said about my stepfather, I made it all up. Sympathy vote.
I made it all up. Sympathy vote.
You did?
Yeah, I needed to make a point. I lie if it helps make the point.
I lie if it helps make the point. Rachel, I talked to your grandmother about what you told me.
Rachel, I talked to your grandmother about what you told me. Why? I didn't have any choice.
Why? I didn't have any choice. I'll take something like that seriously.
You stupid ass! Don't hit me with fish.
I mean, can't you tell what the truth is? Everybody knows I lie. Nobody believes me.
Everybody knows I lie. Nobody believes me. I believe you.
Well, you don't count!
Well, you don't count! God, I cannot believe that you would do that! You are such an idiot!
God, I cannot believe that you would do that! You are such an idiot!
GEORGIA: Oh, Rachel.
I went fishing with Harlan. I'm gonna put these in the freezer. Rachel.
I'm gonna ask you once.
And I'll know whether you're telling me the truth or not because you are a part of me. I don't understand you at all,
because you are a part of me. I don't understand you at all, but I understand me. I'll know.
I'm really tired.
Did... Did Arnold molest you?
If he did, he'd be dead.
You'll be late. (PHONE RINGING)
Late is only relative
to what causes you to become it. (LILLY EXCLAIMS)

I'm driving to talk to June at her school in Rexburg and I'd like you to come with me. Why?
Why?
Because the only way out of this I see is I'm gonna marry you. What? What?
What? What? I gotta tell June in person.

If you could just... I have to repent! Repent for what? That's retarded!

No. No, we're not getting married. I don't think so. Oh! Is that her?

When Dad was dying, nearly dead, did you ever miss a meal? Eat late? Eat early?
Eat late? Eat early?
No. Same time. Alone.
I could turn the radio on. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)
You're a minute late. Enjoy your meal. I'm gonna go wait for Rachel.
Life is much less of a surprise when it's all timed down.
This isn't a surprise, Mother. This is a damn lie.
Hey. Come on. We're here.
So the deal is I can't see you, talk to you, or be anywhere near you.
I wasn't exactly in the bargaining position.
It's not fair.
She's gonna have everyone she knows watching me from now on.
You're my only friend.
Okay, fine.
Rachel?
Okay. Well...
Bye.
Enjoy yourself?
Have fun?
Mom, what are you doing here? Where's Grandma?
Went to bed. I waited up for you.
I have been sitting here for hours, thinking how is it that I'm ever gonna be able to forgive you?
Sometimes I think the same thing about you.
And then, it occurred to me a while ago, that the only weapon I have left,
I've used every other,
is my love for you.
You could have phoned it in, Mom.
I love you. Did you practice that in the mirror?
Wait! He thinks of you as his own daughter.
He thinks of you as his own daughter. That's what I don't understand, Rachel.

Yeah, okay, that is my fault. I just... I didn't want to be like my mother,

When I was 12.
When did it stop?
When a friend of mine threatened to kill him. That's when I was 14.
He bought me the Mustang on the condition that I start again.
So I crashed it.
GEORGIA: Rachel? Ha...
Ham and cheese.
One's for Simon. Here you go.
Yeah, have a nice day.
If you're not in for breakfast in 15 minutes, you'll have to wait for lunch.

SIMON: I'll be right with you, Mr. Lynwood.
How long have you been doing that for?
Oh, since college. Just... Just relaxes me. I just play for myself, really.
Have you dated since your wife passed away? It hasn't entered my mind.
It hasn't entered my mind.
But, you know, I used to date your mother. I know.
In fact, I was crazy about her.
Why didn't you marry her, save us all the trouble?
Well, things don't always work out the way you think they should.
But you know about that.
Wait, that's weird. So, you could have been my dad.
But your dad had a car, I had a cow. (CHUCKLES) It's always about a car.

He was exactly what you wouldn't want a daughter to marry.
Lilly was angry, with everybody, even me, when she left with him.
How could you even stand her? She reminds me of you.
She reminds me of you. (SCOFFS) I know.
SIMON: There.
Do you wanna hear something weird? Probably not.
When Arnold held me, I hated the sex.
But then, sometimes before, when he just held me,
I felt loved.
And I... I mean, how can that be true?
Maybe the holding part was love, Rachel. I'm not sure.
But I know everything else was a lie.
I'm gonna show you the top to this stupid thing so we can finish it and you can go home. I won't look. Here, here.
I won't look. Come on.
I'm not looking! Well, how are you supposed to do a puzzle if you don't know what it's supposed to look like?
if you don't know what it's supposed to look like? It's like telling you how your life will end.
It's like telling you how your life will end. Just makes everything in between killing time.
Just makes everything in between killing time. Go on, go home.
Go on, go home. I don't wanna go home. You can't stay here. Good night.
You can't stay here. Good night.
GEORGIA: Time for bed!
I found these in the closet.
I thought they'd be safer there. (LAUGHS)
Most people dig out presents they don't like when the person that gave them comes to visit.
when the person that gave them comes to visit.
I don't keep flowers in the house.
It's 10:02, Mother. Go to bed.
Oh, come on.
There was a time you would have dragged me by my hair out of here for drinking. I'm too old. So's your hair.
I'm too old. So's your hair.
That's good.
These go here. There. There.
Come here, come on. Let me take you to bed. No. Come on.
No, you don't get second chances! Don't come into my life and try and save me, 'cause I'm not savable!
Don't come into my life and try and save me, 'cause I'm not savable! Everybody's savable! That's the rule.
Everybody's savable! That's the rule. LILLY: Screw your rules!
I begged you, "Please, Mommy!" for help at Daddy's funeral.
I begged you, "Please, Mommy!" for help at Daddy's funeral. And... And that's when I needed saving, Mother,
And... And that's when I needed saving, Mother, but, no, you wouldn't give me a cent. GEORGIA: You were drinking.
I was alone with a four-year-old to raise.
I was scared. Arnold saved us. Arnold saved me.
I wanted you to stay.
I wanted you to die!
Not really. Just a little.
Why do you need to hurt her?
Because you slept with my husband.
Rachel. (SHOUTS)
Mom?
Grandma! I need help. GEORGIA: I'll handle it. I didn't touch her.
GEORGIA: I'll handle it. I didn't touch her. LILLY: Don't touch me. Mom!
Go to your room.
Why did you let her start again? I can handle it. Leave me with her. Go! Go!
I can handle it. Leave me with her. Go! Go!
Let me look. Let me look.
Careful of the glass. Can you get up? Mmm-hmm. Okay, I'm getting up.
Where are we going? We're going to bed. I'm gonna put you in bed and I'm gonna give you an aspirin.
I'm gonna put you in bed and I'm gonna give you an aspirin. LILLY: I'm good. I'm gonna make this.
LILLY: I'm good. I'm gonna make this.
LILLY: I'm good. I'm gonna make this. Okay. I'm gonna...
(LILLY COUGHS)
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm gonna throw up. Not on the rug.
Let me help, I've done this before.
Let me help, I've done this before. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Come on, Mom.
Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Come on, Mom.
Okay, okay. This is good. This is good! (LILLY LAUGHING)
Can you make it upstairs without throwing up, please?
I am fishing! It's just me and my dog.
Rachel's not here, and I'm not happy about it.
WOMAN: The doctor won't hurt you, it's okay.
Oh, I don't know, Melodee, he seems like a pretty calm little pig. Yeah, right now. But then suddenly he gets all jumpy,
Yeah, right now. But then suddenly he gets all jumpy,
Yeah, right now. But then suddenly he gets all jumpy, starts running around and squealing, and he disrupts the other pigs.
and he disrupts the other pigs. You think it's stress?
Pig stress?
Slut!
Slut!
I gotta get to work. I got that lasso in for you.
He doesn't think I'm pretty. He doesn't like me. No, no, no. He likes Trouble, on the bench over there.
No, no, no. He likes Trouble, on the bench over there.
Where's Rachel? GEORGIA: At Simon's.
Goody.
I told her to go there until you're... Till you're feeling better. Where are you going now?
I'm going for a drive. You're not dressed for a drive.
You're not dressed for a drive. I'm thirsty, okay? I'm dying of thirst.
I'm thirsty, okay? I'm dying of thirst.
And I'm waking up, and I can't stand the feeling. I'm gonna go buy booze, busybody.
I'm gonna go buy booze, busybody. No!
Wasn't a question. No!
No more drinking in the house! Oh, Jesus. (SCREAMING) Georgia rule. Mother, let me go!
Georgia rule. Mother, let me go! I don't care about your rules!
Fuck off! Hey, no! Oh, will you grow...
Get off me! Get off me! You...
All right! All right! All right, all right, all right!
I called Arnold last night and I asked him for a divorce.
You okay, Mother?
You lost your...
My mind?
I'll get the booze. Go inside.
Thank you.
Have a nice party, Georgia.

Oh, you cut your hair.
It was getting in the way of my drinking.
All I remember are Dad's hugs. His laugh.
All I remember are Dad's hugs. His laugh. After all of it, just good things.
After all of it, just good things. Well, good.
Well, good.
Why... Why did you try so hard to take that away from me?
Did I? Little things.
Little things. We loved to watch TV together, so you took it away.
We loved to watch TV together, so you took it away. Television was a distraction. Your grades were slipping.
Television was a distraction. Your grades were slipping. Were you afraid how much Daddy and I were alike?
Were you afraid how much Daddy and I were alike? How much he relied on me?

You know, mostly,
I was afraid you'd run off and marry an idiot, lose everything you had a chance at, just like me.
lose everything you had a chance at, just like me.
I blamed you for his drinking.
Oh. For yours, too?
Yeah.

I haven't got a clue.
If you ever really loved me. (SCOFFS) Don't be ridiculous.

No, I mean, just ever. It wouldn't have to include right now. What do you think the rules were?
What do you think the rules were? Why would I... Why would I waste my time
Why would I... Why would I waste my time on somebody that I didn't care about?
Yeah. I can't ever remember you saying it.
Well, my parents never said it. So how do you know if they did?
So how do you know if they did?
I don't.
I hate that you bought me so many.
You gonna drink the rest of them?
How could I not love you?
Rachel? Oh, it's just Dr. Ward today.

Where's Rachel? Oh, it's Saturday. I gave her the day off. She went fishing with Harlan.
She went fishing with Harlan.
I need to stop drinking.
I'm in no hurry.
How can I help?
She's pregnant, is all.
SIMON: Why don't you wait in the office? This'll just take a second. LILLY: Okay.
She's got that California tan. You think it's real or a spray-on?
You think it's real or a spray-on? I don't know.
RACHEL: It's risky being my friend. Yeah, well, that's kind of what I was coming around to is,
Yeah, well, that's kind of what I was coming around to is, you know, maybe we could be more than friends.
you know, maybe we could be more than friends. You know, if you thought you could ever sort of...
You know, if you thought you could ever sort of...
I don't know. Love me?
I'm kicking men, Harlan. No, really.
So I guess that's what I was trying to say. Kicking men. Yeah, well, I'll be gone for two years, on this mission.
Yeah, well, I'll be gone for two years, on this mission.
You can't kick forever, can you?
I promise I'll write.
I think they're going. Okay, get on the cell phone. Call the girls. Let's follow them.
Okay, get on the cell phone. Call the girls. Let's follow them.
More kittens. As if this town needs more cats.
And that was my last patient. (CLOCK CHIMING)
Remember the clock tower?
I do. Do you? Like it was yesterday.
Like it was yesterday. We changed the clock back.
(LAUGHING) Yeah. Yeah. And the whole day, the whole town was just a mess.
And the whole day, the whole town was just a mess.
Except you, you weren't a mess. Anyway, I... I need Antabuse.
Anyway, I... I need Antabuse.
Well, that makes you violently ill if you drink. I already am violently ill.
I already am violently ill.
I'm going to Rexburg later. I'll pick some up.
Thanks.
SIMON: Is that all you need?
How did I miss what I missed?
People get busy.
Too busy to notice what your husband is doing to your daughter?
Yeah, I don't know how you missed that.
You always tell me the truth. Thank you.
What was that? I... I'm sorry.
No.
Thank you. Thank you. I gotta go.
How long do we have to sit here for?
Smells like rain.
GRACE: Okay, okay. Let's do it. Mandy, get ready.
Harlan? Harlan!
(CLICKS) HARLAN: Oh, give us a break, Grace! (ALL LAUGHING)
GRACE: Let's go.
Car won't start. (ENGINE STARTS)
She's gonna ram us! Oh, my God! Get out! Go!
Oh, my God! Get out! Go!
Hi. I want to introduce myself. I'm Rachel Wilcox. Nice to meet you. Grace Cunningham.
Hi, girls. How you doing?
Look, I just drove over here to tell you that Harlan and I, we're just friends now. Nothing's gonna happen again. I promise.
Nothing's gonna happen again. I promise. Scout's honor.
Scout's honor.
So, you guys can go and do whatever it is you do, I don't know,
have your summer fun, and tell June that we're apart, even if we're not apart,
and tell June that we're apart, even if we're not apart, 'cause nothing's gonna happen
'cause nothing's gonna happen and whatever has happened has happened already,
and whatever has happened has happened already, so that's the end of it.
Fine. Then why don't you just go home and leave us all alone?
Then why don't you just go home and leave us all alone?
Okay, see, I tried to be nice. Let me put this a different way
'cause you're not really getting it right now. If you call me a name, if you throw something at me ever again,
If you call me a name, if you throw something at me ever again, if I see you talking to Harlan, yelling at Harlan,
if I see you talking to Harlan, yelling at Harlan, having anything at all to do with Harlan,
having anything at all to do with Harlan, I will find all of your boyfriends and I will fuck them stupid.
I will find all of your boyfriends and I will fuck them stupid.
Okay? Get it? Thanks, guys.
Thanks for your time. Have a good summer.
I am gonna pray for her.
Harlan.
Hi, I'm looking for my wife.
HARLAN: Whose Ferrari is that? RACHEL: My stepfather's here.
Hey. Nice car.
ARNOLD: Rachel.
Just how badly do you hate me to have to live with this lie?
I don't hate you.
You're on private property. Hi, Georgia, I'm...
Just give me a moment, okay?
I shouldn't have agreed to pass you off to someone who you don't even know
to someone who you don't even know just because I didn't have the patience.
I should've taken the time. I should've... I should've been there. What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here? Yeah.
You called me to tell me you're leaving me, and then you hang up?
You called me to tell me you're leaving me, and then you hang up? And you wanna know what I'm doing here?
And you wanna know what I'm doing here?
If I had touched my daughter, I wouldn't be here, would I?
Come on, honey. Please, you...
You know me better than anyone on Earth. She told me...
What did she tell you? What did she tell you?
What did she tell you? That she wasn't using drugs when you found LSD in her room? That she wasn't stealing from you
That she wasn't stealing from you when I found your emerald ring in a pawnshop?
Or... Or that she hadn't been drinking when she crashed her car?
How many lies have I told?
Oh, please. You're a lawyer.
I am fighting for my life, God damn it. Don't speak to her like that.
Don't speak to her like that.
If this was something I couldn't change, an accident, an illness,
If this was something I couldn't change, an accident, an illness, I'd accept it.
I'd accept it. She would not lie about something like this.
She would not lie about something like this.
Would I?
I don't know. Honey. Honey, please. Please.
Honey. Honey, please. Please. No. No.
Put this in your mouth, get in your car... Listen, Georgia.
...and drive! Look, I love your daughter and I love Rachel and I would never do anything to...
and I love Rachel and I would never do anything to... Ow! What are you doing?
What are you doing? You do not take the Lord's name in vain! You do not fool around with little girls! Drive!
You do not fool around with little girls! Drive! I am not moving. I am staying right here. (SCREAMS)
I swear to God, I never touched her. Save it for the appeal. If you don't put that in your mouth soon,
If you don't put that in your mouth soon, I'm gonna... I'm gonna dismantle your car.
Okay! Okay, okay, okay! Okay.
All right. I'm leaving. All right?
I'll be here until Lilly's ready to come home to San Francisco, okay?
What if he's innocent? Oh, it felt really good anyway.
Oh, it felt really good anyway.
Rachel? Rachel?
Can I talk to you? No.
Can you talk to me?
Rachel?
ARNOLD: I'm at the only motel in this town. It's next to the Halfway House Cafe.
It's next to the Halfway House Cafe.
Lil, just... Just hear me out, please.
Rachel will... Will get over her anger and take back this lie one day, but where will you and I be when that happens?
but where will you and I be when that happens? I mean, what kind of life will we have led until that happens?
I mean, what kind of life will we have led until that happens?
I just don't want you to regret not believing me.
But I... I need you here with me, now.
I don't know who to believe.
Well, you have to believe that I wanted her to go to rehab, but you said no, remember?
but you said no, remember? You said you didn't wanna get into your own demons, right?
You said you didn't wanna get into your own demons, right?
That's true.
WAITRESS: Can I get you anything? No, no, thank you. Nothing? No baked potato special?
Nothing? No baked potato special? You're just gonna sit there? Yeah.
You're just gonna sit there? Yeah. It's fine. It's okay. I'll take care of you. Thank you.
It's fine. It's okay. I'll take care of you. Thank you.
I'll do anything to show you how much I love you,
and how easy it is for me to forgive her, okay?
We'll find our way through this. I know we can.
Rachel! Oh, I didn't know where you were.
I was worried. Are... Are you okay?
No, I'm fine. I'm fine, Grandma.
I want you to stay there at Simon's. Yeah.
And I think probably your mom's gonna call, okay? Yeah. Okay, I'll talk to you later.
Yeah. Okay, I'll talk to you later.
I have to go. I'm cooking Simon dinner.
I love you, sweetie. (LINE CLICKS)
Hello?
Who is it? LILLY: Me.
Hi.
I need a bathroom. Okay. Are you okay? Mmm-mmm.
Okay. Are you okay? Mmm-mmm.
This way, make a left. Okay. Right here. On the left. Okay. (RETCHING)
I'll get you water.
Here you go.
I...
It's always so much easier to believe what you need than what you know.
I need Arnold.
He has me convinced.
And you have me convinced.
He finally got his Ferrari, huh?
Help me understand.
I need to just tell you what I feel, because all I saw was how much you loved him.
because all I saw was how much you loved him. How much he loved you.
How much he loved you.
How much he loves me.
And I thought, "How lucky we are."
And I thought, "How lucky we are." I just...
I can't fit... I can't fit what he's done with who I always thought he was.
I can't fit what he's done with who I always thought he was.
I came to tell you I believe you.
I like your hair short. And that none of this is your fault.
And that none of this is your fault.
None of this is your fault.
I really did just say it to make a point.
What?
Simon believed me. Grandma believed me.
Mom, I just wanted to see if you did.
Oh, please.
RACHEL: I screwed up with Vassar. I screwed it all up, and I knew I wasn't ever coming home again.
I screwed it all up, and I knew I wasn't ever coming home again.
And I wanted both of you to pay for my mistakes.
You can be mad at me if you want. And tell him I'm sorry.
He's not even angry with you. He's ready to forgive you.
I might need a little time.
It was good. Thank you. Welcome.
Welcome.
When my mom was too drunk to cook, I used to just take whatever I could find in the fridge
and put it in a pot.
What's going on?
Same old thing.
Well, your mom called. She wants to say good night.
I'm here, home, at Grandma's. Would you come over?
No.
Okay.
Well, good night, then.
Please come back to San Francisco.
No, Mom, not right now.
Rachel, we can't leave it like this. Good night. We have to talk.
Good night. We have to talk. Could I... Could we... Can you call me in the morning?
Could I... Could we... Can you call me in the morning? Yeah, okay.
Yeah, okay.
Okay. Okay.
Goodbye. (DIAL TONE)
You need help, Rachel.
That's why I'm here.
You nearly destroyed your mother with all this, you know?
I'll pay for your therapy. Too late.
Too late.
All right. I'll tell you what, I'll leave my Ferrari here.
All right. I'll tell you what, I'll leave my Ferrari here. We'll take your mother's car and drive it back to San Francisco.
We'll take your mother's car and drive it back to San Francisco. And you can have mine for telling her the truth. How's that sound?
And you can have mine for telling her the truth. How's that sound?
I'm uncomfortable with you in my room. MAN ON TV: And Gonzalez will have himself a base hit.
MAN ON TV: And Gonzalez will have himself a base hit.
As Jared Randall steps in...
Okay. Here's the deal.
If Mom goes back with you, loves being with you, can't live without you, blah, blah, blah,
loves being with you, can't live without you, blah, blah, blah, then that's the end of it.
That's the plan?
Well, if she decides that I'm lying about lying, then you owe me.
Owe you what?
I'm not gonna take you to court or anything. Oh. I won't sue you. No newspapers.
I won't sue you. No newspapers.
I just want you to write her a letter saying that you're sorry about what you did to me. That's it, huh?
That's it, huh?
And a check for $10 million. Mmm. Oh.
Right. That. Of course. I mean, you were always bragging about how much you were worth
I mean, you were always bragging about how much you were worth while we were having our father-daughter time.
while we were having our father-daughter time. Like that would impress me enough to think it was all okay.
Like that would impress me enough to think it was all okay.
I really hope you weren't lying. I hope you're worth $20 million. Because if she decides that you're a piece of shit, which you are,
Because if she decides that you're a piece of shit, which you are, then she gets 10.
Okay.
I'll see you in court.
Along with the videotape.
What are you talking about?
You know, I hate this smell. What are you talking about? (SIGHS)
Remember Tommy? The one that stuck the gun to your head? So, what are you... What are you, wired?
So, what are you... What are you, wired? You have a tape on, is that it? No, nothing. Honest.
No, nothing. Honest.
All right, that... That's enough, Rachel.
See, the thing is, I had him record us. He has a videotape of us.
See, the thing is, I had him record us. He has a videotape of us. Oh, really?
Oh, really?
You, you're all sweaty and grunting and pushing. And me, I'm 14.
Right.
Look, as long as my mother's happy, you win everything. I won't even hold it against you.
I won't even hold it against you.
Keep my mother happy, okay? Okay.
You were thinking? I have a little money saved.
I have a little money saved.
And I'd be glad to pay Rachel's way through college, you know, if that's ever a problem.
you know, if that's ever a problem.
Or if she doesn't need it, I could let you have it. Use it for a down payment on a house, if that's ever a problem.
Use it for a down payment on a house, if that's ever a problem.
Mom, I'm leaving in the morning with Arnold.
Thank you.
Go back to the couch.
I love you.
Please, Simon. No.
It's not like you're family. I'm never gonna have sex with you. All right? Ever. No.
I'm never gonna have sex with you. All right? Ever. No.
I mean, it's not like I haven't thought about it. You know, it's hard not to, Rachel.
You're good at it, this attracting men thing.
And you're beautiful and funny and bright. And God damn him for this! This has nothing to do with him.
This has nothing to do with him. He tried to take away all the things that would let you love me
He tried to take away all the things that would let you love me without being in my bed, like a friend or a father.
This has everything to do with him.
This is about knowing the difference between right and wrong, between the truth and a lie.
between the truth and a lie.
He took that from you.
And if you can't tell the difference, Rachel, then you can't trust anyone.
And if you can't trust, you can't love.
What's it like to be so sure of yourself?
It's... It's good.
Tell me about your wife. Describe it for me.
Describe what?
How you loved her.
When I touched her, I... I felt the best part of me being touched.
It's just a different kind of love, Rachel.
Do you think you'll ever have it again?
No.
Maybe. I don't know. Maybe.
Thanks. For saying no.
Where's your car?
Around the corner. For safety reasons.
If I could lock the windows and doors and keep her from you, I would. I'll wait for her right here.
I'll wait for her right here.
You know I know.
Oh, come on, Georgia. I don't care what Rachel says. I know. And that must eat at you.
I don't care what Rachel says. I know. And that must eat at you.
Having something that disgusting, criminal,
Having something that disgusting, criminal, known out here, exposed, out in the open!
known out here, exposed, out in the open!
If my daughter wasn't in love with you, I would kill you.
I've been calling Rachel for over an hour. It's still busy. Thank you.
Would you give this to her? I didn't seal it. You can read it if you want to.
You can read it if you want to.
I don't want you to go.
I'll call you when I get home.
I noticed the glass bedpan on your mantle.
Yeah, I found room for it.
Thank you.
Hey, boys! Come say goodbye to Lilly.
ETHAN: Goodbye. SAM: Bye, Lilly. Goodbye. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
RACHEL: Who is it?
Coming.
Rachel, why didn't you answer the phone?
I just woke up. Simon's at work already. Did they leave yet?
Simon's at work already. Did they leave yet?
I thought I could... I thought I could let it go, but I can't, Rachel.
You lied to her.
I put together a puzzle without looking at the box.
Look at me. Why? Look at me. You have to tell her the truth.
Look at me. You have to tell her the truth.
Simon says I don't know the difference between the truth and a lie.
Can a lie ever be right? No.
And what happens if I tell the truth?
We're gonna press criminal charges, but it's gonna take the three of us.
Now, come on. Go get dressed. Go on. Well, what makes you think we're gonna catch up to them?
Well, what makes you think we're gonna catch up to them? Well, we're going to try. Simon and Harlan are in the truck
Simon and Harlan are in the truck and she gave me this to give you. No, no, no. Go get dressed.
Okay. You can read this on the way. Hurry!
You can read this on the way. Hurry! What makes you think she's gonna believe me now?
What makes you think she's gonna believe me now? We'll make her. You and I.
We'll make her. You and I.
Maybe I should have driven myself. Yeah, then I would have been tailgating you.
Yeah, then I would have been tailgating you.
What's your hurry?
Well, sending someone back for your car is ridiculous. I might not even do that. It's all too much trouble.
I might not even do that. It's all too much trouble.
Can't leave your car parked on some side street in Idaho. Pull over. You know you want to. It's the right thing to do.
Pull over. You know you want to. It's the right thing to do.
Rachel can have it if she wants.
Rachel? Mmm-hmm.
You love that car. (LAUGHS)
You waited eight months for that car. I don't hold any of this against her, honey. I want her to know that.
I don't hold any of this against her, honey. I want her to know that.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
Pull over.
What? What's the matter with you? You sick or something?
Did you think your Ferrari would be payment enough for her? What? That's... That's not what this is about.
What? That's... That's not what this is about. Get me out of here. Pull over. Come on, honey. Please.
Come on, honey. Please. Pull over! Pull over right now!
Okay, all right, all right! I'm off it. Stop it! Get me out of here!
Get me out of here! Just stop it, Arnold! Honey, stop, Lilly, stop it! All right, all right, I'm doing it! I'm doing it! I'm pulling over! Pull over! Get out. I'm pulling over!
Pull over! Get out. I'm pulling over!
God damn it, Lilly! Talk to me.
Will you... Will you please turn around?
Turn around!
All right, fine! Keep walking.
There's your life. Back in Idaho. With your mother.
She seduced me.
What did you expect me to do? While you were in your drunken stupor?
What did you expect me to do? While you were in your drunken stupor? And guess what? Guess what? She enjoyed it.
And guess what? Guess what? She enjoyed it.
And guess what? Guess what? She enjoyed it. (SCREAMS)
And you wanna take this to trial? You go right ahead. I welcome it.
You go right ahead. I welcome it. You're going to jail, you sick bastard!
You're going to jail, you sick bastard! (ENGINE STARTS)
You can bet on it, pervert!
LILLY: "Dear Rachel, my mother always told me the hardest things to do in life
my mother always told me the hardest things to do in life "are to trust, to have faith, and to forgive.
"So, I want you to hear the strength in my voice when I say I forgive you,
"So, I want you to hear the strength in my voice when I say I forgive you, "because I love you.
"That simple and that complicated.
"To forgive is to move forward. "Georgia rule. Love, Mom."
"Georgia rule. Love, Mom."
I'm sorry, Mommy.
Oh, bunny. Oh, bunny.
I love you.
I'm so sorry.
HARLAN: Ms. Randall. I think you should know that I'm in love with your granddaughter.
And, well, when I get back from my mission, I fully intend to marry her.
This means there's a certain amount of inter-office pressure
to stand around the conference table
eating crappy food and pretending to worship her.
That's so good.
That's so good. Acting for five minutes like Janice doesn't make all our lives miserable
is the hardest work I'll do all day.
My job title is account manager.
I used to be called an account service representative,
but a consultant told us we needed to manage our clients
but a consultant told us we needed to manage our clients and not service them.
(TRAIN RUMBLING) (MOANING)
I have a girlfriend whom I neither manage nor service.
That's my best friend, Barry, fucking her on an IKEA kitchen table
That's my best friend, Barry, fucking her on an IKEA kitchen table I picked up for a really good price.
I'm finding it hard to care about anything these days.
In fact, the only thing I do care about is the fact that I can't care about anything.
Seriously. It worries me.
My name is Wesley Gibson.
My dad walked out on my mom when I was seven days old.
Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked into my baby blues eyes and asked himself,
"Did I just father the most insignificant asshole of the 21st century?"
Well, if you could get me the consignment to me by the 28th... Yeah.
Do you have the numbers in front of you?
Relax. If your name had come up, you'd be dead already.
We've had some unexpected losses recently.
We'd like to know where our competitor is getting his munition.
It's clean. Meaning?
Meaning it's untraceable.
Your competitor's very smart.
(HIGH-PITCHED WHIRRING) Get down!
Fuck it.
No one leaves the Fraternity, Cross.
CROSS ON PHONE: I have a new perspective on the Fraternity.
Careful.
You don't destroy something that's been around for a thousand years.
It's already destroyed. He broke the code.
I have to stop this.
Really? You know this.
So why don't you face me yourself?
Never send sheep to kill a wolf.
They were just the decoys.
Goodbye, Mr. X.
MR. X: Never send sheep to kill a wolf.
They were just the decoys.
CATHY: Wesley! What is it?
What do you mean, "What is it"? Listen.
(RUMBLING) Well, how am I suppose to sleep with all that fucking racket?
When are we gonna move so we don't have to wake up to that shit?
I kind of like it.
WESLEY: It helps to drown out the sound of your annoying, fucking voice.
Now, please, let me sleep.
Have you even thought about our talk?
Yes.
Which one?
Perfect. That's perfect.
Feed Annabelle.
Sorry.
(LAUGHING) Oh, my fucking God.
I hope that's not my billing report sitting on your desk.
Holy shit on an altar, it is.
I want that report on my desk in one hour.
Okay, everybody, we're all gonna stay an extra hour...
WESLEY: Want to hear something sad?
I need an ergonomic keyboard to keep my repetitive stress injury in check.
Just the fact that I repeat something enough
that it causes me stress is fucking sad.
Nice job, dude. You seen Barry?
He had to go to the dentist. Again.
Yes! (MOANING) Barry!
You think they have that morning-after pill here?
That thing works. Crush it up, put it in her omelet,
"Hey, baby, breakfast in bed." You can never be too safe.
Oh, God.
I lost my wallet somewhere.
All this together?
Yes. No, no.
He is the man.
How much is it? Oh. Plus this.
PHARMACIST: $20.42.
(WHISPERING) Watermelon.
Chicks dig it.
Thanks.
See you next time. PHARMACIST: Have a good night.
I love these energy drinks, man.
I'm almost, like, kind of on an energy drink cleanse,
where I do one for breakfast and then, like, two or three for lunch.
WESLEY: I'm the man?
(SCOFFING) Yeah, right, Barry, I'm the man.
In fact, I'm so much the man,
I have a standing prescription for medication to control my anxiety attacks.
God, I wish I had something else to relieve my stress.
Hello, Wesley.
WESLEY: You know, there are people, beautiful people,
you just wish they could see you in a different setting, a different place,
instead of where you are, what you've become.
(WHISPERING) Nicole is so hot.
What?
Boom goes the dynamite.
WESLEY: But most of all, you wish you weren't such a pussy
for wishing for things that will never change.
JANICE: Good God A'mighty, you're over here like it's spring fucking break,
and I still don't have that billing report.
Why do I even keep you around, Wesley?
I'll get it done, Janice.
(SCOFFING) Like I never heard that before. "I'll get it done."
(SCOFFING) Like I never heard that before. "I'll get it done." (HEART BEATING) "I'll get it done. I'll get it done, Janice.
(HEART BEATING) "I'll get it done. I'll get it done, Janice.
"I'll get it done."
(INDISTINCT DISTORTED CHATTERING)
Why don't you have anything to say for yourself?
(DISTORTED) I'm sorry.
Well, you're worthless. I'm the one who's sorry I hired your ass.
WESLEY: You know what the best thing is about the end of the day?
Tomorrow it starts all over again.
Hi. How you doing? Good.
You apologize too much. I'm sorry?
Sorry about that.
I knew your father.
My father left the week I was born, so...
Your father died yesterday on the rooftop of the Metropolitan Building.
Sorry.
Look, the liquor rounds are just over there, so...
Your father was one of the greatest assassins who ever lived.
The man who killed him is behind you.
(HEART BEATING FASTER)
This guy's just shooting up...
Sorry. Sorry.
What... Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What the fuck just happened?
Please! Please! Please drive faster.
Please drive... Please drive faster. Please be quiet.
Please drive... Please drive faster. Please be quiet. Please... Please understand that I care about my life!
Please... Please understand that I care about my life!
I don't know what the fuck you did to piss this guy off,
but you're gonna have to let me out and call the cops!
Hey! Hey! (SIREN WAILING)
What are you doing? Oh, shit! Are you crazy?
Oh, shit!
I think we lost him. I think we lost him.
I think we lost him. I think we lost him. Could you let me out at the next corner, please?
Shit!
Fuck!
Oh, shit!
He's right there!
Look, I'm an accountant. I'm just an accountant.
He's fucking persistent, you know.
Fuck!
You kick his ass!
Shoot him!
What are you doing? What are you shooting our car for, huh?
Are you crazy? Grab the wheel.
Where are you going?
Get back in here!
Oh, my God!
(WESLEY EXCLAIMS) Oh, damn! I'm sorry.
What? Gun!
Under the seat! Here.
Shit! (HEART BEATING)
Look out! Get out! Look out! Oh, my God!
Look out! Oh, my God! Shit!
WESLEY: I'm sorry!
OFFICER: Behind you!
Fuck.
Shit. Shit.
(EXCLAIMS) Hello.
I don't have any money or...
SLOAN: I thought he'd be
taller.
Taller?
Sir...
Sir, I've been trying to explain to the lady here that I'm an accountant.
I'm an account service representative... I'm an account manager.
And I'm sure that if you call my boss, Janice, she'd fill you in on whatever has gone wrong.
she'd fill you in on whatever has gone wrong.
You can contact her by email or... She'll put you straight.
Shoot the wings off the flies.
I don't know what that means.
Shoot the wings off the flies.
I really think you have me mixed up with somebody else. (HEART BEATING)
On three.
Either you shoot, or I do.
One.
Okay.
Two. I can't even see them!
Three.
Okay. Okay.
That's impossible.
SLOAN: A lot of things for you weren't possible before today.
What you experienced, Wesley, was not a panic attack.
Your heart was beating in excess of 400 beats per minute,
sending abundant amounts of adrenaline into your bloodstream.
This allows you to see and react faster than normal.
Only a few people in the world can do that.
Your father could do it and you can do it.
With a little work, you can learn to control these attacks.
Stay away from me.
Just stay back from me. I have a gun, sir. All right?
My name is Sloan.
This is Fox.
And the others you see around you are all very good at killing.
So, if I were you, I'd keep the gun pointed at me.
You don't wanna point it at any of them. That's better.
You're insane. No.
Insanity is wasting your life as a nothing
when you have the blood of a killer flowing in your veins.
Insanity is being shit on, beat down,
coasting through life in a miserable existence
when you have a caged lion locked inside and a key to release it.
This gun you're holding is an Imanishi 17. It belonged to your father.
He could conduct a symphony orchestra with it.
And you're going to use it to kill the man who shot him down in cold blood.
And you're going to use it to kill the man who shot him down in cold blood. I can't... The same man who tried to kill you tonight.
I can't... The same man who tried to kill you tonight.
Your father was one of us.
A fraternity of assassins. The weapons of fate.
We've transferred all of his assets over to you.
And let me assure you, they are substantial.
It is your long-awaited destiny
to join us.
Back off. Back off.
You don't know anything about me.
Stay away from me. Stay away from me.
You stay away from me?
You stay away from me, please? Will you let me through?
WESLEY: You know when you have a dream and you're half awake,
but it's still in the fringe of your brain?
Then you open your eyes and you're so damn glad it was a dream. (CLANKS)
This was nothing like that. (HEART BEATING)
I'm sorry. Could you just give me one second? Thank you.
Oh, shit.
(WHISPERING) Wesley.
Hey.
What's up with you? What do you mean?
You're... You're here early.
Is... You seem a little pepped up.
Well, yeah. You all right?
Yeah.
I guess I feel
kind of different.
Whatever. I'm gonna go get some Post-it Notes. Do you want one?
No. Really?
Yeah. Okay.
Jesus H. fucking Popsicle, I still don't have my billing reports,
but you've got time to sit here and Google your ass off.
Well, I know one thing. You've got your review coming up next week,
and I can't wait to start checking me off some big fucking boxes.
(HEART BEATING) Attitude, poor! Performance, poor!
Management skills, poor!
(SCOFFS) Works well with others. That's a fucking joke. (HEART BEATING FASTER)
What is this bullshit? Who's this prick?
Some loser gets his head blown off at the Metropolitan...
Shut the fuck up!
She has one single iota of tenuous power.
She thinks she can push everyone around.
You don't need this.
(SOFTLY) I understand.
Junior high must have been kind of tough,
but it doesn't give you the right to treat your workers like horseshit, Janice.
I know we laugh at you, Janice.
We all know you keep your stash of jelly donuts in the top drawer of your desk.
But I want you to know
if you weren't such a bitch, we'd feel sorry for you.
I do feel sorry for you.
But as it stands, the way you behave,
I feel I can speak for the entire office
when I tell you
go fuck yourself.
Yeah. That was great, bro. Who's the man?
I'm the man.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
(CHUCKLES)
That's a bad idea.
Couldn't find your keys, huh?
That could be handy. You going to teach me that?
I might need that.
So, Fox, right? What is that? Is that a call sign?
Is it like Maverick in  Top Gun?
You could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?
(LAUGHING) I'm just kidding. (ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES)
SLOAN: Peter!
Check the shuttle rotation on this STB. It should be 300 per minute.
This kind of cotton weave, the opposing thread count should be 4,000.
Hey, this is pretty awesome, huh?
Is it a front?
Front for what? I don't know.
Assassinations.
You may think this is a front for something,
all I can tell you is this is a textile mill.
And George... George, go help Peter up there.
Yeah.
This is a textile mill.
And a damn good one.
WESLEY: Yeah, that's cute, but that's bullshit, right?
I mean, all these guys are killers, aren't they?
I think you owe me some answers.
All right. Clearly I don't understand,
but do you make sweaters or do you kill people?
That's an awful lot of questions over coffee.
Are you sure you're ready for the answers?
Yes, I'm sure.
I can't go back. Not to my life.
SLOAN: He's all yours.
All right. We're up.
How you doing?
I'm The Repairman. What do you repair?
A lifetime of bad habits.
Would you do me a favor? Okay.
Just put your arms behind your back.
Uh... I don't know... It's okay.
I don't know... It's okay. Just behind your back. Is this okay?
REPAIRMAN: Just relax.
WESLEY: Is this part of it?
REPAIRMAN: There we go.
You going to put a bag over my head?
REPAIRMAN: No. There's no need for a bag.
That's not too tight, is it? No, that's nice.
Why did you come here, Wesley? Well, you brought me here, remember?
(GROANING) What the fuck did you do that...
How many punches did The Repairman throw before he was counting sheep?
Well, I haven't spent a lot of time having my face smashed in before, all right?
Well, I haven't spent a lot of time having my face smashed in before, all right? Did you spend a lot of time with knives?
At breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Fuck.
It was a rhetorical question,  culo.
You interrupt me again, I use the business end.
Here's what you need to know,  puto.
Knives are easy to hide.
They don't jam and they never run out of bullets. (COUGHS)
They come in handy
when you have to do some close contact work.
What the fuck, man?
Come here. Come here. What?
WESLEY: What? BUTCHER: Now, try to cut me.
Try to cut me. Hey!
Try to cut me. Hey! Just stick me with that... Be careful with that. That's sharp.
Just stick me with that... Be careful with that. That's sharp.
Why? Just stick and stick and stick.
Why? Just stick and stick and stick. Seriously, man, I could hurt you. Hey!
Okay, pussy. I'm not a pussy. You're a pussy.
I'm not a pussy. You're a pussy. No, I'm not a pussy. You're a pussy!
No, I'm not a pussy. You're a pussy! I'm not a pussy. I got a healthy respect for the human condition.
I'm not a pussy. I got a healthy respect for the human condition.
I'm not a pussy! Fuck that, you pussy!
I'm not a pussy! You're a pussy! I'm not a pussy! Come on, pussy.
Hi. How you doing?
What the fuck?
The fuck! (HUSHING) Just a moment. Just a moment.
(HUSHING) Just a moment. Just a moment.
Sorry. Hello? Hey!
Hello? Hey! Hey, come back! Hey!
You must drink. Drink. Yeah.
What is this? This is the recovery room.
This bath stimulates white blood cells and speed up the process.
In here, bruises, cuts, breaks heal in hours, not days.
You shitting me? Shh.
What is that? Vodka? Yeah.
Are you Russian? Yeah.
Get up.
This is The Gunsmith.
He knows more about a piece than anybody, and he's gonna teach you how to use one.
Pretty good. How you doing?
You know that Seltzer broke his leg? FOX: Oh, really?
Yeah, in three places.
FOX: How'd he do that? GUNSMITH: Jumped off a building.
So, is he okay? Yeah. It's pretty bad, though.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you guys, that is so realistic.
He's been in recovery for, like, three days now,
and they say they're not even gonna let him out.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Hey, we can't shoot a dead woman! She might be somebody's mom... (GUN FIRES)
You need to know what it's like to put a bullet in a body.
FOX: Why are you here?
You know, I thought I was learning to be some kind of super assassin.
You know, if I wanted to get beat up, I would have stayed in my cubicle, you know.
Fuck.
FOX: All right, shoot the target. From there.
You want me shoot through Wilbur?
I want you to curve the bullet.
How am I suppose to do that?
It's not a question of how,
it's a question of what.
If no one told you that bullets flew straight
and I gave you a gun and told you to hit the target,
what would you do?
Let your instincts guide you.
How the hell did he do that?
Can you do that? Can you do that? Hello?
Hey, I think that's my old train.
Still is.
Shit! You fucking asshole!
Shit! You fucking asshole! Come on!
Let's go.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, God, I feel... I feel... I feel...
I feel kind of good.
GUNSMITH: He got Rictus. Perfect shot. Impossible angle.
Cross is taking us out one by one.
And Wesley is the only one who can get to him.
Cross gets closer with each hour.
Get back to work.
FOX: See that?
Okay. It's a shuttle.
I want you to try and catch it.
You want me to stick my hand in there?
Yes. I want you to catch it.
You wanna put a gun to my head? I can just slow things down like with the flies.
You need to learn to control that by yourself.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
This is bullshit! Fuck this!
How's it going today, Wesley?
No. Fuck the loom and fuck The Repairman!
I can shoot the wings off the back of a fly! I'm ready!
You're ready when Fox says you're ready.
Who put her in charge? I did.
Wesley.
People think you use cheese to catch these beauties.
But they go apeshit for peanut butter.
Your father was a big fan of this. Watch.
(WATCH BEEPING)
Plastic explosive and peanut butter!
Sorry, Mickey.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Hey. Hey, Russian.
Good for one. Yeah.
Imagine if you had a thousand.
They really fucked you up, didn't they?
What the hell did they do to you?
Throw you in front of a moving train for no reason? (WHISTLING)
Beat the shit out of you?
You know, you can say it, this place is bullshit. It's bullshit, huh?
You know, you can say it, this place is bullshit. It's bullshit, huh? Bullshit! (WATER SPLASHING SOFTLY)
Repairman. Five minutes.
Heads up out of the question?
You're a waste of my fucking time! Why are you here?
I don't know, so hit me.
I had a shit life, so why wouldn't I? Why are you here?
I wanna kick your fucking ass!
Tell me what you want me to say.
I don't know! FOX: Why are you here?
Why are you here?
I don't know why I'm here. Why are you here?
Why are you here?
Why are you here? I don't know who I am.
I don't know who I am.
What did you say? I said...
I said I don't know who I am.
Do you really want to know who you are?
Yeah. It's my room.
No.
This was your father's room.
WESLEY: What happened?
A member of this fraternity went rogue.
Cross.
He started by killing the one man who was better than him.
Your father.
Blindsided him on a rooftop.
Betrayed him.
Everything in this room,
books, weapons, clothes,
belonged to him.
Now they belong to you.
Find a connection in this room, Wesley.
It may be the only way of finding out who you are.
WESLEY: Now I know why I could never care about anything before this.
I was living a lie.
Finally, I have a chance to step into my father's shoes.
Grow a pair. Live the life I was born to live.
I've been pissing it all away like it was another fucking billing report.
I have to train harder.
I have to be as good as my father.
On these shelves, Wesley, are the records of the Fraternity kills,
everything you will need to kill your target.
WESLEY: To kill Cross,
the man who betrayed the Fraternity and murdered my father, I must prepare.
I have to become his student, memorize every move he ever made,
every attack he ever executed.
When he dropped a patient in an airtight room surrounded by Secret Service agents.
When he took out that businessman in the elevator.
His bullets untraceable, of course.
Or how no matter what the weapon or how he eliminated his target,
he was always one chess move ahead.
One move more prepared.
One step quicker.
One shot more precise.
In fact, in all my research, I found that he never missed a target.
Not until me.
Yeah!
First time in your life, Wesley, you're in control.
Shoot the target.
You're crazy.
Welcome to the Fraternity.
SLOAN: We call this the Loom of Fate.
After today, you will never set foot in here again.
Why not?
Because, like an apostle,
your task is not to interpret, but to deliver.
Every culture in history has a secret code,
one you won't find in traditional texts.
A thousand years ago,
a clan of weavers discovered a mystical language hidden in the fabric.
They called themselves the Fraternity.
I'll be honest with you, all I see are threads.
Come here.
Look there.
Do you see that one thread that missed the weave
and lies on top of the others?
Like a mistake? No, it's a code.
If the vertical thread is on top, it's a one.
If it's below, it's a zero.
Binary code?
What does it say? It's a name.
A target.
Where do the names come from?
Come out of a necessity, Wesley.
A necessity to maintain balance in the world.
They are orders that must be executed,
entrusted to us so that we might forge stability out of chaos.
This one is yours.
I don't...
Look, I thought you brought me here to kill Cross.
You will. In time.
This is your first assignment.
The loom provides, I interpret,
you deliver.
You want me to kill Robert Deane Darden?
Not me. Fate.
FOX: The target will be in the conference room, sitting at the head chair.
There are six windows. You will shoot through the fifth.
Fifth window.
Now.
WESLEY: What did he do that he deserves to die?
You don't know.
I don't know if he was bad, I don't know if he was evil.
I don't know anything about him.
We get our orders from a loom. Fate.
And we're suppose to take it on faith that what we're doing is right.
Killing someone we know nothing about,
I don't know if I can do that.
About 20 years ago, there was this girl.
Her dad was a federal judge,
so she probably had it in her mind that she was gonna follow in his footsteps.
So she's home one Christmas,
and her dad's on this big racketeering case.
The defendants want to get a softer judge.
One they can buy off.
So they hire this guy,
Max Petridge,
get him to pay her father a visit.
And the way he pays people a visit
is to break in
(INAUDIBLE)
and tie up their loved ones,
and force them to watch
while he burns his targets alive.
And then he takes a wire hanger and twists it round
and brands his initials into each one of them so they will never ever forget.
After I was recruited into the Fraternity,
I found out that Max Petridge's name had come up
weeks before the federal judge was killed,
and that a Fraternity member had failed to pull the trigger.
We don't know how far the ripples of our decisions go.
You kill one, and maybe, save a thousand.
That's the code of the Fraternity.
That's what we believe in, and that's why we do it.
Cross. Not yet.
FOX: Your target will be in a black limo.
He always travels the same six blocks of Halsted.
You have three blocks to kill him. (HONKING)
(GUNSHOTS) Shit.
I'm sorry.
CATHY: Barry! Could you feed Annabelle?
Barry!
Wesley. Hey, where have you been? I have really missed you, man.
Look at the big man. You fucking asshole! What?
What? You don't show up for weeks,
now you're just gonna stop by and use the bathroom?
You think you're a real big shot now, huh? No. You know what? You are nothing!
No. You know what? You are nothing! No, you are less than nothing.
You're not even half the man that Barry is.
Barry, he pleases me in ways that you've never even heard of!
Who the hell is she, Wesley? Your new whore?
Who the hell is she, Wesley? Your new whore? Is that what it takes now? You're paying for it?
Is that what it takes now? You're paying for it?
Wesley?
He's the man.
Yeah. You all right?
Yeah. I'm okay. Go sit down. I'm gonna find a car.
Big night. I got to get into recovery.
Shit.
Fuck!
Bull's-eye.
REPAIRMAN: What's he doing here?
Come on. Just stay with us. Come on! FOX: Pull back his jacket.
FOX: Pull back his jacket.
REPAIRMAN: Breathe. Breathe, all right?
(GASPING) FOX: It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
A thousand.
REPAIRMAN: Come on!
Come on! FOX: No! No! Stay with us. GUNSMITH: Open your eyes! Come on.
REPAIRMAN: Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
This bullet is the first traceable bullet he's ever used.
It was made by this man. His name is Pekwarsky.
He works out of what is now a monastery in Eastern Moravia.
This place is where the Fraternity was born.
He's taunting me.
He's sending me a message. I'm gonna send him one back.
He's trapping you.
Leading you to a place he knows very well.
Look, I know this. I...
This is what you trained me for.
You can't go alone.
I go alone or he doesn't show. He's not stupid.
Look, a member of the Fraternity is dead because of me.
SLOAN: Okay.
Go.
Thank you.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Your next assignment.
Pekwarsky?
WESLEY: Shit.
What are you doing here?
(GUN COCKING) FOX: Lower your gun.
WESLEY: You recognize this?
I pulled this out of my shoulder.
The guy who put it there killed my father.
Now, I know you made it, so tell me where he is.
I did mold this, but I can't be responsible for the people who use them.
I don't give a shit. Tell me where he is.
Look at my finger.
I can try and arrange a meet.
Have you ever thought about doing things differently?
How do you mean?
I don't know.
Being somebody else.
Somebody normal.
No.
Shit.
Out of the way!
Stay.
Hey!
He's on the train.
He's alone. Thank you.
(EXCLAIMS) (PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sit down!
Sir, sit down! Nobody's gonna get hurt.
Sir, sit... Sit down! Sir, sit down!
Get out of the way! Sit down! Stay down! Stay down!
Stay down! It's okay! Sit down!
(WHISPERING) Wesley.
Out of the way! Out of the way!
WESLEY: No, no, no!
Wesley, listen to me.
Shut the fuck up!
You don't get to talk to me. You don't get to talk to me.
Everything they told you was a lie.
Shut up, you lying piece of shit. You shut the fuck up.
You are my son. (GASPING)
What did you say? What did you say to me?
Is it true?
Yes.
Why did you make me do this?
Because you are the only person he wouldn't kill.
You knew, God damn it.
You knew the entire time.
Well, his name came up.
So did yours.
No, it was okay. Never mind.
No. No, it was complete shit.
I promised your father I'd bring you back here.
What the fuck?
He said it was the only way you'd believe.
Your father was never more than a camera click away.
That's me.
He was my father.
And I killed him.
To your father, protecting you was worth giving up his life.
Protect me?
He was trying to fucking kill me!
No. He wasn't trying to kill you.
He was trying to rescue you.
PEKWARSKY: When Cross left the Fraternity,
Sloan hunted you down.
Ever since Fox had her teeth in you, he's been trying to separate you from them.
Your father never wanted you in the Fraternity, Wesley.
He wanted a different path for you,
with things that he could never have.
A home.
Peace. No.
He hoped you would find your own way.
Your father got hold of this.
Decipher it yourself.
Sloan began manufacturing targets of his own for profit years ago.
Your father found out about it.
And he was going to do something about it on his own, right?
But Sloan turned everyone against him.
My father's name never even came up, did it?
No. Holding to the code made him a target.
Yes.
No. You want me to run?
I want you to live.
You can have a different life, Wesley.
Like your father wanted for you.
We trained him well.
WESLEY: My father was wrong about one thing.
Everything they told me wasn't a lie.
They taught me how to kill, how to feel no pain,
and most importantly, that every job has a perfect weapon.
Well, I'm the perfect weapon.
And I'm supposed to run?
No, I've been doing that my entire life.
So I say no.
I say kill them all and let fate sort out the mess.
Kill him.
He's here!
BUTCHER: Pussy.
Pussy, pussy.
Pussy, pussy.
Pussy.
Sloan!
My father wasn't a traitor.
This is a kill order.
And it's got Sloan's name on it.
What did you say to me?
It's a name. It's a target.
I don't want this person dead.
Fate does.
(LAUGHS) Fate wanted you dead.
And he couldn't take it.
So he started manufacturing his own targets for his own gains.
And that's when my dad found out and decided to stand against him.
And that's when you sent a man's son
to kill his father.
You're not an assassin of fate, Sloan.
You're just a thug who can bend bullets.
Is that true?
Here is what the truth is.
Your name came up.
Your name came up.
Your name came up.
Your name.
Your name. Yours.
Everyone in this room.
If I had not done what I did,
you would all be dead.
I saved your lives.
Now look where we are. We are stronger than ever.
Changing the course of history as we see it.
Choosing the targets we select.
We can redistribute power where we see fit.
The wolves rule.
Not the sheep.
Now, if any of you feel the need to follow the code
of the Fraternity to the letter,
I invite you to take your gun, put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.
put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.
That is what Wesley demands.
Otherwise, shoot this motherfucker
and let us take our Fraternity of Assassins to heights
and let us take our Fraternity of Assassins to heights reserved only for the gods of men.
You choose.
Fuck the code.
Sloan!
Sloan! (HEART BEATING SLOWER)
WESLEY: Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic.
Just like you.
But who am I now?
Account manager?
Assassin?
Or just another tool who was mind-fucked into killing his father?
I am all of these.
And I am none of these.
Who am I now?
This is not me fulfilling my destiny. (PEOPLE CHATTERING)
This is not me following in my father's footsteps.
This is definitely not me saving the world.
Still trying to figure out who you are?
WESLEY: This is not me.
This is just a motherfucking decoy.
Oh, fuck. (GRUNTS)
This is me taking control.
From Sloan,
from the Fraternity,
from Janice, from billing reports,
from ergonomic keyboards,
from ergonomic keyboards, from cheating girlfriends and sack-of-shit best friends.
This is me taking back control
of my life.
You may have encountered some of them already.
You may have bumped into or spoken with some.
Or perhaps you may not have noticed them at all.
Whether you know them or not,
each one of them has their own story.
Their own joys and sorrows.
But they all yearn for one thing.
To give love, to fall in love,
and above all, to be loved.
To find that person
who can give meaning to their life.
Someone to be with through thick and thin.
They will do everything just to find that person
who is meant for them.
They're willing to search anywhere
just to find the one destined for their love.
This is just one of the many stories
about finding happiness
and true love.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Oh, my God…
What's happening to you?
He looked at me!
Who?
The guy on the train.
Have you talked to him already?
No, he just looked.
Don't be so obvious!
You've been eyeing that guy for a month now but--
Are you crazy? You think I'm that cheap?
I'm not like that, Stefi!
And what do you think you're doing?
I can't just approach him and introduce myself--
So, you expect him to make the first move?
But, Stefi, I'm a girl.
He doesn't even know you exist!
Betchay, you better do something about it now!
You won't get anywhere by being demure!
Hello?
What are you looking at?
Oh, no…
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Make way, please.
Where is he?
-I'm really sorry! -Watch it!
Here's a kiss! Bye!
Taxi!
-Excuse me. -Hey! This is our cab, okay?
‎Just an emergency. -Even if it is emergecy, this is our cab! -We don't care!
-Even if it is emergecy, this is our cab! -We don't care!
I'm just dizzy…
-Seriously? -My God…
Thanks! I'm really sorry.
Where to, miss?
Sir?
Do you really know which cab we're following?
Yes, you pointed at it.
But which one? There are three cabs in front of us!
The white one.
But they're all white!
-Which one? -The one on the left…
with yellow stripes.
That's right. Keep following it. Don't let it run too far.
-You want me to go near it? -Please don't! My goodness!
-Just keep tailing it! Not be beside it. -Okay. Relax.
-Hey, I'm driving! Relax! -Okay…
-Okay. Just keep driving. -Relax. ‎-Okay, relax. ‎-Just keep tailing it.
-Mike? -Yes?
May I ask you a question?
Why are you pouring alcohol on your desk?
I ate a sandwich earlier.
It might attract cockroaches.
Mike, there are no cockroaches here.
Well, they don't show up in the morning
because they're sensitive to light.
They usually come out when it's dark.
-Don't you know that? -No.
I don't have a pet cockroach…
so there's no way for me to know that.
By the way, your cousin is waiting for you outside.
Dude, it's just a date, man.
I'm not telling you to get her pregnant.
Jacob, why do you always drag me to these dates?
-I'm just doing this to help you. -Help me? With what?
You know, Uncle Oscar and Auntie Lucille talked to me.
What did they tell you?
They don't mind that you don't have a girlfriend.
They're worried that you don't have a girl at all!
What's wrong if I can't find a girl who's--
Hello!
Come on, are you even looking for one?
Okay, it's not my priority right now.
You see? That's not normal.
It's always a guy's priority to find a woman!
-Just go back to your office. -Dude.
You have to get over that girl.
Who?
Who else but your one and only girlfriend back in college!
What's her name again? Katherine?
The one you love so much, but she left you.
That's not what happened. She just went to the States.
-So, she did leave you! -Yes! I'm leaving now!
What? You stalked him?
I did not stalk him, I just followed him.
-Hi, Betsy! -Hi!
It's not stalking. I just did a bit of research.
Is that the guy from the train?
Well…
Stefi told me to make the first move.
And your idea of a first move is to scare him?
He didn't see me. I was careful.
Whatever.
You know what your problem is? You listen to Stefi too much.
If she's such an expert when it comes to guys,
how come her relationships don't last long?
You're confusing me. When I wasn't doing anything,
you said I was stupid.
Now that I'm trying to be aggressive, you think I'm crazy!
-What do you want-- -Hey! That hurts!
I'm sorry.
Betsy, I haven't met an accountant who's exciting.
Well, he's different.
Betchay, there are a lot of handsome guys out there.
When I go out in Makati, I see a lot of cute guys!
Tell me, where are they? Why are they all hiding from me?
I've had enough, Stefi!
I'm tired of dressing up every Friday and Saturday night…
Excuse me!
You put on makeup, go to a bar and smile,
while you endure the stupidity of guys out there.
You talk as if you go on a lot of dates.
Is this okay?
It suits you. Hey, try this one.
Who's that?
I bet it's your clingy girlfriend again.
What's her problem?
I thought she's supposed to be at work.
Let me see!
Well, she cares.
-Like Care Bears? Hello? -Care Bears?
-You know what? Oops, sorry! -Ouch!
-That hurts, Betsy! -You know, Martin?
There's nothing wrong with what Maritess is doing.
But please tell her…
she doesn't have to be jealous of us!
-Why did you hurt me, Betsy? -Wait a minute.
We're talking about your love life, not mine.
-Excuse me. -Get off my back.
Betchay has no love life except…
for that accountant in her fantasies.
-Correction. -Let's go this way!
He only works in that building.
-It doesn't mean he's an accountant. -Cute.
Okay, if you're so sure about this guy,
why don't you make a move already?
Please answer.
Stefi!
Come on, Betsy!
Let's face it, guys are getting fewer and fewer each day.
And in this day and age,
it shouldn't come as a shock to everyone
that a girl makes the first move.
So, what's your plan?
I don't have one. ‎I'm still waiting for a sign.
A sign?
Yes, a sign.
When the right man comes along, there will be a sign.
That's what I pray for every night.
Lord, give me a sign.
Oh, well, the Lord can't answer you
because he's busy.
-He's out of town. -Yes.
My goodness, Khalil got drunk again.
Dad, what are you doing?
Writing a letter for the newspaper.
Another letter to the editor?
I need to do this, dear.
Take a look at this.
Look. They published the last letter I sent…
without any revisions!
This was about the dumpsite in San Mateo.
But Dad, what does that dumpsite have to do with you?
Elizabeth,
you need to be concerned about the issues in our country.
Just take your mom for example.
She dedicated her life to her countrymen.
It's instinct.
As they say, if you have an instinct,
there's truth to what you're feeling.
Why don't you just ask your girlfriend?
She's cheating on me!
Ever since she started working, she has really changed--
And when she met her boss from New York,
she has changed even more!
Friend Lord…
you've always known what I'm praying for.
Please let me meet the man of my life.
The only one who deserves my love
and who will love me back.
Friend Lord, just give me a sign!
Please let us have any kind of contact tomorrow!
I hope I get to see him!
I'll be honest with you, dude.
I liked your parents better…
before they joined that church group.
Seriously?
Before my parents joined that group,
they wanted to kill each other.
Remember that time when my mom
threw an iron at my dad?
And there was a time my dad pointed a gun at my mom.
Remember?
Exactly.
At least they used to be normal.
Now, dude…
all they do…
is wait for the Rapture.
And look at yourself!
You're starting to be like them!
You look like a missionary who makes Bible deliveries.
How do you expect girls to like you?
Why don't we get some frappé?
-It's too hot today! -All right, let's go!
Hey, aren't you coming?
No, go ahead. I don't drink coffee, anyway.
It might give me anxiety and I might have trouble sleeping.
Go ahead, I'll be fine.
-Fine. -Okay.
Ouch…
Dude, she may be eighteen, but she's one of a kind.
You're such a pervert.
You really want to ruin that girl's life?
You're crazy.
No, dude, she's from Europe.
I was shocked. She seemed to know more than I do.
You want me to set you up with her?
Let's just go.
Hang on, I need to pee. I'll be back, okay?
Mocha, vanilla…
Hey…
Wait…
-I thought you didn't want-- -He's here!
-Who? -The sign! The guy from the train!
The sign…
-Who? -Where is he?
-He might see you. -Where?
Don't worry. I got this.
What would you do?
He's wearing an ID, right? Do you want to know his name?
Okay, go.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hi.
Bye.
You see that girl?
Trust me, she wants your body.
So, did you get his name? What is it?
-Talk, or else I'll dump this on you! -Hey!
Come on, tell me!
Morelos.
Comma. Michael.
His name is Michael Morelos.
-Are you happy now? -Michael Morelos…
Elizabeth.
You know my name?
My thoughts are with you, every second…
-every minute, -every minute,
-every hour of every day. -every hour of every day.
-Betchay. -What's going on with you?
You're being possessed again…
Michael Morelos.
Michael Morelos.
Lord, please. One more sign.
Just one more sign, please.
What is it?
You want to meet Morelos, Michael, right?
Well, guess what?
My God, Estefania! What did you do?
I met his cousin at Slumber Bar and we set up a double date with you!
-What? -Yes, you're going on a date with him!
We're going on a date!
That's great…
We're going on a date!
Hurry up!
They're here!
-Smile… -I think I'm going to faint.
Try doing that and I'm going to leave you.
We're sorry, the traffic was terrible.
Even parking is a hassle.
You know what, it's okay 'cause it's a Friday night.
By the way,
Betsy, this is Jacob.
And this is his cousin…
-What's your name again? -Michael.
Michael Morelos.
I know.
Pardon?
I said, now I know that you're Mr. Morelos.
Morelos, Michael.
Yes!
Okay.
So, what movie are we catching, dudes?
Oh, dudes, you know what?
You decide. You decide on that.
I think I like Haunted Sweethearts.
I like Haunted Sweethearts, too.
Haunted Sweethearts?
Horror movie?
Yes!
There it is!
Hey, tell me, is the girl dead?
How would you know if you keep hiding behind your bag?
But I don't want to see it. So, is the girl dead?
There, she's dead.
-There. Look. -No…
How did she die?
How did she die?
Only you
Until there's love
My heart will yearn
Only for you
Wow, you sing with so much heart!
Of course, that song has a personal meaning to me.
You want me to sing more?
‎-You want more? ‎-That's enough, sis.
I'm having a migraine and you've sung three songs already.
Pass me the mic.
Mikey, it's your turn.
-No, it's okay. -What?
Excuse me.
Wait! Where are you going?
-Where are you going? -I just need some air.
-It won't take long. -Mikey, boy, just one song!
-No, thanks. Excuse me. -What's the matter?
Yes?
Are you okay?
Yes.
May I sit beside you?
Okay.
I went out because I was feeling claustrophobic.
Actually, Stefi doesn't really sing.
It's just that nobody has the guts to tell her about it.
Her singing gave me a headache.
Me, too!
In fact, at her sister's wedding reception,
they made a mistake by letting her sing.
She sang three songs of Celine Dion…
so the reception ended early.
And you know what…
Sorry…
I guess my story makes you sleepy.
Not at all. I'm just tired from work.
And the train we ride at Magallanes leaves early.
Don't you agree?
You're aware that we take the same train from Magallanes?
Of course.
Since when?
When we were at the movie house.
Really?
Let's go.
Where?
When I was a kid, my dad used to love fishing.
But he wasn't any good at it.
My mom said we should just buy fish from the market.
That way, we get to pick the fish that we want
without my dad getting sunburnt!
You know, I miss that.
Ever since my mom left,
we weren't able to go fishing anymore.
You know, I don't get tanned whenever I get sunburnt.
My skin just turns red like a crab!
I would like to hear your stories.
What stories?
Don't you have a story to tell?
I don't.
That's impossible!
Life is filled with stories!
Some of which may be sad, funny, or plain boring.
But in life, there's always a story to tell!
Well, sometimes,
you get to know a person better if you both stay silent.
That's deep.
You're deep.
I like that!
Why don't you--
Sorry.
I would love to hear more. You tell good stories, anyway.
What else can I share?
Did you know that my brother has had three suicide attempts already?
Why?
Because his wife left him. She went with another woman.
So, this is your place?
-You want to come in-- -Thank you.
Good night.
So…
What now?
I said…
What now?
Thank you for the evening.
Good night, Betsy.
Okay.
Shall I give you a call?
When?
When will you call me?
What?
I mean…
I'm currently training at a call center.
I might get the job soon and--
Betsy. I have your number.
‎-Okay. ‎-All right.
Good night.
Good night.
Oh, wait. Hang on.
Just a souvenir.
All right. Good night.
-Take care. -Okay.
Good night.
You chickened out again. Why don't you call her?
-Don't you think she's pretty? -I do, but…
What is it?
Come on, dude.
I just don't think she's my type.
She talks too much and she's not very ladylike.
She's just outgoing.
Being outgoing is different from being hyperactive.
Right?
I like a girl who's modest.
Reserved.
Someone who seems helpless…
Mikey?
Kat?
Dude, I'll just wait for you in the car.
How are you?
My God, it's so nice to see you again.
I'm okay.
I'm okay. How about you?
I'm good.
This is… This is so weird.
I know.
I thought you were still in the States.
I went home with my mom.
Since when? I mean…
-Why didn't you tell me? -Well, Mikey--
Were you able to find that olive oil?
Mikey, this is Ralph, my fiancé.
Ralph, this is Mikey.
A friend of mine from way, way back.
Hey, man.
Hey.
Actually, there's a reason why I'm here.
Ralph and I are getting married next month.
Oh, is that… Really?
Wow…
-Congratulations! -Thank you.
We'll go ahead, man. We still have something to look at.
Yes, I'll go ahead, too. My cousin is waiting for me.
Should I call him? Just a friendly call!
I'll just check on him.
Check on him? Does he have some kind of terminal disease?
What if he lost my number?
But I thought you gave it to him?
What if it got deleted?
Betchay,
according to Jacob, his cousin is really like that.
A bit of a weirdo.
Wait a second!
Ouch! Can you give us a minute?
When did you talk to Jacob?
We went out again last night.
-Hey, hold it right there! -Ouch! Stop pulling my hair!
That seems unfair!
Aren't you supposed to set me up with Michael?
How come it's you and Jacob who are getting along well?
They need this ASAP.
Stefi, look!
Ouch!
Answer it.
Hi, there! How are you?
Betsy?
-Yes? -Okay…
You called?
I'm sorry…
I was calling someone else, but I must have dialed the wrong name.
Mike.
-So, how are you? -Can you give me Mrs. Cervantes' files?
I'm okay.
You're in the office?
-Thank you. -Yes.
You're working?
You could say that.
Are you busy?
Sort of.
Okay.
Sorry, Betsy, I'll just call you some other time.
I have to go.
-Sure. -Okay.
-Take care. Bye. -Okay, bye.
What did he say?
He said he's busy…
and he'll call me some other time.
I hate you, Stefi!
-Ouch. -Why didn't you stop me from calling him?
Quezon Avenue, please.
One moment.
-Hurry up, the train is arriving. -Hang on, my wallet is missing.
Then step out of the line.
But I need to catch that train.
Here.
No, it's okay.
Are you going to buy a ticket or not?
Just take it.
Thank you, Betsy! I'll pay you back!
Excuse… Excuse me.
Hey! Chito!
Let's grab some lunch! Your treat!
Let's go! You can do that later.
Miss, where can I find Groundwood International Call Center?
Twelfth floor.
Betsy!
Betsy!
Michael!
-I'm okay. -Are you all right?
-Are you okay? -Sorry…
-I just-- -What are you doing here?
Someone returned my wallet.
So, I thought…
I will pay you back.
-Okay. -Thank you.
You're welcome.
Bye.
Betsy, have you eaten already?
Not yet. Why?
You want to have lunch with me? My treat.
Actually, the job at the call center is only temporary.
I really want to go abroad.
I have a Physical Therapy degree, but I still need to save up.
So, I took this job because their starting salary is high.
Besides, my parents are against my plans of leaving.
My mom would probably kill me
if she finds out I want to leave for the States.
She doesn't like Americans because she's too patriotic.
-How so? -Like I said,
it has been six months since we last talked to her.
Before she even joined the movement,
she was already a veteran activist.
She has been tear-gassed, jailed for illegal assembly,
hospitalized six times because of riots,
and was struck by a police baton!
I've never been to the States, but I like it there already.
Hang on.
I'll show you a photo of my cousin's house in the States.
Where is it? It should be…
Just a moment…
Where is it…
-My goodness… -Is this your mom?
Yes.
Why do you carry all these things with you?
For practical reasons, of course.
If you have a headache, I have paracetamol,
anti-allergy, and antacid.
And if you need a pen,
take your pick, 24 colors!
Thanks for the treat. I hope we can do this again.
Sure.
Your office is near mine. So, why not?
Yes, it's just a short walk from here.
You know where my office is?
Well, you said it's near, right?
Well, thanks again. I have to go back.
Bye.
Betsy, are you doing something on Saturday night?
No.
Why do you ask?
We're not from the province.
All Filipinos…
have ancestral roots from the province.
So, where's yours?
My mom's family is originally from Davao.
Is she a Muslim?
-No. -Is she pro or anti-abortion?
What?
What's her take on family planning?
Well, my parents are very religious.
Opus Dei?
No.
What's with the outfit?
You look like a gay man.
-Shut up… -Hey!
Where are we going?
I've long been wanting to come back here.
They serve great food for such a cheap price!
But…
I can see that you really dressed up for this date.
Oh, not really.
You're all dolled up.
Of course, I want to look good for my date and…
I want him to notice me.
Well, you've succeeded in your mission.
Hey, that's enough.
-Why? -You've had a lot already.
See? You're tipsy.
This is nothing! We're a family of heavy drinkers!
And look at yourself! You're the one who's tipsy!
You've only had two bottles, but you look flushed already!
Wait…
-Hold on. -What are you doing?
There!
Wish! They say that if you catch an eyelash,
you can make a wish!
Wait…
I caught one, too.
What was your wish?
I would rather not say.
Let's drink.
Okay.
Just go to sleep. You're drunk.
I already told you, beer doesn't get me drunk, okay?
I'll give you a call.
Next time, you don't have to announce it.
Just do it, okay?
Betsy!
Betsy…
If you plan on doing something, go ahead and do it.
I wouldn't mind.
You're unbelievable.
Yes, I am one of a kind.
Was that okay?
That felt like a grandma's kiss.
You should probably go inside.
Your parents might think we're on to something.
Don't worry, I'm sure they've done this back in their day.
You should go.
You've been saying goodbye, but you're still here!
-Bye! -Bye!
-Good night. -Good night.
Betsy!
What…
Good night, Betsy.
Some scientific studies have proven
that the feeling of being in love
is only caused by a chemical reaction.
Is it really just a chemical reaction?
A reaction that makes you feel like every song
is written for your love story?
Why do people in love seem to be over the moon…
and walking on the clouds?
Hey.
-Hi, Khalil. -What are you doing?
Life is so beautiful, isn't it?
Are you drunk again?
Each day is marked with happy memories.
Every moment becomes a chapter of a story
filled with love and meaning.
In the name of love, why can we suddenly do things
we thought we were incapable of doing?
Why do we suddenly become patient and brave?
Most of all, why does it make us happy?
It makes us so happy, am I right?
And they started chasing each other with bolos!
Can you imagine?
My siblings and I were all hiding out of fear. What if you got chased?
But, you know…
the only thing I prayed for…
was for them to break up.
Just to end the mess.
So, that's why you're so sad.
Betsy…
what are you talking about?
I'm okay. It's all in the past.
Stop crying.
It doesn't suit you.
Michael?
Since we're talking about the past,
I have a question for you.
Have you ever been in a serious relationship?
Do you really have to ask that?
Of course, I don't want any secrets between us.
Don't worry, I won't get mad.
Please?
The answer is yes. That's enough, okay?
What was she like?
Beautiful? Kind? What did you like about her?
Betsy, you can ask me about anything…
…except that.
Fine.
What did you like about me?
Betsy…
Is it because I'm beautiful?
I'm kind, sincere, honest, and sensitive, am I not?
Why are you laughing at me?
Oh, I got it.
Is it because you're happy when we're together?
Am I right? Tell me!
Too much…
Too much?
You have too much self-confidence!
Admit it! You're happy when you're with me!
-Right? Come on! -Fine! Yes!
I already said yes.
We need to reconcile those books before 11 a.m. on Friday.
Because…
Because the officers of Hermes Trading will be here.
To…
They expect us to explain the…
Whose phone is that?
I can't concentrate, it's too distracting!
Whose is it?
-Michael? -Ma'am?
-Turn it off. -Yes, ma'am.
-Now! -Yes, ma'am.
Sorry. So annoying!
‎-Hello? ‎-Why aren't you replying to my texts?
Why can't I reach you? Where have you been?
I'm here in the office.
As far as I know, there are no dead spots in your office.
Keep it down!
I turned off my phone during the meeting.
I forgot to turn it back on.
Michael, follow me.
Wait, I have to go. I'll call you later. I'm just busy now.
-You're overreacting! -Thank you.
He already told you he's at work.
What did you expect?
Well, what about me? I'm busy too, but I still make time for him!
You know, Betchay, a normal person wouldn't send
300 texts a day to someone he's obsessed with!
Right! Aside from that,
why do you always have to check on him?
You're not a doctor and he's not sick!
You're starting to annoy him!
She's like your girlfriend who's also addicted to texting!
True! My goodness!
She's too much!
I'm not annoying. ‎I'm just being thoughtful, okay?
He's the one taking me for granted.
-Okay? -Okay…
Are you mad at me?
You weren't replying to my texts.
I've been calling your office phone, but the line is always busy.
I've tried calling your cell, but you're rejecting my calls.
At least now you know how it feels.
My God, Betsy, please be reasonable.
Just because I don't pick up your calls or reply to your texts,
it doesn't mean I don't want to talk to you. It doesn't mean I don't want to talk to you.
We had a deadline, okay?
You know what? Never mind.
Let's not talk about this.
Forget it.
Did you come here to argue or to apologize?
Okay.
I'm sorry.
What kind of apology is that? It doesn't sound sincere.
What do you want me to do?
You want me to get down on my knees?
Okay. Here.
Betsy, I'm sorry.
That's too much…
What's wrong with your hand?
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes, I'm okay.
Okay.
-I'll get that. -No, I got it.
-Come on. -I'll do it.
Suit yourself. ‎Excuse me.
How long have you been friends with my son?
Just recently.
Well, he never mentions anything about you.
Come to think of it, Mikey hardly tells us anything.
He's always in his room with his computer.
By the way, is your family affiliated with a church group?
We're not.
What do you mean?
My family is not really religious.
We're more socially conscious than religious.
Oh, that's okay.
You know,
God is always in our hearts and in our spirits.
So, even if you rarely go to church,
if Jesus is in your heart and your spirit,
that should suffice.
But I assume you're Catholic, even if you're not active in church?
We are.
But…
But what?
We stopped discussing religion at home
ever since my mom joined the movement.
Movement? As in…
the rebel movement?
Oh, yes! In fact, my godfather holds one of the top positions in the NPA.
And my mom joined them.
Your mom joined them?
Yes. They went to live in the mountains.
You told my mom that your mom's a communist?
Yes.
You told me to just be myself when I'm talking to them.
Are you sure about your decision? It may just be a petty fight.
-Stefi is right. -No, we're done.
It's the end.
You've been in a relationship with Maritess for two years,
and you're just ending it like it's nothing?
Well, I finally came to my senses. I've had enough.
Come on, let me see how this looks.
Martin, you've been playing the martyr for so long,
but you've realized that just now?
But you know what?
It actually feels good after having a lovers' quarrel…
because you get to be sweet to your partner again.
Look at you.
Just because you got that accountant under your spell,
you think you're a love guru?
-Hey, that's harsh. -She's right!
But you know,
I still argue with Michael for the pettiest reasons.
What?
Why would you do that?
I noticed we become sweeter with each other after we make up.
And if we don't fight that much, the relationship gets boring.
Wait a second.
Between you and Michael,
who's the sadist and who's the masochist?
Let's just look for another restaurant.
We can't find a parking spot.
We'll find one. Don't give up so easily!
Let's check here.
-Look, I think that car is leaving. -Finally.
See? I told you so.
We wouldn't find this spot if we gave up and left.
Can you believe these idiots?
-Betsy, don't! -But that's our spot!
-Stop it! -They have no right to take it!
Betsy, stop!
Where are you going?
Betsy!
Hey, this is our spot. Move it!
-Betsy, please calm down. -Let me go!
-We were here first! -Enough…
-Why don't you fight back? -Betsy…
-How dare you! -Betsy…
You can't just steal this spot!
-What's your problem? -No, we're sorry.
You are the problem! You stole our parking space!
-Hey, we were here first! -No way! We got here first!
-Move your car somewhere else! -But we were here first!
Shit!
Bro… Maybe we can--
Michael!
You and Michael are close, aren't you?
Why don't you talk to him?
But Auntie…
I think that girl is a bad influence on him.
Auntie, Michael is way past the age of puberty.
I'm sure he knows what he's doing.
Are you sure?
To get beaten up just because of that brat?
You know your cousin is a bit naive when it comes to girls.
Betsy is not a bad person.
Was she the one who punched me?
And you know what?
What you're doing is the opposite of being a Christian.
You're judging a person without knowing her.
That's against the Bible!
Let's go.
God bless you, Auntie.
You too, Uncle.
Dude, can you tell me what really happened?
How did you end up in a fight?
I'm not in the mood to tell you.
Mikey, dude, I just want to ask…
-Are you really serious with that girl? -Of course, I am.
Come on! You don't sound so sure!
When I first saw this, I told myself, it's about time.
About time for what?
For you to wear trendy clothes!
You look a lot older than your age because of the clothes you wear.
Look, it suits you well!
It looks good on you!
Look!
Not your type?
You don't like it?
-No, it's just that-- -But you still don't like it.
-Maybe I'll wear it-- -Give it back.
What's wrong?
You don't like it!
-I want-- -You want to return it!
I like it, okay?
All I'm asking for is a little appreciation!
-He's conservative. -You mean he's not fashionable?
Aside from that, he's too stingy!
We've only been to one restaurant since we started dating!
The one that's cheap but has big servings!
The eat-all-you-can style!
Okay, so Mr. Intelligent and Elegant…
turned out to be outdated and cheap?
Now, you're having doubts…
because he's not the man of your fantasies?
Sis, remember this.
They are never the people you think they are.
Are you okay?
I'm exhausted.
I took a lot of calls…
and my jaw hurts from speaking with an accent.
So, where do you want to go?
It's up to you.
You wanted to hang out, so you decide.
-Let's just watch a movie. -A movie?
Why not?
There's nothing good to watch.
Then let's just go to the mall.
Again? Can we go somewhere else?
-What do you think? -Let's just eat outside.
I'm still full. My officemate brought food for his birthday.
I had two plates of spaghetti.
So, where should we go?
You rejected my suggestions and now you're asking me again?
Hang on, why are you mad?
I'm not mad.
Just tell me where we're going.
Nobody said that a relationship between two people…
would only be filled with happy days.
Because no two people are alike.
And because of their differences,
their love may begin to bloom…
while misunderstandings start to grow.
That's how relationships are.
Similar, opposites, yet still together.
Nobody is perfect.
These imperfections give depth to a relationship.
But it could also be the reason feelings end.
Mike, how was the meeting?
You think our boss is in a bad mood?
No, she seems to be in a good mood.
She even told a lame joke.
But we all laughed anyway.
She could use some encouragement.
Dude, check this out.
What's that?
-Excuse me, miss. -Yes, ma'am?
I'm looking for the Finance department…
-Just go straight ahead. -Where?
-Okay, miss. Thank you. -Who's that?
Her?
She's new here.
It's her first day in Finance.
Her name is Joey.
Excuse me.
What time is it?
Long story.
You were supposed to be here by 5:30.
It's 7:00.
I've been texting and calling, but you never responded.
My phone died.
I wasn't able to charge it last night.
How come?
I just forgot.
Where's our cab?
That's the other reason I'm late.
I had a hard time getting a cab, so I just walked.
So, how are we going to have dinner?
You use your hands to eat, not a cab.
You even have the nerve to act smart with me?
Excuse me?
-Yes? -Are you busy?
-Not really. -Well, I have a problem.
Should I just call Maintenance?
No, I got this.
-Are you sure you can open it? -Yes, it's just a bit tight.
See?
Okay, I got it.
Open sesame!
-Wow! Thank you. -No problem.
Thanks a lot.
Here, just call Ben, so he can check on your lock.
Okay.
I'll go ahead.
My goodness! A cockroach! Kill it! Please! Hurry!
-Cockroach! -Okay, wait. Hold on.
I got it.
Hurry up and kill it!
Die!
It's dead! Look, it's not moving!
Yuck!
Why did you use my bag to kill it?
I thought it's a folder.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Hey.
Here you go. It's all clean.
-No trace of cockroach at all. -I see.
And it smells good, too.
‎Good as new. Thank you. How kind of you.
I didn't know you're sweet. Oh, by the way.
Here's your cell phone. You left it at my desk.
No worries. And…
Thank you, too.
You know, I can handle anything except cockroaches and snakes!
-Otherwise, I go crazy. -Of course.
Thank you.
WHERE ARE YOU?
I've noticed that he has changed.
How so?
He keeps to himself most of the time.
-And-- -Why wouldn't he be? You talk too much!
Close your eyes!
No, I feel like he doesn't appreciate--
Stop it, Betchay. I've heard enough of that.
Come with me. It's about time I get frank with you.
Hey!
Okay, we're best friends, right?
Friends, best friends…
‎-More than best friends. ‎-Right? Hey, watch it!
Okay, if we're more than best friends,
I'm sure I can tell you anything, right?
And I'm just telling you this because…
I want to be honest with you, and…
I just want the best for you and this accountant…
What?
Come on, the suspense is killing me. Just spill it already!
Are you sure you can take it?
Okay.
Elizabeth.
Any guy who receives your countless text messages
with quotations from the Bible, every hour of the day…
-would definitely go nuts! -What's wrong with that?
You really don't know?
Betchay, you monitor your boyfriend
as if he's an ICU patient in critical condition!
That's just wrong!
Now, you're wondering why he's always pissed and irritated?
You should be thankful he hasn't left you!
-My God! -You don't understand.
I just want to share my life.
-Oh, please! -Ouch!
That's what you get…
from watching all those romantic movies!
Stop sharing your life as if it's some kind of charity!
You're so corny!
And will you stop acting like a kid?
Please!
Really, Stefi?
-You think so? -Of course!
You're his girlfriend, partner, and lover.
You're not his… A: Bodyguard
B: Nurse…
C: Nanny…
and most of all…
D: His mother!
Girl, he already has a mom!
And have you ever heard of the words,
A: Annoying…
B: Sickening…
C: Suffocating…
That's you!
You're not just letters A, B, and C. You're also letter D!
-You know what that is? -What?
D: All of the above!
And Betchay,
there's no such thing as a fairy godmother.
Keep that in mind.
There's no fairy godmother who will grant your wish.
That's not how life works!
You're a human being who's capable of love.
And you have to remember that your boyfriend is only human, too.
Okay?
You're so unfair, Estefania!
Why didn't you tell me that sooner? I thought we're friends.
I am your friend! That's why I'm saying this--
Ouch! You stepped on my foot!
Hey! Where are you going?
Get back here! I'm not done with your makeup!
Okay, thank you.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Michael Morelos.
Oh, Michael?
He just stepped out about 15 minutes ago.
Is that so?
Is there someone who knows where he went?
Wait.
Mr. Perez!
Chito! Come here!
Yes?
You can ask him. They work together in Accounting.
Okay.
Hi, I'm Betsy. I'm a friend of Michael.
I know. I saw your picture on his computer monitor.
You're his wallpaper.
Hey.
She told me he went out.
Would you know if he has a business meeting or--
Well, he was asking me out for lunch a while ago.
He wanted to eat at his favorite Spanish restaurant…
but he suddenly disappeared.
Where exactly is this restaurant?
Are you sure she won't get mad
if she finds out we're together?
Who are you referring to?
I know you have a girlfriend.
And who told you that gossip?
Michael, you can't hide things like that.
Besides, it's okay.
It's okay?
We're not doing anything wrong, are we?
We're just having lunch.
Why should she get mad?
And besides, you're not yet married.
And even if you are,
it doesn't mean that you can't be friends with people of the opposite sex.
Wow.
Why?
It just makes sense!
I hope, one time…
you could talk to her.
I mean…
So you can tell her what you just told me.
Excuse me, sir?
Would you like me to place your orders now, sir?
By the way, ma'am,
would you like me to raise the shades for you?
Yes, please. It's not that hot anyway.
-Okay. -Thank you.
Why?
-What are you doing? -Eyelash!
They say that if you catch an eyelash,
you can make a wish.
Then make a wish.
So, what did you wish for?
You're funny.
Hi!
Betsy…
You're the girl on his computer monitor, right?
Hi, I'm Joey.
Hi!
Michael and I work together and…
we were just talking about you.
Really?
That's right.
He told me a lot about you and--
So, what were you telling her about me?
What did you tell her?
What? Tell me!
Betsy, wait.
Betsy…
Betsy!
Betsy!
-Betsy-- -Before you think of anything…
I want you to know I didn't follow you at the restaurant.
I went to your office because I wanted to talk to you personally.
But you weren't there.
Why don't you speak up?
Nothing.
Michael, it can't always be like this.
Nothing?
It's 11:30 and you went out of your way to get here.
I'm sure you have something to tell me.
Betsy…
I don't want to know who that girl is.
Maybe I just want to clarify something.
Do you like her?
Let me rephrase that.
Do you like me?
Betsy.
I came here because…
Maybe…
it would be better…
if we give…
each other some time.
Time for what?
Time…
Time to think?
-You understand-- -Yes.
I completely understand.
-Here she comes. -Let's go.
-That's the right mindset! -They should do some research first…
-Why? -Hey.
Dad, I'm going to bed.
-Okay. -Good night, Khalil.
Good night.
Hey!
Do you really want to get our friend drunk?
Oh, please!
She can handle that!
She drinks like a sailor!
Go, girl, drink some more.
Betchay, that's enough.
It's your fault. You took it too seriously.
What did you expect?
You know, boys will always be boys,
no matter how decent they may look.
Hey! That's enough!
You're just making her more depressed.
I'm just telling her the truth!
Betch, that's enough.
-Betch, drink some more. -Betch, that's enough.
-No, Betch, drink up. -Betch, that's enough.
Leave her be!
It was so difficult!
Hey, Michael, is my shirt here?
Hey, this looks good!
It looks new! Let me borrow this.
-Let me use it. -Not this shirt!
Okay. Never mind, then.
It's all yours!
So, what really happened? Even Stefi is acting weird!
This is between you and your girl.
Leave me out of it!
It's nothing.
Nothing?
Betsy is close to having a nervous breakdown!
You're stupid!
You tried to be sneaky, but you were so careless!
You know, dude?
Every man should know the art of sneaking around!
I'll teach you.
-It's nothing like that. -Then what?
I don't know.
Things happened so fast.
I'm not even sure if I really courted her
or if it was the other way around.
So, who's that girl you got caught with?
Are you also courting her?
Dude, you have to make up your mind!
It's either you're serious or you're just playing around.
If you're just playing around, make sure the girl isn't serious.
Because if she is serious, it will only end up badly!
Get it, dude?
You can have it.
Hello?
Hello, Betchay?
Is there a problem?
Nothing.
Bye.
Are you busy?
No.
-I'm fine. Why? -No, you're not fine.
I've noticed for a few days that…
something is wrong with you.
Is it your girl?
Michael, it is not the end of the world.
You know, there are--
-But-- -Enough with the sad stories.
I easily get depressed.
I feel bad whenever my friends are sad.
That's why…
I'll try to make you happy.
I want to remove the sour look on your face.
Why are you doing this?
Because I want to.
What's wrong with that?
Why are you not drinking?
I already told you, I don't drink much.
But you're okay?
Then stop looking at your watch!
I feel like I'm dating Cinderella.
Oh, my God! It's my friend, Celine!
I didn't know she got back from the States. Let's join them!
No, thank you…
It's too crowded over there. A lot of smokers, too.
Michael, we've been sitting here for hours!
It can't be just the two of us the whole night.
What's wrong with that?
Michael, there are other people in this world, you know?
Go ahead and join your friends if you like.
What about you?
I'll stay here.
Are you sure?
Okay, I'll be there for a while. Bye!
-Celine! Hi! -Hey!
-Hello! -Hello!
-Hello! -Hello! -Hi. -How are you?
-Hi! -Who's your date?
He's just an officemate.
These days, it's hard to find a woman
who takes relationships seriously.
They change partners as if they're just changing clothes.
You don't want another drink, sir?
I was shocked!
You really had to tell that to Mom?
Can you imagine if he was wearing a dress?
Come on, I just really liked that toy.
It's not like--
-Go ahead and show it to her! -No way!
Dad?
Betsy?
You're home.
Your father reached out to me.
He said you needed your mother.
I knew this time would come.
Forgive me, Betsy.
Don't cry.
My little girl is all grown up.
Beer?
I could use one.
I noticed.
Looks like you had a good night.
I'm not even drunk.
Is something wrong?
Are you and Mommy having problems again?
That's part of my daily life.
Dad?
Have you ever thought of leaving your wife?
I've thought about it a number of times.
Different reasons.
Different scenarios.
And?
Two things.
It's either I'm too proud…
or I'm a coward.
What do you mean?
I'm arrogant in the sense…
that your mom picked me over her other suitors,
I don't think I can accept that we didn't make it work.
On the other hand, I'm a coward
because I thought that if we do get separated…
and I don't handle it well,
I might just realize that I'm better off with her.
You're not making sense, Dad.
I've been that way for 24 years now!
And for 24 years,
I've been asking myself why I love your mother so much!
To think we're so different from each other.
She's controlling, always nagging, and jealous!
She gets pissed if you don't pick up her calls.
Forget about her birthday, expect a war!
Even if she knows you're tired,
she still expects you to tell her about your day!
Even if it's a lame story,
she expects you to listen because if you don't--
-She won't stop nagging you! -She will ignore you for a week!
After that, she starts sulking.
Because…
-she thinks she's taken for granted-- -Exactly!
But if she's not around,
you don't seem contented.
Like something is missing.
-You'll miss the noise. -It's suddenly all quiet!
-You're uneasy! -You want to hit somebody!
-Because you badly miss her! -So much!
Then what's the problem?
Do you love her?
What if she leaves me just like Katherine did?
Is her name Katherine?
It's Betsy.
Even if her name is Katherine, they're still different.
I don't know, Dad. Maybe…
I don't want to end up like you and Mommy.
Then don't!
How can I be sure?
You can't be sure.
I can't guarantee that you won't get hurt again.
I can't guarantee that you won't have problems.
But I also can't guarantee that you won't be happy!
Because that's how love goes!
Not knowing…
is the sweetest mystery in loving another person.
And how much you can love…
is the greatest discovery…
you can have of yourself.
Is Dad still your ideal man?
He still is.
You know, the concept of an ideal man
has a different meaning when you're young and in love.
You may think the person you love is perfect…
and you expect him to stay that way.
But as you grow older,
you'll start to see the real him.
That he's not perfect just like you.
Just like everybody else.
But, Mom?
Does that mean…
you made a mistake in choosing him?
Doesn't it frustrate you? Do you stop caring?
You feel hopeless!
You get what I mean?
Do you stop loving?
Of course not.
It only means that if you truly love him,
you'll learn to accept his imperfections.
And he should do the same.
And the most important thing…
what you both have to accept about each other…
is the fact that you're never alike
and are continuously changing.
It seems difficult.
That's because you're in love!
Excuse me.
Betsy?
-Excuse me. -Betsy!
Betsy!
-Hang on. -You're cutting in line!
-I… -Watch it.
I just want to tell you something.
What?
You're annoying.
You meddle too much.
You talk too much.
You're hot-headed.
-Sometimes… -He said she meddles too much.
you're pissing me off.
Betsy!
Betsy!
Let me through!
Betsy! Wait!
Betsy!
Betsy!
-Hey! -Mister!
I'm sorry, but I need your motorcycle.
I'm so sorry.
-I'll pay you later! -Okay, hop on.
You may sit here, ma'am.
Thank you.
Are you okay, ma'am?
I hate him.
He didn't have the guts to tell me in person.
He broke up with me through a letter!
"I realized that I don't love you anymore."
Don't cry.
At least, he told you what he truly feels.
He was honest…
and he didn't give you false hopes.
If that's true,
then why can't he say it to my face?
That's what hurts me the most.
Have you ever been in love?
Who knows? This may be a blessing in disguise.
Maybe…
there's someone who's more deserving to have you.
Oh, no! I missed my stop!
This letter is too long.
I'm sorry, but I really have to go.
Good luck with your love life.
Good luck with yours, too.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Thanks again.
Hey! Wait! Your flowers!
Thank you!
Stop right there!
Excuse me.
Betsy?
Betsy!
Betsy!
-Stop right there! -Betsy! Let go of me!
-Don't jump in there! -Betsy! Hey!
-Betsy! Wait! -That's dangerous, sir!
I want to tell you something!
Get lost! I don't want to hear it!
This is important! Please listen to me!
Betsy, please!
You're stubborn!
Meddlesome!
Talkative!
Hot-headed!
-Sometimes, you annoy me! -You really want to get hurt?
Hold on, let me finish!
This is important! Wait. Please!
Get off me!
And because that's who you are,
I realized something.
Betsy, I love you so much!
And whatever happens,
I don't want you to change!
Say something.
I'm starting to look like a fool here.
What did you say?
You heard it already. Don't make me say it again.
I love you so much!
Betsy!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Betsy!
I love you so much, Betsy.
I really do.
And that's what everyone hopes for.
To find that person
they're destined to be with for the rest of their lives.

No, it's better than that. It's actually something you can use in college.
Come on.
I love it. Thanks, you guys.
Just don't spend all your time on it, okay? I know that you have a scholarship to keep up with,

Well, I was raised by construction workers.
What have you got? Peanut butter. It's so good.
Yeah!
[Sydney] I was only nine when my mom died.
Which means my formative years were left up to my dad.
Being a plumber did give him a certain unique perspective.

Wow.
You know, if your mom was here, She'd know exactly what to say.
She'd be so excited you're going to her school, gonna join her sorority.

Oh, that's okay. People sometimes don't see me. I'm Dinky. Oh, no, you're not.
No, silly, that's my name. Oh, Dinky? That's your real name?
Of course not. My real name's Demetria Rosemead.
Dinky it is. Hi, I'm Sydney White.

Daughter of Paul White and Deborah lee, Kappa pledge class 1980?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I feel bad I didn't order your background check.
I'm the other Kappa legacy! Oh, my gosh! This is just so exciting!
Oh, my gosh! This is just so exciting! I should've known they would've roomed us together for rush.
Don't get too comfortable. We're gonna move to the Kappa house!
We're gonna be sisters!
Yay. We're jumping now.
I've just been waiting to become a Kappa since I can remember. All the women in my family were Kappas too.
See, look. My momma gave me her when I was five.
She even has a little pledge pin. She sure does.
Does she come with a mini Kappa dream house? Oh... Oh, I wish.
Now, what were you thinking about Wearing to the first rush party? Let me... Let me just show you what I was thinking.
Let me... Let me just show you what I was thinking. Okay.
Now, those... Those are my top five.
Wow. I don't even have a top one.
You know, I might have a skirt... Oh, no. In here somewhere.
Did you have a luggage mishap?
No.
Well, what about in that bag? Oh. Oh, this bag.
Oh, wait until you see this!
My comic-book collection.
Oh, my... Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah, you know what? Why don't you just wear something of mine to the first rush party?
Oh, okay. Yeah. That might be best.
You know, this is gonna be fun.
Never really had a lot of girlfriends before.
Not just girlfriends.
Sisters.
I'd like to welcome Tyler Prince, President of Beta Omega Rho fraternity.
Hey, everyone.
I've asked Tyler to come today to talk about a very special project.
So, the plan is...
We have a golden opportunity right on Greek row.
[girl] The vortex? Where all those freaks live? That's the golden opportunity?
No.
This is.
The Witchburn-Prince Greek life center will soon break ground.
Tyler's parents and my parents have already donated the funds.
We just need to deal with the current tenants.
I've been assured by the administration
that this is a priority for the university for this year.
Okay, so text me.
This is silly. When are you gonna stop all this and come back to me?
This is silly. When are you gonna stop all this and come back to me? You dumped me, remember?
It was middle school, what did I know? I thought I was gonna marry a Backstreet boy.
You still could.
I got to go pick up the keg.
Yeah, well, I got to go too.
I wish we had the same size feet. Oh, it's okay.
Oh, it's okay. I mean, isn't the whole point of this whole sisterhood thing that they like you for who you are?
Um... Sure.

But we're actually gonna be late to our first rush party, so if you'll excuse us...
Oh, maybe he could help us find our way. We're going to Kappa. Mmm-hmm.
All right, ladies. Let me be your Greek guide.
Each house has a reputation.
There's the Gamma Phi's.
They're perky.
Very perky. Lots of cheerleaders.
And here's Pi Beta Omega. Those girls can out-party any fraternity on campus.
So what was the first house? The one with the junior tiger guide?
That would be the Vortex. That's a weird name for a fraternity.
It's not a fraternity. It started off as overflow student housing.
Now it's just kind of there.
Here's our stop. Kappa Phi Nu.
Well, thank you for the tour, Tyler. Yeah, thank...
Sydney, you know what? I'm gonna meet you inside. Why?
The Illegally Blondes. You? Really?
Yeah. Is it the shoes? [laughs] No. I love the shoes.
The Kappas are just a little intense.
Oh, well, it was actually my mother's house. Ah. Legacy. Is she all over you about rushing?
No. She died nine years ago.
-I'm sorry. -Oh, it's okay.
Kappas could use a girl like you.
I should know. They're our sister sorority.
Oh! So we'll be like brother and sister!
Not in, you know, the related, familial way, but, you know, more in the fraternal, sororal...
Sororital? Is that a word? Sorry.
Sororital? Is that a word? Sorry. I kind of tend to over talk when I'm nervous. It's a disease, one without a cure. So stop me any time, please.
It's a disease, one without a cure. So stop me any time, please. You're nervous?
Oh, no. No, it's not you. Tyler, was it? No, it's because of the whole rush, you know?
The very term "rush" is an amper-upper. It amps up the old nerves.
I have to go.
Okay, ladies. Listen up.
The doors are about to open. Our objective is?
[all] Target cute pledges.
Exactly. And what do we want to avoid?
Fat losers.
Now, now. We all remember the code.
When I ask you to show a girl to the "koi pond," ditch her.
We also have two legacies coming today, Dinky Hodgekiss and Sydney White.
When you meet them, find me immediately.
Okay, girls. Are we ready?
[all reciting] Here comes a Kappa, queen of the row.
She's hot, she's cool, she ain't no ho.
She's got style, she's got class, And from behind a kicking
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!
Excuse me, Amy. Don't you remember? You've been reassigned. Kitchen duty.
You've been reassigned. Kitchen duty.
Go on.
That's what happens when you gain 27 pounds of breakup weight over the summer.
[all] Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Hi!
Hey!
Everyone wants to be a Kappa. We've been dating for two years. I love him so much! And next week, he's gonna pin me.
And next week, he's gonna pin me.
Pin you to what?
-Hi. -Hi.
[girl] Hi there. Oh, hi.
I'm Katy and this is Christy.
I'm Sydney White.
You're one of our legacies. Rachel's gonna be so excited!
Rachel, we'd like you to meet someone.
Oh, hi.
Girls, why don't you show this one the koi pond? I love koi ponds.
Great. Off you go.
This is Sydney White.
Three words. Leg-a-cy?
Sydney, so pleased to meet you.
I'm so excited. My mom had a great experience here.
Katy, have you offered our guest a drink from the refreshment table?
I'm actually not that thirsty... No, no. Katy.
No, no. Katy. The refreshment table?
We have a situation. That girl is not Kappa material.
[Christy] Really? I didn't see anything wrong with her.
Christy, you know you're not as perceptive as I am.
That girl wouldn't know her Gucci from her pucci.
Not to mention, I saw her throwing herself All over Tyler before she came in the house.
It was embarrassing. Trust me, we do not want a Kappa who behaves that way.
See what I mean?
[Christy] But we have to give her a bid. She's a legacy.
Her mom gets her the bid, but she has to survive pledging all on her own.
[girl] Oh, my gosh. I saw him outside, and he is definitely the hottest guy on campus.
Who's the hottest guy on campus?
Tyler Prince, the Beta president. Oh, you know, I know that guy. He was really nice.
Oh, you know, I know that guy. He was really nice. He showed me around Greek row.
Off limits. He's Rachel's boyfriend.
Oh... Yeah, they're off right now, but they'll be on again any minute. It's all part of Rachel's 20 year plan.
He'll be a top litigator, she'll be a senator. It's so romantic.
Yeah, it does sound romantic.
Because there is nothing more romantic than a 20 year plan. Am I right, ladies?
So, Sydney, where does your dad work?
Oh, he works mostly on construction sites.
Oh. My uncle's made a mint building malls. So, your dad's a developer, too?
Yeah. Something like that.
[Rachel] Night, girls. Get your beauty rest. Now that you're Kappa pledges, it's a requirement.
♪ Lay you down, Dear sweet pledge ♪
♪ Lay your head on the pillow ♪
♪ May you have lovely dreams ♪

Has anyone found the koi pond?
It's 12:01! Welcome to hell, skanks!
Over the next week, we'll be conducting What I like to call "pledge enlightenment."
What I like to call "pledge enlightenment." We're not allowed to call it "hazing,"
Not after what happened to Suzie.
We're gonna find out which of you Prada princesses
has what it takes to be a Kappa,
And which of you don't.
This is your first pledge task, the date dash.
You have until 12:15 to find a date and meet me at the State street diner.
No changing clothes, no makeup, no brushing your hair or teeth!
You have 15 minutes! Let's go! [Kappas] Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
[girl] Come on!
Dinky! Dinky! What do we do? Oh, you just grab a guy.
Excuse me, sugar. Can I borrow you for a date dash?
-Hurry up, girl. Come on. -Okay. Come on!
Hello? Hello?
Hello? Hello? [boy] Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hi. I'm sorry I startled you. Can you... Can you help me?
Okay.
-Thanks. -Sure.
Oh, sorry. Sorry, thanks. What are you doing in a bush?
I don't know what happened. I was walking home And this crazed pack of girls came running toward me.
So I dove for cover.
Yeah, vision not impaired. Sense of balance restored.
Feeling in fingers and toes. No visible-- Wait! You're a guy, right?
Yeah.
What are you doing right now? I'm waiting for an antihistamine to take effect.
I need you to be my date.
Your date?
Yeah. Let's go.
Oh, you might wanna watch out. When I get this excited, I tend to throw up. It's okay, just keep moving, and tell me when to duck. Okay.
[Sydney] Let's go!
What's good? Wonderful. You just made it.
Wonderful. You just made it.
[Sydney] How's the BLT?
Oh, my god. Look at her with that pie. It's a so-rority, not a ho-rority.
So, tell me about the Vortex. What's it like?
I guess you'd call it a haven, for people who don't have anywhere else to go.
Some of us didn't get along with our roommates, some of us made others feel uncomfortable.
some of us made others feel uncomfortable.
Some of us wet the bed.
Some of us wet the hallway.
All of us are outsiders.
Yeah, I know what that's like.
Are you serious? You're a Kappa pledge, by definition, very much an insider.
Would all the Kappa pledges join me over here for a moment?
-Guess I'll be right back. -Yes.
Okay, girls. It's time for your next pledge task.
The date dash ditch.
This year's unsuitable date belongs to...
Sydney.
Sorry, you're gonna have to ditch him.
But my guy's really nice. And I dragged him all the way down here.
And he has a sinus infection And his athlete's foot is flaring up. And he has glaucoma, he thinks.
And he has glaucoma, he thinks. I cannot just ditch him. I don't make the rules, Sydney.
If being a Kappa is important to you, Then this is the price you pay.
Hey, date.
Hey. I ordered you another cup of coffee.
I need you to meet me in the girl's bathroom. -Another pledge ritual. -Oh.
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Okay. I'll meet you there.
Sydney?
Pervert!
Looks like you get stuck with the check.
[Carlton] We live in a country that's considered to be the ultimate model of government.
By the people, for the people, and of the people.
But most Americans would be surprised to find how afraid the founding fathers were
find how afraid the founding fathers were of what a direct democracy could do to the country.
Can anyone tell me why?
The young man snoring there, perhaps?
The founding fathers were afraid that direct democracy
would do to America what it did to Rome.
Alexander Hamilton even advocated a monarchy.
Exactly.
We are trained to think the more power the people have, the better.
Can any of you tell me some reasons why this isn't necessarily true?
Terrence. Still here after eight years.
What do you say we give someone else a chance to respond this time?
Ms. Witchburn?
Most Americans don't educate themselves about the issues.
There are some valid arguments for keeping things a little bit more elite.
You could even argue a case for certain types of oligarchy.
Interesting.
Let's hear from someone else. How about you?
Ms? White.
Ms. White.
Any thoughts?
I guess I think that's...
underestimating the masses a bit.
Not to mention overestimating the elites.
Apartheid was an oligarchy, and no one wants that again.
Excellent.
Alicia, what year was Kappa Phi Nu founded? -1902! -Very good.
-1902! -Very good.
Want some breakfast?
Yeah.
Help yourself.
Breakfast is good.
It's called moisturizer. Try some. Next.
Ugh! Your pores are enormous.
They have this new thing called whitening toothpaste. Next.
Dinky. Kappa founder Kitty Cooper's hometown?
Little Rock.
Lose the big hair. This isn't Dallas.
Bye.
Eyebrows, meet tweezers. Tweezers, meet your worst nightmare.
-I know. -[Rachel] Next. Next. Next.
Okay, future sisters. Get your lazy asses up. You're gonna clean the bathrooms.
Get your lazy asses up. You're gonna clean the bathrooms.
At the Beta fraternity house.
Sydney, the Kappa Phi Nu colors? Green and white.
Wrong. Emerald and pearl.
Sorry. I'm still learning how to speak priss.
You know what? Don't change a thing.
You just keep walking around looking just like that.
-You again. -Oh.
-Morning. -hi.
Sorry you had to do that.
Looks like some of the girls are a little traumatized. Yeah. It's okay. I spend a lot of time in bathrooms.
Yeah. It's okay. I spend a lot of time in bathrooms.
No, no. I don't mean like that, I just mean that... I don't go to the bathroom a lot, I...
You know, sometimes I do. Kind of depends on what I eat.
Just to be clear, I spend a normal amount of time in the bathroom.
Sydney. It's time to get back to the house. Okay.
Don't ask. We had to take her.
I think she's cool. And cute.
[Spanky] Just admit they're cooler.
[Spanky] Just admit they're cooler. You don't know what the hell you're talking about.
There is no way that a pirate is cooler than a ninja.
Ninjas live like monks. Pirates get booty. End of discussion.
Hi. I need to return these and I have a couple of Poli Sci books on reserve.
I'm impressed. I don't get a lot of pledges in here studying.
Well, they probably don't have scholarships to maintain.
[Gurkin] You and your drunken, whoring pirates
represent the lowest common denominator in society!
All right. I think we can all agree that a pirate-ninja
would be the coolest thing ever.
[Sydney] Hi.
Oh, hi.
Hello.
I wanted to apologize for what I did to you in the bathroom.
What did she do to you in the bathroom? What did she do?
It was a stupid pledge prank and I'm really, really sorry.
Hey, it wasn't exactly surprising behavior for a Kappa.
Come on, let's go. Excuse me.
If it makes you feel any better, they threw bologna at us
while we sang Celine Dion songs!
Girls, it's been a long journey, but you're almost done.
Tomorrow night is our presents dance
where you will be introduced as official Kappa sisters.
It's tradition for the current sisters
to pass down their presents gowns to the new pledges.
After all, we're all size two.
Except you, Amy.
As president, I will draw the first name.
This lucky girl is getting one of Milan's finest.
Sydney White.
Come, Sydney.
Hey, Christy, why don't you check your standing?
I'm sure you've cracked the top 20 by now.
What's that?
Just the school's "hot or not" ranking on MySpace.
It's just some dumb list.
That does sound dumb.
Really dumb. I bet lame people just log on all day and vote for themselves.
No, we don't. We're only allowed to vote once a day.
Right, Rachel?
Hey, Rach, you're still number one.
Am I? How cute.
It's been that way for forever. You know how people are,
It's been that way for forever. You know how people are, they just stick with the status quo.
That's why new people never make it on. Oh, my god. Sydney's on it, number 213.
Oh, my god. Sydney's on it, number 213. I am?
Let me see that.
But I thought you said new people never make it on the list.
Well, like you said, it's just some dumb list.
But aren't we just so lucky to have you as a pledge?
And I think you're gonna look just gorgeous in...
Perfect. Totally you. Practically screams number 213.
Hey, Tyler.
Oh, you're so bad!
I have to take this.
[Rachel] J enny Robinson.
Dinky Hodgekiss.
Alicia Fairchild.
Bunchie Hathaway.
And finally, Sydney White.
I present to you this fall's Kappa Phi Nu pledge class.
You look incredible.
Thank you.
Dance?
Who are you, Sydney White?
You throw a football like Matt Leinart, fearlessly conquer fraternity bathrooms,
and clean up nice to boot.
Well, I'm more of a Peyton Manning. Leinart's a lefty.
Marry me.
So, they go all out for these shindigs, huh?
It's a weird word, "shindig." You eat? Because there are some hors d'oeuvres over there.
You know, I tried to eat a plastic flower once. Kind of hurt.
I'm rambling again, aren't I?
I'm starting to think I make you nervous.
No.
Congratulations. You are now a Kappa sister.
Congratulations. You are now a Kappa sister.
Congratulations. You are now a Kappa sister.
Congratulations. You are now a Kappa sister.
Congratulations. You are now a Kappa sister. You are now a Kappa sister. You are now a Kappa sister.
You are now a Kappa sister. You are now a Kappa sister. Kappa sister... Sister... Sister...
Congratulations. You are now a Kappa sister.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid we have a bit of a situation.
Every so often, it is the unfortunate duty of president to act as judge and jury.
Sydney White has exhibited inappropriate Kappa behavior.
Is this a pledge prank? It certainly is not.
You are guilty of the following infractions.
You brought an unsuitable date to the date dash,
cheated during a pledge quiz,
revealed a secret pledge ritual to the entire library,
and, finally, lied about your background.
We all know your dad is actually a plumber.
As Kappa president, according to Statute 25a of the sorority charter,
I hereby dismiss Sydney White from the Kappa pledge class.
I don't know what your mother got away with when she was here,
but you will never be a Kappa.
You know what? Thank you.
Because if this is what sisterhood's all about, then I don't want any part of it.
I want that dress back.
Take it!
I will see your cobra commander, and I will raise you a mint, unopened,
and I will raise you a mint, unopened, power of the force, return of the Jedi, Luke Skywalker in...
power of the force, return of the Jedi, Luke Skywalker in...
Battle poncho.
We fold.
Which is better? Three a's or two of the cards with the ladies on them?
-You dope. -What?
If you have both, it's a full house.
How is it you always win at cards,
but you can't make it from junior tiger guide to tiger guide?
It's one badge, okay? It's one badge.
Knots are hard.
Knots are hard. Does anyone know another word for "douchebaggery"?
I don't want to repeat it a third time. Gurkin, no one reads your whiny blog anyway.
Peoplespunisher.com is not about being read.
It's about being written.
Good morning, Embele.
Where do you think he goes?
Outside, a lady waits. She wears jean pants and looks very sad.
There's a girl outside? Yes!
There's a girl outside? Yes! Am I looking good? Yes.
Am I looking good? Yes.
It's the bathroom babe!
I'm going to go work the spanky magic.
Sorry. You probably don't want me sitting out here.
And I understand, especially you.
And you were right about the whole Kappa thing.
I'll go.
Did they really make you sing Celine Dion?
Yeah.
Do you need a place to stay?
[Lenny] Guys, this is Sydney.
She needs a place to stay. She gave up her dorm room to pledge Kappa.
Sydney, these are the guys. Gurkin.
Terrence.
George.
Jeremy.
Don't forget me. Oh, of course. Skoozer.
[whispers] Jeremy's shy. He had several therapists as a kid.
One of them recommended a puppet. He never stopped using it.
One of them recommended a puppet. He never stopped using it. You'll get used to skoozer.
Yeah, it's okay. As long as he doesn't try to hump my bunny slippers.
No promises.
That's Embelackpo Akimbatunde. We just call him Embele.
He's from Nigeria and hasn't adjusted to the time change.
His days and nights are actually reversed. Jet lag, huh? When did he get here?
Three years ago.
Thank you.
Of course! I have to invert the ratio.
Come on, Bilbo.
And what exactly is he doing? We have no idea.
Okay.
Welcome to the Vortex.
[Lenny] Sydney? Oh, hi. Come in.
Hi.
I'm sorry. I know it can be a little spooky up here at night, so I brought you this.
up here at night, so I brought you this.
That night light has gotten me through some pretty tough times.
Thanks, that's really sweet.
Hey, is that Dark Fury, No. 4?
Yeah. The one with the... [both] First appearance of the emerald mask.
You know, you may be more Vortex than Kappa after all.
So, are you all set? Do you need anything?
A hypoallergenic pillow? Humidifier? Dehumidifier? Ionizer?
Nope. I think I'm all good on the medical-supply front.
Are you sure? There's a lot of dust.
I've actually got loads of allergy medicine.
You? Allergies? I never would've guessed.
Yeah, I know, just the usual, dairy, wheat, peanuts, -bee stings, cats, -Wow, that's a lot of--
-bee stings, cats, -Wow, that's a lot of-- shellfish, pollen, wood.
A few others. But it's getting late. You're probably tired.
Well, yeah. Public humiliation can be pretty tiring.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, I don't know if you need any sort of special...
lady products. No, no. I'm good. Thanks, though.
Thanks for everything, Lenny.
Hey. I don't know if you need me to do anything...
I don't know if you need me to do anything... Spanky, go.
Sorry about that. Let me know if he bothers you.
Sorry about that. Let me know if he bothers you. Spanky's kind of... Well, he really likes girls but he doesn't know many.
Spanky's kind of... Well, he really likes girls but he doesn't know many.
But he keeps himself happy.
You may find this hard to believe,
but most of the guys here don't have a lot of experience with girls.
Dudes. That thing has touched boobs.
Of course.
The sturdy, breathable fabric is designed to maintain mammary elasticity.
Shut up, Terrence! You're ruining the moment for me.
[Paul] Hello.
Hey, dad. Did I wake you? What? Are you kidding?
How was the big dance?
That's actually why I was calling.
Well, come on. I've been waiting up to hear. Tell me all about it.
It was great.
Yeah, it's all very exciting.
Sydney, I'm sure that your mom is right there taking it all in with you.
I know.
That's what I keep thinking.
Good night, sweetie. Night, dad.
This place is a deathtrap. How about some repairs?
Sydney, don't start. You know why we can't get any damn repairs?
I'll tell you why. Campus-wide systematic Greek oppression.
Read peoplespunisher.com if you want to know more. I did a whole series on it.
I don't know what this house needing repairs has to do with the Greek system anyway. It isn't even Greek.
Precisely! That's the problem. Rachel Witchburn and the Greeks run the student council.
The student council dictates all budget appropriations.
Over the past 14 semesters, 87.3 percent of all campus-event funding
has been devoted to the Greek system.
Are you kidding me?
I don't kid.
Won't be long now.
Why is everyone on this campus willing to let Rachel Witchburn run their lives?
'Cause she's kind of scary.
Hey, Rachel!
Check it out. The diet's working. I lost five pounds.
I think your ass found it.
[Tyler] Hey!
Hey! Sydney.
Sydney.
Hi. Listen, about last night...
Last night? Wait, let me think.
Oh yeah! When your girlfriend humiliated me.
Good times. Trust me, Rachel's not my girlfriend.
And not everyone in Greek row is like her.
And not everyone in Greek row is like her. Give me a chance to prove that to you. [girl] Sign up to run for student council.
You know, I'm actually kind of busy...
juggling seven guys at the moment. -So... -Whoa.
I got to go.
Hey, can I have a sign-up sheet?
Yeah. -You need a pen? -Actually, can I have seven?
Don't worry, ladies. We won't have to deal with the public once the Vortex is torn down
We won't have to deal with the public once the Vortex is torn down and my Greek centre's built.
Is it 4:00 already?
Loser, loser.
Kappa, Kappa.
Kappa, lose...
What?
This isn't happening.
Wow. I guess her little striptease act got some attention.
[Christy] Rachel? Rachel. Use your soothing words.
Prada, Gucci, Chanel...
Sydney, Sydney, Sydney!
-[Lenny] Hey. -Hey, guys.
Here, I'll get that for you. Here you go.
I've found a way for you to get the Vortex repaired.
We're signing you up to run for student council, all seven of you.
Very funny, Sydney. Next you'll tell us Admiral Adama's a cylon.
I have no idea what you just said. But I'm serious.
You'll all run on a ticket and you will take over the entire student council.
No non-Greek has won a student council office since 1992.
And look where that's gotten us.
Ow. Yes, George. Ow.
We've taken enough of their abuse.
I'll be your campaign manager and I'll be with you every step of the way.
I am in.
Good. Who else is with me? Come on, guys.
Do you really want to spend the rest of your college years locked up in this crap hole, disenfranchised and powerless?
locked up in this crap hole, disenfranchised and powerless?
Okay. No! George, no.
You don't want to be powerless. No.
Please don't give up.
Did the avengers give up when the black knight Sprayed New York with that foam that left everybody stuck to the ground?
that left everybody stuck to the ground? -No. -No.
-No. -No. With the help of a criminal glue specialist, they freed everyone.
I'm your criminal glue specialist!
Yeah!
[all] Yeah. Yeah.
-Now, who's running for president? -[boys] Not it.
Oh. I never win at that game.

[stammering] I don't know.
Come on, guys. It's a Saturday afternoon. What else would you be doing?
What we always do. Play fantasy video games and then reenact them.
Are you not entertained?
Hmm. Tempting. But I think we're going to stick with this.
I can't do it. My arms ache. I think I may have muscular dystrophy.
[chuckling] Muscular dystrophy is a birth defect.
Lenny, they're two pounds.
Each.
You got it?
What? I said yeah, I got... Ow!
Damn, Embele, you're going to town.
Where'd you get all that energy? I just awaken an hour ago.
-It's okay. You're going to be fine. -It fell on my foot.
[man on TV] Rachel Witchburn has led the student council to great heights over the past two years.
In addition to repaving Greek row,
Rachel beautified Greek row's grounds and expanded parking privileges for Greek row.
Re-elect Rachel Witchburn. Vision. Leadership. Progress.
I'm Rachel Witchburn, and I approve this message.

I don't think we're making much of an impression. [Sydney] Yeah. I was worried about that.
Free drinks! Free drinks over here!
Freedom to the seventh power! Free drinks!
Serve and socialize.
Who wants a burger?
-Hi. -Hi.
I just wanted to apologize for what happened.
I really am sorry.
It's okay.
So, how's life as a Kappa?
Oh, you know, it's good.
Hey, is one of these...
Yes, Lenny. The greenish-looking one is your gluten-free soy patty.
Excellent. Do you have any extra of those?
Are you allergic to gluten too? All my life.
All my life. And it is so hard to find a decent gluten-free soy patty.
Well, today's your lucky day, because these are sensational.
Lenny, this is my friend Dinky. Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Dinky. Right? Nice to meet you, Dinky.
Um, Dinky?
We're over there.
Hi, Sydney. It's nice to see you found some people you fit in with.
Mmm. It is nice, isn't it? If only there were a place where a superficial, materialistic bitch could fit in.
Oh, wait, there is.
Whatever. It's so cute, making your little friends run for student council. Mmm. It is cute, and it'll be even cuter when we win.
Mmm. It is cute, and it'll be even cuter when we win.
Just so you know, non-Greeks never win.
Yeah, just like you said new people never make it on your "hot or not" list, right?
Let me give you one tip, Sydney.
I'm the last person you want to mess with.
No. You're the first.
Come on, let's go.
It was nice seeing you, Sydney. You too, Lenny.
You realize she was flirting with you?
-Yeah. -No!
[boy] Who's going to win today? [all] Sharks going to win today!
Who, who, who?
[all] Sharks, Sharks, Sharks!
Who's gonna win today?
Well, when the temperature drops below 60, and there's a headwind,
the forces exerted on the ball create an unfavorable magnitude and direction.
The resulting spatial vector leads to an increase in the sharks' fumble ratio.
I anticipate a double-digit loss.
[man] The dude's a freak. I don't know about you, man, but I got to change my bet.
Wait a minute. I think we graduated with that dude.
[Sydney] The election's coming up and we could really use your vote.
[student] Hey, dudes, throw the frisbee back.
Go on. Someone pick it up and throw it on back.
[student] Right here!
Ow! Heads up!
[whispering] Dude, I think you have the wrong desk.
Yeah. You definitely have the wrong desk.

No, but I will keep singing unless you agree to go out with me.

No.

So, what do you guys think? This is what I wore to my college interview,
So I thought it would be, you know, a nice first date outfit.
No, it's terrible. You look like Barbara Walters.
And you said this wasn't a date. It is not a date.
We're just friends and, you know, I don't like him like that.
Only a little. You know, occasionally. When his shirt's off.

Have been on plenty of dates before. I don't know if you guys have figured this out, But I'm not exactly the prom-queen type.
Yeah, but you're pretty, Sydney. [Sydney] Thanks, George.
But I've had about as much dating experience as you guys.
Whoa! Speak for yourself.
[Lenny] I'm starting to see what you mean. You need something sexy.
But warm. Purple's pretty.
[Terrence] My mom used to wear mauve. [Gurkin] What about fuchsia?

Wow. Yeah! And I'll kick your ass.

That's nothing. You should see the plumbing.

Me and the Betas, we got in some trouble. Let's just say a few campus ordinances were violated.
A few? And you're working your hours off here?
Nice to see you recruiting my best students, Tyler.
Sydney, happy to have you here. Happy to be here.
So, do my hours tonight count towards working off Tyler's dirty deeds?
Actually, he fulfilled his requirement last year.
We just can't seem to get rid of him.
[Tyler] Watch your step. We're almost there.
This is beautiful.
If you look over there, you can almost see Greek row.
Which is probably the last thing you want to see. Yeah.
It's just... Growing up without my mom,
I was hoping that becoming a Kappa would help me connect with her.
Sydney, you don't need Kappa.
I know.
I feel close to her just being at this school.
You know, I found her name carved into my study carrel.
No way.
Hey, is this where you bring all your first non-dates?

Yeah. Yeah. Sorority girls can't get enough of it.

"Tyler, these plates are plastic. Touching them hurts my hands."
Let's just say you're the first girl I've met I thought would appreciate this place.
Well, I do, even if there was no bathroom attendant.

All right. Well...
Thank you.
I had a great time.
You're trying not to over talk right now, aren't you?
[Spanky] I'm okay. My spleen broke my fall.
Hi, guys. -Hey. -Hi, Sydney.
-Hey. -Hi, Sydney. What a surprise.
We were just watching the...
The game?
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, who's playing?
Um... The... Saint Louis Gorillas.
You guys were spying on me, and just for that, I'm not going to tell you about my date.
Oh, come on, Sydney. Nope.
Good night, boys.
Oh, man.
I should probably see a doctor.
Hey, sexy. Rachel, what the hell are you doing here?
Besides reading your boring emails, nothing.
Tell me what you were doing out with her?
You know what, Rachel? I like Sydney. Deal with it.
I don't care if you like her or not. All I care about is our Greek life center,
and Sydney and her band of goobers are screwing with our plans.
are screwing with our plans. It's not like they have a shot at winning the election, and you know it.
Maybe we should just leave them alone.
That dump is obviously really important to them. I don't know why anyone would want to live there.
That fire trap should be condemned.
Look, we can find another location. Now, get out of here already.
One date, and you're ready to blow the whole deal?
It was a hell of a date.
Normally at this time of year, I'd be reporting that Rachel Witchburn... Guys. Guys. Look.
Guys. Guys. Look. Once again has a lock on the student council presidency.
But now, there is a new player on the scene.
Terrence Lubinecki's freedom to the seventh power party.
Do they have a shot? -Can they even make a dent? -[Sydney] You look so cute, Terrence. Stay tuned.
Good looking guy.
Check it out. Maybe I'll actually vote this year.
Check it out. Maybe I'll actually vote this year. Yeah, he's cool.
Hey, Rach, which of these should I wear?
-I don't care. -But I have a date.
I don't care. Come to my room and help me get dressed.
What is wrong with you?
Rachel, you can't come in here. I just farted.
Ew. Katy, you're disgusting.
Get off me, you freaks.
What? No.
[screaming] No!
Rachel, do you want to try your soothing words?
I don't need my soothing words.
It's all become very clear to me.
Sydney White must die a social death.
And take her seven dorks with her.
Great. Here comes Prince Charming.
Guys, please, just give him a chance.
That means you, Gurkin. Put the paintball gun away.
-Hi. Come on in. -Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
You ready? Actually, I have a better idea.
We all hang here at the Vortex and order pizza.
What?
Sounds good to me.

Well. None of these other freaks have come close to winning Gurkin of Honor.

Yeah, what do you think we do? Just have sex with girls all the time.
Hate to break it to you, spanky, but we're really just regular guys.
Aw, he's like a kid who just found out there's no Santa Claus.
What?
I mean, hypothetically, you know, if there weren't a Santa Claus
which of course, there is.
You guys should come hang out sometime. Bring Gurkin of Honor.
You know, actually, we're having a party tomorrow night, you guys want to come?

Oh, you know what, okay. Bye. Bye.
How come you boys haven't come out to party before?
You guys are so cool.
Really?
Oh, yeah. We've been watching you. Where have you studs been hiding?
The building at the end of the road. It's called the Vortex 'cause it sucks in losers.
That's sexy.
Well, boys, there's seven of us and seven of you.
What's that sound like to you? Fourteen?
Sounds like a party to me.
You know, there's a hot tub out back.
Through that door there's a study that leads right to it. You can leave your clothes there.
But we don't have any swimming trunks.
Neither do we.
We'll meet you back there.
Oh, boy.
[Spanky] Girls? Where are you?
Where's the hot tub?
Marco!
[girl] They're naked!
Oh, no.
It must be cold out there.
Oh, no. [Rachel] Thanks for putting on a show, guys.
This is low, even for you, Rachel.
Aw, Sydney, so nice of you to care about them.
And since you're the mastermind behind their adorable little student council campaign,
let me be the first to break the news.
Terrence has been disqualified from running for president.
What are you talking about?
Terrence Lubinecki is not a student at Southern Atlantic.
He graduated six years ago.
I had to stay. There was just so much more learning to do.
[Whispering] Terrence, maybe you should put on some clothes.
-[man] Yeah. -Okay.
Rachel, why don't you get the hell out of here? Ooh, I love it when you get rough.
And, Ty, thanks for playing your part so well.
That's the other good news.
The Witchburn-Prince Greek life center is now a reality.
-Witchburn-Prince? What the hell? -Oh, you didn't tell her?
I thought you guys were so close. It's a little joint project of ours
and the only thing standing in our way was the Vortex. So, like you suggested, Tyler, I went ahead and had it condemned.
So, like you suggested, Tyler, I went ahead and had it condemned.
Now you can eat with the homeless every night.
You had something to do with this?
No. I mean, I said the place was a dump, but I didn't--
No. I mean, I said the place was a dump, but I didn't-- Witchburn-Prince, huh? So you wanted to tear down the Vortex.
Witchburn-Prince, huh? So you wanted to tear down the Vortex.
Yeah, I did, but-- I don't want to hear it.
-Sydney! -No.
Don't grovel, Tyler. You're above it.
Things are looking grim, brothers.
I am so sorry about this, you guys.
You should've just left us alone.
We were fine until you came along and made us your guinea pigs.
You guys.
It's so important for us to stand up to the Greeks
and show them that they can't trample all over us.
Well, it's also important for us to have a place to live.
-[Paul on phone] Hello? -Dad?
[laughing] Gotcha. You've reached royal plumbing at the white house. No, not that one.
You've reached royal plumbing at the white house. No, not that one. This is Paul and Sydney's. Leave a message.
Hi, dad. I was just calling to say I miss you.
And that's it.
Um... Everything's great here. Really great.
Everything's great here. Really great.
I love you.
[Paul] It was that message last night.
I could tell something wasn't right. I could hear it in your voice.
So I got in the van and I drove all through the night.
I was a little surprised to find you weren't at the Kappa house, though.
I wanted to tell you so many times, but...
I kept thinking about mom and I felt like I'd failed her.
And you always sounded so proud of me on the phone.
Sweetheart, following in your mother's
Sweetheart, following in your mother's footsteps is not about reliving her life.
It's about being the same kind of person she was.
Hey.
Your mom was much more than just a Kappa.
She was a woman who always fought for what she believed in, and so are you.
Nothing could make me prouder than that.
Not even when I installed that water filtration system in under an hour?
That was pretty great.
It says, "do not disturb."
Up and at 'em, guys.
It's time to make some plans.
I know you're still pissed at me, but come on.
Are you really gonna wallow here in this fleabag motel, because some prissy girly-girl who probably doesn't know who Gandalf is,
because some prissy girly-girl who probably doesn't know who Gandalf is, screwed us over?
You're right. I bet she doesn't know who Gandalf is.
We're still mad at you, though. That's okay. I want you to be mad.
I want you to get fired up so we can win this election,
because the freedom to the seventh power party will prevail.
Yeah! With our new candidate for president.
Me. I'm gonna run against Rachel.
And we're gonna take her down.
Hi, I'm Sydney White and I'm running for student council president--
Hi, I'm Sydney White and I'm running for student council president
on the freedom to the seventh power ticket.
Your papers count for three quarters of your final grade, and no late papers will be accepted.
As you're writing these papers,
I want you to think about the mechanics of modern campaigning.
You may be wondering why you should even care. Why bother voting?
The Greeks win every year and it's just one more way they run the school.
[Carlton] There's a whole lot of talk today about the need to cater to your base,
but then there's something to be said for thinking outside of that box.
for thinking outside of that box.
[Sydney] Freedom to the seventh power!
Freedom to the seventh power!
Good job.
The fact is that 80 percent of the student body at Southern Atlantic is not Greek.
Eighty percent. [Carlton] Take the Kennedy campaign in 1960.
He was inherently an outsider.
A catholic had never been elected as president,
who reached out to other outsiders.
[all] L'chaim. [Sydney] To those students I say, it's time for you to be heard.
[Carlton] Minorities, women, the poor.
[Carlton] Minorities, women, the poor. The disenfranchised won that election for John Kennedy.
The disenfranchised won that election for John Kennedy.
"Naked pain." An epic poem in 12 parts.
It's time for you to be heard, and we are here to listen.
It's a lesson worth remembering.
[Rachel] Here you go. Don't vote for Sydney White. Let's keep it Greek, all right?
Don't vote for Sydney White. Let's keep it Greek, all right? Does this look like your next president?
Vote Rachel Witchburn.
Hi, ho.
Bye, ho.
Don't vote for Sydney White. Vote Rachel Witchburn. Rachel Witchburn.
No way. You read Peoples Punisher too?
No way. You read Peoples Punisher too? I write it.
Oh, my god. It's the most genius thing ever.
Did you know that the brew house has an entire spoken-word night devoted to that blog?
-Really? -Yeah.
And I know this is really embarrassing,
but I swore that if I ever met the Peoples Punisher guy...
Well, I'd hook up with him.
Damn it!
Need some help?
Oh. Hi.
Listen, I'm really...
Is that a Stanley 22 ounce antivibe framing hammer?
Yes, it is. Can I touch it?
You can have it.
I saw you guys with the signs. I thought I could help.
And I just want to tell you I'm really sorry about what happened the other night.
I had nothing to do with what Rachel pulled.
Yeah, I was involved in the Greek Center, but Rachel twisted everything around.
Yeah. I know what that's like.
You're gonna do great at the debate tomorrow.
I thought we might do a little business.
I thought you finished Carlton's paper last week.
I did, but I wanted to add some of the ideas from our campaign.
You really are a dork.
-What just happened? -I don't-- Make it come back.
She just opened it.
Voila. One poisoned apple.
Uh... [computer] Self-destruct.
[Lenny] Oh, my god.
Oh, no.
All right, pay up.
Yes!
She's gone catatonic.
It's no use. Even I can't fix this.
My paper, due tomorrow.
The debate, tomorrow.
The debate, tomorrow. The guy definitely knew what he was doing.
What about... Ow!
I can't let her win like this.
But the debate starts in 12 hours.
I'm just gonna have to pull an all-nighter.
[man on PA] T he debate's about to begin. Candidates, please report to the stage.
We couldn't find her anywhere. Where could she be? She should be done with her paper by now.
[man on PA] We need all candidates on stage now.
Sydney. Sydney, you got to wake up.
I know you're tired, but you can't give up now.
You mean a lot to those guys out there.
You mean a lot to me.
Okay. I'm awake now. Come on.
All right. Well, I'm afraid we can't wait any longer for Ms. White.
I'm here! I'm here!
Ms. Witchburn, if you win another term as president,
what will you do differently?
Why fix what isn't broken?
This has been a great year for the university
and I am particularly proud to be breaking ground on the Greek life center very soon.
Ms. White, your rebuttal?
I guess your people couldn't make it. It's just you and your dorks.
Go, Sydney!
[girl] Go, Sydney!
[girl] Go Sydney!
I vote for Sydney!
[all] Go!
For years, you've been oppressed by the Greek elite,
who take everything for themselves and leave nothing for the rest of us.
It's time for the rest of the school to take back the school.
Yeah!
I bet most of you have no idea how great the campus a cappella group is, and why would you?
how great the campus a cappella group is, and why would you? The social and cultural landscape is entirely run by the Greeks.
The social and cultural landscape is entirely run by the Greeks.
And those guys are forced to practice in a dank basement.
that's hard on their vocal cords. [boy] Yeah!
Professor Carlton... Let her finish.
I have met so many great and interesting people here,
that I never would have met if I didn't step out of my own little world.
Before, all I wanted was to fit in.
But I've learned that we're all searching to fit in.
And we all feel like outsiders.
And we all do things and feel things
that are bizarre and unconventional and dorky.
We're all dorks.
Yeah!
My name is Sydney White. My dad's a plumber.
I collect comic books and I'm secretly terrified of balloon animals.
I'm a dork. Yeah!
I'm Tyler Prince.
I'm the current high scorer in Gurkin of Honor.
I'm a dork.
My name is... Well, it's really Sanford,
and I've never had sex with a girl before.
But I really, really want to.
I'm a dork.
Hi.
My name is Jeremy.
I used to speak only through my puppet.
I'm a dork!
My name's Moose.
When I was 13, I was the top-ranked male figure skater in the state of New Jersey.
[boy] Dude!
So I guess that makes me a dork.
I've hated Rachel Witchburn
ever since she told me I had mom arms freshman year,
and I have a voodoo doll of her in My underwear drawer and I stick pins in it.
Oh, and I'm a dork.
Hi. My name is Dinky Hodgekiss and I think I'm in love with a dork.
Let's hear it for the dorks!
Rachel Witchburn, you've exhibited
Rachel Witchburn, you've exhibited behavior unsuitable for a Kappa.
You've lied, manipulated, and verbally abused your sisters and fellow students.
And you are just such a... A bitch.
We, all of us,
We, all of us, hereby strip you of the privileges of the Kappa sisterhood.
But you can't! You can't just...
We just did.
[all] Here comes a Kappa, queen of the row.
She's hot, she's cool, she ain't no ho.
She's got style, she's got class.
Prada... And from behind, a kicking... Gucci...
Oh, no. You're not getting sick, are you? Nah. It's just the mulch.
Hey, we're from Southeast State and we're lost. Can you help us?
I will be your guide.
Give me five minutes.
Take all the time you need.
Okay. Bye.
Terrence! What happened?
Hey, guys. I finally perfected my predictive analytic probability theory.
It can predict anything from the behavior of amino acids in a stable isotope peptide bond
the behavior of amino acids in a stable isotope peptide bond to the outcome of sporting events.
So I sold it to ibet.com for ten million dollars.
Are you kidding me?
You are rich man!
You know I helped. I did.
Oh, let's take a picture.
Come on, come on.
Get together.
Say cheese.
[all] Cheese.
[Sydney] So, that's the story of Sydney White.
My mom was right. I did make friends for life.
All the food's gonna go bad.
Yeah, I drew up a list. I'll hit the store before it gets all bought out.
I'll hit the store before it gets all bought out.
Fuck.
Can you save it?
No, no way.
No, I gotta start over from scratch.
I'll call the studio when the phones get back up, see if they can extend my deadline. Ah.
What choice do they have?
Are you kiddin'? They could whip up
some bad Photoshop poster in an afternoon,
they do it all the time, two big heads.
I should've brought it downstairs with me last night, I was just stupid, I guess.
Well, sweetie, you couldn't exactly know
that a tree was gonna come flying through the window.
Yeah, I'll hit the hardware store too, get some plastic sheeting and duct tape
and seal this up before it gets dark, you know.
Order in some new glass.
Aw, you know what?
That was your grandfather's tree, the one he planted.
I used to play in that tree. It's just stuff though.
You know, we're safe, that's all that counts.
Yeah.
Mom, Dad, you gotta come see!
Hey, Billy, take it easy, all right?
I really don't want you running all over the place.
But you gotta come look!
The boathouse is all bashed. Holy crap!
Billy!
Sorry, Mom, but you just gotta come, come on.
Whoa!
-Whoa. -Whoa.
-Whoa. -Whoa. [Billy] Come on!
Having spoken, the Doomsayer departs.
How do you two always manage to make me laugh?
You have incredibly low standards. Mhm.
All right, let's go see the damage.
No!
Norton's tree. Yeah.
You mean the dead one I've been asking him to take down for three years before it finally blew over?
That tree?
It really got smushed.
You ain't kiddin'.
Look at that.
[Billy] What is it, Daddy?
Mist?
On the lake? We've had mist on the lake before.
Coming off the mountain like that?
Two fronts meeting, leftover from the storm?
Two fronts meeting, leftover from the storm? Something like that?
You sure?
Honey, I'm not the weatherman.
Why don't you take Billy, get him dressed, I'll take him to town with me.
All right. Where you goin'?
I'm gonna go have a little chat with our neighbor about his tree.
Hon. Don't worry, I'm not gonna punch him in the nose.
You know what he's gonna say.
He's gonna say "Sue me," which, I don't know, maybe we should.
Honey, one property dispute with this guy
is enough to last me a lifetime.
I'm gonna ask for his insurance information.
Okay.
That's all. Yeah.
[Mr. Norton] Motherfucker!
Aw, shit!
Oh, you motherfucker!
Cock sucker!
Turn on, full choke, pull five choke.
I guess you've seen the...
Boathouse.
Yeah, and?
Nothin'.
Just think we should trade insurance info, you know?
That's all.
Oh, my insurance guy's gonna love me.
The 1980.
I was gonna bring the station wagon, but, I don't know,
the weather was so beautiful coming out of New York, I just...
You know, top down.
I'm sorry, man, I mean it.
Sincerely.
That's nice of you to say.
No, that car was cherry, I hate to see it like that.
Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll find my insurance guy's number, I'll bring it by later.
Is that okay? No problem.
So, David.
You're not heading into town today by any chance, are you?
[David] Well, CMP's out in force.
Maybe we'll get our power back.
[Mr. Norton] That was some storm, huh?
One for the books, yeah.
For a moment there last night I thought we were gonna take off and head for Oz.
WZON is off the air,
but Portland's still broadcasting.
Daddy, look!
Guys from the base.
From up the mountain? [David] Uh huh.
The Arrowhead Project?
Well, you're a local.
Any idea what they do up there?
Missile defense research, you know,
I'm sure you've heard the stories.
Oh, sure. The woman at the laundromat says that
they have a crashed flying saucer up there with frozen alien bodies.
Right, Miss Edna, yeah.
Miss Tabloid.
"I Had Bigfoot's Baby".
"Satan's Face Appears in Oil Well Fire".
You know, real reliable stuff.
[David] Oh, they're in a hurry.
Maybe their power's out too.
Ah, still no signal.
Why don't you go ahead? I'm gonna try Steph on the payphone. [Billy] Can I go with Mr. Norton, Daddy?
Sure, if you promise to hold his hand, I guess.
[Billy] Yeah? Yeah.
Here's a list.
-Okay. -Okay?
Meet you guys in there.
Hold hands.
[Man] I'm sorry, I didn't know it was your sister.
[Kid] looks so freaky.
Sally, hey. [Sally] Hey, Mr. Drayton.
You guys look jammed up.
Yeah, well, half the staff didn't show, plus the power's out.
Oh, no. What, no backup generator?
Only to keep the food cold.
Everything else, welcome to the Dark Ages and bring your checkbook.
Hey, Thursday night, Steph and I wanna date night.
Babysit? Heck yeah, I'm there.
[David] Oh my God.
[Ollie] The storm.
Everybody's stocking up, been like this since we opened.
Crappy day, huh?
Eh, everyone's a little pissed off this morning.
Morning, Mrs. Carmody.
[Mrs. Carmody] With lines like these, I don't know how good it is,
but I guess we'll have to make do.
Keep your head down, pal. I know it.
Hey, champ.
Your wife should be a doctor. She could make a fortune in Manhattan with this handwriting.
Yeah, it takes some getting used to.
Why don't you get your stuff? I'll meet you at the checkout. Okay, done.
Hey, David. Thanks for helping me out today.
[Billy] Are you and Mr. Norto gonna be friends now, Daddy?
Oh, I don't know. Friends might be stretching it a little.
Guess you're not mad at each other anymore.
I guess not.
Hey, and that's a start, eh?
[Man] I'm sorry, ma'am, the register's down. The power outage got us too.
Hopefully we'll have power up pretty soon.
[Officer Jessup] The bus leaves in 30 minutes. We'll make it, okay?
You guys get the goodies, I'll wait in line.
[Man] I need some change on register 5.
[Jessup] Good morning, Ms. Reppler.
[Billy] Hello, Ms. Reppler.
Well, hello to you, Billy Drayton.
How'd you hold up in the storm?
We had a tree come through the picture window last night, right in my studio.
And the boathouse got all smushed. Mr. Norton's tree fell on it.
[Irene] Oh, ouch.
Sorry to hear that.
[David] Well, how'd you guys make out?
[Hattie] Oh, we're fine. It's the listings I'm worried about.
At the very least, I'll bet every one of our "For Sale" signs fell over.
[Irene] We had damage at the school, wouldn't you know?
That's what we get for not fixing that roof when we should've.
But with funds being cut every year,
you'd think educating children
would be more of a priority in this country,
but you'd be wrong.
Government's got better things to spend our money on,
like corporate handouts and building bombs.
Daddy, is there a fire? Is Mommy all right?
I'm sure she's fine. Don't worry, okay?
[Bud] Mind what you're doing, Sally.
[Donaldson] Oh, come on, we'v got 10 days leave. Check our papers.
[M.P. Officer] Look, I told you all leaves are canceled.
I don't know why. I gotta go check the pharmacy out.
You men meet me back at the jeep in 5 minutes.
That's an order.
[Morales] Shit, man. Another half an hour, we'd of been gone.
Oh my God.
[Dan] Something in the mist!
Something in the mist took John Lee!
Dan, catch your breath!
Something in the mist took John Lee.
I could hear him screaming.
Shut the doors! Shut the doors, my God!
[Billy] Daddy, I'm scared. Can we go home?
[Dan] Don't go out there. There's something in the mist, it took John Lee!
[Man] Screw that, I'm getting in my car.
[Dan] Mister, no!
Please hold me.
It's okay, it's okay.
[Ambrose] It's a pollution cloud, from the mills, down in Rumsford.
Some kind of chemical explosion, has to be.
[Ollie] What is it?
What's going on?
It's death.
[Mike] That was an earthquake.
[Ambrose] I tell ya, the goddamn mills blew up!
Is everyone okay? Is anyone hurt?
Everybody just stay put, okay? Just stay inside the store.
I can't. I can't stay here, I gotta get home to my kids.
[Mrs. Carmody] No, no, don't go out there.
It's death out there.
It's the end of days. Stop it, okay? Stop it.
Please, everybody, everybody just relax. -Okay? -[Bud] He's right.
Let's just stay cool, let's just try to figure out what happened.
I'm sorry. I can't just stay here, I have to get home to my kids.
[Dan] Ma'am, no, you can't go out there.
That could be a poisonous gas cloud.
Didn't you hear that man screaming?
I agree, let's stay here until we figure it out.
You're not listening!
I can't stay here.
Wanda's looking after little Victor, she's only 8.
Sometimes she forgets she's supposed to be watching him, you know?
I told them I'd only be gone a few minutes.
She's only 8!
For their sakes, don't.
Well, is anybody gonna help me?
[David] Shh, it's okay, pal.
Won't somebody here see a lady home?
You?
You?
It's okay, buddy. You?
Ma'am, please. I got my own boy to worry about.
I hope you all rot in hell.
[Ollie] Ma'am, please, wait until...
[Bud] Okay, let's start cleaning up, okay?
Get the spilled bottles, broken glass, stuff like that.
Aisle 3 has medical supplies.
Okay, okay, it's okay.
Easy champ, come on.
All right, hey, hey, hey.
You can't keep crying like this, pal.
Come on.
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Come on, you all right? I want Mommy.
All right, I know you do. Okay.
Just try to breathe, okay?
Just try to breathe, pal, it's okay.
It's all right.
I haven't seen him suck his thumb like this since he was two years old.
He's in shock.
I think we all are.
You haven't met.
Amanda Dunfrey. She's new in town as of this semester.
Teaches 3rd grade, and the special ed kids
Teaches 3rd grade, and the special ed kids now that Mosher's retired.
She's wonderful, the kids love her.
And David's an artist, he does movie posters and such.
Oh, and me.
Lord, I'm babbling away like some old biddy at a tea party.
My nerves are jangled, I guess.
Boy settle down?
How is he?
Still hot.
[Amanda] Why don't I get him some aspirin?
Aisle 3. Okay. Thanks.
How's Dan? Ah, his nose stopped bleeding.
He's calmer now, somebody gave him a Valium.
I can't believe the way he ran in here.
Never seen him like that.
I need something to cover my boy up.
You got any blankets?
Furniture pads, loading dock.
Gonna keep checking on people, if you need anything, just holler.
You bet. Sally, you mind?
Oh, I'd love to. I really should help him clean up.
I'll take him. -Okay. -Daddy, don't go!
No, I'll be gone two seconds, Big Bill. Come on, I'm gonna get your blanket.
Mrs. Reppler's here, and so is Mrs. Turman.
I'll be close by, okay?
Don't worry, I'm not far. Okay?
Let me look at you.
Hm?
[Hattie] Wanna lie Down? Yeah.
Yeah.
There you go. [Nortan] As soon as it blows away we can walk out of here safe and free,
but we have to be smarter.
The first thing we need to do is keep our wits about us and find out what's happening.
[Biker] Well, how we gonna do that, my man?
We've got no phone signal, we've got no radio.
[Nortan] I'm sure they're working on those problems as we speak.
It stands to reason that restoring communications
would be their top priority.
[David] Oh, shit.
Shit!
God damn it!
Bitch!
[Nortan] It's obvious that we're in some kind of natural disaster here.
[Biker] Ain't nothing obvious bout this sombitch from where I sit.
[Ambrose] There ain't nothing natural about it either.
[Biker] That's right.
[Mrs. Carmody] It's Judgment Day, and it's come round at last.
There is nothing more obvious or natural than that.
[Biker] Aw, fuck now.
You've done that to yourself by a life of sin and disillusion.
Hey, whoa!
David!
Hey, you guys hear that?
The generator? We're just gonna check it out.
No, no, I turned the generator off,
it was backing up.
Nobody else heard that sound? What sound?
I don't know, like a weird noise,
back there in the dark.
Like something was pressing against the door.
Did you hear it before the lights went out or after?
No, only after.
After, but look, I heard it, okay?
Nobody's calling you a liar.
That's what it sounds like. [Jim] No, no, no, no, now don't be that way, Mr. Drayton.
[Jim] No, no, no, no, now don't be that way, Mr. Drayton.
[Jim] You had a scare, no doubt.
Let's say we all go check it out.
Here.
Man.
It's pretty rank in here.
Myron, go check it out. [Myron] All right.
[Jim] Go on, fire it up.
All right, turn it off!
[Myron] Holy crow, don't that stink.
Something's got the exhaust vent plugged up from the outside.
[Norm] You get it running long enough to raise that door a little, I'll go out and clear whatever's blocking it.
[David] No, no, you can't do that.
[Jim] Why not? It's an electric door, right?
[Ollie] Well, yeah, but it may not be wise to send him out there.
[Myron] Okay, I'll do it.
No, look, it's not about who goes out there-
[Myron] What, don't you think I can do it? -[Norm] Hey, I want to go, it was my idea.
-[Norm] Hey, I want to go, it was my idea.
[David] Whoa, wait, wait, just stop, okay?
Jim, right?
Myron? You guys are...
Well, you don't seem to understand,
or you're trying real hard not to. This isn't an ordinary mist, okay?
You open that door and something gets in here-
Like what?
Well, like whatever made that noise I heard.
Are you guys being willfully dense?
Mr. Drayton, you know, pardon me, but I'm not convinced that you heard anything.
but I'm not convinced that you heard anything.
I mean, we're not hearing anything now, right? Anybody?
See?
Now, I know, I know, you're a big shot artist
Now, I know, I know, you're a big shot artist with connections in New York and Hollywood and all that,
but that don't make you better than anybody else, not in my book.
Hey, I didn't say that.
[Jim] Nor do I like being talked down to
or called stupid by a guy who went to college just 'cause he's got the jitters.
Fellas, it doesn't even matter about the generator, the food will keep without it.
[Jim] Kid, I'm gonna start th motor, you raise the door,
[Jim] Kid, I'm gonna start th motor, you raise the door, and you yell out when you got enough room.
Yeah. Okay, good.
Wait!
You guys are gonna let this kid risk his life over a generator that doesn't even matter?
Would you just shut the fuck up already? [Ollie] Norm!
[Jim] Listen, Mr. Drayton, I tell you what.
The next time you got something to say,
you count your teeth.
Because I'm sick to death of your bullshit.
All right?
Come on, Myron.
[David] This is crazy! [Ollie] Leave 'em be.
What am I, impugning their manhood or something?
Listen, they've lost their sense of proportion.
What's going on here? Out there in the market they were scared and confused,
Out there in the market they were scared and confused, in here there's a problem they can solve. So, they're goddamn gonna solve it.
So, they're goddamn gonna solve it.
[Jim] Ready, kid? Let's rock!
Norm, come on.
Don't, man.
It's a mistake.
Pussy.
Hold up!
So, any boogeyman?
[Jim] Pretty scary, ain't it, Norm?
Yeah, right.
Norm.
Norm!
What the fuck? Get it off, get it off! Get this friggin' thing off me!
Get this friggin' thing off me! Get it off!
Help me, help me, help me!
There's more, there's more!
Somebody help me.
Somebody help me.
What the fuck are you waiting for?
Hang on!
[Ollie] Hold him still! Hold him still!
[Jim] Oh, Jesus...
Shit, oh shit!
[Jim] Oh shit!
[Ollie] Dave, it's no good!
[David] Start the generator!
Hey, I'm sorry.
But how the hell was I supposed to know what you meant?
You said you heard something.
How was I supposed to know what you meant?
You should've said what you meant better.
I don't know, I thought maybe it was a big bird or something.
You got that kid killed.
Did you get a good look at it, huh?
Did you get a good look at what you did? Huh?
Huh? [Ollie] David! Don't hit him anymore! -And you too! -It doesn't solve anything.
Assholes! You got that kid killed, and I got his fucking blood on me!
Okay, I'm done.
Okay.
What's next?
Kill the generator.
That's the first thing.
[Jim] I'm sorry.
Jesus Christ, oh God.
I'm sorry about the kid.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
We oughta get outta here.
Hey man, we didn't twist this on him.
Yeah, he's a fuckin' kid. He's supposed to be stupid.
What's your excuse, huh?
Get outta here.
Go back in the market, stay by the door.
Don't say anything to anybody.
Not yet.
Not yet.
[Ollie] Shit.
[Ollie] David? Need a little light here.
We have to tell 'em.
The people in the market, we have to stop them from going outside.
[David] They won't believe us.
They have to. I'm not sure I believe it, I was here.
What we saw was impossible. You know that, don't you?
You know that, don't you?
I mean, what do we say?
How do we convince them?
Ollie, what the hell were those tentacles even attached to?
Oh my god. Are you all right?
Shh, shh, shh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's not my blood, I'm fine.
What the hell happened?
I'll explain. Give me a minute, okay?
I need to deal with something first.
Please, I've got to...
I can't let Billy see me like this, he's scared enough.
Just give me a minute, keep him distracted. Okay?
Okay.
[jim] Hey, look. I'm sorry about Norm.
[Ollie] Me too.
I mean, I ain't making excuses, I'm just saying.
Look, we need to tell people. We don't need to say how it went down
or anything like that, but we're in the deep shit here,
people need to know.
[Myron] What about the out of towners?
We've got plenty of them in the store. Where do we even start?
Brent Norton? [Jim] That windbag?
He's an important attorney in New York.
That fella could be on the bench one day. Counts a lot for people in this town, or anywhere.
Yeah, that's right.
Do it quick, David.
We've gotta discuss how we're gonna stop that thing getting in here.
Wait, what do you mean getting in?
You shut the loading door.
Yeah, but the entire front of the store is plate glass.
Jesus Christ.
Um, listen.
That guy who came in here with the bloody nose.
They're, they're... We saw tentacles.
It ain't going very well, is it?
Nah uh.
You, what? Come here.
Come here.
Tell him.
It's true.
Tentacles. Yeah.
Um, gentlemen, I'm sorry,
I'm just not that stupid.
I mean, what do you take me for?
I'm shocked.
I'm shocked.
I'm shocked, it's pretty tasteless using what's happening here to try to make me look like an idiot.
No, no, no, that's not what's going on here.
Look, come back to the loading dock, okay? I'll show you.
Blood, and a chuck of tentacle on the floor. No.
No, what do you mean no?
Uh, no. We've got real problems to deal with here,
and this pathetic attempt at a joke
has gone far enough.
Mr. Norton. What reason could we possibly have-
Oh, please, please!
This is payback for the lawsuit that I filed against him last year,
and you guys are backing him up.
So, winning wasn't enough, huh?
You wanted to humiliate me some more.
Show me a rubber snake while these hicks stand around laughing their asses off.
Watch who you're calling a hick. Myron, Myron, Myron!
Hey, hey, fuck- Mr. Norton, I swear.
Mr. Norton, I swear. You've got us all wrong.
You're not too crazy about out of towners, are ya?
I only spend my money and I pay my taxes here,
and I've seen you talking behind my back.
How y'all stick together?
Well, don't I feel foolish?
I actually thought you were being kind to me today. Well, thanks for setting me straight.
And I'm glad that tree fell on your boathouse, you know that? Glad. Smashed it in pretty good, didn't it? Fantastic.
Now all of y'all, just stay out of my way-
I know you're scared, man. I'm scared too.
Lives are at stake around here.
-David, I- -Okay, my son's life. Now, I need you.
Brent, please, get your head out of your ass.
All right? I'll drag you back there if I have to. Come here.
-David, get your- -No, I need- Get your God damn hands off of me!
I'll sue your ass again!
Sue your ass! And this time you'll go to jail.
This man assaulted me.
He assaulted me. You were witness to it.
This man's crazy, he's crazy. No.
He isn't. I wish he was, but he isn't.
Everyone in the store. You want to come back here?
There's something that you need to hear,
it concerns you all. Okay?
[Bud] Wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't know what you people think you're doing.
You drinking?
For Christ's sake, Ollie.
Do you want me to report you? You want to lose your job? Look, I'm gonna be taking down names, starting with you.
And I am prepared to file a police report.
Fine, Bud, write down your names. I will.
And in the meantime, shut the fuck up and listen.
This is Mr. David Drayton.
You need to hear what he's got to say if you're thinking about leaving.
Go hang out with the ladies, all right?
Listen, don't be scared.
It's okay.
Okay.
This is how it is.
Now, I don't know what this mist is,
but there are things in it, and they're dangerous, like Dan said.
[Dan] That's right.
That's exactly right.
[Mike] What kinda things?
I never saw it, it happened too fast.
I got knocked down.
Five us went back in the loading dock.
It was Jim, Myron, Ollie, me,
Norm, the bag boy.
And we opened the door- Where's Norm?
Where's Norm? So Norm could go out and clear the vent for the generator.
Something came out of the mist and took him. Took him? What do you mean?
Just killed him. I mean, dragged him off.
Now, guys, I don't know what these things are.
All we saw were tentacles.
[Woman] Tentacles?
Tentacles, he says.
Tentacles from Planet X.
No, it's a lie, you know.
All these people do is just lie each other up.
It's a pile of shit.
Of course it's a lie, of course it's a lie,
it's lunacy!
And from the look of it, the tentacles are coming out of the beer cans.
All right, Bud, don't take our word for it.
Go look.
What the hell is that?
It appears we may have a problem of some magnitude here.
Let me...
Help these people.
Let me preach your word.
Let me shine your light.
'Cause they're not all bad.
They can't all be bad.
Some can be saved, can't they?
Yes, some can be brought to heaven's holy gates
Yes, some can be brought to heaven's holy gates through your grace.
I have to believe that,
though I know most people swim in a lake of fire forever.
If I can save a few, even one,
then my life will have counted for something.
I will have pulled my weight,
I will have earned my place at your side,
I will have served a purpose here on this earth.
I will have served a purpose here on this earth. Hello?
What?
I just need to use the bathroom.
Oh.
Okay, well then, have at it.
Ma'am, I just want you to know that it's okay,
being scared, I mean.
And, well, if you need a friend, you know,
And, well, if you need a friend, you know, someone to talk to-
I have a friend, God up above.
I talk to him every day.
Don't you condescend me.
I'm sorry? Not ever.
You don't mock me.
That's not what I was doing.
Look, I tell you what. The day I need a friend like you,
I'll just have myself a little squat and shit one out.
Maybe you do believe this,
maybe they're not lies, they're delusions, whatever.
The fact remains the evidence here is flimsy,
it's bordering on ludicrous. Hey, this isn't a court room.
You're not arguing a case, and you're doing nothing but damage talking the way you are.
And you can throw as much cow's blood around the loading dock as you want to,
you still haven't fooled anyone.
[Ollie] Leave it alone, David.
You can't convince some people there's a fire even when their hair is burning.
Denial is a powerful thing.
Well, keep talking.
I'll have no part of it, nor would any thinking person.
Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer.
There's no defense against the will of God.
There's no court of appeals in hell.
There's no defense here either,
not even with all the fertilizer in the world. Not even if you stack it as high as you can,
it's still just bags of shit, isn't it?
Those of you who want to discuss this thing rationally
to find a means of rescue are welcome to join me.
Those who want to stack dog food, knock yourselves out.
We got those windows taped up as best we could,
it should help.
Yeah, I think so.
Duct tape and dog food bags.
That bad? It's not good.
There's none so blind as those who will not see.
Open your eyes.
Let the scales fall away.
This has all been written.
Revelations, chapter 15.
"And the temple was filled with smoke
from the glory of God, and from his power.
And no one could enter the temple
until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed."
Well, what are you saying?
What are you proposing?
That we all prepare to meet our maker.
Oh, prepare to meet shit.
Lady, your tongue must be hung in the middle
so that it could waggle at both ends.
No, the end time has come.
Not in flames, but in mist. Come here!
Easy, man!
How about if your ass prepares to meet my size 10 work boot, how bout that?
Hey, there's no call for that.
Yeah, Myron, please, calm your friend down.
[Mrs. Carmody] I'm trying to save your soul, you stupid man. Doubters will doubt till the end.
Don't worry, Billy, it's okay.
A monstrosity did pull that poor boy away.
Things in the mist. Do you doubt?
Do you?
Then go out.
Go out and say "How do you do?"
Shut up, lady!
For God's sakes!
Look, you'll have to stop now, you're scaring the children.
They should be scared.
Oh yes, they should.
Their beautiful, pure little minds
have been corrupted with lies, lies.
have been corrupted with lies, lies. All this talk of a modern God, or no God.
All this talk of a modern God, or no God.
There is one God.
The God of the Israelites.
And he is a stern and vengeful God.
And we have been mocking him far too long.
And now he demands retribution and blood.
It is time to declare yourselves.
Take sides, the saved and the damned.
Read the Good Book, it calls for expiation, blood!
Read the Good Book, it calls for expiation, blood! What?
Blood.
Little Normie was first,
and now God calls the rest of us.
The bill is due.
It must be paid.
As Abraham prepared to sacrifice his only son
to prove his love for God, so...
-[loud slap] -Enough.
Another down payment.
A few more pennies in the jar.
Now that's nice. See, I can't smack her, but it's okay for you?
I'm sorry everybody, but this lady's perspective
I'm sorry everybody, but this lady's perspective is a little too Old Testament for my tastes.
They'll come for you.
Maybe tonight when darkness comes.
They'll come tonight. And they'll take someone else.
See if they don't.
And when they do, you will cry to God,
and you will beg Mother Carmody to show you the way.
That's fine.
Until then if you don't shut up, I'll wrap this tape around your mouth.
You just try it, Ollie Weeks.
And you, bitch.
You hit me again, if you dare.
You'll be on your knees to me before this is through.
Those of you who aren't locals should know that Mrs. Carmody is known in town for being unstable.
that Mrs. Carmody is known in town for being unstable.
No shit. What was your first clue?
Hi.
Sup, little dude?
How come your friends don't come get us?
They got tanks and stuff, right?
Why can't you just call 'em?
Phones don't work.
But don't you got like a radio?
Hey champ, what's going on?
I want their friends to come rescue us.
They would if they could, pal, they're stuck here just like us.
-But- -Shh. Guys, we could use a hand over there.
Yeah, sure thing. Troop, off your asses.
You all right? I don't like that scary lady.
Oh, man, I don't either.
But you know what?
Maybe she's scared too.
You think?
You think Mommy's okay?
Billy...
I'm sorry about the times I was bad to her.
Oh, hey.
Mommy loves you very much,
and I bet she's fine.
And I promise you, I'm gonna do everything I can
And I promise you, I'm gonna do everything I can to get us back to her.
-Okay? -Okay.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
So we can use the charcoal fluid and the mops to make torches,
and we've got knives and stuff, God knows.
This may be a silly question, Bud, but do you happen to have a gun in the store?
Here? No.
Please, this isn't Los Angeles.
I've got a shotgun in my truck.
I could try for it if you want.
Oh God, I don't think that would be a good idea, Mr. Cornell.
Hold on.
This gun, uh, my husband's idea.
He's away on business a lot. It's not even loaded.
Ain't much use unloaded, ma'am.
You know how to use that?
Well, I shot it once on a pistol range,
hit the target a few times.
So, we've got a gun.
Anybody know how to shoot it?
Well, I mean?
I do.
You?
Ollie, please.
Some target shooting. State champion in '94.
Hey, you're crazy if you go out there. Let us pass!
Let us pass, please!
Let's just talk this thing through. [Norton] We have, and we made our decision.
[Norton] We have, and we made our decision. We're leaving.
Hey, Mr. Mackey's gonna barbecue some chicken on the gas grill.
Why don't we just sit down and- What, and let you keep on talking?
No, I've been in far too many court rooms to fall for that.
You've already psyched out half a dozen of my people already. Your people?
What kind of talk is that? They are people, that's all.
Now, listen everyone.
We are experiencing some kind of disaster. I don't know whether it's man-made or natural,
but I do know that it's definitely not supernatural,
or Biblical. And no offense, Mrs. Carmody,
but the only way we're gonna help ourselves is to seek rescue.
We're going out.
Brent, look. I'm not discussing this any further.
I know.
I just want to ask a favor.
Tie this around your waist. What for?
It'll let us know you got at least 300 feet.
I'll do it.
Are you throwing in with them?
Me? No thanks.
I think your man there's a little too tightly wound.
Gonna get somebody killed.
I'm thinking we could use that shotgun of yours.
I saw where you parked when I pulled in.
Red pickup, right? Far entrance?
Son, you've got brass balls.
The shells are in the glove compartment, drive it back.
All right.
Just see they're paying out this line.
Line's up, I'll cut her loose. Just so you understand.
Yeah.
You sure there's no way I can talk you out of this?
David, there's nothing out there.
David, there's nothing out there. Nothing in the mist.
What if you were wrong?
Then I guess the joke would be on me after all.
We're gonna send back help.
You'll die out there, all of you.
Hey, crazy lady. I believe in God too,
I just don't think he's the bloodthirsty asshole
you make him out to be.
Well, you take that up with the devil when you run into him.
Just chat it over at your leisure.
Well, let's strike out toward the center of town.
Keep it loose.
[Jim] Nice and easy.
Keep goin'.
Look.
It's goin'.
They're doing good.
Put it down!
Pull!
I'm slipping!
Pull! Back up, back up, back up!
Get it off!
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Cut the rope!
Shut the door!
Now do you see?
Now do you believe?
About a half hour of daylight left.
Guys, how's it going with these work lights?
We're getting them rigged up, all right.
Yeah, check it out.
All right, all right, save it, save it. These batteries ain't topped up.
If you turn the lights on, it's gonna drain them quick.
How quick? Five minutes, maybe 10?
Yeah, if that.
Okay. Emergencies only.
If something gets in the store.
Holy Jesus, you scared the shit outta me.
Oh, Sally, I'm sorry, really.
I thought I'd come in and say hi and see how you were holding up.
-Hi. -Hi.
Barely, how about you?
I'm worried about my folks, I guess. You know, they live up on Shorham Road,
that's less than 5 miles from here.
Oh, how about yours?
Oh, they're out of town right now.
They're at my aunt's in Boston, so.
That's lucky. That means they're okay.
I hope so.
So...
How soon you shippin' out?
Uh, a couple weeks.
Scared about going over there?
Yeah.
Hey, Wayne? Hm?
How come you never asked me out?
We flirted all through high school, I know you like me.
So, how come?
I'm stupid, I guess.
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
Don't be, I just...
I just didn't really want it to happen like this, you know?
Some shitty locker room at work.
Can we just stay in here a while then?
Okay, just you and me?
The parking lot lamps turned on.
[Ollie] They're on a timer. Must be a different one that's live.
[Dan] Maybe we could tie into them somehow.
Get some electricity in here.
That would mean walking out the door.
Ah, God!
Oh my God. Billy, Billy.
David! David!
Look!
My God.
Bugs?
Not like any I've ever seen.
[Mrs. Carmody] "They came out of the smoke.
Locusts upon the earth.
And unto them was given power,
even as the scorpions of the earth have power."
Ah, wow.
Look at those stingers.
Dear God.
Holy shit!
Myron, get the ones in the back.
God, I think they're attracted to the light.
Look out, look out, look out!
Douse the light!
[Jim] Look out, look out!
Move, move!
Light, light, light, light, light!
[Mrs. Carmody] "And there come a voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels...
Go your ways, and pour out the vials
Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth."
Ollie, the glass is gonna give!
Shit. [Ollie] Oh my God, they turned on all the lights.
Jim, Myron!
Fire! Light it! Light it!
Come on, come on!
Sally, look out!
Let me see, let me see sweetheart, let me see.
No, you're gonna be okay, you're gonna be okay.
Let me see, let me see.
You're fine, you're gonna be okay, you're gonna be okay.
Gimme the lighter, for the fire!
Breathe, stay with me, Sally. Sweetheart, come on, come on.
Goddamn childproofing sons of bitches.
Oh shit!
Shoot it!
I can't, I'll smash the window!
Go, go!
Get down!
Shit!
Ollie, you want these lights on or off? Leave them on!
Kill it!
Bring torches! We need something to keep 'em out!
Come on! Sally!
Where are the goddamn extinguishers?
Get it, get it, get it!
Bring torches! We need torches at the window!
Plug that hole!
Dad!
Down, down, lay down!
My life.
My life for you, your will be done.
Daddy!
Daddy!
No! Daddy! -Billy! -Daddy!
Billy!
Dad!
Dad! Billy, please!
Billy!
[Bobby] Hurry up with the blankets!
[Joe] It hurts so bad!
It hurts so bad!
Did we get 'em? Did we get 'em all?
She was right.
She said that it would happen like this.
She said that they would come at night.
She told us someone would die.
Mommy.
Shh, shh, shh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's just a dream.
It's just a bad dream.
I want my mommy.
I know.
I know, of course you do.
I want to go home.
Just sleep.
Everything will be better in the morning.
I think he likes you.
Well, I hate that I had to lie to him.
You have kids?
No.
I always wanted to, but things haven't been working out.
Right now I'm thinking maybe that's for the best.
I saw creatures fly into the store tonight,
they shouldn't exist.
I keep thinking I'm gonna wake up in a rubber room.
You're not alone in that. We're all right there with you.
This isn't gonna end, is it?
[Ollie] David.
It's Joe, he's getting worse.
Joe.
How you holdin' up, partner?
[Joe] David, is that you?
Yeah, pal, how are doin'?
It's bad, he's bad.
I didn't know anything could hurt like this.
If you guys can't help me, you gotta end it, okay?
Ollie's got that gun, right?
Right? No, no way.
[Joe] You can't fuck with me on this, bro.
Not with me like this.
I'll do it.
Just give me the gun!
We're not there yet, okay? Please!
Joe, listen.
Pal.
We're gonna work something out,
I just need you to hang in a little longer, okay? Can you do that?
Stay with him, I'll be back.
Hattie, I need to go to the bathroom, will you watch Billy?
Hattie?
See anything?
The last of those bugs went away about four.
Dawn's coming.
What's on your mind?
It's Joe.
If we don't get him on some serious antibiotics he's gonna die of infection.
Plus he needs painkillers in the worst way.
All we've got here is liquor and aspirin.
You thinking about going to the pharmacy next door?
Irene Reppler says they've got Silvadene. You know, the stuff they use in burn wards.
She knows where they keep it. Slow down.
You can't actually be thinking of doing this.
I'm also thinking beyond that. We have to get out of here.
I mean, permanently. Why?
We've got plenty to eat.
And what happens when one of those things decides to break through this window?
I'm talking one of the big ones, like the one that killed Norm.
Yeah, then the flaming torch idea didn't work so well, did it?
We almost burned the goddamn store down.
It's Hattie.
Here?
Gently now, gently.
One, two, three!
I don't know how long she was there like that, lying there next to us.
I thought she was sleeping.
I got my 4-wheel drive.
It's out there.
You're talking about leaving?
Well, we should hit the pharmacy first.
We gotta bring back supplies for the injured. I mean, if we don't, Joe Eagleton's gonna die,
I mean, if we don't, Joe Eagleton's gonna die, and we can't let that happen.
But after that...
Look, my Land Cruiser can hold eight people.
I say we drive south as far as the fuel takes us and try to keep clear of this mist.
That's it?
That's the plan?
That's what I got. No, you can't mean it.
Not after what happened to Norton and his group. No, no, no. Amanda, think.
Norton got over 200 feet from this store, that's how much rope played out.
I'm parked half that distance from here.
But who knows how far this mist has spread. It could be the entire eastern seaboard.
Yeah, it could be the whole world for all we know, wouldn't make us any less dead, now would it?
We have 1 gun, how many rounds?
We have 1 gun, how many rounds? We got 10 left.
10 rounds, Jesus.
Okay, so 10.
Want another reason to get the hell outta here? I'll give you the best one.
Her.
Mrs. Carmody.
She's our very own Jim Jones.
I'd like to leave before people start drinking the Kool-Aid.
He's right.
The flakier people get, the better she's gonna look.
No, I don't buy that. It's obvious she's nuts.
Look, a few people, maybe. But- No, I count 4.
She's preaching to 'em right now. By noon, she'll have 4 more.
By tomorrow night, when those things come back, she'll have a congregation,
and then we can start worrying about who she's gonna sacrifice to make it all better.
who she's gonna sacrifice to make it all better.
Hm?
You, Amanda?
My little boy?
[Dan] He's right.
You don't have much faith in humanity, do you?
None whatsoever. I can't accept that.
People are basically good, decent.
My God, David, we're a civilized society.
Sure, as long as the machines are working and you can dial 9-1-1,
but you take those things away, you throw people in the dark,
you scare the shit outta them, no more rules.
you scare the shit outta them, no more rules. You'll see how primitive they get.
If you scare people badly enough,
you can get 'em to do anything.
They'll turn to whoever promises a solution.
Or whatever.
Ollie, please, back me up here? I wish I could.
As a species, we're fundamentally insane.
Put more than two of us in a room, we pick sides and start dreaming up reasons to kill one another.
Why'd you think we invented politics and religion?
Oh, Jesus, that's just wrong.
Look, nobody has to decide anything now, okay?
First things first, the pharmacy.
That'll be our test run.
Okay?
It's all right, Big Bill. I'll bring you back some comic books.
I don't want them.
I want you to stay here.
I won't be gone long.
It's just next door.
You'll be safe.
Daddy, Daddy, there are things out there.
Things...
Yeah. There's a lot less of them in the daytime.
They'll wait. They'll wait in the mist where you can't see them,
and then when you go and can't get back in,
they'll come and eat you up! Shh.
Daddy, don't go!
I'll be back.
Big Bill, I promise.
I'll be back and then I'm gonna take you home.
All right?
Together, we're going home.
If something happens, anything at all, you cut and run.
You get your ass back in here, for your boy's sake.
If something happens to me, I want you to take care of Billy as best as you can,
I want you to take care of Billy as best as you can, as long as you can.
The Land Cruiser is yours now. You get him out of here, you just keep driving.
You get him out of here, you just keep driving.
Where do you think you're going, Mr. David Drayton?
Are you so anxious to make your boy an orphan?
My boy is no concern of yours.
Listen up.
We're going to the pharmacy. We're gonna bring back some supplies.
Also, there may be people trapped over there who need help.
Folks, listen!
We're not gonna take any chances.
If there's any trouble,
we'll come straight back here to the supermarket.
And bring the fiends of hell down on our heads, thank you.
She's right.
You'll make them notice us. You'll make them come.
Why can't you just leave well enough alone?
Lady, is this what you call well enough?
If you want to stop us,
you better explain to Bobby here why we're not bringing painkillers and medicine back for his brother.
[Bobby] No, I'm going. Even if I have to go alone.
You'll die out there, young man.
You'll walk out that door and be torn to shreds,
and then your hell-bound pride will have them come get the rest of us.
Yes, they'll come back for all of us, just like this good lady said.
Do you want that to happen, people?
No! No, no, no!
Well, it is this kind of hubris
that brought the wrath of God in the first place.
This kind of pride and defiance of the...
Shut up, you miserable buzzard!
You old bitch! No, no, no, no, no!
Stoning people who piss you off is perfectly okay.
They do it in the Bible, don't they? And I got lots of peas.
David, please, if you want to go, now's the time.
How bout it, Army?
Any help from the armed forces?
I'll go.
Jim Grondin.
I had you in school, didn't I? Yes, me and my sister Pauline.
A pair of underachievers.
After you, Jim.
Yes, ma'am. Shit.
Is that it? That's everybody?
Everybody that's going?
Yes. Okay.
Single file, one by one, all right?
Let's get this thing over with.
Let's go. After you.
Yes.
Stay together.
Mrs. Carmody, you're not helping. I don't care.
Shut the hell up! You shut up!
Save the batteries.
[David] Shit.
They left the doors propped open.
[Ollie] Think something got in?
[David] Let's just get what we need, get the hell outta here.
[Ollie] Yeah, let's do that.
[Irene] The meds are over at the end there, in the cubicle.
[David] Will you not do that?
[Jim] I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
God.
Where's that Silvadene?
It's over behind David.
In the fridge, check there.
[David] Silvadene, got it.
Good. [David] Ollie, what are we looking for?
Penicillin. Yeah.
Any strong antibiotics.
Pain meds, Vicodin, or Oxycontin.
Oxycontin.
Hydrochloride?
Penicillin.
[David] Guys...
[Dan] Hurry it up, I hear something.
What?
Something fuckin' weird.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
No. Oh, no.
Oh, no! Aw, fuck!
Look, there's another one.
Oh my God. No, no, no.
Oh, no, no!
Guys, let's get out of here, now.
Holy shit!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Help me!
Help me!
Son of a bitch!
This stuff ain't coming off.
Aw, man. [Jessup] He's glued to this fuckin' post. Hang in there.
It's our fault.
It's all our fault.
It's really stuck.
[M.P.] I can feel them.
I can feel them.
Jesus.
Oh my God.
There's more!
[Jim] There's another one! Hit it!
[Dan] Ollie, Ollie! One over there. Ollie, Ollie, there.
Ollie, Ollie, there.
There, there.
[Jim] Shoot, shoot!
[Ollie] Shit.
Where the hell are they?
Bobby!
Bobby, hold on! Hold on!
Hold on! Cut the strand!
Help me!
[David] A belt! Who's got a belt? [Mike] I've got a belt!
[Mike] I got him, I got him. [David] Hold on!
Light.
Light!
[David] Come on, come on!
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
Watch it, watch it!
[Ollie] All right, go, go, go, go, go, go! Come on!
Come on!
Ollie! Ollie!
[Jim] Kill it, kill it!
Fuckers.
[Jessup] Oh, no. God, he's dead, he's dead!
Get outta here! Come on, let's go, let's go!
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, Drayton, he's dead!
Come on!
Open the door!
-[yelling] -Where's Bobby?
Daddy!
[Bud] Come on, come on, hurry up!
What happened?
[Jim] They're dead! They're all dead!
[Mrs. Carmody] Expiation, because we have seen
that the earth is scourged with whips and scorpions.
We have seen the earth vomit forth from her lips
obscenities and profanities of such nightmare proportions.
And for these evil, lurking spirits
and all these evil people with greed-
How long was I out?
Most of the day.
You just came over here, lied down, and went to sleep.
Just passed out is more like it.
I just shut down for a while.
I'm sorry.
[Mrs. Carmody] Expiation!
Expiation! Do you remember yesterday-
How's Joe?
Dead. Joe died of his burns while you were asleep.
We were just too late.
[Mrs. Carmody] I told you thi was-
God, I thought I was dreaming her voice.
No dream.
She's getting people whipped up.
That poor girl is dead. And that boy is burnt in the backroom.
She's got them believing she's a psychic. She has a direct line to God. Why wouldn't they?
Why wouldn't they? Woman never shuts up.
Like those speeches Castro used to make.
Ollie says you're thinking of leaving.
I'm in.
No, sorry.
I mean, come on, you saw what happened to Bobby, Mike.
I won't do that again, I won't be responsible.
You might want to reconsider that.
[Mrs. Carmody] What will keep these evil, these abominations at bay?
What will keep them away?
"The rock will not hide them, the dead tree give no shelter"
What will end it, let me hear it? Expiation!
What are we talking about?
Expiation! Good, say it again like you mean it.
Expiation!
Welcome to Sesame Street. Today's word is "expiation".
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
That boy hasn't been right since the pharmacy.
His mind's just snapped, gone.
Hasn't even been two days.
Not even two days.
I'm not spending the rest of my life here, I tell you what.
I can quietly gather up some bags of groceries and hide them up at one of the check stands by the door.
[Dan] It was your idea, it's your vehicle,
it'll be your call.
I'd rather die out there trying than in here waiting.
Who will save them? No one.
The rock will not.
I want some idea of what we're up against.
I want to know what this mist is.
I want to talk to the soldiers. Soldiers? What's that gonna do?
You heard what the MP said at the pharmacy.
David, I'm not even sure I knew he was talking. The situation was insane.
He said he was sorry, wasn't that the word he used?
He said he was sorry, wasn't that the word he used? Sorry?
That's right, he said it was their fault, right?
What did he mean by that?
That's what we're gonna find out.
Irene, stay with Billy, please.
Verse 17! "Poured out his vial into the air, and there came a great voice
out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying,
it is done, it is done!
And there were voices, and lighting, and thunders, and a great earthquake, yet as we've not seen."
Yes, come to me!
What?
Where's your friends? I ain't seen 'em.
Not that big a store, it's kinda hard to lose.
I ain't seen 'em, I said. Do I look like their keeper?
What do you want from me? What do you know about this mist?
I don't know nothin', I got nothin' to do with it.
That's what the MP said in the pharmacy before the spiders came out of his skin.
They're not in the store.
The only place we haven't looked is the loading dock.
Because you know, you saw the good face of God tonight.
Yes? Tell us.
Here's an old man who has seen, yes, he has seen!
And I want to save you, I want to walk with you
into my father's hands.
Morales.
Donaldson.
Guys?
It's the only place they can be.
[Jessup] What? [Ollie] Couldn't just disappear.
[Jessup] Look, I told you, okay? I don't know where they are and I don't...
I didn't think they'd do it.
They said they would do it, and I told them what the MP said at the pharmacy,
and I told them what the MP said at the pharmacy,
and they swore they'd do it, I just didn't think they would.
Oh, Jesus.
It's the Arrowhead Project, isn't it?
This mist. It's some kind of what, military fuck up?
What were you guys messing with up there, huh? We got you now, you sorry son of a bitch!
Get in there!
It was them! It was them what done it to us!
It was them what brung down the final wrath upon us!
Those two peckerwoods that he's been with this whole time, they hung themselves in the back because they knew,
they knew it all along.
No, he's crazy. He doesn't know what he's- Get on your knees!
Stay out of it, Drayton.
They heard it too, didn't ya? All of ya!
All about the Arrowhead Project and all that secret shit up on the mountain.
That's what brung it down on us. That's what brung down the wrath of God.
Private Jessup.
It wasn't me. I'm stationed out there, I'm not responsible.
I'm stationed out there, I'm not responsible.
Bullshit. Hell, I'm a local!
Most of you people know me.
You! Stop your chicken shit whining,
or I will cut your puling tongue out.
Now you tell us!
Tell us.
Look, look, okay, okay.
I heard stuff.
"Stuff".
Yes, we all heard stuff.
Like, how they thought that there were other dimensions.
Other worlds all around us,
and how they wanted to try and make a window.
You know, so they could look through and see what's on the other side.
Well, maybe your window turned out to be a door, didn't it?
Not mine, those scientists!
Oh, the scientists. Yes, the scientists, it wasn't me.
They must've ripped a hole open by accident, this other world came spilling through to ours.
That's what Donaldson was saying to me right before he killed himself,
I didn't understand the half of it.
It ain't my fault!
Ain't his fault.
No, no, no.
Ain't nothing ever anybody's fault.
But he denies it.
He points the finger.
This Judas in our midst.
Judas!
David!
You, you!
Don't you know by now?
Don't you know the truth?
We are being punished.
For what? For going against the will of God?
For going against his forbidden rules of old.
Walking on the moon.
Yes, yes!
Or splitting his atoms.
Or stem cells and abortions!
And destroying the secrets of life
that only God above has any right to!
Amen! Amen!
Yes, I know. It is true!
And now we are being punished,
the judgment is being brought down upon us.
The fiends of hell, you see they are let loose.
And star Wormwood blazes.
And it is his fault, yes his-
No, no! It is not my fault!
They did it! They spit in the eye of the almighty!
No!
Get over there!
No! Judas!
String him up!
[Man] Stand up, you coward!
Jesus!
No! Stop him!
Feed him to the beast!
Expiation!
Let the abominations smell his blood!
No!
Jesus, wait! David!
Please.
The beast will leave us alone tonight.
Tomorrow...
Tomorrow we'll just have to wait and see.
[Billy] Daddy?
Daddy?
I'm sorry I left you, pal.
I won't ever leave you again.
Promise?
You have to give me your best promise, okay?
Your very best promise. You can never break it.
Tell me.
Promise you won't let the monsters get me.
Ever, no matter what.
I promise.
I love you, Daddy.
I love you, Billy.
More than anything.
It's dawn.
Hey, pal.
You ready to go home?
Come on.
Okay. I've got the groceries hidden at check stand number 2.
Five bags, we can grab 'em and get out the door.
Okay.
My car's parked in the center lane of the parking lot, far end.
Whoever gets there first open up both doors, and we'll all pile in as fast as we can, okay?
Let's go.
Stealing food now?
Going out now, Mrs. Carmody.
Please stand aside.
You can't go out, I won't allow it.
Won't allow it?
It's against God's will.
Don't you know that by now?
Haven't I proven myself again and again and again?
Haven't I shown that I am his vessel?
What's the matter with you?
Don't you believe in God?
No one's interfered with you,
all we're asking for is the same privilege.
You heard him.
It is these people who brought this upon us.
They, people who refuse to bend to the will of God
and claim it privilege.
Sinners in pride.
Yes, haughty.
Privileged!
They mock us, they mock our god, our faith, our values,
They mock us, they mock our god, our faith, our values, our very lifestyle.
They mock our humility and our piousness.
They piss on us and laugh.
It's from them the blood of human sacrifice must come.
From them.
The blood of expiation.
You try it.
You fuckin' try it!
Come on.
We want the boy.
You get back! We want the boy!
You get back!
Grab that boy! Grab him!
Grab him!
And get the whore too!
Grab her!
Kill them! Kill them all!
Stay down, stay down, stay down.
I killed her.
Thank you, Ollie.
Let's go.
Get that ice machine out of the way, please.
You- Come on. Killed her!
You murdered her!
I wouldn't of shot her, Dave. Not if there had been any other way.
That's why I said thank you.
Okay.
Okay, then.
Let's go!
Get up, Myron!
Come on, we gotta go! My ankle!
All the way down!
Where are they?
Bud, Myron?
Ambrose! I think I broke it!
Fuck Come on, come on, come on!
We gotta go, come on, come on!
They're lost!
Oh, Jesus. Ollie!
Ollie!
All that screaming.
Are they out there, can they see us?
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!
Are we going?
No.
-No, no, no. -Yeah, yeah.
David.
-David, no. -Daddy, no.
-David! -Daddy!
[Amanda] Get back in the car!
[Billy] Daddy! [Amanda] David!
Oh my God!
Oh my God.
We gotta go.
I told her I'd fix it.
Front window, broken open.
Tree.
My grandfather's tree.
I'm sorry, David, I'm just so sorry.
Let's...
See how far this fuel takes us, huh?
Maybe we'll get clear of this mist.
Well...
We gave it a good shot.
Nobody could say we didn't.
Nope.
Nobody can say that.
[David] Well... we've got...
Four.
Four bullets.
But there's five of us.
I'll figure something out.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on.
I couldn't keep my eyes away.
When I was little, my mom took me to watch a jam session in the neighborhood.
It started out small, but word spread.
Soon, some of the best dancers around were showing up
to compete in something they eventually called, "The Streets."
It became the hub, and I got a front-row seat to history.
I wanted to glide and spin and fly like they did.
But it didn't come easy.
My mom would tell me,
"Don't give up, just be you, 'cause life's too short to be anybody else."
And she was right.
When I was 16, my mom got sick.
Within a couple of months, she was gone.
And everything changed,
including The Streets.
Stop it! Stop it!
Somebody help! Get off! Don't...
Suspects jammed it.
[girl] Go! Yeah!
They're going up the stairs. Sir, are you okay?
[man] Hey, buddy.
Run faster!
[Felicia] Yo, the 410 killed it again, man.
That was sick, son.
[Andie] Thank you very much. I'm a genius.
If you do say so yourself.
Girl, get out of here.
Get that mask off.
[Felicia] Yo, we're gonna get some serious YouTube plays, son.
Come on, let's go. We gotta get to the spot before everybody gets there.
Oh, man, we struck gold with this.
Look at that, D.
This is off the chain.
Boards are gonna go crazy over this one.
Yo, let's upload this stat. Not it. Not it.
Aye. Why it gotta be me?
'Cause you're the youngest.
And, obviously, the slowest.
Girl, stop slinging that Spanish at me, Telemundo.
Gotcha!
Oh! Jesus, Tuck!
Oh, man, wish you could see the look on your faces.
Can the jokes, son.
So what did you guys think?
On the real? [clicks tongue]
We killed that!
Oh, yes! Lucky, lucky!
Streets ain't gonna be ready for us this year.
[Missy] Finally.
Let me see that. Let me see that.
Give us my camera back. Give me! Go, go, go!
So what's up? We going out tonight?
I don't know. It's just...
It's been a crazy time, you know, at home with Sarah and all.
Yeah, I heard that before.
Yo, Tuck! Come on, man, we bouncing.
We gotta go. You're always lagging.
[Tuck] All right. I'll see you at rehearsal.
Okay.
[reporter] This video, posted on the Internet just hours ago was taken earlier today.
It depicts the most recent in a wave of public disturbances
plaguing the streets of Baltimore.
The notoriously elusive 410
has claimed responsibility for this morning's attack
that both defaced public property
and shut down the Charles Center Station over security concerns.
Police have been tracking this troubling trend,
and sources close to the investigation...
Not so fast, Andie. Get in here. Andie! [laughs]
We've got to talk.
I can't believe you.
Dinner was an hour ago.
Sorry, Sarah, the bus was late. I'm here, aren't I? So just chill out.
Baby, you go on upstairs and go to bed.
[Charlie] Okay.
I know where you've been.
It's all over the news.
So don't stand here and lie to my face. Do you realize you could have been arrested?
It wasn't a big deal. You have no idea what you're talking about.
You've got to take responsibility for your life, Andie.
You can't follow the 410 forever.
Those people are criminals.
I'm putting my foot down.
This has got to stop. Now.
No!
No, the 410 is the only family I have left.
And who are you to tell me how to live my life?
Your mother was my best friend!
I told her that I would be your guardian.
I promised her that I would take care of you,
so you wouldn't have to leave your life here.
But you won't let me.
Instead, you skip school. You're out all night.
God only knows what you're doing.
I can't do this.
Your Aunt Alice and I have been talking.
You can't live here anymore.
You're sending me to Texas?
Like I haven't lost enough already? You can't do this to me!
Your mother never would've let you get away with half the things I have.
No, you have no idea what my mother would have done.
Felicia, where are you? I don't know what to do. I'm going crazy.
I'm done with her. Please, I need a place to crash.
I'm not staying there anymore. Okay, call me. I'm heading to the Dragon.
What's poppin'? I'm the man, DJ Sand.
Tonight, it's all about the Benjamins, baby.
We taking it to The Streets for green.
You got money? No, you don't. Come on! We gonna get it started.
Brand-new music. Listen to this one.
Yo, Meazy. What's going on?
Yo, D.
What it is? How are ya?
You out to do some damage tonight?
You want to take my bag?
Yes, yes, got it, got it.
It's crazy out there. I know. It is.
About to do your thing? Oh, I will. You know.
Go school them fools. ♪ I'll have you in da ♪
Look who's all grown-up now. Ty, what are you doing? Oh, my God.
What's up, little one? Oh. I thought you were in New York with Nora.
Oh, I am. I am. I came back to get the rest of my stuff.
Guess what. What?
Me and Nora are going on tour. What? Oh, that is unreal.
You better remember me when you get all famous and stuff.
Are you kidding me? Come on!
I remember you when you were running around the neighborhood in diapers.
You were a pain in my ass.
That's really embarrassing.
Seriously, what's going on with you and Sarah?
She called you. No, she didn't call me.
I came by to see you, and she told me you took off.
She's flipping out.
Did she tell you she's sending me away, too?
She don't know what else to do with you.
She's trying to look out for you,
just like your mom and everyone else on the block looked out for me.
So, you're siding with her?
No, I'm not.
You know, I don't even need to explain this. I'm out. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on. Look, chill out.
If you stop being so stubborn,
maybe you'll realize there are some less dramatic options.
Really, like what?
MSA. [scoffs] Okay.
Maryland School of the Arts. Yeah, I know what it is.
Are you crazy? Do I look like some princess prima ballerina?
Andie, what other options do you have?
Hmm?
Let me break it down for you.
Sarah will give you one more shot.
But MSA's no joke.
Okay? You gotta go to class. You can't skip school, you got to study.
No chance, no way.
Okay, fine, I'll battle you for it. Right now.
Look, you win, I never saw you here tonight.
I win, you get your ass back home and you're at MSA first thing in the morning.
Okay, look. If you're scared, just say you're scared.
I wouldn't want to battle me if I was a girl.
No smile?
What, you scared?
You down?
[DJ Sand] Hold it, hold it. Hold up, hold it.
We got royalty in the house. Tyler Gage is in the building.
[crowd cheering] Oh, man.
You know we gotta do something special, right?
Clear the dance floor. Clear it.
Back up! Back up! Back up!
Ladies and gentlemen, here we go.
Brand-new music, y'all.
Oh, man, are those trampolines?
Use 'em or lose 'em.
Here we go.
Cool, y'all.
Hey, you want to get this?
And break my neck?
Nah, I got it.
[DJ Sand] Is she talking crazy? You still dance like a little girl?
I was tryin' to enjoy my night but you then came here - ♪ Turned around the vibe... ♪ -No, no.
♪ You got to go... ♪ [DJ Sand] Let her know what's good, Tyler.
Watch out, ladies!
[Tyler] Come on, I want to show you.
He's killing it!
Andie's got feels, Tyler.
Come on! Whoo!
She just punched it on you. What you gonna do?
Oh, did she stick you?
She stuck it on you.
That's just rocking!
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Nah! Come on!
He's not...
Oh, no!
He's coming out his clothes!
It's over. It's over.
That's what I'm talking about.
Come on, y'all.
It's all good, Andie. Next time, baby.
It's all right. You're good, ma.
Oh. You okay?
Hey. Don't sweat it. Everybody's just hatin' on you, 'cause you're dope.
Is you running off again?
No. No?
You know I'm just trying to look out for you, right?
Yeah, whatever.
[mockingly] Yeah, whatever.
Don't give me "whatever."
Let's get you out of here. I've got to get you home, plus we've still got to sell Sarah on the idea.
I thought she agreed.
[chuckles] Just let me do the talking. Come on.
[Sarah] No. I'm sending her to Texas, and that's final.
She's already on probation at school.
[Tyler] This is the one shot she needs to take all that anger she's got
and be able to put it into a structure.
She's not going to school now.
What makes you think that she's gonna go to this school?
Piece of cake.
No way. [chuckles]
That's the thanks I get for saving your little ass?
Wait, she's down?
Believe it or not, she thinks I set a good example for you, so...
What? I don't know.
My work here is done.
I'm going home.
Now, all you have to do is get in.
Hold up. I thought you said you took care of everything.
I didn't say I'd get you in. I said I'd get you an audition.
So, go show 'em what you got, all right?
Go hard, all right? Make me proud.
Promise? Promise.
Okay.
Stay out of trouble, all right?
Holy hell. You know what? I cannot believe you're about to do this.
Well, it is this or Texas, so... take your pick.
Don't blow it. No pressure or anything, girl.
Wait a minute.
[boy] Check that out.
It can't be that bad, going here.
[boy] She's hot.
Missy, shut up.
What? Just stop talking.
I guess.
Look, go in there and kill it.
We'll see you at rehearsal afterwards. All right?
Come on, Missy. [Missy] Good luck, D. Later.
He was cute though, girl. You're just mad, 'cause he wasn't looking at you.
[Felicia] Girl, he wasn't looking at you or your chapped lips...
Boring. It's a bunch of clones.
Just because they do turns with their feet and not on their heads?
Very funny. Wake me up when they're all done.
I think we'd all agree that talent comes from mastering technique.
I was brought here because I can turn amateurs into professionals.
Nailed it.
Music, please.
Thank you.
[woman] Do you have your paperwork?
Yep.
Hi. Hi.
[man] Thank you, Miss, uh... West.
[Blake] Well, she was different. Are you kidding me? That was the best dance we've seen today.
The girl's amazing.
She's just a street dancer.
Blake, I thought you could turn anyone into a professional.
So what happened?
You guys, I choked.
What do you mean?
[cell phone ringing] I tried to get it back, but I just freaked out.
Sarah gonna have her ass down in Texas before we know it.
Hello?
Yo, who you talking to?
[Felicia] Oh, here he comes.
I'm sorry. I gotta take this real quick.
Man, what y'all doing?
Come on.
[Missy] How'd she mess up?
Yo, Rap.
Looks like I'm staying.
Oh! Word? Thank goodness, girl.
Yo, cut the music.
Yo, we need a family meeting.
Yo, we got this gig at the Dragon coming up, and we're not even close to being ready for it.
The 410 is a unit.
We're only as strong as our weakest link.
And with the way our new members are slacking, we're gonna have to step it up.
Which means rehearsal every day, 4:00 p.m.
No excuses, no being late, and no cell phones.
Are we clear?
[Missy] Crystal. [Felicia] We're clear.
You're in my seat.
[chuckles] I'm kidding.
I mean, this is my seat, but I'll give you a pass for today.
Nice. Nice. Nice shirt, Napoleon Dynamite. Nice.
You look fantastic today, by the way.
Nice hair.
What's up?
I'm Robert Alexander III. But you can call me Moose.
What's up? I'm Andie.
Oh, no, no. It's like this. Do it again.
We got to blow it up.
Blow it up. Ready? Blow it up.
Pull it back like that. Aye!
It's mine, so...
You're not eating? You call this food?
Tofu dogs are both nutritious and delicious.
This is good.
What?
You've got crap on your face.
Oh. I knew we could help each other out. Oh, what makes you think that I need help?
[mocking] What makes you think I need...
Trust me. I have what you need. I have the inside on everything.
Who's dating, who's hating. And who's hooking up.
What's up, Dan? What's up, Gator?
Who's that? See you guys later.
That's the music room.
This is the art room where some of the greatest Baltimore artists...
[girl] I'm dead serious.
Oh! You okay?
Hey.
Thank you.
We gotta stop meeting like this, you know.
It's Andie, right?
I'm Chase. Welcome to MSA. I'm glad you made it in.
Well, here I am. You're an amazing little dancer. You know that?
What? I said, you're an amazing little dancer.
Little? Really?
Well, you know, I wouldn't call my dancing "little."
Okay, I definitely was not trying to say... [Moose] Andie!
Where have you been? I've been looking for you.
Chase. Hey.
[Moose] How you doing?
Great. So, you guys are friends?
Oh, yeah, we go way back.
Good.
We're actually late for a little something, so...
We are?
Yeah. What?
Remember? That thing you told me? I didn't tell you anything.
Yes, you did. We're gonna go.
Remember that thing?
What? That thing you wanted to do?
What are you talking about?
I can't believe you know Chase Collins.
That's extremely vital information to withhold.
I don't know him.
He's Mr. Popular. Like a legacy.
His parents, like, founded this school. And his brother is legendary.
Dr. Collins is his brother?
Yeah.
He used to go here, then moved to London to dance with the Royal Ballet.
[Andie] Oh, my God. That's him?
Yeah. It's hard to believe, right, with all those feathers.
So why'd he come back?
Good question.
Sources say he has some sweet deal to make MSA the next Juilliard.
Which he's been trying to do. Maybe he's just burned out.
But one thing's for sure. There's a lot of changes going down that nobody likes.
Here.
Anyway, the Collins are like flippin' MSA royalty.
Chase, he's a ladies' man.
So he's a player?
Like an all-star.
He's only recently taken the jersey out of retirement.
So be warned.
Oh, and that's Cyborg Sophie.
She's an MSA machine and Collins' crowning achievement.
She's a triple threat. She acts, sings and dances.
She won every competition out there.
But she just lost the biggest battle of them all,
the one for Chase's heart.
It's like I've landed in an episode of The Hills.
He broke up with her a few weeks ago, but they'll end up back together and live happily ever after.
Just in time for the season finale, huh?
See? I knew you'd come around.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Director Collins. I hope you've all stretched this morning,
'cause we have a lot of work to do today.
I'm sure that everyone has heard of our plans
to move MSA into a new state-of-the-art facility.
Well, to encourage the donors, we're throwing a fundraiser,
where you will perform to demonstrate what a good investment you are.
It should be a wonderful event.
And, yes, you are all required to participate in one way or another.
So, let's begin with some improv, shall we?
Jimmy, you're up.
You're late. Not being on time won't fly in the real world.
Come on. Already with that stuff, Blake?
That's Director Collins.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Chase, show us what you got.
Good, not great. Could do better.
Okay. Andie, you're up.
Are you serious?
Listen and interpret. ♪ Ooh, I like you ♪
Andie. Andie!
You're all over the place.
Again, from the top, listen and interpret.
Okay... Stop. Stop! Can I have a word with you in private?
And bring your bags.
Do you understand you've been given an opportunity that others couldn't even dream of?
I put my name on the line for you, and now I'm beginning to wonder if I made a mistake.
You clearly have some catching up to do.
Starting tomorrow, I'm assigning you to attend after-school sessions with me.
Well, I can't. I gotta be somewhere.
Consider this an opportunity.
What?
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine...
Just breathe. First day's always the worst.
I was just... That's okay.
I come out front and meditate sometimes, too.
What? It's not meditating.
It's just... You had some pretty serious balls today in class.
I was impressed.
Oh, gee, thanks.
You're welcome.
So what's your deal? Boy bands making a comeback?
Yeah. They have a course on it here.
I'm getting straight A's.
That wouldn't surprise me.
Look, um, it's been interesting bonding with you, but I'm late.
Late for what?
Just this rehearsal thing.
Rehearsal for what?
Just rehearsal with some friends.
Like a crew? What would you know about that?
Knew it. Saw you at the Dragon. You're with 410.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've wanted to compete there, I've just never had an in. Can you hook me up?
Hey, Chase, we're working on the routine for the fundraiser.
Are you coming? [Chase] Yeah, I'll be right there.
Sophie, I'll meet you in the rehearsal.
Okay.
Look...
The Streets is about where you're from. It's not some school talent show.
There's no spring floors. There's no spotlights.
You use what you got and...
What makes you think you got it, huh?
Weren't you late for something, Andie?
Bye, Andie West.
[Hip Hop music playing] Five, six, seven, eight.
Again. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four.
Whoa, wait, oh, wait.
You used to do that part different. Can you do that from "three, four" again, please?
Let me go figure this out. Y'all just chill here for a second.
Where have you been at, man? I've been texting you all day.
I know, I'm sorry.
This school thing is crazy. Will you cover for me with Tuck?
Don't I always cover for you? Yes.
Yo, D, let me holler at you.
Yo, where you been?
I just had to take care of some stuff.
Oh, yeah, with who?
Charlie.
Sarah asked me to take care of him while she was at work.
You still coming over tonight or what?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna take care of stuff, and I'll be there.
All right.
Yo! Start it from the beginning.
Okay, now, point your toe.
You see, you're sickling.
There should be no curve disrupting the line from the knee all the way down to the tip of your toe.
Ow! Ow! There you go. That's it.
There. That's it. Ow.
Pointing hurts. Yeah, it's supposed to.
Pull in your stomach.
Flat, flat, flat.
Now, tuck your butt.
Keep this leg turned out.
Turned out. Turned out!
Oh, my God.
Balance, balance.
Chasse, pas de bourree.
Turn, turn, down, finish.
Turn, turn, spot, spot!
Ready, and feet in front, feet back, feet front, feet back. Come on.
And back, and back, and back, and back, and back,
and back, and back, and back, and back,
and back...
Good! That's it.
Andie? There's dinner down here.
Yo, where D at?
Uh, she just left me a message.
Sarah got her on lockdown again.
Guess she's missing out... again.
Guess so.
[Moose] And then, I was like, "Damn, your breath stinks, girl!"
[Andie] Why would you say that to her?
'Cause I thought it would be cool.
Well, it wasn't.
It's my mom.
Oh, my gosh.
What? That is not your ringtone.
Why? It's the coolest thing ever.
Okay, fine. Listen.
Here we go. Watch me, watch me, watch.
[Andie] I don't even know him.
You were so sick. I had no idea you could dance.
It's whatever. What are you talking about?
Why don't you dance here?
I can freestyle all right. Right? But I didn't get in here for dance.
I mean, I didn't think I could do choreography.
Now I'm all about lighting design.
The end's not working.
Mixing those moves just feels wrong.
Come on, man.
Let me show you something.
If you put this here into a canon, and then swing through to fifth,
then bring it down.
Step, step, stag.
Soutenu, double tour to the knee.
Nice, Jimmy.
Looks like someone's in a good mood.
Must be hard living in the shadow of a legend, huh?
Wow, that coming from the MSA charity case?
I was just kidding.
You're right, he's an ass. I'm out of here.
Look, I never called you an ass.
She just said that for dramatic effect.
If you're trying to win her over,
you probably shouldn't treat her like that.
I'm not trying to win her over.
Then don't lead her on.
Andie.
Hey. What's going on?
I wanted to apologize for earlier today. It wasn't anything personal.
I had a really rough day and I was joking.
Oh, please.
It's not like I sit up at night and think about
what you do or don't say to me, but thanks.
I feel better now. Let me give you a ride. Make it up to you.
I can just... I have to take the bus.
No, come on. My car's gotta smell better than the bus.
♪ Figured Adam had a weak spot and she was right ♪ [Missy] There she is. [Felicia] She really come when we're done. Huh?
She missed the whole rehearsal. Whatever.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Miss Thing Girl. Where you been at?
What's the deal?
Thank you for finally gracing us with your presence.
Rehearsal's done.
Hey, hey, come on. I got here as soon as I could.
You know what's been going on lately.
No, I don't. I'll tell you what's been going on.
Everybody's been asking, "Have you talked to D? "Where's D at? Have you heard from her?"
And I'm here looking like an ass making stuff up for you,
so you can go dance around your fancy new school.
What is your problem?
Yo. What's going on here? Nothing.
Ask her. What was that?
I said, "Ask her."
D, you got to tell me something?
Yeah, the reason I've been late
and haven't been around much is because...
I've been going to school at MSA.
So you've been lying to me and the crew for what? Those ballet boys?
You guys don't understand. I don't have a choice. No, that's messed up, D.
We're family.
I thought you said you understood that.
The 410 don't come second to nobody.
You out.
No, please, Tuck, come on.
It's just been a crazy time.
It's always been a crazy time with you.
Yo, let's go.
Oh! Hey, watch yourself, huh?
God...
Morning, sunshine.
The good times just keep on coming, don't they?
Ouch.
What got into you today?
What? As opposed to my winning charm every other day?
Fair enough. Two points to the new girl.
You want to talk about it?
I got kicked out of my crew.
What for?
For being here.
You know, I can't believe I messed this up. I think they messed up.
They lost an amazing dancer.
You should just start your own crew.
No, you can't just start your own crew.
Why not? Because you can't.
Besides, who would be in it? Me and...
Me.
Us. Okay. We'll just start our own crew.
What else you gonna do?
No. Nobody here is gonna step out of their perfect little world.
Maybe not the Sophie Donovans, but there's a lot going on here under the radar.
Really?
[Chase] There's this guy we call Hair.
He's this half hippy, half rhythmic rebel,
and he makes the sickest beats you've ever heard.
Teachers don't know what to do with him.
You can't put him in a class, because he just gets bored, and starts making up his own steps.
There's Kido. She's this foreign exchange student obsessed with old-school American hip hop.
And, trust me, she doesn't need to know English to speak our language.
Fly's the quiet one, but not when the music's on.
She's too tall to partner, but when you're that good, who needs a partner?
Which brings us to Monster, our resident stunt double. He flips, he slides, he falls.
Whatever you need to make an action sequence work onstage.
But he never gets the spotlight.
Most know my boy, Cable, as the video yearbook editor.
But little do they know,
he's one of the best freestyle dancers I've ever seen in my life.
And, finally, Smiles. Nicest guy you'll ever meet.
Dopest dancer on the dance floor.
Unfortunately, MSA only sees what it wants to see.
[Andie] Don't forget Moose.
[Chase] Moose?
Yeah, trust me on this one.
Come on!
[Andie] But what makes you think they'll do it?
[Chase] They all have nothing to lose.
No!
You guys, listen up. Check it out.
Now, I know each and every one of you here
knows what it's like to be forced to conform and become an MSA robot, right?
Yeah, they wanted me to cut my hair.
Yeah, and fix my teeth.
I like your teeth.
Thank you. I like your accent.
What kind of accent?
The accent you have. You have an accent.
I have no accent. It's really strong.
[Chase] That's exactly my point.
And I also know that each one of you guys
has a really amazing talent that this school doesn't know what to do with.
So, I think it's time we do something with that talent.
Like what? Like form a crew and compete at The Streets.
[all] No, no!
I heard it's dangerous.
Forget about what you heard.
The Streets is about the best dance crew showing off what they got.
We don't stand a chance.
What are you talking about?
Freddie, I've seen you do your stunts in the school play.
There's a reason they call you Monster. Yeah, like this?
[laughs] That was hot.
And, Kido, you went crazy at the showcase after-party last year.
Oh, that was fun.
Hey, hey. Get it, get it. Hey, hey, hey.
Get it. Get it, Kido. She won't... She won't stop.
She won't stop, she won't. You need to stop.
So when is it?
That's the thing.
Nobody knows when or where until a text message of the night of.
So we have got to be ready.
Sounds good, but, Director Collins would never let us rehearse here.
[Smiles] True. No way. Who said Director Collins has to know?
[Smiles] Wow. [Kido] He's got the keys.
Borrowed and copied.
MSA after hours. I like it.
Yeah!
What do you say we go and check out our competition?
[DJ Sand] Oh man! Put your hands together.
Ow! Put your hands up!
Hey, yo, Leesh. Leesh, look, look, look, look. Andie's here.
Where? Right there.
She shouldn't be.
Yo, what you doing here, man?
Oh, please don't tell me that's your new crew.
No. Yeah, we're her crew.
We're getting ready to battle at The Streets.
What street, Sesame Street?
[laughter] What do you know about The Streets? Why don't you guys back off, all right?
We're just here to check a few things out.
So, this is how you've been wasting your time, with these losers? Huh?
Listen, buddy. Why don't you just go do your thing? We're just gonna be over here doing ours.
Oh, you got a thing that you do?
Why don't you show us, then, homeboy?
All right, let's go.
Yeah, let's go.
Hey, yo, DJ Sand!
Drop that beat, homey.
Looks like we've got new fish in town.
Let's clear the dance floor.
We gonna see what they talking about.
Now, you come into my house, you recognize what's going on.
Don't step in that circle if you ain't got it.
What's up, bro? I don't know you!
I don't know when to start. Five. Start on five when I start.
[DJ Sand] The music's playing already. Dance to the music.
That's not how we do it here.
This ain't High School Musical.
That's how you dance? Your mama taught you that? We don't dance like that.
That's what you learned at your special school?
Boo! Quit it!
[DJ Sand] That's atrocious.
[turns off music] That's it. No more. No more.
What in the hell was that?
That's how you dance?
I'll tell you what. We gonna show you how we really get down.
Y'all pick up a key chain on the way out.
Tell your mama not to be late picking you up from work.
[man] You guys are garbage!
All right, man. Well, let's get it. 410, can we get it started?
Let's get it started. Here we go.
[DJ Sand] That's what I'm talkin' about!
Aren't they entertaining?
[DJ Sand] That's how we do it.
You can't learn that in school!
Let's just regroup tomorrow.
Come on.
[Chase] Guys, come on. This is one performance.
You can't let it get you that down.
[Andie] We didn't work this hard to just give up, you know.
[Smiles] We shouldn't have went out there in the first place.
We looked like idiots.
[Cable] Seriously, Chase. You know, the choreography wasn't even right for this.
Hey. Oh, it's cool. I know her.
What are you doing here?
Things got way out of hand last night. Yeah. Thanks for your support.
Look, I'm sorry.
What they did to you was wrong. But you should know that I quit.
What? Yeah.
They're all on such a power trip. I refuse.
I thought we were supposed to be about family, you know.
And it just wasn't the same without you.
But, look, I miss you.
I haven't seen you in that long.
My family's having a barbecue this Saturday.
Why don't you come through?
So that's why you came by?
Yeah.
You know, Felicia is going to trip if she knows you're here.
Felicia should be the last of your worries right now.
I swear, we're really not that bad.
Really. Come on.
Hey, you guys,
this is my girl, Missy.
She's here to, uh...
help us out.
[Smiles] Help us out?
We bombed last night.
[Cable] Yeah. Our respect went out the window. [Smiles] Sure did.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
What are y'all talking about, respect went out the window?
Like, respect is gone? You can always get it back.
So what are you all thinking for The Prank though?
[stutters] What's The Prank?
Yo, D, you ain't tell them about The Prank?
The Prank is what the crews do to show the world they're competing for The Streets.
It's a public declaration saying that you're bringing it.
The crazier it is, the better.
For proof, you gotta record it and post it online.
And then it spreads like wildfire.
Then, if you guys hit it like I know you can, y'all get your respect back.
I got an idea.
[man] Watch this, watch this!
Been runnin' that ball on him all day, son.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Yo! Why's my crib smell like Funyuns, broccoli and ball sweat?
It's your boy, Crumbs. He's been letting it loose all day.
It's the coffee, bro.
Oh, hell no. Yo, Tuck, come see this.
You gotta come see this, bro.
Relax, relax. That's my computer, man!
Man, clean this fish up!
Moose, what are you doing?
Maybe we should put you back in that grandma suit, huh?
Who's we?
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Hi, Sophie. What's up? Rehearsing for the fundraiser.
Why are you here on a Saturday?
We were gonna do the same thing, but it's locked. So...
Oh. We gotta roll, so we'll see y'all.
Where are we going?
To my house. My family's having a barbecue, remember?
Yeah, yeah, barbecue.
Why you standing there? Let's be out.
Are you going with them?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I mean, I'd say you should go, but...
But I'm not really sure it's your scene.
I'd love to.
All right.
Watch your step.
Welcome. Look at how nice it is.
Thank you.
Come down, hurry up. Y'all taking mad long.
Hey, Mom! [speaking Spanish]
How are you?
We missed you.
Everyone is eating. Come in.
Have some food. Whoa, wait.
You're coming with me.
Where are we going? You'll see.
[Andie] I can't believe I'm doing this.
What's wrong with what I had before?
Latin men like their girls to look like women, not boys.
A fact you'll appreciate when you meet my cousin.
You are not setting me up.
Alejandro's nice. Plus, he just got here.
Oh. You're pimping me out so that your cousin can get a green card?
He's from Florida.
Trust me, if he was not my cousin, you would not be standing there.
You're sick. Mm-hmm!
And I'm hungry, so are we done here?
I guess.
Ooh, Miss Thing, you got titties?
Why you trying to look better than me at my party?
Hey, cuz. Hey, mama.
How you doing? Good, and you? This is my friend, Andie.
Andie, my cousin, Alejandro. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
I'm just gonna sit down while you guys talk.
[Andie] Okay... [Alejandro] You want to dance a real dance?
I'd love to. Come on, mama.
♪ Breakfast lunch and dinner I want it all the time... ♪ Ola. May I borrow your boyfriend?
Oh, he's not my boyfriend.
It doesn't matter. It's just a dance.
Come on.
Andie, come here.
You should really wait your turn.
Ooh. I couldn't.
I didn't know you could salsa.
There's a lot you don't know about me. Which is surprising, considering how much you talk about yourself.
Come on. Let's go.
♪ When I get a taste, a taste it makes me go ♪ What's going on over here?
My goodness, Aunt Maria. It has been emotional.
I'll hit you up on MySpace sometime. Okay? Thank you. You are charming.
Oh, thank you so much.
I had a good time. Me, too. Don't tell your husband about us, now.
Bye.
[Andie] Hey.
God?
You want to fly up here and give me a hand with these lights?
Sophie, what's up, girl? Let me find out.
You got a lot of stuff going. A lot of sofrito up in you.
Oh, thank you.
You're not so bad yourself.
Um, Moose, help me with these lights.
Mom's gonna kill me. Hurry up.
Hurry up! Hold this. I'm coming.
Sophie, I'll do it, I'll do it. I'll do it.
You're welcome.
[Andie] There we go.
[Chase] This is really high.
No, it's not that bad.
Yes, it is.
No, we're good.
All right. Tree climber.
All right, this is gonna sound cheesy, but...
for what it's worth, I'm really glad you're at MSA.
I think you were doing just fine before I got there.
That's just the thing. I mean, I've been trained to dance since I first learned to walk.
But it's always been about doing it their way, and it's just not me.
But, ever since you came, I feel more like myself.
Oh, geez.
Well, I know what you mean.
My mom always used to tell me, "Just be yourself."
When I was little, that sounded strange, 'cause I was like, "How could I be anyone else?"
I bet you miss her.
Yeah.
When she got cancer, it was like the floor fell from underneath me.
I've just been running ever since.
But now I can't find my way back.
Well, maybe it's not about going back.
Maybe it's about being right where you are.
I heard you was dancing it up in there.
What, you not joking now?
Come on, guys, I'm just trying to get home.
You thought it was real funny, what you did the other day.
Tuck, it's a joke.
Look here.
Just 'cause you hang out with D, don't mean you got what it takes.
She don't know where she came from.
You don't know anything about her.
So now you defending her?
Yes, I am. I'll see you at The Streets.
At The Streets?
You in the streets now.
Unless you want some more of us, I suggest you stay away from The Streets.
And stay farther away from Andie.
Drop this fool.
Come on, get up, fool.
Get up!
Yeah. Ha.
You're not so funny now, are you, clown?
Hey, yo, Tuck.
Hey. Chase, what's going on? Hey.
Hi. Hi.
How you doing?
Is everything okay?
Yes, everything's okay. Why wouldn't everything be okay?
Oh, my God. What happened to you?
Nothing. Nothing. Don't worry. Listen, I've got to get to class.
No. That is not nothing. Who did this to you?
Just forget about it.
Let it go.
Does anybody know who is responsible for this?
This school will not be associated with these competitions.
Any future involvement by our students in The Streets will lead to expulsion.
And anyone with any information is expected to come forward.
Get this place cleaned up.
Man, I can't believe they trashed the studio.
Now we have Director Collins on our back.
That glass was all over the floor. Somebody broke the stereo, too.
[Kido] It's crazy. I don't understand.
[Cable] These guys are no joke.
[Smiles] Collins was seriously pissed.
[Moose] Man, the graffiti was everywhere.
What are we gonna do?
We could get expelled.
Yo. My parents would kill me if I got expelled.
I'd have to go to a regular school with regular kids.
Hey, guys.
This has gotten way out of hand.
I'm really sorry that I got you all into this.
Andie, don't say that.
I put everything you guys worked for at risk.
And it's not fair.
We're all in on this together.
No, it's over.
The crew's done. I don't know what we were thinking.
Andie West, Director Collins would like to see you.
By being involved in this competition, you've brought delinquent behavior into my school
and put my students at risk.
And now the studio has been vandalized.
It wasn't exactly like that.
I thought I could train you,
turn you into the dancer that you could be.
But I was wrong.
There's nothing we can do for someone who doesn't appreciate what's in front of them.
I understand.
You know, I really did try.
I'm not done.
Was there anyone else involved from this school?
No.
No one else. Just me. Then I have no choice but to expel you.
But I didn't... I'm sorry.
That's it. I'm finished. Please leave.
[Chase] Andie.
There you are. I've been looking all over for you.
What are we gonna do? It's done. Everything's done.
I think it's pretty clear
that none of this was meant to be.
Whoa, Andie. Don't do this.
Please just... Just let it go.
[Sarah] You got that? Mm-hmm.
You're my big strong boy, huh? I am your big strong boy.
Your school called.
I know I said things would be different... I know what happened. No more excuses, Andie.
I'm sick and tired of this.
You're going to your aunt's in Texas, and that's final.
It was my idea.
Your idea for what?
To compete in The Streets.
The whole thing was my idea, so if you're gonna throw someone out, it should have been me.
Don't be ridiculous. I'm not throwing you out. How would that make me look?
Blake, I'm not gonna let her take the fall for this.
I should never have let her in. It didn't benefit us in any way.
Not everything we do has to benefit us.
Some people, Andie in particular, do what they love just because.
Isn't that why we started dancing in the first place?
Look, I have a lot to do for the fundraiser.
And so do you.
My decision about Andie is final. We're done here.
Oh, Peggy Beckham.
Here you are.
See, this is our new building.
Made of glass with state-of-the-art studios.
Hey. Is Andie here?
Andie? It's for you.
What are you guys doing here?
Andie, we're going. Eighth and Main, The Streets.
We need you.
No, but what about the fundraiser?
You could all be expelled. Forget the fundraiser. We don't want the school to move.
It's time we took a stand, Andie. Just like you did. And if MSA doesn't want you...
Then we don't want you. What are you talking about?
We do want Andie. We want Andie in, yes, right?
Yes. Look,
you brought us together
and took the fall for us when we should have all done more.
[Chase] Andie, that's why we're here.
We've all made a lot of mistakes, but now's our time.
We can go all the way.
If we don't try, then it was all for nothing. Come on, are you in?
I can't. [all] Why?
[Andie] I promised Sarah I'd finish packing tonight.
Andie?
Can we talk a minute?
Yeah. I'll be right back.
I made a promise to your mom to take care of you, and I want to keep it.
I know.
I understand that and I am done fighting.
You know, you remind me so much of your mother.
You have her passion.
She was a really good friend to me, Andie.
Just like you are to them.
I just feel like I finally found this place where I belong.
I found people who believe in me.
I believe in you, too.
I've seen a change in you, Andie.
You should go tonight.
Really?
She'd want you to.
Let's do this.
[DJ Sand] Baltimore, y'all ready?
We gonna get down to it, see who has the hottest skills.
The dopest squad.
You ready to get it started?
It's The Streets, baby.
[Missy] Take a left. [Smiles] And slow down.
[Kido] Faster, faster! I love America! Whoo!
It's your man, DJ Sand, and it's the battle of the year.
We're getting ready to get really banoodles out here. Can y'all handle that?
Baltimore, what's popping!
Yo, man, you see this?
Are you coming?
What part of "You don't belong here" do you not understand?
Why don't you chill?
We're just trying to perform here like everyone else.
[Tuck] Yo, homey, this is how it is. You're not invited.
This is a closed event. For locals only.
Besides, that jazz funk that y'all pulled at the Dragon ain't gonna cut it here.
Neither will those same moves you've been doing for the past five years.
And by the way, I really liked your place,
but I think that fish made it smell better.
What, you say something?
I will knock you out, boy!
Disrespect me in my place? You boys fighting in my house now?
You think you're funny, 'cause you coming from somewhere?
You want to tell me what the hell is going on?
They're at The Streets.
The Streets?
I have to stop this. Wait.
You always tell us that dance is about having something to say, right?
Yes, but, I never meant for anyone... Well, I think that
a lot of people are finally speaking up.
I can't just allow my students to participate in something illegal.
Well, there's a reason they're there and not here.
You should take a look for yourself. I think you'd be surprised.
And you are? I'm Robert Alexander III.
But you can call me Moose.
I dance with their crew. You dance?
Damn right, I dance. I can take you to where they are.
Okay, Goose, let's go.
No, it's Moose. Whatever. Wait. I'm coming with you guys.
[DJ Sand] This is the moment you've all been waiting for.
At this time, let me introduce the five time reigning champ.
Give it up, make some noise, for the 410!
[DJ Sand] Check it out, baby! That's what I'm talkin' about!
Give it up to the 410!
All right, you've seen 'em all.
Tell me who the hottest crew in Baltimore is.
Come on. That's what you think? I don't know, the 410 killed it.
All right, y'all, let's hit it.
[DJ Sand] That's how you feel, baby?
Whoa, B, what's going on?
Yo, this is a neighborhood battle.
You're out of luck.
Now, go home. Leave.
That's mad wack, B.
[DJ Sand] We're gonna get to it, figure it out after this.
Andie!
Hey, yo, it's not done yet. We've got one more for you.
My crew's back there. We want a shot.
Hey! Yo!
Look. We're all here because...
All right, all right.
Yo. Some of you guys think...
Some of you guys think that we don't belong here.
What is she doing? [Andie] It doesn't matter where we're from.
[woman] You are not the valedictorian.
All right, all right. All right.
Let me just say something.
The Streets are supposed to be about different people coming together.
We call this a battle, but what are we fighting for?
We're all here because we have this thing we do. We dance. Right?
Being a part of The Street used to mean much more than just turf or power.
It was about bringing something new to the floor.
And it shouldn't matter what we wear,
what school or what neighborhood we're from.
Because the best part about The Streets is that it's not about what you've got.
It's what you make of what you've got.
So, if the 410 is too scared to defend their title against us,
then, hell, we'll be outside doing our thing, where The Streets started.
We'll accept that.
I'm sure we've got something that will work.
Lada! Ooh!
Hit it, hit it, hit it.
Go, go, go!
[Chase] Yeah, we did it, baby.
All right! Whoo!
Well...
That was different.
[laughs] Yeah, sorry about the whole toe-pointing thing.
Yeah. I guess that didn't stick too well.
No, but, I'll keep working on that.
Yeah, you will, in my class.
At school on Monday.
Oh, my God! Whoa.
Hey, Moose!
Yeah, you.
I think you might be in the wrong department.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a little explaining to do at the fundraiser.
Oh, yeah.
So, see, I told you we could help each other out.
Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Whatever.
Blow it up.
Moose, hey.
Hey, Soph. How you doing?
I'm good. How are you?
Did you see us out there? That was great.
Sliding and flipping. My hat trick, it was amazing.
I mean, I was just doing it. I know.
Like, it was amazing.
That's what I thought.
Andie! Andie!
Hey! Happy birthday.
Open your present. Blow out your candles.
You did so good, mama. I'm so proud of you.
Andie, I love you.
I love you.
I gotta go.
I gotta pump. I gotta pump.
I thought you said we couldn't start our own crew.
I thought you said my dancing was little.
Coffee in Paris, surfed the Maldives, took a little nap on Mount Kilimanjaro.
And I got digits from this Polish chick in Rio.
Then I jumped back for the final quarter of the NBA Finals--courtside, of course.
And all that was before lunch.
All I'm saying is, I'm standing on top of the world.
It wasn't always like this.
Once I was a normal person, a chump just like you.
-Hey, Millie. -Hey, David.
A lot of cities there.
If you have a dream, might as well be big.
See you later.
Hey, Millie!
Give me a sec.
He's such a loser.
I wanted to give you this. I picked it up at a yard sale.
I thought you'd like it.
It's a little dinged up and missing a few steps, but....
I love it.
-You do? -I do.
Holy crap, Ricebowl!
What's this?
Christmas come early?
Mark, give it back to her.
Look what David got Millie! The Eiffel Tower!
If you shake it hard enough, the Eiffel Tower moves.
Who wants to shake this?
That's enough! Stop it. Just give it back.
Okay. I'm sorry. Here.
Sorry. I don't know my own strength.
-Why are you such a jerk? -I was playing around.
-It wasn't funny. -They thought it was funny.
David?
Don't go out there! It's not safe!
Just forget about it!
Don't be stupid, Ricebowl!
David, come back! Just let it go. It's okay.
Stop. It's not worth it. Just come back, please.
Come on, David.
-Be careful. Come on. -All good, see?
Good. Now come back.
-David! -Millie, don't go out there!
David! Get help, somebody!
Mark! Let go!
David! Help!
Help!
Please! Help! David!
Call 911!
David!
Millie, stop, stop!
And that's how it happened the first time.
One second I'm a goner...
...and next thing I know, I'm at the Ann Arbor Public Library.
Home sweet home.
Mom left when I was five.
And as for Dad, well, let's just say he wasn't much of one.
You're late!
Supper's cold.
Where were you, anyway?
When I ask a question, I expect an answer, okay?
What happened to you?
Just kids at school.
Hey! Get back down here, get a mop and clean this crap up now!
David! Don't make me come up there!
David? Make the right choice!
David! Open the door!
Did I just teleport?
Great.
I can teleport to a library.
What are you talking about? I'm not going.
Fine. We'll escort you.
-Get in the car. -I'm not going anywhere.
And that's when it occurred to me.
This thing that just happened...
...it could set me free.
If she could run away...so could I.
I wanted to tell her everything.
David?
I mean, who would have believed me anyway?
David?
I figured it was time to move on.
I'd like a room.
You won't be any trouble, will you? No weird stuff?
Nope. No weird stuff.
So there I was. I had a million questions.
Like how does this thing work? How do I control it?
-Been there. -Mommy!
-Mommy, you can see the ocean! -Maybe we'll see King Kong.
Really?
You got me?
I got you. I'm not letting you go.
I was fifteen.
Come on. What would you have done?
I figured I'd pay it back some day.
Is there a bathroom for customers?
It's this way.
Make it quick.
No problem. Thanks.
I'm going to need a bigger bag.
Holy shit.
I said no weird stuff!
Two days rent! You owe me rent!
Hello? Hello!
The police and FBI were already here. Who are you with?
NSA.
They couldn't make sense of it.
The vault has a time lock, steel plates. This guy didn't even--
Open a door?
We didn't find out until halfway through the day.
I want the security tapes for the month...
...and the name of everyone with a safety deposit box.
That's confidential. Why do you need those names?
Whoever robbed your vault has been in it before.
Now I want those names and I want those tapes, today.
So the story had a happy ending.
Ricebowl was dead, but I'd never been more alive.
Now I'm living in New York.
But why settle on one place when you can have the whole world?
--as you can see, this flood became more severe about 10 minutes ago.
The question now is, what will happen to these people?
It would take a miracle to get to them.
Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
-How are they doing? -Down by 6 at the half.
You won't need that umbrella.
You never know.
Watch it!
You mind if I join you?
No.
What are you drinking?
Gin and tonic.
Tanqueray and tonic. Two, please.
So, you live in London?
Taxi!
Shit.
This totally sucks.
I thought this was where the storm was supposed to hit.
I heard it hit Fiji.
Fiji?
They got 30-foot swells.
Really?
To your left! Move!
We have him!
Let's go.
-Why? -Because you are an abomination.
Only God should have the power to be all places at all times.
One less of you to worry about.
Cut him down! Let's get out of here.
We have a lead on the banks, sir.
I'll be on the next plane.
How'd they do, Angelo?
Not so good.
-I told you you didn't need an umbrella. -You were right.
Don't run.
Eight years we've been looking for you.
And who are you?
My name's Roland.
-What are you doing here? -We'll get to that.
IOU
What kind of crook leaves a note?
I need to talk to my lawyers.
Why? You're not under arrest.
-You're not the-- -Police?
Anybody can rob a bank. What I'd like to know is...
...how you rob a bank without opening any doors.
Come on. I'm sure you can think of something.
Look, uh...
...if you're not the police...
...and I'm not under arrest...
...I'd like you to leave.
Need some help with that?
Been a while since you used a door, huh?
Oh, I know who you are.
And I know what you are.
This conversation's over.
This conversation's not over until you answer my questions!
Tell me...
...how'd you last this long?
Who's helping you?
Jumpers.
Hard to jump with 1,000 volts of electricity passing through your brain.
Who's protecting you? Tell me, so I can go home.
I hate jumpers.
Did you think you'd do this forever?
Living like this, with no consequences?
There are always consequences.
Where are you going?
I got you now.
You think you can hide behind a wall?
Go anywhere?! Do anything?! Not anymore!
David?
David? Is that you?
David! Don't go! Don't go.
Just hear me out, okay?
David, I don't know...
...if I'm going crazy here or not.
I don't know a lot these days, but if you can hear me...
...just wait. Don't go! I have to talk to you!
David, if you can hear me, son...
...it's okay.
You can come home any time you want.
You're not crazy.
Telecommunications.
This is Roland.
He got away.
We have his jump sites.
I want everybody up and running. Everybody.
Who is this?
May I help you?
Yeah, uh....
Hi, Mrs. Harris. It's me, David.
David? David Rice?
-Millie was right. You're not-- -Dead? No, I'm not.
Actually, I was hoping you could tell me where Millie is.
Millie? She has her own place over on Morton, number 260.
She's still here?
Yeah. She works at Hoolihan's Bar, down by the campus.
Millie, I need those pitchers!
Okay, you saw her.
Holy crap! Ricebowl?
Mark! Mark Kobold!
Sorry. I don't know you.
Jesus Christ, am I seeing a ghost? Is this some kind of sixth sense shit?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Everybody, it's Ricebowl!
Come on, grab a beer with a buddy from high school.
-I'm not this-- -David?
I knew it was the Ricecake.
Millie?
Hi. You were going to leave without saying anything?
I didn't see you.
No? Haven't you been staring at me for the past 45 minutes?
Yeah, David. Why didn't you say something?
-I think you're drunk. -I am not. I'm cool. I am totally, 110% cool.
I'm cool. I am totally, 110% cool.
Yeah, that was cool. Why don't you go sleep it off, okay?
Why don't you go make me a drink, sweetheart?
With a splash of that. 242
Stop it! 242
Stop!
Ricebowl goes down!
What did you do to me? Freak!
I guess I don't know my own strength.
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
Where's Mark?
He took off.
I don't think he's going to come back anytime soon.
You're bleeding a little.
We should take care of that. Come on.
You saw me as soon as I came in?
Maybe.
I didn't know what to say.
How about, "Hi." "Hello." "Been a long time." "How are you?"
Hi.
Hello. Been a long time. How are you?
I'm good. How are you?
Why don't we skip this boring stuff?
-I didn't think you'd still be here. -Where else would I be?
You had those lists. You were going to travel the world, and....
Things change. We all need to grow up, right?
What do you do?
Banking. I'm in banking.
Banking? How did you get into that?
It's pretty easy, actually. Just sort of landed in it.
Didn't you flunk algebra?
No.
-Fiona, I'm going to take my break now. -Sure.
So...
...you're back. What now? What's your plan?
Maybe do some traveling.
I was thinking of checking out Rome, actually.
You were "thinking of checking out Rome"?
That was my dream. Don't try to rip me off.
-So come with me. -Come with you?
You're asking me to go to Rome?
Only if you want to "skip the boring parts".
I got it.
-I'll take it! -If you like.
Can you believe just 10 hours ago we were in Ann Arbor?
What does the CIA want with this?
I'm afraid that's classified.
Really?
Then I'm afraid I'll have to see a federal warrant.
I don't believe you are who you say you are.
Certainly.
Great. Another cop.
So, Mark...
...what happened at the bank?
I told them already.
You're just another suit. You'll never believe me.
It says here you were "beamed" into the vault.
You want to laugh about it? Go ahead, laugh.
You hear me laughing?
The girl's name is Millie Harris.
She boarded a plane to Rome 16 hours ago and she didn't go alone.
So, what do you think?
I think there's something you're not telling me.
What do you mean?
This room.
First class.
Usually in my life, when things seem too good to be true, they are.
-I told you, I'm in-- -Banking?
I know that you flunked algebra.
If you don't want to tell me everything, that's fine.
But don't lie to me.
I'm not lying to you.
No?
Good.
I can't reach it.
I could eat.
You could have just asked me on a date.
This has always been number one on my list.
-I know. -You must be pretty good at this, huh?
Good at what?
Rookie.
No idea.
No, sorry, sir. Sorry, sorry. No.
No, it's closed.
What do you mean, it's closed? How is it closed?
-We just want to go inside there. -No, it's impossible.
-How is it closed? -It's impossible
David, it's okay. I got to see it from the outside. That's good enough.
She came all this way to go in.
Come on.
Sorry, he's-- I don't know.
Millie! Come on.
How about a private tour?
It's closed. We can't break in.
Who said it's closed? The door was open.
You want to see it or not?
Come on.
We so should not be doing this.
-This place is amazing. -I wanted you to see this.
You have to admit it's worth the risk.
It's so cool!
Down there is where they kept the gladiators, and the lions in cages.
-We should go down there. -We can't. It's off-limits.
Nothing's off-limits.
What?
Was that door just open, too?
It's open now.
You'll want to see this. Trust me.
Bet that's worth something.
Maybe.
I think he's saying "Do not enter".
Do you speak Italian?
Nope.
-Well, "l'ingresso" means "Come on in". -Oh, I thought it meant "bullshit".
It means you stay here while I go around and open it from the other side.
It's okay. You'll catch on.
Thank you very much. The next showing is at 6:00.
Don't forget to tip your usher.
A little busy here.
I can see.
Never mind.
I wouldn't open that door.
Not if I wanted my girlfriend to keep breathing.
What are you going to do, bring her down for a nice, romantic picnic?
-Is that what you think? -If you even look at her--
What will you do? Jump me away?
Did you think you were the only one?
You really have no idea, do you?
Did you think you could just go on a Roman holiday and they wouldn't notice?
Just jump all over the place. Jump, jump, jump. And nothing will happen?
They've noticed.
Not me. I already knew. I'm not talking about me, but them.
Down there.
Hello, boys.
Just me, then.
Ah...that's new.
Welcome to the war.
Let me know if you get tired!
Close.
David?
What's going on?
Let's meet the girlfriend.
Who are these people?
Paladins. Paladins kill jumpers. I kill Paladins. Class dismissed.
Wait!
I came through your jump scar.
What are you doing here?
If I were you, I'd jump back.
You're not supposed to see this stuff.
So if you'd kindly fuck off...
...as in now, maybe your girlfriend's still alive.
-What happened to you? -Nothing.
Let's go. I think we should get out of here.
That didn't sound like nothing.
You were right. I shouldn't have gone down there.
Come on. We can still make the museum.
Will you talk to me?
There must be a cab.
Will you please just talk to me?
-I'll tell you back at the hotel. -I'm not waiting for the hotel.
Millie, it's all fine, okay?
-It's not fine. -I wasn't supposed to go back there.
-I think you guys made a mistake. -Be quiet.
I know I wasn't supposed to be back there.
You're looking for that guy.
Can you let us off with a warning? Okay, okay.
Go back to the hotel.
Yes, I'm with him. I'm with him!
I don't know her. Millie, go to the hotel.
I told you...
...I want to see Millie.
Where is the body?
I didn't do anything. How many times do you want me to say that?
How much longer will he be?
We wait for magistrato.
Yeah, I know. We've been waiting all night.
-I don't know what you said. -Sit or we seat you.
Okay.
-Sit! -I sit.
She has nothing to do with this.
The magistrate is here. We will keep your passport.
Don't worry, you don't need it where you're going.
Hello, David.
You've only got 30 seconds before they come through that door. You have to go.
Ditch the girl. If she's with you, she's dead.
Mom!
Twenty seconds, David.
Mom!
Mom!
Millie.
All done. Are you okay?
-We're free to walk. -They let you go?
They let me go.
-Just like that. -Just like that.
If they let you go, then why are we running?
They strongly suggested we leave town now.
-What did they say to you? -Just asked questions.
For eight hours?
They had a lot of questions.
I really want to trust you, but--
So trust me. Let's go.
Hey, can you take us?
Get in the cab, Millie.
Millie, get in the car.
Please, please get in the cab.
That's yours.
Remember how I told you didn't need to tell me everything?
I changed my mind.
What's in the backpack?
Where did you get that?
I don't want to lie.
But you don't want to tell the truth, either.
I can't get on this flight with you. This is as far as we go together.
To Detroit?
Roland.
We lost him, sir.
-How many did you send? -Two.
I said to send everyone.
She said two was enough. But they missed him.
It's like he knew we were coming.
We're searching the grid now.
Keep me informed. I'm taking a different tack.
William Rice?
IRS.
Could we...
...go inside and talk?
I don't have to ask. That's a courtesy.
So what's this about?
Your son, David.
Why? Is he in some kind of trouble?
This will go a lot swifter if you let me ask the questions.
When's the last time you saw your son?
Eight years ago.
-Eight years? -That's right.
What about friends?
-Anybody I can talk to? -He didn't have a lot of friends.
I'd like to talk to David's mother.
Me, too. If you find her, tell her I said hello.
Is that her?
Mary Rice was her name back then.
When's the last time you saw her?
-She split when the kid turned five. -Five.
Haven't heard a word since.
If I hear anything, I'll be sure to give you a holler.
No, you won't.
No, I won't.
Have you seen this new thing?
It's a new control. If you just double click....
See that? It's pretty.
Still alive, are you?
He's dead!
What?! That's just great.
-There's more of them? -Hundreds more.
I'm tracking ten right now. What do you care?
-What about the rest? -What about them?
Like I said, I hunt them.
-Who are these guys? -I told you, Paladins.
You told me their name but not what they want.
Simple. They want us dead. Didn't you figure that out?
-I got that much. -Good. Do you mind just, uh...?
-Why? -Because we do whatever we want.
Now can you...?
-He's dead. -Great.
Thanks.
You really don't get it.
Paladins have been killing jumpers for years, since medieval times.
They're fanatics, religious nut jobs.
The Inquisition, witch hunts, that was them.
They're smart...
...fast and organized. They'll kill anyone who gets in their way...
...like your family, your friends...
...that little girlfriend you had traipsing around Rome.
They're dead. All of them.
Get used to it. It's a matter of time.
I'm getting take-away. Want some?
Somebody get some help!
Now!
-What happened? -What's going on?
Let me look. Get the paddles!
He smashed through the glass in the other room?
Are you okay? Stay still.
How is he?
-I'm not getting a pulse. -Defib!
What the hell happened here?
-Mark. -Jesus Christ.
What did you tell him? How did they know about Ann Arbor?
Stay away from me!
Was it a black guy, white hair? Was his name Roland?
Just answer the question, or...
...I'll drop you off Mount Everest.
-What did you tell him?! -What?! Tell what?!
I know you told him about Ann Arbor. Did you tell him about Millie?
-I told him everything. -Why did you do that?!
-Why not? -God!
Who are you?
Where'd the Paladin go?
-Swimming. -Pacific?
No, Atlantic. A nice little shark pit around Cuba.
What are you doing? Put that back.
-I need to borrow this. -Just stay away from the wall!
I'll cut your eyes out!
-I need to find Roland. -No, you don't!
I only got 8 hours.
-Her flight lands in 8 hours. -That stuff won't help. It's 4 years old.
Shall I jump you back to high school, so you can learn something?
Look.
See this? Our first round in Nepal.
You should see the one he gave me in Prague.
Forget it. Forget Roland.
Don't waste your time. Just leave it to me.
You mind?
A little privacy? This is my thing.
Just, you know, turn around.
I was thinking that if we do this together...
...we could get him.
You mean like you and me?
Like we team up.
Look, I'm sorry, but I don't play well with others.
Do me a favor.
Don't be here when I get back. Find a rock, crawl under it, stay there.
Joi wooi, brother.
It's "good-bye" in Chinese.
I've been meaning to call. I still want to get the tattoo.
You can't keep following me.
Actually, I'm the one person who can.
Lucky me.
Why are you walking?
I know Tokyo. I got a lot of jump sites, so--
I like walking for a change. It makes me feel normal.
Did you ever read Marvel Team-up?
Yeah, I've read it. And?
Two superheroes joining forces for a limited run.
I see what you're trying to do. I'm not buying it.
For your own sake, just go home.
-You live in a cave. -It's called a lair. And what's the point?
I'm just saying, we kind of have this common thing.
I know where to find Roland.
So we doing this, or what?
Sorry. The clutch stuck.
You're real subtle.
I'm not gonna get rid of you, am I?
Might want to hold on, son.
That was close.
Not bad.
This thing must be two tons. How are you...?
If it moves, I can jump it.
I knew a jumper, crazy bastard, who tried to hop a whole building.
Won't be trying that again.
-Why? -'Cause he's dead.
Killed him.
He managed to shake it a little, though.
How long have you done this?
-Done what? Driven? -No, jumping.
-Since I was five. -Five?
How do you keep it secret from people, like your parents?
It's easy when they're not around.
-Where were they? -Not around.
My mom took off when I was five.
I know what it's like to not....
My dad, he....
Did I ask about your family?
I mean, are we on Oprah?
I can't keep doing this! I have to go.
Her flight's landing soon. I need an answer.
This is it. Marvel Team-Up, now or never.
A very limited run, right?
Save her, kill him. We're done.
All right, Spidey.
Due to increased security measures, all bags are subject to search.
Detroit International Airport...
...asks you to keep your bags in your possession at all times.
Her flight landed an hour ago.
Oh, no.
You didn't check the flight.
We have to find her.
You find her. I'll arm up. Meet me back at the lair.
Fine.
What're you looking at?
Hey. I'm Millie's friend, David.
Is she here?
Last I checked, she was with you.
Hey! Your friend came by.
What?
Black guy, white hair. You just missed him.
Come on.
Jesus.
David...
...what the hell are you doing here?
I buzzed, but you didn't pick up.
So you broke in?
To make sure you were okay.
No, I'm not okay.
I got left in an airport in Rome.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
Thank you.
I think you should leave.
David, you need to leave!
Snap to it. We don't have much time.
What are you doing?
David, I told you to leave.
"Um", what?
-I'm not in banking. -No, really?
I mean, the money did come from a bank. A few banks, actually.
Are you telling me you're a bank robber?
That's a small part.
Get out of my house!
Millie, I'm sorry.
-We have to go. -Leave me alone!
Come on!
This might hurt a bit.
It's okay.
Trust me, okay?
-The first jump's a bit rough. -Get away.
Don't come near me!
I'll explain everything, okay?
In here.
Just stay where you are. Stay there.
Hurry up! It's closing!
Griffin!
I have to tell you something.
You find her?
-It's going to piss you off. -Piss me off?
What is this?
What is she doing here?! This isn't some kind of clubhouse!
You want to see the top of Mount Everest? Maybe the bottom?
Griffin, listen to me.
By bringing her here, they can follow you! They have a machine.
-It can open wormholes. -What do you mean?
They can follow us anywhere!
And you brought her here!
Oh, shit.
There's two of you? What is going on?
Millie, stay here!
What have you done? Where does this thing go?
Where does this thing go?
Holy shit.
Mom?
Thanks for leading me to your friend.
Wait! Why are you doing this to me?
I never hurt you. I never hurt anybody.
Not yet, but you will.
Sooner or later, you all go bad.
What if I'm different?
-You're not different. -I'm different.
Move!
It's time to send you home to Mommy.
David?
Millie, get out of here. Run, okay?
Millie, run!
I'm freeing you so you can get me home.
Okay.
Can you take me now?
Okay, I'll take you, and...
...I'll leave you alone.
It was always you, though.
Ever since we were five. It was always you.
Please just take me.
Take a deep breath.
I got it! I trapped them there.
Without the machine, they're screwed!
Got her!
Shit!
Bloody.... Wow.
Crap. I didn't expect that. I didn't know.
Now they have to come to us.
Get these fires out.
What's that?
What are you doing?
I was thinking about going bowling.
Roland's in there with his whole army.
I'm gonna go back there and blow 'em to Timbuktu.
Millie's in there.
-Well, there is that as well. -I have to go get her.
It's my fault that she's there.
-What? -We have to get her out of there.
-We have to get her! -I heard you! I'm not deaf!
I can actually hear.
It's a crying shame, but we all have to make sacrifices.
You know.
Where's the detonator?
-You're not making any. -I made mine.
Alright?
When I was five.
He came to my house and killed my parents.
David, David.
Let's just talk about this.
How about this for talking? Am I getting the message through to you?
I can't let you do this.
Touch this safe again and I'll kill you. Have you got it?
Give me the detonator, David!
Give it back! Sorry, Griffin!
Give it back!
Don't.
Bad move.
Oh, shit.
I hate Chechnya!
Where'd you go?
Well then, brother, I guess our limited run is done.
The old electricity trick? That was a nice move.
Thanks.
Cut me down and we can finish this.
It didn't have to be this way.
There's five of them back there! You go back alone, you're dead! You can't win!
Get me down!
Do this alone and you're dead!
You're not a hero, David!
You're a jumper! We don't save the girl!
Don't you get it?
Out of the way!
-Throw a tether! -Got him!
There are some things you can't jump!
Only God should have this power.
Not you, David.
David, I'm so sorry about what I said before.
Take a deep breath.
David?
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Where are we?
Why is my dishwasher in the library?
I'm impressed.
Stay here.
You've come a long way from robbing banks.
I told you I'm different.
I could have dropped you with the sharks.
Can I help you?
Is Mary here?
Mom?
Honey, wait upstairs.
-It wasn't easy finding you. -You shouldn't be here.
So it's true.
You're one of them.
Yes, it's true.
You were five years old, your first jump. I had two choices:
Kill you or leave you.
So you left.
To protect you.
I was five.
I did what I had to do.
I've never stopped thinking about you, not even for one day.
-So I'm a jumper, you're a Paladin. -That's right.
What now?
I'm giving you a head start, son.
Because I love you.
Good luck.
-You okay? -Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah, I am.
Those words had been dancing around my head all night.
I mean, it's Vegas lore, that phrase.
Just ask any of the old-time pit bosses, they'll know.
It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's who was first credited with the line.
He would shout it every time he dealt blackjack.
That was over 40 years ago, and the words still catch.
Winner, winner, chicken dinner. There it is!
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."
Yeah, try it.
I had heard it at least 14 times that night.
I couldn't lose.
First of all, what I was doing wasn't illegal.
There were certain institutions and people that frowned upon it,
but it's legal.
And not everyone can do it.
Just those with gifted minds.
I have a gifted mind.
That's what got me into all this mess.
I was counting cards and I was up over $640,000.
All right! I'm just gonna have to split those tens.
-Splitting tens. -Splitting tens again.
Well, that's all right. I've been winning and losing for years.
We used hand signals too.
Folded arms, the table's hot.
A touch to the eye, we need to talk.
And a hand running through perfect flowing hair meant only one thing.
Get out. Now.
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."
Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.
Premed.
4.0 GPA.
44 MCATs.
President, American Legion Math League.
TA to Professors Wilkins and Sanders.
Both of whom are friends of mine, and who wrote glowing recommendations.
And you're accepted early into school here at Harvard Med,
pending graduation from MIT. It's very impressive.
Thank you.
The Robinson Scholarship is comprehensive, as you know.
It's a free ride. And free rides don't come easy.
Absolutely.
We have 76 applicants this year, only one of whom will get the scholarship
and most of whom have résumés just as impressive as yours.
Right.
Professor Phillips?
Some kids grow up wanting to play for the Red Sox.
You know, some grow up wanting to be, I don't know, a fireman.
I grew up... Well, really, I just wanted to come here to Harvard Med.
And now that I've gotten accepted, it seems to only come down to the money.
Which I don't really have.
So, what I'm trying to say
So, what I'm trying to say is that I really, really need this scholarship.
Did you rehearse that?
Yeah. Like, 14 times in front of the mirror.
Unfortunately, desire doesn't figure into this much.
The Robinson is going to go to someone who
dazzles.
Somebody who just jumps off the page.
Oh, well, then, I'm also involved in a science competition.
We're building a robotic wheel
that can navigate itself using a proprietary GPS system.
Well, I'm designing the system. So...
Right.
Ben, last year, the Robinson went to Hyum Jae Wook,
a Korean immigrant who has only one leg.
Well, I have both my legs.
Well, have you considered cutting one of them off?
That was a joke.
Ben, it's all about the essay.
You need to really explain to us what makes you special.
What life experience separates you from all the rest.
Life experience.
What can you tell me, Ben,
that's going to dazzle me?
I'm so sorry I'm late.
-Where is your jacket? -Oh, I got it. I got it. It's right here.
This is no way for the new assistant manager to come to work.
Congratulations. How does $8 an hour sound?
Eight dollars?
Wow! Wow. That's great, Warren. Thank you. Thank you.
You slept with him, didn't you?
-Yes, I did. Yes, I did. -Yes, you did.
I'll sleep with him, too, and I'll get $8 an hour.
So Palmer finishes up his lecture, right? And I say to him,
"Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need at least 14 capacitance probes
"to get the kind of results that you're looking for," okay?
So then he says to me, "Miles, don't you think that's a little excessive?"
And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up in front of the entire class and I say,
"You can never have enough capacitance probes."
Oh, my God. What the hell is wrong with you?
Oh, nothing.
I hope nothing. You just got promoted, man. You should be happy.
I just gotta write this essay for the Robinson Scholarship,
and I have nothing.
And the reason that I have nothing is 'cause, well, I've done nothing.
-Oh, give me a break, Ben. -What?
You have everything.
You blow me out of the water, and I'm a cerebral stud. Is that nothing?
Yeah, well, it doesn't dazzle.
Hey. It dazzles me, mister.
You know, ever since I was 16, I crushed exams.
I took on extracurriculars. I showed up early.
I even sat up at the front and I stayed late.
Man, I gave up everything.
You know, I gave up fun. I gave up sex.
I don't think you gave up sex.
-Okay. Maybe not sex. -Yeah, you didn't give up sex.
All right, all right. Not sex, but...
It just annoys me that the one thing
that is stopping me from going to Harvard Med is money.
You know, tuition fees and living expenses alone cost over $300,000.
$300,000.
It's outrageous. It's astronomically high. I get that.
You know, I just thought there was more to life than just money.
Well, look at the bright side,
I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance.
Thank you.
-Happy birthday, honey. -Thanks, Mom.
Thank you, love. Kisses.
Make a wish.
-Make a wish. -Okay.
Bravo.
Congratulations, Benjamin.
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that? You see that?
It took me five minutes to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...
Where the next number is 21. Now you're slipping, Cam.
Cam, you owe another six bucks.
No, no. I didn't eat any of the Buffalo wings.
Oh, really? That's great. Well, we're not doing it that way.
We're just dividing equally. So let's say you pay.
-I got it, all right? -No, no.
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
It's your birthday. You're as broke-ass as I am.
I just wish now I had eaten some of those wings.
So, I nailed the specs on the 2.09 last night,
after 19 cups of coffee.
-Check it out. -You are kidding.
-What is this? -You're kidding!
This is good. Miles, this is good.
Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what we've been working for since we got here.
This is called destiny.
You know, there is the... Thank you.
There is the possibility that we might not actually win this thing.
Oh, yeah? Bite your tongue! Bite your damn tongue!
Look, guys,
we don't date, we don't travel, we don't have any money.
The only thing that we do have is the 2.09 Competition.
If we can't even win that, what's the point?
Hey, hey. Look at this!
No, no, no, no.
Yeah. We suck.
Your father would be so proud of you, Ben.
Yeah.
Do you remember anything about him?
Not really. Maybe when he shaved?
Yeah, I think I watched him shave.
So, what are your plans for the rest of the night?
I don't know. I'll probably just go back and work on that essay.
Ben, you're working too hard.
Between the job and school and the 2.09, you've had no time for just yourself.
You have to squeeze in a little time for fun, Ben.
You only turn 21 once. And it goes by very fast.
Okay. All right.
-Good night. -All right, good night.
-Don't come home before 3:00. -All right.
All right.
Now, who can explain Newton's method and how you use it?
You can use it to solve nonlinear equations.
That's impressive. That's really good. I mean, I'm very impressed by that,
especially since my class is called Nonlinear Equations.
All right, now somebody tell me something I don't already know.
Anyone?
Bueller. Anyone? Bueller.
Newton stole it.
-I'm sorry? -Newton stole it.
Joseph Raphson published this same method 50 years earlier.
And if the start value is too far removed from true zero, then it fails.
-I'm sorry, what's your name? -Ben. Ben Campbell.
Ben.
So Ben Campbell suggests that Joseph Raphson
was the original author of this method.
Well, if that's the case, then why didn't he get any credit?
Well, for one thing, Newton had a better publicist.
And for another, after 1700, we know very little about Raphson
other than the fact that he discovered the Kabbalah
about 300 years before Madonna.
All right, now, let's give Ben a chance for some extra credit, shall we?
We're gonna call this the game show host problem, all right?
Ben, suppose you're on a game show.
And you are given a chance to choose from three different doors, all right?
Now, behind one of the doors is a new car. Behind the other two, goats.
Which door would you choose, Ben?
Door number one?
Door number one. Ben chooses door number one.
All right, now, the game show host,
who, by the way, knows what's behind all the other doors,
decides to open another door. Let's say he chooses door number three.
Behind which sits a goat. Now...
Ben, game show host comes up to you.
He says, "Ben, do you want to stay with door number one
"or go with door number two?"
Now, is it in your interest to switch your choice?
-Yeah. -Well, wait.
Remember, the host knows where the car is
so how do you know he's not playing a trick on you?
Trying to use reverse psychology to get you to pick a goat?
Well, I wouldn't really care. I mean, my answer's based on statistics.
Based on variable change.
Variable change? But he just asked you a simple question.
Yeah, which changed everything.
Enlighten us.
Well, when I was originally asked to choose a door,
I had a 33.3% chance of choosing right.
But after he opens one of the doors and then re-offers me the choice,
it's now 66.7% if I choose to switch.
So, yeah, I'll take door number two, and thank you for that extra 33.3%.
Exactly.
People, remember,
if you don't know which door to open, always account for variable change.
Now, see, most people wouldn't take the switch
out of paranoia, fear, emotions.
But Mr. Campbell, he kept emotions aside
and let simple math get his ass into a brand-new car!
Which is better than that goat you've been driving around campus.
All right, everybody.
That's the end of the day. Thank you very much.
Your graded papers are down here at the end.
You can pick them up on your way out.
I am invincible.
Guys, Jill Taylor, 10 o'clock.
Man. That's brutal.
You know, you should just ask her out, man.
It's not like she's a rocket scientist or anything.
Oh, wait, she is.
Well, why don't you ask her?
Because I'm already dating someone.
Yeah, your right hand doesn't count, Miles.
It does the way I use it. It does the way I use it.
Hey, you know what? Maybe I don't even want to go out with her.
Yeah, that's funny.
You know, you say you want a life experience, right?
Well, I'd say getting down with that would definitely qualify.
Cam!
Boy genius.
You have to follow me now.
-Excuse me? -You have to follow me now.
Come on.
-Where are we going? -You'll see.
Our honored guest.
-How you doing, Ben? -I'm okay.
-You ever been in this room before? -Yeah.
Organic Chemistry in my freshman year.
-How'd you do? -Well, I got an A.
-Professor Rosa... -Micky, please.
Is there a problem with my paper?
Well, you found a more efficient method for finding true zero than Isaac Newton
and that, my friend, is not so much of a problem as it is a major ass-kicking.
Although Newton has been dead for over 250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight.
So, is this some kind of a math club?
Don't be rude, people.
-Kianna. -Fisher.
-Choi. -Jill.
-You ever studied blackjack? -No.
No, really? Well, it's really simple, actually.
You play against the dealer.
You're given two cards.
Face cards are worth 10 points.
The closest to 21 wins.
If you go over, you lose. If the dealer goes over, they lose.
It's the most popular card game in the world.
It's a game of memory.
Cards drawn are the past, ones to come are future.
And the best part, it's beatable.
Are you talking about counting cards?
No. I'm talking about getting very, very rich.
You count cards, right? All of you?
As a team, yes.
-When? -Weekends. And Christian holidays.
-Where? -Vegas, baby.
So, why are you telling me?
Well, let's just say a spot opened up on our roster.
How?
Jimmy got a job at Google.
-Jimmy got a job at Google? -Yeah, it's catchy, I know.
Well, if you're making so much money at this, then why did he take it?
Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler.
Yeah... This is crazy.
No, Ben. This is profitable.
Yeah, I can't do it. So, I'm sorry.
-Come on, Ben. It'll be fun. -Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun.
No, it's not that. It's...
I just got a promotion at my job, so it's kind of not a good time for me.
We pay better.
Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends.
Why not? MIT's on cruise control for you, you've already gotten into Harvard Med.
I mean, what do you have to worry about?
-How did you know that? -I like to take an interest in my students.
Well, I'm also really involved in the science competition.
You know, the 2.09 Competition?
Wait, no. I'm building a car that drives by itself.
Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing with my friends for over a year,
so it's kind of important.
Ben, let the car drive by itself.
Listen, you not only have a gifted mind, but you're also composed.
You don't give in to your emotions. You think logically.
Ben, you were born for this.
You'll have more fun than you've ever had in your entire life.
It's perfect.
Thank you. But I'm really not the right guy.
So I'm sorry.
Ben.
I hope this little conversation we just had will remain private.
-No, of... -No.
You're one of my favorite new students, and I'd hate to lose you, if you know what I mean.
and I'd hate to lose you, if you know what I mean.
-I'm just not sure it's me. -It's boring.
It's boxy. It's blue. How is that not you?
So, how much is this thing gonna run me?
Oh, well, let's see, the belt's $49.95, minus 15%.
The jacket's $589.99.
The pants, $285.99, minus 10% for both.
Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale, but I can knock off 5% from the $69.99.
The shoes were just marked down from $155,
so you're looking at $1,042.68.
I'm pretty good with numbers.
-Yeah. -I guess so.
Yeah, so let me know when I can ring that up for you guys.
-Yes. Thank you. -Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
-Could you help me? -Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.
I'm looking for a tie.
Oh, well, we're having a 15% sale on the ties.
And if you want, I could probably get you an additional 10%
with my employee discount.
-This one's nice. -Yeah. Oh, yeah.
This one has actually been treated with our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection,
you know, to repel liquids and stains.
-Well, that's really functional. -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty functional.
Face me. Stay still.
Despite being tempted by the Nano-Tex repellant,
I'm actually not here for a tie, Ben.
I came to see you.
You did?
Blackjack's a great game.
No, look, it's easy to learn
and there's really not as much strategy to it as people think.
I grew up on it, actually.
-You grew up on it? -Yeah.
Every night after dinner, my father and I would play.
I knew basic strategy before I was, like, nine years old.
If I won, he'd take me out for ice cream.
And what if he won?
He'd still take me out for ice cream.
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah, he's your dad.
Ben, you should feel the thrill
of winning more money than you can possibly imagine.
I think you should come to Vegas.
'Cause I'm guessing that you could probably use a break from this place.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
Okay. If you change your mind, you know where we meet.
Yeah.
You're welcome any time.
You know, I think the best thing about Vegas
is you can become anyone you want.
-What's the count? -Plus 9.
-No. -Plus 11.
No.
-Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago. -Don't call me "dude."
-Plus 9? -You're just following Jill.
People, please. We had a total of 76 cards that came out of the deck.
Twenty-three were high cards with a value of minus one.
Seventeen were neutral with no value at all,
and the rest were low cards with a value of plus one.
-How could you lose the count? -Plus 13.
The count. It's plus 13.
Yes.
Pull up a chair.
Stop.
-What is it? -Plus 12. Eggs.
Twelve eggs in a carton.
-Now what? -Plus 9.
Cats have nine lives.
Cat.
Sweet 16.
Every card had a value.
A high card, minus one. A low card, plus one.
The rest, zero.
Plus 13. Plus 8. Plus 9. Plus 12.
I was studying all day, every day.
But it wasn't physics, chemistry and engineering. I was back to simple math,
used in ways I could never have imagined.
The team had a system.
And to go unnoticed, we created a whole new language.
Words were numbers, and numbers were words.
-Plus 17. -Magazine.
-Plus 6. -Gun.
-Plus 15. -Paycheck.
Plus 12.
Is this chemistry review?
-Plus 14. -Ring.
-Plus 16. -Sweet.
Use it in a sentence.
Man, that sugar's sweet.
Because I knew the count, I knew which cards were left in the deck.
That's how I knew what to bet.
You're doing great.
Micky, I just want to let you know that I'm only doing this for medical school,
which is $300,000.
I mean, if I can get anything close to that, then I'm done.
Well, in the first place, Ben, it's not "if," it's "when."
And second of all, I get it. I completely understand.
-You do? -Yeah. It's a means to an end.
Look, they've got this new computer software that reads people's faces,
so who knows how long this gig's gonna last for any of us?
What if we get caught?
Our system keeps us under the radar, you'll see.
Anyway, counting cards isn't illegal.
-So, there's no danger in it at all? -No, Ben, it's safe. Very safe.
You think you can beat the system?
This is the system, beating you back.
You wanna count cards, you do it in Atlantic City.
-Get him up. -Come on, kid.
Count to five.
-Count to five! -What?
Count to five so I know you don't have brain damage, you can go home.
Start with one.
One, two, three, four, five.
Good. Now, stop counting.
Let's go.
You're crazy, everybody knows to split eights.
My grandmother splits eights.
Not against a 10. It's a sucker play.
Look, you're choosing to play two hands
against the highest up card a dealer can have, right?
Against a five or a six, it'd be fine.
Against a 10 or an ace, it's a sucker play.
Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right? Jill's right. All right?
Choi, why don't you explain to Ben how we do?
Oh, all right.
So, our team is divided into two kinds of players,
spotters and big players, right?
So if you think that this table is the casino floor,
then salt and pepper shakers are your spotters.
Spotters are just sitting at the various blackjack tables
and they're betting the table minimum. They never fluctuate their bet.
That's right. Spotters never raise the bet or play any kind of progressive system.
That's how we stay under the radar, and that's why we never get caught.
Exactly. Okay, they're just sitting at the table, betting the table min,
and they're keeping the count waiting for one of these decks to get hot.
Right. And then when one of the decks gets hot,
the spotter at that table signals in the big player.
This... Mustard. Give me the mustard, honey. Please.
Well, I'm always the mustard, so...
When I get the signal for the hot deck, I stumble over like some drunk rich kid,
or some zoned out dot-com millionaire, and I throw down big money.
So the big player bets big and still keeps the count.
When the deck cools, he cashes in.
It's not as easy as it sounds.
Oh, yeah, it's not, you know,
because if Grey Poupon over here ever loses the count,
it's up to his table's spotter to give him the signal to get out.
-And you know the signals, right? -Yeah.
Show us.
Okay, what's this?
-The deck's hot. -Right.
We need to talk.
The deck's cooling.
And get out. Get out now.
Good. I think he's gonna be ready for our little trial run tomorrow.
There's a trial run?
-Where? -You'll find out.
Hey.
-You Ben? -Yeah.
Follow me.
This way.
Go, go. You go.
No more bet. No more bet.
Come on, money.
Today, 14.
Whose side are you on?
Sixteen.
Thank you. Sorry, gentlemen.
So, Henry, did I tell you I read about this place in a magazine?
-You wanna put that money down? -Yeah. $300.
$300.
$300.
You bet, sir?
Thanks.
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner." All right.
Nice.
Can I get another drink, please?
Thank you.
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing? I haven't done anything! Get off me!
Get off, I haven't done anything!
Please. Please let go.
-What's the count? -Please don't hurt me.
-I said, what's the count? -Look, I haven't even done anything!
What's the count?
Plus 18.
Oh, you've gotta be kidding.
Congratulations, Ben.
Sorry, we had to make sure you'd keep the count under pressure.
Welcome to the team.
We didn't mean it.
It's okay, Campbell, I cried inside that bag.
Fisher and Jimmy have always been the big players.
I want you to take Jimmy's place.
I've never done this.
I know that and I understand.
But I don't trust the girls, and Choi is, well, Choi.
Look, I've been teaching for more than 14 years,
and I've never had a student as impressive as you.
Your brain is like a goddamn Pentium chip.
You're gonna do great. You know how I know that?
'Cause you remind me of myself 25 years ago.
You in?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm in. -Good. Good.
There's one more thing, Ben, and this is important.
We're counting cards, we're not gambling.
We're following a specific set of rules and playing a system.
Right.
I've seen how crazy it can get at those tables,
and sometimes, people lose control.
They give in to their emotions.
You will not.
You understand?
Yeah.
Get some rest.
-Some rest? -Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.
Tomorrow? I have a Quantitative Literacy paper due Tuesday.
-No, you don't. -I don't?
No, I spoke to Professor O'Reilly.
I told him you were helping me with a special assignment,
and he understood, so he gave you an A.
You see, Ben, amazing things can happen from the inside.
You'll get a call about details later.
So did the girls go on ahead, huh?
Oh, yeah. They got a lot more bags to check, you know?
Okay.
Well, wait for us by security 'cause Ben and I are gonna hit the head.
No, I'm good.
No, I really think you should go. It's a long flight.
-No, I'm okay. -We're going to the bathroom.
Honestly, I really don't have to go.
-I don't care what you have to do. -Look, I really don't have to...
-I don't care what you have to do. -Look, I really don't have to... Please just shut up.
Why are you looking over there? Look, I don't...
I don't care. Shut up. Get in here.
-What are you doing? -Let's go.
-Pull down your pants. -What?
Don't ask questions.
-Shove these in your underwear. -Why?
You want me to do it? 'Cause, I swear to God, I will.
-Why can't we leave it in the bag? -Because it shows up on the scanner.
And we're not about to have them confiscate $250,000.
$250,000?
-No. Why do I have to do it? -'Cause you're the donkey boy.
You really suck at not asking questions.
What's a donkey boy?
-Step forward, sir. -Thanks.
-In the basket, please. -There's a table when you get to the line.
Act casual, think casual, be casual.
Remove your keys, any metal objects. Laptops out, please.
Thank you.
If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag, please show them to us now.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
Your boarding pass.
Sir?
You forgot your bag.
Thanks.
Nice going, Campbell.
Hey, Ben. Basic strategy says you should hit that.
Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,
Mona, Miss Sommers, your new identities are on the bar.
So glad you could make it.
Vladimir Stupnitsky?
Yeah. Your dad's a diplomat with the Russian consulate.
You live in Washington, D.C.
Your hobbies are backgammon, chess and long walks on the beach.
-I don't like my name. -Why not?
"Sierra Sommers." Do I look like a Sierra?
Well, you have a lot of clever outfits. You'll figure it out.
Just pretend you don't speak English. Then you don't have to change your hair.
You know, I thought this was legal. Why do we have to use fake names?
Well, it is. We not only use fake names, we use disguises.
It's for the benefit of the dealers to make sure you're old enough to gamble
and it allows everyone to be different people in different casinos.
Hey! You steal the Bible, you go to hell. That's the way it works.
Like I'm not going already.
Yeah. All right. Now, listen.
Ben, this is for you. All the casinos have cameras in the ceiling.
They're called "eyes in the sky."
For their benefit, order a tonic water and lime and act a little drunk,
and at all times, you don't know each other.
Let me say that one more time, you do not know each other ever.
And what's our motto?
-Don't get caught counting. -Don't get caught counting.
Thank you very much.
How come you don't play?
Oh, I did. I played for a long time and I was the best. But I'm retired now.
Take my advice, Ben, it's always best to go out when you're on top.
Welcome to Vegas.
No more bets.
All right, here we go. Big money, now. Big money.
Let me tell you about blackjack, honey. You ever hear of basic strategy?
Oh, see, now that sounds really complicated.
-I'm Sierra Sommers from Charleston. -Pleasure.
Here to double my family's inheritance.
I don't know.
$10,000.
Changing $10,000.
Sweet. Too sweet.
Eight. The count's still plus 16.
Ten. That's minus one.
Count's plus 15.
Eight. Still plus 15.
Nine. Plus 15.
Five. The count's 16.
Eights. Split eights.
Can I split those?
-Sir, please don't touch the cards. -I'm sorry.
Jack. Count's plus 15.
Ten. Plus 14.
King. Nine. Plus 13.
Jack. Plus 12.
Nine. Still plus 12.
Blackjack.
Monkey! Monkey!
-So what's a monkey? -Face card.
All right, face card. Come on, monkey. Okay, monkey.
Monkey!
Monkey! Come on, give us a monkey!
Monkey! Come on, monkey, monkey, monkey! Monkey.
Monkey! Monkey!
All right, all right.
Oh, God.
I need to quit.
Could I color up, please?
Nice undies.
-What's this? -It's last night's take.
We split it five ways.
So, what do you think?
Yeah, it was fun.
-You were good. -Really?
Yeah. Came in quick off the count. You acted the part.
You weren't afraid to play big, and you got out when you were supposed to.
And you made more money than Fisher.
I was pretty nervous, actually.
You know, but after a while, it felt kind of easy.
Not for everyone.
Yeah, it's just simple math.
Good. We can do some serious damage with you.
Here's the thing I told Micky.
You know, I'm only really doing this just to pay for medical school.
You know, $300,000 and then I'm out.
That's what they all say.
No, really, I mean, I'm just doing this to pay for Harvard.
It's just a means to an end for me.
I believe you.
Good.
-Hello? -We have a team meeting in five minutes.
Team meeting.
Hello?
-Hey. -Hey.
Where's everybody else?
I don't know. Fisher was right behind us.
Oh, Fisher, you didn't sleep.
-I did. With Ida. -Ida?
She's a dancer. I pulled her out of Sapphire.
-And Ida's her dancer name? -Yeah. After her grandmother.
Where's Kianna?
Slots.
-Choi, where the hell you been? -Unattended maid cart, ninth floor.
I've been busy this morning.
All right, guys, let's get something clear.
This is not summer camp and I'm not your counselor.
This is real, world-class moneymaking business.
Kianna, slots are for losers.
Fisher, peelers are stealers.
Choi?
You made five grand last night, so would you stop stealing nine-cent pens
and everything you can get your hands on from the maid's cart? It's embarrassing.
But, Fisher, what the hell were you up to last night?
What?
Three separate occasions, the spotters let you know that the deck was cooling,
but you kept on anyway.
You either lost the count or you lost your head.
In either case, I don't wanna see it happen again.
Jill, nice disguise last night.
And Ben, good work. You came out of that chute like a pro. Keep it up.
Beginner's luck.
Hey, Fisher. Win like a man, lose like a man.
Micky, I didn't play into a cold deck three times.
You know what's worse than a loser?
Someone who won't admit he played it wrong.
Take it up with Ida.
Who's Ida?
-Who the hell is Ida? -Shut up.
-Who the hell is Ida? -Shut up.
There goes that paycheck.
-Money plays. -Money plays, up to the limit.
How's she doing?
Oh, that doesn't matter, man.
The way I see it, yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery.
It's all what you do in the moment, baby.
Just lost another property.
Who is it this time, Caesars or the Mirage?
Caesars.
That was a 14-year account.
-They opted to go with the new software. -I know, Terry, I know.
Hey, Cole. We got absolutely murdered in pits four and five the last couple of nights.
Okay, Clark, I'll take a look at the tape.
By the way, you wanna lose the cigarette?
There's no smoking in here, you know that.
I appreciate it.
End of an era, my friend.
Ben. Time for school.
I seem to keep waking up to you.
Don't get used to it.
I'm glad you came over this morning.
-I have something I wanna give you. -Oh, yeah?
I want you to have this.
What's this?
That's a lot of money.
I've been saving for a long time. It's for medical school.
I know it won't pay the whole way, but it should help.
Ma, I can't take this.
This is your money. You worked hard for this.
For precisely this reason. I wanna help pay for med school, Dr. Campbell.
Well, you know what? You don't have to.
'Cause I got the Robinson Scholarship.
Yep, they're gonna pay the whole way.
Why didn't you tell me?
Well, because I wanted it to be a surprise.
And actually, I just found out today.
I can't believe it! Oh, my God!
This is amazing. I am so proud of you.
-I knew the hard work would pay off. -Yeah, I know.
So, listen, you keep this, all right? It's yours.
What are you doing?
I'm just jumping up and down on my bed.
What? You never did that when you were a kid?
-No. Not really, never. -No.
Right.
All right.
So where were you this weekend? I tried calling you, like, 15 times.
Oh, yeah? I ended up having to go to New Hampshire
to help my cousin move.
You didn't bring your cell phone?
Your cell? Your phone? You didn't bring that?
No, I forgot it. I ended up leaving it here. So, you know.
Yeah, well, you missed a hell of a dorm party on Saturday.
Oh, yeah?
We almost had a girl there.
-Republik? -Yes.
Let's do it!
She is an eight.
-No way. She's a 7.649. -I was rounding up.
Hey, I thought we agreed we weren't gonna round up anymore.
That's right.
But if we win the 2.09, I'm asking her out.
Wait. Ben? Ben, you only owe eight bucks.
Hey. Can I get you a beer?
-Sure. -Yeah? Okay.
Excuse me. Can I get two Bud Lights, please?
Thanks.
-How you doing? -I'm okay.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Thank you.
Are those your friends over there?
No. No, I've never seen them before in my life.
Could you just excuse me for one second?
Guys, I'm serious. What are you doing? You're staring.
Yeah, we know.
Yeah, well, can you not?
I think it's gonna freak her out a bit, don't you think?
Yeah, I got a feeling we're a little more freaked out than she is right now.
So how do you know her?
Did you, like, take some self-help seminar or something?
What?
-Jedi mind trick, huh? -Jedi mind trick. Like that Luke.
-You will drink beer. -Right. Right, right.
There is a fortune on the table now, and it's all up to my dad.
It's getting ridiculous.
He actually needs to stop the table play, track down my uncle and take a loan.
-No, are you serious? -Yeah.
They let him, and he does.
He ends up with, like, two 19s and two 20s.
The dealer turns over a 17.
It's soft. He needs to take another card.
No. Don't say a four. Is it a four?
-It's a four, yeah. -It's a four. My God.
Not a great Christmas that year.
So, what does he think about what you do? Does he know?
Oh, no, he's long gone, Ben.
My dad's gone, too.
I'm sorry.
So, you know, when you came into the store to ask me to join the team,
was that because...
What?
Well, you know, was it because Micky asked you to?
Look, we've had three classes together.
You gave that presentation on combinatorial algorithms
that nobody understood.
You're the smartest person in every single one of those classes, Ben.
That is why you're on the team. And that's why I came into the store.
No, no, not so much...
-Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry. -No. It's fine.
-It's not a problem. -I don't know why I just did that.
-Don't apologize. -Are you sure?
Yes. Shit, this is my stop.
-You're getting off here? -Yeah, I've gotta get off.
But, really, don't worry about it.
I don't know, it's just 'cause we've been drinking, and...
It's just we're on a team, we work together.
-I get it. -Just don't feel bad about this.
Okay. Sure. Bye.
My world was flashing by at a million miles a minute.
I had saved over $100,000.
Only $200,000 to go.
But there was still one thing I couldn't get off my mind.
The moment we left campus,
the concept of vectors and formulas
were replaced with counting, shuffle tracking
knowing when to hit and knowing when to color out.
I was becoming a pro on all levels.
I made more money in one trip to Vegas
than I would have in 5 years, 9 months, 12 days and 6 hours
at J. Press Menswear.
In Boston, I was just Ben Campbell.
But in Vegas, I could be anyone I wanted.
You know what I'm gonna do? You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna throw a half-mill down on the one hand. Come on. Hit me!
One night, I'd be the high-rolling heir to a pharmaceutical fortune.
Leon, could you make sure there's some champagne,
maybe some strawberries waiting in there for me.
I may not be alone.
The next, I'd be the hottest video game designer on the West Coast.
There it is.
Winner, winner, chicken dinner!
No, please, keep going. This video's priceless.
I'm not gonna lie.
It did get, well, a little confusing sometimes.
Operator, how can I help you?
Yeah, room service.
Excuse me? Honey, we don't do room service.
What do you mean, you don't do room service?
I mean, we don't do room service.
In Boston, we had a secret.
In Vegas, we had a life.
Micky said I was gonna have more fun than I could possibly imagine.
And he was right.
-Hey, Jamie. There you go. -Nice.
It was too good to be true.
There you go. All right, my night just got better. Thank you, Joe.
And it felt like it was never going to end.
Clark? I think I got something over here.
Take a look at this.
That guy? He's a kid.
He was on the tape from last week.
Got a big roll and he's crushing your table.
Plus, he ordered a tonic and lime.
Tonic and lime. What does that mean?
It means he wants you to think he's drinking.
Okay. So is he counting or is he just getting lucky?
He's not running a progressive system.
He doubled on 10 when the deck was heavy,
but he didn't on 11 when it got lighter.
-How can you tell if it's heavy or light? -I'm counting.
You...
Tell me something, Cole, if you can count that well,
why are you still consulting for us?
I've been asking myself the same thing.
Let's just say I like being on your side of the hustle.
Bring up a frame of that for me on the printer.
So, Terry, I heard you guys are losing a lot of work
to that biometric facial recognition software.
Just gives us a little bit more time to focus on you guys.
-That's impressive software. -I know.
Here he is.
I still think there're bigger fish to fry out there.
So do I.
Hey, Fisher.
He's mad at me and jealous of you.
But don't worry. Greatness evokes that reaction sometimes.
-Don't worry about it. I gotta go. -All right.
-Hey. -What's going on?
He just didn't like the subject I chose for my final paper.
-That's bullshit, Ben. -What?
I know when you're lying, I'm your best friend.
At least I thought I was.
Are you on drugs, Ben?
Because there's a group that meets at Simpson Hall on Saturdays.
No, no. Cam, I'm not on drugs, okay?
I'll go to the meeting if you need me to.
Why didn't you tell me you quit J. Press?
I don't know.
-Is it Jill Taylor? -No.
What about Harvard?
It'll find a way of working itself out.
-Look, I gotta go. I'll see you. -Ben.
I think the worst part of it was not being able to tell anyone.
But for the first time in my life, the world made itself easy for me.
Here you go, sir.
And I liked it.
That's for you.
We just made $210,000.
Yes.
Now, Ben, this is how we play!
And play we did.
Nothing cost too much.
Nothing was out of reach.
I guess you could say the casino host of fate
gave Ben Campbell a major upgrade.
Dorm rooms turned into high-roller suites.
Bicycles became stretch limos.
No, no!
And college bars that were always filled with frat dudes were upgraded to,
well, something more interesting.
-Hey, baby. Where you in from? -I'm from Boston.
-On a convention? -No, business, actually.
What line of work you in, mister?
I count things.
My name's Sierra.
Hi, Sierra. I'm Salvador Sanchez.
Would you like a private dance, Salvador?
Well, that all depends on how much it's gonna run me, Sierra.
$20 a song, 30-song minimum.
Sounds expensive.
-Good evening, Mr. Klein. -Hey, Frank. It's good to see you.
Jeffrey, you're taking my money.
You are so lucky you're cute.
'Cause if you weren't cute, I'd leave. You know that?
Jeffrey. My brother from another mother.
How you doing? You good?
I'm good, I'm good, Mr. K. What, are you back in town for business?
It's all business in this town, right?
Well, with your money, I'm sure it always is.
Oh, damn, I forgot my ring.
Oh, please.
I don't wanna bet that. That's for keep.
$100,000 going out.
Thank you, Jeffrey.
-Cole. Your boy's back. -Yeah.
-That's him, right? -There he is.
And he brought a whole lot more money with him.
That is a hell of a suit, by the way.
-That is some aftershave he has going on. -Sir, could you not? Please.
This girl's only betting the table minimum. Why's she keep looking at him?
Terry, rewind the tape. I wanna see if she signals him to come to the table.
We don't use "tape" anymore, old school. It's digital now.
Never mind. Terry, rewind it.
Okay, okay.
She's playing the table minimum.
Now, in a second, she's gonna do something.
She's gonna raise her hand, scratch her head... There it is.
That's the signal. See? She gave him the signal.
He comes to the table. I'm telling you, they're working together.
Nice.
Show me a computer that can do that.
You look familiar.
I know you, don't I?
-I don't think so. -No?
Oh, sure, you look exactly like that guy in Rain Man.
Oh, yeah? Well, people say I look like Tom Cruise all the time.
Oh, yeah? No.
The other one, the... What's his... The retard.
I just love that scene in Vegas when the retard wins at blackjack.
You look just like that.
What I could never understand, though, is how someone so retarded,
could win so much.
Hey, Jeffrey, his brother from another mother,
how did that retard win so much?
-You know what, sir? I think that maybe... -Okay, get your hands off me.
Oh, I didn't mean it.
His luck'll run out eventually. It always does.
-Hey, Ben... -No, Ben, stop it!
-What the hell is the matter with you? -Hey, come on! Ben!
Oh, you think that's funny? You think that was funny? Shut up!
I understand, Ben. We don't need anymore...
This is not the time. Okay?
I want to thank you for confirming my choice in Ben.
Now go home.
-What? -You're off the team.
No.
-I was drunk, I was... -I don't care what you were.
I'm not leaving.
Yes, you are.
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
You've been the big man for a long time, but you just acted like a child.
So I want you to pick up the ticket and go home,
because if you don't, you know exactly what I'm capable of doing,
don't you?
All right, listen up.
Casino's gonna change out their chips,
just like the MGM did after the Tyson fight.
That means we got less than 24 hours to cash in,
or we're gonna be sitting with 200 grand of worthless plastic.
-So we'll cash out. -It's too hot.
They're gonna be dissecting the eye in the sky footage of Fisher's little power play.
So let's do it right now before they can do that.
Are you deliberately slow?
What about them?
What about them?
They can cash in the chips. The casino's just gonna think they're tips.
-Cashing out. -Thank you.
-Thank you. -Thanks, sweetie.
-Thanks, hon. -Thank you, baby.
I love a parade, don't you?
You know, there's a word I don't throw around all that often,
"Genius."
Hey, Kianna. Let me hold your bag for a second.
Thanks, baby, here.
Oh, no problem. Anytime.
-Watch. Watch, watch. Ready? -Okay, I'm watching. That's beautiful.
Watch. No, it's great, you just need to get your knee a little higher.
No, it's great, you just need to get your knee a little higher.
-Hi. -Hey.
So the Hard Rock comped me a suite.
That's cool, that's great.
You wanna see it?
All right, take care, Bobby. All right?
God, it's cold.
Hey, what time is it?
He's only 45 minutes late. Show a little patience.
Oh, look. Here he comes.
Guys, I'm sorry I'm late.
Hey, Ben.
You know, you could try returning a call once in a while.
Good of you to show up, man. It's not like we're cold or anything.
Yeah, funny.
-Hey, did you bring it? -Yeah, I got it. There it is.
And you're sure you didn't inlay the software on more space
than the parameters suggest?
No. It's just one-fifth of the free face.
Let's fire this mother up.
Beautiful.
Okay.
Okay.
What's happening?
-I don't understand. -It's the wrong size.
No. What?
-What the hell, Ben? This is an 8K. -Right.
Yeah, we needed 16K!
-I can't believe this. -I thought it was an 8K.
-No, you didn't. -Yeah, I did.
No, you didn't. You knew the entire time the discrete was 16K.
Damn it, Ben.
It's gonna take us two weeks to get a fresh 16K from the fabrication.
And another five days, minimum, to get it ready to press.
Miles, calm down, all right? It was an honest mistake.
What?
You know what? I think we're gonna have to go at this without you, man.
You're gonna what?
No, no. This is just as much mine as it is yours.
We've been working on this for over a year.
I know that. But your heart just isn't in this anymore.
Are you serious?
Fine.
Fine.
You know what? I don't even care. Honestly, I don't even care.
You know why?
'Cause no one in the real world gives a shit about the 2.09 Competition.
You know, it's just something that you build up in your head
to make yourselves feel important.
You guys are pathetic.
Thanks.
Welcome back, Mr. Youngman.
-Thanks, Joseph. It's good to see you. -Good to see you, too.
-Good evening, Mr. Zach. -Welcome back to the Red Rock.
Nice to see you.
Anything I can do for you, let me know.
Double down.
I guess you play big or you don't play at all.
Right?
Honey, there you are. Let's go. We don't wanna miss the show!
Honey, we're actually playing a game here.
Yeah.
Yeah, so you know what?
Why don't you run upstairs and wait for me there? Okay?
All right. Let's go.
Yeah, all right.
I've got the worst headache right now.
-Ten. -Come on, monkey.
-Fourteen. -Come on. Come on, monkey.
-Sixteen. -Monkey. Come on.
Twenty-one.
Pete, you're killing us.
I guess it's not my night.
Are you out of your mind?
I don't know what happened.
I messed up. I'm sorry.
Oh, you're sorry.
Well, see, now that's what I've been waiting to hear, Ben.
As long as you're sorry.
I'm out 200 grand, but Ben's sorry! Everybody hear that? Ben's sorry!
So we can all go back to being friends and laughing over cocktails!
Come on, Micky. It can happen to anyone. They get on a rush and they lose control.
You shut your mouth. This is business.
Hey, I let you down, all right? I get it.
Excuse me? You let me down? I don't care!
Let me make one thing clear to you, I am not your father!
You are not my friend. This is a business.
You are only as good to me as the money you make,
and, right now, it's not worth a hell of a lot!
You're gonna give me back everything you lost.
I can't do that! That money was for Harvard!
I have made you so much more than what I just lost!
It doesn't matter, Ben.
You had very clear instructions, and you didn't follow them.
You didn't do your job. You weren't counting, you were gambling!
Well, why aren't you out there, then, Micky?
I mean, we take all the risks. Seems to me like you don't do shit.
This isn't about me,
you arrogant little infant.
You can all find your own way back to Boston.
And, Ben, you're gonna pay me that money,
every penny, one way or the other.
And you damn well know it.
I need a drink.
Anybody else?
Yeah, well, we don't need him.
-Yeah, okay, Ben. -No, I'm serious.
Why do we need him? We have our own money now.
You know, his cut was 50%, and he doesn't even play!
Why do we need him?
Hey, you know what I think?
I think we play out the weekend, and I think we do this without him.
No. No, I don't think that's a good idea.
I think we should go back to Boston and figure this out.
Yeah, well, why don't we let the team decide?
I'm with Jill. This is Micky's thing. Micky brought us together.
And then he drove us apart.
I mean, you saw how he played Fisher against me.
Choi, what do you say, man? You wanna make some money?
-Kind of. -Really?
We need 100 grand just to play.
You're talking about risking our own money.
All I'm saying is that we try it. You know?
If we make the investment, then we take all of the winnings.
All of it.
Okay.
Yeah.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Choi?
I'm in.
Now I need a drink.
-What are you doing? -What?
What are you doing?
Well, we're printing money.
What, you think just 'cause Micky left that we're gonna stop?
No, I could do this. I can lead this team.
You know, I'm not the same guy I was back in Boston.
-Exactly. -Yeah, exactly.
You know, isn't this exactly who you wanted me to be
when you first came into the store to buy a tie?
What happened to "$300,000 and I'm out"?
What happened to "a means to an end"?
-How much do you have? -What?
-How much do you have? -I got enough.
Come on, Ben. How much do you have saved back in Boston?
I've got 315 grand, all right?
Then why are you still here?
Because I wanna still be here. I like being here.
So does everybody else.
So come on, Jill. Are you in?
You are the big player, Ben.
Yes, I am.
Yeah, can I get a drink?
Rose, I wanna thank you.
You have been most accommodating.
All right, that's for you.
Okay, take care. Hey, good luck.
Hey, how we doing here, people?
Yeah, I'm gonna put you on hold while I track him down.
Just got an interesting call.
There's nobody left to fire us. Planet Hollywood is our last client.
I don't know about that.
This is Cole.
Queen of diamonds. Your lady luck tonight.
You're doing good.
You're a real winner.
Sometimes. Just like everybody else.
Now, why don't I believe that?
Maybe you're just smarter than everybody else, huh?
Yeah, I bet it's been that way your entire life.
Except it just recently started paying dividends, am I right?
I'd split them.
Deck's heavy as hell and since I've been here, the true count's at plus 7.
Kianna. I think we have a serious problem over there.
-Walk now! -Oh, shit. Oh, shit!
Let's go. I'm out. Thank you. Let's go, Jill. Let's go.
I think we need to call security or something.
Yeah, I don't think they're gonna help. Let's go! Come on.
Let's take a walk, huh?
Come on, kid. See if we can't get you that chicken dinner.
It's called Biometrics.
Biometrics. It's sort of like a fingerprint of your face.
See, when the player sits down at the table, the software, it reads this...
Biometric profile.
...biometric profile of your face,
cross-references it with a database of counters.
Software'll probably put you and me out of business, but it still can't do this.
All right.
You understand all this. You go to MIT.
Smart boy.
My name is Cole Williams.
And if I ever see you in this town again,
I will break your cheek bone with a small hammer,
and then I will kill you.
Please. Please just take the money.
You can take it.
Tell me,
how's good old Professor Rosa doing, huh?
Oh, yeah. Me and Micky, we go way back.
I spent years, chased him all over this town.
Giving him beat downs left and right, only to find him at the tables a week later.
He was very persistent.
And then, one September night,
when I was in Barstow at my father's funeral,
my casino was taken for seven figures.
Can you imagine that?
The most ever taken by a single counter in one night.
'Course I was, naturally, unceremoniously fired.
Funny thing, though.
I never saw Micky Rosa after that.
Never.
Cauchy was the first to make a rigorous study
of the conditions for convergence of an infinite series.
And was concerned with developing
the basic theorems of the calculus as rigorously as possible.
Any questions?
No? All right, moving on.
Isn't it true Cauchy stole from his students?
Yes, I heard that. What's your theory on that?
They say he used his students for their brilliance,
then discredited them and stole their equations,
stole their hard work.
Well, that wouldn't be the first time a teacher was accused of that.
I think what he's referring to is Vladimir Stupnitsky, yes?
He was a student of Cauchy's who accused Cauchy
of stealing his four-volume text on this analysis
and publishing it under a pseudonym.
Of course, nobody knows what really went down there.
They never did prove it, and without the proof, it's a little like it never happened.
And, you know, it's a real shame,
because if Stupnitsky had just realized that he shouldn't have crossed Cauchy,
this was the dispute,
if he'd been able to get beyond some of the personal mistakes that were made,
I have no doubt that Cauchy would have worked with him again,
and they could have done great things together.
But, as history shows us, some students never learn.
You should get that eye looked at.
You okay?
Everything's gone.
-What? -Micky's taken everything.
He's taken the money, taken away Harvard Med, even MIT.
-What are you talking about? -Micky, he's taken everything.
I gotta find a way to get it back.
Are you insane?
You just got the shit kicked out of you and you won't let this go!
Look, what am I supposed to do, Jill? I've just lost everything!
Look, please...
I don't want to lose you, too.
Ben, you were dragged away in Vegas.
I haven't heard from you. I had no idea where you were.
I know.
I know.
You know, I'm so sorry that I hurt you.
I'm sorry.
In Vegas, I don't know what happened. That wasn't me.
Look, you know me.
You know what I'm like.
You know me.
I just... I need you to trust me.
And the winner of this year's 2.09
for excellence in the field of robotics goes to the team of Conolly and Kazazi!
That's it. That's the story.
Jill Taylor. Really?
-Yeah. Yeah, really. -Wow.
Yeah, it doesn't feel like "wow," Miles. I really screwed up.
Yeah, you did. But you had a life experience.
I can't believe how I treated you, Miles.
You know, you're my best friend, and I really let you down.
I really let you down. I'm sorry.
And I'm happy for you, you know? Winning the 2.09? That's great.
-Jill Taylor. Really? -Yeah.
So let me get this straight.
Money, girls,
high-roller suites, clubs, Vegas.
Yeah, I think I probably would have blown off the 2.09 Competition, too.
So we cool?
Yeah, we're cool.
But you better believe that you're gonna make this up to me, big time.
All right.
So, what are you gonna do now?
What do you want, Ben? This is an alumni dinner.
You need a diploma to come to one of these.
Wait. Stupnitsky wants back in.
What?
Look, I've had some time to think about what you said.
I want back in.
-Why now? -Because I have nothing else.
All right, look, Ben. I'm not gonna lie to you.
You're good, you're very, very good. But you did exactly what I told you not to.
You got emotional and then you got stupid.
Now you tell me why in the world I'd ever get back in business with you.
Look, I know I should never have disrespected you, all right? I know that.
With this facial recognition software,
our window of opportunity is closing in on us.
Now, I need this, Micky. I really, really need this.
Well, the take would have to be really, really good
to get me even vaguely interested.
Well, you know, that's why I was thinking maybe you should be the other big player.
You know, two big players playing big?
Hey, slow down, I haven't played in a long time, Ben.
But Fisher's out.
No one else on the team can be the big player, can they?
And if we do well, if we do really well,
then you get your grades back, get to Harvard Med,
and I might even get that sabbatical.
Well, amazing things can be done from the inside, right?
Just went back to the head of the class.
I gotta go be social.
All right, now listen. It's different out there this time.
The stakes are high and it's more dangerous.
But the return is gonna be the biggest.
Now they know our faces, so we're gonna wear disguises.
And we can't mess around.
I'm glad you're back with us, Micky.
Well, I couldn't let you guys come back to this town
and not prove to Ben that I can do more than just teach.
But as we've all said, this game is about the past and the future,
and tonight we forget about the past.
We just focus on the future.
Right. This is our last time.
Now, we all know the drill if things get ugly.
We meet at the Fox Strip Club. Nobody leaves this town alone.
Let's go make a killing.
All right.
Let's see what we can do with this.
Seems like I'm having one of those days, you know what I mean, Jim?
I'm bringing all the luck today. I'm just bringing it all.
Anyone who's in any kind of contact with me is getting so much luck today.
Winner, winner, chicken dinner! There it is.
Thank you. God, I love this town. I love this game.
And, Jim, I might even love you.
Hey, you mind if I sit down?
What's your name?
Shane? I'm about to change your luck. It's gonna become mine.
There you go, give me it all.
There you go.
Thank you. Thank you.
Such a shame, Shane!
Okay, I'm supposed to double, right?
-Is this your first time, darling? -I've been winning and losing for hours.
Well, that's all right. I've been winning and losing for years.
What the hell kind of streak are you on, boy?
This never happens, this never happens.
Nice.
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.
-Splitting tens. -Splitting tens!
-Split tens! -Again!
-Thank you, ma'am. -Give me the chips, Blanca.
Give me the chips! Come on, give me the chips, Blanca.
Come on, just give me the chips!
-My bus has to leave right away. -I gotta walk my dog.
-I'm sorry we're making such a mess. -Go, go, go, go, go.
Nice to see you. Have a good night, darling.
This way!
Go.
This way!
Come on, Jill. Come on!
Go that way. Throw me the chips. Come on, we gotta separate.
Give me the chips, I'll meet you at Fox's.
Go, go, go, go!
Come on, come on.
Move, move, move!
Come on.
Go, go, this way.
All right, let's go.
Go, go, go, go! Airport!
I never saw Micky Rosa after that.
Oh, God.
But I think I wanna see him now.
And I want you to make that happen.
I don't work for Micky anymore.
Come on, kid.
Your picture's all over the database. Your Vegas gig is done.
But I will give you one night.
And I can guarantee that you won't be bothered.
You'll make a killing, and you'll keep it all.
Listen.
My name's Cole.
Cole Williams.
You just bring me Micky Rosa, kid.
I'll take care of the rest.
Son of a bitch.
Who the hell are you?
Ben. Good job.
You'll be glad to know I'm gonna have a talk with your professor,
and that MIT thing?
It's gonna work out for you.
So that's it?
-That's it. -All right.
Oh, Dr. Campbell?
They don't have pensions in my line of work.
And the software does what it's supposed to do.
And I've been chasing Micky Rosa around here for too damn long.
I'm looking at some retirement.
Leave the bag.
No. No, no, no, no.
I need this money. You have no idea what I went through to get this money.
I know, kid, but you're gonna figure out how to get everything you want in this life,
'cause you're smart.
So, you're gonna leave the bag.
Ben, give him the bag. Give him the bag. It doesn't matter. Give him the bag.
I knew you were smart.
I had a 1590 on my SAT.
I got a 44 on my MCATs.
And I have a 4.0 GPA from MIT.
I thought I had my life mapped out.
But then I remembered
what my Nonlinear Equations professor once told me,
"Always account for variable change."
Hello, Micky.
Look, I got money in Boston. A hundred grand.
I'll give it to you. Just let me walk away. I'll walk away.
I don't want your money, Micky. I don't need it.
But I know someone who might be interested.
He's good with numbers, too. He works for the IRS.
I let down my good friends.
But as it turns out, they weren't too bad at simple math either.
I scored the prettiest girl in school.
I got beaten down by an old-school Vegas thug
who was having trouble accepting his retirement.
But I worked out a deal with him that got him a nice pension.
And I lied to my mother.
But I confessed the lie, and, well, she still loved me.
So my senior year of college, I joined this team.
And I learned this new skill.
I went to Vegas 17 times to use it.
I made hundreds of thousands of dollars counting cards.
And then I had it all stolen from me.

the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.
Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen,
after the lawsuits and negative publicity,
when the company is finally getting back on its feet again,
where is the wisdom in putting the Good Guy back on the market?
Mr. Sullivan, before this happened...
the Good Guy outsold all our other toys two to one.
Even now, interest in the marketplace is at its peak.
The factory is up and running again.
We should be in stores by next week.
We cannot let the fantasies of one disturbed boy...
influence company policy.
Well, what if the doll somehow... affects another child in a negative way?
You could have a public relations nightmare on your hands.
You know, one of the hardest things about this business is...
that it is a business.
Doesn't matter what we're selling,
whether it's cars, nuclear weapons... or yes, even toys.
The bottom line is the bottom line.
And what are children, after all, but consumer trainees?
Andy Barclay is ancient history.
No one remembers him. Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind. We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
Okay. All right.
Mr. Sullivan,
if there's nothing I can say to convince you,
then I must go on record with my position. I'm completely against this.
Your position is crystal clear, Miles.
And you can be sure I won't forget.
Uh, just a minute, folks, please. Mr. Sullivan, we have a little surprise for you.
Mr. Sullivan, we have a little surprise for you.
Guys at the factory sent this over and we all wanted you to have it.
It's the first one off the assembly line-- the Good Guy of the 90's.
Well, if there's nothing else, I'm gonna get going.
Fine.
It's just, my wife's expecting me.
It's our anniversary. Fine, Petzold.
Well, I-- I guess I could review the Larrabee report after dinner.
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.
Good night.

Come on. Let's go. Come on! No, wait--
Let's go! Stop! What about Charles?
This means war.
What the hell?
- I like to be hugged. - Aah! Jesus. [ Chuckles ]
Aw, you gotta be fucking kiddin' me.
The man lives through two tours in Nam...
and then one night he just drops dead.
Doesn't make any sense.
[ Shelton ] At ease.
We will now take a moment of silence to honor Colonel Cochrane.
He was a fine man, and he will be sorely missed.
Bow your heads for prayer.
[ Shelton ] Take... seats!
It's gettin' pretty shaggy, Carlson.
I want to see you on Friday. Yes, Sergeant.
Monday, Fabrizzio. Yes, sir.
My man.
[ Groans ] Tuesday.
Look at you, Whitehurst. You're a disgrace.
When's the last time you had a trim?
Two weeks ago, Sergeant, I think. You think? You think?
I want to see you right after breakfast. You got it?
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.
And what are you looking at, new boy?
Wednesday.
Barclay, what're you doing?
You can't just get up in the middle of mess.
Major.
- At ease! - [ Laughing Stops ]
Tyler. Hi, Barclay. What's up?
I've got to talk to you about Chucky. You mean Charles.
Have you seen him?
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.
He's gonna lay low until he knows you're alone. Then he's gonna come after you.
He just wants to play. Listen to me.
He just wants to play. Listen to me. No matter what he says, no matter what he promises you,
No matter what he says, no matter what he promises you, you've gotta stay away from him.
you've gotta stay away from him.
Don't let him fool you. He's bad.
Charles isn't bad. He's a Good Guy. It says so on his shirt.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler. Believe me, he's bad news.
He's hurt a lot of people. I think Colonel Cochrane was one of them.
You're just jealous 'cause he's my best friend now instead of yours.
Look... you better keep this.
Whitehurst, you are, without a doubt,
the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever disgrace these walls.
Face it. You're not cut out for this life.
Why don't you do yourself a favor and get the hell out of Kent?
If I had any choice in the matter, I would, sir.
Smart ass.
Presto. You're bald. [ Chuckles ]
[ Sniffs ] Yeah.
What the hell?
How'd you get in there?
That haircut ain't regulation, soldier.
When's the last time you had a trim, huh?
Kiss it good-bye.
Presto. You're dead.
It's definitely you.
I just forgot my --
The annual war games...
have been an unbroken tradition here at Kent for over 50 years.
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believed in the value of tradition.
He not only would have wanted us to go on,
he'd have ordered us to go on.
Therefore... the war games... will proceed as scheduled. [ All ] Hoo-aah!
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton... will command the blue team.
Major Rawlings will head up the reds.
The objective is simple--
to capture the other team's flag, bring it back here safely to base.
bring it back here safely to base.
Rawlings.
You will pick up your weapons in the armory before moving out.
You will be using the standard issue Springfield aught-three.
Your ammo.
Shelton.
If you get hit, you are dead. Hike back to base.
Hike back to base.
Commanders... take charge of your teams.
May the best team win.
Good luck, men and women.
Nice of you to join us.
Looks like Botnick's in a pretty bad mood today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong. I'm fine. Nothing's wrong.
This oughta slow the pricks down.

[ Instructor, Cadets Continue Chanting ] What's going on, Whitehurst?
You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.
Don't wimp out on me now, Whitehurst. I need your help.
That kid needs your help. I didn't see anything.
That kid needs your help. I didn't see anything. Okay? I didn't see anything at all.
Okay? I didn't see anything at all.

Your military left.

Ellis, let's make sure all the perimeters are secure. Yes, sir.
She checks all the windows.
And the babysitter hears this thump, thump, thumping,
like something's being dragged across the floor upstairs.
Then suddenly she thinks, "I haven't checked on the children."
So she hurries to the top of the stairs,
and when she gets there...
she sees her boyfriend completely dismembered,
dragging himself across the floor by his chin.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide. [ Boy Groaning ]
Thump, slide.
[ Ivers ] That was gross.
Hey, you guys, I got a better story. And it's true.
It's about this mental institution... and it's a few miles away from here.
Hey.
Hope it wasn't something I said.
[ Chuckles ] No. I'm sorry.
De Silva, where do you think the red team's camped out?
Could be anywhere. Shelton'll find 'em. He always does.
By the way, you can call me Kristin.
What? Kristin.
It's my first name.
Do you have one? Andy.
Oh.
Come on, Andy. I want to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
I almost forgot there are places like that...
where people just go to have fun.
[ Twig Snaps ] Listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a chipmunk or something.
Nothing scares you, does it?
No.
Man, I really got to get out of this body.
I'm going after Tyler.
Are you crazy? You'll never find him. Wanna bet?
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before we pitched camp.
The red team is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck, Whitehurst.
Are you with me or not?
I'm sorry. I can't.
[ Ellis ] Up and at 'em, ladies. We're movin' out.
I want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes.
I thought we weren't going until dawn, sir.
Someone stole the reconnaissance map out of the colonel's tent, so we're making our move now.
so we're making our move now.
Get going, Hanley.
Whitehurst. You wouldn't know anything about a missing map, would you?
Where the hell's Barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you better have a look in here, sir.
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone AWOL, sir.
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's doubling for the reds.
Where's Tyler? He went AWOL with some guy named Charles.
Where's Andy?
Whitehurst, where is he?
[ Shelton ] Platoon, halt!
All right. De Silva, you're gonna take the right flank.
Siegel, take the left. Check in on the radio every five minutes.
Yes, sir. All right, move it.
The rest of us are gonna spread out and meet up with Ellis at Split Rock.
Move out.
Whitehurst, move!
Thanks for coming after me. What are friends for?
Duck!
That was a close one.
Now we can play "Hide the Soul."
I'm tired. I don't wanna play that dumb game anymore.
You're a fuckin' drag. You know that?
- Watch your mouth, Charles. - Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier is always prepared, Tyler.
Barclay was right. You're not a good guy.
[ Chuckles ] Sorry, kid. You got me.
I'm bad.
Now, assume the position.
- No! - Aaah!
Get back here!
Barclay! Barclay!
Tyler!
You fuckin' traitor. Give me my map!
Listen to me, Shelton-- You got any idea what we do to traitors, Barclay?
Tyler's in trouble. Come on, Whitehurst. Back me up.
Major Ellis, call in the flanks. Yes, sir.
De Silva, Siegel, do you copy?
De Silva, do you copy?
[ Radio: Ellis ] De Silva, come in.
Siegel's on his way back. No word yet from De Silva.
Siegel's on his way back. No word yet from De Silva. Well, keep tryin'. Yes, sir.
Well, keep tryin'. Yes, sir. Help! Help! Tyler!
Help! Help! Tyler!
Help! Help! Tyler! Barclay! Are you okay, Tyler?
Barclay! Are you okay, Tyler?
Well, looks like we got ourselves a little P.O.W. You were right.
Well, looks like we got ourselves a little P.O.W. You were right. Charles is bad. He tried to hurt me.
Charles is bad. He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell's Charles?
[ Radio: Chucky ] Come in, Barclay. Come in.
- Who the hell is that? - It's Charles.
Who is this? Put Barclay on, jarhead.
[ Ellis ] It's the reds. They're up to something.
What do you want? I want the kid.
What do you want? I want the kid. Bring him up to the old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay.
Bring him up to the old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay. [ De Silva ] Andy, don't do it. De Silva!
[ De Silva ] Andy, don't do it. De Silva!
You hear that, Barclay? Don't touch her, you son of a bitch.
Now bring me the kid, or I'll waste her.
Red Team, Red Team. Come in, Red Team.
This is Red Team. Over. We got a situation up here at the old Jeep.
Blue Team sighted. Advise you to move your troops in.
Hope they like the taste of lead.
Now just sit back and watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two are gonna go on up ahead, draw 'em out.
The rest of us are gonna circle around. Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.
Relax, Barclay. It's only paint.
All right, let's do it.
I'm scared, Barclay.
Yeah, me too.
All right, kid. Get over here!
No! Don't fuck with me!
Don't fuck with me! I'll blow all of you to pieces.
I'll blow all of you to pieces.
Beat it!
Now just get down and shut up.
Yeah!
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
De Silva, where the hell is everybody?
Hi, soldier. [ Cackling ]
[ Chuckles ] Fuck me.
All right! [ Cackling ] [ Gunshot ]
Shit! Stay down!
[ Gunshots ] Jesus. They're using live rounds!
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire! [ Chucky Cackling ]
Oh, God, he's not breathing! Get away from him!
You did this, didn't you? You sick son of a bitch.

You'll have to come with us now, son.
Are you gonna be okay?

capable of great compassion
and great violence.
For in our quest to protect the humans,
a deeper revelation dawns.
Our worlds have met before.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER 1: Newsflash from the BBC. MALE ANNOUNCER: Breaking news out of Shanghai.
There's been a major toxic spill in the Shanghai factory district.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER 2: We're staying on top of this developing story for you.
We will bring you any new information as we get it.
WOMAN: NEST Seahawks approaching target.
SOLDIER: Three minutes until evacuation is complete, sir.
Chinese airspace has been locked and sealed, one-mile radius.
All right, give NEST team the go.
Black Hawks, you're clear to land.
Ding-a-ling! Come out and get your ice cream.
Any bad robot out there better get ready for an ass-whupping.
OPTIMUS: For the last two years, an advance team of new Autobots
has taken refuge here under my command.
MAN ON PA: Arcees, get ready to launch.
We're locked and loaded.
OPTIMUS: Together, we form an alliance with the humans,
a secret but brave squad of soldiers.
All right, listen up. China's cover story on this one is "toxic spill."
They had to evac the area for search and rescue.
This makes six enemy contacts in eight months.
We gotta make sure this one does not get out in the public eye, so keep it tight.

We hunt for what remains of our Decepticon foes
hiding in different countries around the globe.

All right, Ironhide. We got echoes. Vamos.
Steel stacks at 2 o'clock.

Did you rent the room out? No, I got other ideas for your room
and it rhymes with "home theater."

-You can't go. -You see this, Dad? This is how
-You can't go. -You see this, Dad? This is how you're supposed to react when the fruit of your loins
goes out into the cruel world to fend for himself, okay?

You have to come home for Halloween. Well, I can't come home for Halloween, Mom.

Well, I am, okay? So, there's no reason for me to come say good-bye to you.

Yeah, I got you a webcam, so we can chat 24/7.
All Witwicky, all the time.
And I got you  a couple souvenirs from the event
that cannot be mentioned on cell phones.
Some mixes and candles and stuff.
Sounds cute. I can't wait.
Hey! You want the infamous D-Day shirt?
You kept your nasty, shredded clothes?
Yeah. Of course, I kept it, Mikaela. It's like my Super Bowl jersey. I bled in this thing.

No, it's not that.
It's just that my low self-esteem's at an all-time high.

You really should come with me. They got cheap apartments near campus.
Well, that's not gonna happen until I get my man-child father,
fresh out of prison, back on his feet.
I heard that. Where'd you put the clutch covers?

and you forced me to say it, it won't mean anything, plus
you haven't said it either. So, don't get mad at me for not saying it.
Yeah, but I haven't said it because guys always run when you say it first.
So do girls. Especially girls like you, with options.

General, our alliance has countermanded
six Decepticon incursions this year,
each on a different continent.
They're clearly searching around the world for something,
but last night's encounter came with a warning.
DECEPTICON ON RECORDING: "The Fallen shall rise again."
"The Fallen." Meaning what?
OPTIMUS: Origin unknown. The only recorded history of our race
OPTIMUS: Origin unknown. The only recorded history of our race was contained within the AllSpark
and lost with its destruction.
Excuse me!
With this so-called AllSpark now destroyed,
why hasn't the enemy left the planet like you thought they would?
Director Galloway, our National Security Advisor.
The President just appointed him liaison.
Well, I guess I didn't get that memo.
GALLOWAY: Forgive the interruption, General.
Excuse me. Coming through.
Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.
After all the damage in Shanghai,
the President is hard-pressed to say the job's getting done.
Now, under the classified Alien/Autobot Cooperation Act,
you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.
We've witnessed your human capacity for war.
It would absolutely bring more harm than good.
But who are you to judge what's best for us?
With all due respect, we've been fighting side by side in the field for two years.
We've shed blood, sweat and precious metal together.
Soldier, you're paid to shoot, not talk.
Don't tempt me.
GALLOWAY: And the newest members of your team.
OPTIMUS: Easy. GALLOWAY: I understand they arrived here
after you sent a message into space,
an open invitation to come to Earth, vetted by no one at the White House.
Let me stop you right there, Mr. Galloway. It was vetted right here.
And in my experience, the judgment of both Major Lennox and his team
has always been above reproach.
Well, be that as it may, General, it is the position of the President
that when our national security is at stake,
no one is above reproach.
Now, what do we know so far?
We know that the enemy leader,
classified NBE One, aka Megatron,
is rusting in peace at the bottom of the Laurentian Abyssal,
surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.
We also know that the only remaining piece of your alien AllSpark
is locked in an electromagnetic vault
here on one of the most secure naval bases in the world.
SOUNDWAVE: Decepticons, we have located the shard.
And since no one can seem to tell me what the enemy is now after,
well, there's only one clear conclusion.
You! The Autobots!
They're here to hunt you.
What's there to hunt for on Earth besides that?
"The Fallen shall rise again"?
It sounds to me like something's coming.
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude that our national security is best served
by denying you further asylum on our planet,
will you leave peacefully?
Freedom is your right.
If you make that request, we will honor it.
But before your President decides, please ask him this.
What if we leave and you're wrong?
That's a good question.
(BELL RINGING) Oh, my gosh! Look at this place.
Oh, my gosh! Look at this place.
I feel smarter already.
Ron, can you smell it?
Yeah, smells like $40,000 a year.
Hey, cheapo.
Hey, go ahead. We'll get your stuff.
Just go ahead and check out your room. Yeah, go.
-Hey. -Hey.
-You must be Sam, right? -I'm Leo.
Hey.
So, I already set up the crib a bit. You want this side or that side?
-That side. -I already chose that side.
You know what this is? This is the awkward moment.
Yeah, see, you're trying to see if I'm a normal guy. I'm trying to see if you're a normal guy.
Balanced, unmedicated, nothing under the crawl space.
Good hygiene, won't stab me. No criminal record, won't steal anything.
-Including girlfriends. -Especially girlfriends.
-You got a girlfriend? -I do. You?
(LAUGHING) No, not a chance. You a techie?
Sweet! Sharsky, Fassbinder, where we at?
FASSBINDER: Server's almost online, Leo. SHARSKY: Network's up and running.
Beautiful, that's what I like to hear.
That's Sharsky, that's Fassbinder, my IT gurus.
Welcome to my empire, bro, TheRealEffingDeal.com.
That's me, I'm sure you've heard of it.
-No, I haven't. -Well, that sucks.
-What is all this for? -LEO: See where I'm going, bro.
Look, call me gross, I want to be a baby billionaire.
Kitten calendars. That's where I started. Look at me now.
Got to have dreams, bro.
Leo! We got some brand-new Shanghai vid.
Post it, baby. Go, go, go! FTJ! FTJ!
What's "FTJ"?
"Fuel the Jet." Fuel the Jet, bro.
FASSBINDER: FTJ. FTJ, legit!
Did you see that? Did you see that?
Look at this. Half of Shanghai gets wrecked and China says "gas leak."
Don't believe the hype, bro.
SHARSKY: Just like the alien robots in LA two years ago that everyone covered up.
Yeah, I saw these robots, and they did this, like, firing thing
and they came down and toasted this woman, and she was like...
-It looks fake to me. -FASSBINDER: Dude, it's not fake.
The Internet is pure truth. Video doesn't lie.
-It looks fake. -No, man, I've seen them.
They're, like, these robots... Look, look, it's fake.
Anybody could do it on any computer, okay?
And I wasn't there,
so I can't comment or speculate.
-No. -"Comment or speculate"? And we're supposed to cohabitate?
No, listen, okay? Don't be sucking the sack, bro.
-Which sack? -The ball sack.
Dude, what kind of tool are you?
Mainstream media sack. They're lying to us, all right?
-It's aliens, man. -Okay, okay.
Follow me.
Uh-oh! Leo, bad news.
We just got scooped. The video's already up on GFR.
Fassbinder!
(GRUNTS) Robo-Warrior, the guy's our main competition on conspiracy stuff.
"Effing" was my F-ing idea and he stole it.
He's been linking to my site and thieving hits forever.
By the way, I read your file. I'm poor, you're poor.
We're gonna fix that, all right? You work for me now.
I work for you now? That's incredible.
It's first day of college, I got a career in a dinky Internet firm
with a boss who is made up of just pure champion stuff.
Are you mocking my life's work, Samuel? That's your one warning patrolling, dude. Don't make me
That's your one warning patrolling, dude. Don't make me have Fassbinder hack your financial aid, 'cause I'll do it.
Hey, RA. Listen, it's getting a little intense in my room. Can I switch out?
Sad face, 312. No switching, no trading.
Sad face, 312. No switching, no trading. Let's turn that frown upside down, okay?
Oh, here we go. We made it. Hi. It's just like Hogwarts.
-Hi. -Is this co-ed?
-This is a co-ed dorm. -You guys want -to meet my roommates? -JUDY: Yeah.
Some real swell guys. -Here's Leo. -We're the Witwickys.
-I'm Leo. -I'm Judy.
Hey, you have a great son, you really do.
Well, aren't you the sweetest thing?
Yeah, he's real sweet, Ma. What is that in your hand, by the way?
I got this at the bake sale for the environment
that those boys are having.
You know, you don't often see white boys with the dreadlocks.
-Mom? -Yeah, it's 100% pure,
Hawaiian green for the environment.
Hawaiian green for the environment. -How many have you eaten? -Drop it.
-How many have you eaten? -Drop it. -SAM: What is this? -Yeah, they baked it with reefer.
-No, it's... -Please, give me...
Hey! It's my cheat day. I can eat what I want.
I'm going to freak out. Please do something right now, Dad.
Please do something right now.
I can eat all the fricking brownies I want.
Come on, let's go. I'm sorry and you're welcome.
We call it the "Hot Freshman 55."
Sharsky hacked Campus Housing and stacked the dorm with pretty Betties.
Is... Is so nice...
Oh, my God. That's her. She's coming. She sees me, she sees me.
She's tied for number one on my to-do list.
Do not bird-dog my quail, you hear me?
Pretty girls! Hey, you. My son lives in this dorm.
You should go make friends with him. He's Sam.
MALE STUDENT: Glad she ain't my mama.
And he recently had his cherry popped.
(ALL GIGGLING) He didn't know I was in the house. I heard it all.
-Hey, hey, hey! -Here he is.
He would get in my closet and dress up as Boy Spice.
Hey, and his car is a talking robot!
No, like the GPS. OnStar!
-OnStar. -JUDY: Frisbee.
(JUDY WHOOPING) No, Dad. Dad, you just gonna let her run around the school?
Give it. Mine, mine, mine.
MAN: Hey! Crazy!
You want it? I want it.
Judy, Judy, just... Just put it down.
-You gotta control your mother. -I don't know who this woman is.
Hey, Professor, I'd do anything for an A.
All right, Grace Slick. We got some snacks in the car.
Let's go. Did you get the booties? All right.
Yes, Dad, I got the booties! I'm upside down.
(GROWLING)
Black Lion X-Ray, this is Black Lion Tango.
We have activation of motion sensors on the western perimeter fence.
(ALARM BLARING) MAN ON PA: Breach at B-14.
Go, go, go, go!
SOLDIER: The shard's gone.
Contact!
SOLDIER 1: Take it down!
SOLDIER 2: Which way? SOLDIER 3: Shoot left.
Knock it down.
First frat party's the game changer. Boys, we're hunting in the wild now.
So, get your game faces on.
I can't stay long. I have a webcam date with my girlfriend.
-That's so cool! -No, it's not.
While he's making out with his MacBook,
I'm gonna be getting my Spitzy freaky freak on.
Let's roll. She's hot.
Bro, we're hunting.
-See you, darling. -Bye, Dad.
Okay.
This is our first live chat date. I've never done it before.
I'm kind of nervous.
-GIRL: Are you okay? -No.
I was getting a napkin for my drink.
Thanks. Cheers.
-It's Sam, right? -Yeah.
I wanna dance.
What, like... Like dancing?
Like a pairing? Like a duo? Like a coupling?
'Cause I'm in a permanently semi... I'm in a relationship, kind of...
Relax. I just want to have some fun.
Wanna have some fun?
Yeah, okay. Let's play some checkers. You can sit over there and...
Oh, my...
So, how about tonight you pretend I'm your girlfriend
and I pretend that you're my boyfriend?
Hey! Who drove the freaking yellow Camaro?
There is a car on the lawn
What are you doing?
MAN ON RADIO: Houston, we have a problem.
-What is it? -FRAT GUY: Freshman!
-Yeah? -Is that your car in our bushes?
No, there's a friend of mine. He just went to get you a tighter shirt.
There isn't a tighter shirt. We checked.
Now how about I park my foot in your ass?
-What size shoe do you wear? -Yeah?
-Hold on. -FRAT GUY: You wanna try?
SAM: I'll back it up right now. Get him out of here.
You have a ride? Bro, why are you holding out on us?
I've only known you 17 hours.
LEO: This is gonna really change our lives. You have no idea.
I love Camaros.
I can't do this right now, okay?
-Don't be a wimp. -Oh, God!
My first car was my dad's '92 Z28.
Yeah?
Fuel-injected. The roar of the engine, it just tickles me.
The roar of the engine, it just tickles me.
We shouldn't stare...
I mean, share stories with each other at all.
Come on, Sam. Just one ride.
MAN SINGING ON RADIO: ♪ Your cheatin' heart ♪
Don't. Don't!
♪ She's a super freak, super freak She's super freaky ♪
Is your radio broken?
No, my concentration is.
We're not cheating.
Not yet.
Is something wrong here?
(BOTH SCREAMING) God! You okay?
♪ She's mighty, mighty ♪ I really don't know what to tell you.
This car has a lot of problems. A lot...
Oh, God! It's in my mouth!
Are you okay? I got Wetnaps.
I got Wetnaps for your face. Hold on.
I... I'm so sorry.
What are you doing?
You won't give me a day, huh?
You won't give me one day in college?
I'm sorry, Sam,
but the last fragment of the AllSpark was stolen.
Like what? Like Decepticons stole it?
We placed it under human protection at your government's request,
but I'm here for your help, Sam,
because your leaders believe we brought vengeance upon your planet.
Perhaps they are right.
That is why they must be reminded by another human of the trust we share.
This isn't my war.
Not yet... but I fear it soon will be.
Your world must not share the same fate as Cybertron.
Whole generations lost.
I know, and I want to help you, I do,
but I am not some alien ambassador, you know?
I'm a normal kid with normal problems.
I am where I'm supposed to be.
I'm sorry. I...
-I really am. -Sam, fate rarely calls
-I really am. -Sam, fate rarely calls upon us at a moment of our choosing.
You're Optimus Prime. You don't need me.
We do, more than you know.
U.S.S. TOPEKA, SSN - 754 ON RADIO: Conn, Sonar. Gained new contact, bearing 214, and possible hostile,
confirmed for Project Deep Six Drop Point.
What do you got? SU pulled five contacts at 5,000 feet,
SU pulled five contacts at 5,000 feet, diving fast.
Never seen anything dive that deep that fast.
Man battle stations.
Chief of the watch, man battle stations.
Helm, left full rudder, all ahead two-thirds.
Left full rudder, two-thirds. CHIEF: Dive, go deep.
The nets protecting NBE One are screaming, sir.
That is 9,300 fathoms down. And no confirmed DSRVs on site?
-None, sir. -Then we've got a problem.
Need parts. Kill the little one.
The shard make Energon.
Conn, Sonar. Now hold six contacts, and they're coming up fast.
Sound collision alarm. SOLDIER: Left hard rudder.
Five hundred feet.
Angel Six, we got six hostiles coming up.
Collision imminent port side. One hundred feet.
Brace for impact.
Starscream, I'm home.
Lord Megatron, I was so relieved to hear of your resurrection.
You left me to die on that pathetic insect planet.
Only to help spawn our new army. The Fallen decrees it!
After all, in your absence, someone had to take command.
So disappointing.
Hatchlings. Hatchlings. Careful, fragile!
Even in death, there is no command but mine.
My master, I failed you on Earth.
The AllSpark is destroyed and without it, our race will perish.
You have much to learn, my disciple. The Cube was merely a vessel.
Its power, its knowledge, can never be destroyed.
It can only transform.
How is that possible?
It has been absorbed by the human child.
The key to saving our race now lies within his mind.
Well, then, let me strip the very flesh from his body.
And you will, my apprentice, in time.
For millennia, I have dreamed of my return to that wretched planet
where I, too, was once betrayed by the Primes I called my brothers.
Only a Prime can defeat me, and now, only one remains.
Optimus! He protects the boy.
Then the boy will lead us to him
and revenge will be ours.
Yes.
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.
Without more Energon, the hatchlings will keep dying.
Space. Time. Gravity.
Thank you. Finish that for me.
We're going on a journey together, you and I, today.
All you eager, nubile, young minds on the very cusp of adulthood.
And I shall be your consort, your guide,
your chaperone, into the heart of darkness.
Welcome to Astronomy 101.
For what do we know about the stars?
Virgo, the virgin.
Orion, the great hunter.
These are no mere twinkling diamonds for lovely maidens to wish upon.
No, they are dynamos
filled with a throbbing, savage and pent-up energy.
Behold the work of Albert Einstein, a professor once, like moi.
-Energy equals mass... -What you doing?
LEO: Put your hand down. Put your hand down.
Young man, there are no questions
until I've reached the climax of my lecture.
I just finished your book and there's a problem. Einstein's wrong.
(STUDENTS LAUGHING) Energy does equal mass times the velocity of light squared in this dimension, but what about the other 17?
of light squared in this dimension, but what about the other 17? We haven't even talked about the other 17.
Clear example.
Break down the elemental components of Energon,
assume a constant decay rate and extrapolate for each of the...
Fourteen galactic convergences it took the Sentinel Prime expedition to receive an... Echo on its signal,
the Sentinel Prime expedition to receive an... Echo on its signal, you wind up with a formula for inter-dimensional energy increase
you wind up with a formula for inter-dimensional energy increase that mass and light alone can't possibly explain.
Come on, guys, I can't be the only one in the class who...
Young man, I will not be punk'd in front of the Dean.
(GASPS) No, this is my universe here.
Do you understand? I am the alpha and the omega.
-Get out of my class. -Yes, sir.
Anyone else care to have some sort of mental breakdown?
Hi, Bones! Hi. Hi. Oh, you're such a good boy.
(DISTORTED) What a good boy, you are.
Hey, Bones. Are you hungry?
There you go.
(SIGHS) -Yes, Samuel? -Hello? Mikaela?
I can't believe you're gonna stand me up on our first web chat date.
Something just happened to me, okay?
What, you finally hit puberty?
No, no, no. Stop laughing. This is serious. Okay.
Remember I was telling you about my great-great-grandfather, Archibald Witwicky? Remember?
Watch it, watch it, watch... No! Okay, remember how I was telling you...
Okay. Can you stop? Watch the foot. Watch your foot.
Mikaela, okay, my great-great-grandfather went on this Arctic mission, right?
And he saw Megatron. Megatron zapped him,
and he started seeing these crazy symbols. Okay.
Well, now I'm seeing them, too. Excuse me.
I just read a 903-page astronomy book in 32.6 seconds.
I had a meltdown in the middle of my class.
I am seeing symbols ever since I...
Since what?
Ever since I touched the Cube splinter.
Do you have it?
MIKAELA: Yeah, I have it. It's in the shop safe. It's fine.
Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?
-Don't touch it. -I'm not gonna touch it.
Sam, it's fine. It's locked away. No one knows where it is.
WHEELIE: I do.
You're hot, but you ain't too bright.
There we go. Yeah, that'll work.
Ow! Damn it! Son of a bitch!
What are you looking at, slobber puss?
What the... This place is a freaking house of horrors.
Pain... It hurts...
Hold on.
Right to five, then...
Is that the best you got, huh? Is that the best you can do?
What are you doing here, you little freak?
Ow! That's my eye, you crazy bitch!
You gonna talk now?
I seek knowledge from the Cube.
-The Fallen demands me! -What knowledge?
You got the shard, I need the shard. Give me the shard. I need the shard.
I'm gonna be dead without that shard.
Easy, warrior goddess, I'm just a little salvage-scrap drone.
And I'm your worst nightmare. Hey, hey, hey.
-What the hell was that? -I'll tell you later,
just not on an open phone line, okay? I'm gonna get on a plane right now
and I'll be there later this afternoon. Just be careful, Sam.
And have any strangers given you anything suspicious to carry on today?
WHEELIE: Yeah, a live bomb!
-No. -Good.
Major, incoming SOS from Autobots!
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity, eastern United States, sir.
As in how many?
Unclear, sir.
Well, get clear.
The Autobots are on the move, splitting into two teams, sir.
They're not answering our calls and they're heading to New York and Philadelphia.
Full weapons deployment. Wheels up in 20 minutes!
Move it!
Let's go!
PILOT ON PA: Flight 57, welcome to Philadelphia.
LEO: Alicia, mi amor, can I interest you in an 18-inch Zookeeper's special?
Extra-large, triple cheese, with every known animal as a topping.
Basically, I've got, like, 18 inches of meat.
Unless you're vegetarian. All right. It's cool. I am, too.
-Sam home? -Sam? I think he died,
but why don't we check?
-Here we are. -SAM: Hey. You ever have a song stuck in your head? It's like
You ever have a song stuck in your head? It's like the worst song ever, but you can't help to whistle it or sing it
'cause it, like, repeats itself, repeats itself, repeats itself, repeats itself?
repeats itself, repeats itself? Kitten calendar, kitten calendar, kitten calendar,
Kitten calendar, kitten calendar, kitten calendar, -kitten calendar... -Dude, what the eff?
-kitten calendar... -Dude, what the eff? I know you're freaking out. Don't freak out. Don't freak out.
Easy fix. Puzzle code in my head.
Now it's on the walls. Everything is good.
This is the part that...
(SHUSHING)
Okay, what were you saying?
Alice, I'm horrified you had to see this. Let's go.
ALICE: Get out.
Wait, wait, wait! Can I just sit and watch?
I'll... I'll eat my pizza quietly.
Sam, I knew there was something special about you.
Really?
And I know you know what happens
when two people in the know get together.
They're genuinely amazing in bed.
Thank you.
All right, listen, hold on! Boundaries. Flag on the play. Okay. I'm very ticklish.
We have needs, Sam. Relax.
Jeez!
What about this economy? It's crazy, isn't it?
You are very aggressive.
Just relax.
You want some turkey meatloaf?
Sam?
Mikaela!
Is that your girlfriend?
-Mmm-hmm. -Ex.
Mikaela! Wait!
(ROARS) I can explain... (CHOKING)
Sam, your bed buddy, Alice...
All right, come on. She's coming.
She's an alien robot. You gotta move.
-LEO: Is this real? -Just run.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I can't believe I almost had sex with her in my dream!
I can tell that you really missed me a lot, Sam.
-Look, it's not my fault, okay? -It's not your fault?
Listen! Listen, I'm a victim.
-You were a victim? Of what? -Yeah.
-Of what, little 80-pound girl? -Of... Of molestation.
It was like getting humped in the neck by a mountain ox.
You didn't have to put your tongue in her mouth.
-I didn't! Look! -You did!
You ever had your stomach tongued by a mountain ox with a five-foot tongue?
It's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela? And it smelled like... Like diesel!
Like a diesel-y tinge to it. You're such a little girl.
We're gonna have 10 seconds of silence right now. I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds.
You can't give me the silent treatment! You know what?
I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds. You have three seconds left.
You know what? You can give me the silent treatment all you want, but you can't keep me from talking.
-What were you gonna say? -I hope you had a lot of fun,
because this, this is over.
She violated your orifice with her nasty alien probe?
She did it? She went in there? All her little embryo alien babies are gestating and hatching inside of you.
All her little embryo alien babies are gestating and hatching inside of you. They're growing right now, probably.
You need to vomit it right now. Yak it. Yak it right now.
-Who are you? -Leonardo Ponce De Leon Spitz.
-Who are you? -Leonardo Ponce De Leon Spitz. Okay? I'm the key to this.
The aliens, they want me 'cause of my site.
Whoa, guys, right there. (STUDENTS SCREAMING)
SAM: Run.
Mikaela!
Come on. We gotta move.
MALE STUDENT: It's a bomb!
You've got to get that box.
This way. WHEELIE: What? Hey. Let me out, let me out.
Oh, my God, you know how to hot-wire a car? That's so hot.
Drive, drive, drive. She's right there. She's right there!
Come on, come on, come on.
Go! Go! Go! Back up the car.
Now.
Tongue.
Oh, my God!
Kiss this, bitch!
SAM: Drive, drive, drive.
Okay, so what else don't I know, all right?
Since you guys forgot to mention some minor details.
That thing you saw back there, that was the little baby... (BOTH SCREAMING)
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Sam!
Sam!
-Sam! -LEO: Hold on!
-SAM: Pull me up. -Hold on!
MIKAELA: Sam, get back in!
LEO: I don't want to die. We're gonna die. Oh, my God!
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Jesus! Jesus!
Come here, boy.
Closer.
-Oh, my God. -SAM: Okay.
MEGATRON: You remember me, don't you?
I did what you said, okay? Just don't hurt us.
I did what you said, okay? Just don't hurt us. Shut up!
(SCREAMING) Sam!
MEGATRON: Yeah. Yes, yes.
It feels good to grab your flesh.
I am going to kill you slowly, painfully,
but first, we have some delicate work to do.
MEGATRON: How I could snap your limbs off.
Doctor, examine this alien specimen.
I'm the doctor. The odd job. Information.
Yeah!
Easy or tough way?
MEGATRON: There they are.
SAM: That's what I'm seeing in my head. MEGATRON: These symbols can lead us to the Energon source.
DOCTOR: We must have the brain on the table.
-Chop, chop! -Brain?
What does he mean by my brain?
Well, you have something on your mind, something I need.
Hold on. I know you're pissed. I know you're pissed
because I tried to kill you and it's completely understandable.
If somebody tried to kill me, I'd be upset, too.
I think that we have an opportunity here
to start anew and develop our relationship
and see where it leads us, okay?
So, you just call Doctor Inspector off and let's just talk for five seconds.
Wait, wait, wait!
LEO: Come on! Go, go! MIKAELA: Sam!
Go, go, go!
OPTIMUS: Sam!
LEO: Run!
Go, go, go, go!
SAM: Here he comes.
OPTIMUS: Hide, Sam.
Weak.
Puny. Waste of metal.
Junkyard crap.
MEGATRON: Decepticons.
Come here, boy.
MEGATRON: There is another source of Energon hidden on this planet.
The boy could lead us to it.
Optimus!
MEGATRON: Is the future of our race not worth a single human life?
Up. Get up!
You'll never stop at one.
I'll take you all on.
Piece of tin.
Sam! Where are you?
No!
MEGATRON: You're so weak
The last Prime is dead.
Sam, run. Run.
IRONHIDE: Autobots, attack!
Bumblebee, get them out of here.
This is Lennox.
MEGATRON: That went well.
STARSCREAM: We've lost the boy, Master.
The Autobots must be shielding their signals.
I can't even rely on you to swat a simple insect?
One insect among seven billion.
MEGATRON: Shut up.
He could be anywhere.
Then we will force them to find him for us.
It's time for the world to know of our presence.
No more disguises. No mercy.
The time has come for my master's arrival.
Decepticons, mobilize. It is time.
JUDY: Speaking French is so exciting.
Oh, God, who is this?
Hello? I mean, bonsoir!
What? Who is this? SOUNDWAVE: Where is the boy?
For Pete's sakes. I'm not impressed with your perverted mouth-breathing.
Jeez!
You are invading my space. I'm gonna have to drop you.
Would you get out of here?
RON: I didn't come all the way across the ocean to eat a plate of snails.
I want to try new things.
Looks like Canadian goose poop.
It's nasty.
Revenge is mine.
Yeah!
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: ...definitely not a plane...
MORSHOWER: Look, carriers don't just sink.
...a horrible accident or a terrorist attack or worse...
Negative. NORAD confirmed,
projectile came from beyond our atmosphere, inbound at 30,000 knots.
(STATIC HISSING) Citizens of the human hive,
your leaders have withheld the truth.
You are not alone in this universe.
We have lived among you, hidden,
but no more.
As you've seen, we can destroy your cities at will,
unless you turn over this boy.
If you resist us, we will destroy the world as you know it.
MALE ANNOUNCER 1: What we're hearing from the German government
is that the world broadcast was a satellite hacking.
MALE ANNOUNCER 2: The military has just told us they have assumed Condition Delta,
has just told us they have assumed Condition Delta,
which is the highest level we have been at since 9/11.
President Obama is being flown to a bunker
somewhere in the middle of the United States
in the face of the worst simultaneous attacks ever around the globe.
The aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt
goes down off the East Coast, all hands lost.
Worldwide casualties are in the neighborhood of 7,000,
but that number could climb.
It's still too early to tell.
What we need to ask now is, "Who and why?"
MALE ANNOUNCER 3: The FBI is still trying to locate the boy, Sam Witwicky.
We believe they have information about the attacks.
The FBI, CIA and Interpol
are all seeking the cooperation of worldwide law enforcement.
are all seeking the cooperation of worldwide law enforcement. LEO: You need to listen to this, man. You gotta check this out.
MALE ANNOUNCER 4: They have a traffic-camera spotting...
They have a picture of me, man. We're dead, bro.
FBI, CIA, we are wanted fugitives now.
I just need you to focus for one minute, man.
-Just stop. -This thing has blown up to a whole other level, all right?
Give me this thing. They can track us.
-Do you see this? -What?
They can track us? Like, satellite track us?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Okay, I'm not even with you guys!
Technically, I'm like a hostage. This is kidnapping...
-Enough is... -MUDFLAP: Yo, Leo!
This thing's gonna give me a heart attack, I swear.
That's 'cause you is a wuss. You guys forced me into that car, right?
I think he's scared.
Hey, Mudflap, what are we gonna do with this shrimp taco?
Hey, Mudflap, what are we gonna do with this shrimp taco? Let's pop a cap in his ass, throw him in the trunk
and then nobody gonna know nothing, know what I mean?
-Not in my trunk. -Bumper cars? I'm hearing you.
Okay? I'm right here and I can hear you.
No one's popping any caps in any asses, okay?
I've had a hell of a day.
Why don't you get a haircut with your bitch ass?
Go whine to your boyfriend.
Listen, Sam, I know what I'm gonna do, man.
Go to the authorities and tell them the truth. I had nothing to do with this.
Hey, you wanted this, right? You wanted the real deal? That's what this is.
Wake up. You're in the middle of it!
You want to run? Go ahead! No one's stopping you.
Stop complaining.
RATCHET: What is the meaning of this?
You dare point a gun at me?
You want a piece of me? I will tear you apart!
Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!
-Tell them to lower their weapons. -Tell them first.
Tell them to lower their weapons. Major, there's nothing I can do. Talk to him.
Your NEST team is deactivated, Major.
You are to cease anti-Decepticon operations
and return to Diego Garcia pending further orders.
No, we take our orders directly from Chairman Morshower, sir.
Well, I'll see your Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and I will raise you a President of the United States.
I have operational command now.
An alien blood feud has been brought to our shores
for which our soldiers are paying the price.
The secret is out.
This is our war now and we will win it as we always have,
with a coordinated military strategy.
This fool is terribly misinformed.
You're gonna need every asset that you've got.
What we need is to draw up battle plans
while we explore every possible diplomatic solution.
Like what, handing over the kid?
All options are being considered.
Whatever the Decepticons are after, this is just the start.
There is no negotiating with them. I'm ordering you to stand down.
You won't be needing this anymore. Get your assets back to base.
And take that pile of scrap metal back to Diego Garcia.
Let's go.
I really don't like that dude. He's an asshole.
MAN ON PA: Autobots, report to hangar for transport.
Ironhide, we should leave this planet.
That's not what Optimus would want.
There's nothing that you could have done.
-You okay? -Yeah.
Bee, if you hate me, I understand.
Bee, if you hate me, I understand. (WHINES)
I messed up. I'm sorry.
Young fella, you are the person I care about most in my life.
If there's anything you need, I won't be far away.
He's dead because of me. He came here to protect me and he's dead.
There's some things you just can't change.
So, his sacrifice for us would not have been in vain. Hallelujah!
I'm gonna make it right. I'm going to turn myself in.
We... We've got to stick together.
You're not going to do that.
Yes, I am.
BUMBLEBEE: Everything we worked for will be wiped out in one day
-You two... -BOTH: Huh?
Hey, you know the glyphs?
These? The symbols that have been rattling around in my head?
That's old school, yo. That's, like... That's Cybertronian.
That's some serious stuff, right there.
They gotta mean something, like a message or like a map.
Like a map to an Energon source.
Can you read this?
Read? No. We don't really do much reading. Not so much.
If you can't read it, we gotta find somebody who can.
Look who came sashaying back.
Hair growing like a Chia Pet. Look at him.
I had a bit of a mild panic attack earlier, right?
That's 'cause you're a pussy.
I think I'm allowed that, considering what I've been through.
I heard you have a problem.
I think I know someone who can help.
-Who? -Robo-Warrior.
LEO: This guy, Robo-Warrior,
everything about anything alien, he's supposed to know.
One time we revenge-hacked his site
and maybe I saw some of your alien drawings or whatever.
This is it. Yep.
-Deli. -Good front
All right, wait here. I'll give you the go/no go. All right?
Number 42, we got your kishka, knish,
kasha-varnishka and kreplach combo right here.
Cash only. Who's next?
I told you to cure the lox in the brine and then smoke it.
Ma, you want me to cut my hand off, or what?
You... You ruined a beautiful piece of fish, you retard!
You... You ruined a beautiful piece of fish, you retard! I'm like a ninja with a blade. It's an art form.
I'm like a ninja with a blade. It's an art form.
Give me your money. Get out of here. Hey, Sal. Watch your reach, huh?
Take a number, young man.
Robo-Warrior.
Know him?
I never heard of him.
You never heard of TheRealEffingDeal.com?
You must be talking about that amateur-hour blog operation
with Game Boy-level security.
Robo-Warrior.
It's him. It's him. That's the guy right there. That's him.
No.
You got to be kidding me. All right, meat store's closed.
Everybody out. Out, right now. WOMAN: When he says to go, you go.
That means you, lady, right now.
Wait a minute. You know this guy? -We're old friends. -Old friends?
-We're old friends. -Old friends? You're the case that shut down Sector Seven,
got the kibosh, disbanded.
No more security clearance, no retirement, no nothing.
All 'cause of you and your little criminal girlfriend.
Look at her now, so mature.
Moron. Where's the whitefish?
Hey! Don't touch me with the pig.
-SIMMONS: Yakov. -What?
You don't get Christmas bonuses standing around.
You want those new teeth you saw on SkyMall?
It's my dream. Help her out.
-You live with your mama? -No, my mama lives with me. It's a big difference. They got your face all over the news,alien boy.
It's a big difference. They got your face all over the news,alien boy.
-Yeah, I know. -And NBE One's still kicking?
How did that happen? Don't answer.
I don't know what you're hiding, but I don't want anything to do with it.
So, good-bye. You never saw me. I got bagels to schmear. Vanish.
Can you give me five seconds? Look, hold on, I need your help.
Really? You need my help?
I need... Look, I am slowly losing my mind.
Okay, I had a little crab-bot,
plunged a device deep into the soft tissues of my brain
and started projecting little alien symbols like a freaking home movie.
And on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive. So, you think you got it rough?
You said it projected images off your brain?
Right. Meat locker, now.
LEO: Dead pigs. MIKAELA: Yuck.
What you're about to see is top secret.
Do not tell my mother.
LEO: Swine flu. Not good. SIMMONS: Now you know.
Next time you eat a goat or a pig, there's a story behind it.
Sad little story.
TV: An entire city flat. How do you explain that?
Are you saying you believe in aliens?
SIMMONS: Okay, files, files. We're talking about symbols.
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.
Okay, Cube-brain.
Any of these look like the symbols you saw?
Where'd you get these?
Before I got fired, I poached S-7's crown jewel,
over 75 years of alien research, which points to one inescapable fact.
The Transformers, they've been here a long, long time.
How do I know?
Archeologists found these unexplained markings
in ancient ruins all over the world.
China. Egypt. Greece.
Shot in 1932.
These the symbols you're seeing in your head?
Yeah. Same ones over here, right?
So, tell me, how did they end up all drawing the same things?
Aliens. And I think some of them stayed.
Check this out. Project Black Knife.
Robots in disguise, hiding here all along.
We detected radioactive signatures all across the country.
I pleaded on my knees with S-7 to investigate it,
but they said the readings were infinitesimal,
that I was obsessed.
Me. Can you imagine that?
Yeah. Megatron said that there was another Energon source here.
-On Earth. Another source? -On Earth.
Okay? And that these symbols, maps in my head, would lead him there.
You talk to your Autobot friends about this?
No, no, no, the source is before them.
Whatever the Energon source is, it predates them. It's before them.
-So, it comes before them. -Correct.
Well, then we're porked, unless we can talk to a Decepticon.
I mean, I'm not on speaking terms with them.
Actually, I am.
WHEELIE: Let me out.
This is going to be a little bit sad. Open it.
(EXCLAIMING) I will have so many Decepticons on your butt.
Hey, behave.
-What is it, a Decepticon? -Yeah.
-And you're training him? -I'm trying to.
I spent my whole adult life combing the planet for aliens,
and you're carrying around one in your purse like a little Chihuahua.
Do you want a throwdown, you pubic 'fro-head?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry about your eye, you know,
but, if you're a good boy, then I'm not gonna torch your other eye.
Okay? I'm not gonna torch it.
Just tell me what these symbols are, please.
All right. I know that. That's the language of the Primes.
I don't read it, but these guys...
Where the frick did you find photos of these guys?
-Is this they? -Yeah. Seekers, pal.
-Is this they? -Yeah. Seekers, pal. Oldest of the old.
They've been here thousands of years, looking for something. I don't know what.
looking for something. I don't know what. Nobody tells me nothing, but they'll translate those symbols for you.
Nobody tells me nothing, but they'll translate those symbols for you.
And I know where to find them. -Show us. -Yeah.
SIMMONS: The closest one's in Washington.
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. Land of dreams in there.
All I ever wanted to be was an astronaut.
-SIMMONS: Hold those. -What is that?
What? I wear them when I'm in a funk.
So does Giambi, Jeter. It's a baseball thing. Okay.
Watches synchronized, sharp mind and empty bladder.
You get caught, demand an attorney and don't ever say my name.
Take one of these pills. Slip it under your tongue.
It's the high-concentrate polymer they put in Oreo cookies.
Tricks the polygraph every time.
Okay. Now, let's get this show on the road.
(BUZZING) Whoa. Whoa! No, listen, I can't do this.
I'm not some alien bounty hunter, guys. I'm not gonna do this. Guards have guns. I don't want to die.
I'm not gonna do this. Guards have guns. I don't want to die. Kid, kid, kid.
You compromise this mission, you are dead to me.
Now look into my eyes and tighten up that sphincter.
GUARD ON PA: The museum is now closing.
Yo, baba! Bad news, bro. Ran out of toilet paper.
You got any out here? Please tell me you do.
Sir. I suggest you get in there. The museum is closed.
Listen, man, I understand that, but as you can see, this is important.
All right? Thumper dumper. I got to go. All right.
GUARD: Sir, you are a grown, naked man around children.
Pull your pants up and exit the building.
LEO: I'm not going anywhere.
You got that paper, right, sir? GUARD: You should be embarrassed.
This is a family museum, sir.
What is going on here?
How many times can you get tased in the nuts before you can't have kids?
You are an amateur, man, a rank amateur.
We just downed five guards. Five guards.
-Get your stuff and get out of here. -Give me a second here.
I got to get the tracker, all right.
Be good. WHEELIE: I'm claustrophobic.
Look, look. Follow him. Follow him. He knows where he's going.
-He knows something. -What?
He knows something.
(DEVICE BEEPING RAPIDLY) -You got what I got? -Yeah.
SIMMONS: Blackbird.
There he is.
This guy's a legend, like the Chairman of the Board!
Yo, freshman, point the shard and watch the magic happen.
Shit. It's a Decepticon!
-Decepticon? -Decepticon?
Behind the MiG now!
JETFIRE: What sort of hideous mausoleum is this?
Answer me, pawns and knaves.
Show yourselves or suffer my infinite wrath.
You little spinal-cord-based organisms!
Bugger it.
Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire.
Prepare for remote systems override
I tell you, this guy did not age well.
I don't think he's gonna hurt us.
I command these doors to open.
Fire! I said, fire!
Bollocks.
Damn these worthless parts.
Wait a second.
Itchy, wretched rust in my arse.
The museum is going to be very angry. Very angry.
We gotta catch that plane.
Right. I'm on a mission.
HUMANS: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
-What do you want? -Look, we just want to talk.
I have no time to talk. I'm on a mission.
I'm a mercenary doom-bringer. What planet am I on?
-Earth. -Earth?
Terrible name for a planet. Might as well call it "Dirt."
Planet "Dirt."
Tell me, is that robot civil war still going on?
-Who's winning? -The Decepticons. (GROANS)
Well, I changed sides to the Autobots. What do you mean, changed sides?
JETFIRE: It's a choice. It's an intensely personal decision.
So much negativity. Who wants to live a life filled with hate?
You mean you don't have to work for those miserable, freaking Decepticons?
If Decepticons had their way, they'd destroy the whole universe.
I'm changing sides. I'm changing sides, too, warrior goddess.
-Who's your little Autobot? -You're cute.
Name's Wheelie. Yeah. Say my name, say my name.
What are you allowing to happen to your foot just now?
At least he's faithful, Sam.
Yeah, well, he's faithful and he's nude and he's perverted.
(MOANING) Can you just... Can you stop?
-Hey, what are you doing? -It's just something
to think about. I won't argue with... What were you saying?
I told you my name was Jetfire, so stop judging me.
Somebody shit the bed this morning. JETFIRE: I have issues of my own.
And it started with my mother.
My ancestors have been here for centuries.
My father, he was a wheel, the first wheel.
Do you know what he transformed into?
-No. -Nothing.
But he did so with honor, dignity, damn it.
Bollocks.
(MUTTERING) My boosters are fried.
I think we can help each other.
You know things I don't know. I know things you don't know, I do.
I don't think he knows anything. Honestly, I don't.
I could do this all day. It comes in waves, these vivid symbols.
They're symbols, but they're in my mind.
You see, all this is in my mind and Megatron wants what's in my mind.
Him and someone called the Fallen. The Fallen? I know him.
He left me here to rust. The original Decepticon.
He's terrible to work for. It's always apocalypse, chaos, crisis.
These transcriptions, they were part of my mission, the Fallen's search.
I remember now, for the Dagger's Tip, and the key.
Slow down. The Dagger's Tip? The key? What are you talking about?
No time to explain. Hold on, everybody. Stay still or you'll die.
Well, that wasn't so bad.
I just hope we're still on the right planet.
WHEELIE: Hey, that freaking hurt.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, what a beautiful face.
This would be a perfect moment, except you landed on my testicles.
Please, get off.
(GRUNTS) God, my balls.
MIKAELA: Sam!
Where are we? Simmons! Hey! Yeah!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What is this? It's Vegas.
-SAM: You guys okay? -MIKAELA: Yeah.
LEO: Hey, I think we're in Vegas.
That really, really hurt. You're just lucky that I didn't get hurt!
People could have gotten killed, okay? And if I would have gotten hurt,
-you would have heard... -Shut up.
I told you I was opening a space bridge.
It's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.
When did you... When did you tell us? You didn't tell us anything.
You didn't tell us anything. Why are we in Egypt?
Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling. You were duly informed.
Can you just stop for a second? Can you focus? Can you tell us why we're in Egypt
so we can all have a little bit of semblance of peace of mind?
JETFIRE: This planet was visited by our race once before,
by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago.
They were on an exploratory mission to harvest Energon,
the lifeblood of our race.
Without it, we'll all perish, oxidize and rust, like my wretched self.
Do you have any idea what it's like to slowly fall apart and die?
Let's not get episodic, okay, old-timer?
Beginning, middle, end. Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it.
Somewhere buried in this desert, our ancestors built a great machine.
It harvests Energon by destroying suns.
-Destroy suns? -You mean blow them up?
Yes. You see, in the beginning,
there were seven Primes, our original leaders.
And they set out into the universe, seeking distant suns to harvest.
The Primes set out with one rule, never destroy a planet with life,
until one of them tried to defy this rule.
And his name forevermore was the Fallen.
He despised the human race
and he wanted to kill you all by turning on that machine.
The only way to activate it is with a legendary key
called the Matrix of Leadership.
A great battle took place over possession of the Matrix.
The Fallen was stronger than his brothers,
so they had no choice but to steal and hide it from him.
In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave their lives to seal the Matrix away
in a tomb made of their very own bodies,
a tomb we cannot find.
Somewhere, buried in this desert, that deadly machine remains.
The Fallen knows where it is
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes, your world will be no more.
Okay, so how do we stop him?
Only a Prime can defeat the Fallen.
Optimus Prime?
So, you've met a Prime?
Why, you must have met a great descendant.
Is he alive, here on this planet?
He sacrificed himself to save me.
So, he's dead.
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop the Fallen.
So, the same energy that's gonna be used to reactivate the machine
could that energy somehow be used to reactivate Optimus
and bring him back to life?
It was never designed for that purpose,
but it's an energy like no other.
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix before the Decepticons get to me?
Follow your mind, your map, your symbols.
What you carved in the sand, it's your clue.
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip, Three Kings will reveal the doorway.
Find the doorway.
Go now! Go!
That was my mission. It's your mission now.
Go before the Decepticons find me and find you.
Okay, here's what my CIA contact says.
Ancient Sumerians used to call the Gulf of Aqaba the "Dagger's Tip."
-That's the Dagger's Tip. -It's part of the Red Sea.
It divides Egypt and Jordan like the tip of a blade.
29.5 degrees north, 35 east. Here it is.
First thing we've got to do is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.
How are you gonna get him halfway around the world?
I'm gonna make a call.
We got cops.
I can't go to prison, guys.
SIMMONS: Sam, we got to get off this road and lay low.
Man, stupid cops.
This is what's called blending in like a ninja.
Shut up or I'll blend my fist in your face.
They're gone.
Okay, we're running out of time. I gotta make the call to Lennox...
You're on the Worldwide Wanted List.
Try calling one base, they'll track you here in seconds.
CIA is all over this place!
You're gonna call.
Okay. That's a good idea. All right.
I mean, I just had my mind on other things,
like winding up in an Egyptian prison.
MAN ON PA: NEST departure, 2100 hours.
So, we're shipping him back to base. This is such a mistake.
SOLDIER: Major Lennox, phone call.
Lennox, I'm with the kid. The kid. You know, the one with the attitude, right?
know, the one with the attitude, right? We need the truck. The truck.
We need the truck. The truck. We got a possible resurrection going on over here.
You're not gonna believe where we are. Code Tut, as in King Tutankhamen.
Back of a $1 bill.
Coordinates for airdrop, 29.5 north, 34.88 east. Write it down. Write it.
Oh, my God. I got to go. Okay. Heat comes.
Wait, who are you?
Wait. It's me. Leo. Me. Leo. Leo. Leo.
Cops are coming right now. We need to go.
Move, move, move, move.
Coordinates, 29.5 north, 34.88 east.
Tip of the Red Sea. Gulf of Aqaba.
-Egypt? -Are you serious?
Sir.
Even if we could figure out a way to get big man over there,
how is this little kid supposed to bring him back to life?
Look, I don't know, but we got to trust him.
SAM: Okay, let's go over it again.
BOTH: When the dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
-the Three Kings...- Will reveal the doorway.
That's what he said. You know what it means?
-No, what does it mean? -SIMMONS: I have no idea.
LEO: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Checkpoint. Checkpoint.
I don't have my passport.
GUARD: Passport!
They got cameras at the top.
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
All right, chill. This is espionage now. I can handle it.
These are my people. I'm one-thirty-sixth Arab.
WHEELIE: Great, a fricking Munchkin.
Little people are mean. Tell him he's tall.
The Dagger's Tip? Right?
Egypt, Jordan. We want to go there.
Me and my family. This is my family. This is my son,
Me and my family. This is my family. This is my son, my other son, my daughter. We're tourists, from New York.
my other son, my daughter. We're tourists, from New York.
-New York? -Yes. Yes.
Fifty kilometers.
You look like the guy that runs my falafel stand. Thank you very much.
I- know. I know you from somewhere. -Go, Yankees!
Put it on the wire to the CIA.
SOUNDWAVE: Decepticons, boy's location detected.
(SHUSHING) SKIDS: Undercover, yo. You got to blend in with your surroundings.
You know, you got to be part of the landscape.
Awesome! I think aliens built that.
Yeah, yeah.
Come on. Move it! Move it!
Guard us. Low profile. Don't make a scene, okay?
WHEELIE: Yeah, some of us got work to do. Dumb Autobots.
SAM: Being my girlfriend is hazardous to your health.
Yeah, well, girls like dangerous boys.
-Do they? -Yeah.
You might as well just say it.
Ladies first.
Okay, so tonight you're going to be a gentleman.
You're really chivalrous.
Why are you mad at me?
You know what? Baby, I'm not... I'm not mad.
Do you realize that I just flew 3,000 miles to keep you from getting killed?
I know.
Who else could be your girlfriend, Sam?
Look at the things I go through with you.
And now we're underneath the moon and the stars
and the three most beautiful pyramids on the planet
and you still can't even tell me that you love me.
Pyramids.
-What? -Why do boys always change the subject?
Pyramids and stars.
-Sam? -Come with me really quick.
Simmons. Leo. Wake up.
Listen, astronomy class, page 47. Remember the class?
No. I was only in college for two days. Remember that?
-Here. Get up. Up, up. -What is he talking about?
Okay, you see those three stars?
You see how the last one touches the horizon?
That's Orion's belt, but it's also called the Three Kings.
And the reason for that is the three Egyptian kings
who built the pyramids of Giza built them to mirror those stars,
so it's like an arrow staring us straight in the face.
They all point due east, towards Jordan. The mountains of Petra.
PILOT ON PA: We've had an engine malfunction.
We're gonna have to divert to SOCCENT.
Flight master, let's lighten the load and prepare for bailout.
Bailout? Bailout? Bailout? Bailout?
All right, team, grab your chutes! Bailout like bailout?
You familiar with the standard MC-4?
Of course not. I've never jumped out of a perfectly good airplane before
-Wait, this really happening? -Yeah.
-Wait, this really happening? -Yeah. All right, here we go.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You're behind this, aren't you?
What are you talking about? You heard the pilot.
These guys don't mess around. This is just standard procedure.
I'm just following orders to the letter. Isn't that what you said?
(WHIMPERING) You just signed a death warrant on your career, Major.
What was that? What was that?
That's not good. Come on.
-Right this way. -I can't jump out of an airplane.
I have an ulcer. No, no.
Come on. It's okay. I really can't do this. What are you doing...
Come here! Come here.
Why aren't you wearing your chute? Because I have to secure the VIPs first.
Okay, I want you to listen very carefully
and memorize everything that I say.
Each chute has a GPS tracker so you can be found by Search and Rescue.
Right next to that's a fabric webbing called a bridle,
which holds the pin that keeps the main container closed.
Okay, are you listening?
-I can't hear what... -Stop that. All right. All right.
When the pilot chute inflates into the air,
When the pilot chute inflates into the air, it pulls the pin and opens the main.
Red's your backup, blue's your primary.
I want you to pull the blue. I need you to pull it really hard.
Not now, we're on the plane, you dumb-ass.
He say good-bye?
No, he didn't even say good-bye.
General, we're loaded and ready.
You give us the go, and we'll be ready to press in five minutes.
-Excellent. -Sir, you need to see this now.
-Have we checked these coordinates? -Egypt, sir.
-They're airdropping in. -You've got to be kidding me.
He knows something.
We need to be ready to back him up if this thing goes hot.
Copy that.
CIA just got a hit on the boy,
100 miles from the location on that little note there.
It's getting hotter.
It's gotta be around here somewhere.
SIMMONS: You see the size of this?
You see this? SKIDS: Spectacular.
Amazing. Look at that.
SAM: It's here somewhere, guys. Yeah, why?
'Cause we're trusting Grandpa Blackbird
who doesn't even know what planet he's on?
In his defense, this is the biggest doorway I've ever seen in my entire life.
Okay. Well, that's great. Let me do a quick search, all right?
Nope. Ever cross your mind, guys, that archeologists have been here before?
There's nothing here.
SIMMONS: Real life is heartbreak, despair, kid.
Sometimes you get to the end of the rainbow
and the leprechauns went and booby-trapped it!
LEO: I'm listening to you? You live with your mother!
It's not over. LEO: It is over. It's done.
Why are we still listening to you, little punk-ass?
I mean, what you ever done for us except ding my rim?
Killed Megatron. How about that?
Well, he didn't get the job done,
you know what I mean, 'cause he's back now...
Are you scared? Scared? Scared of your ugly face.
I'm ugly? Well, we're twins, you stupid genius.
Bring it, then. Get off me.
I'll change your face around. I'll get all up in that ass!
Bring it!
SAM: Guys! Whoa! Hey!
-You like the way that feels? -That didn't hurt.
You like that, don't you?
Come on, Bumblebee! Bumblebee, listen.
Now, that's rude.
SAM: Oh, my God. The symbols.
Bee! Shoot it.
SIMMONS: Check this out. SAM: Look at it.
SIMMONS: Wow! SAM: These are the bodies Jetfire was talking about.
SIMMONS: The tomb of the Primes.
Yo!
The Matrix.
SAM: No.
SIMMONS: Thousands of years, turned to dust.
This isn't how it's supposed to end.
Hear that?
US Air Force! C-17s!
SAM: What's a C-17? You can't bring him back, Sam.
There's nothing left.
Look! Look around you.
We didn't just go through everything we went through for no reason at all,
to just have it end like this.
There is a reason that we are here.
The voices and the symbols in my head led us here for a purpose.
Everyone's after me because of what I know,
and what I know is that this is going to work.
How do you know it's gonna work?
Because I believe it.
You best let me out of this plane.
Dropping the big boy. Sam!
You think you can bring him back to life with that pixie dust?
Absolutely. Let's go.
Go!
Let's move it. Remember, they're friendlies.
Cover Optimus!
Secure the village. Get those cases down here.
I need snipers and Stingers up high.
So, we just dropped off 10 tons of dead robot in the middle of nowhere.
I hope this little kid know what he's doing.
Yeah, me too.
Got a visual! Yellow team! Four clicks!
Pop flare!
That's them, right there. See the flare?
That's them, right there. See the flare? Right over there! See it?
Sam!
Oh, God. Please, God! Please.
Leo, stop freaking out. Stop freaking out. Shut this guy up, huh?
Please, just let me live, just let me live!
MIKAELA: Shut up and let him drive! Just stop screaming... All right, that's it! (SCREAMING)
I can't take that guy anymore.
SIMMONS: Hide in the dust. Use the dust.
We've got to split up. Bumblebee, you're the decoy.
You lead the Decepticons away, all right? -I'm gonna get Optimus. -I'll help draw their fire
-I'm gonna get Optimus. -I'll help draw their fire -with Huey and Dewey there. -You get to those soldiers.
-with Huey and Dewey there. -You get to those soldiers.
I hope that dust works, kid.
Thank you.
LEO: He's turning around. He's coming back. He's coming back.
It's up to me.
One man, alone, betrayed by the country he loves,
now its last hope in their final hour of need.
Prepare to be driven like never before, by the maestro.
Hey, hey. Don't go nowhere. Drive.
You'll never make it, kid. I'm coming with you.
Bravery will only get you so far. You tased me, okay? You owe me. I'm going.
You tased me, okay? You owe me. I'm going. Okay, okay. That was a test. You passed. All right?
That thing's got alien tattoos all over it. That ain't Air Force.
(ELECTRONIC WHIZZING) What the hell was that? -Anyone copy? -Anyone there? Who's up?
-Anyone copy? -Anyone there? Who's up?
-Copy? -SOLDIER: Radio's down. It's dead. Comms are down.
EMP burst.
I see how this day is going in this godforsaken desert.
Yes, sir? GALLOWAY: Major Lennox told me to pull the cord.
I know, sir. Well, what country am I in right now?
United States.
No, not the United States. I'm from the United States.
I'm in the middle of nowhere surrounded by donkeys.
Well, that was our good friend, Galloway. He's less than pleased.
How is it that we can't reach our men,
but he can reach me, from some random Egyptian desert?
Nothing.
Right, go burn an SOS. Let the eye in the sky know we need some help.
Yes, sir.
LENNOX: Pop some more flares so the kid can find us.
Look. There it is. We got a couple of miles.
Lennox's team has the latest in quantum crypto gear.
Can somebody tell me why we can't establish simple radio contact?
We're hailing them on every frequency and mode in the book, sir.
Our satellites in the area have gone blind. We're working it, sir.
Damn it. Something's not right. It doesn't add up.
Contact the Jordanians, see what air assets they've got in the area,
and get Egypt's General Salam.
Ask him to clear some USV overflights in Egyptian airspace.
We need an assist in confirming visuals now.
SOLDIER 1: Scramble Predators now.
SOLDIER 2: V-1, rotate.
SAM: We still have a mile that way.
Come on.
This way. This way.
One man, alone...
Stop saying that. ...betrayed by the country he loves!
Oh, my goodness. I'm in the car, okay? You're not alone.
SIMMONS: Just relax. You're with the maestro.
I don't think he's still following us.
That's what you think.
Uh-oh.
Master, sorry to be the bearer of bad news,
but the soldiers brought the body of Prime.
The boy must have the Matrix.
We cannot let him reach Optimus.
Decepticons, begin our assault!
SOLDIER: We've got incoming!
LENNOX: We got a whole lot of fight coming our way.
-How many? -About 13 of them.
This ain't good. This ain't good.
We're about to get our asses whupped.
SOLDIER: Bravo-Charlie, kneel.
All right, those Decepticons are searching for Sam.
Whatever he has, he thinks it'll bring Optimus back to life,
so our mission is to find him and get him to Optimus.
All right, we're gonna draw fire from the left flank. -I need a scout team. -IRONHIDE: I'm leading.
-I need a scout team. -IRONHIDE: I'm leading.
Go up through the middle with Arcee and Ironhide.
All right, when you see the precious cargo,
I want you to pop green smoke and come back through those pillars.
We'll have the ambush set. All right. Let's go. Move out!
You ever see that film Gunfight at the O.K. Corral?
With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas?
No, why?
Looks like we're right in the middle of it.
Is that good?
A lot of people died.
(WHIMPERING) Hide.
-Vamonos, amigos. -Oh, my God!
-Hit the deck! -Oh, my God!
(WHISPERING) Sam, Sam.
I don't think they saw us.
Get down. Get down. Get down.
Okay. Listen.
Once it's clear, we run for Optimus as fast as we can, okay?
What if it doesn't work?
It's gonna work.
What if it doesn't? It's gonna work. It'll work.
Up, up, up!
Get ready to jump.
SAM: We got a half-mile. I don't think the soldiers know we're here.
Fall back.
Ironhide, up the middle. Ironhide, move it.
Let's go! Go, go.
MEGATRON: Devastator!
We're trapped! There's nowhere to go. We're gonna die.
If we're going out, we're going out like men, understand?
Look at this mother...
Mean robots suck!
-Hang on! -Hang on, okay?
Simmons!
Don't let go! Hang in there, I got you! Just hang in.
I don't want to die!
Kung fu grip, boy. Kung fu grip!
You ain't getting me.
He dead. He got so ate.
Who's your daddy now, huh? He got all ate up.
The only safe place is right under it.
Run at it. Run for its feet! Move it!
Yeah.
You should've never eaten me. I'm gonna bust your face up.
Oh, my God!
Nobody mess with me. In your face.
Keep fighting, Mudflap.
Oh, my God!
Nobody messes with the twins.
-I got you... -My bad!
Aw, man! You shot me in the face
-Stay under it. -Yeah, stay under it.
Come on.
Judy!
-Sam! Sam! -What?
Sam! Sam!
JUDY: Sam!
-Sam! -Dad!
Wait, wait!
Please listen to me! I want you to run! Run!
Dad, just stop! They don't want you, they want me!
-RON: Oh, God! -Wait!
DEVASTATOR: Sam Witwicky.
Don't hurt them. This is what you want. You don't want them.
-Go! Go! -Please, stop!
-Stop. -JUDY: Listen to your father!
(WHISTLING) RON: Just get out of here!
Just don't hurt them. I know what you want.
RON: Just go! Just go!
And I know that you need me because I know about the Matrix.
-RON: Don't do it, Sam... -Please, Dad.
-RON: Don't do it, Sam... -Please, Dad. They're going to kill us all anyway. SAM: Here's what you want, right here.
Bumblebee!
Kill him, Bee. Kill him.
Stay tight, Ma. Come on. Get in here.
-Bee? -Yeah.
-Hey! -I don't know what's going on, but we've got to move!
what's going on, but we've got to move!
RON: There's got to be a way out of here!
Judy, get back, get back, get back.
Against the wall! Against the wall! Against the wall. Against the wall.
Bee! Bumblebee!
You get them somewhere safe, all right?
You've got to get in the car and get to safety.
No, this isn't up for discussion!
-You're my son! -You're my son! -I know.
-Dad... -We all go together!
-Listen... -We're all going together!
Dad, stop, okay? Get in the car. He's gonna get you to safety.
You know, you run. You don't stop,
you don't hide, you run. You hear what I'm saying, okay? I'll find you when you're safe.
-No. -You've got to let me go, Dad.
You have to let me go. You have to. Ron.
Ron. Ron, let him go.
You come back! Come on.
JUDY: Ron! Mikaela! Mikaela!
-Go with my parents. -I'm not gonna go without you.
SOLDIER: Move to cover!
We got Jordanians!
We got help!
Down!
You okay, soldier?
We're gonna help you, soldier. Let's get these wounded clear of the bird.
LEO: Stay still. Stay still. Don't move.
You all right, young man? You have a radio?
Hey, kid, it's been nice knowing you. Remember what I did for my country.
This is my moment.
You're crazy!
ETA to station, two minutes.
-Put it on the main screen. -Sir. Yes, sir.
Predator 01.
Shit, it's a trick.
Commence Operation Firestorm. Send everyone.
Get those Marines on the ground. Roll in strike packages...
Task Force Ripper, execute Lightning.
ARCEE: Spotted Sam! IRONHIDE: Sam!
Ironhide!
Follow us to the pillars. We'll take you to Optimus.
IRONHIDE: Get out, Sam! Get to the pillars.
Let's go.
Oh, God. This is it. The pyramid's built right over the machine.
If they turn that machine on, no more sun.
Not on my watch.
CAPTAIN: USS Stennis. Identify.
SIMMONS: Where the hell are you? Watching the Weather Channel?
SIMMONS: Where the hell are you? Watching the Weather Channel? SportsCenter? I Dream of Jeannie or something?
We got 300 satellites up there. Where the hell are all our men?
Identify yourself.
What is your name, sailor?
Wilder, Captain of the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier.
Okay, Captain Wilder.
This is Agent Seymour Simmons of Sector Seven.
There is the mother of all non-biologicals
getting ready to blow up our sun.
Do you want to have a throwdown about my lack of clearance
or do you want to help save a gazillion lives?
All right, Agent Simmons. I'm listening.
Five clicks west of the Gulf,
we got ourselves an alien remodeling a pyramid.
Our one hope is a prototype weapon called a rail gun,
shoots a steel projectile at Mach 7. That's classified.
Don't talk to me about classified, all right?
Now, if you've got a battleship in the Gulf, which I know you do,
you tell them to ready that weapon!
Contact destroyer USS KIDD.
GRAHAM: Alpha Team, flank left!
This way! Move it!
-Where do you need us, sir? -Protect those in line of fire.
Let's go! Go!
Give me your Comms. Come on. Epps!
Right now, we need air support, ASAP!
Have troops in contact 20 miles northwest. Radar contact.
Proceed to 88 Alpha Sierra...
B-1, snap 090.
You are approved to drop your 2,000-pound JDAMs.
-What you got? -I couldn't get to them, sir.
They're 600 meters away and heading right for the pillars.
All right. Precious cargo's coming!
SAM: Move!
Curse you!
IRONHIDE: Sam! Spotted Sam!
-Come on! -2-2 covering fire.
Two civilians, 12 o'clock!
Cover for us!
Hold the air strike! We're rescuing civilians!
Keep firing!
Come on! Mikaela!
Come on! Get in here!
Look who showed up.
You better have a good reason for us to be here.
-Where's Optimus? -He's right over there,
across the courtyard.
I got to get to him right now. Not with an air strike coming.
I have to get to him right now.
Whoa. Go. Back, back, back, back.
-Go. -DECEPTICON: Listen up...
Okay.
Incoming!
Stick the landing.
Behold the glory of Jetfire!
Now let me show you how we brought the pain in my day!
I'm too old for this crap.
Keep going, man, 15 rounds of fighting.
I am directly below the enemy's scrotum.
25.7 meters above sea level, 29.32 north.
Kill track, 5205...
Target acquired. Killing track. MAN ON PA: Two, one... Fire!
MAN ON PA: Two, one... Fire!
Yeah! Yeah!
PILOT: B-1's time on target, 30 seconds. 2,000-pound JDAMs inbound.
We're gonna make a break through the B's on my command, okay?
You guys stick with me, you understand? You stay on my ass.
PILOT: 1-1 tally orange smoke. I hope these F-16s got good aim.
I hope these F-16s got good aim. Yeah? Why is that? I told them to hit the orange smoke.
You mean that orange smoke?
It wasn't my best toss, okay?
PILOT: Viper, thunder.
Run!
Incoming!
Come on!
Sam!
Run!
Die!
Sam!
LENNOX: Hold your fire!
Sam!
Stay back! Mikaela, stay back!
Fucking do something!
Sam! Sam!
Sam! Sam! Sam! Sammy! Sam!
-Let me go! -LENNOX: Come, you gotta move. You got to move, come on.
MEDIC: We got no pulse.
Starting CPR.
I have to see my kid! I got a son... Sammy!
Sam!
MEDIC 1: Clear. MEDIC 2: Ready to shock.
Clear! MEDIC 2: Ready to shock. One, two, three.
(DEFIBRILLATOR BUZZES) Do it again!
No!
Okay, listen to my voice. I love you and I need you.
Please. Please, come back to me. Sam, please!
I love you.
SAM: Where am I? Where am I? Am I dead? Am I dead?
PRIME: We have been watching you a long, long time.
You have fought for Optimus, our last descendant,
with courage and with sacrifice, the virtues of a leader,
a leader worthy of our secret.
The Matrix of Leadership is not found, it is earned.
Return now to Optimus.
Merge the Matrix with his spark.
It is, and always has been, your destiny.
Sam!
I love you. I love you.
Boy, you returned for me.
A living Prime.
I don't believe it!
My Matrix!
Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!
JETFIRE: Get up, Prime!
Oh, no.
SAM: He's turning on the machine! You got to stop him! Get up!
Optimus!
MEGATRON: Fallen, my master.
My brothers could not stop me from this.
Yes, now I claim your sun.
Move! Enemy target, top of pyramid. Engage!
Engage! Engage!
In moments, we'll be at firing strength.
All my Decepticon life, I never did a thing worth doing until now.
Optimus, take my parts
and you will have a power you've never known.
Fulfill your destiny.
Jolt! Electrify!
Transplant those afterburners.
Let's roll.
SOLDIER: Fire mission on the pyramids.
This planet will be dark forever.
Die, like your brothers!
They were your brothers, too.
Starscream!
You picked the wrong planet.
Give me your face.
I rise.
You fall.
No, no.
Not to call you a coward, Master,
but sometimes cowards do survive.
This isn't over.
It took all this for you to tell me that you love me.
You said it first.
Thank you, Sam, for saving my life.
Welcome.
Thank you for believing in me.
OPTIMUS: Our races united by a history long forgotten
and a future we shall face together.
I am Optimus Prime,
and I send this message so that our pasts will always be remembered,
for in those memories, we live on.
So glad you could join us, Professor Einstein.
Why is the bank buying all this missile-guidance stuff from Calvini?
I don't get it.
The window will stay closed.
You need to relax.
I'm more comfortable tense.
You came to us, remember?
You wanted a way out and I'm offering you one.
I only met you 30 minutes ago...
...and now you expect me just to walk away from everything I know...
...put my life in your hands.
You want a little more time to think things through, I get it...
...but we're gonna need another meet...
...and I'm gonna need to see some paper.
Yes. Now get out of the car.
-Hey. -Ella?
-You done? -Yeah, I just met with him.
-And? -Oh, he's real.
He's real enough to blow this thing wide open.
He told me the bank's buying $200 million worth...
...of missile-guidance systems.
-What do they need those for? -I don't know.
You gonna see him a second time?
Yeah, yeah. Listen, we're gonna meet again. He's agreed to bring me paper.
Right, I'll call you later.
Thanks, Elle.
Hey.
Are you experiencing any blurred or double vision?
No.
Nothing.
Just follow the light, please.
It's been noted that you were experiencing ringing in your ears.
Yes.
Well, I would like to keep you here overnight for observation.
That won't be necessary.
Where's my colleague?
Thomas Schumer.
It was definitely a heart attack?
"Acute myocardial infarction." Yes.
Your penlight, can I use it?
What are you doing?
Can you help me turn him over?
-I'm afraid I can't allow you to-- -Just help me.
We need to contact the Berlin police and request an immediate autopsy.
Why?
Because I don't think this man died of natural causes.
Come on, Ella.
If Schumer met this insider in Berlin...
...odds are this guy's a foreign national. So it's federal.
But you're not listening to me. Let them meet again.
The guy's gonna bring paper and Tommy will close him.
You still have to coordinate with Justice if you want witness protection.
I just tried both their cells again. Straight to voice mail.
Shit.
I'm gonna try Tommy's wife at work. If I have to bring DOJ into this...
...they're gonna do what they've always done with this.
They're gonna stall us with red tape, informant's gonna bolt...
...and I'm telling you, he could be the bombshell...
...we've spent the last two years looking for.
Voice mail.
What's going on? Why aren't they calling us back?
What do you want me to do? I can't afford another turf war.
What do you want me to do? I can't afford another turf war. -It's Salinger. -Finally. Put him on speaker.
-It's Salinger. -Finally. Put him on speaker.
Jesus, Lou. What took you guys so long?
Hello? You there?
Yeah.
So, what's up?
Tommy's dead.
What?
He's dead, Ella.
I need you to get over here as soon as you can.
Unnaturally red blood, lambent membranes.
Two key indicators of hydrocyanic poisoning.
This lesion on the neck...
...is how the poison was introduced into the bloodstream, percutaneously.
The lesion tested negative for any poison.
There are any number of reasons for this discoloration of the blood...
...least likely of which is hydrocyanic--
I'm telling you, he was murdered.
Well, I'm assuming you suspect a combination...
...of prussic acid and DMSO...
...but then the reaction time would have been immediate.
Within one minute.
Which means the killer would have had to deliver the toxin...
...after Schumer exited the car.
So did you see anything unusual?
Anybody approaching Schumer?
No. I mean....
I don't know.
What is it that makes you so certain he was assassinated?
Agent Salinger and I have reason to believe this might be connected...
...to an ongoing investigation being conducted...
...by both my team at the Manhattan DA's office and Interpol.
-What investigation? -I run a group at Interpol...
...that focuses on financial operations associated with organized crime.
About two years ago, we began receiving correlated intelligence...
...regarding the illicit activities of a bank based out of Luxembourg...
...the International Bank of Business and Credit.
Under the direction of its chairman, Jonas Skarssen...
...we believe the IBBC has quietly become the bank of choice...
...for monies associated with organized crime, capital flight--
How is any of this related to Schumer and the New York DA's office?
The IBBC's Manhattan branch...
...is the epicenter of its U.S. money-laundering operation.
Schumer and I were working this case together.
Agent Salinger and his department have been assisting us.
Why weren't we informed of these details prior to this briefing?
What was Schumer doing here in Berlin?
I set him up on a blind date with an IBBC executive...
...who was aware of our investigation and looking to make a deal.
And the identity of this informant?
We don't know. He took precautions to keep his identity anonymous.
For the past 12 hours, I've been trying hard to find him.
I believe that if this man isn't already dead, he soon will be.
Why?
Because, just like Schumer...
...anyone that's in a position to move against this bank...
...has either ended up dead or disappeared.
Agent Salinger, given your history with this matter...
...I should think you would be more careful...
...before making such extreme accusations.
My history? What are you talking about?
We've reviewed your dossier.
Have you?
Well, that means you know just about shit.
I realize this is a trying time for you both, but until I'm provided...
...with something more compelling than unsubstantiated theories...
...pursuing the IBBC is simply not going to happen here in Germany.
Concorde Hotel, please.
What was that back there? What history was Diemer talking about?
-Don't worry. -Don't give me that shit.
-What do they know that I don't? -They don't know anything.
Enough to get a rise out of you.
I'm not getting into it. You're so curious, read my file.
I should never have let Tommy walk into this.
You didn't. I approved the meet.
I was across the fucking street, Ella.
I was right there.
I saw him go down.
I didn't see a thing.
We won't let them bury this, Lou.
This canvas appeals to you?
I like the look of agony.
Why?
Because I know it's true.
What am I doing here?
Umberto Calvini is disengaging from the deal.
Your principle would like to bring you in to troubleshoot the situation.
If Calvini refuses to move forward, my involvement won't make a difference.
Your involvement would allow them to appeal to Calvini's two sons...
...who are much more open-minded.
You'll find all the details in the file.
I'll contact you once negotiations are underway.
Rene?
What are you doing here so early?
Salinger.
I found the insider.
What?
I found the guy that Schumer met with in Berlin.
André Clément?
The IBBC's senior vice president of acquisitions.
He was killed in a road accident just outside Luxembourg...
...approximately nine hours after Schumer's death.
And this is the gendarmerie's preliminary accident report.
He arrived in Berlin at 8 a.m...
...on Luxair, Flight 9871 from Luxembourg.
What doesn't track is in his statement, the IBBC chairman, Jonas Skarssen...
...claims that Clément had been with him in Luxembourg since 10 a.m...
...which is obviously impossible if Clément arrived in Berlin at 8 a.m.
Did the gendarmerie say anything about this inconsistency?
Nothing.
-I haven't told them. -What?
I wanna go to Luxembourg and question Skarssen myself.
-No. Absolutely no. -Viktor, listen to me.
I go to Luxembourg, Skarssen confirms that statement...
...I catch him in that lie, I can build--
For chrissake, Lou, you're not at the Yard anymore.
Interpol is not in the law-enforcement business.
We deal in intelligence and facilitation.
Focus on that, work that and pass your take onto the appropriate authorities.
And then what?
You know we've been circulating our take since the very beginning.
No one ever does anything, no one ever can.
Whatever case we have gets lost in the complexities of international law.
Schumer, Clément...
...this entire fucking wall.
There's nothing that complex about cold-blooded murder.
Hi. I've got an appointment with Mr. Skarssen.
-Your name, please? -Mr. Salinger? Please follow me.
Mr. Skarssen.
Mr. Skarssen.
Agent Salinger? Please follow me.
Mr. White.
Agent Salinger. I apologize for the wait.
I'm Martin White, the IBBC's legal counsel.
This is Commissioner Villon of the gendarmerie.
I thought it useful for him to join us, considering the nature of your query.
Please, have a seat.
I think there's some misunderstanding.
I'm here to speak with Mr. Skarssen.
Yes, but as Mr. Skarssen's attorney, I insisted that I speak with you first.
Mr. White, I had a confirmed meeting with Mr. Skarssen at 11:00.
If I was gonna meet with you first, why didn't anybody tell me?
I understand, and I'm sorry for the confusion...
...but I'm sure I can help answer your questions.
Now, please, have a seat.
As I'm sure you're aware...
...I have some questions regarding André Clément.
Yes.
It's my understanding that Mr. Clément was working...
...at Mr. Skarssen's residence the night he was killed.
The night of the accident, yes.
What time did he arrive at Skarssen's home that day?
If I recall correctly, around 6 p.m.
-You were there? -Yes.
And you're certain about this time?
Quite.
I'm confused.
What you're telling me conflicts with Skarssen's statement...
...in the gendarmerie's accident report...
...which was that Clément had been working with him since 10 a.m.
I was present when Mr. Skarssen gave his statement.
-That is not what he said. -It is according to this report.
May I?
There is an error in the preliminary draft.
The time is wrong.
The finalized report here says Clément arrived at 6 p.m.
Clerical errors like this can happen from time to time.
This is why the gendarmerie discourages the release...
...of any preliminary documentation pertaining to open cases.
So is there anything else we can do for you, Agent Salinger?
-Yeah. -It's me.
I just got the results from the tox analysis I ran on Schumer.
-And? -It's inconclusive.
Inconclusive? What the hell is that supposed to mean?
They found trace elements of cyanide in his blood...
...but the levels are not nearly high enough...
...to meet their criteria for poisoning.
Are you there?
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Madame Clément?
It's Eleanor Whitman from the New York District Attorney's office.
I already left a couple messages just--
Mrs. Clément, I'm sorry to keep calling you.
I can only imagine what a difficult time this must be for you.
But I'm not convinced your husband's death was an accident.
Look, here's my cell number.
001-917-135-6565.
You can call any time--
Stop calling me. I have nothing to say to you. Just leave me alone.
Please. I just need to ask you a few questions.
I have two children. They've already lost their father.
-I understand. -No, you don't.
Are you aware your husband met with our investigators...
...the day he was killed?
You ever planning to come to bed?
-I heard your voice. -I'm sorry.
-When'd he come in here? -An hour ago.
T. rex was in the closet again.
Let me take him back.
Come on, buddy.
Lou?
They knew about the discrepancy in the report.
They had Skarssen's statement changed.
How did they know, Viktor?
-Come inside. -No.
Are you insane? It's freezing out.
Come outside.
Stop it!
Lou, wait.
Lou.
Have you lost your mind?
I think we take the dog for a walk.
Get some fresh air.
Who did this?
Who do you think?
From my apartment.
Whitman's got them too.
We need to inform the secretary general immediately.
You gotta be kidding.
We start setting off alarms, the opportunity will be lost.
Opportunity?
The last thing Schumer told Ella...
...was that Clément was giving him information on an IBBC arms deal.
Umberto Calvini. Chairman of Calvini Defense, one of the largest defense contractors.
Chairman of Calvini Defense, one of the largest defense contractors.
And probably Italy's next prime minister.
This guy standing next to him, that's our insider.
André Clément.
And?
Whitman found out that Clément was negotiating for the IBBC...
...to purchase a large number of missile-guidance...
...and control systems from Calvini Defense.
But at the very last minute, the deal collapsed.
What happened?
We don't know. Whitman's meeting me in Milan tomorrow.
We're gonna talk to Calvini and find out.
-Hey. -Hey.
Eleanor Whitman, this is Inspector Alberto Cerutti.
-Charmed. -Nice to meet you.
Please, there's not much time.
Calvini leaves for Turin immediately after this engagement.
I didn't realize we were meeting at a political rally.
Best we could do on such short notice.
Thirtieth floor. I'll be waiting outside.
You need to press the button.
You look awful.
Thanks.
When was the last time you got any sleep?
Don't know.
When was the last time you had a healthy meal?
Can't remember.
-How about the last time you got laid? -Why, are you offering?
You need to take better care of yourself, Lou.
I can't have you crash and burn like you did two years ago.
Please follow me.
This meeting is strictly off the record.
Mr. Calvini cannot be entangled in your investigation...
...nor can his participation in this discussion find its way to the press.
We understand.
Wait here for a moment.
So you read my file.
I made a few calls to London.
You should've told me everything...
...with your IBBC case at the Yard. You should've told me it's why you left.
What did they tell you?
That you screwed up because the witness you brought in was a joke.
And when you were forced to drop him, the case fell apart.
You flipped out, attacked the assistant commissioner and broke his nose.
My case did not fall apart, it was shut down, and my witness was rock-solid.
He gave us everything we needed against the bank...
...and then suddenly, out of nowhere, my AC forced me to cut him loose.
Three days later, they all died in a car crash.
-"They"? -He had a wife and two kids.
Mr. Calvini, we'd like to know why the IBBC, a bank...
...would be purchasing millions of dollars' worth of missile-guidance...
...and control systems from your company.
The IBBC has purchased billions of dollars' worth...
...of Silkworm missiles from the People's Republic of China...
...which they have presold to clients in the Middle East...
...contingent upon the missiles...
...being equipped with VOLCON guidance systems.
My company's one of only two in the world which produce the VOLCON.
-Who's the other? -Sunay. Ahmet Sunay.
Of Turkish Aerotech?
But why is the bank committing so much capital and resources...
...to the sale of these missiles?
It's a test.
Small arms are the only weapons used... ...in 99 percent of the world's conflicts...
...in 99 percent of the world's conflicts...
...and no one has the capacity to manufacture them...
...faster and cheaper than China.
What Skarssen is attempting to do...
...is to make the IBBC the exclusive broker...
...of Chinese small arms to the Third World.
And the missile deal is the gateway transaction.
Yeah, but billions of dollars invested simply to be a broker?
There can't be much profit for them.
No. This is not about making profit from weapon sales.
It's about control.
Control the flow of weapons, control the conflict.
No.
No, no. The IBBC is a bank.
Their objective isn't to control the conflict...
...it's to control the debt that the conflict produces.
You see, the real value of a conflict...
...the true value...
...is in the debt that it creates.
You control the debt...
...you control everything.
You find this upsetting, yes?
But this is the very essence of the banking industry...
...to make us all, whether we be nations or individuals...
...slaves to debt.
You sound like you're not very fond of the IBBC.
What happened?
I was fond of André Clément.
I trusted him...
...and he was a good friend.
Then help us make sure he didn't die in vain.
Find me after the speech.
We can talk in the car on my way to the airport.
Umberto Calvini.
Definitely connected to any--
Oh, my God. Are you all right?
I think so.
Take that left. Maybe you can cut him off.
Go.
Go!
Turn off the engine... ...and stick your hands out of the window!
Turn off the engine... ...and stick your hands out of the window! Now!
Our relationship with the Swiss has become impossible over the past year.
They are discounting our dollar deposits...
...by 160 basis points below par.
They have doubled the cost of moving our money.
Well, general, what do you expect?
You've been in the jungle long enough...
...to know that when the lion kills, it's the jackal that profits.
Yes.
The IBBC is specifically structured...
...to handle the particular needs of your type of organization.
We can give you better rates and terms than other competitors...
...but we can offer you much more:
Weapons...
...intelligence, logistical support...
...everything that the Revolutionary Freedom Front...
...would need to revive itself.
But in exchange for what?
You must understand, the RFF has no money.
Money is not this institution's primary medium of exchange.
What are you proposing exactly?
We believe that, with the right kind of direction and support...
...the RFF could become a very influential force in your country.
Perhaps potent enough...
...to stage a successful coup in the coming months.
And if this were possible...
...what does your bank hope to gain from it?
The gratitude and consideration of a very influential friend.
Excuse me.
Mr. White and Mr. Ehames asked me to interrupt.
Would you excuse me, general? I'll be right back.
What is it?
Approximately 30 minutes ago, Umberto Calvini was assassinated...
...while giving a speech at a political rally in Milan.
We've been discussing it.
I think we should wait until the authorities resolve the matter...
...and then approach the sons to revive negotiations.
How long will this take?
I've been assured the investigation will move swiftly...
...but unexpected fallout of an event like this can always complicate things.
We only have 60 days left to deliver the worms.
There's no time for complications.
That's a risk you take with such an ambitious agenda.
I don't foresee any problems. Had it not been for their father...
...Mario and Enzo Calvini would have made our deal long ago.
Now there's no reason for them not to move forward.
An important man and devoted father has just been killed.
I suggest that we send a letter to Calvini's family...
...extending our heartfelt prayers and condolences for their terrible loss.
I don't know, but I'm okay.
The doctors checked me out thoroughly.
Kiss Jake for me, will you?
So the shooter was identified as a member of the Red Brigade.
What about the guy in the car?
Car was stolen. They were unable to lift prints, fibers or residue...
...or locate any witnesses who saw him exiting the vehicle.
-So? -So the carabinieri are announcing...
...that the Red Brigade was responsible...
...for the assassination at the press conference tonight.
We're not convinced the Red Brigade's behind this.
Someone could simply be making it appear as though they are.
This isn't my case...
...and the man in charge of the investigation is very powerful...
...and a real bastard.
All we wanna do is just look around a little.
-Antonio. -Alberto.
Just a moment.
They done the trajectory analysis yet?
Cerutti said no.
If there was a second shooter, he could've positioned himself here.
The stopwatch they found in the room...
...it was set on a one-minute countdown, yes?
Right. Calvini was killed a little over one minute into his speech.
What if this was all synchronized?
Okay...
...let's say I'm the second shooter.
The guy below doesn't know I'm here...
...but I'm positioned right above his room.
I'm armed with a Sauer 200 rifle, just like he is.
I have a stopwatch set on a one-minute countdown...
...which I start when Calvini begins his speech.
The sniper below has been instructed to do the same...
...because that's when he's gonna fire his first bullet.
If he misses, I'm ready to follow through with one of my own.
The sniper fires, misses.
Seconds later...
...I take Calvini out with a headshot.
It's a good theory, but there's one problem.
Why?
Two shots were fired from the window...
...two slugs were recovered...
...and two casings were found next to the gun...
...ballistics confirming that the casings came from the gun in the hotel room.
So if the kill shot came from a second shooter here on the roof...
...that'd be a total of three bullets fired.
How do you explain the absence of the third bullet?
I can't.
I think I've seen this print before.
Where?
Hanging on the wall of my office.
So this was lifted from the scene of the Stefan Heuss hit in Brussels last year.
A former IMF executive director.
Has he ever seen a tread pattern like this before?
He believes it came from a custom shoe made for a leg brace.
The braces are typically made out of steel... ...or alloy, but the condition of the leg...
...or alloy, but the condition of the leg... ...would determine the specific type of device used.
He says that the prints are a probable match.
Please get these over to Alan Kovacs at FBI Impressions right away...
...and make sure he has my contact numbers.
Thanks.
Ella, if the FBI confirms that these prints are a match...
...it means the bank's used the same assassin twice.
Which means if we can get him, we can get the bank.
What was that?
That was Capitano Barillo, the man in charge of the Calvini investigation.
-What did he want? -My ass on a platter...
...and both of you on the next flight out of Milan.
Didn't you tell him what we just found?
I tried.
Fuck him. He can't force us to leave.
He has already spoken to your superiors.
You have both been ordered home.
Arnie, you can't just sit there...
...and lecture me about protocol and procedure.
You know what's happening here.
Well, who gives a shit about jurisdictional provenance?
We just had a major breakthrough.
That's great, Arnie. You're a real stand-up guy.
This is total bullshit.
I wish I could have been more helpful.
Oh, no, you've been great, Alberto.
I'm gonna do everything I can to take the heat off you.
Thanks.
Thanks for everything. Sorry for all the trouble we caused.
What?
His leg brace would be made of metal, right?
-So? -So if he left through an airport...
...security would have made him show it to them.
That's definitely him.
-He doesn't look like much. -I think that's the idea.
Seems to know where the cameras are.
Look how he always angles his face just out of our line of sight.
Even if you do find him...
...that's not enough evidence to convict the man without a confession.
If we find him, prosecution will be irrelevant. He'll be a marked man.
He can either die for the bank or flip for us.
I got him. He is traveling under the name Sherwood, Timothy M.
He boarded Flight Alitalia 422, departing Milan at 6 p.m. yesterday...
...and arriving in New York at JFK at 10 p.m.
What time's the next flight to New York?
Detectives Hubbard, Ward, Ornelas, this is Agent Lou Salinger.
-Finally. -How you doing?
-Let me take that. -Thanks. So, what do we have?
Well, we got lucky.
Some clip shots of him moving through customs.
That's a good one.
The Sherwood ID he used? It's clean. All of it attached to a dead address.
Where'd he go after he cleared customs?
Don't know. CCTV footage lost him at the curb.
We canvassed all the limousine and taxicab companies in the city.
Airport parking, rental agencies. Didn't come up with shit.
There's a chance he might live in the city.
Why is that?
Kovacs from FBI Impressions called.
"The footprint was left by a shoe used for knee-ankle-foot orthosis.
The tread pattern is exclusive to shoes produced...
...at the Isaacson Orthopedic Institute here in the city."
The shoe could have only come from there.
Do you have a contact person to run down?
We got Dr. Isaacson.
All right. You guys go check it out. I'm expected at the office.
Hubb?
Get ready for the smackdown. He's gonna come at you hard.
-Who is it? -N.Y.P.D.
-Dr. Isaacson? -Yeah.
Detective Ornelas, N.Y.P.D. This is my partner, Detective Ward.
-We'd like to ask a couple questions. -Why?
What do you want? Why are you here?
Calm down. We just wanna ask you a few questions about a patient.
Patient? What patient? Come on, you know what time it is?
Listen, I'm sorry. I must go. I really didn't do anything.
-I'm sorry. Good night. -Doctor, if we could--
Douche bag's pinned out of his mind. He thinks we're here to bust him.
Dr. Isaacson, please.
We have reason to believe your life is in danger, grave danger.
We think one of your patients is trying to kill you.
Kill me?
I'm Agent Salinger with Interpol. We're assisting in this manhunt.
Why would a patient wanna kill me? I'm an orthopedist.
This man's a psychotic. He's already butchered seven doctors in Europe.
We got some serious evidence to suggest you may be next.
Have you ever seen this man?
No, no. I don't think so.
Does the name Timothy Sherwood mean anything to you, doctor?
No. How do you know he's a patient of mine?
We have his footprint.
Yeah, the shoe was manufactured by AGM Biomechanics...
...exclusively for the Isaacson Institute, model K-A-F-O 1-2-1.
K-A-F-O 1-2-1?
We started prescribing that three years ago.
We've used it on hundreds of our patients.
Well, then we're gonna need to review all of your files.
Right now?
Doctor, we need to find this man before he finds you.
-What are you trying to do here, Ella? -I'm doing my job.
You have any idea of the shitstorm you've gotten me into?
-We're just trying to get to the truth. -I get it.
You need to remember there's what people wanna hear, wanna believe...
...there's everything else, then there's the truth.
And since when is that okay? I can't believe you're saying this to me.
The truth means responsibility, Arnie.
Exactly, which is why everyone dreads it.
Look....
The IBBC is using one assassin for all their hits...
...and we've tracked him here to New York.
This guy can bury them.
They want me to put a gun to your head.
You don't find this guy, and I mean quick...
...they're gonna make me pull the trigger.
Gentlemen.
Sorry to disturb you at home. I'm afraid this couldn't wait.
Yes?
Salinger was in Milan.
Whitman too.
They have the scent.
It's only a matter of time before they find our consultant.
Any recommendations?
I strongly advise against doing anything...
...that would heighten your exposure right now.
Wilhelm, we've leveraged ourselves over the edge.
If we don't meet the delivery date, buyers will cancel orders...
...our plans will implode...
...and this bank will be left a bill it cannot pay.
Heightening exposure is the least of our problems.
I agree. We're about to engage Calvini's sons.
We can't allow anyone to put our agenda at risk.
We must sever all ties with the consultant.
Consider the mark, gentlemen.
Doing this could be a very messy affair.
Well, then make it one.
I don't know why you pay me to advise on these matters.
It is clear that you don't want my counsel, only my corroboration.
Really, Wilhelm. We've had just about all we can take of you.
Yes. I've had about all I can take of myself.
How would you like us to proceed?
-Fucking disgusting, you know that? -What are you, my mother?
No, but I could be your old man for all you know, asshole.
Hey, doc.
Gabriel Hansen?
I don't know. My associate handled this.
Well, the address is a post-office box...
...and he paid cash for all of his medical bills.
There are no diagnostic photos. Why?
-I don't know. -Is there a number?
Yeah, 212-157-6421.
It's a dead line.
I'll put a call in to Hubby, have her run it down.
See if we can't get a crack warrant for the P.O. Box in Jersey.
What do all these GT's next to the appointment entries mean?
We have a kickback account with Go Taxi...
...and they indicate when we use their service for a patient.
Hey. Hubb says you caught a lead.
Yeah, we've got an address. We're en route.
-What is it? -Well, it could be him.
-Really? -Yeah.
Well, they gotta bring him in now. This is our last shot.
What do you mean, "our last shot"?
Arnie and I had it out last night, and our clock's run out.
If we don't get this guy right now, it's over.
Well, it better be him, then.
I'm here. Yeah.
I know that.
This is definitely the right address?
Checked the log myself. This is where they dropped him off every time.
Well, he could be anywhere.
-What do you think he was doing? -Beats the shit out of me.
It's a big, empty lot.
Well, I'm starving. I'm gonna get something. You want anything?
Yeah, a coffee, black.
I'm going back down to headquarters after this.
Okay, all right.
Right, bye.
How long do you think this has been like this?
I don't know, but we need to find out.
The doctor's records say the last time...
...somebody got dropped off here was five weeks ago.
I mean, there's not even a temporary office or anything.
-How you doing? -How you doing?
Son of a bitch.
What's the matter?
I just made our perp. Eleven o'clock, blue overcoat.
-You sure that's him? -A hundred percent.
-Where did he come from? -Shit if I know.
I'm at the counter and I see him rolling past the window.
-Wanna go for the collar? -No.
We tail him, find out where he sleeps, then take him down.
A, B, C. Keep the box tight.
-Five-oh-two-six. Designator? -Samuel Koppler.
Message:
Your uncle wishes to see you immediately.
Response?
The Guggenheim, fifth floor of the rotunda, 40 minutes.
-Hi, how you doing? -Hello.
N.Y.P.D. I need to speak to your security chief.
Okay, one moment.
Rick?
How you doing? Detective Ornelas. I need to be able to clear security.
-Okay. -Thanks.
We're clear.
Directly behind me.
There you go. Thank you.
Who's the old scag sitting next to him?
I don't know, but I saw him at the bank's headquarters in Luxembourg.
You don't look well today.
We all begin better than we end.
What would you prefer your ending to be like?
Oh, more purposeful, and certainly more climactic.
A finale.
A finale.
Circumstances can always be arranged.
As much as the thought appeals to me...
...I'm afraid your consideration is needed elsewhere.
-What is this? -Salinger.
The method and manner is entirely up to you.
Your principle would simply like him to vanish without a trace.
-Any other provisions? -Yes.
No mistakes.
I'll follow.
-Where's Iggy going? -Following a new lead.
Shit.
We gotta go.
N.Y.P.D. Lock your hands behind your head.
Do it now.
They'll never let you bring me in.
Do it, or I'll take you down.
-Cuffs. -On the belt.
There's a guy right up there.
-Where'd he--? -Up there! Up there!
Get down!
-God! Oh, my God! -It's okay.
Down there.
Shit.
Drop the gun.
-If I drop the gun, we'll both die. -I said, drop the gun!
They're here for me but they'll kill you too. Now help me get this off.
I can't breathe.
Stairs.
-Fuck. -You okay?
The ramp is the only way out.
Hey.
Don't you fucking dare.
I'm calling from the dark side.
-Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. -I'm calling from the--
Get back.
I told you.
What? You told me what?
They'd never let you bring me in.
Fuck, fuck.
Move away from the building.
Can everybody please move away from the building?
They know you're coming. We gotta hurry.
-Where'd they find him? -Sitting on a bench near the reservoir.
-Has he said anything yet? -Nothing. He's pretty shaken up.
-Who else knows he's here? -Everyone. Nothing I could do.
Heavies from the Bureau and Justice are on their way.
--with an unidentified third man.
-How long do I have? -Five, 10 minutes, max.
--wanted for questioning in an ongoing investigation.
Now, a Guggenheim employee tells me that while they were in the museum--
This isn't over.
Are you sure about this?
Just read it.
-They recognize you? -Don't think so.
Back it up!
-...screens came crashing down. -How you doing?
-There was glass everywhere. -As compared to what?
And just on the ground.
When you heard all of this commotion, did you think--?
Anything you need, Ellie, just let me know.
-Thanks. -I just heard gunshots.
And people were hit and screaming...
...and people just started running out the door...
...and I didn't know what was going on.
You okay?
Yeah.
You flip this guy.
You make sure my partner wasn't killed for nothing.
I know that-- I think random people were going down and--
I mean, there was police running up as other people were going down.
You ready for this?
Good evening, Colonel Wexler.
I'm Agent Louis Salinger.
I know who you are.
Of course you do.
I was at the Guggenheim this afternoon.
The assassin you met with...
...I know you were his handler.
I know you arranged for him to be killed at the behest of the bank...
...because I was obviously getting too close.
But if a hit team at the Guggenheim is what happens...
...because I was getting too close to him...
...what do you think the bank'll do when it realizes how close I am to you?
Death comes for us all, Agent Salinger.
But based on everything I've read about you...
...you seem like the kind of man...
...who aspired to die for something more than this.
Well, this is the difference between truth and fiction.
Fiction has to make sense.
I'm confused, colonel.
Why would a tried and true communist...
...a hardliner that spent 30 years in the Stasi...
...fighting against the evils of capitalism....
Why would this man waste his final days working for an institution...
...that was the very embodiment of everything he once despised?
You dedicated your life to the communist ideal.
You sacrificed everything for the good of the party.
For what?
You lost your wife to betrayal...
...your daughter to suicide...
...and when the Wall fell, your whole life fell apart with it.
You know nothing about me.
I was lost long before the Wall fell.
I was once destined to become a man much like yourself.
True-hearted...
...determined...
...full of purpose.
But...
...character is easier kept than recovered.
We cannot control the things life does to us.
They are done before you know it, and once they are done...
...they make you do other things...
...until at last, everything comes between you...
...and the man you wanted to be.
No.
We all have choices in life. You made yours.
Sometimes a man can meet his destiny...
...on the road he took to avoid it.
Skarssen and that bank need to answer for what they've done.
They have to be brought to justice.
You can help me do that.
Justice...
...is not possible.
Why not?
Because, Agent Salinger...
...your idea of justice is an illusion.
Understand the very system that you serve and protect...
...will never allow anything to happen to Skarssen or the bank.
On the contrary.
The system guarantees the IBBC's safety...
...because everyone is involved.
What do you mean, "everyone"?
Hezbollah.
CIA.
The Colombian drug cartels.
Russian organized crime.
Governments of Iran, Germany, China, your government.
Every multinational corporation, every one.
They all need banks like the IBBC...
...so that they can operate within the black and gray latitudes.
And this is why your investigative efforts... ...have either been ignored or undermined...
...have either been ignored or undermined...
...and why you and I will be quietly disposed of...
...before any case against the bank ever reaches a court of law.
So, what are we all supposed to do?
We just supposed to give up...
...and accept that this is the way of the world?
I'm not gonna do that.
I still believe-- I know...
...that there has to be a way to bring down this bank...
...and you are gonna help me.
You understand...
...if you really want to stop the IBBC...
...you won't be able to do it within the boundaries of your system of justice.
You will have to go outside.
Once you do...
...there will always be collateral damage.
Yes.
Should you sacrifice your own ideals for the greater good?
That's a difficult choice, one I understand all too well...
...but as you so eloquently put it...
...sometimes a man can meet his destiny...
...on the road he took to avoid it.
What?
What are you doing?
I think it's time for you to leave.
-Leave? What are you talking about? -You know what I'm talking about.
No way, Lou.
No fucking way. You've already got him turned.
Now go back in there and get him to come in on his own.
We can use everything. We'll blow this whole thing wide open.
-I don't think so. -Why not?
I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
-I can protect him, Lou. -No, you can't. They'll get to him.
If they can't, they'll get to you.
If they can't get to you, they'll get to your family.
I can't just walk away from this.
You're walking away so I don't have to.
How can you trust him?
That relic in there is looking for redemption.
I'm the only one who can give it to him.
Then who gives it to you when this is all over?
You need to cut me loose.
Tell them I escaped from custody, whatever you have to.
Just use my history. They'll believe you.
-I don't know. -Ella, listen to me.
Sometimes the hardest thing...
...is to know which bridge to cross and which to burn.
I'm the one you burn.
We've been waiting here for an hour.
I'm sorry, Martin, but none of us have been able to reach them.
Unfortunately, Mario and Enzo Calvini are not known for their punctuality.
They do realize this is the closing?
Mr. White...
...I've been instructed to escort you and your associates from the building.
Please gather your materials and come with me.
-Instructed by whom? -Please, if you could just comply.
Our father never trusted these people.
Thank you for telling us the truth.
Had you not come forward...
...we would have made a terrible mistake today.
I'm just glad I could be of service.
I don't know, Jonas. I was told nothing. I was simply thrown out.
They know.
Look, I can't discuss this right now. I'll call you when I'm in the air.
Welcome to World News. I'm Tristana Moore.
We're live today in the Democratic Republic of Niberia.
As we go on air, we're getting reports that thousands of troops...
...loyal to General Charles Motomba's Revolutionary Freedom Front...
...are moving towards the capital of Dénué.
According to eyewitnesses, several explosions have been heard...
...and there've been heavy outbreaks of gunfire in many parts of the city.
The people of Niberia have suffered greatly.
It is time to begin a new chapter in our country's history.
We will not stop until national liberation...
...and the restoration of nationhood--
News about Martin?
He didn't show up at his hotel or at the airport.
The Italian police have been unable to locate his car or driver.
I think Enzo and Mario Calvini are sending us a message.
How could they possibly have found out?
This is precisely what we pay you to know.
We're out of time and options.
-We must make the deal with Sunay. -How can we trust this man?
The Israeli government is his biggest customer.
Why would he agree...
...to help us provide missiles to the Iranians and the Syrians...
...that have a first-strike capability against the Israelis?
I know Sunay. I believe he has every intention...
...of selling you the guidance systems...
...because he's already provided the Israelis...
...with the countermeasures to defeat them.
Would the Turk really play such a dangerous game?
We are.
The only way we can make this work...
...is to guarantee... ...that Sunay keeps this information in complete confidence.
If our buyers find out the missiles are worthless, they'll pull all their orders...
...and this bank will be left insolvent.
Have him here by tomorrow afternoon.
Tomorrow he's going to a funeral service for his cousin.
He'll be unavailable till Monday.
Unless of course, you'd be willing to attend.
Make the call.
Get me Ahmet Sunay.
It's tomorrow.
It's right there. Do you want to be escorted?
We'll be fine, thank you.
The Sunay funeral, please.
It will be over soon. You may wait here.
-Is there a bathroom I could use? -Just over there.
-I won't be a moment. -Right.
-The signal? -Good.
The Sunay funeral, please.
-Where'd you put the spike? -Inside the lapel of his jacket.
The lawyer?
White?
He's gone.
I told you, there will always be collateral damage...
...when you take matters into your own hands.
Your plan is working.
It has left Skarssen with only one option.
Record the conversation and you'll gain your end.
Sure they'll talk about Sunay's deal with Israel and the countermeasures?
It is the key issue.
Once you let the Iranians and Syrians...
...hear that the missiles are completely useless against the Israelis...
...they will cancel their orders and the IBBC will collapse.
-Wilhelm. -Ahmet.
It's been a long time.
Yes.
My sympathies for the loss of your cousin.
Thank you.
Jonas Skarssen, Ahmet Sunay.
If you'd simply come to me in the beginning, it would have been better.
Midday prayers will begin soon.
Should take a short time to settle on the broad strokes.
The rest can be sorted out at your leisure.
We have 10 minutes.
Wilhelm, would you mind if I spoke to Mr. Sunay alone?
I believe I understand the particulars of your situation.
Perhaps we should discuss this in a more private place.
Yes, of course.
Allow me to show you something very special.
Something that very few outsiders know exists.
It's my understanding that the product you purchased are the XW-41s.
After you.
Yes. Forty-two hundred units.
What kind of guidance are they currently equipped--?
They all need to be upgraded with VOLCON systems.
Launch platforms?
Ground-based vehicles and fixed-wing aircraft.
So you understand I have a terminal deadline.
First of February, yes.
-Can you meet it? -To be sure.
But you must arrange for the end-user certificates, transport....
We'll arrange for it all.
Where would the work be done?
Cyprus. I've a facility there.
We would start retrofitting the worms within a day of their arrival.
So if you deliver them to me within the next two weeks...
...we'll meet your deadline.
I'm concerned that we limit any and all knowledge of your involvement.
If we structure my involvement through a thick veil of shells...
...I don't foresee any complications.
-Sorry? -You. Come here now.
Usually we would involve our import partners from Russia.
What? I'm just a tourist.
-Now, you must leave. -Could you get that light out of--?
Get your fucking--
So shall we discuss numbers?
There is a more salient deal point...
...that needs to be resolved before we can do that.
And what point is that?
The point of fidelity.
I know you provided the Israeli government...
...with the countermeasures to this guidance system.
Last year alone...
...I did more than 300 million in business with the Israelis.
I would never put that at risk.
How can I trust you not to divulge this information to anyone else?
It's mutual interest, not trust...
...that will be the bond of our relationship.
Your compensation will be held in an escrow account.
--released until our clients pay in full.
And those are the terms.
The payout structure--
The transfers will be begun by tomorrow morning.
Ehames will contact you with the number for the escrow account.
So ends the bloody business of the day.
We're closed. I need you and Ehames here tomorrow...
...to work out all the details with Sunay's people.
Yes. We're on our way home.
Wilhelm?
Wake up.
Who are you?
I'm Louis Salinger.
You don't have the authority to arrest me.
Who said anything about arresting you?
-What do you want? -I want some fucking justice.
Wait, wait. Wait. Executing me won't change anything.
There will be 100 other bankers to take my place.
Everything will continue.
I mean, I don't usually fall back on... You know, it's women's issues.
But child proofed - how? Gates and stuff? Dude, she did the drawers.
We don't even know if this fertility thing's gonna work. She's screwed in these little jobbies
She's screwed in these little jobbies where you can't even open the drawers.
-At all? -No.
-At all? -No. They open an inch, then you gotta dig your finger in.
-It's a nightmare. -I guess sooner or later...
Yeah, well, a lot later. She did the upper cabinets.
The kid'll be 30 before he can reach them. Assuming, you know, we have a kid. ANNOUNCER: Attention...
It is natural for her to feel protective. Don't even... You have women's issues.
Don't even... You have women's issues. Please. You of all people.
Oh, come on. It's a jinx. It guarantees that we won't get pregnant.
And it takes me about 20 minutes to get a fucking beer.
Guys. Guys! Stockholm went south.
Seriously? I thought they were looking good.
What cracked?
I haven't seen the footage. Word's just going around.
Well, that's never been a stable scenario. Everyone knows you can't trust Swedes.
That means there's just Japan. Japan and us.
It's not the first time it's come down to that.
Japan has a perfect record. We're number two. We try harder.
-But, guys, if we fail... -Please.
We haven't had a glitch since '98.
We know what we're doing, Lin. Or we have it written down somewhere.
You guys better not be messing around in there.
Ooh. Does this mean you're not in the betting pool this year?
Big money. I'm just saying, it's a key scenario.
No, I hear what you're saying. In '98, it was the chem department's fault, right?
Where do you work, again? Wait, it's coming back to me now.
It's gonna be a long weekend if everyone's that puckered up.
So you wanna come over Monday night? I'm gonna pick up some power drills - liberate my cabinets.
I'm gonna pick up some power drills - liberate my cabinets.
Are you even listening to me?
Ugh, Professor Fuckwad.
Why haven't you stuck that asshole's picture on the dartboard yet?
It's not that simple... Oh, my God! Your hair. It's blond.
Oh, my God! Your hair. It's blond. Very fabulous, no?
-I can't believe you did it. -But very fabulous, right?
Hurry up with the 'very fabulous' - I'm getting insecure about it now.
God, no, it looks awesome.
-Curt's gonna lose it. -Oh, Curt's gonna thank me.
And so will you while we're burning this picture.
Oh, not ready. Seriously, this isn't his fault.
What's not his fault?
Fucking his student or breaking up with her by email?
-I knew what I was getting into. -Oh, please.
You know what you're getting into this weekend?
This! And if Holden's as cute as Curt says he is,
possibly getting out of it. That is the last thing that I want.
If this is a set-up, I'm gonna have no fun at all.
I'm not pushing. But we're packing this!
Which means we definitely won't have room for...
What if I get bored? These will help?
'Soviet Economic Structures'? 'Aftermath of the Cold...' Oh. No! We have a lake and a keg.
Oh. No! We have a lake and a keg.
-No more learning! -Think fast.
-BOTH: Oh! -Faster than that. (TYRES SCREECH)
Sorry. Sorry. Move along.
-Nice! -Is that Holden?
We'll be right down. He just transferred from State.
Best hands on the team. He's a sweet guy.
-And he's good with his hands. -Hey, I'm kind of seeing this girl,
but you're way blonder than she is.
But I was thinking, you know, maybe... What is this? What are these? What are you doing with these?
What is this? What are these? What are you doing with these?
OK, I get it. I'll leave the books. No, no, who gave you these? Who taught you about these?
No, no, who gave you these? Who taught you about these? I learned it from you, OK? I learned it from watching you!
I learned it from you, OK? I learned it from watching you! (LAUGHS)
OK, seriously, Professor Bennett, he covers this whole book in his lectures.
You should read this.
Gurovsky. Now, this is way more interesting.
Also, Bennett doesn't know it by heart so he'll think you're insightful.
And you have no pants. Oh, shit!
-That pretty much it? -Fucking better be.
You know, Jules, it's a weekend, not an evacuation.
Trust me when I say there is nothing in those cases you won't be glad I brought.
there is nothing in those cases you won't be glad I brought.
I'm shutting right up.
Oh, my God.
Marty?
Fuck is wrong with you, bro?
People in this town drive in a very counterintuitive manner.
That's what I have to say.
Do you wanna spend the weekend in jail?
'Cause we'd like to check out my cousin's country home.
Marty, honey, that's not OK.
Statistical fact -
cops will never pull over a man with a huge bong in his car.
Why? They fear this man.
They know he sees further than they...
..and he will bind them with ancient logics.
Have you gone grey?
You're not bringing that thing in the Rambler.
What? A giant bong in your father's van?
What are you, stoned? (CHUCKLES)
Hey, man.
Dana, you fetching minx!
You have any food?
-Everybody ready? -Whoo! Yeah.
-Yeah! -Yeah? OK, I'm ready!
Let's get this show on the road! Fuck, yeah!
Nest is empty. We're right on time.
JULES: I hope this is the right road.
It doesn't even show up on the GPS. It is unworthy of global positioning.
That's the whole point. Get off the grid, right?
No cell phone reception, no traffic cameras.
Go someplace for one goddamn weekend
where they can't globally position my ass, man.
This is the whole issue.
-Is society crumbling, Marty? -No. Society is binding, right?
It's filling in the cracks with concrete.
Everything's filed or recorded or blogged, right?
Chips in our kids' heads so they won't get lost.
Society needs to crumble. We're all just too chicken shit to let it.
I've missed your rants.
You will come to see things my way.
Identification, please.
(INDISTINCT P.A. ANNOUNCEMENT)
Mr Sitterson.
-Mr Hadley. -Thank you.
-What's your name? -Daniel Truman, sir.
This isn't the military, Truman. You can drop the 'sir'. But Sitterson does like to be called 'ma'am'.
But Sitterson does like to be called 'ma'am'.
-Or Honey Toes. -He'll also answer to Honey Toes.
You clear on what's gonna happen here?
-I've been prepped. Extensively. -And did they tell you
that being prepped is not the same as being prepared?
They told me. I'll hold my post, Mr Hadley.
Good man. (SIGHS)
SITTERSON: OK, system's online.
HADLEY: Acquiring target. Let's see what we got.
MARTY: Alright.
I'm thinking this thing doesn't take credit cards.
I don't think it knows about money.
I think it's barter gas.
CURT: Hello?
Hey, Holden.
-Holden! -I don't think there's any...
-You come here uninvited? -Fuck! Dude.
Sign says 'closed'.
Yeah, we were looking to buy some gas.
Does this pump work? If you know how to work it.
We also wanted to get directions.
Yeah, we're looking for... What's it called? Tillerman Road. Do you know if it's this way?
Tillerman Road. Do you know if it's this way?
Tillerman Road takes you up the hill there.
Dead-ends at the old Buckner place.
My cousin bought a house up there. You go through, like, a mountain tunnel, there's a lake.
You go through, like, a mountain tunnel, there's a lake. -Would that be the... -Buckner place.
Always someone looking to sell that plot.
You knew the original owners? Yeah, not the first.
I seen plenty come and go. Hell, I been here since the war.
-Which war? -You know damn well which war!
Would that have been with the blue and some in grey?
Brother, perhaps, fighting against brother in that war?
You sassing me, boy? You were rude to my friend.
(SCOFFS) That whore? What'd you say?
I think we got enough gas.
You got enough to get you there.
Getting back - that's your concern.
Well, good luck with your business, sir.
I know the railroad's coming through here any day now.
That's gonna be big.
Streets paved with actual street.
Fucker.
JULES: Guys, take a look.
CURT: This must be it.
JULES: Oh, my God, it's...beautiful.
One spider and I'm sleeping in the Rambler.
-I mean it. -(LAUGHS)
Come on. Give me a hand.
(LAUGHS) This is awesome. It is kind of cool.
You gonna kill us a raccoon to eat? I'll use its skin to make a cap.
JULES: Everybody get your suits on. In 10 minutes, we're heading to the lake.
CURT: Yeah.
MARTY: I was not informed there would be callisthenics.
Yeah, I don't think so.
No way.
No... Ah, shit.
Um... This is happening.
Hold up! (TAPS WALL)
JULES: You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
-That's just creepy. -MARTY: It was pioneer days.
People had to make their own interrogation rooms.
Who did your cousin buy this place from?
We should check the other rooms, make sure this is the only one.
'Cause you know Marty wants to watch us pounding away.
I didn't even like hearing that.
JULES: Don't be an ape, Curt.
How about we switch?
Not that I'd... I mean, I'd put the picture back,
but you might feel better if we switched rooms?
I really would.
Thanks. For being decent.
Oh, it's the least I could do.
Since Curt and Jules sold you to me for marriage.
They're not subtle.
Well, I'll just be flattered and keep it to myself.
Yeah, I'm not looking for...
But I'm still grateful that you're not a creep. Hey, let's not jump to any conclusions there.
Hey, let's not jump to any conclusions there.
I had kind of an internal debate about showing you the mirror.
Shouting on both sides, blood was spilled.
So you're bleeding internally? Pretty bad.
Well, Jules is pre-med. You should probably talk to her.
Oh, OK.
Wow.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Places, everyone. We are live.
Engineering, we got a room change. Polk is now in two, McCrea is in four.
Operations, do you copy? We need a scenario adjustment.
Miss Lin.
We've got the blood work back on Louden. Her levels are good, but we're recommending
Her levels are good, but we're recommending a 50mg bump of Rohyptase to increase libido.
-Sold. -Do we pipe it in
or do you wanna do it orally?
-Ask me that again, only slower. -You're a pig.
Guess how we're slowing down cognition. I don't know.
-The hair dye. -Dumb blonde. Very artistic.
Works its way into the blood, through the scalp. Very gradual.
Chem department keeps their end up. I'll see it when I believe it.
-MAN: Control? -Yeah, go ahead.
I have the harbinger on line two. Oh, Christ. Can you take a message?
Oh, Christ. Can you take a message?
Ah, I don't think so. He's really pushy.
(MOUTHS WORDS)
Um, to be honest, he's kind of freaking me out.
-OK. Put him on. -(CLICK!)
Mordecai, baby, what's happening? How's the weather up top?
The lambs have passed through the gate. They are come to the killing floor.
Well, you're doing a great job out there.
By the numbers, man. You got us started off just right.
So we'll talk to you later, OK?
Their blind eyes see nothing of the horrors to come.
Their ears are stopped.
They are the gods' fools.
Well, that's how it works.
MORDECAI: Cleanse them. Cleanse the world of their ignorance and sin.
Bathe them in the crimson of... Am I on speakerphone?
No. Absolutely not.
Speakerphone, no. No, I wouldn't do that. Yes, I am. I can hear the echo.
Yes, I am. I can hear the echo.
Oh, my God. You're right. Hang on one second, I'll take you off.
MORDECAI: That's rude. I don't know who's in the room.
-Fine. There. -(CLICK!) -You're off. -(OVER SPEAKERPHONE) Thank you.
-You're off. -(OVER SPEAKERPHONE) Thank you.
Don't take this lightly, boy.
It wasn't all by your numbers.
The fool nearly derailed the invocation with his insolence.
The ancient ones see everything. -And they will not be... -(SITTERSON GIGGLES)
I'm still on speakerphone, aren't I? (ALL LAUGH)
HADLEY: Oh, my God, Mordecai!
I can't believe it, it did it again!
-Mordy? -(LAUGHS) What happens next?
Oh! That's cold! Whoo! That's the cold...
JULES: Yeah? How cold? Is it worth it?
Come on, Jules. Life is risk.
Yeah, I might just risk lying out in the sun for a while.
Boo. -Hey, what is that? -What?
-In the lake, right there. -Oh, come on.
-In the lake, right there. -Oh, come on. No, I'm serious. Right there. There! There!
No, I'm serious. Right there. There! There! God, looks just like my girlfriend! (SCREAMS)
-(LAUGHS) -Oh, my God!
There's something else in the lake!
-It's a gorgeous man! -I'm gonna kill you!
Don't kill the gorgeous man! -We're endangered! -(SCREAMS)
Alright, last chance. It's post time. Dig deep, people. Betting windows are closing. OK.
Dig deep, people. Betting windows are closing. OK. HADLEY: OK, who's still out?
Ah, let's see. We got Engineering, we got R & D, we got Electrical.
Did you see who they picked?
They're practically giving their money away.
You should talk, Aquaman. (CHUCKLES)
-What do you mean? -Ah, nothing.
OK, alright.
I'm not even sure we have one of these. Zoology swears we do.
They'd know. OK. Alright, people.
Hey, what do you got?
No, they've already been picked. -What? No. Who took them? -Maintenance.
-What? No. Who took them? -Maintenance.
Maintenance? They pick the same thing every year. What do you want from me?
What do you want from me? If they were creative, they wouldn't be in Maintenance.
You'll have to split this if you win. You wanna switch?
Um, I don't know, I don't know. What do you think?
More than anything, I just want this moment to end.
Not betting? Not for me. Thanks.
Seems a little harsh, doesn't it?
It's just people letting off steam.
This job isn't easy however those clowns may behave.
Does the director... Do they know about this downstairs?
The director doesn't care about this stuff.
As long as everything goes smoothly upstairs,
as long as the kids do as they're told. But then it's fixed.
No, no, no.
How can you wager on this when you control the outcome?
No, we just get 'em in the cellar. They take it from there.
No, they have to make the choice of their own free will.
Otherwise the system doesn't work.
It's like the harbinger.
It's this creepy old fuck, practically wears a sign 'You will die'.
Why do we put him there? The system.
They have to choose to ignore him
and they have to choose what happens in the cellar. Yeah, we rig the game as much as we need to,
Yeah, we rig the game as much as we need to,
but in the end, they don't transgress... They can't be punished.
So what's it gonna be, Truman? You in? Window's closing.
I'm fine.
OK. That's it, gang!
The board is locked! -Let's get this party started! -(OTHERS CHEER)
Let's get this party started! (HIP-HOP PLAYS)
-CURT: There you go. -MARTY: OK, my turn.
-CURT: There you go. -MARTY: OK, my turn. Jules.
Truth or dare?
-Let's go dare. -Alright.
I dare you to make out with... Please say Dana, please say Dana, please say Dana.
Please say Dana, please say Dana, please say Dana. That moose over there.
Marty, have you ever seen a moose before?
Whatever that mysterious beast is.
-That's a wolf. -That's clearly a wolf.
I'm living in a womb of reefer. Leave me alone.
-(BOTH LAUGH) -Jules... ..I dare you to make out with that wolf.
No problem.
Who? Me?
Well, yes, I am new in town.
How did you know? (LAUGHS)
Oh, my God, that is so sweet of you to say.
-I just coloured it, in fact. -(OTHERS LAUGH)
No, no, no. There's no need to huff and puff.
I'll let you come in.
Thank you.
-MARTY: Yeah. -Alright.
Yeah, baby! Whoo!
JULES: Now, then.
-Dana. -Truth.
What's that supposed to mean? I'm just skipping ahead.
You're gonna say dare,
she's gonna dare you to do something you don't like
and then you'll puss out and say that you wanted truth all along.
Really?
OK, Jules, dare. -(BANG!) -(GASPS)
What the hell was that?
DANA: It's the cellar door.
The wind must've blown it open. MARTY: Ah, that makes what kind of sense?
What do you think is down there?
Why don't we find out?
Dana.
I dare you.
How long do I have to stay down here? CURT: Oh, you know, just till morning.
HOLDEN: Dana.
You OK? Yeah.
Sorry, I just scared myself.
Well, you called for help. That voids the dare. -Take your top off. -Tsk.
CURT: What? I don't make up the rules.
Oh, my God.
JULES: Look at all this.
Uh, guys... ..I'm not sure it's awesome to be down here.
Guys?
Dude, seriously, your cousin is into some weird shit.
Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure this ain't his.
Maybe it was the people who put in that mirror thing.
DANA: Some of this stuff looks really old. It's beautiful.
MARTY: Maybe we should go back upstairs.
I dare you all to go upstairs.
Guys?
Guys, listen to this.
(READS) "April 4. "Father was cross with me and said I lacked the true faith.
"I wish I could prove my devotion
"as Judah and Matthew proved on those travellers."
What is that?
Diary of Anna Patience Buckner, 1903.
"Mama screamed most of the night.
"I prayed that she might find faith "but she only stopped when Papa cut her belly
"but she only stopped when Papa cut her belly "and stuffed the coals in.
"Judah told me in my dream "that Matthew took him to the black room,
"so I know he is killed.
"I want to understand the glory of the pain like Matthew.
"But cutting the flesh makes him have a husband's bulge
"and I do not get like that."
-Jesus. Can we not...? -No. Go on.
-Why? -I want to know.
"I have found it. "In the oldest books. The way of saving our family.
"My good arm is hacked up and et, "so I hope this will be readable.
"That a believer will come and speak this to our spirits.
"Then we will be restored and the great pain will return."
And then...then there's something in Latin.
OK, I'm drawing a line in the fucking sand here -
do not read the Latin. (HAUNTING FEMALE WHISPER) Read it.
What the fuck? FEMALE: Read it out loud.
-"Dolor..." -No, no, no.
-Stop being a fucking baby. -Curt!
CURT: It's a diary.
It doesn't even mean anything. -Dana! -"Dolor supervivo caro.
-Dana! -"Dolor supervivo caro.
"Dolor sublimis caro.
"Dolor ignio animus." (CHILLING MUSIC)
-We have a winner! -(CHEERING) It's the Buckners, ladies and gentlemen!
The Buckners pull a 'W'.
Alright, that means that congratulations go to Maintenance!
-Yeah! -(OTHERS GROAN)
Who share the pot with Ronald the intern. -Yeah! Whoo! -That's not fair.
-Yeah! Whoo! -That's not fair. -I had zombies too. -Yes, you did. Yes, you had zombies.
Yes, you had zombies. But this is 'Zombie Redneck Torture Family', see?
They're entirely separate species.
Like the difference between an elephant and an elephant seal.
Yeah. Well, there's always next year.
TRUMAN: They're like something from a nightmare.
No. They're something nightmares are from.
Everything in our stable is remnant of the old world.
Courtesy of you-know-who.
Monsters. Magic. Gods.
You get used to it.
Should you?
Oh, man. I'm sorry.
-He had the conch in his hands. -I know.
A couple more minutes, who knows what might've happened?
I am never gonna see a merman. Ever.
Dude, be thankful. Those things are terrifying.
And the clean-up on them is a nightmare.
-So the Buckners. -Yeah.
Well, they may be zombified, pain-worshipping backwoods idiots..
But they're OUR zombified, pain-worshipping backwoods idiots.
-With a 100% clearance rate. -True.
So should we call Japan? Tell them to take the rest of the weekend off?
Yeah, right. They're Japanese. What are they gonna do - relax?
I'd just like to see them fall on their asses for once.
Oh, God, don't even joke. Every other branch has airballed.
We need the Japanese crew to get it done. There's too much riding on this.
Fuck, yeah, baby.
This is so classy.
Come on, like you wouldn't want a piece of that.
Can we not talk about people in pieces anymore tonight? Oh.
Are you feeling lonely, Marty?
Marty and I were sweeties in our freshman hall.
We made out once. (CHUCKLES)
I never did buy that ring.
But we're still... ..close.
I have a theory about all this.
That's our cue to bail.
Tommy Chong here has a theory. Come on, baby.
Don't worry, you can tell it to egghead here
if he's not too busy devirginising Dana. (LAUGHS)
Jules, do you wanna go lie down?
That's exactly the point. Come on, mush, mush.
JULES: Don't push me around. CURT: Not around, baby. Straight line.
You seriously believe nothing weird is going on?
Conspiracy?
The way everybody's acting.
Why is Jules suddenly a celebu-tard?
And since when does Curt pull this alpha-male bullshit?
I mean, he's a sociology major.
He's on full academic scholarship and now he's calling his friend an egghead?
Curt's just drunk.
I've seen Curt drunk.
Jules too. Well, then maybe it's something else.
Wha... You're not seeing what you don't want to see.
Puppeteers.
-Puppeteers? -Pop-Tarts?
Did you say you have Pop-Tarts?
Marty, I love you, but you're really high.
We are not who we are.
I'm gonna go read a book with pictures.
Thank you. (TRANSLATES) "The pain outlives the flesh.
"The flesh returns..." or re... "..has a meeting place."
What is that?
The Latin that you read in the basement. You speak Latin?
Not well. Not since 10th grade.
Weird how it all comes back.
Well, it's a weird kind of night.
I'm sorry about tonight. Everybody...
Do I lose points if I tell you I'm having a pretty nice time?
No. You can tell me that.
What are you running away for?
Don't spill on me!
Did I get a little beer on your shirt?
I guess it'll have to come off, huh?
Not here.
Baby, come on. We're all alone.
-I'm chilly. -(ALL GROAN)
OK, guys, that's it. Let's go. We've got a job to do.
Your basic human needs disgust me. Get out of here.
Do we have temperature control in this sector?
On it.
Engaging pheromone mists.
It's so dark. Take me inside?
Come on, this is why we came here.
It's romantic.
OK, baby, let's see some boobies.
Show us the goods.
Does it really matter if we see her?
We're not the only ones watching, kid. Gotta keep the customer satisfied.
You understand what's at stake here?
Score.
-Jules! -(SCREAMS)
Fuck!
-Curt! -Ahh!
-Ahh! -CURT!
No. No.
Please! Please!
No! No!
-No! -(SCREAMS)
This we offer in humility and fear.
For the blessed peace of your eternal slumber.
-As it ever was. -As it ever was.
Nemo, man, you gotta wake up. Your shit is topsy-turvy.
(WOMAN WHISPERS) I'm gonna go for a walk.
OK. I swear to fucking God, somebody is talking.
Or I'm pretty sure someone is.
-Oh... -I'm gonna go for a walk.
Enough! What are you saying? Huh?
What do you want?
You think I'm a puppet, huh? You think I'm a puppet,
gonna do a little fucking puppet dance!
I'm the boss of my own brain, so give it up.
I'm gonna go for a walk.
I don't wanna...
I mean, I've never...
-I don't mean 'never'. -Hey.
Nothing you don't want.
He's got a husband bulge.
I thought there'd be stars.
We are abandoned.
-Fuck! -Fucking run!
-What the fuck ha... -Ahh! -Curt! -Dead bitch!
-Jesus, what happened? -Curt!
MARTY: The fuck! Curt, what the fuck?
Where are you hurt? Is all of this from you?
-It's OK! Curt, you're OK! -Where's Jules?
She's gone.
We've gotta get out of here. No. No. -Wait. -Dana, don't open that.
I'm not leaving here without Jules.
That dead girl's out there!
CURT: Dana, come on!
-What is that thing? -Fuck!
I don't know, but there's more of them. More of them?
MARTY: I saw a young girl all zombied like him. But she was missing an arm.
Oh, my God. Patience. The diary.
Look, we gotta lock this place down. -He's right. -We'll go room by room.
-He's right. -We'll go room by room. Barricade every window and door. We gotta play it safe.
Barricade every window and door. We gotta play it safe.
No matter what happens, we have to stay together.
Ah, fuck! Calm down. Watch the master work.
This isn't right. HOLDEN: What? What's the matter?
This isn't right. We should split up.
We can cover more ground that way.
Yeah.
Yeah. Good idea.
Really? Whoa! Alright, guys, you guys get in your rooms.
Lock 'em in.
What the fuck?
What the...?
What the fuck?
Uh-oh. That's not good. Out of the way. Out of the way. Out of the way.
Chem department, I need 500cc of Thorazine pumped into room three.
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no. -Stand by, chem.
Judah Buckner to the rescue.
What the fuck?
Fuck! What the fuck?!
Oh, my God.
I'm on a reality TV show.
My parents are gonna think I'm such a burnout.
No! No! NO!
Help me! Help me!
Must be getting excited downstairs. Greatest show on earth.
-Somebody help! -(CRASH!) (SCREAMS)
Come on! -(GASPS) -(EXHALES)
-Use the bed! -Come on! Come on!
Holden.
-It's empty. -Go.
-(DOORKNOB RATTLES) -Curt? -Unlock the door. -I can't. Get to the basement.
-Unlock the door. -I can't. Get to the basement.
This is the black room. Nice.
From the diary.
This is where he killed them.
This is where he kills us.
No way. No. He's not gonna kill us.
We just gotta find a door. OK?
Let's just check the walls, OK?
Curt? I mean, there's gotta be some... -(GRUNTS) -(GASPS)
You like pain?
How's that work for you?
HADLEY: These fucking zombies.
Remember when you could just throw a girl in a volcano? SITTERSON: How old do you think I am?
SITTERSON: How old do you think I am? (BLOOD TRICKLES)
-Let's move! Come on! Go! -(SCREAMS)
What about Marty? They got him.
(ALL CHEER)
Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! -(INTERCOM BEEPS) -(PUSHES BUTTON)
-You seeing this? -Perfect record, huh?
The Japan crew should've had this in the bag. They fucked us.
How hard is it to kill nine-year-olds? Zero fatality. Total wash.
I'm telling you, you want good product, you gotta buy American.
Any word from downstairs? Downstairs doesn't care about Japan. The director trusts us.
Downstairs doesn't care about Japan. The director trusts us. Hey, you just sweat the chem, Lin.
While these morons are singing 'What a Friend We Have in Shinto',
we are bringing the pain.
Yeah, and what the fuck's up with this guy's pot, anyway?
He's supposed to be drooling and instead he almost makes us?
We treated the shit out of it.
OK, we've got the Rambler heading toward the tunnel.
LIN: The fool's toast anyway. And so are we if you don't get this under control.
-Shit. -What? -'Shit' why? -Gotta go. Work to do.
-'Shit' why? -Gotta go. Work to do. You guys are humanity's last hope. If the ancients rise we...
You guys are humanity's last hope. If the ancients rise we...
-There's no cave-in. - What?
The fucking tunnel's open!
-Control to Demolition. -We're dark on the whole sector. Try to bypass it.
-What do you think I'm doing? -Open the door.
Look out! Get out of the way! Make a hole!
-What the fuck's going on? -We don't know.
Electrical said there was a glitch up top.
That tunnel should've blown hours ago.
-We didn't get the order. -Come on.
Right there.
Hadley, what is going on? Hadley!
Why hasn't the tunnel blown?
No. No, no, no. No fucking way!
Can't believe this, man. This ain't happening.
It's right there.
HOLDEN: Alright, we got any climbing gear? Ropes? Yeah. In my fucking dorm room.
Yeah. In my fucking dorm room.
We can't go back. There's no way across. What're we gonna do - jump?
Dude.
What? (ENGINE REVS)
Curt, are you sure about this? I've done bigger jumps than this.
You've got a smooth run
and maybe a 5-foot differential on the other side.
But you've gotta give it everything.
Curt.
Look, you guys, you stay in the Rambler. I'll get help.
If I wipe out, I'll fucking limp for help.
But I'm coming back here.
I'm coming back with cops and choppers and large fucking guns, and those things are gonna pay.
and large fucking guns, and those things are gonna pay.
For Jules.
Don't hold back.
(SNIGGERS) Never do. (REVS ENGINE)
NO! HOLDEN: Curt!
DANA: Oh! Oh, God!
Oh, God! (THUD AND CLANGING)
He hit something. There's nothing. What'd he hit?
Puppeteers.
Marty was right. Get in the van.
Dana.
Marty was right.
You're going back.
I'm going through. And we'll just drive. There's gotta be another road.
-Another way out of here. -It won't work.
Something will happen. It'll collapse, it'll wash away.
Then we just leave the roads altogether.
Drive as far as we can into the forest and we go on foot from there.
You're missing the point.
Please, do not go nuts on me, OK, Dana? You're all I've got now.
-I'm OK. -Good, 'cause I need you calm.
OK, no matter what happens, we gotta stay...
Goddamn, that was close! Yeah, photo-fuckin'-finish.
I don't understand. You're celebrating?
They're celebrating. I'm drinking.
But she's still alive. How can the ritual be complete?
The virgin's death is optional as long as it's last.
Main thing is that she, you know, suffers.
That she did.
It's so strange. I'm actually rooting for this girl.
She's got so much heart.
And you think of all the pain and the...
Tequila is my lady! My lady!
Come on in, guys! Come on in. Come on in. You're welcome.
Come on in, guys! Come on in. Come on in. You're welcome. Tequila! From darkness, there is light!
Tequila! From darkness, there is light!
I wish that I could do what you do. -Oh, my God. -Yeah, it's masterful.
-Oh, my God. -Yeah, it's masterful.
Oh, I don't know. You know, tonight was solid. I don't know.
MAN: Are you kidding? Classic denouement.
-When the van hits the lake... -I screamed.
-Right? -And the water rushing in
-and the zombies... -Primal terror.
I just think it would've been cooler with a merman.
Do you know if we get the overtime bonus on this one?
Accounting's over there. Ask them.
I don't need to. I already know the answer.
I'm an intern.
So I don't qualify for OT.
It's funny that you like the ballet
because I happen to have two tickets to your favourite...
You knuckleheads.
You almost gave me a heart attack with that tunnel.
Like I said, it wasn't our fault. We didn't get the order.
(LAUGHS) Alright, I'm just giving you a hard time.
-Come on, give us a hug. -Hey.
No, seriously, that wasn't our fault.
There was a glitch. Power re-route from upstairs.
What do you mean 'upstairs'? (PHONE RINGS)
Turn the fucking music off.
(SOFTLY) Hello?
That's impossible. Everything was done within the guidelines. The virgin's the only one...
The virgin's the only one...
No. I-I am not doubting you.
Which one?
-Marty. -Hi.
-Dana! -(GRUNTS)
Dana, come on.
Marty. Wait. We're going in the grave?
Dana, come on!
-(ELECTRICITY CABLES CRACKLE) -What is this place?
-(YELPS) -Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. OK. (BREATHES DEEPLY)
Yeah. I had to dismember that guy with a trowel.
What have you been up to?
Nobody else, huh?
Yeah, I figured.
You figured everything.
Oh, not at all. But I do know some stuff.
As in...
It's an elevator.
Somebody sent those dead fucks up here to get us.
Now, there's no controls inside,
but there's maintenance overrides in there.
And I think I can get it to go down.
Do we want to go down?
Where else are we gonna go?
Come on. Get in.
OK, OK, OK.
Ah! God, fucking zombie arm.
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God.
Huh? What?
Oh, shit. (THUD!)
We chose.
What? Oh!
MARTY: Fuck.
DANA: In the cellar.
All that shit we were playing with.
They made us choose.
They made us choose how we die.
We saw them go down the access drop. They have to be in one of these.
Internal security can... I don't care if it's not protocol. Are you fucking high?
I don't care if it's not protocol. Are you fucking high? It's the fool! Do not touch the girl.
It's the fool! Do not touch the girl. If he outlives her, this whole thing goes to hell.
Take him out first.
Clean-up says the prep team missed one of the kid's stashes.
Whatever he's been smoking's been immunising him to our shit.
How does that help us right now? What?
No, if you have a confirmed kill, take her out too.
There. 3606.
Gotcha.
Bring 'em down.
-(LIFT DOOR PINGS) -(BOTH GASP) -Step out of the elevator! -Why are you trying to kill us?
-Step out of the elevator! -Why are you trying to kill us? -Step out! Just the girl!
-What? -Just me?
Do it! Ahh!
Good work, zombie arm.
(FEMALE VOICE OVER P.A.) You shouldn't be here.
This should've gone differently,
ended more quickly.
I can only imagine your pain and confusion.
But know this,
what's happening to you is part of something bigger.
Something older than anything known.
You've seen horrible things.
An army of nightmare creatures.
But they are nothing compared to what came before.
What lies below.
It's our task to placate the ancient ones.
As it's yours to be offered up to them.
Forgive us
and let us get it over with.
Come on. Go in that room.
Army of nightmares, huh?
Let's get this party started.
-(WARNING BEEPS) -Hold fire!
-(MECHANICAL NOISES STOP) -Oh, shit. -(DING!) -(MONSTERS SCREECH AND SCREAM)
-(MAN SCREAMS) -Go! Go! Go!
-(INDISTINCT SHOUTING) -Move out!
-Get back! -Man down!
We need back-up!
-(MAN WHIMPERS) -MAN: What have we done?!
-(WOMAN SCREAMS) -MAN: Please don't...
Lead Officer Truman to security command, requesting immediate reinforcements.
Code black. I repeat, code black. Where the fuck are you guys?
HADLEY: Sector 12, down. Sector 8, down. Sector 3, down. Jesus Christ!
SITTERSON: Why aren't the defences working?
Where's the fucking gas?
HADLEY: Something chewed through the utility shaft connections.
-Something which? -Something scary!
The north exit is blocked. You can't go there.
The north exit is blocked. You can't go there. (MONSTER SCREECHES)
Go, go, go. Go.
Fuck! We're running out of time! It's on lockdown. I'm trying to bypass.
-(HIGH-PITCHED RING) -LIN: Hadley!
-Oh, come on! -(MONSTER GROWLS)
-My God. -God.
It's you.
-(GASPS) -No, no. Please, please, please. Please. Please. Please.
Kill him.
OK, Dana, come on. Dana.
Here, it's easier with this.
Look at these.
Five of them.
What are they?
Us. I should have seen it like you did.
This is part of a ritual.
A ritual sacrifice?
Great. You tie someone to a stone,
get a fancy dagger and a bunch of robes.
-Is that that complicated? -No. It's simple.
They don't just want to see us killed.
They want to see us punished.
Punished for what?
WOMAN: For being young.
It's different in every culture.
And it has changed over the years, but it has always required youth.
There must be at least five.
The whore. She's corrupted. She dies first.
The athlete. The scholar.
The fool.
All suffer and die at the hands of whatever horror they have raised,
leaving the last to live or die as fate decides.
The virgin.
Me? Virgin?
We work with what we have.
But what if you don't pull it off? -They rise. -Who does?
-They rise. -Who does? (LOW RUMBLE)
-What's beneath us? -The ancient ones.
The gods that used to rule the earth.
As long as they accept our sacrifice, they remain below.
But the other rituals have all failed. (BANG!)
The sun is coming up in eight minutes.
If you live to see it, the world will end.
Maybe that's the way it should be.
If you've got to kill all my friends to survive,
maybe it's time for a change. We're not talking about change.
We're talking about the agonising death of every human soul on the planet.
Including you.
You can die with them.
Or you can die for them.
Gosh, they're both so enticing.
Wow.
The whole world, Marty. DIRECTOR: Is in your hands, Dana.
There is no other way.
You have to be strong.
Yeah, Dana.
You feeling strong?
I'm sorry.
So am I. -(GROWLS) -(SCREAMS)
Marty.
Marty!
Hey.
You know...
..I don't think Curt even has a cousin.
How are you?
Going away.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry I almost shot you.
I probably wouldn't have.
Hey, no. Shh. No.
I totally get it.
I'm sorry I let you get attacked by a werewolf and then ended the world.
No.
Hey, you were right.
Humanity...
It's time to give someone else a chance.
Giant evil gods.
I wish I could've seen them.
And so, I'm sitting there staring at him, right?
He tells me to get my crunchy fucking fucknuts the fuck out of there.
You believe that shit?
-You know what I said, right? -No, what did you say?
-Shit. "Okay." -You fucking said, "Okay."
-Shit. "Okay." -You fucking said, "Okay." I'm sure you did.
Control Center, this is Stillwell 1215.
Go ahead, Stillwell 1215.
I'm about four cars out of 57th Street station...
...being delayed by a red signal light.
Should be green, Stillwell 1215. Yeah, tell me something I don't already know.
Yeah, tell me something I don't already know.
All right, roll through it slow, extreme caution, per the rulebook.
Yeah, cracked rail. Nine-hundred feet from the east end of the platform.
It's the goddamn cold. Metal contracts, you know that.
It's the goddamn cold. Metal contracts, you know that. I got it, I got it. How long it take to fix it?
I got it, I got it. How long it take to fix it?
Gotta put a plate on it. Two hours.
Thank you. Make it an hour and a half, I'll buy you a beer.
Shit, G.B. I hate to see you down here on the floor, man.
Temporary, baby. I'll be up there behind the glass before you know it.
I'm gonna need the R train... ...to switch over to the express tracks at 34th.
...to switch over to the express tracks at 34th.
-Which express tracks? -The one that Q uses.
Once they exit the 57th Street, they can switch over to the F Line.
Straight into Queens.
Once they get to Queens, they switch back at 36th Street to the R Line.
All you gotta do, suspend the W, N and R will pick up the slack.
I can't see where I gotta look.
Unlock the door. Do it now or I'll kill you. Do it.
All right, all right.
Shut up and walk.
First car, go.
See? I told you I could do this.
Big fucking deal, you did what you said you'd do.
All right.
Five minutes of peace.
-Yeah! -Nice!
-Nice. -All right.
There you go.
I'm on the train and I still got you.
-You still got me? -I got you. What are you doing?
You still got me?
Oh, my God.
Baby? Baby?
Give me the cutting key.
Cutting key.
Control Center calling Pelham 123. Come in, Pelham 123.
Why did you stop? You're all green ahead.
Control Center calling Pelham 123.
Control Center calling Pelham 123.
Why did you stop, 123? You got green ahead.
It's okay.
Life is simple now.
You just gotta do what I say.
Not now, okay?
Where are you from?
-Brooklyn. -You Irish?
Yeah.
I thought so.
Who's driving Pelham 123?
Maybe something fell on the tracks.
Wait. Are we going backwards?
42nd Street tower, I got a train wrong-railing...
...on the southbound Lexington Avenue Line just north of you.
Listen up, we need to stop and stay in-station.
All southbound locals just north of the 51st Street station.
The operator on 123 is Jerry Pollard.
I know Jerry Pollard. I went to motorman school with Jerry.
Pelham 123, come in to me, Pelham 123.
Pelham 123, Jerry Pollard, what's going on down there?
This is Control Center. What's going on, 123?
Get an express train to go alongside them, see what we see in the cab.
Yeah, this is South Ferry 105. I can't get my windshield wiper to turn on.
South Ferry 105, there's a circuit breaker right behind you for that.
What's going on?
Maestro, what's going on?
-Cop. -Excuse me.
-Fuck. -Watch your backs. Watch your backs.
When I say stop, stop it hard.
-Transit Police. -Stop.
Everybody sit the fuck down!
Down!
Sit the fuck down!
Jesus! We're getting reports of gunshots down the tunnel.
Sergeant Moran.
-Delgado, let's call off that express. -Got it.
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna fucking die, man.
Come on! Hey.
Everybody up! By the window! Come on, up, up, up!
Stand up! Stand up! Come on!
Move it! Against the window!
What the fuck is going on?
There was a cop. Bashkin shot him.
I think-- I think he's dead.
Put Bashkin on and find your fucking guts!
-Do it! -Fuck.
-What happened? -A cop. He's dead.
Put the conductor on.
-What's your name, conductor? -Regina.
Regina, baby, listen, you got a job to do, honey.
A job?
God put you on this Earth for one thing and one thing only.
You conduct those people off the train...
You conduct those people off the train... ...up to the platform. You got that? Let me hear it.
...up to the platform. You got that? Let me hear it.
Let me hear you do that.
Listen up, everybody.
We're gonna go back to the platform. I need everybody to--
Regina. Let's do it again.
Conduct those people.
Listen. Now, we're gonna head back towards the platform.
I want everybody to slowly get up.
-I'm gonna get you off this train. -Good.
Now, we're gonna be on the tracks, so if you don't need it, leave it.
Have been put on alert regarding--
Right here, right here. Right here, right here.
Cross right here, right here.
-Go. -Cross over right here, right here.
Let's go.
-Up the stairs, up the stairs. -Here you go.
-Every cop in the city is on the way. -Maybe it wasn't gunshots.
-Every cop in the city is on the way. -Maybe it wasn't gunshots. Train could be blowing breakers. Or the motor blew?
Train could be blowing breakers. Or the motor blew?
No, this is on purpose.
Fuck you.
-Yeah, I'm coming. -Get the fuck off the walls.
Shut the fuck up and come on.
Shit. Come on.
Ramos. Turn the power off from there down.
What?
Turn the power off from there down!
Okay, I got it!
My fucking lucky day.
Shit. What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
Pelham 123 to Rail Control Center. Do you read me?
Yes, I read you, Pelham 123.
This is Control Center. Who is this?
It's me, man. I didn't wanna call till everything was ready.
-It's not Jerry. -I don't know who it is.
I understand, I understand, Pelham 123.
Who the hell is this?
This is the man who's gonna rock this city.
This is the man who's gonna give the city a run for the money.
Look up. Look up at your screen and you tell me what you see.
You see what I've done?
I see it.
One car is much more manageable than 10 with the manpower I got. Motorman's gonna tell you about it. Tell him what we got.
Motorman's gonna tell you about it. Tell him what we got.
They got hostages, lots of them.
-And they got machine guns. -That's Jerry.
-That's Jerry. -Yeah, that's right.
Check me, do you understand that?
I check, I understand.
Didn't I tell you to knock first?
Good, because this is what we call a cash transaction.
Now, you understand commodities, don't you?
You know, pork bellies? Gold? Light crude?
Listen, no disrespect, but maybe I'm not the guy you should be talking to.
Oh, no, you are exactly the guy I wanna talk to.
Now, I want you to look at the ticker and you tell me...
...what is the going rate for a New York City hostage today?
You think a million dollars is too much? I do. I think it's corny.
Now get your calculator out. You got one?
-Do you have a calculator? -Yeah, we got one. I got one.
Okay, good. Add this up. You got $526,315 and 79 cents.
That's 526,315.79.
Now, times that by 19.
What do you got?
What is he, a goddamn accountant?
-That's 10 million? -What do you got?
That comes out to 10 million plus one cent.
That is a deal.
You call the mayor and you tell him the price.
You call the mayor and you tell him the price. And then you tell him I want it in 100,000 $100 bills, you got that?
And then you tell him I want it in 100,000 $100 bills, you got that?
I got it. What about the one cent?
Keep that, that's your broker fee.
Now, I want the rest in plain suitcases...
...the kind with the wheels and the portable handle, okay?
Now, this is not a futures contract. This is a spot trade.
That means there's a time limit on it. Okay, you got that?
Now, what do you think is a fair time limit?
You know, I don't know. I'm really just a guy--
Come on, give me a time limit. Give me a fair time limit.
-Thursday. -I was thinking more like an hour.
Now, what's your watch say?
Two-thirteen.
Oh, that's exactly what my watch says.
So at 3:13, I want that money here, motherfucker.
And after that, there is a late fee.
What do you think that late fee is gonna be?
Come on, tell me what it'll be.
You're gonna kill the passengers?
Oh, commodities is what I start to kill.
One for every minute past the deadline I am forced to wait.
They become more valuable this way...
...and still at the same price.
He's underground. He's never gonna pull this off.
-Don't tell me, tell him. -Who the hell is this guy?
-I don't know who it is! -Garber, just stay with it.
What's your name?
-What's your name, my man? -My name?
What's your name?
Tell him?
-Garber. -Garber, okay.
-Garber. -Garber, okay. Now, seriously, man, in 59 minutes...
...I'm gonna start killing passengers.
So my advice to you is to get on the phone, get the mayor notified now.
Listen, I mean....
I'm just a civil-service employee. I can't get ahold of the mayor.
That's your problem, not mine.
It's like, who's responsible for who lives and who dies in New York?
That's New York City's problem.
Get the fuck off the radio and notify the mayor, motherfucker!
Okay.
Nine months of this and I'm free. Next mayor gets inaugurated...
Nine months of this and I'm free. Next mayor gets inaugurated... ...I'm gonna be in Saint-Tropez on the beach with a piña colada.
...I'm gonna be in Saint-Tropez on the beach with a piña colada.
I will never have to ride the subway ever again.
-Never say never, sir. -Never.
All right, what's next for the afternoon?
East Harlem Elementary at 2:30.
You're to read The Cat In The Hat to the third grade.
Every time I go to the schools, I get sick. They all have runny noses.
Call Dr. Katz, tell him I want him waiting at the school, with a flu shot.
Mayor's office.
-He's in Car 3. -Yeah.
What happened?
Somebody just hijacked a 6 train.
It's stopped in the tunnel between 51st and 42nd.
Another idiot with a gun. What do we know?
It's unclear, but I have a car waiting for us downstairs.
Subway will get us there faster.
All right. Let the doors close.
Tell them we'll meet them at 59th Street.
Tell the conductor this is now an express.
-We're skipping the next five stops. -What?
-We're skipping the next five stops. -What? -I gotta get to work. -Hold on, hold on.
-I gotta get to work. -Hold on, hold on.
Everybody will get where they need to go, we'll make all the stops.
Maybe he's not such a douche bag after all, huh?
Funny.
Figures you'd be the one to get a call like this. Hostage negotiation team here in five minutes and the mayor's been notified.
Hostage negotiation team here in five minutes and the mayor's been notified.
-You gonna tell him? -Get the fuck out of here.
-You gonna tell him? -Get the fuck out of here. My shift's over in 10 minutes.
-What are you staring at? -Your face.
I'm trying to remember for when it's not here.
-You gonna start in on me? -Right, I'm gonna start in on you.
-You gonna start in on me? -Right, I'm gonna start in on you. -Don't fuck this up, Garber. -You wanna do it?
-Don't fuck this up, Garber. -You wanna do it?
It's your station, your call.
-Oh, it's my call now? -That's right. Your call.
Come on.
Pelham 123, come in, this is Rail Control Center. Are you there?
Gerber Baby boy. What's up?
Garber. Just wanted to let you know the mayor's been notified.
Are they gonna pay?
I don't know. I'm just the, what'd you call me? The broker.
No, no, you represent the city of New York right now, buddy.
I can tell you you're dealing with one of the all-time bureaucracies, I know.
-I mean, it takes time. -You'd better fix the bureaucracy...
...because when the time comes, these hostages...
...because when the time comes, these hostages... ...are gonna go real quick.
You got it, you got it. Any other demands?
Yeah, no fucking pizza for them, either.
No, I mean, are you guys, like, you know, are you terrorists?
Do I sound like a terrorist? Do I terrorize you?
Actually, you don't, but I mean, not that I ever talked to one. So--
So, what, this is just about money?
Oh, is there anything else?
There's not dying.
Yeah, well, you live, you die. You go with the current or you fight it...
...you all end up in the same place.
-Where's that, Jersey? -Yeah, you watch it. I was born there.
I'm just saying, you're up in the motorman's cab.
That means you're on the radio, which means that you're an easy target.
That means you're on the radio, which means that you're an easy target. You gotta know the drill.
I know that soon I won't be alone...
...and if I'm the first to get shot, I'm the first of many to get shot.
That's correct, but then you'd still be dead.
Dead is an improvement on a lot of things I can think of, buddy boy.
Sounds like he slept with my ex.
You know, we all owe God a death.
And I'm a man who pays his debts. Are you a man who pays his debts?
Yeah, yeah, sure. TV, cable, and my mortgage.
-That's a little like dying once a month. -You're married, you're a married man.
Maybe.
No, no, no. You're married, man. Married men have mortgages.
You got a mortgage?
I don't know. Why don't you tell me, then we'll both know?
I don't know. I'm sure someone out there loves you dearly and...
...you know, would be worried about you.
You're in the motorman's cab...
...you got no cover, sniper on the way.
Well, you know, circumstances are my protection...
...because right now, you know, hostages are good insurance.
By the way I see it, I'm pretty well-protected.
You know, this reminds me of being in a confessional.
Are you Catholic?
I'm married, you're Catholic.
-Maybe. I don't know. -No, you're Catholic.
And a good Catholic... ...would know he's got a trainload of innocent people.
...would know he's got a trainload of innocent people.
You don't wanna kill innocent people, do you?
A good Catholic knows that nobody is innocent.
And I'm not gonna kill all these hostages. I'd give up my leverage.
Well, I hope you know what you're doing.
It's running like a fucking Swiss watch down here, so don't worry about it.
So, what do I call you anyway?
Call me Ryder.
As in "train rider"?
Call me Ryder, with a Y.
Ryder.
I like you, Garber.
I do like you, man.
You may be the last friend I ever make.
Well, I hope you're wrong, Mr. Ryder. But, you know, I'm just a guy.
I'm just a guy on the other end of the mic.
Oh, you don't think this was meant to be?
You don't think this was fate, you and me?
I don't know. Things happen that lead to other things.
And maybe this was one of them, but that's it.
I never get excited about coincidence.
Well, you got 50 fucking minutes, so check me.
All right. 50 minutes, check.
And don't call me unless you got news.
-You got it. -Motherfucker.
G.B.
You're fucking good, man.
Okay. Move it the other way.
All right, come on, move it. The other way.
Okay, now move it back a little less.
Bingo. Got it.
All right, we got it.
-Who's talked to these jokers? -That would be me.
Yeah, under my supervision. Who are you?
Vincent Camonetti, N.Y.P.D. Hostage Negotiation Team.
John Johnson, Chief Transportation Officer.
Walter Garber. I'm Console Dispatch, right now.
What can you tell me, Walter?
His name is Ryder, with a Y.
And he's asking for $10 million by 3:13.
Looking toward the future. Say what he'd do if he doesn't get the money?
He said he'd kill a passenger every minute we go over.
-Starting at 3:13 p.m.? -3-1-3, yes, sir.
-Anything else? -He's smart.
If he's smart, why is he doing something so fucking stupid?
-On the train radio? -We can get him right here.
Any chance that we can get a signal down there?
We'd like to get him on one of our cells.
No, there's no chance, not where he is.
What's this? "Leverage, spot trade"?
Yeah, it's weird. He's like a money guy, like a Wall Street.
He talked about the passengers like they were commodities.
-"Catholic"? -Yeah, I think he's Catholic.
For chrissakes, Garber, you gonna tell us what his zodiac sign is now?
I'm just saying I think he's Catholic.
Man asked me about "Catholic." I wrote it down. I'm giving my opinion.
Unlike other people, I have an opinion.
Fellas, can we settle this dispute later?
-Absolutely. -Why do you think he's Catholic?
I think he's Catholic because he talked about original sin and confessions.
I wrote it down. I didn't know what else to do.
-Did he ask for a priest? -No.
Good. Anything else?
He sounded, the way he was talking, he sounded like he's not afraid to die.
Yeah, well, it's early yet.
-The calls are coming through...? -Right here.
-The calls are coming through...? -Right here. You hit the blue button, you can reach him.
You hit the blue button, you can reach him. -He'll come back to you. -Mind if I take your seat?
-He'll come back to you. -Mind if I take your seat?
-No, no, go right ahead. -Thank you, Walter.
You're welcome.
This is the six wire. You don't have to touch that one.
-Okay. -That goes around the room.
-Six wire. -Why don't you--
Just hit the talk here and then that mutes it.
Take the rest of the day off. Get out of here.
I thought I'd stick around, just make sure that....
Well, that wasn't a suggestion. So why don't you go home?
All right.
This is it. You got all the information over here about the 313.
-Wait for his call. -You want me to work it up right now?
You call headquarters, let them know that I'm here and I'm on the job. Okay.
I gotta take a piss.
So who's stopping you?
All right. We wouldn't wanna end up on any Amnesty International lists...
...so step up to the door, face out.
Open the middle door.
Do what you gotta do.
Can I jump down there?
-You gotta go or don't you? -I do, I gotta go.
Step up, my man. Let's go, let's go.
That kid's going places. All right, close the doors.
Pelham 123, come in.
-Pelham 123, please come in. -All right, everybody, sit down!
Who is this?
This is Lieutenant Camonetti. I'm with the N.Y.P.D. Hostage Negotiation Team.
This is Lieutenant Camonetti. I'm with the N.Y.P.D. Hostage Negotiation Team. I'd like to talk to you about the situation that we're in.
I'd like to talk to you about the situation that we're in.
Where the fuck is Garber?
Mr. Garber is a train dispatcher.
-This is now a police matter. -Yeah, well, I wanna talk to Garber.
I'm sorry, Mr. Ryder, but Mr. Garber is no longer involved.
Motorman, up!
-Put Garber on. -To be honest...
-Put Garber on. -To be honest... ...Mr. Garber has gone home.
Put Garber on the fucking line or I kill the motorman.
I guarantee you I am the best person for you to be talking to right now.
Give me a moment and I'll explain why.
You were always gonna be the first one to go.
Oh, Jesus!
Jesus.
Mr. Camonetti...
...you got 60 fucking seconds before I kill another.
-Okay? Fifty-nine, 58, 57.... -Get him. Just get Garber.
-Fifty-six, 55, 54.... -We're trying to locate Garber...
...ASAP, Mr. Ryder. Why did you do that?
Mr. Camonetti or whatever fucking greaseball name you got...
...the city of fucking New York killed Jerry, okay?
Fifty-three, 52, 51....
Garber. Garber!
Garber, he killed Jerry Pollard, man.
Come on, he wants to talk to you right now.
He's here. He's on the way.
Eleven, 10, nine, eight, seven....
-He's approaching the desk. -Six, five, four, three, two, one....
Hey, it's me, it's Garber.
Garber! You didn't say goodbye.
You killed Jerry?
No, the city of fucking New York killed Jerry, okay?
The biggest rat hole in the world fucking killed Jerry.
Okay? Now you can chalk another victim up to NYC.
-Now, can everybody hear me? -Yeah, we hear you, loud and clear.
Now you don't have to tell the cops...
...they don't tell me how to do it or how it's gonna be. I fucking tell them.
Don't you ever, ever leave me again.
Don't you ever, ever leave me again. Or I'll just have to hunt you down and I'll kill you.
Or I'll just have to hunt you down and I'll kill you. Now, you got 39--
Now, you got 39--
Thirty-nine minutes. Check me.
Thirty-nine, check.
This is Staley to ESU 2. What's your position?
ESU 2 approaching hostage car from south tunnel.
Go, go, go.
Ten-million dollars. I'll write him a check and get it over with.
-He wants it in cash. -I was joking, LaSalle.
But we've been given one hour to get the money together.
Ten-million dollars. Where do they get these numbers?
Actually, 10 is the limit, sir.
Why is that?
Request to the City Controller, he forwards it to one of our lenders...
...cash gets released to the Federal Reserve. Limit at any time is 10 million.
Some idiot with a gun wouldn't know that. I didn't know.
Some idiot with a gun wouldn't know that. I didn't know. -Well, you're very busy, sir. -How do you know that?
-Well, you're very busy, sir. -How do you know that?
Here he is.
-Henry, what's the situation? -They killed a hostage.
These guys may be the real deal.
I thought there was one idiot with a gun.
Multiple gunmen. They're not sure. They've got 18 hostages.
They'll kill more in an hour. That's the limit. They want you to know.
-What do we know? -Not amateurs.
They cut out a car, stopped on a rise.
They can see us coming 100 yards either way.
How long to get the money?
-I don't know. -Find out.
-You're not thinking of paying, are you? -I'm thinking of time and being ready.
Call the Controller. Tell them we'll pay.
What's with you and Garber, huh? Tell me about him.
Scheduled to work today?
-Yeah, absolutely. But.... -But what?
He's only had this particular job for a couple weeks now.
-Well, why is that? -Well, he's under investigation.
What?
-We were gonna suspend him-- -What's he being investigated for?
He went to Japan. He had to take a look at some new trains...
...and the allegation is that he took a bribe.
Took a bribe? Does he have a record?
-Not that I know. -You sure?
Yeah, yeah. I don't think so. I gotta take this.
The identity of the hijackers is still unclear.
The Hostage Negotiation Team has just arrived at MTA headquarters...
...to determine if this is a terrorist enterprise.
Is that what we are? An enterprise?
We're an enterprise.
Well, pilot reports that the aircraft has begun its descent.
This is Staley to ESU 4. What's your ETA?
Approximately two minutes south of target.
Why is the train called Pelham 123?
Comes out of Pelham Bay at 1:23 in the afternoon.
How did you end up with this call?
It's a Lexington Avenue train.
I got the Lexington Avenue desk. Came through my desk.
Can you think of a reason why you'd be targeted?
Someone wanna hurt you? Something against you or something?
No.
You recognize his voice?
No. No, as I said, it was a coincidence it came through my desk.
Did you pick this desk? Or was it assigned to you?
Did I...?
I said, did you pick this desk or was it assigned to you?
Can I take my coat off?
Doesn't make any sense.
-What doesn't? -Guy you're talking to.
He ain't a train dispatcher. Walter Garber.
-He's a big shot. -Big shot at what?
Rail Control. I mean, he runs things up there.
-At least he did before I went up. -His name is Walter?
Yeah.
Dude like that shouldn't be answering the phone.
-Mr. Ryder wants to talk to you. -Right.
Are you sure you don't have some sort of relationship with him?
I assure you, whatever relationship I have with him is better than yours.
Jerry, my friend, was killed while you were talking to Ryder.
Maybe that's a question you ask yourself instead of me.
I didn't have anything to do with this.
But what I have in you, Mr. Garber, is an unknown variable.
-Unknown variable? -Right. People's lives are at stake.
-Unknown variable? -Right. People's lives are at stake. -I understand that. -Excuse me...
...if I try to get more comfortable with you, okay?
It ain't working, but okay.
Now, with that in mind...
...would you agree to a consensual search of your house?
Take me 40, 45 minutes to get a warrant.
What....
Yes, okay.
Got him.
Walter Garber, right there.
No shit, look at this.
-Guy took a bribe, man. -Yeah.
Baby!
ESU 2, this is Staley. What's your overall status?
All positions secured.
All right, hold your fire until instructed.
Pelham 123, can you hear me?
Yeah, loud and clear, back at you.
All right, the mayor has agreed to pay...
...and they're getting the money together right now.
Good.
Well, you know, you got 28 minutes, so I advise him to make haste.
-I'm sure he will. -So is your first name Walter?
-Excuse me? -Your name, is it Walter?
-Yes, it is. -Good.
What are you doing dispatching trains?
I thought you were some sort of MTA big shot.
I work for the MTA. Today they put me at dispatch...
...and my bad luck.
I thought you didn't believe in bad luck. I said I didn't believe in fate.
I said I didn't believe in fate.
Do you believe in rigged contracts for new trains?
Look, what are we talking about this for?
-I need to know who I'm dealing with. -You need to know who--?
Yeah, I want to know who I'm dealing with. I mean, are you a bad penny?
Let me explain something to you.
Being accused of something is one thing.
Being guilty of it is something entirely different.
Well, agreed. But you gotta take me through this, my man.
You got to tell me from the top. This whole train thing. Come on.
All right, I started out in maintenance.
Platform maintenance, track maintenance, flagman...
-...conductor. -Conductor, really?
Yeah. And then motorman.
A motorman. How long did you do that for?
I drove them over six years.
I went to tower operations, assistant dispatcher, dispatcher.
I went to tower operations, assistant dispatcher, dispatcher. I finally ended up--
Yeah, you're assistant chief transportation officer or something.
-Right? -That's right.
And part of my job is to go out to the manufacturers, you know...
...the people who build the trains and bid on contracts for the trains.
Is that where you took the bribe?
The Japanese train over the Canadian train?
I did not take a bribe, all right? I was accused of taking a bribe.
I have not been proven guilty yet.
They haven't said yet. I mean, they haven't decided.
They haven't said yet. I mean, they haven't decided. Well, they got no proof. I don't care what they decide. It doesn't matter--
Well, they got no proof. I don't care what they decide. It doesn't matter--
Then is this when they demoted you?
That's correct. They demoted me, pending the outcome.
And now they're trying to humiliate you, is that right?
Motherfuckers.
Look, I know how these things work, man, okay?
Everything doesn't seem to appear like what it is.
But you've gotta be completely honest with me, man.
-Don't know what you're talking about. -How did you do it?
I didn't. I'm innocent.
Oh, you're innocent.
No, you're talking to a Catholic, man.
We've been over innocent before. Okay?
Look, I've been through all this, man. So just tell me, how did you do it?
I didn't do it.
Okay, that's it! That's fucking it!
Damn it.
-Kid. You. -Me?
No, no, you. Up. Get the fuck over there.
I don't know what you did to piss him off.
Garber. You know what I'm looking at?
-Do you know what I'm looking at? -No, I do not.
First there's my gun, and at the end of my gun-- What's your name?
-George. Everyone calls me Geo. -George. His friends call him Geo.
Got this '80s skateboard thing going.
He makes it work, but it's not gonna look too good in his casket.
Listen, Ryder, just slow down. We haven't reached the deadline.
No, there's no fucking deadline, man.
You just gotta tell me the truth.
-About what? -The bribe!
-Did you take it? -I didn't take a bribe.
Okay, you got five seconds to save this kid's life.
I didn't do anything.
-Five.... -Just wait a second.
-Four, three.... -Wait a second!
Two....
-Fucking tell him how you did it. -All right, okay.
-Say it. -I took the bribe.
How much?
Thirty....
How fucking much?
Thirty-five thousand dollars.
How did you do it?
I went to Japan to look at these trains.
It's part of my job.
I....
I don't get to vote, okay? I just recommend.
I chose what I thought was the best train...
...the Japanese had the best train, and I made my recommendation.
That's before you took the bribe.
Yes.
That was the train you were gonna pick anyway, huh?
-Yes. -And now you're fighting for your job...
-Yes. -And now you're fighting for your job... ...and they're trying to humiliate you?
No, no, no. I did what I did.
And....
And it's not, you know, it's not the MTA's fault.
What did you spend it on?
Look, what does this got to do with anything, huh?
What did you fucking spend it on?
I used the money for my kids, all right?
To pay my children's tuition.
I have a 17-year-old. I have a 19-year-old daughter.
And I used the money to pay for their college tuition, all right?
You know what, Garber?
You're my goddamn hero, you know that?
You got a kid here, you don't even know him, you saved his life.
That's brave, man. That's fucking heroic.
-Tell Garber thank you. -Thank you, Garber.
"Thank you, Garber, for saving my life."
Thank you, Garber, for saving my life.
You're welcome.
Sit down.
You're just like me, Garber. I fueled this city.
I fed it breakfast every morning, and now we're the bad guys.
I don't think so. I don't fucking think so!
-Hello, Therese. -Honey, look.
There are police here, Walt. They wanna search the house.
There are police here, Walt. They wanna search the house. They said you said it was okay.
They said you said it was okay.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay. It's-- Just let them in.
We got nothing to hide.
Is this about the investigation?
No, no. You watching TV?
This hostage thing. Yeah, yeah, I'm watching it.
Well, it's just that....
I'll tell you about it when I get home... ...but I'm in the middle of it now and they wanna do background checks...
...but I'm in the middle of it now and they wanna do background checks...
...on everybody involved here from the MTA.
-That's why they're at the house. -All right, okay. But you're okay?
I'm fine, I'm fine. Just let them in. I'll see you when I get home.
All right. Okay, bye.
I'm sorry, Walter.
I am.
Listen, don't let this guy bring you into his reality, all right?
That's what he wants to do. He hurts you, you get angry.
-He's got the advantage. Understand? -Yeah.
Just deflect, if you can.
-Okay? All right. -All right.
I hope they don't get fucking lost.
Fuck me! Ten-million bucks.
The joke is, say we dipped in, took some?
Bad guys would count it, come up short, probably kill us.
No shit.
Geo, what the fuck's happening?
Geo. Geo, what's going on?
Geo.
I'm a fucking hostage.
Listen to me. Stream it on our site. Call the news.
Shit.
Hey.
We've gotta do something. They're gonna kill us.
You got a plan?
I thought you'd have one.
Because I'm some tough-looking black guy?
I saw that ring on your finger.
That was a long time ago.
-Okay? -My husband had one just like it.
A severe sell-off underway...
...the Dow is down 450 points in very heavy trading...
...as Wall Street reacts to the terrorist attack... ...of the New York City subway system.
...of the New York City subway system.
-How's my hair look? -Fine. You ready to make a statement?
When I have something to tell them.
It's a leadership moment, sir.
I'm not running for re-election, for fucking president.
I left my Rudy Giuliani suit at home.
You're being selfish. It'll take 30 seconds to reassure them.
-Over there! -Mr. Mayor!
-Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor! -Will you be making a statement?
We're doing everything the situation demands.
I'm not gonna speculate right now. All right?
-Mayor, is it terrorism? -No.
Hey.
Mayor! Are they terrorists?
All right, all right, all right! Listen, nobody said anything about terrorism...
Listen, nobody said anything about terrorism...
...or a bomb, anything like that. Let's stop that right now, all right?
How about your divorce? Care to speculate how that's going?
Your divorce, sir. Been a lot of talk in the news lately...
Been a lot of talk in the news lately... ...that you have extramarital problems. Your divorce, sir!
...that you have extramarital problems. Your divorce, sir!
Put it on channel 15.
We got a girl in Brooklyn watching it on her boyfriend's computer.
-It's on the damn Internet. -What?
Hold on.
-Son of a bitch. -That's Ramos, isn't it?
That's Phil Ramos.
-Yes, it is. -Who's Phil Ramos?
He was a motorman. He killed a couple of passengers 10 years ago?
High on cough syrup, ran into the platform, went to jail for manslaughter.
Phil Ramos, I want everything.
Prison time, known associates, the works. Looks like it's from the floor.
-Should the Internet be working there? -No. No way.
Maybe that's how he knows about you. He Googled you.
Maybe that's how he knows about you. He Googled you. Or maybe Ramos told him, who knows?
Goddamn, it's the mayor. Hello, Your Honor.
Do me a favor, forget about those guys.
Easy for you to say.
You rather be one of those hostages?
No.
Listen up, I'll give you a crash course on hostage negotiating.
We're like rodeo clowns.
We keep the bull from focusing on what he'd like to do. Which is what?
-Kill a cowboy. -Exactly.
Now, he's got his deadline. You slow things down.
Preservation of life. That's our mission. Guy's already proven he's serious.
Next deadline's gonna give a chance again.
-How do we deal with that? -Get the money there on time.
If we don't, we pretend the deadline doesn't exist...
...talk through it, we buy time, get movement.
-Movement? -That's right.
Contradicts himself, inconsistency in his demand, you got some movement.
-Right. -All right, let's go out there.
This was the scene moments ago...
...outside the Rail Control Center in Midtown.
I'm not gonna speculate right now.
That is a beautiful suit he's got there.
Can't get it out of my head. I'm gonna die today.
Visualization's a very powerful thing. You keep thinking it, you never know.
Please let it be me who drops this motherfucker.
Hey, Garber. You there, buddy?
Yeah, I'm here.
A little birdie told me the mayor walked in.
Can I talk to him?
-Can he hear me? -How does he know I'm here?
-Does he have a camera in here? -Can he hear me?
We can, we can, we can-- We can all hear you here. Yes.
Okay, good. So tell him-- Tell him I wanna make him a deal.
Tell him I'll make him a deal right now.
Okay, all right.
Well, come on, speak up, Mr. Mayor.
Well, come on, speak up, Mr. Mayor. You're talking to your constituents.
We got a train full of registered voters. Don't you care?
Don't you care about your voters?
This is not a good idea. Don't talk. Don't engage with him.
I know what I'm doing, I've been doing this a long time.
Come on, buddy, speak up.
You gotta hit the blue button there, Your Honor.
Yes, this is the mayor.
Hey. Good to meet you, man.
And listen, tell me this, is this true?
I read that you make, like...
...one dollar a year to be a mayor of New York, is that true?
Yes, but at least it's honest work.
After taxes that's, like, 87 cents, isn't it?
Yes.
Don't bullshit me, man. It would take, like, 3000 years to pay off that suit that you're wearing.
It would take, like, 3000 years to pay off that suit that you're wearing.
What do you got, 20, 30 million dollars or something like that?
You don't get that without screwing someone, screwing everyone. I'm sure your wife knows something about that.
I'm sure your wife knows something about that.
You said you had a deal for me.
Yeah, I do. I wanna make you a deal.
I wanna tell you you could come down here...
...and I will trade you for all these passengers in the train, how's that?
Okay, you could save the lives of 17 New Yorkers.
Okay, you could save the lives of 17 New Yorkers. Now, that's a good deal.
Now, that's a good deal.
What do you think?
Give us a moment.
Okay.
I'll give you a moment.
You turn this into a circus, gonna get someone killed.
Now, you entered his world, exit it.
Okay, time's up. What's the deal?
It's a nice offer, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline.
Good. Because if you begged me, I wouldn't give you that deal, man.
Good. Because if you begged me, I wouldn't give you that deal, man. You think anyone cares about a philandering asshole like you?
You think anyone cares about a philandering asshole like you? New York would love me to pull the fucking trigger on you.
New York would love me to pull the fucking trigger on you.
Hey, Garber. This is the-- This is the guy that's trying to get rid of you.
-Keep talking. -Do you believe this shit?
-Calm-- -You don't think he...
...broke the same rules we broke?
-He knows it, I know it. -Calm him down.
-All right-- -He can eat shit.
-Calm him down. -You're--
-You're breaking up. -He can kiss my ass!
-You're breaking up. -He can kiss my ass! I like the deal. It's a good deal, but--
Fuck you, Mr. Mayor!
Now, I want my fucking money now! You understand me? Now!
-Just tell him the money's on the way. -The money's on the way.
Because he's, like, a used-car salesman, this asshole.
He can lick my bunghole, motherfucker!
One mistake and everyone has something to say.
Was she worth it?
Yes. You have nine minutes. How are you gonna get the money?
They're shutting down every intersection here to Brooklyn.
Phil Ramos, male, Hispanic, 39.
Sentenced two to four years for manslaughter...
...paroled last month from Clinton.
His PO, Justafarro, says he's living in a halfway house in Queens.
He's not an absconder, he made his appearances, his piss has been clean.
But he was a no-show at work today. He didn't call in, nothing.
He knows the system.
The perfect place in the subway to stop the train. He's been out a month. This wasn't planned in three weeks.
He's been out a month. This wasn't planned in three weeks.
Find out Ramos's cellmates, who worked in the laundry with him.
Call lists, visitors lists ASAP.
105 North Avenue.
-Shit! Look out! -Shit!
The market has tumbled nearly 7 percent... ...as investors continue to react to events....
...as investors continue to react to events....
They just came off the bridge.
Why didn't we send a helicopter for the money?
Now remember what I said about talking through deadlines.
We better have a plan B in case the money isn't there on the dot.
Put him on his heels. He knows things.
-We know things too, right? -Right.
Ask him about Phil Ramos. All right? Just get him talking.
Ask him about Phil Ramos. All right? Just get him talking. You can do it.
-Hey, Ryder. -The money here yet?
On the way.
Then what the fuck are you calling me for?
Actually, I just called to talk.
Oh, yeah? What do you wanna talk about?
You said that being in the motorman's cab...
...was a little like being in a confessional, right?
Yeah?
I was thinking maybe it's like being in a prison cell too.
What are you trying to say? That if I get caught, I'd better get used to it?
No, I'm just wondering. Maybe you're already used to it.
I'm wondering maybe that's how you meet a guy like Phil Ramos?
How the fuck he know that?
Why don't you tell me? Then we'll both know.
Why don't you tell me? Then we'll both know. After today's confession...
...you're gonna find your ass in prison too.
Which is my point. I want you to hook me up on the inside.
You know everybody. This way, when I come up with my heist plan...
...you know, I'll cut you in.
I can see I've inspired you. Okay, I got a story for you.
It might help you in prison. You wanna hear it? We got a minute.
I'd like to hear a little story.
So back in the day, when I was a high roller....
When were you ever a high roller?
I told you I fed this city breakfast.
Grits and eggs?
Something like that. Anyway, back in the day...
...I took this chick to Iceland.
Iceland? Is that where all the high rollers go?
Six hours from Kennedy and the nightclub scene is...
...you know, is intense.
I thought I'd take this chick to Iceland.
-What's her name? -Ludvika. She was Lithuanian. She was an ass model.
She was Lithuanian. She was an ass model.
She asked you what?
You heard of hand models?
Advertisement? Right, she was an ass model.
She did jeans and, you know, magazines and shit.
Anyway, it was Fashion Week in New York...
...and I took her to Iceland.
Ludvika, Lithuanian, ass model, Iceland, you took her to the ice.
-So what? -Well, for 500 bucks...
...they'll take you on a dogsled ride on a glacier.
-Dogsled? -Yeah. And you know the old saying:
If you're not the lead dog... -...the view never changes? -Right.
-...the view never changes? -Right.
Otherwise, you're always looking at the asshole of the dog in front of you.
Be funny in a minute when I get to that part.
It's funny now.
And it's 8 in the morning, we haven't been to bed yet...
...and we're tooling across this glacier...
...and I got this hangover that's creeping up the back of my neck...
...and guess what I'm looking at?
Obviously you're staring at the ass of the dog in front of you.
You got it. So this dog, out of nowhere, just lifts its hind legs up...
So this dog, out of nowhere, just lifts its hind legs up...
...and puts them in the harness there...
...and just takes a shit while he's running on his front paws.
So he's dumping and running all at the same time.
Now, that's multi-fucking-tasking if you ask me.
Get out of here. Did it hit you?
Shit always hits you, man.
I didn't know it at the time, but it was profound.
-Profound? You lost me. -Yeah.
Well, you know, when I went to prison later on, which you called...
...I had trouble going to the toilet.
...I had trouble going to the toilet. You know, a privacy thing.
And I couldn't take a shit. I was scared shitless, literally.
So you know what I thought of?
-You thought of the dog. -That's right.
-You thought of the dog. -That's right. I thought if that dog could do what it needed to do, so could I.
I thought if that dog could do what it needed to do, so could I.
Saved my fucking life.
Wow, that is profound.
Keep going.
And, you know, it's--
People adapt. It's like you and I, like today.
We didn't know how it was gonna start.
-Wrong. -Wrong what?
I knew exactly how it was gonna start.
Yeah, but do you know how it's gonna end?
-I'm tired of talking to you, Garber. -Wait a minute.
Call me when the money comes in. You got four minutes.
I don't know what he looks like, but he sounds good.
Fucking talk shit, what are you doing?
He's got a sexy voice though. He'd be my bitch in prison.
Where are we?
Less than 10 blocks away. We'll make it.
Fuck, look out!
Jesus.
Shit. The goddamn money car crashed on 1st Avenue.
Get a radio car, put it on the motorcycles, get it there.
Watch it. Easy.
Here, lean up here.
Hey, get that last bag.
-You got 22 seconds, Garber. -All right, we just had...
-You got 22 seconds, Garber. -All right, we just had... -...a little problem over here, that's all. -I don't care.
-...a little problem over here, that's all. -I don't care.
-Two minutes. -Just tell him it's here.
-Two minutes. -Just tell him it's here. -How's he gonna know? -I don't think we should lie.
-How's he gonna know? -I don't think we should lie.
-Tell him the truth. -No, tell him it's there.
Tell him the truth?
He's gonna make me do it.
-Ten, nine, eight, seven, six.... -Tell him the truth or lie?
-Tell him the truth. -Tell him it's there.
-Four, three.... -Tell him it's here.
-It's here. -Two, one.
The money's there, it's at 42nd and Vanderbilt.
Liar! Motherfucking liar!
Seven.
-One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. -Ryder. All right, listen.
-One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. -Ryder. All right, listen. -Lucky lady, up. -We made a mistake.
-Lucky lady, up. -We made a mistake.
-I think that's him. That's Ryder. -Lucky lady, up.
-I think that's him. That's Ryder. -Lucky lady, up. -Listen to me, it was an accident. -Keep talking.
-Listen to me, it was an accident. -Keep talking.
Ryder, we made a mistake. It's my fault. -The car crashed. -Tell him something!
-The car crashed. -Tell him something!
-That's why the money's not there. -Up!
-Up! -Wait.
-Fuck, no. -Get up!
Get back in line!
Ryder, like one minute it's gonna take.
Don't do this, for God's sake. It was an accident.
-Come on. -Wait.
It's the only plan I got.
Ryder, listen, it was an accident.
It was an accident, Ryder. We made a mistake.
It was an accident, Ryder! It was an accident!
Come on, motherfucker!
Oh, shit.
God!
Oh, my God.
ESU Team 1 to Sniper 1, do you have a shot?
That's your fault.
I got an easy shot. Please advise.
-Stand by. -Roger that.
Shit!
What the fuck happened?
Accidental discharge. I just got bit by a fucking rat.
It's accidental discharge.
Who? Who got shot? Was it Ryder?
No, it was Ramos.
-Sergeant? The money there yet? -What? Yes, yes.
-Are you there? -Get in here. Shoot any motherfucker that moves.
-That's an order! -Shit on your orders.
Can you hear me, Ryder?
Okay, now somebody else has to die.
Two people, maybe all of us.
Did you hear me?
I heard you, but you gotta understand, the circumstances...
I heard you, but you gotta understand, the circumstances... ...they're different now for you.
-You gotta rethink. -No.
You got to adapt.
No, I gave you instructions, and you know the consequences!
I mean, don't you have a plan B?
No, plan B is enforcing plan A!
And the minute you stop believing me, motherfucker, that's it!
I believe you, you gotta believe and understand those cops...
...are gonna be down and next to you any second--
Bring it, man! Let them unload their guns, I don't care!
And what's the point of that? What's the point?
I told you we all owe God a death.
And now it's two minutes past the deadline, two minutes.
Which means two people, almost three, have to go.
They have to die.
The money's there, Ryder. Nobody else has to die.
The money's there.
I don't know what you owe God. I can tell you, you can't pay him in cash.
You never see a U-Haul behind a hearse, Ryder.
The Egyptians tried it. It doesn't work. You can't take the money with you.
Ryder?
You can't take the money with you.
All this talk of God, I think I need to pray.
Give me a minute.
I can do that.
You did good, Walter.
What's the reality of getting in, ending this?
We'd have to be willing to accept heavy casualties.
It's a hard choice, but I say make it.
New York City does not have an acceptable casualty rate.
This is your area, what do you suggest?
We should buy time. So far this son of a bitch hasn't allowed us to.
We should buy time. So far this son of a bitch hasn't allowed us to. This might be the first time we got through.
This might be the first time we got through.
Trust your man? He confessed to a felony 20 minutes ago.
There are people down there who are alive because of him.
Until we change the rules or hope runs out...
...we should stick with the situation we have now.
Do what you need to do.
Hey, Garber, you there?
-Yeah, I'm here. -Speak up.
I'm here.
-I talked to God. -That's good. What did he say?
He said I should trust in him. All others, pay cash.
How soon can you get it down here?
From that station, it would take them about five minutes to walk it down.
-No can do. -About 10 minutes to walk it down.
No, no, no, I mean you, man.
How long would it take you to come down here?
Don't understand. What do you mean?
I mean you. I wanna meet you.
And if you bring it, I know the cops aren't bringing it.
Well, you know, I don't know how I'm gonna carry that money.
-It must weigh.... -Two-hundred and twenty pounds.
Stick it in a wheelbarrow or something.
Why are we discussing weight? Shouldn't you think:
-"Get the fuck out of there"? -Okay, get the fuck out of there.
Good, that's progress. Now, look, plan B. Your idea.
And part of plan B is you, Garber, deliver that money...
...or I kill another hostage, you got that?
You got seven minutes, buddy boy.
You got six minutes and 55 seconds, check me.
Do it!
I check.
And tell that sleazebag negotiator to call me when you've got the money.
You don't have to do this.
Finally somebody got their head out of their ass, huh?
Hello?
Hey, how you doing, baby? What are you doing?
What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm watching the thing, the hostages.
They mentioned you. They said a dispatcher was talking to the terrorists.
Yeah, yeah, they're not terrorists.
They are if they're down there waving guns.
Right, right. Listen, Therese, are you listening?
-I'm listening. -Look, I'm the one that--
You're right. I was the one that's been talking to them.
I knew it. I am so proud of you.
After everything, all this, them trying to fire you.
Them sticking you in a dispatch job and you--
Where are you?
I'm at a heliport.
I'm getting ready to get on a helicopter...
...because they want me to take the money down to the tunnel.
What? Are they crazy?
-It's real simple. There's nothing to it. -Over there.
What it is, is he knows I'm not a cop, so he wants me to come down--
Is it all right if I wait here? Can I wait here?
They need me to take the money down because they know I'm not a cop...
They need me to take the money down because they know I'm not a cop... ...and, you know, they're saying that he might kill somebody, honey.
...and, you know, they're saying that he might kill somebody, honey.
Well, then somebody has to die, because you can't.
He's talking to his wife.
I understand, baby. Listen to me. Listen to me.
-Just tell Angela at the meet-- -Let's go!
When she runs over the hurdles.
Tell her to run straight through the hurdles.
-Just like I always tell her, okay? -Come on, we gotta go.
You tell her yourself.
-Now, you listen to me. -Yeah, I'm listening.
Now, you do what you have to do, but we need milk.
So on your way home, I want you to bring a gallon.
Of milk? Okay.
You promise.
Why do we--? Why a gallon? Why not a half a gallon?
Just bring a gallon. A gallon.
Okay. Okay.
I can get a half a gallon, I'll get a half a gallon.
I gotta go.
All right, thanks, guys.
Put your-- Put your headset on.
You ever do anything like this before? You know, go in unarmed?
Yeah. Two years ago, Brooklyn.
Flatbush Avenue. I got the hostages out.
And the guy with the gun?
The guy with the gun, didn't end well for him.
-For the guy with the gun? -Yeah.
It's nice seeing it from this perspective, huh?
You can see what you're fighting for.
I love you so much.
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
Well, do you love me back?
Can't really talk right now.
All you have to say is "Yes."
That's a lot less words than saying, "I can't talk."
I'm having a really weird fucking day.
Oh, God.
If we'd anticipated this, we could have made a lot of money.
What kind of guy would you expect...
...to take a model to Iceland for the weekend?
-An ass model. -An ass model.
-A Wall Street guy. -A Wall Street guy.
He's here!
The one-hour time limit reported earlier has expired.
We're not sure who this is. It could be hostage negotiators or detectives.
Once we have any updates, we'll be back to you live.
-Camonetti. -How are you?
-Mr Garber. -Lieutenant Staley. -Pleasure. -Got radio set up to the train?
-Pleasure. -Got radio set up to the train? Set up right there.
You can talk to the train or to Rail Control.
Okay. Just do what he says, and remember everything you see.
Let's go.
So who the hell did you fuck to get this job?
Myself. It was easier than it looked.
Yeah, fucking yourself always is.
Pelham 123, come in. Pelham 123, come in.
Who am I talking to?
This is Lieutenant Camonetti. We spoke earlier.
Yeah, you're the greaseball. What'd you do, go out for a pizza?
Yeah, you're the greaseball. What'd you do, go out for a pizza? What's my money doing, man? Where is it?
What's my money doing, man? Where is it? Mr. Garber is in the tunnel. The money is two minutes away.
Mr. Garber is in the tunnel. The money is two minutes away.
Oh, Garber, man. That is a dependable man.
He's a good man too.
Absolutely. How about you, Ryder?
Everybody's got some good in them, don't you think?
Is this where you try to get through to me?
I don't think so, motherfucker. Now I got three instructions for you.
Number one, when this conversation is over...
...I want you to restore the power to the whole sector.
Number two, I want you to clear the local tracks...
...from 68th Street down to Coney Island.
...from 68th Street down to Coney Island. And when I say, "Clear," I don't wanna see no cops.
And when I say, "Clear," I don't wanna see no cops.
I want all the lights green.
Don't trip me up with a red, got that?
Absolutely.
And number three, don't play games with me...
...or I'll track you down and I'll fuck you in your greaseball ass, motherfucker!
Over and out.
Let's go.
All right.
-Know how to use one of these? -No.
It's really simple. Okay?
Safety's on, safety's off.
On, off.
Aim at anything you don't like, you pull the trigger.
-What if they frisk me? -We got that covered.
-That's it? -That's it.
It's got a false bottom.
It's gonna be this one. You got that?
-I got it. -Good.
Don't worry about it.
Just don't fuck it up.
Okay.
We got an ID on Ryder.
Dennis Ford. He was released from Clinton Correctional two weeks ago.
Did a nine-year stretch.
The last four on the same cell block as Phil Ramos.
His name shows up on an Icelandic Air passenger list...
...in September of 1998, right after Fashion Week.
Dennis Ford. You remember?
We used his case when he was running as an example of--
The kind of nonsense that we would clean up if I got elected mayor, yeah.
He ran a private equity firm.
His biggest client was the pension fund.
-He siphoned off.... -Twenty-million dollars.
He did a plea bargain for three. The judge gave him 10.
Maybe that's why he's so pissed off.
Judge gave him 10 years because we didn't recover all of the city's money.
Couple million unaccounted for. Seed money.
Seed money? For what?
For today, you play the terrorist card, you panic the market into a drop.
You know it's coming, you make a great deal with $2 million.
-What about the hostage money? -That's nothing...
-What about the hostage money? -That's nothing... ...compared to the money you could make. Let's get downtown to the SEC.
...compared to the money you could make. Let's get downtown to the SEC.
Check the trades, especially the put options.
-Good luck, Garber. -See you when you get back.
We got company.
Garber.
When you put your socks on this morning, did you ever think...?
Turn around, let him frisk you.
I was worried about you. I thought maybe you'd get lost...
...but then I remembered you were a motorman, so....
...but then I remembered you were a motorman, so.... These tunnels don't change much, do they?
Just the people in them.
-Are we good? -It's here. We're good.
All right, come on up.
Let's go.
Damn. You're taller than I thought you'd be.
You're good-looking too. Come on, sit down.
It's nice to meet you.
What do you weigh, about, what, 220?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 220 on a good day.
Oh, that's Ramos.
He's what you would have called the brains in the operation.
Dumb fuck.
So how long has it been since you've driven one of these?
-That's why you brought me here? -You're a motorman, right?
Once a motorman, always a motorman.
You play your cards right, you might get a part of the cut.
Well, this is--
It's a new train. I'm not certified on the new trains.
Well, I got faith in you, man. But I'm going to ask you one question.
You know, that thing when you told your wife about the 35 K...
...how did she react?
-We gotta talk about--? -Don't be sensitive.
-I'm not being-- -Did she freak out or what?
She wasn't happy, but she understood.
Well, that's love, right?
No, that's marriage. That's another thing.
You think they're gonna move that train?
Seems like a possibility. How are we with street-level, emergency exits?
I got a blanket.
I got radio cars and a man at every exit from 42nd to South Ferry.
We gotta go.
Hey, Camonetti.
Fucking greaseball, man.
Hey, greaseball, speak up.
I see red. I don't see green.
What's taking so fucking long?
Blanket is not tucked in yet.
Stall him. I need two minutes, buy me two minutes.
Haven't cleared the tracks yet.
Mr. Ryder, we'll be up and ready in less than two minutes.
We're gonna move forward here, okay?
We're gonna move forward, and if we get onto a red signal...
...and the brakes trip up...
...your friend Walter Garber's getting it in the head.
-You got it? -Yes, sir. I got it.
Let's roll, let's roll.
Hope you were bluffing.
Yeah, I'm bluffing, man. You gotta say what you gotta say.
You thought by coming down here, you'd be redeemed, didn't you?
God bless you, Garber.
You're more fucked up than I am.
At least the same fucked up.
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.
Let's go.
She's on the move.
Put some speed on it.
He's by me, headed south. Male, black, at the controls.
Motherfuckers. You're playing with fire, my man. I wanna see them green.
You're playing with fire, my man. I wanna see them green.
Turn to green or I'll put a hole in Garber's head right now.
-Do it! -We believe you.
We're moving as fast as we can.
-What happens if they run a red light? -It'll trip the brakes.
Coming up on the first one.
There, that's what I'm looking for. That's what I'm looking for.
Here he comes, right now.
Garber's driving the train. Sniper confirmed it.
What are you saying, he's in on it? There ain't no way.
Sniper killed Ramos, he was their driver...
...they probably need Garber to drive.
They get to Coney Island, they hit the trippers and the brakes will come on.
-Is that 33rd? -Yes, sir.
-How far to the signal? -About a tenth of a mile.
You stop when we get there. We're moving out. You got that?
I'm slowing down now.
Are they slowing down?
They have to. They're coming up to a signal point.
What is that?
You're the old motorman, you tell me.
-She stopped just below 33rd Street. -What the hell are they doing?
Oh, jeez.
Why that little stop?
Train has to stop at signal points.
Some kind of an override?
Yep, some kind of an override, that's right.
There we go. Okay, let's move out. Let's go, let's go.
Roosevelt tunnel, which way?
Which way?
She's moving again. Next stop, 28th Street.
Why that little stop, huh?
-I told you, the signal points. -How do you know...
-I told you, the signal points. -How do you know... -...they didn't set the throttle, jump? -We got every exit covered.
-...they didn't set the throttle, jump? -We got every exit covered. There's nowhere to go.
Listen, the throttle can't be set. It has to be held.
It's the failsafe, it's a dead-man's switch.
Doesn't have a hand pressing down on it...
...the train stops cold. Believe me, they're still aboard.
It's going faster.
Emri, off the track. Come on.
Let's go!
Garber, come on.
Come on!
It's gonna derail before it gets to Coney Island.
That's it. That's it right there. Roosevelt tunnel.
It's a fucking train crossover. Come on. Cross over now!
-What? -Come on, move!
Hey!
-Fuck it, let's go! -We gotta find him!
We don't have time! Let's go!
I love you. I fucking love you.
Geo, I fucking love you too.
Hello? Hello?
We're getting calls.
Cops on the platform are seeing passengers...
-...nobody in the motorman's booth. -Believe me, they're still aboard.
It's all right! As soon as we hit a red light...
It's all right! As soon as we hit a red light... -...the brakes will stop it automatically. -Yeah, but they're all green!
-...the brakes will stop it automatically. -Yeah, but they're all green!
Four stops away.
Two stops.
Oh, Jesus. The train just stopped.
I really gotta take that piss.
There's no hijackers onboard, just passengers.
Where was that first stop that they made?
Near 34th.
-That's by the Roosevelt spur. -The what?
A derelict tunnel built under the Waldorf Hotel.
Converge everything on that area. Throw a goddamn dragnet over it!
Hey!
Freeze!
Put your hands in the air!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey. Get out, get out, get out.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Out of the-- Get out of the way!
Just go, go, go.
-911 operator. -Hello? Hello?
-This is Walter Garber, MTA. -How do you spell that?
Don't worry about how to spell it.
Just tell Lieutenant Camonetti...
...that Ryder is headed to the Manhattan Bridge!
Cars everywhere. Nobody's going anywhere for a long time.
Hey. Hey!
-Is he in there? -No, no, no.
-No. -Where did he go? Brooklyn. He said he couldn't wait, he started walking.
Brooklyn. He said he couldn't wait, he started walking.
This fucking city!
Come on, you guys. Move out!
Ryder!
Don't move.
So is this how you thought the day was going to end, huh?
When you put your socks on this morning?
This make you feel better, Garber?
That make everything okay now?
No! But it's a start.
Don't move.
Don't move!
Hey!
Garber Baby boy, I ain't going back to prison.
I don't-- I don't think you got any-- Any options now or leverage.
Hey!
Hey!
We all owe God a death, I told you that.
You're wrong, Ryder. We owe God life.
Life. And that's the life I gave you back today.
And now you have to give me something back.
What are you talking about?
You got a gun in your hand, I want you to use it. Shoot me.
No, shoot me before they shoot me, or I'm gonna kill you.
I will shoot you. I don't want to, but I will.
-Hey! -I thought you cared. -No! -You said:
"Ryder. Ryder, don't you have anyone who cares?"
I thought that was you.
-Come on, man, pay it back. -I'm not gonna shoot you.
I'm gonna give you 10, then deal's off.
I got a gun, I'm gonna use it. I'm gonna take your life back.
-Hey! -Come on, man!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five--
You gonna take this down to zero? Come on, motherfucker, shoot me!
I am not going to shoot you!
Five, four. Come on.
-Hey! -Three.
Police, drop your weapon!
I'm disappointed in you. Two.
You're my goddamn hero.
Drop your weapon!
Mr. Garber.
-Interesting day, huh? -Yes, sir.
You know, just about every day I make a speech...
...and it starts with:
"I'd like to thank you on behalf of the city of New York," blah, blah, blah.
And I never know who I'm thanking or why.
But you...
...did a hell of a thing today.
You went to bat for the city of New York.
And on behalf of me, I'd like to thank you.
Well, you're welcome. I mean, it's been an amazing day.
Everybody's thanking me all day, but I appreciate it. You're welcome.
And I want you to know...
...that tomorrow, the city of New York is going to go to bat for you.
In a big way. You understand?
Yes, sir.
And this city has a very good batting average.
-I appreciate it. -All right.
I'm gonna get home.
Oh, take my car.
-No, no, I'll take-- -Put the siren on and everything.
-There's a siren on there? -Yes.
No, I'll take the subway. But I appreciate it.
-Really? -Yeah.
You know, me, subway all my life. I get home faster than you anyway.
Not you, but, you know, everybody else.
But thank you, sir.
You a Yankee fan?
No. Well, yes. Yes, of course.
Oh, Paul, leave me alone.
Butter.
Oh, my goodness.
You have to taste this.
Here.
I mean-- It's--
-I know. -But I'm--
I know. I know. I know.
Look at that. Oh, Paul, it's so beautiful.
Slow down.
Sorry.
This is it. Look, right-- Just stop.
I can't believe we get to live here.
Paul.
Should we have stayed in Brooklyn?
We're gonna love Queens. Queens is beautiful.
Moving truck's here.
You okay?
-Everything is falling down. -Hey.
What are we doing here?
Repeat after me.
Nine hundred square feet.
Nine hundred square feet.
-Plus, it's close to your office. -Plus, it's close to my office.
But we don't have to move. We could renege on the lease...
...repack everything and live in the Jeep.
You're right. You're right.
-Eric, what is that noise? -What noise?
Is it going to be like this every night?
Maybe.
Jule?
It's Versailles.
I'm so happy you like it, darling.
Good morning, Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.
LMDC.
Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, Julie Powell.
-My son died in the second tower. -I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Are you the person to speak to if I don't like the plan for the memorial...
-...that was in the Times? -You can speak to me.
-Do you have any power? -No.
I wanna speak to someone with power. I don't like the plan.
I don't like the plan either.
You people are a bunch of heartless bureaucratic goons.
I am not a heartless goon.
I am just a person in a cubicle, and I am doing the best I can.
This is my sixth call. The only thing anyone tells me...
...is I have to get in line for an insurance payment.
You do. If you don't wanna fill out a form, I will fill one out for you...
...but you still have to come sign it.
-To your cubicle? -Yes.
I feel terrible about what you're going through--
You have no idea what I'm going through. You have no idea.
-Please don't yell. -This thing is completely inefficient.
-Please stop yelling. -My 3-year-old is more capable.
I am your friend.
There's fiberglass in his lungs.
He coughs. He never stops coughing. I don't know what to do.
There's so much in his lungs he can't breathe.
His insurance is refusing to pay for this drug that might work.
-Tell her to call the Health Department. -That's an answering machine.
Andrea Gomez in the mayor's office.
Thank you. Thank you.
Chocolate cream pie.
-You know what I love about cooking? -What's that?
I love that after a day when nothing is sure--
And when I say "nothing," I mean nothing.
--you can come home and absolutely know...
...that if you add egg yolks to chocolate and sugar and milk...
...it will get thick.
It's such a comfort.
Bad day?
When will this pie be ready?
Soon. I have to make the whipped cream and let it set.
I'll be here. It's a masterpiece.
Ritual Cobb salad lunch tomorrow.
Dreading, dreading, dreading.
Subway.
-Hi. -Hi.
How are you?
-What can I get for you ladies? -I will have a Cobb salad, no blue cheese.
-Cobb salad, no beets. -Cobb salad, no bacon.
-Cobb salad, no eggs. -Okay, tell them....
Are you listening carefully, Tracy? Tell them to take the offer up to 185.
-Here she goes. -Repeat after me.
-One-eight-five. -What's going on?
And call me the second you hear back.
My assistant. It's almost not worth having one.
I know. I said to Allison, "Go to the pharmacy, get me a pair of pantyhose."
She said, "They didn't have any."
I said, "Did you try another pharmacy?" I mean, really.
Or Bloomingdale's. What's wrong with trying Bloomingdale's?
I don't get it. If only I could be my own assistant.
You can be.
Fire your assistant and don't hire a replacement.
No, that's not what I mean, Julie. Excuse me.
-Oh, those are cute. -Oh, thanks.
Okay, tell them 190. One-nine-oh. Great.
"One-nine-oh"? What? What are you up to?
One hundred and ninety million dollars. We're assembling a parcel at Midtown.
-That is so great, Cassie. -A parcel of what?
Buildings.
We're gonna tear them all down and put up a high-rise.
-To your parcel. -Thank you.
And enough about you, here's to me.
As of yesterday, I am the senior vice president in charge of corporate publicity.
-No. -Which means I get a raise...
...and I can borrow half a million dollars at 2 percent, if I want to.
-Great. -If you want to?
-So how's your job, Julie? -Oh, it's--
-I can only imagine. Heartbreaking. -So sad.
-Painful. -Not in a bad way.
-Excuse me. Oh, God, I forgot. -Oh, excuse me.
-Hello? -Hello?
-Hi. -Hi.
Hey, Jules? I have got to interview you for this piece that I'm writing.
Sure, Annabelle, great. I'd be honored.
Call Julie about interview.
Find out about dry cleaning. Find out before dinner on Thursday.
Saturday party.
No.
I cannot computer-coach you while I'm with my girlfriends.
What is it about? The article?
It's about our generation turning 30.
People turning 30. Oh, my life, I am so busy.
I don't know when I can fit you in.
May I remind you, I don't want to see you, you want to see me?
Yeah. Would a breakfast work?
I believed her. What kind of idiot am I?
She said, "It's about our generation turning 30."
What'd you expect? Annabelle was always a liar.
"Julie Powell, once editor of the Amherst literary magazine.
The one we all knew would be 'The One'...
...temped for eight years before giving up on her novel...
...and now works in a cubicle as a mid-level bureaucrat...
...attempting to deal with the aftereffects of 9/11."
Oh, God, you memorized it? How pathetic.
She left so much out.
Anyway, the picture was good.
-I looked fat. -Just your face.
I forgot to tell you. Do you know what Annabelle's doing now?
-Sarah told me. A blog. -Of what?
What do you mean, "of what"? A blog of Annabelle.
Of every thought that passes through her brain.
Her stupid, vapid, insipid....
I could write a blog.
I have thoughts.
And you're a writer. More than I can say for Annabelle.
-If only that were true. -You wrote a novel.
Half a novel. And no one wanted to publish it.
You're not a writer unless someone publishes you.
See, that's what's so great about blogs. You don't have to be published.
You can just go online, press enter and there it is, out there.
What would I write a blog about?
You're an editor, tell me.
Why don't you write about how much you love Queens?
A short blog.
You could...write about your job.
If I wrote about my job and anyone at work read it....
-I mean, hello. -This is good.
This is really good.
On top of which, the idea of a blog is to get away from what I do all day.
The way that cooking is a way I get away from what I do all day.
So write a blog about cooking.
I'm not a real cook, like Julia Child or Mario Batali.
Julia Child wasn't always Julia Child.
If I really wanted to learn to cook...
...I could just cook my way through Julia Child's cookbook.
I could blog about that.
I have a copy. I stole it from my mother last time I was in Texas.
When I was eight, my father's boss came to dinner and it was a really big deal...
...and my mother made boeuf bourguignon.
But it wasn't just boeuf bourguignon. It was Julia's boeuf bourguignon.
And it was like she was there, like Julia was there in the room...
...on our side like some great, big, good fairy.
And everything was going to be all right.
I'm gonna try to flip this thing over now...
...which is a rather daring thing to do.
She changed everything.
Before her, it was frozen food and can openers and marshmallows.
Don't knock marshmallows.
When you flip anything...
...you've just got to have the courage of your convictions.
Especially if it's a loose sort of mass like--
That didn't go very well.
You see, when I flipped it...
-...I didn't have the courage I needed... -She's so adorable.
...the way I should've.
But you can always put it together.
And you're alone in the kitchen. Who's to see?
Pearls. The woman is wearing pearls in the kitchen.
You've just got to practice, like the piano.
I'm Julia Child.
Julia Child is coauthor of the book Mastering the Art of French Cooking.
"For the servantless American cook." That's me, all right.
Okay, here's a problem. I've never eaten an egg.
And I have a hyperacidic stomach. We'll deal.
So I'll cook my way through the Julia Child cookbook...
...and write a blog about it.
-But I'll probably need a deadline. -Why?
Otherwise it'll be like everything else I do. I never finish anything.
-Hey. -Well, it's true.
You know why I think it is?
-ADD. -You have ADD?
Yes. That's why I'm so bad at housework.
Oh, is that it?
-A deadline would be good. -So a deadline. "I love deadlines.
I love the sound they make as they go whooshing past."
-Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. -I mean it.
-Okay, so a year or so. -A year?
This thing weighs like two pounds.
I have a full-time job. Sometimes I don't get home until 8 or 9:00 and....
It's crazy. It's crazy.
-Is it crazy? -Yes. Yes.
-Okay, you want to do Blog Z? -Yes.
Blog Z it is.
"Nobody here...
...but us servantless American cooks."
"Servantless American cooks."
-What do you think? -Love it.
"Start blogging."
"The Julie-slash-Julia Project.
The Book: Mastering the Art of French Cooking.
First edition, 1961, by Simone Beck, Louisette Bertholle...
...and, of course, Julia Child, the woman who taught America to cook, and to eat.
It's 40 years later and no one can touch her.
The challenge: 365 days, 524 recipes.
The contender: Julie Powell.
Government employee by day, renegade foodie by night.
Risking her marriage, her job and her cat's well-being...
...she has signed on for a deranged assignment.
How far it will go: no one can say."
Dear Charlie, we're settled in finally, and Julia loves it here.
She wants to stay forever.
You know how famously grouchy the French can be, dear brother.
Everyone here is so delightful.
But Julia brings out the best in a polecat.
So charming.
So she thinks they're the most wonderful people in the world.
I feel that I am French.
I just must be.
Well, you might be.
As for staying here forever, I have to say, I wouldn't mind it myself.
-I'm so glad you came. -It was a very nice show.
-Thanks for coming. -I enjoyed it.
-Paul, congratulations. Excellent exhibit. -Thanks so much, Jack.
Jack Donovan, this is my wife, Julia.
-It was such a wonderful exhibition, Paul. -Thank you. Thank you.
-I am so proud of you. -Oh, good.
French people eat French food.
-Every single day. I can't get over it. -They do.
You know, I love you so much, I'm gonna let you take the first bite.
-That's so good. -Before I even-- Is it good?
What should I do, do you think?
About what?
I don't really want to go back into government work.
You know, but I.... Shouldn't I find something to do?
These wives don't do anything here.
-That's not me. It's just not me. -I know.
I saw a notice on the bulletin board at the embassy...
...for hat-making lessons.
You like hats.
I do, I do.
I do.
What is it that you really like to do?
Eat.
-It's what I like to do. -I know, I know. I know. I know.
-And you are so good at it. Look at you. -I am.
-How good you are. -I'm growing in front of you.
I was thinking of taking bridge lessons.
-You like bridge. -I do. I like the idea of bridge.
Four points for an ace, three points for a king...
...two points for a queen, one point for a jack.
And breast your cards.
Do you have any French cookbooks in English?
-I'm afraid not. -Oh, gosh.
The salesperson. She--
--had no idea, because, you see, there is no French cookbook in English.
And all I have is this Joy of Cooking by Irma Rombauer...
...which is an excellent, excellent cookbook, but it's not French.
So I did ask my friend Avis De Voto...
...to look in the United States to see if she could find...
Right. Right.
Gosh, I thought I was speaking French to you.
Oh, my goodness.
What do we have here?
-It's a copy of.... -It's my memoirs.
Oh, look.
Oh, it's fantastic. But it's in French.
-You'll get there. -Thank you, darling.
I know. I'm learning. I'm trying. I'm really--
Oh, happy birthday to me.
-Happy birthday. -Happy birthday.
-What can this mean? -What?
-"Wash the thighs." -No, "bathe." Bathe the thighs.
-Look, but then.... -Where?
"In butter." I know that. But what is the--?
"Bathe the thighs in butter and then stuff the--"
What's that word?
-The hen. -Right. Hen.
"--until she just can't take it anymore."
-It doesn't say that. -It does.
I'll show you later in the dictionary. I'll go through the whole recipe with you.
-Why don't I go to cooking school? -Why don't you?
-I'm serious. -So am I.
What if you hadn't fallen in love with me?
But I did.
Oh, gosh.
Yesterday was Tuesday, August 13th, 2002.
Day one, 364 days to go.
I cooked artichokes with hollandaise sauce...
...which is melted butter whipped into a frenzy with egg yolks...
...until it's died and gone to heaven.
And let me say this: Is there anything better than butter? Think it over.
Every time you taste something that's delicious beyond imagining...
...and you say, "What is in this?"
The answer is always going to be "butter."
It's incredible.
It's been whisked into submission.
The day there's a meteor heading to earth and we have 30 days to live...
...I am going to spend it eating butter.
Here's my final word on the subject:
You can never have too much butter.
August 24th, day 11.
Is this what you mean when you say "don't crowd the mushrooms"?
Three hundred and fifty-three days to go. A horrible day at work.
A grandma who looked as if she wouldn't harm a fly...
...called me a pencil-pushing capitalist dupe.
Then I came home and cooked chicken with cream, mushrooms and port...
...and it was total bliss.
Here's the big news.
I had been cooking mushrooms the wrong way my entire life.
Don't crowd the mushrooms, otherwise they won't brown.
Are you listening, whoever you are?
-You're gonna love that one. -Day 22.
This one's really good with fig jam.
I got carried away in Dean & DeLuca and spent half my take-home pay.
The thing I realized when I got to the subway with my groceries...
...a bag of cat litter, a bottle of olive oil I could not live without...
...and a huge bunch of branches...
...was that the branches were probably not a good idea.
Sorry.
They were slapping folks in the face and I was sweating like a pig...
...since I've been way too busy cooking fattening food to bother exercising.
And then I came home and got a big vote of confidence from my mother.
Remind me again why you're doing this...?
-Blog. -Whatever it's called.
It's a regimen, Mom. Like doing sit-ups.
-Well, it's just adding pressure. -What pressure?
You have a full-time job, you have a husband...
...and now you're gonna get sick from blogging.
-It's sort of like being in AA. -What are you saying?
It gives you something you have to do one day at a time.
How do you know this lingo?
Honey, are you an alcoholic?
I'm saying it's good for me to have short-term goals.
Well, that is silly. That is just plain silly.
Who's reading this blog?
People. People are reading it, I'm sure.
It's something you decided to do, and you can decide not to.
-Not one single person's gonna mind. -No. Don't you get it? I just started.
I can't stop, I have to finish. It's all I've got.
Hello? Hello?
Stupid dead phone.
Hey, it's not all you got.
I know. I know. I didn't mean that.
Yesterday, I poached an egg. It seemed like the perfect thing to do...
...on perhaps the second-worst workday in recorded history.
Explain how you've never eaten an egg in your life.
I've had eggs in, like, cakes.
Never had an "egg" egg. I was a very willful child.
It's simmering.
I had this notion, God knows why, that poaching eggs would be simple.
But I was deeply wrong.
"Push the white over the yolk with a wooden spoon for two to three seconds."
Immediately.
-Disgusting. -Oh, maybe the eggs aren't fresh.
-Julia says the eggs have to be fresh. -They are fresh.
Okay. You don't have to bite my head off. I'm just quoting Julia.
It took three of us crammed into the kitchen over a pot of water...
...but eventually, we nailed it.
-Hello. -Welcome.
How cute is that?
And I ate my very first egg of my whole life, ever, ever, ever.
I thought eggs were going to be greasy and slimy, but it tastes like...
...cheese sauce. Yum.
Julia Child, you are so good.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
And, may I say, excellent wine?
-Do you think Julia knows about you? -I wish.
I have this fantasy that she comes and I show her my new lemon zester.
We become very close.
The truth is, no one knows about me.
I feel like I'm just sending things into this giant void.
Which reminds me. Annabelle's blog. Have you read it lately?
Yes.
-It's sort of funny. -Is it?
She's dating this rich guy who owns a plane. His name's Lester.
And they do it in the air. People love it. It's a huge hit.
What do you think it means if you don't like your friends?
-It's completely normal. -Men like their friends.
We're not talking about men. Who's talking about men?
So it's five weeks down, 47 to go, and I feel fantastic.
Sometimes, I can't help but wonder, is there anyone out there reading me?
But I'm sure you are, aren't you? Somebody?
Anybody?
Ernestine, I have a comment.
My mother. Doesn't count.
Today we will begin by learning to boil eggs.
First, you must make sure that the egg is fresh.
I was so hoping that....
Well, for something a little more advanced, Madame Brassart.
But you are not an advanced cook.
But I do know how to boil an egg.
Do you know how to bone a duck?
No, but that's exactly the sort of thing...
...that I'm very interested in learning how to do.
There is one other class, but you will not like it.
It's for professionnel, which you will never be, I'm sure.
All men. All GIs.
And very expensive.
I cannot imagine that you would ever want to pay the tuition.
How much?
So the onion is ready, but....
You must hold the knife, first of all, like this.
Wrist, easy. Leave the thumb here.
The hand and the knife are one.
And the hand, the other hand, you must protect it.
You must cut only the onion. Yes?
-Not me. -Yes.
And then, you put your thumb here and the other fingers here.
Jule? You're being a little over-competitive, don't you think?
Well, you should've seen the way those men looked at me.
As if I were some frivolous housewife, just looking for a way to kill time.
Well....
-Where are you going? -Not here.
-You hungry? -No.
Good.
Well done, Madame Child.
Dear Avis, I'm in my third week at Le Cordon Bleu...
...and I'm in utter bliss.
Every morning the alarm goes off at 6:30, and I leap out of bed.
I'm up.
By 7:30 I'm in class, in my apron, peeling potatoes.
Then we cook stock and we bone fish.
We dress pigeons. We make pastry with so much butter...
...it almost stops your heart just to look at it.
My teacher moves so quickly I'm sometimes lost.
But I'm way ahead of the others in the class, all of them men...
...and all of them very unfriendly, until they discovered I was fearless.
Something I realized about the same time they did.
Morning class ends at 12:30, then I go home and make lunch for Paul.
Then Paul takes a nap.
And later in the afternoon, he goes back to the embassy and I go back to school.
You must have a mortar and pestle.
Incidentally, my father is horrified I'm going to cooking school.
Offered to give me extra money to hire a cook.
Go on. Fun. Joy. This is what matters.
I'm probably the only American I know in Paris...
...who thinks shopping for food is as much fun as buying a dress.
You'd think so too if you lived in a country...
...where absolutely nothing comes in my size.
By the way, did you know that if you don't dry meat...
...it won't brown properly?
Irma Rombauer doesn't say a word about it in the Joy of Cooking.
Avis, I am in heaven here.
I've been looking for a career all my life...
-Happy Valentine's Day. -...and I've found it.
We met in Ceylon when we were in the OSS.
But he never noticed me at first.
That's not true. I noticed your legs straightaway.
Oh, you were such a roué.
-All the women were mad for him. -Can you blame them?
Anyway, we were sent off to China.
Absolutely delicious, if I do say so myself.
Julia. When you finish your term, you'll be teaching at Cordon Bleu.
No, I don't think so.
The woman who runs it absolutely hates me.
Oh, no one could possibly hate you.
-That's true. But she does. -Were you spies?
No. Yes. No.
Oh, so cagey, right?
You were in the Office of Strategic Services and you were not spies?
I was only a file clerk.
But Paul? Paul designed all of the secret war rooms for General Mountbatten.
-Well, just maps and exhibits. It wasn't-- -He did.
He single-handedly won the war for us.
Well, I had to. Someone did. I mean, it was dragging on, wasn't it?
Anyway, so there we were in China, just friends having dinner...
...and it turned out to be Julia.
It turned out to be Julia all along.
Julia, you are the butter to my bread, and the breath to my life.
I love you, darling girl.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Dear Charlie...
...Julia in front of her stove has the same fascination for me...
...as watching a kettle drummer at the symphony.
The oven door opens and shuts so fast...
...you hardly notice the deft thrust of a spoon as she dips into a casserole...
...and up to her mouth for a taste check...
...like a perfectly-timed double beat on the drums.
Then with her bare fingers...
...she snatches a set of cannelloni out of the pot of boiling water...
...and she cries:
"These damn things are as hot as a stiff cock."
-She said what? -I know.
-Julia Child said "hot as a"...? -I know, I'm shocked.
It's from a letter that Paul Child wrote to his twin brother Charlie in 1949...
...when Julia was starting classes at Le Cordon Bleu.
So Julia and Paul, beaucoup, beaucoup.
-I know. Just goes to show you. -What?
You can never tell about a person's sex life.
They were so in love.
Hot sauce from a reader.
And today I had 12 comments from readers, and I didn't know any of them.
Thanks to all my faithful readers for this loot.
I have now completed 65 recipes in 47 days.
Fifty-nine days down, 437 recipes to go.
On track with 103 recipes in just over two months.
-Looks like a cupcake. -Lobster thermidor is coming up...
...and I am going to have to murder and dismember a crustacean.
How will I ever do this?
Last night our sleep machine, the one we have...
...to drown out the noise of trucks rumbling past our apartment...
...was speaking to me, and it was saying:
"Lobster killer.
Lobster killer, lobster killer, lobster killer."
One reader said if you put lobsters in the freezer...
...it sort of numbs them.
Another comment said, "Man up, kill the damn lobster.
Just take a knife and do it."
It's alive.
Eric.
Oh, God.
"A note on dealing with live lobsters.
If you object to steaming a live lobster--" Yes.
"--plunge the point of the knife into the head between the eyes."
Oh, Julia, you make it sound so simple.
Lobster killer.
Eric.
Eric.
Get out of here.
I don't need you at all. You are completely useless.
I'm just gonna throw them into the water...
...and put the lid on and that will be that.
-Fine. -Fine.
Hello.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You okay?
Okay.
Okay. All right.
All right, boys.
There's a new sheriff in town.
Lobster killer.
Lobster killer.
Under control.
You are a saint.
Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
-I can't. -You can.
-No, I can't. I have a lot to do. -You can.
-Eric, I can't. -Just give me one more, one more.
Fine. Go, I have so much to do. Get.
Out.
-Thank you so much. -How you doing?
-You all right? -Yeah, terrific. Good to see you.
-Cake. -Cake. Brother-in-law.
-Love you so much. -Hey, man.
Hi, hi, hi.
Happy birthday, Julie.
-Happy birthday. -Hi. Thanks, sweetheart.
Thanks for coming all out here. Hey, you.
When Julia and Paul met, she was a virgin.
Really?
-She was, like, practically 40. -You serious?
How does anyone know that?
Letters that Julia wrote to her friend Avis De Voto.
And Paul wrote to his brother, and no one threw anything out.
When they got married, she could barely boil an egg.
-Isn't that amazing? -Really?
-Braised cucumbers are a revelation. -This is good.
I'm obsessed with her. I'm totally obsessed.
She's totally obsessed.
It's good that you are, because this is amazing.
Seriously. So good.
Savor it, because that's all there is. I mean, lobster, major bucks.
Why don't you put a PayPal thing on the website?
People could send money if they like.
Oh, yeah. Absolutely. You have fans, your readers love you.
I do? I have fans?
Yeah, you do.
-Well, I can't ask them for money. -Why not?
I think you should do the PayPal thing. That way we could have more lobster.
-Harder. Get them. Hey, hey, hey. -Thirty. Thirty. Thirty.
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
Thank you.
Just like Julia's.
Only hers were probably the real deal.
They're beautiful.
Help you put it on.
Let's give this a shot here.
How's that?
Yeah.
I'm 30.
I thought it was gonna be terrible...
...but thanks to you, and thanks to Julia...
...it feels like I'm gonna get through.
Cake.
More cake. How do you like that cake?
Hey, you.
I'm going to bed.
Ernie, 53 comments on my lobster blog.
Shut up.
Julie Powell.
This the person I speak to if I got a problem?
-Yes, sir. What is your problem? -Too much food, not enough sex.
Eric, that's not funny.
I thought it was pretty funny.
Okay, it was.
-Hey, guess what? -What?
You are the third most popular blog on salon.com.
-I am? -Yes, you are.
I am!
So I figure for every one who writes in...
...there are, I don't know, hundreds that don't. Don't you think?
It's like there's this whole group of people who are sort of connected to me.
They need me in some way.
Like, if I didn't write, they would really be upset.
They'd probably take, like, poison, try to kill themselves.
Julia.
Are you still making hats?
Oh, no, I abandoned it.
But I am ready to graduate from the Cordon Bleu.
I can't get the damn woman who runs the school to schedule the test.
Madame Brassart? Is that the woman you are speaking of?
She is a bitch.
She is, you're right.
I think she's almost the only person in the world I honestly can't stand.
She is not the only person I can't stand.
Do you two know each other?
You should. Julia Child, Simone Beck.
-Simca. -Simca, how do you do?
And this is my friend Louisette Bertholle.
I can't believe you haven't met.
Simca and Louisette are writing a cookbook.
-For Americans. -Really?
Why do you need to take a stupid test?
So I can get a diploma. So I can teach.
You don't need a diploma to teach.
You're probably right.
-Avis says the same thing. -Who is Avis?
My friend, Avis De Voto, lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
She's very wise.
But I can't help it. I want a diploma.
I am very conventional.
I don't know what to do.
Well, why don't you write to the horrible Madame Brassart...
...and threaten her?
Threaten her? With what?
The United States of America.
Yes.
Tell her the American ambassador personally wants you...
...to take the examination.
Oh, no, no, no.
I couldn't do that. Heavens, no.
The American ambassador. Hardly even know the man.
Of course you can.
Dear Madame Brassart...
...everyone at the American embassy...
...including my dear friend the ambassador...
...will be very surprised if I'm not allowed to take my examination.
You will write the recipes...
...for oeufs mollets, côtelettes de veau en surprise...
...et crème renversée au caramel.
I had no idea what veal en surprise was. None.
Cooked it in class. It's a veal chop with mushrooms in a bag.
A paper bag. That's the surprise.
You open the bag, surprise.
Veal and mushrooms, it's just... I've never flunked a test in my entire life.
-I am an A student. -You can ask to take it again.
-I can? -Of course.
Meanwhile, you can come teach with us.
Gosh.
Is it true you plan to teach?
Yes, we're going to teach Americans in Paris how to cook.
Madame Child, I must tell you, you have no real talent for cooking.
But the Americans will never know the difference.
We are, I am sorry to say, entering aspics.
An aspic is sort of a beef-flavored Jell-O mold.
Doesn't that sound delicious?
I can't imagine why no one makes them anymore.
You begin with a calf's foot...
...which I am in possession of thanks to my sainted husband...
...and you boil it until your kitchen smells like a tannery.
And then it gels in the refrigerator and you flip it onto a plate.
Which, according to Julia Child, is supposed to be easy.
And all I can say about that, no offense intended, Julia, is...
...the bitch lied.
Shit.
-Shit. -How many more aspics are there?
Seven.
No one will know if you don't do them.
It's not like there's, like, the Aspic Police or something.
-You could lie. -I can't. I just can't.
Julia will know. It's like she's watching me. I'm under her influence.
I'm becoming a much better person because of her.
Yuck. The sink. Look at this.
I hate it here. Did you put something down the sink?
You hate it here?
How am I supposed to cook anything in this kitchen?
It's no wonder that my mold fell apart. I don't suppose we have any Drano.
Not unless you bought it.
I do all of this and I'm supposed to buy Drano too?
Right now, you are so not under the influence of Julia Child.
What if I don't make my deadline, Eric? I'll have wasted a whole year of my life.
I used to be thin and now I'm getting fat.
-Fat? -On top of which...
-...I have to bone a whole duck. -When?
At some point.
-Can you conceive of boning a duck? -No, I can't.
Of course you can't.
I'm sure you all remember, because it was only a few days ago...
...that I had a meltdown over my aspic...
...and vowed to transform myself into a better human being.
And then I was trussing the poulet rôti à la normande...
...which is roast chicken stuffed with chicken livers and cream cheese...
...and it fell on the floor and the stuffing fell out into a big gooey mess.
-What am I doing? -So, long story short, another meltdown.
This is crazy.
Worse than the last.
I can't even truss.
And I cried like a small, emotionally disturbed child.
I'm a mess.
I got it. I got it.
Hello?
Yeah, who's this?
Can you hold on just one second?
I'm not sure if she's here. She might've stepped out. Hold on.
Hey, it's a reporter from The Christian Science Monitor.
He wants to write about you.
He does?
I should tell him to call back, right?
No, no, I'll take it.
Hello?
Yes?
You want to bring who to dinner?
No, of course I know who that is. I know exactly who that is.
Who? Who, who, who?
That would be great. That would be completely amazing.
Goodbye.
-Who? -Guess who's coming to dinner.
Oh, my God.
To Les Trois Gourmandes.
One for all and all for one.
Yes.
All right. I had such a horrible time...
...converting these recipes from the metric system.
-Measurements do not matter. -Oh, but they do.
They absolutely do.
This is one of the biggest arguments we had when we worked on our cookbook.
Which is finally finished.
Sent off to the publisher. Soon Simca and I will be famous.
We'll be the next Mrs. Joy of Cooking.
Maybe. All right. Well, let's try. Let's just give it a....
Can I help?
Yeah, it is mieux.
So, yes. They're early. Americans.
Dear Dorothy, your sister Julia is now a cooking teacher.
We have three students who pay $2 a class.
Barely enough to cover the cost of the food, but who cares?
Simca, Louisette, and I are Les Trois Gourmandes.
Although sometimes we are only Les Deux Gourmandes...
...because Louisette turns out to have headaches...
...and doctor's appointments she schedules during class.
I have a little headache.
You'll meet them both when you come here next month...
...unless, of course, Louisette is having a stomachache.
Perfection. And even if it isn't, never apologize.
No excuses. No explanations.
Louisette abandoned us, another stomachache.
And the day before that...
...she left class before we even finished making the chocolate Bavarian cream.
I can't believe that's the only time her dentist could see her.
Keep an eye out, we don't want to miss Dorothy.
It's impossible to miss your sister.
I don't see her.
-There she is. -Dorothy!
Hi, Julia. I missed you.
-So good to see-- Paul. -Hi. Hi, sweetie.
I've had an adventure on the ocean liner.
-I didn't get sick once. -Good girl. How about your legs?
People were dropping like flies all around me.
-Look. -Oh, my goodness.
Look at that.
All I think about all day is food, and then I dream about it all night.
It is true, she's obsessed.
If I didn't sit in the kitchen, I'd never see her.
Last week, I dreamed that I made cassoulet for Dad...
...and he hated it, of course.
He doesn't understand any of this.
I almost feel sorry for him.
He wanted so much for us to stay in Pasadena...
...marry Republicans, and breed like rabbits.
-Why didn't we? -Too tall.
Let's face it, it's true.
From the beginning, you just don't fit in. Literally.
-So then you don't. -I know, it's true.
Do not bait Father about politics when he comes.
-No. -Or he won't pick up the check.
-He won't, will he? -I can't make any promises.
-He loves Senator McCarthy. -Oh, I know.
-Pasadena. -Pasadena.
Jinx.
Dort, do you have--? You have the Brie.
-Is this the Brie? -That's the Brie.
Is that not the most wonderful cheese you ever had?
-Yes. -Yes.
The answer's yes.
I got the chef at Chez la Mère Michel to give me the recipe for beurre blanc.
What's beurre blanc?
-Butter in a white wine vinegar reduction. -Oh, I love butter.
You whisk them together...
...and the acid in the vinegar works on the milk solids in the butter...
...so that the butter, instead of melting, becomes this creamy, light, frothy....
With kind of a fantastic subtle kind of....
Tangy.
It has a tanginess.
Tanginess?
Yes.
Well, that's....
That's who I married.
Anyway...
...you serve it on fish and it's splendid. I'm going to make it for you.
-That'll be divine. -Yeah.
And, Dort, we're going to throw you a party.
-Really? -Very exciting.
By the way, there's a man that I want to introduce you to.
I think you'll really....
He's....
Tall. He's very tall.
-Pardon? -Tall. He's very.
-Extremely tall. -I'm extremely tall.
-I know. -But he's even taller, so that's good.
-He is taller. -Well, that's good.
All right.
Pretty good.
But not great.
Hello, ladies. Anybody want anything?
Yes.
Help yourself. The tapenade is marvelous.
Julia, there you are.
Oh, John.
There you are.
Now, where is this sister of yours?
She's right over there. Hi, John.
-Hi, Paul. -There.
So we've told her a lot about you.
Well, I don't want to interrupt her conversation.
With Ivan Cousins? They just met.
I can't imagine Dorothy running off with Ivan Cousins.
Dearly beloved....
John, this is lovely.
I've never been to a wedding like this before.
Here, Julia.
-What a beautiful wedding. -Thanks, Pops.
I am not enthusiastic about this marriage.
Well, you weren't very enthusiastic about ours, either.
True.
How are things at the embassy, Paul?
Oh, fine. Thank you, Phila. Thank you.
Well, not fine, really, because they've cut our library allowance by 90 percent.
It seems that Senator McCarthy has very long arms.
Senator McCarthy is a man who knows his mind.
I admire a man who knows his mind.
Well, we know lots of people in Washington who have lost their jobs...
...after years in government service, for no reason whatsoever.
And Paul had to make a list of every single book in the embassy library.
Surely you're not suggesting that the French government is any better.
-And-- -Shall we dance?
Come on, dance with me.
Excuse us.
You said you didn't wanna talk about it, then you talked about it.
I know, I never learn.
Where's my big sprig?
Up here, whipping away.
And for dinner, mayonnaise?
-That's good. -That is good, isn't it?
-Very. From your sister. -I'm going to send this recipe to Avis.
I'm very excited about it.
-I think it's a breakthrough. -Well, it tastes like it.
Dorothy is pregnant.
Paul, isn't--?
Isn't that wonderful?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
-I'm so happy. -I know.
I know.
If you warm the bowl slightly before you beat in the egg yolk...
...it changes everything.
Foolproof mayonnaise. Absolutely foolproof.
I typed it up.
-You disagree? -About the mayonnaise? Not at all.
I'm sure you're exactly right.
Scientific workability. That's my motto.
Julia.
We have a little problem.
-Our editor... -For our cookbook.
...thinks our book is not in English.
But your book is in English.
They are giving it a rejection.
But they suggest that if we are continuing with it...
...we should get a collaborator who could take what we have...
...and make it work for American cooks.
Would you do it, Julia?
Would I do it?
Yes.
We are now going to play a round of "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner."
This Wednesday, I am going to be playing host to a distinguished guest.
Clue number one:
The degree of separation between Julia Child and me...
...is about to shrink by a factor of about a thousand.
A thousand.
In answer to your questions, it is not Amanda Hesser of The New York Times...
...or Nigella Lawson, or Ina Garten.
But here's clue number two:
I will be making boeuf bourguignon...
...which was the first dish our distinguished guest cooked...
...upon reading Mastering the Art of French Cooking for the first time.
Boeuf bourguignon, Julia Child's boeuf bourguignon.
Well, since no one guessed my mystery guest, I'm going to have to tell you all.
It's Judith Jones, the editor who's responsible...
...for getting Julia's cookbook published way back when.
The woman who recognized history in an onionskin manuscript.
She's older and probably not used to eating at 10:00 at night...
...which is why I'm being diligent and making the stew the night before.
And as I cook it, I almost feel as if Julia and I are communicating...
...over space and time on a deep, spiritual, mystical level.
Although, mostly, I'm just talking to myself.
-How long does it take to cook? -Two and a half hours.
Welcome.
I'm Julia Child.
And today we're going to make a holiday feast, or les fêtes d'holiday.
And we're going to start with half-boned chicken or poularde demi-désossée.
Now, first, remove the liver and fry it up with some onions for a little snack...
...or perhaps a delicious liverwurst which you can spread on a cracker...
...a Ritz cracker, a saltine.
Saltine.
Or if you have a pet, a cat or a dog, they love liver.
Save the liver.
-Save the liver. -Save the liver.
Place the chicken on its stomach and cut along the backbone...
...to the pope's nose, like so.
Crack.
Now I've done it, I've cut the dickens out of my finger.
Well, I'm glad, in a way, this happened.
You know, accidents do occur from time to time in the kitchen.
We've never really discussed what to do.
First, you must stop the bleeding.
The best way is with direct pressure on the apron, like so.
You want to raise your hand over your head.
I recommend natural coagulants, such as chicken liver.
Another reason not to throw away the liver.
Oh, God, it's throbbing. A tourniquet, that's it.
Why are you all spinning?
Well, I think I'm going to go to sleep now.
No, no, no.
Well, it's just a big, dry collection of recipes.
It doesn't work at all.
I'm just gonna have to throw most of it out and start all over again.
This has got to be a cookbook...
...that makes French cooking accessible to Americans who do not have cooks.
Who are servantless.
Is that a word?
Servantless.
I think it is a word.
Julia?
-What if we had to leave Paris? -Why would we have to leave Paris?
Because my assignment was for four years.
So then we still have time.
Eight months.
And this cookbook is not something you can finish in eight months.
No, but two years seems possible.
Julia.
What if they transfer me someplace else?
Would they do that?
Yes.
They don't really care about me.
Oh, Paul. Of course they do.
They don't, really.
Well, if we can't stay in Paris...
...then I'll just mail the pages to Louisette and Simca...
...and they can mail them back.
That's why they invented the mail system and carbon paper and onionskin copies.
Or I can just jump on the train to Paris...
...whenever the three of us absolutely have to work together, you know.
Or the two of us, actually, because as we know, Louisette does next to nothing.
But we would still be somewhere in Europe.
Don't you think?
It's very hard to say, given the current political climate.
Senator McCarthy does not like people like us.
Us? Why? What have we done?
We haven't done anything. That's not the point.
The point is, we were in China. And that's practically sufficient.
Well, meanwhile, we're still here.
-Yes, we are. You're right. -Yes.
Here's to the book.
French Cooking For All.
Or French Home Cooking. Do you like that? Which one do you like?
I like them both.
Dear Avis, enclosed is part of our cookbook from the chapter on sauces.
Naturally, it must not be shown to anyone...
...unless you are sure they are not, never have been...
...and won't have anything to do with the publishing business.
There are people who would love nothing more...
...than to steal this hollandaise recipe.
We're late. Do you suppose she'll be there?
Louisette? Of course she'll be there. It's at her house.
I was making a little joke.
-What's this about, anyway? -Louisette wouldn't tell me.
She said it was a surprise.
Maybe she's dropping out of the project. That would be heavenly.
-Julia. -Well, it would.
My friends, this is Irma Rombauer.
Mrs. Joy?
The first edition of the Joy of Cooking took me a year to write.
Only a year? Including testing the recipes?
Well, I didn't really test all the recipes. There were so many of them.
And then I found a publisher, a small printer in St. Louis.
How much money did he pay you?
I paid him, $3000.
-Three thousand dollars? -A small fortune.
But I had a little life insurance money because my husband....
-No. -He killed himself?
Yes. And I thought, "Well, what else am I gonna do with the insurance money?"
And then, the book began to sell...
...and Bobbs-Merrill picked it up, so now I had a real publisher.
And they gave you some money?
Absolutely not.
They swindled me. They stole my copyright...
...and now there's a new edition, and guess what?
-What? -The index is a complete calamity.
If you're looking for City Chicken, you're not gonna find it under "C."
Really?
It's under "Drumsticks, Mock."
No.
All she wanted to talk about...
...was how her publisher had cheated her out of thousands of dollars in royalties.
It just made me realize this....
Not going to be simple, this "getting published" business.
This is from Avis, for you.
Oh, my. Well.
What does she say now?
Avis loves my sauce chapter.
-Oh, that's wonderful, darling. -She....
Oh, no.
She showed it to someone, which I specifically asked her not to do.
She showed it to an editor at Houghton Mifflin in Boston...
...and the Boston editor showed it to the head of publishing and....
Paul. Paul.
-Paul, Paul, Paul. -Yes? What, what, what? What, what?
They want to....
They want to publish our book.
Oh, that's great news.
And they want to give us an advance.
How much?
-Two hundred and fifty dollars. -No.
And when the book is finished, $500 more.
I'm so proud of you.
The editor loves the book.
She just loves it.
"So with the smell of burned stew still in the air...
...I woke up dying of stomach cramps.
I called in sick."
And went back to bed for several hours.
Put it in the blog in case someone in your office reads it.
And went back to bed for several hours.
By noon, I was somehow able to straighten myself to a standing position.
What are you making?
Bought the ingredients for boeuf bourguignon all over again...
...dragged myself home....
...and made another boeuf bourguignon.
And for dessert, a raspberry Bavarian cream.
By the end of the day, I felt fine.
I was cooking dinner for a legend.
Even though I'd never heard of her until a few months ago.
Maybe she'll offer you a book contract.
What if she does?
I mean, what would that mean? That would mean I might be a writer.
How much money do people make for books?
Like an advance? I have no idea.
-Hundred thousand dollars? -Don't even say it.
Hello?
Hi.
I know. I know, I know. It is here too. Cats and dogs.
I know.
I know.
I know. Well, thanks.
Bye.
So not coming.
That was the guy from The Christian Science Monitor.
It's raining.
And we live in Long Island City and she's, like, older.
It's mortifying.
But on the bright side, more stew for us.
Just for once, could you not look on the bright side?
Yeah. Well, it's not the end of the world.
I thought, I really did think, I just did. I thought "book contract."
Me, Judith Jones, happily ever after.
And then we'd have a little money...
...and wouldn't live over a pizzeria for the rest of our lives.
How am I gonna explain this?
My readers are gonna be really upset. They were so into it.
-Your readers are gonna be really upset. -I never should've told everyone.
They'll live.
Somehow...
...your readers will live.
-Is it bland? -Not anymore.
Thank you for telling me.
You almost let me feed Judith Jones bland boeuf bourguignon.
This is a nightmare. I told everyone she was coming.
They will survive. When this year's over-- And I cannot wait until it is.
--your readers will somehow get on with their lives.
-And I won't, is that what you're saying? -I don't know. What's gonna happen...
...when you're no longer the center of the universe?
Oh, that's just great.
I am finally totally engaged in something.
-Maybe I'm being a little narcissistic. -A little? On a scale of 10?
Okay, a 9.3. But what do you think a blog is? It's me, me, me.
I thought it'd be fun. How stupid.
It's just a lot of "meltdowns," but they feel like I'm living with...
...a totally self-absorbed person who writes this stuff for complete strangers.
It's supposed to be a big adventure, but it's not.
It's our life. It's our marriage.
And it doesn't feel like an adventure, it feels like shit.
-It was your idea. -I know, I'm so sorry.
What the hell was I thinking? I'll tell you something else.
I am not a saint.
-Oh, yes, you are. -No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are. -No, I'm not.
And it makes me feel like an asshole every time you say it.
And do not write about this in your blog.
-About what? -About this fight.
I'm out of here.
-You all right, Julia? -Yes, fine.
I'm just perfectly fine.
Dear Avis, we finished packing today...
...and tomorrow we leave beloved Paris for Marseilles.
Paul has been appointed Cultural Affairs Commissioner for the South of France.
I'm having a hard time pretending to be anything but devastated.
I'm going to go buy some bread.
The advantage of Marseilles is that it won't have the distractions of Paris.
So we'll be able to finish the book.
Although not on deadline.
At least we're still in France.
Dear Avis, I don't know what we've done to deserve it...
...but here we are in Germany.
Actually in a suburb of Bonn called Plittersdorf on the Rhine...
...which sounds much more picturesque than it is.
By the way, there is no chance we'll meet our new deadline.
We'll be at least two more years.
Meanwhile, Paul has been called to Washington.
We have no idea why.
Well, they're going to promote you, finally.
They have to.
Well, I don't know why they have to call me back to Washington to tell me that.
They could just send a telex. It'd be a lot cheaper.
Well, they're going to reassign you then.
They'll ask you whether you prefer Paris or Paris.
It's a possibility. It's not likely, but it is a possibility.
And if they are moving us back to Paris...
...I can look for an apartment when I'm there next week.
Good idea, yes?
I promise I'll call you the minute they tell me...
...we're being transferred back to Paris, all right?
All right.
-I know, darling. -It could happen.
It could happen. Stay right there. That's perfect.
Say cheese, ducky.
-Good. -Put your legs together, darling.
It's very simple.
We're just going to tell her she should have a smaller share of the royalties...
...because it is clear she can't put in the 40 hours a week...
...you and I are spending on it.
-Sixty is more like it. Eighty. -Exactly.
-You and I are vaches enragées. -That's exactly what we are. Mad cows.
But I can't bring myself to say this to Louisette.
-You're going to have to do it. -I will do it. We must be cold-blooded.
I shall love her much more when this is settled.
It isn't that you're not helping to some extent.
But I am helping.
It was my idea to add peas to the coq au vin recipe.
We know, and that was a wonderful idea...
...but the book has become a magnum opus.
But we are a team.
We are Les Trois Gourmandes. One for all.
Yes, it's absolutely true, Louisette. Yes, it's true.
And you have been very valuable to the project.
-Thank you. -But....
But....
I am getting a divorce.
-What? -Jean-Luc is leaving me.
I'm so sorry. Oh, Louisette. Just forget that I even mentioned it.
But it isn't fair for Louisette to get the same money.
This is not the time. She's getting a divorce.
But she doesn't do the work.
You don't do the work, so your share should be 10 percent.
Ten percent?
You're not doing the work.
Twenty-five.
-Fifteen. -Twenty.
Eighteen and not a penny more.
And where it says our names, I think it should say:
"By Julia Child and Simone Beck, with Louisette Bertholle."
-"With"? -And in smaller type.
No, no, no, Simca.
Our names exactly the-- And alphabetical. Alphabetical.
But it was not even her idea to put the peas in the coq au vin.
-No. -But it bothers me.
For me?
Dear Avis, we've been through our own version of Kafka.
Paul went off to Washington, and in my innocence...
...I thought it must be because the United States government...
...had finally realized how valuable he was.
Far from it. He was being investigated.
He spent three days being grilled in a windowless room...
...with a foot-high stack of papers ominously sitting on the table.
They asked him about our friends, our books...
...our China years, our patriotism.
They even asked him if he was a homosexual.
-Are you a homosexual, Mr. Child? -No.
I am not a homosexual.
This is not a joke.
I'm well aware of that.
He came home exonerated but thoroughly bruised.
Julia, it was a nightmare.
What am I going to do?
I feel like my entire life has been a waste.
-Paul. -I have one more posting...
...then I'll retire and then what?
We'll figure it out.
I just don't know what it was all for.
You know?
You at least have the book.
Well, it's your book too.
It is.
Without you, it wouldn't be a book.
Not that Simca and I will ever be done with it.
-Someday you'll be done with it. -I'm beginning to wonder.
So to wrap things up...
...at 6:22 last night, guess who wasn't coming to dinner.
That's right.
It began pouring down rain and Judith Jones canceled.
I was utterly crushed.
On top of everything...
...I had a horrible fight with my husband and he left me.
The boeuf bourguignon was delicious, not that I ate it.
As for the raspberry Bavarian cream, I am taking it to the office.
Morning.
Julie, could you come in here?
I didn't tell him, I swear.
Julie?
-Feeling better? -Much.
So you burned the stew?
That's not why I didn't come to work. I didn't come because I had...
-Stomach flu. -...stomach flu.
Listen, it's a free country.
But this thing of yours on the Internet, I do not want to show up in it. Okay?
And if you don't feel like coming in to work, let me know.
Somebody will want this job. We're trying to do something here.
I'm sorry.
Anyone else would fire you.
A Republican would fire you.
I'm not a schmuck.
I'm in shock. I can't believe it.
You're like "The Ones." If you and Eric can't make it work, who can?
All sorts of people can. Just not me because I am a bitch.
I am, Sarah. I'm a bitch.
I know. I know you are.
By the way, Garth and I broke up.
I didn't even ask. I am a one-way street, just like Eric says.
It's okay. I wasn't in love with him.
Do you really think I'm a bitch?
-Well, yeah. -I know.
But who isn't?
Julia.
I've been thinking about me and Julia.
She was a secretary for a government agency and I am too.
A really nice guy married her. A really nice guy married me.
Both of us were lost...
...and both of us were saved by food in some way or other.
So major overlaps. But let's face it, I am not Julia Child.
Julia Child never lost her temper just because something boiled over...
...or collapsed in the oven, or just plain fell through.
And she was never horrible to her husband, I'm sure.
She never behaved like, "Who has time to be married?"
Which is how I behave sometimes, I'm sorry to say.
I wish I were more like her. She deserved her husband and I don't.
That's the truth.
Well, anyway, that's the truth for now.
Yogurt for dinner.
Hi, you've reached Eric Powell at Archaeology magazine.
Leave a message.
I hated sleeping without you last night.
Where are you?
I miss you.
-Hello? -Honey, is something wrong?
No.
Why would you think that?
Are you and Eric having some kind of problem?
Of course not.
-Is he there and you can't talk? -He's not here.
I just read your blog, and it was strange and uncharacteristically thoughtful.
-Where is he? -Out.
He went out to get pizza.
Have you stopped cooking?
Just temporarily. Just taking a little break from cooking.
Well, get back to it.
It's gonna be good for you to finish something for once in your life.
-Julia didn't give up. -Who says I'm giving up?
Well, I'm just saying don't.
Hey.
Are you back?
Please be back.
What's for dinner?
Well, Avis said she'd be here. Even if we were late.
Well, if she's not here, we can take a taxi.
They probably have taxis in Boston.
Oh, she'll be here. Wearing a plaid jacket.
That's how I'm to recognize her.
What do you mean, "recognize her"? Has she changed?
Well....
"Look for the middle-aged woman in a plaid jacket."
-So.... -You and Avis have never met?
We're just pen pals.
You don't know each other?
Well, we do. We write.
But how did you start writing one another?
That's a long story.
Avis' husband, Bernard De Voto, now dead...
...was a wonderful, wonderful writer.
He wrote an article in Harper's Magazine all about stainless steel knives...
-...and how he absolutely detested them. -Yes.
And so I wrote him a fan letter because he was 100 percent right.
And Avis wrote me back.
And so I wrote her back. And she wrote me back.
Well, it's been eight years, I think.
-Avis. -Julia.
-My darling friend. -Look at you.
Brilliant friend. Bless you.
This is a very impressive undertaking, Mrs. Child, and Mrs. Beck.
Well, thank you very, very much.
And your editor loves it.
I do. I think it's brilliant.
There's really nothing else like it on the market.
-The problem is not just the length. -It's 700 pages.
-Yes, we know. It is long. -Yes, we know it's long.
You have 700 pages of just sauce and poultry recipes.
We were thinking that you could publish it in a series of volumes.
Volume One, Sauces.
-Volume Two-- -Poultry.
Yes.
Volume Three, Fish. Meat, vegetables, and desserts.
That's one, two, three.... That's six volumes.
Eggs.
-Eggs. -Eggs. Seven. Seven volumes.
But we don't want to publish an encyclopedia.
I thought this was intended for housewives.
Yes, housewives want something quick, with a mix.
Like this.
But if I may speak for everyone...
...if you were willing to revise it, I'm sure we would all be interested.
Oh, Simca, I am so sorry.
You just picked the wrong collaborator.
Yes, I should have worked with this woman.
"Baked Alaska in a Flower Pot."
We'll just take the book away from Houghton Mifflin...
...and find another publisher.
We have just begun to fight. Julia, your book is a masterpiece.
What is Marshmallow Fluff?
And keep the advance, by the way. Keep the entire $250.
Don't give them back a penny of it.
Why did we ever decide to do this anyway?
What were we thinking?
Who can remember?
I can.
We wanted to write a French cookbook...
...for American women who do not have cooks.
So then, that's what we'll do. We'll just do it all over again.
And that's that. It'll be easy.
It will. The dessert section is done. Thanks to Simca, it is brilliant.
Thank you.
I just haven't typed it up yet.
But that will give me something to do in Oslo.
Eric, come see the world's most beautiful chicken.
Naughty.
Oh, my God.
This is so-- No, I'm serious. I love it.
I just want to savor this moment.
The moment when anything is possible.
The moment that you can just imagine they're going to love everything you did...
...and it's going to sell a million copies and change the world.
Yes. But I think it calls for a great bottle of wine.
-Don't you think? -Yes.
What's for dinner?
What if she doesn't eat pork?
She's a food writer. Of course she eats pork. You'll be fine.
You're right. I know you're right. I'm sure you're right.
-Is she early? -She's right on time.
-I'll finish. -Thank you.
You are a terrible human being. And very difficult to live with.
Who is it?
Amanda Hesser from The New York Times.
Come in.
You have a sense of Julia when you do something like this.
As a teacher, as a voice.
I have conversations with her while I'm cooking.
And I feel like she is there with me in the kitchen.
-She's like your imaginary friend. -Yes.
She is the person I write for every day.
Although, I don't think she reads it. I don't know. I'm dying to meet her.
I would like to be a bridesmaid in her wedding in 1946.
I realize that that would take an inexplicable episode of time travel...
...but that is the sort of thing that I think about.
We're planning a pilgrimage to Julia's kitchen in the Smithsonian museum...
-...when this is over. -But first I have to finish.
I have 15 days and 24 recipes...
...and I still have to bone a duck.
I read that it was bad form to say "yum" while you're eating, but yum.
Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, please hold.
Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Can you hold?
-Yes. -Great.
-Lower Manhattan Devel-- -Julie, it's Sarah.
-The New York Times. I can't believe it. -I know. I know, I know, I know.
Can I call you back? I have to call you back. Hold on.
Hello, how can I help you?
-Hi. -Hey.
Guess what? Messages on machine?
Sixty-five.
-Sixty-five? -Sixty-five.
If this is the Julie Powell in this morning's New York Times, this is Judy Clain.
I'm an editor at Little Brown and I wanted to talk to you about...
...whether you were interested in writing a book.
Call me at 212-049-0067.
Hi, this is Sarah Chalfant. I'm a literary agent.
I would love to talk to you about representing you.
-I'm a producer at CBS Morning News. -Eric, I'm going to be a writer.
You are a writer.
This is Ruth Spungen, I'm an editor at Food & Wine Magazine.
Please give me a call at 212-157-3245.
-I have to make a pear tart. -Later.
Hi, it's Mom. Oh, you're in The New York Times!
I can't tell you, everybody is calling.
Aunt Jessie's cousin Dorrie in Abilene...
...the one with the husband who won the pie-eating contest...
...they have a subscription to The New York Times.
They saw it in Abilene. Everyone is so excited.
This is Ken Dryer. I'm an editor at Random House.
-I read your blog and it's great. -I'm a literary agent....
I'm an editor at Bon Appétit.
I'm a producer at the Food Network. We'd love to meet you.
We have some ideas.
Whether you're thinking of turning this into--
-A book. -A movie.
-A television series. -A one-woman show.
-Call me -Call me.
Call me.
Thank you, God.
Gimlets.
-Here you go. -Thank you.
-Hi, this is Julie. -And Eric.
-And we are busy cooking. -And blogging.
-And other stuff, so leave a message. -That's good.
-You make them better. -I just make them stronger.
It's Barry Ryan from the Santa Barbara News-Press.
I'm writing an article about Julia Child's 90th birthday...
...and I asked her about your blog.
Frankly, she was kind of a pill about it. I thought maybe you'd want to comment.
Hello?
Yes, it is.
She said that?
Julia Child said that?
Has she read my blog?
No, I don't really wanna comment.
But thank you for calling.
Julia hates me.
Jule?
They hate us.
Who?
Houghton Mifflin.
-They don't hate you. -They do. They absolutely do.
No, they say the book is good.
But they don't want to publish it.
Well, they think it's too expensive. They think it's "economically prohibitive."
Eight years of our lives just turned out to be something for me to do...
...so I wouldn't have nothing to do.
Oh, well.
Boo-hoo.
Now what?
-You're a teacher. -Yeah.
You can teach.
Right? We'll go home and....
Where's home?
Where do we live?
-Home is wherever we are. -Yeah.
All right? And we'll work it out. We'll figure it out.
-You can teach in our kitchen. -True.
You can teach on television.
Television?
-Me? -Yes.
-Oh, Paul. -Oh, no, Julia.
I think you would be excellent on television. I do.
-Paul. -I do. I do.
Don't.
I'm not kidding you. I'm not.
Someone is going to publish your book.
Someone is going to read your book and realize what you've done.
Because your book is amazing.
Your book is a work of genius.
Your book is going to change the world.
Do you hear me?
You are so sweet.
You are...
...the sweetest man.
Fuck them.
Judith, would you take a look at this?
Our intrepid literary scout, Avis De Voto...
...is friends with some woman who's written a huge French cookbook.
Houghton Mifflin just turned it down.
"French Recipes for American Cooks." Terrible title.
Have fun, Judith.
Yum.
Yum.
Oh, my.
-Oh, here it is. Of course. -What...?
-Who's that? -I don't know.
Special delivery for Mrs. Julia Child.
-Chilly. -Yes.
-There you are. -Thank you.
Dear Mrs. Child...
...we have read your superb French cookbook...
...studying it, cooking from it, estimating, and so on.
We have come to the conclusion that it is a unique book...
...that we would be very proud to publish.
Paul. Paul.
What? What, what, what?
Knopf....
Knopf wants to publish our book.
Is it "K-nopf" or "Nopf"?
-Who cares? -Who cares?
They want to offer us an advance of $1500.
Oh, my God.
"We believe that your book will do for French cooking in America...
...what Rombauer's the Joy of Cooking did for standard cooking.
And we will sell it that way."
Oh, Julia!
When we meet, which I hope will be very soon...
...I especially wanna talk to you about the title of the book.
It is of the utmost importance that the title distinguish this book...
...from all the other cookbooks on the market.
-Is this the way you normally do this? -Absolutely not.
"Mastering the Art of French Cooking."
What do you think?
Well, at this point, I have no idea whatsoever.
-Julia, that won't do. -All right then.
I love it.
She said "hate"? Julia Child used the word "hate"?
No.
But she said I wasn't respectful, or serious, or something.
How much more serious could a person be?
Do you think she thinks I'm sort of using her?
She can't have read your blog.
-Did she read it? -He didn't know if she'd read it.
But she definitely had an opinion about it.
Do you think it's because I use the "F" word every so often?
Could be. Who knows?
Look, there's something wrong with her if she doesn't get what you're doing.
There is nothing wrong with her. I've spent a year with her. She's perfect.
The Julia Child in your head is perfect.
The Julia Child that doesn't understand what you're doing is not perfect.
The one in your head is the one that matters.
I'm never gonna meet her.
But you already know her.
-Thank you. -You're welcome. Anytime.
-She saved me. -You saved yourself.
I was drowning and she pulled me out of the ocean.
Don't get carried away.
Julia Child began learning to cook...
...because she loved her husband, loved food...
...and didn't know what else to do with herself.
In the process, she found joy.
I didn't understand this for a long time, but I do now.
Julia taught me that.
But here's what Julia really taught me.
She taught me to cook.
So here we are. One day to go and one recipe.
You may think that boning a duck is an impossible feat.
-And the whole procedure... -Nothing is impossible.
...can take as long as 45 minutes the first time because of fear.
Don't be afraid.
No fear, Julia. No fear.
Take your knife, confront the duck.
Confronting the duck. You're my duck.
You make a deep slit down the back of the bird...
...all the way from the neck down to the tail to expose the backbone.
And with a small, sharp knife, its edge always cutting against the bone....
I did it. Look at that, Julia. It looks just like yours.
--down one side of the bird, pulling the flesh....
Thread the boned duck on a board, face skin side down.
--patting it into place. Roll out the dough.
--two hours and remove it from the oven and let it cool for several hours.
It looks exactly the way it's supposed to look.
Here you go. Can you grab the plates too?
-You sure? -I got it.
Coming around.
Here she comes.
Thank you.
Three hundred and sixty-five days, 524 recipes.
-Congratulations. -Thank you, guys.
Babe, it's fantastic.
So great.
I love it. I love it.
Eric, I could never have done this without you.
As someone once said...
...you are the butter to my bread, the breath to my life.
To my husband.
I love you, babe.
Thank you.
So it's over.
The project has come to a close. We're back exactly where we started...
...Eric, me, the cat, slightly worse for wear...
...sitting in the outer boroughs, eating.
So thanks, everybody.
And guess what?
See how the counters are raised? She had them made special.
There's her famous mortar and pestle.
If you say so.
-Perfect. -Take my picture.
Okay.
That's nice. Give me something else.
Here we go. Talking to her.
That's good.
-One more. -Very sweet.
That's it. That's the one.
That's the one.
Just give me a second.
I love you, Julia.
There you are.
Well, he was a Brazilian.
It's a place where he was a son, he was...
the man from Rio de Janeiro.
He was anonymous.
He could become himself.
Sérgio had a well-worked tradition.
Every time he would land in Rio de Janeiro,
we would rush to Gilda's house, to his mother's house,
drop the luggage, dash to the beach, to his favorite corner,
run straight into the water
and the moment that he would go and put his head under the water
and emerge up, he would say, "Ah, yes.
I have arrived."
[man] So, what were you wishing to say?
Well, you're going to speak to the people.
-Really? -Going to have 35 new staff members...
-I see. -...where Gary is now, so...
I see. Some spontaneous wisdom.
Huh?
[reporter] Just how you came to be the High Commissioner?
Oh, my God, but you realize I can't summarize 34 years
in three minutes.
That's a huge theme.
'Cause you're asking me to recount my life. [laughs]
But I suppose it's, uh...
it's intended to be inspirational, right?
[reporter] Absolutely.
Hi, good afternoon.
My name is Sérgio Vieira de Mello.
I'm Brazilian and I'm presently
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
I joined the organization at the age of 21, believe it or not.
Just out of university.
[Sérgio] I was lucky to have served in East Pakistan,
Cyprus, South America, Bosnia, Lebanon,
Cambodia, Kosovo, and from there, East Timor.
This organization is the best opportunity you have in your life
of achieving your dreams.
Never forget the real challenges,
and the real rewards of serving the United Nations
are out there in the field where people are suffering, where people need you.
[George Bush] Remember Rwanda or Kosovo, the UN didn't do its job.
Will the United Nations serve the purpose of its founding...
or will it be irrelevant?
[reporter 1] The President said last night
that he is prepared to invade with or without the backing of the United Nations.
[reporter 2] So, President Bush made it clear, no time left for stately diplomatic
waltzes at the United Nations.
It's now the Texas two-step from here on out.
So we just met with the President and he explained
the position of the United States,
which I think you're all aware.
I reminded him of the position of the Secretary General on this issue.
But I don't think anyone can predict
what the human cost of such a war would be,
but it will be high by definition.
[Tony Blair] The conflict in Iraq
and the removal of Saddam had been immensely controversial.
It had been deeply opposed by many within the international community.
It split the UN Security Council.
So I thought it was particularly important that the UN were in a prime role.
[Samantha Power] The countries that had fought
so fiercely over whether to go for war,
decided that they had to somehow kiss and make up.
"Let's agree that we all have an interest in seeing Iraq stabilized.
Let's send a United Nations mission,
and much more importantly, in a way, let's send the most charismatic,
most experienced person in the entire system of conflict management,
conflict prevention, nation building, refugee care, you name it.
Let's send this guy who's known as a cross between James Bond and Bobby Kennedy.
Let's send Sérgio."
[Condoleezza Rice] I asked him personally to take the job in Iraq.
I said, "You're the right person for this job and I hope you'll do it."
President Bush, I know, had met him and, I think, rated him very highly.
Um, and, yeah, there was therefore a general consensus
that if he could be persuaded to do it, he would be the right person.
[Carolina Larriera] He never wanted the job in Iraq.
But that week he called me to say
that he had just received a phone call from New York,
where the Secretary General was asking him to go and see him.
And I ask him, "Is that to talk about what? About Iraq?
But you were already clear about your position vis-à-vis Iraq."
Sérgio, with his friends, was absolutely adamantly saying, "No way, forget it.
Are you crazy?
I've just got a new job, and here with Carolina, etc., etc..."
Gradually the interest mounted and the pressures mounted
and, uh, he clearly became more interested and, uh...
was finally influenced I think, by the profile of the issue.
It was the center stage of international UN action in 2003.
I have asked Mr. Sérgio de Mello to serve as my special representative.
He will lead the UN effort in Iraq...
for the next four months.
[Power] He went to Iraq with a cadre of experts
on constitutions, elections, policing, refugees...
The best and brightest of international community.
He felt like he had all that he needed for success,
and the way he defines success was a speedy end to the occupation,
and a smooth and peaceful transition
to a brighter post-Saddam independent future.
We see our role as one that supports the Iraqis to replace
as soon as possible the coalition
and recover fully their sovereignty.
No one likes to be under occupation.
And I often ask myself how would I feel
if I saw foreign tanks in the streets of Rio de Janeiro, my home town.
I wouldn't like it
and I would want that to come to an end very, very quickly.
And I would have wanted it not to happen in the first place.
[Larriera] Sérgio was exhausted. It was the month of August.
It was extremely hot in Baghdad.
We got up early. We met our other colleagues downstairs,
and then, uh, headed all together to the Canal Hotel.
He ate breakfast quickly.
He stood up.
The convoy was ready to leave
and he looked very distant.
I could see him,
his forehead was against the window
looking outside
and I knew he wasn't well. I don't know why.
[Power in English] On August 19th, he was preparing to issue two statements.
Two open criticisms of the coalition for their excessive use of force.
He knew the Americans would go nuts,
and yet Sérgio understood if he didn't take this step,
the United Nations would continue more and more to just be seen as an accomplice
of the United States.
He had a meeting with Paul Bremer.
The convoy was ready to go, we were all about to leave
and we got a call from the US Command Center.
They said the meeting with Bremer was canceled.
[in English] Unexpectedly, the meeting had been cancelled,
so he ended up remaining in the office
and called me in at lunchtime to have lunch with him.
I told him that I was going to stay in and skip lunch and just work through.
Then I knew that in the afternoon he was having another series of meetings
and we were going to meet each other again.
[Gil Loescher] We arrived in Baghdad that morning.
It was a short initial trip to get a feel for the lay of the land.
We went directly to the headquarters of the Coalition Provisional Authority
and saw Paul Bremer.
My abiding memory of the interview was that, at the very end he said,
"You know, the security situation is improving,
in fact it's, you know, it's, it's in very good shape."
From there we went to the United Nations.
We wanted to hear from Sérgio what he thought the UN had been able to achieve.
We were early for the meeting.
Someone came and let us up, I think it was the third floor,
to Sérgio's office.
I signaled to Sérgio that it was okay.
So he stood up
and went to sit with his guests.
[in English] Sérgio was at his desk and was putting papers together,
and then he came over to us and sat us down.
I was sitting directly opposite him, just a couple of feet away.
I think we will be surprised at the highlight of causalities that we have.
Specifically with the unexploded ordinance.
And in our landmine impact survey in the north we found that...
-eighty-- -[explosion]
-[man] Stay where you are! -[people screaming]
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are!
[man] Tell your people to stay near a wall, please.
The first thing I did was make sure I was not hurt,
and that I had all my arms and legs.
I couldn't hear.
Then I think, "Oh, my God, my boss."
[Ghassan Salamé] When the explosion took place, I thought it was a mortar.
Which tells you that even after many years in Beirut,
you still can be wrong on things.
When Ghassan stood up,
he-- he had some kind of very strange kind of smile that...
he's okay,
and then immediately he said, "Let us go and see what's happened to the people."
I took my telephone, took my neck tie, my jacket, my laptop, my passport,
and I went out and I discovered that...
a lot of people were shouting, crying, bleeding.
[Taher] We could see blood everywhere.
On the walls of the corridor, body is there...
You don't know if they're alive or not.
And things burning...
The smell of burn, the smell of blood.
I stood up and I see Mona Rishmawi across from me
and I see her looking at me
and there's a drip of blood that is coming down her forehead.
[Mona Rishmawi] And then I came to the first floor,
my husband was in the first floor.
So I called him, I said, "Andrew? Andrew?" And miraculously he came out,
I'll never forget this.
And the moment he took my hand, Carolina said, "Sérgio. Sérgio. Sérgio,"
and she said, "I have to find Sérgio."
[Larriera] I started screaming.
I cannot see anything because it's all dust.
I couldn't see. I saw this light, this blinding light all around me,
and, uh...
and suddenly the dust starts to settle,
and I realize that this light is the sun.
The sunlight of 4:00 p.m. Baghdad.
[William von Zehle] We were about 100 meters from the point of the blast.
Bent over to pick up the paper work and the next thing I knew,
I saw this intensely bright flash
and I had about an eighth of a second to think what the--
And then when I woke up I was lying across the room.
Minutes ago, an explosion ripped through a hotel in central Baghdad,
the headquarters for the UN. An update live...
[reporter 1] ...by far the most serious attack that's been,
since US troops took Baghdad.
[reporter 2] First this hour, terrorism in Baghdad.
Right now at least 14 people are dead, dozens wounded...
[reporter 3] A bomb exploded directly below
the office of its special representative here, Sérgio de Mello.
The UN has been there in what used to be the Canal Hotel since the early 1990s.
Three hundred UN staff work inside.
It's home to several UN humanitarian agencies,
all working on the rebuilding of Iraq.
I entered and saw Buenaventura,
the assistant,
he was dead.
I entered Jonathan's office,
Rick was there,
also dead.
And after Jonathan's office,
emptiness.
No office.
I called, "Sérgio! Sérgio!"
No response.
I went outside the building
and I climbed around it.
I climbed on top of the rubble
to try to find Sérgio.
And with me, there was an Australian,
Jeff, the military attaché for Sérgio.
[in English] I was calling out, stopping, listening.
Move a meter, call out, stop, listen.
There was this other fellow who was running towards the rubble,
who was in US military uniform.
I said, "Who are you?" And he said, "My name's Bill."
The gentleman in a blue UN baseball cap came up and he said,
something to the effect of like, "Where are the rest of your guys?"
And I said, "There are no rest of our guys,
it's me and a captain right now."
I want to go in the building and do an internal reconnaissance and see.
I must be nuts to even think about going in the building.
But firefighters have this thing, we run into burning buildings
when everybody else is running out of burning buildings.
We made our way upstairs and it was almost unrecognizable.
I'd been up there on many occasions, for meetings...
As we walked along, I was looking
and at one point I found a little spot of light down below.
If you looked in there, I could see two people.
[Loescher] The flash is what I remember.
The ceiling collapsed, the floor collapsed.
We were thrust down.
I heard someone say, "Oh, shit!"
As if someone had expected it.
I'm pretty sure it was Sérgio.
The next thing I remember is regaining consciousness
and not being able to move.
I remember looking up, um...
at, at someone...
who was wearing a...
like a fireman's hat or, or helmet,
and, and I sort of waved at him.
It may sound melodramatic, but honestly from looking at it
I was pretty convinced that this was gonna be a one-way trip. Um...
You know, I'd seen Oklahoma City done enough collapse-rescue stuff,
and the building, it was still moving.
Uh, you know, bricks were still falling,
it was, you know, within a few minutes of the blast.
I was kind of convinced this was a one-way trip,
and I said, you know, "Tell my wife and, uh, my daughter I love them."
I took my body armor off and started to climb down the hole.
I got down to about... [sighs] where the first floor would be.
At that point I had to turn around in a space
and basically slide down head first, so I could get next to him.
And fortunately there was a piece of reinforcing rod, a rebar,
that was sticking out of a concrete and I put my shoulder up against that.
It was perfect, where I could basically lean down
and, you know, touch them.
Um, and that's when I first introduced myself when I said,
you know, "My name is Bill. I'm a civilian EMT. I'm from the army unit.
I promise I'm gonna get you guys out of here alive."
I remember saying my name to that person.
Telling him that my name was Gil.
I remember very little else.
One gentleman said "My name is Gil," and he was directly in front of me.
There was another gentleman, and he said his name was Sérgio.
As we're talking, you know, he starts to say, I thought he initially said,
"Don't pull me out." And I said, "Don't worry. We're gonna get you both out.
I promise we'll get you both out."
And he goes, "No, no. Don't let them pull the mission out."
And at this point, I'm still not sure who he is.
Then he's asking about, you know, the other people.
"How many people are killed? How many people are wounded?
Do we know what happened?"
And suddenly I'm dawning, this guy's somebody who's, you know, in charge.
It's not just a worker, he's asking questions as the guy in charge.
And it dawned on me, "Jesus, this is Sérgio de Mello."
He had such perfect teeth.
He was a happy boy, always laughing,
always in a good mood.
People would ask him to sing everywhere.
When he was about three years old
he could sing in four languages.
We moved to Italy.
There he attended a Catholic school.
[Power in English] Sérgio was the son of a Brazilian diplomat,
so he spent most of his childhood years abroad, in Europe, mainly.
In Genoa, in Milan, in Rome,
uh, Naples, and even in Beirut.
Through that vagabond life, this was just second nature to him.
His capacity to just descend into a new place and look around and say,
"Okay, I'm home."
And then finally he went to a French school
at the Sorbonne
[Power in English] He became activated politically,
partly by the philosophy, and mainly by what was going on
on the campus of the Sorbonne at that time.
It was 1968, war in Vietnam was raging,
um, students and workers throughout France were striking.
And of course in May of '68,
the students ended up affectively taking over the campus.
Sérgio manned the barricades, threw stones at the police.
What's amazing about his politics in those days is,
how dogmatic he is,
how virulent his anti-Americanism, his anti-imperialism,
even his Marxism or Neo-Marxism is.
I mean, he is a revolutionary to the core.
He graduated from the Sorbonne in 1969.
One of his best friends lived in Geneva,
and Sérgio, looking for work, went and crashed at his place.
Got some interviews with international organizations,
and ended up at the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
[McNamara] Those of us who joined in the '70s really worked on Third World issues.
It was well regarded,
it was expanding rapidly,
it had an interesting mandate of not just aid, but also protection,
it was politically very active in the sense,
that it was on hot borders and conflict areas.
The turning point of Sérgio's relationship to his new place of employment
was his first field mission,
uh, which was in Bangladesh.
Here Sérgio is tasked as a very young man to help provide shelter,
to help provide food, um, to try to come up with some kind of political strategy
by which these people could eventually return to their homes.
He discovered himself.
He suddenly saw extreme poverty, enormous refugee flows,
and the ideals that had motivated him took life, they took flesh.
He realized that he was not merely a man of thought,
but that if he wanted to make those ideals real,
he had to be a man of action.
[McNamara] I met Sérgio first time actually in Swaziland in 1976,
to move the Soweto kids who'd been attacked by the South African police,
out of Swaziland to Tanzania.
This was a very hot operation, as you can imagine
the South African security were all over the place,
but we evacuated them through Mozambique.
Sérgio was the acting UNHCR person in Maputo.
[Richard Holbrooke] I met Sérgio Vieira de Mello in Cambodia and Thailand
when the Khmer Rouge were driven out of power
and a massive refugee crisis ensued.
This is what brought a whole generation of people
into the international humanitarian effort.
You're a better agronomist than I am.
[grunts] Voilà.
[Holbrooke] Sérgio was the most dazzling, charismatic person in that area.
[Sérgio] I better not shower him.
[Holbrooke] How could a guy this charismatic, this good looking,
be doing this kind of work?
Well, he was one of the bright stars, no question.
Probably, maybe, the brightest.
He was the master magician,
mediator, manager, massager of egos.
[reporter] Would you mind spelling your last name?
[chuckles] V-I-E-I-R-A D-E M-E-L-L-O.
The mission was to return between 350 and 400,000 refugees
who were primarily living on the borders with Thailand in refugee camps
for a prolonged period of time already
to return them ahead of the elections that were scheduled to take place.
Sérgio was convinced that the only way to make the repatriation a success
was to work with the Khmer Rouge.
But this was controversial because...
they were what they were. They, they...
Their senior leadership had been part of a genocidal regime.
[McNamara] He had a long fascination with evil genius.
The mind of evil men and how they functioned and why.
Especially intellectual evil, as the Khmer Rouge were.
There was no question it was high risk and it shouldn't have happened.
It was all done, um, in a bit of a...
an unorthodox way.
There was a meeting place which was in the middle of nowhere.
We had no idea where we were going.
I remember Sérgio's driver declared him, basically, insane.
We had to walk through minefields.
There was no radio contact.
And it was an hour and a half by tractor trailer
to a miniscule kind of settlement headquarters.
We spent the rest of the day there and evening and had discussions with them
about the land and where people could return.
It was just an extraordinary experience.
Sérgio never underestimated, of course, who he was dealing with
and what their, their historical baggage was,
but that did not cause him to think that he shouldn't talk to them.
He wasn't a black or white kind of guy.
[McNamara] War Criminals, My Friends
is what his autobiography could have been called.
He was rather inclined to see a broader view, perhaps, than many of us would.
Uh, I would be the dogmatic, uh...
human rights approach that these guys were war criminals
and should be put on trial immediately.
He told me to stop, get off my high horse.
I think, and it was a breakthrough.
It was the first time that the UN,
and probably foreigners for that matter,
were in touch with the official Khmer governing structure.
Sérgio managed to convince at least some leading members of the Khmer Rouge
that cooperation with the international community
was a more constructive approach,
and more in their self-interest than sabotage.
More tangibly, he managed to produce one of the few concrete successes
of a long international and a very expensive international engagement in Cambodia...
the return of 400,000 Cambodians to their homes.
[Bos] I think there was a huge sense of being vindicated.
I think you can almost see a sense of satisfaction on his face
that they're able to take their destiny in their own hands.
May they be blessed with happiness, lasting peace, and prosperity.
We are all here betting on peace.
We will, as from this morning,
and with deep emotion, escort you home.
Thank you.
From that point forward, he wasn't just a UN success story,
or a humanitarian success story,
he was an individual that governments thought about as a problem solver,
as a troubleshooter, as a go-to guy.
As someone that you could put into harm's way,
have talk to the world's most dangerous people,
and he could somehow pull rabbits out of the hat.
I already looked at him like 007.
He never dies.
I asked him one time, "Sérgio,
why do you go to all these countries,
that have such conflicts, that are so dangerous?"
He just laughed
and didn't reply.
[Vance Kuhner] It sounded to me like a 500-pound bomb
had gone off, and very close.
I went down on one knee
and when I stood back up again, I looked at my first sergeant and I said,
"Let's go. Let's get in the truck."
My driver said, "Where to go?" I said, "You see the smoke?
Follow the smoke."
My philosophy of the UN was not 100%.
The UN believes a lot of talking will solve all the problems,
and they don't.
Sometimes you need to have brute force.
On that day it didn't make any difference.
There were people there that needed our help,
and my job was to accomplish that.
[Kuhner] I wasn't prepared for what I'd saw.
Mass chaos.
Wounded people everywhere.
I saw one man, he had a piece of rebar that was stuck through his cheeks
and he was sitting there smoking a cigarette.
Absolute insanity.
Time was our enemy.
We needed to start moving people.
[Valentine] It looked like a car bomb came in
and it was setting off all the other vehicles that were next to it.
We had people that were crawling out of the building.
So I said, "Okay, I'll take control of this."
This little section, this little island,
dirt island is gonna be our triage and staging area right now.
We had to make decisions on who was gonna live and who was gonna die.
[William] One of the things we have in civilian medical world
is called the "Golden Hour."
Basically if you can get somebody to the trauma center
within 60 minutes from injury,
if you can get him there alive, they have a pretty good chance of surviving.
At least in the Western world.
At this point, I don't hear anybody calling,
it's just a quiet little womb in there,
it's hotter than you know what.
Both men were covered in brick and debris from the waist down.
Sérgio was actually more almost chest high.
You couldn't see that anything was broken or out of place,
but he was covered completely.
They both had severe lower extremity injuries.
Gil, you could see, his left leg was folded up.
Uh, Sérgio, we presumed he's got that much weight on him, he's got crush injuries.
I was able to start an IV on Gil Loescher.
I could not get to Sérgio de Mello well enough to get an IV going.
I just physically couldn't get in there without lying on top of Gil.
I knew we had no heavy equipment,
so I knew the only way we're gonna get these guys out is the old-fashioned way
so I started taking bricks, you know, a couple of bricks at a time,
throwing them up in the opening,
go back down, get a couple more bricks
and just, to try to get these guys uncovered.
[Valentine] We saw about 185 people,
and we moved 130 of them in 55 minutes in whatever vehicle we could find,
uh, Deuce and a Half, 5 tons, pick-up trucks.
[Kuhner] MPU's were arriving at this point
and they've set up a 360 degree security perimeter on the outside.
Sorry, I need you to back up.
We then set to work searching the building and looking for survivors.
[Valentine] Probably about an hour or so down the line,
I heard a cry that there's more people up here.
So I said, "Okay, I'm going upstairs to check."
I went floor to floor, room to room
till I got to the top floor and I heard another cry there,
and that's where I met Bill.
About 40 minutes after I arrived, I hear somebody yelling from up above,
and the guy goes, "Do you need any help?"
And the last thing I wanted was somebody wo had no training down there,
gonna make more problem, knock more bricks down,
and I said, "You have any experience?"
and he said "I'm a New York City firefighter paramedic,"
and I said, "Come on down."
[Valentine] I looked at the hole
and I just said "Holy crap!"
Here would be the third floor...
looking at it from the side.
When it collapsed, the roof basically went...
And Sérgio's office would've been somewhere... in here.
The second floor had collapsed partially down.
They were basically here. Their heads were down.
Now, they would be next to each other. So this would, let's say, be Gil Loescher
here in his feet...
To his right behind him, on that diagram,
Sérgio would be basically in the same position.
Several bodies were actually located in this area, over here.
That were, the other people that were in the meeting.
We treat everybody in the EMS the same.
If I could have gotten Sérgio out first, would I?
All things being equal, maybe.
But if it could have been the President of United States
and I would've had to get Gil Loescher out first
physically to get room to pull Sérgio out.
I said "Let me go down, you've already gone your turn."
My little one-man hole in the ground became a two-man hole in the ground,
and we spent the next, uh, two, three hours working together like a team,
uh, trying to get these guys out of there.
[Valentine] I had to climb over two victims. First victim was a female.
She had, uh, this side of the face covered with a concrete slab.
Uh, she had what we call agonal breaths, but still had a pulse.
She had a real severe head injury, I knew she wasn't gonna be survivable.
I told her to hang on and I said "Keep your faith,
and I said that God is with you," and she squeezed my hand.
So I'm assuming, because in the medical community
the last thing that goes is your hearing,
so I really believe the lady heard me.
I quietly pray, and I tell him "Jesus loves you."
I do that automatically.
Some of my co-workers think I'm crazy, but, you know, that's who I am.
I continue to go down.
I finally got down to the bottom of the first floor,
and I heard two people, they were talking, and one was Sérgio,
he was to the left of me and Gil was more or less straight right in front of me.
He was conscious, he knew what was going on,
he knew what happened, he knew where he was.
Uh, he knew his name, he knew how old he was and where he was from.
Uh, and he told me he was from Oxford, England.
He was an American working there.
I'm told that I was conscious for most of that time,
but I don't remember.
[Valentine] I told him, "I'm gonna continue to work while you talk."
He was telling me about his family, his wife and his two lovely daughters.
I said, "This is my promise to you...
I will get you out of here alive if you stay with me."
The earth was smoldering.
We were digging with our bare hands.
We had no shovels or equipment.
We kept calling Sérgio's name over and over.
[Davie in English] My memory was of dirt.
I was surprised about how much dirt there was.
I remember thinking I'm going to move a piece of rubble and he will be there.
I then saw a slit.
I put my head in and called out again, and it was Sérgio.
I just felt wonderful, you know.
He was alive, and, uh, and we'd found him.
[Salamé] We found a hole through which we were communicating.
"Sérgio! Sérgio!"
In French... [speaks French]
"We will come and help you. Don't worry."
His first questions of me after I'd asked of him,
were concern for others in the team,
not of himself or of his circumstances.
"Where is Carolina? Where are the others? Please look for them."
Um, "Don't stop."
[William] I was not aware that there were people still working outside of the base
of the opening. I didn't hear anybody.
At this point I was able to yell out one of my sergeants.
I said, "Robbie, I need a rope.
I need something to haul this stuff out, I need lights."
I never saw any equipment, because he was a buck sergeant and as he came through,
now as more and more people were showing up from the army,
higher ranking, it was like, "Hey, we need that rope."
You know, Captain would say "Give me the rope," and he'd say,
"Well, I need it for my first sergeant.
I'm a captain, give me the rope."
You know, "I need it and I'm a colonel, give me..."
Never got any of that stuff.
At that point both of them were lucid, conscious.
I'm just trying to keep them talking.
What I was taught was to get their minds off their injuries.
The survival rate is greater
when we get their mind off of what's going on at that time.
Kind of put them in another area in their life.
Get their mind away from Baghdad.
[Holbrooke] A seminal moment in Sérgio's life came
when East Timor was cut loose from Indonesia
after tremendous fighting and genocide.
We needed a senior UN official to be in effect the president,
the power in an area which was no longer part of Indonesia
and not yet an independent country.
Sérgio Vieira de Mello had the drive, the leadership and the skills to do it,
and it was the biggest test the UN had ever faced in the nation-building phase.
[Larriera] I never heard of Timor in my life.
When I was proposed to go there, I, I could...
I couldn't in a million years have placed it on the map.
I was an economics officer
working in establishing the traditional structure of the new government.
I did know Sérgio Vieira de Mello from Brazil.
My part of the government knew him as the SRSG.
The Special Representative of the Secretary General.
Um, one morning I was running along the beach road,
and I saw this man running with someone else who looks like a bodyguard.
He passed by and I looked at...
You know, I looked at the two and I realized this was the SRSG.
And I'm looking at him thinking,
"Well, I am a woman, here I am running on my own,
why does he need a bodyguard next to him? What a chicken."
[reporter] The two man who hold East Timor's immediate future in their hands
enjoy another rapturous welcome in an East Timorese town.
On this day, Xanana Gusmão has been crowned king of the Ermera regency.
By his side is the man with the real power in East Timor today.
Sérgio de Mello is East Timor's legal leader for the next two years
as it makes its transition to full independence.
Here, Sérgio, a guy who in his early 20s,
you know, had preached against imperialism,
had thrown stones at Parisian police,
and suddenly he was in charge, he was the viceroy.
[Peter Galbraith] United Nations gave Sérgio all the powers of a dictator,
but he never dictated anything.
He set up a consultative council that included the top East Timorese leaders,
and later a cabinet
which included the East Timorese leaders.
And he never took a decision that the East Timorese disagreed with.
East Timor will have an elected representative body
working for the people to frame a constitution
that is of the people.
This is a momentous achievement.
Democracy looks to be in a very healthy state indeed.
[Larriera] The real first time when I talked to Sérgio
was at a formal dinner.
I arrived very early, and, um...
it turned out that the only person who was there,
the first person who was there was Sérgio.
No one else was there, so we... started chatting away.
He told me that he knew I was from Argentina, and that, uh,
he had spent the first days of his life in Argentina, in Buenos Aires,
and I was surprised to hear that.
As he was telling me this, he was drifting away in memories,
until everyone suddenly arrived and our conversation was cut short.
It was that time, it was that day that we had really, you know...
established a connection and liked each other.
He had told me he was separated, you know,
and I assumed that that was a legal separation.
It was later on that he told me that he was not legally separated.
But I must say that in the beginning he was not, you know...
You know,
hundred percent clear from that.
[Power] Sérgio had gotten married very young to Annie
and I don't think when he had his two sons that he would've forecast
that so much of his life would be spent away from his home in France.
He was never a terribly faithful husband.
He had relationships outside his marriage,
um, you know, couple of which were very, very public.
Uh, in Cambodia, he had lived with his girlfriend
and worked with her in the mission.
It was clear to everybody with whom we worked that,
um, we had a relationship.
It was, for me, very difficult because he was married
and we were clearly serious.
I never met his wife but I'm sure she knew.
Sérgio had an eye for women and, uh, enjoyed their company.
A lot.
[Bos] It didn't last.
But we stayed in touch, sort of, and through friends, uh, mutual friends.
Then I remember receiving an email from him that he sent
to his closest friends just before he left for Iraq.
He said, you know, "I'm so happy that I'm...
moving into a phase in my life where I'm...
I'm starting to have a personal life, and I'm looking forward.
This is going to be my last assignment and then...
I want to have a more normal lifestyle and start with Carolina."
What I remember from that email was that he was ready to,
to settle down and start enjoying life.
[Power] With Carolina, he was saying, "This is the woman I'm gonna marry."
He was wearing a ring with her name on it.
She was wearing a ring with his name on it.
He started legal proceedings to end his marriage,
and, uh, with a thought of beginning a new life with Carolina.
He really wanted to have a second chance at having a family.
[Galbraith] I think he did regret not having spent more time with his sons.
On the other hand, it didn't change his behavior,
and he felt drawn intellectually,
uh, and emotionally to the work he was doing. He was ambitious.
He was-- His career was very important to him.
And I think he also felt that he was doing good.
In that scheme of things, spending time with his sons
ended up being less, less important.
But the truth is, had he been a family man,
he would not have done,
he could not have accomplished what he accomplished.
[Larriera] All of a sudden, things just started falling into place.
Yes, independence will take place and yes, we are in love, and...
You know, life cannot be better
than life at that moment in time.
[Holbrooke] It was his success in East Timor
that proved that he was at a unique level.
He inherited this war-torn, genocide-torn half an island,
had presided over it, built it up, and handed it off
as an independent country.
[Larriera] After the ceremony was finished,
several parties were taking place.
The President of the World Bank was toasting with President Clinton,
and many heads of state were in town.
He told me, "Carolina, I don't want to go to any party.
I just want for the two of us to be together,
and let's do our own thing.
Why don't we go for a run?"
As we were running along, the Timorese were recognizing him.
They were saying, "Whoa, look. Here he comes."
I could see Sérgio smiling from ear to ear,
waving his hand to the people, you know,
as if he was waving bye-bye to East Timor.
And many times afterwards, he will bring me back to that moment.
He would take me back to that moment.
"Tell me you remember that night when we went running, the taste of independence,
didn't it feel good? Didn't we do the right thing?"
Let us examine the stand of the West and the United Nations in Indonesia
when they moved to divide the largest country in the Islamic world...
[in English] Osama bin Laden had issued a statement saying that, uh,
jihadis all over the world should take up arms not only against United States,
but against the United Nations.
[in Arabic] Under no circumstances should any Muslim or sane person
resort to the United Nations.
[in English] And the grounds for that appeal
was that the United Nations had helped dismember Indonesia,
the largest Muslim country in the world,
and that it had pried away, uh, East Timor from this Muslim motherland, Indonesia,
and bin Laden was sending the signal the UN is a target.
It's not an unusual thing for the United Nations to be, uh, targeted
when our objective in that country, I think,
which should be recognized by all,
is to just help Iraqis get back on their feet.
[reporter] A Special Representative of the UN, Sérgio de Mello,
was there in the compound when this truck bomb detonated
right below his window.
We still don't have any conformation about the extent of the injuries.
We're still searching out more information about that. We are...
[Valentine] I told ranking officers,
I'd said, "Get me the heavy equipment, bull dozers, cranes...
Just find me anything."
[William] Finally, somebody threw down a woman's purse,
and it was tied with a string
which looked like the kind of cord that you use on a set of drapes,
that they had tied together and that became what we used to haul the bricks up.
So I'd fill it with a half a dozen bricks
and these guys would haul it up to the third floor,
throw it somewhere and they'd drop it back down
and we'd throw a few more bricks in.
And this just kept going on and on.
That went on for hours until there was enough room
for me to move Gil or Sérgio a little bit out of the way.
Sérgio did move a little bit,
but every time I moved him, he was in agony,
and every time I moved him, the dirt and the walls were shifting.
So I really had no means of supporting the walls up,
because I didn't have two by fours, or four by fours or anything like that.
But this stuff didn't come fast enough.
[William] There was no unity in command, no unity of effort.
Basically, you know, fire service in America, Canada, Western Europe
they're going to have shoring equipment, they're gonna have things that we can use
to stabilize the building to get them out. We had nothing but our hands,
a ladies purse and a string.
At the base of the rubble pile, there were a couple of people milling around.
One was a female.
She was missing a shoe. She had torn dress.
I don't know what language she was speaking, to be quite honest with you,
but it wasn't English.
She was told a number of occasions to go to the casualty collection point,
but she kept milling around.
[Larriera] I tell the soldiers, "Come on, you know, help me. Let's get him out.
Let's get some shovels and start digging the debris out."
And he tells me, "There are no shovels."
"Well, okay, let's do it, you know, with this piece of steel."
He said, "No, no, no. We need to wait for equipment to come."
"But where is equipment?
Who the hell is in charge?"
[Rice] I got a phone call saying that, uh,
Sérgio de Mello had perhaps been very seriously wounded.
That he was trapped and that they didn't know how serious the situation was.
But then a few minutes later,
someone said, "Well, no, he'd been speaking,
and had been talking to people outside the building."
And I remember just a sense of relief that, uh, perhaps this was all right.
[Bremer] The President called and he said, "Well, please find out what happened."
And my Chief of Staff pulled me aside and he said,
"We don't know what's happened with Sérgio."
Um, "The last we heard he was alive,
but, you know, we just don't know what's going on.
Um, he's trapped somewhere in the rubble."
Short time ago I spoke with Ambassador Bremer,
directed him to provide all possible assistance
to the rescue and recovery effort
at the United Nations headquarters.
[man] Heads up.
You ask questions or you want to hear from me?
-[reporter] Both. -Yeah?
[Rice] The President immediately took to him.
He was eloquent.
He was committed.
He drew you in in the conversation with him.
You just knew that this was somebody who could command a room.
Secretary General,
distinguished members of the Council,
friends,
I believe we have reason to be optimistic
about the future of Iraq.
But we have little margin for error.
[in English] The United Nations' presence in Iraq remains vulnerable to
any who would seek to target our organization.
Our security continues to rely significantly
on the reputation of the United Nations,
our ability to demonstrate meaningfully that we are in Iraq to assist its people
in our independence.
[Power] Sérgio hadn't wanted to go to Iraq in any deep way.
I mean, he liked being at the center of, uh, the action, always.
He liked being the center of attention, always.
But he was beginning to build a new life with Carolina
and exhausted from East Timor,
coupled with the fact that he opposed the war in Iraq, to begin with,
but as soon as the question was posed, Sérgio did not feel like he could say no,
and of course tried to make the best of, uh, not an ideal situation.
[McNamara] I never forget him writing his speech for his landing in Baghdad.
I think he didn't have the press that he expected
because Bremer had called a press conference for his own at the same time,
so that sort of sabotaged a little bit,
but he was pretty aware of a historic event,
and I think also pretty aware
that he had an awful mandate from the Security Council.
It wasn't a political management mission.
It wasn't a humanitarian mission.
It was a compromised mission under the US occupation.
But if anyone could have achieved something
in that political hotchpotch mess of a situation,
it would've been Sérgio.
Hi.
[Rishmawi] The first thing he wanted to do is to listen.
He went to Basra, Mosul, Erbil, all over. All over.
He was very attentive to how normal Iraqis were living day by day.
Water, electricity.
He saw it very much as a question of human dignity.
What I do if I don't have money? What I do?
I stole. Became a thief.
-No, don't do that. I understand-- -No, I am...
I am a graduate from a university.
[Salamé] Well, he didn't know much, but he did not pretend to know much.
That was something that you'd immediately like about him that...
he was willing to listen, to learn.
We had an advantage.
Everybody is in principle willing to talk to us,
which was not the case with the Americans.
[Sérgio] I am here to listen to you.
I am here to learn.
[Sérgio] Tell me frankly, how you believe the United Nations, myself,
and my colleagues can be helpful to you.
[Larriera] Sérgio worked non-stop.
He was eternally optimistic that, uh,
he and his team, single-handedly, and perhaps naively, um,
could turn the tables around.
[Bremer] We've had a very good first meeting with Mr. de Mello here,
going over a very wide range of issues on which we can work together
to help in our common objective which is producing an independent, democratic
peaceful Iraq, and I think we have a very good sense...
Sérgio saw nothing incompatible with trying to help the UN
by helping the Iraqis, which in turn would help the United States.
There wasn't any press briefing foreseen in our program.
[Holbrooke] He was not an accomplice
to the terrible mistakes of the Bush administration.
He was doing what he could for the Iraqi people
in a typical Sérgio fashion.
He was paying too little attention to the fact
that he was at great personal risk
precisely because the more effective he was
the more he would be perceived by the enemies of the US
as serving American interests.
[reporter] Mr. de Mello,
is there a real role to the United Nations
in the political process in Iraq
or it's just a cover to the American...
American occupation?
Thank you. First of all, my friend, and answering your second question,
the UN, its Secretary General,
and Sérgio Vieira de Mello, Representative of the Secretary General,
are no tool and no cover for anyone, all right?
We are an independent organization.
Secretary General Kofi Annan and myself are independent from anyone.
So don't suggest for a second that we are there supporting the United States
or the coalition, all right?
Once in the street, there were small pieces of paper in blue.
Like, square ones in blue,
uh, that says "Al-Qaeda is now here," or something like that.
Someone had been reportedly seen taking down the numbers of the license plates
of cars coming in and out of the compound.
[William] As an anti-terrorism specialist,
I try to look at it from the terrorist point of view and I was thinking that,
you know, "If I was a terrorist,
it would be so easy to drive a truck loaded with explosives down the driveway
and detonate it right next to the UN and blow it up."
I recommended strongly that they put in a large reinforced gate
at the entrance to the Canal road driveway,
but it was a very busy road and they were concerned the traffic
trying to get into the parking lot would queue up,
and they'd have accidents and it would just be a mess and...
I reported back that I thought, you know,
it'd be better to have a few fender-bender accidents
than have somebody drive a truck up the driveway and blow up the building.
In lieu of the gate that I'd recommended,
the 2nd Cavalry had supplied them
with a Bradley armored fighting vehicle and a crew,
and they were basically the valet parking.
Later on, I noticed the vehicle was gone
and there was nothing there except a roll of concertina wire across the driveway,
and I was, like, "Uh-oh."
When I spoke to somebody at the UN, I said "What happened to it?"
And they said, "Oh, Sérgio ordered it moved." I'm, like, "Oh, Jesus."
He was trying to tone down the American presence at the UN compound,
so it didn't look like the UN was, you know, part of the coalition forces.
The UN is ruled by the Jews and the Americans
and its crimes are flagrant in the Arab and Islamic world.
Zarqawi told me he needed to hit a big target - to recruit followers.
Zarqawi said that the UN
was a nest for secret services and American spies.
He said he needed to attack the UN
and kill that criminal Sérgio.
On that Monday, he told me that he...
he really needed something to look on to the future.
We needed to get going and start planning immediately
on our next steps, on our next move.
And really our next move had been to go back to Brazil.
Monday night he said, "Carolina, let's book the flights
and make sure that we have a clear exit strategy.
Because I need to be thinking that I'm going back to Brazil,
I'm going back to Rio."
We were six weeks away from leaving Baghdad.
[William] They say time flies when you're having fun.
Well, I certainly wasn't having fun but time was flying.
And the golden hour, it came and went, we didn't even realize it.
I'm tired, my legs and arms were cramping.
We were driven, basically.
We were determined that these guys were not gonna die in this hole.
I tried to get them into their, what I felt was their religious belief.
[William] At one point Andre wanted to pray with Sérgio
and he was still lucid enough to say if prayers...
You know, this is not the time,
uh, which I think kind of [chuckles] upset Andre a little bit.
I asked him, you know, you got to have faith, you have to believe,
and he said, "Believe? Damn, God. God did this to me," you know.
"Curse God." He was using some other words that I will not say,
um, and I was trying to tell him, "God didn't do this to you, man.
You have to have faith this strong
to believe that God could get you out of here.
I'm you savior, in a sense.
You have to believe in me."
I've never had that experience.
In 35 years, nobody's ever said, "Hey, let's stop and pray."
What's so wrong with praying with somebody, you know?
It, it, uh... It wouldn't have hurt.
And Sérgio wanted no part of that, so, you know...
And he was... [chuckles]
expletive deleted "no," you know. He didn't want any part of that.
I'm not a big prayer guy either. I was, like, I don't know if I...
tactfully or untactfully said, "We haven't got time for this shit.
Prayer's great, we'll pray when we get him out. But let's get him out."
[Larriera] There are some soldiers that told me to clear the area.
I said, "No, no, no, I'm going there because I hear that Sérgio's there."
And the soldier comes to me and says,
"No, you know, you have to clear the area. You have to step back."
And I said, "No, no."
After a period of time I started to figure out that
maybe there was something going on between her and somebody in there.
She was close with him or something, I don't know.
I could see she wanted to get up,
and I though about it for a second and I said, "You know what?
Let them talk to each other."
I gave her my hand, I let her come up,
she put her head on the hole and started talking.
I put my ear and my mouth very close to the hole
and I, I say...
Sérgio, are you there?
And a very weak voice says, "Carolina, my love, I'm in pain, I'm here.
I love you."
And I tell him I love him too...
to be strong...
and I'm going to get him out.
At this point, Gil is reacting to some verbal stimuli, but not much.
You can't get really more than a word or two in reply.
We got to get him out, we know we got to get him out,
we got to get him out now.
But the problem is he's still pinned from his lower legs.
Where Sérgio was, Gil had to be removed first.
I said, "Buddy, you know, I've done the best I can,
and if I don't get you out now, we're never gonna get out."
So he said, "Do what you have to do,
and I just wanna live and I wanna go home."
My memory of it is that, you know, I'm just not going to give in.
I'm not going to die. I have...
a lot to live for, you know. I...
You know, I thought...
[voice breaking] immediately of my family.
A decision was made and, uh, we all agreed on it,
and the most important thing was Gil was ready for it.
The only thing they found me was an old rusty wood saw
and my trusty paramedic scissors.
I said, "I'm gonna start sawing away.
If you have to scream out, scream out.
If the pain is unbearable, let me know and I will stop
and give you some more pain medicine."
I don't remember any of that. I've... blacked that out.
[Valentine] I started to cut through his first leg.
I had to kind of separate his screaming from what I had to do,
'cause I knew it had to be done.
Even with morphine, even being deeply in shock
and basically reacting only to pain,
it was pretty gruesome work. Um...
He screamed. I mean, you probably could've heard the screams in, you know,
the green zone.
We felt terrible, but we knew if we didn't do this,
he would die where he was, because we physically couldn't get him out.
I pulled tighter on the tourniquet,
and I told him I'm gonna go to the second leg.
He didn't answer for a while, for a few minutes, I thought I'd lost him.
What I believe what happened was,
the pain was so bad that it literally just knocked him out.
So, in a way, that was probably a blessing.
I started to cut into the second leg and he woke up again,
and he started to moan and he just said, "Andre, I feel that,
but go ahead and do it and finish."
Um, and I did. I finished cutting the second leg,
pulled tighter on the tourniquet, and I bandaged it.
[William] We finally got a Sked.
It's an acronym for something and I have no idea what it is,
but it's this plastic roll-up thing
that when you unroll it and lace the sides
it forms a semi-rigid stretcher.
[Valentine] I got him in the best I can,
and the team up on top was just waiting on me to say go ahead and go.
They pulled, and they pulled, and they pulled.
The reinforcing rod was blocking one part of the small opening
and the body was blocking the other.
We tried to pull the SKD past it, it wouldn't fit.
Since we never got the hacksaw, we couldn't move the reinforcing rod.
So the only other way to get Gil up was to
remove the body that was pinned in the rubble part way up.
So I had the unenviable task of, uh, using my combat knife again to, uh,
cut the body in half so they could haul it.
[exhales] And if you think cutting a leg off was fun...
Uh, now even though the victim was dead and obviously deceased...
it was still hard work.
[Valentine] And they finally got Gil up.
I looked at him and I said, "Gil, you're free, you're home now.
I'm gonna give you to my other guys and they will take you to the doctors."
[Loescher] My family was my anchor.
I probably knew instinctively that if I got out of there...
that they would, uh...
[sighs] see me through my recovery.
He was close to death when they got him out there.
His vital signs were, like, 60 over 40 for blood pressure,
uh, and they did a hot load
into one of the medivac helicopters and flew him away.
I spotted this man. I rushed to him and I asked him,
"Please, I need your help. I need your help.
My Sérgio is in the rubble, and he is going to die if...
if we don't help him out."
He told me, "I have news for you.
Do you see that helicopter, the black copter that just left off?"
And I said, "Yes, yes."
"That is passing by now? That's probably...
the helicopter with him. But I have bad news for you,
and you have to be strong.
To free him out we had to cut his legs
and he is in a very bad shape.
One of his arms is also in very bad shape."
I said, "Okay, it doesn't matter. Is he alive?
I don't care about his legs, is he alive?"
"Yes."
[Valentine] His mind was starting to go. He wasn't talking much anymore.
He was... You could hear his breathing was a lot more erratic
and, and, uh, irregular and stuff,
and I just went over there and I continued to encourage him,
I tried to, uh, hold his hand,
and you know, lay next to him and put my head on him,
uh, so he'll know that somebody was there.
I went back over to talk to Sérgio, tell him we'll get you out next,
he didn't reply to me. Shook him, he didn't reply to me.
Felt for a pulse, and there wasn't one.
We weren't gonna get him out, and that kind of hit me like a ton of bricks.
[Larriera] I, I felt there is something wrong. I know there was something wrong.
I hear on the back...
someone saying Sérgio's dead.
Sérgio's dead. [sobs]
No.
No.
[softly] I wanted to die.
He failed me. He really failed me.
I really believe God sent two miracles.
Bill and myself, we were his angels,
and he failed both of us.
And it hurt real bad.
I'm mad at him, but I'm also hurt for him,
because he didn't believe in me. He didn't believe in a miracle.
We only asked him to stay alive, have the will to survive,
have the faith to survive and he didn't want to.
Maybe he's misconstruing where he's saying...
you know, basically don't worry about me, get everybody else out first.
Maybe he's construing that as not a will to live.
I look at that as being pretty selfless.
I don't think that's a lack of will to live, I think that's, you know,
I think that's a pretty damn good thing.
I told him, "I promise I'm gonna get you out." And I didn't.
I felt almost, like, he knew I lied to him.
To this day, it's probably the thing that bothers me the most is that
I truly felt that I'd get both of these guys out alive.
[Bremer] A soldier covered with sweat and dirt came over and he said,
Mr. Ambassador, I'm very sorry, we tried to save Sérgio,
but he's dead.
Now the press were clamoring for an interview.
I could not say that I knew Sérgio was dead because
I couldn't have his family find out by my making a statement on television,
so I basically lied.
[reporter] Excuse me, sir.
Sérgio Vieira de Mello apparently also has been injured in this attack...
Yes, that's right. As of this time,
my dear friend Sérgio is somewhere back there.
Uh, it may well be that he was the target of this attack.
The truck was parked in such a place, here in front of the building
that it had to affect his office which was in the second floor above us.
What strikes me about the rescue is just the utter indignity
of Sérgio being left under the rubble for three and a half hours,
for them to be relying upon a lady's handbag and a curtain rope?
Are we kidding?
This is the United States.
And the degree to which the political planners of this war failed
not only Sérgio and the UN officials and others who were killed that day,
but also their own soldiers who put their lives on the line in that way.
Terrible. Terrible.
[Davie] He was lying on his flag, in the rubble.
The United Nations flag.
The, uh, the team...
above then, uh, pulled...
and, uh, slowly we were able to take him up, uh,
up the shaft.
Gaby was up there and some of his other, uh, bodyguards, and, uh, and they...
took one of the stretchers and, uh,
and laid him on... Sorry.
We put him on a stretcher.
We looked at him and we thought, "Everything he did in the world...
for this."
Impossible to understand.
[in English] We were standing up there in the second floor and the body came,
and, uh, it was put on a...
[exhales deeply] on a...
Uh, and I recognized him. His face was...
entirely intact.
And he looked handsome as usual, I remember.
I received a call
that he had died.
I felt like crying, screaming
but my Grandmother was here
and she didn't know.
She didn't know anything.
So I controlled myself as much as possible,
went to the bedroom and cried for a bit
then pulled my head together and took care of it.
That was when my world collapsed inside my head.
[voice breaking] To have a son like that
with such good qualities
and it ends like that.
I miss him immensely.
Now, I can't say I've come out of the tunnel,
but I'm walking.
And often I go to the Cemetery of Kings
where Sérgio's body is buried
and I talk to him.
Now he's up in there in the sky
and certainly still trying to save some people up there.
I know one day I'll meet him again.
But I really can't forgive the people who did this to him.
[in English] I was really impressed with his stoicism.
Never asked about himself, he asked about others, you know.
Never asked for anything for himself in the way of pain medicine.
He was always asking, "Take care of the others,"
and I thought somebody should know that.
I didn't know who to contact, I didn't know where he was from.
I just knew his boss was Kofi Annan.
So that night on my broken and battered laptop computer,
I wrote a letter to Kofi Annan.
19th August, 2003.
[sniffles] You know, I'm not gonna get through this.
"Subject: Sérgio Vieira de Mello.
As you are painfully aware, at approximately 1630 today local time,
a horrible disaster occurred
[voice breaks] at the UN headquarters in Baghdad.
I was the first US soldier to arrive on the scene, and the sight was catastrophic.
Unfortunately, Mr. de Mello passed away.
While there is no good way to die, it says a lot about a man's character
when his last thoughts are for his family, his co-workers,
and his country, or in this case, the UN.
I'm truly sorry we could not
have kept our promise to get him out alive.
The UN is fortunate to have people of this caliber working for them.
I salute all of them
and hope that your mission in Iraq will conclude successfully.
Mr. de Mello was a humanitarian of the first order.
He will be hard to be replaced."
[Kofi Annan] Today we share our shock and sorrow
at the loss of people we loved.
All of them leave a huge void.
Raid, Leen, Ihsan, Emaad, and Basim,
Rahim, Ranillo, Rick, Reza,
Jean-Sélim, Christopher, Martha,
Fiona, Nadia,
finally, Sérgio, my dear friend.
Why did you never seem tired
while even working 18-hour days?
Why did you never look crumpled
even after an 18-hour flight?
Why were you never sick?
Why were you never grumpy?
And you were the only top official in the UN known to everyone
by his first name.
Even to those who didn't know you personally
you were always just Sérgio.
[Power] It is heartening that around the world,
whether in the United Nations missions
or in humanitarian organizations or in governments,
you do have individuals who ask themselves
what would Sérgio do.
The one answer that they know he would give is,
"Get out of the capital and go out into the world
and figure out what's happening.
Figure out what's making people tick.
Respect the dignity of the human beings whose lives are at stake here.
Don't treat them as a model if there is a mass.
Engage the bad guys.
Be a man of action,
but also never stop being a man of reflection."
[Larriera] I wish I could have an elastic time.
To be able to go back to the past and stretch out some special moments
to a maximum.
Now we know where that, uh, those times are finished and, uh...
and... they won't happen again.
When I finally made it back to Brazil, I went to this spot.
The spot where we will always arrive
every time we would hit the ground in Brazil,
and go straight into the water at the sea.
I really felt the strength of his spirit and the kindness of his spirit
were right there.
That's where I feel that... that Sérgio is now.
And where I feel that, uh, he really, really rests forever.
[Sérgio] My message is very simple.
Never forget that the real challenges
and the real rewards of serving the United Nations
are out there in the field,
where people are suffering, where people need you.
So, good luck. Welcome to the organization,
and here we are to help you in any way we can.
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder.
Which, as they kiss, consume."
Gran?
Edward, don't, she'll see you.
Okay.
Gran, I'd like you to meet--
Happy birthday, Bella.
Happy birthday.
I thought we agreed no presents.
Well, the one from me's not wrapped. So it doesn't count.
That's actually great. Thanks, Dad.
Uh, it goes with this one from your mom. We coordinated. Well, she coordinated me.
We coordinated. Well, she coordinated me.
It's to, uh, put your pictures in from senior year.
Senior year.
How'd you get so old so fast? I didn't. -It's not that old. -I don't know.
-It's not that old. -I don't know. Is that a gray hair?
No. No way.
Happy birthday.
That's really funny.
[man on radio] Another missing hiker brings the total to three presumed dead.
Rangers are searching for the killer animal--
[Eric] It's Bella. Bella.
-Hi. -Hi.
[Jessica] Today's the big day, Bella.
Uh, R and J essay due?
Oh, yeah.
Wherefore art thou, Bella?
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom wants me to put together, like, a big scrapbook full of memories.
-Oh, cool, yeah. -I take 'em, I'm not in 'em, so…
No, no, no. Come here.
You'll Photoshop this if my nose looks big, right?
[Eric] Don't worry, I'm in the picture. No one will be looking at you guys.
[Bella] It's good.
-[Eric] Oh, good. -[Mike] Cullen's here.
Well, talk to you later.
-[Edward] Happy birthday. -Don't remind me. [Edward] Mmm.
Bell, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
Yeah, but my aging is not. Your aging?
I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that.
-It's one year older than you. -No, it isn't.
I'm 109.
[Bella] Wow. Maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man.
-Mmm. -It's gross. -[Bella] I should be thoroughly repulsed. -Mmm.
We have to go to class. Okay.
Wait a second.
Someone wants you.
[Jacob] Bella.
Jacob.
I'll leave you to talk.
[Bella] Hello, biceps.
You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you. [Jacob chuckles] Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.
[Jacob chuckles] Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
You should switch schools. You can come hang out with the palefaces.
I'm all right. I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.
They let any old riff-raff into this place.
I see. Then why are you slummin' it?
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.
You should really come take a ride when it's done.
Is it fast?
Um… it's decent. -[both laugh] -[Bella] I'm kidding.
Okay. Good.
-[Jacob] Hey. -[Bella clears throat] Happy birthday.
[Jacob] Your dad told my dad, so…
Yeah, of course he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
It catches bad dreams.
That's kind of perfect. Um…
Thank you.
No problem.
-Good seeing you. -Yeah, I'll see you later.
So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
'Cause I have nothing to give back to you.
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.
[Bella] See, thank you.
-That's all I want. -[Alice] Bella.
-Happy birthday. -Shh, shh!
[scoffs] I thought I said no presents.
I've already seen you open it, and guess what?
-You love it. -[laughs]
You're gonna wear it tonight. Our place.
Come on, please?
[Alice] It'll be fun.
Okay. All right. [giggles] Great! Okay, I'll see you at seven.
[giggles] Great! Okay, I'll see you at seven.
Jasper. No fair with the mood control thing.
Sorry, Bella.
Happy…
Never mind.
Can't trust vampires. Trust me.
[man on TV] O, my love. My wife!
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,
but hath no power yet upon thy beauty.
[Bella] I hate being celebrated.
[Edward] There are worse tragedies. Look at Romeo.
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.
[Bella clicks tongue] Yeah.
But I do envy him one thing.
[Bella] Juliet is, like, perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
Not the girl, the, uh… the suicide.
It's nearly impossible for, uh…
for some… people. [scoffs]
For humans, a little poison.
A dagger to the heart.
There's so many different options.
Why would you say that?
'Cause I had to consider it once.
[Edward] I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of… plan.
What was the plan?
Go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.
-The what? -The Volturi.
[teacher] Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter
just to show they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen.
Uh, yes, Mr. Berty, um…
"O here, will I set up my everlasting rest…
…and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
Eyes look your last.
Arms take your last embrace.
And lips, O you, the doors of breath,
seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death."
Eyes on the screen, people.
[man on TV] Thus with a kiss, I die.
[Edward] The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.
Is that Carlisle? Yeah.
He lived with them for a few decades.
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course, but respect for the arts and the sciences, at least.
but respect for the arts and the sciences, at least.
And the law.
Above all, the law.
[Bella] Vampires have laws?
[Edward] Not very many.
And only one that's regularly enforced.
[Bella] What is it?
[Edward] That we keep the existence of our kind a secret.
We don't make spectacles of ourselves.
And we don't kill conspicuously.
Unless, of course, you want to die.
You gotta stop talking about that.
I can't even think… about someone hurting you.
Bella. The only thing that can hurt me is you.
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
[clicks tongue] That's not true.
Victoria. She'll come for me one day.
Alice will see when she decides, and… And we'll be ready.
I could protect you.
If you change me.
Bella. You already do protect me.
You're my only reason…
to stay alive, if that's what I am.
But it's my job to protect you.
From everyone except my sister.
[Alice] It's time.
It's time, it's time, it's time.
Sorry about all this. We tried to rein Alice in.
Sorry about all this. We tried to rein Alice in. As if that were even possible. Happy birthday, Bella.
As if that were even possible. Happy birthday, Bella. -Thanks. -[camera shutter clicks]
I… found it in your bag. Mind?
Dating an older woman. Hot.
-[chuckles] -What? [Alice] You first, Rosalie.
It's a necklace. Alice picked it out.
Thanks.
Show me the love.
This one's from Emmett.
Already installed it in your truck.
Finally a decent sound system for that piece of--
Hey, don't… don't hate the truck.
[Alice laughs] Open Esme and Carlisle's.
[Carlisle] Just a little something to brighten your day.
Yes, you've been looking kind of pale lately.
[sucks teeth] Paper cut.
-[Jasper panting] -Jaz, Jaz, shh, shh. It's okay. It's just a little…
…blood.
[Carlisle] Get Jasper out of here.
I'm… I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
Check on Jasper.
[Carlisle] I'm sure he's very upset with himself,
and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward.
[Bella] I never wanted to have a party.
[Carlisle] It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
How do you do it?
Years and years of practice.
[Bella] Did you ever think of… just doing it the easy way?
No.
-I knew who I wanted to be. -[tool clinks] I wanted to help people.
-Brings me happiness. -[snips] -Even if I am damned, regardless. -[scissors clink]
Damned?
Like… like Hell? [scoffs]
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.
-You couldn't. It's impossible. -[clicks tongue]
Thank you, Bella.
You've always been very… gracious about us.
So that's it. That's why he won't change me?
Imagine the situation in reverse, hmm?
If you believed as Edward does,
could you take away his soul?
You can't protect me.
From everything.
At some point, something's gonna separate us.
It's gonna be an accident or illness,
or old age.
As long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.
That's not a solution, that's a tragedy.
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother. -[keys clinking] -[door opens]
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all?
Carlisle told me.
How you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
So don't worry about mine.
You should go inside.
It's still my birthday.
So can I ask one thing?
Kiss me.
I love you.
I love you.
Hey.
Come and take a walk with me. ♪ Folds in her gown ♪
We have to leave Forks.
Why?
Carlisle is supposed to be ten years older than he looks,
and people are starting to notice.
Okay, I… [sighs] I've got to think of something to say to Charlie.
When you say "we"…
I mean my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper… It's nothing.
You're right. It was nothing.
Nothing but what I always expected.
And nothing compared to what could have happened.
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
[Edward] No, you don't.
I'm coming.
Bella.
I don't want you to come.
You don't want me.
No.
That changes things. A lot. [exhales deeply]
But if it's not too much to ask,
can you just promise me something?
Don't do anything reckless.
For Charlie's sake.
And I'll promise something to you in return.
This is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back.
And you can go on with your life without any interference from me.
It'll be like… I never existed, I promise.
If this is about my soul, take it. I don't want it without you.
It's not about your soul.
You're just not good for me.
Not good enough for you. [breathes shakily]
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.
Please.
Don't. [breathes heavily]
Goodbye.
Edward.
Edward.
Edward.
Edward!
[sobbing] Edward.
I'm going to try the Cullens' place again.
The Cullens left town, Charlie. Good riddance.
Where'd they go?
We'll find her, Charlie.
Thanks, Harry. [Jacob] Charlie.
She's all right.
I got her. Thank you, Sam.
♪ There's a possibility ♪ ♪ All that I had ♪
[Bella] Alice. You've disappeared.
Like everything else.
Who else can I talk to? I'm lost.
♪ There's a possibility ♪
When you left… ♪ There's a possibility ♪
…and he left,
…you took everything with you.
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
Bella.
[Bella] But in a way, I'm glad.
The pain is my only reminder that he was real.
That you all were.
All right, that's it.
What?
You're going to Jacksonville. Live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
Bells… He's not coming back.
I know.
It's just not normal, this behavior.
[Charlie] Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me and your mother.
Baby, I… I don't want you to leave.
I don't, but just go. Go to Jacksonville. -Make some new friends. -I like my old friends.
-Make some new friends. -I like my old friends.
[Charlie] Well, you never see 'em anymore. I do, I…
I'm… [sighs] …gonna, uh, go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.
You hate shopping. I… [sighs]
…need a girls night out.
All right. Girls night.
Shopping.
I like it. Go. Buy some stuff.
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.
Uh, yeah, Bella Swan.
[Jessica] I don't know why you want to sit through
all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross, like… Why are there that many zombie movies anyway?
If it's supposed to, like, draw a parallel about leprosy,
my cousin had leprosy. It's not funny, you know.
And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism,
'cause don't be so pleased with your own, like,
self-reverential cleverness, you know.
Like, some girls like to shop. Not all girls, apparently.
Though I was surprised you even called at all, you know?
Like, your depression thing, I get it.
I'm totally, totally worried. But after a while, it's like,
-you're still bumming? -[man] Want a ride, girls?
And I'm going through stuff too.
-[man] What's up? -[Jessica chatter indistinctly]
[Jessica] It's hard, you know, like…
-What's up, guys? -[indistinct chatter]
Where are you going?
-Keep walking. -[gasps]
This is dangerous.
Dude, come on.
-[man] Come here for a sec. -[Jessica scoffs]
I think I know those guys.
[man] We got beer. We got bikes.
Well, they seem great. Can we go?
I'm just gonna see something.
[man] Hey, girlie!
All right, all right, we got a taker.
-Turn around. -♪ All my life I've been searching♪
[man] Shut up.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
No, that's cool. I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.
So, what do you say?
You promised me nothing reckless.
You promised it would be as if you never existed.
You lied. Did you say something, babe? You know what, never mind.
Did you say something, babe? You know what, never mind.
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!
[Jessica] Hey, um, what the hell's wrong with you?
Just curious?
I thought that I saw something. You… oh.
You're insane, actually, or suicidal.
That homeboy could have been a psycho.
I was about to end up in an FBI interview room like some lame TV show.
God, that was such a rush.
Awesome, so you're an adrenaline junkie now?
That's cool, you can go bungee jumping.
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle.
Crazy!
[Bella] Alice. I saw him.
Maybe I'm crazy now. I guess that's okay.
If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him,
then that's what I'll find.
Bella.
Where the hell have you been, loca?
[sighs] I, uh, brought you something.
[Jacob] Okay. It's a little crazy.
Wow. Scrap metal.
Wow. Scrap metal. -You shouldn't have. -I saved it from the junkyard.
-You shouldn't have. -I saved it from the junkyard.
I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth.
But then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend
- to help me out, then… - Ah, me.
- to help me out, then… - Ah, me. Being the mechanic-type friend? [Bella] That's right.
Since when are you into motorcycles? Since now.
I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, I mean it's completely stupid and reckless.
When do we start?
Now. [chuckles]
Please. All right.
Oh, wait, be careful. Those things are actually really heavy, so…
Jake, you're, like, buff. How did that happen?
Jake, you're, like, buff. How did that happen? You're, like, 16. I don't get it. [chuckles] Age is just a number, baby.
[chuckles] Age is just a number, baby. What are you, like, 40 now?
-♪ I may never ever find a cure ♪ -Feels like that sometimes.
That song's good. You don't like it?
Um, I don't really like… …music anymore, kind of.
Okay. No more music.
So, I was thinking, if we're going to do this every day,
and hopefully we will,
we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
You, influence me? Please.
Are you… I'm older than you, so…
I'm older than you, so… …that makes me the influencer, and you the influencee.
[laughing] No, no, no.
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you,
because of your general paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me.
Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naive?
Okay, so where do we stand?
I'm 35. -And you might be, like, 32. -[knock at door] -Come on. -[door opens]
[man] Yo, Jake, you in there? No, it's ok, it's just my boys.
-Hey, Jake. -Hey, guys, this is Bella.
-Hey. -Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
I'm Quil Ateara.
So the bike-building story's true.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I taught him everything he knows.
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?
Uh, we're friends, you know.
-Ooh, burn. -[laughs] Actually, remember I said she's a girl and a friend.
Actually, remember I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope.
So you guys have girlfriends. That's awesome.
Yeah, right. Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.
-[laughs] -Yeah, that's still a riot.
You want funny, Black? I'll give you funny.
[Jacob] Yeah, that hold's illegal!
[Embry] I got five bucks on Quil.
You're on.
[Bella] Dear Alice, I wish I had your real address.
I wish I could tell you about Jake.
He makes me feel better.
I mean, he makes me feel alive.
The hole in my chest.
Well, when I'm with Jake, it's… …it's like it's almost healed.
For a while.
[Jacob] So, Quil keeps asking to come over. I think he likes you a little too much.
Well, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing, you know?
What's up with you and age?
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy anyway?
[Bella] But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.
-[door opens] -Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Bella, Bella. [shushing]
-[panting] -You're okay. You're okay.
Well, I thought this thing was starting to work, but… I guess not.
Can I ask you something?
Hanging out with Jacob.
That seems to take your mind off things a bit, doesn't it?
You know, sometimes…
…you gotta learn to love what's good for you.
You know what I mean?
Of course, what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.
Famous ladies' man.
Okay.
Go to bed.
I love you.
If I told you I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you have said?
Are you doubting your mad skills?
No. Definitely not. I mean, they'll run fine.
It's just, uh…
Maybe if I was smart, I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes,
I would say that that's really too bad,
but that we're just gonna have to find something else to do.
Is that Sam Uley?
-[distant shouting] -[Jacob] Yeah. Him and his cult.
Oh, my God.
Did you see that?
They're not really fighting, Bella. They're cliff diving.
Scary as hell, but a total rush.
A rush? [Jacob] Most of us jump from lower down.
We leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
You have some kind of beef with him or something?
I don't know.
[Jacob] They just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.
-Now look at him. -[Bella] That's Embry?
-Yeah. -What happened to him?
He missed some school.
Now, all of a sudden, he started following Sam around like a little puppy.
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.
Sam keeps giving me this look.
Like he's waiting for me or something.
It's kind of starting to freak me out.
Well, you should just avoid him.
I try.
Okay.
-You look scared. -I'm not.
All right.
-[Jacob] Brake? -[Bella] That one.
Clutch? Good.
Gas.
[Jacob] Ready?
-[gasps] -Now slowly release the clutch.
[Edward] Bella.
Stop.
[Jacob] You all right?
I'm gonna go again.
-[awkward chuckle] -[engine starts]
Hit the brake!
-I want to go again. -Are you trying to get yourself killed?
-I want to go again. -No, forget it.
No more bikes.
[Jacob] Man, your head.
-Yeah. -Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?
Yeah, I guess I am.
Well, it's just blood, Bella. No big deal.
[Jacob] Here.
What are you staring at?
-You're sort of beautiful. -[Jacob chuckles]
How hard did you hit your head?
-I don't know. -[chuckling]
[Jacob] Let's go.
[Angela] I did see something in the woods.
Totally. Baby, I believe you.
No, he doesn't. He's just trying to get lucky.
[Angela] No. It was jet black and huge.
On all fours, it was still taller than a person.
A bear, maybe?
Or an alien. You're lucky you didn't get probed. -[Eric laughs] -Oh, yeah.
[Angela] Well, I saw it.
[Bella] You know you're not the only one.
Um, my dad's been getting reports at the station.
Like, five hikers have been killed by some bear,
but they can't find the bear.
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
So, I mean…
…Bella's back.
Yeah, I guess so.
All right, that's… Well, welcome.
Um, so listen, you know, now that, you know, you're talking and, uh…
eating again, which, you know, gotta get that protein in there.
I was just wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me.
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I do.
Cool, um… Let me see, we could check out, um…
[clicks tongue] Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.
You know, it's a dumb title, but, um, it's a romantic comedy.
-I mean, it's supposed to be… -No. No romance.
How about Face Punch? Have you heard of that?
[stammers] I mean, that's an action movie.
Yeah, it's perfect.
Um, guns, adrenaline.
It's my thing.
Okay.
We should get a bunch of people to go. Do you guys want to go see… -Face Punch? -[Eric] Face Punch, yeah.
-Face Punch? -[Eric] Face Punch, yeah.
Mike, hey. We were supposed to watch that.
Remember, the trailer's like… [imitates explosion]
-Yeah? -Punch faces…
[Jessica] Yeah. Movie night with Bella. [chuckles awkwardly]
[Jacob] So, Face Punch, huh?
You like action movies?
Not really.
I heard it sucks. Bad.
You know, are you even old enough to see this movie?
I mean, you know, without, like, adult supervision?
Right, yeah. Well, she's buying my ticket for me.
Buying it, okay.
Jessica bailed, and Angela got the stomach flu,
so Eric's taking care of her.
-It's just us three. -Great.
-Great. -[Jacob] Yeah.
-[gun cocks in movie] -[man 1] Put your gun down.
[man 2] Put her gun down, or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.
[man 3] Both of you put both of your guns down,
or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off.
[man 1] All right, forget it. Let's do this! -[gunfire] -[shouting]
Okay, I… I think I'm gonna throw up. [groans]
He's…
What a marshmallow.
You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.
Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah, I'll keep my eye open for that. -[Jacob chuckles] -Mm.
I feel bad, he probably has that flu that's… going around.
What, I can't hold your hand?
No, of course you can.
I just think it, you know, means something a little different to you, so…
Okay, well, tell me something. You like me, right?
And you think I'm sort of beautiful.
[softly] Jake, please. Don't do this.
Why?
'Cause you're about to ruin everything.
And… I need you.
Well, I've got loads of time.
I'm not gonna give up.
I don't want you to.
But…
It's just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere.
That's really selfish.
You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never gonna run right, so I should be fair to you.
It's because of him, right?
Look…
I know what he did to you.
And Bella, I would never, ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you. I promise.
I won't let you down.
You can count on me.
Well… [sniffing]
I need to go home.
I'm… I was feeling sick before the movie, okay?
What is your problem?
Right now, you're my problem.
Feeling sick? Maybe you need to go to the hospital.
You want me to put you in the hospital?
Jake. Jake, Jake, the movie's over. What are you doing?
You're… really hot.
Like, you feel like you have a fever. Are you okay?
I don't know what's happening.
I gotta go.
-[door closes] -Dude is weird.
[Bella on phone] Jake, your dad says you have mono?
He won't let me visit, but would you call me?
Hey. It's me again, I just…
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater.
I just wanted to hear your voice, so no pressure.
Jacob, please.
-Call me. -[phone clanks]
[Charlie] Okay. We should be back around three.
Hey.
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.
Yes, you do.
Yeah, you do. Go. What are you talking about?
Just be careful.
Always am.
Those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.
My kung fu is strong.
Jake!
Hey!
You cut your hair off?
And got a tattoo?
Bella.
I thought you were too sick to come outside.
Or pick up the phone when I call.
Go away.
What?
Go away.
What happened to you? What's wrong? Hey!
What happened?
Did Sam get to you? Is that what's happening?
No, Sam's trying to help me. Don't blame him.
But if you want somebody to blame,
how about those filthy bloodsuckers you love? The Cullens.
-I don't know what you're talking about. -You know exactly what I'm talking about.
You've been lying to everyone. Charlie.
But you can't lie to me.
-Not anymore, Bella. -[man] Jacob!
Jacob!
Look, Bella…
we can't be friends anymore.
[stammering] Jake, I know that I've been… …hurting you.
It's… it's killing me.
It kills me.
I just need… maybe, give me, like, some time or something--
I just need… maybe, give me, like, some time or something-- Don't.
It's not you.
It's not you, it's me, right? Really?
It's true. It is me.
I'm not… good.
I used to be. A good kid.
Not anymore.
This doesn't even matter, all right?
-This is over. -You can't break up with me.
I mean…
I mean, you're my best friend.
You promised me.
I know.
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.
And this is me keeping that promise.
Go home.
And don't come back. Or you're gonna get hurt.
[Bella] Alice,
things are…
Things are bad again.
Without Jake, I just… I can't stand it.
I don't see Edward anymore.
But I really feel like he never existed.
I will find the place where I can see him again.
Bella.
Laurent.
I didn't expect to find you here.
I went to visit Cullens, but… their house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
Aren't you sort of, um…
a pet of theirs?
Yeah, you could say that.
Do the Cullens visit often?
-Lie. -[gasps]
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.
Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
I probably shouldn't, uh, tell…
I probably shouldn't, uh, tell… Edward. [clears throat]
'Cause he's pretty protective.
But he's far away, isn't he?
Why are you here?
I came as a… favor to Victoria.
Victoria. She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.
She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.
Victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate,
given he killed hers. An eye for an eye.
Threaten him.
Edward would know who did it. And he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
After all, how much could you mean to him
if he left you here unprotected?
Oh, Victoria won't be happy about my killing you.
But I can't help myself. You are so mouthwatering.
Please don't. I mean, you helped us. No, no, no, shh, shh.
Don't be afraid. I'm doing you a kindness.
[whispers] Victoria plans on killing you slowly.
-Painfully. -[breathes heavily]
Whereas I'll make it quick.
I promise.
You will feel nothing.
Edward, I love you.
-[growling] -[Laurent] I don't believe it.
Dad, I saw them. What's the matter?
-In the woods. They're not bears. -What do you mean, in the woods?
Bell, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?
They're wolves. I mean, they're, like, huge wolves.
Are you sure about that, Bella?
Yeah, I just saw them. They were after… something.
-[Harry clears throat] -Wolves?
You saw 'em.
All right. Well… Harry?
Feel like going hunting? Get some of your guys together?
Sure, yeah, I'll, I'll just, uh…
[Bella] By now, those wolves will be dead.
And Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
-[gasps] -Victoria.
I should go to the station.
Dad, you should… you should go.
[Charlie] Can you just stay in the house?
[Jacob whispers] Bella!
Oh, you scared me. What the hell are you doing?
Oh, you scared me. What the hell are you doing? Back up, I'm coming up.
Hey.
[stammers] Look, I'm sorry.
-For what? -I wish I could explain.
But I literally… can't.
Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone?
One that wasn't yours to share?
Well, that's what it's like for me.
But worse.
You have no idea how tight I'm bound.
I hate this.
I hate what they've done to you.
I mean, the killer part is you already know.
Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?
The st--
The story. The story about…
the cold ones.
I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember.
There's gotta be something… -that you can do. -No. I'm in it for life.
-that you can do. -No. I'm in it for life.
Maybe we should just get out of here for awhile.
We'll just leave. Just you and me.
You'd do that?
I would do it for you.
It's not something I can just run away from, Bella.
But I would run away with you.
If I could.
I gotta go. They'll start wondering where I am.
Come here.
[Jacob] Please. Try to remember.
It'd be so much easier if you knew.
I'll try. But, Jake…
Jake, what are you doing? Wait, Jake.
[whispering] Jake.
[Bella] Edward, I'm scared.
[Edward] You should be.
[Jacob] Really, it's just, like, an old story.
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
Bella.
I need to see him.
He's not in.
Look, I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
Bella.
What did you do?
-What did you do? -[man] Hey!
-What did you do to him? -Easy.
-He didn't want this. -What did we do?
-He didn't want this. -What did we do? What did he do, hmm? What'd he tell you?
-Both of you, calm down. -Nothing.
He tells me nothing because he's scared of you.
-Too late now. -[Sam] Bella, get back!
-[Paul growling] -[Sam] Paul! Calm down now.
Bella!
-Run! -[growls]
Jake, run!
[Sam] Paul!
Hey. Take Bella back to Emily's place.
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.
[Bella] Alice, is it possible that everything is true?
The fairy tales and horror stories.
Is it possible that there isn't anything sane and normal at all?
Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him. Serves him right.
No way, Jacob's a natural. You see him phase on the fly?
No way, Jacob's a natural. You see him phase on the fly? [Jared] I got five says Paul doesn't touch him.
Come on in, Bella. We won't bite.
Speak for yourself.
Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fiancée. Don't stare. It bugs Sam.
Why would I stare?
[Emily] You guys hungry? Like I have to ask.
Who's this?
[Jared] Bella Swan. Who else?
Hmm, so… You're the vampire girl.
So, you're… the wolf girl.
Guess so. Well, I'm engaged to one.
Save some for your brothers. And ladies first. Muffin?
Sure. Thanks.
Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order.
Um, he didn't say anything to me.
That's a wolf thing.
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want 'em to or not.
Oh, and check it out. We can hear each other's thoughts.
Would you shut up? These are trade secrets. Damn it! This chick runs with vampires.
Damn it! This chick runs with vampires.
You can't really run with vampires.
'Cause they're fast.
Yeah? Well, we're faster.
Freaked out yet?
You're not the first monsters I've met.
Jake's right. You're good with weird.
Hey.
Sorry.
So you're a werewolf.
Yeah. Last time I checked.
A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.
If a bloodsucker moves into town, then the fever sets in.
Mono.
Yeah, I wish.
Well, can't you find a way to just… stop?
I mean, it's wrong.
It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.
I was born this way, I can't help it.
You're such a hypocrite. What, I'm not the right kind of monster for you?
It's not what you are.
It's what you do. They never hurt anybody.
-You've killed people, Jake. -Bella.
-You've killed people, Jake. -Bella. We're not killing anyone.
Then who is?
What we're trying to protect you people from.
The only thing we do kill.
Vampires.
Wait, Jake, you can't.
Don't worry, we can't touch your little precious Cullens
unless they violate the treaty.
I… It's not what I'm saying. [stutters]
You can't kill vampires. They'll…
They'll kill you.
Really? We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.
Laurent?
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.
Vic… Victoria is here?
Was. We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.
She keeps coming back. We don't know what she's after.
I do.
Me.
Don't worry. We've got this place covered.
She won't get near you or Charlie.
Look, you gotta be careful.
She's fast. You don't know how fast she is.
You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.
All right, I better go.
You gotta go.
[Jacob] Yeah.
Got a vampire to kill.
[Bella] Alice, I'm all right.
Until I'm alone.
And lately, that's all the time.
Jacob's gone, he's hunting Victoria.
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.
And you're gone.
And so is Edward.
And there's just nothing now.
You got something, Harry?
Nope, nothing.
[Bella] But I realize where I have to go.
What I have to do to see him again.
[Edward] Don't do this.
You wanted me to be human.
Watch me.
[Edward] Please.
For me.
You won't stay with me any other way.
[Edward] Bella, please.
[Jacob] Breathe.
Breathe.
Come on, Bella. Breathe.
Bella. Bella, can you hear me?
-Jake? -[sighs]
Come here.
[Jacob] What the hell were you thinking?
I just wanted to see something.
Get her home! I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place.
[Bella] What happened at Harry's?
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.
Charlie and my dad are over at his place with his family.
Is he okay?
He's gone.
Come on. I'll get you something dry and drive you home.
Hundred and eight degrees over here.
God.
My hands are freezing.
It must be nice never getting cold.
It's a wolf thing.
It's not. It's a Jacob thing.
You're just warm.
You're like your own sun.
[Jacob] Is this better? Now that you know about me.
But…
You saw what happened to Emily.
Sam got angry.
Lost it for a split second…
Em was standing too close.
He'll never be able to take that back.
What if I got mad at you?
Sometimes…
I feel like I'm gonna disappear.
Okay, not that you need me to tell you something like this.
But I always will. You're not gonna lose yourself.
I wouldn't let that happen.
How?
I'll tell you all the time…
how special you are. [chuckles]
Thank you. For everything.
-Wait. -[gasps]
There's a vampire.
How do you know?
I can smell it. I'm getting you out of here.
[Bella] That's Carlisle's car.
They're here.
Bella, it's a trick. Stop! -You gotta come with me. -[grunts]
They won't hurt me.
Look, if a Cullen is back here, this is their territory.
Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands.
-I can't protect you here. -Okay, it's okay. You don't have to.
You're about to cross a line.
Then don't draw one. Please?
Alice?
-Oh, my God. -[Alice] Bella. What are you… [gasps]
I'm sorry, I just-- I can't believe you're here. Is… [stutters]
Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?
What?
I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?
-I mean, what about Charlie? What about-- -I didn't try to kill myself.
I was cliff jumping. Recreationally.
It was fun. [sniffling]
I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.
-[sighs] -Just…
Did you… did you tell him?
No.
He only calls in once every few months.
He said he wants to be alone.
Bella, what is that god-awful wet dog smell?
Um… that's probably me.
Or it's Jacob.
[Alice] Jacob who?
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.
Bella! Werewolves are not good company to keep.
Speak for yourself.
I had to see you were safe.
I thought you couldn't protect me here.
Guess I don't care.
[Alice] Well, I'm not going to hurt her.
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.
-Victoria? -Yeah, Victoria's been around.
I didn't see her.
I didn't see you get pulled out of the water either.
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts.
-Don't get me upset. -Hey, stop.
-Don't get me upset. -Hey, stop. -Or things are gonna get very ugly. -Stop, stop. Stop, stop.
I'll give you a minute.
Hey.
You're not going anywhere, you're gonna come back, right?
You're not going anywhere, you're gonna come back, right? As soon as you put the dog out.
Is he…?
Are there others? How many Cullens are here,
and how long are they staying?
No.
It's just Alice. [sniffs]
And she can stay as long as she'd like.
Are the rest coming back?
No.
Not that I know of. [scoffs]
Anything else?
That's it.
Well, if that's all, then you'd better go run back to Sam.
I've done it again.
[Jacob] I keep breaking my promise.
We don't have to do this to each other.
Yes, we do.
[whispering] Bella.
Swan residence.
He's not here right now.
He's arranging a funeral.
Who was that?
What?
Always in the way.
-Who was that? -Bella, step back.
-Jake, who was that? -Bella. Bella, it's Edward. He thinks you're dead.
Bella, it's Edward. He thinks you're dead. [Alice] Rosalie told him why I came here.
Why would you… Why didn't you let me speak to him?
-He didn't ask for you. -I don't care!
-He didn't ask for you. -I don't care! Bella, he's going to the Volturi.
He wants to die too.
[Jacob] He left you, Bella. He didn't want you anymore, remember?
No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.
Well, what about your dad?
I'm 18. I'm legally free to go and I left a note.
-Please, Bella. -[key jingles]
Just… stay here.
[Jacob] For Charlie.
For me.
I have to go.
I'm begging you.
Please.
Goodbye, Jacob.
Okay.
So you've made up your minds.
I'm afraid your particular gifts…
are too valuable to destroy.
[clicks tongue] But if you're unhappy with your lot,
join us.
We would be delighted to utilize your skills.
Won't you consider staying with us?
You know it will happen anyway.
Not without cause.
Such a waste.
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?
I figured you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto.
[Bella] Not today.
What? What do you see?
They refused him.
So… He's gonna make a scene. Show himself to the humans.
He's gonna make a scene. Show himself to the humans. [Bella] No! When?
[Alice] He's gonna wait until noon, when the sun's at its highest.
-Alice, you gotta hurry up. -There's Volterra.
-Why are they all in red? -San Marco's Day festival.
They're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city.
It's the perfect setting.
The Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself.
We have five minutes.
-[panting] -You know, Bella, just breathe.
-Alice. -Bella,
you're the only one he can't see coming.
If I go, he'll read my thoughts. He'll think I'm lying. -He'll rush into it. -Where do I go?
-He'll rush into it. -Where do I go? [Alice] He'll be under the clock tower. Go!
Don't!
[Edward] Heaven.
You have to move. [panting]
Open your eyes, look at me. I'm alive.
You have to move. [breathes shakily]
Bella.
-You're here. -I'm here.
You're alive.
Yes.
I needed to make you see me once.
You had to know I was alive,
you didn't have to feel guilty about anything.
I can let you go now.
I never acted out of guilt.
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.
Oh, but you said… [Edward] I lied. I had to lie.
[Edward] I lied. I had to lie. But you believed me so easily.
Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me.
I'm a nothing human. Nothing.
Bella… …you're everything to me.
You're everything.
I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.
Aro wants to speak with you again.
No rules were broken.
Nonetheless, we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue.
Fine.
Bella, why don't you go enjoy the rest of the festival.
- The girl comes with us. - No, you can go to hell.
Come on, guys.
It's a festival. You wouldn't want to make a scene.
We wouldn't.
Enough.
Jane.
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.
Just do as she says.
Go ahead.
Don't be scared.
Are you?
-No. -[Jane scoffs]
Is she human? Yes.
Does she know?
Yes.
Then why would…
She wants to be.
And so she will be.
For dessert.
[Alec] Sister. Send you out to get one and you bring back two.
And a half.
-Such a clever girl. -What a happy surprise!
Bella is alive after all.
Isn't that wonderful.
I love a happy ending.
They are so rare.
[Aro] Her blood appeals to you so much.
It makes me thirsty.
How can you stand to be so close to her?
It's not without difficulty. Yes, I can see that. [laughs]
Aro can read every thought I've ever had with one touch.
[Edward] And now you know everything.
So get on with it.
You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward.
Though… you can't read Bella's thoughts.
Fascinating.
I would love to see if…
you are an exception to my gifts, as well.
Would you do me the honor?
Interesting.
I see nothing.
[Aro] I wonder if…
Let us see if she is immune to all our powers.
Shall we, Jane?
No! Pain.
-[Bella] Stop! -[grunts]
[Bella] Don't, please stop.
[Bella shouting] Stop! Just stop hurting him, please! Please!
Jane?
-Master? -[grunts]
Go ahead, my dear.
This may hurt just a little.
Remarkable.
[Aro] She confounds us all.
So, what do we do with you now?
You already know what you're going to do, Aro.
She knows too much.
She's a liability.
[Aro] That's true.
Felix.
-[gasping] -[Edward] No!
-[cracks] -[Bella] Please! No. No, please, please!
Kill me, kill me. Not him.
[Aro] How extraordinary.
You would give up your life… for someone like us?
A vampire.
A soulless monster.
[Edward] Just get away from her.
You don't know a thing… about his soul.
[sighing] This is a sadness.
If only it were your intention to give her immortality.
[Alice] Wait!
Bella will be one of us.
I've seen it.
I'll change her myself.
Mesmerizing, to see what you have seen…
Mesmerizing, to see what you have seen… before it has happened.
Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal.
Isabella.
Go now.
Make your preparations.
Let us be done with this.
Heidi will arrive any moment.
Thank you… for your visit.
[Caius] We will return the favor.
I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon.
[Caius] We do not offer second chances.
[Aro] Goodbye, my young friends.
Nice fishing, Heidi.
Yes, they do look rather juicy.
Save some for me.
[Heidi] This way, please. Stay together.
Stop it, stop! [gasping]
You're here.
You can sleep.
I'll still be here when you wake up.
[Edward] Bella. The only reason I left…
was because I thought I was protecting you.
I needed you to have a chance
I needed you to have a chance at a normal, happy life.
It was so easy for you to leave.
Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 100 years.
I swear…
…I will never fail you again.
I'm so sorry.
Charlie's coming. Hey.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Dad, you don't have to worry.
The last time you said that you took off.
I didn't see you for three days.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
Bella… do not ever do that to me again.
Ever.
And you're grounded…
for the rest of your life.
Okay.
We're not technically breaking any of his rules.
He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door.
I came in through the window.
He's not gonna forgive me easily.
No.
Can you?
I hope you can, 'cause I honestly don't know
I hope you can, 'cause I honestly don't know how to live without you.
[Edward softly] Come here.
Once Alice changes me,
you can't get rid of me.
She won't need to change you.
There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
No.
No.
You all know what I want.
And I know how much I'm asking for.
The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair is to just vote.
You don't know what you're talking about. Shut up.
Alice.
I already consider you my sister.
- Yes. - Thank you.
I vote yes.
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry to both of you how I've acted.
And I'm really grateful that you were brave enough
to go and save my brother.
But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.
And I wish that there had been someone to vote no for me.
So, no.
I vote hell, yeah. [laughs]
And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.
I already consider you a part of the family.
Yes.
Why are you doing this to me?
You know what this means.
You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice.
I won't lose my son.
[Bella] I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.
He wants to talk to me.
[Jacob] So you're still alive for now.
[Edward] He thinks it's me keeping you away.
[Jacob] You stay the hell out of my head.
[Edward] Jacob…
I know you have something to say to me.
But I want to say something to you first, if that's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when… I didn't.
No. You didn't.
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.
I'm still grateful.
But I'm here now, and I'm not going to leave her side
But I'm here now, and I'm not going to leave her side until she orders me away.
We'll see.
[Jacob] Hey. My turn to talk.
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty.
I haven't forgotten.
What key point?
If any of them bites a human, the truce is over.
What if I choose it? It has nothing to do with you.
No. No, I won't let you.
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.
It's not up to you.
You know what we'll do to you. I won't have a choice.
-Bella, please come. -Wait.
Is he gonna hurt me? Read his mind.
Jake.
I love you.
So, please…
don't make me choose.
[Bella] 'Cause it'll be him.
It's always been him.
Bella.
Goodbye, Jacob. No, you don't speak for her.
Bella, get out of here.
[Bella] Stop!
Stop!
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.
[Bella] Jacob.
[Edward] He's right.
You shouldn't become what I am.
I can't do this alone.
Then please just wait.
Just give me… five years.
That's too long.
Then three.
You're so stubborn.
What are you waiting for?
I have one condition.
If you want me to do it myself.
What's the condition?
And then forever.
