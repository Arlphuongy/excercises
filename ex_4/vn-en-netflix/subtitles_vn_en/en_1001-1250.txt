Hold the line!
Come here!
Keda!
You failed.
Pass.
Fail.
Fail.
Pass.
Pain will journey with us.
Stop!
Stop, father, you stink!
You will hunt at my side.
You are the chief's son. My son.
Prove you can lead. Find your strength.
He is not ready.
One season each year...
...we hunt the Great Beast.
We do this, or our tribe dies.
He must do his part.
Prove himself to the tribe.
What if he can't...
I love him with my whole heart.
He could die. I am afraid.
He leads with his heart.
Not his spear.
Take this... so nothing will harm you.
I can take care of myself.
Keda.
Know that I love you.
He will show us that he is a man.
Earn his place to lead.
Then come home to you.
You can't promise that.
Go.
To survive we must focus... Be patient.
We must not give up.
Father...
My friend.
You have survived the winter. A little fatter maybe?
Yes.
And I bring a young hunter...
Raise your head... and your eyes will follow.
This is my son.
Mine will not see another hunt.
He has gone to the ancestors.
You must be a proud father.
I hope he makes me proud.
Our tribe has walked the sacred Path since the first Great Hunt.
Marks guide our way. Made by our ancestors.
Left as a trail for us to follow.
And to help us survive the great journey.
Our hands point us to the hunting ground.
Some will return.
Some will not.
Those marks remain... for the leader to bring the hunters home.
Finish it.
You take a life to give life to your tribe.
Do it. Now.
I'm sorry!
Life is for the strong!
It is earned, not given.
Be calm.
Stay alert.
He is gone...
...but we must stay strong.
May his spirit watch over the Path...
...as his ancestors before him.
The stone markers guide you during the day.
Now you bear the marks...
...that will guide you at night.
The light from our ancestors...
...showing us the way home.
Home.
You see that one?
That is the Alpha, their leader.
The Alpha must care for his pack. Above all else.
But he is also always in danger.
Others in the pack will challenge him...
...if they sense weakness.
The Alpha lets the others know his place...
...with his strength and calm.
He was not born the Alpha.
But he earned it with his courage... and his heart.
Go!
[Tau] Keda!
Keda!
Keda!
Do not look down!
Don't let go!
[Tau] [echoing] Keda!
My friend...
...my leader...
It is impossible to reach him!
He is gone.
We can't lose you, too.
We have a duty to our people.
Load the sleds.
We must return to our village.
May the Spirits guide and protect your people.
Tell him our sons shall walk together in the other world.
You must let him go.
Set him free.
He is with the Spirits now.
Father!
Father!
Father!
Father!
Hyenas, we must find shelter.
A friend.
Maybe not.
Do not bite me.
I am not going to hurt you.
I will keep you alive.
Friend.
See.
It has to be cleaned.
See...
...not that bad.
Patience.
I have not forgiven you.
It is up to me.
You have to wait for your turn.
I am glad we understand each other.
Home.
You miss them, your pack...
I hear my parents calling me in my dreams.
But I can't get to them...
It's getting colder.
The Sacred Path will cover with snow soon...
I don't know if I can make it home without my father.
I'm not like him...
...but I have to try.
I miss my parents so much.
That belongs to me.
I need that.
I have to be home before the first snow.
You should go home too.
Go ahead!
Stop looking at me!
Go ahead!
Where are you going?
What do you want?
Go home!
Go on, get out of here!
I almost had him.
Did you see that?
I just slipped.
I'm not afraid of anything.
Hey, what are you doing?
Come back here!
Hey!
Over here!
Wait!
No!
You know I'll feed you.
You stink.
Get in the water!
Don't make me chase you.
Come here, come here.
I will call you Alpha.
Keda.
Alpha.
Go to your family...
I'm sorry...
Please...
Alpha!
Tracks...
Help!
Help!
Friend!
No...
Stay.
Food... Food.
Nothing!
No!
Nothing!
We will be all right.
Thank you for helping us...
Run!
Alpha!
Thank you, my friend.
I will not give up on you...
You are my tribe.
The Path. We're close.
My ancestors are lighting the way...
...guiding us home.
Please. Get up.
I know you can do it.
We have come so far together...
I can't lose you.
Please, Alpha.
I just need a little rest...
He could die. I am afraid.
He leads with his heart.
Not his spear.
No.
He is stronger than you know.
He is stronger than even he knows.
We're home.
How can this be?
Father.
Keda!
I was afraid I'd never see you again.
You are here. With us. You are really home.
I wanted to make you proud.
You earned it, my son. You came home to us.
Alpha.
Alpha needs...
Help.
Keda has brought you home to us. You are family.
Hey, if you play this song,
I guarantee motherfuckers'll start hopping and squirming.
When I used to play this record live, motherfuckers would actually faint.
They would faint on the floor.
I'd have to call the amba-lance and pick all these motherfuckers up.
Every time I played this. They start callin' the hospital in advance
and tell them, "Rudy gonna be singing tonight.
Make sure y'all ready, 'cause we finna be carrying motherfuckers out the club."
"Buggy Ride"?
Hey, that ain't no small-time shit, man.
Goddamn, Rudy. I got Marvin Gaye singing "Let's Get It On."
I can't be playin' no "Buggy Ride."
-I got 60 seconds to get to the next tune. -Okay, man, how about this?
This a nice R&B single.
It's a catchy thing called "Step It Up and Go."
Heh. Come on, are you for real?
Hey, man, that shit right there was monumental.
That's my number one selling single.
Put the shit in rotation, see what happens.
This looks like something my grandfather would listen to, you dig?
No. Forty-five seconds.
Okay, man. Look, I saved the best for last.
Now that's a smash, huh?
"Ring A Ling A Dong"?
-I ain't heard this one yet. -Hey, that's a catchy motherfucker, man.
♪ Ring-a-ling-dong, ding, dong, ding ♪
♪ Ring-a-ling-ding-dong Ding-dong-ding ♪
♪ Ring-a-ling-ding-dong Ding-dong-ding ♪
♪ Won't you ring Them wedding bells for me? ♪
Rudy. Man, I only play the hits.
Hey, but that should've been a hit, man.
Those motherfuckers at Federal Records was gonna take it all the way to the top.
Man, they signed me. Was gonna do it all. Promote the shit out of the thang,
and then they signed that fucking James Brown.
He come out jumping around, doing splits and shit
and shaking his black ass and sucked up all the attention.
Say, man, do you think I wanna work at a ghetto record store as a DJ?
Sometimes our dreams just don't come true.
They still can.
Nah, brother.We missed our shots.
[sighs] I think we both need to get back to work.
All right, man. Thanks for nothing.
-Marvin Gaye ain't shit. -[song continues]
S-L-Y to the Family Stone. You're rocking with your main man, DJ Roj,
large and in charge on your favorite radio station-- KRKD Los Angeles.
-Can you dig it? -[man] Hey, man, can I pay for this?
All right, young blood.
How you doing today, young brother? All right, man.
Stevie Wonder and Stylistics.
Yeah, you listen to the good stuff.
Man, you got shipments piled up in back, and I been on this register all morning.
-Sorry I'm late, Rudy. My apologies. -Move your ass. Man, here's your change.
My apologies.
Ring that up for me, Toney.

Hey, my man.
All right.

Ladies and gentlemen, it is so good to be here tonight.
I only recently returned back from Broadway.
Yes, I was on Broadway.
I was on Broadway for six whole months
standing on the corner trying to find a job.
What did the elephant say to the naked man?
"Are you gonna breathe with that small thing?"
All right, without any further ado, I'd like to bring to the stage...
...the hot musical sounds of our headliner--The Ben Taylor Band.
...the hot musical sounds of our headliner--The Ben Taylor Band. Come on, give it up for The Ben Taylor Band.
-Hey, the show popping tonight, huh? -Rudy, you went over your limit.
The people was enjoying my appeal, so I stretched it out a little bit.
The deal is five minutes.
Hey, I ain't on the marquee out front. How come you didn't put me on the front?
You the emcee. Nobody paying to see you.
Maybe they would, Mr. Allen. I was thinking,
maybe you should just consider getting me my own slot.
Know what I mean? 'Cause I'm a total entertainment experience.
I sing, I do comedy, and I dance,
and I do a dance called adagio dancing
where I come out in a turban, and I do it to a African beat. -It's very erotic. -Rudy, that's 1950.
-It's very erotic. -Rudy, that's 1950.
Vaudeville is dead. I don't need an all-in-one.
Shit, I ain't that old.
Who do you think I am, Pigmeat Markham or Moms Mabley?
I got something to offer.
Rat soup-eatin' motherfucker.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much.
[man] Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to take you to the track one more time.
And here's a late scratch, ladies and gentlemen.
Anna's Ass has been scratched.
It's not the first time Anna's Ass has been scratched.
The last one was a shame,
because I would love to have seen Anna's Ass up against My Dick today.
That's some funny shit.
He ain't that funny. He just cussing up a storm.
He ain't cussing.
It's clever. I don't know. See...
My Dick ain't his dick. My Dick is actually his horse.
I know what My Dick is. I ain't a fucking imbecile.
He's just using a double entendre so the police don't come get his ass.
You know, I used to work with Redd Foxx.
-You knew Redd Foxx? -Oh, yeah.
We was in the kitchen washing dishes together,
but I worked with the motherfucker.
One day, he went up in front of the right promoter, got his big break.
Oh, here go that fucking Ricco.
Ah, man, he smells like urine. He be touching the door.
-Man, go stop him. -I'm not stopping shit, man.
I'm assistant manager. I'm delegating to you.
You deal with stinking-ass Ricco.
I'm not going anywhere near them germs, man.
Ricco responds best to authority, so the manager should do it.
Oh, shit, man.
Hell, no, Ricco. Not today.
I was born in a barrel of butcher knives.
Been shot in the ass by two Colt .45s.
I know, I know.
Been slapped by a bear and bit by an eel.
I chew up railroad iron, and I shit out steel.
All right, nigga, let's go. That's it.
Jumped in the ocean and swallowed a whale.
Handcuffed lightning, throwed thunder's ass in jail.
[Rudy] Look, Ricco, this ain't no place for your hobo stories.
Whoa, I ain't no hobo.
I am a repository of Afro-American folklore.
Come on. Lookit, brother. I just need some money to get something to eat.
I ain't got no teeth. All I can do is sip on some soup.
Come on, give me a quarter.
Ricco, I'm gonna give you a quarter. You go get you some soup.
Then you just got to get up out of here. Let's go, man.
-Get my black ass on. -Go on now. All right, okay.
First, I'm gonna tell you one of the funniest fuckin' things you ever did hear.
-Oh, come on, man. -Some people think that Willie Green...
was the baddest man the world had ever seen.
But I want you to light up a joint, screw your wig on tight,
and let me tell you about a little bad motherfucker called Dolemite.
[man] Man, I haven't heard those in a long time.
-Dolemite, Signifying Monkey. -He did all of them ones.
'Cause I had a uncle that was in jail,
and they was doing that shit all the time, telling jokes,
'cause they had nothing else to do.
You could fuck. Yes, Toney, you could fuck, but we ain't talking about that right now.
Yes, Toney, you could fuck, but we ain't talking about that right now.
Hey, you know what I was thinking, man.
What y'all think would happen if somebody took those jokes...
a professional, and polished them, and turn it into a act?
Yeah, and did it on a stoop. [laughs]
-In a barbershop? -Yeah, in a barbershop.
-Rudy, that's a good idea. -Yeah, man, that shit could work.
Say, Rudy man, all them slave jokes, that shit not gonna work.
I wouldn't put it in my act, personally.
-Hey, man, funny is funny. -They're not ready for the big time.
I don't know what time it's gonna make it to, but the shit is funny.
Look here. Them white folks gonna see that country-ass nigga get up onstage
and say, "Now what in the fuck is he about to say now?" [laughs]
Before I go out, I always keep "The Morning After" in my hip pocket,
-just in case there's any white faces. -What the hell is "The Morning After"?
Don't be ignant. The love theme from The Poseidon Adventure.
Oh, man, what in the fuck you gonna learn that shit for?
You ain't gonna never play that for whitey.
Last thing they wanna see
is your big black ass onstage singing "The Morning After."
And I know you ain't sitting here criticizing nobody.
You stealing jokes from hobos and bums arou--
Hey, you know what?
Fuck you, niggas. Fuck y'all know, anyway?
Rudy.
Rudy.
Man, I'm sorry. We was just havin' a little fun.
Hey, man, how'd my life get so damn small?
I came out here with some big plans, Jimmy.
I was gonna do it all, just like Sammy Davis Jr.
Movies, concerts, TV. Everything.
This job at Dolphin's supposed to be my temporary day job.
Cut to a million years later, it's all I got.
-You still got the Californian Club. -Oh, man. That ain't gonna lead to shit.
I ain't got nothing nobody want.
-[man] Man, he got somethin'. -[second man] Yeah.
[second man] Man, who the-- Who is this?
I don't know, man. You ever seen him?
-No, I ain't never seen any-- -Hey, brothers.
How y'all doing tonight? I'm trying to find Ricco.
Ricco? Who in the fuck is that?
That's a old bum with no teeth.
-You mean like this? -[both chuckle]
Oh, shit. Guess that ain't narrow it down at all, did it?
It ain't like it used to be.
This neighborhood been went to shit, man. It's sad, sad, sad.
You see this building over here? That's the Dunbar Hotel.
That used to be the center of black arts entertainment.
I saw Duke Ellington there, Billie Holiday,
but now it's just filled with a bunch of junkies and winos.
-Junkies and winos. -Tony, I'm gonna pay your money. Shit.
[Rudy] Oh, shit. There he go right there.
-Ricco. Hey, man. -[man] That what you been talking about?
Hey, brother! How you doing, Ricco?
-What's going on, man? -I don't know you.
Yeah, man. I'm your friend from Dolphin's Records.
Ain't you the son of a bitch that throws me out?
Oh, no, Ricco. That's that other guy, man.
Hey, man, look. Look here, man. I got some money, and I got some hooch.
How you like to sit down and tell me your stories?
[Ricco] Cocaine Shorty's my name. Fuckin' is my claim.
You can line 98 hos up against a wall, I bet you a dollar I can fuck 'em all.
-I can top that. -[man] Oh, no, you can't top that.
Hey, neither can he.
-I'm the funniest motherfucker out here. -[man] Hey, don't need to argue, fellas.
Hold on now. I got some more money.
I wanna hear from all the liquor store wise men.
Okay, let's go now. What's next?
[man] I fucked an elephant and her mother.
I fucked the bull, the cow, and her brother.
I need a better punchline.
Fucked a... cow-- bull, a cow.
Fucked a elephant. Dared her to mutter.
I could look up a bull's ass and tell you the price of butter.
That is funny.
Fucked an elephant down to a coon.
Even fucked the same-- Yes, I fucked an elephant down to a coon.
I fucked a elephant down to a coon!
Yes, I fucked a elephant down to a coon.
Even fucked the same cow that jumped over the motherfucking moon.
[Ricco] I got kicked out of South America for fucking steers.
I fucked a she elephant till she broke down in tears.
I got thrown out of South America for fucking steers.
I fucked King Kong's mama till she broke down in tears.
Dole-Dolemite is my...
Dolemite is my name.
Way down in the jungle deep,
lion stepped on the s--
[loudly] Way down in the jungle deep...
a lion stepped on a signified monkey's feet!
Dolemite is my name, and fucking up motherfuckers is my game!
-[jazz music playing] -[man] All right.
How it is that he can take you beautiful people with him?
[woman] That's my kinfolk. Come on now.
Stay right here. [laughs] Yes, sir.
The fuck is you in tux? What'd you do to your hair? You look like a pimp.
I come up with a new character and all new material, too.
Well, actually, it's old material.
I don't need this.
Just stick to your regular set.
Way down in the jungle deep...
the lion stepped on the signified monkey's feet.
The monkey said, "Motherfucker, can't you see...
you standing on my goddamn feet?"
The lion said, "I ain't heard a word you said.
If you say three more, I'll jump off on your motherfucking head." -[laughter] -[drum sting]
Man, don't give me that Buddy Hackett shit.
Make that shit swing. Put your weight on it.
-[plays percussive rhythm] -Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
But the monkey got wise and started using his wit.
Said, "I think I'm gonna bring an end to all this ass-kicking shit."
He ran up on the lion the very next day.
He said, "Oh, Mr. Lion,
there's a big, bad, burly motherfucker coming your way."
He said, "And he's somebody that you don't know...
'cause he just broke-a loose from Ringling Brothers' show."
Said, "He talked about your people in a hell of a way.
Yes, he talked about your people till my hair turned gray."
He said, "Your daddy's a freak, and your mama's a whore."
Said, "He spotted you in the jungle sellin' your black ass from door to door."
He said, "Your sister got down and did a hell of a trick.
She got so low, she sucked a earthworm's dick."
He said he corn-holed your uncle, fucked your auntie and your niece,
and the next time he see your grandma, he gonna get him another good piece.
I ain't lying!
-Smells good. -[woman chuckles]
-[woman] Just like back home, right? -Yes, Lord.
Say, when's the last time you been back to Arkansas?
Oh, a long time. I ain't got a lot of good memories from back home,
so I don't be thinking about back home much.
Basically, when I think about back home, I think, "Fuck back home."
Hey, you know, Auntie?
You know, I was thinking about maybe putting out another record.
Another record? Why don't you help me get rid of some of that shit
that's stacked up over there in the corner? "Another record."
This time, I'm gonna put out a comedy record.
Comedy? You've been a singer, you've been a shake dancer,
and one time, I think you even called yourself a fortune teller.
You know it's real hard to break in. I'd do whatever it takes to get in.
Is it gonna be like that cute lil' Bill Cosby?
He's so sweet.
He tells those family tales about the kids playing in the street,
playing jacks and such. I like that.
Yeah, there's gonna be stories about family and kids
-and a grandma and grandpa. -Oh, that's nice.
So, yeah, it's gonna be stories, but listen. Here's what the thing is.
-I'm trying to be entrepreneurial on this. -Oh, let us bow our heads and pray.
Father God, I wanna thank you for giving me the strength
to make this meal for my beloved family.
Let us nourish our body in Jesus' name. Amen.
-Thank you, Lord. -All right, then.
Thank you for this pork chop. Now, as I was saying--
-You want some hot sauce? -Come on now, Auntie, now.
I wanna be entrepreneurial on this thing, and I need you to loan me some money
-so I can get some recording equipment. -No, no.
-Mm-mmm. -Come on, Auntie. You rich, woman.
I'm not rich. What make you think I'm rich?
What happened to all that money you made when you fell off that bus?
Uh, that is my money to do with what I want to,
and I only got $250.
That's exactly how much I need to be a star.
-Come on, woman. Loan me... -I got my coat on layaway...
-Please... -I'm already into 'em for $50...
She gonna give me the money.
'Cause you about to cut off my air supply. Get up from around my neck.
-Why you so fucking stingy, then? -Ain't this a bitch?
-Give me the money, woman. -[sighs]
Why the hell is there a line? You told me we were going to a party.
We are going to a party. We're making a party record.
Come on in. Come on in. Watch your step.
-Watch your step. -Gimme some skin, baby.
Come on in. Watch your step.
Fedco gin? I didn't even know they made alcohol.
Nigga, we ain't going for flavor.
Look, I don't see how this can work. We should be in a real club.
I don't wanna hear that shit. We got what we got. Gotta make it work.
-You're my producer, right? -I am?
What do you think we're doing here? We producing an album.
-Okay. -Okay, all right? Come here, man.
Okay.
Hey, man, get these people limber and loose.
Right, right, right, right. [breathes deeply]
Producer.
Oh, guess I'm producing.
All right, y'all know what it is. Y'all know what time it is.
It's show time, y'all. Come on now.
Give yourself a round of applause.
Okay, I want everybody to have a good time tonight.
We doing a album this evening, a live recording.
We got a engineer back there. He's professional.
That nigga done been on Leave It to Beaver and Gunsmoke. All kinds of shit.
Okay. Yeah, all right, y'all. The time we've been waiting for.
The man of the hour. The man, the myth.
You love him, and I love him.
Put your hands together for Rudy Ray Moore.
Some folks say Willie Green...
was the baddest motherfucker that the world had ever seen.
I want you to light you up a joint, take a real good shit,
and screw your wig on tight.
And let me tell you about that bad motherfucker called Dolemite.
Dolemite. Come on, Rudy.
[Rudy on tape] Now, Dolemite was born in San Antone.
A rambling, gambling, scrambling motherfucker since the day he was born.
On the day he was dropped from his mammy's ass...
he slapped his pappy in the face, and said,
"From now on, cocksucker, I'm running this place."
-At the age of one-- -Okay, I've heard enough.
-Hey, but you haven't even got to the-- -It's filthy. And I know filthy.
Jesus, you can't play that over the radio.
And you can't sell it over the counter in most cities.
Record stores, they don't wanna be raided.
Raided? Hey, come on, man. The world has changed.
Deep Throat is a big-ass hit movie, and the lady sucks a cock in every scene.
Yeah, in porno houses.
Record stores, they're a family business.
Kids go in.
Uh, look, on vinyl, you can call a guy a cocksucker,
but you can't say he sucks a cock.
-Can you grasp the distinction? -No, I do not.
If I want to say that a woman's pussy is so hot,
it makes a motherfucker's asshole burn, then I'm gonna say it!
Then say it.
But you've got a product here that you can't sell or promote.
-[door slams] -What'd he say?
Shit, man, we just got into some legal semantic argument about cocksucking.
You know what, man? Fuck him. We gonna put this shit out ourself.
Come on.
-Say, Rudy. What's with the devil faces? -I want it to look illegal.
-Say, Rudy. What's with the devil faces? -I want it to look illegal. Real naughty. Like some shit they ain't supposed to have.
Real naughty. Like some shit they ain't supposed to have.
[Rudy] Yes, I rode across the ocean on the head of my dick.
Ate nine tons of cat shit and ain't never got sick.
Rudy.
I fucked bitches and paid my rent.
I don't owe a living ass a motherfucking cent.
So, motherfuckers, can't you see?
I pity the son of a bitch that fucks with me.
I can walk the desert sand and never leave a track.
Fuck the hump out of a camel's back.
Hey, man. All right, wait for a second. Wanna buy one of these ashtrays, nigga?
[man] Welcome back to the Californian Club
Mr. Dolemite himself--Rudy Ray Moore.
Yes, I want you to listen and listen well.
'Cause I'm that bad motherfucker that drove the devil out of hell.
I once walked from New York City to the deep, deep South
just to slap a son of a bitch in his motherfucking mouth.
Mules have kicked me, and they didn't bruise my hide.
A rattlesnake bit me and then just crawled off and died.
'Cause Dolemite is my name, and fucking up motherfuckers is my game.
[over record] He said, "Your daddy's a freak,and your mama's a whore."
Said he spotted you in the jungle selling your black ass from door-to-door.
Quiet. Listen.
Said your sister got down and did a hell of a trick.
She got so low she sucked a earthworm's dick.
-What the hell is this? -Every black hipster is listening to it.
You go down Crenshaw, South Central, Baldwin Hills--
this is blasting out of every door.
It's insane.
The guy is actually selling it out of his car trunk.
And you think this can cross over?
To who? Whites?
No. To blacks who don't shop out of car trunks.
I just want to say to all you Bihari brothers
that I am ecstatic. Anything y'all want me to do, man.
Whatever it takes to make this record go up the charts, I'm ready to do it.
Okay, Rudy. We're glad to hear that.
If y'all need me on the Chitlin Circuit, I can do that.
I know all the clubs. I could hit the radio stations...
[man] Right, right.
We have a crack marketing promotion team. We'll figure this out.
[Rudy] All my life, I've been wanting to be famous, you know?
But this is more than that. This is about connecting with the people.
You know, this is my moment.
So anyway, the name of the album is "Eat Out More Often," right?
So I'm thinking we got the girl lying on the day bed,
you're sneaking up on her, you're peering over spread legs.
See what I'm saying?
Lemme show you what me and Crystal worked out.
Crystal, honey, show 'em what we worked out.
I'm like Muhammad Ali. We getting ready to shock the worlds.
I got to be totally outrageous.
That's what I'm talking about.
Hey, give me that. Crystal, lay out here for a second for me, honey.
-[Crystal] How do you want me? -Just lay out on the thing here.
Uh, yeah, I like that. Put that over just a little bit.
Just-- Gimme-- You know, gimme somethin'. Yeah. And hold on to this.
Oh, shit now.
Yeah, something like this.
[Rudy] Yes, it sure is good to be here in Mississippi.
The only place where the ducks fly upside down,
'cause it ain't nothing worth shitting on.
I used to know a fella from Mississippi. He was so dumb.
This motherfucker was so dumb, he thought manual labor was a Mexican.
He was so dumb, he thought that Kotex was mattress for mice.
This motherfucker was so dumb, he turned down a blow job
'cause he thought they'd stop giving him his unemployment check.
I ain't lying. This was a dumb motherfucker.
[radio DJ] I'm sitting here with Mr. Rudy Ray Moore,
who will be appearing here in Macon, Georgia, this Saturday night.
Yes, at Jasper's on Fifth Street.
All the pretty girls gotta pay half price.
Ugly girls get in for free.
[Rudy] Put your weight on it! Put your weight on it. Put your weight on it.
Put your weight on it! Put your weight on it. Put your weight on it.
My, my, my, my. My, my, my. Woman, you better close your legs 'fore I eat off your drawers.
The other day, I was with a young lady. I said to her, "Do you have a cherry?"
She said, "Rudy, of course I have a cherry.
But it's been pushed back so damn far, you could use it as a fucking taillight."
Look at it.
When you see it moving like that, it's talking to me.
Not only can it talk, it can sing, too.
You don't believe it can sing?
You don't believe it can sing? You don't believe it can sing?
Hey, baby, sing for my brother.
Damn!
Now, we all know what we've been waiting for.
The "now" comedian.
Like a "now" generation.
Mr. Dolemite himself.
Mr. Rudy Ray Moore.
Come on, let's hear it for Bobby Rush, the prince of the blues, y'all!
I know one thing-- this microphone smell like ass.
Yeah.
Hey, bartender, how about a drink for the pretty girl?
Come on now. I know what the hell I am.
I ain't pretty, and I sure as hell ain't no goddamn girl.
I'll have a daiquiri.
Your ass should be headlining here tomorrow with that right hand you got.
-That was a hell of a fight. -Fight? Shit.
You know, she can go on ahead and have his sorry ass
and his dangling ball sack.
Fucking breath smell like mildewed goddamn garlic.
He shouldn't be spending that paycheck for all his run-around hussies
when we got our son out here with holes in his britches and shoes.
How about that?
I'm Rudy.
-Lady Reed. -Lady Reed.
You ever been up onstage, Lady Reed?
Nah, I ain't show folk.
Oh, shit. Yeah, you are. I could tell.
Some people walk around with their own little personal spotlight.
I noticed that in you right 'fore you knocked that nigga on his ass.
I used to be a backup singer in New Orleans.
I knew it. I told you.
-You sure do. -Singer, huh?
I'd get so nervous, I had to hang on to the mic from not falling over.
Butterflies all in my stomach. Once, I even shit on the goddamn stage.
Yeah.
You're funny. You should be doing stand-up.
Nigga, you trying to hit on me? Because I just broke up five minutes ago on my cheating-ass man.
Because I just broke up five minutes ago on my cheating-ass man. -I'm really not in the fucking mood. -No. I'm serious.
-I'm really not in the fucking mood. -No. I'm serious.
Maybe you should be onstage like me.
Sweet Jesus.
I mean, I can make my son laugh.
But what-- what would I do?
I'm not really no pimp.
I ain't got no stable of whores. I just created a character.
I do it all the time. I been Prince DuMarr.
I been the Harlem Hillbilly. And tonight, look at this here.
-Tug on my shit. -Tug on what?
-Tug on my sh-- Just tug on me. -Tug on this?
Mm-hmm. Just give a little tug.
Don't tug too hard. Don't take the motherfucker off.
-Oh, shit. That's a motherfucking wig. -That's right.
It's all pretend. Put on a cape and turn into a fucking superhero.
Leave the real you behind. Go onstage and...
-Magic, huh? -[Rudy chuckles]
You a trip.
Yes. And now, ladies and gentlemen...
without any further ado,
I wanna introduce to y'all the first lady of Comedian International.
Come on, give it up for Queen Bee. Queen Bee. Come on, give it up, y'all.

Rudy, you got a phone call.
-Hello? -[Joe] Rudy?
Rudy, it's Joe Bihari. I've been looking all over for you.
-Have you seen Billboard? -Man, you sound crazy as cat shit.
I'm outside Tallahassee. Closest billboard is a hundred miles away.
Well, you're on the charts.
-[volume decreases] -What?
I'm serious, my friend. Shooting straight up with a bullet.
Now get your ass back to L.A. We need to record some more albums.
Ladies and gentlemen, Dolemite himself-- Mr. Rudy Ray Moore!
-Yeah! -[woman] Amen.
How's it goin', baby?
What's going on, my man? Yeah, yeah.
Hey, y'all, excuse me a second, man. Hey!
So will you play my record now, man?
My apologies, Mr. Dolemite. Coming right up.
Play that shit now. That's the good stuff.
Oh, you dirty motherfucker. Don't play that song.
Hey. You know you ain't right. Come on now. Play the right thing, man.
You know that ain't right, man. Hey, you know what?
That's still a bad motherfucker.
Merry Christmas, man.
What the funk is it?
Man, I'm gonna kill 'em with this. I'm gonna have 'em with the boots.
I almost kept that myself, man.
You deserve it, man. Merry Christmas to all of y'all.
-Thank you, Rudy. It's hot. -Yeah, I'm gonna get this, too.
Oh, I know damn sure you is. Shit, all that money he getting.
Hey, guys, I used to go see a movie every Christmas.
Y'all wanna see something? Lemme treat y'all to a picture show.
-How 'bout Blackenstein? -Oh, I wanna see Shaft in Africa.
[Rudy] Hey, how about Front Page?
The newspaper said it was the best, funniest thing in town.
I feel like laughing. Let's go laugh.
-Let's do it, shit. -All right.
[Burns] Gonna mention the Examiner? Don't we take credit?
-[Johnson] In the second paragraph. -[Burns] Who's gonna read the second?
For 15 years, I've been trying to teach you how to write a lead.
Do I have to do everything myself? Get the story? Write the story?
Listen, Saphead, I could blow a better story
out of my as-- my nose than you can write!
[Burns] Goddamn dilettante. Maybe Philadelphia is where you belong.
Making up jingles for Burma-Shave.
[Burns] Oh, really? Well, who wrote
the Deathbed Confession of Three-Finger Banducci, huh?
Hey, man, what the fuck is this? This shit ain't funny.
I don't get it.
-The fuck are they talking about? -I don't know shit.
Who is Herbert Hoover?
-And it ain't no brothers in it, either. -Shh.
Hey, don't "shh" me, Sandy Duncan.
♪ Cut out sweets ♪ ♪ Ooh-ooh ♪
-What the fuck was that, man? -That was some bullshit.
Nobody even got naked. Was that even a real movie?
[Toney] I told him let's go see Blackenstein.
[Ben] Why do these creaky old people get to star in movies?
-[Toney] White folks get all the breaks. -[Jimmy] Say, Rudy.
Since when you ain't saying shit?
I was just thinking, man.
This movie's playing 'cross the whole country.
It ain't got no titties, no funny, and no kung fu.
I was watching at that light that come out the projector.
They shine that motherfucker across the theater
onto a 80-foot-tall screen and then bam--it's like magic.
Know how many mule miles I had to drive cross this country
to get my name in people's mouth?
I got to get up on that light.
If I get up in that light, with my own movie,
I could be everywhere.
I could be everywhere all at once.
[Rudy] I have a gigantic fan base.
Just did a national tour, just got back from it.
And I had two albums hit the Billboard charts at the same time.
That's why I feel it's time for me to make my move to the big screen.
Right. If I could just shoot straight with you?
When we say gigantic fan base, aren't we really just talking about
When we say gigantic fan base, aren't we really just talking about a small group of passionate brothers and sisters here or there?
a small group of passionate brothers and sisters here or there?
I mean, your appeal is limited.
It's not exactly like you're playing the Apollo.
Now, surely you wouldn't suggest for American International
to invest the likes of $300,000 to turn this into a major production.
Yeah, but come on, man. I see all y'all's posters here. I fit in perfect.
Black folks love me.
Yeah, you see, that's the thing here, Rudy.
Here, we do a certain type of black picture.
The actors we hire are like, uh, Fred Williamson, Jim Brown.
Now, see, you on the other hand, you're a bit doughier than them, you see?
Doughier?
Well, hey, man, I put on a girdle. What I got to do?
Come on, brother. They waiting on Dolemite movie.
Let's bring Dolemite to the screen.
I don't know how much longer we can do these pictures, Rudy.
You see, that's why we changing our approach.
We got a new one coming. I bet you gonna like this.
You really gonna dig this one.
Check this out. It's called Cornbread, Earl and Me.
It's about a kid from the ghetto
that's the first from the neighborhood to get out and make it to college.
Now, don't that make you feel good on the inside, Rudy?
Brother, don't nobody wanna see no shit like that.
Come on, Rudy. Be realistic.
You're not a movie star. You're not an actor.
You're not Billy Dee Williams.
You're a comedy star. Be happy with that.
Man, I want more. All my life, people been telling me no.
My daddy always told me I was a piece of shit.
Just another dumb-ass country-poor nigga.
Thought I was gonna be a sharecropper like he was.
[chuckles] I can't imagine you plowing fields.
He wasn't my real daddy nohow.
Dirty rotten motherfucker always beating on me.
That's why I left home when I was 15, go and make something of myself.
Look, man. We all had shitty childhoods, but that don't mean you can just will yourself into being a movie star.
but that don't mean you can just will yourself into being a movie star.
Well, why not, Toney? Shit, I willed myself into being a comedian.
I willed myself into being a singer.
I even made my own album in my goddamn living room.
How come I can't be in the movies?
I want the world to know I exist.
How much money you planning on spending on this thing?
Well, I figure, you know, with money I got from my records, and...
I go ask the label for some money, I probably get about $70,000.
That's good, Rudy.
Well, hey, Rudy, how much money you gonna pay Jimmy
-for doing his shit since you know him? -We ain't discussed that stuff yet.
But you know my man don't work for free, right?
-You gon' fuck my money up. -You know you're not working for free?
Is that really enough to pay for all the people you gonna need?
At the movies, I always sit through the closing credits,
and that's a lot of folk. Key grip, best boy.
-Wish I had me a best boy. -[Reed] Okay, honey.
Oh, damn, Toney, don't nobody wanna hear all that shit, man.
We having a pleasant barbecue.
And besides, ain't nobody gonna be getting called "boy" on my set.
Hey, look now. If we gonna do this shit,
we gonna all have to chip in together and help out.
Now, Toney, your receipts always add up to the penny, man,
so you gonna be in charge of the money.
Jimmy, your act got all them great props and costumes,
so you gonna do all that shit.
And, Ben, you write the funkiest songs, so will you please do the music?
But, um, who gonna write this movie, Rudy?
'Cause at the Oscars, they always say, "It starts with the word."
'Cause at the Oscars, they always say, "It starts with the word." So who gonna write that word, Rudy?
My baby!
The needle took my baby!
Sweet Jesus, when will this stop?
I'm gonna kill that pusher.
-I'm gonna make him pay! -No!
More death won't solve our problems!
Well, then what will, Mom?
[woman] I am not about to lose another son.
What, you gonnna sit here and pray? And cry?
That's what made him turn to that junk in the first place.
Keeping it inside.
It wasn't about the text, it was about the emotions.
Hey, sister. Sorry to bother you. You is a bad motherfucker.
What you did tonight, I really enjoyed it.
-Oh, thank you. -Some of the best acting I seen.
I'm trying to find Jerry that wrote the play. Where's he?
Uh, right here. I'm Jerry.
Hey, man! How you doing, brother? Good to meet you.
Yeah, I called you just recently, and I sent you some of my albums.
-I'm Rudy Ray Moore. -Yes. Oh, yes, yes. A pleasure, Mr. Moore.
Yeah, man. Look, I ain't even know about  this theater. It's mighty fine, though.
A lot of talented brothers and sisters wanna act,
but nobody's hiring them, know what I mean?
No TV, no movies. So this is where they come to show off their craft.
That's beautiful, man.
So, regarding your albums.
-Right. -I gotta be honest. I listened to them.
They're not really my bag.
Oh, well, brother, you ain't got to be funny.
All I want you to do is write a story for me, all the things that happen.
The good guys and the bad guys, the cops and robbers. Them kinda things.
-I'm gonna supply all the comedy. -Oh...
I can be humorous. But my work has to inform as well as entertain.
For example, my next play is called The Devil's Cotton Field.
It's a piece of black history set in the country town I grew up in.
It's a piece of black history set in the country town I grew up in. It's called Varner, Arkansas.
Varner. You from Varner? Shit, I'm from Fort Smith, nigga.
-All right, we got something in common. -What, that we're both from Arkansas?
That we both knew to get our black asses out of Arkansas.
Ain't nothing but canned mutton in that motherfucker.
You got that right.
Rudy, I admire your tenacity, but... I'm about my art.
I write my plays, I teach at an acting school.
-I'm trying to uplift the community. -Come on with all that bullshit, man.
We both left Arkansas for L.A., and we doing the same hustle now.
And I dig what you're doing here.
This is beautiful, bringing the people together and all that.
That's what I aspire to do. But I'm talking about something bigger.
I'm talking about the opportunity to get your message to all the people
through movies.
Jerry Jones movies.
We want this thing to be raw. Tell it like it is on the streets.
Yeah, lots of pimps and whores and cussing and all that shit.
And kung fu, karate. Brothers love all that kung fu.
Gotta have all the kung fu and karate and that Bruce Lee shit. They love that.
I'm sorry, do-- do you know karate?
No, but I'm a fast learner. I can learn how to chop me a motherfucker!
You know what we should have?
A all-girl kung-fu army.
-Um, you know, there's... -[kettle blows] ...there's plenty of story opportunity, Rudy.
Across this nation, inner cities are bein' plagued by violent crime.
-I feel the government hasn't stepped up-- -That's it. It's whitey's fault.
It's a corrupt government. They corrupt.
The motherfucker don't care about the people. The mayor is corrupt.
He one of them Nixon motherfuckers. And there's a exorcism.
-Goddamn it, an exorcism? -Yeah, you know, all that...
-Goddamn it, an exorcism? -Yeah, you know, all that... [growling] "Your mother sucks cocks in hell."
They love that shit. That's they favorite dish right now.
Okay. Um, I don't know how that fits into our urban motif.
Maybe you're right. I don't wanna be cleaning up green vomit off the set.
We'll put the devil in another movie.
Rudy, um, in storytelling, it's always best to, um...
you know, write what you know.
Now what do you mean when you say "write what you know"?
What do I... I mean...
You've lived a life, you know? You-- Things you've done.
So you tell stories about your own experience.
It ain't nothing talk about my personal life whatsoever, man.
Nothing interesting happen there. I deal with the professional.
-Okay, good. -Yeah, that's the night life.
And it's clubs and club owners and promoters and mobsters, and the money be disappearing all the time,
and mobsters, and the money be disappearing all the time,
and you got the pimps and whores turning tricks in the walk-in freezer.
That's good.
Okay, then.
Yeah. We could use all that.
Look at the titties on her, man.
[Rudy] Yeah, man, she talented.
You ain't lying.
Any of you boys interested in a dance?
Oh, no, mama. We here casting for my new motion-picture film.
No! No, I ain't doin' no porn.
You porn motherfuckers always coming down here--
Woman, I'm making a motion picture, and I want you to be in it.
Now, nudity is required, but so is talent.
Talent?
[Jimmy] Yeah, yeah. Take two dollars, put some air in that ass.
Say, Rudy. Hey, that's D'Urville Martin.
That ain't no fucking D'Urville Martin.
What would D'Urville Martin be doing in here, man?
Who's D'Urville Martin? Oh, you know. That sidekick nigga that did, uh... Nigger Charlie.
Oh, you know. That sidekick nigga that did, uh... Nigger Charlie. He did Black Caesar and Hell Up in Harlem. You know him.
-He's sitting right over there? -Yeah.
-Hey, that is D'Urville Martin. -Nigga, I told you.
D'Urville Martin? I'm Rudy Ray Moore. You probably don't recognize me,
'cause I usually have on my album covers a big afro wig,
and sometime I don't wear anything.
Oh, well, that must be it, then.
Hey, man, what I'm offering is a professional situation here.
I'm offering you a role in my new motion-picture film.
Ahh. What's the part?
It's actually not written yet, brother, but we're open to your input.
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
I am legit, man.
I have an agent.
-I have a entertainment lawyer. -That's right.
You just thought you was gonna walk up in here and make a deal, huh?
Just because you lucky enough to find me in the strip joint.
-Nah, nah, nah. -You know what they say, brother.
Luck is where opportunity meets preparation.
What the fuck is that? Hey, look here, man. Look here.
If I was white, you think you could just walk up here and hire me?
No.
I've been directed by Roman Polanski.
-Rosemary's Baby. That's what it is. -Yeah.
-You goddamn right. -You were the elevator operator.
-Yeah. -[Ben] Yeah. A small part. A small part. You been working for that white man. You need to be careful--
A small part. You been working for that white man. You need to be careful--
White man? I got your white man swinging--
Calm down, baby. Calm down.
-Don't worry. It's okay. -Hey, looky here.
These guys with you?
Yeah, man. We the producers.
Mm-mm-mm. Well, looky here. I'm-a tell you something.
It's okay, baby.
You motherfuckers are the worst producers I have ever met in my life.
Think you can just walk up in here,
engage an artist's talent with belittlement?
Insult?
-Get to truckin', baby. -Trucking.
What if we let you direct?
We have got the great D'Urville Martin directing and co-starring.
We got Jerry Jones writing the script,
and Ben E. Taylor done put together a theme song for me
that's badder than Superfly and Shaft put together. Listen at this here.

Uh, Rudy, you're very persuasive. We admire your passion. You gotta understand, Rudy. You're not just asking for a loan here.
You gotta understand, Rudy. You're not just asking for a loan here.
You're asking for an advance on future royalties.
We'll do it, it's no risk to us, but if you blow it,
we're gonna own your records till the end of time.
Well, I know all that, but...
I'm gonna bet on myself. Ain't nobody gonna put me on the screen 'cept for me,
and everybody I talked to say they wanna see a Dolemite movie.
Well, you understand you're not supposed to make a movie
for the five square blocks of people you know.
Well, that's fine with me,
'cause every city in America got them same five blocks,
and those folks is gonna love it.
This is the spot?
Behold. The Dunbar Hotel.
Behold. The Dunbar Hotel. Holy shit.
-This place is overrun with junkies. -But we gonna clear 'em all out, man.
-This place is overrun with junkies. -But we gonna clear 'em all out, man. Look, they had Universal Studios, you got MGM Studios,
Look, they had Universal Studios, you got MGM Studios, and this is gonna be Dolemite Studios.
-What? -Yeah, man. Look at this.
It got rooms for days. It just keeps all over the place. Look at that.
Everything we need. We could build all our sets here.
We could do Willie Green's massage parlor, Queen Bee's whorehouse.
Man, they even got a fucking club in here.
-Rudy, you can't afford this place. -I ain't gonna buy it.
I ain't gonna have to rent it, neither.
I went to the landlord and found out that he got the BVDs up his ass
about all these dopeheads in here. I offered to clear 'em all out.
I said I'd come on and do it for free as the caretaker.
[Jimmy] Get that mattress up there
and get that blanket up off there and get all that.
Get all that dust and shit up off the ground, too.
Y'all left a whole lot of shit up there up on that counter.
Did I ask about the dough I never got?
One, two.
Uh-uh. We ain't going shoppin'. That's for the movie.
Come on now. Put that shit back on the rack.
Hey, make sure you do the Dolemite bedroom on the second floor.
Make sure you do that kind of stylish.
With red carpets and red drapes, red bedspread, you know?
Make it real comfortable in there, too.
'Cause after we shoot in the day, I'm gonna be sleeping in there.
-Come again. You gon'-- -Man, after I pay for the film and camera,
I can't afford my apartment no more. I got to move in this motherfucker.
-You said we were going to a sound stage. -I know. I--
I don't know what the hell this is.
-Jerry. -Hey, you made it. [laughs]
Hey, Rudy. Rudy, man, these are the kids I was telling you about.
-Oh. -Good to see you, Nick. Glad you made it.
[Nick] Hey.
Dolemite is my name, and fuckin' up motherfuckers is my game.
Oh, right. Right.
Nick von Sternberg is my name, and UCLA Film-- Film School
is the place that I-- It's my school.
-Jerry I met at the acting class. -[Jerry] I was his acting teacher.
I gotta tell you, you gotta see this kid's short films.
He's amazing, man. Outstanding.
He look like one of them Alfred Hitchcock motherfuckers.
That's very kind of you. Um...
um, currently, though, we're looking for the-- the UPM or an AD.
I'm curious, are we filming on Panavision or Arri?
Oh, son. [chuckles]
We don't know all that technical stuff. We don't know a lot about that stuff.
We got a really dedicated crew here, you know,
but the truth is, ain't nobody been on a movie set before,
so we don't know all that technical stuff like lights and sound and camera.
-You know, we don't know that. -Of course.
All right, let me show you Dolemite Studio.
Come on over here. Look at Dolemite Studio, y'all.
This where it all happen. Yeah, this the epicenter, nucleus.
Why we need these white boys tellin' us what to do?
Use your head, Ben. Don't none of us know what the fuck we're doing.
If we're gonna make a movie, we need movie people.
Don't matter if they black, white or polka-dot.
Well, I ain't takin' orders from them.
You don't have to. You're the caterer. So just feed the honkies, okay?
You're welcome, sweetie.
Mirrors on every wall. Where am I supposed to hide my lights?
Ceiling is eight foot tall. This is... This is impossible.
Nick? There's no juice.
Okay, check the downstairs panels, see if there's juice down there.
Oh, no, no, no. Ain't no electricity.
Ain't no running water, neither. That's how I got a good deal on this building.
So how do I power my lights, Rudy?
Why come somebody can't just climb up this pole here and steal it from next door?
[whispers] Rudy. Rudy.
Is that the DP?
-Is that the what? -The DP. Director of photography.
Oh, yeah, that's him. That's our director of photography.
How old is that cat, man?
I don't know.
Sixteen.
-Twenty. -Oh, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.
Do you have any idea what you doing, man?
Look, man, you need a DP that knows how to shoot black peoples.
Whoa. Whoa, man. That's some racist shit you talking about.
No, it's not. It's not racist. It's a fact.
Look, look, look. Black people absorb light.
White people reflect light.
This is cinemagical reality.
Another reality is this room is giving me a headache. What else we got?
-[Jimmy] Oh. -[Rudy] Shit.
Goddamn.
[Rudy] Yeah, we gotta get these floors fixed, Jimmy.
I mean, is anything around here useful?
Anything?
Oh, shit.
-Yeah. -You did it.
All right, man, we in production.
[Jerry] It just feels like too much. There's a cop on every page.
-I gotta do some cuts. -All right, get some sleep.
[man] We'll take care of it tomorrow.
-All right. -We're gonna kill this shit tomorrow.
Absolutely. I'll see you tomorrow.
We gonna have a good first day tomorrow. Go get some sleep.
-Good night. -All right, good night, mama. Arigato.
'Night, man.
Ah, shit.
Rudy, um, I'm scared about tomorrow.
Oh, don't be scared. It's gonna be just like when we went up onstage.
No, it ain't, Rudy. I don't even like getting my picture taken.
I'm always trying to suck in my motherfucking gut
so I can look the best I can.
And I talked to that, uh, long-haired boy with the camera.
He said in the movies,
it's like they taking a picture 24 times per second.
-Yeah, but that-- -No, 24 times, Rudy?
And then that picture fucking lasts forever and ever,
long past you dead and gone.
I don't know about this shit, nigga.
"Twenty-four hours to get out of town, Willie Green.
Willie Green, I'm giving you 24 hours to get out of town.
And-- And 23 of 'em is already gone.
Willie Green, I'm giving you 24 hours to get out of town.
And 23 of 'em is already gone." That's good.
"You got 24 hours to get out of town, and twenty--
twenty-three--"
You got 24 hours to get out of town, and 23 is already gone, motherfucker.
Twenty-three is--
You dirty motherfucker.
You told me I wasn't shit, huh? You the one that ain't shit.
Look at me now, motherfucker.
Wanna know who I am? I'm Dolemite.
Fucking farmer.
Dolemite is my name, and fucking up motherfuckers is my game,
you no-business-born, rat-soup-eating, insecure motherfucker.
Dolemite is my name, and fucking up motherfuckers is my game.
No-business-born, insecure, junkyard-rat-soup-eating motherfucker!
So, how'd you find yourself on this production?
-Oh, well, actually, I'm Rudy's protegée. -Ah.
Yeah. I think, um, what they call in Hollywood, um...
an ingenue.
-Ah. -Yeah. Mm-hmm.
How did you become a part of this film?
Well-- [clears throat] I sort of specialize in playing the bad white guy around town.
-Mm-hmm. -All the black shows need a heavy.
I played the plantation owner at the Ebony Showcase.
I played a Southern lyncher at the Cultural Center.
And I played a rapist at the Wilshire Ebell.
Okay. So you just basically figured out what you're good at, huh?
This scene makes no fucking sense.
Why don't it make sense?
Why would the warden release the prisoner so that he can go undercover?
Because there is a drug issue in the neighborhood.
We're dealing with society. We're keepin' it real.
Aw, come on, man. Come on.
Look, you cats is pretending.
You pretending like the warden is a policeman, but he ain't.
Wardens don't investigate.
You forgetting that the warden is working with the governor!
-Thank you. -Who gives a shit?
How's it make any sense?
Because the governor is friends with Queen Bee.
Jibber. Jabber.
-What? -Jibber-jabber.
-How is it jibber-jabber? -How is that?
You telling me that just because the governor is tight with the woman that own the whorehouse
is tight with the woman that own the whorehouse
that he make the prison release her friend?
[both] Yes!
Fuck it. Y'all do what you wanna do.
-What do you think about the lighting? -Why don't we turn off all of the lights?
That way, we don't have to look at the scene.
-Hey, man, that ain't cool. -Ow. Ow.
I know you Mr. Big Time,
but the rest of us ain't never done no shit like this before.
I'm paying for this whole goddamn thing, and I ain't got no fucking ego about it.
If a box need to get moved, I will move the box,
and if the crew get hungry,
I go downstairs and start making sandwiches.
'Cause we are here to work together to make a movie!
It's cool, baby. No smoke, man. Everything cool.
Scene two--warden's office. Take one marker.
Action.
Sit down, Dolemite.
You know Mama Queen Bee here, I'm sure.
For damn near two years,
she's been bugging me about your innocence.
And you know the funny thing?
I believe her.
We've stumbled onto some facts that may set you free.
Now, you're a gambling man, aren't you?
It depends on the game, Warden, and how high the stakes are.
Well, I might as well level with you.
The game is rough, and the stake is your life.
Damn, that was so real!
You see how he was staring at me? I got a chill down my back.
Man, that was some good shit.
This gonna be a good scene. Man, I can't wait to watch this movie.
Hey, when can we watch the movie?
-Cut. -[Rudy] Cut!
-Cut. -[Rudy] Cut! Cut! Cut!
Scene three--take one marker.
-[clapper claps] -Action.
Hold it, Dolemite.
What do you want?
FBI.
What do you want, man? Where's your warrant at?
[man] This badge is my warrant. Open up the trunk.
There's nothing in my trunk, man.
Open the trunk!
[Rudy] That shit ain't mine. I don't know how it got in there.
You going to jail for a long time.
You gonna have to take me!
Cut! Cut. Cut.
Is there any angle that you could shoot this
where it looks like he's actually kicking him?
There's no such angle.
Roll it.
Action!
I don't understand this cat.
He pretending like he know karate.
Pretending like he could be a sex machine.
[scoffs] Like a little kid playin' dress-up.
-What planet is this cat on? -[Rudy] That's for fucking with me,
you no-business-born, insecure, junkyard-rat-soup-eating motherfuckers!
-[D'Urville] Cut! -[panting]
How was that?
I see no reason to do... it again.
Was it good as Shaft?
[Rudy] Come on, Jimmy. Go faster, man.
Come on, man. I-I borrowed this from my cousin off the lot.
-I told him I won't get a scratch on it. -Don't go scratching on it.
Just make it go faster, man. Come on now. We rolling.
-Big car-chase scene--take one! -[siren wails]
Rudy, I dunno nothin' about this stunt-driving shit, man. This a Cadillac.
Step on it and step on it quick! Burn some rubber 'cause we gonna deal with this prick!
Burn some rubber 'cause we gonna deal with this prick!
Drive, nigga, drive!
Man, that's it, man!
-[Jimmy] All right! -Drive, nigga, drive!
Drive, nigga, drive!
-They're going too fast. -We need the speed for the puddle splash.
Puddle splash?
Oh, shit! Oh, no!
-Oh, I'm brown sugar. I melt. -Perfect.
I ain't seen no puddle splash in the script.
Where's the puddle splash at?
♪ Hey, hey ♪
I've been wantin' to see me a honky dance.
-Please. Please. -Dance, motherfucker!
Take one marker.
I've been told beauty need to be in front of the camera.
-They about to blow the car. -They ain't gonna blow that up. Listen--
Going hot.
-Going hot? -Action!
Who's going hot?
He think he bad and ain't got no class.
I'm gonna wrap this shotgun up his motherfucking ass.
-Three... -Hot? What?
-...two, one! -That's my cousin's car.
Goddamn.
-Holy... -Shit.
-Bravo. -♪ Dolemite, Dolemite, Dolemite ♪
-Damn! -♪ Dolemite, Dolemite, Dolemite ♪
Fuck a dead duck!
-Payday, man. Have a happy Fourth of July. -♪ Dolemite, Dolemite ♪
-[man] Thank you very much. -Yeah, man. Happy Fourth.
Happy Fourth, man. All right.
[chuckles] Tomorrow's the big day.
What you talking about, Ben?
Tomorrow--your big sex scene.
You slick, man, putting that scene in the movie -just so you could fuck the white girl. -Don't be nervous.
[chuckles] Guess that's why you the boss.
Ben, you know, we ain't really fuckin'. It's, you know, pretend.
[Ben] Whatever you say, boss.
-Good night, Mr. Moore. -'Night, ladies.
Yeah.
Why in the fuck did Jerry have to put this sex scene
in the middle of this movie?
Because you the leading man, nigga, and you have all these half-naked girls.
Shit, the folks gonna wanna see you fuck one or two of 'em at least.
I could put my foot in somebody's ass, and I could be funny, but...
I ain't no Billy Dee Williams, you know? I got this big ol' belly.
Everybody gonna be standing around. I don't know what to do.
When my ex used to try to climb on top of me to bust a nut,
I would check the fuck out till the shit was over.
And in the meantime, I tried to amuse myself,
so I'd just pretend that he was fuckin' some mangy-ass donkey we had,
and I be just sitting there laughing and laughing...
and his dumb ass didn't even know the goddamn difference.
Lady Reed, that ain't help me at all.
I don't know. Maybe I'm just saying it don't have to be all sexy and serious.
You know, maybe it could...
It can be funny.
Exactly. It could be funny.
Sex scene--take one.
Act-ion.
Give it to me, Dolemite.
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
Dolemite. Oh.
Oh, give it to me.
Yes! Oh!
Oh, give it to me.
Oh. Oh, Dolemite. Oh, yes.
-Put your weight on it! -Ooh, Dolemite, give it to me.
Oh, Dolemite. Yes!
Oh, yes.
-Yes. -Put your weight on it!
Yes!
Blow that shit up.
Cut.
Yes!
What-- What happened?
I wrote a tender, realistic love scene, okay?
My whole goal with this movie was to tell it like it is.
[D'Urville] I dunno if it was tender, I dunno if it was sexy,
but it was funny as fuck.
Ooh, Lord.
-[man] Two! -[karate yells]
-Three! -Hyah. -Four! -Hyah.
Five.
-One! -Hyah. -Two! -Hyah.
-Three! Four! -Rudy? We-- We gotta talk.
-Man, I'm trying to memorize this kung fu. -I know. We got a real problem.
-[man] One! -[girls] Hyah. -Two! -Hyah.
-Three! -Hyah. -Four! -Hyah.
We ran out of film.
Man, what you talking about? What happened to all them little pieces?
I know. The short ends. We used them all and--
Look, I spoke to the crew. They've been working under their rate for a few weeks now.
They've been working under their rate for a few weeks now.
And I've been working for free for a few days,
and we're-- we're on your side, but if there's no film in the camera...

If this thing flops, you're working for free for the rest of your life.
Oh, like I'm-a be y'all's slave then, huh?
-Oh, come on. -Don't go there, Rudy.
You created this situation. Don't you go there.
Did you put in any contingency for overruns?
Editing? Post?
If that means mo' money, then, no, I'm busted.
But I can't go back there and tell 'em to stop now. It'll crush everybody.
Everybody put so much into this fucking movie, man.
I don't wanna let 'em down like that. Come on, man. We just an inch away.
Let us finish this fucking movie, please.
Okay, Rudy.
-All right. Okay. -Rudy. You all right?

You know, I worked with this actor once on Rosemary's Baby.
It's John Cassavetes.
He makes movies, too.
Down and dirty just like you, man.
Yeah, I get it, D'Urville. You big time.
Yeah, man, he put up his last dime to get it done.
Whatever it take to get it done.
Yeah, man, we gonna get it done.
No, look, man. You ain't listening to me.
Whatever you've been feeling about me, about the money men,
about anybody who's ever doubted you...
I want you to use it.
Connect to it, man.
Dig down inside, connect to it, and use it.
Put it on camera.

Oh, Lord, this was a living hell.
I don't know how I got myself into this, but they say sometimes you...

And that's exactly where I'm going. I just got a call from Black Caesar.
Fred Williamson. He's my friend.
We're gonna do a real movie.
Damn.
So I wanted to say y'all did a good job.
Crew, stunt peoples...

I'm going on now. I'll see y'all at the-- at the premiere. Okay.
No, no, no. Probably won't be a premiere, so...
-[Ben] Man, fuck him. -Yeah.
I like the movie.
Yeah, me too. Fuck, I think the motherfucker was a four-star.
-Rudy, you did it. We made a movie. -That's amazing shit.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's not over until you say, "That's a wrap."
All right, y'all, that's a wrap.
-No, no, no, no. -Give us a Dolemite wrap.
That's a motherfuckin' wrap!
That's a no-business-born!
Insecure!
Barnyard motherfuckin' wrap!
Yeah!

Congratulations, y'all. We made this motherfucking movie!
Comedian International. How may I help you?
Oh, no, Mr. Moore is available. One second, please.
Yes, this is Rudy Ray Moore. Who am I speaking with?
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Did you get a chance to review my production?
You did? Yes, okay. What--
Well, yes, it was a real movie.
It is a actual real movie, and everybody got paid, yes.
Yes, very professional production. Right.
No, I learned-I learned kung fu for the movie.
I didn't know kung fu before I started the movie.
Yes. Oh, no, you-- Yeah, you're right. This was Lady Reed's first production.
Right, this was her motion-picture debut.
Really?
Oh, well.
Well, you know, we was gonna do a fresh new edit on
and was gonna change a couple of things and a re-shoot for-for the ending.
Change the ending ar--
Right.
Okay.
All right, well, yeah. No, we totally understand.
Yeah, man, thank you so much for your consideration.
Well... at least we had a good time.
You know what, Ben? Fuck you, man.
Your ass had fun 'cause you ain't have to pay for all this shit.
I'm in debt up to my ears.
I gave all my record royalties to the Bihari Brothers,
and don't nobody want this damn movie.
Nigga, you got a whole lot of nerve
ordering a extra side of greens at a time like this.
Pay for these fucking greens yourself.
In fact, you're gonna all start paying for your own shit,
'cause I ain't no fucking endless faucet of fucking money.
Here, you pay for them waffles, you pay for that burger,
you pay for your shit, your extra greens, nigga.
You're having strawberries.
You pay for your motherfucking strawberries your damn self.
I don't understand your attitude.
I mean, it ain't like you ain't never been told no before, Rudy.
-I mean, you're the comeback king, man. -Yeah, when we doing stuff I know about.
Nightclubs and records. Those is my world, okay?
A man slam a door in my face, I just find another door.
Thought anybody could be a star.
But apparently don't nobody wanna see our ugly black ass up on the screen!
Strawberry shortcake-eating motherfucker.
-Hey, man, I like strawberry-- Rudy! -[Jerry] Come on, Rudy!
Yes, I was born in a barrel of butcher knives,
then shot in the ass twice with two Colt .45s.
Yes, I been slapped by a bear and bit by an eel.
I chew up railroad iron, and I shit out steel.
Yes, I was kicked out of South America for fucking steers.
I fucked the she-elephant till she broke down to tears.
I just can't believe I'm back here on this grind.
I'm actually worse off than I was before,
'cause I don't even own my records no more.
Now what kind of fool works so hard to build something up like that
and just throw the shit all away?
No, Rudy. You ain't no fool now. Watch your mouth.
I thought that movie was gon' change everything,
make me a fucking star.
Well, you're still a star to me.
[sighs] Okay.
Good night, Lady Reed.
Good night, Rudy.

All right, man. Really happy to be here today.
Now, Rudy, I gotta ask you this 'cause I'm a hell of a fan.
Yeah, man.
There's a rumor that you made a Dolemite movie.
Is that true? And if it is, when can we see this movie?
I wish I could answer the question, y'all,
but I really can't answer the question at this time, 'cause I just don't know.
You're not gon' give us nothing?

-That don't make no sense. -Yeah, but it's true. It's done.
Don't nobody wanna show the motherfucker. I don't know what to do, man.
[Bobby] You know what?
I got a cousin that manages a movie theater called Uptown.

I don't know. Maybe run it. Play your damn movie. Fuck it. Can't hurt.
And we are back.
Now, we don't have a midnight movie on Friday,

How does $500 sound?
That sounds fair. Perfect.
So, when can I receive my advance?
-What? Advance? -The money. When you gonna pay me?
No. You see, this is what they call four-walling.
Yeah. You pay me, and then you get all the ticket sales.
We did it with Billy Jack.
And I think we even did it with Grizzly Adams.
Man, you could clean up if you successful.
So I got to pay to show my movie?
Well, goddamn. Am I gonna get some of the popcorn money?
Oh, that's mine. But you get all the box office.
Now, if you promote the shit out the movie-- [laughs]

[Demond] Rudy.
I'm a little confused. Now, is this movie supposed to be funny?
I was expecting a Shaft kind of a thing.
Of course it's supposed to be funny. They get it. That's why they're laughin'.
It's a comedy and it's sexy and it's action.
It's a total entertainment experience.
He made me do it!
Bitch, are you for real?
Kill him, Charlie!
So I did good shit.

Well, I'm delighted to finally speak with you.
My name is Lawrence Woolner, and I run Dimension Pictures.
[Rudy] Dimension Pictures?
Ain't y'all the rat soup-eating motherfuckers that rejected me?
[Lawrence] Uh, that's right. That's right. We did, but, uh, well...
Hollywood is a fickle mistress, and we got a pitch for you that I...
I think is gonna knock you out of your seat.
Dimension Pictures International would like to buy Dolemite.
What?
Yeah, we got appointment.
Hey, so, what we supposed to say?
Nothing. Nobody say a fucking word. Just keep your mouths shut.
Only reason you're here is to make me look like a legitimate organization.
You got hot sauce on your shirt. Man, clean that shit off, nigga.
-Come on, get the shit together. -Okay, okay, okay.
It's cool.
Gentlemen, ma'am, we're thrilled to have you here.

This is Miss Reed, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Toney, and Mr. Lynch.

Uh, sorry, I'm confused. What is Generation International?
I thought you said your production company was Comedian International.
[Rudy] Comedian International is a subsidiary of Generation International.
Comedian International handles my live bookings and audio recordings,
things like that.
Generation International, they handle my cinematic output.
Okay, well... [clears throat] We're here to talk about your movie.
We think there's a golden opportunity here.
Look, one thing you need to explain to me is why for come I need you?
'Cause far as I can see, man, I'm doing pretty fuckin' good by myself.
Well, now, Rudy, there's a certain professional way to go about distributing a film.
there's a certain professional way to go about distributing a film.
We all know that there's a history of niggas making some art,
and the white man come along and steal all the money.
And y'all sure in the fuck ain't finna do to me
what they did to Chuck Berry, huh? Hmm?
[Lawrence] You know what?
You wanna do it your way, you go right ahead.
You go out there, you introduce your movie into every theater in the country.
You know, knock yourself out. You're gonna be releasing Dolemite for the next five years.
You're gonna be releasing Dolemite for the next five years.
But if you wanna do it right, well, here we are.
You know, hey... Now, we've passed once, so...
we fucked up.
-Damn right, you fucked up. -You knock it down.
That's the understatement of the year.
But allow us now to sell ourselves to you.
Dimension International-- we have two sweet spots.
Redneck pictures.
Right? Those are hillbillies and moonshine and sheriffs, and those play at the Southern drive-ins.
and moonshine and sheriffs, and those play at the Southern drive-ins.
Now, the second sweet spot is blaxploitation films.
It's films about blacks and for blacks. And you know where they play?
They play in the big beautiful movie showcases.
And every downtown has 'em.
They were built in the 1920s. They seat 2,000, 3,000 people.
They used to be very popular, but then the white audience, you know, skedaddled out to the suburbs.
but then the white audience, you know, skedaddled out to the suburbs.
And what's left? Well, the black urban audience.
Now, I'll tell you what.
If we book the right films, your film, these...
well, there is no other word for it, but resplendent movie palaces,
well, I think we can make a killing.
You know...
in my new movie, there's a scene where big bad Willie Green comes back to town, and my club is stolen.
where big bad Willie Green comes back to town, and my club is stolen.
Takes all my receipts and all my cash and all the girls.
Everything I been building up my whole life.
He comes along, tries to take possession 'cause he think I don't know no better.
But that's when I start to take charge...
and I start showing motherfuckers who's boss.
'Cause Dolemite ain't getting ripped off.
Can you dig it?
You gonna rip my guts out now?
We'll talk after the first profit statement.
All right now.
We gonna be on Dimension Films.
Dolemite's gonna be on Dimension Films.
Opening this Friday at the Avon Theater!
Opening this Friday night at the Moonlight Drive-In!
Opening Friday night at the Cameo!

You're not gonna believe who paid us back.
Yes, I put my finger in the ground and turned the whole world upside down!

Oh, yes, mama, we have. Yes, we have.
Oh, oh, Rudy, um...
I wanted to tell you something.
I just wanted to say that I'm so grateful.
I'm so grateful for you putting me in this movie,
'cause I ain't never seen nobody that looks like me...
up there on that big screen.
You know what I'm saying? Oh, shit.
I may not be sexy, but I'm a real woman...
and I really appreciate what you did for me.
So thank you.
[Rudy] Yeah, y'all ready to go? Put your weight on it!
Ooh, yes. All right. Look at this ad, Rudy! You looking hot now.
Aw, yeah. Put your weight on it.
That's what I'm talking about.
Hey, hey, I found a review.
What's that say?
Go ahead, man. Just spit it out.
Go on, say what is it.
"Dull-emite is a more apt title."
What'd you say? What'd you just say? "Dull" or "Dol"?
-Dull. -Oh, really?
Dull-emite. Dull-emite.
"This could be the lamest film of the year.
The plot is vague, and the actors scream their lines.
Its only touch of originality is in the introduction of...
the fat man as romantic hero."
-What's wrong with being portly? -Not a damn thing.
I don't see nothing wrong with adding a few extra pounds, personally.
-Exactly. Ain't nothing wrong... -Fuck them.
-...with being a little heavyset. -Mm-hmm.
[Rudy] That's just one review. What's yours say there, Jerry?
"Dolemite is dreadful, humorless, and a technically terrible movie."
Fuck that, Jerry, man. Critics don't know nothing.
I don't even know why they come in the first place.
They don't even like to have fun. Nobody care what the critics say.
And besides, everybody know when the brothers go to movies,
they wanna see car crashes, explosions, and titties.
-And we've delivered that. -Sho' did.
Look at this one right here. This is perfect.
"Dolemite isn't fit for a blind dog to see.
It is coarse, rude, crude, and vulgar." Perfect.
"Perfect"? But why in the world do you like that one?
That's gonna make people say, "I'm going."
They gonna wanna see just how coarse, rude, crude, and vulgar Dolemite is.
Hey, don't nobody worry about nothing.
No matter what happens, tonight is a victory already,
even if don't but five people show up.
Look how far we came.
We riding in a limousine on opening night to see our movie that we made.
I'm proud of myself. Y'all should all be proud of y'all selves, too,
'cause I'm proud of y'all, we family, and we did a movie. -We going to see our movie. -That's right.
[Rudy] We gotta make a promise to ourselves. -No matter what happens... -Mm-hmm.
...we have a great time.
-[Ben] Yeah, you're right. -[Jerry] Agreed.
-Okay. -All right.
-Yeah, Rudy. -Thank you, Rudy.
-You're already a winner. -We winners.
-That's right, we're winners. -Yeah.
-I feel good. -[tires screech]
-[man] What happened? What's going on? -Sweet Jesus.
-[Rudy] What happened? -Rudy! Rudy, look!
What's going on?
Hey, let down the window, man!
Holy fuck.
Oh, my God.
-Well done, everybody. Well done, Rudy. -That is some crowd.
Mr. Moore? Mr. Moore. It's an honor to have you here.
But we need to move you inside! We're not equipped for this kind of crowd!
It's crazy. So if we could just get you to move inside!
The four chairs to the right.
Rudy. Rudy. I am your biggest fan. I know. I have all your albums.
-Rudy. -This is crazy.
All right, let's all keep walking. We have to get started.
We already sold out the 10 p.m. and the midnight.
And I think we have to add 2 a.m. just to make everybody happy.
These people are gonna be here till 2 a.m.?
Oh, yes, sir. Your seat's down front.
Rudy, man. We gonna miss the opening credits. Come on now.
Come on, man. My song.
Give me a minute.
[man] Autograph?
-I wanna see the movie. -I don't know if we can see the movie--
Say, little man! You sure you old enough to be up this late at night?
Oh, he just won't stop talkin' about you.
-He always doin' your shit. -I love your rhymin', Rudy. It's so bad.
No, you the one's that bad.
I do your rhymin', just like Dolemite. But then I make it about me.
Oh, really? Let me hear what you got, boy.
You heard about Dolemite and the Titanic.
There's a new kid around finna be gi-gan-tic.
Young boy, who in the hell do you think you are
trying to topple the world's greatest star?
I use a earthquake to make a milkshake.
-Hey, that's my line. -I know more.
Mighty Donald is my name, and...
Fuckin' up motherfuckers is my game.
Boy, you got the gift.
Don't never let nobody tell you you can't be anything you wanna be.
-Understand? -Yes, sir.
Rudy, come on. The film 'bout to start.
Hey, Lady Reed. Why don't you go on and watch the movie? I seen it already.
These people gonna be out here till two o'clock in the morning,
and they came to see Dolemite, so...
I'm gonna give 'em Dolemite.
-All right? -All right.
Okay.
[crowd] Wow.
Hello, you motherfuckers!
-[man] We love you, Rudy! -Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
I just wanna say it's a pleasure to have y'all come out here tonight,
but I'm sorry to tell you, it's gonna be a bit of a wait!
But don't worry. Don't nobody leave,
'cause I promise you it's gonna be worth it!
'Cause like I always say, Dolemite is my name,
and rappin' and tappin' is my game.
Yes, I'm young and free and just as bad as I wanna be.
Take a look at me.
I'm a rare specimen of a man, don't you agree?
I want you to live the life that you love and love the life that you live.
From the frantic Atlantic to the terrific Pacific,
be the best of whatever you are.
Shoot for the moon, and if you miss it, cling on to a motherfucking star.
Dance!
Dance!
Drive, nigga, drive!
[Dolemite] I'm gonna let 'em know that Dolemite is my name, and fucking up motherfuckers is my name.
that Dolemite is my name, and fucking up motherfuckers is my name.
You're crawling in the wrong direction.
That wind you feel is coming from England.
Scotland's that way.
My lords.
I'm most sorry for making you wait.
I know you've traveled far and from great travail.
I pray you will know that this time of civil unrest...
consumes me... day and night.
I understand...
battle with the rebel Scots was hard fought.
It was, my liege.
-We lost some 300 men. -[exhales deeply]
Good Hotspur... you led the charge.
Were any prisoners of note taken?
Many.
-Are they in train? -No.
And why is that? Why have they not been brought to me directly?
Why will you not pay cousin Mortimer's ransom?
You'll need to speak up, my boy.
I'm an old man.
My ears... are filled with hair.
Cousin Mortimer is held by the rebels of Wales.
Why do you refuse to pay his ransom?
I refuse to pay Mortimer's ransom because I refuse to believe him a prisoner.
I rather believe Mortimer a traitor.
He has joined the Welsh rebels.
He has betrayed England and is now an enemy of mine,
and, therefore, of yours.
You agree with my précis, young Hotspur?
-No. -[Northumberland] My son--
I believe yours to be the ramblings of a crazy old demon.
Harry, please, stop this.
[King Henry IV] Oh, no, let him speak.
-I wish to hear him. -[Northumberland] My liege--
-I wish to hear him. -[Northumberland] My liege-- Yours are the ramblings of an old man so saturated with malice and mistrust
Yours are the ramblings of an old man so saturated with malice and mistrust
that he no longer knows up from down,
can no longer see beyond the walls of his own monstrous schloss.
My family have served you.
We aided you in your ascension, and still we fight for you. Cousin Mortimer has fought for you.
And yet, now, whilst you slobber over that chicken's wing,
he shivers in a western prison awaiting mutilation at the hands of Welsh witches.
[Northumberland] My liege... you must excuse my son.
He needs rest.
We come only... to advocate for your help in securing Mortimer's release.
All that we've done for you we have done for the good of England.
But our lands are now more riven with war than ever before.
The Scots aren't finished. The Welsh have only just begun. And for what?
Why do you think this might be, old man?
Who do you imagine might be to blame for this?
Chickens can't fly.
But I've seen one...
eke enough wing flap to clear a fence.
Then it's free.
But then so too are the foxes.
You are right, young Percy. I owe you much.
I owe your family still more.
But if the Scottish traitors you've taken prisoner are not brought to me as speedily as they might travel,
I will hang you by your fucking neck.
Has this been heard, young Percy?
Your Majesty, please forgive us.
What a venomous boy.
He'll betray me now. I'm sure of it.
If only he were my son.
[Falstaff] Hal.
[Falstaff] Hal?
Hal.
-[Falstaff grunts] -What is it? Falstaff has injured hisself.
Yeah. See?
-How did you get inside? -[Falstaff] The door was ajar.
It was not.
[Falstaff] Yes, it was. It was ajar.
It was not ajar.
Well, how else might we gain entry?
Are you accusing me of having cut myself a secret key?
Yes.
Falstaff has injured hisself, Hal. Will you perform the small repairs?
No.
[Beale] Oh, no.
Your Highness.
[grunts] There's a fresh coin in this for you, you know.
I don't want your coin.
I will require your undiminished loyalty from here till Megiddo.
You have that already.
You're a soft negotiator.
[yelps] Hey! You're wasting good wine.
-I'm keeping it clean. -Give it.
Oh. That looks very hot.
[Falstaff] Do it.
Prince Henry.
Who are you?
We come from the royal court. We wish to speak with you privately.
For what?
Please, sire. Privately.
Oh, privately, in the middle of Eastcheap?
Should I make a quick up and down and request a mass covering of ears?
Please, sire.
What is this?
Your father, His Majesty King--
Your father, His Majesty King Henry, is ill.
He requests your presence.
Hmm. I suggest you return to the palace directly and tell him his request was wholly ignored.
I've been instructed to deliver the request with great urgency.
You might tell him the urgency was also wholly ignored.
[whispers] My lady. My lady, it's time to leave.
-Why? -[shushes]
The day has begun. See?
-Out there. -[small exhale] It is well underway.
-[groans] -You might miss it.
Get up now. It's important that you leave.
-Up. That's the spirit. -[groans]
Now, lift your arms.
Very good.
You must get that door fixed.
What is it?
Visit with your father.
Go away.
If your father is indeed
gravely ill enough to request your presence, then you must visit with him.
It should be better to regret having done so than it would to have not.
If your father is ill, no matter your feelings for him, you must visit with him.
no matter your feelings for him, you must visit with him.
But...
I say this not out of concern for our king's well-being,
but more for fear of the drunken soak to which you'll be likely to succumb
should you fail to heed his call and he were to die
without you having squared your ledger.
I fear that would be soak enough to put even me to shame.
Do it.
If nothing else I ever suggest.
[archbishop] While I see the strain your treasury is under,
I cannot help but wonder if the canker of Lollardy be at the root of this suggestion that the church be burdened with a tax
be at the root of this suggestion that the church be burdened with a tax to relieve problems that are not of the church's making.
to relieve problems that are not of the church's making.
Your Majesty.
Henry, Prince of Wales.
[King Henry IV] My son.
Come in.
I feel my life nearing its natural end, and yet, still...
even I must appear of ruder health than you.
The time has come for us to consider...
the issue of...
my succession.
You will not be king.
While you are my eldest son,
for reasons that are on display for all here to see,
smell...
you will not inherit this crown.
Nor have I sought it.
That privilege and responsibility
will instead fall to your brother Thomas.
He is soft, but he is eager.
He will lead my army against the newly treasonous Harry Percy.
I will assume that this news comes as neither surprise nor disappointment.
But it is my duty as king,
and father...
to say it to you directly.
When do you fight?
I set off tomorrow.
We fight by week's end. You need not fight.
These feuds need not be yours.
[King Henry IV] I have said...
what you were summonsed to hear.
Leave us now.
-Your Highness. -Stop.
-Your Highness. -Stop.
Lord Dorset.
Are your men ready for the day?
They are, sire.
Very good.
Tell me of your preparations.
My lord.
Why are you here?
I will not allow this havoc to transpire.  I've come to see it stopped.
This is my battle.
If I have my way, there will be no battle.
You. Come here.
-[man] My lord. -You have no place here.
Go to the rebel camp, deliver the following message to Percy Hotspur.
Tell him that Prince Henry challenges him to settle today's score man on man.
He and I.
We will fight in our armies' places.
Yes, my lord.
Who do you think you are?
I am nobody to you.
I will fight him.
And I will defeat him.
That you surely would, my son.
But it cannot be.
The prince speaks not for his father.
You are eager to fight, my son.
And you will.
And we shall fight alongside you.
We will burn them.
We will burn Henry's reign to the ground.
-[Thomas] You have no place here. -You do not know war, Thomas.
-I do know war. -[Hal] You do not.
You've been recruited to our father's madness,
to wars that need not be fought.
These men are not our enemies. -Our father has made them thus. -[Thomas] Why then are you here?
-Our father has made them thus. -[Thomas] Why then are you here?
You so disapprove of our cause, and yet, still, you find it necessary to upstage me.
I do this not to steal your thunder, brother.
I do it to save your life. [man] Pardon me, my lords.
Our herald is returned from the rebel camp.
They have refused Prince Henry's offer.
They want battle.
Where is Henry?
I come to fight him in our armies' stead.
No.
His offer was refused.
The offer has been reconsidered.
I said... [shouts] no!
Why is the little dog barking?
[yells] Where be the big dog?
It will be done.
And here I am with the whoring fool.
This fight need not be had, Percy.
My father will soon be dead. Your grievances will die with him.
Don't be afraid of our small contest, young Hal.
I promise to finish it quickly.
Your father...
is plague to England.
Come for me, big dog!
Someday this will be your head, dropped at the feet of a man
Someday this will be your head, dropped at the feet of a man who might otherwise have been your brother.
Come with me now, Thomas, please.
Walk away from this field.
After you have stolen its prized scalp?
This is what will be spoken of tomorrow.
[sighs] This field was mine.
It was to mark my dominion.
Instead now...  it marks only this head.
This fucking head!
Move.
-[Hooper] John. -[groans]
John.
Go away.
You might want to see to your otherwise well-appointed friend.
He seems to have taken a pitiful turn.
[whispers] Beale.
Hal's up-chucked again.
Hello, friend.
Many times have I seen men in your state.
I've been in it many times over myself.
For all our rejoice of... courage and valor,
nothing stains the soul more indelibly than killing.
Never have I felt so vile... than standing victorious on a battlefield.
The thrill of victory fades quickly.
What lingers long after... is always ugly.
Never again, I say. [Hal] Stop talking, old man, please.
Please stop talking.
I will never stop talking, Hal.
Never.
Never ever.
[William] Out.
[William] My lord.
What business?
[William] It is a matter of great urgency.
Mm. You should hurry along then.
Please, my lord.
It is your father.
He's dying.
Hmm, that hook has lost its worm.
[William] Wait outside.
No doubt...
your father has brought... much trouble to this kingdom,
and I fear the chaos that might erupt in his absence.
England needs a king, and I suspect those sentiments of yours
that had you resile from him
are precisely those the governance of this land needs.
You must be king.
Why do you say this to me?
Speak to Thomas.
Is he not to be your new king?
I'm afraid that is not possible.
Your brother was killed in Wales.
After you defeated Percy Hotspur,
young Thomas pressed on to the western fields.
This is where he met his end.
It is said he gave valiant account of himself.
[Hal yells] Where is he?!
Where is the monster?!
Move. Leave him. The King needs rest.
-Soon he will have it. -He's dying.
Leave.
You feel this cold?
-Wretch. -[whimpers]
[weakly] Hal.
You must be king, Hal.
Please.
You must be king, Hal.
I know not what I have done.
You know not what will become of you.
So, I offer you this...
The most blessed reprieve,
the most dreadful misery.
You shall suffer the indignity  of serving me,
the wayward son you so revile.
But know now you will be watched over by an altogether different king.
What is this?
Who are you?
I am I.
Who are you? [Lord Chamberlain] What is your purpose here?
I think you just woke me up from it, didn't you?
Rise from that bed at once.
Who are you?
Where is Hal?
These lodgings and their contents are the property of the King of England.
You are trespassing and I order you to vacate at once.
What King of England?
Amen.
[archbishop] All hail King Henry.
[crowd] King Henry! King Henry! King Henry!
King Wenceslaus of Bohemia
presents this gift to King Henry of England.
To long and good health.
Beautiful.
I'm sure you all know...
my young sister Philippa has joined us here today.
Queen of Denmark.
I'm thankful she and her husband,
the good King Eric, have traveled all this way.
I wish for you take this vase, my dear.
Let its beauty stand for your beauty, which stands in turn for England's beauty.
I thank you, my lord.
[Lord Chamberlain] His Serenity, the doge of the Republic of Venice, present this gift in your honor, my liege.
-It says it is a bird from Constantinople. -[King Henry V] A bird?
-It says it is a bird from Constantinople. -[King Henry V] A bird? A dead one, I should suppose.
If I may, my liege.
Unnatural mechanics from the edge of Christendom.
[King Henry V] A wonder.
This belongs to my cousin, Cambridge.
Of all at this table, none have I known longer than I have you.
Indeed I have known you longer than I have my own young sister.
We were raised together. You're like an older brother to me.
So, I think it only fitting that you should have this magical bird.
Let's hope its magic isn't black and unholy.
[Lord Chamberlain] From the Dauphin, son of His Majesty, Charles, King of France.
A ball.
There is no accompanying message from the Dauphin?
No, my liege.
I shall keep this gift.
This one is sent only for me.
For the boy I once was.
The ball is an insult to you and to your kingdom.
You must respond.
Remember where, as prince, I whiled and how I spent my days?
[William] You spent them in considered privation.
Drinking, clowning.
So, is there not some truth in this jest?
If the Dauphin wants from me a paroxysm, why give it him?
It would not be a show of foul temper
for you to respond forcefully to an insult such as that.
It would be a show of strength. I appreciate your umbrage, William,
but my strength does not lie in me flapping up and down at the slightest barb like...
-some unholy mechanical bird. -Mm.
Make sense of this. This is what is pressing.
Civil strife has consumed us.
The war drains the purse like little else.
This strife must end.
And it will end... by conciliation.
We shall pardon our adversaries.
And we shall pay Mortimer's ransom and have him returned from Wales.
I will write these pardons in mine own hand.
I want it known these sentiments are so personal to me.
We shall let these men know they were my father's enemies, not mine.
[William] Certainly, my liege.
How does this strategy greet you?
Great reforms are best enacted with regime change.
If this is how you wish to proceed,
then, yes, my liege,
now is the time to do it.
Did you reconcile with our father before his death?
There was no reconciliation to be had.
He did untold harm to this kingdom. His death will bring calm with it.
I ask not after the kingdom.
What of you?
I want an end to this unrest.
Look around that table last night.
Look at the faces of the men seated at it.
I can feel this calm of which you speak.
I do believe they wish you well.
But I also see that they have their own kingdoms behind their eyes.
Do you understand what I say?
I've been away too many years and I'm now to return to Denmark.
But I have, in my time in that court, been privy to its commissions.
I have seen there, again and again, that no one ever speaks true, wholly true.
Choose your steps wisely, dear brother.
[archbishop] I speak to Charles of France's claim to be the legitimate sovereign ruler of said lands.
It is said that the Salic law would have no succession if the French crown fall to a woman.
Meaning, no rule left in the lineage of the female shall, by rights, pass to her issue.
shall, by rights, pass to her issue. Now, the law Salic, which is of Frankish land
and tethered to said lands is not--
not therefore legally bound or adherent at all, in fact,
to the lands of France, but to those of Francia,
which, as you know, lies between the rivers of Elbe and Saale.
I claim here, with proof, that hence it follows that the law Salic,
which has seen French sovereignty stolen as such from a true lineage--
Thrice, as I can illuminate, the French have cited the law Salic
-as reason to bar a female succession-- -With reverence.
Yes, my liege?
I'm finding this story impossible to follow.
My liege, I question the so-called French king's claim
to the throne upon which he sits.
Is that so?
What confuses me now is why you are telling me this story.
My liege, I simply aim to bolster your claim to France
should the need to meet her with force soon arise. And you believe that need will indeed soon arise?
I-- [chuckles]
My liege...
by way of preparedness, -I believe it always wise-- -Preparedness?
-I believe it always wise-- -Preparedness?
If we are to war with France, it will not come as a consequence
of an old and impenetrable madrigal.
France was your father's long-held ambition.
Had he not been bogged in civil feud,
he would most surely have taken the fight to her.
And then... on to Jerusalem.
Jerusalem?
We're all the way to the Holy Land, are we?
And presumably to sack the rest of Christendom along the way.
I am not my father, archbishop.
I would have thought this to be clear by now.
[William] We must forgive our archbishop.
He is a far... [exhales] far from gifted orator.
Which is strange, given I would have thought gifted oratory
to be a requirement of the position.
Why is the archbishop speaking to me of war with France?
What we are witnessing is a stirring, of which we must be wary.
I applaud... your restraint.
After so many years of strife,
you are proving to be more than your father's son.
You wish to be a king for the people.
Now, we must ensure to that end, however,
you do not remain oblivious to the mood of the people.
And what mood is this?
That France is taunting us.
Do you share this mood?
this mood is a fantasy.
But that does not mean it is not felt true.
-[Beale] Where are you going? -[Falstaff groans] Disgusting.
-No, we can't be going to Hooper's. -Yes, we can.
-No, she won't have you. -Yes, she will.
-[Hooper] Nope! -Yes.
-[Hooper] No. -Yes!
-You're not welcome here. -[grunts]
Unless you've come to pay me what you owe me.
[Falstaff] I have paid you.
You've paid me a snatch of what you owe.
And I presume, too, from the proceeds of thieving.
[Falstaff] Lies.
By all account, you be not specially good at thieving neither.
Lies.
How dare you address me so?
Why would you be so churlish with the very man most likely to lift you from your stinking rat hole?
with the very man most likely to lift you from your stinking rat hole?
Oh, maybe you've forgot.
My associations now stretch to the highest reaches of the realm.
Your insolence might as well be directed to the king himself.
Ponder that now.
[Hooper] Are you speaking of Hal?
Where is he?
-[Falstaff exhales] -Where is Hal?
Where's our king?
He be gone weeks and weeks now. Where is he?
-[clears throat] -I would say... -[sighs] -you be the one that's been forgot.
-Oh. -I would say that your dalliance with the upper reaches of the realm
was short-lived in and around his stinking sick bucket.
Seems you were little more than passing keeper of a prince's puke.
-[laughter] -Shut up.
Ponder that now.
Nell, Sir John is down on his luck.
I am not.
You find someone to pay your way here.
I'll not be paying it for you.
[man] Head.
[in French] Who are you?
He seeks asylum in return for his tale.
I do not doubt this can be arranged.
[in French] Can it or not? You are the King, no?
[in French] It can be arranged.
I have been sent by the King of France to assassinate you.
Charles himself sent you?
You know this to be certain?
[Gilrich] The order's origin I know, yes.
From the King.
What was the order?
That I should kill the King of England.
How?
There are many ways to kill a man. It is my talent...
killing men who do not expect to be killed.
[in English] At such a time as I endeavor to foster a fresh and peaceful air
[in English] At such a time as I endeavor to foster a fresh and peaceful air for this kingdom to breathe,
it is not in my interest to stir hostility with another.
This is an act of war.
[William] We share your longing for peace, my liege,
but to ignore such an audacious act of aggression
will be seen as weakness.
This is no game ball. This is an assassin.
Would you consider me weak, Chief Justice?
No.
No, I speak more of the kingdom.
What the kingdom sees.
What the kingdom sees. Mm.
How, pray, might the kingdom see the weasel beneath our feet?
If France's animus towards you
runs deep enough for them to send an assassin,
it will be felt in the street, ours and theirs.
It will be known.
We share your concerns. But peace today needs more than harmony.
It needs strength... and confidence.
These are qualities that can originate only in you,
the king.
Our king.
Take down these words...
addressed to King Charles of France.
This assassin you send
can be taken as nothing other than an infant act of war.
If this be your intention,
I say you let it be known plainly
and that you desist from this timorous slither
in which you presently engage.
If it be war you seek,
send the full weight of your army.
For a lone, cowardly assassin
will not topple this King Henry the Fifth of England
you so underestimate.
Fill this with gunstones and send it back to France.
-[Cambridge] Who is it? -A Frenchman, sire.
He says he wishes to speak with you privately.
About what? [man] He wouldn't say, sire.
I asked of him, he wouldn't say.
My king has sent me to seek out men he feels he can trust.
He believes there is discreet discussion to be had.
What discussion?
He believes there is discussion to be had about your new king of England.
[Cambridge] Only myself and Lord Grey were met.
We knew not where to turn about what was spoken to us.
[Grey] We're all of us aware there's a standing problem.
Our king is of low repute.
The French king... teaches you this?
Is he not thankful
for our young Henry's light reaction to his provocation?
The assassin he swears he knows not of.
'Tis a charge he denies.
His plot came to naught. Of course he would wish to wipe his hands of it.
[Cambridge] Whatever the root,
they have expressed grave concern
regarding our king's mental fortitude.
This envoy is to be trusted, is he not, Cambridge?
I believe so.
Charles wishes to dethrone our king.
The issue is not France.
This is but a reminder to us of a more general lunacy.
A boy who but weeks ago was a drunken boor
from the sewers of Eastcheap now wears England's crown.
-Hmm. -[Grey] What shall become of us?
What shall become of us when civil misdeeds are forgiven as if they were but indiscretions?
-When traitors-- -Yes, yes, Lord Grey, your--
Your concerns are current.
And they are numerous.
Something must be done.
Something will be done.
Give me quiet.
[William] Thus is a king's burden.
A king must make decisions
lesser men are... neither willing nor able to make.
A king is indeed presented with quandaries
lesser men might never encounter in the course of their whole lives.
I wish it were not so.
But problems...
And this is my experience.
Problems that are left unattended...
have a habit of becoming crises.
You have a chance here to unite the land, Hal.
Truly.
You have refreshed its mood with promise.
But promise must be fulfilled.
Promise can never be an end in itself.
As of this day, we're at war with France.
Twice I have given her the benefit of my doubt.
This third affront will not be left unchecked.
And so, in order to flush these French rats from their nests,
I will have it communicated to them that we are now at war.
My Lord Grey.
Cambridge.
I would ask you to deliver this message to France, given your...
familiarity with its recipient.
But I believe in the morning you be otherwise engaged.
Pray how, my liege?
Tomorrow you will have your heads cut off.
No.
I have chosen to send you as an advance party to Hell
for the considerable French number
that will soon be needing to find space there.
You were once my friend.
I am your friend...
cousin.
All leave.
Now.
You.
Stay.
You...
leave.
This is my place.
[King Henry V] The hostess can stay.
I will not jump to your attention.
[inhales] And surely not to retread vile ground I vowed never to walk again.
I acknowledge my neglect of you, John.
A new chapter of my life has begun before the last could be properly closed.
These concerns are mine and mine alone.
But the fact that this here be the first occasion
I've had to sound them aloud to anyone other than myself
speaks volumes.
It speaks to the loneliness of the position in which I find myself.
To steer our present course, I've been forced to rely upon the counsel of men
whose loyalty I question every waking moment.
Every waking moment.
I need men around me I can trust.
I'm here because you are my friend.
A king has no friends.
A king has only... followers... and foe.
I'm sorry my occasion to visit...
carries with it this doleful weight.
Hal.
I will come with you.
I ask only one favor in return.
[exhales] Square my account with that terrible hag...
over there. Would you?
[King Henry V] We welcome those newly arrived here.
Turn us now in common poise, with one mind, sharpened.
Together...
we will bring France down.
Together...
we will bring her to her knees.
Captains all, to this end,
I wish to introduce to you a new marshal of our campaign.
Sir John Falstaff.
Sir John's experience in battle should need no recitation. You know of him.
Some of you have had the honor  of fighting alongside him.
Others have heard tale of his exploits.
But I have tasked Sir John to join this campaign
for one most vital reason alone: he respects war
as only a man who has seen its most monstrous form can.
He lusts after it not, but rather regards it with the grim sobriety
that you and your men should hope he would.
Welcome, and thank you... [inhales] good sirs. You're all well met.
Very good.
Are you ready for what awaits us?
One is never ready for what awaits us.
[man] Get!
You believe Sir John there to be fit and suitable enough to captain this effort?
John is a good man.
[King Henry V] They meet us at sea or upon landing.
We shall know soon enough.
You must rest.
John.
Thank you.
What for?
For being here.
With me.
Well, it's a small price to pay
to keep that detestable Hooper woman off me back.
Get some rest too, my liege.
We land quickly!
[man 1] Check every building.
[man 2] No man!
[man 3] Watch.
-[man 2] No man here! -[man 4] Clear!
[man] Go on. Faster.
[man] Light.
Pull!
Pull!
[Dorset] We must storm that castle.
It will be bloody. We will most surely sacrifice souls.
Thus is the nature of war. It is bloody and soulless.
-[scoffs] -We have no way of knowing how well supplied they are behind those walls.
This siege may take months, and months, I fear, we have not at our disposal.
Men in these numbers, fixed here, will fall to hunger and disease.
Sir John.
War is...
bloody and soulless.
Yes.
The archbishop has arrived.
[archbishop] Surely you cannot simply idle here until they decide to come out?
That is precisely the definition of a siege.
How long might that take? Surely there's no way of knowing.
Uh, that too, is a common characteristic of a siege.
-I will not send my men up that hill. -But why in heavens not?
I will not sacrifice my men so flagrantly, nor so speculatively.
Well, then why do you not simply go around?
If they insist on hiding in their castle, why do you not simply go around it?
So well versed in the art of warfare.
[William] We must take this town, Archbishop.
We must establish a garrison foothold here...
for our lines of supply from England.
Do not forget that I have underwritten this campaign.
I have interest here.
And I will be heard.
Not today, Archbishop.
My liege.
They have surrendered.
-Our debate now, it seems, is for nothing. -Hmm.
As are the archbishop's bleatings.
[in French] The day is yours.
We ask only that our women and children be freed.
Many are hungry and wounded and becoming sick.
[in French] Upon full account of the castle, I see no reason to deny your request.
You will have tonight to oversee this evacuation
and to corral your men prisoners.
[in French] Come.
[Dorset] He wishes to slow us.
Who wishes to slow us?
We have received word that the Dauphin is en route.
He wishes conference with His Majesty.
And we know nothing of his purpose?
We know only that he desires conference.
I would hope his purpose be to deliver his father's early surrender.
I strongly advise we disregard this word of his approach and ready our movement.
We must make advantage of their disarray.
Sir John, your counsel.
I've never met the man... this French prince.
I can't speak to his motivation.
[William] My liege.
He's here.
Your Majesty.
To... your little... victory.
Do you wonder why I have come?
Do you wonder this?
I have not come to offer you surrender
if that is what you are hoping.
I have come to describe for you
your end days,
the screams of your men  as they die slow.
And so, King of, uh, England,
you seem so intent on making France your new home,
so let me help you.
I will drain your body of its blood
and bury it under a tree.
A little French tree.
Very young, very small.
Since perchance that is fitting of your mind for you to come here.
Small.
And maybe your...
I mean, no, your balls must be big, no?
Giant balls.
Giant balls... with a tiny cock.
And the sound of your wives and children weeping
shall lull me to sleep at night.
Have you heard what I said?
I have.
It was stirring.
Sir John, please walk with me.
Good night.
Ready the men to move.
Waste no time.
[boy] Run!
Hush, hush, hush. Hush. Hush.
Hello, little boy.
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.
I want you to deliver a gift to your king.
Will you do this for me?
Good boy.
[man] No!
Double the guards to 20 yards through the night.
Three hours at a watch.
I want these men fresh and alert. Any man caught sleeping will have his eyes gouged.
Any caught speaking will lose his tongue.
And I want all French prisoners in our train put to death.
Leave their corpses speared on pikes by the river's edge.
[Falstaff] The first command I'll heed.
The second...
you'll have to carry out that mass execution yourself.
What did you say to me?
You are not that man.
How dare you defy me? Show your feeling in here, with me.
-Don't let it outside this tent. -How dare you defy me? I am the king.
And where is the fearsome old warrior Falstaff about whom I've heard so much?
You've been mute since we crossed the sea.
I seem to be serving as my own chief tactician, my own commander, my own counsel.
Where is the fearsome old warrior Falstaff?!
I speak only when there's something to be said.
Too often have I seen men of war
invent work for themselves,
work that leads to nothing but vainglory and slaughtered men.
I'm not that man.
And this here is the war that you have chosen to wage.
I will disembowel you right here with mine own hand.
You are not that man, either.
[man 1] Evening, M'Lord.
-[Falstaff] Gentlemen. -[man 2] M'Lord.
Lord Dorset, summon your fastest rider.
My liege.
Dartmouth!
[panting] Sires. What can I do for you?
Tell me what lies over that hill. Ride fast, return directly.
We are both outnumbered and out-positioned.
They have the downslope in their favor.
Our need to advance puts us already at disadvantage.
The longer we wait, the larger their force will grow, and with it, our disadvantage.
Your archers, my lord, are of superior faculty.
French crossbow is no match for an English longbow.
We should hobble their number on first assault by these means alone.
York's charge in center faces four lines of mounted knights.
Our archers here might weaken those by half. But--
But not eight lines.
Nine. Ten. More. You speak true, my liege.
The longer we wait, the greater our disadvantage.
But it is possible our disadvantage has already grown insurmountable.
A great many men are already desperately ill
and weak from hunger.
What then, my lord, do you propose we do?
I propose we consider turning back, my liege.
[stammers] I know it will not bring the outcome we desire, but nor will the evisceration of our army.
I'm reticent to speak for others here now, but I'm certain my fears are shared.
Who here agrees with Lord Dorset?
You can win this battle.
[Dorset] Is that so, Sir John?
Yes.
And precisely how is that so, Sir John?
You fight without horses and without armor.
Heavens above, please spare us from this man.
[Falstaff] Their forward defense is a front line of mounted men.
Many deep.
Knights all.
All on horseback, all with heavy armor.
The ground out there...
is a flood bowl,
already half-sodden.
When it rains tonight, as I know it will,
that ground will turn into a muddy bog.
And with their horses and their armor,
they will get stuck, they will fall,
and they will flounder like upturned beetles.
As shall we.
Not if we travel light,
without horses and without armor.
Speed and mobility will be our advantage.
[Westmorland] And how, Sir John, can you be so sure of rainfall tonight?
My right knee is aching.
It only does that when rain is near.
Oh, save us, my liege. Please put a stop to this drivel.
This would require their armored front line come meet us in the mud.
How do you propose we invite that?
A small forward armored attack of our own.
A false advance.
They will counter.
We save our weight and our muscle  for a nimble assault from the flanks.
They shan't be so easily deceived. They will not respond to false attack.
They will respond.
We move, they will meet us in the mud.
Our men-at-arms are outnumbered. This they know.
They will hope to overwhelm us, so they will meet us with full force,
no matter how small our first advance.
Our great longbows will rain chaos on them from above.
That chaos will be your favor.
My liege, I implore you, we mustn't... we mustn't listen to this madness.
What is the true experience of this man?
He once fought for Richard many years ago. Since then, he has done nothing...
other than ride with the companies,
robbing and tormenting.
I never robbed anyone who didn't deserve to be robbed.
If it rains tonight,
we fight tomorrow.
If you have concocted this plan,  half-baked and speculative,
merely to prove to me your worth,
please say so now.
All plans are speculative.
And as I say, I only speak them when I feel them true.
This one I feel in my bones.
This one I feel in my knee bone.
Here we are on the eve of this fight, and I am...
I am scared to wonder, to tell it true,
why we are here.
You best discover the answer for that.
The men out there deserve it.
They've given their lives to you.
I cannot say what forces have conspired to bring you here,
but these men need you,
just as you need them.
These men deserve your confidence.
And if you cannot give them that,
at least then tell them a magnificent lie.
Though you might not think it possible...
you are my friend.
Good night, Hal.
Sleep well.
This wind whips from the north.
The rain was sent from England.
Why are you being fitted with plate? We were to fight without armor.
We need a front line to draw them in.
It cannot be you. [Falstaff] The idea was mine.
Some man must lead the first push to sell it well.
My men have been assembled.
And I cannot, in good conscience,
send them out there to realize my speculative drivel without getting muddy alongside them,  can I?
I will fight with you.
[inhales] It's noble, but you know that cannot be.
This is what I was built for.
I die here or... I die over a bottle in Eastcheap.
And I think this makes for a much better story.
And you have things still to do.
You will join this fight.
But promise me you don't join too early.
It doesn't matter what you see out there.
We must first draw them all in. All of them.
Promise me that, Hal.
Win, my friend.
Maybe then you'll lighten enough  to have a drink with me. Hmm?
[in French] Where is the Dauphin?
I humbly thank you for receiving me, noble lord.
[in English] Please. Please speak English.
I enjoy to speak English.
It is simple... and ugly.
I have been waiting all morning, all the night... for your surrender.
It might have saved a great unease
had it come sooner. I know you do not speak for your father.
I do speak for my father.
I know you do not speak for your father, so I come to you now directly.
I have not come to surrender.
Too much Christian blood will be spilled on this field today.
So, I propose this:
You and I fight, one man on one man.
We fight in our armies' stead.
If I lose, my men will leave this place  forthwith and forever.
You will have my head.
If I win, I will assume this kingdom's crown upon your father's death.
What say you?
Are you scared, young Henry?
What say you?
Are you scared of this battle?
There is no shame of it.
Save your men.
You save your own men.
You came here. To me!
[yells] Surrender to me!
I cannot do that.
[Dauphin] Well, then, boy,
let us make famous... that field out there.
This little village of Agincourt,
that will forever mark the site of your callow disgrace.
You expect of me a speech?
I have only one to give, and it is the same one I'd give
were we not standing on the brim of a battlefield.
It is the same one I'd give were we to meet in the street by chance.
I have only ever hoped for one thing...
to see this kingdom united under this English crown.
All men are born to die. We know it.
We carry it with us always.
If your day be today, so be it.
Mine will be tomorrow.
Or mine today and yours tomorrow. It matters not.
What matters is that you know, in your hearts,
that today you are that kingdom united. You are England.
Each and every one of you. England is you.
And it is the space between you.
Fight not for yourselves, fight for that space.
Fill that space.
Make it tissue. Make it mass.
Make it impenetrable. Make it yours!
Make it England!
Make it England!
Great men to it. Captains, lords.
Great men to it!
For the King and St. George!
Les imbéciles.
Archers.
[man 1] Archers!
[man 2] Archers!
[man 3] Archers! Now!
Draw!
Loose!
Halt!
Ready!
Loose!
On me!
Come then...
King of England.
Hail the King.
Hail the King.
Hail the King.
My liege.
-God save the King. -Hail the King.
Hail the King.
-Hail the King. -Hail King Henry. Hail the King.
[Westmorland] My liege. The prisoners we have took are a rabble.
I fear we will not secure them should their army regroup.
Kill them all.
[in French] Your Majesty... Henry, King of England.
[in English] Your Majesty... Come sit here with me.
Please.
I like to have the sun on my skin, but not too much.
Too much is very dangerous.
This conversation we are about to have...
has been had many times before,
and will be had many times again for centuries to come
between men of vanity and men of good reason.
I would hope that you and I are men of good reason.
I have, of course, traveled here to offer you my surrender.
Do you ask anything of me in return?
No.
I do, however, have for you a proposition.
You take the hand of my daughter, Catherine,
in marriage.
It is most uncanny...
that the great movements of history
so frequently find their origins in the minutia of family.
That in ways I dare not unsettle here,
my relationship with my son
and yours... with your father.
These are the things that have led us here today.
We are leaders of lands and peoples,
and yet... it is family that moves us.
Family... consumes us.
My condolences to you...
for the loss of your friend, Sir John.
I know you must feel this loss deeply.
Thank you, William.
Your loyalty to me has been comforting.
You have proven yourself to be a most worthy king.
I would say you have proven yourself to be one of England's great kings.
[Lord Chamberlain] Your Majesty, the crowd has gathered.
So I hear.
Please sit, Your Majesty.
[in French] You are beautiful.
Merci.
I will no longer speak French.
We must speak English. I cannot speak English.
You will learn.
I wonder, then, how our union might proceed in the meantime.
[in English] There is much I wonder about a great many things.
[in English] Indeed there must be for you to contemplate marriage to a woman about whom...
you know so little.
I will not submit to you.
You must earn my respect.
I understand that.
Do you? I do.
Do you feel a sense of achievement?
In what regard?
In any regard.
I have achieved that which my father never could. I have united this kingdom in common cause.
You have achieved momentary respite.
A unity forged under false pretense
will never be a unity that prevails.
How, pray, have my endeavors been forged falsely?
Why did you bring war to France?
Your father came on spoiling.
How so? How was he spoiling?
He sent an assassin.
There was no assassin.
There was no plot to kill you.
How might you know?
Because I was with my father when he received word of your charge.
I know him well enough to know his reaction to be genuine.
How was his reaction?
He laughed.
He laughed very much. He said you must be drunk.
Your father is a madman.
He may be mad, but he is true.
His madness makes him true.  He says only what he believes.
That is why he is loved.
The assassin then was sent by your brother.
-My brother? -Mm-hmm. My brother was too stupid to conjure such a plan.
What was your true reason?
Did you know of the ball he sent?
The ball he sent to me?
A ball?
He sent to you... -a ball? -Why should you question my intent?
Your father's rule is illegitimate. He has no right claim to his throne.
All monarchy is illegitimate.
You yourself are the son of a usurper.
It would seem that you have no explanation for what you have done.
You have shed the blood of so many Christian souls, and yet...
before me now, all I see is a... young and vain and foolish man
so easily riled.
So easily beguiled.
I must leave you now.
[William] Gentle.
We must be sure to revel in this day, my friend.
A crowd has gathered in honor of our victory.
These are the rare moments for which a king truly lives, I would imagine.
In all my preoccupation, I have... neglected to ask after your family.
Your preoccupations are hardly trifling.
You have two sons.
I do.
[King Henry V] And...
your wife minds your estate in your absence.
[William] She does.
Yours is sheep.
You're a man of wool.
As was my father before me.
How many head?
At last count, some 4,000. Mostly Dorset Horns.
How much land have you?
To be true, I'm not... wholly certain, but...
but many... many hundreds of beautiful, beautiful acres.
What lands in France have you now annexed?
[William] Stop.
Now that France is ours, how much of her land is now yours?
Oh, well... That has yet to be determined. [chuckles]
Your conquest is so recent.
-Why do you ask this question-- -Stay up there.
-Hmm? -Stay up there.
How did my assassin come to you?
I fail to remember the moment.
Remedy this failure.
So much has happened  in the intervening months.
An event as pivotal as this one should be amply equipped to penetrate the fog of time elapsed.
No?
Of course.
Let me recall.
Was it in the street?
Did he come to you in the street?
Yes. Yes, it was in the street.
He approached me... [inhales] most unusually.
My liege, please, tell me the cause of this concern.
Stay up there.
Stay up there.
Did he know your name?
I don't believe he did.
How, then, did he know  who you were to approach?
The memory is returning.
He surrendered himself to palace guards
and the matter was brought to my attention. I was taken to him.
So, he did not come to you in the street.
No. No, it was not in the street. Forgive me.
I was summoned to his cell.
Has a problem arisen...
Hal?
Yes. A problem has arisen.
And it wobbles before me now  on its silly little stool
-at mine own elevation. -I'm afraid I don't understand.
-Please, please, stop this charade. -Sincerely, I do not understand.
[yells] Stop the fucking charade! Stop it!
[yells] I have given you what you wanted, boy!
Have I not?!
You wanted peace. [yells] Did you not?!
This is how peace is forged.
It is forged in victory.
Listen.
That is the sound of peace.
That is the sound of your peace.
That is the sound of your greatness.
I ask nothing of you...
only that you will always speak to me clear and true.
Always.
Will you promise me only that?
-[crowd] Long live the King! -I will.
Name?
Chowdry.
You there... they want you in the Governor's office.
Ah! Mr. Karim!
I wanted to speak to you about the carpets we sent to the British Exhibition.
-There is a problem, sir? -No, no.
The carpets went down very well.
In fact, the Governor General has received a letter from the Royal household
thanking him personally.
It's all been such a success, he has decided
to present the Queen with a "Mohur" as part of the Jubilee.
A "Mohur," sir?
A Mohur.
Apparently, it's some sort of ceremonial coin.
I have been asked to find someone tall to present it.
You're the tallest person here.
When will she be arriving, sir?
Not in Agra...
In England!
You will travel to England
and present the Mohur at an official function.
Like an equerry.
On a horse?
Karim, I don't think there'll be a horse. [chuckles]
Equerry always has a horse, Mr. Tyler, sir.
Well, maybe not like an equerry, exactly.
Morning!
Ah! Morning!
This is Major Bigge...
Extra Groom-in-Waiting to the Royal household, Windsor,
who will be in charge of your journey.
-This is Abdul. -Top-hole!
And this is Mohammed,
who will also be presenting the Mohur.
He's very short.
We had to swap him at the last moment.
The tall chap had an accident with an elephant.
[Mrs. Tuck] Good morning, Your Majesty.
[Major Bigge] At the head is the Lord Chamberlain,
then the Private Secretary, the Deputy Private Secretary,
the ladies-in-waiting, the upper servants, the lower-upper servants.
Then the members of the household.
One, the Head of the Bedchamber. Two, the Personal Head of Staff.
Three, the Butler in Chief, who is in charge of the Household Butler,
the kitchen factotum, the Head Chef, the head of waiting staff,
the ordinary waiting staff, Windsor, the table maids,
then you. Any questions?
Uh-huh. Who will have the Mohur, sir?
I'm not exactly sure as yet.
I suspect you'll both carry it on a cushion.
Do we both get a cushion?
I really don't know.
The key to good service is standing still and moving backwards.
The most important thing is you must not look at her.
What an arsehole.
Have you any idea how cold it is in England?
We're gonna die there.
Why did you agree to come?
The tall one fell off an elephant.
I wasn't given a choice.
Ugh! Five thousand miles to present a bloody medal
to the oppressor of the entire Indian subcontinent.
You don't realize what a great honor this is for us.
Have you ever tasted English food? They eat pigs' blood.
-They do not eat pigs' blood. -I'm telling you.
They put pigs' blood in the sausages and brains of sheep.
The place is completely barbaric.
[beggar] Give me some money.
Please, sir.
Civilization!
-Please, somebody. -Give us a farthing.
Give us a farthing, sir.
Arms.
[tailor] Arms.
We copied them from some drawings in the British Museum.
Splendid!
You do know a sash is not traditional, sir?
The Indian drawings didn't look very... "Indian."
So we made some innovations.
The important thing is to look...
authentic.
[Major Bigge] Looks jolly good to me.
[Sir Henry] Jubilee celebrations. Nine o'clock, breakfast in London.
Quarter to 10:00, changing of the guard.
Eleven o'clock, meeting with the Swedish Ambassador.
Twelve o'clock, luncheon with Oscar II, King of Sweden and Norway,
the Norwegian Ambassador, the Chief Under-Secretary of State
for the Southern Norwegian Provinces,
the Junior Under-Secretary of State
for the Northern Norwegian Provinces.
Two o'clock, ceremonial drive down the Mall.
Half past 2:00,
tea party at Hyde Park for 30,000 children.
Half past 4:00,
Household departs on the Royal train for Windsor.
Half past 6:00, dinner in the Great Hall.
[Major Bigge] Come on, men! Chop, chop!
[Sir Henry] And the ceremonial presentation
of a Mohur.
The Hindus, sir!
[Alick] But they're completely different sizes.
There was an incident, sir, with an elephant.
[Alick] The Queen arrives.
Fanfares.
Ceremonial entrance.
The Royal Entourage make their way to the table
to be seated thus.
Her Majesty.
Sir Henry Ponsonby, Private Secretary, the Secretary of State for India,
Sir Henry Ponsonby, Private Secretary, the Secretary of State for India, the Emperor of Russia, Dr. Reid, Lady Churchill, Miss Phipps,
the Emperor of Russia, Dr. Reid, Lady Churchill, Miss Phipps,
et cetera, et cetera.
Grace.
Soup, potage Saint-Germain with purée de madeleine.
Fish course, morue aux huîtres.
Fanfare.
Entrée, quenelle with regency sauce, et cetera, et cetera.
Dessert, pain d'épinards,
tartelettes à la suisse, profiteroles.
Always profiteroles.
You will come from the northwest service entrance.
Process together.
And you will stand here.
No!
A little bit. That's it.
Presenting the tray thus.
Tray?
I thought it was a cushion.
-You will present the tray-- -[Mohammed] Excuse me.
Do I get a tray?
No. We've only got one tray.
Uh-huh. So, what do I do? You'll just have to improvise.
Whatever you do, you must not look at Her Majesty.
You will bow again. Then moving backwards,
you will turn to your left, you will lead thus,
and you will process down the hall
to be met by Mr. Bigge,
who will walk you to the north wall, where you will stand
till the end of the meal.
Would you like me to run through that again?
Mr. Yorke, she's heading to Paddington!
[gasps] Everybody out!
You two, stairs, now!
Jesus Christ! Where are the quenelles?
Oi, you two,
out of it!
She's at the station, sir!
Jesus H. Christ, she's at the station!
For God's sake, just wait where you were told.
Open the door.
Open the doors!
Open the doors!
Open the doors!
She's here.
Soup.
Soup!
Soup! Soup!
Soup!
Soup!
[sighs] Thank heavens!
Soup, Your Majesty.
[woman] What, are you taking it all?
I haven't finished yet.
I'm afraid you have to be quick.
They take it off you as soon as she's done.
One down, six to go.
The morue aux huîtres, and then the quenelles.
Yes, sir.
"The morue aux huîtres, and then the quenelles."
This is bloody ridiculous.
Two months in a boat, and I haven't even got a tray?
[guest] Yes. Apparently you have to chew it 32 times.
I have the Mohur.
Is that it?
Your Majesty?
Your Majesty?
The, uh...
The profiteroles.
[Mohammed] Is that it?
Profiteroles have gone.
Gentlemen, process, turn, bow, present,
and absolutely no eye contact whatsoever.
[Sir Henry] A gift from the Indian Empire.
A Mohur, Your Majesty.
A what?
A Mughal coin, Your Majesty.
In honor of your service to the subcontinent.
Have we finished?
Uh, we still have coffee, Your Majesty.
Eyes!
Good morning, Your Majesty.
[Sir Henry] Breakfast with the Royal Princes of Belgium.
Eleven o'clock, an audience with the Sultan of Dubai
where Her Majesty will be presented with the Diamond of Ooojay.
Garden party where Her Majesty will receive
Oscar II, King of Sweden and Norway, again.
And Queen Liliuokalani.
Who on Earth is she?
A monarch and sole Queen Regnant of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Your Majesty.
Uh, she has composed a song for you.
On the ukulele.
But we have managed to put her off.
Then you will eat with the Prime Minister, and, at seven o'clock,
the banquet in the State Dining Room.
And your movements, Your Majesty?
Nothing to speak of, Dr. Reid.
Not even during the day?
We last moved on Sunday evening.
I fear these celebratory dinners are taking their toll, Your Majesty.
Might I suggest some Benger's mixture?
I refuse to eat Benger's. It's baby food.
But it is imperative, Your Majesty,
that the Royal colon receives a little roughage.
Anything else?
[Sir Henry] Um... Was Your Majesty pleased with the Mohur?
What?
The Mohur. The ceremonial coin.
Presented by the two Indian servants.
I thought the tall one was terribly handsome.
Stop!
Slight change of plan.
You must not talk to any of the guests.
Nod or bow, but, please,
do not interact with anybody other than the serving staff.
I will come to you when the Queen is seated,
and you will present the Royal pudding as requested.
Excuse me, sir...
But what is it?
That is a jelly.
A pudding made from the liquor of fruit.
How do they get it so stiff?
Gelatine, a by-product of cow bone.
Barbarians!
[Lord Salisbury] There's another famine in India.
More trouble in Ireland, I'm afraid.
Suez is a perennial nightmare.
And I'm afraid the Boers are at it again.
Is there any good news, Prime Minister?
Well, we've decided to annex Zululand, Your Majesty.
Whatever for?
We really have to box in the Boers if we possibly can...
Oh, Prime Minister, you really are terribly depressing.
Yes.
Ah, sandwiches! Mmm!
[man] Splendid!
[man] That's wonderful.
Splendid!
Jelly, Your Majesty.
I suddenly feel a great deal better.
What the hell were you thinking?
You said, "Present the jelly," sir.
I didn't say kiss the feet of the Empress of India!
I thought it would cheer her up.
Cheer her up?
They'll have me court-martialed!
What on Earth is going on?
Her Majesty has requested Mr. Karim and Mr. Baksh
be her personal footmen
for the rest of the Jubilee.
You stupid, bloody idiot.
All you had to do was give her jelly
and then we can go home.
Ah, gentlemen. You can wait here by the door.
Her Majesty wants you to stand in here, by the writing desk.
Go on.
Thank you.
You may go.
Oh, thank you, Your Majesty.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to eat you.
"Dr. Reid,
a very successful movement
at eight o'clock this morning."
What the hell is going on in there?
Thank you, Mr...
Abdul.
Abdul Karim.
I am always writing.
In India, I'm writing all day, every day.
So in India, you are not a servant?
No. In India, I'm writing in my very big book.
You're writing a book?
Yes. I'm writing every name, who they are, what they have done.
This is my life.
Every day, I'm writing, from morning to night.
-And is this fiction? -No.
It is the very truth.
I don't understand.
If you are an author, why are you here?
Presenting me with a...
Mohur.
It is my humble privilege to serve Her Majesty.
I was the one who chose your carpets.
Carpets?
Yes. The Viceroy asked Mr. Tyler, sir, but actually it was me.
You have to have a very good eye for the carpets.
Like, this is a very nice one, for example.
Very, very tight knots.
The art of carpets
came to India from Persia with the great Emperor Akbar.
The skill of a carpet
is to bring all the different kinds of threads together
and weave something we can all stand on.
You seem to know a great deal about it.
My family were carpet makers,
but now I write in the book.
Life is like a carpet.
We weave in and out to make a pattern.
That is a very beautiful image.
Look.
Here is the bird of freedom caught forever in the design.
So, in India you are a poet?
No.
In India, I make a ledger of the prisoners.
We are all prisoners, Mr. Karim.
Apparently, he's a poet.
What the bloody hell are you playing at?
Don't get too friendly, else we'll be stuck here.
These people are the exploiters of a quarter of all of mankind.
Do you really think they give a hoot about us, huh?
We'll bloody well freeze to death at this rate.
Cut all the nicey-nicey crap, and let's get the hell out of here.
Agreed?
I promise.
Good night.
Will you stop doing that?
You realize
this is the third day in a row.
[Queen Victoria] So, Mr. Abdul,
may I ask what part of India you're from?
I'm from Agra.
The Taj Mahal?
-You have been to the Taj Mahal? -No.
It is the most marvelous building in the entire world, Your Majesty.
The Crown of Palaces.
It was built by Shah Jahān to remember his dead wife
who died at childbirth during their fourteenth child.
Goodness!
He was so upset with grief,
he brought the greatest architects from Persia, Afghanistan,
to build the Taj Mahal.
It certainly sounds a handsome building.
I'd very much like to see it.
Oh, it is beautiful, Your Majesty!
It's all white marble.
All that beauty for the dead Queen.
Mmm. How romantic.
[Abdul] Shah Jahān also built the Red Fort,
the Gardens of Shalimar, the Peacock Throne.
The Peacock Throne?
It is the most beautiful throne in all the world.
And inside the throne was the Koh-i-noor.
But I have the Koh-i-noor. I wear it as a brooch.
-Do you? -Yes!
It wasn't very shiny, so Albert had it recut.
What happened to the Peacock Throne?
They smashed it up.
How awful.
They're always smashing things up.
The British soldiers have taken the jewels from the Taj Mahal.
British soldiers?
Yes, after the Mutiny.
But this is terrible.
What can they be talking about?
A servant and an Indian.
What on Earth does she see in him?
Well, he is rather handsome.
What happened to Shah Jahān?
He was overthrown by his son and died in Agra Fort.
The wickedness of children.
They buried him in the Taj Mahal with his wife, Mumtāz.
They also wrote an inscription.
"Here lies Shah Jahān
who left this world for the Banquet Hall of Eternity."
"The Banquet Hall of Eternity."
I rather like that idea.
You seem very well-informed.
Ah, these are famous stories of Uttar Pradesh.
You should go there.
-Oh, I can never go there. I'm forbidden. -Forbidden?
They fear I would be assassinated.
So, you have never seen a India street?
-Or a stall of spices? -No.
Oh, the spices!
Cumin, coriander,
garam masala.
Garam masa... What is garam masala?
It is what you put into the sauce.
You have never tasted Indian food?
Dal? Rogan josh?
Biryani with mango chutney.
Mango chutney?
[chuckles] Chutney made out of mango.
What is mango?
Mango is the queen of fruit.
What does it taste like?
Like an orange
and a peach.
Sir Henry,
-I would like a mango. -A mango?
Yes, I would like to taste a mango.
That's impossible, Your Majesty.
They only grow in India.
Well, I'm Empress of India, so have one sent.
Here!
Your Majesty?
Thank you.
Another one. Thank you.
How do you like your new Scottish costumes?
They're very scratchy, Your Majesty.
Everything in Scotland is scratchy.
Sir Henry?
When does Bertie arrive?
Tomorrow, Your Majesty.
He's on his way from Monte Carlo.
It's all right for her. She's upholstered.
Oh, God, I hate Scotland!
You must be the Hindus! Very nice to meet you.
You must be the Hindus.
You must be the Hindus.
More, more! More! More.
I wish she'd bloody well go to bed.
[Sir Henry] Good morning, Your Majesty.
-The boxes, Your Majesty. -Thank you.
And the blank journal Your Majesty requested.
You may go.
I'm perfectly capable of working through the boxes.
Abdul is very helpful with his blotter.
But these are parliamentary papers, Your Majesty.
I'm aware of that.
But Abdul is a servant.
He cannot assist with the boxes.
And I am the Queen of England.
I will have whatever help I require with the boxes.
And, Sir Henry,
would you get some gloves for the Hindus?
They're suffering terribly from the cold.
He's helping her with the boxes.
I want you to teach me Indian.
Indian?
Hindu, or whatever it is you speak.
-Are you sure? -Of course I'm sure.
But why would you like to learn Hindi, Your Majesty?
Well, I'm Empress of India.
Look, I've ordered a book.
I want you to give me private lessons.
I can't teach you Hindi, Your Majesty.
Why ever not?
You are the Empress of India.
You should learn Urdu, language of the Mughals.
There are a thousand languages in India.
But Urdu is the most noble.
In Hindi,
you write like this.
But in Urdu, you write like this.
-"I am the Queen." -I see.
He's teaching her Hindu.
Is that allowed?
I think you will find it is Urdu.
-The Muslim version. -Oh, my goodness me!
[speaking English] That's it.
You are the Queen.
The Queen is very wise.
You see?
Now, you write it down.
She's writing in her journal.
And she's speaking in Hindustani.
No, it's Urdu, actually.
The Muslim version.
Knee. Knee. Knee.
Yes! Yes!
Thank you, Abdul.
You are an excellent teacher.
-Bertie! -Mother!
Were you spying on me?
Were you learning Urdu?
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.
You think that's entirely appropriate?
Well, I'm Empress of India. What could be more appropriate?
But in front of the entire household?
You're absolutely right.
I have no privacy here.
Sir Henry,
I would like to go with Abdul to Glassalt Shiel.
-Glassalt Shiel? -Alone.
But I've only just got here!
Oh, to be by oneself and live a simple, rudimentary existence.
They don't understand anything,
those stupid aristocratic fools.
Toadying around. Jockeying for position.
[chuckles] I've had it all my life.
They couldn't bear me bringing dear John Brown here.
Yet I was happier here than anywhere in the entire world.
Oh, I miss him, Abdul.
And Albert.
It's 30 years now, and I think of him every day.
I'm so lonely.
Everyone I've really loved has died, and I just go on and on.
[whispering] Your Majesty.
It's an impossible position.
No one really knows what it's like to be Queen.
I'm hated by millions of people all over the world.
I have had nine children, all vain and jealous,
and at loggerheads with each other.
And Bertie's a complete embarrassment.
And look at me!
A fat, lame, impotent, silly old woman.
What is the point, Abdul?
What is the point?
Service.
Service?
I think we are not here to worry about ourselves.
We are here for a greater purpose.
In the Koran it says, "We are here for the good of others."
The Koran?
Yes, I am a hafiz. I know the Koran by heart.
By heart? Isn't it very long?
114 surahs, containing 6,236 verses.
And you know every word?
Many Muslim people know the Koran.
I thought you were Hindu.
I am a Muslim, Your Majesty.
I learned the Koran from my father.
He's my munshi.
Munshi?
Yes. Munshi. My teacher.
Well, we would like you to be the Queen's munshi.
But I'm only a servant, Your Majesty.
A servant cannot be a munshi.
Well, you are a servant no longer.
You are my teacher.
You will teach me Urdu, and the Koran, and anything else you can think of.
[Bertie] So...
What the hell is a munshi?
Well, apparently it's some sort of a spiritual teacher,
Your Royal Highness.
Has she completely lost her mind?
She's the head of the Church of England, for God's sake.
What's the Archbishop of Canterbury going to say?
I say he's the "brown" John Brown.
Oh, my God!
Your Majesty.
Good evening, Bertie.
Mother.
What the hell are you wearing?
[head waiter] Dinner is served!
[Bertie] Lady Churchill
was absolutely scandalized sitting next to a servant.
And a Hindu to boot!
The Munshi is a Muslim scholar and knows the Koran off by heart.
And for your information, he's a servant no longer.
He's to be given a staff of his own.
What do you mean, "a staff"?
The little fat one.
Oh, this is absurd!
Letters, invitations to supper...
You're treating him like a member of the family.
No, I like Abdul.
Lady Churchill had better get used to the fact
as the Munshi is coming on holiday with us.
As a member of the household.
You can't take a Muslim to Florence.
I can take a Muslim wherever I like.
Good night, Bertie.
[Mohammed] Munshi?
Yes.
A spiritual advisor?
You haven't an idea in your head!
You promised to get us out of here, and now we're going to bloody Florence.
You don't see what a privilege it is to see the glories of Italy
with all these wonderful people.
You complete bloody idiot!
Do you think they're just going to stand there and let her promote a wog?
I did not come here to carry your bloody cases.
What are you complaining about?
We have our own carriage with a bathroom.
They've made a very nice bed for you on the floor.
Oh, I'm dying here.
I want to go home.
I'm getting sick of your negative attitude.
Life is a big adventure.
You just need to open up and enjoy it.
We're on holiday.
And what? What on Earth can possibly go wrong?
"Do not pull."
I would like to apologize for the emergency brakes, Your Majesty.
And I hope you did not get injured.
Oh, Abdul!
It was nothing.
It was a perfectly understandable mistake.
I'm so glad you're with us.
-What a treat to show you Florence. -What's he doing here?
Abdul came to explain what happened earlier.
I really don't see why I have to share your bathroom.
I shared a bed with my mother until I became Queen.
I am 57 years old.
The Munshi has got his own bathroom.
-Yes, very fine bathroom. -Yes, yes!
Good night, Mama.
[Abdul] Good night, Mr. Bertie.
Bertie, make sure you shut that door.
Abdul,
I have something for you.
To celebrate your first visit to Florence and for becoming my munshi.
It is a locket.
With a picture of me.
How can I ever thank you, Your Majesty?
Keep me safe.
Forever.
Oh, Abdul.
You will love Florence.
Such wonderful views.
[Queen Victoria] Isn't it glorious?
Albert loved it here.
He so admired the Medicis,
that they commissioned the greatest artists of the day
in order to leave something astonishing behind.
In India also, we commission great artists.
Each emperor would bring the greatest craftsmen
to make great glories for their durbar room.
-Durbar room? -Yes.
Every emperor had a durbar room,
full of the finest things known to man.
Well, I'm the Empress of India, I should have a durbar room.
That's a wonderful idea, Your Majesty.
But where would you put it?
Oh, the Isle of Wight, obviously.
Your Majesty,
Signor Puccini has arrived.
Where did you say it was from, Mr. Puccini?
From my new opera, Your Majesty,
Manon Lescaut.
About two lovers who are separated by the class divide.
But they run away together.
Oh, it sounds marvelous!
But she is imprisoned for her love.
But they escape.
Bravo!
But finally she dies,
and he is utterly bereft.
I'm not sure we do like the sound of it after all.
We prefer comic opera.
Do you know any Gilbert and Sullivan?
Perhaps Your Majesty will sing us a song?
-Please? -Oh, no, I couldn't possibly.
Of course, of course, yes, Your Majesty!
-No, really. -Yes, Your Majesty.
Oh, well.
Maybe just one.
From Pinafore, Bertie?
Do I have to?

I was taught by Mendelssohn, you know?
-To the Queen! -[all] To the Queen!
To me!
We shouldn't have had so much champagne.
May I?
Oh, Abdul!
I haven't been as happy as this for years.
When I first came to England,
I was terrified of you.
But you're a very kind lady.
You're a very unique lady to me.
And you are very, very unique to me, Abdul.
I know that you are much older than me,
and...
you are the Queen of England,
and the Empress of India,
and I'm just a humble munshi.
But I think
you are the most special person in my whole life.
Even more special than my wife.
Wife?
Yes.
You're married?
Of course.
Where is your wife?
In India.
Why didn't you tell me you were married?
I didn't think it mattered.
Well, of course it matters.
It changes everything.
You must return to India immediately.
And bring her back at once.
How is the weather in Agra these days?
[sighs] Bloody hell.
He's coming!
How terribly exciting.
It's Ali Baba!
Look at the size of him.
Where'd he get those medals?
What the devil is she wearing?
You can't even see her face.
She looks rather splendid.
But you cannot actually see her, Your Majesty.
I think it's rather dignified.
Who the hell is that?
[Mohammed] Get the bags, boy.
[Miss Phipps] He's brought a serving boy.
Good God, another one! How many has he got in there?
Ruddy sod's a bigamist.
I do hope they like their little cottage.
-Your Majesty. -I hope it's not inconvenient.
I just thought we'd pop round for tea.
This is my granddaughter, Sophia, Queen of Greece.
And this is Grand Duchess Sophie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.
And my daughter,
Princess Helena Augusta Victoria
of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Augustenburg.
This is my wife, Mrs. Karim.
And this is my mother-in-law.
Your Majesty, Sophia, Queen of Greece,
Grand Duchess Sophie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach,
Princess Helena Augusta Victoria
of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Augustenburg,
I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of myself,
my wife, and my wife's mother,
to thank Her Majesty for accommodating us.
We are very grateful for her infinite kindness
and interior decoration.
The gift of hospitality and friendship to strangers
is of very high importance in our culture.
And so we are honored to repay it in our own small way.
What is ours is yours.
Quite literally.
Alhamdulillah.
[Queen Victoria] My dear Munshi,
we are so glad to have you here, my children.
We have missed you enormously.
I can't wait to show you the Durbar Room.
Children?
Ponsonby, you will have to do something about this.
My dear Munshi, I'm so glad you're back.
It's been dreadfully dull without you.
And I'm so glad to meet Mrs. Karim.
There is just one thing I've been curious about the whole afternoon.
What does she look like behind her veil?
You must see her.
Is that allowed?
You're a lady. And the Empress of India. Oh...
Well, where the bloody hell's she going now?
[Mrs. Karim] Your Majesty.
You really are beautiful.
[Lord Salisbury] What on Earth is a durbar room?
It's a celebration of all things Indian, Prime Minister,
inspired by the Mughal emperors.
But I don't understand.
Who gave her permission to build this in the first place?
Don't blame me, I was in Monte Carlo.
I'm afraid she's a law unto herself, Prime Minister.
For God's sake! She'll be wearing a burqa next.
Prime Minister, you are late.
I'm terribly sorry, Your Majesty.
Well, let us begin.
This, as you can see, is the Indian corridor.
The Durbar Room was designed by Mr. Bhai Ram Singh.
The place is crawling with them.
We have commissioned a series of portraits of eminent Indians.
This...
Princess Gowramma.
And this of course,
is the Munshi.
An honor to meet you, Mr. Prime Minister, sir.
A good likeness, don't you think?
I had asked him to take a few pounds off.
This is my wife, Mr. Prime Minister, sir.
And that is my mother-in-law.
At least I think that's the right way round.
These are my servants,
Mohammed and Ahmed.
And this is the Durbar Room.
What the hell is going on here, Ponsonby?
The carvings are from Uttar Pradesh.
And the carpet was woven in a jail in Agra.
Perfect, I think, for the tableau.
But the pièce de résistance
is the Peacock Throne.
An exact copy of the one at Agra.
And, of course, the Koh-i-noor.
Now I really do feel like the Empress of India.
I thought she was supposed to be dying.
It really is a remarkable addition to the house, Your Majesty.
We have Abdul to thank for the whole idea.
To celebrate the completion of the Durbar Room,
a little surprise, Your Majesty.
What is it?
A mango, Your Majesty.
[Abdul] One moment, Your Majesty.
It's off.
[Queen Victoria] Sir Henry.
This mango is off.
I'm terribly sorry, Your Majesty.
Take one of these whenever you see the Munshi.
[Queen Victoria] I can't wait to show you the tableau, Prime Minister.
A line has definitively been crossed.
I can't go on stage like this.
I'm absolutely sick.
But you have to.
The Prime Minister will be watching.
This is a complete and utter disaster.
I don't know what you're talking about. -They've been waiting for this. -Who? Who have?
-They've been waiting for this. -Who? Who have?
Ponsonby, Reid, the whole damn lot.
Don't you see? She's been rubbing their noses in it,
but now it's going public.
I'm telling you, they're not going to stand for it.
They'll rise up and chop your bloody balls off.
-I haven't done anything. -You stupid bloody Uncle Tom.
You can't win on their terms.
Mrs. Munshi.
Bertie.
I've never been so humiliated in my entire life.
Actually, I'm rather enjoying it.
Beginners on stage, please.
A scene in Ancient Persia.
I am the Sultan of Persia.
The King of all Kings.
Your Highness!
We bestow upon you all the riches of the Orient.
You are now under my power!
Bravo, bravo, the Munshi!
What the hell is this, Ponsonby? Munshi-mania?
I'm trying to keep an empire together,
looks like they're running the place.
I want this whole sodding mess knocked on the head.
Or you're finished.
Understood?
[Queen Victoria] Oh, Sir Henry.
Tell us what exactly did the Prime Minister say about the tableau?
To be entirely frank, Your Majesty,
he seemed to be a little perturbed.
Whatever for?
He must have liked the Munshi.
I think the Munshi was the problem, Your Majesty.
Really? I thought he was rather good.
I think he meant his position, I think he was rather alarmed
he had such a prominent role in the household.
Well, of course, Abdul has a prominent role in the household.
He is my Munshi.
But he's an Indian, Your Majesty.
I am aware of that.
[Sir Henry] Given current sensitivities in the subcontinent, Your Majesty,
the Prime Minister was concerned that it might be
the Prime Minister was concerned that it might be sending the wrong message.
I should have thought it was a jolly good message.
But he's a Muslim, Your Majesty.
Precisely.
We owe them so much, do we not?
For their role in the Mutiny, for example.
The Mutiny, Your Majesty?
Yes, for the help they gave us with the Hindus.
But the Mutiny was a Muslim-led revolt, Your Majesty.
Are you sure?
[Dr. Reid] Of course.
The Muslim soldiers revolted
when it was rumored that their rifles were greased with pork fat.
Really?
[Sir Henry] The Grand Mufti, himself,
put out a fatwa against you personally, Your Majesty.
And Muslim soldiers murdered over 2,000 British personnel.
Who have you been talking to, Mother?
Ta-da!
I have opened my heart to you.
I brought your family from India.
I promoted you in the face of considerable opposition
and disquiet from the household.
I even turned a blind eye
when you failed to tell me that you were married,
which, as you know, came as quite a surprise.
How could you let me humiliate myself in front of the entire household?
I am deeply sorry, Your Majesty.
[Queen Victoria] You said the Hindus were behind the Mutiny.
[Abdul] I didn't say it was only the Hindus.
[Queen Victoria] You told me categorically the Muslims were my friends.
[Abdul] We are your friends, Your...
[Queen Victoria] Abdul, there is a fatwa against me.
It was the Muslims who started the whole thing.
This is completely unacceptable.
Abdul, I thought you were outstanding as the Sultan of Persia,
but I'm afraid you have to go home.
[mouthing] Hallelujah!
You've hurt my feelings very much indeed.
Don't you see the position you have put me in?
Thank you for everything you've done for me.
I will miss you a very great deal.
So, we're going home?
Good night, Mother.
Good night.
Mrs. Tuck?
Mrs. Tuck.
Abdul.
You've been an utter fool.
And I'm absolutely furious with you.
It is unconscionable that as my munshi
you should have lied to me in any way.
But...
It would be also completely churlish of me
not to recognize the considerable kindness
and devotion you have shown.
I suppose in some way you thought you were protecting me.
But as the monarch I realize that nothing can really protect me.
And so, in that light, I have decided,
although I'm very disappointed,
that I want you to stay.
Your gracious Majesty. Thank you, Your Majesty.
Abdul, there is something we must sort out.
I am deeply concerned about Mrs. Karim.
Mrs. Karim?
By now, one would have expected
to hear the pitter-patter of little Muslim feet
along the corridors of Osborne House.
I am concerned that everything is
functioning below stairs.
I want you to examine Mrs. Karim.
Examine Mrs. Karim? Mmm.
Just, um, make sure that everything's working.
But, Your Majesty, uh,
I thought the Munshi and his family were leaving us.
Whatever gave you that impression?
The Munshi and his family are integral parts of the Royal household.
[Bertie] As far as I'm concerned,
this is war.
We're gonna dig up every last bit of dirt this blackguard's ever done.
I want someone in India raking through the family coals.
Your son's out there, isn't he, Ponsonby?
I couldn't possibly be involved in subterfuge, Your Royal Highness.
Look, very soon I am going to be King.
You will bloody well do as you're told!
You'll leave no stone unturned.
You will make a dossier,
and you put it all down in black and white.
And put an end to all this shit!
For good.
Well, I'd better go and examine Mrs. Munshi.
[Abdul] Oh, Dr. Reid.
Do come in.
She'll have to uncover her face.
That is impossible, sir.
I need to see her tongue.
Well?
She's fine.
[Sir Henry] Uh, Mr. Mohammed.
We have come here because we are not unaware of your predicament.
That you arrived in the first place almost by accident,
and now find yourself stuck here
through a bizarre set of circumstances, none of your own making.
Nor is it beneath our notice
that the inclement English weather
has been the cause of a precipitous decline
in your general health.
What is more,
you continue to suffer the vast indignity
of being a servant to someone who is in many ways your inferior.
So, it occurred to us that, um,
we might be able to offer you some help.
Help?
Travel home.
Perhaps a modest pension.
In return, of course, for, um...
A little information.
You want me to
dish the dirty?
In a manner of speaking.
What would you like me to say?
Anything, really.
Well, we need details. Um...
What he says.
What he does.
Abdul does what everyone else does.
He, uh...
He looks for preferment.
He curries favor.
He crawls up the stinking greasy pole
of the shitty British Empire.
Making fools of all of you, because he is a servant.
An Indian Muslim servant,
and you are all quaking in your boots
because he's beating you at your own game.
No one is quaking in their boots.
We are the most powerful nation on Earth.
At the height of our influence.
In that case,
the only way is down.
So stick your stupid British Empire
up your stinky royal bottom hole, Mr. Bertie Prince, sir.
I hope he makes the whole damn thing come tumbling down.
I will see to it that you die here.
He didn't say anything.
What do you mean, "He didn't say anything"?
We did our best with him,
but he spoke most intemperately.
The man is an absolute shit.
[Queen Victoria] Dr. Reid.
I'm not a fool.
I know there is some skulduggery afoot.
Something's going on here, and I'm not going to stand for it.
Dr. Reid,
I asked you to get to the bottom of Mrs. Karim's fertility issues.
It seems that nothing has been done.
Well, actually, Your Majesty,
it was impossible to make a conclusive judgment
for religious reasons.
Did you examine the Munshi?
-No, Your Majesty. -Well, examine the Munshi.
Bertie.
[whispering] I did not do seven years at Edinburgh University
to look at Indian dicks!
Trousers.
Eureka! He is riddled with the clap!
Well, well.
Mother, we have to see you.
Alone.
I'm in the middle of my Urdu lesson.
Mother, we come with very important news of a highly personal matter.
I've nothing to hide from Abdul.
Please, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, um...
I'm afraid our news concerns the Munshi. Um...
We have proof beyond any doubt that Abdul Karim
is a low-born impostor,
Your Majesty.
The Munshi is from a noble family and a long line of teachers.
No, I'm afraid he was a mere clerk in a common jail.
My own son has sent word from India and has actually spoken
to his immediate superior.
His family are completely uneducated.
His father is a lowly apothecary.
[Bertie] The Munshi never even went to school, Mother.
The man's a complete fraud.
And here he is, overlooking the boxes.
[Sir Henry] I'm afraid it's true, Your Majesty.
Abdul and his father are completely common.
We have prepared a dossier.
You despicable toads!
Racialists!
Spying? Dossier?
Picking on a poor defenseless Indian?
Of course, he doesn't have qualifications.
They do things completely differently out there.
But don't you see, Mama?
He's using his position for his own gain.
And how does that make him any different from any of you?
How dare you look down on Abdul?
How dare you defame his poor father?
Bertie, I'm ashamed that you're part of all this.
Abdul is a loyal, wise, sympathetic human being,
who has raised himself on his own merits.
Bring Abdul in here.
Bring him in!
Now, I want you to repeat after me,
"I will be courteous to the Munshi."
I will be courteous to the Munshi.
You.
I will be courteous to the Munshi.
Bertie. All of you.
"I will be courteous to the Munshi."
[all] I will be courteous to the Munshi.
It has become apparent
that in order to get any respect from the household,
one needs to be formally recognized.
In which case, Abdul.
I intend to give you a knighthood in the next honors list.
Enough! This is absurd!
We cannot protect you from this any further.
The man is riddled with gonorrhea!
[softly] Gonorrhea?
[Sir Henry] Yes. Your Majesty.
Well, you are a doctor. Why don't you treat him?
Now get out of my sight, all of you!
Listen, you pox-ridden Indian shit!
Why don't you bloody well leave her alone? Dr. Reid! Dr. Reid!
Be courteous!
Knighted?
Surely, there is some law against it.
The man's a common Indian, for God's sakes.
Well, she can't just do what she likes.
That's right.
We are the ones who make this palace work,
and we are being ignored
-and exploited. -[all] Yes.
We have to stand up to this wanton bullying.
But she's the Queen.
She's our sovereign.
Her position is based entirely
on the implicit contract she makes with us.
If she does not drop this preposterous insult,
we should all leave!
-[man] Yes. -[murmuring]
Somebody has to tell her.
We should make a deputation.
I think you should go.
You're the head of the household.
Oh, no, I couldn't possibly go.
It would bring the position into disrepute.
Mrs. Tuck.
You know her very well, don't you?
But I'm just her dresser.
What about you, Miss Phipps?
Off you go.
And don't take "no" for an answer.
Your Majesty.
Out with it.
Girl, can't you see, I'm busy.
There is something I must say that...
What is the meaning of this? Stop shaking!
I have come to ask you to reconsider the, uh...
[shakily] The elevation of...
Of Mr. Karim.
What did you say?
I've come to ask you not to give Mr. Karim a knighthood, Your Majesty.
Why the devil not?
The members of the household demand
that you abandon your plans, Your Majesty.
Demand?
We believe that it degrades the very concept of knighthood.
He comes from a very low family, Your Majesty.
And...
He is colored.
Get out of my sight.
Did you not hear me?
Your Majesty, I must inform you that if you refuse,
the entire household will resign.
Treason!
Treason!
Treason.
Mummy, enough is enough.
You will drop this Munshi business forthwith.
Do you hear me?
Did you really think the Household would countenance such an insult?
I will not be disobeyed.
No. No.
I have put up with you for over 50 years!
You will drop this forthwith or...
-Or, or, or, or, Bertie? -Or...
we will have you certified insane!
And removed from office immediately.
Here are the papers signed by Dr. Reid.
I am 81 years of age.
I've had nine children, and 42 grandchildren,
and have almost a billion citizens.
I have rheumatism,
a collapsed uterus.
I'm morbidly obese
and deaf in one ear.
I have known 11 Prime Ministers
and passed 2,347 pieces of legislation.
I've been in office 62 years, 234 days.
Thus, I am the longest-serving monarch in world history.
I'm responsible for five households
and a staff of over 3,000.
I am cantankerous,
boring, greedy,
fat, ill-tempered,
at times selfish and myopic, both metaphorically and literally.
I am perhaps disagreeably attached to power
and should not have smashed the Emperor of Russia's egg.
But I am anything but insane.
If the household wish to disobey me, so be it.
Let them do it to my face.
I will see everyone in the Durbar Room at once.
[Alick] Her Majesty the Queen.
I understand there is some concern
over my desires on preferment.
I understand feelings have run high.
And I understand you have decided to resign,
rather than withstand my decision.
If any one of you
wishes to tender their resignation,
it will be accepted
without any unfortunate consequences.
But at least have the decency to do it to my face!
Anyone wishing to resign, please step forward.
I would like to inform you that I have decided against
awarding any knighthoods at this moment.
Instead, you'll be delighted to know
that I have decided
to make the Munshi a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order
as a special token of my personal esteem
for his services to the Empire.
That is all.
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!
-[groans] -Your Majesty, are you all right?
Dr. Reid! Dr. Reid!
Dr. Reid! Dr. Reid! -Dr. Reid! -[shushes]
-Dr. Reid, you must come quick! -No, no, not now.
Dr. Reid! It's Mr. Mohammed!
[Lady Churchill] Get that boy out of here. Your Majesty, can you hear me?
Your Majesty?
All right, let's get you up.
I'm so sorry, Abdul.
I think it's time you went home, Abdul.
This is my home.
I've been short-sighted and selfish.
You are a young man.
You have your whole life ahead of you.
It's not safe here.
-Your Majesty. -The vultures are already circling.
How can I protect you if I'm not here?
Your Majesty, you will reign for many years to come.
No, Abdul.
I'm sick.
All these stupid ceremonies will kill me.
You have been a very good friend.
But you must leave me.
I'm your servant.
And as long as I shall live,
I shall be by your side.
Every single day.
Nothing...
Nothing will stop me.
Abdul, I am your Queen.
Your Majesty, I'm your Munshi.
And I will never leave you.
You are a fool.
But I adore you.
I think you should inform the Kaiser.
Abdul... Abdul...
-Abdul... -[Bertie] It's me, Mummy.
And your grandson, Wilhelm.
Where is my Munshi?
-The Kaiser. -I need my Munshi.
Hush, hush. Everything will be all right.
I want the Munshi.
[softly] Don't you dare upset her.
I want to talk to the Munshi alone.
[Dr. Reid] I... I think perhaps, Your Majesty--
I said alone.
When I was young,
I used to long for death.
Now, when there is nothing to live for,
I cling to life with every breath.
I'm scared, Abdul.
Don't be scared.
"Listen, little drop,
give yourself up without regret
and in return you will gain the ocean.
Give yourself away
and in the great sea you will be secure."
Rumi.
You are a teacher, Abdul.
Everybody knows Rumi.
Allah is the teacher.
Love is the whole.
We are only pieces.
Alhamdulillah.
I keep thinking I'm falling.
Fall.
All will be well.
You are about to go to a much safer place.
"The Banquet Hall of Eternity."
Yes.
Goodbye,
my Queen.
Goodbye.
Take care,
my sweet son.
[Dr. Reid] Let her sleep.
Someone's coming.
I grieve to say
Her Majesty passed away at 6:30 precisely.
Long live the King.
Out the way!
I want every last thing that's connected to her.
[Mrs. Karim] Abdul! Abdul!
I want you out of here.
Immediately.
Your Majesty!
[man 1] Jonathan, cancel my 10:00.
[man 2] Conor, get in here. Conor?
-[woman 2] Bring me my lunch! -[man 3] What's my password?
[woman 2] Rachel, where were you? Were you in the back?
Coming.
No, no, no. I said no onions. I said onions were fatal.
As in if there are onions, I will be killed.
I know it says, "Do not duplicate," but my boss says, "Do duplicate."
And right now, her rules supersede the state of New York's.
Janet, I've got a master's in sociology and nothing else to do today.
Put me on hold as long as you want.
I'm not hanging up until his seat is bumped to first class.
-[cell phone ringing] -I'm coming.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
[man] Hi, Tammy.
He wanted me to let you know that he's breaking up with you
and he needs you out of the apartment by 6:00.
[Tammy] You think you can break up with me? I wanna talk to Richard.
-Get that asshole on the phone. -[sighs]
Get this to my doctor. That needs to be warm.
And ask if it's contagious.
Be free. Heh. Save yourself.
-Are you trying to starve me? -No.
My bones are eating themselves. Order me that thing
My bones are eating themselves. Order me that thing that I like from that place with the gay waiter.
We're doing a second dinner?
And make sure that this is at 10,000 steps before Yuvus gets here tomorrow.
I do not want him to think I was not working out between sessions.
Got it.
[chuckles] Hi, yes. Oh, my God. I've been on hold for so long.
Yes, the truffle mac and cheese, the kale salad...
and a hamburger.
Forty-five minutes? Is there any way it could be five minutes instead?
No?
That's fine. I'll be here for the next 45 minutes.
I'll be here forever.
[man] Taxi!
Just waiting for my boss.
Rick Otis. He'd been on Shark Tank. Forbes 40 Under 40.
-Doorway area is for members only. -Yeah.
Just gotta call my girlfriend. Her name's Suze. She's very pretty.
Suze. Rick's working late at the District Club. Can I just meet--?
I'm out.
-How'd it go? You, uh, gonna invest? -Ha.
I'll invest in that company when they figure out
how to dip their dicks in ink and write the Japanese symbol for "horse shit."
Do the thing.
Think of seared cod.
Melt-in-your-mouth uni. Buttered carrots, mashed potatoes, crispy onion rings.
Ah.
-Okay. -I will see you tomorrow.
No. You're coming with me back to the office.
Oh.
-Should I order dinner? -Of course not. I just had my juice.
-Sometimes you end up wanting dinner. -Shut my damn door.
[Harper] Here you go, Kirsten.
So...
tomorrow, we're gonna post the Alex Morgan profile in the morning
tomorrow, we're gonna post the Alex Morgan profile in the morning and the Belichick interview in the afternoon.
and the Belichick interview in the afternoon. Hold the Belichick interview. Josh is writing like he's at The Post.
The Line Up is about the story behind the score.
I need fresh eyes for a rewrite.
-Did you return my blue jacket? -Yes.
After a 2-hour commute to their warehouse and an intense talk with a saleswoman
that ended with us in tears, I got a full refund.
-I want it back. What else? -Absolutely.
You owe RSVPs to Polly's wedding, Annie's baby shower,
Bridget's baby shower, Alice's son's birthday. You RSVP'd Jane's wedding,
but they need your okay to share a room with Helen since you're both coming alone.
Do they need me to confirm
that I'm gonna spend a thousand dollars a night
to share bunk beds like kids at sleep-away camp?
No.
This site is less than a year old.
I can't be expected to attend every friend of a friend's kid's 3rd birthday.
Decline every invitation and send a $200 gift.
$200 gift.
There should be three times as many story ideas by now.
I might have a story idea.
It's not fleshed out. I haven't cracked it, so...
Oh, good. So, you're telling me it's bad before I've even heard it.
It's this thing... called the Gerilympics.
It's an Olympics for senior citizens.
They have races, ping-pong, Nerf basketball, and weightlifting.
Yes, people think it's silly. People think it's silly, but...
But it gives them something to live for. And a lot of them
were athletes who never even got a chance to, like...
To live their dreams.
It's just sometimes I get emotional over sports, just how they can provide...
Your dinner.
Which I'm gonna go get right now.
What's my tomorrow like?
Um... I moved your lunch to Ai Fiori's.
Kiki wants to go over divorce papers.
Okay, you can tell Kiki she can light herself on fire.
-And if she calls or--? -You tell her she don't divorce me.
I divorce her.
Call my lawyer and tell him to counter-serve her for serving me.
-I don't know if legally-- -What is this? I hate it.
This is your son's science project.
It's a fun play on "when life gives you lemons..."
I'm using lemon battery to power...
Where's my dinner?
Did you want dinner? Because you s--
No problem.
Coming right up.
I order from you guys like three times a week.
You know that I'm good for it. I have three credit cards.
-Can I write a check? -Cash only.
What if I pay you triple... tomorrow?
Cash only.
What if I told you this face was a mask and I'm a 100-year-old gypsy
who will curse your family for generations?
Cash only.
What grocery store doesn't serve
saffron-infused Kobe beef cooked medium-rare?
[Harper] I can't go up there and ask for cash, so my options are for you to help me
or for me to commit a felony.
Hi. Whose food is this?
-It's mine. -You got 31.32, it's yours.
I have cash. I have so much cash.
No. Hey, hey. That's my boss's dinner.
If I'm not upstairs in two minutes with that food, I will get fired.
-Can I borrow some money? -No.
This is my boss's dinner. If I'm not up in two minutes,
-I'm gonna be fired. -No, you won't. Look at you.
You'll just swoop in with your lacrosse stick and your fraternity connections.
You'll keep getting promoted for no reason. I need that food.
Thirty-two dollars. Keep the change. Thank you.
Is this happening? I will not forget this.
-Whatever. -Wait. Sir?
Sir. There are two dinners. One for me and one for her, so we could split it.
I can take one to my boss and you can take one to yours. Please. This is DEFCON 5.
DEFCON 5's the good one. Everything's safe, international travel's fine.
DEFCON 1! You know what I mean.
What are the meals?
Okay. I'm gonna take her the truffle mac and cheese.
You can have the burger.
Are you insane? I won't give him a plain hamburger. He has taste.
Okay. I'm gonna fix this, okay?
See what I'm making? It's a truffle cheeseburger with kale.
This burger could win awards. Pickle is my dinner.
-No, no, no. -What?
I won't give him a truffle cheeseburger without a pickle.
I wanna be paid back tomorrow, 8 percent interest, liquidity preference.
Do I look like I can afford interest?
I steal my toilet paper from the office bathroom.
You should learn to keep cash on you.
You should remember to order dinner before everything closes.
You know that pickle? That aforementioned pickle?
That wasn't for my boss. That was for me.
You're a monster.
-Oh, hi. -I'll need you in here before me tomorrow.
Okay, what time would that be? Do you want your food? Okay.
-[Suze] Hello? -I'm here, I'm here.
You took too long. I'm in bed.
Okay. Perfect. I'll get in with you.
I'm already asleep, baby.
I can wake you up. With my penis.
Not with my penis. You'll be fully awake when it touches-- You know what I mean.
I have an early shoot tomorrow
and if I don't get eight hours, my face could be puffy.
-Can I call you in the morning? -Yeah. Sweet dreams... princess.
[man] You can wake me up.
With your penis.
[announcer on TV] ...should be the final play unless there's a penalty.
Kellogg's throw...
It's gonna be tapped and caught! It's caught!
It's caught!
You're up! Oh, my gosh, hi.
How was your date?
It was good. He's in my room now drinking Gatorade
to recover from our vigorous love-making.
-Nice. -Really?
No. I worked late. Didn't make it in time.
Oh...
Dude, loved Kirsten's article about Cleveland fans.
-I sent it to ten people. -He did.
Wasn't it awesome? How was the party?
Gilbert was there.
You haven't seen him since...
Since she had sex with him in the bathroom on the Acela?
-You told him about that? -I could read it from your hand code.
I tell him everything, Harp.
If we had to avoid every guy she's had sex with
on public transportation, we'd never leave the apartment.
-[chuckles] Shut up. -Do you want a glass of cold water?
-Yes. I would love that. -Okay.
-I love you. -I love you so much.
-Love you, Mike. -I love you, Harper.
He's such a dork. Oh, God. I love him.
-I love you. I'm gonna go to bed. -Sweet dreams.
Good night.
-Janet? -[Becca] What?
No way!
-No way! -[Mike chuckles]
I said no. I...
I'm kidding! I said yes! [shouts]
Oh, my God. We're not old enough to get married, though.
What? What?
I love you.
Congratulations. Congratulations and I'm so happy for you.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-I love you, Mike! My favorite people. -I love you, Harper!
-I was talking to my mom-- -I'm gonna let you do that.
I just wanna spend my life with you.
-Are you kidding me? -Oh, my God.
[Mike] I'm so excited.
-[Duncan] Hey, buddy. -[yelps]
What--? How long have you been there?
You're sitting alone in the dark?
Do you have a guy over?
Why do you always assume I have a guy over?
Not all gay guys are having sex all the time.
-Don't you have to teach soon? -Can't sleep.
I'm setting up this art show for a kid living at a homeless shelter with his mom.
I think he's good enough to get into one of those magnet schools.
Today I got a waiter fired for dripping condensation on Rick's pant leg, so...
I also feel good.
When you get promoted, you can be one of those rich guys that donates supplies.
So you don't feel so bad.
We love that guy. We make him a card every year.
-I'll call you later. -You better.
Technically, this time, I did have a guy over.
[Dan] Martin's leaving. He's gonna be a VP at Sequoia Capital.
Serious? He's jumping associate and right to VP?
It's Rick. He knows everybody there.
If you got his stamp of approval,
-it's the golden ticket. -Martin's barely 30.
We weren't talking to you, dipshit. Go get Rick a smoothie.
I don't get Rick smoothies.
He's on a juice cleanse.
Paying student athletes is such a hot-button issue.
You couldn't back off? You're implying we're getting rich off poor kids.
We're not. We're proving it. Your AD bought a $2-million boat last year.
Your star player is on food stamps.
Kirsten, we are all a big happy family here.
We've always liked you. We like what you're doing here,
but don't make a name for yourself by burning bridges. [chuckles]
I sent you that article as a courtesy.
I'm not changing a word. I will send you the link when it is live.
-That was incredible. You just feel like-- -Ah-ah.
Where's my lunch?
-I'm gonna get it. -Tell me something I don't know!
Here are those ETFs.
-Intern? -My name's Bo.
-I don't give a shit. -It has fewer syllables.
Cover Rick's phone. I'm gonna get lunch. All right?
Don't pee, don't zone out, don't sneeze. Just cover his phones, try not to exist.
Do not ever, ever connect to his ex-wife.
-Do I tell him if she calls? -Yeah.
And slather my dick in ink and use it to write the hieroglyphic for "no."
-I don't know hieroglyphics. -Sorry. That was over the line.
But no, don't tell him. Go.
Do not put on any more clothes. I'm coming over.
Oh, shit.
[Rick] Someone's ass is fired!
-What happened? -He's upset about this.
-[Rick] Goddamn you, Kiki! -This is his ex-wife.
Kiki Otis is--? Oh, that makes sense.
"Spiritual commitment ceremony"? You showed him this?
You didn't say anything about his mail.
-You have no idea what-- -It's non-legal.
Rick?
What is this?! Bulletproof glass?!
Where's pencil-dick?
-I feel like I'm pencil-dick. -You're fired.
Charlie, take his work. I don't wanna see pencil-dick's face again.
Pencils can be all lengths and girths, so, the joke's on him.
Obviously, you're talented. You don't have to keep convincing us.
Start by taking out the adjectives.
-Thank you so much. -Anything for a Dartmouth grad.
It's late. Get out of here.
You are so lucky to work for her.
-I know. -I reached out to her
through the alumni magazine and she responded right away.
Now she's gonna be my mentor.
She's amazing.
Harper, I'm gonna take a nap. So, just wake me up at midnight.
Oh, but don't startle me. Play a lullaby then slowly increase the volume.
Okay.
-Hello. -Holy shit.
Here's your stupid interest. There you go.
What are you still doing here? Are you like a janitor?
Do I look like a janitor?
No.
I work for Kirsten Stevens.
-Who? -The sports reporter from ESPN.
Okay.
She got Roger Goodell to admit he'd seen the video? Don't know her?
She broke the Penguins concussion protocol story
-that literally changed the NHL. -But what are you doing here?
I can't leave until she leaves.
And she never leaves, so, I'm always the last one here.
-I'm the last one here. -No, you're not.
-Even when Rick's not here, I'm here. -Kirsten keeps a cot in her office.
Rick keeps a Tempur-Pedic cot in his office. The Tesla of cots.
Kirsten's like if Miss Piggy and Voldemort had a baby
and that baby had low blood sugar and hadn't had sex in a year.
Don't talk about babies having sex. What's wrong with you?
Do you want some?
Rick throws away any liquor that costs less than $200.
We're at work.
It's almost midnight. Grow up.
It's been so long, I have the tolerance of a fetus.
[man] It was a tough loss, but we're putting it behind us. Looking forward.
The third glass is still bad.
If you could watch the ball as well as you're watching my tits,
you could have made the playoffs.
I wanna have an article on her site someday.
My God. Will you look at this?
Suze gets invited to cool shit. I miss all of it.
I miss everything. It's been so long since I've been to a party.
Or made out with a guy. I don't even remember how. Like my tongue atrophied.
When my mom was my age, she had me. I've never had a boyfriend.
But you're a grown-up.
Take that back.
-Not even like a camp boyfriend? -I'm gonna end up like Kirsten.
Like buying thousand-dollar throw blankets and... sleeping with my computer.
That's why she's so mean. She's sleeping with a laptop. She needs to get laid.
-She needs to be made love to. -Well, Rick needs to get laid.
The two of them are always in this office. Let's lock them together
so they can have sex with each other.
Think about it. We Cyrano them out of the office.
And then when they're boning, we're free.
Well, I don't need to be free, I need to be promoted.
All I care about is that I'm not still an assistant when I'm 28 years old.
That's when it gets really sad.
-I'm 28. -I'm so sorry. [chuckles]
-For you. That's sad for you. -You should leave.
Bye.
-I made something. -What--?
You're so quiet. You move like a Prius.
-What is that? -It's a spreadsheet
of everything I know about Kirsten.
-What she likes, doesn't like. -I have no idea what this is for.
To set them up.
For our Cyrano.
-That was a joke. -But it doesn't have to be.
-What's Rick's favorite food? -The filet from Ai Fiori's.
-Where will he be at 3? -His son's school play.
-Hey, what does he hate? -"Geoff" spelled with G and sour cream.
We know everything about them. What they like.
We control their entire schedule. We are the men behind the curtain.
We can get them to do anything.
-This is very thorough. -Thank you.
-Absolutely not. -What?
-I thought-- -This is insane.
I barely have time to do my job.
-If Rick found out, he'd fire me. -He'd never find out.
-This could save us. -I gotta take my girlfriend to lunch.
-Should I send this to you? -Please don't.
Oh, Suze.
Suze.
Mm. Mm.
-I thought we were getting lunch. -Excuse me. Are those seats taken?
Yeah, sorry. They're taken.
Yeah, I know we were.
Rick needed me to save the seats. His son's the second lead.
I thought we could do a theater picnic.
Hey, you look amazing. How'd the, uh, thing go this morning?
Good. I booked that Old Navy campaign.
That is incredible.
Look, I'm gonna be traveling so much and you're already so busy.
No. I'm not busy.
I don't wanna be with a guy saving somebody else's seats.
I want the guy whose seats are being saved, you know?
-I think we should-- -No! [clearing throat]
I know this is annoying...
Ma'am, I would lay my life down for these. If you can't say the same, move on.
We can make this work.
I'm about to get promoted. My schedule will be easier.
Then our seats are gonna be saved.
I promise.
-Hey. -Excuse me.
-[boy] Hey, Dad. -Hey.
I like the beard.
-You got these seats? -Yeah.
You're gonna have to get me a masseuse. We're three centimeters from the stage.
What is wrong with you? I'll mess up my neck.
Oh.
Lot of hot moms here.
Holler.
I'm in.
When they're boning, we're free, right?
Where could they meet?
-Rick's usually at the District Club. -Okay.
-Could she run into him there? -Sure. She can run into him.
After she's nominated by two members, one former member, approved by the board.
Also has a sex change. Technically, women are allowed.
-I get it. -Rick cares about winning.
We just gotta make your boss seem like a business deal
or a softball game.
All Kirsten cares about is her site, her brand.
-It's like her baby. -She shouldn't have a real baby.
How dare you.
But I do think that's a huge part of it.
We need a meet cute. Like, every great romance has a meet cute.
Like, getting stuck in an elevator or something, but...
-Let's get them stuck in an elevator. -How would we do that?
You don't know Creepy Tim?
A succulent.
Can you grow plants down here?
Oh, no. They just slowly die.
Oh.
So, buddy, we wanted to shut down the elevator
so two people could fall in love.
Charlie...
the only thing I love more than love is love in enclosed spaces.
And succulents.
And you already gave me one of those, so, my answer is yes.
Falcon One's headed to the Nest. We are a go for Pandora's Box.
You're not in the Secret Service. Say "elevator."
-We're a go for Pandora's Box. -Copy that.
[Harper] There she is.
Okay, can you stop at her floor?
Say something.
What?
Does no one look each other in the eyes anymore?
Oh.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who's this guy? -You need to go, sir.
-Make your way out. -Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
-[both] Call it off. -It's go time.
-What the hell? -What did you think?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, no.
Can you start it back up?
Thank you, God. I'm extremely claustrophobic. That would've been bad.
But you work on a truck.
Let it go, Rick.
Your job is to ride elevators. How are you claustrophobic?
I usually take the stairs. But today was a big day.
Okay, let's not make it any worse.
-Why did you do that? -That wasn't me.
This might be an actual system malfunction.
Oh, my God.
This has never happened before. Oh, irony, you fickle queen.
Yup. This is how it always starts in my nightmare.
Here we go. All right. We just all need to calm down.
-Uh, what are you doing? -What is he doing?
Is it getting hot in here?
Stop doing that, please. Stop now.
-I need to be free of this. -Stop that.
Okay.
The pants are off. I'm calling the firefighters.
Don't. I'm calling the real police.
Okay, this button is designed for this emergency.
You want the emergency response team,
not the jackoffs assigned to the Elevator Squad.
No. Maybe we can make a rope.
You're not gonna get service. It's already ringing.
-Excuse me. -If we press it at the same time,
-it'll confuse the system. -[Kirsten] It was ringing.
I gotta pee. I'm gonna pee.
If you pee, I will end your life.
Stress incontinence. That is a real condition and you are not helping.
I'm gonna listen to my body.
Oh.
[both] Don't pee.
Pee.
-Do not pee in there. Do not pee in the-- -It's too late. I'm dripping.
Shh.
Ah.
Hello.
I'm not great at reading rooms, but I can tell that was a success.
It was okay.
-Are you kidding? -Hmm?
That was a disaster. They hate each other.
Hate, we can work with. Hate is not the opposite of love.
Know what the opposite of love is?
-Ice. -Indifference.
Well, that's also very true, Creepy Tim. [gasps]
-Uh... -People call me Creepy Tim?
No.
I love it.
Your dry cleaning's in the car,
and I forwarded you Jeff's itinerary for the Simone Biles profile.
Oh.
And, also, apparently some guy you were stuck in the elevator with
asked security for your contact info.
-Was it the delivery man? -No.
Um, some big shot in the building.
I guess he has a crush on you.
But don't worry, I told them we do not give out your number, okay?
I heard you got stuck in an elevator with that sports reporter. Kirsten...?
Kirsten Stevens. I knew I recognized her from somewhere.
Kirsten Stevens.
I think Mark Cuban is thinking about investing in her site.
Hmm.
I did it. What now?
[Harper] Does Rick have good Yankees tickets?
No, he watches from the bleachers like a peasant. He does.
[Harper] Charlie?
Hi, I'm so sorry.
So sorry. I got here so early that I thought I had time to dick around,
so I went there, lost track of time
-and was late. -That's the dumbest thing I've heard.
-That is not a real thing. -It is.
It's the over-dick-around thing. I over-dicked it.
-Why are you wearing that? -I'm going to a baseball game.
Why are you wearing that?
I'm not on the team. Why would I wear the jersey?
-I don't wear scrubs to the doctor's. -I'll get nachos.
I've made a mistake.
[Harper] What are you doing? Come on!
-[Harper] Bobby? -[Bobby] Harper?
[Harper] Hey, I need a favor. We need...
the people...
in these two seats right here to make out.
-What do they look like? -One is a beautiful woman with dark hair
and a fierceness that's both scary and inspiring.
The other is a guy.
-You know I can make this happen. -Good.
[announcer] Number 40, Luis Severino.
Yankees' 24-year-old Dominican pitcher is on the mound to start.
So, Rick's here. If you see the...
-You see the U? He's right above. -Do you have a telescope so I can see him?
-Are seats this far back legal? -These are the best.
There's a community here. And you can see the whole field.
And there's Dennis.
Hi, sweetheart. How you doing?
Dennis introduced me to the Gerilympics. He's a heavy weightlifting champ.
-What does he bench, negative 10? -I heard that, you little pissant.
I'm old, not deaf.
-Is that your boyfriend? -Absolutely not, Dennis.
Good.
[announcer] Now batting, Red Sox number 16, Andrew Benintendi.
[Harper] Let's frigging get that!
I'm gonna take a picture of you and post it on Tinder.
You know, guys love girls who like sports.
-Are you kidding me? -They do.
They think they like girls liking sports. They like a girl in a tight sports jersey
serving wings and getting terms wrong.
Guys like girls who like guys who like sports.
-Got it? Oh! -Kirsten's here!
[announcer] Number 31, Aaron Hicks steps into the batter's box.
-Hey. -Oh, hi.
-This is a weird coincidence. -Here we go.
-I hope you took the stairs. -How else would I get here?
No, I mean, because nobody-- Nobody peed.
-You know? -Ah. Yes.
Yeah.
-You here by yourself? -Uh, I'm supposed to meet a colleague.
Yeah, me, too. An investor. I guess he's stuck in traffic.
-[announcer] Swings and misses. -[Kirsten] Come on!
-You know his slider drops like that! -Be elite! Come on!
[man] Ice-cold beer! Get your ice-cold beer here!
You're welcome to take this seat until my colleague gets here.
It's the best seat in the stadium.
Actually, it's just the most expensive seat.
From where I'm sitting, you hear both coaches better.
But you're welcome to sit here until my colleague arrives.
[announcer] Single down the right field line, the Yankees score a run.
Thank you.
Wait. Oh, yeah! That is what I'm talking about!
[announcer] All right, Yankees fans, pucker up.
-It's happening. -Come on.
All right. It's Kirsten and Rick! I told you he'd find them.
All right. Come on.
Come on.
-[announcer] No need to be shy. -We're not together. We're just...
-They're not gonna kiss. -What?
-[announcer] We're waiting. -Come on.
Share the love.
They were nervous. If they gave them more time...
I know, I know.
-[announcer] How about you guys? -[Charlie] Give them more time!
Boo!
-[announcer] That's the spirit. -Boo!
What's your problem?
-Who are you? -For a different reason.
[announcer] Who's next? There we go. There we go.
[announcer] And back to our first couple. Care to reconsider? Last chance.
No, okay. Oh, kiss, kiss. It's the law!
[Harper and Charlie] Kiss, kiss, kiss.
-Kiss, kiss, kiss. -[crowd booing]
-Oh, my God. Why? -I don't know.
Should we send them popcorn or something?
[announcer] And a kiss for Mom. Sweet.
-Come on. Come on. -Come on.
-[all chanting] Kiss, kiss, kiss. -We did it already.
Kiss, kiss, kiss.
-Kiss, kiss, kiss. -All right.
Kiss, kiss, kiss.
-Yeah! -Yes!
We have no e-mails.
Well, it's hard to bark orders when your tongue is down someone's throat.
-That's true. -We're free. The world's our oyster.
-We're free. Have fun with Suze. -You, too.
-Are you taking the--? -You taking the 4?
Kind of wasted that high-five.
Hello.
Any sports moments make you cry?
Yeah.
Oh, my goodness. Who are you?
I'm sorry, Kirsten, the 3 train stalled, then there was a new barista,
and she didn't know the milk your coffee-- She didn't...
-Rick's not here. -[Harper] Neither is Kirsten.
What if a psychopath saw them on the Kiss Cam
and followed them home and murdered them?
Legally, where are we in that scenario?
Please, I have watched enough Law & Order to know that we are absolutely,
-100 percent, no doubt about it-- -Morning.
I could use some coffee. You mind getting me a flat white?
Would I mind?
It'd be my honor.
Harper, my office.
-I spent the night with a man. -A man. You spent the night with-- Hmm?
Oh, wow, that's amazing. You get it, girl.
We did not sleep together. We did everything but.
I'm not the kind of person who sleeps with people on the first date anymore.
-Right. -I guess it had been a while.
Longer than I realized.
I don't think they should hear that.
The waiting was almost tantric.
What?
Even when he was being gentle,
I could sense a possibility of strength in his touch.
Kind of like when Koko was petting that tiny kitten.
Just like petting it, petting it, petting it.
Let's bullhorn.
-Okay, tell me something I don't know. -Yeah, I did not know that.
-Charlie, Kirsten just left. -So did Rick.
It's daylight.
I know. Okay. I'm getting out of here before Kirsten comes back,
and this was all some terrible prank.
I have a date with some guy that I messaged last night,
-and we're gonna go mini-golfing. -That's a terrible idea.
Why is that a terrible idea?
You have Dave Matthews' concentration face.
-No, I don't. -Mm, I saw you write cursive one time.
Go, have fun. Let him win a few holes.
Excuse me. I only have one hole.
-Oh, my God. I meant at golf. -So did I.
Hey, you're home before me. Did you quit?
No, I got off early.
Making Suze some dinner.
So, uh, Suze is coming over. That's nice.
Why did you say it like that? Why'd your voice go up?
'Cause, you know, she, uh... She sucks.
-What? -If you take away her face and her boobs,
you realize she's not saying anything.
That's the most heterophobic thing I've ever heard. You just don't know her.
-How well do you know her? -I know everything about Suze, all right?
-We talk all the time. I text her all day. -Like?
She's from Puerto Rico. She's a model. She uses La Mer products.
She doesn't like dairy. There you go.
All right. Well, what do you do if you wanna have an intimate,
meaningful conversation with somebody?
-I talk to you. -That's not what I'm for.
That's what your girlfriend's for. To be your best friend.
You're my best friend. I've never pooped at her apartment.
Whose fault is that? Should've did that the first date. Mark your territory.
[Harper] I barely-- I don't have health insurance,
but Gronk got wasted at a Christmas party.
-[man] You seriously have the dream job. -Well, Kirsten has the dream job.
-I love Kirsten Stevens. So cool. -Yeah.
-Wait, what's she like? -She's--
-Well, she's great. She's great, really. -Yeah?
She's so smart and hard-working. Kind of inspiring.
-Inspiring? Okay. -Yeah. Yeah.
-Here we go. -Let's do this.
-That didn't go. -You letting me win to boost my ego?
I wanna destroy you. I'm trying not to make my concentration face.
Oh, no. Why don't I just stand behind you, and you can make whatever face you want.
-Okay. Okay. -Okay. Cool. Yeah.
Oh, my goodness. [chuckles]
-Well-- -I hope that was your golf club,
because it felt extremely small.
-[laughing] -That's not the right thing to say.
-Harper? -Mm-hm?
My phone is broken. Voice messages aren't coming through.
Oh, really?
-Mm-mm. It works fine. -There is something wrong with it!
Oh.
Okay.
-You know what's crazy? -I don't care.
-Just how different dating is nowadays. -Why are you still talking?
You know, you used to have to wait three days to call,
but now women think the longer you take...
the smaller your penis.
Get out.
-This is an elevator. -Get out.
I've got it.
Hey, there.
Please hold for Rick.
[Rick] And now I'm seeing this badass bitch. She's a journalist.
[Kyle] Good. Dating is so much better now. Everybody's sexting and waxing.
[Rick] You know, and Kiki, she never shaved, just to punish me.
I mean, if I see any hair on a woman, I'm out. See you.
-So? -Kirsten needs to get a bikini wax.
Oh, [chuckles] okay. Hello to you, too. Excuse me?
Just tell her to get one. You're girls. You talk about that.
Oh, right. I forgot that every morning I walk in,
I hand her her latte, and then we talk about merkins
and the cyclical popularity of the full bush.
-What's a merkin? -It's a pubic hair wig.
A wig for the pube region.
You know, I miss the time when I didn't know what that was.
There we go.
Oh, uh, okay. Tomorrow morning, you have that salon appointment.
-What? What salon appointment? -I mean, the one for the bikini wax.
-Bikini wax, when did I make that? -You made that ages ago.
Just like an annual checkup, general upkeep.
-What salon? -The one you told me to make it at.
-Exhale? -Bliss--
Exhale.
She gonna clear out the brush, the bush brush.
Clear out the bush and brush and just make it as smooth as a baby.
To have a baby. You don't need one of those.
The babies or the bush or the brush.
I have so many calls.
But if we hadn't have intervened, Rick would have called her too late,
and Kirsten's lack of waxing would have turned him off,
and there would have never been a second date.
-Okay. -We can't just kick them out of the nest,
because they're baby birds, and they are careening to their death.
-We have to actually Cyrano them. Yeah. -Absolutely. Totally.
I mean, that's what we've been doing up to now.
-That's what we should continue to do. -You know what Cyrano means, right?
Yeah, I'm not an idiot.
So, what is it?
It's when-- So, if like two assistants were setting up their boss--
-I don't know what Cyrano is. I know. -You don't know it. I've said it 14 times.
-[laughing] -I thought I knew when you said it,
-and then it was too late to ask. -Okay. It's when a nerdy guy
helps a handsome guy date the girl that he loves
by telling him what to say, what to do.
That is not what we're doing. We're full-on Parent Trapping.
-No, we're not. -I've seen the Lindsay Lohan classic
enough times to know that we're Parent Trapping hard.
No, Charlie, the point is, we can't just set them up,
we have to help them keep dating.
Yes, that one. He's an ass man.
Mr. Otis said you can wait in the lobby.
Don't walk like that.
There are two kinds of compliments to give a woman.
The things she thinks about herself but needs confirmed,
and the thing she doesn't think anybody notices about her.
The second kind matters more.
Charlie. I'm gonna be in late tomorrow.
I'm taking the rest of the day.
Ooh.
I took a nap today. A nap.
-Are you ready to order yet? -Not yet.
-But I'd love some more chips. -Sure.
Naps are great. But I got a bigger situation on my hands, Charlie.
Becca's engagement party is next weekend. I need to guarantee that I can be there.
It's really important for me, okay? Here's my plan.
Get Rick to invite Kirsten on a romantic weekend getaway trip to Nantucket.
There's a wine festival next weekend, and you're gonna plant all the information
and make Rick think that he thought of it, but he didn't, we did.
-Okay? -Okay.
And they're gonna be marooned on an island with limited cell service,
which means you and I will have an entire weekend to ourselves.
Perfect. Suze's modeling agency is throwing this fancy party next Saturday.
I'll show up, throw out pheromones.
-Let everyone know she's got a boyfriend. -Don't say the word pheromones around me.
I'm sorry. I meant, uh, chemicals secreted in my sweat to attract females
-to my throbbing DNA. -No, no.
Is that--? What--? Can you just--?
You should probably be easier on the "ha ha has."
Hmm?
I mean, you find him humorous. You're not a psychotic clown.
Psychotic clown, what are you talking about?
If you like Golf Guy, you'll go out with three other guys this week.
-[chuckles] Okay, why? -Remember when you were a kid?
If you had three salamanders, you played with each of them every day,
and they'd live for years.
But when you had one salamander, and you held it and you loved it,
and you played with it, and it just died immediately.
No.
Well, men are kind of like that.
You put too much focus on him, he can sense it,
then you're gonna accidentally kill him. Then you gotta hide him in your drawer
-so your mom doesn't find out. -I like my one salamander.
Okay, let's get out of here.
-Wait. We haven't even ordered yet. -Hello? No. I better get out of here.
-It's an emergency. -What?
-Well, I was just about to order and pay -[gasps] It's an emergency.
for my dinner at this very nice restaurant,
but I guess I'll just rush straight to the hospital.
-Thank you. -An emergency.
Oh, my God, the whole leg?
[Charlie] These things always happen when you least expect it.
[waiter] I mean, I saw your phone not ring.
It's not legally a crime, but we both know this isn't right.
Why do I only have a 2D printer? What am I, a caveman?
There's too much paper here! This is the digital age!
I'll have you know, my tongue is no longer atrophied.
-Code red, code black, code-- Shit. -Code red, I can't tell what that means,
-but code shit, I feel like that's bad. -[Kirsten] Change of plans.
I won't go out of town.
Make sure they know the office has to be open all weekend.
Um, of course.
-Is everything okay? -Obviously. Why would you ask me that?
Well, no reason.
I am a successful woman. I don't need to travel
with a pathetic man-child who can't even feed himself.
Of course not.
Here's a riddle. Would you tell me you love Korean barbecue
if you've never had it and didn't know what it was?
No.
And if we went there, would you refuse to let me explain how it works,
eat raw meat, rather than admit you're wrong,
and blame me when you threw it up on a hot grill?
Never.
Kirsten, do you want your--? No, okay.
A lot of men proposed to me in my 20s. I could be thrice divorced by now.
But I'm not gonna pretend to let him teach me about how the world works
just so he can get it up!
He's such a jerk.
I'm worried that your abrasiveness and general demeanor
will hinder you in the workplace.
You put a plate full of raw beef in front of me,
I think it's tartare, and I'm the idiot? [scoffs]
I'm sorry if I expect my food to be properly cooked
whilst I sit in a restaurant. What am I, a chef? Uh-uh.
-Do I got a Michelin star? -You could if you wanted to.
She did this shit on purpose to make me look stupid.
This was a power play.
I don't think she tried to power play.
Can't get the image of barbecued vomit out of my head now.
This shitty computer isn't taking my password.
-That's my-- -Take my password!
That's my laptop.
Bring me my laptop.
How could you let them pick the restaurant?
-It was your turn to choose. -No, you chose last time.
Damn it.
Rick is worse than before.
-He tried to fire a mailman today. -My God.
-Mailmen work for the U.S. government. -Get them together before they kill us.
I can feel it in my bones that Kirsten is capable of murder.
-[exhales] So, what are we gonna do? -I don't know.
It's your turn to figure something out.
Why isn't there anything in my calendar at 2 p.m.?
You know I need a hard out after family events.
Oh, my. I'm so sorry. I didn't know that your lunch was with family.
-I'll figure it out right now. -If I pay you to make my life easier,
but instead, you make it harder, you're useless to me.
Do you understand?
So, bad news is, Kirsten ripped me a new one.
Good news is I now have time to see Golf Guy.
-Mm. -What is this? Charlie?
-Oh, my God. -This is Rick's son's science project.
Life gave me lemons, and I used it to battery-power lemonade.
Can you... fix it?
No. It was a masterpiece, and now he's not even getting a ribbon.
Go, get out of here. Save yourself.
-Good luck. -Thank you.
We need a new project. Whole new thing.
-Yeah. -What about Golf Guy?
I don't wanna squeeze my salamander too hard.
I honestly did not know that someone could do this to lemons with their bare hands.
[Charlie laughing] Rick was so pissed.
Imagine if a duck were on meth, it was like, "Hey, Charlie. Charlie."
-Sounded like that duck. -Why do you work for this guy?
-Why don't you just... quit? -Are you insane?
I've spent three years doing every shit errand imaginable.
Can't quit.
I'd have to start all over, and all of this would've been a waste.
Plus, Rick is the most respected VC of all time, so if he makes me an analyst,
-I can get a job anywhere. -But do you like the actual work?
Nobody likes the actual work. That's the job.
Do the best one where you make the most money.
Hmm.
Okay, why do you work for Kirsten?
I work for Kirsten because I wanna write the articles that made me cry
when I was a little girl, and Kirsten's the best sports journalist there is.
Well, has she read any of your stuff?
I haven't written anything or finished writing anything.
My days are so long and so exhausting
it's like when I have time, everything I write is... bad.
-That is probably not true. -It is true.
I think I wanted to impress her and I wanted her to like me,
so, it's just like, I worked so hard at being this great assistant
and making sure she was happy that...
I don't know, feels like I might have lost any writing skill I ever had.
Well, that is definitely not true.
You're a terrible assistant.
Can you pass me a few of those?
-You ready? -I'm ready.
-What? -Yeah.
Holy shit. How does that work?
Well, the bonds in the milk connect with the DNA in the--
I have no idea. I'm not a scientist.
All the supplies are in the bag. Feels like a winner.
This isn't as good as the lemons.
[Charlie over phone] He wasn't happy, but he didn't break anything,
-so, maybe that's an improvement. -[Harper] Well, technically, he's right,
but given the fact that we did that in the night,
-Magic Milk should win a Nobel Prize. -[Rick] Charlie!
Yo!
-Oh, my God. I think Rick's drunk. -What?
I've never seen him drunk before. He's violent when he's sober.
-Charlie--? -[line disconnects]
-Yeah. -Do it with me, white boy.
Yeah. Get over here, you dig it? Come on, man.
Come on.
[singing] Charlie chicken and grits
Huh!
You don't know that shit.
Um...
You're a good guy.
Do you know that?
-For real. -What?
I appreciate you.
And I should tell you that more often.
Good idea. Let's have another drink.
-Okay. -Oh, no. No, no, no. I got it.
I hate losing, Charlie.
And she thinks I'm a loser.
What should I do?
You're a person.
What would you do?
-Apologize. -No. Next.
Tell her she's good at her job. Tell her you respect what she does.
Just tell her you see her.
Ew.
-What does that even mean? -I don't know.
I think maybe it's just... Maybe it's just what I'd wanna hear.
Hmm?
Hey.
-What are you doing here? -[clears throat]
I see you.
What? What does that even mean?
I see you.
"I see you," like--
I see you.
-Oh. Lock the door. -Mm-hm.
Yes, ma'am.
I meant that as a joke.
You're the boss.
Let's go to your apartment. I'm serious. [laughs]
Rick.
-[Harper] Charlie? -I want rose petals everywhere.
I need it to look like a massacre at a flower shop.
Nantucket is a go. They land in an hour, I put the champagne
-on Rick's credit card. Here you go. -Hotel room is all set.
-It's about to be Boner City in there. -Wow, okay.
Someone say Boner City? Frigging love that place.
Harper, this is Duncan. My roommate.
He's a teacher at a middle school in the Bronx.
But he's gay, so, keep your ovaries in your pants.
-I'll just shove them back in there. -[Charlie] What are you--?
-Why are you dressed like that? -For Becca's engagement party tonight.
What are you wearing? Where are the rest of your shorts?
These are cool, all right? Suze likes short shorts on guys.
-Stop. -[laughing] Your shorts suck.
You know what, stop it. You're not friends.
-I feel like we're becoming friends. -We're friends.
-Do you wanna come to this party? -I don't think so.
I gotta finish writing this article to distract myself.
Distract yourself from what?
The fact that Golf Guy hasn't called me in a few days.
-Like zero contact? -Yeah, but he'll call me soon,
'cause he said he was gonna come to Becca's party tonight.
-Whatever. It's not like I care. -It's gonna be fun.
-Duncan? -[Duncan] Free booze and hot dogs.
-You've convinced me. I'll be there. -Perfect. She's my plus one.
You're my plus one. I'm Suze's plus one. You're a plus two.
-So, she's my plus three. -I'm his plus three.
What?
[announcer] DJ JC, kicking it live on the dance floor.
-Yes! -Oh, my God.
-[Charlie] You see all the hot guys? -[Duncan] Don't do that.
Everybody's so tan. Oh, my goodness. Look at you. You look so pretty.
Duncan, you know Suze.
I heard you were coming, and I still showed up, so...
-Harper. -I'm Harper.
-Oh! -[Harper screams]
-How are you doing this? -I get you every time. Yeah.
Stop. Stop hugging each other. You are not friends.
We're killing it.
Do you guys know each other?
It's like Battle of the Bulge over here. It's a war zone.
-Hey, Charlie. -He's not gonna call you,
-and it's not a big deal. -I slept with him.
I don't do that with many people. Thanks, Duncan.
First guy I ever slept with came out while he was inside of me.
I hate to be the one that has to explain this.
-That's actually how sex works. -That's not what she's talking about, bro.
-He came out as a gay man. -While he was inside you?
Yeah, you know, it's kind of like you don't really know until you tried it.
And then, once you tried it, you really know.
Wow.
Well, you know what? Golf Guy wasn't like that.
He was perfect.
I think your bar for perfect is really low.
Can we stop? We're gonna play a game called hard to get.
Hard to get? Makes no sense. It's evolutionarily unsound.
Why would a caveman want a cavewoman who was like, "Go get me food.
When you come back, maybe there'll be a cave for you,
maybe there won't be." Men should want women
that are gonna keep the coziest, warmest caves. Men need shelter.
-I am guaranteeing shelter. -Screw Golf Guy.
I did screw Golf Guy. That's why I'm having this frigging problem.
No, forget about him.
I will go with you to the party. I will be your other salamander.
What are you talking about? What about Suze?
She should see what it's like when her cave doesn't have any fire.
But I'm not the cavewoman. I am still the man.
Let's just go.
-You're getting married! -Hi! Hi!
-Hey, angel, I'm so sorry I'm late. -That's okay. I don't care.
-How do I look? That's what I care about. -How do you look? You look so beautiful.
-Really? -Incredible.
-Like slutty first Holy Communion, right? -Yes. Exactly.
-Is that Golf Guy? -No. This is Charlie, from work.
-Hi, Charlie from work. Nice to meet you. -Thanks for having me.
So, as most of you know, I have, um, dated a lot of guys.
-Hear, hear. That's my girl. -I've liked a lot of things about them.
Like, yeah. And then I met Mike over here,
and there was a lot to not like about him.
He, um, dresses like a stepdad, as you can see.
-He listens to Creed. -Just their old stuff.
-Non-ironically. -Okay, but they are good.
Every single time he hears a siren, he goes, "That's my ride."
This is super fun for me, by the way.
And yet...
Oh, man, I'm completely and totally in love with him.
When I was little, my grandmother, she used to say:
"You like because, and you love despite."
You like someone because of all of their qualities,
and you love someone despite some of their qualities.
Mikey... [giggles]
I like you almost as much as I love you, and I can't wait to marry you.
Okay, sorry. Get drunk so I have fun stories to tell.
[Harper] Wow, all the way to the top.
[Charlie] I don't think we need new shot glasses.
Thank you.
-Okay. -All right.
-Okay, to the last penis of my life. -That's me. That's me, yeah.
-Oh, yeah. -One, two, three.
That's my ride.
-He does do it every time. -I know.
-You're so good at that. -Oh, I'm just like Bruce Lee.
-I just don't even know what's going on. -Just stop thinking.
Nobody cares. Let's do it. Look at all these assholes.
Just imagine you're paralyzed,
and all of a sudden, you get feeling back into your limbs.
Now you're one of those blow-up air men outside a car dealership.
Yeah, that's--
Don't be weird.
-What's Rick and Kirsten's "and yet"? -What do you mean?
That "because, love despite" thing, when there are all these--
Um...
Like all these reasons why it shouldn't work out...
but they don't care. Like Romeo and Juliet.
Our families are mortal enemies, and yet...
-Rick and Kirsten don't have one. -Well, that's good, you know? We--
I mean, they can't not like anything about each other.
Not yet.
But even friendships have them.
Like, Becca's wild, and she drinks too much,
and she's never paid a bill on time, and yet I love her.
You like expensive stuff...
and let a 23-year-old walk all over you, and yet you're tolerable.
-I do not let her walk all over me. -I'm sorry. Where are your sunglasses?
You talk way too fast, and you are way too nice to everyone...
-except me, apparently... -[laughs]
-and yet... you are a terrible dancer. -That's not how it works.
I need pizza.
So, like, we're clearing the air, you know what I mean?
I probably had a few glasses of wine. It was like-- [laughs]
-Hi. -Hi.
-Oh, my God. -You're drunk.
-What? Me? -Yeah.
-You. -It was an accident.
-Mm-hm -But it was also incredibly on purpose.
-Angel. You're the love of my life, -Yeah?
and I'm so happy for you.
But there's no pizza on this roof, I have to go.
-Do you wanna come? -I can't.
-Sure? -I can't. But get out of here.
-Love you. -Love you.
-Charlie? -[Charlie] Huh?
It's time to go.
-Oh, man. Keep it real, though. -[Charlie] Miss you already.
-Where do you want these? -Oh, you can just put them on the table.
-You are gonna let the smell out. -I wish that box was my bed.
I know this is not gonna sound how I mean it to sound.
-I wanna fuck this pizza. -I get it.
You should never say that to anyone.
But I get it.
I'm sorry. Duncan's playing Third Eye Blind in there.
-What does that mean? -He's hooking up with a guy.
Duncan is gay?
What?
I'm kidding.
We cannot interrupt him.
Do you know how athletic I was?
Impressed yet?
I'm so hungry.
Too hungry.
Oh, God. Nope.
-Do you need some help? -Yeah.
-Give me the pizza. -No. I'm gonna take it up to the top.
Absolutely not, your hands are too small. Ah!
-Charlie. -I'll hold it in one hand.
I'm gonna move my way up this ladder like a monkey. Stop.
Stop. I got this.
-All right. -Oh, my God.
Stop. Keep the top up. Otherwise the cheese will slide.
-[laughs] -Please don't drop my pizza.
-What? Just stop making me laugh. -I'm serious.
-Stop making me laugh. -I'm not trying to. I mean it.
-Okay? -It is in my possession. I got this.
-[Harper] Oh, are you okay? -I'm fine.
No, I'm talking to my pizza.
[Charlie] Parkour.
This is the dining room.
Careful.
One, two, three.
Yes.
-Thank God. -That looks so good.
Just choose it.
Wow.
This is the best meal I've had...
in my entire life.
I should probably go...
home.
Slice for the road?
Two, please.
But roll it crust-side-out.
I'm a lady.
Hey.
Hi.
-What are you doing here? -You two, in my office, now.
[Rick] Charlie,
this is Kirsten.
-Kirsten's assistant, Helga. -Harper.
Hello.
You two should get to know each other because Kirsten and I,
we're getting married.
Wow.
-[Harper] Really? -That's great.
Amazing.
Wonderful. [chuckles]
We're flying to St. John's, we're gonna elope on the beach,
sunsets, all that romantic shit. We want you two to set it up.
Us. Of course. Obviously, because who else would do it?
-We can do that. -Sunset, St. John's.
How come you're not writing this down like Henrietta?
-What's going on? -Oh. Um...
We can make that happen.
-When do you wanna go? -Next Saturday.
Next Saturday?
That's so soon.
I'm gonna be gone for so long, there's gonna be little to do.
This is a good time to prep that draft
on the nonagenarians you were talking about.
Yes, please. That would be...
wonderful. [chuckles]
-Okay. -And, Charlie, I'm giving you a promotion.
What?
So, when we get back,
you can teach the new bastard for a few weeks,
-and bring him up to your level. -Absolutely.
Okay.
-[Rick] We'll make this legal. -[Kirsten] You're ridiculous.
[Rick] Give me some of that.
Now? Are you still here?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
All right. We can work from the District Club today.
Sir.
I wanna throw a big party to celebrate, um, when we're back.
Invite all the usual girls.
Maybe we should have a party before the wedding. What's on my agenda?
You have Mary's baby shower, but I canceled that for you.
-I'll go to that now. -You will?
I'll finally have something they'll wanna talk about.
Have a seat, Harper.
[stammers] You and--? Okay. All right. Sorry.
I'm gonna give you some advice.
Men don't wanna date you when you're beating them to a story.
But I have met someone who wants me to be strong.
And he likes that I'm successful. He's a goddamn unicorn.
I don't know. It feels like fate.
-I know that I've been cunty. -You haven't.
-Don't be those women that can't say cunt. -I am not.
I know I've been cunty. It's partly because you're young
and your skin bounces back, and it annoys me, but...
it's because I want you to succeed.
What do you mean?
I see so much potential in you.
But you have to have tough skin.
So, if I'm the most awful person when this shitstorm of an industry is hard on you,
I know that you'll be prepared.
MyChef Series A is gonna be such a disaster.
We're so smart we didn't invest with them.
Don't forget to tell Kiki.
-About MyChef? -No, dummy. About the wedding.
And the date. Six weeks before hers.
Is she invited?
Send her a big bouquet of daisies. She hates daisies.
With a note that says, "Ha, ha.
I'm gonna beat you to the altar. But tonight, we're gonna knock boots
like we did on that Swiss gondola."
-And, obviously, -Um, what?
tell Kirsten I have a meeting or something tonight.
Well... I just thought, uh--
I thought you were gonna marry Kirsten.
Yeah, I am. Which reminds me. This week, go to a ring spot
and get a ring so big, you can see that shit from space.
Food here sucks.
Charlie, you did it.
What? Well, I didn't.
I did it. We both did it.
What are we talking about?
I know this started out selfishly for us, but we made two people fall in love.
We made two miserable people happy.
I thought best-case, they'd date for a month.
But they actually really like each other. We changed their lives.
I'm proud of us. I think we did something really good.
Me, too.
So, I was looking at the, uh, Caneel Bay Resort.
They have a, uh, slot next Saturday.
Will you come help me pick out the ring?
Absolutely not. I gotta go to the office, drop off these things.
Please? You're better at this than me.
I need female expertise. You know what Kirsten likes.
You're beautiful. You're charming. You are witty.
-You are clever-- -Okay, fine. [laughs]
Yes! Great. If you're going back to the office,
can you grab Rick's personal Amex on my desk?
[Rick] You gotta warn me if you're gonna send me photos like that when I'm at work.
Oh, no, no. Of course I want them.
I don't wanna show them to a bunch of Japanese bankers.
Okay. Tonight, you need to wear that red dress.
Because you look so hot in that dress.
I can't concentrate.
[Kiki] Good. I don't work this hard on this body for it not to be a distraction.
We're not married anymore. You can't tell me what to wear.
Can we try that thing we did on our honeymoon?
-You think you could see this from space? -[laughs] Yes.
-Hi. -Oh, is this the lucky lady?
How do you think Kirsten feels about blood diamonds?
Uh...
Here. It was so weird when I got the card.
I heard Rick flirting with somebody on the phone.
I think Kirsten's in a meeting. What do you think that was?
I-- What I think it probably was,
he likes to leave like a super-sexy little voicemail for her to listen to.
And hear later.
-I... -Yes.
think Kirsten likes topaz. Do you think she likes topaz?
Sure. Do you think Kiki likes topaz?
She didn't mention it when she and Rick were having phone sex.
-You tricked me. That was entrapment. -You just admitted it.
-You lied to me. You knew. -It's one time. It was a mistake.
-Doesn't mean anything. -After everything we did--
He's confused. He just needed to get it out of his system before the wedding.
The wedding? They can't still get married, Charlie.
Oh, this is for a wedding. I actually have a great selection.
We need one minute. Thank you.
Harper, we can keep this from her. We control their phones, e-mails.
We're the men behind the curtain. She doesn't have to know.
You wanna help Rick cheat on Kirsten?
We have faked their entire relationship.
Now one thing goes wrong, it's a crime to suddenly work behind the scenes?
No.
It was never okay.
But now you're willing... to ruin somebody's life
just so you can keep dating some boring girl
and work longer hours in a job that does not matter.
Whose life am I ruining? Theirs?
-They had no lives. We gave them lives. -Oh, my God.
[chuckles] You're worse than Rick.
Rick is-- He's a selfish, superficial asshole, but he can't help it.
You could be a good person, but you wanna be an asshole.
You're so obsessed with getting promoted
and becoming Rick. You're choosing to be a piece of shit.
Stop pretending this is some moral dilemma.
You are afraid not to be an assistant anymore.
That's ridiculous.
Have you written anything with all this free time?
Anything? You finish one article or you just keep planning to?
I think you'd rather run around, getting coffee than sit down,
write something and find out you suck.
I'm telling Kirsten.
The whole truth.
All of it.
Harper.
No, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That was the--
You're not under arrest. Put your hands down.
We need to get the ring off. This happens all the time.
Not the part where you two collaborate to, like, trick your bosses
into dating and then it blows-- I wasn't listening.
Hey.
Uh, I'm sorry to just show up.
-You forgot this. -Thanks. Honestly, you saved me.
If I have to hear another woman talk about
how much her nipples changed since giving birth, I'll kill myself.
I swear to God, Harper.
I walked in here with a fiancé, and suddenly, I'm a member of a club.
They wanna talk about having kids.
-First, I have to be a stepmother. -I don't think you should be a stepmother.
I don't think you should marry Rick because you don't actually like him.
-Of course I do. I love him. -No, you don't.
This whole thing, your whole relationship, it's not real.
What are you talking about?
-Rick's assistant and I set you up. -No, you didn't.
We shut down the elevator so you'd meet. The Yankees game,
I got you on the Kiss Cam. And when you guys broke up...
we told him what to say.
Nantucket, the flowers, that was us. We made you think you liked each other.
You don't know this guy. You don't like him. What you feel for him, it's not real.
You have no idea what is real.
You think you understand the intimacy of a relationship?
You're 25. I don't care how it started.
-He doesn't see you. He-- -Stop...
talking.
You're fired.
What?
Get out.
Tickets booked?
Uh... Yeah. Yes.
They are.
For the wedding.
Cool.
-[woman] Kirsten Stevens' office. -You don't wanna talk,
-but hear me out. -Who is this?
Harper?
I'm covering Kirsten's desk. Can I help you?
No.
Thank you.
Coming to drinks later?
We thought the market cap was overvalued.
We looked at college towns, and surprisingly...
You gotta be better.
This is not working.
Mom, it turns out touring wedding venues is so much more fun than touring colleges,
because of all the free food and booze out--
Oh, I gotta call you back.
Oh, my God.
It is like a tornado hit a Chinese--
Hey, are you okay?
Why are you not at work? Harper.
Because I got fired.
Really?
That's amazing.
Congratulations.
Right?
Are you okay?
I spent so much time there.
And I never wrote a single article.
Now Kirsten hates me.
And she'll never help me.
I'm bad at this. I've been trying to write the same article
for months, Becca.
And it's so bad I can't finish it.
Ow!
Of course your first draft is gonna be bad.
It's gonna be terrible. Then you know what you do, Harper?
You go back and you make it better.
But you can't make it better until you actually do it.
You're not a bad writer yet. Stop feeling sorry for yourself
and just write something bad.
Yes, Kirsten was mean. But you learned so much from her.
You just never had the time to use it.
And now, bud, you got the time.
So, get off your bony little ass and just do it!
-Okay. -Okay.
I'm gonna write...
the shittiest article ever written.
Yes. It's gonna suck ass. I can't wait to read it.
Okay. I got this.
Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay.
Are you cleaning this up? Are we gonna hire someone?
I am not leaving this chair until I write an entire article.
-Great. That's great news for me. -Can I get some free chips and water?
[Suze] I always wanted to eat here.
This is where Kim threw Kanye's half-birthday party.
Our best table.
This is exciting.
Mm.
Oh, my God.
This is the best meal I've ever had.
The best meal I ever had was a $5 pizza thrown up a fire escape.
What?
This sucks.
This whole place sucks.
It smells weird. It's far too quiet.
And this steak is delicious. It is not worth $70.
And you and I, we never talk about anything.
I don't want to wanna be an asshole.
You sound insane.
Just eat your steak.
If my 15-year-old self would see me now, he would punch me in the dick.
I don't wanna do this anymore, Suze.
But you're my backup.
Mm.
You know what?
Order whatever you want, on me.
What am I doing? You're not my girlfriend anymore. Give me that.
I'm not Rockefeller.
Harper. You were right.
We can't let them do this. I'm going to JFK.
Meet me at the terminal.
It's the cheap one.
Don't have time. Leaving the coat.
I need a taxi. I gotta get to the airport right now.
I gotta stop someone from getting married. Flight leaves in-- Oh.
I got, like, four hours.
And we've been to Times Square. What about museums? Should we go to the Met?
Do you like beautiful art that makes you re-examine what it means to be human?
-Yeah. -Then, yeah. The Met's worth it.
In fact, it may still be open if you go right-- Oh, my God.
I did the over-dick-around thing.
Sorry.
Rick?
Hey. Did I forget something?
Yeah. That you're a bastard.
I don't wanna be like you. I'm not gonna be.
I don't want the promotion. I quit.
Okay.
Kirsten? Don't marry him.
Do it, honey. Go with the young guy.
Oh, no. No, no.
I mean, she's a very handsome woman. Just--
-Not what's going on here. -Charlie. You're fired as fuck.
I literally just quit.
Kirsten, I know you don't know me, but I know you,
because all Harper does is talk about you.
And even when she's complaining about you, she's really complimenting you.
I know how hard you work and what a badass you are,
and I know you don't put up with any shit. So, don't put up with his.
I don't know what you think you're getting out of this, but you deserve better.
You are better.
Oh, my God. Gave myself goose bumps.
He's crazy. You realize that?
Hmm?
What's my favorite food?
Your favorite-- It's steak tartare.
It's green curry, you douche-tard.
She likes it medium-spicy from Thai Leaf on Broadway.
What's my favorite place?
Kiki, I ca-- [clears throat]
This is ridiculous.
Why are we--?
Kirsten.
Your name is Kirsten.
Squam Lake, New Hampshire, you douche-tard.
Charlie, I know you're no longer his assistant,
but could you please strike "wedding" from his calendar?
Absolutely.
Are you being serious?
No. Kiki's short for Kirsten.
I finished.
I finished.
The whole article.
I finished it.
From beginning to end.
I finished it. I finished the whole thing.
You, sir, are a hero and scholar,
and are about to receive the greatest tip in the history of the service industry.
Technically, I don't have my wallet on me. Tomorrow--
Leave this place and never return.
[whispers] I did it.
Hey.
-What do you want? -You live here?
It's disgusting.
Hold up. Hold up, hold up.
I'm sorry. I just--
I, uh...
I need some information on, uh, my wife. My ex-wife.
Like what?
Uh...
I got some written down here. Uh, assorted favorites,
as in, uh, favorite foods,
-flowers, clothing-- -Are you serious?
Look, I realize I should know this. But you used to do all this stuff for me.
I want her back.
I have an old Kiki file.
-I'll send it over to you. -[exhales]
Thank you. Thank you.
-Yeah. -Thank you.
-I really appreciate this. -Rick.
-You still work for this guy? -Nope.
It's soy. Nice seeing you, Rick.
[Charlie] Bye, Rick.
-Hi. -Oh.
Thank God you're here.
I can't find that piece on lesbian soccer players in Nigeria.
Probably in your "deleted" folder.
-I can't find Julie's number. -You made me change it
-to Satan in your contacts. -Come back to work.
What?
You crossed every line ever. I genuinely considered setting you up
for white-collar crime and just letting you rot in jail.
But I understand in some ways what you were trying to do.
You're not an unintelligent person.
I don't know how you did all this. This place is falling apart without you.
Come back and do it with me.
I learned so much from you.
You're my hero.
But if I wanna actually be a writer, I have to stop making excuses not to write.
So, I can't be your assistant.
But I'd love to help you find a new one.
You're fired again.
-I have to get my stuff. This is awkward. -Have you written anything?
Have I written anything? Yes. I have written something.
It's just-- It's right here.
Let's go over it.
-Tell me something I don't know. -Okay.
-"Twilight Champions." -Yeah, but that title is--
-No, I like it. I love the title. -I like it, too. I could like it.
This is about the geriatric Olympiads?
If I spend too much time on Gilda in the beginning,
people will know that she's gonna die. Let her death be a twist.
Hold off until after Harry wins his first med--
Hi.
Hi.
So, what are you doing here?
Oh, Kirsten told me to meet her. What are you doing here?
Oh, my God.
-She Cyrano'd us. -Yes, she--
I Googled it. So, I know what it means now.
Why are you dressed like that?
I don't work here anymore. I quit working for Rick.
Starting over. At 28.
Actually, I'm a temp, which is technically lower
on the totem pole than an assistant, which is kind of a kick in the nuts.
But it's, um, kind of cool. I get to see a bunch of different jobs.
Find out what I actually like.
I like you.
So, so much.
You're not hard to get at all.
You're hard to earn.
It's so much better.
You displayed a total lack of character when it mattered.
I know.
Charlie, you have the romantic and sexual personality of a seventh-grader.
Seventh? I feel like it'd be at least high school.
You wear suits to sports games.
What?
You're a know-it-all.
You are unbelievably bad at beer pong.
You're a sore winner. And you use too many exclamation points.
And yet...
I feel joy.
Maybe I love love in open spaces, too.

Breakfast, tractor driving, and shovelling...
[male radio host 1] Hey, big Boston Marathon,
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.
The wheelchairs go off by noon.
Temperature about 50. Partly sunny.
3:00, 55 degrees and light winds.
It's gonna be a perfect day.
[male radio host 2] You know, there is a renewed hope
for the Red Sox after two of the last plays...
[Jeff] Here we go, John. Feeling good about this year.
-You said it. -[Jeff] Go Sox.
Seriously?
Hey, Tom! Don't spray. I'm walkin' through here.
What's that smell?
-Shit. -[beeping stops]
-[sizzles] -Ah! Shit!
What'd you do?
[Jeff] The chicken on the timer,
I didn't turn on by mistake,
so I didn't hear the noise, I didn't hear the beep.
And if you hear the beeps, then you'd be able to stop 'em--
[Maya] You're supposed
to clear the roasters before you empty the trash, Jeff.
'Cause I didn't hear the beeps.
Okay, Maya, I'll sign off on an hour of OT, so Jeff can help clean up.
-Does that work for both of you guys? -Actually, sir, there's...
I'm not... I don't...
I have something I've got to do.
What have you got so important
you'd make this big mess and leave me here to clean it up?
Look, the Sox lost two in a row because of me, all right?
I missed both games because I was at work.
You know, I wasn't in my lucky seat with my lucky beer.
-[laughs] -You got a lucky beer?
Yeah, I mean, I just...
Beer in general's lucky, right?
Okay, this is your call, Maya.
[sighs] All right.
-[Maya] I got you. Look at you. -Thank you, Maya.
You owe me.
Do me a favour, sir.
Don't report our office romance, okay?
I know it's against Costco policy,
but sometimes you've got to make a sacrifice, right?
[Kevin] Please go watch the game.
[Patty] Here's my baby boy.
-Can I get another pitcher? -[Aunt Jenn] Don't you think
he's gettin' too skinny, Patty?
And he needs a fuckin' haircut.
Friggin' perfect.
Look at that face.
[Aunt Jenn laughs] The face is cute.
-Shit! -[both laugh]
Oh, Ma, hey.
-She's good. -[Jeff] Careful, there.
You wanna sit somewhere lower? That fall's a doozy.
Yeah, you go fuck yourself, sweetie.
All right, thanks. Hey.
[Aunt Jenn] He's my favourite nephew.
[Uncle Bob] Jesus, Jeff,
you still smell like fuckin' chicken carcasses.
Buchholz is on fire. Look at him.
[Big D] He's a fuckin' beast. [Jeff] That could've been you, D.
-On TV. Rich and famous. -Yeah.
Quit pitchin' in high school like a fuckin' pussy. [laughs]
You're a pussy. Shut up, faggot.
Nobody says "faggot" any more, D.
Oh, really? What do you know about it, huh?
What do you mean? I'm down with the homos.
-My boss at Costco's gay. -Your fuckin' boss?
You think I get this fashionable
without some sort of fuckin' insider help?
[Big D] For the record, hey...
For the record, I didn't pussy out of shit.
I had a herniated disk. You both know that.
-[Sully laughs] -[Big D] Shut the fuck up, both of you.
You're an asshole. Shut up.
Who you callin' a faggot, Derek?
No, apparently we don't say that word no more, Uncle Bob.
You know, Jeff's boss is a gay.
[Uncle Bob] What? He is!
[Jeff] Have you been... Where have you been?
[Big D] Not with the rest of us, apparently.
Bauman? You havin' a stroke or somethin'?
[Sully] Oh, shit. Look who's here.
Hey, give me a second.
Nobody wants to fuck a guy with chicken in his hair.
Why you touchin' my hair, Uncle Bob?
Come back after she tells you to go fuck yourself, okay?
Sit down and watch the game, bro.
She broke up with you.
Hey.
Hey.
-Are you-- -[Erin] What?
Are... [mouthing]
-The sister's here. -[Big D] Who? Gail?
-Yeah. -She looks good, though.
-Hey. -Hey.
I, like... I texted you,
like, six times. You never get...
Did you get my texts or not?
Yeah, yeah, I did. Yeah, I got 'em.
Cool.
-Hey, Gail. -Jeff.
So what are you two Amesbury ladies
slummin' it here for, anyway?
I'm collecting donations for the Marathon.
-No shit? -Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
-All right. -Yep.
You got a jar, huh? With pictures of yourself.
That's so great.
So you show people pictures of yourself
-and then you ask for money. -Yes. It usually works.
That's very... That's a smart idea.
It feels like you're self-promoting.
-That's really-- -I am.
That's literally what I'm doing.
Yeah, but you know what? Like, if you try and pass this
around with pictures of yourself,
it's gonna be like... It's... You shouldn't do that. You need my help.
-I already got-- -You're gonna need inside help.
Oh, really? Gonna give money or what?
No. Hey! Listen up!
Hear ye! Hear ye!
Give me a heart attack.
-Oh, no, no, no. -Citizens of Chelmsford!
[Erin] Jeff. Jeff.
This young lady here is running the Marathon
for Brigham and Women's Hospital. Okay?
Where she also works as a big-shot administrator.
So skip a round o' Stella, ya fat fucks!
-And donate to a good cause. -[all laughing]
-Yeah! -[all cheering]
Hey, listen.
Put your moolah in the fishbowl.
Just a couple o' bucks. All right?
Here ya go.
-She'll take food stamps... -[Gail] Stop smiling!
[Jeff] ... Chuck E. Cheese tickets, whatever you got.
-You are such a... -[laughing] What?
Whoever thought you'd end up being in, like,
this torrid melodrama with a chicken roaster from Costco?
[Erin] What do you have against him? He's a nice guy.
You broke up with him three times. Real nice.
Erin! E.
E, E, E, E! Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.
-[engine starts] -Can I come cheer ya on?
[Gail] Why don't you run it with her, Jeff?
Well, you know, I suffered an injury
from a chicken-related industrial accident today, Gail, so, you know.
But, hey, I'm gonna be there at the finish line for ya.
Don't the Red Sox play tomorrow?
-So? -So?
I'm gonna make a big sign for ya!
I mean, that's got to be worth at least a dinner, right?
-Bye, Jeff. -No, come on, I mean it!
I mean it. Hey, I'm gonna be there, all right?
[Gail] Take care of your finger, Jeff.
Hey, I'll be there, all right?
-[Erin] Dinner's pushing it! -You're gonna win it all!
E. E!
So lunch it is?
Oh, yeah. Go Sox.
It's too high.
God. Never again.
-Jeffrey! -[Jeff] What, Ma?
Will you get me some aspirin? 'Cause I can't reach.
[Jeff] Is there a... You have an orange marker?
-Ma! -Yeah!
There's an orange marker. It was right here.
-Don't make me shout, baby. -Never mind.
[Patty] Tiny mice with big hammers in my skull.
I can't reach the aspirin.
Ma, it's on the... [sighs]
I'm gonna be late.
My God. Why do you always put it up here?
Who puts it up here? I don't understand.
-Thank you, baby. -It's a new one. Yeah.
Okay. All right.
Hey, Can... Can you fix the chirpy thing?
-What? -Chirpy chirp.
What? You mean the low battery alarm on the smoke detector?
[Patty] Yeah, it's driving me bat-shit crazy.
That's not a long drive.
You can't have Uncle Bob come by and do it on his way to work?
Jesus Christ.
What you got there?
It's just a thing.
I don't know why you keep tryin' with that girl anyway.
[Patty] Hey, wait, I made breakfast.
[female reporter] More than 27,000 runners
are running in today's Boston Marathon.
The race is just now getting underway.
More than half a million people...
Oh, that's your brother?
What's... What's his name?
[Jeff] Go, Chris!
Is that guy runnin' in his underwear like that?
What's that about?
Ah!
[Brianna Keilar on TV] Coming up in a big plume.
We're hearing from one of our producers there on the ground
that it was this large bang on one side of the street.
What are they trying to do?
[Gail] Erin, are you okay? [Erin] I'm fine. I'm fine.
-Where are you? -[Erin] Just a bar.
-I don't know-- -How are you gettin' home?
[Erin] I don't know. My stuff is all back...
Thank God you're okay.
[Erin] Yeah. At the buses. It's back at the buses.
How are you gonna get your car keys?
[Erin] I don't know. [sighs] I don't know how to get there.
Stay where you are. I'll come find you.
Yeah.
[Matt Frucci on TV] At least five, six people hurt.
[Gail] Where can I meet you?
[Frucci] But I have a feeling there are more.
[Gail] Where can I meet you?
[female reporter] The photos. Injuries to those
in the blast area are quite severe.
Just a tragic scene here in Boston today.
[male victim on TV] Oh, my God.
Yeah, hello.
It's Patty, yeah.
[Aunt Karen] And you know they would've told you if he was dead, right?
How do you even know that, Karen?
[Aunt Karen] You know I spent my fair share of time in a goddamn hospital.
[Patty] Well, this ain't about you!
Didn't say it was! Jesus!
Will you two stop?
They're gonna be calling our name.
You can't right now. You can't.
[Big Jeff] Where's my son, God damn it?
-What the hell happened? -[Patty] Oh, Jesus Christ!
Where is he? Patty? What's goin' on with my son?
-[Uncle Bob] Calm down. -Don't tell me what to do, Bob!
Patty, what's going on with my son?
We don't know yet.
[nurse] Bauman family? [all] Yes!
-[nurse] Bauman! -Yeah, we're with...
We're with Jeff Bauman.
[panting] Right here. We're his family.
[Dr. Kalish] Mr and Mrs Bauman?
-Yeah. -Mmm. Yes.
I'm Dr Kalish.
-Jeff's alive. -[chuckles in relief]
-Your son's alive. -Yeah. All right.
Thank you, thank you.
[Dr. Kalish] So, Jeff came in bleeding with tourniquets on both legs,
and he was intubated right away
and then brought up immediately
to the operating room...
-[man] Hi. -I'm looking for Jeff Bauman.
Um, you're gonna have to sign in here.
Put his name here and we'll find out where he is.
Um, can you tell me if he's at this hospital, please?
[man] I... I can't tell you.
I saw a picture. I know he's at a hospital.
I just don't know which one.
Will you please just tell me what floor he's on?
It's crazy right now. I will help you.
[Dr. Kalish] Jeff underwent a double above-the-knee amputation.
Most of the destruction had actually already been done
by the bomb below the knees,
and it was very obvious to all the surgeons involved
that there was no way to salvage anything
below the knee.
We had to get higher than the knee to get clean skin,
clean muscle, clean tissue.
[softly] Oh, my God.
I've got to get something to drink.
Um, do you want me to get you a Coke, or chips, or something?
[male reporter on TV] Well, as they look through all these little pieces, Brian,
they think the bomb now was made by putting the components
inside a pressure cooker pot.
And in there were nails, BBs, and ball bearings
to magnify the destructive and injury-causing nature of the blast.
And the explosive was gunpowder.
[male reporter] Uh, the blast wounded more than 140 people...
[Big Jeff] Some guy asked me
if my son is still unconscious while I'm takin' a leak,
and I'm supposed to know this freak is a fuckin' reporter?
It ain't suspicious to ya? A stranger chattin' it up
while you got your dick in your hand?
Jenny, I was washin' my hands.
Shut the fuck up! You're fucking yelling about Jeff!
[Big Jeff] Ah, Jesus...
[Aunt Jenn] Stop talking about her son! [Big Jeff] He's my son, too.
[Aunt Jenn] It's hers. [Big Jeff] Shut up.
What do you want?
I'm so sorry to intrude.
[Uncle Bob] You're another reporter, aren't you?
[Big D] Don't let him in, Jeff.
I'm sorry. I'm, um, looking for Patty Joyce.
I'm Patty.
[Aunt Jenn] Did you not hear us?
-I'm Kevin Horst. Uh... -[Big Jeff] Who?
I'm Jeff's manager at Costco.
[Uncle Bob] Check his ID.
These reporters will try everything.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You... You called, right?
Yeah, Jeff talks about ya.
Well, ya heard what happened, huh?
Yeah.
You know our son lost his legs, right?
-I know. -And you brought breakfast?
-That's not helpful. -Uh, thank you very much.
[Big Jeff] Maybe we should wait to eat 'em
so you can go grab your camera.
Take a picture for your Costco newsletter.
I'm... Really, I'm happy to bring whatever you like.
[Big Jeff] What could you possibly get us that we need right now, Kevin?
Well, I took the liberty of printing up...
[Aunt Jenn] A fucking joke. You kiddin' me?
His policy and I've highlighted the areas
that you'll need to sign.
Don't sign nothin' without a goddamn lawyer!
Can you just let him talk for a second?
[Big Jeff] Who are you again?
[Patty] Yeah, shut the fuck up and let him talk.
[Big Jeff] What's he gonna say that we need to hear right now?
I don't know.
Okay, answer me this. Answer me this.
My son makes it through this, where's he gonna work, Kevin?
Where's he gonna work?
Hmm? You gonna hire him back?
Jesus Christ. We need this right now?
Yes, we do!
Who's gonna hire him without any legs, Patty?
[Kevin] We can't rehire him, sir.
See? I told ya.
Mr Bauman, please, let me finish.
We can't rehire him,
'cause he'll never have stopped working for us.
We're not letting Jeff go.
And these... This is stupid. But this is just...
You know, this is just to get the insurance goin'
and get that rollin'.
[Patty] Wait, insurance?
[Kevin] Yes.
Jeffrey has insurance?
Of course, of course. Um...
Plus legal, mental health, or financial advice
for Jeff or any member of the family.
And I've included my personal cell
at the top there. Um...
All right, good.
That's good. I'm glad you guys are doin' the right thing.
[Uncle Bob] So, what kind of muffins we got there?
[commissioner on TV] All of those things happened
in preparation for this event.
But there was no specific intelligence that anything was going to happen.
At this point in time, it's too early to get into the specifics.
These were powerful devices that resulted in serious injuries.
[male reporter] Do you have someone in custody?
[commissioner] Those reports are not true.
There is no suspect in custody.
We're questioning many people,
but there is no one in custody at this point in time.
Jeff?
Holy shit. Are you awake, bro?
You hear me?
Okay. Okay, okay.
Uh, so I've got to tell ya, there was an explosion.
And your fuckin' legs,
they're gone, bro.
What are you doin', buddy?
I can't tell what your fingers are doin'.
What, you wanna write somethin'?
Hold on.
Here, buddy, here. Here's a pen.
Yeah, grab that.
Erin? Erin, yeah, she's fine, she's here. She's...
The whole family's here. Everyone's down the hall.
You okay? How you feelin'?
"Lieutenant Dan"?
You mean the guy from Forrest Gump with no legs?
Oh, shit. Don't move.
Bob, Bob, wake up!
What the hell, D?
-Jeff's awake. -Huh?
He wrote this.
-The last part. -Holy shit.
-What happened? D? -[Big D] He's awake.
[Uncle Bob] Where's the FBI office? [Big Jeff] Bob.
[Uncle Bob] Hey! [Big Jeff] Bob.
[Uncle Bob] Hey! [Big Jeff] Bob.
Hey!
Hey!
-[Patty] Jeffie. [shushing] -[indistinct chatter]
Cut it down, guys. 'Cause he just... Just...
Jeffrey? Hey, baby.
Oh, my God, we are so happy you're back with us.
Um, uh, now listen,
some of the FBI guys are gonna come in.
They're gonna ask ya, you know, a... A few questions.
So... Okay?
And all ya got to do is just tell 'em what ya saw.
That's great.
[nurse 1] We're removing the intubation tube.
We need everyone to clear out.
[Patty] But we just got...
[Aunt Jenn] We'll be back.
We're just getting ready to take the breathing tube out.
-It'll be okay. -[Patty] See ya later.
[Aunt Jenn] It'll be okay. [Big Jeff] Let's go. Let's go.
[nurse 1] We've got to get that tube out, okay?
You ready, buddy?
What's wrong, bud? You want her?
Yeah. I'mma let her stay. It's okay.
It's okay. You're all right, buddy.
Relax, okay?
[nurse 2] All right, we have a couple minutes of hubbub
before we get the tube out.
[nurse 1] Open your mouth. We're just gonna clean your mouth first.
Then we're gonna get that tube out.
[nurse 2] Relax. Let me just take off some tape. Perfect.
[nurse 1] Slow breaths. [nurse 2] We have a cuff link.
Here we go, bud. Ready?
One, two, three. Take a big breath.
Big breath, big breath. Big breath.
-Take a big breath. -[gags]
Okay. Relax, relax.
Slow breaths. She's just gonna suction your mouth again.
Slow breaths, bud.
Good job. Can you say "Hi"?
[weakly] Hi.
Okay, good job, good job.
[nurse 2] We're gonna put this mask on.
[nurse 1] Put that on. Relax.
All right. You can talk to him,
but he can't answer you, okay?
-[Erin] Okay. -Yes and no.
Okay? All right, buddy.
-Great job, great job. -[nurse 2] Good to go, kid.
-[muffled] Hey, E. -Mmm?
You're sittin' on my leg.
[laughs] Oh.
-Hi. -[Erin] Hi.
No talking. No talking.
I'm a tough guy.
[softly] No talking.
I know you're tough.
Is he in there tellin' 'em about the bomber?
Yeah, I think so.
Fuckin' miracle. My boy. Fuckin' hero.
You bet.
[Jeff] Sort of the same kind of build,
but, like, maybe a little taller.
[stammers] But I looked him right in the eyes,
so he's the same...
Was he young or old?
Young. He was young.
Yeah.
[Morell] What do you remember after the blast?
[Jeff] Uh...
There was, like, this smell.
Like, it smelled like...
-[Morell] Take your time. -[breathes deeply]
Like the Fourth of July.
[Jake Tapper on TV] Is now, in fact, we know, dead.
All right, Dr Schoenfeld, thank you so much for joining us.
We really appreciate it.
Obviously, Dr Schoenfeld, limited by what he can say
because of the situation, obviously,
this huge manhunt being watched worldwide.
An individual, Suspect Number 1,
uh, now dead, we know.
-[gasps] -Fuckin' A!
-Oh, my God! -You son of a bitch!
[Uncle Bob] Fuckin' kill that other son of a bitch, too!
Jeffrey, I just met Carlos.
He's the guy who saved your life.
[Kevin] Would you like a coffee?
I brought some... I've got some... Got some coffees.
Don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I think everyone in that hospital is thinking that same thing.
Yeah.
We broke up about a month ago, me and Jeff.
It's not the first time... We usually get back together.
Not this time?
Doesn't show up for anything.
He's always late.
You know, he... He never wants to leave his apartment.
I'm just fed up with it.
And then he shows up.
[man on TV] Sounded like multiple assault rifle shots to me.
[female reporter] 8:15 p.m. a person is cornered
on a boat in a yard in Watertown.
[officer on radio] A suspect in the boat.
[female reporter] Hundreds of law enforcement...
-Hi. -[Jeff] Hi.
[Dr. Kalish] Jeff, how you doin'?
-[draws curtain] -So, Jeff, we have to do
the first dressing change today.
Okay, we're gonna take these bandages off.
[Erin] I'm not looking.
[Dr. Kalish] Things get too rough, please let us know
and we can figure out how to help you.
[Marion] I'm sorry.
[Dr. Kalish] And did you already pre-medicate him
-for the dressing change? -[Marion] Yep.
He's already gotten his oxy and his dilaudid PO.
He has a PR in fentanyl for breakthrough.
And I have plenty in my pocket.
[Dr. Kalish] Now some people like to look.
Some people don't like to look at all.
No. I don't wanna look at me now.
[Dr. Kalish] So, Marion, if you can hold up the right leg...
-[Marion] Okay. -...that would be very helpful,
and we'll unwrap 'em now.
[Marion] All righty. I'm gonna just lift ya up.
-[winces] -You're gonna feel my hands.
I'm sorry, hon.
[Dr. Kalish] So I'm just taking the tape off,
and I'm gonna unwrap the Ace bandage first.
This shouldn't be too bad.
But if you have any sharp pains or anything,
please let me know.
[Marion] All right, you're gonna feel my hands.
Tell me if you're ready. Did that kick in yet?
-Doing okay? -Yeah, yeah.
-[Marion] All right. -[wincing]
Almost done with the gauze.
[groans] Fuck.
[Dr. Kalish] You okay?
Yeah.
[Dr. Kalish] You let us know if you need a break, okay?
[whispers] You're okay.
Don't look at 'em.
I'm not lookin' at 'em.
[Dr. Kalish] Okay, now this might be a little sticky.
-Looking at you. -God!
[Dr. Kalish] Doin' great. Doin' great.
[Marion] You're doin' awesome.
Okay, the dressing's off. We'll give you a minute.
-Nice little breaths. -Good job.
[Marion] In your nose, out your mouth.
[Dr. Kalish] You're doing so great.
That was the worst.
Getting the dressings off is the worst.
[Marion] Want a little more fentanyl?
Okay.
[Dr. Kalish] 'Cause now we're gonna take off the dressing on the left side, okay?
Yeah.
[Dr. Kalish] You mind going over there, Marion?
[Marion] We're just gonna set up. We're not touching anything yet.
We're just settin' up.
Just gonna shimmy this down a little.
Okay.
[Marion] All right, I'm gonna lift up, one, two, three.
You're gonna feel this again.
Pretty much just like the other one.
-[Dr. Kalish] Same thing... -[groans]
-[Marion] Sorry, hon. -[whispers] Okay.
[Marion] Do you want... I have the fentanyl in my pocket.
Do you want me to give you that?
Yeah, yeah. Let's give that to him.
[Dr. Kalish] All right, we're gonna take a break.
We'll give you some more medicine.
[Marion] Okay, let me just get to...
I'm just gonna work around you,
so I'm just gonna get to my IV.
We're almost done.
[Dr. Kalish] Now, same thing, dried blood, big pull.
-One, two, three. -[Marion] One, two, three.
-[screaming] -[Marion] That's it, that's it.
-Right here. -[retches]
Hey.
Hey.
Was I asleep?
Yeah.
A good two hours.
You need a haircut.
-No shit. -Mmm-hmm.
You need to wash it.
-No. -Yes.
-No. -Yes.
Still smells like...
You should have seen the sign I made for ya.
What'd it say?
Had, like, 3D letters and everything.
-[sniffles] -Hey.
[sobbing] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Don't say that.
-[sniffling] I'm so sorry. -Hey.
Don't say that.
You don't owe me anything.
[Uncle Bob] Yes! Yes!
What's that?
I don't know.
Maybe they caught the other guy.
[nurse] Bye, Jeff. We're so proud of you.
[Anderson Cooper on TV] Hours ago now seems to be finally over.
The last suspect being searched for, police...
According to Boston Police Department...
[Patty] It's nice they turned out for ya.
I think... I think he wants to do it himself.
[Uncle Bob] Yeah, okay.
[Patty] I'm gonna lock you off, honey. I'll lock you off.
Hold on. Okay.
You just let me know if you wanna--
Thanks, Kevin. Thanks.
[female reporter 1] Take a picture with Erin for us.
[female reporter 2] Does it feel good to be going home?
[female reporter 3] Is Carlos Arrendondo your guardian angel?
[Uncle Bob] They hated each other,
and that's why Pete got busted for it.
'Cause Bob was using his computer.
And Pete didn't rat him out.
And he... He almost had to go to jail for that.
It was in the papers and all that.
-Hey, listen, look at this. -[Patty] Hey.
-[Patty laughs] -Ain't that somethin'?
[Patty] Oh, my... [Uncle Bob] Both sides.
"Boston Strong."
-Let... We've got to wave. -[car honking]
-[Jeff] What does that even mean? -Wave.
[Uncle Bob] You're a national fuckin' hero, kiddo.
[Patty] You wave, Jeff.
They're all out for ya.
You're a real hero.
[Uncle Bob] Isn't that somethin'?
And it's just the start.
[Uncle Bob] That's really somethin'.
[Jeff] I'm a hero for standin' there and getting my legs blown off?
[Big Jeff] What are ya talkin' about?
That's the HOV for electric vehicles and whatnot.
No, like, for, uh... It's just for handicap cars.
No, no, there's no handicap drivin' lane.
Jesus, what a bunch of morons.
[Aunt Jenn] Okay, we're fuckin' morons,
'cause we care about people with disabilities?
[Aunt Karen] Ooh, ooh, Jeff, Jeff! He's here.
[Aunt Jenn] Fuck you.
-All right, let's do this. -Yes!
Come on. Look out.
Hey.
[Big Jeff] I got this back there.
[Aunt Jenn] Oh, shit, don't pull it.
[Big Jeff] Okay, got it, buddy?
[Patty] Got the back? Whoo-hoo-hoo!
[Big Jeff] Patty, I still think Jeffie could live with me.
[Patty] Oh, yeah, all the way up there in Cow Hampshire.
All his friends are here, ya idiot.
[Uncle Bob] All due respect, I got more room than all of yous.
And I'm the only one with a credit score above 520.
[Aunt Jenn] I'm the one got a pool.
[Uncle Bob] Above fucking ground!
[Uncle Bob] Oh, careful, careful.
Oh, ow, ow.
[Patty] For God's sakes!
[Uncle Bob grunts] Jesus! My shin splints.

We're all gonna end up in a fuckin' wheelchair.
[Big Jeff] Not a tingle in your leg...
He's home! That's all that matters.
-God, I got a lot to do and-- -So psyched.

-This stuff... -It's, uh, every day.

Ya know, you're Boston Strong, right?
-Huh? -We're proud of you, Jeff.

You can just hand me your clothes.

[Uncle Bob] I don't need a doctor.
[Aunt Jenn] Oh, shut the fuck up, Bob.
[Patty] What time is it?
[Aunt Jenn] You know what time it is, and we have to be going.
vvng on door]

-Jeffrey, good morning. -[sighs]
Jeffrey, are you awake?

-Come on. -[sighs]
No, I'm up. No, I'm up, Ma.
Oh. Okay. All right. I think he's...

This is what I'm wearing.
[Aunt Jenn] What the hell was that?
[Patty] Fuck.
-[groaning] -[Patty] Jeffrey?
Sweetie, Jeffrey, are you okay?
-I hear it. -Shh!
Jeffrey! Just tell me you're okay, baby.
-I don't know what he's doing. -[Jeff moaning]
What do you think is going on?
Jesus, Patty, what do you think boys do in their room
-when they lock their door? -[gasps]
-Yeah, I think he's doin' it. -You think he--
The kid's got no legs, and he's blowin' loads.
-[Jeff groaning] -[Aunt Jenn] Dirty fucking...
[Patty] Jeffrey?
[Patty] It's gonna be very special, Jeffie.
Everybody wants to see ya.
See how good you're doin'.
I just wish you would have let somebody cut your freakin' hair.
[Aunt Jenn] Oh, stop pickin' on him.
-[reporters clamouring] -It's gonna be good.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi. He's doin' good.
He has an appointment. So...
[Aunt Jenn] I'm his Aunt Jenn. I'm here for support.
[female reporter on TV] After the bomb blast
at the Boston Marathon took most of his legs,
28-year-old Chelmsford resident Jeff Bauman is lucky to be alive,
but his real struggle has just begun.
Bauman told reporters that he will one day walk again.
After multiple surgeries and endless painful rehabilitation,
many people would give up.
[woman] Erin, come here! [female reporter] But with the support
-of his family and friends... -Jeff's on TV!
-My Jeff? -Come here.
[female reporter] ...supporters all over the world.
Jeff Bauman has found something amazing here at Spaulding Hospital.
That something is called hope.
In the days following the Marathon bombing,
this photograph showed the carnage at the finish line.
Jeff Bauman was standing next to one of the bombs
when it detonated, obliterating his legs.
A day later, from his hospital bed, Bauman scribbled a note.
"I know what happened."
He's a real hero, my son.
He's helpin' this city heal.
Be Boston Strong.
[female reporter] Is that true, Jeff?
Are you Boston Strong?
[Patty] You did real good today, kiddo.
That kind of exposure, you know,
that could lead to opportunities.
Make things, you know,
easier for ya...
-Yeah. -...down the lane.
You got a call from Carlos.
He wants to visit with ya.
And we should be thankful for him.
[Patty] In here. Hey.
Sir, how you doin'?
-Hi. How are you? -Paul Martino.
-How are you, Paul? -Nice to meet you.
Uh, casts shouldn't take more than...
-hour, hour and a half. -Okay.
Cast is a very quick procedure,
but it's the most important part.
If we get a good impression of you,
then the rest of the procedure is gonna go nicely.
-You okay? -Yeah.
We're gonna start on this side, okay?
We're gonna slip a sock on you here.
It's just a cotton stocking that...
This is so that when we wrap the plaster on you,
it doesn't stick directly to your skin.
[Greig Martino] Did you hear the one
where the farmer was paintin' his bathroom?
Figured he'd shellac the toilet seat, make it look prettier.
He didn't tell his wife.
Daughter says, "What's the matter, Dad?
"Ain't you ever seen one of these before?"
He says, "Yeah, I just never saw anybody frame it."
[Greig] Sorry, sorry. Sorry, Jeff.
[Patty] Don't make him laugh too hard.
[Paul] Allow this to get hard.
And then we're gonna make a slice in it.
We're gonna take it right off you, okay?
Maybe you could, uh, use your new legs
for next week at the Bruins game, huh?
[Jeff] Ma, that's, like, in a week.
-Yep. -[Paul] Give me a couple of weeks
of fabrication and delivery.
[Patty] Get out of here.
[Paul] Couple of weeks, Jeff, you'll be up.
[Patty] I can't wait.
[Paul] We can get you up any time.
We're gonna clean up this side
and then we'll go on and do the right.
We'll be just as quick, and--
[Patty] I wanna have it signed.
-[Paul] Less pain. Okay... -Yeah, yeah.
...but at least you know what to expect.
Right.
[Patty] They've asked him to go out
on the ice and wave the flag.
[commentator] Jonny Gomes coming to the plate here
-for the Red Sox. -[clapping] Let's go, Jonny!
Get us a fuckin' hit.
[commentator] Be one-to-one now.
Don't swing at that shit. Let that shit go.
[commentator] Gomes with a special bat in hand,
to remember the victims
-of the Marathon... -[Patty] Hey, Jeff!
You hear that? His bat says "Boston Strong."
[Uncle Bob] Hey, leave him be. He's snappin' a deuce.
-[Sully] No, no, no, no, no! -[grunts]
[Uncle Bob] God damn it.
[Patty] Not too good, huh?
[Uncle Bob] No, he fouled up.
After everything we've been through?
Haven't we suffered enough?
Hey, so is he gonna do it?
[Patty] Oh, I don't know. He's nervous.
He's nervous about what?
[Sully] Jeff, we heard about the Bruins game!
Sounds pretty cool, bro.
[Patty] They're gonna give us box seats.
[Big D] Wait, "us"?
[Patty] Said we could bring the whole crew.
-Yo, you've got to do this, Jeff! -Free drinks!
[Sully] The Bruins need ya!
[Big D] Don't be a pussy, bro!
Shit. Ow!
[Big D] What kind of food they got?
[Uncle Bob] All-you-can-eat.
[Sully] It's all-you-can-eat, Jeff. Come on, man.
-[groaning] -Stop being selfish about this shit.
-[cell phone ringing] -[Erin] Is that my phone?
[Erin] Hello?
-[Jill] Smells delicious, Ma. -Thank you.
-Dad, I'm gonna sit with you. -Sure.
[Jeff] E-Money. What're you doin'?
Uh, talkin' to you. What are you doin'?
Dancin'.
Hey, let me just step out of the club.
-What? -Can you hear me now?
Yeah, I can hear you.
How you doin'?
Yeah, you know.
[stammers] Hey, so I hope...
I hope... I hope I didn't get ya at a bad time,
but I, uh... You know, it's the, uh,
Bruins playoff game against Chicago next week,
and they asked me to come out there on the ice.
[chuckles] On the ice?
Yeah, I'm not, like, on the... Not to play,
but, y'know, to be the banner captain
and, like, wave the flag and shit.
It's kind of like singin' the national anthem,
but for people who suck at singing.
You sure you wanna do that?
Well, everybody says I should. It's the Stanley Cup, so...
Listen, Erin, I... I know we're not together, but...
I was just, um...
I was wondering if maybe you wanted
to come with me and my family.
I don't think that I could do it without you.
And I know that it's not really fair of me to say.
I'm really... I'm sorry, um...
But I...
[voice quivering] I really need you right now.
And, uh, please.
Okay. Yeah.
[announcer on PA] During tonight's warm-up,
we would like to invite you to purchase
raffle tickets for the Boston Bruins...
[Aunt Jenn] Hey, they had that Carlos "cowboy hat" guy
all over the news last night.
Jeff, he told the story, and I was fuckin' bawlin'.
-[Big Jeff] You all right? -Yeah--
Gonna squeeze through and get out of your way...
-Mom's way here. -[Uncle Bob] Oh, thank you.
Let's go, Boston!
[Aunt Karen] All right!
[Uncle Bob] Okay, a toast, a toast!
You cool?
Yeah, I'm good.
[Uncle Bob] Know why they call Chicago the windy city?
'Cause you guys blow!
-Do you have a smoke? -Oh, oh.
Jeff, we'd like to, uh, stage you sooner.
-Oh, yeah. -If that's all right.
-Yeah, yeah. -Okay.
-Okay. -All right.
-Let's do this! -[Patty] They're goin' now!
[announcer] And now...
[woman] Ooh, big crowd out there.
Completely full tonight.
[Erin] Hey, don't be nervous.
[woman] How are you doin', Jeff?
-Yeah, I'm great. -[woman] You okay?
Just stop here.
-I'm gonna get the flag. -Yeah.
Here's the flag, Jeff.
I'm gonna be standin' right over there,
and then I'm gonna signal you when to come out, okay?
-All right? Have fun. -[loud rock music plays]
Have fun, okay? Get pumped.
[Jeff] Uh...
I don't think I can do this, E.
[Erin] Jeff, look, it's gonna be okay.
You just wave the flag. And then you leave. Right?
[woman] Okay, Jeff, that's your cue. Get out there.
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to TD Garden and game two of the NHL play-offs.
Please give a warm Boston welcome
to tonight's honorary fan banner captain,
-Jeff Bauman! -[cheering]
Jeff's continued strength and perseverance
in the face of adversity represents all that is
Boston Strong!
-[cheering] -[air horn blowing]
Go, Jeffrey!
Whoo!
[Erin] I'm gonna get you out of here.
Get away from me. Get the fuck away from me.
-Jeff-- -Get away from me.
Get away from me!
You stay calm.
You stay calm. You help somebody else.
Babe.
-Hey. What-- -Get away from me!
-Jeff! -Get the fuck away from me.
Go help somebody else!
Go help somebody else!
You stay calm!
You stay calm!
You stay calm and go help somebody else.
[Jeff] I'm sorry.
You need to tell your family what's going on with you.
No, no.
Believe me, it's better if they don't know. Trust me.
They keep trying to make a hero out of me.
[Erin] Does it hurt?
No.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
[Erin] I'm here, Jeff. I'm here.
I'm here.
Did you have sex with my son?
Yeah.
[Jeff] Don't you think...
Shouldn't you be leanin' on me?
Hmm?
I wish you were leanin' on me.
I'm just happy to be sitting here with you.
[Patty] They are so futuristic, aren't they, Jeffrey?
[Grieg] What you have is a Genium knee.
Genium is a microprocessing,
top-of-the-line, high-tech knee.
Two carbon fibre sockets with suction suspension.
Deep breath as you go up.
[Jeff] And, like, you know, you've just got to work, like,
you know, your core strength and everything,
and then you've got to stand up on 'em
and get your balance right.
But they're, like... They have...
They're like feet. They are like feet and legs.
And, like, they're attached to shoes.
[Erin] Mmm-hmm.
And you can just, like...
Are they cool?
I'm gonna walk.
You know, I'm gonna walk with you again someday.
-Read them at the same time. -Go.
See if they link up.
-"Determination is... -"Don't be hasty.
-"...the wake-up call... -"Prosperity will knock...
-"...to the human will." -"...on your door soon."
I didn't hear yours.
No, I didn't hear yours either.
-Okay. -[laughing]
-[Jeff] I'm gonna get it. -All right, keep going.
-[Erin] I'm not gonna help you. -[crunching]
You have to eat them to be real?
That's, like, a super-loud... You have a super-loud crunch.
Arms up. Get those arms up.
[Jeff] Do you wanna, I don't know, like, come live with me or somethin'?
You serious?
[Jeff] Mmm-hmm.
You have to tell Patty.
Yeah, I'll tell Patty today.
Okay.
She's so hungover. She won't even remember, all right?
[laughing] She won't remember.
We'll be living there for two weeks.
We've got to fuckin' celebrate.
[woman] Boston Strong!
Jeff.
Boston Strong!
[Big Jeff] Jesus Christ. Oh, God.
[Uncle Bob] Can you believe this shit?
We needed a win, Bob. We needed a win.
How we supposed to not take this personally?
[Big D] Hey, you got a leaf in your drink.
[Kevin] It's a mint leaf.
-A mint, huh? -It's a mojito.
You muddle the lime and the mint.
You add sugar and ice,
and you pour over rum, soda water.
You "muddle" it?
[Kevin] Yes, you muddle the lime and the mint,
and then you add the sugar and ice.
[Aunt Jenn] Hey, when we gonna hear this big announcement?
[Aunt Karen] Yes, just tell us already. [Patty] Oh, when the game's over.
-Hey. -Hey.
Hey, so, Dale, I need two burgers ready.
Um, you take that down. That would be helpful.
Chips, too, if you don't mind.
Holy shit, you can taste the mint, bro. Try that.
[Kevin] I'm happy to make you guys one.
[Big D] Yeah, that'd be great, yeah, sure.
[Erin] So nice, you having everybody over.
-Three? -Hey, anybody that knows me
knows I don't do nothin' half-arsed.
Except high school.
Go fuck yourself, Bob.
[Aunt Karen] Hey, Erin, how are things at work?
You still at Brigham and Women's?
No, no, I, um... I actually gave them my notice.
-[gasps] Ya get fired? -No, no...
What's... What's his guy's name?
[Erin] We're just taking some time, Jeff and I...
-I'm gonna be there... -That's wonderful, honey.
...through the therapy and everything.
-Yeah. -I'm moving in, actually.
-Huh. -So, just to be around, you know?
Wait, what?
[Erin] Jeff told you.
You knew that.
No.
[Erin] Jeff, you didn't tell your mom?
-Huh? -[Erin] Jeff?
You didn't tell your mom I was moving in?
I... I thought that's what today was for.
Like, you know, uh, announcements and shit.
Very small apartment for three people, Jeffrey.
Yeah, but technically it's only like two and a half.
That ain't funny.
That ain't funny.
Oh, Patty, did you give everyone the big news?
[Aunt Karen] What? You told him, and you didn't tell us?
She didn't tell me shit.
I just knew there was gonna be a big announcement.
-Yeah, what's goin' on? -So, spill it already. Christ!
All right, all right, all right, okay. This is it.
-Come on, get me up. -Patty.
Get me up.
Okay, listen up, this is how it's gonna be.
Fasten your seat belts.
Oprah's comin'.
-[shrieks] -Oh, my God!
Shut up!
Oprah called me!
She is flyin' down to interview Jeffrey.
-Day after tomorrow. -Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
You're gonna meet Stedman!
-Hey, man. -No, no, no.
[Uncle Bob] Oprah's fat ass... [Aunt Jenn] Gayle! Oprah!
She's comin' to...
-Patty. Patty. -What?
Jeff's not doing that stuff any more.
What do you mean? Fuck.
-Fuck off. -Uh-huh.
-He's not. -Come on, it's Oprah.
He's not doing interviews. He's not doin'...
-[Patty] Jeffrey? -...public appearances.
-None of that. -[Patty] Jeffrey, talk to me.
It's too much.
-[coughs] Jeffie. -It's not good for him.
-It's too much, because-- -Yeah, 'course he is.
-It's fuckin' Oprah Winfrey. -[Erin] He doesn't want--
[Patty] She's the most famous person in the world.
[Erin] Patty, all those people looking at him, asking him questions
-and needing something. -Yeah, butt out.
Come on, Jeffrey, talk to me.
[Erin] It's a lot of pressure.
And somebody's always tryin' to take something from him. It's too much.
You gonna let her do this, or you gonna tell me for yourself?
-It's too much, Patty. -I wanna hear from you.
[Erin] I'm speaking for him.
You're not so drunk ya can't speak to me.
-[Erin] If you would listen to me-- -No, you don't speak for my son.
[Jeff] Why'd you... Why didn't you tell me sooner?
-What? -Why didn't you tell me sooner?
Because... Why do you think? I wanted to make it a surprise.
I wanted a big announcement. You know?
-It's Oprah Winfrey. -I'm sorry, Ma.
[Patty] Where would I have been without Oprah?
She got me through the bad times.
And I don't know where, what I would be.
I would've... I would've hung myself in the bathroom without Oprah.
Just sayin'.
Just sayin'.
So, hey, if Oprah's your lifeline,
you got a lot deeper issues, Patty.
-I'm just sayin'. -Fuck you, Bob.
Shut up, Bob.
I just wanted people to see how amazing my son is.
That's all.
What's so bad about that?
Aw, E, come on.
[laughing] sorry.
-E, come on, push it. -I am.
There ya go.
I got it.
-Hey. -Oh, hey.
Oh, how you doin'?
Um, really well. How are you?
Sully bought me a fuckin' sombrero.
-I'm... -He did?
-Yeah. -This is from him?
Yeah, he said he was out
at a Mexican restaurant last night, so...
They got super hammered and brought back two sombreros,
and I got one of 'em.
-[Erin] Lucky. -[sighs]
-One... -Two, three!
-[guitar clangs] -[groans]
-[Erin] Oh, fuck. -Fuck.
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?
[Erin] I'm sorry.

This is from Denver, Colorado.
[slurring] "You... I have never seen a stronger,
"more brilliant person in my life."
[Jeff] Go to sleep, Ma.
"Thank you so much."
She's talkin' about you, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey?
She's talkin' about my son.
Hey, Jeffrey, we should go... We should go to Colorado.
-We should go to Denver. -Ma.
And go see those nice people.

Just you and me, huh?
-[knock on door] -Go to fuckin' sleep, Ma!
[chuckles] Oh, all right.
[blows] Bye.
[Jeff] I don't wanna hear any more of those letters.
Don't forget about the Red Sox.
Want you to throw out the first pitch.
Look, I've got to tap out, boys.
I have rehab in the morning.
I don't want the lady gettin' pissed.
-Want some pills? -You fuckin' retarded, Sully?
I just told you, I've got to get home.
-What are they? -Not sure.
Found 'em on my sister's dresser.
You're either gonna get high as fuck,
or they're gonna regulate our periods.
-Pretty sure. -[laughing]
Excuse me. Are you Jeff Bauman?
We have been following your story ever since we saw that photo.
[woman] Then we saw you at the Bruins game, wavin' the flag.
It's so good to see you're healed
and that you didn't let them win.
-Can we take a picture? -Yeah, sure.
-Okay. -Who didn't I let win?
[man] The terrorists.
Can we... Yeah, let's get a picture with him.
Oh, right, yeah.
-Are you sure about that? -Yeah.
'Cause, I mean, like,

you know, looks like they at least got on the scoreboard.
You know, I'm never gonna walk again.

All right. One more, one more, one more.
You don't get this picture, I'm gonna fucking kill myself.
-Just one more. -[all laughing]

It was so nice to meet you.
[Big D] Keep your stumps together, though.
No. Come on, give me some speed!
Oh, watch it, I'll get him.

[Sully] Excuse me. Excuse me!
That was a six. That's a generous six.
At most.
He didn't stick the fucking landing, bro.
-[Big D] Oh! -[laughter]
[Sully] Ouch.
A tour of their facility.
But I'm gonna get a... Should get a medal.
I'm your fuckin' hero.
Why, thank you.
You're welcome.
For finding the fucking bombers, you piece of shit.
I should not be operating machinery tonight.
Hey! Hey! Easy!
[Big D] Shit, Sull. Ah!
Sull, didn't you get your licence yanked for driving drunk?
Didn't you blow, like, a .08?
Better than who you blew last week.
Hey! Hey. Sull, no, you'll go to jail.
I'm just trying to get you home
before your fuckin' wife kills us.
No, she's not my wife! Give me the keys.
Do you still even got a licence?
No, they don't lose... You don't lose your licence
when you fuckin' lose your legs. Dumb ass.
How you gonna reach the pedals?
Fuckin' get down there. You gonna push 'em for me.
Is that even safe?
[Jeff] No.
Okay.

Hey, wait a minute.
You Jeff Bauman?
Yeah, yeah.
[officer] What?
-Yeah. -You are?
Yeah.
Can I get a picture with you?
[woman 1 on TV] You, um, put the sauce in too early,
it falls right to the bottom of the cake.
[woman 2] Look at that. So soft.
[woman 1] And if you put it in too late,
it sits right at the top edge.
[woman 2] Oh, I love that. That's a fun fact.
You take your pill?
-Did you take your medication? -No.
Jeff?
-No. -Hello? What?
-No. -No?
Could you take it, please?
Please, please, please?
Please? Pause it.
-Pause? -No, keep going.
Hey, wasn't Patty supposed to take you to rehab?
Pill packer.
[Erin] Wanna go in front of all those people
with the noise and the lights?
[Jeff] You'll be there.
[Patty] You don't even have to be there, Erin, you know?
Jeff is goin' out on the field with the Carlos guy.
It's why he's eatin' lunch with him next week.
[sighs] My God.
He's gonna get to know him.
People think of them as a team.
No, you think of us as a team, Ma.
No, the whole fuckin' world thinks of you as a team.
-It's not just me. -It's just weird.
-I don't wanna meet him. I told you. -[coughs]
-Oh, Jesus, Jeff. -[Michele] Hey, guys.
[Patty] God's sake, I made the fuckin' reservation.
[Jeff] I don't wanna meet Carlos.
I don't wanna relive the worst day of my life.
[Michele] We really have to be on time for these appointments. Okay?
[Erin] We got stuck in traffic.
[Patty] Yeah, she forgot the sleeves.
She forgot the sleeves.
[Michele] You okay?
Let's get about a 30-second count there, okay?
Just add a little more strengthening to it, okay?
So let's start off with the right arm,
left leg for a count of...
One, two, three, four...
Remember, concentrate here on the glutes.
Don't arch your back.
This is the first time you're in this week,
and you have three appointments.
Okay?
You've got to get in here as many times as you can
-for your appointments... -I know.
I keep tellin' 'em, y'know?
Or it's not gonna work, okay?
You have to keep your appointments,
and you have to come in ready to work.
I mean, look at everybody around here, Jeff.
They're recovering because they put the time
and the energy into it.
And they make it a priority. And you have to do that, too.
[cashier] Did you find everything?
Yeah.
Do you have a bathroom?
We do. It's right over in the corner.
Jeff?
Jeff?
Jeff.
Jeff.
-Wake up. -[mumbles indistinctly]
Wake up.
You and Patty get hammered?
Wake up.
-Blanket? -[Erin] Mmm-hmm.
[Erin] You want the board? [Jeff] Yeah.
Can I have my Gatorade?
I got it.
[Patty] Yeah, he'll be helpin' the Red Sox.
It's his favourite team since he was a little boy.
[Erin] Jeff's throwin' out the first pitch
isn't gonna help 'em win, Patty.
Bruins lost that game that we went to.
Whoa!
Thought we said we weren't gonna say that out loud.
[Patty] You see, the fact you say that, Erin,
shows how little you know about baseball.
Are you... Are you even from here?
[Patty] Smart. [Michele] Okay.
[Patty] Huh? What?
[Michele] How they feel? Good? [Jeff] Yeah.
[Michele] All set?
All right, when you're ready,
you're gonna scooch ahead before you stand up.
[Jeff] Okay, let me just straighten that leg there.
[Michele] Mmm-hmm.
-Yup. -[Michele] Okay.
Okay, scooch ahead.
Okay, got it. I'm gonna get it.
Up. Hips back, hips back. Chest up.
-Chest up. -[Patty] Jeffie. You're up!
[Michele] Chest up, okay? Chest up.
-My God! -[Michele] Chest up. Chest up.
Good, good. Okay? Good.
[Patty] That's amazing. Wow.
[Michele] You okay?
God, you are so tall.
-[laughs] -[Michele] All right? Okay.
[Jeff groans] It's a little sore there.
Oh, my God.
[Michele] Okay.
Nah, it's like needles in my legs.
[Michele] Okay. [Patty] Yeah,
-but you look awesome. -[Jeff groans]
[Erin] Good job, Jeff.
[Patty] Oh, you're amazing, Jeffie. Looks amazing.
[Michele] It's the first time.
[Patty] Keep goin'. Keep goin'.
-I can't. I can't. -[Michele] Good job.
[Erin] Let him sit. [Jeff] I've got to sit down.
[Michele] Okay, yup. Okay.
[Michele] Good job. Good job.
[Patty] Wheels, before... It's gonna make it easier for ya.
-Ya lock the wheels first. -[Erin] Yeah, I just... I did.
[Jeff] E. [Patty] And then ya pull up the seat.
[Jeff yells] Hey, E, can you get my Gatorade?
I don't have it.
-[Patty] Ya didn't lock... -Fuckin'...
...the wheels, 'cause if you did, it wouldn't be movin'.
-No, you still haven't done it! -[Erin] Would you back off?
-Oh... -Patty!
[Patty] What?
[Erin] Jesus Christ, I'm sick of this shit.
-I'm sick of both of you. -[Jeff] What?
E, what the fuck? Calm down.
I'm tired of you fuckin' talkin' to me like I'm an idiot.
[Patty] A child is what you are.
[Erin] Okay? I am not an idiot, Patty.
-Every time you open your... -Ma, cut it out.
This is behaviour I've come to know and love.
Do you understand me? Really, I can't--
[Patty] I'm just callin' it like it is.
-[Erin] I'm tired, Jeff, okay? -Everybody's tired!
[Erin] This didn't just happen to you.
What do you mean, it didn't just happen to me?
It did just happen to me!
Could you just open your eyes for one fucking second,
and acknowledge the huge circle...
Look at me! Look at me!
Jeff, the huge circle of people
that have fucking altered their lives
to orbit around you. Okay?
You have no fucking idea how much--
You act like this is fucking easy for him!
[Erin] When do I act like this is easy?
Last night, he's fucking wasted
-and covered in his own shit. -[Jeff] Hey...
And I have to clean him up.
And nobody else is there helping me.
[Patty scoffs] Oh, it's my fault?
[Erin] I have to carry him to the bed.
Can you not fucking say that right now?
[Erin] What? [Jeff] Can you not talk
-about that right now? -People are watching!
I don't give a fuck. I don't give a shit.
Well, maybe they don't teach you manners in Amesbury, huh?
You say one more fucking thing about Amesbury, Patty,
I'll punch you in the fucking face. Do you understand that?
-Don't you... Don't you threaten me. -Get in the car!
Go. Get in the car.
[Patty] You gonna let her talk to me this way?
Yeah, just fuckin' walk away. You're not on the team.
[Gail sighs] So you wanna tell me what's goin' on?
Uh, stress, lack of sleep,
uh, minor surgeries, fittings for his legs.
Okay. [chuckles]
Physical therapy sessions.
His mom yelling at me
for every fuckin' thing I have ever done.
I knew this was gonna happen.
This is what you do, you just... You take on too much.
You take on other people's problems
and you forget yourself.
Uh, what the fuck is this?
Did... Please tell me you found this in a dumpster
and you're playing some prank on me.
I'm just kidding. Okay. Uh... Fuck.
Um, how long?
Five weeks.
Does he know?
No.
I'm tellin' him tonight.
-[music playing] -[indistinct chatter]
[Jeff] Here we go.
[Big D] Yeah, so I saw...
Saw him on the news again yesterday.
[Sully] That's good rotation on that.
It's like a shish kebab.
[Jeff] Burn that shit.
[Big D] Oh, yeah, light that up.
Give him that... That goddamn cowboy hat.
It's a whole event, that hat.
[Sully] He really wear that thing in real life?
You still talkin' about that Mexican guy?
[scoffs] Costa Rican. Jesus, Bob.
-Welcome to 1965, buddy. -You know what I meant.
-[Jeff laughs] -For God's sakes.
I tell ya what, I'd really like to meet that guy.
Costa Rican, Mexican, Honduran, whatever he is.
I don't care.
Why?
He's a fuckin' American hero, Jeffie.
Not for him, you wouldn't be sittin' here
-drinkin' beers on my tab. -Fuck that guy.
Come to think of it, maybe he ought to pay.
Hey, Jeffie, wasn't I supposed to take you
to pick up your girl, like, 10 minutes ago?
Hey, you want... Who wants another round?
I'll have one. Who's paying?
-Who you think? -[Big D] Not you.
Uncle Bob.
Hey, can I just get the check?
[waitress] What's up?
-Can I just get the check? -[waitress] Oh, sure.
Yeah, four... Four mai tais.
[man 1] Give me an order of fried rice
and some, uh, chicken wings.
Yeah, yeah.
[man 2] I don't know. I like pizza, too.
Don't forget my order.
Hey, you're the guy. From the wheelchair.
One in the picture with the guy in the fuckin' cowboy hat?
Yeah.
-Yeah. -Hey, that's awesome.
[man 2] Hey, you know what?
Me and this fuckin' handsome guy,
we work, like, 10 blocks away
from where the bombin' happened.
-Yeah. -It's fuckin' crazy, right?
Yeah, like, right there.
[man 2] We were right there. [man 1] Right there.
[man 2] We saw the whole fuckin' thing.
-Hey, you know what, though? -No shit.
Let me ask you. That whole thing, it was a conspiracy, right?
Mai tais?
[man 2] The whole thing was a hoax.
[man 1] Yeah.
[man 2] It was like a fuckin' false flag.
It was like it didn't happen. It was all, like, bullshit.
Fuckin' so Obama could send us to war with Iran.
We're not gonna tell anybody.
-What? -[man 2] You...
You got paid to do the bombing.
Fuckin' Obama did this whole thing
so we'd go to a war with Iran, bro.
[man 3] What the fuck are you talking about?
-[man 1] He's got a point. -Hey, you know what?
We're already at war with Iran, you fuckin' douche bag.
Oh, yeah?
-[man 3] Ooh. -Fuckin' douche bag?
-The fuck you talkin'-- -Fuck you.
-Calm down. -Yo, this guy's fuckin' phony-baloney.
-Easy, easy... -Phony-baloney.
Fuck you!
-Hey, come on, man! -Say, take it easy.
Go fuckin' make pizza, you piece of shit.
[Jeff] Fuck you, man.
You're fuckin' nuts, buddy!
[Jeff] Come on! Somebody fuckin' hit me!
-[woman screams] -Fuckin' hit me, huh?
Fuckin' hit me!
Fuckin' hit me!
Hey, stop, stop.
[Jeff] I got your messages after,
when I was tryin' to call you.
That's such bullshit, Jeff.
You drunk? [sighs]
Not any more.
Were you ever gonna show up tonight?
Or were you just gonna leave me sitting there?
[Jeff] What is this?
-Open it. -What is it?
-Open it. -Why?
Open the letter.
[Jeff] "Someone small and wonderful is about to happen to you."
"Someone small and..."
Is this a fuckin' joke?
No, it's not a joke. Why would I joke about this?
Is this like a...
Yeah.
Like what...
[stammers] I can't do this.
Someone else you don't show up for.
Erin, you... You--
Jeff, I gave up my family for you.
And my job. I'm not giving this up, too.
This is bigger than you.
I thought you were careful.
Careful?
I can't do this. [stammers] I can't do it.
I can't raise a kid. I can't look after him.
-I can't... I can't look... -[Erin sighs]
What am I supposed to do?
I'm supposed to chase after him?
Like, I'm supposed to chase after him?
How am I gonna take care of him?
I'm gonna... I'm gonna mess him up.
Yes, you are gonna mess him up.
But not because you don't have legs.
Because you're a fucking kid still.
You let your mom push you around like a baby in a stroller.
Oh, fuck you, Erin.
You do!
Fuck you, Erin!
You just have to show up for once.
-Show up? -Yes.
-Show up? -Yes!
I fucking showed up for you! I showed up!
I was standing there for you!
-Oh, fuckin' what? -And look what it got me!
So this is my fault, then?
I showed up for you!
All of this is my fault, right?
I showed up for you!
It doesn't scare me! Just show up. That's it!
I can't! I can't! I can't! I can't do it!
Why do you even want me?
Why? I'm such a fuck-up!
Can't do it. I'm not... I can't do it. I can't.
Don't walk away from me. Erin!
Erin!
Erin!
Don't walk away from me.
Erin! Erin!
Erin!
Erin, don't walk away from... Erin!
Hey!
Mind your own fuckin' business! [sobbing]
[groans] E!
Erin!
Hey!
Open the door!
Erin!
Erin. Erin.
Erin. Erin!
Please! Please! Please!
[Jeff] Go help somebody else.
[man] Lay back, I got you. I got you.
Help somebody else!
[man] Stay calm.
Go help somebody else. I'm good.
[man] This one's critical.
We need help.
[Carlos] Hold on. Just relax.
You're going to be Okay. Help is coming.
Over here! We need a chair over here.
[sobbing] Erin...
Please, open the door.
Carlos.
Jeff.
Oh, you want one of these?
Uh... Coffee, please.
[Jeff] Want a beer, anything like that?
No. Thank you.
It's too early for me.
Not for me. [chuckles]
Well, thanks for showing up.
It's the least I could do.
So...
Yeah.
Why were you there?
At the finish line?
Yeah, I mean, you know, like, based on that hat
and my limited knowledge of aerodynamics,
-I assume it wasn't to run. -[chuckles]
No, no, I... I wasn't there to run. I...
I was there for my boys.
They were running in the...
No, no, my...
My boys are dead.
Shit.
They died years ago.
Uh...
Oh. Thank you.
Do you have kids?
[Jeff] Mmm. Uh...
[Carlos] Mmm.
Alex, uh, was my oldest.
Uh, he was a Marine,
but he got killed by a sniper in Najaf.
You know, the way I find out is,
a van pulls up in front of my house, and...
And three Marines, they get out.
But I knew.
I knew before they rang the doorbell. I knew.
And then I did something very stupid, right?
I grabbed a can of gasoline and a blowtorch,
and I ran past them and... [stammers]
And I locked myself in their van.
They tried to pull me out. The...
The blowtorch sparked, and I, um...
Those Marines,
they could have died, and they saved me.
The worst part is, I...
I had to go to my son's funeral on a stretcher.
I'm not proud of that, you know.
What about your other son?
Brian.
You remind me of Brian.
He took his own life.
It was too much for him.
You know, losing his brother, and seeing me like that.
Shit, Carlos.
I can't tell you how much
I wish I had been there for them when they needed me.
Hmm. But now I...
I travel the country, talking to soldiers.
Mostly about PTSD and depression.
I help a little.
And it keeps me going.
But the truth is,
I don't understand.
Mmm.
I was there that day at the finish line,
handing out American flags for my boys.
When the first bomb went off,
I looked up, and I saw a big ball of fire, and...
My body wanted to run.
But I thought, "This is a moment," huh?
"Make a better choice."
So I ran to the fire, and there you were.
Helping you
made me feel
like I had helped my son.
And for that, I am grateful.
You're grateful?
Yeah.
You help me as much as I help you.
And I came here to say, "Thank you."
Hmm.
Straight to voicemail, huh?
I don't blame ya.
Listen, I've been thinking, um...
You know, our... Our kid, he or she
is, uh, gonna have legs.
You're gonna be, like, a really good mom
'cause you been dealin' with a big, dumb kid already.
Sittin' here, uh,
bein' without you, it's like the worst fuckin' thing
that's ever happened to me.
By a long shot.
There was this, like... There was this time
in the hospital when, like, I...
I just wanna give up.
You know, like, where I just, like, didn't care
-if I died or not. -[Sully] Come on. Come on.
[Jeff] And now I just wanna...
[Sully] Come on, man. Come on, man.
Come on, man.
[Jeff] I just wanna walk.
You know, I just wanna stand up.
I wanna see the world from higher up, you know?
I just... I just wanna be normal.
[Big Jeff] Conference on the mound.
[Big D] You wanna just go out there and just make
a fool out of yourself in front of everybody?
[Uncle Bob] You can't do it like this.
What, I got the catcher walkin' out to the...
-[Big D] Let's go, Coach. -What?
[Big Jeff] I'm gonna put him in.
What are you talkin' about? I threw one ball, guys.
[Big D] It's your whole shoulder, your whole body--
[Uncle Bob] Aim for his balls. He's wearin' a cup.
See, that's a little... That's a little better.
Just... Now how about you throw that over the plate?
[Big D] Here we go.
[Uncle Bob] Oh, Jesus Christ! That's terrible.
Thirty-seven thousand fans are gonna be booin' your ass.
You're all messed up, all right?
-[Aunt Jenn laughs] -So listen to me.
Just listen. All right?
You're a bunch of fuckin' disasters.
[Big D] Jesus.
[Aunt Jenn] You got that right.
But I wouldn't trade ya in for anything.
So just do me a favour, all right?
Help me out?
-All right? -[Uncle Bob] Let's go. Okay.
[Big Jeff] Come on, buddy, muscle memory.
You know how to do this.
[Jeff] And now it's just about healing, getting better,
and showin' the world I'm fine and that, you know,
I'm not gonna let this hold me down, you know,
'cause then maybe if they see that,
then maybe they won't let stuff hold them down, either.
And, you know, there's always gonna be pain, I think,
you know, but, I don't know, I just
wanna, like,
live.
[announcer] The Marathon tragedy
was a man in a cowboy hat
rescuing a severely injured man.
The man in the cowboy hat had lost one son...
How you feelin', Carlos?
[Carlos] A little nervous.
Yeah.
My hands are shakin'.
My boys would have loved this.
-Hey, Carlos. -Yeah?
I'm gonna be a father.
That's wonderful.
[woman] It's time, Jeff.
-Ready? -Yeah.
[Jeff] A hero and his hero, right?
[Jackie] How are you?
-Good. -I'm Jackie.
How are you, Jackie? Jeff.
Jeff, nice to meet you.
So nice to have you here.
Nice to meet you, Carlos.
[Jackie] All right, so we're gonna walk you out
right in front of the mound and... Sound good?
-All right. -All right, let's go.
Been practising?
Yeah.
Go, Bauman!
[Gail] Your boy's on the TV.
[Lori] There he is. There he is.
Oh, wow.
Here comes the ball now.
-[Jackie laughs] -[Jeff] That's a special ball.
Hi, I'm Pedro Martinez.
[Jeff] I think I know who you are.
-[laughs] -Oh, great.
-How you doing? -I'm good.
You're very brave, you know?
We're all proud of you.
Thank you.
Here.
You've got to show me how to do a circle change-up.
-Well... -[laughs]
[Sully] Go, Bauman!
Yeah! Whoo!
All right, you got any tips?
Well, aim high.
You're gonna be all right, kid.
[Jeff] All right.
How did you get so good?
Let's go!
[Gail] He was good under pressure.
[Lori] You've got to give it to him.
All right? You've got to give it to him.
-He is under pressure. -There's a lot...
A lot of people watching that.
[commentator] Both Carlos and Jeff have gigantic smiles
from ear to ear on their faces.
What a... What a great moment.
[male spectator] See those guys coming out,
you know, everybody cheering and clapping,
actually, you know, I got goose bumps.
I got chills. So emotional.
The fans were on their feet.
Wonderful tribute by the Red Sox.
-[man 1] It was a nice pitch. -It was on the corner.
Thanks...
[Big D] Either way, I'll still buy you a beer.
-I'll still get you a beer. -No, it wasn't. It was on--
So I try and do a circle change-up.
-How you doin', man? -Did Pedro show it to you?
Way to go, Jeff. That was awesome.
[Sully] Hey, maybe we should turn around.
Thank you.
[Big D] All right, watch the shoulder. That's his throwin' arm. Careful.
I know. Careful, I've got to protect my throwin' arm.
[Big D] Got a career ahead.
Hey, don't pat the throwin' arm, man.
[Big D laughs] [Larry] Hey! Hey!
-Jeff! -Sounds like you, Sull.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, stop. Can I talk to you for a second, man?
[Jeff] What's goin' on here? [Sully] Kind of in a rush.
Just give me a second here. I just wanna talk to him for a second.
What can I help you with?
[Larry] Uh...
My, um...
My kid brother, he, uh,
was in the Marines, uh,
you know, over in the war.
And about five years ago, he got hit with an IED.
He's gone, man.
But, uh...
Sorry about that, man.
[Larry] Yeah.
You know, I saw your picture that morning.
You know, after the bomb?
All I could think about was Thomas,
just lyin' there in the dirt.
I... I get so fuckin' angry, you know?
But seein' you out there today,
throwin' that fuckin' pitch,
you showed the world that they can't fuckin' break us
no matter what the hell they do.
Y'know, it... It gave me a little hope,
made me feel a little better, and I just wanna say
fuckin' thank you for that, man. That's all.
What's your name?
Uh, my name's Larry, uh...
Can I shake your hand, Larry?
-You wanna shake my hand? -Yeah.
It's gonna be all right.
Yeah?
I'm gonna be okay, right?
So you're gonna be okay.
-Yeah. -[laughing] Yeah.
-Yeah. -All right.
-Hey, go Sox. -Thank you.
Go Sox.
[man] Go Sox. [woman] Go Sox.
[Larry] Let's go, Sox!
-Let's go get that beer. -[woman] Mr Bauman?
Hi. Um...
My daughter here actually wrote a report on you
-for her third grade class. -[Jeff] Oh, yeah?
What's your name?
Sophie. Do your legs hurt?
[Jeff] Uh, sometimes. Yeah.
What'd you get on your report?
I got an A-minus.
[man] Just wanna share this with you...
[woman] 2009, I ran the Boston Marathon...
[man] The 89th floor of the South Tower, but...
[woman] ...and I remember going through that...
[man] ...confirmed there were 77 people on that floor,
67 died.
[man] The only reason they got out was because...
All right.
[sighs] Y'know, I did the best I could with what I had.
You did all right, Ma.
And I... I just wish I'd done better for ya.
You did all right, Ma.
You're gonna be a wonderful father.
[sighs] All right.
[Patty] You're all right there, Jeffie.
We're good?
[Jeff] I'm good.
The pursuit of love is his life's work.
But looking good is only half the story.
To seal the deal, he must charm her with his dance.
When it comes to courting a partner,
this superb bird of paradise is not the only bird
with an extraordinary display.
But as we'll see,
in the world of dancing birds,
it's only the most charming that succeed.
This is New Guinea,
the world's largest jungle-covered island.
In these isolated mountains and valleys,
birds have evolved
some of the most bizarre courtship displays on the planet.
-Meet the King of Saxony. -[high-pitched trilling]
He has the longest head feathers of any bird.
And they're vital for impressing a female.
But first, the king must advertise for a queen.
He shares the canopy with hundreds of birds,
but is the right one, here for him?
Mm. That could be her.
Time to head down to his display vine.
She's definitely up there...
but he needs her closer.
And when she is,
he can begin his routine.
She will judge him on everything.
How high he swings.
The length of his head feathers.
And how he shakes them.
The higher he scores,
the more likely she'll choose him.
It's decision time.
So, is he the king of the swings?
It seems not.
Oh, well,
back to the search.
Attracting the perfect partner
is a challenge for all male birds of paradise.
So some increase their chances
by having a permanent address.
An old, wobbly tree stump.
The top is just three meters off the forest floor.
It doesn't look much,
but it means everything
to this black sicklebill.
Or SB for short.
Every morning, SB comes here
in the hope of attracting a female.
And if he can't always be seen...
-[raucous chirruping] -he can be heard.
Even in the dense understory, his calls travel far.
And, when it comes to first impressions,
he has a neat trick up his sleeve.
For years, no one knew why
the black sicklebill had these strange shoulder plumes.
But then, who could have imagined... this?
With no shortage of food in these forests,
male birds of paradise can focus on one thing...
-attracting a mate. -[warbling electronic sound]
His shiny badge of feathers is a sign that he's in tip-top condition.
He just needs a female to spot it.
But, with no sign of any interest,
SB gets on with his day.
The sicklebill
is not the only pole-dancing bird in these forests.
The top of this 25-meter tree
has been fashioned into the perfect display post,
-by a twelve-wired bird of paradise. -[suggestive '60s music]
Let's call him... TW.
From up here, TW's call
is loud enough to carry to the other side of the valley.
Sadly, no one seems to be listening.
But if a female came by,
would she be impressed with these moves?
Or that tail?
Twelve-wires are the only birds in the world
with a tail like this,
and it's designed for a very odd kind of courtship.
He just needs a female on his pole.
SB's post has a visitor,
but it's a young male.
He's not having a bad feather day,
it's just his shoulder pads haven't developed yet.
And his shiny badge of feathers...
well, they wouldn't impress anyone.
But you're never too young to try out your moves.
Pretty good,
even if he does look like he's been dragged through the forest backwards.
TW's pole has a visitor, too,
but it's a metallic starling.
Keen to let others know he's in the area.
The pole is also a great vantage point for spying prey.
It seems that every bird in the forest
wants to sit on TW's post.
But if he's ever to attract a mate,
TW must drive off the stream of trespassers.
Now, where are all those female twelve-wires?
Surely there's one out there.
Scruffy is still at it.
And SB's not happy.
The kid's got guts
but he has to go.
SB knows that no pole means no dates.
Back in charge,
it's guns out...
hood up.
-All he needs is a passing female. -[warbling electronic sound]
Could this be the one?
It is a female
but not a sicklebill.
Male birds of paradise can go their entire lives
without ever winning a female.
But they're programmed to persevere.
An approaching storm is not good news.
SB knows there's no point dancing in the rain.
Female birds of paradise never look for partners
in bad weather.
Or almost never.
Here's a female that doesn't mind the rain.
TW can't have gone far.
But females have little patience.
Who knows when she'll be back.
TW spends a lot of time gardening and landscaping.
It's important work if he wants his display pole
to stand out in the canopy.
He's already removed all the leaves from here.
This lot could go, too.
But gardening must wait.
He has a date.
So, will a leafy gift help to woo her?
No.
For a male bird of paradise,
-life can often be frustrating. -[buzzing continues]
But she hasn't given up on him yet.
He just needs to charm her onto his pole.
Strangely,
female twelve-wires like to be flicked across the face
by a male's tail.
And she'll judge him on this.
So, here goes.
Unfortunately, his technique... is a turn-off.
The pole dancers spend a lot of time hoping they'll be noticed.
But SB's wait could be over.
That tweak is a good sign.
But she needs a much closer inspection.
The devil's in the detail.
He's passed the test.
Perseverance has paid off.
Using a tree stump as a display post is one thing.
But for some dancing birds,
the females demand even more.
They expect their partners to get creative.
This is a bower.
A stick bower.
It's built to attract a female bowerbird.
Though you could say it's the designer
that really catches the eye.
A flame bowerbird.
The world's most brightly colored bird.
He spent several days building his bower,
and now he's applying the finishing touches.
But Flame's is not the only kind of bower here.
This bower is probably the most ambitious construction
made by any single animal.
Here's the guy responsible.
MacGregor's bowerbird.
He may not have the sex appeal of Flame,
but no other bird goes to greater heights to impress the ladies.
Unlike Flame,
MacGregor spends most of the year
tinkering with his bower.
He works hard on making it bigger and better.
So far, it's been a seven-year labor of love.
Flame's bower, on the other hand, is short-lived,
likely to last just a couple of weeks.
Even so, every stick has its place.
And detail is everything.
Happy with his bower,
Flame moves his attention to his backyard.
If he wants to impress a female, it's important to get this right, too.
For both, creating the perfect piece of art is time-consuming work.
And occasionally frustrating.
If only he had hands.
This isn't MacGregor.
It's his neighbor and rival from along the way.
With no one in,
he's come to cause trouble.
Bowerbirds can be very jealous.
But there's a point to this vandalism.
Sabotage your rival's bower...
and yours may look better to a visiting female.
Mister Flame is still having his own personal battles,
but he must also watch his back.
When you're the brightest thing in the jungle,
there's always a chance you'll attract the wrong kind of bird.
A Doria's hawk.
But he's lost the element of surprise.
MacGregor is back.
And he gets on with the repairs.
His tower is well over a meter tall.
It may be a cliche, but size matters to female bowerbirds.
If a male can build and maintain a large tower, it's a sign of good genes.
Next, MacGregor turns his attention to the decor.
Every bowerbird works in his own medium.
For MacGregor, it's sticky plant sap.
Mm. Nice!
Flame is decorating, too, but he's more... experimental.
MacGregor, however, knows just what he wants.
And everything has its place.
Now, this has potential.
But should it go here?
Here?
Or perhaps here?
Or even here?
Perfect.
Fresh decorations show that the bower is in use.
And the fancier it is, the more likely it'll impress a female.
He's hung hundreds of baubles already.
But apparently, there's a point
when there's just one too many.
In keeping with his brown color scheme,
MacGregor is hoping dead flowers will be an added attraction.
Decor is often down to local fashion.
In this valley, blue is the thing.
So will these berries catch the eye?
There's another unwelcome guest at MacGregor's.
This could be bad.
But it's also an opportunity for MacGregor to practice an important skill.
Mimicry.
Pretty impressive.
And how about his squealing pig?
He can also do... the local dogs.
Pigs don't like dogs.
So, what will this pig think about a bark with more bite?
There's more to this mimicry than scaring pigs.
It's also key to courting a partner.
He's in luck.
A female has heard him and drops in for a closer look.
Time for the blind audition.
He must now give her his full repertoire.
First up, the songs of forest birds.
Moving on to other sounds he's picked up
from a nearby village.
Like chopping wood.
-[chatters in human-like voice] -People talking.
And, most remarkably...
children playing!
She's impressed.
And who wouldn't be?
-A final dog bark... -[barks]
and it's on to stage two.
A game of hide and seek.
To keep her keen, he can't be seen.
This teasing game can go on for 20 minutes or more.
Flame is in luck, too.
A female flame has come to check him out.
She replies to his call, a good sign.
Now, how to coax her into his bower?
Will contracting and expanding his pupil be the right lure?
She seems to like it.
One more step and she'll be in his bower.
Oh. Too much eye work, perhaps.
Back at MacGregor's, it's time for the crazy thistle head.
She's seen enough...
but perhaps she'll be back later.
The game's not yet up for Flame.
His date is back.
And he's trying something new.
He still needs to get her into his bower,
and a bit of blue beak bling
might be just the thing.
At last, she's right where he wants her.
Time for his signature dance:
the matador.
-[squawks] -Oh, dear! The pressure's getting to him.
Take two.
Everything seems to be going like clockwork.
His final move is odd.
But it's all part of the routine.
And this is his only contribution to fatherhood.
Bowerbirds play the mating game alone.
But in the jungles of Central and South America,
there are some birds whose only hope of finding love
is teamwork.
This is a Guianan cock-of-the-rock.
Every morning, a posse of males gathers in this patch of forest
in the hope of some female action.
They're not exactly friends but they need one another to succeed.
So, chaos must give way to order.
This is a communal display ground,
or lek.
At the lek,
every male has his own dancing area.
And the more males there are,
the more likely females will visit.
Teamwork is even more important for some performers in Panama.
This is the dancing perch
of a male lance-tailed manakin.
But to attract a female,
one manakin just won't cut it.
So... he has a wingman.
The manakins here are part of a 21-year study,
and this pair has worked together for five years.
They're a well-oiled machine.
And the most successful duo in this forest.
Rehearsal over,
the pair go in search of a mate.
They advertise their readiness with a duet.
And their calls have been answered.
Now, they show her their stage with a round of flybys.
So far, so good.
But will their routine hit the mark?
If it does, only the alpha will mate.
The wingman's only here
to make his boss look good.
But, before deciding,
female manakins always check out the competition.
Oh, shame!
At the cock-of-the-rock lek,
the judges are taking their seats.
It's got the posse excited again.
Order restored, each takes his position.
And presents his best side.
They'll be judged on their rear ends.
It takes a trained eye to spot the prettiest bottom.
But there's more to the contest than that.
Wait for it...
Yeah, okay, it's not exactly Swan Lake,
but it's enough to make the final choice easier.
But is this male as impressive... up close?
He must keep hopping until he gets the okay.
Not everyone's best pleased about that.
But the competition isn't over yet.
There are still other females to win over,
so they must keep hopping.
But when the next female chooses...
it's the same guy!
Research has shown that most matings
at a lek are with one male.
But only the females know
what he has that the others don't.
Still, until the last female's gone, there's always hope.
The manakin A-team are hopeful, too.
The female's back.
And the duo picks up where they left off.
But the final act... is a solo.
So, when it's time to go it alone,
the alpha calls at his wingman to leave.
Last year, this male was the most successful in the study.
But he can't afford to relax.
Research has shown that older females, like this one,
make experienced males work harder for their affections.
So he must dazzle her with each of his dance moves.
Now comes the highlight of the whole performance.
Cue drumroll...
The perch bounces.
She likes them!
All that's left is to bow...
and mate.
The wingman can only look on.
Perhaps next year, he'll be on top.
Back in New Guinea,
there's one dancing bird that has it all...
the perfect arena,
the most varied dance routine,
and he does it all by himself.
You could say... he's the greatest showman.
This is his personal display court.
He's a bird of paradise,
-[high-pitched squawk] -a Carola's parotia,
and his name's Bob.
Bob is obsessed with tidiness.
But it's vital housework.
Female Carolas don't visit messy display courts.
Every leaf must go.
Perfect.
But Bob's jobs are not done.
There's other groundwork to do.
His arena is carpeted with moss.
And there are a few areas to attend to.
Splendid!
Chores finished, Bob limbers up.
Carolas spend more time rehearsing their displays
than any other bird of paradise.
The ballerina is just one of nine carefully choreographed moves.
And each will have to be done in exactly the right order,
making it the most complex dance of any bird.
Even the pauses between moves are important to the routine.
And it's not just what he does but where.
Dancing under his perch is crucial,
as it's from here a female will view his performance.
But even the most serious dancer can tire of practicing.
Particularly when no one's even watching.
-So, it's off to lunch. -[chirrups]
With Bob gone,
others slide in.
A juvenile male
and his equally juvenile male friend.
One day, they'll both have their own courts
but until then, they must seize every chance to practice.
With two, they can role-play.
A dancer...
and a judging female.
But time's up.
Bob's back.
This youngster wants to stick around
and learn from an expert.
But playtime is over.
And not a moment too soon.
A female Carola.
But she's not looking for love.
She's after nest material.
Best get rid of her.
When you're a Carola's parotia,
there's no such thing as downtime.
To succeed, Bob knows his routine must be faultless.
So it's practice, practice, practice.
Aha! Another female!
This one seems interested in him,
so it's showtime.
Bob opens with a perch pivot,
the first of his nine moves.
With the female getting closer, it's time for move two.
The court hops.
Then smartly onto move three,
the swaying bounce.
The mossy carpet helps keep Bob's feet firmly on the ground.
But he needs her on his perch.
Yes!
But what's this?
A plus-one?
-[squawks shrilly] -It's another adult male.
He could prove trouble but Bob must press on.
A Carola display could last hours.
And there are points for stamina.
The arrival of a second male is more worrying.
Suddenly, Bob's surrounded by rivals,
here to break up his date.
If he loses focus now, she may visit one of their courts instead.
And he's still got a lot to get through.
Next, move four.
The head tilts.
But all that noise is just too distracting.
He must show them who's boss.
And this bit of leaf could be the answer.
It's a badge of ownership, a Carola's way of saying:
"This is my court. Get lost."
It's odd...
but it works.
But now, something's wrong.
Has she lost interest,
or is he trying to woo her at the wrong end of the perch?
Fortunately,
Bob's remembered that female Carolas
like to look down on their would-be partners.
So it's back to business, and the second round of court hops.
Move five.
Now on to the next move:
the hop and shake.
Number six,
where he'll fluff his feathers, shuffle forward,
and stick his head under his wing.
Fluff, shuffle, wing.
Fluff...
shuffle... wing.
Still looking good above.
So it's time for moves seven, eight and nine.
The bow, ballerina and head bobs,
the moves that mark him out as surely the finest dancer of them all.
Take it away, Bob!
Some male Carolas never win the female...
but Bob's chances are looking good.
Even the pauses are holding her interest.
Fluttering wings are her way of saying: "Nice job, Bob."
It's the sign he's been hoping for.
Hurrah!
-But despite Bob's virtuoso performance... -[squawks]
[narrator] In your homes, listening to this broadcast. There it is again, the sharp jab from Miguel Galíndez,
There it is again, the sharp jab from Miguel Galíndez,
limiting the movements of a confused "Tremendo" Duarte.
Friends, he's having a hard time this round.
And Bayoneta is here again, pushing forward and imposing himself on the ring.
And Bayoneta is here again, pushing forward and imposing himself on the ring. The hook Duarte had to take! The unfortunate boxer from Juriquilla!
The hook Duarte had to take! The unfortunate boxer from Juriquilla!
He's been knocked out much too early in the match.
The referee is already doing the safety countdown.
One, two, three, four.
Are you OK?
These things happen, dude.
OK?
There, there.
Hey, kid, it's not your fault. Come on. Come on.
-[man cries] -It's OK. -Calm down. -[man cries]
-Hey, hey, wait, come on. -[man cries]
-Hey, hey, hey. -Don't do that! Don't!
-[woman] Miguel? -Miguel! Fuck, stop it!
-[woman] What's wrong with Miguel? -[man] The doctor is coming.
What's wrong?
-What's wrong? -[Miguel cries]
Hey, good morning.
-[background conversations] -Bye-bye!
Where the hell are you?
Where the hell are you, man?
Where the hell are you?
Where was it?
Dude.
Hey, dude, raise your elbow, you know? Keep it straight up, always.
[man] Hey, Mickey!
-I need you here. -[Miguel] Yeah.
The Mexican is not going to let you breathe, at least not in the early rounds.
So you keep on moving. You use your diagonals.
-Let's go, show him. -OK.
So, you've got to work Carmona from a distance, all the time.
If he shortens the distance, you try to escape, like this.
So, keep it all the time.
-Good? -OK, now you block his way.
-OK. -OK, so, this way.
And now this way.
-This way, yeah, block, block! -I see.
-This way, yeah, block, block! -I see. Block, down. Good, this way. Again.
Block, down. Good, this way. Again.
Block. Yeah, good.
-Now, you're going to meet Tony. -Yeah, OK.
[in Finnish] Is anyone going to sauna?
[knocks] You wanted to see us?
[owner] Yeah, come on in, both.
[owner] Sit down, sit down.
OK. Are we on schedule with Remu?
Yeah. He's on point, physically.
Yeah, and Carmona is not the same as he was before.
Five years ago, he would've killed him, but I think now we have a chance.
[in Finnish] Fuck, fuck! God damn it!
You're ready for the sparring sessions?
I hate it too, this cold weather.
It's like when we were in Buffalo, remember?
No, this is much worse.
I don't hate it. It just makes me too aware of everything.
Too aware of my body.
Listen, Mickey. We'll go through this fight, Remu wins, make some money to start over again.
We'll go through this fight, Remu wins, make some money to start over again.
Then, we might go our separate ways, but it won't happen like this,
-when you're late every fucking morning. -Yeah.
Yeah, maybe this was a mistake, no?
[woman in Spanish] Hello?
Hello?
Who's this?
-[girl] Who's this? -[woman] Hang up, Yovana.
Yovana.
[Miguel] Come on!
[man] Focus on the body, and get out.
-[in French] Shit! -Long punches, Remu!
It's on fire!
Hey, cool off, man. It's not going to be so easy with Carmona.
Stretch your arms, man, you look like a kid.
How do you think you're going to hit him with those tiny arms?
Jump in, Mexican bitch.
Come on, fucking jump in, let's dance.
-Yeah, keep going. -You want to jiggle with this?
[Remu] Fucking punk.
[in Finnish] All right, again! Go on. Leave him no chance!
[in Finnish] Remu! Are you gonna win the championship for us?
Sarita. Look.
-What? -He's my Mexican friend, Mickey. Sarita.
-[Miguel] Hey. -[Remu] Want a beer?
-[Miguel] Sure. -One beer, and a soda water for me.
-[Miguel] Is she your wife? -[Remu] No, you're married?
-[Miguel] Is she your wife? -[Remu] No, you're married? [Miguel] I have a daughter.
-For your daughter. -[Miguel] Cheers.
[Remu] Cheers.
You're doing great, man. Your legs are moving better now.
All I know is giving and taking punches.
Yeah, well. I guess we can call that a job.
Hey, I'll be back in a second.
[in Finnish] OK, hey.
-Need anything, Mickey? -[Miguel] No.
What was your name, again?
The blows to the head must be affecting your memory.
[Sarita] Sarita.
Sarita. That's a Mexican name.
Do I look Mexican to you?
[in Finnish] Karaoke here this Saturday.
-[Miguel] What's up? -What's up?
[Miguel] I came to see Ramiro.
Come on in.
[boy] Dad. Someone's looking for you.
-What's up, dude? It's the Yeti himself! -[Miguel] How are you.
-How are you, Baby? -How have you been?
-I'm good, and you? -I'm great, what's up?
-Not much. -That's a big secret you kept from me.
So you already told those Vikings everything about me?
The only thing "baby" about you is your nickname, right?
The only thing "baby" about you is your nickname, right? Screw that "baby" thing. Hey, son!
Screw that "baby" thing. Hey, son! -Come here. -[Miguel] What's up?
-Come here. -[Miguel] What's up?
-[boy] Hi. -Even though he looks like a mangy dog,
he was the best at the delegation of 2004.
-[boy] Oh? -"Bayoneta" Galíndez, medal winner.
-[boy] Oh? -Nice to meet you. [boy] Nice to meet you.
-Remember, you horn bag? -Me?
You were trying to fuck all the Chinese synchronized swimmers.
And you were trying to fuck the entire Olympic village.
-That was something dude. -It really was, man.
-[Roberto] Mr. Nacho, look who's here! -Hi, Mr. Nacho.
-[Ramiro] It's been a while. -Oh, yes. How are you?
I was glad to hear you were working here.
Oh, thanks.
And with that fucker, Denis. How did that happen?
And with that fucker, Denis. How did that happen? -[Miguel sighs] -What happened there?
Well... It was a huge surprise for me too, to be honest.
[boy] Hey, Mickey.
-Did you show our style to the Vikings? -Shut up, dude.
Hey, in all honesty, what's that guy's kryptonite?
Should I kick his balls, or bite his tits?
Put a bottle of vodka in his dressing room, and you'll see.
[man] Hey, Mickey. A gift.
-Oh, come on! -Nice!
-Are you going to eat them here? -Yes, this is nice, man.
-[Rodrigo laughs] Cool. -Spicy, man.
-You brought the sauce? -[man] Sure do!
[woman] Hello?
-[woman] Hello? -[Miguel] Erika.
[Erika] Miguel?
How's Yovana?
[Erika] Is it really you?
[Erika] Is it?
[Erika] Weren't you dead?
I'd like to talk to her, if you don't mind.
[Erika] She grew up, Miguel.
I want to help, Erika.
I want you to be able to count on me.
I'd like to be a father for Yovana, and...
I have a job here. I'm about to get some money...
And I want to come back.
I want my life back.
[Erika] So you're back from the dead, after four years?
[Denis] Hey, Mickey! You can come up here, we need you.
[Denis] Mickey!
[referee] I want a clean fight no holding, no hitting below the belt.
Good luck and have a good fight.
Keep moving. Fight from the outside, and don't stay on the ropes too long.
[Miguel] Come on, Remu.
[Miguel] Come on, Remu, good.
[Miguel] Be careful.
-Get out of there! -Stay out of reach, man, come on!
Stay closer.
Don't let him to get so close. If he gets his teeth on you, he won't let go.
[Remu] Look at his eye. I can knock him out, boss, I can take him out.
[Denis] Hey, move forward, move forward!
[referee] Hey, let him go!
Hey, hey, hey! The mouthpiece! He's wining time. That's fucking low, you bastard!
Two, three, four.
You've got the points. Don't do anything foolish.
OK.
[referee] OK, go to your corner.
-[bell rings] -Go!
Watch his jab, watch his jab!
-[Denis] Come on, kid! -[Nacho] Hit him, hit him!
-[bell ringing] -Why are you stopping now?
[Denis] Why'd you stop the fight now? Why the fuck did you stop now?
[Denis] Don't stop, come on. He spits his fucking mouthpiece and you stop the fight?
Jesus Christ, man.
[man in Finnish] Go on, Jyrki! Kill him!
-[Jyrki] I invested in this. -[man] Yes, you did. I know.
-[Miguel] You OK? -[Jyrki] Better than ever.
[Jyrki] It's not every day you lose...
a big match like that.
Yeah. Come on, have a drink. -No, I'm good. -Hey, take it.
-No, I'm good. -Hey, take it. -I'm good. -Take a drink, you know? Let's celebrate.
-I'm good. -Take a drink, you know? Let's celebrate. [in Finnish] Come on! A little sip of jallu. Go on, take some!
[in Finnish] Come on! A little sip of jallu. Go on, take some!
Hey! Come on!
-Easy, easy. Huh? -Hey!
You know? It was my fault.
-[man speaking Finnish] -[Jyrki] I chose wrong, you know?
[Jyrki] Jaakko! God damn it!
[Jaakko] Hey, hey. Like... what, Jyrki?
-[Jyrki] You can't fucking-- -[Jaakko] What? Come on, Jyrki! Hello!
It's me, Jaakko. Come on, now! Seriously!
-Everything's OK! -OK, I get it.
[in Finnish] I get it, I get it.
-God damn it. -[Jaakko] Oh, Jyrki, look at you...
-God damn it. -[Jaakko] Oh, Jyrki, look at you... -[Jaakko] Nighty night. -[Jyrki] Go away.
-[Jaakko] Nighty night. -[Jyrki] Go away.
[Jaakko] Thank you, Mr. Jaakko, for taking care of a friend.
-[Jaakko] Let's go! -Where?
-Let's go to the bar. To the bar, yeah? -No, I'm OK, thanks.
Let's get a couple of drinks. No?
Bayoneta.
You think he's OK? [Jaakko] He's OK. Better than ever, you know?
[Jaakko] Crazy, right?
-What? -Ice hockey. Violent game for simpletons.
Actually, fights are not allowed in real hockey.
It's an American thing. It's pure simulations. Show business.
When one of the knees touches the ice, the fighting stops, and the game goes on.
Boxing is...
More dreadful. It's more like life, you know?
I saw you in Austin.
When you knocked out that Nicaraguan, what was his name?
-Yeah, Madrigal Rivas. -Yes! He was a... a serious...
-Yeah, Madrigal Rivas. -Yes! He was a... a serious... anesthetist. A real knock-out artist.
anesthetist. A real knock-out artist.
A no-brain, but some don't need it.
You made a lot of people lose money that night.
You were a five to one on the dock, Bayoneta.
I never liked that nickname. I think it's stupid.
Perhaps. Bayoneta is a rustic weapon.
Perhaps. Bayoneta is a rustic weapon. For peasants. Your thing was always more subtle.
For peasants. Your thing was always more subtle.
Yeah, that's the kind of thing people say when they're behind a microphone.
Maybe, but... journalists will see you always with a mixture of...
Maybe, but... journalists will see you always with a mixture of... -respect, envy, and pity. Its-- -Why envy? You can write your whole life.
-respect, envy, and pity. Its-- -Why envy? You can write your whole life.
[Jaakko laughs] But there are eternal boxers too. Take a look at Carmona.
No way, no. Carmona, he's just searching for the last bit of applause.
And he's searching for the last few dollars.
You see? That's the kind of thing you people will never understand.
When you're hungry and healthy, nobody cares what can happen to you.
But, when you start making serious money,
a doctor shows up and says: "No more."
But that wasn't what happened to you.
You got an early retirement after that fight with "Tremendo" Duarte.
But I'm surprised you even know about that.
It was talked about, you know?
-Especially because of all the rumors-- -What rumors?
What the fuck are you talking about? What do you know about that?
Those were all lies, you know?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply anything.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply anything. Good.
-Look at me. I'm sorry. -It's all good.
Miguel. Please, I'm sorry.
-[Sarita] You! -[man] Can I have another one?
[Sarita] Yes.
You have a touch for beer.
There you go.
Just the right amount of foam.
I sure didn't know you were an expert.
There's a lot of things you don't know about me.
I'll buy you a drink.
Of all the places in the world, I never thought I would end up here.
I mean, if you put a map in front of me and ask: "Hey, Mickey, where's Finland?"
I'd have no idea.
I mean, I knew it was near London, or something, but...
Yeah, well, I have no idea where Tijuana is.
That... is a hole, at the border with the "gringos."
You're not missing anything.
-But there's sun, right? -Yes.
Here, it's always night.
You get used to it, I guess. Why Finland?
I came to train Remu.
So you retired from boxing, but you couldn't stay away?
I guess.
You should.
Oh. Is this yours?
Yup. I know. Old and dead, like my soul.
You should go, before you freeze to death.
[narrator] Galíndez keeps showing great leg power
despite the punishment received at the hands of the Nicaraguan.
He tries again with a jab. He tries again to combine them,
and he takes a breather to try to find possible gaps in Madrigal's defenses.
Watch out! That left punch did hurt, Galíndez moves, he's taken to the ropes.
One, two, another left punch, and the referee stops the fight!
Gentlemen, another triumph for this boy, Galíndez, who went against all odds
and imposes himself against Madrigal Rivas, a seasoned fighter!
He celebrates in his corner. Let's watch the replay.
The moment when Galíndez penetrates Madrigal Rivas' defenses, with technique.
Watch out for him, he could be one of the next aces of Mexican boxing.
Watch out for him, he could be one of the next aces of Mexican boxing. I'm talking of course of Bayoneta and his strong right arm,

-Hi. -Hey.
-You came in early. -Yeah, I couldn't sleep.
Mickey, there's something I have to tell you.
What?
Jyrki is bankrupt.
He thought the fight would bail him out, so he mortgaged the gym. He can't pay us.
What are we going to do?
We can only wait.
Motherfucker.
[in French] Shit!
IS THIS YOUR NUMBER, DAD?
Hi.
[Denis] Good, good. OK, great!
Very good. Nice.
Miguel. What are you doing here?
Could you train me again?
-[Denis] What? -You heard me.
I want to fight. I want you-- I want you to train me again.
-[Denis] Are you fucking crazy? -No.
I can do it. I still have something to give.
I need the money. I need the money for my daughter. We need the money. We do.
I need the money. I need the money for my daughter. We need the money. We do. -[bell ringing] -[Denis] Time!
I realized it's the only way, you know?
We do a good fight.
And then we can stop thinking about that every fucking day.
No. OK? Get that idea out of your head.
[Denis] Good!
-[Jyrki] There's 30, and four. -[Miguel] Hey.
[man in Finnish] OK, I'll take it from here.
So now you know.
The lease on the building expires in two months.
Then I'm out on the street.
-Sorry I lied to you. -That's OK.
Doesn't matter anymore.
I need to fight.
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah.
Some days, I wake up and I feel this...
hole in my chest.
And I think... I can't stop thinking.
Crazy shit.
I don't have to know your reasons, Mickey.
I'll pay you. We all help one another.
-Hey, Mickey. -Hey.
You're exaggerating, it's not so cold.
How did you make a living after you retired?
[Miguel] I worked in a cruise ship, doing the laundry.
And once, the singer of the ship got sick, so I did the show.
-Now you're lying. -I don't lie.
-Yes, you lie. -I don't.
-[Sarita] I don't believe you. -[Miguel] It was a huge success.
[Miguel] The ladies were all over me.
-Come on. Sing for me. -No.
I knew you were a liar.

[Sarita] Hey, are you coming?
Sure.
[in Finnish] Hi. Did everything go well?
Yes. He had his evening meal and went to bed already.
That's great. Thank you so much.
-Be safe. -I will.
I'll be back in a minute.
Can I ask you one thing?
You want to know who the man in the photo is?
Yes, how do you know?
I can see it in your face.
He was my husband.
You're divorced?
No.
Remu's friend?
I thought you wanted to ask one question.
It was his brother.
I'm going to close my eyes now.
-Hi. -Hi.
[Sarita] Are you hungry?
Yes.
So?
This isn't your country, Mickey. Nobody cares about ruins.
But, as it turns out,
call it a morbid curiosity, or whatever,
your comeback interested a couple of promoters.
April 25th, Sweden. An interesting prospect.
Undefeated. All by knockout.
They want you as a stepping stone.
-They're going to be surprised. -How much?
-After taxes, 2 thousand, for you. -Good.
They can pay some upfront. To help our camp.
[Jyrki] So it's a good start. Now it's up to you.
Who's going to coach me?
Come on, tell him.
[Denis] I don't want to waste my time.
-You won't? -You sure you really want to do this?
I am.
-OK! -[Jyrki] So, it's done.
Now, you do your thing.
Yes.
Hey, hey. Stop eating that shit in my office.
-Now, get the fuck out of here. -OK.
OK, let's go!
[Denis] Corner him!
Work the body, I said.
Where'd you leave your legs, Bayoneta?
[Denis] Not so easy, huh? Get up and move faster.
-[Denis] Come on. -[Jyrki] Come on!
-[Miguel] Are you done with that? -One more.
Yes, one more now.
What?
You see that guy at the car? Outside?
He was one of the few who took my brother down.
You knew I had a brother, Mickey? He was a fighter too.
I watched him get up early in the morning every day to go training.
And I thought to myself, if anybody wants to get up at 4 a.m. to get a beating
it's got to be a great thing to do.
I really looked up to him. I begged him to take me training.
He was so tough, you know? He fought almost every weekend.
He never got knocked down until his 56th fight.
First time he got knocked down, we even celebrated it.
He was a true journeyman.
But then, as time went on, he started getting knocked down more often.
He'd mostly spring right up again, you know? But...
there was a day when he didn't get up.
It was a bad neurological problem, but he didn't tell.
Not us, not me, or Sarita. And they just had the boy, Emery.
The doctor told him he had to stop fighting.
But he didn't give a damn.
He just kept taking punches like a madman, till Sarita found out about his condition,
and threatened to take the boy away if he didn't stop.
And then...
Then, he took the ferry to Sweden.
He took his last drink, and...
he jumped into the water, and that was it.
Why are you telling me this?
You're a good man, Mickey.
No, I'm not.
I never met a good guy in this business.
I'm a good guy.
Yes, I fight, but...
I don't want to hurt anyone.
Come on!
You won't last two rounds like that, come on!
Come on, Miguel!
-OK, time. -Fuck.
Can we do this inside?
Can we do this inside? It's the same.
[Denis] Time.
Go, Bayoneta, go!
Give me one second.
Hey, Mickey, what the fuck?
-[Remu speaks Finnish] -Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for not answering my fucking messages.
I'm sorry, I've been pretty busy.
You told me you were retired.
Yes.
Remu told me about his brother. About your husband.
I didn't call you because I didn't want to cause you more problems.
Yeah, I can take care of myself. I get to do my own decisions.
-[Denis] Mickey, get back here. -Yes, I'm coming.
Go.
[Denis] Those legs are much better now.
Why don't you try to do something with them?
I remember when we were young, we used to go all the time on this cruise ship,
get drunk, smoke cigarettes, it was easier to get that stuff.
One time, on this one boat, I didn't like the DJ,
so I walked upstairs, on top of him, and took a piss on his neck.
Then both guards came after us, but we got away.
-It's me, Jyrki. -Come in.
Hey.
-Tomorrow's the big day. -Yes.
-Who's she? -My daughter.
Don't we look alike?
It's funny, how things happen.
You know? I know you'll make it.
I knew you could make a comeback. I never doubted it.
I'm so thirsty, man. I could drink the whole ocean.
I told Denis I wanted you to be his assistant.
I still believe that accident isn't enough to break a guy like you.
I would've liked to know you then. Your strength.
Your determination.
I wanted my boys to learn that.
To follow your example. Yeah, well.
I'm pretty sure I'm not everything you're saying, but thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[in Finnish] Seems like everyone bet their money on you. How does it feel?
[in Finnish] I don't care about money at all. I've trained hard
for this fight, that's all I care about.
Galíndez. Suddenly, you decide to reappear out of nowhere.
How does it feel to get your gloves back on after so long?
I feel confident. We trained hard.
I'm as hungry as I was in my first fight.
[Jaakko] Five years ago, your career came into
what at the moment seemed like an abrupt and premature end.
What made you decide to make a comeback?
Well, hmm,
this is the only thing I know how to do.
[Yovana in Spanish] Hello?
[Yovana] Hello?
What's up, Yovana, how are you?
I'm your dad.
Please, don't hang up.
[Yovana] What do you want?
Well, I'm going to Tijuana, and...

[Yovana crying] Yes.
-[Yovana crying] -I was thinking we could go there, and...
And we could go to the beach, if you want.

Gunnar Gunther Balasevic!
[narrator] Dear friends, the big question that's surely on everyone's mind is
if Miguel "Bayoneta" Galíndez is ready to fight at the top of his weight class.
[referee] Start!
[Denis] Move forward! Come on, come on! OK, stay light!
[Jyrki] Come on, Mickey!
[Denis] Get him, get up! Yes!
[Denis] A little bit of action!
[Denis] It's OK, breathe, breathe!
[Denis] Yes!
[narrator] The crowd goes wild, did we witness another quick knockout
[narrator] The crowd goes wild, did we witness another quick knockout by the Scandinavian champion?
-[Denis] Come on, get up! -Mickey, wake up!
[narrator] Balasevic lands a straight ring on Bayoneta's chin,
sending him to the canvas like a rag doll.
-Yes, yes. -Yes? Keep your guard up, go!
-[referee] Let him go! -[bell ringing]
[narrator] Balasevic attacks. If the Mexican wants to counter those fists,
[narrator] Balasevic attacks. If the Mexican wants to counter those fists, he has to at least find some of that old, famous Bayoneta in him.
Keep going, man.
[Remu] Keep your distance. That's it.
[Remu] You got time, you got time!
-[Remu] Yes. -[Denis] Yes.
Come on, move forward.
[Remu] Come on, man!
[man] Go home!
To the right, didn't lose.
[Remu] Watch for his left.
[Denis] Move it, kid, move it!
[Remu] One, two. Yeah! That's it!
[narrator] Balasevic is undoubtedly one of Sweden's most talented boxers,
and his ability to take in the punches is truly admirable.
But today, he's been steamrolled by a man whose comeback
seemed unlikely after his last, tragic fight.
-[bell ringing] -[referee] Go!
[Remu] Yeah, keep your guard up.
[Denis] Come on, Miguel.
Easy. Not yet, one more round.
[Miguel] What did you say?
[Jyrki] Mickey, come on, let's go!
What did you say?
[Miguel] What did you say?
[Jaakko] And look at this, people. What is this man made of?
The Swede's chin must be made of steel, and his body of granite.
Balasevic's up. Looks like he wants to see this fight to the end, no matter what.
The fight is fixed.
-He's letting me win. -[Denis] No, Miguel, he's at your reach.
-[Denis] You can get him. -He told me: "One more round."
-He told me: "One more round." -[Denis] No, they wouldn't do that here.
-He told me: "One more round." -[Denis] No, they wouldn't do that here. He told me: "One more round." They want me to knock him on this one.

[Denis] Come on, Miguel, fight!
[Remu] Get close, come on, come on! Fight, Miguel!
[Denis] What are you doing?
[Jaakko] Something's wrong with Bayoneta,
he's hardly countering any of the punches. He turned his back to his opponent.
[Jyrki] Come on, fight! [Jyrki] Mickey, you can't do this!
[Denis] Come on, kid! What are you doing?
[narrator] Bayoneta is no longer fighting, which leads to his disqualification.
-[Denis] Fuck! -[crowd booing]

marking and limiting the movements of a confused "Tremendo" Duarte.

[narrator] We're on our 10th round, and this is madness, friends.
Who's to blame for this atrocity we're witnessing?

[Erika] Where are you going, Miguel?
Everything's in order.

You may leave.
Miguel? Miguel!
The door was open.
It makes no sense, man.
What?
All the time we spent in the ring.
For you. Take it, Miguel, It's yours.
Take it.
[Miguel] You know nothing, man.
You don't know what it's like to kill someone with your bare hands, dude.
You don't know what it's like to hit someone in the face non-stop,
You don't know what it's like to hit someone in the face non-stop, knowing you're fucking up their brain.
You don't know what it feels... to hear someone...
falling on the ring, while you already know...
you know he will not get up again.
And he doesn't.
And you start thinking about a lot of things.
About his wife.
His children, dude.
[sighs] His children, dude.
And the hardest part?
The hardest part is knowing that all that pain...
is happening because you're a fucking fraud.
-Why did you make me do it, man? -Stop it, there.
How'd you make me do it? Why don't you want to hear it?
You don't because you are just as guilty as me, man.
Just as guilty. When are you going to take responsibility for what we did?
He put that shit on the bandages.
We cheat.
You think I don't know it?
You think I don't think about it every fucking day?
I wasn't only about you and me, Mickey. There were a lot of people involved.
It was something bigger than us, and you know it.
What's up?
[Yovana] Hi.
It's me, your dad.
I know, I can see you.
[Miguel] How are you, Yovana?
It's snowing here, look.
Can you see?
[Yovana] I don't see anything.
[Yovana] You owe me 25 bucks.
For?
I wanted you to win, Miguel.

-[in Finnish] Happy birthday. -[Sarita in Finnish] Hi.
-[in Finnish] Hi. -[in Finnish] Hi.
-[Miguel] Hey. -Hey.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
-You're leaving? -Yeah.
I'm going back to Tijuana.
Do you want to come?
I could bring you and the kid.
-What would I do in such a sunny place? -Yeah.
-I had to try. -Yeah.
[Sarita] OK, who wants some cake?
[Sarita] Isn't it nice? Thanks.
[Sarita in Finnish] Is that a bit slanted?
[Sarita in Finnish] It's gorgeous. Isn't it?
[Sarita] I'm happy with it too.
-[man] Did you make this yourself? -[Sarita] Yes, I made it all by myself.
[Remu] So, the birthday boy is here.
[Sarita] This is a bit like...
[Remu] What cake is this?
I think it's a chocolate cake.
I think it's a chocolate cake. Yeah.
-[woman 1] Who's that? -[woman 2] Well, she was, um...
a transvestite from the Village who recently died.
She was a big activist.
Um, we're not sure how she died yet. Murder, maybe?
Marsha Johnson, a veteran of the Stonewall riots,
and a prominent figure among transvestites,
was found dead in the river near Christopher Street, Monday morning.
Marsha, whose real name was Malcolm Michaels Jr.,
was last seen alive on Thursday.
The police lists suicide as the cause of death,
but community leaders cite a lack of evidence,
and charge that police have yet to begin an investigation
into the death of this beloved founder of the gay movement.
A demonstration is planned for next week on Christopher Street.
Marsha was 46 years old and is survived by four brothers and two sisters.
She will be greatly missed.
[Sue Yacka] Do we have everyone?
Let's start with the most recent incident, which happened over the weekend.
A 35-year-old transgender woman was attacked
outside of her home in Jackson Heights, Queens.
Um, last we heard was that the survivor
is not yet conscious or able to communicate,
and they've not been in a position where we could offer support.
She had her head smashed against the curb of a sidewalk
by, uh, someone who has fled and has not yet been apprehended.
[Victoria] Keep us posted. [Catherine Santos] And let us know what you need.
[Sue] Remember, the Nettles case is back in court this Friday.
[Victoria] Yeah, we'll be there.
[Victoria] I've been working for the LGBTQ Anti-Violence project for many years,
and I'm about to retire.
But there's a massive number of trans women who have been murdered,
and their cases have just gone cold.
And they're yelling out from their graves...
for justice.
Most of them were unknown,
but even famous people, cases go cold, just like Marsha.
Marsha was famous all around the world.
Her case has been cold for 25 years.
If we can't bring justice for Marsha,
how can we bring justice for all these other unsolved cases?
I wanna try to give Marsha justice before I leave.
[camerawoman] This is the memorial that the street people laid down,
where they laid Marsha's body when they pulled Marsha out of the water.
Right over the edge here.
[man] You're looking for '92, right?
[Victoria] It was July of '92.
[man] Everyone knew Marsha. Marsha was so full of life.
It's hard for me to believe that she would commit suicide.
[Victoria] Yeah, this is her case.
-I was there when they pulled her out. -[camerawoman] Yeah?
Where did you see her floating?
[man] Right over there.
She was about this... Right there, let's say.
And the head was up and the feet were down.
She wasn't floating flat, she was floating down.
And she had a hole in her head.
[camerawoman] How do you know she had a hole in her head?
-I could see it. -Really?
-[cameraman] You can't judge that... -It could be the fish--
I'm just saying it was a hole. I'm not saying what happened.
All I'm telling you is what I saw.
She didn't look anything like we knew her.
[Taylor Mead] Isn't this calming and nice to come here?
[Taylor Mead] Isn't this calming and nice to come here? They set aside this whole pier for us so we could come and relax here.
They set aside this whole pier for us so we could come and relax here.
[man on street] Marsha!
[Taylor] Marsha Johnson, Queen of the Village. One of the great...
This is one of the most courageous people in the world.
I've always loved...
I always wanted to put on drag and I never had the courage.
This is one of the people that has the courage.
And bravo for him. Her. Or whatever he wants to be.
And not only that, he doesn't give a shit
whether he wears men's clothes or women's clothes.
-Right? He's totally free. -Right. That's right.
If he feels like going out as a man, he goes out as a man.
-He feels like a woman, he's a woman. -How do you know all this?
If he feels like wearing roller skates, he wears roller skates. Whatever.
I know Marsha Johnson.
-Marsha Johnson is our queen forever. -[both laughing]
[operator] You have reached the Office of Chief Medical Examiner
for the City of New York.
My name is Victoria Cruz
and I'm inquiring about a Malcolm Michaels who was found dead in 1992.
There was an autopsy.
How would I be able to get this particular information?
[woman] Are you calling from the media or--
I'm calling from the Anti-Violence Project here in New York City.
I can give you the cause of death and the manner of death.
You would not be entitled to a full autopsy report.
If you're looking for all that paperwork,
then the family needs to request it in a written letter,
and you can get the record that way.
[Victoria] 907.
"The Michaels family."
[Jean Michaels] How are you?
-[Victoria] Pleased to meet you. -Pleased to meet you, too.
Here, I'll take this one 'cause it's much easier to get up from.
-Okay. -[Jean] Okay, go ahead.
Okay.
What do you know about the case?
I really don't know anything.
All we know is that they found him in the river.
We really don't know anything about that.
[Victoria] That's what we're investigating,
'cause we have eyewitnesses that report seeing him... her...
What do you prefer me... for me to call Marsha?
-It doesn't matter. Okay. -Okay.
When was the last time you saw her alive?
We saw her before the Fourth of July.
-Monday? Tuesday? -I don't know what day that was.
It was during the week.
She stopped by our house and I took him to the train station.
-He got on the train and that was it. -[Victoria] Okay.
Next thing we know, we got a phone call saying that he was dead.
Yeah, we sure did. We went to New York and everything.
[Victoria] And did you request to see the body or no?
My sister asked, they told her no.
They couldn't. They're not allowed to do that.
Okay.
This is the letter that we requested
in order to get the autopsy report, toxicology report
and the pictures, if some were taken.
And hopefully, we can bring some closure to her case.
Because to me, she was the Rosa Parks of the LGBT movement.
-You miss her? -Yes, I miss him.
[Robert] He adopted the name of Marsha "Pay It No Mind."
[Victoria] Pay it no mind. That's your problem, not mine.
[Robert] Anything he did, he'd have you laughing.
When he told us stories, we didn't believe him.
I'd tell him, "You're lying. You didn't know Andy Warhol.
-You didn't know those people." -[Victoria] Yes, she did!
She knew a lot of famous people. She was famous herself.
Well, she told us. We... I didn't believe her.
I thought he was joking.
Only thing that Marsha couldn't do was sing.
-Horrible. Horrible. -[Jean] No, no. No.
He could not sing.
[Jimmy Camicia] And now, ladies and gentlemen...

-[Victoria] Hi, Randy. Remember me? -[Randy Wicker] Hi.
Yes. You look very familiar.
-Yes. How are you? I like your shirt. -Fine. And yourself?
You got the same button, huh?
-Yeah, how do you like that? -How are you?
-Well, come on in the living room. -Okay.
[Randy] As you see, Marsha's a big part of my life.
[Victoria] Yes, I know.
In my opinion, I want that picture someday to be in the Schomburg Museum.
They call her "Andy Warhol model, prostitute, starring actress and saint."
-Where'd you meet Marsha? -Uh...
I had a kid who lived with me, who was like an adopted son, Roy.
That's a picture of Roy and Marsha right there.
And one night, it was, like, five degrees outside.
He said, "Could Marsha come and sleep on the living room floor?"
So Marsha came in that night and stayed for the next 12 years.
[Victoria] What do you think happened to her?
Well, it certainly was not suicide. That was an insult to the family.
No way could Marsha in any way have committed suicide.
But let's face it.
The police department, they had made up their mind.
"This case is over with. We don't wanna be bothered.
'Cause this is a nobody. This isn't a person."
Let me ask you a question.
Would you be able to give us any contacts or information that you may have?
I have worked to make this place more accessible.
Somewhere I have a printout of the names and contacts
that I consider to be the best leads. [grunts]
Oh, okay. Yeah. I found that.
We began down at the river.
-[indistinct chatter through speakers] -[Victoria] Who's "we"?
A group of Marsha's friends. Maybe 20 people.
And this was the...
[Randy over speakers] And the police have written us off as marginalized citizens.
[Victoria] That was the memorial at the pier.
That was where her body laid and damaged the sidewalk.
[through speakers] Well, I just meant...
What we're really here today to talk about is what we're gonna do
about this loss of a national treasure, this icon of the gay community,
this fire at Stonewall.
[man] The cops aren't doing their job. They're just sitting on their fat asses.
We have to send a message to these people.
We demand justice here.
Join us. Sixth precinct is not doing their job again.
We want some answers!
I knew Marsha. Marsha was the happiest person I knew.
[male protester] Yeah. Yes, she was.
[protesters] Do their job! Do their job! Do their job! Do their job!
[Joe Cooper] We know that this wasn't a suicide.
You guys closed your books on it and decided,
because she's a marginal citizen,
that you weren't going to do anything about it.
We don't agree with that,
and we want you guys to do your fucking jobs.
My name is Randy Wicker. I was the deceased's roommate.
I think the problem is that, first, it's been classified as a suicide,
and I came to believe that there was a good chance of foul play
'cause she was talking about the Mafia after her
and in a very bad state.
And we may never know what happened.
But we wanna see this investigation proceed
in an orderly and thorough manner.
And that the investigation will continue to accumulate evidence
if new evidence does become available.
I don't think that it's possible for you to schedule a meeting
that will resolve this problem to your satisfaction today.
I don't think that's possible.
We want justice here, to find out who the hell murdered Marsha,
while you fucking people are standing here not doing your fucking jobs!
-Justice for Marsha! -[Randy] Justice for Marsha!
My name is Sylvia Rivera,
and I'm giving permission to have this filmed.
When I met Marsha, I must've been 12 years old.
She was like a mother to me.
Marsha was an icon of the gay movement.
Marsha was known through the world.
Marsha and I, we were the liberators.
And the street people and the drag queens were...
the vanguard of the movement.
We were the ones that stood the forefront and fought the cops off.
And we're the ones that didn't mind getting our heads bashed in.
When I first came to the Stonewall,
I was the only drag queen there, just about.
I said, "Honey, what do you think, I'm a boy or a girl?"
They didn't answer, so I decided to go in. [chuckles]
'Cause it was a all-men's bar.
The Stonewall was a very nice campy little bar
owned by the Mafia, you know.
Gay people were not allowed in bars.
The Mafia would pay off the cops. Typical of that era.
It was hard being a drag queen back then
because they would take us into jail for no reason at all.
We lived in an era that was unreal.
I was spaced out on black beauties and scotch.
We would dance, my lover and I.
The next thing we know, the lights came on and...
Hey, we're being raided.
Queens started being filed out and being put into police cars,
and guns had been drawn.
Molotov cocktails were flying.
And I'm like, "Oh, my God, the revolution is here. Thank God."
You've been treating us like shit all these years?
Uh-uh. Now it's our turn.
[Marsha] When I got downtown, the place was already on fire.
[Marsha] When I got downtown, the place was already on fire.  Sylvia Rivera and them were over in the park having a cocktail.
Sylvia Rivera and them were over in the park having a cocktail.
And we were in the streets turning over cars
and, oh, my dear, blocking traffic
and screaming and hollering and everything.
I mean, there was a lot of bloodshed that night.
And the movement started the next day.
[reporter] The world is having to notice what it used to try to ignore.
Homosexuals no longer meekly melt away
under the blast of scorn, ridicule or hatred.
Today's gay power people are struggling
for full economic and legal recognition and acceptance.
-[reporter] Why are you here today? -Darling, I want my gay rights now.
I think it's about time the gay brothers and sisters got their rights.
-And especially the women. -[reporter laughs]
Marsha was very good-natured. She was funny. She laughed.
But that shouldn't be mistaken
for a lack of serious purpose and political intent.
[Agosto Machado] Her mission in life is going about spreading peace and goodwill.
Giving license to, "You don't have to be dressed up in a suit."
You can express yourself.
She became, to me, like a bodhisattva.
A holy person who would wander the Village
in whatever adornment she wanted, being at peace.
How will this affect your job?
Darling, I don't have a job. I'm on welfare.
I have no intentions of getting a job
as long as this country discriminates against homosexuals.
[man] Right on.
[protesters chanting] Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice!
[Karla] Sylvia was always very outspoken.
She was unrelenting. She was... Sylvia was very in-your-face.
Very intense eyes. A slash of a mouth.
A guttural laugh like Marlene Dietrich.
Sylvia was quite the serious one.
She pushed her way to the front line.
"Homes for the homeless! Food for the poor!
Gay rights! Gay rights!"
[protesters] P!
-[Sylvia] O! -[protesters] O!
-[Sylvia] W! -[protesters] W!
-[Sylvia] E! -[protesters] E!
-[Sylvia] R! -[protesters] R!
-Tell me what! -[protesters] Gay power!
-I can't hear you! -[protesters] Gay power!
A little bit louder!
[protesters] Gay power!
After a while, I think they knew that they most had to concentrate
on the area that no one was addressing for them,
and that only they could address. And that was being transgender.
[Sylvia] Marsha and I thought one day we needed to do something for our own.
That's where STAR was born.
Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries.
[Marsha] Sylvia Lee Rivera deserves all the credit for STAR.
I was just one of the queens that was behind her,
like the vice president of STAR.
She knew exactly what she was talking about.
She was talking about nobody's representing transvestites, ya know?
The one thing they had in common which bonded them,
why their name should always be connected,
is that they helped those who were on the street,
just trying to live their lives.
And a lot of them got on the street and ended up hooking or hustling
to make a buck, and they sometimes had no place to stay.
[Sylvia] Marsha and I started STAR House to keep the kids off the streets.
To get these kids get their things together.
STAR was part of the people's revolution,
and it was time for us to show the world that we are human beings.
[Victoria] I didn't know Marsha, but I became very close friends with Sylvia.
Back in the late '60s,
I was going out with Frankie, who was a bouncer at the Stonewall.
Frankie was always cheating on me,
and he was going out with Sylvia's best friend at the time.
Sylvia and I didn’t get along too well,
so I had lost sight of her for 25 years.
One day I went to a meeting, and who was there? Sylvia.
She sat right across from me, and she got up and she says, "I know you."
And I got up, too, and I says, "I know you, too."
And then this button, she had it on her left side,
popped out and it just rolled to my feet.
So one of the girls picked it up and Sylvia says,
"No, give it to her. She's one of us."
And from that moment on, we became very close friends.
We spoke to each other at least twice a week.
And she was always there for me and the community.
And I will never forget that.
When she spoke about Marsha, there was always a tear in her eyes.
She loved Marsha, and she said that that was our mother.
What's been going on with the Marsha P. Johnson case?
There seems to be conflicting evidence on the last time she was seen.
Randy said he last saw her on the second.
-[Marsha] Thank you very much, doll. -[man] My pleasure.
[Victoria] And then someone reported seeing her on the night of the fourth.
And the body was found on the sixth.
So we're gonna ask more questions of people who knew her
or reported seeing her during that time.
And that's what we're trying to find out. We'll get to the bottom of it.
Okay.
[automated voice] Please leave a message after the tone. When--
[Daniel Massanova] Can I help you?
Yes. May I speak to Daniel Massanova?
That's me. What's the matter? What's up?
Daniel, my name is Victoria Cruz. I work for the Anti-Violence Project.
I'm working on a reopened case from 1992...
-What was the name of the victim? -Marsha P. Johnson.
Are you talking about the girl off the water?
Yes.
Yeah, that was Jimmy Abreu's case.
Jimmy is retired like I am from the NYPD.
Okay, you wouldn't happen to have his number, would you?
No, I don't.
I'm trying to get in contact with a James Abreu.
[woman 1] I'm not familiar with that.
[woman 2] I don't know that person. There is nobody here named James Abreu.
-[man] Daryl. -I'm looking for a James Abreu.
Yeah, hold on. Jimmy, phone call.
[James Abreu] Hello?
-James Abreu? -Yes.
Hi, my name is Victoria Cruz. I'm working for the Anti-Violence Project.
I'm working on a reopened case on the Marsha P. Johnson case
that was... She was found in 1992 by Christopher Street Pier.
Right.
Can I meet with you in reference to this particular case?
Definitely not.
Because?
Because I'm retired from the NYPD and you're calling me at work.
Can we meet outside of your job?
No, definitely not.
I don't want to meet in regards to anything.
He didn't want to tell me anything about the case.
He doesn't wanna look back. [James] I can't control what people say to you.
-I understand. -I don't know who you represent.
I don't even know if you are who you say you are.
-Are you a lawyer? -No, I'm not.
-You a private investigator? -No.
How about I give you a little advice? Don't play detective yourself.
Leave this to the people that should handle it.
Okay.
This is me in '67.
Look at the hairdos. [chuckles]
I was doing shows at the time. I just loved the stage.
I used to do the catwalk in the city till they found out I was trans,
and then I got booted out.
Back in the '60s, it was against the law to be dressed in drag.
I was very fortunate that I was small and petite,
so I really wasn't detectable.
[chuckles] I was very careful not to get arrested.
X-rated.
This is my beach outfit, when I had the body. [chuckles]
I had a 24-inch waist.
I've been very blessed and lucky that my family accepted me.
As a matter of fact, my mother was a dressmaker,
and she was very supportive.
This was a friend of mine who got murdered back in '73.
This is him in drag. Carlos Sanchez.
We never found out who did it or... Cold case.
They just didn't care.
They were trans.
Outcasts. Society doesn't want them.
I've dealt with those feelings...
my own personal experiences.
-[Kitty Rotolo] Victoria? -Miss Kitty?
[Kitty] Hi.
-How are you? -Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you for allowing me to come.
-Thank you. -Sit, please.
Thank you so much.
-You're more than welcome. Thank you. -[sighs]
So, I heard so much about you.
[Kitty] And was it good or bad?
-[Victoria] It's all interesting. -[Kitty] Yes.
[Victoria] How did you meet Marsha?
I was probably 13 or 14 at the time.
I would always pass Sheridan Square Park.
And when I first saw Marsha,
she was just this elaborate, with feathers and plumes and...
makeup that was never put on correctly.
And Marsha was all, "Honey, you are fabulous,"
and, "You would make a beautiful girl."
She used to come by and snatch my hair up on both sides,
and it made me feel so special.
It made me feel like I wanted to be a part of that crowd.
And Marsha and I remained great friends up until the day she died.
Have you seen this? This was a flyer that was given out.
[Kitty] I remember this poster being posted in the window of Uplift,
which was Randy Wicker's store.
And Randy had, like, this little memorial going on right there.
Yes, I do remember this.
I had went in there once or twice after Marsha's death.
Just to pay my respects to him and offer my condolences to him.
I actually never read this.
"Malcolm, 46..."
Oh, Anvil icon.
Amazing, because the night that she was murdered,
her and I were supposed to go to the Anvil together.
[Victoria] Okay, tell me about that time.
I wanna say it was the Fourth of July.
I ran into Marsha in front of the Christopher Street bookstore,
and it was broad daylight. She was in full drag.
-How intoxicated was she? -Marsha was always in her right mind.
She always knew what the main prize was, you know.
We separated, and we were gonna meet at midnight,
and we were gonna troll the streets back and forth.
And we were gonna go to the Anvil,
like, at the usual time, it was 2:00 or 3:00 a.m.
But she never showed up.
And then, later, I remember...
I was down by the Stroll.
The girl stroll, the queen stroll, was on that left side.
On the right side was where all the boys used to do their thing.
The butch queens.
I remember the girls had put me on point.
"Miss Kitty, watch out.
There's a car full of guidos, you know, just driving around."
And later that evening, I heard that Marsha had gotten in the car.
The thing is... Yeah, we told her not to get in that car.
And I never saw her again after that, you know.
The police from the Sixth Precinct, they just brushed it off like...
like another one bites the dust type of thing, you know.
You know, it kind of makes me think, Victoria,
what happens when a flower gets wilted?
Does it just die away and it's forgotten?
[Victoria] Well, hopefully, that flower would have shed some seeds
-that will grow into a movement. -Right.
[Victoria] That's what I hope.
[reporter 1] Police are investigating a possible hate crime
that led to the death of a transgender woman.
[reporter 2] Twenty-one-year-old Islan Nettles was attacked on the street.
[reporter 3] Nettles was out with another transgender female, a friend.
[reporter 4] Police say the pair met a group of men who attacked them
once they realized Nettles and her friend weren't born as females.
[reporter 3] The friend tells investigators, when she ran away to get help,
the suspect was on top of Nettles, punching her in the face.
[reporter 5] Nettles was punched in the head, hit the ground.
She lapsed into a coma and later died.
[reporter 6] Twenty-year-old James Dixon faced a judge here at Manhattan Criminal Court.
He's charged with manslaughter and assault.
This person beat my baby with their bare hands to death.
And I don't feel he should walk in the streets
'cause my baby can't walk.
[Ted McGuire] He faces anything between 5 and 25 years.
The child was murdered in August of 2013.
And this has been going on, we're going on three years already.
The family's been in limbo.
This is a very important case. This place should be packed.
There should be people outside that couldn't get in the door.
We had the gay marriage. Everyone was out for gay marriage.
We used to march these streets up and down.
We got arrested over here. We handcuffed ourselves to that thing.
The privileged people, they got their gay marriage,
and now they're off... [mumbles] They're gone.
And they've left the transgender community behind.
What about the rest of the community? What about the T?
Remember the T? LGBT, you know?
As long as my people don't have their rights all across America,
there's no reason for celebration.
That's how come I've been walking for gay rights all these years.
And in 1973, they told me and Sylvia Rivera
that we get to lead the Gay Pride march,
the transvestites in the front of the parade.
Honey, they chickens put all of the drag queens
way in the back someplace.
Honey, that was not the right thing to do.
They don't care if you were there at the beginning of the gay movement,
demonstrating in drag with them.
They don't care.
[Karla] Transgender people felt that they were being pushed to the side.
That their place at Stonewall,
that their place from the beginning was being forgotten.
[Sylvia] I had been promised a spot to speak.
And they were having a conflict about the drag queens on stage.
Because we were supposed to be stereotypes.
But if it wasn't for a drag queen, there would be no gay liberation movement.
We're the frontliners.
I said, "Well, I'm gonna speak one way or the other."
[announcer] One person, a man, Sylvia gets up here, and--
Just a moment, just a moment. I would like to avoid any trouble.
This is a day of unity for us. I want us to be happy.
Sylvia!
Hi, baby!
You all better quiet down!
I've been trying to get up here all day
for your gay brothers and your gay sisters in jail!
They're writing me every motherfuckin' week,
and ask for your help!
And you all don't do a goddamn thing for them!
And they write STAR, not the women's group.
They do not write women. They do not write men.
They write STAR because we're trying to do something for them.
But you all tell me go and hide my tail between my legs.
I will not put up with this shit!
I have been beaten. I have had my nose broken.
I have been thrown in jail.
I have lost my job.
I have lost my apartment for gay liberation.
And you all treat me this way?
What the fuck's wrong with you all?
Think about that!
I believe in the gay power.
I believe in us getting our rights,
or else I would not be out there fighting for our rights.
That's all I wanted to say to your people.
Come and see your people at STAR House on 12th Street.
The people that are trying to do something for all of us,
and not men and women that belong to a white middle class club!
And that's what you all belong to!
Revolution now!
Gay... Gay power.
-Louder! Gay power! -[whistling]
I was hurt, and I felt that...
the movement had completely betrayed...
the drag queens and the street people.
And I felt that the years that I had already given them had been a waste.
So, I went home, locked up the house.
If it wasn't for Marsha, I wouldn't be here right now.
I got 60 stitches in this arm.
She came home and found me bleeding to death.
After the march of 1973...
I left the movement.
I found myself up in Westchester.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Music Hall in Tarrytown.
I want to give special thanks to everyone in the audience for still supporting us.
Of course, you get the first strange looks.
Ain't bothering me.
Next thing, you become friends with everybody.
I feel that I have liberated a lot of people
just by living here in the suburbs, just by being myself.
Just by being a campy queen.
And they appreciate. They really do.
That's how I was letting out most of my anger.
But I will not forgive the movement
for anything that they have done to my community.
-[Victoria] Give me a hug, girl. -[Rusty Mae Moore] A hug. I'm sorry.
[Victoria] Yes, girl. Oh, good to see you.
-Mmm! -[Rusty] Mmm. Nice hug.
-Yeah, I like to give good hugs. -[chuckles]
-Good hugs. -So, can I open this?
-Sure. -Thank you.
-You can light it up if you like, too. -Light it up?
Incense.
Chelsea, come here, girl. What's the matter with you?
-Give me a hug, baby. Blessed be. -Blessed be. How you doin'?
Anything you may be able to tell me may be very, very helpful.
I don't know anything that you can't get better from Randy Wicker.
Maybe you can tell me about the cops that were around during that time?
-I really can't. -You can't?
-No. -All right.
You went on an investigation in a white van with Randy. Remember that?
[Randy] Do you always smoke this much,
or is this just because you're a little nervous?
I always smoke this much when I'm down here, baby.
Honey, this is a fishing expedition. We'll either catch something or we won't.
We're just kind of trolling.
Let's start all over. [clears throat]
Randy wanted to talk about Marsha and how Marsha had died,
and how we suspected that she was murdered.
And could I make some highly irregular and very unofficial inquiries.
And I did, and I really didn't come up with anything. I wish I had.
[Randy] Where do you wanna go?
[Chelsea] I want to park the van. We're gonna go talk to the girls.
[Randy] Yeah.
You're gonna be out that back window with the camera.
[Randy] Close the door so the lights go off.
You know, I asked around the piers and in the neighborhood.
And asked around because I knew a lot of the girls
that were just walking around,
looking into matters on my own, or whatever.
[Randy] How long have you been involved in this?
[Chelsea] Twelve years.
You're on the street, with no place to go and no money.
Most of these girls are underage.
Most of them are more throwaways than runaways.
And the older ones are people like me that started out when we were young and...
-[Randy] You're a survivor, then. -Yes.
I'm practically the only one still alive from the girls I first started with.
[Randy] What happened to most of them?
Drug overdoses, suicides...
murdered by johns, murdered by pimps.
A lot of girls plain fucking disappear the way Marsha did.
[Chelsea] Marsha can't even be understood in 1992 without the context of...
Dead trannies were literally washing up on the street.
I mean, lying there dead, and...
no interest shown whatsoever in doing a damn thing about it.
You know more about this than I do.
[Victoria] Before the Anti-Violence Project, this is where I worked
from 1993 to 1996...
until I was sexually assaulted and physically assaulted
by nurses and aides in this building.
Right after this happened, I couldn't feel the ground beneath me.
And I would get up in the morning and just walk, walk and walk and walk.
It was like I was walking in a daze, but when...
I stopped there on Congress.
I had a knife in my pocket 'cause I wanted to hurt them.
What stopped me was that I was thinking about my mother,
and how would she feel if I went to jail. [sniffles]
It took me three days to get enough guts 'cause I was angry.
And I finally made the call to AVP.
And the person was so understanding and knew what I was going through.
I spoke with her for over two hours of what I was feeling. [sniffles]
The agency stood with me for a year
that I kept on going into court, back and forth,
case canceled, case postponed.
And I felt supported, so I just wanted to give back.
So, I volunteered for the Anti-Violence Project.
Fortunately for me, a space opened up at administrative assistant,
and from there I moved myself up to domestic violence counselor advocate.
I helped myself, my family and the community.
Was AVP involved with the investigation then?
-[Victoria] Of Marsha's case? -Yeah.
-Yes. -Okay, okay. Wow, okay.
-We've been around since 1980. -Yeah.
So, during that time, we were involved in the case,
and here's some of the flyers that AVP had given out.
That's Marsha. There's her death certificate.
We haven't got the toxicology report or any pictures, or anything like that.
That's what we're trying to get to see what condition the body was in,
and if it says that she had a hole in the head.
It sounds like a lot of people think it was a murder,
-or that she was pushed. -Yeah.
A lot of people think that it was foul play.
But they first said it was suicide.
Some people say she was giving things away,
-and flowers and some of her clothing. -Yeah.
I says, well, sometimes a person, when they're gonna commit suicide,
-they give their things away. -Yeah.
But then, at the same time, that's how she was all the time.
-She was always giving-- -She was always giving things away.
Somebody says, "I like your scarf." "Here, darling."
She'd give 'em the scarf, or she would go around giving flowers.
That's Marsha.
She had too much to live for, like she was looking forward to Gay Pride.
-She showed up at Pride... -Mmm-hmm.
...and was her old regal self, enjoyable self, and things like that.
-Just normal Marsha. -[Eddie] Yeah.
[man 1] Marsha!
-[man 2] Marsha! -[man 1] Marsha!
[Victoria] But the police, they didn't pay it any mind.
Something that they were accustomed to sweeping under the rug.
Things that still go on.
Nothing really has changed.
[protesters chanting] No justice, no peace!
[Frances Baugh] So what's going on with this case?
They're gonna get motions. They're getting set for motions.
Then they're gonna jury selection on Monday.
Okay, okay.
You know, he confessed already twice, to the detective and to the witness.
How much time do you think he's gonna get?
Who knows?
Back in the '70s, we went through all this crap.
But back then, it's just that you didn't hear about all these killings.
You didn't hear about it because now there's more media coverage.
Right. That's true, yeah.
I gotta text my honey. Sorry, I have some private business--
-[chuckles] Oh, my God. A honey. -I'm in love with him.
-You're in love with him? -Yes, I am.
-You'll be sorry. [chuckles] -Why? Why do you say that?
♪ Foolish little girl Fickle little girl ♪
So, this is what I am, huh?
♪ You didn't want him when he wanted you ♪
♪ And love is all we have for now ♪
[Coco Rodriguez] She tried to help through the AIDS epidemic.
If you were sick, she'd sit right by you.
She'd stop by and say, "Hey, are you okay? Do you need something?"
She was helping a person survive.
[Marsha] I always meet these young people
that don't have nobody who wants to stick by them and help them.
So I help them out with, like, a place to stay,
or some food to eat, or a little change for their pockets.
They don't call me "Pay It No Mind" Johnson for nothing.
[Coco] And you can't find another butterfly like that in life.
She always changed from her cocoon.
And you never knew what she was gonna wear.
You never knew what she was gonna wear.
Did you see this morning's treatment? Didn't you love that?
[Randy] What was this morning's treatment?
With the little hairdo and everything.
Did you see the fur coat I got her?
There she is, Miss America.
Well, tomorrow morning, I'll give you the breakfast treatment.
-I'm fixing breakfast for ya. -Yes, yes, yes.
-I'm gonna put on my Valentine outfit. -I love it.
-And you're gonna be-- -For breakfast?
Yes, you're gonna be gagging.
You'd be surprised how many gorgeous clothes
Randy got around here for me that I don't even wear.
Oh, the red velvet suit?
Yes, and all the furs.
We're gonna give you the treatment tomorrow morning,
just to get your heart ready for heart failure.
-["Alexis"] Are you taping all this? -[reporter] Yeah.
-["Alexis"] Right now? -[reporter] Right.
[Marsha] He's gonna try and write an article to try and help us.
[reporter] I'm trying to get some information
about what's going on on West Street,
with the police harassing everybody.
["Alexis"] In my whole time of having any dealings
with the Sixth Precinct Vice Squad,
these little creeps slapped me...
threatened to kill me,
told me right in the precinct, in front of everybody.
The one with the glasses, he says, "What are you, a girl or a boy?"
Next thing I knew, I was getting punched in my jaw.
["Chichi"] The first time, we was all on the corner,
and somebody had just said, "Run."
And they just started beating on me and kicking me in the chest.
[Marsha] They do that to a lot of people that run.
["Tina"] He pulled out his gun.
He said, "If you come back down here, I'm gonna shoot you."
Then the other cop said, "I oughta throw him in the water.
But he might be too skinny. He might not hit the bottom."
[Marsha] Yeah.
["Alexis"] They seem to believe that it is their job and duty
to extricate all transvestites, to torture transvestites.
[Victoria] How many trans murders did AVP record in 1992?
That summer was the worst summer ever.
We had many, many marches. We were demonstrating all the time,
because that was a way to get public and police attention.
But anti-LGBT violence was at a peak.
That year we had 1,300 reports of bias crime.
[Victoria] Some were from the police?
Yeah. If you look at the annual reports there,
you're gonna see, whatever, 12, 18% of those
were based on violence perpetrated by police.
Was this after or before Marsha's demise?
[Matt] It was going on before what happened to Marsha...
and it went on for a long time.
It's that whole period.
We were sick at heart
about this unrelenting wave of attacks,
particularly given the circumstances surrounding Marsha's death.
[Victoria] What was the community's relationship with the Sixth Precinct?
It was not positive because
it was not an adequate response from the police to all this violence.
It wasn't an adequate response from One Police Plaza
that went all the way down to the Sixth Precinct.
[Matt] They did not pay sufficient attention  to crimes like what happened to Marsha.
It was obvious that she had been murdered,
and it was obvious that the police weren’t giving it the attention that it deserved.
I mean, I don't have any peace at home anymore, doll.
My roommate Randy's really after the people from the Festival Committee.
-Tommy, thank you. -[Tommy] You're welcome.
I mean, he's doing this whole great big trip with all these organizations
to change all these people around lately.
Which can get you murdered, you know.
Honey, and wait until they get ahold of you for taking their money away.
Randy tried to put me in the middle of it.
I tell him I don't bite my tongue for nobody.
I tell him I don’t want to be bothered.
So, honey, we're wondering when the Mob is gonna come with the bullets. [laughs]
[interviewer] I understand you.
[Marsha] And when the Mob comes, darling, they say,
"Why are you giving out these flyers? What do you got against us?"
"Oh, I don’t have anything against youse.
It's just that my roommate suspects...
[chuckles] that youse have been racketeering and stuff."
[Randy] Hi, my name is Randy Wicker.
I have started the campaign
to expose and replace the Christopher Street Festival Committee.
I'm tired of shady operators running
the Christopher Street Festival on Gay Pride Day.
Where do all those festival dollars go?
The Christopher Street Festival Committee is widely rumored to be Mob-controlled.
We're gonna take this festival back, run it for our community.
Take back the day.
[Victoria] Remember this event here, Take Back the Day?
Where Randy was trying to take back
the Christopher Street Festival from the Mob?
I remember he had signs about it. It was a...
concern with him. I don't remember a particular day.
Who was running the Christopher Street Festival
during that time that you remember?
If you take charge and make a logical decision, people will follow.
Heritage of Pride would organize the annual march, rally and dance.
And we'd march downtown along Fifth Avenue, into the Village.
In the Village, there was the annual Christopher Street Liberation Festival,
which was basically booths and meat on a stick,
and your standard street festival.
The guys who ran the festival were Ed Murphy,
who had been a bouncer at the Stonewall, and his friend Red Mahoney.
And Red Mahoney was his...
you know, um...
assistant.
They worked for whatever part of the Mafia ran the gay bars at the time.
They did their thing and we did ours, and--
The reason I'm bringing this up is because
Marsha would go around saying the Mob was after her.
-That's why I'm asking these questions. -I can see getting that upset.
But the gay bar business wasn't gonna be
where you put your folks who could shoot well,
and it wasn't where you put folks who could run the business.
It was what you did with the idiot nephew who wasn't capable of being a mobster.
He was capable of showing up and getting whatever percentage at the door he got,
and selling overpriced toilet paper.
[Victoria] Well, Randy Wicker hired Sam Ciccone
to do an investigation,
and there was some guy named Jacques Garon.
[reporter] A couple of the accusations being made about the Festival Committee
is that it's backed by some of the Mob.
Two, you're making a lot of money and profit off this thing
and nothing goes back to the gay community.
The first thing is about the Mob connection.
That rumor has been going on for centuries.
I've been in the committee for seven years
and I've never seen any Mob connection,
'cause I wouldn't be involved if that would be the case.
Number two, as far as making a lot of money? God, I wish.
The only money that we get
The only money that we get is through the sale of the booths on Christopher Street on Friday.
is through the sale of the booths on Christopher Street on Friday.
And what happens with that money?
That money is given back in many ways.
We help a lot of people throughout the year.
We don't make a big issue out of it because we don't want to.
[Randy] It's outrageous that these kind of people, Jacques Garon and Red Mahoney,
are running our particular event.
I say that we're gonna take this festival back.
We'll run it for our community.
We have nothing to fear but fear itself.
This is Randy Wicker saying keep the faith.
[Candida] Randy was good at antagonizing people.
But why stop at knocking off Marsha? Why not punish Randy?
-[Eddie] Okay. -[Victoria] All right.
[Victoria] Here we go. Here we are again.
-Number seven. -Call log, that's what you're looking for?
[Victoria] Yeah, call logs. To see if there's anything we've missed.
Maybe it's one of those two boxes there. Shit, wouldn’t you know it.
What's this here?
-[Eddie] Ms. Vicky, do you need help? -[Victoria] Nah.
[man] Look, Ms. Vicky.
[Victoria] Wait a minute.
Here it is.
-Found it? -Yeah.
Okay.
"Received a call. Do you know Randy Wicker?
Tell Randy Wicker to leave Jacques Garon, Red Mahoney and...
did not get name... alone,
or what happened to Marsha Johnson will happen to him."
Shit.
It was a very chilling phone call,
particularly given the circumstances surrounding Marsha's death
and everything that was going on with the Festival Committee.
And then... I don't know if this happened the same day.
You received a call from a Rodger McFarlane
and he said he remembered seeing Marsha
on the fifth at 4:00 a.m. in the morning on 22nd Street.
He said that Marsha was kind of terrified
and was being followed by two guys going west to the river.
-Was that reported to the police? -That was reported to the police.
'Cause that determines someone saw Marsha on the fifth,
and her body was found on the sixth.
We made that statement publicly known.
It was up to the police to follow up on it.
Right. Then that would tie in about Randy taking on the Mob,
the call that you got of Marsha being followed and her death.
Well, those pieces certainly fit together.
There's all these pieces here
that point to exactly what we were saying back then, that...
Marsha did not die by suicide.
In any other community,
had a similar hero been found dead
under unclear circumstances,
it seems self-evident that the city would have put real resources behind it
to try to figure out what happened.
[Litwin] Cold Case Squad, Detective Litwin. Can I help you?
Yes, good afternoon, Detective Litwin. It's Victoria Cruz.
-Hi, how are you? -Very well, thank you.
-And yourself? -Very good, thank you.
Okay, I know that you had spoken to a couple of retired detectives,
and they called me because I investigated this case about two years ago.
And I'm not gonna say she committed suicide,
but there's no credible evidence that she was murdered. None.
[Victoria] Let me ask you a question.
Did the police ever record the threats made to Randy Wicker?
That's never come up at all. I don't have any record of that.
So I can't really say anything on that.
Did AVP ever pass that on to the police department?
They said they did.
And what about the sighting of Marsha
on the fifth at 4:00 a.m. in the morning on 22nd Street?
She was kind of frightened because there were two men following her
as she was rushing down towards the Hudson River.
Do you know if the police ever recorded two males following her?
-I see no record of that in the case. -You see no record?
No, there was never anything conveyed to the police
about her being seen on the fifth and being followed.
So, that's new to me.
-So how you been? -Pretty good.
Okay, listen.
I have a couple of questions to ask you because all the, um...
-All that we've been finding out... -Right.
...points to the Mob.
Okay.
What do you know about that?
So, Marsha...
apparently had a fear about the Mob or the Mafia.
-And I don't-- -Because?
Because I was investigating the Christopher Street Festival Committee.
Have you and Marsha ever had a conversation about this subject?
Of you taking on the Christopher Street Festival and the Mob?
Maybe that's why she didn't wanna go home. She thought she was in danger.
She probably raised the issue with me about what I was doing.
I don't remember that.
But if she had, I would've laughed at it,
because to me it was just a political fight.
I don't think of political fights as being heavy duty,
where they murder your roommate because they don't like what you're doing.
Heritage of Pride tried to get control of the Festival a couple years before I did,
and they were threatened.
-By whom? -By the Mob.
They told me, "Randy, don't do this. We tried to do it and we were threatened."
And I said, "Well, I'm gonna do it."
Well, on July 28th, they've made a threat to you.
Here.
At 5:55 on the 28th, just five minutes before AVP closes,
my informant gets this call. "Do you know Randy Wicker?"
Matt said, "Yes." Then he said,
"Tell Randy to leave Jacques Garon, Red Mahoney,"
and another person who did not get named,
"alone or what happened to Marsha Johnson will happen to him."
And the person hung up.
Oh, God.
I am sure that he did not tell me that. I'm willing to bet you now--
So, you were never threatened when you took them on?
No. I never... Who would forget that?
When people would tell me things about the Mob and whatever,
I was the one that just...
Don't go there, you know. I was actually...
I look at it now, I realize I was really in heavy denial.
That might've been why she ended up staying out,
and why staying out, she winded...
Instead of being home and safe in Hoboken, you know, with me,
and the dog, you know, and our family.
Could I say you're blaming yourself for it?
Yeah, I think that... I mean, it really bothers me.
I mean, I didn't know that.
[Sylvia] This is a beautiful turnout.
And she's gonna be so proud.
And remember that the last name... The middle name is Marsha P. Johnson,
and the P stands for "Pay It No Mind" Johnson!
Thank you all. Thank you so much. Marsha thanks you all.
-[man 1] Yeah, Randy! -[man 2] Thank you, Randy.
-[man 3] Bravo, Marsha! -Bravo, Marsha!
[interviewer] How long have you lived here?
I've been here since a week before Gay Pride Day this year.
This is my little house.
When I got that telegram that Marsha was dead...
part of me went with her
because one of our pacts was that we would always cross River Jordan together.
And to me, this is the River Jordan. The Hudson River.
And that's when I started reaching for the bottle
more heavily than I was doing.
After Marsha's death...
I came back to New York City.
We are your history!
She's not here, but she's here in spirit, Marsha P. Johnson.
-She's always-- -[woman] Yeah. She'll always be with me.
Always.
She'll always be in the front of this parade.
Let's put Marsh there.
Can't forget Marsh.
[Henry over phone] Records, Ms. Henry.
Hi, good afternoon, Ms. Henry. My name is Victoria.
I sent an inquiry in reference to getting, um,
the medical examiner's records from a case back in '92,
and I was just wondering if you've received it.
Okay, Victoria, I'm getting ready to send you a letter
to say that, as of now, our office can't locate this case file.
-You can't locate the case file? -That's right.
Any particular reason that it's not locatable?
I don't know. It's not in archives and it's not in the container.
That's kind of strange.
These things do happen every now and again.
Did some other department check that out or your department did?
It's my department only that has custody of those case files.
And... [sighs]
And then in all your 1992 cases, the only file that's missing is that one?
I wouldn't say that.
I've never said that, and I will never say that.
-You searched personally? -Yes. Correct.
And who can I speak to more or less to get something really done on this case?
I don't know who to tell you.
We're here today to support justice for Islan Nettles.
Today will be the start to the trial at 9:30.
We're hoping that the outcome of the trial, whenever trial ends,
is gonna be the maximum sentence for James Dixon,
the person accused of killing Islan Nettles.
That maximum sentence is 25 years,
and that's what we're asking the DA to ask the judge for.
[reporter] You've been following Marsha's case.
So what has, like, this case... Has it helped to bring some light
to past cases of violence against transgender people?
[Victoria] No. On the contrary.
Just as most cases that come up against trans women,
they plead the panic defense,
or they just think they can brush it under the rug,
and people will pay no mind to it.
Can you actually speak a little bit more to this panic defense?
The panic defense? Well, they didn't know she was a trans woman.
There was a case back in '97, Fitzgerald case.
Picked up this person in a gay bar, male gay bar,
and took them home.
In court, he didn't know she was a trans woman.
The person was stabbed multiple times, and he got off.
Pleaded panic defense. Just like now, in the Nettles case.
He claimed he panicked. That's his defense.
[news anchor] The West Side Highway is due for a fix-up.  It's been a long time coming.
There are concerns about uprooting some people there.
The homeless will be asked to move tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.
The plans call for the Hudson River Boulevard,
trees, traffic for seven lanes and paths for bikers, joggers and skaters.
The homeless will have to pack up their few possessions and get out.
There's a sense of anger and desperation here
for about 30 homeless people who call Pier 54 their home.
What about going to a shelter, or getting some of the services that are available?
Is that not an option for you?
The city shelters are not safe.
-Do you feel like it's safer here? -Yes.
It's called a sweep. Not even a fucking eviction.
A sweep. Like we're trash.
There's so many fucking buildings in this fucking Manhattan,
and they can't give up a fucking building to fucking...
maybe 15 people that will go in and try to re-renovate it?
Marsha and I did it back in the '70s on our own.
Yeah, I'm crazy, because the world has made me crazy.
Don't be going in my house!
Excuse me, don't be going in my house!
Well, Marsha, we tried. That's all I can say.
-[Victoria] Hi, Ms. Henry. -[Henry] A package was mailed out to you.
[Victoria] Okay, so you mailed us the autopsy report.
[Henry] I mailed you whatever I was able to put together, okay?
[Victoria] So, we'll be receiving it in the near future?
-[Henry] Yes. -[Victoria] Okay.
Thank you. You've been most helpful.
-Hi, Eddie. Come on in. -Hi.
-Did you bring the report? -Yeah.
Okay, Ms. Henry said it was only partial. Is it a big envelope?
It's kind of heavy.
This looks flimsy.
"Office of the Medical Examiner, City of New York,
have performed an autopsy on the body of Malcolm Michaels
on the 7th day of July, 1992, at 1:30 p.m."
But they classified it as drowning at first,
but then they circled "possible homicide." Like, here.
It looks like they found a lot of discoloration,
but no evidence of trauma.
-Does that sound right? -No trauma on the skull. Yeah.
"There is a sub... Uh..."
I don't know what the fuck this word is.
Maybe we should look at another examiner's look at them.
-Or get... Right, get somebody-- -Have a professional look at this autopsy.
-Dr. Kildare. -Doctor... Who's that?
[chuckles] He was before your time.
"Images of photos on CD."
Okay. [sighs]
Oh, God. [clicks tongue]
[Dr. Michael Baden] What we have here is an unwitnessed drowning.
She went into the water while still alive and breathing.
It wasn't a situation where death occurred someplace else,
by whatever means...
and then put in the water.
Whether she's pushed in,
whether she's being chased and falls accidentally,
we can't tell from the autopsy. That depends on the police investigation.
Could you rule out a violent assault?
Yes, there's no evidence there of violent assault.
There was no injury, no impact injury, to any part of her body.
There was no fracture of the skull, there was no damage to the brain at all.
[Victoria] What about the hole in the head?
Well, the body gets injured after death...
-Okay. -...by floating debris and all that.
And the body starts breaking apart faster in warmer water.
So what looks like a gash on the left side,
-is really just the peeling of skin. -Okay.
But it's just normal separation of skin.
[Al] I don't think it was a suicide.
It could've been an accident. It could've...
They said the pier was dilapidated.
He could've stepped through a hole in the pier.
Or people could have been following him,
and because there was no evidence of any type of trauma to the body,
that don't mean they beat him up and threw him in the water.
They could've chased him, scared him, and he also fell through the pier.
[Dr. Michael] Yes, that certainly brings up the issue of homicide,
because if somebody's being chased...
and runs in front of a car,
or accidentally falls into the water, runs into the water,
that would be called a homicide.
Well, we have documentation where she was frantic, being followed.
Credible person giving this report to our agency,
and then wasn't even investigated.
[Dr. Michael] Well, there's no, um...
statute of limitation on homicide, and that goes beyond my pay grade.
[Victoria] Something's wrong.
We keep on running into a brick wall whenever we deal with the city.
Every time I spoke to a cop, and they just brushed me off.
Something's wrong.
Every time I made a call, "You have to do this and this and this."
Something's wrong.
Why this particular case?
I think maybe we should go up one step higher,
and maybe seek some assistance from someplace outside of New York City
to just look over what we have here.
You know, it's obvious that the police are not cooperating with this.
Well, we don't have an endless pot
of people or time or resources.
And so, I'm not really sure what is involved in that.
You know, just today, you all were at the trial for Islan Nettles.
I mean, there are so many cases,
and so many have not had any resolution.
We've had, in the last couple of months, a number of murders across the country.
When trans lives are under attack, what do we do?
[protester] Stand up, fight back.
[reporter 1] Eight transgender women across the country have been murdered in the last 34 days.
There have been more than 400 people murdered in the past decade.
[reporter 2] Transgender women face the most severe violence
within the LGBTQ community.
A transgender woman was found strangled to death.
Police say she was stabbed several times.
[reporter 3] In street lingo, it was a curb stomp. He was dressed as a woman.
[Jennifer] And shame on the media for calling us men dressed in women's clothing.
Shame on the media for that.
This cannot go unanswered. I say, hands off my sister.
Do we not deal with the immediate needs there
to go back and spend the time to investigate this case?
Or even, like, what does that mean?
[Victoria] What does that mean? Justice for Marsha.
[protesters chanting] Keep your hands off my sister! Keep your hands off my sister!
Keep your hands off my sister! [Victoria] And justice for so many others.
The visibility that we can do something about a case that's been cold,
and then seeking justice,
if not for the family, but for the community.
-I know-- -Because this is part of our history.
It is part of our history. I completely believe that.
And I'm also worried about the future.
[protesters chanting] Keep your hands off my sister!
Keep your hands off my sister! Keep your hands off my sister!
Keep your hands off my sister! Keep your hands off my sister!
Whatever happened, it must have been around here.
We live as who we are. This is us. This is us being at home.
I don't know, we just want to be ourselves.
The women we are, inside-out.
Right? Am I wrong?
-[Rusty] She's right. Very wise of her. -[giggles]
It started out, it was just Chelsea and me.
It started out, it was just Chelsea and me. And, um, then, people just started to come.
And, um, then, people just started to come.
We started to think of ourselves as,
you know, this was the house that Sylvia and Marsha had.
And we really looked at STAR House as our reference point.
[Rusty] Aw, there they are. I have to get this picture.
She'd been homeless, and she'd been living on a pier, and that sort of thing.
She'd been homeless, and she'd been living on a pier, and that sort of thing. And I said, "Hey, you're not homeless. I got a place.
And I said, "Hey, you're not homeless. I got a place.
Long as I got a place, you're not homeless."
She didn't move in right away, but she started coming around.
She'd do some work in the backyard, do some work around the house
in lieu of paying rent.
...went around the streets.
We have to help one another. We really do. It's important.
The people in the house really related to Sylvia.
She mothered them, in a way, and gave advice.
She talked with them.
But when she sobered up, then she was much better with them.
Just like cold turkey. Bang, no more drinking.
We have to remember, we must continue to fight this government
because this government is the one
that's going to keep us divided at all time.
[Rusty] That's when she got back into her role, I think,
as an activist in the community.
And all of a sudden, we noticed people were coming up and saying,
"You're Sylvia Rivera, aren't you? I thought you was dead!"
I began to realize that
she really had a lot of projection in the community.
[in French] It's a huge party, and its mission is to fight against discrimination.
[news anchor] In the streets of Rome,
World Gay Pride gathered 200,000 gays, transgender people and lesbians
from Italy, as well as America, France and Germany.
It really gives me great pleasure to be here in representation
of the gay liberation movement and the transgender movement
all the way from the United States.
I didn't think 31 years ago that I would have so many children,
but I'm proud to have liberated you.
Viva and love Pride,
and continue your struggle all around the world!
[Sylvia] The crowd went crazy.
At one point in between my speech,
they started calling me a living myth in Italian.
Mistica. Mistica.
Oh, my God, it's hard.
Then people were coming up and kissing my hand,
and then giving me the double kiss,
and going through the whole scenario
with the little bit of English that they knew.
"Thank you for what you did at Stonewall."
I was really emotional about the whole thing.
-Guess what? -[Rusty] What?
Guess where Mother has keys to now, then?
To the church.
-[Rusty] To the church? -Mother got a job at church.
[Rusty] What are you doing?
-[Sylvia] Bagging up food and whatnot. -And are they paying you?
-[Sylvia] Yes. -[Rusty] No kidding.
I can go home and say that I've actually tried to make a difference.
[Rusty] That's what marriage does to you.
-She's made me an honest woman. -[Rusty] Really? That's good.
I mean, me of all people, Sylvia Rivera, had the keys to a church.
[news anchor] Sylvia Rivera was 50 years old when she died of liver cancer last week.
Virtually up until the moment she died, she was lobbying for legislation
to protect the rights of this most despised of minorities.
[all chanting] Trans rights now! Trans rights now!
Doubtless, there will be many stories told about Sylvia.
Some true, some pure myth.
That happens with great leaders.
And make no mistake tonight,
Sylvia Rivera is the mother of our movement,
-a great leader of our people. -[audience applauding]
[Xena Grandichell] I'm tired of people assaulting and murdering trans women.
I want it changed, and it's gonna change.
'Cause we're gonna keep pushing the issue until it does.
Nobody's prosecuting these people properly.
They don't get what any other murderer would get.
They get a pat on the wrist and a little bit of time and let go.
This judge and DA have to do the right thing.
Prosecute him like you would a regular person.
[judge] As everyone is aware, we're here today for sentencing.
First, the People are gonna be reading, I understand, a statement.
[prosecutor] I'm going to be reading a statement that was sent to me
by the biological father of Islan Nettles.
He had asked me personally to read this on his behalf.
"There was a very outgoing, free-spirited, young, promising individual
that had a very bright future,
that had the potential to make a mark in the world.
And it came to a screeching halt
by an individual that was upset because he was clowned by his friends,
because he didn't know the women he was trying to holler at
was actually a transgender woman.
He made a conscious decision to beat a transgender woman to death
because of who she was
and the embarrassment he felt he had suffered.
I was extremely proud of the person she became.
But no matter what amount of time this man gets,
it will never fill the hole in my heart
that a person that had such a magnificent future
and was my only child and a lifelong gift had once filled."
[judge] Mr. Dixon, I hereby sentence you to a determinate sentence of imprisonment
with a term of 12 years.
All right, we're adjourned.
[woman] You're crushing us. You're killing us.
This young man is only going to end up doing ten and a half years,
learn nothing, come back out and do this again.
This needs to stop.
We're not letting none of this go anymore.
[Marsha] Really, everybody goes sooner or later.
Tomorrow's not promised to anyone.
I learned that in church when I was five years old.
And I've never forgotten it.
So, uh, every day counts. [chuckles]
to never again bear arms against him or his... heirs.
So help me God.
[Edward] Stay there.
Sir Robert, your father is an old and valued friend,
a great warrior who saved my life in the Holy Land.
You fought well for eight years, but not always on the right side.
I welcome your renewed fealty, and accept your submission.
-Is that all? -[man] Yes, Sire.
Good.
My lords of Scotland, today you have each pledged fealty to me
as your rightful overlord.
Any lands confiscated during this conflict will now be returned to you.
-See? That wasn't so bad. -[Edward] I hope you see the futility
-See? That wasn't so bad. -[Edward] I hope you see the futility of your years of opposition, and accept responsibility
of your years of opposition, and accept responsibility for the bloodshed that could have been avoided.
Lord John Comyn, Lord Robert Bruce...
[man] Step forward.
[Edward] I understand both your families have a strong claim on the Scottish crown.
However, neither can be favored. Therefore,
However, neither can be favored. Therefore, England will continue to govern your province and receive its due in taxes.
England will continue to govern your province and receive its due in taxes.
-Our viceroy, Sir Aymer de Valence... -Sire.
[Edward] ...will lead a new council of Scottish administration.
You both will be proud to serve under him,
and you will take that opportunity,
if you are wise, to heal the differences between you.
Offer your hands.
Now let us be what we once were...
-friends! -[noblemen cheering]
Music! Drink! Feast!
-[Edward] Rob! -[Bruce Senior] Your Majesty...
a memorable day, Sire.
[man] Robert!
That must have been painful for you.
[chuckles] I'm sure I've had worse, Your Highness.
Do you remember our summers at Westminster, when I was a little boy?
Our footraces, dueling with wooden swords.
You were always so good at everything.
That was just because I was older than you.
What would you say to a duel right now?
Like old times?
-And break my oath already? -[chuckles]
The order was to come unarmed, Your Highness. Quiet.
Let's say five pounds to whomever wins leverage.
Let's make it ten.
I heard you'd developed a taste for wagering.
Piers, fetch him a sword.
[Prince of Wales] It's unfortunate you had some sentimental notion of fighting for the people. It's understandable.
of fighting for the people. It's understandable.
-[man] Not a good start, Bruce. -[man] Watch yourself, brother.
[Prince of Wales] Endearing, even.
I just wanted to win.
So...
William Wallace...
the last rebel standing.
-[both laughing] -[man] Well done!
-[under his breath] Prick. -How much have you had to drink?
Not nearly enough.
[man] Keep the head, Robert.
They say he lives in Selkirk Forest.
Some consider him a martyr...
others, a madman.
What do you think?
[breathing heavily] I think he is a man
who loves his country more than his life.
[Prince of Wales] Diplomatically put.
-[Robert sighing wearily] -All right, fortunately,
you Scottish nobles don’t share that passion.
-[Robert coughs] -Or we’d have to kill you all.
[man] James Douglas, stop!
[man] Your Majesty!
[mimics] "Your Majesty!" What is it?
[mimics] "Your Majesty!" What is it? [man] Your father, he wishes to see you at once.
[man] Your father, he wishes to see you at once.
[Prince of Wales] Shut up, you sniveling fool!
-[man] You're late. -[man] You know how much this means to me.
Please, for once use your brain. Stay there.
-Thank you, Bishop. -I'll see what I can do.
You're the one who was up all night, clutching your chamber pot!
What the hell are you doing?
You have responsibilities. We've had petitioners.
Sit down!
When are you gonna grow up?
Robert insisted we wager on swords. And I have grown up.
You just don’t like me very much.
Pardon me, Sire.
There is one last petitioner.
James Douglas.
[Edward] Douglas?
Your Majesty, I am the son of Sir William Douglas,
who died a prisoner in the Tower of London. Your father was a treacherous rebel.
Our lands were seized and gifted to Sir Richard de Clifford.
Our lands were seized and gifted to Sir Richard de Clifford. -Traitors forfeit their lands. -That land, Sire, is my birthright.
-Traitors forfeit their lands. -That land, Sire, is my birthright.
-You heard my father. Get out. -You have balls, I'll give you that.
Get out of here,
before I have them removed.
Royal decree: I never want to hear the name Douglas again.
I know this young man. I baptized him.
Pardon me, Sire, for his insolence. Go!
-Do not push your luck today! -[James] He can't do that! He slandered my name.
[Edward] That's how you pass a camel through the eye of a needle.
Sire, ready.
Good.
Come! Rob, I have something to show you.
Friends, join us.
We have a spectacle.
Has there not been enough humiliation?
Lord Oliphant tried to surrender two days ago.
Edward refused to accept.
Wants to be certain we get the message.
[Edward] Robert.
Everyone needs to understand that this surrender is final.
Light the Greek fire.
Also, it took three months to build, so I don't want to waste it.
[raised voice] My lords...
and ladies...
I give you...
the War Wolf.
Now you can accept the surrender.
[Valence] Yes, Sire.
Congratulations, my lords. Today, you're on the winning side.
I'm proud of you, Robert.
You had the courage to stand up to me,
and the wisdom to stand down.
Well done for bringing your son round, Rob.
Sir Roger de Mowbray, fierce steward of the north,
vanquisher of Stirling! Our thanks!
-Finally, Sir Richard de Burgh, -[crowd cheering]
valiant marshal, loyal servant of the Crown.
[Richard de Burgh] Your Grace.
We give the hand of your daughter, Elizabeth, my god-daughter, to Sir Robert de Brus.
my god-daughter, to Sir Robert de Brus.
And may this pairing symbolize the harmonious union of our two countries.
[Edward] The fathers may kiss.
You’ve mourned her long enough, Robert.
Edward’s intentions were well-meant.
The important thing is we are favored.
This council with Valence...
is a mere formality.
Edward will offer us the crown.
He all but promised me.
You’d be a lackey.
Yes...
if it meant me being king.
And after me, you.
King Robert.
[man] Sadly, the choice was to submit or be hounded to death. It's that simple.
-And you trust Edward's peace, Angus? -I didn't say I trusted him.
What is peace with a sword to the throat? I say we fight--
We swore an oath, Alexander, to God.
If we break it, we'll have no honor left.
[Alexander] So we do nothing, Euan? And live like cowards?
-That's not what I meant-- -[yelling] Enough!
Father...
made the decision.
It is ours to bear.
[Richard de Burgh] His family has vast lands north and south to the border.
You could do a lot worse.
What happened to his first wife?
She died giving birth to his daughter.
Do I have to call her Mother?
No.
I wonder if she’ll like Jessie.
[Robert chuckles] Well, she’d better!
Are you ready?
I hear this one's got two legs for a change.
-Heard she smells like Jessie, too. -Quiet!
Hairy old thing.
-[Prince of Wales] Robert. -Your Highness.
My father sends his best.
And you know Bishop Lamberton, of course.
-Bishop. -Congratulations, Lord Bruce.
My lord.
[Richard de Burgh] My lord, my daughter Elizabeth.
My lady.
My lord.
Welcome.
And you must be Marjorie?
-[dog whines softly] -And who’s this handsome fellow?
Our dog, Jessie, my lady.
Call me Elizabeth.
-Elizabeth? -Mm-hmm.
My lord, your new estates in Ireland,
from which you will now gather rents.
Most kind, my lord.
-What do you think you're doing? -Lord Bruce bid us celebrate in here.
Get back in the kitchen.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Trying to.
Are you?
I'm...
appreciating your honesty.
My lord.
It's about time to retire to your bedchamber.
Please, follow me.
Yes, that's it, Bruce! Off to bed!
Time to rut! [laughing]
Amen.
-[Robert] Amen. -[Elizabeth] Amen.
Was this her room?
Yes.
Thank you for enduring what you had to tonight.
I'm sure it was difficult.
Sleep well.
That was... quick.
[sighs] Aye, well, you'd know plenty about that, Seamus.
[Robert] What song is that?
"Bonny at Morn."
That's pretty.
Thank you.
-This way, please. -My lord,
you promised our taxes would be reduced once the wars with Edward were over.
Aye, I know, Iain.
Sadly, we're still paying Edward compensation for the rebellion.
Aye.
-How are you? -My lady.
[man] Livestock over there, by the horses. Everything else over here.
All baskets over that side.
-[man] Get out the way! -[man] In the name of the King!
[man] Move aside there!
-[man] Move yourselves! -I'll handle this, Father.
[man] Round them up! Yes! Come on!
It is our feudal duty to provide fighting men for our overlord, King Edward.
You assured us these obligations would be over!
-I'd hoped they were. -[woman] He’s not yet 14!
[woman] Bastards!
Stop!
My father is Richard de Burgh, a senior marshal in your army.
My father is Richard de Burgh, a senior marshal in your army. I presume you have heard of him?
I know for a fact he prefers to command men, not children.
Let him go.
Let him go.
[man] Do it. We have enough.
What you did today was...
brave.
Anything else?
No.
Good night, then.
Good--
[woman] Marjorie!
[man] I'll see Lord Valence gets these conscription papers straight away, my lord.
Did I ever tell you of the time, Robert, when I...
went to the Holy Land to fight?
I bought a small monkey on a chain.
-Moses, we christened him. [laughs] -[Robert laughs]
All the hours me and King Edward spent training Moses...
In the end, he could ride a horse.
He could even fire a tiny bow and arrow
that Edward himself had fashioned. [laughs]
Aye.
Edward...
was my friend, Robert.
He was my brother in arms.
But I fear I've made a...
a grave mistake in trusting him.
Father?
Father?
Robert, you just buried your father.
I’m still obliged to pay my taxes to our king.
Fresh pies!
-Would you like a pie, sir? -[Angus] What do you have, my dear?
[woman] We have game pie, sir.
Bless you.
Clear the way!
This yours, little fellow? Eh? Did you lose something?
-Taxes from Carrick. -[man] Thank you, Lord Bruce.
[Alexander] What's happened?
[man] Wallace! William Wallace!
-[girl screams] No! -Bastards!
-Go home! -[man] Soldiers! Form a line!
-Disperse by order of the King! -[woman] You murderers!
-[woman] You murdering bastards! -[Angus] They've killed Wallace.
[man] Get back!
-[soldier yelling] Move back! -[man] Bastards!
Make way in the name of the King!
Move! [soldier] Get back, you bastards!
Move!
[soldier yelling] Get back!
[woman] You bastards!
-[Angus] Get back, Robert! -[man] Robert!
-[soldier] Beat them back! -[soldier] Disperse!
Get back!
Bastards!
[man] You can't do this!
This is for Wallace!
We have to do something here!
They're too strong. [man] There's too many!
[man] Wallace!
[man] We have to do something! Robert, we have to fight back!
[Angus] Now is not the time. Robert!
-[man] Wallace! -[man] Come on! Robert!
[Angus] Let's go!
-More wine, my lord? -Thank you, Seamus.
Elizabeth, I have to speak to my brothers.
That's fine. I can hear what you have to say.
Alone.
Seamus, Gayle, Drew.
[Seamus] My Lord.
Good night.
We swore vows on King Edward’s Bible...
that we will need to break.
-Why? What happened? -Wallace is dead.
The people are up in arms.
There can be no peace.
What would Father say?
Father is gone. This is my decision.
But you are my blood.
My family.
I cannot do this without you.
We need to raise an army.
It's crucial we get as many Lords on our side as possible,
including John Comyn.
[Robert] I'm sorry if I was rude earlier, but I--
I know you have no need for my counsel.
It’s true, I have seen very little of the world.
However, a young lady of my standing is afforded a great deal of time to read,
to form distinct opinions, and...
to draw her own conclusions about the nature of power.
-All right. -Power is making decisions.
Power is not allowing yourself to be buffeted on the tides of history.
Instead, it is choosing a boat, climbing aboard, and hoisting the sail.
I choose you.
And whatever course you are charting,
I choose you.
My husband.
Good night.
Good night.
I don't like it.
We can't trust Comyn.
[man] It's sacred ground, Angus.
[Angus] I still don't like it.
[man] Well, he insisted.
I confess, I was surprised to receive your letter.
“I do urgently desire to discuss with you a matter most delicate.”
It's a bit cryptic, wouldn’t you say?
It was intentional.
I see.
And if I were to infer that your aim was in fact to reignite a rebellion...
We already tried it.
For eight bloody years. And we failed.
Because we didn’t unite.
No, because your family
were too busy trying to claim a crown that wasn’t theirs.
Are you saying you wish to relinquish that claim?
I’m saying we need to set aside our rivalry and win back our country.
Then we can decide who wears the crown. Us.
Not Edward.
John, between us, we could raise 20,000 men.
-We could have a fighting chance. -It’ll never work.
The people are tired of war and suffering.
Wallace was tortured and slaughtered. The people aren't tired,
they are desperate for justice.
Wallace got what he deserved.
He wasn’t a man, he was an idea.
A destructive and dangerous idea.
Almost as dangerous as the idea you’re proposing.
You Bruces are all the same.
-John-- -You’re not worthy of our country.
And I swear I’ll do whatever it takes to keep you from being its king.
And once I explain to Edward the meaning of your furtive letter to me,
he’ll place a noose over your head...
and Scotland’s crown upon mine.
[Angus] He was going to betray you. You had no other choice, Robert.
We have to tell Lamberton. I'm a damned man now.
[Lamberton] With Robert, at least we stand a chance.
[man] He needs to be excommunicated, as the Pope will surely demand.
[Lamberton] Where would that leave us?
If we disown him now, we remain at the mercy of Edward.
The survival of the Scottish church is at stake.
No one is arguing that, but you are asking us
to support a murderer.
The answer is clear, is it not?
[bishop] You will confess.
And I will absolve you for the murder of John Comyn.
If you vow to support the Church,
we will support your inauguration as our king.
It must be done quickly. In Scone.
Scone may be dangerous.
It’s next to the English garrison at Perth.
For the people, it must be Scone. We need legitimacy,
particularly now.
Scone it is.
[yelling] I am so sick of Scotland!
Slaying his rival on sacred ground. It’s lunacy!
I knew he detested John Comyn, but I never thought he'd go this far.
He'll have himself crowned king before the Pope can excommunicate him.
King? Robert? You think he would dare?
Yes.
[Prince of Wales] Put me in charge of this.
I know you think me incompetent, Father,
-but I am to be king... -[Edward] Hm.
...one day. Let this be a test.
...one day. Let this be a test. What would you do, son?
I would raise the dragon, Father.
Get word to Valence.
Robert the Bruce to be declared an outlaw.
Any man or woman who would give shelter to him or any of his ranks
to be executed without trial.
My son will raise the dragon banner.
The codes of chivalry are ended. There will be no quarter.
Your recklessness is going to get us all killed!
-Not if we stand side by side. -The bishops absolved him.
-Not if we stand side by side. -The bishops absolved him. -Surely you can do the same. -It’s not as simple as that.
-Surely you can do the same. -It’s not as simple as that.
-Why is it not as simple as that? -Because we promised our people peace!
[lord] We should never have surrendered.
We had no choice because we had no one to lead us.
Perhaps now we do.
The Comyns and the Balliols will never swallow that.
The Balliols have had their chance.
-Think about what you're doing here. -It's time for change.
Malcolm.
[lord] He will not be forgiven.
Robert... I'm with you.
[lord] As am I.
[man] Hurry yourself. Come on!
We must be careful on the road to Scone.
We have enemies on all sides now.
I am sorry...
for bringing you into this.
I understand.
And I know my duty.
Thank you.
I'll be with you the whole time.
[Marjorie] Can we?
-Please, can we take him? -We can't. I'm sorry.
-Seamus here will take good care of him. -Please.
Let's move out.
[man] Halt! Rider ahead.
Just be ready.
What is your business?
Halt.
I said halt!
[James] My Lord,
I am James, son of William Douglas of Douglasdale.
I recognize your father in you.
I've come to pledge myself to you as your defender.
He could be a spy, loyal to Comyn, perhaps, or even Edward.
What is it you actually want?
I want what Edward stole from my father and me.
I want my land back.
I want my name back.
Now, you give me that,
I will be loyal to you forever.
I killed John Comyn at the altar.
You should know the man to whom you’re offering loyalty.
Are you a good man?
I’m trying to be.
That’s good enough for me.
[Angus] Oh, aren’t we fortunate.
You can bring up the rear.
Let this blow be the last you receive unanswered.
Next.
[bishop] The crown worn by every Scottish king has been stolen by the English King.
So, too, our ancient coronation stone
and yet remains in Scotland a little gold and good men to work it.
We have a crown.
We have a king to wear it. Praise be to God.
I inaugurate you,
Robert Bruce, son of Robert Bruce, son of Robert Bruce,
son of Isabella Huntingdon, daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon,
son of Henry, Earl of Huntingdon,
son of David, King of Scots.
God bless the King of Scots.
[crowd] God bless the King of Scots.
Your Majesty.
I wear this crown
as a symbol of my duty to serve the Scottish people.
My title is King of Scots.
Not of the land, but of the people.
[shouting] By these swans,
I vow to avenge this murderous insult to God!
I hereby pledge my undying fealty to Robert Bruce, King of Scots.
to Robert Bruce, King of Scots.
Thank you, my lord.
Scrymgeour, you have hands like rocks.
These are paws. My father was a bear.
I, too, pledge my undying fealty.
Valence's men are assembling in Perth.
And now the real test begins.
Aye...
Your Majesty.
You were wise to join us.
That murderer is no king of mine.
Nor anyone’s much longer. The Prince and his envoy are on their way,
unbound by the shackles of chivalry.
They’re flying the dragon banner.
As King of Scots, I speak for our sovereign nation.
I demand that you return our castle at Perth.
I demand that you return to your homeland.
“King of Scots.”
You murdered my brother-in-law
and made my sister a widow.
I look forward to this fight.
We can resolve this conflict by fighting one-on-one.
Now.
I accept.
But today is a Sunday.
I know you don’t much respect holy matters, but I do.
Tomorrow then.
Tomorrow then.
That wasn't the plan, Robert.
The man's a bloody beast. Are you sure this is a good idea?
I can handle myself.
And what happens if he kills you?
Shouldn’t you wait for the Prince?
The Prince has served his purpose by raising the dragon banner.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
The King has made it clear that we must do whatever it takes.
We are dealing with outlaws, man. They have no rights.
[Robert] Trying to take everyone's money again, Archibald?
You fancy a game of knucklebone, Sire?
[Robert] Perhaps later. Go easy on them.
-[man] You arsehole. -[men laugh]
Did you get them, Drew?
Yes, Sire.
Good man.
I couldn't find any decent goblets.
-Nor any decent wine. -No. [laughs]
Alas, we are but King and Queen of the May.
And tomorrow will come to strip us of our crowns.
No.
We have too much work to do to let that happen now.
"We"?
We.

you are Marjorie’s and she is yours.
Do whatever you must.
Do you understand?
What is it? Robert?
[Angus screams] Ambush!
[man] Get down!
-Now, come! -[Elizabeth] Marjorie, up.
-[Marjorie] What's happening? -Up. Go.
-Go! Get down! -[Marjorie screaming]
-[Elizabeth] Marjorie, hold on. -[Robert] Down!
-[Robert] Neil! Now, go! -[Neil] I'm with you, Robert.
Take them to the horses, go!
Loose!
[Elizabeth] Marjorie, run! Come on, I need you to run!
[Neil] Horses! Prepare the horses!
Foot soldiers.
Atholl men, on me!
[Atholl clansman] Come on, you bastards!
Take them to Kildrummy. Lord Fraser's a friend.
Don’t worry, brother. They’ll be safe with me.
-[Neil] Come on. -Lord Fraser will take you to France.
I want you to take me. No.
I want you to take me. No. [Robert] I'll meet you there, okay?
-You take us. Daddy, please. -Be brave. I love you.
-Come on, Marjorie, let's go. -[Robert] Look after each other.
-[Marjorie] No! You can come! -[Elizabeth] Marjorie.
-[Neil] Come. Quickly. -[Robert] I'll come find you.
[Marjorie whimpering] Daddy!
Charge!
[soldier] Bruce! Ahhh!
[James] Remember the name Douglas!
[James screams] Douglas!
Douglas!
[James] Douglas!
Retreat! Pull back!
John!
Go! Go!
-[Angus] Move! Get him out of here! -[man] Go! Run!
[Valence] Bruce isn't here!
Kill all the prisoners.
Let the Scots see what comes of pledging fealty to their new "king."
-[soldier] On your knees! -[man] What about Atholl? He is an earl.
[Valence] Take him to London.
[Atholl] You bastard, Valence.
[Valence] The king will hang him for treason.
And, Percy, spread word.
Gold to those who lead us to Robert the Bruce.
Perhaps you should say a few words to the men.
And say what?
Let's get these men on the horses.
[Angus] John, you're hurt. Here, Duncan. Come here.
Thank you.
We can go to Islay, to my home.
It’s so remote, no one will think to look for you there.
We can enlist the islanders. Replenish our ranks.
Robert?
What do you think?
We don't have a choice, do we?
Fifty men to fight the strongest army in the world.
[Alexander] Robert!
[Robert] Lord MacDougall.
Have you come to join us?
And why would we be wanting to do that?
No more taxes for Edward's pocket.
No more good men dying in wars not of their making.
We can unite Scotland.
We could win her back.
You’ve got nerve, Bruce, I’ll give you that.
Comyn was my cousin.
You’re no king of ours.
[Neil] Lord Fraser, we bring the Queen.
[Lord Fraser] Your Majesty.
Follow me.
Welcome to Kildrummy.
You know, Marjorie, your mother grew up here.
-You can have her bedroom. [chuckles] -[Marjorie giggles]
[man] My lady.
-[soldier] Hang the bastards! -[villagers screaming and clamoring]
[Prince of Wales] This is what you get for supporting Robert the Bruce!
We go south, we run into Valence's men.
And north, we go back into MacDougall land.
If we take the boats across this loch,
the other side of that hill is the coast to Islay.
Ah, it's a wonderful idea in theory, Douglas, but there's more hole than boat.
This boat's good.
We can't leave the horses.
We don't need horses, we need men.
Euan, gather provisions as you can.
James, put the horses in the forest. Alexander, you come with me.
We need as many men on that boat as we can.
-Hamish, John. -[James] Horses in the forest now!
[Robert] Let's go.
We’ll be back for you.
[James] Lead the horses and follow me into the woods.
[Robert] Good man, Alex. See you soon.
[man] Not worth it, Your Majesty. It's too small.
[Robert shouts] Angus!
Look! MacDougalls!
[Euan] MacDougall!
-[James] Into the boats! -[Euan] MacDougall!
[James] MacDougall!
Bruce's men!
Hold the line!
[MacDougall soldier] Die, you Bruce bastard!
-[man] To the boat! -Quickly!
[man] Go! Into the boat!
Get on the boat!
[Alexander] Take my hand.
Come here. I've got you.
[Euan] Thanks, brother.
Alex? [Angus screams] No! No!
[Angus screams] No! No!
Alex!
No! No!
[Angus] Euan, we need the space, boy! We need the space!
[Angus] I'm sorry, boy.
[man] Come on board!
Douglas! Come here!
Get on!
-Row! -Row!
[man] Come on! Row!
Valence.
You failed to wait for me.
You attacked by night, you had the upper hand,
you had the element of surprise, and yet you lost him.
The battle was a success.
We crushed them mercilessly.
A few managed to escape.
Including the Bruce!
Your aim, our aim,
was to capture him, and you failed!
My scouts are searching for him, Your Highness.
And a reward has been offered.
It will be your head if he's not found.
-[Prince of Wales] Lord Buchan. -Your Highness.
You bring news of the Bruce?
No, Your Highness, his wife and child.
Marjorie, we've been riding horses for days. Are you not tired yet?
-[women laugh] -No.
English soldiers approaching, we have to go now.
Get to the trees, I'll send horses and men. Go.
Lord Fraser!
We know you have the Bruce’s wife and child.
Hand them over and I spare the castle!
[commander of archers] Draw!
They are not here, Your Royal Highness.
[commander of archers] Loose!
[Lord Fraser] There’s no need to burn us down.
I will open the gate.
[Prince of Wales] Neil, where's Robert?
[Neil] Your Highness, I don’t know.
Where are his wife and daughter?
They left for Turnberry on Tuesday.
They left for Turnberry on Tuesday?
[Marjorie] Elizabeth!
Where is your brother?
I swear I don't know.
I swear I don't know!
-[Marjorie] Uncle Neil! -I swear!
-You forced my hand, Neil. -[Marjorie] Elizabeth!
-[Neil] I swear! -[Elizabeth] Let him go!
-[Neil] I swear I don't know! -[Marjorie] What are they doing?
-No, please. I swear. -[Marjorie] Uncle Neil!
[Elizabeth sobbing] No! No!
[Elizabeth] Look at me!
[Elizabeth] No, no! No!
No! Stop!
No, Neil!
Where is your husband?
[whimpering] We don’t know. We don’t know.
Please, have mercy. Your father is a tyrant, you are not.
You think me weak?
Compassion is not weakness.
I have all the traits my father has, save one:
mercy.
Fraser.
You seem like a...
reasonable man.
Where's the Bruce?
I truly don’t know.
Hang them both up
for all to see what becomes of those who support the outlaw Bruce.
Take the women to England, seize all his lands.
Leave him with nothing.
See you later. [chuckles]
[Robert] Lord Mackinnon.
I heard a rumor you made yourself king,
and the Prince is tearing Scotland apart looking for you.
I've come to ask for your support.
[Lord Mackinnon] My men and I stood with Wallace at Falkirk.
Where were you then?
[Robert] There was no winning Falkirk. You know that.
How can I follow a man who's never won an open battle?
From what I've been told, you barely escaped Methven alive.
We were ambushed in the dead of night.
How many men have you?
Forty.
I'm still rounding people up.
I wish you luck. I truly do.
Come on, Lachlan! I've known you for over 25 years.
-Now just please, give us some people-- -Angus!
-[Euan] We've come here for your help. -Are you done?
I believe, in time, you'll change your mind.
And I'll be waiting.
Move.
[Angus] Good to see you all again! Hamish, how you doing?
How you doing, boy?
My darling! [grunts]
Where the fuck have you been?
You said three weeks, it’s been four months!
Much has happened, my love. Oh, Angus.
-Maybe I'll see you later, then. -Sure.
[woman] Is that Robert?
Our new king.
Aye.
Welcome, Your Majesty.
It's good to see you again, Aine.
Come! Let’s get you warm and fed.
One man to down the horse.
And one man to remove the knight.
And then to kill him.
Weak spots under the arm,
the neck... On your feet. And in the groin.
You go near my daughter again, I'll cut them off and use them as bait.
Are we clear?
What you doing, you bastard?
-I'll kick your bloody arse, Douglas, eh? -[James] You taste sweeter!
-[Angus] You think that's bloody funny? -[Robert laughs]
Right. Who's next?
[whispers] Thank goodness.
[nun] I'm to take the girl to our convent for religious training.
Only the girl.
Isn't that wonderful?
The sisters want to look after you.
And they are gonna take such good care of you.
Come, child.
Are you coming?
No.
No, but...
we'll all be home again soon.
I'm certain of it.
And Father?
Come on. Come here.
-No. -Come on, Marjorie.
Please, don't make this hard.
[whimpering] No, I don't want to go! No!
Marjorie, I'll see you soon. I promise.
I love you.
-No, I want to go back! -I love you.
-You'll be fine. -[Marjorie] Let go!
No. Elizabeth! Let go of me! Elizabeth!
Your Grace.
Angus's other daughter.
Oh, here he comes. This could get interesting.
Kildrummy’s fallen.
Every man massacred.
Your brother was hanged, drawn and quartered.
My wife? My daughter?
They’re both alive. Taken by the Prince.
We have to go back.
You wanted to be king. Well, you're king now.
This is the price you pay.
We only win if you survive.
Thinking about revenge?
I know the feeling.
It tears at the soul.
But it can also be a weapon.
No more chivalry.
Now we fight like wolves.
[soldier] Open the gate.
-You know him? -Aye.
Come on, James.
Lord Bruce.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Iain.
[soldier] You’re late.
Where have you been?
[Iain] Aye, sorry. Wheel came clean off. Took an age to fix it.
[soldier] Yeah, well, come on!
Let’s unload this before they gut the both of us.
[soldier] By the gate!
What've you got in there?
-Porridge. -Oh...
I'll have some of that, then.
Come on, get me a bowl.
Of course.

[Angus] Follow me!
Die, you bastard!
To the stairs! Follow me!
[man] Arm yourselves! Arm yourselves!
Seamus. Are you all right?
[Seamus] Your Majesty! It’s good to have you home.
We can’t stay. They’ll know where we are.
-You’re all to come with us. -Aye.
We take what we can, and burn it down.
-[Seamus] Gayle! -[Robert] Leave nothing for the enemy.
[Angus] Burn it! Burn it all!
This is how we do it.
We travel in stealth.
Strike without warning.
Take the land back castle by castle, destroying them as we go.
[Angus] It’s not exactly chivalry, but I like it.
Burn it all and take what you can!
[man] Let's move!
Robert, you know, my father’s land is only a day’s ride.
It would mean so much to me if I could take it myself.
You know, I’d only need two or three men.
Take five.
And keep your wits about you.
I've already lost two brothers, I can't bear to lose another.
Everyone out!
Good luck, boy.
[man] Palm Sunday...
[screams] Douglas!
[shouts] Douglas!
I watched once, from that very window,
my mother and father standing in this courtyard.
And my father whispering in my mother’s ear.
I don’t know what he said, but it must have been funny because she...
[chuckles] she couldn’t stop laughing.
I used to drink this water.
Poison it. Throw the bastards down the well.
Where’s that cunt Clifford?
[man] He’s gone to join Valence, my lord.
Well, then, I’ll see him soon enough.
Friends, don't be afraid. Please join me.
[prisoner screams] No!
Come, enjoy this Palm Sunday feast.
It was prepared for your enemies.
It is yours now.
As is everything in my family’s castle.
I serve Robert Bruce, King of Scots!
Join us to free our land!
Sir Richard's castle in Scotland has also fallen.
The man responsible may have been mad.
He was heard screaming the same word over and over.
Douglas.
He claimed to be fighting for Robert the Bruce.
The outlaws continue to sack their own castles,
and as word of Bruce's exploits spreads, so does his support amongst the people.
Of course, there are still nobles who remain loyal to the Crown.
This morning...
I woke up...
performed my ablutions,
and then walked from my bedchamber to the great hall.
And on the way, I stumbled.
No reason, just...
just lost my footing.
Well, I lose my footing sometimes.
Especially in the morning when the body is still waking up.
It was my hope to grow old and not die on the battlefield.
But I see now that the great danger in a death from natural causes
is that one may be lying in one's bedchamber,
thinking of all the things that have been left undone.
Fear not, Father. We will not fail you again.
Well, you managed to imprison a few women.
These gentlemen of France were in the dungeon. They wish to join us.
[boy] Is it true?
You’re the King of Scots?
[Angus] He certainly is, you cheeky wee shite.
Hey.
Go tell all your friends we’re going to win our country back.
Aye, Sire. Come on, Arthur.
[boy] Is that really the King?
[man] Robert. I bring more men.
-Drew! -[Drew] Your Majesty.
-[Angus] Good to have you back! -[man] We found them on the road.
[Euan] We thought you were dead!
[man] They tried to ambush us!
I have something for you, Sire.
I managed to take it from Methven.
Rise.
You look after this for me.
You’ve done a grand job so far.
I'll guard it with my life.
It's good to have you back.
It's all right.
All's well, Elizabeth.
[Elizabeth sobbing] You're here!
-[Elizabeth laughs and cries] -[woman] It's all right. We missed you.
Elizabeth.
Be calm. Be strong. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.
Be strong. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.
I have known you all my life.
Now, my father is only granting you this chance
because you are his goddaughter. Is that understood?
-We are very grateful-- -Margaret.
Now, Elizabeth, you are to renounce the title of Queen,
and the marriage will be annulled.
Uh...
Sign.
Your pitiful union is a charade.
[Margaret] It'll be all right.
You're doing the right thing. Do not weep.
[Prince of Wales] Come now.
Robert will soon be dead, and you can go home to your family.
If he will soon be dead, then why...
why force me to forsake him?
He's continuing to evade you...
isn't he?
Why do you laugh at me?
I have been kind!
I have given you this opportunity to redeem yourself!
Now sign it!
[Richard] My lord, I pray.
-Elizabeth-- -Take the quill in your hand. Now sign.
-Sign. -Sign.
I cannot.
Guards.
-[Richard] No, no, no. No, my lord... -[Margaret] Elizabeth--
-[guard] Come on! -[Richard] No!
No! No!
-[guard] Lower her down. -[Elizabeth crying desperately]
Wait, wait, wait!
[Robert] It’s time to come out in the open.
Their army. Our army.
Aye.
They’ll destroy us.
We've no chance against their cavalry.
[Euan] Angus is right.
If we try and face them head on,
in an open battlefield, they’ll be riding straight towards you.
Let them.
We’ll be ready.
We'll be like the spider and its web.
Best to wait, Robert,
-gather our strength. -No.
I'm done with running, and I’m sick of hiding.
We'll provoke them until they come after us.
[Edward] A raid on the Earl of Hereford’s castle at Lochmaben
by Robert the Bruce...
and 50 men.
Go ahead.
[Edward] That's fine.
-[soldier] The King! -[soldier] Halt!
If I die, you are to boil my body and carry my bones
into every battle...
with the Scots, until Robert the Bruce’s head
is on an English spike. You understand?
With pleasure, Father.
Promise me.
I promise.
Do you know...
I have never been able to imagine you leading an army into battle...
...driving your horse forward to the sound of the drum,
risking your life for the honor of the English crown...
Do you remember, Father,
when I was a boy...
and you would beat me?
I never cried because I knew it scared you.
The thought that I was stronger than you.
And the truth is...
I am.
I always have been.
And soon, the whole world will know that.
I’ll make sure of it.
Bury him here.
Shouldn't we honor his wishes?
No.
You should honor mine.
Onward to Scotland!
[Angus] Looks like you've got your fight, Robert.
Go back to your home!
[James] The English are coming!
They would take our land.
But they don’t know our land.
Here. This is the place.
Good length.
Aye, that should do.
Take them over there. Sharpen them up.
My mother says you have to return it.
Oh, I promise I will.
I've a daughter your age. I'm sure she'd like you.
Where is she?

[second man] Sam is the father of modern soul music. Absolutely.
This is Sam singing to a black audience.
It's a vastly different kind of Sam Cooke than the mainstream,

People remember Sam Cooke as a pristine Frank Sinatra wannabe.
But in reality, he was a complicated black man in a complicated world.
Record companies really did not want a black man
Record companies really did not want a black man talking about issues that were going on in the country.
They wanted him to be an entertainer and nothing more,
and that was never gonna be enough for Sam Cooke.
♪ How many deaths will it take ♪
♪Till you know ♪ ♪ Too many people have died ? ♪
In the times where everything was so oppressive,
he broke through a lot of color barriers and wasn't afraid to be the first.
Empowerment--this is what drove him to talk with Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali.
He was so unafraid.
If you afraid, you couldn't be hangin' out with Malcolm, but...
the FBI might find a way to get rid of you.
These were the early stages of black power.
That black male energy that Sam Cooke possessed,
unfortunately, for some people in power in this country,
represented a threat that had to be stopped.
This very mysterious death was just the most improbable death for Sam Cooke.
What happened? Why was he there? And who was this woman he was with?
And why'd he get shot? All those become bigger questions
than "What was he on the edge of achieving?"
It's a double murder.
It's the murder of the physical being who was Sam Cooke, but there's also the murder of his legacy.
but there's also the murder of his legacy.
One of the biggest shocks I ever had in my life.
I was on the expressway in Detroit, and the radio was on.
Soul singer Sam Cooke shot to death last night...
in Compton or wherever he was.
I was devastated.
I don't think I functioned for a week.
It was horrible.
I asked my father when he told me he was dead, I said, "What, a car accident?
when he told me he was dead, I said, "What, a car accident?
A plane crash?"
I couldn't-- Even when he told me he got shot, I...
I could've just passed out.
Who would want to shoot Sam Cooke? That's what I asked myself.
I was sad and confused back then,
and most-- other people, especially in the black community, but not only,
were sad and confused. You know, "What happened?"
Everybody was cold but anxiously waiting.
They wanted to see Sam Cooke.
They wanted to know if this really happened.
There was just disbelief and sorrow all mixed up.
Two hundred thousand people-plus showed up at his funeral in Chicago,
and this is how this man died,
you know, naked at a seedy hotel in Los Angeles.
He's one of the biggest pop stars in America,
and he's just mysteriously dead now. Didn't make any sense.
Muhammad Ali, in his grief and rage, essentially said,
"If this had happened to Frank Sinatra or The Beatles or Ricky Nelson,
the FBI would be investigating this."
'Cause, of course, it felt this all went way too quickly.
And Muhammad Ali, I think, spoke for the entire community
who believed that this was being treated as just another dead black person.
Sam Cooke, at the time of his death,
is someone who has significant meaning to the black community.
Black community loves him.
Sam Cooke didn't mean the same to white America.
They didn't recognize how important Sam Cooke was.
Sam Cooke's death, or at least the way that it's been treated in the media,
it's been allowed to sort of hijack the rest of his career.
People didn't think of Sam Cooke in that way,
but he's a racial hero as much as he was a musical hero.
Between the way he died and this representation of him
Between the way he died and this representation of him as a sort of almost one-dimensional character
kind of loses the essence of who he was.
You have to question
why did the record companies suppress his politics?

-Miss Elinor Harris. -Hello, Miss Harris.
-Sam, sit here. -Terrific.
-It's good news. -Good news, yeah.
Let's do a little capsule version of the Sam Cooke story.
-How'd it all happen... -The captions version. Uh...
Born. My father was a minister.
Uh, I started singing in the church, naturally,
because I'm exposed to, uh, gospel singing first, Mike.
Sam Cooke is born in 1931 in Mississippi.
As Sam Cooke was coming of age during the Great Depression,
late '30s into the '40s,
slavery was something that was still a residual memory for many people.
You're talking about a time where black people,
You're talking about a time where black people, especially black men, were being lynched all over the place.
I'm certain that people like Sam Cooke's family, including his father, who was a preacher, said, "We've got to get somewhere
including his father, who was a preacher, said, "We've got to get somewhere
where we can have a life for ourselves, where we can actually not just survive,
but hopefully, we can win."
My great-grandmother was a slave in Mississippi.
She had no education. Neither did my father.
He was a self-made man,
but he saw the disadvantages to the negro child in the South,
so he went north to Chicago.
In many ways, I'm very like my father.
He has this intense drive that I've got.
Papa Cook got a church in Chicago,
so everybody went to church in his family.
Bronzeville was a beautiful place.
In that corridor, from 43rd and State Street to 51st Street,
there must've been 200 to 300 black businesses that were vibrant.
Segregated, of course. All black.
It was like a black Wall Street.
Churches everywhere on every block.
There is no black politics at this moment in time without the black church.
If you were a popular gospel singer, as Sam Cooke eventually would become,
you would rub elbows with a young Martin Luther King, right?
You would know who Reverend C.L. Franklin was,
who, of course, is Aretha Franklin's father and generally regarded as one of the greatest preachers
and generally regarded as one of the greatest preachers produced in the 20th century.
Chicago was a place where people had to figure out how to hustle for themselves,
and I don't think it's a coincidence that Sam Cooke would eventually say,
"I want to own my own record label, own my own publishing company."
That's what you saw in Chicago. You saw businesses everywhere, and I'm sure he was impacted by that.
You saw businesses everywhere, and I'm sure he was impacted by that.
Papa Cook-- he knew that Sam was very gifted.
Matter of fact, the whole Cook children, 'cause they were called the Cook children.
He took 'em around to the churches to sing.

I met Sam at a concert in Gary, Indiana.
I was about 16 years old,

I believe it was Abyssinia Baptist Church in Newark
where the Soul Stirrers were a part of the program.
I thought he was the cutest thing in the world.
I was 11 years old and madly in love.
Sam Cooke joins the Soul Stirrers when he's in his late teens,
so he's 19-20 years old when he starts to go down south to tour.
There was a Chitlin Circuit black artists played back in those days,
especially through the South.
We called it the Chitlin Circuit  'cause those places
were like funky like that, you know, like, funky like chitlins.
This is the time when we were on the last legs of vaudeville
and on the beginnings of rock 'n' roll,
of-of-of that kind of R&B rock 'n' roll.
So a lot of the places that we played
were like not very much bigger than this room.
They had one microphone with five of us tryin' to sing on one microphone.
♪ ...a bad girl be-- ♪
And I'm singing "Bad Girl" into this guy's chest
because that's how close the crowd--
There was no stage, and we were on the floor,
and I'm singing "Bad Girl" into this guy's chest,
and people behind him are yellin' and screamin',
"Move out of the way. We can't see."
And so that's an example of what some of that stuff was like.
In traveling the South with the Soul Stirrers, they're dealing with where they can stay,
they're dealing with where they can stay, where they can eat, the audiences they can play to.
At that moment, you know, he's a kid.
He's got to go with what's going on, but it really pained him, you know, the heavy yoke of-of the Jim Crow laws,
you know, the heavy yoke of-of the Jim Crow laws,
which was something he wasn't really that accustomed to,
but had to get used to pretty quickly.
The conditions were very hard and very prejudice.
There were places in the South where we couldn't even stay in the hotels.
We'd have to stay in rooming houses.
We used to have to sleep in mortuaries with six bodies there,
We used to have to sleep in mortuaries with six bodies there, us sleepin' in a cot with six bodies in caskets, you know.
Sam, he didn't like the Chitlin Circuit
because he wanted to be able to go where he wanted to go, you know.
After he went on that tour down south,
he came back, and he says, "Scoe, it's a shame how people is being treated.
Somebody should do something about it."
So only thing I could say I know what he was talkin' about
because I had been through the same-- some of the same things myself.
I was comin' from school, and I was on the sidewalk walkin',
and he...
he hit me and knocked me off the sidewalk, say, "I teach a nigger how to...
how to walk on the sidewalk with a white man."
You're talking about a time
where a little black boy, 14 years old, who was also from Chicago,
with roots in Mississippi, just like Sam Cooke,
Emmet Till allegedly whistled at a white woman,
and he was beaten savagely in Money, Mississippi,
and had a fan tied around his neck and was killed.
Sam and I-- we talked about Emmett Till a lot.
We was wondering just how could that be possible?
We didn't understand it at all.
When we saw the picture, I think Sam felt really hurt on a personal level.
Sam thought that there's got to be something that can be done.
We're living in a world where we pay taxes, and we're law-abiding people, you know what  I mean?
This should not happen to a 14-year-old anywhere, you know,
This should not happen to a 14-year-old anywhere, you know, so he was, like, very bitter about that.
It was a wake-up call,
and it was actually, the really, the beginning of the Civil Rights movement.
Sam had things on his mind that he wanted to do,
and he especially wanted to help his people, our people,
and he was determined to do that.
And he told me, "'Scoe, one of these days, the world gonna know Sam Cooke,
and I'm gonna help my people."

Sam was a person of the early rock-'n'-roll generation,
so he was hearing Chuck Berry.
He was hearing Little Richard.
♪ Oh, now lawdy, lawdy, lawdy, Miss Clawdy ♪
♪ Girl, you sure look good to me ♪
I met Sam in Specialty Records' office
in 1953.
They were celebrating "Lawdy, Miss Clawdy"
because it was their first rock-'n'-roll record to ever sell a million copies.
Sam would sneak off to rock-'n'-roll shows
because he saw something bigger, you know.
Sam knew all of the joints to go to.
He'd say, "The Soul Stirrers didn't know, but we'd be out
till two or three o'clock in the morning and have to sing the next day."
He'd say, "But Sam would be ready," you know.
When he came to my show at the Apollo, I pointed something out to him.
I said, "Now, you had about 300. I got 1,700 in here.
They're doin' the same thing here you had 'em doing in Richmond in church.
There's no different than this."
And he just didn't wanna switch.
But all the gospel singers back during that time didn't wanna switch.
You know, I guess it was because of the fear of Jesus.
We are told straight up in the black church,
"Either you're gonna sing God's music, or you're gonna do the Devil's music."
And there's a kind of a guilt complex that gets tied to that because you're like,
"Well, I wanna sing God's music, but this Devil music's got me dancing.
And this Devil music can make me famous. I can do more things with my life."
He said himself, "I was afraid at first
because I knew that if I switched over...
if it didn't work, I couldn't come back with the Soul Stirrers."
That's the way people were. Once you went out there, they weren't forgiving.
Once you went out there, they weren't forgiving.
Papa Cook was like my father, you know.
He said, "Boy, let me tell you something.
You can gain the world...
and lose your soul.
You're doin' good with the Soul Stirrers. Everybody loves you.
You're known all around the country."
But Sam told him, "I want to be known all around the world."
Sam was saying early on, "I wanna make a wide range of music.
I wanna appeal to a wide range of people."
Well, why is that? It's about freedom.
I think he understood that whatever he was doing in this period
would have an impact on the people who would come after him.

The first record that he came out with, he didn't use Sam Cooke.
He used Dale Cook because he was afraid of the backlash.
We used to, "Man, that's-that's-that's gotta be Sam. I don't know anybody-- I haven't heard anybody who sang like that."
At some point, he just made peace with the fact that,
"I'm gonna make the kind of music that I wanna make,
and I'm gonna use my name-- C-O-O-K.
I'm gonna add a "E" to it for some flavor,

It's a song that was probably too pop-ish for Elvis Presley.
When they announced they were gonna have Sam Cooke on Ed Sullivan's show...
we knew that the record was a hit.
For African-Americans, of course there was this great pride.
You know, not everyone has a television, so it wasn't unusual that you might have

Dick Clark from American Bandstand
was also a concert promoter all around the country,
and he hired Sam Cooke to come down to Atlanta and to do a live show.
Dick Clark has such an impact in terms of how young folks listen to American music.
If you're Sam Cooke, you had to be on that show.
Sam was about the only black, or I should say negro singer at the time on the show,
and the Klan members down there had a problem with that.
Suddenly, there are threats coming from the KKK
suggesting that perhaps you should not go up on that stage.
Ku Klux Klan had just bombed a Jewish synagogue down there,
so we know they meant business.
Sam told us Dick was thinking about canceling
'cause he was getting all of this threatening mail,
and people saying that they were gonna blow up the studio if he had a-a nigger on, you know.
if he had a-a nigger on, you know. That's just the way it was, you know.
Dick Clark did what a powerful white man would do.
He called the National Guard to keep people safe from the KKK,
but what Dick Clark didn't know
that probably most black people in Atlanta knew
that you probably couldn't trust the National Guard, either.
That's how pervasive this was.
[Dick] Welcome aboard. It's nice to have you here on a Saturday night.
He was angry, but he wasn't afraid to go nowhere, not Sam.
[Dick] It's Sam Cooke.
For Sam to go and do it anyway,
absolutely courageous, absolutely fearless,
because he was breaking boundaries, you know,
and I think Sam realized very early on "This is bigger than me."
What Sam Cooke would've said is that, "I'm a man,
and I'm a black man, and as a black man, I have a responsibility to go on this show
I have a responsibility to go on this show and bring down whatever walls I can bring--
whatever boundaries I can help dissipate by showing that I am talented,
I am skilled, I can compete with the best of them.
And in fact, there was an audience within white America
that was very interested in having me seen there."
Los Angeles, California, when you live in Cleveland, Ohio, is like a...  a wonderland.
He had moved out to California where all the movie stars,
so we looked at him as really had hit it big, you know.
He could be the forerunner.

Sam likes the idea of suddenly being in these exclusive circles
with very powerful white people
who could help him, and he could learn from them.
It's kind of changing his idea of who he is and the influence he can have.
RCA built their own studio at Sunset and Vine,
and I was the first engineer they hired.
Recording Sam was like catching fish in a barrel.
He wrote the songs. He sang the songs. He knew exactly what he wanted.
We spent a lot of time together, and Sam got inside me, you know.

My very first tour was with Sam Cooke.
We were in South Carolina,
and Sam says, "Everybody hungry?" We say, "Yeah."
We walked into this little place, and we sat down and were asked to stand up.
and we sat down and were asked to stand up.
Oh, ok.
And we asked. I said, "Are you gonna take our orders?"
"You gotta shut up and wait till I get to you."
So me and my big mouth. I said, "You know what you can do?
Take that order and shove it." And we left.
Ten minutes later, there was a police officer...
that came to the bus...
and he stepped onto the bus.
And Sam said, "Can I help you?"
He said, "Yeah, we wanna know who those two gals were
that were rude to the waitress in the tavern house."
And Sam says, "First of all, we don't have gals on our bus.
We have ladies and gentlemen...
and this happens to be my bus. It's private property,
and I'm gonna ask you kindly to step off of it."
He thought about who he was
and those around him, who they were,
and that they were not going to take advantage of anybody that he cared about.
I will never forget the day I was unable to fulfill a one-night singing engagement in Georgia
I was unable to fulfill a one-night singing engagement in Georgia
because I wouldn't sit in a Jim Crow bus,
and because no white taxicab driver would take me from the airport to the city.
And negro cab drivers were not permitted to bring their cabs into the airport.
We used to play places in the South whereas the audiences,
even though they were integrated, they were segregated
because the white people would be upstairs,
and the black people would be downstairs or vice versa.
Or there'd be a big stage in the center of this arena,
and white people would be on one side, black people on the other,
not even hardly lookin' at each other.
They had signs that said, "General Admission--2.50.
White spectators--a dollar and a half."
They'd sit up in the top of the places and watch the black people dance, you know. It was sickening.

In February of 1960, Jesse played the first integrated show in Arkansas.
It was a big deal.
After the show was over, everybody left, went their separate ways,
and about a half an hour out on the road, Jesse Belvin had a... head-on-head-on collision,
and it was fatal.
[Davis] Jesse Belvin, his wife, and three other people died.
At first, we thought it was an accident, but later, we found out that his tires had been cut by some locals in the area.
but later, we found out that his tires had been cut by some locals in the area.
It was very, very shocking, you know, 'cause he had a great future ahead of him.
Of course it was a message.
I think Sam sort of saw that potential and wanted him to be a bigger star,
and in that sort of terrible way, he was just sort of cut down. He was gone.
So now he wasn't just carrying Emmett Till,
he was also carrying Jesse Belvin with him and the things that he wanted to do
and the ways that he wanted to break down racism.
On May 12th, 1961,
we were playin' the Memphis City Auditorium.
Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson. It was at least about 12 acts.
So Sam asked the people that's in charge,
"Would the blacks sit at in the auditorium?"
The guy say, "Well, the back and the balcony, but they can't be up-front."
So Sam said, "Well..." He said, "I can't perform here."
Sam would say... "How does it look?
You know, I'm a star, and I'm known the world over...
but in my own home country...
I'm goin' along with some shit like this.
I'm gonna perform while my people is up in the balcony,
I'm gonna perform while my people is up in the balcony, and the people downstairs can dance and have a good time,
but my people can't dance?
I don't care what nobody else do. I ain't goin' for that shit."
Sam gathered a meeting with all of the entertainers...
to boycott the show.
And everybody agreed,
"Yeah. Yeah, Sam. You're right. You're right. Yeah, we with you, man."
Went back to the hotel.
I went to Beetle Street first and got me some bourbon.
I laid down, took a little nap.
And I got up later...
everybody-- I went round and knocked. Everybody had gone and went back to the auditorium.
Everybody had gone and went back to the auditorium.

I said, "They said they was gonna stick with you," you know.
He say, "Yeah, I know."  He said, "But..." He said, "I'm not goin'."
I'm not sure that Jesse Belvin's death
had an effect on the outcome of this boycott Sam was trying to do
because they was afraid what could happen to them.
He was takin' a big risk.
He could've been hurt or killed there, you know, at that time, you know.
That's when I saw him in a different--
I had never seen that in him before.
And the hotel that time was the Lorraine.
Same hotel Martin Luther King was killed at some years later.
I've always detested people of any color, religion or nationality
who lack courage to stand up and be counted.
It is a difficult thing to do.
I hope, by refusing to play to a segregated audience,
it would help to break down racial segregation here.
And if I'm ever booked here again, it won't be necessary to do a similar thing.

During that time period, there were major artists,
Nina Simone comes to mind,
whose music would get banned from parts of the country
for some of their political stances.
And Sam was taking a big risk by saying, "I don't wanna play in a segregated space,"
you know, particularly because he was a major star.

Folks who didn't understand that Sam actually had some political concerns,
you listen to a song like "Chain Gang,"
which just the rhythm of the song immediately would resonate
for generations of black folks who know about places like Parchman
and other prison farms.
Yet you see these photos of Hugo and Luigi, his two producers, and Sam Cooke,
and they're comically dressed up in their black-and-whites and little caps,
and so it's a way to take this song and bring it to mainstream white America,
but is also delivering a particular kind of critique
of what would've been a prison industrial complex of the late 1950s,
in which white audiences and black audiences hear that very, very differently.
And there had been so few examples of black artists
who could code switch in that way
and be recognized in both the black world and the white world and still be men.
What white people have to do
is try to find out in their own hearts
why it was necessary to have a nigger in the first place
because I'm not a nigger.

He went on TV, where his mother almost passed out because of the hair.
Heh. She did not like it, and she said,
"Oh, look at my child."
Sam would talk to L.C. about,
"Man, you ought to get that process out your hair and let it go natural."
He felt that it was part of his history... his culture.
Switched over immediately.
All the black guys started gettin' the fros, you know.
Sam was a powerful man.
We were in Atlanta,
and in between concerts, he'd go to a newsstand and buy every magazine,
and one day, he went and bought a boxing magazine.
And there was this guy.
I said, "Sam, this kid is the shit."
He said, "All right, go get him."
And I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "Tell him I sent you."
I said, "Oh, my God."
I knock on his door. His brother Rudy cracks the door, and I said,
"I'm with the William Morris--" and he slams the door in my face.

Right? That there was another way for them to be in the world
other than the way that the world had dictated that black men had to be in the world.
It disturbed perceptions of what black masculinity was.
Cassius Clay very quietly was being mentored by a man named Malcolm X,
who was this fearless, and very much feared, black leader in America
who spoke, as he said, truth to power.
It's not hate to say that we were kidnapped and brought here. It's true.
It's not hate to say we were Jim Crowed, discriminated, and segregated. It's true.
Sam Cooke doesn't know Malcolm X yet,
but he's just seen how the Nation of Islam moves,
how they dealing with white supremacy,
He's, "Oh, this is kind of interesting." Right?
And he starts paying more attention to Malcolm X. They eventually become friends.

Cassius Clay announces the next day, "My name is now Muhammad Ali."
Clay was a white man's name. It was a slave name.
And I'm no longer Clay, I'm no longer a slave,
so now I'm Muhammad Ali.
Because he's a clean-living young man,
and this is the main thing that the honorable Elijah Muhammad
does teach in spreading the religion of Islam throughout the--
among our people in this country.
We saw a picture of Sam with Malcolm X,
and we were askin' him, "Was he thinkin' about turnin' to be a Muslim?"
And he's like, "Nah, man."
Sam was drawn to the economical part of it--
owning and having your own.
We didn't see the Muslims here as spiritual.
It was more educational.
About self independence.
That's what it all was about.
I'm sure the RCA marketing people would've had great concern that Sam was hanging out with Malcolm X.
would've had great concern that Sam was hanging out with Malcolm X.
They would've feared the loss of considerable portion of Sam's audience.
If you're RCA, you don't want your mainstream black artist
talking about those kind of politics,
so there's a second verse of "Change is Gonna Come"
that was famously deleted when it was initially released,
that very explicitly talks about segregation
and Jim Crow segregation in the South.
♪ And I go downtown ♪
♪ Somebody keep telling me ♪ ♪ Don't hang around ♪
And I think it's very telling that, you know,
the record company deleted that verse because they were concerned
about what kind of reaction the public would have
with this very political verse in the song.
At that moment in his career,
Sam was a musical icon, a culture hero, who had reached out to white audiences,
and had a real foothold in those white audiences, and could play a show like the Copa, and it's incredibly successful.
and could play a show like the Copa, and it's incredibly successful.
And yet, he never had left his black audience.
And you hear all of that in "Live at the Harlem Square,"
and "Bring It On Home To Me"
is just such an amazing, powerful moment on that record.
♪ I'll always be your slave ♪
♪ Till I'm buried ♪ ♪ Buried in my grave ♪
♪ But while I'm livin', bring it to me, Bring back-- ♪
There's something else in that "Harlem Square"  recording
that's so much grittier and blacker.
♪ Everybody's with me tonight ♪ ♪ Look, listen, let me hear you say yeah ♪
There is something terribly tragic
that folks didn't get to hear the "Harlem Square" album... until 1985.
I think there's probably several reasons
why it wasn't released at the time it was recorded.
I can't discount the fact that RCA didn't relate to it on a commercial level.
Forget about... you know, too R&B, too black... or whatever.
That was not the guy they wanted playing Vegas and the Copa,
which were things Sam wanted as well,
but Sam felt there was room to do both of those. The record industry didn't.
I think the more they pushed it aside, the more Sam pushed forward with it
because he had to be who he was. He had to fulfill that.
These things had been important to him for a very long time.
Sam really wanted to build an empire.
He felt he could do it,
and he was not afraid to do it.
Sam had an ideal of getting all the big entertainers
like Jackie Wilson, James Brown... to put all their money together,
like Jackie Wilson, James Brown... to put all their money together, and let's start our own big record company and booking agency all within one.
and let's start our own big record company and booking agency all within one.
The mob has always been involved in the record industry...
simply because it's a lucrative business.
He would get phone calls, and he would get visits from mob figures
who wanted a piece of his businesses.
There were some guys that came up to Sam's dressing room,
and he would never let us leave the dressing room.
He said, "Anything you can say, you can say with my little brothers."
So they were like, "Sam, look here.
We hear you're tryin' to start a music union of your own,
and we want you to leave that alone."
But he's like, "Well, fuck all y'all.
I don't give a damn about that shit.
Hell,  I'm gonna-- I will do what I wanna do."
And Sammy Davis even called Sam, said, uh...
"You got to listen to these guys. These guys are serious guys."
It was very courageous and was scary, too, you know, 'cause a lot of people was...
"Oh, man. Oh, no, you can't mess with that." You know.
"I don't wanna get killed." You know.
I got a phone call at the office,
and they wanted to have him come home... immediately.
and they wanted to have him come home... immediately. There was trouble.
And he went home and found out that his son died.
Vincent was... by the pool,
Vincent was... by the pool, and Sam's wife went in the house for a little while,
and he just slipped into the pool... and he died.
And, uh,  it affected Sam a lot.
It took a long time for him to be able to even talk about it.
And then it was a touchy subject that you don't wanna bring those kind of things up to anybody.
that you don't wanna bring those kind of things up to anybody.
Every time he walked in the house, he walked right by the pool
in the front yard that his son died in.
So he didn't have a lot of peaceful days at home after that.
It affected his marriage a lot.
I would sit many a time at the dinner table...
and Sam would get up to go out.
And Barbara suspected what he was doing. Every-- we all knew.
He was a womanizer.
He started drinking a little bit more Beefeaters.
He... It changed him.
After Vincent died, all he wanted to do was work. He poured himself into his work.
Immediately wanted to go on tour. "Let's go."
♪ And I know, I know, I know ♪ ♪ A ring that's rollin' ♪
♪ Has no end ♪
♪ And, oh ♪
♪ A baby when it's sleepin' ♪
♪ There's no cryin' ♪
♪ A baby when-- ♪
He's masking the very real pain and loss in his life-- the loss of a son.
And that's in concert with just the added pressures of being Sam Cooke,
as being famous, as being a celebrity, as being what most white folks
as being what most white folks would've thought of as a credit to the race.
That doesn't come without a price.
It was renegotiation time at RCA...
so Allen Klein, who's become Sam's manager,
"I'll tell you what. I'll negotiate the contract."
And they came up with a concept where they'd create their own record company,
separate from RCA, and then lease the material out to RCA.
The company was named Tracey Limited,
and Tracey was the name of Sam's middle daughter.
And how it was explained to Sam
was that this would be a venture
where Sam would own the company,
own the rights to the recorded materials,
be in charge in the studio, which is something he really wanted.
It turns out that Sam was bedridden around this time.
He had the flu.
What that time period did was give Sam a chance
to look through his papers,
and he realized that there were things that weren't right
as far as the ownership of his music business,
and he realized that, "Wait a minute. Things are very wrong."
I can imagine... it would be quite a shock...
when he learned that the real effect of all of this paperwork
is that Allen Klein was the owner of Tracey Limited,
which, in effect, makes Sam...
an employee... of Allen Klein.
Before he died, Sam said to me, "I'm gonna leave that asshole."
That Thursday, he had proclaimed that he was gonna fly to New York Monday
and make a whole lot of changes, including firing Allen Klein,
but he never made it through the weekend.
Sam and I had talked earlier in the day, and we were gonna meet... for dinner... at Martoni's,
and we were gonna meet... for dinner... at Martoni's,
and we were gonna meet... for dinner... at Martoni's, which was a big music hangout on Cahuenga.
I had brought my wife at the time, Joan, with me.
Sam had... a few martinis.
He liked his martinis, and, uh...
and we were talking about... we were gonna do a blues album.
Sam pulled out a big wad of money from his pocket.
I mean, it was like a fistful of money.
And he said to Al, he said,
"I just came in off the road and look what I got,"
or "Look what I earned," or something like that.
And Al said to him, "Yeah. Sam, don't be flashing that money here.
Put it back in your pocket. Don't show that around."
And Sam kind of laughed, you know, because in Sam's mind,
nobody ever would try to take money from Sam Cooke. Are you serious?
I mean, in his mind, he was invincible.
When we got up to leave, Sam went up to the bar, and this woman was there.
Sam went up to the bar, and this woman was there.
When we left... as I recall, he was still at the bar,
you know, talking, laughing, carrying on.
Now...
there's all kinds of things that go on with what happened after that.
[female] The number is PL79984.
-[male] 79984? -That's a telephone booth I'm at.
-Uh-huh. What street are you on? -[female sighs]
-I don't know. -What's your problem there?
Well, I-I was kidnapped.
-You were kidnapped? -Right.
-But you have no idea where you're at? -[female sighs]
No, it's pretty dark here.
Can you stay right there in the phone booth?
-Right. -I'll find out where you are.
-You stay right where you're at. -I will.
-Ok. -Bye.
-What is your name? -[female hangs up]
Joan and I got home... went to bed. Five o'clock, the phone rang.
And I heard that Sam Cooke...
was shot.
I went to the police station,
wanting to know more details about what had actually happened.
The desk sergeant said, "What is going on here?
We've had calls from everywhere.
We even had a phone call from London. Who the hell is... Sam Cooke?
Just another n-word killed in Watts. What is the big deal?"
So I told him he was a fucking idiot.
I joined the Los Angeles Police Department in May of 1959.
The attitude of the police at 77th Street toward the black community
was just purely suppressive.
All blacks look alike, and all Asians look alike. Right?
The official story is that Sam went out the night of December tenth
and met a woman named Lisa Boyer
in a restaurant called Martoni's,
and he left with her and went to the Hacienda Motel.
And he... dragged me into that room.
I started talking very loudly, and I told him, "Please take me home."
He latched the night latch on... and, um...
he pushed me on the bed, and he says, "Well, we're just gonna talk."
I knew that he was about to rape me...
so while he was in the bathroom, I picked up my clothes, my shoes, and my handbag.
I opened the latch, and I ran out.
She grabs his pants... runs out,
so he went to the manager's door and started bangin' on the door,
so he went to the manager's door and started bangin' on the door, 'cause he thought... the girl was in there.
'cause he thought... the girl was in there.
Miss Franklin stated that the deceased came to the door...
and started pounding and shouting and asking if his lady friend was inside.
And at this time, the deceased...
broke the door open.
And he grabbed both of my arms
and started twistin' 'em and asked me where was the girl.
I started kickin' ,and I-- he maybe have a bite. I don't know.
But I tried bite him through that jacket.
[man] You tried to bite Mr. Cooke? Yeah, I was fightin', scratchin', bitin' and everything.
Yeah, I was fightin', scratchin', bitin' and everything.
Finally, I got up and grabbed a pistol.
I started shootin'.
[man] And how many times did you fire this pistol?
Three times.
Did you know you struck Mr. Cooke?
Yes, 'cause he said, "Lady, you shot me."
I didn't believe that Sam was killed the way they say they did.
I didn't make sense of that, and Papa Cook didn't make sense of that.
I don't believe it. That's far as I go with that.
That just didn't sound like him at all, at all.
I never seen him be aggressively at-at-at a lady.
Sam wasn't that kind of a guy.
[stammers] That's totally bullshit.
He wasn't that kind of a guy that had to be domineering or have power over people.
I never saw that in Sam ever.
It turns out that she was a hooker, and she was a Hollywood hooker.
There was the idea that the girl had come to this place before,
and she threw his pants out the window, which had all his money in the pant--
the $5,000 I told you about earlier.
Somebody was out there, her pimp,
and grabbed the pants, and then she ran out with that person.
And rumor had it that Bertha was in with the mob.
That she was like a pimpess or something.
It was ruled that Bertha Franklin shooting Sam Cooke
was a case of justifiable homicide,
and nobody bought that.
It just didn't seem like he was the person that got shot down in the way that he did.
There had to be something more in play,
and that's what fueled the idea of this being some sort of conspiracy.
Elvis believed that there was a sense  in the music industry
Elvis believed that there was a sense  in the music industry that Sam was getting too powerful and had to be stopped,
that Sam was getting too powerful and had to be stopped,
which echoed what a lot of people in the black community thought.
You know, that this was about a black man who didn't know his place,
and to stop him, he had to be murdered.
They didn't mind Sam seepin' through the cracks
and being successful on his own.
But the problem was that too many other entertainers
were watching Sam and listening to Sam.
That was the problem.
There's another wild theory that Allen Klein killed Sam Cooke.
Well, from what I hear...
he had the argument with Allen,
maybe two, three days before.
Allen Klein loved Sam Cooke, but he also was a thief.
He used his love to steal his songs.
Klein was ready to take everything.
He did a similar thing to the Rolling Stones,
and he was one of the forces that broke up The Beatles.
Well, the problem with that is that in 1964,
Allen Klein didn't have the kind of power to set up this big, elaborate murder
where the police is gonna be a part of it, too?
And the district attorney? Allen Klein--he wasn't that powerful yet.
I was on a plane coming back from New York,
and I hadn't seen Barbara in quite some time,
and as I recall, she said, "I sold Sam's work, and I got $50,000."
and as I recall, she said, "I sold Sam's work, and I got $50,000." Or something. Some ridiculous amount of money.
I mean, obviously it's worth millions and millions and millions of dollars.
KAGS, which was the publishing company, and SAR Records...
all went to Allen Klein.
J.W. Alexander died broke.
What it is is inequality.
What it is is someone was in a position to take advantage and they did.
It's a double pain. The pain of losing Sam and the pain of, uh...
losing what he worked for,
what he was all about, what he fought to establish.
Whether or not there was any real conspiracy that went down,
we won't know because there wasn't a thorough investigation done to find out
because to many people in the LAPD who were investigating this case,
and just to be quite frank, Sam Cooke was another nigger...
and this was just more nigger shit.
And it didn't deserve any more attention than what it got.
When you see someone as prominent as Sam Cooke...
get killed like that under very mysterious circumstances,
and even his life is not valuable enough to have a real investigation
by local law enforcement there in Los Angeles...
it's not a surprise that to this day,
there are a lot of people who still believe
that there was some sort of cover-up, some sort of conspiracy around the death of Sam Cooke.
some sort of conspiracy around the death of Sam Cooke.
I mean, what else are we gonna think, particularly given our history in America,
our relationships with law enforcement all over the country,
and the fact that if you happen to be a black person who speaks out in any kind of way,
who speaks out in any kind of way,
who does anything  that seems to be empowering for the black community,
you are automatically a target.
If we were to transpose today back to then,
we would say black lives matter. Right?
And in 1964, even Sam Cooke's black life didn't matter. Right?
even Sam Cooke's black life didn't matter. Right?
So... it's-it's-it's just hard to overcome that.
Do I think that the events of Sam Cooke
and the institutional attitude contribute to the upcoming riots here?
Well, absolutely. Absolutely.
I don't wanna say Sam Cooke's death caused the Watts riots.
I don't wanna say that.
But Sam Cooke's death is a really big example of a million things
that caused dissatisfaction among black people in America.
Those people being, you know, murdered, being enslaved, being imprisoned.
Like, all of that, is why.
And Sam Cooke is yet another example of that.
Black people don't trust law enforcement for good reason.
It is not beyond the realm of possibility to a lot of people
that the FBI was somehow involved in Sam Cooke's death.
That he was set up in some way,
that he was murdered because he was just becoming too threatening,
you know, through the work he was doing, the people he was associating with,
and the music he was now gonna start making.
See, it's one thing to have a little meeting.
It's another thing to put out a song that could sell a million copies
and is on the radio, and everyone's gonna start to hear and absorb.
So, you know, people, whether it was true or not...
deeply felt that, you know, the government was involved in this.
In a very short period of time...
Medgar Evers, Sam Cooke,
Malcolm X,
King a little later.
Langston Hughes isn't killed by the state, but, you know, there are very real losses.
Something really...
powerful and important and intimate to blackness,
it gets lost with those deaths.
That's a part that white America will never fundamentally understand.
What we know is that we never got to see him as a fully mature artist
and thinker and activist
who, had he lived, would've had a dramatic impact on the next generation
of artists, thinkers, and activists.
We could've had this monument to what was to come.
"A Change is Gonna Come," there it is. But that's all we have.
The song isn't released until after he dies.
"Change is Gonna Come" is the perfect ending
for a career that was way too short... for a life that was way too truncated.
It was a long time coming in 1964,
and it is the shame of this nation...
that that song should still be so relevant.
The activism is one thing, but the music is powerful.
"Change is Gonna Come" communicates the rent of black life in America,
and Sam Cooke taps into that with such poetry.

[man] All I can say to you, darling, is Sam Cooke's yours.
He'll never grow old. Sam, it's been nice.
And during that period of time, around about 3,700 people were killed,
and upwards of 40,000 people were injured.
[reporter] The result of all this has been that a whole generation of teenagers
have grown up deprived of the normal social outlets
that kids can expect elsewhere.
That's why it's so important when some kind of entertainment survives.
[reporter 2] Right now, many dance halls may have to close down
and that's because of what happened to the most popular group in Ireland.
That group could fill any hall north or south of the border.
It was called the Miami Showband.
[man] The Miami Showband was Ireland's most glamorous band.
Often, we couldn't even hear ourselves playing.
You know, it was just all the screaming.
♪ I feel like things... ♪ [woman] You just squashed in. You didn't care what pain you suffered.
[woman] You just squashed in. You didn't care what pain you suffered. You stood on your foot once you were there.
[man] They were our superstars.
I was absolutely over the moon.
Here am I, band leader of one of the best bands in the world.
The Irish Beatles.
-[siren wailing] -[man] I was devastated.
[man] Why would anyone want to hurt the Miami?
Everybody loves the music.
[woman] The showband scene was never the same again.
The music died the night the Miami died.
[reporter] Do you think that the Miami Showband could've been a random assassination?
[man] I don't think that it was random. I think that they were singled out.
[man 2] It shocked people to the core here.
[man 3] I'm determined to find out who murdered Miami Showband,
even if it leads up to the very top of the British government.
[man 4] It's been over 40 years, but we're finally getting closer to the truth.
I was born and raised in South Tipperary, which is in the Irish Republic,
far south of where the Troubles erupted in Northern Ireland,
which is part of the United Kingdom.
My father was very much a nationalist.
My father would definitely want to see a united Ireland.
I mean, that's what Irish people want.
But there was no hatred, there was no dislike of Britain.
My dad volunteered
to join the British Army at the outbreak of World War II.
I was brought up with the respect for a uniform.
They represented all that was good.
I was never in any way suspicious of...
of the Irish state or of the British state.
I knew nothing about politics.
My parents, they had seen what politics can do,
so they were really happy when I decided to play an instrument
and devote my life to that, you know?
-Hi, lads. -Nice to see you.
-Hello, mate. -How are you doing?
[Travers] In '62 and '63, the Beatles took over the world.
[Travers] I heard "Love Me Do" on the radio.
So, at the ripe old age of 11, I decided to join The Beatles. Uh, It was that simple.
[Travers] One day, this young lad asked me
if I were interested in playing bass guitar in his group.
And I had never played bass guitar.
But I thought, "If it's good enough for Paul McCartney, it's probably good enough for me."
And the minute I touched it,
it was like somebody plugged me into a socket.
I played it until big blisters came up on my fingers.
And, uh, I started to get better and make some sense of it.
[Travers] And that was the start of my music.
[Travers] And I rose up the totem pole very quickly.
Well, at that time, the conflict in Ireland was raging.
[reporter] More bombs in Northern Ireland, leaving the now very familiar piles of rubble.
There'll never be peace until these people recognize
Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom,
and will remain so.
[female reporter] Northern unionists, mostly Protestant,
want Northern Ireland to maintain the union with Britain.
And nationalists, mostly Catholics, want a united Ireland.
There'll never be any friendship between Protestants and Catholics again.
There's a bitterness.
[female reporter] The most potent paramilitary groups - on the loyalist side, the UVF, or Ulster Volunteer Force,
on the loyalist side, the UVF, or Ulster Volunteer Force,
and on the Republican side, you have the Provisional IRA,
the Irish Republican Army.
[Travers] As terrorism by the paramilitary groups from both sides escalated,
it was the civilians who suffered mostly.
But at the same time that this was happening,
showbands were hugely popular in Ireland,
North and South.
♪ Any old way you choose it ♪ [Travers] And the showbands covered the popular music of the day,
anything that you could dance to.
The showband scene was fantastic,
because people were living in the Troubles and it was a release for them.
To get dressed up and go to a showband, it was like therapy.
[Travers] There were so many showbands back then,
but the biggest show in the country was the Miami Showband.
I had to audition,
but I had absolutely no doubt whatsoever that I would just walk up and get that job.
I was that confident.
♪ I didn't care 'cause I was searchin' ♪
I remember their front man, Fran O'Toole, because he was just an icon.
All the girls fell in love with him.
[Travers] The girls would have Fran's picture in their bedroom, all that type of thing.
In fact, he was once described as Ireland's greatest ever soul singer.
He was that good.
This show is called Me and My Music.
It's all about songs that I write with a friend of mine called Des Lee.
Des was the band leader.
And seriously into his songwriting. He was Fran's songwriting partner.
We slept...
drank, and ate music.
And my primary instrument was the saxophone.
Brian McCoy was highly respected in the music industry.
Great trumpet player, and he idolized his family and his children and his dog.
Ray Millar was the drummer.
He was great fun to be with, and that told in his drumming.
And our guitarist Tony Geraghty, who was unusually gifted as a musician.
We got very close very quickly.
He'd look over at me and we'd smile at each other
and we'd put something extra into the music. Sort of like a telepathy.
[Lee] We all lived in the Republic, in Dublin,
but we were an extremely popular band in Northern Ireland.
[Travers] There was terrible atrocities being committed.
But through the middle of all of this murder and mayhem,
we were equally popular on both sides of the border,
north and south, to a mixed audience.
You look down at an audience and...
you can't pick out the Catholic and the Protestant.
They all looked the same, they spoke the same.
Back then, I actually didn't know
what religion anybody was in the band.
Ray Millar and Brian McCoy were from the North and were Protestants.
Ray Millar and Brian McCoy were from the North and were Protestants. The rest were Catholics.
It was never a question of religion or politics.
The only currency in our band was...
"How well can this guy play?"
That was it. Yeah, that was the religion for us: music.
Like all of the other bands on the circuit,
we were criss-crossing the border into the North on a weekly basis.
I bought into this, uh, idea that musicians were immune.
None of the bands were ever affected by the problems of Northern Ireland.
So...
what happened to us on the 31st of July came as an absolute shock.
[Travers] The venue was the Castle Ballroom in Banbridge.
[Lee] Banbridge is in Northern Ireland.
We had come from Dublin, which is in the Republic.
We got to the gig,
everything was as normal.
And on that particular night,
they would've shouted up, "Clap your hands! Stomp your feet!"
'Cause that was Fran's number one.
[Devlin] I remember "Clap Your Hands, Stomp Your Feet,"
'cause we would've been about three feet off the ground when we were doin' it.
Just went crazy! We just went crazy when they played it!
We called our last song,
and the people started screaming and shouting.
They wanted "more, more, more." That's all you heard.
We left Banbridge... It was probably around about two o'clock in the morning.
Now, there were five in the van, because Ray, the drummer,
had gone straight back to Antrim in his own car.
And within a period of about ten, fifteen minutes,
we saw the torches...
flagging us down.
Brian turned back to us and said, "Guys, there's a check up ahead."
[Travers] Once you got into the North, you were liable to be stopped
by, uh, authorities.
This particular night,
we were asked to get out of the van.
[Travers] We got out. Stood near the van.
I could see about five soldiers. They were all armed with machine guns.
And the soldiers were very friendly. They were actually joking with us.
But there was a man who appeared on the scene who seemed to be in charge.
The minute he arrived, everybody became more professional.
When he spoke, it was a distinct, very posh, educated English accent.
Not a Northern Ireland accent.
When you were stopped at a roadblock in Northern Ireland,
it was not normal to hear a British accent.
That voice stood out for me above all the rest.
[Travers] Brian nudged my elbow,
and he said, "We'll be away quickly. This is the British Army."
I felt safe.
Uniform to me meant law and order.
They were there to protect us.
Just then, I heard other soldiers opening our Volkswagen minibus.
And, all of a sudden...
[Lee] The van exploded. There was fire like mad.
There was shooting. There was screaming.
There was crying. There was mayhem.
And the impact of the actual bomb going off on the van
blew me over the ditch down into the field.
[Travers] The whole world for me turned red.
Everything was in slow motion. And I tried to run. I heard the gunfire.
The soldiers jumped down into the field after us,
and they started shooting.
[Travers] I could hear Fran saying,
"Please, don't shoot!"
-[man sobbing] -[automatic gunfire] And I could hear voices screaming,
saying...
"Are you sure all those bastards are dead?"
I heard a voice from the road, in a Northern Ireland accent, that said,
"Come on! I got those bastards with dumdums. They're dead."
I got onto that main road.
It was like an absolute war zone.
There is blood everywhere.
There's body parts everywhere.
I called out Fran, Brian, Tony's names.
None of the three of them answered.
And Steve was moaning.
I called out, "Steve?
I'm going to Newry Police Station to get help."
[Devlin] I came on duty the next morning to see the Miami Showband...
had been ambushed...
and there was three members killed.
And one in intensive care.
[Travers] I had been shot with, uh,
what they call a dumdum bullet, which is an explosive bullet.
It exploded into...
it was something like 16 pieces inside me.
So it did a lot of damage.
[Devlin] All the staff was concerned whether he would survive or not.
Everybody was just...
[exhales] sick.
I just willed God for him to live.
[woman] I expected Brian home about two,
so I fell asleep, and didn't hear anybody coming in.
[woman] And I got a phone call about seven o'clock in the morning from Brian's brother-in-law.
He said, "Oh, I heard there was a band ambushed at the border."
I said, "But I... [shudders]
I don't know. I've got a bad feeling."
And I put the radio on to get the eight o'clock news.
And it announced Brian was killed. [inhales]
[Travers] When I woke up in hospital,
I would say, "How are Tony and Fran and Brian?
When can I see them?"
The answer I got from everybody was, "Well, some are better and some are worse."
But eventually they had to tell me...
that they were dead.
♪ That here I spent ♪
The morning after the massacre...
there were police officers who brought me into a room...
and asked me to help them draw an Identi-Kit of someone
who I remember was involved that night.
And there was one thing that stuck out in my mind.
I was always a fan of Buddy Holly's.
One of the guys had these heavy-rimmed, dark glasses.
And they found part of his glasses on the main road.
So, that's how they caught one of the murderers.
[Travers] Two men had been arrested and charged for the murders.
As I got better,
I began to realize then that I'm a witness to this thing.
We were very nervous about going back up North to testify.
But I said to Stephen,
"We need to do this for the lads.
We need to go to court to help the lads get these guys convicted."
[Travers] When I saw the men who murdered my friends,
I didn't recognize them. Des recognized one of them.
[Lee] The families of those that were accused were screaming at me,
"One day we will get you! No matter where,
no matter when!"
[Travers] But when I mentioned that, on the night of the incident,
there was a British officer arrived at the scene
there was a British officer arrived at the scene and that he was the man in charge of the operation,
it was always dismissed. We were always told, you know,
"Well, you know, you're wrong there." Or, "It doesn't matter."
At the time of the trial, I wasn't interested.
I just wanted this over and done with,
and if these guys were guilty, send them to jail, and if not, let us go home.
Well, there... Of the original band, we have two of the lads. We have Ray, our drummer here,
We have Ray, our drummer here,
and we have Stephen on bass guitar. Two of the original members.
-[man] And yourself. -And myself, making it three. Yeah.
[Lee] Putting the Miami back together was...
to a great extent, it was naivety.
We just wanted to push it aside.
[reporter] Without playing even a single note,
the Miami had become Ireland's top showband again,
mainly due to the universal sympathy they've received.
[Travers] The crowds were even bigger.
The hysteria.
I had this impression, "They're coming to see us, not to hear us."
It was more voyeurism than appreciation of music.
[Travers] I shouldn't have gone back. I was... severely traumatized.
I got physically better reasonably quickly.
I got physically better reasonably quickly. I was young. I was only 24 years of age.
But it's just something that...
presses in on you and stops you from living a normal life.
The management persuaded me to stay until the summertime.
I couldn't wait to get out of the band.
Anne and I decided that we'd go to London and start a new life
and become anonymous.
I thought, "I'll never again have to worry about anything.
I'll just stay here, then forget that night.
I'll keep this pushed away.
This is not part of my life anymore. This is just history."
We lived in London for about 17 years.
But, no matter what I did in my life,
this thing was always there.
While we were in London, Ireland had changed.
We decided, "Look, it's safe.
Let's move back to Ireland."
But questions were being raised about the murder of the Miami Showband.
So I was asked to give evidence at the Barron tribunal,
which suggested that it was more than just a bunch of thugs
that were responsible for our event.
Perhaps these questions are worth following up.
I said, "I owe it...
I said, "I owe it... not just to the guys who were killed, not just to our friends.
I owe it to myself as well to get some answers here. I've waited a long time."
That's when I met Margaret Urwin,
who had already done extensive work investigating cases, including ours.
Obviously, the Miami Showband was particularly targeted.
The intention clearly was that...
the bomb would kill all of them.
[Urwin] But the bomb exploded prematurely.
[reporter] The bodies of two men were discovered near the wreckage of the van.
[Urwin] And the people who were killed were Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville.
[reporter] Tattoo marks identified them
as having been members of the Protestant Ulster Volunteer Force, the UVF.
[Travers] Obviously, I knew the name UVF, Ulster Volunteer Force.
But I knew nothing else about them, until my investigation.
Loyalist paramilitaries like the UVF
were prepared to do anything to maintain the union with Britain, including murder.
-[man] You've got guns? -Yes.
-And you're prepared to use them? -True.
-And you have used them? -Yes.
[Urwin] There were many arrests in the days following the attack.
Two of those convicted were Thomas Raymond Crozier
and James Roderic McDowell,
also members of the UVF.
[man] "Killings like the Miami Showband's must be stopped," said the judge,
as he sentenced McDowell and Crozier
to the longest life sentences in Northern Ireland's history.
[Travers] There was one other name that surfaced all the time.
The local branch of the Ulster Volunteer Force, the UVF,
had just recently had a new leader called Robin Jackson.
He was known as the Jackal.
Robin Jackson was possibly the most prolific murderer
in the entire history of the conflict in Northern Ireland.
[Travers] It's alleged Jackson was responsible for between 50 and 135 murders,
either carrying out the murders himself or with his gang.
And the former prisoners who served time with Jackson
unrelated to the Miami Showband incident told us that he would lift his shirt
and show off the burn marks that he received from the bomb blast.
Robin Jackson had been brought in for questioning
about the Miami Showband massacre.
I was an active police officer for 37 years.
I was the head of the intelligence within J Division, where Jackson lived.
Jackson was actually, uh, a number one target of ours.
He was lifted in connection to the Miami Showband
because of A - the locality where it happened,
it was Robin Jackson's home territory -
the fact he was a leading light in the UVF,
the fact that he was an associate of Boyle and Somerville.
But they didn't have circumstantial evidence or forensic evidence.
And Jackson just remained totally silent when interviewed.
So, he walked out.
[Travers] And because I had to know more about this,
I spoke to two former British intelligence officers.
[Wallace] During the late '60s and early '70s,
I was with the Army in Northern Ireland.
I was the Senior Information Officer.
But that was a cover title for psychological operations.
My role was to collect information about how we could disrupt the terrorist organizations.
about how we could disrupt the terrorist organizations.
We were dealing with a huge level of violence.
People now forget just how violent it was.
My job was to recruit sources
within the terrorist organizations who would give us information,
which would help us fight terrorism in all its forms.
Both sides, Protestant and Catholic.
And towards the end of my time there, I did most of my work for MI6.
[Holroyd] MI6 is the British equivalent of the American CIA.
So, in other words, they're spies.
We were pretty clued up on who was carrying out the violence,
what their political motivation was,
and what they were trying to achieve.
The reason we were monitoring, uh,
Harris Boyle and that particular gang was because we knew they were terrorists.
Robin Jackson, the Jackal, was one of the up-and-coming thugs in the area
who was muscling his way into the organization.
And it's my belief that Robin Jackson was involved in the Miami Showband attack.
The terrorists set up a roadblock,
dressed as members of the Ulster Defense Regiment.
In other words, looking like real members of the Army.
[Holroyd] The Ulster Defense Regiment was the Army in Northern Ireland.
[Urwin] In fact, uh, the two were arrested for the Miami murders,
McDowell and Crozier were both serving members of the Ulster Defense Regiment.
Many loyalist paramilitaries had infiltrated into the local Army,
and were taking guns from them and using them to kill people.
[man] In one burst if you wish. But when you're firing, fire in short bursts,
short, sharp bursts. And you can judge it by squeezing the trigger:
short, sharp bursts. And you can judge it by squeezing the trigger: squeeze, one, two, release.
[Wallace] Robin Jackson also had been a member of the Ulster Defense Regiment in the early '70s.
of the Ulster Defense Regiment in the early '70s.
By 1972, almost 100 weapons were stolen from a UDR Reserve Army base.
It quite clearly was an inside job.
We believed Robin Jackson was one of the people involved in that robbery.
The police searched Jackson's home
and they discovered that he had some ammunition he shouldn't have.
But Jackson was allowed to stay free. Why did that happen?
Almost every single weapon used in the Miami Showband murders
originated from the UDR or the police in Northern Ireland.
Every one of them.
Senior officials were very quick to deny
that there was any police or Army involvement in the Miami attack.
Then, of course, Crozier was charged.
[man] Major, it's difficult for people to understand
how the killers of the Miami Showband
could've been allowed into the Ulster Defence Regiment.
If...
there was nothing known about them...
when they applied, then there's no way
that one could disbar them from joining it.
I would've been one of the people that thought,
I would've been one of the people that thought, "It was just a few bad apples."
That these people were renegades or exceptions.
I just refused to accept any notion of collusion.
Collusion is cooperation between...
terrorist groups and the Army and the police.
I wanted to believe that the system worked.
2005 was an important milestone.
It's the 30th anniversary of the Miami Showband massacre.
It brought it all back,
not just to me, not just to the families and friends,
but the entire country, North and South.
It's a hard day to be back here today, ah,
at the actual spot.
[Travers] It forced me to think about it in a way that I hadn't really thought about it before.
That we were fighting for truth.
Maybe even more than justice.
I felt a duty.
I was determined to keep going.
And in 2005, there was a breakthrough.
I first met Alan Brecknell when he was investigating
the murder of his father, who was also killed by the same gang
that murdered the Miami Showband.
So, I suppose that's what's brought me into the work in 2005, 2006.
The police service in Northern Ireland set up the Historical Enquiries Team
with the sole purpose of trying to answer questions for families,
to review every single death.
[reporter] Police intelligence papers have at last come to light.
They were found by detectives from the Historical Enquiries Team, the HET.
[Travers] I thought it was just another group that I was going to give evidence to.
As it turned out, it was quite important.
What has been made public is new and disturbing information
that centers on this man, UVF Commander Robin Jackson.
[Urwin] One of the weapons tested and found to have been used in the Miami murders,
a Luger pistol, was found about ten months after the murders.
Now, with the pistol was found a silencer wrapped in insulating tape.
Robin Jackson's fingerprints were found on the silencer.
But there was a mistake made
by the fingerprinting department initially in their report.
And they said that his fingerprints were on the tape.
[Brecknell] Robin Jackson come with a ready-made excuse
for why the fingerprint would have been on the insulating tape.
Clearly, somebody had tipped him off.
And the question has to be asked: why was someone within the police force
giving Robin Jackson information if this is the most notorious Loyalist gunman in the North at that time?
if this is the most notorious Loyalist gunman in the North at that time?
[Travers] The result of the HET inquiry handed us the police on a plate.
They gave us a smoking gun.
[Cadwallader] The Historical Enquiries Team found that the detective who questioned Jackson
initiated a complaint against officers that tipped off Jackson.
The report went up the chain of command, and then... poof!
Nothing happened.
There are no records as to where that actually went,
and what the outcome of it was.
And that wasn't the first time that he has escaped justice.
[male reporter] Within 90 seconds, central Dublin had been devastated.
[male reporter] Thirty-three lay dead, and nearly 300 were injured.
To this day, it remains the worst atrocity of the Troubles.
There have been bombs here before, but nothing of the scale of yesterday's.
[Urwin] Three bombs exploded in Dublin during rush hour,
and then, about an hour and a half later,
a fourth bomb exploded in Monaghan Town in Northern Ireland.
The terrible atrocity in 1974,
which was just a year before the Miami,
we're talking about May '74 and July '75.
I can tell you that I do know and believe that some of those that were involved,
uh, in the Miami had a hand in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.
[male reporter] Also named were three leading loyalists as the planners of the bombings.
Harris Boyle, a UVF major,
and a loyalist killer, known as the Jackal.
Atrocities were allowed to be carried out by the Protestants. We knew who they were.
We had information, and no action was ever taken against them.
[male reporter] Captain Holroyd was surprised
that he was not ordered to investigate the Dublin bombings,
since he was the Military Intelligence Officer
since he was the Military Intelligence Officer where the suspects were based.
We've got a list of names, uh, that we call the Protected List.
[Brecknell] Colin Wallace actually provided a list, a year before the attack on the Miami,
of people who he knew to be loyalist paramilitaries.
And on that list is quite a few of the people who were involved in the Miami.
[Travers] Colin Wallace asked for permission
to target some of the people on the Protected List.
But he was never given permission for that.
Jackson...
and the other people on that list, had they been taken in,
had they been arrested, had they been charged with offenses,
they wouldn't have been there to kill our guys.
[Wallace] In my view, the UVF had links that were much too close
with members of the British intelligence community.
I was the youngest Senior Information Officer in the Ministry of Defense.
My reports were extremely good,
and, overnight, I was out.
Why did that suddenly change?
[Travers] There's no other conclusion we can come to other than members of terrorist groups
were working either for or with British Military Intelligence.
[Cadwallader] We believe that and other evidence against him
clearly demonstrated that Robin Jackson was an agent!
[Travers] An agent is someone who is working for British Military Intelligence, MI5 or MI6.
who is working for British Military Intelligence, MI5 or MI6.
You have somebody who is...
murdering people at the same time as he's being controlled by the state.
That, in my view, makes the state complicit.
I knew all of this. A lot of people knew all of this.
But what could we do with it?
All we could do was feed it into the system.
And if the system doesn't allow you to act on it, you can't act on it.
[Travers] I just couldn't deny it anymore,
that there was collusion, as part of a system.
And I had to find out how far up this went.
I have no interest whatsoever in anybody being punished,
but I have every interest that we change the system,
because it is not right to kill innocent people.
I'm extremely hard to turn.
But once I turn, I do not, I will not back down.
The more I learned, the more I realized,
there's something that was glaringly obvious.
The British officer that had arrived at the scene.
And I began to think...
maybe the reason that this British officer is being dismissed out of hand
maybe the reason that this British officer is being dismissed out of hand on so many occasions is that it's not that he wasn't relevant.
on so many occasions is that it's not that he wasn't relevant. It was because he was very relevant.
[Travers] Then when I insisted to the HET, “I want to know more about this officer,"
they said, "Well, it wasn't really a British officer.
McDowell was putting on an English accent to fool you."
It didn't make any sense.
Why would a man who knows you're going to be dead in ten minutes
try to disguise his accent?
There was nobody wearing a balaclava. It was just nonsense.
[Travers] I felt that the HET were keeping guilt on this side of the Irish Sea.
The HET was set up by the British government, so they were answerable to the British government.
so they were answerable to the British government.
We've trusted that their conclusions would be fair,
accurate, without bias.
[Travers] But they weren't.
There was this concerted effort to throw anybody from Northern Ireland,
i.e. the UDR or the police,
they're gonna throw them to the wolves.
They didn't want to involve the British establishment.
When I wouldn't accept that,
they cornered me after one of the meetings.
It was very intimidating.
They said, "We don't know when you first brought
the British Army into the narrative!"
That worried me, because I thought,
"How do I prove that I've been talking about British Army
as opposed to UDR for all these years?"
So, I went home and...
I said to my wife, "I feel that they've won this argument."
And she immediately solved the problem.
She had newspaper cuttings
on an interview that I did exactly two weeks after the incident.
And I clearly say that Brian McCoy, our trumpet bearer, said,
And I clearly say that Brian McCoy, our trumpet bearer, said, "Don't worry, Steve. This is the British Army."
I sent it to the HET and I said, "Will you now revise your conclusions on this?"
And they refused even to acknowledge that I sent it to them.
I don't need any inquiries to convince me that there was collusion.
I don't need any inquiries to tell me
that there was a British Army officer on the scene,
in charge of the operation on the night. I know that.
The HET was not going to give me any answers about the British officer.
So I realized that I needed to find another source of information.
The obvious people that we needed to talk to, uh...
were the people who had been jailed, who had actually committed the crime:
Crozier and McDowell.
At this stage, they were released, as part of the peace process.
After two years of talks and after a generation of bloodshed,
and decades of division and acrimony, a new era of peace.
[Ahern] The prisoners Tony Blair and I let out,
to an overwhelming majority, were lifers, people who had got life sentences,
were lifers, people who had got life sentences, some of them for 40 years.
To get to them,
we would need permission from the leadership of the organization that they were a part of,
from the leadership of the organization that they were a part of,
the UVF, the Ulster Volunteer Force.
You don't find the UVF in the Yellow Pages.
You can't just dial the operator and say, "Can you put me through to the UVF, please?"
But I remembered that there was a friend of Fran O'Toole's,
and I heard he had been involved in the peace process
as some sort of liaison between the UVF
and the British and Irish governments.
Stephen Travers contacted me,
and he had read a lot about the work I had done with...
loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland.
And he felt I might be able to open a door for him.
And he came back and he told us, "Look, you won't be allowed to meet Crozier and McDowell.
"Look, you won't be allowed to meet Crozier and McDowell.
But there's a possibility
that I can get you a meeting with the leadership of the UVF."
And what they always say is the second-in-command.
The code name was to be the Craftsman.
Chris rang me and he said, uh, "There's a taxi waiting downstairs for us.
Chris rang me and he said, uh, "There's a taxi waiting downstairs for us. We're going to meet this man now."
And I just looked at him and said,
"All they can do is kill us!"
Uh, which seemed perfectly logical to me,
but that just gives an indication as to how happy I was
to be close to getting some answers.
[Hudson] The Craftsman sat down and he took out handwritten notes,
[Hudson] The Craftsman sat down and he took out handwritten notes, probably about eight or nine pages.
And he said, "I knew this day would come."
[Travers] The Craftsman told me that...
the intention was that we would be at home safely in bed,
and this bomb would've gone off.
And they would've put out a statement that they can reach
into Dublin and into the heart of the Irish Republic.
But I knew from the scene-of-crime officer
that it was a short-term fuse, ten to fifteen minutes.
This would have exploded...
killing everybody on board.
I asked the Craftsman about the British officer. It was...
actually...
surprising. He didn't deny that there was a British officer there on the night.
He said...
"He took some risk, that Brit." That's what he said to me.
But there's been a name bandied around all the time.
In 1987, in the British Parliament,
the identity of the officer was being discussed.
I'll read out what was said.
I quote:
"It has begun to emerge that Captain Robert Nairac
is quite likely to have been the person who organized the killing
of the three Miami Showband musicians." End of quote.
Mr. Livingstone outraged MPs
by making a series of unsubstantiated claims about Northern Ireland.
These included the allegation that Captain Robert Nairac,
who was killed by the IRA in 1977,
may have organized a series of murders in the province.
Mr. Livingstone, what is the point
of this gratuitous insult to the memory of the dead?
The more I got into politics, the more I discovered about odd things
that you didn't know so much about.
A -  what was really going on in Northern Ireland.
Some of the horrors that had been carried out by British troops illegally.
Nairac wasn't some mad psychopath who enjoyed killing.
He thought he was working for Britain's long-term interest.
[Cadwallader] Robert Nairac was a member, we believe, of the 14th Intelligence Company,
a shadowy British counter-insurgency group.
There are allegations that Nairac was the owner of the British voice
heard on the side of the road that night.
He was seen with Jackson.
He was seen with Harris Boyle, killed at the scene of the Miami.
Who knows what Robert Nairac was?
When I met him, he said he worked for the MI6 officer that I was working for.
I knew Robert Nairac.
I think he's a person who was so... enthusiastic,
I think he's a person who was so... enthusiastic, he could've been manipulated by people in the intelligence community.
he could've been manipulated by people in the intelligence community.
He certainly lied to me about what he was there for.
As soon as he got information, he would carry out operations which,
we now believe, Colin and I, were actually...
to abuse that information and use it in collusion with the terrorists.
[reporter] Our information, from associates of the gang,
indicates that Captain Robert Nairac of the British Army Special Air Services,
played a key role in the Miami killings.
Captain Nairac handed over the bomb and the guns for the operation,
in the deserted car park of this cash and carry premises in Portadown.
And what I've not the slightest doubt
is that if these allegations about Captain Nairac are true,
he was merely following orders.
What we need to get to is those highly placed spies within MI5
who were prepared to authorize missions like that.
Prepared to actually see the innocent, um, completely innocent people,
Prepared to actually see the innocent, um, completely innocent people, like the Miami Showband musicians, murdered.
like the Miami Showband musicians, murdered. We are talking about treason at the heart of the British state.
I am the Right Honourable Michael Mates. I was a member of Parliament for 36 years,
an Army officer for 20 years.
[man] How long do you think the people of Northern Ireland
will be able to call themselves British?
For as long as you and I are alive and for as long as they want to.
Towards the end of my time in the Army, I did five tours in Northern Ireland.
We were very nearly at war with these...
We would've been at war if it hadn't been on British territory.
And this was what you got into all the time,
tit for tat killing here, and tat for tit there, between the two communities.
Some very nasty things were done by both sides.
And so it went on.
And the poor old British Army and Security Forces just had to try to hold the ring.
You...
were watching out more for an IRA atrocity than you were for a Protes... for a UVF atrocity.
[reporter] IRA gunmen continued to fire sporadic shots.
[man] At the present moment, we are at war with the British Army.
They symbolize something in this country...
that has been hated for centuries.
It was the rule of...
British imperialism in Ireland.
[Mates] British soldiers, very soon they got to realize
who the enemy was. The enemy wasn't the Protestants.
The Protestant extremists only very rarely attacked the military, very rarely.
And so, they thought, well,
these guys may be pretty nasty,
but we're on the same side.
Well, the Provisional IRA is the only enemy we have.
Is it just the IRA?
Yes, the IRA: the gunman, and the bomber.
Protestant terrorists were allowed to operate relatively unhindered.
They were working for the Security Forces in eliminating...
known or suspected, strongly suspected,
IRA members.
-And when I say Security Forces-- -Murdering them?
Murdering them. Assassinating them.
[Travers] The British use locals against locals.
They side with the one they think is going to win.
In this case, the Ulster Volunteer Force, the UVF.
And they use them to defeat the IRA.
That's what the British do. That's how they built their empire and held on to it.
They've done it all over the world.
[Holroyd] The British Army, under political instruction,
started carrying out tactics which obviously were excessive and unlawful.
I realize that, in fact, they were deemed lawful by the authorities.
By my own authorities, by my own politicians,
and it came right down from the top.
[Holroyd] Colin Wallace and I wrote to Mrs. Thatcher
and sent her a 32-page letter,
a list of operations that were unlawful in Northern Ireland.
And none of that information was used.
The actions of the people who were involved in it were allowed to carry on.
[Thatcher] The government have repeatedly declared
that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom,
and will remain so,
unless its people and the Parliament at Westminster decide otherwise.
And she should've taken action, and she didn't take action,
and then denied that she'd seen the documents.
[Livingstone] When I raised the issue of the Miami Showband in Parliament,
there was this bizarre moment. Because Mrs. Thatcher was totally predominant.
She stood there like a pillar.
She sort of glared everybody down. [chuckles] They were questioning her.
And she wouldn't look in my face. She seemed hunched.
I just knew, clearly this was something she felt vulnerable about.
Mrs. Thatcher's doing everything possible to prevent that investigation
and no democracy can have these sort of allegations made
and refuse to investigate them openly.
[Travers] The more evidence I saw, I had to realize that the British government,
through its proxy Army,
they chose us as innocent victims,
to murder us so that they could achieve their political aim.
We were targeted because the British authorities
wanted the Irish government to seal the border with the North...
so that the IRA, having committed some sort of atrocity,
couldn't cross easily into the relative safety of the South.
So they decided, "Let's frame the most innocent and trusted commuters."
People who traveled up and down.
And we would have gone down in history
as terrorists carrying bombs for the IRA.
When a government decides...
to murder its own citizens,
and to murder the citizens of its closest neighbor,
there's no way that you can excuse that. There are no mitigating circumstances.
That you can choose somebody. "Let's murder him for the greater good."
Now, they would argue, these people,
that they're doing this for the good of the country. And they probably are!
That's the irony. But it's not democracy.
They want it both ways.
They want to out-terror the terrorists,
and equally claim that they're law-abiding.
I objected to that and made my objections known.
I had become an embarrassment.
I'd have to be replaced rapidly and got out the way before I stumble over
any more than I already knew.
As a result of that,
I was removed from Ireland in a particularly unpleasant way.
They took me straight to Netley, which is, um,
They took me straight to Netley, which is, um, a notorious Army psychiatric hospital.
a notorious Army psychiatric hospital.
Well, they kept me in the hospital unlawfully,
uh, for a month.
More importantly, and here we link to Colin Wallace's case,
I had to be discredited
so that whatever I said would not be believed, no matter how valid.
[reporter] Both Holroyd and Wallace each left under a shadow.
I was being misused by the authorities, knowingly,
who then basically didn't want to admit
that they were actually authorizing such activity.
My removal from Northern Ireland, my disciplinary hearing,
were both rigged.
That was followed, then, by a murder charge.
Uh, a colleague of mine disappeared
and his body was found floating in a river.
The pathologist said he'd found an injury to the nose
that'd been caused by a martial arts-type blow,
i.e., someone with military training.
Eventually, I was convicted and sentenced to ten years.
[man] The case against Wallace was extremely weak.
The only evidence was circumstantial.
I had absolutely no doubt
that Colin Wallace was innocent of manslaughter.
I actually believe that Wallace was framed.
[man] Framed by whom?
Uh, I think by the intelligence services in this country.
There's no point in shooting the messenger, you discredit the messenger.
If you shoot the messenger, then that raises eyebrows and questions.
The message in this is
to people who are thinking of blowing a whistle, don't.
The system, to protect itself,
will go to great lengths to destroy anybody
who alleges misuse of power.
To be used as just pawns in their political game,
I felt ashamed.
Because I had such respect for the British people,
I felt in some way almost like betraying things that I loved.
It's just that the weight can become so heavy that you...
you can't function.
There's so many times that I wake up in the morning and I...
I'm really sorry that I'm awake.
I've recently been diagnosed with a thing called enduring personality change.
Something I had never heard of.
You enter...an event...
and, uh...
you come out the other side of that event, um,
a completely different person.
I was this cocky, confident musician.
I was...
I was very happy with my life.
My wife is very happy with her life.
We're very happy together and...
all of a sudden, this thing happens. And I remember asking my wife Anne,
And I remember asking my wife Anne,
"Did I actually change after that?" And she told me, "It was...
like learning to live with another person.
And, by default, learning to love another person."
The only thing I was ever good at in my life, ever,
was playing this instrument.
It was the only thing that I could...
I could do without even worrying, without thinking about it.
I mean, I didn't even have to rehearse. It was one of those things.
And that was gone.
And I felt for a long time afterwards
that there is nothing else in this world that I can contribute.
And I realized that this person was...
left back in a field, uh, on the 31st of... July in 1975.
In 2006,
I got a phone call from a policeman called James O'Neill.
James O'Neill was the scene-of-crime officer at our event.
He was called out to collect the evidence on the morning.
When I met James afterwards, his notes were immaculate.
He was obviously very professional.
But he also brought along...
the autopsy pictures.
James said, "I've got these pictures that are not easy to look at."
And I said, "Well, I'm prepared to look at them."
And they were horrific.
Uh, there was pictures of the lads... in the morgue.
Very badly injured. I mean... terrible.
After the incident,
I had blocked all of that out of my mind.
And I realized that up until then,
I didn't accept that they were dead.
I thought somehow or other, this was just a bad dream. It was a mistake.
Even all those years afterwards.
To me, Tony wasn't dead.
Nobody could kill Fran O'Toole, he was too big a star.
Brian McCoy, he's probably off with his family.
In the back of my head, this wasn't rational.
When you have to look at them like that...
I knew they were dead.
And there was a time when I thought...
"Perhaps I'm actually dead...
and that I won't accept my own death."
That's a question that comes up now and again, yeah.
I was relieved that I wasn't in those photographs.
It was an impetus in some way...
to resolve these things, this pain that's inside you.
You can't unless you...
unless you take these steps, and that was a giant step.
It was confirmation that our investigation
It was confirmation that our investigation was the right thing to do, and to move forward with it
with even more determination.
It was British terrorism in Ireland
that dragged me into this narrative.
And I'll see it to the finish.
I want this superpower to know that they've been in a fight,
because I won't back down.
They murdered my friends. They left me for dead.
They tried to frame me and my entire family as terrorists.
I have woken up. I will beat them for this.
We've, uh, got a court case against the MOD,
We've, uh, got a court case against the MOD, the British Ministry of Defense.
I want Britain to acknowledge its crime. I want it to say that this will never happen again.
I want it to say that this will never happen again.
Stephen and I work together a lot
with the court case in Belfast at the moment,
in the High Court.
It's just appalling
that the authorities involved have left us waiting over 42 years...
to get justice.
They've tried every dirty trick in the book.
They delayed and prevaricated.
We had what they call "general discovery."
They swamped us with documents.
All sorts of skulduggery that they come up with.
But that, in a way, makes us even more determined.
[Pat Kenny] Steve Travers, one of the survivors of the Miami Showband massacre, is with me in studio.
of the Miami Showband massacre, is with me in studio. -Welcome to the program. -[Travers] Thank you, Pat.
-Welcome to the program. -[Travers] Thank you, Pat.
We've been fighting and fighting for what they call "discovery."
In August, I think it was the 30th, the judge granted us  82 of 84 documents.
the judge granted us  82 of 84 documents.
[Pat Kenny] Meantime, you get information from the Irish government,
which is quite extraordinary.
[Travers] I've just received this letter. It's from the Ulster Volunteer Force.
There is a letter that has been in possession of the Irish government
for the past 30 years,
from the UVF, telling the Irish government
that MI5 had asked the UVF
if they would assassinate Charlie Haughey.
They were telling our government about this because they wanted to let them know
because they wanted to let them know that they didn't want any hand, act or part in it.
It's on headed paper. I didn't know they used headed paper,
but apparently they did.
It's dated the fifth of the eighth, '87.
And it says, "Colin Wallace, Fred Holroyd were telling the truth when they revealed
that British intelligence were behind killings, kidnappings..."
This was a letter complaining about the treatment of the UVF by MI5,
This was a letter complaining about the treatment of the UVF by MI5, who they admit in the letter that they were working with.
They had been given faulty detonators,
faulty bombs, by MI5.
And they say, "as in the case of the Miami Showband."
Something as fundamental as this could have given us closure 30 years ago.
-Good to see you, Winston. -How you doing, Stephen?
-Very well, thank you. And you? -I'm good, thanks.
There was a context to what happened,
um, with the Miami Showband attack.
Um, it is my understanding, as someone close to the thinking of the Ulster Volunteer Force,
as someone close to the thinking of the Ulster Volunteer Force,
uh, that...
there was absolutely no intention, on behalf of that UVF operation,
to kill members of the Miami Showband.
You know, Winston, that I wouldn't accept that.
The facts just completely go against that.
But I don't think it's, uh,
it's helpful for us to argue... -No, indeed. -...over the semantics of these things.
The entire thing was a disaster.
One of those impediments to healing and to reconciliation
One of those impediments to healing and to reconciliation is the fact that, uh, responsibility is not accepted
is the fact that, uh, responsibility is not accepted by either the loyalist paramilitaries, republican paramilitaries, or the state.
by either the loyalist paramilitaries, republican paramilitaries, or the state.
So, it's good that we can sit down here together,
and you can put forward your point of view and that I can tell you
and you can put forward your point of view and that I can tell you that I completely disagree with it.
And, yes, we don't stand up and storm out of the room
and say that we can't make something good of this.
Yeah, I think that's important, and we need to ensure that events of the past
doesn't become part of the politics of the future.
And I think this simple message that needs to go out,
uh, that there should be never again any more victims.
That's very encouraging to hear that.
Uh, I would hope that this would be
the beginning of a process rather than simply an event.
Yes, absolutely. And one that has a much wider participation.
And one that has a much wider participation.
[Travers] It is significant that the people who were responsible for that awful atrocity
have sat here with us
and pledged to try to rectify things.
And the fact that he's gone on record on camera
on behalf of the organization, that's huge.
With regard to what type of justice we actually... I would like to see truth.
And if there is an amnesty, I'd personally agree with, uh,
a conditional amnesty, if people stood up and told the truth.
The real leaders that you need here are the ones who will hold both atrocities up and say, "There is nobody here
are the ones who will hold both atrocities up and say, "There is nobody here
that has a monopoly on suffering or loss,
and there is nobody here that has a monopoly on the skulduggery
that went on over the last 40 years."
I don't think I have a purpose to live for, other than this.
I wouldn't, if I had admitted that a couple of years ago. It's defined me.
Perhaps in some way, we can make a difference.
Anything like that gives me a sense of worth.
Uh, might get me out of the field.
[Travers] I never, ever wanted to be anything other than a bass player.
That's it.
When I play music today, I can be the person that I was.
Because, um...
it's the one thing that I had then that I still have.
Music is the common language. It's something appreciated and loved.
by everybody, regardless of what their....
political, religious views are. Whatever.
We were bringing communities together.
When we played, sectarianism was left outside the door.
That's the power of music.
The people who do these type of things, they're afraid of beauty.
They're afraid of all the goodness that's in society.
[woman 1] He became a symbol of the power of the people.
[woman 2] He was a cross between Bob Dylan and Martin Luther King.
[man 2, Spanish] One song by Víctor Jara is more dangerous than 100 machine guns.
[woman 3, in Spanish] He was too much of a threat. They had to kill him.
[man 1] The coup in Chile is known as the first 9/11.
[man 3, Spanish] Víctor wasn't only murdered, he was murdered in the worst possible way,
tortured to death.
[man 4] It's one of the great unsolved murders of the twentieth century.
It's very important that we know exactly the details of what happened.
-This next song is for Víctor Jara... -[audience cheering]
...for those who fought against injustice and who paid the highest price.
[speaking Spanish] If you are a political musician...
...Víctor Jara...
...continues to be a great inspiration.
[woman 4] It's taken more than forty years and we still don't have
justice for Víctor Jara.
[man 5, in Spanish] Those responsible for this crime have lived their entire lives
as if they hadn't done anything.
[male reporter] The question remains, who killed Víctor Jara?
Today, a jury will pass judgement.
[man 6, in Spanish] I was not at Chile Stadium.
My hands are clean, have never tortured anyone.
[man 7, in Spanish] If he says he wasn't at Chile Stadium, he's lying.
[man 8] There's no doubt he was there that day. There's no doubt that he was giving orders.
[examiner, speaking Spanish] In 1973, did you shoot and kill Víctor Jara?
Did you kill Víctor Jara?
[in Spanish] There was always a guitar at home...
-Uh huh. -...because my mother was a singer.
She would sing at funerals, baptisms, and weddings.
She'd sing folk songs passed on through the generations.
I think the first thing that, you know, I'd like to tell you about Víctor
was that life with him was fun.
He enjoyed living and he made the people round him enjoy life, too.
[Joan] Víctor and his family were very, very poor.
They lived on one of these enormous farms
where the peasants really lived in a feudal state.
One of his earliest memories is being yanked out of bed
to go and wash his feet in the ditch, you know, around beside the house,
and to go out and get firewood to light the fire to heat the water.
[man, speaking Spanish] Chile, at that time, was a very unjust country
with vast social disparity.
On the streets, you'd see children living in poverty
with no shoes in the middle of winter.
Poverty was something that beat you down.
Víctor Jara carried that with him.
[speaking Spanish] In June of 1960,
when I was finishing at the University,
I met Víctor...
...Víctor sang a repertoire of traditional music.
But he also started composing his own songs.
For example, ♪ Paloma, I want to tell you That I'm lonely, that I love you ♪
That's a song he composed for Joan. He was deeply in love with Joan.
And we had a little house. And we made it our own.
We planted trees and a garden and...
well, this was Víctor's little island, you know, full of love.
[Mariela] Víctor started with love.
All of his songs were about love.
We are who we are because of love,
and we want to be better because love exists.
The world turns... creates... and multiplies because love exists.
[Mariela] Later, he began to speak of what was going on in Chile.
[Eduardo] He collected the experiences of the community.
All of these stories he collected directly from the people.
-He went and listened... -[crowd chattering] ...and then he wrote those songs.
For example, in "El Arado," he sings of the peasant experience.
♪ Firmly I press my hand ♪
♪ And plunge the plow into the earth ♪
♪ I've been doing this for years  ♪
♪ How could I not be worn out? ♪
Recently, Latin American youth have become aware
of the social realities in their own countries.
And they have begun to rebel and join the cause of the working class.
It's a type of rebel song.
[in Spanish] The new Chilean music was very connected to everything new
that was happening in the sixties.
Víctor Jara was the most innovative artist of the time.
♪ We'll free ourselves From domination and misery...  ♪
[Horacio] If you live in a country full of turmoil,
full of worker and student protests,
and you yourself are a part of that struggle,
your songs will reflect the times.
♪ Clean, like fire, is my rifle barrel  ♪
We've had enough of that music that doesn't speak to us,
that entertains us only for a moment, but leaves us empty.
We began to create a new kind of song.
It was music that was born out of total necessity.
[Horacio] One of his most famous songs was "Prayer for the Worker."
It was a great depiction of what we were experiencing in Chile.
♪ Rise up and look at your hands ♪
♪ To grow, reach out to your brother ♪
It gave the feeling that where this country was headed,
would be very dramatic.
♪ In the hour of our death, amen ♪
♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Amen ♪
Allende! Allende!
[male reporter] Doctor Salvador Allende is running for president of Chile.
If he wins, he'll become the first Marxist ever
to be elected democratically.
Allende's campaign is promising to end
what is some of the greatest income inequality in Latin America,
and supports rights for Chile's peasants and workers.
[male reporter 2] The United States opposes the election of Allende
and has warned of the creation of what it calls, "another Cuba."
[Horacio] Like all artists at that time,
we participated intensely in the Popular Unity Movement.
And among us, the one who most proudly carried the flag was Víctor Jara.
♪ Come, come, Come with me ♪
♪ Come, come, Come with me ♪
♪ We'll go down the wide road ♪
♪ To where a new destiny begins ♪
♪ Come ♪
♪ Come, come, Come with me ♪
[Eduardo] During the presidential campaign, we accompanied Allende to many places.
Víctor's songs were the soundtrack for that piece of history.
His music was essential to Allende's victory.
THERE'S NO REVOLUTION WITHOUT SONGS
[Eduardo] Allende said, "there is no revolution without songs."
[reporter, in Spanish] It's official, Salvador Allende has been elected President of Chile.
On the 4th of September 1970,
we were listening to the election news coming over the radio
and we got down to the center and it was like a marvellous carnival.
And strangers were kissing each other, embracing each other, singing, dancing,
all night long.
[speaker, in Spanish] President of the Republic, Comrade Salvador Allende.
[Joan] The world had turned upside down.
There was absolute change, somehow, in human relationships.
And there was a change because
one felt for the first time, the working class in Chile was there, you know?
Or you heard its voice, they were present in everything.
And that was something marvellous.
[female reporter, in Spanish] After helping Allende win the election,
Víctor Jara is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
[Eduardo] He was always very successful.
I don't remember any of Víctor's concerts that didn't end with standing ovations,
and people on their feet asking for more songs.
He had that spiritual connection with the people.
[speaking Spanish] We played music to support Allende as president...
...Then we realized that the right wing opposition to Allende
was getting more aggressive.
Paramilitary groups were forming.
We saw how right wing forces wanted to disrupt society
just because they were losing power.
[Jose] Half the population,
those of us who supported Allende and democracy,
were considered delinquents or suspicious.
If you were stopped by a soldier, you had to prove your innocence.
They would insult us. They would yell at us on the street.
[in Spanish] They're all corrupt degenerates!
These filthy communists should get out of Chile!
And Víctor had several difficult encounters.
One time, he went to sing at a school.
In one song, he denounced a certain minister
who had ordered an offensive that killed many people in the south of Chile.
♪ You must answer why Mr. Pérez Zujovic ♪
♪ Because you responded To defenseless people ♪ ♪ With rifle fire ♪
[Eduardo] And the man's son was there.
He started screaming at Víctor, and what followed was terrible.
They started throwing rocks, it was terrible.
If Víctor hadn't run out, they would have lynched him...
...We knew the times were difficult,
but we thought things would work out.
We never imagined such violence could happen in Chile.
Anyone who has experienced what happened in Chile on the 11th of September,
their life, I think, changes completely. At least mine has.
The 11th of September began as an ordinary day.
My taking the children to school.
When I came back, Víctor was listening to the radio.
[male reporter, in Spanish] The long-rumored coup, today became a reality.
[Joan] We listened and heard of the military operations that had begun to take place.
[radio announcer, in Spanish] People must stay in their places of work,
occupy the factories and prepare for the fight against fascism.
[Joan] The urgent call for all workers to assemble in their place of work,
and Víctor left the house to go to the university,
-it was his place of work... -[civil defense siren]
...about two hours before the bombing of the palace, Moneda Palace.
[male reporter] We're getting reports now from Santiago, Chile,
-that a military coup is underway... -[helicopter]
...President Allende is surrounded in La Moneda Palace and is under attack.
[speaking Spanish] The Air Force has bombed the towers...
...I just addressed the workers.  I will not resign.
I will repay with my life the loyalty of the people...
...It's our history and the people will write it.
Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers!
[female reporter, Spanish] A few minutes ago, President Allende was reported dead.
We were just informed that the leader of the coup is General Pinochet,
Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Armed Forces.
The Armed Forces have acted today solely out of patriotism
to save the country from the chaos
that was caused by the Marxist government of Salvador Allende.
Víctor managed to phone me again in the afternoon, and he said that
he would have to stay in the university because there was already a curfew.
He said how much he loved me,
that I should be brave, said goodbye.
[voice wavers] That was the last time I spoke to him.
[in Spanish] On the morning of the 12th,
we were shocked to see, advancing towards the university,
a company of about a hundred soldiers.
[in Spanish] That's where they arrived with their cannons and their artillery.
Then, with absolutely no warning,
they began machine-gunning the university's central building...
...They got everybody out, putting professors and students on the floor
with hands on their heads. There among them, was Víctor.
Víctor was part of the university's Communications Department...
...Then they began to transfer us to the stadium,
which was called Chile Stadium.
We got off the buses and they started beating us
as they brought us into the stadium...
...There were five or six thousand political prisoners.
We all arrived beaten and injured, bleeding, clothes ripped,
many were barefoot.
Many arrived without pants, in their underwear, dirty and dragged on the floor.
[in Spanish] They took off my clothes.
They left me in my bra and panties.
With their weapons pressed up against me. They searched me.
They touched me everywhere.
I saw so many things there.
They killed a young boy.
He must've been 12 or 13.
A friend of mine climbed up the stairs. He shouted, "Long live Allende!"...
...Then he jumped.
[Osiel] I was in a line. An officer searched the prisoners
and took Víctor Jara out of the line.
The hysterical officer explodes with a furious rage at Víctor. He said,
"You're that motherfucking son of a bitch, Víctor Jara,
singer of communist songs. I'll teach you, asshole, how to sing!"
"You're Víctor Jara! You motherfucker! Sing now, asshole, sing!"
And he beat him.
[Spanish] The soldier raises his machine gun and strikes Víctor hard on the back.
Then another soldier hits him again, making him fall to his knees
almost at the feet of the officer.
Víctor tries to protect his face with his hands.
But when he opens up his hands, one of the officers kicks him,
almost bursting Víctor's eye.
Then, an Air Force officer approaches, smoking,
and flicked his cigarette near Víctor and told him, "Smoke it, asshole!"
Víctor said that he didn't smoke.
The officer yelled, "Smoke it, asshole!"
Faced with this, Víctor, with a... hesitant and trembling hand,
reaches for the cigarette butt...
...The guard smashes his wrists, and says,
"Try playing the guitar now, with your hands like that, you son of a bitch."
[in Spanish] The condition in which I saw Víctor, he was beaten, destroyed inside.
He would try to stand, but kept falling down.
They'd beat him so he'd stay on his feet.
[Boris] The last time we saw Víctor alive was up there on the balcony,
with a bleeding face, looking out at the stadium stands,
at about one or two thousand political prisoners.
Those were his people.
[Osiel, passionately] Víctor was not only shot.
They didn't simply place a gun to his head and shoot. No.
He was murdered in the worst possible way,
tortured to death.
[Boris] With our hands behind our heads,
we were led towards the front of the stadium.
And what we saw was like Dante's Inferno.
There were 20 to 30 cadavers piled up.
And amongst that mountain of corpses was the lifeless body of Víctor Jara.
On the 18th of September,
early in the morning,
a young man came to my house...
...to tell me that Víctor's body had been recognized in the morgue.
I went with him, we entered a side door,
and I saw the city morgue of Santiago, full of hundreds of bodies
of Chilean workers and students, young and old,
some still even with their hands tied behind their back.
All full of machine-gun bullet wounds.
And among these bodies I found Víctor's body.
A very battered, bloody body.
Half naked and full of machine-gun wounds.
His hands... hanging from his wrists, his face bloody.
This was the day that my first life ended.
Little by little, I was obliged to begin a life which was totally different from
all that I had lived until that moment.
From memory of Víctor's body in the morgue, I was able...
to find a voice.
A voice
to accuse, to accuse, to accuse, to give testimony.
I had to take on where they cut Víctor off.
I had to go on running where he was stopped. I had to...
just go on, and to try somehow in a way... I won't say to take his place,
but to take my place in what Víctor was fighting for.
[speaking Spanish] Just a quick word.
I am so touched to know that after so many years,
Víctor's memory continues to live on through all of you.
I've been to the United States.
I've been to Japan. I've been to Australia.
To almost all the countries of Europe.
Where people have wished, somehow, through me, through Víctor,
to the symbol which Víctor is now, to express their concern for Chile.
Joan was determined to bring justice
and to bring the people who were responsible for the death of Víctor
to account. And she spent decades doing that.
She left no stone unturned in her attempt to find justice. FOR THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN PEACE TO VÍCTOR JARA
FOR THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN PEACE TO VÍCTOR JARA I'd instigated
I'd instigated the case of Víctor's murder.
The Armed Forces would give no information about who was responsible.
Nothing happened with that for years... and years...
[softly] and years.
[female reporter] The official numbers are that Pinochet's junta killed over three thousand people
between 1973 and 1990.
There has been protection for the murderers.
There has been a pact of silence between them.
[female reporter] Pinochet was, in the eyes of the world,
one of the most violent dictators of Latin America.
It's the bitterness of injustice in this country.
Those who abused, tortured, and murdered,
for the vast majority, nothing happened to them.
[male reporter] As many as 30 thousand people were victims of human rights abuses
with as many as 27 thousand tortured.
When Augusto Pinochet was arrested, on October 16th, 1998,
it was a game changer in the history of Chile.
[female reporter] Pinochet was arrested in London on torture and genocide charges,
on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge.
The guy whose name was literally synonymous with human rights violations, had been detained.
with human rights violations, had been detained.
His immunity had been broken, his impunity had been shattered...
Hope still exists for his victims and their families
because earlier this month a Chilean judge decided to reopen an investigation
into the death of folk singer Víctor Jara.
The investigation, I gather, was reopened because of about 40 new pieces of evidence
that you were able-- all of you were able to uncover.
For the first few years, there was a great deal of fear about talking, you know.
But now people are willing to talk about their experiences
and what they saw, and who they saw.
The conscripts were people of young age,
erm, 17, 18, who were drafted. They were forced to serve in the military.
Some of the younger conscripts that participated in these atrocities
started to break ranks.
One of them was tied to the Jara case.
José Paredes was the first person to elevate this to the next level
when he identified a lieutenant, Pedro Pablo Barrientos.
Paredes testified that he saw Barrientos shooting Víctor Jara.
[José, speaking Spanish] The guy was all beaten up.
Beaten up good.
[male interviewer] Did they have him sitting, standing, tied up?
No. They had him sitting.
They had some military stretchers. That's where they had him.
And they beat, and beat, and beat him.
-[interviewer] And who shot him? -Barrientos.
How did he shoot him, José?
Nearly at point-blank range.
It was really important because it was the first time someone
It was really important because it was the first time someone in the military was actually admitting to having seen,
and pointing fingers, you know,
and naming the person who killed Víctor Jara.
[Peter] Many Chileans from the Pinochet regime decided to come to the United States as it became
decided to come to the United States as it became clear that the Pinochet regime was coming to an end,
and that the military would not protect them.
These individuals came,  living happily every after, until...
These individuals came,  living happily every after, until... human rights investigators caught up with them.
And that was what happened in the case of Pedro Barrientos.
It was really difficult to find him, initially.
In fact, En La Mira from Chilevision did an investigative special
where they had heard he was in Florida.
Joan went appealing to the public to help them find this man.
The officer, who had taken refuge here, obtained...
North American nationality.
So, the approach of CJA, the Center for Justice and Accountability,
to us was a gift.
We at the Center for Justice and Accountability
were very interested to see if there was any way
we could bring a case against this guy in order to facilitate extradition.
The action that the Jara family brought against Barrientos
was brought as a civil case.
In the United States, we have a particular statute that enables
In the United States, we have a particular statute that enables people who are the victims of torture
to bring actions against the defendants who committed the torture.
We filed the case and we went and met with Paredes,
and talked with him about coming to the United States to testify. And...
he was very credible. We believed him.
We felt strongly that we were in good shape.
Although it was a civil trial, not a criminal trial,
it meant, possibly, the extradition of the criminal
who was directly responsible for Víctor's torture and death.
[man, speaking Spanish] My sister called me and said,
"Listen, Pablo,  a soldier on TV said you killed Víctor Jara."
And my question was, "Who is Víctor Jara? Who is Víctor Jara?"
She told me, "Pedro Pablo, they're seeking your extradition."
I did not kill Víctor Jara. I was not at Chile Stadium.
Everything they say is a lie.
They want me in Chile as a political trophy...
...We were never rich.
But we were rich in the lessons our mother taught us.
My father abandoned me when I was two years old.
And we lived off what the sea provided. We had fish, seafood.
There was always music in our home.
I'd wake up to music because my brothers were always singing.
They were always playing instruments.
On Sundays, we'd go to see the regiment's band
with the soldiers raising the national flag.
I wouldn't miss a single Sunday.
I started military school when I was sixteen.
To start that military regimen, that new way of life,
to leave the city where I lived and go to Santiago alone,
it was like a dream.
[speaking Spanish] I met Pedro Pablo at my home. He came over with a friend.
I was fifteen and he was eighteen.
He was fun. He was polite.
He had personality but he was reserved.
[Barrientos] That period of my life with Maria Teresa was very beautiful.
I went to the Engineering School as a newlywed,
and I left the school as a lieutenant...
...When I had the chance to vote for the president of my country,
I decided to vote for Salvador Allende.
Because his policies were good.
Because I grew up in a place where poverty existed.
All of a sudden, this man shows up and says, "We're going to eliminate poverty."
I thought, "I'm going to be a socialist."
[Maria] During Salvador Allende's time, things became very difficult.
The country had no food. There was nothing.
You had to stand in line for milk.
[speaking Spanish] All this coffee, milk, they are all rationed.
The country began having problems. There were strikes, trucker strikes.
Workers were striking at different factories.
[Spanish] If blood has to flow, then blood will flow. -[gunfire] -[siren]
[Maria] The people were on the streets.
Salvador Allende's speeches became more and more harsh.
[speaking Spanish] We must strengthen the power of the people.
By 73, we were a nation divided.
[Maria] September 10th was a special day.
Soldiers arrived and knocked on our door.
They told us we had to be ready because
we'd probably be going to carry out orders in Santiago.
He gave me a kiss and left.
He said, "I don't know where we're going in Santiago.
I don't know what will happen."
[Barrientos] At 7:30 a.m., we arrived at the armory.
The major told us,
"You're going to need four soldiers from your unit to be bodyguards."
That's when I selected Hinojosa.
[speaking Spanish] I was chosen, along with other soldiers, to be a bodyguard for the major.
[Barrientos] I accompanied Hinojosa as part of the security detail.
We went to the Ministry of Defense.
Around 11 a.m., they started bombing The Moneda Palace...
...We heard on the radio that Allende had died.
Pinochet gave a speech and declared power.
From that moment on, I was always with the major.
[Hinojosa] I was at the Ministry of Defense with my squadron.
We patrolled the sector we were assigned to,
which had an entry and exit base at the armory.
For 24 hours a day, from the 11th to the 16th,
I was with Lieutenant Pedro Pablo Barrientos Núñez.
During that time, we had no order to go to Chile Stadium.
[Barrientos] We were just in one area.
Chile Stadium was very far from the area we patrolled.
I was never at Chile Stadium. What more can I tell you?
I met Lieutenant Barrientos when I joined the army.
Because he was our section commander.
Mr. Paredes accused him directly on TV, even though he was never in Chile Stadium.
Never. Our company never went to Chile Stadium.
Barrientos was never there.
I think all this about placing me at Chile Stadium is easily explained.
First, in that program, En La Mira,
they named me as the person in charge of Chile Stadium.
And when that got repeated time and time again, for weeks,
it began to stick in the minds of the people who, during that time,
were in Chile Stadium.
After that news special, the soldiers began to place me
in Chile Stadium.
When En La Mira aired on TV, I said to my wife,
"Hey, it's nothing but lies. None of that is true."
"Why do you say that?" she asked. "I was there!"
We never went to Chile Stadium.
Not on that date, nor afterwards.
Private Paredes went on En La Mira to implicate me in Víctor Jara's death.
But later he admitted he said it all because he was pressured by police investigators.
because he was pressured by police investigators.
[speaking Spanish] I made up stories. All lies.
I was extremely stressed. Very stressed.
You start to feel like you're cornered,
that you said this, and then you said that.
In the end, you just explode and say,
"My lieutenant, Barrientos, killed him."
I didn't want any more interrogations.
And I held a grudge against him.
When I was his subordinate,
he would beat me a lot.
So when they asked, "Who did it?" "Lieutenant Barrientos!"
And it was never true.
And it was never true.
I swear it before God and my son's grave. It's all lies.
Understanding that we couldn't rely on José Paredes was very hard.
The first feeling is desperation.
What are we going to do?
Where am I going to get the energy to rebuild this strategy?
After Paredes met with us and told us he wasn't going to participate,
Chilean National Police began investigating this case in earnest.
They were able to build a case implicating Barrientos.
But at that point,
we had to question whether we had enough evidence to proceed to trial.
[Almudena] We needed more soldiers that could identify Barrientos in different roles. But they were afraid
in different roles. But they were afraid to testify against Barrientos.
[Pascale] In 1973,
there were a lot of young men doing their mandatory military service.
They were supposed to do it for a year, and the coup happened.
And they were sent to do very horrible things often, and saw horrible things.
These young 18-year-old kids, came out of their parents' house
and to the military and to a coup and to repression and to torture
and to executions.
[Paredes] I feel guilty because I did many things I shouldn't have.
I tortured people, but I was following orders.
To this day,
I suffer.
It pains me.
[in Spanish] I believe there are many more conscripts who know the truth about Víctor.
Officers likely visit them from time to time, and say,
"Don't talk about it. Do not confess."
They're scared to tell the truth about what they saw, what they did,
or what they knew.
They still have a reverential fear of their superior officers.
[Kathy] Barrientos left the country in 1989.
Just as democracy was returning to Chile, he moved to Florida.
[Mark] Barrientos came to the United States, I think,
to prevent having to face justice in Chile.
[Peter] The U.S. is a logical country for many Latin American military officers
to seek refuge in.
We supported them at the time of the coup.
Salvador Allende, he became the first socialist president
to be democratically elected in the world.
And this sent a tremor of fear
[chuckling] through the heart of the United States, under Kissinger and Nixon.
Kissinger wrote to Nixon,
"We have no recourse to oppose his legitimacy because he was elected freely.
We have to make sure that we undermine his ability to govern.
That he does not present the world with a model of success."
And so the CIA was sent by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger
to overthrow Allende, and help bring Pinochet to power.
When I started in the CIA, it wasn't long before I was assigned to Santiago, Chile...
...We were in the struggle to checkmate the communists,
and so we felt the stakes were huge in Chile, at that time.
[Peter] It led to increased contacts with a Chilean military.
It led to a long propaganda effort to supply funds
to Chile's leading right-wing newspaper, El Mercurio,
so that they could become a bullhorn of propaganda and opposition against Allende.
When Allende came to power,
the CIA engaged political action,
but it did not work with the military to conspire to overthrow Allende.
[Peter] We didn't man the tanks,
we didn't pilot the planes that attacked The Moneda Palace,
but we did create the conditions to support
what became one of the most infamous and bloody regimes in Latin American history.
There was reporting coming in about human rights abuses.
And it was clear that an iron hand was used. This was not a bloodless coup.
The U.S. was actually involved
in overthrowing a democratically elected government,
and putting the military in power, and supporting them.
My husband, Charles, an American,
was exploring what had been happening in Chile, as a reporter and as a filmmaker.
Charlie met up with U.S. military people who were
very proud of the success of the coup, and taking some credit for it.
It made Charles very uncomfortable because he knew this was an illegal operation
that they were running.
Charles was arrested.
And after that I went to the consulate and reported that Charles was missing.
Later, I learnt that Charles had been killed in the stadium.
I do not believe that the Chileans would have killed Charlie
unless they had gotten somehow an "Okay" from the U.S. Government.
We did go to Congress and we did testify.
The reaction was, "Gee, that's terrible, it should never happen again,"
however, there wasn't any actual investigation initiated from that...
...Joan and I both feel that the lessons of Chile,
of the human rights crimes, of the terrible job
of prosecuting those crimes, are very important.
For 44 years we've been seeking justice.
It was not my tragedy alone, it was a collective tragedy.
And I was one of the lucky ones to have been able to see my husband dead.
Not like other relatives of the people who had disappeared.
And I dedicated myself to
battering on the shut doors of the judicial system.
Nobody has ever asked for forgiveness for what happened.
[in Spanish] Víctor is more than a man. He is a symbol of many things.
We still don't have justice for Víctor Jara.
And the Jara family, just like many other families,
you know, have spent decades of their lives, on this.
[in Spanish] We must remain calm and remember there is much work ahead.
[Pascale] The crime destroys the life,
but having to spend 40 years of your life seeking justice, also destroys your life.
Joan Jara is admirable.
She's really been relentless, but she's not going to be around forever.
As I'm 90...
it's like a...
a last... effort.
[Almudena] We decided that we can't give up on Joan.
The need for justice remains...
...I need to find all the conscripts that are associated to the Chile Stadium,
and in particular, the days of the torture and killing of Víctor Jara.
So then the whole legal team travel to Chile.
[Mark] We flew down to Chile to look for other witnesses.
That can be a very difficult thing to do.
[Pascale] Conscripts didn't want to get involved.
If you're 60, 70 or 80 years old
and you've never been involved in a legal procedure
for the crimes you've committed, why would you start now collaborating?
[Mark] Almudena was very persuasive in talking to the conscripts
and I think relating to the conscripts.
[Almudena] It was a roller-coaster but eventually I was given the details
by the conscripts.
[speaking Spanish] The night of the 11th, we went to Chile Stadium.
[speaking Spanish] On September 11, they brought us to Santiago, to Chile Stadium.
I can attest that Pedro Pablo Barrientos was at Chile Stadium
the six days we were there.
[Kathy] There were a number of conscripts who could testify
that Barrientos was at the stadium.
At that point,
we had enough evidence to proceed to trial.
[female reporter] Chile's bloody history has found its way to a Florida courtroom,
where Monday morning, a former Chilean military officer is being sued
by the family of Chilean revolutionary folk singer Víctor Jara.
[translating into English] With false witnesses...
[translating] With false arguments...
...because the whole basis for the lawsuit was Conscript Paredes.
[translator] They came in bad faith, persecuting me.
It is a political persecution.
[Kathy] The people who traveled to the U.S.,
to testify, were not the conscripts.
We anticipated that there would be some challenges in terms of
getting people visas,
and so the conscripts, we took all of their testimony by video.
[female interviewer, speaking Spanish] While you were at Chile Stadium, did you see Lieutenant Barrientos?
[in Spanish] Yes.
Barrientos came from the military school with our orders.
I would see him carrying a briefcase.
We knew he was carrying the orders for the day.
[in Spanish] Lieutenant Barrientos was in charge of the group.
He was the ranking officer.
He organized the patrol
and gave the corresponding orders.
I would see Lieutenant Barrientos from my post on the third floor.
Whenever I looked down, he'd be talking to the soldiers.
[female interviewer, in Spanish] How many times did you see Mr. Barrientos at Chile Stadium?
[speaking Spanish] Several times. I can't say how many but...
[Mark] In some cases, the conscripts were saying things that
they did not understand fully the impact of...
...They didn't understand the weight of what they were saying.
"Yeah, I was sure I saw Barrientos, he came in that day.
Yes, I saw him do X, Y, and Z."
They may have thought, "Well, you know, this is just everyday kind of stuff."
[female interviewer] Do you know the two guards who were with him that day?
Yes.
[Mark] Who were they?
Quiroz was there.
[speaking Spanish] You have people giving declarations,
"And you were there." Well, I wasn't there.
What else can I say?
[female interviewer] Do you know someone named Hinojosa? Yes, he was the other bodyguard.
[speaking Spanish] We never went to Chile Stadium with Pedro.
[male reporter, speaking Spanish] Barrientos' former military bodyguards, Hector Hinojosa and Francisco Quiroz,
testified that Lieutenant Pedro Barrientos was never present in Chile Stadium,
but other witnesses claim he was there during those fateful days.
[Mark] Barrientos' alibis were inconsistent
because the conscripts put those alibis at the stadium with them.
They saw them there.
We had so many people who put Barrientos at the stadium.
Based on the evidence, there's no doubt he was there that day,
there's no doubt that he was giving orders.
But we still didn't have a person who saw Barrientos pull the trigger.
That was the witness we did not have.
[speaking Spanish] They had no idea who had been the real material author
of the death of Víctor Jara.
And I told them, "I know. I know who it was."
I joined the Chilean Army in 1978.
I was doing my military service when Barrientos chose me to be his bodyguard.
Barrientos always carried a gun.
And he'd brag that with that gun he had killed Víctor Jara.
[Kathy] Even though Navarrete didn't actually see Barrientos pull the trigger,
he was the witness who could support a material authorship
theory of responsibility, which we think is the right one.
[Mark] Navarrete heard Barrientos brag
about having killed "that communist Víctor Jara" on more than one occasion.
[Barrientos] Private Paredes lied.
And Private Navarrete lied.
No one says I killed Víctor Jara, except for those two,
and they were both pressured by police investigators.
No one else is saying that.
[Maria Barrientos] Our attorney Calderon told me,
"The Jara's and their lawyers have no evidence. None.
And the evidence is on your side."
[Kathy] There's two things that you have to prove in a civil trial.
You have to prove what happened and that the defendant is responsible,
and you also have to prove the impact on the victims.
We were able to present a number of family photographs and
talk about what the family life was like...
...And then we played the song.
[Víctor singing in Spanish] ♪ When I go off to work, I think of you ♪
♪ Through the neighborhood streets ♪ ♪ I think of you... ♪
[Kathy] It was a song about an activist who was singing a song to his wife.
It's a song to Joan...
...I heard from some of the Chileans who were in the gallery,
how moving it was for them that they could hear Víctor's voice
in that courtroom...
...This beautiful voice from beyond the grave was speaking to the jury...
...and that Barrientos had to listen to it.
All that is emotion. Because it even made me emotional.
If someone shows me a man overjoyed, with his daughters,
and I'm shown a lifetime's worth of photos of joy,
that's toying with emotions.
That's not playing fair.
[Kathy] Well, the jury took their time.
So we spent some days waiting, somewhat nervously.
The Jara family was nervous  the first couple of days,
but then they shared with me that they felt the case had been proven.
They knew what had happened.
That, win or lose, they were very satisfied at having had the trial,
um, which, ah...
[voice wavering] Sorry, meant a lot to me.
[female reporter] Forty three years after the shocking murder of Víctor Jara,
a civil court in the United States
has found Pedro Barrientos liable for the brutal killing.
[reporter] Pedro Barrientos was found guilty and made to pay 28 million dollars
to the singer's family.
The jury verdict was one of the largest jury verdicts that year in the U.S.
It was quite significant and it sent a very strong message.
-Happy, in the sense that... -[camera shutters click]
...the... what we've been trying to do
for more than 40 years...
-[camera shutters click] -...today, has for Víctor, become true.
[Barrientos] For political reasons, they have ruined my life.
They've asked for my extradition.
I told you I wouldn't take part in this documentary
unless you promised me a lie detector test.
I need a way to show the world I'm innocent.
The polygraph will determine who's lying and who is telling the truth.
I am not afraid of this because I am innocent.
[examiner, in Spanish] Are you currently in Florida? Yes.
[examiner] Were you at Chile Stadium between the 11th and 16th of September, 1973?
between the 11th and 16th of September, 1973? No.
[examiner] Look, you need to understand that every time you take a deep breath...
-Yes. -...you move.
It's very important that you breathe normally.
Movement is the enemy of the polygraph.
Did you ever torture anyone, before or after
the September 11, 1973 coup in Chile? No.
[examiner] In 1973, did you shoot and kill Víctor Jara?
No.
[examiner] That was the end. You can relax.
[speaking in English] We conducted three charts,
but I had to give him instructions on not to move and take deep breaths, like,
ten times per chart.
So he moved and took deep breaths, like, 30 times throughout the three charts.
On the question related to,
"Have you ever tortured anyone during or after the coup in Chile?",
he showed 99% deception rate.
To the question, "In 1973, did you fire and kill Víctor Jara?"...
he shows a high 97% rate of deception.
[in Spanish] Listen, so I analyzed everything,
and basically what happened was, the results were inconclusive.
They were inconclusive because you were breathing deeply
and moving around a lot.
The computer wasn't able to analyze properly in order to give a result.
Yeah, but is that good or bad?
Well, it's not good or bad, since we can't give you any results-- -No... yeah. -You know?
-No... yeah. -You know?
[speaking English] He ignored my instructions.
In my experiences, that's over 30 years' worth,
people who do this are usually deceptive,
but they throw the test out.
[Maria Barrientos] Hello?
Well, all the results were inconclusive.
It's not good, it's not bad.
What does that mean, "not good, not bad"?
It wasn't clear if I was lying or telling the truth.
Barrientos has been found responsible for the torture and murder of Víctor Jara,
he's charged with those crimes in Chile,
and yet he's still a U.S. citizen enjoying the liberties that U.S. citizens do.
Pedro Barrientos appears to fit Donald Trump's definition
of a "bad hombre." A bad guy
who came to the United States having committed a lot of violent acts,
who lied about those acts,
and who should not be allowed to live peacefully ever after
in the United States.
When I go to sleep,
I always think about...
the injustice that's been committed against me
in relation to the death of Víctor Jara.
I am one of the political trophies that they need in Chile.
I assure you. You won't get me in Chile. I'd rather be dead.
I don't feel any regret because I haven't done anything wrong.
I haven't killed anyone. I haven't mistreated anyone.
[Boris] I remember the day that Víctor was murdered.
I was sitting next to Víctor.
And, sitting there, he said to me, "Loan me paper and a pencil."
And I handed him my notebook,
which had some blank pages, and a pencil.
And Víctor began to write, quickly.
Really focused. Outside, there were noises and screams.
But he was focused, writing, perhaps with the premonition of death...
...When two soldiers came and grabbed him roughly,
Víctor tossed the notebook, I caught it and hid it away.
And in there is the final song,
the final poem of Víctor Jara, that he called "Chile Stadium."
It goes, "My song, how dreadful is your tune,
when I have to sing of horror.
The horror that I am living.
The horror that I am dying. Horror."
He wrote it two hours before he was murdered.
[Joan] For Víctor, I didn't want to talk about his death.
Again.
What I wanted to bring back to Chile was Víctor's life.
-[shouts, whistles] -[Victor] ♪ La la la ... ♪ [Joan] It was amazing for me to feel how people loved him here.
Generation after generation took him as...
as an example.
Sang his songs.
♪ With genocide and napalm ♪
with one exception.
While on his usual route from the city to the country...
he decided to stop for a hitchhiker.
That's my dad...
always picking up strangers.
But this man was different.
He asked to be dropped off at exit 77.
A road to nowhere.
Before leaving, the man passed along a warning--
Beware the Black Flags.
Their only loyalty is to themselves.
He advised my father to gather up supplies and flee.
Find somewhere safe and secluded. Hide out there...
and above all, stay guarded.
So that's exactly what we did.
The Seer. That's what my father called the man.
Since he foresaw the end.
After that...
the Black Flags and other paramilitary groups
began battling one another for supremacy.
Everything in sight was gutted and burned, then left to rot.
Those who avoided getting murdered in the streets...
frequently wound up either starving or freezing to death inside their homes.
One thing all of these people had in common--
They died afraid.
Cold, hungry, and afraid.
Then things got even worse.
One of the remaining paramilitary groups
One of the remaining paramilitary groups succeeded in contaminating the water supply.
A single drop had the capacity to destroy your entire immune system.
That's when all hell broke loose.
Entire cities were erased from existence.
The land that gave birth to heaven's religions was utterly laid to waste.
Those of us who managed to survive had nothing left to hold on to...
nothing except our faith in humanity...
and in each other.
Forget it.
-You know what I mean? -I do.
That's why I'm telling you to forget it.
My dad won't let you near her.
I can't accept that.
I'm going to talk to him. Man to man.
You don't think I'll do it?
Checkmate.
I wasn't paying attention. New game.
Come on play again!
Dad...
Dad!
We've got visitors.
How many? I only saw one.
Get back up there. Be ready to give me cover.
Shuaib! Now is not the time, Jamal.
I'm coming with you. No, you're not.
- Father. - Maryam!
Stop treating me like a child. I can help out there.
I know, sweetheart. No one here is more capable than you.
That's why I need you to stay inside and look after the others.
Two knocks, we're clear. Three, there's a problem.
She's sick. From the water.
Please help me.
I don't like this.
Come here.
Come here! Wait... it's a trap.
She's my daughter's age, damn it. Shuaib, don't unlock the gate.
Please help me.
Or just kill me.
I have to try.
Hold this.
What are you doing, Dad?
Don't worry. He can handle himself. Just cover him.
Shuaib!
Shut the gate the second I'm back in. Shuaib...

If I were you...
I'd stay put.
Lower your gun.
Give me the girl.
Lower your gun, buddy.
-The girl. -I won't ask you again!
Now drop it.
It stays in my hand.
What name do you go by?
None of your business.
Who are you with?
None of your business.
They call me Abu Eissa. And I'm...
a drifter. Affiliated with no one.
So what brings you here?
What do you want?
Water.
I need water.
I'll give you a gallon.
You give me the girl.
I must say... that's very generous of you.
All that beautiful water you've got up there.
And the most you can spare is a gallon? That just won't do.
It's not only for me.
What if I throw in a little gift besides her?
-What? -I've got bullets.
-What? -I've got bullets. As many as you want.
Nine millimeter?
No.
I've got... .22s.
How about 762s?
Afraid not. But I do have...
Chill out, Abu Eissa! Relax a little. I told you, it's a gift.
Wait.
I've got these.
Very useful. Don't need a weapon to trigger them.
Any sort of pin or nail will do.
They create catastrophes.
I have no need for them.
Listen to me. I'll give you three gallons of water.
You give me the girl.
And you and your friends never come back here.
You don't need their permission.
This is just between us.
You're right.
It's just between us.
Shuaib! Get back here!
Can't get a mark on either of them!
Fire!
On the truck!
Shuaib!
Khaled?
Gabba?
Come on, Dad. Move!
Have them throw down their weapons or I'll blow--
You okay? Don't shoot!
I was just passing through.
Heard you fighting.
Chose your side. And what brought you here?
I was looking for shelter.
There are bandits everywhere.
I was just hoping to find some good people.
Are you alone?
Gülbin!
Anyone else?
It's just the two of us.
You mind if I get my knife?
Have you said hello to the guys that shot me?
Gülbin doesn't speak any Arabic.
She's Kurdish, and my Kurdish isn't so good.
But somehow we manage to communicate.
Dad! It's all right.
You're not hurt?
Had you more accuracy, you might have killed my benefactor here.
I thought he was with... I know what you thought.
It's okay.
My name is Shuaib.
That's Qais.
Name's Mussa.
You saved my father?
Thank you.
Please come in.
We can clean up your wound at least.
My son here was captain of his football team.
Top scorer two years running.
God bless him!
I'm sorry for your losses.
We are all on this same path.
Bury the girl first thing tomorrow.
Blood's not mine, don't worry.
Mussa. This is my daughter Maryam.
Hello.
Daoud... draws.
Graphic design and animation, actually. Did some work for TV.
Draws.
Zaineb. Bilal. We have guests.
I'm Mussa. This is Gülbin.
Hey. Welcome.
The palace is vast. Make yourselves comfortable.
What is this place?
Used to be an airplane wings factory.
How long have you been here?
Three hundred eighteen days.
Is everything all right?
You've got something to say?
Mussa.
He should stay with us.
Just Mussa?
Eissa.
We barely know these people.
We don't know this man or his vices.
He saved your life.
What more do you need to know?
Still, we have to be careful.
The world isn't what it used to be.
Being careful didn't stop Mom getting sick from the water.
I did all I could to save her.
We need a better plan than just being careful.
That's what the Seer told us to do, and I have faith in God.
You rely on God, yet you won't plan for the future.
We need to take control of our destiny,
not throw ourselves in the quagmire and accept it as our fate.
That's enough.
You have to understand that... I said that's enough!
Only Kurdish, I'm afraid.
You've done me a favor and I appreciate it.
You're welcome to stay for a couple of nights, but that's all.
Unless you have nowhere else to go.
There are conditions if you stay.
You carry out duties around here just like I ask.
Isn't it customary to let guests eat and rest
Isn't it customary to let guests eat and rest before asking them to make such decisions?
Please.
How did you two meet?
I found her in a deserted neighborhood.
She'd been hiding out there for months, ever since her husband died.
Murdered, actually.
We've stayed together ever since.
It must have been fate that brought us together.
Don't you think?
How was he murdered? Did she tell you?
He was torn apart.
Limb from limb.
Pulled from his body.
By a group of self-proclaimed "soldiers"...
who decided he wasn't worthy of living.
By some miracle, Gülbin managed to escape.
Fortunately, I was the one who eventually found her.
I consider my scars a sign of beauty.
Could you translate?
I was a teacher...
when it all started.
We were taken hostage at our school.
A rebel commander started groping one of the teachers.
So I attacked him.
Three other rebels came in.
They raped me.
Then they poured acid on my face.
But I survived.
If I had known this was the price I'd to pay to remain alive,
I'd do the same thing again... 1,000 times.
I'm a theatre director, or rather... I was. In the old world.
I used to teach my students to empower themselves with love
in order to gain confidence on stage.
If just one of my students were still with us.
To see Raya.
A shining example...
of a person armed with nothing but love.
Who somehow channeled it to fight against all the brutality and hatred out there.
Of course I fell in love with her.
She kindly loved me back.
And after a great deal of pleading and all sorts diplomatic efforts...
our dear friend Shuaib...
finally agreed to marry us off in front of God and His witnesses.
There's something very strange going on here.
What are you talking about?
Gülbin is afraid of Mussa.
How do you know that?
Just watch her. She's always frightened and nervous when he's around.
There's something off about Mussa.
I don't like him. Or the way he stares at everyone.
He saved Dad's life. I know. But we still have to be careful.
We owe him an invitation to stay here. -Do you even know the man?! -It's the right thing to do!
-Do you even know the man?! -It's the right thing to do!
We've done more than enough for them already. I say we--
Maryam.
Mussa has until tomorrow to decide whether or not he wants to stay.
Well, what if Gülbin wants to stay, but is too scared to say so?
You two get some rest.
We'll have our answers tomorrow.
Good night.
The knife.
Can you explain to me why you trust this guy so much?
Can you explain to me why you're such a know-it-all?
As if you know anything.
Idiot.
Call me an idiot again and I'll tell Dad about you and Daoud.
Seriously? What are we, children?
You started it.
And you know I'd never tell Dad.
I hope you liked the food.
Best I've had in a while. Brought me back to the good old days.
Are you more comfortable keeping this knife on you?
Does it make you uncomfortable?
Not really. But as you can see...
we all keep our weapons inside this cabinet.
Which stays locked unless there's a problem.
I'm the only one with a key.
I don't carry a gun. I'm sure you've noticed.
What goes for everyone else here goes for me too.
No.
No.
You're testing me.
Not at all.
Yes, you are.
Because you don't know me.
You see, this knife and I are old friends.
Friends for life, as a matter of fact.
So what's it gonna be fearless leader?
Do you trust me to keep this knife under my pillow?
Or am I the one who has to trust you?
And the next thing I know, you'll be killing me and Gülbin in our sleep.
If I had the slightest intention of killing you...
I'd hardly have fed you dinner.
Unless you wanted to fatten us up like goats before the slaughter.
-Ain't that right? -No, it's not.
And I don't mean to make a test out of this.
It's already done.
Listen to me, Mussa.
Unless you've already made up your mind to settle down here,
you are still a guest under my roof.
And as far as I know, guests are expected to abide by the rules of the house. Your knife goes into the cabinet with the other weapons.
Your knife goes into the cabinet with the other weapons.
And that's final.
I'm just fucking with you, man! Can't you take a joke?
This knife...
is my dearest belonging.
You honestly call yourself a leader of this pack of dumbfucks?
Trust should not simply be given. It should be earned.
Now I know where you keep your food, your water, and your weapons.
Good-bye now...
fearless leader.
The unworthy.
I am the Aleph and the Ya'a.
The beginning and the end.
The time has come to separate the strong from the weak.
The worthy...
from the unworthy.
Qais.
Dad. No!
Let go of her!
Get me something!
A bandage, towel, anything! Daoud...
No. Stay awake.
We're right here with you.
Maryam.
Eissa.
I'm sorry.
No. No. No!
See what happens when you let strangers in?
This is all your fault.
Daoud.
Eissa, dear. Wait.
Eissa! Where are you?
Come out, you bastard!
Come out!
Get out of the way. Move! Where do you think you're going?
What?
What's the matter with you? What's the matter with all of you?
What's going on?
Don't you realize who just got killed? Have you all forgotten who saved you?!
Where are you now? Where are you?! You're not going anywhere!
- I'm gonna kill him. - Not tonight.
I'm gonna kill him! Not tonight you're not!
We need to see to Dad.
Don't worry.
Mussa must be gone by now.
You should get some sleep.
I'm okay.
Stay.
May he rest in peace.
What are we going to do now?
I don't know.
What were we doing before?
My father found a way to keep us safe.
But he didn't plan for the future.
Do you really think he ran away?
Mussa?
I don't know...
I didn't mean what I said yesterday.
It's not your fault.
You're a good man, Eissa.
Father would have laughed hearing you say that.
The world was falling apart all around us,
but your dad still made sure everyone knew you were team captain.
I meant the "man" part.
He never treated me like one. It's men's work you're doing now.
The people inside here are relying on you and your sister.
And so am I.
I'm only alive today thanks to your dad.
Consider me your right hand from now on.
May he rest in peace.
May he rest in peace.
What?
I'll wash them later.
What's wrong?
-What happened to the water? -What do you mean?
We're fucked.
Water's been cut.
Gotta go out to the tower. I'll go with you.
No. I won't let you go out there alone!
Daoud, Qais, let's go. What's wrong?
We're going to the water tower.
Stay here, Qais.
I'll go.
Fine.
Eissa. It's not gonna happen.
One of us has to stay here.
Fine.
You still upset with me?
Don't forget to lock up behind us. Two knocks, we're clear.
Three, there's trouble. Don't worry.
Should we make a run for it?
It won't make a difference.
Save your energy.
Just be ready.
Hold this.
Eissa, wait.
Let me climb.
You don't have to.
Yes, I do.
Carry your weight. That's what your father always said.
This one... is mine.
Just need a little hand here, boys.
Idrees.
Be careful.
Idrees!
Daoud.
Daoud!
Maryam, wait!
Calm down, Daoud.
We have to stop the bleeding.
Is this what Mussa was talking about? Separating the weak from the strong?
What kind of test is this? What's he going do to us? It's not a fucking test.
It's not a fucking test. It's a massacre.
This isn't working. Hand me your belt.
Water... there's none left.
And what if he comes back?
Where do you think you're going?
What are you hiding from us? Tell me! What are you hiding?!
Shut up! Everybody shut up.
If anyone here does so much as raise a hand to anyone else, they're gone.
-Understood? -Why are you so eager to let her stay?
She hasn't given us a reason not to. Eissa! Now is not the time.
What a joke.
The bleeding won't stop.
Get a fire going. Hold him down.
Just stay calm.
Bilal, give us a hand here.
Relax, we're right here with you.
Hold him still.
Eissa! Please don't!
Daoud! I beg you!
I beg you! Cover his eyes.
Please! I'm begging you!
Above the knee.
Trust me.
Hold him still.
Jamal...
You're pathetic.
Save some for Daoud.
I know you don't want to hear this, but... we can't stay here any longer.
And Daoud is in no condition to be moved.
He lost a lot of blood.
Priority should go to those of us who are going to live.
What makes you so sure you're going to live?
Are you threatening me?
Aren't we all going to die?
I'm saying you're selfish.
Exactly.
Selfishness is what it's going to take from now on, sweetheart.
These petty and childish emotions of yours
won't get us through a single week without water.
Get the hell off me! What did I say, Jamal?
She attacked me!
But you didn't see that, did you? I heard the whole thing.
So what? Who put you in charge?
Get out.
So you're giving out orders now, too?
You're not welcome here anymore.
In here, we protect each other. Defend each other.
You want to fight for yourself, do it out there.
Do you really think... you'll last a day here without me?
Huh?
Get out.
What if I don't want to?
Leave now!
We're no longer under your command, Captain.
I think we can all agree that it's more rational for me to be in charge.
Not a kid just hatched from his egg.
First thing I'm doing is...
throwing this bitch out of here.
-Don't you dare touch her. -Get out! Stay back, Eissa!
I'm doing this is for the good of everyone here.
You're not a leader. You'll never be a leader, and you know it.
What do you know?
Do you know... that your father took my council in everything?
Do any of you know that I was the real decision maker?
A true leader has to protect his charges.
Can you do that? Is that so?
Who have you been able to protect?
Certainly not your own father.
Where were you when he got slaughtered right in front of everyone?
Who welcomed the enemy in here with open arms?
Didn't you insist on letting them stay?
And you? Have you forgotten how you got here?
The man who left his family behind to burn?
Shut up, Eissa.
Yet somehow managed to save his books. Wasn't that you?
If you take one more step, I'll blow your brains out.
You're not a leader. You never were. And my dad knew it.
Why are you all looking at me like that?
Are you going to let this boy call the shots?
For what good reason? Because he's Shuaib's son?
I knew it had no bullets. I just wanted to scare him.
We're staying with you, Eissa.
Don't you worry about us, Jamal.
You just look after yourself.
And then there were seven.
What's that supposed to mean?
You took the bait.
Mussa is going to come for you. One by one.
He'll trap you like mice.
Just wait.
You'll be crawling out of this hole looking for water at any moment now.
I'll be seeing you again soon.
Very soon.
Think we did the right thing?
I think Mussa's plan is working.
Maryam.
Jamal's right.
We can't survive here without water.
What about Daoud?
It's going to be hard to take him with us.
So what do we do?
We need a plan.
We have no choice but to look for water.
But I bet that's exactly what Mussa wants us to do.
We need to be prepared for that.
If it's a war he wants...
then a war is what he'll get.
We're doing the right thing. We have no choice.
Ready? Ready.
Eissa.
I'm coming with you.
- What? - You don't have to do this.
Yes, actually, I do.
Maryam.
We're dead tired. Somebody mind taking over the watch?
I can't leave Daoud.
Can we trust her?
Haven't we been doing so already?
Let's go.
Get over here.
The canister.
The gate's open!
Raya.
Raya!
Raya!
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
Jamal is here.
Raya!
Say something!
Can you see a way out?
It's a trap. We can't leave him here.
Why didn't Mussa just kill him?
He wants to use him for something.
For what? Bait?
To get us in here?
Only one way to find out.
Jamal! What happened?
-He cut out his tongue. -I just heard something.
Jamal! Keep quiet!
Dear God, what...
Raya, find us a wrap of some sort.
Shut up, for God's sake!
Calm down!
Eissa.
We can't take him with us.
We'll be done for if we drag him along.
We're not leaving him like this.
Hold him down.
Hold him!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!
Forgive me, Jamal.
Hurry! The fire's spreading fast! Open it!
It's getting closer! Push!
Out of the way!
Hurry.
Hurry!
Give me a hand here.
Come on, Eissa!
Help me.
Raya! Give me your hand! Eissa!
Get closer!
Raya!
Raya!
-Maryam. -Yes?
Can I have some water?
We don't have any. I'm sorry
Bilal?
Maryam.
Your time has come.
Gülbin!
Mar...
Maryam.
-Stay with her. -Where are you going?
You're the only one who can save her.
What the hell do you want from me? I want you to forget the old world.
Abandon the rules that only existed
to force billions of people to live in mediocrity.
Think about all the chaos.
Chaos...
is the greatest gift humanity has ever received.
You have no right to speak for humanity.
Don't you get it?
The Earth was choking to death on useless people.
Worthless people.
Without purpose.
My task...
is to help you understand this.
The choice is yours.
Which one of you gets to live?
Decide.
Maryam! Don't worry!
You're free now, Eissa.
This is the end. As well as the beginning.
Right before I cut out Jamal's tongue, he told me the gun has no bullets.
How do you know he wasn't lying?
Unworthy.
Where's Qais?
He was a good soldier, but his mission is over.
Intelligent. But not a leader.
We don't need more followers.
Why?!
You deserve to live. More than any of the others.
Mussa is supposed to light the fire...
while I stay back and watch.
Who takes charge...
and who waits for others to guide them.
Those who manage to control the situation get to join us.
Truth is, very few succeed.
But I had faith in you. And you didn't disappoint.
You passed the test. Only after he murdered my family.
Because they were weak.
Now the choice is yours.
When I let you go...
you can try to kill me.
Or you can come with me.
We're gathering soon in the Medina.
Join us.
Meet the others.
Let's fix this broken world together.
You're safe now.
My mission isn't over. I have to go.
We'll be waiting for you.
It's where it all begins again.
It was them, wasn't it?
Who are they?
The Ya'a Aleph.
I don't know what that means.
The Aleph and the Ya'a.
The first and the last.
The beginning and the end.
Ya'a.
Aleph.
The end...
and then the beginning.
That was our name.
And our symbol.
You're one of them?
I once believed as they do.
And what is it they believe?
What are they after? They took it as a given that...
the cessation of life as we once knew it was inevitable.
That soon enough mankind would tear itself to pieces.
And that the world would cease to exist.
Their goal...
our goal...
was to sift through the ashes and find survivors.
Survivors who could help rebuild society.
But you left.
At first I was convinced...
what we were doing was noble.
We searched for people of strong faith and empathy.
Those who would not lose their humanity
once the laws and governments fell.
But the more the chaos swelled around us,
the more peoples' values began to change.
As did the qualities we looked for and tested.
I knew I had to leave...
the moment I first heard them use the phrase...
"The worthy."
Your father...
was a kind man.
I warned him...
but he insisted on going back the way he came.
In order to save you and your sister.
My father believed the Seer had all the answers.
He was mistaken.
Aleph Ya'a.
This is your story.
I will meet you in the Medina.
The end of the world might have been yours.
Over 7.000 Spaniards crossed the gate of Mauthausen,
they came from fighting Hitler along with the French,
they came from the misery and hunger of the refugee camps,
they came from the misery and hunger of the refugee camps, they came from losing a civil war...
After being arrested by German troops, Serrano Suñer, a Francoist Minister, took their nationality away.
Serrano Suñer, a Francoist Minister, took their nationality away.
Serrano Suñer, a Francoist Minister, took their nationality away. To the Francoists, they were not even Spaniards.
The Nazis could do with them whatever they wanted...
In Mauthausen, everything is set to impress you.
It is merely a show.
The kapos... They are actors who believe their own character.
If you give a common prisoner a club, he will become a jailer.
Those with green triangles were the first to arrive.
Criminals, rapists, murderers...
The fritzes' spoiled boys.
For the Chief of the Identification Service,
the most important thing is the staging of the show.
Paul Ricken, the eyes of Mauthausen.
He never leaves his Leica behind.
Franz Ziereis, the director of the show.
Mauthausen's supreme commander.
You,
you, you,
you...
The Erkennungsdienst: the identification service.
Two darkrooms and 210 meters used to document
and take pictures of everything happening in the camp.
I quickly realized about it.
They needed photographers there and I turned out to be one.
I did not want to hit anyone nor be hit.
My only choice was being out of the picture.
By the way, I am not this rookie sitting in front of me.
I am already taking part in the show.
It isn't that bad, is it?
I'm doing well.
You know... It will only happen to you if you try to escape.
Here we are prisoners of war. They can't do anything to us.
They took my father.
In a black van?
You have to be careful, boy. Let's see...
If you don't take care of yourself, the rest won't either.
Look, here you will find people from everywhere:
Polish, Russians, criminals, politicians, Germans, Austrians... and Jews.
Austrians... and Jews.
We, the Spaniards, were the first to come.
Look, we are blue triangles.
You know what it means, don't you?
To the fritzes, we are stateless.
Where have they taken him?
Calm down, he was taken to Gusen,
five kilometers away from here, your father will be fine.
Well, in fact, he'll be better than here.
Gusen is like an infirmary and you already know who works in infirmaries.
-Who? -What do you mean "who"?
-Who? -What do you mean "who"? Nurses.
Your father's been very lucky, boy.
I wish Greta could take care of me, or Elsa...
No, Gertrud... Yes, Gertrud has big boobs...
It is much better like this.
I am Francesc Boix.
Anselmo... Anselmo Galván.
Galván, Anselmo.
You know what?
You are one of the first people I'll be photographing here, Anselmo.
There. Up.
Move over.
Why did you lie to the boy?
No one comes back from Gusen alive.
Without hope, that boy won't survive here even five minutes.
What would you know? You arrived only two months ago.
"Nach un Nebel".
Night and...?
Fog. Night and fog.
Who taught you the art of photography?
My father.
Was he a photographer?
A tailor.
On Sundays,
we used to close the doors and windows of the kitchen
and set up a small laboratory.
It's not that bad for a tailor's son.
However, it could be better.
A good photographer must know how to paint with light.
That is cheating.
This is art.
Some pictures have to be touched up,
some others, only the staging. Human beings are malleable.
I like it.
Be careful. It used to turn onlookers to stone.
I like having some artists as references.
I prefer taking pictures of reality.
Reality doesn't exist, Franz.
It all depends on the point of view.
Don't forget it.
Cover the trays.
Yes...
Clear everything up, we will continue later.
Hans?
There he is.
Do you have my stuff?
Follow me.
How much?
Ten.
-Who knows who their owner was... -Now they belong to you.
-Six. -Eight at least.
Not eight.
Ok, ok.
Hurry, load the storage boxes into the truck!
Move, you slackers!
Go!
Change this man for that one. Now!
I've got your stuff.
I didn't take you for a dandy, Valbuena.
What?
One of the big bosses will visit us in a few days.
-Kaltenbrunner? -Aim higher.
Himmler?
Tell the Standartenführer that the prisoners came in a terrible state.
As thin as rakes.
They tried to escape, but we managed to shoot them down.
Has someone touched the bodies?
No.
One spotlight here, another one there.
Here?
They weren't trying to escape.
They were shot from the front.
Boix...
They don't match...
The identification number doesn't match
with the one on the photograph and they are the same person.
Enough! Bring the copies to the Political Office...
Enough! Bring the copies to the Political Office... -But look... -That's what you must do.
-But look... -That's what you must do.
Come on.
Hat on! Hat off!
Squat! On the ground! Squat! Stand up!
The copies of the Gusen escapees.
Can you explain this to me?
Pay attention to the numbers.
He must have changed shirts with someone.
They have also changed the register.
It could have been a mistake...
I'll fix it.
There are many mistakes...
Are you going to report me?
She is fed up with flowers.
Fill in the death certificate of these Polish
and write a condolence letter to the families.
A pearl necklace? She doesn't like wearing jewels from others.
She doesn't like wearing jewels from others. What about a portrait?
A family portrait.
Tomorrow at the Erkennungsdienst.
I could do it.
Your wife would love it.
Your behavior is damaging us. You're a communist, for fuck's sake.
Here I'm an ordinary prisoner.
Yes... and also a communist. The Party speaks through my mouth.
Then the party is paranoid and should brush its teeth more often.
As if you didn't work for them.
Come...
We change the numbers.
The dead won't need them anymore
and the Night and Fog need to change their name.
We save lives.
There are 35 ways of dying in Mauthausen:
a gas chamber, a lethal injection,
torn apart by dogs, cold showers in winter...
But the worst of them is dying by exhaustion on the stairs of death.
We built it with our own hands.
Each step is stained with the blood of a Spaniard.
Cristóbal Rosales, 29 years old, from Madrid,
professional dancer and communist. A Night and Fog.
professional dancer and communist. A Night and Fog. A Nacht und Nebel.
The Nazis want him dead.
And this is José Pino.
33 years old, Catalan, electrician and suffering from tuberculosis.
Both are sentenced to death.
We can save only one of them.
I am José Pino Carballo. I am 33 years old and was born in Barcelona.
I am an electrician, I had two children...
You have two children.
When we leave, you'll visit them and give them your condolences,
but now we should be practical.
Do you do it only with party members?
Only with those we trust. We cannot do it with all of them.
Can you change numbers with a prisoner of Gusen?
Can you get a job for a Night and Fog?
A photograph is made by light,
but we need darkness for the trick to work.
Look, the knocks are for the bubbles not to get stuck to the film.
We put the photographic paper here, look, in the developer.
And you hang it to dry.
-What are you doing here? -We were leaving already.
-Ricken forbids us to be in the lab. -I was just showing the rookie around.
Leave. Leave.
Have you found the mistake, stupid communist Spaniard?
He's officially dead. Even his family has been notified.
Can you explain to me how it happened?
It must have been a mistake from the Rottenführer.
Maybe if...
What is the word...?
...we wrote an apology letter to his family...
Spaniards, right? Do you have a cigarette?
Here you are.
A SS officer never makes mistakes.
Clean it!
You were right... My wife will love them.
If you allow me to say it, Haupsturmführer...
your methods are too... how to say it... too drastic.
We cannot allow them to think that we make mistakes, Oberscharführer.
Have you never been mistaken, Haupsturmführer?
I have not.
And if I ever have, I'll make sure to hide it.
This corpse cannot be left here.
Nobody will believe this man was shot down while escaping.
Take him there.
It is not electrified.
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
You, move faster!
Those at the front of the line only get dirty water
and those at the end, only a small portion, but if you stay here,
in the middle you can get some meat and potatoes.
I have been told that Gusen is a terrible quarry.
They say that so people don't pretend to be ill.
He sends you regards.
Have you seen him?
At the infirmary?
We have seen that prisoners panic in the dark and tend to be unpredictable.
Don't forget to turn on the light.
The other improvements...
Excellent.
In a few minutes, everything is solved.
Fast, effective and clean.
Spaniard!
Stop! There is no need for uniforms. Get in. Get in!
There is no need for uniforms. Get in. Get in!
I thought that the priority was the exploitation of prisoners.
Would you still use a razor even if it's blunt?
Close the door.
What are you stupid Spaniards doing inside?
Spaniards!
Asshole!
"The sacrifice of the Sixth army has not been in vain,
Generals, Officers, Sub-officers and teams they fought shoulder to shoulder until the last cartridge.
they fought shoulder to shoulder until the last cartridge.
They have died so Germany can live".
So?
The Nazis have lost Stalingrad!
Very good news.
And what is going to happen now?
Come on, get back to your places!
And wipe that smile off your faces, God damn it!
Why are you upset?
So far, the Nazis thought they would win the war.
Imagine what could happen if they realize that they can lose it.
It's your turn.
This morning we were ordered to destroy the copies you send us.
Now, we know why.
It cannot happen again, understood?
Yes, sir.
Follow me.
Ziereis has ordered to burn everything.
I will do it.
No, the two of you will be faster.
Destroy everything but the propaganda pictures.
And those from Himmler too, there should be no trace of his visit to the camp.
Understood?
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!
What are you doing?
What are you...?
We can't burn the evidence of what they've done.
If Ricken finds out... If Ricken finds out, I'll know it was you.
You know what the Party does to rats like you?
They cut their balls off and let them bleed to death.
Let me go, for God's sake, let me go.
It's better to use a new negative,
otherwise they'll realize when they burn it.
Stop!
Should not we take what is left in the laboratory?
The others will do it.
Today has been a hard day.
Come on, Franz.
Or would you rather pleasure yourself?
Good afternoon, Magda.
Enjoy, Franz, you've earned it.
Come with me!
Wash yourself.
There is no place for filthy things here.
One comes to have normal sex here on the Reich's account.
It is forbidden to speak or exchange things.
If you break the rules, you'll be sent to the Hole.
You have 20 minutes. Do not waste your time.
Are you Spanish?
Whore, alcoholic, anarchist...
-Whatever you please... -Well, to me...
If you keep working well,
you'll get overtime in here on me.
Understood?
We save lives, not photographs.
We have to hide them in different places,
they aren't important if they are separated.
How do you intend to do it? If they find them they'll shoot us down.
Ok, as you wish.
You aren't my only option. The Party isn't only you.
You'll need people you can trust.
You can trust "el Lejías".
We used to work together before.
They aren't pictures, they are negatives...
Come in! Quickly!
The negatives are easy to hide.
I won't risk my life for some photos.
You lost a brother in here, right, "Lejías"?
We have all lost someone here.
Yes.
Don't they deserve justice?
We have pictures of our murdered comrades,
of Himmler and the leaders of the SS visiting the camp.
We have proof to accuse them.
Do you really want all of this to be forgotten?
Nobody will believe us if we don't do this.
Nobody.
They took me to Ravensbrück.
I was told that I would be free in six months if I became a whore.
I've been here almost a year.
Would you like to do something against the fritzes?
Look, look, look.
Fucking queers.
We are rehearsing a play.
And you are the one responsible for this?
A queer!
Fucking kapo...
What is it about? A drama? A comedy?
-Sorry? -The play you are working on.
A variety show.
The kapo wanted to speak with Ziereis. But I will handle it.
Some entertainment would do us good.
Where do they take them?
That man is Mr. Poschacher. He owns a quarry on the outskirts.
The lucky guys go with him.
Outside there is work and life is better.
-Did you ask him about that? -Yes.
The guy came here voluntarily. He didn't want to go with the Poschacher.
They took him to Gusen early in the morning.
Nurse.
Do you like it?
This isn't yours.
It is now. He won't need it in Gusen.
Take this.
Are you going to buy me off with some cigarettes?
Music helps to raise the spirits.
What do you want?
You owe me one.
He's a green triangle. He can report us. He won't.
I am sure he'll want something in return.
We can't trust him.
I'd rather trust the greedy than the cowards.
Where did you hide them? Calm down, they're safe. The less you know, the better.
Calm down, they're safe. The less you know, the better.
What do you have there?
We have to put the negatives on the granite boxes shipped to Berlin.
I don't think Hitler will be interested in our negatives.
We could divert one of the boxes with a document with a stamp from your office.
-Who would pick up the negatives? -Someone could travel with them.
Within the box? Are you kidding me?
-I'll do it. -It's crazy!
-I'll do it. -It's crazy! It's not that crazy. I'll tell everything happening here.
It's not that crazy. I'll tell everything happening here.
And with evidence.
I'll only take a small part,
but I'll open a tunnel, an exit gate.
And we can send you the rest once you're safe.
I'll need some official documents, some clothes and food...
They got into our barracks.
Shit!
Move! Move! Away!
There he is! Bring him!
The negatives must be taken out of here immediately.
I am not guilty! Not guilty!
We have a plan.
We have an awesome hero.
And we have a good smoke screen.
If the fritzes want some good entertainment, they'll have it.
The box is finally heading to Poland, to the Soviet border.
Put this on, you will look smarter.
I guess that going from prisoner to beggar is a promotion.
You are going to miss me, aren't you?
Thank Bonarewitz for the wigs.
-Break a leg, guys! -Yes!
Let's go, guys, we are about to begin.
Meine Damen und Herren,
mesdames et messieurs,
gentlemen...
and gentlemen...
after an international tour around France...
The fantastic... and awesome company...
La Española!
As a kid I lived in Aragon
And now I am half-German
I hope I will become a Russian
Or even an American
But that cannot be done
What a successful
Career!
Are you leaving? We are on the best part.
I have to make my night rounds.
Pepe! Pepe!
Sing something for Mr. kapo.
If there is a cattle contest
Don't show up
They may get confused
And give you the first prize
What is he saying?
Is he laughing at me?
No, no...
He said that Russians fear you more than Panzers.
Do you smoke?
Here you have.
Thank you.
It's a beautiful night.
I brought sausages, apples...
Damn it, you have set an apartment for me.
A little small.
At least I won't hear Lejías snoring...
Let me tell you a story...
now that we are friends.
Three hundred Dutch Jews arrived here one day.
The SS didn't know what to do with them.
So they decided to have fun.
They made the first one hundred go up the stairs.
You know how slippery that damn thing is.
Thank you.
I was told that Mr. Paco's daughter has started to smoke...
Once they were on top, they told them to wait.
And then... then they let the dogs loose.
The Jews started to run.
They were running down, they stepped on each other,
they slipped, ran over each other,
crushed each other to get down first.
However...
For what? For what?
Thank you.
Not one left alive...
Then they made the next hundred go up.
She always brings tobacco with her even when she's at home with her sister
And only half an hour later
She has smoked all her cigs with her sis...
The stair of death... It's not a bad name.
This is my favorite name.
The skydivers' wall.
Nice, isn't it?
When their father drops his guard,
his wife smokes his cigarettes in the backyard
And since he loves her deeply
He doesn't have any other choice,
but to smoke the butts of the cigarettes.
You didn't understand anything, did you?
Thank you.
I just wanted to tell you how much I liked your show.
So? Are you afraid?
What do you think?
I want to see my son.
He's almost five now. Almost as long as I've been here.
He's in Poland, in an orphanage, I want to see him.
Hans...
I'm sorry, I cannot let you go into that box.
What are you doing?
We can do this the easy way or the hard way.
-Come down, they'll kill us! -I'm already dead.
Alright.
Give them to me. I'll take them with me.
No.
Take it easy. I hate Nazis more than you do.
I'll only show them when I'm safe.
OK, but wait a bit.
Once you're safe, you need to publish an obituary in Der Angriff for Fritz von Stroheim.
in Der Angriff for Fritz von Stroheim.
Fritz von Stroheim.
Then we'll know you're safe and we'll send you the rest.
Besides, it's a good fit.
Yes.
This won't fit you as well.
I've been preparing it for some time.
Trust me.
Miss?
Don't let us down. Remember, Fritz von Stroheim.
You owe me a pack of Lucky Strikes.
How many?
How is that possible? Count again, you idiots!
So? There is one missing?
Good morning.
This is your new home.
Clean and warm.
What?
Nothing. I read the obituaries from the last few days. There is nothing.
He played us. I told you we couldn't trust him.
Von Stroheim will die, trust me.
The one I don't trust is Bonarewitz.
Have faith.
And remember to...
Excuse me, sir.
Did the other prisoners not measure up?
He has an interesting physique, don't you think?
Slightly interesting.
What's different is always more interesting than what's normal.
It depends on the point of view.
No more bad jokes. Stand next to him.
Excuse me?
Stand next to him. I want to take a picture of you with the dwarf.
Like a circus freak.
Perfect, wait a moment. Get dressed!
It's not that bad.
-You speak Spanish? -And German as well.
I'm sorry. I thought you were Russian.
I'm Austrian, Jew... and a language teacher.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry. Being different has its advantages.
The other day they even took me to the brothel.
Where is Boix?
What is the matter?
Come.
Where are we going?
I told you to bring him in through the back.
Today my eldest son is ten.
I heard very good things about your pictures, number 5.185.
Thank you, sir.
Thank Ricken, he recommended you.
It'll be a good memento for my son.
Dress him up.
May I offer you something to eat? Are you hungry? No? Go away!
You can't take a sentimental approach, Mr. Poschacher.
We are at war.
No, of course not. I'm just saying their performance would improve
I'm just saying their performance would improve if they had better conditions.
I wouldn't go against a decision from Berlin of course.
Good.
Please.
Your hand... on her shoulder.
Smile.
Your family is very photogenic.
Would you like a picture of your family alone?
-Just my family? -Yes, your family.
Trudy? Bring Lily.
Excuse me, sir.
I could not help overhearing your conversation with Ziereis.
Could I recommend you... that young man?
-For me? -Yes.
-Leave me alone. -Don't draw attention to us.
I got you an opportunity to get you out of the camp.
I have negatives on me with proof of what they do to us.
I need you to hide them. Help me.
The Eagle, uh?
Look, here. Happy birthday!
It's a nice birthday, isn't it?
I wanted to thank you, sir, for your recommendation.
Beethoven.
Boy!
Hey, young man! Lower your gun!
Boy!
Siegfried!
This is not a toy, Siegfried.
I'll show you how to use it. Come!
Focus on aiming at the center.
Don't let your hand tremble. Shoot only then.
I'm leaving.
Be careful.
German music can sometimes be too... intense.
Do you understand?
Good.
A hunter must learn to shoot moving animals.
Franz... Don't you think he has played enough?
I'm not playing. I'm teaching him how to hunt.
Don't let them trick you. A monkey looks like a person but it's not one.
Now you know how to do it.
Sir,
this boy...
This boy could be useful for Mr. Poschacher's quarry.
If you don't want to be next, don't interfere.
I'm spending lots of money just to maintain them and even then, they keep dropping like flies.
and even then, they keep dropping like flies.
With confidence. Without fear.
He's young. He's a useful prisoner.
-Shoot! -Please, at least leave me this one.
Alright, keep it if you want it so much.
Do it for your father. Please.
Young man, come.
You'll work for the quarry commando.
It's not paid but you'll have a bed to sleep on
and documents as a civilian foreign worker.
-Good morning, Mrs. Pointner. -Good morning, Mr. Poschacher.
Boys, wake up!
Pérez... With this you'll never find a woman.
And who will wash my clothes then?
Ah... blah, blah, blah.
Spanish, right? Welcome. Come.
Can we trust her?
Yeah, yeah. She's one of us.
You can ask her whatever you want.
Sit down.
Move! Go! Faster!
It looks like the fritzes would like some more theater.
Let this punishment be an example.
No one escapes from Mauthausen's concentration camp.
ALL BIRDS ARE IN THE NEST
Music!
Quickly, quickly.
I like it very much, it reminds me of Peter Brueghel.
What a shame, the copies are out of focus.
Son of a bitch.
You'll need to repeat these two.
You're a son of a bitch!
What did you say?
You're worse than them.
I won't tolerate disobedience!
So... You enjoy watching how others kill, don't you?
How others are moved, how they cry, how they suffer...
How... how they fuck.
You're a voyeur who spies on the world through an eyehole. You don't have the balls to do anything. No you don't.
You don't have the balls to do anything. No you don't.
How dare you? Silence now!
Or what?
Come on, shoot!
You only know how to shoot with your damn camera. Come on, shoot!
Pull the trigger!
Immortalize the moment! Come on, Ricken!
Come on!
Come on!
Are you crazy, Franz?
Hit him hard, but not in the face.
Do you know what it means to be hungry?
To have an empty stomach day after day? Without anyone to talk to.
I'm lucky I have the worms.
I talk to them and then I eat them, so that they won't tell anyone.
Francesc, Paco, Franz.
You thought I was a traitor. Valbuena?
You and your friends, you thought I was a traitor.
I'm a hero, I'm a hero because I didn't tell them anything.
You knew nothing... What could you tell them?
Your friend also did it.
On the other side of the hole.
Hans. The one in the box.
He also ended up eating worms.
And you'll do it too, don't worry... You will. You'll do it too.
Have you done it already?
Have you eaten worms?
You know what? -He ate more than worms your friend. -Shut up.
-He ate more than worms your friend. -Shut up.
No, you shut the fuck up and listen to me!
Your friend Hans not only ate worms...
He also ate negatives. Yes... Strips of negatives.
Of course... Negatives don't have proteins. So he ate them from behind.
That's why they didn't find them in the box. He had them inside.
Where are they?
I don't know... Look for them.
Look, look, look, look.
Cold, cold, cold, cold.
Cold. Warm. Hot. Hot. You'll get burned.
Warm. Hot. Hot. You'll get burned.
You got burned.
Where are they?
It was me...
It was me or the worms.
And one can't trust worms...
Because no matter how many you eat...
Then, they'll eat you in the end.
You want them, don't you?
Well, I'm a hero or not?
You're a hero, Valbuena.
A true hero.
Where are they?
Where are the negatives?
I do not know.
If we don't recover those negatives,
I will personally hold you accountable for their loss.
Is that clear?
Tell them what they want.
Are you afraid of getting your hands dirty?
The negatives?
I don't know if it's American or Russian...
but the music on the other side of the Danube sounds heavenly.
No. No. No.
Hurry up! Let's go!
Valbuena...
Gas! Gas!
Valbuena! Gas! Gas!
Hauptsturmführer...
Stop! What the hell is going on?
It's been taken apart.
What should I do with them now?
Come on! Get out!
Get out of there! Come out! Out!
Get out of there! Come out! Out! Out!
On your knees! All on your knees! Down!
But, sir... It is useless to kill us now.
Anyone else have something to say?
You...
Remember I spared your lives.
Get in! Go!
Take me with you! Leave me a weapon!
Back! Go back to the barracks!
Back to the barracks!
Back to the barracks!
The kapos took the weapons the Nazis left behind.
Take this, we have to defend ourselves.
Franz?
I only took pictures.
I haven't killed anyone. You know that.
I immortalize them.
I'm innocent.
I only followed orders.
That's what you'll be judged for.
Tell me, tell me that my work is safe.
Hi.
GREET THE LIBERATING FORCES THE SPANISH ANTIFASCISTS
Hello.
Thank you.
Take a nice picture of us.
Who is this dude?
What's that?
My boyfriend.
Why didn't you knock before coming in?
Why do I have to knock?
Here, you have to knock before coming into the house.
This is my house, I have the keys, I can open the door myself.
How was I supposed to know you guys are doing the dirty?
This is not your home anymore.
Why is this not my home?
The nursing home is your home.
Can you say a whole sentence in Vietnamese?
You pick the good meat to eat
but speak only half-good Vietnamese. It's so annoying.
Who’s his family?
I'm feminine.
He's masculine.
What's his name?
Hello. Harry.
He speaks Vietnamese?
Stop, tell him to shut it.
I don't have a damn idea what he's talking about no matter how much he talks.
He knows I'm Vietnamese, so he learned some words for fun.
But why did you bring him home
and do dirty things with him?
I'm over 18 years old.
I can invite whomever I want.
I have the freedom to do whatever I want.
You can't talk like that.
-Back in Vietnam-- -This is not Vietnam.
You always invade my personal freedom.
But back in Vietnam,
people will laugh in our faces.
They will say that the elders don't know how to teach the kids.
Grandpa, that's why my dad doesn't like Vietnam and left it to come here.
Um, catch the duck.
Translate for him to get the duck.
Grab the duck.
With his hands?
However he can.
Oh God! What kind of boyfriend can't even catch a duck!
Kids, I'm home.
WE ARE GOING TO A PARTY.
The 23rd, sending the kitchen god back to the sky.
No one is home.
Told me to watch the house
but won't let me smoke or drink.
So…
did I come here?
Where are you going?
To the kitchen to do my business.
Where did you get the duck?
I caught it in the lake in the park.
I dropped a piece of bread, they came running, and I grabbed one.
You stole it?
Nope.
I would never do that.
This doesn't count as stealing.
This is from Mother Nature. Whoever caught it can eat it.
You're breaking the law.
That action is naughty.
You have to return it to the park.
What's that?
You have to return the duck to the city.
Oh my gosh, kid,
this city is so rich.
Just one duck wouldn't matter.
You wouldn't know it, but when I was young, I had a flock of ducks.
I was poor, but whoever wanted to eat duck,
they would just ask, and I would give them one.
You don't understand.
Nobody knew I took it.
Do you want me to call the police?
Why are you calling the police over a duck?
You see?
He's not even family,
but he still laughs when he knows I caught it.
Grandpa!
Oh, you're afraid I'll cut its throat?
No, who can be so cruel?
To make the blood jelly, you just have to cut its mouth, and blood will burst out.
Grandpa!
You sit there for me.
Nguyen!
Um… where's your dad?
At work, not home.
Why do you talk to elders without respect?
Why did he go to work today?
Why wouldn’t he go to work today?
Today is an important day.
Every day is important to you.
You are Mr. Serious.
What do you mean?
Like… serious.
Why is there no food?
Just this cake?
Who bought it?
That? I made it.
What?
You made this cake?
Yeah.
Good.
You're so good.
You're like your grandma.
Back then, your grandma was the best baker in the village.
She could make all kinds of cake.
It's pretty.
Hey,
so you remember what today is too?
Of course. Today is an important day.
Correct.
Today is a very important day.
Today is…
…your grandma's death anniversary.
What?
What?
My boyfriend's birthday?
Oh.
Trot quot.
What is trot quot?
It means it's unrelated.
You only met Harry today. How could you know it's his birthday?
Honey…
Are you tired?
You get tired every time you're mad?
Are you mad at me?
Hello…
Hello?
Can I talk to Mr. Nam?
Damn, wrong number.
Gotcha.
But it's correct?
Is that Mr. Nam?
Wrong…
I'm eat already.
Damn you.
It's me, man.
Speak Vietnamese, dammit.
You scared me.
What do you want?
Come over.
Hmm, I'm busy. So busy.
What are you busy with? Hurry up and come over.
Oh, okay.
My English is amazing.
Hello?
Are you trying to speak English again?
Who’s calling you?
It's probably Mr. Nam.
But he's speaking English.
Can you speak a lot of English to scare him?
-Grandpa? -Yes?
I want to talk to you about something serious.
Nothing is more serious than today being your grandma's death anniversary,
and your dad is not home.
The nursing home called. They said you escaped.
-What? -They said you left without permission.
Damn it.
It's so chatty for a foreign hospital.
Even more than the Vietnamese ones.
I just got home, and they rat me out already?
Did they call the police to put me back in there?
You left without telling anyone.
You made everyone worry. You're in the wrong.
My dear,
it's so sad in there.
Every day, they give me shots,
on the left arm in the morning,
the right arm in the afternoon.
When I'm getting ready for bed, they'll shoot one at my ass.
After a while, me being there
is like being in a mental clinic.
Bus, wait.
Hey! Stop, bus!
Hi is chào, sir is ông,
bà is madam,
go is đi…
Hey!
I want… a ride… a ride.
A ride.
The damn paper is gone.
Get in, you old man.
You know Vietnamese?
It's me.
Hurry up.
What are you doing wandering out here?
-Did you break out? -No.
I asked for permission.
Why is your kid not picking you up
but letting you walk around like a homeless person?
What is a homeless person?
A beggar.
I took the clinic's bus,
but I needed to pee.
I got down to pee, and it left me there.
That's cruel.
Why is your kid not picking you up?
They are busy, so they rented a car for me.
Your kids are amazing.
My son Nguyen just got a new job.
It pays well,
but he's so busy.
So I told him not to come,
that I could get home myself.
When we're here, we have to be independent,
so we don't bother the kids.
Independent? You speak English like a two-year-old.
I've only been here for a year.
You've been here longer.
Also, it's hard to learn at this age.
You're so dumb. You have to write it down, then read it when you forget it.
I did.
Where is it?
Gone with the damn wind.
Gosh.
You're so old. Why did you come to suffer?
To make the kids happy.
Are they happy though?
Looking at these ducks, I miss the duck pond in our village.
Yeah, looking at this makes me crave…
Crave going home, right?
Crave for blood jelly.
Damn.
You just like to kick me while I'm down, don't you?
I'm not lying though.
I'm going to the market now.
Do you need anything?
My son already bought everything.
I know you're rich, you have money,
but you still have to teach your children
the traditions of our country.
So damn tiring. You're ancient.
I don't think they even remember what today is.
I tried to be nice, but you're just a jerk.
If you're free tonight, come over.
We can talk about the old times.
Talk about old times or fight?
We'll talk about old times. I won't fight.
I have a surprise for you too.
Okay. I'm off now.
Damn, I'm still craving it when looking at the ducks.
Bye-bye.
…you left without telling anyone. You're in the wrong, you know?
I know…
but please,
let me stay at home, just for today,
so I can celebrate your grandma's death anniversary
and send the kitchen god away.
I promise you, tomorrow morning, I'll go back there.
I'll go by myself. You don't have to drive me.
I can take the bus.
Please.
I'll allow you.
Did you hear that?
Here, you have to get permission from your grandchild.
It's not like in our country.
Tam,
can I borrow your cake?
What for, Grandpa?
I want to celebrate your grandma.
There's nothing else.
But I made the cake for my boyfriend.
Don't worry.
We celebrate the dead first, then the living.
-Right? -Stop.
When I say no, it means I don't agree.
If you're still taking it, you are…
Are what? I'm on your land, so I'm sweet-talking you.
If you were in my country, I could just whoop your ass.
You're purloining my property.
Purloin what now?
I'm your grandpa.
I'll call the police.
Hey, put that down.
You put it down and step away, and I'll put it down.
You step down and I will put it away.
Wait. You step away, and I'll put it down.
Let's do it together.
Do it together?
Ha, that's my granddaughter.
Okay.
I'll count, then we'll do it together.
One. Two. Three.
Put it down.
I just needed to borrow it… Wouldn't even let me…
-Mr. Nam. -Yes?
He left without telling anyone at the nursing home.
-What? -Yeah.
Can you help me to look after him?
I'll watch him.
No worries.
Hey, you lied.
You broke out, didn't you?
Huh?
No, I didn't.
I did ask for permission.
I wrote a very long letter and left it there.
In what language did you write your letter?
I'm Vietnamese, so of course it was in Vietnamese.
What kind of question is that?
Oh my gosh,
Tammy is right.
You're getting worse.
Hey.
Hey, let's travel together.
No, thank you.
What do you mean travel?
We don't have money.
And it's freezing cold outside. Where would we go?
I'll take you somewhere far, far away.
Forget it. You can't even take care of yourself, let alone me.
Okay, turn to your left.
Damn, you have mental problems.
What problem?
You don't even know right and left.
Your left.
You have to clarify.
Okay, close your eyes.
I have to close my eyes too?
You can only open them when I say so.
Okay.
Are you done yet?
This is like playing hide-and-seek.
Tu…
Nam.
Oh my God!
What is this?
Do you remember…
where this is?
This is our hometown.
This is the bridge we crossed every day.
Back then, you skipped school a lot…
but in here, I still drew all of us.
Tu Lanh, that's my kite.
Okay, let me help you up.
Okay.
I got it.
Give me back my kite.
I got the kite.
Nam Trieu, give it back to me.
Nam Trieu!
Nam Trieu, give it back to me.
Ut, wanna fly the kite?
Where's Tu Lanh?
Nam Trieu, give me the kite.
Here, come and take it.
I saw you. So small and pale.
You can't swim.
The shirt, the shirt, help me get the shirt.
What were you thinking, letting a dragonfly bite your belly button?
You fell into the water and almost drowned.
You were so smart.
Oh, do you remember? When you were reaching for the kite,
it was tiny.
Tiny but sexy.
How about now?
Not so sexy anymore.
Where did you get this?
Oh…
They were throwing these out at the hospital.
I asked for them
and drew on them with coal.
And behind that bush was where
we saw each other every morning and talked about life.
Hey, yesterday, Ut Trong asked when I'm getting married.
Why?
You mean she likes you?
Hey, that's a lot of hope for such a tiny thing.
I'm bigger than you.
Wait and see. I'll be bigger than you.
That's Ut Trong.
You liar.
Damn you.
Where did it go? One look at her, and it tries to hide itself.
Yours is gone as well.
We're doing this with a cake?
Tam made this for her grandma.
Very meaningful.
What?
Why does it say, "Happy Birthday, Honey!"?
Maybe she got the wrong one.
Wrong?
You can be wrong, but she lives here.
How can she mess up death and birth?
Okay, I'll ask you then. You have been here long enough.
What's a death anniversary? Can you fix it for me?
Yeah, right.
I've been here for years,
and I've never seen that word in English.
You can only talk the talk.
I've prepared this.
Can I borrow the lighter?
Today,
if she knows we are
both here remembering her,
she will be really happy.
She was always happy with me.
It only got worse when you showed up.
Hand me the lighter.
-Lighting the candles? -Yeah.
Let me.
-Let me. -Let me.
Here.
This one is small. It's yours.
The big one is mine.
Hey, Ut…
Here.
Why is it so big, Dad?
I thought people usually light small candles.
You stinky mouth.
Small candles are for the dead.
The big ones are to ask for approval blessings
from the ancestors for your marriage. Understand?
-Yes, Dad. -Here.
Once you're married, you have to focus on working
and taking care of your wife. Stop wandering around doing nothing.
Yes, Dad.
Yesterday, Nam Trieu's family proposed to me.
I know.
Did you agree?
My parents did.
Then I don't have a chance.
You should marry him.
Don't be with a nothing man,
just singing here and there like me.
What a very true statement.
I didn't hear anything from you,
and they came first.
If you had said something sooner,
things wouldn't have turned out like this…
I'm not like him, so wealthy. I can't get anything I want
and not care about other people's feelings.
Can you play the song for me one last time?
I hope you will find someone better than me.
I owe you in this life.
Ut…
Damn it.
He can't swim.
I will only love you in this life.
Tu, Tu!
Tu, wake up.
Let me.
Let me, let me.
-Wake up, Tu Lanh. -Tu.
Tu.
Okay, no mouth-to-mouth needed then.
Looks can be deceiving.
Why didn't you say this earlier?
Huh?
I've already talked to their family.
Now he's saying he doesn't want it?
Our son wants to go to school.
He doesn't want to get married yet.
And he said Ut Trong is not the one for him.
You're spoiling him, giving him everything he wants.
She's someone's daughter.
You can't say that you want her then that you don't her.
Where is he? Tell him to come here.
You're so angry right now.
How could he come out and see you?
Here, have a drink.
I'll let you take care of this yourself.
Oh my God.
I can't do this by myself…
I don't care.
It's all on us now.
How can we look at them with him like this?
Hey, Ut,
when I was young, I couldn't light the big candles.
Now, I'm lighting the little ones when I'm not little anymore.
I was happier to light the big ones.
The little ones are depressing.
You're a smart ass.
Where's Tammy?
Tell her to come here. She can represent her father.
If you're my friend,
can you not mention that?
Besides,
she was born here.
She wouldn't know anything about it.
Wait,
why do I only have two, and you have four incense sticks?
It's just praying. Do you really have to compete with me?
-I miscounted. -No, thank you.
I don't use spare parts.
Nguyen is such a bad child for not being home for this.
I already told you,
he's busy at work.
He'll be home tonight.
Honey…
But we're doing this at noon, not at night.
Can you please
let me talk to her?
Sorry.
This…
Honey,
if you can hear me,
can you come here…
you…
I told her to come here…
How could she come, right…
Do you think I'm crazy?
I've known that for a long time. How could she come?
She doesn't have a visa.
If you can hear me,
can you look at me?
Nam and I,
two brothers
in a foreign land,
lighting candles, thinking about you.
Ut.
He gave you all his heart, darling.
He gave you all his heart, ma'am.
Gave you all his heart, ma'am.
I heard you.
Come see for yourself.
She was really mean to me.
She talked about me a lot?
Shut up.
Let me tell you.
Promise me you'll go live with our son.
We'll wait till you get strong enough,
then we'll go together.
I left money in the rice barrel.
If anything happens to me,
you should go be with our son.
As promised, I'll go live with our son.
I don't know when I can visit you next.
You're so mean.
She made me sell all that we had to come here,
and she passed before we left.
As she asked me to, I came here,
but I can't be with my family.
I was put in a mental clinic.
Don't be so sad.
Tu,
why don't you sing her the old song?
What song?
"Da co hoai lang".
I don't remember any of it.
I forgot it all.
You forgot, but I remember.
Back then,
you were dirt poor…
And your family was the wealthiest.
You had nothing that I didn't have.
Oh, my husband
With your sword You went to answer the king's call
I wait restlessly for news of you
Staying up all night
As I await for news of you
All my being hurts
Though the long road May have much temptation
Please don't betray our love
All night, I wait for news of you
All day, I'm a statue full of sadness
All day, I'm a statue full of sadness That waits for news of you
Why the betrayal
Oh my love, do you know
Sadness is my only friend
On nights, I think about our happy days
This love of mine
I pray for you
Safety
Please quickly come home
So two halves can be one again
Today is the anniversary of her death. She has her granddaughter's cake,
joss paper from her husband.
She must be really happy.
Even more so with her almost-husband here.
Hey, that's mean.
Grandpa, Mr. Nam…
You wanna burn the house down?
Damn, you see?
I asked you to look after him for me. Why are you doing this?
I'm sorry. I know it's wrong,
but today is your grandma's death anniversary.
We should spoil him a little bit.
These old guys are wrong.
Grandpa…
I said no, but you still purloin my cake?
I know that I'm wrong,
but I wanted to show your grandma
the cake you made.
You are getting more and more crazy.
Two crazy old men.
Hanging this up too?
Hey, we have guests here.
You have to watch your language.
I know I'm wrong.
I apologized,
but you can't talk to elders like that.
I could've whooped your ass.
Why do you keep wanting to beat me?
Children have to obey adults.
That's the Vietnamese tradition.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
What?
You wanna call the police?
Call them.
Dial the number
and call them.
I'd rather have the police take me away
than stay here and hear my granddaughter yelling at me.
Tu,
her Vietnamese isn't so good, so things are sounding more serious.
Let it go.
Tam… is the name your grandma gave you.
My Tam…
represents the beauty of your soul.
She wanted to have a chance to meet you,
but she didn't get it.
I wanted to show her the cake,
so she could see
that you're a good girl.
I didn't know it would bother you.
Tam, ever since I came here,
I've bothered you so much, haven't I?
You asked me,
so can I say what I really think?
Go ahead.
When you were in Vietnam,
my dad had to work
to send you money.
I know.
He worked very hard.
But every month, when he sent the money,
my parents would fight.
Did you know that?
No.
Because he was trying to bring you here, my parents fought all day,
then they broke up.
Did you know that?
Then once you got here,
he had to spend money to put you in the nursing home,
so you could be taken care of and be close to Mr. Nam,
but you always break out. It's so annoying.
Ever since I got here,
I've done everything that your father told me to do.
He told me to go live there,
that I would be taken care of
for free.
It's not free.
It's very expensive.
Is that right, Nam?
Yeah, it's very expensive.
All my kids have to chip in to send me there.
Why didn't you tell me?
Nguyen forbid me to.
He's worried that you wouldn't want to spend the money,
and he can't take care of you if you stay at home.
He also said that Tammy is afraid of you.
I saw that in your dad's diary.
He wrote that you're scared of me.
Why?
See? You even read my dad's diary.
You always violate other's personal privacy.
Because he's my son.
I have the right to try to understand him,
why he is rejecting his home country.
Over here, people stay out of other's privacy.
He knows it. Why don’t you?
Tam,
thank you for telling me.
I've sensed
for a while that
something is not right.
Today,
on your grandma's death anniversary,
in front of her,
tell me everything you think about me.
Everything.
If she tells you, can you handle it?
I have to. It will happen
sooner or later.
Go ahead.
I give you permission.
I'm scared of you.
But I care about you.
You're not like my friends' grandparents.
You're weird.
You came into my room when I was sleeping.
What did you wanna do to me?
I'm your granddaughter.
When she sleeps,
she usually forgets to close the windows.
I was worried she was going to get cold.
It's normal to take care of your grandchild
back home, right, Nam?
But I never knew you before.
I've only known you since you arrived here.
I don't feel close to you.
You talk about your home country?
What is it?
All you talk about the home country is totally strange to me.
Totally strange to me.
Since my dad started talking about you, my whole family changed.
Did you know that
because all you talk about is back home,
my dad has to work two jobs
to try to make enough money to take you back home?
He works so late.
And you blame him too.
Thank you.
Thank you for telling me this.
Where are you going?
It's freezing cold outside.
Did you not hear her?
This is not my place.
Nam,
can you please let me stay at your place for just one night?
Okay, let me take you there.
Where are you going?
The nursing home will come to pick you up tomorrow.
Wait for me outside. I'll be out in a moment.
Okay.
Tammy,
when you calm down,
read your dad's diary.
Read so you will know why he doesn't talk about back home.
I'm sorry,
I read the diary too.
After you read it, you'll understand your grandpa.
Okay. Let's go.
-I admit it, you're good. -Why?
You have a wide network. You even have friends in alleys.
It's so cold out.
Why are you taking me up here?
Every year on this day, I can see the S from here.
There has to be snow to see it. God is mean like that.
Don’t you fool me.
It's freezing here. Why would I fool you to suffer with you?
You have to be up here to see the S.
Get up here.
No, you go first.
When we were young, you told me to go up first,
then you ran away.
That was a long time ago.
Now, we’re old, and it's cold, I don't have time to play with you.
Be careful.
I know.
Where is my letter S?
You have to wait for the snow to melt.
See that green patch? That's the S.
Oh.
-Nam. -Huh?
I'm cold.
Can you give me some alcohol?
In the nursing home,
we don't get to smoke or drink. So dull.
Since we're already here,
let's make it worthwhile.
-Nam. -What now?
Give me a smoke.
You still smoke tobacco, even in this country?
It's not tobacco.
This is illegal.
I'll be honest with you.
Smoking this helps with the homesickness.
-Really? -Really.
Okay.
Let's go down.
You look weak.
Probably you can't stand the cold.
Please, Nam.
We worked hard to get up here.
Let's wait.
Maybe the snow will melt,
and I'll see my S.
You'll melt before the snow.
Let's go home.
-Nam. -Yeah?
Can you be a good friend and be on my side this time?
Let's find a hiding spot.
Is Grandpa here?
Where is he?
-He went to Mr. Nam's house. -Did you guys fight?
But I can't understand him.
Mr. Nam said that if I read this, I'll understand him.
I'll see that Vietnam is not bad like you said, but…
But…
because I'm guilty towards them.
But Dad, aren't you mad that
Mr. Nam and Grandpa stole and read your diary?
It's not like that.
Back home, sometimes,
when the elders' love for their children is so much,
they'd like to get involved in their kid's personal lives.
It's normal.
So am I wrong, or is Grandpa's wrong?
You're not wrong,
and neither is your grandpa.
You are just different.
Maybe…
I'm the one at fault.
Have you read it yet?
But I want to know the truth.
Nam, why does this smell weird?
-Weird, right? -Yeah.
But you're feeling good, right?
Cruel, inhumane bastard.
Here you go.
Why?
It's just a smoke. Why are you swearing at me?
I'm not swearing at you.
-I'm swearing at the snow. -What now?
Snow.
What?
Form is temporary, class is permanent.
I've always had class.
You're crazy with class.
What?
The day Dad arrived,
he gave me a lot of money.
That's all the money
I've sent him,
plus what they got for selling everything they had.
He said…
He said they wanted to save this for Tammy's college.
I didn't expect this.
They saved all of it.
Even when Mom was sick,
they didn't touch the money.
Not a single night goes by
that I don't dream about that time.
First, everyone got on the boats.
Your mom was pregnant with you then.
The boat got out of territorial water
and kept going for three, four days.
There was nothing around but the sea and the sky.
That night,
there was a storm.
Luckily, the boat didn't sink.
But it wasn't a boat anymore.
It was a casket filled with hundreds of people
dying from thirst and hunger.
We were lost
and desperate.
Some people died.
They got tied to planks
and were thrown into the sea.
I didn't know when my time would come.
The next morning,
a large ship appeared
and towed us to a nearby island.
They didn't take us in, but they gave us water and food.
Accidentally,
I overheard them discussing with each other
that they were going to rob and rape everyone
and sink the boat after taking us back to the ocean.
I took your mom's hand
and quietly ran into a nearby forest.
I saw people walking to their deaths
without any idea.
I…
I killed people with my silence.
Ever since then,
I've been scared of anything that belongs to our country.
I didn't want you to be Vietnamese
because I was worried someone would take their revenge on you.
I wanted to bury everything.
But the more I try to forget,
the more I miss home.
This is…
your grandpa's handwriting.
What did he write?
Nguyen, everything will pass.
Your mom wants you to take your daughter back home one day,
so she can climb on the starfruit tree like you did when you were young.
But it is so far away. I don't know when you can.
Nguyen,
I forgive you.
I understand how you felt then.
If I have a wish,
with God and karma,
I want to take all your guilt.
I will always keep your secret.
But please don't take home away from your child.
And you should…
forgive yourself too.
Hey.
-Nam. -Huh?
That's a kite.
-Nam. A kite. -What?
-Where? What kite? -A kite.
-A kite. -Hey, hey,
be careful. You'll fall like you did when you were a kid.
Nam,
the kite is flying.
What?
When my Nguyen was young,
he was the best at flying kites.
I just saw a kite.
Grandma,
I'm My Tam,
daughter of my father Nguyen.
Thank you for naming me
and giving me money for college.
I'm very grateful.
-Nam. -Yes?
I wanna go.
I've been waiting for this.
Let's go home.
I want to go back home.
Back home?
It's easier said than done.
Nam. I can see
her coming to greet me
just when I reach the village.
She said I owe you.
With just a song,
I got to marry her.
Nam.
What?
How about…
you sing for us?
Nah,
I can't sing.
If I could, she wouldn't have chosen you.
She said
you tried to learn to sing,
but you were a slower learner than me,
so I got her.
Nam.
What now?
Sing for us.
I'm embarrassed.
But why?
She told you to sing.
Really?
Oh, my husband
With your sword You went to answer the king's call
Sing more.
I wait restlessly for news of you
Staying up all night
As I await for news of you
All my being hurts
Though the long road May have much temptation
Please don't betray our love
All night, I wait for news of you
All day, I'm a statue
Full of sadness
Full of sadness That waits
For news of you
Why the betrayal
What comes next?
Can you remind me?
Tu…
Tu,
are you okay?
Tu?
Tu? Are you okay?
Tu.
Why did you cheat?
You left me for home.
Tu…
Grandpa, I understand you now.
Dad, Dad!
Can you hear it?
-Mr. Nam. -Dad.
-Let's forgive them. -Dad.
Your grandpa has forgiven you.

‎You have to read it! ‎I chose it because it ends well.
‎Here. ‎Take this as well.
‎I can't take sweets with me!
‎Since when do you talk back to me?
‎Goodbye, mummy.
‎Come on, give me the bag.
‎Samy, we're going to be late, my boy.

‎BASED ON THE NOVEL BY
‎Don't you want me to wait for you?
‎It's OK, I'll find someone to drop me off.
‎Samy.
‎Try to go all the way this time.
‎It's six o'clock on Radio Nomad
‎and welcome to Seine-Saint-Denis,
‎where all the kings of France are buried
‎along with the dreams of a bunch of kids ‎from round here.
‎We have an exceptional guest ‎this morning, Max!
‎Yes, Samy, soon to be the furthest out ‎black guy on the planet is with us!
‎He'll be the first guy from the estate ‎to climb the Himalayas.
‎The Himalayas in Nepal, ‎nothing to do with the hookah bar!
‎-Hi, Samy! ‎-Hi.
‎Closer to the mic, buddy.
‎So you're going from the highest block ‎in the neighborhood
‎to the world's highest mountain?
‎You could have started with block C!
‎It does seem a bit extreme, ‎but I've been training.
‎He's been walking up ‎15 flights of stairs for 26 years
‎because the lift is broken!
‎I've been taking the stairs for a while, ‎I can feel it in my legs. ‎You know mount Everest is 29,029 ft tall,
‎You know mount Everest is 29,029 ft tall, ‎which makes a 2,528-floor building!
‎How's that for stairs? ‎Jokes aside!
‎That kind of trip costs a load, right?
‎Mittens, your three-ton bag, ‎is one of your cousins in there?
‎How did you manage?
‎-Parents? Friends? ‎-Selling dope?
‎No way. ‎No, I'm from a modest family, no secret.
‎I tried banks. ‎Banks?
‎BANK CREDIT AND INSURANCE
‎A Senegalese asking ‎to go to the mountains,
‎they thought it was a prank.
‎How did you manage?
‎I went to see a sponsor who understood me.
‎How much?
‎All together? 40 000?
‎Thirty-eight?
‎I want to see my logo ‎all over your clothes, even your pants.
‎Given the weather up there, ‎I won't be in my pants much.
‎And it seems you apparently have ‎another sponsor?
‎Yeah, you, Radio Nomad.
‎We're taking you ‎to the rooftop of the world.
‎We've given Samy ‎an unlimited mobile package ‎so he can call us to share his adventure.
‎so he can call us to share his adventure.
‎So Samy, what do you say?
‎Thank you, Radio Nomad!
‎Oh, he's happy!
‎I'd like to ask you the question ‎everyone's asking themselves.
‎Why are you doing this?
‎People often say we're good for nothing.
‎For once I want to be good for something.
‎That's beautiful. Sounds like a pop song.
‎Isn't there something else?
‎I'm doing it for myself, ‎my family, my neighborhood,
‎and for someone I care about.
‎-So there's a girl! ‎-Max!
‎Can we have her name?
‎Nadia.
‎You were supposed to pick me up.
‎There was a problem with the car.
‎Shall we kiss cheeks?
‎-How are you? ‎-Good, and you?
‎Are you taking me to Fouquet's?
‎No, I'm joking. ‎Anything but McDonald's.
‎That would be crazy! ‎Making me take the metro's crazy.
‎-The car... ‎-Come on, you can tell me over food.
‎Wait, you know...
‎The guy's been trying ‎to pick her up every day for six months.
‎Then Samira ends up asking ‎"haven't you noticed anything?"
‎and what does he answer? ‎"Did you cut your hair?," he says.
‎"Did you cut your hair?," he says. ‎Her hair is like silk, see. ‎She answers "no," ‎she puts her hands on her boobs,
‎She answers "no," ‎she puts her hands on her boobs, ‎moves them around and says ‎"I got a boob job, mate,
‎"I got a boob job, mate, ‎look well because it's the last time ‎you're seeing them."
‎look well because it's the last time ‎you're seeing them."
‎-Can you imagine? ‎-That's full on.
‎She left him standing there.
‎The guy's been crying for three weeks, ‎she hasn't given in.
‎-The bastard. ‎-No, she hasn't given in for three weeks.
‎-The bastard. ‎-No, she hasn't given in for three weeks. ‎-That's good. ‎-Oh, three weeks!
‎-That's good. ‎-Oh, three weeks!
‎We're proud of her.
‎There's something I don't get. ‎Is she into this guy?
‎Of course she is!
‎Yeah.
‎OK, so...
‎Good night.
‎What are you doing?
‎Cut it out, what are you doing?
‎Thought you were gonna get me ‎with a steak?
‎-That's hard. ‎-You're the one who seems hard!
‎-You on heat or what? ‎-I've liked you for years.
‎-You on heat or what? ‎-I've liked you for years. ‎Say yes or no, but say something!
‎Shit, Samy, I take guys seriously,
‎I don't go out with just anybody!
‎Do you wear nice lipstick and dress up ‎to go for dinner with just anybody?
‎By the way, you're beautiful tonight.
‎We tried before, it didn't work out.
‎We were thirteen! In year nine.
‎Exactly! What have you done since then?
‎I want reliability.
‎I go down the job center ‎every day looking for work!
‎Under twenty-fives have a hard time here. ‎Half of us are on the dole.
‎-You're twenty-six. ‎-Yeah, maybe...
‎But I'm not a bad apple.
‎If I had a bird, ‎I mean, a partner,
‎it'd well motivate me ‎to get out of trouble.
‎I need someone I can lean on, ‎not the other way round.
‎But I'd do anything for you.
‎-I'd climb Mt. Everest if I had to! ‎-Would you?
‎Whatever. You don't even know ‎how high Everest is.
‎Of course, I do.
‎We learned that in school, ‎you weren't ever there.
‎Why do you think you repeated year nine?
‎You're such a stunner, ‎how could I concentrate?
‎Come on, stop it, you got me. ‎How tall is it?
‎Well... Everest is the highest.
‎Yes, it is. ‎But that doesn't tell me how high.
‎Give or take 500 ft, ice melts, you know.
‎-Give or take 5,000 feet. ‎-I don't know,
‎-Give or take 5,000 feet. ‎-I don't know, ‎you've completely thrown me!
‎It's 29,029 feet.
‎It could be higher, I'd climb it for you!
‎Well, start by finding a job.
‎You're right. ‎You need proof?
‎To know you can count on your man?
‎Well, I'll climb Mt. bloody Everest!
‎I'll climb it for you,
‎you'll see I'm no loser and that I care.
‎Oh, yeah?
‎-You'd do that for me? ‎-Yeah, for you!
‎I can even give you children!
‎Climb Everest first, ‎then we'll see about children.
‎Deal?
‎Deal.
‎A kiss of encouragement before I go?
‎I'm not that kissy-kissy.
‎I'd rather have a proper snog ‎when you get back.
‎If you leave.
‎ALT. 95 FT
‎Stupid deal.
‎Good luck Samy ‎and don't forget to call Radio Nomad!
‎Radio Nomad, with Ben and Max!
‎-Hey, what's up? ‎-What's up, guys?
‎You get kicked out or what?
‎No, he's gonna climb mountains ‎and that kind of shit's hot man!
‎-A month's walk. ‎-How come?
‎I feel like changing a bit. ‎Damn, bro'. ‎The only idea you've had all year
‎Damn, bro'. ‎The only idea you've had all year ‎is I'm gonna walk for a month.
‎-Drop me off at the station, OK? ‎-Get in!
‎Get in the other side! ‎Get in the other side, bro'!
‎Get in the other side, bro'!
‎You look like Iron Man with that bag!
‎What you're doing's great ‎for our reputation.
‎They'll see we're not a bunch of slackers.
‎-Thanks. ‎-I respect you. ‎Here, my pleasure, take it, it's a gift!
‎Here, my pleasure, take it, it's a gift!
‎Smoking spliffs ‎at that altitude isn't advised.
‎Seriously? ‎This guy's nuts! ‎What the hell do you care,
‎This guy's nuts! ‎What the hell do you care,
‎it's like traveler's cheques, ‎trade it any time!
‎-See you, guys. ‎-Send us pics.
‎Watch out, mate.
‎KATHMANDU - ALT. 4,593 FT
‎Peter will take care of you upon arrival. ‎Peter's our on-site agent.
‎Peter...
‎-Welcome to Nepal! ‎-Thank you.
‎-Are you Peter? ‎-Yes.
‎-Is Peter your real name? ‎-No.
‎I'm Kovinajpül-Katchpü, if you prefer.
‎Peter! Let's stick to Peter! Peter's good.
‎They were talking about you on the radio!
‎Whatever.
‎I heard Samy ‎saying he was going to a mountain
‎and that he went because of you.
‎But it's not because of me!
‎He wants to climb Mt. Everest ‎to get me to go out with him.
‎No way! ‎That's so cool!
‎Where is it already, India?
‎In Nepal and China. ‎Can't see what's so cool.
‎I live on the sixth floor with no lift ‎and not one guy ‎would come up for me, honest!
‎and not one guy ‎would come up for me, honest!
‎But it's just talk to pick me up.
‎Between what he says and what he does...
‎-No, I'd be surprised. ‎-I'm telling you.
‎-He's already left. ‎-Really?
‎Youssef's brother dropped him off ‎at the station.
‎By this time he's probably there already.
‎Cut it out, you're kidding?
‎The radio's paying ‎for him to call every day
‎to tell us how it's going.
‎So did he really go for you?
‎That's what he said but...
‎It's still stupid going like that, ‎on an impulse, right?
‎Do you know many guys ‎who'd do that for you?
‎Kathmandu!
‎Hotel, is over there, on left.
‎So we'll...?
‎Are the five stars ‎included in the package?
‎Actually, ‎my sister lives in La Courneuve, ‎so I got you a special offer.
‎That's kind.
‎"My sister lives in La Courneuve."
‎So for those who like water, ‎it's going to rain from North to South.
‎We're expecting ‎up to two inches of rain...
‎We're expecting ‎up to two inches of rain... ‎Thanks for the crap news.
‎Mine's better seeing
‎as Samy's on the line, ‎calling us live from Kathmandu.
‎-Hello Samy, can you hear me? ‎-Yes, I hear you.
‎So you arrived in Kathmandu ‎a few hours ago, right?
‎Exactly.
‎Well, tell us! Thousands of people ‎are listening now!
‎Well, it's a bit of a small town, ‎there are temples everywhere.
‎People are really nice.
‎-They say ‎namaste‎ all the time. ‎-‎Namaste‎?
‎Namaste‎ means hello in Nepalese!
‎OK guys, get this, ‎our first Nepalese lesson live!
‎What's it like?
‎Does it smell of piss, like here? Tell us!
‎It's pretty calm here; not even one cop.
‎Talking of which we have ‎a question from our sound tech:
‎how's the weed in Nepal?
‎No time for fun, ‎I still have stuff to buy,
‎papers to fill out, so I have to go now.
‎What about tomorrow?
‎Tomorrow I'm catching a plane to Lukla.
‎It's at 10,000 ft. ‎The highest airport in the country.
‎It's at 10,000 ft. ‎The highest airport in the country. ‎And the most dangerous
‎apparently. ‎Oh, maybe.
‎Then I'll have to walk.
‎Of course, they won't just put you ‎on top of the peak!
‎OK, so good luck Samy, ‎and send us some photos.
‎-Thanks. ‎-6:15, Radio Nomad...
‎There's the job done!
‎Put the phone number here.
‎Person to warn in case of an accident, ‎to repatriate the body, OK?
‎Are there often accidents ‎in the mountains?
‎Much more than on the roads. Know why?
‎No.
‎Because there are no roads!
‎Thank you, thank you.
‎Have a good trip, bye!
‎They're all over the place! This is nuts!
‎-26,089 ft. ‎-Yes, impressive.
‎That one there: Pumori,
‎23,491 feet.
‎He disagrees.
‎Lhotse, 27,940 feet.
‎Yes, Lhotse? Lhotse.
‎I wanted to do that one and then...
‎-Difficult. ‎-And that one, at the back?
‎The one that, um?
‎Louis de Funès!
‎ALT. 9,396 FT
‎I need to practice.
‎You win, Johnny.
‎But don't try messing with me!
‎I'm from La Courneuve, OK?
‎How much to carry the bag up?
‎No, wait Johnny! ‎Tell me how much first!
‎Bring my damn bag back here!
‎Namaste too.
‎Beautiful.
‎Are you Jeff?
‎Samy Diakhaté. Nice to meet you.
‎I was sure it was you... ‎From what I heard about you.
‎Jeff is a professional, nice, warm.
‎So you climbed Mt. Blanc?
‎Mt. Blanc is still badass.
‎Akim did it with his sister ‎on a field trip.
‎Really?
‎-Were you roped up? ‎-Frankly?
‎No need, it was cool. ‎A health walk.
‎-Studs? ‎-No studs, no ropes.
‎All in the head! ‎And the weather was nice too.
‎Kilimanjaro.
‎It's full of crocodiles. ‎Fat chance he's been there.
‎-By the North face? ‎-A bit of each face.
‎Going to Kilimanjaro ‎gave me a taste for climbing.
‎I was... Especially the legs.
‎Empty your bag.
‎Your bag. Empty it.
‎Out here?
‎Yes.
‎Those are my trousers.
‎Smecta, you need that if your tummy hurts.
‎For night time.
‎Have you read this?
‎No need to say more.
‎My mum gave me these.
‎She said they were good ‎for sugar, sport and all.
‎Do you want one?
‎You're missing gear.
‎I'll write you another list.
‎You'll buy it in Namche.
‎We leave at 7:30 tomorrow.
‎-Any questions? ‎-No, everything's great.
‎I can't wait to get...
‎walking.
‎Hey, Johnny! ‎Does this pit-bull ever smile?
‎Here it is.
‎Put it there please. Thanks.
‎Not bad. Yeah, put it over there,
‎I'll put it away later.
‎Sit down.
‎Thank you.
‎How much this is going to cost?
‎We'll sort something out.
‎But I don't have much left.
‎And you heard him. ‎I need equipment and I'm not rich.
‎OK, we'll sort it out.
‎We'll sort it out... Say,
‎do you have cousins in Morocco?
‎Where's Morocco?
‎Forget about it.
‎Why are you smiling like that?
‎What?
‎My skin color?
‎You never saw a black guy?
‎-Seriously? ‎-Can I touch?
‎Yes.
‎See, it's a bit like you.
‎It's beautiful.
‎It's beautiful.
‎"Jonathan didn't understand ‎why Clara had decided ‎never to see him again.
‎why Clara had decided ‎never to see him again.
‎Their relationship had lasted for years
‎and even though ‎it hadn't always been rose-tinted..."
‎What's up with this story?
‎Impossible Love‎.
‎Impossible to read.

‎CHECK IT OUT
‎LIVE FROM NEPAL
‎That idiot really did it!
‎Anyway, it's not over yet.
‎I'm ready! ‎I'm ready!
‎Thank you.
‎Have they left?
‎I'll have Corn Flakes.
‎Most of the accidents that happen up there
‎are often due to lack of vigilance.
‎So we're a group,
‎we stay united,
‎and everything will be fine.
‎That's clear.
‎My job is to get you up there, ‎but especially to get you all back
‎safe and sound.
‎I'd also like to congratulate Emmerich
‎for this year's K2 climb.
‎Welcome to Samy, back from Kilimanjaro.
‎So, time for Everest?
‎What are you looking for?
‎Johnny.
‎He has my bag!
‎Your bag left over 20 minutes ago.
‎Seriously?
‎The Sherpas always leave first.
‎Without a bag ‎it's going to be a health walk!
‎We'll see about that in a few days.
‎You know that in 1953,
‎the first man to climb Mt. Everest ‎was Sir Edmund Hilary.
‎They went from Kathmandu to Lukla on foot.
‎A month's hiking to get here.
‎Oh shit! Lucky.
‎Not him. Us. ‎Lucky they invented airplanes since!
‎Then again, maybe there'll be ‎a chairlift to the top in 50 years!
‎Alright. I'm just kidding.
‎Are we never going to stop?
‎I'm taking a break, I can't take any more.
‎I didn't sleep well, my legs weigh a ton.
‎We're running, ‎we're not even taking in the view!
‎It's beautiful, isn't it?
‎No, I feel better.
‎Let's go.
‎Didn't they learn ‎to make stone bridges or what?
‎It's not too soon.
‎What a nightmare.
‎Bloody hell.
‎Thank you, you're a brother.
‎Thank you.
‎Cool.
‎Lucky you're here.
‎Bloody hell, what are they on?
‎No way! A fridge, guys?!
‎No, not now. Not the right time, dammit.
‎Sophie, from Radio Nomad. ‎You're on air in one minute.
‎You're on air in one minute.
‎OK.
‎Hi everyone, it's 7:10 ‎and you're live on Radio Nomad,
‎Hi everyone, it's 7:10 ‎and you're live on Radio Nomad, ‎we're about to welcome ‎our main man Samy...
‎Your brother's on the radio!
‎... from Seine-Saint-Denis ‎to the Himalayas!
‎Samy boy! Can you hear me?
‎Yeah, I can hear you.
‎Hi there! Your fan base ‎is growing here, you know?
‎Really? Thanks, that's nice.
‎So tell us. Where are you now?
‎We've just stopped in a village ‎called Phadking.
‎Hard to pronounce.
‎There are about ten stone houses, ‎not more.
‎OK, cool. ‎Are you by yourself, with a group, ‎have you made any buddies?
‎Have you got it on?
‎There aren't many of us, ‎different nationalities,
‎we don't all have the same level. ‎Tell us our champion is one of the best!
‎Tell us our champion is one of the best!
‎These guys are good. ‎The Australians look like the All Blacks.
‎Not the right team, but no worries.
‎Give me two days and I'll show them up!
‎-I'll be a real Sherpa. ‎-That's my boy!
‎Scorching!
‎It's not a 300-feet sprint either. ‎And as my dad says, ‎slow and steady wins the race.
‎And as my dad says, ‎slow and steady wins the race.
‎You're gonna make me cry, ‎but your dad didn't invent that phrase.
‎Sorry, I've got to go, we're off already.
‎-Good luck, we'll speak tomorrow. ‎-Thanks, bye.
‎Come on, guys!
‎Come on kids, get ready for school.
‎Breathe, lengthen your step.
‎Don't slump on your hips, stay straight,
‎get vertical.
‎That was ultra boring.
‎He lets out three words a minute, ‎no rhythm, no jokes.
‎It's dire! ‎No comeback, nothing.
‎The phone lines are busy.
‎Kids are calling in from everywhere. ‎Really?
‎I don't get it, why? ‎Well, he's climbing Mt. Everest ‎for some girl's love.
‎Well, he's climbing Mt. Everest ‎for some girl's love.
‎Still, 10,000 ft.
‎-How high does he want to go? ‎-29,029 ft.
‎Wasn't there an easier way ‎to get rid of him?
‎I didn't want that, ‎it was just a conversation.
‎Well, now the whole neighborhood knows.
‎How could I guess he'd go on the radio?
‎-Are you into him or not? ‎-Well...
‎He's alright.
‎You're into him.
‎It's no biggie, you can tell me!
‎Wait three weeks and you'll see.
‎I don't just want a fling,
‎I want to get it right.
‎They're all dicks anyway.
‎Gotta go.
‎Hey honey, it's me.
‎-Where's your brother? ‎-At football.
‎-And what are you up to? ‎-Revising.
‎Good girl.
‎Tell me, have you heard ‎from your friend Samy?
‎Who?
‎Samy Diakhaté, ‎your childhood friend ‎who's in the Himalayas.
‎Don't take me for a fool, ‎everybody's listening to the radio.
‎I haven't heard anything.
‎I don't know if he's really doing it ‎for you, but he's brave.
‎I like him.
‎Where are you going?
‎I'm going to get some equipment.
‎And my bag?
‎Samy, concentrate on your feet!
‎Let it pass, this one looks stubborn.
‎-But how can you tell? ‎-The eyes.
‎-Yellow eyes mean stubborn? ‎-No. It happens because of their diet.
‎-Yellow eyes mean stubborn? ‎-No. It happens because of their diet. ‎Back home, it's red eyes.
‎Red?
‎Because of the weed.
‎Oh, damn.
‎So ‎donyeba‎ means thank you?
‎I don't know about ‎donyeba‎, ‎but ‎dhanybhad‎ means thank you.
‎The gear they had back then is a joke.
‎They look like the chimney sweeps ‎from Mary Poppins.
‎That's harsh.
‎They make me sick, seriously!
‎They carry stuff like that all day?
‎Yes.
‎You should eat your sandwiches up.
‎No, really, I'm good.
‎Just a bit of tea.
‎Namas-tea.
‎The bastard! Jeff!
‎ALT. 11,286 FT
‎Namche.
‎Thank you, Johnny.
‎You've got them all.
‎Do you even know who he is?
‎Johnny Hallyday.
‎"Johnny Lallyday."
‎Do you know his songs?
‎-How about the t-shirt? ‎-A French guy.
‎He stayed here. ‎He became a monk.
‎No shit?
‎-He gave me all his t-shirts. ‎-And gave everything up?
‎And this? What's the story?
‎You won't like it, honest. Let it go.
‎Love story?
‎Yes, but you see, ‎it says ‎Impossible Amour‎.
‎Can you read it to me?
‎OK, I'll read it to you.
‎But first, we have to buy some kit.
‎Jeff gave me his list and you know he's...
‎"Johnny Lallyday."
‎We'll sort it out.
‎We'll sort it out, ‎but don't forget I'm paying.
‎You're a laugh, ‎the poles already cost me a lot.
‎You're shopping too!
‎-Studs. ‎-Yes, studs.
‎No need to sort things out to take money.
‎Oh, crap, hooligans are all I need.
‎I'll stick to the tea.
‎And a tea.
‎-Are you from Paris? ‎-Yes, I am.
‎Paris Saint Germain!
‎Exactly.
‎You know, the PSG doesn't run fast enough.
‎No fears.
‎Spread out, guys!
‎Come on, wake up you Spice Girls.
‎Get your Nepalese passport ‎if you're on their side!
‎If you want to piss, ‎go over there, don't talk to me!
‎Did you still fight well? ‎Oh, we stuck in there!
‎We're proud of you, mate! ‎So what's next?
‎No more towns. It's just stones from here.
‎Sounds interesting. ‎So from now it's straight to the top?
‎No, tomorrow we're leaving ‎to base camp.
‎It's at 17,000 ft. ‎It's getting serious.
‎Frankly, I never thought ‎I'd go so high up.
‎Since you've been gone, ‎our listeners have tripled. ‎You have fans all over France, it's crazy.
‎You have fans all over France, it's crazy.
‎People are listening to you ‎instead of going to work.
‎That said, no one ‎has ever really worked here.
‎Take care of yourself. ‎Don't worry.
‎I'm in control.
‎Bye, guys!
‎Oh shit, it's Mt. Everest, ‎it's Mt. Everest!
‎No, it's Mt. Lhotse.
‎-Mt. Lho...? ‎-Mt. Lhotse.
‎-Mt. Lho... ‎-Mt. Lhotse.
‎-27,940 ft. ‎-Of course, Mt. Lhotse.
‎-I need to stop stopping like that. ‎-Maybe.
‎Beautiful, huh?
‎Don't watch.
‎Don't look back.
‎Keep up the pace, Samy!
‎Keep up the pace...
‎Look up, Samy.
‎Make your mind up.
‎Look up.
‎-He didn't even call this morning. ‎-I know.
‎So you're listening in now?
‎No, my mum told me.
‎You're the only one here not listening.
‎It doesn't mean ‎I'm not thinking about him.
‎I hope nothing's happened to him.
‎There's probably no signal, that's all.
‎Hello.
‎"The phone kept ringing, ‎but nobody answered,
‎only the echo of the tone ‎losing itself in Clara's house.
‎At the other end of the line, ‎Jonathan cried
‎At the other end of the line, ‎Jonathan cried ‎and couldn't hang up."
‎Of course she's in love, ‎she digs him, but he doesn't know it.
‎-He never shows. ‎-Shows?
‎Like a magic show. With rabbits.
‎Like a magic show. With rabbits. ‎He never compliments her.
‎Plus, he's loaded, ‎so he gets all the girls he wants.
‎So Clara dumped him.
‎Now she's the one giving him ‎a hard time, understand?
‎A bit.
‎Women are like mountains, Johnny.
‎You have to be worthy of them. ‎Understand?
‎It's six o'clock. Welcome to Radio Nomad.
‎You're with Ben and Max ‎until nine o'clock.
‎Couldn't we say "Max and Ben" for once?
‎You're with Max and Ben...
‎Hear that, mum! It's for me!
‎And sadly, no Samy.
‎No, he's climbing Mt. Everest ‎for a girl's love.
‎Sorry! He hasn't called ‎for three days now.
‎Try unlocking an iPhone in mittens.
‎So he left ‎ten days ago,
‎the last time we spoke, ‎he'd reached 13,000 ft,
‎bringing him halfway to the top ‎of the highest summit in the world!
‎With a guy from the estate on the top!
‎Our answerphone ‎is crowded with messages. ‎We picked some out.
‎is crowded with messages. ‎We picked some out.
‎So it's time ‎to give the listeners the mic.
‎Hi, it's Nedjma, I'm from Val-d'Oise.
‎If Nadia dumps you, ‎I'll have you whenever you like!
‎I've left my picture on the website.
‎OK, Nedjma, ‎we'll get you his phone number!
‎What a slag.
‎Where the hell are you?
‎Look.
‎Oh, yeah.
‎From now on, ‎one step,
‎one breath.
‎And above all, don't stop anymore.
‎I get the one step, one breath thing.
‎ALT. 15,157 FT
‎It's not the same air in La Courneuve.
‎It's Mr. Diakhaté, Samy's father!
‎Hello, Mr. Diakhaté. I'm glad you called.
‎Yes, I'm worried too, sir.
‎Why are we stopping?
‎For old friends.
‎They took my child! ‎They took my child! My love!
‎I want Samy! ‎CLIMBING EVEREST FOR LOVE: SAMY DISAPPEARS

‎Next time don't let him go, ‎it'll make things easier.
‎What an idiot, ‎sending a Cameroonian there...
‎Senegalese... He's Senegalese.
‎I want all the pictures of my logo ‎off the website.
‎Got it?
‎No, sir!
‎We can't take the pictures down.
‎No, we can't blur them either.
‎But because... I can't. No!
‎Shit, this is bad.
‎What a mess.
‎Are you busy tonight?
‎No.
‎I hope you're proud of yourself!
‎-Hello, Mrs. Diakhaté. ‎-Don't Mrs. Diakhaté me!
‎What have you done to my son?
‎Calm down. ‎It's none of your business!
‎Why did you send him away ‎to be killed in the mountains?
‎...my son would still be here!
‎If he's dead, it's your fault!
‎What are you doing here?
‎Where's your farmer?
‎All by yourself?
‎Are you the stubborn type?
‎Let me see your eyes.
‎Listen Chewbacca, ‎I've got something for you.
‎Wait.
‎Who's getting a sweet?
‎You've never had one of these.
‎Don't say no!
‎Plus, you don't have to worry ‎about the dentist.
‎Slowly.
‎It's good, huh?
‎See, it's good.
‎Don't tell your friends I gave you one ‎or they'll be after me.
‎Gotta go, they're waiting for me.
‎Look at the helicopter there!
‎Keep up the pace!
‎-We'll freeze at this speed! ‎-Each to his own pace!
‎I wasn't born in the Alps!
‎Stick to the path.
‎Damn.
‎Poor guys.
‎I don't know the way, Jeff!
‎I want a reliable guy.
‎You'll see I'm no loser ‎and I care about you.
‎-‎You'd do that for me? ‎-Nadia.
‎What am I doing here?
‎Try to go all the way this time.
‎Nadia?
‎You'd do that for me?
‎Bloody hell.
‎What the hell am I doing?
‎Okay Samy.
‎Pull yourself together.
‎You have to go on, not allowed to let go.
‎If you stop now, they'll all laugh at you.
‎Come on, Samy, come on!
‎BASE CAMP - ALT. 17,598 FT
‎Well done, Samy!
‎Come on, get something hot to drink.
‎Congratulations.
‎Sit down, you're not at the top yet.
‎Welcome to Base Camp!
‎I like the red logo...
‎Hello, Radio Nomad?
‎Hello, it's Samy.
‎Oh crap, it's Samy!
‎Stay on the line!
‎They've found him! ‎Whatever you do, don't hang up!
‎Oh crap, I'm so happy!
‎It's Samy, it's Samy!
‎Hello Samy? ‎I can hear you.
‎Oh god, you scared the crap out of us!
‎You haven't called for five days!
‎Well guys, the package you got me ‎is rubbish!
‎Only satellite phones work.
‎-Are you OK? You're not ill? ‎-It's really cold, but it's OK.
‎-I'm at base camp. ‎-So over 16,400 ft?
‎17,600, it's crazy!
‎You rock mate! ‎But keep calling us, right?
‎I'm in the middle of nowhere. ‎There's no signal.
‎I'm in the middle of nowhere. ‎There's no signal. ‎I can't call you all the time.
‎Evening is the best time.
‎Call tomorrow evening, we'll record it.
‎I wanted to ask you guys...
‎can you let my parents know that I'm OK?
‎-I can't really call from here. ‎-Of course.
‎We're on it buddy. ‎Thanks. Ciao.
‎-Mr. Diakhaté? ‎-Speaking.
‎It's Ben from Radio Nomad, ‎I've heard from your son.
‎Everything's fine. ‎Are you mad?
‎I could have broken my nose!
‎-He arrived at base camp. ‎-Give me your company's number.
‎Shut up! ‎And...
‎And... ‎Sorry, Mr. Diakhaté?
‎No, no! Not you.
‎OK, he's fine and I'll call you
‎as soon as we hear from him. ‎That's very kind. Thank you so much.
‎That's very kind. Thank you so much.
‎They've just found my son.
‎-On Mt. Everest. ‎-OK...
‎Nadia, they've found him!
‎He's at base camp.
‎-Hello. ‎-Hello.
‎Didier.
‎Samy. Nice to meet you.
‎-Do I know you? ‎-I'm not sure... Maybe on TV?
‎Didier Fauconnier? The adventurer?
‎-No way! ‎-I just do nature shows.
‎You travel and get paid for it, come on!
‎It's still a lot of work.
‎Living in Seine-Saint-Denis's ‎a lot of work and there's no pay.
‎Yeah, I get it.
‎Ah, let me introduce my team.
‎Charlotte, my cameraman and director.
‎-Charlotte, Samy. ‎-Hi, Charlotte!
‎Hi, team!
‎-Are you here on shoot? ‎-I've already tried Everest twice.
‎Third time lucky. ‎I don't want to lose a third one.
‎I've been training in Argentina. ‎How about you?
‎Mostly Mt. St Michel.
‎The biscuits, I guess?
‎Three times a day.
‎Not many people here ‎manage first time round.
‎See the Australians there?
‎They're stopping here, ‎they just came for a walk.
‎That's why they were fueling like planes?
‎See the Koreans?
‎They'll probably get ‎to camp number four, max.
‎The Germans however, ‎are on their second try.
‎They'll make it this time.
‎Yeah, they're on fire.
‎-And the English? ‎-They'll stop at number two.
‎After that there's no more beer.
‎The most important ‎is to prepare for next time.
‎Stop right there,
‎I don't have the luxury ‎to pay for a second time.
‎Get this: a young man from the suburbs ‎climbs Everest for love.
‎You're kidding?
‎He's already at 17,400 ft.
‎OK for duty!
‎Remember to drink a lot of water.
‎Well, I've been doing that from the start.
‎We can take him higher?
‎For now, no problems.
‎That's good news! ‎Who's going to climb Mt. Everest?
‎-Know how to put that on? ‎-Come on, I'm not dumb!
‎See you at the wall.
‎Is the altitude making him sulky?
‎It's nuts.
‎I can do it. ‎I had the same on Mt. Kilimanjaro!
‎I think it's broken.
‎Funny, huh?
‎I'm not used to this model. ‎It must be extra small.
‎All by myself, look.
‎Tell Jeff I helped you put it on me, OK?
‎Oh, crap!
‎Hit and climb.
‎But? Who do I hit? Right to the top?
‎Come on, Samy!
‎It's your call.
‎Hit and climb.
‎OK, I get it. ‎Samy, your turn!
‎Doesn't this ice melt?
‎Hit and climb.
‎Not "climb and hit"?
‎Hit and climb. Hit and climb.
‎Come on, put your hands on the wall.
‎Go!
‎Hit, for Christ's sake!
‎Easier on Mt. Kilimanjaro, was it?
‎We haven't got all day! Shit!
‎I can't take it any more.
‎If you're not ready in three days, ‎you're out of here.
‎Bloody hell...
‎-Now go back down. ‎-Which way?
‎The way you came up, loser!
‎Louis de Funès!
‎Listen, Jeff. ‎The fun's over now.
‎This French loser ‎can't get up the small wall.
‎We don't want him in our team.
‎-He's dangerous. ‎-It's not your decision.
‎Oh, no.
‎No, no!
‎Sorry, I'm not in the mood to read to you.
‎If you want, we can sort it out.
‎It's all over.
‎You read, and I teach you to climb.
‎Sure you don't have family in Morocco?
‎Go on, climb!
‎That's good! Climb upwards!
‎Pull upwards!
‎Careful.
‎I'm spent.
‎Higher, higher.
‎Come on.
‎Dammit, Samy!
‎Up! Up! Everything's up here!
‎Hit and climb!
‎Hit and climb! What am I doing?
‎-Samy, up! Pull upwards. ‎-I can't believe it.
‎Come on, Samy!
‎Come on.
‎Was that good?
‎What? Didn't you see my abseiling?
‎You...
‎Hit and climb, again?
‎Oh yeah, I hit and I climb. Sugar!
‎"The bad-tempered man turned ‎into a charming-voiced seducer.
‎She couldn't push him away, ‎especially when he renewed his apology."
‎It's stuck!
‎Hit and climb!
‎Like with a hammer.
‎Yes, go on, climb!
‎How about that?
‎"Despite it all, she raised her head..."
‎Her mother hadn't wanted her ‎to be with Nico.
‎So Cony said... she doesn't care.
‎So! Are we climbing Everest or what?
‎Hit and climb!
‎Well done.
‎One mistake and you're at the bottom, OK?
‎-I'm fond of him! ‎-He's so nice!
‎Ben, Radio Nomad.
‎Florence from ‎Le Parisien‎. ‎We spoke on the phone.
‎Say, this is... a lively place!
‎Yes, especially ‎since the past three weeks!
‎-Thank you for having me. ‎-Let's go.
‎It's eight o'clock, welcome to the land
‎of concrete and unemployment!
‎Mountain dweller friends, ‎welcome to the highest radio in France! ‎What's that accent?
‎It's the only one I can do!

‎Is that all you can say?
‎Learn some vocabulary, bro'.
‎Have you ever opened a book before?

‎"The end to this story ‎that floats away too,
‎like a leaf on the autumn wind.
‎But deep down, ‎Clara knows that love isn't far away.
‎She can feel the bud ‎being born again in her heart
‎like a flower feeling for spring."
‎Does that mean: they see again?
‎Of course, they will.
‎She's mad about him.
‎She acts all proud, but she's in love.
‎But you said he was a fool?
‎Yeah, I said he was a fool. ‎But that was before.
‎He's grown now.
‎-Now, he knows what's important. ‎-What's that?
‎What's important is that... ‎before you can love someone,
‎you have to love yourself.
‎It means you have to stop ‎going up and down.
‎Settle down, brother. Find a girl.
‎Take her out to dinner, talk to her, ‎and afterwards...
‎No, no!
‎-Never before marriage! ‎-Seriously?
‎Well, then get married and then...
‎Thanks.
‎I'm the one thanking you, bro'. ‎You've been great!
‎We'll sort something out!
‎Bad weather's closing in. ‎We have to leave now.
‎But it's 2 a.m.!
‎-It's now or in ten days. ‎-OK.
‎So we're leaving now!
‎One step. Two breaths.
‎Damn, no!
‎Jeff, my light's gone out.
‎Your pins will get you up there, ‎not your light.
‎Are you kidding? I can't see a thing.

‎I'm not going to make it.
‎Before we go back to the news,
‎a report on the young man ‎from La Courneuve.
‎His name is Samy Diakhaté, ‎and he decided last month,
‎with no experience, ‎to take on the highest mountain ‎in the world: Mt. Everest.
‎to take on the highest mountain ‎in the world: Mt. Everest. ‎Today he is almost 26,300 ft up
‎and is about to make his dream come true.
‎Jérôme Brière ‎brings us the unusual portrait ‎of this young Frenchman,
‎who's gone from the 4,000 estate ‎to the top of the world.
‎Indeed Julian, all of Samy's friends ‎are proud of the feat ‎he's about to achieve.
‎are proud of the feat ‎he's about to achieve.
‎He already had something else. ‎I always believed in him.
‎FRENCH TEACHER AT JACQUES BREL HIGHSCHOOL
‎Samy's the pride of the neighborhood. ‎It proves we're not just losers.
‎Give us a job and we'll get it done. ‎Exactly, mate.
‎We're doing something. ‎This is our place, see.
‎La Courneuve!
‎That's our Samy! ‎We took him to the station.
‎I sponsored him because I believed in him.
‎I knew he could go to the top.
‎Right away, I knew.
‎Only one step left to reach happiness, ‎but the highest step by far.
‎Indeed, he has entered ‎what alpinists call the death zone.
‎The most extreme cold on the planet, ‎where the oxygen is most rare.
‎Are you sleeping?
‎Guess.
‎The silence is worrying me.
‎-What was that? ‎-An avalanche.
‎Less worried?
‎-Should I have a look? ‎-Yes.
‎Nadia, it's me, ‎Samy.
‎I said I'd do anything for you.
‎Well, here I am.
‎I'm really out of control.
‎I don't even like the mountains.
‎I prefer the sea.
‎I'd love to take you to the seaside.
‎To lay on a deck chair ‎and sip cocktails all day.
‎Just you and me. ‎Just you and me.
‎I've got to go and try to get some sleep.
‎You know... ‎they say "out of sight, out of mind".
‎It's not true.
‎I'm just saying in case...
‎I just wanted you to know.
‎Lots of love.
‎Is this your phone? ‎Yes.
‎Next time you want to make a call ask me.
‎Yeah, no, because...
‎Will you be alright?
‎Yes.
‎Hello.
‎Hello. Can we see your parents?
‎Hello. Come in, please.
‎Thank you. Hello.
‎Sorry to bother you, ‎but my daughter ‎has something to say to you.
‎I just wanted to say...
‎that I've known Samy ‎since secondary school, and...
‎I've been in... ‎in love with him ever since.
‎You know, it's not easy here...
‎She's so pretty.
‎To be in love. ‎You have to be hard, strong.
‎You have to keep boys at a distance.
‎It's not easy to guard your feelings.
‎I feel really strongly about Samy, ‎but I was scared about everything,
‎scared he would... discard me, ‎wouldn't want me, ‎wouldn't take me seriously,
‎wouldn't want me, ‎wouldn't take me seriously, ‎about being sad.
‎I'm sorry.
‎And now...
‎I'm not afraid at all, ‎not at all, and when he comes back
‎I want to give him all my love.
‎I just wanted to tell you.
‎Come here, my girl.
‎Thank you.
‎No more than five minutes without oxygen.
‎Is it just the two of us? ‎The Germans have left.
‎Don't waste time, get ready. ‎No, I'm not coming.
‎What do you mean?
‎Dorge is going with you.
‎But who's he?
‎Dorge.
‎OK, great.
‎So I'm going to be stuck ‎between two pit-bulls.
‎-Why him? ‎-Dorge is the only Sherpa
‎who can get you to the top.
‎You'll see, Mt. Blanc ‎will be easier after this.
‎-Charlotte? ‎-Yes?
‎In your phone ‎there's a number I've often called.
‎-Yes, I saw. ‎-It's the radio.
‎Can you tell them I've left?
‎I'll tell them you're coming back, ‎it'll be less scary.
‎Samy, it's not a good time, we're late.
‎Thank you.
‎Please, let go of your phone.
‎You're making me dizzy!
‎Sorry, I don't know what else to do.
‎There are ten pounds of potatoes ‎in the kitchen.
‎-Should I peel all of them? ‎-Given your state, yes.
‎It's dead! ‎You're doing this on purpose!
‎No, the radio, it's dead!
‎You're not going to leave my son ‎alone in the mountains!
‎-Hello. ‎-Hello.
‎Our radio's broken.
‎Come in, please.
‎-Hello. ‎-Hello, kids.
‎Hello Nadia. Can you put ‎the radio on for us, please?
‎Of course.
‎-Come in, sit down. ‎-Thank you.
‎Come on.
‎It's time to hand the mic over ‎to Ben and Max,
‎who have set their studio up ‎in La Courneuve
‎to follow the last hours ‎of Samy Diakhaté's ascent, live!
‎Can you hear me?
‎Yes, Richard! ‎We hear you!
‎We're in front of Samy's tower block ‎and it's crazy!
‎Did you make it?
‎No.
‎Good luck.
‎Big up to Mr. Menaz!
‎He's an important guy!
‎Mr. Menaz, you've been ‎a mountaineer since 1961
‎and a Himalaya specialist!
‎I've been there a few times, yes.
‎Samy left camp number four four hours ago,
‎so apparently ‎he's off for a 3,000 ft climb.
‎Is he almost there? ‎He's probably only just half way.
‎What's important isn't so much the pace,
‎it's not stopping.
‎Those are nice words. Mr. Menaz is wise. ‎Big up to him! Thank you.
‎Aren't the stars beautiful?
‎The stars...
‎What's up with you?
‎Damn, it's beautiful.
‎You know, my father, ‎used to hit me with his belt ‎to make me carry on.
‎He was a military man.
‎Heart like a stone.
‎You haven't spoken to me in a month.
‎Can't you wait for tonight ‎to tell me this?
‎And my mother... would plant... ‎in the garden...
‎We had a wheelbarrow.
‎He's out of it.
‎Take him back down!
‎I don't want his body on my hands!
‎Plus, I'm the only black guy for miles.
‎We'll get you back down.
‎We're not leaving you like this.
‎-It'll be fine, OK? ‎-Nice smell of jasmine.
‎Would you like to call your parents?
‎I'm sure you have loads to talk about. ‎You're a good son, Jeff.
‎You're a good son.
‎You're right.
‎We have things... ‎things to talk about.
‎Go all the way, Samy.
‎-Go all the way. ‎-Don't worry.
‎We've just received ‎a message from Charlotte
‎who's on site with Didier Fauconnier, ‎the great reporter, who's just given up.
‎The Germans also gave up a few hours ago.
‎But still no news from our main man Samy, ‎but we're backing him.
‎Stop telling me "come on"!
‎I can't go any further.
‎The voice of wisdom.
‎So now Samy is alone with his Sherpa.
‎Is that good or bad news?
‎Even with a group, it's all in the head.
‎He's probably been alone ‎for a few hours now.
‎-Is the Sherpa always easygoing? ‎-Yes.
‎Thank you, Mr. Menaz!
‎Wait.
‎You're making me nervous, ‎and I can't breathe already.
‎What is it?
‎There's only 15 feet left!
‎Listen.
‎I can't come back next year!
‎No, dammit!
‎Listen, bro'.
‎Take me up, please!
‎Come on, take me up.
‎Take me up, I'm begging you.
‎Thank you, Dorge.

Who did this to you, Ricky?
Was it Steve?
Nugg?

Johnny knows we have an informant.
But it's all worked out for the best, Ricky.
We raided one of the houses you were buying from.
His crew flipped on him and sold him out.

Because you got shot.
They think you're a risk to the other kids.
Listen, there's spares under the sink, but what do you say we rinse that one out? They're, like,
three bucks a bag. I'm not rinsing this fucking out.
If you want to save money, you rinse it out. Okay, okay.
Just asking.
You know, maybe we'll buy in bulk next time.
Bound to be cheaper.
Here, give me that. I'll take it for a wash. All right? Whatever you need, champ.
All right? Whatever you need, champ.
Whatever you need.
Hey, Ricky.
You know, there's a gun show in a few weeks.
Maybe you and I take a road trip, if you're feeling up for it. Sounds great.
if you're feeling up for it. Sounds great.
The driver was shot in the arm NEWSCASTER: (ON TV) during the holdup and taken to the hospital.
during the holdup and taken to the hospital. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Police say the gunfire was staged.
If found guilty...
...years in the penitentiary.
You gonna get yourself shot, knocking on a stranger's door like that, kid.
You're Ricky Wershe, right?
Yeah. You've made a baby with my sister.
Who? Brenda Moore.
You need to call her and be a man about it.
Look, I only been with Brenda, like, a couple times.
Only take one time to make a baby.
Besides, Keisha damn near as white as you is.
Who the fuck Keisha?
RICHARD: Ricky! My niece, your daughter.
Shut the fucking door, will you? Letting all the heat out.
Who the hell are you? You his daddy?
Well, now you a granddaddy. That's right.
Be a man, call my sister. If you don't, I'll be back.
And you don't want me coming back.
What's he talking about, Rick? I don't know. I chilled with his sister.
And you didn't wear nothing?
Ah, fuck, Rick.
Brenda, your baby daddy here.
What's Grandpa doing sitting out there? He drove me.
Ricky Wershe. Hey, Brenda Moore.
Oh, Christ.
What?
What's up, Grandpa? "What's up, Grandpa?"
RICK: She's so tiny.
She supposed to be that tiny?
She only a month and a half.
She's pretty, just like you. (CHUCKLES)
Be bad news if she looked like me.
I didn't mean that how it sound.
She yours, Ricky. I'm not playing you.
I mean, I'm happy she yours.
Just make sure you support her head, okay? (BABY GURGLING)
BRENDA: Acting different around Daddy.
This is your daddy.
Ain't no way that's my son's baby.
She's way too beautiful.
Here, son, let me hold her. Let me show you how it's done.
Come here, you. Come here. There you are. Yeah.
I used to do this little dance with your daddy and his sister, yeah.
(BABY GURGLING) (SOFTLY) Yes, ma'am. It's all brand-new, isn't it? You like to dance?
You like to dance?
Yes, ma'am.
RICHARD: Here, straight talk?
Your mother and I, we... We didn't plan on having Dawn.
I mean, to be honest, we didn't plan on having you, either.
But in the end, things worked out.
Dad, your daughter is a junkie, and I'm shitting into a bag.
Well, what can I say, you know?
Glass-half-full kind of guy.
You're gonna be a great dad. I know you are.
You know, I was thinking, as soon as we get this video store up and running, first thing I want to buy is a new set of wheels.
first thing I want to buy is a new set of wheels.
I know things haven't proceeded as anticipated,
but a good idea, Rick, is like a fine wine.
It gets better with time.
Things aren't gonna get better, Dad.
You happy with this?
You happy with who you are?
Don't be thinking what the right answer is.
There's only one right answer.
You know how we can change this.
No.
No drugs, God damn it. No drugs.
No drugs.
They're poison, Ricky.
They kill people. No fucking way.
What the fuck do you think you're selling? Water pistols?
Ricky, guns are a constitutional right.
There's nothing in the Constitution about drugs.
The fuck are you talking about? I'm talking about the goddamn Constitution,
what this fucking country was founded on, Ricky. (HORN BLARING) Dad!
Fuck!
RICHARD: Uh... You okay? Yeah.
RICHARD: Oh, shit.
Look at this shit. Look how we're living.
We got to do something, Dad.
We got to make some money.
No. No drugs, Ricky.
Fuck, Dad. You know I can't do that.
You been selling to the drug dealers every damn day.
The only difference is you been making pennies on the dollar.
You know, about time we go grab the dollar, don't you think?
Hey, come on, Dad.
I can do this.
We can do this.
I mean, I know the players.
And I know their game.
Ah, Ricky, I already lost Dawn.
I can't lose you, too. Dad, we didn't lose Dawn.
There's just no way she's coming home the way things are.
There's just nothing to come home to.
Like, ain't nobody gonna help us.
We got to do this before it's too late.
I've got a daughter, too, now.
RICK: What up, Art?
Hey, kid.
What the fuck?
You told me to look you up sometime.
Come in.
What's up, bro? MAN: Give me an eight, man. Two.
RICK: Hey, Dawn. It's me. Ricky.
Yeah. Ricky?
I brought Dad, too.
We're gonna take you home. (DAWN GROANS) DAWN: Why he here?
I fucking... Fucking hate him, Ricky.
You know how much I hate him.
We're gonna take you home.
DAWN: Nah, I don't want to go home. This my home.
This my home. RICKY: No, Dawn. You need to come with us, okay?
RICKY: No, Dawn. You need to come with us, okay?
You need to come with us now.
I got all my stuff here. I can't leave my stuff.
It's all shit, Dawn. We'll get you new stuff.
You'll get me new stuff?
Whatever you want.
Promise?
I promise.
DAWN: No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
No, no! Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
Don't touch me! Get your fucking hands off me, Dad!
Get your hands off me! No!
Get the fuck off of me!
Don't touch me! Don't touch me! (SCREAMING)
RICHARD: (SOFTLY) Hey.
(DOORKNOB RATTLING) DAWN: Open the door!
Hey! Hey! Open the door!
Open the door!
Please!
Please!
(PANTING) Please. Dad? Please?
Dad, please? Please?
Please let me out.
Brenda!
Grandmother.
(SCOFFS) Yo, she's something else, y'all.
so incredibly beautiful. LUKE: (ON TV) You are
LAURA: I love you so much.
(KNOCK ON DOOR) WOMAN: (ON TV) When will you be there?
MAN: I was just leaving now.
WOMAN: Well, I might just drop by.
I'll have the bubbly waiting. About half an hour. WOMAN: (CHUCKLES) All right.
WOMAN: (CHUCKLES) All right. I can't wait.
RICHARD: ...by himself.
Said he's got a scar where his arm was about to fall off.
Picks a thorn, threads it with the string.
Sews himself up. Here we go. All right.
All right, now, come on, here we go.
I want to make a toast. Yeah, straight thug. Here we go, here we go.
You all right?
Me and the boys gonna go out later. You want to come? Uh... I promised Grandma
You want to come? Uh... I promised Grandma I'd make cookies with her.
I know. I'm a loser.
No. You were just lost for a little bit.
It ain't the same thing at all.
Thanks.
There they are right there. Hang on, Pop. I'm not done with you.
Back in here. I got a toast. RAY: Oh, God. Ah, fuck. Hey, hey. Right here. Dawn?
MAN: Lot of work. RICHARD: Come on in.
Everybody, I want to make a toast.
Here's to family. Everybody, drink up.
ALL: To family. Yeah, family.
Cheers. Yeah.
MAN: There you go, baby! (LIVELY CHATTER, LAUGHTER)
Let's go!
Hey, Cathy.
Hey, Ricky.
Long time no see. Oh, you've been seeing me plenty.
I know, 'cause I've been seeing you seeing me. ♪ Keep tickin' and tockin', work it all around...
You're doing a very dangerous thing, Ricky.
Damn.
This bitch is nice.
How's Lil Man doing?
You mean how he doing with you here with his wife in the middle of the night?
No, I mean how is he doing?
Johnny in prison for 20 years, that's how he doing.
And I'm here.
All alone.
Why you didn't call me, Ricky? I thought we were friends.
I've been busy.
Mmm. That's what I hear.
White Boy Rick been getting some of Art Derrick Miami sun.
You know the reason Johnny in jail and you and me free, Ricky?
'Cause we're smarter.
I made Johnny what he was.
But he trusts too many people.
If he had just stuck to the people I introduced him to,
I wouldn't be alone.
You wouldn't be here.
Like what you see, Ricky?
Then why you standing over there?
What are you doing out here?
Keeping watch. Making sure your sister gets home.
(DAWN LAUGHS) Dad, I'm pretty sure Dawn can cross the street by herself.
Yeah, you'd be surprised how easy it is to take a wrong turn, no matter how short the journey.
to take a wrong turn, no matter how short the journey.
Is you all right? Yeah, I'm better than all right.
Seeing you and Dawn tonight, Ma and Pa,
hell, I'm damn near perfect.
It's just that, uh...
Just what? Well, it's fragile.
This thing. Family.
And I don't want it to come apart, you know?
I don't want to break it, again.
Well, why don't you go in, and I'll wait for her.
Eh, she's my watch to keep.
Same as you.
(CHUCKLES) I can watch my own ass, Dad. RICHARD: Mmm-hmm.
Let's not break this, Ricky.
Let's not get greedy.
We don't need much more than we already have right now.
Yeah. All right, Pops.
(SNIFFS) Goddamn. Your ass smells like a whorehouse on New Year's morning. For real?
on New Year's morning. For real? Yeah, for real.
Good night, Dad. (CHUCKLING)
(DOOR CLOSES) Good night, son.
The fuck are you doing?
Since when do you shave? I'm shaving.
Since now. You ain't got no hair!
Oh, yeah? No, not the face! That's gonna hurt!
(LOUD BANG) Hey! Quiet down, Rick! Drop the gun!
Quiet down, Rick! Get on the ground!
Get down! You get down on the goddamn ground! Stop resisting! Get down!
Up against the fucking wall! Back up! Back the fuck up!
Ricky, what the fuck is going on? Don't move!
Ricky, what the fuck is going on? Don't move! Hey, don't fucking touch her! Don't fucking touch her!
Hey, don't fucking touch her! Don't fucking touch her!
Enough! Get him up. Hold on. Let go!
Ricky! Ricky! Come on. Fuck!
The fuck you think, Rick, huh? You think you wasn't gonna get caught?
The fuck you think, Rick, huh? You think you wasn't gonna get caught? I don't know what the fuck you talking about!
I don't know what the fuck you talking about! You don't know what the fuck I'm talking about?
Fucker, look at me. Eight kilos.
Keep your fucking hands off of him! Eight kilos.
Rick! RICK: You think I'm fucking stupid?
No, boy, I think you're fucked, that's what I think! Get off of him!
DETECTIVE JACKSON: Ain't no burgers Rick!
and fries back there, huh, bitch?
The fuck is going on?
BUFALINO JR.: This is what we're up against, gentlemen.
BUFALINO JR.: This is what we're up against, gentlemen. Okay, I mean, they're making him out like he's Capone.
Okay, I mean, they're making him out like he's Capone.
That's the sentiment in the city.
The mayor himself has warned me to stay clear of this.
Ricky's a leper.
Look, Bill, it's not like he killed anyone.
650 grams, Rick. That's the law.
You know how much was in that box? Eight kilos.
That's 8,000 grams. It would be better for Ricky
That's 8,000 grams. It would be better for Ricky if he had killed someone. Where are the Feds
if he had killed someone. Where are the Feds and the cops on this, right? They're the ones that got him dealing in the first place.
Ask yourself this. Where the fuck are they?
Would you believe a 15-year-old kid was working for the federal government?
But he was.
RICHARD: Listen, Ricky, this...
This might be our only chance of cutting a deal.
So let me do the talking.
Okay.
AGENT SNYDER: It's not a conspiracy, Rick.
We just can't say anything publicly.
Yeah, but I can. I go to the press, tell them
the Feds turned my son into a drug dealer,
that's headlines from now till Sunday. That's not a smart move.
Ricky's in a tough spot. I appreciate that. But we're not here to negotiate.
We don't have a lot of power here. This is not a federal case.
And the Bureau rejects any narrative that suggests
we encouraged Ricky to sell drugs.
He did that on his own, and he got caught.
And now he's facing a life sentence.
We want to offer Ricky an opportunity, maybe a way out.
RICHARD: What's he got to do?
We'd like to get an agent on the inside.
If you can do that, we can get some convictions...
Maybe we can return the favor. Those people ain't gonna talk to me.
AGENT BYRD: There is someone you could talk to.
Her father's close to Gil Hill, not to mention the mayor.
Cathy? Cathy's in a bad way.
She don't got nobody. Look, Rick, just talk to her.
Let her know that your Miami connect is coming into town,
needs protection for a large shipment.
You get her to meet him,
get the introduction to the father, and we'll take it from there.
You guys are going after Young, aren't you?
You're going after the mayor.
We have no intention of charging Cathy.
She's not our target. Just like Boo wasn't?
Boo ain't do shit, and y'all still got his ass locked up. (RICHARD SHUSHING)
RICHARD: Ricky, give this a chance, all right?
Listen up. Now, I understand you got feelings for this girl.
But this is about getting guys like Jackson, all right?
He's half the reason we're here in the first place.
I think it's worth a shot, Rick.
What do you think, champ?
I'll do whatever you say, Dad.
Okay.
We're gonna need something in writing, all right?
Some kind of contract.
I'm sorry, we can't do that, Rick.
I mean, if we have anything on paper, it's gonna look like
Ricky's just saying whatever he needs to, to stay out of jail. (SCOFFS)
So what the fuck are you saying?
I'm saying you have to trust us.
What you doing here, Rick?
You know I can't be seen with you.
I can't, Rick. I just need a minute, Cath. There's a big shipment, and I need help, Cath.
There's a big shipment, and I need help, Cath.

You have any questions?
Hey. Hey. I need to talk to you, Alex.

Listen, I got to be someplace, but come by the office No, no, I came by the office next week, we'll talk.
No, no, I came by the office next week, we'll talk. three times this week. Yeah. I know.
three times this week. Yeah. I know.
Well, what the fuck happened, Alex?
What do you want me to say? I mean, is anything I say gonna No, Ricky did his bit. make you feel any better?
No, Ricky did his bit. make you feel any better?
It's time for you to do yours. Okay. We're in a public place,
so I'm gonna need to ask you to keep your voice down.
(SOFTLY) Okay, what the fuck happened?
Okay, let's be clear. You were promised nothing.
You were told that the Bureau would make best efforts
with the court to mitigate Ricky's sentence.
We did that, the judge was not responsive.
"The judge was not responsive"? What the fuck is that?
That's what you're calling your best fucking effort? That's your answer?
I get that. No, you told me to trust you. You told me to trust you. You didn't do shit.
You told me to trust you. You didn't do shit. I have to go. Okay. You sold us out.
I'm leaving now. You sold us fucking out!
I really prefer to drink alone, Rick.
It's okay, Frank.
We're just a couple of guys on a day off, right?
It's not my day off.
Why's this happen to my son?
Just tell me the truth.
Well, you deal in narcotics, Why him?
you get busted. It's not true, Frank.
You know... God damn it, we had a deal.
I can't really square that circle for you, Rick.
Your boy was out. And he decided to get back in.
And you were not exactly an innocent bystander.
(SIGHS) You know, it's not about Ricky. It's not about his little friends.
It's not about kids selling dime bags on the corner.
We throw the little ones back, but when the big fish gets away,
they got to take what's left in the net.
So 'cause you don't get the fucking mayor, my kid goes down.
He's young.
He'll get out.
(ELECTRONIC CHIME) Come on, high five.
DAWN: Look, sweetie.
Look. It's your daddy.
Remember? From the picture?
The one we kiss each night with Mommy?
KEISHA: Hi, Daddy.
DAWN: Grandma misses you.
Hey, she'd have came, but, uh... Grandpa Ray's still not better.
We don't know if he's gonna get better, so...
How you doing, Dawn?
I hate that you're in here, Ricky.
I hate it.
Can I talk to her?
Hey, want to say, "Hello"?
(CHUCKLES) Aw! Hello.
She's tired.
Well, at least you haven't lost your looks. (BOTH CHUCKLE)
'Cause you never had 'em. (CHUCKLES)
Dawn? Yeah?
That picture.
Make sure you keep showing her.
(SOFTLY) Yeah.
Bye.
Bye-bye. (CHUCKLES) (KEISHA COUGHS)
(DAWN AND KEISHA LAUGH) DAWN: Oh! Let Grandpa have a go.
Hey, champ. Good to see you.
I got some good news.
Looks like they might overturn that 650 Lifer Law.
I talked to Byrd, and he said that he and Snyder
were willing to talk to the board if it comes to pass.
And if that happens, you could be up for parole in, like, you know, six years.
That is good news. They're not gonna get away with this, Ricky.
They're not gonna get away with this, Ricky.
You know, poked the lion one too many goddamn times.
All right, Dad. It's like we always talked about, son.
You got to lose a few battles to win the war.
We didn't talk about it. You did.
And the war is over.
No, it's not, son. Don't say that.
Look where I'm at. It's not over, you hear me?
It's like I'm dead in here. And that's how they want it.
Eight pounds, 14 ounces.
That's what you weighed when you were born.
Ricky, I remember the first time I looked in your eyes,
I knew you were gonna be bigger than me.
I knew your life was gonna be bigger than mine.
Not just in size, but in life, in heart, in spirit.
My life was hard, you know?
Not yours. Yours was gonna be easy.
Gonna be so goddamn easy.
And I fucked up.
And I'm sorry.
(SOFTLY) I'm so...
You're my best friend, Rick.
No, you're my only friend.
You just remember you got me and you got Dawn,
you got your daughter, all right? And we're not going anywhere.
We're always gonna be right here. All right?
Hey, it don't end like this. All right? Don't you give up on me.
Ricky, hey, it don't end like this.
We're lions. Hear me? We're lions.
I don't think there's a person RICK WERSHE JR.: that works here that thinks I belong in prison.
that works here that thinks I belong in prison.
You don't know, having that life sentence off of you,
the stress that it takes off of you
and the foot that's been on my chest for all these years.
This is my thirtieth birthday in prison, and, and it'll be the best one, so...
Oh, man, I feel overwhelmed with joy, man.
I mean, it's like, I swear to God, man, I feel, like, 10 years younger.
It's weird, like, so much weight's been lifted off of me.
"It's over. You're done. Michigan paroled you."
I cried, man.
I cried. (LAUGHS, SNIFFLES)
And I want to go tell my grandma and grandpa
that I made it out of prison, you know?
