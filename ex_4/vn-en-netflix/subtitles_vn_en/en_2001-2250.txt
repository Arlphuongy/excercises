What do all these people have in common?
They're all in search of a beautiful love story.
I'm the opposite.
Instead of looking for love, I'm running away from it.
And to avoid mishaps, I came up with three basic rules.
-How much? -Two reais.
The main rule: never lie.
I make my intentions very clear.
I think I have…
Sorry, man…
Rule two: no hanging out…
Hey, man.
…no sleepovers, no trips, no inviting her over. Forget it. Not happening.
Rule three: never let a relationship last longer than three months.
That's when things get passionate.
SUELLEN GLÓRIA ADDED YOU
And never ever let it get to six months. That's when you fall in love.
Trust me, these rules are foolproof. I've studied a lot to be a professional bachelor.
-Yeah? -Are you coming?
I'm on my way. Turn on the camera, let me see.
Do you think you're my husband? You're my lover.
I'll be there soon.
See you.
Be quick, I'm going to work.
Lina, don't forget our cocktail party tomorrow, okay?
I'll need you to be the perfect wife.
Darling, I'm the best.
Goodbye, love.
My wife!
Having lunch with your mistress, Pedro!
No, I was forced to come here!
That's true.
-Don't you talk… -I seduced Pedro!
-Yes! -Don't you talk to me, girl.
That's true.
You're a great cook.
Are those your siblings?
No. My daughter and my husband.
Your husband?
-I didn't want to be here. It's her fault. -I got him drunk!
I hate lies. You know I never lied to you, Soraya.
I never have a relationship for more than three months. And our three months end tomorrow.
-No! -I'll kill you!
Love is beautiful? No. LOVE PHASES - 1 - DESIRE 2 - PASSION - 3 - LOVE Love is a chemical revolution.
Out of the three phases of love,
only the first keeps people together: desire.
During phase two, passion,
your body releases lots of substances. It drives you crazy. MAY - SORAYA/LUNCH SORAYA/3 MONTHS
It's like a drug.
SUN 24 - MS. CARLOTA/BIRTHDAY THREE MONTHS SORAYA Phase three, love, releases the bonding hormones.
You can't live without each other. It's not for me.
What the… Ouch!
Good morning, Mom!
-You scared me! Stop it, Luiz. -You're so beautiful!
"Beautiful…" Don't you mean "good afternoon"?
You know, I saw on the news today
that the usual and healthy lifestyle for 13-year-old kids these days
is to open a channel on the Internet and move on.
They leave home to go live in their computers.
I don't know what's wrong with you.
What are you still doing in my house, son?
Mom, I'll never leave you like Dad did. I'll stay to take care of you.
Take care of me? You can barely take care of yourself.
I'm really busy today. CHATAPP MI - JULIA - BIA
Busy? You have no responsibilities, nothing to do.
Honestly, Luiz, you're shameless, inert, unemployed.
I won't be here forever, do you hear me?
Stop. Don't start with that. You're here now, about to turn 68.
-You're beautiful, in shape. -No…
You look like my sister.
Whose birthday's coming up? Who's having a party?
-I don't want a party. -Okay. Let's do something else?
Let's go to the beach, sit at the bar.
-Eat fish and fries. -I don't want to.
-Do you like potato? -I do.
-Do you like potato better than the beach? -Stop it, Luiz!
I was born in Rio, I've seen plenty of beaches.
I have to go. I'm begging you, Luiz, find yourself a wife.
No! No wife!
We've been through this!
Then find a job.
I won't be here forever, Luiz.
Love you, Mom.
Jeez, Maria Inez! I won't answer it. What a bore!
She calls me all the time. I will not answer it.
Damn it. What?
She gave up?
Maria Inez?
Listen, I told your brother that I don't want a party. What?
I HAVE MYSELF, YOU HAVE… AND WE HAVE ONE ANOTHER.
Hey, Júlio!
I… I'll be there in a few minutes.
It won't take long. There's a tunnel and I'll lose…
So, you're honest with her,
and she throws an apple at you?
Gosh.
People are so clingy these days, you know?
I…
I just want to have fun.
Studies show that single people live longer than married people.
And happier too.
That makes sense.
So,
here's to being single.
-Where have you been? -I can't speak.
-What? -I had an accident.
-You'll ruin everything. -We'll figure it out.
-What's with your hair? -It's a new style.
-Júlio! Good night. -Good night.
What a beautiful wife! What's your name?
It's Lina.
I really like your wife, Júlio. Such a smart woman.
You think? She's a little quiet and shy today.
That's what a smart woman does. She pleases her husband with her silence.
I can tell you're the boss in your family. I like that.
Cool.
I'm bringing you into our scheme. Let's have lunch tomorrow.
-Of course. -Nice.
JULIO ABREU (LOVER) EX-JULIO
EX-EDU (BOYFRIEND) EX-GIOVANA (GIRLFRIEND)
Have you heard? Ms. Ivone is dating a young guy.
He's young enough to be her son.
What's the big deal, Maria Inez?
It's hard to talk to Maria Eugênia, nothing's a big deal.
Is talking trash about people a real conversation?
What should I talk about? My life?
Do you want me to gossip about myself? I'm not stupid.
-I think… -See? Maria Clara agrees.
She doesn't. She's not square, her daughter is a lesbian.
-What? -Yes.
-I'm not square! -You're not?
For God's sake!
Can't you be quiet for a change?
Stop, Maria Inez! My God! This is our dessert.
-My favorite chef. -It's just a hobby, Mom.
-It's not a hobby. -His entire life is a hobby.
Luiz!
Oh no! Shrimp?
I'm allergic to shrimp.
I know.
He made shrimp, Mom. He knows I'm allergic to it.
What am I going to eat? Rice and farofa?
Make an egg for Maria Inez.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, look here. Come on!
-Make a wish, Mom. -Go ahead, Grandma.
Mom, what do you want the most in life?
Mom!
Mom!
-Mom! -Mom.
Mom!
It'll be all right.
-What if Mom dies? -It'll be all right.
There she is. What's wrong, Mom? Tell us.
-What's wrong? -Tell us.
-Dr. Edmar had his suspicions. -Mom!
-But we needed some tests to confirm. -Right. And?
Tell us, Mom. I've got six months to live.
-What? -Come again!
Where is it written here?
You never said anything, now you come up with this?
For God's sake, be quiet!
Mom, you can't die. Okay?
Why can't I die? Everybody can but me?
I don't want you to leave us, Mom!
But I am, Maria Inez. I'm already gone. Please, Mom. You can't leave me alone.
I really can't. God, my boy can't do anything.
Yeah, I can't do anything.
I have a last wish for you. I'll do anything.
-Then I'll go in peace on my next journey. -Don't say that, Mom!
I hope there's one. My wish, son,
is for you
to find a wife.
We've been through this, Mom. You know me.
It doesn't pan out for me. You know me.
Please. If you die, I'll die too, Mom.
-That works for me. -Why?
-Because I'm cutting you out of my will. -Take it easy, Mom.
What? Why are you doing this now?
Are you punishing me?
Unlike your sisters, you won't have kids to inherit my assets.
So, you're out of my will.
All right.
If that's your last wish,
I'll do it.
I'll get married.
-What? -Shut up, Maria Inez! Okay?
My baby boy.
I'm so happy, baby.
I think it's time. I've met a girl and we… I just think it's too soon!
He's lying, Mom! He's bluffing!
-Don't pick on your brother. -God!
-He can make mistakes, but he's no liar. -It's true. You'll get to meet her.
Who? What's her name?
He doesn't even know her name!
I don't wanna say.
Please, respect him! That's how he processes things.
He'll introduce her to us at the right moment.
-Mom! -Won't you, my love? My God.
Come here, Maria Inez.
Hello?
Helô, hi. Long time no see.
Hi, stranger.
Hey, Ilana. It's Luiz.
You deleted my number? Luiz. Hi, Isa. I need a big favor.
No, I understand. Okay.
So, I was the problem.
All right.
I need to see you.
I have a special request.
I want you to marry me.
It's not just about the sex, or a physical thing.
Don't get me wrong, you're very attractive.
But I know you deeply.
And, deep down, you're not bad.
Maybe better than on the surface. Are you trying to marry me or scare me off?
I'm giving you the chance of a better, happier life.
A lot of people live a pretend life.
They need to think we're a couple. We'll keep our lovers…
-What? -Of course.
Who do you think I am?
You're Nestor, my best friend!
The thing is that's my rustic little hand already has a ring on it.
Nestor, this is a win-win. I think you need a girl, dude.
I need a brother who will get me out of this situation.
I need you. I can pay you.
-Nice. -Nice?
-Nice! -Of course, man! Give me a kiss.
-Get off me. Are you crazy? -You're my man!
-I knew I could count on you. -Do you remember Júlio Abreu?
-Júlio Abreu… -Yes.
-The journalist? -Yeah.
-His latest story is on fire. -On fire!
-You know he's gay, right? -Right.
He hired a fake wife to get into the conservative guys' scheme. Look.
She's hot, man.
-Is she an actress? -What?
A stage actress. He said she was great.
The kind of girl you bring home on holidays to meet the family.
-Get her number with Júlio. I'll call her. -Trust me, bro.
Cave painting.
Cave painting.
The first kissing scene ever recorded in the world.
And you thought it was in Hollywood, right?
This isn't going to work, Nestor. I don't lie to women, how will I lie to my mom?
-You don't lie to your dates. -No.
Mom is not a date. Try again.
You have a point.
It was our first step beyond experiencing love.
We started to mimic love.
Getting to romantic comedies was just a matter of time. And technology too.
Lina! Nice, but we're leaving.
-Thanks. -Let's go.
Be cool, just chat her up.
"I need your services." "Services."
UNKNOWN CALLER
-Hi, Ms. Lina. -Look at this, Isaías.
-They called ten times. -That's a lot.
"Your data plan has expired."
They just want to rub it in. Of course I know it's expired.
What a loser. The bills beat us up, then come back for our dignity.
What are we having for lunch?
We have beef, but our fish dishes are a hit.
Are they?
SPECIAL! TEN REAIS! TODAY I'll have that salami. Half serving. Artist's special.
Answer it, Ms. Lina. It could be good news.
UNKNOWN CALLER
Pick it up, girl.
Hello?
Who is it? I can barely hear you.
Depending on who this is, I hear even less.
-Hello? -Hi. Is Lina there?
It's about a job.
A job? Just a moment…
-Work, man? -Lina, darling! It's a call for you.
Thank you, Grandma…
Salamita.
This is Lina Maia. How can I help you?
Hi.
I need to hire a wife.
You're talking with the best.
Let me check my schedule, okay?
Hold on.
Today is your lucky day, my friend.
My movie has just been released. I have an opening.
It's more like a chasm.
My place in two hours?
Write down the address.
Luiz?
-What's up? -Lina Maia, actress.
Cool. May I?
I'm sorry. Don't mind me. It's my character development process.
I do some stretching, some warm-ups, act as if I were on stage.
Sit down, please.
So, let's talk.
What kind of couple do you need?
Just a regular couple, mature people.
A couple like that doesn't sell well. Messy couples look real.
But I'm a centered man.
I'm pretty peaceful, but I have no experience.
I'm a pro. I've been married five times.
I also played animals.
If you want something more like Nala and Simba…
-Nala and Simba? -I can do that.
Right, follow me.
How to create a love story? How did we meet? In detail.
I bought you a drink at a club. We spent the night together.
Luiz, I want romance. A carnival.
Do you even go?
We met at your friend's house and talked about a movie.
Fight Club.
Fight Club.
Best sex we've had? Hold on. My mom won't ask about that.
There's always an uncle asking about your sex life.
-DTR? -I'm an easygoing guy, you know?
Pretty cool.
One's coolness can trigger another's rage. Let's rehearse.
These are the lines. You start it off, and then we take turns.
You, me, you, me…
"You lied to me."
Let's try again, a little more natural.
Loosen up. Pretend you're not reading it.
All right. Go.
No.
"You lied to me?"
It was for your own good.
-"Forgive me." -No, that one is mine.
-Right. -Remember when I said…
"I was deceived for my own good?"
-What the hell? -It's an exercise. Let's go.
Have a nice life.
-That one was dope, right? -Let's…
Sure. Let's repeat it a lot.
The body speaks. Hands towards the sky make people trust you.
It's a primitive message that says you're unarmed.
Does it work?
A TV host does that for years, and it works.
But he also throws airplane-shaped money to people. I'm coming!
Fill in this form, please.
You either vacate my place or pay the late rent.
Urgently! My situation is urgent.
I'm in the ICU of debt. Do you understand, Ms. Hortênsia?
I'm slowly dying in the ICU of debt!
Your eviction notice expires in 15 days. Fifteen days!
-There. -All right, let's make this work.
One color.
I don't know. You ask too many questions.
Can we speed this up?
I need five dates in six months.
The most important is the annual Pereira family reunion. Can we do that?
-Six months. Deal. -Great.
-I'll be the perfect wife. -Great.
I can be whoever you want.
-Mom would like her to be a lawyer. -Yes, Your Honor.
A tennis player.
Your dad owns a farm, your mom, a sugar plant. Bilingual.
-Oui! -Okay?
And remember, you're a Catholic.
-Amen. -You don't drink alcohol.
Juice, please.
-What the hell are you wearing? -Good afternoon.
-What the hell are you wearing? -Good afternoon. -Criticizing your fiancée's outfit, love? -Isn't it too much?
-Criticizing your fiancée's outfit, love? -Isn't it too much? -Says who? The Sexist Fashion Week? -Quiet!
-It won't work. -It will.
Let's get to work. Listen. A couple's privacy is sacred.
If you're in trouble, just say "kiss".
-And we'll talk in private. -Okay.
Or lean over to kiss me and whisper in my ear.
-The kiss is fake. This way? -Yes.
You have to pay him. Wait here! How much was it?
-I like this girl already! -Nice to meet you. Lina.
-It's so nice to meet you. -Thanks.
-Beautiful house. -Thanks.
Get us a drink, Luiz. A liqueur, maybe.
Lina doesn't drink alcohol, Mom.
Yes, but I'll make an exception today.
Great!
Tell me. What do you do for a living? I'm a doctor.
-A doctor? -Here, Mom.
That's awesome. She's a doctor.
Has Luiz told you about my health condition?
I want your opinion.
-What are you doing? Mom's dying. -How did you not tell me that?
It's hard. I can't open up about it yet.
-My character needed to know that. -Why you…
Here.
Please, give me your honest opinion.
This is the scan.
I want you to…
-It's upside down. -What?
Please, be honest with me.
What do you think?
I think it's so sad.
My three Marias are here!
Come here.
I want to kiss you. -And kiss you good. -Be serious.
You were supposed to be a lawyer.
It'll be fine.
Lawyer, doctor, they all have a diploma.
Listen to me. You'll ruin everything.
-For God's sake, this has to work. -It will, trust me.
The lovebirds want privacy.
I brought you a chocolate cake.
-I don't like chocolate cake. -I know.
That's because he used to eat dirt as a child. Idiot!
Idiot.
Girls.
-Look at him. -The house special.
-He does that. -My favorite dish.
-He always rocks! -It looks delicious!
-That was the first thing he said to me. -He's such a great cook.
-He is, isn't he? -You'll never have to cook again.
So, where did you two meet?
-At the carnival. -At Nestor's.
-What? -Well…
We were at Nestor's. It was his son's birthday, and we went to the carnival.
-Yes. -Right?
-Luiz and I were a match right away. -That's right.
-Really? -Yes.
We're together because we like fights. Isn't it crazy? We like the same movie.
-Rocky… Club. -Fight Club.
Lina knows all the fighting movies. She likes them all.
Stop, don't expose me. But, yes, I love them.
They're all about virile men, and the fighting.
I like that. I like men a lot.
What did you say?
No. I'm talking about martial arts, honey.
That was awkward.
-Talking about men like that? -Luiz!
-Gosh! Are you jealous now? -It's not that.
It came out wrong.
-It came out terribly. -Says the TED Talk badass.
-Whose ass? -Google it!
-No, never mind. -Listen, honey.
Don't worry about that. What matters is that you're here.
Let's set the wedding date as soon as possible.
I'd be so happy.
That'd be great, baby.
-That's all we want, right? -Sure.
You can't get married in a leap year.
Is this a leap year?
-You can't get married in a leap year. -Right?
It's bad luck.
We're actually aiming for January 4th.
In the church, by the book.
Lina is a devout Catholic.
-Lovely. -She's worth her weight in gold.
Speaking of gold, you know he doesn't work, right?
For me, that's perfect.
I spend so much time at the hospital. So, having him at home is perfect.
That's right. I work on different things,
like self-awareness. You should try that sometime.
The Oracle of Delphi once said, "Know thyself."
Did he say, "Provide for thyself," by chance?
-Listen. -Do you want to take a picture?
-No. -Let's do it.
I'd like your phone number. I'll add you to the family group chat.
It's such an honor.
I like Luiz's idea, let's take a picture.
-Good idea. -Great.
-I can't see myself. -Cheers!
Hold on, Maria Eugênia!
I'll have another piece of cake.
Samir is here. Goodbye, everyone.
Good luck to the couple. You'll need it.
And I'm going to take my baby for a ride.
-I'll go get the car keys. -Okay.
-Tell me, Lina. What's your specialty? -Yes.
-"Blatriatics." -Sorry?
Pediatrics?
-Wow! Can I ask you something? -That's cool!
Going to your fiancée's house? No, we're going out.
-Move over, Samir. -What's wrong?
-Move! -What happened? Calm down.
Ouch, my hemorrhoids! Wait, what happened?
They're so happy about this engagement. Big deal! I got married first.
-It's so unfair. -I was the baby.
Dad used to say, "Dance for the guests, Inezinha."
Then this creep shows up.
-It was lovely to meet you. -Thank you.
-Your family is amazing. -Thank you.
-Nice house. -You're always welcome here.
-Let's go. Thanks, Mom. -What a beautiful couple.
-Take a piece of cake. -She's on a diet. Bye.
It was all about him. "Luiz can say 'Mommy'."
-I said it before him. -And way better than him, I'm sure.
"Those are his first steps." I thought,
"If that creep can walk, I'm going to do somersaults."
I bet you were great.
I did gymnastics and athleticism. What did I get?
-A gold medal? -A missing tooth.
That rehearsal was a waste of time.
"No, Luiz, let's do this, let's do that."
You did everything wrong.
-You messed it up. -I didn't mess up.
-Didn't you? -I was improvising. I'm an actress.
Yes, you're a lame actress. That's what you are.
He who laughs last, laughs best. He'll give himself away eventually.
Do you think I'll let him do that?
I'll expose him myself.
I won't go anywhere with you.
I'm surely taking you home. I'm seeing Suellen Glória tonight.
-Who's stopping you? -I rescheduled to rehearse with you. A waste of time.
You called me lame. You've never even seen my work.
-Of course you're going home. -"Lame."
Hey, Luiz!
Your sister wants to celebrate with you.
Double date!
I can't take you home.
SUELLEN GLÓRIA ACCEPT
I can't stand her up. Please, help me.
-Me? -Please.
-My shift is over. -I'll pay you double.
I'll have champagne.
Suellen Glória is at that bar.
I need you to cover for me, so I can be at both.
Okay.
Who would've thought we'd ever see Luiz in love? I never saw that coming.
-You must be a very special girl. -Come on.
-Thanks. -I agree.
-We deserve champagne. -Sure! Special occasion.
-Thanks. -I'll have this one. Le… Lecle…
-Lecleique. -Leclerc.
-That one, the most expensive. -I'll have one too.
Excuse me. I think I left the car lights on.
-Samir can go with you. -Sure.
I turned them off.
-Thanks. -Don't mention it.
Don't you have an important call to make?
-It just came to me. -Yes, I do.
-I'll go somewhere quieter. -Okay.
I'm coming too. I have to call our son. You know what?
-I can make the call later. -Yes.
Let's have champagne.
-I'll call them later. -Stay here with us.
Are you keeping a secret, Luiz? You look nervous.
No, I'm cool. I have nothing to hide.
SUELLEN GLÓRIA ACCEPT
Tell us the hot details of your relationship.
I'm a modern woman. I can't. I'm too shy.
Give me a kiss, honey. I want a kiss.
Watch the performance
of this lame actress here.
Cool.
Maria Inez, Luiz is really keeping a secret.
-He is? -But it's not from you. It's from me.
You lied to me!
Come again.
You lied to me!
It was for your own good.
I was deceived for my own good?
Keep it down. Everybody is looking.
Forgive me.
What?
Forgive me.
Have a nice life.
-I'll go after her. -We will too.
-Samir, finish that fish. -No.
Eat your fish.
I'll deal with that later.
-Suellen Glória? -Yes?
I'm Maria Inez. Luiz's sister.
Is he all right?
He has appendicitis.
He wouldn't let go of his phone… Excuse me.
He kept yelling, "I have a date with Suellen Glória!"
He said you'd be here. Hold on. So, he was sedated…
-Champagne, please. -Sure.
Thank you.
And I decided to come tell you in person.
Thank you so much.
-Don't mention it. -How thoughtful.
-No, I mean it. -It was nothing.
Mom is very religious.
She's always picking on my husband, Samir.
Waiter!
You don't drink, do you?
-I don't. -I respect that. It's sophisticated.
Well, I'm not sophisticated, so…
I'll have just one more. Waiter.
Suellen Glória hopes you get well soon.
She's sweet. I'll charge extra, she talks too much.
An extra? You can forget about it.
I won't give you any more money.
See you.
Good morning, Mommy!
-My queen. -Gosh! Look at that!
The engagement is doing you good.
You got up early.
I was tired. I needed to rest, you know?
I'm spending the day with you, my queen.
I don't want sad faces. I'm happy you're getting married.
-So am I. -And so am I.
What is she doing here?
Surprise, honey! I came for breakfast.
Dinosaurs, that's cute.
I invited her to have breakfast with us.
I have an engagement gift for you.
My dear mother-in-law, you shouldn't… You shouldn't have come.
I'm being polite. And I can't afford to decline a gift or extra work.
I'm not paying extra. I didn't invite you here.
She's coming. And you'll pay every penny of my overtime.
-What's this, Mom? -Open it.
-What key is this? -That key is to our family condo
-that I want you two to have. -I can't accept…
Ms. Carlota, thank you so much!
I appreciate it so much. I mean, we appreciate it as a couple.
And so will Carlotinha, our first daughter.
-She'll take her granny's name. -Oh my God!
Thank you so much, Mom.
-Can I call you "Mom"? -Of course, honey.
Group hug!
Your sister's nosy. Living together makes it easier to hide things from her.
I heard you say you were being evicted. I'm not stupid. You're taking advantage of this.
What's wrong with that? I'm here on business.
No.
I hired a five-date pack, not a full-time wife.
We need to discuss the wage for my 24/7 shift,
no days off, plus night pay for sleeping at work.
Have you been drinking? Do you think I want all this?
-Looks good, right? -It's darker there.
When it dries… Have you ever painted a wall? So, it's not done.
But we agreed on one part-time wife, right?
Excuse me. We're done.
Great! Come here, please.
Part-time marriage sounds good, huh?

Humanity is always three drinks behind reality, said Humphrey Bogart.
-Who's that? -What?
You don't know?
-Are you judging me? -No, I'm not.
Let's send her a picture. Come.
-Now? No fingers. -No, go ahead.
-This is the right pose for her. -Here we go.
Luiz and Lina in our group chat.
They look adorable! Your BP is lower.
Really? It's lower, that's great. Hand me my phone, Maria Inez.

a beautiful
couple!
A three-part message.
-What a cute little mommy! -That's my mom.
Let's do the couple's paint war. It's a classic, never gets old.
Is that our family's condo?
I gave it to them.
Oh!
-I'm going to pass out. -What's wrong, Maria Inez?
-Take it easy. -Help me, Dr. Edmar.
-Don't be dramatic. -Relax.
-Let's send her a nude? -People believe accidental nudes.
-I'll send it, wait, then delete it. -Exactly.
They're sending naughty pictures in our group.
What?
They're sending nudes? They deleted it.
-You look better. -She really does.
A lot better.
What a gorgeous view. Enjoy it. This gig won't last forever.
It's the time I need to see if I'm staying in São Paulo.
How did you start with this…
-Wife for hire? -You read my thoughts.
It took you long enough to ask me about that.
Yeah, I never asked.
I had bills to pay.
What other characters have you played?
All sorts of animals and plants in children's plays.
Right, for kids.
I've also been a daughter, sister, lover.
Why would anyone hire a fake lover?
Listen up.
-The guy was busted. -Right.
So, I pretended to be his lover and apologized to his wife.
She punched me in the jaw. It still hurts.
-Really? -Feel it.
-Get out! -Mission accomplished.
-You're good at this. -You're better.
You have money and no job. I can barely get by.
How about education? Did you go to college?
-I did. -Did you?
I was promising.
A promise that was never fulfilled, but I was promising.
So, another toast. That makes the two of us.
-Two failed promises. -That's me.
But my monologue is coming up.
And the countdown starts.
If nothing works out, I'll gather my stuff, which is not much,
go back home and end my acting career.
Where are you from?
Far away.
Norway? Are you from Norway?
Norway, really?
Come over here. You're sleeping on the floor, the sofa is worse.
-Sleep over here. -No, stop it.
I never spend the night with women. I'm following the rules.
I'm not complaining. I'm fine here. This is my spot, okay?
Are you awake?
Lina?
What the hell?
SAT 30 - JUNE
Heterosexual love stories
have an impenetrable barrier.
Men.
-Good morning. -Men.
-An impenetrable… -Mom is coming over.
She wants to see if you're taking care of her son.
An impenetrable barrier. Men.
She brought these cleaning products, so you can do the housework.
You do the housework. Or hire someone.
I've never done that, I won't start now.
I hired you. I pay you with my allowance, you clean up.
I was hired as an actress, and in terrible working conditions.
This house is a mess, there's no coffee, no catering.
You're a lame actress.
-Heterosexual love stories… -Lame actress! I hired you as a wife.
Do you know which organ works solely to give pleasure?
No, I don't know.
I'm not talking to you, I'm rehearsing.
Of course you don't. It's the clitoris.
What does that mean?
That I have better things to do than cleaning up Luiz Pereira's house.
Luis Pereira…
I'll clean here.
It's really dirty in here.
Mom will come over tomorrow.
Okay.
WED 8 - AUGUST I missed a call from your mom. She texted me saying she can't make it.
-Again? -Yes.
WED 30 - AUGUST
What's up?
Wow!
Since Mom didn't come… Want some?
Of course!
It's much better.
Mom learned to make video calls. She seems happy.
I think she'll die peacefully. Since she's not here, and my sister isn't bugging me,
what did Luiz do? He invited himself to visit Suellen Glória.
Cool. So, you're not coming to my monologue opening night.
Tonight.
Gosh…
-I can't stand her up again. -Right. Don't worry.
-I haven't had sex for two months. -It's your loss.
It's not my loss. Look.
-I don't like all that yelling. -Actors don't yell.
We project our voices. Screw you!
Projected. Not yelled.
Hello?
-Hey, baby. -Hi.
I can't believe this.
Let me call you back.
Perhaps the secret ingredient
of the best love stories…
is two big servings of solitude.
I have myself,
you have yourself,
and we have one another.
Hey. Let me get this straight.
Maria Inez was spying on you with binoculars.
-And drinking soda? -I'm not crazy.
-Please, Luiz! -Don't you have anything to tell me?
-Like what? -You're acting weird.
-I'm not acting weird. -Yes, you are.
I'm not.
-Is it 'cause I didn't go to your opening? -I was mad, but not anymore.
I see.
Grapes are fruit. And doctors recommend one glass before dinner.
Well, I drink one week's worth in a day.
-Please, split the charge in two cards. -What?
Did you bang your head? How about my benefits?
-Transportation, meal voucher… -Vacation!
As domestic workers,
we're entitled to benefits like any other worker.
That's right, comrade!
I'm tired of cleaning, and ironing, and cooking.
I'm freaking sick of it!
Heard that? I don't even have my wallet.
-It's like I paid her to say that to you. -That was ridiculous.
-But the shoe fit. It did! -She was yelling. "The shoe fit…"
Funny is that I am the homemaker. You just sit around all day.
That's true.
I have to admit, that's true.
But I'll redeem myself by taking you out to lunch. My treat!
Oh my.
-You have to relax. -Sure, because things are going so well.
Blackmailed by my mom, stalked by my sister, exploited by my fake wife. I really should relax.
I meant romantically, like having someone for casual sex, a hookup.
A hookup?
Really? Look who's telling me that.
You have no one. Give me a break.
-Priorities, hon. -Come on!
I'm in a creative process phase, I can't waste my energy on sex.
My pal Honoré de Balzac, writer, never had sex while writing a book.
Man, don't even bring that up.
Why don't you invite Suellen over?
Rule number two, never invite a woman over.
Fine. You can have sex next year.
That's too far away. I can't wait until next year.
-You think? -Yeah.
I'll go to a friend's house to give you privacy.
What friend?
-I've never seen you with a friend. -I have plenty of friends.
Sure you do. They live in library shelves, and were born in the 1800's.
That's funny.
-That's a joke. I see. -Yeah.
Why don't you mind your own messed-up life?
Fine, Suellen Glória may come over. But…
you have to be there.
What if my sister shows up?
I'll have to pretend I'm Maria Inez.
But I'd be lying to Suellen Glória.
It's perfect!
You're so sweet! It was nice of you to bring this…
this… this bush.
It's actually a tree of happiness.
I planted male and female seeds.
They represent your love and bond.
Luiz, if you don't marry Suellen, who is glorious,
then I will!
Didn't you say you're married when we met?
He's gone.
Samir is gone.
He left so much debt behind, you could say he is dead.
But he isn't, he just left.
Luiz took me in.
-I'm sorry I brought this up. -Don't worry.
I'm going to have fun tonight!
Luiz is our super chef.
Yeah. You can get married now.
I should tell you.
I don't usually keep a relationship…
With whoever crosses his path. He's picky.
But I can assure you that Luiz is a keeper.
Maria Inez!
Can you help me? Please.
-I can help. -Leave it to Maria Inez.
Leave it to me, dear.
Darling girl.
There's a nice bed in there for you.
What… Hold on, I…
I really have to go.
No way! You can sleep over.
It's a nice day to have sex, huh? There's the bedroom.
No, I've got to get up early.
I ride my bike in the morning.
You can ride this.
Oops! A road full of speed bumps.
Thanks, but I really should go.
But you're already here.
Bye. Nice seeing you. We'll have another chance.
How many people are having sex now? About a million.
I looked it up for my play. One million orgasms.
Nope. It's 514,000.
Because only 75% of men and 25% of women will reach climax.
The things I learn from you.
You're nuts.
You're totally nuts.
I take this opportunity
to announce to São Paulo…
Step away.
…that Luiz doesn't need to pay me anymore.
Wait, what?
That's all.
-All right! I'm glad to hear it. -I know you are.
In exchange,
you'll cook at an event where I'm going to perform.
-No way. No! -Too late, they're counting on you.
I've already sold our "Better Half Combo."
-It's a bachelorette party. -What?
This is not going to work. I'm not a chef.
If you fake it long enough, you'll become one.
-Remember? -Yes.
Hello.
Chef Luiz Pereira, this is Paula, the bride.
Oi.
Have we met before?
No.
I'd definitely remember you.
Excuse us, Chef. I'll show you where I'll perform.
-Soraya! -Hi.
Let me introduce our chef. The bride's mother…
Where is he? He was right here.
-Never mind. Let's go. -Sure.
Yes…
-What are you doing? -You scared me!
A bunch of my hookups are here.
-What do you mean? -Look.
Catarina, Cecília, and Soraya, who happens to be the bride's mother!
Don't you dare leave this kitchen!
You can always expect some shit after a "but".
-It's true. -Right?
"Yeah, love, but I'm not like the other guys."
"I have a mother."
"I have a sister." What?
"I listen to women."
As if it were some sort of special skill, right?
That women are…
Women are like ghosts.
They can haunt you all of a sudden.
Women can easily find you, catch you!
They'll find you behind the curtain!
Hiding away!
Luiz?
Soraya!
I need to check the food, it's going to burn.
Chef, the appetizers are a hit.
Yes, the appetizers.
Let's keep them coming, okay?
That's great.
You nearly…
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. …destroyed my marriage.
You scoundrel! Come over here.
I almost lost my stupid husband because of you!
You son of a…
-Hi! -What?
You should see your faces.
That was great.
Give it up for our actor chef, and for the bride's mother,
who was the star of our little prank.
Bravo!
She didn't tell me anything. It was great.
It was a surprise, dear.
Featuring our actor, trained in Japan by Professor Ikillyou.
Get lost.
Let's give it up for the bride's mother. She nailed it!
What an actress!
And a round of applause for our chef, who, sadly, is not on the menu.
Back to the cave painting…
TUE 3 - SEPTEMBER BETTER HALF COMBO - 50TH ANNIVERSARY
THU 5 WEDDING
SAT 7 BAPTISM
WED 11 BACHELOR PARTY
TUE 17 BETTER HALF COMBO - DIVORCE PARTY
I don't believe it. Your sister isn't here, crazy man.
That's what you think. She's cunning, that one. Trust me.
You have to go out, have some fun. Forget about your sister.
I spent the money I had left on pots and pans. Mom has cut off my allowance.
The disease might affect her memory. -It was me, actually. -You what?
-It was me, actually. -You what? I told her you're earning your own money now.
-Why'd you do that? -You should've seen how happy she was.
I can lend you money. How much?
How would you lend me anything? We make the same wage,
and you spend twice as much. What's left to lend?
I wasn't aware we were married for real.
-Wait. -You should've told me.
Relax.
Unbelievable.
I'm taking you to a sister-free party tonight.
-Party? -Yes, you're paranoid.
Maria Inez! Over there.
Hello!
This party is for actors.
With these masks on, we can flirt with everyone.
We? What about your abstinence?
My monologue is ready, baby. It's time to get some action.
Let's hit the bar.
I'll find someone to kiss right now.
They put a ladder in the middle of the catwalk.
Can you imagine that? How could I climb it in those heels?
I pretended it was part…
of the choreography.
-I don't get in trouble. -What? That's all you ever talk about.
I don't get in trouble because I don't wait for it to happen.
-But you build up a situation. -No, that's the thing.
-I don't cause trouble, I run from it. -You're the trouble.
-I can't tell you… -I go…
Unlike other guys, I never lie to women.
-I'm different, that's all. -Don't confuse your flaws with the truth.
-Said my girl Clarice Lispector. -What is my flaw?
Not wanting to fall in love just to walk out on my family like my father did? Is that a flaw?
-Can I be honest? -Please.
The more you deny it, the more you become like him.
Get out of here! It's settled. Passion won't rule my life.
-Love is what leads everybody's lives. -Not mine.
Whether finding it or running from it, it's always about love.
Not mine.
We met three months ago.
-Already? -You know what that means?
No? We'd be in the passion phase.
-The second phase of love. -Yeah.
-"My darling." -Baby talk.
-"You're my baby." -"My baby."
-"You're the love of my life." -"Cute."
-"You're so cute." -"My sweetie."
-Pathetic! -Ridiculous!
Mom has only three months to live. Her time is almost up.
So is ours.
Thank goodness!
Not because she'll die, but because we'll finally be free.
-We'll go our separate ways. -Yeah!
-It's been three months already. -Yeah.
-I can't wait. -We'll be free.
I'm happy to have met you.
So am I.
I'm going to bed. I'm exhausted.
I'll stay a little longer.
I'm having lunch with my mom tomorrow.
I think she's been avoiding me.
You'll see a different woman from what she used to be.
Good night.
Mom?
Mom!
Mom!
I dozed off, son.
I missed you so much, my love.
Let me take a look at you.
Did you bring me flowers?
Are you all right?
I'm great!
Let's get some lunch. I'm starving.
I have to say, since you left home,
I've never touched that stove again.
But you loved cooking.
I hated cooking. Always have.
I still don't know who you got that from.
But I'm so proud of you for becoming a chef.
Let's eat.
Are we eating from the box?
They're biodegradable. Throwing them away makes trees sprout.
-My friend from yoga told me. -Friend from yoga?
She's in the GeriaTrip, our vibrant group of senior girls.
We hop on a van and go everywhere.
You know, son,
death
can teach you a lot about life.
Dr. Edmar told me that.
I can see that.
Poor man. He's a widower, so lonely.
We invited him to our group. He's the only man among us girls.
It's good to have a doctor around.
It's great. He just gave me a ride home on his motorcycle.
Motorcycle?
He said he's pretty sure I'm going to be here on January 4th.
Mom, that's great news!
I'm so happy!
I'll be here for your wedding!
-It's great. -Yeah.
I broke my rules, man. Every single one of them.
They're falling apart.
-Why are you whispering? -Quiet!
Maria Inez is not here. I'm worried about you.
My mom was about to die, man.
All of a sudden, she comes back from the ashes.
I'm engaged to an actress. Awesome.
I don't get laid in three months. Hey, that's awesome too.
Brother, just grab a girl,
drive up to the hills and camp over there with her.
-My sister is on my tail. -Relax!
It's too far, she won't even bother.
My mother-in-law hated it. Fine. Where is it?
It's a two-hour drive. It's beautiful up there, look.
-A tent here, a fire there. -Where's it?
Hey!
-What's up? -What is that? Going camping?
Nestor gave me an idea.
He got me thinking, you know?
I realized I need some time off
to clear my mind.
So, I'm taking a romantic trip to the hills. Care to come?
On a romantic trip?
Yeah, it does sound a little weird.
But this whole situation with the fake wedding
has been changing my mind.
It made me consider the possibility of a real relationship.
Yeah…
And I've got Suellen Glória.
She's beautiful, kind, smart.
So, I asked her. Right, Suellen Glória. And you want me to come along?
Right, Suellen Glória. And you want me to come along? You need to. You have to be there.
Maria Inez would suspect us if you stayed.
And Mom would love to see romantic pictures of us, in the woods, among the trees.
How'll you explain my presence to Suellen Glória?
I'm sorry for separating you two, but I feel sick in the back seat.
-It's fine. -"Feel sick".
This trip will help you forget the troubles with your husband.
-It'll be great. -I'll get over it.
Awesome.
-Let's see if you guys know this one. -Hit it.
-If you need to build a dam -…to build a dam
-I've got… -I've got a beaver
-If you need to build a dam -If you need to build a dam
-I've got… -I've got the wood
-How do you even know this one? -How do you?
-It's so ridiculous. -It's good.
-It's here, right? -Looks like it.
So, we're here.
Are you sure I'm not the third wheel?
I am. Actually, I feel more comfortable with you here.
I've never taken a girl on a trip.
And now you're taking two. You don't count.
You have to see what's inside. She's a doctor, she has a Law degree,
tennis state champion, polyglot, doesn't drink alcohol.
What else do you want?
How about inside? Her kidneys, her gallbladder, an ingrained grudge?
You're being silly.
You can't see it, can you?
You've become the romantic type you've always feared.
-I'm not. -You are.
Look at your face.
-You think I'm in love with her? -Let me close it. Move.
Get out of the way.
-In love… -You think so?
Idiot.
-What? -Come here.
-Put this on. -I'm coming.
You too, Maria Inez. There are mosquitoes here. I made it.
You made it?
Yes, it's 100% natural.
She made it.
-Be careful with the vines. -Thanks.
-I'll carry that for you. -Thanks.
Nature is so perfect.
There's a lake too.
Beware of the ants.
But… Oh no.
Be careful around the fire.
Look at that! Good job!
It looks great.
-Cool. -Looks nice, right?
I'm surprised. You nailed it.
Let's get inside.
-It's dark, it's late. -Okay.
We need some rest.
-Let's go. -But now?
-Yeah, now. -We just got here.
Come in.
It's probably just a little hawk. Come here.
-It sounds like a wild pig. -It does, right?
Don't scare me!
-Look! -No!
No…
What's that?
-I'm going outside. -What? No!
Are you crazy?
-Stay in here. -Don't leave me alone.
-I'm so sorry. -No!
I have a good reason. I'm sorry.
-What do you want? -I have a bad feeling about Mom.
-Will you pray with me? -No, get out of here.
-She just lost her husband, Luiz. -I lost my husband.
-Luiz. -I want to make love.
I called you because we need to take pictures for your mom.
Now? When I was about to get laid?
-The night was a mess. -Really?
I hibernated. Like a bear.
The lake is a nice setting. Hurry up, my battery is almost dead.
I like it here.
God, I can't believe this. They're so weird.
MARIA INEZ ACCEPT
Hi, Maria Inez.
-Lina? -Lina? No, it's Suellen Glória.
Suellen Glória?
Yes. Luiz's girlfriend.
Is this Maria Inez? Luiz's sister? I am Maria Inez.
And you're being played. We all are.
Looks good, right?
-It was here. -Where are our things?
-What… -Is this the wrong campsite?
No!
The fire was…
-Suellen Glória? -What's that over there?
What does it say?
-Doctor's handwriting. -It's a freaking ECG.
Forget it. We can't read this.
Suellen Glória!
Where's my car?
-My phone is dead. Where's yours? -Damn!
Oh my God!
My phone was in the tent.
I feel butterflies in my stomach.
But if I were in love, I'd be sad that she's gone.
And I'm not.
Yes, I guess.
I'm not sure.
How come? You've had lots of relationships.
If you don't know, who does?
All my husbands were fake.
But in real life, I've had a few boyfriends.
How do you know so much about relationships?
I learned it from books, movies, plays…
So, you, too, know it in theory only.
What's love like in real life? I mean, in practice.
In practice, love is two "solitudes" that protect and greet each other.
It is cold.
A friend of mine said that. Rainer Maria Rilke.
Don't you have any real friends?
You. Aren't you my friend?
You are.
It is cold.
It's nice that you have a big family.
The bond you all have.
I've always been lonely.
I've been pretty lonely too. I've felt lonely.
Unlike everybody else.
For the first time, I feel like I have a real partner.
Someone like me.
You should let women know you up close.
You're more handsome than from afar.
And from afar, you're… Holy shit!
You're a captivating character.
-We're great together, aren't we? -We are.
-We're great together, aren't we? -We are. The world can't hold us.
-Who said that? -A friend of mine.
-Yeah? -Yeah. Homer.
Homer?
-Homer Simpson. -No.
No, come on.
You're lame.
I'm lame.
-That's my car. -Your car?
What happened here?
JERKS
-It's open. -Our stuff is here.
Here's my phone.
Can you read it? I think I see an "E".
Here's the key.
I did my best with what you had in the fridge.
What are we having?
-Penne with vegetables. -I'll have two.
-Two what? -Two pennes.
Just kidding, chef.
Two big servings of solitude.
I have myself,
you have yourself, and we have one another.
Wonderful!
She is really wonderful.
Lina, your Better Half Combo is amazing.
Isn't it? The classic finger food,
also known as street food with frills.
Idealized by our just-divorced Ju,
and developed by our chef Luiz Pereira, who's killing it!
You're on fire.
I'm going to change.
DECEMBER FRI 9 ENGAGEMENT DINNER
WED 14 29TH ANNIVERSARY
TUE 20 ANNUAL PEREIRA FAMILY REUNION
Excuse me. God, my son is here!
-My love. -Mom!
-My babies. -You look stunning!
You look so
full of life.
The doctors are saying
that I'm a curious case, like Benjamin Button.
I keep getting younger. Right, Ed?
I can confirm it's true.
It's really a miracle, isn't it?
I need a drink. Enjoy it.
-Is it nice, my love? -It's wonderful.
Hey.
Listen. Don't you think Valdete's had plastic surgery?
Her eyes look a little slanted.
-What's the big deal? -See? You killed the conversation again.
-You just talk about people's lives. -Your life must be so…
Yes! Good evening, Pereira family!
This is the moment you have all been waiting for.
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.
Our dance contest!
The dance contest!
They've won this contest for the last 21 years.
Let's give it up for Maria Inez and Samir.
The next couple in our contest is Maria Eugênia and Tonico.
We'll nail it today! Valdete and Carlos, come up on stage.
Making their debut in our contest,
let's hear it
for Luiz Pereira and Lina!
Let's give it up for our contestants.
Let's begin!
You can't beat me.
I'm Madonna. You don't have what it takes.
Shut up. I'm a better dancer. Is everyone ready? DJ?
Oh Lord!
My God!
Looks like we have our finalists,
and we're ready for the last song in the contest. Hit it.
That was quite a show!
Let's hear it for our finalists.
I want you to vote for the best couple by a round of applause.
Maria Inez and Samir!
Luiz Pereira and Lina!
We won.
My baby!
Go!
Tonight's champions are Luiz and Lina!
Everybody's looking at us.
Use our secret word.
"Kiss"?
Congratulations, Luiz and Lina.
I have a surprise for the lovebirds.
And for all of you. Our special guest is online.
Suellen Glória.
Luiz's real girlfriend.
Hello, everyone.
I'm at a spiritual retreat
because I was really hurt by what happened.
But I can only heal if I heal you too.
Just get to the point!
The truth is that Luiz and Lina…
just lied…
Lies… to…
-Draw the line… -It's freezing!
The truth is that Luiz and Lina…
That's it, everyone. Namaste.
"Namaste"? You prick!
What's that, Maria Inez?
She can prove that this couple is a fraud.
Maria Inez is right.
I had a relationship with Suellen Glória.
It was a real thing.
And I hired Lina as a fake wife.
I paid her to be my fiancée. My engagement
is a fraud.
But I have to be honest.
We played around with love so much…
that I'm in love.
I told you that he was lying, Mom.
I've known it all along.
What?
Please, don't tell him.
Actually,
I'm the one who's been paying Lina.
That's it.
Perhaps the secret ingredient of the best love stories
is two big servings of solitude.
A woman wants to talk to you.
-A woman? -Yes.
Who?
Your mother-in-law.
I can lend you money. How much?
We make the same wage, and you spend twice as much. What's left to lend?
-Don't you have anything to tell me? -Like what?
You're acting weird.
What?
That's why you did all this for me?
For money?
You're a freaking liar.
I am a liar.
But even though I lied,
I was really confused about this job
and what I was feeling
for you.
Turns out, this was my most difficult job.
To be myself with someone.
Have a nice life.
Here you go. It's all set.
Stay as long as you need. My house is your house.
Thanks, brother. I got some clothes for you.
I'm here for you.
Hey, champ.
No openings.
We should have a kitchen here, man.
It's not that simple, man. It's small, and I have three partners.
Keep looking, you'll find something. Google it.
-Hello. -Hi. How are you?
I'm here about the chef position.
It's been filled. Thank you.
KITCHEN ASSISTANT WANTED
Lina, I have to shut off the lights.
This is what Ms. Carlota is doing to me. My own mother.
Ms. Carlota has overprotected you.
-But she did something right. -What?
-Look at the man you've become. -I guess.
In six months, I've become a homemaker, a chef…
Someone's loved one.
If what I had with Lina were real,
we would be…
In phase three, real love. I know the rules.
I almost fell for the soul mate crap.
We try to find the one,
but we should be looking for someone who brings out who we want to be.
Brother, what's keeping you
from becoming the man you want to be?
Just go for it. It's on you.
Hello.
You talk to plants now? This is the tree of happiness, right? I’m thanking it.
This is the tree of happiness, right? I’m thanking it.
Making wishes.
You're funny.
I…
I told her
to stay here for as long as she needed.
But she decided to leave.
Did you lie about dying? Of course not, Luiz.
Six months ago, my diagnosis said that I wouldn't get this far.
But it turned out
that you left home and,
I don't know, we both went through a healing process.
I seemed to get better after every test.
So, your problem was me.
Perhaps
the secret ingredient of the best love stories
is
two big servings of solitude.
I have myself,
you have yourself,
and we have one another.
No, I'm mad at you. You went too far. No.
Luiz.
Do you have any idea how far I'd go to see you happy?
You have no idea.
Why don't you spend the night with me?
We can watch a movie and have popcorn, just like the old days.
Okay.
Yay!
Popcorn!
-What is she doing here? -I got divorced. I'm living in your room now.
Listen, I won't have you two picking on each other.
You should call a truce.
-Let's watch a movie. -That's better.
…have been blocked
between Pinheiros and Tietê freeways.
The end, that's it.
Cool.
I'll switch to the news. SÃO PAULO IS AT A STANDSTILL
The city literally stopped. If you look over there…
It's just São Paulo being São Paulo! Always chaos.
-The traffic is held up. -It's Lina!
-Look! -My career and my life are held up.
I'm trying to give up on everything, but I can't even do that.
It's unbelievable!
-What are you waiting for? Go find her. -Do something.
-Hurry up. -Just go.
LINA CALLING…
Hi, this is Lina. If I didn't answer, I'm busy. Leave a message.
It's jammed everywhere.
NESTOR VIDEO CALL
Nestor, what's up?
Brother, I just saw Lina on TV.
I'm on my way to find her.
You can't get there by car.
Get a bike. Or run there if you have to.
There's no other way. I'm hanging up.
Can you give me a lift, man? You're a lifesaver.
Listen, I give up.
-What? We're too far. -It's okay, I'll walk.
Brother,
I can't thank you enough. Thanks.
Can you open the trunk, please?
Thanks.
-It's far, I can take you there. -It's fine.
It's all the same around here. Except for our outraged citizen, who's decided to walk.
She'll have to walk 10km to the airport, but she doesn't seem to care.
Lina!
Lina!
Marry me. Have sex with me. Work with me. Do everything with me.
Yes!
What's going on here, everyone?
Are you getting that, Robson?
We're celebrating the union of Luiz Pereira and Maria Abigail Maia.
Maria Abigail?
Lina is my stage name. Another Maria in my life.
-It's my first exclusivity contract. -Okay.
Carlotinha, your heart is racing.
That's because of you, Ed.
Now you'll deal with the three phases of marriage.
Phase one, you're in love.
-It's happiness, right? -No. It's illusion.
-How's that? -Allan Kardec once said that…
-Allan Kardec? Please! -Seriously, you should read it.
My aunt sent it to me.
I'm divorced. I've rebelled against the rules of society.
-Who's the square now? -You, Maria Inez.
Everybody gets divorced. Do you want to go against society?
Just stay married.
-Look what I brought to my sweetie. -You're here!
-Samir. -Yes?
-Why are you here? -No…
She invited me.
We're just hooking up. He's my crush, my date.
After all, I am Maria Inez.
I'm unforgettable.
You let people tell their own story.
I hope it sparks curiosity.
Gosh, this is fun.
[Julia] I want to know...
-You guys could do whatever you want... -[Michelle] Yeah.
...starting a couple years ago, -pretty much. -[Michelle] Mm-hmm.
Why did you decide to do what you're doing? Why did you decide to talk about storytelling?
Well, one way of looking at what we've both been doing for the last...
not just ten years, but the last... 20 years, -maybe most of our career... -Most of our careers
-maybe most of our career... -Most of our careers once we left law, you know.
-Sort of the traditional path. -...was to tell stories.
If you want to be in relationships with people, and connect with them, and...
uh, understand them, and, uh, ultimately,
work together with them...
You have to know their story. You have to know them. You have to-- Yeah. That is...
-exactly what we do. -[Michelle] Yeah.
When we go in to film something,
we don't go in with, like... "This is the story. Let's go get it."
-[Barack] Right. -It's like, "Okay,
-there's something going on here... -[Michelle] Mm-hmm. ...in our community." Like, this big plant is about to close.
...in our community." Like, this big plant is about to close.
Looks bad for our community. Let's just not decide what the story is.
-[Steven] No. -Let's just go in there,
go to the local bar, find people to talk with, sit and listen to them,
go to the local bar, find people to talk with, sit and listen to them, -have a beer with them. -[Barack] Yep.
To me, a good film interview is all about creating a relationship.
Yeah, we all have a sacred story in us, right?
A story that gives us meaning, and purpose, and how we...
-[Julia] Mm-hmm. -...organize our lives.
How did you guys get into storytelling?
We just found in each other, I think, a love of curiosity about people,
wanting to connect, wanting to be in the world,
not wanting to live in, um, a bubble,
but, like, to be out in the real world.
And... a love of filmmaking.
People like the people I grew up with were not really seen in films,
were not really seen in documentaries,
on news. Like, in the Midwest, in the heartland of America,
you didn't hear from those folks.
I'm from a working-class family.
You know, my dad was a union man,
and I knew we didn't have to worry about the bills being paid,
the lights being shut off.
But looking at what I see people around us are now facing,
they don't have that.
And we want to give voice to people who don't appear on-screen.
Working people, their stories, their struggles, their hopes.
That should be on-screen. Those should be out in the world.
-Because they're equally compelling to... -Yeah.
...superheroes.
I mean, those-- those first scenes of, you know,
that... that-that Midwestern weather,
and, you know, opening up and seeing the scenes of those folks
on the floor in their uniforms. I mean,
that was my story. It's my background. -That was my father. -[Julia] Mm-hmm.
What gave him pride and a sense of purpose was that uniform, and that job,
and that ability to pay the bills, and to, you know, send us to college.
And that was reflected in this... this film.
Um, but it also connects to the power of telling those stories
to break down all the things that we think keep us apart.
What we always try to do is see everybody's point of view
and see that everybody has their reasons.
You go to all these different kinds of places.
There's two things that you do.
-One is, you try to be yourself. -[Michelle] Mm-hmm.
-And the other is... -You try to connect.
-...you try to connect. -[Michelle] Mm-hmm.
-You be yourself, and you try to connect. -[Michelle] Yeah.
-And you listen, and you-- -[Michelle] Yeah.
And leave all those preconceived notions of what's the story,
-who to follow. -Be with the person. Be with the person.
And don't go in with an idea of what it's supposed to be about.
Because, really, you're finding that out.
Making people feel
-like being themselves is okay. -[Julia] Yeah.
And if people don't see themselves out there...
And "out there" is the-- is film.
-It is movies. It's TV. -[Julia] Mm-hmm.
[Michelle] And it's important for us, when we have these platforms,
is to do our best to-- to put more stories out there.
If you know someone, if you've talked to them face-to-face, -if you know what their story is... -[Julia] Mm-hmm.
...you can forge a connection. You may not agree with them on everything,
but there's some common ground to be found...
-[Julia] Mm-hmm. -...and you can move forward together.
Part of continuing our project
of trying to make the world a little better for Malia, and Sasha,
-and... your kids, and your grandkids... -[Julia] Our grandkids, yeah.
...uh, was to put some better stories out there...
[Julia] Mm-hmm. ...and make sure that we're hearing each other
because, if we're doing that,
we think that, actually,
uh, people end up, um...
you know, coming up with some better answers. So that was our theory.
[Michelle] And one of the many things I love about this film,
this project that you two did together,
is that you let people tell their own story.
-[Julia] Mm-hmm. -That... That American Factory doesn't come in with a perspective.
-[Julia] Mm-hmm. -It's not an editorial.
I mean, you truly let people speak for themselves.
And that is a powerful thing that you don't always see happen.
One thing we try to do with the film is give everyone their voice.
Even if we disagreed with them,
in the filming and the editing,
we wanted to make sure that, if they saw the movie,
they would say, "Okay, yeah. That is my perspective."
Fair and honest,
even if it may clash with the next person you see.
Our job, to me, when we go into these situations is to, first of all, connect,
when we go into these situations is to, first of all, connect,
be ourselves, make everybody feel comfortable,
and come back, and back, and back.
This is, again, unlike the filmmaker who flies into something,
we live there. We drive over there, 25 minutes from our house.
Uh, we're gonna show up. We're gonna show up again.
We're not just gonna interview you once.
We're not looking for a "gotcha." We've never made a muckraking film.
Nothing like-- We're not interested in that kind of film,
because I think we're driven by such a sort of curiosity about people,
-especially going through hard things. -This is your community.
-These are your neighbors, friends. -Our heart's with them.
It's a leap of faith on... on the part of-of the chairman
and... and his whole team.
What I was struck by was they exhibited a lot more trust
than I would've expected.
Once you get that kind of trust, you don't betray it.
I think one of the things that makes the movie powerful is the fact
that it's not all black-and-white. There's a bunch of gray.
When we approach-- When we started talking about,
"We're gonna make this movie,"
we said clearly, like, we're not gonna make a promo video
-for the factory. -Right.
You've gotta give us real access, but we have to have editorial control.
Now, admittedly, in the early days, it was exciting.
It was, like, these cultures coming together.
And you see that in the film. There's a lot of optimism.
And we were there.
And then, as things got hard, we were still there.
And what we found, over the years making documentaries, is...
people will say, at some point,
"Yeah, it's getting hard, but you're kind of on the inside now,
so you should stay in the room."
And we're lucky that people kept that attitude.
People trust us with their story,
and we try to represent them, and that's a huge responsibility,
but we feel so lucky.
And, with your help, these stories will reach the world.
-We still got a little pull, you know? -[chuckling]
And how are you going to balance documentary and scripted fiction?
You know, I think our theory is: a good story is a good story.
-[Julia] Mm-hmm. -If there's a good story to be told...
-[Julia] Mm-hmm. -If it's a documentary, like yours,
that helps not only to lift up how people are living,
but also captures
the-the... cultural clash,
and grappling with what globalization means in a really intimate way,
or if it's, uh...
a scripted story that...
you know, in some ways, captures, uh, our common humanity
and helps people understand something they didn't understand before,
we want to... we want to see if we can give voice to that.
Between the two of us, we have an eclectic set of tastes.
And Higher Ground is a reflection of both of us,
so that means that, you know,
our-our platform is gonna look a little bit like everything,
just like the world is a little bit of everything. [Julia] Mmm.
So we don't have a particular formula yet.
-[Julia] Right. -It's just, is it good?
-[Barack] Does it move us? -Uh, can it-- Does it move us?
-It has to. -[Michelle] Will it move the viewers
in some way, shape, or form?
We want people to be able to get outside of themselves... [Julia] Yeah.
...and experience and understand the lives of somebody else,
which is what a good story does.
And that's why we're calling it "Higher Ground."
The idea is that, uh...
rather than pursuing the lowest common denominator,
right? Let's see if we can chase the highest one.
Let's see if we can all elevate a little bit
outside of our immediate self-interest,
and our immediate fears, and...
uh, you know, our immediate anxieties,
and kind of take a look around and say,
"Huh! You know, we're... we're part of this... this larger thing."
And-- And if we can do that through some storytelling,
[woman 2] Good day, sir. [man 1] Good day.
[woman 1] Next, please.
Everybody get down!
[man 2, in Afrikaans] Damn.
[in English] Don't be a hero. Stay down! Hey!
[man 2, in Afrikaans] Don't shoot.
-[in English] I said down. -[man 2] Don't shoot.
-[in English] I said down. -[man 2] Don't shoot. Move.
-[man 2 exclaims] -[man 1] Move, move. Down.
Where are you going? Down!
[man 3] Shit!
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a bank robbery.
So you stay calm and you go home.
My name is Calvin Khumalo.
I was born in Mabopane, where running water is a luxury.
My comrades and I grew up in apartheid South Africa,
the most unequal society in the world.
We joined the liberation movement following the June 16 uprisings,
which left many of our peers dead.
With the majority of our leaders either imprisoned or in exile,
the youth have made it their responsibility
to put an end to this unethical system.
The main objective?
Make the country ungovernable.
The white minority regime has left us with only one option.
Violence.
Our orders from high command were simple.
Sabotage strategic key points in the capital,
with no civilian casualties.
That was the plan.
Comrades, Seahorse supplies oil to the South African Defense Force.
We take the oil. You take the supply and power.
[Khumalo] We plant the explosives and hit as many fuel tanks as possible.
[Khumalo] There's no need for me to tell you that if we get caught,
there will be no prison time.
Only the rope.
The truck driver should be here any minute.
We get the signal from him and we move. Fast.
Gents, two minutes.
Terra! Hurry, man!
We don't have much time. I can't hold it, man!
-Terra… -Mbali!
Get back in the car.
[in Zulu] Emergency, gentlemen. Jeez.
-[in English] He's late. -He shouldn't be.
-[in English] He's late. -He shouldn't be. [man 1] Can't we go on foot?
We need the truck driver for gate access.
Are you sure it's the right location? I mean, mistakes happen, huh?
Khumalo doesn't make mistakes.
[man 1] Okay.
These guys have been off the radar for so long,
but instead of fleeing, they come back to the capital,
one of the most protected cities in the whole damn country.
Uh, it makes no sense, man.
Makes perfect sense.
This is the arena. It's the heart of their fight.
[radio] Now, time for the news.
An explosion at the Rooiwal Power Plant near Pretoria early yesterday morning
has left thousands of homes without electricity and caused millions of rands worth of damage.
This is the latest in a series of sabotage acts by the terrorists
that have rocked large cities across South Africa…
Today it stops.
[radio] …causing speculation that a state of emergency might…
[in Zulu] Go! Go MK!
[radio in English] Anyone with information, contact Captain Langerman…
[Terra, in Zulu] Team MK. Go MK!
[radio in English] …in Pretoria on 012-555-2670.
[in Zulu] Where are you going now?
[in English] One's coming out.
Get ready! Get ready!
Move back! He is coming towards you. Move back!
Black woman, smoking in public…
[in Zulu] No way…
[in English] What now!
-[Khumalo] Get back inside. Let's go! -That's our guy!
[Terra] Let's move.
Are we doing this or what?
-That's not him. That's not our driver. -[Terra] What?
-[man 2] Who is he? -I don't know. Something's wrong.
-Something's not right. -I feel it.
I can feel it. Get back inside.
Baker…
[radio in Zulu] Homeless.
[in English] Baker. I think he's gonna bolt.
Abort mission! Abort mission!
-[man 2] Move! -All units move in.
Hey! Come on!
[Langerman] I want them alive! Do not shoot!
Move, go!
-Masego! -[Khumalo] Get the guns!
Move! Move! Move!
-Masego! Masego, move! -[all] Go!
-[Khumalo] Move! Come on, go! -[Terra] Masego!
[Langerman] Everybody go! Go! Go!
-Move. -[Terra] Faster, man.
[Khumalo, in Zulu] This street!
[Terra] It's a gang, man.
[Khumalo, in English] Move.
Masego, can't this thing go faster? Move, man!
[Khumalo, in Zulu] Piss off! I'll kill you!
[driver, in Afrikaans] What now?
[in English] Keep moving.
Get this thing out of here! Come on! Get it out!
[laughs] I think we lost them.
-[in Zulu] Let's go! -[in English] Trying to kill us. Move!
Move!
[Masego] Who's this driver?
Taxi rank!
[in Zulu] You're driving right past it!
Reverse.
[in English] Come on!
[in Zulu] Go in, brother!
[in English] We got set up, man!
-Go, Masego! Let's move. -[Terra, in Zulu] Masego, no way man!
-[in English] Drive, Masego! -[Terra] Go!
[Khumalo] Comrades.
We lost Comrade Masego.
We have to go.
[in Zulu] Comrades, get moving. We need to find a way out.
[Terra] Masego?
[Terra] Masego! Wake up! What do you think you're doing? Masego, don't do this to me!
Masego, I'm begging you.
[in English] Terra, Terra, we need to go.
No. Go, go, go. I'll stay with him. -Terra, we have to leave. -[in Zulu] Go. Quickly, go.
-Terra, we have to leave. -[in Zulu] Go. Quickly, go.
[in English] Terra… Mbali. We need to go. Mbali!
[Terra, in Zulu] Fuck you!
[Khumalo] Terra! We need to move!
[in English] Let's go. Go!
[man, in Afrikaans] I think it's Pieter!
Pieter, are you okay?
-[Langerman, in English] It's clear. -[man] He's still breathing.
[in Afrikaans] Hold on, buddy, hold on.
[in English] Pretoria Post.
It's the same van they used for the Rooiwal job.
[in Afrikaans] Hold on, they are on their way.
[in English] They left one behind.
[man, in Afrikaans] Men, search the building.
[in English] I want this whole building turned upside down! They must be here somewhere, Malan!
[in Afrikaans] Go up there! Every car as well.
[Khumalo, in English] This way!
Dead end!
-[yells] Here, here! -[Khumalo, in Zulu] Let's get out of here!
[in English] Okay.
-[Khumalo] Come on! -[man] Move!
Go!
Move!
[man] Go, go, go!
[Khumalo, in Zulu] Press, Aldo, press!
[Aldo, in English] Make one line!
Go, go.
[officer, in Afrikaans] Get out of the way!
[Khumalo, in English] Move!
-[in Zulu] Let's go, guys! -[Aldo, in English] Go!
[Terra] Khumalo!
[Aldo] Calvin! [gasps] My pump!
-Calvin, can you go on? -[gunfire]
[Terra, in Zulu] Let's go!
[Aldo, in English] Move!
-[gunshots] -[officer] Shots fired!
[Terra] Let's go!
[in Zulu] Go past! Go past!
Keep going! [in English] Move! Let's go!
Ah, shit! I'm out!
-[Terra, in Zulu] This way. -[Khumal, in English] Everybody move!
-Everybody! -[Terra] Let's go!
Move!
[Aldo] Calvin! Calvin!
Calvin!
[Khumalo] Aldo!
[Khumalo] Move!
[Khumalo] Come on, Aldo.
[Khumalo] That's it.
[in Zulu] Rabbi, get down! Down!
[Aldo] Move, clear!
-[in English] Move. -Move! Move!
[Khumalo] Everybody down!
Move! Let's go!
[Khumalo, in Zulu] Go past!
[in English] Everybody down!
Everybody down!
Go!
[Khumalo] Go back! Go back!
[Terra, in Zulu] What kind of shit is this?
[in English] We're trapped!
Oh my God!
[Khumalo] Move!
[in Zulu] Hurry, Ma. Go!
[in English] Move!
Hold your fire. I repeat, hold your fire!
Secure.
[woman] Next, please.
It's a bank.
[in Zulu] Gents, what are we going to do?
-[in English] This is bad. -Calm down.
Terra, your side. Move.
Aldo, your side.
-[man pops tongue] -Could you stop that? It's rather disgusting.
Well, hello to you too, beautiful.
By the way, you are definitely in the wrong line.
No, actually…
I'm in the right line. Name's Washington, Cornelius Washington.
Now that's cold.
[in Afrikaans] What you think you're doing, boy? [in English] Excuse me? Um, who you calling a boy?
Don't play dumb with me. You're in the wrong line.
Whites only. Blacks that side. Get your hands off me. I'm an American.
Is it? Well, you're in Africa now, boy!
He's the American citizen that phoned in yesterday.
Damn Skippy. What? A man can't breathe?
[in Afrikaans] You didn't say he's Black. [in English] Did I have to?
[in Afrikaans] Johan, let him go. Johan.
Don't even worry about it.
I'm from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Hmm.
I deal with dumbass rednecks all the time.
Thanks for understanding.
All right, everybody, listen up.
This is now a hostage situation.
Nobody goes in this bank, nobody goes out.
We need a command post over there. Schoeman, set up phone lines.
Good day, sir. Good day.
[woman] Next, please.
Captain, they're already shooting at the hostages.
No, not yet. It's too soon.
Get me a bullhorn. [Khumalo] Everybody down!
Don't play a hero. [Aldo] Move!
[Khumalo] Stay down!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come here.
-Down! -[Johan] Don't shoot.
[Khumalo] Down, down, down!
Where are you going?
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is not a bank robbery.
So you stay calm and you go home.
Stay calm, go home.
[in Zulu] Hold fast!
[Terra, Aldo] Hold fast!
-[Aldo, in English] Move! -Okay, okay.
Hey, give.
Okay. Please don't shoot me. I have a two-year-old daughter.
And if you want to see her again, don't try any tricks.
-Okay. Sorry. -[Aldo] Move.
-Get up! -[hostages cry out]
Um… Please don't hurt me.
Money's in the vault. Just don't hurt anyone.
Take the money. Just don't hurt anyone.
Move.
-Okay. -[Khumalo] Now.
Hurry.
[woman] I could show you where the vault is.
This isn't a bank robbery.
Then what is it?
What's your name?
Christine. I'm the supervisor.
Christine the supervisor.
Is there a back way out? No, only the front.
Move.
-Move! -[nervously] Okay. Okay, okay.
[Aldo] Get up!
[Khumalo] On the floor.
Not there, in there! Move. [Aldo] Sit.
[Khumalo, in Zulu] What's this? Hello.
Looks like this one has issues.
[in English] That means you too.
-It's filthy. -[Terra mocks]
[in Sotho] Sit down!
Don't get on my nerves.
[in English] Move! Move, let's go.
[in Zulu] Ladies too. [in English] Let's go!
[Schoeman] Captain.
Captain. I think we might have something.
Yeah?
I'm not moving. I'm not going anywhere. Whatever…
-[Langerman] Who's she? -[Schoeman] Name's Jane.
She claims to be related to the bank supervisor.
A woman, white, by the name of Christine. She says she can help.
A woman, white, by the name of Christine. She says she can help. -What do you think? -I'm not moving…
Let's keep her close. We might need her later.
I can't go out like this. Khensani's pregnant.
[in Zulu] I know.
[in English] Just get your mind off it.
Erasmus…
we've been betrayed.
Khumalo has a lot of explaining to do.
I don't know. Not Calvin.
[Terra] Then who?
[Aldo] Someone in high command sold us out.
I want answers.
And I want them now.
[man] Shit! If anyone comes near those windows,
shoot them all!
Calvin Khumalo, Aldo Erasmus, Mbali Terra Mabunda.
We have the entire building surrounded. [in Zulu] How's he know our names?
Never mind our names. How did he know about the mission?
[in English] Surrender your weapons and come out with your hands above your head.
-[in Zulu] Maybe the truck driver? -No. All the truck driver knew
was to meet us there and drive us in. That's it.
This guy knew everything.
[in English] Someone had to have told him.
[Langerman] I repeat, Calvin, we have the building surrounded.
[in Zulu] Don't look at me.
I lost Masego today. Don't piss me off.
There were other units on the Seahorse mission.
[Langerman, in English] Come out with your hands above your head.
What are we gonna do?
Get out.
[Langerman] Calvin Khumalo?
[in Afrikaans] I'm Captain Langerman. South African Police.
We met outside the bank.
[in English] English. How do you know our names?
We've been tracking you for months.
We know you were behind the Rooiwal job.
You don't speak Afrikaans, yet you call yourself a South African?
Do you speak Zulu?
[Langerman] No. Your people have been here 400 years
and you haven't bothered to learn an indigenous language,
yet you call yourself a South African?
Let's not get off on the wrong foot. Okay?
[Khumalo] Too late for that, Captain.
You've got to understand,
this is Pretoria.
By taking over this square
and this bank,
you're spitting in the face of the Afrikaner nation.
I don't give a damn about the Afrikaner nation.
They've taken apart my family, and they've taken apart many more.
My point is that it is going to be up to you and me to resolve this.
Peacefully and quickly.
Otherwise, it's going to end badly.
For everyone.
[Khumalo] Listen here… This is what's going to happen.
Me and my comrades are going to walk out of here safely.
Unless you want us to start throwing bodies out the door.
[repeats] No.
Nobody needs to get hurt, Calvin. I'll get you what you want.
I want a helicopter.
I want an unarmed pilot.
And I want safe passage to a location of our choosing,
which I will tell the pilot once we're airborne, no tricks.
Do you understand me? Fine.
[Khumalo] Captain, we have an American citizen in here.
He'll be traveling with us.
You have 20 minutes.
Get ready to move out.
Captain!
[Langerman] No. Not now. Not now.
[reporter] Captain.
You think this will work? This is perfect.
With all due respect, Captain…
this could get messy very quickly.
But better it gets messy out here than in the bank.
Get me the helicopter. Let's get them outside.
Hey, brother.
You okay?
We're getting out of here.
Soon. You are going back to Khensani.
Do you really believe that?
[Khumalo] After this, you'll be holding your newborn baby in your arms.
[Khumalo] Come on, Aldo.
I know today has been a rough day.
I know we lost Masego. But…
we've been through far worse situations.
And… -And Terra hasn't killed anyone yet. So… -[Aldo laughs]
we're going to be okay.
Let's go home, okay?
Let's go home. Let's go.
Ladies and gentlemen.
We would like to thank you for your kind cooperation.
And give our sincere apologies
for any inconvenience caused.
We did not intend to be here. But here we are.
Unfortunately, for me and my comrades to depart,
we are going to need
a volunteer.
Man, I'm Black, just like you. I ain't got nothing to do with this.
Oh.
So now you're Black.
You do make a valid point.
You are Black.
Just like me.
You. You'll be our American.
[Langerman] Targets are exiting the bank.
Nice and easy.
They're heading towards the helicopter.
Terra.
-How long you been in the police force? -I'm not.
This is a '64 Alouette, French-made,
used in the Matola Raid. You know your stuff.
Matola Raid.
So don't try any tricks. Move.
[in Zulu] Let's go.
[in English] Targets are now entering the helicopter.
Copied, Captain. We're clear. We are clear.
Let's move it.
[Terra] Okay, let's go.
Something's wrong.
[Khumalo] Aldo, move in!
Calvin I… I don't…
[Khumalo] What are you doing?
Schoeman, what do you hear? [Terra] Aldo, let's go!
Aldo, man. You have to trust me. Come, let's move!
-This is too easy. -Move.
Calvin!
[in Afrikaans] Shoot!
[in English] Hostage breaking away. Do not fire. I repeat, do not fire.
[in English] Hostage breaking away. Do not fire. I repeat, do not fire. [Aldo, in English] Get up!
[Johan, in Afrikaans] Shoot! -[Langerman] Do not fire. -[Terra] Get up!
[Khumalo, in Zulu] Come out of there, you dog. Come out!
Come on, dog. Move.
[in English] Back to the bank!
Everybody move!
The hostage in the white shirt is not American. He's a Boer.
-[Johan, in Afrikaans] Shoot! -[Langerman, in English] Do not fire.
[Khumalo] You messed up, Captain! I see you, you messed up!
-[Langerman] What happened? -[Khumalo] You know!
Damn it!
[in Zulu] Move. Move, dog.
[in English] Move.
-[Khumalo] Move. -[Terra] Get back!
[Khumalo] Move.
[Terra, in Zulu] Sit down!
[Aldo, in English] Go.
You are alone now. Do you hear me? -You are alone now. -[moaning] No.
-[Schoeman] No! -Schoeman?
We've lost the signal.
[in Afrikaans] We've lost the signal.
[in English] Huh? Triple seven. A Black white supremacist.
It's not what you think. [in Zulu] You're a piece of crap.
[in English] Move! On the floor.
On the floor!
[Aldo] I knew they weren't gonna let us fly away.
Calvin. I'm… I'm sorry.
I should have listened.
You're sorry? You're sorry?
I'll show you sorry, son of a bitch. I should have just killed you myself.
What about Masego?
-You selfish piece of shit! -Go to hell, Terra!
[Terra] You'll go to hell! I'll show you hell.
[Terra] You'll go to hell! I'll show you hell. Enough!
Terra, please. I understand, okay?
[in Zulu] He nearly had us killed.
[in English] We'd be dead if it wasn't for him, okay?
[in Pidgin] Please…
[in English] I'm bleeding here.
[in Zulu] Come here.
[in English] Get up!
[Khumalo] Terra!
[in Zulu] And now?
[Terra] Get in…
Let's go. [in English] Move!
-[pilot, in English] Okay. -[Terra, in Zulu] Let's go.
[in English] Big men with guns, huh?
But you're nothing but a bunch of terrorists.
[in Zulu] Get up.
[in English] Busy working for the white man? Get up, boy!
Who's the bloody informer?
On your bloody knees. On your bloody knees. Shit!
-Who is the bloody informer? -[pilot] I don't--
-[pilot gasping] -[in Zulu] Talk!
-I don't know. -[Terra] Lies!
[in English] Shit!
[in English] I don't know. I'm just a pilot.
Terra.
Because of people like him, Masego is dead.
Terra…
[in Zulu] Go cool off.
[in English] The police knew about the Seahorse Oil mission
because somebody told them.
See, the way I see it, you have two options.
Tell me nothing and die in this bank, or…
you tell me who the informant is
and you'll live.
I don't know.
I wasn't part of the operation.
Then why were you armed?
They put the gun in the helicopter so I could take you out
once you told us your location.
They would be waiting for you there…
in an ambush.
Brigadier's orders.
You have to realize one thing.
There's only one of two ways you're leaving this bank.
Prison
or death.
They found the wiretap.
Just when you think your day couldn't get any worse.
[Schoeman] Yeah.
[in Afrikaans] The Little Crocodile is here.
The Little Crocodile is here.
[in Afrikaans] Captain Langerman. Brigadier.
The Big Crocodile is dying to see you. And he's on the warpath.
-Brigadier, we've been on this case-- -[Brigadier] I'm not talking to you.
What's that?
[Schoeman] It's a helicopter, Brigadier.
I know what it is, Schoeman.
But why is it standing there? In front of Uncle Paul?
Fix it.
Oh, and…
Have you seen the bank manifest?
The Justice Minister's daughter, Christine, is one of the hostages.
Really, sir?
Yes, Schoeman. Really.
Yes, Schoeman. Really. That's why I'm here.
With all the horses, the dogs, the guns, the soldiers, and everything.
This crap stops now.
Do you understand me, Captain?
[Khumalo, in English] What's in that case?
What do you think?
Wait, hang on, man. Why don't you say we make a deal, huh?
You want money? All right.
Here you go.
Look, I don't want your money, okay?
Come on, man. Who doesn't want money, huh? I'm a boxing promoter.
I'm a boxing promoter. You know that big fight with John Tate and Gerrie Coetzee, huh?
Well, how about Nelson Mandela? You know Mandela, right?
He's a boxer.
Just let me go.
That's it.
It is?
-Hey! -[Cornelius] Whoa, easy.
[Terra] What is it?
I have a plan. Hey, so we have a deal or what?
[Aldo] Just sit down!
Excuse me. When do we get to leave?
These people need food and water
and they need to relieve themselves, please.
[in Zulu] What's the plan?
-[in English] They're won't let us out. -I'm not surrendering.
[Khumalo] That's not what I'm saying.
Think about it.
They've been trying to kill us since the depot.
I know I've never let you guys down before, but…
but today, I have.
This could be our last mission.
But…
if our lives are worth nothing, then maybe…
Maybe we negotiate for a life that is worth everything.
Calvin.
Calvin!
Calvin!
This is the prime minister. He doesn't negotiate.
And we've tried this already.
[Terra, in Zulu] Khumalo. You're starting again. [in English] Yes, we did.
For us. Okay?
But what if we turn this into a movement?
A movement? We need permission from high command.
In here we are high command.
No surrender.
No retreat.
[Langerman] Calvin?
I told you if you didn't comply with my demands, there would be consequences.
What are you talking about? I complied, I delivered your helicopter.
Helicopter? Helicopter?
Hey, that wasn't a helicopter, that was a setup.
I don't want your helicopter, Captain.
How do you expect to get out of here?
You know what?
I don't. Then what do you want?
Meet me at the door.
You've got to talk to me.
Tell me what it is you want.
[Khumalo] Freedom.
We want the immediate release of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela.
-[dramatic sting] -[Khumalo] All charges dropped.
We want a presidential pardon from the prime minister,
and we want it in writing, Captain.
[Langerman] Mandela?
You have one hour to get me a signed copy of that presidential pardon.
Then an hour after that, we want him released in full public view.
Then me and my comrades will surrender.
Calvin, that's a tall order.
A tall order?
Maybe you don't understand it.
Captain, what's the price of freedom?
[Langerman] I don't know.
[Khumalo] Everything.
One hour, Captain.
You think he'll do it?
[Khumalo, in Zulu] Let's not give them any other way.
[in English] This is gonna need some serious motivation.
NOW MORE THAN 1000 000 000 STRONGER.
Then let's give it to them.
[man, in Sotho] Dear Lord
We pray to you…
[in English] …to keep all of us, no matter what side, safe
and grant us safe passage out the bank.
So that Ernie can celebrate his daughter Karmen's second birthday.
We also pray for Amanda and her unborn child, Simon.
For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory. Amen.
For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory. Amen. Amen.
[all] Amen.
[in Afrikaans] Thank you.
They want the release of Nelson Mandela.
In exchange, they'll release the hostages
and surrender.
Hey, what's wrong?
[whispers] Can't breathe.
Okay. Come on, Calvin. Here we go.
There we go.
It's gonna be okay?
I'm fine.
It's fine, let's move.
[in Sotho] My love.
[Christine, in English] Terra.
Your name is Terra, right?
What do you want?
Please, we have a pregnant woman here.
This is inhumane. You can't just keep us here all day.
What is wrong with you?
Do something about it.
Sit down.
Or else what?
[Terra, in Zulu] Didn't get that.
[in English] Were you saying something?
You darkies are all the same.
Nothing but criminals.
Johan.
Get up.
Get up.
Let me hear you say "darkie" one more time.
Say "darkie" one more time. He didn't mean it.
Next time…
shut your mouth, okay?
[muffled] Okay.
Okay, look.
We are thirsty and we are starving.
And I have a flight to catch. Ladies…
[in Zulu] Calm down, please.
[in English] We are working on it. Okay?
Okay.
[in Afrikaans] Dammit.
-[telephone ringing] -[in English] Go.
I hope you're calling me to tell me you have my letter.
Calvin, you know we're considering everything, but these things take time.
The release of a man like Mandela isn't done at the snap of a finger.
Not good enough.
Hello?
Calvin!
[Aldo] What the hell are you doing?
[in Zulu] Khumalo, what are you doing?
Khumalo! Talk to me.
[Khumalo, in English] Get up.
[Cornelius] For what?
[Khumalo] Get up.
[Terra] Get up. Man, I ain't come here for this.
This is bull, that's what it is.
Let's move.
-Man… -[Khumalo] Take this trolley.
-[Terra] Move. -Go.
[Khumalo, in Zulu] Aldo, machine gun.
[in English] Keep an eye on them.
[SWAT leader] Brigadier, they're coming out. The door's opening.
[Brigadier, in Afrikaans] Get ready.
[in English] Hold your fire. Hold your fire.
[in English] Hold your fire. Hold your fire. They're coming outside. This is progress.
Who's he?
-[Brigadier, in Afrikaans] Take them now. -No, wait, Brigadier,
-[Brigadier, in Afrikaans] Take them now. -No, wait, Brigadier, something's not right.
There they are, standing outside.
Shoot them.
[Langerman] No, one of those three isn't one of our suspects.
I didn't say he's one of our suspects. I gave you an order.
Shoot the bastards now. Calvin is cunning as a jackal.
[in English] Take it!
[in Afrikaans] He wouldn't just expose himself like that. I think that man might be a hostage.
[in English] Now pour it.
[in Afrikaans] Now you listen to me, Captain. I gave you an order.
[in English] Brigadier, permission to engage? We have a clear shot.
Nobody fires unless I say so.
-Langerman… -[Langerman] Let me talk to him.
[Brigadier] Langerman!
Pour it!
What is this?
You're out of time, Captain.
Hurry. Now light it!
Light it!
Why are you doing this?
-What does it prove? -Light it.
Wait. Mr. Officer, hold on now. I think there's a big misunderstanding.
-Hold on. Look-- -Light it!
I don't want no trouble. This has nothing to do with me.
-I ain't even from here. -You're home now, brother.
-I ain't even from here. -You're home now, brother. Don't shoot. It's the American.
That's right. I'm an American. I'm a boxing promoter.
I shouldn't even be here. Please, take me with you.
[Terra] Shut up! Listen to me.
I'm not gonna ask you again. Now light it!
Please. Light it.
[SWAT leader] Permission to shoot?
Free Nelson Mandela!
-Brigadier, I got the shot. -No!
Free Nelson Mandela!
[officer] Take him!
[Langerman] Nobody is shooting anything. We're still negotiating.
[Khumalo] Free Nelson Mandela! They must free him.
-[crowd] Free Nelson Mandela, free him! -[Khumalo] Free Nelson Mandela!
[Khumalo] Free Nelson Mandela!
Free him! Free Mandela!
Back in! Move!
Calvin, release some of the hostages.
Will be a sign of good faith.
Maybe you don't understand what I'm talking about.
The next thing I wanna hear from you is that you received that pardon.
If you don't, I'm burning more money and more money.
And when the money's out… [laughs]
Well, then… you know what happens.
Free Nelson Mandela. Free him!
[all in Zulu] Power to the people! Power to the people!
[in Afrikaans] You nearly caused an international incident.
That was an American hostage.
But he's Black!
I couldn't care less that he's American.
Shut them up!
Get rid of this damn disturbance. I do not want to hear them!
[crowd cheers in Zulu] Power to the people!
That was not cool, man.
I know y'all want freedom, but freedom ain't free.
And I ain't gonna be the one to pay for it.
Then who must?
Who must?
Maybe you don't understand.
As long as one of us is in chains, none of us are free.
Save it, man.
[in Zulu] That bloody captain is a piece of shit.
I swear…
[in English] I don't care what Khumalo says, if I get a chance to avenge Masego,
I'm going to do it.
Captain Langerman will get what he deserves. I guarantee it.
[pilot in Afrikaans] Excuse me.
[in English] I'm bleeding. I need the bathroom, please.
[in Zulu] Erasmus, please deal with this dog before I kill him.
-[in English] Get up. -[Christine] What happened?
I almost got shot. That's what happened.
They were talking about freeing Mandela.
-And they made me burn the money. -What?
I'm gonna go talk to him.
[in Afrikaans] Christine, you mad? What do you think you're doing?
[in English] You're not in this alone, Miss Fancy Pants. Coming with you.
-We need to talk to you. -About what?
We've asked for food and water. We haven't received any.
[Khumalo] It's on the way.
You know, from the moment you walked into this bank,
you messed up everyone's life, including your own.
I messed up everyone's life? Me?
I'm not the reason you're standing in a line you shouldn't be.
-Doesn't matter what line I stand in. -[Khumalo] It shouldn't.
But we live in a country where it does for people like us.
[scoffs] That's where you're wrong.
Me, you…
we're not the same.
I think we're more alike than you'd like to admit.
I know your type.
You think you're special, different from the rest.
But truly, you're not.
Does that remind you of anyone?
Maybe you're right. But that still doesn't change the fact
that what you're trying to do here is impossible.
You know, a man once said,
"It always seems impossible until it's done."
That's a wise man and those are beautiful words.
But what's your plan? This is the plan!
To burn money?
How are you gonna get out of here?
The police consider Mandela to be the highest form of terrorist.
Burn all the money you want, they won't release him.
I don't have to explain myself to any of you.
Now go sit down, now!
Go!
And that wise man, that wise man who said that,
that's Nelson Mandela.
That's the man we're trying to free.
Go sit down.
[pilot] You know, it's only a matter of time before the police come in here.
When they do, they'll kill you and everyone else in here.
I don't wanna be caught in the crossfire. [Aldo] Hey, tell someone who gives a shit, okay?
You ought to give a shit.
I ought to kill you myself if we don't start moving. [in Zulu] Let's go.
[in English] The minute you start releasing hostages…
I want to be the first on that list.
And why would I do that?
Because if you don't, Aldo,
I'll tell your friends who the real informant is.
Don't forget about our agreement. Remember, we know where your wife is.
[Aldo] You know what?
You're right. Keep your friends…
close.
No one threatens my family.
Aldo!
Aldo.
Aldo, what happened? He tried to kill me.
Okay, Aldo.
Up, Aldo. Aldo, up.
No one can find out about this.
If they do, they'll storm this bank. Let's grab him.
[Khumalo] Get his legs.
You've got blood on your hands, Comrade.
Clean it off.
Hey, we want food and water.
I can do that for you, but I need a favor in return.
Two hostages.
Four.
[Khumalo] Two.
Okay.
But I need one of them to be Christine.
Why? What's so special about her?
[Langerman] Nothing special.
The bank just wants their female supervisor out of there safely.
[whispers] Standard procedure. Standard procedure.
Just bring that food and water.
[Khumalo] Food and water has arrived.
We're letting you go first. [Aldo] Get up.
You're doing a good thing, son.
So, the police asked me to release you specifically, Christine. Do you know why?
I have no idea.
Okay, well, you are free to go. I'm not walking out those doors.
[in Afrikaans] What are you doing?
[in English] If she doesn't want to go, I'll take her place. Pass me my bag.
Sit down!
Christine, I suggest you go before I change my mind.
I'm not going to leave these people here.
They're my responsibility. I can't just abandon them.
You can take Susan in my place.
Come help me get the food.
Come out.
[in Afrikaans] See you later.
[Langerman, in English] Where's Christine? -[in Afrikaans] Doesn't wanna come out. -[in English] Why not?
-[in Afrikaans] Doesn't wanna come out. -[in English] Why not?
How am I supposed to know? Maybe she likes the ambiance in there.
I gave you two hostages, okay. We need that letter, Captain.
Move it. Hey!
[Schoeman] Where's Christine?
[Langerman] She won't come out of the bank.
[Khumalo] Damn.
Captain. What if we use that old lady over there?
[in Afrikaans] No.
How do you mean "No," Brigadier?
Because I say no.
We could use her to persuade Christine to come out of the bank.
Let me explain something to you both.
You want us to turn a maid
into a heroine on national television?
How desperate do you want us to look? Hmm?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Captain!
If your plan doesn't work, mine will.
[Aldo in English] Come! Bathroom break is over.
Uh, my… my shoelaces.
Hey.
-Hurry up. Don't have all day. -[Khumalo coughing]
-[Johan] Drop it! -Hey!
-Drop your guns! -Put it down.
I said drop the guns!
-Or else I'll kill him. I'll kill him. -Calm down.
I will! Drop it!
-[all shouting] -Put it down.
I will kill him!
-[all shouting] -Look! Look at me! I'm moving back.
I'm moving back. I'm putting it down.
-I will kill him! -Okay! Okay! Okay!
-[indistinct shouting] -Okay! Okay!
All right, I'm dropping it.
[Brigadier, in Afrikaans] Shots. Go!
[in English] Terra, wait. It's a five shooter. You're out.
[in Zulu] Khumalo, shoot him, man!
[in English] The enemy's outside, not in here. No civilian casualties.
But if any of you guys try that again, there will be consequences.
Do you understand me? I told you, you stay calm, you go home.
This is not calm.
Terra, check on Aldo.
-Ernie. -[Ernie] Yeah.
[Khumalo] Come here.
Ernie, you just got a promotion. Go lock up your boss.
-Okay. -Chain him there. [in Zulu] Get up, dog.
[in English] Stay calm!
On the floor.
[in Zulu] Terra, let me have a look…
I'm all right.
[in English] Excuse me.
What? Is there any way we can help?
-I don't know. Do what you can. -[telephone ringing]
Calvin, we heard gunshots. What is happening in there?
[Khumalo] Nobody is hurt yet, Captain.
But that could all change.
You've run out of time.
Thirty minutes, I just need 30 more minutes.
You don't have 30 minutes.
You have 15 minutes.
Fifteen.
Fifteen.
[in Afrikaans] Not now, man.
[Khumalo, in English] Why didn't you leave?
You had every opportunity to go, but you didn't take it.
I'm just trying to help.
Sure, you are.
I'm sure.
Where is she?
[Khumalo] Step away from the door.
There's no way out.
This has nothing to do with me. So I demand to leave right now.
[Khumalo] You don't get to make demands.
What's stopping me from killing you right now?
What?
Like you did the pilot in the vault? Go ahead. Shoot me.
-Probably had white parents. -[exhales]
White friends, spoke English your whole life.
How do you even begin-- It doesn't matter.
My point is,
you can hide behind your history.
Maybe get away with it because of how you look.
Use your privilege…
and your money to keep up the façade.
But you can't run away from who you really are.
-You don't know me! -[dramatic sting]
You think it's easy being me, looking the way that I do?
People constantly sniggering and debating who I am.
You don't know me.
And you know nothing about the choices I've had to make.
Calvin.
You're right.
I don't know you.
The pilot was self-defense.
But if the police find out…
they'll storm the bank.
[Khumalo] Go join the others.
You know, all day I've been thinking who the informant could be.
And I just thought maybe Masego.
This makes me think… maybe Terra.
No…
Not Terra.
She's got a heart of gold.
Masego…
Let's move.
I'll do it.
Uh, Pastor Whatchamacallit…
No offense, but this ain't for you.
I beg to differ. I want to help too, if you'd allow.
You can put the gun to my head if that'll help.
That doesn't seem necessary.
Do as I say and you'll be safe.
Why are you doing this again, Calvin?
Why? Why?!
What you've asked for is not easy to deliver.
-And you know it. -Maybe you don't understand!
-And you know it. -Maybe you don't understand! You have run out of time, Captain.
What's it gonna take? Huh? You know what? I think I'm done burning money.
Maybe I should burn this building, this square,
or maybe Uncle Paul over there!
I will burn this whole country down if it takes it.
You will release him!
Why don't you give them what they want? Let sanity prevail!
[in Afrikaans] Pastor. [in English] I'm doing my best.
Try harder!
In order for this to work, I need Calvin to help me.
You are not a partner. You're not helping me.
You're gonna get someone killed.
Try harder and deliver on your promises.
Deliver!
-Ha! -[Schoeman] Captain! -Letter from the prime minister. -Calvin, wait!
-Wait! -[Schoeman] Captain!
Assuring the release of Mandela.
Calvin, wait. It's your letter.
It's a pardon and a statement of release.
Signed by the prime minister.
I'm gonna bring it to you.
They're going to do it, Calvin.
They're going to release Mandela.
This… This is just a letter.
Okay, well… when are you actually releasing him?
Few hours, I'm sure.
Calvin, wait. Wait. Listen to me.
In order for this to work,
I need to come inside and make sure that all hostages are okay.
-[scoffs] -Then they'll release him.
Please. That's how this works.
Okay, you decide.
Aldo!
Stay back, hey!
Just so you know, Captain. This?
Just so you know, Captain. This? This is just a letter.
You deliver.
You deliver! Deliver!
[in Zulu] Dog. Ha!
[Terra] Khumalo, what does he want in here?
[in English] We're gonna release Mandela, Terra. It's okay.
You get my name out of your mouth. Hear me?
[in Zulu] Don't stress, Terra.
[in English] Hello.
I'm with the police force.
I've been asked to make sure everybody's okay.
We're working to get you out of here, okay?
Christine.
[in Afrikaans] People outside are worried about you.
Come with me, please.
No.
[in English] Okay.
Calvin, please. I need to take the girl.
It seems she feels safer in here than out there, Captain.
And I think you've seen everything you need to see.
Leave.
Wait.
Where is he?
Where's who?
The pilot, Sechaba Maselemola, where is he?
Know what, Captain? I think you've overstayed your welcome.
Leave now.
Wait.
Put your leg on the table.
[in Zulu] Terra, what are you doing?
[in English] The other one.
It's not what it looks like.
Khumalo, you see. He can't be trusted.
Get down.
[shouts] Get down on your knees.
So many lies.
Is anything you say true? Does this check out?
-[Langerman] Yes. -[Khumalo] Does it?
Calvin, I am not lying to you.
-[Khumalo] For your sake! It better. -Please. Please.
Lower your weapons.
Calvin, no one needs to get hurt, please.
Okay, he's right. Okay, okay.
Let's all calm down. Okay?
Calm down. I'll put my gun down. Aldo, you… you put your gun down.
Aldo, you… you put your gun down. Then, Terra? You put your gun down. Okay?
Terra.
Terra, I need you to put your gun down.
Terra.
Mbali!
Okay.
Captain.
I think you should leave now. Right now, go.
Captain Langerman.
That's your name, right?
[Langerman] Why?
[Terra] Your name is Langerman? Yes or no?
Yes, so?
So…
So…
Terra, how do you know his name?
I never told any of you his name, so how do you know it?
I don't.
But Aldo does.
He mentioned Langerman's name when none of us knew it.
Right, Aldo?
Captain Langerman will get what he deserves.
I guarantee it.
Right, Aldo?
Aldo, is this true?
[voice breaks] Is it true, Aldo? Did you…
They got to Khensani.
Terra, I'm sorry.
[Khumalo] Aldo!
Aldo!
No, Aldo…
Terra, what did you do?
They lied to you.
[in Zulu] I should shoot you in the head.
[in English] You lied to him.
And freeing Mandela?
This…
It's a lie too.
Just leave, okay, leave.
Leave now!
Get up.
Move.
Move!
[Khumalo] I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Aldo.
I'm sorry.
Why didn't you tell us?
Why didn't you tell us?
[Brigadier in Afrikaans] I agree, Honorable Minister.
Yes.
Naturally. I will make absolutely sure of it.
Thank you, Honorable Minister.
Langerman, Schoeman.
Get ready to breach.
What? What about the hostages?
-No longer important. -[Langerman] Brigadier…
One of them just died. They're vulnerable.
They could surrender, Brigadier.
[Langerman] We can find a peaceful solution.
You think that after what happened in there that you can convince him?
When I was in the bank
I saw a man who wasn't prepared to pull the trigger.
He could have kept me hostage but he didn't. Why?
I think this whole situation, the violence, the murder
it's consuming him.
You want me to believe that damn terrorist in there
is a good man?
No.
What I'm saying
is that Calvin Khumalo
is fighting for justice.
And he doesn't want to lose more people.
And that's
your problem.
You think that trash in there
are people.
Out!
[Christine in English] I have an idea…
What do you want? I don't have anything for you.
I have police outside. I've got hostages in there.
So what do you want?
I just want a moment alone.
When I was eight my mother died.
And a month or so after her death, Jane came into my life.
Who's Jane? Who the hell's Jane? I don't… Can you leave?
Please just leave!
She was my nanny, but so much more than that.
Listen to me.
Okay, she taught me about love for all and equality.
She said that ubuntu is our duty. What do your people know about ubuntu?
What do you know about humanity?
[in Zulu] We are only human through other human beings.
We are only human through other human beings.
[in English] They're just words, Christine.
The Minister of Justice.
He… He's my--
He's your father.
That's why they wanted you out. [laughs]
I once witnessed my father take another man's life.
Killed him like it was nothing.
And for what?
Because he was Black? So what?
So what, Christine? Huh?
He got killed because he was Black. We get killed because we are Black.
We're kept poor because we are Black. Because I'm Black I'm here.
So what?
There's no pain in your privilege.
My father and the people who work for him,
they represent everything that I don't want to become.
And that's why I'm going to help you.
How?
[Langerman] What's going on, Calvin?
What is this all about?
She has something to say. So listen.
Captain, these men are not criminals.
They didn't come here for the money.
They came to send a message. That all they want is freedom.
What's wrong with that?
[in Afrikaans] Think of your family.
Of your father. Please.
Father.
Please, Father, I implore you.
I know you can see me. Do what they ask. Please.
Do the right thing. [Jane] Christina!
No! What are you doing? Don't touch me, you fool.
Free him!
-[Khumalo] Free him! -[Christine] Free Mandela! Free him!
Free Nelson Mandela!
Cease fire.
[in Afrikaans] Officers, come and fetch this woman.
[Langerman, in English] Cease fire!
Where did that shot come from?
Go! Find him.
[Jane screams] No!
[Brigadier in Afrikaans] Stand down.
Stand down.
-[Khumalo, in English] Christine. -[hostage sobbing]
[Khumalo] Get me some towels. Please, hurry.
It's okay. Hey!
-You were brave, okay? -[gurgles]
Come on, Christine. Christine.
-She's gonna be okay. -[shushes]
[Ernie sobs] Come on, Christine. Come on.
It's okay. [Khumalo] It's okay, Ernie.
It's okay, Ernie.
Captain. The sniper.
Who told you to fire?
I thought I saw a threat.
A threat? A white woman, a threat?
You shot the Minister of Justice's daughter in public.
This is going to cost you your career.
[in Afrikaans] It's a matter of national security.
Come with me.
[in N. Sotho] I'm tired.
I know.
I know, I know.
[in Afrikaans] Don't let them worry you.
You did the right thing.
We'll look after you, soldier. [sniper, in English] Thank you.
[in Afrikaans] Dismissed.
[in English] That's the only picture that I've ever kept.
Our home was a safe house in Mabopane.
I grew up seeing strangers walking in and out of my house
disguised in makeup. Police raids…
And when I was a little boy,
I watched the police
gun down my parents.
I watched my parents on their knees
begging for their lives.
[sighs] I made a promise to myself.
That I wouldn't stop until I avenged them.
And that choice…
That choice brought me to the MK.
To the liberation movement.
It brought me here.
So, I actually lived in Mamelodi with my mother.
She was doing pretty well for herself until she had me.
Then everything changed.
Kids never wanted to play with me.
Their parents demonized me.
They never accepted me.
So…
she gave me up for adoption to her employers.
The Page family.
They loved me.
They cared for me.
But they never understood me.
They never understood my Blackness.
Nobody ever has.
[in Zulu] Khumalo, you have a phone call.
[Langerman, in English] Calvin, are you there? Yes.
[Langerman] The brigadier is sending in the SWAT team. It's out of my control.
Hostages could die, Calvin.
Calvin? Hello?
That's the prime minister's office.
They're releasing Nelson Mandela.
You're all free to go.
[in Sotho] Thank you.
[in English] Your freedom…
costs too much.
More than you'll ever know.
[Langerman] No.
[in Afrikaans] Langerman, go home.
Spend some time with your wife.
That's an order.
-[helicopter droning] -Because you are now done.
[in English] What's the price of freedom?
I don't know.
Everything.
-[Brigadier, in Afrikaans] Move in. -[officer, in English] Move in!
[officer] Khumalo!
[Terra, in Zulu] We kill dogs!
[Terra] Fuck you!
[Khumalo, in English] Come on, Terra!
[Terra, in Zulu] This will be easy!
[Khumalo] Terra, come this side!
Bastards!
We showed them. We showed those dogs.
-We made them dance. -Yeah.
You know those dogs got me.
This is just a graze.
[in English] Calvin Khumalo, come out.
With your hands on your head, now.
This is your last chance.
For us.
[Brigadier] This is your last chance!
One more time.
[in Zulu] Hold fast.
Hold fast.
[in Afrikaans] Damn it.
Get ready to breach again.
