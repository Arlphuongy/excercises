Will you excuse me one second?
--floating oil, submerged oil...
...contaminated soils...
...shifting submerged oil...
...and recovery of additional environments.
Just the physical damage alone.
A pregnancy is brutal on your body.
There's also a risk from the hormonal changes:
Mood disorders, depression.
Are you sure you still wanna be a surrogate?
Yes. I am.
If more than two embryos take, the couple may choose to abort some.
Well, that's their choice.
Now, he's gonna keep pushing her here. It's deliberate.
The girls always think they've made their decision to be a surrogate...
...but a lot of them change their mind after about an hour with Carl.
Hey, John.
-Hey. -Hey.
It's fine, I'm here.
I'm here.
-So we found someone? -Yeah...
...possibly. Anna Walsh.
She's 21. She lives here in the city, she's a waitress.
And she is brand-new. Just walked in today.
-What would your choice be? -If the children were mine?
Oh, come on, Anna.
Aren't they? In a way?
Life can take an unexpected turn.
You could lose the baby.
If life worked out the way it was supposed to, I wouldn't be here.
Anna, why are you really doing this?
Because I have the opportunity to help someone who can't have a child.
Look at her eyes.
She means it.
I don't like your interview guy. He is a bully.
But I do like her.
I like her.
Okay.
If we submit....
Martin.
-Todd. -Is Grafton gonna settle?
Oh, they're gonna wish they did.
I want you to bring Todd up to speed.
If we go to court on this, it'll be the firm sticking its neck out.
Now, this is still your baby, but I want a second pair of eyes.
Right. Of course.
No problem.
Hey, babe.
Cooper was just in here.
He's putting Todd frigging Decker on my case.
-I'm with her. -You're with who?
Anna.
It took forever to fill out the paperwork, and I was starved...
...so I dropped into that little diner where she works and she was here...
...waiting for her fiancé to pick her up.
She's great.
I know, I know, I know.
There are a million things that can go wrong...
...and we still have to do the health checks and just everything.
Exactly. It's....
I just don't want us to spend another two years looking...
...and maybe missing, and the whole time, she was the one.
She's so shy.
But there's something else there, like...
...I know she can take care of herself.
I invited her and her fiancé Michael over for dinner tomorrow night.
-Oh, babe. -Is it okay?
Well, I'll tell you, when you move, you move.
I'm sorry, but I just wanna do it right.
I really want them to like us.
I'm sorry if I overdid this. We could've just gone out.
No, are you kidding?
This-- This is real nice.
It's what I do, actually. I'm a chef.
I know it's just a meal...
...but I meant it to show you both how committed we are.
The baby is your business.
-One hundred percent. -But you will be carrying it.
In the service, I know a lot of guys who've done this before.
When you're deployed, it just makes sense.
When I'm gone, you two, you know, you come see her whenever you want.
I understand you'll be using the money to buy a business.
Oh, from my uncle. Residential and commercial roofing.
He had quite the run here after Katrina.
Owning the company means you get a piece of everybody's take-home.
Plus markup, overhead.
Mike's always been real smart about money.
With my deployment bonus...
...we'll be able to put together almost $40,000.
And that's enough to buy the whole thing.
Anna, I'm sure there are probably some questions that you have for us?
Can I smoke somewhere?
Nice home you got here.
These renovations must have cost you a pretty penny.
Well, the house was part of Laura's inheritance from her grandmother.
The renovations, they came later.
Must be nice to lay out that kind of cash.
Working by windows, you see a lot of things that nobody else would see.
Weird shit, you know?
Housewives, whatever.
Act like they're alone...
...but they know we're there.
Right.
Benefit of the job, right?
That, there, isn't the right material.
That gutter's leaking at the splice.
Gonna mess up that window.
Yeah?
Look, if we do this...
...we just wanna make sure that you and Anna are comfortable with it.
We are. Of course.
See, it's just that we're down to our last viable embryo, right?
And we wanna make sure that you know how serious our intentions are.
I get it.
Right?
One hundred percent.
We tried for a long time to get pregnant.
I had three miscarriages.
It really put the two of us through hell.
You actually start to hate...
...your own body.
I've never had anything...
...that anybody wanted before.
Except for the obvious.
I've never been able to give anybody anything.
Okay, just spill it, Taylor, you didn't like them.
Okay, him. I mean, we go outside, right?
And he's talking to me about...
...looking at housewives undressing through windows.
Maybe that's his way of bonding.
I don't know, babe. I mean, we can keep looking.
I think doing something like this is really important to her.
Yeah, I know, it's kind of cute. I mean, you see...
...the way she left a price tag on the dress?
She's taking it back tomorrow.
She wanted to wear something nice to impress us.
I did that on our first date.
Oh, yeah, I remember that dress.
Matter of fact, I remember undoing it, like this.
Did I let you?
On the first date?
I was bad.
You were so bad that you were, oh, so good.
John.
I want to.
Having them here...
...it just brings it all back.
-I understand. -I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay, babe.
It's all right.
We're gonna do this, aren't we?
She's the one.
Ready?
All right, hold still.
It's gonna feel like a little stick.
All right. Don't move.
I'm placing the embryo. Don't move.
You're doing good.
And there.
All right. Here we go.
-I'll take that. -Thank you.
All right, we're done. You did great.
Thank you.
Good job.
People always talk about how they know the moment...
...when their child was conceived.
A wedding night or a special date.
But I will know for sure...
...it was this moment.
The baby could be starting its life right now.
It's strange.
It just keeps hitting me how strange it is.
I mean, it's against the law to pay someone to have sex...
...but you can pay a woman to get pregnant with your child?
-Imagine how it is for the boyfriend. -She said she loves him.
She doesn't hesitate, doesn't question it...
...she just loves him.
She asked if it was the same with us.
But it wasn't, was it?
We worked hard.
And we hung in there.
But it was worth it.
Yeah, it was.
When I was working on this room...
...sometimes I would just...
...close my eyes and imagine you in here, playing with our baby.
It's gonna work this time.
Hey.
We're gonna have a family.
We need to do more research on that section of pollution, 11.62.
Once we have that going on....
-You guys go ahead. I gotta take this. -All right, John.
-Hey, babe. Just got out of court. -John.
John, you're gonna be a father.
What?
Anna's here and....
She took a home test. She took three of them...
...and all three of them were positive.
Oh, my God. I'm gonna be a father.
Anna's sitting here watching me bawl my eyes out.
-Babe. -Yeah.
-Hey, Mama. -Hey, Daddy.
-I want her to go to Yale. -No, no. He is gonna go to LSU.
-Law review. -First female president.
Okay.
Anna's in the shower. She's gonna come say hi when she's done.
-Okay. You guys going to yoga together? -Yep.
I didn't know how I'd feel about somebody else's body going through everything...
...but I really like this girl.
I really like you.
-I really like you. -I really love you.
I didn't know he was here.
-He came home early. -No, Anna, this is-- Oh, it's--
This is great news.
It's great news.
This is good work, John.
If this is right, they got nowhere to run.
Well, unless they draw Judge Steve Paulson.
He doesn't believe in corporate negligence.
Invite him to your charity event next month.
The man loves cocktail shrimp and the Saints.
Done.
Will you guys just excuse me for a minute?
She's here for you?
She's a relative.
I called Laura.
She told me to come. I'm sorry.
-Is everything okay? -Yeah.
I had a doctor's appointment. Mike didn't pick me up.
Okay, let's go.
-Come on, honey. -I grew up in a neighborhood like this.
My father, he worked so hard, he didn't have that many days off...
...but when he did...
...he used to pick me up from school.
God, I can't wait to do that.
You're welcome, John.
-So you okay? -Yeah. Thanks for the ride.
Quiet. Quiet!
Guess you forgot to pick her up.
Everything good?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm great.
How's this one working out?
Anything you need me to talk to her about?
Everything's fine.
Go in the house right now.
Now.
Let's go.
It's been a long day, cat.
Move.
Mess with me?
That's what I'm talking about.
What's troubling that pretty little head of yours?
Anna said she'd call me, and she hasn't.
She's young. She probably just forgot.
Told you.
Hello?
What?
-You must be John Taylor? -Yes.
Right over here.
I'm fine.
-You're sure? -Yeah.
-The baby's okay? -Baby's fine. I'm sure.
The perpetrator, Mr. Mitchell, he'll be taken in...
...and charged with domestic battery. He acknowledged striking Miss Walsh.
-You're not gonna let him out, are you? -He makes bail, we can't hold him.
-But he'll hurt me. -He tries to harm you...
...you call us, we'll arrest him again.
You may wanna try to find another place to stay.
I don't have another place to stay.
Yes, you do.
He hurt my face.
I am so sorry.
-It's okay. -I am so sorry.
-No, it's okay. -Anna!
-Anna! -Hey.
-Anna! -Let's go!
-Anna! -Don't move!
-Hey, hey! -Get down. Get down!
I got him. All right. Get him in the car.
-Come on. Come on! Get in the car! -Anna.
Oh, my God.
You're okay, all right? We're gonna take care of you.
You're gonna be fine. Let's get you inside.
Hey, John.
How the hell are you?
I need you to listen to me, Mike.
I need you to really understand what I'm about to say.
This is a restraining order.
It's already happened.
This is a case for domestic abuse...
...battery and child endangerment.
This is a letter to the DA...
...who's a friend of mine...
...recommending no less than seven criminal counts.
These haven't been filed yet.
So, what's gonna happen now is this:
You're gonna stay away from Anna.
We're never gonna see you again. She's never gonna see you again.
In 10 days, you're gonna be shipped off to the Middle East.
And when you return, your money's gonna be waiting for you.
But if you ever...
...come near Anna again...
...I'm gonna bust your head open.
Then I'm gonna make sure your punk ass is sent somewhere...
...that's gonna make the Middle East look like Club Med.
Have I made myself clear?
Oh, yeah.
-Crystal. -Good.
Opening 3.
Have a nice life.
Counselor.
Thanks for the visit.
How is she?
She's sleeping in the guest house.
-Where'd you go? -I just went to...
...make sure Mike wouldn't be a problem anymore.
I was watching her sleep.
She looks so pretty.
John, it's okay. You can admit it. She's beautiful.
Yeah, well, I don't know.
I guess if you're the type of guy...
...who likes...
...soft, young...
...pert breasts.
An ass that you can bounce a quarter off of.
But I hadn't really noticed, I have to tell you.
Oh, sometimes I forget how good of a liar you are.
I love you.
I love you so much.
You know that, right?
-Good morning. -Good morning.
-Good morning, hon. -Good morning.
Thank you.
Anna, we'd like you to stay here with us in our guest house.
We'd like you to take time off of work. We'll pay you whatever you were making.
We'll get you a car...
...so you don't feel trapped. Come and go as you please.
-Are you serious? -Yeah.
We talked about it. We feel more comfortable...
-...knowing you're here most of the time. -And knowing that you're safe.
It's just.... I think Mike--
Anna, Mike hurt you.
And he's not gonna be around anymore.
Not for a very long time.
Now, you are doing this incredible thing for us.
It's the least we can do.
Let us do something nice for you, okay?
-Okay. -Okay.
Thank you.
Well, she is now officially better than me in yoga.
Well, she's 10 weeks pregnant. Give it another five weeks...
...you'll be able to take her down.
Because yoga's all about who wins, right?
She says it's got her body going crazy.
For sex, for men.
I guess it's the hormones.
Anything from the boyfriend?
No. Nothing.
He just shipped out without even contacting her.
I'm glad he's gone.
-Ready for the associate's dinner? -All set.
Laura, sweetie, come on, let's go.
I'm coming!
Sometime tonight, sweetheart.
Oh, my God.
You look like a movie star.
You like?
I love that dress.
You look absolutely stunning.
Can I take your picture?
All right.
Listen, you have both of our cell numbers.
And we'll be home by midnight.
Okay, 1.
I'll get the car.
So beautiful.
It's amazing the way he is with you.
You are so lucky.
Thank you. Thank you, Anna.
And you have a good night.
-You too. Have fun. -All right. We will.
"Today...
...I am happy.
I am in control of my life.
I will experience the joy of pure love."
Sorry.
I was watching TV.
-I guess I fell asleep. -No problem.
I fall asleep there all the time.
I'd like a cup of coffee.
Doctor says I'm allowed one cup a day.
Okay.
-One cup. -Thank you.
-God, it's so old. -Miss Havisham.
She's not old, she's ancient.
I was never really a cat person, but Laura loves her.
All these years, she treated that cat just like she was her baby.
But when the real baby comes...
...we'll have to see how old Miss Havisham reacts then, huh?
I told Laura she's lucky to have you.
A husband who really loves his wife.
Well, I like to think that I'm the lucky one.
I knew you would say something like that.
Do you wanna feel?
Here. Give me your hand.
I'll show you what it feels like.
Wait, I shouldn't say "it."
It's not an it.
He's your baby boy.
You think it's a boy?
I know it's a boy.
I can feel him.
He isn't even an inch long yet.
But you can feel where my tummy's starting to change.
Feel that?
How it's harder?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I can feel it.
He's growing.
Changing every day.
Can I admit something to you?
It's a little weird that I'm pregnant with your baby.
That you're inside of me...
...in that way.
Yeah, yeah, that is strange, isn't it?
Yeah.
But we're grateful for that.
Because without you, we couldn't do any of this.
I like it.
Yep.
Hey, listen, next week we're having our annual charity event...
...here at the house. You should join us.
-What's it for? -We like to raise money...
...for the Boys and Girls Club of America.
You're amazing. Yes, I will come.
What's so important?
Good to see you too.
I missed you, baby.
I'm so glad you miss me.
You look nice.
I mean, living up there in that beautiful big house, that must be nice.
Did you know that you have their only embryo?
-It's a baby now. -And they don't have any more.
And in the eyes of the law...
...since it's inside of you, it belongs to us.
We can decide to keep it for ourselves anytime we want.
-But I-- I thought-- -Don't think.
It's not your thing, baby.
I'm the brains on this.
You're just the uterus.
So here's what you're gonna do.
Every single month, you're gonna say...
...that you're changing your mind, and you're keeping it.
And they'll pay.
Maybe four grand, maybe more.
Mike.
They've been really good to me.
John really wants to be a father.
Does he?
Does he really?
You're into him.
What do you think is gonna happen, Anna?
You'll live happily ever after with him in that big house?
He doesn't care about you.
You are like a cow to him.
I'll do it. I'll do it, Mike. I'll do it.
I know you will.
I'll do it. I'll tell them.
I'll do it for you, baby.
Anything you want.
It's from the firm. And tell Laura she absolutely tops herself...
-...every time you guys do this. -I'll do that. Thanks.
Nobody knows this yet, but Grafton Industries...
...is unofficially floating settlement offers.
-You're not gonna settle with them? -You kidding me?
All this time, you've been telling me we had them by the balls.
I just wasn't sure.
But now I am.
This is gonna lock up partner for you, John.
You take them to trial.
Gut them like a fish.
I'll do that.
Look, I was talking to Anna earlier.
I didn't realize she was your second cousin, man.
-She is amazing. -Todd, she's 21.
My calculation, that's....
That's legal plus three, right?
I'm just checking with you. You wouldn't mind if I asked her out, would you?
No. You can ask her out.
Normally, this is the part of the evening...
...where John asks all of you to reach for your checkbooks.
And I'm sure he'll manage to get that in still...
...but first, I wanted everyone to know...
...how important the Boys and Girls Clubs of America is to us.
Especially to my husband.
John loves children, and they love him.
Thank you, John.
I'd also like--
I'd also like to thank all of you here...
...for coming tonight and....
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now you can all take out your checkbooks.
Is that the dress you gave her?
No. It's not.
You want me to go talk to her?
No, I will.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
-Anna. -What's the matter?
That's not the dress I gave you.
God, I'm so sorry.
It's just, the one that you gave me didn't really fit.
I was gonna ask you, but you were so busy with the party.
I can-- I can go change...
-...right now. -No, it's fine.
You look great.
Thank you for staying late. I appreciate it.
-Thank you. Thanks. -Thank you.
Well, no one fell in the pool.
The rain stayed away.
I'd call that a win.
I found it in your record collection.
Where's Laura?
Oh, yeah, she crashed about an hour ago.
Has to catch a flight at 6 in the morning for work.
So how'd our little story hold up?
It was great.
I was acting out a part.
I had a secret in me that no one knew.
Except you.
You know everybody loves you?
-Shut up. -I'm serious.
It made me think that I made a good choice for the baby.
Well, I thought that we were the ones that made the choice.
I could've said no.
True.
You're gonna make a great dad.
Well, I'm glad it was you.
I am gonna take a bath before bed.
Thank you for everything, John.
Is everything okay?
Something's knocking against the guest house.
Is there coffee?
Yeah. Coming right up.
When does Laura get home?
Tuesday.
So, look, about last night....
Todd Decker, he was....
He was asking about you.
The guy in the gray suit? You know, he was staring at me all night.
Had to be uncomfortable for you.
Can't blame a person for staring.
It just means they like what they see.
Actually, I prefer older guys.
I always have.
Mike was the youngest guy I ever dated.
-Is that your phone? -They'll leave a message.
So I have to go into the office today.
-On a Sunday? -Yeah.
I got an important deposition. You can order out.
I'm not gonna be back until late.
How about we go out to the lake house?
Just you and I, a weekend before the baby comes.
As soon as you get back from Houston.
I'd like that.
John, you're not gonna like this...
...but Chef Folse wants me out here tomorrow as well.
-You're right. I don't like it. -Should I say no?
Should I just come home now?
No, go ahead and stay. It's okay.
-Hey. -I hope you're sitting down.
Chef Folse is offering me a major promotion.
Really?
That's the reason he brought me down, so he could offer me...
-...the CEO position. -Congratulations.
But I thought we talked about, you know--
We have six months before the baby's born.
I told him I could run the company while we look for a permanent replacement.
Why not just turn it down, sweetheart?
I think I should take it...
...even if it is only for six months. But that's assuming you agree.
I mean, I'd have to spend a few days a month up here.
But that wouldn't be until later in the year.
And you could come up for some weekends.
Babe, are you happy for me?
-I really wanna do this. -Yeah, no, sweetheart. Definitely.
I'm-- I'm definitely happy for you.
-It's unbelievable. -Yeah?
And you like spending time with Anna, right?
She might even have a little thing for you.
It's cute. Whatever.
I mean, you're a big boy, you can handle a little attention.
Just congratulate me.
-Jesus. What the...? -What?
No, congratulations, sweetheart. I am so proud of you.
I love you.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I love you too, babe.
Anna!
-Hi, John. -What are you doing?
Look, do you see this?
This is me and Laura. She is my wife, okay?
This is our home. Do you not understand that?
I don't wanna have to say anything to her.
Maybe I should go.
No, wait, hold on. No, no. Please, please.
Okay, look.
Maybe-- Maybe I said something to encourage you in all this.
And if I did do that, then I am sorry.
Hello!
-Hey. -Hi.
Didn't wanna wait until tomorrow, so I grabbed the next flight.
Good. That's-- That's good. Congratulations on everything.
Hello, Laura.
Laura just got a promotion at her company.
Well, it's only until the baby comes.
-How are you? -Everything is fine.
-Welcome home. -It's good to be back.
It's good to have you back.
Hey, baby.
Is anybody home?
Anybody wanna make me a goddamn quiche?
Mike, stop it!
You're drunk. Okay? I was gonna call you.
Before they find out this whole thing's a scam...
...you're gonna tell them that you changed your mind.
-You'll get them to give you money. -No.
Shut up!
You're gonna take that money.
And you and I are heading to Arizona...
...because there is a guy there...
...that's gonna give us another $15,000...
...for a nice, new baby.
If you don't...
...I'm gonna come back here later...
...and I'm gonna tell Laura and John...
...you wanted to take their last baby from them.
No.
They'll hate you.
Clean this up.
Here you go.
Hey! Hey!
Get-- Get back here!
Leave a message and I'll call you right back.
God.
It's so goddamn typical of you.
Some asshole buys you some fancy shit...
...and you fall head over heels for him.
Call me.
Stupid bitch.
Yeah.
You're the brains, Mike.
I am happy.
I am in control...
...of my life.
I feel the joy...
...of pure love.
Hi, this is Laura Taylor. Leave a message, and I'll--
I can't hold the room. I'm sorry.
You know what, let's just go ahead and....
-Should we? -I--
-Okay. All right. -I left a message.
That's the femur.
It's a boy.
I told you.
She's right.
That's definitely a boy.
Honey. No, wait.
It's a boy.
-It's a boy. -No, babe...
...just get down here as soon as you can.
That's my son.
I'm looking at my son.
Look at his head.
That's my son.
-Thank you. -Thanks.
I'm sorry. I had it in my schedule as 2:00.
-Maybe you just entered it wrong. -No, I didn't enter it wrong. I--
Damn it. I know I didn't. I-- I--
Someone changed it in my phone! I know that I put it in right.
I booked my flights around it! I know that I did! Damn it!
-I-- I-- -Laura. Stop it. Please.
Please.
This is the only time we're ever gonna be able to do this.
It's all right. Just don't worry about it.
Let's just go somewhere. I don't know, lunch.
I can't.
I left a client at the airport.
I have to go back.
Anna Walsh on 2.
Hello?
I'm so excited. A boy.
I knew it. Let's have lunch today. To celebrate.
Just you and me. I promise it'll be fun.
-Anna, is there anything actually wrong? -Why?
Because you shouldn't be calling me at work.
Okay? I cannot sneak away, I will not have lunch with you.
I have appointments all afternoon. Like I said earlier--
Mr. Taylor's office. Please hold.
-Anna Walsh. -Tell her I left for the day.
-What is it? -Why are you lying to me?
What are you talking about?
I'd never lie to you, John.
I've always told you the truth.
But not you.
Why are you saying that?
Because I'm right here.
This is for you.
A congratulations.
All right. No, we're not gonna do this.
We're not gonna do this.
Let's do something fun.
Nope. We're not doing anything fun.
What a surprise. Laura's working late again!
Why did you think she would make a good mother?
-Enough! -We're so different.
She couldn't even stay pregnant.
I wonder if she actually even wanted to.
Are you sure she had miscarriages?
Because you know there are ways to fake that, right?
-Are you out of your mind? -You need to be nicer to me, John.
I will leave. The law says I can.
This is my baby. Mike says we can sell it.
-John! -You know what?
Leave. Go. Get out of the house!
-You don't mean that. -Oh, yes, I do.
I'll tell Laura everything. It will kill her. It will break her heart.
But you know what? We'll survive it.
We'll pick up the pieces and move on because that's what we do.
But what about you? You'll be alone.
You'll be broke, with a kid that's not even really yours.
So go for it.
Leave.
I just want you.
-White here. -Hey, Roland, it's John.
Hey, what's up? What, the old man needs another rock looked under?
No, actually, I need a favor. And it's not business.
-It's personal. -Sure, John.
There's a guy I'd like you to look into. His name is Mike Mitchell.
He's Navy, based in Louisiana.
He's been deployed about two months. Just need a history on him.
Anything you can find would be great.
I'm on it. Anything for you, John.
My man.
You wanted to see me?
Have a seat, John.
Look, you know the firm monitors computer use...
...and e-mail accounts.
The system's set up to automatically snag...
...certain types of files, things that could...
...embarrass the company.
Todd recognized her from your party.
She's not your relative, is she?
No. She's our surrogate.
And I don't see how this is company business.
Anna has been getting prenatal care from a clinic...
...that happens to be a subsidiary of Grafton Industries.
She is a patient of the very people...
...we're about to take to court.
That's a big deal, John.
I'm giving the case to Todd.
I hope you understand.
I'm sorry, John. That video got bounced straight to the old man.
I think I just lost my job.
You ready for things to get worse?
I don't think that's possible.
Remember that guy you asked me to run a check on? Mitchell?
-Yeah. -Two years ago...
...he was discharged from the military for some assaults.
Regular dickhead shit.
But after I saw the video, I got to thinking about that girl.
-Your girl. -Yeah, and...?
Well, her real name isn't Walsh.
She got married at 19 in Little Rock.
Before that, she was Anna Devost.
Which is why the surrogate agency missed this.
Marijuana. A DUI.
Nothing horrible, really.
But not exactly the picture of innocence.
So I dug a little deeper.
She was born in Memphis.
Her parents died when she was 3.
Raised by foster parents.
She lived with them for 12 years.
Now, this took some work to get to.
When she was 16, she attacks her foster dad...
...with a pair of scissors.
Killed him.
Seems she had a reason.
The guy was sexually abusing her.
State takes over...
...puts her in psych.
She's a minor, so the records are sealed.
But when she turns 18, she walks out and is gone.
She's dangerous, John.
You're right where you should be.
And you slowly begin to reawaken yourself...
...with small movements.
You appreciate your mind and your body...
...for the accomplishments of this lesson.
Thank you so much.
-Thank you. -Okay, it's my turn.
This was John's great-grandmother's...
...and then my mother and then mine.
I always wanted you to have it.
John told me about this.
Isn't it lovely?
Oh, that's so cute.
Thank you.
What are you doing here in my office?
You picked me.
It wasn't the other way around.
When you're around me...
...my whole body reacts.
I can't think.
I can't breathe.
I need you.
I know.
You want to be a good man.
But how do you know you love your wife?
If you kiss me...
...what if you found out that this was more real?
-Kiss me. -No, I'm not gonna kiss you.
-Kiss me. -No.
Or I'll tell her things that will make her leave you.
Kiss me, John.
-Please, John. -No. No.
-Kiss me. John. -No. No!
I can't live like this.
Look...
...nobody knows what's gonna happen in the future.
What do you mean?
I mean, I know what you want.
But you're gonna have to trust me.
Okay?
I need you to go back to bed.
So will you do that for me?
I love you, John.
I know.
No!
-You asshole! -Whoa, wait a minute. Hold up!
You lied to me! Stay away from me.
-Come here. -I'll kill you!
Anna.
-Stay away from me. -Anna.
Leave me alone!
I hate you!
Okay. Give me the knife. Give me the knife.
-Give me the knife. -No! No!
-Give me the knife. Give me the knife. -I wanna leave!
Relax. Just relax.
-Relax. -Anna!
Stop it!
What the hell is going on?
He doesn't love you!
He told me!
Every time he screws me, that's what he tells me!
-What are you talking about? -I hate you!
Anna, please.
Stop this.
-What's going on here? -Please don't let him hurt me.
-We got a call, a disturbance. -No. She is having our baby.
She has to come back inside.
He's been screwing me. Every night.
Using me. Lying to me.
He told me that he loves me.
-That's not true. -I hate him!
Come in the house. Let me talk to you.
-Don't come any further. -Listen....
-Sir, you need to step back. -Listen, she is carrying our baby.
Sir, did you hear me? Step back. Now!
Now.
Okay, drive careful, ma'am.
None of what she said was true, okay? None of it. Babe, she is lying!
-I never even touched her. -Whatever it was...
...you have been lying to me!
And now she's gone with our baby!
I've never lied to you.
-Did you sleep with her? -No.
-Did you kiss her? -No.
Then why didn't you say anything?
I didn't wanna ruin the experience for you.
I thought that I could handle it, okay? I knew that I was handling it.
And then it just.... It just got worse.
And then she threatened to take the baby and....
Because I couldn't have a baby...
-...that I'm not a woman... -No, no.
-...that I can't handle it, you.... -No, I knew you could.
-I knew, I just.... -No, you didn't.
-I didn't wanna ruin it. -You lied.
Baby, I just didn't wanna ruin it.
I wanted it for you.
I wish I could say that it never happens, but it does.
So when does it become a kidnapping?
Never. It never becomes kidnapping.
Even though it's your egg, fertilized by your husband's sperm...
...it's your embryo...
...but it's growing inside her uterus.
The law views her as the birth mother.
And when she gives birth, it is her child...
...until she relinquishes that right.
Yes, thank you, I'd like to hold for the doctor.
I'm not gonna make partner.
Why?
Anna came to the office, caused a lot of problems.
Think Cooper's gonna let me go.
Dr. Park just got a notice from a pharmacy in Mexico...
-...where Anna bought Cytotec. -She's in Mexico?
-No, she had it shipped here. -What is Cytotec?
Well, it's normally prescribed for ulcers...
...but if a pregnant woman takes enough of it, it could induce labor...
...or terminate.
Where is the medicine being shipped?
I got the address. Let's go.
Hello?
-Is she there? -No.
No, she's not here. Where are you?
I want you to come back.
Not to her. Just to you.
God, I miss you.
-Isn't that crazy? -I can meet you.
I can meet you today, right now. Where are you?
It can't be like it was.
Everything has to change.
I swear to you, if she does anything to hurt my child, I will kill her.
She hasn't been here today.
Box is empty.
I think if she calls again, you know, I could...
...lure her to a public place, have the police there waiting for her.
Except she's not guilty of anything.
She is guilty. Okay?
She ordered a drug to end the pregnancy.
You want me to explain that to a judge?
I mean, you'd win the case, but you'd lose your child.
She could kill your baby today.
You don't have time to bring this to the police.
She was part of the scam and then she fell in love with you. That's what we have.
She could have that baby any minute now. She could be disappearing.
Oh, that girl ain't going nowhere. She loves you.
You gotta put her at ease.
-You need to make her happy. -Make her happy?
-Yes. -No. I know this girl.
Making her happy is not an option.
You're wrong. You're wrong. You give her what she wants.
Convince her you're in love with her. Tell her that you're leaving me.
-I'm not gonna do that. -Yes.
She is in love with you. If you make her believe...
...that you feel the same way, she will stay with you.
She will have the baby for you.
-Laura's right. -No, she isn't.
In her mind, I am keeping the two of you apart.
You convince her that you love her.
When you meet her, you have to make her believe you.
That you want to have the baby with her and not with me.
I don't wanna know what you have to do. I don't ever...
...need to hear about it.
But you do whatever it takes to bring my baby back.
You should take her to the lake house.
Tell her that you're thinking of moving there.
With her.
Stay with me.
The new exhibit's right that way.
Wait, Anna.
Anna.
Oh, my God.
I love it.
It's so beautiful.
Yeah, it was my father's. Laura hates it.
I guess I should've sold it...
...but part of me always wanted to live here.
God, I love it so much, John.
Can we live here?
Just us?
Yes.
After I file those divorce papers.
Just us.
I'm gonna make you so happy, John.
I want you to know...
...everything that I am...
...is yours.
All of me...
...everything...
...forever.
Laura?
Laura?
I couldn't sleep.
It's beautiful.
A leap of faith.
Yeah.
I can't stay long, because I told her that....
Yeah.
I told her I had to pick up some papers.
Okay.
Laura, I....
-It's okay. -No. I...
-...just... -It's okay.
Come here.
She's gonna stay at the lake house tonight.
She agreed to go to the doctor's with me tomorrow.
It's happening. Contractions.
I'm okay. I'm going to St. Agnes Hospital.
Come as soon as you can.
It's our baby.
-I have to go there. -No. No, no.
-She cannot see you. -John.
I know, just trust me. Okay?
Please, just trust me.
Excuse me. I'm looking for a patient. Anna Walsh.
-Are you a relative? Okay. -She's having my son, yes.
-I got here as soon as I could. -Thanks for coming.
No, I'm sorry. I don't have a patient listed under the last name Walsh.
Try Taylor. My last name is Taylor.
-No. No Taylors. -That's-- That's impossible.
No, there has to be a Taylor or a Walsh in there.
-No, I have neither. -She's not here, John.
She never checked in.
Where the hell could she be?
Miss Havisham?
Miss Havisham, where are you?
Miss Havisham....
Are you hiding in the pantry?
What the hell is that smell?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Jesus.
Hi, this is Laura Taylor. Leave a message--
Oh, God.
Okay. Okay.
911, what's your emergency?
Please, come now. She's having the baby.
No!
No, no!
She's dropping. Let's get those fluids going.
Laura. Laura, can you hear me?
She's unresponsive.
-Wide open. -Okay.
We got a female, early 40s. Possible head trauma.
Pressure 85/55 and dropping.
All right, let's cross-type and match.
Make sure the CAT scan....
Hey. Can you hear me?
John?
You're gonna be fine.
Doctor says you just have a bad concussion, some stitches...
...but you're gonna be okay.
Where's my baby?
We can't find Anna.
It's Roland. Yeah.
I'm across the river at Montgomery Hospital.
Anna walked into ER in labor after she attacked Laura.
Gave birth to a healthy baby boy, according to her records.
She left later that evening and took the baby with her.
-Where did she go? -She disappeared.
I told the police to put an APB...
...out on her in every city she's ever lived in...
...including that military base in Pensacola where Mike was stationed.
John, she has that baby...
...she's gonna wanna be someplace safe.
-And close by. -All right, thanks.
The lake house. It's gotta be the lake house.
-No, babe. What are you doing? -John.
-Please, I have to go. -I can't let you do that.
John, I am going to get my child back.
No. No, no, no.
I let you come with me, but this is as far as you go.
Look, we know that she's dangerous.
Just wait in the car.
Hey.
Shit.
Oh, God! What happened?
I got you. Just get in the car.
-I got it. -Come on. We gotta move.
We better hurry up.
Oh, shit.
Cover the baby!
I am sick of you, you crazy bitch.

Time for a little test. Come on, you two.
So exciting, isn't it? [chuckles]
The X Factor or something. It's like the final of
want it to be Mark Dial 0-1 if you want it to be Jack! and 0-2 if you [laughs]
Oh, good luck. You, too.
-Thank you. -Please.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Hello, darling! Hello.
Hello.
[Mark] Hello.
[Bridget] Hi.
We're really doing this.
No going back now. [inhales sharply]
[priest] We are gathered here to celebrate the union
and Mark Fitzwilliam Darcy. of Bridget Rose Jones
And by the powers vested in me,
I now pronounce you, finally,
I now pronounce you, finally, husband and wife.
are you doing with my son? Jack, what on earth
are you doing with my son? Jack, what on earth alone with him again. Well, don't leave me
what I'm doing. I have no idea
-Is he traumatized? -[all laugh]
Hello, William Jones-Darcy.
Are you ready?
-Some champagne for you? -[gasps] Yes, please.
and so, I, Bridget Jones, am a singleton no more. [Bridget] Dear Diary,
Married? Yes.
[woman] Oh, hi, Zeke. Did you hear anything?
[woman] Oh, hi, Zeke. Did you hear anything? [Zeke] Not yet, no.
-[Zeke] Morning, Sally. -Morning.
[woman] You hungry? Run downstairs and grab a box of cereal.
Hey. Shh!
Hey, it's just me. It's just me. Hi.
Did you come down to get some Fruit Loops?
Okay, okay. Shh!
Here you go.
There you go. Okay, now can you do something for me?
When you go back upstairs,
don't tell anybody that you saw Daddy down here, okay?
All right, it'll be our little secret. Won't that be fun?
To have just a little secret between the two of us?
All right? Okay, so remember. Now, shh!
Thank you, Uncle Zeke.
Sally, were you speaking to someone down in the basement?
No.
Sally has an imaginary friend named Melissa.
Hello? Oh, hi, Reed.
Any word about Andy?
Hang on.
Mornin'.
He's not answering his phone?
Well, you better tell the Feds to meet us there.
Sally Ann, where do you think you're going?
Oh, yeah, you bet. I'll see you in a few.
Sally! Go upstairs.
-But I want-- -Go upstairs now.
Ezekiel! It's the damnedest thing. Someone just stole my car!
-You don't say? -It's an '87 Cavalier.
You should be more surprised.
-[sighs] Surprise is for the ill-prepared. -What?
Want a ride to work?
Hey, baby, it's me. [chuckles]
Hey, I fucking got it. When can you get away?
Okay, Shimmer Lake? I'll wait for you. Okay.
Fuck, Zeke.
Mornin', Harris.
Guess you're ridin' up front, huh? Is that right, Zeke? Good.
Why?
-Morning, Reed. Everything all right? -Yeah, everything's just peachy.
-How's the shoulder? -It hurts.
Ask a stupid question.
Actually, when the bullet hit me, it didn't hurt as much as you'd think.
Well, you're a tougher man than I am.
-Thanks for the ride. -Don't mention it.
You know, I'm up for good-natured ribbing between partners and everything,
but when you do it in front of someone, it makes the other person feel weird.
He didn't know where to sit at first, and it was like-- [sighs]
Think I could've been FBI?
Couldn't do any worse than these assholes.
Yeah. Thanks, man.
Did you see anything at the Burton place last night?
Nothing but phantom naked school boys.
I swear to God I saw a naked kid trotting from one yard to the next.
Right. Other than that, nothin'. Nobody came, nobody left.
Closed the bedroom curtains around ten.
-Regrettably. -Lights went off at eleven.
Why regrettably on the curtains?
-Well, you know... -She's smokin' hot.
She's smokin' fuckin' hot. That's why.
-Hey, where is she from in Mexico? -Why would that matter?
Well, I think we'd probably want to vacation down there.
Seriously, though, I did see a naked kid.
-Jesus. Enough already, will ya? -I just... I saw it.
-You represent the Bureau. -[knocking] [Zeke] Judge Dawkins? Can you open up, please?
Why do we care this Dawkins guy went AWOL?
-Well, the bank was robbed on Tuesday. -[doorbell ringing]  Dawkins owns it.
So they robbed the bank, came back, stole the banker?
Well, maybe Dawkins was involved in the robbery.
Why would a guy who owns a bank need money?
That is an excellent question. Do they teach you that at Quantico?
-Rippin' on you. -Yeah, you think so?
Judge Dawkins! Zeke Sikes! Can you open up, please?
Judge?
Sikes. Martha? This is really not a good--
Yes, I will let you know as soon as--  All right, look forward to it.
-Martha's making meat loaf. -Task at hand, huh?
-I fucking hate meat loaf. -[Reed exhales]
Better get 'em out.
Judge?
[Zeke] How many times do I have to tell you guys?
Ed is the guy we're looking for.
Andy is just a patsy.
We understand that you got strong feelings on the matter.
The son of a bitch looked me in the eyes and shot me.
-That's not feelings. That's fact. -Oh, come on, Zeke.
This is where Kyle and I can use the Bureau's resources
to help you catch these guys before they vanish into thin air.
We're expanding the net to a ten-state radius,
we got APBs out to every government agency,
and we got checkpoints on every major highway
in every direction for 300 miles.
-You done? -Yes, he is.
But that was a lot of stuff.
-What if they're still here? -Why would they still be here?
Ed told his wife he's got one more thing to take care of.
-Dawkins was that thing. -What about Andy?
Andy's with Ed.
We got two sets of footprints coming out of the Dawkins house...
And they were going off in different directions.
All right. So what? So maybe they chopped the money then and there,
and then went their separate ways.
Or maybe they left two trails to confuse us.
I don't even see how it matters.
Well, you'll see that it matters
when we find my brother Andy's dead body, you stupid assholes. Oh!
Your partner's being real pig-headed about this.
My partner?
My partner's the smartest guy in the room,
and if you don't see that, you two are dumber than you look.
His partner's not even in the room. I don't even... I don't...
I don't see how that makes any sense.
-Hey. -I'm not stranding you, am I?
No, no. I'll hitch a ride with Beavis and Butthead back there.
Where you going?
Oh, I thought I'd swing past the Burton place
just to see if Ed thinks twice about leaving Steph behind.
Plus, maybe if I stay there long enough, I can avoid Martha's dinner.
-Can you do me a favor? -Yeah.
Just keep an eye on those two.
They seem like decent guys.
I just...
If Andy turns up, I'd rather hear about it first  before he gets gunned down.
You really think Andy's still here?
He was at the house last night.
Any information I get, you'll be the first to know.
Thanks, partner.
How about this?
There's a woman who looks exactly like Steph Burton,  except she's three feet tall.
Yes or no?
[man on radio] Agents Biltmore, Walker, I think we have your suspects.
This is Biltmore.
Yeah. Yeah, that could...  Wait, say that again?
No. No, no, no, no, no.
The Camaro is black and the suspects are white.
[sighs] No, you should-- you should definitely cut them loose.
Yeah, I agree. That is-- It's quite the coincidence, right?
But, no, you should let them go.
I'm sure of it. Thank you.
-Hey, babe. -Pop the trunk!
Hey, what took you so long?
Zeke. He parked outside the house for hours. I had to wait.
That's my girl. Always thinking.
Hey, I don't know about you, but I'm starvin'.
What do you say we stop--?
[gasps] No, please don't!
This is Ed. Leave a message. See what happens.
Shit.
Stephanie? Steph?
-Where the hell have you been? -Where have I been?
In a car, forever! The cornfield!
I spent the night in a junkyard!
Listen, Dawkins has the money.
Dawkins?
Shit. I should've known.
-Why? -Well, that's not important.
What matters is, I gotta figure out a way to get that money
so we can get the hell out of here.
What's to figure?
What? You think Dawkins is just gonna give you the money?
Yeah, it's just... I'm not much of a gun guy, Steph.
-Become one. -Jesus, Steph!
-And go get that money. -[sighs]
[Martha] Oh, please, Zeke.  You can't start a day on nothing but coffee.
-Aren't you hungry? -Um, not particularly, no.
-You worried about your brother? -That's it.
-Well, isn't there anything you can do? -Martha, I'm trying.
I'm sorry. I'm just worried about him.
I know Andy, and he just couldn't do something like this.
Martha, he's my brother and I love him,
but, ultimately, it's gonna come down to how bad he wants to save himself.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why are you crying, Mommy?
I'm sorry, Martha.
You and Sally deserve better than this. I mean that.
It never should have been this way.
But I don't want to make promises that I can't keep.
Hey, Sally, what do you say you and I take a ride in the cruiser?
Really?
I'm not asking people to be perfect, Sal.
Everybody makes mistakes. God knows I'm no exception.
But everybody thinks that they can do whatever the hell they want
with no repercussions whatsoever.
And what is the point  of being the only clean person in a town that's completely dirty?
When I'm dirty, my mom gives me a bath.
Yeah. Well... that's what I'm doing.
-I'm giving this town a bath. -Bath time!
-I thought you wasn't hungry. -Oh, I'm starving.
Then why didn't you eat Mommy's breakfast?
Because if I ate your mommy's breakfast,
I'd end up a fat fucking bastard like everybody else in this town.
Let's just pretend Uncle Zeke didn't say that, okay?
-Okay. -[footsteps approaching]
Hey, Sally.
Do you mind if we drop her off at school on the way to work?
No, not at all.
Get in the back, you fat fuckin' bastard.
-Excuse me? -[chuckles]
That's real nice. That's real nice.
You're a nice little girl.
You know, I'm a police officer just like you.
I may not be the sheriff, but I'm a deputy sheriff.
[woman on TV] Little detail is known of this latest killing,
but the police have identified the two remaining suspects
in the First Mackey Bank robbery.  Ed Burton and Andrew Sikes.
The owner of the bank, Judge Dawkins, could not be reached for comment.
But it's now clear that Tuesday's dramatic shoot-out at the FMB
But it's now clear that Tuesday's dramatic shoot-out at the FMB is anything but over.
-As for the victim, Chris Morrow-- -[phone ringing] -[mutes TV] -[phone beeps]
Hey! Listen, you've got to come and get this money out of here
and give me that tape.
Then just get lost to wherever the hell you guys are getting lost to.
Don't tell me where. I don't want to know.
What? But, Ed-- Hey, come on!
First, you send me to that motel. Then, you stick me with this damn bag?
Whoa! No, no, no! We had a deal! You-- Hello? Hello?
[Zeke] So, what's the story?
Looks like our bank bandits had a dispute over how to split the proceeds.
Or never planned to split 'em with this Morrow guy.
[Reed] Oh, Chris.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Your partner doesn't seem too comfortable around bodies.
Yeah, well, he knew the guy.
You seem all right.
-Yeah, well, I knew the guy. -Meaning?
Meaning... I'm not too surprised. Chris was a little slow.
Got his brain fried in a meth lab accident a few years back.
Same blow-up that landed Ed Burton in the pen?
That's the one.
Well, that connects them. What about, uh...?
-My brother? -Yeah.
You said he knew these other two well.
Well, like I said, everybody knows everybody well.
Some of us even dated the same girls.
But... there's something else.
Andy was the prosecutor in the case against Ed and Chris.
Wait. Your brother is the fucking prosecutor?
He was.
There was a pretty good scandal after the trial
on account of them getting such a light sentence.
Nobody proved anything,
but there was a rumor going around that Ed paid Andy
to drop the reckless manslaughter charges.
Wait, who got manslaughtered?
The file said he got rung up on meth charges.
When the lab exploded, Ed's son died in the blast.
Jesus.
Anyway, uh, when the election came around,
my brother got less than ten percent of the vote.
-You think he took the money? -No, I, um...
Are you all right there?
Yeah, I, uh...
Stephanie Burton called, said that Ed came and went.
So he just came back here to get his clothes?
-He wanted me to go with him. -And you said no?
-I said no. -You expect us to believe that?
Ed shows up here with $3 million in cash, and you just tell him to get lost?
Have you seen my face? I called you, remember?
Listen, we got a dead body in a county that doesn't get dead bodies
and a cop with a bullet hole in his arm.  This is a big deal.
So if it turns out that you're lying, you will end up doin' time.
How much time?
Long enough for you to come out a different person.
Maybe you lose some of those girlish good looks.
Maybe you come out an old lady. -Hey, maybe you don't come out at all. -[clears throat]
Steph, listen.
-No, you listen. He'll kill me. -Nobody is killing anybody.
Tell that to Chris Morrow.
Let me rephrase that.
The best way for nobody else to get killed is for you to tell us what you know.
He's going to Mexico.
He said he had one more thing to take care of,
but don't ask me what because I don't know.
Ed isn't much into discussing business with me.
-So what do you think? -I don't know.
What do you think that one more thing was?
Could be Andy.
-You don't think they're together? -No, I never thought they were together.
I think Ed was planning -to rip those guys off from moment one. -[phone ringing]
So what do we do now?
Sikes. Hang on a sec.
-Where are you? -Mexico. You should check it out.
Drinks are a bit pricey, but the beaches are amazing.
Gosh, I'd really love to,
but I'm kinda busy right now hunting down my brother.
Don't bother. I told you, I'm in Mexico.
Jesus, Andy. What the hell were you thinking?
What was I thinking? Look at me. My life is in ruins.
I'm doing nothing but quickie divorces and hawking life insurance.
Yeah, maybe you should've thought of that before you took Ed's money.
I told you, man, I didn't take Ed's money.
Really? After all that's happened, you're still gonna lie to me?
I don't know what to say.
I want to you admit that Ed paid you to drop the reckless manslaughter charge.
I want you to admit you traded a little boy's life for a fancy car.
You make it sound so simple. What about Judge Dawkins?
Nobody cares that he signed off on Ed's plea deal.
We're not talking about Judge Dawkins. We're talking about my brother.
We're talking about you.
Okay.
Fine.
Ed bought me off.
Okay? You happy?
Andy, you need to turn yourself in.
Turn myself in? Are you kidding me? With Chris dead?
Now that's fucking felony-murder.
Andy, I can't get you out of this.
You either turn yourself in or you face the consequences.
-Where'd the Feds go? -They went to check on a lead.
The old barn. The Metcamp property.
-Someone found Chris's Caddy. -Really?
I think we should have the Feds camp out here tonight,
keep an eye on Steph,  in case Ed gets any bright ideas.
-You know, two guys he doesn't recognize. -That makes sense.
-Hey, who was that? Martha? -Yeah, sloppy joes tonight.
I love a sloppy joe.
Except, this morning, you told me you were having fried chicken, Zeke.
Who was that? Your brother?
You really want to know?
I just don't want you to get yourself into something you can't get out of.
[scoffs] Reed, how long have we known each other?  -That's not the point. Blood is blood. -Exactly.
So let's just leave it at that. Okay?
All right, let's do it.
So, what is it?
-You having sloppy joes or fried chicken? -Who cares?
[man] It's me. No, baby, listen. Don't hang up. Don't hang up.
I know I said that I'd never call you again
but I just could use a little company right now.
Stop, no, no. Stop. Don't hang up.
I'll pay.
I know you're not a whore.
No, I'm not implying anything.
I just-- I just--
I'm desperate.
A thousand dollars? What, are you insane?
Stop, stop! I know. No, you're fine. You're right.
A thousand dollars is right. Just get over here.
It's very, very good. It's very good.
Well, thank you, Ezekiel. That's awful kind of you to say.
Isn't that nice of him to say, Sally?
What is so funny, little miss giggles?
I swear, sometimes, I don't know what to do with this one.
Are you gonna be my new daddy?
Sally, now listen here.
Your daddy is gonna be home very soon safe and sound, okay?
Now, eat that chicken so you can grow up big and strong like your daddy
and not small and weak like me. Okay.
I tell you, you sure have a way with the little ones.
Why didn't you ever settle down and have one of your own?
Sally Ann Sikes, what in God's name do you think you're doing?
[chuckles] On second thought, consider yourself lucky.
You are so beautiful.
I tell you, this is way better
than anything that degenerate Ed used to cook up.
Ed is such a two-bit hustler.
He used to cook his shit with, like, MSM, Lexapro.
You name it, he used it.
But this stuff...
I mean, for a thousand bucks, I went straight to the magic man.
Can I have a kiss?
-I thought you were still mad at me. -[scoffs]
No, I was never mad at you.
You were young, you needed money. It's an opportunity. You took it.
I was mostly mad at myself for being so weak.
-You okay? -Yeah, I'm fine.
I just gotta take a shit, that's all.
-How romantic. -Oh, sorry, honey.
It's not you. It's the drugs.
Sometimes, these things just flush me right out.
-Andy! What the hell are you doing here? -I want the money.
-[stutters] Why would I have the money? -Don't you play fucking dumb with me!
-I don't have it! -Really?
-You haven't seen Ed recently? -I'm afraid you've been misinformed.
You should be afraid that I'm gonna shoot you in the--
Seriously? Under the fuckin' bed?
You didn't think I was gonna search under the goddamn bed?
-[groaning] -Andy, think about what you're doing.
-Ed will kill you-- -Fuck Ed!
He should be afraid I'm gonna kill him!
You know, I just don't get it. Why are you helping him?
None of your business.
Look, you have your money, right? Why don't you just go?
You've got everything. You've got a career.
In fact, I heard you're running for the goddamn Senate.
What does Ed have on you?
Enough. He's got enough. Please, just go.
No, no, no.
-See you around, Judge. -[sighs]
What the fuck? Someone's in there.
-Is it Ed? I'm gonna fucking kill him. -No, it's not Ed.
Please don't open that door, I'm begging you.
-Get your hands off me! -Andy, I'm on my knees.
Please, let's just talk about it.
Once you open that door, there's no going back.
What the fuck? Oh!
Allison, do you know where my slippers are?
Allison?
Hey, Allison, do you know where my slippers are?
I can't find 'em.
I need my slippers, Ally.
Get the hell out here!
Stop! Get on your knees.
Please, I won't say anything, I swear!
-That's what everybody says. -Jesus, you've done this before?
No. No, I... I just don't believe you.
-I'm just a kid. Who am I gonna tell? -Shut up.
Turn around.
-What's happening? -Shut up! Stop talking!
Our Father, Who art in heaven...
Stop praying!
God!
If you tell one goddamn soul, I will fucking kill you.
I was never here.
Get out!
[Walker] Good night, Steph. Sleep tight.
[Biltmore] Let me ask you something. Do you think my wife's hot?
Yeah. Hot enough.
What do you mean "hot enough"? My wife?
Yeah, she's-- I mean-- I said she's hot. She's hot enough. She's hot. She's--
What do you mean by "hot enough"?
-She's plenty hot. -You qualified it with "enough."
-She's plenty hot enough? -I said she was fuckin' hot!
Fuck you.
Fuckin' hotter than Margaret.
Oh, shit. They forgot my chalupa.
-What the fuck is that? -What?
The naked kid! What naked kid? I was looking for my chalupa.
What naked kid? I was looking for my chalupa. Fuck the fucking chalupa! A bummed-out crackhead just streaked us.
Fuck the fucking chalupa! A bummed-out crackhead just streaked us.
Okey-doke.
I think it's time for someone to cut out the hot sauce.
Andy?
Andy, are you awake?
-Hey, what happened last night? -Shh! Just give me a minute.
-What? -What happened last night?
What do you mean, what fucking happened last night?
-Ed fucked us is what happened. -No, he wouldn't do that.
Listen, Chris, I know that something's wrong with you up in the head,
but please don't say that Ed wouldn't do that when he just fucking did that!
-No way. -Jesus Christ, you're stupid.
-Don't call me stupid, Andy. -Don't be stupid, then.
-What should we do? -Check the radio.
Are you fucking kidding me? You dipshit! The news!
[man] ...have been identified as Edward Burton, Andrew Sikes,  and Chris Morrow.
All three suspects are considered armed and dangerous.
Sheriff Ezekiel Sikes was shot and wounded as he attempted to foil the robbery.
Ed shot Zeke? Holy shit! Hey, where are you going?
-I've gotta call my brother. -Are you nuts?
-I've gotta call my brother. -Are you nuts? -He's the one who ratted us out. -We don't know that for sure.
-He's the one who ratted us out. -We don't know that for sure. Who else could it be?
Oh, gee, Chris, maybe it was the cops who pulled us over for speeding
half a mile from the fucking bank!
-We were making a getaway. -Ugh!
I'll take you. I'll just drive you.
No, no! Listen, cockbrain, you've gotta get your shit together.
Your car is blazing hot. -You gotta stash it somewhere. -Where?
-You gotta stash it somewhere. -Where?
Anywhere. One of the barns around here or something.
Okay, then what?
Okay.
Chris, listen to me. Listen good, okay?
You are gonna stash your car in one of these barns.
Then, you are gonna do nothing. You are gonna say there.
You're gonna stay put. Do you understand me?
Until tonight. You are gonna meet me at ten o'clock at Rudy's scrapyard.
Okay? By then, I should know more of what's going on.
Rudy's scrapyard, ten.
-You have a watch? -Sure, yeah.
-Know how to tell time? -It's digital.
Okay, and if you get caught, you don't know anything.
Shouldn't be a problem.
-You're not all gone, are you, Chris? -Not yet, no.
Sorry I'm late. I saw her coming back from the cemetery.
Figured it was better than sitting in front of an empty house. Uh-huh.
-[sighs] Hey, Steph, how you feeling? -How am I feeling?
Like the idiot wife of an ex-con who just shot a cop and split town.
-How are you feeling? -Not great, either.
Has Ed been acting strange at all, lately? You notice anything?
Strange how? Like, did I see him with a bunch of his scumbag friends
sitting around the kitchen table,  going over the blueprints of the local bank,
talking about how they were gonna rob it?
Yeah, uh, yeah, like that.
Be back in a sec.
You know, I'm just asking questions. You don't have to be mean.
-I take it you're Sheriff Sikes? -Zeke.
-How's your shoulder, Zeke? -Eh, it hurts.
Yeah, I'm sure it does. -Kurt Biltmore. This here's Kyle Walker. -Hey.
Kurt, Kyle. Mind if I speak first?
By all means.
Fellas, this here is a local matter.
It's a local crime committed by locals against locals.
Shit, as I'm sure you're aware,
one of the guys involved is my own goddamn brother.
In high school, we all played on the same football team. We all know each other, so...
We all know each other, so... I assure you, if anybody's capable of catching these guys,
catching them before there's any further bloodshed,
it's gonna be my partner and I.
That being said, when it comes time to make arrests,
you guys feel free to take every ounce of credit.
So, if you don't mind taking a bit of a back seat,
we'll be happy to paint you as the heroes. How's that sound?
-May I? -Oh, by all means. Okay.
Zeke, I appreciate your being frank with us,
so I'm gonna go ahead and return the favor.
And go ahead and stop me
if I say something that rubs you the wrong way, okay?
We understand that what happened here last night
is a very serious matter around these parts,
but, as far as the Bureau's concerned, it's not exactly 9/11 part two.
You know? If it wasn't for the fact that the bank is federally insured,
then we would not be down here messing around in your affairs.
So, if you were expecting a couple of, uh... [chuckles] grizzled FBI guys charging in here and giving you the high hat,
grizzled FBI guys charging in here and giving you the high hat, well, you're gonna be happily mistaken.
Kurt and I are like the B team. Well, we're like the B team to the D team.
Yeah, we're the E team.
So your arrangement sounds just perfect to us.
All right. Sounds like we're gonna get along just fine.
Reed Ethington, I'd like you to meet the two gentlemen
our government has sent down here to assist us in our hour of need.
So, let's head over to Morrow's place.
If any of 'em are dumb enough to head home, it'd have to be Chris.
We'll follow you.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
It's my brother's car.
Your brother, the bank robber, drives a Porsche?
It's an example of how the local knowledge might come in handy.
-I'll say. -Care to elaborate?
It's complicated. Let's just see what we find in Morrow's place.
Mice, I'm guessing.
Or a raccoon. Maybe a sheep.
Chris?
Chris, it's Zeke Sikes!
Chris?
Chris?
Chris, Zeke Sikes!
If you're in there...
I'm coming in!
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to get up!
Chris...
-Hello? -Hey, Chris, it's Steph.
-Steph, really? -Where are you?
-[cow mooing] -Oh! Uh, no, I-I can't say.
-Listen, Ed called. He wants to meet up. -He does?
-Andy said he tried to screw us over. -That's not true.
Zeke took a shot at him. Ed had to shoot back.
He made a break for it, same as you guys. No, no, not the same as us
No, no, not the same as us
because he's the one that ended up with all the money.
Right, well, he wants to settle up, split the cash,
Right, well, he wants to settle up, split the cash, and then we all go our separate ways.
Well...
I can't go nowhere until after I meet up with Andy at ten.
No, Chris, just you.
Ed doesn't trust that Andy won't do something stupid.
But he can trust you, right?
Of course, he can trust me.
Good. You have a pen?
-Where's Daddy? -Oh, Daddy had to work late, sugarplum.
I mean, you know, this is all just a big mistake.
Andy would never get involved in anything like this.
Martha, I saw him there with my own two eyes.
Well, your eyes deceived you, plain and simple.
-Oh, yeah? Then where the hell is Daddy? -He's working late, goddamn it!
I'm sorry. I know you're upset, too.
-Hey, how's your shoulder? -What happened to your shoulder?
-I fell and bumped into a tree. -That was pretty silly.
Yeah, well... I'm a pretty silly guy.
See ya!
Gracias, amigos.
-Adiós. -Peace.
Adiós.
-Chris! -Steph?
-Over here. -Is that you?
Hurry up!
Hey, I made it!
Is that... Is that what I think it is?
Shit.
-Chris, have you changed your clothes? -Since when?
-Since you robbed the bank? -Oh, no.
Here. Put on something of Ed's.
Where is Ed anyway?
He went to get a passport. We're going to Mexico.
-[shower running] -Oh, well, that's smart.
Ed's a smart guy.
Listen, do you mind if I hop in the shower?
You want to take a shower?
Yeah. Okay.
I always figured you sorta hated me on account of what happened to Ed Jr.
That was an accident.
Put your gun down, Chris. Relax.
Who the hell are you?
You know who I am, son. I'm Judge Dawkins.
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, Ed and Steph asked me to-- Chris, don't trust him.
Steph, what the hell's going on?
Chris, if he takes the money, we'll never see a penny of it.
I don't want the money. Steph, what the hell are you doing?
Chris, he's lying.
Hey, give me my gun back. Give me back my gun!
All right. Hold on, Chris. -We're gonna slow this down. -Chris, don't trust him.
-We're gonna slow this down. -Chris, don't trust him.
Just give me the tape and leave me out of this!
No! Give me back my gun back!
-We're gonna slow it down. -Chris, he's lying.
Don't do anything stupid.
-Did you just call me stupid? -Don't-- Don't come further.
'Cause I ain't stupid, okay?
-All right, hold on. -You people are always calling me names!
-Don't come any further. -But you don't know me!
-I was smart once! -I have a gun in my hand! Stop! I have--
Jesus, Judge.
I didn't... I didn't... What have I... What have I done?
You killed him.
You provoked him! Why did you provoke him?
Just making sure.
-You manipulative little sh-- -Focus, Judge.
You just emptied a machine gun. There's gonna be cops all over this place.
-Ed. Where the fuck is Ed? -Ed's keeping a low profile.
There's way too much heat on him to risk being seen.
All right, where's my tape?
We'll give it to you when we come pick up the bag.
No! I don't want the bag! I want the tape!
We need you to hold on to the money for a couple days until things cool off a bit.
We need you to hold on to the money for a couple days until things cool off a bit. No, no, no. Just give me the tape.
No, no, no. Just give me the tape. I'm gonna get out of here. I don't wanna have anything to do with this.
It's just a day or two, and then this will all be over.
No! This has gone too far.
Just make sure your wife and kids aren't around for a few days.
'Cause we want to keep this thing nice and simple, right?
See you soon, Judge.
"Rudy's scrapyard at ten."
[imitating Chris] "I got it. Okay. I'll see you there."
Fucking asshole!
Shh.
-What the heck are you doing? -Huh? Oh, nothing.
-What the heck are you doing? -Huh? Oh, nothing. Uh, go back to sleep, honey.
-You're obviously doing something. -It's a... It's a surprise.
That'll be the day.
-Are you all right, dear? You're shaking. -Oh, I'm fine.
You're not fine. You're shaking.
Hey, listen, what do you say the four of us go up to the cabin this weekend?
what do you say the four of us go up to the cabin this weekend?  We can spend the weekend up there.
You can take the kids up there tomorrow, and then get a head start on the clean-up.
I see.
You want to get rid of us  so you can host one of your big poker games.
Uh, well, I guess you know me too well.
Bradley, what's wrong?
-What's happened? -I don't know. I don't know.
Forget it.
I love you, that's all. And, uh...
I wish...
I could be a better husband to you.
It's just a poker game, dear. You don't have to feel so guilty.
Sometimes, boys just need to be with other boys.
-[Steph] You all right? -I'm fine.
-Big day today, huh? -I suppose it is, yeah.
I thought you'd be more excited.
I don't know. When I was in prison, I told myself that I'd be done with this life,
get on the straight and narrow.
Robbing banks isn't exactly straight and narrow.
Then why are you doing it?
-That's a stupid fucking question. -Why are you doing it?
-For you. -Bullshit. You're doing it for you.
What are my options here, Steph, huh?
Okay, we got no money. We got no fucking opportunities.
What are we supposed to do, huh? You tell me, Steph.
-What are we supposed to do? -Nothing, I guess. I...
I suppose this is just who you are.
What the hell do you want from me, huh?
For starters, you could accept responsibility for my son's death.
You are never gonna get over it, are you?
Get over it? It's not a cold, Ed.
-You don't think that I hurt, too? -For what, eight months?
I see! You wanted me to spend ten years of my life in prison
because of bad fucking luck?
The school called us 'cause he was sick!
He had a stomachache and I'm the one who answered!
-I was at work! -So was I!
At a drug lab! And you killed my son!
You don't scare me, Ed.
You only kill people by accident.
Don't forget, Sally's got her ballet recital tonight. Uh-huh.
I want to get there an hour early so I can get a good seat.
That's great, sweetie.
Wait, tonight? No, um...
Sorry, I can't tonight. I got a football reunion.
You're gonna miss your daughter's dance recital
so you can drink beer with a bunch of degenerates.
Is your brother going, too? We asked him. He's gotta work at the bank.
Oh, well, if he can miss it, then surely you can.
You weren't even on the team when they won.
Okay, hey, sweetie. Hey! You know what?
I'm so sorry I'm gonna miss your thing tonight, but I have an idea.
What about tomorrow you and me, we go to Funland?
She's got school tomorrow.
You don't want to skip school and spend the day with your dad?
-Can Lissa come? -[scoffs] No, Lissa can't come.
-No, it's just you and me. That's the-- -Melissa is her imaginary friend.
Oh! Lissa, yeah, sure. Bring her. Bring your whole imaginary gang along. That's fine.
Maybe we can go on Saturday. -There's no school-- -Damn it! What is the problem here?
-There's no school-- -Damn it! What is the problem here?
We are going to Funland tomorrow and that's final!
[sighs] Are you happy now?
-As a fucking clam! -Oh...
Hey.
Sorry, man. Escorting our state champion quarterback
from his meeting with our state champion parole officer.
-Do you mind hoppin' in back? -No, not at all.
-Hey, Ed. -How's it going, Reed?
The back, huh? Never been back here.
-I have. -[engine starts]
My guess is... you don't wash it after the canine unit uses it.
You guys smell that?
No, no, no, it was, uh... -It was Westmoreland. -Oh, yeah. Yes, yeah. Westmoreland.
-It was Westmoreland. -Oh, yeah. Yes, yeah. Westmoreland.
That was the game that Coach Denton called Reed's goal line play on fourth and one,
except we weren't on the goal line.
Yeah, it was an important play.
And I dropped back, and I tossed a pretty little daisy
-right in your waiting mitt. -It was perfect.
You were just so damn excited to finally get your hands on the football,
you forgot we were at midfield. And then, uh... [laughing] And then, that big-ass linebacker, uh...
-Reggie Cutler. -Reggie Cutler.
-Reggie Cutler. -Fuck, that guy was big.
-He just laid you out mid-jiggle. -He was huge.
And then, 30 seconds later, you stare up at me and you're like,
"Uh, did we score?"
And then you said-- you said, "Someone scored." [laughs] Yeah, yeah. That's what you--
Yeah, well, somebody scored, but it sure as shit wasn't us.
Still have that game on tape. My dad shows it on Thanksgiving.
Those were the days, huh?
-[Ed] Hello? -[Dawkin] It's me.
[Ed] Judge Dawkins. Lay it on me, brother.
You've got a lot of nerve blackmailing me twice with the same tape.
Yeah, I don't know. It just kinda felt like a two-chit tape.
You know, now, especially. I hear you're running for the Senate.
Burton, if you ever show up flaunting this tape in my face again,
I swear to God, I'm gonna--
Relax, hombre, you think I'm gonna care,
when I'm drinking piña coladas on some deserted playa,
about you and your 19-year-old fucking butt-buddy?
Oh, Jesus fuck!
Whenever you're ready with those digits, Judge.
It's, uh... six, three times to the left, 28, four times to the right, 86, three times to the left.
28, four times to the right, 86, three times to the left.
Three times to the left. Got it.
You can kickoff whenever you're ready, man.
You want me to take a shift tonight?
Nah, nah. Bank duty is the sheriff's job.
Dawkins will give me hell if it's not me guarding his precious crop money.
Plus, I don't want to ruin your night. You seeing this mysterious Wendy again?
Holy shit! You are.
-Is it getting serious? -No, it's just dinner.
That's how it starts, and then the next thing you know,
little Wendys running all around your house.
I don't know, I don't know.
-602. -602.
-Not 206. -602.
-I got it! -All right.
What? It ain't like one drink never killed nobody.
Chris, we need every brain cell you've got left in your head tonight, okay?
Is... Is he making another stupid joke?
-'Cause I didn't get it! -I'm not fucking around!
-Hey, stop! -Relax! Relax, okay?
Everybody needs to chill the fuck out.
That's what I'm trying to do. This whole thing is freaking me out.
Chris, Chris. Everything's gonna be fine.
-Okay? Isn't that right, Andy? -Five minutes. Easy in, easy out.
You don't even have to leave your car.
Yeah, well, why are we taking my car anyway?
Because everyone knows I drive a bitchin' Camaro
and Andy drives a gay-ass Porsche.
No one has the slightest clue as to what you drive. That's why.
They probably think that you don't even know how to drive.
Of course, I fucking drive! That's why I'm the goddamn driver.
Yeah, and Andy's the lookout, and I'm the one handling the safe.
And if we all just do our jobs, then everything will be perfectly fine.
Look, he's right, Chris. My brother doesn't even lock the door.
I think he figures that the fact that he's inside,
no one is gonna try anything. [chuckles]
Seriously, he must be the stupidest cop in the history of the police force.
-Hey, Ed, can I talk to you a sec? -Yeah.
You know, you really shouldn't talk about your own brother like that.
Shut up. Just shut up.
What's up?
I'm sorry about what happened this morning.
Wow. [chuckles] That's a new one.
Listen, I've... I've been thinking about what you said.
About how you thought you'd left this life behind.
Did you mean that?
Yeah.
Then you should call this whole thing off.
Call this whole thing-- What do you mean? This whole thing was your idea.
Chris, Andy, Dawkins. You said they'd all play ball and they fucking did.
Ed, I'm serious.
It's not too late.
[clears throat] Don't get skittish on me now, all right?  We got this. Trust me.
We got this. Trust me. You're gonna be singing a very different tune in a few hours
when you're a very rich woman.
All right, where were we, boys?
-Evening, fellas. -Oh, Sheriff Sikes, my man!
Listen, I can't tell you how grateful I am that you're going to all this trouble
to help us out once again.
Really, it is no trouble at all.
Great. Well, same procedure as usual.
Uh, the cash will spend the night in here. In the morning, we'll take it out,
divvy it out to the other branches to be paid out to the farmers
when they come to cash their checks.
That'll be going on for a few days. Hold on one second.
-There you go. -Thank you.
Thank you, my man. Thank you.
So, uh, unless there's anything else, I'm just gonna be heading home.
I gotta get home before Allison pitches a fit.
I gotta be there right when dinner is served.
Judge, uh... you wanna...
Oh! Yeah, sorry.
Hey, listen, just as a point of curiosity,
what would happen if someone tried to rob this bank tonight?
You'd shoot 'em, right?
Well, that sort of depends on the situation.
Ideally, I'd like to arrest them without resorting to violence.
Well, shoot first, ask questions later. That's what I always say.
Know what I mean?
Um, not really, no.
Just know that if anything like that were ever to happen,
I'd have your back a hundred percent.
I mean, no matter what the circumstances.
That's awfully kind of you to say, Judge.
Though, hopefully, tonight will just be your typical quiet night at the bank.
Of course. Okay. Well, I hope you brought a crossword puzzle.
Okay. Good-bye.
You move one muscle and I'll blow your fucking brains all over the wall!
Okay, get his gun.
You... You get his gun. You get his... Fuck! You get the gun! Okay. Now, go. Destroy it!
Fuck! You get the gun! Okay. Now, go. Destroy it!
-I can't! -Cuff yourself!
-Too high. -What are you doing?
What are you doing? Smash it! Just smash it! Smash it!
Smash it!
-Smash it! -I am!
Smash it! What are you doing?
Don't fucking move!
Cut the wires! Cut the wires! Just smash it! Smash it!
Uh, yeah! Okay. Okay.
Good! Now, go!
Let me guess. Step two: unlock vault.
Shut the fuck up! Or I'll shoot you in the face!
Hey, what's happening?
What the fuck do you think is happening? We're robbing a bank.
I know, but inside, is it going good?
Yeah, Chris. It's going real good. Super good.
Okay.
Fuck! Come on!
What is this, The Price is Right? How many times you gonna spin that dial?
-Shut up or I'll shoot you-- -In the face. I get it, I get it.
-Do you mind if I finish my dinner? -Will you just shut the fuck up?
Fuck!
What are you doing? What are you doing? Get back!
-Just a second. -Get back! Stay back! Stay back! I'll shoot!
What are you...? Go back! Go back! What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing? What are you...?
Let me see it. You think I care about the money?
It's all federally insured anyway.
You...? You don't care if I take the money?
-Easy, Ed, your accent's slippin'. -I'm not Ed! I'm Doug!
-Easy, Ed, your accent's slippin'. -I'm not Ed! I'm Doug! Schwarzenegger! Arnold's less successful... brother.
Schwarzenegger! Arnold's less successful... brother.
Fuck it! All right. Yeah, it's me! I'm gonna be long gone,
anyway, by the time they get you out of that fucking vault.
Huh? So, here. Good luck.
It's 86.
How do you read that as a fucking eight, huh?
Six, 28, 86. It's his... It's his fucking wedding anniversary.
[scoffs] Yeah.
I can see it now with my... with my mask off. Okay.
Yeah! Whoo!
Hey, Andy, you think when this is all over,
things will go back to the way they were before?
I sure as fuck hope not.
No, I mean, like, before everything. Like, Ed Jr.
It'll never be like it was before Ed Jr.
Yeah. I guess people really don't like dead kids, huh?
Yeah, no shit. They fucking love 'em.
We had some pretty good times back in the day.
You and me. But now, 'cause of tonight...
I'll probably never see you again.
I guess that means you're not planning on shootin' me.
Come on, Z, you think I'm actually capable of doing something like that?
Jesus Christ.
I don't know. You killed Ed Jr. pretty good.
[clears throat] Excuse me?
You heard me.
-That was a fucking accident, Zeke. -Hey, shit happens.
Fuck you, Zeke!
You sound like my goddamn wife.
Hey. Here.
Get in the fucking vault! Get in the fucking vault, Zeke!
And if I suffocate in there before morning,
I guess that'll be an accident too, right?
Do you want me to kill you? 'Cause I can fucking do that!
You know what they say...
"Once you take a life, it's always easier the second time."
I could kill you. I am on the edge right now.
I'll fucking do it!
Fuck! Do not fucking push me, Zeke!
Or what?
Or I'll--
Oh, shit!
What the fuck? What the fuck is happening, man?
What's happening?
You're robbing a bank, Ed.
And pretty soon, you're gonna shoot me,
and then race out that door with the money.
But first, you'll kill Chris. Maybe Dawkins.
But probably Chris, then Dawkins. And once they're dead, you'll kill Andy.
What?
And then, once all your loose ends are tied up,
you're gonna disappear with the money, never to be heard from again.
Except... none of that's gonna happen
'cause I'm gonna kill you...  and I'm gonna bury you in a hole out by Shimmer Lake.
What? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this, Zeke?
What the fuck?
Shit, what's happening? What the fuck is going on?
-Justice, Ed. -Justice... Justice for what?
We couldn't just let you get away with it.
Not you. Not Chris Morrow. Not Andy Sikes.
Not Brad Dawkins.
He wasn't dead two weeks and you were already cutting a deal.
You stole him from us.
You stole my baby.
Oh, come on. Come on.
He was my baby too, okay?
Don't you get it?
He wasn't your baby.
What are you talking about? Stop saying that.
Ed...
Do you remember back when we were all so close?
Steph and I made a mistake.
No.
I stayed with you because I still loved you.
And I hoped seeing that beautiful boy could have straightened us out,
could have-- could have saved us.
Then you killed him.
It was an accident.
It was an accident.
Zeke...
We thought we were doing the right thing.
We thought you'd changed.
He was my son, Ed.
I'm sorry.
Yeah...
I'm sorry, too.
I'm going in.
-The fuck you are! -I'm going in there!
No! No, Chris, you're the driver.
You get back in the driver's seat right now.
For all we know, those could've been warning shots.
-Warning shots? -Yes.
-What the fuck? -No, Chris! No!
-This is really happening, isn't it? -Yes.
-Zeke, this is really happening. -Yes.
Okay. Are you ready?
Here.
Relax. Breathe.
-Does it hurt? -No, I don't feel a thing.
All right, give me the pistol and get the tarp.
Oh, shit! Fuck! Go!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Chris, fuck, it's Zeke! Go, go, go, go, go!
-Why? Why? -[stammering] I'm sorry, Andy. -I fucked up. -[vehicle door opens]
Oh, fuck. We're fucked, Andy. -We're fucked. -[vehicle door closes]
License and registration.
-Zeke? -Back here!
Oh, shit!
[man on police radio] 019. Come in.
-Shit! Oh, shit! Fuck! -[officer] This is 019.
We got an alarm signal coming from First Mackey Bank.
-I'm gonna shoot him. -What? No! Get the-- You stupid--
[officer] Chris Morrow...
-It's your lucky day. -Really?
-Ed Burton shot you? -Yeah.
Ed shot me. Then he took off out back with the money,
and two others took off out front in a blue Caddy.
I took some shots at 'em, but I just got too woozy.
I had to come back in and lie down.
Hi, I need an ambulance and, uh, cops. I need-- I need a lot of cops.
It's just something to numb the pain before we take you to the hospital.
-No, no, I can't. I'm allergic. -You have to have something.
Trust me, I'll be fine.
[Reed] He says it was Ed Burton for sure. He couldn't make out any other faces. He did say they sped off in a blue Caddy.
He couldn't make out any other faces. He did say they sped off in a blue Caddy.
What?
Thank you.
-What's going on? -Um...
I was just talking to Pete and Luke,
and not five minutes ago, they pulled over a Caddy for excessive speeding.
And?
It was your brother.
-Man, Zeke. This is a real mess. -Yeah, it's an old mess.
How do you mean?
I mean, this is what happens when wrongs go un-righted. They fester.
You talking about Ed Jr.?
Yeah, you're damn fucking right I'm talking about Ed Jr.
Eight lousy months he got.
Don't worry about it. We'll get him.
I'm not worried about it, Reed.
in a happy forest, in the happiest tree...
lived the happiest creatures the world has ever known.
The Trolls.
They loved nothing more than to sing, and dance, and hug.
Dance, and hug, and sing, and dance, and sing, and hug, and dance...
and hug, and dance, and sing, and hug, and dance, and hug...
But then one day, the Trolls were discovered by...
a Bergen!
The Bergens didn't know how to sing...
[SINGING OFF-KEY] or dance...
or even hug.
They were the most miserable creatures in all the land.
And once they saw how happy the Trolls were...
they wanted some of that happiness for themselves.
[ALL GASP] Oh, my God!
Eating a Troll made them feel so happy...
they started a tradition.
Once a year, every year...
the Bergens would gather around the Troll Tree...
to taste happiness...
on a holiday they called...
Trollstice.
Good morning, Daddy!
Daddy, wake up!
Daddy, wake up! Wake up! Wake up, Daddy!
Wake up, Daddy.
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy, wake up!
Gristle! What time is it?
It's Trollstice!
Trollstice! Our one day to be happy.
Yeah!
[ALL CHANTING] Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!
[CHEF] Please give it up for your Keeper of the Trolls...
your Minister of Happiness...
your Royal Chef...
Me.
This is a very special Trollstice...
as there is one amongst us who has never tasted a Troll.
Ooh, me! She is talking about me!
Prince Gristle... [GASPS]
...the time has come.
It's okay, son.
I remember being nervous my first time.
Okay.
That's my boy.
[CHEF] It is my sacred duty...
to initiate you in the ways of true happiness.
I have chosen an extra-special Troll, just for you.
The happiest, the most positive...
sweetest Troll of all.
And because every prince deserves a princess...
I give you the one they call Princess Poppy.
Please make me happy, Princess Poppy.
What are you feeling?
[SPITS] That one's rotten!
It's fake?
Fake? Fake?
They're gone?
Where are they?
Don't worry, sire. We'll find them.
I think I hear something!
[KING PEPPY] Go! Go!
[MALE TROLL 1] We got Poppy!
[MALE TROLL 2] Pass her to me! Here comes Poppy!
Here she is!
Ah! There's my princess.
Da-da. [LAUGHS]
King Peppy, some of the others can't keep up.
No Troll left behind!
Thank you, King Peppy!
[COOKIE] Thank you, King Peppy! [MALE TROLL 3] Thank you!
Thank you, King Peppy.
No Troll left behind!
Daddy, where are they?
Don't just stand there! Make my son happy!
He will be happy!
[MALE TROLL] Where is he?
I don't think King Peppy made it.
[KING PEPPY] When I say no Troll left behind...
I mean, no Troll left behind!
King Peppy, where's Princess Poppy?
Don't worry. She's safe.
No Troll left behind!
[ALL] Aww! But we'll be a lot safer the further we get from Bergen Town.
Go, go! Hurry!
[KING GRISTLE SR.] That's right! Take her away!
Get her out of my sight!
She is hereby banished from Bergen Town forever.
We can all be happy again.
I'll find the Trolls!
And shove them down your ungrateful throats.
But, Daddy...
I never got to eat a Troll.
What's gonna make me happy now?
Come here, son.
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
You will never, ever, ever, ever be happy.
Never?
Ever.
Here! Right here!
This is where we will rebuild our civilization.
It has everything we need.
Fresh air, clean water...
and sweet acoustics.

But that wouldn't leave much time for singing and dancing, now would it?
Princess Poppy, do the Bergens still want to eat us?
You bet! [ALL GASP]
But just because it's the only way they'll ever be happy.
[SLURPS] Oh, no. I do taste delicious.
Isn't there anything else to make them happy?
Ooh. What about having birthday parties?

Or staring at your parents while they sleep.
But I don't want to be food.

They're not gonna find us.
No, they're not going to find me, because I'll be in my highly camouflaged...

You mean you're not coming to the party tonight?
[BOTH] But it's going to be the biggest...

Yes. I think everyone deserves to be happy.
I don't do happy.
Branch, I know you have happiness inside you.
You just need our help to find it.

Branch, my man!
You are right on time.
Oh, right. Like you knew I was coming.
Yes! I figured after the third hug time...
getting eaten by a Bergen wouldn't seem so bad.
And I figured there was no way you could do this by yourself.
Guess we were both right. Hmm. All right. Let's do this!
Sooner we get to Bergen Town, sooner we can rescue everybody...
and make it home safely.
Wait, wait, wait. What's your plan?
I just told you. To rescue everyone and make it home safely.
Okay. That's not a plan. That's a wish list.
Oh! I suppose you have a plan.
First...
we get to the edge of Bergen Town without being spotted.
Then, we get inside by sneaking through the old escape tunnels...
which will then lead us to the Troll Tree...
right before we get caught, and suffer a miserable death...
at the hands of a horrible, bloodthirsty Bergen!
Hold on a second, are you scrapbooking my plan?
Uh-huh. Yeah. Almost...
done!
[RECORDED VOICES] We did it!

'Cause it isn't. Bad things happen...

First, you have to give me a high five. Then I'll tell you.
What? Oh, I love high fives. I'll do it.
Oh, I know you'll do it.

I'm gonna tear your little cloud arms...

Would you care to join me for an evening... at Captain Starfunkle's Roller Rink and Arcade?
Would I!
Would I?
Yes! You'd be delighted.
Yes! You'd be delighted.
Oh, indeed, I would.
When are you gonna ask him about Creek?
We have to warm him up first. Don't you know anything about romance?
Of course! I'm passionate about it. Really?
Don't you know anything about sarcasm?
I think I had a sarcasm once.
And I'll take one of everything, Bibbly.
Things are gonna get messy. [BELLS JINGLING]
Enjoy your pizza. Here's your tokens.
Ooh, so fancy. [FLIRTATIOUS CHUCKLE]
Good thing I brought my appetite.
You are fantastic!
Bridget! Compliment him back!
I like your back.
No! I meant say something nice about him.
But I do like his back.
Poppy, help her.
Your eyes...
They're...
Ugh... Ooh!
Your ears...
Your eyes...
ears... Nose!
Skin! Neck!
Skin, neck, ears, nose...
face, back of your head. Are you okay?
♪ Your teeth ♪
Teeth.
What's going on? Are you making fun of me?
Your eyes!
They're like...
two pools, so deep...
I fear if I dive in...
I might never come up for air.
I might never come up for air.
And your smile...
The sun itself turns jealous...
and refuses to come out from behind the clouds...
Knowing it cannot shine half as bright.
I kinda do have a nice smile, don't I?
Yes, you do.
I can't believe I'm about to say this...
Guys, she's going rogue!
But being here with you today...
makes me realize that true happiness is possible.
Whoa.
It is!
True happiness is a lot closer than you think.
It's right here.
Mmm. That's pretty, I guess.
What do you think now?
[GASPS] Creek?
I knew he was alive!
Mr. Dinkles, he's alive!
Oh, snap!
You just talked!
I've been savoring this little guy. [GASPS] Help!
Uh... Mercy!
Tell me, my lady, will I be seeing you at the Trollstice feast?
Well, duh. I'll be working.
It!
It. Working it. You know...
workin' it.
Yeah! You're not kidding, you will.
Because you're gonna be there as my plus one.
Really? Assuming you'll say yes?
Yes! Yes!
Yes!
Yes! Meantimes, maybe we should find some other way to...
work up an appetite.
Oh, yeah? What did you have in mind?
Your Majesty.
You seem to be having...
fun.
Oh, I am!
Meet the lovely Lady Glittersparkles.
You remind me of someone.
She's, uh, gonna be my plus one.
Oh, I see.
For a moment there I was concerned you were changing the plan.
Well, this won't be a problem at all, Your Highness.
I'll just get my worthless scullery maid to get...
another place setting ready for the lovely...
Lady Glittersparkles.
[KING GRISTLE] Put her place setting next to mine.
I want her right by my side...
Hey! Lady Glittersparkles?
Lady Glittersparkles!
I'll see you at Trollstice, yeah?
[SOFTLY] I miss you already.
Ow!
I think the king really likes us.
I know, right?
That was the greatest day of my life!
Thanks, Poppy.
Thanks to all of you!
Even you, I guess.
I just never thought something like that could happen to me.
And it just did!
I'm so excited I could just scream.
Oh, I could scream too! Creek is alive!
Branch, what's wrong?
Nothing. I thought we were celebrating.
That's your happy shout? It's been a while.
Well, you're gonna have plenty of practice, because we're gonna save Creek...
and life will be all cupcakes and rainbows again.
Up top!
Too slow.
[CHENILLE] Yes! [SATIN] I knew it!
Okay, everybody...
let's go save Creek.
No! No! You can't leave.
Lady Glittersparkles is gonna be the king's plus one at dinner.
The dinner where they're serving Troll?
Yeah, I think we're gonna have to skip that one.
No! No, you have to help me be Lady Glittersparkles.
I need you.
I need you. You don't wanna pretend to be someone you're not forever!
Then how about just for tomorrow?
Bridget, you don't need us anymore.
You and the king can make each other happy!
That's impossible! Only eating a Troll can make you happy.
Everyone knows that!
I wish I'd never gone on this stupid date!
Bridget...
Just go! Get out of my room. Leave me alone.
Please, listen.
[CHEF] Bridget!
We've gotta go. Bridget...
[CHEF] What's going on down there?
Bridget, scrub that dish!
The king's bringing a plus one.
Yes, Chef. [SOBBING]
We can do this, Barnabus.
I just have to lose 30 pounds in the next eight hours.
There it is!

Hey, guys! Over here! [GROWLING]
Everyone, get in! Let's go.
Branch, give him to me. Go!

[BRANCH] Everybody hold on!
[BIGGIE] Hold it steady, guys.
Satin, Chenille, sharp right!
Let's do it!
Guy Diamond, glitter him!
Eat glitter!
Look! [ALL SCREAMING]
Hold on!
Creek! [ALL GASP]
Branch! [GRUNTS]
[BIGGIE] We got you!
Gotcha!
No!
He can't be gone.
I'm sorry, Poppy. We're too late.
[CHEF] Actually...
your timing is perfect.
Sorry, but I can't have you leaving before tomorrow's dinner.
A dinner to which you are all invited.
And when I say all...
I mean every Troll in Troll Village.
You'll never find them. Not where they're hiding.
Oh, you're right. I couldn't find them.
But I could with someone they know.
Someone they trust.
Someone...
like this guy.
Creek! You're alive!
[DJ SUKI] He's so cool.
[BIGGIE] Yes!
He's selling us out!
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation. At least give him a chance.
Thank you, Poppy.
I'm selling you out.
No, stop! No, wait!
You better explain yourself, Creek!
As I was about to accept my fate...
I had, what I can only describe as...
a spiritual awakening.
I don't wanna die!
Don't eat me.
Don't eat me. Eat someone else. Anyone else. Everyone else. But not me!
But the king wants to be happy now.
Wait! Wait! There must be some other way.
I'll do anything.
No! Creek, please don't do this.
Believe me...
Believe me... I wish there was some other me-not-getting-eaten way.
But there isn't.
And now I have to live with this for the rest of my life.
At least you get to die with a clear conscience.
So, in a way...
you could say...
I'm doing this for you.
Listen. It's Poppy's cowbell!
My baby did it!
Poppy did it!
Creek?
Uh-oh.
[ALL CHANTING] Trollstice! Trollstice! Trollstice!
Now let's prepare the main course.
The Trolls!
[GASPS] Poppy?
Poppy! Oh, thank goodness you're all right.
I'm doing great.
I got everybody I love thrown in a pot. Thanks for asking.
Poppy? Are you being...
sarcastic?
Yes!
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I thought I could save you.
All I wanted to do was keep everyone safe, like you did, Dad.
But I couldn't.
Poppy.
I let everyone down.
[SIGHS] But, Poppy...
You were right, Branch.
The world isn't all cupcakes and rainbows.

For what?
For showing me how to be happy.
Really? You're finally happy?
Now?
I think so.
Happiness is inside of all of us, right?
Sometimes, you just need someone to help you find it.
What's gonna happen now, Princess Poppy?
I don't know.
But I know we're not giving up.
No.
This is it, Mr. Dinkles. This is it.
Poppy! Bridget?
[BERGEN CHANTING] Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!
What are you doing? I can't let them eat you.
But... Come on!
You gotta go!
Hurry! Go, go, go! Get out of here!
No! Bridget, if you go in there without us, you know what they'll do.
I know.
But, Bridget...
It's okay.
It's okay, Poppy.
You showed me what it feels like to be happy.
I never would have known if it wasn't for you.
And I love you for that.
I love you too, Bridget.
[CHEF] Bridget!
Go on, now. You have to hurry!
Come with us.
And make it easier for them to find you?
No way! You have to go. Now!
Bridget!
Bye, Poppy.
[ALL CHANTING] Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!
Wait!
Wait! Chef, shouldn't we wait for Lady Glittersparkles?
Oh, you are absolutely right.
Now, everyone, there will be no Trolls until...
the king's plus one has arrived.
[BERGEN 1] Boo!
[BERGEN 2] We've waited long enough!
Unless...
Unless, what?
Well, unless she doesn't come at all.
But that's crazy talk. Who wouldn't wanna be with you?
Yeah.
Maybe we should start.
[ALL CHANTING] Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!
[ALL] Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls! Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
[POPPY] Go! Come on. Hurry!
Come on. Everybody, let's go.
No Troll left behind!
Watch your step.
Poppy?
Bridget just ruined her life to save ours. It's not right!
She deserves to be happy as much as we do.
They all do!
All right, everybody. Who's ready to eat Trolls?
[SIGHS] King Gristle...
there is only one thing that will ever make you happy...
and only one Bergen who can provide it.
Bon appetit! [GASPS]
They're gone!
[ALL] Gone?
They're gone?
what did you do?
You ate them!
You greedy, greedy pig.
No! I... [BERGEN 1] She ruined Trollstice!
Guards, lock her up! [ALL CLAMORING]
[BERGEN 2] Let's get her!
Lady Glittersparkles?
What?
But how? Why?
Why did you do this?
Because she didn't think you would want someone like her.
I mean, hello?
Is it me you're looking for?
I don't think so.
Guards, finish her!
Oh! No.
[TROLLS GASPING] Wait!
King Gristle, when you were with Bridget, you were feeling something, weren't you?
Yeah, I was. I just thought it was too much pizza.
Me, too.
That feeling? That was happiness.
[ALL] What?
But you have to eat a Troll to be happy.
Everyone knows that!
Don't you?
Don't you? But King Gristle's never eaten a Troll in his life, right?
No, I haven't.
Yet, here I am.
My belly empty...
and my heart full.
[CHEF] Don't listen to her!
There's only one way to be happy.
My way! [YELPING]
No!
With me in charge...
I'll serve you Troll every day of the year.
With me as queen...
all of life will be a never-ending feast of happiness!
Come on, eat!
Eat!
No! [ALL GASPING]
Happiness isn't something you put inside.
It's already there.
Sometimes you just need someone to help you find it.
Can I really be happy?
I want to be happy! And me!
And what about me?
Do you really think I can be happy?
Of course!
It's inside you! It's inside of all of us!
And I don't think it.

-You must live. -Mom.
Live and take revenge.
It's so annoying. It's so annoying that I want to die.
Can one die out of annoyance?
Scumbags.
-He's here. -Hi.
Kidnapping girls who aren't even 20 years old. They rape, traffick, and even murder them.
They're hustling big time.
Recently, Hwalbindang shut down this whole organization
and returned all the kidnapped children back to their parents.
They got screwed over. Of course they want revenge.
Today, I'll have you meet the head of Hwalbindang.
-He's here. -Already?
He's inside.
The Hong Gil-dong you were looking for.
I happen to have some questions I want to ask you as well.
Damn it.
Gosh, too noisy.
Why are you guys keep looking for me?
It's so annoying.
Hey, why are you sitting there?
Twenty.
Nineteen.
Jang Gil-seong's brother, Jang Dae-seong. Yeonnam-dong, Apartment Sinseong 102-403.
-What? -Yang Jin-tae's mom, O Yeong-ja.
Hospital visit for a gastric ulcer.
Jeong Ho-il's wife, Kim Gyeong-suk, went to her parents' house two days ago.
Starting now, if I pause for more than 20 seconds, your family members will die.
They have guns in their mouths right now. I'm sure none of them were able to be reached today.
What are you talking about?
One. I'll kill Jang Dae-seong first.
Enough.
-Did you hear that? -Yeah.
-That's Dae-seong's voice. -All of you, guns on the table.
If you do that, I'll let you hear their voices.
Twenty, nineteen, eighteen...
My mother is seriously ill. Gil-seong!
What should we do now? Give him the gun.
Let us hear their voices now! Why did you get my innocent brother involved?
-Why Gyeong-suk-- -No! Shut up!
Two, one.
Don't believe in everything I say. Because they all are lies.
Gosh, so noisy.
You guys ever heard of Kim Byeong-deok?
Ever heard of him or met him?
I heard the name came out from one of your mouth.
Anyone who gives me useful information is free to go.
Me. I know Kim Byeong-deok.
Where is he?
What? Well, you know.
-He's in Yeonsin-- -I'm an expert in deception.
And I'm good at detecting lies, too.
-I'm sorry. -Stop lying. You're pissing me off.
We're going to start cutting your fingers now.
Starting with Jeong Ho-il. -Both of you can cut them for him. -Please spare me.
"Please spare me"?
I'm sure you're used to hearing that.
I'll ask again once Jeong Ho-il is done. Just shut up and cut.
If you try to delay or open your mouth,
I'll blow your head one by one.
How dare you
go up against Hong Gil-dong.
Name, Kim Byeong-deok.
They said he's blind in his left eye. Seems like they're right. He's in Gangwon-do, Hwacheon-gun, Dogye-myeon.
-Myeongwol-ri 94-3. -Myeongwol-ri 94-3. I know.
President Hwang, I'll be back before dawn. That's after I kill Kim Byeong-deok.
Please stick to the hit list. -And use torture only when necessary. -Enough.
Understand? Don't make innocent people suffer--
My name is Hong Gil-dong. A private detective of an illegal detective agency, Hwalbindang.
Even though it's a dangerous job dealing with all sorts of scumbags, I've been handling it quite well.
And it's been rather easy.
Nobody knows me.
Even I don't know who I really am. The one thing I remember is my name.
Anyway, I'm going to meet someone very special today.
I always manage to find people that I look for in a day. But I wasted 20 years looking for this guy.
I found out his name only recently.
The only person that's left in my fragmented memory.
The man with a blind left eye, Kim Byeong-deok.
Wait for me.
I'm coming.
MYEONGWOL-RI
What the hell?
Why did you give me so much rice?
-That's mine. -Is it yours?
I going to eat a lot.
Sorry, I didn't know that.
I made this seasoned bracken. Try some.
It tastes bad. I want to eat sweet and sour pork.
Tomorrow, I'll fry eggs for you.
Give it one bite.
Good girl.
Look at my darling eat.
Dong-i, are you still collecting bottles and selling them?
Why don't you listen to me? Only beggars do that.
You did it too. How is that for beggars? That doesn't mean you get to do it.
But if I save a little more, I can buy your eyeglasses.
Dong-i, you need to study hard. Stop talking about eyeglasses.
If you do it again, I'll go to your school and report to them.
Promise me.
Don't do it again, okay?
Tomorrow, we need to pack up, so come straight home.
Mal-sun, you too. Don't play at school. I don't want to move.
If we move, we can go eat some sweet and sour pork together.
My goodness.
No one's after your food. Eat slowly. It's okay.
Hang in there. Dong-i will bring you some water.
Gosh, you are so impatient.
Were you that hungry?
Why didn't you eat slowly?
My sweetie.
Stay still. Let me wipe it.
Grandpa. There's someone outside.
Dong-i and Mal-sun.
-Yes? -Yes?
I might have to go outside for a moment.
Don't worry and wait for me. I will come back in a minute. Where are you going this late?
I'll be gone just for a second. Don't report to the police.
Never report to the police.
Even if the police come here, don't tell them anything. Okay?
Hurry up and hide in the backyard.
Grandpa, what is it?
Just do as I say. Take Mal-sun and hurry up.
Old man, why don't you come with us?
Tell whoever sent you here to come see me directly.
If there's no other business, get out of here.
Gosh, I don't have time for this.
Old man, just come with us.
You scumbag!
Why did you push me? We wanted to take you peacefully.
Dong-i.
-Grandpa! -Grandpa!
We're meeting him at the factory, right?
What? Gosh.
What is that?
Damn it.
Don't get out of the car. Does he have to do this on this narrow street?
-Looks like he's leaving soon. -A flat tire, perhaps.
What is this?
Gangwon 5, 7102
Kim Byeong-deok, 94-3.
RENTAL AGREEMENT
MYEONGWOL PHARMACY
That old man was Kim Byeong-deok.
Why now?
Who are you?
My enemy's grandchildren.
I'm disgusted.
Who are you, mister?
He looks like a policeman.
Why is a policeman here? We didn't report anything.
Grandpa said not to report to the police. Looks like he is a bad guy!
Sorry for not introducing myself.
I am a government employee from Chuncheon who's responsible for registration.
Registration Department?
Dongjin Elementry School, class 5-12, Kim Dong-i. Class 1-8, No. 33, Kim Mal-sun.
Your grandfather's full name is Kim Byeong-deok.
Suffering from arthristis and diabetes from trash picking.
And you guys are moving soon, right?
How do you know that?
This house has a deposit of 100,000 won with a monthly rent of 20,000 won.
This village will soon be developed.
And according to the clause 54 of the land registration
and compensation law, the area needs to be vacant by October.
So I need to meet your grandpa today. I know your grandpa very well.
Dong-i, you got perfect scores in three tests. He was so proud of you.
Now you understand, right? I got perfect scores in my tests, too!
What's up with this kid?
Anyway, there's a chance I can help you to find your grandpa.
-Help us to find Grandpa? -I can find him in an hour.
But both of you need to come with me.
But our grandpa told us to wait here.
Then I guess I'll come back next time. Didn't you say you were going to help us to find him?
You'd never understand
why I need both of you.
That route leads to three possible locations.
One towards the main street of Gagok-ri, downtown of Yongdam-ri, or
to this abandoned factory at the end of the road
that leads to a remote mountain.
Straw.
Gunshot.
Choi Tae-jeong.
He's calling someone.
Look up for registration number. "Gangwon 5, 7102." What's this car--
Head of Hwalbindang, President Hwang Gye-suk.
She does numerous charitable work with her immense wealth.
Twenty years ago, her father took me in when I was an orphan.
So we grew up together. "We work for justice."
As per her late father's will,
she organized a detective agency and put me as the head.
But to be honest, I'm not that into it.
TELEPHONE DIRECTORY
They want to spread the fear of war.
For money and power, Gwangeunhoe is ready to do anything.
You sound quite delusional.
You're so passionately talking about such a baseless story.
Ma'am.
There's no such thing as Gwangeunhoe.
Ma'am.
-Ma'am! -What?
What do you need?
Oh, goodness.
So frustrating.
I forgot the price.
Wait a minute.
How much is the caramel candy?
It's 200 won, but because you're handsome, just pay 100 won.
Keep the change.
Is there anyone who raises cattle?
The footsteps and straws from the barn.
Wearing slippers in this cold weather.
His house must be nearby.
Kidnapping?
Damn it.
So what? Do you have proof?
Where did you park your car? You have the car key, right?
What the...
You seems to know something. Does Chief know you're here?
He's a cop. Don't make assumptions. I didn't do anything.
I'm not making assumptions.
This evening at 7:08 p.m.,
You, Kim Jin-ho, and Choi Tae-jeong drove a car with plate number 5-7102 and kidnapped Kim Byeong-deok.
Then you passed him off to your chief for some money.
Then you went out for a drink and drove back home when you got cold and tired.
Jin-ho, don't you remember me?
-What? -I was changing the tires on the road.
How else could a detective like me know all about this and block that road earlier?
We've been tracking the chief for a while.
If you talk nonsense one more time, I won't be asking politely anymore.
Think before answering me. Who do you think you're lying to?
I was just the driver.
The chief will be calling you now.
Just answer it and be cool.
You just have to tell me where the car is.
Where's the car?
The place where we met yesterday. Come out. Give me the car key.
Where's the place?
That place is...
-Mister! -Mister!
-You need to go outside-- -Mr. Registration!
Found him.
Did you find my grandpa?
What are you doing? This man is from the Registration Department.
I'm Kim Mal-sun.
-My grandpa-- -What the...
Are you really a detective? I knew it. Who are you?
-First, tell me where the place is. -Get out.
Get out of here if you dont want to be dead.
Hurry up and get the hell out.
Mister, why did you lie and tell him that you're a detective?
Dong-i, he's weird.
-Mal-sun. -Why did you bring this?
What if someone steals this? Grandpa took these pictures for us.
I almost had it, but they blew it. Should I just tie them up and throw them in the trunk? What?
You have only two left? Don't lose them.
He's going somewhere.
What? No.
Can we come with you? -No. -Let's go together!
Gosh. Those brazen kids.
I'll deal with them later.
A cop kidnaps someone instead of making an arrest.
They didn't kill him, which means there's no grudge or revenge.
It's not like they can get money out of that old man. It's definitely not for money.
The old man probably knows something, or has something.
Someone came to me.
Who?
I don't know. He asked me this and that. So I sent him away.
-Mister! -Mister!
-Damn it. -Mr. Registration!
What is that sound?
-Did you walk here? -Yes, why?
Damn it!
Where are you, Mister?
How could I miss that? Kim Byeong-deok, I'll catch you.
And with my own hand... Where's my caramel candy?
Did I drop it while running?
Nothing's going right. I don't even have money.
Mister,
where are we going?
Is Grandpa doing okay?
-Hey. -Yes?
Stop talking.
Wait.
Is that money?
I wonder what that was.
Hold on. Welcome!
The largest room with a phone for one night, please.
I knew I'd have guests today.
The magpies kept chirping this morning.
That'll be 8,500 won.
Oh.
Okay.
Shabby second-hand furniture.
Opened just a few days ago. With a 1,000 won discount.
Removed tattoo. He's ashamed of his old gang life.
Is it 7,000 won then?
And he's downright stupid. I can just give you 1,000 won back, right?
By the way, you are such a cutie-pie.
Hold on.
I actually bought these
to stop smoking, but I'll give these to you instead.
Take these.
Is she your daughter? -Or niece? -No.
My grandpa got kidnapped and this man is trying to--
Say thank you to this mister. Good girl.
What is he talking about?
Gosh.
-I'm a public prosecutor. -What?
I'm protecting the victim's family.
I'm not supposed to be taking care of these things,
but it's a long story.
I'm new, so I'm just following orders. Anyway, just pretend you didn't hear anything.
Oh, he's a prosecutor.
Kids, let's go uptairs.
Grandpa's kidnapped?
Oh my.
A prosecutor?
Wolgye-ri and Gudam-ri are out of range.
He didn't even blink when he lied.
Why did he have to lie?
Mister, you haven't slept since yesterday. You should get some rest.
Hello, may I speak to Tae-jeong?
Tae-jeong? Who's that?
Hello, may I speak to Choi Tae-jeong?
There's no one by that name.
Oh, it's you.
Is he in there? Oh, hi.
I have something to tell you.
I'm busy.
Sorry for disturbing you.
I'm a bit impatient.
I used to be a gangbanger, you see.
But now of course, I'm back on the right track. I don't even go near it.
Here's what I'm trying to say. So I opened this inn in a hurry.
Let me be honest.
-Everything here is pre-owned. -I brought a notebook.
Good girl.
I found them from some cave with a huge door.
I don't know who built the cave, but it looks quite odd.
And when you go inside,
you can find furniture like these all over the place.
So what?
Oh, where was I going with this?
Oh, yes.
So I went there to get a couple chairs.
And I saw something strange in there.
Hello? Is Tae-jeong working today?
Tae-jeong? He's not here today. Who's this?
Of course he's not there.
-Let's talk later. -Okay.
Where are you going?
Stay here quietly. We will come with you and be quiet!
If they are under your protection, you should take them with you.
Lubricant stain on the gloves. Oily nails. He must've been working here until yesterday.
TAEGWANG REPAIR
The long-haired Choi Tae-jeong.
What the heck?
Oh, yeah. I fell and hurt my knee yesterday.
My gosh.
Don't go on your own like that.
-You two, come here. -What's up?
Hey, do you want to find your grandpa or not?
Of course we do.
I won't be able to if you keep behaving like this.
If you can't help, at least try not to slow me down.
But you lie all the time.
This is how this works! Will you stop if you know nothing about it?
Watch your mouth if you want to live longer.
That gave me goosebumps.
Seven fourteen.
Is he still here?
This will be the first election we are holding in the 80's. The candidates...
Can I help you?
My staff is off today.
Well, youngsters these days don't appreciate their work.
A pessimist that I hate the most. I should shut down the shop.
-I've had enough of this place. -The 24th.
It's not like I'm gonna get rich.
Who was coming on the 24th again?
The governor. He has something important to announce and asked everyone to attend.
Things are already depressing enough.
What's he going to blab about at that late hour?
By the way, you don't seem like you're from around here. How did you know about the 24th?
I heard about it, but it slipped my mind. That car outside, number 7102. When did it get here?
Someone left it here about ten minutes ago.
Why are you asking? Ten minutes ago would be 7:05 p.m.
Could I see the estimate?
I'm from the insurance company-- Actually,
He's a detective. And he's in the homicide division.
What's a homicide division?
A higher class detective.
Please, shut up!
Why? Didn't you tell me to act like this? I'm trying to help you.
She's so cute.
Actually, I'm a police officer.
Can you give me the contact info for the car? What's a cop doing here--
My grandpa was kidnapped by some bad guys. -And he's helping us find him. -You can't say that.
-And he's helping us find him. -You can't say that. He told us not to say that.
Oh, right.
Their grandpa was kidnapped?
-Yes. -Their grandpa?
-Yes. -That car is the criminal's?
Yes, so hurry up and give me the contact info already!
Mister, how did you find the criminal so fast?
You're awesome.
Isn't he, Mal-sun?
Yeah, I guess he is, but there's still something fishy.
You two.
-Do you think I'm a good guy? -Yes.
You guessed incorrectly. You're completely off.
I'm warning you for the last time.
If you try to butt in again, then I'll-- Are you really a Registration Department employee?
I am.
It really is true.
So please don't go around and talking nonsense.
But maybe all these people can help us later.
They can't help us, so shut your mouth! Here, Mister.
You kept looking at these. Did you want some?
Seriously!
Please! Wait here!
What's in the bag? Nothing's in here.
I can't get through these kids. I should give them a taste of fear.
Where's Kim Byeong-deok?
Det. Kang Seong-il of Force Team 1 at Hwacheon Police Division.
I'm not sure what you guys are up to.
Just hand Kim Byeong-deok over and I'll let you off the hook.
I would normally teach you guys a lesson. But I have something personal to take care of.
Why are there so many papers?
Why are you looking for Kim?
What are you saying, you idiot?
-That's none of your business. -You are Hong Gil-dong, aren't you?
Looking for Kim Byeong-deok
to get even?
-Who are you? -I thought you can't remember the past.
But I guess you didn't forget his face. Right. How can one forget that incident?
-What are you doing? -Don't move.
If you want to shoot, aim it at me.
Try to guess where I know you from.
If you make it out of here alive, ask yourself.
Where the old man is.
And who you really are.
Who the hell are you?
Run, Gil-dong.
-You must live. -Mom.
Live and take revenge.
Put this plaster on the wound! Apply this first.
What pill is he taking?
Mister.
He recognized me right away.
He knew me.
Did you ask the bad guy
where my grandpa is?
And even the reason why I'm here.
How did that bastard know everything?
Search all the inns. The kids are with him.
-Bring them here. -Yes, sir.
Old man, Hong Gil-dong was here.
Why did he have to come now of all days?
And same to you. Why now? Why are you two trying to ruin my plan?
Hey, my Dong-i and Mal-sun--
Kids?
The kids are not important right now.
Aren't you here because of your foolish acts?
Why did you keep it until now?
How dare you.
Humans make mistakes when they are too carefree.
Like you did.
Once this is done, a new world will come. I'll make that happen.
Where's the book?
If you let me go with my kids, I'll give it to you--
APPROVAL DOCUMENTS WORK LOGS
Kang Seong-il's documents.
"A complete police staff replacement from October 21, 9:00 a.m."
If it's the 21st, then it began yesterday.
"Received nine Browning 25s, three Tokarevs, and twenty-four PPS 43s.
That was 7:00 p.m., October 22nd. The chief of the police will be on vacation starting October 22nd.
All police support will be stopped at 6:00 a.m. on October 23rd.
The telephone exchange offices will stop operating in two-hour intervals,
starting from 3:00 p.m. on October 23rd.
At 1:00 p.m. on October 24th, the route to Myeongwol-ri will be closed.
At 9:00 p.m. on October 24th,
complete the mission at the village lot. Must leave weapons at the site."
What does this all mean?
If it's on the 24th, that'll be in three days.
So this is it.
These idiots are interesting. Kim Byeong-deok and Kang Seong-il.
What's going on between the two and I?
Anyway, I need to find Kim first.
PLASTER
Welcome.
A man in a brown jacket with two little girls.
He has a scar in his face. Did he stay here?
Is there a bigger table? The table is so small that I can't work.
I'll get you a bigger one. I bought some snacks for the kids.
Some policemen will come later today.
The one with shiny hair and with glasses. He's the kidnapper.
A policeman is a kidnapper?
He's obviously a corrupt policeman.
He will be asking you if I was here.
He must've been here yesterday. Tell him that I was here
and that I'll be back tonight.
Yes, he was here last night.
He said that he will come back.
I think he's going to come back this evening.
I'm out of money. Send me some.
That's going to be difficult.
Nobody can go there. Everyone's out doing stakeouts and research.
I need to go to the site too. And I can't just send you anyone. It's dangerous.
Can you make it short? I only have 10 won left. You should've told me that earlier.
Do you know what I went through yesterday? I'm really busy.
The owner of the car number 7102 is Kang Seong-il--
I know.
And now you want me to pay double to buy them again?
It'll be difficult to even contact them. We don't have time to take all them out.
Are we sweatshop workers?
And what is the movie for anyway? -You said you'll be back in a day. Why-- -Whatever.
-You said you'll be back in a day. Why-- -Whatever.
Just send the money over if there's someone available.
No one's helping me out here.
You can still eat it if you wash it.
Now, how can we find Grandpa?
With this face, how...
Mister, I thought about it.
Those bad guys probably locked up Grandpa in an abandonded building.
In Yongdam-ri, there are a lot of abandoned buildings.
The owners rarely visit.
-We could go there. -No need to look. -I know where he is. -You know it?
-I know where he is. -You know it? You know it? Seriously?
It's not in Yongdam-ri. The building without an owner.
How does he know? That's impressive. Very impressive.
But we need to go somewhere first.
Dong-i. Mal-sun.
Can you help me with something?
-Yes, we'll do it! -Yes, we'll do it!
How can we help you?
You just need to say a few words. I'll tell you what to say.
Don't say anything unnecessary. Yeah, same to you.
That day, Kang Seong-il departed at 6:17 a.m.
He arrived at the repair shop at 7:05 a.m. without Kim. It took him 50 minutes.
He drove 70 km per hour for a 20-minute ride.
If it's within 9 km from Dong-i's house and 3 km from the shop, Kim Byeong-deok is here.
Are there any vacant houses around this area?
Oh, it's near the repair shop.
Yes, there's a vacant buidling in this area.
But may I ask who you are?
You just told me, but I still don't understand.
-And what happened to your face? -Let me introduce him.
He's manager Jeong Myeong-su from the Department of Land Construction.
Right now, we are doing a survey
about land population.
We're doing a one-on-one field trip with employees of the district government office.
I'm actually in the first grade. And I'm just tagging along with my sister.
Now you know who he is, right? Looks like you now understand.
Here you go. Drink up.
Thank you.
-How old are you? -Eight years old.
Eight years old?
-What grade are you in? -Fifth grade.
-Do you get good grades? -Not me, but she does.
That's okay. As long as there's something you want to do.
-My grades were terrible. -Really?
EXAMPLE, HONG GIL-DONG, KANG TAE-GONG
That building has no owner. Here's the map.
We don't even know who built it or when it was built. I only went there once.
I wasn't sure if it was built for people to live there. It was strange.
We don't even know who owns the land in that area.
Lots of problems. It's weird.
-Thank you. -Of course.
What is she writing?
Mister.
What's your real job?
What is your name?
Mal-sun, if you are going to talk nonsense again-- I said, what is your name?
Mister.
Park Du-chil.
He just made it up.
You think so too, right? Who would name a person Park Du-chil? Don't lie.
Wait. Is this the right route?
Why are you changing the subject? Who are you? I said I'm Park Du-cheol!
-You said Park Du-chil earlier. You lied. -Seriously, you two.
Is this what your grandpa taught you? Being rude to adults like this?
Mal-sun, he wouldn't lie to us.
Is your name really Park Du-cheol?
It really is.
I'm sorry for suspecting you.
By the way,
is Grandpa going to be at the place?
Grandpa!
-Grandpa! -Grandpa!
Kim Byeong-deok is here.
This time, I'll catch him no matter what.
-Grandpa. -Wait.
There's nothing here.
This can't be.
Dong-i.
Mal-sun.
Is there anyone there?
It's weird.
Why is nothing working out?
Mister.
Is Grandpa eating well?
Is he sleeping in a warm place?
He's eating well and getting good sleep.
So stop asking me that.
What? You don't believe me?
No, I trust you.
Dong-i and Mister, I miss my grandpa so much.
Be quiet, Mal-sun.
Just eat your Jajangmyeon.
It's good, right? Eat up.
You're eating so well. Is it yummy?
Just eat this.
Don't you have other relatives except your grandpa?
-An aunt or something like that. -Nobody.
Only me, Dong-i, and Grandpa.
But Dong-i is so smart that she has a lot of friends.
You have no friends, right?
-Why are you asking? -You don't look like you do.
Mal-sun.
Dong-i said that you're a very kind person.
Do you mind if we become your friends?
-No. -Then starting now, we're friends!
Hey!
Why are you touching me like that?
-What is it? -Mal-sun, stop.
-Stop it. You're gross. -Mal-sun.
-Sit down. -Please stop.
What?
Is this on the house?
Mister, you can have it first.
Let's eat together. Friends are supposed to share.
-Mal-sun, come here. -Is there something on my face?
Why is your face so messy?
It's impossible for him to have friends.
He's not likable.
Because in his heart, there's a black bruise.
We found them all. Should we catch them?
Of course. Why do you even ask? Bring them in.
Okay and this is about Gwangeunhoe.
Years ago,
he witnessed his mother's death with his own eyes.
Since then, he became a bit abnormal.
I don't know if it's related to that, but something's wrong with his brain.
It cannot process fear.
In short, he's fearless.
Don't talk to him. Just shoot him.
He never gets much sleep because of nightmares. He constantly takes pills.
What's this? There's nobody here.
Hold on.
Let me think.
Thinking will be useless.
What's so funny?
Didn't Kang Seong-il come?
Receive guns at 7:00 p.m. on the 22nd.
How busy is he? I'm a bit upset.
Let's go.
I think we lost him.
He was probably waiting for us.
Never mind. He'll come here for sure.
Long time no see.
Nine Browning 25s, three Tokarevs, and twenty-four PPS 43s.
You can check them.
Those scumbags wouldn't talk till the end.
They would even give up their lives for it.
What made them so devoted?
I'll compensate you later for your time.
What's going on, really?
She's the owner of this bookstore.
He's a prosecutor. Please treat him well. You know the attic uptairs...
We will always be on the people's side.
Our nation is at the doorstep of a new world.
When the enemy becomes brave enough to provoke,
whenever and in whatever situation,
I will defend and protect our nation at all costs.
If you believe in me,
we, the strong people, will do our best to protect our nation and our people!
I'm going to sleep.
If you're already awake, just get up.
Why didn't you buy more plasters?
How much money do we have left?
We still have a lot. Is that your savings?
I saved it to buy Grandpa's glassess. But it's okay. I can save it again.
By the way, I gave this inn's phone number to the man at the repair shop.
Jeez. Can you tie up her hair or something?
How am I going to bring her around when she looks so grungy?
Oh, her hair. Grandpa has all her hairbands.
He always does her hair for her.
Mister, I'm not going to cry.
I'm the bigger one, so I'm not supposed to cry.
Grandpa said so.
For Mal-sun and myself,
Grandpa is the most important person in the world.
His knees are aching and his eyes are bad.
Every time he goes to pick up bottles, people harass him.
But he said he feels happy because he could at least
put food on the table.
Can we go back home one more time?
He told us to wait at home, and that he'll be back.
-Maybe-- -Don't be rediculous.
There's...
Why didn't I think about that?
Dong-i, they couldn't find it,
because it wasn't there.
The secret book Kim Byeong-deok has been keeping.
"Gwangeunhoe."
Founded a long time ago as a religious organization,
it now has a strong influence on politics and the military.
A fanatic group that has power.
Nobody knows how much money has gone to Gwangeunhoe.
People who investigated it have gone missing or died mysteriously.
Gwangeunhwe is trying to gain more power from the upcoming election.
Because they need to shut down scandals and bring in more money.
Everyone's sold on this fear of war propaganda that's promoted by them.
If there's an event that turns that fear into reality,
then surely Gwangeunhoe will have a strong grip on this nation.
And the person who is trying to fabricate that event is Kang Seong-il.
But there is no evidence to prove that Gwangeunhoe exists.
That looks familar.
If I could only find documents written by them--
I asked you to send some money.
You...
Stop talking nonsense.
Tomorrow is the 24th. All of us here are working on this case.
Okay, Chief Hong.
I have to ask you something.
Why are you taking Kim Byeong-deok's kids around?
Have you gone mad? Please don't--
Dong-i. Mal-sun.
And the people of Myeongwol-ri.
The innocent people who are victims of a big lie.
They prepared guns that spies would use.
The higher-ups will go on vacation. All communication will be cut off.
At 9:00 p.m. on October 24th. All residents of Myeongwol-ri will be killed.
Kang Seong-il and Gwangeunhoe, who are trying to bring disaster.
And Kim Byeong-deok who killed my mother.
Every one of them,
including me, have the same mark.
Kim Byeong-deok knows everything.
I need to find him first.
What do we do now?
Why are you asking me that?
You promised to find my grandpa!
Are you getting mad at me?
We thought of a good idea.
How about we draw Grandpa's face?
-And put it up. -Put it up everywhere.
How did you come up with that?
I wish I could be carefree just like you.
Think about it. Dong-i, you said you get good grades. It's not like he's lost on the streets.
He's locked in somewhere. He's captured in a completely remote…
What? Wait a minute.
Dong-i, hand me your notes. Sure.
Jeez, I'm an idiot.
-This is Samhwa bookshop. -Is the inn owner there?
Oh, hi. He's here.
But just now, we got a call from Taegwang Repair.
It seemed urgent.
-The repair shop? -He said someone came. Forget that. Let me talk to the inn owner first.
He wants to talk to you.
-Yes, hello? -What is it that you saw?
-What? -The place where you took furniture from.
You saw their grandpa there, didn't you?
So it was him, wasn't it?
It was their grandpa!
I wasn't able to see inside clearly.
-But it looked like a person. -Is anyone here?
I was going to tell you about it,
but you were so busy.
I went there yesterday too.
I thought it was weird. Yes, I'm sure. I saw the grandpa there. I saw him twice.
-Where's that place? -Let me tell you.
You know, when you drive towards downtown--
Hello?
What is this? Hello?
"The telephone exchange offices will stop operating starting at 3:00 p.m. in two-hour intervals."
The repair shop.
Why is he looking for me?
A place with the shortest distance from the old man.
Mister, are you all right?
Let's stop by at the repair shop first.
We need to fix our car.
He escaped.
Why is it so difficult to reach you? Couldn't even find you at the police station.
Are you guys really working or not?
Why were you looking for me?
The old man's left eye is blind, right?
He was here. The kids' grandpa.
He came here?
He was looking for the kids and wanted to go home.
Don't know where he came from, but he was in bad shape. So I told him to rest here for now.
Don't tell the kids about this.
-Hello. -Hello.
So you know...
I mean...
Kang Seong-il.
Where's my gun?
We will all die if we run into him now.
Just talk to him casually, and try to act normal.
Oh, hi.
Is it done?
It's outside. You can take it and leave.
Leave?
Just leave?
Oh, it's 125,000 won.
I'll dock 5,000 won off for you. It'll be 120,000 won.
Mal-sun, you know where the car trunk is, right?
There's a bag with a gun inside. Take the gun and hurry back here.
Jeez, my legs.
Mal-sun, to the right.
Why did you close the door? It seems like someone's inside.
What? Who?
What are you--
What?
Didn't I tell you to do your homework first? There's no homework today.
She's not doing well in school.
Fine, I'll let you two meet.
I did well, didn't I?
Why did everyone come here? I was scared.
This is my workplace. Jeez.
Thank you.
For Mal-sun and myself, Grandpa is the most important person in the world.
Run, Gil-dong.
You must live. Live and take revenge.
Let me ask you one more favor.
I'll pay you back later.
Please take the kids to the bookstore.
All right.
I'm not doing this for money. It's because these kids are so adorable. Do you know how busy I am?
Dong-i. Mal-sun.
You said you trust me, right?
-Yes. -We trust you.
Don't ask anything and follow him. I'll join soon.
Who are you?
Is your name Kim Byeong-deok?
You had the book about Gwangeunhoe, right?
The secret book that can expose all of Gwangeunhoe's evil deeds.
At 9:00 p.m. tomorrow, the 24th.
They will gather all the people of Myeongwol-ri and kill them.
You knew about this and tried to run away with the book.
But you got caught and ended up like this.
Don't worry.
I'm here to help you.
Mister,
by any chance, was my grandpa at your place? Hold on.
Isn't that the man from earlier?
We have only one day left.
We really don't have much time.
Tell me.
But the thing is, my kids are--
I'll let you meet them.
But if you want me to help you,
you have to tell me right here, right now.
If you get out of here without a plan, you will get caught again.
About that incident, what you saw, heard, everything you know.
Tell me everything without one lie.
It all started there.
Those people
with false beliefs were living there together.
The leader of Gwangeunhoe.
For him, the people would do anything.
Once you're in, you couldn't dare to leave.
Those bastards even whipped a six-year-old kid
and broke his legs.
They seized people's hard-earned money.
All those with power took their bribes and overlooked their wrongdoings.
I used to be a clerk for my town.
I wrote in the book.
I wrote all the evil deeds they did with my own hand.
Trust me.
Those bastards are trying to kill innocent people again.
They still exist. In this world, there's nothing impossible for them.
Wait.
So the one you killed...
Have you killed
anyone?
I escaped once.
Hong Sang-jik,
the leader of Gwangeunhoe,
liked to rape women.
He didn't care whether it was an adult or a child.
I was afraid that my daughter would be one of his victims.
So I needed to run away.
A lady who was with me at that time
was also running away to protect her son.
But we were captured.
As an example,
one of us needed to die.
That's why I picked up the gun.
So you regret killing that lady, right?
You want to ask for forgiveness, correct?
No.
I would still do the same thing.
If I didn't do it, my daughter would have been killed.
For the sake of my daugther,
I'll kill ten or even twenty people.
-What? -You want me to apologize?
I don't regret it one bit.
I didn't do anything wrong. Those monsters did!
Say it again.
Say that you regret it.
Who are you?
Was that you?
-The son? -It's okay if you lie.
Say that you regret it.
Dong-i.
Mal-sun.
Mal-sun.
Where's the inn owner?
What are you doing here?
The old man is here, isn't he?
Mister.
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Oh no, Mal-sun.
Are you okay?
-Mister. -We're in here!
-Dong-i? Mal-sun? -Mister!
Dong-i! Mal-sun!
Mister!
Hold on. I'll get inside.
What should I do?
-Hello? -Oh, it's you.
Thank God you picked up the phone.
-I found the kids' grandpa. -Where are you?
What happened that the kids are also captured here?
-The kids? -Dong-i and Mal-sun are here too.
You have to hurry up and come here.
I don't know the address. You know the main road in front of my house.
Take a right there and you will see a cottage on the way.
And
if you go towards that direction...
Hey.
How do you feel after meeting him? Did the old man apologize to you?
Did you give it a proper thought?
Where the old man is
and who you really are.
Where could this be?
I'll be waiting for you.
Hello?
Honey. Hello?
What's going on? What did he say?
You must live. Live and take revenge.
Mom.
You're finally here, Hong Gil-dong.
-Where's the book? -The book?
What book?
Stop lying to me.
Do you remember?
I was bitten by a dog and you kicked it away for me when we were young.
Don't worry.
I don't plan on hurting you.
Okay. I don't want to fight either.
Is that true?
-Can I trust you? -Just trust me.
If I let you go now, can you bring it here?
I should've brought it here already.
I will, right away.
But first,
can you give the old man and the kids to me?
Of course. Do whatever you want.
But you can only take Kim out of here as a corpse.
Then I will trust you and let you guys go.
Didn't you look for Kim because you wanted to kill him?
Like your mother was killed. Just like what you witnessed.
What are you getting at?
Kim Byeong-deok and the kids are all here.
Do it here. There's one bullet in there.
Why?
Is this situation familiar to you?
Kill the old man and join us. The world will change.
I'm the only person who can understand you.
We'll be on your side.
Dong-i, close your eyes.
No!
I'll give it to you.
But the book is not with me. You searched me, didn't you?
Let me make one call. They'll bring it here.
Why are you being like this?
-I told you not to be like that. -Dong-i.
Didn't you sense anything strange all this time?
Why was I with you guys?
Why was I looking for your grandpa?
Why would an emloyee at the Registration Department do that?
Does that make any sense?
Why are you so stupid and follow me around?
I'll tell you
the truth.
Shut up, old man.
I came here to kill your grandpa.
To kill him in front of you and your sister.
A long time ago, your grandpa did the same to me.
And you two are no different.
I was so disgusted to see you and your sister's dirty faces.
Do you know how hard it was to suppress my anger every time?
Friends?
Friends, my ass.
You disgusting
blood of my enemy.
Kim Byeong-deok will die by my hands.
However,
not this way.
He can't die like this.
Let me make a call.
They'll bring it here.
What I said doesn't matter.
People don't listen to my words carefully anyways.
I need to trust myself first.
Make a call, then someone will bring the book here...
On second thought, the phone can't connect now!
Grandpa!
Go first.
I'll get Dong-i and Mal-sun out of here.
Go, and don't let me
ever see you again.
Dong-i. Forget what I just said.
They were all lies.
Don't you know me?
My words are all lies.
Let's get out of here together. Your grandpa is outside.
Trust me one last time.
Dong-i.
Mal-sun.
-Dong-i. -Damn it.
Wait for me here.
-Dong-i. -I told him to get out. What's he doing?
Mal-sun.
Grandpa!
Dong-i.
No!
You disappointed me.
Grandpa.
Where's Mal-sun?
Grandpa.
Mal-sun?
Mal-sun?
Mal-sun?
Mal-sun!
Mal-sun!
Grandpa.
Grandpa, wake up.
Kang Seong-il.
Mal-sun!
Hi. This is Kim Mal-sun.
I'm sorry.
You're not sleeping well and you're hurt.
You want to help us find Grandpa.
But I'm not being of much help.
I wish you were our uncle.
But being friends is great too.
Yours, Kim Mal-sun.
Hey, what is Mal-sun talking about?
Dong-i.
Grandpa.
Have you eaten?
I have.
Where's Mal-sun?
She's tired so she's sleeping.
Dong-i.
From now on,
you need to pack up
her school supplies for her.
My sweeties. I'm sorry that I couldn't buy you delicious meals.
Dong-i. Mal-sun.
I'm sorry
for making you suffer because of me.
I'm sorry
for everything.
Did he pass away?
I should've told him
that we had sweet and sour pork
and that everything's fine.
But he died.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
Today's the 24th. Tonight's the night.
Where should I go?
Come to Jeongwon-ri dock tonight at 8:30 p.m.
Don't be late.
The current time is 8 p.m.
All residents of Myeongwol-ri must gather
at the village lot.
I repeat.
All residents of Myeongwol-ri must gather
at the village lot.
Attendance is mandatory.
Jeez.
My gosh.
I'll give you the book after you send them out.
Why did you come back? You should've escaped when you had the chance.
What are you doing?
One minute left.
"One minute"?
Wasn't it at 9:00 p.m.?
What the hell are you doing?
We could talk this over.
Hold on.
Calm down.
Listen to me one last time.
Mal-sun.
It's over.
He said it's over.
All the people of Myeongwol-ri, and the little kid, are dead.
Mal-sun.
Gil-dong.
In this world, there are people who are important and those who are not.
It's okay to get rid of the unimportant ones. Like those we just killed.
Help me. I'm sorry.
I really hoped you'll join us.
Father has been worried about you.
He said you would grow up to become dangerous.
-What? -What is this?
What's happening?
What is it?
Is something wrong?
The governor, the chief, and the security manager.  Long time no see, right?
So, what really happened here?
And now you want me to pay double to buy them again? It'll be difficult to even contact them.
Do it correctly or you will die.
We don't have time to take all them out. Are we sweatshop workers?
Gunpowder? There shouldn't be any left. Because we took them all out.
You guys went nuts with the guns the day you got them, right?
You guys used up all the real bullets that night.
Where were your minds at?
The men you teamed up with were laying low until they got caught.
We found them all. Should we catch them? Of course. Why do you even ask? Bring them in.
Then what were the gun shots that you heard at 8:30 p.m.?
You finally understand what happened, don't you?
Kang Seong-il.
Ever since the day after we met, you were fighting a losing battle.
Although things weren't going as planned with Kim Byeong-deok.
The real residents of Myeongwol-ri left their homes two hours ago.
They're watching a movie right now. Just like what you did at your village.
A movie with lots of gunfire to cover up all the noises.
You're right. There are people who should not exist.
People like you who solely rely on your power and do whatever you want.
My job is to destroy people like you.
Even though I'm not a good guy myself.
It's done.
Is anyone there?
Someone answer me!
Yes, what's up?
Take your guns out if you want to live a little longer.
Starting now, you'll see what real hell is like.
Now, let's wrap this up, shall we?
How dare you
go against Hong Gil-dong.
I'm giving you guys one more chance. Go and tell them the truth.
-Okay. -Okay.
If you make trouble or lie again, we will find you.
Next time, it won't be settled with guns.
A real clan of trash.
Kang Seong-il.
The second son of Chief Hong, the leader of Gwangeunhoe.
You used to be a soft and good-hearted brother.
You changed your name
and turned into a monster.
Don't assume that you have won.
This is not the end of us.
Father
will find you now.
He won't be able to catch me.
Because I'm someone who doesn't exist in this world.
Seong-il.
I don't even have an ID.
Mal-sun.
Mal-sun, wake up now.
Mister.
Let's go to your sister.
OCTOBER 25TH
The next day, life went on as usual.
At their work place
with the same look and attitude.
The families and friends who've been struck with tragedy were contacted and told a convincing, made-up story.
They believed our story as they grieved deeply.
Nobody knows what really happened in this village.
"Controversy stirs up around Gwangeunhoe secret book.
The secret organization unveiled.
Government officials deny allegations of involvement."
The secret book put a lot of people in a tough spot.
And the death of Kim put Dong-i in a tough spot as well.
Dong-i. Where's Grandpa?
Grandpa went somewhere. He went to earn money.
If you eat well
and listen to your teacher,
he said he'll come back soon.
-Let's go. -Okay.
Grandpa.
Dong-i.
Are you not going to talk to me anymore?
My grandpa
didn't sleep well just like you
because he always dreamt of his wrongdoings in the past.
Mal-sun.
Yes?
Have I told you about my mom?
No.
She also
left me to earn money.
I didn't like seaweed
so I wouldn't eat
when she made seaweed soup.
My mom would take out all the seaweed
so that I could eat the soup with rice.
And...
my mom
would also
smell like paper.
Did your mom ever come back?
Yes.
-Seriously? -Of course.
You're not lying again, are you?
It's true.
Stop talking nonsense, will you?
Are we almost there? Where are we?
Is it true that we'll never meet again after this?
It seems so.
What if I miss you?
If that happens, just remember me.
We'll never forget you.
We won't forget you no matter what.
Mister!
What?
I saved these for you.
Here.
-Here. -I'm okay.
Dong-i, friends are supposed to share.
Didn't you know that?
Thank you, Mister.
I don't have nightmares anymore.
Because now I know
who I really am and who my enemies are.
The monsters that birthed me...
Go! Go!
Fuck!
Got you! There's nowhere to run!
MAN: Welcome, everybody, to tonight's weighing in!
First up onto the scales, we have Wes "The Jailor" Baylor!
One-seventy! -[cheering] -Whoo!
We cannot forget his opponent, for he cannot fight this fight alone in the ring.
Here we go, baby.
Here we go, baby. -We have Jonny -I'm proud of you. "Solid Gold" Sutherland!
One-sixty-eight!
I'll see you in the ring, motherfucker.
Get ready 'cause I'm not playing.
And we'll see you tomorrow night!
MAN: What a night. I've been waiting for this night. Tension is so high.
Baylor is out to get Sutherland. Sutherland is out to get Baylor.
It's just a matter of who wants it more. That's it.
CORNERMAN: Come on. Use that jab.
ANNOUNCER: Oh, Sutherland gives a couple of kicks.
Baylor comes back.
He punches, he kicks!
This is crazy. Oh, yeah, this is starting--
this is starting faster than I thought it would.
...with a lift, and Baylor's on the floor!
Baylor's on the floor.
CORNERMAN: Sink it, sink it, man!
-Baylor gets Sutherland -[dinging] in a headlock.
-And the first round is over. -Go back to your corners.
ANNOUNCER: That was charged with energy, folks. That was insane. That was crazy.
That was insane. That was crazy.
Here's some water. Come on.
SPECTATOR: You're my one, girl! ANNOUNCER: All right, folks, round two.
ANNOUNCER: All right, folks, round two. [bell dinging] REFEREE: Fight!
COACH: Move!
Get in his head. Move!
Get in his head. Move! -Come on. Turn him! -Come on. Move!
-Come on. Turn him! -Come on. Move!
ANNOUNCER: He's struggling out of it.
And Baylor frees himself, punches, just missed Sutherland.
Look at these longtime sparring partners go at each other.
ANNOUNCER: Oh, my God! A roundhouse to Baylor's face!
-Back it up. -Give him some room.
Get up.
In your corner.
SPECTATOR: Yeah, baby!
Don't know about the first, but you definitely lost the second.
You can't leave it up to the judges, okay?
Remember that, and keep the jab. Keep the jab always.
Get out there and do your bloody business.
Just tell me what I gotta do!
You gotta knock him out. Take his head off.
You gotta knock him out. Take his head off. Now, get in there! Come on! Pull it together!
Now, get in there! Come on! Pull it together!
Go! [bell dinging]
MAN: Come on, Wes!
CORNERMAN: Hands up!
CORNERMAN: Finish him, Wes! Finish him!
Put him away, Wes. Put him away.
ANNOUNCER: And Sutherland is down!
Oh, my God! And Sutherland is down! [echoing]
ANNOUNCER: Oh, my God. He's still down.
Sutherland is still down.
He's not even moving. Oh, my God.
He's not even moving. Oh, my God. Somebody help Sutherland. Somebody go up--
Wes, help him!
Jonny! [echoing]
No!
Jonny! [echoing]
No matter how this turns out, win or lose,
No matter how this turns out, win or lose, you're family, all right?
JONNY'S VOICE: You're always gonna be welcome out at the beach house.
WES: What beach house?
The one I'm gonna buy from kicking your ass. with the money I get
-What if I kick your ass? -Then you can buy me the beach house.
JONNY'S VOICE: This is to remind you of all the time we spent training for this,
and how it paid off.
Jonny.
WOMAN'S VOICE: I don't know how best friends can do this to each other.
WES'S VOICE: Kay, don't worry about it.
We kick the shit out of each other in the gym on a daily basis.
We kick the shit out of each other in the gym on a daily basis. The difference here? We're gonna get paid for it.
The difference here? We're gonna get paid for it. KAY'S VOICE: Wes? Jonny didn't make it. He's dead.
KAY'S VOICE: Wes? Jonny didn't make it. He's dead.
Are you guys ready? CROWD: Yeah!
I said, "Are you guys ready?"
Yeah! Fight!
Hey. Good to see you. Having a good night?
Hey, good to see you. Welcome.
-I should put you in that fight. -[man laughs]
-You just won me -Already got paid. three thousand bucks.
MAN [chuckles]: Not enough for this shit.
I'm Jonah. Aldrich.
Come from a family of fight promoters.
-I'm not on the MMA circuit. -Never heard of you.
-I'm not on the MMA circuit. -Never heard of you. Then neither are you these days.
Look. [clears throat]
For what it's worth, I think it sucks how they treated you.
After Sutherland, you deserved a title shot.
Wasn't your fault what happened, yet here you are,
risking your neck for chump change.
It's just not right.
Listen, uh, Mr.--
Aldrich.  Aldrich.
I didn't get the shit kicked out of me by Bruce Lee over there
so that you could bullshit me to death.
-What do you want? -I want to give you a second chance.
-You want to give me -Yeah, I do. [laughs] a second chance?
I'm putting together something special.
A one-off fight in Myanmar.
Winner takes home half a million.
[chuckles] Not interested.
[laughing] Really?
And how long is it before some lunatic comes along and just caves your head in?
And how long is it before some lunatic comes along and just caves your head in? For what? A hundred bucks and a shot of tequila.
For what? A hundred bucks and a shot of tequila.
Actually, it's 400, [clicks tongue] and two shots of tequila.
One fight.
One last payday, and you're set for life.
Madden, give Mr. Baylor our particulars.
JONNY'S VOICE: You're always gonna be welcome out at the beach house.
WES'S VOICE: What beach house?
The one I'm gonna buy from kicking your ass. with the money I get
-What if I kick your ass? -Then you can buy me the beach house.
Best view in Bangkok. Have a seat.
You hungry?
So, are you a fight promoter or a chef?
Sushi requires precision.
It helps me to focus, which helps me to relax.
Are you calm and focused, Mr. Baylor?
Because, given your history,
Because, given your history, killing your best friend would destroy most men.
Bury them in guilt and regret.
Man might even try to get himself killed in the ring
Man might even try to get himself killed in the ring as some sort of sad, pathetic penance.
You that kind of a man, Mr. Baylor?
I want one million.
No bullshit gate percentages, no win bonuses
and I want the cash up front.
You like to win, Mr. Baylor?
WES: Sure. Don't you?
Abso-fucking-lutely.
Welcome to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, Mr. Baylor.
General.
[chuckles] Good to see you.
The Republic of the Union of Myanmar gratefully accepts your donations.
No words. We're just here to help the people.
[chuckles] Come and meet the gang.
Señor Esparto, Spain's most celebrated bullfighter.
Killed as much meat as a slaughterhouse.
It will be an honor to see you in the arena, Mr. Baylor.
-The Zimlings -Hmm. from Texas.
Jacob and his son, Tobias.
Here for some father-son bonding.
You're lucky, kid. My dad only took me to Chuck E. Cheese.
Holy shit!
You're Wes Baylor. "The Executioner."
Sorry, my ring name was "The Jailor."
[laughs] Not after that last fight.
My boy and I were there. Fuckin' A, let me shake your hand.
[laughing] We're big fans.
Like I promised, Mr. Zimling. Only the best.
Miss Sofia, heir to the third-richest oil baron in the world,
taking Daddy's lifelong hobby of big game hunting to the next level.
Bit of a sore subject.
They tell me you like punishment.
Sorry, ma'am. You're not my type.
That's bullshit.
I'm everyone's type.
Landon Marshall.
You probably recognize the face from Wired magazine.
They called me the Mark Zuckerberg of the first-person shooter.
I've never heard of you.
ALDRICH: Where's Maduka? Never heard of you either, bro.
ALDRICH: Where's Maduka? Never heard of you either, bro. -Probably sleeping off  -Very well. Let's begin. last night.
-Probably sleeping off  -Very well. Let's begin. last night.
Begin what? What exactly is, uh, going on here?
Where's the ring?
Where's, uh-- Where's the opponent?
Where's, uh-- Where's the opponent? Your opponents you've met,
and the ring, well, you're standing in it.
A hundred square miles of jungle.
The purse?
A million dollars' worth of rubies.
You get across the border, they're yours.
Thailand's that way, [zipper unzipping] due east.
What is this? Some sort of a joke?
Is there a hidden camera around here, or--
You signed up for a no-holds-barred contest,
You signed up for a no-holds-barred contest, and that's what you're going to get.
That's what you're all going to get.
Time to find out where you are on the food chain.
Choose your weapon.
JACOB: Hey! [laughs]
I recommend the crossbow, for the real hunter.
ALDRICH: And don't worry. Hey. [chuckles]
Change your mind later, there'll be plenty of time. They'll be following us.
ALDRICH: It's all yours.
MADDEN: Yes, sir.
A little demonstration of what lies ahead.
That is just a start.
ALDRICH: You're facing the ultimate challenge.
Hunting... your equal on the evolutionary scale.
You rise to this challenge,
you'll reach the pinnacle of satisfaction as a hunter.
Can I get a "fuck yeah"?
HUNTERS: Fuck yeah! [cackles]
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Baylor. No weapon for you.
Madden's right.
But I will give you this.
A two-minute head start. [beeps]
And...
a water bottle.
when you can. Fill it [gasps]
What the hell is wrong with you people?
This isn't a fight. That's murder.
MADDEN: No, it's a hunt.
It's fucking insane.
Ninety seconds.
This is bullshit, Aldrich. I didn't sign up for this shit.
Find yourself another piece of meat. I'm outta here.
ALDRICH: You're right about that.
One way or the other, you are outta here. It's up to you to choose.
Course there is. Not a lot of choice here.
You can win...
or you can lose.
Oh. Seventy seconds.
What's the matter? You need me to ring the bell?
Ding, ding.
This will be a good hunt.
Mr. Maduka. So glad you could make it.
Mr. Maduka. So glad you could make it. Chief Lord Maduka.
ALDRICH: My apologies.
Chief Lord.
But... cameras, cell phones, any recording devices.
MADDEN: You know the rules.
[sighs] No calls? Just a few snaps? Take a mental picture, Mr. Marshall.
You're about to join a very exclusive club.
We don't just share this with anyone.
Besides, what you're about to experience can't be captured on camera.
You're gonna let it live in here forever.
Jesus, ladies. SOFIA: [chuckles]
JACOB: Let's go. You wanna fuck or hunt?
ALDRICH: Get him!
Damn. You are in great shape.
You cross-fit? [panting] Spinning?
Krav Maga? That's my jam.
Excuse me while I get my heart rate up. [grunts]
ESPARTO: Bueno. Ay. [panting] getting to you, kid? The pressure
Why don't you shut the fuck up, old man.
Hundred miles due east, huh?
Fuck you, Aldrich. North border's only 40.
ALDRICH: He's run flat out for a mile, knows we're right behind him.
Probably doesn't like his chances out in the open.
Try to get in his head.
[chuckles] Clever lad.
Maduka. Who's missing? MADDEN:
Shit.
Fuck!
Get up! Oh, no! Please stop! No! Please, please!
Please stop! No! Please, please!
Seriously?
Do you like my little toy, huh?
I make it special for monkeys like you. [grunts]
When we step into the arena,
we don't always step out.
Not so noble now, Chief Lord.
[retches] hard targets for a reason. ALDRICH: They're called
Jesus.
For the first time you're hunting something as smart as you are.
[chuckles] Doubt that. ALDRICH: Baylor won't be an easy kill.
As it should be.
Lady and gentlemen, all bets are off.
From now on, watch your backs.
And I guarantee one of you will be wearing his balls for breakfast by sundown.
Wipe your goddamn mouth.
This way.
Stay alert. He's close.
Shit!
ALDRICH: Target's in sight!
ALDRICH: We have the high ground!
ALDRICH: Man has hunted every species on the planet.
What makes you better than him, huh?
ALDRICH: It is time to find out!
JACOB: Fuck this bow-and-arrow shit!
Like shootin' fish in a barrel, Baylor!
Try this.
Oh! Now you're talkin'.
It's Christmas!
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Fuck.
You want to fight these elephants?
He threw the first punch.
You fell in their bath and scared them.
I saw the whole thing.
You working for Aldrich?
Who's Aldrich?
[panting] Forget about it.
Shit!
You see a watch around here anywhere?
Here you go.
Thanks.
What are you doing out here?
Some people are hunting me.
My brother was being hunted too. Win.
Have you seen him?
No.
I'm sorry.
I have to get to the border.
The border's not that way.
Just follow me.
JACOB: Baylor is good. I'll give him that.
JACOB: Baylor is good. I'll give him that. TOBIAS: Yeah. Maybe too good.
TOBIAS: Yeah. Maybe too good.
LANDON: Hey, perhaps we can take a short break. Huh?
SOFIA: Fuck that. I'll kill him myself.
ALDRICH: I realize you didn't pay good money to run a jungle 5K.
ALDRICH: You're here to hunt.
But even good hunters need their trusted steeds!
JACOB [laughing]: Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Now you're talkin'.
Come on. [Jacob laughs]
How do you know where we're going?
Everything looks the same to me.
My brother and I grew up here.
That's how we got involved in all of this.
Got involved in what?
They told him he was doing a drug run.
Then he disappeared.
When someone in our village disappears, we know they're being used in a game.
WOMAN: So how are you here?
I'm a fighter.
They told me there was gonna be a fight.
Fight turned out to be a hunt.
My brother's a good fighter too.
He fights for me and our village.
Well, the best fighters
always have something to fight for.
What is your something?
I love it when they take the temple route.
-MADDEN: Where did he -ALDRICH: I don't know. pick up the girl?
Let's see if we can charge extra for her.
ALDRICH: Tell the gang there's another target.
Which way now?
Through the old temple grounds, over there.
Then follow the train tracks and the river for a long time
-before we reach the border. -Okay.
Train tracks, river, all the way to the border.
Thank you. Sorry, I-- I didn't get your name.
-Tha, I'm Wes. -Tha.
All right, cool. Thank you.
Thank you very much for your help and good luck finding your brother.
I'm gonna make my own way now.
Tha, listen. Your life is gonna be a lot safer without me in it. Trust me.
I'll lead them away. Hide!
I saw the girl. We'll have to go on foot to get her.
Hey. I love this. [chuckles]
You think it's a good idea to leave the bike?
Sh-Shit. Dad!
I can smell her. [laughing]
[grunts] What are you doing? I saw someone.
There's no one there. -[panting] Yeah. -You fuckin' clown.
-[panting] Yeah. -You fuckin' clown.
Ow. You think I'm crazy? -I hate the fucking jungle. -She's up ahead.
-I hate the fucking jungle. -She's up ahead.
Little bitch.
Won't be needin' that anymore.
You like the rough stuff, do ya? So do I.
Trouble is, you can never get enough of it.
I don't want anything to do with this.
-[Tha gasping] -Tobias. Tobias! Where the hell are you going?
Tobias! Where the hell are you going?
Get back here, you pussy! Tobias!
JACOB: Tobias! [Tha grunts]
-[Tha shrieks] -Tobias!
What the hell is wrong with you, lady?
There are infinite privileges
and side effects to being the only child of one of the greatest assholes
in the history of big game hunting.
All the time and resources to train your mind and body for combat.
I just hope that the day might come where I get to hunt the hunter.
So that's what this is about. Daddy issues, huh?
Why don't you just get yourself a sparring partner?
[spits] Because it doesn't count unless the hunt is real.
Is that real enough for ya?
Not good. Fuck!
Not good, not good. Not good.
Tha!
-[shouting] -Tha!
-[panting] -Tha!
He's dead.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.
Karma's a bitch.
[panting] Cover him.
This is not good for business.
ESPARTO: He's awake. He's awake.
ESPARTO: He's awake. He's awake. TOBIAS: Oh, no.
-What happened? -I don't know.
The woman. She did this.
You let a girl do this to your father?
-How could you, huh? -[grunts]
Your father spent a small fortune so you could grow some balls, and that's what you're gonna do, right here, right now.
so you could grow some balls, and that's what you're gonna do, right here, right now.
-You want to kill these people. -No, I don't want to kill anyone.
-I want to kill them. -Say it.
-I want to kill them. -Say it. -Louder. Louder! -I want to kill--
-Louder. Louder! -I want to kill--
-I want to kill them! -Like you mean it!
I want to kill them.
That's good.
Hey, uh, maybe-- maybe we should head back, huh?
SOFIA: That's right.
Why don't you run home to Mommy.
We came here chasing death.
We should not be surprised if we find it.
You're wrong, sir.
We did not come here to chase death.
We came to deal it.
We gotta keep moving.
I didn't want to kill him.
You didn't have a choice.
No. We always have a choice.
Look. You got two choices, all right?
Either you fight,
or you stay here and you die.
What's it gonna be?
Good choice. Aaah! [winces]
You're hurt.
-Yeah, with what? Let's go. -That needs to be treated.
I know a place.
Ah, shit.
Show me your wound.
What are you going to do with your money?
I'm gonna buy a big house by the sea.
-I'm trying to buy a -Yeah? whole village.
Did everybody leave?
The soldiers told us they needed the land.
But one of the soldiers was from a nearby village.
Told us that hunters had paid the general to clear out this entire area.
So they moved us to a border town. It's awful there.
No way to make offerings to the forest spirit.
So she's become very hungry.
And very angry.
Now that Y'wa is fed, we will suffer no more.
She'll return my brother and village to me.
Come.
Show some respect.
ALDRICH: You got a position yet?
Two clicks over that ridge.
-Good. Get the kids. -Team!
Okay, great. So, what, we follow the road now?
No, we go through this field. See?
Down the river, and further down is the bridge to the border.
Come on. Let's go.
-What's that smell? -What?
Smells like gasoline.
Land mines.
-What? -Don't move!
WES: Shit.
Grab a drink if you need one.
Get down. They're here already?
Get back there.
Come on.
That's right. Come on in, you bastards.
There!
Ah, here we go.
Stop! Everybody freeze!
You've cornered your prey.
He's in a minefield, stuck, nowhere to go.
Checkmate.
All that remains is target practice. Break out the M16s.
-No, no, no! Tobias, wait! -Die, motherfucker!
[gunfire] Wait!
Fuck!
Goddamn it! Somebody kill this prick!
Do you wanna die?
Get out of here. Leave me alone. Run.
Pretty soon, they're gonna find me, all right?
And when they do, you shouldn't be here.
Now go!
I'm not leaving.
I know a good hiding place.
Did you hear that? [coughing] THA: Wait.
-Someone else is here. -[groaning]
[groans] THA: Win?
-Win! [laughs] -Tha. Tha.
Who are you?
-What are you doing with him? -It's okay.
-He's one of them! -Take it easy, man. Take it easy.
I'm not one of them. I'm in the same position you are.
I'm not one of them. I'm in the same position you are. It's okay. Trust me. We-- We can trust him.
It's okay. Trust me. We-- We can trust him.
Okay?
Those guys are hunting me as well.
Just trust me. It's okay.
It's okay.
MADDEN: This way.
Tracks lead down here.
What's wrong?
-I've lost the tracks. -I lost the signal.
Fuck.
I'll handle this.
Let's make camp here, everyone.
Why do you care so much about that watch?
A friend gave it to me.
Reminds me of something.
Something good?
Not really.
Here. Let me take a look.
Tomorrow, we cross the border.
Then what?
Then I'll leave you.
That's what you want, right?
You should get some sleep.
Good night, Tha.
Kind of burnt.
SOFIA: What is this, fucking summer camp?
So, Aldrich,
how'd you get into this business, if you don't mind me asking?
CIA didn't have, uh, much appreciation for my talents.
Said I was too theatrical.
Can you believe that?
-[chuckles] -[chuckles] So I came up with my own business.
Hunting with a twist.
Turned into international success.
The general was escorting rebels in the Yangon prison.
I suggest he help us hunt.
And he bites.
I mean,
prisoners are gonna die anyway, right?
So why not have some fun?
They let them loose in the jungle. We acted as trackers, grew the business from there.
We acted as trackers, grew the business from there.
So the money's good?
MADDEN: Yeah.
Killing's better.
Didn't get your fill in the military, huh?
I was never in the service.
Didn't make the psych evaluation.
I was too crazy. Pussies thought
Well, they weren't wrong.
No. No, no.
No. Jonny.
[panting] Jonny! No!
Wes! Jonny!
-[grunts] -Be quiet.
Who's Jonny?
Jonny was my best friend.
We were both in line for a shot at the title.
They wanted us to fight each other.
Offered us more money than we'd ever known, so...
we did.
I wanted to win.
And I didn't wanna leave it in the hands of the judges, so...
I went for the knockout.
I hit him so hard, he never woke up.
It was an accident.
You didn't mean for it to happen.
But it still happened.
Tha?
Oh, shit.
ALDRICH: Nice to see you again, Win.
How appropriate we caught you both at this particular place.
The Japanese killed nearly a hundred thousand workers building this railroad.
Starvation.
Exhaustion.
Dysentery.
Plenty of them got beaten to death.
Where's Wes Baylor?
I killed him. For the rubies.
ALDRICH: You killed him?
-[groans] -No, he was asleep.
I don't buy it.
THA [in distance]: Please!
Please. ALDRICH: Again.
THA: No!
Please!
Help!
Shut up. Shut up.
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm just a shitty video game designer. Please don't kill me.
ALDRICH [on recording]: The Japanese killed nearly a hundred thousand workers
building this railroad.
Starvation.
Exhaustion.
-Move. -Yeah.
I saw a Burmese soldier do this.
Just a length of bamboo.
Took him only four shots to get clean through the neck.
I don't think you'll last two. THA: Don't! Stop!
Don't do it! [panting]
-Stop it! -Where's Baylor?
THA: Please! -Stop it! -Where's Baylor?
-Stop it! -Where's Baylor? No! Please!
WES: Aldrich!
Let 'em go.
ALDRICH: What do you care about them? They took your payday.
-Yeah, I'm taking it back. -[rifle cocks] Cut 'em loose.
Cut 'em loose and back up, or I'll blow his fuckin' head off!
Let me take him. ALDRICH: No. You might kill Marshall.
ALDRICH: No. You might kill Marshall. So what?
It's bad enough for business losing clients to Baylor.
It'd be a fucking catastrophe if we start shooting them ourselves.
Cut 'em loose.
Give her the rubies.
-Wes. -Save it.
Get behind me.
ALDRICH: Now what, Baylor?
Got you backed into a corner. You got nowhere to go.
Come on, dude. Game over. Please, just let me go.
-You and Win, run. Go. -No.
I'll hold 'em off, and then-- then I'll jump.
THA: All right. WES: Go.
Move.
SOFIA: Where's Baylor?
-I got this. -Sorry.
Meet me at the river.
I will never tell you.
Oh, I think you will.
WIN: Wes, over here!
Win!
Not good.
This guy is-- [chuckles]
THA: Sorry about before.
Don't do that again. It's crazy.
The rubies.
I found Sofia.
Coño. Fuck.
At least we know where they're going.
ALDRICH: They're called hard targets for a reason.
First time you're hunting something as smart as you are.
Baylor won't be a--
I don't blame you for being angry.
When I save your ass, you rob me blind?
-We had no choice. -Oh, we always have a choice.
The rubies aren't for me. They're for my village.
If I pay the general, he'll let us return home.
They'll stop hunting us.
That's why I took the rubies.
How am I supposed to know you're telling the truth?
-You can't. -[chuckles]
But you can choose to.
You get me to the border, we'll call it quits.
LANDON: Look, man, I'm not even a hunter. I'm a gamer.
Just give me back my phone.
have someone pick me up. I'll call my assistant,
[clears throat] The memory card's missing.
Where did this come from?
I have no idea. It must be that woman or something.
Really?
A poor villager in bamboo flip-flops can afford a thousand-dollar Minicam?
I told you, Mr. Marshall, no phones, no cameras,
-no recording devices. -Yeah.
-We cleared that up, remember? -Hmm.
Like you said, I'm gonna carry it here, in my heart, and my heart is full of the--
-I didn't film anything. -What did you film?
No! Stop! Okay, look.
Okay, look. It was a few POV shots. First-person shooter stuff.
Of us?
You filmed us?
I was stuck on my new game.
The pressure to deliver is fucking insane.
And the critics? Man, 13-year-olds are harsh.
I just-- I needed some new inspiration.
Look, I know I screwed up. I'm really sorry.
Do you understand the concept of a verbal contract?
-We can get that card back. -[chuckles] You guys are badasses.
It's-- It's binding.
And actionable.
Congratulations, Señor Esparto.
You're our last hunter.
Let's bag that target. Signal's back.
Let's see where they are.
They're almost at the border.
Wait. You had this all along?
You're tracking with this?
[speaking Spanish] You have no honor.
Oh, give me a break.
Trying to contain a situation, you dumb, spic bastard.
Easy, amigo.
Back off.
Did something get lost in translation?
Mr. Marshall brought in a recording device.
Baylor's got the footage-- footage that might not sit too well
Baylor's got the footage-- footage that might not sit too well with your fans back home or Interpol.
So do you want honor, or do you want Baylor?
Nobody calls me a spic.
I'm a dago.
Hasta la muerte.
We can't let Baylor get to the border.
Call in the cleanup crew.
-You think we need them? -Call them!
Shit. We can't pass here. Follow me.
Shit. We can't pass here. Follow me. Ready? Come on.
[vehicle approaching] Stay low.
How the hell did they find us again?
Wait a minute.
They lost us when we went into that cave, right?
And they found you two when you went outside...
with the rubies.
We never even had a chance then.
We don't.
But you do.
I'm gonna hang on to this.
ALDRICH: GPS says he's around here somewhere.
You two get to the border.
-You make him pay. -Why would you do this for us?
I guess I finally found what I'm fighting for.
Go.
Go on.
They've got to be here.
What the fuck? Get him!
ALDRICH: Stop him! He cannot reach the border!
ALDRICH: Stop him! He cannot reach the border! No, no, no, no. I got you.
Take him out right now. You hear what I'm saying?
General wants to talk to you.
-[shouts in Burmese] -[men shouting]
-Guess you want me -No. Something better. to call for a boat.
I see you, yes. I'm coming for you.
I can see the look in your eyes.
You remind me of a famous Navarre bull-- Murciélago.
He survived 24 strikes of my lance.
Come on.
Come on!
Win!
Still on the move.
Keep on your right.
Bring it around again!
He fought with such spirit
that the crowd called for his life to be spared.
But sadly for you-- -[groans] -there is no crowd here today.
-Vayas con Dios. -THA: No!
He's almost at the border. I don't think we can get him in time.
It's a long walk to the other side. Anything can happen.
Let the troops know.
Stop him from getting to the Thai side.
I ain't no bull.
-[groans] -You son of a bitch.
Wes.
Keep him on the right.
On the right. Don't lose his ass.
Get us on that bridge.
Fuck you, Aldrich. I win.
Baylor!
Wrong side of the bridge. Tough break.
Guess you'll have to come through me.
We'd like to invite you to join us for a party in your honor.
No regrets, please.
Shit.
This was meant for you.
Come on.
Come on.
Aldrich! Let him go!
And if I don't? They're called hard targets for a reason.
You know what? You look great in HD, Aldrich.
Really captures what a prick you are.
You have something that belongs to me.
False sense of superiority?
Memory card. Where is it?
Oh, that.
Yeah, it's safe.
It's up my ass.
Well, let me help you extract it.
I know you're not that bright, Madden, but, uh, you do realize that wasn't my ass.
but, uh, you do realize that wasn't my ass.
I'm not the man you insult.
I just can't tell what kind of man you are, Baylor.
[chuckles] So I've been crawling, rattling around in my brain,
and then I suddenly realized you are just a nobody.
You're just some savage animal.
I mean, what you did to your best friend, leaving a son without his father,
his wife a widow.
If it was up to me, I'd go out of my mind. I would just die.
If it was up to me, I'd go out of my mind. I would just die. I wouldn't be able to--
Stop. Stop. That's what he wants. That's exactly what he wants.
Death's just not enough for you, is it?
You want to go out like your friend, like a warrior.
and I'll be happy to oblige. Just give me what I want, [spits]
No more shame. No more guilt.
Unless, of course, you don't have the card.
You gave it to the girl.
Then I'll hunt her down.
But first, you know what?
I think I deserve a little entertainment.
Did you bring the beer?
You know, Baylor,
I am gonna enjoy watching you get your ass kicked.
Thanks.
So I brought five friends.
Let's see how they rip you apart with their bare hands.
One, two, three, four guys and, uh, a little girl?
Not you. Not yet.
You know, you were right about me, Aldrich.
I was a nobody.
No shot at redemption.
Not until you came along.
Hell, son, you're welcome.
Praise Jesus. You're saved.
Fighting spirit's back, huh?
You gave me something to fight for.
Now.
What do you say, Baylor?
Don't pussy out on me now.
Not bad, Baylor. I thought you wouldn't have anything left.
Goddamn, Baylor. You're the man.
It's a shame to have to put you down.
Wes!
Don't do it!
You know how this works, Aldrich.
You get a two-minute head start. Get up.
Get up!
Ninety seconds.
Sixty seconds!
You're gonna have to kill me, Baylor.
'Cause I have friends. [man grunts]
Rich, powerful friends.
You think you can hunt me?
Who the hell do you think you are?
You lose.
General.
Kill that asshole.
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
General. I have the money.
Lower your weapons!
What did you just say? ALDRICH: General.
-It's okay. -General.
General, you dirty motherfucker!
Shoot!
Thank you.
So, you paid the general?
Yes.
Thanks to you, he's letting us get back our lives
and return to our village.
As long as we help him look for the missing rubies.
What missing rubies?
The ones you lost in the jungle.
Oh, you only gave him half?
You're a good man, Wes.
Get that house by the sea.
KAY'S VOICE: I hope you don't blame yourself for what happened.
Fighters fight.
What's important is finding something to fight for.
You asked for my forgiveness,
but I'm afraid I can't give it to you because there is nothing to forgive.
Thank you for what you've done for us.
Love, Kay.
P.S. We're still gonna keep the beach house though.
WES: As I said before, pushing off the back leg,
WES: As I said before, pushing off the back leg, twisting, kicking with the shin.
Twist all the way around.
So remember to twist that hip all the way to the front.
Twist the hip.
I guess it's break time, guys.
The boss says it's break time.
The trunk is red. The car is black. Lid of the trunk is red.
[mechanic] Yeah, so?
So, I said "nondescript," you know? It's got a red trunk.
-"Nondescript"? -Yeah, as in non-recognizable,
as in not a black fucking car with a red fucking trunk.
[mechanic] This is what they paid for.
-Shocks good? -[mechanic] Yeah.
-Brakes? -Yep, struts, brakes, suspension...
steering wheel, everything that was on that list. Six grand worth.
-Six grand, huh? -[mechanic] Yeah.
-Fill it up? -I gotta go, man.
[man on recording] Hey, this is Clay. Leave me a message. I'll call you.
-[signal beeps] -Clay, I don't wanna leave you a message.
I'm on my way to work. I should only take 30 minutes or so,
and then I'm gonna go to the party, but I got no parking instructions, bro.
Nobody called me about parking.
Clay, pick up the phone. Call me back, come on.
Hey, Kate, what's going on? I'm working, sweetheart.
[Kate] Dad, I'm going to the Phoenix tonight, -so I'll be home at, like, 1:00 or 2:00. -1:00 or 2:00?
-so I'll be home at, like, 1:00 or 2:00. -1:00 or 2:00?
-Yes. -What's the Phoenix? -It's a place. -Yeah? What kind of place?
-It's a place. -Yeah? What kind of place? [Kate] A music place, like live music.
Oh, like live music? Wow, that sounds fun. Who's driving?
[Kate] Dad, I'm not calling to ask you. I'm calling to tell you, as a courtesy.
[chuckles] Sweetheart, you're 13 years old. 13. You are calling to ask me. Well, you don't have to go.
13. You are calling to ask me. Well, you don't have to go. You can stay home. Your choice.
[Kate] I think Audrey's driving. But maybe Ryan.
-No Ryan. -Dad!
We're not going through this again. You screwed up with Ryan last time.
[Kate] That's so unfair. You can't make me stay home on a Friday night.
It's not up for discussion, Kate. I can't talk. I'm busy. I gotta work.
I'm just gonna go anyways.
Don't leave the apartment or you're grounded for life.
-Do you hear me? -I'm going anyways.
-Don't leave the-- -I'm going anyways!
Kate...?
[passenger] Red trunk?
[passenger] I mean, I'm not questioning. You must be a good driver.
It's just I've never seen anyone drive a stick on a job before.
Yeah, it's always automatics. Column shifters or whatever.
Wanna hear something funny? My girlfriend thinks I'm too old to rock a hawk.
So, you know what I did? I just grabbed a pair of her clippers.
I just zinged this right-- voop-- right off, like that.
The last couple of weeks... [rustles] ever since.
What's your name, man?
[driver] I don't wanna talk.
What?
Chitchat. I don't chitchat unless it's about the job.
-Talk about the job? -Yeah.
You know, "get in," "look out," "watch for the cops."
-That kind of shit. -Cop? Cop? Where is he? Where is he? [laughs]
I'm just playing.
What's in the bag?
[driver] Sit back.
-What's that? -Sit back.
-What is it? -Sit back.
-I will. -Just sit the fuck back. It's my lunch.
-Your lunch? -Yeah, my lunch.
[driver] I don't know how long I'm gonna be out here tonight, so I brought my lunch.
Oh, so you think we might be out here a while, huh?
Let's hope not, right?
-Just sit back. -Okay.
[mohawk man] You're carrying though, right?
What?
You got a piece on you? A "whistle"? A gun?
All business with the big man up front. No chitchat, no talk. Silent type.
That's Clint Eastwood up front.
You know who that is? Do the brothers love Clint Eastwood?
-What's your fucking name, man? -I'm not telling you my name, man.
-No? -No.
-Nothing? -Nothing.
I gotta call you something.
Three dudes sitting in a fucking car, nothing to call each other--
that's just weird, man. I think that's just--
that's just fucking-- just fucking weird.
Yeah, you know, what's weird, cowboy, is you keep fucking asking me my name.
That's weird. I drive the car. I'm the wheelman, okay?
That's it. End of story.
-That's it, you're just the wheelman? -That's right.
-You just drive the car. -Yeah, I do.
Well, then I'll just call you "Wheelman."
-That's fine. -I know that's fine.
And you can call me "Motherfucker."
-[Motherfucker] What about you? -My name is Ben Okri,
but you can call me "I want my fucking money."
Wow.
The whole thing, huh? Well, okey-dokey, Ben Okri.
The guy in the front has a black belt in fucking weirdness. That's Wheelman.
I'm Motherfucker and...
here we are.
It's still fucking weird, but, at least, we're all somebody, right?
Fuck are you doing? Pull closer.
-I can see everything better from here. -It's a long fucking walk. Pull closer.
I'll be here. I'll be right here.
-Yeah? -[man] You know who this is?
Yeah, I think so.
-[bangs] -Pull fucking closer next time!
[man on phone] Say it.
You're the handler. You hired Clay. Clay hired me.
[handler] So, you're driving for me.
-How do you like the car? -It's fine, man. It's fine. Where's Clay?
-No issues with it? -The trunk's red, but--
-What's that? -Nothing. It's fine, man.
I need the drop. Clay never gave me the drop.
What do you think of the other two?
They're inside doing your thing right now.
-Oh, they're in the bank? -They're in the bank right now.
-I need the drop. I don't have the drop. -What do you think of me?
I don't know you.
You don't know me? You just told me you know who I am.
I know it's your job, okay? I never met you. I don't know your name.
-I don't know anything. -I know you.
Is that right?
How many years did you do for that warehouse fire? Three years.
I'm guessing your ass is a little tender, and you owe big. And so, here you are.
Yeah. What the fuck is this?
For the rest of the night, you don't take any calls except for this blocked number.
When the other two get back in the car, they'll put the money in the trunk.
-Then I want you to leave them. -Fuck does that mean?
-Leave them behind. -I'm not fucking doing that.
-You will. -I'm not leaving them behind.
-They're gonna kill you. -Fuck...
-Where's Clay? -I told them to kill you at the drop.
-I wanna talk to Clay. -Leave them behind,
or they'll shoot you in the head at the drop.
-Open up! Open the fucking trunk! -Fuck. Where the fuck is Clay?
-[phone line beeping] -[Motherfucker] Let's go, let's go!
Hey! What the--? Ugh!
Hey, motherfucker!
Fuck! Fuck!
[recording] Hey, this is Clay. Leave me a message.
-Clay? -I'll call you.
Clay, there's a fucking problem, man! Call me back! -Shit. -[phone ringing]
-Hello? -[woman] ...that's totally ridiculous--
-Hello, hello? -[woman] Hello?
-Where's Clay? -Uh... hey, where'd Clay go?
-I'm not sure... -See if he's there. See if he's there.
He's not here. I don't know where he's at. I just picked up his phone.
-Wanna leave a message? -Listen, tell him to call his driver.
-His driver? -Yeah, his fucking driver. It's urgent.
Don't be fucking around! Tell him to call his driver!
-Okay, his dri-- -Stupid.
-Where the fuck's Clay? -[handler] Where are you?
I wanna talk to Clay, man.
-Where are you? -I don't know.
I don't know where I am, man. Lincoln-- Lincoln and...
Lincoln and 3rd somewhere. Where's the drop?
-You're not headed to the drop. -Come again?
Now that I know you're the kind of guy who would leave his fucking crew behind,
-you're gonna do a few things for me. -Hey, hey! Fuckface!
-You told me to leave them! -[handler chuckles]
It's not your fault. You do what you gotta do to survive, right?
You know what? Fuck you, man. I don't know you. I wanna talk to Clay.
-There's a few things you need to do. -Fuck you! Where's Clay?
You better shut your fucking mouth and do what I tell you to do. You hear me?
-Or you're gonna get hurt. -Why don't you tell me--
why don't you tell me where you are, tough guy, okay?
-And then you could hurt me? -No, we'll get to that.
I hope we do.
First things first. I want you to count the money.
-What do you mean, count the money? -Asshole, pull over and count the money.
I'm not fucking counting anything till I get to a safe spot.
How long?
-Where's "out of area"? -What?
Your number says "out of area."
-Where is that? -Don't worry about where I am.
-Worry about where the fuck you are. -I hope you're somewhere safe, pal.
-How long? -Hold on.
Fuck.
Hey.
It's about 200 grand, maybe a little bit more.
Hello?
Hello?
-[handler] Yeah. How much? -It's about $200,000.
-Did you count it? -Yeah, I counted it.
-It's different fucking bills. -Different bills?
-So, you didn't count it? -No.
Look, it's different fucking denominations. It's about 200,000.
Go fucking count it again!
Go fuck yourself. I'm not counting it again.
Hey.
Hey!
Fuck! Fuck! Damn it.
[mutters] Fucking with this shit...
It's 230 fucking thousand dollars, minus a thousand for me counting it twice.
That's my clerical fee.
[handler] Yes, how much?
Jesus fucking Christ! 230-- where do you keep fucking going?
-How much money is there? -It's fucking two-- it's $230,000.
-You sure? -I'm fucking sure.
All right, sit tight. I'll call you back.
What the fuck is going on?
Fuck.
[handler] You pulled away.
-How did you know I pulled away? -Go to Chandler Station.
[handler] Someone else calling you?
No.
-Is that the drop? -Do you know where Chandler Station is?
Yeah, I know where fucking Chandler Station is.
I'm not a moron. What do you want me to do?
I want you to drive there and don't answer any other phone calls.
-Go fuck yourself. -[ringtone playing]
God...
-Dad? -What's up, Kate?
I'm at home. I just wanted to tell you, so you don't freak out. And this sucks.
Yeah, I know it sucks. Just watch a movie, okay? Good girl.
I called Mom. I'm going over there tomorrow.
-You're not going over there, Kate. -I already called her.
You're not going, okay? This is my weekend.
It's my weekend too, and I'm not gonna sit around here, just waiting around.
-Do me a favor. Listen... -I'm going to Mom's.
I love you. I don't have time for this right now.
-What do you have time for, Dad? -I'm very busy, Kate.
-You and Mom are divorcing-- -Just hang up on him. -Who is that? -[Kate] What? I can't hear--
-Who is that? -[Kate] What? I can't hear-- Who is that? Hey, who is that?
Who is that? Hey, who is that? Is that Ryan? Kate?
-We're just gonna watch a movie... -Put him on the phone.
-No. -Put him on the phone!
-[Ryan] Hang up! -Kate!
Son of a bitchin' kid.
[recording] Hey, what's up? This is Katie.
Leave me a message, and I'll call you right back. Bye.
Katherine, call your father back. Now. Call me back.
[mutters] Pick up the fucking--
-Clay? -What is going on?
This whole thing's gone fucking sideways, Clay.
-Wait, what? What? What do you mean? -This fucking job, it's fucked, man.
This guy's jerking me around. He made me leave the other two guys at the bank.
-What? Who? -The fucking handler guy.
-No, who got left behind? -The other guys.
-He made me leave them, bro. -You left them?
-Where are they now? -I don't know.
Holy shit, those were my guys. You shouldn't have done that.
-Why didn't you call me? -I did fucking call--
I did call you, Clay. I called you 50 fucking times. Look at your phone, man.
-Why didn't you have your phone on? -I have, but--
This guy told me to fucking leave 'em when they came out of the bank. -He said they're gonna shoot me, Clay. -Shoot you?
-He said they're gonna shoot me, Clay. -Shoot you?
-Yes. -He said they were gonna shoot you?
-But you made the drop though, right? -Did I make the drop? You fucking idiot.
-You didn't tell me where the drop was! -It's eight o'clock. It's almost 8:00.
-I know. -It's 7:55.
I know what time it is, Clay! Shut the fuck up!
-Where's the drop? -I don't know.
He's supposed to give you the spot. Man, I knew this fucking guy was gonna pull something.
Oh, you knew he was gonna pull something, but you don't know him? What's his name?
I don't know him. He's a Jefferson Avenue guy. That's all I know.
Yeah, I know fucking Jeff Ave, motherfucker! He's a West End guy.
-What is his name? -I don't know who he is.
-I only talked to him on the phone. -You should be attached to his hip.
I just set it up for him. I don't-- I don't wanna know the guy any more than--
-oh, fuck me. -Yeah, fuck you.
-Fuck me. I know. Fuck me. -Fuck you, Clay. Listen to me.
Listen to me. Are you setting me up, bro?
No, I am not setting you up. He's gonna call you with the drop.
Yeah, since when?
-I... -Since when?
You don't know the fucking ball from the bounce.
You're either too dumb and you don't know it,
or you're fucking dumber and you're trying to fucking set me up!
-Those weren't-- -Why didn't you use your crew?
Those weren't even my guys. He'll call you with the drop, okay?
-You make the drop, we finish this. -Motherfucker. You motherfucker.
You let him put two strangers in the car.
-Well... I didn't know that. -How long we go back? How long we go back? They were gonna fucking clip me, Clay.
How long we go back? They were gonna fucking clip me, Clay.
-You didn't know that? -No.
You didn't know that? I got a call from somebody else. Did you know that?
-What? Who? -Oh, "What? Who?" I don't know.
Somebody fucking texted me that you and I were dead.
You and I were dead. You got any ideas, Clay?
-I don't know. -Say you don't know again, motherfucker!
Say you don't know again! I'm gonna fucking tattoo it on your forehead.
You borrowed that money. You went into the hole with them, not me.
-You chill. -[yells] Don't you tell me to chill!
I gotta get this fucking car off the road, you hear me?
I haven't been out a year, not a fucking year!
-You gotta fix this, Clay! -I'm gonna fix this. I'm gonna fix this. He'll call you. You make the drop, and we're done.
He'll call you. You make the drop, and we're done. Fuck off!
-Fuck! -[ringtone playing]
Put him on the phone. Put him on the phone, Kate.
Dad, I'm not gonna talk to you when you're this angry.
I'm not angry. I just wanna talk to Ryan. It's okay. Put him on the phone.
[Ryan] No. I don't want to talk to him.
-Hello? -Ryan.
Yeah?
I wanna talk to you about being in my home alone with my daughter.
-You listening? -Yeah.
Okay. Our family is going through a bit of a rough patch at the moment,
and what Katie really needs right now, Ryan,
what she really needs is a good friend.
I love my daughter more than my own life, do you understand?
More than my life. More than your life.
-Are we clear? -Yeah.
-You're sure? -Yeah, yeah. -We're just gonna watch a movie. -You're gonna watch a movie?
-We're just gonna watch a movie. -You're gonna watch a movie? That sounds great. And you'll be home by nine o'clock, yeah?
-Yeah. -Good. Put Kate back on.
-[Kate] Yeah. -Yeah.
So, he's gonna watch a movie with you, and then he's gonna leave at nine o'clock.
Okay.
-Do I need to say anything else? -No.
-You sure? Problem solved? -Yes.
Okay. See you in a little bit.
Yeah? [handler] Take the delivery road to the left.
You know, I'm really sick of your fucking music.
-How far up? -Go all the way up around the ramp.
-Straight around? -Just keep going straight.
Take the right, go all the way down.
Where do you want me to make this drop?
[handler] You're not making a drop. You're gonna make an exchange.
Fuck that. Just tell me where to drop the money. I'm not making an exchange.
Go to the bottom. There's a loading dock.
Hello?
Fuck.
[mutters] Fuck, fuck.
[man] He's here.
Fuck.
[man] Hey, get ready.
-[man] Hey! -[tires screech]
[man] Come back here!
Fuck you, you asshole!
[snaps] Fuck!
[Wheelman] Exchange? Exchange, my ass. It was a fucking buy.
-A buy? -A drug buy, Clay.
With who?
I don't know, Clay. Who gives a shit? I'm not running drugs.
Oh, listen, man, I think-- let's not rock the boat on this thing.
-Did you know about this? -No.
-You set this up? -No, I didn't do that.
-I'm trying to get us out of this. -I think you're full of shit, Clay.
[Clay sighs] Okay, then you tell me what you want me to do.
What I want? You set it up.
If you won't do the buy, I don't know what to do.
Find someone to do the buy, Clay.
-Someone else? -Yeah, someone else. Call around.
Find another jerk-off driver to make this buy.
-Get me out of it. -All right, okay. Shit, I'll do it.
-Good. -No, I mean, I'll-- okay, I'll do it.
Yeah, make the calls.
-No, I'm gonna do the buy. -You are?
Just bring me the fucking car. I'll do it. You're out.
-I'm not bringing you this car. -You're not?
-No, I'm not. -Well, you put me in a spot here, man.
-Oh, I put you in a spot? -Yeah.
What do you want me to tell him? Do you know what's gonna happen if I call them?
-Tell me who he is. Tell me who he is. -What? No. Why do you care who he is?
Why do I care? 'Cause it's my ass on the line with the West End guys.
I owe 'em money. It's my ass!
I wanna know who I'm fucking dealing with. I want a name, I want a number.
-I'll tell him you stole the money. -You what?
I'll tell him that you're not taking any of my calls,
and you're running out with his money.
I'll cut your fucking nuts off, I swear to God. You hear me, Clay?
Clay? Clay!
Fucking asshole!
[recording] Yo, it's Cheetah. Leave a message.
Cheetah! Hey, man, I got myself into a situation.
I need some help. Call me back.
Come on.
-Who are you, bitch? - [driver] Fuck it.
[rider] Fuck's your problem? Roll down the fuckin' window, you pussy!
Yeah, right. Come on, motherfucker!
I'm gonna fuck you up, stupid little bitch-ass--
-Oh, fuck! Get the fuck out--! -[tires screech]
[mutters] Motherfuck.
Clay?
You're gonna do this thing, or I'm gonna call him now and tell him you stole it.
Listen to me. This is what's gonna fucking happen.
You're gonna tell me who this fucking asshole is,
and I'm gonna call him and tell him I'm gonna drop this money.
-And we're fucking done. -No.
-You hear me? -You are fucking this up.
-And I'm not gonna be a part of this. -[line beeping] Fuck. Don't hang up. Don't fucking hang up!
Fuck. Don't hang up. Don't fucking hang up! What? Are you shitting--?
What? Are you shitting--?
-This you? -[handler] What are you doing?
Don't say a fucking word. Okay?
I'm gonna drop this money and I'm gonna tell you where it is.
If you fucking call me again, you text me, I'll burn every fucking dollar.
-[ringtone playing] -Shit.
-Clay? Clay! -[horn honking] Yeah, I'm here.
I can't negotiate, I can't fucking threaten them,
I can't fix this unless I know who I'm dealing with.
-I told you, I don't know him. -You are totally full of bullshit.
-[Clay moans] -Okay? I need to know who booked this fucking job.
All you do is sit in a fucking bar and make phone calls.
Make a fucking phone call and get me a name, you hear me?
-I can't. -Clay, I'm gonna call you back.
-I am not calling him. -Five minutes!
-I can't talk to you right now. -You better not hang--
[recording] Yo, it's Cheetah. Leave a message. -[mutters] Fuck. -[signal beeps]
Cheetah! Hey, man, I need you to meet me in the garage down in Grand, all right?
I got myself into a situation. I need some help, brother man. Call me back.
[Jessica on recording] I knew you wouldn't answer.
Kate's calling me, telling me you're not home.
She's there alone with Ryan? That kid is 17.
You left your 13-year-old daughter alone with her 17-year-old boyfriend,
and you know that I caught them...
[recording continues] She said you told her that she can't come with me
because you want to... for some custody thing?
-You're such an asshole. -[horn honking]
I'm giving you a chance with Katie, but I am not-- I can't--
I'm taking Kate. I just-- I--
Come on, motherfucker. Wanna play?
-[faint ringing] -I'm not calling anyone.
-[faint ringing] -I'm not calling anyone. What do you mean you're fucking not calling anyone?
I'm in a fucking bucketload of shit here, which means you're in a bucketload of shit.
I'm in a fucking tunnel with all the money,
and I'm not fucking going anywhere until you give me some fucking answers.
[Clay] Go back to Chandler fucking Station and do what you get paid to do.
-Wait, what? What did you just say? -What?
How do you know I went to Chandler Station?
What?
I never told you the drop was at Chandler Station.
How did you know I went to Chandler Station?
-What the fuck are you talking about? -Where are you?
Where are you, you motherfucker? You at the bar?
-Go fuck yourself. -[line beeps] Oh, you son of a bitch. You piece of shit. Fuck.
Oh, you son of a bitch. You piece of shit. Fuck.
-Yo, it's Cheetah. Leave a message. -[signal beeps]
Fucking me up, Cheetah.
I got a car. I gotta get off the road. Call me back. Call me fucking back.
Fuck.
-[recording] Yo, it's Cheetah-- -[recording stops]
-Yeah? -[handler] What was it I fucking told you?
-What? -You don't listen to me,
-you're gonna get hurt. -[line beeps]
Stop it! Stop-- ugh!
-[Clay] My arm, you fucking-- -Motherfucker, you fucked me!
-[Clay] What the fuck--? -You fucked me!
What the fuck--
-Hey! -Get fucking back!
It's not your fucking problem.
-[man] Are you all right? -[Wheelman] Shut up. Shut up!
Get back! Don't be a fucking tough guy!
-[Clay] You broke my arm! -Wrong man. Wrong person.
Wrong fucking night.
No, don't!
-Who booked the fucking job? -[Clay] I don't know.
-Fuck you! Fuck you, you fuck! -[Wheelman] Who booked the fucking job?
[Wheelman] Get back!
You broke my arm! No!
-Get in the car! -No!
Get in the-- [grunts]
[man] Let him go, asshole!
You fucking fucked me, fucker!
Get back!
[man] Pull that trigger right now, if you're going to.
-[Wheelman] What? -[man] Hey, hey.
-What? -[Clay] Help me!
-[man] I'm all right. -[Wheelman] Shut up!
-Shut up. -You broke my fucking arm.
Look what you fucking did!
[Clay yells] Hey!
-[Clay] Oh, Jesus! -"Oh, Jesus" is right.
-[ringtone playing] -What did you do, huh? Who is this? Who's calling me?
Who is fucking calling me?
-Who is it? -Get off--!
Hey, you fucking threaten me one more time,
I swear to God, I'm gonna Molotov this car and the fucking money, you hear me?
I'll fucking fry the whole thing, I swear to God.
-Hello? -You hijacked my fucking bank job.
You know I'm gonna kill you and that double-crossing cunt next to you, right?
-Oh, shit. Who's this? -You two are fucking dead.
-[Clay] Oh, shit! -[gunfire ringing]
Fuck!
Who was that? Don't fuck with me. Who was that?
[Clay] It's the West End guy.
-Who was that? -That's the West End guy.
That's the West End guy? That's the fucking handler?
Who's the fucking "jazz guy"? Did you fuck--
did you fucking set this up? You motherfucker!
[Clay] Just go!
If that guy shooting as us is the West End guy, who the fuck have I been talking to all night?
-He's just-- -Clay.
-I don't-- -Who is the "jazz guy"?
-He's a new Philly guy. -You fucking with the Philly mob?
He offered me a lot of money.
-For what? To fuck me? -No, not to fuck you.
He offered me a lot of money, man.
-And you broke my arm, you asshole! -Offered you a lot of money for what?
I know how this went down, Clay.
You told him you got a fucking stooge,
who owes the West End guys for a bunch of fucking favors
for taking care of his family while he was in the joint.
-Does that sound about right, Clay? -Jesus, you got a low opinion of people.
-Don't fuck-- -Hey, fuck! I'm fucking around.
-Don't fuck around. Don't fuck around. -Okay, okay. All right.
I wanna know who the West End guy is. Okay? You hear me?
Don't fucking say anything-- anything, except for that!
Clay...
I can't go to the Philly guy empty-handed.
They paid me a lot of money to make the West End look weak.
You fucked us up, man. You know what you did?
You start a fucking mo-- I started a mob war.
I was trying to get ahead, man. I was trying to get ahead for a change.
Now, I'm worse off than when I started.
-I don't know. -Okay.
-All right. -Stupid.
[Wheelman] I'm gonna square it with them.
I'm gonna get straight with the West End guys
because they took care of me when I was inside, okay?
So, I'm gonna take care of business.
And then you're gonna get the fuck out of town.
-Where? Where am I gonna-- -I don't care.
-What's gonna happen to me? -I don't know.
-They're gonna kill me. -Hopefully, they won't.
-They're gonna kill me! -Hopefully, they won't!
-They're gonna fucking kill me! -Hopefully, they won't kill you, Clay!
-Aw, fuck, my dick is cold. -What?
-My dick and my balls are cold! -Stop.
-Is that bad? -Stop. Shut up.
-They're cold. -Don't say another word.
Do not talk, okay?
I'm gonna take $20,000 off the top, and I'm gonna give it to you.
I'm gonna give it to you, I'm gonna square it with them, and you're gonna get the fuck out of my sight.
And I don't wanna see you.
You didn't switch out the cars yet?
Does it look like I switched out the cars, Clay?
I really need that fucking money.
-I'm sorry. -Clay! Clay! Don't--
Fuck! Clay!
Fuck!
Motherfuck!
Jesus Christ.
[Wheelman] What did you do? What did you do?
[Clay, slurring] I'm fucked. I'm fucked.
Oh... oh, boy, I'm fucked up.
-Clay? -I'm fucked--
-Clay? -I'm fucked.
-Fuck. -[Clay grunting]
-Help-- help me. -Fuck.
-Help me. -I can't, Clay. I can't.
Who is he? What's his name? What's the West End guy's name, Clay? Tell me.
-I wanna go. -Tell me, Clay.
-I wanna get out. -Clay?
-[babbling] -You don't have time. Clay, listen to me.
-[panting] -Clay?
Clay?
Clay?
[mutters] Fuck. Fuck.
Yeah.
[Philly] When I said I knew you, I meant I know everything about you.
I know you're not a pro driver.
You're a weekend racer. You're an amateur.
I know you did three years for that warehouse fire.
And I know you've borrowed a lot of money for your family during that time.
You're just a regular guy.
You do what you have to do for your family, right?
And I know you got a wife and daughter. Do you hear what I'm saying to you?
[recording] Hey, what's up? This is Katie. Leave me a message, and I'll call you--
Come on, Katie. Come on, Katie, pick up.
Kate?
Kate...?
-You okay? -No.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Dad, I talked to Mom, and this sucks.
Okay, yeah, I know. I know it sucks. I know it sucks, but listen--
-Dad, Mom is gonna take custody. -She's not--
-She said you blew it. -I didn't--

It's just like driving on the track. You've done it 50 times.
Only go a little bit slower, You take your time.
Dad, what's going on? Why are you being like this?
Listen to me, do you remember where the garage is on Grant?

You're addicted. You can't not do it. You know you could just work at a garage and be home with your daughter right now.
-Jess? -But, no. No, that's not for you...
Hey, Jess, hey, Jess-- hey, Jess, could you shut the fuck up for a second?
This is serious! I need you to fucking do me a favor!
I need you to go get her. All right? I need you to leave the house. Can you do that?

-Jess! -[man] Shut your fucking mouth!
-Jess! Fuck! -[beeping]
[Philly] You bring me that money now, yes?
I know you're not the guy.
You bring me that money or you can listen to get her fucked!
I'll fuck her myself.
-I'll fuck her. -Okay.
Where are you?
-I'm at 32nd. -Where?
-Near the tracks. Let me talk to her. -Stop the car right there.
Stop the car right there! I'll have someone there in two minutes.
-[line beeping] -This will all be over--
-I didn't hijack your job. -[West End] You motherfucker.
Do you still have the money?
Do you?
-Yeah, I do. -There's going to be fucking blood
if that money doesn't come back to me right now.
He's got my wife.
He's got my wife. You hear me?
-All right, I could help. -How?
You start by bringing me the money.
-You bring me that money, or I will-- -Or what?
Or what? What? What are you gonna do? You're gonna kill me, huh? No shit.
No shit, you're gonna kill me. I'd fucking kill me.
[West End] He has no use for her-- other than to leverage you. That's it.
You have the money. You're in control.
If you let him get the upper hand, he'll kill you both.
-You have the money. -I got a daughter!
You fucking hear me? I got a daughter.
He could fucking grab her, too. He snatches her. That's what scares me.
What the fuck scares you? The money? Is that what it's about? The money?
[West End] It's not my money. It's not my money. I guaranteed this job for someone else. This is bigger than $200,000.
I guaranteed this job for someone else. This is bigger than $200,000.
Clay put this job together. That shithead Clay sold it.
This Philly motherfucker targeted this job.
He's taking a bite out of me in front of every motherfucker in town.
What do you think happens if you give that cocksucker the money?
What happens to my people? To my family?
This situation is a weapon.
Me and mine will be eaten alive. That's what scares me.
You're in over your head, and I'm the guy that could pull you out.
What's it gonna be?
-I still owe on the three-year stretch. -Yes.
-You owe us a three-year stretch. -Yeah.
-And I can take care of that, too. -Don't fucking "magic show" me here, man.
Why should I trust you?
-How old is she? -Who?
Your daughter, how old?
-She's 13. -Thirteen.
You help me save my family, and I'll help you save yours.
-What are you gonna do? -What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna kill him.
Okay. Okay.
I got him on the other line. What do I do? He's got my wife. He's got my wife.
[West End] All right.
You set up an exchange. Just set it up and tell me where. That's it.
-Do not fuck me. -Don't fuck you?
You got the money, pal. You got the money.
Okay.
Okay.
You still there?
-[Philly] What the fuck--? -Let me talk to her.
-You wanna talk to her? -Let me fucking talk to her!
You wanna talk to her alive, you pull the fucking car over!
And tell me where the fuck you are.
You wanna listen to me fuck your wife and cut her head off?
-You're not gonna do shit. -You have zero bargaining chips.
Zero! I'll fucking kill this bitch. Do you wanna see your wife again?
Ex-wife, fuckface. And I got your money, asshole.
Come on.
Come on.
[mutters] Fuck.
You're gonna calm the fuck down, huh? Say it.
[Philly] I'm calm.
You want this money? You better stop fucking around.
First, I'm gonna talk to her.
Then, I'm gonna tell you where we're gonna make the exchange. Understand me?
You fucking lay a hand on her, I'll fucking torch the money.
You fuck with me, I'll torch the money.
You pull any bullshit when I pull up, I will torch the money. Put her on.
-[Jessica] Hello? -Jess, it's me. You okay?
-Yeah, but I don't-- -Don't talk. Don't talk.
Listen to me, I don't want you to talk. Don't say anything. Don't say a word.
He's not gonna touch you. All right? I got what he wants,
I'm gonna give it to him. It's gonna be fine, but I don't want you to talk, I don't want you to cry.
Don't give him a reason to even look at you. You understand me?
You just do what he tells you to do, okay?
-Okay. -Okay, baby. Put him back on.
Don't say anything. Just put him back on.
[Philly] So?
Top of Fillmore and 19th, 15 minutes.
-Don't fucking be late. -If you don't give me--
-Fillmore and 19th. -[West End] How long?
-Fifteen minutes. Top floor. -Good. Keep him there.
-How you gonna do it? -You just keep him there.
-He's got my wife. What are you gonna do? -Keep him there until I get there.
You pull this off, you bring him to me, we're square.
Your three years are paid. You just keep him there.
Fuck.
-Fuck. -There you are, motherfucker!
Katie?
Kate.
Hey.
-I couldn't get a signal. -It's okay. You all right?
-Yep. -Good girl.
-Why did you let me drive in your car? -Let's go. Good job.
-Dad-- -Give me the keys. Look at this.
Nice parking.
So, Dad, what's--
[Wheelman] All right. Okay.
[Wheelman] How was the drive?
Fine, I guess. I worked on my downshifting the whole way.
-Good girl. -[engine starts]
-Heel-toe? -No, just regular.
Dad, what's going on?
-Dad, you're bleeding. -I'm fine. It's not mine.
-Why are you bleeding? -I'm fine. It's okay.
You're not okay. We have to get you to the hospital.
Sweetie, it looks worse than it is. I'm fine. I'm not going to the hospital. Sit back. Sit back. Kate... listen to me.
Sit back. Sit back. Kate... listen to me.
We have to take these two bags somewhere right now, okay? Do you understand that?
-Dad, what's in those bags? -Just something I have to deliver.
Money. Is it money?
It's money, yeah.
You're gonna go away again.
-You're gonna go to prison again. -I'm not going away.
I'm not going anywhere, okay? We just have to deliver this money. That's it.
I don't believe you.
Just tell them to come get it. Just tell them that you can leave it here.
-Just tell them that they have to. -Kate! Kate! -Just tell them that you're waiting! -Kate! Stop it! I can't! Look at me!
-Just tell them that you're waiting! -Kate! Stop it! I can't! Look at me!
I can't.
-Everything's gonna be fine, Kate. -You don't know that. I can tell.
-Everything will be fine. -Just shut up, Dad.
If you're just gonna keep telling me bullshit, shut the fuck up.
What do I tell you every time this car touches the track?
[Kate] "You're on the clock."
What are the two most important things when you're in this car?
-Speed and timing. -Speed... and timing.
This is about both.
I want you to take this car, I want you to go to your Uncle Rich's. I don't want you to stop. I don't want you to talk to anybody.
I don't want you to stop. I don't want you to talk to anybody. Don't tell anybody where you are.
-Do you understand me? -What?
-Do you understand me? -No.
Listen, here's my wallet.
I want it back. Yeah?
There's money in here and my ATM card.
-What's the pin? -[sobs] My birthday.
Your birthday. Go ahead.
You tell your Uncle Rich your mom's gonna call you, and she will.
Tell him to keep his promise, okay?
-[sobs] Daddy, I can't-- -Kate, Kate...
Breathe, baby. It's okay.
-[whispers] Daddy, I can't. -No, Kate.
It's okay, baby.
Want you to promise me something, okay?
You don't ever do anything
that doesn't feel right to you, in your gut, inside.
Not for a boy, not for anyone, okay? Promise me.
-Daddy... -Promise me.
-I promise. -You promise?
Slide over.
Okay, find your position.
Where's your position?
Good. Nine and three?
Deep breath.
You're okay.
Daddy, I'm not okay.
-I'm gonna freak out. I can't do it. -No, no. You're not gonna freak out.
You know why? 'Cause you're my daughter.
You're my daughter. You've done it a hundred times.
What do I always tell you, baby?
-"Find the line." -Find the line.
[Wheelman] There it is. That's all it is. I wanna see her. Let her go.
[Philly] Give me my money. You'll get your wife.
[Wheelman] Let her out of the car. I wanna fucking see her.
[Philly] Give me the bag. Step away from the bag.
[Wheelman] I want to see her.
-[Kate] No! -Let her out of the fucking car...
[Philly] Don't fuck me over. Don't fuck me! I'll fucking kill you.
[Jessica] What are you doing? Let's go, come on!
-Mom? -[Jessica] Let's get out of here!
-Let's go! -Mom.
[Philly] Watch what you do. Watch what you fucking do!
[Wheelman] Fuck you!
-[Wheelman] Come on, let's go, let's go! -[Philly] Go! Get him! Get him!
[Wheelman] Down the stairs!
Daddy! Dad!
Dad, where's Mom? Where's Mom?
-Dad, where's Mom? -Go, go, go, go!
-Where's Mom? -Drive! She's safe. She's safe.
Good. Control.
-Where's Mom? -She's fine. She's safe.
They're after us. Just drive.
Drive.
Good. Go. Take a right. Take a right.
-Dad, what is going on? -Shift!
-See him? You see him? No? -No.
-Dad, I don't see him. -Okay, right. Right.
Stop.
-Stop? -Stop!
Go.
Dad, you are gonna have to tell me what is going on.
Belt. We're going for a ride, Kate. Put your belt on.
Come on.
-[tires screeching] -Sit back!
Phone! Pocket! Phone!
-Okay. -Answer it!
Answer it, and put it to my ear. Put it to my ear.
-Hello? -[West End] You're not here.
-Hello? -I'm at Fillmore and 19th.
-Where the fuck are you? What? -Stay there. Stay there. He's on my tail.
-What the fuck are you doing? -I'm bringing him to you.
Lower level, ground floor. You hear me?
-[Kate] Evergreen. -Evergreen.
-[Kate] The entrance is on Evergreen. -On Evergreen, lower level, ground floor. -Stay there! -[gunfire blasts]
-Down! Down! -[Kate] Dad!
What--?
-[Kate] Dad! -Get down!
Down! Down!
Down.
Get the door!
-Get him out. -All right.
Fucker.
[Philly] Fuck you!
Give me the bags. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. You stay down, okay?
Stay down.
Good girl, good girl. Stay down, stay down.
You okay? You good?
-Yeah. -Yeah?
Where's Mom? Dad, why was she here?
Mommy's okay, baby. We're gonna go see her right now.
-We're gonna meet her? -We're gonna meet her.
Dad, I'm sorry I didn't leave you like you said.
I'm glad you didn't leave me like I said. [chuckles]
America is a nation of believers
that is being led by a group of censors, critics and cynics.
All of the people telling you, "You can't have the country you want,"
are the same people that wouldn't stand...
I mean, they said, "Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight."
Oh, we love defeating those people, don't we? Don't we love defeating them?
To all Americans tonight, I make this promise.
We will make America safe again.
We will make America strong again.
And we will make America great again!
God bless you and good night!
I love you.
My name is Roger Stone, and I'm an agent provocateur.
Stone's Rules are things that I have learned in life that I seek to pass on to others
who may want to be in the same business that I'm in.
Or, actually, any business, 'cause they are fully applicable.
So, for example, a Stone's Rule:
"It is better to be infamous than never be famous at all."
Stone's Rule.
One man's dirty trick is another man's political, civic action.
Everything I do, everything I've done, has been legal.
But politics ain't beanbag and losers don't legislate.
The truth will be suppressed no longer.
Lock her up!
Lock her up!
Well, Roger has a really rough reputation.
They talk about "dirty trickster" and lots of other things,
but I've known him for a long time, and he's actually a quality guy.
He's a nice guy.
Just a few descriptions of you here:
"a state-of-the-art sleazeball," "a little rat," "an actor who likes to assume poses."
I believe in winning.
I believe in doing whatever is necessary to win, short of breaking the law.
In the world of political consulting, there are a number of rogues.
But there's... [chuckles] There's really nobody quite like Roger Stone.
Roger is the sinister Forrest Gump of American politics.
He's not just this simpleminded guy, but this Machiavellian, almost crazy guy
who shows up at every key moment in recent American history.
Roger has a great understanding of the media. He understands politics and he understands politicians.
And he always likes to take on somebody that at least has a good chance of winning,
and sometimes it doesn't work out.
He's had some people that I said, "What are you doing with these people?" But, you know... But he loves it and he loves the game.
But, you know... But he loves it and he loves the game.
He has fun with it, and he's very good at it.
[Jeffrey Toobin] In many respects, Roger Stone created Donald Trump as a political figure.
There is no doubt that in tone, in affect, in profile,
the Trump candidacy was a pure Roger Stone production.
When Mexico sends its people... They're bringing drugs,
they're bringing crime, they're rapists.
And some, I assume, are good people.
[Tucker Carlson] Whereas the rest of us looked at Trump
and saw someone who was impossibly vulgar and impolite,
Roger looked at him and said, "You know, this is someone who voters might like."
Roger looked at him and said, "You know, this is someone who voters might like." I mean, Roger actually gets democracy in a way,
I mean, Roger actually gets democracy in a way, I think most people who cover politics don't.
You know, democracy is the process of appealing to the majority.
My name's Donald Trump, and I'm the largest real estate developer in New York.
I own buildings all over the place, model agencies, the Miss Universe pageant.
But it wasn't always so easy.
About 13 years ago, I was billions of dollars in debt.
But I fought back and I won, big league.
Now my company is bigger than it ever was and I'm having more fun than I ever had.
Hello, everybody.
[Roger Stone] Fifteen seasons of The Apprentice not only makes him a smooth television performer,
but think of the way he looked.
High-backed chair, perfectly lit, great makeup, great hair, decisive,
making decisions, running the show. He looks presidential.
Do you think voters, non-sophisticates,
make a difference between entertainment and politics?
Politics is show business for ugly people.
Roger always wanted me to run for president. And over the years, every time a presidential race came up,
And over the years, every time a presidential race came up,
he always wanted me to run.
And I just didn't have interest at that time.
And nor was the country in trouble like it is today.
The American Dream is dead.
[woman] Bring it back!
But if I get elected president, I will bring it back.
Bigger and better and stronger than ever before.

I have never been more excited about a presidential campaign.
I have never seen a grassroots uprising.
This is not the Republicans versus the Democrats.
[man] That's right.
This is the elites of the Republican and Democratic Party
who have driven this country into the ditch
versus Donald J. Trump and the rest of America.
I thank you for your support.
We are on the verge of making America great again. Thank you.
-Take a picture with my son? -[Stone] Yes. How are ya?
And if you decide to run for president in, like, 2039, look me up.
-I will. -[man laughs]
[Stone] I understand how fame works. You know, the four stages of fame.
It's like, "Who is Roger Stone?"
"Get me Roger Stone."
"Get me a Roger Stone type."
"Who is Roger Stone?"
A mock election was planned in my elementary school.
And I was for John F. Kennedy because my parents were Catholic,
and I thought, although they were Republicans, they had a certain sympathy for Kennedy.
But also because Kennedy's hair was so much better than Nixon's hair.
And, therefore, I went to the cafeteria and as each kid would go through the cafeteria line with their tray,
I would tell them, "You know, Nixon has proposed having school on Saturdays."
Well, then the mock election was held, and to the surprise of the local newspaper,
Democrat John Kennedy swept this mock election.
For the first time ever, I understood the value of disinformation.
Of course, I've never practiced it since then.
We Republicans seek a government that attends to its inherent responsibilities,
encouraging a free and a competitive economy,
and enforcing law and order.
[Stone] My first Republican National Convention was 1964.
I was 12 years old.
The woman who lived next door to me, she gave me a copy of a book,
The Conscience of a Conservative by Barry Goldwater.
And I devoured this book in, you know, a day.
It was at that moment that I knew what I wanted to do.
I no longer wanted to be an actor. I now wanted to be in politics.
Little did I know how similar they are.
I became a zealot. I had a Goldwater sticker on my bicycle.
I became a zealot. I had a Goldwater sticker on my bicycle. I wore Goldwater buttons.
I wore a Goldwater button two weeks after the election was over. That's how defiant I was.
[Ann] I met Roger in college.
He was really a total prodigy, in terms of his political ability.
He was talking grown men back home into running for office, electing them.
And then we would sit in our dorm room
and they would call Roger for political advice as to how they should vote on key issues.
His mother once said, "You're not a Catholic.
Your religion is the Republican Party and your god is Richard Nixon."
Bart Porter asked him, you know, if he'd be interested in coming to the Nixon campaign,
so Roger took time off of school to go join the campaign.
[reporter] This is central headquarters for the Re-Elect Nixon Campaign.
The White House.
But for the sake of appearances,
the Re-Elect Nixon headquarters, in name, is one block up Pennsylvania Avenue.
[Stone] The Committee to Re-Elect the President was unlike any campaign that I'd been in.
It didn't look like your typical political headquarters.
It had a very hushed, corporate quality to it.
Porter called me into his office and said, "We want you to go to New Hampshire,
and we want you to give this contribution to Pete McCloskey,
who's running for the Republican nomination,
challenging Nixon from the left,
in the name of the Young Socialist Alliance."
I got an enormous mason jar,
filled it with pennies and nickels and dimes and quarters.
I brought it to the McCloskey headquarters. I said, "Hi, I'm from the Young Socialist Alliance.
I wanna donate this, and I need a receipt."
They were so dumb, they gave me one.
The idea was to give the receipt to the Manchester Union Leader,
the largest newspaper in New Hampshire, as a way of discrediting McCloskey.
A perfect example of a dirty trick that had no purpose and no effect,
but the Nixon people thought it was great.
I never heard another word about it...
until an investigator from the Senate Watergate Committee knocked on my door.
[reporter 1] We have a mystery story out of Washington. Five people have been arrested and charged
with breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the middle of the night.
[reporter 2] The Democratic National Committee is located in the Watergate office building.
I welcome this kind of examination,
because people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook.
Well, I'm not a crook.
I've earned everything I've got.
I was the youngest person to go to the Watergate grand jury.
During the Senate Watergate Committee hearings, this enormous chart was put up,
in which everyone who received money from this secret fund was put on the wall.
And it said, "Gordon Liddy, McCord, Segretti."
And then way down at the bottom, it said "Stone."
I paid $100 to Mr. Roger Stone on one occasion.
My parents called me on the phone. They were mortified.
I thought it was pretty cool.
To leave office before my term is completed
is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
But as president, I must put the interests of America first.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
[Stone] I was a Watergate figure at 19 years old.
I mean, at the time, I was scared shitless.
It was very hard to find work.
We used to have these buttons that said "hire a Watergate vet."
So this is the Batcave. This is "the Factory," as we call it.
This is where I tape my Saturday radio shows.
It is also the repository
of probably the world's largest collection of Nixon memorabilia.
The 1962 campaign for governor.
Uh, a rally that I actually attended.
A head shot poster of the day.
This is protesting Nixon's historic trip to China.
Here you have the first and second generation Nixon bongs.
This is among my most prized possessions.
[reporter] Roger Stone does occasional political chores for Nixon.
One such chore, to organize dinners of journalists at Nixon's New Jersey home.
[Stone] I was the assigned liaison between the Reagan campaign
and former President Nixon, transmitting memos back and forth.
It was not until his post-presidency that we became close friends.
He had been through a lot, obviously, but I think he was just as resilient as ever.
His greatest single quality is resilience.
And that's the purpose of my tattoo. It's not an ideological statement.
It's a reminder that in life, when you get knocked down,
you have to get up off the canvas and keep pushing, get back in the game.
That's the story of Nixon.
A man is not finished when he is defeated. He's only finished when he quits.
[Toobin] The Nixon tattoo is really all you need to know about Roger.
Because he thinks Nixon's approach to politics,
the toughness, the win-at-all-costs mentality,
that's what Roger reflects.
Delegates to the Young Republicans Convention in Memphis
have chosen as their chairman a conservative with a Watergate past.
[reporter] Watergate dominated this convention because the Republican Party's important youth arm
was about to be taken over by Roger Stone, a 25-year-old political operative
who was deeply involved in the 1972 Nixon "dirty tricks" campaign.
[Paul Manafort] They embellished what was a 20-year-old kid's role into being the mastermind of Watergate.
Roger saw the opportunity to build a reputation
off of being viewed as that politically significant.
[reporter] Opponents of Stone contend that his election is part of a move by conservative activists
to take over the Republican Party.
[Manafort] When we elected Roger,
we moved the Republican Party in a more ideological direction.
Up until that point, it was straddling the old Republican establishment
and the new conservative movement that was started in Barry Goldwater days.
We built on that,
and I think when Roger was elected chairman of the Young Republicans,
you know, that was the piece that finalized everything.
For many years, the Republican Party
was associated with this sort of good guy, Eisenhower earnestness.
What happened with the new right was there was a new generation of people who said,
"You know what? We're gonna fight dirty and we're gonna win."
Among the revolutionary changes in American politics the past few years
has been the rise of the political action committees, called PACs, fund-raising groups for special interests.
called PACs, fund-raising groups for special interests.
[reporter] NCPAC, the National Conservative Political Action Committee based in Virginia,
rich in money, and dedicated to doing in the nation's liberals.
Even, its director Terry Dolan says, if that means using the politics of fear.
I don't think there's anything wrong with fear.
[Stone] I met Terry Dolan when we were teenage Republicans together in Connecticut.
[Ann] When we got married, Terry was our best man.
But more than that, he actually ended up moving in with us.
We used to refer to him as "the child."
It was on our living room floor that NCPAC was born.
NCPAC, the National Conservative Political Action Committee,
is transformative in the sense that we really pioneered
negative campaign advertising in massive doses to win elections.
Up to that time, it really hadn't been done.
I came to Washington for the Wall Street Journal
in, um, the very end of 1983.
And Roger was already kind of a legend by then, kind of a dark legend, [chuckles]
because of the negative ads that he and NCPAC had run.
So people thought of him as kind of a wizard behind the scenes.
I remember meeting him on the street and thinking, "Wow, that's Roger Stone."
[announcer on TV] Birch Bayh telling us he's fighting inflation.
The price tag on that baloney is $46 billion.
Because if Bayh wins, you lose.
The story of NCPAC is that after Watergate,
there were campaign finance reforms
to try to control the corruption in spending on politics.
So what the Republicans did was,
they figured out a way around the new rules.
[Manafort] The focus of NCPAC was to use all the tools of a campaign,
but instead of having a candidate, to use it through a PAC.
[Stone] We could only give a Senate campaign, in a direct financial transfer of $5,000.
But the loophole was we could advertise on behalf of a candidate,
without their cooperation or coordination, an unlimited amount.
And that's why NCPAC was successful.
[reporter] It was a political disaster for Senate Democrats. They not only lost control of the Senate,
they lost some of the biggest names in the Democratic Party
and many of their most prominent liberals.
Regrettably, NCPAC consistently plays to the dark side of human nature.
Its stock-in-trade is the half-truth, the innuendo, the distortion.
[man on TV] Power is what PACs are about.
The power to raise and give money to political candidates,
who, in turn, will at least give them a hearing and at best do their bidding.
Roger was one of the inventors of the modern political system.
The PACs, the super PACs.
That is where Roger has made his influence, and it continues to be felt.
I'm convinced that at some point, with these types of programs,
you could elect Mickey Mouse to the House or the Senate.
[announcer on TV] Ronald Reagan for president. He'll make America great again.
[Stone] The district we're in is Congressman Gary Lee.
After this, we go to the 32nd District, where those guys just got knocked off the ballot.
-You're good at this. -[laughs]
You must have had some experience.
[Stone] 1980, Ronald Reagan defeats Jimmy Carter.
I was running three northeastern states for Reagan,
as a regional political director.
I think most observers didn't recognize
Reagan's enormous appeal to blue-collar Catholics and working-class people.
And, of course, he carried all three states and the presidency.
And I'm proud of the fact that I played some tiny, infinitesimal role
in saving the United States by electing Ronald Reagan.
The Reagan voter is a blue-collar,
working-class, middle education, middle-income-level voter.
Roger identified the Reagan Democrat.
He actually wrote up the strategy
for reaching out specifically to the blue-collar and the Catholic vote.
He tends to be a second, third-generation Catholic... Italian, Irish, Polish.
[Ann] The Reagan Democrat was a critical part
of bringing over states that normally would not vote Republican.
Let us pledge to each other, with this great lady looking on,
that we can, and so help us God,
we will, make America great again.
-[crowd cheering] -Thank you very much.
Roger is unique, in my experience, because he actually embraces infamy.
He doesn't worry that you think he's a sleazeball. He wants you to think he's a sleazeball.
What a cheap, low-class way to operate.
[man] Why do you embrace the role of dirty trickster?
Well, I'm stuck with it now.
It's gonna be in the first paragraph of my New York Times obit,
so I might as well go with the flow.
The only thing I can think of worse than being talked about...
is not being talked about.
-[crowd cheering and chanting] -♪ Used to be a fan of Bill ♪ ♪ Blue dresses And spunk was spilled ♪
Now, Bill and Hillary Clinton would steal a hot stove. -[crowd laughing] -These people are career criminals,
-[crowd laughing] -These people are career criminals,
and thus far, the mainstream media has helped conceal their crimes.
But the truth will be suppressed no longer.
[chanting] Lock her up!
[Stone and crowd chanting] Lock her up!
Lock her up! Lock her up!
[Stone] The slash-and-burn politics of today are what's required to get noticed.
God bless you. I'll be happy to sign books for those patriots who are smart enough to buy them.
If you can't communicate with people,
you can't get them to adhere to the idea you are trying to educate them about.
You have to be outrageous to get noticed.
"For Roger, with fond memories and the highest regard and affection
for his good work in the 1980 campaign. From a good friend, Roy Cohn."
[commentator] This is a man that everybody is going to enjoy meeting.
He's Roy M. Cohn,
who was confidential assistant to the United States Attorney General.
[reporter 1] In 1953, Roy Cohn became chief counsel to Senator Joe McCarthy's
communist-hunting investigations committee.
[reporter 2] His reign of televised intimidation in the 1950s
has become synonymous with demagoguery, fearmongering and character assassination.
[reporter 3] Cohn went on to private practice and made millions.
He became one of the most politically connected lawyers in the nation.
[reporter 4] The last two decades of his career were marred
by allegations of fraud, blackmail and perjury.
When I was assigned New York for Ronald Reagan in 1979,
for the 1980 election,
shortly thereafter I was invited to a dinner party
being thrown by a Washington socialite...
who, in all honesty, I was trying to lay...
and Cohn was present.
So I made my way up to him.
I introduced myself. I said, "Mr. Cohn, I'm... I'm Roger Stone."
He looked at me and said,
"Are you the son or the grandson of the Roger Stone
who's running the Reagan campaign here in New York?"
I said, "No, that's me."
He turns to his partner Tom Bolan. He says, "Reagan's in trouble."
[Wayne Barrett] I wrote a lot about Roy Cohn.
I started hearing about Roger from people who were close to Roy.
Roy Cohn is the single most evil person I have ever covered.
If that's a magnet for you as a young man, it says you're soulless before you start.
Well, my attitude regarding those who criticize me
for being friends with Roy Cohn or Richard Nixon is... fuck 'em.
[Ann] Roger's relationship with Cohn was, in part, mentor.
Cohn had a slice of history,
and a circle of friends that would not have necessarily been part of our orbit.
It's how we met Trump.
Donald Trump is probably one of the most important names in America today.
He is, as I say, the closest thing to a genius I've ever met in my life.
On "Special Segment" tonight, Mike Jensen profiles a man
who, at the age of 39,
is not content with being New York City's latest real estate billionaire.
Donald Trump has also ventured into gambling and professional football
and says he could negotiate a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union.
[man on TV] Donald Trump, a tough man in a tough city.
Steve, you're gonna have to start pushing these people now,
'cause it's getting a little ridiculous, as far as I'm concerned.
[man on TV] At the age of 39, Donald Trump has become
one of America's best known and most successful builders.
And, not surprisingly, he has an ego almost as big as his empire.
I had a lawyer, who was a very good lawyer, tough lawyer, named Roy Cohn.
He introduced me, at one point, to Roger Stone.
Roy thought Roger was a very tough guy.
Roy knew some very tough guys, I will tell you that,
but Roy always felt that Roger was not only tough, but a smart guy and very political.
[man on TV] Trump is an expert at getting what he wants,
particularly from politicians.
He's gotten tax abatements and other concessions.
Politicians have gotten campaign contributions. Big ones.
[Manafort] Roger's the first one who introduced us to Donald,
and Donald was one of our clients at Black, Manafort, Stone
in the early '80s and was a client of ours for a long time.
[Toobin] In the early days of the Reagan administration,
Roger was so prominent and so successful,
he could have become a sort of great man of the party.
He was a real insider.
He was a political consultant, a lobbyist,
someone who was right in the thick of things.
Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and I had worked together through the Reagan campaign.
When the Reagan campaign got short of cash,
and decided to start a political consulting firm.
Paul Manafort came in one day and said,
"You know, we ought to start a lobbying firm,
because I'm getting a lot of calls from people who know we all work for Reagan
and know the people who are gonna be in the Reagan administration,
and they want lobbying."
So we did.
-Good to see you. -This is Paul Manafort.
[Manafort] What we were doing was trying to use our relationships that we had built up,
first through the Young Republicans and then through NCPAC,
and to create a business that would focus on political consulting.
[Jane Mayer] Lobbying had been considered kind of a sleazy business,
but Roger Stone unabashedly came out and said,
"I'm gonna make a pile of money off this  and no apologies."
Black, Manafort & Stone was the shit.
It was the biggest, most powerful lobbying operation in Washington.
We did things that nobody else had ever done.
♪ Money for nothin' ♪
[Mayer] There were a lot of gray people
in gray suits and tan raincoats in Washington.
They were all sort of interchangeable.
And then you had Roger Stone.
And when he went to fancy parties, he wore black patent leather slippers.
He was a whole new level of, sort of, splash and show business and money and glitz.
♪ Money for nothin' ♪
[interviewer] Joining us now, Roger Stone,
who belongs to one of Washington's most successful consulting firms.
The argument, I gather, seems to be that you helped elect 'em,
and now you're helping to tell them what to do,
and this really isn't what the Founding Fathers had in mind.
First of all, the term "influence shops" is really not accurate at all.
I think that what we provide for our clients,
be them foreign countries or corporations or individuals,
is a superior understanding of how Washington works.
[Toobin] Before Black, Manafort & Stone,
it was considered somewhat distasteful for campaign types
to immediately go into lobbying,
trying to influence the people they just elected.
What Black, Manafort & Stone said was, "We're unapologetic.
We got this guy elected, and now we're going to make money
by charging for access to his administration."
There's been a massive expansion of the lobbying sector in Washington.
Some of them are so powerful and successful that we don't question it.
We just assume it's a fact of American political life.
[Toobin] Black, Manafort & Stone, in their brazenness,
really created the modern sleazeball lobbyist.
[Harry Siegel] They elected people.
As soon as those people were in office, they lobbied them.
And so they crossed a line that hadn't been crossed.
Washington's been worse for it ever since.
[reporter] Paul Manafort of Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly
stands with his partners at the receiving end
of $31 million in subsidies.
I will stipulate for the purpose of today that you could characterize this as influence peddling.
[congressman] Thank you.
I will bring new people to Washington.
People that come there to serve and not to profit.
We will have the highest possible ethical standards.
We're gonna bring in the best.
[reporter] The best?
Charles Black is a senior advisor to Bush.
So are Paul Manafort and Roger Stone.
And Lee Atwater is George Bush's campaign manager.
All these men are partners in a firm that, in 1985,
received $3.4 million in foreign lobbying fees.
Black, Manafort & Stone saw a business opportunity
in being the torturers' lobby.
in being the torturers' lobby. In representing the most distasteful dictators,
In representing the most distasteful dictators,
Mobutu, Marcos, UNITA in Angola.
They did not care about being acceptable in the salons of Georgetown.
They cared about making money.
You know, one man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist.
[reporter] There are reports of gross human rights abuses in rebel-held areas,
including the burning alive of Savimbi's political opponents.
The Cold War was going on.
You know, I'll take criticism if they give it to Reagan
and the majority of Congress who put the funding in.
[reporter] Tens of thousands of men have been killed or wounded in the fighting.
The US missiles will escalate the war even to a more deadly level.
When people think of Washington corruption,
they think of organizations like Black, Manafort & Stone,
that shook down dictators, took all their money,
and then tried to take America's government
and make them serve the dictators' interest.
You know, it is the swamp.
I'm proud of the job I did at Black, Manafort & Stone, because I made a lot of money,
and I can't think of anything I did that was either illegal or immoral.
You play by the rules as they're written.
When they change the rules, you change the way you play the game.
[Toobin] When you talk to Roger about his business and morality,
he sees morality as a synonym for weakness.
That's something that he's always going to have contempt for.
[Stone] Those who say I have no soul, those who say I have no principles,
are losers. Those are bitter losers.
Everything I have done, everything I have worked for,
is to propel ideas and a political philosophy that I want to see dominant in government.
Donald Trump has now elevated the issues that I believe in.
Anti-elitism, that was first identified by Richard Nixon...
To you, the great silent majority...
[Stone] ...mined by Ronald Reagan...
Government is not the solution to our problem,
government is the problem.
[Stone] ...and now Donald Trump.
The silent majority is back, and we're gonna take the country back.
The image they have of politics is a dirty image of politics.
It's that, um, everybody's for sale.
When Trump talks about, you know,
"I gave my money 'cause I thought I might need a favor later."
Everyone's for sale.
Nobody's there to serve the public good.
It's an anti-government view and an anti-political view and, um...
very lacking in idealism, very cynical.
There's no nobility in it.
The money in politics? Well, I think there should be, frankly, more transparency.
Because I see a guy like Jeb Bush with $114 million,
which is now higher, and nobody even knows who put the money in.
And they all control him like a little puppet, okay? I know half of the people.
I don't know who they are because I can't find it out.
But as soon as I do, I will know most of 'em.
They're friends of mine. I used to be there.
I used to be the king at that, okay?
[Barrett] In 1981, Roger runs Tom Kean's campaign for governor in New Jersey.
Donald is just really getting into the throes of casino life in Atlantic City,
so they came together on a common agenda.
[Matt Labash] Trump gave him a lot of casino business.
Roger and Trump, peas in a pod, you know?
Trump is someone, through the '80s, who took enormous risks and succeeded.
Roger represented Donald Trump from Donald Trump's earliest days.
Then the Ethics Commission made a finding against Donald Trump and him
for all of the illegal things that they did.
When Roger wants something, he pursues it with vigor.
Now politics, sort of.
New York developer Donald Trump caused a stir this morning when he took out an ad in some major newspapers
charging American foreign policy lacks backbone.
Immediately the question came up, is he running for something?
In 1987, I suggested that Trump should explore a bid for the presidency.
This sounds like political presidential talk to me,
and I know that people have talked to you about if you wanna run. Would you ever?
Probably not, but I do get tired of seeing what's happening with this country. And if it got so bad, I would never wanna rule it out totally,
because I really am tired of seeing what's happening with this country.
I was like a jockey looking for a horse. You can't win the race if you don't have a horse,
and he is a prime piece of political horseflesh in my view.
I interceded with the Portsmouth, New Hampshire Chamber of Commerce
to arrange a lunch.
The helicopter landing was as big a news as his speech.
This is kind of the first time I saw the power of Trump.
The public interest in Trump was palpable.
It was, like, electric.
And he lit the place on fire.
I'm not here today because I'm running for the presidency.
I'm here because I'm personally tired
of seeing this great country of ours being ripped off.
Roger always wanted me to run for president.
And in 1988, he wanted me to run, but I had no interest.
I did a book called The Art of the Deal,
which was the number one best-seller of the year. It was a tremendous book.
Roger wanted me to run so badly, and I just didn't want to do it.
What I want is, I want extreme competence.
I want strength and extreme competence.
[Michael Caputo] In 1988, when I was at the New Orleans convention,
Roger Stone had me setting up chairs in a reception room
for an executive out of New York who I didn't really know, Donald Trump.
Even though his candidate for president, Jack Kemp, had the possibility of being selected as vice president,
he was squiring Donald Trump around the convention.
You have said that if you ran for president, you'd win.
I'd have a very good chance. I like to win. When I do something, I like to win.
I like to do well, and I think I probably would have a pretty good chance.
Roger saw the value of the outsider image.
He saw the value of somebody
who brought business experience to the political process.
He saw something that nobody else saw back in the early '80s.
Once he'd had conversations with Trump about that, Trump started to take seriously that maybe he should run.
[Donald Trump] So long. Thanks a lot, folks.
Florida is a great place to live.
It's a sunny place for shady people.
Welcome to Casa del Stone.
This is, uh, where I live with my wife, three cats and three dogs.
And my 91-year-old mother.
Tough as nails.
If you ever saw The Sopranos and you're familiar with Tony's mother,
that's my mother.
These guys are liberal filmmakers. They cannot be trusted.
Hi.
Come here, Sambo.
Sammy is, uh... He's not well.
He's been losing weight. And we've been taking him back and forth to the vet.
Come here, baby. Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss. No kiss? No kiss?
Okay. [kisses]
This is my wife.
We met working on the Reagan campaign,
where she was employed as a photographer for the campaign
and I was working for Reagan as a regional political director.
This is the designated smoking area.
Kind of a contemplative garden.
[man] What do you contemplate out here?
Political strategy and destroying my enemies.
[announcer] And now may I introduce Mr. Roger Stone to all of you.
Bill Clinton is a Bill Cosby-style sexual predator,
who has preyed on probably hundreds, but at least 27, individual women.
If Bill Cosby is going to be held responsible for his actions,
then Bill Clinton should be held responsible for his actions.
Bill and Hillary Clinton are the penicillin-resistant syphilis
-of the American body politic. -[crowd laughing]
-...everything you're doing. -Thank you very much. You, too.
-Hey, sir. -How ya doing?
-Pleasure. -Good to see you.
This is my daughter and my granddaughter.
Hello. How are you?
I'm excellent.
-Thanks for coming. -Of course. Of course.
I was going to point out that...
[Danielle Stevens] There's a side of him that they don't see. The side we get to see. The family side, the loving side.
That persona of the dirty trickster is not what we see at home.
-We do see the trickster. [laughs] -[Stevens] Yeah.
Hold up your lens up here just a little higher.
Little higher. Little higher. Little higher.
Yeah, that's it. Okay!
[Nydia Stone] I was actually terrified of him the first time I met him.
I walked in his office, and I told him later that he looked like a Nazi Hitler Youth.
Nydia taught me how to smile and how to laugh.
Uh, and she's made me a better person. And I'm not complete without her.
[man] You're a Buddhist. Do you think that you centered Roger?
-Yes. -[Stone] She certainly has tried.
And I think, in some cases, she has been effective in doing so.
-[Nydia] Centered and censored. -[chuckles]
And sometimes I need both.
And with Nydia, I got instant family.
I got children. I got grandchildren.
I got a mother-in-law.
All things that I didn't have with my first wife. So I became a family man overnight.
He is a political strategist,
and he was just named the senior advisor to the Dole presidential campaign.
That should be an interesting job in the next few months. -Roger Stone! -[crowd cheering]
Roger...
I think we've got this figured out. We've got the slogan. "Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.
Together they offer the people 133 years of experience."
[crowd chanting] We want Bob! We want Bob!
[Dole] Thank you.
I can't imagine Roger being less excited to work with a presidential candidate
than he was with Bob Dole.
There are endless reasons to end the failed presidency of Bill Clinton.
But renewing the strength of America by restoring our social and moral order
has got to be somewhere near the top of that list.
The Dole-Kemp ticket was still counting on the evangelical vote
to defeat the Clintons.
In fact, if you look at the numbers back then, there was no way they could win unless they had that vote.
There's no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government.
They see scandals almost on a daily basis.
They see ethical problems in the White House today.
[man] Do you think that's a legitimate issue? I do. I think the character of the president of the United States--
[man] Do you think this issue of marital fidelity, which you keep blaming on the media, is a legitimate issue?
This is something the voters are gonna wanna know about, yeah.
[Carlson] Roger could have become much more successful in conventional terms than he did.
And the reason he didn't is because he self-sabotaged.
[reporter] There was once a time
when political consultants were unknown and unseen.
No more.
Some of the tabloids say a Republican strategist, Roger Stone,
a partner in the prestigious Washington lobbying firm
of Davis, Manafort & Stone,
has been advertising for sex in swinger magazines along with his wife, Nydia.
He joins us from Washington. -Good to have you with us. -[Stone] Surely.
[reporter] Do I quote you correctly, that these ads were planted by someone else out to get you?
Yes, indeed, um...
An exhaustive investigation now indicates
that a domestic employee who I discharged for substance abuse...
on the second time that we learned that he had a drug problem,
is the perpetrator.
I'm deeply troubled by this notion of paid sources
who can say anything anonymously about you.
Provide no photographs, no proof, no documents.
You know, it's very hard.
My granddaughter, who's seven years old, said to my wife on Sunday,
"Why are they doing this to you, Grandma?"
It's a very hard question to answer.
[reporter] All right, appreciate you joining us. -Thanks for being here. -Glad to be here.
Roger Stone's first impulse was to deny.
In fact, if you look at Stone's Rules,
one of the rules is "deny, deny, deny, deny."
And he began by following his own rules.
'Cause it wasn't until much later that he admitted that everything was true.
The National Enquirer scandal,
which I'm not interested in rehashing at great length,
uh, probably required that I be even more of an outlaw.
I never ran for public office.
So how I conduct myself in my private life is nobody's business.
Did you hear about this? This guy, Roger Stone, top Republican advisor for Bob Dole,
has now been accused of going to sex clubs with his wife.
It's unbelievable, isn't it?
On the other hand, this gives you an idea how conservative the Dole campaign is.
This guy is in trouble for having sex with his wife!
That's how conservative those people are. Having...
[Labash] I think something snapped in him when the swinger scandal happened,
and he got chased out of Washington.
And he just said, "Eff this. What do I need this for anymore?"
What the '96 scandal meant is that Roger was never gonna be the out-front political genius.
The Karl Rove, the David Axelrod.
He was always gonna have to operate in the shadows.
If it weren't for 1996 and all the trouble he had,
maybe Roger wouldn't have embraced the kind of, you know,
darker side of his capacity, of his talents.
If there hadn't been a sex scandal in 1996, we might have had a President Al Gore.
They always return to the scene of the crime.
[crowd chanting] We want Bush!
We want Bush! We want Bush! We want Gore! We want Gore!
This is where the recount of the 2000 presidential contest took place.
This is where the recount ended.
This is where George W. Bush became president of the United States.
[reporter 1] Good grief. Look at that. Eleven.
[reporter 2] Eleven. That means automatic recount.
[William Daley] There is one state left to be decided,
and we believe when those votes are counted
and that process is complete, totally complete,
Al Gore will have won the Electoral College and the popular vote
and, therefore, is... will be the next president.
[reporter] The hand recount in Florida will continue, and the votes will count.
That, according to a unanimous ruling from Florida Supreme Court last night. Vice President Al Gore praised the decision, saying,
"It allows for a full and accurate counting of the ballots."
This is a street fight for the presidency of the United States.
I want our protestors down there in Palm Beach, Tallahassee, and Miami.
Call Roger Stone.
[Stone] In 2000, my old friend Jim Baker called me
and asked me to go to Miami-Dade to work on the recount.
I thought it was vitally important that we matched the Democrats
in terms of protesters who wanted an end to the 2000 presidential election.
This country was born on civil disobedience
and the will of the people standing up against the powerful!
There's nothing wrong with Clinton getting his dick sucked in the middle of the Oval Office, is there?
This is where the trailer was set up to communicate with our operatives inside the building.
[woman] He's got a ballot!
He stole a ballot!
[Stone] When some of my operatives reported that two democratic commissioners
were attempting to take a sheaf of ballots, remove them from the counting room,
which was being viewed by reporters and lawyers for both sides,
and take them to a small anteroom without windows,
this is what sparked the so-called Brooks Brothers Riot.
I said, "Flood the hall and don't let them shut that door."
[crowd chanting] Let us in! Let us in!
[Toobin] They started banging on the doors
and were intimidating the people who were counting the ballots to stop.
And they did stop.
So Al Gore could not gain any votes.
That was critical in making sure that the results in Florida,
certifying George Bush as the winner, stood.
[crowd chanting] Let us in! Let us in!
Most people, they want to underplay anything they did wrong or improper.
And with Roger, what you have to worry about
is that he's lying to make himself worse than he actually was.
The history of the 2000 recount was essentially written by Roger Stone,
and he wrote himself in, in a pretty big role.
He was sitting next to Washington as they crossed the Delaware.
He was with Eisenhower on D-Day.
He was cradling Bobby Kennedy in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel.
[laughing] I mean, he really sort of put himself there.
I mean, Roger was there.
But let me ask you,
is it more brilliant and impressive to influence world events
or to stand on the periphery of world events
and yet get recorded as having influenced world events?
Maybe the latter.
Yeah, I think he played a role in the Brooks Brothers Riot.
I don't dispute that.
But I'm the only one to approach
what I think is the best story I've ever done on Roger.
I don't believe George W. Bush would have ever been president of the United States if it wasn't for Roger Stone.
if it wasn't for Roger Stone.
We're back now at 9:40 Eastern Time.
Ross Perot proves to be a major factor here tonight.
The Bush campaign headquarters in Houston,
they believe that Ross Perot may have cost them the presidency.
Thank you.
[Barrett] When George H. W. Bush loses in 1992, we all know the reason he lost.
It was the Reform Party and Ross Perot.
[Stone] The Reform Party was drawing a disproportionate number of votes
from the Republicans.
Bill Clinton, the great politician, he never got 50% in any election.
No Ross Perot, no Bill Clinton.
[Barrett] So when the son is running in 2000,
and the Reform Party is still on the ballot
in every state in the United States,
then they're very concerned
about who is going to wind up the Reform Party candidate for president.
Today, I am ending my lifelong membership in the Republican Party
and I'm declaring my intention to seek the nomination of the Reform Party
for the presidency of the United States of America.
[Barrett] Roger Stone comes up with the brilliant idea
of getting Pat Buchanan out of the Republican line
and to get him to run for the Reform Party.
[Stone] Yes, I... I encourage him to run,
but I also, yeah, I have an interest in the Reform Party imploding at that point.
[reporter] Just when Buchanan hoped to have the political stage to himself,
he was trumped.
Businessman Donald Trump announcing today,
he too will switch from the GOP to the Reform Party
and may even seek its presidential nomination.
And if he does, he says, it will not be just a publicity stunt
for his empire of office buildings, casinos and hotels.
He will run to win, he says, despite his reputation.
When Donald Trump announces that he's going to run, it completely throws everything into chaos.
George, should the American people take the Reform Party seriously?
Well, not if Donald Trump is their leader.
[reporter] Donald Trump is being supported by a fellow named Roger Stone,
who is a longtime political activist who had worked for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.
It looks to me like Pat Buchanan is going to get in the water,
and a Trump-Buchanan race, it'd be a great race.
It's unexpected. No one sees it coming.
And to make matters worse, Trump doesn't exactly run for the nomination
so much as he runs against Pat Buchanan.
He's a Hitler lover. I guess he's an anti-Semite.
He doesn't like the blacks. He doesn't like the gays.
[reporter] What's wrong with Pat Buchanan?
Well, it's pretty obvious, isn't it?
He's obviously in love with Adolf Hitler in some form,
and I don't think the Reform Party should be taking losers.
Have a good time.
Bear in mind that the arch-strategist of the Trump campaign is Roger Stone.
Do you think that Roger is up to something here that deserves closer inspection?
Well, Roger's always been a little arch. Uh, I don't know that he's the arch-strategist.
Do you think that Trump is just a stalking horse for, say, George Bush?
[Timothy Stanley] Stone goes overnight from backing Buchanan to backing Trump,
it's very hard not to conclude that Stone had intended all along
to undermine Buchanan's candidacy
in order to make the Reform nomination completely untenable,
and thus give Bush a clearer shot at the presidency.
Political observers this morning are still wondering
what Donald Trump really wants. Is he running for president,
or just getting his name and face on television?
[Barrett] He was in the game enough to get a tease to the national news media,
and then out of the game.
I'm ashamed of this party!
[reporter] Political pros say that to have any impact on the race for the White House,
the Reform Party will have to shed its image as a circus. [man] We will not have mob rule in this party.
[man] We will not have mob rule in this party.
[Barrett] Now, what Roger freely admitted to me, is that he had known since the Nixon days
that Pat Buchanan had an illegitimate child.
Nominating somebody for the president of the United States
whose name will appear on the ballot in all 50 states,
who you are blackmailing at the same time so that he won't really run.
That's not just a dirty trick.
That's a transformation of democracy.
[Stone] The allegation that I spread the rumor that Pat Buchanan had an illegitimate child,
this all comes from Wayne Barrett.
Wayne Barrett is full of shit. It's false.
[Stanley] Pat Buchanan got less than half a percent of the vote.
That was humiliating.
Humiliating for him, for the Reform Party,
and arguably it put the entire third party campaign effort back by decades.
After the Reform Party cost the Republicans the White House in '92,
again in '96...
Yeah, I may have played some role in derailing them as a party.
Roger Stone knows how to do the triple bank shot.
The one that nobody else can do.
And it ends up changing the face of a campaign.
Changing the whole tenor of a debate.
Shifting the entire paradigm.
People today say that they like doing dirty tricks. They're pikers compared to Roger.
Roger has raised it to an absolute art form.
Sometimes you confuse me with the Stephen Colbert character
that I sometimes play called Roger Stone.
Don't... don't confuse him with the real Roger Stone.
-[man] What's the difference? -You'll have to sort that out.
[Steve Malzberg] Joining me now, Roger Stone,
political consultant and strategist. And great to see you.
There is a Hillary-Nixon connection that's very historic and important.
In 1964, Hillary Clinton was fired from the House Nixon Impeachment Committee
for leaking and lying.
Now, she held this grudge for 40 years.
Hillary repeatedly blocking Nixon from meeting with Clinton.
Finally, Clinton overrules her.
Nixon and Clinton meet, and they hit it off.
And Nixon met Hillary. I said, "Mr. President, what did you think?"
-He said, "She's cold. Cold as ice." -[chuckles]
[man] You're doing a documentary? Yes, this gentleman's doing a documentary.
He's one of those dangerous liberal, pinko, left-wing...
I hate people like you.
...homosexual, New York Times commies, but he's not a bad guy.
I know who they are.
Part of the reason we've always paid attention to Roger,
is he just looks different from everyone else.
You know, here we have a bodybuilding dandy.
A category, as far as I'm concerned, of one.
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the Prince of Darkness, Roger J. Stone.
I am no longer a Republican. I joined the Libertarian Party.
[Toobin] I do think he is really alienated from the contemporary Republican Party.
He is, I think, spiritually, and now politically, a libertarian.
From the time that I was a Young Republican, I always had a libertarian streak.
I have always been pro-choice, pro-gay marriage, pro-marijuana.
As a Libertarian-Republican, I've always believed in gay marriage equality.
It's a civil right that equal access is guaranteed by the Constitution.
So, uh, I'm going to the Gay Pride parade today.
[woman] Let's welcome the Log Cabin Republicans!
The Log Cabin Republicans is the nation's only organization of Republicans
who support fairness, freedom and equality for gay and lesbian Americans.
He may have, as a result of his personal life,
some authentic beliefs at the age of 60 or 61.
I think he's internalized some of the gay rights agenda.
I think he's internalized some of the pro-drug agenda.
After the scandal devours him in 1996...
Since he's been rejected
and essentially thrown out of mainstream Republican politics,
he doesn't really have any choice but to figure out some third-party avenue.
And so he's looking for a reprise of 2000.
He's looking to see if he can find an angle where he can matter.
I've stayed away from Roger, personally, because he's so charming,
and you can see the ways in which he distorts the reporters who are around that charm.
At the same time, there's no way to avoid writing about him,
since he's been everywhere dark and ugly in our politics for many, many years.
In 2004, he's blamed for forging the documents
that destroyed Dan Rather's career and also helped re-elect President Bush.
[Terry McAuliffe] Roger Stone, an old dirty trickster from the Nixon days,
may have been involved in the production of these documents.
Look, politics is a rough-and-tumble business, but this is just a cheap shot.
[Siegel] That same year, Stone consulted for Al Sharpton's presidential run
that helped disrupt the Democratic primary process.
What Stone is in this for, is to use Sharpton as a disruptive force.
Some out there who follow presidential politics ascribe to you magical powers,
consider you the puppet master of the Sharpton campaign.
Look, Roger's always been an outlaw
and drawn to like-minded outlaws, like Sharpton, like Trump.
I don't think that's changed at all. What's changed is the country.
[Siegel] A few years later, he took credit for bringing down his nemesis, New York governor Eliot Spitzer.
I am deeply sorry that I did not live up to what was expected of me.
I am resigning from the office of governor.
[Siegel] He says he got a tip from a hooker in a sex club.
You had heard that the governor liked to wear his socks when he engaged in sexual activities?
I ask you, Dominic, what kind of guy does it with his socks on?
Sounds like Eliot Spitzer to me.
[Toobin] Roger understands the dark heart of the media
even better than we understand ourselves sometimes.
Because if he tells us that Eliot Spitzer was wearing black socks when he had sex,
he knew that that would be irresistible,
even if it had absolutely nothing to do with the truth at all.
[man] What do you say to people who say,
"It's awfully convenient that you happened to meet a prostitute
who was involved with Eliot Spitzer, given your animus toward Eliot Spitzer"?
Uh, there are skeptics everywhere.
Stone's so desperate to stay in the public eye,
that he peddles garbage conspiracy theories.
Like the supposed tape of Michelle Obama saying "whitey."
Roger, you can't just say that and say you have no proof for it and make a comment like that.
No, no, no. Let me finish.
[Siegel] And worse, the now infamous "birther" lie
that President Barack Obama is a secret Muslim
and a Manchurian president who wasn't really born in America.
[reporter] Donald Trump's one of the last people that was still touting that,
because Roger Stone and he were conspiring one day
and Roger giggled and rubbed his hands together and said,
"I can get the real birth certificate from Kenya."
And Trump, you know, went and believed it.
If he wasn't born in this country, -it's one of the great scams of all time. -[Bill O'Reilly] Absolutely.
-But I don't think that's the case. -Well, you don't...
There's something on that birth certificate that he doesn't like.
[Whoopi Goldberg] Oh, my God! -That's a terrible thing to say! -[all arguing]
Have you ever heard of any white president asked to be shown their birth certificate?
When you become a president of the United States of America,
you know that he is American.
I'm sorry, that's BS.
Why is Donald Trump so happy to throw himself into the "birther" pool?
Longtime Trump casino lobbyist and GOP advisor Roger Stone told Politico
"Personally, I think it is brilliant. It's base building.
It gives voice to a concern shared by many on the right."
Is there such a thing as coded appeals to racist sentiment?
-There is such a thing. -[Stone] Of course, but I see none here.
-There is such a thing. -[Stone] Of course, but I see none here. Okay, as far as you're concerned.
The whole "birther" movement,
which was so crazy and so wrong and so racist,
that is the basis of Trump's political appeal.
[Trump] Ladies and gentlemen,
I am officially running...
...for president of the United States,
and we are going to make our country great again.
What's your precise role with Donald Trump?
-Are you a paid advisor? -Uh... I am now.
I'm just helping as a general communications strategist, I guess.
People get the impression that this is performance art for Donald Trump.
Is he serious about being president of the United States?
I will build a great, great wall on our southern border,
and I will have Mexico pay for that wall.
-[woman] Yes! -Mark my words.
Is this a president talking?
If there is one murder,
if there is one crime by someone who is not supposed to be in the country,
that's one crime too many.
I think Trump has identified a legitimate hot-button issue.
"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown
of Muslims entering the United States
until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on."
[Mayer] Roger Stone came to power with Nixon.
And Nixon, of course, had the Southern strategy,
which was all about milking people's racial resentments,
and in the case of Trump, anti-immigrant resentments.
Working up hate that would turn them against the government
and against the so-called elites who were in government.
The political system is a cesspool.
I've been a lobbyist.
I worked on the Senate side. I worked on the House side.
I saw how the sausage are made.
The whole process is deeply corrupt.
Trump is the only one who can clean it up.
[crowd chanting] Trump! Trump! Trump!
Trump! Trump! Trump!
We are going to Washington, DC,
and we are going to do what?
Drain the swamp.
It is so corrupt.
The best part is that he's just kicking the political establishment in the balls.
They are shitting a brick, because he's challenging the status quo.
All these other candidates are really for the status quo.
Roger's the ultimate insider, which makes him incredibly good at seeing
how to package someone he could sell as an outsider.
We are going to stand up for the American worker
like nobody has ever stood up for that worker before.
There is real upset over jobs, over globalization,
over people losing their sort of status and their incomes. You know, there are all kinds of answers to these questions,
You know, there are all kinds of answers to these questions,
but the answers that he's provided, for the most part,
are the answers that billionaires are interested in.
We're also going to eliminate job-killing regulations.
And lift the restrictions on the production of American energy,
including shale, oil, natural gas and beautiful, clean coal.
There's no grassroots movement
to gut the EPA and give people dirty water and dirty air.
The only people who are really caring about that are the polluting industries.
They say I have the most loyal people. Did you ever see that?
Where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, okay?
-It's, like, incredible. -[crowd laughing]
Roger understands that I've always gotten great ratings,
whether it's on The Apprentice or virtually any interview,
and that's why people want to interview me. And I think that's one of the things that's always fascinated Roger,
because, ultimately, it is all about the ratings
and it is all about people watching and the eyeballs.
Mr. Trump, you've called women you don't like "fat pigs,"
"dogs," "slobs," and "disgusting animals."
-Your Twitter account-- -Only Rosie O'Donnell.
Unlike every other candidate I have ever worked with,
he is unscripted, he is unrehearsed, he is unhandled.
Contrast that with Jeb Bush, who looks both bored and annoyed,
like, "Just... This is mine. Just anoint me and give it to me.
Father, Father, tell them it's my turn to be king."
[interviewer] Roger, before you go, uh, will you remain with the Donald now throughout the campaign?
I'll do whatever the Donald asks me to do.
[reporter] Good evening. It's been 48 hours since the first Republican presidential debate,
and a testy exchange between Donald Trump and moderator Megyn Kelly
has become a flash point in the campaign.
[Trump] You know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, uh,
blood coming out of her wherever.
Now members of the Republican field are lining up to criticize him.
And word this evening that an advisor and a longtime friend of Trump's
has resigned from the campaign.
Trump says he fired him.
[Trump] Roger Stone's a nice guy, but I let him go because I really wasn't using him,
and he liked to get a lot of publicity for himself, which I didn't want.
He's real, he's genuine, and it's entertaining.
That's why he's doing so well.
-So why'd he fire you? -He didn't. I quit.
"Oh, you can't fire me. I quit!"
[Labash] Did he get fired or did he quit? I don't know.
He still hasn't admitted to me that he got fired, and I've tried numerous times.
"Bullshit, you got fired. Come on."
"No, no, no!"
Because Roger, you know, Roger the feminist, was really offended
about what Trump said about Megyn Kelly.
[Stone] I don't need the Trump campaign to generate press coverage for myself,
and I can get in the tabloids any time I want.
But to say that you want me to work on your campaign, but you don't want me to talk to reporters
would be like saying to me, "I just don't want you to breathe air between now and November.
If you could just agree not to breathe any air or eat any food, everything will be fine."
Talking to reporters is what I do. That's my value.
Roger Stone and I don't agree on anything. [stammers] I don't...
Roger Stone and I don't agree on anything. [stammers] I don't... -He does not represent the Trump campaign. -Not what he says.
What Roger Stone says and what the truth are are two factually very different things.
[Michael Caputo] There's no question Lewandowski worked behind the scenes to get Roger thrown out of the campaign.
He is an expert at stabbing people in the back.
That guy's got an incredible capacity for treachery.
By the way, I spoke to a Polish language expert the other day.
I was unaware of the fact that Lewandowski, loosely translated,
means "cocksucker."
Well, Roger is a tough guy, and Roger will make enemies sometimes
that I always say, there's no reason for it.
[Toobin] Roger is older now,
and I think he sees the Trump campaign,
at once as his creation,
but also something that he's not allowed to participate in day to day.
And that, understandably, makes him sad.
[Stone] I have no interest in going back.
Although I strongly support Trump, we have managerial differences.
And, meanwhile, I'm just making the very best case for him in public that I can,
'cause I do think he has what it takes.
There's always this tension between the candidate and his consultant.
The candidate resents the credit the consultant gets for his words.
The consultant resents, you know, the fame and fortune the candidate gets
when he did all the work.
And Trump hated the fact that Stone was showing up on cable news
and that people were, you know, calling him Trump's brain.
So he fired him.
But it doesn't mean he stopped relying on him.
It seems to me there is more than meets the eye here
with Roger Stone parting company from the Trump campaign,
coming on my program and others and giving the big Trump pitch.
-You media types are so conspiratorial. -[laughs]
No. No, the Stone-Trump types, I think, are the conspiratorial.
Unlike...
Only two campaigns have a plausible path to the nomination.
Ours and Donald Trump's.
Nobody else has any mathematical possibility, whatsoever.
L-Y-I-N-apostrophe, lyin' Ted!
The Bible held high, he puts it down and then he lies.
Most of the time, I win the evangelical vote.
The evangelicals, the Christians, like Donald Trump.
I'm a straight shooter.
[reporter] After a crushing 13-point defeat in Wisconsin,
Trump turned a page, sidelining campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.
[Trump] He wasn't as effective for the last couple of months.
[reporter] News breaking that the GOP front-runner, by the way, has hired Paul Manafort to lead his campaign's convention efforts.
has hired Paul Manafort to lead his campaign's convention efforts.
Paul Manafort, former partner of mine, the single best vote counter
and convention strategist in the Republican Party.
When Paul Manafort got publicly named, I got a phone call that day.
And it was Roger on the other end of the line.
And you know what he sang? "Back in the Saddle Again."
I mean, Roger knows what Roger's doing.
[Manafort] Trump asked me to get involved because my reputation, among other things in politics,
is understanding of the convention process, the delegate process.
And most of the major successful big conventions
over the last 30 years, I've been intimately involved in.
[man] Did Roger recommend you for the job?
Roger was one of the two or three people who strongly recommended me, yes.
Even after Roger stopped being the principal political advisor to Trump,
he continued to be a very important advisor, and is to this day.
[interviewer] I want to start with Roger Stone, because you just launched a pro-Trump super PAC.
I thought, A, Donald Trump didn't like super PACs, B, I thought you quit or he fired you.
I'm not still sure what happened there. So what the heck is this all about, Roger?
Roger told me when I was very young, "Caputo," he says, [chuckles]
"The media is two things.
They're either evil or they're lazy, or they're both.
And if you understand that, you can do whatever you want."
Yeah, I live a pretty Machiavellian life, and I'm a skeptic.
I tend to believe the worst of people because I understand human nature.
Human nature has never changed.
That's why one of Stone's Rules is that hate is a stronger motivator than love.
That's because it is.
[Ted Cruz] The National Enquirer published a story.
It is a story that quoted one source on the record, Roger Stone.
Let me be clear. This National Enquirer story is garbage.
And it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.
[Stone] One of the keys to defeating an opponent is getting inside their head.
He incorrectly claims that I am the source of this story
regarding allegations that he has been adulterous.
[Cruz] And I would note that Mr. Stone is a man who has 50 years of dirty tricks behind him.
He's a man for whom a term was coined...
for copulating with a rodent.
I, of course, am quoted in this story, on the record,
saying that it would hurt him badly with his evangelical followers.
He has, as you know, attacked me on CNN...
Roger Stone has been Donald Trump's chief political advisor.
He planned and ran his presidential campaign.
...attacked me on Megyn Kelly.
His entire business has been dirty tricks, has been lies, has been personal smears.
These attacks on me by him and by his surrogates, I find this most satisfying.
I hope he's laying awake at night, worrying about what I'm going to do next.
[Mayer] He's a little bit like the Joker in Batman.
I mean, he gets a kick out of doing this.
To some extent, his pleasure [stammers] at burning down the house
is infectious for people.
And as a reporter, you call him up because you want the outrageous quote.
You want, you know... You want to hear what he's gonna say.
He's also very plugged-in. He's in the know.
He talks to a million people.
[Stone] I just got a call from this reporter who was calling to warn me
that Corey is now openly telling people he's got the goods on Manafort.
He is telling reporters that he has something on Manafort
that will blow him out of the campaign.
Yeah, we gotta take the little prick out.
I've been backgrounding reporters on what a total fucking disaster he's been.
And there's a story that just went up by Mike Isikoff at Yahoo
that dips into the whole Pakistani blah, blah, blah.
If you look at Manafort's long history of lobbying,
it is about as controversial as you can get.
You are as connected to the insider game of, what you've even said on record yourself,
"influence peddling," as anybody.
How can you be the antidote or anything to help Trump when you seem to go against his main message?
It depends on who you talk to
if I'm part of the establishment or part of the antiestablishment.
You better get rid of the super PACs
because they're causing a big problem with this country.
...and a lot of bad decisions that are being made
for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
Donald Trump tells America the system is rigged by the lobbyists and the super PAC money,
and who does he turn to as his top guys?
Roger Stone and Paul Manafort, who literally put up that rigging.
It's a crooked system, it's a system that's rigged,
and we're going to go back to the old way. It's called "You Vote and You Win."
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
Donald Trump is riding a crest of voter anger
over 30 years of failed policies.
Voter anger explains the entire rise of Trump.
[Trump] I love the old days.
You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They'd be carried out on a stretcher, folks.
Go fucking make my tortilla, motherfucker, and build that fucking wall for me!
Trump!
[crowd chanting] Trump! Trump! Trump!
Roger Stone, he's very smart about anger.
It's one of the things he understands best.
It's angry, white working-class voters whose resentments are being milked
to push an agenda that's useful to some of the richest people in the country.
These are hardly people who are in tune with the little guy's interests.
Um, but they understand how to manipulate the little guy's interests.
-[Malzberg] Can you hear me? -Yes, I can.
-[Malzberg] Can you hear me? -Yes, I can. -Can you hear me? -You're awesome.
Easy on the rape stuff. Let's not--
I'll do the best I can, but--
-I know, I know. Let's just, like... -Facts are facts, you know?
Do you believe it's too early for Trump to be bringing up Bill Clinton?
Should Trump save all of this
and wait until he's the nominee and he's running against her in the general?
No, I don't agree. I don't think he had any choice, 'cause he didn't bring this up.
Hillary Clinton brought it up when she attempted to play the victim card.
Does he know everything that's in your book? Are you giving him information at all?
Well, as you know, and it's been well documented,
she went after the women very, very strongly and very viciously,
according to the women and according to other sources.
Uh, a major book's been written about it. And it's a book that's a very well-respected book.
And it's a book that's a very well-respected book.
[Siegel] If you read Roger's blog, The Stone Zone, or follow him on Twitter,
it's like coming attractions for the attacks Donald Trump will be launching two weeks later.
It is Hillary who hires the heavy-handed private detectives
who break into these women's homes and ransack them,
who threaten their children, who kill their pets.
[Trump] She's married to a man who was the worst abuser of women in the history of politics.
And Hillary was an enabler, and she treated these women horribly.
Roger's, you know, relationship with Trump has been so interconnected
that it's hard to define what's Roger and what's Donald.
While it'll be clearly a Trump presidency, I think it's influenced by a Stone philosophy.
Shake-up at the Trump campaign as the campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski,
has now parted ways with the campaign.
[reporter] Paul Manafort taking the reins of the Trump campaign.
[Carlson] Well, let's see.
Is it a surprise that Paul Manafort [chuckling] wound up as the campaign chairman for Trump?
No, of course not. That was engineered by Roger
as a way to get Corey Lewandowski bounced out of the campaign.
It took a couple months, but they did it.
Roger has had a guiding hand in all of this.
Now, Trump is hard to guide.
He spits the bit out.
You know, he doesn't want to be driven at all.
But Roger's had as much influence on the campaign as anyone.
I think the campaign's being professionalized. Manafort's doing a phenomenal job.
I think he instills confidence in the campaign that they didn't have before.
[man] Did you give any reporters background on Lewandowski?
No.
[crowd chanting] Just stay silent!
Just stay silent! Just stay silent!
Just stay silent!
Just stay silent!
[reporter] How often do you talk to him?
Uh, from time to time.
Are you an informal advisor? Would you call yourself that? I'm just an FOT, Friend of Trump.
We need, in our country, law and order.
And if I'm elected president, that will happen.
[reporter] How real is the Dump Trump movement inside the Republican Party?
It's real because you've got, now, an attitude within the Republican Party, at the highest levels,
that this would be better for the party.
[reporter] Discussions about cutting Trump loose are focused on the Republican Convention.
Finding a way to free delegates for Trump to vote for someone else.
[Stone] I could see Donald Trump going to the convention in Cleveland
and having the nomination stolen from him.
So, I have set up a convention operation to try to ensure
that the Republican nomination is not stolen from Donald Trump.
[Trump] I'm representing a tremendous many, many millions of people.
I think you would have problems like you've never seen before.
I think bad things would happen. I think you'd have riots.
I have warned the public of what I believe is "the big steal."
We're going to have protests.
We will disclose the hotels and the room numbers
of those delegates who are directly involved in the steal.
[man] What about the issue of Donald Trump's hit man, Roger Stone,
threatening violence in Cleveland?
-Appropriate rhetoric? -I'm not giving him my hotel room.
-Okay, so do you sort of-- -[stammers]
Roger is not an official part of the campaign.
-Did he bring you in? Okay. -No. In fact, not at all.
Roger Stone threatened yesterday that he will send Donald Trump supporters
to the hotel rooms of any Republican delegate
who tries stealing the nomination from Trump this summer.
And those delegates will probably answer the door, too,
because they're expecting a prostitute.
-[audience laughing] -"Hey!"
-Caputo. -How are you, man?
-I'm good. -What's going on?
-Thank you. One more photo? -All right. Give 'em hell.
[man] Mr. Stone.
-How are you? -Thank you for your years of service.
Thank you very much. I appreciate it. That's very kind.
Make America great again.
I'm very sorry, but I am not gonna do this again.
[reporter] Delegates were denied an opportunity to vote on the rules.
Some saw it as their last chance to take the nomination from Trump.
[crowd chanting] We want Trump! We want Trump!
Trump is able to take over the Republican Party because the Republican Party is a bit like the Reform Party in 2000.
It's become a shell.
When it's something which is so out of touch with its own voters,
someone who steps in and communicates through social media
straight into television, with tremendous charisma,
is able to steal the party.
One half of the Trump story
is the story about how one man's ego led him to take over the Republican Party.
The other half of the story is how the Republicans became so hollow
that someone could do that to them.
The Trump campaign is the apotheosis of Roger Stone's politics.
-America! -[crowd cheering]
[Toobin] It's the part of the Republican Party that he represents:
toughness, anger, not being politically correct.
If you look at the crime rate in places like Chicago, it's out of control, yes.
Trump is the law and order candidate. He does speak to the silent majority.
I'm here with Roger Stone, the one and only.
Kind of a legend in political consulting, and, I think fair to say,
Kind of a legend in political consulting, and, I think fair to say, one of the, if not the, architect of the Trump movement.
You've had an interesting career, because you were in the kind of establishment political world
and you had a great career there.
Then you kind of went off into your Stone world for a while.
And now you're back. Now you're a big deal.
We're now in the age of Stone.
I mean, I feel like it's come all the way around,
back to the days when you and I and Terry Dolan
were plotting a takedown of the establishment.
Then we became the establishment. Then we became antiestablishment.
Roger is a lot more than a dirty tricks artist.
He kind of grabs that persona. It's like his pro wrestling name.
But in the real world of politics, he's a real strategist.
And I think whenever he kind of creates the dirty trickster thing for the media,
he's having fun, but he's slumming a little bit.
You're a rape denier! You're a rape denier!
America may be collapsing and breaking apart,
but Roger Stone is determined to enjoy it.
This for you, right here. It's "rape." It's Bill Clinton. It says "rape."
Okay, you know who does this kind of shirt? First of all, a sick guy.
Get him, Stone! Come on!
You know who's accused in court papers of being a rapist?
-Donald J. Trump! -[Stone] By Jane Doe.
By Jane and Tiffany Doe.
-Jane Doe. Who's Jane Doe? -[Uygur] It's in court papers.
-You're a sick man, Roger Stone. -No. You're a liar. Stone-cold liar.
-[Uygur] You're the biggest liar. -No.
-You're a piece of-- -[Stone] Spitzer, he's a great guy?
First of all, Alex, this ain't your fucking show.
And, Roger, it surely ain't your fucking show!
Blowjob! Blowjob! Blowjob! Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!
You're a hatchet man. I don't know why anyone in the media takes you seriously.
[Stone] You're a lightweight. You don't know anything.
All you do is lie. You're known as the biggest liar in media.
All you do is lie. You're known as the biggest liar in media. -[Stone] Name the lie. -The biggest liar in media.
Name a lie, loser. There's nobody watching your show, dude.
The guy starts pointing at me and yelling like a maniac.
"You're a liar! A proven liar!"
I say, "What have I lied about?" He says, "Eliot Spitzer."
I said, "He didn't like hookers? He doesn't like to choke women?
Don't you read the newspapers, dude?"
[Caputo] Roger doesn't want to be considered a sweetheart.
He's gonna be considered the Prince of Darkness.
And if he dies with that on his tombstone, I think he'll consider himself a success.
-[Stone] I wanted to say hello. -Hey. How are you?
[Manafort] Roger's relationship with Trump,
they both see the world in a very similar way.
If Trump is elected president, I think Roger will see
one more very significant impact he's had on world history.
[Ivanka Trump] I could not be more proud tonight to present to you and to all of America,
my father and our next president, Donald J. Trump.
Friends, delegates and fellow Americans,
I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination
for the presidency of the United States.
[crowd chanting] USA! USA! USA!
I would argue that Roger Stone, after 30 years working for Donald Trump,
is one of his primary influences, perhaps the primary influence.
And to think that the guy who calls out people on Twitter like Roger does,
who's done the things and told the stories,
is actually in the catbird seat with a Republican nominee
is something for the record books.
CNN has banned Roger Stone, the Republican strategist and former Trump advisor, from appearing as a guest.
This after the discovery of his offensive tweets against CNN contributors.
Stone once called Ana Navarro an "abusive diva" and "borderline retarded."
Stone also called then-contributor Roland Martin
a "stupid negro," a "moron" and a "token,"
and suggested he eat more fried chicken.
To ban someone because you disagree with their views
demonstrates you're not really a news organization,
but you're an opinion organization.
CNN means Clinton News Network.
There are more people watching Infowars.com
than watching MSNBC and, at some hours, CNN combined.
[Alex Jones] Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
Roger Stone, the consummate Trump insider, the vice-Trumpian joins us.
You've got Alex Jones, he's like the sort of main conspiracy theorist,
probably the most popular in American life now.
You know, Roger Stone goes on that show every day.
There's this crazy vortex of all that stuff back from the '90s
just now sort of exploding through the channel of Trump.
I'm never a lesser-of-two-evils person,
but with Hillary, there's not even the same universe.
I mean, she is an abject, psychopathic demon from hell.
[Stone] Alex Jones is very important.
I realize the elite media likes to call him a conspiracy theorist.
I don't like 'em putting chemicals in the water that turns the frickin' frogs gay!
Do you understand that?
[grunting] I'm sick of this crap!
[Stone] He has a bully pulpit that allows him to reach millions of people,
and they are Trump's people.
They are outsiders, skeptical about government,
skeptical about the bullshit government is always trying to peddle you.
Mexico is a globalist client state.
And they teach 'em, "America belongs to you.
You're gonna get the gringo. Plan of San Diego."
Don't know what that is?
It's a plan to take over in a race war and kill all whites below the age of 16.
Sure it's a non-elitist crowd, but they're Americans and they vote.
Tell us, Mr. Trump, about Mr. Stone, who helped get this interview set up.
Well, Roger's a good guy, and he is a patriot.
He's a tough cookie, but people like him.
But he's been so loyal and so wonderful.
And thank God for the Breitbarts and the Daily Callers
and the Townhalls and the Infowars.com
and the so many alternative media sites where we can learn the truth
and we can tell the truth and we can spread the truth.
This is not conservatism as we have known it.
This is not Republicanism as we have known it.
These are racist ideas, race-baiting ideas,
anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-women.
All key tenets making up the emerging racist ideology known as the alt-right.
I think Trump should get more, you know, more, quote, "conspiratorial."
We created ISIS.
The vacuum created by George W. Bush and then Hillary Clinton armed ISIS.
ISIS is honoring President Obama.
He is the founder of ISIS. He's the founder of ISIS.
I would say the cofounder
would be Crooked Hillary Clinton, cofounder.
I think it's whatever Roger Stone e-mails Donald Trump in the middle of the night.
-He wakes up, and that's their strategy. -That's right.
[coughing] Excuse me.
So go online and put down "Hillary Clinton illness."
Take a look at the videos for yourself.
This fringe allegation that Hillary Clinton is not well, her health isn't good, is something that we're seeing
her health isn't good, is something that we're seeing more and more with Donald Trump supporters.
Some of the Breitbart readers have brought it up. Also, Roger Stone has been talking about it.
She's got no stamina. I think it's abundantly clear.
She doesn't have the strength or the stamina
to make America great again. Believe me.
The people behind Trump's candidacy,
including Giuliani, including Roger Ailes, including Roger Stone,
including his so-called brain trust, believe this stuff works.
[Labash] Now the children's table is the adult table.
And Alex Jones is, you know, passing the dinner rolls.
And we're all conspiracy America now.
[Stone] Thank you.
Even if Donald Trump loses, I still win,
because the Stone brand has been front and center,
and my brand of politics have finally come into their own.
CNN, MSNBC, they're now the fringe.
Alt-right communications, we are the mainstream.
Did Trump really believe that Obama was not born in the United States?
Does Roger Stone really believe that Bill Clinton raped all these women?
You know, it doesn't matter to them is more the point.
It's their tactic in the political wars.
And for them, there are no boundaries. Anything goes. Anything that wins, fine.
[reporter 1] Today, WikiLeaks releasing 1,700 new stolen e-mails.
[reporter 2] The Clinton campaign is accusing a top Trump advisor
of scheming with WikiLeaks and Russian intelligence
against Hillary Clinton.
I, actually, have communicated with Assange.
I believe the next tranche of his documents
pertain to the Clinton Foundation.
Have you spoken with the WikiLeaks founder?
No, I have not spoken to Mr. Assange,
I have not met with Mr. Assange, and I never said I had.
[reporter] House Democrats now saying in Washington,
"Let's investigate Roger Stone's ties to the Russians."
Has the FBI interviewed Roger Stone about his communications with Julian Assange,
or his knowledge of how WikiLeaks got these illegally obtained documents?
I can't comment on that.
[Stone] Only Mr. Assange knows what he's going to do.
Now, I think he's a hero, fighting the deep state,
taking on both the Republicans and the Democrats.
Taking on the establishment, really.
[reporter] Law enforcement sources tell CNN that the FBI has been conducting multiple investigations
and it continues to examine allegations against Roger Stone, a Trump supporter,
about possible connections to WikiLeaks.
Those probes include a year-long investigation
of Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort
and his firm and their alleged ties to pro-Putin figures in Ukraine.
These cyberattacks come from the highest levels of the Kremlin,
and they are designed to influence our election.
I find that deeply disturbing, and I think it's time...
-She has no idea whether it's Russia... -...you take a stand... ...China, or anybody else.
-I'm not quoting myself. I'm quoting 17... -Hillary, you have no idea.
[Stone] The Clinton thugs, they're the ones saying,
"Donald Trump is a traitor to his country, in bed with Vladimir Putin,"
a man he's never even met.
Russia, if you're listening,
I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing.
It's the low road in American politics.
They have unabashedly embraced the toughest tactics you can take.
And you can see it in Roger Stone, and you can see it in Trump.
I mean, no boundaries to what they would do.
They'll twist the truth if they need to.
They're cynical about politics.
They think people who take the high road
or who try to act virtuously are chumps.
The Trump campaign's latest reboot now underway.
Two new top officials who Trump is bringing in.
Pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager,
and Breitbart News honcho Steve Bannon to be Trump's new campaign CEO.
Sources say Manafort is being, quote, "sidelined."
Another bombshell from the Trump campaign today.
The resignation of the embattled campaign chairman Paul Manafort,
amid a wave of bad headlines
and growing questions about Manafort's connections to Russia.
Also added to the team is the disgraced Fox News chief Roger Ailes,
and also Roger Stone, who is a political operative.
Roger Ailes, Roger Stone, Steve Bannon, they play rough.
Bannon is a bomb thrower in the Stone mold.
Somebody I like enormously. He's got guts.
He understands new media in a way that I think no one else in the Trump campaign did.
He understands the fine points of the Clinton oeuvre, if you will.
Uh, he has republished all of my toughest material
from The Clintons' War on Women at Breitbart News.
So he understands the enemy better than, perhaps, anybody else in the Trump campaign.
And like Donald Trump, he's fearless.
He's tough as nails. He's driven.
Uh, I think he's the campaign's secret weapon at this point.
Good evening, everybody. It is now established,
this is indeed the dirtiest presidential campaign in modern history.
[reporter] The last four weeks of the campaign, Roger Stone said it's going to be brutal.
Earlier today, the Washington Post released audio of Donald Trump from 2005.
[woman] Kind of relevant to people
whether their future president happens to also be a sexist pig.
[reporter 2] A new poll reveals how much that tape of Donald Trump is hurting his poll numbers.
Breitbart and Roger Stone are in Donald Trump's head
telling him, "You need to go all-out scorched-earth."
Bill Clinton sexually assaulted innocent women,
and Hillary Clinton attacked those women viciously.
I expect in the fall that many of these women will be speaking out.
Bill Clinton raped me, and Hillary Clinton threatened me.
[reporter] Kathy Shelton was paid $2,500 in May
by a pro-Trump super PAC run by Roger Stone.
If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words and his was action.
After the most recent debate, Clinton leads 49 to 41.
You've got Roger Stone running out there saying that the system is rigged
and that there'll be revolution and blood in the streets.
It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump
is not in charge of the law in our country.
-Because you'd be in jail. -[audience clamoring]
[reporter] FBI director James Comey announced
the bureau is renewing its investigation into her personal e-mail server.
[Trump] Crooked Hillary Clinton.
It's not clear if the tightening in the polls stems from FBI director James Comey's widely condemned disclosure.
Donald Trump has taken this country to the brink.
And tomorrow, voters are likely to take it back.
[reporter 1] Good morning to you. 576 days campaigning,
more than 280 campaign events
and now this historic day is finally here.
Hillary Clinton calls this election the test of our time.
[reporter 2] In Rochester, New York, dozens put "I voted" stickers
on the grave of suffragist Susan B. Anthony
on the day the first woman nominee for president
with a major party was on the ballot.
We're looking at the first woman president of the United States.
Aren't you excited for the first female president?
-No! -I am.
We can't go for Crooked Clinton. We can't go for her.
If Hillary Clinton can run for president, can you do anything?
Yeah.
[reporter] Hillary Clinton is favored to win today.
The polls have all shown her ahead by four points or so.
I'm not fatalist. I just see them with CNN, ABC,
all about how Hillary's gonna win all day.
And I see they're pre-scripting she's gonna win.
They're very hopeful. They're optimistic.
A glass ceiling they're hoping to, symbolically, burst through tonight.
Super excited. I wanna make sure that I'm here to experience history.
What we see from the early returns is that her ground game has really delivered.
Let me tell you this, it is Florida, Florida, Florida.
[reporter] Donald Trump has taken the lead in Florida.
[Stone] I talked to some of my colleagues in Trump Tower just a few minutes ago.
There's a little optimism here.
No one thought it was gonna be this close at this point. Trump can still win this.
[reporter] We have another state to project. It is North Carolina.
Battleground state. It's going to Donald Trump.
I was actually ready to go to bed, uh, then I started seeing the Electoral College come in,
and I'm, like, super psyched.
This is going to be a very close election.
[Stone] I'm seeing these late-breaking trends.
This could hand Trump the presidency. Folks, this is not, by any means, over.
I think there's some real jitters setting in at Clinton headquarters right now.
Wolf, the scene here is so different than it was a few hours ago
when people were happy and relaxed.
This is most unexpected.
It certainly is a huge, huge surprise to so many people out there...
[Todd] I think we all thought it couldn't happen,
that he couldn't do what he did. And guess what?
He may just do it.
[man] Donald Trump has taken the lead. He has 216 electoral votes.
The beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[man] He's pulling ahead of Hillary Clinton. You see it there, 222...
...a number of groups who are likely feeling real fear right now.
You've got women, immigrants, who have been threatened by Donald Trump with deportation.
How do I explain this to my children?
I have Muslim friends who are texting me tonight,
saying, "Should I leave the country?"
America is crying tonight.
I'm not sure how much of America, but a very, very significant portion.
And I mean literally crying.
[crowd chanting] Trump! Trump! Trump!
[reporter 1] This is a very unexpected turn,
and now, his crowd here is saying, "President Trump, President Trump,"
and there is vast celebration going on here.
[reporter 2] Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States.
Ah, yeah. [woman] The basket of deplorables has arrived.
[man] People have talked about a miracle.
I'm hearing about a nightmare.
[crowd chanting] USA! USA! [woman] This is your life now. This is us. This is our country.
[Stone] Stone's Rule.
"Past is fucking prologue."
"Silent majority," "the forgotten Americans."
"I am the candidate of law and order."
It's not me who found this trend. It's those who went before me.
I just saw Trump's ability to utilize it to become president.
This is the manifestation of a dream I've had since 1988.
And I've always thought Donald Trump had the size and the courage and the balls
to become president of the United States.
We're in the age of Stone because the change in our politics,
the rough-and-tumble cutthroat politics, the slash-and-burn of what was just
probably the dirtiest, nastiest campaign in American political history,
are now in vogue.
[man] What message would you have for the viewers of this film
who will loathe you when the credits roll?
I revel in your hatred,
‎I'm waiting! I'm cold!
‎We shall now look ‎at the deep meaning of this text...
‎Stop it and listen to your dad!
‎We worship You and beseech Your aid.
‎Guide us on the path of righteousness.
‎What are you looking at, bastard?
‎Fuck off!
‎You looking at me?
‎Really? You looking at me?
‎Reckon you'll get married, Dounia?
‎Are you mental?
‎Me, get married?
‎Girl got attitude!
‎Maimouna!
‎I want some eye contact, Maimouna!
‎That's it!
‎We're at the Roma camp. ‎Where are you?
‎Been up all night.
‎-Great for school! ‎-No way!
‎Mrs. Labutte, we're out of it.
‎If you're a woman.
‎If you're a woman, I said.
‎If you're not...
‎forget it.
‎Don't help her!
‎Push her, push her!
‎Go, Maimouna, put on a show!
‎Classy...
‎She fell!
‎My, my, my Maimouna!
‎I said, my Maimouna!
‎She thinks she's a princess.
‎Many thanks!
‎Get off!
‎-Go on. ‎-I'm not going in.
‎We might find something sick.
‎We are not alone!
‎We are not alone!
‎-Look at my hands. ‎-What?
‎My hands are made for gold
‎because I'm the queen of the world!
‎Keep moving.
‎Come on.
‎Why do you want to join us ‎in this project?
‎So I can learn new things,
‎venture into the unknown.
‎It's a style ‎completely different from my own.
‎I've always relished a challenge.
‎Next!
‎Hello.
‎A total lack of technique.
‎No emotion, darling, no artistry.
‎It's mechanical, robotic...
‎There's no soul, I don't feel the soul.
‎I don't feel the dance!
‎Come on, let's go.
‎Come on!
‎A can, a bar of chocolate ‎and a lolly, only two euros.
‎I'll have some.
‎Here we go.
‎Chocolate bar...
‎Lighters?
‎-They're crap. ‎-What?
‎They run out too quick.
‎These are the best. ‎What d'you mean, crap?
‎Bics are shit next to these. ‎Just one click...
‎Crickets are the future! ‎They don't even have these in China yet.
‎Maimouna, pack up!
‎Get a move on.
‎The bell's rung.
‎It's door 206, second floor, on the right.
‎-That way? ‎-Okay.
‎-That way? ‎-Okay. ‎I'll give you a little leaflet ‎against racism.
‎No, thanks.
‎"Have a good afternoon."
‎Have a good afternoon. ‎We'll start again, Dounia.
‎But this time, ‎remember something very important.
‎And that is...?
‎The smile. ‎We get it! We've done it ten times!
‎Dounia, please.
‎You got it? ‎I got it.
‎We'll start again.
Okay.
‎Stop acting silly. ‎Stop it, please.
‎With a smile!
‎Very funny, everyone's laughing. ‎This is for an exam!
‎Okay, start.
‎Your back against the backrest ‎and you sit up straight!
‎That's it. Thank you.
‎Can I take your name, please?
‎No, make things difficult for her.
‎There has to be a conflict.
‎I want to see her right away!
‎Deal with it.
‎Okay, I'll stay calm.
‎Listen, madam. ‎That won't be possible because...
‎-Why'd you do that? ‎-I didn't mean to.
‎-I saw you. ‎-I didn't mean to!
‎-No need to shout. ‎-What are you gonna do about it?
‎I'm being polite!
‎Stop now. ‎You're role-playing. It isn't real.
‎We know it isn't real.
‎-Sit down. ‎-Sit down, Jisca.
‎Dounia, you take her place. ‎Go on.
‎So...
‎What can I do for you?
‎Well, already...
‎You've forgotten the first thing.
‎Unforgivable! ‎You've forgotten the smile.
‎The first thing!
‎-The smile! ‎-Calm down.
‎Don't talk to me like that.
‎You could walk this exam. ‎Okay, sit down.
‎My mum's a hostess. ‎She didn't need your shitty exam.
‎Oh, yeah? What are you ‎going to do with your life?
‎Like everyone.
‎This isn't a gig!
‎That's what I'm talking about, ‎making money.
‎You see many millionaire receptionists?
‎Some do very well.
‎They're not millionaires. ‎Neither are you.
‎Can't you see I'm trying to help you?
‎Help us do what? ‎Become society's flunkeys?
‎Rules are necessary.
‎But you're too stubborn. ‎You don't want to learn.
‎So you'll never achieve anything ‎in your life.
‎Go and sit down.
‎What have you achieved?
‎What the fuck have you achieved? ‎Look at your clothes!
‎Go to the principal. That's enough.
‎What do you earn, 1,500 euros a month?
‎-Thirteen hundred! ‎-Eight hundred for your rent.
‎Three hundred for your shopping ‎at Leader Price. ‎She can't afford organic!
‎One hundred euros...
‎One hundred for energy, ‎twenty for Internet...
‎Your package holidays in Turkey...
‎Get out of here! Get out! ‎-Zilch left! ‎-When she gets to class...
‎-Zilch left! ‎-When she gets to class...
‎she's like this!
‎Skint!
‎I don't wanna beg. I've got my pride! ‎Get out of my fucking class!
‎I swear on my mother's life
‎I'll make more cash ‎than you've ever dreamed of!
‎In your entire life!
‎Even in your wildest dreams!
‎I'm never coming back ‎to this shit school! ‎I'll show you!
‎I'm gonna kill her. ‎She's busting my balls.
‎Come back.
‎I love you too!
‎Quitter!
‎Three vodka and oranges.
‎Stop drinking.
‎I'm going soon.
‎In your dreams.
‎I have to revise at Maimouna's.
‎You're not exactly studying for a PhD! ‎You can go to Maimouna's later.
‎They go to bed early.
‎Mum, the boss!
‎Boss...
‎you're so handsome!
‎Where's my drink?
‎Leave it.
‎Look how radiant my daughter is.
‎-Look how beautiful she is. ‎-Mum, you're embarrassing me!
‎Stop it!
‎Get out! Get out!
‎-Out! ‎-What are you doing?
‎Get off my mum! I mean it!
‎I'm not joking, you pig!
‎-Are you mad? ‎-Get out of here!
‎I'll burn your fucking club down!
‎You sick fucking pig!
‎Don't come back!
‎-I'll burn your club down! ‎-Don't come back!
‎You shame me here, at home, ‎everywhere!
‎This is work, so we can eat!
‎Take your mother and go home!
‎Mum, please behave!
‎Do you do it on purpose?
‎Hey, what are you watching?
‎-Leave him. ‎-Look away!
‎Let him look a bit.
‎That's what nightclubs should be like.
‎How much did you score?
‎I was just there on holiday. ‎And I'm gonna go back to live.
‎Thailand's in recession!
‎Not in the sex business. ‎Sex tourism, she's right.
‎No one cares about us. ‎They let us live here like dogs.
‎It's been like that for 2 years. ‎Over there you can earn big.
‎Sex, booze, drugs... Easy money!
‎I'll open a bar with hookers ‎and party while making loads of money!
‎I'll open a little bar,
‎with a Thai guy, lots of masseuses...
‎Sweet!
‎You got it, girl!
‎-You okay? ‎-Yeah.
‎Hey, Alberto! Down, down!
‎Here, pass it to me! Nutmeg!
‎Bianca.
‎All right? ‎I got some Nutella for you.
‎Here.
‎-Thanks. ‎-No problem.
‎Salam. ‎Alaykumu salam.
‎How could he do that to me? ‎It's disgusting!
‎Stop blubbering.
‎No one's dead.
‎Amin. Who's Amin?
‎He's a man, that's all. ‎Disposable, like a Kleenex.
‎If only he were handsome. ‎But he's ugly.
‎I'm so stupid!
‎He told me he loved me.
‎Love?
‎Men don't think with this, ‎but with this!
‎Andrea goes to bed with Rita Hayworth ‎and wakes up with Coco the Clown!
‎The more beautiful you are, ‎the more you suffer.
‎Eat! Starving won't bring him back.
‎I'll get the shower ready for you.
‎-You okay? ‎-Yeah, and you?
‎Haven't seen you around.
‎I've been here, brother.
‎-Were you asleep? ‎-Times are hard.
‎What are you doing here?
‎Shouldn't you be in school?
‎I start at one o'clock today.
‎Where's my daughter?
‎Maimouna's in group A.
‎You come to the mosque ‎when it's empty?
‎Why don't you pray with us anymore? ‎You used to like it.
‎I'd better go, or I'll be late.
‎Take care of your mum.
‎Okay. ‎Paradise lies at the feet of your mother.
‎Shit!
‎What if we wake her up? ‎Ring the bell, who cares?
‎-Are you mental? ‎-She won't hear otherwise!
‎Yeah?
‎Is Rebecca in?
‎Rebecca, for you.
‎What?
‎Can we talk alone? Please.
‎Wait for me.
‎Spit it out.
‎We want to work for you.
‎You think I'm the Job Centre? ‎Piss off!
‎With me, your dope would be safe.
‎Come in.
‎From Samir? ‎You robbed him?
‎No, he left it lying around.
‎You robbed him to get a job with me?
‎Does he know it was you?
‎Nice.
‎You got clitoris... Good!
‎Come tomorrow. ‎I'll give you something to do.
‎Go, "Shit, my mum!"
‎Make it tighter.
‎They're hitting themselves.
‎The star's here!
‎-What's the excuse this time? ‎-I got held up at work.
‎Djigui, your work is here!
‎It's the security dog.
‎You don't have time to change.
‎-It won't be easy like this. ‎-You want easy, go home.
‎-Maybe you're not up to it. ‎-I wouldn't like that!
‎-What did you say? ‎-I don't have time to talk.
‎Not up to it? ‎I'm gonna burn up your audition!
‎Burn it up?
‎He's bigheaded!
‎Wanker!
‎That's not what I want. ‎Do my‎ ‎moves. ‎Okay?
‎It's an audition. You're not in yet.
‎We've been coming for three weeks.
‎And what's going on?
‎I'm leading you ‎towards something different.
‎What I see there isn't...
‎Stop!
‎Did I go to dance school ‎to study ballet? ‎Did I ever tell you that I had?
‎I danced in the street!
‎I didn't have someone ‎sitting at a piano to teach me.
‎This stuff we're doing isn't even organic!
‎There's nothing going on!
‎Can't you see?
‎Why's he making such a fuss? ‎Just do the moves!
‎"I'm from a tough estate..." ‎Yeah, right!
‎The problem with you ‎is that you're afraid.
‎-Afraid? ‎-Yes.
‎-Afraid to come here? ‎-Yes.
‎No, I'm not afraid. ‎I'm not scared of this.
‎Then stop talking and just do it!
‎Go on!
‎If I were the choreographer, ‎I'd twat him. ‎"If you don't like it, piss off!"
‎Longer.
‎Stretch out your arm.
‎Longer. ‎Like that, but more stretched out.
‎Now that he's let himself go, ‎it's more fluid.
‎He was as jerky as a lawnmower!
‎Shit...
‎He was taught a fucking lesson there!
‎I'm gonna teach him a lesson too.
‎-The first to spit on him... ‎-You're mental!
‎What's wrong?
‎-You chicken? ‎-No.
‎-I can see it in your eyes. ‎-No way.
‎-Then spit with me. ‎-Go on, then.
‎-Not even close! ‎-Your turn.
‎Yeah, got him!
‎-Watch this. ‎-No, that's enough.
‎Djigui, what are you doing?
‎Who are you spitting at?
‎Is that you doing that? You fucker!
‎-Go, go! ‎-Wait there!
‎Come back. ‎I'm gonna kill you!
‎Come back here!
‎Djigui!
‎Shit!
‎Come here!
‎I'm gonna fuck you up!
‎Oh, shit!
‎Djigui, come down!
‎Stop it, Djigui!
‎Stay there!
‎Djigui, don't be stupid!
‎He was right. You're scared.
‎-No, Djigui! ‎-Ciao.
‎Djigui, it's not worth it!
‎Stay there!
‎Don't go any further!
‎Go on, faster!
‎Go back!
‎Stop it, this is stupid!
‎Are you shaking?
‎Help!
‎Call security!
‎Don't move!
‎I'm slipping!
‎Give me your hand.
‎Get your feet on that.
‎Now get your other foot on the bar.
‎Push up with your foot!
‎Don't look down, look at me.
‎Look into my eyes ‎and push up on the bar.
‎Okay.
‎You can't fall now.
‎What's the bastard doing here?
‎Leave her alone, she's my girl.
‎I have to pay you back for that dope? ‎Of course you do.
‎I thought we were like brothers. ‎Cash is my only brother.
‎-Cash is your only brother? ‎-That's right.
‎Your shopping.
‎You've hired all the local losers!
‎Thanks.
‎Twenty? I get more from shoplifting!
‎-Thanks, later. ‎-Twenty!
‎-What's your problem? ‎-Dounia! ‎Come back.
‎Can you ride a scooter?
‎Of course.
‎Outta the way!
‎Move, move! You're in my way!
‎It's not me getting in your‎ ‎way!
‎You can't accelerate ‎and brake at the same time.
‎This is what you're like...
‎So you're a mechanic now?
‎I'd forgotten that you were ‎Maimouna the Mechanic!
‎Sorry!
‎-There's broken glass there! ‎-I see it!
‎Go on!
‎-Can't you do a single circuit? ‎-You're doing my head in!
‎Hold the handlebars right.
‎I'm okay, don't touch me! ‎It's all your fault.
‎-Why did you say you could? ‎-Because I can!
‎-Yeah? ‎-Yeah!
‎See you!
‎Yeah, see what you made me do?
‎Where are you going?
‎I'm late. I'll be in trouble.
‎You can't just leave me!
‎It won't even start now!
‎Whose fault is that?
‎I've done it!
‎Why keep trying? ‎You'll never get the hang of it!
‎I do better when you're not here!
‎About time! I could get raped here! ‎"Eleven o'clock, on the dot."
‎Yeah, okay.
‎My foot!
‎That way.
‎Over here.
‎Here.
‎Quiet!
‎It's to keep the jinns away. ‎I can feel them around us.
‎They hide everywhere. ‎In rats, dogs, snakes...
‎They don't like being disturbed.
‎A jinn.
‎A jinn.
‎What you talking about?
‎It's got into you.
‎Shut up!
‎The jinns don't like the full moon.
‎It makes them mad.
‎Doesn't it look like a face?
‎It's God watching us.
‎Like he's got nothing better to do!
‎Insha'Allah.
‎He could tell my dad everything.
‎Don't worry.
‎We're dust in the cosmos. ‎To him, we're microbes.
‎But when you're God, ‎you have to watch over your children.
‎It's written.
‎Yeah, but he hasn't acknowledged us.
‎Yes, he has.
‎He talks to me all the time.
‎When?
‎In my dreams.
‎He gives me weird dreams.
‎Don't you have weird dreams?
‎Mine are always the same.
‎I dream that I'm falling.
‎I try hard to wake up...
‎but I can't.
‎I just keep falling.
‎The further I fall, the more it burns.
‎In the end,
‎I'm no longer in pain or afraid.
‎I just want to crash so it'll end.
‎But it never does.
‎What about me?
‎I'm always here to catch you.
‎-Here. ‎-Thanks.
‎I put everything in the cellar.
‎Keep them. ‎You're in charge of the petrol now.
‎Where do you and your mum live?
‎The Roma camp, with my aunt.
‎By the A3 motorway?
‎You'll catch tetanus there.
‎So I can find you there?
‎I'm putting you and Maimouna ‎in action.
‎You'll take Samir's patch.
‎Use this.
‎If there's any problem, ‎destroy the SIM card.
‎It's got fake names, ‎my number and Samir's.
‎But don't call me. I'll call you.
‎Here.
‎A present.
‎No way, it's an iPhone 6 Plus!
‎See you tomorrow.
‎Why're you spoiling her?
‎And so...
‎-Which ones? ‎-Supras, they're essential.
‎I'll get Supras,
‎I'll get Gazelles,
‎I'll get Reeboks...
‎I'm gonna get ‎the two Adidas there... ‎That's for sure.
‎Navy blue and grey.
‎Maybe some Reeboks, just for home.
‎Let's go and eat ‎at the supermarket.
‎-It's the monkey. ‎-Our pal!
‎Where are you going?
‎Why are you stopping us ‎from coming in?
‎You're not coming in.
‎I saved your life ‎and this is how you thank me?
‎Okay... Noted.
‎Djigui... ‎Where's your tutu?
‎-And your tights? ‎-Don't touch me!
‎My little ballerina!
‎Cut it out! ‎What's going on?
‎Are you flirting?
‎You're not coming in, cockroaches!
‎-I need tampons. ‎-Clear off!
‎No arguing!
‎What's going on here?
‎Are you working or on the pull?
‎Piss off, you little sluts!
‎Dance back to your estate! ‎One, two, three...
‎Maimouna, every 15 minutes,
‎you walk all the way around ‎to see if there's a patrol coming.
‎Drug squad are always ‎in a black Citroën C4,
‎a blue Ford Focus,
‎or a Peugeot 308. ‎Keep your eyes peeled.
‎Hey, pal!
‎How's it going? The family?
‎They're my girls, replacing Samir.
‎Watch that motherfucker!
‎He tries to nick all my punters.
‎Cover Dounia ‎when she goes down to the cellar.
‎I don't want any fuss.
‎Any trouble, ‎I don't know you, you don't know me.
‎We should do a Snapchat story,
‎or no one'll know we're selling.
‎Stop it! We're in with Rebecca now. ‎The cash'll start pouring in!
‎All we're getting here is bored!
‎Try to look ahead a bit.
‎Just imagine, we're in Phuket...
‎Blue sky,
‎turquoise sea, sunshine...
‎Ferrari, my Ferrari!
‎Come on.
‎You go.
‎You're not coming? ‎Okay, I'll go without you.
‎Wait.
‎There, I'm in.
‎Put your Ray-Bans on.
‎Yeah or what?
‎-Do I put my seat belt on? ‎-Yeah.
‎We're off!
‎The wind in our hair. We slay!
‎Such a beautiful day.
‎Not enough hair ‎for it to blow in the wind!
‎Never mind.
‎Shit, watch your speed!
‎-Don't worry. ‎-Take the bend!
‎Watch out in front!
‎Wait, wait, wait!
‎Watch out, watch out!
‎-And straighten up. ‎-Nice one.
‎Hang on...
‎Watch out!
‎A big blond guy ‎with a gorgeous booty.
‎Six foot tall and hot! ‎He's yours. He's noticed us.
‎Colgate smile, a six-pack...
‎Blow him a kiss.
‎Slap his booty!
‎He likes it. Get in.
‎We said get in!
‎Let's drive.
‎And we're driving.
‎-Some music? ‎-Some music.
‎We're at the villa.
‎It's heaving!
‎Splash your cash around!
‎Present!
‎Hey, don't touch the windscreen!
‎Champagne!
‎I know you're there.
‎I can smell you.
‎Fuck, a punter.
‎-What do we do? ‎-Keep cool.
‎You seen Samir?
‎We're Samir.
‎What do you mean?
‎We're Samir. Do you want something?
‎For twenty?
‎Keep an eye out.
‎Got the cash?
‎Here.
‎-What are you doing? ‎-Give me my money back!
‎What are you doing?
‎Open your mouth! ‎Give me my money!
‎You think I'm a bitch?
‎What did I tell you? ‎Give me my money!
‎You're messing with Rebecca!
‎Do you wanna mess with Rebecca?
‎Take your shit dope! ‎Give me my money.
‎Get outta here!
‎-Give me my money. ‎-No, you deal with Rebecca now.
‎Dounia!
‎Fuck, what did he do to you?
‎Listen. ‎Look.
‎There's no one.
‎What the fuck did he do to you?
‎Easy.
‎-Gently. ‎-It's not broken.
‎You did good.
‎Fuck! ‎I can't let my mum see me like this.
‎You can sleep here if you like.
‎Thanks, but I have to get back.
‎Your hair's really long.
‎Why don't you wear it down?
‎You could be beautiful.
‎You don't realise, you're still a kid.
‎I'm not a kid anymore.
‎Those two marks there are his eyes.
‎Hit hard!
‎Go!
‎I can't. ‎Go on!
‎Again! That's it, go for it!
‎What's that?
‎For me?
‎A present.
‎Where's it from?
‎-A collection at the mosque. ‎-For us?
‎Is it Christmas at the mosque?
‎This is for the rent.
‎Where's this money from?
‎I told you, a collection.
‎Cartier, from a collection?
‎Stop worrying. ‎Make the most of it.
‎Here, let me smell it.
‎Swear it's true. ‎I swear.
‎I love you!
‎Lord, forgive me.
‎Hey, you!
‎Where's my money?
‎I don't have time for this.
‎-I can't get that move. ‎-Who cares?
‎-You try it. ‎-I'm not interested!
‎Why do you watch me for hours, then?
‎See...
‎you haven't got it yet.
‎Let go... Let go!
‎What's your game?
‎Now what will you do? ‎That all you got?
‎Where are you going?
‎That turns you on, right?
‎You think I left it here?
‎What are you doing?
‎Let go of me!
‎Let go, I'm not playing around!
‎You're beautiful.
‎Let go of my hair!
‎I'm not joking.
‎Let go!
‎What do you think? ‎Am I getting there?
‎Getting spruced up ‎for the concierge?
‎Busted, Jacky! I knew it!
‎-What are you doing? ‎-I'm in pain.
‎I don't care, get up!
‎-I can't do it. ‎-I don't care, get up!
‎-She should wear... ‎-Shut it and chop!
‎Do it with the kebab box ‎on your head.
‎The police never stop a woman in heels. ‎So keep trying.
‎I'm not doing it just to be nasty.
‎Come on, faster! ‎For fuck's sake!
‎Why do the poor stay poor?
‎Because the rich take it all. ‎No, because the poor don't dare.
‎You have to dare to be rich. ‎Visualise the money and it'll come.
‎I just visualise it, and it'll come? ‎Yes, money is an energy.
‎It's a flow. ‎You have to demand it. ‎"I dare to be rich."
‎I dare to be rich!
‎I dare to be rich!
‎Why are we torturing ourselves? ‎We don't have to do anything.
‎What are you, a beggar? ‎Never lose sight of the money.
‎Do everything to get it.
‎You, walk and visualise. ‎You, chop and visualise.
‎If you can walk in heels, ‎we'll make 100 grand, easy!
‎A hundred grand?
‎-She'll get 100 grand? ‎-Of course.
‎Gotta use your brain.
‎Fetch the iPad.
‎-Who's that? ‎-Reda.
‎My old supplier, ‎grassed me to the filth.
‎Fucker! ‎He's paranoid.
‎He'd suspect his own mum.
‎One night, he was totally out of it ‎and told me where he keeps his cash.
‎One hundred thousand euros, ‎always in his flat.
‎You're gonna get it for me.
‎How? ‎With your heels.
‎He won't be able to resist you. ‎Hot chicks are his weakness.
‎He won't even notice me. ‎Look at them!
‎They're whores.
‎But you look different.
‎He has to take you to his flat.
‎Guys are like dogs. ‎They smell fear, they eat you up.
‎You look scared a lot.
‎No, I'm not scared.
‎See, you're scared. ‎Because you're scary!
‎It's in the eyes.
‎The far-away look.
‎Are you scared? Yes or no?
‎Open your mouth.
‎Open your fucking mouth!
‎Stop it!
‎-What are you doing? ‎-Want me to blow your brains out?
‎To waste you?
‎Are you scared or not?
‎You strike!
‎Then you caress.
‎I couldn't even fit one tit ‎into this top.
‎It's tiny!
‎I could go like this.
‎Fit right in!
‎I come along...
‎Inspection, sir.
‎I hear there's 100,000 euros hidden here.
‎Don't try it on with me!
‎A hundred grand, a hundred grand...
‎-You don't fool me. ‎-He'll run a mile!
‎Come on, Reda.
‎You fancy me, admit it.
‎Stop it.
‎Come on, just a little kiss.
‎What you doing?
‎You're getting too cocky, bastard.
‎Don't call me that!
‎You think you're in daddy's car, ‎or what?
‎You're screwed with Rebecca. ‎If I say we have the top down...
‎We have the top down!
‎Drive!
‎Do you see him?
‎No.
‎Too many baldies!
‎The champagne's flowing! Wicked!
‎Hot bitches here!
‎Almost showing their minges. ‎I'm shocked!
‎There he is.
‎Look.
‎Fuck!
‎The way he's holding her, ‎the dirty old man!
‎Stop it!
‎Wiggle your bum!
‎-He'll never notice you. ‎-Leave me alone!
‎You're mental!
‎I don't believe it.
‎He was looking at you like this...
‎I swear.
‎He lost interest in all the others.
‎He eyed you up ‎like a Big Mac during Ramadan.
‎Where's Samir?
‎What?
‎We told him here.
‎Maybe he's on the other side.
‎No, he's not. We said to wait here.
‎Call him, he can't be far.
‎No answer.
‎It's 3:00 a.m. My mum'll kill me! ‎Don't worry.
‎Don't worry? Let's find a taxi.
‎-Do you love me? ‎-Of course.
‎You like that, eh?
‎You are hot!
‎What you doing with my mum? ‎What? You‎ ‎fucked me!
‎So I fucked your mum!
‎What are you gonna do about it?
‎Put that down!
‎You wanna hit me? Go ahead! ‎You had it coming, bastard!
‎What's got into you?
‎-What's got into you? ‎-Don't talk to your mother like that!
‎Shagging that piece of shit!
‎What the fuck got into you?
‎If I want to screw, I screw!
‎You're never here, ‎now you show up and lecture me?
‎Fucking hell!
‎When will you understand?
‎Because of you I'm the bastard!
‎My whole life ‎I've been called the bastard!
‎I've done nothing wrong!
‎-What's going on? ‎-Grab a jerry can.
‎What are you doing?
‎You're mad! Whose car's that?
‎Samir's mum's!
‎Scumbag!
‎Now I'm fucking you!
‎A little selfie.
‎She's mental. I can't take any more.
‎The fuckers!
‎Go on, film me.
‎What are you doing?
‎Perfect.
‎Leave those cars alone!
‎-Fuck! ‎-What are you doing?
‎I'm talking to you!
‎Let them burn!
‎It's Dounia!
‎It's Dounia!
‎Grab some rocks!
‎What are you gonna do?
‎What are you gonna do? ‎Yeah, I'm here!
‎Hey, let's play police tag!
‎No!
‎Get going, Maimouna!
‎Let's go, Maimouna!
‎The fuckers are behind us!
‎Faster, faster!
‎The police are after us!
‎Smile for the camera!
‎Go, Maimouna!
‎Faster!
‎What are you doing? Slow down!
‎What the fuck are you doing?
‎Get off me!
‎Get the fuck off me!
‎Don't touch me!
‎-Don't touch me! ‎-Stop it!
‎I can't breathe!
‎Let go of me! Let me go! ‎Are you mad? Maimouna!
‎Shut up!
‎What am I to do with you?
‎I'm ashamed of you!
‎I'm always ashamed! ‎You don't even know what dignity is.
‎Or reputation.
‎-The whole neighbourhood... ‎-Easy.
‎Clear off, you! ‎You're not even ashamed!
‎It's all because of you ‎that we're in this shit!
‎I'm sick to death of you, too!
‎You've had no time to raise her, ‎slut that you are!
‎Don't come near my daughter again!
‎Move it! Look at you!
‎Where are you going?
‎You're sober for once, ‎you can find your way home.
‎-Don't... ‎-Let go of me!
‎When did you become a mother?
‎Please, Dounia, I'm sorry. ‎I know I've messed up,
‎I know I've messed up, ‎but I'm going to change.
‎I'll be a good mother to you. ‎Please, sweetheart!
‎Please stay with me. Please...
‎No, Dounia! Stay!
‎Please stay with me!
‎-Drive. ‎-Don't go with them!
‎Get out of the car.
‎Leave my daughter alone!
‎Dounia!
‎Stay with me, ‎stay with your mum.
‎I won't let you go!
‎Leave her alone!
‎Dounia!
‎-Get out of the car! ‎-Speed up.
‎Get out!
‎Seeing your mum, I understand ‎why your head's so fucked up.
‎Why'd you play police tag?
‎What have I taught you?
‎Keep a low profile.
‎You have a record now. ‎Do you want to ruin my business?
‎I warned you about her.
‎Give me the keys to the cellar. ‎Give them to me!
‎-I'll make it right. ‎-Shut your mouth!
‎The estate's crawling with cops ‎because of you.
‎The keys!
‎Here.
‎He fucked my mum! ‎Everyone has!
‎Everyone's fucked your mother!
‎Stop.
‎Fucking stop!
‎I'll pay you back. ‎I swear I'll pay you back.
‎Get the fuck outta here!
‎Drive.
‎It's been an honour working with you.
‎This part is less pleasant
‎because I have to decide. ‎I can't take everyone.
‎That was the deal from the start.
‎Hey, Djigui!
‎On your feet!
‎My girlfriend, she forgot her keys.
‎Her again!
‎-No games! ‎-This is the last audition...
‎I don't give a toss!
‎I want my money back.
‎-Not if you keep shouting. ‎-You're sick!
‎Sit down and watch me.
‎Enjoy the show.
‎Then I might give it back.
‎I'm sure you'll bring me luck. ‎Djigui, we're waiting for you.
‎Feisty! ‎That'll do.
‎Right...
‎Last piece of advice: be yourself.
‎You liked it, eh?
‎-Kind of. ‎-I saw you, you liked it.
‎I don't have time for this. ‎You got my cash?
‎I was picked.
‎Picked for what? ‎For the show.
‎The lead role, for the tour.
‎You can't imagine ‎how my life'll change.
‎Great. You're not taking my money.
‎Here.
‎I didn't steal any of it.
‎I just wanted to lure you down.
‎Can we meet?
‎I got you a ticket for Saturday night.
‎As my guest.
‎Because you bring me luck.
‎How long did you think ‎I'd chase after you?
‎I don't even know your name.
‎Tough.
‎Hang on...
‎-Aren't you hungry? ‎-No.
‎M&Ms.
‎Popcorn.
‎Not hungry, then?
‎Want to slow down a bit?
‎Is this where you always bring ‎girls you want to shag?
‎Only you. ‎The others aren't such hard work.
‎Shall we go?
‎You think it's weird, ‎a guy who dances?
‎When I dance...
‎I let everything around me ‎come inside.
‎And I don't cheat.
‎Dance doesn't lie.
‎It's sacred.
‎What's your name?
‎Won't you tell me?
‎I won't let you go until you tell me.
‎Tell me.
‎Tell me your name.
‎Stop!
‎-Tell me. ‎-Stop!
‎Dounia... Dounia!
‎My name is Dounia!
‎I don't know what you did...
‎to that motherfucker Reda. ‎Get in!
‎-He was looking for you at the club. ‎-How's life, Jacky?
‎Here, call him.
‎Yeah.
‎-Hello? ‎-Yeah, it's Zohra.
‎Zohra, ‎my princess! ‎I'm glad you called.
‎What are you doing Saturday?
‎Fancy going to a gig? ‎A shit-hot new rap group.
‎I got stuff to do.
‎What are you doing? ‎Getting your revenge?
‎-You said to strike. ‎-And then caress!
‎Are you there, Zohra?
‎Yeah.
‎I'd really like to see you.
‎Those other girls ‎were my mates' slags.
‎Okay, you're on.
‎Saturday at 7:00. ‎I'll text you the address.
‎Okay, ciao.
‎Stop sulking.
‎I know I'm hard on you. ‎I know I made it tough.
‎But it's because you've got potential.
‎You've proved it.
‎Here.
‎Your money.
‎That's peanuts.
‎We'll have that fucker Reda, ‎eh, Jacky?
‎Yeah, we'll have him.
‎We'll be rich.
‎I thought I'd never see you again.
‎I'm here now. ‎My mum's put a spell on us.
‎I swear she has!
‎And my dad ‎won't even look at me anymore. ‎I disgraced him.
‎It was my fault, I'm sorry.
‎Sorry.
‎I'm here. ‎I'm here.
‎Lie down.
‎What did you do today?
‎Nothing.
‎What's wrong?
‎I'm scared.
‎I'm scared too.
‎All beautiful for me?
‎Well, for the show.
‎It's all sorted.
‎A front-row seat.
‎Not way up there.
‎Will you come?
‎I'll be there.
‎I'll take your jacket.
‎Where you going?
‎Come here.
‎You come here.
‎Don't you fancy me?
‎Yes, I do.
‎I'm going for a shower.
‎Make yourself comfortable.
‎I'll be waiting.
‎Can I help you?
‎I was looking for cigarettes.
‎I don't keep them here.
‎You're beautiful.
‎What were you looking for?
‎As you wish.
‎"The Konis Dancers."
‎You should have gone.
‎No way!
‎No way!
‎OK? U back at the estate?
‎Yeah, Maimouna...
‎It's me.
‎I wanted to tell you I did it.
‎I did it!
‎I left your share in the hiding place.
‎I just wanted you to know... ‎I'm leaving.
‎But I'll be back soon.
‎I miss you.
‎I love you.
‎-Come back or I'll hurt her bad! ‎-Don't come, Dounia!
‎-Come for your friend! ‎-Don't come!
‎Keep quiet!
‎Not a sound. Shut it!
‎She's crafty. ‎You think she'll show up?
‎-Shut your mouth! ‎-She won't come.
‎Shut your mouth, I said. Shut it!
‎It's me, let me in!
‎Where is she?
‎Trying to fuck me?
‎You okay?
‎-Who told you to untie her? ‎-Keep still!
‎She's got her money back!
‎It's not all here.
‎Where's the rest?
‎What did you do with my money?
‎I'm talking to you!
‎-You whore, just like your mum! ‎-Shut it!
‎Don't tell me to shut it! ‎You little whore!
‎Where is it? Where's my money?
‎Where's my money? ‎Please tell them.
‎Shut it, you!
‎What did you do with it?
‎-What are you doing? ‎-No, wait!
‎Get outta my way!
‎No, don't!
‎Tell them, Dounia, please! ‎You're mad!
‎You shut it!
‎Is this what you want? ‎You wanna go up in flames?
‎Where's my money?
‎I'm talking to you!
‎Dounia, tell her! ‎You don't want to die for money!
‎Stop playing the gangster! ‎I'm gonna burn you!
‎Please, Rebecca.
‎Go on, do it.
‎Are you scared?
‎I can see you are.
‎-I'll go to her mum's. ‎-No, you won't!
‎It's at her mum's! ‎Go, hurry!
‎No, don't!
‎It's my money! Don't go there!
‎-Shut it! ‎-Don't go!
‎It's my money! My money!
‎You're gonna die, you bastard!
‎My name's Dounia!
‎My name's Dounia!
‎My name's Dounia!
‎Never call me bastard again!
‎My name is Dounia!
‎Dounia!
‎Dounia, watch out!
‎Fuck!
‎Samir!
‎Samir, come back!
‎Help! Samir!
‎Give me your top! ‎Help!
‎Here, quick!
‎Help! Help!
‎Help!
‎Please! We're in here!
‎It's Gervais! Call for help!
‎Call the fire service! ‎Call them, quick!
‎Hurry!
‎Quick, Maimouna!
‎Gervais!
‎-Give me your hand! ‎-Go, Maimouna!
‎Hurry!
‎Quick, Maimouna!
‎I can't get through.
‎Rebecca, quick!
‎Push!
‎Dounia, hurry up!
‎-Go! ‎-No.
‎You're covered in petrol. ‎Just go!
‎I'm staying here!
‎-Get out! ‎-I'm staying with you.
‎-I'm not going. ‎-Go!
‎I don't want to go!
‎I'm staying here! ‎No, let go of me!
‎Let go!
‎Maimouna... ‎Come here.
‎Come here.
‎Breathe. ‎Don't worry, I'm here with you.
‎I'm here with you, okay?
‎You hear that?
‎They're coming!
‎They're gonna save you.
‎See, I told you!
‎Those bastards won't come in.
‎What do you mean? ‎Go and get them!
‎They're afraid of getting attacked.
‎Maimouna,
‎I'll go and get them, okay? ‎I'm scared!
‎I'll be right back. Breathe! ‎Stay with her.
‎Look at me.
‎Look this way!
‎Dad! ‎Dad!
‎Come here!
‎-Please! ‎-We can't intervene.
‎She can't get out, she's all alone. ‎We have to wait for police back-up.
‎It's burning! ‎I can't do anything. ‎They're my orders.
‎Orders, to let people die?
‎-She can't get out! ‎-We can't.
‎What if it were your child?
‎You throw rocks at us. ‎We're not allowed.
‎We won't throw rocks, ‎I swear! Please!
‎-Do your job! ‎-Dounia, quick!
‎Why aren't you coming? ‎There's fire everywhere!
‎Everywhere! ‎She'll die!
‎She's going to die!
‎No!
‎It's not happening!
‎No, Maimouna!
‎No, I'm begging you, no...
‎Forgive me.
‎Forgive me, forgive me...
‎It's all your fault!
‎Dounia.
[woman] Dr. Harber, before we're live, I just wanted to say thank you for choosing me.
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
[woman] The rich history you have with other journalists...
[Harber] I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.
Now, don't fuck it up.
[woman 2] Fifteen seconds.
People trust you... for decades have valued you.
I think that's because people value the truth.
Right, but don't you think your discovery was just... too dangerous
to share with the world?
Look, this has been my life's work for over 40 years.
There's nothing willy-nilly here.
After much discussion, much debate, we all came to the same conclusion.
-Which is? -Which is, once you explore
all scientific possibilities, and you come to a consensus,
how can you keep a discovery so vital to our existence a secret?
And that discovery...
You proved the existence of an afterlife.
I prefer to call it a new plane of existence.
I can't comment on terminology like "soul" and "heaven" and "afterlife,"
but what I can say with scientific certainty is that once the body dies,
some part of our consciousness leaves us and travels to a new plane.
Your machine was able to capture brain wavelengths
on a subatomic level, leaving the body after death.
-Is that...? -That's correct.
Where do those wavelengths go?
My point is, a new plane of existence is out there.
Yes, that is no longer in dispute.
But you can't tell us what that is exactly.
When you see a train leave the station...
do you need to know where it's going to understand that you saw it leave?
It's a tough pill to swallow.
At one point, so was the Earth being round.
But, Dr. Harber, why did it take you six months to address us?
Where have you been?
It seems to me that I invited you here, to my home.
Yes, you did. Thank you.
But... we only received that invitation
after the suicide toll had rapidly reached a million.
And during that time, celebrities, athletes,
even a close colleague of yours, all ended their lives.
Which is why I agreed to sit with you and try to calm the waters.
Okay.
I wanna ask you the question
that everybody watching right now is probably wondering.
Do you feel responsible for all those people killing themselves?
No.
-That's it? -That's it.
[man] Thank you, Dr. Harber... for my fresh start.
[woman 1] Andy, no!
Andy!
-Andy! -[woman 2] Oh, no.
[woman 1] Oh, God!
-Why would you do that? -[woman 2] Somebody call 911.
[woman 1] Help! Some....
Call help, please.
Right now. Get someone here.
My God!
Why would you do that?
Oh, God.
Turn those cameras off.
[man] Welcome back to our coverage of the two-year anniversary of the Discovery.
We'll be revisiting the touchstone moments of the past two years,
with retrospectives all weekend long.
Hard to believe that it's been a year and a half
since Thomas Harber's first and only post-Discovery interview ended suddenly with an on-air suicide.
ended suddenly with an on-air suicide.
Since then, the worldwide suicide toll has skyrocketed to staggering levels.
Over four million people have taken their lives,
attempting to "get there."
As for Dr. Thomas Harber, he has not made a public appearance
since that infamous post-Discovery interview.
Completely off the grid--
[woman] I was listening to that.
I was listening to that.
I'm sorry, I thought-- I thought that I was alone.
It's off-season. Why the fuck are you going to this dreary island?
Well, you're going there.
Hi.
Hi.
Are you one of those lunatics
who just sits next to a complete stranger in an empty movie theater?
You look so familiar to me.
It's possible we've met, but you don't have a memorable face.
Okay. [chuckles]
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. I didn't mean that. I just...
The water. I'm just a little seasick.
That's weird. It's your lucky day. I don't normally carry these around.
-Vertigo. -I'm not dizzy.
You can't treat vertigo, just the effects. That's for nausea.
Do I look like the kind of girl who's just gonna take a pill from some strange guy?
Fair enough.
Isla. My name's Isla.
I don't look like an Isla, though.
Your first three years, you look like whatever name you're given,
then by four, you either settle into your name or you just...
-What about you? -What?
What's your name?
Oh, uh, Will Stevenson.
[mouths] Will.
What?
I'm just trying to see if you look like your name.
-What's the verdict there? -I don't know.
It's too early to tell.
You know, Will is just such a, like, "Will" name.
You're really something.
Happy second Discovery anniversary, Will.
They said on the news they're expecting like a whole slew of suicides today.
People trying to get there for the anniversary.
I heard something about that.
Did you see that video of those dumb cheerleaders
taking pills on the 50-yard line?
I just can't get behind the concept of suicide groups.
It's so... disingenuous, you know? It just feels so weak.
-You don't believe in the Discovery? -No, I don't believe in suicide groups.
The Discovery is-- I mean, the proof is overwhelming.
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming. Proof should be definitive.
So, you don't believe.
I don't believe the way everybody else does. No, I don't.
-And how's that? -I'm a neurologist.
Three months ago, I had a patient, really young,
found out that she had brain cancer. Very sad.
She reacted to that diagnosis
as though I'd handed her a fucking winning lottery ticket.
It wasn't because she hoped that maybe she was going someplace better.
It was because the Discovery made her think that it was guaranteed.
Well, yeah. Death used to be something we just had to live with,
and now it's a convenient way to escape pain. That's okay.
That's okay? Another plane of existence, maybe.
Who knows? But I look around, I see a lot of people jumping out of planes
hoping they're gonna grow wings.
Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive.
They don't exist in the same space.
What?
When I was five, I had an accident, and I died for about a minute.
When I was resuscitated, I told my parents that I saw something.
Flashes. A little boy.
Me, maybe, or my brother.
I felt stranded...
Stranded where?
This empty beach. It doesn't matter. It was a dream.
It was a dream that I embellished after I woke up.
Why would you make all that up?
I think it's our instinct to search for meaning,
and when there is none, it's our instinct to create meaning
and we just... lie. We lie to ourselves.
You are so annoying. Has anyone ever told you that?
Yeah, they have.
Ugh. Thank God we only have a minute left together
before we're strangers again.
You think it's gonna be a minute this time of year? You're crazy.
Crazy, but right.
That's the attractive-girl component and I didn't factor that in.
[Isla] You'd better work on your math.
Hey!
For whatever it's worth, I think you do look like an Isla.
How many of us have you met?
-I got it. -No, I got it, man.
Well, I don't want to die before we get there, Toby.
-What's going on over here? -Eddie.
-Wait, Eddie Iodice? Eddie died? -Mm-hmm. Yeah, just to get there.
Just to fucking get there.
Guy pulled a Marilyn Monroe,
downed a whole bottle of pills right there in his bedroom.
Good dude, too.
-Real pity. -You didn't wanna go to the service?
Go to the...? I would rather stick my dick in a wood chipper
-than go to another fucking funeral. -Got it.
You know, I'm not as stupid as you might think.
When you called the other day and I told you
that Dad had built something new...
after that conversation...
suddenly you wanted to come home.
-You're sounding just as paranoid as him. -[chuckles]
[Toby] Dad said he needed to change things up.
People knowing our address was too dangerous.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you on the phone,
but we don't trust phones now.
Here we are.
Off to see the wizard.
[Will] What the fuck is this place?
Uh, it used to be a summer camp for "troubled youths."
Which I never really understood, because if they're bad kids,
why would they deserve a fun summer? You know?
But then it shut down and Dad bought it.
What do you think?
[Will] I think it's completely insane.
Well, the truth is we just needed a lot more space to house things.
House what things?
[Toby] These people were all affected by the Discovery.
Some of them arrived here after two or three failed suicide attempts.
We gave them a home,
something to live for in this life, a reason to contribute.
Oh, uh, real quick.
Just FYI, FBI-type thing, protocol is no cell phones.
-Yeah, okay. Let's go. -Yeah.
Hey, don't worry.
[man] This is truly thrilling.
I can only compare it to the model train set
you let me assemble by myself on my birthday.
[woman] Cutting it a little close.
[Toby] Oh, well, you know me. Pins and needles, needles and pins.
These goddamn machines.
-Who the hell's that? -His other son just returned.
Surprisingly taller than I remember.
Good to see you again, Cooper.
Will, Lacey. Lacey...
That went well.
Where's Dad?
-Is he dead? -No, of course not.
He is now.
-[Lacey] Fifteen seconds. -Dad?
Take it easy. They're just running some tests.
-It's all routine. -Ten seconds.
Paddles charged... and ready.
See, they're recharging the body to reboot the brain.
The longest he's ever officially under is, like, 60 seconds.
So, Dad is now killing himself and electroshocking back to life.
No.
Kind of.
But you're... You're looking at this all wrong.
You're wearing whatever the opposite of... What is it? Rose-colored glasses.
That's what you're wearing.
Shit-colored glasses.
Anyway, you shouldn't worry,
because all of this is being closely monitored and controlled.
And we both know you've always been slightly skeptical of everything.
Dad started a cult.
-No. -Can you not see that? This is a cult.
All the way down to these followers in different-colored jumpsuits.
No, no, no. There's no hierarchy here, Will.
Dad calls it... distinctions in clearance.
-That's all. It's not a cult. -It should be different. Straitjackets.
You're the one that wanted to come back here
for whatever reason. Right?
Now, that, right there, is the million-dollar question.
Welcome back, Will.
You mind telling me something?
What are you doing back here?
I'm here because I want you to stop it.
I'm asking you just to put an end to all this.
How would I do that?
Say that you were wrong.
Take it all back.
I can't take it back, Will, because it's the truth.
Who knows better than you?
You were the inspiration for this. Aren't you curious?
Please, don't say that. That's not...
-I wasn't. -Ah, but you were. Hang on.
"Therefore, it is my belief
consciousness should be considered as another state of matter."
-Please don't. -Hang on.
I'd like to get to this other part. It gets good.
"Properties of consciousness arise from the physical laws
that govern our universe."
-I was wrong. -You don't believe that.
We were wrong, Dad.
We were wrong because a lot of people died.
And a whole lot more people are gonna kill themselves...
while you experiment here in this ridiculous fortress.
So, just slamming on the brakes of 40 years' work?
I'd be saying I'm responsible.
Maybe you are.
So, you think I've gone too far?
Well, I don't think I've gone far enough.
We opened the door for these people, Will.
They know it's there.
Now we have to show them what's behind it.
Isla!
Isla!
Isla!
Isla!
[Will] Oh, fuck!
-What are you doing? -What's your problem?
Come on. Stand up. Get up.
-[Will] Why are you doing this? -[Isla] None of your fucking business.
You sat there on that fucking ferry and had a conversation with me,
knowing you were gonna do this.
You were supposed to be the last person I ever spoke to.
You don't get to just change that!
Ah. You're not even emotional about dying.
I'm not emotional about anything.
[Toby] I'm just concerned...
that this will all be perceived unfavorably by some.
[Will] She was going to catch pneumonia, Toby.
[Toby] I still don't know what you want me to do with her.
[Will] You told me that you take in people who need help. She needs help.
She still can't just stay here. We have rules.
Then can we make an exception... in her case, please?
We're talking about somebody's life.
We have no idea if she will attempt or try to...
Kill myself again?
You can say it. I know what happened. I was there when you ruined it.
She and I have been getting along great.
We still have rules.
She has to talk to Dad, and she has to take the questionnaire.
What's the questionnaire?
-Um... -Can we be...?
Will, you have a visitor.
Your dad is Thomas Harber?
[Harber] So, nobody but the conductor, which is me, is gonna know your answers.
Everything is completely discreet here.
And now Lacey will be giving us some privacy.
It used to be about global exploration, you know, discovering new land,
and then it was space travel.
Shining a light on the dark corners of the universe.
And now it's exploring what comes after this life.
Seeing what's next. How old are you?
[man on recording] You are all part of the same thing.
Cells in a body.
Waves in the ocean.
The soul isn't young or old.
[Harber] Do you accept the fact that time is a nonlinear illusion created by man?
Pass. I don't know what that means.
There are no right or wrong answers to this questionnaire.
-Then why do you bother giving it? -That's a good response.
[Harber] Okay, greatest ability... and most disappointing weakness.
[Isla] I guess I'm good at seeing what makes somebody tick.
Understanding who they really are.
[Harber] Weakness?
I'm able to understand them, but I'm not able to care about them.
If somebody mentions "subconscious" to you, what do you think?
-Memory. -Dig deeper.
-Hidden memory. -Would you say that you suppress emotions?
I don't really like talking about myself like this.
You don't have to like it. We think about ourselves every day.
Everything is from our own perspective. So, as much as you may not want
to indulge yourself in looking at your most inner thoughts,
they're there. Make no mistake. They are there.
[Harber] Do you believe in a soul? If not, close your eyes.
Great. Let's just say a soul does exist. Where in the body do you think it'd be?
I think if there's a soul, it would belong in the brain.
Now, that's interesting. Most people say the stomach.
But I like that you didn't.
[Harber] Have you ever experienced sudden loss?
Yes.
And what aspect of regaining normalcy after losing someone...
was the most difficult?
Inanimate objects, maybe? Like...
my coffee table. I've had it for years
and I've probably looked at it a million times, but after he--
Familiar objects just became distorted and unfamiliar.
I started to hate my ceiling fan, my cereal bowl, my tea kettle.
[Harber] Okay, last question.
Are you legitimately suicidal?
If you knew what came after... this life...
do you think it would affect your decision-making
or maybe even make you change your mind?
Maybe. Knowing could change things.
How'd you know this is where you'd be staying?
I found our old bed.
Yeah, I see that.
And you should thank me... by the way, because
I fought long and hard to keep old faithful here.
How's Isla?
Oh... That's actually why I'm here. Will, she's dead.
No, she's not. She's not dead. That was a bad joke.
Um... But the questionnaire is all wrapped up.
She can stay.
Yeah, good. She needs to be looked after. She could try again.
I don't think that's going to happen, Will.
Because tonight...
everything changes.
We finally unveil it.
What is "it," Toby?
Dad wanted me to invite you to a little gathering tonight,
just a select group.
Boy, this is nothing like our old house, huh?
It sounds to me a lot like you're advocating murder.
I'm not advocating murder. I'm just pointing out that most people
don't look at ending somebody else's life the way they do their own.
[sighing] Where is he?
It's about to happen.
I can't tell when you're talking to me or that. It's really annoying.
Anyways, what I'm saying is, people are killing themselves to get there.
At a certain point, they'll use the same logic to kill somebody else,
'cause they're just sending them somewhere else, right?
Finally, he's here.
And he is not wearing the temp jumpsuit I had left for him.
We're programmed to process our experiences
as having a beginning and an end, when, in reality... doesn't exist.
It's just one long, drawn-out middle.
Some of you are newer than others,
but I wanted to create a select group that could see what it is that I built.
But before we do that, I'd like to take a moment
and have you join me in... bowing our heads...
And let your subconscious... take you somewhere else.
I'm sort of amazed that you get swept up in this, this easily.
You don't strike me as a say-your-prayers type.
Just because somebody doesn't believe in God doesn't mean they can't pray.
What kind of an atheist talks to God?
Why did you give me a phony, bullshit last name?
It wasn't phony. It was my mother's maiden name.
Where is she?
She's dead.
How did she die?
Because of my dad.
Let us come back into this moment.
I now offer you the opportunity...
to see the afterlife.
I can now record where we go.
[Cooper] Please, uh... get these back to us
at your earliest convenience.
And again, these living quarters are just temporary
until we can find you a more suitable room.
When I first moved here, I slept on a cot in the kitchen.
-Glamorous. -[chuckles]
I'm supposed to be at the bottom of the ocean, so this should be fine.
Can I have a pen?
Nondisclosure agreement.
Well, considering the sensitivity, it's a fairly standard document.
Could we have the room for a second, please?
[Cooper] You remember that awful week when we slept on the cot by the fridge?
My back sure hasn't forgotten.
-[Will] Hey. -Mm.
So... I know that that device is very compelling. Um...
-Can we talk about it for a second? -I'm not allowed to talk about it,
'cause I just signed a nondisclosure agreement.
So, your dad's a little weird. Who cares? It doesn't make him wrong.
I mean, Poe fucked his cousin. It didn't make him any less a writer.
I wanna see if that machine does what he thinks it does.
Well, what if it did?
How would that change things?
You don't go on vacation without looking at the brochure first.
Hey. Uh... I'm sorry. Were you sleeping?
I'm standing.
Well, yeah.
That's just something you're supposed to say, I guess.
Since you're up, mind coming downstairs and taking a look at something for me?
Yeah, sure.
-[Isla] Where are you guys going? -It's nothing. Don't worry about it.
When he flatlines, think of it as a light bulb turned off by a switch.
Flip it on, flip it off.
But going under, hooked up to the new device,
you're not just flipping a light switch.
You're essentially detaching the entire bulb.
So, I'd say that if you go under again...
you're coming back with next to no brain functionality.
I'm sort of surprised it hasn't happened already.
I know you wanted to be first, but if you don't come back, what's the point?
We just go back to the drawing board. Right?
I mean, it could still work, we just need to find a new way to...
We need a cadaver.
Okay. Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Where do you guys plan on getting a corpse?
I have a corpse idea.
-Am I being rude? -Huh?
-Am I being rude? -No.
-Care to... listen? -Sure.
Crunchy groovy grooves. Serene nights.
-Can I ask you something? -Mm-hmm.
Will mentioned what happened to your mom earlier.
That she killed herself?
Not exactly.
So, she was trying to get there?
No, that was a good couple years before the Discovery.
Yeah.
How you doing?
In the midst of life, I am in death.
That was weird. I was just wondering if you could help me out.
My, uh, cousin, Billy...
he's gone missing.
And it being the two-year anniversary of the Discovery,
we're all just a little worried.
Really worried.
We got three John Does in this week. How long has he been missing?
Nope. No. No Billy here.
Bummer.
Would have made my life a hell of a lot easier.
Sorry, that was insensitive.
They just got me running rampant here. I'm doing the job of five people.
Off-season cutbacks and whatnot? Yeah.
Can I give you a description... of Billy?
That way if he does... come in, you can keep an eye out for him.
Of course.
Let's go to my office.
[Toby] Hey, so, just curious...
I'd like to point out you're reading off a laundry list of corpse requirements.
Aneurysm, that won't work.
It'd be nice if you could help me, seeing as we're breaking and entering.
Like a real, like, pouty-type face.
And then, um...
he's got a birthmark on, uh...
Let's see. On his right elbow. You're not writing any of this down.
Well, I think I've got more than I need to go on here, so...
But we... We haven't even gotten to the lower half of his body.
Don't you think it's weird how these people were alive a few hours ago?
They had fears and desires, they could exercise?
I don't think it's weird. I think it's fucking sad.
-Maybe they went someplace better. -Maybe they went someplace worse.
Maybe they went someplace that we can't even begin to comprehend.
All the more reason to see what your dad's machine shows us.
Shit.
What?
"Fifty-two, massive coronary."
Will...
meet Pat Phillips.
Pat Phillips, this is Will.
I don't like that creepy room Cooper put me in.
I'm gonna sleep in your room tonight.
Top or bottom?
We could talk, you know.
When I'm nervous, I talk too much or not at all.
Well, you're safe here.
I mean... nothing leaves the bunk beds.
When I first got here and they gave me that jumpsuit,
it had a V etched on it. I wonder what that stood for.
"Visitor," maybe?
Is that a guess?
That was a pretty good guess.
It's like one of those really obvious answers
that only seems obvious after you find out about it.
Were you really smart growing up? I bet you were.
I was told that I demonstrated an early ability to recognize spatial patterns,
whatever that means.
I always took it as one of those things a teacher tells to a parent
to make them feel better about their shitty kid.
Like, "Gordon is very good at drawing circles.
Gordon draws circles at a more advanced level than the other children."
These bunk beds really worked out well,
'cause they spared me the awkwardness of having to tell you I'm not gonna fuck you.
Sorry, all I heard was something about circles and not fucking me.
I don't wanna be the only fucked up person on this bunk bed, Will.
Maybe... tell me about your mom now.
There's not much to tell. She killed herself.
On their anniversary.
How did she do it?
She made them dinner,
and... my dad didn't even come out of his office.
If he'd even just hinted that he gave a shit, I mean, who knows?
But he couldn't be bothered. So, she went upstairs...
took a bath instead and, uh...
Yeah, the next morning I found her in the tub.
And so, you left?
Yeah, I had to. I couldn't be around it. I knew.
It's like everything that was recognizable sort of instantly became unrecognizable.
Sometimes I feel like I'm taking someone else's spot and then I feel sad.
How do you mean?
Like, being here alive is a waste
because... I don't enjoy it, I'm not happy or grateful...
and I'm taking a spot away from someone who
maybe would've gotten something more out of it.
Yeah.
I guess I don't think it works that way.
Here's something I haven't heard anyone talk about.
Do animals have an afterlife?
Bunnies, kittens, pigs, monkeys. What happens to them after they die?
I mean, I feel like they really deserve an afterlife.
Do they have their own animal afterlife?
And if they do, is it subdivided by species?
Because it feels like something as profound as an afterlife
shouldn't practice segregation.
And what happens to a child?
Hold hands till we fall asleep?
This doesn't seem entirely fair.
Yeah, okay.
Lacey?
Okay, Toby?
Did you hit...? Hit it again.
Again.
Hit it again.
I'm hitting it.
Hit it again.
-You're gonna fry the body. -Toby, hit it again.
Again.
Hit it again.
Again. Hit it again.
Is this just a setback or...?
I'm really not sure.
Are you gonna see him?
Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it?
[Pat] I'm sorry... I can't.
[woman] Of course you can't. Story of your fucking life.
Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.
-Hey. -Hey.
What are you doing with my body?
Your body, uh, is to be cremated at noon, so, I'm getting it ready.
We do still have a little time to prep a redo.
Redo? Guys, come on. You almost fried the body.
You do this redo, you're gonna cremate him early. All right?
Toby, rustle up a van. Will's right.
It's good.
Seeing you back in the labs again, it's good.
It's where you belong.
Toby, I want you to locate me a new corpse, immediately.
Hey. Can I ask you something?
-Okay. -How'd you end up here?
Why?
I came home and found my dad and my sister hanging in my living room.
To get there.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. They didn't want me to come.
Can you imagine feeling abandoned
'cause your dad left you out of the family suicide?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing, I'm just... I'm processing.
I mean, do you ever get out of your head even for one minute?
Let's do an experiment.
Look at me and tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
I'm driving.
Okay.
I don't know you very well.
I think you're beautiful, and alive, and if you killed yourself,
it wouldn't just be sad, it would be a tragedy.
Shut up.
-You want the head or the feet? -Head.
Okay.
"Oh, hey, Isla. What are you up to?"
"Oh, nothing much, Jim.
I'm just... lugging a corpse through a parking lot."
-Why'd you go with "Jim"? -Don't be jealous of hypothetical Jim.
Believe me, if hypothetical Jim makes you not wanna kill yourself,
I can be supportive.
Do we just leave it here?
Believe it or not, it's my first time returning a corpse, so... I'm improvising.
Hi, yeah, um, I was just driving by and this is kind of weird,
but there seems to be, like, a dead body laying in your parking lot.
-That was pretty good. -Shut up. Get out.
-I'm saying you're doing a good job. Fine. -Stop it. Sorry. Yeah, no, bad...
Bad reception on the island. Um...
Yeah, the body seems to be abandoned, and... I don't know.
Unless, of course, you guys are playing some sort of fucked-up scavenger hunt.
Okay. Yes, thank you. Bye.
-How'd that go? -It went really well.
Okay. You're, like, weirdly good at that.
-Oh. -Here they are.
-[Isla chuckles] -They're pretty confused.
What do you think they're thinking?
I don't know, but I think Pat Phillips has had a really tough few days.
We're both going to hell.
Yeah. Whatever the afterlife is, I guess.
I don't know. Just stupid.
Are you gonna see him?
Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it?
[Pat] I'm sorry... I can't.
[woman] Of course you can't. Story of your fucking life.
Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.
Can I borrow your truck? Just for... I have to go get some stuff.
[woman] As far as our records indicate,
we've had 23 patients with the name Phillips on file.
-How accurate are your records? -Accurate.
I would love to see that list.
Mm. I'm sure you would.
What the fuck?
Are you looking for something?
Maybe you can help me. Um...
-Did there used to be a hallway here? -Used to.
They did a little remodeling.
Took their sweet-ass time with it, too.
I'm sorry, how long ago was that remodel?
About a decade ago.
[Isla] Hey.
-Hey. -Where have you been?
This is, uh... This is interesting.
Okay, thank you, Toby.
Thank you, my boy.
Well, hello to you all.
As always, it's a pleasure.
When you all first got here, you...
You used this, uh, piece of equipment.
The questionnaire.
And your answers are what allowed you to stay here,
so, basically... a trust was built.
But lately, I'm beginning to wonder
if perhaps we're getting just a little too comfortable here.
There's a lot of loose talk going on.
And it makes me think that we just might be losing a little focus.
Lacey, would you join me, please?
-What's going on? -It's okay. Relax.
Would you like to tell us how long you've been here?
Um... just over a year.
Just over a year. You were one of the first.
How have you been treated? Have you been treated well?
-Have I been good to you? -You've been wonderful.
-Why are you talking to me like this? -I've been wonderful.
If I've been wonderful, then why are you telling your peers about the device,
and particularly... why are you saying it failed?
Speak up.
It's okay.
I just told one person.
It slipped out when I had mentioned how the new girl was invited.
[Harber] You mean Isla.
You were displeased when I invited her here, weren't you?
It's just that some people who have been here much longer weren't asked.
Tell everyone where I found you.
Thomas.
It's okay.
This is a safe place.
In the woods.
Go on.
I had a gun.
And where was that gun aimed?
At my chest.
Right next to your heart.
Usually, it's the head... or the barrel goes into the mouth.
I don't know that I've ever seen it done that way before.
I'm sorry.
Please don't lose faith in me.
"Faith."
Oh, God. I have such contempt for that word.
Show me someone who relies on faith
and I'll show you someone who's given up control
over whatever it is they believe.
Sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you.
Thomas, please.
Pack up your belongings. Say your goodbyes.
That was a hell of a show out there.
Come on, Will.
You think I don't know a lot of this is bullshit?
You give meaning to people who think they have no more reason to live.
The jumpsuit, the chain of command, the theatrics.
It gives them purpose. And I care about them.
Yeah. Someone should tell that to Lacey.
You... You can pretend all you want
that the reason you left was because you stopped approving of my work.
Work, by the way, that we did together.
But I think we both know this was never about the Discovery for you.
-It was always about your mother. -Yes, of course it was about Mom for me.
Just because you wanna pretend like Mom did not happen...
doesn't mean that I'm going to.
-Hey. Can I show you something? -What?
-Just come with me. Please. -Sorry.
[Isla] Wait.
-What is this? -That's what I'm trying to figure out.
-You were gonna keep this from me? -No, I'm... I'm showing you now.
And I was afraid of what you might do.
All right, so, the afterlife... This is the afterlife?
How can it be the afterlife if we're in the same parking lot in that recording?
Then what is it?
My theory is that my father invented something that records memory.
You've heard him go on and on about the subconscious.
I understand that you wanted this to be something different.
The proof is overwhelming that that's a Pat Phillips memory.
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming. It should be definitive.
Where the fuck are we going?
[Will] If what we're seeing on that video happened in real life,
I'm gonna find out exactly when.
Since this hospital opened, there have been 23 patients named Phillips.
But based on the model of his truck,
I can eliminate any Phillips from before the year 2000.
Yeah, but even after 2000, doesn't that leave a lot of names?
That hospital room doesn't exist anymore,
so, we can also cross off any Phillips from the past decade.
That leaves us with one.
"Connor Phillips"?
That's him.
That's Pat Phillips' dad.
He died here 13 years ago.
So, it does just record a memory?
[Will] It's pretty fucked up what happened today, huh? With Lacey?
She spoke out of turn.
And she knew the rules. She basically helped write them.
It's just you and me talking.
You don't believe that.
Stop telling me what I believe, Will.
Proving the existence of an afterlife destroyed Dad's own life.
That's what I believe.
Yeah... everybody else's, too.
Dad has no intention...
of showing anything the machine records with the outside world.
That's why he lost it when Lacey told people.
If he has no intention of showing what it does to anybody,
why is he doing it, huh? What's the point?
"Why is he doing it?"
"Why is he doing it?"
Let's see.
Well...
he'll tell you about the millions of people who died,
and he'll tell you about finishing his work to honor them.
I heard that yesterday.
I've been hearing that for the past two years now.
And I just... smile and nod and agree...
like the idiot son, but I do understand things.
I know Mom died...
Not died. She killed herself.
She killed herself.
And when you look...
at what Dad spent his life working on,
and when you look at the way Mom killed herself, how she did it...
how would Dad not feel a little anger on top of his guilt?
Dad does need... to know.
He needs to know that she made it somewhere.
He overreacted, that's all.
He'll come to his senses, and, uh, Lacey will be back by tomorrow.
Dad always comes to his senses.
It's not a memory, Will.
What?
[Isla] On his left arm in that exact spot, there was a different tattoo.
-[Will] How is that possible? -I don't know, but in the lab, I saw it.
It wasn't a lighthouse. It was waves on his arm.
-Are you sure? -Yes.
It's not a memory. This is something else.
If it's not a memory, then what is it?
Everything we've seen doesn't exist anymore.
I mean, the hospital room's gone, Pat Phillips, obviously gone.
We need to find something in this video that still exists.
The... The woman. There's a...
Her.
We have Connor Phillips' address on his death certificate.
So, I say that we go down there tomorrow...
and we see if somebody can help us track her down.
Will, why are we back here?
I don't know what's waiting for us at that house, and I...
Do you remember I told you about my accident when I was a kid?
Yeah, when you lied to your mom about what you saw.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
This is where I saw whatever...
Whatever it is that I saw. This is the beach.
I used to come here when I was a kid, like... I was drawn to it.
Or it made me feel better.
Anyway... Um...
when I saw you walking into the water the other day, that's...
That's why I was here.
What?
I had a son...
and he was five years old.
And I fell asleep...
just for a second.
And when I woke up, he was gone.
At first I thought I wasn't supposed to meet you... or feel anything.
But maybe I was wrong.
Um, hi. Is this the Phillips residence?
Connor... Did you know Connor Phillips?
Pat Phillips? Can you speak English?
Okay.
Okay, well, that's clearly not the woman from the video.
Maybe they moved or something.
Should we see if they have the new address?
I don't know. I don't know.
Can I help you?
I haven't seen my brother in years.
I'd call it more of a loss for her than for me.
Alzheimer's.
She deteriorated after Dad died.
-Connor? -You knew my father, too?
You know, actually, Pat mentioned him. That he went to see him before he died.
Well, anyway, Dad died and...
Mom, she started going downhill real fast after that.
My husband and I, we own the house now.
Is there gonna be a service or anything, um, for Pat?
I wouldn't know.
I'm sorry, if you don't mind me saying,
you don't seem that upset about your brother's death.
[sighing] Look...
it seems as though you liked him. You found something in him...
so, I'm sorry.
But to the rest of us... he was a piece of shit
who left his sister with a cancer-ridden father
and a mother who lost every marble she ever had.
I'm sorry. So... [clears throat] is the last time that you saw Pat
when he went to visit your Dad in the hospital?
I don't know what bullshit he hauled your way,
but he never visited my father in the hospital.
If he told you that, it's a lie.
He called and said he was gonna visit him, but he never showed up.
This is gonna sound really strange, but did Pat have a tattoo?
He told you about that?
Well...
When he turned 18, we got matching waves.
We were really close then.
So, the machine doesn't record a memory. It wasn't a bad theory.
People are just gonna keep killing themselves.
You know, sooner or later, you're gonna have to forgive your dad.
I've been thinking a lot about the difference between...
what something is and what something means.
And I don't know what any of this is...
but I do think if there's a meaning to any of it,
it has something to do with not pressing the reset button,
even if things get really rough.
We're a bunch of people running around, making the same mistakes over and over.
And I don't know why we think it'll be different somewhere else...
unless we learn what we're supposed to while we're here.
What was your son's name?
Oliver.
I was dreaming.
When he was in the water, I was dreaming.
What about?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
It was one of those times where you know for sure you're dreaming, but you don't...
don't know what about.
I wish I knew.
You don't have to do this alone anymore if you don't want to.
[Toby] Will!
Fuck! Fuck, Will!
Get up. It's Dad. What the fuck are you doing?
What about Dad?
-It's dad. Get the fuck up. -Okay. All right. I'm coming.
I didn't know, so, I couldn't stop it.
Slow down and tell me exactly what happened.
He hooked himself up to the device. He wanted to prove that it works.
-Dad's hooked up right now? -Yes.
[Isla] We need to tell him that it works.
What?
What works?
-What are you doing? -He demanded.
-Why aren't you bringing him back? -He's too far along.
We already know that it records something.
Cooper...
it works, okay?
Dad?
Dad?
[woman] Time to pull yourself away.
Come back to reality. Come home.
-Is that Mom? -It's Mom.
[Harber] What I'm doing is reality.
I need to finish. It's important. Do you understand?
-Their anniversary. -Yeah.
[woman] I'm going upstairs.
[Harber] Now, don't be dramatic. I'll be done soon. And we can have dinner.
[Harber] Honey, wait.
Maybe work can wait. So, what do you say we have some dinner?
She's not taking the bath.
-That's not what happened. -I know.
We can bring him back.
Cooper, just... wait. We have to see what happens.
[Cooper] We've got to do it now, or it'll be too late.
Will, come on.
Toby, I'm sorry. Cooper, now!
-Dad? Dad, listen to me. -[defibrillator shocks]
Dad, please. Listen to my voice.
-Is he gonna be brain...? -I don't know. I don't know.
Cooper, hit it again!
Dad?
What happened?
I knew I saw her.
Like a dream that you can't remember.
I can't figure out what this is, Dad.
I never left my study. Never stopped her on the stairs.
-And she drew a bath. -[Will] I know.
And in the Pat Phillips recording, he has a different tattoo on his arm.
[Harber] I always said the afterlife was a different plane of existence.
But...
what if it's a different plane... of this existence?
Alternate realities?
No, our reality... with differences and variations.
Stepping out of a truck... to visit a dying parent.
Random, like different tattoos.
Stopping someone from going upstairs to end their life.
When we die, what if we travel to an alternate version of our own life?
A second chance?
Then we wouldn't... just have to accept our biggest regret.
In the afterlife, we could change it.
At the risk of stating the super fucking obvious...
if you are right and word of this got out--
We have to destroy the machine.
[Cooper] Hey, Thomas.
Everyone wants to know what's going on.
Welcome, everybody. Nice to have you all here.
I asked you to gather here today because I thought that we should be honest.
-Hi. -Honest with ourselves,
honest with each other.
-You got to see your mom again. -[Harber] I see you as family...
and I think you see me in the same way.
And as family...
I think sometimes we get so absorbed with...
what we're doing individually, we go off on our own track and so forth,
we lose the fact that how important family is.
Lacey?
Lacey.
Lacey, it's okay. Put the... Put the gun down.
Lacey, I was wrong. You do not need to do this.
I didn't kill her.
I just relocated her.
[Will] Isla?
Isla?
Isla. Oh, it's okay.
Isla? Dad! Oh, God.
Dad, please! I need your help!
[woman] Somebody go get help.
[panting] I just wanted my spot back.
Okay. Okay.
[Will] Isla. Dad, please help her.
Don't talk. Just breathe.
I don't wanna die anymore.
[boy] Yeah. Ha!
Isla?
Isla?
[Toby] They were asking, the cops, who to contact for Isla.
-Next-of-kin deal. -[Harber] I'll have Cooper look into it.
-Next-of-kin deal. -[Harber] I'll have Cooper look into it. [Toby] Okay.
I don't wanna overwhelm him with questions right now, okay?
Okay. Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
Yeah.
-Maybe I should go in and check on him-- -No, no, no. Don't.
He needs rest.
He needs to process, okay?
-All right. -You can check on him after dinner.
And then we'll finish breaking down the machine tonight.
[Toby] Okay.
But...
we haven't come close...
to figuring this all out yet, or what it all means.
Like, if it really is another version of our own life,
then what happens when we die again?
[Harber] Toby.
-Toby. -What?
[Harber] We've got to let it go for a while.
We've just got to.
[Harber] Completely dismantled.
-All traces need to be gone. -Thomas, I hear you.
[Harber] William?
Let us in, don't do this.
William.
He's on the ferry headed here?
-Not the same here. -What?
I don't understand. How are we watching this right now if he's not dead?
[man on TV] ...since Thomas Harber's first and only post-Discovery interview ended
[man on TV] ...since Thomas Harber's first and only post-Discovery interview ended with an on-air suicide.
Since then, the worldwide suicide toll has sky--
[Isla] I was watching that.
Isla?
-Isla? -[Isla] It's off-season.
-Why are you going to this dreary island? -Isla?
-I have to stop your shooting, Isla. -Sit down.
I need you to come with me right now.
Sit down, Will. This is just your memory. I'm a part of you. Sit down.
What are we doing back on this ferry? What the fuck is going on?
You were never able to stop me from killing myself until this life.
"This life"? What do you...? What do you mean, "this life"?
You always start back on the ferry.
[Will] Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive.
They don't exist in the same space.
Well, it looks like we're here.
You know what? I changed my mind. I don't know what I was thinking.
[Isla] The first time, you never got off the ferry.
Then the next day you read that a woman named Isla had drowned herself.
You went on and lived your life,
but the thought that you could've done something never left. It was always there.
[Isla] And then one day, just like everybody else...
I died.
And then you came back here.
How long have I been stuck living in this loop?
How many times have we met on this ferry?
Your death brings you back here.
You keep coming back over and over again and again.
I don't remember any of it. I don't remember these other lives.
Nobody can remember them directly.
But sometimes certain memories do have a way of sticking out.
[Will] You look so familiar to me. You look so familiar to me.
It's your lucky day. I don't normally carry these around.
-This is where I saw whatever... -[Will] This is the beach.
[Toby] How'd you know this is where you were gonna be staying?
[Will] We're a bunch of people running around making the same mistakes over and over.
And I just don't know why we think it's gonna be different someplace else.
What am I supposed to change?
You already changed it. You kept coming back until you saved me.
I didn't save you, you died.
There's more than one way to save somebody, Will.
[Harber] Cooper, ready on our end. We need to bring him back.
How can I hear my dad? He's in a different place.
Two separate parts in the same place.
[Toby] Okay, Dad, defibrillator's charged.
No, no, no. I'm not ready to go back yet. I need more time with you.
Toby, please wait! Not yet!
[Cooper] His vitals are concerning me.
If we pull him now, we might lose him.
Isla. Isla, please. I'm not ready to leave you.
-What's happening to me? -You're about to die.
[Cooper] His heart's stopped, Thomas. Organs are shutting down.
They're trying to bring you back.
That's okay. If I die, I'll just come back here to you.
No, not this time.
You don't have to come back anymore.
You helped me get to where I needed to be and now you'll go someplace else.
When I get there, will I be able to remember you?
I hope so.
[Toby] Dad, everything is shutting down.
His brain's showing barely any activity.
You're leaving now. This is it.
[Harber] I'm not leaving this room until we revive my son.
When I get there... I'm going to remember you.
[Harber] We've gotta pull him out right now.
One... two... three.
Oh, hey. Look. You okay?
-Yeah. -Hey, come here.
Let me help you. Come here, come here. Oh!
I got you.
You okay?
-Holy cow. -Give me that pail.
-You went down pretty good, huh? -Yeah.
Yep. You okay? I got you.
Where's your mom and dad?
Oliver!
Oliver!
Hi.
It's okay. He's all right. He just...
-Okay. -I told you, you can't--
You can't just run off on me like that, okay? I've told you.
He was... He was just... He's all right.
He was struggling a little bit in the water.
I wanted to make sure he got back to you.
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
-Thank you. -Yeah.
He's a good kid.
-You're okay. -Thanks.
I mean, this is important.
[Patrick] Ground Leader checking in.
I was directly told that we cannot land on Mars before we do a med check.
Meteor shower incoming!
We have a meteor shower!
CAPCOM, come in.
Guys, just stay calm. We believe the orbiter can survive the meteor shower.
I believe we have a leak.
OK, pressure's going down. This is bad.
[camper] What do we do?
Get them out of here!
No! Oh my god! Throw them in the FEMA hallway!
Moderate cabin pressure onboard the Station.
[camper] Cabin leak check. Losing air pressure.
Are we dead?
Are we OK?
All in a day's work!
Space for me is one of the things that defines me most, I think.
It really is a central part of who I am.
I am a space nerd.
Yeah, I would say that I am a space nerd!
I am the biggest space nerd of all the space nerds ever.
It may not look like it, but I am.
Because space is space and it's awesome.
-[CAPCOM] Up here we may be slightly... -[mission control] OK, stand by.
We have you go for orbit. You're go for orbit.
[Dr. Michio Kaku] When we look at the night sky, we think
"Are there any planets out there that are possible homes for humanity?"
[newscaster] The spacecraft almost seemed to grow stronger as the days went by.
Going to Mars will foster an entire revolution
in how people think about how they will invest their brain energy
in their lives and in their careers.
By the way, this next generation wants to do it because they know it's cool.
[astronaut] Go for landing, 3,000 feet.
[mission control] You're looking great, so we know it will be a good flight.
[CAPCOM] Astronauts report it feels good.
[Raj] It's been over 50 years since we've done something significant like this.
Having a man, or woman, walk on Mars is just the most badass thought in my mind.
[mission control] Liftoff.
I think Mars is an interesting planet
and it would be fascinating to do science there.
[CAPCOM] We just had word from Houston we're ready to have you get out whenever you're ready.
[astronaut] OK, we've got our go now. Is that right?
[CAPCOM] Affirmative.
[Josh] This is where people are going to live, on another planet,
close enough to get there in under a year.
So yes, it's dangerous! Yes, it's never been attempted.
Yes, you're probably gonna die.
But you can do it still.
[astronaut] How you doing, Mission Control? -[mission control] Good. -[astronaut] Telcom? Guidance, happy?
-[mission control] Good. -[astronaut] Telcom? Guidance, happy?
-[CAPCOM] Go! -[astronaut] Final go!
[CAPCOM] 2,000 feet. 2,000 feet. Into the air, 47 degrees.
[astronaut] Roger.
[Tim Urban] Does anyone regret going to the Moon?
Does anyone who lived in the 60s say, "What a waste of time,
I wish we hadn't done that."? No. Going to the Moon was awesome.
Everyone's happy we went to the Moon! Mars is even cooler.
[newscaster] Mariner is the spacecraft. Mars is the destination.
[newscaster] Americans could once again  look up towards their future with faith
and with confidence.
We're focused on Mars. That's NASA's ultimate goal.
To lead other nations, and particularly ourselves,
with humans to Mars.
[newscaster] The retrograde rockets will be tested in space.
The antenna housing will transmit telemetry.
[Alyssa] Ever since I was little, I've always had a passion for space.
It would be so amazing just to see the Martian surface with my own eyes.
[mission control] T minus 25 seconds.
We will go to Mars. Let's go out there and explore.
Let's make discoveries. Let's change the world.
-[camper] Is this the PCS right here? -[camper] OK, the L Cone...
[instructor] A couple of things you need to know.
When the launch happens going to Mars, what are we going to say to the press?
[camper] I mean, I'm sure Neil Armstrong had a ton of time
to think what his first words would be.
I know what I would say. What do we want? [all] Oranges.
When do we want we want them? Oranges! [instructor] Fantastic. That's a great monologue.
However, we're going to transition to practicing your checklists now.
Everybody has a checklist that was either on their seat
or around their space.
It's under your suits.
It's what happens when you start before the mission starts.
Coming to Space Camp is the closest I can really get to space,
at least emotionally and psychologically.
7A on.
[instructor] Do you guys feel good?
[Josh] C auto.
Tank 9. Reset.
[instructor] This is the suiting up process. We'll transition over.
Grab the book. You got it?
[Josh] If people want to call me a space nerd, they can call me a space nerd.
And I'll say "Yeah, so what do you want to know about space?
You want to know about SRBs, egress, ECLSS?"
And they'll be like "What?"
And I'll be like "So, wait, which one did you want to know about?
Cause I can give you at least five,
maybe ten minutes of conversation for each one.
Come at me, bro!"
-Let me out of this. -Come on, Josh!
Today, we were the first group ever to test out this new Mars Mission.
[instructor] This mission is a futuristic mission,
obviously, because we haven't gone to Mars at this point.
This is MEB, the Mars Elysium Base.
And this base has been delivered to Mars already
with all the gear that you guys are gonna need to set it up, OK?
[Kyle] The Mars Mission is something that they've had in R&D for a while.
It's exhilarating, the fact that we are simulating a mission to Mars.
[instructor] You got your guy out there. Pull it up.
[Zoe] We are training to go to Mars.
We know that there will be problems because it is dangerous.
We need to have the simulator as close to a nominal mission as possible.
[Raj] This is gonna be intense!
Space Camp was designed to simulate the peak of NASA.
This is cool! Woah!
[Zoe] Here at Space Camp, we learn a lot about space history
and what it will be like to be an astronaut.
All of the simulators here, NASA has been recruited to help design.
So, they're as close as we can get to what the astronauts actually use.
Oh my God!
[Victoria] This is my third year at Space Camp.
I said, "I'm going to apply for a scholarship,"
because being an astronaut is something I don't want to give up on.
I'm going up whether I want to or not!
I had to get three letters of recommendation, I had to write two essays,
and I had to do a science experiment and break it down in the scientific method.
[instructor] Oh! Good job, Victoria!
[Jace] I believe that the people who come here are the future of the space program.
It's really giving us an education
on how to be a person who works with space on a daily basis.
When I grow up, I would like to be CAPCOM for NASA.
-I want to become a mission specialist. -Be a machine toolist.
I want to be an engineer.
Aerospace engineer.
It would be amazing to construct engines for a mission to Mars.
When you enter the base and turn on the emergency power,
it turns to red lighting.
[instructor] That's what we're wanting...
[Jace] The base that they've designed up there is fascinating.
The base is all powered down.
They have to turn on the communications array,
set up the solar panels, set up all of the ECLSS systems,
and also set up a greenhouse
because somebody might want to eat up there.
-[camper] Activate the power. -Hey, guys. The hydro popo is in here.
The fact that people are now even teaching children,
16 year-olds, 15 year-olds,
saying, "Hey, we're going to Mars" and simulating how it would work out,
means they'll grow up and we'll grow up to believe: hey, we're going to Mars.
So let's go to Mars.
[camper] I'll go there in a minute.
Well, good luck.
[male voiceover] Of all the planets in the solar system,
Earth and Mars, the third and fourth planets from the Sun,
are the most similar.
But despite the similarities, Mars is essentially like no other planet.
[Jeffrey Kluger] One of the greatest  allures of Mars is that Mars is nearby.
Mars is a planet, and it's a planet with potential.
It once had water. It once had oceans.
Surely, we tell ourselves, it once had life.
[male voiceover] Science fiction writers  populated the cities
with terrible creatures of heroic size, with skills beyond earthman's dreams.
[Kluger] This is a place that touches us in a very basic way.
Another thing is that it's always had the power
to scare the daylights out of us.
[Kluger] It was always the blood red world that was just nearby,
that, through telescopes, appeared to have canals,
which presumed people or some kind of organisms.
And since the only model we know for intelligent organisms
is organisms that eventually try to grab land and resources and go to war,
Mars used to frighten us.
[robot] Welcome to Mars.
[Bill Nye] There's a whole endless string of movies and television shows and stories
about aliens, alien life.
Now, this is the plan: get your ass to Mars.
[Urban] When people hear the word "Mars",
they think of science fiction, of geeks talking about Martians and Mars.
they think of science fiction, of geeks talking about Martians and Mars. And as soon as we go there and there's humans there, that changes.
This is not science fiction. This is now something we do. This is part of life. This is real.
This is part of life. This is real.
[Andy Weir] I had no idea that The Martian would have mainstream appeal.
It never even occurred to me.
I thought I was writing it for this tiny niche audience of hardcore space dorks.
[Kluger] We fell in love with Mars a long, long time ago
and our goal now is to be a part of Mars, is to live on Mars.
[Urban] Doing something as hard as going to Mars doesn't just happen.
You need like a perfect storm in many ways.
You need the right moment with the right funding,
with the right people or person.
[Nye] Wernher von Braun is a famous German scientist
and he took these ideas about how to operate liquid-fueled rockets
and he made these extraordinary spacecraft
that went on to put humans on the Moon.
[Charles Bolden] Wernher von Braun, when he designed and built the Apollo program,
in the back of his mind already, he was way past Apollo.
He and his team were talking about: how do we get to Mars?
We knew that the city of Huntsville was solidly behind us,
and with your continued support
I will see you back in orbit with that new space station,
to which we will all ride in the reusable launch vehicle,
and maybe one day we'll have a man on Mars.
Thank you.
[Annie Jacobsen] Von Braun was a Nazi.
Von Braun was in the SS,
which is the dreaded element of the Nazi party.
And von Braun was Hitler's top weapons maker.
[Kluger] From a man who held a dark and hateful cause,
came a missile that gave America
one of its greatest historical inspirations.
So Wernher von Braun is...a mixed bag.
-[camper] You tightened the valves? -[camper] It works.
[Raj] Dude, wherever I cut one I should cut the other, right?
[camper] Yeah.
[Raj] So what do you say? One, two, three, four, five, six.
How about six runs up and six runs up?
So it's one, two, three four. So it's the fourth one down.
If you could combine nerdy and cool, I hope you could get something like me.
How's it going?
It's a little rough. The X-Acto knife slipped twice, as you can see.
-Just got little duct tape bandages. -Here, use better duct tape.
Yeah, that's a good point.
Nerdiness has kind of taken a bad rap over the years.
And nerdy is the new cool.
But that doesn't mean you have to start wearing Jordans or anything.
But I feel like the egg should be standing up in the compartment, though.
-[camper] It will. -Like standing vertically.
-[camper] I know. -[Raj] All right, cool.
I'm hoping one day to run for office and work my way up in Washington,
and ultimately get NASA the funding it needs
to, you know, do these great things like go to Mars.
We usually just, I think we should fold it in a way that it will definitely deploy.
The model rockets is a good challenge for the group.
Of course, rocketry is directly connected with NASA.
[Josh] So the awesome thing about rockets, I'd say,
is that they're handing explosives
and a whole bunch of, like, firing power to teenagers.
And they're like, "Here, go make it, go up into the air
and if it explodes, have fun with it."
So it's, like, yeah, I'm definitely going to do this.
We're gonna have to find a way for it to disconnect
while keeping the shot cord inside of the body... -Oh yeah, definitely. -Somehow...
[Victoria] I enjoy building rockets.
Later today we are launching our rocket with our eggstronaut Egbert in it.
And it has been so much fun just building it and tossing around ideas.
Put the hot glue on the edges of these and stick it down.
[Jace] The two things you're learning from these model rockets
is crew survivability and aerodynamics.
Everything else is intact. We just can't get this stuff tangled up.
As soon as this gets tangled, we're kind of done.
-[Raj] Let's see how this drop goes. -[camper] High check, science geeks.
[instructor] Very nice.
[Jace] You have to keep your precious payload alive,
and you want it to pierce through the air in a beautiful parabolic trajectory.
That fits there really well.
It's really important that we see the big picture.
It's important that the whole system, including our eggstronaut,
are safe and reliable.
[Raj] No, no, no. That means we have 250 left.
-[Josh] And then we have 150-- -[Raj] 150 left.
[Josh] And then we just used 100 for the motor tube. So we would have 50.
[Raj] In our engineering challenges, we're assigned a budget for what we do
and you can't overspend it.
And sometimes you don't even have enough to begin with.
Dude, we made a mistake for the first item.
This 150 is actually 200.
So then now we're left with 100.
The money is a big constriction for humans in real life.
So, they decided to make it a constriction for us, too.
How much money have we spent?
Jace, I'm gonna go glue these together, OK?
They put a limit on it to say,
"Hey, we're not gonna give you all the materials,
because if we did you could do so much."
[Raj] So the way these rocket engines work is it propels downwards.
When we deploy it, the parachute's gonna unfurl
and it's gonna float down like this.
And our egg's gonna survive.
Good stuff, guys! This was a productive session.
[Josh] Ballin' till we drop!
[Kluger] The V2 rocket was built by Wernher von Braun
and his team of engineers.
It hits randomly.
You don't really know what you're hitting, what you're killing,
what you're destroying.
That was what the V2 did.
The "V", for goodness' sake, stood for "Vengeance".
It was the weapon that resulted from a tantrum,
in this case the tantrum of the führer.
He wanted to lash back, as all losing causes do.
They flail at the end.
[newscaster] The President of the United States.
General Eisenhower informs me
that the forces of Germany have surrendered to the United Nations.
The flags of freedom fly all over Europe.
[Jacobsen] At the end of World War II,
the Cold War had, in essence, already begun.
It was clear to the Allies that we could not coexist with the Soviets.
If we didn't get von Braun, then the Soviets would.
We had to have him.
[Neil deGrasse Tyson] Oh my gosh!
How soon we forget
how evil the communist empire was perceived to be
in that day and in that time.
And how much of a motivating factor that was to do anything we could
to not be bested by our arch enemy.
[Bolden] Not a lot of Americans know that we took a...a Nazi,
someone who helped designed rockets that were intended to kill us,
relocated him and his team eventually to Huntsville, Alabama,
where they became founding fathers of the spaceflight program.
[Jacobsen] He became such a vocal figurehead
for space, for exploration, for the red planet.
In the early to middle '50s, von Braun became famous.
He began writing long magazine articles about travel to the Moon and to Mars.
And he even signed a deal with Disney.
[von Braun with strong German accent] When the day arrives for construction to begin,
the thousands of parts for the space station
will be transported to the orbit by our multistage rockets.
It's a real moment in American history
when 42 million Americans tune in
to watch von Braun talk on a Disney television program
about space travel.
[von Braun] If we were to start today on an organized and well supported space program,
I believe a practical passenger rocket could be built and tested within 10 years.
[newscaster] Today, a new moon is in the sky,
a 23 inch metal sphere placed in orbit by a Russian rocket.
500 miles up, the artificial moon is boosted
to a speed counterbalancing the pull of gravity,
and released.
The whole applecart was overturned when the Russians put Sputnik into orbit,
causing a national nervous breakdown as a consequence.
The Soviets had Sputnik up in the sky and you could hear the beeping going by.
The entire country was in shock by Sputnik.
[Nye] Sputnik orbited the Earth on what you would say in military terms
was the ultimate high ground of space!
[newscaster] The reaction was one of astonishment and concern.
For it was now known that a potential enemy
was at least temporarily ahead in developing means for space travel.
We were scared to death when Sputnik went up.
And then we were scared to death
when the Russians beat us to orbit with a human.
[Nye] It seemed at once that this competitive style of government
was producing technology faster, outstripping the United States.
And so, a civilian space agency was formed,
and that's the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA.
Welcome to the Marshall Space Flight Center.
Our special task here in Huntsville
is to develop the rocket powered systems necessary to orbit man in an Earth satellite.
to orbit man in an Earth satellite.
You might say we are the long distance movers.
[Jacobsen] All effort was given toward making sure that America got into space pronto.
And that is where von Braun began his ascent
as kind of the American space savior.
And from there, he became the prophet of space exploration.
For we meet in an hour of change and challenge,
in a decade of hope and fear,
in an age of both knowledge and ignorance.
The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds.
[Jacobsen] When you think of the Apollo program,
when you think of man on the Moon,
no doubt von Braun is a huge piece of JFK's legacy.
[JFK] The vast stretches of the unknown,
and the unanswered,
and the unfinished,
still far outstrip our collective comprehension.
To be the first person on Mars, it would definitely put you up there
with those big names that most people know about space.
Alan Shepard, Yuri Gagarin, Neil Armstrong, and von Braun.
It would definitely come with a bit of infamy.
[JFK] Surely the opening vistas of space promise high costs and hardships,
as well as high reward.
So, it is not surprising
that some would have us stay where we are a little longer,
to rest, to wait.
To be sure, we are behind, and will be behind for some time,
in manned flight.
But we do not intend to stay behind,
and in this decade we shall make up and move ahead.
[Todd May] Building something from scratch is a double-edged sword.
You can't design a perfect launch vehicle from scratch
and put it up on the pad the very first time
and expect things are gonna go well.
This generation does not intend
to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space.
We mean to be a part of it. We mean to lead it.
Since NASA was formed in 1958,
we've had a pretty small number of different missions
that we've undertaken.
The first program was the Mercury program,
just to see if an astronaut could survive in zero gravity.
This is Flagship 7, radio loud and clear. Over.
[Dr. Don Thomas] We went on to the Gemini program, sending two astronauts up in a capsule.
We learned how to do rendezvous and docking.
And we learned how to walk in space, to float there.
[astronaut] OK, yeah?
OK.
[astronaut] You're right in front, Ed. You look beautiful!
[White] I feel like a million dollars! So I'm gonna kick off!
[Dr. Thomas] We put together everything we learned from Mercury and Gemini in the Apollo program.
[JFK] But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal?
And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain?
[mission control] Liftoff! We have a liftoff!
[JFK] Many years ago, the great British explorer George Mallory,
who was to die on Mount Everest, was asked why did he want to climb it.
He said "Because it is there."
Well, space is there, and we're going to climb it.
And the Moon and the planets are there.
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there!
Going to the Moon, many people just considered outright impossible.
[astronaut] Four forward, drifting to the right a little.
[deGrasse Tyson] Once the impossible becomes possible,
that opens the floodgates of human imagination.
That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.
[JFK] We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon!
We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things,
not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
[Raj] We should probably check it, cause last time we had a pretty bad angle.
Dude, come on, let's check it.
No, I just want to make sure ours is positioned so we won't die again.
As a kid, I would love to witness one of our presidents
challenge NASA to land on Mars in a deadline that may seem impossible.
Because I feel like few things motivate humans.
I mean the Soviets motivated us, but that was out of fear.
I swear, if ours doesn't work
-I'm crying! -Oh crap, dude!
Ours looks all bent up and everything. What is he doing?
Dude, now look at it! We're bent to the side now. Oh my god.
-[camper] It's going to go that way. -[camper]...two, one...
-Please, please deploy! -Do it, do it, do it!
[all] Yeah!
[all] Rub the orange! Rub the orange! Rub the orange!
[Raj] I think we should go to Mars because we would learn so much along the way.
Forget about actually stepping on Mars.
I think the journey there is far more important.
We're checking the payload to see if it's still intact.
See any juice?
This chute idea might have saved us.
It's cracked.
No! I think we made it! Oh my god, we made it!
Yes!
[Raj] Wow, that was so ratchet.
[Eugene Cernan] Bob, this is Gene and I'm on the surface.
I'd like to just say, what I believe history will record:
that America's challenge of today
has forged man's destiny of tomorrow.
As soon as the first landing on the Moon seemed inevitable,
and certainly after it happened,
every single story written about that success
included a secondary story that said "So, what's next?"
[Cernan] And as we leave the Moon at Taurus-Littrow,
we leave as we came
and, God willing, as we shall return:
with peace and hope for all mankind.
God speed the crew of Apollo 17.
[Jacobsen] In that moment, von Braun  reveals his true ambition as a scientist.
This is a great moment. We've gotten to the Moon.
But actually it's a stepping stone to the red planet, to Mars.
[Kluger] Wernher von Braun talked about a Mars mission
and he talked about a possible presence, permanent presence, on Mars by 1981.
That sounds insanely ambitious:
11 years to have a permanent presence on two planets.
But the fact is, it was equally hubristic to say
"And we're gonna put a man on the Moon by 1969."
Except we did it.
So everything we were talking about doing in extremely short order, by 1981,
getting people on Mars,
was actually perfectly consistent with the extremely short order work
we had done to get to the Moon.
[Jacobsen] The plan to go to Mars was complicated in the '60s
because the way von Braun saw it, this was gonna be a symbol of the future.
But the way the public interpreted it was entirely different.
Now, of course, there are many other  things competing for public interest.
There is an election coming up, and there is a war going on in Vietnam,
and there are problems in the cities.
And quite a few people seem to believe
that we are taking money away from the public purse.
We prefer to see our space program in a somewhat different light.
We believe that we are actually producing values,
and we are producing values
at a faster rate than we are taking money out of the treasury.
[Kluger] Nixon had a choice to continue the program to go on to Mars.
The infrastructure for planetary exploration was in place.
The NASA personnel infrastructure that had gotten us to the Moon
was prepared to get us to Mars.
Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States!
[Nye] I gotta tell you, everybody,
this longing for the Apollo era is not well advised.
It's not coming back.
We're operating now not under the Kennedy doctrine,
but under the Nixon doctrine.
In reaching the Moon, we demonstrated
what miracles American technology is capable of achieving.
And now the time has come to move more deliberately
toward making full use of that technology here on Earth.
[Nye] President Nixon and his advisors
felt that U.S. public interest in space exploration had waned.
It was a very expensive undertaking. Let's do something else.
[newscaster] Sunday, April 12, 1981. Kennedy Space Center, Florida.
The Space Shuttle.
Fourteen stories high, 2,000 tons, poised on the pad for its maiden flight.
[Kluger] Nixon's goal was to contract America's space footprint.
To make getting to and from orbit routine, affordable,
and ultimately profitable.
But the Nixon doctrine,
the idea of monetizing and simplifying access to orbit,
did not work.
[mission control] ...two, one, starting motor ignition and liftoff!
Liftoff of Columbia!
The shuttle has cleared the tower.
Columbia, you're negative seats.
And liftoff.
Liftoff of the orbiter Challenger and the sixth flight of the Space Shuttle.
[Kluger] What's been happening at NASA has been a very long term drift
in terms of the manned space program.
After we went to the Moon,
it was the carousel of shuttle flights around the Earth for 30-some years.
That was it.
[mission control] We have ignition and liftoff of Atlantis and the Galileo spacecraft bound for Jupiter.
of Atlantis and the Galileo spacecraft bound for Jupiter.
[CAPCOM] Roger roll, Atlantis.
[Dr. Kaku] The Space Shuttle can't reach deep space.
The Space Shuttle was only designed to go whizzing around the planet Earth.
And so we began to realize that NASA lost its way.
And liftoff of Space Shuttle Discovery
to complete NASA's constellation of tracking stations in the sky.
[Raj] I understand things are being done by NASA right now.
But I feel like after the '60s,
the acceleration of the program just declined to a sad point.
[mission control] And liftoff of the Space Shuttle Endeavour.
[CAPCOM] Roger roll, Endeavour.
[deGrasse Tyson] We are no longer advancing a space frontier.
A space frontier is: how far have you gone lately?
Where are our farthest astronauts?
They're 250 miles above our head, driving around the block,
boldly going where hundreds have gone before.
That is not advancing space frontiers.
[Urban] Low Earth orbit is about putting  stuff in space to look back down on Earth.
It's about support for Earth industries.
The Space Shuttle sounds like this big exciting thing.
The Space Shuttle! We're exploring!
But actually what the Space Shuttle was was kind of a cargo delivery vehicle.
It would bring astronauts and equipment, back and forth from low Earth orbit.
[Kluger] The Shuttle drained NASA's resources.
It was a financial sinkhole, essentially, from 1975 up through 2011.
Any dreams of going to Mars during the Shuttle era were impossible
because all of the money was going to the Shuttle.
[Josh] NASA is kind of at a holdup. We haven't gone places.
So don't go to space.
But what you can send to Mars are non-humans and non-living things,
like robots.
[instructor] Before you leave this table, I need you to figure out what your robot's primary task is going to be.
You can't just send all of them in there and have all four of them try and do the same task.
That's not going to be productive.
[Aurora] All right, guys, we got everything up here, so...
Is that everything?
-[Aurora] Yes, it is. -Can we get a picture?
[Jace] We do robotics at Space Camp
because robotics is a huge part of the space program.
Exploration done today isn't done by humans.
It's done by robots.
[Kluger] NASA's unmanned exploration of the solar system
is the great unappreciated crown jewel of the space agency.
[newscaster] It began here at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida.
Viking 1 and Viking 2 were readied for their separate journeys to Mars.
[Patrick] A robot is important for forerunner exploration,
where we send a robot first.
It lets us know it's OK for us to go there.
The planet Mars right now is entirely populated by robots,
which is an interesting thing to think about.
[Bobak Ferdowsi] Curiosity's designed specifically to look at
past habitability and present habitability of Mars.
That's really taking the step of where we understood there was once water on Mars
to whether that water could have supported life on Mars,
or maybe even still support life on Mars.
[mission control] And liftoff of the Atlas 5 with Curiosity,
seeking clues to the planetary puzzle about life on Mars.
[Ferdowsi] The thing that makes Mars so incredible is that it's this sister planet of ours,
and the possibility that life could have arisen there some time in the past,
that maybe life is more prevalent than we thought in the past.
[mission control] At 10.13 local time we'll initiate the descent stage thermal batteries,
and from that point on EDL ops will take over.
[Ferdowsi] I'm a little partial to the Curiosity rover.
[mission control] We're down to 90 meters per second
at an altitude of 6.5 kilometers and descending.
I worked on that mission for almost 10 years.
[mission control] UHF is good.
Touchdown confirmed. We're safe on Mars!
[Ferdowsi] I think the longer you spend working on them, the more attached you are to them.
They become kind of like kids.
We are going to need a button pusher.
-I can do that. -Jace!
Jace, just a heads up, that's priority numero uno!
Jace is a good programmer. We can't afford not to--
-Jace, are you programming right now? -Yes.
[Jace] With these robots, you have to learn
how to program them to work without a human being at the controls.
Can Bucky hold one side of the yellow doors?
Which side do you want? I can program for both.
Jace is so good at programming. He just went right to it!
He's got a ton of patience when it comes to testing that robot.
A lot of times in retrieval,
the things are in a very specific place every time.
So we can make a rough program, go out, figure out what happened wrong...
...then just make it more and more and more and more precise
so we can perfectly execute that when the mission comes.
Activate COMS.
Right now I'm learning how to code in Python.
I'm new to it. I'll admit, I can't make something really complicated.
I can make a game of Pong work! That's about it.
But I'm learning.
A little nervous. It should work. I programmed it for a long time.
[Ferdowsi] With Curiosity, what was amazing
was that the first drill hole we drilled we found evidence of past water on Mars
and that that water was kind of relatively fresh
and could have supported certain types of life as we know them on Earth.
The next questions are really of whether life could exist on Mars.
Future missions can go and actually look for evidence of life.
And maybe the best way to do that is with humans,
And maybe the best way to do that is with humans, where they can bring samples back, like the Apollo missions did.
[Kluger] When we put a robot on Mars and we give it a name called "Curiosity",
and we have it send down automatic Tweets,
and we love it and we call it names like "plucky" and "tough".
[Raj] We're on the ground.
Just don't move yet! We gotta wait for Jace.
[all] Five, four, three, two, one!
[instructor] Begin!
[Kluger] We humanize robots because it's the next best thing.
But in the case of explorers on other planets,
humanizing, anthropomorphizing our machines
are because we don't have real people to get there.
[Raj] All right, lost a wheel.
[Ferdowsi] Humans can do in a day
what it takes a robot months or sometimes years to accomplish.
Curiosity's been on the surface for a little more than three years now,
and we guess that a human could do that  within a week.
All the science that we've done so far in that three years,
a human could walk around, chisel rocks, look at them, investigate them.
Don't move that. Don't move that. Patrick, don't move it!
Patrick, don't move it!
I can get it.
Just kind of disappointed that our bot didn't function how we wanted it to.
It was only able to complete two or three tasks,
rather than the about six that we had planned for.
[deGrasse Tyson] I've yet to see a ticker tape parade for robots.
Or a high school named after a robot.
So, there's the vicarious value that one of us experiences that
and comes back to talk about it.
You can touch that person.
And that person carried out the dreams of a civilization.
-[camper] No! -[Raj] Yo, man. Just keep going!
-[camper] Ten seconds! -[instructor] Nine, eight, seven, six... [all] ...five, four, three, two, one...
[all] ...five, four, three, two, one...
-Zero! -[instructor] Stop all your robots!
[Jace] Programming error.
Bot didn't function properly as how it was intended to.
It didn't perform as it did during testing.
It was really kind of down to me, and I kind of failed at the last second.
[Josh] The best thing about Mars and why everybody wants to go to Mars
is because we have rovers there.
We have machines, examples,
everything from it that says, "Hey come, come to Mars, come to Mars."
[camper] Can this be one of our layers?
[instructor] Yeah! You can use that as one of your layers!
[Josh] OK, we're naming it Neil Applestrong.
Applenaut training, so that's where we have an astronaut that's a green apple
and we make a space suit for it.
[Jace] A really good way to look at a space suit
is it has to keep you alive with oxygen and pressure.
So a one-minute test.
When it comes out you're gonna blot it dry.
We'll walk over to the hot box.
Go. Down, down, down.
When it comes to space, I know a lot.
[instructor] Stop! Hold them up.
Oh, no!
This is unfortunate. -What? -[Jace] I think there's water inside.
-What? -[Jace] I think there's water inside.
[Josh] People living in space for a year  now, that's huge for me. I love it.
And it's like, whoa! I want to live in space for five years now!
[Abby] To apply to become an astronaut,
all you have to do is go to the NASA website
and you'll find a PDF that you can download, fill out, send back in.
The basic requirements to be an astronaut
are not actually that difficult to achieve.
You need to have a four-year degree in a related field of STEM:
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math.
You need to have things such as general good health,
reasonably good eyesight, hearing, those types of things.
But it's when you look at the requirements that aren't stated
that things become more difficult.
[Dr. Bob Behnken] The original group of seven folks,
[Dr. Bob Behnken] The original group of seven folks, they were all military background when they came into the office.
But of course the mission of actually going on to Mars
really requires a wide range of experiences,
and so that includes medical doctors, it includes scientists,
pretty much everything under the sun.
I think I get smarter as I get older!
My time here as an astronaut
and my ability to have gone to space two times
has helped taken some baby steps
to take that next generation of space explorers even further.
[Dr. Thomas] I'm way too old to go to Mars.
25, 30 years from now, I'm gonna be 85, 90 years-old.
No way is NASA sending me to Mars.
[Dr. Kaku] The Mars Generation, is the generation of today.
It's in their DNA to become the astronauts, to explore the red planet.
[Abby] Ever since I was a little kid, I've wanted to be an astronaut.
Going to Mars is definitely something that would help NASA to draw public interest
and to reignite that fire we have for space travel.
[Ian] We were born at exactly the right time.
We will be in our early 30s around the time we are predicted to set foot on Mars.
And Neil Armstrong was only 38 when he set foot on the Moon.
[Alyssa] The age you should really start focusing more
and becoming really serious about becoming an astronaut
is for me, would probably be now,
so around 14.
Mainly because I'm starting to get
those certifications that I'll need in the future,
such as SCUBA diving certification, pilot's license
and sky diving certification.
[Rachel] When I got into space heavily, I was probably about 13.
If I had the chance to go to Mars, I would absolutely take it.
Like, I wouldn't even think about it.
[Zoe] I love space. I want to be an astronaut one day.
If I died on Mars, it would be sad, obviously.
But at least I would have died achieving my lifelong dream!
[Kluger] It takes a certain kind of person. Most of us aren't those people.
We are fortunate, we've always been fortunate as a species,
that there are people like that.
[Dr. Kaku] We have to be honest with the young generation of astronauts.
And that is, yes, there are dangers,
dangers that can be quantified,
but nonetheless dangers that will involve perhaps injury, perhaps even death.
[instructor] All pilots learn how to  escape from a crashed helicopter.
Because if you crash, what's gonna come save you?
A helicopter.
What rescued the Apollo and, before, astronauts out of the ocean?
-[camper] A helicopter. -[instructor] A helicopter.
When you go in, you'll receive a number, like you were told before:
one, two, three, four, five, six.
You will exit in the reverse order: six, five, four, three, two, one.
There's only one place that you will exit.
[Jace] We do water survival so that we can learn what to do
if something goes horribly wrong.
[instructor] We're going down!
[Jace] If something happens and the hatch  blows off of our spacecraft, it starts flooding,
you have to learn how to get out and get out fast.
Thank you, Instructor!
[Josh] If you're in a dangerous situation
where you're inside of a metal cage and it starts filling up with water,
you better know how to swim and you better know how to get out.
Because you're gonna die. Metal doesn't float.
-[instructor] Everybody out! -[Josh] Six out! Five, go!
You have to rely on your team to swim out before it goes all the way under.
And it's all about getting people to work together.
Because nobody can go to space alone on their own.
Nobody has so far, and I don't believe anybody will.
-You all ready for this? -[Raj] Yeah, I'm pumped.
I would definitely be willing to die to go to Mars.
My life is worth all the things that the human race as a whole gain from that.
[Senator Bill Nelson] When we went to the Moon,
we lost three astronauts before we ever got off the ground
in the Apollo 1 fire on the pad.
[newscaster] It was all over in one stunned, horrifying second.
An electrical spark apparently shot out
and ignited the 100% oxygen in the cabin that they were breathing,
as in a real spaceflight.
The crewmen never had a chance.
[Senator Nelson] Now we come into the Space Shuttle, and it's supposed to be routine.
And it's supposed to be this low incident.
Well, it almost happened to us on the 24th flight.
Four scrubs, any one of which, had we launched,
it would have not been a good day.
But then it happened to the 25th flight.
[mission control] Three, two, one, and liftoff.
Liftoff of the 25th Space Shuttle mission and it has cleared the tower.
[newscaster] So the 25th Space Shuttle  mission is now on the way,
after more delays than NASA cares to count.
This morning it looked as though they were not going to be able to get off.
[mission control] 1 minute 15 seconds, velocity 2,900 feet per second.
Altitude 9 nautical miles, downrange just at 7 nautical miles.
[Ronald Reagan] I want to say something to the school children of America
who were watching the live coverage of the Shuttle's takeoff.
I know it's hard to understand,
but sometimes painful things like this happen.
It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery.
It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons.
The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted.
It belongs to the brave.
[newscaster] What we're seeing here is very ominous indeed.
These are pictures which tell the story that is clearly the Shuttle breaking up.
[Kluger] Somebody once asked me,
"Is it possible to write an article on three ways to make the Shuttle safer?"
And my answer is "Yes, I can write it right now.
Don't fly Discovery, don't fly Atlantis, don't fly Endeavour.
Problem solved."
But we flew.
We lost no more people
and the program ended in something close to triumph.
But 14 people died.
[mission control] All three engines up and working.
Two, one, zero. And liftoff!
The final liftoff of Atlantis. On the shoulders of the Space Shuttle. America will continue the dream.
On the shoulders of the Space Shuttle. America will continue the dream.
[Dr. Behnken] I really feel that it's a part of each of our legacies to carry on that piece that those  astronauts that we lost started.
to carry on that piece that those  astronauts that we lost started.
Their legacy is that we can continue the journey.
If we don't, we won't be able to continue to evolve our presence
in low Earth orbit and on to Mars.
[mission control] The Space Shuttle  spreads its wings one final time
for the start of a sentimental journey into history.
[Dr. Thomas] One of the big ideas
for why to retire the Shuttle became this idea of going to Mars.
Let's leave low Earth orbit
and let's start going out further to explore Mars.
[astronaut] Hello! This is the International Space Station!
Well this is President Obama. Who am I talking to?
Hello, Mr. President!
You're talking to the increment 28 crew
and the crew of the Space Shuttle Atlantis.
[Obama] Well, this mission marks the final flight of the Space Shuttle program.
It also ushers in an exciting new era to push the frontiers of space exploration
and human space flight beyond Earth, and ultimately sending humans to Mars.
and human space flight beyond Earth, and ultimately sending humans to Mars. One of the reasons that the Space Shuttle had to be retired
is that it was so expensive to operate
that we couldn't afford to invest in the development of its successor.
That's why we've actually had a gap.
[mission control] Having fired the imagination of a generation,
a ship like no other, its place in history secured,
the Space Shuttle pulls into port for the last time.
[deGrasse Tyson] When the Gemini program  ended, no one shed a tear
because the mighty Saturn 5 rocket was sitting in an adjacent launch pad
ready to continue that mission, and we knew that was going to the Moon.
When people shed a tear for the last Shuttle landing,
I accuse them of shedding a tear not because they'd miss the Shuttle,
but because there was not a next spaceship to continue this adventure
that we could all then turn to and say, "Mothball the Shuttle,
we're going to the next suite of launch vehicles."
There was nothing there, it was an empty launch pad.
[deGrasse Tyson] I'm a little embarrassed that to get into space
we gotta hitch a ride with the Russians.
We're not even hitching a ride, we're buying the seats on the Soyuz vessel
to get to and from the International Space Station that we built.
So it's a little embarrassing! I'll be honest with you.
[Dr. Kaku] Who'd have thought
that with all the intense rivalry with the Russians to go to the Moon
that we would be dependent upon hitching a ride on the Soyuz spacecraft?
Let's say there's a crisis that erupts some place on the planet Earth
and all of a sudden we're in this awkward situation of being beholden to them
for access to outer space.
Perhaps that's not such a good policy.
[Dr. John P. Holdren] It's been costly to  buy seats on the Soyuz from the Russians.
We don't like being absolutely dependent on one other country
for anything as important as being able to get our astronauts into space.
I think the idea that we have to pay Russia $70 million
to send astronauts, our astronauts, American astronauts, to the ISS
is absolutely ridiculous.
[Senator Nelson] If you talk to the average person on the street,
they think the space program is over.
They associate our space program
with Americans flying on American rockets.
Not flying on the Soyuz that we fly on right now.
[mission control] Liftoff.
Liftoff of the Soyuz TMA-05M
carrying Suni Williams, Yuri Malenchenko and Aki Hoshide
on a two-day journey to the International Space Station.
[Kyle] The reason why we put the International Space Station up there in the first place
is so that we could start doing long-term experiments
on how a human will be able to survive in space.
Because the journey to Mars is going to take a long time.
You ready?
-[camper] Yeah, go for it. -Set?
-Go. -Two, three, four...
All right, so when an astronaut goes into space,
their body has a hard time adjusting to the fact
that now everything in their stomach is floating around.
The fluid in their ears is floating around and that's how we sense motion.
...twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.
[Kyle] Your ears are telling you that you're moving, you know,
you're not standing still.
But your eyes are telling you different, and astronauts have gotten sick from this.
[all] ...41, 42, 43, 44, 45.
Take off the blindfold.
What?
Dude.
-[Kyle] You feel super disoriented, right? -I'm still spinning!
[Alyssa] Space, in general, is a very dangerous place to go.
Space wasn't really meant for humans to kind of be in.
Hello! I'm Suni Williams.
I'm up here on the International Space Station.
All right, come on back. There's more to show you.
One of the things we do is we exercise.
We have some exercise equipment onboard the Space Station.
[Dr. Thomas] A lot of our research up on  the International Space Station right now
is looking at ways to minimize muscle loss, to minimize bone loss,
to minimize the effects of radiation on the astronauts.
And why do we do this today?
It's all in regard to these future missions going to Mars.
[Suni Williams] You might have noticed a little moon on the outside.
This is our orbital outhouse right here. It serves for two functions.
And, of course, you do have your privacy. There's a little door.
One of the really important things about living and working in space long term
is to learn how to recycle all the things you need,
rather than bring them up from the Earth.
[Marisa] Some of the obstacles that we face heading to Mars is we need water.
Water is a major resource.
Right now, we're working with the ECLSS system
where we can turn our own urine into water.
-[camper] Oh, lost volume, OK I got you. -[camper] We lost like a few milligrams.
The thing is, if we were to use the cotton we would lose so much.
[Zoe] ECLSS is the Environmental Control and Life Support System.
It is the way that astronauts breathe
and it purifies the water on the ISS for them.
It's still at 100. Where's ammonia?
-Somewhere. -Yeah, ammo chips.
Mars is the next place that we should explore,
because we've already been to the Moon and Mars just seems like the next step.
I want to test the pasta cause it could absorb some of the color.
[camper] That's what I'm thinking.
[Zoe] Mars has so many cool things.
Like it has water and the possibility of old extraterrestrial life
that doesn't exist there anymore.
So it would be great to see if we could find some answers to all of that.
-I think maybe gravel and then charcoal. -And then ammonia and then sand.
Oh look at, look at the color in this itself.
It doesn't actually retain any of the water.
Right now we're filtering water. So we have this terrible mix of water.
It's got like a pH of three.
It's not even water. It's just like poison.
They hinted that we are going to take this water, make our own filters,
and then drink it,
and hopefully it's not terrible and kills us.
That'd be very much appreciated if we don't die from it.
Water used to be delivered in water-filled bags like this one.
But since 2010, we got a system onboard that can purify the water real time.
We have filters and a keg-size distiller
that, with it, we can recycle about 6,000 liters of extra water each year.
[Raj] Right now, we're holding acidic water.
And our hopes are that lima beans are basic
and will counteract the acidity in this disgusting mess.
We're running it through the lima beans three times,
and then we're gonna test the pH afterwards.
By some miracle, the water will be slightly more basic than we started out.
I actually care a lot about this.
I feel like clean water is probably the most important thing ever.
Just because, at least here on Earth,
we still have over a billion people who don't have access to clean water.
I want to say four. That's a solid acidic of four.
We can accomplish so much in such little time,
like landing on the Moon.
People need to understand going to Mars, it's gonna be an expensive mission.
But the technologies that we'll develop from that itself
will pay off all that cost
because it'll pump new technologies and more industries into our economy.
[Abby] Most people don't realize how much NASA has done for us and for our society.
When you look at the lives that we live right now,
they wouldn't be possible without NASA.
[Senator Nelson] CAT scans, MRIs, the small cameras in our iPhones.
All of this has originated in our U.S. space program.
[Patrick] The Apollo program alone
was the reason computers took the advances to where they are.
So if we go to Mars, I'm sure we're gonna get tech advances
in ways that we can't even fathom.
One of the things Mars can offer us is growth and stimulation of the economy.
[Rachel] People say "Oh, what is the space program really doing for us?
We spend all these tax dollars into NASA. What does it give us?"
Space travel has one of the highest rates of return on money
that we put into it.
[Dr. Kaku] The space program has more than paid for itself.
Telecommunications, the internet, weather satellites,
all of it done in outer space.
In fact, if you shut down the space program,
we would be hurled back almost a century into the past.
Everybody in space, please listen up.
Whenever we approach whatever that payload is,
we need to be wearing protective gear.
Make it very clear we will wear protective gear
in the search for the payload.
I think we should go to Mars because we can.
We can do all these things.
And it's just, I feel like it's kind of sad that we haven't already.
Because we have developed technologies to do things like this.
We definitely have the intelligence.
The biggest thing we're missing is public support.
I'm gonna write down some information for you.
If they have to do an ISS reboot... Get a piece of paper ready.
I know people who think that NASA was mothballed.
NASA doesn't exist anymore. NASA's out of business.
That, in and of itself, is sad.
I think right now we should be monitoring, cabin pressure, O2, that kind of stuff.
And I'm gonna be needing to do med checks soon, just to see.
All right. And use all the computers to monitor vital systems.
[Rachel] Space is always there. Space is a constant presence.
When people ask me, "Isn't that not really a thing anymore?
We don't go to space anymore." I'm always taken aback.
It makes me feel like people are losing touch with their human spirit.
Is there any information of what this confidential payload may look like?
The information we have is that it's experimental.
It can pretty much go anywhere, do anything.
It is not contained and it is dangerous.
You need to protect yourselves and be very careful.
We're on the look.
We don't have a shuttle.
We don't have any way to get to space ourselves right now.
But I do believe that the U.S. space system, it's still a force.
[Obama] I know there have been a number of questions raised
about my administration's plan for space exploration,
and these questions come at a time of transition.
And in order to reach the Space Station,
we will work with a growing array of private companies
competing to make getting to space easier and more affordable.
[Bolden] The next President of the U.S.,
they will have two American companies, Boeing and SpaceX,
that will launch from the space coast
carrying the first-ever commercial crew vehicles
that are gonna carry Americans to the International Space Station.
By buying the services of space transportation,
rather than the vehicles themselves,
we can accelerate the pace of innovations, as companies, from young startups to established leaders,
as companies, from young startups to established leaders,
compete to design and build and launch
new means of carrying people and materials out of our atmosphere.
[Bolden] We cannot do deep space exploration,
particularly with humans, without these partnerships.
They're carrying our astronauts to the International Space Station.
And all of this is in preparation for, or as a part, of the journey to Mars.
We expect new spacecraft designed for long journeys
to allow us to begin the first-ever crewed missions beyond the Moon into deep space.
Because exploration will once more inspire wonder in a new generation.
[Josh] The SLS Space Launch System is a new way for people to get to space.
[Obama] There's a lot more of space to explore, and a lot more to learn when we do.
The Space Launch System is the new rocket for the agency.
It can take us to Mars. It can take us to deep space.
[Bolden] We're gonna have the largest, most powerful rocket ever known to man.
I don't think there is another vehicle on the drawing board
that matches the capability that SLS has.
[Alyssa] The way NASA is planning on getting to Mars
is using the SLS Space Launch System rocket.
The SLS crew compartment will go to space.
And then the Orion capsule, which will be on top,
will separate and start heading towards the trajectory of Mars.
[Heather McKay] When you look at the Orion crew module,
you notice that it looks like the shape of the Apollo capsule.
But the reason that shape is used is because the physics haven't changed.
We're going to Mars. It'll be in the decade of the 2030s.
And we're building the systems, the hardware, that will get us there.
[Obama] By the mid 2030s,
I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth.
And a landing on Mars will follow. And I expect to be around to see it.
[instructor] Let's have one person from each engineering team come and get your tray.
Right now, NASA is working on the Orion capsule
which is going to take us to Mars.
Two things of aluminum foil, a cork, and some spackle.
OK, so this is how thick we have. Can I take this for a minute?
We'll come back to that when we spackle.
-Yeah. Do we just spackle it right here? -[camper] Is that everything we have?
[camper] That's everything.
[Victoria] People have been talking about going to Mars
pretty much since we landed on the Moon
and discovered that Mars is another solid surface.
-Thanks. OK. Great. -Build this thing, baby!
A little color. Liven it up!
Ablative shielding is a very basic demonstration of thermodynamics.
Do you want to go get it?
-I got it! -OK. Have fun.
The pasta actually works pretty well. And I'm not sure why.
[Jace] There are different materials
that work in different ways, things that you'd never even think of.
Who thinks of using a sponge
to stop a 3,500 degree Fahrenheit flame from burning through a spaceship?
Who thinks of that?
I feel like this is very sturdy.
[Victoria] On Orion you're going to Mars,
so not only are you entering and exiting the atmosphere in the Earth,
but you're also entering and exiting the atmosphere on Mars.
So it's twice as important that you have it
because you need to be safe!
I feel like NASA's gonna call us... -...after this. -[Victoria] Future rocket scientists.
-...after this. -[Victoria] Future rocket scientists.
[Mark Kirasich] The reason the heat shield is so important
is because when you go to Mars the heat generated is very intense.
So, a lot of care goes into the heat shield.
[McKay] The heat shield gets almost 4,000 degrees, as it ablates all of that energy.
Yet inside the crew module it's room temperature.
It's just like in here.
[camper] I think we're feeling pretty confident.
Ours is destined to survive.
Failure is not an option for us.
[camper] Hey, I believe in it.
-So far so good! -That's how good ours is!
-Propane's afraid to start. -Yeah, really!
[Victoria] My team this year is really amazing.
I could not have asked to be put with a better group of kids.
The vast commonology of space does bring us together.
OK...
Oh, man.
-Ooh, it's very concentrated! -[camper] It's cooking.
Look at that heat dispersion. See that?
I'm seeing some smoke!
At school I do sometimes feel like the odd man out,
because I'm very much into space.
Come on, come on...
-Yikes! -We're hitting steel.
I was bullied since third grade, and that has definitely taken a toll.
Don't jinx it!
[camper] The foil is starting to come out, like the heat.
One time, we were doing an experiment in science class
and my partner picked me because she said apparently I looked smart.
I wound up doing all the work.
-[camper] Oh, that's not good. -That's not good.
When I would ask her about something,
she would just be like, "Don't fail me and I'll be fine."
No. That's how much we've gone.
-I was like-- -It's only been 46?! Wow!
But then I come here and I just meet these people
and it's like you can just be yourself and be goofy and be funny,
while still learning about space.
[Ferdowsi] I am definitely a space nerd.
It's just this weird love and excitement
and, you know, geeking out about certain details of space exploration.
You know, being impressed and excited by it.
I think that's what being a space nerd means to me.
It's a real honor to be recognized by your peers.
And, honestly, to be recognized by this group of people
and the entire Space Camp community is... It's pretty awesome.
So I went to Space Camp in the summer of 1995
and it was, you know, definitely a life changing experience.
So I'll begin with a story. I had my first kiss at Space Camp.
One of the amazing things about Space Camp was finding all these other space nerds,
finding my, you know, my group, my people.
Honestly, you know, like so many things,
being here helped open the path for me to do things that I really wanted to do,
to be, you know, the engineer that I am today,
to work with the amazing team of people that I get to work with.
To have this community is great, and so thank you so much.
And to that girl that I kissed,
I'm a lot better kisser and engineer nowadays, so thank you.
[campers] Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
[camper] Parachutes deploy! Reentry!  Success!
-We didn't land in the swamp! -[camper] Wait
He's alive!
-Whoo! Way to go, Egbert! -Did it burn through the shield?
-Are they going to crack it to see? -It didn't even burn through the shield.
Pretty cool to the touch.
-[camper] The yolk even survived! -[instructor] Yes, you're good. Good job.
-All right! -What layer did it get through?
-High fives all around. -High fives all around!
-High fives all around. -High fives all around! [camper] Where was your... what was your second layer?
[Victoria] The coolest thing about space?
I don't exactly know.
It's really hard to say the coolest thing about space.
One of my favorite things to do is sometimes when I'm out late at night,
is to look up at the night sky
and try to find the little red planet in the sky if I can.
[Dr. Kaku] When I look at Mars, in some sense I see our future.
Because it's practically a law of physics
that one day the Earth will no longer be able to sustain life as we know it.
The Earth is not a safe place.
On a scale of millions of years, there could be a killer asteroid.
And just remember, the dinosaurs did not have a space program.
On a scale of thousands of years, there could be another ice age,
another ice age that will force humanity to live, perhaps, deep underground,
or even leave the Earth itself.
[Urban] Our entire species is contained to Earth.
If something happens to Earth... Poof, we're gone.
Think about what that means. That means all music is gone.
All laughter is forever gone.
Shakespeare's gone. Mozart's gone. Basketball's gone.
Everything that has to do with humanity is just gone forever. That's it.
[Weir] We as a species need to live on multiple planets.
As it sits, we're all on one planet.
There could be a war. There could be a plague.
It is possible for humanity to be wiped out.
[Dr. Kaku] On a scale of decades, we also have climate change.
If you take a look at all the signs,
all the signs point up, in terms of temperature.
[Nye] Our space assets monitor carbon dioxide, they monitor the thickness of glaciers.
And we can see that humankind is changing the climate.
[Kyle] We're not dumping a lot into alternative energy.
We're cutting down rainforests, we're using up a lot of natural habitats.
A lot of problems with climate change are alarming
because we're finding these things are not reversible.
So, by exploring space, we can either find somewhere to go,
or we can develop technologies that will help us repair
what damage we've done.
[mission control] T minus ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four,
three, two, one.
It's not clear that the Space Launch System
is still on schedule and still on budget,
and this is a concern for everybody.
The SLS, it's an interesting machine, to say the least.
Almost all of its technologies are derived from the Space Shuttle.
Its engine's the RS25,
the same engine that we were running for 30 years on the Space Shuttle.
I'm a little bit disappointed that no new technology really went into making it.
[Kluger] The SLS can get us to Mars.
The SLS most assuredly can get us to Mars.
But the problem with the SLS, the Space Launch System,
the 21st century Saturn 5
and Orion, which is the 21st century Apollo program,
is that there simply isn't the money to get them built and tested and flying
in any kind of near term timeframe.
[deGrasse Tyson] NASA can say that Mars is in our portfolio.
We're gonna send astronauts there in the 2030s.
OK, show me the money. Talk is cheap.
So we can talk about going to Mars,
but until I see the launch pad with the spaceship equipped to accomplish that,
I'm not gonna run around saying "Yeah, we are the Mars people."
No we're not. Not until that happens.
[Donald Trump] Go ahead.
In my industry one of our biggest victories was putting a man on the Moon.
-Yeah. -What do you think about humans on Mars?
Honestly, I think it's wonderful.
I want to rebuild our infrastructure first, OK?
I think it's wonderful.
Go ahead.
NASA's not in charge, it's at the whim of government.
So every time there's a change in presidents, there's a lot of changes at NASA,  automatically.
Thank you, everybody!
We're not, we are not going to be taking any questions.
Thank you, guys!
[Patrick] We are building the SLS,
but at the rate we're going right now, it won't be done until I'm like 40 or 50.
They keep saying my generation is the Mars Generation,
but we're not at this rate.
We could be if we gave them the same support we showed the Apollo program.
[Nye] During the Apollo era, everybody,
NASA was funded at 4% of the federal budget.
Today, it's 0.4%,
almost exactly a tenth of what it was during the Apollo era.
And that's not gonna change. That's the way it is right now.
[Urban] NASA is handcuffed to the U.S. budget.
The U.S. budget has a thousand claws on it trying to get the money.
For NASA to innovate, for NASA to do amazing things that it would like to do,
it needs an insane budget.
It needs a far different budget than the other kind of agencies.
[Jace] NASA, all of the money they have ever received from the government combined,
is still less than the yearly budget of the D.O.D.
Which is kind of appalling to me.
[Urban] SLS and Orion are cool. I mean, if you like rockets, they're gonna be awesome.
They're gonna have immense amount of thrust.
But they haven't done the important innovation,
which is that they're still super crazy expensive.
If every time you flew in an airplane, you landed, the passengers got out,
and the plane was thrown away cause planes flew once,
well, it would cost a million and a half dollars for a coach seat.
No one would fly. It would be a zero industry.
It would be for crazy billionaires only.
That's the current state of our aerospace industry.
[Dr. Kaku] There is a nasty four-letter  word that has haunted the space program.
It's the "C" word. "Cost".
Imagine your body made out of solid gold.
That's what it costs to put you up in outer space.
That's why we have to drive down the cost.
[Urban] You can improve incrementally when it comes to getting off of Earth
with cheaper rockets and maybe better fuel.
But what was needed was like a giant leap forward
in the cost of space travel.
And there really was one way to do that.
And it was the fact that every rocket was used once.
There's a debate as to whether private enterprise or the federal government
can create innovation.
[Jace] Privatization of space.
This is a very interesting subject, to say the least.
[Raj] The private space industry is a direct result
of NASA not being able to fund everything it wants to do.
I don't think it's a bad thing, it's a good thing.
[Urban] NASA has a lot of leadership  potential and a lot of budget potential.
And it can use it to partner with these companies.
Rather than fight against these companies and make its own rocket,
let the private companies fight for who has the best rocket,
and then NASA will use that best rocket to do its business in space and in Mars.
[newscaster] Welcome to the live webcast of the SpaceX launch of the ORBCOM mission
from Launch Complex 40 out of Cape Canaveral, Florida.
[Nye] Elon Musk of SpaceX,
he asked, "What is it we need to do to go to Mars?"
And people told him, these are experts told him,
"We need to lower the cost of getting into low Earth orbit."
[Urban] Elon thinks of Earth as a hard drive,
and he thinks of humanity as a very important file on that hard drive,
and Elon looks at the history of mass extinction events
and sees the hard drive has a tendency to crash.
Some people think it's fine, just stay on Earth forever.
And some people don't.
Creating a self-sustained civilization on Mars
to provide insurance for life as a whole,
a future where we are a space-faring civilization
and out there among the stars
is infinitely more exciting and inspiring than one where we are not.
The goal of SpaceX is really to build the transport system.
It's like building the Union Pacific Railroad.
[Urban] What SpaceX is trying to do
is to build the first reliable interplanetary railroad.
[Lauren Lyons] Using today's standard technologies,
it would cost about $10 billion per person to get to Mars and to live there.
That's pretty absurd. Not many people on this planet that can afford that.
And if we're going to build a real civilization there
where we have thousands, if not millions, of people
living, working and thriving on Mars,
we're gonna have to get that cost down significantly.
[mission control] T minus one minute.
[Urban] The idea is the rocket takes off, pings a spacecraft into space,
either into low Earth orbit or towards Mars.
The rocket comes back and lands vertically,
gets some maintenance, gets refueled.
Boom! Pings another thing out into space.
It can do this all day.
It can send 15 things out in a day, one rocket.
[mission control] Liftoff!
[Kluger] While the U.S. plans to get human beings to Mars sometime vaguely in the 2030s,
he believes he can cut that time by 10 years
and get them there in the mid 2020s.
It never pays to rule out Elon Musk.
But, also, it never pays to get so seduced by the Tony Stark side of Elon Musk
that we think he can do anything.
He's gonna come up against
the same obstacles every other rocketeer in history has.
[Jace] Private industry is willing to take risks that NASA isn't.
This could be economically.
They could try to throw a lot of money at something that might not work.
But if it does work, boom. You have something amazing.
[mission control] The first stage is returning to land.
The second stage powers the Earth satellites into low Earth orbit.
[Urban] If rockets aren't reusable,
then humans don't go to Mars this century or next century,
or maybe ever.
[mission control] That is the first stage. Coming back down and landing!
I was just...not shocked, because I knew we had what it would take to do this,
we had come so close in the past.
But feeling all of these things that we've been talking about,
all this effort, blood, sweat, and tears that went into this to succeed,
it was now real.
It was there in front of us.
Being a part of that unique moment in history was just mind-blowing for me.
[Urban] Elon's idea is not to make the Mars thing happen by himself.
Elon is trying to start this chain reaction, he's trying to start a forest fire with a match.
By solving this one giant problem,
the fact that you had to build a new rocket for every launch in the past.
By doing that, he thinks he can ignite an entire new era of space travel
where we become a genuinely space-faring civilization.
[Lyons] The vision of building a civilization on Mars,
it's such a big, huge endeavor.
It's not something one single company can do alone.
You need another perfect storm,
you need some perfect storm of resources and technology and the right people.
And it's exciting that I think maybe we have that.
What SpaceX is trying to do is create a situation
where all these industries and governments suddenly start saying,
"Well, now this is an option we want to get in the game."
And suddenly, all this money pours into rocket innovation,
into Earth/Mars industries.
Then that's what empowers the big push to get a million people there eventually.
[Nye] Now, you can only go to Mars every 26 months.
The orbits have to be oriented.
You can't just fly over the Sun. We don't have enough rocket fuel for that.
[Alyssa] Sometimes Mars is really close to the Earth,
sometimes it's really far,
because planets orbit in an elliptical path.
And we'll stay on Mars for about a year or two, depending on its orbit.
We have to wait for Mars to come all the way back around
to its closest point for us to come back.
[Kluger] Once you're there, you have to be prepared to stay for an extended period of time.
And once you're prepared to stay for an extended period of time,
and the first handful of people, four people, six people, eight people,
learn to live off the land to the extent that that can be done,
learn to make Mars their home for more than a few days,
once you do that, you've hammered your first piton
in the great mountain of colonizing another planet.
If you establish first a cargo route and then a human transportation route,
you have to imagine that by a year like 2060,
you have a thriving civilization on Mars.
It's gonna be this normal part of life.
There'll be people going there for college,
people are going to be in long distance relationships.
There will be people born on Mars who want to go to Earth for a stint
to see the Eiffel Tower in the flesh, to see the Sphinx in the flesh.
[Victoria] If we could have a Mars colony, that would just be so cool,
to put footprints on Mars and now we are having life living there.
We can put people there. We can have people live there.
We could even terraform it if we really tried.
[Urban] What we're talking about eventually
is a blue-green planet with maybe 7 billion of its own people on it.
And you could look at a picture of a gorgeous green mountain
and a lake and not know what planet you're looking at.
[deGrasse Tyson] It's a brand new planet, who knows what future economies await us
on that planetary surface?
Even if you can't think of one now, it doesn't mean there isn't one.
And especially given the history of exploration and discovery,
there probably will be.
[Kluger] When you go somewhere else and live in a wild, rustic life,
you've made the decision that that kind of life,
the world you're building,
is more valuable to you than the world that's already built.
Your motivation is to live here, to settle here, to die here.
Because what you have in mind
is three, five, a hundred generations beyond you,
and you've made the decision that you're going to be
the first stake in the ground of that new world.
[Jace] Tell Orion that you're gonna start  their primary ingress checklist
for Commander and Pilot and DDP 1 and 2 and B 1 and 2.
[Colin] All right, so...you first, Orion, on F1.
Primary ingress checklist for Pilot and Commander...
All right, IDP CR22 power is on.
Major functions set to DNC.
We ordered that pizza 45 minutes ago. It's been over 30 minutes. It's free now.
No it's not. They stopped doing that anyway.
[Patrick] I want my free pizza!
-[Raj] All checklists are done. -Yay! Ascent procedures.
[Raj] Everyone switch to ascent procedures.
[all] Five, four, three, two, one...
[camper] Oh my goodness! That is amazing.
[Dr. Thomas] One thing that's impressed me the most, of anything else,
is that kids today have that same drive,
that same interest, that same passion for space exploration
that I had as a young boy watching the first American launch into space.
-[camper] That's a lot of retro. -[Raj] All right, listen up Orion.
Now we're done with launch so start focusing on our checklist again.
Our engines are turned off. We are good to unbuckle.
I'm floating around in the most peculiar way.
Early this morning, the Space Launch  System launched from Cape Canaveral,
carrying along with it the Orion capsule and six brave Americans
on their way to go boldly where no man has ever gone before.
Let's do this!
[Kluger] Exploration is absolutely embedded in our DNA.
If we are on this hill, we want to know what's on the next hill.
We cannot help ourselves.
There's no reason for us not to surrender to that impulse.
[Ferdowsi] The first steps on Mars won't just be a national moment of pride,
but really a worldwide moment of pride,
and ultimately, I think, kicks off this sense of exploration on the right foot,
of one that is as an entirely global experience.
[deGrasse Tyson] I have good evidence that space matters to the hearts and minds of people.
There's something special, I think, about the night sky
and about the universe
that lives within us.
[Nye] There are two questions that get everybody.
The first one is: where did we come from?
Where did we all come from? How did we get here?
And the other question is: are we alone in the universe?
If we were to discover evidence of life,
or stranger still, something alive on Mars today,
it would change the course of human history
in the same way astronomy has humbled us in the past.
The Earth is not flat.
We are not the center of it. The Sun's the center of it.
Wait! The Sun's not the center of it.
We're just one more sun in this galactic disc.
And we're not the only galaxy! We're not by any means!
We're just these specks on a speck orbiting specks in specklessness.
We're nothing.
Yet, we can understand that.
[Urban] Humans have lived a thousand centuries so far.
This century is the first time where suddenly going to Mars is an option.
[deGrasse Tyson] I think it's awesome that we have an entire generation of people
who want to go to into space, who want to go Mars,
who want to be STEM fluent.
But I can tell you that all of that will fall on fallow soil,
if there isn't some big mission
on the other side of that educational pipeline
where they can apply this energy and this enthusiasm.
[Dr. Kaku] It's our duty to breathe life and fire into the imagination of these young people
so they will say, "Yes! I want to become an astronaut!
I want to explore outer space!"
Because our true place is among the stars.
[Colin] Oh wow, we're landing.
We're landing. Guys, we're landing.
We are frickin' landing on Mars right now.
Dude, dude, dude. We just landed.
We're on Mars.
[Abby] I hope that my generation will be defined by Mars.
I can't think of a better thing to be defined by!
[Jace] Somebody from my generation will step out of the lander
and put their footprint down in the Martian soil.
If I could contribute to that in any way, it would be an amazing experience.
[Rachel] This date will go down in history.
After a long 183-day journey,
six Americans have finally exited the all-terra lander
and put their boots in the red Martian soil.
The Mars Generation is...us.
[Jace] Exploration is ingrained within our DNA.
Human beings, they want to learn about the cosmos.
[Josh] We know so little about space.
There's so much to do and so much to learn.
And I want to do it all.
[Aurora] Like, can you imagine if there was just nothing else?
That we had found everything there is to find?
Life would be so boring!
Let's go. Let's go to Mars.
[Raj] It's been long enough.
We need to go for it, full speed.
Because humans need to do significant things,
Sultan Muhammad and his people still hold out in Granada.
But if his son, the Prince is captured...
he will surrender the city and the Apple of Eden.
Do you Aguilar De Nerha
swear to honor our Order in the fight for freedom?
To defend mankind against the Templars' tyranny
and preserve free will?
[In Spanish] I swear.
[in Spanish] If the Apple falls into their hands
the Templars will destroy everything that stands in their way.
Protest, dissent, our right to think for ourselves...
Swear to me that you will sacrifice your life
and the lives of everyone here to keep it from them.
[in Spanish] Yes, mentor.
[in Spanish] Our own lives are nothing.
The Apple is everything.
The spirit of the eagle, will watch over the future.
[in Spanish] Where other men blindly follow the truth
remember...
Nothing is true.
Where other men are limited by morality or law
remember...
Everything is permitted.
[in Spanish] We work in the dark to serve the light.
We are Assassins.
Shit.
Mom?
Dad?
Your blood is not your own, Cal.
They found us.
Live in the shadows.
Go! Go, now!
You here to save my soul?
Something like that.
I understand it's your birthday.
Yeah.
The party's just getting started.
Sit down. You're making me nervous.
Oh, Lord, wash away my sin...
and I'll be clean...
once again.
You're not much for the Bible, are you?
Be it known that Callum Lynch...
has been found guilty of capital murder...
and is sentenced to die on this day...
October 21st, 2016.
Does the prisoner wish to make a final statement?
Tell my father I'll see him in hell.
My name is Dr. Sofia Rikkin.
At 6 p.m. yesterday evening...
you were executed and pronounced dead.
Insofar as anyone in the world knows or cares...
you no longer exist.
It's better that you sit.
My eyes.
What you're feeling right now is normal, if uncomfortable.
Cal...
I'm here to help you.
And you're here to help me.
Let him go.
Don't touch him.
Go ahead, do it.
Jump.
You're not a prisoner here, Cal.
I'm here to protect you.
If you listen to me, everything is going to make sense.
But you need to trust me.
Where am I?
You're in a rehabilitation wing of the Abstergo Foundation in Madrid.
A private organization dedicated to the perfection of humankind.
With your help...
we can pioneer new ways to eradicate violence.
I had this.
Your father wants him in.
He's my patient. This is my program.
Prepare the Animus.
-Are the blades prepared? -[man] Right here.
[Sofia] We've confirmed their provenance?
[man] They were recovered at Aguilar's burial site.
What are these?
[Sofia] Assume final preparations.
Our regression...
Andalucía, 1492. Record everything.
[man] Arm's ready.
What is this?
I'm sorry, Cal. This is not the way I like to do things.
Then don't do it.
Insert epidural.
What do you want from me?
Your past.
Listen to me carefully, Cal.
You're about to enter the Animus.
What you're about to see, hear and feel...
are the memories of someone who's been dead for 500 years.
Wait a minute!
You can't change what happens, Cal.
Engage scanner.
Status?
[man 2] Scanning DNA chains.
Searching for time frame.
First memory match locked.
DNA match identified.
Stay with it, Cal.
Attempt synchronization.
[man 2] We found him.
We found Aguilar.
[man 1] Synchronization achieved.
There.
Commence regression.
[in Spanish] Our mission is the boy.
[in Spanish] It's the Prince.
-[woman grunts] -[in Spanish] Who harbored the boy?
[in Spanish] I alone.
Nobody else knew he was there.
Hang his family and make him watch.
Burn the whole village.
[in Spanish] With the Prince of Granada as captive
his father the Sultan will surrender his rebellious city
the last safe haven for the infidels.
God will punish his people's heresy.
Finally Spain will be under one Templar rule.
Stay with the memory.
[in Spanish] Aguilar!... The boy, Aguilar....The boy
[in Spanish] Aguilar! The child!
Pull him!
Commence rehabilitation.
Run a systems check and log his condition.
You did well, Cal.
[Rikkin over speakers] Looking back, the history of the world...
is a history of violence.
Last year, the economic impact of antisocial behavior...
was $9 trillion.
We believe that man today experiences...
a measure of aggression... for which he finds no acceptable outlets.
for which he finds no acceptable outlets.
Now imagine...
if all these costs could be channeled elsewhere...
So, the regression went well?
[Sofia] Lynch is the one.
A direct descendant of Aguilar.
Everything was clear in there for the first time.
...what we all dream of...
a more peaceful world.
I see you stole my lines again.
I only steal from the best.
And the Artifact?
The Apple.
It's within our grasp.
What happened in there? Why did you pull him?
I had to.
We have to keep him healthy.
Earn his confidence.
And I know he'll lead us to it.
Push him.
That's not how the Animus works.
Here you go.
Thank you.
1917, Rutherford splits the atom.
1953, Watson and Crick find the double helix.
2016...
my daughter finds the cure for violence.
You've always been brighter than me.
Now I'm late.
I have to report to the Elders.
Francisco Rizi's Grand Inquisition...
1492.
War, religious persecution...
and the closest Father Torquemada, or any of our Order...
came to finding the Apple of Eden.
How are you, my friend?
Well...
Your Excellency.
Next week when the Elders meet...
we shall vote to discontinue your Abstergo project.
We feel that giving you three billion annually would be better spent elsewhere.
-Three billion is nothing compared to... -We've won.
People no longer care about their civil liberties.
They care about their standard of life.
The modern world has outgrown notions like freedom.
They're content to follow.
The threat remains...
while free will exists.
For centuries, we've tried, with religion, with politics...
and now consumerism...
to eliminate dissent.
Isn't it time we gave science a try?
My daughter is closer than we've ever been.
How is your beautiful daughter?
She has traced the protectors of the Apple.
Where?
Andalucía, 1492.
The descendants?
All the bloodlines have died out.
Bar one.
We've traced his back 500 years...
to the Assassin's Brotherhood.
The hallucinations are what we call the Bleeding Effect.
Images of your regression...
layer themselves over your present-day field of vision.
If you allow me...
I can teach you how to control them.
Stand down. I have this.
[man] Let her be.
What is it? The machine?
It's genetic memory.
By using the Animus...
we can relive lives of those who made us who we are.
What I saw in there...
it felt real.
It was.
In a way.
Don't mess with me.
I feel different now.
Why the aggression?
I'm an aggressive person.
What kind of prison is this?
It's not a prison, Cal.
You'll learn more if you cooperate.
Let me go.
I'm hungry.
Come with me.
What is this?
[Sofia] I know everything about you, Cal.
Your medical data, your psychological profile...
the mutations in your MAOA gene.
I know about the foster homes, the juvenile halls.
You're living proof of the link between heredity and crime.
How did you find me?
We found Aguilar.
And when you were arrested, your DNA matched his.
Who's Aguilar?
Your ancestor.
His family were Assassins.
They were burned at the stake by the Templars, Torquemada...
and the black knight you saw, Ojeda.
Aguilar took up the Assassins' cause.
Do you get out much?
More than you.
[Cal] And the others in here...
are they lab rats too?
[Sofia] They're Assassins.
Murderers, like their ancestors.
Like you, Cal.
All born with a predisposition to violence.
Murderer?
You killed a man.
A pimp.
Would you kill again?
[Cal] Happy families.
She must be very proud.
I wouldn't know.
She was killed by an Assassin.
Like your mother.
Sorry.
My old man killed my mother.
And how does that make you feel?
Like killing him.
Either we let it affect us for the rest of our lives...
or we do something about it.
You turned to violence...
I turned to science.
It's the Apple of Eden, Cal.
I believe it exists.
The Bible tells us it contained the seed of man's first disobedience.
But there are those of us who believe...
that God, or some ancient civilization...
has left us a road map to understand why people are violent.
Aguilar was the last person known to have had it in his possession.
We need you to find out where he hid it.
I thought I was here to be cured.
Violence is a disease, like cancer.
And, like cancer...
we hope to control it one day.
Violence is what kept me alive.
Well, technically, you're dead.
I'm hungry.
[Cal] What's in it for me?
[Sofia] Once my research is complete there is no reason to keep you here.
I get my life back?
Better.
A new one.
You're hungry.
You don't know who he is, what he is.
That's a dangerous man.
Give him a little more time, Emir.
The man might prove to have some noble blood in him yet.
How about here, sir?
It's an open menu, but we do recommend the chicken.
What can I get you, Mr. Lynch?
It's an open menu, but we do recommend the chicken.
I'll have steak.
Steak for the pioneer.
Who are you?
They call me Moussa.
But my name is Baptiste.
I'm dead 200 years now.
Voodoo poisoner.
I'm harmless. [chuckles]
Ah. They're watching you.
Waiting to see who you are, pioneer.
Have you met him yet?
Have you met him yet?
We are the last to protect the Apple, my friend.
Make the wrong choice...
you gonna send us all to infinity.
This...
belongs to you.
[woman on PA] Progress requires sacrifice.
You're gonna lead them right to it.
No. I'm going to eat it.
[woman on PA] In quality, find peace.
What the fuck is going on?
He has to go back in the Animus.
Now.
He needs time before he goes again.
We don't have time.
Why?
I won't risk his life.
Then I'll have to find someone else to do it.
You're up, slugger.
I'm crazy.
♪ I'm crazy ♪
♪ Crazy for feeling so lonely ♪
They're getting him back in again.
Then we should stop him before he betrays us.
-Set the date for the 6th. -[Cal] ♪ Why do I let myself worry? ♪
If his condition deteriorates, pull him out.
-Your father... -I don't care what my father said.
♪ What in the world did I do? ♪
[Sofia] Cal, listen to me.
-Listen to me! -♪ Crazy for crying ♪
-You have to stay with Aguilar. -♪ Crazy for crying ♪
Stay in sync with him or it could be dangerous.
♪ And I'm crazy for loving you ♪
[in Spanish] Soon they will march on Granada.
[in Spanish] Sultan Muhammad is weak.
He'll surrender the Apple and betray the Creed for the Prince's life.
Love makes us weak.
I would gladly sacrifice my flesh and my blood so that the Creed lives on.
When I die today don't waste your tears.
[in Spanish] The Lord spake
and he said
if a man abide not in me
he is cast into the fire
and he is burned.
For decades
you have lived in a land torn apart
by religious discord.
But soon
thanks to God and the Inquisition
we will purge this disease!
The sinners before you
sought to defend the heretic Prince of Granada
the last heathen stronghold in our holy war.
And so today before our King and Queen
I swear that we shall wash ourselves clean
in the holy fire of God!
Behold God's will!
[Ojeda in Spanish] You will watch your mentor burn
and then you will die the slowest.
Not to ourselves but to the future
give glory.
He's synchronizing.
[in Spanish] Damned heretics
don't let them escape!
[in English] Go!
Jump!
Complete desynch.
Get him down!
Where are the medics?
It's okay. It's okay, Cal.
Stay with me, Cal.
Stay with me. It's okay. Hurry up!
Okay. Okay. Look at me.
It's okay, look at me.
I can't feel my legs.
[Sofia] The paralysis is temporary.
What's the bad news?
It caused a neurological split, but we got you through it.
This time.
I'm gonna die in here, aren't I?
No.
Not if you go in there of your own free will.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
The Apple...
you're the only one left who can find it.
We can put an end to pain, Cal.
For everyone.
-Where'd you get this? -My father recovered it
from the scene of your mother's murder.
And brought it here for safekeeping.
Safekeeping?
You stole it.
It's your mother's necklace. I wanted you to have it.
Why was he there?
To save her.
-From who? -Her own people.
What's it got to do with you?
Assassins and Templars have been at war for centuries.
I aim to change that.
That's right, I forgot.
We're here to combat aggression.
I don't think I like your methods.
I'm a scientist.
I'm here to be cured of violence.
Who's gonna cure you?
We're feeding the beast.
We're making him stronger.
I'm Dr. Rikkin.
Alan.
I look after things here in Abstergo.
Like to keep things in the family, huh?
Yes.
I'm sorry if we've caused you any discomfort.
-Is there anything I can do? -How about you let me out of here?
That's something I can't manage.
I'm here to make a deal.
We need the Apple.
And we need you to get it for us.
You've been desynching in the Animus.
We need you not to do that.
Sending me back to the machine?
No.
You've already shown us what we needed to see.
Will you let us free then?
What do you hope to gain from the newcomer?
Something that'll benefit us all.
You too, Moussa.
What have you done to them?
[Rikkin] It's what happens if you don't enter a regression
[Rikkin] It's what happens if you don't enter a regression of your own volition.
Do you recognize this?
It's an Assassin's blade.
This is the actual one...
that your father used to take your mother's life.
He's here, you know.
A mother's death, Cal...
Not something a boy should ever be made to see.
This is wrong.
You left me no choice.
He has to go in of his own free will, you said that.
I had to negotiate.
You mean manipulate.
I assured the Elders we would have the Apple for London.
That's in two days.
He doesn't want to know his past or his father.
He wants to destroy them both.
We're not in the business of creating monsters.
We've neither created them nor destroyed them. We've merely abandoned them to their own inexorable fate.
We've merely abandoned them to their own inexorable fate.
You're your mother's son.
What does that mean?
The blood that flows through you is not your own.
It belongs to the Creed.
Your mother knew that.
She died so the Creed may live.
Remind me how, exactly.
What you saw...
I did.
You murdered her.
I took her life rather than have it stolen by that machine.
A man grows with the greatness of his task.
I ought to have killed you.
I couldn't.
Well, here.
Take it.
Do what you couldn't do 30 years ago.
It's in your hands now, Cal.
This is what they want.
Spill my blood...
but do not go back into the Animus.
Why?
The Apple...
contains the genetic code for free will.
They will use it to destroy us.
I'm gonna find it...
and watch them destroy you...
and your Creed.
You cannot kill the Creed.
It's in your blood.
The Apple is everything.
Your mother died to protect it.
She had no choice.
I do.
You're gonna kill the Creed!
Take me to the Animus.
Put me in.
[Sofia] Prepare the Animus.
Voluntary regression.
Do you know how Assassins came to be named?
From an Arabic word.
"Hashashin."
They were society's outcasts...
those who stole...
who murdered in cold blood.
People ridiculed them.
Rebels, fools, drug addicts.
But they were wise.
They used this reputation...
to hide a dedication to principles...
beyond those of even their strongest enemies.
And for that...
I admire them.
But you're not one of those men...
are you?
Let's find out.
[man] Commencing regression.
This is my life's work.
It's my life.
[in Spanish] For the Creed.
Our own lives are nothing.
All that matters is what we leave behind.
[Torquemada in Spanish] Sultan...
Surrender the Apple.
Your Assassin protectors are gone.
The Creed is finished.
[in Spanish] My son.
Here lies the seed of man's first disobedience
of free will itself.
Thanks to the Apple of Eden
the known world
will be ushered into a new age
one of peace
in which all the warring populations of mankind
shall bow in perfect obedience
to our one Templar rule.
[in Spanish] The Apple.
Give it to him
now
[in Spanish] For the Creed.
Go.
[in Spanish] Forgive me.
[in Spanish] It's over.
Leap of Faith.
Where are we?
[man] It looks like a military port.
Cádiz, Palos de la Frontera.
[in Spanish] Assassins have died for this
protect it with your life.
[in Spanish] I am a friend of the Creed.
Take it to your grave.
I swear.
What is it? Translation?
[man] "Following the light of the sun, I shall leave this old world behind."
It's Christopher Columbus.
Where is he buried?
His remains were returned to Spain.
His tomb is in Seville Cathedral.
We found it.
[Moussa] Hey, All Stars. Come here.
Pick one.
Any one.
Breach in the common room!
Seal the Animus.
Is it a memory?
[man] No.
Come on!
Transport?
Standing by.
Protect the Animus. Purge the facility.
I need to get you out of here first.
No!
We have to leave, Sofia.
No!
No!
You're not alone, Cal.
You never were.
-Wake and bake, my protector. -Come on.
[Cal's mother] Where other men... blindly follow the truth...
remember...
Nothing is true.
Where other men are limited... by their morality or law...
remember...
Everything is permitted.
We work in the darkness to serve the light.
We are Assassins.
What now, pioneer?
We fight.
Your Excellency.
All the glory will go to your father.
But we both know who found it.
Your time will come, my child.
[Rikkin] They'll give you a Nobel Peace Prize for this.
Better start writing your speech.
I've read yours.
And?
"If we eradicate free will, we eradicate the Assassins...
the cancer that has menaced society for centuries."
It's not my best work...
but it gets the point across.
We've been looking for solutions.
You've eliminated the problem.
[Sofia] So my program...
Has brought order to society for the first time.
I'm accountable for this.
You've already been accounted for.
Our work belongs to the Elders.
This is their finest hour.
You lied to me.
I've always known that in your heart...
you were a scientist first and a Templar second.
Your recent work has impressed us much...
but it has confirmed our belief that mankind...
cannot be redeemed.
So you've thought of everything.
Not quite. My speech...
it could do with one of your elegant openings.
"Now I am become death...
the destroyer of worlds."
Not sure I could make that work.
It is with great pleasure tonight... that I introduce the architect of our ancient Order's future.
that I introduce the architect of our ancient Order's future.
Please welcome the CEO of the Abstergo Foundation...
Dr. Alan Rikkin.
[Rikkin] With the recovery of the Apple...
we are now in possession...
of a complete genetic roadmap to humanity's instincts.
Any impulse towards independence...
resistance or rebellion...
will be crushed.
Any predisposition that might oppose our march of progress...
can now be eradicated.
All I have to do is shout.
I'm here to help you.
And you're here to help me.
I can't help you anymore.
What about all those great plans?
Cure violence.
Combat aggression.
That's not going to happen.
You started this, Sofie.
You don't get to walk away.
We both know what happens next.
Not everything deserves to live.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
But it is not to ourselves, but to the future...
that we must give glory.
A future purged of the Assassin's Creed.
Ladies and gentlemen...
the Apple of Eden.
I did this.
I will retrieve the Artifact for the Elders.
How are you feeling?
Wait. What?
It's perfectly normal to feel confused.
You just spent 120 years in suspended animation.
What?
It's okay, James.
-[softly] It's Jim. -Jim.
Just breathe. Everything is okay.
Where am I?
You're a passenger on the Starship Avalon,
the Homestead Company's premier interstellar starliner.
We've nearly completed the voyage from Earth to your new home.
The colony world of Homestead II.
A new world. A fresh start. Room to grow.
[whispers] Yeah.
The Avalon is on final approach.
For the next four months, you'll enjoy space travel at its most luxurious.
Food. Fun. Friends.
-My friends. -That's right, Jim.
The ID band on your wrist is your key to the wonders of the Avalon.
You're in perfect health, Jim.
Let's get you to your cabin, where you can get some rest.
[attendant] You may be experiencing post-hibernation sickness.
Your door will illuminate for you.
Welcome to your cabin, your home until we make landfall.
Over the next four months, you'll prepare for your new life on Homestead II,
meet your fellow passengers, take skill-building classes,
and learn about colonial living.
You've been assigned to learning group 38
for passengers with engineering and technical trade skills.
Please scan your ID to confirm luggage delivery.
Jim.
Please scan your ID to confirm luggage delivery.
To help you recover from hibernation, be sure to drink plenty of fluids.
Enjoy the rest of your voyage on the Avalon,
a Homestead Company Starship.
[Deejay] Good morning, one and all.
It's a beautiful morning here on the Starship Avalon.
Whatever you do, don't get homesick, get Homestead.
Let's start things off with one of my favorites back on Earth.
No.
That's stupid.
Just own it. Own it, Jim. You got a cool jacket.
Hello, passengers.
Will you all please take a seat?
Welcome, learning group 38.
Your introduction to colonial life.
Earth is a prosperous planet, the cradle of civilization.
But for many, it's also overpopulated, overpriced, overrated.
I'm sorry, I think I may be in the wrong...
Hold all questions till the end, please. Sorry.
The colonies offer an alternative, a better way of life.
Where are all the other...
And there's no colony more beautiful than Homestead II,
the jewel of the occupied world.
[chuckles] I'm sorry. Where is everybody?
We are all on the Starship Avalon.
But I'm the only one here.
There are 5,000 passengers and 258 crew members.
So why am I alone?
We're all in this together.
Hello?
Anybody here?
Hello?
[Avalon] Please buckle up and secure any loose items.
This elevator will experience a momentary lapse in gravity.
[Avalon] Grand concourse.
[Infomat] Hello.
Welcome to the grand concourse aboard the Avalon. Can I help you?
I need to talk to a person. A real live person, please?
What sort of person? Personal trainer? Travel planner?
-Therapist? -I don't know. Somebody in charge.
The ship's steward handles passenger affairs.
It's on level three of the grand concourse.
-Thank you. -Happy to help.
Not good. -[Infomat] Hello. -Who's flying the ship?
-[Infomat] Hello. -Who's flying the ship? The flight crew, the captain, the pilot, the chief navigator...
The flight crew, the captain, the pilot, the chief navigator... Captain. I want to speak to the captain.
The captain rarely handles passenger queries...
It's an emergency! Please.
The captain is usually found on the bridge, in the command ring.
[Avalon] Bridge access requires special authorization.
Bridge access requires special authorization.
You got to be kidding me.
[observatory] Welcome to the observatory.
What can I show you?
We're supposed to land soon.
I... I'm the only one awake.
I don't understand. What can I show you?
Show me Homestead II.
Homestead II is the fourth planet in the Bhakti System.
Right. And where are we?
We're in transit from Earth to Homestead II.
We will arrive in approximately 90 years. What?
We arrive at Homestead II in 90 years, three weeks, and one day.
No. Wait. How long ago did we leave Earth?
Approximately 30 years ago.
I woke up too soon.
[Infomat] Hello.
How do I send a message to Earth?
Interstellar messages are sent by laser array.
This is an expensive service.
-Bite me. -Happy to help.
[Avalon] Planet and connection?
Earth. The Homestead Company.
There are 30,826 contacts listed under Homestead Company.
I'm emigrating to Homestead II and I have an emergency.
I have a customer help line. Sounds about right.
Begin message.
Hi. I'm Jim Preston.
I'm a passenger on the Avalon.
I think something went wrong with my hibernation pod.
I woke up too soon.
And I mean, way too soon.
Nobody else is awake, and... I don't know how to get back to sleep.
And the thing is, there's 90 years to go.
At this rate, I'm...
I'm sorry, I'm trying to fix this.
Maybe I missed something. I could use a hand.
That's all.
Thank you.
Message sent.
Outstanding.
Message will arrive in 19 years.
Wait, what?
Earliest reply in 55 years.
Fifty-five years?
We apologize for the delay.
That will be $ 6,012.
-Afternoon. -Man!
Is it good to see another face! Thought I was the only one awake.
Who wants to sleep on a beautiful day like this?
No, I mean we're in trouble. We're not supposed to be here.
Well, I won't tell if you don't.
Our little secret.
What can I get for you?
What?
You look like a whiskey man.
Okay.
You're a robot.
Android. Technically.
Arthur's the name.
-Jim. -Pleased to meet you, Jim.
How much do you know about this ship?
I don't know. I know some things.
What do I do if my hibernation pod malfunctions?
Hibernation pods are fail-safe. They never malfunction.
Well, I woke up early.
Can't happen.
How long until we get to Homestead II?
About 90 years or so.
And when are all the passengers supposed to wake up?
Not till the last four months.
How is it that I'm sitting here with you
with 90 years to go?
It's not possible for you to be here.
Well, I am.
[Deejay] Good morning. It's a beautiful day here on the Avalon.
So wake up, sunshine. It's time to relax and enjoy your stay.
[Avalon] Please make a selection.
Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme is reserved for gold-class passengers.
Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme is reserved for...
I want the Mocha Cappuccino Extreme. Bill my room, please.
Food can be purchased in the ship's...
Sorry. The French Roast...
Sorry. The Pumpkin Spice...
Sorry. Vanilla Chai...
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
Large coffee.
-Cream... -Please enjoy your coffee.
Really?
[Avalon] Crew pod room access requires special authorization.
[Avalon] Grand... Going...
Please make... Level...
Grand concourse.
I'm screwed, Arthur. Completely and ridiculously screwed.
Come on, now. Every cloud has a silver lining.
Guess I am gonna die of old age on this ship.
We all die.
Even androids end up on the scrap heap.
I'm your only customer. Why are you always polishing a glass?
Trick of the trade.
Makes people nervous when a bartender just stands there.
So lay some bartender wisdom on me. I'm lost in space here.
You're not where you want to be.
You feel like you're supposed to be somewhere else.
You said it.
Well, say you could snap your fingers and be wherever you wanted to be.
I bet you'd still feel this way.
Not in the right place.
Point is, you can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be
that you forget how to make the most of where you are.
What are you telling me?
Take a break from worrying about what you can't control.
Live a little.
Live a little.
[Avalon] Welcome to the Vienna Suite.
Yeah.
What?
-Yeah! Yeah! -Yeah!
Make that a double jumbo shrimp.
Triple.
Dance-off.
All right.
I did exactly what you just did.
[Avalon] Large coffee.
[waiter] You have had many, señor.
Gracias.
Get out of here!
Come back. Hey.
Come here.
[Avalon] Welcome, Jim.
Please turn your attention to the screens displaying safety tips.
These spacesuits are designed
to withstand the harsh environment of space.
The carbon fiber and polyamide construction means your suit is both flexible and durable.
Remember, your spacesuit is your lifeline.
Slide the handle on the right to release the air pressure.
Your magnetic boots are now engaged.
They can be deactivated using the control panel on your arm.
Press the red button to open the airlock door.
Have a wonderful time.
Tether attached.
[Avalon] Welcome back, Jim.
We hope you decide to join us again soon for another thrilling experience.
Have a wonderful time.
Aurora.
[Avalon] Searching passenger profiles.
I'm Aurora Lane. Passenger 1456. I'm a writer.
I think we tell each other stories to know we're not alone, to make contact.
[man] Your father was Oliver Lane, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author.
No pressure, right?
My dad used to say, "If you live an ordinary life,
My dad used to say, "If you live an ordinary life, all you'll have are ordinary stories.
You have to live a life of adventure."
So...
Here I am.
Good morning.
We're starting over in every way.
I'll have to figure out where to live, how to live, who my friends will be.
It's like the first day of school. If the school bus took 120 years to get there.
We're creating a culture...
You are funny.
Do you ever read something and feel like it's written just for you?
I don't do a lot of reading.
She's good.
Who's that?
Aurora.
The sleeping girl.
You know, I'm not saying the universe is evil, but it sure has a nasty sense of humor.
How is that?
You get to fly to another planet,
but you'll die along the way.
And you find the perfect woman
right in front of you...
Yet she's completely out of reach.
Yeah, I'll miss New York City.
Give me a cup of coffee and a view of the Chrysler Building,
and I can write all day.
They do have coffee on Homestead II, right?
They better have coffee. If they don't, I have to turn around and come back to Earth.
[man] Is there anything you regret leaving behind?
Yeah, I'll miss the trees in Central Park turning in the fall.
I'll also miss crowds...
Say you were trapped on a desert island,
and you had the power to wish somebody there with you.
You wouldn't be alone anymore.
But you'd be stranding the person on the island.
How do you... Would you make that wish?
I don't know. I've never been on an island.
Okay, well, yeah. Forget the island.
Let's say you figured out how to do something
that would make your life a million times better,
but you knew it was wrong and there's no taking it back.
How do you do the math?
Jim, these are not robot questions.
I know how to wake Aurora up.
Well, that seems like a fine idea. You could use some company.
I'd be stranding her on this ship for the rest of her life.
Well, you can't do that.
What am I gonna do?
I'm here for you.
Arthur, you're a machine.
See? You can't feel that. You don't have feelings.
See? That doesn't hurt.
And you don't even mind.
'Cause you're not a person.
Don't even think about it.
No more Aurora talk.
I'm over it. I'm moving on.
Don't even think about it!
What am I gonna do? I'm just gonna sit and think about it?
I can't think about it, so I'm not going to.
That's the deal. I've made my decision. I know what I'm doing.
I just cut it off.
I'm not... No more. You won't hear me bring up her name again.
I'll never even mention her name again.
Done.
You can't do it.
Shaving off my beard.
Please don't do it.
Good morning, Aurora. How are you feeling?
It's perfectly normal to feel confused.
You just spent 120 years in suspended animation.
[Avalon] Grand concourse.
[Aurora] Hello?
Anybody?
Hello.
Hi.
Are you passenger or crew?
Passenger.
Jim Preston.
Aurora Lane.
Do you know what's going on? Nobody else from my row woke up.
Same for me.
The crew's supposed to wake up a month before we do,
but I haven't seen anybody.
The crew is still asleep.
Are you saying nobody's awake?
Just me.
Just you?
It's just us.
But somebody's got to land the ship in a few weeks.
[observatory] We will arrive in approximately 89 years.
Eighty-nine years?
The other passengers aren't late waking up.
We were early.
We need help.
Where's the crew?
[Jim] The crew's in a secure hibernation room.
Everything important, the controls, the reactors, the engines...
It's all behind firewalls. There's no way through.
How long have you been awake?
A year and three weeks.
No. No, no, no. No, this can't be happening.
We have to go back to sleep.
Aurora, we can't.
We just have to get back to our pods and start them up again.
I can't find my pod. I can't find my pod. I can't find my pod. I don't know which...
I can't find my pod. I don't know which... It doesn't matter.
-Aurora... -I can't find it! -Stop. Aurora... -I can't find which one is mine! -Stop. -I don't know which one is mine!
-I'll help you. -I can't...
Stop! It doesn't matter.
[Jim] Putting somebody into hibernation requires special equipment.
Remember the facility where they put us under, all the procedures we went through?
These pods are designed to keep us in hibernation, to wake us up at the right time,
but they can't put us back to sleep.
You don't think there's a way back into hibernation?
No.
But there has to be.
There has to be.
Nine o'clock. Nighttime.
I know I should be working the problem, but...
I can't even keep my eyes open.
You just came out of hibernation.
It's going to be a couple of days before you're 100%. You should get some rest.
Think I'm gonna have to.
I'll walk you to your cabin.
No, it's okay. I'll be all right.
Okay.
Good night, Aurora.
More than a year? I can't imagine.
It must have been so hard for you.
It was.
Good night, Jim.
[Avalon] Please buckle up and secure any loose items.
-Whiskey, neat. -Sure thing.
How's your day been?
Aurora's awake.
Congratulations.
You don't look happy.
Arthur, can you keep a secret?
Jim... I'm not just a bartender, I'm a gentleman.
Don't tell Aurora that I woke her up.
She thinks it was an accident. Let me tell her.
Of course.
How can there be no way to put someone back into hibernation?
What if a pod breaks down?
[Infomat] No hibernation pod has malfunctioned in thousands of interstellar flights.
Well, I'm awake.
Hibernation pods are fail-safe.
Good morning. -Have you eaten? -No. I'm starving.
-Have you eaten? -No. I'm starving.
And this is the dumbest machine.
Happy to help.
[Avalon] Gold-class breakfast.
Well, you're a man of simple tastes.
I'm not a gold-class passenger.
French breakfast puff's above my pay grade.
What? This whole time? -Yeah. -What can I get you?
-Yeah. -What can I get you? -No. No, I'm fine. -Stop it.
Really. Okay.
Here you go.
Yeah.
So, I was thinking, maybe there's another way to go to sleep.
So, I was thinking, maybe there's another way to go to sleep. What about the infirmary?
I checked it out. It's just scanners and an Autodoc.
There could be another hibernation machine in the cargo hold.
I had that thought, too.
And then I read the manifest.
It's mostly farming stuff, machines, and trade goods.
Replacement parts for computers and engineering.
We're not gonna find a hibernation facility in a box.
-We could build our own. -We can't.
Jim, you're not even trying. I have tried everything.
For over a year, I...
I tried everything.
Well, I'm not ready to give up.
[Avalon] Infirmary.
What about research articles? Any kind of technical documents.
[Avalon] Hibernation technology is proprietary.
The following articles deal with the subject on a theoretical level.
New file. My voyage.
I boarded the Avalon with an idea, a destination.
Both now out of reach.
I've been awake for seven days.
Awake far too soon.
And I may well spend the rest of my life here,
in a steel world 1,000 meters long.
There's another passenger awake, a mechanic named Jim Preston.
He seems to have accepted our fate.
But I'm scared.
I'm fighting to stay calm.
All the other passengers will sleep for another 90 years,
while I live out my life on this ship,
traveling forever...
Never arriving...
My only companion a total stranger.
Why did you do it?
Do what?
Emigrate. Leave Earth.
I'm interviewing you.
You're what?
You were the first hibernation failure in the history of space travel.
That makes you a story.
Who you gonna tell? Posterity.
So, why did you give up your life on Earth?
A 120-year space hibernation
means you'll never see your family or friends again.
You'll wake up in a new century on a new planet.
It's the ultimate geographical suicide.
Well, I could ask you the same thing.
But it's my interview.
Were you running away from something?
No. -Everything was okay. -So?
-Everything was okay. -So?
Well, I guess I just wanted a new world, I don't know, a fresh start.
That's Homestead Company advertising.
-Is it? -Jim.
I know. I guess. You're right.
Back on Earth, when something breaks, you don't fix it, you replace it.
The colonies, they have problems to solve.
They're my kind of problems.
And a mechanic is somebody.
This is a new world still being built.
I could build a house and live in it.
Open country. Room to grow.
Now you're back to slogans.
Can't slogans be true?
Do you know how much Homestead Company made off its first planet?
Eight quadrillion dollars.
That's eight million billions.
Colony planets are the biggest business going.
Did you pay full price for your ticket?
No. I'm in a desirable trade.
So they fill your head with dreams, discount your ticket,
So they fill your head with dreams, discount your ticket, and you fly off to populate their planet,
and give Homestead 20% of everything that you make for the rest of your life.
Not to mention the debt you run up on this fancy starship.
So all you see here is 5,000 suckers?
I see zeros on the Homestead Company's bottom line.
I see 5,000 men and women changing their lives.
For 5,000 different reasons. You don't know these people.
I'm a journalist. I know people.
Really?
This one.
Is he a banker, a teacher, or a gardener?
-Banker. -He's a gardener.
And her. Is she a...
And her. Is she a... Madison, Donna, or a Lola?
Donna's too serious for that hair.
Lola.
-Madison. -Shit!
All right, chef, accountant, or midwife?
She has to be a midwife. There's no way you just made that one up.
Yeah. She's a midwife.
I didn't know they still had midwives.
I like her. We'd be friends.
You think you can see that? Don't you?
I do.
-A round-trip ticket? -That's right.
I was gonna fly to Homestead II, live for a year, and then right back to Earth.
I don't get it. I left Earth for a new life,
I don't get it. I left Earth for a new life, but you end up back where you started?
I end up in the future. Two hundred and fifty years in the future,
on Earth, which is still the center of civilization, like it or not.
And I'll be the only writer to ever travel to a colony world and come back.
I'll have a story no one else can tell.
What story?
Humanity's flight to the stars.
The greatest migration in human history.
It's the biggest story there is.
But you won't know any of the people who are reading it.
But they'd be reading it.
Or they would have been.
I'll never write it now.
I don't know if I'll ever write again.
Jim, I can't think of anything else to try
to save us.
And I don't even want to think about it anymore.
What is there to do around here?
-Are you serious? -Dead serious.
-Partner mode. -[video game] Let's get it on!
Come on, get in power mode.
You just stand here. And then we repeat what they do.
Is there anything else we can do?
-Just do the... -Okay. -You don't have to. -Okay. I can...
-[video game] Beat down! -Hey!
Here we go. Let's see it.
-Why you smiling? -Aurora! Aurora!
'Cause I'm up two points.
Who's the lovely lady?
This is Aurora.
Aurora. A pleasure.
-I can't! -You did great!
Okay, one more time. One more time, let's see it.
I swear, I didn't wear pants for a month.
Seven weeks and two days, to be exact.
The man has no shame.
Well, you're a little lacking in that area yourself, Arthur.
I laughed at the man with no pants until I realized I have no legs.
For a minute, I almost forgot my life is in ruins.
I'm sorry.
What for?
I'm gonna go to bed.
Good night.
-All right. -Good night, Aurora.
She is wonderful.
Excellent choice.
Hello.
Hi.
Here you go.
Is he asking me on a date?
Do you need a pen?
She didn't seem that impressed.
"Love to." She wrote, "Love to."
You have a visitor.
Wow.
You clean up pretty good yourself. You went shopping.
I went shoplifting.
Evening. What can I get for you?
I'll have a Manhattan, please.
-Whiskey, rocks. -Coming up.
You two look fine this evening.
Thank you, Arthur. We're on a date.
Very nice.
Took you long enough to ask.
I was giving you space.
Space. The one thing I do not need more of.
That was so good.
It wasn't easy getting a reservation.
They're probably gonna want us to give up our table. I'm getting a lot of dirty looks.
Very popular tonight.
So how's your book coming?
I don't really know what it is yet.
My dad, he used to always write about his life,
but he had stories. He'd sailed around Antarctica.
He was a war reporter.
He had lovers.
He wrote about his daughter.
He wrote about you?
Yeah. I grew up reading about myself in his books.
How was that?
Not always easy.
A little more than you wanted to know about yourself.
And then, when I was 17,
he had a heart attack.
Right at his keypad.
End of story.
That was so serious. I'm sorry.
We need more wine. I like hearing about your life.
Thanks.
Why are we here? You'll see.
Best show in town.
So you've done this before?
Yeah.
And it's safe?
No.
Reasonably safe.
Hop in. You're next.
What about my dress?
Right.
Turn around.
[Avalon] Tether attached.
What are you doing?
Do you trust me?
Thank you.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
You kill me.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
It's just...
Yeah, I know.
[Aurora] So, I'm seeing someone.
You'll never guess who.
We're the last two people in the world who would ever get together.
But here we are. The last two people in the world.
What's that? I'm writing, Arthur. Hush.
Jim and I live in accidental happiness.
Like castaways, making their home on strange shores.
"Strange shores." I love it.
You do? You don't have to say that. -I know. -You're not gonna eat this.
-I know. -You're not gonna eat this.
Does that seem fishy to you?
Keep reading.
It's funny.
We all have dreams.
We plan our futures like we're the captains of our fates.
But we're passengers. We go where fate takes us.
Arthur!
[Aurora] This isn't the life we planned. But it's ours.
And for the first time in my life,
I don't feel alone.
We weren't supposed to find each other.
But we did.
He makes me feel like my life isn't over.
Like it's just beginning.
How was your day?
Good. I wrote a few pages.
Did you find anything that can help us?
-I did. -Are they real?
I cut them myself.
You know, for two unlucky people, we sure got pretty lucky.
[Avalon] Attention.
You may wish to proceed to a viewing area.
The Avalon will slingshot around the star Arcturus.
Look!
Oh, my God!
That was amazing.
A red giant.
The universe's present to you.
What?
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Aurora
Happy birthday to you
[Arthur] A birthday drink for the birthday girl.
Aren't you going to ask for my ID? I might not be old enough to drink.
I would never ask your age in front of a gentleman.
Jim's no gentleman.
Anyway, there's no secrets between me and Jim.
-Is that so? -You heard the lady.
-Is that so? -You heard the lady. I will be right back.
This is a perfect birthday drink. Thank you.
I remember this day a year ago.
Jim was so looking forward to meeting you.
What?
How could he be looking forward to it?
He spent months deciding whether to wake you up.
He couldn't stop talking about you.
Jim woke me up?
Yes.
He said it was the hardest decision of his life.
But I see it worked out just fine.
What?
Did you wake me up?
Yes, I woke you up.
How... How could you do it?
I tried not to.
I'm gonna be sick.
I can't see.
Aurora, please...
Stay away from me!
I can't get off this ship. I can't get off this ship. I can't get off.
No!
Can I talk to you?
[Jim] Aurora,
I know nothing I can say will make this okay.
But please listen.
I was so alone
for so long.
It felt like I was disappearing.
The night I first saw you, I was ready to...
You saved my life.
And I know that's no excuse for what I did.
I read everything you wrote,
and I fell in love with your voice
and with the way your mind works.
I fell in love with you.
And all of a sudden,
it was like I wasn't trapped anymore.
My pointless life suddenly had meaning.
And I wish I could take it back.
But I can't.
Aurora, I don't want to lose you.
I don't care!
I don't care what you want!
I don't care why you woke me up!
You took my life!
[Avalon] Please stand by. Your suite's control center is rebooting.
I envy you, Arthur.
How so?
You have a purpose.
You're always happy.
How's your book coming along?
I've never written about myself before.
I think it's some of the best work I've ever done,
and I don't even know why I'm doing it.
There's only one person who could read it, and I can't stand him.
They say time heals all wounds.
Broken hearts aren't that simple, Arthur.
You wouldn't understand.
[Jim] Arthur!
Tuesday's my day with Arthur.
It's Wednesday.
The bar's all yours.
What'll you have? Whiskey?
Coffee.
Aurora! We love you!
What are we gonna do without you? We'll miss you so...
You're the bravest woman I know.
[crowd] Bye, Aurora!
I promise that I will think of you every day.
When you wake up, I'll be gone,
When you wake up, I'll be gone, but just know that I will never forget you.
You're my best friend.
You were never happy here. I know.
Nothing was ever enough for you.
You know, you don't have to go.
You could do whatever it is you have to do right here.
But... Since you're going, here's my wish.
Since you're going, here's my wish.
I hope you finally find someone who fills your heart,
I hope you finally find someone who fills your heart, and I hope you let him in.
I hope you realize you don't have to do something amazing to be happy.
You know, have fun, take chances.
Um, okay.
I love you, Aurora.
Bye.
Morning, Arthur!
-Coffee, please. -Coming up.
Are you soiling my barstool?
You want to make things, you got to get your hands dirty.
And what have you been making?
Improvements.
[Avalon] Grand concourse.
[Avalon] First floor.
[Avalon] Gold-class breakfast.
[Gus over speaker] This is Deck Chief Gus Mancuso.
Who the hell planted a tree on my ship?
-Who did that? -I did.
Who are you?
Jim Preston.
Aurora Lane.
Anybody else awake?
Just me and him.
How far along are we?
Eighty-eight years to go.
Hibernation failure.
They said that couldn't happen.
Three people, three pod failures.
You have no idea how long I've been trying to get in there.
Now that you're in, don't touch anything.
[Aurora] This is where you work?
No, this is flight crew. I'm a deck chief.
Ops, Navigation, Comm.
-[beep] -[Avalon] Unauthorized personnel.
Sorry.
If I'm reading this right, we're still on course.
So whatever's wrong with the ship, NavCom is still on the job.
There's something wrong with the ship? Three pod failures? Yeah, there's something wrong.
Three pod failures? Yeah, there's something wrong. Question is what.
That's strange.
We should be getting diagnostics from all over the ship right here,
but there's no data.
Got to check all the systems manually.
Can't we turn the ship around, go back to Earth?
No, we're doing 50% of light speed.
Turning back would take just as much time as going on.
Well, there's got to be something we can do.
Sorry. We're going where we're going.
You okay?
Hibernation hangover. Get it all the time.
[Avalon] Grand concourse.
Two years, huh?
Any more trees I need to know about?
-[clack] -Look out!
Never seen that before.
These robots have been breaking down. This guy makes fifteen?
Fifteen.
The breakfast bar went crazy today. -Yeah, and an elevator. -Last week, my door broke.
-Yeah, and an elevator. -Last week, my door broke. -I was trapped in my cabin for two days. -You were?
-I was trapped in my cabin for two days. -You were?
Things like that don't happen. Not on this ship.
There are 16 of these tech stations on every deck.
Dock your slate.
-Data syncs automatically. Got it? -Hmm.
-Yeah. -[Gus] Okay.
You take decks one and two. You take decks three and four.
I'm going down to the hibernation bay, check our pods.
Well, that should be interesting.
Ain't you supposed to be making your rounds?
I'm finished.
I checked your pod.
Problem's very simple. The clock chip's burnt out.
It ain't supposed to happen, but pretty simple.
My pod's more complicated.
Bunch of system failures that all happened at the same time.
Whole damn thing went haywire.
Explains why I'm feeling so bad.
But Aurora's pod...
You did this.
[whispers] Yeah.
All this time, I'm thinking you're one lucky son of a bitch
to get stuck with Aurora.
It wasn't luck, was it?
[whispers] No.
She knows?
She knows.
How long were you alone?
A year.
Still...
Damn.
[Avalon] Data received.
Data received.
-Data received. -Same as Jim's. Interpolating data.
System shutdowns... Everywhere, but no apparent connection.
You saw the hibernation pods?
I saw them.
So you know...
What Jim did.
Yeah.
And? -It's not my... -He woke me up.
-It's not my... -He woke me up.
He took away my life.
I know, and I'm sorry, but there's work I'd...
It's murder.
You're right, Aurora.
But the drowning man will always try and drag somebody down with him.
It ain't right, but the man's drowning.
This one makes 16.
[sighs] Yeah.
Hey. You okay?
-You should go rest. -[grunts] Yeah.
But just a couple hours, and then back at it first thing in the morning.
I was in the pool when the gravity gave out.
Are you okay?
We need to find Gus.
-[pounding] -[Aurora] Gus! Gus!
Gravity loss means that whatever's wrong is starting to hit the big-ticket items.
Not good.
Every failure's a burnt out processor. Everything on board's thinking too hard.
Why?
Computer, display these failures over time.
[Avalon] Processing timeline.
Cascade failure.
It started two years ago. Power surge.
Seventeen failures in one day.
Including hibernation pod 1498.
That's me.
Woke me up.
-What happened that day? -Something big.
A major system went down somewhere.
Everything else on board is trying to pick up the load, but the load's too heavy.
Whatever started this, we got to find it. -And fix it. -How bad can this get?
-And fix it. -How bad can this get?
-[beep] -Give me risk analysis based on this data. [Avalon] Extrapolating.
A mission-critical failure is imminent.
Failing systems. Life Support, Fusion Reactor...
So we're stranded. Hibernation Bay, Ion Drive...
On a sinking ship.
[Avalon] Main Engineering.
Not a lot of things big enough to hit this ship that hard.
With Diagnostics out, we'll have to find it ourselves.
-[Jim] Where do we start? -[groans]
-Gus! -[grunts]
[Autodoc] Scan complete. Analyzing data.
[strained] What's it say is wrong with me?
It's a few things.
[Autodoc] 612 disorders found.
Get me out of here.
What's the prognosis?
[Autodoc] Critical diagnoses cannot be discussed without a doctor in attendance.
Override on my authority. ID 2317.
Lay it on me, doc. Pansystemic necrosis.
Progressive organ failure. Cause, unknown.
My goofy hibernation pod. That's the cause.
-What's the treatment? -Various treatments are possible.
None will meaningfully extend the patient's life.
How long have I got?
Your end-of-life transition is already underway.
These sedatives will alleviate your suffering during these final hours.
Gus.
I need a minute.
[Avalon] We are experiencing difficulties in flight.
-Gus! -Gus!
-Where could he be? -[alarm blaring] [Avalon] For your own safety, please return to your cabins.
We are experiencing difficulties in flight.
For your own safety, please return to your cabins.
[weakly] Should've took the damn pills.
-I'll go get them. -No. Stay here with me.
Sit down.
You two take care of each other. [grunts softly]
My ID.
Get you where you need to go.
Fix the ship.
Find out what's wrong with her.
How do I look?
You look magnificent.
[sighs] Ladies love the dress blues.
What do we do now?
This can't be good.
I'm going back to Engineering.
Can you fix this?
I need your help.
-[rumbling] -Let's go.
Arthur!
Let's go.
[Avalon] Main Engineering.
Can't we wake up some of the crew?
It'll take them too long to recover. We don't have that kind of time.
What are we even looking for?
Something broken. Something big.
Come on.
Is it broken? It seems okay. What's next?
It seems okay. What's next? Power plant. This way.
-[electronic chime] -[alarm buzzes] -Come on. -[chimes and buzzes]
The whole section's closed off. Something's wrong.
We're looking for wrong. Try to open it.
[Avalon] Warning.
Pressure fault. Lockdown initiated.
-Please secure all doors. -Hold on!
Warning. Dangerous oxygen level.
Please secure all doors.
Dangerous oxygen level.
Please secure all doors.
Grab it!
Pressurizing cabin unsuccessful.
Pressure normalized.
-[gasps] -Oxygen level restored.
-[panting] There's a... -End lockdown.
A hole in the ship.
[Jim] More than one.
How did that even happen? The ship's supposed to be meteor-proof.
[Jim] I guess one got through.
[Jim] It's hot.
[Aurora] I think we found it.
It's the reactor-control computer.
This is what hit us two years ago.
Jim...
How can we fix this?
We're gonna die. There's replacement parts for everything.
-Light. -Sorry.
Soon as I pull this module, the entire computer's gonna shut down.
Well, what happens then?
I'll get it back up as quickly as I can.
Hurry!
-Jim! -[whispers] Okay.
[Avalon] Control computer restored.
Venting reactor.
-But we fixed it! -Reactor vent failed.
Manual override required.
Vent failure.
-Come on! -Jim.
[Avalon] Outer door nonresponsive.
What does that mean?
The outer door is jammed.
We've got to open that door and cool the reactor down,
or the whole ship is gonna blow.
-How? -I got to go out there.
-How? -I got to go out there. Open it from the outside.
I open the door, I get clear.
-You blow that fire into space. -You get clear?
You can talk to me through this.
What happens to you when that door opens?
Heat shield. It might help.
You might need this.
It's gonna be okay.
I better go.
Jim. Jim.
Come back to me.
I can't live on the ship without you.
[Avalon] Warning. Temperature critical.
What's wrong?
What's the matter? -Are you okay? -Nothing.
-Are you okay? -Nothing. -Go. -You sure?
-Go. -You sure?
Go.
I'm at the vent tube.
[Avalon] New anchor point. Reset tether.
I see the door.
[Avalon] Temperature level rising.
[Avalon] Warning. Temperature critical.
Containment unstable.
-Where are you? -I'm at the door.
[Aurora] I'm ready. Just say when.
[Jim] Here goes.
The door won't open.
I'll have to bypass it.
[Avalon] Temperature level rising.
[Aurora] Jim, come on! Please hurry!
-Okay, I'm trying it again. -Tell me when you're clear.
-No! -What?
What's going on?
Jim?
Jim!
The door won't stay open.
I think I have to stay here.
Hold the door open.
No!
No way! Get out of there!
I can't.
Jim.
We're out of time.
-[Avalon] Containment unstable. -Jim?
Vent the reactor.
[Aurora] No! You don't understand!
If I open the door right now, it'll kill you!
I'm hoping not.
Come back in. We'll think of something else. [Jim] There is nothing else.
[Aurora panting] Jim!
-It's okay. -No!
-It's not okay! -Aurora...
[Avalon] Warning. Temperature level exceeded.
This isn't what you said was gonna happen!
Aurora, this ship is gonna go.
I don't care! You die, I die.
There are 5,000 other people on this ship, Aurora.
We have to do this.
[Avalon] Maximum pressure reached.
Do it. Now.
[Avalon] Maximum cabin pressure reached.
[Avalon] Temperature dropping.
Jim.
-Jim? -[Avalon] Vent successful.
-Jim? -[Avalon] Vent successful. Rebooting process initiated.
[Aurora] Jim, please say something.
-[Avalon] Suit pressure dropping. -[air hissing]
Return to ship immediately.
-[beep] -Aurora?
It worked! You did it! You can come in!
Yeah, about that.
What's the matter? Are you hurt?
I got blown out of the tube.
-What? -My tether broke.
I can't get back to the ship.
I'll come out. I'll come out. I'll pull you in.
[Avalon] Warning. Oxygen level critical.
Return to ship immediately.
Aurora, I'm sorry.
For everything.
Shut up. I'm coming.
[Jim] I wish we'd have met in 90 years.
I'd have built you a house.
I'd have read your book.
It's gonna be great.
[Avalon] Tether attached.
[Aurora] Locate Jim Preston.
[Avalon] Jim Preston located.
I'm coming to get you.
Jim!
[Autodoc] I'm sorry. The patient is dead.
Well, resuscitate him!
Postmortem operations require authorized medical supervision.
[crying] No.
Jim.
-[beeps] -Override!
Override on my authority! ID 1-7...
ID 1-7...
Two... Two. Two.
[softly] God, 2-3-1-7.
2-3-1-7! ID 2-3-1-7!
Resuscitation.
[Autodoc] Multiple procedures are not recommended.
Override! Do it now!
Executing.
[laughing] Jim!
Hey, Jim.
[softly] You brought me back.
Yeah.
-Thank you. -Be still.
Of course.
There's something I have to show you.
In command mode, it turns out
the Autodoc has an option called Stabilize and Suspend.
It stops all metabolic activity.
What are you saying?
With Gus's ID, it can be like hibernation inside the Autodoc.
You can go back to sleep.
But there's only one Autodoc.
Yeah.
And you're gonna lay down in it...
And fall asleep.
And you'll wake up on Homestead II.
And you'll write your book.
You'd finish your journey. You'd do what you set out to do.
You'd be alone.
I've been alone before. And I'll be fine.
But I would never see you again.
I'll come and visit you.
[Aurora] Tuesday is my day with Arthur.
[Arthur] Lovely as ever.
Thank you, Arthur. You're looking very well yourself.
Thanks to you.
What's that?
Something I've wanted to give you for a long time.
It's beautiful.
Took you long enough to ask.
Champagne.
I'll wait.
[whispers] Hell of a life.
[whispers] Hell of a life.
[Avalon] Crew wake-up process initiated.
[Aurora] My fellow passengers,
if you're reading this,
then the Starship Avalon has reached its destination.
[Avalon] Grand concourse.
[Aurora] A lot happened while you slept.
A friend once said,
"You can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be
that you forget to make the most of where you are."
We got lost along the way.
But we found each other.
taken over the guns, taken over the syndicates.
So he has become so powerful.
He's the most notorious killer of elephants in this country ever known.
We have intelligence that Shetani and his poaching syndicates
are in this village.
[in Swahili] Open up. Police.
[in Swahili] Where is Shetani?
-Where is he? -Show us where your gun is.
Where is Shetani? Tell me!
Why aren't you giving him up?
You, get ready to shoot him.
[Elisifa, in English] Shetani employs these men to kill elephants.
So, we must get Shetani, at any cost, at any risk.
This is it. It is an elephant-killing gun.
[in Swahili] I was just given this gun.
[in Swahili] I was just given this gun. This man is an elephant tusk carrier.
[in English] Shetani became too clever.
We were trying to lay traps.
Before we laid our hands on him, he disappeared.
[Craig] Delta Uniform from Charlie One.
[in Swahili] Have you seen One Ton?
[man on radio, in Swahili] I saw another group,
but One Ton wasn't there.
Thanks.
[in English] Okay, so, they still haven't seen One Ton, and they've done a full circle around the area where he was.
and they've done a full circle around the area where he was.
He's the biggest elephant we've got left.
We lost one of his colleagues earlier in the year.
He died just about 500 meters down that way
after a poison arrow.
[Craig] Every elephant is at risk at the moment,
even the female and calves with only a couple of kilos.
A poacher will still make a bit of money for that for his effort.
Every time something bad happens, you're losing much, much more
than just an individual animal,
because elephants have an amazing memory,
and they can live 60, 70 years,
and the passing down of knowledge and experience
is something that is amazing to witness.
Calves learn everything they do from their mothers,
and they're much more connected to each other
than even humans are these days.
[Craig, whispering] This is One Ton.
And it's good news, because he's just been up into the hills
and down the other side into an area which is quite dangerous.
He's made a little friend. I'm not sure how they met,
but they're oddly attached.
He's really relaxed, but the little one can get quite fierce.
So we've just got to be a little bit careful with him.
One Ton's left tusk is probably two meters long.
He's got at least 70, 80 kilos of ivory on him.
You're talking top 20 in the world, probably.
I've heard stories about elephants hiding their tusks,
but I've seen him do it once.
Specifically, when they know humans are watching them,
they hide their tusks because they know their tusks are valuable.
They're definitely intelligent enough to figure it out.
Any poacher would risk his life happily to get an animal like this.
[man, in Swahili] My officers will search on this side of the hill.
I will look with the Land Cruiser.
[in Swahili] If they find any tracks or a carcass,
we will decide how to respond.
[Craig, in English] About seven o'clock this evening,
ten shots were heard by a mobile unit.
We don't know what's happened yet. It's pitch black,
so we're trying to find the scene. It's gonna be really tough.
No matter how many men we have, no matter how many guns we have,
every time that happens, you just feel like you're fighting against--
fighting against an avalanche that there's no way you can stop.
So, we don't really know if there is a carcass.
They might still be here, which is why it's still pretty dangerous in there.
The poacher's prepared to shoot at you,
and you have to be prepared to shoot back.
If you don't realize that, then you need to go somewhere else.
[in Swahili] Let's follow it up the road.
But it was two people.
Yes, they were two people.
[Craig, in English] We still don't really know what happened,
so we're bringing in air support to provide us GPS coordinates
to send teams in straight away,
but the thickness of the bush and the size of the area
means it can take weeks to find the carcass.
Elephants cannot protect themselves
against a concentrated effort to poach them.
No matter what they do,
firearms and poachers will win every time.
So, everything we do
is aimed at helping those elephants fight back.
But the reality is, at the moment, we're everything they've got.
And without us, they're dying all over the continent.
This little statue, it's about $10,000.
And this beautiful sword here,
this is $200,000.
And this tusk here, painted, is a bit less-- 170, 180.
She told me the price is already been 20 per cent higher than--
than the former years.
[Andrea] Can you ask her how heavy is the weight?
-More than 15 kilos. -Fifteen kilos. Yeah, okay.
So, this piece is around $330,000.
I saw many dead elephants in my life, unfortunately.
The first one was a little elephant called Zambezi.
He was hacked. I had literally tears in my eyes.
And from that moment, I basically devoted my life
to try to make a difference.
The reason why thousands and thousands of elephants
are slaughtered every year
is because we have a legal market in China.
The problem is that the legal market can rely
only on the small quantity of ivory
that the Chinese government distributes every year.
It's about five tons. It's not enough, five tons.
The demand is much higher.
So, they actually have to work illegal ivory.
Imagine to have, in Europe, a legal market for cocaine or heroin.
It would be really easy to launder cocaine and sell it as legal.
When you find, in a shop, cocaine, it is legal or illegal.
With ivory, it's happening exactly the same.
You have a legal market
for something that is basically illegal all over the world.
We are talking about hundreds of tons of ivory
getting into mainland China every year.
Ivory trafficking is a serious business.
There are powerful individuals that are making a lot of money,
and they are able to control politicians, security officers,
so you don't easily go to police to report a crime.
It's extremely dangerous. You risk your life.
You cannot trust anyone.
That's why we set up WildLeaks, the first initiative in the world
dedicated to wildlife crime whistleblowers.
I'm launching the Tor browser.
[man on phone] It was uploaded yesterday.
We don't know where it's from yet.
All right.
-Okay, you see it? -One sec.
What is this? There's no message, there's--
there's just this video. Like, it's a pile of ivory.
Wow.
There is a gigantic tusk. Unbelievable.
[Andrea] We received a submission through the Tor platform.
So, completely anonymous.
Tor is a technology developed by the U.S. Navy,
so it's impossible to trace back your connection to us.
I see some--
some numbers and--
R149039.
[man on phone] They obviously have access to some stuff.
Can you share this video with a couple of our most trusted collaborators?
-You know who. -Okay.
They might help us to check all these numbers
and all these written parts on the tusks.
We'll get on it right now.
Okay, I'll call you tomorrow at this time.
-All right, bye. -Okay. Bye, Mike.
[Craig] Elephants are pretty amazing, really.
They have feelings like a human.
And their reactions to the deaths of other elephants
shows clearly that the feelings they have for one another
goes far beyond our understanding.
Elephants revisit scenes of where another elephant's died.
They can feel the bones, they smell the ivory
if it's still there.
They've been known to go and collect tusks
that have been taken away from a carcass
and return them back to the same carcass,
and there's clearly a lot more going on in an elephant's brain
than anyone's ever realized.
I'm--
You can see how close together they all are.
The poachers must've had a real set-up ambush.
Whether the elephants sensed danger before they--
before the poachers started shooting, we won't know.
But as soon as they did, they would've all clustered together to--
just to protect the babies.
You know, we found more than ten cartridges here.
Who knows how many they picked up.
The poachers from southern Tanzania now seem to be spreading out a bit.
This gang, we know there were three Kenyans, four Tanzanians.
So, very professional, knew exactly what they were doing.
Horrible thing to think, a whole family all clustered together, and...
he probably wasn't even aiming.
She would've been the first to go down, whereas that one...
obviously got wounded a little bit and managed to run 20 or so meters.
Not far enough, though.
[Craig] Traders in ivory actually want extinction of elephants,
and that is probably the biggest danger.
The less elephants there are, the more the price rises.
The more the price rises, the more people want to kill them.
And this is an ever-ongoing circle
that is just gonna end up bringing about exactly what they want:
Extinction.
[Elisifa] I've just sent you a message.
Yeah, this is a very important informer,
because he's going to assist us to get to the culprits
for the Tsavo killing at the border between Kenya and Tanzania
in Manyara, all right?
Okay.
Of course, the biggest one that we are seriously looking for
is Boniface Mariango, alias Shetani.
His actual photograph we haven't got,
but his physical appearance we can describe.
We are running more than six informants now, working on him,
for every movement he makes.
The nickname "Shetani" means "the devil,"
and he's not easy to--
The name is derived from his cruelty, particularly.
One collection from him can range between 500 kilograms
to 1,000, 2,000, up to 3,000 kilos of ivory.
He's the number-one wanted poacher right now,
responsible for more than 10,000 elephants as a single man.
He is Maasai by tribe, a Christian, 64 years.
He is living at Makame, Kiteto.
[Elisifa] 64 years old.
He can still carry a gun and kill an elephant.
Jesus Christ.
Each tusk here weighs 15 kilograms.
This suggests that this was a very big elephant.
If it was a "she," she was still productive.
We must have lost several elephant babies
by the killing of this elephant.
It's a loss to our country.
[speaking Swahili] How many shillings did you get for it?
-250 USD. -Per kilo?
No, for everything.
That's about $7.
Seven dollars a kilo.
In China, this would fetch $3,000 a kilo.
So, this old man, with all these hardships he's facing in the bush,
and the life he's risking in the bush,
when he sells these products to Shetani
in his luxurious house in Dar es Salaam, where he has a posh house,
he's getting only six per cent,
while Shetani goes away with 94 per cent.
If he continues this business,
there's no chance for the sons and daughters,
or his grandsons and granddaughters, to find an elephant in this country.
They can only hear of an elephant in the history books
and see elephants in pictures.
We had over 100,000 elephants,
only to come down to less than 50,000 within five years.
We cannot sit down and look at this happening.
It pains me a lot to see these greedy men
who just want to get easy money
by merely killing, ruthlessly,
these animals.
Pains me a lot.
[Hongxiang] In the past, it's always, like, white people are the good guys,
the local black people are the bad guys,
and the Chinese people are the extremely bad guys.
And I think it would be different if this time
we could have some Chinese actually being the good guys
in this ivory war.
Since I was very small, I always have a strong passion for animals,
because every time, on my way to the primary school,
we would pass a market that people sell, like, live animals
and slaughter them right there.
Every time I pass there, I feel very sad
to see the small animals being slaughtered.
So, I guess from then on, I already have a wish
that someday I wish I can protect the animals that I love.
Because I had this experience as a Chinese journalist
doing undercover work in Africa,
Ofir is now one of the best persons for me to work with.
He's professional. He's been doing these undercover investigations
for, what, ten years.
So, he really has a lot of experience.
Although, sometimes he seems a little bit crazy,
but still, I believe he's going to try to make this as safe as possible.
Every target that we have came through an investigation
that was in the heart of five different syndicates.
These are people who are handling containers of ivory.
Hong is a very independent individualist.
He's very creative. That's also another quality
that's very important in an investigator.
And he has a strong motivation. But it needs a lot of polishing,
and we need to see if it works. So, there is still a long way.
And, as we say, you use business words.
We're trying to expand. We do timber, we do some minerals.
I do a lot of work in West Africa.
[Hongxiang] Well, I prefer to stay South and East Africa.
That's a place that I have, actually, knowledge.
West Africa--
No, because South and East Africa is where he has knowledge,
so he can check you out.
Okay? Makes sense?
[Hongxiang] I was given a list of names,
and they are all major traffickers in Uganda.
My mission is to use myself and my partner as bait
to get them to show us the ivory that they have,
and then get them arrested.
Moving too much is difficult.
No, I think it's very okay.
When they say "white," that means ivory.
And if they say "black", it means the rhino horn.
[Ofir] I want to review your targets one by one.
-This is the last meeting, right? -Yeah, yeah.
-She's already there. -Okay, we'll start with the phone calls.
[Hongxiang] Hello, Joshua.
Do you have any ivory, especially raw ivory?
Because, you see, I have this great connection
with someone in China who is looking for ivory right now in Beijing.
So, do you have ivory right now, also?
Two hundred kilograms, with you?
Okay, no problem. So, give me back the phone to Juliette.
Hello, Juliette. So, you are now going with them.
Make sure you use our own car, because this could be a trap, okay?
So, how--
[Ofir] "The driver wants to know where you are."
[Hongxiang] Okay, so, the driver has asked me--
like, where are you right now? So, you are still in the car?
[Juliette] Yeah.
Have you seen the merchandise?
It's in sacks. In sacks.
So, do you think Mr. Joshua is serious?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You hear me well? Shit.
Listen to me. You're heading for an arrest.
And what will happen is that we bring another car,
which will be a four-by-four, white.
When it comes in, it will have a Chinese guy,
which is our guy.
And they'll move after him wherever he goes
to conduct the arrest immediately when products are being seen.
Listen to me, I will insist,
because as a Chinese, I won't go into that place.
They have to take the things.
I understand, but I doubt they will.
I understand you, but I doubt they will. Okay?
And Tinka is armed. He has a pistol.
-Okay? -Yeah.
[Hongxiang] You are going to meet the criminals,
and you don't know what is going to happen,
whether they will spot your hidden camera,
whether they will bring someone to search you,
whether they will-- well, whether they will actually shoot you
if they find out that you are investigators.
And you are the one who is going to be alone facing the traffickers.
Hello?
Hello? Yes?
They are bringing the merchandise here for me to see in my car.
And there will be a car coming here, bringing the merchandise.
Okay.
And we're seeing the car. Ask the policemen to be ready.
-Say it again? -Wait a second.
I need to make sure that this--
Juliette. Juliette, come to me.
Ask Tinka to come out of the car. Just stay here.
I was very afraid. So, he took the things
to the car to show us.
Wow.
And then you have the arrest.
[man] Shoot! Shoot!
Shoot!
We're going to cuff you.
Where are the cuffs? Where are the cuffs?
[Hongxiang] I feel quite satisfied with this operation
because local criminals, they seldom suspect me.
Because, unfortunately, they just never imagine,
like, a Chinese could be on the right side
of the ivory and rhino horn battle.
So, I realize, "Oh, this time I can make some difference.
I can be part of the change-makers."
[Richard] This is the real trouble area.
It's not surprising. There's no barrier at all
-to stop the elephants coming in. -[indistinct chatter]
If there's one place made for elephant conflict, this is it.
Must be so tempting for them coming into all this maize.
There's no water. They don't have an option.
-They've got to come here. -Yeah.
Where the heck have they gone?
-Over there. -An elephant?
Yeah.
-Those-- -A lot of them?
-Should we go around and have a look? -Yeah, a couple.
-On that side. -There's a cow-calf herd.
Nice herd.
[Richard] Yeah, they're the ones the guys have been complaining about.
I wonder how many elephants have died,
that have been speared coming into these farms.
That's him with them.
-Let's go around and have a look. -There's a big tusker with them.
I think it's him.
[Richard] Look at that. Beauty.
He's on his way to the farm.
By eight o'clock tonight, they'll be right here.
[Craig] It's people and wildlife living in the same place.
When elephants are damaging areas of farmland,
that farmer is not going to view an elephant positively.
And as long as that continues to happen,
poaching is gonna be something that's accepted.
At the very least,
it's getting rid of something that's ruining your livelihood.
We got a call saying there are elephants up in the farm.
"You guys need to hurry. There's a lot of people coming,
and they're all getting-- They're just sick of it,
and they're gonna kill an elephant, or as many as they can get."
The ellies were just here.
They were obviously here about five minutes ago.
Two different groups. Possibly, Tim's in one of them.
[man, speaking Swahili] We just saw a lot of them there.
They are right there.
The ellies are already pretty pissed off. You can see there's a big group of people,
about 15 or 20 of them, trying to chase them out,
shouting and screaming.
So, they're not in a good mood.
You can hear them rumbling and screeching to each other.
So, we've just got to keep our distance,
and then we can hopefully push them pretty quick.
I'd rather we do it than they do it.
Either one of those will get wounded, or one of them's gonna injure an elephant.
And if one of them gets wounded,
then they demand we shoot an elephant, which is ridiculous,
but that's what happens.
[in Swahili] Today, this elephant, we will kill!
Yes!
[Craig, in English] You look at any one of those people,
and you know that they could kill an elephant for sure.
And killing an elephant is a real short step
to becoming a full-blown poacher.
Someone shouted elephant over there, and they thought they saw one,
and they've run to go and kill it.
You guys ready to run? We've got to get there
before they cross the road. Follow me.
Keep coming.
-Is it on the fence? -Yeah.
[in Swahili] Here they are.
Throw it! Throw it!
[in English] Yeah, they're running out that way.
Calm down, let's talk!
[speaking Swahili] My fellow men, please listen to me.
Listen, do you see these bananas?
These bananas are for my children, not for elephants.
You see this maize?
It is for my children, not for elephants.
You see these oranges?
They take my children to school, not elephants.
From today, we don't want to see elephants on our farms.
We don't want them, lock them.
And what do you think is the solution?
The solution is to kill them!
A fence.
Electrification.
I agree, but, you know, the fence, it is expensive.
We will ask countries in Europe for help.
But everybody will have to contribute something.
You will have to protect the fence once it is erected.
We'll take care of it.
If you're lying about the fence,
the elephants will be in danger.
The elephants will die!
[Craig] That's exactly what we're scared of.
A wildlife conflict doesn't sound as bad as poaching,
but it doesn't take long for it to become as bad,
and then become poaching.
[man] Hey. Hi, Richard.
No, no, no. Hang on, Richard.
I'm just gonna put you on loudspeaker. I want Craig to hear this.
Come sit here.
[Richard] Yeah, can you hear me?
Yeah, I've got you.
Now, I know this is gonna be bad news. Go ahead.
Yeah, um, well, it's not confirmed,
but I think one of the big tuskers has been nailed.
And, yeah. It's right in the area where Satao--
You know, that big cluster that we've been monitoring for some time.
And you think it's him. Don't tell me.
Yeah, yeah, we saw the carcass, the first carcass,
and then landed and went there on the ground.
Tsavo Trust confirmed that Satao was shot dead by poisoned arrows.
My gut feeling is that 100 per cent it's him.
[male newscaster] Kenya's most famous elephant
in Tsavo East National Park is dead.
The giant elephant had tusks that nearly reached the ground
and is believed to have been one of the world's largest living elephants.
How-- How have we got to this stage as a human race
when we just lay waste to everything?
Anything we value, anything we see, just gets consumed.
I don't know if it's ever gonna make a difference
or if we're ever gonna do enough, but we've got to try.
That's all there is to it, really.
I mean, where do I begin? Look at that.
Thousands of tusks can be hidden in these containers already,
straight from Africa, en route to China,
from here, maybe.
So, that's so sad to see
that the end of these beautiful animals
is here, in a container,
in a rusty container.
I think that Satao can be in any of these containers,
en route to carving factories,
and very soon Satao will be chopsticks, rings.
That's the end of Satao here.
[Andrea] WildLeaks received another leak from the same source
with a very interesting document from Hong Kong Customs
with very interesting addresses here in Hong Kong
of over 100 shops that sell ivory.
Here there is the site. He's licensed to possess.
And they've been doing some funny tricks, you see?
They're blacking out the name. And down here,
they're blacking out the quantity,
the amount that they're allowed to possess.
They're blacking it out.
And they are in Chai Wan, which is on Hong Kong Island,
in the Eastern District.
[Andrea] We need a Chinese investigator,
and I think we have the man-- Hong.
We'll change just five per cent of who you are.
We'll change your name.
[Andrea] Ofir Drori assured me that Hong was the person I was looking for.
It's possible that they're linked to some gangster
and weapons and drugs?
-Yes. -Okay.
In Hong Kong, organized crime is never far away.
-Okay. -Yeah.
The triad activity is just beneath the surface.
Is it plugged in? All right.
That's it. It's working.
[Alex] Wait, the security guard's coming.
Hi.
[Hongxiang] The mystery to me is how this ivory trade network
is really operating.
I really want to find out where are the weak links
that we can break to stop this network.
The only concern I have when I'm acting against the Chinese criminals
is that, because there is strong nationalism in China,
I may be seen as a traitor.
I don't want to be seen as a traitor, because I believe--
I have been fighting so hard for China's positive image.
[Andrea] Deception is a very, very powerful tool.
And Hong, he's very deceptive,
because he can basically go anywhere
and nobody would imagine that he's actually investigating
and recording undercover and stuff like that.
[speaking Cantonese and Mandarin] The shops I have been to before
had so little ivory.
I have several tons, I have four tons.
-Four tons? -Not in the shop, in the storage.
You have four tons?
Yes. What is strange about that?
You must have a huge storage.
Ohh.
[Andrea] Does he have a lot of stock?
It's a lot of money, four tons.
That's a question we asked. Based on what he said,
one ball is, like, at least 1,000 Hong Kong dollars.
Wow.
-There's 2,300 a kilo, right? -Yeah.
And he's sitting on $9.2 million worth of ivory.
A guy like this, you expected to be connected--
you expect him to be connected to the upper layers.
He must be connected to the suppliers and to--
-Somehow, right? -Somehow, yeah.
[Hongxiang] In China, ivory is a luxury item
that some rich people see as a status symbol.
Many people still see animals
as part of the natural resources that they can use.
This is the same as why everyone buy diamonds,
why everyone buys gold.
It is not like in the West
that most people see animals as the living beings that they are.
We are dealing with real ivory investors, speculators,
so they are stockpiling because they are sure
that the price will rise and rise and rise.
That's the future of ivory.
[man, in Mandarin] All my ivory products are legal. When ivory was outlawed back in 1989,
When ivory was outlawed back in 1989, we registered our stock with the Hong Kong government.
we registered our stock with the Hong Kong government.
But the record was not in detail.
So, when we sell ivory, I can now use illegal ivory to fill up my stock.
And ivory can be legalized this way.
The government has absolutely no idea how to regulate this.
[Andrea] This person is explaining the whole process,
and it's unbelievable.
I mean, in itself, it proves
that the system they have here in Hong Kong
is heavily flawed.
So, what do you do?
What do you do? It's-- I mean, personally,
it's-- it's--
I don't sleep at night sometimes because I have this information,
and I don't know with whom I can share it.
And I know that if I share it with the wrong person, bye-bye.
[Elisifa] It is more than fighting a war.
The most difficult part is to identify the enemy.
The business itself is conducted secretly.
The buy is secret, the seller secret, the killer is secret.
So, everything is secret.
Very different from conventional war.
Our main problem is Shetani.
[in English] Shetani has given warning to our unit
that it's either him or us,
meaning he's ready to kill my officers, and my officers know this.
[speaking Swahili] It seems like this town and whole area
is awash with illegal firearms,
and are being used for terrorism as well as poaching.
[Elisifa, in English] We discovered that Shetani
has ordered some guns to Zambia.
We want to arrest those guns before they get out.
Four AK4s and two shotguns.
[speaking Swahili] Hello? Hello? Anybody here?
You, open up!
Police! Open up!
Do you have a gun? Where is it?
[Elisifa, in English] To me, it is not a pleasure
to arrest somebody with ivory.
To me, it's a pleasure to arrest somebody with a gun.
If I can snatch the gun away from him,
I'm protecting the living elephants.
This motorcycle, it is for the bush.
It has no plate number on it.
This is because when they go hunting, they don't want to be recorded.
So they go without the plate number.
Fighting anti-poaching is also saving our country from terrorists.
Some of the poachers, they go hunting for elephants,
sell the ivory, get money,
buy more arms for their jihad war,
which is terror war.
[speaking Swahili] It has a bullet inside.
It's in the chamber.
-Do you know how to use it? -No.
Why is there a bullet in the chamber?
It is a pump-action gun.
See, the bullet is in the chamber.
[Elisifa, in English] Among the bullets that we collected,
there was one with a white coverage.
That was a very strong bullet.
A single one can bring down an elephant,
and the gun here is used for that business.
We have discovered 14 different syndicates,
all belonging to Shetani.
They can go with 1,000 bullets
and 50 AK-47s. They're the hunting group.
So, you can imagine what would happen
if a herd of elephants is found, or is caught up.
You can imagine the kind of massacre that will come out of that.
[Craig] There's only one solution
to bringing human-wildlife conflict under control,
and that's an electric fence.
Without, people are going to kill the elephant.
We've managed to buy some time.
The reality is, if the fences aren't put in very soon,
thousands of people are going to run out of patience.
And no matter what you have in place, thousands of angry people
going out to kill elephant are unstoppable.
I mean, it's a race against time.
At the moment, we're looking at fencing all along there,
and this one's actually ongoing, from Kibwezi to the north of the Chyulus.
-But not on to the Kilimanjaro. -But not on to the Kili, not that one.
So, we've got the same issue, but probably ten years behind you guys,
or 20 years, probably even more.
There's such cool lessons to be learned from Lewa.
You know, because we really were put against the wall.
And it was one old chap called Mountain Bull,
and he would just cut straight across here,
total disregard for fences. When he wanted to go,
-Straight through. -he just went.
But we've got the underpass here under the main road,
and it's only 20 meters wide.
And actually, they put vanilla on the rocks.
Don't ask me why, but elephant like vanilla.
And it drew them in there.
And once one elephant had used it, then everybody started using it.
-Straight away. -It was all pretty simple.
-So, now-- -Yeah, now they're all going through.
[Craig] Ian Craig's an amazing guy.
He's someone who's had decades of experience in conservation,
from anti-poaching to the ivory trade.
You look at him, and he's got his battered shorts and shirt on,
he's wearing his All-Stars and no socks.
But he's got a private line straight to the U.S. government,
the U.K. government and the Royal Family,
and he gets these guys to do what they can to help us.
[Ian] You know, we've put in about $600,000.
We've got a conference call on Monday again.
There are two events in New York.
One is with Hillary Clinton,
where they are coming in behind the EPI.
If we can do that, we've changed the future for elephant,
simple as that, just with the stroke of a pen.
[Ian] There's a collared elephant in that group.
What I'll do is put in an armed team here in the next few days.
You know, these elephants are really vulnerable here.
I see that we're at a watershed on the elephant crisis.
Helicopters and guns and anti-poaching and intelligence,
with all the energy and the best resources in the world,
we can't win this war.
There's simply not enough men to patrol the ground
or cover the ground.
We need a political solution to this problem.
[female newscaster] The country has embarked on an inventory
of national ivory and rhino horn stockpiles.
[man] This is not just a wildlife issue.
It's an economic livelihood issue, it's a security issue,
it's an economic issue, and it's about Kenya's place in the world.
[female newscaster] The inventory process
will yield a digital national ivory and rhino horn database.
This database will be stored on a secure server,
hosted and maintained solely by Kenyan Wildlife Service
and with restricted access.
We definitely will get rid of all of it.
But first of all, we need to know how much we have here.
Yeah, it's not all here.
It's scattered around the country, and it's very difficult.
How many tusks have we done now here?
At the moment, here in Nairobi, we've done over 7,000 pieces.
-7000? -Yeah, 7,000 pieces.
In total, we've inventoried 55 tons.
Because it's an electronic database, we can go back to every piece.
And, Winnie, from here, it's going into shelves?
Yes. Well, ideally, that's what we would like,
but we don't have enough shelf space for all this ivory.
So, we are creating a virtual shelf.
You can see that is shelf number four.
So, we would like to build up shelves--
We don't want to spend too much money. Because if we stop the poaching,
why would we want the shelves?
-That's true. -Perfect. So, no shelves.
-No shelves. -[laughter]
[Ian] There's hundreds of millions of dollars
sitting in these stores in the wrong hands.
There's multiple examples across Africa
of ivory being stolen out of government stockrooms
and for it to be leaked into the black market.
If that ivory doesn't go away, we'll never stop this poaching.
So, we need to destroy it.
To me, these are all just dead animals, they're dead elephant.
They all represent something that should be living and thriving.
And what hits me so hard is, where's the beauty in this,
these dead bodies?
It's just a bag of bones.
That's why I just affiliate so closely with this destruction,
get it out of circulation, kill the demand.
This is the best chance in our lifetime to halt this slaughter.
[Hongxiang] One month ago, I was contacted
by the Wildlife Justice Commission
and Andrea Crosta from WildLeaks.
They told me that, out of the whole world,
they have selected a village called Nhi Khe
to further investigation on.
It's a village that is about 10, 20 kilometers away from Hanoi,
and it's, like, the ivory and rhino horn village.
They have done some previous investigation,
but they never get to understand clearly
what was this village about, what's the role of this village.
[speaking Mandarin] Be careful.
Keep cutting with the knife so that the camera can go inside.
I think that's enough.
[in English] Yes.
[in Mandarin] Put it there and then screw it on.
Yes, screw, screw.
We should put some things here. For example, your tampons.
Okay.
So if people open the bag and see them, they would close the bag immediately.
Our setting is boyfriend and girlfriend,
so we need to act accordingly and naturally.
[Hongxiang, in English] Vietnam is very special to me,
because this is actually the first time I'm taking more charge,
taking more leads inside investigation.
This time, I feel very nervous
because this is the most dangerous mission I have ever been to.
This is, like, a criminal village.
So, imagine if you and your partner, you are caught
right inside this village, what could happen.
[Hongxiang, in Mandarin] So, why is this Nhi Khe village so special?
Why is all the ivory trade only going through there?
[woman] Other villages have potential risks
of getting caught by police.
[Hongxiang] Police don't come to Nhi Khe to arrest people?
[woman] You know, people there have their connections.
[Hongxiang, in English] As we walk into the street,
we see, on both sides of the road,
people are selling, openly, a lot of ivory and rhino horn products.
I just have never, ever seen a place like this.
[in Mandarin] This is rhino horn?
[woman] We had hundreds of kilograms of ivory,
which we just sold this morning.
[Hongxiang] Will they deliver for you?
[man] Yes, they will. It's too risky to take on my own.
[Hongxiang] But how do they manage to transfer it across the border?
They bribe Vietnamese and Chinese police.
If you cannot pay them off, it's a problem.
[Hongxiang, in English] We realize there are some Chinese buyers there.
They are professional ivory dealers,
so we went with them into a house
to meet the traffickers they had already arranged to meet.
[woman, in Mandarin] From where do you import this ivory?
Africa.
[Hongxiang] Can you give us the price of ivory material?
Blood ivory is 1,300 USD per kilogram.
Transportation fee to Hong Kong included, it'll be 1,500 USD per kilogram.
We've been doing this for quite a long time, nothing to worry about.
As soon as we receive the full payment, we'll deliver it to your home.
If you find something wrong about the product, you can get a full refund.
you can get a full refund.
We're not going to cheat you.
[Hongxiang] Will it be dangerous when we receive the products?
Normally there aren't any problems.
But there are always some risks.
After all, it's illegal, so we have to do it secretly.
[Andrea] It's unbelievable.
So, they gave you a bank account at a certain moment, right?
How does it work exactly with the bank account?
In your understanding, it belongs to them, or it belongs to a middleman?
[Hongxiang] The bank account, in my opinion, belongs to them,
because they are all Vietnamese names,
and there is one border city between China and Vietnam,
like, within China.
What they say is, they will open a bank account there,
and then what will happen is,
usually the buyer will pay the money to the bank account,
and then these people would deliver
the ivory and rhino horn to China for them.
A village like this is certainly covered and protected
by corrupt government officials, right? Yep.
It's unbelievable. Unbelievable.
We are talking about millions and millions and millions of dollars,
and a gigantic quantity of ivory keeps getting into China,
keeps getting into this black hole.
As WildLeaks is not easy to operate in China,
but today we are going to engage directly
and meet an anonymous source.
This person sent us a few videos on WildLeaks
with very compromising information
and offered her help to do more.
Internally, we now call this person Omega.
She's Asian, and this is pretty much all I can say.
So, how are you?
[distorted voice] I'm okay.
A lot of traffic?
Yes, as always.
[Andrea] Oh, Jesus Christ.
This guy...
[Omega] This is another room. ...has ivory up to the ceiling.
He has millions of dollars here.
He gave us information that in Beijing area,
they have about 300, 400 little small workshops.
300, 400 workshops? Wow.
Carving the ivory. I said, "Where do they get their stock?"
They actually have one of the top government guys.
In the company?
One of the police guys, or military police guys,
he also runs the business.
Runs the business? So, he--
Of course, because he's part of the politicians, high-rank.
He easily gets the paper, how to sell the ivory.
He totally trusts us. He tells us everything.
It's worth it that we go there and arrange a lunch or dinner.
I'll bring you in, so you're my guest as well.
[Andrea] Exactly.
He's comfortable with foreigners who is in this business.
He knows a lot of Western people
also involved with the illegal ivory trade.
It's not only Chinese people.
[Andrea] The whole operation is built around Omega.
We want to get as much proof as possible on these big players
and show the Chinese government that the illegal trade here in China
is out of hand,
to give them more reasons to close down this evil market.
Actually, I would say that the destiny of elephants
is entirely in the hands of one single person--
the President of China.
So, I think it's the first time in history that one person
has in his hands the destiny of an entire species.
[man] Wildlife crime has transformed
into one of the largest organized criminal activities,
into one of the largest organized criminal activities, alongside with drug trafficking.
[second man] Operation Cobra III, intelligence and information sharing,
registered seizures of 1.3 tons of ivory
and 65 rhino horns in Mozambique.
[Elisifa] The reason why I was looking for you,
I've heard of you also dealing particularly in intelligence gathering.
-I thought that we should share something. -Okay.
I have a professional poacher operating in Mozambique
and all over Tanzania, all over Tanzania.
And of recent, we have intelligence which tells us
-that he's operating in Zambia. -Okay.
This guy is known as Shetani, "the Devil."
His actual photograph, I must admit, we haven't got yet.
-Okay. -But this is the man we're looking for.
He's killing all the elephants.
So, I think that one will also help us.
-I've got his network. -Okay.
This is him here, and you can see Shetani's syndicate.
-These are the people in his syndicate? -Yeah.
He has a new number, which I will forward to your phone.
Use your intelligence and telephone communication providers
to see to whom he could be communicating when he's in Zambia.
[Georgina] Hearing that Shetani is in Zambia
actually scares me,
and now gunshots were heard very close to the national park.
So, this is more than a wake-up call to me.
You know, all along, Zambia has been quiet.
It hasn't experienced serious poaching.
-That's them. -Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, got it. Shit.
They're definitely poached.
That's not the one from the shots, because it's too old.
-It's not from two days ago. -Okay, yeah.
I didn't even know about that one.
-Control, Command 1, Command 1. -Go ahead, over.
Warden, we've just found an elephant carcass. Copy?
-What's that? -Another carcass.
-Another carcass. -A fresher one?
He's spotted another carcass on the right-hand side.
-Was it very fresh? -It's fresh.
[Ian] We've just found another elephant carcass...
[Georgina] When an elephant has been killed,
it actually breaks my heart,
because I imagine how long it has taken for that elephant
to grow to that age,
and then here is someone who just walks in for a few hours
and just guns it down.
It totally breaks me.
I need to get-- I need to get the samples from this one.
The whole head of this elephant is gone, it's missing.
There is no head.
So, it's like they did not remove the ivory immediately from here.
They removed the ivory from another place.
They just had to carry the whole head with them.
I'm now taking the whole thing very personal.
I can't afford to see elephants dying like this.
I can't.
I can't afford that.
[Georgina, speaking Nyanja] How many kilos does he have?
[man, over phone] He said just five. That's what he told me.
Yes, that same five kilos will incriminate him.
You will see how you can buy time.
-Okay. -Okay, okay.
[in English] Thank you, thank you very much.
We have someone who has ivories in Lusaka,
and they would like to sell it, they're in a hurry.
So, I just asked our officer to buy a bit of time
until we return back to Lusaka.
Yeah? Yes, it's an AK-47 one.
Most of the ones made in Zambia have a full metal jacket
made of copper, yeah.
It's a full copper metal jacket, and that doesn't have that. Yeah.
Yeah.
[Georgina] Seeing these bullets that are of foreign origin,
and the information that I have about Shetani,
is very worrisome.
This is now proving Shetani is really getting down
to poaching our elephants in Zambia.
If the guy is not going to open after knocking, then we have to fire.
When this dealer goes in,
is it possible to come and force ourselves--
You can't! It's a very strong gate.
[man] Gentlemen, don't just fire until we tell you to. Wait.
[Georgina] We are now going in. We're going to a battlefield.
Be strong, be vigilant, be alert.
We are going to pounce when they start weighing the ivory.
And then the informer is going to make a call.
We will just let the phone ring, and then officers, immediately,
they will know to say, "It's time to go in."
-Wait, wait. -Where are they going now?
[Georgina] These dealers may very well be connected to Shetani,
because he's not the guy who goes in the field.
He waits with the collectors, the middlepersons, in the pyramid.
They go to him with the ivory.
They are now at the house.
[speaking Nyanja] Guys, come and see your package.
[in English] One, two, three.
[in Nyanja] You are not taking that one?
Can't you see how it is? How can he take it?
It started to decay just like a human being does.
It is $25 per kilogram?
I must calculate.
This is the house on my left.
[in Nyanja] There it is with a guard. This woman needs to be grabbed.
[Georgina] Just be calm.
Just be calm, just be calm. Just be calm, just be calm.
-Just be calm! Just be calm! -[woman arguing]
Uh-uh! [woman, in Nyanja] Why are you grabbing me?
Be quiet! Be quiet!
Come to the car.
-Get in the car! -[shouting]
[in English] Bring your hands.
[in English] Go, go, go, go! [in Nyanja] You, you, you!
Don't run away! You've already been seen. Don't run away!
Sit down!
Sit over there!
There he goes! There he goes!
[man, in Nyanja] You, idiot, you are going to die.
Now climb! Climb!
Climb over and sit down.
[Georgina, in English] We've been following this one.
[man] Stand up.
[woman, in Nyanja] Easy, easy. I'm sick.
What are you sick of? We are all sick!
Let's go.
Just break it open! Let's see why they lock it.
[in English] Where's the light? Light!
Push it this side.
-This is full-length ivory. -Full-length ivory.
-Fresh. Very fresh. -Fresh, yeah.
[in Nyanja] We have been crying that they are killing elephants,
and they are here in this house.
[Georgina, in English] They go in for more than five years
with hard labor.
These are people I don't feel pity for.
They don't feel pity for the elephants or any other animal that they kill.
I don't-- I've got no mercy.
We are in a warzone.
The poachers, the traffickers, each one is trying to win.
So, it is very important that I'm going to be working
with Elisifa of Tanzania.
We're really going to get down to where Shetani and his poachers are.
We are not going to allow them to win the war.
[man, in Swahili] The poachers will try to target the elephants here.
They'll try to shoot them where there's water.
They'll try to shoot them where there's water. We sleep during the day and work at night.
But if the locals keep quiet, nobody will come here.
If they talk, the poachers will come.
[Ian] It's been raining for the last month,
and so all the elephant have moved out of their sort of historical grounds
around the protected areas further east,
and it's moving into a Somali area
where historically there's been a lot of poaching.
And there's less and less presence of government here,
so these elephant are on their own, there's nobody looking after them,
and they're important to us.
To me, every single elephant counts.
These aren't just elephant.
These are individuals with families and relationships.
And so, killing an elephant out of a herd
is much more than just killing an individual animal.
You're destroying a family.
You know, elephant are led by a dominant mother
who is making the decisions of where the elephant go
and when they go.
And if one is to lose that mother figure,
suddenly you're left with teenagers, you're left with young animals
having to make decisions without any historical memory
in a world that is massively dangerous and threatening.
No, it's--
Jesus.
Poor old girl.
Bastards.
Poor old elephant.
Poor elephant.
There.
[man, in Swahili] This is the one that killed it.
It went directly to the heart.
In the end...
as long as ivory's worth money,
these poor animals are going to be annihilated.
And these poachers will keep going till these elephant are dead.
[in Swahili] I'm sorry, mother.
[woman, over speaker] Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to London Heathrow Terminal 5.
Are we really, in our generation,
going to allow the biggest mammal on earth to disappear?
Losing elephant from Africa,
it's just a slower erosion of humanity.
And what's next? We'll lose the rhino,
we're gonna lose the giraffe, we're gonna lose the lion.
Suddenly, we're gonna have an empty world,
full of people, but nothing wild.
My mission is to find good, serious money
to invest into elephant conservation in Africa,
and that money has to come from somewhere.
We need to build fences, we need to put in water,
and just managing elephants costs money.
And yes, it's a national responsibility,
but it's actually a global responsibility.
The world wants elephants.
-No need to try it all on? -I'll get you to try it on.
We just want to make sure it fits perfect.
That's the 16, and I'm gonna grab the 16 1/2 as well.
I just want to make sure it's nice and long enough
so we can see the cuffs. It just looks sharper that way.
[Ian] Putting on suits and ties and this high--
all the froth and bubble around an evening,
it's part of the sight of making conservation important for people.
The Duke of Cambridge has been a personal friend for many years,
and I'll be seeing him today. We'll be talking through it,
all about ivory.
But I'm seeing him as a friend, and I'm just sharing a mutual passion
about what we can do for elephant.
Sadly, Africa continues to face unprecedented challenges
in terms of poaching, driven by the flourishing illegal trade in wildlife parks.
driven by the flourishing illegal trade in wildlife parks.
Africa's elephant population has crashed, from 1.3 million in 1979
to approximately just 400,000 today.
The rangers face grave danger every day.
Over the last ten years, over 1,000 rangers
have given their lives in the name of conservation.
We live in a sorry world
when an elephant requires the sacrifice of a human being
for its own survival.
But these people cannot face the bullets and the threats alone.
It is up to governments and international bodies
to unite behind them,
ensuring that their efforts on the ground are fruitful.
-Let's check the cameras. You have it? -[Omega] I do, I do.
-So, you keep yours in the bag, right? -Yeah.
So... okay.
[Omega] I'll put the camera on the table.
It's like an evening bag, so I leave it on the table.
I have another few friends coming along to the dinner as well.
So that will make the dinner look more relaxed.
He gets to know my other friends as well.
Of course, okay, great. Like so.
All right, let's do it.
[Andrea] Grizzly bear.
It's a blanket made from wolf leg skin.
[Andrea] Ah, from wolf? So, you need a lot of wolves.
[Andrea] Ah, from wolf? So, you need a lot of wolves. Only legs.
Wolf. Wolf skins. They need about 100 wolves.
Yeah.
You see that picture? It's made by butterflies.
-All with butterflies. -From Brazil.
Butterflies are from Brazil.
It's like panda to China. It's kind of like the most first-class,
protected species. You can't even export.
Oh, wow.
[Andrea] Usually they put this...
[Andrea] I'm really happy because he takes us to this unbelievable room
filled with all possible stuffed animals and wildlife products.
So, we are really busting this guy.
And then everything goes wrong.
[man, in Mandarin] Close the door!
Close the door! Where is the camera from?
-Can we talk? -What is this?
[Andrea] Headed to the bathroom.
There you go.
Fuck.
Really, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
It's all happening, like, in ten seconds.
I saw one looking at this bag.
He grabbed the bag, he opened the bag, he found the camera and...
he destroyed the whole bag
and the whole camera with all the wires and everything.
And then there was a moment of, like, ice.
And then, Omega-- I could see it in her eyes,
but she also told me, in order to better protect them,
to get out of that room as soon as possible.
Because if they had decided to check everyone
and then Googled my name,
and then they would've found WildLeaks after five milliseconds.
So, I saw that they were kind of okay with me,
so I asked, "Can I go to the toilet?
Look, I leave here my bag, everything. I just need to go to pee."
So, they let me go, and in the bathroom, in the toilet,
I unwired myself and I put everything here.
So, I have everything here.
Here I have the camera and the mic.
I put it here.
The frustration is that, at this point,
I cannot do anything for her, for them.
I really hope they will find a way to talk themselves out somehow.
Yeah, this is the moment, I think. This is the bag.
And then she found something, and she put it in front of the camera.
Back. And then she grabbed it, and she's probably looking--
"Why she's putting this thing here?" And then they found it.
Now they are checking the bag.
He's checking her phone. He also grabbed the phone.
So, it's just bad luck and clumsiness at the end of a very long day.
That's what it was. But now they're in trouble.
[Andrea] And then I get the message. She is safe. The team is safe.
So, the team got out safely, thank God, because the traffickers thought
we were working undercover with the government,
and they're fucked.
I just talked to Omega, and she's nervous.
We're dealing with the top dealers,
so you don't know with whom they are connected--
with mafia, triads.
It's too risky to stay in the country, so we decided to leave China
as soon as possible.
How are you?
Good, good, good.
So happy to see you.
-Yeah, here's the order. -That's the thing.
All the footage is on this.
Yeah, we need to take action.
It's just the beginning. Yeah, it's just the beginning.
There is a lot of incriminating stuff,
at least enough to trigger local investigations.
And we'll go public with that.
[Omega] I just say yes, go and do it.
I'm really concerned about your safety.
Potentially, your picture can be anywhere.
[Omega] Then I'm just out of it. I go, I just go disappear.
I have to ask you why--
I have to ask you why-- why you are risking your life.
why you are risking your life.
[Omega] I think it's decision-making time for China.
When they see what the traders really are doing,
I think the government will wake up and say,
"Wow, the legal traders are doing illegal stuff."
It's providing government a chance to make it better.
Yeah. Thank you.
We'll do our best.
[Elisifa] Hello, Boni.
What does she know about him?
[Boni, on phone] The suspect is around his home.
Now we are planning to go there.
It's possible to effect an arrest.
Okay, what do you need for this operation? What do you need now?
It is support, support.
Because that guy is armed, and he has many arms there.
I think you should plan carefully, go with some commandos.
The information coming in right now is saying that Shetani has been seen
near his house in Dar es Salaam,
and he will get into his home anytime from now.
[speaking Swahili] Chico, tell Mweko to get three, four officers
to provide cover. They have more guns.
The special forces should be there if they try to run.
[in English] I've been looking for this man
for more than three years.
I've been missing him so many times.
So, I will rush back to Dar es Salaam,
but I will only be excited when I'm told,
"Yes, we have Shetani in our hands."
[speaking Swahili] Hurry up and spread out!
Shetani!
Shetani, we know everything. You understand me?
We already have your vehicle.
Shetani, where are the other cars you use for your ivory?
Don't lie to us!
[Elisifa, in English] I've just received the information
that my hard-core poacher, Boniface Mariango-- Shetani--
has been arrested.
At last, we have him.
Clap hands, men, for the good job.
Good.
[in Swahili] How are you?
I'm fine.
-What's your name? -My name is Mr. Boniface.
Mr. Boniface.
What about your nickname?
-Shetani. -Shetani.
-Speak up. -The Devil without mercy.
The Devil without mercy.
Okay.
[in English] Seeing this man arrested--
Oh, my friend, it was a--
I couldn't believe my ears, neither could I believe my eyes,
until I came close to him and even touched him.
I said, "Yeah, really, we have you."
We know everything about you.
[in Swahili] We know you very well.
We know you better than you know your shirt.
So, it's better you don't argue too much.
When we interview you, just be open.
[Elisifa, in English] When he was arrested,
we managed to get the cars that Shetani owns
and uses in poaching to traffic ivory.
Look, ivory pieces.
[in English] Very good.
[in Swahili] This is not part of the car.
And it looks like some modifications were made by removing this tank.
So, it simply means this car has carriage spaces.
You understand?
-It means all this is for... -Ivory.
[Elisifa, in English] For sure, when we interrogate him,
he's going to unveil to us these international brokers
and traffickers,
but I want to pull as many people as I can on my side.
Because a one-man war can never be won.
But if I can convince other persons
to join me in this fight,
for sure, we can see the number
of these endangered animals
growing again to the old numbers,
where we had over 100,000 elephants in Tanzania.
[woman, over P.A.] Ladies and gentlemen,
we are now descending to Hong Kong International Airport.
Please return to your seat and make sure that your...
[Andrea] It's the final phase of our long investigation here.
We acquired a lot of incriminating evidence
about illegal trafficking.
In Hong Kong, I'll be meeting a member of the local government,
a member of the Parliament,
and I will present all the evidence that we have been, you know,
accumulating in the last year.
Hello. Welcome to Hong Kong.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
We work in the shadow, but at the end of the day,
you have to give what you found to media, to journalists, politicians,
and they have to do their part of the job.
Together, we can really change things.
So, they're literally laundering ivory here in Hong Kong
all the way to China.
It doesn't even stay in Hong Kong, actually.
It goes there.
[Hongxiang] Exposing myself in media and getting my face known
will mean the end of my investigation career.
That will put a lot of risk on myself, on my families,
on my venture, on my colleagues,
and many people have warned me about it.
And I have been quite concerned as well, to be honest.
But at the same time, I think it's very important
to let the world see there are Chinese trying to fight for elephants as well,
trying to fight back.
This could be the turning point of this whole battle for elephants.
From now on, China will be part of the solution.
[woman, in Cantonese] I am very ashamed.
There is always someone who asks me,
"Why is Hong Kong the largest ivory smuggling port in the world?
Why do you Chinese want to buy ivory? What do you use it for?
Why do you Chinese want to buy ivory? What do you use it for? Don't you think it's very cruel,
to kill elephants just for ivory decorations?"
It's not the first time that NGOs and other entities
conduct undercover investigations.
We can now see that ivory traders use their official licenses
to launder illegal ivory.
[Andrea] World press is here, CNN is here, everybody is here.
So, having a politician like Elizabeth Quat,
Member of the Parliament here in Hong Kong,
talking openly about this issue, presenting evidence
and asking for changes,
she will generate huge public pressure.
[in Cantonese] I now call for a complete ban
of the ivory trade in Hong Kong.
When the buying stops, the killing can, too.
[Andrea] Maybe we are very close to a big change.
I feel that the government of China is going to the right direction.
I think we are very close to a total ban of the legal market of ivory in China.
This is the only decision that can save the elephants.
And, yes, I have hope.
For the first time in years, I have hope.
[Kenyatta] Many of these tusks belonged to elephants
which were wantonly slaughtered by criminals.
We want future generations of Kenyans, Africans
and, indeed, the entire world,
to experience the majesty and beauty of these magnificent animals.
Poachers and their enablers
will not have the last word in Kenya.
[Ian] We're training men to kill men to keep elephant alive,
and we don't need to do that.
We just need to get this out of circulation.
I can't really put it in words, what this means, to get rid of this ivory.
But Africa's got 700 tons of ivory. We're burning 15 tons.
So there's a long way to go.
That's some progress. That's progress.
The black market price of ivory is still just going up--
all our information.
So, the threat hasn't changed.
It makes me enormously sad.
Because I don't know exactly how many there are
or what the main tusk weight is. Probably,
upwards towards 1,500 elephants we're looking at behind us.
And if you actually just use your imagination,
think of the number of deaths and suffering,
the animals wounding,
and then the bereavement of the survivors--
it's all there behind us in one great, big stack.
[Ian] This ivory has been moved subversively across continents,
been sold under the table. This is black money.
It's fueling international crime.
This is an international problem. It's not Africa's problem.
The individuals that are fighting this battle,
they can't win it alone. It's too big, it's too complex.
[Craig] Fencing development is the future
when you look at Africa.
There's no choice involved. It's going to happen.
And the people of Africa want the same things that everyone else wants.
They want to be able to have a TV, they want to have a house
which is not knocked over.
They want to be able to store their food in an area
where an animal doesn't get in there and finish it.
Internet, which no one really has here.
And without it, these guys are never gonna agree to living with wildlife
unless they get the best of both worlds.
The United States and China have made a commitment to stop ivory trade.
U.S. President Barack Obama and China President Xi Jinping
announced that they will ban commercial trade of ivory
in their respective countries.
Hi, Amanda.
-[Amanda] Hi. -Oh, my God.
-How are you? -I am, um... I am really good.
-[Amanda] How are you? -I'm good.

Um, that's why I'm licking my teeth a lot right now.
So anyway, I didn't want to hold you, obviously if you have...
-Yeah. -Cool.
-Yeah. Okay. -Um...
-All right. -Yeah.
[softly] Fuck.
-Thirteen cents is your change. -Thanks.
-[cashier] Have a wonderful evening. -Thanks.
-This is my car. So... -It's...
-[Jim] Too weird. -Weird. [chuckles]
[Jim] Hey, do you want to get a coffee?
Maybe?
Sure.
-[Amanda] Yes. -[Jim] Great.
[Jim] Yeah, good.
It's good.
Good. Yeah.
I heard about your mom.
I was really sorry to hear it. Oh, yeah, thanks. You know, she, um...
She was sick for a little bit. So it was... You know, we were prepared for it.
-But thanks. -I know, yeah.
But, um, we've been... We were clearing out her house a little bit.
And I think I'm gonna fix it up and... maybe sell it.
-So... -Fix it up yourself? Yeah. That's kind of what I do.
Work on houses and stuff.
-Wow. -Yeah.
You build them? You do all the--?
I mostly do drywall stuff. Um...
-Huh. -My Uncle John runs a business. So I got caught up with him, like...
You know, we did work in New Orleans after Katrina and then...
-It's boring as shit, but anyway... -It's not boring.
I didn't know that that's what you were doing.
Yeah, it's, it's, um... It's good. So it's steady and it's consistent.
And, um... Yeah, it's cool. It's fun.
-What? I don't know. You seem... -What? I don't know.
Yeah. Yeah. No, it's good. It's like, um...
I ended up in Tucson and, um, it's great.
It's a really nice, warm climate and I dig it.
-Oh, it's too hot. -No, it's good.
It's better, you know... It's not like here. So, um...
That's what I've been doing. -Wow. -Yeah.
-Huh. Yeah, my parents moved to Florida. -Tucson. Warm. Good.
-To be warm. -Yeah.
-What? -They may move back.
-They may have to move back. -Yeah. What's going on?
My sister's having a baby.
Yeah, that's-- That's the... the grandparent pressure.
-Yeah. Yeah. -You know?
-You're not married, huh? -No. No, no, no. Married to the work.
-Married to the drywall. -To the work.
Which is how I like it, you know, it's good.
It's really good for me. I think that's how I-- Yeah.
It's good and, um...
[clicks tongue] It's right for me. You know?
Are you okay?
-Yeah. -You okay?
[whispers] I'm trying to get through this coffee. -[laughs] -This coffee is terrible.
-The Blue Jay has gone downhill. -Yeah.
-What? -Tell me about your husband.
-Really? -Yeah.
[Amanda] Oh, God, I don't even know where to start.
I got really lucky.
He's a really incredibly supportive, very nurturing, wonderful guy.
His name is Chris, and when I met him, he had two small boys.
And so...
Boom. Insta... Instamom.
And his ex-wife was... was really wonderful to me.
I don't know, their whole childhood... We had a week with them and a week off.
And so, you know, one week it's just the two of us.
We can do whatever we want, whenever we want to,
and footloose and fancy free, and... the next week,
it's Little League and soccer games, and then studying for the SAT's.
-And college tours, and, you know, so... -Yup.
-[chuckles] -[chuckles] What?
-It's crazy. Right? -It's crazy. Yeah.
It's just crazy. It's great. [sniffles]
-Jim... What? -[laughs]
It's crazy. It's just crazy.
-Would you stop it? -What? I'm not doing anything.
-You are doing something with your face. -I'm not.
I'm not doing anything.
My face leaks. I don't know. What? It's fine.
It's fine. It's fine.
-Good. -Anyway...
[clicks tongue] There's a pregnant woman -waiting for her ice cream. -Oh, yes. God.
-waiting for her ice cream. -Oh, yes. God. I'll walk you to your car.
-Yeah. Yeah, come on. -Okay.
-[Jim] Markum Dental, gone. -[Amanda] Oh, yeah?
[Jim] Yeah, I think you... You had nine, is the record?
-Oh, it might have been more like 11. -Yeah.
That's what happens when you live off of... -jellybeans. -[gasps] Jim.
-jellybeans. -[gasps] Jim.
[Amanda] There's no way.
[Jim] Oh, come on. No. No. That's not possible.
-[Amanda] I think it's him. -[Jim] No, that's his grandson.
He was like 100 in high school.
-[Amanda] That's his hat. -[Jim] Oh, my God.
-[Amanda] That's his hat. -[Jim] Oh, my God. -[Amanda] That's his hat. -Waynie. Travels with Waynie.
-[Amanda] That's his hat. -Waynie. Travels with Waynie.
-What? -Do you think he would remember?
I'm not sure he's alive. -[both laugh] -[Jim] I haven't seen him move yet.
-[Jim] No, he's not gonna remember. -Oh.
That was our dorky thing that we did. That was...
You wanna-- You wanna put a wager on it?
I'll bet you $100 he doesn't remember.
-A hundred dollars? -I'll bet you $100.
-[Jim] No, come on. No. -[door chimes ring]
-Hi, Waynie. -Hi, Waynie.
Hey. What's up?
-We were wanting to go traveling. -Oh.
Uh, you're talking...
Yeah. That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[Waynie] Okay.
-Thanks, Waynie. -Thank you, Waynie.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-I told you. -Come on. You planted that.
I did not. You owe me $100.
-I don't have $100. All right. -Well, you owe me $100.
-Mexico. -Yeah, hit me.
-Hit it. -What you got?
-Japan. -Okay.
-[Amanda] I've got Brooklyn. -[Jim] Germany.
Hey, Waynie, do you have any Zima?
[Waynie] I believe they pulled it off the market.
-[Amanda] Off the market. -Goldschlager?
-[Waynie] We don't carry that anymore. -[Jim] That's not good.
-Uh, Belgium. -[Amanda] Belgium.
[Jim] Jinx.
-Yeah? -Good.
[Waynie] I know who you are now. You're the lovebirds.
-The famous lovebirds -[chuckles]
And you're still together? Right?
-[both chuckle] -What? What? What's the matter? What?
Yeah. Yeah.
-[Waynie] What? -Yeah. It's, you know... It's 24 years.
-Yeah. -Still going strong.
Yeah, we got married, you know.
-[Waynie] Oh, congratulations. -Oh, thanks.
-[Waynie] Congratulations. -Thank you.
I'll get your jellybeans.
-[Amanda chuckles] -All right, what do we owe you?
You don't owe me anything. Your money's no good here.
-Come on. -Come on. Let an old man buy something, please.
Let an old man buy something, please.
-Make me happy, okay? [chuckles] -[Jim] Okay.
-Congratulations again. -Thanks, Waynie.
-Nice to see you. -[Waynie] Yeah. Good to see you, guys.
-You're looking good. -[door chimes ring]
-You look exactly the same. -[Waynie] Oh, get out of here!
-Come on, now. You're gonna make me cry. -[chuckles]
[Amanda] But I remember there being a...
-[Jim] Mm-mm. -[Amanda] Did they move them? [Jim] That's it. No, that's it. See? Because I used to put my leg...
[Jim] That's it. No, that's it. See? Because I used to put my leg...
-[Amanda] Yeah. -here. Watch.
-[Amanda] Okay. -There we go.
-[Amanda] Hold on. Let's see. -[exhales]
-[Jim] Come on. There it is. -[chuckles]
-[Amanda] Ha! I still got the stuff. -Uh-huh. Yeah.
So, what's next for you? You going back to Tucson or...
[Amanda] You working? -You got a house you're gonna build or... -Um...
I don't know if Tucson is, um...
[Jim] And, uh, I work stuff's kind of up in the air.
-What does that mean? -So...
-Um... -Do you not like doing it? No, it's good. It's, um...
[Jim] I don't know.
I have to admit, there's this small part of me, as I was sitting...
in the old house, and thinking about fixing it up,
and I was starting to think like...
I don't know, maybe... I could stay here. It was interesting to me.
-What would you do here though? -It was just a thought. I don't--
-I mean, it wasn't like a plan, but... -No, I know. No, I...
Don't you want...?
-Why are you grilling me? -I'm not trying to grill you. I'm...
I guess I'm a little worried about you.
-Why are you worried about me? -I don't know. You don't-- You seem...
I don't know, a little lost, or...
I haven't got it all... figured out. But, um... You know.
Isn't there something you want to do?
Amanda, I don't fucking know what I'm doing, okay?
I had lost my job, okay? I lost my job.
I had a falling out with my uncle who was stealing clients from me,
and I beat the fuck out of him, okay?
I beat the living shit out of him.
It was a really scary moment,
and I had a crack, and I feel awful about it and I'm...
I'm sorry, I didn't-- I... [sighs]
So I'm living in Tucson and I don't want to stay there anymore,
but I don't really know where else to go. [sighs]
And it's...
I'm having a...
[softly] I'm just having a hard time, so...
-I'm sorry. Yeah. -[raspberries] I'm not... [chuckles] I'm gonna start crying again.
[chuckles] I'm gonna start crying again.
-Yeah. -This is the thing with me, all right?
-I really think it's your fault, honestly. -Why is it my fault?
You used to give me the best head rubs.
And they used to really take the edge off.
Quit hogging the jellybeans. Give them up.
-Come on. -Give me some jellybeans. Okay?
That's why I'm so sad. -'Cause you won't give me any jellybeans. -[both laugh]
It's also a little hard 'cause you're really impressive.
Your life is really impressive.
-And so, there's a part of me that's... -Yeah.
Just saying.
I don't know. On the way here, I was getting on the plane,
and there was this family.
And this little boy, [chuckles] he was so mad and just... just irate.
he was so mad and just... just irate.
And, of course, he has no way of expressing any of that,
except to sort of just like scream and stomp his feet and...
He was screaming so loud, his tongue was curling to the back of his mouth,
and tears were just, like, you know, springing out of his face.
-He was leaking, you know. -[chuckles]
And I remember looking at him and being very jealous.
-Yeah. That's my soulmate. -[chuckles] Me and that four-year-old.
-That's my soulmate. -Yeah.
I don't know. At some point, we just learn it's better not to do that and...
I don't know at what point.
[Jim] Here.
-You ate a lot of them. -I did eat a lot.
You left me all the pink and purple ones.
[Jim] Yeah. They're your favorites.
What's up?
Lisa-Lisa wants to know where her ice cream is at.
-[chuckles] -Of course.
-Oh, God. -Does she like ice cream soup?
I'm just telling her I ran into someone.
-Oh... "Someone. Someone." -Don't take it per--
Sorry, yes. Fine, I'll tell her it's you. -Just-- -Mm-mm.
-No, she asked me who. It's Jim. -She's gonna ask-- There it is.
Lisa-Lisa, the interrogator. [sniffles]
"Holy fuckity-fuck, Jim-Jim?"
-She's Lisa-Lisa'ing you, man. -Yes, Jim-Jim.
[Amanda] Oh. Yes.
She wants to know how you look.
She wants to know when I'm coming back.
I kinda want to see your house.
You want to see the house?
It's been really great catching up with you.
But if the reason you're spending time with me is because
you feel sorry for me...
You don't have to do it. It's okay. Okay?
Sorry. There's boxes.
-Sorry. -It's okay.
There we go.
Yeah, I've still got a lot of stuff to pack up.
Yeah.
-That's a good one in particular. Yeah. -Yeah, I'll say.
-Yeah, pretty much how she left it, so... -Mm.
I've been thinking about drywalling where the paneling is.
Maybe taking out that wall, -so it opens into the kitchen. -Mm-hmm.
I don't know, there's also something kind of... cozy about it the way it is.
Thinking about it.
Uh, anyway, make yourself at home. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'll see you in a sec.
Oh, my God.
This is a very serious collection
-of romance novels. [chuckles] -Yeah.
This could not have been here... -when we were spending time... -There were some...
-when we were spending time... -There were some...
I think she really started collecting when I left...
-Yes. -...and I wasn't here to...
We would have had a field day with this.
-Yeah. Well... -[chuckles] I mean, let's face it. In your heyday, you were pretty...
-In my heyday? -You were pretty romantic.
I'm remembering when you read Wuthering Heights and made me read it.
I'm remembering when you read Wuthering Heights and made me read it. -And you sent me that... -[Amanda sighs]
I think it was four legal page letters that...
Jim, that's extreme. It wasn't... You called me Heathcliff. You called yourself Catherine.
You called me Heathcliff. You called yourself Catherine.
-"I am you, and you are me." -[shushes] Will you stop it?
-Yes, so... -That's completely humiliating.
By the way, don't pretend like you're all above this.
There is a very big difference, I would just like to point out, between this lovely array of books
I would just like to point out, between this lovely array of books
and the great work of art and literature that is Wuthering Heights.
I mean, they cannot be compared.
Oh, here's something for you. Right away.
Oh, here's something for you. Right away. "She knew that her heart and soul belonged to Justin."
-[both laugh] -What? What? Justin?
It's, like... [chuckles]
-There's no sexier name than Justin. -What? Justin.
"Oh, Justin. Do it to me, Justin."
-[Jim] Oh, come on. -Sorry.
No, there's more.
"But it wasn't until tonight that she realized
Justin also owned her body."
I'm sorry. There is no comparison between this and Wuthering Heights.
[Jim] First of all... [Amanda] It's sacrilegious to compare...
[Jim] I don't want to think about my mother reading these.
[Amanda] Neither do I, I have to say.
I've been staring at these, figuring out how to get rid of them.
-Why? You just... -Well, I don't know.
It's weird, like, I had this weird...
I had a strange mortality moment where I looked at them,
and I was like there's... 800 books here,
and even if I, for some reason, wanted to read all of these books,
I wouldn't be able to finish all these books before I died.
That's a weird... thing. You know, like the math of that.
-It's a pretty morbid thought. -I mean, just a...
Not to be morbid, but it's just a thing. You know?
Well...
I don't know, it's all relative, I think.
I mean, my husband, you know...
Maybe he would make it through this section,
if he were lucky.
-[Amanda] I don't know. -Yeah.
Can I, um... Do you mind if I go outside? I have to make a phone call.
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah.
-Thank you. -You know the way.
Yes, I do.
[Amanda] I know, I'm sorry, I meant to call you. Yeah. The minute I got there, she sent me right out to get some food for her.
she sent me right out to get some food for her.
Yeah, no, she seems really... She seems really good.
You know, she's just hungry. [chuckles]
Uh, I think we're just gonna stay in.
Just, you know, watch a movie or, you know, and eat. [chuckles]
Yeah.
Will you-- Can you just say that again? I didn't hear you.
Yeah.
This is amazing. This is amazing. It's like a time capsule.
-[laughs] -Yeah. It's all here.
-You need the black light. -A black light.
It was 1993. You needed a black light.
-Yeah, you had to have a black light. -You want to watch some, uh, Friends?
-Seinfeld? -Seinfeld?
The other option is I could do a little, uh... Gin Blossoms.
-Yes. Would you? -Or... Maybe Toad the Wet Sprocket? Oh. [gibbers]
-I hate the sound of Toad the Wet-- -Fine. Blues Traveler.
I like Blues Traveler.
-Oh, well, well, well, well, well. Mm-hmm. -[clicks]
You literally have every shirt you wore in high school still.
My mom kept stuff. That's just...
[Amanda sighs] God. Yeah. I remember wearing this one.
This one.
-I think this one is mine. -[both chuckle]
-I always hated this one. -I looked good in that.
You did not look good in it. You looked like a weird lumberjack.
-You say that like it's a bad thing? -It is a very bad thing.
-Well, you know, I'm sorry. -[gasps]
-That's private property. -Oh, really?
-Have some respect, okay? -For what?
-For your privacy? -Yes. Exactly.
-You probably read these to me out loud. -It's called privacy.
-No, no, that's private. -[chuckles] Oh, my--
"The winds of change are fucking blowing tonight."
-[Jim] No, no, no! You don't need... -No, no, no! No. [chuckles]
-No, thank you. Nope. Nope. -"Amanda, Amanda!
Who knew her name was going to be Amanda.
-What a face! -Hey!
-What a spirit! -Enough!
My lips said, 'Hello, my friend,' but my heart said, 'Hello, my future.'
I don't even know myself anymore.
-Jim has been ripped in half. -Burn it!
I'm so happy to bleed, for there is Amanda."
Oh, my God.
-[Jim] You want Japan or New York? -New York.
Oh, my God. [chuckles]
I found a picture of you that is outrageous.
You don't deserve this, by the way. Digging through my stuff.
Listen, man, you don't have a lock on your shit.
-[chuckles] -It's bound to get broken into.
Man, I can't believe you still have all this stuff.
-[Jim] Yup. -Crazy.
-[Jim] Mom was a bit of a hoarder. -Yeah.
-[chuckles] -Do you dare? Are you brave enough?
The winds of fucking change are blowing tonight, man.
The winds of fucking change are blowing tonight, man. -[Jim] Fuck you. Fuck you. -[laughs]
This first classic performance is entitled, "Hanging Out," made in 1994.
[laughs] Oh, my God.
-I don't know what's happening. Good luck. -[chuckles]
-[Amanda] What's it gonna be? -[clears throat] Oh, boy.

-Oh, come on! -No! No!
-You fucking taped over it. -This is what I was recording over.
We were running out of tapes. Wait. Hold on. -[shushes] -[Amanda on recorder] Welcome home.
[Jim on recorder] Thanks, sweetheart. It's so good to see you.
-[Amanda] How was work? -[both laughing] Ew. Ew.
[Jim] You know, Glen Donovan is canceling his account with us.
Twenty-three years doing business together. Just like that. Can you believe?
-Oh, business. -Twenty-three years with Glen Donovan.
I'm sorry.
[Amanda] I've got a little something to cheer you up.
-[Jim] Oh, come here then. Get over here. -[Amanda] Not that.
[Jim] You are in a late night Cinemax movie.
[Amanda] Close your eyes.
-[Jim] Why? -[Amanda] Just do it.
-See, I'm the boss, even then. Yeah. -[Jim] You're the boss.
-What are you doing? -[Amanda shushes] Would you be patient?
-[Jim] I'm not patient. -[Amanda] Jim, come on!
Okay, open them.
-[Jim] Oh, my God. -[Amanda] Happy 40th anniversary, lover.
[Jim] Oh, my God. Look at this meal. Look what you did.
-[Amanda] Do you like it? -[Jim] Oh. Sweetheart, it's beautiful.
[Jim] I'm so thankful. I didn't get you anything.
-I'm sorry. I forgot. -[Amanda] It's okay. You've been busy.
-Just sit down, let's eat. -[Jim] It's delicious. Oh, my God. Mmm.
Oh, my God. [Amanda] Is it good? I made your favorite.
-[Jim] You are my favorite. -[Amanda] I'd better be your favorite.
[Jim] So, did you talk to Jessica yet today? [Amanda] I did.
[Jim] And? [Amanda] And... she got it!
-[Jim] Yes! Yes! -[Amanda chuckles]
[Jim] Oh, I knew she would. But I mean, two years in,
she's already getting promoted.
-[Amanda] But are you surprised? -[Jim] No. That's our Jessica.
[Amanda] Ever since she was three years old, and she started telling me what to wear,
-I think we knew not to worry about her. -[Jim] I know.
Oh, now I know why poor Jason was a little...
-[Amanda] Yeah. -odd on the phone today.
[Amanda] I know. I think it's so hard when your big sister is so successful.
[Jim] Yeah, must be. But he's so wonderful in his own way.
-[Amanda] So wonderful. -[Jim] He's gonna find it. I know he will.
-[Amanda] And he's got your eyes. -[Jim] He's got your heart.
[Amanda] We've got a great couple of kids. [Jim] Well, they got a great mom.
Best mom in the whole world.
-[Amanda] Best dad in the whole world. -[Jim] Oh, come on!
It's kind of funny, like...
having the house to ourselves again, isn't it?
All those years with the four of us running around,
-bumping into each other and... -[chuckles] Just back down to the two of us.
[Amanda] Yeah.
-[Amanda] But it's nice. -[Jim] It is nice.
Hey, I'm really sorry...
-I forgot to get an anniversary present. -[Amanda] It's okay. [Jim] I feel really bad. I'm going to go to the bathroom real quick.
[Jim] I feel really bad. I'm going to go to the bathroom real quick.
Jim! What are you doing?
[Jim] Oh, just nothing. Here. Open it. Open it.
[chuckling] Stupid.
[Amanda] You got us tickets to see Annie Lennox? [Jim] Yes, I did. Happy anniversary. Do you like dancing?
[Jim] Yes, I did. Happy anniversary. Do you like dancing? [Amanda] You, son of a bitch! You tricked me!
[Jim] Hey, I still got a few tricks left up my old sleeve here.
Come here.
-[Jim] I love you, Amanda Henderson. -[Amanda] I love you more.
-[Jim] You were so good! -[both laugh on recorder]
[Amanda] How can I believe you?
-[Jim] The surprise of the tickets. -[Amanda] You seemed like an old man.
[Jim] I actually believed that you could really cook.
-[Amanda] Kiss me. -[Jim] Hey.
-[Jim] Here's to 80 more. -[Amanda] Yeah, 120 more.
-[Jim] Yeah, we could do that, right? -[Amanda] Yeah.
-We weren't very cool. [laughs] -No, we were deeply uncool.
-That was so... Oh... -That was really...
[Jim] Yeah.
I wonder where that plane is going.
-It's not coming here. -[both laugh]
He's like, "That town down there...
-"Sucks." -sucks."
Although, you know what, the fact that it's dark,
-you can't quite see the shithole-ness. -[chuckles] That is right.
-[Jim] And actually, right now... -It does look pretty.
-It's kind of nice, right? -Yeah.
Not so bad.
What's on your mind, eh?
Is it that obvious?
That was really...
a little unnerving...
back there, listening to all that stuff.
-I mean... I seemed quite, um, fun. -[both laugh]
-First of all. -Your rapping career didn't turn out...
the way you hoped it would, I think. I understand.
It's almost like I don't know who that person was on the tape.
I remember her really well.
-She was really fun, wasn't she? -Yeah, she was great.
-Yeah. -And I...
Don't get me wrong. It's not that my...
life isn't that. It's... I just...
-Amanda? -What?
I understand.
-You don't have to explain it to me. -[sighs]
Would you like to have some fun tonight?
Like just some...
stupid ass fun tonight?
Well, now I'm scared. What are you going to do?
-Do you trust me? -[laughs] I don't know.
-It's been a long time. I don't know. -It's a good question.
-Yeah, it has been a long time. -I really don't know. [laughs]
-Got to say fuck the ice cream, though. -Mm.
Fuck the ice cream!
Is that your new rap?
[both] Fuck the ice cream.
-Fuck. Fucka-fucka-fucka... -Fuck the... Fucka-fucka-fucka...
[both] Fuck the ice cream.
-[door opens] -[Jim] Honey, I'm home! Hi, sweetheart.
You have to close your eyes. Please just stay right up there.
Do not come down here, and close your eyes.
-[Jim] Why do I have to close my eyes? -Because...
-What's going on? -Because it's a surprise.
-Please, sweetheart. -Oh, a surprise. Okay.
-Did you have a good day, Mr. Henderson? -Well, there's a lot to talk about.
How was your day, Mrs. Henderson?
I have something very exciting to tell you as well. [Jim] Wow! That sounds like we should maybe have dinner
[Jim] Wow! That sounds like we should maybe have dinner and talk about our days.
-Do me a favor and please be patient. -Okay, I'm being patient.
-I'm closing my eyes. -Okay, keep them closed.
[Jim] You know I'll do anything for you, Mrs. Henderson.
I'm counting on it. Okay.
[Jim] Something smells delicious.
-Hello. -Hello, Mrs. Henderson.
Hello, Mr. Henderson.
-Keep your eyes closed. -Okay.
-Come with me. -Yes.
-Hold on to the railing, please. -Okay.
Okay.
It's very exciting.
-I can't wait to hear... -I love surprises.
-...all about your day at work. -Okay. Okay.
On the count of three, I want you to open your eyes.
Okay.
Okay, go for it.
-One, two... -Mm.
-Three. [chuckles] -Oh, my God!
[Jim] Look at this meal! It's gorgeous!
You made all this? You cooked all this?
Have you been taking cooking classes on the sly?
-Maybe, Mr. Henderson. -Oh, my gosh.
-Mrs. Henderson, this meal is beautiful. -[chuckles] It's elegant.
-Very French, Mr. Henderson. -But I have a question...
-What's the special occasion? -I can't believe you forgot.
-What? -Mr. Henderson...
Cinemax.
-Happy 20th anniversary, lover. -[both chuckle]
Of course I didn't forget. I was just playing.
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
-[chuckles] -I'm... I'm going here.
-Oh, let's eat. -Oh, let's eat.
-[Jim] These eggs are really something. -Really?
And the noodles, are they Asian?
-[chuckles] -[Jim] They're really fantastic.
Yes. That I slaved over for a very long time.
-Hard to make. -[Jim] No, I...
-Very, very hard to make. -You can really taste it in there.
-It tastes-- -How was your day, sweetheart?
Well... Glen Donovan was at it again, honey.
Oh, Glen Donovan, he's always giving you a hard time.
I don't know if I can take another day.
I mean, it's good stable income until your career takes off, of course, but...
Well, it's funny that you should mention that
because I got a very exciting phone call today.
You did? What was your phone call?
-I got a call today... -Mm-hmm.
saying I got the opening slot.
Opening... You got the opening slot?
I am going to open for...
-Oh, no. -Oh, yes. Oh, very seriously.
Are you going to be the first female white rapper to open for Public Enemy?
-Booyah! -[Jim] I knew it! -[laughs] -I knew you could do it, honey!
-Mrs. Henderson, they loved your demo. -They loved my demo.
-They thought it was so fresh. [laughs] -I'm so impressed. Come here.
-Cheers to you, Mrs. Henderson. -[clink]
-Thank you. -I can't believe it. Oh, no!
But you'll be on tour and I'll miss you. I'll be so sad.
-What do we do? -Well...
What do you think about saying, um... "Fuck you" to Glen Donovan?
I do it inside of my head every day, darling.
-I'd love to out loud. -[coughs]
-Tell me what you have. Tell me. -Honey...
-Okay, but you promise not to laugh? -I won't laugh.
I'd never laugh at you, honey.
I think it could be really, really romantic...
and also an opportunity to kind of like...
find ourselves and be adventurous. We rent an RV.
-Can I drive? -You can drive.
-Can we get matching hats? -We can get matching hats. [chuckles]
Laminated maps.
We can go from town to town, exploring things and sleeping outside under...
-Rapping by night. -the stars.
-Rapping by night. -Adventuring during the day.
-Yes. -We're going to go look for hot springs.
Hot springs and zip lining, and weird food and diarrhea...
We can go all over the country! We'll see all our people!
All our friends, and people that used to live here and moved away and...
Yes!
Jessica and Jason will come and visit us. It will be so magical.
Don't you think?
-[Jim] Honey? -What?
If you don't want to do it, we don't have to do it.
It's just, I think it could be really romantic.
Now, you listen to me, you son of a bitch.
This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to us.
-Honey. -What?
-I got egg in your beard. -Did you get some eggs all over my beard?
It's okay. It's okay. You know why?
-[laughs] Honey, that was really funny. -[chuckles]
But in all seriousness, hon... [chuckles]
-[laughs] -You are a brilliant planner.
-You're a wonderful cook. -[gasps] Sweetheart.
You're the greatest rap artist I've ever known.
It's the only true thing you just said.
And I think it's time for me to unveil my anniversary surprise.
You didn't.
-I did. -You didn't.
-[Amanda laughs] -I did.
[whispers] You didn't.
[softly] I did.
Watch the... Watch the one eyebrow raise. Watch this happen.
You're not doing it, honey. [laughs]
-There it is. Nailed it? -Not at all.
-There's two. -You have to do this. No, no.
-[laughs] Did I do it? -Well, now it's...
[both] Now, it's turning into something else.
I'm really sorry I got egg on you, honey.
It's a very sweet thing after all these years
you could still make me laugh like that.
-Twenty years. -Twenty years.
Let me give you your surprise. Jim... [whispers] did you really do something?
-I did. -[chuckles]
Jim.
Jim, Jim, Jim. [laughs]
[Amanda whispers] Jim. What are you doing?
-You leaving room for Jesus? [laughs] -You know it. Catholic school forever.
It's so good.
-[whispers] Hi. -Hi.
-Mrs. Henderson. -Hello, Mr. Henderson.
It's a very good present.
I'm okay.
-You crying? -I'm all right. I got this.
-It's like our prom all over again. -I know.
It's really a long song. I forgot how long this is. [laughs]
Surprised we had attention spans that would last long enough.
-I know. It is good. -But the song's so damn good.
Yeah, there it is.
-That was a very, very nice touch. -It was good. It was good.
What's next?
[Amanda] Oh, yeah.
-I'm scared. -Heads up. -[screams] -Oh!
Mm. Backwards!
-This is my Molly Ringwald. -I like that.
-[Amanda screams] -Oh, God.
-[Jim yelps] -Oh!
[Amanda] Shit, yeah.
[Jim] Jump, jump, jump!
[Amanda] Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.
-Enough with the moaning. -God, I forgot how good it feels.
-Enough with it. Take it easy. -[moans] Oh, my God.
You know, I was kidding when I was on the rocks. But, seriously...
I don't want to punch anybody. As long as you rub my head, I'm good.
No, that means it's ending. Don't do that. Don't do that.
-[Jim] I don't want it to be over. No! -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-That's enough for you. I think it is. -No, it's not.
-Keep going. -No, I'm not gonna keep going, Jim.
I have done this for you like a million times.
You've never done it for me once. Not once.
-All right. Stretch it out. -Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding? Could we please get on with the rub?
I've waited a very long time for this.
You can't rush greatness, okay? Take it easy. All right?
If you want to experience the ancient art of phrenology,
you really need to wait and get it done right.
-Come again? -Okay, well, if you had seen Men at Work,
the classic Charlie Sheen, Emilio Estevez film from 1990,
you would know, it's when you...
you know, feel and interpret someone's skull features,
and see what's going on in there.
See, I get up in here and I say...
See that knot right there? That says you're a terrible cook.
-Okay? You're shitty. -[chuckles] Shut up.
This... Um...
And I'm getting this straight from the skull features,
you are a lover of animals.
Yeah, you knew that already because I told you that I run a dog rescue.
Tell me about your doggies.
I haven't really heard you talk about it much.
-It was Chris's idea actually. -What's that?
That I open the rescue.
-Yeah. -That's cool.
-Yeah. -I love the idea of you
kind of hanging out with little Freddy-like greyhounds
and taking care of them. I miss Freddy.
We don't really... We don't do the greyhound thing.
What do you mean? You were like the greyhound queen.
[Amanda] Yeah, they're just, you know, they're not practical.
Chris pointed out and he's right that, you know...
They have a lot of special needs. They take a lot of work.
We have a small organization, and, you know, it's manageable.
I guess I just...
You love greyhounds. I don't... I mean...
Yes, I do.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
I always think of them as people wearing a fur coat.
I don't know. I just always have felt understood by them.
That makes sense.
I don't know. They want to be around people, but...
I don't know, feel what they feel. I can't explain it. It's...
I can tell that they know that being out in the world is hard.
Yeah.
And they feel it and they just want to be, like, nuzzled up in...
They want to make you feel better.
They have that instinct of wanting to be close.
And I don't know. I just...
And you can take a greyhound, even with all of the things
that come with owning them or caring for them,
or rehabilitating them.
You take the oldest, neediest, most anxious,
broken down greyhound, and if you take that dog to the beach,
and you take off his collar,
he will just fucking run.
-Like he was still young. -Yeah.
Just tear down that beach.
And there's like sand flying and tongue is hanging out his mouth,
and he's just so...
I don't know, it's so beautiful.
I think you should think about working with greyhounds.
Yeah.
-[Jim] A decent amount of stars tonight. -[Amanda] Hmm.
-Can I tell you something? -[Jim] Anything.
I've...
I've been taking anti-depressants...
for awhile. [chuckles]
And...
I haven't told anyone, you know. Not even Chris.
And I don't know why...
I feel so embarrassed
about taking them.
It's probably because there's nothing, you know,
there's nothing wrong with my life.
I should be happy.
But there's this...
sadness.
And I don't know where it comes from.
I can understand that.
The drugs, they're... [chuckles] they're weird.
-I mean, I've... -[Jim] Yeah.
I literally haven't cried in five years.
Yeah, I don't have that particular problem myself. [laughs]
-Can I ask you something? -Anything.
Why don't you talk to Chris about it?
I...
I don't know.
I think there was a time when I would have.
But things...
Things are just kind of changing. They're just... changing now.
How so?
Bryce is off to college and Theo is right behind him and...
Chris is... Chris is almost 64 now.
What?
[stammers] I mean, I knew he was older. I didn't realize he was that much older.
-Yeah, well, you know... -It's...
-It's not nothing. -Yeah.
-I... -But...
I have loved...
I have loved being a mom to those kids, you know?
I just, I...
I do not know what it's going to be like when they're gone.
And sometimes I look at Chris, and I think...
"Oh, my God.
Am I going to be taking care -of an elderly person soon?" -[chuckles]
I knew it. You know, I knew it going in, but somehow...
being faced with just the two of us, alone in a house and...
-I don't know. -It's real now.
-Yeah. -Yeah. I get it.
-Hey. -Hey, what?
I want to say thank you.
Why do you--? What for?
For tonight.
For remembering my pink and purple jellybeans.
You know.
For never making me feel wrong about who I am.
What?
-I just... -You're embarrassed on my behalf?
-[laughs] -No, no, I just had a thought and it's...
-What? You have to tell me. -Nothing. No, it was...
I just told you something that I've never told anyone,
-and I think that you should just... -[sighs] I was thinking about...
our first time... in the back of this truck at the lake.
-All 38 seconds of it? [laughs] -Oh, shut up.
I was excited. I was 16, okay?
I've developed some serious skills since then.
-I'll have you know. -Oh, yeah.
In fact, I've been servicing the entire Tucson, Arizona area with...
-What are you, a plumber? -[laughs]
It's funny though, 'cause...
It's never really been like it was with us, for me.
I mean, you know, that's a nostalgia thing.
-You know, that's how it's... Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah.
It's the same for me.
-Really? -Yeah.
-There's something about those dumb kids. -[laughs]
-Yeah. -They knew something.
Yeah.
-Magic. -Magic, that's right.
-Jim? -Yeah.
Will you kiss me?
I know what I'm asking.
I love you.
I have to go, Jim.
-Jim, please. -Amanda...
-Hey, listen. I don't want you to go! -Please, please!
-Will you just please give me a minute. -Okay, okay, okay. Listen.
It's confusing, I get it. Okay? I just want... We can talk about it.
I don't want to talk about it! I don't want to talk about it.
I shouldn't have let this game go on for so long.
-This is not a game to me, though. -Do you understand that I am married?
-I understand. -You know what that means?
-I belong to someone else! -I understand. I'm just trying--
Will you please just give me a little bit of room.
[Amanda] Where the fuck is my coat?
Where did you get this?
It was in your closet.
And you just took it?
Yeah.
-Why? -It's addressed to me, first of all.
And second of all, I wanted to read it.
Well, if this is just a game to you, Amanda,
then why do you need to read a letter that I wrote to you 22 years ago?
What is this--? What could this possibly mean to you?
You know, I don't know. I just wanted to read it.
Well, this is my letter.
-I know that and I'm sorry. -No! I don't think you understand that.
I think you need to understand something, that this is my letter.
Okay? This belongs to me.
And you can't come into my house, and just take this,
and do whatever you want with it without asking me, because it's mine too.
You understand me?
-What is this--? -That was my baby, too. Okay?
It was ours!
-What--? -It was ours.
You just fucking...
Why did you...?
Fucking...
-Why did you do that? -Jim.
Why did you do that?
-[stammers] You... -I was a scared kid!
I didn't know how to handle it!
You had to give me a minute! You fucking went away and you...
You were the one who told me that we were too young--
I was scared! Why'd you fucking do it?
-Oh God... -It was our life!
[Jim breathing heavily] Fuck!
[sobs] We were gonna be so happy.
We lost it. We lost everything.
Jim.
Fuck.
-[Amanda] Breathe. Breathe. -[exhales]
Okay. Okay.
Take a deep breath, please.
-[Jim, softly] I'm sorry. -I'm sorry too.
-I'm really sorry. -I'm really sorry, too.
[Amanda] Okay.
I need you to understand something.
I didn't just irrationally make the decision to do what I did.
And I know, I see now that it was incredibly hard on you.
But I was the one who had to go in there and actually do it.
Actually go through with it, you know?
[stammers] And I do get that I didn't handle it well. I didn't...
I just... I tortured myself
going over the options alone, in my bedroom.
Going over and over what I should do.
And then you sent me that stupid note.
Making all those... those weird, sarcastic jokes and...
And then you sent me that stupid "Get Well Soon" balloon.
A balloon, Jim.
I don't know, there was just something about it
where it became so clear to me that, that you were too young to handle it.
We were too young to handle it.
And I knew that I was gonna have to go through it alone
and I knew I couldn't... do it alone.
And, you know...
Do I have regrets? Yes. Yes.
But, I...
What can we do?
Here.
[Jim] Please.
Will you just read it?
"Amanda,
I know we can get through this together.
You are my world.
I will never stop loving you."
[sobs] It was the first version that I wrote to you.
[sobs] Why didn't you send this to me?
I was scared. I didn't...
I was just stupid. I'm sorry.
-[woman] Sorry for the wait. -Hey, don't even worry about it.
Let's discuss this loan application.
Well, Cathy... [chuckles]
-Can I call you Cathy? -Uh, sure.
-Great. Where are you from, Cathy? -Van Nuys.
Oh, no. I meant your heritage. Where are your people from?
-Oh, Greek. -Oh.
Yeah, but my family is fifth generation American.
Great. Well, then you'll totally understand where I'm coming from.
Cathy, my name is Ray Moody.
I was born and raised in Glendale, California,
and I am an entrepreneur.
I believe in the spirit of innovation.
This country was built on ideas that are progressive and one-of-a-kind.
-Wouldn't you agree? -I suppose.
Yeah. Great, Cathy.
Well, I'll tell you, Cathy,
I can't wait for you to hear what I have in store for us.
Cathy, I run a business based on one idea:
helping people.
Isn't helping people the cornerstone of any worthwhile endeavor?
Isn't that what makes America great?
Isn't it?
Through years of research and practice,
I've developed a system of nuance, psychotherapeutic techniques
guaranteed to give clients just the helping hand they need.
[man] What the-- What are you doing?
What the heck is happening? Oh, my God! Help me!
Hi, Stuart.
Give it to me straight.
What'd you have for lunch today?
-A garden salad. -Don't lie.
-You went to Baxby's again, didn't you? -No, sir. No.
You'd rather have a jumbo bacon double cheeseburger
from Baxby's any day of the week.
Isn't that right, Stu? Isn't that why you're so goddamn fat?
No. No, sir. I had a garden salad.
Garden salad?
Stu... I found the receipt in your coat pocket.
You had curly fries, too.
Don't look so down.
As a matter of fact, I stopped at Baxby's drive thru on our way over here.
There's only one problem.
I bought a few too many of these bad boys by mistake.
-You think you can help me out, Stu? -No, I'm not hungry. No. I'm not.
-Yeah, you are. Open up. -No, no!
-Only 12 more to go. -No, I can't.
I can't. I can't--
-Has it been eight hours? -To the minute.
Congrats, Stuart. I doubt you'll be visiting Baxby's again anytime soon.
Yeah, I don't think so.
This got a little shit on it in the scuffle. I'm sorry.
If you need a good dry cleaners, I know a guy.
No, no. Thank you, though. I have to tell you, you, uh... [chuckles]
You really scared me back there at the bar.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Thanks. I appreciate that.
Okay. What is the name again?
You can make it out to Kidnap Solutions LLC.
People pay you to kidnap them?
For the simulated experience of a high-stakes abduction, yes.
I'm not sure I understand.
Well, you might think of it as a kind of alternative therapy.
My clients use the service for any number of curative reasons.
Curative?
Yeah. I mean, sure, some people do it just for kicks,
but we have any number of people combating addictions--
drugs, alcohol, fatty foods.
To that end, we deploy a number of association tactics
descended from Pavlov.
-He's the Russian-- -Are you a licensed psychologist?
No. How is that relevant?
Eighteen months ago, your company was based out of Atlantic City.
That's correct.
And what prompted you to relocate?
The economy. My business model was based on tourism.
Well, did the lawsuit... have anything to do with your relocation?
Absolutely not.
Well, in the interest of full disclosure--
-Give me a break. -Pardon me?
I'm sorry, but before every encounter,
I consult with my clients to set very specific boundaries
about what's going to work and what isn't.
I leave a paper trail, I fax documents--
No, but you... You didn't in Atlantic City.
No.
No. You know what? [taps desk] No, thanks.
This is an ambush, lady.
And based on this bank's reputation,
I expected a level of professionalism today.
And those expectations were not met.
Have an awesome day, Cathy.
I'm sorry, do you guys validate parking?
Hey, it's your sister. Where are you?
The party started an hour ago and I told the kids you were coming
and it would be very uncool if you didn't show up.
And can you... Can you please not wear the wig?
Just leave it at home.
I just... I don't want to have to explain it to people.
It's fucking creepy.
Thank you. See you soon. Bye.
-Thanks a lot, Tom. -Yeah, you bet.
I really appreciate it. I'll pay you back as soon as I can. You have my word.
-Don't worry about it. Happy to do it. -I was gonna tell you,
I've been talking with some big money guys back east.
They really believe in the concept.
Talking about franchise potential, so I really feel...
Kids are getting big.
They do that when you don't see 'em for a while.
Thanks for having me over.
Glad you could make it this time.
[man on TV] Where did you conceal the rest of the money, Mr. Jules?
They're in the bank vault, far beyond your reach.
Perhaps you underestimate my ability in obtaining the things that I want.
You'll be very wise if you don't cry out, mademoiselle.
Even a criminal dislikes to use violence with anybody so lovely.
You tempt me, mademoiselle, to steal something more.
[man] Calling all thrill-seekers and adrenaline junkies.
Design your wildest kidnap fantasy today.
Phone us for a free consultation. That's 1-800--
Hello?
-[woman] Is this Ray? -Speaking.
Is this a bad time?
No, no. Not at all.
I'm calling about my free consultation.
Sure. What did you have in mind, uh...
-Anna. -Anna.
I have a fantasy.
I want to disappear.
-Okay. That can be arranged. -Really?
I'm so glad.
Yeah, we have a whole...
A host of different scenarios that we can, uh... recommend.
Surprise me.
Okay.
Your website lists a standard rate for an eight-hour simulation.
Is that negotiable?
-Oh, well-- -Sorry, let me be more clear.
I'd like to go for the whole weekend.
I'm prepared to pay extra for the longer simulation.
You are?
How's 5,000 even?
-Half upfront... - [clattering] the other half after we've finished.
-Ray? -Yes, I'm still here. That's, uh... that's fine.
I was going to mention there's one more thing that I'd like to request.
-Okay. -I'm kind of embarrassed to ask.
Oh, no, I've been doing this a long time.
Trust me. There's no request I haven't heard.
Slapping.
What's that?
During the simulation, I'd like for you to... slap me.
-You've been on our site? -Yes.
It's just that, uh... We have those terms up there.
I'm sure you read we're not allowed to hit our clients.
Anna?
I was hoping that you would make an exception.
I'm afraid that's just not possible at this time.
I see.
-But listen if you want to... -Fuck.
What's wrong?
Nothing. Thanks for your time. -[hangs up] -No! No, no.
-St. Blair. -Anna?
Yes. Please don't call me anymore.
No, no. Hold on. Hold on.
Is this legit?
What is?
You weren't yanking my chain about the 5,000?
You can look me up.
I'm an account executive
at Carnahan Cutler Monroe, West Coast Division.
-I should go. -Wait, wait, wait.
Ray, is our conversation finished or isn't it?
No.
Then you'll keep an open mind?
-I will. -I'm so glad.
[Anna] You sound surprised.
Well, it's a lot of money.
Yes, but you understand it comes with strings attached.
No, of course.
I don't scare easily. It has to feel real.
That's what we're all about.
[Ray] Case file 402. Subject: Anna St. Blair.
Position: senior business consultant,
Carnahan Cutler Monroe, Los Angeles branch.
Subject has requested a surprise scenario.
I've dusted off one of my classic simulations.
The Schwentke file.
You're gonna get us that file, Miss St. Blair, one way or another.
It's a tale of corporate espionage where I play the brute enforcer,
she's the damsel in distress.
And Schwentke, well,
that's for me to know and her to find out.
All the pieces are in place.
She won't know when it's coming.
Or where.
Or how.
You have one new message.
[Anna] I saw you in the elevator this afternoon.
You didn't say anything.
Were you outside my house, too?
You really should be more careful next time, Ray.
-[shrieks] -Stop.
Eyes on the road, Anna. Stay cool.
-How do you know my name? -Light's green.
Are you... are you wearing a wig?
You have a green light. Let's go, let's go.
-Would you like my car? -No.
Okay. No.
What do you want? I'm sure we can work something out.
Just keep your hands at ten and two, just like in Driver's Ed.
-What's in there? -Shut up.
-What's in your hand-- -Shut up.
Okay. Hold still.
I don't think I can drive with these things on my...
Sure you can.
You know, I'm supposed to be speaking at a very important conference tonight
and if I'm not there, people are gonna ask...
People are gonna ask questions about where I am.
Shut up and drive.
Okay. Hold tight a sec. I'll be right back.
[muffled] Help me!
Help!
-Help! -[knocking]
-Are you through? -[screams weakly]
There's nobody around. Nobody can hear you.
-[whimpers] -I'm gonna cut you free. Don't make any sudden movements, okay?
All right, let's go. Come on.
Hop in.
Oh, no, no. I can't go in there. I'm a claustrophobe.
-Seriously? -No, yeah, I'll go into shock, so...
Turn around.
-Turn around. -Listen, this isn't some ploy.
I've done absolutely everything that you've asked me to do up until right now.
-Get in. -Okay, okay, okay.
-Watch your head. -Okay, okay.
Get your fucking leg down. I will fucking slam this on you.
I'm not kidding. I am not fucking around.
-Oh, shit! -[screams]
-Why are you doing this? -Shut up.
[scoffs] You're Anna St. Blair?
-That was a question. -You told me to shut up!
Okay. Are you Anna St. Blair or aren't you?
Yes.
-You are Anna St. Blair? -Yes.
You work at Carnahan Cutler Monroe, the L.A. branch?
What is this about?
My employer has taken an interest in a certain client of yours,
a man by the name of Schwentke.
Schwentke?
Are you sure you're pronouncing that correctly?
Listen, Anna,
this can either go very smoothly for you or very difficultly.
What?
-The Schwentke file, where is it? -Who is Schwentke?
[groans] Okay.
CCM doesn't represent anybody by that name.
If I could help you with this, don't you think I would have already?
Don't fuck with me, Anna!
You're gonna get us that file, Miss St. Blair, one way or another.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You can't just keep me here like this.
People are gonna be looking for me.
Which?
Oh, come on. No.
Lady, I don't ask twice.
That one.
Well, I hope you're more cooperative tomorrow, for your own sake.
Hey, Tom, it's Ray. I left a package at your place last night.
Make sure you get to it before Natalie does.
My name's not on it or anything but it's in your mail.
You know, for the first time in a long time,
I really feel like I'm heading down the right path, like...
I don't know, everything's the way it should be.
All right. Later, man.
You hungry?
-I'm starving. -Well, you're in luck, then.
I got a whole mess of chicken fingers in here. Two orders' worth.
Ketchup?
Smells pretty good, doesn't it?
Okay, here it comes.
Before we dig into our breakfast here,
I'm gonna need some answers.
I already told you.
CCM doesn't have any clients named Schwentke.
Where's the file?
-[sobs] I don't know. -Where's the fucking file, Anna?
Please don't yell at me.
One way or another, I'm gonna get what I need.
These are very powerful people we're talking about here.
This shit goes higher up the totem pole than you could ever imagine.
You won't leave here alive unless I have that file in my hands!
There must be some mistake. There must be some sort of misinformation.
I mean, you're very good at your job, but...
I have a family.
And, um...
I have a dog.
He's a rescue dog. He's such a good...
He's such a good dog.
I have plants.
I have plants, too.
But I'm not who you think I am...
and I don't have what it is you need from me.
So please...
Please.
Please let me go home.
I have to go make a call.
She's good. She's good. She's good.
She's a fucking pro, I'll give her that.
But you got this.
You got this.
You got this.
Nice.
Listen, I know you're scared, but I'm just the middleman here.
I don't want anyone to have to suffer, so I'm gonna be straight with you.
In my line of work, I've seen lots of things.
Terrible things.
These guys do not fuck around.
But I know that if you can just work with me here,
give me the materials that I need
so that I can be able to say that I did my job,
we'll both make it out of this unscathed.
You have my word.
What?
[snorts] I'm sorry.
Are you kidding me with this shit?
You hold me at gunpoint and you tie me up in your...
You tie me up in your basement,
and then you invent some bullshit excuse to try to connect.
Well, it's not bullshit.
And expect me to treat you like you're...
Like you are my knight in shining armor.
You don't even know what you're talking about, okay?
You're treading very dangerous waters here.
Oh, I remember you. You were that guy in the elevator.
You were the guy that was staring at my ass.
You don't--
My employers...
You don't even--
You're in some very serious shit here, Anna.
You have seriously underestimated the amount of shit you're in.
You're gonna get me that fucking file, Anna!
Stop yelling in my face, you fucking pervert!
Oh, you spineless pussy. You can't even--
How was that?
You hit like a girl.
You and I are gonna talk Schwentke,
who I know is your fucking client, and I don't care how long it takes.
You're gonna give me exactly what I need.
And I don't care if your fucking plants fucking shrivel up and die!
They could die for all I care!
And don't think that I don't know that you don't have a rescue dog.
Yeah, that's right, Anna.
I've been to your house, and contrary to what you might think
I happen to be exceptionally good at my job.
So you just better make goddamn sure
that that job doesn't involve me cutting you into little fucking pieces
and feeding you to that fake ass fucking dog!
You can have the file!
-What did you say? -I'm hungry. I'm tired.
These cords are cutting off my circulation.
And, you know, I probably need to pee again.
If you want Schwentke that bad you can have him.
I'm really tired of this shit.
Really?
Yes.
You really know him?
Schwentke?
Yeah, yeah. He pays me 500 bucks an hour.
Come on, let's go.
-Where? -My office.
No, no, that's not gonna work.
Well, I can call my assistant and have her fax it over.
No, no. No calls, no faxes.
Okay, so what do you suggest? Telekinesis, maybe?
Is there some kind of online corporate database that...?
-No. What? -I don't know. What the heck--
Just let me call my assistant.
There better not be any funny business. Mm-mm.
Okay, I have to get the okay from my employers. I'll be right back.
Okay.
Shit.
Hey, buddy, it's Tom. Glad to hear you're in high spirits again.
I'm actually holed up in Vegas all week in a conference,
-so I wasn't able to get your package. -[creaking]
But don't worry about that.
I'm sure Natalie has it waiting for me when I get home.
You scared the shit out of me. You can't just barge in here like that.
What the hell is this?
I don't know. What is it?
It's an unmarked envelope full of cash that I found in my mailbox this morning.
How do you know that I put it there?
Are you borrowing money from Tom again?
Is that why you came to the birthday party?
No.
Did you sell the furniture?
-This place looks like shit. -[thudding below, screams]
Natalie, now's not a great time.
-What are you doing? -Nothing.
Do you have a friend here?
Oh, God. You have one of them here.
You have one of them here! At Mom's house?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Don't go down there!
Oh, well, this is just great.
[screams] Help me!
I hope you're having a pleasant experience.
I'm gonna go.
Ray, are you fucking kidding me?
I can't believe you. We grew up in this house!
Will you lower your voice?
-Who is she? -A new client. A good one.
And she's paying big money for an authentic simulated experience,
which you just compromised by engaging with her.
What?
You just introduced yourself into the equation.
Now I have to come up with a whole backstory for you.
Maybe...
Maybe you're my employer.
Wait, did I specify a gender? Fuck!
Can you hear yourself right now? You sound like a lunatic.
It's my job. I'm good at it.
Think about what Mom would say if she could see you right now.
Can you just stop for a second and think about what she'd say?
I gotta go. My kids are waiting in the car.
Well, you can bring 'em inside. I'd like to say hi to them.
And then should we bring 'em downstairs
and introduce them to the nice lady in the basement?
Well, you can't just leave 'em out in the car. That's irresponsible.
I'm irresponsible?
You need to grow the fuck up, and get a real job.
You know, the next time I bring my kids to see you,
I would prefer you not be behind eight inches of glass.
And water your fucking plant! That looks terrible!
[man on TV] Authorities are still searching today for a Hollywood Hills woman
feared missing since early yesterday evening.
Colleagues say they grew concerned after she failed to appear
at a corporate gala where she was due to deliver the keynote speech.
No.
She was last seen leaving her office in a black S550 Mercedes.
For any tips, you can call... -[clattering below]
Anna, we need to talk.
There's been some kind of misunderstanding. The police think--
-[grunts] -Oh, shit! Did you just stab me?
What's wrong with you?
Whoa. Okay, I'm calling this off.
This is getting too real. You can keep your 5,000, whatever.
Oh, motherfuck.
[screams] Help! Someone--!
Are you insane? The police are outside.
We're not in pretend land anymore.
-Shh. Look at me. Look at me. -Help me!
Yeah, just a second!
I'll be right there!
-Are you Raymond Moody? -Yeah, speaking.
What took you so long to get to the door today, Raymond?
Uh, you caught me in the can. [chuckles]
How can I help you guys?
We're here about a lady who went missing last night.
Missing?
Are you familiar with a woman named Anna St. Blair?
No. No, I don't think so.
You drive a white van?
Used to be white. It's more like rust colored now, actually.
-It has Jersey plates? -Yeah, actually it does.
-Is the car in your garage? -No, it's in the shop.
I gotta say, I'm getting a little confused here.
It was a neighbor that saw your car
parked in front of her house last three nights running.
-I'm sorry, whose neighbor? -Miss St. Blair.
-She's the one that's missing? -Yeah.
-Miss St. Blair. -Not the neighbor.
Right. Isn't it a little early to open a missing persons investigation?
I watch a lot of cop shows. [laughs]
Like I said, it's in the shop and it's been in the shop all week.
You know the name of the shop?
I don't know the name of it but it's on Manchester, near the airport.
A guy I know is a mechanic there.
What's your friend's name?
-Hayward. -Hayward have a first name?
Just Hayward is all I know.
You don't think he could have something to do with this, do you?
You know, he did say...
Yeah, he mentioned that he was on parole. Oh, man, Hayward.
You don't happen to have his number handy, do you?
No, I'm afraid not. I just kinda drop it off when it needs fixing.
But he's usually there if you zip by.
So should I just give you a call if I hear from Hayward?
Yeah. If we need to get a hold of you this week.
Yeah, we know where you live.
Right.
Mr. Moody...
have a good weekend.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
All right.
I'm just gonna need the truth from you here.
Please tell me that that shit you pulled back there was all part of the act.
That you're still acting.
If that's the case, and I know that's the case,
then we can just end this thing right here and go our separate ways.
You know what this is, right? You called me on the phone, you...
You asked for this. You paid for this.
You didn't?
You have no idea what I'm talking about. You're--
Hold on.
Please let me go. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what it is...
I think that you have the wrong person.
You didn't call me on the phone?
You didn't deposit $2,500 into my bank account?
I lied.
I lied about Schwentke because I thought
if I told you... [sobs] what you wanted to hear,
you might let me go.
Please let me go home.
There is no Schwentke. I made him up.
-You made up Schwentke? -It's all part of the scenario.
I run a company that specializes in simulated abductions.
-What? -Designer kidnappings.
Call it like a heightened form of immersive theater, you know.
Oh, my God.
-You're insane. -No, no.
Look, a woman named Anna St. Blair called me a few days ago
and contracted me to kidnap her.
Up until now, I had every reason to believe you were that woman.
Why would...?
Why would I do...?
Why would anyone do this? Why would I hire you to do this to me?
These psychos pay you money to torture them?
No. They use our services for any number of reasons.
-Our? -My--My services.
I don't get it.
Don't they have loved ones, people that miss them while they're gone?
Typically a session only lasts eight hours,
not enough time to arouse suspicion.
Yours was a special case.
Let me guess, Ray.
You got carried away?
You paid for the weekend.
Ray, I've never seen that before.
You signed it.
No, no, no. That's not--
That can't be right. That's not--
You paid me half up front.
That says anonymous deposit.
Well, most of them are.
That does not come as a surprise to me.
Wait a minute.
[Anna] I saw you in the elevator this afternoon. You didn't say anything.
Were you outside my house, too?
You really should be more careful next time, Ray.
That's not my voice. I don't know who that is.
-That sounds a lot like you. -That's not me.
There must be someone else with my name.
No, no. That's too big a coincidence.
I mean, I saw you in the elevator that day. You brought it up earlier.
Were you outside my house?
Yes.
How long were you watching me?
A couple of days.
Call the number back.
-[tone sounds] -[message] We're sorry. The number you have reached is not in service. Please check--
Disconnected.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but there's only one logical explanation.
I mean, isn't it obvious? We were set up.
Who would do that? Who? Why?
Who would waste all of their time putting together such...
Such an elaborate plan?
Don't you have any enemies?
I mean, somebody that might benefit from you being sidelined for a few days?
You know, missing your big speech?
Me? I don't have any-- What about-- What about you?
I don't have any enemies.
You work with crazy people for a living.
I mean, you must have your fair share of disgruntled clients.
Disgruntled? Never. I'm very good at what I do.
No.
You're really not very good at what you do.
Do you know her?
-No, I don't think so. Who is she? -Have you ever been to Atlantic City?
Once I was there when, I think, I was a kid.
Who is she?
Nobody. I'm sure it's nothing.
-Where's my car? -It's in the garage.
-And my phone? -In the glove box.
-Perfect. -What are you gonna tell the police?
The truth. That you kidnapped me, that you hit me.
-I was just doing what I was told. -Fuck you.
Companies like this should not exist. It's dangerous.
-People can get hurt. -They'll send me to jail.
Ray, maybe you should've thought about that
before you kidnapped me in the first place.
Garage?
The keys aren't in the--
Ray.
I want you to think very carefully...
about your next move.
Okay?
Every second you hold onto those keys,
you're digging yourself in an even deeper hole.
I can't let you leave.
-Just hear me out. -[yells]
Okay, please, if you could just listen to me for one second--
-Stay back! -Ow! God.
-Stay back. -Okay, okay, I'm staying right here.
Right here. Right here.
-I'm leaving, Ray. Give me the keys. -Okay, okay, cool it.
Don't you tell me to fucking cool it, asshole. Give me the keys.
It's not a real gun.
-What? -That's not a real gun.
It's just a pellet gun.
-Oh, shit! -Give me the keys!
-Oh, fuck! -Give me the keys!
-[fires] -Oh, shit! Goddamn it!
Give me the keys, Ray!
I really wish you could see this from my point of view.
Give me the keys!
Okay. I'm really sorry about this.
What are you doing?
Are you fucking crazy? Spit it out!
You can't leave...
until we've sorted this out.
Spit it out, Ray.
I swallowed it. [gurgles]
I... [groans]
I just want us to talk about what happened
and come to a mutually beneficial conclusion.
Spit the keys out.
-I swallowed it. -Spit the keys!
-I swallowed it. -Spit them out!
I can feel it right here. God! I didn't want to do that.
Spit out the key!
I'll try.
Oh, gross!
-It's down there. -Ew!
-It's down there now. -Spit out my key! -[gags] -[phone rings]
-[message] Ahoy! -Help me!
Please help me! I've been kidnapped!
-You've just won... -[screams]
[Ray] Anna?
Anna?
Here. For your head.
Oh, this is a fucking nightmare.
Ah! Hey, cut it out. You want me to crash?
Stop it.
You can't do this. The police are looking for my car.
You know that, right?
I swapped out the plates. I had some fakes in storage.
-Where are you taking me? -We couldn't stay at my house anymore.
It was only a matter of time before the police swung back around.
-So I'm officially your hostage. -You're not my hostage.
Do you know that you're committing a felony right now, you asshole?
You know what, Anna? You know something?
You know what? Never mind. Forget about it.
It's not important.
-It's just... -Oh, brother...
Have you stopped to consider the amount of abuse that I've taken from you today?
Oh, you've gotta be fucking kidding me, right?
I am the victim here.
I am the victim in this scenario.
I am the victim here, not you!
-You're right. I apologize. -Oh, Jesus Christ. Don't apologize.
Fuck. Please just let me go.
I can't risk you going to the cops right now, okay?
Look, I know that there's a solution to this somewhere
and if you and I can just put our heads together and figure it out,
everything's gonna be okay, all right?
Okay.
[in trunk] You motherfucker! Let me out of here!
Fuck you! Fuck you, you motherfucker!
Fuck you! Let me out of here! Fuck!
You cool? Come on.
Just give me your hand. Just come over here.
Stop it. You're being silly now. Come on.
I honestly think you're gonna dig this place.
It's a family cabin. My dad built it in the 70s and my sis--
Anna!
Anna? Come on.
This doesn't have to be such a chore. Let's go.
What are you hiding from me for?
[Anna] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
[Ray] Believe me when I tell you that I never meant for it to come to this.
I know. I know you're not exactly my biggest fan right now.
To be honest, I'm not too pleased with myself either.
I'm really not a bad person.
I'm a good person caught up in a seismically fucked-up situation,
and you're not exactly making anything easier on me right now.
I like helping people.
That's why I do what I do. My whole business is about helping people.
My clients come to me to escape their everyday troubles
and immerse themselves in a scenario, however unorthodox,
that really helps them gain some solid perspective on life.
It's just you and them, cut off from the outside world,
when they get to that microcosm where time ceased to exist
and they're forced to retreat inward and really get to know themselves better.
And I'd say...
nine and a half times out of ten,
they emerge from that experience a more fulfilled human.
Hold on a second.
Sorry about that.
[whispers] That's not what microcosm means.
Huh, what?
That thing that you just said about time standing still,
that's not what microcosm means.
Do you want some food?
Yes, asshole. I'd like some food.
It's been over 36 hours since I've eaten anything.
Right.
Well, let me see what I can whip up here.
You might wanna think about trying to fix that thing
on top of your head, also.
Oh, shit.
My sister.
She has nothing to do with this.
Her coming down in the basement, that was a total accident.
It's another reason I couldn't let you go to the cops.
You put her at the scene, that makes her an accessory. She has kids.
You're telling me you have a family that cares about you...
and you still pull this kind of shit?
They were supposed to get rid of that one. Why didn't they? Goddamn it.
This is Kendra, my ex-wife.
We met in Atlantic City. It was a long time ago.
We started this business together.
It's a huge tourism market over there.
At peak season we'd have two, three simulations going at once.
We were training personnel, we rented a warehouse...
[chuckles] We were good.
For the first time in my life, I didn't feel like a total failure.
But then...
But then I had to walk away.
Get outta town.
I guess Kendra figured she didn't need me anymore.
Got the lawyers involved, told a story or two.
I never saw it coming.
And here I am.
Did you love her?
Yeah.
Yeah. But I guess she showed me.
Can I take a shower?
I feel pretty gross. You know, I have all this... tape all over me.
I really don't think it's a good idea.
I promise you I'm not gonna make any trouble.
Where is she now?
Who knows? Who fucking cares?
You know, I was married once.
What did he do?
He left.
He broke my heart.
He didn't really want me.
But I can't really blame him 'cause I don't really know if I want me.
[shrieks, laughs] I just sat on the ball gag.
Trust me, it's been worse places.
No, don't say that. I just... That thing was just in my mouth.
What are you doing?
You're really not a kidnapper.
So, if I say that I won't go to the cops this whole thing is over.
It's all done.
-Yeah. More or less. -So you'd let me go?
Yeah, I would.
So I won't go to the cops.
I'll tell my boss, you know, something. I'll make up some kind of a story.
-You'd do that? -Yeah.
Yes.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
I'm sorry.
There's just one thing that I kind of wanna know.
Your ex-wife, what did she say?
It's just that she must've made up some terrible accusations
and I'm wondering what they are or were.
-Why are you asking me that? -Clearly she's the one that set us up.
There's nobody else that would have that kind of vendetta--
There's no vendetta.
Okay. So can you tell me what she said?
It has nothing to do with this. Just drop it.
I think you're afraid to tell me.
I think you're afraid to tell me because it's true
and because you want me to like you.
But you know what, Ray?
I don't like you.
And I'm never going to like you.
Do you wanna know why?
Because I think everything you've said is bullshit.
What I think is that you like being in control.
I think you like tying people up, I think you like feeling big.
What did you do, Ray?
Did you tie her up?
Did you push her around?
Just when we practiced the simulations.
You hit her, didn't you?
-Just the once, because she asked me to. -Did you like it?
-Do you wanna hit me? -No.
Oh, come on, Ray. I've been really bad.
-Are you sure you don't wanna hit me? -No--
-That belonged to my mother. -Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.
-You're being inconsiderate. -Am I? Do I need to be punished?
Don't.
-I'm so sorry. -[grunts]
-Ground-line hitch? -Constrictor knot.
I learned it at camp.
Okay, that's not a pellet gun.
Your brother-in-law really should've found a better hiding place.
Listen, Anna. If it's the keys to the car you're looking for, they're in my pocket.
Oh, no, no.
No. We are way past that.
I'm really sorry, Anna. You know, none of this was supposed to happen.
But it did.
It did happen.
So now we've gotta work with what we've got.
Unfortunately, Ray, I'm not quite as creative as you are.
Listen, you think you could loosen these a little?
I can't feel my hands.
Okay. Well, look, if you want the cops to come out here,
it's not gonna happen because the phones, they don't work this far out.
I know that.
I'd like you to get in the trunk, now.
No, come on.
Don't piss me off, Ray.
Get...
in...
the trunk.
-Okay. -[screams] Get in the trunk!
-[fires] -Fuck! Fuck!
You could've blown my foot off! You could've fucking crippled me!
Get in the trunk.
Okay, look. Please, I'm begging you. Don't do this.
Okay? There's...
I know I'm fucked up, okay? I know I need help.
But please don't make me get in there.
Leave me here. I don't wanna go, I wanna stay.
Oh, just do it. Just shoot me. Just kill me.
No.
No. No, don't fire. Don't fire, don't fire.
Fuck.
Are you done? I don't have time for this.
I need you to get into the trunk.
All right. Want me to go in the trunk?
Get in the trunk, Ray! Get in the trunk!
In the trunk I go. See? I'm getting in the trunk.
I'd like you to do it without the narration. Oh. Goddamn it.
Oh. Goddamn it.
You ready to test your theory about microcosms out?
Wait, wait! What are you gonna do to me?
Welcome back.
Oh, shit.
Are we at the police station or...?
Oh, no, we're at the top of my office parking lot.
I hope that that's okay.
It's just I have a lot of work to get done.
A person in my position normally can't disappear
for an entire weekend without repercussions, so...
I'm sorry, what?
Ray.
You can drop the act.
It's been 48 hours. The weekend's over. The scenario's done.
I called the police on my way over.
You really were not kidding about them being concerned, were you?
Does that usually happen?
What am I thinking? You must be dehydrated.
I know I certainly was when you had me back there.
And before you even ask, I called the bank.
They're in the process of transferring the other $2,500
from my account over to yours.
Of course I didn't factor in for incidentals,
and damages and medical expenses that were incurred during our run.
Do you have a ballpark for that, maybe?
You know what? Just think about it.
Whatever you think is fair, let me know. Fax it over and we'll, um..
We'll settle it. Ray.
I am really impressed with how in-depth your service went.
I mean, the second location? Those crazy stories?
The role reversal at the end with the rifle?
I mean, that must have taken tremendous planning,
not to mention the appropriate foresight to gauge all the variables.
I'm sorry if I went too far. I get very into the roleplay.
I like to imagine...
what it would feel like if I were really in that situation and just...
Can I talk to you about the slapping?
Honestly, I would've liked a little bit more of it.
I kept trying to goad you and goad you, but you really wouldn't take the bait.
But that... The choke at the end, was that improvised? -Mm-hm. -That was amazing.
-Mm-hm. -That was amazing. Yeah, thanks.
I really think that your concept could have legs
with the right strategy behind it.
-Oh, yeah? -Absolutely.
I'm a consultant. This is what I do for a living.
I gotta get going. I gotta get going.
...blessed our world and its people.
But in time the promise of its power brought war to our lands.
Lucis, a peaceful kingdom of great magic kept safe by the power of the crystal.
And Niflheim, a military empire of vast machinery...
...made strong by the might of its Magitek.
Long has war raged between the two.
As the years passed, Niflheim marched on nearby nations...
...driven by its unsurpassed technology.
To defend itself, Lucis raised a magical wall...
...the strength of which comes from the crystal itself.
Insomnia alone, the crown city and last bastion of Lucian defense...
...remained beyond Niflheim reach for many years.
Amid the escalating war...
...Prince Noctis of Lucis had come to Tenebrae...
...to seek healing for a grievous injury.
He made the long journey together with his father, King Regis.
Mother, brother, and I, the royalty of Tenebrae...
...had all welcomed their visit.
It was then that the fires came, everywhere and all at once.
In a mere instant, the whole of Tenebrae was ablaze.
Ravus!
Mother!
General Glauca.
The Niflheim attack was an attempt on the lives of the visiting Lucian royalty.
Noctis!
Please. Help us!
King Regis!
Lunafreya....
Luna!
From that day until this day...
...Tenebrae has been gripped in the iron fist of Niflheim...
...sworn enemy of Lucis.
King Regis assembles a force of mighty warriors to combat the imperial menace.
Dubbed the Kingsglaive, they fight relentlessly against Niflheim...
...empowered by the magic of their sovereign.
All units, move to secure the Wall.
If they break through, we're done.
What's the hold-up, Crowe?
Crowe! Status?
Almost there.
No!
I need help. East wall's going down. Pelna, can you get to me?
Lucis isn't paying us refugees enough...
...for this.
How is this fair?
Nyx, I owe you one.
You and everyone else.
We need support on the east flank. Nyx, where are you?
I'm on my way.
Pelna, fall back and regroup with the others.
Go easy on the magic, hero.
You got people waiting for you back home.
I'm worth the wait.
Show-off.
Watch your back, Libertus. We got more incoming.
We ain't gonna last much longer.
Crowe!
Yes!
All Glaives, fall back. Repeat, all Glaives fall back!
Release the daemon.
We can't take down that daemon. I'm ordering a full retreat.
Get back here alive. That's an order.
For hearth and home.
All units, fall back to the extraction point. Support is inbound.
Nyx! We have to get out of here.
-Nyx! We have orders! -Yeah.
Help!
Nyx!
That idiot.
Nyx!
Crowe. We gotta move.
You gotta be kidding me.
You know I ain't got the stomach for this crap.
Would you rather walk?
Come on. Just like Galahd Canyon back home.
Libertus!
Luche, report.
The imperial forces look to be withdrawing, sir.
Guess I owe you another one.
I'll put it on your tab.
You just try and get some rest, all right?
You disobeyed a direct order to retreat.
For hearth and home, right, sir?
As long as I got strength in my body, I obey that order.
Don't fool yourself, Nyx Ulric.
Whatever strength you have is on loan from the king.
You are nothing without him.
Await details of your reassignment.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Despite their victory all but assured.
A sudden and inexplicable retreat.
We are at risk nonetheless, Your Majesty.
We cannot know when they will strike again.
Your Majesty, word from the West Gate.
A man claiming to be an envoy of the empire requests an audience.
The envoy from Niflheim awaits without, Your Majesty.
Hello there.
Hello!
Good day to you...
...and you.
Well met, my dear Lucians.
Has Niflheim grown so bold...
...that they send the chancellor himself as envoy?
And under no guard, at that?
It is an honor to be recognized by the great King Regis.
Yet permit me to stand on ceremony and introduce myself nonetheless.
Ardyn Izunia, Chancellor of Niflheim...
...at your humble service.
And I come to you on this...
...most auspicious of days to offer terms of peace.
Peace?
As you no doubt surmised...
...that recent maneuver of ours was no strategic retreat.
Call it...
...a gesture of imperial goodwill.
Like you, we wish nothing more...
...than to bring a swift end to this senseless war.
Is that so?
It is, indeed.
And we require but a singular compliance.
Save your grand Insomnia here.
Lucis must forfeit all territories to Niflheim rule.
Insomnia!
The jewel in the crown of the Lucian kingdom.
How foolish of me to forget.
There is just one more trivial thing.
It concerns your son.
The fetching Prince Noctis of Lucis...
...and the fair Princess Lunafreya of Tenebrae....
They are to be wed.
You seem vexed, Your Highness.
I assure you, the princess still holds you in the highest regard...
...as she has done all these 12 long years.
Don't know if anyone's told you...
...but we don't take kindly to insubordination around here.
Do yourself a favor, take a look around.
This is what a hundred years of peace looks like.
It's a lasting peace made by the Wall and the Wall alone.
See, we don't need any of you immigrants...
...jumping around, playing war hero.
Hey! Rough day on the gate, huh, Glaive?
You jerk. It's your fault he got stuck there.
-Not a very nice welcome for a big hero. -Not a very nice outfit for one, either.
I think it brings out my eyes.
What'd you put in this?
Tastes like a chocobo turd.
Hey, shut your trap!
This ain't Galahd. That's the way folks around here like it.
Oh, well. I'm glad to see you're willing to sell out our heritage for a few extra gil.
Hey, Libertus. You thank Nyx for saving your life yet?
Oh, come on, Crowe. Nyx and I are too close for that.
He helps me, I help him. That's the way it's always been.
Looks like you got a little help from something else, huh?
I need all I can get.
For hearth!
-And home. -And home.
So, Nyx the Gatekeeper. How's the new post treating you?
Oh, it's amazing. You guys would love it.
The gate watch are real sweethearts.
Yeah, right.
We all know they hate us outsiders more than anything.
So bored they got nothing better to do.
Boredom's not so bad.
Means there's peace, at least.
I'd fight a hundred more wars for Galahdans to know boredom.
Fight all you want.
Just don't go dying yet.
I still owe you.
A lot.
Where would the Glaive be without its hero?
Can you not talk like this while we're drinking, please?
We just sent the Niffs running with tails between their legs, right?
They weren't running from us. No, they were toying with us.
Stop being such a buzzkill, Luche. We all know what happened.
Did you know they sent an envoy to the Citadel after that?
What for? To offer their surrender?
-More like demand ours. -What?
Demand? My ass!
No? Think about it.
The empire's got Lucis on its last legs.
It's the perfect time to make demands.
We are losing this war, Your Majesty.
Lucis cannot rely on the Kingsglaive alone.
Accepting the truce may be our best course of action.
You speak of matters beyond the New Wall.
We have no need of a truce here, so long as it stands.
And if our position worsens, we still have the Old Wall.
Yes, but this truce will end the fighting altogether.
If only we could compromise--
Compromise is unwise.
We know nothing of Niflheim's true intentions.
Do not fool yourselves. The Walls are far from impenetrable.
The paths left to us are few.
The New Wall draws its power from the throne.
I am able to sustain it for some years yet, if the kingdom requires it.
But the chancellor spoke one truth, if only one.
We are old, and the Old Wall....
I cannot command the Old Wall with a weakened hand...
...nor do I have the strength to muster an offensive to turn the tide on this war.
Then let the choice be made, Your Majesty.
What are we to protect?
Help Mother!
How come you never lose your lunch like that?
Just doesn't add up.
Here's this ancient art, secret of the royal family and all that.
Libertus! Nyx!
Come here, guys, you gotta see this.
Things were hectic in the capital today...
...as the Lucian government announced full acceptance...
...of what some are criticizing as the unilateral peace terms...
...proposed by Chancellor Izunia of Niflheim.
The signing of the truce will see power over all Lucian territories...
...transferred to the empire, with the sole exception of Insomnia.
In return, Niflheim guarantees the safety of Insomnia and its citizenry...
...as well as a cessation to all hostilities...
...bringing a decisive end to this long and bitter war.
All that fighting we did. All for nothing.
Glaives. Assemble in the briefing room.
Now.
The king has spoken, and you have heard.
All lands beyond the Wall are to be relinquished to the empire.
Will no regions be spared?
-None. -But your home's out there too!
It is.
Why would the king do this?
Because it'll end this damn war.
-Crowe. -Sir!
Prepare to deploy. You're being sent to infiltrate Tenebrae.
Tenebrae, sir?
Mission details are classified.
Report to my office for briefing in 30 minutes.
And, Nyx....
You're off the West Gate.
You've been reassigned to the castle guard.
That is all.
So this is what you were talking about, Luche?
You heard the captain.
-This wasn't our decision to make. -Not ours to make?
Those are our homes out there! Our people!
You're just gonna go along and abandon them?
If we don't go along with them...
...the empire will unleash all hell on Insomnia.
-We'll unleash it right back at them! -Easy, easy.
He's not the enemy.
Don't you get it?
We're nothing to them.
Rats, snuck in from beyond the Wall.
Sure, they had a use for us...
...when they realized we could work their magic.
So they handpicked us from all the other rats out there...
...and just let us nibble away at his royal majesty's precious power.
But as soon as this war's all over...
...it's back to the sewers for all of us.
That means you too, hero.
You missing home so much, Libertus, why don't you and Nyx head on back?
I'm sure Niflheim will welcome you with open arms.
You've got a home out there too.
Or did you forget?
Damn it!
I'm not gonna let it end like this.
It is said sentiment amongst the people is favorable, Your Majesty.
Most all will welcome this peace.
If you yourself have not heard their voices...
...how can you claim to know their hearts?
What of the mission to Tenebrae, Your Majesty?
Is such clandestine action wise?
If discovered, it will only serve to provoke the empire.
The empire remains our enemy until the treaty is signed.
So long as we are at war...
...His Majesty intends to remain one step ahead of them.
Of course.
A hairpin? I didn't think you were into that kind of thing.
It's not for me. It's a gift for the princess.
But keep that quiet. Nobody's supposed to know.
Well, that's me.
Watch your back out there.
I know you're sick of hearing it, but you're like a little--
Little sister to you. Yeah, I am sick of hearing it.
Just make sure you come back in one piece, all right?
Says the guy in two pieces.
Lady Lunafreya, I have left the rear gate open.
Thank you.
Must you go?
Yes.
Then go quickly.
I do not recall granting you permission to leave your quarters, Lunafreya.
Ravus.
You are not to leave this room again until the journey to Lucis.
It is for your own good.
My own good?
What is truly going on here?
What cause does the empire have to see me wed to Noctis?
They have offered a peace, and your marriage is the olive branch.
You expect me to believe that?
What you believe does not concern me.
What does concern me is you sneaking off...
...to go tell our mother's killer about some plot you've dreamt up.
You are wrong to hate King Regis.
Niflheim killed Mother, not him.
They murdered her and made you their lapdog.
It's done.
An air of jubilation has swept the city in anticipation of the coming armistice.
With only three days remaining until the peace is officially signed into effect...
...throngs of citizens have taken to the streets to show....
Lucis needs your strength, young warriors.
We don't need any of you immigrants.
Whatever strength you have is on loan from the king.
-You are nothing without him. -Nyx, help Mother.
Selena, get down.
--and the waves of imperial diplomats entering the city.
The princess? Are you certain?
Yes, Your Majesty.
She was amongst the last of the imperial contingent to enter the city.
Get in.
I'm reporting to my post now though, sir.
New orders.
Come on. We've got a princess to pick up.
Nice ride, sir.
It belongs to the prince.
We've taken him outside the city.
Doesn't he have a wedding to plan, sir?
Cut the "sir" crap.
The king has a plan of his own.
Prince Noctis and Princess Lunafreya are to meet far from Insomnia.
What's she doing here then?
Complicating things.
We sent Crowe to find the princess and escort her out of Tenebrae.
We're still trying to figure out what went wrong.
So I know what you think about this war, but what do you think about this peace?
You happy giving up your home?
It's the king's decision. I owe him for taking me in.
I was lucky. There are people in Galahd who weren't.
And they need me.
So you're going back?
What good will you be without the king's magic?
Yeah, always wanting to save somebody.
I get it. Believe me. But it doesn't win wars.
It's not just wanting.
It's not just me.
Libertus is the one you need to worry about.
He'll go back if things gets worse.
The worst is yet to come.
Do you have any idea who you're stopping?
Open this gate now, and maybe you'll have a job tomorrow.
-King's orders. -Are you sure you want to risk...
...a diplomatic issue now, of all times?
I am the personal escort of Lady Lunafreya Nox Fleuret...
...princess of the former Tenebrae and--
And our kingdom's beloved bride-to-be.
Welcome to sovereign jurisdiction. We'll take care of things from here.
-Forgive me, Captain Drautos. -See Her Highness to the castle.
I had no idea that you-- I wasn't made aware of any--
-Excuse me. Thank you. -No, you-- I must--
I must-- No, I have to clear it with my superiors first.
Your Highness.
Her Royal Highness, Princess Lunafreya of Tenebrae.
It has been a long time, Your Majesty.
Yes.
Far too long.
Prince Noctis isn't here, is he?
No, my dear. He is not.
I am too old to fight this war.
I have no choice but to receive the empire and accept their treaty.
Even so...
...I had hoped to hold the wedding elsewhere, somewhere safe.
I sent one of my Glaive to see you there, but--
It is not too late.
I can ready an escort.
Please, go to my son.
No.
Wherever I go, the empire will follow.
It would only place the prince in greater danger.
It is my duty to protect the prince and see his destiny fulfilled.
These 12 years have not changed that.
And what of your destiny?
My duty is my destiny, Your Majesty.
I'm prepared to accept whatever may come to pass.
So, what do you think?
All these lands will be imperial soon.
Reckon things will get better when them Niffs start calling the shots?
Not one damn bit.
Don't matter who's calling the shots.
Long as they're calling them from behind the Wall...
...ain't nothing gonna change around here.
Get over here.
All right.
That's a hand!
I trust the reunion was a happy one?
Has she been a hostage of Niflheim all this time?
She is a symbol of the peace. That's all I'm told.
Doesn't sound like it.
Sounds like she's here for something much bigger than that.
Your orders are to protect her.
Not to look, not to listen, not to think.
Understood?
Drautos.
Yes, report.
Get the hell out of my way. That's my friend you got in there, damn it.
Sir, you can't go in until the examination has ended.
What examination? What the hell's going on?
Hey, take it easy, big guy.
These bastards rushed Crowe in there the moment she got back.
And now they won't let me in to see her.
Wait.
Crowe's personal effects.
Do with them as you see fit.
So, what kind of mission did you really send her on?
No Glaive winds up dead on a standard escort.
I'll see the armistice does not interfere with a full investigation.
She was a good soldier.
Her death will not go unanswered.
What a life, huh?
She was brought up an orphan.
Run out of her village.
I still remember the first time I saw her.
Scrawny little thing...
...all covered in dirt.
Not a friend in the world.
But those eyes....
Damn.
There was something about those eyes.
She deserved better.
And I would've done anything to give it to--
Libertus, wait.
Crowe died a Glaive.
You can still honor her by fighting as one.
You're dumber than me sometimes, you know that?
Don't you get it?
Lucis killed Crowe.
Go back to the castle.
Tell the king there's no peace to be had from throwing the weak to the wolves.
I'll fight my own fight from here on out.
See you around, hero.
A hairpin?
I didn't think you were into that kind of thing.
It's not for me. It's a gift for the princess.
A most grand reception, King Regis.
You honor all of Niflheim.
Oh, the honor is ours, Emperor Aldercapt.
You have ventured far to grace us with your presence.
It was the very least I could do.
Tomorrow will be an historic day for both our nations.
And your Insomnia is truly a marvel.
My own cities pale in comparison.
I pray we are able to take away much from this visit.
Hello.
I am afraid we were never properly introduced yesterday.
I'm afraid it's going to have to wait, Your Highness. I'm on guard duty.
Then surely there's no safer place for me to be.
May I ask your name?
Nyx. Nyx Ulric.
There is something else I wish to ask you, Nyx Ulric.
King Regis said he sent one of your order to come find me.
I should like to offer my thanks in person.
Where might I find this brave soldier?
Oh, I did not--
-I am so sorry. -Don't be.
Here.
She was carrying this.
It was meant for you.
For me?
Keep it.
She would've wanted you to have it.
I will carry it with me always.
Thank you.
Do you have any idea what this peace means?
It means our homes are gone...
...all of them...
...forever.
Heard I could find some treaty haters here.
I come to the right place?
You certainly have.
Everyone say hello to a man who spends his days...
...in the loyal service of our good king.
"Spent."
Those days are over.
I'm done listening to that bastard's lies.
He may sit on a throne, but he ain't no king...
...least not of mine.
Well, then...
...welcome to the resistance, brother.
I hope you're here to talk.
What do you wanna know?
Please...
...wherever Noctis is, keep him safe.
That is all I ask.
To what god do you pray?
You, the slave of fate and destiny.
Abandon your prayers.
The gods do not listen.
General Glauca. Why are you here?
You are far too clever to have ever believed in this peace.
Pity you couldn't see your beloved Noctis. You have another purpose.
-I'm not here for Niflheim. -No.
You are here for me.
You?
I do not understand.
Come tomorrow, you will.
Niflheim contingent has left the hotel.
Less than three hours until the ceremony.
Bolster the Citadel guard.
Nyx, is the princess with you?
No.
I'm on duty at the Citadel.
Well, the Niffs just left for the ceremony.
And she wasn't with them.
-A homing beacon? -Yeah, I'll send the coordinates now.
Can you pinpoint a location for me?
Sure, but it sounds like a wild-goose chase.
Guess you got some free time on your hands, huh?
Guess I do, for better or worse.
Those coordinates are about 20 miles south of Insomnia.
Outside the Wall.
What the hell was Crowe doing all the way out there?
No, no. They sent her to--
I need another favor, Pelna.
Pull those coordinates up on the radar and let me know what you find.
On it. You're thinking this is all a big deal now, huh?
Yeah, too big to ignore.
-Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. -Hey, hey, hey.
-Whoa, wait a minute. -Stop right there.
Listen up. This is not the gate watch.
This is the heart of our city, the home of our king.
The ceremony must not be disturbed.
Neutralize any threat quickly and quietly.
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.
Glaive to command. Are you there, captain?
Urgent.
Damn it, Drautos.
Jackpot, Nyx. There's a whole fleet of airships sitting at that spot.
-Niflheim. -Yup, and from the looks of it...
...I'd say they're headed to war.
-Where's the captain? -Should be at the Citadel.
There's no answer on his frequency.
I don't know, must have his hands full with the escort detail.
Pelna, one last favor. I need you to prep the Glaive for action.
What are you talking about?
You wanna deploy without the captain's order?
Trust me. Just get it done.
Wait, what am I supposed to tell--?
Stand down, Glaive.
The ceremony is in less than two hours.
We must make ready.
Very well.
Your Majesty.
A man of the Kingsglaive is here, sire.
He demands an audience.
"Demands"?
-Your Majesty, please. -Halt.
Give the order to deploy the Glaive.
You.
A Niflheim fleet makes ready for war 20 miles to the south.
An imperial fleet.
And they have the princess.
Clarus, post guards outside the treaty room.
It will be seen as a lack of faith in the peace.
Which we all harbor.
See it done.
We may well have to take Emperor Aldercapt into custody.
Detain him?
That would go beyond a new declaration of war.
We are still at war, Clarus.
And you, Nyx Ulric.
How soon can the Kingsglaive deploy?
On your word, at once.
Go, then.
Save Luna.
What if this is a diversion?
Not likely.
Tenebrae's princess is onboard.
We've got two jobs.
Save her.
And stop those Niff ships from flying on Insomnia.
We go in teams.
Standard infiltrate and extract.
Nyx, you command. We'll follow.
The Glaive stands together, captain or no.
For hearth.
And home!
We are less than 20 minutes away from the signing of this historic treaty.
I received word of the king's order to deploy.
I'll see to matters in the city.
You have your mission, and it won't be easy.
The objective is two-fold.
Secure the hostage, and stay the enemy advance.
Just be careful.
One Glaive already died for this princess.
Niflheim won't give her up easily.
Team Two.
Oh, man.
Hurry up, Nyx!
Help!
Over here.
Preparing to head below deck.
Do not engage the enemy until instructed.
The ceremony is underway.
Let's wait and see how Niflheim plays this.
The Kingsglaive have infiltrated the ships.
So everything's going according to plan.
Ulric reporting. Six Niflheim airships confirmed inbound for Insomnia.
Nyx, this doesn't feel like a war fleet.
I think I might've found her. I got a guarded door here.
Two Niff MTs. What's the plan?
Hold position.
Arrived at destination. High possibility of target in the vicinity.
Proceed to secure.
It's going to mean a fight.
Keep it quiet and keep it confined.
Pelna, you're clear to engage. But keep it quiet.
I'm on my way.
Forgive my delay.
A bit of unforeseen trouble.
Nothing too vexing, I hope.
A simple theft, nothing more.
A daring thief, to steal from the king.
Perhaps magical walls and castle gates do not keep all things safe.
Perhaps.
But no matter. That which was taken will soon be returned.
Impressive.
You are a paragon of kingly composure.
But I must ask...
...how can you be so sure?
Because this thing is no mere trinket.
It possesses a will all its own.
Enough to break any thief's grasp.
That sounds a very fine prize indeed.
Not now, damn it.
For me? You shouldn't have.
Target confirmed. She's unharmed.
The Glaives have recovered the princess, Your Majesty.
Have you found your thief?
We have.
And what was stolen remains intact.
Joyous news.
I am relieved to hear it.
Tell me...
...how heavy a sentence...
...does the crime of theft carry in your empire?
Among the heaviest.
Although there is one...
...exception.
Things are about to get ugly over here.
Pelna, get out of there. It's a trap.
-What is that? -A curious old law...
...I still permit in the outlands.
A thief who escapes his captor...
...can no longer be held to account for his crime.
A warning to the victim.
Never show weakness, lest you forgo the hand of justice.
Oh, no, good king.
Far from it.
The treaty is now on the table.
The countdown begins to this historical moment.
It is a warning to the hand of justice itself...
...never to loose its grip.
Unit One, secure the perimeter.
Unit Two, stand your ground.
Pelna.
One Tenebrae princess, safe and--
Come on.
The crystal. They're after the crystal.
There's something going on below deck.
The ship's not going to make it to Insom--
You....
What's going on?
Insomnia is under attack.
Who brought you here?
-General Glauca. -You were bait.
Us coming here was all part of their plan.
Target secured. Request permission to withdraw.
Granted. Get to--
The crystal will not serve you.
Nor you...
...once I take it from this accursed city.
It's not the crystal I'm here for.
The Wall. It's gone.
Fall back. It's a trap.
What the hell is going on?
Traitors.
What's got into you?
Come, we must escape while we can.
No, Clarus.
I fear escape is no longer an option.
General Glauca.
Can you make it up? Can you stand?
Luche!
What are you doing?
You gotta be kidding me.
They teach piloting back at the royal academy?
Give me that.
Been a long time since I fought at your side, old friend.
Yes...
...but this time it is not your fight.
If you wish to leave, go now.
And abandon my king? I think not.
Besides, our magic is bound to you.
If you fall, Lucis falls.
Then let us once more into the fray...
...old friend.
You must take me back to King Regis.
Are you out of your mind? Insomnia's a war zone.
I have a duty. I cannot neglect it.
-Yeah, I heard all that before. -Then you know we must hurry.
Hurry to do what? Get yourself killed?
I do not fear death.
Enough with all this brave princess act.
Just pray this thing will make the trip.
Clarus.
Well, I daresay everything has proceeded according to plan.
-No? -So it has.
We have broken the Wall.
All that remains is to break the city.
Shall we take our leave, then?
The sun will soon set.
We need not be here to witness the terrors of the night.
The crystal.
You're going too fast. We have to land.
-You're gonna have to give me a minute. -There is no time. I will go on my own.
You got wings underneath that dress? You can't use magic.
Not all miracles are made by magic.
I do not fear death.
What I fear is doing nothing and losing everything.
Oh, come on.
You can thank magic for that miracle, Your Highness.
The reckoning is at hand.
Dawn of a new age.
You have the crystal. What more would you take from me?
The Ring of the Lucii.
I lost my mother, my country, my birth-right.
Niflheim was the only life left to me.
But all of that was for this.
The ring belongs to me now.
Hear me, Lucian kings of old, for I am Ravus Nox Fleuret...
...and none is more worthy of your power than I.
No. Why?
Why do you refuse me?
Look out.
Quickly, through here.
This leads to a hidden passageway.
Follow it.
Once you are away, make for Altissia.
Noctis awaits you there.
-Your Majesty. -You knew this was coming--
Yes. But it was the only way to draw their wrath from Noctis.
Is that the way of our king?
Sacrifice Lucian sons to save his own?
To save the world.
See Luna safely to Altissia.
This is not an order from a king to his Glaive.
This is a plea from one man to another. Please, Nyx Ulric, keep her safe.
For the future of all.
The future?
Here.
Take this.
It is time it passed to another's keeping.
No, please. Stop.
-Get back. -Please. Don't leave us.
I know your mother would wish the same as me.
That you and Noctis live happily.
All those years captive because I failed you.
Not again.
Locked doors will seal your fate no longer.
King Regis....
Our hope goes with you now, Nyx Ulric. Godspeed.
Behold the King of Lucis...
...who hoarded tranquility within his precious walls.
Where is your tranquility now, king?
Here is your peace, by steel's swift descent.
Go.
No. We must get away from here.
It is what your king wanted.
Lady Lunafreya has escaped with the ring.
Find her at once.
She is not to leave the city.
-Ulric to command. Come in, captain. -Footage of the perpetrators...
...was captured by a nearby surveillance camera.
Here are images of the six suspects.
One has been identified as Galahdian refugee, Libertus Ostium...
...a former member of the Lucian Kingsglaive.
Hey, come here. Come here.
I got you, I got you. You're all right.
You're okay.
It's fine.
We're free.
We're free now.
We're free? What do you mean, "We're free"?
The empire. They promised.
This district's ours.
All the refugees.
It's our new home.
-The empire? You went in with Niflheim? -Here.
Take this. Meet up with the others.
You're the hero of our revolution, brother.
Damn it.
This guy just doesn't know when he's beat.
-Can you drive? -I can try.
I'll be right back.
No warping for you this time, hero.
Give me the wheel. Go.
You are without your magic.
You noticed that, huh? It must have died with the king.
You're making a mess of my city, Glaive. I thought I told you not to go playing hero.
Leave the ship to me.
Looks like you got a royal fare to see to.
Move it.
Maybe not all miracles are made by magic.
Oh, great.
The hell did you do to piss these things off?
It's not me they're after. It's the ring.
What's so special about this ring? Don't tell me the future's riding on it.
He who wears the ring communes with the Lucii...
-...and commands great power. -What kind of power?
A forbidden one. Sealed within the ring, long ago.
The Old Wall. I thought that was just a bedtime story.
I can assure you it is not.
But the Lucii grant their power only to those they deem worthy.
So that guy who tried it on back there...
...I guess he wasn't deemed worthy.
That was my brother.
These 12 years have changed Ravus.
He is bound by the past, and lost in his lust for power.
How the hell did they find us?
Your hairpin. They're tracking it. Give it to me.
I had a little sister once. She was killed when the empire came.
I couldn't save her.
I was as helpless then as I am now.
I couldn't show her the future she wanted.
True power is not something that is found by those who seek it.
It is something that comes to those who deserve it.
Your sister wanted you to see a future as well.
Anyone would wish the same for family they love.
You don't pull any punches, do you?
I'm over here.
Do you hear me? Repeat, this is Drautos.
Can you hear me? Over.
Your timing's impeccable, captain.
If the Lucii are real...
...they sure don't seem to mind their city getting torn apart.
You're to rendezvous and regroup. Understood?
Might not be so easy, captain.
My wings have been clipped, if you didn't know.
Ulric. Are you all right?
I'm not dead, if that's what you mean, sir.
Head for Section D as soon as you can.
I'll have an evacuation team ready.
Don't suppose you could meet me at the gate.
I'd kind of like to get the hell out of this city.
Imperials hold all exits. There's no way through.
I'll meet you at Section D.
Cut all radio contact until then. And make sure you get there.
It's a date, sir.
Ain't no turning back now.
Status report.
Ulric killed some good men.
-What about the ring? -We don't have it yet.
This is Glauca. King Regis is dead.
The ring is on its way to Section D.
We must recover the ring to realize our goal.
If Ulric or the princess get in the way, take them out.
Reclaim our hearth and home.
"Hearth and home"?
Libertus, come in.
Where are you? Are you all right?
I'm fine.
On the way back to base now.
We need you to head to the junction in Section D.
We're gonna join with another unit, make a clean sweep of the place.
We're one step away from realizing this revolution.
Let's not let Pruvia's death be in vain.
We'll be waiting for you, hero.
-Don't move until I say it's safe, all right? -I won't.
Ulric, reporting.
I have the princess.
She's alive and well.
-No! -Get out of here.
You've got some fight in you, Nyx, I'll give you that.
Run. Now.
I can't believe you're still moving with that hollowpoint in you.
All Crowe could do was scream, when one tore her insides apart.
-Why'd you do it? -Because the Kingsglaive is nothing.
An old man's battle fodder...
...sent to die in Insomnia's war...
...while our homes are bound and shackled.
Niflheim took your home.
Took all our homes!
Nothing will ever change that.
You never were too smart.
You could've had a new future with the empire.
There's nowhere to run, princess.
The ring.
Give it to me.
So many dead over so simple a thing.
But why? For what?
Power.
Untold power, beyond the control of someone like you.
Power....
Captain.
Nyx.
It's over. The daemons are unleashed.
Lucis is fallen.
Surrender the ring.
Plan on giving those kings a piece of your mind, princess?
You got a destiny to take care of here, remember?
Besides, didn't anyone tell you?
I'm the hero around here.
Show yourselves, kings of Lucis.
You call upon the wards of this world's future, mortal.
And if you come lusting for our power, you must first stand in our judgment.
How long will you do nothing whilst Insomnia burns?
Old or new, or whatever it is.
Summon your Wall.
You do not command us.
Yours is not even royal blood.
It does not fall to us to guard your city.
Man is a fool creature...
...clinging to his past and cowering from his future.
Wasting his strength on bygone days.
And what future are you wards of?
So shortsighted.
And cursed never to rise above it.
Wait.
I have seen what this brave soul is prepared to do.
He, too, seeks to safeguard the future.
Your Majesty.
Very well, young king. We will weigh your warrior's worth.
But our boon does not come cheap.
The cost is a life. His or hers.
No.
To hell with your power.
I'm not here for it.
I only came to tell you, you are no kings.
Your worth has been weighed and found wanting.
Now burn.
You're going to lose your precious ring.
But it's not too late to save it.
You mean to barter for your life.
No, no.
My life is nothing.
Giving a future to those who want to see it...
...is everything.
You do not fear, even if that future is doomed.
If that sentiment is not false, perhaps you are worthy.
We will grant you our light.
But know it will set when the sun rises.
And the price for it will be your life.
You guys drive a hard bargain.
Where do I sign?
I could get used to this.
Nyx....
-I'm sorry. -Don't be.
You saved me.
Now I owe you.
For a change.
I'm gonna need another favor.
Meet Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, our prince's beloved bride-to-be.
And she has the future of the world in her hands.
Keep her safe, get her out of Insomnia.
Oh, I almost forgot. You'll need this.
Give Prince Noctis my regards.
Libertus will take care of you from here.
Have a safe journey, Your Highness.
-What will come of you? -What the hell are you doing?
Following the kings' orders.
I will see the ring to Noctis.
The future will be safe. I swear it.
Planning on punching your way out of the city? Keep it.
-Now we're even. -No.
We'll settle up once you're back in Galahd.
Me and everyone else will be waiting for you.
I'm counting on you...
...hero.
-Buckle up, princess. -My life is in your hands.
So, the power of the Lucii returns.
No matter. You are out of time.
For you, I'll make some.
What can you hope to do?
One man against an empire.
Against the daemons.
How will you save Insomnia with no wall to protect you?
You've got it all wrong. I'm not fighting to save Insomnia.
So this is the might of the Old Wall.
Marvelous. Truly marvelous.
Why'd you do it?
Lucis. Niflheim.
It isn't who we fight for that matters, only what.
We fight for our homes. That is where our allegiance lies.
That's not something you see every day.
Oh, such a pitiable waste.
All those beautiful city streets, all laid to unsightly ruin.
-I will return to Niflheim. -So soon?
The crystal is ours.
Finish this...
...and see the daemons disposed of.
As you command.
Such a pitiable waste.
How could you serve the empire?
After everything they did?
I do not fault them for taking what was given.
I fault the man who gave it.
The man who cowered behind his wall...
...and abandoned us to save his throne and his son.
Give me the ring, and our homes will be free again.
The empire has promised it.
I don't see much of a future on the other side of that promise.
Don't be a fool.
Save your friends.
Give your dead sister peace.
What do you fight for if not that?
Hang on. This could get bumpy.
Drautos.
Here, take the wheel.
Floor it!
-Libertus! -Just keep your foot on the gas.
You're all right?
I'll be waiting for you, hero.
What of your kings' power now?
They've given you a burden you cannot hope to bear.
I told you before.
Just wanting doesn't win wars.
For the honor of my home, I fought and killed under a king I loathed.
And still he betrayed me.
He betrayed us all.
We fought for the same thing. All of us.
But you've looked too long on the past.
You're blind to the future.
Predictable.
Unlike you, I learn from history.
But you're a slave to the past.
A man's past is his pride.
No.
My pride is shaping the future.
Looks like I'm gonna owe him big.
We're almost there.
Almost.
King Regis did what he did for the future.
Because of him...
...there's still hope for our homes.
Hope....
Not the worst way to go.
Rule well, young king.
We should move.
It ain't safe here either.
Hey.
Don't worry about Nyx.
He can take care of himself.
Come on.
No.
We must part ways here.
What?
I can hardly travel in secrecy alongside so great a hero.
And I, too, have a promise to keep to Nyx.
I pray you two see each other again soon.
Yeah.
Me too.
Thank you, Libertus.
Hey, queen!
You and the king are always welcome in Galahd.
Me and Nyx will be waiting for you.
It's been some while.
Do you remember the last time you saw Lady Lunafreya?
About 12 years ago.
That would make you 8?
-You were kids. -Hope she hasn't gotten her hopes up.
Why not? Calm yourself.
Try and keep it together when you meet her.
-She'll expect to see a fine, young prince. -Tell me something I don't know.
We don't have time for all that.
But this is your wedding we're talking about, Noc.
Knew that too.
You really gotta calm down.
I'd have the rest of my life to tell folks how I'd made history.
Well, I signed up July 11, 2001,
two months before that really meant something.
Oh, I'd love to say, "I'm here to fight for freedom."
But honestly... I joined the Reserves for the college money.
I don't belong here. And I'm ashamed of that.
A war story can't be true unless it's got some shame attached to it.
[Cole] Hey! Ocre!
What do you think?
Pokey was my dog's name.
Mirra Loma's the name of the street I grew up on. Oh.
It's my porn name. I'm going balls deep in Iraq, get it?
Yeah, yeah. Clever.
That coming off?
-Yeah. Yeah, headin' that way. -Just in time. Armored's rollin' out.
This place will be a ghost town. Ticktock, ticktock. Right?
Right.
Hey, if I don't see you for the rest of the war, be safe.
You too.
A little pressure.
Scale of one to ten, how's the pain?
[stammers] It's a ten.
Whatever the suggested dose, double it. That'll handle the discomfort.
Discomfort? Nah, I... [scoffs] I can't even make a fist. I can't roll out like this.
Let me see your hand.
-A door did that? -Yeah.
I've seen guys rollin' out with a lot worse.
[newscaster] Here's one of the potential targets. When you're in Baghdad, it's really quite...
That a boy, Enzo.
-[Enzo groaning] -Get it!
I'm telling you guys, I'm gonna be on the cover of Men's Health, fuckin' two big-old-tittied chicks on each arm,
waves splashing on my pecs and shit.
Chutsky, we're gonna see you on the cover of Out Magazine
with a dick in each hand and shame in your eyes. Like this.
Hey, you smell that?
-[sniffs] Smells like pussy. -Why would it smell like pussy?
Oh, hey, Ocre.
[Enzo] What's up? We were just talking about you.
[Chutsky] You look like shit. That malaria pill is giving me nightmares.
[Enzo] This whole place is a nightmare, man. So... what'd the doc say?
Yeah. I'm good.
[Burton] Welcome back.
-Did you see Armored's rolling out? -Come again?
Whoa! Is that true?
Yeah. And I saw Cole loading the Abrams.
Sergeant Harper, are we staging?
I know what you know, Chutsky. Come on. What do I know? Tell me what I know.
Hey, Sarge, if we are staging, we should start moving.
Guys, Command will let us know when they're ready.
Army's kept me in a cage for six weeks, Sergeant Harper.
Ooh, time to let me out. [growls]
So how's the hand feel?
-It's not a problem. -Okay.
Get the stick, huh?
What are you doing here?
Uh, whatever you tell me to, Sergeant.
That's a very good answer. But that's not what I mean. [grunts]
You're a smart guy.
Smarter than most of these boys.
Why aren't you being all the fuck you can be somewhere else, huh?
Well, uh, it was laundry day when I signed up.
[straining] Needed the free T-shirt.
Come on, Ocre.
I don't know. My dad was in, my granddad.
Something you did, you know?
[MacGregor] Glorious day for the infantry, Sergeant Harper.
As you were.
Hooah, Sergeant Major. Which way is the shit rolling, Lieutenant?
Downhill, as always.
[MacGregor] Just as gravity intended, son. We're being moved up the manifest.
Chalk Two packs as slow as my fuckin' wife, apparently.
Roger that, sir. We're gonna be about an hour till we're square here.
Well, better make it 30.
You boys proud and ready?
Proud and ready, Sergeant Major. Proud and ready.
Yeah, you got that right. Beautiful goddamn day for the infantry.
[Chutsky] Burton? There's no way. Not this guy.
-[Enzo] All day. Burton. -This little... this little...
-[Enzo] All day. Burton. -This little... this little... little baby-faced, wet-nosed puppy dog, Care Bear motherfucker right here?
little baby-faced, wet-nosed puppy dog, Care Bear motherfucker right here?
[Enzo] Yeah, I'm outside. I don't know none of this shit's going on, right?
So I'm looking up, and I swear to God, just as the first fireworks went off,
Mitch comes flying through the front door,
face bloodied, mangled, just all messed up.
And then out of the corner of my eye, I see this white flash comin'. I look over.
It's Burton taking a running leap off my front porch.
Came down on him with the knee, like this. Boom!
He grabs him by the ponytail, drags him to the middle of the street
and beat the brakes off of this grown man.
I mean, he hit him with shit I ain't never seen before.
-What, and everyone just watched? -Yeah.
-[Enzo chuckles] -Damn, Burton.
Bottom line, his mom took care of me when I was a kid.
Yeah.
This guy was a piece of shit. He got what was coming to him. -That's it. -[Enzo chuckles]
You need, like... like, anger management for that.
No, I'm good. [exhales heavily]
[officer on radio] You're clear to cross phase line, Alpha.
Well, I got really into Pilates.
Roger that, Noble Lion. We are ready to go. Over.
Guys, game on. Let's go. Come on.
Baghdad or bust, bitches.
Cigarette?
No, I'm good, thanks. Don't smoke.
-Keep me safe up there. -You know it.
[MacGregor] Yeah, let's get it up!
-[both exclaim] -Gonna ask you boys to get to your war.
Whoever built that berm,
if they ain't scared, they're gonna get scared.
Double time!
March!
[chuckling] Shit.
-[Enzo] That fuckin' sucks. -Yeah, no shit.
All right. Well, you're gonna have to flank.
All right. Well, Charlie team's got a... a team across the way. Maybe I could flank with them.
Oh, Chutsky, you want it? Go get it, boy.
-Hey, Burton. -Yeah?
[Chutsky] Give me some smoke!
Hey, hey, hey, but don't bum-rush the guy, okay?
Command does not want us destroying a mosque.
-It's gonna be a bad PR problem. -Fuckin' liberals.
I don't think it's coming from the mosque. I saw muzzle flashes behind it.
-What building? -[panting]
I, uh... I think he's in the hotel.
Hotel. I'm gonna take the kid.
-[Harper] All right, Ocre. -Hey, Burton!
-[Harper] Go on, point it out! -Rockin' and rollin'. You ready?
-Let's go. Follow me, Ocre! -[Matt] Moving.
[Chutsky] Oh! Shit!
Fuck! Shit. Fuck me!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[Kidwell] All right, all right!
Where's the CO?
-CO! -[Chutsky] Right here, Sergeant!
[Kidwell] CO! Get over here!
[Chutsky] All right, private here knows where the fire's coming from.
-[Kidwell] Where's it coming from? -He's thinking the hotel.
[Matt panting] He's in the hotel.
[Kidwell] Alpha, follow him.
Bravo, with me. All right, on me!
[Chutsky] Ocre!
[soldier] You got it.
Move.
Move.
Set.
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move!
[Chutsky] Contact! Contact! Southeast building.
Ocre, cover fire! Out the window.
-[gunfire] -Guys, get the fuck up the stairs!
All right. Ocre, cover fire.
I got ya. I got ya. Oh, you're good. -[soldier grunts] -You're good. You're good.
Just quit your bellyaching. You're fine. Just a little gun wound.
All right, help me out here. Help me out. God damn.
-[Matt] He okay? -Fuckin' do something.
Yeah, we're fine. We're fine.
-All right, Ocre, you're with me. -Yeah.
You, follow me.
[chuckles] Call it in.
Noble Lion, this is Eagle One. Do you copy?
[officer on radio] Go ahead, Eagle One.
Sniper fire is not coming from the mosque. I repeat, not the mosque.
It is confirmed from the hotel.
It is, uh, 260 degrees and... What is it, about 100 meters from the mosque?
Hundred and fifty.
And 150 meters from the mosque. Over.
Do you have a floor number, Eagle One? Over.
Wait, one... Yo, they want a fucking floor number.
Floor number? Do they want a room number, too?
Is this motherfucker ordering room service?
Get the fuck up top. Get 'em a fuckin' floor number.
[grunting] God damn.
-And watch your head. -Yeah.
[Chutsky] Shit. Whoo!
Yeah. Third floor, southeast corner.
-You say third floor, southeast corner? -Yeah.
Fuck.
Fuck that!
Noble Lion, this is Eagle Two. [panting]
Sniper fire is too heavy.
I'm suggesting an air strike. Over.
-What the hell are you doing? -What a clusterfuck of a...
Chutsky?
-[sighs] It's just such a clusterfuck. -Hey. No, no, no, Chutsky.
This whole thing is such a fucking clusterfuck. No. No, no, no. Sergeant... Hey, Sergeant, we're too close.
We're not too close. We're right where we need to be.
Sergeant, how long do we have? Can I move? Do we have time to move?
No, we don't have time to fuckin' move. We called in an air strike. Stay put.
[straining] Okay. Hang on.
[Chutsky mutters] I mean, we're sitting here all day.
It's hot as shit. My balls are sweating.
Fuckin' salt stains under my arm and shit.
-[helicopter approaching] -Oh, yeah.
Keep your head down. We've got fuckin' backup.
You lose, motherfucker!
Oh, fuck. That's why I'm in Baghdad. That's why I'm in fucking Baghdad!
-Ocre! You deaf? -What?
Ocre! You about to puke?
[softly] I'm good.
Whoo! We fuckin' did it, sir.
[Chutsky] That was the most American shit I've ever seen.
Yeah, come on out, Chutsky. Walk out now. We're coming from the north.
Ready them titties, Kansas City.
Corporal Enzo, hero, will be home soon.
Okay, right here. Right here. Right here.
[Enzo] Oh, I'm a bad man.
-Let's go. Dismount. -Yo, I'mma get all kinds of titties.
Big titties, little titties, fuckin' medium titties.
Oh, shit. I'll be straight up, man. Back home I was fucking threes, fours.
After a story like this, I'm definitely fucking fives, sixes,
maybe even a seven if I catch me a drunk patriot.
-What's the sitrep, Sergeant? -[Enzo grunts]
Uh, we've got a WIA on the roof.
Uh, Charlie Team Three's medevaccing him right now.
Ocre and I blew up a building.
[chuckles] Yeah, you did. All right, good job. Good job, Private Ocre.
Yeah, he can't hear you.
-Ocre! -[Matt] Huh? Come here.
How you feel?
Underpaid.
All right. I'll be sure to pass your complaint on to management. Come on.
Hey, don't let these little mini-jihadists get too close.
Fuckin' little bombs strapped all over 'em and shit.
[officer on radio] All elements, this is Sierra Two-Eight.
Primary mission, collect all primary intelligence requirements.
Bag it and tag it.
Area has been cleared. But keep your head on a swivel, boys.
And welcome to your new home.
Is this a photo op or what? Take a picture.
Wait, wait, wait.
I gots to do this one. Yeah, boy!
-Hey! Hey! -Bad motherfucker. Hey, knock that shit off. Come on.
-Let's go, Corporal. -Sorry, Sergeant.
[Burton] Get the fuck outta here, bro!
[Enzo] Does anybody fuckin' knock anymore? I'm trying to have a moment, motherfucker!
[Chutsky] Hey! Hey, I found Saddam's porn stash.
-[Burton] What? Hold up. -[Chutsky] There's... Oh, my God.
I'm taking off my pants now!
[Anthony] Oh, yeah, Cannonball Run, The Longest Yard, Navajo Joe, Hooper.
[chuckles] This isn't porn. These are Burt Reynolds movies.
[Chutsky] Huh, guess that explains Saddam's 'stache.
[Matt Lauer] Are you worried that if we don't find significant evidence
[Matt Lauer] Are you worried that if we don't find significant evidence in the coming weeks and months,
that our credibility and the integrity of this country is in jeopardy?
Uh, I, of course...
Did my guys roll out yet?
They're running behind. Having trouble with the load.
[stuttering] Uh, can I get one of those?
Thank you.
Is that, uh, good? Good. Shukraan.
[Burton] All right, motherfuckers, it's ready. Let's get it moved.
[Enzo] Hey... Shut up, motherfucker.
Burton! Do you remember Steph Bertolini? With all the ass?
Oh, the, uh... That chick with polio?
She did not have fuckin' polio! How many times we gotta go over this shit?
It was, like, a leg thing or, like, she had, like, a baby foot or something...
Oh, my God, it... it couldn't have been polio,
-'cause they cured that in fuckin' 1957. -[Chutsky] And why do you know that?
Because, asshole, I looked it up.
Yeah, you looked it up 'cause you thought your girl had polio, so...
-Well, fuck you very much. -Here. Here. Here.
You know what? I'm hitting every pothole and every fuckin'...
Let's take a picture with this guy.
-[John McCain] In 1991... -[Harper] Give me the comm. -...he had weapons of mass destruction. -All right, Jim?
Uh, Eagle Four, this is Eagle Six.
Whatever the delay, pick up the fuckin' pace. Over.
-[soldiers laughing on radio] -[Enzo] Eagle Six, this is Eagle Four.
Why do you hate me when I love you so much? Over.
Now, Corporal. Out.
-You guys all right? -[Enzo laughing]
-All right, ready? -Come on, take it. Come on.
-One, two, three. America! -[all] America!
-Oh, that's solid. -[Chutsky] Do I look good?
-Yeah! Look at this... -All right, load him up.
[Burton] Let's get him in. One, two, three.
-[Matt] Hold this. -All right.
[Enzo] Y'all fuckin' around with my taste in women and shit.
-All right, hop in, hopscotch. -No, I'm not going in the back.
Get the fuck in the car. I'm the biggest. That doesn't make sense.
Sergeant, Private. Get in the fucking back.
[Enzo] Oh, he pulled rank on your ass!
-[Chutsky] You're gonna love it. -[Enzo] You got no jokes now, huh, boy?
[Chutsky] All right. You can touch him. -Just keep below the waist. -Yeah, great.
-Just keep below the waist. -Yeah, great. -[Enzo] He's gonna touch his hajji peepee. -[sighs]
[Chutsky] Oh, Enzo, yo, came up with a nickname.
[Enzo] You can't come up with your own nickname, man.
That shit's gay. Nobody's gonna fuckin' call you by it but you.
[Chutsky] Boss Murderer.
-[Enzo] Okay, so that's badass. -[Chutsky] Yeah? -That is badass. -That's why I said it.
[Enzo] I'mma give you that one.
Shit. Hey! Hey, guys! Guys, he just moved!
Hey! Hey! Hey, he's not dead!
[Enzo] What the fuck is going down?
-Hold up! -Open up! He moved! He's not dead!
Calm the fuck down. What are you talking about?
-He's fucking movin'. -What the fuck?
What the hell you talking about?
-Oh, shit! -See?
-Hey! Whoa! Are you crazy? -What the fuck?
Will you put the gun down? It's 113 degrees, all right?
He's thawing out. That's why he's jumping around like a catfish.
-You sure? -Will you chill out? Put that shit away.
This shit ain't funny, Burton, man! I almost had a fuckin' heart attack!
Mission came down.
0200 this morning, an Apache spotted a weapons exchange.
Unleashed hell on a truck filled with RPGs.
Hey, whereabouts are we talking?
Small village up north. Outskirts of Baqubah.
I mean, a Toyota filled with dead terrorists... doesn't seem like a big problem, sir.
No, the big problem is the big fucking hole we left in their water station when the Apaches fired on them.
Command wants some of our guys to attach to the SF team on the ground.
You'll report to a Captain Syverson and run water to the town.
-What do you mean? Like delivery boys? -That, and we're giving you some capital
to get the locals working with the engineers on the pumping station.
Look, Lieutenant, everybody's been talking about going home.
And now you want us to go to some place we don't control. For what? A photo op?
Yeah.
[chuckles] Christ. You look like you went swimming.
-There was no ventilation back there. -Oh, that's why I ride up top.
I see more of the country than anyone else.
Nah. Nah, you couldn't pay me enough to ride the turret.
We hit shit, all the fire's coming your way, buddy.
Yeah, that's true. [chuckles]
But when we get home, I'll remember the breeze, sunshine.
Like you'll remember sitting in the dark, sweating your ass off.
[Enzo] Are we just fucking allergic to good news or what?
Special Forces? We don't do that shit.
That's true.
Look, guys, I don't want anybody who's not fully on board. Okay?
You don't want in, you let me know, and I'll get you replaced.
Oh, I think you should take the tampon out of your ass.
All right? I'm tired of this whole Green Zone shit.
I'm in.
[Enzo scoffs] I fuckin' knew it.
Hey. You go, I go. You want that on your conscience?
Are you a grown man? Then make your own decisions.
Can we at least get the sat phone to call home?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll make it happen.
[Matt] Hey, Sergeant, you done?
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I was just calling my fiancée.
Well, how is she doing?
I got the... the answering machine.
You tell her much about Iraq?
Only the stuff that won't worry her. I figure what's the point, right?
Yeah. I mean, my mom thinks I work in the kitchen.
I told her... [chuckles] It's stupid. I told her everyone calls me Private Okra.
Okay. But your dad, right? He was in. You could talk to him. He gets it.
He went AWOL when I was six.
That burn you up?
No. No, I was too young.
All I remember is, uh, the day he left... he told me he was going to get a Coke, and then just never came back. [chuckles]
he told me he was going to get a Coke, and then just never came back. [chuckles]
So now I only drink Pepsi out of spite. [sighs]
What's on your mind, Ocre?
I was just, uh, thinking about this place they're sending us.
-Baqubah. -Yeah.
You know, these small towns, we don't control them.
Yeah, it's not all Yahtzee and flip-flops like it is here.
And... you know, we destroyed their water supply, so they're not gonna be happy to see us.
Yeah, but they will be when we get that water flowing again.
Right. Right.
I just think that there's a chance we're walking into something bigger.
I don't think I'm cut out for that shit.
Burton's tough as nails, and Chutsky isn't afraid of anything. I... I'm--
Look, Chutsky sees a fire, he sticks his hand in it.
I need somebody smart, somebody who sees the bigger picture.
And if I don't go?
If you don't go, then I was wrong about you.
And I don't want anybody I was wrong about watching my back.
It's up to you. You can't come out here and outsource your decision to me.
If you're in, here's the sat phone. You got a call to make.
You ain't gotta look good. Just gotta do good, right?
[Chutsky] Shit. Looking good's the most important part.
He's strange.
Okay, where the fuck are your plates, Private?
-There's not enough to go around. -But... Somebody cough up a plate.
Here, take one of mine.
No, Burton, you're top gun. That's not... Fuck. Chutsky.
-Hey, Sergeant, I'm good-- -Just shut the fuck up, Ocre.
So you gotta ask yourself,
"Am I more likely to get shot in the chest or the back?"
Choose wisely.
[Harper] Okay, kit up. Downstairs in 20 minutes.
-[Burton] Yes, Sergeant! -[Enzo] Hold up.
-Morning. -Morning, Lieutenant.
Morning.
The tank. Fasi, the driver.
Salaam. Sergeant Harper.
IED attacks up and down the way, so maintain convoy integrity.
-Roger that. -No vehicles in or out.
Money in the back. And that's it. Load it up!
Get on it.
Oh. Enjoy Syverson. He's a blast.
[Chutsky] Holy shit!
All right, look. Hide this up your asshole, I will split it with you.
Y'all wanna maintain 10 to 15 meters at all times. Thank you.
Enzo! Mount up.
Dad's coming. Missed out on the fucking money, Ocre.
[Chutsky] We could've been rich, Ocre!
Hey, Sy. Convoy's pulled up.
Give me a moment, gentlemen.
-Hey. Get that water flowing. -[Harper] What?
Get that water flowing.
I say get back! Get back! Let's go! Let's go!
Get back!
Burton, get those fuckers off that truck! Chutsky, come on!
God fucking damn it!
-[Enzo] Get the fuck off the truck! -[Chutsky] Get back!
-[Enzo] Get off the truck. -[Harper] Get the fuck back!
Ocre! Ocre! -I want these people back! -I know. Yes, Sergeant.
-Stay down! -Get off the fucking truck!
Get off! Stay there, okay?
Let this kid through. Let this woman through.
Women and children first! Stay back!
-Get the fuck down! -[woman] No!
Hey. No, get back! Chutsky, you okay?
Hey! Hey! Hey! Stay the fuck back!
All right, guys, your job is real simple.
You keep that water flowing, win their hearts and minds,
and then the Iraqis start pointing fingers and giving me and the boys some targets to hit.
[Machmoud] Captain.
-Machmoud. -You got my 20?
This is Machmoud. These boys are gonna fix your water problem.
Are there more? Yeah, isn't that a daisy?
Go on. Get.
But I want my 20, okay? Dollars, not dinars.
How about I pay you in freedom and democracy?
Taught that guy Texas Hold'em. Do not play him.
Turns out he's a goddamn prodigy. Come on.
This one's me.
Have you guys had much contact with the tribal leader?
Sheikh's a waste of time. You ladies are in here.
Make no mistake, no one outside that gate wants you here.
So you do your job and turn those roars to a whisper.
At night, we go dark.
Snipers so much as see a bit of light, they will start popping shots.
Lovely. Who wants the bunk by the window?
Ocre. You're up top.
Mission is water distro.
Order of movement, three vehicles, two mil, one tanker.
Vehicle number one, tanker. Number two.
Your route is as follows.
We are here. Pumping station is here.
Distro points here, here, and here. Hit as many as you can.
Wheels up in five mikes. Any questions? No, sir.
All right. Let's go to work.
Roger that.
Come on, mount up.
Hey. "A" positive. Me too.
How you doing? You good?
Yeah.
[Harper] Okay.
Enzo, we're pulling out. Chutsky, we're moving.
[Harper] How you doing? Civil Affairs said to fill this up.
Roger that.
[Harper sighs] What the fuck, Sergeant?
Command said it's gonna take a couple of days.
[Robinson scoffs] Command says lots of things,
but I'm standing here telling you two weeks for electrical and four for the pipes.
[Harper] Jesus.
I got 12 guys working in shifts. Half on guard duty, half on the pump.
We have to clear the debris before we can assess the extent of the damage to the pipes.
You wanna go faster, roll up your sleeves. Yeah, well, we're only here to distribute the water, so...
But, hey, I got good news.
We're gonna get you some workers, and we're gonna speed this up.
You got more guys on the way?
Yeah, we'll get some Iraqis. We got cash to spend.
-That's the plan? -That's the plan.
-Pay Iraqis to work? -Yeah.
You got a better plan, Sergeant?
You get me a couple dozen, it might cut your time in half.
-Good. Done. -[Chutsky] Turn it up!
No, all the way up!
It's taking forever.
That's as good as it gets.
Well, can't you engineer, brain something up to make it go faster?
No.
All right, so hour each way. How long does it take to fill this thing?
[Robinson] I'd say 45, give or take.
Three hours a trip.
Plus distribution time.
But the Iraqis line up fast. Should get their water fast.
Okay, so four hours and three trips a day.
I mean, we're still gonna be pushing sunset to be safe.
We got a pickup truck, six o'clock!
Okay, Enzo, Burton, I don't want this guy getting in my convoy.
You understand?
Enzo, this guy's gonna try to pass!
Motherfucker!
Get the fuck back!
Chutsky! This thing breaks, I want you descending on this guy.
Hold tight.
I'm gonna fucking shoot! I'm gonna take a fucking shot, man!
-Get the fuck outta here! -[gunshot]
[Harper] God damn it. Coming in.
Let's go!
[Chutsky] Show me your hands! Show me your hands!
Get out of the car! Get out of the car!
Machmoud, where the fuck are you? Machmoud!
Get out of the car!
[Harper] Ocre, what the fuck are you doing?
Ocre, when I say get out the fuckin' vehicle,
-it means get out the fuckin' vehicle. -I got stuck, Sergeant.
[Chutsky] That's a smart move. That's... that's way safer, Ocre.
Ocre, search him.
-Let's go, Ocre! -[Chutsky] What is he saying?
[Chutsky] Machmoud, what the fuck is he saying?
-He says his daughter is with him. -His daughter?
Hey. Hey, there's a little girl back here.
-[Chutsky] She armed? -No. No, I don't think so.
[Harper] All right, Enzo, check the back.
[in English] He's saying his girl is sick
and he's taking her to a relative who has an apothecary.
-A what? -An apothecary.
A pharmacy.
-Hi, honey. -[man speaking Arabic] [Harper] Can you step out of the vehicle for me?
[Matt] Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
Hi. I want you... I want you to stand right there
-for me, okay? -It's okay. She's okay.
[Chutsky] Check his legs.
[Machmoud] He say he has nothing.
[Harper] Enzo?
-[Enzo] Nothing back here, Sergeant. -The truck's clear.
-Clear, Sergeant. -[Harper] Yeah, we're good. Enzo?
[Enzo] Clear, Sergeant.
Okay, you can step back in your car now.
Chutsky, come here.
Look, these... these people, they use kids as cover all the time.
[stammers] I think we arrest him, we let the SF guys handle him.
I got a bad feeling about this guy.
Okay. Ocre, cut him loose. Let's go, cut him loose.
Look, this is, uh... this is for your trouble and your little girl there, okay?
We're sorry for the trouble.
Okay, but hey, hey, hey. You can't drive this road anymore, okay?
I don't wanna see you on this road. Machmoud, tell him.
-What'd he say? -He doesn't want the money.
Enzo, get the door.
[Chutsky] Who the fuck doesn't want money?
[Harper] All right, let's go. Come on. Let's go.
Ocre. Ocre. You need an invitation? Come on.
Move your fuckin' ass. Let's go.
We will be distributing water at this location every day at 10:00 a.m.
Now, our engineers are working very hard to get your pump station fixed,
and we're very sorry about it. We're gonna get your water flowing again.
But we need help. We need workers.
And we are going to be paying each man.
We're willing to pay him in cash for a ten-hour work day.
Okay, move it along. This guy is next. Come through.
And we're gonna be here tomorrow at sunrise.
We're gonna transfer every willing worker to the pump station. -[speaking Arabic] -Get the fuck back. All right.
-[speaking Arabic] -Get the fuck back. All right.
Help us help you.
Thank you.
[Enzo] Gimme a straight line! All right. Men over here, women over here.
That's how we do it in America. That's how we're gonna do it here.
Gimme more children. All the children up here.
Get the fuck back. I'm not gonna tell you again.
Hey. Hey, no, you weren't next! You weren't next. This guy's next.
Join the line. Okay, you're good. Move on out.
All of you guys... All right, fine.
Okay, you're next. Thank you, sir.
Calm down. Keep it back. Keep it back.
-Enzo, help out, will you? -Back it up. Back it up.
-Next in line, here we go. -[clamoring continues]
Hey, easy. Get back.
[Matt] Here you go, sir.
Please, keep back, sir. Back in the line.
Okay.
Okay. Let's go. Back them up.
Okay, let this guy through. He's good.
You guys go around and join the line. Go around and join the line.
I'm serving people who've been waiting first, okay?
Oh, yeah, that's good.
[man] Let's get some sleep.
[man 1] Rodriguez, I got you a movie!
[man 2] Keep your hands off of me. [man 1] I'll be thinking of you!
Well, so much for our local labor. -Where the fuck is everybody at, Sergeant? -[Chutsky] Fuckin' lazy is what they are.
-Where the fuck is everybody at, Sergeant? -[Chutsky] Fuckin' lazy is what they are.
I got a bull's-eye on me the longer we stay here.
Request we move this shit along.
All right, we're not gonna wait any longer. Let's go. Mount up.
Machmoud, come on.
Ocre.
How we looking?
Like halfway.
Harper, where are my Iraqis?
Uh, they didn't show, but... but I'm working on it.
In fact, the captain and I have a meeting with the sheikh later. What about you? Any progress?
[Robinson] My team's trying to figure out this system.
Half the parts they don't make anymore. Shit sandwich, huh?
We'll do our job. Just get me some labor.
[Harper] Will do.
Sheikh's only ever talked to me, so I'll make the introduction.
Take your boots off when you get inside.
Have some chai. And after chai, get down to business.
He... he don't like that you bring more soldiers to his home.
These soldiers are gonna give water to your people.
[Harper] Sheikh.
We want the inclusion of your people, okay?
We want them to work alongside us to help fix the problem that we caused.
[Harper] And with your blessing, Sheikh,
your people will help us, and get y'all's water working again.
[Machmoud in English] He say this is very dangerous.
If he helps the Americans, he will pay with his life.
Him and his people. Yeah, we're gonna keep everybody protected, okay?
The captain and... and his men, they're gonna keep everybody safe.
He say Baqubah is two different cities.
One during the day belongs to the US, and one at night belongs to other people.
Uh, he say his people do not trust the Americans.
When the night comes, you cannot protect.
Tell him...
I understand your fear. I do.
But if we don't have help, there's not gonna be any water.
No water. Tell him, Machmoud. No water.
[Machmoud in English] He say you destroyed the water, you fix it. It's your problem.
Hello. Welcome. Hello. You deliver water?
Uh, yeah, we'll be back tomorrow. Bring some containers.
Oh, we have tanks in the school.
[stammering] We have children, many people.
We don't need too much. But we need water.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll see what I can do.
Thank you. I'm Kadeer. I'm the director of the school.
Kadeer, I'm Matt. It's good to meet you.
-Thank you. Thank you, sir. -Have a good day.
We're gonna pay, okay? We have money. We will pay. Do you understand?
[in English] He say you don't understand him or his people.
Uh, the US come here and say they help. But when you leave, what will happen?
Okay. Right. We... I want you to be real clear about this.
We will not leave. We will not leave until the problem is solved.
[in English] He say those people you say are bad will not hurt us unless we help the Americans.
[in English] He wants us to leave.
Listen here, you piece of shit. I hope you get shot and fuckin' die.
-[Machmoud] Uh... -Don't translate that.
Thank you for your time, Sheikh.
[Enzo] So let me get this straight. Now we're doing the Iraqis' work?
[Chutsky] Yeah. But, we, uh... We get the Iraqis' money, right?
You don't do this shit for free.
[Enzo] Right, Sergeant Harper?
See how the soil won't clot?
No water means it can't form. If it can't form, it can't be fertile.
Even before you guys came here, Sunni farmers in the north
would steal the water from the Shiites in Baqubah.
How'd you stop it from happening?
-We don't. It's not about the water. -[Harper] Chutsky! It's full. Let's go.
It's the Sunnis and the Shiites.
They will always find an excuse to kill each other.
So it's definitely a thing.
-Yo, Chutsky. -[Chutsky] Yes.
[Chutsky] Oh, thanks, Ocre.
-[Matt] Is it in this country? -[Chutsky] Yes.
-Is it in all countries? -[Chutsky] Yes.
[Matt] Is it on you right now? Are you carrying it?
[Chutsky] Yup. We all carry it.
We all carry it?
[Burton] Contact, three o'clock! Contact, three o'clock! High, 50 meters!
Keep moving! Keep moving! Keep moving!
Move through! Move through!
Damn it.
Eagle Six, this is Eagle Four. We're FUBAR behind this goddamn truck!
Everybody out! Dispatch!
Cease fire! Cease fire.
Chutsky, H report.
-I got two mags, .600 link. Up, up. -Roger that.
Ocre, H report.
Yeah, I'm two. Up, up.
-[Harper] Roger that. Machmoud, you good? -[Machmoud] Fine, sir.
[Harper] Eagle Four, this is Eagle Six. Gimme a status report.
[Enzo on radio] This is Eagle Four. We got six mags, several hundred .556. Up, up.
[Harper] Okay, roger that. Chutsky, stay in the gun. Ocre?
-Yeah. -On me.
Hey, Sergeant.
[Chutsky] Fuck this, man.
Fuckin' Iraqi in the truck. I told you we should've arrested him.
Yeah, I'll be sure to put your complaint in my sitrep, okay, Sergeant? Thank you.
Fuck it. Fuck it.
Fuck it. I'm tired of this shit.
I don't give a fuck anymore. This is bullshit. I'm taking a shower.
[Enzo] Burton!
-You in on this? -No. I'm good.
All right, this is happening.
-[Enzo] Whoo! -I'm glad I'm not even watching you guys.
-[Enzo] Oh, yeah! Oh, that's good. -[Chutsky] Oh, yeah.
Let's go. Get back to your posts. You're good and clean.
Sir, I need someone to loofah my back, sir. [Enzo] Oh! Oh, yeah. Whoo!
[Enzo] Hey!
[Chutsky] Fuck.
This is bullshit. There's a whole village on the other side of that hill.
We're sitting here scabbing our hands like fuckin' chumps.
Don't worry, assholes! We got it!
They're just scared.
What is that, some kinda fuckin' excuse?
-We're all fuckin' scared, Ocre. -Yeah, well, give it time.
You know what? You need to crawl out from behind your faggotty little rainbow.
All right? We sit here all day, breaking our backs gettin' these fuckers water.
And we turn around, they're fuckin' shooting at us.
I know a loaded deck when I see one.
Get to show his neck?
-[in English] Just say "one by one." -[Matt] But how do you say it?
-Have a good day. Salaam. -Salaam.
Call it out!
-Oh, shit! -[Harper] Call it out!
-Jesus! Fuck! -Where's it coming from?
Call it out! What do you see? Chutsky, gimme a report.
It's coming from everywhere! We're gettin' fuckin' lit up. Jesus!
[Enzo] Don't move! Stay the fuck down!
Burton, foreign rooftop! 15 meters, your 12!
[Burton] I got you. All right, we're getting tagged from all sides.
Burton, get up on the truck!
[Harper] Warhorse, Warhorse, this is Eagle Six.
We are in contact in the city square.
Do you copy? Warhorse?
We got rooftop, twelve o'clock!
Shit. [grunts]
-Okay. Okay. -[Enzo] There he is.
At the city-- Fuck.
Enzo!
-[Harper] Enzo! -I'm here, Sarge! I'm set!
[Harper] Fuck, I'm dry.
Fuck, I need a mag! I need a mag!
Shit.
-[Matt] See anything? -[Chutsky] Nah. He's up there. I'm waiting for a fuckin' head.
Go, go, go!
Fuck!
-Get moving! -You got him?
-Not yet. There's at least two up there. -Okay.
-Ready to rock? Let's light 'em up. -Yeah.
-Keep his head down! -Yeah.
Fuck! Chutsky, wait!
Chutsky!
Chutsky!
Hey! Hey, Chutsky, you okay?
Guys, Chutsky... Chutsky's down, guys!
You think, um... you think his family knows yet?
I ain't running that dirt road again.
That thing is death on a fucking stick.
Tell me I'm wrong.
We're making progress.
[Enzo] At a goddamn snail's pace, Sergeant.
Tell him, Burton.
Tell him what you said to me.
Forget it.
Speak the fuck up and tell him what you said to me.
-Please, man. Come on! -[Harper] Go on, Sergeant.
It's okay. Speak freely.
That we have a job to do and we'll do it.
But if we stay on this course, we'll get picked off one by one.
[Enzo] So I say we about face the fuck up out of here before I'm folding your shit in a box.
Why don't we just go out and shoot 'em?
I wouldn't mind putting some bullets in those motherfuckers.
Nope, guys. That's not our job, okay? That's not... We are here to help these people.
Those assholes don't want our help.
-Why the hell should we give it to 'em? -Yeah. The mission's a loser.
Even Machmoud knows it.
He said they were fighting over the water before we got here.
If we put it back to normal, that's just what normal is.
Okay, guys, you got tonight.
Okay? You get a whole fuckin' night to be sad or angry
or whatever the fuck you need to secure your shit.
And tomorrow we're punching back in.
We're going back to work.
[guard] Ocre! Someone here for you.
Mr. Matt!
Mr. Matt, I'm sorry for what happened to your friend.
Uh, why are you here?
-You say you bring water to the school. -I said I'd try.
That got fucked up yesterday though, didn't it?
Mr. Matt, with no water, the school will close. There are people there.
It's a community center, not only for children.
That's great. Just stop shooting at us.
We... we don't shoot. Not the people at the school.
We want the same thing as you do.
Really? What?
We want clean water. And for you to go home.
We've been trying. No one will help us.
Maybe you are asking the wrong people. Mr. Matt! Mr. Matt!
I don't get it. You're gonna have to talk me through this.
[Harper] We've been given money and told to use it to get local labor.
I've done this before. You talk to the guy in charge, and that's the sheikh.
And he's been very clear that the locals will not work with us.
Well, that's exactly why we need somebody who's gonna do what the sheikh won't.
And you think a schoolteacher is the answer?
All due respect, sir, we're down a tanker and we lost a man yesterday.
I gotta activate these guys.
Okay? And we can't do this on our own. I'm just... I'm requesting you hear the private out.
Fine.
Private?
Sir, I'm... I'm gonna be honest. I... I haven't really formulated a plan, but...
You know, nothing we've tried is working.
This man... seems to have a legitimate reason to wanna work with us.
So maybe we could use that as an opportunity to reach out to the community.
What makes you think we can trust this guy?
I think if Sergeant Harper and I go to the school, perhaps we can figure something out, sir.
Just don't fuck this up.
Roger that, sir.
Is that all?
Uh, yeah, yeah. Unfortunately, without the tanker, that's the best we can do.
I understand.
Thank you.
Very grateful. Thank you.
Kadeer, um, you said we were talking to the wrong people.
Could you explain to the people here what we're doing, why we're here?
-They know. -Yeah, but they won't help.
Working with the Americans is very dangerous.
How can you guarantee their safety?
[Matt] Well, they won't be seen collaborating with us. Everything goes through you.
You talk to them. You bring them to the pumping station.
Nobody has to know.
Look, it's your terms, okay?
You bring us the workers, we give the water at the pumping station.
And look, we're gonna pay them in cash. And you.
Uh, I don't need the money. The money is for the school.
I will try. I will speak with them.
Hey, Machmoud.
[soldier on radio] Sergeant Harper, main gate. Looks like your hajjis are here.
Could you come down and verify, please? Over.
Yeah, we'll be right down.
You wanted workers? You got workers.
-[men shouting indistinctly] -[soldier] What's in the bag? Hey, hey. Step away from the bag.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, calm down.
-Step away from the bag. -[Matt] Kadeer.
-[Kadeer] Mr. Matt! Mr. Matt. -My name is Sergeant Harper.
I need everybody to calm... I need everybody quiet.
[soldier] He's got this bag. I... It's suspicious. There's precision tools in there. I don't like the looks of it.
There's precision tools in there. I don't like the looks of it. Kadeer. Kadeer, please tell... This is your brother?
Kadeer. Kadeer, please tell... This is your brother?
Yes, Mr. Harper. My brother is an engineer.
Here... here he... He is here to help you.
Okay. Uh, we're gonna need your brother to show my private the contents of that bag.
-I'm sorry. It's procedure. -Please.
-There's no disrespect. -Please.
[soldier] Nice and slow.
Okay. Okay. Perfect.
Perfect.
Yeah. Can you move this? Move this.
-[Harper] Okay. -Okay, that's great. It's clean.
All right, everybody... everybody, calm down.
-Thank you. -Please put the bag on the ground.
Machmoud, tell him to get to the back of the line.
-You're still gonna be patted down. -[speaking Arabic]
Corporal, I want you to start patting guys down.
-Ocre, help Corporal. -Yep.
Private, I want you to search that car right now. Thoroughly. Thank you.
Please step up right here.
Machmoud, come on. -Come on, Machmoud. -[speaking Arabic]
[in English] He said they stopped manufacturing this piece.
I know that. Can he fix it?
[in English] He can't.
[in English] He can make a new one.
-How long does he need? -[in English] Uh, two or three days.
Great. Have at it.
So you, um... you speak English too?
Yes.
How... how'd you learn all that stuff?
Here, in University of Mosul.
-Ah. -Mechanical engineering.
You go to university?
No. No, no, no, it was too expensive.
You have to pay to study? It's not free?
Yeah.
-What, it's free here? -Of course.
Shit. Well, in America nothing's free.
Aika. Hey. [kisses air]
Hey, baby.
Here, man. Spray her for me.
Huh. Okay. Hey, why do you paint her green?
Strays around here, wild and pissed off. People shoot 'em on sight.
Green dog, that's a good dog.
Anyone shoots a green dog, they answer to me.
Any tips?
Yeah, just don't get it in her eyes.
-Hey, you said her name's Aika? -Aika.
Hey, Aika.
Hey.
Robinson said we should be done in a week.
Yup. Can't come soon enough.
All I'm looking forward to...
is getting back home to the Frisky Kitty Buffet.
-Hmm? Getting me a-- -[Burton] Who do you wanna see?
Who you wanna see?
-Mercedes. -Mercedes, baby.
You know why. 'Cause how we like 'em, Burton?
-[both exclaim] We like 'em thick! -[Matt chuckles]
What are you eating?
MRE. This is, uh... penne and vegetable.
-It's good? -Yeah, you want some?
No. You try chicken pilaf?
-Yeah, man. -Chicken and rice.
-Do you want it? -No, no.
-Try some chicken. -Okay. Here, taste.
My wife, she made this.
-Uh-uh, Sarge. -It's not chicken.
-Don't do it. -How many chickens do you see out here?
-Here, you try it first. -I'm good. I'm full.
I got lasagna and... Oof!
-[Enzo] Don't do it. -[Burton] Uh-uh.
That's fuckin' amazing. [chuckles] My compliments to your wife.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
Nah, I'm joking. [Enzo chuckles] Yeah, I told you he would, man.
You sure you don't want some of my penne? No, really, it's... No.
Smart man.
-Yeah. -[indistinct chatter]
-I wanna be serious, all right? -Say it.
This is for...
This is for fuckin'... This is for fuckin' Chutsky, man.
-Chutsky, baby. -Chutsky.
-Okay? R-I-P. -[Burton] Miss that motherfucker.
-He loved this music. [laughs] -He did not fucking love this music.
[Matt] He fuckin' only listened to country music.
[Burton] He's good. No, he's good for it.
Okay, where the fuck is Kadeer and these guys?
[Harper] Okay, Enzo, Burton, full security.
Machmoud, come here.
-Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. -[woman lamenting and speaking Arabic]
[Harper] We got... we got a situation here.
You're gonna have to get higher on the horn, okay? Out. Copy.
The downtown market here is where they are based.
They meet at night.
The flower shop here... is where I think they hide their weapons.
I know the place. Thank you. And we're sorry for your loss.
I don't need your thanks.
BJ, would you, uh, escort this gentleman out, please?
Harper, Ocre.
Do you guys think this info is credible?
Should see what they did to this guy's brother.
He's got every reason to want to help us.
Pepps?
[sighs] Seems like too good an opportunity to pass.
Okay. Well, this intel's only gonna last so long before it goes bad,
so we got to move.
My guess, we can take two teams. I'll lead Alpha on the back.
I'll take Bravo and make entry, hold the front.
I can get the guys in there,
but we don't have enough vehicles to block the street, so...
-we're gonna be needin' your help. -Yeah, roger that.
Good. Full brief in about an hour.
[Harper] I know. I've... I heard you, Anne.
Anne, I... Look, will you just... will you say it?
-Shit, sorry. I'll come back. -No, man, [stammers] you're good.
Will you just say it even if you don't mean it, Anne? Just say it.
No, never mind.
Okay, Anne.
[chuckles] You take care too.
Hey, phone's free if you want.
[smacks lips] You good?
Yup. Yeah. Yup.
Hey, bro, you know, we're finally gonna get a chance to get these guys.
Then we can finish the pump station, fix it, go home.
[softly] Yeah.
"There's a bullet out there for everyone...
with their names written small on the side.
Mine is coming." [chuckles]
No, my dad used to say that.
That's comforting.
But it is, if you think about it.
You know, maybe... maybe my bullet's waiting out there.
Or maybe my bullet is cancer. Gonna hit me 50 years from now.
Oh, but that's not up to me.
So why worry?
Sure you're up for this, huh?
Yeah.
-[Burton] Are you good? -[Enzo] Hell no, I ain't good.
This is war, baby.
I'm just fuckin' scared, man. My hands shaking and shit, like...
-Now look at me. Look at me. -...a little bitch.
Now you drive this motherfucker.
And I shoot anything that gets in the way.
You understand me?
You keep me safe up there.
[scoffs] You know it. Come on.
Hey, James.
Your boys good?
[Harper] Yes, sir.
[Syverson] All right. Let's do this.
-Mount up. -[Harper] Roger that.
Hey, Ocre, I want you on twelve and three. Roger.
Eagle Six, this is Eagle Four. Blocking position three is set.

[Harper] No, I got the six. Stay on three! Stay on three!
[Matt] Roger! Roger!

Blocking positions two and three taking heavy sniper fire. Copy?
[Pepps] Standby, Eagle Six. On the move.
-Load 'em in. Load 'em in. [Harper] Roger that.
-[Pepps] Let's go, pack it in. -[Syverson] It's hoods.
Back to Warhorse, back to Warhorse. I say again, RTB, RTB.
Roger. Copy. Returning to base. Eagle Four, we are on the move.

Sergeant, they're hit! Move! Go back! They're hit! move!
-Get back, get back. -[Enzo] Oh, shit.

[Matt] Fuck, Sergeant, I'm out!
-[Enzo] Come on, baby! -[Matt] Cover fire!
[Enzo] Come on!

-Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. -[Harper] Get him in!
I got him! Enzo, you're good! You're good! You're good!
Come on, let's go! Move, move, move, move! Come on, get him in the car!
Get in the car!
You gotta help me get him in!
-[Harper] You gotta get him in! -Help me get him in, Enzo!
Come on, come on!
Ocre, get in!
-Go! -[Matt] Get in, Sergeant! Let's go!
Go! Get the fuck in!
Go! Go!
Move! Move! Move! Move!
[Enzo] Baby, you're gonna be all right, okay?
All right? Yeah, that's right. Breathe. Come on, baby, breathe. Breathe.
You got it. Fuck is he?
Sarge is gonna get us there real quick, okay?
Sarge, you gotta hurry the fuck up. You gotta hurry up, please!
He's my friend. He's my fuckin' friend, man.
Is he breathing?
I don't fuckin' know, man. He's hurt pretty fuckin' bad.
He's hurt bad.
All right, just breathe. Just breathe. Come on.

You'll be good, baby, all right? Just breathe. Just breathe. Come on.
Sarge, he's not look... he's not looking too good, all right? He's not looking too good.
[office on radio] Eagle Six, you are directed to go back
to your operating frequency of two-zero-eight-zero-zero in the red.
Medevac is two mikes out.
[man] Get a stretcher over here! Cowboy comin' in hot!
-Come on. Let's go. Get him up. -We got you. We got you.
[Enzo groaning] Ah, fuck, man!
Okay, let's go! Move!
-Hey, Pat, you all right? -Yeah.
Lay him down. Lay him down. -Right here. Right here. -Wait, wait, wait!
[Harper] He's gonna be fine.
-[Enzo] Hey, man. -You're gonna be fine, Burton.
[Enzo] You need to wake up, man.
-What have we got? -Both wounded!
One stable, one critical!
-All right. Get ready to move! -Get him up!
-[Enzo] I'm going with him. -One, two, three.
I'm going with him, man. Come on. Take me with him.
[man] You all right? I got you. I got you.
[Harper] It's gonna be okay! Let's go. Get up!
We're gonna see you at base, okay?
-We'll see you at base! -[Enzo] I'm sorry, Sergeant Harper.
-Enzo, you're all right. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[Matt] We'll see you soon, Enzo.
[Harper] You just watch Burton!

You fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
-[grunting] -[Harper] No! No! Ocre!
No, man. No, man. It's not like that, man. Not like that!
[Syverson] Hey! Wake the fuck up! Wake up!
Not like that, man!
It's okay. He's okay.
-[Matt grunting] -Just don't be like that.
Just don't be like that.
It's not gonna be like that.
Well... a rough night, but it was not for nothing.
Arif, your wife make the, uh, tagine?
-What? -The chicken.
Uh, not today.
I wonder what's he's got. [grunts] 'Cause I am fucking sick of the penne.
All right.
[Robinson] Hey, where are you going?
-Hey. -[Harper] We got spaghetti and meat--
-[Harper] What do we do? -[Syverson] You okay?
[Harper into radio] We've suffered an IED attack at the northeast pump station.
There are multiple casualties.
Requesting immediate medevac and immediate reinforcements.
Say again. This is Eagle Six.
We have suffered an IED attack at the pump station, northeast.
We're requesting immediate...
Ocre!
You all right, man? Yeah?
Yeah? Go sit down, man.
[officer on radio] Warhorse. Nine lives. Follows. Break.
Line one. Papa-Yankee- five-four-three-niner.
Four-five-niner-one.
-[distorted] I say again... -[groans]
It can be beautiful.
Can't it?
-How you men feeling? -[Matt and Harper] Good, Sergeant Major.
Attention.
At ease.
Sergeant Harper...
Three weeks' leave to return with us in Riyadh.
Roger, sir.
Private Ocre.
What do you say we get you back on level ground?
There's a convoy leaving at 1400.
It'll take you to the Balad flightline
and a C-130 will take you back to the States.
I'm happy to waive my leave, sir. If it's all the same, I'll stay.
The lieutenant is not giving you leave, son.
You're going home, Private.
Sergeant Major, there is no reason to be concerned about--
Your war is over.
[stammers] No, it isn't over.
-The war isn't over-- -Excuse me?
With all due respect, what happened in Baqubah--
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Yeah.
As the NCO in charge of Private Ocre, it is my opinion
that he has nothing more to prove to himself or to anybody else.
-It's not about proving anything-- -Ocre. Ocre.
-It's time to go home, Matt. -No.
-This is the time when we are-- -Take it easy there, son.
Sergeant Major, I think we need to talk about what happened,
and then maybe we can fix it.
Your job is done here!
How?
No, please, someone tell me how my fuckin' job is done here,
-because I don't see how it's-- -God damn it, Private!
You're dismissed.
[Harper] What, you a smoker now?
They, uh, made me see the chaplain.
What'd he say?
It's, uh, God's plan.
Then he asked if I smoke. I said no.
So, uh, he gives me these and said maybe I should consider starting.
How about you? What you thinking about?
What am I thinking about? Uh...
I'm thinking about a Royals game.
A Royals game...
a Tecate...
and garlic fries.
-Ooh, garlic fries. -Yup.
I start thinking about that, and all this other shit starts rushing back, you know?
I haven't even thought about home for a long time.
Did I tell you some captain told me to blouse my boots today?
Can you believe that shit?
Some dude fresh off the boat,
hasn't done a damn thing, tells me to blouse my boots and look professional.
I was fucking pissed, not just 'cause of the boot thing, but...
But what?
You know, we fucking had it, Sergeant.
The people were with us. The water was gonna flow.
It wasn't ours to have, Ocre.
-You got nothing to feel guilty about. -No, but--
Okay? For whatever you did or whatever you didn't do.
No, I...
I broke my own hand back in Kuwait. I slammed it in a Hummer door.
Just... trying to get out of all this shit.
Well, now you can.
Hey, you want these?
Nope.
Confusing feeling, ain't it?
All we do is think about going home...
Now, here it is.
I don't feel anything, Sergeant Major.
Yeah, it takes a while before it kicks in.
But it'll catch up. Believe me.
[takes deep breath] Good luck, son.
Hey, Sergeant Major?
Beautiful day for the infantry?
Beautiful day, son.
Beautiful goddamn day.
All right.
Better get a move on. Gonna miss your flight.
Yeah.
I'll see ya on the other side of the berm.
I'm not promising we can repair it, but if we don't try,
Leo will never be able to talk.
Your son deserves that we do our best.
I understand you have your own beliefs,
but sometimes the good Lord does his best work through human hands.
[Leo's mother] No.
[in German] Come, my child, help me.
He'll be fine.
We just need to get him home.
God will heal Leo.
[woman on PA] ...you are not just a customer, you are part of the machine.
[man on PA] If you see acts of graffiti being committed,
please notify the authorities.
All American military personnel must have valid passes.
[Naadirah] Leo!
Hi!
I'm so sorry.
I'm late.
So sorry.
Yeah, let's go.
Leo, I got something for you.
Well, you have to wait.
Come on. I'm starving.
[automated voice] Please watch your heads. FlyMeal coming through.
You really don't mind eating this again?
It's comfort food, you know?
Here. [clears throat]
Don't get me wrong. I really love your very...
peculiar way of living, but...
it would make things so much easier.
It's the oldest, simplest phone I could find.
So that's where you... Wait, let me show it to you.
So... Okay, that's how you turn it on, and...
[chuckles] What?
Leo, stop hiding.
You are so beautiful.
Da stargo tora.
The black of my eyes.
Means "the thing that makes me feel beautiful."
-Hi! -Hi.
One more?
That's a real sexy hood ornament you got dancing up there tonight.
Upstairs.
I need two more of those.
That's my favorite so far.
But it's too easy.
Make me a sea horse.
-[Rob] Here you are, mate. Here she comes. -Come on, love.
-Thank you. -Thank you very much.
Ladies.
[Rob] Here, love. My man's got a question for you.
I'm wondering if the top matches the bottom.
[Rob] Isn't he charming?
-Just take that. -[Luba] Hey, Naadirah.
-Hey, pretty girl. -[Luba] Naadirah, let's go take a break.
Come on.
-She loves it. -Loves it.
So, did Nicky talk to you?
-Yeah. -How much money you have saved so far?
-Not enough. -And why isn't he helping?
He doesn't know. Luba, get off the car.
What? He doesn't know?
Wow! Mute and dumb. What a catch.
You haven't brought him over. I hope it's got nothing to do with me.
Luba.
You can put a sock on the door handle so I know not to come in.
Or wait till I'm asleep. I know he'll be quiet.
Stop.
Why the hell can't he talk anyway?
It's complicated.
It's his mother's fault.
He needs surgery. It's against her beliefs.
If my mom tried to stop me talking, I would fuck her up.
-And she's in a wheelchair. -[laughs]
He doesn't need words.
He's kind.
Why wouldn't I love him?
Love?
Yeah.
I didn't do that?
-[clicks tongue] Aw, Luba... -No.
-I'm gonna go back inside. -Wait, wait. So who did Nicky suggest?
Oswald.
It doesn't matter how close you rub up against Grace, Luba,
you will never be as beautiful as her.
-Get off my car. -Okay.
-Back to work. Let's go. -Fine.
Blue is my favorite lollipop color. I just lick 'em like...
You know what I think?
Maybe I didn't offer enough money.
-Get your hands off me. -This goes easier if you don't fight--
-Get your hands off me. -Who do you think... Hey!
What you doing? Hey! Rob! Rob!
-What you doing? Hey! -It's all right. Leave him be.
-I didn't know she was your woman. -Leave him be.
Get your hands off him!
-You all right? -Yeah, he took my money, man.
-Fucking thief. -[Rob] Never put your hands on me.
-This is expensive shit. -It's not worth it.
Leo. Leo.
Leo!
I can't lose this job.
[Toby] Yeah, listen to your bitch, Leo.
[Rob] Yeah, go on. Keep walking, lanky prick.
[Toby] Yeah, get out, man.
Fucker.
[Toby] Hey, don't push me!
[automated voice] Welcome. Please take your seats and fasten your seat belts.
[Toby] Yeah? That's what your mom liked.
Hello?
Oh, yeah.
All right. All right. Getting it.
Thank you.
Hey, lover boy. Let's go.
[Maksim] I built my dream here, piece by piece.
My car, my club, my security.
Not easy.
If you interfere with what I have made...
One warning.
One.
I don't want to see you in here again.
Something happened tonight.
No. No, I'm not hurt.
But I...
I need to tell you something.
Someone I...
I need to tell you about someone.
But no! No, I'm not leaving you, but I...
I have to tell you something about me.
God, Leo. The last thing I want to do is leave you.
What are you always doodling in there?
A bed?
A bed for us?
Leo, where are we going?
It's freezing cold.
Leo, do you have a car?
It's like it's from a fairy tale.
I don't deserve you, Leo.
I love you.
I love you so much.
I always will.
But you don't know me.
[Duck] Maybe if she saw Josie more, she'd get off your back.
You're down here half the time.
[Cactus] She's my daughter. She stays with me.
[Duck] What does Josie want?
Hold on.
I can't see shit.
You know what? We're gonna have to cut these pants right off.
[Cactus] She's a kid. She does what she's told.
Her mom can kiss my Yankee ass.
[Duck] I'm trying to save this leg.
[Cactus] I'll make it up to Josie when we get back to New York.
Oh, what fun panties.
-[Duck] Club camo? -[Cactus] And they work with the garters.
[Duck] What do you have in here? Are you throwing this out?
[Cactus] Junk. Leave it.
You know, I can see the shell, -I just can't-- -[man groans]
-[Cactus] Yeah, yeah... -[Duck] Easy...
I know. It hurts all over.
[Cactus] Put weight on it.
That, my myopic friend, is a .38.
[Duck] My, my. So it is. You got eyes like a hawk.
Leave those baby blues to me. I'll recycle them.
Checkmate.
-[Cactus] Want to chuck some rock later? -[Duck] Sure do.
Is good?
-[Cactus] He was shot five times? -Gunther... [speaking German]
-Da. Five. -Yeah.
Well, then... is good.
Old slim here's gonna be ready to rob and roll before you know it.
Go on, close him up.
[Duck] An honor and a pleasure, my friend.
-Is this guy family or one of your goons? -Not family.
No. Make the stitches big.
[Akim] No one in my family is stupid enough to get shot five times.
[Cactus] Yeah?
Tell him to get the fuck out of the way the next time,
because I don't plan on sticking around to help him sort out his social life.
So, you leave soon?
I don't know, Akim. Do I?
Boss says two days. Three at most.
[Duck] That sounds like an excuse, babe.
It does, right? I mean, that's an awful lot.
Still, it's gotta be nice, right?
Having a surgeon on call? All private and such?
Well, that is me. Miller time.
How about you, Akim? Want a little drink? Black Russian, maybe?
[laughs] If he say he get you out of country, he get.
It's delicate.
Maksim has to be careful, yes?
He doesn't want trouble from military police.
-You are a-hole. -[laughs]
AWOL. Yeah. See, I'm AWOL. You're a-hole.
Expensive to make American soldier disappear.
Especially now. Lots of work.
But he likes you, Cactus. Relax. Is not going to be problem.
Oh, goody. 'Cause the sooner I am out of this shit stain of a country, the better.
If you hate Germany so much, why are you here?
He joined a fraternity. Wanna-be-a-papa.
Don't be a fuckin' AWOL.
Bag.
[woman on TV] We're trying to keep this as relaxed as possible, Mr. Bell.
You can be seated, you can stand. It really doesn't matter.
[Sam coughs] Um... I'll sit. I'll stand. I mean, I'll sit.
[man 1] Do something, man.
-[Sam] My name is Sam Bell. -[man 2] So is mine! So is mine, pal!
-[man 3] Hey, come on! -[woman] Order!
-[man 3] Come on! -[man 2] It's my name too.
-[woman] Order! -[man 2] Yeah.
[in German] Are you strict?
Amish.
You turned away from the TV.
You're a strict one.
We've all got vices, my friend.
-[man in English on TV] Shut up! -[woman] I understand...
[in German] I watch too much of this shit anyway.
Hey.
Hey!
What does a guy have to do to get service?
There's no table service.
Are you serious?
-There's no table service. You order here. -It's like three fuckin' feet.
Such a...
[panting] Man. All right.
Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna be all right.
I would... Hold on.
Could I get a cappuccino?
Just give me a bonca fucka-fookin'-fuckin' coffee, would you?
You work at Dreams, right?
I heard you got in a fight the other night with some limeys.
Now, I'm not the kind of guy to get between a man and his grudge,
but don't do that again.
I'd really appreciate it.
I need those assholes.
At least for another week.
[laughs] Hey! Mine's bigger than that.
Did you spit in this?
Hey, dummy. What'd you do with Naadirah?
Where is she?
Leo, this is Nicky.
He runs Maksim's business across the street.
He drinks free, all right? What are you having, Nicky?
Two shots, single malt.
Send that and a Stoli up to the office.
[Rob] Two vodkas on the rocks, please, mate?
-Chop, chop. -[Toby] Come on, boy.
No hard feelings about last night. These things happen, all right?
Oh yeah, one more thing, mate.
Where's that little blue-haired waitress from yesterday? Hmm?
'Cause I'd like to give her an apology as well.
I'd like to give her a very big apology.
[Toby] Come here!
[waitress] Hey, stop!
[Maksim] Leo, you're fired.
[Cactus] Cocksucking commie assholes.
It's a good likeness, babe.
You know who drew that?
That fucking barman who beat up my ticket out of here.
God! This place...
No wonder the Krauts keep invading other countries.
If I knew I was stuck here for the rest of time,
I would be blitzkrieging my ass through France too.
You'll make it back to the States. It's gonna be great.
Uh-oh... Someone's awake.
Come here. Say hi to your Uncle Duck.
What are you doing awake? Oh.
Oh, man. What a beautiful babe. You sure she's yours?
[Kanwal] She says she can't sleep.
No? Did you have a nightmare?
-You want some water, honey? -No, I'm gonna stick with beer.
-Bill, I need to take off. -Okay. Here, take a cab.
You need any help with her again, call me.
-Thank you. -Bye, Josie. See you soon.
Hey, you did great tonight. Thanks, Kanwal.
Bye.
Bye.
-She work at the club? -She works at the parlor. -Oh. -[Cactus] Sweet kid.
What do you say we take you upstairs?
I'll read you a story. Come on. I'll tuck you in.
By the way, what happened downstairs...
The little word game, "Wanna-be-a-papa"?
Don't do that again. I'll hurt you.
I was just playing, babe.
Hmm. And don't shtup our babysitter.
That'd be weird, right?
[automated voice] Volkea Reward credits are still available
for customers reporting the whereabouts of US service personnel
absent without leave.
Don't be shy. Screw that guy.
[woman on speaker in German] What do you want?
Don't know her.
You've got the wrong place.
[in German] Follow me, love.
[in English] You?
Get out. You're going to get me in trouble.
If you haven't found her, it's probably because she's finally dumped you,
you useless shit.
Or...
or...
maybe you're here for me.
Yeah. That's right.
Oh, what? What? Are you judging me now? You fucking tech-tard!
-[Akim] Hey, Luba! -Do you think your girlfriend's a saint?
You think your girlfriend's a saint, don't you?
-Trust me. Trust me. Naadirah has secrets. -[knocking and shouting at door]
You all right, Luba?
I touch his dick and he jumps like a spooked dog.
[Akim] Gunther.
Let me help you.
All these people are here for IDs?
No, mate. The whole thing's organic. Different crews in on different days.
You know, chop shops, data miners, arms dealers, cybernetics.
If you want it, someone in here can supply it. Probably me.
The cops don't shut you down?
Nah, we migrate. Try not to overstay our welcome, you know?
I do not believe this shit.
[Toby] Rob! Rob! That motherfucker...
Hey! Jesus.
Come on.
[Rob] Oi! No trouble from you, son. Not today.
You lost, mate? Hmm?
I'm not interested in her, Leo.
We saw enough of her at the club. Didn't we?
Yeah, we did.
Take a hint and fuck off.
[Toby] You heard the man.
Now look, I'm not trying to be disrespectful. Am I, Rob?
[Rob] No, you're not stupid.
[Toby] What's a class bird like your missus doing with a Joey like you?
I mean, look at you. Mute, broke, bullshit fashion sense.
[Toby] Hey, are you even listening to me?
Fuck me, he's weird.
Oh, the duck flies. Oh, he flies.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, sit down. -Yeah, ball's loaded, babe.
Yeah.
So, you and Josie all plugged into the system now?
I think so.
-You know that bartender from the club? -Yeah.
He crashed the session.
-Are you serious? -I got Josie out of there.
Something's going on.
I don't know why you don't use my passport.
You know, do your fingertips,
retina implant, you gotta bleach your hair,
and then you gotta shave the lady tickler off.
I'd rather kill myself.
I understand. It's hard to be this good-looking.
It's a responsibility.
Yeah, that's it.
Are you gonna stick around here for the rest of your life?
Why not? Plenty of work, good perks.
Make better implants than anybody else.
I don't mind being the big fish.
Besides, my life's a lot less complicated than yours, babe.
As long as I've got enough to eat,
some cash to splash, and some cooch to smooch... [blows kiss] I am...
[blows kiss] I am...
Ooh! ...a happy man.
I should turn pro.
Oh, look at that.
School girls, babe.
Itty-bitty titties and smooth little pussies.
-Then they grow up. -Take your fucking shot.
I'll tell you something,
it's not gonna be long before you're fighting
all them young studs off that cutie-pie little daughter of yours.
Ow! Fuck!
Don't do that. Don't talk about my daughter.
Get off me, man.
Just fucking playing around, man.
You need to maintain a sense of humor, babe.
Ah, fuck!
Why don't you just build yourself a new hand, big fish?
Let me see it.
Come on, let me see it.
Hold this against it.
All right, I'll take your shot.
[groans] So close.
[Oswald on speaker] This is Oswald. I'm busy.
[Oswald on speaker] This is Oswald. I'm busy. Please leave packages downstairs.
Who the hell are you?
Hey! Hey!
You can't come barging into a man's home uninvited.
I could be entertaining.
This is my place.
What's your name?
That's... that's none of your business.
Don't worry about that.
Oi! Dickhead, that's private!
You speak English?
You speak Deutsch?
Oh, shit.
-You work for Nicky Simsek? -[automated voice speaking German]
-This is ridiculous. -[automated voice continues]
-Wait there. Hold on. -[automated voice continues]
If Nicky wants to keep this little sideline of his running,
he needs to get a better class of whore.
Fat Max wasn't even that fat.
And he should shower next time, between clients.
You're here for Naadirah.
I already paid her.
If Nicky didn't get his money, his problem is with her, not me.
But you can tell Nicky,
if he wants to do business with me, he can do it in person,
not through that thieving whore Naadirah.
Okay. Okay. All right. You wanna earn a bit?
Yeah, we can go on the bed.
You tell Nicky, you can come next time!
[Oswald] If Nicky didn't get his money, then his problem's with her, not me.
[Rhonna] This is Nicky.
He runs Maksim's business across the street.
Da stargo tora.
[Duck] How old are you, sweetheart?
[Kanwal] How old do you think I am?
I don't know. My eyes might be playing tricks on me, but I say 17, maybe?
-You don't think I could be 16? -Oh?
Kanwal, we don't need that kind of trouble.
-[Kanwal] I'm 21. -[woman] Twenty-two next week.
Why are you fucking this up for me? You hate money or something?
Kanwal, how would you like to make me feel 16 again?
Move your butt here.
-Are you really a doctor? -Yes, I am.
Don't look at me like that.
Carpe culus.
Is Tanya around?
I thought Kanwal was watching Josie.
Yeah, well, Prince Charming there just stole my babysitter.
Tanya!
Hey, Cactus.
Hey. Can you do me a favor? Watch Josie for a while?
Sure.
How are you, sweetie? That looks nice.
Need a babysitter again, Bill?
[Tanya] 'Course. It'll be fun.
[Cactus] What the fuck's on your face, Luba?
You want some dinner, angel?
[Cactus] Daddy's gotta go. Oh!
No soda.
-[Robert] Hey, Bill. -[siren sounds]
[Cactus] Sergeant.
You know, I've always wondered what goes on in this place.
I see a lot of guys going in tense and coming out smiling.
Not everyone enjoys their job as much as you, Robert.
Some of us need help to relax.
Not so much you, though.
You're always tense.
Think I might like to check it out sometime.
-Have a look around. -Any red-blooded male should.
Thing is, Uncle Sam's a cheap son of a bitch
and I gotta send most of my money back home to Sally and the kids.
You know the drill.
Well, hell, Robert,
let me have a word with the ladies inside and get you fixed up.
Hey, you do like the ladies?
Oh, I'm a straight shooter, Bill. You can bank on that.
You're a brother.
And being as we're bros,
I think it's only fair I tell you that somebody out there
is sure keen to see you get picked up by us.
Your ex-wife.
Yeah.
Willing to pay real money.
Good thing we're so close, then, huh?
[Robert] Take it easy, Cactus.
[man in German] Hey! Tell Maksim his car is ready.
[Nicky in English] I've been to America.
I didn't like it, but many of you do, so...
[in German] Can I help you?
[in English] Don't worry, he'll move on.
[woman] How freaky is that?
We have a beachside restaurant on the fifth floor.
Hey! What is this? Fucking art class? Hmm?
-[Nicky] What the fuck-- -[Tanya] Nicky, language.
Okay, take the kid out of here.
-I'm still hungry. -[Nicky] Please, Makiko,
-take the kid out of here. -Come on. Let's go.
See that syndicate over there?
They work with my boss, so all I got to do is call them over
and they'll cook your nutsack faster than this fine piece of fillet.
Do you understand?
[in German] Doesn't work for me.
You're a bit of a perv, aren't you?
I'm sure we can find someone at the massage parlor
to cater to your kink.
I said, she doesn't work for me.
Wait. I know you.
[in English] I know you. You're the barman.
Dude, I wouldn't tell your crazy ass anything if my life depended on it.
Who the fuck is this?
What are you doing searching for all these girls?
Are they related to you? Are you stalking them?
I think you need to leave. Now.
[in German] Come on, guys.
Would you escort this bartender back to his bottles?
They must be getting lonely by now.
What did you have in mind?
Yeah, we could do that.
[laughing] Yeah.
Yeah.
I know. I know. I know. I know. Yeah, I gotta go.
What the...
I'm so-- I'm sorry. Who is this gorgeous girl?
I seem to remember a really sad little girl coming in here.
A sad girl with one leg, but...
Are you sure it's the same girl?
Um... play Wayne.
Fit's perfect. I just wanna record her gait for analysis.
[woman] Of course.
[Duck] Take a look. Beautiful.
You are moving on that thing.
You're a pro. Here. We'll get you up on this treadmill
and Uncle Duck is gonna record this beautiful moment forever.
Careful now. Keep your back straight.
-Thank you so much, Dr. Teddington. -Please. My pleasure.
A nice straight back for me.
There you go.
Just walk normally.
That's it.
That's it. Yes.
Yes, indeed.
[man in German] Yes, I would like to order something.
Make it the pork with sauerkraut
and a beer.
No, track my phone. I'm out and about.
[automated voice in English] Welcome to Dig-Ins.
What can I do for you tonight?
Great. I just need you to tell me your phone number.
[man in German] I forget my phone number too.
I need my mental power for chick digits. [laughs]
[automated voice in English] Please tell me your phone number.
[in German] You have to speak your number into it.
That's messed up.
You can't talk at all?
Okay.
Let's see.
72 32 89 11
60 44 67.
You can't send food to this number.
[automated voice in English] Please enable tracking for this phone number.
[man in German] You can wait here or have it droned to your apartment.
[in English] Do you want a drink?
-What did you do to Nicky? -[classical music playing]
He said he needed to find Naadirah.
I've never seen him so scared.
And...
I mean, you did that.
It's... it's pretty impressive.
I thought you and Naadirah were trying to pull some disappearing act
to get away from me.
You really are looking for her.
Aren't you?
What, you like these?
Don't worry, they come off. You can borrow them.
Love is fucking crazy, man.
She needed money, and I told her I would get it because...
I hate myself enough to do that for her.
Would you?
Do you really love her that much? Would you do anything for her?
Anything?
If she's not with me,
why would she be with you? What are you?
You're nothing.
She's gone.
She took the money that I made for her
and she left!
And now...
Now Maksim knows what I did.
Fuck, I need to get out of here.
Do you want help in finding Naadirah?
I know you're not that big on technology, but do you know what this is?
I shouldn't be here.
I need to tell you something.
There's something you need to know about me.
I shouldn't be here.
I'm leaving you.
I shouldn't be here!
I need to call you, you know? I need to be able to reach you.
[automated voice] Naadirah.
Here's your FlyMeal. Bon appétit!
Da stargo tora.
[woman on speaker] Naadirah. Naadirah!
Naadirah! Naadirah? Naadirah?
[automated voice] Please quietly state the name of the publication you're looking for.
[woman] Just take my coat...
Here. Let me move that for you.
Oh, you're an American, are you? Lovely.
Now...
glasses, purse...
Would you be a dear and watch my things for a minute
while I go and get my biscuit?
It's called a fucking cookie!
Oh! Hello.
Did you bring your mom with you?
No, that's the new girl at the parlor.
I thought she'd make a nice change of pace for you.
Is that for me?
Maksim called.
What's he want?
He wants us to put the squeeze on Nicky Simsek.
Nicky?
That's heavy. He's a bad boy. But I thought he was team Maksim. What gives?
Asshole wants to find out what Nicky's been doing behind his back.
And you watch. I'm not gonna make a goddamn mark from this thing.
What did Nicky do?
Oh... [stammers] The fuck knows.
I...
Besides, Maksim's being all rapey about it.
"Do this to his ass. Do this to his ass. Do that..."
When did torture get so gay?
Jesus. You know, I've had training. Years have gone into these hands.
Now, I'm wasting it on this Spanish Inquisition bullshit.
That mute bartender was with Nicky.
They were probably just making very small talk.
-That's funny. -[chuckles]
You know, I think that freak is looking for Naadi.
Good luck with that.
What do you mean?
Nothing. Just...
I hope he finds her, so everyone can mellow the fuck out.
-What do you wanna do about Nicky? -Well...
I say, we just slice the guy a new fucking Jap's eye
and see what the son of a bitch has to say.
Hold on just a second. Lady, why don't you stare at your fucking tea,
because the next time you give me that stink eye,
I'm gonna take that cup and ram it so far up your snatch,
it'll look like you grew a third ear.
That way.
Jesus. People are so fucking rude.
You sure you want our help with this?
You seem to be doing a fine job beating the shit out of him without us.
-You want him on the table, babe? -Yeah. Put a sheet on it first.
[Duck] Thank you very much.
[Maksim] Cactus!
How are you?
Maksim. Where are my fucking IDs?
Tomorrow.
What is it? German Valentine's Day?
For your daughter. It's Trippies Sugar Bombs.
Come on. I know how much you miss home.
Trippies!
I feel bad. I didn't bring anything for you.
[Maksim] So, this is where you work?
Not much, but it's home.
-Who's this? -This is Duck.
We used to sleep together.
[Duck] Don't give him the wrong impression.
We were in Kabul together. Did a tour of duty. Shared a bunk.
Where we touched penises.
-Duck, how are you, my friend? -Nice to finally meet you.
-Do you need papers too? -Oh, no. No, sir.
No, I served all my time. [chuckles]
How are you?
This fucking mother-sucker...
Nicky has been sending girls out on personal business.
I want to know what the deal is Nicky has with this crazy bartender.
This kind of thing hurts my reputation.
You know what, Maksim? I don't care how many discos you own,
-you're still a dirty communist to me. -Hey!
You are a bitter man, Bill.
Like the world owes you something so much better.
But you live pretty good life.
You have a beautiful daughter, a nice house, women, friends.
I pay you good money.
You are living the dream. Trust me.
Be a little more courteous, Cactus.
I make your life possible.
[Duck] Don't take it personally, boss.
Cactus has been a dick to everybody lately.
Then take it out on this asshole.
[Maksim] Duck, do whatever you have to.
Whatever Nicky says, record and give to Gunther.
He'll stay with you.
It's your money.
And, Maksim, I want those fucking IDs in the system.
Passports, new birth certificate for Josie.
Certified data in the fucking net.
No problem. No problem.
[imitates Maksim] "No problem."
"No problem."
"No problem."
[in normal voice] Think I'm giving that poison to Josie?
They're called Sugar Bombs, for fuck's sake.
What an asshole.
[Duck] This is all just about finding Naadirah.
We know why the Mouth was hassling this guy. He's not gonna tell us anything new.
Maksim needs to hear what he needs to hear.
He's got some cockamamie story in his head? Let's give him just that.
Well, that's kinda harsh on slick here, you know?
Maybe give him a shot. Take the edge off?
[Cactus] No.
Not with the book club over there. It's gotta sound real.
Well...
-[Nicky whimpers] I haven't done anything. -It's been a blast, Nicky.
You are one unlucky son of a bitch.
My daddy always did say, "Girls are nothing but trouble."
Ducky boy!
Hey, Duck, where you at?
Hey.
When did you get here?
"Itty-bitty titties," huh?
Jesus Christ. Are you high?
Stay the fuck away from my daughter.
Don't talk to her.
Don't touch her. Don't even look at her.
As far as you're concerned, she doesn't exist. Got it?
What the fuck, Bill?
I know what you are, you sick son of a bitch.
And I got a good idea what was going on in Kabul too.
-What the fuck are you talking about? -I saw your cameras.
Oh, come on, man.
The fucking cameras are for patients. I use them for work.
How long has it been going on?
I...
I just installed them.
I haven't even recorded anybody.
Don't lie to me. I just saw a little girl...
...naked on your screen. You gonna lie to me now?
I... I was... I was just messing around.
Like, as a game...
"A game"? No.
Basketball's a game. Tiddlywinks is a game.
Bowling is a fucking game, Donald!
-Well-- -This is gonna stop, right now.
The minute you're thinking, while you're thinking of something?
You're thinking of it.
But the second you do something, that is a world of pain, my friend.
I know. I--
-No, you don't. Clearly, you don't know. -[groans]
Here's what's gonna happen. You are done treating kids.
There are plenty of other doctors that can do it.
No child is going to step foot in this fucking room ever again.
Okay.
You wanna know what else?
Now I know.
What does that mean?
Means it ain't a secret anymore.
The second that you do something,
or the second that I think that you're even thinking about doing something,
I am going to break your fucking arms.
From your shoulders all the way down to your fingernails.
-Jesus, Bill. -Got it?
What the--
-Got it? -Yes, I...
-Got it? -Yes. I... I... Yes.
I will. I will try.
[groans] Fuck.
[stammers] Don't. I'll do it.
I'll stop. I promise. I promise I'll stop.
I promise.
[stammering] And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Come here.
Fuck. I love you, brother.
All right? I won't let anything happen.
Yeah.
Talk to me, Maksim.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Tell me when and I'll pick 'em up.
All right.
Yeah, thanks, Maksim. Thank you.
I got my papers.
Josie's, mine.
Everything.
Well, that's great.
Yeah.
It's great.
We're gonna celebrate.
Grab your shit. We're going to the mall.
Fuck you!
DOCTOR ON CALL
[Cactus] Oh, my God! I'm so homesick.
Oh, I'm gonna have a burger, baby.
A real fucking hamburger with real fucking red meat.
[Naadirah on speaker] Stop hiding. You are so beautiful.
[sobbing] Leo?
Leo.
Leo.
Leo, Naadirah. Leo, Naadirah.
There's someone I need to tell you about.
Cactus. Cactus.
Cactus. Cactus.
[Naadirah] Leo, where are we going?
It's freezing cold.
Judy, Judy, Judy! More beer!
[Duck] I got 'em.
Stand down, Judy.
There you go, darling.
[Cactus] Thank you.
I got a plan.
Lay it on me.
I wanna give you the house.
Cactus, no.
The house, man. It's yours.
Cactus...
It's perfect. Look...
Get rid of the surgery. Get rid of that whole kids cyberwear deal.
Ah, yeah, all right.
Give yourself a little perspective on things.
-Hey, I have to make money, babe. -Exactly, from Maksim.
-That fucking Russian prick? No way. -He needs a surgeon and I'm gone.
He's met you. He knows that I trust you.
Come on, man. It's pulling rounds and sewing tears.
-You could do it in your sleep. -I don't know.
You'll be doing the same amount of work, but getting paid double.
Look, you sell the clinic? You got it made in the shade, buddy.
I can't believe you're really going, babe.
End of an era.
Fuckin' A.
To you, my friend.
You, sir, I love.
-The band in the sand. -Band in the sand.
Fuck it.
Let's get laid.
My treat.
We gotta stop and get Josie first. Kanwal wants to take off early. Uh-huh.
Hey, Cactus...
I wanna thank you for everything.
Oh, shut up. Have a peanut.
No, hey...
Thank you.
I'm serious, man. Thank you.
Gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too, babe.
Hey, I'm sorry I've been such a dick lately.
I've had a lot on my mind.
Hey, listen.
I gotta tell you something too.
I'm kind of fucking with that mute bartender.
Leo.
Just, you know, like, on the phone. [laughs]
-Why would you do that? -[man exclaims in German]
Like you said, you were kind of being a dick.
He could've fucked everything up.
Hey, relax.
He's a goof.
Asshole.
Hey! Hey! Excuse me, please.
-Who is this? -[Cactus chuckles]
She's a jealous little Nazi.
Hey, hey, stop!
You're just not our type, okay? God, what is wrong with her?
Penis envy.
You must pay, sir.
What, did they have a half day at school today?
Huh? Who says I should pay for this?
You? You says?
Is that it?
I'm talking to you, not your faggot friends.
I've got a better idea.
How about I just eat all of them?
And that way, there's no fucking evidence. Hmm?
You are under arrest.
[laughs] Okay, why don't you grow a foot and come back and talk to me man-to-man?
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
You mean business? How's this for business?
Fifty cents worth of candy?
How about I pop out your pupil and put the change in the socket?
[Duck] Cactus, don't fuck up your last night in Berlin.
Cactus, come on. Come on.
-[grunts] -That's for fucking with my shit.
Please. Please.
There you go.
It's a little word, but it makes such a difference.
It's a crime to be so selfish
when there's so much of me to go round, right?
What's happened to your lip?
Oh, um... I tripped. Such a klutz.
Have you ever played seesaw?
-You don't know seesaw? -[Kanwal] No.
[Duck] They have seesaws here, right?
Yeah.
[Duck] Never taken Josie to a park all this time in Berlin?
I'm gonna teach you girls everything. I'm gonna teach you...
kick the can, monkey in the middle.
-Oh, I'd love to. -Yeah?
Teach you four square? Ever played?
-Let's go. -No.
If we play four square, we might need some more rubbers.
Come on. Let's go.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah. Fucking fantastisch.
Maksim, talk to me.
All right, I'm gonna be there in 15 minutes.
[sighs] Do you think you could...
[woman] Josie? Hmm.
Sure, she can stay. She's no trouble.
[Duck] That's it, baby girl. You want more?
You know what? It's all right. I'm gonna take her with me.
Hey, wanna go for a ride with Daddy? Yeah?
Bye-bye.
[in German] Hey, isn't that Maksim's car?
What? I can't believe it.
Leo?
Jesus Christ.
What the hell?
It's all right. Don't move. Don't move, it's okay.
Are you in some kind of turf war or something? What the hell happened?
[softly] Barman. The barman...
He's looking for you.
He has your address.
Where are the documents?
Where the fuck are my IDs, Maksim?
He took them.
Took them.
[man on TV] Yeah, I'll give her a surprise. A big surprise.
Got your seat belt on, sweetie?
[man on TV] What's going on in here?
[Cactus] Duck!
You hear me? He's got my papers and he's got my address.
-I'm dropping Josie at the-- Move! -[car honking]
I'm dropping Josie at the parlor and then I'm home. Meet me there.
[automated voice] If you have any information
on American military personnel absent without leave,
please notify MPs in your district.
[whispers] Wait here. I'll be right back.
You think I'm gonna let you take my daughter away from me? Huh?
That's insane.
You're crazy. You're a crazy fucking bitch, you know that?
She's family.
She's my blood.
I'll kill you before I let that happen.
You're evil!
You are evil!
You need time to get your mind right, Naadi.
That's it.
You need a lot of time.
[Cactus] Jesus, Nicky,
these stairs are gonna kill ya.
Here.
Go ahead.
Open it.
Did you make this?
This is some quality work.
I like the dolphins.
Hey, can you make me some bookshelves?
I take your silence as a "no."
Where do you think you're going, you big, dumb son of a bitch?
You gonna give me some trouble, big boy?
Or are you gonna channel that famous Amish Gelassenheit serenity?
[sighs] Jeez.
What the fuck did she ever see in a fruitcake like you?
Fuck you.
Fucking mute freak.
Lose your keys, Cactus?
Shit.
Oh, fuck, man. Oh.
-[gurgling] -Oh, that's bad, babe.
I don't think there's anything I can do here. Maybe I can...
Maybe if I got you back to my place or maybe a hospital, where I...
Is that what... You want a hospital?
Oh, I don't think so, babe. I...
They'll talk. They'll say something. They'll call the police.
No, you don't want that, babe.
[Naadirah on speaker] Leo, stop hiding.
You are so beautiful.
Da stargo tora. The black of my eyes.
Why'd you have to kill Naad, babe?
You had it made.
All this over a broad?
You're smarter than that.
I always knew your temper was gonna get you into trouble.
You should have been nicer to me, Bill.
[Duck] There you two lovebirds are.
-You and I need to have a talk. -[grunts]
You know who had a great voice? My grandpa.
Smoked three packs a day. Had to have his voice box removed.
When you start out, you're gonna sound something like that.
Big fella like you is gonna need a deeper voice than that, right?
Yeah.
[Duck] She's watching cartoons.
Kids, right?
You killed that little girl's dad.
You did that.
Not me. You.
You should apologize.
[Leo's automated voice] Stop the pain.
I'm so sorry I killed your buddy Cactus.
Yeah, well, you should be sorry.
Say you're sorry.
Fucking say it!
There.
-Now, say it. -[gasps]
[Duck] Say it.
I got an idea.
I'm gonna show you something.
[Duck] ...then dip into France, we can go anywhere.
We can go to Florence, we can go to London, go to Cannes...
see all the movie stars.
Let's just say we can have a lot of fun, baby. A lot of fun.
Morning, sir. Was wondering when you might be joining us.
You look beat.
Oh, uh, Josie, this is Leo. Leo, this is Josie.
The young lady and I were just discussing the splendors of the Cote d'Azur.
You have any tales you'd like to regale us with?
Stories of the French high life?
Nothing?
Josie, how about you?
Nothing?
You may have your father's eyes,
but you do not have his knack for conversation.
It's supposed to be fun. You're supposed to be having fun.
[automated voice] Hi, Bill. Your battery is at 37%.
Anything?
Go ahead, say something.
Did all that work.
All right, you stay in the car, darling.
Uncle Duck's gotta drop Leo off.
You recognize this place?
No?
Your photo of Naadirah...
I took it...
here.
Bill and I used to come up here with Naadi in the summer
with her friends, back in the day.
She was a real hottie back then.
Before she got all fucking knocked up.
You see that?
Ain't that the sweetest thing?
It's funny, you know, because now... they're together forever because of you.
You did that.
Fucking you!
Well, I tried, Bill!
Fucking goon's got a heart of stone.
Looks high.
Shit!
I chopped your girlfriend's tits off and I wore them as fucking earmuffs!
Fucking say it.
You fucking say it. You fucking say it!
You fucking say it.
"I'm sorry, Duck. I'm sorry about your friend."
-[Leo inhales deeply] -"I'm sorry that I did that to him."
Get the fuck off of me! Get the fuck off!
[Josie] Leo!
Leo!
Leo, are you okay?
[distorted] No!
Josie, get back!
It's dangerous!
It's dangerous.
You sound funny.

[man] Morning.
[man] Ward.
Red sauce? Green sauce?
[woman] Babe, you up?
It's after noon, you gotta get up.
I made some coffee, come on.
[woman] There he is.
-Morning. -Afternoon.
-Hi. -Hi.
Hi.
-[whispers] Coffee. -I know.
What the hell's this in my--
-What's that shit in there? -What?
-Whoops. -Yeah.
Ran out of coffee filters, had to use a napkin.
-It'll be fine. -I'll just chew that up next time.
-[high-pitched chattering] -Oh, come on.
Why is the Fairy in the bird feeder again?
-I-- I thought-- -You told me that you killed it.
All right, I'm gonna be honest with you. All right?
-Please. -I don't fuck with no Fairies.
You need to fuck with that one.
When I was little, my cousin DayDay was throwing rocks at this Fairy.
-The Fairy shit in his own hand... -Uh-huh.
...threw the shit, and it went in DayDay's eye,
and it was like a fucking cantaloupe.
-Bullshit story. -No, he almost lost his eye.
-I'm telling you. Listen-- -That's not true.
$200. Pay the man. Same man that does the bees.
No, I'm not paying $200.
I got this big, handsome, strapping man standing right in front of me.
Go kill that Fairy, please. Thank you so much.
I'll kill the Fairy. Let me finish my coffee.
-I'mma kill the Fairy. All right? -Okay.
That may kill you. You should do it before you finish the coffee. [chuckles]
-How was work? -Eh, work. Work is good, you know?
Just, a lot of stab wounds lately. There's, uh...
We had this homeless guy come in, throwing equipment everywhere.
It was wild.
A lot of traffic accidents,
-and this older guy, he coded out on me. -[man] What about that cop that's an Orc
that's now on the LAPD force?
-How does that work? -[man 2] He's not blooded.
He's not part of any blooded clan.
He's like a finger that got cut off the hand.
He's dead to us.
[sighs heavily] This is shock trauma at its finest.
[man] ...and then you see the humans and the Elves...
I don't want this guy in my car either.
Baby, I don't want you to get shot again.
Five years, I'm gonna retire.
But... I can't fuck up my pension.
All right? I mean, that's my fucking worst nightmare.
You know what my worst nightmare is?
It's them wheeling you in when I'm at work.
That's my nightmare.
Come on. Come here.
-[squeal, thud] -Fairy. Now.
[man] Hey, y'all, I want y'all to trip off my police-ass neighbor. He's a trip.
-Good afternoon, Officer. -Hey. What up, Mike?
Yo, that Fairy been all up in my crib,
eating up my dog food and shit.
I'm about to call the city, man.
I am the city.
All right? You save your dime.
Fairy lives don't matter today.
Check this out, y'all. This is probably gonna be good.
-[Fairy chattering] -[man] It's on now!
-[Fairy shrieks] -[Mike] Ring the bell, y'all.
Damn. Look at this nigga, man.
-[grunts] -Oh, that's it right there.
Oh, you got it now. Take the homie out LAPD-style like you do.
[all] Oh!
[man 1] You ain't gotta do him like that. Damn!
[Mike] That was nasty.
-[man 2] Man. -[man 1] Come on, G.
-It's what I do. -[Mike] Oh, shit.
Oh, and, uh, you keep doing all your gangsta stuff.
I'm just trying to sell my house. Don't worry about that.
[man 3] Thanks for the show, Officer.
He's a trip. That motherfucker's crazy. Got a fine-ass wife, too.
Are you in trouble?
Am I in trouble? What your mother say to you?
Mom said that Nick got you in trouble because Orcs are dumb.
That's not true, all right? Orcs are not dumb.
Just, uh-- All of the races are-are different. Okay?
And just 'cause they're different doesn't mean anybody's smarter
or dumber, you know,
better or worse than anybody.
All right? It's just-just...
You know, everybody's just trying to get along and-and...
have a good life.
What the hell?
Hey, baby, you gotta take some clothes. Get some clothes.
-Fine. -[horn honks]
-[rap music playing] -Hey, hey!
Hey, partner.
Ready to get back to work? All healed up?
What the hell are you doing at my house?
Why are you at my house? Why are you on my lawn?
Your lawn's dead, Ward.
Exactly. Which is why I seeded it
and spread cow shit everywhere so it grows back.
That's not really cow shit.
-What do you mean it's not cow shit? -It's sewage, from toilets.
From the treatment plant, swear to God.
I paid $400 for this.
-That's bullshit. -Human shit.
-Why do you think I compost? -Whatever. Whatever. Whatever.
You don't ever come here in that ever again.
I was at diversity training. Your house is on the way to the bar. I thought--
-Hi, Nick. -Hey, Sophia. What's up, rock star?
We're gonna go to Grandma's.
-Grandma's? Hop in, we'll give you a ride. -Shut up.
-This ain't no Uber, man. -Don't tell Nick to shut up.
He's a person, too.
Oh, thank you, sweetie.
That's an enlightened kid you got there, Daryl.
[grunts] Don't worry about me.
Just Crip-walk your asses on back to the barbecue.
Be nice to give you a ride...
-Shut up. -...on your first day back.
Lovely song.
There's Grandma.
Hey. Uh, I'm...
Okay. Good to see you.
Uh...
All right, baby. What's up?
What's happening? What's up? Why you sad?
What happened?
I don't want you to die.
I'm not gonna die. What are you--
-What you talking about? -Mama said Nick's gonna get you killed.
[stammers] I don't know why she said...
Nick is not gonna get me killed, all right?
Why do you have to be a policeman?
Everybody hates policemen.
Hey...
Know what? You smell like you haven't slept.
I have melatonin in my war bag. You take one before bed,
-turn off the laptop, get-- -Maybe I'm having trouble sleeping
because of the nightmares I'm having
from being blasted across the street with a shotgun
while your ass was getting a burrito.
But I was getting a burrito for you.
-Yeah-- -I don't eat cow flesh.
Do you think that you could get a burrito
and do your job?
You think you could get a burrito and watch my back
-like every other cop manages to do? -Yes.
Look, I know... you're disappointed in me.
I know that you think that I let you down.
-Yeah. You know what? -But I--
-[sighs] -You know what? It's a new day.
Back to work. We hitting the reset button.
Copy that. Copy that. We're hitting the reset button.
Moving forward together.
As friends, together.
We will not be listening to no Orkish music.
That is one of the greatest love songs ever written.
That's a love song in prison.
I believe that you're lacking in love, Ward.
-I'm what? -By love, I mean...
like... physical love.
Yeah. Um...
Right?
I'm straight. I don't need no physical love. Trust me, I'm good.
You can't hide it, Ward.
Humans have physical tells.
-Tells, huh? -Yeah.
-It's called a face. -I ain't making no face.
-Like the face you're making right now. -I ain't making no face.
All right.
What face am I making?
"A human who needs a lot more conjugal love" type face.
"Conjugal love" face. So you know human face--
Show me another human face.
-What's another one we make? -Oh, uh...
-What's that face? -Human who doesn't get anymore pancakes.
-We do like our pancakes, for real. -I got a lot of 'em.
-You got a lot? -I got a lot of them.
Show me the face an Orc makes when he just shut the fuck up,
and don't say shit, and just drive to work.
Yeah, that's it! That's it! Oh, you got that one!
-[rock music playing] -[Ward] Yeah, you killing that one.
You should do that one. Do that one, like, all the time.
[Ward] Whoa. Whoa. Why you going this way?
[​Jakoby] It's fine, it's a shortcut.
See? They're very nice here.
[Ward] Dude, you can't go through Elftown.
You are killing me. Killing me, dude.
So, what, you trying to... get yourself some designer shoes?
Ain't nothing over here but rich-ass Elves
just running the world and shopping.
[Ward] I hate Elftown.
Even the chauffeurs are snobs. ♪ I'm running for the crown ♪
Hey. Back already, Ward?
Where's the, uh, diversity hire you ride with?
Yeah, what kind of partner is Jakoby? Is he your dance partner?
Your sexual partner?
'Cause he fucking sucks at catching bad guys.
That's Clan Law shit, dog.
Orcs got each other's backs.
Hey, look, why y'all acting like I put this dude in my car?
So what are you doing to get him the fuck out of this division?
Hey, long as he pull his weight, I ain't got no beef with him.
No. No, no, no. You could do shit, man.
You could write a letter. His ass would be gone if we back you up.
That's a fact.
-But you only care about yourself, Ward. -Right.
Did I... Did I ask you for advice?
'Cause I'll probably wait till I'm on my, like, ninth divorce,
then your advice will come in really handy.
That's good. That's fucking good. Noted.
Meanwhile, that Orc fuck is still out there
because Jakoby chose clan blood over the badge.
Or the motherfucker just got away.
He got away 'cause Jakoby let him.
What happens next?
What happens the next time this pig motherfucker
makes a cop suck-start his fucking 12-gauge?
Only this time, it's Brown,
or it's Hicks, or it's fucking me.
How you gonna feel, Ward? 'Cause that shit is on you.
Well, if you in the box, I'll probably be like...
-[chuckles] -Ward, you son of a bitch.
Hey, look, I got a dude in my car,
the whole world is watching, all right?
I didn't ask for it, I don't want it, but I don't get a vote.
And what happens if they hire more? You know what they say.
Once with the Dark Lord, always with the Dark Lord.
They chose evil.
Here's the thing I can't understand.
How do a bunch of dudes who can barely remember their baby mama's birthday
have beef with a whole race
over some shit that happened 2,000 years ago?
Here's the fucking deal, man.
You keep Jakoby the fuck away from me. Okay?
I'll drop an Orc. I don't give a fuck.
My ancestors killed them by the fucking thousands in Russia.
-[man 1] Attaboy, Ward! -[man 2] About time, Ward.
[woman] All right, settle down, settle down. The captain's coming.
[Jakoby] Ward, I saved you a seat.
[woman] Take it away, boss.
Ward, nice to see you back.
Cap.
-[captain] Tonight's the trifecta. -Hey, is that your cousin?
[captain] Full moon, Friday night...
-No. -...summer heat wave.
That means: clear your calls fast,
help your colleagues clear theirs,
get me out of this deployment period without another murder,
I'll buy you all coffee.
Sergeant Ching, all yours.
[Ching] All right, after I call your name, get your shotguns and radios and deploy.
I don't want to see you here unless there's bad guys under the desks.
Three-Mary-25, Pollard.
Three-Mary-55, Kim.
Three-Mary-60, Thomas.
Three-A-21, Pippen and Gosser.
Three-A-54, Hancock and Wheeler.
Three-A-80, Crawford and Duncan.
Three-A-9, Jakoby and Ward.
-Three-A-34, Jones and Morengo. -Hey, uh, hit the kit room.
-Three-A-82, Ortiz and Mencia... -I'll meet you at the gas pumps.
-I'll be right down. I just need to-- -Okay.
Three-A-99...
-No. -Yes. Put him in another car.
What the fuck about my demeanor gives you the impression
that I want to be a target on the department's Orc-diversity radar?
These decisions are made nine miles above me.
No. They're made right on your paper, right there.
Scratch him out.
Scratch his name out. Put another name, anybody.
Ward, no one wants to ride with you.
Goodbye. Don't get shot again.
Good luck.
-[man] Hey, looking good, bud. -[woman] Looking real good. Real good.
Be safe, guys.
What's up, homies?
Your ass still alive?
You know something about that?
It wasn't me.
Get the fuck off of the street or I'mma call your PO,
tell him you out drinking with the homies.
I ain't gonna tell you two times.
Let's go.
I need to know if the shit pop off with these Fogteeth fools
that you got my back, that you a cop first.
Are we clear?
Clear.
I'm about dope, money, and guns. That's my job.
Your job is to make sure I go home at night.
-I don't like this small talk. -This ain't no small talk.
This is big-ass talk.
We doing real shit out here.
[dispatcher] All Westlake units, three-A-4 is requesting assistance.
-Sixth and Whitmore. Sixth and Whitmore. -[siren wailing]
-[tires screeching] -All Westlake units, Three-A-4...
Get him the fuck on the ground!
Back the fuck up!
-Stay there! Stay right fucking there! -[overlapping shouts]
-Do not resist! Don't-- -[officer 2] Shut the fuck up!
I need to know if you're a cop first...
or an Orc first.
-I need to hear you say it. -Ward, I...
I wanted to be a cop since I was a little kid.
I am nothing else.
My badge means more to me than the air I breathe.
So don't question me.
[dispatcher] Three-A-9, 415. Fifth and Westlake.
Code two, incident 2415.
Three-Adam-9. Roger, show us en route.
Three-A-9, roger.
The fuck outta here.
-[siren wailing] -[man grunts] God damn it!
-[man continues grunting] -Rodriguez. Hey.
-Oh, shit, man. I thought you were dead. -[laughs]
Nah, man, too many bills to pay.
[Rodriguez] I hear ya.
[Ward] I thought you were out having your, like, zillionth baby.
Ah, nah, man. Marisol's a week late. We're inducing next week, though.
-Number five. -[exhales]
-Five. -Lot of mouths to feed.
Yeah, man.
[voice echoes] Sir...
drop the sword.
You.
The Army of Nine Races fought shoulder to shoulder
to give you the world you neglect.
-Hey, tell him to shut up. -[man] 2,000 years ago,
-we fought them with swords and arrows. -Sir--
And now, the Dark One returns to reclaim Orc hearts!
Everywhere I go, why have Orcs always gotta be the bad guys?
Hey, don't look at me, man. Mexicans still get shit for the Alamo.
-[woman screams] -Get back! Get back!
Sir, unless you wanna die, you drop that sword right fucking now!
Hey, you got me shot, don't get me stabbed.
[Jakoby] Turn around, sir.
-Hands on your head. -I'm doing it, man. Jeez.
-On your knees. -I-- All right.
-[horn honking] -[Jakoby] Don't move.
Having a little fun.
Aah! Shit!
All right. Damn.
I'm not resisting, man.
Three-Adam-9, one in custody.
[dispatcher] All units, code four. Fifth and Westlake, suspect in custody.
Okay, man, easy. Gimme a-- Gimme a-- Ow!
-Hey. -Hey.
Real quick.
Gang intel said Fogteeth's been smashing like a motherfucker,
and Altamira's gangbanging like it's 1999.
-Watch your backs out there. -Hey, you too.
-All right, brother. -Kiss your family.
Sir, can you sit back?
You-You stink like shit. Can you sit back?
Thank you.
Come on.
That's bad.
[in Orkish] I have a message from the Shield of Light.
Remember the old ways.
Remember what you are.
Is that Orkish?
How the hell do you know how to speak Orkish?
What'd he say?
[in Orkish] Remember your traditions.
Only clan ways can save you.
The Prophecy has chosen you.
The man with you is blessed.
-[horn honking] -Jakoby!
Come on, man.
What the hell is your problem? What'd he say?
He's not making any sense.
[captain] Where's Jakoby?
Uh, booking our body, ma'am.
Um, I love your hair.
-Who are you? -[chuckles]
I'm the unemployment line, or a prison sentence.
I could be the Angel of Mercy, but it's up to you, buddy.
Ah.
Internal Affairs.
That's right, all fucking day long. Now, let's review, kids.
Some pigskin piece of shit puts a load of buckshot into your trauma plate.
-Shithead foot-bails, Jakoby pursues... -Hey!
-[people shouting] -Hey!
[in Orkish] Police! Stop!
...corners his asshole in, what, a dead-end alley?
[man 1] Jakoby states dude tackled and disarmed him.
Then jumped on a fire escape ladder and evaded arrest.
Jakoby's signed statement.
[man 2] Ladder's 13 feet off the ground. We measured.
-[man 1] Mm-hmm. -[man 2] No Orc has a six-foot vertical.
Perhaps the suspect was light on his feet, sir.
Do Orcs have, uh, mad hops?
How many Orcs are ballers?
-Excuse me? -You fuckin' heard the detective.
-How many Orcs play pro basketball? -None.
They're slow, they're heavy.
That's why half the NFL defensive lines are Orkish.
It's not racism, it's physics.
Jakoby kicked loose that pigskin fuck who blasted you.
Do the math.
Orcs hold Clan Law above all else. That's a fact.
The Jakoby issue is sensitive. The world's watching.
-We can't fire him without cause. -[man 2] Which is why...
you're gonna get him to admit it...
and you're gonna record him.
The fuck outta here.
I want the guy out of my car, but...
I snitch, I'm done as a street cop.
We know, uh, you got a house note you can't pay down.
Right? Drowning in debt.
Raising a little girl you can't afford to pay for.
Mmm.
Father of the fucking year.
You talk about my family again, I'll split your fucking head open.
Ward.
You need this job.
Don't throw it away for Jakoby.
Get off me. Get off me.
Give it to me.
No testifying...
no depositions,
no paperwork.
Good man.
Very smart.
Shave your mustache, bitch.
It's just business.
Place is a shithole.
An Orc with a badge.
Incredible.
That's some shit you don't see every day. Like an Elf with a mop.
Did you see those two guys?
I think they're feds. Could they be here for me?
Feds don't give a shit about the LA Orc community.
Yeah, you're right.
S... So, my-my daughter...
um...
Sophia...
she be doing shit all the time, man, that she don't have no business doing.
Um...
But... she comes clean.
She always tells the truth.
'Cause she realized it feels good.
Feels good to her, feels good to me.
And, uh, truth just has a way...
of clearing the air between people.
If it cleanses-- cleanses some shit, you know,
it's like, just tell the truth.
I know something very bad happened at the station.
I know.
So are you gonna tell me about it or no?
I'm talking about you. All right?
Don't be trying to twist this. Nothing happened at the--
-I'm not-- -[dispatcher] ...trouble, 341 Abrams.
Code two, incident 2815.
Three-Adam-9, show us en route.
-[siren wailing] -[Ward] 341 Abrams.
[dispatcher] Three-A-9, roger.
How long you been in Shield of Light?
What's that?
[grunts] God!
You little fuck-up.
-[buzzer whirs, stops] -Aah! Shit! What are you doing, man?
-[grunts] -[man] No questions, just shut up.
Hey, nice Shield of Light tattoo!
-Good one. -You know who we are?
-Housekeeping. -[chortles]
You might wanna look at this.
Fuck. Magic Task Force.
Right. The magic feds.
You know, Serling, if you're gonna play stupid games,
you're gonna win stupid prizes.
Fuck you.
You wanna test me, asshole?
Okay! I'm not your enemy, man.
What do you know about the Inferni?
Um... they're Elves.
Renegade Elves.
Renegade Elves, sorry.
Because Elves are awesome, right?
They're gonna bring back the Dark Lord.
Fairy fucking tales.
How do they plan to do that?
When they get three Magic Wands, they can raise him from the dead.
[Elf] You recognize her?
That's Leilah.
She's an Inferni coven leader.
She's a Bright.
You ever notice how most Brights are Elves,
and Elves run the world?
Coincidence?
There are human Brights.
One in a million.
But you know how you know if you're a Bright?
When you touch a Wand...
with your bare hand...
and don't explode.
Would you do that?
Would you die to learn the truth about yourself?
If I had a Wand... I'd try.
[man] Let's get back on track.
So Leilah has a Magic Wand, and she's coming after Tikka, right?
And she'll shred this city to do it.
We get Tikka, we can set a trap for Leilah.
We hunt Wands, we hunt Brights.
That's what we do, and we're pretty fucking good at it.
You wanna help us?
Come on.
The Dark Lord's coming.
What, are you gonna to fight him with, with tanks?
Huh? You gonna drone him?
Two thousand years ago, magic stopped him.
And magic will stop him again.
One day, you all are gonna come begging for our help.
And we'll be there. We'll stop him.
The Shield of Light will stop him.
I'm done.
We're done.
If you act like my enemy...
you become my enemy.
See that?
-[Jakoby] Oh, it's a spotter. -[Ward] Mm-hmm.
[Ward] Get down! Down! Go!
-Oh. Yeah, that's-- That's not good. -[dogs barking nearby]
-Yeah. -We could die.
-First time being shot at? -Yeah.
I have to say, I dislike it very much.
-Yeah, it fucking sucks. -[bullet ricochets]
All right, look... on three, we're gonna dump this asshole.
-[gunshots] -All right?
Right. That makes sense. [stammers] Use force.
-All right. -Yeah.
One, two, three.
-You all right? -Hmm? Yeah.
-No holes? -Huh? Uh...
Only the ones that I was born with.
How are your holes?
The fuck can you make a shootout awkward?
Sorry.
Sorry.
[Ward] Wait for the reload! All right?
-He's gonna have to reload. -Reload.
Now!
-[both panting] -[Jakoby] Shit.
We got him.
Get the door. Get the door.
-Shouldn't we wait for the cavalry? -We are the cavalry.
Ward, can't we wait for backup? Ward.
[Ward] Go, go, go.
-[Ward panting] -[Jakoby] I smell blood, Ward.
Lots of blood.
-[Jakoby] What's that? -[Ward whispers] Don't know.
[Jakoby] Oh, shit.
-Body. Body. -[Jakoby] What?
Shit. Shit.
[Ward] Cover the hall.
-What the fuck is that? -Cover the hall.
Okay.
[whispers] Oh, shit.
Don't touch anything.
[stammers] Yeah.
-[Ward] Body. -[Jakoby] Wh--?
[Ward] That's our shooter, he's down.
[Jakoby] Someone's in here. I can smell them.
These people died so bad.
[Ward] Clear.
[exhales] Something unusual has happened here.
Three-Adam-9, 341 Abrams.
Possible Bright at our location.
Request additional units and a supervisor.
I repeat: Possible magic-user on scene.
[Ward] Hey! Freeze!
You! Wait, stop!
Hey! Hey!
Stop running!
-Hold her, hold her! -Stop! Stop! Stop!
What has she got?
-[high-pitched ringing] -What is that? What is that?
Go get the homies.
Put it down or I'm gonna shoot you in your face!
Is that...?
It's a Magic Wand.
[Ward] Who, uh...
Who are you?
[in Elvish] Please protect me.
[Jakoby] She's speaking Elvish.
I don't speak Elvish.
Well, I took two years in high school, but, uh...
She said somebody's coming.
Please protect me and the Wand.
As far as I can tell, a Bright came in, used the Wand, and...
magicked everybody the fuck up. Uh...
We need to evacuate this neighborhood, secure the scene,
hold the perimeter till the feds get here.
What the fuck are you, new?
-This is way above our pay grade. -[man] That's magic right there.
That's whatever you want.
You want a million dollars?
You want ten million?
You wanna be taller or shorter?
Make your dick bigger?
You wanna go back in time, marry the girl who didn't blow you on prom night?
That's how you do it, right there.
Well, clearly, we had different prom nights.
But that is a Magic Wand,
and you don't know how to use it.
And you're gonna kill us all trying.
Only a Bright can use a Wand, and you don't look like a wizard to me.
-Don't put your hands on that Wand. -[shushing]
-[Ward] Hey, don't touch the Wand. -I got it.
[Ward] Don't touch it.
Hey, hey, hey. [stammers] Don't be--
Fucking ice cold.
-All right, you're not stealing that Wand. -Nobody's coming, Ward.
Whoa. Hey--
Fuck is you squaring off on, bitch?
Hey, Sarge, you need to talk to your boys right now.
You need this just as much as we do, maybe more.
Your family depends on you. Don't you wanna be there for them?
What about Jakoby?
[in Elvish] Can you tell me your name?
-[whispers] Tikka. -Tikka.
My name is Tikka.
We have to leave before she comes.
Before who comes?
It's not happening.
No. No.
Pollard, he's spinning.
-No, he's not spinning worth shit. -[Pollard] He's fine, he's fine.
-This is stupid. -Calm down.
-Hey, fucking chill. He's fine. -Back up.
-He's fin-- Hey, hey! -The fuck you gonna do?
Calm down. Fucking calm down. Back the fuck up.
Back the fuck up. Listen. Listen.
This is happening.
-This is fucking happening. -Fuck off of me. [sighs]
All right?
-Fuck. -It's okay.
It's okay.
There's no version of you walking out of here with life as you know it intact.
Fuck this. We are taking the Wand, and the Orc dies.
And you got a big decision right now.
Either your little girl grows up without a daddy and Jakoby dies,
or just Jakoby dies. And it is time to make a choice.
[Ching] You or him, Ward. You or him.
Is tomorrow's LA Times gonna say one cop died here, or two?
Yeah, there it is. He just caught up to it.
[Pollard] Everyone wins.
Department gets rid of Jakoby, he dies a hero, public's happy.
This report writes itself.
The perfect storm, bro.
It's the perfect storm.
You okay?
Hey. Take Sophia, get out of town right now.
What? Why?
Get out of town right now. I love you.
[Jakoby] Ward, where is everyone? We haven't even set a perimeter.
I'm pretty certain that pee-wee gangster saw the Wand.
And she is spooked. Says somebody's coming.
Like-- Like, someone bad.
But what's...?
You seem like you-you have bigger troubles.
You let the shooter go, didn't you?
'Cause he was clan blood?
Now? You wanna fucking go through this right now?
What else you lie about, pigface?
Don't put your fucking hands on me!
You fucked me.
You fucked us both.
Pigskin piece of shit.
You fucked my whole life over some stupid Orc knucklehead.
Fuck you, Ward.
Fuck off.
-What--? -I dare you.
I dare you to pull your gun. Please.
Go ahead.
I will fuck you up in a gunfight.
I gave you plenty of time to talk about this shit.
-Karma is a bitch, and here it come. -I let him go.
So what's the real plan?
Two cops die tonight.
What about the Elf?
[Pollard] I'll kill her.
-You good? -[man] Yes, sir.
-Yeah. -Sarge?
You see my teeth? They're filed.
I'm not blooded, my father's not blooded, his father's not blooded.
I've been shit on by Orcs my whole fucking life.
Huh? You know what that feels like, when your own people hate you?
Why'd you lie, Nick?
It wasn't clan politics.
I just had the wrong guy.
Oh.
Story time?
[Jakoby] The guy that shot you, I lost him in the crowd.
I circled back, and I thought I had that fucking guy dead to rights.
But it was a different kid. He was just tagging.
And the troops are coming.
Jacked-up humans with guns looking for an Orc who'd shot a cop.
You think that kid had a chance?
Go, go, go!
They would've dropped him on the spot, so I did the right thing.
-Code four. -Clear.
You never saw his face. How'd you know it wasn't the motherfucker that shot me?
His fucking smell.
Yeah, years of evolution haven't taken away our sense of smell.
And he smelled different.
-What human jury would believe me? -What, he have Axe body spray?
Yeah, see, this is what I have to fucking deal with.
The Orc that shot you...
-got away. -Ward!
It's time.
"It's... time"?
Time for-- Time for what?
All four of 'em standing there?
-Yeah. -Your left to right, who is it?
Brown, Hicks, Pollard, and Ching. What's going on, Ward?
[rasps] Don't, don't, don't, don't--
[coughs] Don't.
Partner, no!
Drop it, or I will fucking kill you.
-[Pollard coughs] -[Jakoby] Hey, listen to me.
This isn't like you.
[Ward] All right, calm down.
-I know it looks bad. -Shut up. Shut up, show me your hands.
-I didn't have a choice, Nick. -Shut up.
Now turn back around!
[Ward] What's your plan?
[Jakoby] I'm...
I'm gonna arrest you, so... so shut up!
First of all, stop telling me to shut up.
Second, I need you to shut up
-and listen to me. -Shut up!
Turn around! Get on your fucking knees!
Gonna have to fuckin' kill me if you think you're gonna put me in handcuffs.
[groans, panting] Ward...
Three-Adam-9.
I got four officers down, one officer conscious and breathing.
Three officers...
KMA.
[dispatcher] All units, officer needs help, 341 Abrams.
Officer needs help, 341 Abrams.
-Roger on the RA. -[Jakoby] Oh, this is bad.
This is so bad.
-[sighs heavily] -Put your big girl panties on.
They were gonna kill us... over that Wand, all right?
They were acting crazy.
[Jakoby] Don't you say a word. Not to me, not to anybody.
[in Elvish] Jakoby? Jakoby, who are these people?
[Ward] Oh, shit. Put her in the truck. Put her in the truck.
[in Elvish] Keep the Wand safe!
Motherfucker, what?
[in Elvish] Protect the Wand.
Those cops there... they okay?
That's a lot of blood, homes.
That ain't none of your concern.
Maybe you should go over and give 'em a little mouth-to-mouth. Huh?
[Ward] This is an active crime scene.
We ain't never had no beef, Poison. Why don't you take your people home.
Word on the street, there's a Wand in this hood.
[man] Where's it at, man?
-My hood. -Altamira.
Alta-fucking-mira, eh?
[man] That's right.
So, when the little homies tell that the cops are shooting each other
in my hood...
makes me wonder. Hmm?
Where's the Wand?
Ghetto rumors, homie.
Don't wanna get shot in your face over a rumor, do you?
Why don't you go head home?
The Wand belongs to the people.
-To the barrio. -[Jakoby] Get back!
Homeboy.
-You heard me. -Sí mon.
[Poison] It's mine...
if I have to kill every fucking cop in LA.
You're gonna get your chance, 'cause SWAT is about 90 seconds out.
Nick, get in the truck.
Get in the fucking truck, Nick!
-Listen to your master. Get in the truck. -Fuck you.
-Fuck you, homie. -Fuck you.
What is that, a fuckin' Labradoodle you dipped in ink?
-[man] Messed with puerco, homie. -[Poison] Fucking ugly-ass motherfucker.
-[all chuckling, murmuring] -Looks like a puerco to me.
Get me that Wand.
Windows up, bulletproof.
-Is a SWAT team coming? -No, Nick. Go. Go!
-Wrong way, Nick. -Yeah, well, someone was on the car.
-[Tikka gasps] -Come back, you motherfucker!
-[Ward] Bulletproof, dickhead. -[man shouts]
[Ward] Go, go, go, go!
Let's get the fuck outta here. Drive like you stole it.
Altamira gang, homie. Let's get these motherfuckers.
[Ward] Go! Go!
Drive straight, not sideways!
[Ward] Shit, I'm out.
-Shit. -Butterfingers.
We were doing so good.
They don't teach that at the academy.
No, they do not.
[in Elvish] We have to turn back. Stop the car. Inferni!
-Inferni! Inferni! -Relax, relax.
-The hell is she saying? -[in Elvish] She won't let it go!
-[continues shouting in Elvish] -Oh, shit!
What's happening? Hey!
Hey, shut up! Shut up! What is that?
-[Tikka continues shouting in Elvish] -[Ward] Shut up!
-The fuck? -Problem?
Tech services is flagging some weird-ass cell phone inter...
Talking about a Magic Wand.
Help me. Help.
[whispers] Larika.
[breathes] Oh...
[in Elvish] Leilah. The traitor escaped.
She has your Wand.
I got blood in my eye. What the fuck did we hit?
Oh, that was the Wand.
You know what a binding spell is?
It stops it from getting too far away from its owner.
Pulls it back.
Owner? Who owns a Wand?
A Bright.
[in Spanish] Please, sir.
[in Spanish] Tell me what happened.
-Tell me. -[man gasps]
[in Spanish] Cops started shooting at each other,
and a black cop killed them all.
He left with an Orc cop and an Elf girl.
-An Elf? -[baby crying]
-[woman screams] No! No! -[overlapping shouts]
Okay, you know what? You need to sit your crazy ass down.
Look, half of our division is on some old-school Rampart shit, a'ight?
They're gonna kill you first, then they're gonna kill me,
they're gonna take the Wand,
and that's when the stupid shit's gonna start.
And by the way, that's only if the gangstas don't get it first.
And that's when the triple stupid shit's gonna start.
We gotta get out of this neighborhood.
Yeah, but the Wand is gonna stop us. The binding spell is gonna stop us.
We'll hide the Wand.
We'll hide it here and come back and get it.
I am not abandoning the Wand.
-We are not the fucking Wand police. -You want bodies on the street? Huh?
All of LA on fire?
This is like a nuclear weapon that grants wishes.
-[low chatter outside] -[Jakoby] No. The feds have people
that deal with magic.
-[stammers] We call them. We ask-- -You wanna call the feds?
I got bodies on my gun, remember?
Yeah, well, don't look at me, I just let an Orc go.
Really, Nick?
Really?
That was irony.
-No, that's just being an asshole. -Oh.
Gonna call Rodriguez. He's a sheriff, he's not LAPD.
-He's solid as fuck. We can trust him. -That's a good idea. -[low chatter continues] -Shh, shh.
-[in Elvish] They're coming for the Wand. -[whispers] Ah, shit.
-[Jakoby] What is it? -The lock.
We left the lock outside on the ground. Go.
-[man shouts in Spanish] -Partner, look out!
[Ward] Come on! Come on! Come on!
-[Tikka shouts] -[Ward] Let's go! Let's go!
Nick, let's go.
-Come on, let's go! -[Tikka shouts]
[Ward] What is your problem?
Wait! I dropped the Wand.
Don't you fucking touch that!
[Jakoby] Where did they all go?
I think we're breathing 'em.
-Hey, do me a favor. -Uh-huh?
Don't drop that shit no more.
What? No.
Why would I?
-[man shouts in Spanish] -[Ward] Ah, shit! Ah!
[whispers] Ward...
[stammers] I shot a human. Did you see?
Yeah, I'll get you some ice cream later. Damn.
-I'm hit. -[Jakoby] What?
They're not gonna stop. They're gonna keep coming. Let's go.
What are you doing here?
You fucking traitor.
Keep walking.
Tikka!
Where's Tikka?
Tikka!
On my back! Get on my back!
[in English] Get those fucking cops.
Tikka!
-Ward? -[gunshot]
-[grunts] -Ward!
You want some of this?
-[screaming] -I found Tikka. Let's go!
Tikka! Get down!
-[shrieks] -Ward, this way!
-Execute. -Sir.
-[man 1] Move! Let's go! Move! -[man 2] Confirmed use of magic.
She's Inferni.
What a shitshow.
You want to, uh, unpack this for me, boss?
[softly] Leilah.
Leilah was here.
What are you talking about?
She was sent to kill Tikka,
-then Tikka did that. -She wants her Wand back, right?
-Yes. -And Tikka has it.
-Yes. -And those cops she ran off with, uh...
-Ward and-- -[scoffing chuckle]
What? Jakoby.
The Orc cop we saw at the station.
They have no idea who Tikka is.
It's been 20 years.
What does that even mean?
Twenty years I've been hunting Leilah.
Without her Wand...
she's vulnerable.
[Jakoby] Now's a bad time to go shopping, Ward.
Everybody's looking for two cops. We gotta switch it up.
[Jakoby] Oh, yeah.
Running through a Fogteeth party is not good community policing.
Yeah, well, we're alive, and we got the Wand.
Orcs hold grudges. That's all I'm saying.
[Ward] Tell me about it. Hey, follow me. Let's go.
-[Jakoby] Tikka. -[gasps]
-Oh, thank you, ma'am. -Go.
-That's good. -Thank you.
Take your old lady, get the fuck outta here. Go. Go.
I need you to get the fuck outta here. All right? Go.
[woman] Jesus.
[man] Whoo!
Seven dudes with choppers down the right, five down the left.
Bunch of motherfuckers in the middle.
Officer Ward...
I think we need to talk.
Hey, Poison, how you doing?
[Poison] Some fucked-up shit went down tonight.
My homies wanna cut your fucking head off, the cops wanna cut your fucking head off,
the Fogteeth gang wanna cut your fucking head off.
Yeah, I got that effect on people, Poison.
Imagine how my old lady feels.
[Poison] Me? I just wanna protect you.
Mmm.
Get you home safe and sound, with all your sins forgiven.
But you gotta give me that Wand.
You wanna do the right thing?
Help me walk again.
Help me make love to my old lady again.
Help me get rid of this shit again.
Give me the fucking Wand, or I will nail every door in this place shut
and burn this place down to the fucking ground.
And then I will pick up the Wand from the ashes, and I will laugh.
Chopping it up with the homie for a sec, Poison.
I'm running out of patience, Officer Ward.
-Let's give this motherfucker the Wand. -What?
Look, we gonna get everybody in here killed,
and then he's gonna take the damn Wand anyway.
I'm not giving that guy the Wand.
Over my dead body.
He's gonna have to kill me first.
So you wanna die in a gunfight
in a nasty-ass titty bar?
That's what you want?
-[gasps] -[Jakoby] I don't wanna die anywhere.
You know what? Now I do. Fuck it. I wanna die. Let's do it right now.
We gonna titty-bar-gunfight die.
Let's do it right here, right now. Ready?
I just wish your dumb ass was a better shot.
-What she say? -She says the devil is coming.
The devil's ass is out there in that wheelchair.
-Let's go. On three. One... -Let's do it.
-...two... three. -Yeah.
Oh, shit.
-[gunfire continues] -Go, go, go!
Go! Go, go, go!
Move!
-[Ward] Go, go, go! -[Jakoby] Go, go, go!
[Jakoby] Hurry!
-LAPD! -[cops grunting]
-[Jakoby] Oh, fuck. Come on! -Who is she?
[in Elvish] Inferni! She wants her Wand.
Move!
[Jakoby] I'm not a cop after tonight, am I?
No. Neither am I.
I think we should probably spend our time
-just trying to survive this shit. -Survive?
[sighs] Being a cop is all I've got.
Right now I'm still a cop, and if I die tonight,
I'll be a cop forever. I'll be a...
I'll be a hero forever.
Why the fuck do you wanna die for a world that doesn't give a shit about you?
Orcs chose the wrong side a long time ago
and they've been paying for it ever since.
You know, when an Orc sees me...
they see a man... a wannabee human.
When humans see me, they see an animal.
They hate me.
[Ward] They don't hate you.
[Jakoby] We know when people like us and when they don't.
Like you, Ward.
When you came out of that house with pure hatred in your eyes.
Pure... hatred.
Look, I told you what that was, all right?
Why didn't you tell me the truth about helping the Orc kid?
I'm not saying it would've changed...
anything, but, shit, it might have.
I got confused.
And with humans, you understand, everything is so definite.
Like, you say something, and all of a sudden it's law,
and you can't walk it back.
You gotta tell me...
if I'm supposed to be your partner.
I don't care what we'll say to them, but you gotta tell me the truth.
You can't lie to me.
Oh, so I'm supposed to trust you when you don't trust me?
That's a good point.
You're a good cop.
And people are really hard on you, so...
you're really hard on yourself.
Come on, crazy.
Ward, do you know that you are who I wish I was?
You're fearless.
You always know what to do.
What you did tonight,
that's what it takes for an Orc to get blooded.
An act of great bravery.
To me, you're like a blooded human.
I used to be like you.
Think you can save everybody and fix everything and...
Now I just pretend to be a good dude.
You still are one.
Are we friends?
Nah, Nick. We're not friends, man.
You don't want me as a friend.
Show me your fucking hands, Ward.
Whoa, Rodriguez, what are you doing?
Show me your fucking hands.
-Hey! I called you. -Show me your fucking hands.
-Are you a part of this? -Part of what?
All I know is I heard chatter on the radio saying you killed a bunch of cops.
-Put your gun down. Listen, the guys-- -Shut the fuck up.
-[Jakoby] Hey! -Yo! Drop the weapon.
-Tikka, stop. All right. Relax. -Drop the fucking weapon!
Drop it now!
-Rodriguez. Listen to me. -Get away from the gun!
Listen!
The guys on our watch tried to do us over a Wand.
We have a Wand.
We have a Magic Wand.
-All right, show me the Wand. -Don't show him shit.
-He's gonna shoot us and take it. -Slow.
-[Ward] Jakoby! -[Tikka gasping]
Shit.
Okay, first thing we gotta do is keep that away from the bad guys.
-I'm gonna make a phone call. Put it down. -All right.
-Put it down. Now step back! -Rodriguez--
Step the-- God damn it! What the fuck? Is that an Elf?
-Rodriguez, put the phone down. -Step the fuck back!
-Put your phone down. -I'm calling the feds.
-It's what we're supposed to do. -Listen to me.
-Chill. Chill. Chill. -Listen. We don't know who's dirty.
-Rodriguez, put the phone down. -Shut the fuck up.
-Put the phone do-- -Hold on!
Don't tell 'em shit.
I got a deputy claiming to have the Wand.
Yes?
They wanna know where we're at.
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.
Who is this?
Who's this?
The motherfucker with the Wand.
[male Elf] You called us. Where are you?
All right, look...
I got the Wand, but I need something.
-You need forgiveness. -If I give you this Wand.
And let's just say...
I don't know, somebody accused me of, uh, some dumb shit, like...
killing a bunch of cops.
A man like you could fix that shit, right?
If you were protecting a weapon of magic from, let's say, corrupt individuals...
there would be no charges.
That's exactly what happened.
Hypothetically.
A man like you could dead that noise, right?
-[male Elf] Do you have the Elf girl? -[Ward] Yeah.
-[line clicks] -Yo.
-Can only narrow it down to a few blocks. -Okay.
Come on, let's go! Move out! Move out!
-The phone died. -Shit.
-All right, look-- -Okay. No, hold the-- Hold the fuck up.
-Hey, Rodriguez-- -Have to cuff your partner.
-Nobody's handcuffing anybody. -It doesn't look good.
A fucking Orc and a bunch of dead cops?
All right. What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
I'm just being real with you, man.
They want it to be Jakoby.
Okay? Whether it's him or not.
If he's not cuffed by the time they get here,
they're gonna smoke both of you motherfuckers.
-Cuff your partner. -Don't--
-Ward, it's okay. -Don't reach on me like that.
We can't run all night.
Let's do it.
-It's time to end this. -[thunder rumbling]
Let's go in.
-[Tikka speaks Elvish] -[Jakoby] Take my gun.
Turn around.
[Jakoby] Hey, Ward...
I can't go to prison.
They'll skin me alive.
You're not going to jail. You didn't do shit.
I shot everybody.
Ward, shut the fuck up and lawyer up.
-[gunshot] -Aah!
[Ward] Get inside! Get inside! Go!
-[all panting] -Shit. What was that?
Good girl. Let me out. Let me out. You see anything?
-[Jakoby] No, I can't see anything. -Sir, get away from that window!
-[Ward] Oh, shit! Move! Come on! -[all shouting]
[in Elvish] Traitor.
Oh, shit, shit.
[grunts] Get me out. Get me out.
Get me out!
-[panting] -[Jakoby] Oh, God.
-[tires screeching] -Oh, shit.
[Jakoby] I told you Orcs hold grudges. Huh? What'd I say?
All right, look. I'm gonna cut you a break on the reckless driving.
But I need you to return to your vehicles and drive home safely.
So I need you to take your fat Shrek-looking ass
back to your vehicle and drive the fuck home to Fiona. A'ight?
-Do you wanna go to jail? -[softly] Fiona?
Tell these dickheads in Orkish
to get the fuck back in their vehicles and drive home,
-or they're all going to jail. -But... they speak English.
But-- You understand, right? Speak English?
[overlapping in English] Yeah. Of course.
[male Orc] Take 'em to the church!
[in English] You know...
I'm not from here.
I grew up in Miami.
Great Orc communities there, strong Orc communities.
We'd have block parties with dwarves and humans.
[chuckles] It was fucking fun, man.
[exhales] I wasn't in the game then.
I was a bus driver.
Then I moved to LA.
Fucking City of Angels, right?
Listen, I would really appreciate it
if you gave me the respect of looking at me when I'm talking to you.
I get here and I see how broke the system is.
Orcs caught between the police and the gangsters.
Elves making money off us.
-So I organize... -[whispers] Tikka.
...my community.
We got our own thing now.
-[sighs] -Every month...
-Look at me, motherfucker. -[grunts] Sorry.
Every month...
I throw a big party.
Get everyone drunk, feed 'em.
All races...
partying together, with one rule.
No guns.
After years of peace...
who brings in the guns?
We did, yeah.
-The drama? -Us.
Disrespects our celebration?
The motherfucking police!
[in Orkish] An unblooded Orc.
Grew up with humans. Never had a hand raised for him in respect.
-What's he saying? -[Jakoby sighs]
-[leader in Orkish] Playing the nice guy. -Nothing I haven't heard before.
[in English] Your buddy's so happy to say he's got a Orc friend.
Shit. I'm stuck with this motherfucker.
-Seriously? -I'm just saying,
ain't like we's stomping through the club together.
Ward.
[in Orkish] Where is the Wand?
What Wand?
-[in English] Hey, man, we're family. -[Ward] Hey, Nick.
He's just trying to get in your head. Don't let him in your head.
I'm not trying to get in his head, man. I'm in his soul.
We're the same thing.
-I'll tell you where the Wand is. -Yeah?
It's up your fucking ass.
Where's the Wand?
Whip these motherfuckers.
-[male Orc] Get them! -[both groaning]
[leader] Don't hurt 'em.
Pussy.
-[in Orkish] Roundtooth. -[groans]
False Orc.
Unblooded coward.
Where is the Wand?
[in Orkish] What-- What Wand?
-[screaming] -You motherfucking dickhead!
-[gasping] -[in English] Where is the Wand?
[Jakoby in English] What Wa-- Wand?
There's no Wand!
Altamira thinks there's a Wand.
The police think there's a Wand.
The feds think there's a Wand.
I think there's a Wand!
[Ward] There's no Wand.
Ghetto Fairy tales.
[leader] Bring me the Elf.
I will cover you with her hot blood.
She don't have shit to do with this.
[leader] Where is the Wand?
We are police off--
officers.
And you can't do this to us.
[in Orkish] Kill them!
[in English] Watch your friends die, Elf.
[leader] You didn't break.
You deserve to be blooded.
You would have made a great Orc.
I am... a great Orc.
My son earns his colors tonight.
Mikey.
[whispers] Bye, partner.
[leader in Orkish] Why are you waiting?
Father... I know him.
[in English] Ward...
[Mikey in Orkish] He helped me escape from the police.
[in English] That's the guy...
that I let go.
He saved my life. I cannot kill him.
[in English] Go home.
You can't be here.
Fuck you, you green pig-nose piece of shit.
Shoot, bitch.
-Beg for it! Beg! -Shoot me, bitch. Shoot, bitch!
Fuck you.
-Show your respect! -Fuck you! Do it! Shoot!
-Shoot, motherfucker! Bring it! -Give us respect! Here it comes!
[in Orkish] This is a Prophecy, for he has risen.
[Ward gasps] Hey, hey.
[Jakoby stammers] W-Ward? What happened?
Uh... Nothing. Why?
Well, something happened. I feel great.
[Ward] Uh...
-[stammers] Nah, just go, go, go. -[Jakoby] Okay.
[Ward] You're a Bright?
You're a fucking Bright?
Would've been nice to know that when we was getting fucked up.
Could've had a magic helicopter take us somewhere.
[in English] I only started my training.
I only know a few spell words.
She speaks English pretty good now, too.
-Now I trust you. -[Ward] Um...
You gonna need to unfuck this, okay?
A'ight? You gonna magic us to Palm Springs or some shit.
I saved your friend's life.
Isn't that enough?
It's a start, but--
Uh, Ward, stop. I happen to think it's a pretty big deal.
Thank you.
Now, Tikka, who are these Elves who are hunting us?
They're aiding the return of the Dark Lord...
so he can slaughter billions
and enslave the survivors to serve him in a new age of magic.
Oh. That's all.
Just some Illuminati shit.
They're Inferni.
They destroyed the Illuminati a hundred years ago.
How do you know all this?
I, too, am Inferni.
But I escaped.
The Shield of Light hid me.
Leilah gave an assassin her Wand to kill me.
But I got the Wand from her.
Keep it away from Leilah.
She mustn't get her Wand back.
With it, she can restore the Dark Lord to power.
Hey, what is that? What's the shit? What's the black stuff?
-[coughing, gasping] -[Ward] Hey. Look-- All right.
All right, hey, look, don't-don't-don't check out on us.
[gasps] Keep it away from her. Keep the Wand away from Leilah.
-Promise me. -Yes.
All right. She needs medical attention. We gotta get her to an emergency room.
-[Jakoby] But how? -[panting]
Got it. Let's go!
Go, go!
We won't let you die.
How do we save you?
Only the Shield of Light can help me.
Where are they?
Home.
-Home. -[Ward] Home? Where's home?
Wait, home. [stammers] Uh... the Abrams' house?
Everybody was dead there.
There's a pool.
The pools are... connected like...
the roots of a holy tree.
Ward, she's dying. We have to take her back to where we found her.
-No. We are not going back to that house. -Yes.
We're gonna get to the hospital. There's doctors there.
We're gonna turn her and the Wand over to the feds.
-Ward. Ward. -I want my life back.
She brought me back from the dead.
Hey, don't kook out on me right now, all right?
We don't know exactly what happened.
You have to accept the miracle.
-We're not going back to that house. -You and me are simple people.
We mean nothing.
People don't write about us.
But this, don't you see, is like a time of heroes?
Jirak was unblooded like me.
An Orc that nobody cared about.
He...
He united the Nine Armies, and they defeated the Dark Lord. He...
He was a farmer who changed the world.
They raised their blades to him.
He was blooded in that very moment.
He fulfilled a great Prophecy, Ward.
I think we might be in a Prophecy.
-We're not in a Prophecy, all right? -How do you know?
We're in a stolen Toyota Corolla.
-No. -Okay? Look at my face.
-All right? This is not a Prophecy face. -[thunder rumbling]
This is a bad-night face.
Okay? And we're gonna get to the hospital,
and the feds are gonna put an end to it.
Shut the fuck up, Ward, and listen to me.
We have to go back.
There's nothing ahead of us.
[Ward] Ah, man. These guys are feds.
[Jakoby] Oh, shit.
[chuckles] I get the big gun.
Ah.
I didn't mind having the big gun.
[softly] That-- That's a bomb.
Yes, it is.
-You want me to hold it? -Yes, I do.
W... Why?
You never know.
[Leilah in Elvish, voice echoing] I sit before you, Lord of Darkness.
Serving your will is my honor.
I will return you to this world.
[gasps] They're coming! There! In the wall!
Shoot through the wall!
-[grunting] -Ward!
-Nick! [shouts] -[woman grunts]
-[grunts] -Nick! Let's go!
Jakoby!
I gave her the bomb.
You never know.
Swipe left.
[Ward] Oh, shit.
-[Ward] Shoot her! -[screaming]
-[continues screaming] -Shoot her!
Nick, will you please shoot her!
-Shoot! Shoot her! -[shrieking]
Good work.
-[Tikka] The water. Put me in the water. -[Jakoby grunts]
Hey. You're done. I got it from here.
So what now?
Have faith.
[whispers] She's coming.
Nick!
The hell are you?
I'm a warrior.
A priestess, a lover.
I am whatever my Lord needs me to be.
[Leilah in Elvish] Come home.
Please, come home.
-[Ward grunts] -[Tikka in Elvish] I can't go back.
Dream with me again.
What you love is broken, rotten.
[Leilah in English] This man and the Orc...
-[grunting] -...what are they to you?
-They're good. -[whispers] No.
-It's time to come home. -[whimpering sobs]
[Leilah] It's time to come home.
-[Tikka] It's too late. I can't come home. -[Leilah] It's time to wake up.
-[in Elvish] So just shut up and kill me. -[Leilah moans]
[in English] Just shut up and kill me!
-[Leilah] This is not you! -[Tikka] Shut up and kill me!
This is not you! This is you!
What have you done to my sister?
What have you done to her? What did you do?
Shit.
Nick, if you were aiming at the Wand, that was a really good shot.
But shoot her in her head!
Like this?
I can't.
I'm out. [sighs]
-[grunts] -[Leilah, echoing] No!
You're not a Bright.
You touch my Wand...
and it will splatter you all over the walls.
[Ward] I think that's kind of the plan.
Think I'mma just kill us all.
Ward...
I wouldn't do that.
It's all right.
We're in a Prophecy, right?
Oh... Oh!
This is impossible.
[Ward groans] Hey, Nick, I got the Wand.
Um, what now?
Maybe you're a-- You're a Bright, Ward.
Use it!
Oh, good idea.
Give it to me...
or she dies.
Vykwarus.
The war word is Vykwarus.
Vykwarus!
We got a Bright in there!
Aah!
Tikka. Tikka.
-Tikka! -Ward! It's okay.
-She just-- She rolled in. -Come on, Ward!
-She's gone. It's okay. -I didn't hurt her.
-Tikka! -Ward, Tikka's okay.
She's gone.
-Tikka! -Ward, think of Sophia.
Come on, Ward!
[man] Orc!
Stand down.
Stand down.
Ward!
Ward!
[Jakoby sobs] No!
Daryl!
You're safe now.
Ward!
[shouts] Daryl!
Ward! [gasping]
Ward!
[Jakoby] I know. I gotcha.
Got him!
Ward! [coughing] We made it!
We got out!
I got you. You're okay.
Are you okay?
[panting] Breathe, Ward.
Say something.
Nick... look.
Oh.
-[coughing] -[Ward] Still not my friend.
I never really liked you anyway. [coughs]
Think you're a big dog now you're blooded, huh?
-[approaching sirens] -Yeah, pretty big.
Hey, Nick.
[Jakoby] Yeah.
[Ward] Fuck magic.
[Jakoby] Well, I don't know. I still think it's kinda cool.
[man] How you doing, fellas?
-Good? -[Ward] Hey.
-Nick, the firemen are here. -[Jakoby grunts]
-[Ward] We should've been firemen. -[Jakoby] Yeah.
-[Ward] Hey, can I get a aspirin? -[Jakoby grunts]
Hey, Clan Blood.
Daryl.
Oh, Daryl.
How are you feeling?
You feeling okay?
Uh, yeah.
Okay, I get it.
Oh, shit.
Well, that can't be good.
Yeah.
Why you not locked up?
I think they think you're more dangerous than me.
[Ward] Hey.
Don't say shit.
-Sir, we were just responding to a call. -[Ward] Mmm.
My partner and I, we-- But there was all this crazy magic stuff.
I mean, everything that happened with Brown...
-Hey, hey, hey. -...and Hicks and Pollard and Ching--
-They wanted Officer Ward to shoot me. -Hey. Nick.
They wanted to him to kill me so they could get the Wand, remember?
And he wouldn't do it 'cause he's a stand-up guy.
He wouldn't do it. But then they said they would kill me, so he--
he had to take action,
-like, with his gun, right? -No. That's not my recollection.
-[sighs] -Hey, Nick, why don't you just--
If you hold up a second...
-What? -...they'll ask us questions.
It's what happened, I swear to God. We just returned to the call.
But there are forces at play that are beyond.
-There was, uh, an Elf woman. -Hey, Nick.
She owned the Wand. Right?
It must've been hers. Not a nice lady. Dressed very well, but-- Like you.
But she was a terrible woman. She--
-Uh, she served the Dark Lord. -Nick--
-I know it. -Let them--
-Let them ask us questions. -They need to know this.
-Let him ask us questions. -There was an Angel.
All right. That was then when the gangsters were chasing us.
-[Ward] Uh, the context is a little off. -[Jakoby] Tikka.
Oh, Tikka. [tsks]
So sad. [stammers] Tikka-- Tikka was a young Bright.
She-- She-- She--
She-- She used the Wand and she saved my life.
I was-- My soul was leaving my body, and she brought me back.
Officer Ward?
We responded to a 415 disturbance call.
Uh, upon approaching the residence, we realized that it was a safe house
-for an extremist group. -Full of weird--
We immediately took fire,
uh, at which point we called for backup.
And... unfortunately...
-officers were killed in the exchange. -I've never seen shooting like it.
He turned around, sight unseen,
four of them, bang, bang, bang, bang. Dropped...
like it was one bullet.
Sorry, keep going.
Gangsters showed up,
and it just went really sideways from that point.
And had you guys not shown up...
it would've-- it would've been really bad.
Uh, so the real heroes in this are you guys.
So we wanna say thank you.
Nick, thank the nice federal agents.
Thank you.
So, let me say, unequivocally...
there was no Wand.
And there was no magic.
Just a couple of street cops...
doing our job.
[softly] Oh, I know what this is.
Then that's what happened?
Yes, sir. That's exactly what happened.
Yes?
No, I'm with him.
Unequivocally. [soft grunt]
Faced with armed terrorists obsessed with myths from thousands of years ago,
two of our officers held the line.
[softly] I hate seeing those scumbags up there with Rodriguez.
[whispers] Let it go, Ward.
We know, okay? That's enough.
Officer Daryl Ward, and our nation's first Orkish police officer, Nicholas Jakoby.
Hand-off was clean. No stops till the exit point.
Clear roads all the way, chief.
Just as you predicted.
Thank you for agreeing to an earlier departure time, Mr. Kurosawa.
I'm honored, you and your wives have entrusted a Triple A Protection service today.
Moving red to green option, coming in on your vector.
Get the engine started, I want an immediate takeoff.
-Air space has already been cleared. -Roger that.
All channels moving to restricted air space.
Shall we?
Mr. Kurosawa...
Safe travel.
Thank you so much, Michael.
-Another Triple A delivery, sir. -Stay with him till he's airborne.
-Yes, sir. -Canvas is clear?
Nothing for miles, chief. Almost boring.
And what's our motto?
Boring is always best.
Move! Move!
Client down! Client down!
Code seven!
Jesus!
It's like a goddamn milkshake in here!
Bravo 1 down.
We need a clean-up team in here now!
Repeat, Bravo 1 down.
Fucking piece of paper I've got here.
I'm gonna beat this motherfucker's...
Holy shit.
Mr. Seifert.
-Are we ready to go? -"Are we ready?"
I've been waiting!
What the hell took you so long? It's half past nine!
Apologies. I'd to make some preparations. Mr. Seifert!
It's best if I go through doors first.
-Okay? -Okay.
Don't think you know what I'm dealing with here.
-Let's go. Double time. -You don't understand.
These people are animals!
They're probably here already, just waiting for me to leave.
I appreciate your concern, but I assure you, you're perfectly safe.
All you need to do is exactly what I tell you.
Mr. Seifert? This way, please.
All right. Is it not enough cocaine, or too much?
They say you're Triple A rated.
Is that a real thing?
Let's just... focus on you dying of natural causes, shall we?
Soon.
That's my car.
Take a mental picture of it.
I find it safer if we're using a car that blends in with the surrounding traffic.
Well, that was easy. In fact, practically nothing at all.
Boring is always best.
I trust you'll reduce your...
-What? -This is Michael Bryce.
I'm an Executive Protection Agent, fully licensed and bonded within the EU.
Fuckin' hell. I know it's you. I've got caller ID!
Such a fucking dick. You got a pickup for me or what?
Yes. I've extracted my client from 27 Saint George street.
Clean-up is required.
On the seventh floor, north stairwell,
I've left a French national employed by the Taray Crime syndicate.
You'll find two more in the south stairwell.
On the roof, you're gonna find another who's gonna need some dental work.
In the alley, there's two gentlemen who may require some counseling.
One more in the east office on the sixth floor under construction
and one on the number three elevator.
Parking garage, under the Rolls-Royce in space five,
a pound of plastic explosives,
so you might wanna call the bomb squad.
Check that. Make it the fire department. Is that my car?
I'm afraid so. Have a seat, it's been a long day.
That was a custom Rolls-Royce, one of a kind.
I thought that was an unusual color. Was that periwinkle?
I did find this in the backseat.
-Scraps! -Precious, aren't they?
-It smells like ass in here. -Buckle up.
This car certainly isn't Triple A rated.
It's not even fit for animals.
Keep moving!
Everybody go home!
Get out of the way!
Have a look there.
I apologize for such an unexpected late visit, Professor.
You're always welcome, Mr. President.
In your house with soldiers, yes.
In your classroom, I've been told I'm less popular.
Nothing is more important than a good education.
Knock on the doors.
How's your English?
I don't know much English, Mr. President.
"The only way for the country to progress
is by eradicating the scourge of genocide
blackening our country and our livelihood."
I appreciate your modesty.
I hope we're not... disturbing your family.
They are on holiday.
Oh, good for them.
Family makes a man whole.
I could have you executed for treason,
but another would simply stand a little bit higher on your corpse.
There must be some other lesson I could teach you.
As I said...
there is nothing more important...
than a good education.
Prof. Asimov,
can you please tell the court what happened next?
Then... I was taken to one of Dukhovich's internment camps.
I was there for three years...
until he was finally overthrown.
Arrested like the monster he is.
Thank you, Prof. Asimov.
Your Honor, I request that this entire testimony be disregarded.
Without any evidence, this is merely hearsay.
Sustained.
The trial of former Belarusian President Vladislav Dukhovich continued today
with emotional testimony from many of his country's victims.
But while powerful to hear, Dukhovich's attorneys say
they're nothing more than the lies of his enemies.
Long one of the world's most brutal dictators...
Who stands accused of ethnic cleansing on a massive scale.
An unprecedented level of security is in place around the courthouse.
Even the airspace above this city is closed.
So far, the prosecution has been crippled
by the lack of any hard evidence against Dukhovich himself.
Numerous witnesses who were expected to testify have disappeared.
Is there anyone brave enough to come forward with evidence and finally put an end to his brutal reign?
Mr. Kincaid, this is lnterpol's offer.
In return for your testimony against former President Dukhovich,
your wife will receive a full pardon from all jurisdictions.
You're going to pardon an innocent woman?
That's mighty fucking white of you.
Assuming we accept this arrangement for Sonia Kincaid,
there's still the matter of an agreement regarding my client.
He will receive
this letter recommending leniency.
Mr. Kincaid is a contract killer
facing two dozen counts of murder in ten countries.
Absent a legitimate deal,
he will never breathe free air again. Under no...
Sonia goes free.
We're all set, Director Casoria.
Let's get this gentleman to the Hague.
Mr. Kincaid, this is Agent Roussel.
She'll be leading a security detail, which will escort you to the International Criminal Court.
You know, Dukhovich's men have killed every single witness brought against them,
and my security detail is a dozen off-duty cops?
These are the most highly-trained officers in Europe, Mr. Kincaid.
We have taken every precaution to make sure that your involvement is completely classified.
Oh, it's a secret?
That makes me feel so much better.
Well, I can assure you,
even if there was an attempt, we're more than prepared for any assault.
Prepared for that assault, motherfucker?
Uncuff me, give me some car keys, a couple guns, I'll meet you guys there.
The court's deadline is at 5 p.m. tomorrow, Mr. Kincaid.
That gives us 27 hours to transport you from Manchester to the Netherlands.
If you want to help your wife, you should get moving.
Okay, Inspector Clouseau,
let's see what these elite troops of yours can do.
Come on, guys, let's go.
Agent Roussel,
I don't have to remind you of the importance of this.
-No, ma'am. -And don't doubt what he's capable of.
I won't, sir.
-Take a left on Kirkland Avenue. -Yes.
What a pretty little town.
Old, narrow streets, buildings nice and close,
lots of great views from all those windows.
This route's been wiped clean for us. Nothing to worry about.
Is that right?
How's that nose of yours doing?
Take a diversion route.
Got a boyfriend, Roussie? Significant other?
I need you to be quiet, Mr. Kincaid.
I'm just saying, now might be the perfect time
to write one of those "I'll always love you" texts.
Relax, motherfucker. If you hear the shot, it wasn't meant for you.
Two-two-one, ten-four en route.
-Fuck! -Cover me!
Move! Move!
Cover me!
Move! Go! Get that door open!
Go! Alpha Squad, with me! Agent Roberts, protect the witness!
Parker, take the left flank!
Shit! We need more backup!
Follow me!
Fuck!
Agent Roussel!
Goddamn it! Somebody! We need backup--
Turn around!
-It's ready! -Come on!
Lay down some cover fire.
Fuck!
-Show me your hands! -Bitch, please!
-Put these on. -Fuck that.
Interpol's compromised. You know that.
Either you shoot me or watch me bleed out.
-We gotta get off the street. -There's a safe house not far from here.
As a car bomb has exploded in Bishopgate Green, near Coventry City Center...
Don't even think about answering that fucking phone!
The only way Dukhovich could've known our route was if he had somebody on the inside.
Now, I need medical supplies, and you need help.
So, if you're gonna call somebody, they have to be totally out of the loop.
I've had the Black Diamond service four times now, you understand?
Four times. The car still smells like a cemetery.
Are you washing the car with old assholes?
Or...
Just help me to understand.
Just a second here.
Hello, Amelia.
I'm texting you an address in Coventry.
You need to get there immediately. Bring three units of O-negative blood.
I'm doing very well, thank you. How are you?
I don't have the time for this, Michael. I have a job I need you to do.
-Pass. -I wasn't offering. I'm telling you.
I have a job you're going to do.
I'm not gonna let you charm me into this one, Amelia.
Okay, let's be clear.
I'm not any happier about this than you are, but I don't have a choice.
Well, thank God, I do. No, Michael, you don't.
'Cause if you're not where I need you to be,
I'm going to expose you and your work to Interpol.
That elite Triple A status you want back so badly...
-I'll make sure you never get near it. -You threatening me now?
Not you, her. Are you threatening... You can't threaten me into taking orders from you.
I guess we'll find out. You're three hours away. I'll see you in two and a half.
Three... Okay. I guess we will. Jesus Christ.
Here, we're gonna load all these into the car, okay?
We're gonna take the car out in the front, and then burn it.
This place is like a war zone.
We got bodies everywhere. Our unit's compromised. Everyone's down.
Get those guys ID'd.
And I've got no sign of Agent Roussel.
Maybe 15 to 20 dead mercenaries, heavily armed.
Media circus is in town. That's not the worst of it.
Kincaid is gone.
Coventry, every available agent.
Report back to me with any updates.
Yes, ma'am.
There must've been a leak.
I told you, there are too many agencies involved.
Get to the Hague. See what you can get out of Dukhovich.
I'll try.
And alert the penitentiary in Amsterdam.
Have them triple the guard around Kincaid's wife.
Got it.
Mrs. Kincaid, your attorney.
Did I tell you you could turn around?
What do you want, you useless piece of shit?
Oh, baby. Baby, it's me.
My bad.
What do you want, you fucking hijo de puta motherfucker!
I just wanted to hear your voice.
Fuck you!
There, you heard my voice.
The only reason I'm in this shit hole is so that they can get to your sorry ass!
How you doing? Made a shank yet?
What for? It's prison, baby. You gotta protect yourself.
It's a Dutch prison, Darius! What are they gonna do, beat me with a clog?
Oh, you got a view at least?
Just a whole lot of corny Dutch buildings.
There's one with a huge fucking clock on it.
Like that's what I need right now. Do they have those flowers you love?
Irises? They come from there, right?
Fucking tulips, Darius.
What kind of a piece-of-shit husband doesn't remember his wife's favorite flowers?
You never remember anything. What's our anniversary?
I'm gonna make this up to you, baby.
You see, that's what I'm talking about, cabron.
Darius, is something wrong?
Not a thing, baby.
Not a fucking thing.
Then I wanna hear it.
-Hello? -Hello?
-Sonia? -Darius!
You fucking piece of shit!
You fucking shit!
Go ahead, you might as well finish the job.
Why am I here, Amelia?
A high-value transport.
High value?
I don't... I don't really do high value anymore. These days I'm more in the...
I don't really do high value anymore. These days I'm more in the... Mid-level coked-out attorney market.
Why do you think that is?
-Seriously, Michael? -Because of you.
You used me to climb the Interpol ladder and here we are again.
You up for a promotion?
You blame me for every little bump in your road, don't you?
No, these aren't bumps. No bumps.
Just one dead Japanese arms dealer.
-I had nothing to do -...to do with.
Do you know what happens
when a Triple A rated Executive Protection Agent loses a client?
Triple A. I was up here, yeah?
Then I opened up to you. Why wouldn't I? I was in love with you.
And I fucking told you his name.
It was the first time in my entire career I revealed a client's name.
I trusted you.
Now I'm down here. The dead guy's up here.
I'm sorry, Michael, you hit a rough patch.
"A rough..."
A 300-pound investment banker's ass exploded four bags of heroin in the backseat of my car last week.
Those aren't leather seats, those are cloth.
Okay, Michael...
Take a minute to grab a mental image -of what that clean-up might be. -...the time for your insane shit, okay?
And at a certain point, you sell the car.
-I never used you! I just left you! -The depreciation is so much...
'Cause you couldn't forgive me for something I didn't even do.
Transport is in there.
Is that blood, dude...
What the fuck?
You know how long I've been waiting for this?
No. I'm not gonna look.
Motherfucker!
Whoa! Hey! Whoa! Let's talk about this, okay?
Even a dumb-ass like you is smart enough to keep one in the... pipe.
Oh, shit.
And nighty night.
-Darius Kincaid. Jesus Christ. -Michael!
This is who you want me to protect? Look at my shirt!
-Shut up for two seconds! -Fine.
You get the feet, I'll get the nostrils.
The trial of former Belarusian President Vladislav Dukhovich
took an uncertain turn this week, having recently survived
a dioxin poisoning attempt that left his face disfigured.
Authorities are keeping Dukhovich... Interpol wishes to have a word.
Quite the dustup in Coventry this morning.
You wouldn't know anything about it, would you?
You've come here to lodge a complaint?
I've come for my money. I delivered as promised.
I gave you Kincaid as exposed as you'll ever get him.
Small security detail, practically a rookie leading them.
I can't do more than that. Let's be fair here.
You think it's fair that you want something for nothing?
In my country...
we would skin you like a cat.
Would that be fair?
I come from nothing. I work all my life...
Serving the people.
And then they come into my country and they took it all away!
And now they lock me up like a rat, feed me poison!
Is this fair?
When Kincaid is dead...
you'll be paid in full.
You know he's a murderer, right? You're playing nurse to a murderer.
-A witness. -Really?
Twenty-seven times.
That's how many times this asshole has tried to kill me, 27... Twenty-eight! Fucking Prague!
If Dukhovich is acquitted, he'll be back in power next week.
-I won't let that happen. -Good.
You should take him to the Hague.
I can't! There's a mole inside Interpol.
-It's already cost me 12 good officers. -Good?
That's subjective. Nice. Maybe they were nice.
I'll make it simple for you; If I stay near him, they'll find him.
So I gotta risk my life protecting this coffin magnet over here?
No. You gotta put something in the pot. How about your career?
-How about it? -Your precious career.
You do this job for me...
and I'll get you back to elite status.
Yeah, you don't have that power.
I've got connections.
Want back in the big game? I can put you there. Why would I trust you?
Why?
'Cause I've never lied to you, Michael.
You're terrible at almost everything,
but you're good at keeping people alive.
Keep him alive... please.
And you get your dream life back.
And as bonus, you'll never hear from me again.
-Good. -Yes.
It hurts.
I don't speak French. -Still. -Shame.
-Still. -Shame.
Shit.
Where are you?
Setting up operation at Coventry Police Headquarters.
-You got nothing from Dukhovich? -Are you surprised?
-Ma'am? -Busy.
Yes, but I've picked up activity -at our safe house in town. -Is it something I should know right now?
No, not normally. But, yes, it should be vacant.
And you believe it's not?
Well, the access code was activated without identity authorization.
Could Kincaid have gotten inside?
But it's on a revolving encryption.
Get a team over there. Now!
And where is Agent Roussel?
Sorry, got to go. Good luck.
I believe I know where Kincaid is.
I know this Darius Kincaid we're talking about. I want proof he's dead.
Proof? Like a photo?
Like a head.
What the fuck is all this?
You're a fugitive.
-Fugitives wear restraints. -No, not the cuffs.
I'm talking about these whack-ass, hipster clothes I'm wearing.
-Yeah, luckily I brought extra. -Lucky for who?
Oh shit. Am I wearing underwear?
Those are for me too, in case I have to change your pants again.
Not a fan. You know they call them swinging dicks for a reason.
How about we never speak of this again?
Shit. Interpol protocol.
When that phone rings and nobody answers, they're gonna send officers to the door.
And there they are.
Yes, we're setting our perimeter.
Comfy?
So, what happened to little Miss Interpol?
Agent Roussel's gone.
Oh damn! I liked her. She's spunky.
This building has two stairwells, no fire escapes...
No fire escapes and no adjacent rooftops.
You're not the only observant motherfucker on the planet.
I go through doors first.
I check to see if it's clear, then you follow.
Really? You think that's necessary?
-My job is to keep you out of harm's way. -Shit, motherfucker.
I am harm's way.
Split up and take different floors.
Two hostiles, maybe more.
I don't suppose I could have a gun?
No. We'll take the north stairwell. Let's go.
No. Fuck!
-It's him! -Come on!
Oh! Thank God you're here. Don't know what I would do without you.
Well done. Guess what happens now?
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Go! Go!
All units sending in nine-nine.
Now we have a new problem.
I like to keep things a little more subtle.
Quick, they're heading for the roof.
See? Boring is better.
Okay. That's very loud.
It was empty anyway.
We're identifying heat signatures on the rooftop moving in a northbound direction.
Copy that! Go! They're on the roof!
No. No odds in that jump.
Beats the hell out of whatever will come through the door.
No. Just gotta...
We just gotta find a more intelligent way...
Motherfucker! Shit!
Shit!
Holy fucking shit.
Secure the roof! Go! Delta Squad with me!
-They're on the north side! -Copy that!
Made that jump on one leg.
I made that jump without jumping. Let's go.
So, what's your next trick? Showing me how we escape without escaping?
Let's just try to get to the car without killing anyone, all right?
-Is this your car? -One of them.
-Is this your car? -One of them. I remember shooting at you in a Jaguar.
Buckle up. If we get in a high-speed chase, I want you strapped in.
I'm more worried about the wheels coming off this bitch when you reach the speed limit.
You know, back in the day, we wouldn't have even stolen this piece of shit, and we stole everything.
-I remember one night... -I know all I need to know about you.
All your early arrests,
your father in and out of prison, you following in the same footsteps.
Did your little research, did you? Prepare for a test, there are no surprises.
And you grew up wanting to be a cop
till you found out wasn't no money in that shit.
So you joined the CIA, sharpened your skills,
then decided to open your own shop, pimp yourself out to the fat cats.
I didn't even have to do no research to know that shit.
It's written all over your punk-ass.
Can't wait to hear what I'll do next. That's great.
You know, why don't...
Why don't you lay back and keep from getting spotted?
-Get comfortable. -That's a good idea.
Smells like ass back here!
Bet that Jag never smelled like ass.
These your electrolytes?
Darius has gone.
Nothing but cops out here.
Facial recognition identifies this man as Michael Bryce.
But you already know that, don't you, Agent Roussel?
You two have a history.
Long time ago.
You slipped Kincaid into our own safe house, then brought in this...
Executive Protection Agent?
Official channels had been compromised. What did you expect me to do?
Clearly, our office security's been breached.
The red notice stays. You, however, can go.
I'm placing you on leave.
You'll surrender your weapon and credentials.
You're going to be telling this story for years, Amelia,
from inside a very large office
or a very small cell.
Well... I like my odds.
The only way Bryce and Kincaid don't make it to the Hague is if they kill each other first.
Amelia.
She's making a mistake.
We need to plug our leak.
Now, this Bryce, do you trust him?
With something like this, yes.
I'll speak to Casoria, get her to allow you to come to the Hague with us.
But no more secrets.
Thank you, sir.
Search for car, plate FJ56MHV.
They'll have identified the car with the traffic cams by now.
-And you. Welcome to fugitive life. -Until I turn you in.
Just need to find a different vehicle,
older model, no alarm. Right here.
Luckily, I came prepared.
If you're gonna be a while, I can go in there and get a room.
There's an art to low-impact, high-efficiency breaking and entering,
but...
Art's subjective.
And you're bleeding again.
For a dude that runs around killing people, you've got this really strange thing about bleeding.
It's inefficient. And I don't kill people, I protect them.
Hector Ramirez.
Hector Ramirez was an assassin.
Yeah, I know. I trained him.
Who was holding a knife to my client's throat. -And you killed him. -No.
-And you killed him. -No. I saved my client.
I think Hector might have a different perspective on that.
Is that so? Here's the thing.
I was a Triple A rated Executive Protection Agent.
-You just made up that Triple A shit. -No, I did not!
And if guys like you, if sociopaths like you,
weren't running around trying to kill my clients, no one would get hurt.
Triple A, yeah. Sounds like you ought to be selling life insurance or fixing my fucking transmission, or something.
Well, you're uninsurable, trust me.
And you said "was."
-"I was a triple A, x-rated dickhead!" -I said "am." Get in the fucking car! Get in the fucking car!
Jesus fucking Christ.
You definitely said "was."
"Was" as in,
"I used to be a Triple X dickhead driving a Jag,
but now I'm rolling around in this shit-wagon."
Put your seat belt on.
What happened? Lose your edge?
Drop focus?
-You slip up and let a client get popped? -Never slipped up.
Well, how did "am" become "was"?
I don't actually know.
I mean, how does a so-called expert assassin get busted by Interpol?
Love, baby. Straight-up love.
See, I'm doing this job in Geneva, right? Some dude washing the wrong dude's money.
I get a call.
What?
My wife's been in a car accident, bad one. What?
So, Geneva dude gets a pass, I jet back to Mexico City,
go straight to the hospital. Bopped up in Sonia's room, two dozen Agents waiting for me.
Bopped up in Sonia's room, two dozen Agents waiting for me.
Played by the heart.
Happens to the best of us, man.
Sort of like how Agent Roussel took you from here
to here... to here.
Oh! Assassin and eavesdropper. You're a real double threat.
You were whining like a bitch so loud, I heard you through the wall.
Agent Roussel and I aren't any of your concern.
So, she dumped you 'cause of all your tight-assed,
"boring is good, look before you leap, put your seat belt on" shit?
She didn't dump me.
Motherfucker, I know she dumped you.
I'm just perusing all the reasons why,
and there's a plethora of those motherfuckers.
-Plethora? -Yeah. It means a lot.
I know what plethora means! It just doesn't apply here!
And not jumping off the top of a roof, that's logical, that's safe.
You know, wearing a seat belt. Logical, safe.
Let me ask you something. How many times have you been shot?
-Counting today? -Yeah.
-Too many to count. You? -Yeah, I bet.
-Zero. -Now, we both know that's bullshit.
That's not bullshit, okay? This was a little flesh wound.
You just kinda zinged it right there.
Didn't even require a band-aid. You got lucky.
Yeah, the rock shifted just as I took the shot.
You lucky motherfucker.
-Fuck! -Fuck!
Fucking Prague.
Yeah, Prague.
-You never even took one for a client? -Nope. Never had to.
Yeah, but the question is, would you?
See, if I pay Triple A rates,
then I'm looking for that full-service shit, you know what I'm saying?
That extra "a" stands for "ass,"
yours, between mine and a bullet.
Being prepared for everything
means that that situation statistically just won't occur.
You cannot be prepared for everything! Life is gonna bloody us up, okay?
You just gotta put a band-aid on that shit and keep rolling!
That's really beautiful, man.
You ever write stuff down? Throw down a haiku or two?
How'd you like that, motherfucker?
Do you have any idea how stupid you sound? I mean, what a fuckup!
You lost my husband, and you're like, "Can you please help us find him?"
Why the fuck should I?
That is your fucking job, motherfucker!
But, obviously, you suck at it.
You received a phone call today from your attorney.
So?
Well, we asked your attorney,
but... he said he didn't have any contact with you.
What?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Okay, that's it! I've had it with this lawyer!
He's an alcoholic. He calls me completely drunk.
And he starts saying the most inappropriate things.
Like, for example, what he likes to do to his wife's ass.
That is a disgusting place to hide a child's toy!
And you know what? I don't need to listen to this shit!
Then he forgets about it, but I'm stuck with the images in my head!
Mrs. Kincaid.
If you know where your husband is, you need to tell us.
It's for his own safety.
I'm sorry...
You're worried about my husband's safety?
No one in this world can kill Darius Kincaid.
The man is a cucaracha,
and I mean that in every sense of the word.
Sometimes you just wanna crush his little, filthy head with your shoe,
but he won't die.
That motherfucker is unkillable, so you can relax.
But wait, no.
There is one important thing you should know.
I shit on your whore of a mother. Motherfuckers, get out of my fucking cell.
-Great. -Now!
And I want that lawyer fired!
I want that lawyer fired! I want a good one, professional lawyer!
I have rights! Human rights!
Okay, you can take a five-minute break.
Good evening.
-Can I help you? -We need to see your cameras.
Sorry, sir, that's for management only.
The others have picked up a signal.
I got you!
Where we at?
I backtracked west.
West is the wrong direction.
Thank you. They'd expect us to take a direct route.
-The fuck is that you're eating? -Postpones fatigue.
-The fuck is that you're eating? -Postpones fatigue. Refuels glycogen and electrolytes. I got you one, too,
while you were taking one of your world-class naps.
I'd stay awake if you let me drive.
Thank you. That's really generous of... No!
I gotta piss.
Use that. Timeline's not built for another break.
Your dick might fit in here, but mine...
Plus, I need every drop of this shit to tolerate this ride with you.
Just pull the fucking car over.
Jesus Christ.
It'd be a lot easier without these cuffs, or this fucking underwear.
Hey, asshole!
Fucking goddamn it, that's not mud!
You think I'm a fucking idiot?
Well...
You did think that cheap whiskey was piss.
-Oh! -Fuck!
Where the hell did that come from?
This is what happens when you mess with a perfectly laid plan.
-Give me a gun. Give me a goddamn gun! -I got this!
There's more than one. Ah! Perfect deduction, Sherlock.
Draw their fire so I can take a look.
-All right. -Go!
Three shooters in a row, all lit up.
So, what do you wanna do?
While you can't come up with a plan, they'll come down here and kill us.
So here's the plan.
-What the fuck? -You take eleven o'clock, I'll take one.
Let's see who gets to twelve first.
Okay. On three. You ready?
One...
-I said on three. You shot early. -Yeah, before they did.
Let me break it down...
So much for your intricately calculated travel plans.
That's why I was trying to bounce on your ass. See, I'm safer on my own.
No way they could've known where we were.
Well, they did, and now they're dead.
This yours? Is it your cell phone?
I might've taken that off some dead merc.
You might've...
You know, they can track a cell phone.
That's why I use a ghost chip in mine, so they can't track the phone.
That's how they know where we were!
Here I am, I'm plotting courses all over the country,
and you're carrying a location beacon in your pocket!
-My bad. -Your bad?
You don't even understand how 21st century technology works!
How have you stayed alive this long?
While all you guys are wasting your time planning and aiming and deducing,
I just do my thing, and my thing has always been better than your fucking thing.
Great. There you go.
That's just great.
I'm glad your thing has always been better than mine.
You won't take this gun?
No, you keep that gun. Use it to shoot me.
No, I was gonna shoot you with this--
Shit!
There go the guns. Well, look on the bright side.
We get the bad guys' van.
This field smells like your car.
Dude, I said I was sorry about the phone.
Who knows, maybe your plan would've worked.
-So, what about your other plan? -There's no plan!
The plan is we're in a cow pasture, that's the plan.
I'm talking about your Agent Roussel plan.
That's why you're doing this, right? Get her back?
You think becoming a Triple A card-carrying dickhead
is gonna give you an all-access backstage pass to Agent Roussel's ass.
-And she'll fall in love with you. -I get it. I got it.
You'll be the guy that the other inmates come to for advice. They're very lucky.
Motherfucker, please.
I've eaten hamburgers that know more about women than you.
-You, my friend, are a romantic retard. -Hey!
Just 'cause I wanna get my business back in order, that doesn't make me a shitty person.
And Amelia has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with this.
Oh, man. You are so in love, it is crazy.
Christ, do you ever shut up?
Why is everything always about love with you?
Well, what else is there?
I mean, take away the guns, the money, the travel,
the perfect shot through a motherfucker's earhole from 300 meters.
None of that shit means dick if I can't tell Sonia about it.
I guess Amelia's just not as special as Sonia.
She sounds great.
-What, she cheat on you? -No.
-Try to kill you? -No.
'Cause Sonia chopped off part of my ear with a machete one time.
She sewed it back on, but...
It was two, three days before our shit got real again.
-Where'd you guys meet, Christian Mingle? -No. A bar in Honduras.
One of those places where nobody knows your face and name.
I'd just come off a job.
Some dude kidnapped the wrong dude's daughter.
I was sitting there chilling,
when I noticed this waitress getting hassled by these guys.
I got up to help her, when she unleashed
the most amazing display of violence and beauty...
I had ever seen.
When she severed that dude's carotid artery with a beer bottle,
I knew.
I knew right then.
We slow danced all night.
She sounds like she's gonna make a good mother someday.
Lights.
-Need a ride? -Yeah.
We're trying to catch a ferry to Amsterdam.
-Yeah, I can get you there. -Yeah?
-Jump in. -Oh, hey, hey.
There's eyes all over Amsterdam for me. That's where Sonia's locked up.
It's a quick in and out. I got a place there.
-You got a place in Amsterdam? -Yeah.
-Is that where you keep the Jag? -You know what?
Why don't you go fuck yourself and the horse you... Hello.
Hello, beautiful sisters.
Whose lap will I sit on?
Here's the phone.
Ivan says Kincaid is still on the move.
If God wishes a man dead...
Ivan will find him.
And if God's not ready for Kincaid to die?
Make sure the back-up plan is in place.
One more!
Your stop, boys!
You take care, sisters.
Bye, Kincaid!
Go with God!
This man's killed over 150 people.
Two-fifty, easy.
Yeah, but they love you. Me, they wanna perform an exorcism on.
Question for a higher power.
Who is more wicked,
he who kills evil motherfuckers
or he who protects them?
You really believe you're the good guy?
My first contract... I was...
I don't know, 16, 17.
There was a guy who broke into a church.
The preacher was still there, so he told the guy,
"Look, you don't have to steal anything, take whatever you want."
Dude wasn't there for the loot. He wanted to hurt somebody.
Slaughters the preacher, displays his body on the altar
for his congregation to see.
The Bible says never to take revenge,
to leave it to the Lord.
But I wasn't prepared to wait that long.
So, when your moral compass gets around to pointing at me,
yeah, you'll be pointing at one of the good guys.
And how does one of the good guys get connected with a piece of shit like Dukhovich?
I didn't know everything the dude was into.
That's an easy excuse.
You know everything about every client you ever had?
Nope. I don't decide whether my clients live or die.
He changed the codes on me. Son of a bitch.
Come on...
When's the last time you paid rent on this safe house?
I haven't done a lot of Amsterdam jobs lately.
I just need to get my gear. The problem is that...
All the windows are polycarb. They have... extra layers of laminate,
They have... extra layers of laminate,
and obviously there's a Hetzger alarm system, which is the premiere unit on the market.
It's got three fail-safes.
But if I can just...
What the...
-Jesus Christ! -Nope. Darius Kincaid.
But there are no words. I am amazing.
That's so cute!
You look so happy here.
So, is Agent Roussel the only photograph-worthy girl in your life?
Been busy working.
You must give me your designer's number.
We got four hours to court, let's get cleaned up. I need to change my bandage and take a shower.
The hot water still work in this bitch? Upstairs.
-Elevator? -No!
Fuck!
Counsel, approach the bench.
How can you allow Kincaid's testimony? A hired killer given a sweetheart deal.
A man like that will say anything to save himself.
Kincaid has no sweetheart deal. His wife will go free, not him.
The testimony will be allowed, assuming you produce your witness by 5 p.m.
You should've been here by now.
Yeah. A couple of bumps. We're on our way.
The judge isn't giving us any wiggle room.
You have less than four hours now! Well, we're gonna be there in half that.
Then why are you calling me?
Right. Well...
I'm calling you 'cause I've been thinking, and...
I forgive you.
Yeah.
It feels good to say that.
I forgive you, Amelia.
Are you fucking kidding me?
What?
-You're seriously doing this now? No.
-And forgive me for what? -What?
-There's nothing to forgive! -No, look, I thought that you...
Just get Kincaid here!
Fucking prick!
Darius?
Fuck!
Yeah. We've got the whole area covered.
If Kincaid shows up, he's ours.
-Stay alert. -Copy that.
Everyone keep a close lookout. He's here somewhere.
Understood.
Can I help you? Yeah, tulips.
That will be 25.
Easy.
Ay, mi cucaracha.
Couldn't you had the flowers delivered?
Needed a personal touch. You were about to get his personal touch, -if I hadn't followed you. -All right, I appreciate you.
-if I hadn't followed you. -All right, I appreciate you.
And the guys who started tracking you a few blocks ago.
You mean the guy you snatched in the bush, and the two you left knocked out in the park?
Like I said, I appreciate you.
Okay, so if you knew that they were out there,
but you still felt it was important to deliver these flowers?
Sonia's gonna really love those flowers.
I sure fucking hope so.
Now, this is as close as I'm gonna be to her for a very long time.
It had to be special.
First.
I'm first. Look...
You were saying?
Tell me something.
The day you and Agent Roussel took that picture I saw in your place,
what kind of things would you've done for her to make her happy?
Anything. I loved her. Trusted her.
She sold me out. Case closed. Well, that's cold.
Maybe, just maybe,
you ought to give her a pass on this.
I mean, I gotta tell you, honestly,
there's not a lot of women who'd put up with your shit.
That's inspirational. Thank you.
What I meant to say: There's no women who'd put up with it.
That's better. You're an annoying motherfucker with all your rules and shit.
If she can put up with that, she must be a pretty special girl.
She is.
I told her today that I forgave her.
Really? And how'd that go?
Hard to tell.
Women don't like to be forgiven for shit
'cause that implies they did some shit to begin with.
I should just forget about Kurosawa.
-What? -Takashi Kurosawa.
He was my client, she exposed him, and he got killed.
Something funny?
She didn't expose your client!
I popped Kurosawa!
I was at the airport for another target. I spotted him by accident.
Lucky for me. Him, not so much.
Doubled my money on that corrupt Asian motherfucker.
The single most awesome shot I've made in my entire hitman career.
Three hundred meters through a firm, C-cup tittie-sized window.
Pow!
Hey, I thought you knew I was the one who popped him.
I...
-Shit! What the fuck, Bryce! Motherfu... -We're done!
That shit was two years ago, man.
You gonna be a little bitch about it?
-You're on your own! -Well, good! I'll be safer on my own!
You won't last one hour without me! You'll be dead in a minute!
Yeah, you're about as useful as a condom in a convent.
-Eat my ass! -That's what she said!
-Suck it! -Fuck you!
Suck it!
Fucking pussy.
Fuck!
Do you have any idea how prepared I was?
No, not really.
No. Every possible scenario I had covered, every kill shot,
every... every angle.
And he fucking ruins my life with one lucky shot
through a window the size of a...
Just a...
That's him.
There he goes again.
Shots fired!
I hope they kill him. I really do.
Okay.
Even if I did save him, again, you know what he'd say?
He'd say, "I had it all figured out before you got here."
He'd say, "I guess my thing just better than your thing, motherfucker."
"Guess bullets are just allergic to me, motherfucker."
This guy single-handedly ruined the word "motherfucker."
You know how hard that is to do?
I was Triple A rated Executive Protection.
I was up here.
I was up here.
And goddamn it!
Pass me the magazine.
There he is!
Hi.
Get rid of the Interpol car!
Requesting all units, heading south!
Shoot him!
Under the bridge! On your right!
Sorry.
Move! Move!
Goddamn it!
Who are these guys?
Hurry! Go!
Turn!
Shoot him!
He's getting away!
Hit the brakes!
Watch out!
To the right!
-Drop your weapon! -This way!
Fuck!
Interpol!
Fuck!
Shit!
Hurry!
Fuck!
Fuck!
It's two hours until the deadline. How are we doing?
Goran has the bodyguard. I'm going to interrogate him now.
No, I need you here in case Kincaid shows up.
Goran will make him talk.
Okay.
What kind of asshole wears a helmet this tight?
A loose helmet is like wearing no helmet at all.
It's not a button strap. It's a D-ring.
Just unthread it through the thing. It's very simple.
Well... Or there's... There's that shortcut.
Ew!
I ask you one time, polite.
Where is Kincaid?
Honestly, I'd tell you if I knew.
You have my word. Look at my right hand.
See that? That's a boy scout salute.
We're sworn to never lie. I've taken an oath, so you can trust...
Right in the fucking ear!
Really? Waterboarding? Really?
I was in the CIA. You know, we don't do that anymore.
Okay. Hey. Hold it. Wait.
Here's what we learned.
The key to interrogation is establishing a bond
between the interrogator and the subject, okay?
You know, just sort of like a rapport, okay?
You need me to like you. You need me to like you, okay?
You need me to like you!
I really don't like you.
Okay...
Where is Kincaid?
He's right behind you. Scout's honor.
Fuck!
Hey, listen, before you start talking,
'cause I know you're gonna start fucking talking,
I just want to apologize for laughing about popping Kurosawa.
I know that shit cost you your girl and that...
fake-ass, made-up Triple A shit you keep talking about.
No, no, no... No, it was all my fault.
No...
I did it all to myself.
Bryce, please! You didn't do it to yourself.
That's life. Life happens. Life without Amelia.
Hey. Still time to work that shit out.
So, how'd you and Agent Roussel meet?
On a job.
She was...
She was working an undercover op,
very badly.
I was at a client's funeral. Massive heart attack.
I can protect someone from bullets and explosives,
but there's nothing I can do
against indiscriminate use of mayonnaise for 68 straight years.
Technically, I was still on the payroll, so I was in the building, paying my respects.
Amelia was there with some of her other Interpol Agents.
They were hoping to bust my client's shady and mayonnaise-chugging brother.
Instead of doing things nice and quiet, they got marked, and their target runs.
Oh, yeah. Leave it to Interpol to turn a really fun funeral
with lots of delicious hors d'oeuvres into a depressing carnival show
of total unprofessionalism.
Just kind of bumped into her.
See, that's what I'm talking about.
It just happened!
You didn't plan it, deduce it,
or Google running into the girl of your dreams.
You just bumped into her, the same way I just bumped into Kurosawa.
You know, when life gives you shit, you make Kool-Aid.
That's not really how that expression works.
Yeah, and that's the beauty of that motherfucker: Life.
Yeah, well, life, I mean...
Life doesn't usually give you shit, and then turn into a beverage.
That's not... At least where I'm from, that's not how it works.
Look, motherfucker, you don't have to explain
-every goddamn thing that goes on in life! -If it gives you lemons...
Okay? You don't need a reason for that shit.
-...you would make lemonade. -Just shut the fuck up!
It just doesn't work that way.
Breaking news from the Hague
suggests that if a credible witness cannot be produced within the next hour,
the former President of Belarus, Vladislav Dukhovich,
will walk free and resume power.
This would be a spectacular embarrassment for the international community
and a crushing blow for the many relatives...
Oh, they're out there.
Waiting for us to make the first move.
I know I would be.
I should've told Amelia. Told her what?
That I'm a stupid man.
Hey!
What if I told you I couldn't protect you?
I'd say you're right.
We'll just go to Amsterdam, I'll help you get Sonia out,
and you give her those flowers in person. No fucking way.
I gotta help you get back that Triple A shit I fucked up.
Guilt's killing me.
Dukhovich, that motherfucker's gotta go.
Well, it's not gonna happen unless we get there.
Shit, I'd bet on them. Normally I would, too.
I got a hot tip. There's a couple of ringers in the game.
We got our choice of wheels.
That's a good-looking Jag.
Yeah. I guarantee you if that smells like ass, it's supermodel ass.
-Really? -Oh yeah.
She blends right in.
-Fuck! -That's responsive!
Jesus. No! I have... I have a pen knife.
It's just that the gearshift's on the right-hand side here, and I'm not used to that.
-It's practically impossible... -Get out of the fucking car.
A three-day adjustment period to figure this out.
Motherfucker, I will bust a cap in your ass,
if you don't give up that wheel.
-Have you ever said please or-- -Please, motherfucker!
Why are we always yelling?
-Get out of the fucking car! -Fine!
Time's just about up.
No sign. They vanished in Amsterdam.
Dukhovich is free. Michael would never let that happen.
It appears you're wrong about your Michael Bryce.
Hello?
-Hey. -Michael, where are you?
We're a couple minutes out.
Look...
I wanna tell you that I'm sorry.
I wanna say that I'm sorry for... for everything.
For Kurosawa, us, it's all my fault.
You know, I act like a...
I act like a fucking child around you.
I can't admit that it's my fault, and I project that onto you,
and, you know, that's not fair.
You deserve better than that.
That's them!
Why are you telling me this now?
Well, under the circumstances, it seemed like a good time.
We got company.
We have them. Blue Ford C-Max on Route 44.
Let's go!
Amelia.
Amelia.
Just want to say that...
I... love you.
Jesus Christ! Really?
What happened to the seat belt rule?
Fuck!
-Look... -Move your fucking car!
Hurry! Over here!
Michael? Michael?
-Who this? -Hello?
Agent Roussel, hold on, let me put you on speaker.
What happened to Michael?
He had to bounce.
Excuse me. Sorry.
He really cares about you.
He has a hard time processing emotions and shit.
But one thing his fucked-up brain has figured out, is he really loves you.
You in the middle of something?
Well, actually, yeah, I am. Look, we'll call you back.
-Follow me, hurry! -Pass me the magazine.
Watch out!
Move!
Okay, gentlemen...
Fuck!
If you wouldn't mind...
The gun.
Yes.
Thank you.
Yo! You about done? Tick-tock, motherfucker!
He's fucking unkillable.
With just five minutes remaining before the court's deadline,
the case against Vladislav Dukhovich is almost certainly doomed.
Suspicious vehicle's approaching.
Stop the car!
What's going on here?
Is this what we've been waiting for?
Shit.
I got your witness, Darius Kincaid.
Follow me.
Obviously, Your Honor,
this has devolved into a complete waste of my client's time.
The prosecution has no witness to present.
Can you empty your pockets, please, sir?
Are you kidding me? Come on!
As we seem to be reaching our deadline,
I have no choice but to declare that this trial has come to its natural...
Your Honor, I present Darius Kincaid.
The deadline has passed!
I believe we still had a few seconds on the clock.
How do I look? You got a little speck of blood on your...
Everywhere.
Will the prosecution please prepare their witness?
-Hi. -My God, are you okay?
Yeah.
There's your guy.
-Thank you. -Yeah.
By the way, bumping into you is the best thing that ever happened to me.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
Yeah.
Your name is Darius Kincaid? No.
My real name is Darius Evans.
My parents separated when I was six. My mother remarried a real mean piece of work
named Roger Kincaid.
She figured if I took his name,
he'd keep his belt on more often.
Plan didn't work so well, but the name stuck.
My real father's name is Maurice Evans, preacher.
He was killed a few years later in his own church.
I'm sorry, I didn't... That's all right. Can't research everything.
Mr. Kincaid, were you ever in the employ of Vladislav Dukhovich?
-No. -Have you ever met Dukhovich?
Yes. April 17, 2012, he invited me to his palace.
Prosecution exhibit 17-D, palace security logs.
Did he offer you employment then?
Yes, he did.
He wanted me to take out a political rival exiled in the UK.
-I refused. -Why?
Because while I was there, he ordered his men
to slaughter a village outside Polotsk.
I'm not down with killing innocent people.
And do you have evidence to corroborate this? Yeah.
Go to FTP site Raven 257.
Just load it up.
Exhibit 18-D.
We've confirmed the coordinates.
-It's asking for a password. -Oh. Sorry. Password...
"Dukhovich is a dick," all caps, except "dick" is lower case.
I wasn't gonna trust Interpol with this shit.
Order!
Order!
Order in the court!
Your Honors,
I could save us all some time.
May I address the court?
Initiate alternate measures.
For months, I have been sitting in this chair,
nodding along to this ludicrous charade.
Excuse me.
My excellent attorney was hoping for the legitimacy of a formal acquittal,
but that is no longer possible.
Thank you, Darius.
So, let us now end the charade.
The charges against me
are entirely correct.
-I am the rightful ruler of Belarus! -Mr. Dukhovich.
-I am the rightful ruler of Belarus! -Mr. Dukhovich. Sit down!
As the ruler of my nation,
I'll do as I wish without exception, without apology.
-Sit down! Order! -I recognize no authority...
-...that limits my power! -Mr. Dukhovich, I order you...
-Assistant director. -Go do your job, Amelia!
In this trial...
The world community is attempting to make a statement!
Well, now I would like to make a statement of my own!
Show me your phone.
I recognize no authority that limits my powers!
Everybody go!
I will now take my leave with my dignity intact!
Now, that's what I call Triple A service.
Fuck!
Fuck! Medic! I need a medic over here!
-Lockdown protocol! -Don't move!
We're here live in front of the ICC in the Hague
where a truck bomb has just plowed into a crowd of protesters.
Emergency! It's a critical health situation!
We need immediate air and ground support!
Focus on me, Bryce. Bryce! Focus on me.
I'd really rather not.
All units.
Stay with me, Bryce. Stay with me.
I did my job. You go do yours.
Go! Gotta go get that motherfucker!
Freeze! On your knees.
Airplane to tower, airmed one requests priority clearance
to restricted zone bravo for casualty extraction.
Officer, the building is in lockdown.
Dukhovich does not leave his cell.
Let's go!
It's over, Assistant Director. Give up.
I didn't want to do this, Amelia. I swear to you.
Oh fuck!
Michael!
Michael!
-Michael, you hear me? -Are you okay? Yeah?
-Yeah. -Good...
-You? -Yeah.
Oh, no. You're bleeding.
Oh, no, no... I'm fine.
I'll get some help.
Stay here.
Take her down!
Up on the ledge, Dookie man.
You heard me, bitch! Up on the ledge!
The look on your face.
You're so proud.
Darius Kincaid,
about to be a hero, save the day.
None of that matters.
There is no redemption,
no atonement for a man like you.
Your whole life has been but a trail of corpses,
and I will be just another dead body on the pile!
Go ahead!
Finish me!
But don't think for a moment it will change what you are.
I don't give a fuck about all of that!
You fucked up
when you shot my bodyguard.
Who?
Dukhovich.
That's Dukhovich.
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.
Celebrity security.
It's low stress.
Boy bands and shit, right? One of those guys gets killed, nobody's getting all that mad at me.
-Well, we'll figure it out. -We will?
Yo! What a brother gotta do to get arrested up in this bitch?
Can't someone just taser him? I mean, like, a non-lethal taser.
Director Casoria.
My deal still good?
You definitely held up your end, Mr. Kincaid.
Agent Roussel, why don't you go find Mr. Kincaid some handcuffs.
With pleasure.
You were right to trust your instincts. Well done.
Thank you, ma'am.
-You're welcome. -For what?
I got you a front row seat to the Roussel show,
and I got you that all-access backstage pass
-to that ass you've been wanting so bad. -You did what?
You jumped out of the car, I gave her the 411 on you.
I didn't jump out... I went through the windshield.
-Semantics. -Semantics?
Semantics. Just another way of saying the same thing...
I know what semantics means. I also know I don't need love advice from you.
Really? So tell me how that love life shit was going before I showed up.
You know, she's gonna be right back, and that's it.
Last chance to run.
I'm going along with the program till Sonia's free. Then I do my thing.
You really think it's gonna be that easy, do you?
Motherfucker, please.
You know when I want some shit to pop, it pops.
Like that shot through that tittie-small window
-on Kurosawa's plane. -That's enough. -Okay, that's enough. -Show me the face you made
-Okay, that's enough. -Show me the face you made -when that shit went down. -That still stings.
I know you wasn't expecting that shit to happen.
Yeah, I was expecting you to blow my client's head off.
Did you have that Home Alone face thingy, like...
Do you guys have handcuffs? Do you have any?
A worldwide red notice was issued today for contract killer Darius Kincaid.
Kincaid has escaped from Her Majesty's prison, Belmarsh.
The notorious hitman is almost certainly armed
and considered extremely dangerous.
Oh, baby...
It's so romantic that you broke out of prison for our anniversary.
No way was I gonna miss it this year, corazón.
Ay, mi cucaracha.
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary, motherfucker.
Okay, let's go. Turn over!
Be quiet on set, please.
Quiet. Pipe down.
Okay. Stand by, Ryan.
Holding on the church bells.
Hold the roll, please.
Sorry, Ryan. Just waiting on church bells, mate.
Where are they coming from? Where are they coming from?
Still rolling.
All right, send Max, send Max down, would you?
Max, go find out what the fuck is going on down there.
I promised you a president
who feels your pain and who shares your dreams.
I wanna talk to you about a fundamental threat to American democracy.
to American democracy.
For the first time in the history of our country, a majority of our people believe
that the next five years will be worse than the past five years.
Shit.
[on PA] Howdy, folks.
Apologize for the delay.
We're number 11 for takeoff.
We'll try to make it up in the air.
Just wake me up over Texas.
[Barry on PA] Apologies from the flight deck.
Just a little bit of turbulence.
[Barry] Thank you all for flying TWA tonight.
Welcome to Baton Rouge.
[announcer on radio] The people's choice...
...and for you history buffs, is in Louisiana...
[Barry] Hey, Luce.
Um, back here.
[Barry] Thank you for flying TWA.
Welcome to Vancouver.
Welcome to Bakersfield.
-Welcome to Denver. -[baby crying]
[Jimmy] I hope they put us up at the Holiday Inn tonight.
Those little cocktail gals are on fire.
Soon as they see a man in uniform, panties come off.
How about that landing in Detroit?
Oh, man. It was gusty that day.
[woman] One in Kentucky.
Thanks, Bobby.
Hey. Chivas on the rocks.
Barry.
What was that?
Barry Seal.
That's right.
You have a drop-off and pick-up service here every other Thursday.
Cuban exiles.
They pay commercial pilots to smuggle homegrown contraband
through Canadian hubs. Vancouver, Montreal.
Right?
I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.
-No? -No.
You're smuggling cigars.
You have an interesting file, Barry.
"File"?
Starts off with a bang.
Top of your class in the Civil Air Patrol.
Youngest pilot in TWA history.
You were going places.
What is going on here?
Revolution's in the air, Barry.
Central America, right now.
We're building nations down there, Barry.
We're building nations.
It's America at its fucking finest.
And we could use someone like you.
Goddamn.
You're CIA.
Holy shit.
[Barry] Hot damn! [chuckling] Look at her.
[Monty] Well, they, uh, they tell me she's pretty fast.
[Barry] Yeah. Yeah.
It's the fastest twin-engine on the planet. [Monty] Mmm.
[Barry] I mean, shit!
She looks like she's going 300 miles an hour just sitting there.
CIA owns this?
No. No.
Uh, "Independent Aviation Consultants."
"IAC."
Yeah.
Well, wait, is that... What do they call it,
one of them "front" groups? Is that...
-No, no, no. It's as real as IBM. -Uh-huh.
You'd run the company, but after-hours, you work for us.
Yeah.
-Takes pictures? -Mmm.
We say it "collects intelligence."
-Uh-huh. -[both laughing]
Where? Russia?
South of the border, north of the equator.
Let's just say, uh, "enemies of democracy."
Look, the real work is covert. You understand? -[Barry laughing] -[Monty chuckles] So...
[laughs] "Covert."
[Monty] So, uh, anyone finds out about it,
uh, family, friends, even Lucy. It's Lucy, right?
Yeah, that's right.
That'd be a problem.
What?
All this is legal?
If you're doing it for the good guys, yeah.
Just don't get caught, that... [chuckles]
You wanna take her for a spin?
Fuck it! Take her for a fucking spin! [laughs]
I want you to take her for a spin.
-It's all for me. -Mmm-hmm. It's new business. It's gonna be my business.
Okay.
-Logistical support for airports. -That's right.
Okay. And you're calling it "IAC"?
What do you know about business?
-Uh... -You are a TWA airline pilot.
That's how you support this family.
This is gonna be good for us, all right?
What about benefits? Our healthcare?
We have great healthcare with TWA. [stammers] That's...
You know, I'm sure that's not gonna be a problem.
And what the hell does "IAC" mean, anyway?
Independent Aviation Consultants.
Well, that sounds fuckin' made up, Barry.
It does?
[Barry] Flight controls free and correct.
Warning and enunciator lights.
Check on that.
-Anti-skid lights. -That's off.
-Landing gear. -Handle's down. Three green.
Speed brake lever. Stowed.
-Thrust levers. -Cut off.
-Engine start levers. -Cut off.
-Slap trim cut-off switches. -Normal.
Fire warning system?
Check.
Radius transponder radar?
Barry? Radius transponder radar?
Yeah. Check, check.
Rudder, aileron trim?
Zero, zero.
Windows?
Closed.
Flight attendant briefing?
Barry?
You're gonna be all right, Jimmy.
Where are you... Where are you going?
Barry! Barry, where are you going?
[Barry chuckles] Shit! I know, I know.
That was bold.
That was bold.
I do tend to leap before I look.
Maybe, uh... [clicks tongue]
Maybe I should have asked a few more questions.
Anyway, it was back in '78 and, uh...
It was September? October.
Anyway, it, uh...
That was the day I joined the CIA.
Now, in those days, the Cold War was in full swing.
The Soviets were backing communist insurgents all over Central America. -[screeching] -[growling]
And the CIA wanted snaps of them insurgents.
[CIA official] Now, these pictures are sensational.
Who's responsible?
They're mine.
[Gary] Hey, Monty?
Yeah.
Go fuck yourself.
Oh, shit!
Come on, now. Come on, now.
Fuck!
[announcer] The people's choice.
[Monty] So, uh... So then I show him this one.
And he goes, "God damn it, Schafer, I didn't ask for mug shots."
I mean, they say they're the best reconnaissance photos they have ever seen.
Does this mean I get a raise?
You're doing great.
Hey, you got a family, Schafer?
-[doctor] Big push! -[screams]
-Motherfucker! -[baby cries]
Wife? Kids?
I didn't tell Lucy I ain't working for TWA no more.
You're serving your country.
I am gonna need some more money at some point.
You'll figure it out.
We're sending you to Panama tomorrow.
[Barry] The CIA was so happy with my work...
they gave me another job.
Bagman.
See, there was this colonel down in Panama
named Noriega.
And he was selling the agency's intel on all the commies down there.
For your friends.
[Barry] My job was just to drop off and pick up.
Just drop off...
Pick up.
[announcer on radio] Right here in Baton Rouge.
You're listening to the best Louisiana music.
[Barry] Hey, Luce, pancakes are up.
[Lucy] Thanks, baby.
Hola.
In the car.
Hey, uh...
A dónde vamos, fellas?
Welcome.
Come on up.
Thank you for coming to see me.
Sir, I... I think there's been some sort of mistake here, because I...
These fellas just picked me up at the airport, and--
No, no. No mistake. Just, please, have a seat.
Coffee, Mr. Seal?
You know my name?
You're the gringo who flies to Central America every week...
taking pictures very low with your fancy plane.
[chuckles] Oh, yeah, I mean, uh...
Those photos... See, I have a, uh,
aviation company here in South America that I--
Yes. Yes, the AIC.
IAC. Yes, sir.
Or is it CIA?
[chuckling] What?
No... No, no, no. I'm just a businessman here.
I'm a businessman.
Imports, exports, cattle, horses.
But now...
Now, God above has blessed this great country with new riches, Mr. Seal.
And you could help us.
How's that?
You know the routes,
you can get in and out of Estados Unidos with your fancy plane.
What... What kind of riches are we talking about here?
[Ochoa] Cocaine, Mr. Seal!
We had a few difficulties getting our exports to your country, Mr. Seal.
[woman on radio] Nine-nine-nine-six.
Ma'am, what's in the bag?
We decided to try new ideas.
We want you to take off from here, fly directly to Miami.
We'll pay you $2,000 per kilo.
How much is a kilo?
2.2 pounds, Mr. Seal.
[Barry] $2,000...
every 2.2 pounds.
I... I'm sorry, fellas.
I didn't catch y'all's names.
Jorge Ochoa.
Carlos Lehder.
Pablo Escobar.
A couple of billion dollars from now,
they'd be known as the Medellín Cartel.
Back then, they were just three businessmen
trying to figure out how to get their merchandise to the United States.
There was just one small problem.
See, pilots, they were killing themselves trying to get off that runway.
I see you had a few other boys try to make it outta here.
[chuckles] Si, si.
Terrible pilots.
Yeah, well...
I'm sure they were heavy, you know,
carrying a lot of fuel to make it to the States, and merchandise, and...
Yeah, you know, this airport, I mean, it's high altitude and a short runway.
And, I mean, shit, you got trees and mountains on both sides.
Is there, uh... Is there somewhere else I could take off from?
[Ochoa] Nowhere the Army wouldn't notice.
Well, uh...
Can you make the runway longer?
[Ochoa in English] They say I should get rid of you.
That you can't do it.
[Ochoa] We have our people in Miami. [Barry] Yeah.
You're gonna land at the Okeechobee airport between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m.
[Barry] Look, there's, uh...
There's been a change of plans, 'cause I ain't landing in Miami in--
-[Escobar speaks Spanish] -Thank you. Gracias.
See, I ain't landing anywhere with this stuff.
That's... That's how y'all got in trouble.
Now, look, just... Just hear me out.
I know Louisiana. Now, here's a map.
Now, I'm gonna drop this stuff right where "X" marks the spot.
All right? Just... [grunts]
What do you mean, you're not gonna land, huevón?
[Barry] Okay. Now, just...
Hey. Come here, look...
Look... Just look at this.
Look.
See right here?
See that there?
Right there is your million-dollar door.
All right. You just go around. Each side.
But tight.
No, no, no. No more.
I said no more.
But there's plenty of room, gringo.
No, no, no. [speaking Spanish]
Guys, guys, it ain't about room, all right? It's about weight.
Now, we agreed on 200, I even put on 300.
No, no, no. [speaking Spanish]
Keep pushing. Come on. Need all the runway I can get.
Keep going. Keep going.
[in English] Hold! Hold!
Bien. Bien.
Gracias, gracias.
Where the hell do you think you're going, big fella?
Come on. Out.
He's gonna guard our product.
This guy's fatter than fuck.
I'm already 1,500 pounds overweight.
Either I fly the big fella or I fly your product.
Good luck, hermano. Christ will keep you safe.
He ain't gonna make this runway any longer.
Hey, Jorge. Come here, give me that.
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!
Oh, Jesus!
I've got a possible target headed due north 25 miles offshore.
I've got a possible target headed due north 25 miles offshore. Yeah.
That's platform 14. One of Shell's helicopters.
You can disregard.
Cheers! Cheers!
Barry. [speaks Spanish]
For you.
[in English] Was that, uh, "Wednesday"?
You want me to go... He wants me to go again on Wednesday?
Yes. Next Wednesday.
[Barry] Well, what about the, uh, that runway?
Pablo! Jorge!
[in English] Wait here, Barry. Wait here.
-[Barry] Are we running? -Uh-uh. [clicks tongue]
What...
What is that? You want me to wait here?
Pablo?
[Barry] Oh, God.
-Don't shoot! -[soldier speaks Spanish]
No, no, no.
[Monty] Barry?
Barry Seal.
Schafer?
-Barry Seal? -Schafer?
Yeah. No, no, no. Oh, my God!
You look terrible.
It is so good to see you.
-You missing a tooth? -Yeah.
-Listen-- -What the fuck?
-See these fellas right here? -Yeah.
I think they know that I am CIA.
You're not CIA.
You're a drug smuggler, Barry.
Listen, Louisiana PD was notified of your arrest here.
They're gonna raid your house at 6:00 a.m.
They're gonna pick up Lucy, bring her in for questioning.
Maybe even keep her overnight.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. You gotta get me out of here.
Well, maybe...
Maybe we could figure something out.
[Barry] Okay, you can... You can stop now if you want.
'Cause, believe me,
shit gets crazy from here.
Do you remember them fellas that I told you I was taking snaps of?
Turns out they was a bunch of commies.
Called themselves "Sandinistas."
These fellas managed to get their shit together
and take control right here in this little country called Nicaragua.
Oh, no, that's El Salvador.
Here you go. Nicaragua.
[announcer] Theirs is the first successful revolution in Central America.
[Barry] Now, that may have been bad news for some people,
but not for me.
See, there was a new sheriff in town.
My fellow Americans, I must speak to you tonight
about a mounting danger in Central America.
[Barry] Even after everything that happened, I...
I still love Ronnie Reagan.
I mean, any man that can make it from that monkey movie
all the way to the White House...
-[banging] -What's the matter with him?
[Barry] ...he's gotta know what the hell he's doing.
And what he wanted was to kick them commie Sandinistas out of Nicaragua.
And he wanted the Nicaraguan freedom fighters, called "Contras," to do it.
They need to know that the U.S. supports them
with more than just pretty words and good wishes.
[Barry] But Congress, well, they smelled the makings of another Vietnam,
and they outright refused to let Ronnie have his war.
But do you think them politicians could tell the Gipper what to do?
Hell no. He turned to the CIA,
and the CIA turned to me.
Schafer? So, Schafer, that morning raid on my family, that's off now, right?
No, no. That's, uh... That's still happening.
-What? -6:00 a.m.
This fucking country!
-Well, hold on, now. -Stop!
Now, we have a deal!
I'm not a cop, Barry.
I can't make a search warrant go away, you know?
Things are in motion here.
Come on, man. What the hell am I gonna do?
I suggest you get your family outta Louisiana.
Well, where am I supposed to take them?
We got a place for ya.
Mena.
Arkansas.
Arkansas?
[Barry] Hey.
-Mmm. -Hey, Luce.
Mmm. Hey, baby.
Hey, hey, hey.
My God, baby, what happened to you?
I'm okay.
Barry, you're missing a tooth.
-Hey, uh... -[clock ticking]
We're moving.
We gotta pack everything up.
We gotta be outta here before the sun comes up.
So, we'll get these dresses and...
You need all them shoes?
Well, hey there, sunshine.
How you doing?
Now, look. I'm gonna give you a plastic bag.
What I want you to do is you go upstairs and you put your favorite toys--
Go on back to bed, honey. Daddy done lost his mind.
No. Darlin', you listen to Daddy.
You go do that 'cause we're going on an adventure.
[Lucy] No, we're not going on an adventure.
Like the time we went camping in the parish?
Not actually, but...
'Cause every adventure is different.
Oh, my God. You're actually serious right now.
Barry, it's 4:00 a.m., I'm not moving.
Christina's school play is tomorrow.
Hey, do you trust me?
No!
But you love me. You do love me.
Yeah, of course, I fucking love you.
Then, listen, we gotta move.
And we gotta get outta here before the sun comes up.
Look at that. They got barbecue.
It's got a lot of charm.
This place has got a lot of charm.
[Sheriff Downing] Plenty. But all we got's a porta-potty out back.
And I think that'd be cruel and unusual punishment. Right?
Well, I'll be sure to give 'em a good what for on Monday, though.
All right?
[Christina] Thank you.
[Barry] Front door's open.
[shushing] It's okay.
That's... That's an easy fix.
I gotta...
Get in. Come on.
Oh, shit.
We gotta make this quick.
She might leave me before I get back.
So, this is all yours.
Including everything between here and your house.
Almost 2,000 acres.
What do you think?
I own all this?
Oh, yeah.
This whole airport?
Yeah. Congratulations.
[Monty] AK-47s.
Soviet-made for the PLO.
The Israelis captured these and then secretly traded them to us.
And you're gonna fly 'em to Nicaragua.
Uh, you didn't say nothing about guns.
It's a war, Barry.
Freedom fighters can't put up much of a fight if they aren't armed.
This was the deal.
Or would you rather be in a Colombian prison?
This is every current law enforcement investigation
This is every current law enforcement investigation on the Gulf Coast.
FBI, ATF, DEA, Customs.
These maps will help you avoid all of 'em.
Holy shit.
You'd just fly where they ain't.
Everything in this hangar's mine?
Oh, yeah.
-That truck's mine? -Mmm-hmm.
Tools are mine?
Yes, sir.
This airplane's mine.
Bag is mine.
What bag?
[Lucy] I fed the kids.
They're sleeping.
Unpacked the car.
That's good.
Fixed the sink. Just a valve.
See? I told you that was gonna be easy.
Fuck, Barry!
Okay. All right! All right. Okay.
I'm gonna come clean.
I don't work for TWA no more.
No shit, Barry.
Are you going to prison?
No, ma'am. [chuckles]
You've gotta take care of this family.
'Cause I will take the kids.
I will go right back to working for Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Luce, what I'm working on, it's--
Barry, I am six months pregnant.
It's top secret.
I need a fridge.
I need beds for our children.
I need a stove, a fucking washing machine...
Washing machine over there, all right?
Now, let me just...
Is this all legal?
All right. What I'm about to tell you, you... You...
You gotta swear you can't ever tell anybody this, Lucy.
All right?
[whispers] I am working...
for the CIA.
Howdy, amigos.
I am here on behalf of Uncle Sam.
[Barry] Look, Schafer. I ain't no military expert,
but are you sure these are the right guys?
'Cause they seemed a damn sight more interested in my boots than in your guns.
[Monty over phone] Now, look. This is getting big time.
Schafer, I just don't think I'm the guy for this.
You just keep delivering that pizza, hear me?
You just keep delivering.
All right.
These are gifts.
All right?
All right? Gifts.
[in English] Back off. Off.
Now, these guns are gifts from Uncle Sam.
I'm not fucking around.
Barry! Put the bat down, huevón.
We're all friends here.
Jorge.
What the hell are you doing here?
[Ochoa] This is Don Adolfo Calero.
He works for your government on the revolution
to bring down the Sandinistas.
Jorge tells me you are the crazy gringo who always delivers.
[Ochoa] We have a new business proposition to you, Barry.
You bring your American guns to Colombia,
deliver our cocaine here, to the Contras.
The Contras take it by fishing boats to Miami...
And everybody's happy.
It's for the war effort, Mr. Seal.
[Barry] Turns out, the Contras didn't really want to fight a war.
They just wanted to make money.
Like the rest of us.
Meanwhile, the Medellín Cartel wanted guns.
So they worked out a little trade. What was I gonna tell 'em?
I'm just a gringo who always delivers.
Here's how the operation worked.
I'd load up with guns in Mena,
then, using Schafer's intel, I'd bypass any law enforcement
and fly straight to the Cartel's airstrip in Medellín.
[Barry] The Colombians, well, they loved them guns.
And I'd load up with fresh powder... and fly on to the Contra training camp.
The Contras hid the coke in fishing boats and sailed it up to Miami.
Meanwhile, I'd get another load of powder,
take it back to the States with a quick stop to refuel in Panama
under the protection of my old friend, Colonel Noriega.
Congratulations on your promotion, General.
'Course, he'd get his cut, too.
On the way back, I'd keep an eye out for the DEA
and then I'd dump it all in the swamps of Louisiana.
The operation got so big, I had to get some help.
Pete Dubois manufactured guns
until he discovered he had a knack for selling pot.
Stan Mason flew dope from Mexico to Arizona.
Bill Cooper. He flew opium all around Southeast Asia during Vietnam.
Then there's Bob. Uh...
I don't know much about Bob. Hell of a pilot, though.
I called these boys my "Snowbirds,"
and we could fly through anything.
Schafer!
Barry.
How's it going?
[Bill] Hey, boss!
That was fucking crazy, man! Whoo! [laughs]
How's it, uh... How's it going down there?
Oh, you know...
Busy.
You?
Busy.
Where are they going?
We need to borrow some of your land.
They want you to fly 'em up here to... To train.
For training.
Who?
The Contras.
You... You want me to bring 'em up here?
To Mena?
We're setting up a field and operational training ground.
Where? On...
-On my land? -Yeah.
Starting immediately.
Which is great.
Is that a problem?
No.
Hey...
Whatever you need, boss.
Hang on! We're supposed to have 15.
I'm only counting 12 here.
Them Contras were damn excited about being in the U.S. of A.
And they were running away almost faster than we could bring 'em in.
[CIA man] Hey, you two! Where you think you're going?
Wow. You wanna quadruple the shipments?
We're confident the Contras can win by summer
if we give 'em what they need.
That's great.
[Winter] How much more can you get out of your guy in Mena?
[Monty] Oh, we'll get everything out of him.
That's what I like to hear.
We're expanding operations, Barry.
[Barry] Come on, now. One at a time!
Just one at a time! Hey, hold on! Hold on!
-[all clamoring] -No, no, no.
We'll take care of everybody.
[in English] Back! Hands off!
Please. Back! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[in English] Everyone, just calm the fuck down!
[in English] Hey, Barry.
Yeah?
You think those Contras can win?
No.
[Sheriff Downing] Hi.
This just came. "Go Razorbacks. Barry."
Season tickets.
Fifty-yard line.
Well, that was awful nice of him.
How much property has Seal bought up since he came to town?
I don't know, 500 acres?
Two thousand acres. From the airport to Ouachita.
What's he want with all that worthless land?
It's... It's really none of our business, really.
He's good people, Judy.
He's doing a lot for the community.
I'd like to open a bank account.
Oh. Bless you!
I'll be right back.
David!
-[Lucy] Come on, Christina! -[crowd applauding]
-[man] Good job, guys, good job! -Whoo!
-[Lucy] Way to go, Christina! -Go, go, go!
Oranges. You guys want some oranges?
[Lucy] Hey, guys, I got pizza!
-You guys want some pizza? -[kids] Yeah!
Here you go! All right. Let me just put this right...
There you go.
-Nice wheels! -Oh, you like her?
[chuckles] I do.
1982.
All the bells and whistles.
First one in the state of Arkansas, and she's yours.
She's mine?
She's yours.
Oh, my God, Barry!
Thank you!
-Wow. -A little something extra in there.
Fuck me, Barry!
What?
Okay. You need to behave.
[Lucy] I brought some snacks out for you, Christina.
[Barry] By the summer of '82...
business was a-boomin'.
Got us at Tuesday, three o'clock. Tuesday at three o'clock.
[Ochoa on phone] We need to increase the shipments.
Can you add a Friday delivery?
-Friday? Okay. Hold on, now. -[phone ringing] Yeah?
We wanna double the amount of guns we're bringing in. [Barry] Double?
[Monty] Next batch by Friday.
[stammers] Oh, hold on. Does... Does it have to be Friday?
[Barry] I opened a few front corporations.
I can't wait to learn everything there is to know
I can't wait to learn everything there is to know about the sign business, Mr. Seal.
Me, too.
I spent 30 years working the pumps at Gas N' Sip.
Well, sir, I think it's about time you moved to upper management.
But the money was coming in faster than I could launder it.
[Barry] I was taking pictures, delivering guns...
dropping off and picking up.
[chuckles] Damn, I was building an air force.
-New toy, boys! -[all laugh]
-I wanted to get new books. -[Lucy] You did?
What're you doing? Barry!
[Lucy] Smile, Barry.
-[Barry] Jorge! -[Ochoa speaks Spanish]
[in English] Lobsters! Oh, you remembered!
What'd I tell you? You think I'm gonna forget that?
Your husband is a genius.
Well, it absolutely, positively has to be delivered overnight.
Esposa, Lucy.
-No, no, no. -[speaking Spanish]
[Barry] I had my fingers in every pie on the rack.
Ten million in Mena National,
twelve million in Mena State,
fifteen in Mena Trust.
I had 40 parked in Miami,
twenty in Panama, seven million in lawn bags,
eight in Samsonites, four buried in the woods behind my house,
and 90 pounds of gold in my closet.
Hot damn!
Oh, honey, watch the yoke.
If this ain't the greatest country in the world. Ah!
JB.
Yeah.
-Hey, sis! -JB!
[JB] What the fuck?
Look at you!
-Look at you! -God damn!
Get in here.
Look at this fucking house!
Parking a Chevy's a lot harder than it fucking looks, Luce.
Hey! Watch your mouth around the kids.
-Sorry. -[videogame running]
That right?
[JB] Yeah, man.
They had me cramming those S-10s
into every goddamn inch of the parking lot...
[Lucy] Hey, you heard me!
I'm sorry!
Look, the thing is, is that the cars were so close to each other, right,
-you couldn't help but scratch, right? -[Barry] Yeah.
Then they would take the scratches out of my fucking paycheck, man!
-[Lucy] Hey! JB! -[JB] Sorry.
Well, I don't know how you handle the pressure, JB.
You're staying here, you're getting a job.
Or, you know, I could just give you some folding cash, you go on and do what you want.
-Don't you look at him like that. -[JB] What?
You are getting a job, JB, not a handout.
My brother's getting a job, Barry.
You're getting a job.
Definitely.
Well, you hear that? That's the law.
You're gonna have to work, son.
-Gonna have to work. -[Lucy] That's right.
[JB] Uh, what is it I'll be doing, exactly?
Yo, Barry!
Hey, Barry.
Barry! What now, JB?
So this is a big hangar, and I'm tired of sweeping.
You can take a break when you get it done.
Let's go. Get it done!
[Bill] Hey, man, I got a new job for you.
Get me a beer, man.
Dead soldier.
Here's your fucking...
[Lucy] Barry?
Yeah?
Roscoe dug this up in the backyard.
There are bills blowing around everywhere.
I'll rake it up in the morning.
I found three more of 'em up in the fireplace.
Shit.
We had cash flooding in from every direction.
Who... Who thought that was gonna be a problem? I mean...
We were running out of places to put it.
Easy. Whoa.
Don't get behind 'em. These are dangerous animals.
You know, maybe you should call the trainer. No, honey, I got this.
Come on, now.
Hang on.
[JB] What you think of that?
[girl] Holy shit!
JB got a new car.
Did you give that boy a raise?
[JB] Hey, Barry, Luce!
What in the holy fuck?
That girl is 15.
-It's huge! -I told you it was huge!
-You actually live here? -Uh-huh.
Hey! Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.
-What? -Come here.
[Lucy] What the hell, JB?
What?
I haven't done nothing yet!
-JB. Come on. -Hi, Miss Seal.
What... We were just gonna go for a swim.
Come here.
Please don't tell my mama that I was here.
[Lucy] Come on, honey. Let's go inside.
Where'd you get the money for this car?
I'm gonna be honest with you, Barry, 'cause I can't lie to you.
I stole it from the hangar.
All right.
I opened up one of the Samsonites. I found so much fucking money in there, man.
-JB, JB, JB. -So much goddamn money.
JB, you can't do that.
You can't do that.
[Pete] 500 down 300.
Watch out for that tree at the end.
[Barry] Yeah, I remember that.
No, Pete, you gotta turn that off. I can't see nothing with it on.
[Pete] Gotcha.
Seventy-five. Fifty.
[exhales sharply] Nicely done, boss.
You boys see this?
Oh! Fuck!
[man on radio] This is the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.
You are in violation of the Air Defense Identification Zone.
We are ordering you to land immediately.
Follow us to New Orleans NAS.
All right, boys. It's gonna be a long night.
Let's go back out to sea, 105 knots.
Get them flaps down.
[man on radio] I repeat, we are ordering you to land immediately.
[Barry] The DEA was using these fancy new jets that we couldn't outrun. [man on radio] Follow us to New Orleans NAS.
[man on radio] Follow us to New Orleans NAS.
[Barry] But all that speed comes at a heavy price.
[man on radio] I repeat...
[Barry] They could go fast...
but we could go slow.
For a long time.
[automated voice] Low fuel. Low fuel.
-[beeping] -We gotta turn around, guys. We're bingo.
Those pricks are right fucking there!
[Barry on radio] All right, boys.
DEA finally ran out of gas. Time to head home.
[Pete] Bill! The fuck, man?
Where you headed, buddy? Come on.
[Barry] All right, I'll get him. I'll get him.
Bill? Come on, turn around. Come on, let's go.
Bill? You hear me?
Oh, son of a bitch!
Bill's asleep.
[laughs] God damn!
[Barry] Bill, wake... Wake up, man!
[Pete] That motherfucker can sleep anywhere.
-Wake up, Bill. -[Pete laughing]
[Barry] Bill!
[Barry] Morning, Bill!
[Bill] Okay, I'm up, I'm up.
Welcome back.
Those bank financials that you asked for.
[McCall] Yeah.
There's a lot of money in Mena, Arkansas.
Thanks.
I think you're gonna appreciate what we've done here, Barry.
You're making me my own vault?
Oh, no, no. We're using this auxiliary for all our other customers.
We gave you the main vault.
How 'bout that!
[man on radio] Aerostar 2-1-niner-3-golf.
Head for New Orleans Naval Air Station at once.
Yeah. Come on, come on, come on!
You better run, you prick.
[man on radio] This is the United States Border Patrol.
[Barry] Shit.
[man on radio] We are ordering you to land.
[Barry] Hey, boys.
I see you finally got smart and got a slower plane.
Two of 'em.
[man on radio] That's right, son.
We up here as long as you want.
Aerostar, we are ordering you to land immediately.
[Barry] Ha. All right, motherfuckers. Let's land.
[man on radio] I repeat, we are ordering you to land...
What the fuck?
Stay on him.
Shit!
-Oh, shit! -[car horn blares]
Is this your yard?
All right. Well, that's for the damage.
And, uh, here's a little something extra for your sister.
Hey, little darlin'.
And your bike.
All right.
You never saw me.
[Gary] "A plane crashed in Louisiana with 200 kilos of Colombian powder."
Two hundred.
-Right. -Is that your boy?
I'm sorry, are you working for the fucking DEA now?
Interesting read.
I got it.
-[Ochoa] Hello, amigo. -Sí.
We had to get out of Colombia in the middle of the night.
[Barry] I wasn't the only one having trouble with the DEA.
[Ochoa] Escobar's gone crazy and declared war on the government.
[Barry] Thanks to Pablo Escobar's unique management style...
the cartel found themselves kicked out of Colombia.
The only place the DEA couldn't touch him?
That's right. Nicaragua.
[Ochoa] We're going to meet Señor Vaughan.
He's the Minister of Interiors.
He controls the airstrips.
It's how we get you in.
[Escobar in Spanish] Barry, just sit and keep your mouth shut.
-Here's your butter, sir. -Thank you.
You're welcome.
What's up?
How you doing?
Stop running!
-[JB] Fuck! -[tires screech]
-Hey, Luce, you hear me? -[Lucy] Yes.
-Honey? You all right? -Yeah, I can hear you.
Honey, I hate to tell you this right now, but JB has been arrested.
-That little shit. -[Barry] What happened?
[Lucy] I don't know. He got caught with a whole lot of money, the dumb fuck.
-[Barry] Honey... -What do you want me to do here, babe?
There ain't nothing to do, really. Uh...
I'm just in a meeting. And we'll go over that when I get home.
All right? I'll take care of that.
All right. Hurry, Barry.
All right? You just sit tight. I love you.
Okay.
How much? [speaks Spanish]
[in English] That's 15...
[Ochoa] Fifteen-hundred kilos, Barry.
-Fifteen-hundred? -Sí.
In one go.
In one go?
Well, we ain't never done that before. That's...
[Lehder] Sanctuary isn't cheap.
[scoffs] That's a lot.
Can you do it?
Yeah, I'm gonna... I'm gonna get home.
Right now. I'm gonna leave, and then... we'll figure it out.
I'll figure it out.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Get it fucking done!
Fucking lawyer doesn't know shit.
I got two fucking priors, man, and he doesn't understand.
No, no, no. He does understand.
-And you gotta do what he tells you to do. -[phone ringing]
[JB] No, he doesn't, man.
One more strike, man, one more strike and I could go to prison
-for life, man. -JB?
JB, just hold on.
Barry? Barry, are you there?
[boy] Daddy!
Hey, darlin'.
What's that? Hold on.
-Yeah? -[Ochoa] Barry.
We've been trying to get a hold of you, amigo.
Yeah, I know that, amigo.
Listen, could you hold on? I'll be right back.
-JB? -[JB] Yeah.
There's some people that wanna talk to me.
No, no, no. You don't talk to anyone about anything.
Now, you do what that lawyer tells you to, and you keep your fuckin' mouth shut.
I'm taking care of this.
Okay.
Listen, Jorge.
We gotta put on the brakes for a bit.
"Brakes"? No, no, no. No brakes.
We have product to move.
I understand, amigo. But I got a family situation.
Your brother-in-law? We know all about it.
We'll handle it, amigo.
No, no, no. I don't want you to handle it.
Barry, listen.
-I got it. I got this. -Barry.
Listen to me. We'll handle it. Okay?
-No, no, no. Jorge-- -So don't worry.
-Jorge... Jorge... -We'll talk business later.
[boy] I don't want to see Daddy no more.
[JB] Barry, they don't... They don't know about all them suitcases you got
or what you got in them planes.
The guns you got. They don't know anything about it.
We're good, man.
I can't fix this, you hear?
They're gonna give you ten... Ten years for not talking.
That's ten years people gotta worry you will.
But I didn't say anything, man! You can talk to the goddamn lawyer.
Where we going, man?
Jesus Christ! I'm fuckin' family.
We're family!
That's right.
We're family.
What's this?
Inside's a passport, first-class ticket to Bora Bora, and enough cash...
Enough cash to make a damn good life for yourself.
Now, you're gonna get in that car
and you're gonna drive straight to Dallas/Fort Worth airport.
And nowhere else.
You don't even stop to take a piss. You hear me?
Yeah, I hear you.
Good luck, kid.
I'll tell you what, Barry.
I'm gonna send you a goddamn address. Okay, Barry?
You're gonna start sending me cash on the fucking regular.
You understand? You hear me?
Fuckin' goddamn fuckin' dick, all high-and-mighty.
Piece of shit.
Oh, and Barry...
fuck you, man! Fuck you and my cunt sister.
Excuse me? Did you just...
Hey! Hey!
Money every week, asshole!
What the fuck?
What? Oh, shit.
Hey! Hey. Barry.
Oh, my God.
[Bill] Hey, Barry. Barry!
What do you need, Bill? What do you need? What do you need?
[Bill] Hey, man... Man...
I'm, like, freaking out, man. What is going on with JB?
Don't worry about JB.
[Bill scoffs] What if he talks, man?
He ain't gonna.
[Bill] Yeah, but what if he does?
He ain't gonna talk, Bill.
How do you know?
I am fucking positive!
[Bill] Okay, man.
Good. I'm gonna trust you on this one, man.
Good.
[man] In the calendar year, your operations have transported
10,500 Russian AKs to the Contras.
Yeah. Five thousand of which
have found themselves in the hands of the Colombian cartel.
Right. But...
Out of the 916 Contras brought into the United States to train,
only half made it back to Nicaragua.
-Half is-- -The other half are in the wild.
What's going on here?
Oh, yeah, the... We had to send the Contras home.
-[Barry] Home? -Yeah.
They weren't fighting.
That's the reality of that situation.
[sighs] You know, it didn't help that their guns were in Colombia.
Did it, Barry?
So...
What now? Mmm. We'll call ya.
Mmm. We'll call ya.
Call me?
Schafer?
Hey, Schafer!
Who the fuck's Schafer?
Okay, everybody, you know the drill. Everybody gets a burn bag.
Into it, you put anything with Barry Seal's face or name on it.
Come on, boys. We gotta move.
We gotta get all this stuff out of here.
-Pete. -[Pete] What? Everything?
Come on, boys, let's go. We gotta move this out.
Let's go! Let's go!
[Monty] Into the burn bag. Go!
Purchase orders. Aircraft invoices.
Be a team here. Let's move it out.
Holy shit, man.
Look at all these guns. We gotta move all of it.
Where we supposed to put all of this stuff?
Just get it off my property.
Anything with the word "Mena."
Fuel bills, memos, names, directives, photos.
Anything like that.
Anything which can link us with him, you put it in the burn bag.
And then what do you do with it?
-[man] Burn it. -You burn it.
[Bill] Bob, need a little help back here.
[Bob] In the back!
[Pete] Give me a hand with this shit.
[Bill] Got it.
[DEA agent 1] Seal! DEA!
Back away from the truck with your hands in the air.
[DEA agent 2] Drop the fucking box, shithead!
-Show us your hands! -Drop the fucking box!
[DEA agent 2] Nice and high!
ATF!
Drop your weapons!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! DEA! -Lower your guns!
ATF! Put your guns down!
Stand down!
-[DEA agent 1] It's cool! -Everybody's friends here. DEA, all right?
-This is our collar. -[DEA agent 1] Bullshit!
No, no, no.
[officer] State Police!
What the fuck are y'all doing in my county?
[McCall] Nobody move!
FBI!
Ah, fuck.
Well, hey, boys, how about my phone call?
[automated voice] We're sorry.
You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service.
Oh, shit.
If you feel you have reached this recording in error,
-please check the number and try... -Come on, Seal.
You know who I am, Mr. Seal?
No, ma'am.
I'm Dana Sibota, State Attorney General.
You've got DEA, ATF, FBI, all wanting their pound of flesh.
Yes, ma'am, it's... It's quite a room.
Yeah. Well, you hit the trifecta, didn't you?
I mean, guns, drugs, money laundering.
And the state of Arkansas is gonna rip the bark right off of you, boy.
We are gonna put you in a four-by-six cell for the rest of your life.
Ma'am, that's a long time.
Yeah.
[woman on speaker] Miss Sibota, I have Governor Clinton on the line.
He says it's urgent.
It's the Governor.
It's your governor.
Put him through. Clear the room. Take him with you.
Yeah?
What do you need, Bill?
[Barry] Did y'all know
that Caddies have more trunk space than any other car in the world?
I'll get each and every one of you a Caddy.
You'd do that for all of us?
Yes, sir. I would.
I'd get all y'all Caddies. Have 'em here this afternoon.
What are you trying to do, Seal? Add another 20 for bribery?
[Barry] Oh, no, no, no.
I'm just offering y'all Caddies for your troubles.
What troubles, Seal, hmm?
Well, bringing me down here, for one. You see...
I'm gonna walk out of here.
I'm gonna walk out of here.
And there ain't a damn thing any one of you can do about it.
[ATF agent] All right.
Do it.
-Wait. Wait. Wait a minute. -No, no.
-No, he's free to go, boys. -What the fuck?
[McCall] What the hell do you mean, "He's free to go"?
[DEA agent] You want to explain what's going on here?
-[Dana] He's free to go. -[DEA agent 2] Free to go?
You boys should've taken the Caddies.
I'll be seeing you, Seal.
Ma'am.
[Barry] I tell you,
it is good to see you boys, I ain't gonna lie.
But I figured you'd have to show up, see?
'Cause I just know too much.
Schafer sent you, right?
Who the fuck is Schafer?
All right, all right now.
Seriously, fellas, who are you?
Usually, I talk with you from my office in the West Wing of the White House,
but tonight, there's something special to talk about.
And I've asked someone very special to join me.
Are we going...
[President Reagan] Nancy?
Not long ago, I was asked by a group of children
what to do if they were offered drugs.
And I answered, "Just say no."
Drug criminals are ingenious.
So we must be smarter and stronger and tougher than they are.
Say yes to your life.
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol,
just say no.
You a pilot?
I've been known to fly some.
Me, too.
Air National Guard.
-'68, '69. -Oh.
[Vice President Bush] Junior?
Well...
I'll see you around, flyboy.
[Barry] All right.
The Sandinistas are burning the American flag in the streets.
Please. There is no deal if we don't get the Sandinistas.
-Then there's no deal. -Horseshit.
There's no deal unless we get Medellín.
[Barry] Now, you may be wondering why my ass wasn't in jail at this point.
This is disgusting!
[Barry] But I gotta be honest. Frankly, so was I.
-[Rangel] Ollie... -[Colonel North] Oh, please!
[Barry] This fella here is with the DEA.
And this fella here is a colonel named Ollie North.
Reagan's go-to guy.
The DEA just wants to nail the Medellín Cartel once and for all.
Now, at the same time, Colonel North wants to prove
the commies in Central America are involved in the drug trade.
Let me say that again.
This is disgusting!
[Barry] Colonel North wants to prove the commies are dealing drugs.
And why am I in the room?
'Cause I'm the gringo who always delivers.
So, you want me to keep going?
For your country.
We're gonna bring these guys down.
And you're gonna be a hero.
All right, then.
They put me right back in business.
Now, I'm working for the White House.
[Rangel] All right, you have three cameras.
Fifty picture loads each.
You have one here in a bag.
The sightline goes straight down the back to where those gentlemen are now.
You have two more cameras above each door.
Sightlines directly in front of the door.
Each camera has a cord.
You just press this button to take a picture.
And that's it.
Let's go.
I can see the cords, Barry.
Yeah.
I can see this damn cord, which means they gonna be able to see it.
We'll hide it.
I'm not a photographer.
-Your thumb work? -Yeah.
Well, you just push the button.
When am I supposed to push the button?
When the guys are standing here holding the powder.
You know what? Fuck it, Pete. I'll take the pictures.
[Pete] Fuck!
[Barry] Listen. What's gonna happen with these photos?
Who exactly is going to be looking at 'em?
These photos are gonna be on a need-to-know basis.
"Need-to-know."
They're gonna be classified at the highest levels, Barry.
[boy] Daddy! Daddy!
-[Barry] Classified. -Daddy!
We do recognize the dangers involved here.
No, you don't.
Well, you could always tell us to fuck off
and spend the next 30 years in Leavenworth.
[Pete] Come on, boss!
Let's get this over with!
We'll see ya, Rangel.
-[Lucy] Smile, Barry! -[son] Bye, Daddy!
Shit! There's a fucking army out there.
They're gonna torture us...
Pull our tongues out through our necks.
That ain't helping, Pete.
They're gonna cut us up in little pieces and feed us to the pigs.
I don't wanna be fed to no pigs, Barry.
Gotta keep our shit together. Hola!
We're gonna get the yayo,
take these damn pictures, then get the hell out of here.
Let's keep our shit together.
No, no, no.
They're going to hear that goddamn camera, Barry.
Escobar. Ochoa.
[Barry] Hey, hola.
[Barry] Hey, Jorge!
Jorge. Fuck!
Come on, man.
A little help?
Shoot the gringos.
-What? -Shoot the gringos!
-What's that? -Shoot the gringos! Shoot the gringos!
-[men shouting] -No, no, no!
You fucker.
Pete, stand the fuck up.
[Ochoa in English] They are shaking. You're shaking.
Look at this! Hey!
He pissed himself, man.
You got me. That was a good one.
That was a good one.
I saved your life, Barry.
-I saved your life, eh? -Yes, you did.
-Remember that. -Yeah.
Remember. Crazy gringo.
Come here, Barry.
[Barry] Hey, Jorge.
Now, let's go say hi to Pablo.
Pablo's here?
Sí. He's paranoid, amigo. On edge.
-Thinks everyone is out to get him. -Hola! Pablo!
[Barry in Spanish] Let's do this.
What?
Everything good?
I'm here.
I'm here.
And I brought your Harleys.
[in English] We're still friends?
[in English] That was a good one that you pulled right there.
You really got me.
Hey, you know, I'm gonna have to get you back.
[Barry] Jorge...
look at this, my friend.
[Pete] Say cheese, motherfuckers.
[Barry] We're gonna make history.
-[Rangel] Barry Seal! -[man] Yeah!
Barry Seal! He's a goddamn genius.
There seems to be no crime to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.
[on TV] This is an outlaw regime.
The Sandinistas have even involved themselves in the international drug trade.
I know every American parent concerned about the drug problem will be outraged
to learn that top Nicaraguan government officials
are deeply involved in drug trafficking.
This picture, secretly taken at a military airfield outside Managua
shows Federico Vaughan,
a top aide to one of the nine comandantes who rule Nicaragua...
Fuck!
...loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics bound for the United States.
[Lucy] Those motherfuckers!
That's your fucking face, Barry!
This is an outlaw regime.
[Lucy] Oh, my God!
[Ochoa in Spanish] He betrayed us!
Pablo, we have to take care of this immediately.
That son of a bitch. I'm going to rip his head off!
[Rangel on phone] I am truly sorry, Barry.
North jumped the gun.
Yeah, well, you boys fucked me good.
We all got fucked.
Those photos weren't supposed to be released,
and certainly not until we had the Colombians in custody.
Yeah, well, they ain't gonna be coming for you.
Barry, you knew the risks when you took those pictures.
You knew what you were doing.
Barry?
Barry, you there?
Let's go get some ice cream.
[Barry] The Feds, they're gonna try to take everything.
When they come...
you gotta put on all your jewelry.
All right? All your rings, you know, your bracelets.
Necklace.
'Cause if you're wearing it, they can't take it away from you.
You understand?
All right, that's insurance for you and the kids.
All right?
I understand.
All right. And don't forget that it's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right. I love you.
[Lucy] I love you.
[Barry] Sure enough, they came.
And they took it all.
Hey, Luce, honey...
I was thinking...
that you might like to move back to Baton Rouge.
[Lucy] You ain't gonna find nothing in those drawers.
Try the hat boxes, third shelf up.
I mean, you loved it there.
What about you?
I mean, I'm...
Me, uh...
Listen, you see...
Look, if I run, they're, uh...
they're gonna come for you and the kids, I mean...
That's how a thing like this goes, but, Baton Rouge, you're safe.
No.
[scoffs] No, I ain't going nowhere.
We're a family and we're staying together.
I know. But-- No, sir. I ain't doing this.
-Listen, Luce. Luce. -No.
No, no. Honey, hang on. Don't do this now.
-No, sir, sir! I'm sorry. -[Lucy] You know what?
No, no, no, sir. Come on, sir.
Excuse me, she's wearing this now. Luce, you gotta stop. Hey, you know, fellas...
Luce, you gotta stop. Hey, you know, fellas...
Sorry, hey...
Can I just have a moment... Can I just have a moment with my wife?
It's been a hell of a day. [chuckles]
-[FBI agent] Okay, Barry. -Yeah.
You got one minute.
All right. Luce?
-Honey, now listen to me. -[man] Let's give him a minute.
Baby, baby, listen to me.
-[man] All right, folks. Head on out. -Listen to me.
I'm gonna go to prison.
I'm gonna do just... Just a little time.
And I'm gonna be fine there.
And we're gonna work everything out,
but I gotta know you're gonna be safe.
It's gonna be all right.
You gotta trust me.
I mean, you trust me, right?
Fuck no!
All right.
[Barry] Luce and the kids finally did move to Baton Rouge.
[Dana] How can we have a war on drugs when the biggest enemy of the state
[Dana] How can we have a war on drugs when the biggest enemy of the state is being protected by our side?
[Barry] And that lady prosecutor...
[Dana] Why, he never informed the FBI...
[Barry] ...she never, ever did give up.
...that any such sting operation was underway.
[bailiff] Defendant will rise.
-[Judge] Barry Seal. -Your Honor.
You are sentenced to 1,000 hours community service.
-[gavel bangs] -Dismissed.
-[Dana] Oh, that is bullshit. -[Judge] Watch yourself, Sibota.
I'm sorry.
[Dana] We are talking about a drug smuggler
-here of the highest order. -Uh, community service?
Exhibit D!
[lawyer] Mr. Seal's planes are classified.
-[Dana] I am sick to fuck... -Sibota!
...of this Mickey Mouse tap-dancin' bullshit.
-[Judge] I will hold you in contempt. -[Dana] Sorry. I'm very sorry.
So, I'm walking out of here? Now?
[Judge] State of Arkansas has spoken, Mr. Seal.
Do I have to go?
[Judge] Goodbye.
Hey, darlin'.
I do tend to leap before I look.
Maybe, uh... [clicks tongue]
Maybe I should have asked a few more questions.
Excuse me, uh, sir? Ma'am?
Would y'all mind moving out of the way? I'm just gonna start my car.
-Yeah. -[man] What?
I really appreciate that now.
[woman] Honey, just keep walking. Keep walking.
Thank you. Just startin' my car.
Appreciate it.
[Barry] I spent every day in a different motel.
Would y'all mind movin' outta the way there?
Thank you.
A different motel every day.
It's just for the safety of the children. Thank you.
But I had to show up to this Salvation Army halfway house
every evening at the same time.
Judge's orders.
You here for community service?
[Barry] Same time, same place.
-Uh, what's your name, sorry? -Louis.
Louis. Barry Seal. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Sign in for me.
[Barry] 120 days in a row.
There you go.
Hey, you may wanna move your truck, too.
Now, them Contras were damn excited about being in the U.S. of A.
[guard] Hey, Barry.
When are you gonna take me flying, man?
Thanks, Barry.
[Barry] Don't tell 'em I gave you that.
Day 36.
[Barry] You know, I guess you could say I helped build an army,
defend a country,
and create the biggest drug cartel this world's ever seen.
DEA, CIA, White House.
I mean, it's been a hell of an adventure.
Yeah, sometimes a little more than I bargained for. [chuckles]
But God damn! Now, you try telling me that this ain't the greatest country in the... -[gunshot] -[glass shatters]
We'll handle it from here, Deputy.
[announcer] Authorities believe last night's machine-gun killing of Barry Seal
was ordered by drug bosses in Medellín, Colombia.
Iran.
We get the Iranians to arm the Contras.
'Schafer' got a promotion.
After his release, Pete found God and became a preacher in rural Alabama.
The other pilots were never seen again.
The CIA continued to use Barry's plane to arm the Contras...
Shit! Come on, you big, fat bitch! Pull up!
...until one was shot down over Nicaragua.
The ensuing scandal was known as the Iran-Contra Affair.
[reporter] Mr. President, what do you know about money going to the Contras?
All I know is this is just gonna taste wonderful
and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
[reporter] Vice President Bush, did you know about the Contra aid or not, sir?
But I grew older,
and that's when the questions started.
And with the questions came the suffering.
Who am I?
Where do I come from?
What is my story?
Who were those women
whose names were always pronounced quietly...
when they thought I wasn't listening?
Who were they?
Who were they?
INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY
CHUBUT PROVINCE, ARGENTINA. 1925
Can I touch your face?
I imagine there are things you'd like to know.
Things?
Everything.
It's impossible to know everything.
Are you in the first year?
But I've been sick and I missed the first few days.
If you don't dry off, you'll get sick again. Come on.
Come on!
VANITY IS YOUR WEAKNESS
Do you think they will take into account the days off that I've missed?
Don't worry, I'll talk to them.
I'm in my third year and I work here. My aunt is the headmistress.
Let me help you.
Thank you.
-Am I hurting you? -No.
And now?
No.
Now? No.
My name is Elisa.
I'm Marcela.
I like your mole.
This week, we are going to learn about pronouns.
Come in.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
Excuse me, Sister, she's new at the school and was lost.
She's been sick and missed the first few days.
But she's very hardworking and keen to get up to date quickly.
-Can she take a seat? -Yes. Thank you, Elisa.
Please...
Your name?
Marcela Gracia Ibeas.
Very well. Have a seat there, please.
Let's continue with the lesson.
People or things are not only called by their name,
but also by words which replace the name.
So, when we say,
"Bernardo was very happy with his Elvira,
and they lived happily together,
she with him, and he with her,"
"he" replaces Bernardo and "she" replaces Elvira.
You scared me. Really? I'm sorry.
I was waiting for you.
I live upstairs with my aunt and the other nuns. Didn't I tell you?
-Inside the school? -Mm-hmm.
I wanted to thank you.
There's no need.
What is it like living with the nuns?
What do you think?
I don't know.
It's hell.
Considering they're the wives of God, they're a bunch of old hags.
They're always fighting and criticizing each other,
and they're not happy.
It's like living in a harem,
where all the women fight in order to be the Sultan's favorite.
But the Sultan is never there.
Never?
I've never seen him.
Don't you believe...
in God?
I don't believe in nuns.
I don't believe in priests.
Nor the Virgin Mary, nor the Holy Spirit, especially not that.
And... I don't believe in God.
And you?
I don't know.
I only believe in things that move.
I believe in horses.
I'd do anything to have one.
What about mice? And cats and dogs, do you believe in them?
In pigeons and in snails.
And in ants, in everything.
You should go home.
And you have to go back to the nuns.
Yes.
See you tomorrow, then.
See you tomorrow.
Have a nice evening.
-Don't forget an umbrella tomorrow. -No.
Who was the girl...
that accompanied you?
She's from school.
Elisa.
She helped me find the classroom.
Her aunt is the headmistress.
There are husks in the soup.
I strained it three times.
You strained it?
In this school, you must learn, yes, but not too much.
Not too much, just enough.
Hello, Elisa.
Hello, Elisa.
Good morning, Elisa.
Good morning, Elisa.
How are you, Elisa?
Hello, Elisa. How are you?
Elisa...
Elisa...
Elisa, Elisa, Elisa...
Elisa, Elisa...
You didn't listen to me.
No.
I forgot.
This Christian victory beside the Cave of Covadonga
is the result of bravery and the Christian faith,
which nourished the Christian soldiers,
who were capable of defeating the Moorish troops,
who, I'd say, were barbarians.
Isabel and Fernando
Were excellent monarchs
-They kicked out of Spain... -Do you want to see my bedroom?
The dark-skinned Moors
Now?
If not now, when?
Elisa...
Who are you with?
Marcela, she's new at the school, Sister Clara.
Ah, and what is she like?
She's...
a redhead.
Or carrot-colored, rather.
She has lots of freckles.
And she's very fat!
-Are you sure? -And lame!
If I didn't know you, Elisa...
If I didn't know you!
This is where I read and draw.
At least they leave me alone.
Do you want me to go?
No, not you, please.
I meant the nuns and my aunt.
Do you know what they're always telling me?
No.
That I should find a man and get married soon.
If I don't, I'll have to stay with them here forever.
They tell me that day in, day out.
My dad tells me not to waste too much time at school.
And that teachers have a bad reputation.
And that I should get married now before I get pregnant.
And what do you tell him?
And you, what do you tell them?
I asked first.
I tell them...
I tell them what they want to hear.
Me too.
But instead of marrying a man, I'd rather do anything else, anything.
I don't know if I want to get married or not.
Dear me!
There are lots of things you don't know, right?
If you believe in God, if you want to get married.
Is there anything you are sure about?
I know that I was in an orphanage until I was ten.
Sleeping with 40 other girls in potato sacks.
With rats crawling where they please.
Eating watered-down soup full of dead spiders.
Seeing nothing but misery...
and filth.
And masses.
One morning, all of a sudden,
a woman came who said she was my mother.
My real mother.
She took me to a house with a man who said he was my father.
They never hugged me,
nor told me why for ten years I had thought they were dead.
I don't know if they're my parents.
So, if I don't even know that,
how can I know if I believe in God?
Or in marriage? Or anything?
Forgive me, Marcela...
I didn't know.
-I'm going to class. -I'm sorry.
Will you forgive me?
Good evening. I'm Elisa, Marcela's classmate.
I'm Elisa, Marcela's classmate. She lent me this book this morning and I came to give it back. Can I...
She lent me this book this morning and I came to give it back. Can I...
-I'll give it to her. -Thank you.
-Good night. -Good night.
From that classmate of yours.
You left it behind, she said.
Some books bring us nothing good.
"Dear Marcela,
I would never deliberately hurt you.
I swear.
Believe me.
Believe me and forgive me.
Yours, Elisa."
"Yours, Elisa."
Marcela.
Your father is wrong.
Books...
What?
What about books?
I read in secret...
when your father doesn't see me.
That's not true.
Emilia Pardo Bazán.
THE BURNING QUESTION
-I dreamt... -I dreamt...
-You first. -No, you.
I had a dream about you.
No way.
I had a dream about you.
Really?
Yes.
You won't tell me your dream?
No.
Never.
And you?
Me neither.
Do you know something I've been thinking my whole life?
What?
Sometimes I walk here.
I go close to the water.
Then I close my eyes and dream.
You dream?
I dream that I'm riding a horse,
and I cross the sea.
Then I reach the shore...
and it's Argentina.
And I keep riding the horse for a long time...
without getting tired.
It's an absurd dream, because I've never ridden a horse and...
I'm very scared of the sea.
But... What are you doing?
This is real, isn't it?
It isn't a dream?
It isn't this cold in dreams.
You should go. It's a long way back to school.
I don't mind.
See you tomorrow.
Marcela, I...
-There are so many things-- -Elisa.
They're waiting for me inside.
Let me tell you one.
What?
If I died right now,
that moment with you in the sea...
would be the happiest moment of my life.
One day, I'll buy you a horse.
Let her go.
-She’ll stay to take care of you. -She's studying. -I'm fine, really. -Enough.
-I'm fine, really. -Enough.
No way. Don't even think about going to school today.
Why not?
You'll look after your mother, she's not well.
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine. Let her go.
Marcela is staying here today.
That's final.
In Portugal, there are three main natural regions,
the north, the center, and the south,
which consists of the Alentejo and the Algarve.
The northern region
is located between the Minho Province and the Serra da Estrela.
You know something?
My body is covered in moles.
And one day...
will you let me see them?
Wait here.
"Darkness didn't allow anything to be seen other than its imposing outline,
hiding the lines and details in the darkness of the night."
Who's this? What is she doing here?
This is Elisa.
She brought me my homework.
Seeing as I didn't go to school today.
Leave.
Daughter.
You and I need to talk.
About what?
-I can't miss class. -Yes, you can.
As your education is so important to you,
your mother and I are sending you to boarding school... in Madrid.
It's a good place, my child.
You'll learn a lot more than you will here.
In three years, you'll be a teacher.
Boarding school or a convent, you decide.
I would have chosen a convent, but your mother insisted.
-Where are you going? -Let go!
Get off! Let go of me!
-Stop it right there! -Let go!
Let go of me!
Dear Marcela,
Four weeks,
three days, and nine hours
have passed since the last time I could smell you.
Yet, I feel you are so close to me in my thoughts...
that I could almost touch you.
Everything reminds me of you.
Everything.
The children.
My aunt. The nuns.
The sun.
The rain, the sea.
The sand.
This blank paper that I fill with words that take me to you.
The quill.
The ink.
I often dream of you, Marcela.
Even when I'm awake.
I draw you.
And so, wherever I look, I find you.
I miss you so much.
So much.
I want to kiss your mole.
Always yours...
Elisa.
Dear Elisa,
I've just read your letter.
Reading your words is the closest thing to touching you.
Some days, I imagine me by your side while you write.
While you write to me.
And I watch you.
I watch each gesture.
Each word that you give me.
And I look closely at your hands.
At your moles.
At your pauses.
At your haste.
And mine.
I imagine all our letters together as if they were magic charms.
And you and me naked, on top of them.
As if all the words that we've sent each other
could protect us from the cold,
from people,
from the distance.
Whenever one of your letters arrives,
before I open it, I hug it.
I hug you.
And your words calm my impatience,
my fear of not seeing you,
and the fear that one day you'll stop writing.
Your words of love penetrate my skin.
I think that my moles are words from you.
I love you so much, Elisa.
COUSO, GALICIA. THREE YEARS LATER
The chestnut...
is a fruit...
with a reddish shell.
The shape of the chestnut...
is very similar...
to that of a heart.
Draw a chestnut.
Honestly! What did I tell you? Have you finished drawing a chestnut?
I have the quickest kids in all of Couso.
Get back inside!
Who is she?
You.
-You've been with me all this time. -All this time.
-And you've been with me every minute. -Every minute.
You should apply for the school in Couso, ten kilometers from mine.
-Ten kilometers. -Ten kilometers.
Then I'll get them to transfer me with you.
-Yes. -Yes, with you. With me.
-And we'll be together. -And we'll be together.
Together. -Together. -Together. -Together. -Forever.
-Together. -Forever. -Forever. -Forever. Forever.
-I love you. -I love you.
-I love you. -I love you.
Good morning. Good morning!
You may sit down.
CALO, GALICIA. FEBRUARY, 1901
I'm Miss Marcela, what are your names?
I'm Pedro.
I'm Rosa.
My name is Celso.
My name is Rocío.
I'm Rosalía.
And the tree? Do you know what it is called?
THE HOLY TRINITY GOD - HOLY SPIRIT - SON
Look at those two birds.
Can you give us a hand?
-We don't bite. -They're ill-tempered.
The...
body...
of the...
snail...
is...
soft.
I knew you were here.
I always know when you're near.
What's that letter?
My cousin, Mario.
My aunt's son.
He's drowned to death.
Drowned?
I hardly knew him, he always lived in England.
I was his only family.
Shall we eat?
Yes, I'm starving.
May I?
I don't dance.
What do you mean, you don't dance?
Just one.
Don't worry about your friend, I'll ask her next if you want.
Sometimes I feel so scared.
Elisa...
We have to play along.
Pretend we're like everyone else.
That we're just like them.
Or they won't leave us alone.
You know that.
I know.
What a pair.
-Have you seen those two? -Yes. They're having so much fun, you see?
What do you want?
I wanted to ask Miss Marcela to the dance next week.
To go to the dance.
Miss Marcela can't go.
Let the lady tell me.
Or are you in charge of her?
Open the door!
Open the door, you dyke.
Lesbian.
Marcela!
Do you know what's happened to your classmates?
Are they sick?
You may sit down.
Come out!
You know what we have to do, right?
Yes.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Do you love me?
With all my soul.
Marcela, it's not too late to live another life.
A life...
that is normal.
Be quiet.
A normal life for me is with you.
Nobody could ever give me what you do.
Nobody.
Ever.
Afterwards, we'll go to Buenos Aires, where nobody knows us.
Yes.
I haven't seen Elisa in days.
She's left.
Where to, may I ask?
To Havana.
With some relatives.
She's already set sail.
Goodbye. I'm going inside.
Wait.
They say your friend has left.
Yes.
A few days ago.
To Cuba.
Are you by yourself?
And the firewood is running out.
It was Elisa who took care of that.
I could bring some firewood.
Thank you.
Today.
Tonight.
There's a praised island
There at the bottom of the sea
It sails with bright stars
The night makes it...
Mario.
I was born on the same day as my cousin Elisa,
but seven years later,
after my mother had already married an English protestant.
Saint George's Church, A Coruña This can't be, my son. It cannot be!
This can't be, my son. It cannot be!
I know, Father, I know, but the circumstances...
All the records were lost and I was never baptized
All the records were lost and I was never baptized because my stepfather, Mr. Hobbs, was opposed it.
When I was eight, they took me to England, and after that...
Do you know what my dream is, Father?
My only dream now that I'm finally home is...
to be baptized, and then marry Marcela.
Immediately, my son. Tomorrow.
-Really, Father? -Yes.
JUNE, 1901
Mario...
Do you take Marcela, here present, to be your lawfully wedded wife,
Do you take Marcela, here present, to be your lawfully wedded wife, according to the rite of our Holy Mother Church?
If so, answer "I do."
I do.
Marcela...
Do you take Mario, here present, to be your lawfully wedded husband,
according to the rite of our Holy Mother Church?
If so, answer "I do."
I do.
I now declare you man and wife,
in the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
Amen.
What can I do for you?
Marcela, my child...
we heard that you got married.
Yes, Father.
In A Coruña.
At St. George's Church.
Father Cortiella married us.
And... could we meet your husband?
He's resting.
It will just be a moment.
Look, Marcela...
We have been told that...
as strange as this sounds...
that you are married to...
to Elisa.
To Elisa dressed as a man.
That's absurd!
To Elisa dressed as a man?
That's why you're all here?
His name is Mario.
He's Elisa's cousin.
They're first cousins, they look very alike.
They're almost identical.
-Anything else? -You should ask him to come out.
I ought to...
examine him.
Examine him closely.
Why do you meddle in other people's lives?
Is there no one who needs their last rites or treatment for a cold?
Want to know something, Father?
Something that persuades you that Mario is a man, and you as well.
In a few months, you'll see for yourself.
I'm having a baby.
Mario's child,
my husband's child.
I hope you will baptize him, Father.
Now leave.
The weather is turning quite nasty.
We'll have to leave sooner than we thought.
If only we could go to Buenos Aires tomorrow.
I'm tired, I'm going to lie down.
Elisa, come out if you're a man!
Come out, you whore!
Whore! Come out, you whore!
Whore!
Whore!
PASSENGER LIST
I suppose you know why I sent for you.
They're lies, Father.
Nothing but lies.
People in Dumbría invent all kinds of things to damge our reputation.
It's a blatant lie.
Do you realize the position you've put me in?
Do you realize that what you two have done...
is a complete lie?
And that you and that wretched woman will both rot in hell!
Father, please.
I have no choice...
but to do this, Mario,
or whoever the hell you are!
Guards!
Father, I'll begin.
Don't do this, Father, please.
I beg you, don't do this.
If you are a man... prove it.
Please.
No!
I'm a hermaphrodite, I swear! I'm a hermaphrodite!
Damn you, woman.
The fury of all the archangels
shall fall on you and on your...
on that woman!
She's my wife...
and her name is Marcela.
Read the story of Elisa and Marcela,
a marriage without a man.
Look at this.
This isn't what human beings do.
Did you see this? What about the priest?
Good evening.
Okay, all in order.
You can go. Good night. You may go on.
Good night. Thank you.
PORTO. DECEMBER, 1901
The chicken! In the oven!
The cod is ready!
Hey, hey!
What's this? Wake up!
How much are we short?
We've got enough for one fare.
In two months...
Two months.
Severa has passed away
Severa has passed away
And the streets of Mouraria
Weep with anger and pain
And the streets of Mouraria
Weep with anger and pain
A black shawl, a black shawl
Black like the new moon
A black shawl, a black shawl
Black like the new moon
As black as the darkest night
As black as the darkest night
You two are under arrest in the name of the Portuguese government.
She hasn't done anything!
She hasn't done anything!
Be careful, she's...
Shut up and keep moving!
Come on, walk!
Here I have a lawsuit from the Court of A Coruña...
which says that you are a woman called Elisa,
and that, with a false identity,
you managed to get married to Marcela...
and entered Portugal.
I'm Mario.
Please, I don't have all day.
What is this comedy that you and this woman have concocted?
That woman is my wife.
You Spaniards are always so stubborn, so pig-headed, so loud-mouthed.
Please, sir, she... my wife...
has nothing to do with all this.
She knows nothing.
She thinks that I'm a hermaphrodite, that I...
Please, stop,
Elisa, Mario, whatever your name is.
I'm not an ignorant parish priest from a village in Galicia
who you and your friend can fool that easily.
If I tell the guards right now...
to take you to the men's prison cell,
how long do you think it will take them to find out what you are?
How long?
Not long...
I guess.
Are you pregnant?
Come.
Come here.
Eat.
What will happen to us?
What are we accused of?
Transvestism.
Blasphemy.
Falsifying documents.
And your friend is accused of being an accomplice.
That's just across the border.
But first, you have to answer the charges on this side.
You'll be tried here,
and then transferred to Galicia.
It's all my fault. Marcela is innocent, I swear.
She's expecting a child.
A child?
Put a dress on.
I'll tell them to put you in the women's building.
Can I be with her?
Yes.
Thank you.
You're a good person.
You're welcome.
That's what my wife says when she's about to upset me.
Go, go, go.
Leave.
Before I regret it
and lock you up with those savages.
Go on.
Marcela.
Mario.
I'm Elisa.
Elisa.
What's going to happen now?
I don't know.
But we're together.
Together, yes.
Forgive me.
I said I would protect you...
-and look where we are. -No, Elisa, shh.
You don't have to apologize.
We'll get out of here.
We should have left a long time ago.
Maybe.
I'm scared that our baby will be born here.
The warden will help us.
He seems to be a good man.
We need more than just a good man.
Keep still.
Perfect.
Ready?
Have you read about those two women that got married?
If we send them back to Spain, they'll be sentenced to prison for 20 years.
It was made with great affection. Please give this to them.
Of course, I'll deliver it to them.
I have a gift for the child of the Spanish women. Please give them this.
It brings good luck.
That's enough touching. Let's have some order here.
Elisa...
It's coming!
Are you sure?
Yes.
There's the head. It's coming! Breathe.
Breathe.
Look, here it comes! Go, push.
Push hard! Come on!
Now, this is it. One last time!
So much hair! Right?
Hello.
Oh, nice and healthy.
A girl. It's a girl.
What's her name?
-Ana. -Oh, she's beautiful.
GOVERNOR'S PALACE, PORTO
Commissioner, what's this story about the two Spanish women that got married?
My wife won't stop going on about it.
She even wants to visit them in prison.
They've had a lot of visitors,
that is true.
The Spanish authorities are pressuring me.
They want to try them in A Coruña.
I think they want to make an example of them both.
They're not criminals, they're two women who are--
Stupid.
This cod is so bland.
What's the current situation?
One of them gave birth to a baby girl in prison.
Gave birth in prison?
Just what we needed.
Governor...
If we hand them over to the Spanish authorities,
they'll get ten to 20 years in jail.
Can I count on your esteemed help so that doesn't happen?
Done legally, of course.
Even if it's just to annoy the Spanish.
Your Excellency, count on me.
Try this cod and tell me if it isn't bland.
No, thank you, Governor.
We have enough for both fares, Marcela.
As soon as we get out of here...
If we leave here, they'll hand us over to the authorities.
Something's wrong with her.
It's the humidity...
and this place.
Give her to me.
No.
What's wrong?
She's burning up.
A doctor!
We need a doctor!
It's the baby! A doctor!
Shh, calm down.
The baby has pneumonia.
We have to lower her fever or she'll die.
They can come with me to my house.
Let's go to my house.
-Well? -How are they?
I think she's out of danger.
Now they're sleeping.
The baby is very beautiful.
I can't thank you enough for everything you've done for us.
It's a privilege to have met you.
Most people wouldn't say that.
We're not most people.
Right?
Right.
You don't have children?
No.
I can't detain you two any longer, Elisa.
But if I let you go, you'll be deported.
I know.
If I were to let you go... This is only an example.
...the day before the boat leaves.
And on the release papers, I put a date of, let's say...
two days later.
But first we have to let them recover.
Yes.
Oh, you earn more.
More money coming in.
The others don't matter.
We have to find a way to resolve things.
Where's Ana?
She's with Flor.
I asked her to take care of her until we're ready.
Marcela, are you okay?
Is something wrong?
I thought you'd be happy that we're leaving.
I am.
Believe me.
You don't seem it.
Soon we'll be out of this prison.
This prison is fine.
The problem is what's outside.
Where we are carnival freaks.
Where people stare at us.
Where they laugh at us.
Where there's no escape.
And there never will be.
That's why we got married and came up with Mario.
That's why I had my daughter.
I thought they'd believe us then.
How could I do this to my daughter?
How could I?
-My love... -Elisa.
Listen to me.
Despite the fact that I love you more than my own life,
if you choose to stay here with your daughter, I'll understand.
I'll wait for you forever, Marcela. Forever.
Don't you understand?
She's the one I'm leaving behind. Her.
Thank you.
Elisa, tell her that we'll tell the child who her mother is.
Yes, I'll tell her.
Look after her...
and look after yourself.
I hated you, you know?
For many years.
-I can imagine. -But they were very good parents.
The best.
I knew they would be.
Was it worth it?
All this?
The wedding, the mockery?
Going to prison?
Abandoning me?
Was it worth it?

-Get off him! -What the fuck?
-You're such a stupid fuck! -What'd you just call me?
[girl] I called you a stupid fuck, you stupid fuck.
Hey, don't touch her!
Hey, I don't need your help, okay?
That's all you're gonna do? Out here by yourself, teach me a lesson?
You got held back, didn't you, Kenny? Twice, I think.
You think that's funny?
No, I think it's very sad, actually.
I only mention it because that would make you over 18.
If you were to beat me up, which I'm sure you could, it would be child abuse.
So if you don't want to wind up on some registry, I suggest you back the fuck--
Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?
I'm looking at homework here for at least 15 different students.
Are we really not gonna discuss that I have an ice pack on my face?
Nurse says you'll be fine.
So no interest in why a teacher found me sprawled out on the ground?
Mia Sutton says she saw you walk into a beam out back.
How do you think we found you?
All right. I get it. I'm in trouble. All I'm trying to say is,
you have the chance to stop the people who make things hard for everybody.
You gotta see the big picture here.
Light...
some people might look at you, a kid in your situation,
losing your mom the way you did,
and they'd cut you a little slack when it comes to these behavioral issues.
Well, I don't believe in that.
Detention. Two weeks. Get out of here.
Hey.
Oh! Hi. I'm awake.
I was just like a tree or a plant or something.
I'm heading out for a moment. Don't fall asleep or it adds another day.
"Rule one: The human whose name is written in this note shall die."
"Rule two: This note will not take effect
unless the writer has the person's face in their mind
when writing his or her name."
Hello?
Help! Help me! Help! Help!
Holy shit! Holy shit!
What the fuck?! [whimpering]
[male voice] Shall we begin?
Okay.
Relax, Light.
You're asleep.
You're asleep and you're dreaming of some eight-foot-tall,
demon-looking motherfucker.
[creature] Oh, yes.
A dream. I like that.
Dreams are places you can have fun, right?
It's all in your mind, so why not enjoy it? -[girl shrieks outside] -Shh.
Listen.
[girl] Get off of me!
Go, check it out.
-[girl] No! -[Kenny] Come on! Come on!
[boy] What?
[girl]Kenny, no! Let me go! Get off me!
You're so disgusting! Get the fuck off of me!
-Ooh! While you're down there... -Aw, it sucks to be you.
[creature] Now we could, in this dream of yours,
take care of a situation like this.
We just put Kenny's name down...
and see what happens.
[whispers] Yeah.
-Nah. -[girl] Get off! You're such assholes!
[creature] I know you want to.
Go on.
Help her.
I don't have a pen.
It's a good thing you have a pen.
Good. Now as long as we're playing, let's do it right.
There's no need to stop at "who."
I'm sorry. What else is there?
How.
For a beginner, not bad at all.
Now...
watch.
Give it back!
Now listen. I need to separate the wheat from the chaff.
I think you might be capable of great things,
but if you don't think you can handle it, that's fine.
Just put the note somewhere,
leave it alone for seven days, and I'll find it a new home.
How can this be possible?
It happened. Just like that.
And if this is possible, imagine what else you could do.
-He a friend of yours? -Who?
Kid in the accident.
Oh. No, I don't think he was a friend of anyone.
Want to talk about it?
No.
We should talk about why you were still at school.
Oh, yeah, that wasn't a big deal.
I just wrote a couple papers and then got detention.
You don't think cheating's a big deal? That who you are?
No, um...
Actually, I only got caught because I was trying to break up a...
Know what? Doesn't matter. You wouldn't understand anyway.
Because you're just that smart or I'm just that dumb?
Because this is what you do. Instead of trying to solve real problems,
you look over people's shoulders so you can bust them for bullshit,
you look over people's shoulders so you can bust them for bullshit, like not turning in their reports or whatever.
A gun is only good as its aim, son.
I make sure people can trust our aim.
Just once, it would be nice to think that you actually...
I mean, you're a cop. How do you sleep at night
knowing you watched while a guy like Antony Skomal walked away?
You think I just watched?
If I was a cop and some guy ran over my wife,
I'd be pretty pissed off if his dad paid his way out of jail.
He killed my mom, he nearly beat his girlfriend to death,
and you just sit there saying the same bullshit
-about how people better trust your aim-- -I'm gonna assume you're still raw
by what you saw today at school,
and that's keeping you from thinking before you speak.
I suggest you stop talking.
"Rule 64: Each page of the note contains the power of the whole note."
"Rule 95: Anyone may write names in the note,
but only the keeper can possess it for more than seven days." Jesus!
How many rules does it take to...
"Don't trust Ryuk.
He is not your pet. He is not your friend." -[thunder rumbles] -[train whistle blows]
-[Ryuk] Hey, kid. -Ah!
It's pronounced Ree-yook.
Ryuk.
Oh. Hi.
Sorry for the mispronunciation.
Ryuk, what exactly can I do with thisDeath Note?
What exactly did you have in mind?
Well, it says that I can specify the manner of death.
If I can choose how they die, does that mean I can actually control them?
Every human spends the last moments of his life in the shadow of a death god.
If we so desire, we can influence those moments.
There are, of course, limitations.
"Rule 20:
A subject can be influenced for no more than two days leading up to his death."
Two days? Your fingers are huge.
"Rule 28: Each death must be physically possible,"
so no shark attacks while someone's on the toilet.
As much as I love that idea.
Uh, where did it come from?
[sighs] The history of the note is as long as history itself.
But who gave it to me? I mean, did you give it to me?
The last keeper of the note passed away. It fell to me to find a new one.
-What if I didn't want it? -You may pass it on.
Or better yet, I will.
-How would you do that? -I told you!
When the note is separated from the keeper for seven days,
I find a new one.
Who wrote those warnings about you in the margins?
Oh, is that what we're gonna do with the note, Light? Rules and warnings?
The name and the face is all you have to have.
[Light's father] Turner.
Yeah, no, it's fine. What's going on?
Say that again.
You gotta be kidding me.
All right, yeah. I'll see you in a bit.
All right.
-[knock on door] -Hey.
[Light] Hey, uh, one second.
Come in.
Hey, what you up to?
Uh, just fell asleep on my desk.
I just got a call.
Our friend Antony Skomal is no more.
Impaled himself on a steak knife in the middle of a restaurant.
-Holy shit. -[chuckles] Yeah.
You seem happy.
Probably shouldn't be, but yeah, I am.
Your mom...
she always was kind of a hippy.
And we didn't see eye to eye on everything.
She was damn sure right about one thing.
Karma's a bitch.
Sorry about what I said... you know.
Love you, son.
I love you, too.
-[man 1] Go, go! -[man 2] Yeah! Watch your feet!
[girl] You in mourning?
In... Uh, what?
Our friend Kenny.
Oh, yeah. It's terrible what happened to Kenny.
You don't have to lie to me. Kenny was a sociopath,
and just because he's dead does not make it a tragedy.
-Right. -I just wish I'd seen it.
I heard his head spun all the way around.
Actually, his head exploded into a million pieces.
-In case you're wondering. -You saw it?
-I'm Mia. -Oh, hi.
I know that you're Mia, actually. I already knew that.
I know that you're Light Turner. I already knew that.
Yeah.
You knew that I'm... You know my name?
So are you gonna tell me what you saw, Light Turner?
Why did you get me put into detention?
I'm sorry.
I, uh... thought you could use some medical attention
and I wasn't aware of the fact that you were carrying around
a stockpile of illegal papers in your backpack.
Is that one of them? Hmm? Oh, no.
"Death Note"? What is it?
-What is what? -Your book.
Uh, I can't tell you.
-Okay. -Do you really want to know?
-Sure. -Okay, then I'll tell you. I just...
Follow me.
Please tell me this isn't your poetry journal.
When you see him, try not to freak out. I freaked out a little.
See... who?
Behind you.
It's okay.
What are you talking about? [Ryuk] Only the keeper of the note can see me.
"The human whose name is written in this note... shall die."
-Your poetry sucks. -It's not poetry.
Um, will you just read the last entry?
"Kenny Doyle decapitation"?
I have, and...
I'm gonna sound crazy, but I have a death god.
-I'm gonna get out of here. -No. No, don't go. Trust me.
You of all people are gonna want to see this.

-Okay. Watch. -Police are now confirming the hostages

[male reporter] With his violent history, police are hesitant
about moving in on this situation.
You stupid bitch! You fucking stay there, you snot-nose little douchebag!
[male reporter] It appears that James Brode is exiting the storefront.
[female reporter] It looks like he has released her. That's definitely a good sign.
-[gasps] Holy shit. -[male reporter] Oh, my goodness.
[female reporter] Uh, folks, we are trying to get more information.
I hope no children were watching this.
This is obviously very upsetting footage.
In case you're just tuning in, the man holding his family hostage
just saluted to cameras before being run over by a rogue SWAT truck.
We apologize for these disturbing images...
I killed him.
[Light] I guess I should feel guilty, but I don't.
[Mia] That woman and her kids are only alive right now because of what you did.
What is there to feel guilty about?
Thing is, I know what it's like to get fucked over.
Some asshole killed my mom and...
got away with it until I got this book.
I just keep thinking, I mean, why should it just be for me?
I mean, all the people that make life miserable, make life dangerous...
I can reach them now.
Do you think that I'm crazy?
If anything, I think you're not crazy enough.
-We could change the world. -"We"?
Like "we" as... as in us?
[male reporter] We're getting an update live...
The police are extremely hesitant...
Can I kiss you?
You're not supposed to ask.
What am I supposed to do?
[Light] The note was filled with names when I got it.
Whoever had it before us, what did they accomplish?
Just small-time killings, revenge, petty crimes?
I think we can do a lot more than just settle some random scores.
How about this guy?
I don't want people to say they're scared of it or horrified.
[Mia] What do you want them to say?
[Light] I want them to say... "Thank you."
Look at those people.
-[Mia] They're a bunch of sheep. -[Light] No, they're not.
They're looking for someone who's not gonna let them down
They're looking for someone who's not gonna let them down the way cops do and politicians.
And that's why they have you.
[Light] It's bigger than me. It's bigger than us.
What they want...
is a god.
So let's give it to them.
Let's give them a god, let's make a name for him.
A god that never lets anybody down.
It's not gonna solve a few crimes, it's gonna solve all crime.
[Mia] A god that scares the shit out of the bad guys
until they don't want to be bad anymore?
[Light] A god who inspires hope that things can actually change.
Kira.
Kira? What does that mean?
It means "light" in Russian and Celtic.
Wouldn't you be worried they could trace it back to you?
No. How could they?
It also sort of means "killer" in Japanese,
so if they're looking, it's gonna be on the wrong continent.
[female reporter] Who or what is Kira?
That's the question facing baffled investigators today
as death row inmates in six different continents were found dead in their cells. Each victim left behind the same message written in perfect Japanese.
Each victim left behind the same message written in perfect Japanese.
[in Mandarin] It reads, "Lord Kira has returned to punish the wicked."
None of the victims actually spoke Japanese...
[Mia] I think I got one.
[reporter in German] Reports are that the previously elusive leader
of the terrorist movement blew himself up in front of his men.
Kira is apparently behind the bizarre deaths.
[reporter in Spanish] Five members of the cartel apparently threw themselves
in front of an oncoming train.
Kira is responsible for all of these acts
that are happening right now.
[man in English] The globalists will have you believe that Kira's the New World Messiah here to right the wrongs of our time.
that Kira's the New World Messiah here to right the wrongs of our time.
This is another bid by the super elites to sweep the rug from under us
and shape our reality by what can only be described
and shape our reality by what can only be described as one of the greatest false flag operations in the history of covert ops.
as one of the greatest false flag operations in the history of covert ops.
[female reporter] Fear they will be punished by Kira
has led to a series of wanted criminals literally turning themselves in.
Kira's had a bigger impact on crime than anything I've seen.
I don't wanna say our job's gotten easier, but look around you.
[female reporter] News out of Japan tonight where Kira has apparently struck again.
More than a dozen were found dead in a Tokyo nightclub,
a scene authorities described as "incredibly gruesome."
What can anyone tell us about Kira?
And perhaps, more importantly, can anyone stop it?
And should they?
[in Japanese] It makes no sense.
The Nakamuras and the Inagawas have had a truce for over ten years.
How would Kira even know about them?
-[L] Because I tipped him off. -What?
I've had access to law enforcement databases for some time.
I've been seeding the names of obscure criminals,
waiting for a hit.
And now... we know who we're looking for.
[man in English] How long since you've slept?
Forty-one hours.
And you're certain of your conclusions?
Yes. [hums softly]
The insulin spike from the candies will focus your mind for final consideration.
When it fades, you will sleep for one hour.
Wear these to properly prepare your body clock.
I've been contemplating several different strategies.
I honestly don't know that I'll be able to sleep.
-Sleep is key to strong thought. -Yes.
Would you mind singing a song for me?
Of course.

♪ You're out of the night ♪

Investigation, since when? And why are you just telling me this now?
Because I just got added last week.
Knowing you'd have this sort of calm and thoughtful response,
I can't imagine why I didn't bring it up sooner.
What part of terrorists killing each other
and criminals turning themselves in bothers you, Dad?
Why exactly are they doing that, son?
-They're doing it because of Kira. -Right, and who is that?
How does Kira get to decide who lives and dies, who's guilty and innocent?
Is there a complaints department if I don't like one of Kira's decisions?
Or would complaining get me put on Kira's list?
Is that what everybody at the station thinks?
Well, it's safe to say I'm ahead of the curve on that one.
Hey, how do I look?
-Good. -All right. See you this afternoon.
-Turner. -[man] Just got a call from the FBI.
Apparently, they got someone who wants to speak with you.
-Oh, yeah? And who is that? -They're not really saying.
Just said he helped them out before
and he's got a theory on the Kira situation.
-I just got the case. What does he want? -I have no idea.
They said he's a little different.
In fact, they'll probably send a representative...
[man] Detective Turner?
I am to meet with Detective Turner,
local head of the Kira investigation, in his office at 9:00 a.m.
Call you back.
-What can I do for you? -I am Watari.
Your fellow officers did that?
Cops don't like it when you go after other cops,
but, apparently, they hate it when you go after their god.
They support Kira?
Kira's doing away with the "Most Wanted" list.
These guys wanna throw him a parade.
But now that rumor has it Kira's a cop, it's in my world.
The idea that Kira is associated with law enforcement is not a rumor.
It is a fact,
uncovered by the individual I work with.
-Oh, yeah, and who's that? -He goes by the letter "L."
L is real?
You're familiar?
Yeah, I hear things.
That giant smuggling ring in Eastern Europe,
practically handed to police on a platter.
L would like to speak with you regarding the Kira investigation.
-Okay. When? -Right now.
-[L] Hmm, Detective Turner. -What is this?
A one-time offer.
I'd like to assist you in the capture of Kira.
Why me? The FBI, CIA have hundreds of men on this.
I've been in communication with Interpol and the FBI,
but I believe you have something they do not.
What's that?
An in-depth understanding of potential suspects.
Why would I have a better understanding?
The FBI thinks the killer is operating out of Japan.
Because of the name Kira.
Ah, but the name is an intentional misdirection.
He wants us to believe that he's Japanese, operating a half a world away.
He's not.
Kira's in Seattle.
Shall we help one another?
"Justice for the Wicked." What is this?
It's a site for Kira worshipers.
They put up names of people that deserve to die.
[Light] Holy shit.
[Mia] Rapists, pedophiles,
human trafficking, murder.
This guy killed four people in a house fire.
I don't know. How do we know that it's real?
What do you mean?
What if somebody fucked your girlfriend and you put him on the list to kill him?
What would you do if some guy fucked me?
-[stammers] Oh, I'd kill him. -Yeah?
-Yeah. -You'd kill him?
-Yeah. -You'd kill him?
But that is the reason why we can't kill people based on website rumors.
It's not like that.
These are real people with real problems, and they've been ignored.
They need our help.
[Light's father] Figured you'd be older.
And that I'd be able to see more of your face.
Yes, well, I find I'm not in a very trusting mood these days.
I took the liberty of moving your evidence to a more secure location.
Oh, I can see that. Were you gonna let me know or...?
Wow, this is very, very impressive, James. Your men must be proud.
Ask your partner how my men think about me these days.
So you did all of this yourself?
Even more impressive.
Please, James, have a seat. Rest your glutes.
Mm-mmm. You've made two mistakes.
This is zero day, Kira's first recorded murders.
But previously, on April 15th, convicted felon James W. Brode
had taken his wife and children hostage.
I remember that. You think that was Kira?
[L] Initial speculation was that his behavior was drug-related,
but lost in the ensuing crush of Kira activities
was the fact that Brode's toxicology had come back clean.
The stand-off had never made national news,
and it was only broadcast on local Seattle stations.
-So that's how you knew he was here. -I infiltrated your network
in order to ensure that there hadn't been a data breach. Prior to my access, the network was intact.
Did you just hand me evidence you hacked the Seattle P.D.?
I handed you evidence that whoever Kira is,
they have access to the database from the inside.
Kira's one of ours.
Here's a cross-reference list of officers and their access
as well as the dates of Kira activities.
The Federal Administration has agreed to make resources available to us.
We can begin seeing who was where when.
-What are you gonna do? -I'd like to start by speaking with Kira.
Sure you are. [low chuckle]
-Hey. -Light, turn on the news.
The individual known as Kira,
as I'm sure you're aware, has taken credit for over 400 deaths.
Oh, shit.
While we don't know how he kills his victims,
we do know how he chooses them.
Prior to these deaths,
all of the victims have had their identities released to the media.
This would suggest that Kira is not some omnipotent force.
He's a person...
like you or me.
He is also a coward.
A child wielding power he does not understand,
mistakenly believing in doing so, he's at no risk to himself.
He's wrong.
Kira, if you're watching this, know that I am coming for you.
Unless, of course, you'd like to kill me right now.
Now I'm rooting for this guy.
Would you shut the fuck up?
No?
Well, in that case, Kira,
I shall be meeting you face-to-face very shortly.
Who does this guy think he is?
What the fuck was that?
I have a theory.
Kira cannot kill by simply sight alone.
He needs a name and a face.
Every victim we've seen so far fits this pattern.
So you antagonize him on purpose?
While withholding my identity from the record.
Now, we know that he wants to kill me but is unable.
And what if you're wrong?
Then, James, I'd be dead.
Either way, we'll have gained valuable information.
He always pull this kind of stuff?
[Light] You guys getting close to catching Kira?
Oh, I'd say the haystack's down to a hay pile. Still a lot of hay.
I saw the press conference today.
Who's that guy on TV with the turtleneck?
You like that look? I'm thinking of taking it myself.
Goes by L. He's an independent investigator.
Wow, so you don't even know his real name.
About the only thing I know is he's got some handler named Watari.
Really likes ice cream.
He's connected an awful lot of dots.
Do you think he's connected the dots because he's Kira?
I don't think so.
He has a history of cracking big cases.
Besides, I think you can tell when you're sitting across from a killer like Kira.
Right. Of course.
What happens when they catch Kira?
Well... he's murdered over 400 people,
so, my guess...
it's probably gonna be a fight between those who want to hang him
and those who want to dissect him and figure out how he did it.
-You okay? -Yeah.
You put someone on my kid?
We agreed that everyone with access needed to be thoroughly vetted.
I did not see it prudent to have you investigate yourself.
What? We're not talking about investigating me.
We're talking about having my son followed!
I investigated you prior to offering my assistance
and concluded you are not Kira.
As for your son, he may have access to databases
around which we have centered our search.
Therefore, deserves the same scrutiny as anyone else that fits that criteria.
-No, he's a kid! -Yes.
-A particularly bright kid. -You know what?
If you had any questions about my son, you should've come to me.
[woman] Here you go.
[Light] Even if they're suspicious, I don't see how they can prove it.
I think we just go quiet until they stop following us.
-What do you mean "go quiet"? -Stop fucking around with theDeath Note.
Is that what you think we're doing?
Come on, Light. Just get rid of them. All we need is a name.
-I'm not gonna do that. -Not gonna do what?
-I was talking to Ryuk. -I like this one, Light.
-She has wonderful ideas. -What'd he say?
Ryuk? Not much.
-We're good. They're trying to stop us. -We don't kill innocent people, Mia.
Even if I wanted to, which I don't, taking out the guy following us will only indicate that it's me.
You'd have to get rid of all the agents, regardless of who they're following.
They wouldn't know who it was,
but they'd know what happens when you fuck with Kira.
-Can't believe you're saying this. -Cant believe you're not.
Then I guess we're really fucking lucky that it's my book.
[female reporter] Kira has been strangely inactive of late,
something authorities are eager to point to
as evidence their investigation is gaining momentum.
However, Kira supporters have begun to criticize police
for suppressing its activities,
as a small but noticeable spike in global crime
has become apparent in the absence of recent activities from the phenomena.
[Light] Are you leaving?
Yeah, I've got some work to do.
There's a guy on the news who killed a couple kids.
I thought maybe we could make some popcorn, take some names down for later.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Director Pearl. These just came in from the field offices.
Tell them to keep surveillance on all the potential--
Assistant Director Pearl is dead. Heart attack, just now.
We need to contact every FBI agent on their team.
This is Franks.
Agent Franks, your team has been compromised.
Drop what you're doing and get to the nearest hospital. Right now.
Agent Franks?
Agent Franks, can you hear me?
[female reporter] Twelve FBI agents mysteriously commit suicide.
Some sources say it was the work of Kira.
This is the first time Kira has attacked law enforcement.
-[Mia] Slow down for one second? -He did it! Son of a bitch killed them.
-Ryuk? -There's so many rules in that thing!
There must be some kind of loophole.
What's he gonna do if you go after him?
Maybe you just need to take a minute and relax
and see if this was the best thing that could've happened.
No.
[Light] Ryuk!
[Ryuk] You think I'm some dog, Light?
You can just snap your fingers and I'll come running? [chewing]
-Did you kill those FBI agents? -What do you think?
I decide who dies, you obey me. Those are the rules.
-Who do you think wrote the rules? -Whose side are you on?
There are no sides, only the game.
And I knew eventually you wouldn't be able to handle playing.
I asked politely, but you didn't hear me.
Let the note go.
Look at the strife it's causing you and your little girlfriend.
Let me find it a new home. We'll be free of each other.
I'm not gonna give the note to you or anybody else,
and if you fuck with me again, I'm gonna put your name in it.
You could try. [laughs]
But I warn you, there are four letters in my name.
Most anyone's ever gotten were two.
[male reporter] We interrupt this to take you live to an announcement...
-What the fuck is he doing? -...by James Turner,
local head of the Kira investigation.
Oh, shit.
Those of you that harbored any illusions about what Kira really is,
the cold-blooded murder of a dozen FBI agents
should lay bare his true nature.
Kira is a cowardly criminal thug concerned only with self-preservation.
Not only is he unworthy
of the veneration and celebration he's received in certain circles,
as of today, he's not even worthy of our fear.
Understand this, Kira.
You may strike me down, but another one will stand up and take my place.
Why would he do that? He's forcing Kira to retaliate.
...and another for as long as need be.
We will not waiver.
-Because he's not afraid. -We will not submit.
And we will not fail.
Where is it?
What? Are you out of your mind? That's my fucking dad!
Yeah, and he just dared us to kill him on live television.
Think people are gonna be on their knees if he can talk to Kira like that?
We're not killing my dad! This is over! Ryuk fucked us!
We're not the good guys anymore.
[Mia] What happened to the boy that wanted the world to get what he got?
Think about your mom, Light.
Either Kira stands up or they hunt us down.
If you want out, then just get the fuck out!
So you just want to quit?
I don't know.
Well said, James. Tell me, are you truly ready to give your life?
If that's what it takes.
How long will it take him to decide, I wonder?
[James] What's going on?
[sighs] Let me take this.
-Turner. -This is L.
Just making sure you hadn't died.
[sighs] Still here.
Excellent. Carry on.
I'm really proud of you.
[James on TV] Understand this, Kira.
-You may strike me down... -Sir?
-...but another will take my place. -Light Turner is Kira.
-And another and another... -How long since you've slept?
-...for as long as need be. -Thirty-one hours.
-We will not waiver. We will not submit. -Sleep is key to strong thought.
-Trust me. -And we will not fail.
Nothing's gonna change once I wake up.
Hello, Light.
You're the guy. You're L.
Yeah, well, it's not my real name.
But I'm sure you're painfully aware of that.
What are you doing here?
Following a lead. You?
Um... I was just... I'm leaving.
I wonder if it was a difficult decision.
If what was a difficult decision?
Sparing your father's life.
Sorry, what are you talking about?
You must've known it would implicate you, yet you couldn't bring yourself to do it.
I'll admit, I always wondered if you had a line.
I guess it's fortunate for us,
the line you finally decided to draw points so clearly in your direction.
-So you really think I'm Kira. -No, I know it.
If you're so sure, why haven't you just arrested me?
Because I don't do check, Light. Only checkmate.
-But we'll be there soon enough. -Great. Until then, enjoy the gelato.
Assuming you can eat through that thing. And I'll just, uh...
Can I ask you something?
Yeah.
How do you think he does it? Kira.
I was hoping you could shed some light on that for me.
I have a theory.
I think that it's some form of remote viewing
coupled with maybe some latent psychic ability of some sort. Am I close?
So you really have no idea, do you?
Well, I have several ideas.
Eventually, you'll tell me which is correct.
What if it turned out that all arresting Kira did
was give that power to someone else, someone potentially much worse.
You're suggesting the ability is somehow transferable.
I'm suggesting maybe what you and the person you're after want isn't so different.
Maybe they're as ready to see the killing end as you are.
And if that were true, perhaps now would be a good time
to start helping them instead of hunting them.
Helping...
You know what I think, Light? I think you want to make a deal.
Good deals are made by those in a position of strength.
Criminals, such as yourself, never make those deals.
What they do is wait until they're caught and then they beg.
I'm not begging. I'm telling you that you don't understand.
Let me put this in terms you're more familiar with.
A man kills 400 people.
He tells us that it's complicated, that he's misunderstood.
Do you think that Kira would hear his excuses or walk him off a bridge?
Think you're better than me, but you're trying to kill Kira!
-Kira, Kira, Kira! -I do not kill, Light!
I don't even carry a gun, it's distracting.
What I do is bring people to justice.
But the form it takes is their own making. A consequence of their actions, not mine.
You're the one who flew into the sun.
I'm just here to make sure you actually burn.
-Well, if that's how it has to be. -It is, Light!
You know that as well as I do. There are no draws in this game.
-Please, you have to forgive me. -It was my dad, Mia.
If I could take it back, I would. I promise. I was just scared.
Do you think I'm not scared?
I'm a fucking cheerleader, Light.
Nothing I do has ever mattered until I met you.
I made a mistake. If I could take it back, I would. I just...
I wasn't ready to lose you.
I love you.
I love you.
L showed me his face.
I'm gonna get his name, and I'm gonna stop him.
That's Watari. He's L's right-hand man.
If anybody's gonna give us L's real name, it's gonna be him.
All right.
[Light] "Watari becomes obsessed
with revealing the true identity of the detective known as 'L.'
For the next 48 hours, he will cease all communication with the outside world,
except to update what he learns to the number 206-555-0166.
At 7:00 p.m., on October 12th, he dies."
[Ryuk] You didn't say how he dies.
-It doesn't matter, it's dealer's choice. -What?
Huh? Oh, I was talking to Ryuk. Sorry.
-So kill his friend to get his name? -No, I'm not gonna kill Watari.
That's the best part.
Rule 89 says:
"If the person who writes a name destroys its page
prior to the death being carried out, the target will be spared."
So if I burn Watari's page before October 12th at 7:00 p.m...
then nothing bad happens, right, Ryuk?
Only one name can be removed from the Death Note by burning it.
Get this one wrong, you won't get another chance.
I only get one page to burn.
-Hello? -My name is Watari.
-This information is not known to me. -I'm sorry. What do you mean?
I took responsibility for L
only after he left the St. Martin's orphanage in Montauk
where he was one of the Rochester wards.
One of the... Sorry, what is a Rochester ward?
They were orphans trained since childhood
to become the greatest detectives the world had ever seen.
-You've gotta be kidding me. -I am not.
For their first test, the wards were placed in a conditioning vault.
Those who retained their sanity after seven months
were initiated into the program.
L joined at six, the youngest candidate ever.
Okay, but what was his name before the vault or whatever?
That name exists now only in their records.
Okay. Okay. Watari, you need to go there right now.
I should like to rest first.
Sleep is key to strong thought.
No. You don't have any time to sleep. You have 48 hours to get a name.
What happens in 48 hours?
-You just need to go right now. -I will go.
-Leave him alive, it's a loose end. -You don't need to help, Mia.
Of course I do.
I'm not gonna leave you alone in this.
[woman over PA] Continental America from Seattle to New York
will be departing from track three.
[James] I'm telling you, I wore an actual top hat.
-And was that with your wife or...? -No.
Frankly, she wouldn't have been caught within ten miles of me.
I didn't get this cool until much later.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Leave.
What are you doing here?
We have a critical issue that requires discussion immediately.
-Kids, give us a couple minutes. -Sure.
No, wait, wait, wait.
Not you, Light.
The discussion concerns you.
How?
Watari has disappeared.
I've known him my entire life.
He has not, would not, could not leave without me being sure of his plans.
-Okay, let me make a call. -What is it that you want?
-Sorry, I don't have any idea. -I get that this has got you upset.
Your son is Kira, James!
What?
Don't know why you haven't been able to put one and one together,
even despite him having spared your life,
but it does not speak well to your deductive abilities at all.
It's time to leave.
-I'm not going anywhere. -Wanna fucking bet?
I have a search warrant and a team of men outside.
So, as I said, I will be staying. You? You have managed a strong move.
Now, provided that you return Watari to me safely,
I'm willing to put your position of strength into account.
I'm sorry about your friend. I'm sure he'll be fine.
-Damn it! You don't have-- -[both grunting]
You have crossed the line!
Force me to do the same and I assure you you will not survive!
You threaten my son again, I'll fucking kill you!
Get the fuck out of here!
Tear this place apart! Tear it apart!
-You okay? -Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Has nothing to do with you, son.
I knew he was off the minute I met him.
[Ryuk] You know what happens when they find it.
It ends up my book again, Light.
And guess what name I'm gonna suggest we start with when I find it a new home?
Is there...
anything I need to know?
How do you do it?
-How you handle all this? -What do you mean?
How do you handle having everybody against you? You're screwed either way.
Yeah, one way or another, we're all in the middle.
Things are never black and white.
Sometimes you just...
you just have to choose the lesser of two evils.
[Watari] ♪ And the sky ♪
♪ Hold onto your breath Hold onto your heart ♪
♪ Hold onto your heart ♪

He's coming out of the house right now. I want a car on him. Every move.
-Hello. -Where are you? What's taking so long?
-I'm on my way to St. Martin's. -Well, how much longer?
I hope to find it within the next few hours.
Find it? You don't know where it is?
It was never intended to be a place that was easily accessed.
Okay, just hurry.
[woman over PA] This is a reminder.
[woman over PA] This is a reminder. Time is running out to purchase your Winter Dance tickets.
-Hey. -This is for tonight.
Also comes with this. You're really gonna stand out.
You really think I give a shit about Homecoming?
[whispers] Look in the hat.
They're never gonna stop following you.
We're gonna end this once and for all, but I need you to trust me.
-Can you do that? -Yeah.
What do you want, Light?
You're not some sadist.
There's always some flimsy justification, some reason that...
Get me the New York field office. Now!
I've asked Brandon here to dance with me for one. Is that cool with you?
Hey. Where are you?
I've located the records room, but need more time.
Only got a few minutes. Is it there or not?
I am confident it is here, but I cannot yet say where.
Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Forget it. Just forget it.
No! Mia, what did you do? Where's the page?
-Watari, you have to run right now! Okay? -[man] Watari!
You have to run away as quick as you can!
-Someone's here. -Okay...
Just go to them right now and ask for their help.
I am obsessed with revealing the true identity of...
Yes. It's here.
-What does it say that it is? -L's true name...
-What does it say? What is L's real name? -[officer] Sir! Answer me!
Are you Watari?
-I am Watari. -Watari.
Fuck! Fuck!
[Ryuk] Ah, you said dealer's choice.
Why didn't you tell me the page was missing?
But then what would you and Mia have to talk about?
I told you I like her a lot, Light.
I know you're probably upset...
but if you freak out, they're gonna be all over us, -and that's not gonna end well. -You killed him.
-and that's not gonna end well. -You killed him.
[Mia] No, Light.
I saved you...
from yourself again.
Because every time things get hard, you leave me to do the real stuff.
Oh, my God, it was all you. Ryuk never found a loophole. You were the loophole.
You don't get to feel superior for being a pussy.
I did what I had to do... to protect us.
"Agent Raymond Young...
will write the names of all the other agents of the Kira task force
in the Death Note, placing each of their faces in his mind as he goes.
When he's done, he will join them in climbing to a rooftop
and leaping to his death."
If you want out, you're out. All I need is for you to give me the book.
Are you insane? Do you think that I'd ever let you near that thing again?
You didn't read it.
What did you do?
"Light Turner's heart stops beating at midnight."
No... you're trying to kill me?
You're going to officially pass the book to me.
Then once I'm the keeper...
I'll burn your page.
That's why I couldn't let you save Watari. You can only burn one name and...
I wanted it to be yours.
There are so many fucking rules.
Now go get my goddamn book.
Did you find Watari?
This is Detective Turner.

Wait! Wait! Wait!
Didn't I clearly explain what would happen if Watari wasn't safely returned to me?
Wait! You need to understand how it works, okay? Or you can't stop it!
I couldn't stop it! Death can be handed out through a fucking calculus book!
-You're stalling! -No, I'm not! I swear I'm not, okay?
I'm just gonna turn around really slowly.
Okay. I'm gonna reach into my bag.

This man is Kira. I'm working with law enforcement.
-In order to capture and eliminate-- -[man grunts]

Yeah. Yeah.
Out of my way!
Come on! Let's go! Come with me!
Where the fuck is the book, Light?
-Come on! -We're actually closed, guys.
Take us to the top! Nobody else gets on, hear me?
Here. Want the book? Get in!
-What the fuck is your problem? -Take us to the top! Now!
Hit the button!
[Light] We gotta stop doing this. We gotta stop doing all of this.
It's already done!
Let's run away together and never use the Death Note again.
[Mia] I don't want to run away!
Now give me my fucking book, okay?
Take it! But...
just remember what it's done. Not just out there, but to us.
If you love me...
If you love me, then you gotta trust me.
Don't take the book.
Because if you do...
you'll never see me again.
I love you so much.
You do?
-Light! -Dad?
Light!
No!
What?
What?
What did you do?
You put my name in it, didn't you?
It was if you took the book. I thought I could convince you not to.
Are you kidding me, Light?
-You put my name in the book! I got mad. -Are you kidding me?!
You said you love me! I thought you wouldn't take the book!
Light!
Light! Light!
-[Mia screams] -[Light] Oh, shit!
Ryuk! I take it back! I take it back!
Here, just hold on! Don't let go!
Please don't let me go! Don't let me fall!
Four new killings.
And every one of them identified by the news media in the last 48 hours.
I understand you think this means Light cannot be Kira.
You think he's knocking people off while in a coma?
I'm not exactly sure how it is--
Apparently, you have enough highly-placed allies to keep you out of jail.
But none of that's gonna help you if we see you around.
[Light] Wait, you need to understand how it works, okay, or you can't stop it!
I couldn't! Death can be handed out through a fucking calculus book!
Was there a calculus book seized at Light Turner's house?
Did he even take Calculus?
Okay, what about his, uh... his girlfriend?
Don't take off!
Come in.
Hey, Dad.
What's wrong?
It was you.
All along.
What are you talking about?
In your room.
At first, I couldn't figure out how or why it'd gotten out of my safe.

This is the story of Orson Welles' last movie,
The Other Side of the Wind.
[man 1] Uh, this is May 11th, 1971, The Other Side of the Wind.
Orson Welles. Um...
-Sound roll number eight. -[man 2] Rolling.
[man 3] 'Cause you always start announcing it before I roll. All right, now,
I'll announce it.
-Scene 58, take one. -[clapboard snaps]
[Cumming] What you're about to watch is made up of fragments of the materials that Orson and others left behind.
that Orson and others left behind.
Many of Orson's films started with a death...
and so does ours.
When Orson Welles died yesterday, he was, as he had been most of his life,
in the midst of several film projects.
[reporter 1] It was the end of a career that had once promised so much.
[reporter 2] He was a giant of a man who made Citizen Kane,
who once scared America half to death with his War of the Worlds.
[reporter 3] He'd been called a genius almost from birth.
He was reading at two, performing Shakespeare at ten.
Regrettably, his later years never matched the promise of his early years.
[reporter 3] He drifted off to lesser work and grew enormously fat.
[reporter 4] Movies were never finished.
There was this one, The Other Side of the Wind,
about a world-famous filmmaker.
Perhaps Welles' vision of himself.
[Cumming] How we sum up a person's life and the truth of that life
are rarely he same thing.
Almost any story is almost certainly some kind of lie.
But not this time.
[Cumming] This time, the story of The Other Side of the Wind
is being told by the people who were there:
cast and crew, friends and family.
-My God, you're shooting from over there? -Why not?
[man] Orson said, "They'll love me when I'm dead."
[woman] No, Orson denied ever saying that.
-[man] It's almost true. -[woman] It's not true.
Our movie starts long before things went wrong.
And they did go horribly wrong.
But it begins at a moment of promise for Orson.
Let's watch.
[host] Mr. Orson Welles.
[man 1] Every time you'd mention his name,
people would say, "What did he do since Citizen Kane?"
[man 2] Citizen Kane, the greatest motion picture ever made.
[man 1] He made such a great movie and then...
"Whatever happened to Orson Welles?"
Every list of great films, many of them lead with Citizen Kane
and say it's the finest film made.
Um... -Do you agree? -No, certainly not.
-That's interesting. -My next one is though, that's the...
-The Magnificent Ambersons? -No.
-The one I'm preparing at this moment. -Oh, the next one.
That's gonna make history.
-Could you give us the title of that? -I haven't decided what it is yet.
[man] It would become a last big effort in his lifetime.
The chance to say, "This is my masterpiece."
What will really be the big basic differences between this picture
and anything else you've ever done?
Because everything else I've ever done has been controlled,
every frame is controlled.
But I would like to take a whole story and make the picture
as though it were a documentary. The actors are gonna be improvising.
Have you done that kind of thing before with other--
Nobody's ever done it before, you know.
But that seems to me like shooting and shooting,
and aren't you afraid the end result won't have any control?
-I keep-- -Not a bit, no, I really am not.
[man] I can't even count the number of times I heard Orson say...
The greatest things in movies are divine accidents.
[man] "Embrace that accident."
And my definition of a film director
is "the man who presides over accidents."
[Welles] They're these divine accidents.
It's the only thing that keeps films from being dead.
Every time one would happen, boom!
Genius would come out.
[Welles] Everywhere, there are beautiful accidents.
There's a smell in the air, there's a look
that changes the whole resonance of what you expected.
Sometimes I've had those accidents.
I made a picture in which somebody reached through a window in Touch of Evil,
and found the egg...
And we made a whole scene about it, you know.
But I wanna go further.
[woman] Then on the basis of what you've said, it sounds as though
[woman] Then on the basis of what you've said, it sounds as though the whole thing is going to be a series of your "divine accidents."
-[Welles] If we're lucky. -If you're lucky.
That's right. You know, we're going to go fishing for accidents.
Which I think can be very exciting, you know? [man] Yeah, yeah.
Do you feel any kind of resentment
for what Hollywood did to you, or failed to offer you?
[man] At the time, Orson had lost his ability to finance his own work in America.
You are in some sense an exile, aren't you?
-You've been out of America a long time. -[Welles] Yes, yes.
[man 1] Orson had been in Europe for two decades.
Because he felt very betrayed by Hollywood.
I think he was permanently traumatized by Touch of Evil.
[man 2] The studio said, "God, Welles is functioning at such a level of brilliance.
We're gonna make film after film with him."
That's what you think.
[Welles] Then they saw a rough cut of it.
They were so horrified that I was fired.
And nobody's ever explained what horrified them.
[woman] After Evil, nobody would touch him.
They really wouldn't.
[man 3] The popular press had forgotten about him.
[man 1] People weren't chasing Orson down to work with him.
[Welles] I think I have to make a very successful box office picture.
I think I'm getting too old not to have made one.
-[man 4] Orson needed a comeback film... -And?
[man 4] ...and it had to be strong.
It's one thing to know what you want, it's another thing
to know how to go through the door when it opens.
[man 1] Hollywood was changing in the '70s, changing huge.
[man 2] The new Hollywood began around '66.
[man 3] Bonnie and Clyde, Five Easy Pieces. [man 1] Easy Rider.
[man 4] The kids with beards were taking over.
We are children playing games, when we create.
Which is what movies are to me, and what drama is to me, it's a game.
[man 3] Thirty-five-year-old men had taken over show business.
The studios didn't know anymore what was making money.
The studios were collapsing.
[man 2] When Warner Brothers stopped making cartoons, it was over.
-[gunshot] -♪ Cheree, Cheree ♪ [man 1] In the new Hollywood,
everybody had this incredible reverence for Orson Welles. ♪ Oh, baby ♪
[man 2] He was somewhere between Zen master and God.
♪ Oh, baby ♪ [man 1] I mean, sure, Citizen Kane was maybe the greatest film ever made,
but I'm not even sure it's his best film.
-[man 2] Lady From Shanghai. -[man 3] The mirror sequence.
-[man 4] Oh, wow! -[woman] Wow!
[man 5] How could you even think to do that?
[man 6] He was a prototypical independent filmmaker.
[man 2] Oh, my God, yes.
Chimes is the most perfect film ever made.
The chance to make my films in America's...
has been very hard, but I think it's getting easier.
Pictures are becoming more adventurous.
The opportunities ahead of me are greater, much than they were five years ago.
[man 2] Orson wanted in because he wanted to do a film about Hollywood.
[Cumming] It was the siren's call that drew Orson back to Hollywood.
And this is where the story really begins.
In a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel on the 4th of July, 1970.
[man] One day in 1970, near the 4th of July,
I was at Schwab's Drugstore in Hollywood.
[Cumming] This is cameraman Gary Graver.
He shot everything Orson directed for the last 15 years of his life.
[woman] Tell us how you met Orson Welles.
[Graver] I read in Variety that Orson Welles was at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
I went back to the phone booth, called him up...
...and to my surprise, he answered the phone.
-"Hello?" I said, "Oh, Orson Welles?" -Hello?
I said, "I'm Gary Graver, I'm an American cameraman."
-[Welles] Come and talk to me. -"I've got to talk to you."
I want to talk to you now!
And he said, "Get over to the Beverly Hills Hotel right away."
Wow!
I raced over to the Beverly Hills Hotel, knocked on the door, and there was Orson.
-I said, "I'd like to work with you." -Why?
Orson said, "We'll make some tests, and if I like what you do,
we'll start a script."
And I was very nervous about it.
[Welles] Cut. Go back again. Stop it! Gary, you must listen to me.
[Graver] The tests, as you see here, are shots of Orson
sitting in the Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow that he rented,
and I was shooting him.
He said, "You're the second cameraman that's called me up.
The first one was Gregg Toland on Citizen Kane."
He says, "Now you.
So, it must mean good luck.
I would like to work with you."
And we began to make a movie called: [voices overlapping] The Other Side of the Wind.
The Other Side of the Wind. What is that?
You could drive yourself nuts trying to get an answer to that one.
[Cumming] The conceit of this movie is that it is actually two movies in one.
[Welles] The Other Side of the Wind is divided into two sections.
There is the film which is made by documentary cameramen,
which is the story of the last day of the director's life.
And there is the film which is made by the director,
which has just broken down for lack of funds.
[woman] And these two stories almost simultaneously move together.
[in French] So, what is this film about?
-It's the story of an old director. -Yeah?
A generation even older than me. It's difficult to imagine that.
[man 1] The Other Side of the Wind is a movie about an aging film director.
[woman] The darling of Hollywood who fell out of favor.
[man 2] The great American film artist...
[man 3] That gets rejected in Hollywood, goes to Europe...
[woman 2] And comes back to Hollywood.
It was a thinly-veiled version of himself.
Okay. Would that make him an autobiographical character for you?
No. Everybody will think it's autobiographical, but it's not.
Yeah. Bullshit.
-[man 2] Of course it is. -[man 3] It must be autobiographical.
[man 1] A hundred percent Orson.
[man 4] No doubt it's an autobiographical movie.
[man 1] He hated that.
He didn't want to be analyzed through his films.
[man 1] Actually, The Other Side of the Wind started
because of a conversation I had with Orson.
Who is this man?
[man] Peter Bogdanovich started as a film historian.
And Orson, he was my hero.
He said, "Isn't it a pity you can't do a nice little book about me?" [chuckles]
I said, "I'd be happy to do an interview book with you."
He said, "Fine, let's do it."
And he said...
[Welles] You know why I was sleepless last night?
[Bogdanovich] Why?
[Welles] I've got a story that I've worked on for many years.
[Bogdanovich] I said, "What's that?" "Well, it's about an older film director
and a young film director, and the betrayal
of their friendship."
Not that it matters.
[Welles] I am crazy enough to do that in preference to anything else.
-[Bogdanovich] Oughta make it right away. -[Welles] Right away.
[Bogdanovich] "I must make it now."
-[Welles] Cut. -[laughter]
[Bogdanovich] He calls me up and he says, "What are you doing Thursday?"
And I said, "I'm going to Texas to start my first film."
But this was before all that.
Orson said, "What time is your plane?"
[chuckles] I said, "Three o'clock."
He said, "Can you meet me at noon where the planes fly low over the street?"
I said, "Yeah, okay. What are we doing?"
"I'll tell you about it when I see you. Just meet me at noon."
-[man] Take one, second-- -[Welles] Let me announce it.
Bus Studio, Scene 55, Take one!
The mic all right?
[Bogdanovich] At first, he had me playing a cineaste,
you know, a guy who writes about movies.
Mr. Hannaford? Uh, Mr. Hannaford.
[Bogdanovich] Jake Hannaford's the leading character, an old director.
Mr. Hannaford, uh, in the body of your film work,
how significantly would you relate the trauma of your father's suicide?
[Bogdanovich] Orson had me do it like Jerry Lewis. And it was like,
"Mr. Hannaford, do you think that the cinema is like a phallus?"
Orson thought that was hilarious.
I did some stuff like Jerry and broke myself up. [laughing]
He said, "Don't laugh!"
He wanted a free train.
[Welles] All right, come back! Come back!
Sun got in the lens.
Mr. Hannaford!
Mr. Hannaford?
[Welles] It's a crazy picture.
It's not a work of fiction, it's a little of everything.
You either hate it or loathe it, like most people.
It's kind of a departure in moviemaking.
The Other Side of the Wind is structured around a party
being thrown for the director, Jake Hannaford.
This gives him a chance to assert his relevance
amongst the biggest names of the new Hollywood movement.
Orson began shooting fragments of this scene,
and would continue to do so for the next five years.
[Welles] Chabrol, take one!
[man] During the party scenes, Orson wanted to have actual filmmakers...
Thanks.
-[man] ...on camera. -[clapboard snaps]
-But then... -[Welles] For Henry and Paul!
-Roll five, take one. -[laughing]
He wanted a fight of two young directors.
-Don't condescend-- Don't patronize me. -Let me finish. Well, let me finish.
-If you're really an honest man-- -Can I talk to him?
-Yeah, but if you're an honest man-- -May I speak with him or not?
[man] Uh, Dennis Hopper showed up.
[Welles] Dennis Hopper, filmmaker, extraordinary leading actor.
-[man] He got incredibly stoned... -[laughter]
...and was debating Jake Hannaford.
-Jake, everybody knows about you. -Yeah, I know.
[Cumming] With the lead role of Jake Hannaford not yet cast,
Welles played the role of the director off camera.
[Welles] Do you believe movies are also magic?
-[men chuckling] -Right.
When Elvis Presley was 21, he came to me and said...
he's gotta do this fight scene. He says, "I've never hit a woman before.
Gotta hit Debra Paget."
And I said, "But you don't really hit people in movies."
He says, "I suppose you're gonna say they don't really shoot real bullets at people.
I've seen the wood splinter off the wall."
-[Welles] He said that? -Yeah.
[Welles] Yeah, but aren't you confusing reality with magic?
In other words, I believe people will believe anything in movies.
[Welles] Reality is always poor, weak stuff compared to magic.
[man] Orson was a big believer in magic.
The idea that maybe... maybe what you see isn't real. [chuckles]
You may have wondered why I look so peculiar on the television.
And it's partly, I must confess to you,
the fact that you see my nose as it is.
[woman] He's really a very handsome man.
He always hides it with different noses.  He doesn't like it,
he thinks it's too weak-looking or something. I love his nose.
[interviewer] He changes noses? Oh.
In most of the films that I appear in, I put on a false nose,
usually as large as I can find.
[man] He said, "All my life, I've hidden behind masks."
And he had created a wall with these masks,
hiding the real Orson.
[Welles] The Other Side of the Wind is entirely masked.
In other words,
the party shot by a documentary crew
is in a style that wouldn't have been my style as a movie director.
And the movie within a movie is an impersonation by me
of my director character trying to make an art movie.
[Welles in French] It's not my film.
-It's a film by the character. -Yes!
[Welles in English] You will see the movie within a movie is not a movie I would ever have made.
There was no plot.
Essentially it was about my character chasing a girl,
chasing her around or something.
A little game of "catch me if you can."
It was pretty clear the film that Hannaford's making
is Orson's attempt to satirize European atmospheric cinema.
[man] Which was popular back in the '60s.
[Welles in French] And it was very amusing to make,
because I had the freedom, the joy,
to make a film that is not a film by Orson Welles.
Yes.
Because it's a film made with a mask.
[man 1] With this film,
Mr. Welles is a professional who's become an amateur.
And it worked.
[man 2] Pretty much everything he was doing was to save money.
[man 3] Because Orson paid for the shoot himself.
[man 2] Gary Graver provided him with a small, proper crew.
[Welles] Oh, boy!
[man 4] By the way, Frank Marshall, producer of Indiana Jones,
-wasn't he part of the crew? -[man 2] Yeah.
It was before I understood what a producer did. [chuckles]
[man 5] There's a glorious sense of freedom and innocence
that Welles was always yearning for.
Because they were making things up as they went along.
[man 4] We have an entire crew who would let him do anything.
The only one who didn't give him any flak was Oja.
[Welles] Her name...
is Oja. Oja Kodar.
[Cumming] The star and the co-writer
of the movie within the movie was a young Croatian artist, Oja Kodar.
She was also Orson's lover.
[man 1] Orson just loved Oja, it was the love of his life.
[man 2] And he considered her an artistic collaborator.
[in Croatian] When we first met...
I was very young...
[Oja in English] To me, he looked somehow menacing.
[older Oja] With his cape...
he was a personification of the wind itself.
But I knew the other side of this wind.
Because Orson was the wind that was capable of caressing you,
lifting you, making you dance.
[Welles] Time for a confession.
-[man] Um... he was also married. -Good night, Oja.
[woman] Olga... I call her Olga.
That's her real name, you know?
My father was fascinated by this double life.
It became intriguing and it was not boring,
this unbelievable double life.
Why my mother stayed married, I'll never know.
But... that's her choice.
[Welles] We'll leave Miss Kodar aside, for the moment.
[man 1] Orson had been shooting this material for years
with his own money, in the hopes that he could raise more money
to finish when people saw what he was shooting.
But I don't think he tried to get funding from the studios at first.
[Cumming] In fact, Orson was sneaking into abandoned studio backlots
under assumed names and filming an elaborate critique
of Hollywood itself.
Was it vengeance?
[woman 1] The Magnificent Ambersons was the beginning of what we can call... the period of betrayal.
of what we can call... the period of betrayal.
[woman 2] My father was betrayed by a lot of people.
Did he bring that on himself? Who knows?
Maybe.
[Oja] Whilst editing The Magnificent Ambersons,
Orson was practically ordered by the US government
to go to Brazil to make a documentary.
[Welles] And so I arranged to film
a voodoo witch doctor.
And I came back to the office and found that, on my desk,
in a script of the film...
was a long, steel needle.
This was the mark of the voodoo.
While I was in South America,
the studio previewed Ambersons
and said it was too down-beat.
-[muted wailing] -And they started cutting it.
[man] The editor used to send him telegrams saying,
"Come back from Brazil.
They are re-shooting The Ambersons. We are all under contract.
We can do nothing against that. You are the only one who can stop that.
Come back."
And he didn't.
[Welles] I was fired by the studio.
I never recovered from that attack.
They destroyed Ambersons
and destroyed me.
I didn't get a job as a director for years afterwards.
[man] He was considered somebody who didn't care that much
about the commerciality of a project
by many in Hollywood.
Therefore, Orson needed to get financing from untraditional sources.
And, eventually, it worked.
[woman 1] But, regarding the money, it's complicated.
When I was there, it was a Spanish producer...
-[man 2] Andrés Gómez. -[man 1] Right, Andrés Gómez.
I was not a financier of the film, but I did find some money.
[man 3] We had some money from Gómez, but we needed more.
[man 2] So, Orson found French producer Dominique Antoine.
[Antoine] Yeah, so I had the money at that time
because I had made an association with the brother-in-law of the Shah.
[man 1] The Shah of Iran.
[man 2] And he had a dictatorship.
[Antoine] The brother-in-law and I created together
a company called Les Films de L' Astrophore.
[man 3] L' Astrophore.
The Iranian company that was Paris-based.
[Antoine] So, I said to Orson, "The Other Side of the Wind, of course we do it."
[man] I believe she came with a satchel full of money.
[Antoine] Orson was like the Cat of Cheshire.
With a smile from one ear to the other one. And he was purring.
-[Oja] Money makes miracles. -[Welles] Yeah.
-[bird screeching] -[Welles] Yeah.
You're a bad boy, and you know it.
Confused?
Don't worry about it. It's not the most important thing.
What is important
is that Orson finally had the money for his comeback film.
What he didn't have was a leading man.
[Bogdanovich] I remember one time we were in Paris,
and he'd already shot a lot of footage without the leading character.
[interviewer] Would you play the director?
[Welles] Who should play it is John Huston.
Huston is the best, and I'm the second best.
If I can't get Huston, there's nobody else but me.
[Bogdanovich] And he's sort of pacing up and down the street, saying,
"But why should I give it to Huston? It's a great part, I should play it myself."
[Welles] If I should ever...
get close enough to the pearly gates to have an argument
with the man who opens them,
I would suggest that the reason to let me into heaven
is that I didn't play that wonderful part.
[Welles] And gave it instead to John Huston.
It's a piece of unselfishness which I have regretted ever since.
[Oja] John Huston was the sexiest old devil I ever met.
I'm trying to live...
live life as best as I possibly can.
[Antoine] Why'd he want John Huston?
They loved each other, they were brothers!
[man] The thing about Orson Welles and my dad is that they were really
able to live up to their own mythology
and camp that up a little bit.
It is a lot of smoke and mirrors. You don't know what's real and what's not.
And that's what they're playing with.
They'd known each other for so many years, and they were both rapscallions.
John loved Orson Welles.
And he received a call one morning,
and he said, "Oh, my God!" And I said, "What?" He said, "It's Orson.
He wants me to come to Carefree, Arizona."
[man 1] Gary called me at about 10:00 at night.
"Mike, can you be in Arizona tomorrow?"
[man 2] "Orson's putting together a ten-day shoot."
[man 3] Would I come down for ten days. He needed me.
[man 4] To go to the desert in the middle of nowhere.
[man 2] "It's gonna be like summer camp, I don't know if there's any money.
-Are you interested?" -And I said, "Yes."
-"Yeah. That sounds like fun." -Absolutely.
I'm in my car driving to Arizona.
I suddenly looked up and there was the Zabriskie Point house.
[man 1] It's clearly no coincidence
that the location that Orson chose to shoot in Arizona
is in fact the house next door
to the house Antonioni blew up in Zabriskie Point.
[Bogdanovich] On The Other Side of the Wind, Orson wanted to push further than Antonioni.
[man 1] Orson was the ultimate independent filmmaker.
I was part of a core crew, not of 80,
but of six people plus Orson.
[Antoine] He wanted to be in a kind of circus.
Full of young people.
I fell right in the vat of cream.
You know, I fell right in the middle of it.
For me to have the luck to work with Orson Welles,
oh, it was so exciting, even when it was difficult.
[man] I mean, the first day of shooting, he fired the sound man.
Can you please just slow down? Otherwise I'm going to fall off the car.
[woman] Everybody's job was really difficult.
[man 1] I had built sets, schlep sets, hung lights.
[woman] This young kid, so anxious to get this thing for Orson
-that he ran through the plate glass. -[man 1] Shattered it.
Fortunately, I was going so fast...
[man 1] He was in the living room before the pieces of glass
had finished cascading down to the floor.
-[man 2] Oh, it's great. -[woman] It was crazy.
[man 1] It is insane,
but it's the kind of thing that happens to people who are working like Orson.
I picked John Huston up at the airport in Phoenix.
[man 3] I said, "Mr. Huston, I'm thrilled you're here."
I said, "We've been waiting for you for three years to be in this film.
We've been shooting around you." And Huston looked really alarmed. He said,
"You've been acting in this picture for three years?"
Write that down, somebody.
[Welles] Cut.
-I fucked that up. -[Welles] Let’s do it once again.
The little campier still, but masculine.
Once again.
[man 3] The Other Side of the Wind is not a complete departure for Orson.
[man 1] And it reflected
the process that Orson had been going through in Europe in making his own films.
[Cumming] Welles' exile had meant that he was exiled from the facilities of Hollywood.
[Welles] I have a different style as a director,
because I know of things I can't ask for.
[man 1] For example, with Othello,
there's a fight scene where a punch is thrown,
but then production had to shut down
while Orson went off to make more money as an actor.
And the reaction shot of the guy getting punched
was shot two years later and a thousand miles away.
It worked.
[man 2] Who would've thought that was possible?
Good evening.
Now...
the first thing you're probably asking yourself is, "What is Orson Welles
doing as the host of a comedy show?"
[man] I met Orson on Kopykats, a show we did with a bunch of impersonators.
[announcer] Starring Rich Little.
[Little] I was in the studio doing a routine
called "Famous Celebrity Sneezing."
I said, "Orson Welles, sneezing."
I did not know that he'd just come into the studio. I went...
[deep, dramatic voice] "Aah-aah-choo."
And he put his arm on my shoulder and said...
"I never sneeze."
We clicked.
Well, gee, Orson, I don't know how this show could afford you.
[Little] He phoned me at home, and told me about this movie, Other Side of the Wind,
and would I be interested in playing a wide-eyed, young director.
I said, "Well, great.
Just on one condition. That I have to shoot my scenes in about three weeks."
He said, "Oh, no, no. I'll probably need you for about a week."
When I was introduced to John Huston,
Orson went up to him and said, "John, this is Rich Little.
He's one of the world's greatest impressionists."
And John Huston said:
[imitates Huston] "Oh, well, then we're gonna get along fine, because I'm into art, you know."
because I'm into art, you know."
[imitates Welles] "No, no, not that kind of impressionist.
He does voices."
[imitates Huston] "Why would he do that? Why couldn't they get the real people?"
[Cumming] Orson populated the film with characters based on the icons of the film community.
Like screenwriter John Milius.
Film critic Pauline Kael.
I just want to know what he represents.
[Cumming] And the head of Paramount Pictures, Robert Evans.
I started to figure out that Rich Little's supposed to be Peter.
The character was a young, successful director who did imitations.
And that's what Peter did.
I'm Peter Bogdanovich.
What's the word I say? Oh, action!
And so then I started to think, "Well, is John Huston supposed to be Orson?"
I remember thinking, “Oh, my gosh, this is starting to get really weird.”
I can remember one time we shot a scene...
Brooksie.
-Right here by your side, skipper. -You know what I'd like for my birthday?
[Welles] Cut.
John couldn't drive.
And he never told us this.
-My camera's gone out. -Oh, Jesus!
-[man 1] Certainly, it was a stick-shift. -Give me the magazine, quick!
[man 1] And I was kinda worried, 'cause I had to return the car.
-It's stopped. -The magazine jammed.
The car stopped, too.
-Let's put it in drive. In "D." -[gears grinding]
[Little] It looked like we were gonna go right into the lake.
John said to me,
"Oh, Rich, you'll get good billing."
'Orson Welles, John Huston, and Rich Little,
all drowned'."
This is a picture about the love of death.
You came to my party after all.
Get in. I'll drive you.
[Bogdanovich] This is Jake Hannaford's 70th birthday party.
He died at the end of it.
[man 1] And there was some question as to whether it was an accident or suicide.
[Bogdanovich] So, what you're seeing is a reconstruction of the...
-Roll tape! -40, David, take six.
[Bogdanovich] ...made up of all this different footage, all put together.
-Mr. Hannaford. -Happy birthday, Jake!
[man] The whole documentary, the kind that we're all so accustomed to today,
he was inventing.
[onlookers shout] Happy birthday!
[man 2] And for that, Gary was probably an ideal cameraman,
because Gary was very fast.
[man 3] Gary Graver was the key person on the film.
He was the closest person to Orson.
[man 1] Gary was really like the son Orson didn't have.
Orson and Gary, father-son...
No. Not so much.
-Orson isn't very paternal. -[Welles] Action.
Go back! Go back, back up, back up. Quickly!
-Up! Up! Up! -[woman] Bossy, yes.
Paternal, no.
[Welles] Slower! Stop!
Move slowly!
[man] My father Gary's enthusiasm for filmmaking
was something I don't think I've ever seen equaled.
Every moment that my dad was not actively engaged in shooting,
he looked at that as time lost.
[woman] Gary and I, we got married when I was 21.
And if he was scheduled to be home at 10:00,
and it went until 4:00 in the morning, oh, well, he stayed.
[Welles] Action!
[Bogdanovich] Gary did as he was told.
Orson put the camera where he wanted to,
and Gary was, you know, just his slave.
[man] Orson would have the camera to his eye and he'd say, "Come here, Gary."
And then he'd move his head to the side, and he said, "This is it, see it?"
And I had to make it exactly right.
[man 1] When I look back on it, it's so complicated.
You wanted to please him,
because you knew he was such an artist.
[man 2] I mean, anything was possible with Orson.
[man 1] Everything had to happen right away,
even when we didn't quite understand what we were doing.
There was no script.
[woman] He was constantly writing it as he was going along.
And fiddy-owney-owney-own!
[man] Sometimes I had trouble understanding some of the lines.
What?
I remember one line was the great "anonymous gang-shag."
"And the cool, dim, anonymous gang-shag."
Would somebody please tell me why I'm going to a stupid party
with all these stupid dummies?
[man] I had no idea what all these dummies were.
[man 2] There were dummies out by the pool.
They were there 'cause Orson said, "Let's put these dummies out there."
But it was like, "Well, why?"
[man 3] Didn't make any sense to me.
[man 4] But Orson knew exactly what he wanted.
Every part of it was here.
To Baker, one.
[Little] We were doing a scene and Orson said...
[Welles] Now a midget goes from behind you...
All of you feel midgets touching your feet.
[Little] "Midgets running between your legs."
-All right. -Keep acting?
It’s what you do to make this work, right?
[Little] Orson said, "Everybody look up! Midgets on the roof!"
I said, "Orson, what the heck is this midgets bit?"
And he said, "We're going to put the midgets in later, in Spain."
And then walked away.
The rule of thumb was Orson knows what he's doing,
don't question anything. Just do it.
I'm not sure he knew where this movie was going, and, um...
I'm not sure anybody did, actually. [chuckles]
[man 1] It's quite clear that Rich wasn't comfortable with Orson's process.
Wasn't a team player.
[man 2] Realistically, I suppose he was counting down the days
until he knew he had to leave.
[Little] My three weeks was up, and I had to leave,
because I had club engagements that I can't get out of.
And if I don't show up I'm gonna be sued.
And I thought to myself, "Oh, my gosh,
I'm not gonna be able to finish this part."
[man 3] Well, here's what I remember happened.
It was the last night.
[man 4] The film was practically finished.
[man 3] We were supposed to shoot this big scene.
We went to get him, Saturday morning, he was gone.
[woman] We were all there waiting for him, and he never showed up.
[man 3] As I recall, he wanted to go to New Orleans for something.
[woman] He had an engagement in Las Vegas.
[man 1] Allegedly, Orson's secretary had been having a relationship with Rich Little.
[man 3] He missed his wife and he was tired of working.
Orson said, "No! You're on a contract here for the next..." And he left and went.
You don't do that to Orson.
[man 2] He felt betrayed.
[Little] I could've come back later and finished the scenes.
We never discussed that, and I-- That always puzzled me.
I thought, "They're gonna have to do all those scenes over again.
Oh, my gosh! I can't imagine."
[man 4] It was crazy.
I have replaced actors on the second week of shooting.
But after seven weeks...
it's impossible.
[Bogdanovich] I called him, I said, "How's it going?"
"Terrible.
I just blew 25 Gs and I don't have that kind of bread.
I had to pay off Rich Little."
-"Why?" -"He can't act!"
"Oh, gee, I'm sorry to hear that. What are you gonna do?"
"I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just can't use any of his stuff."
He is a rough magician, isn't he?
[Bogdanovich] So I said, "That's terrible, Orson. Why don't I play it?"
He is a rough magician, isn't he?
And then he said, "Well, you're playing that other part."
I said, "You can just cut me out of that."
All right, men! Let's get organized. Now where shall we start?
[man 1] John Huston goes, "Peter, how many movies have you actually acted in now?"
"Well, this is my second, Mr. Huston." "Two? Makes it easy to count!" [chortles]
[Welles] Scene three X, take one.
-Ah, red light. -[low murmurs]
-No, we-- -Mr. Hannaford.
Oh, shit, I'm sorry. I'll do that again.
-Start again? -[Welles] Yeah, do it better.
-You must deal with every situation. -Okay.
Why snap your finger? We're not cutting. Uh-uh.
Orson said, "Play it like it's us."
[Cumming] In case you haven't noticed,
Peter Bogdanovich went from playing exactly who he was in 1970,
a young writer,
to exactly who he became in 1974: a celebrated movie director.
My book on Hannaford's been canceled. Indefinitely.
Yeah, the first five chapters took the two of us three and a half years.
Finally, I just had to start directing myself so I could eat.
-[Welles] Ha! Good. Now right away-- -Do another one. Right.
-Action? -[Welles] Action.
I had to start directing myself so I could eat!
-[Welles] Cut! Very good. -That was good.
[Bogdanovich] At that time, Orson had more influence on me than anybody.
[host] There's a number of myths about you already,
even though you're young. Like the fact that you had a goal set for yourself
that you would make a movie at the same age Orson Welles did.
Oh, I wanted-- I thought I'd be a failure if I didn't make a movie
at least by the time I was 25, which is when Orson made
Citizen Kane, and I was a disaster 'cause I didn't make one until I was 27.
[Bogdanovich] My films aren't like his films, but he inspired me.
[man 2] Their relationship started as mentor/mentee.
[man 1] But Peter was at the top of an arc of a meteoric rise.
[interviewer] You're as successful as you are
and you have a gorgeous lady, as you do have.
Cybill, uh...
Yes, let's not discuss what-- Yes, go ahead.
You have her, you have four pictures in a row that make 30 million dollars.
A guy has to learn to hate you.
[man] Bogdanovich had outpaced his mentor.
♪ No matter what the future brings... ♪
[man 2] Orson realized, "He has money, I don't.
I'm Orson Welles, he's not.
-What's wrong? -The future.
What's the matter with it?
We cannot all be masters.
Nor all masters cannot be truly followed.
[Bogdanovich] I remember, we were sitting at lunch one day,
and on top of the refrigerator was this
industrial size bag of Fritos.
Orson tore the top of it off, poured most of the contents onto the kitchen table,
sat down, took a big bunch of Fritos, put it in his mouth.
So, of course, I did the same thing.
Absolutely out of the blue, Orson just turned to me and said,
"If anything happens to me, I want you to promise me you'll finish the picture."
I said, "Oh Jesus, Orson, why do you say a thing like that?
Nothing’s gonna happen to you. Why do you say..."
"I know, nothing's gonna happen."
[young Bogdanovich] Hey, why pick on me?
I mean, the man is infested with disciples. I'm the apostle, lady.
The film deals with the betrayal of friendship.
Movies and friendship.
Those are mysteries.
He tested people with that.
[man] Betrayal can only come if there's an initial love present.
-You two are very close, aren't you? -Yes, I'd like to ask you about that.
[man] Orson created an environment where others would get sucked into it.
It was all within Orson's control.
And he was creating an inevitability.
She's gonna say I stole everything from you, skipper,
I'm never gonna walk away from that.
Well, it's all right to borrow from each other.
What we must never do is borrow from ourselves.
[man] We winked and nodded at each other,
which was like, my God, this is going to happen.
This inevitability is going to occur.
'Course you're close, you two. You have to be.
You have no choice.
[Cumming] Orson had gone to the looking glass and passed beyond it.
The story was now being re-written in real time.
[man] There was a scene in which Hannaford comes into the party
with a blond teenager on his arm.
[man 2] She was pretty young.
[man 3] What was her name, Mavis Henshaw?
-What's your name, sweetie? -Mavis Henscher.
[man 4] Actually, she was this little waitress we found at a breakfast place.
[Mavis] Want me to bring you another scotch?
And we just went... “That's Mavis.” [laughs]
She didn't know who Orson Welles was. She didn't know who John Huston was.
And there were times when their combined energies
could barely get a performance out of her.
-[Huston] Ready? -[Welles] Thank you. Action.
Action!
Oh, I thought he was gonna say his part first.
-[Welles] You say it. -All right.
Say it.
Gee, I don't know, I have school tomo-- No, wait.
[Bogdanovich]  Absolutely dreadful actress.
[man 2] But why would Orson wanna do that to himself?
[man 3] She's kind of a Cybill Shepherd take-off.
[man 2] Was she?
Oh, okay.
[man 1] Clearly Orson was giving Peter a hard time about his relationship
with Cybill Shepherd after Last Picture Show.
Cybill was 19, I think, when Peter discovered her.
With Orson, you never quite know what is gonna happen.
[man] Peter said, "Orson's making fun of me
and things I've said to Cybill."
-[Huston] Tomorrow's Sunday, Mavis. -Pardon?
[Huston] You'll be flying down with us to Mexico.
Gee, I don't know, I have school on Monday.
I'll, uh, write a note to your teacher.
[woman] I was supposedly, like, his girlfriend
and I was really young, and he was very old.
He's like, "Mavis! Mavis! Come here!" [chuckles]
It was... It was very strange.
Mother seems to think a little young blood would be good for us.
-You could be right at that. -Well, she's always right.
Excuse me, fellas, I think we have a confrontation.
-[Welles] Once again. John? -Yeah.
You took a look back at the girl after "She's always right."
Excuse me, fellas, I think we have ourselves a confrontation.
[man] In this story, Hannaford takes away this blond girl from Peter's character
[man] In this story, Hannaford takes away this blond girl from Peter's character who’s kind of a crude, sexual power play.
We like your little friend.
[Welles] "We like your little friend."
She's mine.
-[Welles] Cut. -Again. [Welles] Again.
[woman] He thrived on friction.
So, the old man can still score.
How he scores and who he scores with,
now that, my friend, gets us into some very interesting country.
[man 1] I think Orson was fascinated by this macho thing.
It's part of where the concept of The Other Side of the Wind
was even born.
[Welles] The whole mystique of the, uh...
the he-man.
This picture we're gonna make is against he-men.
[man 1] The initial conception of The Other Side of the Wind, that it was gonna be a little bit of a satire of an obsessively
that it was gonna be a little bit of a satire of an obsessively
masculine character, like Hemingway.
[man 2] So, it's no coincidence this film takes place July 2nd,
the date of Hemingway's death.
Hemingway? That, uh, left hook of his was overrated.
[man 1] And the character displayed certain
tendencies of, perhaps, latent homosexuality.
He wants to fuck him.  He wants to fuck his leading man. Don't you see that?
Don't you see that there in his movies? And he can't acknowledge that.
[man 1] Orson was very comfortable with himself and his feminine side.
[man 2] But he could fall right into a guy-guy role.
[man 1] I think Orson was always kind of interested in that duality in men.
[interviewer] You've had so much written about you,
and you were so far ahead of your time in achievement.
Has your success made you less willing to challenge than you were in those times?
Oh, I think not at all. I think I'm much more of a...
of a renegade than I was then.
-[interviewer] In what way? -[Welles] Oh, in about every way.
[man] The best scene I've seen in The Other Side of the Wind
is the sex scene in the car, from the film within the film...
which is seven minutes long in the version Welles edited.
[man] Yes, it's long, long.
[Oja] Everybody talks about the sexy car scene.
I remember it having quite an impression on me. [clears throat]
I remember being in my mid-teens,
and having the screening of this footage.
The footage of Oja was remarkably erotic.
Of her in a car
uh, with a hose being poured over the car, creating all these droplets and the...
the windshield wipers going.
[man 1] The car never moved, and they had a couple of guys with hoses.
[man 2] Hundreds of feet of garden hoses.
We robbed water from all of his neighbors.
[man 3] I did all the little things on set.
And Orson yelled down to me, "Hey kid, pick up that hose and make rain."
[scoffs] What?
[Oja] One of our paraplegic friends was pushed down the road,
holding two lights in his hands, impersonating car in a motion.
[man 4] The movie inside the movie, it's about love, about sex, about desire.
It's incredibly hot.
[man 2] And it's unlike anything he'd ever done.
His earlier films were rather prudish in their treatment of sexuality.
[Bogdanovich] He was, he called himself prudish.
And he didn't think films needed nudity.
Come, Desdemona.
I have but an hour of love to spend with thee.
[man 1] Orson felt that explicit sexuality was distracting from the art in the narrative.
[Bogdanovich] He said, "It just shows a lack of imagination."
[Oja] He never talked about sex.
[Bogdanovich] That's why Oja such a shock.
[Oja] I think the things I contributed to his creativity was the eroticism.
I introduced the sex.
I ask Orson, "How do you want me to do this?"
"Well," he said, "any way you feel like it. It's your story."
So, I thought what kind of female I should be.
So, I decided to be a praying mantis.
Wow, my word!
[man 1] She sat on his lap and made love to him
while her character's boyfriend was driving the car.
Her chain beating against her breasts.
[man 4] He ask Oja, “Give animal look.”
[man 3] I still remember the fantastic color,
the rhythm, the pulsing rhythm. It’s like a cinematic equivalent of an orgasm.
But he shot that over, like, a three-year period.
He shot part of it in his driveway in Los Angeles, and then
he shot more of it in his backyard in France.
[man 4] At one moment, it's Gary Graver with false hair,
playing the young guy.
The film is an exploration of Orson's desire.
The writer Peter Bartel
described The Other Side of the Wind as
"a desperate venture shared by desperate men."
As production lagged on, the financiers and the crew
became restless.
Gary would be pleading with Orson, "I gotta eat."
[woman] Once in a while, Gary would actually have to work to make money.
[man 1] Gary would take other jobs in B movies,
just so that he could afford to work for Orson.
[man 2] He's the only guy I know who worked with Orson Welles and Ed Wood.
Gary shot this film, One Million AC/DC.
It was the world's first bisexual dinosaur movie.
-What's that? -[creature roaring]
Don't worry, it can't eat us in here.
[man 2] It’s not what Gary wanted to have as his trademark in his career.
The Other Side of the Wind was the film.
This was gonna be his claim to fame. This is the one that would
take him to new heights.
Orson said, "Gary, if you get a job on another movie, you come to me.
If I need you, you can't do it."
[man 2] Ultimately, I think he found the easiest path towards making all this work
was to do adult films.
-Gary did a lot of porn. -[shouts]
[man 2] Hundred or so films that he never wanted to have his name associated with,
he worked under an assumed name.
[woman] Akdov Telmig.
That's "vodka gimlet" spelled backwards.
[man 1] He was shooting these semi-porn movies and he asked me if I wanted to be a part of this one called 3 A.M.
and he asked me if I wanted to be a part of this one called 3 A.M.
I think that was... it had pornographic elements to it.
And Orson knew that this was important to Gary, to get this movie done,
so he wanted to help him.
He came over and he was at Gary's house, and they cut it together.
And Orson ended up cutting the shower scene, yeah.
Yeah.
[woman] Excuse me.
-Oh! -Yeah, it's totally true.
Orson was very decisive. He was very like, "Okay, we need to cut here, we go there."
There was no pharumphing around.
It was like, "I need to get this off the docket,
so I can get Gary back to work again."
[man] Gary's work never ended.
He got worn down on it, for sure.
[man 2] I think there were two occasions
that he was hospitalized for exhaustion.
He just physically was collapsing.
-[Welles] Now, Gary. Gary? -[thudding]
-[man] You all right, Gary? -[Welles] You feel all right?
[Gary] Yeah, I'm all right.
[man] I think he might have thrown the towel in with any other director.
[man 2] And he would try. He would tell Orson,
"I can't." But somehow,
Orson would always find a way to get him to change his mind.
The costs were tremendous.
You don't go through multiple divorces unscathed.
[man 3] Orson would push you
to the point where you said, "Fuck you, fat man,
and take that legend and shove it where the sun don't shine."
And just at that moment,
where he could feel that he had gone too far,
he would wrap his arm around you and basically say,
"Have I told you what a great job you've been doing for me lately?"
[man 4] There's no doubt about it that he seemed to be doing everything he could
to alienate as many people as possible.
But why? What is all that about?
It's strange.
I fear dying before I have accomplished something
that I'm...
not ashamed of, that I'm even a little proud of. I'm afraid...
that I will be taken away before I have justified
the luck and joy that I've had.
[Welles] Relax totally.
Relax your face, sad, empty.
Empty. Now say, "Many happy returns," so I hardly hear you.
Many happy returns.
You pronounced it too carefully.
Many happy returns.
[man 2] There is a...
inconclusiveness, or a lack of definition
that is basic to this effort of Orson's.
You know, was it some sort of endless odyssey?
We'll never know.
Orson knew what he wanted. He knew.
-[man] Take 21. -[Welles] Action.
What happened to the lights?
[woman] But, unless you have a brain that works like that,
how does anyone else know?
It was this circus of scattered souls.
We were totally out of reality.
What was happening on the set
was so much like what was happening in the movie.
[man] It was like, "Wait a minute. That's Orson.
Is it? Orson, is that you?" "No, that's John Huston. It's not me."
[woman] John didn't know what Orson was doing.
He said, "I just can't figure out what the hell he's putting together."
[Welles] Come forward with your matches, looking, everybody, quickly.
[woman] But it's Orson, it'll be something.
[man] Test one, take one!
[Welles] Keep moving here.
[woman] One night in particular, I was listening to John and Orson,
and John was saying, “What the hell is this movie about, Orson?"
And Orson said, "It's about a miserable prick.
This is his swan song.
It's about us."
[man] My father felt that film was a sort of slightly vulgar art-form.
He made one for them and one for himself,
and was able to play the system,
more like a poker player.
Orson couldn't have been more different, yeah.
[woman] My father was such a perfectionist,
and movies were his canvas.
Every shot of my father's movies are a painting.
[man] And Orson's line was that Huston was willing to sell out.
[man 2] I kept waiting for my big scene with John Huston,
the one time he was supposed to really interact with me.
One day, we were shooting and I said,
"Where's John?" He hadn't been around for a while,
and one of the crew said, "He's off making some little film somewhere."
[man] It was a huge success.
-“Masterpiece,” they called it. -[crowd shouting]
It was wonderful for my father. A Kipling story
in the Atlas Mountains was heaven, heaven on earth.
But to think that, at that moment,
the industry is not paying the same amount of respect to Welles is sad.
[man 1] He once turned to me and he said,
"Citizen Kane is the greatest curse of my life.
Every time I do anything,
people start comparing this to where it stands vis-à-vis
what they call the greatest American movie.
This is my curse."
No other director has ever been held up to such an impossible standard.
What The Other Side of the Wind is about is, in a sense, a bookend
to Citizen Kane, about the tragic end of...
somebody who had become great...
and then had lost his place in America.
[Bogdanovich] Well, you know,
Orson said...
"No story has a happy ending,
unless you stop telling it before it's over with."
[Oja] The tragedy of The Other Side of the Wind started with Andrés Vicente Gómez.
He was our Spanish co-producer.
[man 2] I'm not sure how much I can say about this without getting into...
um... muddy legal waters.
[man 3] Yeah, I was there and I really, to this day, don't know...
Whoa... Oh, wait a minute. I do know.
Oh, this story I can't tell.
[man 1] Andrés Gómez had supposedly put up a couple of hundred thousand dollars
towards production costs on The Other Side of the Wind,
and was on the set. He left, and we were told that
he was going to pick up the next tranche of investment,
something in the order of a quarter of a million dollars.
We were running out of cash and we kept, "Where's Andrés?
Where's Andrés? When is he coming back?" Well, he never did come back.
I've heard that he vanished with some money, but I don't know if that's true.
I don't know-- He may have vanished with his own money.
[man 3] The problem is everybody got their information from Orson.
Nobody has direct evidence of how the money disappeared.
[man 4] I read that he blamed me 'cause of the finance fiasco,
which is totally untrue.
I made a settlement with him.
There was no complaint, there was no anything.
If it was true, why didn't they make any claim to me, you know?
It created chaos. I mean, suddenly we're not filming.
And then we're even blaming each other.
You can imagine what happens to morale.
And then we're just all sorta, "What's Orson gonna do?"
[man] Mark it.
Go!
[man 1] Orson certainly was having trouble getting the film finished,
and when the production had to move to Los Angeles
and needed interiors that could work to double the Arizona house,
Peter had Orson move into his house in Beverly Hills to shoot there.
[man 2] What happened is, I think Orson sort of took advantage of that.
[man 3] Peter told Orson he could stay at his house
for maybe two, three weeks a month.
Right on!
[Shepherd] Well, he stayed on and off for three years.
Right on!
[man 4] Peter and Cybill Shepherd were living in the east wing.
[Shepherd] It was a very large house.
And he ate a lot.
Ah, the French champagne...
has always been celebrated for its excellence.
-[Shepherd] Fudgsicles! -[Welles chortling]
[Shepherd] He had to have them all the time.
He got very angry if there were no Fudgsicles.
And I had strict orders never to disturb him.
And then I smell smoke one day.
He was in the downstairs guest room.
And I followed it down up to the door and tap-tap-tap,
"Orson, is everything okay?"
[mimics Welles' voice] "Yes, it's taken care of."
He'd put a lit cigar in his robe pocket.
[woman] He was miserable.
He was never as fat as he was then.
And it was because of the movie.
[man 2] Over time, Peter gave more to Orson than he ever imagined he was going to give.
[Huston] Don't give up the ship, eh, Brooksie? I'm not.
[Welles] It's really embarrassing because he's broke.
Don't think I'm not ready to--
Don't think I'm not ready to put up a fight for you.
[man 2] I think, for a long time, you could sort of justify,
"Well, Orson needs me.
I'm helping him, maybe something good will come out of it."
It's you I'm thinking of.
-God, I don't-- -[Welles] Don't touch anything.
"It's you I'm thinking of." Right into the door, that one.
It's you I'm thinking of.
[man 2] At a certain point, it was like, it should be time for Orson to...
to go, but Orson's not going, and how do I sorta...
try to tell him to do that?
We who somehow glow a little in his light...
the fireflies,
he does quite often swallow whole.
It's a fact that some of us, he chews on rather slowly.
[Welles] Cut.
[Cumming] Orson commandeered Peter's screening room and turned it into his editing suite.
There he worked all hours, piecing together
The Wind.
[Welles] This is a Moviola.
It's a machine for editing film.
[Oja] Orson decided on a completely new approach.
[man] Orson cut it.
He cut it, every take, in a lot of parts
-and he reconstruct it. -Action!
Curtain.
-Curtain. -[Welles] A film is...
never right
until it's right musically.
-[man 2] I ended up working as an editor. -[Welles] Cut!
I spent six months on what I call the bathroom orgy scene.
There were 500 edits.
And I spent six months with him editing two frames here, five frames here, six...
He kept editing it a little bit more and a little bit more.
[man] His whole concept of The Other Side of the Wind
was evolving, that's what he said. I said, "Well, how can it be evolving now?"
He said, "It's all in the editing."
I've never forgotten.
"It's all in the editing."
[Welles] The jigsaw pieces were separated by
breaks in time.
Jesus, with all your troubles, what's one lousy leading man?
There was no way for the picture to be put together, except in my mind.
Jesus, what's one lousy leading man?
[Welles] Cut!
[man 2] It was funny, 'cause, after all that,
Orson still wanted Hollywood to embrace him.
And I think he thought that the AFI
uh, Life Achievement Award was going to be that moment.
[announcer] The American Film Institute presents a salute to Orson Welles.
[man] I was the Founding Director of the AFI. I started the Life Achievement Awards.
[announcer] To salute an outstanding individual
for his lifetime contributions to the art of motion pictures.
[man] We concluded that Orson should be the next recipient,
but The Other Side of the Wind intruded.
Peter was my medium.
[Bogdanovich] Stevens called me.
[man] Peter said, "Orson would like to show something
from his new film, The Other Side of the Wind."
I said, "Fine."
It was a big deal, because we were trying to sell the movie then.
[man] He was trying to sell the film.
[woman] He thought he was going to get the money to finish it.
[man] Which was not unreasonable,
but it would grow ever more complicated
as we got nearer to the time.
[man] Nobody exceeded Orson in charm
when he turned it on and he came to play.
[man 2] This was all of Hollywood there.
What a better forum to present the movie at? I mean...
[Frank Sinatra] Now, how about a look at the future of our gifted friend?
The Other Side of the Wind.
It's about a celebration in honor of a famous movie director
who is not Orson.
And all of the movie freaks and filmmakers in the world are in at this bash
that I'm talking about, including a brilliant young director
who, by another coincidence, is not Peter Bogdanovich,
but is played by Peter Bogdanovich.
[man 2] Orson thought the AFI was that moment where everyone was going to
give him his just desserts.
This picture is beautiful.
And so are you, dear Orson.
[Welles] This honor I can only accept
in the name of all the mavericks.
And don't imagine that this
raggle taggle gypsyo is claiming to be free.
It's just that some of the necessities to which I am a slave
are different from yours.
[man] He was not sucking up to the audience.
He was basically saying, "Fuck you," to the audience,
"Why haven't you acknowledged my genius today?"
-[applause] -Let us raise our cups then,
standing as some of us do on opposite ends of the river,
and drink together
to what really matters to us all.
To our crazy and beloved profession.
To the movies, to good movies.
To every possible kind.
[man] Orson makes a great speech.
[man 2] And then he worked in a clip of his new film.
[Welles] The scene...
that you're going to see takes place in a projection room.
Waiting there is the big studio boss.
The stooge is trying to sell
the unfinished movie that Jake is making,
for which he needs end money.
I just think it was sad.
He was practically begging for money.
-What happens here? -I'm not really sure, Max.
-You-- You better ask Jake. -I'd better read the script.
There isn't one.
Jake, he’s just making it up as he goes along.
He's done it before.
[man] Nobody gave him a dime.
[man 2] He thought he was going to attract
somebody who would open up the vault and say, "Whatever you need."
And he didn't get it.
All right, go home! Who gives a shit?
You stiffs can put all this stuff together. We'll have our own movie.
A real movie!
A real movie!
Maybe she just don't love us like she used to.
Maybe.
[man 2] Orson said to me once that,
"Los Angeles is the only city where every road leads to the airport.
If you're here, Hollywood can't wait to get you out of here."
[Oja] The clouds around our film were gathering from all directions.
[Bogdanovich] The new Hollywood ended around '75.
Star Wars and Jaws were blockbusters,
not personal films, and changed the atmosphere.
[Welles] I did have the chance,
right after the tribute, of reviving my career in America.
But it was destroyed by the Iranians.
[reporter] Iran's Islamic revolution.
[reporter 2] Many foreign-owned businesses
and their assets confiscated without payment.
[man 1] Financing got into deep trouble.
The Iranian company, they simply shut off the spigot.
[Oja] You see, the Shah himself
was the brother-in-law of our producer.
[man 3] When he was overthrown by the Ayatollah...
...the film was confiscated by somebody...
Well, here it is... if anybody wants to see it.
[man 3] ...and sent to a vault in Paris.
[Welles] The Iranians attempted to move it out of Paris only two months ago.
[man 1] Orson sued to finish his film.
[Bogdanovich] Then, you know, he got fucked.
The French court locked The Other Side of the Wind in a vault.
[man 1] Orson couldn't have access to the film.
[Welles] When you hear the cry, "Death to the Shah,"
it doesn't come entirely from the Iranian people.
[man 1] Now, pretty much everything was shot
by this time.
And Orson was heartbroken.
I didn't wanna-- don't wanna be introduced,
because I don't want this to seem like a formal occasion.
-[laughter] -That stops right now.
Stops right now. Back.
About ten feet, you get a much better shot. Zoom.
[woman] Sir, my question is a little bit personal.
What are the greatest events of your life in relation to your work as a film star?
The greatest moment is always
when you know the money's in the bank.
The point is, you have fallen in love with an impossible medium,
because it's so hard to get the money for your pictures.
It's so hard to get the distribution.
I believe we should work
in the constant recognition
of the fact that we are lucky to be working,
and that our luck is too great to confuse it
with ultimate justice.
Particularly, since any intelligent person knows
that there is no justice in the world.
Of any kind.
My God, it's vodka.
This... [cackling]
That's all. Don't go on shooting me laughing and saying nothing.
Come on, I don't want... I don't want footage of myself--
[woman] Sometimes I try to imagine Orson
having different bedrooms in different hotels.
And the door to this room is locked. And under the bed
are hidden boxes and boxes of film.
Who knows?
[interviewer] A number of the things you've done, films you've made,
have gone on for a very long time. You've come back to them, picked them up.
[Welles] Yeah, there are only two main projects which are unfinished.
Don Quixote.
And the other one, which has been much longer is The Other Side of the Wind.
[man] I don't know how many other pictures Orson's got somewhere
that were never finished. A few, a few.
[Bogdanovich] The Deep was finished.
He just needed to loop the actors.
But he never did.
[Antoine] The Merchant of Venice. If you are listening to Orson,
the sound was stolen, that's the reason why he didn't finish the picture.
[man] The Dreamers.
The Dreamers was a major project that would've been a really beautiful film.
[interviewer] Do you like to finish a picture and be done with it?
Are you happy when it's all done and cut?
[Welles] No.
No, because you always hope you can make it better.
I hate every kind of goodbye.
And every time those lights go out, it's a little death and a little goodbye.
[man] I have a feeling,
for which I have no evidence,
that he never wanted to finish The Other Side of the Wind.
[man] I always thought that we would never finish the film until he died.
Because...
he felt that if we finished the film he would die.
On the other hand...
[Oja] This question:
Orson did not like to finish his films.
There is really no logic in it, because not to finish his films
would have been suicidal, and Orson loved life.
And life for him
mainly consisted of making the movies.
It implied that he would act in other director's movies
in order to finance and to direct his own.
Then just before the end,
he would throw away all this money and effort,
which he invested into his film,
for the sheer pleasure of not finishing it.
[man] The myth of him not wanting to complete his films
is complete and total nonsense.
[woman chuckles] Such bullshit.
[man] He wanted to finish them correctly.
I mean, look at the movies that were finished.
Hello!
[Oja] One can only imagine what the pain and suffering he endured through the years when he did finish.
he endured through the years when he did finish.
Kane. Othello. Macbeth.
Stranger. Mr. Arkadin. And The Trial.
Touch of Evil. Lady from Shanghai. Immortal Story.
Chimes at Midnight. F for Fake.
And, of course,
he did everything to continue with The Other Side of the Wind.
[man] I used to see him at Ma Maison,
a French restaurant in Los Angeles.
[man 2] He would eat there seven days a week.
[man 3] He'd go to Ma Maison for lunch.
[man 4] He had his own table,
and there was mostly business involved. I mean, like Burt Reynolds.
[man 5] Jack Nicholson.
[man 4] Henry Jaglom was a regular.
-I'll finish this. -[man] Yes.
-Chewing the burger. -[man chuckles]
He wasn't the ogre everybody thought he was, at all.
[man 6] This weird notion
that Orson was sitting around Ma Maison doing fuck all
is insulting.
Miss Tracy. Prepare the standard rich and famous contract
for Kermit the Frog and company.
[Bogdanovich] We'd had all these lunches and we talked about everything.
And he was focusing on getting the film back so he could finish
The Other Side of the Wind.
We created a company called Weljag.
And we lied and we claimed to have several million dollars
to pay the Shah of Iran's brother
the million and a half he was asking for.
And that would free the film.
He was outrageous. He was willing to completely lie,
because he didn't have any respect for the stupid process
that had held his film back.
So, we went and we testified.
[Welles] The great part of the film
was made before there was a partnership with the Iranians.
[Bogdanovich] We were appealing on the basis of the Code Napoléon,
that says the artist owns the film.
It's close to being finished,
but the failure of the Iranians
to pay the money they were supposed to
delayed us for years,
and several actors died.
[Bogdanovich] That's what his whole focus was, finishing The Other Side of the Wind.
And then the French judiciary announced
the producer owns the film.
Not Orson.
So, he's back to stage one.
[Welles] You have to protect yourself.
There are subjects we don't think about.
You know, it's like avoiding the mirror.
I don't much like to look in any form of mirror.
[man] In Orson's life,
there's a sense of the essential untrustworthiness of people.
It's a world view, and that really does run
pretty well through everything.
After that, I knew I couldn't trust him.
He was mad.
[man 2] Betrayal was key to all of Orson's work.
[man 3] They're mostly about two guys who love each other,
and one betrays the other.
[man] Gosh, this is difficult territory,
but it must have stemmed from something in his life.
Actually, it starts as early as you like.
There are a number of betrayals in Welles' childhood...
I don't like a pair of eyes...
[man] ...that were absolutely fundamental to him, formative to him.
...staring at me.
[Bogdanovich] His childhood was a mess.
With no look in them.
[Bogdanovich] His mother died, died on his birthday.
And then his father was a drunk.
He told his father that he didn't wanna see him unless he was sober.
His father died.
[man] Suicide, take one.
[man 2] Welles was convinced his father committed suicide.
"Would-be suicide?"
[man 2] Drank himself to death in a hotel room in Chicago when Welles was 15.
-[Welles] Announce it again. -[man] Suicide, take two.
[man 3] This was the greatest source of guilt in his life.
[man 2] And he said, "I don't think you can get over your guilt."
[man 2] And he said, "I don't think you can get over your guilt." He said, "You have to live with your guilt."
[interviewer] This treason...
is a theme that you use in other films.
Either people betray their best friends,
or they betray their values in which they believe.
or they betray their values in which they believe. -[Welles] Yes. -Uh...
[Welles] Which is worse, do you think?
[interviewer] I suppose it's to betray the values in which you believe.
There we are!
Now we found the difference between us.
To me, the worst thing is to betray a friend.
[Bogdanovich] We were very close for a while.
And I loved him, and I think he loved me.
[Welles] I like him. I like him very much.
I consider him a true friend.
And I ask you to welcome him. Burt Reynolds.
[Bogdanovich] But Bert Reynolds and Orson,
they said a couple of not very nice things about me, on television.
We have a mutual friend, of course, Peter Bogdanovich.
That's right. As a matter of fact,
you have me to thank for the fact that you were asked to be
in the picture which was probably the least successful of any in your past.
My feeling was that the picture needed you.
Yeah.
No, it needed a lot more.
-[Welles] That's right. -[sighs]
[Reynolds] I had the distinction of getting him on this show
and having him host the show.
-[Welles] How did you get him off? -Well, that was the thing.
[Huston] This is the one that hurts.
This is a scene we both hoped we'd never get to.
Hey.
Remember when you first appeared on that location of mine?
Yeah, I didn't even have
fare back home. Just that...
secondhand tape recorder.
A raggedy-ass kid.
[Bogdanovich] So, I wrote him a note in which I said,
"I tuned in last night to see what you think about me
and I guess I found out."
And he sent me back a envelope...
[Welles] The envelope.
[Bogdanovich] ...with two letters in it.
One said he was absolutely horrified
and that he felt he'd betrayed our friendship.
And the other letter said I deserved it.
He said, "Take your pick."
What'd I do wrong, Daddy?
You can kiss my sweet ass.
[interviewer] Last Picture Show, Paper Moon.
Some of those early films. They said, "Bogdanovich is
the best we've got. He's on his way."
They don't say that anymore.
What happened?
[man] Peter, due to personal situations,
ended up on the rocks in a number of ways.
But Orson was way beyond being on the rocks.
Orson was the rocks and the waves and the wind.
Cut.
[Bogdanovich] Many years later,
we started talking on the phone again a bit.
But it wasn't the same.
And I said to him,
"I feel like I made so many mistakes."
And he said,
"Well...
it does seem to be impossible to go through life
without making a great many of them."
He died within a week later.
Our next speaker has been Orson's friend and cameraman for about 15 years,
and a friend, very good friend. Underline.
He worked on The Other Side of the Wind and F for Fake...
[woman] At the memorial, Gary broke down.
That was a big piece of his life gone, you know?
He had more contact with Orson than he did with his children.
The thing that's sad to me really is that
I wanna talk to Orson.
I wish I could talk to him
and tell him a lot of things right now. That's...
that's what probably
makes me feel saddest of all.
[man] It just broke your heart.
He said stuff like,
"I don't know what to do tomorrow." You know?
And, uh...
He said, "I wake up every morning, what I do is
I call Orson and he tells me what I'm supposed to do today.
And I don't know what to do tomorrow."
[man] Gary ended up with Orson's ashes
in the trunk of his car for a year and a half,
waiting for... where are we gonna bury him, you know?
[man] I'm sorry for all the...
great things that Orson did
that were never shown.
And that's why I keep after you, Gary.
I keep hoping The Other Side of the Wind will be released.
This-- This is what we started The Other Side of the Wind with.
Arriflex.
And then Orson could look there.
[man] There was a work print amidst Gary's belongings.
[woman] And he did try to cut the movie before he died.
But...
without Orson, it didn't track.
Gary would have the story perfect in his head, he just couldn't get it on film.
[man] But without any doubt,
I believe that my father would've
-immediately answered "yes." -[Gary] Yes.
That he would do it all over again.
[Shepherd] A lot of people wanna see The Other Side of the Wind get made.
[man 1] It is the greatest movie never released, you know.
[man 2] What did Orson really mean by it?
What is its... its true form?
It's an eternal quest.
[man] I shot Someone to Love, which is Orson's last movie as an actor, before he died.
And he turns to me and he says...
"We come into the world alone, we die alone, we live alone.
Love and friendship is the nearest thing
that we can find
to create the illusion
that we are not totally alone."
[man] So, I'm working on that, after Orson died,
and I get a knock on my door. And it's John Huston.
He says, "You have footage of Orson that I haven't seen."
I said, "Well, I'll put it up for you."
As far as this movie is concerned, it seems to me you've got your ending.
[man] Why?
-[man] I'm glad you came today. -So am I.
[man] Thank you. Stay a little longer?
[man] Thank you. Stay a little longer? [Welles] Really can't go on recording this.
-[man] Why? -[Welles] It's got too sweet.
[man] I'm not gonna say "cut."
I'll say "cut." I'm a director.
-Say it-- -Cut!
-Say it into the camera. -What?
-Say it into the camera. -I did.
Can you do it again?
You want me to say "cut" again?
-Into the camera-- -[Welles] Wants to improvise
and do it twice. Cut!
[man] Huston turned to me and he said,
"He let you do that?"
He said, "Oh, that's wonderful. I've always wanted him on film laughing.
That was so--" And he started crying.
He started crying, Huston.
Watching Orson laughing.
Clips of films, the cans, the years of work and ideas.
Did Welles see it all as an endless loop
full of sound and fury, signifying nothing?
Or, perhaps for him,
failure was simply a more interesting ending.
[man] Orson talked about ways to re-imagine The Other Side of the Wind.
How did he put it?
Supposing, during the course of the picture, that it turns out
that it's more interesting hearing the actors and myself talk about it
than making the picture. That will be the picture.
Oh, maybe that's what he was talking about. [laughs]
Maybe he was saying that The Other Side of the Wind was like a documentary.
[man 2] At one point, he was talking about turning it into a documentary.
[man 3] Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[man 4] As he always had done, innovating with the form.
[man 5] You were showing people making a movie.
So, it was like a documentary.
See what I mean? It's that-- It's that free.
Maybe it isn't even the picture.
Maybe it's just talking about making the picture.
We're just gonna go.
Let me show that again.
Maybe it's just talking about making the picture.
[Bogdanovich] Well, that makes perfect sense to me.
I remember him talking to me about that.
[Bogdanovich] It's all in the editing.
[man 1] The Other Side of the Wind and his life were inseparable.
[man 2] The whole documentary that we're all so accustomed to today...
he was inventing.
[woman] Well, who's gonna watch this film?
What kind of people do you think are gonna be your audience?
Then I hear the guy's re-upped for five years.
[man 2] The label hated it.
[Kevin Nealon] This castle belongs to the Duke of Gloucester.
So I realize that was the guy who kept angrily staring at me the whole time.
-[laughs] -[man] Hey, Kevin. Hey, Lorne. -You ready for this? -Yeah, what's that?
Oh, oh! We're gonna do the thing. Okay. All right, you want to start it off?
-Talk to you, or talk to the lens? -[man] Either way.
So, Sandy Wexler...
[smacks lips] Where do I begin?
He may be the most unique guy I ever met.
If you were working in Los Angeles in the '90s, any time in there,
you'd run into Sandy Wexler at some point.
Sandy was one of those fringe Hollywood managers that you always sort of saw around.
You know, you'd see him at a wrap party, and he'd be laughing, stuffing his face.
You'd think, "No one even invited this guy."
Sandy said I could be the next Patrick Swayze. [scoffs]
Only thing he ever said to me that made sense.
Sandy was not a big shot. He was a... He was a tiny shot.
But anybody who met him, you never forgot him.
You know, you gotta remember there was no YouTube, there was no Vines.
And none of that... None of the social media platforms.
You really needed a guy like Sandy to be seen.
Not Sandy. Not Sandy, but a guy like Sandy.
Hey, Arsenio! Nice to see you again, kiddo.
Have I seen you before?
[laughs] Yeah, it's Sandy Wexler.
I met you at Bernie's beach house, with Doug and Danny.
You guys were playing hangman.
You were hysterical that night. No one could figure out the word "canoe."
I have no idea what you're talking about, man.
How you doing with your manager, kid? Are you still fighting?
I don't have a manager, man. Well, you do now. If you want one.
No, I'm good. I... I have an agent.
-Oh. -As a matter of fact, I have six agents. Got plenty of white people in my life.
-All right. -I'm good, dawg.
An agent is business. A manager is family.
He guides you. He advises you. He fights the good fights.
Makes the tough phone calls.
Truth is, I'm not happy unless... unless you're happy.
So what do you say, Arsenio? You wanna get happy together?
Continued success, Arsenio!
-[whooping] Okay? Oh! -[pager beeping]
I got a hit on the hip, and it's Sinbad.
I don't think any of those people were really beeping him.
'Cause he would just go, like, "Oh, jeez, Mackenzie Phillips."
The one thing about Sandy is,
-he just never stopped lying. -Always.
Managers get used to lying, but Sandy took it to an art form.
Where am I? I'm in Joel Silver's office right now, talking about you.
If you land on your feet-- Hey, buddy, how long are you gonna be?
Excuse me, I am talking to Lew Wasserman's neighbor right now.
That was Janet Maslin from the Times.
Sandy's personal life?
-I know nothing. I know nothing. -Did he have a personal life?
-He wasn't married. -Didn't date.
It was sad. Seemed like he didn't have any friends, right? He had no friends.
Any good?
[Sandy] No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's great.
[stammering] But he was the king of the fake laugh -and the applauding combo. Yeah. -Combo. Yeah.
-and the applauding combo. Yeah. -Combo. Yeah.
Next time he'll get his own ketchup.
You gotta go.
Is Mary Jo Slater the casting agent on this?
-No. I don't know. -Good job, guys.
I was in Nam. But, you know, I was there in 1984,
so it was... It was a different vibe.
And then all I hear in the back is...
-He would fake laugh at funny comics. -That melon.
It was like, "Why are you fake laughing? -It's Eddie Murphy. He's funny." -[Dana Carvey] Right!
When it came to eating with Sandy, he, um...
It was like a smorgasbord on his face.
I mean, he was on the Atkins diet, right? So he always had, like, chicken...
-Kielbasa. -T-bone steak.
-Brisket. -Beef jerky.
I never actually ate with Sandy, but I did hear it was kind of gross.
Can you close your mouth just a little bit?
What did I do?
He dressed like your grandfather,
he had the table manners of a horse, but he was a great manager.
He really cared about his clients.
He made them his family. He was with them all the time.
And, uh, I wasn't sure what he was doing for them, but you could feel the love.
I spoke to Chili's. I think I can get us the corner table there
and preorder the appetizers.
I don't give a shit about Chili's right now. I thought you wanted to go to Chili's.
-No, I never said that. -You said that. That's okay.
You're nervous. I can see that you're sweating.
-I'm scared, Sandy. -Yeah.
I gotta jump over ten trailers and land on a waterbed.
Why are you laughing?
Because you're funny. You make me laugh.
-Well, I'm not trying to be funny. -No, it's the way you said it.
The way I said... What are you... [sighs] Look at the size of this crowd.
You said they'd come, and they came.
Ladies and gentlemen of El Segundo Motor Home Court,
here to defy gravity,
please let's welcome Wild Gary Roberts!
-Rodgers! -Rodgers!
He said that. He said Rodgers. Yeah, 'cause I told him to!
He said it the first time.
I... I wish we could... 'Cause he did say it the first time.
-Stop talking. -All right. I will.
You get up there and you show these people who you are.
Gary Rodgers. It's Gary Rodgers. You said that, right?
The second time.
Yeah, but you knew it.
Okay, guys, let's do this.
What are you saying? I don't know what you're...
What are you pointing to? I can only go forward.
Oh, my God.
He's really gonna jump over all those trailers?
Sir, my client is the best daredevil trapeze artist in the world. Thank you very much.
[breathes heavily] Let's go.
Yeah!
-What? -[screeching]
-[Gary groans] -Oh, shit!
-Jesus Christ! -[laughing]
[straining] Sandy.
-He had this one guy, Ted Rafferty... -Oh, yeah.
...who was a, you know, puppet act. Not that good. Like, a middle act.
He believed in him. He thought he was the greatest.
He's like, "I'm gonna make him the next Mr. Buttons."
So, uh, Charlie, have you always been a puppet?
Well, I don't know. Have you always been a parade float?
[Ted] I'm just trying to get to know you better, that's all. [Charlie] Know me better? I'm sitting on your lap.
No, but seriously, what's it like being a puppet? Well, I come from a long line of puppets.
My father was a puppet. My father's father was a puppet.
Really? Was your father's father's father a puppet?
Wait for the punch line, buddy.
Somebody call JCPenney. One of the mannequins is on the loose.
Sir, have you ever had a date in your life?
Actually, I have. Your Anita Bryant poster doesn't count.
But honestly, sir, how long have you been dead for?
Where do you come up with this stuff? I wish you didn't.
That was hysterical. So you caught the whole show, then?
I saw every word of it. It was sensational.
I saw you come in late!
Nah. Nah, I was there the whole time.
Will you get a load of this bullcrap. I was. I was.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, now, guys, guys, please. All right. Sandy, I... I believe you.
Thank you, Ted.
And I was thinking, you'd do so well now with the beach theater crowd.
And you've got the once a month gig opening for Fred Travalena at the Trop.
I don't wanna lose that.
It might be time to move on to the next level.
Kicking the piss out of you? No. Television.
But... [scoffs]
I don't know the first thing about the TV business. That's why you got me.
-I know my way around the networks. -Liar!
Hey, I've had a relationship with CBS since 1965
when I was a PA on Gilligan's Island.
Now, look, kids love the puppets. And I know there's an audience for that.
Mmm, maybe.
Well, what about this?
I know it's out of left field, but how about a show for kids?
Yeah, I was just saying that.
So we agree.
My favorite thing about Sandy is where he lived.
The place was a palace.
[Henry] He lived on the biggest property in Bel Air. [actor] Yeah.
[Tony] Gorgeous pool.
[Jay] One of the finest collections of luxury cars I've ever seen.
Make sure you hydrate, Yoshi! It's a hot day!
[Tony] Of course, none of it belonged to Sandy.
It was owned by some Jewish Iranian...
The guy never even set foot in the United States.
...who needed Sandy there for legal reasons.
And he was not allowed in the main house.
He was in the cabana by the pool.
-[dog barking and growling] -No, no, no, no.
Oh, no! Oh, no, no! No, no, no!
Stay! Stay! Stay!
I've lived here for four years already. You should know me by now.
Get to see the face. The king of Hollywood.
Do you understand me? -[Amy] Sandy? -Ahh!
Oh. Hi, uh, Amy. Hi, Donna and Kendra.
-Lola. -Jesse.
Yeah, that's right. Wow, they're getting sharp.
What brings you all the way out here from Tarzana?
Well, you said you'd watch the kids while I go on the audition. Is that still okay?
Oh, don't be silly. Of course. We're gonna have a good time, guys.
I have to get it, Sandy. I'm working two jobs just to tread water out here.
You're the quintessential American mother. Oscar Mayer would be crazy to pass on you.
Oscar Mayer? I thought I was auditioning to play a hooker in a Wes Craven movie.
You know what? My doctor put me on a new thyroid medicine.
He said it might make me foggy, and I guess he was right.
-Okay, Sandy, I'm gonna go. -Yeah.
Girls, be nice to Mr. Wexler. Okay? Yes, Mommy.
-Oh, we're gonna have fun, guys. -Okay.
-Go get 'em, kid. Go get 'em. -Okay.
Oh, there's dogs out there. They--
Hey! Hi, guys. Hi, sweet girl. Hi.
So what are you shmegegges up for?
I have the original script of On Golden Pond.
Do you wanna read that out loud?
No?
What would you like to do?
Go swimming?
No, no, no. That could get me kicked out of here.
I thought you were the king of Hollywood? I never said that.
-You said it to the dogs. -Like a minute ago.
No, I didn't.
You guys like roller coasters?
-Unbelievable. -[girls screaming]
Rifkin left Triad and he's joining forces with Zifkin over at William Morris.
After I was promoted out of the mailroom at MCA, I was assigned to Frank Gorshin.
And Frank Gorshin used to have me hand-wash the Riddler costume,
because he felt washing machines might stretch out the material.

Excuse me. You were fantastic up there.
-Oh, thanks. You're sweet. -Yeah.
It's corny, but it's fun.
Corny? That had an edge to it. I'm Sandy Wexler.
Courtney. Nice to meet you.
I just... I couldn't keep my eyes off you up there.
Please don't hit on me in front of your kids. That's creepy.
-He's not our dad. -No, I'm not.
He's the king of Hollywood. She thinks I said that to the dogs, but I didn't.
Listen, can we talk somewhere? I'm a talent manager.
I kinda gotta go. We have a show every 12 minutes.
It'll take four minutes of your time. It'll be worth it.
...someone who advises you, someone who guides you,
who makes the tough phone calls, fights the big fights.
Atkins.
I mean, your voice,
it sounds like a... a bird and an angel had a baby.
And you just so happen to be beautiful.
You can't teach beautiful.
If you could, I'd be in class right now, believe me. [laughs]
I'm telling you, you could be somebody.
Come on. If I was gonna be anybody, I'd be her by now.
Everybody's gotta start somewhere.
Buddy Hackett was a dishwasher in the Catskills till he was 60.
Barbra Streisand started as a backup singer in a petting zoo.
Liza Minnelli used to sing in a coal mine.
Wasn't her mother Judy Garland? No, that's made up.
[stammers] The mightiest tornado starts with a small breeze.
You sound like a fortune cookie. I used to represent a guy who wrote fortune cookies.
[scoffs] Get out of here.
Yeah, he wrote for Happy Days and fortune cookies.
Let me ask you something.
Why do you do what you do?
I don't know.
The only time I really feel alive is when I'm singing.
Well, imagine if you were singing on stage in front of 50,000 people.
You think you'd feel alive then?
Up there singing like a bird and an angel had a baby?
You like the bird and angel thing, don't you?
I said that already?
-Can I ask you something? -Please do.
Can you get any of that food in your mouth?
So you're saying I should quit right now and leave with you?
You're too big for this duck pond. It's time to fly.
You like to make trouble, don't you, Sandy?
What do you say? Wanna team up?
I'll tell you what I told Josh Gelfand in the sixth grade
-when he asked me to the spring social. -Uh-huh.
I'd love to, but we gotta ask my dad first.
[Courtney] I guess I should have mentioned my Dad's in Seward, Alaska.
[Sandy] Oh, that's fine. I love it there.
It's beautiful.
-Oh, you've been? -No, I haven't been there.
-But you just said-- -No, I didn't.
[Courtney] I guess I should have also mentioned the prison thing.
[Sandy] Are you kidding?
-I was in prison my entire childhood. -[sighs]
An emotional prison. That's a life sentence, I'm telling you.
-The Yugo, imported from France. -[Courtney] Isn't it from Yugoslavia?
[Sandy] No. "You go" to France. "You go" and have a good time. Bonjour.
Hey, Poppy.
How you doing?
Oh, it's always a great day when I see my little girl.
Mr. Clarke, truly a pleasure. Sandy Wexler of Wexler Artists.
Is this the fool that want to manage you?
Um, yes, I did come up here to talk to you about that.
[stammering] And if you're available to speak, you know, and now's the time,
I would love to have a conversation about this.
If we could conversate, I'm here to--
What about Six Flags Magic Mountain?
I mean, she got benefits, a paycheck every week. That mountain is truly magical.
No, it is.
I just, with all due respect, I think your daughter has the magic.
With her talent, she could have a dream-come-true life.
You mean, better than all of this?
What?
Dad.
Who else have you managed?
You ever hear of Indiana Jones?
You work with Harrison Ford?
No, but I do represent the guy
who got his heart pulled out of his chest in Temple of Doom.
I love that guy.
Everybody does.
I don't know anything about show business, Sandy. How do I know if I can trust you?
Because I can look you dead in the eye and promise you this:
I will always do what's best for your daughter.
Well, okay. In that case...
♪ You got a new manager ♪
♪ Thank you, Daddy ♪
♪ What a wonderful moment ♪
The singing is just for us. Okay. Good. Will do... Will never do it again.
You guys want to go out and celebrate?
I can't go nowhere.
Oh, that's right. I'm sorry. Please don't shiv me.
Shiv you? Man, I ain't no inmate. I work here. I've got... got the night shift.
What the... What?
Got ya.
Very good.
Darling, you should take Sandy out for a dinner and a show, Alaskan style.
-[Sandy] That's amazing. -[Courtney] Right?
So good.
The northern lights and my new friend Sandy.
That's as good as it gets.
Northern lights are something else. I was actually talking about the burger, though.
-Is this bison, or is it moose meat? -[laughing] [stammers] What's making it so good?
It's a hamburger, crazy man.
-A hamburger? -And you're missing out without the bun. Now, the bun...
If I lose five more pounds, it's back to the buns. Oh, my God.
So you really think I could be somebody?
-You are going straight to the top. -Yeah?
Up there with all the other beautiful stars.
Show me which star I am. -You wanna know which star you are? -Yeah.
-You wanna know which star you are? -Yeah. Let's see.
You are that one right there.
[Courtney] Sandy, that's an airplane.
I know. I told you, you were going places.
-That's real smooth, Sandy. -Thank you.
You must be a real lady-killer.
Listen,
if we're gonna do business together, we gotta have boundaries.
I'm sorry, but I learned that the hard way.
A bad breakup?
His name was Alfred.
Oh, you're gay!
I can see that now.
No, I'm not gay as far as I know.
-Alfred was my first client. -Mmm-hmm.
More than that. He was... He was my best friend.
Did he die?
No, no.
He got famous, and he, uh... and he dumped me.
That dick!
He wasn't a dick. I was the dick. It was my fault.
I let the friendship get in the way of the business.
Now understand it's show business, not show friendship. Right?
That is so sad.
It's not sad. It's actually a good thing.
Because I got a stable of talent in Hollywood
that I, quite frankly, think is the best of the bunch.
And Eisner knows it, and Ovitch knows it.
I'm sorry, and I don't wanna toot my own horn
'cause that's not what I like to do, but toot-toot.
Best thing to me is I found you.
I'm glad you found me.
You're not as happy as I am. Trust me.
But we gotta get to work.
Whenever Sandy signed a new client,
he had a team of support people that immediately began making over the client.
He would just enroll everybody in classes for the stuff they didn't do.
Movement, martial arts...
A posture person, and then a hair person.
-And no one was better off after that. -No.
It was a train wreck.
I'm not a dancer, Sandy.
-It doesn't matter if you can't dance. -It's all right.
-Miss Gideon is gonna teach you to move. -I got you, sweetheart.
-It's about presence on stage. -All right. That's enough, Sandy.
-All right. Here we go. -It's about being comfortable.
-You know, Baryshnikov, I hear-- -Shut it, Sandy. I got her.
-["I'm Gonna Get You" playing] -Who me? Who me? Who me?
I'm a rock star. I'm a rock star.
And pass the mic. Pass the mic. Down the mic. Down the mic.
[Sandy] That's it. That's it.
-That's it. Now you're in it. -[Gideon] Bobby Brown.
More madness! Stomp the ant.
Seattle. Seattle.
-[Sandy] She doesn't know how to dance? -You're a diva!
-This girl can do it all. -Feel it. And stop!
Hammer time!
[Sandy] Wonderful.
[Yuri] Okay. Let's see it.
-[shutter clicks] -Very good.
Very bad.
Complete shit.
You know what? I don't like the ice cream. It's a bad idea. Looks terrible.
Now let's go sexy, huh? Can you give me some sexy, Courtney?
Come on. Let's put on some sexy music, Willow.
Okay. Yes. Let's shoop this shit. Shoop it up, huh?
Let's shoop the shoop. Show me the sexy. Come on.
Give me sexy. Honey, think of something sexy, huh?
-Like what? -Like moose burgers.
-[chuckles] -And there it is. Shoot that.
Ah, Sandy likes it. No one knows why. Put your hand on your chin.
Not like you're stroking a beard. Like you're thinking, thinking filthy thoughts.
Like wieners!
Ah, that's good, Willow! Wieners is good. You're brilliant today.
Ah, that's good, Willow! Wieners is good. You're brilliant today. Come on. Hand on chin, thinking of wieners.
I suck at this.
-No, you don't. You're great. -Oh, come on.
It... You just... It's easy.
Then you do it, Sandy. -Come on. Get over here. -No, no, no, no.
-You're a performer. I don't do that. -Come on, Sandy.
You said it's easy. Dream of the wieners, huh?
Come over here. Come on. Do I wear my glasses, or do I take them off? Or...
Nobody gives a shit. Come on.
-You put your hand on the chin. -Uh-huh.
You just... You think.
Huh? Just thinking. Little more thinking over here.
[Yuri] Yes, that's brilliant.
Beautiful. Thank you, Sandy. Clear out of frame.
-Get out. -No, I'm gonna miss him.
No, you'll be fine. Sexy will be right over here.
-Don't worry. -I'll be there.
He's still got his hand on his chin. He's so cute.
Ah, that's much better.
[Sandy] Yes, that's it.
[Yuri] Yes, now I see sexy.
The definition of, like, a given
is that kids wake up and they think, "Me so horny."
And then, you know, you don't need a song that just reinforces, they know they're so horny.
If it was, like, "Me So Introspective" or something like that.
Or "Me So Ambivalent" or...
Just so good. Talk about fearless. Best in town by far.
Isn't she?
She? Who's she?
What?
-Did you call him? -Yeah, I called him.
What'd he say?
-What'd who say? -The guy you called.
Who did I call?
The guy from the Young Comedians Special.
Oh, yeah. No, I gotta call him.
-So you didn't call him? -No, I called him.
No, you didn't. I thought you called him.
Sandy, you're making even less sense than usual. No, I'm not.
-Something's off. -Off how?
I don't know. Different.
Did you dye your hair or something?
I don't think so.
Maybe it's a brain tumor.
Maybe it is.
-Anyway, can we run lines? -Yeah, that's why I'm here.
I need to know the truth, you son of a bitch!
All right, I dyed my hair. Just the tips. You happy?
No, the line, Sandy.
I know. I was improvising.
But you want this line? Um...
"The truth? You wouldn't know the truth if it bit you on the--"
Bird.
We gotta find a way. Don't you think, Sandy?
Sandy?
A way? What way?
A way to get rid of the birds.
Yeah, a bird and a baby had an angel.
Are you stoned or something?
Stoned? I don't do pot. Come on.
Well, you seem stoned out of your mind. What's with the crazy smile?
I don't know, I'm just smiling at the fact you might become the new Captain Kangaroo.
He's lying again.
No, I'm not. I'm not lying.
I've been thinking about how you can work on your kid-friendly material.
Maybe go to Magic Mountain.
When you see all the children on line, just start doing jokes for 'em.
-See if it works. -That feels very child molestery.
He wants to ruin you. Fire him!
Fire me? If you're firing anybody, I'd fire him. He's useless. He does nothing.
I do everything! What do you do? Guys, guys, guys! Come on, we're on the same team here.
-That's what I'm trying to tell him. -Yes.
Teammates?
Yeah, thank you.
-You took my arm! You took my arm! -Oh, come off it. That's--
-You took my arm! -That's not...
[Ed McMahon on TV] Thank you, Martin.
Let's find out who the judges chose as returning champ tonight.
The judges gave Kevin Connors one star
and the champion, Martin Lawrence, four stars!
The new champion, Martin Lawrence.
-[phone ringing] -Oh... Come on.
Wexler Artists.
-[Kevin] It's me. -Hi, Kevin.
Did you know that was on?
No. I didn't know they were gonna repeat it.
-I never want to see that again! -Well...
I can't stop them, Kevin, legally, 'cause we signed an agreement.
It's... They own the material.
Well, she'd light up a room in that purple one.
[man] Sandy!
[chuckles] Barry Bubatzi.
Barry.
[stammering] Yeah, I was Carr D'Angelo's assistant?
-Hiccups? That's you? -Yeah.
-Look at this. Hiccups. -[laughs] Yeah.
Bubatzi!
He... he called me Hiccups because I had the hiccups this one time I was on the phone with him.
Well, listen, he didn't just have the hiccups, -he had the hiccups. -[both chuckle]
-He wouldn't stop hiccupping. -Yeah.
Uh, you can die from hiccups. I was terrified.
I was actually concerned.
-[both laugh] -It was nerve-racking. A little bit.
How's your sister? Did she get into Penn State?
-She just graduated. -Another successful Bubatzi.
-You see, that is why I love this guy. -What?
[stammers] He actually talked to me when I was just an assistant.
You treated me with respect, Sandy.
-Not many people did. -Well, of course.
-This is my girl, Mary. -Hi.
Mary. Sandy Wexler.
-Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.
Are you... What happened to your arm?
-Yeah, I got myself a tattoo. -What'd you get?
Uh... it is that of a dog bite.
So how's Carr D'Angelo?
Well, he, uh... he left. He's working for Blockbuster Video now.
Smart move. The music business has its ups and downs,
but Blockbuster Video's here for the long haul.
And you, what are you up to?
I left, too. -I'm at Capitol Records now. -Oh.
He's head of A&R.
You know how happy that makes me?
Hiccups Bubatzi goes big time.
That's just... That's the way it should be.
You worked your ass off, kiddo.
Can I talk business for a second? Is that all right? I have a client that, actually, you would love to meet--
-Tell you what... -What?
Call my office next week. Yeah.
I mean, you sure? 'Cause I will call.
-[laughs] I know. -[laughs]
-It was great seeing you, pal. -It was great seeing you.
And I hope, uh, one of those dresses works out for you.
-Oh, no, this isn't... -[Mary] Cute.
-[laughing] It was... I mean... -So good.
It's a Bubatzi world. We're all just--
Could you please not block the whole aisle?
We're all just living in it. I wasn't blocking the aisle.
-Hi. -Hey, neighbor.
Hi, Cindy!
Where's that billionaire landlord of yours? Is he ever going to grace us with his presence?
[laughs] What a question.
Listen, he's supposed to come out for Rosh Hashanah,
but he said last year Purim, so who knows? -[laughs] -But anyways, how are you?
-[laughs] -But anyways, how are you? How is your husband?
Doctors say it could be any day now. Hmm.
Oh, I'm so sorry. It's just...
How are you doing? No one ever asks how you're doing.
How you feeling?
The truth is that I'm just... a little bit lonely.
You were together so long. Of course you're lonely.
So if you ever see my tennis court lights on at night...
that means that I could use some company.
-It was great to see you, Cindy. -Bye, Sandy.
Okay, we're gonna go. All right. Good night, now.
Good night.
Look, Gary Rodgers can't make that jump
unless you clear every bird from the sky, Tom.
I don't know. Is there a spray for it? Like, a... a roach spray or...
There's dogs. There's dogs.
A roach spray for birds.
Tom, I'm sorry. That's not my job. That's your job.
That's why I'm telling you.
I'm telling ya!
Listen, don't do that to me! I'll pull the plug on this thing!
Do you hear me?
All right. I'm sorry I got hot there, Tom, but you weren't listening.
Okay, here's a stock tip for you to make up for that.
Pull all your money out of Apple, 'cause no one's using the Macintosh anymore.
Put 80% into small local bookstores, the other 20% into Woolworth's.
-Righto. -[hangs up]
-Look at you, Mr. Manager Man. -You don't wanna yell at people,
-Look at you, Mr. Manager Man. -You don't wanna yell at people, but sometimes it's the only way they can hear.
You look stunning.
Well, this yard is the most amazing yard I've ever seen, and that pool--
The pool's off-limits. House rules. So, Yuri stopped by my office.
Yeah, I know. He's right there.
You see him? Let's go over.
[Yuri] We need to find the one that expresses the right message. You know, "I'm fun. I'm complicated. I'm sexy."
You know, "I'm fun. I'm complicated. I'm sexy."
I'm confused. I'm crazy. I'm embarrassed.
You're beautiful is what you are. Stop that.
-[pager beeping] -Got a hit on the hip.
This is someone I actually have to call.
Okay, I'll be back in a few seconds.
Okay, cool, we'll be in the pool.
-You stay out of the pool. -[chuckles]
I was just kidding.
I know, and it was hysterical. But seriously, stay out of the pool.
No, not you, Barry. Hi!
-I don't know how you do it. -Do what?
Deal with all the crazy Sandy shit.
-Man, he's such a-- -Boner face?
-I love that. -He's not a boner face.
-He's a badass. -Okay.
Well, listen, this girl is one of the best singers you'll ever see,
and the best, brightest person ever.
I'm gonna go with the one on the top right corner.
And can you blow up... that one?
Oh, my God.
What? It's a good picture.
Sandy already asked me to do that for him.
I have some interesting news.
Capitol Records wants to meet with you next week.
They want to hear your demo.
I don't have a demo.
That's why you have me.

Courtney, one take. Perfection.
[muffled] You nailed it. That was...
Thank you so much.
[muffled] I'm gonna play this back in here.
I can't get over what I just heard. Wow.
My God.
Play it back. I... I don't even know what to say right now.
There's a chance I forgot to hit record.
What do you mean there's a chance you forgot? -I... I was gonna hit record... -Uh-huh.
Uh, then I forgot.
So it's more than a chance. -You... you did forget? -Yes.
Okay, so what do we do now?
Is it another deck you have? Is it in the board?
No.
-So we'll have to do it again. -Okay.
Okay? It's okay with you?
If it's okay with you to do it again.
-That's where we are right now, huh? -Okay.
Let's just go again.
Courtney, there was an issue on the subwoofer.
It was a bit tinny.
We adjusted that, and we're ready for you this time.
I'm sorry. On us, not you. Just one more time.
We're gonna keep our eyes on the road. Okay?
You got it.
Please promise me it's as good as your first one. [chuckles] I'm... Ha!

Sandy, um, my dad wanted to make sure that I said hi to you.
-Your father, Marty? -Yeah.
Say hi for me. He's a good man. A smart man.
Um, he felt bad that you didn't get into Hillcrest Country Club this year.
Oh, listen, that's not his fault. I was... That was fine. There's other clubs.
No, actually I think that his was the deciding vote.
No. It's a capacity thing. It's not his fault. It's...

-All right. We're glad you're here. -Okay. Good.
So anyway, now that we got the formalities out of the way...
Everybody got their Fruitopia? Good, good, good.
So, spoke to Barry.
And, uh, Barry wanted us to listen to your demo, and I gotta say, some good stuff there.
Thank you.
Just to... I mean, to me, no one's doing what this kid is doing out there.

It's definitely Whitney. It's a Whitney, 100%.
-Yeah, it has potential. -Well, hold on now. The production quality is complete shit.
Complete shit. Terrible.
But the song has potential. Yeah, no diggity, no doubt.
-Thank you. -That's it.
The song is all we're worried about. You gotta lose the corny triangle, though, man.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, consider that gone.
Let me ask you something, man. Whose insane idea was that, anyway?
Whose idea was it? Was it your idea? No, it was that... It was the engineer's.
I gotta be honest. It was absolutely ridiculous.
I mean, how big of an asshole do you have to be to say,
"You know what? Let's put a... [imitates triangle chiming] ...at the end of a ballad"?
So, ready to check out our digs?
This is Studio A.
Les Paul helped engineer it, and Sinatra made it infamous.

Yes.

Wow. Thanks, I think?
She doesn't understand how good that is?
No, I do. I'm just grateful you all actually just listened to it.
That's what we do. It's our ritual.
Whenever anybody at Wexler Artists completes a project,
-we gather together. -We do?
We didn't even know you had other clients until today.
Oh, you guys all knew about each other.
I knew you had other clients, but you told me I was in a different league from them.
-That's what the prick told us, too. -[laughs]
Sorry, we've never done the ritual before.
If it's a first time, Sandy, how can it be a ritual?
Okay, and who is that guy?
Can we put him in a drawer or something? That's horrifying.
Sandy, aren't you forgetting the best part of the ritual?
-What's that, dear? -Jumping in the pool.
-Yeah! Let's do it! -Oh, no, no, no, no! No, that's not part of the ritual!
No, no, no, wait! We are not permitted in the pool! Okay?
-Firuz forbids it. -You're not in a cult, are you, Sandy?
No, Firuz is my landlord.
He does not allow us in the pool. It is forbidden.
No, no. All right! Ah! Don't you come any closer, Sandy. I'll put my whole foot in, I swear.
Ah! Don't you come any closer, Sandy. I'll put my whole foot in, I swear.
-No, no! -[stammering]
-Please don't... No! -Ooh!
No, I am not kidding you, Courtney. I will let you go as a client.
-I didn't wanna have to say that. -[Ted] Oh, my God.
Do not put your foot in the pool, or the career is done.
And I'm not... I'm not messing with you. -Oh, God. -I don't care what you're saying.
Okay, you did it! You did it! You did the foot. You did the foot. The foot is wet.
Please come back in the house. I'm asking nicely.
I just don't have... I can't...
I wasn't gonna go in.
I know you weren't gonna go in.
I... I can't joke, too?

Why do you screw Firuz?
-Firuz? -Yes.
I don't see you. Show your face!
I'm in Tehran, you imbecile.
I tell you to stay out of my pool, and what do you do? You go in my pool.
Uh, nobody went in your pool. No, no, who told you that? The dogs?
I have cameras everywhere, man. I'm watching you all the time.
You're much better than anything we have on Iranian TV.
I see you with bacon over the sink,
I see you fall asleep in my chair, watching my Cinemax.
And I see your godless friends in my pool!
No, no, listen, Firuz. Here's what happened.
There was an earthquake in Los Angeles.
So we just went in the pool 'cause it's the safest place to be.
But we didn't go all the way in. No water was touched.
Sandy, you lie all the time, man. It's embarrassing.
I wish I was lying. I wish I was.
And how many times are you going to listen to that one song, my friend?
I mean, mix in a little Miami Sound Machine or something.
It's a client of mine. Courtney Clarke. What, you don't like it?
The song is good, and I like her, too.
You know, when she was in bathroom, I got quite a good look at her.
-You what? -Firuz joking. [chuckles]
I don't have cameras in bathroom anymore.
I had them taken out when you had the big hemorrhoid.
That wasn't a hemorrhoid, that was a fissure.
But, Sandy, people in my pool, this I do not like!
-I-- -That's strike one, Sandy!
I'm telling you--
-You don't want to get strike two. -I... I agree.
-Goodbye from Firuz. -[static]
Bye-bye.
You know, I did tell them not to go in the pool, and they did it anyway.
-So you admit it? -No! I--
Strike two! Firuz knows everything.
[Sandy] Okay, what are we doing today, big guy?
We going to Jerry's? Or you want to go to Carney's?
I can go either one.
It's all good for the Atkins. I can get a frankfurter, no bun.
-I know. -I can get a plate of roast beef...
-or corn beef-- -Don't go over the whole menu. I don't give a shit about your roast beef.

As long as you promise to bring it on the stage with you tonight,

She calls him Quincelius.

Okay, cool. So should we go to the party?
You wanna go to it? Why shouldn't... Let's pop by. He lives in Venice, right?

He heard the song as well on the radio, and he booked her on the show next week.
Carson?
Well, congratulations.
You ever need me, Stage 29. I'll be there forever, baby.
Ah, thanks, Arsenio. No, I didn't mean any problem--
You didn't tell me I was doing Carson next week!
That was a negotiation ploy. I may have overplayed my hand there.

He told me to always sing from the heart.
And I tell this girl, "Always act from the heart."
Hey, did we get the offer on the Mentos commercial I was on hold for?
No, you weren't on hold for it. What I said was,

But when they... they got on the phone, they told me they passed on you.
-Well, there you go. -No, it's good.
They said she had a great reading. That it truly looked like she loved the Mentos.

Courtney blew up to Whitney Houston-type status.
Oh, really?

I think someone's outside my house.
I'm scared it's one of those freaks that's been calling me or something.
What? Who's calling you?
I don't know.
I've been dealing with this ever since I moved into this place.
-Are your doors locked? -Yeah.
You stay inside. I'll be right there.

Are you scared? Huh?

I'm scared I'm gonna shatter every bone in your face!
You're gone?
That's it. Truce.
No more.
What you were so afraid of was nothing but a raccoon. [laughs]
[scoffs] No way.
I'm telling you, you'll never have to worry about him again, though.
You didn't kill him, did you?
No. No. Uh, I...
I seen him go out into the forest again to see his family, so...
All right? But I screamed at him.
I let him know, "Don't come back here. You stay with the...
On your side of the fence."
Okay. Come on in. Let me wash those clothes.

Well, you'll be missing out, then.
Oh, really?
No. Maybe you should turn around.
[chuckles] Turning around.
I'm glad you took this place, by the way.
The real estate lady told me that David Crosby died three times in this house.
I'm gonna keep the beeper, if that's all right.
Kevin Connors did a show on Brea tonight,
co-headlining with AJ Jamal. I wanna make sure that went well.
So, pants are coming down.
Here you go.
All right. Come on. Let's get these washed.
Sure. Hey, thanks for doing that.
You called Bling, too?
Oh, I was here anyway, Sandy.
With my pants on.
The important thing is that Courtney feels safe.
-That's all I'm worried about. -[Courtney] Hmm.
An unlisted phone number.
That's the way to go for an artist of your stature. I can get that done for you tomorrow morning.
Oh, no, it's all... It's all good, Sandy. I handled it already.
Oh, you did? Good. Good. Good for you.
Sandy, can you pass me the gravy?
Can I pass you the gravy? Absolutely. I can pass you the gravy.
-Here. You want me to put it on for you? -I got it.
-You got it? -Yeah.
I was thinking we should get back in the studio, Courtney.
Maybe noodle around with some new tunes.
[chuckles] With all due respect, Sandy, I understand that, but, uh, her existing record's gonna be on the charts for months.
but, uh, her existing record's gonna be on the charts for months.
You don't want her competing against herself now, do you?
Who else do you want her competing with? I mean it's a win-win. To me.
I know what you mean, Sandy.
I have lots of ideas, but I can't tomorrow.
We've got publicist meetings.
-Publicists? What... what publicists? -Oh, yeah, just the top ones.
You know what? I'll send you the list, actually. You know what? Better yet, I'll e-mail you the list.
-What is that? -Oh, you're not familiar with e-mail?
E-mail? Of course I heard of that. Which one are you talking about?
You got your computer, right? And you plug that into your phone line...
...and you could send a document to another computer clear across the country
in a matter of minutes.
Who licks the envelope? R2-D2? I'm lost right now.
Now I think we're making a wrong move here.
I have a publicity campaign designed strictly for this woman right here.
You have a publicity campaign? Well, I mean, we're... The family's all here.
We would love to hear about it. What is it?
Well, I usually like my clients to start slow.
Keep it simple. Don't overexpose.
-Really, Sandy? [laughs] -Yes. Just gonna spit your chicken on my face? That's for you.
Okay. Maybe we'll hold off on the publicist thing.
Thank you.
But then we'll bring in one soon. -Okay, boys? -We'll talk about that.
Absolutely. I think that's smart.
All right. I'm gonna go check on these jeans.
-Okay? -Yes, my queen.
Your queen?
Sandy, you are the reason she needs a publicist.
I'm the reason?
You know how many calls I got after Quincy Jones threw you out of his party?
-Oh... She dared me to do it. -What are you, 14, Sandy?
No, I'm not 14. I'm not 14 at all.
Your job is to protect her. I protect her 24/7!
And how is that? By screwing up her shot on Arsenio?
We got the show, didn't we? Because I fixed it!
You fixed it. You did everything. You invented music.
What did you do, Sandy?
Did you file the paperwork for the Grammy nomination before the deadline?
Did you squash the story in the Enquirer
about her corrections officer father falling asleep during a prison riot?
Did you send envelopes of cash to the radio stations so they could play her record?
No, you didn't do that.
You know how I know you didn't do it, Sandy? Because I did it. I did all those things.
And what did you do? Hmm?
You made sure Gary, the daredevil trapeze artist,
was her opening act at the Universal Amphitheatre.
Gary is family.
This dude shattered his pelvis on an amplifier!
I was there. I saw.
There was blood all over the first three rows! -People were vomiting! -Yeah, all right.
That doesn't really segue well into soulful singer-songwriter now, does it, Sandy?
She got 'em back. She's too good to lose a crowd.
She's too good for you.
Sandy, she could have any manager she wants. She wants me!
And that is what's holding her back.
Look, Sandy, you did your job.
[imitating Sandy] You brought her up to the big leagues.
I'm telling you. Come on!
But now you're just... You're out of your depth.
Don't let your ego get in the way.
Can you look me in the eye and tell me you're doing what's best for her?
-[Courtney] Okay. -Ah!
Pants-Off Dance-Off is officially canceled.
-Put these bad boys on. -Okay.
You got the stain out? Very nice. Look at you. Look at you.
Well, I'm beat to shit. I'm gonna call it.
You're gonna call it? All right. I'll walk you out, then.
Thank you for everything. Appreciate it all.
Oh. Oh, yeah. Good night.
Thanks for scaring the stalker raccoon.
You don't have to thank me, Courtney. That's my pleasure.
Look, Sandy...
This rock star thing is new to me. I'm doing the best I can to make everybody happy, you know.
You make the world happy, Courtney. That's all you need to worry about.
Thank you, Sandy.
That's why it's difficult for me to tell you this.
But where you are right now in your career,
and what it requires of my time, it's...
I'm being kind of forced here to make sacrifices that,
with good conscience, I don't really wanna make.
Like what?
Like my stable of talent.
I can't give them what I believe each and every one of them deserves
if I'm worried about all the complexities of your day-to-day.
It's a lot, kid. I'm sorry.
So what? You don't want to work together anymore?
Well, it's just the current situation isn't fair to you, either.
I can't commit to you 100% if I got other things on my mind,
which unfortunately I do. The stable.
Sandy, let's not do this right now.
Let's take a minute and think it over.
I don't need a minute.
I promised your dad I'd always do what's best for you.
This is best.
So that's it?
You ever need me, just beep.
Sandy.
You're gonna be all right, Courtney.
You're gonna be a legend.
Brightest star out there.
Legend has it he stayed in that car and cried for... six hours?
Someone called child services 'cause they thought a little girl was in trouble.
-Yeah. -In a car.
I mean, not that anybody has a good cry,
but his cry sounded like some kind of, like, lonesome moose. [imitates moose calling]
Whatever the amount of time was that he cried, he broke his own rules. He just got too close.
he broke his own rules. He just got too close.
It was Alfred all over again.
That was a tough time...
'cause Sandy not only lost his most talented client ever,
but he also lost this person he had feelings for.
[woman] It must've been especially painful for Sandy, because Courtney Clarke was everywhere.
Whoo!
Gary Rodgers, ladies and gentlemen.
♪ There's something In the way that you talk to me ♪
Yo, man, your girl blew up. She the shit now.
-Congratulations, Sandy. -Yeah.
Yeah, she's doing great. Uh...
We're not working together anymore, though.
Oh. Now that makes sense.
[chuckles] Later, dawg.
Yeah. That makes sense.
It makes sense if I kill you, Arsenio.
That would make sense.
♪ I know it is destiny ♪
♪ Hot summer nights, lovers ♪
Get out of town with that.
♪ Samba dancing with Fire in their eyes burning ♪
Come on.

All right. That's enough.
Come on, already.
What have we got here?
[gasps] Sandy!
I was scared you wouldn't come.
Hey. Where's Peter? Is he doing PT?
[chuckles] Sandy, why don't you take off your shoes?
Take off my... Oh, for your rug?
You know, my shoes are actually cleaner -than my socks, but... -[laughs]
[Cindy] And here we are.
-Hey, hey. -And here's your throne.
Why don't you sit down, Sandy? [chuckles]
-Hey. -What would you like to drink?
You know, I got a bit of a sour stomach.
If you got Dr. Brown's black cherry diet, that would be perfect.
Or a big glass of whiskey. Either way is...
Oh, look.
Did you ever see that naughty little movie, 9½ Weeks?
No, I didn't.
I saw Problem Child, though. That kid was hysterical.
Well, not as funny as that. Look at you. [laughs]
-Peter's been sick for a long time. -Yeah.
And a woman yearns for a man's touch.
Hey, no, that's natural.
Are you a man, Sandy?
I don't know. I...
I was bar mitzvahed, but that was a long time ago.
-You know what I love about you? -Yeah?
-Your voice. -[laughs]
Come on. I've got a surprise.
-Come along. -Hey, what's this? -[stammers] Just sit here. Now, sit. -Oh! Oh, yeah.
-[stammers] Just sit here. Now, sit. -Oh! Oh, yeah.
Touch me, Sandy. Touch me.
Well, I... I was just walking on the carpet in my socks. -I don't wanna zap you. -Oh. You can zap me. Just zap me.
-I don't wanna zap you. -Oh. You can zap me. Just zap me.
Cindy!
Don't worry about Peter. He only wants my happiness.
Yeah.
[stammers] I can't do it. I can't.
-I'd feel better if we-- -Don't, Sandy, please. -Don't leave. Stay here. -Oh...
We... we could put a blanket over his head.
-That's... that's actually a thought. -[Peter groans]
No. He says no. He said... I'm sorry.
[stammers] I consider Peter a friend,
whether he's alive or dead or in a vegetative state.
Thanks for the offer, okay? -[static crackles] -[yells]
I got the shock! I knew I... The socks.
Pervert.
-[man 1] Cindy! -[man 2] Cindy!
[man 3] Madonna!
[man 4] Melissa!
-Wrapping up the CDs. -[Sandy laughs]
-Doing too good a job. I feel that... -[audience laughs]
Just... a little bit overzealous with the wrapping is my feeling.
-What is the security on this thing? -[laughing]
It's a $12 item.
They got it wrapped up like the Hope Diamond.
It's impossible that they have cellophane...
What are you doing? You look gloomy. Reiser's killing out there. Come on.
You're like a monkey with a coconut. You're just looking at it...
He's killing the jokes that I wrote. It should be me up there killing it.
Next year, it will be. CBS sees your jokes work now.
Next year, you'll be telling those jokes, 'cause you wrote 'em.
You want me to do the jokes he's telling right now on next year's Grammys?
But you do 'em in your voice.
But the punch lines are the same. People have heard them already.
You do new punch lines.
So then they're new... They're new jokes. No, but you're doing 'em in your voice.
I wanna strangle you. -Don't say "your voice" again. -What are you...
I'm gonna kill you if you say "in my voice."
-Would you stop? I can't ever-- -Sandy?
Courtney.
Look at you!
-Hey! Hey. -Hey! Oh.
You, uh, remember my, uh, client Paul Reiser?
-Kevin Connors. -Kevin!
They should have had you host this show.
Paul Reiser is usually funny, but his jokes tonight are just corny.
-You still doing Atkins? I see. -Atkins.
-You look great! -Thank you. Well, my God.
-I look good? Look at you. -You look so good!
I have been following you. You are doing so well.
The Grammy tonight. Did I tell you when that was gonna happen, huh?
You deserve it all. You really do.
You deserve it, too. I wouldn't be here without you.
Are you kidding me? You cannot stop a shooting star.
-Aw. -Our scientists have proven this.
You are unbelievable, Sandy.
How's Bling? Where is he?
Yeah, he's my label guy. He's not my guy-guy anymore.
-Well, I'm so sorry. That's-- -Don't be.
Things happen for a reason.
I scored us each a goodie bag, my sweet.
-Hi, cuteness. -Can I keep your PlayStation?
Yes.
Guys, this is my new boyfriend, Ra... Say it for me, babe.
Ramiro Alejandro.
Sandy Wexler. Nice to meet you, Ramir... [stammers]
-Ramiro Alejandro. -I know.
Oh, is this the old Make-A-Wish guy you were telling me about?
No. No, we used to work together.
Hey, you wanna come to Clive Davis' after-party? You could ride with us.
I, uh, would love to. -I, uh, have to go somewhere. -[Courtney] Aw.
A client of mine... Amy Baskin. You... you remember Amy.
Yeah!
Yes, well, she got the lead in Sound of Music at the Pasadena Playhouse.
-She'll be Partygoer Number One. -[laughs] Yeah, that's the lead.
It is. She's... she's the lead partygoer.
Let's get together real soon, Sandy. Promise me.
-I promise. You promise me this. -Of course. What?
-After Clive's party... -Mmm-hmm. -...you put on the ugly duckling hat... -Oh, gosh.
...and you remind yourself where you came from.
Not on this hair.
-Like we... Nope, not on your hair. -[man] Courtney...
-You promise? -...we have to go.
-I promise. Okay. -I gotta see you. Okay.
[Courtney] Good to see you, babe.
Nice meeting you, Sammy! Hope they find a cure for you, buddy.
Buddy, move. Move! -Get out the way! -Which way are you moving?
-Okay, go! -Sandy, move! Sandy!
That was another tough goodbye for Sandy.
He... he didn't even know if he would ever see or talk to Courtney again.
Of course he kept himself busy.
He actually signed someone who was involved in the biggest form of entertainment in the '90s.
Wrestling. Professional wrestling.
Go to sleep, baby! It's night-night time! [grunts]
-[man] You're the man, Bedtime. -Isn't he?
Oh, I know you're gonna take the title on Sunday. -I'm gonna make 'em go night-night. -[laughs]
-Thank you. -I'm gonna lose.
You don't know that. Hang on, please.
Yeah, I do know that. I got the script.
Tsunami sits on my face until I tap out. I'm never gonna be the champ.
Okay, look.
The good thing is, you're gonna have a grown man sit on your face
and the entire world is gonna be watching. That's a positive.
-That's not a positive. -It's a positive because it's... -The fame factor. -What?
Hey, Bedtime. Will you rock me like a baby while my brother Dicky gets a picture?
-What are you, six? -Yeah, of course he will.
-Of course he will do it. -Do you see the size of this guy?
Just get on it.
Oh. Hang on, guys. My cellular device is ringing.
And I hit this, and I pull this.
Wexler Artists.
Mr. Wexler, it is Chippy from Dan Tana's.
Chippy! Hey! How's it going? How was your vacation to Cincinnati?
It was, uh, not a vacation. My mother died. I went to Cincinnati for the funeral.
Oh, yeah. That's right. How's your mother?
What are you calling for?
We have a delicate situation with a client of yours who has had too much to drink.
And unfortunately, there are very many paparazzi out front.
Oh, boy. Was it Gary or Kevin?
[man] Yeah, I chased him for six or seven blocks.
Just come on. Get a life, guys. Jeez.
-Bring me to the package. -This way.
Courtney?
What the... What's going on, kiddo?
Sandy! They found you!
Yeah, they found me.
You just stay put, okay? You stay right there.
Aw, Sandy to the rescue.
No one can find out about this. You understand me, Chippy? Not even you.
[scoffs] Okay, Sandy.
-[grunts] Okay. -Sandy!
What? She'll suffocate? Is that what you're saying?
[all chanting] Courtney! Courtney! Courtney! [Sandy] Go jump in a lake, fellas!
Ah! No, no, no, no! Oh, come on! Oh, please, please, please.
Keep your voices down. Let her sleep.
That's right. Just sleep. Sleep, sleep.
Let me get this up for you.
And you... you're breathing.
Are you breathing?
Yeah, there it is. Okay.
You'll be all right.
[Sandy] I'm telling you, he's the best ventriloquist in the business. He...
[woman] You don't see him talking?
No, you see his lips move slightly, but that's not the important thing.
The important thing is what the guy is saying.
No one looks at the lips if they're laughing, then...
No, kids love him.
[stammers] That's why I'm bringing it up to you. The kids will love this guy.
He's got curly hair, and... and he's got the mustache.
I'm sorry.
-Linda, I'm... I'm just asking if you... -Do you want some breakfast?
-Sandy... -If you could just
put a good word in for me. That's it.
Maybe put his headshot on his desk.
-I really wish I could, Sandy. -Hey, just meat, right?
Oh, yeah. Hold on. Just meat.
Just meet with him. That's all I'm asking you to do. Just meet with him.
All right, Sandy.
Thank you, Linda! Thank you!
Happy birthday on Wednesday.
-How did you know that? -Yeah, 'cause I know.
'Cause I know. I know everything.
How good is this? Phenomenal.
No one knows how to cook health food like... You're fantastic. You can do it all.
I owe you for last night. I'm embarrassed.
Hey, everybody gets zonked once in a while.
The question is, why are we doing it?
I don't know. I...
I just broke up with Billy.
Billy? Who's Billy? What happened to the Marc Anthony fella?
Marc Anthony? Come on, Sandy.
Pick up a People magazine every once in a while.
That was three boyfriends ago.
Oh, hey, I gotta start writing some of these names down.
I'm getting lost. I'm joking around with you.
What you're doing's perfectly natural.
Anyone in your position would be doing the same. Look, Liza did it.
Elizabeth Taylor did it. Sherwood Schwartz did it.
[sighs] Just my life.
It feels out of control.
I can't connect with anybody. I don't... I just don't feel safe.
I can't even go ten feet
without the paparazzi following me, taking pictures of me, spying on me.
I don't even want to leave my house anymore. What? You gotta leave your house.
Even Michael Jackson leaves his house once in a while. How?
He just don't look like Michael Jackson.
Excuse me, sir. You know what time it is?
Can you do me a favor?
Courtney Clarke was just in there. Uh, could you find out where she went?
This is... Somebody just got their life back!
-[laughs] -Why do you own this stuff?
Why? Those are my workout clothes.
You work out? [laughs]
Suzanne Somers personally gave me one of the very first ThighMasters. I use it as much as I can.
This conversation is over.
What? It's for firm thighs and buttocks.
-Sandy, please stop talking. -All right.
What we gonna do today? What we gonna do today? Anything you want, kiddo.
-Okay, lead the way, ThighMaster. -Hey! Now, wait a minute.
-By the way, the dogs are good for cardio. -Oh.
What does that mean? -You'll see. -[dogs barking]
-[Sandy] Go! Run! Run! Run! -Okay! Okay!
[Sandy] Well, here comes the test.
Look at that. Look at that. Huh?
Why am I golfing?
Golfing is very relaxing.
You don't have to think about nothing but smacking that ball.
Have you ever played before?
-No. -No? It's quite easy.
I'll take out the big stick 'cause it's fun to hit 'em far.
It's always good to warm up a little bit. Ow! Okay.
I got actually a little problem in the back.
-You okay? -Yeah. Just give me one sec.
God damn it.
-Should I call for help? -No, I'll be all right.
Just give me one sec. I just gotta stretch.
All right. Just give me one more sec. I do need help.
You need to go to the bathroom? No, I'm just... I'm getting it lined up.
Let's just say goodbye to all our troubles, okay?
Okay.
If you got any problems, put 'em into the ball and send them away.
Is it supposed to curve off to the right like that?
Yeah, I was playing a dogleg right. -A dogleg? -Right.
You gotta bend it around the trees, and that's what I was going for.
-Can I try it? -You wanna try? Okay.
I was gonna show you a little more, but okay.
-Okay. -So let me...
You know, maybe you should tee it up for yourself. Tee it up. Here.
-You tee it up, and you say goodbye. -Right here.
Okay.
And just have a good time and don't worry about where it goes.
-Let's see. -Okay.
Am I being hustled right now? What was that?
I swear I didn't play every day growing up with my Uncle Davey who's a golf pro.
-Oh, well... -[Courtney laughs]
Does this guy need a manager because...
-Come over here. -What are we doing?
We gotta work on that slice leg. -Oh, my God. -Here you go. Here you go.
-This is your day. I don't want to... -No. No, no, no. You got it?
-You're okay with it? [laughs] -Oh, it's my day now. Come on.
-In the hips. -In the hips.
Here we go.
Oh! All right! Hold on now. [laughs]
Huh? I beg your pardon?
[Sandy] Tell me. Tell me. [Courtney] A company called Pixar...
-[Sandy] Pixar? -...wants me to do a voice in some animated movie about a bunch of toys.
[Sandy] Cartoons are dead. -Tell 'em pass. -[Courtney chuckles]
-Okay. Sandy knows best. -I mean, come on. I do know best.
The lady at Chili's said they'll keep it open till 10:30 for us, so that's good.
How you feeling anyway?
As good as anybody can feel knowing they're about to get their face sat on by that guy.
Damn, that's a big ass!
-That's right-- -Get off me!
Listen. Will you just trust me? This is a good night for you.
Trust you? It's humiliating. My kids are out there, man! My wife might not ever kiss me again!
Randy Savage had to get whooped 24 times
before he finally pinned Ted DiBiase to win the belt, man!
How does your platinum-selling ass know about wrestling history?
I'm from Alaska. It was either watch wrestling or fish.
Is that adorable?
Will you just take it all in and promise me you'll have fun?
This is a big night for you. Look at me.
Man, how does your goofy ass have me feeling good right now? That's impossible!
Because you know I love ya and I'm your family.
All right, good luck.
Get out there!
Yeah! Come on!
-[referee] Fight! -[bell ringing]
Okay.
No!
Break, break, break, break!
Hey, what are you doing? Stick to the script.
I'm sorry, Tsunami. You're gonna have to earn this one. What? Hey...
This is bullshit. I'm supposed to win.
This happening? Huh, this is happening?
Well, bring it on!
Okay, get back there, champ!
There it is. Now it's getting real.
Thank you very much!
What is this?
No, you're not! What's going on here?
Say it!
It's time to go night-night!
-I got the belt! I'm the champ! [laughs] -[man] You the man! You the man!
-Sandy! How? -What do you... Huh?
The referee is a client, and Wexler Artists look out for each other.
Oh, man! Those guys are gonna fire his ass!
Of course they are,
but I already got him a job as a referee for the Harlem Globetrotters.
-I know. I understand. -You're never going to work again!
What do you say, champ? Proud of ya.
Oh! I'm so happy, Sandy!
I love you. This is your moment. This is all you.
I'm just so happy for you and your wife and your kids.
Okay? That's all I want.
-I love you! I love you! -You deserve everything!
-Courtney, get in here! -You deserve everything!
Uh, we do have to go to Chili's, though. I told the lady we'd be there by 10:30, so let's get going.
-Why are you talking about Chili's now? -I just don't wanna...
I don't want her to screw us for the next time, you know. Let's go.
[Sandy] Eat up those baby backs, guys.
How do you take care of everybody and never worry about yourself?
How do you become Sandy?
Oh, well, listen.
How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, practice, practice.
I wish I could stay here.
This is the best day I've had in years.
Listen, you can stay as long as you want.
I'm supposed to go to New York tomorrow
and shoot this VH1 thing with Lenny Kravitz.
Yeah?
That's a good thing.
Is it?
Then why don't I wanna go?
Tell me I don't have to go, Sandy.
No, no, no.
Why won't you?
'Cause that's not my job anymore.
Okay.
What do you want me to do?
What I want you to do is concentrate on your career.
Music comes first.
Go to New York.
-You know what? [scoffs] -What?
You're a jerk.
[Firuz] Oh, God, yes!
What was that?
-Firuz! -Oh, all right, then.
I'll go take a walk or something.
Have the best night of your life, Sandy.
I'm trying.
Ultimately, I have to move.
[Courtney] The day was perfect, the night was better.
Thank you. I'm off to New York.
Sandy knows best.
Love, Court.
-Pick that up! -Shut up, Firuz!
Just shut up.
Success can be really lonely.
That's why you kinda long for someone to share it with.
So a week later, her and Lenny Kravitz moved in together.
And then two weeks later after that, moved out.
And she moved on to Johnny Depp.
-Chris Cornell. -George Clooney.
-Ziggy Marley. -Pauly Shore.
I went out with her?
Man, Sandy was messed up.
[man] Sir, are you committing suicide? 'Cause I don't think I'm allowed to film that!
No, I'm not!
I'm fine, thank you very much!
She can date whoever she wants to date! That's her thing!
-He's talking to me. -He's talking to you?
Sandy, that pool looks far away. How long until my skin starts burning?
I think the safety advisor said four seconds you get
before you must be wet.
You think he said that or he said that? Four?
I got to admit, I haven't been sleeping. I'm just so tired.
I don't care. I'm about to be lit on fire! He said it! He said what he said.
Okay, here we go. Right calf first.
Okay. Okay.
-Okay! [yelling] -Okay, go, go, go!
-[bat chirping] -What? Oh!
[groans] No!
No! [groans]
Okay. So birds sleep at night, but the bats wake up.
-Okay. -[Gary groaning loudly]
Now we know. Now we know. No, this is a good thing.
I'm telling you, Bud, he can follow anybody.
He can follow... He followed Minnie at The Ice House recently.
I know you don't like The Ice House. I don't know why I said that. I'm sorry.
All right, I'm gonna go watch Kevin.
-Hey, Sandy. -Kirby.
You got a minute? Yeah, I'm going to watch my client on stage.
Actually, Kevin and I think it's time for a change.
He's dumping me through you? You gotta admit, you've been a bit clingy. I'm telling ya.
You're telling me? I'm telling you. So we agree.
Bud, Alex, how are you guys? Good to see you.
It's all happening here tonight, isn't it?
♪ You give me butterfly, butterflies ♪
♪ Down in my soul ♪
♪ Butterflies, butterfly ♪
Why the hell do you have me singing that song? -They hated it! -No.
This is an awful idea, Sandy!
No, I... I'm telling you, you did better than you think!
-You are out of your mind! -No! No!
-I'm sorry. -No, don't.
-It's time you go night-night. -No night-night! No!
-You're fired. -Oh, God! Come on!
No! You can't do that to me! Aah!
We're done, Sandy. We're done! Don't say that.
[narrator on TV] Your life is an adventure. You don't want to miss a single moment.
-[Sandy] This girl's the new Grace Kelly. -Now, you don't have to.
Vag-Eze, America's number one vaginal discharge ointment.
Side effects include dryness, burning, itching, fallopian tube--
-What's vaginal discharge? -Can I have some?
You said it was a coffee commercial, Sandy!
What the hell is going on here?
Please, God, I need a miracle.
[Mr. Buttons] "Remember, kids, if you laugh when you are blue,
the sun... [sniffles] ...will always shine on you.
Mr. Buttons."
Teddy!
Wonderful news. Mr. Buttons is dead!
You killed him?
[laughs] No! He hung himself!
-Really? -His time slot's open, guys.
I got you the audition.
It doesn't feel right. I mean, I feel bad for the guy.
Screw Mr. Buttons! It's our turn!
-He couldn't take the pressure. -He took the coward's way out.
I gotta tell you, it's the first time I... I agree with the puppets.
Friend Boom Boom is gonna sing a song for us today, kids. Would you like that? Would you like to hear it?
I hate singing.
What are you talking about? You sing all the time.
You sing in the car, you sing in the shower...
You spy on me in the shower?
-That is not what I meant. -I can sing, Ted.
-Would you like to hear that, kids? -[children] Yeah!
You have something in your throat, Heather? Yeah, your hand, dummy!
I can't believe it. These kids are eating your boy up! I mean, he could be the next Buttons.
-Didn't I tell you? Didn't I say? -Yeah, great.
Hey! There's a caterpillar on your face.
What's with you? What, are you okay?
-No, no, I, uh... -Something wrong? There's something wrong?
Maybe a little dizzy. I had too many bacon bits this morning.
Bacon Bits? What is that? That's a dog food, no?
No. Didn't say that on the box.
Yeah, all right, whatever. Tell you what, you come to my office in an hour.
We'll hammer out a deal.
I'll get your boy on the air ASAP. Okay, bud?
All righty. That makes me very happy.
-[Sandy] They absolutely loved you. -[Ted laughing]
-You're getting the job, Teddy. -I did good. I did good.
My only fear is they're gonna try to lowball you on the deal, all right?
The key to this meeting is tough talk.
These TV jerks only respond to bullying and aggression.
Well, I'll let you handle all that, okay? [chuckles]
I'm no doctor, but Sandy look like crap on a stick.
No, I'm fine.
-Sandy! -[Sandy] No.
[Heather] I think he's having a heart attack.
We... we gotta get you to a hospital. Boom Boom, call an ambulance!
No, Boom Boom. First meeting, close deal, then hop-ital.
Forget the meeting. You can barely speak.
But... you can.
[Marty] So what we saw in there told us everything we need to know.
We love Ted. The kids love Ted.
-That is... That's spectacular. -[clapping] Thank you. Thank you so much.
But the fact is he's never been on television.
So here's the deal.
Six episodes, 15 grand a pop, and then we see what we do from there.
[imitating Sandy] Are you kidding me, Marty?
-What? -You think I'm a complete a-hole?
No, no, no.
Then why are you treating me like one?
I think it's a reasonable starting place, Sandy.
Reasonable, Fishbein? It's dog crap.
If we take this deal,
my guy's gonna end up at the end of a rope just like your last clown.
-Whoa, man! -All right. Sandy, Sandy. Take it easy.
Take it easy. Just make us a counter.
We want a two year... Five year deal.
Sandy, please.
Twenty-four show minimum, 50 grand an episode,
with a 200K bump every year we're on the air.
This guy's an animal.
He's literally foaming at the mouth.
And the puppets get their own dressing rooms.
Just kidding.
Okay.
Three years, 20 show minimum, at the numbers you mentioned.
Deal.
Ted, welcome to the UPN family.
And that's how Sandy died. On the conference room floor at UPN.
Just kidding. They took him to the hospital.
Where am I?
You had a minor heart attack. A warning shot.
Probably due to stress. And meat.
Just need to rest for a few days. Here you go.
This is too nice of a room for me. I can't afford this.
Come on, man. I wasn't gonna let you slum it down in the regular people ward.
First class all the way for my Sandman.
-You came! -Of course.
Miss Clarke, I love your new album.
I play it every day. I'm obsessed with it. Thank you.
-You're so beautiful. -Thank you. -Can I touch you? -[Sandy laughs]
Oh, I... I... I just touched the queen! [laughs]
Oh, and you, sir, you need a new bedpan, so I'm gonna grab that for you.
-I used the bedpan while I was sleeping? -Thanks.
You did a new album?
Oh. Don't you worry about that. I want you to worry about getting better.
It's scary, knowing your heart's not good.
Sandy Wexler, you have the biggest, best, strongest heart
in this whole miserable town. And that's a fact.
Miserable town?
It's been quite nice to you, thank you very much.
[scoffs] I guess.
I just feel like I need a change, you know?
So I'm moving to Seattle.
Seattle? What are you talking about?
That whole grunge thing, that's old hat. Why would you go there?
The guy I'm marrying lives there.
You're getting married?
Yeah.
Saturday, in Malibu.
His name is Eric Lamonsoff. He's not in show business.
He owns a chain of coffee stores.
A store that just sells coffee? I don't know.
That ain't gonna work, kid.
I just need a... a break from the music.
But singing's the only thing that makes you happy.
Yeah, but I'm looking for something else to make me happy.
'Cause that's not it anymore.
Miss Clarke, I'm so sorry to bother you, but would you?
Sure.
Is that the record? Can you play it?
-Is there a player in the room? -Yeah.
I gotta hear this.
You were always there for me.
Even when you weren't.
Goodbye, Sandy.

I love this song.
This guy's butchering it.
Alfred?
Wow. Nobody's called me that in years.
Good to see you, Sandy.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Well, this is where I get all my best ideas.
Well, here and the radio.
Yeah, you... you've been on such a roll.
From "My Bologna" to "Pretty Fly for a Rabbi."
Just great. Clever stuff.
Oh, thanks, man. Well, you know, you're the one who put it all together.
-[laughs] -Remember what you told me?
-Stick with the accordion. -Uh-huh.
Only wear Hawaiian shirts.
Do funny words to other people's songs.
-Genius. -Huh?
I'm glad. I'm glad it all worked out for you. I really am. Sincerely.
Thank you, man. Well, I'm just sorry that we couldn't have done it together.
Hey, listen. I got too close.
Our friendship was getting in the way of our business. You did what you had to do.
Wait a minute. Is that what you think happened?
That is what happened.
-You thought we got too close? -Yeah.
No, Sandy. [stammers] That's not why I left you.
I left you because you could never tell me the truth.
What? That's ridiculous!
Tell me one time I didn't tell you the truth.
You told me we could copyright the word "weird."
No, I said it was weird that we couldn't copyright it.
You... Come on. You were hearing what you want to hear.
Sandy, you tell people what you think they want to hear.
-I don't agree. -No, look. [stammers]
For me, if you really care about someone, you tell 'em the truth.
You're right, Alfred.
Damn it, you're 100% right.
-Your hair looks good, by the way. -Thanks, man, I...
-You're lying again. -I am. It looks like dirty spaghetti.
I gotta stop. I'm gonna stop!
-I'm gonna stop, Alfred. -You should.
Hey! Hey! You suck!
You know what? Real funny, Weird Al.
Why don't you make me laugh one time without using somebody else's music?
Get off of me.
[Sandy] I'd like to book a space for a private event.
No! No! Don't tell me it's impossible! Everything's negotiable!
Put it on your calendar, Ted. Okay? Don't be late.
I think we'll be busy.
-I'm not talking to you. -Hey! I'm talking to Ted!
-Okay. We'll be there. -What's his problem?
I don't know. Just do what he says.
It's an international call, so talk fast, okay?
Can I count on you?
Perfect. And you have a valid driver's license?
How am I looking?
You actually look good, Sandy.
[yells] That surprises you?
-Courtney, your limo is here. -It's showtime, girl.
Wow. Um, it's early. I'll be right down, guys.
It's a big day, Miss Courtney Clarke.
The biggest.
-You look very beautiful. -Thanks.
How is traffic out there?
Traffic's not a problem. You sit back, relax.
Let Firuz take good care of you.
Sir, I think you missed our turn.
No, no, no, no.
That was a thing that on purpose I did.
We're going shortcut.
What are we doing here?
Please, miss, go inside.
I'm going inside to call the police.
Sandy?
Just you and me under the stars again, kid.
-Yeah, but now's not exactly a good time. -I know.
And I have no right to say to you what I'm gonna say, but I'm gonna do it anyway.
You like making trouble, don't you, Sandy?
Look, here's the thing.
Maybe sometimes I got a way of telling people what I think they want to hear,
rather than what I'm really thinking.
So I was thinking, if I started saying the stuff that I think,
maybe I'm gonna find out that's actually what the people wanted to hear.
Oh, shit, Sandy. You mixed up your pills.
What I'm trying to say is this Eric Lamonsoff guy is wrong for you.
Just like Bling was the wrong guy and Lenny Kravitz.
Marc Anthony. And Prince. And Apollonia.
Dennis Rodman, who's great on the boards, but...
You dated Dennis Rodman? Good Lord.
Dad, what are you doing here?
Sandy's gettin' to that part. You just listen.
Yeah, thank you, Willy.
All right, here's the deal.
All those guys were chasing you because you're incredible.
But none of them really know who you are.
Who am I, Sandy?
You're Courtney Clarke.
The beautiful swan from Magic Mountain.
Now, I wouldn't tell you to break a deal unless I thought there was a better offer out there for you.
-Is there a better offer? -Oh, absolutely.
There's an aggressive offer out there.
There's a guy who's willing to be devoted to you 100% for your entire life.
A guy who will make all the tough phone calls, fight all the big fights.
A guy who will never doubt you.
Even when you doubt yourself.
Keep going.
He has surprisingly muscular quads due to the ThighMaster.
But what does this guy want in return?
All he wants in return is for you to be you,
just the way you are, because he loves you.
I love you.
I've always loved you.
You're my star, Courtney.
I love you, too, Sandy.
I should have told you the truth so long ago.
Listen, I dye my hair.
And I also apologize to my clothes if I don't wear 'em enough.
-No more truth. -Absolutely.
Just kiss me.
Save that kiss. I came all the way down here for a wedding.
-Let's get to it. -Yeah, let's not get him mad.
Yeah, you're right.
Boom Boom is ordained as an interdenominational minister.
Or we also have...
[clears throat] Hey. Shalom.
There he is.
What do you say, kid?
Will you marry me?
You had me at "shalom."
♪ I prefer you to remain a Christian ♪
No, no, no. That's fine. Either way, I'm good.
Meanwhile, Eric Lamonsoff was across town waiting at the altar.
And don't feel sorry for him. That whole coffee thing worked out just great.
Plus, he ended up marrying Downtown Julie Brown.
-Honey? -What? -You got a little schmutz, right there. -Thank you. Thank you.
Something had clicked with Sandy.
And he started reaching out one by one to his old clients.
And because he started telling them the truth... most of them ended up having pretty big careers.
-I signed with him. -I signed with him.
-I signed with him. -We signed with him.
And of course, I went back to Sandy. He's my manager and my best friend again.
Too bad a wedding officiated by a puppet was not legal.
Which is why, 20 years later, they're finally making it real.
-[man] There he is! -Yeah! How y'all doing? [laughs]
Show business wealth is good, but it's not real wealth.
-It's not-- -Hey, shot, man?
-Let's do a shot? Oh, all right. -I'm good. I'm good.
-Hey! -Oh, my God! Hi!
I'm sorry, what?
I'm sorry, man. I can't understand a word you're saying.
No, seriously, I got nothing.
All right. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hi, guys.
Oh, thank you, Sandy. All these years in the business, he's got me working a wedding.
This is fantastic. He booked me in a tent, really is what it is.
Said if I do good here, I get a yurt next year.
No, um... that was, uh, some ceremony, too.
It was a... It was a little awkward, the priest and the rabbi together. That's always a...
The rabbi, he was, like, Googling, "Who's Jesus Christ?"
But that's okay.
Uh, what else is going on?
-Just bring out the couple already. -Yeah, quit doing your act.
-You're right. Okay. -[applause]
Please welcome, for the first time ever, Mr. and Mrs. Sandy and Courtney Wexler.
Dad. Bye.
-Sing! Sing! -Do it, girl!
Hey, hey, it could be worse. He could be eating.

Yeah, every time I ran into Sandy, he used to say, "I got to meet this Beavis kid.
Yeah, I want to represent him."
He didn't understand that that's a cartoon character.
You can't really manage a cartoon character.
And, uh, he did give me his number though,
and, uh, we used to call him in the middle of the night.
[Sandy, groggy] Wexler Artists.
[Beavis] Is this Sandy?
Yeah. Yeah, who... who is this? [chuckles] You know who this is.
[chuckles] You know who this is.
No, I don't. That's why I'm asking.
[chuckles] Guess.
Are you Gary Busey?
[chuckles] No way! Dumbass.
[stammers] Who? Beavis?
-You suck! -What? No, I don't.
You suck balls.
No, no, no, no.
You don't sound so good.
Now, tell me where you are and I'll pick you up.
[stammers] I'm in your butt.
What? What's this?
Yeah, I'm in there right now. [chuckles]
Hemorrhoids.
Wait. You get out of my butt. Get out right now.
Kill yourself.
Okay. Okay, that's it. I'm hanging up the phone.
[Sandy] Wexler Artists.
[Butt-Head] Uh... Sandy Wexler?
[Sandy] Who is this?
[Sandy stammers] Oh, hi, Butt-Head.
[Butt-Head] Uh, Sandy, I'm calling about Beavis.
[Sandy] Uh, yeah. Beavis wasn't too courteous last night, Butt-Head.
[Butt-Head] Uh, that's why I'm calling.
[Butt-Head] Uh, Beavis wanted to say he's sorry. [Sandy] Oh, okay. He is, huh? He... he's sorry?
[Butt-Head] Yeah. Beavis says he's sorry you're such a dumbass.
[Sandy] What? What's that? What? What'd you say?
[Butt-Head] Uh, and he's also sorry
that he said your face looks like a toilet and your balls smell funny.
[Sandy] Okay, okay. Well, you tell him I accept.
Look, you're good kids, and I like what you're doing.
I think if you want to get to the next level, you're gonna--
-[Butt-Head] Uh, hang on a second. -[Sandy] Okay.
[Butt-Head] Beavis wants to say something, sir. -[Sandy] Oh, okay. -[Beavis] Hey, this is Beavis.
-[Sandy] Oh, okay. -[Beavis] Hey, this is Beavis.
[Sandy] Uh... oh, hi, Beavis.
-[Beavis] Sandy Wexler? -Yeah.
[Beavis chuckles] Sandy Wexler?
-[Sandy] Yeah, I know my name. -[Beavis] Of Wexler Fartists?
[Sandy] All right. Okay, come on, guys.
[Butt-Head chuckles] Uh... You said you wanna come on guys?
[Sandy] That's it. I'm getting off.
[Beavis chuckling] You said you're getting off.
[Sandy] All right. Listen, you sons of bitches.
I'll find your parents and make you wish you never messed with the king of Hollywood.
You said "wood."
-All right. Come on! -[chuckling]
Stop it!
[Elle Evans] Look at that cute baby! That's me, Elle Evans.
And the smelly, less-cute baby right next to me? That's my best friend Lee.
Lee and I were born on the same day, at the same time,
here in Los Angeles, California.
Our moms were BFFs before people even used the term "BFF,"
so we were raised like twins
and we've been pretty much inseparable ever since.
I don't remember a lot from before high school,
but for as long as I can remember,
Lee and I have absolutely
loved to dance.
Anyway a lot of stuff has happened between now and then.
Let me get you up to speed. First Christmas I remember, I was six.
I got a Barbie dance party. Lee got a scooter.
Broke my leg riding Lee's scooter.
Had my cast signed by Lee, who bought me ice cream to make up for breaking my leg.
Dressed as a cowboy for Halloween, Lee went as a doctor.
Learned how to ride a bike, learned how to swim.
Got protected by Lee's older brother Noah,
who chased off some bullies who were hassling us.
Had to pay protection tax, though.
Discovered the place that we loved to dance most.
[Elle] Watched Lee catch his first fish.
Watched Noah in his first fight. He won.
Dressed as a fireman for Halloween.
Lee went as some weird bird.
Found out that my mom was sick.
Went to visit her in the hospital for the first time.
Tried to get used to seeing her there.
Got in a fight with Lee over who's the best dancer.
Made up by getting him ice cream.
Got in a fight with Noah for beating up Lee.
Made up with Noah by letting him fix my bike.
He is so handy!
Got my first bra. Didn't really need it.
Discovered I like soccer.
Discovered a way to get to our favorite place to dance.
Discovered that I wasn't gonna be a fashion icon.
Discovered I am good at sports.
Had a tough talk with Dad.
Sat with mom in the hospital.
I tried to help her put makeup on. Not much help.
Hey...
[Elle] Held her hand a long time.
Only cried when she was asleep.
Tried to score  my first kiss with Randy Melrose.
Wasn't exactly a love connection.
Watched Noah getting really, really cute!
Watched Noah in yet another fight. He won.
Got my period! Finally!
Went as a pirate for Halloween.
Lee was the Black Swan.
Said goodbye to my mom.
Had a lot to say.
Told her all about Noah.
Watched Noah ride his motorcycle for the first time.
Watched Lee try to ride Noah's motorcycle.
Watched Noah teach Lee a lesson for sitting on his motorcycle.
Celebrated with Lee when he got his dream car.
Learned that girls can be really mean.
Played Seven Minutes in Heaven. Fail!
Got a bra I suddenly did need!
Wondered why I still hadn't been kissed yet or even been on a date.
No big deal, I guess.
Realized I had a crush on Noah.
Got over my crush on Noah...
mostly.
Well...
I think that's about it.
And that's me today,
savoring the last fleeting moments of summer at Lee's totally awesome house.
It's moments like this that make me wish things could stay this way forever.
Ew! Perv!
Hey, Lee, guess what Warren texted the entire school!
Lee?
-Lee? -Geronimo!
Oh, no.
Oh, my God! That was a good one!
That was a good one!
Here, come here, take a seat.
So, tomorrow, first day of school,
the student council is expecting our dance club idea
this week for the fall fundraiser.
We're gonna be in trouble if we don't come up with something fast.
Yeah.
[Elle] I know what you're thinking.
Noah Flynn is stupid hot,
but Lee and I developed a list of friendship rules.
Lee was responsible for Rule Number Nine,
are totally off-limits."
This is a really big one for Lee.
I guess it comes from living in the shadow of a high school legend.
Lee, you seen my athletic cup?
Yes, asshat.
I needed it for all those varsity sports I'm constantly playing, you know?
Hey, Shelly.
[Elle] He knows I hate being called Shelly.
Yes, Noah?
I know he hates being called Noah.
When did you get the boobs?
When you were at football camp learning to be a better douche.
It was almost like she was on human growth hormones or something.
Lee! Rule Number Two, please!
Rule Number Two: Never share our secrets with anyone else.
Whatever. Listen. M and D are out of town Friday night,so party starts at eight.
Don't invite any jackasses.
Does that include you?
[Lee] What an ass!
I know!
Hey, hey, hey! Rule Number Nine, young lady!
Oh, come on!
[Elle] As if!
Yeah, well, you got a little bit of drool on the corner of your mouth.
-Right here? Oh, do I? -Yeah.
-Do I really? -You do.
Oh, no! Are you kidding me?
-Oh, my God! -[horn honking]
Hey, Dad, where are my other pairs of school pants?
[Dad] They're at the cleaners.
Come on!
Ninth grade skirt on eleventh grade body.
Perfect!
Okay.
Good morning!
-Morning. -Morning.
Elle...
Dad, my pants ripped. This is literally all I had.
I swear. I promise.
Okay, I suppose I could swing by the cleaners,
drop them off at school.
Really?
Oh, my God, that would be amazing!
-Thank you! -[honking continues]
Bye! I love you!
-I love you more! -Bye! I love you!
Don't say anything!
Okay? My pants ripped.
-You should have back-ups. -My backups are at the cleaners.
-What about your back-up back-ups? -These are my back-up back-ups!
-Okay, okay! -Come on, let's go!
Okay, I'm trying. Seriously though, cover up.
-Like, I'm trying to drive. -[Elle] Stop! You're so stupid!
Nice landing, ace!
Well, if you got your driver's license,
you wouldn't have to put up with my driving.
Okay, but why would I do that when I have you as my personal chauffeur?
True.
Oh! And today,
fundraiser ideas.
-Fine. -Thank you!
Hey, man, is that girl new?
Jeez, guys! Check out that.
Oh, my word!
Yo! I think that's Elle Evans!
Everybody's looking at us.
Allow me to revise. Everyone is looking at you.
-Damn! -What? No, they're not!
Elle, you are aware that your lady shape sort of changed over the summer, right?
[Elle] It was true.
This was the moment that happens to all of us
when you suddenly go from invisible to everyone staring at you.
-What the hell, Tuppen? -It's fine, Lee. I got this.
Relax, tiny Flynn.
How about I relax your face?
Lee, it's fine! I got this! Lee!
I did not think that through.
No, no, no!
Noah!
Noah, stop!
Enough, Noah! Stop! Are you crazy?
Knock it off!
Knock it off!
Now you three, in my office!
-Me? -Now!
Everyone, homeroom! Now!
Douchebag!
He even gets credit for my fights!
Why did you do that?
Lee was in trouble.
Any excuse for a fight, right?
I don't start fights, okay? I only finish them.
And besides, no one should treat a girl like that.
Especially if that girl is you.
Me?
Yeah. It's like those guys are trying to get in my little sister's pants,
which is super gross.
[Elle] Never great to hear your childhood crush say it's super gross in your pants.
You know, you have zero experience with guys.
You've never even had a boyfriend.
Whatever!
Wearing a skirt like that is asking for it.
Seriously?
You want to go down that road?
No.
I kind of just played the whole sexist conversation out in my head
and it always ended with me sounding like a dick.
Miss Evans.
First off,
that skirt is ridiculous.
-My pants ripped! It's all I had. -What about your back-ups?
-Dry cleaners. -Your back-up back-ups?
-These are my back-up back-ups! -All right! Don't get so upset!
I am upset. Dude touched my lady-bump.
And Mr. Tuppen will be punished,
but I also, unfortunately, must punish you.
-Oh, my God! Am I being expelled? -Elle...
I've never been in trouble before. I feel like it's hot in here. I'm sweating.
-Elle! -What?
You only broke the dress code.
That's all.
Detention tomorrow.
Oh, my God!
How crazy was that fight?
Flynn was so savage!
Have you made out with him yet?
[Elle] These three super-popular juniors are kind of package deal.
I call them the OMG Girls.
Olivia, Mia, and Gwyneth.
And I have no idea why they're sitting with me.
Oh, my God.
I would totally have babies with Noah.
One girl, one boy.
But not at the same time though.
Yeah, you don't really get to pick the gender so much.
I hear he's into blondes. Too bad, Elle.
Give me your numerals. We should def catch up.
-Okay, yeah! It's 310... -[phone dings]
Oh, my God.
Got to go, Elle.
There's a shemergency in the locker room.
Oh, okay.
Sorry it didn't work out with you and Noah.
Guess it wasn't meant to be.
[Elle] What just happened? And why were the OMG Girls being so nice to me?
But more importantly, when did they eat those?
-Was that Mia? -Did you see that?
She say anything about me? You tell her about my dimples?
What did she smell like today?
Sometimes she smells like apples or kind of like blueberry-coconut fusion.
What?
[Lee] What are you doing anyway?
I am trying to find a good idea for our carnival fundraiser.
Somebody has to.
-Come on. -[sighs]
What about the strength game, the one with the sledgehammer and the bell?
Yeah, the chess team picked that one. I know.
[Lee] What about... Ooh! What about a dunking booth?
-Swimming team picked it. -[Lee] Damn it!
I know, dude! Who saw that one coming?
Okay, do you think Mia would like this one?
Because I think it makes my eyes pop, and I really want to kiss her on Friday.
Come on! Today was the first time the OMGs ever spoke to me.
Do you really think Mia knows who you are?
Baby steps, Elle. Baby steps.
Lee, come on. She's a varsity cheerleader.
Basically, the only way she'd ever make out with you is if you paid for it.
-Kissing booth! -Kissing booth!
Oh, that is the perfect carnival fundraiser!
Yes! Oh, also,
I love the irony. The girl who's never been kissed does a kissing booth? What?
Yes, irony is a cruel mistress indeed.
Okay, well, now all we need is the student council to approve it.
Yes. Don't worry. Leave that to me.
Okay. Wait.
What about this one?
Mia will love it.
-Really? -No, dude! It's awful!
Dammit!
♪ Oh Mickey you're so fine You're so fine you blow my mind... ♪ Yearbook!
I can't believe you actually gave him your number.
Well, it was a really nice apology.
Plus, that whole skirt thing was priceless!
If word gets out that fighting me is a way of getting your number,
I am in for a super long junior year.
Oh, I wouldn't really call it a fight.
I think I'm gonna go out with Tuppen.
-Unless you think I shouldn't. -No, actually, I think you should.
You're gonna have to go on a date eventually.
-Right? -You know?
[Elle] So? God, what do people even do on dates?
I don't know. Sit around and eat food, I guess.
All right!
Okay.
My heart is beating so fast.
That is just fine.
Okay, listen. Can you just keep your phone on you?
Because I know myself and I'm gonna run out of things to talk about
-and I really want to call you-- -No.
-I know myself. -No! Do not call me.
Okay? If he can't see how completely baller you are,
Then he's not the right guy for you.
Oh! You can be so sweet when you want to be.
Oh, I know!
Kill it.
-Okay, thank you for driving me. -Totally.
-Love you. Bye! -Love you.
[Lee] Have a good time! But not too good of a time!
[Elle] God! What is wrong with me?
Is my butt too big?
Am I some sort of freak or something?
No! You're awesome, all right?
Tuppen is just a dick. I don't know why I told you to go out with him.
Maybe because he's the only guy that's ever asked me out.
Stop it, all right? Tuppen isn't worth it.
You're way too good for him.
Plus I heard he's got like, three nipples.
[Lee] Just saying.
Thanks for doing this for me.
Are you kidding me? I live for this shit.
Alrighty. Hit the road.
You had your shot. Keep on moving, bud.
I need to talk to Elle.
Lee, it's okay.
[Elle] So,
running a bit late now, are we?
Look. I'm sorry I stood you up.
I really did want to go out with you.
I just thought you deserve a little bit of an explanation.
That would be nice.
Flynn...
told me that it wouldn't be smart if I showed up for our date tonight.
Noah?
Yeah.
That literally makes no sense.
It's true, and it's not just me.
He's been going around telling all the guys not to ask you out
for a while now.
What?
Shit.
There's others?
You can't tell him I told you.
Why do you care?
No boobs are worth a broken nose.
Fine!
I got to go.
Go! Whatever!
Leave!
But just so you know, my boobs are fantastic!
Yes, some would even say breathtaking!
Shit.
You do realize that you're not my dad, right?
Look, you still got a lot to learn, kiddo.
Kiddo? Oh, my God.
Oh, if you were here, I would beat you with my shoe,
Tuppen is a player.
So are you!
And that's why I know he's wrong for you.
-You're gonna thank me one day. -Okay.
Well, today is not that day.
It is not your job to monitor my dating life. Do you understand me?
The days of you controlling my life are over!
We'll see about that.
[British Beauty] Next proposal is from the dance club.
Elle Evans and Lee Flynn.
[British accent] You have an accent.
Sorry. I thought that was gonna be funnier.
And what is your idea for the fundraiser?
Sorry.
[Elle] Okay.
We have an idea that we think everyone will be very excited about.
But first, we want to thank you for your time
and ask that you withold any...
Kissing booth!
Yeah, we want to do a kissing booth.
Okay, I think I speak for everyone
when I say kissing is the number one cause
of all germs, cavities,
shingles, gingivitis, -cold sores... -Ew.
Uh, it would be totally voluntary.
And no tongue, because we're not the French.
Most of us.
I'm British, you wanker!
[student] Excuse me,
-but would you be working the booth? -Me?
No.
We're just the organizers.
But I can assure you, we have some real A-listers lined up.
[Elle] You can count on that.
Would Flynn be working the kissing booth?
Ha! Noah?
[Lee] You'd have a better chance getting Miley Cyrus to become a nun...
Absolutely! No, Flynn will be working the booth.
I promise. Flynn will be there.
[Elle] You're about to witness a family tradition.
For as long as I can remember,
we've had lunch with the Flynns every Sunday.
-Hey, guys. -Hey!
[Elle] That's Mrs. Flynn.
She's sort of a surrogate mom to me.
I couldn't have made it through the years without her.
How's school going?
Let's just say, "interesting."
I don't know what that means, but I want to hear all the gory details later.
[Mrs. Flynn] Hey.
Hi.
Hi there.
-[Flynn] And how's my favorite little man? -I'm okay.
Hey, Noah! I haven't seen you since you got back from football camp.
They got you starting again?
Well... he'll be lucky if he makes it through the season.
He goes and gets into a fight on the first day of school.
Really? What happened?
Tell him.
[Elle] Here it comes.
It was just an argument over something that happened at football camp.
Excuse me.
[Elle] Wonder why he didn't say anything.
Our booth is going to kick ass at the carnival.
Oh, and news update:
Mia stopped me in the hall and said that she's going to the party tonight.
She wanted to make sure that I would be there.
Well, sir, I wish you the best of luck with that.
Oh, I have to go to practice right now.
Can you still give me a ride afterwards?
Oh, I can't. I'm taking my parents to the airport.
But Noah can give you a ride.
Convince him to do the booth.
You're gonna have to ask him eventually.
[Noah] We're having a party at my place tonight if you guys want to come.
My parents aren't going to be home, so there's gonna be drinks.
-My brother will be there, but you know. -Hey.
I'll catch you guys later.
[cheerleader] Bye.
He's so cute!
Hey.
Lee said that you're gonna give me a ride.
-Yeah. -Where's your car?
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
Look, I have a spare helmet. You'll be fine.
I'm not gonna get on that thing like one of your make-out girls.
They don't all make out with me.
Okay, so like,
95% of them make out with me, but that is clearly not what's happening here,
so if you could just get on the damned bike please.
It's so beautiful outside, I think I'm gonna go for a run.
-Are you serious? It's like five miles. -What?
-Are you serious? -I'm sorry. Can't hear you.
I'll see you at the party, okay?
No, you won't. I told you not to come.
[Elle] Better get used to disappointment!
See? I knew that you could hear me.
What?
No.
[Elle] Hey guys!
Need peeps to work our kissing booth. You in?
No thanks. I'd rather be a customer.
-Not in this lifetime, girl! -Never gonna happen.
-You're kidding, right? -Oh, hell no!
[Elle] This could be a problem.
Hey!
So nobody wants to work the booth.
Getting those A-listers may be harder than I thought.
We need to up our game. I really want to pull this off.
Cool.
You see? I told you she'd come.
Hey, Ellen! Come here!
The OMGs want to talk to me twice in one week!
[Elle] All right!
Oh, and tell Mia I'm awesome.
Yeah, for sure.
Hey!
Hey, girl!
What's Gucci?
You will love this.
Tastes like green.
Oh, no, I really don't drink.
Just shoot it, girl!
Go!
Get it, girl. -Mmm! -Ooh.
Wow! That does taste like green!
I know, right?
So have you asked him yet?
Asked who?
Flynn, silly!
[Gwyneth] About the booth.
Oh, he looks busy.
You're funny!
I love this hoe!
I love you!
-Go! -Go!
-Right now? -Go!
Okay!
Yes, honey! Get it!
I haven't seen Lee.
What?
The OMG Girls want to know if you'll do our kissing booth.
No.
Okay, you win, Noah. You want me to wash your motorcycle?
Polish your trophies? [gasps]
Did you just put hands on me?
Easybake Oven is downstairs, bitch!
Okay, you should probably leave.
What?
She's like important to my family, which kind of makes her important to me.
Are you for serious?
Leave.
Uh, sorry I ruined your make-out sesh.
Oh, it's fine. She kind of tasted like Cheetos anyway.
That's gross.
So...
Kissing booth?
Absolutely not.
Awesome.
Oh, my God! That was so savage!
-That girl totally left! -Yeah.
You'll love this.
Tastes like pink.
So, Flynn's still doing the booth?
Between us girls,
Noah Flynn basically does whatever I tell him.
Oh, shit!
Oh, yeah! That's right! That's what happens when you mess with me.
You're holding it completely wrong. Just--
Warren! Can you just play the game? I know how to hold a controller.
-Oh, yes! Come on! You got it! -Boring!
[all chanting] Drink! Drink! Drink!
Holy shit, bro! Check it out.
Oh, my gosh!
It's hot out here!
-Dude! -Oh, no
I'm totally dying.
No!
I'm taking this off.
-I bet you she does. I bet you. -No.
Who cares?
We should go skinny dipping!
-Absolutely! -Yearbook!
-Yeah! -Dude, let's do it!
Okay...
Here I come. I'm gonna...
Who is this? Are you-- are you a girl princess or a boy princess?
You smell good.
[Elle] Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I'm in Noah's t-shirt!
Oh, no!
Dress is missing but underwear is still on.
Okay. We can work with that.
Oh, sweet mercy!
Sorry.
It's okay.
I didn't mean to wake you. I was just grabbing some clothes.
So, how bad was I?
You were about to strip on the pool table in front of a bunch of guys
and then go skinny dipping.
I carried you out before too much came off.
Oh, and you threw up on your dress.
Noah, I am so sorry.
It's okay. But I mean, this is exactly what I was talking about, Shelly.
Oh, this is so embarrassing!
Oh, I hope I didn't snore.
Elle, I...
I slept in the guest room.
Oh, yeah.
Of course.
Okay.
I am assuming the t-shirt means you saw me in my underwear?
-Yep. -Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Okay!
Shorts, please!
Can you... please?
Noah!
-Noah! -All right, fine.
I'll just get it myself!
-Stop pulling! -I'm not pulling anything!
Okay, well my arm is caught! Let me just reach down and...
Oh, my God! I just touched it!
I said stop wiggling!
Sorry!
Aren't you forgetting something? My t-shirt.
-Your t-shirt. Right. I'm sorry. -Elle!
-What? -Jesus!
I was kidding!
-So, I should... -Just get out, dork.
Okay, yeah. Yeah.
Never let me drink again.
It's okay. I got it covered.
Made you an emergency survival kit.
Some granola, sports drinks, antacids, and an epic dose of awkward shame!
Thank you.
Oh, and... really good work last night.
What do you mean?
You told everybody that Noah and the OMGs
would be doing the kissing booth.
Come on!
And even though I felt like I was about to puke my liver out,
I couldn't stop thinking about Noah.
Our accidental groping.
It seemed like he just saw me as a little sister,
but I couldn't help wondering if he had a different reason for protecting me.
Listen, it's all about the OMGs.
We get them to do the booth, everyone else will follow.
-Do you want to go over the plan again? -No, I think I got it.
-Okay, wish me luck! -Good luck.
Okay!
Have you guys seen this text?
[OMG Girl] Hey, Ellen!
Hey...
It's "Elle," actually. No "N."
Why are you standing and talking instead of sitting and talking?
Oh, yeah, okay.
Ask Mia about me!
-Lee wants to know if you like him. -Flynn's brother?
Yeah, he's cute. Needs to learn to dress, though.
But more importantly,
everything's set for the kissing booth, right?
Okay, so here's what I just heard.
Flynn likes one of you. Yeah.
And rumor has it that if the person he likes is working the booth,
then he'll be there, too.
Wait! Didn't we tell you?
Tell me what?
Now that we're all besties,
we would totally do the kissing booth, girl. Just for you.
-Really? -You're one of us now, girl.
Totally!
-Thank you, guys. -Sure!
You can call us bitches.
Thank you!
Bitches!
[all] You're welcome!
[Elle] So we've got a pretty solid line up now,
but we're still down one Noah Flynn, though.
But let's focus on the booth.
I'm going to make the letters,
and then you are going to make everything else. Okay?
We're only two days away from the carnival so we need to move. Chop-chop!
Have I ever told you that you're bossy?
Yes, but then I told you not to tell me that anymore.
-Ha-ha-ha. You're funny. -I prefer the term "witty."
-I'm more of a slapstick guy myself. -Really?
I am sorry. Was that the wrong color?
Oh, you're gonna...
Oh, you're so dead!
Hello.
Holy shit! She looks like a hot Braveheart!
-You need to leave. -Stop it!
I told you before, stop messing around.
I'll leave when I want to!
You're not the boss of me, Noah.
Yearbook!
I'll just delete this immediately.
Come on, let's just go, huh?
I mean it.
Now put your shirt on and get out.
[Elle] What he said made sense. It also meant he cared.
But what came out of my mouth was...
I told you to stop telling me what to do.
[Elle] Watch this, Noah Flynn.
Go, Elle!
Go, Elle!
-Hey. -Hey.
Um, listen...
I know that we don't really see eye-to-eye on things,
but I'm-- I'm desperate.
So maybe if you could just stop by the booth for a little.
I don't know. I just...
It would mean a lot to me.
Wow.
The independent Elle Evans
who doesn't want to be told what to do by anyone,
is begging somebody else for help.
It is what it is, Noah.
I mean, I just really thought that maybe it would be nice for you to do something
for people that care about you.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!
Come one, come all, behold the power and raw intensity of a kiss
from one of our beautiful people!
A ticket and a mint, which we encourage each and every single one of you to use!
Just gonna be $5.
All sales and epic smooches are final!
As you may have noticed, there's a slight twist to this kissing booth.
The people you will be kissing are blindfolded!
First up, for the ladies.
The one and only Ollie!
All right!
And for the guys,
the breathtakingly hot Olivia!
Alrighty, let's do this thing!
-I'll take that. -Thank you! A great smootch!
Ollie!
Yeah!
He needs a $20!
Yeah!
Okay, give this guy two mints.
-We are killing it. -Yeah!
But we do have one problem.
The girls are asking for Flynn,
and I have a solution.
Alrighty!
As promised, the next kisser is Flynn!
Hold on. That is not Flynn.
That is Lee Flynn.
The only reason I ever talked to that dork
was to make sure he'd get his brother to come to the booth tonight.
Let's go.
I guess I'm next.
I hope you like what you see.
Hey, Elle.
So, we're gonna hang out now.
Oh, but there's another hour left.
Okay.
Yeah.
Just don't do anything I wouldn't do.
All right, see you later.
[Elle] Rule number 18: always be happy for your bestie's successes.
For me, that one has always been easy to follow.
No ways!
I can't.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
[Mia] Imagine having to kiss that!
I can't do it! Not with him!
-Gross. -It's payback time for lying about Flynn.
-Who? Who's out there? -It's Olivia's ex.
And the problem is we're all really good friends.
Right, Olivia?
-Yeah.Totally. -Yeah.
[Mia] Say, Elle,
you don't know Olivia's ex at all, do you?
-No, well... -Then it's solved!
Oh, no, Mia, please! I don't think this is a good idea.
-Cutsies? -What?
Cutsies.
-[Elle] No, Mia! -[Mia] Time to get your dirty-girl on!
Thanks, dude.
[Elle] Guys, I've never...
Sorry.
Oh, muscles!
Sorry. Okay. Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Sorry. I know that you were
probably expecting Olivia, so we don't have to do anything if you don't want to.
Truth be told, I've never kissed anyone before.
[Elle] It's not that I haven't wanted to, don't get me wrong.
For example, I punched Ron Getler
in the sixth grade during Seven Minutes in Heaven.
Sophomore year, Spring Fling,
I was dancing with Randy Melrose.
You know, a romantic song came on.
I was like, "Oh ,it's gonna happen!" But... until...
it just didn't, cause...
[Elle] This isn't so bad.
Not so bad at all.
Wait!
There...
Everyone-- everyone just saw that, didn't they?
Yup. Pretty much.
Oh, my God! Kill me now!
Come on. Relax, Shelly. It was just a kiss.
[Elle] Was it, Noah? Was it just a kiss?
Yeah. Of course.
All right.
So I'll-- I'll see you around.
Keep up the good work, huh?
"Good word?" What the...?
"Good work."
And then it hit me.
Holy crap! What am I going to tell Lee?
[Lee] That was really close.
Hey.
Oh, hey. I'll be right back, okay? Oh! That was really close!
-[Elle] Hey. -Hey. Is everything okay?
Yeah, the booth is crushing it!
We have made more than all the other booths combined.
-No way! -It turns out people
really like to kiss!
What?
And get this: I even wound up kissing your brother!
What?
Come on, Lee. It's no big deal. Seriously.
What?
It's for charity, right?
Yeah...
I guess so.
Just don't end up grinding coochies with my brother,
or I'll literally never talk to you again.
That and Rule Number Nine, of course.
Of course! Right.
Come on, Lee. Seriously. As if.
[Elle] As I ran home,
I wondered if our kiss meant anything to Noah.
If I meant anything.
How about a ride?
Come on, Shelly.
You know my mom will kill me if I leave you out here.
[Elle] Holding on to Noah,
I couldn't stop thinking about the promise I had made to Lee.
It's getting too dangerous. I'm pulling over.
[Elle] But who knows if Noah even wanted to kiss me again.
That didn't really matter though.
Because I still wanted to kiss him.
You know, if we wait out this rain, we should be fine.
Wait, no.
I cannot just be another one of your conquests.
Is that what you think of me?
It's what everyone thinks of you.
You want to know the truth?
You are the only girl who doesn't fall at my feet.
And it is driving me crazy.
It's one of the things I like about you.
You're sweet.
But you're not afraid to call me out on things.
And here I was thinking I was just your brother's annoying best friend.
Well, yeah. There's that too.
[Noah] Look, I don't know what all this means.
I just like hanging out with you.
It feels right.
I'm just...
I'm so confused right now.
Did that clear anything up?
No, I think we'd better try again.
-[man] Security. -Oh, my God! We're gonna die!
[security officer] Is that you, Flynn?
I thought I told you not to bring girls around here anymore.
What?
You just took me to your hookup spot?
No! You know what? Unbelievable!
Thanks, Andrew.
Still mad at you, but I am cold as shit!
And you are taking me home.
Now!
Thanks for the ride.
You know, I meant when I said, Elle.
Good for you.
So I'll see you tomorrow?
-Hey. -Hey.
Why didn't Lee give you a ride home tonight?
He just got busy.
But that is the only reason you're on the back of Noah Flynn's motorcycle, right?
Of course. Duh. Come on.
In spite of what happened tonight,
I couldn't stop thinking about what Noah said to me.
And even though I know I shouldn't,
how much I wanted to believe him.
Rule Number Six.
If you can't tell your best friend about something you're doing,
you probably shouldn't be doing it.
[crowd] Five, four, three, two, one.
Go!
Yeah!
Go, Elle!
Yeah!
Go, Elle!
Chug! Chug! Chug!
[all chanting] Chug! Chug! Chug!
Looking good, Evans.
Thanks.
We never did get to finish your skinny dip at Flynn's party.
I was just way too drunk that night, so...
-You know what you need? -Hmm?
Hot tub. Come on.
Oh, no, that's okay, Warren.
-Come on, Evans. It'll be nice. -No, Warren.
-Evans, come on! Don't make me beg. -Warren?
-I'm not feeling well, Warren. -She said no, Warren!
Okay. That's okay.
[Elle] Okay. I'm fine.
It's all right. Can we-- Can you just take me home, please?
Okay. Just walk away. Hey, just walk away.
Let's go.
Hey, come on, man. It's all good.
I guess I'd also be pretty pissed if I was slumming it
with my little brother's sloppy seconds.
Oh, shit!
Elle, wait!
Wait!
Elle!
Just get in the car, Elle.
Just get in the car, Elle.
Get in the car, Elle!
Please.
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
What do you think? You think I meant to fall for my brother's best friend?
Wait, this isn't the way home.
I want to show you something.
How many girls have you made out with in this spot?
I only come here alone.
Until now.
Oh, you are good!
That sounds so great when you say it.
You must know that, right?
Such a player.
You haven't changed.
I mean, what is the difference between what just happened...
The difference is you.
You're crazy.
I'm crazy about you, Elle.
[Elle] He is good.
Okay.
Okay.
Here's how this is gonna work.
Rules. Number one:
No more fighting.
Done.
Number two:
No more telling me what to do.
Cross my heart.
And number three:
If we do this, nobody can know.
Okay? At least until...
I figure out a way to tell Lee. It has to be that way.
You know, you're cute when you're bossy.
-I'm serious, Noah. -So am I.
You're really, really cute!
Promise.
Hey.
I promise.
You know, we don't have to.
[Elle] You know when the time is right.
And this was our time.
Noah and his stupid, sexy smirk got the best of me.
And I was happy about it.
But now what am I going to do?
This is all your fault, kissing booth!
Nope. No. Nope. Never work.
What's wrong?
We're supposed to be in a logistics meeting right now. Okay?
We're trying to figure out how not to get caught.
I don't see what the big deal is.
It's not like anyone's gonna think that I have a girlfriend.
Oh, yeah, God forbid anyone actually thinks you're in a relationship.
Hey! I have my reputation to think of.
Is that so?
-Oh, 'tis so! -Really?
Shit! Hide!
-Just a minute. -[Mrs. Flynn] I need to get your laundry.
Go, go down there. Yeah! Just one second, Mom!
Hold on.
Yup, come in
-Hi, honey. -Hey, Mom.
You know, I could have brought the laundry down.
It's okay. I have an hour to kill before your dad and I will meet the Andersons.
Oh, no.
Shit!
Oh, and by the way, don't forget.
We're going out on Saturday to celebrate your big news.
-We don't have to, Mom. -Of course, we do.
It's not every day you get accepted to an Ivy League school.
Oh! And I invited the Evanses.
Do me a favor.
Be sweet to Elle.
She kind of has a crush on you.
Really? I had no idea.
Of course you didn't. Boys never do.
-[snorts] -Shut up!
-[laughing] -Elle has a crush on you.
She's not even supposed to be here.
I have to be downstairs in ten minutes and work on the prom banner with Lee.
So, Ivy League school, huh?
It's not a big deal.
Which school?
Harvard.
Are you shitting me?
That's amazing!
I don't even know if I'm gonna go or not yet.
Listen, you can't tell anybody about this, okay?
[Elle] And that was the first time it hit me.
Noah would be leaving for college. Soon.
But we need to get you out of here, and lucky for you,
I've got your escape route all figured out.
Okay.
You've got to be kidding me.
Or we could just go tell Lee now.
-Hey! -Hey!
Are you still wearing your clothes?
Um... yes.
Oh. Okay. I'll be down in a second.
Okay.
Geronimo!
[Lee] Oh, hey, I think you got a text from someone.
-I'll see who it is. -That's okay. I got it.
Lee, I said I'll get it.
Why, is it from a boy?
Yeah, right.
Since when do you have a lock on your phone?
Um... little bro keeps getting into it.
Elle!
-Hey! -[Mrs. Flynn] Hi!
Put your foot over the bike.
Sit.
Yes, Elle!
Come on!
I can't!
Hello!
-Hey! -I heard moaning!
I was watching porn.
-Oh. -Yeah.
-Can I watch? -Do you want to wait for me downstairs?
-Yeah. -Thank you. I'll be there in a second.
♪ That I can't get away... ♪
Seriously? In here? Noah!
-Yes! -I did it!
That's incredible.
Stink bomb? Are you kidding me? Where did you even learn that?
Miss Evans?
Listen, I'm so sorry.
I just thought it was gonna make a little bit of fog.
Hey, this is great. I really needed this.
Yeah, we really haven't been hanging out much, right?
You've been, like, acting really weird recently.
Wait.
Is this because you don't have a date to prom?
Because if that's it, you can come with Rachel and I.
[Elle] Stop lying to your best friend. It's time.
Lee, there is something I wanted to tell you.
-[Rachel] Hey, guys! -Hey, you made it!
-[Rachel] Sorry. Traffic was crazy. -Hey!
Hey!
So, it's okay if Elle comes to prom with us, right?
Absolutely! The more, the merrier!
See?
So, what was it you were saying?
Oh, nothing.
It was about prom. So...
-Okay. Off. My turn. -[Lee] Bully!
Stupid.
I swear to God. Says it right here.
It's so her!
Hey, could you pass me the wrench, please?
The little black tool box on top of the shelf.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
Elle!
When'd you become such a doctor?
Since I started getting into fights.
You kind of learn to take care of yourself when that happens.
Why do you get in all those fights anyway?
I think I...
I guess it's kind of just how I'm wired.
I don't believe that.
My parents even sent me to see a couple of counselors.
But you know, we're all fucked up one way or another, right?
You could change.
You think I can change?
You're Noah Flynn.
I don't think there's much you can't do.
[Lee] Hey, Noah, have you seen Elle?
[Elle] Hey.
[Lee] What's going on in here?
Jesus! What happened your face?
Oh, I had an accident and Noah offered to help.
-Did you do that to her? -What did you just say?
I said did you do that to her? Did you hit Elle?
-You really think I'd hit her? -I wouldn't put it past you.
Hey, no. Lee, I'm fine.
I just tripped in the garage.
I was looking for you.
You really expect me to believe that she just tripped?
-Get a clue, Lee! You weren't even here! -I swear to God,
-if you laid a hand on her.... -All right, that's it!
Noah! Hey! Stop! Noah! Stop!
Look at me. Noah, look at me!
Come on.
Is there something going on between you two?
What?
No, nothing is going on.
Okay.
Fine.
But I really need to get out of here.
Do you want to go downstairs and start the car?
I just need to grab my things.
Look, I have to tell him tonight.
Yeah.
It's time.
That way I can take you to prom.
What the fuck?
Lee, I can explain.
Unbelievable.
Wait, no. Lee. Lee, wait.
Wait, Noah. Stay here, please.
Let me handle this.
Lee!
Lee, wait!
Lee, wait! Wait.
So this is what you've been keeping from me?
You were never meant to find out this way.
Seems I was never meant to find out at all, doesn't it?
Hey, lay off her, Lee. It's not like it's all Elle's fault.
You! Don't even get me started on you, okay?
Telling other guys to stay away from Elle to protect her.
And there you are, treating her like some slut that you picked up at the club.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
So you're trying to tell me that you two have not slept together.
I knew it.
So you really just have been fucking my brother and lying to me.
-No. -Okay, Lee. That is enough.
No, it's not enough. She has no clue what she's gotten herself into with you!
This is bullshit. You're acting like a hurt, little bitch.
-Noah, get off of him! -Stop!
-Noah, get off of him! -Calm down!
That is enough! Calm down! I'm not letting you go until you chill out!
-Get off of me! -Chill out!
-Get off! -Get off him! Get off!
Please!
Stop!
Here.
Please.
Please, Lee!
[Elle] Stop, Lee! Please!
Lee, please!
Please, Lee, don't leave like this.
So much for Rule Number Nine, huh?
I didn't mean for this to happen.
You know, my whole life,
Noah has gotten everything that he has ever wanted.
The only thing that I had that he didn't....
was you.
And now he has that too.
Lee.
It's okay.
You two deserve each other.
Elle.
Look, it's okay. He'll get over it.
Why? Why did you come downstairs?
I told you to stay inside!
Like you wanted to make things worse!
What is wrong with you?
You can not pin all this on me.
Just leave me alone.
No problem.
[Elle] Some people say you'll fall in love.
And that's the person you'll spend forever with.
They'll be the one who, no matter what, you can't live without.
But at that moment
all I cared about was Lee.
And I was pretty sure I'd lost him forever.
Hey.
Hey.
There's someone here to see you.
Lee?
Hi, Elle.
I was hoping maybe we could talk.
There's really nothing to talk about.
I'm just really sorry for lying to Lee about Noah and...
Now I've ruined our friendship.
Elle, I was friends with your mom for over 20 years.
She was my best, best friend.
But if you think that we didn't fight sometimes,
you got another thing coming.
Really?
Sure.
But you know, I can't really remember what a single fight was really about.
But what I do remember
is that we always forgave each other.
It doesn't really feel like that right now.
Don't give up on him.
You're lucky if you can get even one really good best friend in your life.
You just have to figure out how to make it right.
[Elle] I gotta admit, the next couple of weeks were pretty lonely.
Noah was totally MIA.
His attendance at school got so bad,
he was in danger of not graduating.
Worst of all,
-[phone ringing] -Lee was completely ignoring me.
At least Dad had forgiven me. He even paid for my driving lessons.
Decided it was about time I got my license.
Then one day it hit me.
Holy crap! Rule Number Seven!
No matter how mad you are at your best friend,
you have to forgive them if they give you ice cream.
I'm sorry.
[Noah] Hey, Mr. Evans.
Where have you been, Noah?
I had to get away and think.
I'm...
I'm on my way home now.
Good.
Listen, Elle's not here.
I'm actually here to talk to you.
I just...
I wanted to apologize.
About everything.
I shouldn't have let it happen.
It was all my fault.
Not Elle's.
But I'm not sorry that it did happen.
Or for the way that I feel about your daughter.
Oh, Noah.
I can't say I support the two of you. I can't.
But it's got to be Elle's choice.
I just think that Elle is gonna have to figure out what's best for Elle.
I understand.
Hey... so I have been thinking about our birthday party after prom,
and I was leaning towards like a costume party, maybe?
-Hells yes! -Yes.
Come on, you know me.
Any excuse to cross-dress and I'm in!
Holy...
I know, right?
Dad, are you...?
Come here!
You have fun tonight. Okay, Ellie-bear?
-Okay. -Okay.
No way!
This is amazing!
Look!
Oh, come on!
Hey, Yearbook Guy.
-Yeah? -These pictures...
really good, dude.
Kind of makes you a little less annoying.
Thanks!
Hello, Los Angeles Country Day Prom!
Now, I'd like to introduce this year's theme:
Memories.
Photographs which show images of great moments
from a truly fantastic year.
The moments that stood out
and helped to define who we are as a class.
It's a final look back on who we were,
at the very moment that we're looking forward to who we want to become.
[British Beauty] So, for everyone out there,
let's make this prom the very best!
Onward to Memory Lane!
Oh, my!
It's amazing!
This is so cool!
Who did this? It's beautiful!
Oh, my God.
What's that all about?
I don't know.
Guys!
You guys are too much.
[Rachel] Hey!
[Elle] It was at this exact moment that I finally felt okay.
I wasn't thinking about Noah,
or Lee, or anybody.
I was a small part of something that mattered.
The kissing booth meant something to people.
It was gonna be remembered by everybody.
And that made me happy.
Until I saw him.
Elle.
I think you're next up.
I'm sorry, Noah.
I can't.
No, Elle, wait, please!
Elle.
Why?
Why should I?
Because I love you.
And standing here,
in front of everyone,
I'm telling you
that I love you.
I'm sorry.
I just...
I can't keep hurting people that I care about because of you.
Okay? Nobody wants us to be together.
Well, that may be true.
But what do you want?
I want...
I want to go.
Elle.
Hey, Elle! Wait up!
Hey.
Hey.
Listen.
I just came to say I'm sorry about what happened on the lawn the other day.
And for everything with Elle.
I never should have been lying to you.
But I wanted you to know that...
I was never playing Elle.
And I meant everything that I said to her tonight.
And not that you care,
but I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.
I figured I'd try to get settled in before the fall term. You know?
All right.
Well, I'll see you around, eh?
Oh, and...
Happy birthday, man.
[Lee] Rachel's getting here in ten minutes.
Is Noah gonna be here tonight?
He told me last night he was leaving for Harvard today.
He just didn't want to be around here.
But hey, it's for the best.
I mean, I think you did the right thing.
Don't you?
Yeah.
So, what'd you wish for?
No, you know the rules.
[Elle] Rule Number One:
Only your best friend gets to know your birthday wishes.
So, how about you?
No wish this year.
Okay.
Hey!
Where you going?
I can't keep doing this.
Doing what?
Elle, what's wrong?
Hey!
You're acting all weird.
I love you.
And I always, always
want to be close to you.
But being my best friend
doesn't give you the right to tell me who I can love.
It's like with Rachel.
What if I didn't like having her around? What would you do then?
-I guess I'd break up with her. -No, you see?
You shouldn't have to do that just because I didn't want you to be with her.
No. Come on, Elle.
This isn't the same thing as with Noah and you know that.
Okay. Listen to me, Lee.
We made up our rules when we were six.
What are you saying?
I'm saying that I love Noah.
And I want him.
And I'm sorry if that hurts you,
and I'm so sorry that I lied to you before.
I was wrong.
But I'd be lying to you again if I didn't tell you that I love him
with every bit of my heart.
And if you just can't accept that,
then...
Then maybe you can't be part of my life.
I think you're making a big mistake.
Then that's my decision to make.
[Lee] You're right.
I love you, Elle, and I just want you to be happy.
Thank you!
Okay.
I have to find him. Like now.
It's okay. I'll help you find him, okay?
Okay, let me go just make sure my dad knows where I'm going, okay?
Meet you outside in five, and you can drive the Stang.
-Thank you. I love you so much! Thank you! -Go!
[Elle] Here we go!
Thank you for doing this, by the way.
[Lee] No problem.
You know,
I think the hardest part was just seeing Noah's face at prom.
Gosh, I wish I had just told him then.
But you know what? No matter
how he feels now, I've just gotta find him and tell him how I feel.
You just did.
Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God! -Oh, Jesus, woman! Pull over!
Pull over! Pull the car over!
-My God! You're trying to kill us! -[Elle] Oh, my God!
I was not expecting that!
Oh, my God! Like, what?
Hi!
I thought you were leaving for Harvard.
Yeah, I was planning to, but...
I decided I had to see you one last time before I went.
Noah.
And then Lee came upstairs and he told me everything.
And the old switcheroo was his idea?
-It was like a classic Lee, huh? -Yeah!
He said something about Rule Number 18 or whatever.
[Elle] Rule Number 18:
Always be happy for your bestie's successes.
Yeah. Classic Lee.
Thanks for staying a little longer.
Well, I had to see you blow out the candles on your cake.
Happy birthday to me.
So, what about Harvard?
I don't want to talk about that right now.
You know, I want to know what it was that you wanted to tell me.
Sitting here in front of...
no one in particular,
I'm saying I love you.
And I love you.
[Elle] The next few weeks before Noah left for school
we spent every spare minute together...
up to the very last second.
Goodbye.
Come on, Shelly. Don't say it like that.
I'll see you soon, and you can come and visit.
-And we can make this work. -Okay, stop.
Don't say anything.
I just want to be with you for a few seconds more.
You are cute when you're being bossy!
And don't turn back for a final wave.
That is way too cheesy and romantic.
Even for me.
Okay.
See you.
[Elle] Maybe things really would work out with Noah.
I hoped they would.
But maybe they wouldn't.
And no matter how much I wanted it,
things couldn't stay the way they were forever.
But whatever happened,
I knew there was a part of me
that was always going to belong to Noah Flynn.
A little piece of my heart
that would always be Noah's.
And for the first time,
everything suddenly seemed...
possible.
But it's funny when I think about it.
Because all this happened
just because of a kissing booth.
Nine gold diggers, take two.
Common-- A and B common mark.
Mark.
-No. -How could that happen?
Hell no!
-Who am I? -A total Comic-con dork?
-Hey. -Hey.
Check it out.
-Do it. -Oh, my--
Yearbook!
Yeah!
I'll make out with you.
So... sweet of you. I'm okay, though. Thank you.
Oh, you're dead!
Oh, wait! Flynn wears Superman boxers?
Look! You're blushing! How cute!
First of all, if you mention this to anyone, and I mean anyone...
-Kissing booth. -What?
I save you, and now you're trying to blackmail me.
Oh, come on.
Sounds so tawdry when you put it that way, but yes, definitely.
-Out! -Okay. I'm going.
[Brad] Elle?
It's Brad!
[Brad] Elle?
Boom! I got you! In your face!
You can't do that!
What?!
It's a 1995 Ford Probe!
-Oh, my God! -You like it?
Are you crazy, Dad? I love it!
Good, now you can take Mr. Stinks-a-lot to baseball practice.
Hey, I don't stink that bad!
Disco rules!
Oh, my God! I won!
Do you think you could maybe get a ride home with somebody else?
I think she might even let me play with her boobies later.
You're picking boobies over my awesomeness?
Boobies. My answer is always gonna be boobies.
My new screen saver.
I'm just not really sure if I like that one more or that one.
[Lee] So appealing in their own way. Don't you think?
Oh, God! I can't look any more.
It was such a pleasant surprise to hear from you after so long.
I am fine
and doing all those things which you know are expected of me in this country.
I am glad that you are making a fresh start.
There is an old saying that there are things a man can only learn in a city.
I have found this to be true. But do not be distracted, my son.
Focus on your studies. Your goals. We will discuss both when you visit.
I shall do better from now on to try to keep in contact with you.
Dad."
[captain] We are beginning our final descent into John F. Kennedy Airport.
Thank you for flying with us and have a pleasant night in New York City.
[conductor over PA] Due to police activity, the next stop on this local train will be 125th Street.
Shit.
[man] Get out of the street!
[guard] Can I help you?
Ah, no. No... [stammers] I'm fine, thanks. Ah...
-Just admiring the campus. -You got some ID?
This is a private campus. You can't just wander in here.
Uh... I'm a student. I just transferred here. [stammers] I...
I need to see your student ID.
[stammers] I haven't got one yet.
I'm sorry, pal. I'm gonna have to ask you to move along.
[Saleem] Don't make me tell you again, motherfucker!
I have a gun, and I will shoot you in the face!
Saleem? [stammers] It's Barry from Occidental. We... we met a few months back, at Amir's party?
I'm sorry to knock on your door like this, but you're the only person I--
Barry?
Barry, my brother!
Come. Come. Come in. Come in. Yes.
[Saleem] Damn, bro! You moving in or what?
[Barry] I got locked out of my place. My roommate Will isn't in town--
Nah, don't worry, man. I just got off work.
Barry, Rachel. Rachel, Barry.
Raquel.
-Raquel. That's what I said. -[stammers] It's nice to meet you, Raquel.
She looked better a few hours ago. If you know what I mean.
Here, take a beer. Give me that. [grunts]
I'll give you the grand tour. This is where the magic happens.
This is the parlor room. [grunts]
Come on. Sit, sit, sit.
Anyway, welcome to New York.
[man on radio] The issue today is not the Republicans, it is the republic.
Today it is not the Democrats, it is the democracy.
There's a crisis in the character of our nation.
-You ready? -It's creating tension between the races, Uh, five minutes.
tension between the sexes.
We are not each other's problem. We are each other's solution.
[Andre] Yo, college boy.
[sniffs] Lemme get a square.
-Yo! You need one? -Yeah.
Let me get another one.
-Got a light, college? -Of course, Andre.
-What up? -Hey.
So, what you studying up there, huh?
-A little bit of everything. -Hmm.
You best take economics or some shit. Get that paper and get gone.
-I just got here. -[scoffs]
But you ain't stayin'.
See you around.
-[Will] Later. -Later.
[professor] "Justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger."
Now, we all know the Greeks loved symbols, right?
They have since antiquity.
So what, then, was the great symbol of democracy in Plato's time?
Uh, yes. Um... Barry.
That's correct. The raised hand. One man, one vote. All of it very public.
But when you imagine those raised hands, class, you have to remember,
every one of them held a spear.
That's what "majority rule" meant.
So that begs the question,
is governmental rule always supported by the threat of violence?
-[professor] Yes, Thad? -It has to be.
-Otherwise, what authority would it have? -But, what about the will of the people?
-Sure. The people with the most spears. -[Barry] But there's more to it than that.
I mean, we sacrifice some of our, um, independence to a government
in return for security.
And a kind of collective wisdom. Security's just another word for "the most spears."
Every time there was a vote,
the minority didn't count up the spears and, uh, decide not to revolt.
Once you make the deal to have a government,
that government takes on another kind of authority.
What, like a moral authority?
-Well-- -So Ronald Reagan has moral authority?
Of course he does! He was elected in a landslide!
Okay, if there's one thing Ronald Reagan definitely does not have,
it's moral authority.
-Sure has a great head of hair, though. -[students chuckle]
[professor] Sorry, just kidding. Continue.
[Barry] Let me put it like this--
if the states had voted on slavery, we would have lost the vote.
So, yeah,
at that point, moral authority kicks in to, uh, defend the minority
against the will of the people.
And that's when the spears come out.
Yeah, I watched the news last night too, Barry.
Jesse Jackson said that thing about slavery.
Yeah, he did. And he's right.
Seriously? The guy who hugged Yasser Arafat is right?
One thing has nothing to do with the other.
All right, guys. Reel it back in. Remember, Plato.
[Thad] Can I ask a question, though?
Why's everything always gotta be about slavery?
Hello?
Will?
Is anyone there?
[Saleem] Come on, Barry.
Jesus Christ.
-How'd you get in here? -Barry, my brother.
Do you have any ganja? My head is pounding.
Check the ashtray.
-What are you doing here? -[groans]
This whole university experience has changed my life, bro.
You're a bartender, Saleem.
So, what brings you to the West Side?
Last night at the West End, I met this beautiful bird.
Sociology student from Minnesota.
Porcelain features, tits out to here. [chuckles]
I mean, we wandered the city all night...
But when the time came, I was unable to gain entrance to her dormitory.
Uh, so to speak.
So to speak.
So I stopped at the establishment on the corner for a morning beer,
after which I decided to pop up here for a smoke.
And to borrow some cab fare home, if possible?
You know, this, this might sound crazy, but just bear with me.
Do you think there might be some kind of, uh, correlation
between your constantly buying alcohol and, uh, cocaine
and the fact that you're always broke?
It's an interesting theory, but I just don't see it.
Speaking of booze and blow,
my friend, Daphne, is having a party tonight. Ah!
Daphne is a burlesque dancer. All her friends are burlesque dancers.
I don't have to spell it out for you, do I, Barry?
What do you say, I take a nap, stay here, and we go together around nine?
I promised Will I'd go to a party on campus.
They will never accept us, Barry. I know you know this, my brother.
-I don't know. I wanna think they will. -You think too much.
That's your problem. That's why you never get laid!
-I'm not trying to just get laid. -Okay, see what I mean?
Fucking shit, man. Look, if I were you... [sighs]
[imitating Barry] Hello there, rich white girl. My name is Barry.
I, uh, just transferred here from Africa.
I'm a deep, brooding man
who likes to, uh... write poems about the mysteries of the human condition.
Now, would you like to, uh, unzip my pants, or shall I?"
That's pretty good. I didn't know you could do me.
[in normal voice] Oh, well, the trick is to sound just white enough.
Okay, fuck you, Saleem.
-Barry! Barry! I love you! -Yeah, yeah.
[PJ] That's all right. That's all right.
Y'all need all the help y'all can get right about now.
[PJ] Y'all need all the help.
Check ball.
Believe me, playboy, it's about to go down.
This can play right here.
-[man 1] You got him? Switch. -[man 2] Get on him!
[PJ] Guess what? That's game, baby.
-[man 1] That's game. -Uh-huh.
-Next! -Nice, PJ.
Get these boys outta here, man.
[PJ] Yeah.
Next!
I got "Invisible Man."
You like that, Invisible? That's my shot, baby.
I can stick that all day.
I won't let you shoot.
[man 3] This boy got you, PJ.
[PJ] Hey, it's all right, player. Yeah.
You ain't gonna get too many more of them now that I know you a lefty.
You better counter with what you got, man.
Big man!
-Hey, come on, come on. -You don't know me, homeboy.
You touch me again, I'll knock your fuckin' head off.
Y'all ball.
What you got, Invisible? Ball up!
I'm on you all day, baby. Like flies on shit, baby.
What's up?
Well, Jack Kerouac went here, know what I mean?
Allen Ginsberg. Uh, Paul Robeson. [stammers] Where are those guys now?
Uh... Dead. Kerouac is, for sure.
-Who is Paul Robeson again? -Where is that scene?
[stammers] 'Cause it seems like it doesn't exist.
Or, well, maybe I'm just not cool enough to find it.
C'mon, dude, you just-- we're new, you know? It takes time.
You ready to do this?
-I know these guys. -Cool.
-All right. -I'll go get us some beers.
Sara said she was gonna be here like, half an hour ago.
-Well, there you go. -I'm over it.
So, uh, what are our options?
-Rum and Coke? -That's gross.
-Or Jack. -Gross.
Well, not Jack. It's an extremely cheap whiskey.
-I'll take one of those. -Okay, sure.
-Three? -Uh, sure. Yeah.
-Okay. -[woman] Okay.
-Cheers. -[man and woman] Cheers.
[whistles] Hey, keg stand time. Get the fuck in here.
No, no, no.
-[man 1] Let's go. -[man 2] Yup, there we go.
[all] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. [cheering]
eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. [cheering]
[Thad] All right, who's next?
Let's go. You know what? Let him go. Here we go.
[woman] He said he was coming.
-[man] Yeah, I guess you get to plan. -[woman] Thanks.
Hey. You're in my Poli-Sci class.
-Julie, right? -Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good with names. Uh, Barry.
Hi. Uh, and this is Charlotte.
Uh, "moral authority."
-That better not catch on. -Oh, I, uh, think it just did.
It's an inside joke.
-[man] Hey, Julie, what's up? -So, uh, where are you from?
Hawaii. Indonesia. Kenya. Take your pick.
Really? Um... Ni vizuri kukutana na wewe. -Uh-huh.
Really? What? In front of all these people?
I mean, you're very pretty, and I'm flattered, but--
-No, that's not I was trying to say-- -I'm just messing with you.
-[chuckles] -I have no idea what you just said.
I've never been to Kenya, but I take it you have.
Nairobi... for five days, on my junior year abroad.
It's beautiful.
I'm going this summer to, um, to visit my dad.
-[Julie] You comin' in? -I just came out.
Um... Bad?
It's not my scene.
So, what is your scene?
Um, I'm still trying to figure that out.
You like to dance?
-[man] Taxi. Taxi, yo! -[Barry] Where are you taking me?
Trust me, come on. Hey.
Hey.
So, what do you think?
-This is great! -Stick with me, kid.
Could I have a beer and a special?
Hey, baby.
You're adorable.
Who are you here with?
-[stammers] A friend. -Do you guys like to party?
Define "party."
Adorable.
-Have you ever seen this? -No.
It's a New York thing.
I dunno, man, it's-- It feels provincial up here somehow.
Like it's a bubble.
I mean, most of these kids, their futures are already set.
Like, um, that guy's gonna be an econ major, and then Wall Street.
He thinks he wants to study history,
but everything's pushing him in another direction.
His family, his background, what people expect of him.
So, does he really even have free will?
You gotta take Moral Philosophy, man, I'm telling you.
We talk about this stuff all day.
I read somewhere that, uh, college isn't about learning. [stammers] It's about training.
Training for what?
To want what you don't need, and to leave who you are at the door.
But we're supposed to leave who we are at the door. That's the point.
Well, some people can't leave who they are at the door. I mean...
You know I'm the only Black person in four of my five classes.
But you're half white, too.
What's that supposed to mean?
Just that... you can fit in anywhere.
-Right? -I fit in nowhere, Will.
But... [clears throat] -I did meet this girl last night. -Yeah?
-Am I late? -No, it's just started. C'mon. [Ed Koch on TV] No, I'm relying on the common sense of the people.
I'm hesitant to judge whether or not we've accomplished
the first part of what had to be done with this fiscal stability -so as to bring it to the point -True.
-so as to bring it to the point -True.
where we could enhance the services and we have, in fact,
improved some of the services in the first four years...
The biggest city in America,
and this guy gets to run as a Democrat and a Republican?
It's a fucking joke.
Well, nobody's watching except us.
-So... why are we watching? -It's our civic duty.
You know, politics is bullshit.
You don't really believe that, do you?
Yeah. I mean, kinda.
I mean, come on, the president's an actor.
So how does change happen, then?
-Or do you not believe in change, either? -I believe in art.
I believe in... I don't know.
People creating change. I just don't believe in--
If you say "the system," I'm going to scream.
-The system. -Oh, you're one of them!
-What? A socialist? -A poet!
I am a poet, actually.
You're cute.
What's cute about me?
Your politics.
Hmm. My politics... are cute.
Yeah.
I'll take that.
...only when we have the money to do it.
Then I'm asking you to come to the polls, 'cause my opponent is apathy.
People have to know that if you want me back, come to the polls
because the people who don't like me are gonna rush to the polls
and that is the message that I'm imploring everybody out there to consider.
Smile.
Come on, loosen up.
It's just for a second, I promise.
-Hey, wanna race? -What?
-Let's race to that tree. -You don't wanna race me. I'm fast.
-Me too. And I don't smoke a pack a day. -I'll pass.
-What? Afraid to lose to a girl? -[scoffs] I'm not afraid of losing at all.
So you'll talk shit, but you won't back it up?
Come on, Barry, show me what you got. On your mark, get set, go!
[Charlotte] I win.
-Another racist myth, debunked. -[Barry] You're pretty fast.
[man] Game point.
Good play.
What you got, homeboy? You got something?
[Barry] That's game.
Who got next?
I gotta get to class.
-You're breaking up the dynasty? -[chuckles] 'Fraid so.
Shoot to replace him?
[PJ] Open.
Nice feed, Invisible.
Ball up.
[Barry] I've never been in here.
[PJ] Best food on campus. B-school got that dough.
I used to eat in here even when I was an undergrad. [laughs]
So what, finish business school and then, uh, Wall Street? That's your plan?
Basically.
Only Black guy at your firm.
I mean, racist jokes around the water cooler?
-Workplace discrimination lawsuit. -[chuckles]
-Seven-figure settlement. -[laughs] Yeah, fair enough.
-Did you always wanna be a finance guy? -I'm from the Grant Houses.
You know where that's at?
122nd and Lenox.
It's about five blocks away, but it's a totally different world.
I didn't come this far to not make money.
I hear that.
-What about you? Where you from? -[snickers]
Well, Honolulu, mostly.
-No shit? They got brothers in Hawaii? -Yeah, a few.
[stammers] I grew up in Indonesia for a while, too. My mother married a guy from Jakarta.
You're a whole different type of motherfucker, B.
You do realize that, right?
I mean, I barely left New York.
Yeah, but-- I mean, it's New York.
Please. New York ain't shit.
Uh, how much?
That's two dollars.
Here you go, brother.
Ah, thank you, my brother. And I envy you for that one.
Why's that?
'Cause you 'bout to read that for the first time.
After you finish, slide back by and let me know how you liked it.
-Yes, sir. -All right.
Yo! Invisible!
-What's up, Ali? [chuckles] -Yo! You going by the courts today?
Yo, this dude got the ill baby skyhook. Like Magic.
-Gonna try. You? -For sure. Maybe 'round two.
-Cool. I'll catch you there. -All right then. Be easy, homeboy.
Like Sunday morning.
[preacher] "Can the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of a tyrant rescued?"
[preacher] Now what that means is, can we, the Lost Tribe of Israel,
reclaim what is rightfully ours from the cave-dwelling white devils
that raped our ancestors, stole our land,
and dispersed the true children of God across the globe?
-Read! -[woman] Hey!
I ain't... no devil. This is not the words of Jesus Christ.
Shut your mouth, cave bitch!
Yes, you are a cave bitch.
Do you know... what Jesus Christ called the white woman in the Bible?
A female dog.
And what is a female dog?
Don't be afraid to say it, brother. That's right. A bitch.
That's what Jesus Christ called you in the Bible.
[Barry] How come you're using a King James Bible?
-What? -[chuckles] Why that edition?
[stammers] I thought King James was a white devil.
Here's King James right here. Take a good look.
He looks like Billy Dee Williams if you'd ask me.
If you say so, brother.
Now, you might ask...
How did the Lost Tribes of Israel become lost? Well, I'll tell you.
[Saleem] How about her?
-No way. -Why not?
She's trying way too hard. Zero self-esteem.
-[Saleem] So she'd sleep with me. -[Charlotte] Um, probably?
-So that's a yes, then. -No. Big time no.
I don't think you understand the nature of this conversation, Charlotte.
I don't really think I want to.
Looks like your boyfriend's off on Pluto again.
Um... Ground Control to Barry. Oh, sorry. I was, um...
-I was thinking... -[Charlotte] No.
-[Barry] Nah. -[Charlotte chuckles]
-Hey, Will. -Hi, guys. What's up?
Hey, Willy. What's this? Buy one, get two free?
-[chuckles] -[Barry] You wanna join us?
Uh... No, thanks. I think we're gonna check out the band downstairs.
-Okay. Well, um, I'll see you around. -Yeah. See you, man.
So, what are you guys doing for Thanksgiving? Hmm?
Anybody here dig, uh, turkey tikka masala?
I'm going to Connecticut.
You guys are welcome to come with me.
You can meet the clown my sister's marrying.
Well, I love clowns. Let's go to Connecticut, Barry.
I'm, um... I'm allergic to Connecticut. I break out into these, um, gross white hives.
Uh-- Besides, I... I'm sure your, uh, family would love you showing up
with a Pakistani and a Black guy. Oh, well, you're not that black, Barry.
-[scoffs] -[Charlotte] No, seriously. They really wanna meet you.
Uh, I wanna meet them too.
But maybe we should do it on a more neutral ground.
Someplace with a lot of witnesses.
I'm gonna go talk to that girl with low self-esteem.
Look, my parents are gonna love you.
I'm sure some of their very best friends are Black.
They are, actually.
-I was-- -I know what you were doing.
The question is... why you feel the need to do it.
Look, I just really want to spend Thanksgiving with you.
Maybe we could do it here, a day early.
And then, I can go to Connecticut by myself if you don't wanna come with me.
[stammers] I'd like that.
[Saleem] ...from the campus.
-They're students. I'm not... really old. -[both chuckle]
[professor] Now, here we have, if you'd like,
a basic epistemological principle that we must bear in mind.
A genuine knowledge involves cognitive union
and overcoming our estrangement or alienation.
And this applies, I suppose, to all spheres of our knowledge.
I sometimes argue that, to be a good scientist...
So, I'm a little worried about Saleem being in charge of Thanksgiving.
I mean, can he even cook?
Everything about that man is a mystery, including these ingredients.
Uh, yeah, what is "ghee"? [chuckles]
And, um... [clicks tongue]
you may have gotten out of Thanksgiving with my family,
but that means I'm gonna have to take you to my sister's wedding. -[Barry] Hmm... -And you're gonna have fun.
-[Barry] Hmm... -And you're gonna have fun.
You know I'm gonna cause a scene at that wedding.
-Oh, really? -Mm.
Once folks get a load of my moves on the dance floor...
Be a miracle. [chuckles]
-[Ann] Aloha!-[Ann] Aloha! -Mom?
-Surprise! -[Saleem] Surprise!
You're supposed to be in Jakarta.
I had a conference in LA. Oh, my word. And here I am!
-Here she is! -My beauty.
[stammering] Uh... Mom.
-Uh... This is, uh, Charlotte. -Charlotte.
Hello. Such a pleasure to meet you, Mrs.--
Ann. Just Ann, honey. It's nice to meet you, too.
-Charlotte, some peas, please. -Mm-hm.
Barry, honey, do you have a salad bowl?
-Does this work? -How about a knife?
How about this?
-Not exactly Julia Child, huh? -Well, Saleem's sort of a child.
Oh, yeah? Well, you're sort of a poopy-head.
Is the atmosphere around here always so intellectually charged?
-Oh, yeah. -Well, you know, as a feminist,
I would never endorse this sort of retrograde patriarchal paradigm
that would paint you as a sort of domesticating, civilizing presence
-in this household. -Oh, no. Of course not.
But if I did, I would say that you have got your hands full
with these two knuckleheads. -[Charlotte chuckles] -Damn, Barry.
Your mom can talk some shit.
[Charlotte] So, do we get to hear some embarrassing stories about Barry or what?
I'm sorry to be dull, but I don't really have any.
He was so easy. Even his birth was easy.
I was 19 at that time, so that wasn't the easiest, and...
Neither was his dad, but what can I say?
Neither was his dad, but what can I say? He's my darling boy.
[Charlotte] What wasn't easy about his dad?
Barry barely talks about him.
All I know is that he's some kind of high-up government official.
I only met him once.
He showed up in Hawaii when I was ten and... tried to tell me how to live my life.
That's not true. He was around when you were little.
He's a lovely man. We just weren't well-suited for each other.
Mm, 'cause he had another family in Kenya, Mom. He lied to you.
It's a little more complicated than that. But we don't have to talk about it.
Okay. She always defends him.
You know what? He gave me you.
But Barry must've had some terrible haircuts, at least.
This is true. I used to cut his hair.
Mm. That's something no white woman should do.
Probably not.
Your mom is awesome.
Yeah, she's, uh... something, all right.
No, seriously... How many girls from Kansas end up working at the Ford Foundation in Indonesia?
How many girls from Kansas end up working at the Ford Foundation in Indonesia?
Well... first, you marry an Indonesian guy.
Then you... move to Indonesia and, uh, realize you need a job.
That's not fair.
Yeah. No... no, it's not.
What are you gonna do with her tomorrow?
Most of the rest of the world is having Thanksgiving.
I'm sure she'll have some ideas.
Is something wrong, honey?
No. I'm just thinking about the movie.
About you and the movie.
And what was it you loved so much? When you first saw it, I mean.
It was beautiful.
It was so exotic.
I'd never seen anything like it.
Like Dad?
-Your dad hasn't written, has he? -Why?
Well, he's fallen on hard times, I'm afraid.
What happened?
You know, it's all second-hand, but he's not working, and...
You know, it's all second-hand, but he's not working, and... When he's not working, he has a tendency to drink.
He invited me to visit.
That is fantastic.
Oh, honey, there's a whole part of you there just waiting to be discovered.
This isn't Roots, Mom.
Okay, now, this takes me back.
-Right on, brother. -[busker] ♪ To the New York island ♪
That is so corny, Mom. ♪ From the redwood forests To the Gulf Stream waters ♪
How are you, Barry?
How are you, really?
-Honestly? -Yeah.
I don't know. [scoffs]
Well, sometimes, I feel like I wanna...
breathe in everything New York has to offer.
Just make it all mine.
Just... And other times, it all seems like one... big distraction.
People seem like distractions. [scoffs]
I feel like I could... just...
stop talking and... I don't know, just...
disappear.
And become a monk. And, uh, read and write, and... think for a year.
Don't do that.
You know, every time I open my mouth in class, it's like...
I'm supposed to speak on behalf of all Black people.
Meanwhile, I, uh...
I quit going to Black Student Union meetings
because [stammers] I didn't feel like I belong there either.
The world is a big place, honey.
You'll find your way.
Come on, now. Oh!
Go up, big man! Go up.
Come on, and let's see. Let's see.
-Oh! -That's a good-ass turn.
Ladies and gentlemen, young Ralph Ellison in the house tonight!
I know you can't see him.
Uncover your eyes, he already invisible.
[PJ] Oh, my goodness. [man 3] That's what I'm talkin' about, baby!
[PJ] That's the reason they call him the Invisible Man.
[Saleem sighs] Okay.
[sighs] Let me give you some real-deal Saleem advice.
You want to impress her parents?
Order for her. Don't ask her what she wants, just, um...
[imitating Barry] I'll have the lobster and a magnum of your finest champagne.
And the lady will have, uh... a salad, with a glass of water... with lemon.
[in normal voice] Or... how about whatever they ask you,
you start every answer with, um, "Shit, motherfucker."
So... "Barry, New York must be quite the change from Hawaii."
"Shit, motherfucker, it sure is!"
"[stammers] Have you started to think about the summer yet, Barry?"
"Shit, motherfucker. I'm considering taking an internship at a law firm."
These are, uh... They're all great ideas.
-Damn it. -Here, here. Let me.
You know, there's a lot about me that you don't know, my brother.
For example, I used to work at a bank for almost two years.
And I never, ever-- Watch your chin. Robbed the place. There.
-[grunts] Another beer for Daddy. -Thanks.
Would you hand me a towel, please?
-Here you go. -Thank you.
[Charlotte] Oh, there he is.
-Bill Baughman. Pleasure to meet you. -Uh, Barry.
-My wife, Kathy. -It's so nice to meet you.
-We've heard so much about you. -It's a pleasure to meet you.
Barry, I feel we're at a little bit of a disadvantage
because Charlotte got to spend the whole day with your mother
and all we get with you is a dinner.
Also, Barry's mother is way cooler than you two could ever be.
[Bill] Oh, I don't doubt it.
Well, I'm prepared to make the most of the time we do have.
I mean, I'll eat two entrées, if I have to.
You, um... You know, I have to admit, it's, um...
It's kinda strange for me to be at the Yale Club.
I'm from a Harvard family.
-I didn't know that. [scoffs] -That... makes two of us?
Yes, sir. My, uh, father did his Ph.D. in Economics there,
on a full scholarship, as a matter of fact.
-Well, he must be brilliant. -Oh, he is something.
I mean, Dad was born in Kenya.
And he and my mother met when he was studying at the University of Hawaii.
The program that brought him over was, uh... was funded by the likes of, uh...
Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier, uh, and the Kennedys.
How remarkable. And, uh, where is he now?
Uh... Dad's back in Nairobi.
[chuckles] I believe his title is Senior Government Economist.
-Hmm. -[Kathy] Such a fascinating country. Are you able to visit often?
I plan on going soon. Well, as soon as, uh...
Charlotte teaches me a little more Swahili.
Oh... after I finish teaching him about New York City politics.
-That could take a while. -And some alcohol.
Well, uh... I hear you're something of a political organizer, Mr. Baughman.
Oh, no. I wouldn't say that.
I've arranged bail for some organizers. Represented the unions for years.
But nowadays, I spend more time raising money for candidates.
It's not something I particularly enjoy, but...
it's more important than ever.
Pretty soon, our only real game plan might be to outspend the bad guys.
Oh, and, uh, hope all that money doesn't turn everybody into bad guys. Hmm.
-Something like that. -[Charlotte] Oh, come on, Dad.
I've seen those pictures of you
and your ponytail marching for civil rights.
-Sure, but everybody did that. -Oh, not everybody.
Of course, not everybody. But everybody we knew in our little...
liberal enclave.
So, how'd your, uh, parents... feel about your, uh, you know, "little liberal enclave"?
Mine... not so good. Bill's...
Worse. [sighs]
But, you know, without their support, I don't know if I'd have had the courage
to spend my career fighting the good fight.
I might've gone corporate. Who knows?
Now, I've got a good friend who's making that decision right now.
He's from the Grant Houses, if you, uh, know where those are.
-No, I don't believe so. No. -Harlem.
It's one of the biggest public housing projects in the city.
Now, he says he, um, didn't make it to Columbia not to earn money.
Well, that's very understandable.
Yeah. I don't know. It's, um... I think he's gonna be miserable.
But, hey... [chuckles] But what do I know?
Aside from that fact that these lamb chops sound amazing.
[Bill] Mm, well, I couldn't agree more.
-Can we give you a lift back to school? -Uh, no, thanks. We're going downtown.
-Oh, we are? -Yes. You... need to dance.
-You think-- -You think you need to teach me. -I need to teach you? -[chuckles] Are you kidding?
-I need to teach you? -[chuckles] Are you kidding?
-That girl was positively afraid of you. -I wasn't...
Hey, good evening to you two lovely lovebirds. Y'all had a good night?
-Mm-hm. -Great night.
You got a square, college?
-Uh, it's my last one, boss. -Come on, give me a bust-down, then.
Keep it. One of these days, I'ma make you buy me a pack. -[Charlotte chuckles] -[Milton] Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What you just try to say to my mans?
You gonna make him? -Who the fuck is you, nigga? -[bottle shatters]
Coño! Relax, Milton!
[Milton] Now, who the fuck said you could walk down my block?
Yo! This kid is cool, Milt.
-Chill out, bro. -He don't look cool to me. -Nigga look like a motherfuckin' pussy. -Man, I live here.
-Nigga look like a motherfuckin' pussy. -Man, I live here.
Fuck you. You... ain't from here.
[stammers] I didn't say I was from here. I said I live here, okay?
-One forty-two. -I'm from here! -You understand? Born and bred. -Okay, that's great.
-You understand? Born and bred. -Okay, that's great.
-You understand? Born and bred. -Okay, that's great. -Good for you. -The fuck is you're walking away from me?
-What you gonna do now, nigga? -Yo, yo!
Yo, Milt! Chill out, man. Yo, put that away!
Yo! Mira, don't do some shit you gonna regret!
Go on, man.
Where are you taking me?
Hey, brother, you got some of that, uh, Egyptian Musk?
-[reggae music playing] -Incense or oil? -[Barry] Uh, oil. -[sniffs]
-One, three, five. -I'll take a three.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
You like that?
Hmm. That reminds me of my friend, Idris. He always used to wear Egyptian Musk.
Hey, uh, try this. It's called Black Love. Drives the sisters crazy.
[stammers] I'm good, thanks.
-Who's Idris? -From junior year abroad?
-He goes to Emory. -Right.
[man] Good day, Miss Lady.
-Hello. -How are you?
Hey, my man. Good to see you.
How did you like that Du Bois I hit you with?
Deep. What else you got for me?
Let me see here. I think I know just what you need.
-How about this? Ralph. Invisible Man. -I already read it.
Oh. I'm impressed.
-You know, he lives not far from here. -Oh, yeah?
Yeah. We've been waiting on a sequel for a long time.
Maybe he said everything he needed to.
He might've dropped a little too much truth for them in this one, baby.
Oh, I love this book. Have you read this?
Ah, you got good taste, Miss Lady. James Baldwin.
-Thank you. -No, I haven't.
-I'm buying it for you, then. How much? -[man clicks tongue]
-Um, that's on me. -Thank you.
-That's so sweet. -My pleasure. Yeah.
You guys enjoy your day.
No, thank you.
Hey, can we have lunch at Sylvia's?
-Where is that? -You've never been to Sylvia's?
No, Charlotte. [stammers] I've never been to Sylvia's.
Trust me, you're gonna love it. It's right over there.
-[preacher] Men far away. And there... -Yeah. Sylvia's it is.
-...in the midst of this land. -[reader] And he cursed Canaan.
-Ten bucks for a plate of fried chicken? -It's so good, though.
I guess these people don't mind.
In here stuffing their faces while folks panhandle right outside.
-That's any restaurant. -M&G, six blocks away.
-That's any restaurant. -M&G, six blocks away. Same menu, it's four bucks a plate.
Are you mad at me or something?
Have you noticed you're the only white person in here?
No, I'm not.
-And besides, why does that matter? -Nobody's looking at you.
They're looking at me.
Uh, the brother with the... uh... white girl on his arm.
Who?
Who? Who, Barry?
You don't see it.
-So show me. -I can't.
[scoffs] You're not used to being visible. "Visible"?
I'm a woman. You think I don't get stares? Catcalls?
-[stammers] That's not what I mean. -And besides,
I thought the whole problem was being invisible.
[waitress] You all ready to order?
You wanna come up?
No, I have... I think I'm gonna go play some ball.
-I'm sorry. -It's okay.
-Call me later? -Yeah, I will.
I love you.
Thank you.
[man] Uh... Brick.
Hey, yo, Invis, you should come out with us tonight.
What's on the agenda?
-Your girl Tisha's having a thing. -Tisha? Really?
You don't need to be taking Invis to nobody ghetto-ass house party.
-Why not? -Why not?
Hey. This motherfucker's from Indonesia and Hawaii and shit, man.
You know what them niggas like, bro. -Take him to a luau or somethin'. -[all laugh]
How's a brother supposed to get culture?
Y'all serious?
Whatever. Maybe y'all see, man.
"Thank you"? What are you, Han Solo or some shit?
Han didn't say "thank you." He said, uh, "I know."
'Cause that's the coolest way to say it. Sure.
I fucked up, huh?
Well, if you love the sister, you did.
Why would she say it, then? After the worst two hours of our whole relationship? [PJ] Hmm.
Let me think. That's exactly why. Look...
If she says it to you again, you either gotta say it back or walk off.
[man] There he is.
-[PJ] My man. -[man] It's about time.
[man] Thirsty?
-Hell, yeah. -Let's crack these babies.
-[man mimics fizzing sound] -[Barry] What's up, man?
[man] All right.
That's good.
Look alive, Invisible.
And welcome to this episode of "Project Safari."
Now, in the projects-- Excuse us, ladies.
In the projects, the elevators go out all the time.
Now, if you're somebody like my man, Mr. Jim here--
-How you doin', Mr. Jim? -How you doin', boy?
Or if I'm some old lady with grocery bags
and I'm trying to get all the way up to the tenth floor, you're wondering...
-how do you get up there? -You ask a nice young man for help.
If you can find one.
Hell, you sit your ass down on a bench and wait for them to fix them shits.
Hell, yeah.
All right, now. Right through here,
we have what you call the "pissy staircase."
For obvious reasons. I'm sure one of your five senses has picked up as to why.
Now, I would advise you not to touch nothin'
'cause you could get the itchies and scratchies.
It's hard to get rid of that.
So...
You wanna see some more, you wanna go to the party? What you wanna do?
-More. -More?
Come on, man, I got ladies waiting for me.
You know damn well ain't nobody waiting on you.
[chuckles] He lying. Come on, we'll see y'all later.
Come on, B. Right this way. Now...
The projects ain't all fun and games. Matter of fact, far from it.
But you do gotta keep a sense of adventure.
That's why police hate coming up here
because you'll never know what's behind door number one, behind door number two...
Matter of fact, you... you know what a "shooting gallery" is, B?
Well, take a look behind door number three.
It ain't for guns.
Then you got motherfuckers like me.
Same environment, same everything. And what the fuck, right?
But, I guess life is what you make it.
One thing to remember, though, through all of this.
This is government housing.
This is how the government does our people.
So, this concludes our episode of "Project Safari."
I've been your host, and I need another beer.
This one is gone. Excuse us.
Right this way.
[PJ] All right!
How you doing? You look amazing.
So, what you think?
It's beautiful.
Whatever you say, B. Enjoy yourself, though.
-[Lila] Hey. -Hey.
-How you doin', PJ? -I'm good, Ms. Denise.
-I'm fair for a square. How you doing? -Good.
Yo, Invisible! Come over here, come over here, come over here.
I got some people I want you to meet. This is my girl Tisha, this is her crib.
-Barry. -Welcome, yeah.
[PJ] This is Lila. Keep your hands off.
And Ms. Denise.
-Barry. Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you, too.
Wanna dance?
Sure.
So... where are you from?
I live on 109th and Amsterdam. You?
-Heaven? -[both laugh]
Eighth floor.
What's living on the eighth floor like?
[laughs] Well, it's pretty much exactly like this. Why, you wanna see it?
I wanna see everything.
-So... why do they call you "Invisible"? -It's because I'm spying.
I probably shouldn't have told you that, but I'm getting a good vibe.
-You seem trustworthy. -Who do you work for?
I'm freelance. Sometimes I spy just for my own, um, edification.
[giggles] I think that's called a Peeping Tom.
Oh, shit!
-What the fuck, Reggie? -That's my girl you talkin' slick to.
-Why are you over here? -Who is he? -That's my friend. -Who is he?
-Yes. -Oh, yeah?
I love truth, man.
Yo, Barry. Come over here.
Come here, my man.
He's drunk.
-What's wrong? -What happened to your face, B?
-Some asshole hit me. -I'll get some ice.
Who hit you? What'd you do to get hit?
Here, use this. It's cold.
That-- That was supposed to be for your face.
[Tisha] Whatever.
-I gotta go. -No, you don't gotta go.
-Sit down. -Nah.
This ain't my scene.
[woman] Hey! You looking for a date?
[guard] Hey. Hey.
-You got some ID? -I'm a student here.
[guard] ID.
-No, I don't have to show you anything. -You giving me a problem?
-We got a problem here? -Well, I don't see you ID'ing them.
So, what's so special about me, huh?
-I'm gonna ask you one more time-- -[Thad] Hey! Hey, it's cool.
I know this guy. He goes here. He's a student. It's all right.
It's okay.
No open containers.
Jesus, man. What, are you trying to get arrested or what?
I'm trying to mind my own fucking business.
Okay, whatever, man. Let's just get you home.
You drink a beer in front of him [stammers] and he doesn't do shit.
I walk on the campus, and I'm a criminal? What's with that, huh, Thad?
I don't know man. I'm fuckin' hammered right now.
Whoa, whoa. -What happened to your face? -Somebody punched it.
-I'm not that surprised. -Oh, fuck you. -[chuckles] -You got another beer?
-[chuckles] -You got another beer?
-You sure that's a good idea? -Yes, I am.
All right.
Thad.
You know why everything's about slavery?
Why, Barry?
That's why you're an asshole.
You're all right, Thad.
You're an asshole...
but you're all right.
Hey, it's 1981, dude! Get over it already!
[softly] Charlotte.
Charlotte.
[softly] Hi.
-Oh, my God. You're bleeding. -I don't want to talk.
-What happened to you? -It's nothing.
Where were you tonight?
At a party. In Harlem. Your favorite place.
I'm going to clean you up.
-Here. -Don't.
Stop.
What's the matter with you?
Why do you like me, Charlotte?
What do you mean?
-I like you 'cause I like you. -No. Really. Why do you like me?
Who wouldn't like that guy?
That's not me, Charlotte.
It was a joke.
Just because you went to Kenya for five days,
doesn't mean you understand who I am.
You know what your problem is, Barry?
You think that this... is all about you.
Good night.
-[Will] What happened to your face? -I don't wanna talk about it.
Man, listen, um...
one of the guys at Robbie's suite just moved out, so...
there's a room open.
-You should take it. -Are you sure? I...
I know you can afford the rent by yourself.
-I just thought-- -I'm ready for a change anyway.
Yeah.
I can move in with Saleem.
I just feel isolated from campus, you know?
It's cool, Will. I get it.
-We'll still hang out, right? -Yeah. Of course.
[Saleem] Barry, my brother.
We live in a shithole, you know that?
I mean, an actual place for shitting.
All afternoon, I am watching
white people bring their dogs here to shit.
And they just walk away. [chuckles] They just leave the shit.
Look, look, here comes another one now.
Hey! Clean up after your filthy animal, you filthy animal!
Bedtime for Saleem. Come on. Come on.
Come on.
I like that girl Charlotte, Barry.
[stammers] She called a bit earlier.
She said she was gonna pick you up at noon for the wedding.
-Hey, Barry? -Yeah?
You're becoming a real bore.
-Hello? -[woman] Barry? Is that you?
Yes. Who's this?
Yes, Barry, this is your Aunt Jane, in Nairobi. Can you hear me?
Uh, barely. I'm sorry, my aunt who?
[Aunt Jane] Aunt Jane.
Listen, Barry, your father is dead. He is killed in a car accident.
Hello? Can you hear me? I said your father is dead.
Please call your uncle in Boston and tell him.
I cannot talk now, okay, Barry? I will try to call you again.
Okay, so, don't laugh, but I'm thinking of taking a job on Wall Street.
Daddy's got some friends. I'm just sick of being broke, man.
It's getting lame. What do you think?
Oh, that's it?
No "you'll fit in great with the rest of those cokehead assholes"?
No "if you actually stood for anything, I'd call you a sellout"?
Ah, you're becoming a real bore, have I mentioned that?
[Charlotte] It's like musical chairs or-- I mean, you turn 25, the music stops, and whoever you're dating, you marry?
I mean, you turn 25, the music stops, and whoever you're dating, you marry?
It's not just my sister, either. It's all of her friends--
I don't see them for a few months, and then, bam,
they show up with rocks on their fingers and some random guy in tow.
And it's like, "Wow, what a coincidence."
You all just happened to meet your soulmates within six months of each other?
What are the odds?"
Hey.
You feel really far away.
Sorry.
Not what I meant.
Do you hate weddings or something?
No, I've never even been to a wedding,
except for my mother's.
Well, would you ever want to get married?
I don't mean now. I don't even mean to me.
I just mean... is it something you could see yourself doing someday?
No, it's, uh, not an institution I put much faith in.
I mean, my parents were married five times between them. Or six.
And I'm not even sure about my father.
Well... are you nervous about meeting my family?
-Why? Do I look nervous to you? -No.
You look like you're going into battle.
[photographer] All right, big smiles!
Now, hold it! Hold it! One more. Just one more.
Come on.
Great. All right, all the fellas.
Yeah, Barry, come. Come join us.
-You stand with Martin, here. -[woman] Hello.
Hey, George.
There's the man.
-Yep, okay. -It's kind of an uptight crowd, huh?
I'm kind of an uptight guy.
Great! Now all the ladies.
[photographer] Ready?
[Ephraim] It's the second time this week. The second.
Listen, you have to take it easy. You know they're not like back home.
Hello, sir.
-Can I get you something? -No, no. I'm just, um, I'm killing time.
How you guys doing today?
Fine, sir.
-My name's Barry. -Fred.
Ephraim.
-Where you guys from? -We are Ugandan.
I thought so.
My, uh... father is from Kenya.
Here you go.
Yeah. He...
He died recently.
My condolences to you and to your family.
Mine as well.
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah. It was today, actually.
I, uh... I got a phone call this morning from, uh, from an aunt I never met.
Actually, you know what? [stammers] I will have a drink.
-What do you got back there? -It's a full bar, sir.
I'll have a vodka.
Cheers.
-How you doing? -[chuckles]
-Yeah, this is my boyfriend, Barry. -[man] Oh, hi.
-Barry. -Good to meet you.
-Barry, this is Donna. -Barry.
-Ted. -Barry.
-And Emily. -Pleasure.
-Oh, and this is my cousin, Melissa. -Barry.
Hey.
Barry, there's someone I'm dying to introduce you to.
-Just when I thought I'd met everyone. -Hmm.
Barry, meet James and Grace Lee.
Two of the most brilliant, committed writers and activists
-I have ever had the pleasure to know. -Well, I'm honored to meet you.
Grace Lee tried to convince Malcolm X to run for Senate in '64.
-It almost worked, too. -[Barry] Wow.
I thought you might want to meet them. Especially because of your parents.
[James] Have a seat, Barry.
Are your parents in the movement?
Uh, no. Not really.
They're, uh, different races. I'm guessing that's what Kathy meant.
Ah, I see.
[stammers] My mom's from Kansas, and my dad's from Kenya.
I've only met him once, though.
I grew up in Jakarta and Honolulu,
and spent a little time in California, then, well, I ended up here.
That's some kinda gumbo.
You know what that makes you, young brother?
No, sir. [stammers] I don't. I really, really don't.
It makes you American. And you don't ever have to choose.
You know, I see you both sitting here together, in love.
-Yes, sir. -And full of wisdom.
And I can't help but think that...
the two of you must have been through all kinds of hell together.
Doing what you've done. And looking how you look.
You take the baton from the ones who've come before,
and you carry it as far as you can. And then you hand it off.
That's life. A beautiful struggle.
Hey.
Dance with me.
[Barry] "Dear Dad,
I am sorry it has taken me so long to write you back.
I have thought of you and your invitation to visit every day.
Sometimes I feel that there's a part of me I do not know,
and when I am feeling optimistic,
I find myself believing that you hold the answers I am looking for.
My journey so far has not been as dramatic as yours,
but I'd like to think I can imagine what you felt when you arrived in Hawaii.
Perhaps even what you felt when you met Mom.
I suppose I have spent these last months in New York trying to find my way.
Maybe that is all any of us do.
I look forward to discussing these things with you, Dad.
It is high time we got to know each other.
Love, Barack."
Hey.
You wanna play Horse?
-Sure. -You can shoot first.
Oh, okay.
Woo! Nice one.
I got an H.
-Right here. -Okay. [laughs]
Pretty good. Good. Guess I'm up.
Where you from?
Who are you?
Shinta.
Painkillers are by the sink.
Thank you for everything.
Not the first time, is it?
It's been three years and you still haven't changed.
Reckless.
And stupid.
Come here.
It's time for you to explain...
where you went off to...
and who the hell that kid is.
It's better if you don't know, Shinta.
-It's for your own good. -You bastard. For my own damn good?
-I want to keep you safe. -You want to keep...
I thought you were dead.
We all thought you were fucking dead!
I'm here. I'm right here.
No!
I didn't know what to do with you.
So, I gave someone a call.
Try to sleep. Get some rest.
If you weren't so ugly, I would've punched you in the face.
Sorry.
Why?
Why are you doing this?
You had a solid spot with the Triad.
Three years with the Triad and you throw it all away for a kid?
Why?
You would've done the same.
So, what's our plan?
There is no "our."
I need my money. Get new identities for me and the kid.
Then I'll leave.
You? On your own?
You're dealing with the Triad here.
I don't want to get you, Shinta, or the others involved.
And don't tell the crew of my presence.
What crew?
Adam, Dewo? Dead.
Abdul, Moses?
Life sentences.
Nobody stays on top forever.
-The only ones left are me and-- -And who?
Wisnu.
Wisnu!
My cousin.
He hero-worships you.
Morning, sir.
Ito...
-The fuck you come back for? -Drop it, Bob.
What's up? You still beefing with me?
You...
You abandoned us, Ito.
You fucking bastard!
I fucking served the Triad for your freedom!
Remember who fucking dealt with them, you junkie!
You fucking done now?
-Satisfied? -Your foot, Bobby...
The Triad must've alerted the local goons by now.
And you got a long list of enemies, Ito.
Who the fuck do you have left now?
Just this once, trust us.
You guys have no idea what I've been through.
Where is he?
Arian.
They stationed him over at Macau.
Let's hope he won't be involved in this mess.
Big brother, what's the matter?
Mainland bitch can't even pour wine properly.
She ruined my good pants!
How are you gonna make up for it? Goddamn bastard.
My most humble apologies.
You are our esteemed guest. I will arrange for our most prized wine.
Be a good boy and pour it yourself, little brother.
If you'd offered this sooner, we wouldn't have had any damn issues.
Get that through your head, you dirty foreigner.
Back off, bastard!
I'll kill her!
I'm warning--
Look at me.
-Clean up her wounds. -Understood.
Kid, what took you so long? Remember me?
Apologies. I was preoccupied.
Let's get off this ride and take a walk, shall we?
Take care of this Ito business,
and all this could be yours.
Okay, Reina. Hold it.
Done. Looks good.
What are you smiling for? Go work on the passports.
These are all I've got.
Fatih, are these necessary?
You want to cash in, don't you?
-Let me tell-- -I'll be the one who tells him!
-Yeah, fine, you tell him. -It was my fucking fault, Fatih.
Just let me tell it this time.
Maybe you remember him. He was my fucking errand boy!
Yohan, you fucking cunt.
After you and Arian left, we went downhill.
Yohan snatched our remaining hard cash.
Made his own empire dealing junk from his meat locker.
You want the cash? He's keeping it.
Tread carefully, Ito.
I heard he got promoted. He became Triad's red stick.
-Fatih. -Ito.
I've booked the boat for you and the kid. It's all in your hands now.
Take care, friend.
You, too, Fatih.
Anything I can help with? Meat orders?
You're Yohan, right?
ITO'S IN JAKARTA. REPORT IF SEEN. I'm here for my cash, Yohan.
You have a familiar mug.
Can you be more specific? We have tenderloin...
We also have--
If you know who I am, don't waste my time, Yohan.
Understand?
Fucking bastard!
That fucking hurt!
Chill, man.
Ito, you used to be the craziest motherfucker in the harbor.
I wanted to be in your crew.
But now, shoving a fucking gun to my head...
shows that you haven't been told
who's a fucking lion and who's a cockroach here.
You fucking talk too much.
Tell your little shits to bring my cash, and fast.
You see, the Triad has their Six Seas...
I got my Seven Butchers.
Seven?
Back off! All of you back the fuck off!
Motherfucker!
Motherfucker! Fuck you, you scheming Chinese fuck!
Ito, where the fuck are you, you fucking asshole?
Who did you call?
Chill, you asshole! You want your money, right?
On the table.
Now answer the damn question.
You fucking shit!
Answer.
Idiot! You came here for some chump change.
You didn't know? He is coming for you!
All my boys are headed to Fatih's place, asshole!
Who is "he"?
Who the fuck are they?
Who told you?
In there.
Answer, Ito. Damn.
-What's up? -We need to talk.
Go with her. Get some food for the kid. I'll tell you later.
Shinta.
Can you stay with your family for the time being?
Is this about the whole mess we're in again?
-Is this about Ito? -Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Let's go.
What is it?
You, take the stairs.
Okay, honey. Off you fucking go. Don't bother coming back.
Fuck off! It's over between us. Leave!
Enough.
-Shut up! -We kill him first!
Yo!
Who the fuck dares to step foot in here?
Bobby. Bobby...
Any fucking idea whose turf you're on?
-Who is this fucking white dickhead? -What's that?
You don't have a fucking clue who I am?
Let me introduce myself. I am White Boy Bobby!
Shoot me, motherfucker. Go ahead and fucking shoot me!
Bob! Bobby!
Bastard!
Bob...
Bob...
Let's fucking finish them off, Fatih. Let's fucking kill them all.
Here, Wisnu.
Hide in the room. Watch over the kid.
-Get in there! -Will do.
-Fucking gonna kill them all. -Bob... Bobby.
-We'll wipe them out! -Bobby, snap out of it.
Snap the fuck out of it, Bobby!
Where the fuck is Shinta?
-Is she fucking safe? -Yeah, she's safe.
-You sure about that? -Yeah, Shinta's safe.
We fucking wiped them out.
Motherfucking assholes!
Fucking shit!
Attention, all units. There's been a shootout
at the Petak Sembilan apartment complex.
There are eyewitness accounts of disturbance and violence.
Most of the armed men are still in the apartment. All units in West Jakarta--
That's our jurisdiction. They'd be suspicious if we don't respond.
That Chinese guy said it's all under control.
All we have to do is bring this shithead in.
We don't have to lift a finger. Let them kill each other.
Just sit back and relax, man. Everything--
Shit.
Who gave you the orders? Who gave you the order, motherfucker?
Speak.
Yohan's men are all inside.
Thing is, none have come out.
Ito's crew must be giving one hell of a fight.
Too bad.
Kill everyone that comes out that door.
Understood.
-The rest of you, check the basement. -Yes, ma'am.
What the fuck are you still standing there for, huh?
Come the fuck at us, fucking bastards!
Go through the back.
None will be spared.
Fatih.
Gonna have to end this.
Don't worry about it, man.
Take care of the kid.
Bobby!
How dare you? You want to betray us?
Fatih.
Get in.
Yohan never knew where I lived.
What do you mean?
But you always knew...
-You've fucking gotten us killed! -Fatih.
-You ratted us out! -Give me a chance to explain, Fatih.
We could have a fresh start, Fatih.
Form a new crew here. I can arrange it all.
And you... You should be right there at my side.
Yeah, look at you.
Look at you.
Fatih, you have to understand...
the Triad didn't give me any choice.
Forgive me.
Fatih.
I understand.
Uncle Fatih, are you okay?
Get down!
Fucking bastards!
Fuck!
Reina, get down!
Here, let me have a look.
You okay, kiddo?
Reina.
You have to be brave now. I need you to do something.
Where's the damn kid?
What's your name?
Reina.
People call me Ito.
Uncle Fatih said your name was Baldy.
What else did Fatih say?
He said...
-no time for regrets. -No time for regrets.
He said it just like this.
Were they nice to you?
Auntie Shinta was nice, so was Uncle Wisnu.
Uncle Fatih was also nice and cute.
Uncle Bobby... he's weird, but he's very strong.
Yeah, he was invincible.
A show-off, huh?
Arian!
Yeah, who is it?
Don't you dare. Let him come.
Hey.
Sit.
You should know who he is by now.
Please...
Please don't kill Uncle Ito.
Not her.
Come on... finish this!
What are you waiting for? Just finish me off now.
You're Ito.
One of six men chosen by Triad
to guard the heroin, cocaine, and weapons smuggling route in Southeast Asia.
Otherwise known as the Six Seas.
That's all over. They want me dead now.
So it seems.
So why drag the kid into this?
She has no one else.
A bad strategy.
She has a higher chance of surviving being on her own.
The evidence speaks for itself.
Death shadows you.
Look at your friends, slaughtered in a losing battle.
Fuck you!
Don't you dare mention them again.
Your only remaining so-called brother now wants you dead.
I know.
I brought the carnage here.
For three years, I was their instrument of death.
Carried out countless massacres.
When you're a Six Seas, it's simple.
Never forgive. Leave no survivor.
My fate in life, to create death.
A whole village slaughtered,
just because a few of them stole from the Triad.
But then I saw it clearly.
A tiny glimpse of life, hanging by a thread.
Maybe, just maybe...
I can change my fate.
What are you doing?
That was it, the path of no return.
A bit too late to save her now.
I wasn't merely saving her.
I'm saving myself.
But if your plan is to kill me,
hurry up and fucking do it!
MODERN GENERAL DICTIONARY INDONESIA - MANDARIN Excuse me, sir.
You realize the danger you've put us all in?
You fucking realize it?
I've told you repeatedly that we don't deal in drugs.
-I'm sorry, Ito. -You have to quit using.
Stupid asshole!
Apologize to the crew.
Not me.
-All I wanted was for us to expand. -Not with the fucking Triad, Bobby.
Get out of here.
Now!
I know I fucked things up.
But we're fucking morons if we miss out on smack and coke.
It's a fucking huge markup!
You realize you've fucked us all up?
At least I don't get high on murder.
What the hell did you just say?
Who's the murderer? Tell me!
Ito...
You sure about this?
No time for regrets, Fatih.
Keep an eye on him.
Come on.
I told you I'm leaving by myself.
This ain't a vacation, Arian.
I'm not tagging along to keep an eye on you.
Remember, I'm a damn minority over here!
To tell you the truth, this ain't enough.
Maybe we need Bobby getting screwed by Triad.
Maybe this whole mess is meant to be.
Did you ever hear of the Six Seas?
Let's not go there.
Imagine us, from two piss-poor kids, to side by side with the elites of Triad.
Enough. These are dangerous people, Arian.
Just drop it, okay?
Aren't we all dangerous?
Fuck it. Let's toss the white boy to the ocean.
Make him suffer a bit.
Ito, you're there, right?
I never wanted it to end this way, Ito.
I tried to save everyone. Save Fatih.
Tell me...
Did you pry that phone off Fatih's dead hands yourself?
Or did your dogs do it for you?
You've got balls to say that, Ito, after all--
Arian, I got conviction.
What I'm about to do... I should've done a long time ago.
Fuck that, Ito. Fuck your bullshit.
Fatih, Bobby, they don't see the real you.
You don't get to mention their names anymore.
That's always been your play, hasn't it?
Playing the role of the big brother.
That's not who you are, Ito.
Let's just get this done with.
You. I'm only going to ask once.
Who the hell are you?
Those who sent me want you dead.
All of the Six Seas, followed by the one code-named Old Tiger.
The question is, are you still one of them?
How you answer will affect my next move.
Your friend, Arian.
He's being supported by another particular Six Seas. You know him.
Chien Wu.
They'll send people to kill Reina if I go there.
Give me a hand.
Protect the kid.
Then you'll have my word. You'll finish your mission.
It all has to end tonight.
Shit, I keep missing shots.
I'll make it this time. See? Was easy.
-Score's way off. -Up for another round?
Hey, you!
So, you're the famous Ito?
Some fucking balls, coming here by yourself.
You have a death wish?
If you know who I am...
then you should know, you'll be dying by the hands of a Six Seas.
If so...
have at me!
-Everything in place? -Yes, sir.
You guys, come with me.
-The rest of you, take the stairs. -Yes, sir.
Hey, you. You girls aren't coming?
Damn lesbian weirdos.
Get your guns ready.
Fuck!
Come on!
Who the hell are you? You protecting the little bitch?
You're going to regret that.
What? For calling her a bitch?
No. For wearing white.
Why didn't you try to help her?
Can't help the dead.
So, you know something about me.
Alma, fifth member of the Lotus.
Elena, you're number three.
Fuck, I always hated those silly rankings.
Well, I'd love to talk some more, but...
let's kill each other instead.
Ito.
You know I've just saved your neck, right?
Three years ago, we left through that door.
Parted ways with the others.
Ironic, isn't it?
Now look at us.
I am, Ito.
A Six Seas, huh?
I fucking crossed the oceans for you.
We can only plan our lives, Arian.
Where we end up, that's beyond our control.
I never wanted you to tag along.
You always had your own agenda, you treacherous fuck.
I have my demons.
And look at the price I have to pay!
It all ends here.
You fucking talk too much!
Fatih, Bobby, they're all dead because of you!
You fucking caused this, not me!
I'm just getting started!
Guess who's fucking replacing you as a Six Seas?
You're so fucking blind.
Chien Wu's been using you all along.
The only thing that awaits as a Six Seas is death!
Only death.
Like I told you...
I'm just getting started.
Arian.
That's all you've got, Ito?
Bastard.
Arian...
What are you waiting for, you fuck? Finish it.
Fucking kill me! Fucking kill me!
Do it.
Can't kill what's already dead.
What did you just say?
What the fuck did you just say?
Where are you going?
Ito.
Ito!
Just die.
What did I tell you about watching this stuff? It's a sleepover. What are we supposed to do?
It's a sleepover. What are we supposed to do?
Have a pillow fight?
OK, I'm gonna go get ready upstairs.
Pizza is on its way.
Be good.
Oh, have fun, ladies.
OK, Mia, I'm gonna be out of your hair in a minute.
Don't worry. I've got it all under control.

Can you keep it down? I'm trying to work.
You're writing a love song. I'm expressing my pain,
not that I'd expect a 12-year-old girl to know anything about that.
That's probably the pizza.
Just... keep it down, huh?
[girl 1] Speaking of songs, have any of you heard of the one
that kills you after you sing it?
-Oh, come on. -[girl 1] I saw it online.
Then it has to be real.
No, she's right.
Apparently these boys down in Milford tried it.
Two of them died,
like full-on tongues hanging out,
bones shattered, dead.
They make that stuff up so kids don't believe -everything they see online. -Prove it.
-everything they see online. -Prove it.
-No way. -What's wrong, Olive?
If it's not real, there's nothing to be afraid of, right?
You're serious.
What better way to prove it?

-It's not funny! -You should've seen your faces. It was totally worth it! [laughs]
Great.
-[girl] We didn't do anything! -[girl 1] It was not our fault!
[sighs] I'm late already. Are you guys gonna be OK?
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
Are you sure?
I can check out the circuit breaker.
[sighs] Oh, great. Thank you.
All right, I will see you guys in the morning.
Please be good for Mia. I love you, kiddo.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
-Bye. -[man] Let me go check out the breakers.
I told you it was just the breakers!
Alice.
What are you doing up?
I thought I heard something.
Something's up there.
There's no one else here.
Told you.
Come on.
-Give me the light. -No.
-Give me the light! -No!
-Give me the light! -No!
-Mia, wake up. -What is it?
Come on.
Stay back.
Crooked Man was here.
[Olivia] She could have come.
Things with your mom and me hadn't been that great even before everything happened.
I'm sure she'd love to see you when you get settled.
Do you ever see the other girls?
No one really sees Alice all that much.
I heard that... Charlotte was waitressing at the diner,
and the other one...
-Violet. -Yeah. She was working at a store in town.
She sure had the judge convinced.
Crazy little Olive.
The girl who killed her friend.
Six years is a long time, Livy.
People move on. They forget.
Mom didn't.
Welcome home, Olivia.
[woman] Crazy Olivia's back from the loony bin.
It's a small town. People talk.
Livy!
Whoa, Livy.
You scared me.
Is everything OK, Livy?
It's fine.
Getting settled, huh?
You um... You gonna be OK?
I'm just tired.
Leave it on!
Please?
Good night.
Leave it open.
Just a crack.
Sure, whatever you want.
Hey, I thought we'd go to the market, if you felt up to it.
I don't even know what you like anymore.
Mom used to make my eggs soft scrambled.
Well, I'll try.
I am trying.
Thank you.
After breakfast, do you think you can take me somewhere?
Sure. Anywhere in particular?
I'd love something to read that's not for 12-year-olds.
OK.
It's like they've never seen a pretty girl before.
You're Olivia Shaw.
Noah.
Becky Harris' brother.
Noah!
Wow. You're a... a cop?
What can I say? Family business.
How is Becky anyway?
She's down at Brown. She's a freshman.
So what's it like being back home?
[sighs] It's a little weird.
And then there's that.
Hey, would you like a selfie or maybe an autograph?
[girl] Murderer.
Thanks.
[exhales] Don't mention it.
You meet a new friend?
Dad, this is Noah. I went to school with his sister.
-It's nice to meet you, sir. -Likewise.
Well, listen, I really have to be going.
but if you need anything or any help with the local paparazzi,
I'm here.
I will.
It's good to meet you. Bye, Mr. Shaw.
See? I told you everything was gonna be fine.
[Olivia whispers] Dad, is that you?
[Mr. Shaw] What's going on?
[Mr. Shaw] Honey, it's OK, it's OK.
It's all right.
-[woman] Good night, Steven. -[Steven] Good night.
Hello?
Marilyn?
Someone there?
Hello?
Too much caffeine.
[Mr. Shaw] Well, shouldn't somebody come out here check it out?
An act of mischief?
It was a threat against my daughter!
Well, you know what? Forget it!
What'd they say?
They don't have the time or the resources to dedicate to something like this.
[sighs] It's OK, Dad.
You know what? I'm gonna go to the garage.
I might have a piece of wood big enough to cover that glass.
Promise me you'll just try to calm down.
When you have a daughter, you'll understand.
[woman on TV] Steven, who was 28, is described by his colleagues
as a hardworking and thoughtful young attorney.
A lifelong resident of Eastborough,
many remember Steven as a bright and ambitious student
who delivered pizzas while putting himself through law school.
who delivered pizzas while putting himself through law school. [man on TV] We'll talk with the man who saw it happen.
[man] There is no easy way to describe the loss of someone like Steven,
someone with such hope and promise for the future.
A light that shined so brightly, but could be snuffed out so easily.
Whatever problems Steven had in this world,
whatever demons he may have been facing,
we can find comfort and solace
in the fact that his soul is now in a better place,
a place where love and peace are eternal,
where there is no pain and suffering.
And we know that one day we shall be reunited with him,
in this glorious heaven.
"I lift up my eyes to the hills.
Where does my help come from?
My help comes from the Lord,
the maker of heaven and Earth."
In accordance with his wishes,
we now return Steven to the Earth,
which he enjoyed so much.
This must feel familiar for you.
You're gonna start that now?
It would've been her birthday today, you know that?
No.
Well, she's in a graveyard nearby if you wanna pay your respects.
I'm sure she'd love to hear from you.
I didn't do anything to her, and you know it.
Funny, because there was only one person holding the knife that killed her,
and it wasn't the boogeyman.
[Noah] Hey, hey, hey, forget it. They're not worth the aggravation.
You don't know what it's like.
Maybe not, but my bitch meter is pretty reliable.
Anything I can do?
[sighs] Is swatting Violet an option?
Maybe an anonymous noise complaint?
Actually, I could use a favor.
OK.
Can you give me photos of Steven's body?
Why?
Call it a hunch.
We already know what happened.
You know what the witness said.
My dad would have my badge.
[Olivia] It's important.
I won't say anything to anybody. I swear.
Hello, Jill.
Let her go! Let her go!
Mrs. Hutchinson.
The next-door neighbor called and said she thought
someone was trying to break into my house.
I'm so... I'm sorry. I didn't...
I thought the place was empty.
Haven't you done enough already?
I know what you're thinking,
and you have to believe me.
I didn't hurt Jill.
I heard all about the evil ghost man or whatever you said it was.
I'm here to find the answers.
You may have convinced everybody else that you're crazy,
but I know exactly what you are.
Hear that?
That is the sound of karma.
I'd leave before they get here, if I were you.
Did you just see that?
[exhales] Thank you, Noah.
That's not possible.
-This is Noah. -[Olivia] Jill. Six years ago.
The face, contorted body, it's the same.
[exhales] What if he came back?
Who?
[Olivia] The Crooked Man.
Olive, are you--
The lyrics said,
"Down your crooked paths, he follows."
-[woman] Here you go. -[Olivia] "Paths." Plural.
What if he's coming after everyone who was in the house?
[Noah] Look, you wanted to see photos, I sent you photos.
You want my advice? Drop it.
One more favor. Can you look up the file on Jill?
One more favor. Can you look up the file on Jill? -Olive... -I just want to see
-Olive... -I just want to see if she had any broken bones too.
I told you, Steven fell out a window. Just check.
All right, I'll think about it, but I gotta run, OK? OK.
Whoa.
Mrs. Larson?
[Mrs. Hutchinson] Help me!
Why are you digging up that old case?
I ran into Olivia Shaw at the Sanderson funeral yesterday.
She tell you how they found her standing over Jill's body?
Covered in blood, holding the knife that matched the stab wounds?
It says here the victim had multiple broken bones.
You don't think that was relevant to bring up in court?
Olivia pushed her down the stairs.
Yeah. What about the intruder Olivia said she saw?
We searched the property.
We questioned all the neighbors on the block. No one saw anyone.
You know, your sister was supposed to be there that night. Could've been her picture in that file.
Do yourself a favor, son. Stay away from Olivia Shaw.
Table four says they've been waiting five minutes for coffee. I'm on it, I'm on it. [sighs]
Can you do me a favor and refill number four?
OK, what can I get for--
I just need five minutes.
[Charlotte] I don't think so. I came to warn you.
I think the Crooked Man is back.
I saw a picture of Steven's body.
Whatever happened to him, it looked just like Jill.
Violet says I'm not supposed to listen to you. Charlotte...
She says you're dangerous and unstable.
She's just trying to protect herself.
Charlotte, do you really think I killed Jill?
[woman on TV] Eastborough Police are investigating the tragic death of Grace Hutchinson.
Our investigators say it initially looked like suicide.
They are not ready to make that claim just yet.
-Family and friends of Hutchinson... -[gasps] ...say there is no way this career woman and mother
...say there is no way this career woman and mother would take her own life.
Investigators say the tragic death of Hutchinson's teenage daughter...
[Charlotte] Olive, you're right. Everyone who was there that night is dying.
Where did you get that?
I just found it. It's targeting us, isn't it?
We need to let everyone know.
Toss your bike in the back. I'll drive.
We need to talk.
-I'm working. -Violet, Jill's mother died last night.
Let me guess. The boogeyman did it?
Kind of a coincidence, don't you think?
All of this happening just as I get back into town?
You're not actually listening to this, are you?
Steven's body...
it looked like just like what happened to Jill. Look at it!
What did happen to Jill, Olive?
You don't remember that night?
What I remember was a stupid, childish game,
and my best friend being found dead.
Look, you don't think I get it.
If I'm the girl who killed Jill, then none of this was your fault.
But if I'm right, and the Crooked Man is back--
What, Olivia? What do you suggest we do?
Go into hiding because you think something you did six years ago has come back to kill us?
Come on, you don't really believe this, do you?
Tell me, have you seen or experienced anything strange lately?
Does this conversation qualify? This is not a joke, Violet!
No, I haven't.
But if you're right, and if your little homecoming has somehow brought this thing back, then there's really only one answer, isn't there?
Leave. I have to get back to work.
Just--Just do me one favor, OK?
-Please stay out of the dark. -Olive, let's go.
It lives in the dark. Just make sure you're always in the light, no matter what!
[Charlotte] You're wasting your time.
-No one's seen her in years. -I'll be right back.
Who is it?
Olivia Shaw.
Alice isn't here.
Do you know when she'll be back?
She doesn't want to see you.
That's not what I asked.
-I think you should go. -Please!
It's really important that I speak to your daughter. [woman] Go away!
That didn't work.
Wait. So the babysitter's the last one? Assuming we even know how to find her.
Actually, that's an easy one.
[Alice] Mother?
Trust me. It's for your protection.
-This is taking way too long. -I know. Come on.
Excuse us, excuse me, sorry. Sorry. Gotta get through.
Please, please, our friend is in danger.
-[man] Go on in. -Thank you.
[man] You're good.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Mia Johanssen.

Anyone in there?
Excuse me.
You two can't take a hint. -Something's wrong. -Mia?

I can't comment on whether it was a suicide or not

-What are you doing? -Look at this.

There's gotta be at least 50 stories here: Suicides, homicides, disappearances.
"Crooked Man Uncovered?"
The original site was taken down.
But according to this, a lot of people had recited that rhyme.
I thought maybe there might be some information
on how to stop this thing.
Unfortunately, there's no contact information listed or anything.
-I have an idea. Come on. -Where are we going?
-The Crooked Man? -You've heard of it?
-The Crooked Man? -You've heard of it? Internet meme that kills people?
So can you find whoever put up that website or not?
All you have to do is put the domain into a Whois search, and you should get what you need.
Got a P.O. box in Leveritt. No name?
Looks like whoever did this wanted their privacy.
But that should be pretty easy for you to trace, right?
I thought you said this was going to be hard. We're cyber forensics. We can do anything.
All I have to do is go into the system, find out who registered the box, and...
It's been abandoned for three years.
-Great. -So back to square one?
Wait.
What--What are you doing?
Most computers automatically imprint their files with a level of metadata, such as who created them and where.

-You can't leave now! -[Violet] Look, Olive...
I'm sorry I told everyone you were crazy,
and I'm sorry I didn't support you all those years ago, but I am not going to sit around and wait to die!
This guy maybe will have some answers for us.
Is that gonna help Jill or Jill's mom or Mia?
All gassed up!
Violet's not coming.
What do you mean, she's not coming? We had a plan.
What if you're wrong? What if you can't stop it?
You think running will help? I do know staying here won't.
Come with me. You don't need to be a part of this.
Yes, I do. We've been hiding too long.
-It's your funeral. -Violet...
Violet.
Be careful. Please?
You too.
-Alice! -[Charlotte] Olive.
What are you doing?
Alice! -[Olivia screams] -[Alice] Grab my hand!
-Olivia, what are you doing here? -I need to talk to you.
You need to leave. It's not safe.
Alice... what happened?
Please go.
Not until I talk to you first. It's important.
These drawings...
You can't just come in here and go through my stuff.
-Alice! -It's private!
Alice, you're not alone.
I've seen them too.
We're being warned.
Look, there's a site I found. Dozens of cases just like ours.
-The Crooked Man? -Yes.
Noah had a friend at the police station track down whoever put the site up.
If they've been doing all the research, then-then maybe they know how to stop it.
It's too late. This is why I need you to come with me.
-I can't. -Alice...
Mother says never leave the house without her.
People are dying! She says I'm safe here.
Do you believe her?
Alice...
this could be our chance to finally fix what we did.
We can make things right.
I get carsick.
We'll crack a window. Come on.
♪ Caught a crooked mouse ♪ Olivia? You saw something, didn't you?
Olivia?
It's over here.
Hello?
Is anyone there?
Anybody?
-[man] What are you doing here? -[all gasp]
-Olivia. -How do you know my name?
You're very lucky.
Not many people have come face to face with the Crooked Man and survived.
You know about that?
Of course.
That's why you're here, isn't it? To find someone who can give you all the answers.
Let's start with what this thing is and where it came from.
In the 1800s, a writer researching legends and folklore
discovered dozens of different cultures in dozens of different languages,
all referring to the same thing.
He called it the Crooked Man.
Imagine a death sentence that no mortal could escape,
that no human law could pardon,
the eternal, unstoppable force bringing certain death to anyone who dare summon it.
bringing certain death to anyone who dare summon it.
It probably started as an tribal incantation.
A curse.
The words were translated and passed down through the ages, evolving with the times.
Over the years, it was transcribed and studied.
Part of it was even turned into a nursery rhyme.
Eventually someone put it online.
And with that, the proverbial Pandora's Box was out there.
The Crooked Man now belonged to the world.
You were the one that put it up on Creepyhollow.
Funny thing about the Internet.
You can take down content, but it never really goes away.
By the time I realized what was happening, that... that the Crooked Man was real,
it was too late.
I tried to get back online to warn people.
Four people in our town are dead!
And not a minute goes by where I'm not tormented by what I did.
I'm up in that sanctuary every day,
praying for the souls of the people I killed.
Now, ever since I came back...
The Crooked Man returned.
Why?
When you left, somehow you...
you paused the curse.
But now that you're back,
now that all who were marked have returned and reunited,
it's like you never left.
I tried to warn you.
I tried to get you to leave before he returned.
What are you talking about?
-The rock. -That was you.
But now it's too late.
What if she left again?
Too many people have died now.
He's coming for you.
There's no order, no rhyme, no reason.
Where there's darkness, he will be there.
But there has to be a way to stop him, right?
You can't.
He cannot be stopped.
You cannot hide,
and you cannot run.
If you have been cursed by the Crooked Man,
he will kill you eventually,
no matter what.
Keep it down!
[whispering] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come, thy will be done--
I-I thought you were sleeping.
-There's something I have to do. -Wait. Hey, where--
Wait a minute.
[exhales] No way.
Classical fairy tales?
-Ancient mythology? -Noah.
Your dad said you'd be here.
-What's wrong? -Can we go talk?
Yeah, of course.
Noah, what is it?
Noah, how do you have this?
Noah.
I have to tell you something...
about when we were kids. What?
The night of the sleepover?
The night Jill died?
I was there.
My sister was supposed to be there.
I was on my way home from basketball practice,
and I thought-- I thought I'd swing by and give 'em a little scare, you know.
But by the time I got there, I realized she wasn't there. It was too late.
And then when the lights went off, I got so scared that I would be seen, so I left.
I'm screwed, aren't I?
Noah, I am so sorry. I had no idea. But it's gonna be OK now, right?
Because you figured out where the website came from,
so you're gonna make it stop. Not quite.
That's encouraging. But I'm working on it.
So I am screwed.
Hey.
We're gonna fix this, OK?
I promise.
Yeah.
Noah, what is it?
You really don't see that.
It's him, isn't it?
What is he doing?
He's trying to get us...
but he can't.
It's the light.
As long as we stay out of the dark, we should be OK.
He's gone.
Come on. I have an idea.
"Only with this crooked song shall the Crooked Man yield."
At first, I thought it was talking about the rhyme itself.
Yeah?
But what if it literally means "song"?
What if this music box is the key to the whole thing?
Milo said there was a writer in the 1800s
who was doing research on old legends
and found out about the Crooked Man.
He found the music box,
and he accidentally summoned the Crooked Man.
If this box is out there,
we might be able to stop this thing.
All we have to do is find it.
What is it? We have to turn around. Now.
[Noah] Anything? Voicemail.
-Hope we're not too late. -Come on!
[Crooked Man] See you soon, Olivia.
[man] She didn't do anything.
Oh, I forgot.
It's the boogeyman, right?
Son, a word.
Olivia and I have been together the whole time.
[Police Officer] Five people are dead, Noah. She left three suicide notes.
You saw the body. You think she did that to herself?
Not exactly.
Please tell me you're not drinking the fruit punch.
-I know it sounds crazy. -You are a police officer.
-[Noah] I know what I saw! -OK. Here's what's gonna happen.
-You're not listening. -You're gonna take her down -to the police station, OK? -You're gonna arrest her?
-to the police station, OK? -You're gonna arrest her? I'm gonna come down there and talk to her as soon as I'm done here.
I'm gonna come down there and talk to her as soon as I'm done here.
Do you want me to have somebody else do this?
[Noah] No.
How could she have felt so helpless?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
I have no choice.
-[Olivia] Noah! -[Noah] Don't make a scene.
-You can't do this! -Just get in the car, please.
This is 4-30. Suspect in custody. 10-7 to station.
[man on radio] Copy that, Noah.
What are you doing? Noah!
Shh! We're alone now.
We got about 20 minutes until my father realizes where we're going.
I'm sorry.
So where do we go now?
Looks like a place a professor would live.
[woman] Well, it's always nice to meet some of dad's former students.
He always spoke so highly of you and your mom.
I thought, since we happened to be in the area,
that we should pay our respects.
Oh, you found Milo, I see.
He was my dad's teaching assistant for years.
Which--which class of his did you take again?
World Culture and Mythology.
Yeah. That was one of his favorites.
-Sugar? -No, thank you.
He always would tell the most interesting stories.
He would make you feel like you were right in the middle of it all.
It must've been amazing, growing up with a father like that,
all the stories he must have had.
To tell you the truth, yeah, he saved most of that for his students.
I can only imagine all the things he must have left behind.
I heard he had quite the collection.
You want to see it?
-[Olivia] Huh. -[Noah] Whoa.
[Olivia] Look at all this stuff.
Some of these items must be pretty valuable.
[woman] Yeah, well, you can't put a price on your father's memory.
[Olivia] I imagine not.
That was one of his more recent finds.
I remember him talking about it.
May I?
Who are you?
-We told you. -No.
First of all,
what, were you 12 years old when he still taught that class?
And second of all, he never would've spoken very highly of me.
Certainly not my mother,
so do you wanna tell me what you're really doing here?
Have you heard the rhyme about the Crooked Man?
[scoffs] Of course. My father wrote a book about the author.
We believe it's real.
After your father died,
Milo posted the means to summon him online.
Six people have died,
and unless we can figure out how to undo our mistake,
there will be more.
We believe this box might be the only way to stop it.
I'm gonna show you something.
Something that I have not shown anyone.
Not the police.
But when I--when I found my father's body in the classroom...
he had this.
We can end it.
For good.
We just need to borrow the box.
Please.
You get that son of a bitch.
[woman on TV] Noah Harris' black SUV
was reportedly seen early this morning heading north.
Harris and Olivia Shaw are being sought by police
in connection with last night's brutal slaying that--
I always knew she was trouble.
I always said it.
Hey!
Not at the dinner table.
Dear Lord, bless this food that we are about to eat
and all that it provides.
-Amen. -[Alice] Amen.
Looks like a storm is coming in.
[clears throat] Now... where were we?
-I am going to check the breakers. -No! I mean... I'll come with you.
I should get some candles.
You know, maybe it's-it's the whole block.
Maybe.
There's nothing there. There's nothing there.
Mother?
-Alice? -Mother, I can't open the door!
Alice!
Mother, are you OK?
I'm scared!
Mother? Is that you?
How 'bout a light?
I should've been there.
No, you can't blame yourself.
[Olivia] For six years, her mother tried everything she could,
and probably more than she should, to keep Alice safe.
Hey, she's alive.
How many people have died because of me?
Jill, Steven, Mia, Charlotte, Violet.
You're the one that's trying to save them.
He called my name.
What are you talking about?
Back at the house,
when I touched the music box, he called my name.
And it wasn't the first time.
This is all my fault. All of this.
-He's taunting me. -No, no, no, you can't think like that.
No, I killed them, Noah. I killed all of them!
You think she can hear me? She's in a coma because of me.
Don't you understand? Because of me!
[Noah] Come on, let's go.
-Don't you ever turn the light off! Ever! -She's just a little tired. Excuse us.
I'm the one who started it. I'm the one who needs to end it.
How?
[exhales] The music box, it showed me something.
A crooked house. I think that's where we have to find him.
Did it show you where it was?
Uh... All I saw were woods.
Think.
Were there any specific characteristics or landmarks? Anything specific?
Just a clearing.
But--But I did notice two large rocks and giant pine tree.
As if that even helps.
Actually, it does.
-Come here. Come here. -What are you doing?
Let's go, let's go.
[Noah] I was a cub scout when I was a kid.
One day my troop went for a hike through this park.
We found this clearing and two rocks.
Just like your vision.
You ready?
-[Olivia] For Alice. -[Noah] For Alice.
We're close.
We're here.
This is exactly what I remember.
The rocks, the trees.
[exhales] And the house was somewhere... right...
-Did you see-- -[Noah] No. That house was not there a minute ago.
So what happens now?
We kill the Crooked Man.
I'll go check the upstairs. Be careful.
[Noah] Olive!
Oh, God. You all right?
All right? You OK? Yeah.
-[Noah] What are you doing? -Making a call.

What do you want? Haven't you taken enough already?
Hey, hey there.
You should really see somebody about that posture problem of yours.
Is it working? Anything happening?
Yeah.
I saw that going differently.
What am I missing?
Hey! It's me again.
-Are you OK? -It's not working.
"Only with this crooked song." I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
We know that when you recite the poem, -it summons him, right? -Yes.
-it summons him, right? -Yes. And so the box must serve the same purpose.
-Right. -In order to reverse its effects and take him back, we've got...
To play it backwards! OK, OK!
-[Noah] Hurry up. -I'm going as fast as I can!
Whatever happens, keep playing.
Keep... playing.
Go back to hell, you son of a bitch!
You're alive!
Come on. We need to get out of here.
Come on, Noah!
It's over.
It's over now.
Finally.
[girl] That's so old school.
How about the one with the killer in the hockey mask?
what kind of sick individual names a street Edgewood Way
and he put it half a mile away from Edgewood Lane?
It's crazy.
You got me out here in this creepy, confusing ass suburb.
I'm serious, though. I feel like a sore thumb out here.
All right, baby. All right, I'll talk to you soon.
See you.
[sighs] Okay, so this is Rhine Ave.
[sighs] It's like a fucking hedge maze out here.
East...
Keep going straight and then I think it said a left on...
What was that? Peacock?
"Go straight and a left on..."
Okay.
All right, just keep on walking, bruh.
Don't do nothin' stupid. Just keep on...
Fuck this. I'mma fucking go the other way I came.
Not today. Not me.
You know how they like to do motherfuckers out here, man. I'm gone.
Yo... Come on, brother, this is-- Yo! Yo! Hey!
Sid, Sid, Sid. How's it goin' over there?
Good.
You got your toothbrush?
Check.
Do you have your deodorant? Check.
Do you have your cozy clothes?
Got that.
Can you give me a minute, Sid?
We gotta pry something out of your dad.
What?
Do they know... Do they know I'm black?
No.
Should they?
It seems like it's something you might wanna, you know,
mention.
"Mom and Dad, my black boyfriend will be coming up this weekend
and I just don't want you to be shocked
that he's a black man."
You said I was the first black guy you ever dated.
Yeah, so what?
Yeah, so this is uncharted territory for them.
You know, I don't wanna get chased off the lawn with a shotgun.
You're not going to. First of all,
You're not going to. First of all, my dad would've voted for Obama a third time if he could've.
Like, the love is so real. I'm only telling you that 'cause he's definitely
I'm only telling you that 'cause he's definitely gonna wanna talk to you about that.
-And it will definitely fucking suck. -[laughing]
But that's because he's a lame dad more than anything else.
They are not racist.
-All right. -I would've told you.
I wouldn't be bringing you home to them.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Think about that for, like, two seconds.
-I'm thinkin'. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.
No, no, no.
No, no, no. -Come on, I'm a grown man. -No way.
You broke my cigarette.
Seriously, you just threw it out a window?
Just like a dollar. You basically threw a dollar out the window. Great.
That was a dollar you decided to spend on nicotine.
-Yeah. -Tobacco.
Hold on, I gotta call Rod.
Oh, Rod.
Don't, don't do that.
'Sup?
Yo, you at work? [Rod] Yeah, yeah, I'm at work.
Look, Chris, tell me this, okay?
How can I get in trouble for patting down an old lady? It's standard procedure.
for patting down an old lady? It's standard procedure.
Gary just think 'cause an elderly bitch is elderly,
she can't hijack no motherfucking plane.
C, wait, wait, wait. I know you laughin'.
I'm serious, man. The next 9/11 is gonna be on some geriatric shit.
Straight up.
[laughing] Look, man, thanks for looking after Sid this weekend.
Remember, no human food.
He's got IBS. Damn, C. Give me some type of credit.
Okay, I don't forget shit. You do.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, all right. No, I accept your apology. It's all good.
No, I accept your apology. It's all good.
How Little Miss Rosie doin'? She's good. She's driving.
-Can I talk to him? -No.
I'd like to talk to him, please.
[sighs deeply] Hold on, hold on.
-Hi, Rod! -[Rod] Now, look here.
-Hi, Rod! -[Rod] Now, look here. You know you picked the wrong guy, right?
Yeah, of course I know that. This is all just a ploy to get to you.
-It's not too late for us. -Okay, get your own girl.
-Goddamn. -[Rod laughing]
She's all mad at you 'cause you never take my advice. Like what?
Like don't go to a white girl's parents' house.
What's she doin'? Lickin' your balls or somethin'?
-Yeah, bye. -[laughs] You know what I'm sayin', Chris?
Chris.
Chri--
This motherfucker hung up on me.
You're jealous. -I'm not jealous. -I made you jealous?
-I'm not jealous. -I made you jealous? -I'm not jealous of Rod. -[laughing] It's Rod!
Fuck. Are you okay?
Yeah, that scared the shit outta me.
-You? -Yeah, I'm okay.
-[Chris] All right. -Oh, my God.
Fuck.
-Stay here. -What?
What are you doing?
I don't know.
Well, maybe he's gone, you know?
Chris.
So, in the future, the number to call is Animal Control Services.
Yes. Sorry about that. I was just disoriented.
So you guys coming up from the city?
Yeah, yeah. My parents are from the Lake Pontaco area.
We're just heading up there for the weekend. Hmm.
Sir, can I see your license, please? Wait, why?
Yeah. I have state ID.
No, no, no. He wasn't driving.
I didn't ask who was driving. I asked to see his ID.
-Yeah, why? That doesn't make any sense. -Here.
No, no, no. Fuck that. You don't have to give him your ID
No, no, no. Fuck that. You don't have to give him your ID 'cause you haven't done anything wrong.
Baby, baby, it's okay. Come on. Any time there is an incident, we have every right to ask--
Any time there is an incident, we have every right to ask-- That's bullshit.
Ma'am...
[man on radio] Everything all right, Ryan?
Yeah, I'm good.
Get that headlight fixed. And that mirror.
Thank you, Officer.
What? That was hot.
Well, I'm not gonna let anyone fuck with my man.
-I see that. -Okay.
We're here.
It's the groundskeeper.
Are you ready?
[Rose] Hi! My little girl! Come here!
How are you? I love you, too. I missed you.
This is my dad, Dean. This is Chris.
Call me Mr. Armitage. [Chris] Of course. How you doin'?
I'm kiddin'! You call me Dean. And you hug me, my man.
-How are ya? -I'm good. How are you?
-We're huggers. -Yes.
This is my mom. This is Chris.
Hi, welcome.
Nice to meet you.
Your father gets really excited, but...
Anyway, yeah. I'm Missy.
-Yes. Come on in. Please, welcome. -Inside.
So how was your drive in? It was fine. We actually hit a deer.
It was fine. We actually hit a deer.
-What? -Oh, no.
-Is it dead? -Yeah.
That's horrible. Are you guys all right?
Yeah. It just fruck us out. It did?
[Chris] Yeah. It came outta nowhere. We got it pretty good.
Yeah, it must have frucked you out, big time.
Frucking weird. Well, you know what I say?
I say one down, a couple hundred thousand to go.
-Dean. -Dad.
No, I don't mean to get on my high horse, but I'm telling ya,
No, I don't mean to get on my high horse, but I'm telling ya, I do not like the deer. I'm sick of it. They're taking over.
I do not like the deer. I'm sick of it. They're taking over. They're like rats. They're destroying the ecosystem.
They're like rats. They're destroying the ecosystem.
I see a dead deer on the side of the road, I think to myself, "That's a start."
I don't even understand that. -I'm sorry. -I'm just sayin'.
You know what, I am grateful for what you've done today.
-[sighs] -I don't like 'em.
We got that.
-Okay. -Yeah.
All right, you guys look so wiped out.
-Yeah, a little. -Yeah.
So how long has this been going on? This...
This thang?
How long?
[laughing] Four months. Four months?
-Mmm. -Five months, actually.
She's right, I'm wrong.
Attaboy. Better get used to saying that.
Please, I'm so sorry.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. She's right, I'm wrong.
[snickers] See?
Does he have an off button? This is exhausting.
[Dean] I know. I wanna give you a tour.
-They just got... -Can we unpack first?
You wanna unpack? Before the tour?
This is Missy's office. She takes appointments in there.
She's a therapist, right? Psychiatrist, yeah.
Turns out people up here
are just as messed up in the head as they are in the city.
This is Jeremy.
That's Rose's little brother. There he is.
[Chris] I've heard stories.
[Dean] Yeah, I bet you have. He's studying medicine now. Wants to be just like his old man.
He's studying medicine now. Wants to be just like his old man.
-You'll meet him. -All right. Cool.
I picked these up in Bali.
It's pretty eclectic. I'm a traveler and I can't help it.
I keep bringing souvenirs back.
It's such a privilege to be able to experience another person's culture.
-You know what I'm saying? -Mmm-hmm.
Oh, you're gonna love this.
My dad's claim to fame.
He was beat by Jesse Owens in the qualifying round for the Berlin Olympics in 1936.
in the qualifying round for the Berlin Olympics in 1936.
-Those are the ones where... -Owens won in front of Hitler.
Yeah, what a moment. What a moment.
I mean, Hitler's up there with all his perfect Aryan race bullshit.
This black dude comes along,
proves him wrong in front of the entire world.
Amazing.
Tough break for your dad though. Yeah.
He almost got over it.
That's the basement. We had to seal it up.
We got some black mold down there.
My mother loved her kitchen, so we keep a piece of her in here.
Georgina, this is Chris. This is Rose's boyfriend.
Hi.
Hello.
[Dean] The garbage goes under the sink,
and now for the pièce de résistance...
The field of play.
I love it. The nearest house is across the lake.
It's total privacy.
I know what you're thinking.
What?
Come on, I get it.
White family, black servants.
It's a total cliché.
I wasn't gonna take it there.
Well, you didn't have to. Believe me.
No.
We hired Georgina and Walter to help care for my parents.
When they died, [stammers] I just... I... I couldn't bear to let them go. I mean...
I couldn't bear to let them go. I mean... But, boy, I hate the way it looks.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
By the way, I would have voted for Obama for a third term if I could.
Best president in my lifetime. Hands down.
-I agree. -Yeah.
So what do your parents do, Chris?
Uh... My dad wasn't really in the picture.
My dad wasn't really in the picture. My mom passed away when I was, like, 11.
Oh, I'm sorry. How did she die?
A hit-and-run.
[Dean] That's awful.
-Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. -You were young.
Actually, I don't remember a lot from that time, so...
Well, that's okay. We don't have to talk about that.
You smoke, Chris?
You jonesing a little bit over there, huh?
I'm quitting.
Dad, this is why I don't bring people to the house anymore.
That's okay. We're not judging. We're not.
That's a nasty habit, though.
You should have Missy take care of that for you.
How? [Dean] Hypnosis.
She developed a method, and I'm telling you, it works like a charm.
Wow, um...
Some people don't want strangers messing around in their heads, guys.
Listen, Chris, I thought it was total bullshit.
I smoked cigarettes for 15 years.
I loved every goddamn puff I took. She puts me under once...
The sight of a cigarette makes me want to vomit.
Okay, fall back, Dean.
It's a service we provide.
I'm good, actually.
-[Missy] Yes. -Thank you, though.
Well, smoker or not, we're thrilled to have you up here
-for the big get-together. -Yeah.
Wait, holy shit. That's this weekend?
[Missy] Yes, this weekend.
-What get-together? -Oh, my God.
Thanks, George. -It's Rose's grandfather's party. -[Rose sighs]
My dad would throw a shindig once a year.
Get all his friends together,
bocce ball, badminton...
[Rose] Wait, why didn't you guys tell me about this?
Well, it's the same day every year, sweetheart.
-No, it's not. -[Missy] Um...
-[Dean] It is. -Actually, it is.
Is it really?
[Dean] Yeah, that's where you'd be wrong. [Missy] Yeah.
We just kept it up because after they died, it felt like...
We keep them close to us.
Yeah, they're still with us.
[Rose's voice distantly] I just wanted to have a chill weekend.
[Chris] Sounds like fun, actually.
[Missy] Oh, Georgina.
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Why don't you go lay down? Just get some rest.
Yes, I think I will. [Missy] Good.
-My God, it must be very-- -'Sup, fam!
Hey, Jer-Bear.
-Hi, darling. -Hey, buddy.
Nobody answers the door around here?
Hey, Rosie.
-[Dean] Why would I lie, huh? -[all laughing]
I love it!
Did she tell you about her toenail collection?
Did she tell you about her toenail collection? -What? -Oh, my God!
She used to bite 'em off, suck on 'em, and save 'em in a jewelry box.
No, I didn't. I don't know what you're talking about.
[Chris] That is so disgusting.
I fucking hate you. Okay, here's a good one.
Uh, let me set the scene. It was our junior year.
Rose has a crush on this guy, Conner Garfield.
[Rose] No. [Dean] Conner Garfield.
No. Mom?
No. No, Jeremy, stop.
No, no, these are good, these are good.
I want to hear them. Yeah, Rose, where are your manners?
Our guest wants to hear the stories, please.
[Jeremy] Thank you. So Conner's from my lacrosse team, right? Huge kid, like 6'3".
So Conner's from my lacrosse team, right? Huge kid, like 6'3". And he's pretty dumb, right? So we threw this party.
And he's pretty dumb, right? So we threw this party. You threw a party.
I think my parents were in Greece or something.
We raided their liquor cabinet and we're all shit-faced. Like 15 of us.
Oh, my God. Tell me this isn't true, Rose.
[Jeremy laughing] Yeah.
I filled the liquor bottles with water... And let me finish?
Uh-huh. Go ahead. I'm curious. So I'm upstairs hooking up with the hottest girl in class, Jean Deely.
So I'm upstairs hooking up with the hottest girl in class, Jean Deely.
[Missy] Oh, God.
You realize you're coming off as, like,
the world's biggest douchebag, right?
So Conner starts banging on the bathroom door, right?
I open it.
And blood's gushing from his mouth. And he's screaming,
[imitating lisp] "Your sister bit my fucking tongue off!"
-You bit him? -[Missy] What?
-You bit him? -[Missy] What? Okay, to be fair, it was my first kiss
and he slipped some tongue and I was not expecting it.
-It was a reflex. I'm sorry. -[groans]
A reflex that I have since gotten rid of.
-Yeah. -[Dean] Yeah, you better be careful.
-Yeah, I'm very careful now. -[laughing]
I'm gonna go get dessert. And, Dean, maybe clean it up just a little bit?
So, Chris, what's your sport? Football? Baseball?
Basketball, mostly, I guess.
You an MMA fan?
[Rose] Dude. "Dude" what?
What?
Hey, Jeremy, why don't we let someone else have the floor for a second?
You're dating my sister, right?
He's dating my sister. You had your chance.
I can't get to know the guy?
You mean like UFC?
Yes. Nah, too brutal for me.
You ever get into street fights as a kid?
I did judo after school, first grade.
-[Rose] Aw... -You should've seen me. Judo?
'Cause with your frame and your genetic makeup,
if you really pushed your body,
and I mean really train, you know?
No pussyfooting around. You'd be a fucking beast.
[Missy] Carrot cake!
-[Dean] Ooh! -Hi. [chuckling]
Carrot cake.
What did I miss? [laughs]
A whole bunch of nothing. Just talking about sports. Right?
Just talking about sports. Right? Yeah.
That sounds good.
So the thing about jiu-jitsu is
strength doesn't matter, right? It's all about this.
It's a strategic game like chess.
It's all about being two, three, four moves ahead.
Cool.
Stand... Stand up.
Jeremy, uh, no karate at the dinner table. [Jeremy] It's not karate, Ma.
Yo, I got a rule. No play-fighting with drunk dudes.
I don't play, I'm just... Jeremy.
I wasn't gonna hurt him.
[Rose brushing teeth] He was gonna put you in a fucking headlock.
[muffled] What is his problem?
He has never treated any of my boyfriends that way.
Ever, ever, ever.
Oh, my God. And then my dad with the "my man" stuff.
"My man, my man."
I don't think he's ever heard that or said it. And now he just...
I don't think he's ever heard that or said it. And now he just... It's all he says.
Yup. Oh, and my mom being rude to Georgina?
What the fuck was that about? That was so crazy.
I mean... How are they different than that cop?
That's the fucking bummer of it all.
Anything more you'd like to add?
I told you so, like...
I didn't want to say it.
I didn't want to say it. I didn't want to say that.
I don't like being wrong.
I've noticed that. But I am sorry.
No, no, no. Wait. Come here. Come here. Come here.
[Rose] I'm sorry. This sucks.
What? Why you saying "sorry"?
'Cause I brought you here and I'm related to all of them.
No, it's fine. It's fine.
-Yeah? -Yeah?
-Uh-huh. -How are you so calm?
Honestly, it's nothing.
I like you on your racial flow, though.
-Is this a racial flow? -Racial flow.
Am I feeling a racial flow?
Yeah, you're feeling racially flowy.
Oh, fuck. The party.
How bad can it be? They are so white. Like, so white!
They are so white. Like, so white!
It's all good.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
You know, with my genetic makeup, shit gonna go down.
I'm a beast. I'm a beast!
Do you realize how dangerous smoking is?
Yeah. Come in and sit with me.
Please?
Just for a little while. Please.
Thank you.
So you're comfortable enough, right? It's perfect. Thanks.
Sure.
You wanna know how it works?
You just dangle a pocket watch in front of people's faces? Is that it?
You watch a lot of TV.
-When I was a kid. -Uh...
Now you're feeling very sleepy.
We do use focal points sometimes to guide someone into a state of heightened suggestibility.
to guide someone into a state of heightened suggestibility.
"Heightened suggestibility." That's right. That's right.
Do you smoke in front of my daughter?
I'm gonna quit. I promise. That's my kid. That is my kid.
That's my kid. That is my kid. You understand?
What about your mother?
What about her? Wait, are we...
What about her? Wait, are we... Where were you when she died?
I don't want to think about that.
Home. Watching TV.
Do you hear the TV? What do you hear?
Rain. Rain. It was raining.
You hear the rain?
You hear it? Find it.
Tell me when you've found it.
Come here, Chris. Look at me.
I found it. Where was your mom?
She, uh...
She was coming home and she wasn't home.
-From work? -Mmm-hmm.
And...
What do you do?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I just sat there.
-You didn't call anyone? -No.
Why not?
I don't know. I just...
Thought that if I did, it would make it real.
You're so scared.
You think it was your fault.
How do you feel now?
I can't move.
You can't move.
Why can't I move?
You're paralyzed.
Just like that day when you did nothing.
You did nothing.
Now,
sink into the floor.
-Wait, wait, wait. -Sink.
Now you're in the Sunken Place.
'Sup, man?
They're workin' you good out here, huh?
Nothing I don't want to be doing.
Yeah.
I didn't get to meet you, actually, up close. I'm Chris.
I know who you are.
She is lovely, isn't she?
Rose?
Yeah, she is.
One of a kind. Top of the line.
A real doggone keeper.
Right.
Sorry about last night. What?
My exercise.
I didn't mean to scare you.
Yeah. Yeah.
-And did it work? -Did what work?
You were in Mrs. Armitage's office for quite some time.
Oh, yeah.
I guess I had too much of that wine last night.
-Can't really remember. Sorry. -[chuckling]
Well, I should get back to work and mind my own business.
I think your mom hypnotized me last night.
What?
When?
I went out for some air last night, and I run into her.
And I can barely remember anything,
but now the thought of a cigarette makes me wanna throw up.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry. I can't believe she did that to you.
And I had some fucked-up dreams.
What'd you dream?
I was in a hole or something. And I couldn't move. It was like...
I was in a hole or something. And I couldn't move. It was like... Oh, God. That sounds terrible.
I'm sorry.
Hey, uh, what's Walter's deal?
What do you mean, "his deal"?
I just talked to him. Dude's whole vibe is hostile.
Did he say something?
It's not what he says. It's how he says it, you know?
Maybe he likes you.
Maybe he's jealous or something. I don't...
Are you fucking with me? No.
So you think I've got a chance with him?
-All right, you got jokes. -Put in a good word?
Great. No, funny.
I'm gonna talk to my dad about that. That's not...
-No, don't talk to your dad. -It's not cool.
It's fine, it's not a big deal. It's not a big deal.
Forget about it. It's done.
Okay.
Oh, boy.
Oh, man. [sighs]
It begins. Are you ready for this?
Yeah, I am. I'm not.
-There they are. -Oh!
-So nice. -How are you?
-Just smile. -Smile? All right.
How do you do that again?
Yeah, just smile the whole time.
Yeah, there you go. There it is.
Oh, look, it's the Greenes.
Gordon and Emily, this is Chris.
Chris, this is Gordon and Emily Greene.
Chris. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Chris. Nice to meet you indeed.
Nice to meet you, Chris. Nice to meet you indeed.
Oh, that's quite a grip. Thank you. You too, man.
You, uh, ever play golf?
Mmm, once, a few years ago. I wasn't very good.
Gordon was a professional golfer for years.
Oh, you kiddin'? Well, I can't quite swing the hips like I used to, though.
Well, I can't quite swing the hips like I used to, though.
But, uh, I do know Tiger. Oh.
-Oh, that's great. -Super.
Gordon loves Tiger.
Oh, the best I've ever seen. Ever. Hands down.
So, Chris, uh, let's see your form.
This is Nelson and Lisa. Hey, how you doin'?
So, how handsome is he?
-I don't know, are you handsome? -[chuckles]
Okay.
-Oh! -Not bad. Eh, Nelson?
So, is it true?
Is it better? Oh, wow.
Fairer skin has been in favor for the past, what,
Fairer skin has been in favor for the past, what, couple of hundreds of years?
But now the pendulum has swung back.
Black is in fashion.
Pardon me, I'm gonna take some pictures.
Sure thing.
-There he is. -[all] Oh!
Good to see another brother around here.
Hi. Yes, of course it is.
Something wrong?
[Philomena] There you are.
Do something with this. Ah, yes, yes.
Oh, hello. I'm Philomena. And, uh, and you are?
Chris. Rose's boyfriend.
Fantastic.
You two make a lovely couple.
Thanks.
Oh, where are my manners?
Logan. Logan King.
Chris was just telling me how he felt much more comfortable with my being here.
much more comfortable with my being here.
That's nice.
Logan, I hate to tear you away, dear, but
the Wincotts were asking about you. Ah, mmm.
Well, it was nice to meet you, Chris.
-[chuckles] -Goodbye.
What the fuck?
Ignorance.
Who? All of 'em.
They mean well, but they have no idea what real people go through.
-Jim Hudson. -Chris.
I know who you are.
I am an admirer of your work. You have a great eye.
Wait, Jim Hudson? Hudson Galleries?
Believe me, the irony of being a blind art dealer isn't lost on me.
How'd you do it?
My assistant describes the work to me in great detail.
You've got something.
The images you capture. So brutal, so melancholic.
It's powerful stuff, I think.
-Thank you. -Hmm.
Used to dabble myself, wilderness mostly.
I submitted to Nat Geo 14 times before realizing I didn't have the eye.
I began dealing. Then, of course, my vision went to shit.
-Damn. -[chuckles]
I know. Life can be a sick joke.
One day, you're developing prints in the darkroom.
The next day, you wake up in the dark.
Genetic disease.
Shit ain't fair, man. Ooh, you got that right. Shit ain't fair.
Ooh, you got that right. Shit ain't fair.
Hey.
Come here, come here.
What the fuck? You left me out there.
Look at this.
She unplugged my phone.
Who?
Georgina. I came here to talk to Rod, and I got no juice.
So you think she did that because...
Maybe she doesn't like
the fact that I'm with you.
Really?
It's a thing. So you are so sexy that people are just unplugging' your phone?
So you are so sexy that people are just unplugging' your phone?
Forget it. Never mind. No, no, no. Stop, don't...
[sighs] Don't do that. Don't...
Okay, okay, I'm sorry. It's all good, all right?
They got you on display now, huh?
[Chris] It's weird, man. And it's the people here, too.
It's like they haven't met a black person that doesn't work for 'em.
Yep, you're in it.
Also, shit... I don't even wanna tell you.
What?
I got hypnotized last night.
Nigga, get the fuck outta here.
No. Yo, yo. Yeah, to quit smoking.
But it's Rose's mom's a psychiatrist, so...
Bruh, I don't care if the bitch is Iyanla Vanzant, okay?
She can't fix my motherfuckin' life. You ain't gettin' in my head.
I know. She caught me off-guard, right?
But it's cool because I'm cured. It worked.
Bruh, how are you not scared of this, man?
Look, they could've made you do all types of stupid shit.
They'd have you fuckin' barking like a dog,
flying around like you're a fuckin' pigeon,
lookin' ridiculous, okay?
Or, I don't know if you know this,
white people love making' people sex slaves and shit.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're not a kinky sex family, dawg.
Look, Jeffrey Dahmer was eating the shit outta niggas' heads. Okay?
But that was after he fucked the heads.
Do you think they saw that shit comin'?
Hell no.
Okay? They was comin' over there like,
"I'mma just suck a little dick, maybe jiggle some balls and shit."
No. They didn't get a chance to jiggle shit
because their head was off their fuckin' body.
Yeah, they still sucked a dick, but without their heads.
It was fuckin' weird, detached head shit.
You know, that's Jeffrey Dahmer's business.
And thanks for that image right there, man.
Hey, man, I ain't makin' this shit up. I saw on A&E, man. It's real life.
Yo, and it's the black people out here, too.
It's like all of them missed the movement.
'Cause they probably hypnotized.
Look, bruh, all I'm doin' is connecting the dots.
I'm taking what you presented to me, okay?
I'mma tell you this. I think that mom
I'mma tell you this. I think that mom is puttin' everybody in a trance,
and she's fuckin' the shit out of 'em.
Thanks, Rod, bye.
-[Georgina] Hello. -Fuck. Hi.
I owe you an apology.
How rude of me to have touched your belongings without asking.
No, it's cool. I was just confused.
Well, I can assure you, there was no funny business.
Allow me to explain.
I lifted your cellular phone to wipe down the dresser,
and it accidentally came undone.
-Yeah, I told-- -Rather than meddle with it further,
I left it that way.
How foolish of me.
It's fine. I wasn't trying to snitch.
Snitch?
Rat you out.
Tattletale.
Yeah.
Oh, don't you worry about that.
I can assure you...
I don't answer to anyone.
Right.
All I know is sometimes
if there's too many white people, I get nervous, you know?
No. No. No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Aren't you something?
That's not my experience. Not at all.
The Armitages are so good to us.
They treat us like family.
[whispering] This bitch is crazy.
The bitch is crazy.
[Dean] Oh, hey, hang on. Chris.
Chris, I wanna introduce you to some friends.
This is David and Marcia Wincott, Ronald and Celia Jeffries,
Hiroki Tanaka, and Jessika and Fredrich Walden.
Too many names to remember, but hi. [chuckles]
[Hiroki] Do you find that being African-American has more advantage or disadvantage in the modern world?
has more advantage or disadvantage in the modern world?
It's a tough one.
Yeah, um, I don't know, man.
Hey.
Yo, my man.
They were askin' me about the African-American experience.
Maybe you could take this one.
Well, well, I find that the African-American experience
for me has been, for the most part, very good.
Although I find it difficult to go into detail
as I haven't had much of a desire to leave the house in a while.
-[both chuckle] -We've become such homebodies. Yes, yes.
Yes, yes. But even when you go into the city, I've just had no interest.
The chores have become my sanctuary.
[whispers] Fucking shit.
Get out.
-Sorry, man. -Logan...
-Get out! -Yo!
-Get out! -Yo! -Yo, chill, man. -Get out!
-Get outta here! Get outta here! -Chill! Chill, man! Chill!
-Get the fuck outta here! -Chill!
Seizures create anxiety which can trigger aggression.
Yeah, but randomly attacking other people?
It's not random. You know, it was your flash. That's what set him off.
You know, it was your flash. That's what set him off.
-Hey. -Well...
-How's he doing? -He's much better.
I imagine that I owe you all an apology.
[Missy] No, no, no. We're just very happy that you're yourself again.
-Yes. Yes, I am. -Hmm.
And I thank God for you for calming me down.
I know that I must've frightened you all quite a bit.
Especially you, Chris.
No. I'm sorry.
The flash. I didn't know.
Of course not. How could you have?
And you shouldn't have been drinking, either.
[Logan] Yes.
Well, I'll have to let you all get on
the rest of the night without the aid of my marvelous wit.
The whole ordeal has made me quite a bit exhausted.
Logan, you just get some rest.
It was nice meeting you, Chris.
Yeah.
Something to lighten the mood?
Yes! Yeah, let's get this party back on track.
How about sparklers and Bingo?
We're gonna go on a walk.
You sure?
Shall we?
My cousin's epileptic. That wasn't a seizure, right?
My dad's a neurosurgeon. And that's what he said it was. I'm inclined to trust--
And that's what he said it was. I'm inclined to trust--
-That wasn't a seizure. -What was it then?
How long have you known that guy?
I met him today. Why?
Man, this is gonna sound weird,
but when he came at me,
it felt like I knew him.
Like you've met Logan before?
No, I don't know Logan. I knew the guy that come at me.
I think your mom got in my head, all right? I think she got in my head.
Yeah, and it worked, I thought-- No, it did not. It didn't work.
No, it did not. It didn't work.
She got in my head, and now I'm thinking all this fucked-up shit that I don't want to think about.
and now I'm thinking all this fucked-up shit that I don't want to think about.
Like what?
I just need to go.
-You wanna go. -Mmm-hmm.
Without me.
Whatever you want.
I told you about that night my mom died.
When I didn't call 911, didn't go out looking for her.
[softly] Yeah.
One hour went by, then two, then three.
And I just sat there.
I was just watching TV.
There's nothing you could've done.
I found out later that, uh,
she had survived the initial hit.
She laid there bleeding by the side of the road,
cold and alone.
That's how she died in the early morning, cold and alone.
And I was watching TV.
-There was time. There was time. -You were just a little kid.
There was time.
There was time, if somebody was looking for her.
There was time, but nobody, nobody was looking.
You're all I got.
I'm not gonna leave here without you. I'm not gonna abandon you, okay?
You're not?
No. No, I'm not. No.
Oh, my God.
You scared me.
Let's go home.
What?
Let's go home. This sucks.
This sucks. Let's go home. I'll make something up.
I love you.
I love you too, baby.
-Good night. -Thank you.
Come on, sweetie.
Good night, Chris! It was great to meet you.
Asshole.
Yo! That's Dre.
Dre?
Andre Hayworth. He used to kick it with Veronica.
Andre Hayworth. He used to kick it with Veronica. Veronica from what?
Teresa's sister, that worked at the movie theater on Eighth!
Yes, that is him! That is him! But wait, wait, wait...
This is so fucking, fucking crazy!
Yo, he's different. No shit. Why's he dressed like that?
No shit. Why's he dressed like that? It's not that, it's everything.
He came to the party with a white woman 30 years older than him.
Sex slave! Oh, shit!
Chris, you gotta get the fuck up outta there, man!
You in some Eyes Wide Shut situation. Leave, motherfucker!
Hello? You gonna be a-- Hello? Chris?
Oh, shit. His battery must've fuckin' died.
Hey, handsome. Are you packing?
Hey, handsome. Are you packing? Rose, we gotta go. We gotta go now.
Rose, we gotta go. We gotta go now.
-Okay. -Okay.
Is everything okay?
I'll tell you in the car. But we gotta go right now.
-Is that okay? -Okay, yeah.
-Uh, let me go get my bag. -Okay.
Okay.
Shit!
Hey, you ready?
Yeah, I'm just looking for my camera.
It's right here.
Have you got the keys? I'm gonna put the bags in the trunk real quick.
Okay.
Uh, yeah. They are in here somewhere.
-It's just a matter of finding them. -Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Might take me a second.
Hey, uh...
What, you can't find those keys?
No. I can never find them. [chuckles] Let's do this on the move.
Yeah.
-Chris? -Just get the keys.
-Yo. -Yo, man.
Where you going? The party was just getting started. Just putting the bags in the car, man.
Would anyone like tea?
Nah, I'm good. We leavin', actually.
Really? Why? Is something wrong?
-Rose? -His dog got really sick.
So he has to be at the vet first thing in the morning.
-Sick. -Yeah.
[Missy] Oh, how terrible.
-Rose, the keys. -[Rose] Looking.
Rose?
What is your purpose, Chris?
What?
In life, what is your purpose?
Right now,
it's finding those keys.
[Dean chuckles] Fire.
It's a reflection of our own mortality.
We're born, we breathe, and we die.
Rose?
I'm looking.
Even the sun will die someday.
But we are divine.
We are the gods trapped in cocoons.
Rose...
I don't know where they are. Rose?
[yelling] Rose! Rose, give me those keys!
Rose, give me...
Give me those keys. Rose, now! Now, the keys!
Be careful, bro.
What the fuck? I didn't do anything.
[Rose whimpering] What the fuck is going on?
Where are those keys, Rose?
You know I can't give you the keys, right, babe?
Come on.
[Jeremy] Oh, shit!
-[Missy] Is he hurt? -Did you see him drop?
Yes, I did. Jeremy, grab his legs, please.
Take him downstairs. Dean, help him.
I can get him alone. [Missy] No, you can't.
You've already damaged him enough. Okay, fine.
Okay.
-Ready? [grunts] -Mind his head. Please.
[Missy echoing] Easy.
-[Dean] You're gonna drop him. -No, I'm not.
You're not gonna give me a little credit?
Okay, that was my fault.
[echoing] You were one of my favorites.
[Jeremy] You hear that, Chris? Huh?
You're one of her favorites. Chris?
[on voicemail] Hey, it's Chris. I'm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.
I'm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.
Chris!
[on voicemail] Hey, it's Chris. I'm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.
I'm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.
Yeah.
Me too.
[man on TV] ...College Fund.
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
[woman on TV] Millions of Americans feel the effects of aging.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit!
[Roman on tv] Is there anything more beautiful than a sunrise?
Hi. I'm Roman Armitage.
Hi. I'm Roman Armitage. And if you're watching this, you're probably wondering what's going on.
And if you're watching this, you're probably wondering what's going on.
There's no need to worry.
Let's take a walk.
You have been chosen because of the physical advantages
you've enjoyed your entire lifetime.
With your natural gifts and our determination,
we could both be part of something greater.
Something perfect.
The Coagula procedure is a man-made miracle.
Our order has been developing it for many, many years,
and it wasn't until recently it was perfected
by my own flesh and blood.
My family and I are honored
to offer it as a service to members of our group.
Don't waste your strength, don't try to fight it.
You can't stop the inevitable. And who knows?
Maybe one day, you'll enjoy being members of the family.
Behold,
the Coagula.
What the fuck?
Hello, Mr...
Uh, Williams. Rod Williams.
Uh, Williams. Rod Williams. From the TSA?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, you know all TSA issues should be brought up with your authorizing officer.
Yes, ma'am, but this is not TSA business.
Okay, don't call me "ma'am." Otherwise we're not gonna get along.
How can I help you, Rod Williams from the TSA?
-All right, here it is. -Mmm.
My boy, Chris, has been missing for two days.
Your son is missing?
Oh, no, no. Not my son, my friend. He's 26.
His name is Chris Washington.
He left on Friday with his girlfriend, Rose Armitage.
She's white.
All right. Go on.
Look, Chris was supposed to come back on Sunday, right?
-And I've been watching his dog, Sid. -[Sid whimpers]
That's Sid. Cute, right?
So Chris sent this to me from his girlfriend's parents' house.
See, that's Andre Hayworth.
Okay? Somebody we knew from back in the day.
Apparently, he's been missing for six months in some affluent suburb.
Well, he don't look so missing to me.
That's 'cause we found him, right?
But Chris said he's acting real different.
Different how? This dude is from Brooklyn.
Huh? He didn't dress like this.
I didn't use to dress like this.
Plus he's married to a white woman twice his age.
And that would explain the clothes. All right.
Oh, Lord! Rod Williams from the TSA.
I know, I know, I know. Okay, I'm trying to work towards this.
Look, what I'm about to tell you gonna sound crazy.
-You ready? -All right.
Try me.
I believe they've been abducting black people,
brainwashing 'em, making 'em work for 'em as sex slaves and shit.
Oh, sorry about the "shit."
Sorry.
Hold on a second. Then he sent me some weird picture and I'm like,
"Oh, man, that's Andre Hayworth."
This dude been missing for six months, right?
So I do all my research, you know, 'cause as a TSA agent...
You guys are detectives? I got the same training, you know?
We might know more than y'all sometimes.
'Cause we dealin' with some terrorist shit, so...
But that's a totally different story.
So, look, I go do my detective work, right?
And I start putting pieces together. And, see, this is what I came up with.
They're probably abducting black people, brainwashing 'em and making 'em slaves.
Or sex slaves. Not just regular slaves, but sex slaves and shit.
See, I don't know if it's the hypnosis that's making 'em slaves or whatnot,
but all I know is they already got two brothers we know,
and there could be a whole bunch of brothers they got already.
What's the next move?
And don't ever, ever say that I don't do nothin' for you.
Oh! White girls. Oh, they get you every time.
Magic ain't real.
None of this shit makes sense.
[Rose] Hello?
Chris? Yo, um...
[stutters] Hey, what up? Rose, it's me, Rod.
[stutters] Hey, what up? Rose, it's me, Rod. Hi.
Where's Chris?
He left two days ago.
He left?
Yeah. He got all paranoid, and then he freaked out on me.
And then he just got in a cab and left his phone.
Wait. You haven't seen him?
No, he never came back here.
[gasps] Oh, my God.
Look, look, I've been calling his phone a bunch of times.
Matter of fact, I went to the police.
What did you say?
I just said he was missing.
Oh, good. Uh...
Let me ask you somethin'.
What cab company did he, uh, use to leave?
What cab company did he, uh, use to leave? Oh, gosh, I...
I don't know. I guess maybe a local one.
I don't know. I guess maybe a local one. Or I guess he could've called an Uber?
Um, wait. I'm so confused.
Oh, you confused? Okay.
You know somethin'? Me too. -Could you hold on one second? -Okay.
Okay. Hold on.
You lyin' bitch. She is lyin' like a motherfucker. I know that...
Ooh, that TSA shit tingles. This motherfucker's lying.
Okay, I got you. I'm gonna record your ass.
I'mma record the shit outta you.
You talk too goddamn much. You're gonna say somethin'.
Hold on. Record.
Speaker.
-Unmute. -[phone beeps]
Uh, Rose? -Uh-huh? -Um...
So last time I talked to Chris, he told me your mama hypnotized him.
Rod, just stop.
I know why you're calling.
Why is that?
It's kind of obvious, don't you think?
What?
That there's something between us.
No. What you talkin' about, girl? I called you about Chris.
No, Rod, whenever we'd go out, I remember you looking at me.
What the fuck you-- No! Chris is my best friend.
Look, if you did somethin' to him...
I know you think about fucking me, Rod.
Ain't nobody thought about fucking you! Why would you say some stupid shit?
What the... You ass! Fuck you! I didn't wanna--
Fuck you! Bye!
Shit!
God! She's so... She's a fuckin'... She's a...
God! She's so... She's a fuckin'... She's a... She's a genius.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hey, Chris. How's it going, buddy? [chuckles]
You can answer. There's an intercom in the room.
[stutters] Where's Rose?
Oh, you dirty dog.
You're one of the lucky ones, trust me.
Jeremy's wrangling method sounds way less pleasant.
I'm supposed to answer any outstanding questions,
concerns you may have so far.
Apparently, our common understanding of the process
has a positive impact on the success rate of the procedure.
You could give a shit, right? Okay.
Let me just tell you what it is.
Phase one was the hypnotism.
That's how they sedate you. Phase two is this.
Mental preparation. It's basically psychological pre-op.
Pre-op?
For phase three.
The transplantation.
Well, partial, actually.
The piece of your brain connected to your nervous system
needs to stay put, keeping those intricate connections intact.
So you won't be gone, not completely.
A sliver of you will still be in there, somewhere, limited consciousness.
You'll be able to see and hear
what your body is doing, but your existence will be as a passenger.
but your existence will be as a passenger.
An audience. You'll live in...
An audience. You'll live in... The Sunken Place.
Now you're in the Sunken Place.
Yeah. That's what she calls it.
Now, I'll control the motor functions, so I'll be...
Now, I'll control the motor functions, so I'll be... Me.
You'll be me.
Good, good.
You got it quick. Good on you.
Why us, huh?
Why black people?
Who knows?
People want a change. Some people wanna be stronger, faster, cooler.
faster, cooler. Black is in fashion.
But please don't lump me in with that. I could give a shit what color you are.
No. What I want is deeper.
I want your eye, man.
I want those things you see through.
This is crazy.
Okay, I'm done.
No, no, no, no.
Jeremy?
You fuck! You fuck.
Fuck you!
Come on! Come on!
One Mississippi. Two Mississippi.
Three Mississippi. Four Mississippi.
[dispatcher on phone] 911. What's your emergency?
I'm at the Armitage house. My name is Chris.
I'm sorry, sir, can you repeat that?
-I'm at the Armitage... -[Georgina exclaims]
No, no, no. Don't do it, don't do it.
Don't do it. Just fuckin' go.
Grandma.
You ruined my house!
Get him, Grandpa.
Damn you!
Let me do it.
[faintly] Chris, I'm so sorry.
It's me.
And I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Help. Help.
Help. Help me.
Oh, shit!
Chris!
I mean, I told you not to go in that house.
I mean...
How'd you find me?
I'm T-S-motherfuckin'-A.
We handle shit.
