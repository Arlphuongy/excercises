Foxtrot November Bravo, this is Lofton Homestead. Please come in.
Fullerton Airways, this is Foxtrot November Bravo.
Mail drop complete. Heading back to base.
[Jeff on radio] Roger that. Get a wiggle on.
Your next tour group's already been waiting 20 minutes.
Yeah, copy that. I'm on my way.
[Michelle] …Bravo, this is Lofton Homestead. Please come in.
Lofton Homestead, I'm reading you loud and clear. What's wrong?
Lofton Homestead, I'm reading you loud and clear. What's wrong? Doug's been bitten by a snake, and he's fading.
Doug's been bitten by a snake, and he's fading. We need to see Dr. Justman ASAP. Can you help us out?
We need to see Dr. Justman ASAP. Can you help us out?
No worries, Michelle, I'll be there in 20.
-You just get him ready to go. -We'll see you soon. Out. -[Dana] Fullerton Airways, do you read? -[Jeff] Go ahead.
-[Dana] Fullerton Airways, do you read? -[Jeff] Go ahead.
[Dana] Call Dr. Justman.
-I'm bringing Doug to see him. -[Jeff] What?
We have paying clients twiddling their thumbs here.
[Dana] It's an emergency. Snakebite.
[Jeff] Snakebite… Do you even have enough fuel to get there?
I'll make it.
[sighs] Hi, Dana. Thank God you were around. Strap in.
[Jeff] Eh, what am I gonna do with that girl?
[Dana] Valve sounded good up there, Nik.
Yeah, you better hope it does. Cost enough. Bloody rip off.
[Jeff] What would you do if you didn't have our customers -to pinch, ey, Mike? -[Mike] Keep 'em coming, Jeff.
-to pinch, ey, Mike? -[Mike] Keep 'em coming, Jeff.
You trying to send me to an early grave? You look pretty good to me. Have you been exercising?
You look pretty good to me. Have you been exercising?
Yeah, well, actually… Stop changing the subject.
You've got to stop putting remote air support over paying clients.
[Nikki] Wait, did we just lose another flight?
-[Dana] I had to help. It's Doug. -We're stretched thin here.
We've been stretched thin before. Not this thin. Price of parts is always rising.
Not this thin. Price of parts is always rising.
Every time we make a mail delivery or supply food or medicine
or fly Doug to Dr. Justman,
that's a potential paying tourist flight that doesn't happen.
Kills me to say it, but if we're gonna stay in the air,
we're gonna have to focus on profit.
Dad, remote air support is the reason Mom started Fullerton Airways.
That was the whole point.
[hesitates] I know, Dana, but-- Things will pick up. We just got to book more charter to it,
Things will pick up. We just got to book more charter to it, so I'll start running night flights.
[Jeff] You can't stay in the air 24/7, Dana.
You've gotta take some time for yourself.
-Don't make me say it. -Dana, I'm serious.
-Like Mom always said… -Sweety.
…"If you want something done, you've got to do it yourself."
-Let me hear it. -Do it yourself.
Do it yourself.
If you need me, I'll be doing ground checks.
[Jeff] She's a lot like you, Clara.
[William] Fullerton Airways.
Their margin has been cratering year on year.
They're not doing well.
No. Nobody says that. "They're not doing well."
It's unprofessional. They are… They are…
bleeding from the throat.
They're bleeding from the throat. That's good. That sounds tough.
Yeah.
You got this.
-[William exhales] -We're going around in circles.
Go and tell them to get back to me with a tender offer by noon tomorrow.
And you tell them that I expect their commitment.
Come in. Oh, Alex, spare me. I love the deal at 40.
Come in. Oh, Alex, spare me. I love the deal at 40. It's an insult at 50. [mouthing]
Good.
Now I have to go. My son's here.
Okay.
-[line disconnects] -William. Hello, Dad. Good to see you.
The board will be convening shortly, -so I only have a few minutes. -Yeah.
-so I only have a few minutes. -Yeah. So, your team leader tells me you're doing good work.
So, your team leader tells me you're doing good work.
As I recall, you were always stronger on your humanities than your maths.
I hope she's not just telling me what I want to hear.
I knew it was a good idea to start bribing her.
So then, how goes your little assignment? What have you got for me?
Oh, um, well, before we get into it, I just… I wanted to say thank you.
I'm looking forward to working with you.
William, I haven't got all day.
Yeah, right.
Right. Um…
Well, your, um, e-mail said to identify possible areas for consolidation.
I did some digging. Um…
Fullerton Airways, uh, their margins have been cratering year on year.
They're bleeding from the throat. But there are salvageable assets.
Um, aeronautical equipment, planes, real estate,
which, if we were to pull the trigger and sell,
would wipe the debt holdings off our books.
I must confess. I am a little surprised.
This is strong work.
Take care of it.
I don't… What do you mean?
Go to Fullerton and take care of it.
Right. Okay.
Okay, so the thing is, is Fullerton is, um, in Australia.
Yes.
[softly] That's a long flight.
Um, are you sure, though, that I'm the right, you know, person?
Because my temperament, I don't…
-Australia's very brash. -Nevertheless, we have to show
that we've done our due diligence before selling.
Inspect the operation, go over their books,
cross the T's, dot the I's and then… [clicks tongue]
Yeah.
Why me?
Because… next year, I plan to recommend you
Because… next year, I plan to recommend you for the position of junior director.
It's time. Time for you to take on real responsibility.
[chuckles] Wow.
Wow.
-God, thank you. -Don't thank me yet.
-Okay. -If…
If you're going to take on an executive role in this firm,
you have to demonstrate that you can do what's necessary.
-By going to… -Australia.
-Australia. -Correct.
The board meets again in just over a week.
I want you to take care of it, then present to them in person.
Okay.
That's good. Okay.
-William. -Yes. Yeah.
This is important.
Yeah.
Don't disappoint me.
No. Yes, sir.
[Nikki] '96 BMW K1100RS.
-Sick beast. -Uh-huh.
What's he asking?
-Fifteen grand? -[dart thuds]
[in sing-song voice] My turn.
-That was a shocker. -Also you suck.
-[Heath] Good shot, Nik. -Oi, what would you pay for a '96 BMW K1100RS?
-How many K's on it? -35,000.
-Eight grand? -Exactly.
[Heath] You know, uh,
Dana used to love hitting up Lang's field on the back of my '97, right?
[chuckles] Um, I think we remember things a little bit differently. -Oh. -[both chuckle]
Okay. Please get back together.
-Wouldn't hold your breath. -Please ignore her.
She's freakishly obsessed with my love life.
Excuse me? What love life?
I just think you need to get out more, okay?
I hate to say it, D, but, um, she's right.
[Nikki] I'm correct.
-[scoffs] -What's the problem anyway?
-Dating is fun. -When do I have time to go on dates?
Yeah, but that's exactly kind of the point right there.
You can't dedicate your entire life to work.
Have some Dana time.
And that's not a euphemism, don't be gross.
Love what you do, do what you love, never work a day in your life.
Isn't that what they say, Nikki?
Yes, but you don't have to be this nuts about it.
Jeff's, right, you know, maybe it's time we switched gears and…
I don't know, leave saving the day to the big guys.
Okay. Would you guys relax? I… I know what I'm doing.
-Is that so? -Mmm-hmm.
It's Dana's way or no way, huh?
No, it's not my way.
I just want to keep Fullerton Airways the way it's always been.
The way Mom made it.
I miss her too, you know. We all miss her.
She was real special. One in a million.
I guess in spite, you got to put your feet on the ground sometime.
Otherwise, life will fly right by you.
-Have you been practicing that? -Yes, in the mirror.
It was a pun about flying. It's very clever.
-All right, I'm out. -All right.
But remember, life will fly right by you.
Yeah. Wheels office. 8:00.
-All right. Bye-bye. I love you. -Yeah. I love you too.
Where else would you rather be?
-Morning, love. -Morning, Jeff.
All righty. What's on the docket for today?
Nikki!
-[sighs] Morning, team. -[vacuum whirring]
Uh, finally.
We've had a little surprise shake up here this morning.
Oh, by surprise you mean the e-mail you got three days ago?
Isn't that the one, Jeff?
I've been a bit behind on the admin.
Seems we're getting an impromptu visit from our friends at ITCM Financial.
They're sending someone to do an inspection.
Is that normal? I mean, we never hear from those guys.
Yeah, Jeff, why are they suddenly showing up?
Everything's okay, yeah, Dad?
I'm sure it's just routine, you know, check the books,
make sure everything's in order, that sort of thing. [chuckles]
-Okay, when do they get here? -Yeah, why don't you tell us?
-Okay, when do they get here? -Yeah, why don't you tell us? -[hesitates] Their ferry is due in a… -[foghorn blaring]
-You're kidding. -Afraid not.
We need you to go and get him while we finish up around here.
Huh? I can't. I have a mail drop at Packers Bay today.
The drop can wait, love.
Besides, you're the face of Fullerton Airways.
You should be the first one to greet our guest.
-But, Dad-- -His name's Mitchell.
Maybe take the scenic route back through town so we can finish up around here. And be nice.
so we can finish up around here. And be nice.
[Dana] You must be Mr. Mitchell.
-Pardon? -Uh, the suit tends to be a dead giveaway.
-My suit? -I'm Dana. Fullerton Airways. Welcome.
-My suit? -I'm Dana. Fullerton Airways. Welcome. -Let's get it going. -Look, miss, I think--
Look, no offense, but I've got a schedule to keep up,
so we're gonna make this a bit snappy.
I'm here to visit my cousin for a few days.
-Huh? -So, if you don't mind, have a lovely day.
Wait, you're Mr. Mitchell?
-Yes. Well, uh, William. -Dana.
You must be Mr. Randall's assistant.
-[Dana] Chief pilot, actually. -Ah.
This way.
[softly] Wanker.
This is, is it?
-Yeah, this is it. -Right.
Chuck your bags in the back here. -Chop, chop. We've got work to do. -All right. [clears throat]
-Chop, chop. We've got work to do. -All right. [clears throat]
[William] So, this is… This is Fullerton?
[Dana] This is it.
It's a long flight just to make a quick pop-in.
-Anything I should be worried about? -No, no, it's, uh…
Just wanted to see how you do things around here, that's all.
Copy that.
Here we are. Fullerton Airways.
[William] Very quaint.
Too much, Dad.
[chuckles] You must be William Mitchell.
-Yes. -Jeff Randall.
Welcome to Fullerton Airways, the region's favorite carrier.
-Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Randall. -Jeff, mate.
-Jeff. -[Jeff] This is Nikki.
She's our mechanic and resident tech whiz.
If it's broken, she can fix it.
-Very nice to meet you. -How do you do?
Good. I do good.
Let's take you on a tour of our humble facilities.
Fair warning. Air conditioning is busted.
Nikki's waiting for replacement parts. Story of our lives.
-[William] Right. -I'm gonna do some checks on Harriet.
My God.
-He's just a stiff in a suit, all right? -[Nikki] So hot.
[William] Well. You certainly weren't joking about the air conditioning.
It's, um… It's, uh, rustic.
Well, we like to keep things pretty down to earth around here. [chuckles]
-Please. -It's fine.
Uh, so, uh, how long have you had the place?
Uh, my wife and I set it up in '93. Next to our neighbors, uh, we're a bit grassroots,
Next to our neighbors, uh, we're a bit grassroots,
but our customers have always appreciated our personal style.
Well, that's what they tell us anyway.
[chuckles] I'm sure, yeah. What about you, Will?
-What? -Do you run a business with your wife?
Um, no, I'm not married, actually.
-Girlfriend? -No, no girlfriend.
-Boyfriend? -[Dana] Ahem. No, I'm…
I'm single.
-Interesting. -Sorry?
Um, so my record show that you're predominantly a tour company.
But I did want to ask about the remote air--
-Our remote air support. -Remote air support. Right.
Folks who live outside major cities are often reliant
on air delivery for, you know, -mail, supplies… -Mmm-hmm.
But, uh, we're re-evaluating that side of the business.
Remote air support is the soul of Fullerton Airways.
We've always done it, and we always will.
Right.
Um, I only ask because I…
Well, I did do a preliminary review of your accounts
before I came, Mr. Randall.
-Jeff, mate. Jeff. -Yeah, Jeff.
Well, it would seem the government subsidizes your fuel
-and your expenses for those flights. -[Jeff] Yeah, that's right.
Well, given the, um… scale of your operation
and, as you say, the size of your competitors
-and the fact that… -[scoffs] Unless I'm mistaken, you do only have one operational aircraft. Is that right?
Unless I'm mistaken, you do only have one operational aircraft. Is that right?
Well, it doesn't…
It doesn't leave much room for… profit.
There's more to life than profits, you know.
Yes, quite. Alas, it's rather a priority.
What's the point of this inspection anyway?
You fly halfway across the world to insult us?
-[Jeff] Dana-- -What's going on?
Why don't you, um, show Will Harriet, and we'll tidy up around here?
Sure.
Not like I had anywhere to be.
Here she is. Cessna 206.
[William] Why Harriet, if you don't mind me asking?
[Dana] That's my mom's sense of humor.
Right.
Uh, Harriet as in the female version of Harry.
I don't get it. Harry Houdini.
Harry Houdini?
Harry Houdini, the magician, straightjacket, Harry Houdini?
Yeah, well, Houdini was the first person to make a controlled flight in Australia.
Diggers Rest, Victoria, 18th March, 1910.
I didn't know that.
[Dana] Yeah, well, my mom was a nut for aviation history.
Well, it seems the apple didn't fall very far from the tree.
I suppose you'd, um, have to be a…
A bit of a nut to fly a thing like this, wouldn't you?
You know… [clears throat]
I have a delivery scheduled for this morning.
Why don't we go up?
Um, in this? Yeah. She's sturdy as a rock. Come on.
Yeah. She's sturdy as a rock. Come on.
Right. Big aerodynamic rock.
Strap in.
[Jeff over radio] What you up to, folks?
I'm giving our guest a little demonstration.
Um, copy that.
Well, I hope you and our extremely important guest have a good time.
A really good time.
[William] Cozy in here, isn't it?
-You've been doing this long? -[Dana] All my life.
[William] That's good.
This is Foxtrot November Bravo, requesting runway clearance.
-[Jeff] Roger that. You're good to go. -All righty.
Okay, sit back.
[William] Oh, my…
[Dana] Like I said, sturdy as a rock.
Yeah, it's a good time.
-I'm having a good time. -You all right?
It's tight fit, isn't it?
I don't know where to put my hands.
Like if I touch something, it's gonna…
Just put your hands down. Just put them there.
Man, you poms just can't hack it, can you?
I was in a hot air balloon once. It's not really the same.
What happens if something did go wrong?
-Are there parachutes in the back? -Only one.
It's not funny.
You know, I've had experiences when I was young, I was…
Not a plane exactly, but small spaces, you know.
You gonna talk this much the whole time we're up here?
[breathing heavily] What?
Whoa. Okay.
I'm sorry.
Not a bother.
Can I ask… How old is this plane?
She'll be 52 in June. Fif… Oh, my God.
Fif… Oh, my God.
Look over there, you can see Mount Abbot.
Very pretty.
Oh. Oh, well…
Okay. What are you doing?
Have a look out.
All right, sit back.
We're about to come in for our landing.
That was fun.
[Dana] Welcome to Packers Bay.
We do drops here every two weeks.
Without us, they'd be totally cut off.
Do you… Should I stay here?
What for? They won't bite.
Great.
Great. And I'm gonna go outside. I'm gonna look like a complete idiot.
I'm gonna ruin these shoes.
-Hey gang. -Hey, Dana.
[Dana] Sorry for the delay. Okey-dokey. We've got mail for
Nick, Serena, Shane. How lucky.
Brought your boyfriend along for the ride, eh, Dana?
Sorry to disappoint, but he's a bigwig from the UK.
He's come to check if we're spending our money responsibly.
[Serena] Well, they're doing a bang-up job.
-If it were me, I'd give them a raise. -Yes, well, yeah, I'm sure they are.
You heard about that nasty weather brewing off the coast?
[Dana] I don't know anything you don't.
Any luck, she'll drift south like the last one did.
I need to get Becky an X-ray appointment the 19th.
-Are you available then? -I think so.
-Hey, guys, do you mind if I play? -Yeah.
Me and you'll be on a team. Okay?
Oh, hand ball, ladies and gentlemen.
-You did it. -[Dana] Having fun?
-You did it. -[Dana] Having fun? Oh. Well, yeah. You know, they look like professionals.
Oh. Well, yeah. You know, they look like professionals.
I thought maybe they can teach me a thing or two.
It's time to get going, if you're ready, of course.
Yes. Yeah, of course.
-Bye all. -[all] Bye, Dana.
Bye.
-Howdy, howdy. -Hey.
Heath, this is William. William, Heath.
-G'day. -Hi. G'day. Good… Good day.
[chuckles] You're the one checking in? Yeah. Yes, I think so, yeah.
No worries. Give me a second and I'll grab the key.
Thank you very much for the demonstration today.
It was very, uh, educational, if not spotted with terror.
Oh, don't mention it.
-Well, it's been fun. -Yeah.
Probably won't see you much while you're here, so, uh,
-take it easy. -All right.
Quite a character, isn't she?
Yes. Yes, very tenacious.
Mate, you have no idea.
Here you go. Apartment number two.
Across the tarmac, up the stairs, and second on your left.
Right.
Across the tarmac.
Across the tarmac, okay.
Across the tarmac.
[groans softly] Oh, my God.
[panting] Oh, God.
-Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. -[cell phone ringing]
Hi, Dad.
Ah, are you settled in yet?
How's the arse end of the world?
Um, well, you know, I suppose it has its charms.
They're certainly a tightly knit community here.
Don't start getting attached. Have you reviewed their financials yet?
No. No, I haven't quite done that yet, but I will.
Time is of the essence, William.
Shut that place down. Get yourself home.
Knock, knock.
Hello.
-Morning, Will! -Oh, my giddy aunt.
-Sleep well? -Uh, yeah. Yeah.
-Sleep well? -Uh, yeah. Yeah. You know, the heat notwithstanding.
Losing the tie might help.
This is the tropics, mate. You should relax a bit.
Yeah.
Well, this is you.
-Feel free to settle in. -Great.
Well, I'm ready to jump into those financials if you are.
Uh, yeah, the financials.
I definitely do have them, just finalizing some reporting.
-Morning. -Ah, here she is. Ready to start the day.
-[Dana] Morning. -Morning.
Here I am, like every other morning.
Uh, have you seen Nikki?
She's supposed to be helping me out with the drops today.
Well, actually, Nikki called.
Her bike broke down on Macquarie Street, so she'll be late.
Seriously? We can't afford another late start.
We've got to get those first aid kits to Wattle Hills.
Hey, how about this?
Why doesn't Will go out and help you on your drops today, huh?
-Him? -Me?
Well, why not? Dana needs help.
And in the meantime, I can get these reports ready for you.
Seems a good solution for everybody. What do you say?
Good.
-Great. -Great.
Do you really think they're gonna hit it off?
Yeah. Trust me.
She never hangs out with anyone new. This will be good for her.
Plus, it can't hurt to make friends with the money people.
[Dana] You're handling it better than you did yesterday.
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm the epitome of a comfortable flyer.
So, what's life like in ITCM financial?
Must be pretty different than doing this for living.
Yes. Well, it's certainly less exciting. Less life-threatening.
Lots of fiscal projections and revenue KPIs.
Were you into that sort of thing as a kid? Did you really love the spreadsheets?
Not… Not so much.
But Dad owned the business, you know,
so it was just a given that I was gonna end up there.
That sounds familiar.
Your dad seems very friendly.
Oh, everyone loves Jeff, and Jeff loves everyone back.
What's it like working with him?
I won't have it any other way.
Doesn't mean it doesn't get turbulent sometimes.
-That was a flying pun, wasn't it? -Depends if you found it funny or not.
Sometimes he wants to take the business in a different direction, that's all.
He might be onto something.
You could say he was charting a different course.
That was a flying pun.
Come on.
Is this… Is this like a vintage car where it sort of has character?
-[rattling] -Something like that.
That's normal? That's a normal sound?
Oh, that's not a good sound. Mayday, mayday. Fullerton Airways, this is Foxtrot November Bravo.
Mayday, mayday. Fullerton Airways, this is Foxtrot November Bravo.
Mayday?
[Jeff] Dana, what's wrong?
We're suffering engine failure about five miles north of Sinclair Bay.
I'll make an emergency landing. Think it's the new exhaust valve.
Foxtrot November Bravo, Fullerton Airways. Copy that.
Stay on frequency and advise on landing.
And be safe.
[William] Oh, my God. Okay.
[breathing heavily] Okay, I feel like
maybe this would be a good time to tell you about my fear of flying.
-Oh, my God. -Come on.
[William] Dana?
Dana, Dana, Dana, that's very, very close.
Let's never do that again, ever.
Fullerton Airways, we're in one piece.
I'm gonna go check out the damage. I'll keep you posted.
-Over. -Roger that. Stay safe.
[William] And now it's zero operational aircraft.
Wonderful.
Right.
So, where are we exactly?
Uh, we're a little northwest of Cape Flattery.
It's not far from Lizard Island.
Lizard Island? That's… That's good.
So, what do we do now? We light up a flare or something or?
Nope.
What do you mean "no"? What, no?
It will be hours before someone's able to come pick us up.
Plus, I'd have to leave Harriet. There's no way.
If you want something done, you have to do it yourself.
Come on.
Pass me the shifter.
-Shifter? -It's that thing there.
To the right.
The other right.
Thank you.
Come here.
I need you to come and push down over here.
-In there? -Yeah. There.
Yeah. Now, don't loosen the pressure.
I'm not loosening the pressure.
[chuckles] You may have pressed a little too hard.
Okay, but I didn't loosen the pressure.
Okay. I'm gonna need a Phillips head screwdriver next.
Ah-ha. I know that one.
Thank you.
Okay, cross your fingers.
Come on.
Come on, girl.
These are good sounds.
This feels good. This does feel good.
Oh… bravo.
We know what we're doing.
[all] Cheers!
Will, who am I? "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
Will, who am I? "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!" That's very funny.
Oi, leave him. Poor fellow.
He's only been on the job for two days, he's already fixing planes.
Thank you, Nikki.
-Fixing plane… -Okay, all right. Forget her, all right?
If you get over this finance stuff, come work for me as my assistant.
That's a very attractive offer.
-Don't do that. -No, I'd like that.
-It would be an honor, actually, for him. -[cell phone chimes]
-Oh, sorry. -You…
-No, no, no. -Please.
-[Heath] Howdy, howdy. -Hi.
It's been a long time since I've seen you look that way at anything
-that didn't have wings and fuselage. -Excuse me?
I'm just trying to be a good host.
Seems like a nice enough guy.
Not entirely sure about the wardrobe choices.
Mmm. Tell me about it.
-[Heath] Can you do us all a favor? -Mmm?
Don't screw it up.
I'm sorry. But, would you mind your own business?
Say hi to your boyfriend for me.
Oh, subtle way of getting cut off, okay.
-It's for Dad, really. -[all laughing]
[reporter on TV] More on that category 3 low pressure system
gathering momentum off the coast.
Although presently forecast to continue moving in a south easterly direction,
tropical storms of this type are difficult to predict. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued…
The Bureau of Meteorology has issued… Yikes. I hope that one fizzles out.
-You okay there, buddy? -Yes. Yeah, very good. Really good.
[man] Hello, Australia. Welcome to the gala.
You play, Will?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Just about since I could walk.
Oh, boy, here we go.
Well, well, well.
Hope you're not too sore about the Ashes. That's too soon, Jeff. That's too soon.
That's too soon, Jeff. That's too soon.
Sorry, mate.
[groans] We felt the pain at Lord's that day, I can assure you.
You were there in person?
Yeah, well, Dad's a member, so we… You know, he's got good seats.
Oh. I bet you and your dad were fuming.
Well, he wasn't there.
Um, in fact, I'm not sure he's ever come to a match.
His loss.
Well, maybe it's better that he wasn't there
-given the thrashing we gave you. -[all laugh]
-He doesn't hold back, does he? -[Dana] No
[Nikki] Down it, Uncle.
Night, kids, I'm gonna hit the hay.
All that paperwork you need will be there in the morning, ready for you.
Right.
I think you'll see that there's a bit of life in the old girl yet.
-Yes. Yeah, I'm sure there is. -See you, kids.
-Night, Dad. -[Nikki] Goodnight.
Okay, peeps. That is me, I'm out. I'll see you both tomorrow.
Dana, you can't go because you have to walk Will home.
-Oh, I think he's fine. -I'm just on the tarmac.
I appreciate you trying to be a strong independent man,
but it's dangerous out there, okay? Drop bears.
Drop bears?
You need a guide.
Well, I mean, sure, I mean…
It'll be nice to have a guide, I suppose.
What's it like living in a place like this?
A lovely place, a lovely place like this?
Well, everybody knows everybody.
Everyone knows everyone's business.
What they don't know about you, they will assume pretty quick.
Also, if you have a break up, get used to seeing your ex every day
because they're probably making your morning coffee.
Right, I will… I will bear that in mind.
No. But honestly, no pollution, no noise, no traffic,
and your neighbors are like family.
I'm lucky because that family stretches from Fullerton
to the Lockhart River, 1600 kilometers round trip.
That's my home.
And what about your parents?
I mean, why did they want to live here?
It was my mom. Clara.
She was so passionate about our community.
She always believed in giving back and helping others.
And she loved to fly.
I mean, Fullerton Airways was her dream.
-Sorry, I didn't mean to… -No, no, no.
I guess that's why I'm so protective because…
Well, it's the last part of her that I still have.
-Maybe that's weird though. -No.
No, it isn't at all.
I mean, that's the perk of the small town life.
You see, when Mom…
Well, yeah.
Dad and I, we never felt alone, ever.
That helped a lot.
Yeah, I can imagine.
-Anyway, what about you? -Me?
Growing up in the big city, next in line to your dad's throne,
-what's that like? -Um…
To be honest, it's pretty boring.
You know, Dad owned a multimillion-pound company, he didn't…
Didn't really have time for, um,
well, school fetes, rugby matches, that sort of thing.
-Never would have guessed. -[chuckles]
Yeah, it turns out, working for him wasn't really all that different.
You know, you can always take Nikki up on her offer.
A little change of scenery,
-get your hands dirty. -Yep.
I think you'll look pretty good in a pair of overalls.
-Do you? -Mmm.
They go well with my brogues.
Not so sure about that bit though.
-[William] Wow. -Yeah. It's pretty beautiful, huh?
It doesn't look like this back home.
-[Dana] So, that's the emu in the sky. -Okay.
That one is special because it's outlined by the dark areas of the night sky,
-not by the stars. -Mmm.
It's been featured in traditional storytelling for thousands of years.
That's beautiful.
Oh. That one over there you can see, that's actually--
-Southern Cross. Is it? -Bingo.
I knew that.
Oh, that big, bad boy over there, that's the Tarantula Nebula.
-Tarantula? -Mmm-hmm.
-It seems rather fitting for this place. -[chuckles]
Yeah.
You know…
I'm very impressed.
Well, they're handy to know.
When push comes to shove,
a pilot can always count on them to point the way.
-[koala bellowing] -Oh! Oh, my God! What is that?
-Relax. [laughs] -No, what's that?
-No, that's not funny. What is that? -That is a koala.
-A koala? -Yes.
That sounds like a dinosaur.
No, this country's too much. [sighs in relief]
Oh, my gosh, Nikki was right.
-What was Nikki right about? -You really do need me here.
I don't disagree with her.
Well, um, thank you for protecting me.
It was, um, both pathetic and English of me.
Have fun with Jeff tomorrow.
-Yeah. -And today was a total write-off,
I'll be slammed trying to catch up tomorrow.
Well, I mean, I'd be very happy to help.
Properly this time, I mean.
With drops?
Yeah.
What about your work?
Well, I still have a few days left.
And, you know, I like to make sure that I'm making a thorough appraisal of my work.
-Right. -[both chuckle]
It's the least I can do.
I've taken up so much of your time already.
Well, uh, yeah, I guess I could use some help picking up the slack.
Right. Right. Good.
Good, great. Great, fantastic.
Well, I'll see you in the morning.
Yeah. 0800.
Roger. Roger.
I'm not kidding. If you're not there, I'll fly without you.
Yes, ma'am.
I believe this is yours.
Yeah. Yes. Thank you.
Thank you. [clears throat]
Mary, before you go, have you heard from my son?
[Mary over phone] Nothing yet, sir. I'll be sure to let you know.
-[both laugh] -[Dana] Okay. Put me down.
Not bad, city boy. Now I am back on schedule.
Oi, Will?
You keen?
You heard the man. Keen?
[voicemail] This is William Mitchell. Please leave a message.
William, what the hell is going on?
It's as if you've wandered off the face of the earth.
The board is less than impressed.
Call me immediately.
No ball.
-Wide. -Dad!
It was a good game.
Yes, you've got a rather spirited fast ball, haven't you?
Yeah, well, I learned from the best.
Listen, I've been… My father and me just…
-[cell phone ringing] -Sorry.
Look, I've got to take this.
-Is that all right? -Yeah. No worries.
[clears throat] Hello, D. Hi, Nikki.
[Duncan] William, the board meets in two days, and I haven't heard from you. What's the delay?
and I haven't heard from you. What's the delay?
Well, actually, Dad, I have, um… I have been meaning to call. I, um…
I feel like maybe I was too hasty.
Uh, check it out. Finally. Better late than never.
Is that the new bilge pump?
No, I wish, it's for the air con.
-At least that will make Will happy. -And my sweaty pits,
-which is more important to me. -Fair enough.
I think maybe my assessment was off, and, um,
upon review, I feel like there are unforeseen advantages
to keeping Fullerton Airways operational.
Your assessment was off?
Yeah.
Do you really think I wouldn't have my team verify your figures?
Your assessment was right on target.
A stiff breeze would knock the place over.
What are you not telling me?
Well, you know, since I've been here on the ground and I've met the team,
I think… I think terminating them would be a mistake.
-Oh, bugger. -[Duncan] What have I always told you?
Never let it become personal. It just makes it all the more difficult.
I suppose now's your opportunity to learn that lesson.
Dad, please don't shut down Fullerton Airways. Please don't do this.
William, either do your job or don't bother returning to work.
This is for your own good. And one day you'll thank me.
Oh, God.
Who the hell do you think you are?
-Please let me explain. -Is this how you usually play it?
You show up, worm your way in, take a holiday.
-"Worm my way in"? -Then you stab everyone in the back.
Dana, I intend to stop this.
Okay. Don't make promises.
I heard that it pretty much sounds like a done deal.
Because I haven't come up with a better plan--
Save it! Where's Dad?
I've got to figure out what to do.
-Can you just give me a second, please? -Give you a second?
-[cell phone chimes] -This wasn't a very easy situation for me. You've done enough. Just go.
-Dana. -Guys. -Can you hear me out? -I've heard you.
-Can you hear me out? -I've heard you. Do you think this was easy for me?
-Do you have any idea-- -Just leave!
-[bangs] -Guys!
-Yes? -Cyclone. It's on the way.
-I'm sorry, what? -Oh, shit.
-What "Oh, shit"? -[siren blaring]
Where's Dad?
[Jeff] Let's go, everybody. Let's go. Gotta lock down.
Hey, you can't stay there. It's not safe. Come on.
[voicemail] G'day. You've reached Jeff from Fullerton Airways.
[voicemail] G'day. You've reached Jeff from Fullerton Airways.
Just keep trying.
Nik, go grab what we need and get inside.
-[Nikki] What are you gonna do? -I'm gonna go and find Dad.
[Nikki] Just be careful, okay?
[Dana] I'm coming, Dad.
Dana, hey, what can I do?
Step one, don't talk to me. Beyond that, I don't care.
[shouts] Dad? Dad?
Dad?
Dad!
Dad? You in here?
Dad? Can you hear me?
Dad!
Dana!
Dad.
Dana!
[Dana] Dad!
Dana!
-You okay? -[groans in pain]
Dad.
Slowly, slowly.
That's it. Just go slowly, Jeff. Don't put pressure on it.
All right?
-Okay? -[Nikki] Help us move this.
-Okay? -[Nikki] Help us move this. -Here, here. Push. -[Nikki straining]
-Here, here. Push. -[Nikki straining]
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Now, where were we?
Oh, yeah. Go to hell.
Whoa. [hesitates] What's that all about?
Oh. Oh, did you not tell him, Will?
-Why don't you, uh, let Jeff know? -Look, I'm--
ITCM Financial are shutting us down.
What? [straining]
No, Jeff.
Jeff, just relax. Look, I'll explain. Okay? I'll explain.
You came all this way just to stab us in the back?
That's exactly what I said.
I'm sorry. All right? I'm sorry.
-I should have said something. -You think?
The minute I get back to London, I'll recommend to the board
that we keep Fullerton Airways open and operational.
Dana, please believe me when I say that I care about this place.
-Give me a break. -I mean it.
[Dana] You must think we were born yesterday.
People like you don't give a damn about us.
I mean, why would a rich kid, heir of a multimillion dollar empire,
care about a place like this?
Because of you!
Because I care about you.
I care about you.
It was just getting to the good bit.
I'll find some light. There's a lantern here somewhere. Oh, here we go.
Look, um…
You don't…
-You don't need to say anything. -[William] Dana…
I thought I always knew where I was going to end up, you know?
But coming here…
and meeting you,
meeting all of you…
You don't know what it's like where I come from.
Everybody's out for their cut.
But you actually care.
You care about people.
You care about protecting the things that are important to you.
I don't think you realize how rare that is.
A week ago, this is the last place on earth I wanted to be.
Now I don't want to leave.
I promise I am going to fix this.
I swear.
Isn't this a dog's breakfast.
What are we looking at here? What's the damage?
Category 3… Geez.
Wind's 250, 280 K per hour.
There might not be a Fullerton Airways left to save if it goes on like this.
There's gonna be a lot of people out there who need help.
[Dana] Hey.
Hey. [clears throat] Hey.
It's over.
Right.
[Jeff] Bloody hell.
I'll go and get the genny.
Okay. I'm gonna do checks on Harriet.
All right, I'm gonna see if I can fire up the radio.
Oh, Jesus.
-[radio feedback] -[Nikki] Uh, testing, testing. Fullerton Airways radio check.
Fullerton Airways radio check. Fullerton Airways radio check.
Harriet's fine. There's no damage that I can see.
At least there's that.
-No signal from here. -Yeah, I wouldn't hold my breath.
You're lucky that I'm so diddly.
[man on radio] Mayday, mayday. Calling anyone out there.
This is the Bloomfield General Store. We require immediate help.
[officer] Come in. I repeat, this is the Packers Bay Police Department.
We are requesting…
[woman] This is from the council. We're in dire need of assistance.
All right. There are people out there who need our help. I'll man the radio.
Nikki, you start getting supply packages together.
Yep.
Dana and William, get that plane in the air.
Well, we haven't got all day!
[Dana] Hey. Snap out of it.
Take these over to Simon in the medical tent.
We'll drop off the rest and fly some folks to the hospital.
-[William] Yeah. -Come on, this way.
Right, we still got some more space here, mate.
[man] This is the last of the apple boxes.
[Jeff] Uh, Chilli Beach, supplies on the way. ETA 15:40.
There's medical, food, water.
Threw in a bottle of Scotch in there for you, Steve.
Thought you might need it. Over.
Roger, Packers Bay.
Supplies on the way. There's medical, food, water, blankets.
[Dana] All right, you guys have that.
-Hey. You're looking better. -[man] Yeah.
-Hey. -Please. Here, have this…
[Dana] No, yeah, that's fine. Keep it.
You know, you, um…
-You were amazing today. -[chuckles]
No, I mean it.
Today was a team effort.
Yeah, I'd rather think I was more there for emotional support.
The only way we were able to do as much as we did today was because of your help.
Not everyone would jump in like that.
I've got to admit it.
Having a flying partner these last few days, well,
hasn't been so bad.
So, thanks.
After everything these people have been through,
they still manage to muster a smile.
[Dana] Well, I guess that's a part of what makes this place so special.
[William] I completely forgot I had this on me.
I guess you're gonna want to get that dry cleaned.
Or not.
-Wait. How much did that cost? -A lot.
Yeah. Right.
To Fullerton Airways.
To Fullerton Airways.
You know, without the tie,
you kind of look like you could fit in here.
Just maybe.
-I hate to interrupt, but… -Hello, Dad.
I've just had an e-mail from ITCM Financial.
And?
Well, they've informed me that we're shut down. Effective immediately.
-They're… -Dad.
They're splitting us up for parts.
Will, if you're gonna do something, now would be a really good time.
Right.
[Mary] Hello. Duncan Mitchell's office.
Mary, it's Will. William. Can you, um, put my father on, please?
I'm sorry. Mr. Mitchell's in a meeting.
Mary, can you go and get my father now? Please, it's an emergency.
Just a moment.
William, this had better be damned important.
Dad, don't sell Fullerton Airways.
All right? Please don't do this.
Are you serious?
Scrapping that two-bit airline
is about the only bright side of this debacle.
I can find the money somewhere else.
All right? Just give me… Give me time.
The board has been briefed. I did your job for you.
It's done.
Dad, there's… There's value here. All right?
What was the point of me coming all this way?
The point of the venture was to prove to the company that you were ready.
Ready to take the next step.
Ready for real responsibility. I believed that you were--
Dad, you're not listening to what I'm saying.
We'll talk more when you get back.
-No, Dana-- -Best to let her go, mate.
Jeff, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I know, son. You did your best, but, uh,
fathers can be… stubborn sometimes.
Mary, no further calls.
You take care of yourself.
Jeff… look, if there's anything I can do…
Uh, keep working on that spin ball.
Stay, uh, above the batter's eyeline.
Okay? [chuckles]
-Okay? -All right.
I'll see you around, mate.
[Jeff] She would have been proud of you, you know?
I don't know about that.
Haven't exactly done the best job in keeping this place going.
You know your mother's saying,
"If you want something done, you do it yourself."
Well, that's about having the strength to stand up
when you see something that needs doing.
It's about taking action.
But that doesn't mean that it's your job to fix everything by yourself.
-Oh, she loved this place. -Yeah.
But the last thing she would have wanted was for it to become a burden for you.
What she wanted
more than anything else was for you to be happy.
Yeah.
-I really miss her, Dad. [sniffles] -I know, sweetheart.
So do I.
[Nikki] Oh, man, ITCM's gonna
[Nikki] Oh, man, ITCM's gonna have a hell of a hard time trying to sell this old girl.
Think I could just chuck 20 bucks and keep it?
To hell with that. You keep it, love. Give it a good home.
You know she's just gonna disassemble it for parts within ten minutes, right?
Still, better than lining the pockets of those greedy bastards across the pond.
[Nikki] Oh, no. [in British accent] Mr. Darcy's tablet is broken.
Perhaps he'll have to ask Papa for a new one.
Yeah.
I'm being a bit harsh on him, you reckon?
[Dana] Doesn't matter. The damage is done.
I think he meant well.
I just feel like surely he knows some way
to sweeten the deal with his old man, you know? Surely.
If my dad had a private equity firm… [exclaims]
Tell you what, there'd be no more duct tape engineering.
It'd all be world class, baby. Just state of the art.
-Wait. What'd you say? -State of the art?
That's it.
Yeah. Tell me about it.
No, I mean it. That's it.
No, you've lost me completely.
Dad, I have an idea. Hear me out.
Sure you're okay to go alone?
Don't worry, I'll be fine.
Just keep everything together until I get back.
Oh, and do me a favor. Radio ahead, get me a place to set down in Brissy.
Need to keep the old girl around for a few days.
All right. You got it. And, D, your mom would be so proud.
You really think this is gonna work?
It's our only shot.
[woman] Ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated with your seatbelts fastened.
[Duncan] Thank you, Marcus. Now, for our final order of business,
I'd like to discuss a particularly noteworthy development
from the lab team over at ESA. Mary, would you please show--
from the lab team over at ESA. Mary, would you please show-- [Mary] I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid there's someone--
[Mary] I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid there's someone-- -[woman] Excuse me? -G'day.
-[woman] Excuse me? -G'day.
-Hi, Will. -Dana.
I'm sorry, who are you?
What are you doing here?
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Well, I need to speak to your old man.
William, what is the meaning of this? Who is this woman?
Mr. Mitchell. Hi.
Uh, ladies and gentlemen of the board…
Yep. Well, my name is Dana Randall.
I'm the chief pilot at Fullerton Airways, a small Australian airline,
which you terminated a few days ago.
William, sit down.
Yeah.
[Duncan] Miss Randall, this is highly irregular.
-You'll need to leave. -If you give me five minutes--
-Mary, will you please call-- -Dad, Dad.
Let's hear her out.
Two minutes.
This had better be good.
Well, Fullerton Airways is a tiny operation
on the other side of the world.
But what you won't believe
is that we actually have something in common.
You see, we're both family businesses.
My mum and dad started ours when I was little and,
well, I promised myself that I would always protect it,
always keep it just the way that they made it.
The way that I always remembered it.
You know what happened? I killed it.
I think it might be better--
I killed it because I didn't want anything to change.
You know, and sometimes we do need to accept
that the best way forward is to chart a different course.
Look I came here today with a proposal.
We cannot stand still any longer.
The only way for Fullerton Airways to survive is to expand.
We need to bring in more pilots, more planes.
Here you go. This is yours. It's time to take the next step.
In order to do that, we are going to need a new injection of capital.
Now, with your support, we'll be able to increase the coverage,
almost triple the output within two years.
We can take Fullerton Airways
from a struggling family operation to a thriving business,
one that continues to serve the community in meaningful and essential ways.
So, I mean, what do you think?
I think this has gone on long enough.
Miss Randall, this is absurd. I'm familiar with your situation.
Do you honestly expect us to throw more money into this disaster?
There's no indication you'll be able to manage something like this.
What if they had a more experienced financial officer?
What?
Dad…
I'm resigning. Effective immediately.
I, uh… I'm gonna go and work for Fullerton Airways.
If they'll have me.
You must be joking.
No, I'm… I'm not.
But if you give me a chance to get this business on their feet,
I will show you that they do have legs.
Don't be ridiculous.
I mean, why in heaven's name would you want to throw away a career?
Dad, you built this business. This was your dream.
Don't you remember how that felt?
To believe in something so badly that you had to see it done?
But, William-- Look, I… I only came here because I wanted to make you proud.
Look, I… I only came here because I wanted to make you proud.
I still want that.
But I… I don't belong here.
I'm just asking you to trust me.
Trust us.
Please.
You really think you can do this?
We can.
Together.
-Mary. -Yes, sir?
Send in Simon and the legal team. We have a proposal to review.
Shall we?
You sure about this? I mean, it's not going to be easy.
are the three basic root causes of suffering in human life.
Greed is the leading cause
because greed is an inherent part of human nature.
You should be happy with what you already have.
Otherwise, the greed would manipulate you
into doing all the bad things
with no way out.
Your boundless beneficence.
You forgot something, didn't you?
-Forgot what? -Forgot to pay for the incenses.
Which ones?
$6.
$6 for three sticks?
$6 dollars per stick, so $18 in total.
Are you a robber or something?
How dare you call me a robber?
I'm a decent salesman.
I already knew that, but can I get a discount, please?
How much you got?
That's all. I didn't expect to spend more money in the pagoda.
Take it off!
I'm begging you. I spent over $200 on this watch.
Discount! I can buy it with $50.
How about $150?
A second-hand watch! $50 only!
Can I redeem my watch as soon as I have enough money?
Don’t move! Police! Police!
Turn around!
You're lucky, man.
This is an extremely dangerous criminal
who has been tricking people out of valuable items.
Hand me that watch.
Anything else in your belt bag?
Some personal stuff.
Hand me that bag too.
Good.
Caught you red-handed, the evidence is here too.
It's time to come the police station.
Why am I being arrested? I'm a victim.
The victim's testimony is required for investigation.
Huh?
Okay, sure.
You can go.
What are you looking at?
Okay, okay. Thank you.
Hold on.
You wait for a call from the station.
Then remember to show up to retrieve the evidence, okay?
Okay, okay.
Stand still!
Okay, cheers!
Two, three, cheers!
Here is your share.
What is it? Only $50?
Do me a favor this time, I'm badly in debt.
We're knight errants, it's common to be in debt.
How much is your debt anyway?
Over 50 grand.
You keep doing theses small tasks for $50 to $100 each,
how long until you pay off your debt?
Conning rich people will make more money. Right?
It will be no picnic, dude.
Bro, it's not my fault, it's hers.
Bitch! You ruined my hair.
This is the place we're drinking, not the place for your business.
I will fucking kill you.
That's not her intention.
You know how much this T-shirt costs, asshole?
You can't beat him.
How insolent!
Take it easy, bro. Your hair still looks good.
Get off of me!
-Calm down. -Have a seat.
Have a seat, please.
Come on.
I'll have my staff clean this mess up now.
Bring us a hotpot.
-Okay, right away. -Hey.
Take it and you can go home early.
-Thank you, sir. -Thank you, sir.
You gave away $20?
Now I understand why you're badly in debt.
They deserve to be helped.
Keep doing good things, luck will come to you.
How fast that luck comes!
Well, c'est la vie, you…
-This 89 eating house is really good. -Yes, sir.
Turn around and get out of here now.
Son of a bitch! You're fucking me, right?
-Take it easy, man. -Get out of here and play with me.
Can we do that here?
Are you challenging me? Challenge me!
Guys, go!
Jinx! Go find somewhere else then.
I'm sorry!
You motherfucker…
Those motherfuckers cheated me!
-Get them! -Run!
-Stop! -Stop, motherfuckers!
Split up! Run at your own pace!
Stop there!
How dare you scam me?
Scammer. Scammer.
-I will return your money. -No need.
Scam me? Scam me? Wanna scam?
-Where is the other guy? -Can't find him, sir.
Fuck!
Drag him along!
Find the other one. Messing with me was that prick's biggest mistake.
You have to pay $10 for this 50-cent balut
because you're sitting in a luxury villa inside a 5-star resort.
More importantly, using Furstenberg tableware to enjoy it.
It was rumored on the internet that you always seduce chicks.
Have you seen any chicks around me carrying bags worth thousands of dollars?
Drive million-dollar cars, build multimillion-dollar villas?
I don’t like seducing chicks.
I like seducing lads.
You're funny.
It would be our honor to have you, a million-dollar designer,
as a strategic partner.
I always consider three things before making the final decision.
Knowledge.
Experience. Enjoyment.
I understand.
What should I do now to win your trust?
Knowledge, I already had it.
Experience from small companies like yours,
I had them too.
The enjoyment with you… that's what I haven't had yet.
Should I say yes swiftly,
you may think I'm a docile and dissolute guy. Am I right?
You're wrong!
Your open-mindedness does not unveil the thing deep inside you.
Here.
This Rolex GMT-Master 2 costs around 15 grand.
Ironically, if people see this watch on my wrist,
they would think it's a fake one.
'Cause it does not suit me.
What are you doing?
To let you know that you deserve more than this watch.
Thai. I think we need more time for this.
Can we slow down?
Don't you have a timekeeping device on your wrist now?
Tonight I'm a top, you're a bottom.
And tomorrow?
I will be your strategic partner.
Get your kit off,
except the watch.
Pretty sexy that way.
Wanna be stimulated?
Let me.
You naughty boy.
We shouldn't skip the foreplay anyway.
Come on, babe.
That must be interesting.
Hold on.
Why rush it?
Who is this guy?
-My partner. -Partner on the bed?
Strategic partner.
-Who is this? -Long-term partner.
Betrayer.
-Tu, will you please help me explain this? -You honeydicked me.
I find no reasons to cooperate with you.
-Tu! -Tell me, how many partners do you have?
You pervert! I'm also your partner.
Why don't you bang me instead?
Strategic partner.
Strategic partner. Strategic partner.
Stop being weird, you prick. We don’t wanna attract the attention.
I'm so excited, that watch is a bargain indeed.
At least 15 grand. You got all the luck, man.
Thanks to your neglect.
How late for work were you?
It was not my fault.
Just noticed that I had forgotten the key when we were there.
You idiot!
Cash. As usual.
Okay, "get" go.
You must be really tired after a 22-hour flight, aren't you?
Well, yep. I still feel a bit jet-lagged now.
Couldn't even take a nap.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Listen up.
I have a secret and I was wondering if you would like to hear it?
What is your secret?
I'm the best at inducing sleep.
Oh, I just thought you’re good at awakening people, aren’t you?
Hello, sir and madam,
this is a 1998 Grand Vin de Chateau Latour wine.
You're a lovely couple. Enjoy your meal.
Thank you very much.
Is he speaking in French?
Yes, he is.
I'm a Vietnamese American.
I can speak seven foreign languages including American, if you need.
Please speak Vietnamese.
My boss asked me to bring Mr. Tu this bottle of wine.
May I know why?
My boss owes much to Mr. Tu.
This restaurant wouldn't exist without Mr. Tu.
You're flattering me.
Please give Mr. Hung my regards.
Do you want to share with me what you have done to help the owner of this restaurant?
Not a big deal at all.
Mr. Hung is Vietnamese French.
He was tricked into buying non-residential lot when he just returned to Vietnam.
Then he asked me to help him out.
I introduced him to another lot.
It was pretty good, affordable.
Much more room for sustainable growth.
Actually, we're sitting on that place.
All right, listen up.
I was about to invest in land here, honestly.
Didn't expect to see an expert like you here.
What would they call this circumstance?
Oh, my God!
Tu, someone fainted over there.
Someone fainted.
What's happening?
Back off, back off.
-What happened? -I'm starved.
Can anyone give me some food?
Yeah, I have food.
Please take this lobster.
Here.
-Thank you. -Stop!
That lobster would kill him instantly.
Oh, dear.
My lobster…
I have seen this before.
Starvation must be the cause.
He's right. I'm starved.
It will move to a colon spasm in less than five minutes.
He looks fine, right?
Seriously? Is he acting?
-Hey, it's not happened yet. -He's acting, I guess.
I got a gut ache!
Then my diagnosis is accurate. Everyone, back off.
Give him some space to breathe.
Are you okay?
Hypoglycemia is the next symptom, in addition to cramps in his upper body.
What is hypoglycemia?
Everyone, calm down. It's also a symptom of tetanus.
One of his legs will raise.
And then both legs.
How strange. How strange.
This is it. He'll run on empty very quickly.
Take him to the hospital now.
Let's go.
Take him to the hospital!
Tu, you call an ambulance.
Too late, I will drive him to the hospital.
No need to go to the hospital, just give me food, please.
Hold on, Tu.
Here.
Take it to pay for the hospital.
You're so kind.
I gotta go. See you around.
You acted too fast for me to stop back then.
I truly got hypoglycemia.
I just needed food.
You can give me the $250 that that lady gave you.
I'll go buy food myself.
Lucky for you, I'm a doctor.
I already examined you, so don’t worry.
You don't have any symptoms.
Hey, bro. My blood sugar level is low indeed.
Hypoglycemia usually causes shakiness, generalized hyperhidrosis.
Yes, it's right.
Your body, on the other hand, is hecking dry.
Heartbeat may be very fast too.
You had spasms, but the heartbeat was very stable.
Not too slow, not too fast.
And finally, Hypoglycemia will cause temporary visual impairment.
How do you know Ms. Trang gave me $250?
To sum up, you're not a patient.
You're… the… con… artist.
Are you a doctor or the police?
Of course I'm a doctor.
And we're on the way to the police station.
Holy shit.
I swear I'm not a bad person.
I'm dead broke so I just wanna look for a free meal.
This is an island where decent and upstanding people live.
You're not allowed to smear it.
I will do whatever you want me to do.
Please don't drive me to the police station.
How much money do you have in your pocket?
Around $100.
This is the earliest flight to Saigon.
Window seat, lunch included.
You're really going this far?
I wanna ensure you won't be cheating anyone out of anything.
This is the best way.
If you used all my money for a plane ticket,
then how will I survive in Saigon?
My boy!
On the plane or in prison? You pick.
Godspeed.
Hey, babe. Hey, tanned.
What is that?
Hi. My name is Thai.
Are you acquainted with Tu?
-You meant Dr. Tu? -Nope. Director Tu.
A director of a construction firm.
Director of a construction firm?
Ah, he's my cousin.
Tu shared a confidence with me.
He said that he had a crush on a designer
and that the guy would be his dream boy.
He intended to take this cooperation opportunity
to declare his feelings for you.
Notwithstanding, you'll only looked for a fling eventually.
So what's next?
I-- I gotta go back downtown.
-Or… -I'm quite busy, so I do hope you understand.
It's not my place to interfere in his affairs anyway.
But the truth is he's my cousin so,
I'm counting on you.
You will get everything you want
if you persuade Tu to forgive me.
To do that,
we need time, and your investment.
Take care, my brother-in-law.
I will write a poem for you.
You can count on me.
My name is Tu.
What's your name?
I'm Thu Cuc.
But, don't even think about hitting on me.
Just because I don't like a cub.
That's not what I meant really.
I was passing by and saw a strawberry quartz on your wrist.
Your countenance tells me that
you were born in the Bing-Yin Tiger year. Oven fire element.
Today is a bad day for a Bing-Yin Tiger horoscope.
You should beware of water.
I don’t think I will swim in the pool tonight.
Neither go to the beach.
Sorry for disappointing you.
Let's see how to properly jump into the pool.
He jumped into the pool!
I'm so sorry.
Man proposes…
God disposes.
Your Yin Tang acupuncture is kinda dark.
The Property Palace in the palm of your hand is slightly sunken.
I'm afraid you would have a misfortune
regarding the Property Palace in the next few days.
However, you won't believe in what I said anyway.
So I'll let you enjoy your drink alone.
Bait taken.
You're too young to have that vast knowledge of feng shui.
I did intend to invest in real estate here.
I'm having a problem right now.
Do you have a solution for this?
Not hard anymore, if you have me here.
Do you know 90% of our Feng Shui clients are property investors?
-I have a lot… -Hello?
Tu.
Your brother is here.
Tu!
Someone call the security guard!
Do you know how difficult it was to look for you?
You left me alone all the time.
Who is he, Tu?
He is my brother, do not make him yours.
Please don’t take him from me.
What is it?
I suppose you should take care of him first. Ah.
We can discuss our business later.
-Cuc. -You're too bad.
You locked me up for three days, starved me.
-I'm starved. -Look at him!
Yummy, yummy.
Tu!
How can you treat your brother like that?
Guys, this man might have a reason for doing that.
He cannot be that bad.
Then why did he starve his brother?
And why lock him up for three days?
-Right… -Such a sarcasm!
-One is ugly, one is wicked. -Right…
Yeah, unacceptable.
So despicable.
No more business between us, you hear me?
Be human before you become an expert.
Stop doing business with him.
-You're too bad. -How wicked he is!
-You're too bad. -Bury him!
Yes, my bad.
My brother got bad karma,
because I had disclosured God's wills.
The day I achieved gnosis,
is the day my brother got a 45 Celsius degree fever
for one week.
He acts like a five-year-old kid.
He had to stay in the hospital.
Hospital expenses. Medicine costs. How did I pay the expenses?
Where did I get the money?
Right.
I'm a gigolo.
How honest he is!
Feng Shui master is just my part-time job.
Gigolo is my regular job.
So, she is your…
Oh, this lady is asking him to…
I'm… I'm…
I had to do this job…
because I love my family.
I need money to look after my own family.
Money for my brother. Have I done something wrong?
Can you tell me?
Khoa, I was too engaged in work
to realize that…
how much you needed me.
You need your own brother.
Brother!
Brother!
He has a reason!
Don't blame him!
We're even now.
How miserable they are!
Everybody!
We all must do something to help Tu and his brother.
We should do it now,
otherwise Khoa may follow in his brother's footsteps one day.
Correct.
I will donate $150.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Many a little makes a mickle.
Thank you very much.
Tu.
I almost misread you.
I didn't know you had a difficult background.
I will help you.
Please express our gratitude to the last customer of Tu.
No, I'm not his customer. I meant I will donate $250 for hospital expenses.
That's very kind of you, your boundless beneficence.
We still have many difficult situations like him out there.
Anyone else? Help my brother, please.
Thank you.
Can you get Tu's phone number for me please?
Right away, sir.
Take this money and get the fuck out of here now.
This is our place. You heard me?
I was a part of this.
We could get ten times this money without you, fucking spoilsport!
We have nearly a grand here.
Ten times this money means thousands of dollars, right?
You bet!
What are you up to?
Boss! Can I join your gang?
How many times have you spoiled my business today?
You better fuck off now or I have to use the hard way.
I beg you guys.
Please give me a chance.
What a stubborn freak!
I'm broke and badly in debt.
Not a chance to see my mom and daughter again
if I'm unable to pay off my debt.
I beg you guys.
I bow down to beg you.
All right.
Let's go, Tu.
Wait.
Have you changed your mind?
You wanna join us?
Fine. But…
return their wallets first.
What the heck? Not only a bad appearance but also a bad habit.
He's fucking fast.
Just so you know, your pilferage did not surprise us at all.
Uncle Nam and I just wanted to test your skill.
That trick wouldn't even work with Tu.
He took my wallet too.
Tu wanted to test you too.
Apology, my bad habit.
Go.
"Go" means you asked him to go away or to go with us?
-I don't get it. -Support me, please.
Tu, what do you mean?
How can an elegant man like you live in this shabby place?
No swindler owns a house.
Instead of a house…
we must have a solid base.
Pretty cool.
Is it cool? Shut your mouth.
Now smile.
Done. Okay.
Men Malay costume expert cum IT.
She gets 20% once the mission is complete.
You're not pretty so I doubt you can make others look pretty.
Making you look pretty is impossible. Go over there please.
Uncle Nam, transporter, he can ride all means of transportation on all terrains.
He will get the same 20% after a complete mission.
Hi there.
Can you ride a MILF?
My ex-spouse is 12 years older than me. How so?
You're a hecking awesome "rider". Share with me your experience.
Your taste is weird.
Uncle Nam, toss it out.
I just had a sip.
Here.
Men Malay and Uncle Nam get 20% each per mission, then you get the 60% left?
Don't you think it's too much?
Nope, I'm a leader,
I must plan for everything so as to ensure the mission is accomplished.
You can be a leader if you want.
No, thanks.
Have you ever failed?
I have not failed for 28 years.
I only undertake a mission if the success is certain.
Brilliant!
On the other hand, I've completely failed for 29 years.
Well, it means you're older than me?
How do you want to be addressed?
That's not important, I only care about your behavior.
Call me whatever you want.
How about my share per complete mission?
Like I said, we cannot trust this freak.
I don’t care how much is his share,
but I will kill you if it affects my share.
No soft drink.
Okay.
Same to me, my share is untouchable.
All right, let me think.
Which day of the week is it today?
Tuesday.
Then your share is 3%.
Can we use day of the month instead?
Today is the 10th day of the month, so 10%.
Number 10 is a round and lucky number.
It's the same as a 10-point grade system.
I will help the gangget 10 point, perfect result.
How smooth-tongued you are, dude.
Let's talk about that later, you should learn first.
Can't wait! Where do we start?
Start from scratch.
Everyone, line up here.
The hotel is nice!
Now we will check in, get some rest and join the free activities for tonight.
The best target is the one
that has many serious drawbacks.
What are their drawbacks?
How about going to the spa inside our hotel?
Hey, have you lost your mind?
Spa service in a luxurious hotel is usually costly.
Or we're going to a spa in the night market?
We can save money for other stuff. Right?
-Cheap is preferred. -Yeah. Right.
Miserly, indecent.
Correct, but not enough.
Naive tourists like them is a key to our success.
So, who would be our first ideal target?
The older sister?
TikToker?
Then who?
Your flag.
My bad.
-Excuse me. -Yes?
Are you a tour guide?
I am.
-Can you speak Chinese? -Nope.
So, where is your hometown and can I follow you home?
What?
Oh, sorry, it's just my parents told me to follow my dreams.
Cheers!
They want a low-cost tour, and also free-of-charge services.
Guiding that group
was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
It felt like putting some underwear on my head.
I cannot do anything with the underwear on your head.
But I can take care of the other one on your intimate parts.
Cheers!
-Fuck the tour. -Yep.
-Fuck the responsibility. -Yep.
-No work tomorrow. -Yep.
-You only live once. -Yep.
Is it perfect?
Terrific!
Conning without thorough preparation is the same as gambling.
And I hate gambling.
Ah, I inserted it contrariwise.
We should insert it here down to the chin, at the silicone's edge.
All right, give it a try.
I hate gambling. Should I wanna do something, I will do it best.
Welcome to Safaray zoo!
Hi, everyone!
Now the entry ticket is only $12 per person.
Wow, only $12 per person?
So why didn't we come here in the first place?
Hey, $12 only. Cool, right?
The companion of your expedition here is Mr. Vu Minh Kha,
a professional tour guide at Safaray!
Hello, hello!
Safaray is the perfect choice.
There are lots of wild animals here, especially predators.
We have walked 0.6 miles so far, and we must walk over six miles more.
Pardon me? What?
No animals here. Can't even see a fly!
We must go deep inside.
Kha, I'm exhausted, can't even feel my legs anymore. I'm not gonna make it.
-What is that noise? -Right. We should go home.
That must be predators, they are hunting.
Everyone, calm down.
What is it?
This "predator" looks awesome!
You scared us out of our wits!
-Who is he? -I proudly present to everyone,
Mr. Nam Tiger, the zookeeper.
Oh, God! My heart!
Everyone should stay together.
Those predators usually attack the prey that are separate.
Your family must be the luckiest family in the world.
You will have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see the last tiger in this zoo.
Lucky, my ass.
I encountered him once, he was that bad.
What a relief. I dealt with him using this arm.
-Really? -How about the other one?
He took it away.
They would accept any of our requests
when they take the bait. You know what I meant?
Go back to the hotel now.
Relax.
We are in the middle of the forest, so pickup service will be surcharged.
How much?
We don’t care how much does it cost, just call the car.
Call it now. Get us out of here, soon.
Okay. The special service charge is $200 per person.
-Excuse me? -$200 per person, that's inflated!
I'm so sorry, but this is the company rule.
No payment, no car.
There was no prenotification ealier.
Why only now?
What if they choose money over their lives?
Goddammit! What a tough player!
Plan D, the final shot.
Okay, okay.
You waned, old man.
-My turn. -You're old. My turn.
Hurry, everyone.
Be strong, everyone.
Oh, my God, are you kidding?
My gosh.
-Come on, quickly. -Everybody!
What is going on?
Something strange?
Our family is lucky again.
You guys are looking at the last Hubabi clan in this forest.
A genuine hunter-gatherer community.
What do they hunt here, Uncle Nam?
Deer, other animals, and so on.
Uncle Nam! What do they hunt if they cannot find any deer to hunt?
Come on, everyone!
Call the car now!
Only $200 per person.
Discount, please!
Here is your money.
Thank you.
Pay for me! I'm messed up!
Guys, Hai, run! Wait for me.
Nam, Nam!
Don't worry, I'm here!
Grab my hand.
Run!
Run!
-Mr. Nam. -Run!
-Nam! -Don't worry about me!
-Nam! -Run!
Run!
Nam!
Thank you, Mr. Nam.
Your money.
Thank you so much!
I deducted $5.
Why?
For stabbing me too hard.
You want the full payment,
-lie down for me to stab your back. -Come on!
Let me stab your back now!
$2,000 in that box.
You told me 150$ per person the other day.
They would say yes to everything in that moment.
How greedy!
Tu is gonna skin you if he knows, I swear.
You'd better be careful.
I understand.
Here is another $1,000.
Where did you get it?
This is bereavement money for Uncle Nam's funeral from Ms. Hai.
Can you do like I do?
It's boom time for him.
Next target is a black pearl.
Gosh, this place is crowded. I doubt we can win the auction.
Whatever you want I will get it for you, even if it's a star.
Excuse me.
What can I do for you, sir and ma'am?
We're looking for a hall where a pearl ring called the Hidden Gem is on auction.
It's in E5 Hall. Please follow me, sir.
Shall we?
Hey, you. My apologies.
You called me, sir?
I…
-Who the hell are you? -Security guard.
Can I help you?
I'm the security captain.
-Shoot. -Tell me where is your position.
-Rooftop. -There is no one there.
Right. Had nothing to do then I went down
and ran into this couple while they were looking for the auction hall.
It's not our duty.
Which team are you in?
Plan B.
Team 5.
We only have four teams in total, you said you're in…
God, my bad.
Apologies.
-No worries. -My bad.
Let me clean that up.
-I got this. -No, it's my fault.
-I got this, okay? -No.
-I said I got this. -Let me do it.
I'm so sorry.
You're wet. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean it!
It's too slippery!
Oh, shit! What have you done? Goddammit!
Oh, shit! What have you done? Goddammit! Slippery floor! Sir!
Sir, let me help you with your pants.
Follow me, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen.
We proudly present the next item at the auction today.
A masterpiece that was born in the deep sea.
Hidden Gem, the pearl ring.
A ring with a pearl on top collected
from the record-breaking ocean depth in Vietnam.
And we proudly present to you
the owner of the ring,
Mr. Pierre Tu Mac.
The opening bid is $25,000.
The minimum bid increment is $2,500.
$27,500.
$30,000.
$35,000.
$40,000.
$40,000 from gentleman number 6.
$42,500.
$50,000.
Wonderful. $50,000 from lady number 9, Ms. Jennifer Vu.
$50,000, going once.
-Honey! -Going twice.
$52,500.
$55,000.
Sweetheart. Just give up.
You cannot win anyway.
$60,000.
Oh, my goodness. $60,000.
$60,000, going once.
Going twice.
$70,000.
$70,000, going once.
Going twice.
Going triple.
Congratulations! Ms. Jennifer Vu has become the new owner…
I checked his cashflow.
He would buy the ring if the price is around $45,000 to $50,000.
Hey, he spoils his girlfriend a lot.
Why don’t you set the opening bid higher?
That'd be a bit risky.
I have an idea.
During the bidding, Men Malay will try to push the price up until he gives up.
Then we will know the maximum price he's willing to pay.
And?
Bao Ngoc!
Bao Ngoc!
You stay there. Leave me alone.
Bao Ngoc! Bao Ngoc!
My goodness! What the hell is going here, Khoa?
Ms. Jennifer has requested a delay in payment for one week.
Disagree. We all have confirmed that the payment
would be settled in cash in 24 hour.
Why do you two try to make this hard?
The international wire transfer always takes more time
to process than a normal transfer.
I do not bilk. So do not make it hard.
Sorry, but I'm not making anything hard here.
I need money now for a personal matter.
I informed you of the payment terms
before the auction and you agreed with it.
I don't want any trouble, right?
Excuse me. I heard that you guys are having a problem with the payment?
It's none of your concern. We're discussing it, can you please leave?
Relax.
I have $60,000 in cash.
I was wondering if you're still interested in the ring.
Will you please show me your respect?
Pardon me, Ms. Jennifer.
You're the one who did not respect our terms.
Fuck your goddamn pearl! I don't need it.
I really like decisive people like you.
Deal!
$60,000, not a penny more, not a penny less.
Don't worry, just show me the ring.
Here you go.
It's beautiful.
I should have told you this.
I invited Mr. Daniel Tran who is a pearl appraiser here today.
Don't get me wrong.
$60,000 is a large amount of money, so this is necessary I guess.
Mr. Daniel, please.
Thanh Hoa!
Thanh Hoa!
Sir, your flowers.
Oh, baby, why didn't you tell me?
I'm really surprised. How sweet!
We offer this special service to you as a thank you.
Congratulations on tying the knot!
Hey. Appraisal is not needed right now.
All you need to do is to kneel.
Kiss her, kiss her…
Hey. I don't want to jinx us.
What if he knows that the ring is counterfeit?
The final step. Exit door.
What does "exit door" means?
That's the most important step in every conning mission.
To distinguish an expert from an amateur.
How so?
We always prepare a way out for us, no matter what happens.
Just don't get caught, then better luck next time.
Kiss her, kiss her…
Cheers!
Thank you, everyone.
My life has been full of failures before I met you guys.
I didn't have any luck either.
Now working with you guys is my biggest luck.
Don't think I can bear a cheesy speech from your mouth.
You can call this destiny.
Right. Everyone has their own destiny.
Your Uncle Nam had a pretty tough destiny.
Today I will tell you about my life.
-No need to tell us. -Right, no need to tell us.
I'm feeling pretty chilled, let me tell him.
-No need. -You don't need to tell him.
He is the new member, he should know more about the others.
He is the new member, he should know more about the others.
-Cheers! -Don’t be rude like that.
We're a team, we should know each other.
You two always stop me whenever I wanna talk about my life.
Oh.
Why don't you two let him talk? He feels slighted.
-Don’t worry. -Don’t worry.
He always wants to talk about his life whenever we drink.
-Come on, cheers. -Cheers.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
Hello, hello.
God, I didn't expect he would do this.
Fifteen years ago, there was a good-looking man.
He feared no danger.
He feared no hardship.
He delivered joy to people day by day.
-What did you do? -Tobacco smuggling.
Correct.
I worked very hard day and night to look after my wife and kid.
One day, one of my transports went wrong.
My legs were broken.
Plus seven years in jail.
My wife couldn't stand that suffering, then she decided to remarry.
Khoa. Do you think I felt sad?
-Sad, of course. -I didn't.
'Cause I knew it was my destiny.
I have never blamed her.
Then I got out of jail,
I tried to make as much money as I could
to make it up to my son.
I worked like a dog.
Ironically, that fucking destiny kept clinging to me like a leech.
One day he fell sick
and I arranged to transfuse my blood to him.
That was the time I found out he was not my son.
He is not my son.
Why?
Who can answer me?
Why he is not my son?
Uncle Nam! Nam!
-It's alright. -Leave uncle Nam alone.
Only the ocean water
-can stop Uncle Nam's tears now. -Why is he not my son?
Why?
I'm an orphan.
You too?
I lived in an orphanage as a kid.
There were a couple who came to adopt a child,
they wavered between me and my friend.
That night we hugged each other and cried on the bed.
She told me I should be adopted
so that I could return to the orphanage to visit her regularly.
What a good friend.
Yep, pretty fucking good.
In the morning the day after,
she told me she would pretend to be sick
and I could go to the living room alone.
Then I went to the living room and told the nuns what she had said.
When I was about to be adopted by that couple,
she came with another nun,
then she pointed her finger at me saying that
I lied to her and intentionally locked her up so that I could get adopted.
Good friend, my ass.
Done. I was an orphan again.
Then I became a liar and nobody believed me anymore.
I was obsessed by those despised looks, those disgraceful comments.
Finally I climbed over the fence
and have been living on my own since then.
You're next. Tell us.
Khoa, where is he?
Sir! Sir, Please! I'm begging you!
He's gone.
Where is he?
Sir, please!
Sir!
Sir! Sir!
I'm begging you! Sir!
I'm begging you! Sir!
My business failed and I ended up deep in debt.
My presence at home brought
my mom…
and my kid…
misery every day.
Shit, you're too late! Get in!
I'm sorry.
We can go now.
Dad!
-Linh! -Dad!
-Wait! -Dad.
Linh.
Dad!
Linh.
Dad.
You must go, don't you?
Dad, I have this for you.
Come on, man. Go or stay? Hurry up.
Go!
Let's go!
Dad!
Dad!
Linh!
Dad.
Dad!
Oh, dear. Your life is way darker than your skin.
Cheers!
Destiny!
You're nothing!
You once pushed me down to the ground,
but today I must thank you for giving me these friends.
Everyone has their own wishes In their lives
Whenever they feel sad or hard done by
Sometimes we want to share Our memories
Please always keep this friendship in mind
Call my name, my dear friends
It will help you stay wide awake.
Your beer drinking skills are bad, huh?
These two glasses are for you, you shit.
Have a seat, I'll go buy some beers.
No, no.
Enough.
Too bad!
-Tu. -What?
Can you do me a favor?
What is it?
When will you raise my share?
We have earned a lot of money so far.
I'm gonna do everything you want me to do
as long as I have enough money to pay off my debt.
A piece of cake.
Just show me you're worthy.
Among the targets whom we are looking into,
I have successfully picked the two biggest and best targest.
Well, you planned all of this.
What a greedy man!
You should be happy when your student learns well.
Well done.
BLOOD TYPE: B CEO OF THIEN NGOC KIM KHANH JSC
Boring!
You have chips but can't play.
It looks like you need a gamer to play, right?
May I join you?
Deal.
You guys look unfamiliar here.
We own a small company overseas,
coming back to Vietnam this time for business and vacation.
Wow, successful at your age!
How about you?
Well, I'm the owner of a small cosmetic company named Thien Ngoc Kim Khanh.
Guarantee 100% return on investment within a year.
How can you call that a small company?
Have you researched my company?
We have just Googled it.
Cute and clever.
You're absolutely my type, you should know that.
But I'm not gonna go easy on you at the poker table.
Yes.
The directors of the event company will land at 10:00 AM tomorrow.
I will reschedule all the meetings to the afternoon, it is okay?
Keep the meeting with the event company only.
Remember to set the stage properly, this is our big event.
Yes.
Let's finish here, okay?
Okay, call.
I really wanna know what are your hole cards
that make you confident like that.
Two gamers.
Wow, a full house with nine pair.
Outstanding.
I lost.
Okay, it's all for today.
Hey, I will keep an eye on you guys.
Rematch someday, okay?
-Yes. -Go.
I intentionally used all-in to force you show your hole cards.
But you didn't let me know till the end?
I promise you, should we have a rematch in the near future,
I will show you my hole cards.
-Okay? -Drive safe.
Good morning, sir.
We are staff of Thien Ngoc Minh Khanh.
This event is very important to our company and Ms. Khanh herself,
so she has prepared a distinguished working place for you two.
"Primal beauty" is the main theme of this event
and through this event we would like to dignify primeval value that human beings receive from nature.
No cellphones, no internet, no other electronic devices.
We will keep your luggage
and will come back to pick you up in the next 30 days.
You two will stay here to discover all the primal beauty on this island,
Then please think how to create a unique event in Vietnam.
Otherwise?
Otherwise, we will send you guys back to Hanoi immediately.
Amazing!
We have waited for a client like Ms. Khanh for so long.
We're not gonna return to the mainland
if this event is not the best one in Vietnam.
Exactly.
It was with winds that waves began
But where did they begin, the winds?
Neither do I remember now
When did it all begin, our love?
See you again.
Why have they not showed up yet?
I contacted them all morning, but couldn't reach them.
You call this professional?
Gentle greet, my Lucy.
Hey.
-How? -Hey.
You two still remember me?
-How can we not remember you? -Hello.
It was an accident only.
I unintentionally heard that
your company is an event company, is it true?
Yes, our company is based overseas,
but we also intend to expand our business activity to Vietnam.
Ah, please take my business card.
Thank you.
You can scan the QR code on the card to see our company profile.
Okay.
Brilliant indeed. I was right about you two.
You're flattering us.
I'm a straight person, so I don't like beating around the bush.
We're about to hold an incentive paying event here.
It's expected to happen in the next four weeks.
Are you interested in working with our company this time?
May we know the scale of your event?
Frankly we normally do large-scale events only,
for the small-scale events we're afraid…
The expected budget for this event is around $1.5 million.
-Pardon? -$1.5 million.
Could you please excuse us for a second?
What?
It's not the right time to be excited.
She is looking at us now.
You must pretend that we're debating her suggestion.
And more importantly, we don’t let them know what we're thinking.
Got it.
Last Friday, who massaged you?
It was Huong.
Did she do well?
Damn, she did very good. How about you?
Hung "beard".
Fuck him, I still don't understand why Ms. Dao sent him to massage me?
I guess sometimes you should experience another massager's skills.
Are you crazy?
He has halitosis, it's terrible.
Unacceptable.
It seems our suggestion is not okay with them.
What do you think?
Let's see.
-Overacted. -Did I overact?
-Yep. Act normally. -How about now?
Be serious.
Now listen to me.
Take a deep breath…
keep your head up…
and turn left.
Go.
-Yes. -Sis.
-To be honest… -Allow me to chime in.
I have just decided to increase the budget to $2 million
and 10% of the contract value will be transferred once the proposal is approved.
With that budget I think…
$2.5 million.
We have so many things to do for this event.
All those things must be done in only four weeks.
$2.5 million is not a fixed number.
We will come up with an exact number after a more thorough discussion.
Take your time to think about it and call us later.
We're on vacation anyway.
See you around.
What the heck are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
Trust me this time.
$2 million only, you idiot!
Wait!
I really like you two.
I agree! $2.5 million.
Hello, everyone.
Now I would like to present
an unprecedented event in our S-shaped country.
The event's theme is about primal beauty.
I just want to ensure that the event would be awesome.
Please allow me to introduce you to a supercar trader, Mr. Johnny Nguyen.
I can tell you about carriage, wagon,
but supercar, I'm out.
I have not ever driven any.
What would I present to them?
Now it's time for research. I will test you regularly.
Oh, dear.
As per your request,
I've finished all required paperwork
to import three cars.
The first one, a Lamborghini Huracan with V10 engine.
580 HP, engine displacement 5.9L.
Price $700,000.
The next one,
a Ferrari 488 Pista, price $400,000.
And the final one, a Porsche Cayenne, price $200,000.
These three cars are expected to arrive at the port in the next five days.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Johnny Nguyen.
Ladies and gentlemen, you can tell an event good or bad
by having a look at the menu.
Now I proudly introduce to everyone, the 2015 Indonesian MasterChef.
A 3-star Michelin chef.
Ms. Luvita Gudino.
What a coincidence! I can speak Indonesian.
Where are you from?
I'm from Semarang.
Can I play a foreigner?
Why are you so demanding?
Why are you so dumb?
A foreign chef is more superior,
it will help us gain the target's trust. Understand?
So what nationality you prefer?
Indonesian.
You should choose Malaysian.
Then a Malaysian Indonesian.
That's our capital and also a tourist attraction,
but for me, that place is filled with childhood memories.
To ensure she trusts us and deposit $250,000 with us,
what we have planned is not enough.
Did you miss something?
The stage.
You're smarter.
That's how we design, build the stage, and the workflow of this show.
Good idea!
Money, money.
Have a look at your fruit.
Smell good?
We want our share.
We'll share it after the meal.
-One by one. -Okay, okay. Eat fast.
-Malay, give me the shrimp. -No money, no shrimp.
-Uncle Nam. -My arms are paralyzed, don't ask me.
Goddamn you two.
Everyone, I have a game, do you want to play?
-Is it fun? -Yup!
Okay.
His face looks trustful.
I have two envelopes here.
If I say one of them is twice the other
and you can change, will you change it?
I won't change.
Money is secured in my hand, change it for what?
I will change, why I do that?
$50 is equal to twice $25, right?
$100 is equal to twice $50.
What if I lose? What have I lost?
I lost only $25, but if I win, what would I win?
I win $100.
Then I will change.
Open it, open it.
Double it! It's $100.
That's twice.
What do you think if it is tenfold?
We use $250,000 to make a real big event
so that we end up getting $2.5 million from her.
Are you in or out?
I'm in.
I would get enough money to go to Korea for a boob job
and other surgeries also, if possible.
I'm in too.
I need money for the home that I have dreamt of for so long.
All in!
-All in. -All in. Cheers!
-Korea, wait for me. -Cheers!
-Uncle Nam. -Cheers!
Make a plan, Khoa.
Thank you. Cheers.
I've already planned everything,
we would get that $2.5 million if we stick to the plan.
It's kinda risky though.
Let me do this, I need this money.
I thought that $250,000 will help you pay off the debt.
Yeah, but I still need money for my daughter.
This is the final catch, then I will go home for good.
Let me think, but this mission is very risky.
I will find you another one.
Do you fear failure?
You're confident all the time,
but deep in your heart you fear failure.
Can you keep your mouth shut?
What the fuck do you know, huh, you goddamn loser?
I told you. I don’t belive in this shit.
I won't!
You don’t believe in my plan or in me?
Why did you let me join the team while you don't believe in me? Huh?
You don't believe me, fine!
But do you really want them going with you to deceive people
for the rest of their lives?
One scam is counted, ten scams are counted.
Why don’t you let us move to the next chapter?
You're selfish.
You only wanna be in your safe zone
to enjoy the feeling of victory alone.
You don't even care about the others!
Tu.
We're family, why are we yelling at each other?
I don't care about the dream house anymore.
What I care about now is that you guys are happy.
That's correct. Happy is our goal.
I changed my mind, I'm not going to Korea.
I know a plastic surgeon in Long An province, low-cost surgery,
then I can have a boob job there.
You two don't have to argue with each other about the money.
We are family.
That's the paramount issue.
Tu, back to your seat and drink.
Right. It's okay to save your dream today for tomorrow.
Now we get more wine, more beer to have fun…
Stop!
Tomorrow…
I need your detailed plan.
Khoa!
Who locked this door?
Khoa, Khoa.
-Uncle Nam. -Hey, not me.
He looked at you. He didn't look at me to ask.
-Uncle Nam! -He kept the key.
-I left it in the car. -You again?
You come in here. You must drink three glasses of wine.
-Down to the last drop, you hear me? -I must be dead.
-Down to the last drop. -I'll get drunk!
-Cheers! -Cheers!
Hello?
Excuse me, I need to take this.
Bottoms up.
I know.
It looks like the fish here can understand human.
Of course not. I'm good.
Good? Come on.
You can tell me anything.
Honestly, 10% of the contract value paid in advance is not enough.
The contract is only a document to confirm our commitments.
To ensure the project is on track,
we have to pay our vendors 80% in advance on our end.
The timeline is too tight for us to manage the money.
I'll help you, okay?
It can't be.
This is our first collaboration, the contract has been signed already.
You said the contract is just to confirm our commitments.
Right?
How about this?
I will ask the board of directors to come with me to observe your preparation.
Try to show us the best demo of the event.
Based on your work,
I can convince the board to pay your company
the remaining 90% of the contract value.
Then your company can do whatever you want for the event.
Really?
Oh, dear! You're so kind to us.
Deal?
Thank you so much!
I promise I will go to any lengths to do this event.
One, two, three, cheers!
Khoa! Come here and sign the contract.
Khoa. Sign it.
Wait. You should count it.
No need.
You trusted us and agreed to pay in full in advance,
then we must trust you in return.
Good collaboration.
Good collaboration.
-Sister Khanh! -Thu Cuc!
Hello, sis.
-Oh, boy, I have waited for you. -Yes.
-You good? -I'm good.
Okay.
-I saw her. -That's Khoa and Tu.
You should become Tu the gigolo again.
Are you nuts?
They organized the incentive paying event of my company.
Over $2 million of mine.
A foreign company, specializing in large-scale events planning.
They’re so close.
I know. Let me think.
-So handsome. -Oh really?
Let me introduce them!
-Pickaboo. -What the hell are you doing?
This is how we celebrate after signing a contract.
-Rave it up. -Rave it up.
-Rave it up. -Rave it up.
Khoa.
Let’s hop on the bus.
Let's go around.
Tu gigolo!
And his retarded brother.
What does it mean?
A Feng Shui master prostitues himself to raise his brother.
Why did you become an owner of an event company today?
Thu Cuc!
Long time no see, Thu Cuc.
What did you come here for?
To punch you two scammers in your faces.
It’s not like what Thu Cuc said.
This is a long story.
We shouldn't tell a long story.
Rave it up!
Watch out!
Oh, my God. My money.
Scammers.
Oh, dear. Scammers.
My God!
My money!
Excuse me, sir.
Are you okay? I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Run, run.
Over there.
Get them.
Stop there!
Hey, my motorbike.
It's mine. It's mine.
-Thief. Thief. -Thief.
-Thief. -It’s mine.
-Thief. -Thief.
Motherfuckers!
Stop right now!
Stop, scammers!
Stop!
Hey! Stop now!
Motherfuckers! Stop!
Get the fuck out of here.
Move! You fucking move now!
You better watch out!
You good?
We're good?
A boat will arrive in the next ten minutes.
So we leave here for good?
We can stay anywhere with this money.
Hold on.
Can you open the suitcase and show me $2 million?
I have never seen that large amount of money in my life.
Khoa, open it please.
Wait, wait.
-What is this? -Tu!
What is it?
They set me up.
Uncle Nam.
You guys want this?
Then take it.
That's not what I want.
He wants something else.
What you want is
to see my team steal the money in public.
Am I right, Ms. Khanh?
Brilliant, brilliant.
You deduced my plan quickly.
Only a senior swindler can do so.
It turns out that you're also a hustler.
Exactly.
I wanna teach you guys a lesson.
Women scam people better than men do.
Because men always think they're smarter.
He is my brother, do not make him yours.
Please don’t take him from me.
What is it?
We won't have enough money for our incentive paying event
if you keep throwing money around.
Not enough? Fine. I don't care.
I know how to turn $250,000 into $2.5 million.
I intentionally used All-in to force you to show your hole cards.
But you didn't let me know till the end?
Greedy boy!
You won and you still want to see my hole cards.
To be frank, I like you guys very much.
Looking at you…
I have a feeling that you guys are younger versions of me.
Enthusiatic. Eager.
But immature.
Tu! Run!
-Run faster, everyone. -Get them.
Stop!
Ms. Khanh, if you want to take one of us,
then take me only.
I swear on my life,
I will keep this under my hat.
These kids will leave the island today.
Is it okay, Ms. Khanh?
You should know one thing, old man.
Only the dead can keep silent.
-Uncle Nam! -Uncle Nam!
Jump!
Come on, Khoa!
Useless!
If they're dead, I wanna see their bodies.
Go.
Uncle Nam.
Khoa! Tu!
Open your eyes and look at me.
Khoa! Go find a vehicle. Khoa!
Are you deaf?
I just wanna do the last mission.
Last mission?
Look at Uncle Nam over there!
It's all your fault. Because of your greed.
You're greedy for money.
I'm the only one who is greedy for money?
How about Uncle Nam?
And Men Malay?
You… you get the biggest share among us!
Asshole! Are you fucking crazy?
Uncle Nam is dying.
Tu!
Fuck off, you son of a bitch!
I have prepared this for you.
Go.
I'm sorry.
For what?
If it's not your fault, what are you sorry for?
You're right.
I'm the one who fear failure.
The scariest thing after you fail is that
you don't know how to face up to that failure.
What would you do?
Keep going where I failed.
They're gonna kill you.
So running away like you would be the best way?
Fuck you! I don’t wanna flee.
I still have my mom and a child at home waiting for me.
Don't use your family as an excuse. That's cowardly.
I'm a coward. Fine.
It's still better than having to tell my daughter that
this is money I got from deceiving people, you feel free to spend it.
Fuck! You still don't understand, do you?
If you win this mission,
and another 5-million-dollar mission,
and 10-million-dollar mission… would you stop?
You lost your brother and sister,
your family…
lost everything
because you were fucking greedy, you shit.
Keep on being greedy, keep losing.
Why do they wanna kill us?
They successfully gave us the fake money and blamed us.
They probably wanted us to keep silent.
How silent? We don't have any evidence to expose them.
Thien Ngoc Kim Khanh cosmetic company,
its sales primarily comes from new agencies who buy products for hoarding,
not for resale.
They had no new agencies post COVID.
Ms. Khanh is the operator on top,
she was supposed to take all the money and flee.
Why doesn't she do it now?
Because that's her final catch.
Everyone has their own wishes In their lives
Whenever they feel sad
Or hard done by
Sometimes we want to share Our memories
Please always keep this friendship In mind
Two, three…
-Call my name… -Stop!
Turn off your ringtone, Uncle Nam.
Get back to work.
Ouch, it hurts.
Why did you play that?
I thought it was fun.
"Her final catch", what do you mean?
$2.5 million is not really her objective.
She wants to steal more money through this event.
What is Ms. Khanh's objective?
-Money. -A large amount of money.
Exactly, there's a huge amount of money behind this event.
She has to transfer that money to an account for covering the costs.
This laptop has a private satelite connection.
-Take a look. -Malay.
You can hack it, can’t you?
Why am I here if I can hack everything?
Then we steal it.
Are you dumb? You wanna do it the hard way while you can't even steadily walk.
You're the weakest one here.
Give me a car and I will show you who I am.
Okay, I invite you to the highway for a race.
Stop!
-Showy! -Focus on the mission.
When we have that laptop in hand,
we'll still require her fingerprint to get the money.
The index finger, right hand.
Then we cut off her index finger.
I would gladly return her a stab.
There are ten bodyguards.
We are four, defying the odds.
We all four can barely defeat one of them.
Wow!
Fighting is later, first we must figure out how to go pass a security check
and disable those security cameras.
Wonderful.
It's getting complicated.
And you two already had a plan, right?
Nope.
-Are you okay? -The prizes are iPhone, supercars…
-Welcome to the event. -Thank you.
What? Hey, where is my ticket?
-What? -Welcome.
Please step aside.
Send some guys to Zone 1 for support.
Oh, boy, where are the fish sauce and seasoning?
How can I cook without them?
Hey! Call the supplier.
Oh, boy.
May I know who will receive this stuff?
Okay, good luck.
Have a good day.
Wonderful.
Wish you all the best, everyone.
Outstanding.
You would receive a lot of money after this event.
Yes, for sure.
Ladies and gentlemen, and now is the greatest moment in this event tonight.
We proudly present and welcome to the stage the respectful captain who
has been steering our Thien Ngoc Kim Khanh boat
into these remakable successes.
Let's have a big round of applause for president Nguyen Kim Khanh.
Good evening, everyone.
Has anyone made a packet this year?
Now I will reveal the three lucky owners
of the three super cars parked in front of you.
These are the three agencies who had the highest sales last year.
Please welcome Ms. Vu Nguyen Hoang Oanh.
Ms. Tran Thi Thuy Van.
Mr. Do Thanh Chung.
Here you go.
What is it? I didn't order it.
Yes, you did.
Let's have a big round of applause…
…please return to your seats.
Now please listen to the treasured speech of Ms. Kim Khanh.
And let's see what are new opportunities for all the agencies coming up.
Please.
Dear valued agencies,
today I have good news
and bad news that I want to share with you.
Last year was quite a difficult year for us all.
However, our company still had stable earnings.
The good news is that all the economic experts agreed that,
based on the current impetus of economic recovery,
next year would be a golden year for the whole market and Thien Ngoc Kim Khanh.
And I have set a goal for us. It's 600%.
Then what does it mean?
It means it will be a sixfold increase in return on investment
applied to all the investors.
The bad news is, however,
that Thien Ngoc Kim Khanh won't receive any new investments this year.
Everyone calm down.
Do you know why are you standing here right now?
Because you're all the creators,
the first creators along with me,
helping me build this successful Thien Ngoc Kim Khanh empire.
This also means all of you deserve a gift from the company.
Right?
Now we all have two hours in total,
only two hours for your investments.
After this time,
all investments will be rejected.
This means Thien Ngoc Kim Khanh
won't receive any investments, even a penny.
Ms. Khanh! Can I use this award to re-invest into the company?
Then you will receive six supercars next year.
Now, we have one hour and 59 minutes left for the investment.
I don't care about the interest.
I'll take it all!
Just mortgage our house. Trust me!
Sell that lot and give me the money. I will buy six lots for you later.
Can I use this pension to invest?
Yes, you can.
Madam. We've got a problem.
The restroom's door is locked, come here and help me unlock it.
Sis. Hao has been locked away in Area A.
You two go help Hao, the rest come with me to the security room.
-Quick! -Yes.
Where is Mrs. Khanh?
She went to the security room.
Fuck, they set us up.
The suitcase requires a passcode to open.
How many numbers?
-Three. -Try 0-0-0.
Incorrect.
Try from 0-0-0 to 9-9-9.
Are you mad? It'll take me years to do that.
All right, I have an idea. Try using numerology.
What is numerology?
Every letter in Khanh's name corresponds to a number.
The sum of those numbers
will give you numbers corresponding to her full name.
Can you speak English please?
Never mind, let me calculate it for you.
Nguyen. Five plus seven plus three plus seven plus five plus five equals 32.
Three plus two equals 5.
Kim. Two plus nine plus four equals 15. One plus five equals six.
Khanh. Two plus eight plus one plus five plus eight equals 24.
Two plus four equals six.
-5-6-6, right? -Right.
Correct.
Damn it, we're fucked.
Well, are you looking for this?
You better stop these ridiculous things now.
Otherwise, I'll kill him.
What should we do now?
Activate the exit door. Bring him.
So this is your exit door?
I just need to stay here and relax for ten days,
after that I will be in a non-extradition country.
You're smart.
You want to clear all traces.
Smart? You know I'm smart, but you still came back to thwart me?
Listen up, boy.
If you were smarter than me, I should be the revenger,
not you.
You think you got the upper hand on us?
Hurry up.
Khoa. Hurry up.
The laptop processes this, not me.
She definitely won’t stay away from the laptop, this plan is just the first step.
The second step is…
To push her into activating the exit door.
Exactly.
The exit door is the most important step in deceit,
but it's also vulnerable.
Let's say we did it,
how do we deal with those bodyguards?
We cannot defeat them,
but we can pin them down for a few minutes.
Where is Mrs. Khanh?
She went to the security room.
I'm exhausted.
It's almost done. Keep trying.
Stop!
Or I'll kill him!
Jump! Don’t worry about me!
I'm gonna count to three.
One.
Two.
Are you insane?
Fuck you!
You're fucking useless.
Right? The money was in your hand, but you threw it away.
And you still want to fuck with me?
We're not merciless like you.
Take the money and run.
Don't you think karma will pay you back for your misdeeds someday?
Huh?
Karma?
My goodness, a scammer is speaking about ethics.
Do you know how much time and effort I put into this company?
You two and those agencies in that event are the same.
You wanted to get my money.
You were deceived because of your greed. Am I right?
Whatever I do, I do it big.
I get everything.
Then I will disappear, traceless.
I'm on a different level.
You're just immature foxes.
Speaking of karma.
We've arrived at the port.
-Get rid of them. -Yes.
Definitely karma.
But for you or for us, we don’t know yet.
You have been stunned twice by failure, haven’t you? Huh?
Let me tell you,
out there…
So don't even think you'll get away, even you have wings.
I think there will be more than 20 men.
What do you mean by that?
Let's see.
I racked my brain trying to overcome you.
We're not as experienced as you.
We're not as smart as you.
But we realized one thing,
that we're not as greedy as you.
You wouldn't even think that we don’t need this money. Right?
You two and those agencies in that event are the same.
You wanted my money so you were tricked.
How can I deceive you if you’re not greedy?
You intended to set me up in the first place.
Goddammit! Take off my hand!
Save your strength.
Use it to explain everything to them.
Everybody.
All your money is here.
Contact Ms. Khanh if you wanna get your money back.
-Give my money back… -Give my money back…
Careful!
Hey. Why don't you go down there?
Still regret that money?
This time we did it for nothing.
I don’t mind it, why do you have to mind?
To me, victory is more important than money in this case.
-You got it, greedy boy? -Hey.
I'm not greedy anymore.
-Keep greedy. -Keep losing.
Khoa.
Tu.
What is it?
Hey, old man. Old man.
I told you, that goddamn old fox
stabbed me once
then she had no choice but to get a stab in return.
Uncle Nam, we love you!
-Good job! -Cheers.
Cheers!
Hey, I'd like to take this time to recall my past, is it okay?
No, no.
Calm down!
-Calm down! -Let me tell it! Eighteen years ago…
We've been here for nearly a month, but have not came up with any ideas yet.
Right.
We need more time to look into this.
How about this?
We will ask them for one month more when they come.
It would give us more time for research.
That's right.
We must create a world class unique event.
Once in a thousand years.
Waves.
It was with winds that waves began
But where did they begin, the winds?
Neither do I remember now
When did it all begin, our love?
I got an idea.
Nope, my turn.
I'm gonna put a pump here.
And another one here, a high-power one.
We will make negative artificial waves along the coconut trees!
…2,000 Watt… go direct to the core system…
Let me put a pump here and there!
Khoa!
Khoa!
You’re such a dog, why don't you…
Hey. You talk to your VIP guest like that?
You want a kick?
-What's up? -I'm good.
Good morning, sir.
Who is he?
-Hello, ma'am. -Yeah.
He's my friend, together we have…
Ah, we together have shared joys and sorrows in many things.
-Have you? How kind of you. -Yes.
Ah, it's only something small, but I hope you like it.
Oh no, you shouldn’t have! Just come by.
You're welcome, please take it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
You two keep talking, I have to prepare lunch.
-Yes. -Go inside, sweetie.
Yes.
Go.
My family is poor, there is no one for you to deceive.
Are you out of your mind?
You want to stay here, then gifts for me.
No worries, I already prepared it.
Give it back.
-Give what? -My wallet.
-What wallet? -You little shit.
Are you still interested in this pilferage?
Are you mad?
My mom is here, how can I pickpocket you in front of her?
So what? Where is my wallet?
Who knows?
Are you crazy? I put my wallet in this pocket.
Finland and the Soviet Union have signed the Moscow Armistice,
which decrees that Finland must disarm the Nazis and drive them out of Lapland.
The Nazis adopt a scorched-earth tactic
and destroy all roads, bridges, villages, and towns in their path.
Deep in the wilderness of Lapland, there is a man who has decided
Deep in the wilderness of Lapland, there is a man who has decided to leave the war behind him.
For good.
Yeah!
He's riding to his death anyway.
Get off the horse!
Where you think you're going, old man? There's nothing down there.
We made sure of that.
What do you got there?
This old fucker is a gold miner.
You got gold in those bags?
-[laughs] -Take a look at this!
-We're rich, boys! -[whines]
-[soldier 1] You're dead! -[soldier 2 laughs]
Get down on your knees.
[soldier 1] These bags are full of gold!
Get down on your knees, grandpa!
[soldier 1] Shoot the fucker!
-[chuckles] -[soldier 2] Fuck him up!
[soldier 2] Thanks for the gold!
We've got gold!
Thank you, old fuck--
Wait.
Now.
Fire!
Cease fire!
You...
and you.
On the sides of the road now!
How many mines did we bury here?
All of them.
Pick two of our female friends and bring them to me.
And some rope.
You...
and you.
Pick me.
[Wolf] Thank you, general.
I will pass on the information.
Over and out.
The general, he has given us orders.
Turn back and head to Norway from Finland immediately.
Did you tell him he just killed seven of our men?
I did.
And?
He thinks we were lucky.
Fucking lucky.
The dog tags belong to a man named Aatami Korpi.
He was a Finnish commando.
The most feared in his unit.
The general said, and I quote:
"He's one mean motherfucker that you do not want to mess with."
He fought in the Winter War.
Lost his home and his family to the Russians.
He became a ruthless, vengeful soldier who took orders from no one.
The Finns, they gave up trying to discipline or control him.
They'd just send him out, alone, into the wilderness,
to hunt Russian patrols.
He became a one-man death squad.
[Wolf] The reports are unconfirmed,
but it looks like he has over 300 Russian kills.
The Russians...
they gave him a name.
They call him Koschei...
the Immortal.
Immortal.
The road is clear, sir.
We are going to follow our orders, right?
We are turning back?
No.
We are not turning back.
We are losing the war. We are.
In a few months, this all will be over for us.
When we get back, they will...
hang us all.
That gold is our way out.
[soldier 1] Eyes open!
Check the sides.
[soldier 2] Nothing here.
[soldier 2] Don't wait. Let's keep moving.
Don't fall behind!
Hey, hey. Hey.
Gasoline!
[soldier 1] The dogs lost the scent!
[Bruno] What's happening?
-[dogs bark, then whining] -[soldier 1] There's gasoline on the road.
[Bruno] They are useless.
[Bruno] Calm down, boy.
[soldier 1] Hey!
Release the dog.
-[soldier 1] Release the dog! -[soldier 2] Go on, boy!
Finish him.
[Bruno] Immortal or not, a man needs air.
[Bruno] Now, get me the gold.
Go after him! Now!
One more meter and I'll have you shot!
Desertion is punishable by death.
Fuck this.
Come on, here. [shushing]
Find me a boat.
Any last words?
I didn't think so.
For your troubles.
[Bruno] Put the hat back on.
This son of a bitch is still alive.
Shoot the man. Shoot the dog too.
And the dog!
Shoot the fucking dog!
Müller?
Müller?
The plane is ready.
What about the rest of our squad?
They don't need us to get to Norway.
The boys have a crateful of booze and a truck full of bitches.
I'm sure they'll figure something out.
I would.
[soldier 1] The road is blocked. Come and take a look at this.
[soldier 2] What's going on?
[soldier 1] There's something in the road.
Is this the plane?
No, idiot.
This is something else.
The pilot has been hanged.
-That's my rope. -What?
That's the rope I used to hang Korpi with.
[soldier 1] Can you see anything?
Let's get the fuck out of here.
[soldier 1] What's happening?
I recognize it, I swear.
-[soldier 2] What's the order? -Everybody move!
[soldier 3] Start the engines.
[soldier 1] Come on, let's go.
[soldier 1] Let's go, go!
Well?
He's back.
He's hanging from a rope somewhere. He's dead.
-What's so fucking funny? -Nothing.
What the fuck are you smiling for, then?
Do you assholes really think you have succeeded
where hundreds of Russians have died trying?
We all know the story.
You'll see what happens when you take everything from him.
He won't give up.
He'll just keep coming back.
Do you really believe that he's immortal?
No.
He just refuses to die.
We have a word for that in Finland, but it's impossible to translate.
You see, this is not about who's the strongest.
This is about not giving up.
And he won't.
Ever.
No matter what you bitches are trying.
You only will make him stronger.
So...
what is so fucking funny...
is that you...
your boyfriend...
and everything that is left of your sorry-ass company...
are already dead.
What?
Was that one of ours?
Was that Jens?
We almost ran into the bitches.
Can somebody tell me what the fuck is going on?
Nothing. It's all good, sir.
Sir, they're all dead.
We are almost there. Step on it!
Wolf...
go out there and kill him.
One, two...
three!
Keep going!
Keep going.
Please, please.
That's him. That's Koschei.
[Bruno] Do you see him?
Yep. He's still down there.
It's bad. It's bad, I need--
If you're not dead, you fly this fucking plane!
Did you hear that?
It's nothing. Just an old plane.
We might have a problem.
Die, fucker!
Why won't you die?
Fuck you!
[in Finnish] To your positions.
[in Finnish] Hello.
Where did you get that tank?
From the Nazis.
Where are the Nazis?
Except this asshole, they're all in hell.
Hell?
Were there others?
Everyone else is dead.
[in Finnish] Bills.
