family is everything.
[narrator] It's the bonds within the pride,
the pack,
and the herd…
…that allow each member to succeed.
[narrator] Nowhere are these bonds tested more fiercely
than in the great Kalahari Desert.
Here families are shaped
by courageous mothers…
wise elders…
…and tenacious underdogs.
[narrator] All drawn to the immense oasis that lies at the desert's very heart.
[narrator] The Okavango Delta.
Home to more wildlife than any other wetland on Earth…
it is seeing some of the most extreme seasonal change on the planet.
[narrator] Through the chaos and hardship of the coming year…
fates will entwine,
and incredible relationships will be forged.
Not just within families but between families.
And even with the land itself.
[narrator] For a two-year-old lioness,
the strength of family comes from her pride.
She and her sisterhood control this territory…
…and their lead male reigns as warrior king.
But in the Delta, change can come suddenly
and upend a family's peaceful existence.
[narrator] The chink in her pride's armor is the king himself.
Years of fighting to defend his family and territory
have taken their toll.
His weakness puts the lioness at risk.
[narrator] And presents an opportunity
for two ambitious young males.
[narrator] The old warrior marks his territory.
[narrator] But he's frail.
And outnumbered.
Every year in the Okavango is a new and dangerous journey,
but for the lioness,
this year will be the most uncertain she's ever faced.
[narrator] Every family confronts the challenges of the Delta
in its own way.
[narrator] A pack of painted wolves, 24 strong.
Their strength, a testament to their great leader,
the alpha female.
[narrator] She's trained them to think and hunt as one.
And to provide for all.
But the alpha is pregnant.
Her team will lose their leader,
just as the Delta faces its greatest upheaval.
[narrator] It's May.
And the surrounding Kalahari Desert is facing the worst drought in decades.
Thousands of animals are fleeing the parched outer regions…
traveling for weeks.
All drawn here for one reason.
[narrator] Water.
Rainwater that fell four months ago
in the Angolan Highlands to the north
has finally made its way down,
across the Kalahari and into the flatlands of the Delta.
[narrator] Over nine trillion liters of fresh water
floods the vast desert…
creating
the greatest oasis on the planet.
[narrator] In the flood's wake come the great herds…
joining those who live here year-round.
Everyone has a role to play
in shaping and maintaining this land.
[narrator] Even a six-month-old elephant
on her first visit.
She's never seen so much water…
…and food.
[narrator] With endless floodplains to munch their way through,
elephants become the natural gardeners of the Delta…
uprooting far more than they can eat.
But over-pruning can clog the waterways,
halting the water's spread.
What the gardeners have blocked up,
families of hippos bulldoze through.
Not being swimmers, they tiptoe along the bottom.
And in their wake, leave hippo-sized highways…
that connect rivers to pools and pools to floodplains…
allowing the water to keep flowing,
feeding the vibrant growth of the entire Delta.
[narrator] But the flood isn't good news for all.
For the lioness,
it means a loss of hunting grounds.
And the old warrior king is nowhere to be seen.
[narrator] Whether he fled or was killed,
the young invaders have usurped his throne.
[narrator] Only lionesses of breeding age are allowed to stay now.
[narrator] And she's not one of them.
To these new males, she's just an extra mouth to feed,
with little to contribute.
[narrator] Banished and alone,
she'll need all her skill just to stay alive.
[narrator] The alpha female has been housebound for weeks.
Because… Well, who would leave this scruffy bunch?
[narrator] At four weeks old, her pups venture out for the first time.
[narrator] All 14 of them.
Unable to hunt for herself, she must rely on her pack
to bring the meat she needs to keep her milk flowing.
[narrator] But her stay-at-home work is nonstop.
Sweeping out the den…
three weeks' worth of ticks and fleas…
landing right back where they started.
[narrator] Her pack is on patrol…
without their leader.
And the floodwaters are slowing them down.
[narrator] Lechwe.
Just one would feed the entire pack.
[narrator] With splayed hooves and powerful legs,
they can drive on through the flood.
Without the guidance of the alpha,
the pack follow them into the deeper water.
It's futile.
[narrator] And then…
a lone impala.
He lacks the paddle-like hooves and long legs of the lechwe.
[narrator] They finish the job quickly to avoid a clash with competitors.
[narrator] The pack often take out the weak or injured in a group,
easier prey,
with the added benefit of reducing disease in herds.
[narrator] The hunters deliver their meals in the safest way possible.
In their stomachs.
Until the pups can hunt themselves,
they eat first.
Generosity is a core principle of their pack.
Though learning to share doesn't come easily.
Retiring to the den with your very first piece of meat
is about as good as it gets.
[narrator] With water levels at their highest,
the Okavango becomes a true paradise.
Aquatic life from the surrounding rivers and swamps
spreads into the grassland to spawn.
Branches and trees knocked down by elephants
create protected nurseries for young fish.
[narrator] During peak flood,
the Delta swells to twice its original size,
and anywhere high and dry becomes prime real estate.
Water fig trees provide perfect nesting
for an astonishing variety of fish-eating birds.
[narrator] For these families, it's not so much about where you build.
It's what you build.
[narrator] Only the finest construction materials will do.
[narrator] If you can't find the exact fabric you're looking for…
just steal it from your neighbor.
They can always steal it back again.
[narrator] Finally,
a nest ready to hold their most treasured possessions.
Gently turned…
and shaded from the scalding sun.
[narrator] Eggshell? Snail shell?
He's a first-time dad.
Everyone is in a race to raise their young
before the floodwaters recede…
and the nests lose their island protection.
[narrator] The lioness has been struggling to make a kill.
[narrator] In drier conditions, a reedbuck or lechwe would be a good bet.
[narrator] But not in the flood, not by herself.
And she's got competition.
Time to push back on her rivals.
[narrator] It's pure intimidation. She won't eat the carcass.
The pack would be wise not to test her patience again.
[narrator] By September, the temperatures rise,
and water levels begin to drop,
leaving shrinking pools crowded with fish.
Perfect timing.
[narrator] The adults get to work…
feeding their precious little monsters.
[narrator] New pools form each day as the flood recedes.
[narrator] Everyone has their own special technique
to go with their own special bill.
Pelicans favor the fishing net.
[narrator] Pied kingfishers…
use the dive-bombing system.
[narrator] Openbill storks have snail-plucking down to a science.
And the rather theatrical black egret
uses its cape to mimic shady spots where fish like to hide.
Bravo.
Different approaches with one purpose.
[narrator] To build up their chicks' strength as quickly as possible.
[narrator] Pelican chicks are the greediest.
They need up to 30 feeds a day.
The tireless adults all know
the golden rule of family life in the Delta.
The stronger your young, the greater their chances of survival.
[narrator] As the floodwaters recede
and the desert heat builds,
hunting grounds dry out…
…shifting the balance of power back to the predators.
But alone, the lioness' kill rate is still dangerously low.
[narrator] She's growing weaker by the day.
To complicate matters,
she's come into season.
Her scent will carry to any lions in the area.
Including those she most wants to avoid.
[narrator] The young males who destroyed her family.
[narrator] But with the hunting grounds opening up,
another even bigger male is drawn to the area.
[narrator] His dark mane and deep call
are signs he's in his prime.
[narrator] It's risky.
But if they join forces,
he could offer protection and hunting support.
[narrator] Her newfound alliance is short-lived.
The stranger moves on after only a few days.
Alone, once more,
but this time pregnant.
She won't be hunting for just herself anymore.
[narrator] Every family in the Delta
is intimately connected to the rhythms of the changing seasons.
The water levels are plummeting,
turning to mud.
Fun for a calf…
…but it's a sign her herd should move on.
[narrator] With the dry season taking grip,
the herds need to make the most of whatever grazing is left.
She learns from watching.
But some things, she has yet to perfect.
[narrator] Such as paying attention, so as not to get left behind.
She's being taken to a special place.
A stand of fan palms.
They thrive where salts have been left behind by the evaporating flood.
And the fruits that sit at the top
are revered by elephants.
Harvesting such lofty treats
is a trick that only a four-ton bull can pull off.
Each shake releases hundreds of fruits at once.
[narrator] He knocks down enough for everyone.
[narrator] This precious meal
is not just for this family and not just for today.
Elephants are the chief distributors
of fan palm seeds.
-The calf's ancestors left this fruit. -[whines]
[narrator] And now she will do the same for those to come.
The herd will carry the seeds for many miles.
Wherever they release them in their dung, they can take root.
Just another of the herd's vital contributions to the Delta.
[narrator] It will be their last decent meal.
From here on, the increasing scarcity of food and water will drive their every move.
the increasing scarcity of food and water will drive their every move.
[narrator] The painted wolves have made it through the flood,
but not entirely intact.
One team member already killed,
and now the best hunters have deserted the alpha and her pups.
[narrator] Too many new mouths to feed
and not enough food to go around.
It's time for the rookies to move out of the den
and begin searching for food.
[narrator] The pups' first great adventure.
Their first patrol with the grown-ups.
Though, they are more of a hindrance than a help.
Their little legs will carry them up to 15 kilometers a day.
The alpha must rebuild her team into a peak hunting machine…
and teach her pups the ways of the pack hunter.
[narrator] The receding floodwaters
have created perfect conditions to unleash a plague.
[narrator] Locusts.
The building heat triggers a mass hatching.
Ten million greedy mouths devour the drying vegetation.
Ancient termite mounds seem to be the only things impervious
to the great forces now at play in the Delta.
It's October.
In two short months,
the drought has transformed a verdant paradise
into a barren dust bowl.
All the herds are searching for water
wherever they can find it.
[narrator] They are easy pickings for the two young males.
Who grow bigger and stronger every day.
[narrator] They follow the buffaloes' every move.
Tracking the same herds,
the lioness must stay a safe distance from the males.
[narrator] In her delicate state, she desperately needs to eat.
[narrator] But taking on prey the size of a buffalo all by herself
[narrator] But taking on prey the size of a buffalo all by herself is next to impossible.
[narrator] At best, she can pick up scraps left by the males,
scavenging the bare minimum she needs to stay alive.
[narrator] All the herds and their predators are being drawn in by the drought,
coming together in the heart of the Delta,
where the last water sources remain.
[narrator] The calf and her herd
have to travel further with each passing day.
[narrator] Their eyesight may be poor, but with highly attuned hearing and smell,
elephants can sense danger from miles away.
[narrator] Nile crocodiles.
Some up to six meters long, weighing three-quarters of a ton.
But most are pretty small, only a meter or so.
[narrator] The older elephants show the calf how to get to the water
by navigating this strange obstacle course.
[narrator] At last.
And if you still haven't mastered the art of the trunk,
face drinking is always a good fallback.
[narrator] The calf is learning…
the hard way.
This water hole is the herd's savior.
Elephants also use it to protect their skin from the sun.
[narrator] The mud cools their overheated bodies as it evaporates.
And the dust settles in the cracks and crevices of their skin,
acting as sunblock.
A spot like this is highly sought-after.
[narrator] But the herd aren't ready to move on from their mud spa just yet.
[narrator] Such difficult times teach the growing pups many things.
Harassing a well-fed vulture must be a good lesson in… something.
[narrator] A lone hyena…
makes for a more serious education.
Testing their stress levels helps prepare them
for future confrontations with competitors.
[narrator] But they still need to learn the most important lesson.
[narrator] The art…
of the hunt.
[narrator] With the alpha now back in charge…
she directs the team to drive their prey into the thick mud
to slow them down.
[narrator] Her coaching is paying off.
They're learning who to target…
and who to leave.
[narrator] The pack is growing wiser and closer each day.
[narrator] By late October, temperatures have soared to 45 degrees Celsius.
[narrator] Not a drop has fallen.
In recent years, the dry seasons here have been getting longer,
the heat more severe.
[narrator] This year is fast becoming the drought of the century.
Every day becomes a gamble
to find enough water to keep the whole herd alive.
[narrator] The calf and her mother need it the most.
She's a prisoner in these lands
that only a few months ago offered her so much.
[narrator] Her survival is entirely in the hands
of the wise, old leader.
The herd's matriarch.
She's been traveling these pathways
since she, too, was a young calf.
Her brain, infused with memories,
holds an ancient internal map
of where the last pockets of water might be found.
[narrator] Family is more than just the herd.
Family is memory…
and that's what's making the difference
between life and death.
[narrator] The old family knowledge leads them to one of the last remaining water holes
in the entire Delta.
[narrator] Every muddy drop is a lifesaver.
But their little one can't get to the water.
[narrator] So she simply gets into the water.
Getting out, not so easy.
[narrator] For a clumsy calf, a loving family is her most powerful ally.
[narrator] There's no time to waste.
They need more water,
and they'll chase the storm front to find it.
-Finally, clouds begin to form. -[thunder rumbling]
Giant storm cells.
[narrator] Elephants are able to hear the low frequencies of distant thunder
and detect storms up to 200 kilometers away.
[narrator] But in a region that's gone seven months with barely a drop of rain,
the tinder-dry grasses are a ticking bomb.
The adults in the herd have seen fire before.
Each year, up to 4,000 square kilometers of the Delta burns.
They know to stick close together as they try to navigate the flames.
The fires are devastating…
…but don't devour everything.
[narrator] The grazers have thinned the amount of fuel available to burn.
And the scorched areas will create new pathways
for next year's flood to access.
The Delta has always found a way to heal
because its residents never stop playing their part.
[narrator] At last, the skies yield.
The greatest drought in living memory
is finally broken.
[narrator] Over the next five months,
half a meter of rain will fall here.
Any ground scorched by the fire
will be revitalized.
[narrator] The herds are released from their water holes.
-And the predators spread out. -[growls]
[narrator] Keeping the grazers on the move,
giving the new shoots a chance,
and preventing any one area from becoming depleted.
[narrator] Balance…
is maintained.
[narrator] And with the arrival of the rains…
come four new cubs.
[narrator] The flush of green has prompted a baby boom.
[narrator] She moves her cubs every few days…
to prevent their scent from attracting enemies.
[narrator] But her latest move hasn't gone unnoticed.
[narrator] The young males have picked up their trail.
They will not tolerate the presence of another male's cubs.
[narrator] She's half their size and outnumbered.
[narrator] They're trapped.
[narrator] Her instinct is to lead her babies to safety.
[narrator] But the cubs have no idea who they're up against.
[narrator] She's lost track of a cub.
[narrator] She'll fight to the death for her family…
…but the males won't risk further injury.
[narrator] Thanks to their mother's bravery, three of her cubs have survived.
[narrator] She can't rest for long.
She's all they've got.
[narrator] For the painted wolves, life again is sweet.
Their mother has risen
to the greatest challenge she's ever faced.
Bringing a pack cut to half its size
through the perils of the drought
and transforming a hapless bunch of rookies
into a hardworking, successful team.
[narrator] Their comeback is complete.
[narrator] The gutsy little calf has chalked up her first year in the Delta…
and she herself has contributed to its upkeep…
with every reed she's trampled,
every palm seed she's left.
If she can survive another 30 or 40 more years
of increasing extremes,
fires, floods, and famines…
…she will finally become a matriarch
and pass on everything she's learned
to the next generation.
[narrator] Now, four months old,
the lioness's cubs are getting stronger
and more able every day.
Single-handedly, she's kept them all well-fed.
[narrator] Their games are practice for real life.
To teach them how to catch prey like their mother.
[narrator] She once lost what was most precious to her.
But now, has a little pride to call her own.
[narrator] Her cubs will soon learn the vital importance of family.
Just one of a myriad of families whose presence sustains their land.
[narrator] These animals will continue to adapt
as best they can…
to the growing threats they face.
The world's climate changing…
becoming increasingly hostile, more extreme.
Their greatest weapon in their fight to survive is each other.
For their fates are bound together with this great wilderness.
The magnificent,
Incoming call from Mom Irene.
-Hi, Mom. -Hi, sweetheart. Have you arrived?
Not yet. We're picking up Cami at the airport, then we're going home.
Are you okay?
Please, don't drive too fast.
Mom, we're on a hydrofoil.
Right, sorry, I thought you were driving.
What about you? I'm fine. Why are you worried about me now?
You're with a man. The last time was ten years ago.
We went on holiday together last year as well, you know?
Actually, you and I were together last year, and then you met him.
Whatever. Say hi to Camilla and the others.
-Be careful. Call me. -Okay.
-Bye. -Bye Mom.
Your son is quite right.
This holiday is actually a test for us, don't you think?
The truth is, this is Vincenzo's first trip without me.
But more importantly, it's your first trip without him.
How about some scialatielli all'Amalfitana instead of going to Sicily?
Look, I'm not doing it for you.
You know, I never liked planned holidays.
I can't believe this.
Fat man with a stroller.
Nuns. A good-looking ginger girl.
-Where? -It's not her, Vinz.
Keep calm, you're all too excited.
It's tactically wrong to show this much enthusiasm.
Who cares about tactics? Did you get why I wanted to ask her to come live with me?
You stupid?
Living together kills any relationship. Everyone says that.
Because nobody has ever met a girl like Camilla.
What do you know about living together?
Nothing. This holiday will actually be a test.
-A test. -A test.
-Cami! Hi! -Baby! Hi!
-I missed you a lot. -I missed you too.
Hi.
-She's Nathalie. Vincenzo. -Hi.
-Hi. -Vincenzo.
There's the possessive.
I speak Italian as well. I'm studying it at university.
-Hi. -So you speak it better than me.
It's so nice to meet you anyway,
because it's so nice to meet new people of other sexes in summer,
-girls as well. -Bye.
Maybe English would have been better.
Something clicked already, anyway.
-I'll reach her, and… -Really?
-I missed you. -I missed you too.
I wasn't joking.
I'm serious, I'll show you.
Thank you, have a nice day.
-Bye. -Thank you.
We're almost there, okay?
-At last. -We're eating now, right?
We climbed 800 steps…
Here we are.
Guys, look how wonderful it is.
Oh, God.
Look at the view!
Wow, not bad, Vincenzino.
I can't believe it. It's wonderful.
Vinz, can you ask your father if he wants to adopt me? Or give me a sponsorship?
Come and see inside.
Come on in, guys. This is the living room.
Here's the dining room. Bathroom is down there on the right.
Bedrooms are over there.
-And who's in the painting? -That one?
-Yes. -That's my father.
You have the same nose.
Oh, there should also be a cabinet with two shelves
-with a golden crab on top. -I see.
Please don't touch it. It's my father's. It's worth a lot of money.
-Got it? -Yes.
-You touched it, didn't you? -No.
Cami and I are sleeping there.
Furio, you and Nathalie will sleep here. There are two single beds.
Do I have to sleep with him?
You said that with both excitement and terror.
If you look at me while I shower, or while I get undressed…
-It was just terror, then. -This will be a great holiday.
Come, I'll show you the town.
It's wonderful here.
This is nothing.
-Thanks. -Salvato.
-Hey, Vince. Is that you? -Hey.
This is Camilla.
Hi, Camilla, nice to meet you.
-Good-looking, but above all, lucky. -Good man.
-Above all, lucky, of course. -Right.
-Thank you. -Bye.
-Vincenzo, it's been a lot. Welcome. -Thank you.
-Hey Vince! -They even have Buffalo mozzarella.
Hi.
-And who is this pretty girl? -She's my girlfriend.
You introduce her and you don't tell me first?
You're so beautiful.
-My pleasure. -Hi, pleasure is all mine.
Gennaro, come here, Vincenzo is here.
-How are you? -Everything is fine. You?
-Everything's all right. -Bye, Gennaro.
-They're so nice. -They are.
Come, I'll show you a special place.
-This one is beautiful. -Let me feel it.
-Holy cow, it's beautiful. -Isn't it?
The fabric is so light.
Okay, I'll take it.
-I think I'll wear it tonight. -Good idea.
I can't believe there isn't a free room in all Amalfi.
Enough. If we can't find a room, I'll sleep here.
Well, I think I know somewhere more comfortable than these steps.
Where?
I can't.
-Can you sleep? -Yes.
I was almost there, actually.
At least we have a five-star view.
The first time I slept in a car,
it must have been in the '90s, after a concert.
I remember the first time I slept in a car too.
In Corsica, in a 2CV.
No reclining seats.
But my girlfriend was a happy camper.
So you weren't alone? There was a girl with you.
-Retroactive jealousy? -No.
-What was she called? -Paola.
You remember. Come on, I was 20, as was Vincenzo.
Come on, I was 20, as was Vincenzo.
No, not Vincenzo. Don't touch this spot now, please.
You in your 2CV with that Paola,
him with Camilla in the bed where he was conceived.
My God, I'm never going to be able to sleep now.
That's some information I would have preferred not to receive.
-Goodnight. -Retroactive jealousy?
This?
This is a whistle. My grandpa had it. He knows about it already.
My grandpa had it the day he met my grandma.
Then he gave it to my dad, and he met Mom.
Stuck in here is the saliva of three generations of lifeguards.
Do you want to blow it?
Hey Vinz, there is a super creepy guy who keeps staring at me.
Where?
He's coming towards us now.
Vinz! How are you?
Hey! I'm good, how are you?
-Good. -Guys, meet Hans.
He's the brother I never had.
I'm the brother who is being adopted soon.
-Nice to meet you. -You too.
We spent every summer here together since we were kids.
Camilla, my girlfriend.
-Nice to meet you. -Likewise.
Nathalie.
-Nathalie. -Hans.
Fancy a drink?
-Yes. -Let's go.
Make some noise! Are you sure?
We've been preparing for weeks. You remember the score, right?
Yeah, of course. But now focus. We're gonna rock!
-What is he doing? -Vinz.
-I'll wait in the crowd. -Where are you going?
-They're fighting for the mike. -I can't sing.
A round of applause for?
Vincenzo.
Go!
The song that I am about to sing, I know the lyrics by heart.
It's a song I've been listening to all this year,
while my girlfriend was in Canada.
Camilla, I'm happy that you're back.
Me neither, believe me.
-That's Camilla, anyway. It's her. -Stop it.
Please, stop.
Your every thought, your every move
Your every silence More and more every day
I find in everything you do I see in everything you are
The girl that I've always been dreaming of
And all the world around is more colorful
There is not one struggle when you're here
It's original.
You are perfection, thank God you're here
I open my arms to the sky and think
You're the most beautiful in the world
You're the most beautiful for me
-Thank you. -Bravo, Vinz.
That was for Camilla. Cami, I love you.
-Thanks, everyone. -Go, Vinz!
What I don't understand is,
even the biggest loser can get something on social networks.
-What am I doing wrong? -Can I?
You're missing some appeal.
Appeal.
My ex used to say that too.
How long had you two been together?
We went on a date once.
So this was the longest relationship you ever had?
Maybe you didn't get it.
Here in front of you, there is someone who has never been loved.
But who has lots and lots of love to give.
To Rebecca?
No?
Everyone looks at her, but she doesn't look at anyone.
And he's Lucio, my partner.
-Hi, nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you, Lucio.
So you slept in the car?
It was late, we didn't want to bother you.
You, bother us? This is your home.
You even have your room here.
Oh, really? Ah, that room.
Oh, that's great.
It's just… Vincenzo mustn't know I'm here.
-Hans, is he okay? -Yes, he is.
He's in Cala Ventresca with Vincenzo and the others.
Cala Ventresca is nice.
-But isn't that the one with a stony road? -Yes.
But… Irene, don't worry.
Another one.
Okay, it's clear now.
That's so hard. Head down.
Get down, stay down. Okay, keep going.
When someone says some bullshit, you say "Bah…"
-Understood? -Bah…
She's a fast learner, at least.
-Cami. -Sorry, you're right.
Look, we don't need to dive.
Why don't we join them?
It's full of rocks here. There's one on the left and one on the right.
I don't know. In my opinion,
it's better if we leave it, so let's go that way.
-Is it clear down here? -It is, straight down. Why?
-Are you ready? -What?
-Go! -No!
Are you crazy? What if there was something under the water?
I want to do everything with you, baby.
Watch out!
What are you doing?
Hey, Nat! Why you are still wearing a T-shirt?
We're at the seaside, not in Canada.
It's better with a T-shirt.
No sunburn, no jellyfish stings.
-Are there jellyfish in here? -Who knows.
Damn!
I'm allergic to jellyfish.
You could have said something.
Ready?
Yes.
This place and Brigitte convinced me to stop being a rover.
That summer changed my life, it shook me up.
Wasn't it the same year we met Irene and Roberto?
Yes, that's right.
How's Vincenzo?
He's all grown up.
Do you remember when he and Hans would stick to us?
-They were even bothering. -Yes, like little chicks.
Of course, Roberto always told them that when they wouldn't go far. How was it?
No, if they would wander away, they would turn into werewolves.
You have a nice house.
You speak German.
There are a lot of things that you still don't know about me.
He said this is a nice place.
Thank you.
If you had seen it 20 years ago… It was falling apart.
If you had seen it 20 years ago… It was falling apart. Do you remember?
-We wouldn't have fixed it -Wonderful.
if it wasn't for Irene and Roberto.
Right.
Again with Roberto.
Come on, we'll be late to the party.
-You like it here? -It's wonderful.
They've put some lights up here.
-Cami, have you seen how beautiful it is? -It's beautiful.
Look, limoncello shots.
Vinz. Excuse us.
Is that the way of waking people up? You tomato head.
Don't call me tomato head. I'm older than you.
Stop, you mozzarella head.
Give me the stick, you tomato head.
Hey Hans, your restyling is working well with my profile.
See?
But what did I tell you?
What did you tell me?
No red shorts.
-Never. -Never.
REBECCA HAS ACCEPTED YOUR FRIENDSHIP REQUEST
Hans, I love you.
-What happened? -Rebecca accepted my follow.
Great.
Yes, great, but now I need a good line,
-I need to write her something… -Yes.
Yes, but do you know how many people text Rebecca in one day?
-How many? -A lot.
A lot. So how can you get on top of so many people?
I kill the others.
No.
You have to tell her something nobody has told her before.
"I would like to be the father of your kids."
Sleep on it.
-No, thank you. -Come on.
-Are you hot? -No.
-I don't need anything. -Sure?
-Do you want to take a picture? -No.
-We'll do it together. -Are you together?
-No. -You want a picture with her?
Yes. Let's do it, he will go away.
Thank you.
Smile, guys.
Look at me.
I'll print it for you, just a second.
-Here you are. -Thanks a lot.
Thank you, man. Bye. Can I see it?
"It's…"
-Do you know what these are? -Puppets.
Puppets, right.
-Give me the stick. -No!
It's beautiful to see so many girls in love.
I'm older than you.
Do you want to know the future of your love story?
No, thanks.
Come on, it's just five euros.
Well, maybe it's nice. We're in.
Well, maybe it's nice. We're in. All right.
Let's see what these cards will say.
-There you go. -Here.
Damn.
-Death. -Lucky as usual.
No, this card just means there will be a huge change.
A positive one?
This I don't know.
And you can tell us where we will be in a few months?
Sure I can.
Far away.
Very far.
I think she sees in the past, not in the future.
You like Hans?
Furio…
And you tore it. Are you happy now? Was it me?
Hey, there's nothing bad about it. He's a nice guy.
You like him.
This summer,
my boyfriend should have come too.
If you were Rebecca,
would you date…
someone like me?
I don't know.
I am not Rebecca.
But I think it's worth it to get to know you.
You see, if you try hard, sometimes you can even say something nice.
-What's that? -Don't get used to it.
You put my T-shirt on.
-Why, can't I? -Of course, you can.
-Cami. -Yes?
-I've found a job in a call center. -What?
You found a job?
-Yes. -You didn't tell me.
I wanted it to be a surprise.
I know it's not a dream job,
but at least we can afford a little house.
I already told Mom, and she already paid the deposit.
So if we want,
we can go live there starting next month.
That's nice.
We have to make up for all the time we've lost.
Why, what have I done?
But it's not normal…
It's not normal, it's summer, you can't ask to sleep with me because it's cold.
It's cold.
I feel a breeze coming from the drafts.
SUNSET
Nat, some people are born luckier than others.
You really think Rebecca will date you for the bullshit that you'll post?
No.
-Guys, have you seen Vincenzo? -No, why?
He's been gone for an hour, and he left his phone here.
Cami. Relax.
He must be taking some pictures of the view here in Amalfi.
Furio.
Do you see him?
What do we do now?
I don't know.
You know, I didn't remember how good it is to wake up with someone at your side.
If we want,
this could be our daily life.
-Always being on holiday? -No.
We could stop seeing each other only on the weekends.
Maybe without kids sleeping next door.
Vincenzo can look after himself now.
You have to think about yourself.
About us.
You want us to live together?
You see, Irene,
when I met you,
I realized that there is still one thing that can surprise me.
Everyday life.
And to think that I was so scared once.
Way more than you are now.
-Cami, hi. -Hi Irene, I know you're in Sicily
so I don't want to worry you,
but Vinz left early this morning and isn't back yet.
Sorry, I can't… Can you please explain it?
We can't find him, we… What do you mean you can't find him? Vincenzo.
What do you mean you can't find him? Vincenzo.
-I don't know what to do. -I'm coming, I'm in Amalfi.
Vinz! Vincenzo!
-Did you see him? -No.
-What do you mean, no? -What do we do now?
Let's split, okay?
Yes.
I'll go this way.
-I don't feel good. -Vinz!
Your attention please. A visually-impaired kid is missing.
His name is Vincenzo, he has brown hair
and he's wearing a white shirt and sunglasses.
Please go to the harbor if you have any information.
Vincenzo!
Vincenzo.
Vincenzo!
Vincenzo!
Nothing here as well.
Vincenzo!
Oh, sweetheart.
-Oh, my God. -What are you doing here?
-We were worried. -Where were you?
You too? Nothing happened.
Why aren't you in Sicily with Lucio?
-He's looking for you too. -Lucio too?
We were scared to death.
Why didn't you call me? You know my number.
God, I would have found the way.
It would have taken a bit longer, but I would have come home.
-Here, I brought your phone. -Right.
Here, it was supposed to be a surprise.
No, leave him.
It would just make him feel worse.
Why is he acting like that?
Why can't I be on a freaking normal holiday
without everybody worrying about me?
That's the first swear word I heard coming from you ever since I've known you.
You sure you're okay?
Furio, you too? Please, I'm fine, okay? Stop asking me.
You know how your mom is.
She wakes up in the morning, reads your horoscope,
and if it says "possible setbacks," she panics.
I know, I expect this from my mother, but not from Camilla.
I can't be with a girl that calls the police when I'm gone for ten minutes.
Hey Vi…
Did you know that the heart of a blue whale
can weigh up to 200 kilos?
What does it have to do with it?
Nothing. Just to distract you.
Can you be careful? You're scaring me. You'll cut your hands. If you had told me "Leave it to me," you would've been in the apple's place.
If you had told me "Leave it to me," you would've been in the apple's place.
I understand her.
When I met you, I needed time to understand how to deal with you.
Give her time.
Why don't you have dinner with her? We'll go out with Hans.
You don't just say bullshit after all.
Vinz, my heart is as big as that of a blue whale.
-It's 50 euros, anyway. -Take this.
-Did I get you? -You did get me.
I've been waiting for this day all my life.
The day when the ugly duckling would become a wonderful swan.
I've always known that.
I've never doubted my aesthetic potential, not for one second.
I knew that in a blink of an eye,
my body would turn into fodder for lustful women,
gourmet food for their insatiable sexual appetite.
But I feel like a moron in this, guys.
I'm glad you said that.
The cheetah style doesn't suit you well…
This one.
And take off the whistle.
-…and one day-- -No, wait…
-He got up and-- -Yes, and the wood broke,
and he got stuck there for hours, with one leg down and one up.
-The whole time? -Yes!
-What? Why? -No. Because.
-What? -Rebecca is coming
and I am sweating melon vodka.
What should I do?
-Go. -Should I go?
-Yes. -Go.
I'll pretend to be on the phone and I'll get closer.
-Will it work? -Yes.
Nat, give me your phone, I'll look richer.
-What? -Give me your phone.
-Thank you. -What about this?
I've found it in Vincenzo's father's night table.
-I will put it back. -Furio!
We'll go dancing.
-No. -Why not? Just one.
This is something somebody told you once about the candies…
Trust me. Come on. -Come on, just one dance. -Okay.
-Deal? -Deal.
Hi, excuse me, I…
It feels like we're at a restaurant, I swear.
You're too partial, it doesn't count.
Look, Vinz,
I wanted to tell you something.
I have…
Is there someone singing in the garden? I think.
Go to the next verse. Happy birthday, man!
-Happy birthday, Francesco! -Happy birthday!
Thanks. It's Vincenzo, anyway.
Vincenzo.
-What the hell? -Happy birthday, Vinz.
-Thanks. -Happy birthday.
Thank you, everyone.
-Thanks. -Happy birthday!
Play something! I brought the whole club to you.
Happy birthday, Vinz.
Thank you, everyone!
And that's done. Unbelievable.
Nat, take a slice of cake, it's good.
-I'm sorry. -Are you smiling?
So you want a war?
-You started it! -No! Okay, I give up.
-Do you give up? -Yes.
I don't have a girlfriend.
I don't have a job.
And I'm living with my parents.
I'm here, and my dreams are over there.
And in the middle, there's white-hot lava like in The Lord of the Rings.
But you don't have that ring, Vinz, because you're not Frodo.
No. No.
-No. -And I'm not Gandalf.
-Of course not. -Well, he, she--
Fu, listen to me.
We'll find that ring together, okay?
-Thanks. -You're welcome.
All right.
Guys.
Come on, wake up.
Wake up, time to go to the beach. Come on, get up.
Come on, guys.
-Let's go. -Dad.
I didn't know you were coming.
Happy birthday, Vincenzino.
Thanks.
I'll introduce you to Camilla then. Cami!
I'll introduce you to Camilla then. Cami! Yes.
Hi. It's very nice to meet you. Camilla.
She's the crazy one who chose to bear with me.
And I'm a terrible father trying to make up for it.
Roberto.
Irene. I wanted to surprise Vincenzo.
You surprised everyone, I think.
He's… Lucio, my partner.
"Partner" feels a lot like a 50-something in andropause, but it's okay.
-Nice to meet you. -Hi.
I'll go make you some coffee.
-Happy birthday, honey. -Thanks, Mom.
Lucio and I got you a present.
Really?
So, I feel they're shoes.
They're canvas shoes.
I got you a present too.
-But you left me the house already. -Open it.
-These are? -Smart glasses.
To make your life easier.
They see colors, they read boards, they're…
These are very comfortable too, good for the beach.
Yes.
Listen, why don't we go on a boat trip together?
You sure we're going the right way?
I have no idea, actually.
I am just…
-following my instinct. -Okay.
Do you want to try?
-Yes, let me try. -Okay.
-Where should I go? -Straight ahead.
-Straight ahead. No turns. -You can turn.
-A bit on the left, a bit on the right. -Randomly, right.
Watch out, a traffic light!
-Be serious. -I am.
Don't speed. Who are we chasing, Vinz?
A toast to these wonderful friends.
-Cheers! -Cheers!
Vinz, to your 20 years.
And to yours too, they're not over yet.
You won't get away with it. I want a speech.
Okay, so a toast
to all those trains you take by chance that lead you where you wouldn't expect.
-Cheers! -Cheers!
And to those where you get down at the wrong stop.
A toast to Furio as well,
because Rebecca finally decided to meet him.
Are you kidding?
No. I invited her to dinner, and she said yes.
Can you please hold this for a second?
Yes.
Did he dive?
Go Furio!
Bravo!
Tell me about Hans.
I saw you this morning in the jacuzzi.
-Did you kiss? -Yes.
But it was one of those kisses that happen after three drinks.
Be honest. From one to five stars, how would you rate me?
I don't know. You're not a hotel.
I know, but looking at me, would you think
"Sexy, I'd ride him all night,"
"Cute, I can't wait to introduce him to my grandma,"
or "What excuse should I make up to run away?"
Furio, listen, just breathe.
Which of the three?
Can I tell you something? Your whistle was very cool.
-Really? -No, it was horrible.
But it was cute how much it meant to you.
Your lucky charm.
And it's a pity you're not wearing it because of someone who doesn't like you.
You're so bitter I'm getting an ulcer.
-Bye then. -Bye.
-Cheers. -Make the glasses touch.
Thank you.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
Excuse me.
I ordered pepperoni pizza.
These are the peperoni, miss.
-He's right. -Really?
Those are peperoni.
-For you, pepperoni is salami, right? -Yes.
-Those are peperoni for us. It's good. -Yes?
So, as I was saying, we were in Greece last summer.
On my yacht.
My friend Giorgio was invited too.
Who's Giorgio?
Armani.
Furio, you're going too far.
Well, call him.
-Right now? -Yes.
Right, why don't you call him?
I heard that he's here on holiday. It's your friend, so…
-Maybe we can take a dive in his pool. -Please.
-A dive. -Yes.
You know how it is. He's King Giorgio.
He's got the runway shows, all the things around the world.
He's probably having dinner now.
Or sleeping, maybe.
My phone is dead anyway.
-Dead? -Right. It's off.
It's dead. What a pity.
-Dead. -Yes, it is.
Baby.
Baby, no.
You little shit! Furio.
King Giorgio?
It was impossible to not laugh.
Guys, I have to go.
-Already? -Yes.
Baby? Yes.
Yes, thank you.
No, no appetizers for me.
Okay, bye baby. Going to dinner again?
Yes, I had to fit in two for tonight.
Well, bye then.
-Bye. -Bye.
-Bye. -Bye.
-Bye. -Bye. Bye? Rebecca?
Bye? Rebecca?
Excuse me, Rebecca.
I just wanted to tell you
that we are going to the fiord by bike tomorrow morning,
and from there you can see the best sunset in the Amalfi Coast,
I was wondering if you would…
-Tomorrow morning at sunset? -No!
Right, we're going to see the sunrise.
Listen, would you mind paying for my raw dish?
-I should pay for… Sure. -Yes.
-Thank you. -It's okay.
-Bye. -Bye.
Screw that.
Damn.
Forty-five minutes.
For what?
For her to know me and dump me.
I have to dump you too, guys.
-Come on. -I know, I got invited
to my friend's birthday party, I forgot.
Let's say midnight at the square?
-Okay. -See you later.
I'm not as charming as Hans,
but I am a bit more reliable.
What are you doing here?
Nat, I don't know anything about girls,
but I know something about boys.
It's not what you're thinking.
-What a shitty holiday. -Yes.
Okay, we're going shopping now. We'll see you when you get back.
Okay. Bye, darling.
In case she comes.
Furio, she's a friend of Hans, so I wouldn't count on her.
Girls. Am I hallucinating or are you seeing her too?
-We see her too. -Nat, you have to come with us, please.
I need someone to laugh at my jokes.
Nat.
Nat, please.
I'll pay you.
-You'll pay me? -I'll pay you.
-No, please. -Cami.
Hans said it's a wonderful place that we won't see again.
-Come on. What's wrong? -Vincenzo said he would join us.
So what?
-So it's something he can't do. -He can't do it, so you don't do it?
-We don't have bikes. -Hans, do you have more bikes?
Hi. Yes.
-Hi, Rebecca. -Hi, Furio.
Are you coming as well?
Yes, apparently.
Okay, let's go.
-Nat? -Yes?
-Give me some water, please, I'm dying. -Sure.
Stop.
We're lucky, it's a lovely day.
It's August in Amalfi, what did you expect?
-Can you carry my backpack? -Sure.
Thanks, I don't want to get tan lines.
I wanted to do it the other night, but…
Do you realize that you're always ending your phrases with a "but"?
Come on, let's go with Vincenzo and Roberto. We'll have fun.
No, you go. I'll go see a friend.
Oh. I didn't know you had friends here in Amalfi.
He's a colleague.
He's here on holiday too.
Are you sure everything is okay?
What if I asked you?
Last one in pays for the drinks.
Come on!
Come on, you were already running.
It's weird getting drunk with your parents.
Being all together is weird too.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Why did you go away?
I couldn't take it, Vinz.
I was so afraid of not being a good father
that in the end, I haven't been one at all.
Sometimes, I'm afraid too, but I don't go away.
And when I want to do something, I give it everything I've got
and try anything to make it happen.
I don't look for a plan B.
I missed you a lot.
It's been hard.
I know.
I don't think you do.
You used some app to edit the pictures, right?
No.
No.
I lost 20 kilos in three months.
I thought that maybe my life would change for the better.
But it didn't happen.
Maybe before, only one guy out of a thousand looked at me,
but he wanted me for what I was.
For the full package.
Now everyone looks at me, it's true…
but they look at me because I look good,
and they don't care about the rest.
Like my ex.
What did he do?
He cheated on me and dumped me.
Let's go there.
But the past doesn't go away.
You're not the only one who wants to hide.
Well, you were definitely chubbier.
But I think you were also less bitchy. That's my feeling.
Do you have her number? Maybe I can…
Don't do this ever again.
That's better.
Hello.
Come here, come on. They have wonderful wines.
It's beautiful here.
Ravello 2013. I'll drink this.
Sorry, I'm still here with my friend.
I'll see you later, okay?
Okay, bye.
Come on.
Hi Cami, we're going on a boat trip with my dad this weekend. Are you coming?
Anyway, I'm about to come back. Did you finish your shopping?
I can join you if you like.
Hi, baby.
Sounds nice. We can talk about it later.
It's actually taking longer than expected.
I mean, Nat tried on a thousand dresses,
but she doesn't like any of them,
so it's a bit difficult, we've gone a bit far.
I think it'll be better if we meet at home later.
What do you think?
Kisses.
Furio. Keep up, come on.
That's easy for you to say.
Would you like to take a picture?
Yeah, sure.
-We can stand here, there's good light. -I mean, you take a picture of me.
-Oh, so I'll take… -Yes.
Sure, I'll take it. Step back.
You have to get the bridge as well.
Vertically, I can't post it otherwise.
The bridge is horizontal, if I take it vertically…
Lay on the ground.
So I should…
-Sure. -Okay.
You look beautiful. Here.
That's horrible.
I can't even post this.
Take it yourself then.
Pardon?
Do it yourself, if you don't like mine.
What's your problem?
I have many problems.
The biggest one being I always fall for bitches.
It's not your fault. It's my problem, actually.
I've done everything to make you like me.
Look what the hell I'm wearing.
I never wore loafers, and we're biking!
All this for a bitch like you. Come on!
-What the hell. -Hey.
-Leave me alone. -You can post the picture, it's nice.
You can…
Furio, what's wrong with you?
I asked you not to mess it up. Her party is tomorrow.
Furio has finally grown some balls, and you worry about a party?
Yes.
That's what lets you down.
You don't care about anyone.
Nat, I can't solve your problems.
Maybe that kiss meant more to you than it did to me. What can I do about it?
Darling?
Lucio?
Oh, God.
You missed out on something really nice.
But I'm glad you weren't there, because…
not even at my bachelorette party have I had that much to drink.
My head spins like a carnival.
But it wasn't just me.
Roberto and Vincenzo drank too.
And they laughed.
Darling, where are you?
Lucio?
-Furio? -What?
Did Rebecca tell you to piss off?
Can you tell how people feel by the way they sit?
Give me your sunglasses. I'm taking you places.
-No Vinz, I'm not in the mood. -Come on, trust me.
Okay, but let me get changed. I feel like a moron dressed like this.
-What did she say? -I don't know.
I'm taking the tape off. It's pissing me off.
No, leave it. Put the glasses back on.
If you stay next to me, you won't bump into anything, trust me.
You just have to focus on everything else.
But what's everything else?
Fu, listen, since I met you
you're obsessed with the fact that you can't find the right girl,
that she doesn't exist, that you're a loser.
-It's a fact. -Okay.
But how are you looking for her?
How should I? How everyone does.
Exactly, you're looking for someone who is nice to look at.
-So what should I do then? -Try focusing on the other senses.
Except the easiest one.
Your method isn't working, anyway.
Okay, but don't make fun of me.
Careful.
Don't worry, I'll be there in two minutes.
What does that girl's voice tell you?
What girl?
You're not getting it. A girl with a beautiful voice
just passed by, and you didn't get it.
Do you know how much you can understand
from the tone of a girl's voice?
No.
You can understand a lot. If she stammers, she's insecure.
From her tone, you can understand if she's happy or sad.
From the intonation, you can tell if you can rely on her.
If she says what she feels without looking for the right words…
Very poetic, but I don't have this talent. You do.
-But that's not true. -Hi guys.
Hi.
Let me give you a kiss.
Tell Camilla she can keep the bike until the end of the holiday.
-The bike? -Yes, the bike.
The one she took to go with the boys.
What bike?
It was something we couldn't have done together.
-So what? -I knew you would feel bad about it.
But you still could have told me.
Fucking tell me, Cami. Because today is the bike, tomorrow is some other thing.
How much bullshit can we tell each other?
I made a mistake. I could have told you.
But you always pretend that everything is normal,
when it's not normal.
Sorry.
If we want to be together, we have to tell each other everything.
You're right. We have to tell each other everything.
A professor from the university asked me to work for him as an assistant.
To do some research.
But it would mean another year in Canada.
I wanted to tell you, I swear. I tried many times,
but you were so happy for the job Irene found for you,
and you planned all the details,
but you forgot to ask me a fundamental thing.
What I thought about it.
You don't want commitment, Cami?
A thing without sacrifice, a story without…
That's what you've been saying since you got here.
As long as we were apart, everything was working fine, but now…
It's just that I don't want to have everything already planned.
I don't picture us when we're old.
I don't want to know where we'll be, what we'll do.
Because that would mean we hadn't lived a minute,
that we had followed a preset path,
and I don't want my life to be like that.
I hate the unexpected, you know.
They make me freak out.
But at least they force you to change direction,
to ask yourself what you really want.
Do you really want that?
Is it really the flat that you're scared of?
Why don't you tell me the truth?
Why don't you just say it? You're scared of me.
"Do you want to know what I think? That you're being unfair."
"It's been months since I last kissed someone because…" No.
"That night, I opened myself up with you." No, it's not working.
"Everything is a game for you." That's it.
"But it's not a game."
-"That's what I wanted to tell you." -What did you want to tell me?
Nothing, I was looking for Hans.
-He'll come later. -Okay.
Come on in, I'll make you some coffee.
All right.
Be careful.
I'm German, but I can make coffee better than Neapolitans.
Yes.
It's missing a piece.
He looked happy.
Yes, it was a girlfriend he had, well…
Thank you.
They met at a beach party.
And they went to live together in Berlin the next month.
Nobody could stop them.
I'd never seen Hans happier than that.
Then one day, he woke up and she wasn't there.
All of her things were still there, but she wasn't.
Why did she leave?
They thought that summer magic could become their daily life.
But it didn't work out.
And from that day on, Hans never let anyone into his world again.
He always says the summer is like a scam
that makes things look better than they actually are.
Hey.
My marriage too comes from a summer love.
But we've been lucky.
That summer is still lasting.
It's been 20 years.
Have you ever felt lost at a crossroads, not knowing which direction to take?
That's exactly how I feel with Camilla.
That's what's happening between your mom and I.
We were going to Sicily, but she was very anxious.
So I decided to come here to Amalfi.
I wanted to ask her to marry me.
-You want to marry my mother? -Yes.
And I wanted to do it here.
I wanted her to share this moment with you.
Anyway,
enough talking about old people's heartbreaks.
Let's talk about you instead.
Why does nobody trust me?
I understand you more than you think.
You have a lot of dreams.
I had a lot too, when I was your age.
I had to give up many of my dreams to take care of Vincenzo,
but I had no choice, as he was my son.
For you, it's different.
Living with Vincenzo is hard. It's a difficult path to take.
To choose to live with a blind person,
well, few people manage to do that.
I don't know if I'm one of them.
Vincenzo has already been through enough suffering when his dad left.
If you decide to be with him,
but then decide to take a step back for whatever reason,
that would be something he wouldn't be able to take.
And you would risk regretting a lot.
Let go of all doubts and fears. Come on, you can do it.
If Vincenzo feels you don't trust him, you'll never go anywhere.
Well, I know I'm not a good example of trust.
I'm a mom, that's my excuse.
But if you two don't trust each other, everything else falls apart.
-Vincenzo. -Lucio.
He says they're going scuba diving.
Scuba diving?
So cool!
It's wonderful!
Go.
So, shoulder strap one and two.
Okay.
If Mom sees me…
If she sees me…
So, here's the regulator.
Give me your hand. That's it.
Always keep it in your mouth, never let go of it.
-Like this? -Right, like that.
Good. So.
-Are you okay? -Yes.
Yes. How deep is it though?
Eight or ten meters.
Remember what we talked about.
Backflip, we slide into the water, and nothing bad will happen.
Yes.
You know what?
It's not just what your mother thinks.
It's that every reasonable person would think that what we're about to do
is quite a dangerous thing.
That's exactly why I want to do it.
Are you ready? Come on.
Mask.
All right. I'll count to three.
Ready?
One, two, and three.
That was amazing.
I swear.
There was an incredible silence.
And I could feel the pressure of the sea,
I could feel the temperature going down…
I mean, it was crazy.
-No fear? -No fear at all.
Vincenzo.
Sweetheart.
Are you okay?
I feel great. It's one of the best things I've ever done, I swear.
I've been worried the whole day.
Are you crazy? Taking Vincenzo scuba diving?
Mom, don't start. Everything went fine, don't worry.
You know how anxious I am, and you do this to me?
But everything has gone well.
I just wanted him to try something new.
Vincenzo is not your son. You don't get to say what's right for him.
Nobody should get to say what's right for him, actually.
We'll talk about it later.
You've been irresponsible. You made her worry.
Dad, you too? We've been extra careful.
What if I wanted to take a risk for once?
There's no problem.
Not at the expense of the peace of mind of those who love you.
-Lucio decided for everyone. -I decided, okay?
I don't need anybody to make decisions for me.
As much as I don't need glasses that remind me of what I don't have.
The fact is you never accepted the fact that I'm blind.
And your presents do nothing but remind me.
Hi, Cami.
Today is a very special day for me.
Because I understood how important it is to be free,
to do what you want without worrying about being a burden for others.
I know how important that job is to you,
so that's why I want you to take it.
Because after this, there will be many other things that you'll want to do,
for which I'd only be a hurdle.
I'll get by, as always.
I always find my way to do all things.
And I'm used to bumping into things that hurt.
You know, all my relationships end in a bad way.
Always.
But your story can have a different ending.
You can save it.
What, 20,000 kilometers apart?
Do you know how much it takes to go away?
I did everything I could with Camilla, but it was useless.
Where will I find another girl like her?
Fu, are you listening to me?
Vinz, what do I know?
I know nothing about relationships.
Do I ask for your advice about getting a driving license?
No. So why are you asking me for love advice?
What I know is that if we count the days you spent together,
they would sum up to a month, which is a short time.
I mean,
for me, that's a lot, like I would pay for that,
but it's a short time for normal people.
Give yourselves time.
Let her know you without worrying, without hurry, without plans.
Vinz, you get pissed off if someone worries
when you dive from a cliff, or if you don't answer the phone.
I wish I had someone who worries about every stupid thing I do.
You're lucky.
Can you leave me alone for a minute, Fu?
Hey.
Thank you.
Everything okay, miss?
Yes, I'm fine, thank you.
Don't make me worry, miss, you're the same age as my niece.
What are you doing here all alone?
And you?
Miss, I'm the one who lights up Amalfi.
I've been an electrician for 50 years.
But I don't think an electrician is enough
to light up your smile.

All in all, this holiday has been a good one.
Vincenzo and Camilla want to break up without a reason,
Irene and Lucio hate each other,
and you've paid a killer to eliminate Hans.
But at least, as for me,
surprise, nobody was interested.
Do you know what the real surprise would have been?
-What? -You managing to eat that king prawn
like a normal person, what is that?
Sorry, I'm late.
I'll stay an extra hour, I'll clean the kitchen.
You choose, it's fine by me. I'm very sorry.
Please don't make that face. I know you're mad.
-Go to the tables. -Thanks.
How was it, guys? Good?
Do you want another one?
Are you okay?
Wait, let me guess.
You bite your nails when you lie,
you make lots of jokes that people don't get…
-and you have a goldfish for a pet. -What?
Nothing.
Those are my friend's superpowers. I don't have them--
Shit. I did a…
-Don't worry… -I…
You didn't get any of them.
But you can try again if you want.
I'm Anna.
Furio.
Hey. I know it's late, but I've been thinking a lot about this.
Would you mind coming to the square at midnight? Please.
I'll be waiting for you.
It wasn't me.
Oh, God. I think the power went out. The switch is in the cellar.
Don't fall down the stairs.
-Aren't you coming? -No.
I think it's better if you go with him.
-All right. -Bring some light.
Wait for me then.
God, I'm so nervous.
Don't worry.
You don't have power as well?
The power is out in the whole town.
There's a blackout.
-Vinz. -Cami.
Did the power go out?
Guess who did that.
Now we're even.
I want to show you that I trust you.
-Come. -To where?
Where I've gone biking with the others.
But you said the road is dangerous.
I know.
Come.
Can I have my half?
How did you find me?
I've got my sources.
A quirky guy with curly hair?
Be careful, mind your step. Stay close.
Shouldn't you be at the party?
Yes.
But I'm starting to realize what's important to me.
Careful, here it gets narrower.
Listen to the sea.
What are you doing?
I love you.
I love you too.
No, I love you more.
No way.
-I love you more. -No.
Yes.
-It's not about how long the tongue is-- -Furio.
Hi, Mom.
Would you believe me if I said there's something you don't know about me?
To have some memories, sometimes I make recordings
so that I can listen to them when I want,
and you never realize I'm stealing your voices.
That's it, now you know almost everything about me.
Have you ever felt lost at a crossroads, not knowing which direction to take?
That's exactly how I feel with Camilla.
That's what's happening between your mom and I.
We were going to Sicily, but she was very anxious.
So I decided to come here to Amalfi.
I wanted to ask her to marry me.
-You want to marry my mother? -Yes.
And I wanted to do it here.
I wanted her to share this moment with you.
One last thing.
I'm bad at relationships too.
But this doesn't mean we're made wrong.
I'm not even good at giving advice,
so I feel the weight of the responsibility,  now that I'm doing it.
But I have the feeling you're waiting for an excuse
to avoid starting your new life.
Because new things are scary,
but it's not because of Dad… but because what you have with Lucio
feels so big to you
that you're looking for a reason not to put yourself into it.
That's why you turn your head to see what you left behind,
instead of letting the future surprise you.
I love you, Mom.
I'M GOING HOME, I'M LEAVING YOU THE CAR. I'LL MAKE DO. LUCIO.
-Irene. -Roberto.
Do you know when the next ferry leaving from Amalfi is?
I don't know.
Why don't you come to Capri with us this weekend?
Just me, Vincenzo and you. What…
You can't come here and mess everything up.
I don't deny asking myself if it was worth it to try again,
but I won't go back.
The past should stay in the past.
You can't erase ten years in one week. Come on.
You know what?
I thought I wasn't up to it.
That I couldn't make you happy.
Then someone came and made me realize that I'm not that bad,
that I'm not always the problem,
that together, it's possible to find a solution.
Maybe now that I'm 50, I can try being happy too.
-Sorry, I have to go. -I'll give you a ride.
Faster, come on, the ferry is leaving soon!
Irene.
Good luck.
Your ticket, please.
-Sorry, I don't have one. Let me through. -I can't.
Let me through, It's urgent. I'll pay inside. Lucio!
-Let me through, I said. Lucio! -I can't!
Lucio, sweetheart.
This morning, when I woke up and you weren't there, I…
What was that line?
I wish that waking up together
was our daily life.
I wish that too.
-Ma'am. -I wish that too.
-Ma'am! -Yes?
I have to ask her to follow me.
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
Ma'am.
I have to ask you to kindly leave the ship.
Come on, stop it.
Oh, God. It's absurd.
-There's a step. -I know.
Wouldn't it have been better to get dressed?
Yes, it's a shitty idea, actually.
Careful.
-Are you hurt? -I was about to kill myself.
-The crab is gone? -The crab? How?
The statue.
What's this?
I think somebody traded it for something a bit more useful. Like what?
Plane tickets for Canada.
For you, it's one way.
Furio!
-Are you ready? Tell me when. -It's… yes.
Okay. Go.
Good. Put your feet up there.
Don't be scared, it goes by itself.
Okay.
-Like that, right? -Okay.
Dear, it's because you lost balance.
Keep your back straight.
Straight here, all the weight on the seat.
-Okay. -Okay.
-Never let go. -I got it.
It's okay, it's all clear ahead.
-Are you ready? -Yes.
-I'm letting go. -No, Cami. Wait.
Okay, I can do it.
-Careful, there's a hedge on the left. -Okay.
Okay, brake.
Now try to come back on your own.
Keep turning. There is a wall on the right.
Okay.
Go! Come here.
Straight ahead.
Keep going.
-Like that? -Come.
-You're going to Canada? -Yes.
There'll be just a bit of water between us.
What do you mean?
-When are you coming back? -I don't know, we'll see.
No change of plans this time, it's freezing in Vancouver.
I am very happy for them, actually.
I am happy for you. Sorry…
I'm not feeling very well.
-Oh! -What did I say?
Not again.
Hurry up!
Here! Play for the sun to rise.
-I can't. -You can.
-Not sure I can. -You can. Be creative!
Go, play!
-I can't. -Yes, you can. Go!
SÃO PAULO OPERA HOUSE NOVEMBER, 2019
-He's good, isn't he? -He's making the sun rise.
He's made the sun rise!
Wow! Just like Orpheus.
-You are Orpheus now. -No.
Yes, take this little flower.
Play a little song for me? Will you?
He's made the sun rise!
The man is back.
The lunch lady gets off The bus leaves
Miss Maria is far gone Only then the sun rises
At dawn, Spiders weave their webs in the dark
And panting lovers Go into the arms of Morpheus
And the sun, it only comes out later
The sun only comes out later
It’s the king star, okay But it only comes out later
The sun only comes out later
Announced by the barking dogs The crowing of roosters
The serenity of mothers
Who want their offspring safe and say,
"Take your ID, kid" Mornings in São Paulo
Vietnam style
A candle blown by the wind Comforting when it's done
Embers running cold Smoke dancing alone
The night dew bathing plants as tears
The moon is already out in Japan What a small world
Fragments of a silly dream Shaped by the light
Tidy up the room It'll get remodeled this year
Noisy kids Off to school confirm
Beans do grow in cotton
Life always wins
And clouds, curious as they are,
Dress themselves up With curly elderly hair
Walk slowly up to the firmament
Deep down they're disguised as fog
To see love in both worlds
The lunch lady gets off The bus leaves
Miss Maria is far gone Only then the sun rises
At dawn, Spiders weave their webs in the dark
And panting lovers Go into the arms of Morpheus
And the sun, it only comes out later
The sun only comes out later
It’s the king star, okay But it only comes out later
The sun only comes out later
The lunch lady gets off The bus leaves
Miss Maria is far gone Only then the sun rises
At dawn, Spiders weave their webs in the dark
And panting lovers Go into the arms of Morpheus
And the sun, it only comes out later
The sun only comes out later
It’s the king star, okay But it only comes out later
The sun only comes out later
Ladies and gentlemen, MC Tha.
The sun only comes out later
The sun only comes out later
The sun only comes
The sun only comes out later
The sun only comes out later
Only comes out later
He's made the sun rise!
I'll add bebop to my samba When Uncle Sam hits the tambourine
Only when he hits the pandeiro And the zabumba
When he understands That samba isn't rumba
Then I'll mix
Miami and Copacabana
I'll mix gum with banana
And my samba will sound like this
I think music is a divine thing, you know?
It comes from here. Music is the voice of the soul.
A soul speaking.
It's like painting a picture or being a surgeon.
The soul is the protagonist, right?
Art.
Not everyone has that, but everyone has one.
Art chose me, not the other way around.
It charmed me.
Time teaches it all.
If you got a friend, you got it all
If you're down Friends come to the rescue
It's so rad That all the stress is easy to overcome
It's a safe place when things get surreal
If you got a friend, you got it all
If bullets are flying, brother Friends act as shields
Ready for anything at any moment
A shoulder to cry on After the end of the world
Being bros like Gil and Caetano It’s a rare thing in this crazy world
I've been through so much hardship
But I made it back And I'm gonna keep on going
It's like a baroque rococo In which Aleijadinho was a king
God's gift, how many times we laughed
Like in the catechism When I asked Oxalá and Our Lady
Hey, where do you live now? I'll pay you a visit someday
Being bros like Gil and Caetano It’s a rare thing in this crazy world
I've been through so much hardship
But I made it back And I'm gonna keep on going
It's like a baroque rococo In which Aleijadinho was a king
God's gift, how many times we laughed
Like in the catechism When I asked Oxalá and Our Lady
Hey, where do you live now? I'll pay you a visit someday
So many comings and goings That sing beautiful stories
Samba's still playing In Camba from Cabinda
Like an Aruanda realm Plants, water, and a jar
Brave ones never give up Find comfort with their godmother
They come back like the sun, enlightened Inspiration breaking through the dark
Share what you have And you'll live forever
A humble reminder that's in the chorus
Like this
If you got a friend, you got it all
If you're down Friends come to the rescue
It's so rad That all the stress is easy to overcome
It's a safe place when things get surreal
If you got a friend, you got it all
When bullets are flying, brother, Friends act as a shield
Ready for anything at any moment
A shoulder to cry on After the end of the world
A friend is the wizard of a warm embrace
It’s affection, a safe haven
An oasis amid the darkness When you get knocked down
An oasis amid the darkness When you get knocked down And everything falls through
A friend is the wizard of a warm embrace
It’s affection, a safe haven
An oasis amid the darkness When you get knocked down
An oasis amid the darkness When you get knocked down And everything falls through
It's like this!
If you got a friend, you got it all
If you got a friend, you got it all
If you got a friend, you got it all
If you got a friend, you got it all
If you got a friend, you got it all
If you got a friend, you got it all
If you got a friend, you got it all
If you got…
So lucky!
If you got a friend, you got it all
When you're down Friends come to the rescue
It's so rad That all the stress is easy to overcome
It's a safe place when things get surreal
If you got a friend, you got it all
When bullets are flying, brother Friends act as a shield
Ready for anything at any moment
A shoulder to cry on After the end of the world
Friendship
Not even time can destroy it
We are the truth
Not even this samba of love Can sum us up
Time teaches it all.
I wanna cry your tears
I wanna smile with you
I am thankful that you exist, my friend
Time teaches it all.
I wanna cry your tears
I wanna smile with you
Thank you for existing
My friend
Thank you very much.
Good evening.
Good evening!
This is a gorgeous opera house.
Very beautiful indeed.
I believe
today's the most beautiful day it's seen.
Be careful on the trapeze
Even if desperate modern times Weigh us down
A thumbs up for hate, man In that case
Soon common sense will say "Take a deep breath"
You gotta learn Blackboard and chalk
Let your spirit rest Pray and get back 100%
Shut the world off Think about how life is worth it
Be the light on a cloudy day
And she said, "May God be with you, boo, good day"
Kissed me, turned it into poetry
"God be with you, boo"
A glimpse of pure love Bursting with happiness
"God be with you, boo"
Come back to us Like a soccer player after scoring a goal
Full heart, sparkling eyes
That's what family's about My soul said, "About time"
I will face whatever comes for her
Face the struggles For the little joys of adulthood
I will
I will go to battle like a warrior
Even if I have to take on The entire planet
Run a marathon, get first place And shout, "It's all for you, babe"
I will face whatever comes for her
Face the struggles For the little joys of adulthood
I will
I will go to battle like a warrior
Even if I have to take on The entire planet
Run a marathon, get first place And shout, "It's all for you, babe"
All right!
A peaceful Saturday You can sleep in
The goal of the match To avoid relegation
Long weekend on the beach
Find a Tupperware With the matching lid
Earlier today Rosemary blossomed quietly
I thought it'd be just crabgrass
She complains it's sour Gathers all the toys
Victory to me Is a positive report card
Diapers on sale at the drugstore
Extra money from overtimeat work
Gifts in watercolor and tissue paper Make my day
I guess God's dreams Might be something like that
I will face whatever comes for her
Face the struggles For the little joys of adulthood
I will
I will go to battle like a warrior
Even if I have to take on The entire planet
Run a marathon, get first place And shout, "It's all for you, babe"
I will face whatever comes for her
Face the struggles For the little joys of adulthood
I will
I will go to battle like a warrior
Even if I have to take on The entire planet
Run a marathon, get first place And shout, "It's all for you, babe"
We're shooting nice images because we're making a film.
It'll be a beautiful film.
I'm yet to see it, but I know it'll be.
That's it,
enjoy.
From the bottom of my heart
From the deepest corner of my core
To this wrecked world
My writing is like a love letter
Kids, laughs, windows
Flirts, braids, yellow fabric
Red roof tiles
The crackle of the spark
Makes you feel Like you're inside a painting
Hope paints itself in watercolor
White noise From the radio, TVs, and soap operas
A trail of bees The murmur of sheep in your ears
And life goes along
On the paving stone, intrepid worker
Impetuous driver, where it all starts
Wind soothing the fast times With eclectic sounds
Record players spin the classics Beautiful absurd
Suffocating metropolis Like untouchable necropolis
They collide with someone's dream
They are Sunday killers Pausing every beautiful thing
Everyone who feels the same Is also my friend
This one comes From the bottom of my heart
From the deepest corner of my core
To this wrecked world
My writing is like a love letter
From the bottom of my heart
This one comes from the bottom of my heart
From the deepest corner of my core
To this wrecked world
This one is also a prayer
My writing is like a love letter
Star, moon, and firefly
Termites playing like schooling fish
Bonfires bring back stories Recalling old memories
Noémia de Sousa called it "lume"
The night toasts with blackness
The breeze sways the flowers Spreading the scent
There’s no escaping From the singing cicada
So familiar with the song It makes us jealous
On the paving stone, intrepid worker
Impetuous driver, where it all starts
Wind soothing the fast times With eclectic sounds
Record players spin the classics Beautiful absurd
Suffocating metropolis Like untouchable necropolis
They collide with someone's dream
They are Sunday killers Pausing every beautiful thing
Everyone who feels the same Is also my friend
This one comes
Wanna record it too?
Baby
Baby
From the bottom of my heart
We can decorate the girls' hair With yellow flowers.
From the deepest corner of my core
Boys' hair too.
To this wrecked world
Life will taste like dessert With all these colors
My writing is like a love letter
Love letters to everybody Everybody
Baiana, you messed me up
I'm crazy about Your nago color, your beads
Yeah, your laugh is like Olodum Playing at Pelô
Femadum Day, drum, joy
If it reminds me of malê, I really like it
Dique do Tororó, Oyó Empire
Coming down from Orum, beautiful Oxum
There's nothing like it anywhere
The white sand of the Abaeté Lagoon
It's in your smile, I just lose my mind
The mermaid's smoothly singing And I'm idling
Game over, my boo, I get axé high
My head is spinning
With that one kiss On the tip of my lips
Spinning
You know how?
With that one kiss, just one kiss
My head is spinning
With that one kiss On the tip of my lips
Spinning
With that one kiss, just one kiss
Sivuca on the drums, everyone!
Baiana, it’s good to have you here
In Salvador here, Salvador Dali
Bahia by the hands of Master Didi
The sun darkens The shade of the Cariri
It's the myth in Yoruba, so beautiful
Amaralina water, drop of moonlight
A visual delight, a rite of passage
Reminded me of Clementina's singing
February 2nd, day of the Queen
White for some Pretty Black for us
Like Our Lady, my patroness
Bathing in popcorn, shell necklace
The pagode at Ribeira's line
Cajazeiras, Baixa do Tubo Steady down the slope
A flood of colors Reminded me of Raimundo de Oliveira
My heart, your position, the first
My head is spinning
With that one kiss On the tip of my lips
Spinning
With that one kiss, just one kiss
My head is spinning
With that one kiss On the tip of my lips
Spinning
With that one kiss, just one kiss
Sivuca!
Bahia of Gil, Bahia of Gal
Bahia of Caetano and Dorival
Bahia of Gil, Bahia of Gal
Bahia of Caetano and Dorival
Bahia of Gil, Bahia of Gal
Bahia of Caetano and Dorival
Bahia of Gil, Bahia of Gal
Bahia of Caetano and Dorival
Madagascar nights
How many stars I've seen in your eyes
Things I can get used to
Easily
Beautiful night!
I can easily get used to
Blue sky, green sea
Birds singing
These are the things I can easily get used to
I can easily get used to
Life in a snap, a film noir
Sexy, classy, Renoir
As if they danced, leaves, waves
A beautiful scent in the air In this world of Oduduwa
Oh, with Afro skin
God help us, Pablo Neruda Bless the One Hundred Love Sonnets
I live in Mia Couto's verses
Where I laughed And the sounds matched
They teach us That a good kiss never ends
It's surreal Those who hurt you also hurt me
Yeah, it's painful
With the caress of the wind, we sprawl out
Laying back lazily, time on our side
If pain is a cactus Let's make a pact
Since you dig a plan
Let the waves lick our feet To wash away our setbacks
I love the Madagascar nights
How many stars I've seen in your eyes
These are the things I can easily get used to
I can easily get used to
Blue sky, green sea
Birds singing
These are the things I can easily get used to
I can easily get used to
Let's give a hand to our brass family!
Treat them as ladies
Ladies
Not as gagas
Honey, baby
So nice to cuddle
What I wanted, happily I dreamed, I thought
Being happy is much better Than being a king
Hey, girl
I say, hey, even our zodiac signs, see? We match
Your merlot kiss and your fine pearl smile
Won me over and lit up my eyes
Oh, that açaí berry mouth of yours
I dress up nicely
I would even break into nightmares To save you
To be your cameo brooch A smooth player or a nerd
With one of your glances A GPS would get lost
A single dose
Divided into two glasses
A single soul
Divided into two bodies
I know the best If you're in, I'm in
I'll stick to you
-A single dose -A single dose
Divided into two glasses
-A single soul -A single soul
Divided into two bodies
I know the best If you're in, I'm in
I'll stick to you
I'll stick to you
I'll stick to you
I was 14 or 15
Around the same time My bros were pushing at 16
Today at 33, criminal offense At 12, I already knew
We stuck together in loneliness Hand in hand, no restraints
Easy talk, she'd go where I'd go
Hand and glove, in these gloomy streets
In the alley in the cold of night
In this scary world She gave me courage, you know?
Great chemistry, bro
Perfect match, we fit together
The other ones were rough, thugs, trouble
But not her She was well looked after, brilliant
She never loses her poise
Crafty, quick-witted Like a fire-cracking washerwoman
Spitting fire
You don't wanna see that side of her
I'm with her again
Babe
Oh babe Someday we'll be on the news
Oh babe, sweet babe
Someday we will
Oh babe Oh babe Someday we'll be on the news
Oh babe, sweet babe
Someday we will
Opera House, this is my friend, Drik Barbosa!
Good evening!
Our first time was awful
Fearful eyes, sweat
Thinking, "Will I be better at this someday?"
Maybe when I’m drunk
Damn, a shitload of blood Leave all that shit behind, run
Our first fight, we didn't have a clue
Crazy ideas Whatever I said got a lot of attention
The way she gets angry
Goes from Bonnie and Clyde to Maria Bonita
And shines Your warm mouth in my groin
It almost burns, what a ride Rules, Kamikaze
What we have is so rare
Crazy thing is, to have a bit of fun, We pay a high price sometimes
Babe
Oh babe Someday we'll be on the news
Oh babe, sweet babe
Someday we will
Oh babe, sweet babe
We'll be on the news
Oh babe, sweet babe
Someday we will
This excitement is so crazy
Dangerous and exciting You feel me?
Delightfully risky
Over the top
And the fear spices it up
It's a magical spice
With a tragic ending
I like her so much I wanna be close, and that's it
There's no other way to see me smiling It's crazy the effect she has on me
I like her so much I want to be close, and that's it
There's no other way to see me smiling It's crazy the effect she has on me
She's a Leo, girly, bossy
Gorgeous, knows her fate, brave chick Dashing, stubborn queen, merrymaker
She unveils the new and ends the mess
Light of your eyes, loathes tackiness
Amazon warrior and ballerina, so pretty
She is glittery, skinny, and all dolled up
And also, coffee on the couch at 9 a.m.
Sets her own agenda, busy mommy Yo-yo effect, thinks she's a weirdo
Caffeine, passion fruit, cheeky lady
Ugly on a bad day But always a beautiful lady
Master of the home and popstar, Madonna
Stingy, dancing, opinionated Smiling, striking a pose
Wants to be my little girl And a big girl to the world
My good deal, bumpkin, tough
I like her so much I want to be close, and that's it
There's no other way to see me smiling It's crazy the effect she has on me
I like her so much I want to be close, and that's it
There's no other way to see me smiling It's crazy the effect she has on me
Drik Barbosa, everybody!
I like her so much
I like her so much
I like her so much
Thank you very much.
Smells like gunpowder, icy cold
You see so many trees now
Our kidnappers are rewarded
Our surroundings now belong to the rats
That time when the folklore is colored red
Crazy how little it helps, but pray
If we’re lucky, it might get worse
Don't fool yourself, nothing truly changes Just contemplate the flowers
And light the fire, rub your hands
Unbutton your shirt
Feel at home, picture the summer
Ignore the breeze's radiation
Put an old jazz tune on your stereo
A sterile nightmare That has lasted far too long
We need to truly recognize That evil outsmarted us
As a cemetery should be Everything is at peace
At peace
At peace
At peace
At peace
Everything is at peace
At peace
At peace
At peace
Everything is at peace
The burden of the days We toast with bile
Dead silence allows us to hear The clouds touching the sky
A dark lighthouse Pharaoh descendants left barehanded
A sad scene insists In making you a protagonist
Somewhere between the streets and my soul
Stampede and high libido With a call to calm down
We get high on likes
Social media gives us what we want
While stealing what we need For nothing is forever, nothing
Warm kisses, fairies Everything fades, man
Smell the breath, caress
Pale face, fuck
I want some solace, stop These sadistic times, face it
Worthless dreams, wake up
Anxiety eats you up like rust A vertigo-induced ride
See monsters appearing From a smokey valley
Who would say narrow-mindedness Turns monetary poverty into a trifle
The news says, "Take it easy, Wait and see, everything is at peace"
At peace
At peace
At peace
At peace
Everything is at peace
At peace
At peace
At peace
At peace
At peace
At peace
Everything is at peace
Give it up for Michelle on the guitar.
Early today
When I woke up
And couldn't find you I had so many thoughts
I got scared I sobbed so hard
I suffered in silence All of this, early today
Powerful spotlight
Glitter
Those girls' smiles Remind me of cocaine
The curtains open in five
Static eyes shine, fine drizzle
Damn it, my poem brought me To where it doesn't belong
Annoying fame, money talks You're in disbelief
Puppets, like Celso Pitta, they lie
Dead like my father I don't really feel present
Rhyme is what you want? Here, take two, three
Enough to give each one of you A heart attack
A bottomless abyss, party, litany
My soul sinks Just like my family at home, alone
Among whores, like a pimp Thrown off my groove
How I dreamed of being here
A crisis, work, ideology, pause
This is where we understand Amy Winehouse
Early today
When I woke up
And couldn't find you I had so many thoughts
I got scared I sobbed so hard
I suffered in silence All of this, early today
Bum, the trail is a cliff I picture the best
I want to save the world 'Cause I gave up on my family
Facing a difficult struggle Frustration gets smaller
Pitiful, destroyed, empty, ordinary It's a trend in the 21st Century
Black people with a keen recorded voice
Against the villains Who make the hood bleed
But that same rap For us, for peace, nothing more
Got me locked me up in Gerais
It reminded me of Racionais, reflection
Black people themselves Don't even care about it, no
It's a romantic cliché, sad
Look around and see Committed suicide but there's no paradise
I'm still Emicida of Rinha
I sold-out gigs from South to North
But I emptied my home
I keep going, Taliban
Watching the playboys drinking Two months of my sister's pay
Hennessy, hazelnut Dressing room, fans, fame
Bro, where were they ten years ago?
Like they say, that's showbiz, kid
Society sells Jesus Why wouldn't it sell rap?
The world takes care of your cash
Saying that poverty Is what needed attention
Thanks, Opera House!
Early today
When I woke up
And couldn't find you I had so many thoughts
I got scared I sobbed so hard
I suffered in silence All of this, early today
Today, I can consider myself A lucky guy
Despite being very young
I feel sane, safe, and strong
And I've been thinking God is Brazilian and is by my side
So, I can't keep suffering For what happened last year
I have bled enough I have cried like a dog
Last year I died But this year, I won't die again
I have bled enough I have cried like a dog
Last year I died But this year, I won't die again
Last year I died But this year, I won't die again
Last year I died But this year, I won't die again
My dreams fly higher than drones
What fuels me? Hunger
Wreck it all like a cyclone
So tomorrow won't be like yesterday With a new name
The vulture preys on us Eager for a fall
Done with sorrow, bro I’m above this shit
Body, mind, soul, Ayurveda-style
Like water, I can flow through rocks
The plot is a heavy drama I’m the playwright
Get up from the mud Set the world on fire
No drama, I want money This is hosanna
Capulanas, katanas, nirvana is the goal
In a dog-eat-dog world Losing is not an option
From very far away Straight talk sprouts
Ain't gonna leave it Nor let it slide
We 'bout to baffle Those who laughed when we were down
I have bled enough I have cried like a dog
Last year I died But this year, I won't die again
I have bled enough I have cried like a dog
Last year I died But this year, I won't die again
Last year I died But this year, I won't die again
I'm one of a kind, glowing in the dark Straight from the hood
Wearing hoodies down the hill My bros and I
Piece in my pocket, impulsive
God and I know how it feels To have nothing, be exiled
I cut sick rhymes Almost cut my wrists
Penniless our lives worth less Than that of a sad dog
This morning, it wasn’t a hit It was a cry for help
Resentment's like a tumor Poisoning the roots
But the audience Wants to be happy, you know?
Heads in the clouds
The latest trend is depression Disguised as a vacation
Granny says, "Hating the Devil is easy Living in hell is hard"
It came to light
That the evil empire Never took you seriously
And wants to knock you down So, fight back!
I have bled enough I have cried like a dog
Last year I died But this year, I won't die again
I have bled enough I have cried like a dog
Last year I died But this year, I won't die again
Last year I died But this year, I won't die again
Allow me to speak louder than my scars
They’re secondary No, better, they're tertiary
Shouldn’t even be here
Allow me to speak louder than my scars
So much pain robbing us of our voices You know what’s left of us?
Walking targets on the streets
Allow me to speak louder than my scars
This is about living
If living is just surviving I’m being robbed of my few good moments
At last, allow me to speak louder Than my scars
The worst crime Is to let my traumas define me
To give our enemies a trophy And silence ourselves
I have bled enough I have cried like a dog
Last year I died But this year, I won't die again
I have bled enough I have cried like a dog
Last year I died
Hands in the air, Opera House! Come on!
Come on!
I have bled enough I have cried like a dog
Last year I died But this year, I won't die again
I have bled enough I have cried like a dog
Last year I died But this year, I won't die again
Last year I died But this year, I won't die again
Opera House!
Pabllo Vittar and Majur!
Little kid
Little kid
Ask where he's going Ask where he's going
Ladies and gentlemen,
give a warm welcome to my nigga, Jé Santiago!
I've cheated death Now I know where I'm headed
It ain't luck I'm where I've always wanted to be
I trust no one Let alone the police
Money in my pocket My blood ran cold
Right before the concert
Before the blow Before the blow
I was with my bros Before all the hype and the envy
I've cheated death Now I know where I'm headed
I know it wasn't luck
It was endless grudge
I made faith reverberate like a cathedral
Sacred like the Torah Deadly like corals
A voracious shark of oriental knowledge
My chant made the Atlantic A quantum detail
Find me in storms, ancestral voices
Don't measure courage In times of peace
-Jesus 2.0 style -Damn, Jesus 2.0
I walk on the waters of grief Away from this shit imposed upon me
Came from nothing, now I'm limitless Like a brand new invention
I'm not conceited, I'm convincing
What did rhymes do to the streets
Freebase to real beats, it drags us down My caste flies high, ping-pong
Cut the crap, enough, thrilled Rasta mind Yin-yang rebalanced
Angles like a filmmaker I outshine the party
Aim for the head, Kim Jong, Masta
I decide whether you're dealing With the King or the Kong
Like Aztec gold, I came from a barren life It was all like the Sahara
Abundance's the goal, like Mecca I'm Thomas Sankara, I defy, rebuild
Like a newborn, wrapped in pussy A mix of Vivara, Guevara, Lebara
My pen fucks up white history
And the world shouts "Don't stop"
Enough with the caravel fetish Just stop, fella, put it in perspective
I smash it, they call it a concept Somehow, I bring the hand of Shiva
It's God speaking through my bros
I aim to kill the KKK
Only those who cheated death up North know It ain't luck, but Eshu's will
I wear a suit for fun
Is it submission or defiance?
It was hell, I turned it around
The goal is eternity, immensity
Like bees nesting on a roof I graze black sheep that got lost
Crossovers are trending Until they call us reverse colonization
DJ Nyack!
There's no everlasting pain
There's no disturbing hate
The mission is to retrieve
Cooperate and empower
-We held back too long -Too long
-Black people don't cry, they rise -Rise
Don't beg, no white flag
Waste no time with morons It's no use
Focus and attention on rising up Fuck oppression
There's no other way Until we get things straight
From now on, real talk, no bullshit Look Black people in the eye, no fear
They say I made it, I'm not done I came, I rhymed, I won, I'm a king
Jé!
I've cheated death Now I know where I'm headed
It ain't luck I'm where I've always wanted to be
I trust no one Let alone the police
Money in my pocket My blood ran cold
Right before the concert
-Before the blow -Before the blow
-I was with my bros -Before all the hype and the envy
I've cheated death Now I know where I'm headed
I know it wasn't luck I'm where I've always wanted to be
Ladies and gentlemen, Jé Santiago!
Little kid
Ask where he's going Ask where he's going
There's an indigenous philosopher,
a man of great value,
who's been teaching me a lot with his writing.
His name is Ailton Krenak.
This bro,
with his words,
teaches us that certain people, and certain trajectories,
are collective ones.
Which means that certain journeys carry the dream
Which means that certain journeys carry the dream and the achievement of many people,
who cannot be discouraged by the reality of the world, no matter how sad it is.
The fact that we're here in this place that was denied to our ancestors,
is due to the sweat and blood of many people along the way.
If we are here, smiling inside the Opera House today,
it's thanks to some people who, at the height of a military dictatorship,
were brave enough to rise up against the Brazilian State and its murderous racism to show that the country
and its murderous racism to show that the country
needed to acknowledge the leading role of dark-skinned people in Brazilian society.
This is a magical time for me because you are here.
Because our presence here is a historical achievement.
Because of something so very special.
Our victory is worthless
if it does not release the spirit of all the people who were murdered
over five centuries of slavery.
That's why it is magical to stand in this place, and sing the things we sing.
Some of the people here today
were also at the front steps of the Opera House in 1978,
fighting racism.
And I'd like to ask them to please stand up.
Brothers and sisters from Unified Black Movement.
Thank you very much.
Without you, without your dreams, without your fight,
none of this would be possible.
This next song is dedicated to you.
My skin is Luanda Aruanda is the lobby
Like T'Challa, Wakanda Black mamba poison
Bandits in a group Who rules these lands?
Tonight you'll see more blood Than Hotel Rwanda
The era started wild Panthers on the loose
Show the black claws I wear the night like camouflage
I came to avenge the pain Of those smashed by the gears
If you're a coup, I'm Sabotage
Mystic, a thousand orishas In a pantheon, brave
I kill settlers, Put an end like a Tsavo lion
I go deep, not holding back I double down
Monster, skull, Vibranium Chop you up in 12 pieces
A flash like Usain Bolt, 10,000 volts
My ancestors cheer, check out Ta-Nehisi Coates
Good memory, short fuse Approach it and boom
Tell them I've come back like an AK!
With fierce reason and chill, bro
If things get rough, we better get back
Like a Black Panther
I'm back!
Like a Black Panther
With fierce reason and chill, bro
If things get rough, we better get back
Like a Black Panther
I'm back!
Like a Black Panther
Now on my roof, she's Dora Milaje
Sprout up like Nicki Minaj, It's a mirage
Mirage Jet, flying high, Mr. Spock
Green Lantern, I am very Static Shock
For a new Red Sea A new crossing
For people to see kings in the mirror I use my pen
Street, Wu-Tang, Superman, more technology
Symbolic like a guide on cold nights
I'll crush playboys That mock Black culture
A Kasparov toasting checkmates Writing checks
I denounce slave masters On my indie tracks
Respect my timing, rats Don't be such a brat
Bring in Stan Lee, Spike Lee, kinda Bruce Lee
And I'll bring Brazil Maurício Kubrusly style
Solange got a place at the table Black or brown?
When in doubt, call her princess
Self-knowledge, self-help
The flow of time Like samples, like Buddha
Love can fill 1,000 books Like Gabo, not Neruda
If you mess with the storm Don't carry an umbrella
Like this!
With fierce reason and chill, bro
If things get rough, we better get back
May this night…
Like a Black Panther
…stay forever in our hearts, right, bro?
To remind us that freedom isn't permanent.
We've always had to fight for it, and we'll keep on fighting.
Like a wrecking ball. Watch out!
With fierce reason and chill, bro
If things get rough, we better get back
Like a Black Panther
I'm back!
Like a Black Panther
With fierce reason and chill, bro
If things get rough, we better get back
Like a Black Panther
Like a Black Panther
On the turntable, DJ Nyack!
As much as you run, brother
Say what?
They don't care about your fight
That's the truth
Have they ever cried Over an orisha's color?
Paddy wagons, what are they?
Slave ships resuming trade
Slums are still slave quarters
Ticking bombs about to explode
Sea's salty due to black people's tears
Straight talk Like skeletons from another dialect
Only hatred, living like filthy insects
Reparations? To be tagged as lazy
Homeless nation Angola, Ketou, Congo, Soweto
Eto'o's color, the ghettos' majority
Monster kidnapping Capture three, abduct
Adapted to violence One day it comes back to you
Like concentration camps Tears in vain
Wanted a decent life, stigma, outrage
"Work sets you free," or not
The Nazi slogan Nearly wiped out the Jews to extinction
Depression on deck
Been screwed too long Not gonna laugh about it
Like Jackass, Loch Ness-like mystery
They write about you at universities Where you can't set foot on
You know, I know
Even Bin Laden is made in the USA
Crazy times where KKK wears Obey
-It's hot indeed -Look it up, told you so
In this annoying equation, police kill
Will the doctor save? No! Why?
Color of a thief
Contempt, invention, malicious intention
Mind-blowing inversion, news distortion
My blood on the hands Of Christian radicals
Transcendental issue Not shocking enough
Shut up, on the ground, familiar?
Can harassment be forgotten? The aggression drives you mad
Tabloids win when mourning is popular
Healing poor education With Police Killing
In the cyber era, you'll see
The book that stole our past Like Alzheimer's
I'll do it like in Burkina Faso
We want to run the circus We’re tired of being clowns
Like Moses and the Hebrews Stepping into the dark
Will the enemy decide what's offensive?
It's crazy!
Vengeful as water and sodium
Go!
Keep watching without custody Wait for what’s coming up next
You say we got big cocks Just wait until you witness our rage
As much as you run, brother
As much as you run!
They don't care about your fight
They don't care.
That's the truth
Have they ever cried Over an orisha's color?
Paddy wagons, what are they?
Slave ships resuming trade
Slums are still slave quarters
Ticking bombs about to explode
With the faith of those watching The scene from afar
The goal we needed the most Was a near miss
White people’s happiness is complete
Fire trail, barefoot, what a shame
Even our dreams are full of obstacles
White people’s happiness is complete
Black people’s happiness is a near miss
I looked in the mirror Icarus stared back at me
"Be careful Don’t fly too close to the sun
They can’t handle you free Imagine as a king"
Vultures wanna see you in handcuffs To say, "I told you so”
In the end, we're all Ismália
Ismália Ismália
Wanted to touch the sky Ended up on the ground
Ismália Ismália
Ismália
Wanted to touch the sky Ended up on the ground
She wanted to be called brown
To disguise the gap Between herself and humanity
Rage propels us, think about that
A filthy idea is like poison A deep pain that spreads around
A shithole country, the media likes it
Full of flaws, but wants medals From runners with fractures
Stabbed in the back
Butchered by taxes and norms
But we numb ourselves Posting about how it'll be alright
A diploma is manumission
My color is not a uniform Hashtag "Black on the top," bravo
But 80 bullets remind you There's fair skin and target skin
The shooter wore a uniform
Once more
The accuser wasn't even there
For a dead Black body Is like a hit single on the charts
Everyone sees it But that shit is meaningless
I looked in the mirror Icarus stared back at me
"Be careful Don’t fly too close to the sun
They can’t handle you free Imagine as a king"
Vultures wanna see you high To say, "I told you so”
In the end, we're all Ismália
Ismália Ismália
Wanted to touch the sky Ended up on the ground
Dark skin is
Ismália
Ismália Ismália Ismália Ismália
Wanted to touch the sky Ended up on the ground
First, kidnap them, rob them Lie about them
Deny their God, offend, divide them
If they dare to dream, stop them
Let them argue with the bullets That cut them through, bro
Sadly, where the sun's warmer
They're sealing The coffins of teenagers
Who wanted to be stars And became some jerk's medal
Who happens to be the color That killed your ancestors
A first paycheck Two police uniforms
Three kids in the backseat Same color as the four Racionais
Five lives interrupted Gold and bronze boys
Gunshots The boy was shot 111 times
The shooter wore a uniform
Ismália
The accuser wasn't even there
-Black people disunited -Ismália
The sharp vision of those Who have it all But color in a world Where it matters the most
But color in a world Where it matters the most
When Ismália went mad,
she got up the tower to dream.
She saw the moon in the sky,
another moon in the sea.
In the dream where she got lost,
she bathed in moonlight.
She wanted to touch the sky,
she wanted to dive in the sea.
In her folly, in the tower, she began to sing.
Close to the sky,
far from the sea,
as an angel she spread her wings to fly.
She wanted the moon from the sky,
she wanted the moon from the sea.
The wings God gave her,
they fluttered wide.
Her soul flew to the sky,
her body went down to the sea.
I looked in the mirror Icarus stared back at me
"Be careful Don’t fly too close to the sun
They can’t handle you free Imagine as a king"
Vultures wanna see you high To say, "I told you so”
In the end, we're all Ismália
Ismália Ismália
Wanted to touch the sky Ended up on the ground
Dark skin is
Ismália Ismália
Ismália
Wanted to touch the sky Ended up on the ground
Opera House, my friend, Jamah!
We're bigger
We just have to dream to carry on
It was an uncomfortable room Dirty like a Komodo dragon
Damp, me, the man of the house at six
Moldy TV corner A scam, ready for the sludge
Naive, damn, we’re kings, bro
Eyes like electrodes Focused, at the top, I defeat crows
A graveyard of dreams Thanks to the law, plans
I switch the game, sell, steal Had a price on my head
Naive, I gathered smiles And said, "Let's go!"
It's a new era for the new At the wind's mercy
I walk through our sovereign soil
Ending the pain, painkiller vibes
We're the light of the Lord Believe it
We're building, not assuming I believe, put my hand on it
Amid the darkness Done, we got it right
Our calm smile is the poison today
Opera House, sing your heart out, like this!
Those who come from where I come from
Sometimes can't find a reason to carry on
So, rise and walk
Go ahead, rise and walk
But I know dreams Will bring what makes you
It's what makes you!
Carry on
So, rise and walk
Go ahead, rise and walk
Go ahead, rise and walk, yo!
We're bigger
We just have to dream to carry on
I know, it's exhausting
What runs out at the end of the month Our money or our hope?
Delirium is the balance
Between our martyrdom and our faith
It was shitty to look For scraps on the debris
Black tarp stretched Hoe over the shoulder and nothing
Recreates itself
With a hurt soul And pans all empty
Brother, filthy dream
Only water left in the fridge And I try to save the world
Like a David Blaine trick Mothers stay, fathers disappear
Usually, at best, a last name
I'm a poser's nightmare
Playboys know Marx, we know hunger
So, clench your fists, smile
Never go back to your hood With an empty mind and hands
Those who come from where I come from
Sometimes can't find a reason to carry on
So, rise and walk
Go ahead, rise and walk
But I know dreams Will bring what makes you
It's what makes you!
Carry on
So, rise and walk
Go ahead, rise and walk Go ahead
Sing along, Opera House!
We're bigger
We just have to dream to carry on
Cast all our demons away, sing along!
We're bigger
We just have to dream to carry on
Louder! Go?
We're bigger
We just have to dream to carry on
The first time I went to Africa…
my friend Chapa took me to Angola's National Museum of Slavery.
There, I found a basin,
and the text on the wall read,
"This basin was used to christen Black people,
and because of a twisted Christian idea,
they were led to believe they had no soul."
I looked over at my friend and, on that day, I realized my mission.
My mission, every time I grab a pen or a mic,
is to return the souls of each brother and sister
who ever thought they had none.
With the sweet scent of rue I think about a calm Buddha
I’m tense, I seek help Sometimes I think of a psalm
It clears my vision from illusions Like an eye doctor
I, the one who sees beyond For myself, for you, ubuntu, uplifting
If I must put my faith in something Gonna rely on what I see
In sum, it's small, tiny Mundane, filthy, hell, and poison
Cold, winter, drizzle Repression and regression
Calm's a luxury, life scalds you Try to read souls beyond the pressure
Got it?
Nations go downhill in the hands Of a Barabbas, where miracles lie
It proves books are crucial To face the damage a saber does
Buried in pressing debt Clueless about God-sent gifts
These days, the only thing That is still free
Are our tears
I came to kill like a heart attack And be born again in childbirth
I rebuild myself, fed up, discarded Down-to-earth, ordinary man
If I'm blessed, I'll share Break into cells, living rooms, bedrooms
I traveled the world, now I know The world is one
And all All we have is ourselves
All we have is
All we have is ourselves
Raise your voice, Opera House. Sing with us!
And all we have is ourselves
All we have is
All we have is ourselves
All we have is
Silence the tiredness Make amends
Offer a warm embrace
Music is only a seed
A smile remains our only common language
Silence the tiredness Make amends
Offer a warm embrace
Music is only a seed
A smile remains our only common language
Uncle, people must be kind.
Like a sunflower, my eyes seek the sun
Believing hate is the solution Is like being a fishhook sommelier
Boat adrift, no lighthouse No sign of northern lights
My voice cuts the night Like a nightingale
Bringing love to the room
All that beats are drums And every drum comes from there
If the heart is the Lord Everything is Africa
I put this tactic to practice Math, you know?
Say what, bro?
While the earth isn't free I'm not free either
As an ancestor of those to come, I will
As an ancestor of those to come, I will Sing with the girls while love grows
It’s empirical, kinda oneiric Kinda Kirikou, my spirit
Want me to take away your pain
A battle of a thousand volts A dagger tearing forcefully
God, why is life so bitter In the land of sugar cane?
This burden frustrates the hood Being a suspect is choking and terrifying
Recharging, like Jesus Toward the light, everyone's Black
Therefore, love!
C'mon, time is king Life is now, there is no later
A temple of peace Like a safe haven amid bad weather
One-two Away from the playboys
As monks, the source like suns In the front, strong as we are
Remember, we're the streets
And all we have is ourselves
All we have is ourselves
Everything, brother, absolutely all we have.
All we have is this, each other.
Thank you, Opera House!
Life goes by in the blink of an eye.
Do I have enough time left to live?
I don’t know, I cannot know.
Who holds the future in their hands?
There's no adding extra time to each season.
What if it's all in vain? Trivial? For no reason?
Yeah. It could be, if it wasn't for love.
Love cherishes with affection, breathes in the other, creates a bond.
In color association, they say yellow is the color of love.
Certainty before the unknown,
rescue when you're against the flow,
as simple as a grain of sand,
it puzzles the mighty at every moment.
Love is a decision, an attitude, much more than a feeling.
Enlivenment, bonfire at dawn, love forgives the unforgivable.
It restores our dignity. It’s spiritual.
Both bodily and heavenly,
it’s not within dogmas, or trapped in religions.
It’s as old as eternity.
Love is spirituality.
Latent, potent, Black, poetry, a shoulder in the quiet night,
a cozy lap to start the day.
Son, hug your mother, Father, forgive your son.
Peace is reparation, fruits of peace,
peace isn't built with weapons.
But I face my weaknesses head on,
I don't have a sheltering bubble,
I wish I could protect all that I love in the castle of my imagination.
But life goes by in the blink of an eye.
Do I have enough time left to live?
I don’t know, I cannot know.
But while there’s love, I'll change the path of my life.
I’ll build an altar where I’ll be one with all,
until I see the ubuntu of emancipation,
as I've found out the secret that makes me human.
The bond is no longer lost.
Love is the ultimate secret, and I paint it all yellow.
All we have is ourselves
All we have is
All we have is ourselves
All we have is
All we have is ourselves
All we have is
All we have is ourselves
All we have is
All we have is ourselves
All we have is
All we have is ourselves
All we have is
All we have is ourselves
All we have is
All we have is ourselves
All we have is
Thanks, São Paulo. Thanks, Opera House!
What a historic night!
MY LIFE
As if I wouldn't make room for this one, man?
This is for my granny. First time here in 80 years.
Posers only talk the talk
But the whole world can see
Wherever we are, wherever we go
We'll always be ghetto
Posers only talk the talk
But the whole world can see
Wherever we are, wherever we go
We'll always be ghetto
Gossip everywhere
On the street, greetings Adoniran's "Saudosa Maloca"
Sing about life, bring in money Bad luck, shine, focus
Scare away the sons of… Intrigues of those low lives
Get dressed, smile, and settle
Make some money only to prove That money means shit
It's for the art, not for a prize
Crush the high society, play the part
Clap your hands! Like this!
Do we want big cars and mansions, bro? Why not?
Like a boss on a plane? Why not?
Want some options, salmon, bro? Why not?
Being happy, damn, say it, why not?
Together during bad times For God's sake, amen, just a phase
Today, cooling the mind
Getting the ships ready
Mind blowing ideas, light speed Like a projectile, man
Go wild, ain't no explosion big enough
And the striped polo shirts
Bizarre
-Black shades -Bang!
Bling on sight
I came to make it clear that I'm Black
A rare treasure in a tough game
But I'm out there, I sing for my saints
Those vermin shaking harder Than with Gaby Amarantos' Tecnobrega
Black pride, our smile is an insult
We are neither better nor worse
It's none of your business
Posers only talk the talk Only talk!
But the whole world can see
Wherever we are, wherever we go
We'll always be ghetto
Posers only talk the talk
But the whole world can see
Wherever we are, wherever we go
We'll always be ghetto
On the bass, ladies and gentlemen, Julio Fejuca.
Like that!
Ghetto!
Ghetto!
Ghetto!
Ghetto!
Enemy tribes Armies and borders
Wars, fights, hoods Endless streets turning into trenches
And if they cross us
We'll make them pay
An eye for an eye A tooth for a tooth
Go!
It's going south
South
South
South, it's going south
South
South
South, it's going south
Troublemaker kids made a big scene
Hit a motorcycle, crashed into cars Picked a fight with old ladies and left
Hey! It's a party, peace
Some dudes just drink too much
Try to prove they're man enough End up dead covered in newspapers
The girls dancing Suddenly gunshots
Just like a cockfight Cops all over disturbing the hood
Grey rats stepping on our toes, bro, yeah
I know, I'm not here to play the lawyer
If they're eager to cross us It'll turn sour
It's tricky
So, well-deserved, bro
Many are the sons of…
Should serve as an example indeed For others to follow procedure
So, what's it gonna be? Tell me
Going overboard with the kids
It's always the same story for us Feels like it's never ending
A hood's a hood, many battles, brother
We all pull our own weight Gonna tell you, they gotta learn
Some dudes just won't listen
So, you're right, bro But just listen to this
When in this story We weren't the ones killing our own?
So, enemy tribes Armies and borders
Wars, fights, hoods Endless streets turning into trenches
If they cross us
We make'em pay
Now let's shake the Opera House, okay?
An eye for an eye
Go!

Good night, ladies and gentlemen!
That's it, now give it up to my brothers and sisters here on stage.
Saxophone, flute, Bugão!
Trombone, Allan!
Trumpet, Larissa!
Voice, Thiago Jamelão!
Drums, percussion, and whatever else you want, Sivuca!
Turntable… Wait. Silence.
You’re all too far away to smell DJ Nyack’s cologne.
On top of that, he is a great DJ.
DJ Nyack!
Voice, Jamah!
Guitar and voice, Michelle!
Bass, conductor, our maestro, Julio Fejuca.
My name is Emicida.
I humbly think we've made history on this incredible day.
One, two.
One, two, three, and…
Hey, emoriô
Hey, emoriô
Hey, emoriô
Hey, emoriô
Hey, emoriô
Thank you very much, São Paulo!
Thank you so much, Opera House!
We are the streets!
I love you all, man. I'm crying.
Emoriô must be a Nago word
Be careful on the trapeze
Even if desperate modern times Weigh us down
A thumbs up for hate, man In that case
Soon common sense will say "Take a deep breath"
You gotta learn Blackboard and chalk
Let your spirit rest Pray and get back 100%
Shut the world off Think about how life is worth
Be the light on a cloudy day
And she said "May God be with you, boo, good day"
Kissed me, turned it into poetry
"May God be with you, boo"
A glimpse of pure love Bursting with happiness
"May God be with you, boo"
Come back to us Like a soccer player after scoring a goal
Full heart, sparkling eyes
That's what family's about My soul said, "About time"
I will face whatever comes for her
Face the struggles For the little joys of adulthood
I will
I will go to battle like a warrior
Even if I have to take on The entire planet
Run a marathon, get first place And shout, "It's all for you, babe"
I will face whatever comes for her
Face the struggles For the little joys of adulthood
I will
I will go to battle like a warrior
Even if I have to take on The entire planet
Run a marathon, get first place And shout, "It's all for you, babe"
A peaceful Saturday You can sleep in
The goal of the match To avoid relegation
Long weekend on the beach
Find a Tupperware With the matching lid
Earlier today Rosemary blossomed quietly
I thought it'd be just crabgrass
She complains it's sour Gathers all the toys
Victory to me Is a positive report card
Diapers on sale at the drugstore
Extra money from overtime at work
Gifts in watercolor and tissue paper Make my day
I guess God's dreams Might be something like that
I will face whatever comes for her
Face the struggles For the little joys of adulthood
I will
I will go to battle like a warrior
Even if I have to take on The entire planet
Run a marathon, get first place And shout, "It's all for you, babe"
I will face whatever comes for her
Face the struggles For the little joys of adulthood
I will
I will go to battle like a warrior
Even if I have to take on The entire planet
Run a marathon, get first place And shout, "It's all for you, babe"
Hey, Leandro,
I'm gonna tell you this 'cause I know it'll make you laugh.
I went to Taboão da Serra to visit my mother.
Just chilling, our hood, all good.
I met the bros, then one of them told me this story.
He said he was smoking a cigarette on the terrace.
Four-story crib, you know?
When he looks down at the street,
there's a guy trying to break into his car
to steal the stereo.
Like when they break in to steal it.
Upstairs, he goes, "What now?"
He finds a huge rock sitting there, this big thing, you know?
He says, "That's it. I'm gonna aim for the head."
Man, check this out.
He aims for the guy, but hits the roof of his car instead!
He wrecked the whole car, man!
He tried to save his car and ended up fucking it all up.
And there's more. The impact of the rock opened the door
that the guy couldn't get open.
So he stole the stereo and ran away!
Lot of animals can do it.
I'm not just talking about animals you never heard the name of before.
Insects, amphibians, even house cats can do it--
-Get the fuck outta here. -It's true, look it up.
House cats have this parasite called toxoplasmosis. You know what it does?
It makes field mice not scared of cats anymore.
[Gerry] Why would the cats want that?
So they can eat 'em.
Field mice isn't scared of cats, it walks right up to it and presents itself like lunch.
It's meals on fuckin' wheels. -That's not true. -[Dale] It is true.
It's not fucking true.
It is fucking true and it's not just field mice that they're infecting. They're infecting human beings.
Every human being on the fucking planet that has a cat. It's true.
What's better than a dozen dead field mice? It's one brainwashed human being
that's bringing you Fancy Feast every five minutes.
That's why Carol Baker has these dozen fucking cats in her house.
-No shit. -[Dale] Yeah.
I knew she was crazy.
[Dale] She's nuts, man. Leave Carol Baker out of this, all right? She's a nice old lady.
Leave Carol Baker out of this, all right? She's a nice old lady. She just misses her husband.
No. Carol Baker's not even Carol Baker anymore.
Now she's a slave to her cat overlords.
[Harry] This is the worst week of the year. All the college girls leave
and all I'm left with are you... fucking crazies.
[Dale] Yeah, go buy a cat, see what happens. Where are you going? Can you give me a ride?
[Harry] I've gotta get home, Dale. It's on your way!
Bye, Gerry!
It's the same thing that happened with the Palatine a hundred fucking years ago, man.
That ship didn't get raided by pirates and sink.
No, no... a fucking sea creature came out of the depths and infected all the crew with a parasite
and infected all the crew with a parasite that made 'em go crazy and jump overboard, so it could eat 'em.
Everybody knows that. Symbiotic. Codependent. And now the government is harnessing
Symbiotic. Codependent. And now the government is harnessing the power of the parasites and putting it in the vaccines with our kids--
the power of the parasites and putting it in the vaccines with our kids-- What are you doing?
-Unbuckling your seat belt. -Why?
So when I drive into that telephone pole, you're gonna shoot through the windshield and then I'll never have to hear about
you're gonna shoot through the windshield and then I'll never have to hear about fucking chemtrails, and 9/11, and mind control,
and fucking lizard people again.
That's fucked up...
I don't believe in lizard people.
-[Harry] Holy shit! -[tires screeching]
It's still alive.
Where the fuck did that come from?
What are you doing?
Put it out of its misery...
You want me to hit it with a rock? Yeah, it's a kindness. That's what you do.
It's dead.
Are you sure?
[Harry] Get in the car.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad.
Dad!
What are you doing out here?
Dog's barking...
Look, I don't want to catch you sleepwalking again, Dad.
-[Tom] All right, all right... -No more caffeine.
All right, all right, I'm going to sleep.
Yeah, well sooner or later you're gonna be sleep-driving and you're gonna be sleep-crashing. Yeah.
What are you gonna start singing lullabies now?
Don't let the bed bugs bite. [laughing] Get the fuck outta here.
[Audry] Yeah, today is kinda tricky for me, can Paul go on his own?
[man] Chief Rogers requested you by name. I'm sure he did.
Listen, it's gonna be a whole thing with school...
-Mom. -...and I'm gonna have to drop in -on my dad and brother... -Mom?
...on the island, and, look, I'm sorry, I've just got a lot on my plate right now.
[man] Look, I think this could be a legitimate problem we have on our hands. Just don't tell your family you'll be on the island.
Yeah, that's not really how it works. Block Island is a small place.
Mom, I don't want toast.
-Well, what do you want? -[Emily] Fruity Pebbles.
-We're out of milk. -We've been out of milk all week.
Emily, it's either toast or cereal with water.
-Mom! -[man] Audry?
Yeah, sorry. Sorry, listen, Paul is perfectly capable,
he'll be fine to go without me. [man] Audry, everybody's got family problems.
I don't want to argue with you over an assignment, okay?
Yeah.
[man] There's a ferry at 7:30, make sure you're on it.
Wanna go on a field trip?
[Paul] Hey, hey! Look who gets to play hooky! Can you say hi to Paul?
Hi, Emily.
Must be nice having an excuse to make a trip back home...
[Audry] Yeah...
You get back often? Uh, less and less since my mom died.
My brother is just kinda, I don't know...
An asshole?
Emily... let's just not say that to Uncle Harry's face, okay?
Dad!
Dad?
Lynch boathouse to Patty M. Do you copy? Over.
Dad, it's Harry. Where are you? Over.
The house is burning down...
Dad! Wake up!
[voice over radio] Sir, this line is for operational use only.
All right, keep your skirt on.
[Audry] My brother's not an asshole.
It was just tough after my mom died.
Harry just... he has a temper.
Where were you?
I took the boat out this morning.
This morning, or last night?
Dad.
Can you tie off the other end, or are you gonna make me do it myself?
Can you remember?
-[phone vibrating] -Was it dark out when you left?
-Hello? -[Audry] Hey, Dad.
I'm on the island. Mind if I crash at the place for a couple nights?
Oh, no, that's great!
You got Emily with ya?
[Rogers] The island is a totally different beast this time of year.
About 15 to 20 thousand folks over the summer,
and just a thousand all year long.
-That's rounding up... -Yeah maybe...
So, what's going on down at West Beach?
Well... we got a bit of a fish problem.
Tons of dead ones were rolling up on the shore.
[Audry] How many?
Hard to tell. Maybe nine or ten?
Nine or ten what? Fish?
Tons. Nine or ten tons.
[Audry] When did this happen, yesterday?
Well, uh, you know, not all at once.
It's rancid.
Emily, don't touch that.
Come here.
What does that mean, not all at once? Every few days a new batch rolls up.
Bill Ryan pulled in a whole net of them on Saturday.
Anna Miller and her kid found 'em, what, three weeks ago?
You remember Anna? She's got a kid now.
[Harry] Well, I'm glad you guys are finally cleaning up that mess.
The whole west side of the island smells like taint.
What's taint?
-"Taint none of your business." -Harry.
So what do you think's been killing 'em? [Paul] Could be hypoxia.
No, what's that?
It's basically when too many fish are in a certain area
they can deplete the oxygen in the water too fast...
[Tom] So, what? They drown?
-Kinda, yeah... -They suffocate.
Fish suffocating. That's a trip.
[Paul] Yeah, right? It happens.
So where's the EPA putting you tonight? Somewhere swank?
Oh, no, I'm just gonna be taking the ferry back and forth.
Oh, that's crazy. You should stay here with us.
-Oh, that's okay-- -No, come on. We've got plenty of room.
-You and Audry can take the queen. -Dad!
-Jesus Christ... -[Tom] What?
I'm just gonna, uh... use the rest room.
-[Audry] Are you kidding me? -What?
He works for me. I'm his boss. Yeah, Dad. That's weird.
-Oh give me a break. -It's totally inappropriate.
I just think that Emily should have a father figure in her life.
Dad...
[Tom] Hey, Paul, let me give you a lift to the ferry!
-[Harry] No! -I'm gonna take him.
Do you mind keeping an eye on Emily?
[Emily] What about those ones?
[Harry] No, those are too small.
Here, this stuff... this stuff is like crack to fish.
What's crack?
It's like cocaine, but you can smoke it.
Now you gotta be patient until you see some fish...
What about those ones?
Where?
There.
Yeah, uh, maybe this wasn't such a good idea--
What's wrong with them? You know what? Why don't we go try to catch some frogs in the marsh?
You know what? Why don't we go try to catch some frogs in the marsh?
Okay.
Well, I guess that's the last coworker of mine you'll ever meet.
Dad?
Dad, I think it's full.
Can I get ya something?
You okay?
You bet.
[Audry] Hey, what's going on with Dad?
What do you mean?
I just caught him drifting off, all spaced out.
He's fine.
[Audry] It was weird.
I'm taking care of him, Audry. I'm not accusing you of anything, I'm just--
[Harry] He's getting older.
You might notice that if you came by a little more often.
Okay. Sorry. Didn't mean anything by it.
Dad's good.
[Audry] You brush your teeth?
Yeah.
If you need me, I'm right down the hall, okay?
Okay.
And if you get cold you have a sweater in your backpack... Wait!
What's this?
[Emily] Nothing.
Where did you get this?
Uncle Harry said I could keep him.
[Audry] Oh, he did, did he?
Don't you think this frog is gonna miss his family?
[Emily] Uncle Harry said you take animals from the water all the time.
That's different. Most of them go back in the ocean.
[Emily] But not all of them.
Almost.
Some of them die.
Are you thinking about the fish we saw on the beach?
I know it's confusing.
But most of the fish we take out of the water we put right back in just a few days later.
We're learning about them.
We're studying them so we can get to know them better.
So we can help them better.
But how are you helping them if some of them end up dead?
I know it sounds mean and scary...
but by taking some brave fish out of the water and learning about them,
we can eventually help all the other fish.
It's a good thing we're doing.
I just want to learn about him.
We'll see.
Hey, what's going on?
I think she had a nightmare.
Hey, are you okay?
What happened?
You okay, sweetheart?
Maybe she had a nightmare... she fell out of bed?
Is she okay?
What the hell was that?
She probably had a nightmare. She woke up in a strange place--
She probably had a nightmare. She woke up in a strange place-- No, no, something's wrong with Dad.
What was he doing in there?
What do you think happened?
I don't know, but he really scared her.
How much did he drink tonight?
He didn't do anything.
Listen, we're gonna take the first ferry out tomorrow morning.
Audry, you're overreacting. She had a nightmare. It's not a big deal.
It doesn't make sense for her to be here while I work anyway, so we're just gonna go.
It'll kill him if you take off first thing.
Just stay for breakfast, okay?
He's not some monster.
[Emily] Mom?
Yeah, I'm coming, Em...
See you in the morning.
[Harry] What are you doing?
We're heading out.
Audry, stay for breakfast. [Audry] The ferry leaves at eight, if we miss it, the next one's not 'til noon.
[Audry] The ferry leaves at eight, if we miss it, the next one's not 'til noon.
How'd he take it?
He's not up yet.
He's not?
His door's still shut. [Harry] Shit.
-What? -He's gone.
Lynch house to the Patty M. Do you copy?
He was hammered last night, he's gonna get himself killed out there.
Lynch house to the Patty M. Do you copy? Over.
[Audry] He's not responding.
Sometimes he goes out in the morning to fish.
[Emily] I saw him leave last night.
Are you sure it was last night?
It was dark out.
He's over there!
Where? Down by West Beach!
Dad?
-[Audry] Dad! -Dad, you okay? Shit.
Is he down there?
The place is fucking ransacked!
The fuck is that noise?
Radio's shot.
Jesus Christ, what the hell happened to him?
[Audry] Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Man overboard, and missing.
Our position is 41.12 North.
71.52 West.
It's a 22 foot... [dialogue fades]
[Rogers] I think we got everything we need, guys.
You know, if he was wearing a life jacket,
there's a chance the Coast Guard will find him...
but it's important to be prepared for the worst.
This time of year, someone your dad's age...
every hour that goes by, the odds get worse.
That's it?
[Rogers] It's in the Coast Guard's hands, we'll keep you up to speed.
Wait, so no one's coming from the mainland
to take crime scene photos or take evidence, or... anything like that?
It's not really necessary in this case.
There's no reason to believe there was foul play.
[Harry] Are you kidding?
Harry... if he had a few drinks, hit a little rough water--
He wasn't drunk.
[Rogers] Even sober, big enough waves-- -Are you fucking kidding me? -Harry.
-Are you fucking kidding me? -Harry.
The place was ransacked. Somebody did this.
Nothing was taken. His poles are still here, that new radio...
[Harry] The radio's busted.
Not when we checked.
We're doing all we can, Harry, I promise.
But I know your dad.
This isn't the first time he had an accident drinking on his boat alone.
I'm sorry, guys. I really am.
Tom was a good guy.
They'll keep searching 'til morning.
This island ain't made of of fuckin' saints, ya know that?
Stop it. We're not going to get anywhere with you flying off the handle.
They don't even give a shit, Audry. They're not going to do anything.
They're glorified beach patrol.
[Paul] You okay?
I don't know.
They searched the whole coast and he's not out there...
How's Harry taking it?
He thinks someone attacked him.
I think it's just how he copes with something overwhelming.
He wanted to sue the hospital when my mom died.
She smoked two packs a day, got lung cancer,
and Harry wanted to sue her doctor.
He gets paranoid.
He just refuses to believe the most obvious, simple answer is right.
My dad drank too much...
and it finally caught up to him.
Hey, Harry! I brought you food.
Look at this.
You've gotta hit someone pretty hard to break one of these.
It just doesn't make any sense. We gotta hire a private investigator.
We gotta get divers out there to check out the area.
-Something happened to him. -What do you expect to find?
It's been almost 24 hours... I know it's hard--
It's been almost 24 hours... I know it's hard-- No.
I'm not giving up on him.
Don't do this to yourself.
[Paul] What are you doing here? Figured I could come help.
No, you don't have to do that.
It's a good distraction.
[Paul] How's Emily doing?
She's confused.
I don't think she really gets it. [Paul] Yeah...
Your brother stopped by the office this morning, he seemed pretty out of it.
Harry? Why? He wanted to borrow some gear.
What gear?
Scuba equipment?
Jesus Christ. I'm sorry. I thought you knew.
It's been 36 hours.
I mean, if the Coast Guard can't find him, what's Harry gonna do?
Ah, fuck!
What's up?
Hey, you all right?
Yeah.
I'm worried about you. Audry, I'm fine.
[Audry] Jen's coming in a few days.
Why? She hasn't even seen Dad in like two years.
She wants to help.
She thinks we need to start getting Dad's affairs in order.
Give me a fucking break. I'm sorry, Harry. I'm upset too.
I'm sorry, Harry. I'm upset too.
But we've got to work on the next steps.
We can't be going crazy, or...
I don't know...
I just don't want to see you go off the deep end again.
We don't even know what happened yet. I'm not gonna bury an empty box.
[coroner] We're ready for you.
That's him.
[coroner] Do you need a minute alone?
How did this happen?
We're still figuring that out.
-[Audry] We don't need to do this now. -[Harry] No, I want to know.
All the bruises and shit on his face... what did that to him?
[coroner] There is some head trauma... and lacerations on his face and body,
which could have been caused by rocks in the water. It's hard to say.
What do you mean, "hard to say"?
Head trauma can be pretty tricky.
The head often times gets bumped around in the water and bleeds whether or not the person is, um...
alive or dead.
So, uh... rocks?
He just-- He bumped into some rocks?
[coroner] There's no way of knowing, really.
[Gerry] Hey, man.
It's really fucked up what happened to your dad.
-I can't believe... -I really don't wanna talk about it.
Hey, you should talk to Dale. He knows what's going on--
-I don't want to talk to Dale. -No, hey, Dale! Dale!
-[Dale] Huh? -Fuck...
Hey, Harry! Hold on. Thank you. Hey, Harry, hold on. Stay right there. Hold on.
I gotta talk to you about something. Hold on.
Hey, I've gotta get out of here, man. I owe you that fifty bucks... [indistinct rambling]
Hey, Harry, I've gotta talk to you about something real quick.
Ah, shit, Dale, you know, I'm just on my way out.
No, It's about your dad, I think I'm on to something. Hey, can I get a ride? Fuck.
How you holding up?
Not great.
Lot of strange activity lately, man.
You hear about all them dead fish?
What about Andy Gould's catch a few weeks back?
Dead fish?
Birds... couple dozen of them.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. Same thing happened in Arkansas about three years ago.
Five thousand birds dropped out of the sky, dead.
Nobody knew what happened to 'em.
Where'd you read this?
You wanna know the weirdest thing?
Apparently they died before they hit the ground.
Like there was some kind of physical trauma in the air.
-Where did you read this shit? -It happened!
In The Journal, Times,
about a billion websites, man. Look it up! Shit.
It's happening all over.
Not just Arkansas, not just here either.
Not just Arkansas, not just here either. Sweden, Norway, Germany, Brazil...
Did your buddy report those dead birds?
To who? The government?
Risk getting put on some fuckin' list for the rest of his life? Are you kidding me?
It's probably the government that's doing this shit anyway.
You and I should sit down sometime and talk. Honestly.
It's all connected.
Dead birds in the water. Dead fish in the water.
Your dad in the water.
Talk soon.
Ugh...
[Audry] I think we should give Harry the house...
[Jen] Jesus, Audry. He can move.
Seriously. He can get a one bedroom apartment in Cranston for 800 bucks.
[Audry] He's not going to know anyone. [Jen] You think he knows anyone here?
He knew Dad. Period.
It's all millionaires during the summer, yokels and crazy people all year round.
[Audry] What's he going to do on the mainland?
Flip burgers, mop floors. What's he going to do here?
Would you rather him spend the winter rattling around Dad's house
and drinking himself to death?
Harry's an adult, and has to start acting like one.
-[Jen] Hey, Har... -Hi.
[Jen] How you holding up?
So... how are plans coming along?
We're gonna do the collation at McCabe's...
I'm sure Dad would be buried there if they let him.
They don't have a kitchen, so... one of us will have to go to the store and pick up some food.
I wouldn't be surprised if half the island shows up.
[Jen] Man, I'm gonna need a stiff drink after that...
You know, we're not all crazy around here.
[Jen] What?
I-- I know that.
I'm so sorry.
-[growling continues] -[woman] You must be Harry.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
I work with Jen.
Okay. She said you worked with your dad,
-you two must have-- -I have to go.
[Dale] How you holding up?
I'm going out of my mind.
I gotta make small talk with a bunch of fucking people I don't even know.
Make them feel better because they met my dad a couple times.
He's my fucking dad.
Who the fuck are these people?
[Dale] Why the closed casket?
[Harry] Wasn't my decision.
Yeah, so the mortician was telling me that your dad came in
and he wasn't looking all right?
Like something might've happened to him out there...
Either way... sorry for your loss, man.
What can I get for you? Do you have any platters?
[deli clerk] What'd you have in mind?
Uh... ham? Cheese?
[deli clerk] Give me a sec.
[deli clerk's voice echoes] How much ham do you want?
Sir?
How much do you want?
All of it.
[distorted] What are you feeding? The whole orphanage?
Hey, buddy! Where are you going?
You've got to pay for that.
What the hell, man?
Come on.
What's your problem?
I'm sorry.
[worker] Where are you going? You can't just leave this here. Come on. Are you kidding me? Hey...
Where are you going?
What's going on? Where's the food?
-I don't have it. -Are you kidding me?
You got any Advil back there?
[bartender] Headache?
I don't know, something like that.
Can I get a shot with it?
Can I get another one?
[Audry] Where's the food? People are starving.
[Jen] He didn't get it. I don't know what the hell is going on with him.
He acts like he's the only person who's affected here.
[Ned] Nobody had no reason to hurt him. I mean, it was just a freak accident.
[Steve] No reason? He's got that big ole house with the view. It's got to be worth at least a couple million these days.
You're telling me Harry had nothing to gain from this?
That's right, I'm talking about you, you piece of shit.
What are you saying? What's it like living in that house all by yourself?
Why don't you shut your fucking mouth, Steve.
Your pa gave you everything, and you throw him in the water like a fucking stone.
What's going on?
[Harry] Get the fuck off of me!
You calm?
-Come on, Harry. -[Harry] Yeah.
All right.
Steve wanted to press charges, but I talked to him.
Oh, come on. You should've heard that old shit--
All right, Harry. It's settled.
Now, you've gotta call Ned and apologize.
You nearly broke the guy's nose.
Fine.
Your sister's out front.
Which one?
The nice one.
[officer] Couldn't find an ashtray?
Be good!
It's not my fault. -It was Dad's funeral, Harry. -He started it.
It was Dad's funeral.
I'm sorry.
Meredith Gibson invited us over for dinner tonight.
[Harry] Okay.
You can come, but you have to behave yourself.
-Oh, give me a break, Audry. -Jen didn't even want you to be there.
Then I won't fucking go. I don't blame her.
She's upset.
Steve accused me of killing Dad.
What?
He said I wanted the house.
He said that?
Some guys deserve a black eye every once in a while.
[Audry] Jesus...
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me too.
What the fuck, Harry?
What's going on?
The place is a mess, how much did you drink last night?
I didn't.
Most people throw their beer bottles in the trash...
-I didn't fucking do anything! -...not smash it on the floor.
This was Mom and Dad's house, okay? It's not a dump!
When is she going back to New York?
Tonight.
Thank Christ.
She gets to be pissed off when you pull shit like this.
Yeah, okay.
Ya know, before Mom died,
she told me she spent her whole life trying to help us get along.
She begged me not to let it all fall apart after she was gone.
Stop picking fights with Jen.
Hey, guys! Over here!
[girl] There's like thirty of 'em.
[boy] All their heads were, like, smashed in.
Jeez.
[Jen] Your grandpa let your Uncle Harry get away with anything.
When I was having a bad day at school,
he'd come and he'd take me out, Grandma had no clue.
[Audry] Don't get any ideas...
Uncle Harry's lucky he was the favorite.
Grandpa never did that with me.
You would've ratted him out.
Where would you go?
We would just jump on the boat and cruise around the coast.
Sometimes we'd go exploring.
Sakonnet, Nantucket...
Hey, we should get going if you're gonna make that ferry.
-Okay. -You need a lift?
-I can take her. -I don't mind.
Um... okay.
Listen, I, uh...
I'm sorry that things have been...
weird or whatever between us.
I just... I haven't been myself.
He was my best friend, ya know? And, uh, I didn't have many friends growing up,
I don't have many now.
So he was all I had.
I'm sorry too.
But we all just want what's best for you.
Yeah.
[Jen] Especially Audry...
Don't take advantage of her, okay? She's got her own kid to worry about.
Yeah, you should probably get going.
I love you, Harry.
It's just... It's time to take control of your life.
Take care of yourself.
See you soon?
Yeah, I'll see you at the next funeral.
Deer.
Deer.
Deer.
Deer.
Deer.
Deer.
Yeah?
You want to tell me what happened to your truck?
Hey, what's going on?
[officer] Harry's truck's all smashed up. There's blood on the grille.
Jesus. What'd you hit?
[Harry] I don't-- A deer.
How many beers did you have last night, Harry? I wasn't drunk.
If I find you tooling around and drinking in that thing,
I'm going to take you to the ACI myself, you understand?
I don't care that you're going through a rough time because your father's dead--
-Okay, take it easy... -I'm not gonna let you kill someone
-in that truck. -Loud and clear. Anything else?
You better keep an eye on him.
Why didn't you tell me you hit a deer, Harry?
I don't remember what happened.
-[Audry] Were you drunk? -No.
-[Audry] Harry. -No...
I wasn't.
I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.
Tell me what's going on.
It's all my fault. It's all my fucking fault.
He was losing his mind.
I don't know if it was dementia.
I don't know if he was just going fucking crazy or what,
but he'd be so confused, he'd just black out.
And then I tried to get him to go to the doctor, but he wouldn't do it.
And then he wouldn't let me tell anybody.
[Audry] It's okay, Harry. It's not your fault. Audry, nobody knew.
And then he gets on the fucking boat and he drowns.
So, yeah. I should've done something. I should've told somebody.
Stop... stop.
It's happening to me, Audry.
I'm blacking out.
[sighs] I'm getting confused.
I lose minutes, I lose hours...
Are you forgetting things?
I was driving home last night, and I see this fucking deer...
and then I wake up and I'm on the boat, in the middle of the fucking sound.
You're sleepwalking.
I'm scared.
[nurse] I need you to memorize these three words:
potato, dumpling, porcupine.
What?
Potato, dumpling, porcupine.
Can you memorize those?
What am I four years old?
Just keep those in your head.
Now, draw a clock inside the circle.
Okay.
[nurse] That's very good.
Yeah, well, I'm not an idiot, so...
Can you repeat those three words for me?
Is this a test to see if I'm crazy?
It's a little tight in here.
[MRI tech] Hold still please.
Hey! Get me out of here!
Hey, get me the fuck out of here! Get me out of here!
Get me out of here!
[Dr. Koch] Are you all right?
Have you calmed down?
It was like being microwaved in a coffin in there.
[Dr. Koch] It says here that you've been getting headaches?
Did you get them in the MRI?
I couldn't even think.
You live near the west bank of Block Island, right?
Near that new wind farm?
[Harry] Yeah.
I'd like you to talk to a friend of mine. He had similar issues a few years back.
Headaches, fatigue, memory deficits... And what was wrong with him?
It's rare, but I believe that he had electromagnetic hypersensitivity...
It means that your body doesn't respond well to electronic waves.
That they affect your brain. Make you feel sick...
Okay, how do you cure it?
Well, there's not much known about it now, but my friend was able to get relief by getting rid of all of his electronics
but my friend was able to get relief by getting rid of all of his electronics and moving to an area near West Greenwich.
It's a sort of an electromagnetic dead zone.
Uh, yeah, I'm not moving to South County.
I think it'd be a good idea for you to write to him -and see if he has anything to say. -Oh.
-There's a chance that relocating-- -Well, you can forget it. Because, I'm not moving.
They could take down their goddamn turbines, I-- I was here first.
[Audry] Can I get his information?
His phone number or something?
[Dr. Koch] He doesn't have a phone. That's the thing...
Right.
I can give you his address if you'd like to write him a letter.
In the meantime, here's a prescription for something mild.
This should help him with his anxiety.
But no more drinking.
Easier said than done.
He's got to find a better way to cope.
[cashier] Is that it?
I hope she didn't drive you too crazy. [Paul] No, no, she was easy. Where's Harry?
I don't know. It didn't go great. He went on a drive to clear his head.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
No.
I don't know. I don't know what I'm supposed to do right now.
[Paul] You know, I can stay...
if you're, you know, worried about him, or if you're...
afraid he might do something.
[Audry] He's not dangerous.
He just seems a little... unstable.
He's my brother, Paul. He's not violent.
[Paul] People change, Audry.
[Audry] Not like that.
I don't know, something traumatic happens, and it can be like... the flip of a switch. You know? Some underlying condition surfaces.
the flip of a switch. You know? Some underlying condition surfaces.
Look, I'm just saying, you don't have to do everything yourself, okay?
Maybe it's time you consider some serious help.
Like what?
Like, I don't know, they have some really good programs at Madison.
I'm not sending him to a mental institution.
[Paul] Okay, Audry, it's not some kind of insane asylum, okay? It's just full-time care
by people that are trained to deal with someone like him...
Is Uncle Harry crazy?
I don't know.
[Harry] Hello?
Is someone in there?
Hello?
Hey, is somebody in there?
Harry?
What are you doing out here?
Is this your stuff?
Yeah.
Hygrometers, barometers, a Geiger counter, EMF reader, you name it, I got it.
Is this the spot where those birds dropped?
Yeah. Somebody's got to keep an eye on this place.
[Harry] You find anything?
Lotta strange data. It's too soon to speculate though.
What are you doing out here?
I don't know.
Something's wrong with me.
[Dale] What do you mean?
They got me going to all these doctors and all this bullshit.
But something's wrong.
Something with the island. You know it. I know it. I just...
I want to get to the bottom of it.
Come with me.
This place has always been a hotbed of activity, but this is new, man.
I'm glad you're finally involved in all this.
I've been keeping tabs on this island since I was a fucking teenager, man.
Government testing... Paranormal activity, interdimensional communications,
you name it, it's in that fucking file. Here look at this, just some light reading for you. [laughs]
What is all this?
"This" are printouts of every website that I could find... about paranormal activity
before the government could get their hands on it and redact it.
Right.
[Dale] Weird world outside of this garage.
Are you ready for the truth?
Fucking crazy person.
I just bought a six pack.
You gotta go easy on the alcohol, Harry.
-Dr. Koch said-- -I'm going to McCabe's.
[Audry] Harry.
What?
Just go to bed, watch a movie or something.
You'll feel better.
What do you want?
Dog.
Dog.
Dog--
[Tom's distorted voice] Dog.
Dog.
Dog.
Dog.
Dog.
[Audry] I can't keep doing this.
Shit is everywhere.
It rained last night, Harry, everything out there is ruined.
I'm sorry.
[Audry] Did you blackout?
Do you even remember what happened?
I tried to make it stop.
The Petersons' dog went missing last night.
Did you have something to do with that?
I didn't do it.
Are you sure?
Emily's eaten. She knows how to set up her bed.
Just make sure Harry doesn't burn the place down.
Wait, where are you going? I need answers. I can't wait two weeks to get some letter back from this guy.
I need answers. I can't wait two weeks to get some letter back from this guy.
That's crazy, Audry, you don't even know this guy. Just give him a call.
-He doesn't have a phone. -Then I'll go.
No. Paul, I just need you to trust me on this, okay? I need to be the one asking the questions.
[Paul] Listen, just let me go for you.
I don't want to see you get hurt by some crazy guy living in the woods.
You mean too much to me, okay?
I can't have this conversation right now. -Audry. -Listen, if you want to help,
-Audry. -Listen, if you want to help, keep an eye on Emily.
I've got to do this myself.
Okay.
[Audry] I'll be back. Last ferry.
[man] Can I help you?
Are you Kurt?
Who are you?
I'm Audry. Dr. Koch gave me your information.
I was hoping to ask you some questions. [Kurt] Take that off.
I'm sorry, what?
Your watch. Is that a cell phone in your purse?
Yeah.
Put it in your car.
Now!
Okay.
You coming?
Yep.
Walking in here with a cell phone is like walking in here with a grenade.
Don't you get it? I'm sorry, I should've realized.
[Kurt] How's Annie?
Dr. Koch? She's good.
She still in Boston?
Providence.
I think my brother might be suffering from your same affliction.
-Electromagnetic-- -I ain't got that.
No?
I got a problem with electronics though, that's for sure.
I'm just trying to get a better understanding-- You want something stiffer than this?
I'm okay.
[Kurt] Come on.
It ain't often I get company out here.
Listen...
I'm sorry if your brother is getting...
headaches and stuff from his cell phone or whatever, but...
-that ain't what I got. -It's not just headaches.
He's been having blackouts.
He's been doing strange things.
Loses track of time.
When did all this start?
[Paul] All right...
My niece loves this one, Em. I think you're gonna like it.
I'll be in my... room. Well, it's not that bad, I promise.
I just-- I just wanna shut my eyes. [Paul] Come on, man... give it a shot.
Yeah, watch it with us.
[Kurt] Where does he end up?
-What do you mean? -Is he drawn somewhere specifically?
-I really don't know. -What does he do during his blackouts?
I don't know, he makes a mess, trashes the place--
I don't know, he makes a mess, trashes the place-- What does he take? Animals? Food?
What does he take? Animals? Food?
I'm not following you. [Kurt] You've gotta get him away from there.
They start small. Monitoring what we eat, what we interact with.
Pretty soon they want more.
Pretty soon someone's gonna end up hurt.
[Paul] Come on, this DVD's brand new.
Shit.
What's wrong?
[Paul] I don't know, might be like a scratched disk or something.
Girl.
Girl.
They're communicating with him.
They make you hallucinate, see stuff that ain't there.
Force your hand.
Don't you understand? He's their vessel now.
Who?
Them.
Okay...
-I should get going. -No, they want something.
What do they want?
[Tom's distorted voice] Girl.
Girl.
Girl.
-Girl. -What's wrong, Uncle Harry?
Girl.
-Girl. -What's going on?
-I gotta leave. -Girl.
Hey, hey! Harry. Come on, man! You should really stay. You--
Harry!
Listen to me! It's only gonna get worse.
One day I catch myself bringing my cat to a rendezvous.
The next I've got a goddamn homeless lady in the back of my fucking seat!
-Let go of me. -They wanna know what makes us tick, lady.
They're going to rip you apart and staple you back together again.
No! You've gotta get your brother out of there before he hurts somebody!
Somebody's going to end up dead! You hear me?
[Tom's voice] Girl.
-No, no, no, no, no, no! -[Tom's voice] Girl.
[Tom's voice] Girl.
He just took off.
I don't know, I didn't want to leave Emily to go after him. I'm really, really sorry.
Wait, what?
What happened?
Jesus, Audry, I knew I should've gone with you.
Did you call the police?
No, no, I'm okay. I'm on my way back.
I just don't know what she was doing sending me there, he's insane.
The ferry doesn't leave for a while, so, I'm gonna be late.
Thanks for taking care of her.
Are you all right?
Oh, my God. [screams]
Emily?
Paul?
Paul!
Paul, where's Emily?
Emily!
Emily!
Harry, what are you doing?
Mom!
Emily!
Harry, turn this boat around.
Harry.
Harry!
Harry, you've gotta stop--
Mayday, mayday, mayday, this is the Patty M.
Harry...
Harry, no!
Mom!
Harry, stop!
Harry, please!
Harry, stop!
Mom, what's happening?
[Emily] Mom!
Mom!
Emily!
-It's gonna be okay. -[Emily screaming]
[Emily] Mom!
Mom!
Emily?
It's okay, come here.
Come on...
You're okay. It's okay.
You're okay.
It's gonna be okay.
[Audry] I know it's confusing.
But most of the fish we take out of the water we put right back in just a few days later.
We're learning about them.
We're studying them so we can get to know them better.
So we can help them better.
I know it sounds mean and scary...
but by taking some brave fish out of the water and learning about them...
Mangnilal Prasad.
Current address?
11/24, Sanjay Amar Colony.
New Delhi- 02.
I'll get you enrolled tomorrow.
Day after we'll go to the bank and open an account in his name.
I'll keep the passbook.
Every month I'll pay him 6000 in cash.
I'll keep the debit card too. I don't want any trouble later on.
Make sure there aren't any complaints.
He's a hardworking fellow.
Heard him? Right? Give it your best.
Yes.
Why? What's wrong with this job?
It's very dangerous, there is risk of physical harm!
Bruises, broken bones...
Come on in! There's no time to waste.
Stop dragging your feet.
You, shut the door.
Let us venerate Lord Hanuman
He eradicates evil A devotee of Lord Rama
Because they are treated as Gods, they are given food, they are corrupted,
they are... made to think
that they don't need to forage anymore,
so they become bold. They start entering,
they start demanding.
Then the Gods become pests.
This building needs special attention!
It's a noose around our necks.
If the monkeys were to dislodge any of these domes,
the government would collapse! Our asses would be put on fire!
The first wave of attacks starts at around 8 a.m.
They break into the offices and wreak havoc.
They destroy the security cameras, climb trees and break the branches.
They don't even spare the national flag. You have to prevent this from happening.
Understood? Repeat whatever I told you.
Hall of development...
-First of all, Kingsway! -Yes, Kingsway!
-Then the Hall of Industry. -Hall of Industry!
-From there to the Hall of Development. -Yes, straight to Development.
-And last, the Hall of Science. -Yes, exactly.
We produce three sounds.
Ooo! Monkey.
Eeb! Langur.
Allay! Human.
Ooo, Eeb, Allay!
What if the monkey--
What if the monkey charges at me? Then?
Don't manifest fear! And never look into its eyes.
It's a monkey after all!
These wires were put up for the monkeys.
To give them electric shocks.
People objected when many died.
Eventually this had to stop!
This place seems fun, right? Cool breeze, warm sun,
people milling about. Interesting!
You must be enjoying it.
Don't be fooled! It's a reverie of distant drums!
When you are face to face with a monkey,
When you are face to face with a monkey, you will realize how fucked you really are!
Apart from ensuring security for all,
you have to maintain a cordial equation with officials as well as the public.
It's not just about the monkeys.
Distant drums sound good!
Seems like a nice job, sit around, lunch breaks and then it's time to head home.
lunch breaks and then it's time to head home. It's not.
This job is no child's play. Even the best go affray.
Don't just stand there! Shoo it away!
Run!

Take this.
Take care of yourself.
What's the hurry? Your food isn't running away!
I have to go early from today.
There's some talk about a bonus. Even a hike maybe!
At least one thousand rupees!
Imagine!

For all you know, it could be 1500!
Tell me once it's done! And you, go take off your socks.

The management has come up with a solution.

-Permit for what? -Guns. Permit has been obtained.
Each of you will be given a gun. And for that you will undergo
a training for its use and maintenance.

Yes! Run away!
No!
At it, sir! It's gone!
Here comes another one!
Hey!
Hey! No!
Yes. No. That's what!
That's what I am saying,
"Eeb, Allay, Ooo", every time I use these sounds,
or wave my hands to shoo them, they gnash their teeth and charge straight at me.
Yes.
In my head I understand the theory,
but when they charge at me, my heart...
Yes?
Yes, there is a red stone wall.
I'm right next to it.
Dome? No, I see a balcony.
The dome...
I thought the other red wall. Yes. No... there's nothing there.
Yes. I'm on my way. On it!
It's going... almost gone...
Don't just stand there. Do something!
It's going. Gone! -It's right here. -It's gone.
-It's right here. -It's gone.
-It's gone. I shooed it away. It's gone?
Go on! Work! It's under control!
See! Gone. Shooed it away!

-Can you work a computer? -No.
Electricals? Plumbing?

It's not a government job, it's contractual.

-Narayan's your contractor, right? -Yes, sir.
What's your name?
-Sir, I'm new here. -What's your name?
Sir, I made a mistake. Sorry, sir, I'm new here.
Disrespectful idiot!
Sonu.
-Are you looking for something? -My hair-clip.
-Color? -Black.
Black...
How is your sister feeling?
She is fine.
How do you scare the monkeys?
It depends on them really.
I make sounds.
What sounds?
Look, here.
-Is this it? -Yes! This is it.
Oh, great! So this is it...
Glad I found it. I lose them all the time.
Okay.
Hey.
If your sister doesn't feel good, then knock on my door hard.
The bell isn't working.
Fine, I'll do that.
-Monday, from 6:15 to 7:45? -Yes.
-Okay. -Get the prescription by 5 p.m.
Only till 5 p.m.?
Please! Give me a session today, it's difficult for her to come here.
Try yourself! The doctor might be inside.
-Where? -Next room.
Go quickly and check!
The corner room.
Oh, corner room?
Madam's there.
Doctor! Not madam.
That's what I meant!
Ask her for an appointment.
-Should I ask her directly? -Do that.
-Have you been waiting for long? -Yes.
Give me the reports!
Wait here.
Please come in.
Hemoglobin was as low as nine.
-Blood pressure? -Even that was low.
Check again.
All good?
Yes. I get acidity.
That's normal.
-Have you been taking the medicines? -I've been taking one of those.
One is over.
Of the two, which one are you taking? Which one is over?
-Is it this one? -Yes.
-And the other one? -Well...
-This one. -This got over.
-You didn't buy it then? -No.
What's the point of prescribing then?
Do you want your child to be born stupid?
Avoid sitting in one posture for long...
-Yes? -Yes?
My brother.
Do you work? Or are you dependent on her?
He has a government job.
Monkey-repeller!
Lift from there!
Pull from here!
Put it in between these.
Make sure it's equal on all sides.
Take it to the center.
Pull it out from here, between the mesh. Come on.
No slacking. On the double, come on!
-You're on duty right now. -Yes, yes, on it!
Make sure the wire is fine.
Perfect. Let it be.
Why aren't you putting the bananas out there?
Put some up your ass too!
Stay there! We will open it!
Open it already.
Bring the other cage. Transfer him into that.
This is no time to joke.
-He's the one joking! -Hang the bananas.
You think I'm a monkey?
Today, he's our monkey.
We've already caught one! Call the van now.
How will you give?
We need more bananas. Open it.
-Come, take it from here. -Yes, take it.
Made me into a monkey!
Come on, take it! Up!
Give me. I will pass it.
Take it. Look. Over there.
You have to put it there. Here.
Take it! Take it!
-Okay. -Fine. Done.
-Open up now. -Has the van come?
Almost here.
Open, please!
-Open up... -Bring the cage already!
Would you like to visit the jungle?
I'll show you the lake with blue water. What say?
-That's enough. Open it! -Never mind.
Please open this. I can't breathe! Open the door. Now!
Eat like a monkey and you'll be out!
Come on, show us!
-Eat it. -Eat the whole thing!
Don't gulp it just to escape. Chew!
I'm trying! I can't eat anymore, please let me out!
One last one!
He is hopeless!
Neither can you catch a monkey, nor can you scare one.
I can.
-You can't. -I can.
Then why am I getting complaints?
That long road has hundreds of monkeys...
You scare ten and two will go to the Hall of Development,
then two will go to the Hall of Industries.
They drive me mad and I keep running from one hall to another.
Don't do it then.
Don't do it then.
-It's my fault that I gave you a job. -Please! Don't say that.
-No, I mean it. I apologize, sir! -Don't say that.
Just get lost!
Why are you saying this, sir? Please listen...
Listen to what? Is this all a joke to you?
With the Langurs it was better! The monkeys would run away in no time.
I'll tell you the truth...
Once in a while I do take a tea break.
Am I an idiot here? His Majesty takes tea breaks!
The problem is my tea breaks, right?
I will not go. Done. Sorted.
I will be alert and sharp.
And so it will not happen again.
Now Mahinder will accompany you. Okay?
That means a pay cut?
Isn't that obvious? Someone will be helping you.
Who's going to pay him?
I am sorry. I shouldn't have gone for tea.
He won't give me any money!
He will deduct yours as well as mine.
He is a scoundrel!
-What say? -Don't drag me into all this!
He said there was a complaint.
I was right there at my position,
but one fucker ran straight inside the Hall of Science.
I'm telling you, don't give him any chances.
He's not your friend.
He will kick you out the moment he finds someone cheaper.
Won't take him a minute.
Let's go?
Wait, what's the rush?
What a shit hole!
Where are you coming from?
Work, where else?
Wash your feet first!
-In a bit... -Now!
Did something happen?
No.
Narayan called...
I spoke to him.
He's a big shot, stay in his good books...
Might come handy in the future.
Something is still stinking. Did you wash properly?
I just did...
Must be something inside the house!
Wouldn't I know then?
I'm not doing anything more...
It's his clothes! Go and change it right away!
He'll catch a cold... Wait!
I don't want to do this.
Said something?
I told you I didn't want to do this job.
Where did this come from?
Never pays on time. "There's a complaint."
Speak up.
It's just another way for him to deduct my money.
You believed him and scolded me.
Did I scold him?
I am just sharing it with you,
after all I got you the job.
As if...
Isn't it his job to give me my bank passbook?
Your passbook will scare the monkeys away?
-I'm trying! But they are not scared! -So try harder!
-I'm trying. They are monkeys after all! -That's your job!
-I'm doing it. They're monkeys! -So try harder!
Have you ever dealt with a monkey?
There are hundreds of them there!
You didn't change, after all?
Go do it right now!
Give him fresh clothes.
Look at him.
So? Go do your job.
You eat. Let me sort him out.
Sir! What are you doing?
Sharing my hard-earned money with the Gods.
But these Gods of yours...
Give me 50 bucks, I will do it for you.
Stop shivering first!
Move!
One second!
You carry on...
The monkeys have gone to the other side.
There is one right there.
It's not going away. Let me do my job.
As if you are the only one accountable.
Get lost!
Are you sure it's a bike injury?
The monkey ran towards the minister's residence.
So, I ran after it.
But I tripped and fell.
As I got up, I saw that a bike had run it over...
To fight them, I must think like them.
Why don't you become their leader?
Think like them, live like them.
Why don't you do that?
That one had been driving me mad.
This past week...
This was the one inciting the others.
So, use your voice to scare it. Why don't you work on your voice?
Use your voice to scare them.
Do something!
How else will you scare them?
Didn't I teach you the sounds?
Forget the sounds.
One kick on the ass, and they'll run away instantly.
And everybody else will pay for your adventures!
This is Raisina Hill, traditionally ruled by monkeys!
Even the courts acknowledge that.
Then why give a catapult?
It's for show.
-Weapons are not to be used. -Yes.
Use your voice. Don't do all this. Keep this in mind.
If I have it, then I will use it.
The bullet goes here, okay?
-It's stuck. -Use your strength and pull.
-Can't pull it. -How will you fire then?
Pull this, yes.
Not happening.
Watch how easy it is.
-See! -Only this much?
Yes, that's it.
-That's enough to screw you up! -Here's another one.
It's that easy!
Even the kids in my village are used to gunfire.
The most trivial fights can become gunfights.
When I was shot, I could feel the blood draining out.
I started feeling weak, and started losing a lot of blood!
By the time I reached the hospital, I had fainted.
-Shall I leave? -Yes.
This is how a Langur sounds.
This is a fight.
-A fight? -Yes, a fight.
-You think so? -I know so...
-Is that so? -Yes.
-You do it. -Eeb...
Allay... Ooo...
It's better when I am facing a monkey.
-Do it right now. -I can't right now.
Splash! Splash!
Not me!
Have you spoken to them yet?
Yes or no?
Is this the time to discuss all that?
With you it's never a good time, is it?
Can't you be satisfied with an increment of Rs. 1500?
Nothing makes you happy.
And what about the terror that you have got home in return?
You hanker over every rupee with the agent.
I don't like it. You have it.
Let's look over there.
Okay. Let's see. What say?
Beautiful.
Get rid of this right now!
I asked you to get rid of it!
You think I'm stupid? Throw it out!
What's your problem?
Okay, calm down.
Don't just sit there holding it. Take it outside!
He's going. Calm down.
-Give this to her now. Okay? -Okay.
-If you need anything-- -I'll knock on your door.
Are the monkeys scared yet?
They've got their tails between their legs.
Is it because of the gun?
It's because of this.
-Because of? -With my mind.
The first team will shoo them away,
and the other will trap them.
We will have four people between Vijay Chowk and the Tomb
facing the Hall of Industry and Hall of Development,
and all monkeys need to be chased away, towards Shastri Nagar.
Sure, sir.
-Keep them away from the event. -Yes, sir.
No incidents will be tolerated.
I will personally ensure that, sir.
I have a complaint.
It says that your boys have put up Langur posters in public spaces.
Photos? Sir, that's not possible. They use sounds, sir.
Listen, my blood pressure is already high. Republic Day is approaching,
delegates from ten countries are here.
Our national honor is at stake!
If even one monkey intervenes, it'll be a problem.
Don't worry, sir! We all are here to serve you.
Yes! By putting up these posters?
Sir, my boys can't be responsible. They use sounds.
What are you looking at them for? You've hired these boys.
-Who else will do it? Don't lie to me. -No, sir.
I am letting you know. I will terminate your contract.
Sir, please don't do this! We didn't do it.
You are being paid to do this job. This is not done!
Have you gone there and checked?
-No... -Then!
Whose responsibility is it? You don't know what your boys are up to.
-Sir, I... -What good are you?
Hey, come here.
Why did you put up those posters?
-Answer me! -Sir...
-Tell me. -Sir... there were a lot of monk--
Then scare them, you dimwit. That's your job, isn't it?
Putting up posters!
What kind of fashion is this?
You better fix yourself up tomorrow and come. Or else...
Mahinder.
Did you hear what I said?
Yes.
You will go with him tomorrow.
And if he fucks up, I will fuck you. Did you get it?
If you do anything...
Please let me go!
Watch out!
Mend your ways.
Otherwise you'll be begging on the streets of Delhi.
You wanted a raise, didn't you?
For that you have to carry a gun.
What's the logic in that, sir?
But it's an on-site requirement.
You shouldn't have got a license made.
Why is gun a requirement, sir?
What the hell are you doing! Look at what you've done!
Who is going to clean all the muck?
And the lights?
-Excuse me, sir? -Wait!
Just stop that for a minute. And this? Get it checked, right away.
What's his name?
-Sir, Shashi. -Call him.
Come, Shashi.
Come, Shashi. Sit.
-Sir, I will come later. -Just come and sit.
Hello. One, two, three. Check mic.
Start the ride.
-So, tell me? -Is it necessary to keep a rifle?
For that matter, it's not necessary to have a job either.
What happened? Are you scared?
No... Never needed a gun before.
What if you need it now?
Sir, what if I fire by mistake?
Then there will be big trouble. You can lose your job.
Can't we figure something out?
Is it a game or some drama?
Sir, drama is happening in my life.
My wife is pregnant
and gets extremely upset when she sees a rifle in the house...
Why?
Rifle is a bad omen for her.
A weapon in my small house?
Relax. Relax...
I will try, but I can't assure you.
In any case you will lose your increment.
Everyone else, back to work!
Collect the light and end all darkness
Nationalism! Nationalism!
Nationalism should fill all our hearts
Worship, we all must
That our nation becomes powerful and successful
Pray, we all must!
Like every year, people have arrived from each corner of the country
without worrying about the cold, without worrying about the weather.
The capital New Delhi's Rajpath is ready in all its grandeur
for Republic Day celebrations.
It was today in 1950 that our constitution came into effect
and we became a Republic.
Long live India!
We are the river We know our skills
Whichever way we walk The path will become
There... I saw him wearing a sweater...
Didn't you see?
You are the definition of time
You are the decision and decision-maker
You are the mother I bow to
You are the ruler of the minds of all people
Welcome! Welcome!
Welcome! Welcome!
Welcome!
Welcome! Welcome!
Welcome! Welcome!
Our country is a golden bird We're surrounded by flowers
Our country is a golden bird We're surrounded by flowers
Monkeys here, monkeys there
Monkeys, monkeys, everywhere
-I am his friend. -Friend? What does he do?
He scares off monkeys for NDMC.
Do you know what he was doing? Any idea?
He was bursting bombs.
-Bomb! -He was scaring kids...
Let him go, madam.
He is a little... He won't do it again.
A 'little' what?
He is a little crazy...
Then take him to an asylum. Or should we treat him?
-He's a poor chap, madam. -As if you are the only ones.
Let him go, madam. It's not like he's committed a murder!
It could have been much worse.
Kids were running all scared... What if something untoward happened?
Would they have taken responsibility?
Dare you speak on their behalf.
-You were nowhere to be seen. -No.
Listen to his voice once. Very sweet and innocent.
And if the monkeys don't run, I will lock both of you up.
Where did you get all of this from?
Enough!
You should've seen the monkeys... They were shitting bricks!
Shitting bricks my ass!
You would be the one shitting your pants had Narayan come to know.
You spent the entire night in lock-up!
Do you realize that?
I don't care!
The monkeys are scared. That's enough!
Another one, hold still.
-Have I caught it? -Perfectly. You are tugging at it.
-Here... -Show.
-Nice! -Your turn.
Let's go.
-Lift your hand. -Now?
Stretch it out properly.
Okay.
Did you see that?
"As a joke, the groom's family asked for a Langur."
"To scare off monkeys."
"The bride's family took this seriously."
"The girl reached her in-laws' place with a Langur."
"The Langur patrolled the farm for 3 days."
"During this time, no monkey dared to venture nearby."
"The Forest Department got to know
and served a notice asking him
to explain why he kept the Langur captive."
Bravo!
Langur being given as dowry? Wow!
Isn't asking for dowry a bigger crime?
That only the groom can tell. But, Langur!
Will you ask for dowry?
Will you give?
I treat patients not the hospital.
Nor do I come here as a hobby.
That's the difference.
-What? -You scare, I save.
Madam, this note's torn.
It will work.
-No, it won't. -Excuse me.
Have you seen this Langur Man around?
He was here a few days ago.
Is his face black?
Yeah.
-Has ankle-bells? -Yes.
Long tail?
Do you know him?
No. Where did you see him?
Who is he?
How does he look?
-Doesn't he look good? -Don't overdo it.
What? I have sent it to everyone.
Everyone must have seen it. 3,00,000 views already.
That many?
You've become a small time hero.
Yeah, hero only...
With the foreigners!
A Japanese couple too.
-How did you do this? -My brains!
What's up? Hero's video is being watched?
Yes.
Have you seen this one?
I sent it.
No, you haven't seen this one.
Of course I have. The ice-cream one?
-First, he snatches the ice-cream. -Yes.
His expression!
And then...
Did you tell them at home?
-Perfect. -We can take once together.
-Awesome. Thank you so much. -Thank you.
-50 rupees. -He's asking for money.
-50 rupees. -I don't have any change.
Do you have... Yeah.
Thank you.
Sir, I am really sorry.
You are fired.
Sir, I really don't know who made those videos.
Please believe me...
-Are his papers ready? -Listen to me...
It's not my fault...
Sir, please listen.
I have no idea who made those videos, sir.
It's not my fault. It really isn't.
Listen to me, please...
I beg you. Sir...
Not that, sir. Please, I beg you.
I beg you with folded hands!
Didn't I tell you to mend your ways or you'd end up begging?
Come.
She is iron deficient. Do you know what that means?
Can't take care of his wife... Wants to have kids!
She is growing weak, don't make her work.
She doesn't listen.
Have some shame!
Do you have any sense of responsibility?
Where were you?
Tell me, where the hell were you? Why didn't you answer your phone?
Don't you have any sense of responsibility?
I was stuck!
Listen, Mr. Governor got stuck!
She fainted.
She is iron deficient. Come on.
You better mend your ways!
Where the hell were you?
Are you dumb? You asshole!
Must be very happy?
Should I garland you?
I thought you'd make something of yourself in the city.
Made yourself a bloody joker in the gutter. Asshole!
God says that if one prays, one is rewarded,
but nothing is happening.
Don't you dare tell her or I'll smash your face.
You don't know what the doctor said.
She can't have any stress.
No, Brother!
It's just not possible.
Word has reached Dr. Pramod.
He is scared of the human rights people.
Does Dr. Pramod listen to anyone? Once he decides, that's it...
Yes, but help this kid.
Came all the way from his village.
Mahinder, you know it can't be done.
If I could, I would, you know that.
I take his guarantee.
I showed him the area. Taught him the voice.
And now you are doing this.
You don't say much, understand?
All this happened under your watch.
30 million jobs!
And I can't find one in Delhi.
Can you read and write English?
I can understand.
What's the use?
Now, I need to learn English too!
Go to an office and they will ask for a certificate.
Go to a house, they will hand me brooms.
Then do it!
You want me to be a sweeper!
It's just a job.
Don't make political speeches.
I am not making any speech.
I am being sensible. So, it's hurting you?
-Keep your sensibilities to yourself. -Don't think high of yourself.
I'm not.
Reading a few books doesn't make you a scholar!
Look for it yourself!
What kind of job?
I've studied till 11th grade.
You wouldn't find that kind of work here.
Please refer me if there is any work.
I mean not just here... anywhere around also... any kind of work.
I am in dire need.
After months of unrest,
disgruntled contractual sanitation workers registered their protest.
By throwing garbage in front of the Deputy Mayor's house.
There isn't any vacancy.
I can carry the load.
I have enough workers already.
You may need more people to ferry these to the market... I can do it.
No! There is no work.
If I had any, I would tell you.
ANJANI- FOR WORK
ANJANI- FOR WORK
ANJANI- FOR WORK
Once I took you around the market with a bindi.
I put a bindi, made you wear a frock, bangles. Even made you a ponytail.
You looked so beautiful.
-You won't remember, you were too young. -I remember.
-How can you remember? -I do. Mom has a picture.
Always treating the youngest as a toy.
Are you upset with me?
No.
You have changed.
Now you do drugs. Lie to me.
Don't tell me anything.
Why are you getting so emotional?
You never told me about losing your job.
What are you doing? There are no monkeys!
Don't you want your 1000 bucks?
Of course!
Then keep making sounds!
We are the Langurs, sir!
Good shot!
What happened?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
Your sound is special.
What a character!
You have something that I will never have.
Only you have it, you're an artist.
Please record it for me once. Your three sounds.
Have you lost it?
-No, I insist! -Are you mad or what?
Listen, I'll memorize them, and impress Dr. Pramod.
And get my job back.
Please let me record.
-Why are you doing all this? -Please, let me record!
Don't be stupid!
You have to! Please try and understand...
Fine! Do whatever you want!
-Do it. -One minute...
Start!
I played throughout my childhood And slept through my youth
I cried at my old age
Come on time tomorrow.
Don't be late. Yeah? Yeah. Of course.
I cried at my old age
This is an old story
Listen! Get a box of sweets.
Dr. Pramod has a sweet tooth.
-Really? -Your work will be done. Guaranteed!
Your riches will be left behind
What are you arrogant of, my dear?
Don't you understand... someone has to take responsibility for the body.
How can I mark it as unclaimed? He worked here, didn't he?
Where is that bloody contractor?
-What happened? -Someone died on duty.
Ranjit, who died?
Mahinder. He killed a monkey by mistake.
A mob killed him!
I want the complete documents!
Wait... Where are you going?
-To meet Narayan. -He's not there.
-He's not? -No.
I know he is here.
He is not here. The hospital is shut.
Why are you lying to me for no reason?
But he's not here.
Alright, I will wait for him.
Once he is here,
-I will speak with him. -Just go, man!
-No. -Get out.
I am staying right here. Today I won't leave without my salary.
-Who will give you your salary? -There is no one here?
-I already told you. -And what if I find him?
I am telling you there is no one.
I will see it for myself, leave me!
Was he on drugs?
Come here.
Come here.
Come in...
Tell me, why are you here?
Sir, I came to collect my salary...
He is Anjani. He worked with Mahinder.
He's dismissed right now.
Did you work with Mahinder?
-Yes. -Since when have you known him?
About 3-4 months.
Did he do drugs?
No.
But it's there in his medical report.
-Do you do drugs? -No, sir.
Shall I get you checked?
-What happened? -Nothing.
Leave it. I'll do it.
I said I'm fine.
Leave it, leave it.
-I said let me do it. -You're always so stubborn.
He'll be here soon.
-How many are left? -Lots...
He's here.
Done?
You said 9:30?
I know. I am early, I'll wait. Finish up.
Come at 10 o'clock. it will be done.
10? You said 9:30.
There's no electricity, that's why.
The rest of the neighborhood has electricity.
-Different phases, right? -Stop it!
I have taken an advance, I have to deliver.
Finish it by 9:30.
Get out.
-Come by 10. -I need it by 9:30 p.m.
Out. Right now.
Shut up! I am talking to her. Bloody asshole!
-What did you say? -Get the hell out!
Whom did he just abuse? Get out!
-I get you work, and you behave like this! -Are you doing us a favor?
Leave. Please leave.
Your wife is pregnant, otherwise I would have buried you alive.
Take her name and I will butcher you here.
You'll butcher me? You?
Why don't you just leave? Please, leave.
Can't even afford two square meals and are out to have a child!
Wait...
I'm telling you to leave, you will get it all by 10.
-This has become a daily circus! -It'll be ready by 10.
What were you saying?
Come on, say it! Why are you quiet now?
-Repeat what you said. -What are you doing?
What are you doing? Please, stop.
-Repeat what you said. -Let him go.
-Should I leave? -Okay.
What have you done?
-Look at this fitting. -This is how Santa Claus looks.
-Look at the sleeve. -Must be a mistake in measurements.
-Isn't that your job? Fix this. -Must be a mistake in measurements.
What about this?
What can I do?
You tell me.
Where will I use it?
Ramleela has monkeys.
Ramleela has Hanuman, not Langurs.
Bali had monkeys and Sugriva had Langurs.
You seem to know quite a lot?
I was stating facts.
Stand straight.
The cap's torn too.
Tell me?
-What did you pay? -Rs. 2000.
-You will get half. -Fine.
Here, take the money and get out.
What is this? I have got hundreds of these.
Show.
This is original.
I can't pay for this.
Keep it.
-Show. -Here.
It's real.
The terror of monkeys in Delhi is now a matter of concern for the Vice President.
Although the Delhi Municipal Council is coming up with new schemes
to catch these monkeys...
All the efforts by the administration are in vain.
The population of monkeys has been increasing.
The reason is, they are being fed well
and they have been breeding.
They start entering, they start demanding.
Then the Gods become pests.
The police are acting smart. Under IPC Section 324,
they've lodged an FIR against a monkey.
Who are you?
Who would've thought someone with your shady background
would get so far, and become the corporate general manager.
Cheers!
-Cheers. -To success in your new position.
Thanks, Don Jaime, but I owe it all to you and your trust in me.
Nonsense! You earned it in your own right.
It's a shame your family couldn't be here on such an important day.
I would love to meet them and congratulate them in person.
You might not remember, but I told you a while back
You might not remember, but I told you a while back that my parents passed away when I was an only child.
My only family is my dear Mari and my beautiful children.
You don't need much else, my boy.
Your wife's a hot piece of ass.
You truly hit the jackpot. She's pretty much the reason
You truly hit the jackpot. She's pretty much the reason you've been losing your tackiness, and small town ways.
Isn't that right, Mariquita?
Thanks, Don Jaime.
Dinner is served, please take your seats.
Dinner is served, please take your seats. Go ahead.
-Monsignor, please. -Please, go ahead.
-Monsignor, please. -Please, go ahead. Thanks.
-Your napkin, dear. -Sorry, my love.
Thank you.
Enjoy everyone. We hired an excellent caterer.
Try the foie gras, sir and the Jabugo ham is to die for.
Are we expecting anyone?
Honey, did you invite anyone else?
Sir? There are two men at the door asking for you.
They say they're relatives, but they're really ugly and they stink.
I'm sure there must be some kind of mistake.
Don Jaime, give me two minutes to sort this out.
I'll be right back. Excuse me.
Check it out, Pops!
I figured this son of a bitch was swimming in cash,
and that's why he's forgotten about us.
Do you know them?
Do you know this pair of shabby scumbags?
Who, them? No, I've never met them.
Listen up pals! This is private property.
If you don't fuck off right now,
I'll call my bodyguards to kick you out!
López probably sent them to ruin the party.
Listen up, dandies!
First person that moves gets pumped full of lead!
Pops, I've told you, no one calls them dandies anymore.
That was back in your day. Like the President says,
That was back in your day. Like the President says, these fuckers are privileged conservatives.
To me, they're the same scum that derailed the Revolution.
Dad! Grandpa!
This isn't the time.
Let me send my guests home, and we'll talk this through.
Screw your guests.
The only way they're leaving is in a body bag!
Stop the nonsense!
Friends, let's not get caught up in the intolerance and polarization
promoted by this populist government.
If it's money you want, I have plenty.
If it's money you want, I have plenty. I'll give you as much as you want.
-Take your money… -Yes.
-…roll it up… -Yes?
And stick it up your ass.
Please get a grip on Grandpa. Dad, I'm begging you.
-You're going to ruin my life! -Ruin your life, Panchito?
Look how you've treated us, ungrateful bastard.
The whole family made sacrifices to put you through college,
The whole family made sacrifices to put you through college, and look how you've repaid us.
Twenty years of neglect and abandonment!
All the while living the high life at our expense, huh?
All right, Rosendo. Quit being such a pansy.
Take them to the back, let's get this over with!
Yes, Pops. Come on, move it!
You too, blondie! Move your asses!
-You're staying right here. -Panchito, come with me.
-Come on, hurry. -Wait, no!
Go on, move it!
Back to the wall!
Now, face the firing squad!
Dad, Grandpa… I realize I've been an ungrateful, lousy son,
but I swear that from now on, things will be different.
What's mine will be yours, and I will never abandon you.
Too late, Panchito.
The hour of revolutionary justice has come for you.
The poor come first now!
-Blindfold him, Rosendo. -Sure, Pops!
Please don't!
Please, Dad. I'm begging you.
Think of my children.
You've always been so good to me.
Sorry, Panchito.
When you had the chance to help us, you didn't.
It's time for you to pay for all your bullshit.
By the way, your mother and siblings send their love.
Thank you.
-Ready, Rosendo? -Yes, Pops.
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Fran? Fran!
Pancho!
Having one of your nightmares again?
Oh, Mari, you have no idea what a horrible dream I had.
-Your family, again? -Yeah.
I've told you a thousand times, you need to see a therapist.
This isn't normal. Now, let me get some sleep
This isn't normal. Now, let me get some sleep before your alarm goes off.
Yeah, I could use some sleep myself,
I have a big day tomorrow.
Good morning. -Morning, Dad! -Good morning, Lupita.
I'm meeting with Don Jaime, I can't be late.
-Can I fix you something? -Just a coffee, real quick. How do I look?
A little tired, but super handsome.
-So handsome, Daddy! -Thanks, sweetie.
Why do you keep wearing those shoes with that suit?
The black Ferragamos look so much better.
I don't have time to change, what can I say?
Fix your shirt, it looks wrong.
Hello? Yes, this is the residence of the Reyes family.
Who?
Oh, one moment.
Sir, it's for you. Says he's your dad, Rosendo.
Sir, it's for you. Says he's your dad, Rosendo. He says it's important.
No, tell him I'm not here. Tell him you don't know when I'll be back.
Lupita, whatever you do, don't give him my cell phone.
Got it?
Mr. Rosendo?
Mr. Pancho left for work, he's not sure when he'll be back.
No, I don't have his personal number.
Oh. Don't worry, I'll tell him for you.
Okay, then. Goodbye.
He says it's an emergency, something about your grandpa.
He says it's an emergency, something about your grandpa. He wants you to call him back.
Such bad timing -This is the last thing I need. -Do you know what he wants?
-This is the last thing I need. -Do you know what he wants?
He probably wants money, but I can't deal with him today.
I would've liked to talk with Grandpa.
Some other day, champ.
-Bye, family! See you later. -Bye, Daddy!
-Have a nice day, sir. -Bye!
This is what I've been saying, all this area is filthy, so this guy over here…
Missed a spot. How's the A-4?
-Fantastic, sir. -Perfect.
How is this machine still out of order?
Why haven't you fixed it?
Good on supplies? Perfect. Mr. Reyes, your father is calling for you.
Mr. Reyes, your father is calling for you.
Mr. Reyes, Mr Reyes, your father is on hold.
Good morning. Raise your hand if you can hear me.
Thank you.
Colleagues, as all of you know, the economic situation is dire
Colleagues, as all of you know, the economic situation is dire for the country and our factory.
Despite our efforts and sacrifices to stay ahead of this situation,
only Mr. Sampaolo's generosity has kept us afloat.
Unfortunately, the situation has become unsustainable.
We only have two options if we hope to stay in business.
Either we move the plant and its subsidiaries to Asia,
or we could opt for a drastic, yet necessary downsizing.
Appealing to your solidarity to your colleagues,
I ask that you raise your hand to volunteer for early retirement.
All right, since no one is taking the company's generous offer,
I will be selecting those who will be laid off.
Alcántara, Tiburcio.
Bojórquez, Ignacio.
Cárdenas, Cuitláhuac.
Mr. Reyes, Mr. Reyes.
You have a call from your father.
-Damn it. -Mr. Reyes.
You have a call from your father.
Please! Colleagues, please.
Congratulations, Pancho.
Thanks to you, productivity is off the charts.
-And profits are higher than ever! -Thank you, Don Jaime.
-How many did you sack today? -Another 40.
Honestly, I don't think there's any more fat to trim.
There always is, Pancho.
Once the new machines from Germany get here,
we'll be able to cut an extra ten percent off those parasites.
Another 180 employees out on the street?
I hope the union doesn't threaten a strike. Those commie troublemakers from the union can suck my dick!
Those commie troublemakers from the union can suck my dick!
Now that our populist president keeps gushing over the poor,
they're starting to think they can make demands.
Yes, Licha?
Mr. Sampaolo, sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Reyes' secretary is here with me.
She says she urgently needs to speak with him.
Send her in, Licha.
Good afternoon, Don Jaime. I'm sorry to interrupt.
Good afternoon, Don Jaime. I'm sorry to interrupt. Mr. Reyes, your father has been calling all morning.
Mr. Reyes, your father has been calling all morning.
He needs to talk to you, it's a life-or-death emergency.
Don't worry, I know my dad. I'm sure it's nothing.
Tell him I'm not here,
and next time I'm in a meeting with Mr. Sampaolo,
do me a favor, never interrupt me.
Certainly, sir. Once again, I'm sorry to bother you.
You can bother me whenever you want, gorgeous.
I can't promise not to spank you, though,
or maybe even bend you over my desk, kitten.
Are you tapping that ass, fucking Pancho?!
-No. -She's smoking hot,
and anyone can see she needs a good fuck.
No way, Don Jaime. Not in this day and age,
No way, Don Jaime. Not in this day and age, when you can get accused of sexual misconduct over nothing.
All that bullshit about #MeToo, and anti-harassment policies can suck my dick.
That's why I'm the boss, don't you think?
Yeah, of course.
What's this about your family? I thought you were an orphan.
No, you must be mistaking me for someone else.
I'm sure that my father is overreacting.
My family thinks I'm rich,
so they're always hitting me up for money.
Tell them to fuck off! My poor relatives are the same.
I'll always remember what my father used to say.
"From the family and the sun, the farther, the better."
What was I saying before your slutty secretary came in?
That's right, I was saying I'm sick of this government,
and its Echeverría-era populism.
I might as well sell the plant to the gringos,
or move the entire operation to China or Singapore.
-I even had budgets drawn up. -No way, Don Jaime.
-I even had budgets drawn up. -No way, Don Jaime. Don't even joke about that. It's just… how should I put it?
Don't even joke about that. It's just… how should I put it?
I haven't paid off my mortgage yet.
Don't worry about that.
Despite your dubious social background,
you're one of us now.
If you keep up the good work, and learn English and Mandarin,
I might just promote you to general corporate manager.
General manager? Are you serious?
General manager? Are you serious? Of course I am.
Tell you what, handle the Aguascalientes plant.
See if there are any parasites we can exterminate!
You got it, Don Jaime. Excuse me.
What is it Lupita?
My father, again?
If he calls again, tell him you couldn't find me.
Yeah, just tell him. Tell the missus I'm on my way.
Fine, then. When she gets home. Bye.
Good day, sir.
We wanted to talk to you about the layoffs.
Cirilo, I'm terribly sorry but I have a meeting. Let's talk some other time. Sorry, excuse me.
Let's talk some other time. Sorry, excuse me.
Small town, new-money.
He won't forget us, though.
-Am I right? -Yeah.
ASSHOLE
Jealous fuckers. No wonder the country is going to shit.
Up yours!
PARADISE HILLS, MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE!
-I'm home! -Oh, Fran.
I'm so glad you're home, I'm losing my mind.
-What happened? -Your dad keeps calling. And I'm fed up.
-Did he say what's it about? -Something about your grandpa.
-Did he say what's it about? -Something about your grandpa. -He wants to tell you himself. -New dress again, darling?
-He wants to tell you himself. -New dress again, darling?
It's for Paloma's wedding. Saks had a sale, I couldn't resist.
I got you a tie, and some Montblanc gold cufflinks to die for.
-Do you like it? It's Dolce. -I mean, it's very nice.
Please, you have to stop spending, our credit cards are maxed out.
-I know, yes. -Where are the kids?
-I know, yes. -Where are the kids? Toni, Cati! Come say hi to your dad.
Toni, Cati! Come say hi to your dad.
If the wife doesn't spend, the husband won't prosper.
What's up, kiddos? How's it going?
Any news? Why haven't you changed?
I got an A in history!
Sister Idalia gave me the role of Cinderella.
That's great to hear, because I also have big news.
-What? -No, no. Go with Lupita and get changed for dinner.
Go with Lupita and get changed for dinner.
-You got extra vacation days? -Patience, María Elena.
Don Jaime congratulated me and said if I keep it up,
and I learn English and Mandarin, he'll make me general manager.
He might just make me partner.
-Does it come with a raise? -Of course, at least double.
-Does it come with a raise? -Of course, at least double. As much as that wimp of a manager makes.
Congratulations.
The truth is, we need a new SUV and a better school for the kids.
One where they can meet more affluent kids,
and learn English and French. You know what else? We should get a beach house.
You know what else? We should get a beach house. -Don't you think? -Yeah!
-Don't you think? -Yeah!
When you're the boss, will you buy me a motorcycle?
-I want a pony like Paty's. -Hang on.
Before you get too excited and spend it all,
we need to pay off the mortgage first,
then we need to pay off the cars,
but more importantly, María Elena,
we have to pay off our loans and the credit cards, right?
-What? -Don't be a downer.
Honey, I'm not a downer, I'm being realistic.
We can't just spend money as if we were rich.
At least not until I get that promotion.
Excuse me.
Lupita, come here.
What is this slop?
What you told me to cook, cheese and spinach "chuflé."
What you told me to cook, cheese and spinach "chuflé." More than a soufflé, this looks like clay.
I told you to check with me if you had any questions.
Yes, but you went "chopping" so I did what I could.
Take this away and make us some turkey sandwiches.
To teach you a lesson, you're eating the whole thing.
-All right? -Yes, ma'am, as you wish.
It's not enough she's filthy, she doesn't know her place.
I don't know why you engage with the help.
Should I say you're not here? I'm sure it's your father again.
I'll get it, Lupita.
My goodness, she thinks she's one of us.
-Hello? -Hi, son!
How are you Dad?
How's everything?
Let me tell you, son.
Your grandfather Francisco, may God rest his soul,
passed away a few days ago.
Grandpa Francisco died? How old was he?
-I'm so sorry. -We just did the math.
He was somewhere around 120, but no one knows for sure.
Give my love to Mom and Grandma Pascuala.
-Mari also sends her love. -I will, son.
Listen, it's very important that you come to Prosperidad.
That's going to be a bit difficult.
I'm swamped with work.
We don't really have much of a choice here.
Pancho, look. As part of your grandpa's last will and testament,
As part of your grandpa's last will and testament, he wanted you to attend his funeral. And he ordered his attorney
And he ordered his attorney not to open his will until you are present.
not to open his will until you are present.
If you don't come home, they might even kick us out of the house.
Oh, man. That really sucks.
Listen, this really isn't a good time for me.
Maybe I could try to visit in December, how's that?
Come on, son. Don't do this to us.
Grandpa died days ago, he's starting to stink.
Don't you get it? It's a case of life and death.
What do you want me to say? I can't do it, period.
Fine! If you can't, you can't! What else is there to say?
I can't force you to come.
All right, give my love to everyone back home!
Same here, Pancho! But let me tell you,
Same here, Pancho! But let me tell you, coming from you, I'm not surprised at all. You've always been a lousy son.
coming from you, I'm not surprised at all. You've always been a lousy son.
Selfish, ungrateful, and a full-fledged bastard!
Come on. Let's go, Filemón.
He hung up on me.
Oh, Fran. You've never been close to your family.
Oh, Fran. You've never been close to your family. -I'm surprised you're so upset. -No, sweetheart.
-I'm surprised you're so upset. -No, sweetheart. My family is the worst, but grandpa was different.
I was his favorite.
He helped me move away and paid for my education.
Really? Maybe you should visit your family after all.
-To claim your inheritance. -What inheritance?
A plot of land somewhere? A house in ruins?
Two donkeys and a cow? There's nothing of value.
Maybe he left you the house. I'm sure it's worth something.
I mean, sure.
But my parents and siblings have always lived there,
So if I end up getting it, I can't just kick them out.
I'd like to visit your hometown to meet my grandparents.
I want a donkey and a cow to live with us!
-Aren't they sweet? -Yeah.
I promise to take you to Prosperidad one day,
so you can meet the family and see where I grew up.
You'll see how beautiful the town is.
You know what, family?
We should go to bed, it's getting late.
-Shall we? -Here are the sandwiches. -Don't you want them? -Thanks, have a good night.
-Don't you want them? -Thanks, have a good night. Lupita, you can eat them or toss them out.
But eat the whole soufflé, see if you learn. Good night.
Up yours!
Do you profess or practice the Catholic faith?
I'm a Christian…
-Please, shut him off. -Why, honey?
I'm sick of seeing him everywhere.
I hate his tropical accent,
and his endless speeches about the noble masses,
and that the poor come first.
"Let's take from the rich and give to the poor."
…like the works of Jesus.
He was the most important fighter for social justice.
He's comparing himself to Jesus now!
The country is in shambles, maybe he has a point.
Don't even joke about that. Like my girlfriends say,
he's a populist demagogue who'll ruin our country
and turn it into Cuba or Venezuela.
That's ridiculous. You know what?
You and Don Jaime should chat about the President.
If you heard the stuff he says, you'd idolize him.
I'm sure Don Jaime is right.
Good night, Lord Populist.
Good night, Lady Privilege.
Hey, Fran.
Are you absolutely sure it's not worth finding out
what your grandfather left you?
Maybe he has something you don't know about.
No, I'm absolutely sure it's not worth it.
Good night, sleep well.
Night.
Pancho!
Pancho, come here!
Check out what I found.
Another one, Grandpa?
This one's huge! How many does this make?
Plenty, my boy. Plenty.
Don't forget this is a secret just between you and me.
In the end, once I'm gone, all this will be yours.
Of course, Grandpa. Don't worry.
Always remember that it's full of vultures out there,
just waiting around to steal from us!
You haven't said anything to anyone, have you?
Nothing about the treasure?
How about my safe, Pancho?
I haven't told anyone! I swear to God.
I don't believe you, you lying brat.
I'm sure you told your parents and your siblings.
I have to make sure you keep your mouth shut,
Forever!
Fran!
You were having another nightmare.
We have to go to Prosperidad. We have to go to Prosperidad.
I want to ask for the chance of taking three weeks off.
What do you mean, three weeks off?
Not even I take that much time off!
I'm not going on vacation, Don Jaime.
I have a very serious family situation,
and they need me in town to handle some paperwork.
Pancho, you disappoint me.
I put so much trust on you and you repay me with this?
Just because I'm fond of you, I'll give you five days.
Just because I'm fond of you, I'll give you five days. -No more. -Thank you so much.
-No more. -Thank you so much.
Rest assured, I'll leave everything in order.
I'll be back before Thursday to sign for the new machines.
Don't take your eye off the prize.
Thank you, sir.
Are we almost there, Daddy?
Princess, I already told you we're three hours away.
-Take another nap. -Your hometown is so far!
We should've flown to Durango and rented a car there.
Honey, I told you already. Coming from Durango,
Honey, I told you already. Coming from Durango, it's an eight-hour drive across the mountain range.
it's an eight-hour drive across the mountain range.
Oh, really? How long has it been now?
We're getting closer, right, family?
Yeah.
Good.
Hey, Mom. Tell us the truth.
How come you haven't met Dad's family?
Don't ask me, ask him.
How come, Dad? Were you ashamed of them?
To tell you the truth, I don't really know.
First, I finished college, got a job at the plant,
then I met your mom, we got married,
and then you were born. I guess we just kept putting it off.
I guess we just kept putting it off.
The other day, I heard Mom telling Aunt Jackie
that you never visited because my grandparents are gross,
and they're always asking for money.
Catalina!
-Not cool. -When did you last visit?
If memory serves, it's been 20 years
since the last time I visited Prosperidad.
Twenty years without seeing your parents?
That's almost twice my age.
-Holy shit. -Toni!
I've told you over and over not to cuss.
Don't even think about cussing in front of your grandparents.
Look at that, family. We made it to the detour.
Great, does that mean we're almost there?
No, it's two more hours
-Take a nap. -Listen to your parents.
Lupita, give Cati a pillow and find the snacks.
Just don't leave crumbs everywhere.
Yes, Mom.
Check out this landscape. So beautiful.
Two hours of this?
-Can we roll up the windows? -Good idea.
-Turn on the A/C. -No, the dust will get in.
Does it remind you of your home, Lupita?
No way, sir. San Pedro de los Saguaros is much nicer, no offense.
San Pedro de los Saguaros is much nicer, no offense.
It's so hot.
I'm roasting, jeez.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
We need to move that yuca. Can you help me, Lupita?
Yes, sir.
-Let me get off, I'll help. -Jesus!
-Kids, get out of the car. -Okay.
-Grab that side, Lupita. We'll carry it. -Sure.
-It's so heavy, sir. -Hold on.
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
-Here we go. -Fran.
What is it, honey? What?
Mom!
Howdy, friend. That yuca looks heavy.
Yeah, but we have it under control.
Lucky you.
This is a lonely road, it gets pretty dangerous.
-Isn't that right? -Stay put, miss. Gentlemen, please. Let's all relax.
Gentlemen, please. Let's all relax.
Here's my watch and my wallet.
You're welcome to take anything from the car.
Any relation to the Reyes from Prosperidad?
Yes, that's my family.
Fucking Pancho Reyes.
Don't you recognize me?
Filiberto R. Arriaga.
We were together in elementary school.
Beto? Didn't we use to call you Mapache?
Well, sorry about this. A man's gotta make a living.
Yeah, I get it.
-You're here about your grandpa. -Yes, such a tragedy.
My deepest condolences.
May God keep Don Francisco in his holy glory.
Thank you, Beto.
Brother.
-Thanks. -You staying in town?
Let's meet up for a drink and catch up.
-Sure, I'd love to. -You have a nice family.
-Congratulations. -Thanks, man.
-We'll clear the road for you. -Thanks.
Sorry to scare you, miss!
Bye, kids! Welcome to Prosperidad!
-Thanks, Beto! -Well, giddy up!
Come on.
Here we go.
See ya!
Look, children. We've arrived in Prosperidad.
-How about a photo? -Yes!
This can't be right. I don't have service!
My cell phone doesn't either, and it's newer than yours.
Mine either, but listen.
I'm sure this is going to be an unforgettable experience.
-Let's take a picture. -Okay.
-Make it vertical. -Let's do a boomerang.
-Make it vertical. -Let's do a boomerang. All right.
Ready? One, two… Say cheese!
Cheese!
This isn't like you described. It's a ghost town.
Must be the time of day. I guess folks are napping.
See that place, honey? That's Mapache's house.
See that place, honey? That's Mapache's house. -Don't remind me. -Good morning!
-Don't remind me. -Good morning!
-They don't seem too friendly. -Hey, Dad?
Is this the whole town? Isn't it small?
And ugly.
Believe it or not,
Prosperidad was once Mexico's wealthiest town.
The mountains had so much gold, you could find it lying around.
Yeah, right.
All I see on the street is trash and dog poop.
Look at the donkey.
Human poop?
-Don't look, kids! -Children, please!
Wow, this is such a beautiful thing.
Check this out.
This is one of Prosperidad's most beautiful traditions.
When someone dies, the family parades them all over town,
When someone dies, the family parades them all over town, to a beautiful, old song called "Las Golondrinas."
to a beautiful, old song called "Las Golondrinas."
Judging by the coffin size, they were kids, just like you.
Pancho!
-What? -I said, shut up.
-They're here! -They made it!
Let's go tell Grandpa!
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Grandma!
The rich relatives are here!
LA ESPERANZA MINE They're here!
They're here!
They came!
Fran… What is this?
Pancho Francisco Reyes!
I'm so glad to see you, son!
My dear father!
I'm so glad you came,
I'm so glad you came, because in a couple years we might not be around.
-My beautiful mother. -Praise the Lord!
-My beautiful mother. -Praise the Lord! Oh, son!
My Pancho.
Folks, meet my family.
This is my wife, Mari,
and these cuties are my children.
-Hello. -Toni and Cati.
A white woman to boost the bloodline, son.
-Welcome to our home, ma'am. -Thanks, Don Rosendo.
Nice to meet you, Doña Dolores.
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
Come on, Mariquita. Meet the rest of the family.
Come on, Mariquita. Meet the rest of the family. Oh, Pancho!
This is my eldest son. Rosendo, after me.
Even though he's a big guy, we all call him Rosendito.
What's going on, Rosendito?
You stink of manure. Have you showered since I left?
Fucking Pancho, always running your mouth.
Have you been humping that cow?
Pervert.
This religious prude is my daughter Socorro.
The Divine Providence granted me the miracle
of seeing you again in this life, Pancho.
Socorrito, I see you didn't become a nun after all.
This useless, lame, good-for-nothing, who used to be the town teacher
and now thinks he's a poet, is her husband Cruz.
Prosperidad's poet muse.
-Eyes serene, so clear! -All right, enough.
This is my son, Hilario, the artist in the family.
-Nice to meet you. -And this girl…
-What was your name, again? -Pánfila, Don Rosendo.
You forgot again? Pánfila Lucía Margarita Pérez Hernández,
You forgot again? Pánfila Lucía Margarita Pérez Hernández, and now Reyes, at your humble service.
and now Reyes, at your humble service.
What's up, Hilario? How have you been?
You couldn't find anyone younger, fucker?
The perks of being the town's most famous artist.
How are you, kiddo?
This gangster-looking boy is my son, Rufino.
The black sheep of the family.
And this busty little minx is his current girlfriend,
And this busty little minx is his current girlfriend, Gloria.
'Sup, lady.
Pleasure to meet you.
You're hotter than I thought, sis.
Thank you.
Rufino, look at yourself. You look like a druglord.
Come on, Pancho. Life isn't fair.
We can't all be as lucky as you.
Here, we do what we can, not what we want.
Give me a hug, man!
-It's good to see you. -Come here, bro.
Come on.
I'm Gloria López, but call me "Culichi."
-Pancho! -Welcome back.
-At your service. -Same here.
How should I explain this mess?
This lady used to be my son, Jacinto.
One day, to the family's shame and dishonor,
she decided she wasn't a man and became Jacinta.
Did I explain that right?
Nice to meet you, sis. Sorry about Dad's nonsense.
Rosendo is your typical Mexican macho.
Oh, Pancho!
Look at how handsome you turned out!
I suppose you're surprised, but it's not contagious.
Jacinto, I can't believe you've done this.
You were always weird, even as a kid.
Jacinta, even if it takes you a second longer.
Hang on, meet my hubby.
-Lupe! -Yeah.
-Nice to meet you. -Guadalupe Flores, at your service.
-Good to meet you, ma'am. -Nice to meet you.
And this one here is my daughter Bartola.
The only good one in the family.
Although, to be honest, she's not too bright.
The idiot has six children with six different men,
including a black one and an Asian one.
This latest one was a gringo who didn't even speak Spanish,
but I guess you didn't do much talking, huh?
Look at you! You were a baby when I left.
You're all grown up now!
So, which one of these is your husband?
-Oh, Pancho! -What?
As soon as Billy found out I was pregnant,
he left without saying goodbye!
-Oh, sister. -Anyway.
Those are Brayan, Yaroslavi, Dudinka, Reagan,
and a bunch I don't know, but they're all my grandkids.
All right, family, this goes to everyone.
This is Mari, my beloved wife,
and these are my kids, Toni and Cati.
-Hi, everyone. -That's Lupita.
She helps around the house and decided to join us.
Is she your servant?
Dad, that word is outdated. She's a domestic worker.
-Are you banging her? -Don't say such things, Dad!
Where's my hello, Panchito?
Have you forgotten about your fucking grandma? Ungrateful bastard!
Grandma Pascuala!
What a nice surprise!
Of course you're surprised, you little shit.
You probably thought I was gone, right?
I wouldn't dare, Grandma!
Look, meet my family.
These are my wife and my children.
-Hi, there. -Cute family, fucker.
You're so lucky your kids came out looking white.
But you're still a bastard
for abandoning us all these years.
Come closer, yes.
I have a feeling they're not yours.
Pancho, why don't we take you to your room?
You must be tired, let's go.
I'll see you later. I'm glad you haven't changed.
-All right, your majesty. -Come on.
I hope you and this woman wouldn't dare
I hope you and this woman wouldn't dare to show up here empty-handed.
I hope you brought me a nice gift, at least.
Yes.
Just a little something from all of us.
-They're Fendi. -Nice save.
Now we're talking!
You look great, Mom. -I know, right? -Let's go.
-I know, right? -Let's go.
Let's see your grandpa first, so he knows you're here.
Let's see your grandpa first, so he knows you're here. Come on, everyone! We put him in this room.
Come on, everyone! We put him in this room.
Come right in.
Don't you think your mom and sisters did a great job?
He's starting to smell,
but we had to honor his will to have you at his funeral.
Now that you're here with your family,
the old man will finally rest in peace.
You'll have a chance to be alone with him, and pray for him.
Give him a kiss, son!
Let's go to your room. Follow me.
Come on, son.
Don't! You will break it!
No! get out young man, get out of the car please!
Come in.
Get out of here! -Outside, quick! -Get out!
We're putting you in Grandpa's room. It's the best one in the house.
It's not a luxury hotel, but we set it up with love.
The sheets are fresh from the laundry.
Here is some soap, a few towels,
and nice clean water for you to freshen up.
-Do you like it, son? -It's not bad for a couple nights.
-Do you like it, son? -It's not bad for a couple nights. Right, honey?
Don't worry about us. Since you're both here,
we got you something, I hope you like it.
-What's this? -It's a tie, Hermès.
A tie! Just what I needed!
Chanel No. 5, the classic.
If you don't like them, Mari can exchange them.
No, Pancho, I can't. Maybe you should've bought them yourself.
We'll let you get settled.
-Let's go. -Thanks, Dad.
-What's that? -Rest up, son.
-What's that? -Rest up, son. -Mom, it's a leg. -Great-grandpa's leg.
-Mom, it's a leg. -Great-grandpa's leg.
What?
Pancho!
-Have you seen…? -Oh, I almost forgot!
Later today, we're having a little welcome party,
to celebrate your homecoming.
Don't let us down.
We'll be there, Dad. Thank you.
-Come on, honey. -All right.
You don't expect us to stay here, do you?
Not only is this place filthy, it's your dead grandpa's room!
That's his leg. This is a nightmare!
Should we book a room in the village Hilton?
Didn't you hear they're throwing us a party?
Sorry, but I can't insult my family like that.
Yes, but this is a dump!
-It smells like poor people! -Listen, María Elena.
I told you I came from a humble family, and you always said you didn't mind.
Also, don't you forget I know exactly how your white-trash parents made their money.
So, please spare me the aristocrat routine.
Come on, honey. Don't be silly, stop crying.
Everything will be okay. It's only a couple days, I promise.
Pancho, it's just…
I'm sorry for all that stuff I said about your family,
but this is even worse than my worst nightmare.
I need to tell you something but don't get mad.
-What is it, champ? -I need a bathroom.
-So do I. -Number one, or two?
-Poop, maybe the squirts. -Me too!
Hurry, come with me before it's too late. -Run, run! -Oh God, me too!
All right, kids.
Go that way, pick a tree,
pull your pants down, and watch out for bugs.
I'll get you toilet paper. Hurry, guys.
-What, here?! -Yes, here.
Pancho, are you telling me there's no bathroom?
There's an outhouse, but trust me, this is better.
Well, since I'm here.
-How you doing, kids? -Fine!
Good.
Let's hear it, family!
Thanks, Dad!
Pancho, welcome again. Here's to you.
Thanks, Dad. Cheers.
Thanks, Dad. Cheers. Thank you for this party, you went all-out.
Thank you for this party, you went all-out.
Cheers!
You and your family deserve nothing less.
Really, we're all so happy to have you here.
Hang on, Hilario! Wait a minute. Hold it, guys.
Wait just a second, I have a few words to say.
Kids, get over here!
Hey there, little guy!
My dear family.
This is a very special day for your mother and me.
Seeing all of you together, but especially,
having my son Pancho and his family with us,
is more than I've ever dared to dream.
Please don't take this the wrong way,
but Pancho has always been my favorite,
and without a doubt the best of you lot.
Cheers, son. Cheers, Mariquita.
One more time, welcome to Prosperidad.
-Cheers, everyone! -Cheers!
Say something, son! Don't be shy.
No way, no.
-Yeah, come on! -Speech! Speech!
Do it, Dad!
First, I'd like to thank you for your kind welcome.
After so many years,
my family and I are ecstatic to be with all of you right here in Prosperidad.
In order to keep this short,
let me tell you something from the heart.
This goes especially to mom and dad.
I hope you can forgive me for not coming sooner,
and for abandoning you all this time.
I'm sorry.
-Cheers. -Very nice, Pancho!
Still, we're only staying for a couple of days.
We have to get back to the capital soon, right? -Yes, honey. -Don't worry, son.
-Yes, honey. -Don't worry, son.
First thing tomorrow, we'll bury him.
Afterwards, we'll all get together including your uncles,
and have the notary read the will.
Sounds great. Grandma Pascuala,
Sounds great. Grandma Pascuala, How are my uncles, Regino and Ambrosio?
I wish they were dead.
Unfortunately, those asswipes are still a waste of oxygen.
I wish you would've invited them, Dad.
No way. I'd rather die than let those pricks set foot in this house.
Quiet, Rosendo!
I'm not surprised to see Dolores, the slut,
coming to the defense of her boyfriend.
Shut up, Doña Pascuala! Always stirring the pot with your lies, old hag!
Always stirring the pot with your lies, old hag!
Don't disrespect my mother! What she said is true.
Everyone knows you were whoring around with Regino.
Your mother's the whore, you piece of shit!
Stop her! Come on!
Play something, boys!
It's your song, Mom!
Ready? One, two..! -Come on, Cati! -One, two, here we go!
Beat the shit out of this fucking gringo!
Teach him to respect us Mexicans, Cati!
-All right, ready? -Come on!
Stop that, sis. Put that down.
Try this, I made it for you with all my love.
-What is it, Rufino? -It's called Nenepil Norteño.
You won't find a better one anywhere but Prosperidad.
-Is it very spicy? -If you don't like it, spit it out.
Forget about manners, we're all family.
What do you think?
-It's delish! -Delish.
-What is it called? -Nenepil Norteño.
Next, I'll make you one with fried chitterlings.
I'll show you how the local meat is nothing to frown upon.
But first, let me get you another tequila.
Pancho, what's in Nenepil Norteño?
Don't ask, honey.
It's delish, I loved it. What's in it?
Fine, but I did warn you.
Nenepil is made from the guts, liver, uterus,
Nenepil is made from the guts, liver, uterus, and stomach of the pig, cooked in salsa.
and stomach of the pig, cooked in salsa. It's a local delicacy.
-Delicious. -Sis!
Another tequila? There you go!
-Pour me some. -Do you have any lime?
Who wants tequila?
Cheers, boys! Take a quick break.
Don't be snotty! Come dance!
Come dance with us, it's a great song.
I'm not taking no for an answer. Let's do this!
Bravo!
Let's take a family picture!
Let's take a family picture! -Gather around. -Wait, I'll go get Grandma.
Come with me, Mom. We're taking a picture.
I'm not doing that nonsense!
-Yes, you are. -Come on, Grandma!
Fucking bullshit!
-Make room for Grandma. -Don't push me around!
Say cheese on three. One, two, three.
Cheese!
Pancho, wait up!
Get in there, I'll take another one so you're also in the picture.
-Thanks, bro. Make it vertical. -Sister.
Say cheese on three.
-Cheese! -On three, guys.
One… two…
I spy Rosendito and Lupita kissing on a tree!
Get out of here, brats!
Go on, scram!
The best thing I ever did was leave this one-horse town,
The best thing I ever did was leave this one-horse town, and move to the capital.
Panchito, is it as nice as people say?
If we could get rid of all the people there,
Mexico City would be the nicest place in the world.
Would you take me there and show me around?
-Well, I… -Would you?
If we ever get a chance, I'll show you anything.
Kids, it's time for bed. Go to your rooms.
No!
I'll go get the belt, then. I'm not joking around.
Come on, quickly!
Go to sleep!
Night, Rosendito.
Why don't we take this somewhere more private?
-I love a good secret. -Me too! Let's go.
Good night.
Oh, come on.
-Here you go. -Yes?
-One last drink. -No.
What do you mean it's 15,000 pesos for some pig meat and seasoned turkey?
You're kidding me, Don Pancracio!
Plus, one whole lamb, nine pounds of Nenepil.
Plus, one whole lamb, nine pounds of Nenepil. six pounds of cracklings, ten pounds of guacamole.
Plus, a barrel of pulque, twenty cases of beer,
Plus, a barrel of pulque, twenty cases of beer, and ten bottles of tequila.
Then, there's the tent, the lights, and the chairs.
Then, there's the tent, the lights, and the chairs. Give me a break, Don Rosendo!
Let me see if my children can chip in, I'll be back.
Excuse me, Dad?
Can we add the boys' fee to the party tab?
-You said it was your treat! -Only the first three songs.
We owe them for the rest. See how angry they look?
It's only 7,000 pesos.
-I'll see what I can do. -All right, Dad.
Come on, honey.
Look at these!
Look at these! That's right. Get in there, just dive in.
Sorry to interrupt.
Can we talk with you for a moment?
Of course, Dad, certainly. Good evening, ma'am.
Of course, Dad, certainly. Good evening, ma'am. All right, then.
-What's up, Dad? -Son, we're sorry to ask,
but even after everyone chipped in,
we don't have enough to pay for the party.
Sure, no worries. How much?
Everything, including music, comes to $25,000 pesos.
-How much do you have? -After dipping into our savings,
we're still short almost by half.
Dad, that's pretty steep for a house party.
Let me see.
I'll take this.
If there's anything left, I'll bring it back to you.
Let's go, honey.
All right.
This is the last one, for real.
I have a question, sis.
Are those killer tits and ass wholly natural, or is that surgery?
My boobs, my ass, and my hair.
-Everything natural. -I'd kill for that body.
-Same. -Lupe!
My brother mentioned you were pretty,
but the bastard didn't say this much. Hot damn! You're drop-dead gorgeous!
Hot damn! You're drop-dead gorgeous!
I'm going to bed.
-Come on, stay a while. -Excuse me.
If she's leaving, let's call it a night.
-I'm calling it a night. -Party's over.
-You spilled my tequila! -Stubborn old drunks.
One more drink, a poem for everyone!
O Sweet Land! Your surface is the gold of maize.
Your mines, the palace of the King of Gold.
Herons gliding across the skies,
and the green flash of the parrots!
-And some other-- -Hey, you.
Tell your idiot husband to shut the fuck up,
and find me some of that barbacoa meat.
-I want one more taquito. -Sure, Grandma.
I keep thinking about the way your parents talk.
And the fat mariachis!
And how your brother Rufino wouldn't stop flirting with me.
Your sisters treat me like the Princess of Monaco.
See? Not everyone is as lucky as we are.
Do you know who is the luckiest guy in the whole wide world?
Who, honey?
-Do you want it? -Yes, please.
Don't wake the kids, hurry up.
Move over.
-Here it comes. -Hurry.
Keep it down.
-Pancho! -What?
-Someone's spying on us! -It's too dark outside.
Run!
Sons of bitches.
All these years and they haven't changed.
Fuck you!
What happened?
Who was it? Oh, no!
Relax, honey. It was only my nephews, they didn't see much.
-Oh, okay. -Don't worry.
Where were we?
You were about to fuck me with those muscles.
-These muscles, sexy? -Oh, yes!
Oh, that's good.
Keep it down, Pancho.
Dad, can you tell me what's "Moctezuma's revenge"?
It's what happens to gringos when they visit Mexico.
-Why, champ? -I know I'm not a gringo,
-Why, champ? -I know I'm not a gringo, -But I think I got it. -Me too.
-But I think I got it. -Me too.
Oh, man. Hurry up!
Come on, hurry.
I think I got it, too.
We're going with Socorro if it's a girl.
If it's a boy, Jacinto.
What the hell?
-Life's so unfair, man. -Why?
How is it that Pancho is doing so well,
while we get fucked day in and day out?
I wonder what Pancho's wife thought about us.
Easy. That we're lowlifes without class or manners.
And she'd be right, it's the truth.
Judging by their SUV, his watch, and those outfits,
Judging by their SUV, his watch, and those outfits, they're rolling in it.
Imagine the palace they must live in.
Did you see the jewelry on that stuck-up bitch?
Those earrings, that watch, the necklace, the bracelet.
I know these things,
she was probably wearing around $100,000 pesos.
And her scent, Gloria. French perfume.
Well, that doesn't make them any less sinful or indecent.
Tell me, Jacinto… Sorry, I meant Jacinta!
How much is Pancho worth? Just a ballpark guess.
I don't know, but a lot. Maybe a million dollars?
Don't be stupid!
If he had a million dollars,
why would he come to this town full of thieves?
Who cares how loaded my brother is?
It's up to us to make sure we get some of it, right?
-Cheers! -Cheers to that, bro!
Oh, look.
Uncle Ambrosio!
Good to see you, how are you?
Fine, my son.
Meet my wife, Mari, and my children.
-Nice to meet you, my child. -Likewise, Father Ambrosio.
Cute children.
-I hope they're baptized. -Of course they are.
In fact, Toni is getting ready for his First Communion.
-Right, champ? -Yes, Dad!
What a nice smile.
So you finally decided to come, Panchito.
I'm glad, because if years of abandonment
had doomed your soul to Purgatory,
missing your grandpa's funeral would be your ticket to Hell.
How can you think that? Grandpa always was like a father to me.
Yeah, right.
What brought you here to Prosperidad
was greed for his will, but we'll talk later.
We better get on with the funeral,
before the smell starts attracting the buzzards.
Shall we, pallbearer?
-Pallbearer? -What?
-Good day, everyone. -Good morning.
Fucking sissy.
Ready?
May God take mercy on his soul. Let's go.
The Lord has gathered us on this day
to bid farewell to a great man.
Our dear father and grandfather, Don Francisco Reyes,
is finally at peace and has risen to Heaven
is finally at peace and has risen to Heaven to be with the Lord.
Yet, his memory and example shall live on in our hearts.
A man of integrity, generous, hard-working, and honest.
A good husband, and a better father and grandfather.
May his legacy be a light to us all.
-A beacon in our path-- -Listen up, Ambrosio.
Cut the bullshit and get on with it.
Your father was a miserable son of a bitch.
So, wrap it up already because it's getting hot.
I'm sorry, mother. Let us pray.
For fuck's sake.
Here comes the hurdle.
The last thing we needed was him and his tramp.
-I'll give him a piece of my mind. -Calm down, Rosendo!
Francisco was his father, too.
Don't make a scene at his funeral.
Mommy! -Godson. -Hi, there.
-Godson. -Hi, there.
Excuse you.
I'm sorry I couldn't come sooner.
I can't tell you how upset I was when I heard the news,
or how much I've cried since then.
Spare me your lies, you shameless bastard.
Your father was sick for a long time, and he's been dead for three days,
yet you never visited him or paid your respects.
Stop being a hypocrite.
I need you, your floozy, and that tumor you call a son
to start praying like the rest of us,
so we can be done with this bullshit,
and we can get to the reading of the will.
Yes, mother. My apologies, again.
I'm so sorry. Really sorry, Granny.
I was also very upset at Grandpa's death.
Get out of my face, you hemorrhoid!
Let us proceed.
Good afternoon, everyone.
Afternoon, counselor.
In accordance with Don Francisco's final wishes,
I will commence reading his will.
In the town of Prosperidad, of the same municipality,
In the town of Prosperidad, of the same municipality, Don Francisco Reyes Vargas appears before me.
He declares he is Mexican by birth,
miner by trade,
and a citizen of this municipality,
where he was born on the 21st of April, 1897.
Being of sound mind and body,
and expecting you've honored his last wish
of having all his family present for this solemn occasion,
he manifests and declares the following testament.
To his great-grandchildren, great-great-grandchildren,
and further descendants, whose name he doesn't know,
he hereby bequeaths a 20-peso coin each,
in the hope that, by investing it wisely,
they will forge their own path through life.
Eat shit! Eat shit!
Everyone out!
To his dear grandchildren,
Rosendito, Hilario,
Socorro,
Rufino,
Jacinto, or Jacinta, as she likes to be called,
Reginito, and Bartola,
he hereby passes on his donkey, his cow,
he hereby passes on his donkey, his cow, his turkey, and his three pigs,
his turkey, and his three pigs,
so they can split them however they see fit.
To his daughter-in-law Dolores García,
in appreciation for one memorable night of passion,
he passes on his precious Virgin of Guadalupe medal.
To his son Ambrosio,
who, as a good Christian, and representative of God on Earth,
attributes no value to material goods,
he hereby leaves one Our Father,
and three Hail Marys.
Screw you, Dad.
To his son Regino, who among his children
To his son Regino, who among his children was the only one to lead a successful life,
and realized his dream of becoming
a thieving, corrupt, bloodsucking politician,
he leaves a second-hand, highlighted copy of the Treatise on Morality,
like the ones the government handed out in town.
-Let's go. -To his son Rosendo,
who among the triplets
was the only one who followed his footsteps
and took up mining,
he passes on his pickaxe, his shovel, and his cart,
he passes on his pickaxe, his shovel, and his cart, so he can keep pursuing his ridiculous dream of finding a gold-bearing vein in the old Esperanza mine.
of finding a gold-bearing vein in the old Esperanza mine.
To his beloved companion for so many years,
Doña Pascuala Vargas García,
he passes on nothing less than his deepest gratitude,
and wishes that her time in this world
isn't prolonged for too long so she can soon join him.
Fucking Francisco Reyes!
You were a fucking asshole until the very end!
I hope you rot in hell, you piece of shit!
Say, Mr. Counselor.
If he didn't leave anything to any of us,
who the goddamn fuck is getting the house and all his belongings, according to that asshole?
Allow me, Doña Pascuala, I haven't finished yet.
Lastly, it his his will to appoint as the universal heir
it his his will to appoint as the universal heir
to the rest of his assets,
including the house, the old Esperanza Mine,
with all its tunnels and surrounding land,
as well any movable and immovable assets therein,
as well as the items that over the course of his life,
he dutifully stored in his personal safe,
of which yours truly is appointed guardian, executor, and steward,
to his grandson Francisco,
who among his descendants was the only one
who among his descendants was the only one whose hard work, effort, and dedication--
What the fuck?!
You'll have to excuse me, Mr. Counselor,
but I don't believe a word you just read.
Dad wouldn't have fucked us over and left everything to Pancho!
He hadn't heard from him in over twenty years!
I'm sorry, Don Rosendo!
Those were Don Francisco's last wishes.
Don't blame me,
I'm just the messenger.
Listen up, fuckers!
Leave Mr. Toribio alone!
Knowing that asshole Francisco, I'm sure the will is true.
He hated all of us!
All we can do,
is hope that Panchito takes pity on us
and shares his inheritance with the rest of us.
-More beans, husband? -No, Lola.
I bet these welfare beans from the government
have weevils in them, I always get so gassy.
I'll take some, Mom. I like those critters.
-I want some too, Grandma. -Sorry, that's all we had.
Grandma gave away all the leftovers last night.
You didn't save anything for Pancho and his family?
You didn't invite them to eat with us?
I did, but as soon as they got back,
they went into their room and haven't come out.
What can we feed them? Rancid welfare beans?
Old tortillas?
Your daughter-in-law will have a fit!
What if we slaughter a chicken or a pig?
Are you crazy?! Those are my animals!
I'm saving them for my wife's 15th birthday.
Curse this misery!
How much worse can things get?
For the millionth time, don't be a crybaby.
Act like a man!
We've spent years eating what we can, when we can,
and you've never whined like a little bitch.
Sure, but I hoped that Dad would leave us something
that would turn our luck.
You heard the counselor, the old man had a safe!
He's right, Grandma. I heard him mention a safe.
I heard it, too.
I wonder what's in it. Something valuable, for sure.
Who the fuck cares what's in it?
Probably old documents, some photographs.
Nothing of value,
because I'm sure the old bastard spent every last dime
because I'm sure the old bastard spent every last dime on whores and booze!
I'll say it again. How much worse can it get?
May I?
-Come on in, son! -Excuse me.
-Where are the kids? -They're asleep.
They got sunstroke after the procession.
I'm sorry, son. There's no more food,
but I can send Bartola to fetch some tamales.
Don't worry, Mom. We're still full from the party.
We don't feel so good. Right, Mari?
Are you sure, son?
Doña Pancha's green chili tamales are the best!
-And we have a tab. -That's okay, Dad.
All we came here to say is that we had a long talk,
and we think we understand how you must be feeling.
We think Grandpa was unfair in the way he split his assets.
-More than unfair! -Settle down. Settle down.
Even though I got the house, the mine, and the land,
nothing will change for all of you.
I told you, fuckers!
Pancho is the best son in the world!
Brayan, Dudinka! Go and find Don Pancracio.
Tell him to send us a pig and tequila to celebrate!
Hilario, go get your boys! We'll need music!
-Right away! -Tell him I want lamb!
Also some cracklings, but hold the hair.
-Oh, my God. -Fran, I don't feel good.
It's just a hangover.
Champ, be careful!
Good morning!
-Morning. -Good morning, all.
Morning, sleepyheads. Did you sleep well?
More or less.
-Where's Dad? And my brothers? -They're running errands.
They'll be back later to take you to town.
I'm making you a nice breakfast to cure your hangover.
I'm sure it's a bad one.
I made some menudo, nice and spicy.
Also, some chilaquiles in a three-chili salsa.
I'm sorry, Doña Dolores. I don't feel well, excuse me.
Honey, eat something to settle your stomach!
Doesn't the madame like Mexican food?
Snotty fart-smelling bitch.
That's not it, Grandma.
The food didn't agree with her, she was up all night.
Let's make her some tea with epazote, jimsonweed--
Mom, don't bother.
-Morning, son! -Hi, Dad.
-Ready to go into town? -I'm ready.
Wait, son! Sorry to bother you,
but can you lend me some money to give to Doña Cata
to pay for breakfast and today's lunch?
Panchito. Can I get something for my hemorrhoid cream,
and for my cigarettes?
Thank you!
-I'll keep it safe for you. -No.
Son, pull over for a second.
-Here? -Yes, here. Come.
Look, son. All this is now yours.
How far do the lands extend?
-See the house? -Yeah.
The property line starts here where the cross is,
and it ends all the way at the bottom of the mountains.
How come you never grew crops, or raised cattle to put it to some use?
Son, clearly you've spent too long in the city.
All that grows here is a few desert plants, some prickly plants, and bitterness.
The only animals are black snakes, spiders,
and venomous scorpions, isn't that right, Rosendito?
If you and my brothers weren't so lazy,
you would've used this land to get ahead.
See? It's the same as when I left.
No, Pancho.
We haven't been lazying around. Isn't that right, Rosendito?
We work from sunrise to sundown every day.
I can prove it. We have a surprise for you.
Remember the old mine?
How could I forget the Refugio tunnel.
I spent my entire childhood helping Grandpa.
He used to bring you out here every Saturday.
Well, you own it now.
We've been coming here every third day.
We've been making surveys, cleaning up, and drawing up plans.
Open the gate, son.
The thing is that, for the longest time,
Grandpa Francisco, Rosendito, and myself,
we've been making plans to open it up again.
Believe it or not,
I'm sure that behind those rocks,
hides the world's largest gold-bearing vein.
-Right, Rosendito? -You said it, Pops!
Dad, forget about those old dreams.
Dad, forget about those old dreams. According to Grandpa, who knew more than anyone,
According to Grandpa, who knew more than anyone,
the gold in this mine was emptied years ago.
No way, son!
Even the fucking gringos and the Canadians
have been coming around to check it out.
Like a bunch of blond-haired vultures!
What are you talking about? Listen.
What are you talking about? Listen. As far back as I can remember, you've clung to this fantasy.
As far back as I can remember, you've clung to this fantasy.
And, look! Twenty years later, and your laziness has kept everything the same.
I needed a partner and money to get it going!
But now that you're rich and came back,
We can finally do it!
Listen to me, Dad. Don't take this wrong,
but I'm only back in town for a couple days
to see about the will and attend the funeral,
so I better hurry along if I want to sort everything out.
Why don't we get to town so I can sort things out
Why don't we get to town so I can sort things out with the counselor and my godfather?
-What do you say? -Sure, son.
Promise me you'll think about the mine.
I swear we could make billions off of this!
All right, then. I promise to think about it.
All right, then. I promise to think about it. Come on, let's go.
BIENESTAR BANK
Wish me luck, Dad. I'll see you at the cantina.
-I'll tell you how it went. -All right, son.
-I'll tell you how it went. -All right, son. Don't let that asshole Regino push you around.
He sure loves his bribes and backroom deals.
Be careful, brother. Keep an eye on your wallet.
-See you later. -All right.
-Good morning. -Morning.
-I'm looking for Mayor Reyes. -Through there.
-I'm looking for Mayor Reyes. -Through there. Thanks.
-Good morning. -Morning.
Good day, I'd like to see Don Regino Reyes.
-Is he expecting you? -Unfortunately, no.
-Is he expecting you? -Unfortunately, no. I'm his nephew, I was hoping he'd see me.
I'm his nephew, I was hoping he'd see me.
Are you the mayor's relative, the one from the capital?
The one who got Don Francisco's inheritance?
Francisco Reyes, at your service.
News sure seem to spread like wildfire in this town.
Oh, sir.
I'm sorry, but the mayor is a very busy man.
Still, seeing as it's you, I'll ask Commander Reyes.
-He's in charge of his schedule. -I really appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
What's up, Reginito? Don't you remember me?
I'm your cousin Pancho!
I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to talk yesterday.
What's up, Pancho? Did you only come back for the inheritance?
Don't be silly, that's not the reason.
Reginito, do you think I can see my godfather?
First of all, don't call me Reginito. It's Commander Reyes, got it?
Sorry, but the mayor can't see you without an appointment.
I understand, Commander. Can you tell him I'm here?
I just want to check the paperwork for the house.
No can do.
I'll check his schedule to pencil you in for next week.
Meanwhile, take a seat. I have a lot of work to do.
Thanks a lot.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Take this to pass the time. It's going to be a long wait.
Thanks, doll. I appreciate your help with those gringos.
I'll drop by later tonight for another English lesson.
Bye, honey.
My dearest godson! I'm so glad to see you.
Same here, godfather.
-Why were you sitting there? -I was hoping to see you.
-How's the town treating you? -Just fine.
-How's the town treating you? -Just fine. You know how things work in Prosperidad.
Did this asshole tell you you couldn't come in?
No, not at all.
I'm in a bit of a rush, I only have a couple days
to sort out the house and the inheritance.
Listen up, Reginito! Get this through your head.
Pancho here is like a son to me, and he's free to walk in, got it?
Of course, Dad!
I've told you over an over not to call me Dad here.
You'll get me accused of nepotism. Get lost, check what's out there.
Make sure no one bothers me so I can talk to my godson.
-Come on in. -Later, Commander.
Couldn't be more corrupt!
They only admit gringos and rich guys with connections.
-Have a seat, Godson. -Thanks.
What have you been up to all this time?
Well, things were rocky for a bit when I first got to Mexico City.
You know how shitty those city folks can be.
They treated me like garbage.
Things started to turn around once I graduated,
Things started to turn around once I graduated, found myself a job, and got married.
found myself a job, and got married. I have two wonderful kids.
So, now I'm here, back in Prosperidad.
I see that you switched political parties.
Oh, son. Times have changed.
PRI no longer serves this country.
The party was ruined by corruption and impunity.
Then I tried PAN, but it was the same thing, except they're also God-fearing hypocrites.
And today, at the hands of our President,
the country is undergoing its fourth transformation.
Things are better than ever! And he's magically put an end to corruption and impunity.
And he's magically put an end to corruption and impunity.
Now, I guess you're here and very happy,
because of your grandfather's inheritance.
Honestly, besides coming to visit you,
I was hoping you could help with the paperwork for the house,
and to get in touch with the notary to get my stuff.
Don't worry about all that, I'll gladly help you.
-Thank you so much. -However,
before you can take possession and put everything in your name,
you need to be up to date with all the property's expenses, settle the mortgage, and any outstanding utility bills.
settle the mortgage, and any outstanding utility bills.
How much are we talking about?
That doesn't include interest or late-payment fees.
Your family hasn't paid bills or property tax for years.
What? Is it too much?
I'm not sure the house and land are even worth this much.
Is there any way we can come to an arrangement?
Francisco, damn it!
I just told you the President put an end to corruption!
Check this out. Educate yourself.
Plus, you can drop the act. I can tell you're rich.
Anyway, you've always known you're my favorite nephew.
That's why I'm going to help you.
Really, Godfather? How?
-I'll give you two options. -Lay 'em on me.
First option, you settle the debt in a single payment,
and I'll waive the interest and the surcharges.
What's the second one?
-Sell me the property. -What, all of it?
-The house, the mine, the land? -All of it.
Where would that leave my parents and siblings?
Of course, I would let them keep living in the house,
at least until my mother passes away.
After that, those parasites you call your family
will have to figure it out on their own.
Forgive me, Godfather, but I can't do that to them.
Think it over, son. That's all I can do to help.
I'm very interested in buying that property.
Let me think about it. With all due respect, you're putting me in a very awkward position.
You got it. Don't take too long though, the interest is increasing.
You'll have to excuse me, but as you can see,
the country needs me and the noble masses await.
Sure.
Look at this dress! Isn't it pretty?
Do you think she'll mind if I keep it?
She won't even notice, she has so many!
Look, Mom!
This the good stuff, the madame's jewels!
Enough, thieving bitches! Put everything back!
Put that watch down! How dare you steal from me!
-And you, fucking lowborn! -Screw you, cunt!
What did you call me?
THE EAGLE AND THE SNAKE CANTINA
-Cheers, buddy. -Cheers!
Cástulo, get us a bottle and beer for everyone! My son Pancho is treating us!
-Hey, you. -Sit with us, son.
Are you paying their tab? It's over 3,000 pesos already.
-It's fine. -Come on, bring a chair.
Look, my friends. This is my son Francisco,
Look, my friends. This is my son Francisco, the one I've been telling you about.
The best and brightest of the Reyes family.
-Thanks. Hello. -Remember him?
Sure, we met earlier at Regino's office.
Right, that was you.
I didn't know it was Pancho. Welcome back.
So, how did it go with that bastard?
I'm not sure.
It turns out that the property is in a lot of debt,
and I can't take possession until the debt is paid.
That's the typical bullshit from that asshole Regino!
You should've paid it all to shut him up.
That's the thing, Dad.
You haven't paid a dime in so many years--
Never mind that, son. We'll talk later.
I was just telling my buddies you're going to lend me
I was just telling my buddies you're going to lend me the money to reopen the old Esperanza mine.
I heard him say it. I swear to God.
Congrats, Panchito.
I hope you can finally make your dad's dream come true.
Honestly, Don Rosendo,
you're lucky to have such a great son.
Not only good, buddy. He's rich as hell!
And without a doubt, the best of my children.
Gathered around an old cantina table,
we find six to eight men, like a group of hippies!
Here we go!
Come on, son. Tip your brother-in-law.
Also, pay the boys to sing us a few songs.
Fine, Dad.
Cheers, gentlemen!
Stupid Pancho!
There's no service.
Screw this town.
Screw those bitches from hell!
You bitches don't know who you're messing with!
Wait till you see what hot chicks are in my son-in-law's whorehouse.
-Hello, Florcita. -Hi, there.
-Where's my son-in-law and the missus? -They're upstairs.
I'll add the girls to your tab. You can square up with the boss.
All right.
Come on, sweetheart. I'm feeling romantic.
Listen up, girls.
I want you to take care of my son Pancho.
Show him a good time.
Catrina, make sure he's happy because he's paying for this.
-Isn't that right, son? -Sure, Dad.
Why hello, Panchito.
Which one of us tickles your fancy?
Or would you prefer a ménage à trois?
Don't worry, ladies. I'll just wait for those two.
Have a seat, I'll treat you to some tequila while we wait.
Oh, Panchito! such a party pooper.
It's like you're not one of the Reyes.
Yes, thankfully.
Have a seat.
Manuela, bring some beer!
Stop crying, baby.
Those big, beautiful eyes are going to get puffy.
I assure you that my girl meant nothing by it.
No one had ever called me something so awful, Rufino.
Besides, Pancho left early this morning,
and I think he's forgotten all about us.
Come on, now. Have some more tequila.
Drink this, and look, forget about Pancho.
He probably ran into an ex and is having some fun.
You think Pancho is capable of cheating on me, Rufino?
Jeez.
I don't know if my bro is still a player,
but when he was young, that son of a bitch slept with every single girl in town.
that son of a bitch slept with every single girl in town.
Oh, no!
Hey, hey.
None of them were as beautiful as you.
None of them had such pretty eyes.
-What? -Yeah.
-Or such a smoking body. -Do you mean it, Rufino?
Do you really think I'm beautiful?
Like an angel.
Not like an angel.
You're more beautiful than the Virgin Mary.
Oh, Rufino.
Sure, I can get you a job at a strip club in the city. It's a classy joint.
Fucking Jacinta!
I told you, clients can't leave without paying first!
Stop hitting me, Lupe!
He said he was taking a leak, but he climbed out the window.
I'm not buying it!
You're a common slut who flirts with every guy who walks in!
Take this!
-You bitch! -Are you okay, bro?
You listen to me, Lupe.
That's no way of treating my brother, back off!
Is that so?
Turns out the little lord has some balls after all!
I can throw a punch. Come at me, then!
I thought you had balls! Let's see if you can dance.
Enough, Guadalupe! Don't be such a beast.
Pancho is going to think we're a bunch of animals.
Look, why don't I get you a nice shot of tequila,
so you can settle down and drink with old friends?
-How's that? -All right.
-Thanks, bro. -Sorry about that.
If I'm not tough on them, the business is fucked.
No worries, Lupe. No big deal.
-Cheers, then. -Cheers.
Cheers bro.
Enough about this.
But listen to me, though. Just so we're good,
I think you should pay for the drinks and the girls.
Yes, of course.
What's up, son? Everything good?
-You having fun? -Sure thing, Dad.
That's good, son.
Shit, hold on!
Come on, son.
Let's ask your mother to make us some dinner.
Let's ask your mother to make us some dinner. -We'll sleep better. -I'll catch up.
-We'll sleep better. -I'll catch up. First, I have to check on Mari and the kids.
First, I have to check on Mari and the kids.
I've told you to act like a man, don't be such a wuss.
-That's how you spoil a woman. -I'll be right there.
-That's how you spoil a woman. -I'll be right there. -I'll see you in a sec! -All right, Pancho.
-I'll see you in a sec! -All right, Pancho.
-Who is it? -Who else, my love?
-Who is it? -Who else, my love? It's me, Pancho. Your husband.
-Open up, María Elena. -I'm coming.
-Pancho! -What's with that stick?
-Pancho! -What's with that stick? We have to leave this place. I had the worst day.
We have to leave this place. I had the worst day.
I hate your family more each day.
Honey, what's wrong?
Your mom poisoned me with some tea and I was passed out all day.
Then, the women came in to steal what they could.
They touched all my stuff and I was so angry
that I got in a fight with that slut Gloria!
-What do you--? -Pancho!
There's something else I don't want the kids to hear.
-Oh, Pancho… -What is it?
Your brother Rufino came into our room
and tried to force himself on me.
Honey, honey. You're drinking too much.
I think it's the booze because hear me out.
I think it's the booze because hear me out. My family might not have the best manners,
but stealing, poisoning, and seducing you by force?
I'm sorry, but that's not who they are.
You're wrong, Dad! Mom is right.
Our cousins stole and broke our iPads.
It's true! Those rude kids cut my doll's head off.
Look!
They tore up my teddy bear!
Oh, my goodness.
I'll have a serious talk with them. This is completely unacceptable.
My family is sick of you. They're scared.
No one here would ever hurt your family!
We're so happy you're here! Isn't that right, everyone?
-Yes, of course. -So happy.
I have to believe Mari and my kids.
It's probably a culture clash.
Your wife and children are rich and spoiled,
they're not used to our country ways!
I'm sorry to be blunt,
but your wife has a serious drinking problem.
-She's drinking like a fish! -Wait, Mom.
-She's drinking like a fish! -Wait, Mom. I've been married to her for 15 years!
In all that time, she's never been drunk.
Let me be clear, as soon as I sort things out with the notary,
hopefully tomorrow, I'm going back to the city! Do you hear me?
Mr. Panchito, this is so hard for me,
but before you go back, I need to ask you a favor.
-What is it? -See, Hilario and I,
-What is it? -See, Hilario and I, we want you and Mrs. Mari to be the godparents to our kid.
we want you and Mrs. Mari to be the godparents to our kid.
Are you crazy, Pánfila?
If anything, Panchito will be the godfather to my twins.
Both of you are fucking delusional.
I spoke with Uncle Ambrosio and reserved the church,
I spoke with Uncle Ambrosio and reserved the church, so that Pancho can baptize my kids.
Quiet, you shrews! Don't talk to my wife like that!
Besides, Pancho agreed to produce my album.
Can you buy me a few cows first?
Screw that! Lupe and I need money to hire more girls for the brothel. -Pancho promised already. -Over my dead body!
-Pancho promised already. -Over my dead body! He's lending us the money for a truck and a real gun. -Put that down! -It's fake!
-Put that down! -It's fake!
For fuck's sake!
If you can't be civil about this, you can all fuck off.
Thanks, Dad.
You're acting like vultures, circling a carcass.
Pancho is only helping me to open the old mine back up.
-He already promised, didn't you, son? -What did you say, Dad?
-He already promised, didn't you, son? -What did you say, Dad? Fucking Panchito! Don't be a fucking moron.
Fucking Panchito! Don't be a fucking moron.
Tell everyone to fuck off.
If you were any smarter, you'd leave this very night.
If you don't, before you know it,
this sorry group of bloodsucking pests
will take the fucking clothes right off your back!
-Ignore her, she has dementia. -Grandma Pascuala is right.
I made a huge mistake coming back here.
I'm leaving! I'm fucking leaving!
I told you, fuckers.
I hope we didn't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.
-We're finally home. -Thank God, Fran.
I thought we'd never leave that goddamned town.
I hear you, honey. We're never going back,
and we'll never have to see my dreadful family again.
Surprise!
What's up, Pancho? What took you so long?
I hope you don't mind, but we felt like
making a nice lunch to welcome you, sit down.
Praise the Lord you got home safe!
You see, Panchito?
I told you you'd never get rid of us, fucker!
-Fran? Fran! -No! What?
Wake up! There's a police car outside. I'm too afraid to go out.
-Go see what they want. -All right.
Oh, my goodness.
What's going on? What's all this fuss about?
Sorry to bother you so late, but…
Sorry to bother you so late, but… -We really need your help! -What happened?
-We really need your help! -What happened?
They caught that idiot Rufino selling drugs in the square,
and your cousin Reginito wants to put him in jail.
Panchito, the trouble is this is his sixth offense.
That orangutan wants to take him to a federal prison.
If he does, no amount of gold will be enough to get him out.
Let me talk to Reginito. Give me a fucking break.
God bless you, son! God bless you!
I'll be right back, honey. You're such a good man, bro.
You're such a good man, bro.
He's a hard-working man, what's the charge? Evening, Commander.
What's up, Pancho? Did your parents tell you what your brother did?
Yes, they did. That's why I'm here.
Yes, they did. That's why I'm here. Is there any way we can get all this cleared up?
Look, Pancho. Your brother's been charged with very serious crimes.
I can't cut him loose for less than ten grand.
Brother! My soul brother! You're such a good man,
pay him what he wants, I promise to pay you back.
I only have three grand, so it's up to you.
-Take it or leave it. -Damn it, Pancho.
You take advantage of me because we're relatives.
Fine, let him out.
Thank you, bro.
Seriously, thank you. You're an angel, man.
I promise to pay you back. I'll give you double! Double!
Come on, boys!
MUNICIPAL POLICE
Morning, sleepyhead. Why so late, huh?
What do you mean?
It was you guys who didn't let me sleep.
Let me make you some breakfast.
Huevos rancheros? Chilaquiles?
I don't want anything. Tell this to the others,
I ask nothing of you, so you ask nothing of me.
Once I settle the papers with the notary,
I'm leaving forever, did you hear me?
Morning, son!
What's gotten into him?
I bet it's something he ate.
I have an idea to cheer him up.
Follow me, son.
Sorry, bro! I'm so embarrassed.
-I didn't know you were here. -Don't worry, I'm almost done.
So, listen.
We're so very grateful for what you did last night.
Rufino and I would like to show you our gratitude.
Don't worry, with some luck, he'll pay me back one day.
Why wait?
Rufino sent me to give you an advance.
-Oh, my God. -You like?
Well, fuck it. It's the only payment I'm going to get.
Come here.
-Come on, do it! -Hold on. Hurry.
Yes, yes!
Just like that! Give it to me.
What is it, honey?
Can't you go to him? We've been waiting all day.
Go where, exactly?
It's going to get dark, and the roads aren't safe.
Remember your friend Mapache and his men?
-I'll be waiting. -Okay.
There he is! That's him pulling in.
Kids, get your things. Help me with the luggage, Lupita.
The safe is here!
-Lupita… -What's that?
Afternoon, Mr. Reyes.
Good afternoon, sir. I'm glad you finally made it.
Sorry about the delay.
To be straight, it's not easy to move this monstrosity.
I see that, it's huge.
-Can I see some ID? -Of course.
Let's see here.
-Here, it's all in order. -Thank you.
Aside from the safe, I'm going to deliver the deed,
as well as a letter Don Francisco left you.
-Is there somewhere we can sit? -You can take the dining room.
No thanks, Dad. We need privacy. -This way, sir. -Boys, unload the safe!
-This way, sir. -Boys, unload the safe!
Have them take the safe into our room, honey.
Have them take the safe into our room, honey. It's too big for the car, but we'll figure it out.
It's too big for the car, but we'll figure it out. -Yeah, okay. -Follow me, sir.
-Yeah, okay. -Follow me, sir.
Gentlemen? Follow me, please.
This way, thanks.
Kids, move.
Rufino, Hilario, Rosendo! Let's give them a hand.
What do you think is in that big safe?
I have no idea, honey, but I won't go to my grave without finding out.
Get out of the way, Cruz! You're not helping!
Maybe we can strap it to the roof of the car?
-The roof would collapse. -Here it comes, guys!
-How will we take it home? -Careful with the boards!
It's barely on the edge.
Come on, Rosendo!
-Thanks, boys. -May I borrow your pen? Thanks.
-Here's the full file. -Thanks.
-Your grandfather's letter. -I appreciate it.
-Your pen. -Right.
I hope you don't mind a piece of advice.
I hope you don't mind a piece of advice. In my experience, it's best that you protect yourself.
In my experience, it's best that you protect yourself.
If you only knew half the stuff I've seen,
or what some families can do over an inheritance,
-you'd take note of my advice. -Thanks, counselor.
I'll leave you to it.
-Excuse me, ma'am. -Go ahead.
-Please! -Clear the way.
Lupita, would you mind giving us a moment?
Lupita, would you mind giving us a moment? -Need a hand, bro? -No, thanks.
-Need a hand, bro? -No, thanks. -Wait, Pancho! -Step back, thank you. Give us a moment.
They're such pests!
Kids, close the windows. Make sure no one sees.
-Watch out, kids. -Sure, Dad.
"Dear Pancho, if you're reading this,
I'm probably dead and burning up in Hell."
"If that bastard Buendía followed my instructions,
you know my whole estate is now yours."
"At this time, you must be standing before the safe."
"Here are the instructions to crack it open."
"Follow them exactly and prepare yourself
"Follow them exactly and prepare yourself for what you are about to find."
Will you help me?
"Left, 42."
"Right, 84."
"Left, 10."
Left, 10.
"Right, 31."
Nothing but trash.
That's trash. Grandpa's leg.
-Oh, God. -It stinks.
Dirty old man.
Give me that.
That's trash.
Grandpa's gun.
How many did he kill? We should keep it safe.
I'll take that.
-Check it out! Some wristwatches… -Wristwatches!
…and his old medals, we could sell all these.
Hear that, Mari?
Fucking Grandpa.
I knew he had something, but I never expected this.
Mari… Mari!
Pancho!
It's beautiful!
Fucking Grandpa!
It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!
How much is this worth?
The coins alone are worth some twenty million pesos,
and the ingots probably 1.5 million each. Mari, we're rich!
Not rich, Pancho. We're millionaires!
We can pay our debt and buy a house, a car.
-We can change our lives. -Not only that, honey.
We can finally change our social status!
Honey! What are they doing?
They're freaking out, the safe was full of gold!
They're putting it back in the safe.
-Are we rich, Dad? -Yes, son! We're rich!
Try to get a count on the ingots.
Twenty or so.
Plus, a bunch of nuggets, maybe two pounds each.
Also, coins! Lots and lots of coins.
Are there enough coins for every one of us?
Most definitely. Enough to go around!
"Anyway, dear Pancho,
I bid you farewell, wishing you the best
and hoping you continue honoring the Reyes name."
"With all my love, Grandpa Francisco."
"P.S. As a token of love and appreciation,
I hope you build me a bigger and better mausoleum
than the one they built for Benito Juárez."
"Be careful with your relatives."
Put it all in the safe. I'll go talk to them.
Pancho's coming! Act natural.
Wait for him to tell us the news himself.
What's going on?
Why do you look so serious?
It's nothing, son. We were just talking.
We're all broken up about how we've been acting,
We're all broken up about how we've been acting, so we wanted to apologize before you leave.
-Right, guys? -Yes.
-You're family. -I'm so sorry, Pancho.
Don't worry, Dad. Time and distance will heal this wound.
So, we're definitely leaving. Tomorrow before dawn.
Son, stay a few more days. I promise we won't bother you.
I'm really sorry, Mom. I've made up my mind.
Believe me, I deeply regret how everything turned out.
Mari and the kids send their love, and thank you for your hospitality.
From the bottom of my heart, thanks for everything.
Thank you, and best regards.
-Uh, son… -Hey, Panchito!
Just so I don't take the curiosity to my grave,
what did you find inside your grandpa's safe?
Just as you guessed, Grandma.
Old letters, photographs,
underpants, a brassiere, and a few trinkets.
Don't worry, I'll leave it open so you can go through it.
Sounds good, dear.
-Safe travels. -Thanks, Grandma.
-God bless, son. -Bye!
-Bye, kids! -Bye!
That two-faced snake!
Just as petty and miserable as his grandfather!
All right, fuckers. So, what?
All right, fuckers. So, what? Are we just going to sit here while Pancho takes our gold?
Are we just going to sit here while Pancho takes our gold?
No!
In that case, let's show him what the Reyes are made of!
-Yeah! -That's right!
Mr. Pancho! Mr. Pancho, come quick!
Your car is burning!
Hurry up, sir!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
-What's going on? -Your car's on fire!
I don't know what happened!
The car! Pancho!
Kids, stay with me.
-Lupita, did you see anything? -No, sir.
-Lupita, did you see anything? -No, sir. I was asleep in the barn. The animals just went crazy.
I was asleep in the barn. The animals just went crazy.
I started smelling smoke, so I went outside
and I saw your car going up in flames. That's when I ran to tell you.
Are you lying to me? Look me in the eye!
I swear I'm not lying!
Motherfuckers!
They'll be sorry for this! I'll put them all in jail!
Mari, check over there. I'll check the house.
Mari, check over there. I'll check the house. -Selfish fucks! -For fuck's sake!
-Selfish fucks! -For fuck's sake!
Get out here! Where are you?
Jealous bums!
-Fuck this shit! -There's no one here. They're gone!
Those bastard are hiding, they're up to something.
-Honey, come with me. -Okay.
Lupita, stay here. If you see anything strange, come get me, quick!
-Fucking run! -Yes!
I'll be right back, sweeties. Don't be afraid.
-Hurry, let's go! -Be careful, sir.
Burning his car was a great idea.
Here's what I'm thinking.
Why don't we kidnap Pancho's children,
and demand the treasure as ransom?
-I could look after the kids. -Don't be stupid, Ambrosio!
If we kidnap my grandkids, they'll know it was us.
We came to you because you know your Bible,
and that thing is full of fucked-up ideas!
We could poison them like Saint Elisha poisoned his sons by the River Jordan.
Or rake them over the coals like Saint Lawrence.
What if we ask Regino? He might have ideas.
Are you crazy, Lola? If Regino finds out about the treasure,
he'll find some way to keep it all to himself.
No matter what we decide, we have to do it today.
With that fortune, Pancho can buy himself a hundred new cars!
Fran, how are we taking this back to Mexico City?
Not only does it weigh a ton,
we can't get on a bus and risk this fortune.
Please, honey. We're not taking a bus.
We have to hide the treasure from those vultures.
-Okay, and then? -Tomorrow,
-Okay, and then? -Tomorrow, we'll go into town, buy a new truck,
we'll go into town, buy a new truck,
retrieve the gold, and go back home.
But, where can we hide it without anyone seeing?
Mari…
Mari, I have a plan.
I'm going to take this, just to be safe.
I feel sorry for any of my piece-of-shit relatives if they try something.
Like Grandpa Francisco would've said,
I'll put a bullet through their skulls.
All right, let's go.
-Lupita. -Yes?
Keep the door locked until we return, got it?
-Yes, sir. -Be good, kids.
Listen to Lupita. Let's go.
I promise you, honey. We're never coming back,
and we won't see my hideous family again.
What if we burn their feet, like Cuauhtémoc?
Would it be in bad taste if we just kill them
and bury them behind the house?
-Don't kill them, Dad! -Not even as a joke, Rufino.
Pancho and his family share our blood.
Anyone who hurts them, will answer to me.
What should we do, then?
You're all a bunch of fools.
We'll settle it the old way, like they did in the Revolution.
We're part of the noble masses,
and we vastly outnumber those stuck-up shits.
We'll go into Pancho's room and take the safe.
If he catches us,
we'll say we just wanted to look at Grandpa's photos,
because we miss him so very much.
-How's that? -Mother, you're a saint.
Oh, Mom!
From here to that dry log, it's exactly 27 steps
heading to that lamp post.
-Are we leaving it here? -Yes, honey.
Seeing as my family lost their minds,
it's best to remove the temptation altogether.
If they burned our car, they're capable of anything.
We're done here. Let's go.
-Are you okay? -Yes.
Are you okay?
What happened here?
He shot me! He really shot me!
Lupe!
Lupe! He shot me in the arm!
Get up, Lupe.
Oh, Mom!
He's dead.
Murderer!
Screw you, Pancho!
You killed my Lupe, you bastard!
You killed my Lupe, you bastard!
Murderer!
Pancho!
Everything will be okay, honey!
Everything will be okay! It's going to be fine!
I'm sorry, Pancho. You're fucked.
No amount of money will get you out of this mess.
They broke into my room! I acted in self-defense.
Remember I already read you your rights,
so anything you say can be used against you.
We'll take your statement in a little while.
We'll take your statement in a little while. No, no… No. No!
One more!
That's enough, let me try again.
You got it, Dad. Put your back into it!
Come on, Dad.
This fucking thing can't be opened.
Have you checked to see if the safe is unlocked?
I told you!
Any other guns in there? Maybe a revolver?
Nothing! Fuck!
I knew Pancho was smarter than the rest of us.
God is punishing us.
That's what we get for being greedy.
So much tragedy!
If the treasure's not here, where did Pancho hide it?
Who knows? And after last night, he'll never tell us.
What now?
We should try to be there for Jacinto, I mean, Jacinta!
They must've released Lupe's body by now.
He shouldn't be alone. I mean, she.
Or they?
-Let's go! -Okay.
Mom, are you coming to the cemetery?
Why would I go to the funeral of that piece of shit?
If there ever was a silver lining.
I say Pancho did us a favor when he killed that pimp.
He clung to this family worse than gonorrhea.
Watch the kids, then.
It's not good for them to see all this drama.
Give Jacinta a hug for me.
Sure thing, Mom! Let's go, everyone.
I swear it was self-defense.
I believe you, Godson.
The thing is that homicide, despite extenuating circumstances,
is fully prosecuted.
-How long will the trial last? -Well, son…
-How long will the trial last? -Well, son… In this town, six to eight months before we get a court date.
In this town, six to eight months before we get a court date.
I see.
If they find me guilty, how much time will I get?
Depends on the judge, son.
In my experience, though,
probably a minimum of three to five years.
Three to five years?
That's not counting the other wounded.
No one will believe it was an accident.
I can't do this. Please, Godfather!
I'm begging you to help me get out of here.
-Godson, you know I love you. -I do.
There's nothing in this country that can't be solved
There's nothing in this country that can't be solved with a lot of money.
How much do you think Grandpa's estate is worth?
Including the contents of the safe.
Did you also hear about Grandpa's treasure?
In this town, there are thieves,
but no secrets.
I know it's a fortune.
Well…
To be honest with you, it's hard to say.
I found some gold nuggets, and some assorted coins.
The full value must be around three, four…
five million.
-Is that it? -Godfather.
-I swear to God. -I'll take your word for it.
Tell your wife, who is waiting outside,
to bring it here as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, I'll pull some strings to see if I can get you out.
The whole treasure?
I thought the President rooted out corruption.
Godson, you insult me!
It's not for me!
There are plenty of people who haven't committed
to the transformation of the country!
I'm going to have to bribe the judge,
I'm going to have to bribe the judge, the district attorney, and the state prosecutor.
By the end, you might end up owing me money.
I'm sorry, Godfather.
I swear I'll give you the whole treasure,
but you need to help me get out of this place.
Very well, then.
Tell your wife to bring it over,
and I'll call in some favors to get you out of here.
-Thank you, Godfather. -God bless.
Watch him.
Fucking hell.
I'll open the gate.
Come on! Try a little!
Do something.
-Pancho! -Pancho…
-You have a visitor. -My love!
-How are you, love? -Honey!
-I'm worried, desperate. -What should we do?
-I'm worried, desperate. -What should we do? Why not hire a lawyer to handle this?
Imagine the kind of lawyer we'll find in Prosperidad.
So, what's the plan?
I have to turn over the gold to Uncle Regino.
-What? -I know. I know.
I don't like it, what if we do it and he keeps you here?
I can't stay in this hellhole for five years, Mari.
We have to risk it.
I hope you're right because I'm not staying here that long.
I know.
Get the shovel and dig out the treasure.
You're only taking out one of the bags.
Leave the rest where it is. This is very important,
be very careful with those vultures.
Pancho!
The rules say no whispering. Cut it out.
-Where are the kids? -Outside, waiting with Lupita.
They wouldn't let them in, visiting hours are over. I mean, please.
-Well, do what I said. -Sure
If you don't take too long, I could get out today.
-Sure, my love. -I love you.
-It's a good plan. -Be careful.
-Please be quick, don't take too long. -No, my love.
Hi, there!
How many years in the can are they giving my murderous grandson?
are they giving my murderous grandson?
Old hag.
Help me, kids. You too, Lupita.
We're taking a few things.
Brayan!
Come here.
-What is it, Grandma? -Go see where they go.
Come on!
…16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21
…16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 22, 23, four, five, six, and seven.
22, 23, four, five, six, and seven.
Facing the lamp post.
I hope this is it.
Give me a hand, Lupita. Bring the pickaxe.
-Yes, ma'am. -Kids!
-Yes, ma'am. -Kids! -Find something to help me. -Yes, Mom!
-Find something to help me. -Yes, Mom!
-What are we looking for? -Don't ask, just help me.
-Your turn. -Yes.
-Here it goes. -That's better.
The soil is too hard.
Try the pickaxe.
-Again? -Yes.
We need to loosen it.
Come here, kids.
Keep going.
Help me find… something.
If we do it, I'll give you one dollar each.
Do it again.
-Hold on. -Keep digging.
You, too.
The madame is going crazy, digging holes everywhere?
I think she's looking for Uncle Pancho's treasure.
Run to the cemetery and tell your grandpa.
Don't let anyone else hear you!
-Run like fuck, son! -Yes, Grandma.
You should all learn from what happened here.
The Lord always works in mysterious ways.
Like with Sodom and Gomorrah, God has punished your greed.
Let us pray.
Hey, Ambrosio! Where's the eulogy?
For that pimp? Who's paying, Rosendo?
You should be grateful I came to pray the rosary.
Oh, Lupe!
-Take me with you! -Girl.
-Take me with you! -Girl. Hey, girl!
Let us fucking pray!
They're digging out the treasure.
Run back. Son? They're looking for the treasure.
Run back. Son? They're looking for the treasure. Hurry up.
-They're getting the treasure. -The treasure!
-What is it, Mom? -It's the treasure!
What's this, now? Where is everyone?
I apologize for my family,
but Mari is supposedly looking for the treasure.
-That's why they left. -Rest in peace, amen.
My daughter, that's all from me. Stay with your man, I have to run. I want to prevent another tragedy!
Stay with your man, I have to run. I want to prevent another tragedy!
-Uncle! -God bless.
See you later, Jacinta. God have mercy!
See you later, Jacinta. God have mercy! -Don't go, girls. -Bartola, help me!
-Don't go, girls. -Bartola, help me!
Wait for us, Uncle!
Baby, I'll be back soon. You know these assholes,
Baby, I'll be back soon. You know these assholes, if I don't hurry up, they'll take it all.
In the name of the cross.
Wait for me!
What's this, Mariquita?
Can we help?
Oh, Don Rosendo.
We buried the treasure here, but I can't find it!
If we don't give it to Regino today,
he won't let Pancho get out of jail.
My goodness.
Why didn't you mark the spot?
We did, but I can't find it. It was too dark, I couldn't see.
Everything looked different, I'm not sure anymore.
Don't worry, we're here to help.
Don't worry, we're here to help. If we all pitch in, we'll find it in no time.
Everyone, get to the house and bring shovels, pickaxes,
hoes, and wheelbarrows. My daughter-in-law needs help!
-Yes, Dad. -Hurry up!
Let me help you, you take a break.
One, two, three, four, five, wait, no.
Mari, my love!
-What took you so long? -Oh, Fran!
-What took you so long? -Oh, Fran! It was a nightmare finding the treasure. At first we couldn't find it.
It was a nightmare finding the treasure. At first we couldn't find it.
Thank God your family helped, so we finally found it.
At least you're here now and this will be over soon.
-I know, my love. -Let's see.
Mari…
Mari, where's the gold? These are just rocks.
Oh, Fran.
Forgive me, but I've decided what to do with the gold.
What I've always dreamed of.
I'm buying houses, cars, jewelry, yachts, clothes.
Mari, don't do this to me!
Please forgive me, but an opportunity like this
only comes once in a lifetime,
and this is mine.
-Bye! -Wait, Mari.
Mari, please don't. Don't do this to me!
Mari, please don't do this!
No, no!
What kind of dream was that? You were screaming.
It was nothing, officer.
Any news from my wife or my relatives?
No, sir, nothing.
Thanks.
-What's going on? -You didn't hear?
It seems Rosendo's son
buried a huge treasure here in the property.
Whoever finds it first is getting half.
What if someone finds it and keeps quiet?
Well, then… I guess they'd keep it all.
-What are we waiting for? -Let's do it.
Let's see who finds it first.
-Do it right, babe! -What the hell?
-Sorry about that. -I thought you were hurt.
Grab a shovel, then. Come on!
-Did you find anything, dear? -Nothing yet, Don Rosendo.
With all these new holes, we may never find it.
-This place is unrecognizable. -Don't worry.
We know all these folks, they're honest people.
I'll make sure we don't stop until we find that treasure.
Mari, my dear. I brought you food and water.
What if we don't find it,
and Pancho is stuck in jail for five years?
Oh, my God. He must be desperate.
I'm going to find the spot right now.
Right now!
-Any news from my wife? -Nothing yet.
-My dad is getting pretty mad. -What's taking her so long?
Rumor has it, the treasure's lost. They can't find it anywhere.
What if you break me out so I can find it myself?
What if you never come back? In your dreams!
Could you run it by my godfather?
I did, he said if in 24 hours, the treasure doesn't turn up,
I should take you straight to the state penitentiary.
You've been warned.
For fuck's sake! What could've gone wrong?
Here's something!
Let me see, son.
All right, Rosendo. Give it here.
It's Fulgencio's skull.
-Look at this. -How can you tell?
-Look at this. -How can you tell? -It could be anyone! -What about this?
-It could be anyone! -What about this?
I was there when your father shot him in the head.
It still smells like him.
Who was this Fulgencio? Why did my dad shoot him?
I dated him once.
One day, your father caught us cheating,
so he shot him eight times, but this one was the one.
so he shot him eight times, but this one was the one. This was the one that killed him. Right here.
-Where are you going, Mariquita? -This is insane, Don Rosendo.
We didn't dig that deep.
We won't find it soon, maybe not ever.
I should go see Pancho,
tell him what's going on, and come up with a plan.
Don't you worry, dear.
As sure as I'm Rosendo Reyes I'll keep digging until I find it,
As sure as I'm Rosendo Reyes I'll keep digging until I find it, even if it takes me a thousand years.
Let's go, kids.
Come on.
Wake up, fuckers! We're only getting started!
Come on, Rufino, Hilario, Socorro, Jacinta!
You too, Bartola! Let's get to work.
We're exhausted, Dad!
I'm at my wit's end, Pancho.
I can't stay with your family. They're the worst, Pancho.
Just take the kids and go back home.
And leave you here? Don't say that!
If you return to the city, we'll have more options.
We could get a loan, pawn something off, or hire a good lawyer.
One more thing, I need you to tell Don Jaime what's going on.
I need you to tell Don Jaime what's going on.
The last thing I need is to lose my job.
Pancho, I can't just leave you here.
The kids won't be happy to go home without their dad.
All right, kids. What do you want?
Do you want to go home with Lupita and Mom?
Or stay at your grandparents' and wait for Dad to get out.
-I want to go home, Dad. -I hate this stinking town.
-See, honey? -Pancho, step back.
I'm going to let you say your goodbyes.
Make it quick.
Don't forget how much I love you.
-Time's up. -Don't forget.
-I won't. -Bye, kids.
-Bye. -Bye, Dad.
Goodbye, my love.
Goodbye, Don Rosendo. Farewell, Doña Dolores. Give my regards to everyone, and I beg of you,
Give my regards to everyone, and I beg of you, never ever abandon my Pancho.
Don't worry, dear.
-Let's go, Lupita. -I'm sorry, ma'am. I have some news.
-Let's go, Lupita. -I'm sorry, ma'am. I have some news. Guess what? I'm staying here.
Guess what? I'm staying here.
Rosendito proposed and I said yes!
-Have you thought this through? -Of course I have.
So… does that mean we'll be related?
-Oh, yes. -Well, congratulations. Thank you, sis. We'll send you an invite soon.
Thank you, sis. We'll send you an invite soon. As soon as we set a date. Safe travels!
As soon as we set a date. Safe travels!
Bye, Cati.
Bye, Toni. Come visit, okay? -Be good to your mom. -Let's go, kids.
-Be good to your mom. -Let's go, kids.
-Bye. -Hey, Mom?
-Is Lupita our aunt now? -Is she, Mom?
Don't even joke about that. You're dead if you tell anyone.
Godson, I'm truly sorry you're in this situation.
I already talked to the judge. He said no money, no dice.
I've been locked up for over ten days!
My family hasn't stopped looking for the treasure.
Just let me out of here. I swear I know where it is.
I wish I could!
These are no longer the good old days.
If the judge finds out my relative got special treatment,
we'd both be fucked.
I'm begging you, Godfather.
Just name your price.
Anything at all! Just get me out of here.
Are you sure, Pancho?
Anything, Godfather.
I'd sell my soul to the devil to get out of this place.
Officer, send in the notary.
Tell him to bring the contracts.
Look, everyone!
Uncle Pancho's here! They cut him loose!
Grandpa, Grandma! They released Uncle Pancho!
Pancho Francisco Reyes! It's good to see you free.
Pancho Francisco Reyes! It's good to see you free. -I'm so glad to see you! -Oh, Pancho.
-I'm so glad to see you! -Oh, Pancho. You're nothing but skin and bones! Can I make you something?
You're nothing but skin and bones! Can I make you something? No thanks, Mom.
Why aren't you back in the city?
Well, sir, I've moved in with Rosendito.
We're engaged, and we're expecting.
God makes them and the devil pairs them.
What happened, Panchito?
Did you drop the soap back in prison?
Or, did you manage to save the family's honor?
Come on, fucker.
Kids, get dressed!
Get shovels and pickaxes. Let's help Pancho!
…23, 24, 25, 26 and 27.
See? My dear Mari was right! This is the right spot.
Grab your shovels, and let's help him--
You know what, Dad? I'd rather do it alone.
If you start digging wherever you please, I won't find anything in this mess.
Mind if we stick around to keep you company?
You know, for moral support.
Afternoon, Grandma.
-Did Pancho find the treasure? -Nothing yet.
I think that the gold is lost forever,
and that sucker is just completely deluded.
Don't say that, Grandma. His heart is set on it.
God willing, he'll find it one of these days.
What Pancho ought to do is give up on the whole thing,
go back where he came from, and leave us alone.
-We were better off without him. -You're so mean.
-Don't you fear God? -You're the ones who should fear Him!
Instead of working your way up like decent people,
you're sucking up to him, to see if he throws you a bone.
Come on, girls. Beans don't cook themselves.
"Look at me. Beans don't cook themselves."
Son, it's getting late.
Get some sleep, you'll take it up tomorrow.
No, I'm not leaving until I find that treasure.
I have a feeling I'm getting close.
-I'm very, very close. -All right, son.
See you tomorrow, and good luck.
Son, please stop!
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women,
The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
Grant him eternal rest,
and let perpetual light shine upon him.
May our Pancho's soul and those in Purgatory
May our Pancho's soul and those in Purgatory forever rest in peace. Amen.
Amen. Ambrosio, isn't it a bit much to take him for dead?
Ambrosio, isn't it a bit much to take him for dead?
He's still alive. I'm not taking him for dead, God forbid!
I'm not taking him for dead, God forbid! Pancho, just like St. Anthony, has got the devil in him.
It's up to us to do what we can to save his soul.
The doctor said there's still hope.
Oh, Dolores. Twenty days and nights without food or sleep,
Twenty days and nights without food or sleep,
digging that hellish hole.
Lying there another ten days like Saint Simon.
Do you really think he's going to wake up?
What about a miracle? Don't you believe in those?
Rosendo, don't be naive.
God grants miracles to good people, and in this family,
maybe just one of the kids will be spared from Hell.
You shut your mouth, bird of ill omen.
Oh, my God. So much tragedy.
Why did this happen to us?
God, please, grant us a miracle.
I'm leaving.
I'm getting out of here and going back to my family.
It's a miracle!
-Goodbye, brother. -God bless.
Thanks for everything. You're a good man.
See you, brother. Give our love to your family.
See you at the wedding. Right, Lupita?
Mr. Pancho, sorry I let you and Mrs. Mari down.
I called my sister in San Pedro to fill in for me.
No need, sis. Mari and I will figure it out.
Pancho, God help you and keep you safe.
Tell Mari about the miracle so that she knows He exists.
The dark swallows shall one day return!
Bye, Pancho.
If you're ever in town and you're feeling sad, I'll be around.
My brother. My soul brother.
I wish you luck. I hope you rebuild your life.
Pancho, thank you for getting rid of Lupe.
This is all I could recover from your things.
I love you very much, and I'll fucking miss you.
Give my love to my niece and nephew.
I'm finally leaving, Grandma.
I guess you're happy to get rid of my snotty self.
I may have won the battle, but I lost the war.
Just for today, let's make a truce.
Just for today, let's make a truce. Give me a kiss, as I'm sure we won't see each other again.
Give me a kiss, as I'm sure we won't see each other again.
Bye, Grandma.
God bless you, son. Don't hold a grudge against us,
and come back soon.
Don't worry, Mom. It's all forgiven.
Goodbye, Dad.
I sincerely wish you all the best.
I hope you'll forgive me one day and hold no grudge.
What's there to forgive?
We're blessed to have a son as good as you.
I promise you that, even if it costs me my life,
I won't give up until I find your treasure.
Even if it takes me forever and a day.
Forever and a day!
Goodbye, Dad.
Goodbye, kids!
-Bye, kids. -Goodbye.
Goodbye, son.
Pancho…
Fucking Grandpa.
I'll always wonder if you did this on purpose,
or if you ruined our lives out of sheer bad luck.
But knowing you as well as I did,
I'm sure than none of this was a coincidence.
Wherever you are,
I'm sure you must be laughing your ass off
as you watch our lives crumble around us.
In honor of your memory,
and better than the mausoleum you wanted so badly,
I'm going to do something that will make you proud.
Something you will never, ever forget, Grandpa.
What's this, Pancho?
You're leaving without saying goodbye?
It's time I leave, Godfather, hopefully for good.
Did you find anything?
No.
What a shame, but I'm glad you gave up such madness
and recovered your reason and your sanity.
Here's a copy of the contract, certified by the notary.
-Check it before you leave. -No need, Godfather.
All I ask is that you're not too tough on my family.
Who do you take me for? Pascuala is my mother.
Your father shares my blood, and I adore your siblings.
-See you, Commander. -Bye, Pancho!
This is goodbye, Godfather. Look after my family.
I told you, get that out of your mind.
The administration's priority is the well-being of the poor.
Luckily, your family falls on the right side of history.
They are part of the noble, wise masses.
Godspeed, son.
-Godfather. -Yes?
Don't take this the wrong way,
but this government reminds me of all the previous ones.
You're wrong, listen…
Spoiled, renegade brat.
The nation will square him up and put him in his place.
Reginito. Let's pay a visit to the family and tell them to leave immediately.
Let's pay a visit to the family and tell them to leave immediately.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Dad! Lunch is ready.
Hey, Dad! Lunch is ready. Shall we wait for you or go ahead without you?
Let's go, son.
-No luck? -None, my girl.
If we keep digging, we'll reach China one day.
Let's go!
Careful.
Lazy, good-for-nothing sons of bitches.
Hell!
Morning, Mom.
-Is this all that's left? -Good thing they ate,
-Is this all that's left? -Good thing they ate, because we have nothing for tomorrow.
Don Rosendo, I can get some cactus for you.
Okay.
Fuck you a thousand times, Francisco Reyes!
This is all your fault.
You better be rotting in Hell.
And I hope your shitty grandson joins you soon enough.
What's the point of crying?
Don Rosendo, come quick! We're screwed!
Come on, this is serious!
The police are here!
That must be Regino, trying to evict us.
Mom, give me that. Son of a bitch!
Uncle Rosendo, surrender, please, without resistance.
Come on, kids. Let's face this fucker!
Please, surrender without resistance
I have a judge's order to evict the property immediately!
Fuck that, Godson.
You'll have to kill us all before your jerk of a father
You'll have to kill us all before your jerk of a father takes our house!
Evacuate the property!
Don't make me take action.
I repeat, Godfather!
Surrender yourselves or I'm going to be compelled to use the public force.
Don't be stupid, Rosendo!
Don't endanger your family.
Evacuate the house or I'll send in the cops
Evacuate the house or I'll send in the cops and knock down the house on top of you!
Fuck you.
Fire!
Motherfuckers!
Let go of me!
Get the hell out of my house!
Motherfuckers!
Screw you, Regino!
I swear on Dad's memory you'll pay for this.
You and that traitor Pancho will answer for this!
Come on, son.
All this is finally ours.
Let's get to work.
Mr. Reyes. Good news.
Come with us. I think we found it.
I knew Pancho's treasure would turn up sooner or later!
Your nephew came so close to finding it.
He was wrong by less than two feet.
-Some people are born unlucky. -Agreed!
I have even better news.
I doubt it's better than this.
Look what your nephew was about to find.
A gold-bearing vein in the old Esperanza mine.
Rosendo was right all along.
It's one of the largest veins ever discovered.
Praise God!
Rosendo and Pancho, you did it!
God bless you both! God bless you!
Sorry, but I also have some bad news.
What?
You are forgetting the contract you signed with us.
All this is ours.
No!
I didn't sign anything! Not a thing!
This gold is mine.
I'm sorry, sir. But the law is the law.
You signed the contract.
I'm getting an injunction!
The gold is mine! I'll get an injunction!
It's mine, all mine!
How much longer will they keep us here?
-It's been over two months. -Who knows, Lola?
I guess Regino and Reginito forgot all about us.
-We might stay here forever. -Stop whining.
At least we're getting three meals a day!
Listen, family.
-Get your things, you're free. -Praise the Lord.
Why did your shitty father keep us here for so long?
Please don't disrespect me and don't mention my father.
He's at the hospital, it's very serious.
I'm the temporary mayor, I'm in charge now.
Better hurry up,
before I change my mind and add two more months.
And you, Ambrosio? Where's your cassock?
I heard God's voice again, like when I was a kid.
He told me the Roman Church is morally bankrupt,
but the Bible has always contained the answer.
Jesus Christ is our savior.
The end of days are coming, so take this opportunity
granted by our brand-new mayor,
and go out into the light before he takes it back.
and go out into the light before he takes it back. Out, sinners!
Out, sinners!
Once again!
This family is worse than the plague!
NO TRESPASSING US-CANADA MINING CO.
Look, Dad. You were right.
Grandpa's mine held a mountain of gold!
What's next, honey?
Poor Mexico.
So far from God, and so close to the U.S.
Fuck you, Pancho Reyes!
We have no house, no dreams, no hope.
Meanwhile, that bastard is living like a king!
Francisco Reyes,
your presence is requested in the director's office.
Francisco Reyes,
your presence is requested in the director's office.
Come in!
Come in, Pancho. Come on in.
Hello, Don Jaime.
Hello, Normita.
What is it, Pancho? Normita was telling me you've been trying to meet with me. So?
First, I'm very grateful you agreed to see me.
I'm also grateful for the chance to keep working here.
No need. Normita thanked me already.
No need. Normita thanked me already. She finally let me unbury her treasure,
and convinced me not to fire you.
Thank you, Normita.
-Is that all? -I also wanted to ask,
If there's any chance I can get my old job back.
Don't give me that bullshit.
Be grateful I didn't fire you like you deserved.
After walking away from your job,
you deserved to have my shoeprint on your ass.
Luckily, I sold the company to the fucking gringos.
They'll decide what to do with you.
Could you recommend me to the new management?
Maybe ask your mother!
Or that commie President, who loves poor people like you.
Good thing I'm emigrating before he ruins the country,
and turns it into Cuba or Venezuela.
If that's all, fuck off!
Neither the gringos nor I pay you to stand around.
Thank you for the opportunity.
Thank you, Normita.
You're welcome, engineer.
My goodness!
Don't blame the pig, blame those who feed it.
What's happened sir? See where you ended up?
What comes up, eventually comes down.
What comes up, eventually comes down. -So, what? -What?
Well, so what?
-Fuck you! -Motherfucker!
GIVE IT UP FOR THE POOR! AMLO FOR PRESIDENT, AGAIN!
-Family, I'm home! -I'm so glad.
The ceiling caved in, and we have leaks.
-How did it go? -Not great.
I met with Don Jaime, but he rejected my promotion.
I met with Don Jaime, but he rejected my promotion. -Damn it. -Oh, well. That's life.
-Damn it. -Oh, well. That's life.
-I have a surprise, right? -Yeah.
Surprise!
What's up, Pancho? What took you so long?
I hope you don't mind us getting comfortable.
We're moving in with you!
Thank God you made it home safe!
-Cheers, Pancho! -Drink some tequila.
-Cheers, Pancho! -Drink some tequila. Let's give your family a proper welcome.
See, Panchito?
I told you you'd never get rid of us, fucker!
Come on, Pancho! Don't be snotty! Celebrate with your family, because for us,
Celebrate with your family, because for us, your failure is our happiness.
Cheers to that and long live Mexico, fuckers!
Hurray!
Pancho. Pancho!
Pancho, wake up! You were having a nightmare.
I had the most terrible, dreadful dream.
I keep telling you to see a doctor,
I keep telling you to see a doctor, this isn't normal.
Let me sleep, for fuck's sake. I have one hell of a hangover.
Oh, man.
Pancho, please! Don't be inconsiderate!
Every love story…
begins with the first meeting.
But my love story…
begins with my arranged marriage.
AMBARAWA, CENTRAL JAVA, EARLY 1998
You must be wondering why,
in this modern times,
there are still families who arrange their daughter's marriage.
It's all because of my father.
He married a woman who has now become my stepmother.
Mrs. Indah.
-Come, they're waiting at the garden. -Right.
Let me take you there.
Come on, honey. Let's go, Yura.
Yura…
Yes.
Please sit down, Mrs. Indah.
If you will excuse me, I'll go and call Mrs. Sadewo.
Thank you.
She is my father's wife.
He married her a year after my mother passed away.
GERRY HAR YOUTH'S FAVORITE SINGER
Why haven't I seen this edition before, Dad?
Do you think they would let me have it?
Why do you need it?
Every magazine and newspaper clipping about your father is kept in storage.
And this is my father, an ex-musician who is not famous anymore.
Excuse me. There are two gentlemen outside with flowers.
Did any of you order them?
-I don't think so. -I ordered them, sir.
This way.
Here's your flower, miss.
Thank you.
And I've picked the ones according to your favorite color.
Miss.
Here is the invoice.
Security, tell her to come in!
Ms. Yura, you've been asked to come in.
These two are my best friends.
They are the substitutes for all that I have lost.
Is there anything else? Please go.
-No, we don't. -We don't.
Please forgive me.
-Did you wait long? -Mrs. Sadewo.
This is Nisa.
-Who is this? -She is my biological daughter.
Mrs. Sadewo.
Gerry.
I am one of your biggest fans.
Yura. Come here, honey.
This is Yura.
She is my biological daughter.
She's beautiful.
Please have a seat.
Go on.
Be my guest.
Boby's two younger brothers are married.
Even Kevin, the youngest one,
is going to get engaged.
I don't want to see Boby getting stepped over again.
This will never happen if my husband doesn't support me, Mrs. Sadewo.
I really appreciate it, Gerry.
Hi, honey.
-How are you, sir? -I'm fine.
Boby Sadewo.
Yura.
-Yura Diandra-- -Diandra Hartono?
And I'm sure Diandra is your mother's name.
I'm just guessing.
Sir, we are going to do a music recording soon.
We're going to do it together?
Mom, haven't you told him?
All right, please have a seat. We'll talk about it now.
-Hi, Mrs. Indah. -Boby.
Hi.
How is your new house, Bob?
I didn't choose the wrong architect, did I?
In fact, I really like the design of the recording studio…
You have your own recording studio?
Our recording studio, to be precise, Mr. Gerry.
Are we going to record there?
While the instruments are still brand-new. Why not?
Why don't you take Gerry and Yura to see that place?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sadewo, but I can't do it today.
-I am scheduled to perform today. -You can cancel it, can't you?
This is more important.
Or maybe Yura can go in your place?
That's a good idea.
She used to go with his father during recording sessions.
I don't mind.
If you both give us permission, I'll be glad to take her there.
We wouldn't mind at all. Right, Gerry?
How about it, Yura?
Do you want to come?
Like every love story,
it's always beautiful in the beginning.
At a time like… A FREE ADAPTATION OF THE LEGENDARY TELEVISION SERIES
A FREE ADAPTATION OF THE LEGENDARY TELEVISION SERIES
I'm looking at her and feeling sad
I saw that there's something there
Are you really
going to make an album for my father?
Why are you asking me that?
Who listens to old music nowadays?
I still listen to old music.
I still listen to The Beatles, Queen, Koes Plus, the Indonesian band,
and I also listen to Aerosmith.
They're all legends, right?
Who knows? Maybe I am the one who can turn your father into a legend.
At a time like yesterday
I was silent without saying a word
-Yes, right. -Hey.
-What shall we do? -What do you mean?
The music is lame and old.
-You want to leave? -Let's just get out of here.
-Come on. -Let's go.
Do you need a towel?
I'll get it myself in the bathroom.
Hiding with grief
In the empty stars and the dark cloudy night sky
I'm waiting for her
To take me back again
Thank you.
That was the last song for all of you who came here tonight.
Have a great night.
Thank you, sir.
Yura hasn't come home yet?
I think she stayed overnight.
Where did she stay?
At Boby's house, of course.
Here's your coffee.
Why aren't you concerned that Yura spent the night at Boby's house?
Why do I need to be concerned?
She will soon be his wife anyway.
In fact, the sooner the better.
The sooner the wedding is held,
the sooner you can release your new album.
Isn't that right?
Come on, eat your breakfast.
Who could that be this early in the morning?
Go and take a look.
Is it your friend?
Good morning, Mrs. Sadewo.
-Mrs. Sadewo. -We didn't expect you to come so early.
-Please come in. -That's not necessary.
I just want to give this back.
-That's for me. Have some manners. -Wait, I just want to see it.
LETTER OF DEBT AGREEMENT
A letter of debt agreement?
Give it to me!
Careful! Don't tear out the letter! It's very important!
Mrs. Sadewo, haven't we talked about this yesterday?
The wedding is cancelled,
including the recording of Gerry's album.
You owe her five billion rupiah?
Why did we come to her house? Please shut your mouth!
So you don't even know the affairs of your own wife?
Mrs. Sadewo, let's just talk this through, okay?
Seize the house.
-Go! -Take the deed and all their belongings.
-Wait! -Please, Mrs. Sadewo!
Please. I will take responsibility, but please tell me what happened?
Hey!
Your daughter has robbed Boby.
And she left a scar on his face.
-Mrs. Sadewo! -Hey!
Mrs. Sadewo!
-Yura is my daughter, not hers! -Please, I will talk to Yura.
-I will talk to her! -Yura is my daughter!
-She is my responsibility! -Gerry!
She'll never do such a thing!
I will talk to her, Mrs. Sadewo!
That's enough!
I will give you a week.
If Yura doesn't come, and you haven't paid your debt,
you must all leave this house!
Mrs. Sadewo.
Mrs. Sadewo.
Let's go!
Everything is ruined!
This never would've happened if your daughter wasn't such a fool!
Watch your mouth!
It's you who owes her five billion!
If I don't borrow, how can we pay the bills?
How can we pay for Yura's and Nisa's education?
Gerry!
Just so you know, your songs aren't worth anything anymore!
And now, your daughter has ruined everything!
Including your own dream!
-Nisa, where do you think you're going? -I'm going with Dad!
Nisa!
Where are you going to look for Yura, Dad?
As far as I know, Yura only has two friends.
Yura is going to stay here for now until she settles her problem.
Are you Oka, Yura's friend?
-Yes. What's the matter, sir? -Where is she?
I'll tell you where she is.
Yura is my daughter!
-What right do you have on my daughter? -You want me to strangle your child too?
-What is this? -What's going on here?
-Who are you? -I'm the owner of this boarding house.
-Who is she? -She's my wife!
Why are you hitting my son?
I'm looking for my daughter, Yura.
Calm down, Dad.
Where is Yura?
-Where's Yura? -Listen. Come here, Dad.
-Mr. Gerry is my friend's father. -All right, go on.
-Okay. -Her name is Yura.
-She left her house last night. -You took a girl out of her house?
-You took her out of her house? -Who is that?
-What's the matter? -You raped her?
-No! -What's going on?
-Then what? -Just wait a second, Dad!
Hey, Oka! Where's Yura?
-You have to promise first-- -Promise what?
-Where is she? -Hey, hold on a second.
You have to promise me not to take her back to your house.
Yes, my dad agrees. Please tell us where she is right now.
Sir.
There she is.
It's been a while
since you visited her, right?
What happened to you?
Talk to me.
What have you heard about me?
I don't want to hear it from other people.
I want to hear it from you.
Bob?
Hey. No.
What's wrong?
You don't trust me?
What difference does it make?
In the end, we are still going to get married.
I think I should go home now.
I need to go home now.
Bob!
Your family owes my family a lot of money!
You are just collateral!
-Let me go! -Shut up!
A week before we went to Mrs. Sadewo's house,
I had told Tian and Oka about it.
I told them that I was being arranged for marriage.
They insisted on looking out for me.
But I told them not to do that.
I'm sorry, Dad.
But I will never go back to your house.
All of this shouldn't have happened
if I wasn't like this.
I feel so helpless!
I already hit rock bottom.
All of this is just the beginning.
The start of my journey that begins with the wound.
SPECIAL CUISINE TUMPANG KOYOR DELICIOUSLY SPICY!
It's just that I didn't think
I would lose everything.
I've lost my mom before,
now I've lost my father.
All of my family.
-Oka! -Yes, Dad?
Take the koyor out of the fridge.
Hold on, Dad.
I'm trying a new recipe.
Recipe?
You're just making instant noodles.
What?
Why are you making instant noodles?
You little monkey!
Now, just take out the koyor from the fridge, okay?
I'll teach you how to cook.
-Hey, hold on a second! -What?
Let me tell you something. Your mother is a foreigner.
She can't cook tumpang koyor.
I will teach you how to cook it.
How to cook tumpang koyor! Cook! Do you understand?
I'm not your only son. Go and ask the others to do it.
Why do I have to do everything?
I want you to do it! What's the matter with you?
That's not fair, Dad! Why do I always have to do it?
Who's asking you to go to a fair, like Jakarta Fair?
Mom, Dad called me a monkey!
Well, that's true, honey.
I told you so.
Here you go! Fried bananas, your favorite.
Come on, have some.
Yura, this is your favorite. Why aren't you eating it?
Later, Ian. I'm making my life's short and long-term goals.
Really?
I don't want to keep on being a burden to Oka.
I need to finish my college degree.
I'm going to take a lot of classes so I can graduate and work.
Oka and his family are happy that you're here.
-I don't feel good about that. -Why don't you feel good about it?
-I've stayed here too long-- -Tian! Yura!
Here it is, my new recipe!
What are you guys doing there? Come here and try this.
Come here and try this.
-What is that? -Just try it.
This is for Yura, and this one is for Tian.
-Okay. -What is it? Instant noodles?
Just try it.
Looks good.
-What do you think? -I haven't tasted it yet!
Is it good?
-It's good, right? -Yes, the sauce is very spicy.
So do you think I'm worthy of being called a chef? Chef Oka Saputra.
Lunch is ready!
Please bring those plates over there. And also the rice.
Come on, everybody! Eat!
-Oka, Cristian, Yura! Hurry! -Tumpang koyor.
-Tumpang koyor. -Let's go.
So am I worthy or not?
-Hurry up! -Gather up!
Where is it, Mrs. Somad?
Come here.
-I want some too. -This is for you.
-Yura! Ian! -I want some koyor.
What do you think? You haven't answered my question.
Yes, you are worthy to be called a chef.
Only if you can make instant noodles with a tumpang koyor flavor like this.
That's right!
How can I make instant noodles with a tumpang koyor flavor?
Here you go.
I want some more.
-Have some more, okay? -Okay, Mrs. Somad.
Mr. Burhan, my scholarship is still in effect, right?
As long as your GPA is 3.5 or above, it will be in effect until you graduate.
If you can graduate quickly, that would benefit the university.
How about it?
Are you going to add extra classes for this semester?
-Is there anything else? -That would be all, Mr. Burhan.
-Thank you. -Okay. You're welcome.
My fellow comrades who are well known and who are unnoticed by the public,
who are courageous and without ulterior motives,
who are selfless and who's given all they have for others.
My fellow comrades, let us overthrow this depravity of a regime!
The apprehension of activists, the imprisonment and abductions…
NEPOTISM, POWER, AND CRONYISM IN THE NEW ORDER GOVERNMENT
What is this?
There is no other option, fight them or die!
Why are you reading this stuff?
Ian, when are you going to propose to Yura?
What's the matter with you? Why are you talking nonsense?
How long are you going to keep it to yourself?
Let me tell you something.
Listen.
If you had proposed to her in the beginning,
maybe she wouldn't have ended up like this.
So easy to accept an arranged marriage by her parents.
What's that got to do with it?
They had to put her in an arranged marriage because of their debt.
It wouldn't matter if I proposed to her or not.
You're ridiculous.
Ian, of course it would matter.
If you were already together, things wouldn't be like this.
-Ian, listen to me. -What is it?
Yura needs someone who will support her in making her own choices.
-So? -If you're with her,
she'll follow you wherever you go.
It's obvious! That incident wouldn't have happened.
She almost got raped, you know?
Come on, Ian. Before anything else happens to her, just propose to her.
Who's proposing? Who's the lucky girl?
Are you guys talking about me?
Ian wants to propose to you.
You want to propose to me?
That's right, Yura.
I've always wanted to propose to you.
Because you are the right person…
You are the right person
to become the Finance Manager for our business.
What business, Oka?
That's right, Oka. Please explain it to Yura.
This is all his idea.
I need to go to the bathroom.
-What are you doing? -I need to go to the bathroom!
Yura, please come here. Just sit down.
Have a seat.
-Where were we? Right, business! -What kind of business?
We are going to make a profitable business that has a future.
What kind of business? What are you guys going to make?
You know, a business of… What is it called, Ian?
-That hurts! -Business…
It's a business about…
-Instant noodles. -That's right.
-Instant noodles? -What? Yes, that's right.
You want to supply instant noodles?
-No, not a supplier. -Not that.
We are planning to put up a store that sells instant noodles.
-Like those kiosks near the sidewalks? -No, it's different.
-It's different. -Explain it.
We're going to make it a cool place where young people can hang out.
-Excuse me, I want to ask something. -Yes?
-Do you know Yura Diandra? -Yura?
-She majors in Economics. -Yura usually hangs out there.
-Really? Thank you. -You're welcome.
Hold on a minute.
Why are you guys starting a business like this all of a sudden?
What's going on?
And why are you asking me to join?
Here's the thing, Yura.
Actually, this is all Ian's idea.
Isn't that right, Ian?
Ian is planning all of this to help you.
Hopefully, this can help pay off your parents' debt.
-Yura! -Is it true, Ian?
Nisa?
Why aren't you at school?
What is it?
Didn't you see how panicked I looked?
But she looks more cheerful. That's a good thing, right?
Oka, Ian.
-I'll be right back, okay? -Sure.
Hey, why didn't you propose to her?
Are you crazy?
Next time you want to pull something like that, you better tell me first!
But it turned out fine, right? Didn't you see her face?
I also looked terrified! You imbecile!
The house, the car, and our furniture have all been sold.
Well, they were only worth two and a half billion rupiah.
Why was their worth so low?
What else can we do, Yura?
Mrs. Sadewo's goons kept on terrorizing us.
And then?
How are we going to pay off the rest of the debt?
Last night,
after Dad came back from Mrs. Sadewo's house,
he suddenly collapsed.
The doctor said he had a stroke.
That's Dad's room.
What are you doing here? Haven't you had enough?
Mom.
Calm down, Mom.
That's enough.
Do we have money to pay the hospital?
We can't even pay half of our rent.
But I will find a job, Yura.
What about your studies?
No.
You don't need to find a job.
-You must go to school. -How do we pay for it?
That's none of your concern, Nisa.
You just need to go to school until you graduate, okay?
And if you need anything, you can find me at Oka's house.
I need to go now.
Yura.
This situation isn't fair to you.
Nisa.
I'm not looking for fairness.
I only seek acceptance.
You stay here and accompany Dad, okay?
Here it is.
Hey, go ahead. Try this.
Because of that act you did yesterday, I couldn't sleep last night.
-Try it. -Which one is spicy?
The one on the left.
I know what's good for a woman like you!
I don't have anybody else, Auntie!
Are you talking back to me? What is this?
Stop watching soap operas. You need to eat first.
Hey, if you want to get married, Hendra is waiting for you!
-You need to eat first! -I can eat and watch at the same time.
This is good.
What did you use for seasoning?
That's a secret.
Here she comes.
-Yura, come here. -Yura!
Come on. Here, try this out.
You need to try this.
This one is not spicy. Instant noodles made by Oka.
-Try it, Yura. -This time it's delicious.
Oka, it's so delicious! For someone who doesn't like spicy food, this is good.
-It's good, right? -We can start our business now.
Hey, hold on a second.
We're starting an instant noodle business,
but that doesn't mean we'll put it up instantly.
Everything needs to be calculated. We need to relax and slow down
so everything will go smoothly. Right, Oka?
We need to check the materials and a lot of other things.
-We need to plan everything. -Let's do it now.
-Wait a minute. -What do we need?
Stop it. Put this down for now.
Why are you in such a hurry? Just relax, okay?
If we don't hurry, others will beat us to it.
-Just relax. -We need to be first.
You need to relax. Just trust me on this.
For the next five, ten years, Indonesians will still love instant noodles.
-Especially with my recipe. -Oka's recipe is delicious!
-Just relax for now. -It's good, right?
Well, you guys are lucky.
You still have parents who give you a monthly allowance.
What about me?
It's not like that, Yura. What I mean is…
If we do this slowly, everything will be much better.
All right, you guys go ahead and count slowly.
I'm going to look for a job.
Yura!
Aren't you going to give this another thought?
WITHDRAWAL LETTER
This is very unfortunate. Your GPA is above average.
I can't be selfish, Mr. Burhan.
I need to find a job.
Thank you.
What is going on anyway? I've never used a dollar before.
I've been using rupiah ever since I was a child.
People from Jakarta are very finicky. I don't care about that kind of stuff.
I just want to sell newspapers so my family can eat.
Everything's okay. That's it.
JOB VACANCIES
Honey!
It's lunchtime!
I made some very special tumpang koyor that isn't spicy at all just for you.
-Thank you, Mrs. Somad. -You have to eat it all.
-I made a lot, you know? -Okay.
THE SADEWO FAMILY SUSPECTED OF PLATINUM SCAM
-Just tell me what the issue is. -It's okay.
Yura Diandra, please come in.
This way, miss.
This way, please.
Here's the thing.
We need to cancel the interview, okay?
Why is that?
Well, the situation in this office is a little chaotic right now.
However, I will contact you again, okay?
You can go now.
The fall of the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar
will cause thousands of people to become unemployed.
The number of unemployed will increase by more than five million.
Several countries have also experienced monetary crises. Countries like…
You have to eat, Dad.
Open your mouth.
Nisa, please help me.
When are your exams?
In three months.
-Which high school do you want to go to? -How are we going to pay for it?
We can't even pay the hospital bills.
And we still need to pay off our debt to the Sadewos.
You guys are dreaming.
Mom.
THE SADEWO FAMILY SUSPECTED OF PLATINUM SCAM
Excuse me, Nurse. Where is the patient in this room?
He was sent home this afternoon.
-Are you Yura? -Yes.
Your sister, Nisa, left you a message.
Here you go.
Dad was allowed to go home, Yura.
I called Oka's house, but they told me you weren't home yet.
If you can, please come by our house, okay?
-Excuse me, ma'am. -Yes?
Does Mr. Gerry live here?
-Yes, he does. -Yes.
Here?
-Yes. -Right.
Yura!
-Excuse me. -Sure.
Come, Daddy's inside.
Hi, Yura.
You guys?
Why are you here?
Dad was able to go home because of Tian.
The menu for our business is all set.
Everything is ready. The menu, the employees.
We just need to start.
Yura?
-Yura! -Make way.
Yura?
Yura!
Yura, listen to me. What's the matter with you?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong to you?
Didn't you tell us not to take things slow?
Why are you acting like this?
I'm the selfish person here.
I am selfish, finicky, disrespectful, and very arrogant…
I am…
Listen to me. Everything has been taken care of.
What do you mean?
The hospital bills…
and your father's house rent has all been taken care of.
My father's house rent?
I've paid in advance for two years.
How do you know all of my family's problems?
I know it from Nisa. She told me everything.
Don't blame Nisa. Do you hear me?
Don't blame her. This has nothing to do with her.
She didn't do anything wrong.
In fact, because of her,
Oka and I became motivated to start our business immediately.
Isn't that what you wanted? That's what we all want, right?
So we can start our business and develop it.
How did you get that much money, Ian?
-Where did you get it? -That's not important.
It's not important where I got it from.
It's important to me.
Where did you get it?
You don't trust me?
Believe me, I will never do something foolish.
I will never steal other people's money.
Okay.
Why are you doing all this?
What is your intention?
Oka is right.
He always told me…
"Tell her the truth, Ian. Talk to her face to face."
But I always avoided it. I never listened to him.
Because I wasn't ready, Yura.
I wasn't ready to be honest with you.
I…
I am doing this…
because…
Because I love you.
I love you, Yura.
I want to…
help you realize your dreams.
You're kidding, right?
You think I'm joking?
Why do you think I'm doing all this?
That it's all a lie? I'm lying to you?
You know that I'm not ready to have a new relationship.
You know what happened that night, don't you?
-I'm still not ready to trust-- -Yura.
I promise you…
I will never hurt your feelings.
I will try, Ian.
And I will wait for you.
But remember
all the money that you gave my family,
I consider it as debt.
Whatever.
It's up to you.
I only ask one thing from you.
I want you to trust me.
To be honest, I'm already fed up with love.
Especially if it begins with pity.
Thank you.
Maybe I'm naive.
But I'm not selfish.
I'm grateful when people are good to me.
Especially to that person who saved my life.
The sweet story
Just woke up from a dream…
-Instant noodles special with satay. -Okay.
How can I help you? What's your order?
Yoi Mie? Come with me.
I want toppings--
One more with chicken satay.
In mother's embrace
Like a rose
So pretty and beautiful
How does it taste? Is it good?
-Yes. -Thank you.
What do you guys think? Did you like the noodles?
It's very delicious. My friends really like it.
This is an ordinary instant noodle, right? How can it taste this good?
That's what makes it special. This is all in the secret recipe of…
Chef Oka!
Oka Saputra!
The beautiful story
It will be the reason For this face to keep smiling…
-Two million, four hundred and… -In just one day?
-Sixty-seven thousand? -Sixty-seven?
Oka! Hey!
-Hey, stop playing! -What is it?
-This is how much we got. -How much?
Two million, four hundred and…
Sixty-seven thousand rupiah!
-Are you serious? -Yes!
This is from Yura to pay for your school.
Please give my gratitude to my sister.
Sorry that we have to meet here. I don't want Mom to know about it.
-Thank you. Goodbye. -You're welcome.
One or two?
-We'll order two, please. -All right.
Here you go!
This one is with a satay topping and this is the chicken special.
Like a rose
So pretty and beautiful…
-Excuse me, sir. -Yes?
-Can I talk to the owner of Yoi Mie? -That's us.
I am from Kawula Muda.
Kawula Muda Magazine?
-The magazine? -That's right.
-Really? -How can we help you?
Dad, take a look at this.
My business with Oka and Cristian was featured in a magazine.
Look, isn't this cool? That's me!
-My grades are good. -Do you see it, Dad?
REPORT CARD
-Go and tell your father. -Sure.
Dad.
-Hi! -Yura?
Yura, take a look at this.
My grades are good.
Dad, look at this!
-You're such a smart kid! -Thank you!
You should've cut your hair. This ruined the picture.
Look, this is your right side and this is your left.
-What is this? -Hey, I haven't finished reading it!
-There's something more important. -What is it?
Happy wedding anniversary, Mom and Dad!
Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Somad!
-Dad, open it. -All right.
I'm opening it.
What is this, son?
-Is it a walkie-talkie? -It's a cell phone, Dad.
-Cell phone? Where's the cable? -Like this, Dad--
Modern telephones are like this.
Can I call the house with this?
You can call Mom too.
-Really? -Because Mom also has one.
You both can call each other with this cell phone.
Thank you, Ian.
For what?
For everything.
At first, I was hesitant to go through all this.
You really are a nice guy, aren't you?
Yura.
What is it?
May I ask you something?
What is it?
How do I say this? I've always wanted
to tell you this.
Ian, you've already told me
that you couldn't tell me anything at all before, right?
That's right.
But this time is different.
Yura Diandra Hartono.
Will you marry me?
Ian.
I am not saying no.
But I'm not saying yes either.
Don't misunderstand. It's not that I don't love you.
But I still don't know who you are, Ian.
And your family…
I haven't even met them.
You know that
I've always wanted to have a normal family,
not just a relationship with you,
but also a relationship between my family and yours.
Who are you looking for?
Young master!
Come.
Is this your house?
Are you like Batman?
I'll never forget your name, Master Cristian.
You don't need to call me "Master."
Please come in. Your mother is waiting. Come.
Come on, honey.
I'll just wait here.
You said you wanted to meet my parents.
This way.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming home?
We could've picked you up.
Come on. I'm not like Robert, Mom.
-I don't like being treated like-- -Yes, I know that.
You don't want to be compared to him. I know that.
Are you good and healthy?
-Who did you come here with? -I came here with Yura.
Yura Diandra Hartono.
Yura Diandra Hartono?
Aren't you the daughter of…
What's his name? That famous singer, right?
-Grace. -Yes, ma'am?
Please take Cristian's friend here to her room. Okay?
-All right, ma'am. -Good.
Come, Ms. Yura.
We will have dinner together tonight.
I'm going to cook your favorite dish.
It's been a while, Mom.
Yura?
Honey, you're so beautiful.
Let's eat.
Grace.
Come and join us.
You have to try that fried rice. It's very delicious.
You need to try it.
Is Robert going to join us as well?
According to our customs here,
you are not allowed to speak before being given permission.
Sorry.
Not everyone is accustomed to our customs.
That's why it's important to choose a partner with the same background as you.
Yura is not so different from me, Mom.
And I'm very certain
that she is willing to learn our family customs.
Isn't that right, honey?
Here's the thing, honey.
Currently, Robert lives in America, taking up his master's degree,
but he also has a business there.
His little brother should've gone with him to America.
But you always wanted to do something different.
Good evening, everyone! Forgive me if I'm late.
Please have a seat.
Tian.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
It turns out that this rascal is good at finding a girlfriend.
Come, let's eat.
Please serve your girlfriend first before you serve yourself, okay?
Do you both attend the same university?
That's right, sir.
I mean, Mr. Salim.
Come on, please don't be shy.
Just like Tian, you can call me "Dad."
Well, Rachel has told me a lot about your relationship.
And basically, I have no objection.
Tian is old enough.
He has been taking care of himself since high school.
So whatever he decides, I will support him.
No problem at all. Isn't that right, honey?
There's absolutely no problem here.
Everything is settled.
But there's one thing
that I want you to do before I can give you my blessings.
What is that, Dad?
It's your brother, Robert.
He was careless in managing his business in Los Angeles.
So now his company is experiencing bad credit.
I've sent my auditors from England, but they also couldn't handle it.
I don't trust them.
And I will not give that to them.
So I want you to go there and handle this problem.
But I don't know anything about Robert's business.
Did you know anything about noodles when you first started that business?
You didn't know, right?
That noodle thing is just a small business.
It's as simple as that.
And I'm pretty sure you can handle it.
How long should I be there, Dad?
How long did it take for you to develop your noodle business?
A week.
Right. That means it's more or less the same thing.
But of course if you need more time, and you need to stay longer,
then you could always ask your girlfriend to catch up with you,
and you can get married there.
Why not?
Everything can be arranged.
Don't worry about your mother. I'll talk to her later.
Son…
It's nothing.
Just finish your meal. Go on.
It seems that love isn't just about being together
or merely just an expression,
but it's also a blessing in disguise
when we throw away all our desires.
I didn't expect your father to be that kind.
Same here.
If you ask me
if this is the path for me,
maybe this will be my next choice.
For how long?
I don't know.
Please allow me to enjoy it first.
No, you can't. Close your eyes.
-All right. -Don't peek. Close your eyes.
Now you can open your eyes.
I, Cristian Subagyo,
and the woman beside me…
Yura Diandra,
will be getting married in two months.
And one more thing.
Because tonight is a very special night,
I will be treating all of you here to Yoi Mie. Free of charge!
So order anything you like.
Go ahead, but please don't bring it home, okay?
Yura.
Why did you come here?
You're still not well, right?
He insisted on coming, Yura.
It was I who insisted. Nisa didn't have the heart to say it.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome…
Gerry Hartono!
Gerry!
Gerry!
Oh, where
Should I look for you
I am crying
All by myself
My heart
Is always longing to see you
Just for you
I will sing this song
To my dearest father
I want to sing this song
Even though
Tears stream down on my face
Father, please listen to me
I want to see you
Even though
It's only in my dreams
Just look…
All set.
Don't forget to come back.
-Okay? -Sure.
Take care of Yura for me, okay?
I'd better go now, honey.
This is your mother's bracelet.
That's why I'm giving it to you.
Thank you.
Don't be sad. I won't be away for long.
Mr. and Mrs. Somad!
Have a safe flight!
Come back, okay?
Come on.
DEAR YURA, HOW ARE YOU?
LA FEELS A LOT COLDER WITHOUT YOU HERE.
MISSING YOU AND NOT SEEING YOU
IS LIKE COMPOSING A SONG WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN SUNG.
Yura?
What's the matter?
I think I'm catching a cold. I need to sleep.
Yura.
Mr. Burhan is missing.
What do you mean by missing?
He's missing. He never got home.
What do you mean?
They say there are a lot of activists being abducted.
Abducted?
That's right. By the police.
The situation out there is very terrifying.
Even college students have mobilized.
It's really scary out there--
-Oka! -Yura?
-This is bad, right? Come here! -What is it, Mom?
-This is bad, right? -What are you talking about?
There are a lot of confusing words. I don't understand this.
"Put forward…"
"Position…"
-What does that mean? -I don't know. It's chaos out there.
I'll read it later.

The total is 1,000 rupiah.
Thank you very much.
Ian?
Where are you?
Are you okay?
Please call me back.
I want to tell you something important.
You're already here?
-Yes. -Put it in the back.
Sure.
Yura?
Give me his phone number. Let me try to call him.
Give it to me.
It's really bad.
Oh, my god!
What's that?
Oka!
Oka?
-Oka? -Yes, Dad.
-Have you seen the news? -No, I haven't. What's wrong?
Come here.
That's the situation in Jakarta about an hour ago.
Allegedly, the riot was caused by angry passengers
who didn't receive any explanation
from the airlines regarding their flights.
Several properties like computers, telephones, tables, chairs, walls,
and even windows were smashed all around the counters.
They burned it.
Where are you going, Yura?
To Jakarta.
Are you crazy?
Oka!
I want to know where Tian is right now!
I want to know what his parents will say!
But not like this, Yura! Didn't you see the situation in Jakarta?
What am I supposed to do?
Sit here and do nothing?
Like a fool?
All right, let me take you there.
I'm going alone.
How do you plan to do that? By plane or by train?
Didn't you see what was going on?
Let's go.
REFORMATION IS A MUST
THIS BELONGS TO THE NATIVES
-Turn left up here, Oka. -Here?
There it is. That's the front gate.
Are you serious?
Is this really his house?
-Who is that? -I don't know.
-Is this the house, Yura? -Yes.
-Excuse me, sir. -Yes?
-Can I help you? - I'm Yura.
I'm Cristian's friend who came here last time. Do you remember?
The young master has many friends, especially girls.
-I agree. -That's right!
-What's going on here? -Grace!
What a coincidence. I want to ask how Cristian is doing.
Who are you?
What?
I'm Yura, Cristian's would-be wife!
A week ago, a woman also came here and claimed to be Cristian's wife.
What is this?
I've gotten used to handling these kinds of dramas.
The family here moved to America before the riots began.
So there's no one here.
If you really are Master Cristian's would-be wife,
I'm sure you'll be in America by now,
because his wedding will be held next week.
-Take care of this. -Cristian…
What wedding, ma'am?
-She's his fiancée. -He already proposed!
-Ma'am! -Go on now.
-Hey, you are trespassing! -Out of my way!
-Mister! -Just get out of here!
-Grace! -Just leave at once!
Don't force your way in! Hey!
Listen to me!
If you want to be a con artist, do it at home. Don't do it here!
Get out!
Let's go, Yura.
They're crazy.
NATIVE INDONESIANS
THIS BELONGS TO THE NATIVES
The most useless thing in life
is regretting a decision
and then seeing yourself
begging for hope.
THIS BELONGS TO THE NATIVES
Yura!
Yura, you haven't eaten yet, right? Come on, let's eat.
Look, I made you some noodles.
Look, Yura. The egg is cooked over medium.
Look.
Can you tell Yura to come and eat dinner, honey?
Sure, I'll do that.
Yura!
Let's eat.
Yura?
Let's have dinner.
Yura?
Yura?
Maybe she's sleeping.
Yura!
Yura?
Wake up, Yura! Come and eat your breakfast.
We're going to have a guest from Jogja.
Yura?
Yura!
Yura!
Yura?
Mom! Dad!
Yura!
Yura!
Yura!
Tian.
Please pick up.
-How is she, Doc? -She's recovering, ma'am.
She lost a lot of blood,
but good thing she was brought here just in time, so she will survive.
And thank God her baby is okay.
Baby?
Yes. Your daughter is two months pregnant.
Can I speak to her husband?
I'm her husband, Doc.
Come with me.
Is that true?
This is not like Ian.
I know him pretty well.
I don't believe he has the heart to do this.
I'm sure this is all his parents' doing. I'm sure of it.
Okay, that's enough.
What did the doctor say about Yura?
I don't believe that he's wicked.
What?
What did the doctor say?
He told me
Yura is having severe depression.
So I need to take care of her and keep her emotions stable.
Come on. Wake up, Yura.
We are all here for you.
We all love you, Yura.
We are here for you.
Yura?
Yura?
Yura?
Yura?
-Got you! -Yura!
You better watch out! I'm going to catch you!
I'm going to tickle you!
You are precious to me!
Mom.
Are you afraid of losing me?
I am so afraid of losing you.
Your mother Diandra and our father Gerry both have this bracelet.
When you were born, her bracelet was given to you.
Now, you can also have Dad's bracelet.
Please don't be sad anymore, Yura.
You're not alone, you know?
We're all here for you.
Sometimes…
when we really feel we have lost everything,
the people we used to hate and stay away from,
are the ones who will be there for us.
Yura.
May I speak to you for a minute?
When your father and I got married,
honestly,
I didn't know how to be a mother to you.
Maybe it's because I've never had a child before.
That's why I didn't know what to do.
When Nisa was born,
I thought…
I could have a little experience on how to deal with children.
But…
But it made me drift even farther away from you.
I don't know why,
but you were like a nuisance to me…
especially when your father wasn't successful anymore.
His album sold poorly on the market.
They didn't offer him opportunities to perform anymore.
Meanwhile, our needs have increased.
And then I tried something else to help our family.
I tried starting a business, selling jewelry to wealthy people.
That's when I met Mrs. Sadewo, until…
That's why I…
Your fate should've been much better than this, Yura.
This is all my fault.
I am the one who caused all of this.
I have accepted this fate.
You have to be happy, okay?
Whatever it takes, I will atone for my sins.
Please forgive me.
Hi. It hasn't started yet?
It's going to start soon.
Mrs. Indah, my grandma wants me to give this to Yura.
Akar fatimah.
What's that for?
Akar fatimah is very good at inducing labor, Yura.
I'll boil it for her at home later.
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
please sit on the available mat in the middle.
-Wait here, okay? -Okay.
Just walk slowly.
Yura, where is your husband?
-This is her husband, ma'am. -Right.
Come on. It's all right.
-Please sit down, sir. -Come on.
Just sit there.
So what are your plans for the future, Yura?
Giving birth and raising this child.
Maybe I'll go to college again.
Isn't it cute
bringing my baby to class?
It's getting late. I need to go home now.
Give my regards to the little one.
Hey, handsome.
How much? One portion?
I think Oka is the perfect guy to be your husband.
That's nonsense.
What's wrong with that?
You and Cristian aren't officially married, right?
Yes, but that's just ridiculous.
Oka has been my friend since the beginning.
Well, I don't want to burden him with my problems.
Have you asked him about that?
I don't have to ask him. I'm sure everyone understands that.
Yura, when a man has fallen in love,
I'm sure he'll sacrifice just about anything.
She doesn't believe that? Do you need proof?
No, I don't.
All right then, at least ask him, okay?
-Just ask him, okay? -I don't want to.
Just ask him. It will be fine, okay?
I won't be asking him.
Mom!
-What's wrong, Yura? -Her water broke.
Nisa, call a cab, okay?
Oka!
Yura, are you okay?
-Oka, her water just broke! -What?
Come here! Quick!
Honey, please stay calm. Oka!
-Quickly, call a cab. -What's wrong, Yura?
Come on.
Hello, Mom? Yes, she just went into the operating room.
It might take two hours.
Mom, please bring Yura's clothes, okay?
Yes, and also her towel. Bring a clean one, okay?
You can also bring a perfume.
Thank you.
Come on, just relax. Yura is strong, you know?
The important thing is she doesn't feel alone.
Yura's mother, please accompany your daughter inside.
Can her husband come too?
I'm sorry, ma'am. Only one person is allowed inside.
-Then her husband should go in. -Why me?
-It has to be you. -Why doesn't he want to go?
He wants to accompany her!
-Go! He's coming, Nurse. -Okay, this way.
He really wants to go.
-Now. -Why don't you?
Go on, it's okay. He wants to accompany her, Nurse.
-Come on, just get inside! -Let's go, sir. They're waiting for us.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
Just relax, ma'am.
-First, I need to check it. -Come on, sir.
The dilation is now nine centimeters. Just relax.
Just relax, ma'am.
It's your first time, right?
Please come in, sir. Go ahead.
Take a deep breath.
Now, push.
-You can get close to her. -Please help her out, okay?
Just a moment, sir.
You're almost there, ma'am. Just a bit more.
Take another deep breath.
The baby's born, ma'am! It's a girl!
Is the baby born, Mom?
-Here you go! -Thank you, Nisa.
-Here you go, Mr. Somad. -Thank you.
And this is for you.
-Mom, can you help with this? -Sure.
-I need to help Yura. -All right, honey.
Please drink it.
Hello.
What are you going to call her?
You haven't given her a name since we left the hospital.
That's right. What are you going to call her?
A name is a parent's wish, Yura. Isn't that right, Gerry?
Your cheeks are so chubby.
Hi. What is your name?
What do you think, Oka?
Why are you asking me?
You're her mother.
I can't give her a name.
You're good at choosing a name.
You're the one who named our stall.
-And it's very profitable. -Hey.
Hold on a second.
How can you name this beautiful baby like some stall?
-That's right! Don't do that. -What do you mean by that?
All right then.
What's her name then?
Diandra…
Puspita.
Look, she smiled. Diandra Puspita.
What does it mean?
Diandra is the name of Yura's late mother.
It means elegant and strong.
This child will grow to become a very beautiful girl,
and strong like her mother and grandmother.
Diandra Puspita Hartono.
-It's a good name, right? -Yes, it's good.
Diandra Puspita…
Saputra?
I know this will sound ridiculous.
But…
I can't deny my feelings anymore.
I want to have a happy family like Mr. and Mrs. Somad…
who can give birth to an amazing child like Oka.
I know this will sound very weird…
A woman…
A woman proposing to a man first.
But one thing's for sure…
I'm very happy to have a friend like you.
The person who I have chosen
to give my future to.
But if you refuse, I don't mind either.
I don't want you to think
that I'm giving my burden to you.
I don't know what to say, Yura.
You don't need to answer now, Oka.
I sincerely accept it.
I still consider you my best friend.
Hey, let's get out of here. Why are we still here anyway?
We need to wait for Yura.
It's all done, right?
Yura's marriage has been set.
Whatever happens, she's still our friend. We need to protect her.
-What if something happens to her? -What will happen to her?
Well, anything can happen to her.
Why aren't you concerned at all?
All right, whatever.
Quickly, start the car!
-What happened? -Just go now, Oka!
I promise you…
I will never hurt your feelings.
Yura! Mom!
I love you, Yura.
I accept it, Yura.
I accept that this child will be named Diandra Puspita Saputra.
Come and give me a hug!
Finally, I have a granddaughter from the Hartono family!
-Why are you crying, Dad? -You made me cry!
Once again,
love isn't just about being together or just an expression,
nor is it just a wish for a blessing to come.
Love is all things.
There's also sacrifice in love.
There's always something to fight for.
Not just our desires alone,
but all the people who sincerely helped us.
Will this be the ending of my love story?
I don't know yet.
